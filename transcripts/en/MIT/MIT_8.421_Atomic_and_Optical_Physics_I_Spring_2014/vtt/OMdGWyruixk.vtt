00:00:20.465 --> 00:00:21.930
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.860
Then let's go back to
our discussion of what

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:34.050
happens to classical and quantum
mechanical magnetic moments

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.200
when they are exposed
to magnetic fields.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:48.830
I just want to remind you
of what we did last class

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:57.450
and what we want
to wrap up today.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.790
This is rapid adiabatic passage.

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.650
I mentioned to you and
explained it to you

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.390
that rapid adiabatic
passage is a powerful way

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.430
to manipulate a classical
and quantum system,

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.170
and what we discussed is that
when a spin points in the up

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.810
direction and you
sweep the resonance

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.610
of an oscillating magnetic
field-- the frequency

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.400
of an oscillating magnetic
field, through the resonance,

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.920
you create an effective magnetic
field in the moving frame which

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.410
will rotate.

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.080
And the atom, when the
change is done adiabatically,

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.080
will follow the rotation and
therefore invert the spin.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.890
So it's a perfect,
very robust method

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.905
to invert population
in spin systems.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.390
What I want to pick up
today is the question,

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.120
how slow is adiabatic.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.040
We have to fulfill an
adiabatic condition

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.470
and we have already
an idea already

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:07.940
of what the adiabatic
condition is

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.490
but now we want to derive it.

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.090
That we had this
picture of a spin

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.950
which is rapidly precessing.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:21.060
It always precesses
around the direction

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.700
of the effective magnetic field,
and the condition adiabadicity

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.190
is that the rotation of the
effective magnetic field

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.060
has to be much slower
than the precession.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.430
Let me just make it clear
by a counter example.

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.310
If the atom precesses
around the magnetic field

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.330
and the magnetic field
would suddenly jump,

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.320
then the atom would
now start precessing

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.160
about the new direction
of the magnetic field

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.870
and it would have
completely changed its angle

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.560
relative to the magnetic field.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.660
It would have lost its alignment
with the magnetic field.

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.040
So you clearly see
that the condition is

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.570
the direction of the
magnetic field must not jump,

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.330
and the only other time scheme
is the frequency of the Larmor

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.510
precession, so our
condition for adiabadicity

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:11.100
is the rotation of the
effective magnetic field

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.445
has to be slow compared to
the precession frequency.

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:24.597
And so we want to now
derive from that condition

00:03:24.597 --> 00:03:25.930
the conditions for adiabadicity.

00:03:28.586 --> 00:03:31.610
And just as an outlook
to make it interesting,

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.150
what I will derive for you
in the classical picture

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.260
is now something
which you will later

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.280
encounter as the
Landau-Zener parameter.

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.120
But Landau-Zener sweeps, we
talk about it later today

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.030
is a quantum mechanical version
of rapid adiabatic passage,

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.990
but we now get
classically a result,

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:51.720
which will feature the
Landau-Zener parameter.

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:04.000
So with that, let us write
down what we want to look at.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:13.180
It is adiabatic condition,
and to write it down in words

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:19.350
is that the Larmor
frequency, omega L, which

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:24.120
is given by the
effective magnetic field,

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:30.970
has to be much larger
than theta dot.

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.140
Now things in general
are rather complicated.

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.240
If we are far away
from resonance,

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.110
you change the frequency,
but the effective field

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:40.550
is not changing a lot.

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:45.050
The critical moment is really
when we have the real field, we

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.760
add the fictitious field
and that cause a rotation.

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:53.120
The critical moment is
when we are near resonance.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.540
So in other words, we have
to fulfill an inequality.

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:59.360
The left side has to be
larger than the right side,

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:05.910
but the left side
is actually smallest

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.670
in the vicinity
of the resonance,

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:12.340
and the angle theta
dot is actually

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.820
largest near resonance.

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.475
That's when it sort of
quickly goes to 90 degrees.

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:25.420
So therefore, if we want to find
the condition of adiabadicity,

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:28.210
we can derive it by
looking at the region

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:29.105
around the resonance.

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:40.490
So the effective magnetic
field is the real field

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:47.200
minus the fictitious
field caused

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.520
by the rotation by
the transformation

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:51.735
into the rotating frame.

00:05:54.740 --> 00:06:04.410
So we have the magnetic field
at an angle theta with respect

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:04.993
to the z-axis.

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:14.750
I've just written down
the z component for you,

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:20.580
and the transverse component
is-- so this is this component

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.521
and the transverse component
is the amplitude of our drive

00:06:23.521 --> 00:06:24.020
field B1.

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:29.035
So we can just read
it form the diagram.

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:39.060
The resonance data
is 90 degrees,

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:43.450
and the correction
angle is whatever

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:49.420
we have of the effective
z field over B1,

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:54.080
and that means that the
derivative, the angle theta

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:58.220
dot, the angular velocity
at which the magnetic field

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:04.350
rotates, there's a time
derivative because we

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:06.180
sweep the frequency.

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:10.260
So therefore, theta
dot is nothing else

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:16.960
than omega dot, the sweep
rate of the frequency divided

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:18.120
by gamma B1.

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:29.975
But gamma B1 is nothing else
than the Rabi frequency.

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:40.650
And on resonance, the Larmor
frequency is just a Rabi

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:46.220
frequency, because on
resonance-- sorry for repeating

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:51.240
myself-- the fictitious field
has canceled the bias field,

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:54.450
and the only field left
is the rotating field,

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:58.510
but the rotating field
is the Rabi frequency

00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:00.780
with a gamma factor.

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:07.520
So therefore, we have
the adiabatic condition

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:10.490
that omega dot
over omega Rabi has

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:17.180
to be smaller than omega Rabi
or to say it inverts the change

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:20.820
delta omega of your
drive frequency,

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:27.330
the change delta omega
in one Ravi period

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:29.370
has to be smaller than
the Rabi frequency.

00:08:34.409 --> 00:08:37.080
So omega has units of frequency.

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:41.350
Omega dot is a derivative that's
in units of frequency squared,

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:44.120
and this is to be smaller than
the Rabi frequency squared.

00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:01.280
You find that actually
quite often if you

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:05.550
do an adiabatic change
of your trap frequency,

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:09.610
things are adiabatic as long
as the change of the trap

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:13.250
frequency in one period
of the trap frequency

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:15.210
is smaller than
the trap frequency,

00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:18.240
and you find something else
that the derivative of your trap

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:21.760
frequency has to be smaller
than the trap frequency squared.

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:23.310
So these are
adiabatic conditions,

00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:27.430
when you tighten up magnetic or
optical confinement for atoms.

00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:29.450
So this is very, very genetic.

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:32.090
The small rate of the
frequency you change

00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:34.910
has to be smaller than the
relevant frequency squared.

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:41.020
As I said, we come
back to that when

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:45.610
we do the quantized treatment
of rapid adiabatic passage

00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:48.130
and we encounter
that combination

00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:51.010
in the Landau-Zener
parameter, which

00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:55.530
takes us to our next topic.

00:09:55.530 --> 00:10:01.760
We want to now talk
about quantized spin

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:02.870
in a magnetic field.

00:10:12.549 --> 00:10:14.590
And one of the first things
I will be telling you

00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:16.760
is that everything
we have learned

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:20.410
about the classical magnetic
moment you don't have

00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:23.080
to unlearn or
re-learn, it exactly

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:26.020
applies to the quantum spin.

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:34.600
Before we look at
the Hamiltonian

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:41.530
and the standard Hamiltonian
for two-level system,

00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:45.450
let us first look at
something more general, which

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:47.655
is Heisenberg
equations of motion.

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:57.570
So we want to write down
the differential equation,

00:10:57.570 --> 00:11:01.290
the equation of motion
for expectation values.

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:15.950
So for an atom in
a magnetic field,

00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:20.470
our Hamiltonian is simply
the same Hamiltonian,

00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:24.370
which involves the gyromagnetic
ratio, the angular momentum

00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:28.120
operator, and the
magnetic field.

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:34.220
And you know from
quantum mechanics

00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:47.760
that Heisenberg's equation
of motion for any operator

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:53.980
are simply that the time
derivative of the operator

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:58.410
equals the commutator
with the Hamiltonian.

00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:05.770
In some cases, if you have
an explicit time derivative

00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:09.230
of the operator,
you have to edit,

00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:11.390
but we are talking here
about the angular momentum

00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:13.510
operator which has no
explicit time dependents.

00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:22.410
So we are interested
in the operator which

00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:30.370
describes the magnetic moment,
but the magnetic moment

00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:32.920
is nothing else than
the gyromagnetic ratio

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:38.510
times the angular momentum.

00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:42.880
So therefore, the
relevant commutator

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:51.820
is the commutator of the
Hamiltonian with the angular

00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:54.100
momentum operator.

00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:57.350
Just to remind you,
the Hamiltonian

00:12:57.350 --> 00:13:01.530
was proportional to z.

00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:09.310
So what we are talking about is
commutators, not surprisingly,

00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:14.620
between the angular
momentum operators

00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:25.180
and those commutators are
just this cyclic commutation

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:29.090
involving the epsilon tensor.

00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:36.100
So if you just put that
in component by component,

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:43.260
you realize immediately that the
operator equation for the time

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:47.930
derivative of the
magnetic moment

00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:55.170
is nothing else than the cross
product, the vector product,

00:13:55.170 --> 00:13:57.820
of the operator of
the magnetic moment

00:13:57.820 --> 00:13:59.920
times the magnetic field.

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:11.400
To commence, this is
exact, but also it

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:15.470
looks exactly like
the classical result.

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:28.130
Well, you would say it's
an operator equation.

00:14:28.130 --> 00:14:31.610
Usually operator
equation some of them

00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:34.620
are pretty useless because you
can't calculate the operators,

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:37.670
but in this case,
we can immediately

00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:40.730
take the expectation
value, so we

00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:44.170
can get some immediately
meaningfully equation

00:14:44.170 --> 00:14:53.900
namely that the
expectation value follows

00:14:53.900 --> 00:15:02.030
the same equation,
and this tells us

00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:04.310
that whenever we have
a quantum system,

00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:07.390
it has a magnetic moment.

00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:10.680
In an applied external
magnetic field,

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:15.360
the result is simply rotation,
precession, and this is exact.

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:17.210
It's not a classical
approximation.

00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:19.365
It's an exact result
for quantum mechanics.

00:15:22.890 --> 00:15:30.180
So the way how we derived
it makes it obvious that

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:37.710
it's an exact result, which is
valid not only for spin-1/2,

00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:39.980
but it is valid for any spin.

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:44.600
If you have a magnetic moment
corresponding to a spin of 10 H

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:49.420
bar, this spin follows the same
equation of motion as spin-1/2.

00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:59.450
Of course, a special case
is valid for spin-1/2,

00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:04.200
but spin-1/2 is isomorphous
to a two-level system.

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:08.140
Any two-level system can be
regarded as spin-1/2 system,

00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:13.110
therefore, this geometric
interpretation that

00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:17.250
the dynamics of the quantum
system is just a precession

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:21.115
rigorously, exactly applies
to any two-level system.

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:38.880
It's also valid, and this
will be relevant for atoms,

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:41.830
if we have composite
angular momentum.

00:16:48.010 --> 00:16:51.500
For instance, we will encounter
the total angular momentum

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:55.050
F of an atom which
has components

00:16:55.050 --> 00:16:56.970
from the orbital
motion of the electron,

00:16:56.970 --> 00:17:00.450
the spin of the electron,
and the spin of the nucleus.

00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:02.890
But if we have such
an angular momentum,

00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:07.450
F, the creation of motion
is it will precess around

00:17:07.450 --> 00:17:10.720
a magnetic field.

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:26.810
Well the small print here is,
unless the B field is so strong

00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:29.580
that it de-couples
the components

00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:39.490
or that it breaks up the
coupling of the different parts

00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:40.540
of the angular momentum.

00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:48.330
In other words, we have
simply assumed here

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:52.890
that magnetic moment is
gamma times angular momentum,

00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:55.630
and that requires that
the angular momentum are

00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:57.126
coupled in a certain way.

00:17:57.126 --> 00:17:58.500
If we don't fully
understand what

00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:00.850
coupling of angular
momentum is, we really

00:18:00.850 --> 00:18:03.480
talk about that when we
talk about atomic structure.

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:07.520
So as long as the spin state
coupled to one total spin,

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:09.480
this total spin
will just precess.

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:19.340
This picture of
precession will also

00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:37.590
be valid for a system
of N two-level systems

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:44.200
coupled to an external
field, and this

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:52.550
will be the example of
Dicke superrradiance, which

00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:54.830
we will discussed towards
the end of the course.

00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:08.260
So very simple result,
but very powerful,

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:10.540
and this is your
permission whenever

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:13.530
you encounter any of
the systems to see

00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:15.700
a vector precessing
in your head.

00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:16.490
This is exact.

00:19:28.690 --> 00:19:31.025
So we've talked about
Heisenberg equation of motion

00:19:31.025 --> 00:19:33.150
for general spin, but--
you have a question, Nancy?

00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:36.935
AUDIENCE: What did you mean
by N two-level systems here?

00:19:36.935 --> 00:19:39.350
Are we talking about
coherent systems

00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:42.731
or non-coherent systems?

00:19:42.731 --> 00:19:47.350
PROFESSOR: We talk about
in two-level systems

00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:52.100
and to be more specific the
coupling comes because they all

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:54.320
talk to the same magnetic field.

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:58.270
So we have in two-level
systems connected

00:19:58.270 --> 00:20:01.710
to the modes of the
electromagnetic field.

00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:03.440
We start with the
symmetric state.

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:05.250
The coupling is
symmetric and that

00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:09.310
preserves the symmetry
of the atomic state.

00:20:09.310 --> 00:20:14.920
In other words, we will have
a situation where the angular

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:19.110
momentum is the maximum
angular momentum we

00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:22.420
can get in two-level
system, and the dynamics

00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:25.330
of this two-level system,
the description of Dicke

00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:29.410
superradiance has the
geometric visualization

00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:30.720
of this precessing motion.

00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:35.880
I know I'm not
explaining it exactly.

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:39.230
I want to sort of whet your
appetite for what comes later

00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:42.839
and also sort of prep you that
some of the simple pictures

00:20:42.839 --> 00:20:44.380
will really carry
through the course.

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:51.670
OK, so this is for
very general spin.

00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:56.810
Let's now talk about
features of, yes,

00:20:56.810 --> 00:21:01.370
the most important spin for us,
namely the two-level system,

00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:02.680
which is spin-1/2.

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:27.530
Well, the most generic
system is an electron

00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:38.170
in a magnetic field B times ez.

00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:46.465
And well, why don't we start
with a clicker question.

00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:54.540
So the question is, what
is the level structure

00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:57.610
of the electron in
the magnetic field?

00:21:57.610 --> 00:22:01.970
It's a two-level system,
and you have two options

00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:06.940
A and B. One option is the
upper state is spin up.

00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:17.740
The ground state is spin
down or the opposite.

00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:24.800
So in other words, and
tell me whether an electron

00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:27.620
is in the lower state
when the speed is up

00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:29.250
or when the spin is down.

00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:40.440
You would say it's
a stupid definition,

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:42.730
but we talk all the
time about an electron

00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:44.960
is in the spin down
state or the spin

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:47.900
up state, which is the lower
energy state of the electron.

00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:54.720
So I think by exchanging
the better recent number

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:57.730
of responses has
considerably gone up.

00:23:04.291 --> 00:23:04.790
OK.

00:23:10.030 --> 00:23:14.770
The answer is the electron
is in the ground state.

00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:24.190
Spin down is the lowest
state for the electron.

00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:31.890
To say it in words, of
course, a compass needle

00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:34.430
wants to be aligned
with the magnetic field.

00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:41.450
So you want the magnetic
moment to be aligned

00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:43.330
with the magnetic
field, and that

00:23:43.330 --> 00:23:45.340
means the magnetic
moment has to point

00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:49.300
in the plus e direction,
which up but the electron has

00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:52.500
negative charge, the
gamma factor is negative,

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:56.170
and that's why for the
electron, the vector of the spin

00:23:56.170 --> 00:24:00.360
and the vector of the
magnetic moment are opposite.

00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:02.700
So just try to find some
main-mode technical thing.

00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:04.380
The electron lives
in the basement.

00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:06.630
It wants to be down, spin down.

00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:10.170
This is the lowest
state for the electron.

00:24:10.170 --> 00:24:13.270
However, if you
have a system which

00:24:13.270 --> 00:24:16.500
has a positive gyromagnetic
ratio, which would correspond

00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:26.820
to, well, positive charge,
nucleus if it has somewhat

00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:31.590
normal magnetic moment, then
in that case, the spin up state

00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:33.870
is less energetic than
the spin down state.

00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:39.920
So let me just write that down.

00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:45.200
So the correct
answer is this one,

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:50.470
and it involves that
gamma is negative.

00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:52.580
The gamma is a
gyromagnetic ratio,

00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:55.270
the ratio between magnetic
moment and angular momentum,

00:24:55.270 --> 00:24:57.065
and for negative
charges, it's negative.

00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:04.400
For positive gamma, the
situation is inverted.

00:25:07.770 --> 00:25:10.850
So let's just use for
a moment the result

00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:13.860
we got from Heisenberg's
equation of motion.

00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:16.150
We know the classical result.

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:21.710
We have already derived
for the classic spin,

00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:24.270
the classical result
for the expectation

00:25:24.270 --> 00:25:25.620
value of the magnetic moment.

00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:31.420
But now I want to sort of
relate it to something quantum

00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:34.920
mechanical because we know that
the classical solution equals

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:37.660
the quantum mechanical solution.

00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:45.330
So if you have a
two-level system,

00:25:45.330 --> 00:25:48.900
the z component of
the magnetic moment

00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:57.450
is the difference between
spin down and spin up.

00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:04.860
And because of conservation
probability, p up and p down

00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:11.180
is unity, we can also
write that as 2 times--

00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:13.880
let me now introduce
e for excited state,

00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:16.750
just I know it's hard to keep
track of spin up, spin down.

00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:19.450
I want to make sure that I
mean now the excited state,

00:26:19.450 --> 00:26:23.850
so the excited state for
the electron is spin up.

00:26:23.850 --> 00:26:41.550
So we have this condition, so
therefore, the excited state

00:26:41.550 --> 00:26:48.070
fraction of a two-level system
is related to the expectation

00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:53.150
value of the magnetic
moment in that wave,

00:26:53.150 --> 00:26:56.320
and now we want to use the
classical result we derived.

00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:05.550
We derived the
classical result when

00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:21.170
for t equals 0 all the spins
were in the ground state,

00:27:21.170 --> 00:27:26.150
and by using the result
we derived previously,

00:27:26.150 --> 00:27:28.930
we have the 1/2 from
the previous line

00:27:28.930 --> 00:27:33.400
and then the magnetic
moment, mu z.

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:41.510
We found an expression which
involved the Rabi frequency,

00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:55.108
and the off resonant
Rabi frequency

00:27:55.108 --> 00:28:02.290
are sine square generalized Rabi
frequency times time over 2.

00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:10.200
So the two factors
of 1/2 and 1/2

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:17.230
cancel, and what we find now for
the quantum mechanical system

00:28:17.230 --> 00:28:19.930
using Heisenberg's
equation of motion

00:28:19.930 --> 00:28:23.560
is that if you prepare
a system initially

00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:27.290
in the ground state,
the excited state

00:28:27.290 --> 00:28:33.460
probability, the fraction,
the excited state oscillates

00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:37.300
with a Rabi frequency,
and this is,

00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:41.660
I think, the second time in this
course and not the last time

00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:44.150
that we see the
Rabi, that we obtain,

00:28:44.150 --> 00:28:45.620
the Rabi transition probability.

00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:56.300
But let's go further.

00:28:56.300 --> 00:28:58.400
We have now discussed
the classical spin.

00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:01.540
We have sort of done classical
quantum correspondence

00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:03.730
with Heisenberg's
equation of motion.

00:29:03.730 --> 00:29:09.490
We know that this in general,
it implies Rabi oscillations,

00:29:09.490 --> 00:29:15.200
but now we want to go deeper
into the quantum domain

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:19.440
by talking about the
spin-1/2 Hamiltonian.

00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:29.880
So in other words, we want to
go beyond expectation values.

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:37.490
We want to talk about
the wave function itself.

00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:49.200
So the Hamiltonian,
which we will

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:53.250
use for major parts
in this course,

00:29:53.250 --> 00:29:56.519
it's one of the fundamental
Hamiltonians in physics.

00:29:56.519 --> 00:29:58.310
Of course, there's the
harmonic oscillator.

00:29:58.310 --> 00:30:00.630
There is a hydrogen
atom, but then there's

00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:06.000
this Hamiltonian, which is a
two-level system with splitting

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.790
omega naught.

00:30:07.790 --> 00:30:17.170
And then we make, which
is often a simplification,

00:30:17.170 --> 00:30:26.270
where we use a pure exponential,
so a single frequency

00:30:26.270 --> 00:30:30.890
in complex notation where
the complex exponential e

00:30:30.890 --> 00:30:34.170
to the i omega t
is the drive term.

00:30:37.610 --> 00:30:40.100
So this is one of the
simplest Hamiltonian

00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:41.230
for this kind of system.

00:30:41.230 --> 00:30:46.130
It's a two-level system with a
splitting, and now it is driven

00:30:46.130 --> 00:30:49.780
and the simplest drive term
is not cosine omega t or sine

00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:51.810
omega t as we will see.

00:30:51.810 --> 00:30:55.430
The simplest drive term
is e to the i omega t.

00:30:55.430 --> 00:30:58.870
So this is now our Hamiltonian.

00:30:58.870 --> 00:31:02.740
and since it is
so important, let

00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:14.580
me ask you a clicker question
whether this Hamiltonian can

00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:32.775
be exactly realized in nature
or it is an approximation.

00:31:44.710 --> 00:31:51.550
For instance, that you always
have cosine omega t as a drive,

00:31:51.550 --> 00:31:53.880
and cosine omega t is
e to the plus i omega t

00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:55.410
and e to the minus i omega t.

00:31:55.410 --> 00:31:57.700
And then maybe with the
rotating wave approximation,

00:31:57.700 --> 00:31:59.430
you throw away a term.

00:31:59.430 --> 00:32:01.500
So I sort of wanted
to ask you, is this

00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:05.620
an idealization that we
have a coupling which

00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:10.240
is a simple, complex
exponential, this nature always

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:15.600
more complicated or
is there a simple way

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:17.470
to realize this
Hamiltonian in nature?

00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:21.850
So what do you think?

00:32:36.510 --> 00:32:37.980
Stop display.

00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:45.470
What's funny about that?

00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:46.853
AUDIENCE: Equal to.

00:32:46.853 --> 00:32:48.700
AUDIENCE: There are
two [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:50.700
PROFESSOR: Oh, they
couldn't make up their mind.

00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:57.660
The system should
reject those votes.

00:32:57.660 --> 00:33:02.290
Anyway, it means most of
you anticipate what I want

00:33:02.290 --> 00:33:05.950
to derive to you that we can
actually exactly get this

00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:11.210
Hamiltonian and indeed, this is
the Hamiltonian I will derive

00:33:11.210 --> 00:33:14.510
for you in the next few minutes,
which is the Hamiltonian

00:33:14.510 --> 00:33:21.960
of spin-1/2 in a magnetic field
coupled to a rotating magnetic

00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:23.720
field.

00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:26.210
So we start out
with fields which

00:33:26.210 --> 00:33:29.700
are real, real field,
no imaginary numbers,

00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:30.940
no complex numbers.

00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:34.410
These are real fields, but
when we write down how the real

00:33:34.410 --> 00:33:39.706
fields couple to spin-1/2, we
get e to the i omega t and e

00:33:39.706 --> 00:33:42.025
to the minus omega t
without any approximation.

00:33:46.330 --> 00:33:52.430
So since at least 80%
of you know the result,

00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:58.770
just regard it as an exercise to
introduce how we spin matrices

00:33:58.770 --> 00:34:02.850
in a nice way, also
this will help you

00:34:02.850 --> 00:34:06.770
how to do pre-set number 1.

00:34:06.770 --> 00:34:12.750
So the Hamiltonian is the spin
coupled to a magnetic field,

00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:18.130
and if we express that by
angular momentum operators,

00:34:18.130 --> 00:34:20.949
the gyromagnetic ratio
it involves the operator

00:34:20.949 --> 00:34:22.603
for the spin in the z direction.

00:34:25.170 --> 00:34:30.920
So the two-level system has
a splitting of H bar omega,

00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:35.260
so it's plus 1/2
minus 1/2 H bar omega,

00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:37.540
and that means
the diagonal part,

00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:47.969
the non-driven part is simply
given by the Pauli spin matrix

00:34:47.969 --> 00:34:55.719
sigma z and omega naught
is the energy splitting,

00:34:55.719 --> 00:35:00.220
which is proportional to
the applied magnetic field.

00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:04.580
And up-down, and
excited and ground

00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:15.280
are the eigenstates of this
Hamiltonian with energies

00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:19.290
plus minus H bar
omega naught over 2.

00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:31.450
So this is the same Hamiltonian,
but now add a real rotating B

00:35:31.450 --> 00:35:35.520
field B1.

00:35:40.510 --> 00:35:46.950
So the drive Hamiltonian H1
is the same magnetic moment

00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:49.935
but now coupled to a
time-dependent rotating field.

00:35:52.770 --> 00:35:54.440
The amplitude of
the rotating field

00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:58.670
is the Rabi frequency
divided by gamma,

00:35:58.670 --> 00:36:09.970
and we assume that the field
is rotating in the xy plane.

00:36:09.970 --> 00:36:18.960
So it's ex ey cosine
omega t sine omega t.

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:22.066
And now I put in two minus
signs here for convenience.

00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:31.180
If you want, I've just shifted--
it's just a definition.

00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:34.250
I've changed the definition of
the amplitude by a minus sign.

00:36:41.130 --> 00:36:53.900
So this is the Rabi frequency,
and the magnetic moment

00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:59.040
divided by gamma is
nothing than the spin.

00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:03.440
Magnetic moment is
gamma times the spin,

00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:19.220
so therefore, we are back
to the spin operators

00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:27.210
and the spin operators,
if I factor out 1/2 H bar,

00:37:27.210 --> 00:37:33.325
are now the Pauli spin
matrices sigma x and sigma y.

00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:48.970
And if you look at
those spin matrices,

00:37:48.970 --> 00:37:54.500
then you'll realize that we
go complex in our Hamiltonian,

00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:58.930
not because we have approximated
a real field cosine omega

00:37:58.930 --> 00:38:03.290
t by some e to the i
omega t, but because when

00:38:03.290 --> 00:38:06.950
we have a rotating field and
we write down it in Pauli spin

00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:12.035
matrices, we get imaginary units
form the sigma y spin matrix.

00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:24.060
So that means we have
now for this system

00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:28.940
rewritten the coupling term took
you to the rotating field H1

00:38:28.940 --> 00:38:38.720
as 0 0 e to the plus i omega
t e to the minus i omega t.

00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:48.720
And therefore,
the Hamiltonian is

00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:54.800
the famous two-level
Hamiltonian with omega naught

00:38:54.800 --> 00:39:02.190
and the Rabi frequency,
which I wrote down

00:39:02.190 --> 00:39:07.660
at the beginning
of this chapter.

00:39:12.270 --> 00:39:21.030
So we'll leave that here, but we
will use it even more in 8.421.

00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:25.810
This is the famous
dressed atom Hamiltonian.

00:39:29.016 --> 00:39:32.590
It is the starting point
to calculate eigenstates

00:39:32.590 --> 00:39:36.960
and eigenvalues, not just
in perturbation theory.

00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:43.550
You can go to oscillating
fields at arbitrary strengths,

00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:47.510
so you can solve exactly in
the dressed atom picture using

00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:51.480
this Hamiltonian, the
problem of a two-level system

00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:54.530
plus one mode of the
electromagnetic field

00:39:54.530 --> 00:39:56.430
no matter what the
drive term, what

00:39:56.430 --> 00:39:58.620
the strengths of the
electromagnetic field

00:39:58.620 --> 00:39:59.610
in the spin mode is.

00:40:04.060 --> 00:40:11.460
So this describes
the two-level system

00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:23.300
plus one mode of the
electromagnetic field

00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:24.870
with arbitrary strengths.

00:40:34.210 --> 00:40:39.350
And as I said, we talk
about some things here

00:40:39.350 --> 00:40:50.500
but others I explored in 8.422.

00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:53.220
Questions?

00:40:53.220 --> 00:40:53.855
Yes, Will.

00:40:53.855 --> 00:40:57.990
AUDIENCE: We refer to the
eigenstates and eigenenergies

00:40:57.990 --> 00:41:01.410
of this Hamiltonian as dressed
in states in the same way

00:41:01.410 --> 00:41:04.924
as we refer to address states
in a fully quantized fiction?

00:41:04.924 --> 00:41:10.492
Do we refer to both
cases as dressed states?

00:41:10.492 --> 00:41:12.360
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:13.460
That's a good question.

00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:16.260
The question is now, what are
the dressed states, and Will,

00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:18.066
I think you are
referring that there

00:41:18.066 --> 00:41:23.480
are two ways to talk about the
coupling of a two-level system

00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:25.570
to one mode of the
electromagnetic field.

00:41:25.570 --> 00:41:28.100
It is this same
classical picture

00:41:28.100 --> 00:41:33.220
where we introduce and let
me say an analog amplitude

00:41:33.220 --> 00:41:35.730
of the electromagnetic
field which drives it.

00:41:35.730 --> 00:41:38.190
And then there is a
fully quantized picture

00:41:38.190 --> 00:41:40.930
where you first quantize
electromagnetic field

00:41:40.930 --> 00:41:44.920
and you couple to
photon number states.

00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:48.110
Actually the beauty of
it that the two solutions

00:41:48.110 --> 00:41:51.060
are exactly the same.

00:41:51.060 --> 00:42:01.490
So in other words, how to
say, if you couple an atom

00:42:01.490 --> 00:42:04.490
to one mode of the
electromagnetic field.

00:42:04.490 --> 00:42:06.780
We have two ways
how we can solve it.

00:42:06.780 --> 00:42:13.860
One is, we introduce a
coherent electromagnetic field,

00:42:13.860 --> 00:42:17.940
and there is an exact unitary
transformation which tells us

00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:21.130
if we have the quantized
field in a coherent state,

00:42:21.130 --> 00:42:23.540
we can do unitary
transformation,

00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:26.490
and what we get is
exactly this Hamiltonian.

00:42:26.490 --> 00:42:29.690
So therefore, this is also--
you may not recognize it--

00:42:29.690 --> 00:42:32.740
this is actually the
quantum description

00:42:32.740 --> 00:42:37.780
of the electromagnetic field
when it is in a coherent state.

00:42:37.780 --> 00:42:41.830
The other option is, we use
the dressed atom picture maybe

00:42:41.830 --> 00:42:45.800
following some work of
[INAUDIBLE] and others

00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:49.320
where we assume this single
mode of electromagnetic field

00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:53.665
has in photons, and
then we solve it

00:42:53.665 --> 00:42:57.450
for this photon number state.

00:42:57.450 --> 00:42:59.860
So in other words,
these are the two ways

00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:02.450
how we can relatively,
easily treat the problem.

00:43:02.450 --> 00:43:05.970
Either we assume the quantum
field is in a coherence state

00:43:05.970 --> 00:43:08.460
or it's in a flux state.

00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:12.090
But since the dressed atom
picture in the standard way

00:43:12.090 --> 00:43:16.270
assumes that the photon
number, N, is large,

00:43:16.270 --> 00:43:19.330
there is a correspondence
that in the limit of N of N

00:43:19.330 --> 00:43:21.840
being large, the flux
state description

00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:24.280
and the coherent state
description fully agree.

00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:30.830
And you pick what you want.

00:43:30.830 --> 00:43:33.240
If you introduce the
electromagnetic field

00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:35.220
explicitly with
it's quantum state,

00:43:35.220 --> 00:43:38.460
you get the dressed atom
picture as a solution of a time

00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:41.550
independent problem, whereas
here with a coherent state

00:43:41.550 --> 00:43:45.380
description, the coherent state
oscillates, cosine omega t,

00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:47.890
with a time-dependent problem.

00:43:47.890 --> 00:43:49.570
And actually I
should say whenever

00:43:49.570 --> 00:43:52.520
I get confused in one picture,
I look in the other picture

00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:55.410
and it becomes clear.

00:43:55.410 --> 00:43:59.510
I generally prefer
where we have N photons,

00:43:59.510 --> 00:44:01.830
it's because we can
discuss everything

00:44:01.830 --> 00:44:06.280
in a time-independent way, but
for certain intuitive aspects,

00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:10.010
this is also variable, so in
the end, you have to learn both.

00:44:10.010 --> 00:44:12.334
And in your homework,
you will actually

00:44:12.334 --> 00:44:14.500
write down the general
solution for this Hamiltonian

00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:17.210
as an exercise.

00:44:17.210 --> 00:44:17.710
Nancy.

00:44:17.710 --> 00:44:21.370
AUDIENCE: I think I'm
confused a little bit.

00:44:21.370 --> 00:44:24.885
So in the flux state
picture, the dressed states

00:44:24.885 --> 00:44:30.115
can be exactly part of an
independent matter of coupling

00:44:30.115 --> 00:44:33.490
between a lesser photon
on any excited state.

00:44:33.490 --> 00:44:38.627
So like we can write eN as 1
and g or something like that.

00:44:38.627 --> 00:44:39.670
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:44:39.670 --> 00:44:42.950
You couple a photon field
with N photons and energy

00:44:42.950 --> 00:44:46.390
in H bar omega to N
minus 1 H bar omega.

00:44:46.390 --> 00:44:51.890
AUDIENCE: But in this one,
is there like a direct photon

00:44:51.890 --> 00:44:54.390
number thing, because we
haven't quantized the field yet?

00:44:54.390 --> 00:44:59.890
So what do the dressed
states mean at this point?

00:44:59.890 --> 00:45:06.320
PROFESSOR: Well, the fact
is that if you start out

00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:10.470
with a coherent state, your
photon field is not in photons,

00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:12.600
it's a laser beam.

00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:15.380
The laser beam or
the coherent state

00:45:15.380 --> 00:45:18.970
is in a quantized description,
a superposition of many flux

00:45:18.970 --> 00:45:20.040
states.

00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:23.850
So therefore, the number of
photons in a coherent state

00:45:23.850 --> 00:45:27.530
fluctuates or has a large
Plutonian statistics,

00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:30.770
and if you take one
photon out or not,

00:45:30.770 --> 00:45:32.260
it doesn't make
a big difference.

00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:34.150
For instance, for
those of you who

00:45:34.150 --> 00:45:38.450
know how the coherent
state is state defined,

00:45:38.450 --> 00:45:42.100
the coherent state
is defined as when

00:45:42.100 --> 00:45:45.630
you act on the coherent state
with an annihilation operator,

00:45:45.630 --> 00:45:48.730
you get the eigenvalue
times the coherent state.

00:45:48.730 --> 00:45:51.350
So that tells you you have a
fully-quantized description

00:45:51.350 --> 00:45:54.100
of your laser in terms
of a coherent state.

00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:56.530
You take one photon
out and what you get?

00:45:56.530 --> 00:45:58.100
the same state back.

00:45:58.100 --> 00:46:01.910
And this may immediately justify
that what we write down here

00:46:01.910 --> 00:46:05.295
is simply the coherent
state with its amplitude

00:46:05.295 --> 00:46:06.920
and the amplitude of
the coherent state

00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:10.420
would be B1, the amplitude
of the drive field.

00:46:10.420 --> 00:46:12.450
And we don't really
need other states

00:46:12.450 --> 00:46:14.360
because a coherent
state has the property.

00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:17.462
You to take a photon out and
you still have the same state.

00:46:17.462 --> 00:46:18.920
So therefore, we
don't have to keep

00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:20.410
track of the coherent state.

00:46:20.410 --> 00:46:23.500
It's there all the time.

00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:25.580
But what I'm saying
can be formulated

00:46:25.580 --> 00:46:28.949
more exactly when we use
the appropriate formulas.

00:46:28.949 --> 00:46:30.240
But this is sort of the bridge.

00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:33.570
That's why we do not have to
keep track of the photon state.

00:46:33.570 --> 00:46:38.754
It's because the coherent state
has those wonderful properties.

00:46:38.754 --> 00:46:39.420
Other questions?

00:46:44.710 --> 00:46:47.149
OK.

00:46:47.149 --> 00:46:48.565
So this is the
famous Hamiltonian.

00:46:52.420 --> 00:46:55.450
And of course, if it's
the famous Hamiltonian,

00:46:55.450 --> 00:46:58.070
we want to solve it.

00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:13.520
As I said, the general solution
is left to the homework,

00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:16.710
but I want to sort
of show you parts

00:47:16.710 --> 00:47:19.190
of the solution to tell a story.

00:47:19.190 --> 00:47:22.550
And the question is, well, how
do we solve this Hamiltonian?

00:47:25.100 --> 00:47:27.690
The answer is, we
do exactly what we

00:47:27.690 --> 00:47:29.670
did in the classical problem.

00:47:29.670 --> 00:47:33.000
We transform to
the rotating frame.

00:47:38.090 --> 00:47:41.960
In other words, this
Hamiltonian is best

00:47:41.960 --> 00:47:48.150
solved by doing-- you can
actually solve it directly.

00:47:48.150 --> 00:47:51.040
You can just put in a tri
wave function and solve it.

00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:55.360
But I want to sort of
bring out the big idea here

00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:57.920
which is analogous
to what we have done

00:47:57.920 --> 00:47:59.950
in the last few
classes, namely we

00:47:59.950 --> 00:48:03.180
have involved rotating frames.

00:48:03.180 --> 00:48:09.570
So what solves this Hamiltonian
is a unitary transformation,

00:48:09.570 --> 00:48:17.040
and the unitary
transformation is this one.

00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:32.402
And so this unitary
transformation,

00:48:32.402 --> 00:48:37.710
let me first write it down,
it transforms the Hamiltonian

00:48:37.710 --> 00:48:44.250
to the time independent one.

00:48:44.250 --> 00:48:48.010
We have now time independent
of diagonal matrix elements.

00:48:52.260 --> 00:48:56.100
Our diagonal matrix
element have changed.

00:48:56.100 --> 00:49:02.030
Delta is now the detuning of the
tri frequency from the energy

00:49:02.030 --> 00:49:04.440
splitting of the
two-level system.

00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:07.340
In particular, when
we are on resonance,

00:49:07.340 --> 00:49:09.880
the diagonal matrix
elements have disappeared.

00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:21.460
This is the result of the
unitary transformation,

00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:30.240
and let me just show you this
transformation over here.

00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:37.730
Can be actually written
as an operator involving

00:49:37.730 --> 00:49:42.620
the z component of
the magnetic field.

00:49:42.620 --> 00:49:45.770
And what I just wrote
down for you is actually

00:49:45.770 --> 00:49:48.930
the quantum mechanical
operator, the rotation

00:49:48.930 --> 00:49:57.295
operator for performing at
rotation around the z-axis.

00:50:00.300 --> 00:50:06.070
So by selecting the rotation
angle to be omega t,

00:50:06.070 --> 00:50:10.290
that's how I can generate
the unitary transformation,

00:50:10.290 --> 00:50:16.201
and this unitary transformation
makes the Hamiltonian time

00:50:16.201 --> 00:50:16.700
independent.

00:50:23.180 --> 00:50:26.510
So in other words, everything
is in the classical system.

00:50:26.510 --> 00:50:29.262
We just go to a frame which
rotates with a [INAUDIBLE],

00:50:29.262 --> 00:50:30.970
and we find the
time-independent problem.

00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:46.470
So now this Hamiltonian
can be easily solved.

00:50:55.470 --> 00:51:00.020
And you will find
as a special case

00:51:00.020 --> 00:51:02.750
when you start
with an amplitude,

00:51:02.750 --> 00:51:05.510
initially you start
in the ground state,

00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:10.580
then the excited
state amplitude square

00:51:10.580 --> 00:51:17.750
is the Rabi
oscillation, something

00:51:17.750 --> 00:51:32.140
we discussed 40 minutes
ago, but before, we

00:51:32.140 --> 00:51:33.810
got it from the
classical quantum

00:51:33.810 --> 00:51:36.430
mechanical correspondence
using the Heisenberg equation

00:51:36.430 --> 00:51:41.600
of motion and here it comes
out by explicitly solving

00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:44.518
for the wave function for
the dressed Hamiltonian.

00:51:56.021 --> 00:51:56.520
Questions?

00:52:13.550 --> 00:52:26.370
I want to say a few words now
about rapid adiabatic passage,

00:52:26.370 --> 00:52:31.700
but this time by emphasizing
the quantum mechanical aspects.

00:52:36.910 --> 00:52:42.079
In other words, we have
a clear understanding

00:52:42.079 --> 00:52:43.120
what happens classically.

00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:45.070
We have a clear
understanding what

00:52:45.070 --> 00:52:48.070
happens in the adiabatic
limit, but I just

00:52:48.070 --> 00:52:50.670
want to sort of in
the next 10 minutes

00:52:50.670 --> 00:52:52.870
use what we have
already learned,

00:52:52.870 --> 00:52:56.210
combine it with the quantum
mechanical Hamiltonian

00:52:56.210 --> 00:53:00.950
and tell you that, well, when
you are not fully adiabatic,

00:53:00.950 --> 00:53:04.130
you actually have transition
probabilities between the two

00:53:04.130 --> 00:53:05.160
states.

00:53:05.160 --> 00:53:11.530
So I want to sort of bring
in the concept of transition

00:53:11.530 --> 00:53:19.040
probabilities to
the case of-- what

00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:21.362
I want to say is rapid
adiabatic passage when it's

00:53:21.362 --> 00:53:23.820
no longer adiabatic, but what
this just means when we sweep

00:53:23.820 --> 00:53:28.080
the frequency and we're
not in the adiabatic limit.

00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:35.400
So how do we describe
it quantum mechanically?

00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:46.076
We start out with a Hamiltonian,
which has-- we use our rotating

00:53:46.076 --> 00:53:49.510
framework for convenience
that allows to write down

00:53:49.510 --> 00:53:56.330
exactly the same Hamiltonian
in time-independent picture.

00:53:56.330 --> 00:54:03.680
So the Hamiltonian has
two parts, a diagonal part

00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:09.330
and an off-diagonal part.

00:54:14.350 --> 00:54:24.930
So if I show the energy as a
function of detuning delta--

00:54:24.930 --> 00:54:29.095
well, maybe I should
times 2 over H bar,

00:54:29.095 --> 00:54:35.190
just normalize it so then it
becomes just the straight line

00:54:35.190 --> 00:54:38.150
at 45 degree y equals x.

00:54:38.150 --> 00:54:48.530
So the unperturbed-- the
Hamiltonian without drive

00:54:48.530 --> 00:54:52.455
has a level crossing
at detuning 0.

00:54:55.770 --> 00:54:58.808
Then we add to it
the drive term.

00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:09.140
Well, let me just
write down, not

00:55:09.140 --> 00:55:15.950
the drive term but
the full Hamiltonian.

00:55:15.950 --> 00:55:20.280
So the full Hamiltonian with
the addition of the drive term

00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:23.530
has delta minus
delta and now it has

00:55:23.530 --> 00:55:27.370
the coupling with
the Rabi frequency.

00:55:27.370 --> 00:55:31.660
That means that on resonance,
the degeneracy between the two

00:55:31.660 --> 00:55:35.840
levels is split by
the Rabi frequency,

00:55:35.840 --> 00:55:38.200
and if I now show
you the energy eigen

00:55:38.200 --> 00:55:42.580
levels of this
two-by-two Hamiltonian,

00:55:42.580 --> 00:55:47.650
it will asymptotically
coincide with a dashed line

00:55:47.650 --> 00:55:51.130
through this and through that.

00:55:54.090 --> 00:55:57.440
So in other words,
I'm just reminding you

00:55:57.440 --> 00:56:02.250
that a non-diagonal matrix
element turns a crossing

00:56:02.250 --> 00:56:03.520
into an avoided crossing.

00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:18.800
So when we take
the frequency omega

00:56:18.800 --> 00:56:27.120
and we sweep the detuning,
so we change delta

00:56:27.120 --> 00:56:36.790
and do a sweep of the frequency
omega at a rate omega dot,

00:56:36.790 --> 00:56:40.960
then we sweep through the
resonance and in one limit,

00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:46.470
we have rapid adiabatic
passage or in general, we

00:56:46.470 --> 00:56:49.850
realize the Landau-Zener
problem of a sweep

00:56:49.850 --> 00:56:52.970
through an avoided crossing.

00:56:52.970 --> 00:56:56.010
So what I'm formulating
here is it's

00:56:56.010 --> 00:56:58.670
the so-called
Landau-Zener crossing

00:56:58.670 --> 00:57:01.480
or the Landau-Zener
problem, which

00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:07.430
is the quantum mechanical
description of you take

00:57:07.430 --> 00:57:12.370
a system by changing
an external parameter.

00:57:12.370 --> 00:57:17.300
Here, we sweep the frequency
of the rotating field,

00:57:17.300 --> 00:57:20.310
but by changing the
external parameter,

00:57:20.310 --> 00:57:24.418
we sweep the system through
the avoided crossing.

00:57:33.880 --> 00:57:36.600
And it has the
two limiting cases

00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:41.620
that when we go through this
crossing very, very slowly,

00:57:41.620 --> 00:57:44.640
the adiabatic field
then tells us we

00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:48.590
stay on one of these
adiabatic solid curves,

00:57:48.590 --> 00:57:51.850
and this is the case of rapid
adiabatic passage, which

00:57:51.850 --> 00:57:54.350
we discuss in the
classical limit.

00:57:54.350 --> 00:57:57.090
But it is also
the other solution

00:57:57.090 --> 00:58:00.510
if you would sweep through
it very, very fast,

00:58:00.510 --> 00:58:03.830
you're in the diabatic limit,
you follow the dashed line

00:58:03.830 --> 00:58:06.654
and you start up here
and you wind up there.

00:58:15.810 --> 00:58:17.310
The Landau-Zener
problem is actually

00:58:17.310 --> 00:58:20.790
a problem which you find
it in all it text books,

00:58:20.790 --> 00:58:22.590
but to the best of
my knowledge, there

00:58:22.590 --> 00:58:25.580
is no simple,
elementary derivation

00:58:25.580 --> 00:58:27.480
which I could give
you in a few minutes.

00:58:27.480 --> 00:58:29.750
And if the
mathematical problem is

00:58:29.750 --> 00:58:34.720
a nice, mathematical
demonstration

00:58:34.720 --> 00:58:41.430
of an exact, solvable model,
but to my knowledge explicitly

00:58:41.430 --> 00:58:43.940
deriving it is not providing
additional insight.

00:58:43.940 --> 00:58:47.260
It's one of the cases
where the result is

00:58:47.260 --> 00:58:51.210
more insightful and much
simpler than the derivation.

00:58:51.210 --> 00:58:53.180
So what I want to give
you is, therefore,

00:58:53.180 --> 00:58:54.540
simply the textbook result.

00:59:00.650 --> 00:59:05.590
So in the adiabatic limit,
you stay on the solid line.

00:59:05.590 --> 00:59:12.390
If you do not cross the avoided
crossing very, very slowly,

00:59:12.390 --> 00:59:16.610
you'll have a
non-adiabatic probability

00:59:16.610 --> 00:59:21.080
to jump from one level
to the other one.

00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:26.660
And this non-adiabatic
probability

00:59:26.660 --> 00:59:32.360
is expressed as an
exponential function which

00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:35.680
involves the
Landau-Zener parameter.

00:59:35.680 --> 00:59:46.290
And the Landau-Zener parameter
in this exact solution

00:59:46.290 --> 00:59:56.070
is omega Rabi squared times
this new rate, d omega

00:59:56.070 --> 01:00:00.048
dt or d delta dt minus 1.

01:00:04.780 --> 01:00:08.070
This square should go
outside the brackets,

01:00:08.070 --> 01:00:11.200
so therefore, what we find
is from the exact solution

01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:16.190
that the Landau-Zener
parameter is a quarter times--

01:00:16.190 --> 01:00:20.175
and this should
now look familiar,

01:00:20.175 --> 01:00:22.890
the omega Ravi frequencies
squared over omega dot.

01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:30.610
And when we discussed the limit
of adiabaticity classically,

01:00:30.610 --> 01:00:33.910
I hope you remember I gave
you the argument by looking

01:00:33.910 --> 01:00:39.520
at the adiabatic condition that
the adiabatic case requires

01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:43.090
omega dot to be much smaller
than omega Rabi squared.

01:00:43.090 --> 01:00:46.050
So here very naturally
what appears in the quantum

01:00:46.050 --> 01:00:49.500
mechanical problem is just the
ratio of the two quantities

01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:54.930
we compared when we looked
for the limit of adiabaticity.

01:00:54.930 --> 01:01:03.980
So therefore, the probability
for a non-adiabatic transition

01:01:03.980 --> 01:01:08.525
is simply involving this
ratio omega Rabi squared

01:01:08.525 --> 01:01:09.830
over omega dot.

01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:17.780
So in other words,
we know already

01:01:17.780 --> 01:01:19.530
from the classical
argument, but here we

01:01:19.530 --> 01:01:29.657
confirm it, adiabaticity require
that this inequality is met.

01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:52.300
OK, I could stop
here, but since we

01:01:52.300 --> 01:01:59.220
are using sort of diabatic
sweeps in the laboratory,

01:01:59.220 --> 01:02:03.950
as long as I've been involved
in doing quote "atom science,"

01:02:03.950 --> 01:02:09.330
I want to sort of go one
step further and teach you

01:02:09.330 --> 01:02:11.440
a little bit more
about this formula

01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:14.970
and try to provide
insight, and often

01:02:14.970 --> 01:02:19.120
insight is also provided when
you apply perturbation theory.

01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:22.120
So I know the adiabatic
case is very simple,

01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:24.830
but I want to look
at the diabatic case

01:02:24.830 --> 01:02:27.620
and then look at
transition probabilities

01:02:27.620 --> 01:02:29.240
in a perturbative way.

01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:34.100
This is actually the way how
we often transfer population

01:02:34.100 --> 01:02:34.850
in the laboratory.

01:02:42.870 --> 01:02:48.030
So I want to understand
better the way how we transfer

01:02:48.030 --> 01:02:52.000
population from one
curve to the other one.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:57.040
So if we do a fast sweep,
we call it diabatic.

01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:10.240
So in other words, if
we have this crossing

01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:15.740
and we go really fast,
well, what happens

01:03:15.740 --> 01:03:19.100
is this is the crossing
between spin up and spin down.

01:03:19.100 --> 01:03:22.160
If you go much, much faster
than the Rabi frequency,

01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:27.050
the spin has no opportunity
to change its orientation.

01:03:27.050 --> 01:03:33.130
So therefore, the wave function,
the spin has to stay up or down

01:03:33.130 --> 01:03:36.015
and that means the
system just goes straight

01:03:36.015 --> 01:03:37.800
through the crossing.

01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:41.790
Because spin up has
positive slopes,

01:03:41.790 --> 01:03:43.830
spin down has negative slope.

01:03:43.830 --> 01:03:48.360
Being adiabatic, staying on
this lower adiabatic curve

01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:50.460
would actually
require the system

01:03:50.460 --> 01:03:54.160
to go from spin up in this
part of the adiabatic curve

01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:56.600
to spin down in the other part.

01:03:56.600 --> 01:04:00.120
And to flip a spin cannot
be done faster than the Rabi

01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:05.430
frequency, so if you sweep
fast, that's what's happening.

01:04:05.430 --> 01:04:08.830
So we have two trivial limits,
one is the adiabatic limit

01:04:08.830 --> 01:04:11.770
or just the adiabatic
curve and nothing happens.

01:04:11.770 --> 01:04:14.660
The other limit is the
infinitely-fast limit

01:04:14.660 --> 01:04:17.380
and nothing happens
again when we

01:04:17.380 --> 01:04:21.170
look at the diabatic basis,
which is spin up and spin down.

01:04:21.170 --> 01:04:28.270
But now let's be
almost adiabatic,

01:04:28.270 --> 01:04:30.080
and this is a problem
which we really

01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:34.330
want to understand physically
and intuitively because that

01:04:34.330 --> 01:04:40.530
means the system spins the
small timelier resonance,

01:04:40.530 --> 01:04:51.036
and there is a small probability
to make a transition.

01:04:56.880 --> 01:04:58.960
So if you had one of
your hyperfine states,

01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:01.140
pick your favorite
hyperfine state,

01:05:01.140 --> 01:05:03.230
you'll rapidly
sweep the frequency.

01:05:03.230 --> 01:05:06.650
You will find, unless you
sweep it infinitely fast

01:05:06.650 --> 01:05:10.220
that there's a small probability
in the other hyperfine state.

01:05:10.220 --> 01:05:12.280
And that's what you
want to calculate now,

01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:15.220
and I want you to
understand how would you

01:05:15.220 --> 01:05:17.390
estimate and calculate
the small probability.

01:05:23.390 --> 01:05:33.230
So let's now estimate
the result, namely

01:05:33.230 --> 01:05:35.670
for the small probability
in perturbation theory.

01:05:43.820 --> 01:05:47.750
And actually what I'm
calculating for you here is,

01:05:47.750 --> 01:05:50.110
if you've used evaporation--
I know half of the class

01:05:50.110 --> 01:05:53.170
is doing that-- if you
apply an i F field,

01:05:53.170 --> 01:05:54.630
you don't have to
make it so strong

01:05:54.630 --> 01:05:56.150
that you and the
adiabatic limit.

01:05:56.150 --> 01:05:57.920
You are exactly in this limit.

01:05:57.920 --> 01:06:00.900
The atom will
slosh several times

01:06:00.900 --> 01:06:04.160
through the resonance in
an almost diabatic way,

01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:06.840
but there is a finite
spin flip probability

01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:09.160
and that's how you
evaporate atoms.

01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:11.630
And I want you now
to fully understand

01:06:11.630 --> 01:06:15.750
the derivation, what is the
probability of ejecting atoms

01:06:15.750 --> 01:06:19.570
in the almost diabatic
limit with i F spin flips.

01:06:19.570 --> 01:06:24.520
That's a limit where 90% of
the BEC experiments operate.

01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:30.640
So I hope everyone realize
it's an important question

01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:32.290
and also I hope
everybody understands

01:06:32.290 --> 01:06:36.450
the question because now I
have bigger questions for you.

01:06:36.450 --> 01:06:40.250
The first question
which I will ask you,

01:06:40.250 --> 01:06:48.460
should we calculate that
transition probability

01:06:48.460 --> 01:06:54.020
by using perturbation theory
for an incoherent transition

01:06:54.020 --> 01:06:56.490
or for coherent transition?

01:06:56.490 --> 01:06:59.150
Let me just explain you
what I mean and then I

01:06:59.150 --> 01:07:01.860
ask you for your opinion.

01:07:01.860 --> 01:07:05.700
Coherently, we simply say
in perturbation theory,

01:07:05.700 --> 01:07:10.860
we start with our
population in state 1.

01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:14.910
We have to do the
coupling Hamiltonian time

01:07:14.910 --> 01:07:18.300
dependence of the
population in state 2

01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:26.000
and that means if we integrate
this equation for a short time,

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:29.060
we find an amplitude a2.

01:07:29.060 --> 01:07:31.400
And the probability
to be in the state

01:07:31.400 --> 01:07:35.140
2, which is the
amplitude squared,

01:07:35.140 --> 01:07:38.860
is proportional to the
Rabi frequency squared

01:07:38.860 --> 01:07:41.370
times the effective
time squared,

01:07:41.370 --> 01:07:45.320
the effective time of
tribing the system.

01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:48.160
Coherent processes are
always quadratic in time.

01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:55.610
If we do it incoherently,
well, the way

01:07:55.610 --> 01:07:57.860
how we describe
incoherent processes

01:07:57.860 --> 01:08:03.450
are Fermi's golden rule,
which we've all seen.

01:08:03.450 --> 01:08:12.510
And the probability in Fermi's
golden rule is very different.

01:08:12.510 --> 01:08:15.600
Well, it is proportional to
the Rabi frequency squared,

01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:18.250
to the matrix element squared,
but Fermi's golden rule

01:08:18.250 --> 01:08:22.340
gives us a constant rate,
and for constant rate,

01:08:22.340 --> 01:08:25.180
the probability is
rate times time.

01:08:25.180 --> 01:08:30.660
So now it is linear
in time and then

01:08:30.660 --> 01:08:37.290
because of the delta function
in Fermi's golden rule--

01:08:37.290 --> 01:08:40.890
I'm missing a symbol
so I use gamma here.

01:08:40.890 --> 01:08:43.540
It has nothing to do with
the Landau-Zener probability.

01:08:43.540 --> 01:08:45.534
This is just the
density of states.

01:08:49.890 --> 01:08:51.899
So I hope you know now
what is the difference

01:08:51.899 --> 01:08:54.109
between coherent or incoherent.

01:08:54.109 --> 01:08:57.979
The most important
part is that things

01:08:57.979 --> 01:09:01.014
are linear in time for an
incoherent pulses rate equation

01:09:01.014 --> 01:09:03.897
and at least for small
times quadratic in time

01:09:03.897 --> 01:09:04.730
for coherent pulses.

01:09:08.290 --> 01:09:15.330
So now we come to
this process where

01:09:15.330 --> 01:09:20.470
we take atoms from
spin up to spin down.

01:09:20.470 --> 01:09:25.750
We evaporate with a weak,
course, almost adiabatic

01:09:25.750 --> 01:09:29.560
with weaker f drive, so we are
closer to the diabatic limit.

01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:33.670
And so if you think
about this problem,

01:09:33.670 --> 01:09:41.590
I want you to tell
me if this process,

01:09:41.590 --> 01:09:47.170
the perturbative transition
close to the diabatic case

01:09:47.170 --> 01:09:51.399
is that should we use
when we apply perturbation

01:09:51.399 --> 01:10:03.810
theory, the coherent picture
or the incoherent picture.

01:10:03.810 --> 01:10:07.450
In other words, is the dynamics
of the quantum system, when

01:10:07.450 --> 01:10:13.855
we go relatively quickly for
the Landau-Zener crossing,

01:10:13.855 --> 01:10:16.630
is that a coherent or
an incoherent process?

01:10:24.250 --> 01:10:27.217
I could see where it doesn't
matter, but it does matter.

01:10:36.970 --> 01:10:40.656
So I think it's
an open question.

01:10:40.656 --> 01:10:41.780
Let me give you the answer.

01:10:44.370 --> 01:10:47.940
It is coherent, and you can
see it in the following way.

01:10:47.940 --> 01:10:50.736
What is the source
of incoherent here?

01:10:50.736 --> 01:10:52.710
We have a Hamiltonian.

01:10:52.710 --> 01:10:55.520
The Hilbert space
is by two-by-two.

01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:58.470
There is no coherence
which can be lost.

01:10:58.470 --> 01:11:01.700
There is no spontaneous
emission to other states.

01:11:01.700 --> 01:11:04.000
There is no reservoir.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.510
We don't have a small system
which couples to a bigger

01:11:06.510 --> 01:11:08.810
system, and then
the small system--

01:11:08.810 --> 01:11:12.680
we do that on Wednesday--
has to-- tomorrow,

01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:15.500
Wednesday-- has to be
described by density matrix.

01:11:15.500 --> 01:11:17.670
We have the none of
the physics which

01:11:17.670 --> 01:11:20.010
would give arise to
incoherent physics.

01:11:20.010 --> 01:11:20.900
It is coherent.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:26.690
But maybe I'm oversimplifying.

01:11:26.690 --> 01:11:29.140
Is somebody who
said it's incoherent

01:11:29.140 --> 01:11:31.959
who wants to maybe press
me harder and tell me

01:11:31.959 --> 01:11:33.250
why you think it is incoherent.

01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:41.770
Well, one possibility
is-- and this

01:11:41.770 --> 01:11:44.600
is why we often use
Landau-Zener sweeps in the lab.

01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:47.570
We have fluctuations of
the resonance frequency.

01:11:47.570 --> 01:11:50.004
And when we go and
sweep through it,

01:11:50.004 --> 01:11:53.400
we don't know exactly
when we hit the resonance.

01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:56.060
And if you would take
an ensemble of systems

01:11:56.060 --> 01:11:59.020
and you go through the
resonance at different times,

01:11:59.020 --> 01:12:01.640
you will get an ensemble
of wave functions, which

01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:04.860
has different phase factors
in it, and in the end,

01:12:04.860 --> 01:12:08.530
you will actually need a
density matrix to describe it.

01:12:08.530 --> 01:12:10.860
But this is now an
experimental imperfection

01:12:10.860 --> 01:12:13.200
which I haven't assumed here.

01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:16.070
So in other words, what you
should do is the following.

01:12:16.070 --> 01:12:18.660
Whenever you sweep through
Landau-Zener crossing,

01:12:18.660 --> 01:12:21.120
you start with the ground
state and what you get out

01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:23.890
is a superposition of
ground and excited state.

01:12:23.890 --> 01:12:28.720
And the Hamiltonian determines
absolutely every aspect

01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:31.890
of the amplitude in the ground
and the excited state including

01:12:31.890 --> 01:12:33.480
all phase factors.

01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:37.965
In other words, if you do a
Landau-Zener crossing in a way

01:12:37.965 --> 01:12:40.720
that you prepare
50-50% of the atoms,

01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:45.270
they are always face coherent
and you can use this process

01:12:45.270 --> 01:12:48.250
as a beam splitter in
an atomic thermometer.

01:12:48.250 --> 01:12:49.170
Fully coherent.

01:12:56.230 --> 01:13:09.470
We have five minutes,
so if we assume now,

01:13:09.470 --> 01:13:15.770
I hope we all agree that
the amplitude is obtained

01:13:15.770 --> 01:13:19.640
in this coherent wave, then,
of course, the question is,

01:13:19.640 --> 01:13:22.450
but what is the effective time?

01:13:22.450 --> 01:13:25.414
When we sweep the
resonance, we are far away.

01:13:25.414 --> 01:13:26.080
Nothing happens.

01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:26.820
Nothing happens.

01:13:26.820 --> 01:13:28.010
Nothing happens.

01:13:28.010 --> 01:13:30.620
We go through the resonance,
everything happens.

01:13:30.620 --> 01:13:31.300
Nothing happens.

01:13:31.300 --> 01:13:31.966
Nothing happens.

01:13:31.966 --> 01:13:32.760
Nothing happens.

01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:36.930
So this is the effective time
when the wave function really

01:13:36.930 --> 01:13:39.660
changes and we create
the coherent and mixture

01:13:39.660 --> 01:13:42.030
in the second state.

01:13:42.030 --> 01:13:45.170
And it is this
effective times squared

01:13:45.170 --> 01:13:51.670
which determines what
happens, what our transmission

01:13:51.670 --> 01:13:53.830
amplitude is.

01:13:53.830 --> 01:13:59.480
So therefore, the
question is, what

01:13:59.480 --> 01:14:02.170
is the effective time in
the Landau-Zener crossing?

01:14:04.940 --> 01:14:08.630
I can give you three choices.

01:14:08.630 --> 01:14:15.900
One is, the effective time
is, well, we change omega

01:14:15.900 --> 01:14:20.270
and the effective time
is, how long, what

01:14:20.270 --> 01:14:23.490
is the time until we
have a detuning, which

01:14:23.490 --> 01:14:25.200
is equal to the Rabi frequency.

01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:32.870
Another possibility is that
the effective time where

01:14:32.870 --> 01:14:35.320
we coherently
drive the system is

01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:39.370
1 over the Rabi frequency,
just the Rabi period.

01:14:39.370 --> 01:14:44.365
Or another choice, how
I can construct time out

01:14:44.365 --> 01:14:50.240
of the two frequencies where
it's omega Rabi and omega dot.

01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:52.010
These are our two elements.

01:14:52.010 --> 01:14:55.890
So another possibility
how I can get time

01:14:55.890 --> 01:15:00.680
is, omega dot is
frequency squared,

01:15:00.680 --> 01:15:04.290
and the square root of 1
over omega dot at least

01:15:04.290 --> 01:15:09.040
fulfills the dimensional
criterion that this is time.

01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:13.640
So my question for you
is, what do you think

01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:15.610
is the effective
time during which

01:15:15.610 --> 01:15:19.230
we drive the system coherently?

01:15:19.230 --> 01:15:22.360
I have to tell you before
I made up the problem,

01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:24.550
I do not know the answer.

01:15:24.550 --> 01:15:26.720
But I can also
tell you that there

01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:28.490
is only one answer
which is correct.

01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:37.600
All right.

01:15:45.080 --> 01:15:52.110
I have to say I expected A
to be the correct answer,

01:15:52.110 --> 01:15:56.040
but I convinced
myself it's only B.

01:15:56.040 --> 01:16:02.600
And the answer is the following,
and I know I have to stop,

01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:04.880
but I only need
three more lines.

01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:09.300
The effective time is not the
time until you are detuned,

01:16:09.300 --> 01:16:14.770
the effective time is which
I can call the dephasing

01:16:14.770 --> 01:16:21.600
time, the time during which
everything is coherent.

01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:29.110
What happens is, we change
the frequency delta omega,

01:16:29.110 --> 01:16:33.810
and the delta omega
is, of course,

01:16:33.810 --> 01:16:37.610
omega dot times delta t.

01:16:37.610 --> 01:16:42.050
So if we change the frequency
by sweeping it in such a way

01:16:42.050 --> 01:16:46.120
that we are detuning and
now with that detuning,

01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:50.950
if we let the system evolve, we
would get a phase shift of pi.

01:16:50.950 --> 01:16:55.630
That's sort of the maximum where
everything adds up coherently.

01:16:55.630 --> 01:16:58.560
If we would go longer
in time, the frequency

01:16:58.560 --> 01:17:00.660
has changed to the
point that what

01:17:00.660 --> 01:17:05.460
we add to the amplitude
of the other state

01:17:05.460 --> 01:17:09.266
is no longer in phase to
what we have added before.

01:17:09.266 --> 01:17:10.960
You can sort of look
at it like this.

01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:12.999
You have a little bit of
phase a2, You build up.

01:17:12.999 --> 01:17:13.540
You build up.

01:17:13.540 --> 01:17:16.600
You build up by adding
amplitude with the same phase.

01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:18.290
But now you are
sweeping, and this

01:17:18.290 --> 01:17:23.720
is the criterion where
you start to pile up

01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:25.220
things with the
wrong phase and then

01:17:25.220 --> 01:17:26.904
the phase eventually
becomes randomized

01:17:26.904 --> 01:17:28.570
and you're not
effectively contributing.

01:17:32.580 --> 01:17:35.970
This equation defines
the window delta

01:17:35.970 --> 01:17:41.180
t during which we effectively
add substantial amplitude

01:17:41.180 --> 01:17:45.550
in the second state, and it
involves delta t squared,

01:17:45.550 --> 01:17:49.335
so neglecting factors of
unity, the result of this

01:17:49.335 --> 01:17:58.640
is that, indeed, delta t
is 1 over omega dot plus.

01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:04.630
And indeed, if we say the
probability for coherent drive

01:18:04.630 --> 01:18:10.150
is Rabi frequency squared times
delta t squared, what we now

01:18:10.150 --> 01:18:15.480
obtain is the Rabi frequency
squared over omega dot,

01:18:15.480 --> 01:18:19.560
and this is our
Landau-Zener parameter.

01:18:19.560 --> 01:18:33.240
So in other words, if we
check with the exact result,

01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:41.040
the Landau-Zener probability,
1 minus p non-adiabatic--

01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:44.240
the Landau-Zener problem
is e to the minus 2 pi

01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:46.900
over gamma or gamma pi over
2 over the Landau-Zener

01:18:46.900 --> 01:18:51.980
parameter, if I do an expansion
of the Landau-Zener parameter

01:18:51.980 --> 01:18:54.880
for a small value
of the exponent,

01:18:54.880 --> 01:18:59.950
the exact result is
2 pi times gamma,

01:18:59.950 --> 01:19:03.880
and this is indeed proportional
to omega Rabi squared

01:19:03.880 --> 01:19:05.870
over omega dot.

01:19:05.870 --> 01:19:07.590
So in other words,
what I've shown

01:19:07.590 --> 01:19:10.510
you is that coherent
time evolution

01:19:10.510 --> 01:19:15.590
with this weird effective time,
what I motivated physically,

01:19:15.590 --> 01:19:18.580
exactly that produce
the limit of small gamma

01:19:18.580 --> 01:19:20.790
from the exact result for
the Landau-Zener crossing.

01:19:23.420 --> 01:19:24.870
OK.

01:19:24.870 --> 01:19:25.930
I know time is over.

01:19:25.930 --> 01:19:26.810
Any questions?

01:19:30.130 --> 01:19:30.630
OK.

01:19:30.630 --> 01:19:33.650
So today was officially
our Monday class,

01:19:33.650 --> 01:19:38.514
so we meet again tomorrow,
the same place, the same time.
