00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.480
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.570
Here is the menu for today.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.510
We're discussing line
shifts and line broadening.

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.700
And I want to finish
up today this chapter

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.470
by describing collisional
narrowing, also called

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.100
Dicke narrowing.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.090
Then I want to have
two more shorter topics

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:49.310
on two other aspects which
lead to important line shapes

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:50.600
and line broadening.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.600
So I want to quickly discuss
the spectrum of emitted light

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.550
by an atom.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.210
And I want to discuss
collisional broadening.

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.070
None of that will
be done in-depth.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.330
The spectrum of emitted
light is really open-ended,

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.780
and we will have a more
advanced treatment in 8.422.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.650
But I do feel if I show you
all are kinds of line shifts

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.830
and line broadening,
I should at least

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.390
mention here the basic things.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.940
And collisional
broadening, I'm not

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.680
sure how many atomic
physics courses

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.910
you will find which teach
about collision broadening,

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:26.210
because this is the physics
from gas discharge lamps,

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.740
the old-fashioned physics.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.670
However, I've realized
that a lot of people

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.150
know now about clock shifts,
and mean field broadening,

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.400
and mean field, and
the ultra-cold gases.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.310
And they have no idea that
similar physics actually

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.950
happens in ordinary gas.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.280
So at least in terms of
broadening your understanding,

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.050
I want to talk just 10 minutes
about collisional broadening.

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.560
I've completely eliminated
from this course

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.580
the quantitative description
about collisional broadening,

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.330
but I want to show
you a few cartoons

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.910
and put some pictures
into your mind.

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.630
And probably, we have time to
start the next chapter, which

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.490
is actually a pretty short
one, on two-photon transitions.

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:11.720
For me, actually,
Dicke narrowing

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.620
is really the highlight
of the course,

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.900
because it provides
conceptual insight

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.840
into what really
line broadening is,

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.820
and to realize that collisions
can narrow lines and not

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.530
just broaden them.

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.910
This is sort of
subtle and insightful.

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.470
And similar to photon
transitions, it's short,

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.300
but I hope it's also a
highlight, because there's

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.770
so many people-- you and other
people-- who are sometimes

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.140
struggling-- a photon is
absorbed and is emitted.

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.710
Usually, the photon
is not absorbed,

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:46.090
the photon is scattered.

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.280
And whenever you think
about photon in, photon out,

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.810
you really should think
about two-photon transitions.

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.280
So the framework of
two-photon transitions

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.050
allows me now to give you the
tools how you should really

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.869
think about whenever you have
atoms interacting with light.

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:05.160
The light is not absorbed,
the light is just scattered.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.480
And so you need that.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.350
On the other hand, based
on all the descriptions

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.700
I've given you about
light-atom interaction,

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.120
two-photon
transitions would just

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.610
mean we need one more order
of perturbation theory,

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.060
and then it's the same thing
you have already learned.

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.850
So it's a highlight, and it's
to some extent also a review.

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.990
You will actually recognize, in
some situations, the difference

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:28.720
between two-photon processes
and one-photon processes.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.990
It's not so big, it's just
you have to-- you'll see.

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:34.150
You have to use a
different Rabi frequency

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.930
and some different concepts.

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:37.780
OK.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.880
So that's, I think, really
an agenda of highlights.

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:48.120
Let's go back to the physical
picture we drew up on Wednesday

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.780
about Dicke narrowing.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.310
I just explained
to you that when

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.900
we have an atom which is
trapped and tightly confined,

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.470
that the spectrum consists of
a sharp light and sidebands.

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.660
And now I was addressing
the situation--

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.370
what happens if you
have an atom which

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:09.520
is surrounded by buffer gas?

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:14.270
I would say, well, that's a
cheap trap created by nature,

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:16.350
because when the particle
wants to fly away,

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.390
it collides with
a buffer gas atom.

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.490
So it stays put.

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:23.790
So it's a cheap trap, but
it's also a lousy trap,

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.070
because there is some randomness
in the number of collisions.

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.910
But I'm waving my
arm, so that maybe you

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.050
can go along with the picture
that it is an ensemble of traps

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.620
which have very different
trap frequencies.

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.280
And then we would expect,
based on our understanding

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.860
of the spectrum of
confined particles,

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.190
that we have a carrier,
which is always the same,

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.600
at the electronic
excitation frequency.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.130
But then we have sidebands
at the trap frequency.

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.450
But those sidebands
are now smeared out,

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:56.010
because we do not have a
defined harmonic oscillator

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:57.520
potential here.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:03.040
So therefore, I sort of
tried to lead you in the way

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:07.340
that that may be one way how you
can think about the situation.

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.950
And well, now I want to give you
a different way to look at it.

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:14.110
And let's see how those
things come together.

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:26.260
So if I would ask you, give
me a quantitative estimate

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.444
how wide this line
is, do you have

00:05:29.444 --> 00:05:30.610
any idea how we can do that?

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.284
Or let me even put it this way.

00:05:38.284 --> 00:05:39.950
It's again one of
those kind of things--

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:43.080
you have the knowledge, but
to put it together is hard.

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.370
But I would guarantee
everybody in this room

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:49.897
has the knowledge to write
down in one line what

00:05:49.897 --> 00:05:50.980
is the width of this line.

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:03.630
What is the width of this line?

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:04.980
It's an inverse time.

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:05.690
What time?

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.970
Coherence time.

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:11.690
Yeah.

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:16.190
But now, if you have an
atom which is now starting

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:19.010
and it hits buffer
gas, how would you

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:22.970
estimate the coherence time?

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:24.750
AUDIENCE: Mean free pass.

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:29.070
PROFESSOR: Mean free
pass will be important.

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:30.860
But the coherence
time-- how long

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:34.065
will the atom talk to the laser
beam in a phase-coherent way?

00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:38.510
So what do we have to
compare to the wavelengths?

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:39.310
AUDIENCE: Mean free pass.

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:40.750
PROFESSOR: The mean free pass.

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:42.422
This will be the
important parameter.

00:06:42.422 --> 00:06:44.130
But if the mean free
pass is much shorter

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:47.100
than the wavelengths?

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:51.310
Well, the atom has just
moved a tiny bit, one mean.

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:53.115
Is it still coherent
at this time?

00:06:53.115 --> 00:06:54.656
AUDIENCE: It's
shorter than the wave.

00:06:54.656 --> 00:06:57.120
PROFESSOR: If the mean free
path is shorter than the wave.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.230
So it will do many collisions.

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:04.790
But since it stays localized, it
will still coherently interact.

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:08.502
When will it stop
coherently interacting?

00:07:08.502 --> 00:07:09.870
AUDIENCE: Mean free path.

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:12.036
PROFESSOR: No, the mean
free path is always smaller.

00:07:12.036 --> 00:07:14.420
Let's just assume that.

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:15.330
I hear "diffusion."

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:17.610
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:18.930
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:21.235
The atom has a short
mean free path,

00:07:21.235 --> 00:07:23.500
but it will do a random walk.

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:28.430
And the movement it diffuses
by more than a wavelength,

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:34.630
it has randomly changed its
position by a wavelength.

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:36.670
And that would
mean it experiences

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:39.190
the phase of the drive
field in a random way.

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:40.690
End of coherence.

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:44.801
1 over this time
is its line width.

00:07:44.801 --> 00:07:45.300
OK.

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:48.140
So let me write that down.

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:52.980
So based on the
concepts we have learned

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:55.450
by looking at Doppler
broadening and all that,

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:57.920
we realize the
important aspect is,

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:03.490
when do atoms in an ensemble
randomly move by a wavelength?

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:10.140
So therefore, our
estimate is now--

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:20.451
estimate the widths
of the sharp peak.

00:08:20.451 --> 00:08:22.720
We use a model
which is diffusion.

00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:30.110
We know that in diffusion,
the random walk, the RMS

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:33.650
position in atom has moved away.

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:36.370
Ballistic motion
is linear in time.

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:39.330
Diffusive motion is the
square root of time,

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:41.720
or z square is linear in time.

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:43.230
And we have the
diffusion constant.

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:53.030
Diffusion by, well,
lambda or lambda

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:59.055
bar after time, which
is wavelength squared.

00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:10.615
So therefore, we would
expect that the full width

00:09:10.615 --> 00:09:20.000
at 1/2 maximum of our peak
is k squared-- k, the wave

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.905
vector of the light, and D
is the diffusion constant.

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:43.720
Well, since you mentioned
the mean free path, let me,

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:46.930
already at this point-- I
wanted to do it earlier,

00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:48.550
but it fits in very well here.

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:56.610
In an ideal gas, the
diffusion constant

00:09:56.610 --> 00:10:04.050
is given by some thermal average
speed times the mean free path.

00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:06.920
And if you look
up some textbooks,

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:08.160
there's a factor of 3.

00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:21.260
So our delta omega,
which is k squared

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:27.800
D. Let me write it
as k times v bar.

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:35.160
And the other k I write
as 1 over lambda bar.

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:38.460
So this is k squared,
and I need l.

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:41.564
So this is nothing
else than k squared--

00:10:41.564 --> 00:10:44.540
I take this expression,
k squared l.

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:46.540
This is one k, this
is the other k.

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:51.650
And v bar times l is
the ideal gas expression

00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:54.700
for the diffusion constant.

00:10:54.700 --> 00:11:00.700
But now you realize that k, dot,
v-- since in a gas, the most

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:03.790
probably velocity is
also the momentum spread,

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:06.980
this is nothing else
than the Doppler width.

00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:16.750
So therefore, we find
that the line widths

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:19.840
in Dicke narrowing--
if we have buffer gas

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:28.450
and we have diffusive
motion-- is much smaller--

00:11:28.450 --> 00:11:31.370
and this is why it's
called Dicke narrowing--

00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:37.690
than the Doppler broadening
if the mean free path is

00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:40.970
much smaller than
the wavelength.

00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:44.900
So this is where the
mean free path comes in.

00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:47.630
What happens if
the mean free path

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:49.703
is much longer than
the wavelength?

00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:57.120
What line widths do we then get?

00:12:02.676 --> 00:12:04.390
Do we then have a
line width which

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:05.973
is larger than the
Doppler broadening,

00:12:05.973 --> 00:12:08.720
or do we get the
Doppler broadening?

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:11.690
Let's have a clicker question.

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:19.070
So if l is much smaller
than lambda bar,

00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:28.580
is delta omega-- and this
is your option A-- equal to?

00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:34.210
Or option B, larger?

00:12:43.294 --> 00:12:43.794
OK.

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:54.570
So what do you think?

00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:56.890
It's always a question
when we derive something,

00:12:56.890 --> 00:12:59.940
how seriously you should
take what we derived.

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:04.330
So this expression
for delta omega Dicke

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:06.930
shows that the line width
would get larger and larger

00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:10.360
the longer the
mean free path is.

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:13.037
And the question is,
is that correct or not?

00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:23.410
OK.

00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:26.016
Any more takers?

00:13:26.016 --> 00:13:27.120
Whoops.

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:27.620
Oops.

00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:28.411
Sorry, press again.

00:13:28.411 --> 00:13:31.250
I erased it by clicking
the wrong button.

00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:33.090
You've already
made up your mind.

00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:35.510
You know the answer.

00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:39.340
So stop, display.

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:41.950
Yes.

00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:43.700
The majority answer
is definitely correct.

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:47.820
What happens until the
first collision happens,

00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:49.790
you just have
normal Doppler-- you

00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:52.390
don't have diffusive motion,
you have ballistic motion.

00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:56.240
And if the line width is already
determined once the atoms have

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:59.150
spread out by a wavelength,
that's it already.

00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:02.150
And then if then the particles
collide, it doesn't matter.

00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:04.810
So what we have assumed
is we've assumed

00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:07.600
that the relevant model for
the spread out to a wavelength

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:08.580
is a diffusive model.

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:11.810
And if we are past that--
because the mean free path is

00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:13.310
larger than the
wavelength-- we have

00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:15.150
to go back to normal
Doppler broadening.

00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:17.970
OK.

00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:26.970
But now let me calculate
Dicke narrowing

00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:35.500
by using the formalism
we have developed.

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:38.210
So let's use the correlation
function for that.

00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:47.850
And we know that the line
width was nothing else

00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:51.500
than the Fourier transform
of the correlation function,

00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:54.670
how the atoms
experience the drive

00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:58.470
field at two different times.

00:14:58.470 --> 00:15:00.800
So we had here the
matrix element,

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:03.990
the Rabi frequency squared.

00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:10.730
We have between time
t and t plus tau,

00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:13.480
the phase of the drive
field accumulates

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:15.850
e to the i omega tau.

00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:22.560
But now we have the e
to the minus ikr factor.

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:26.250
And r, or the position--
in diffusion, you

00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:30.360
often call it s-- changes now,
because the particle undergoes

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:32.000
a random walk.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.960
So what we have to do is to
describe collisional narrowing,

00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:39.520
we have to take this
factor and average it

00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:45.080
over our ensemble of
diffusing particles.

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:49.650
And well, diffusion means that
if particles start out at t

00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:53.940
equals 0 at the
origin, the probability

00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:57.410
that we find the
particle at time t,

00:15:57.410 --> 00:16:01.690
a distance s away
from the origin--

00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:04.300
so I'm depicting this one here.

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:06.760
The particle does
sort of a random walk.

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:11.840
And after time t, it
is out at a position s.

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:18.400
And the probability for
that is e to the minus

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:22.920
s squared over 4 Dt.

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:26.100
And you see it's s
is quadratic over t.

00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:28.840
This is a random walk. s
increases s's square root

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:30.540
of time.

00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:35.895
And the probability is
normalized by this expression.

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:49.320
So therefore, this red average
in the correlation function

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:56.720
is calculated by convoluting
with this probability

00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:58.710
distribution for
the random walk.

00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:10.839
So it is e to the minus
iks, e to the minus

00:17:10.839 --> 00:17:16.220
s squared over 4 D. The
time is now called tau.

00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:19.420
We used to integrate
over all possibilities.

00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:23.115
And e to the i omega
tau is a common factor.

00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:33.900
My notes show that the integral
is done from minus infinity

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:34.925
to plus infinity.

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:40.810
Either this is right, or
there's a factor of two

00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:45.560
to be accounted, because
well, it depends.

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:47.810
Now, is s a coordinate,
or is s in radians?

00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:51.800
In one case, it has a sign,
in the other case, it has not.

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:53.390
I'm not able to
reconstruct it now,

00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:55.560
but it's just a
numerical factor,

00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:57.820
which would be affected by that.

00:17:57.820 --> 00:18:00.360
So the result of
this integral is

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:03.320
that we obtain an
exponential function.

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:15.930
So what we find out
is that there is now

00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:19.745
an exponentially
decaying function.

00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:25.790
Remember, we had situations
where the correlation function

00:18:25.790 --> 00:18:29.140
for how the atom
experiences a coherent field

00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:30.600
was decaying
exponentially because

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:32.140
of spontaneous lifetime?

00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:33.790
And now we have an
exponential decay,

00:18:33.790 --> 00:18:36.060
because the particle
is defusing around.

00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:43.850
But we also know, of course,
that exponential decay, when

00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:47.630
we Fourier analyze it,
gives us a Lorentzian.

00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:52.090
So when we ask what is the
rate, Fermi's golden rule's

00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:55.000
rate expression, the
rate for excitation.

00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:04.230
We want to do the Fourier
transform of this correlation

00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:05.850
function.

00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:21.540
And what we obtain is, well,
a Lorentzian which looks

00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:24.320
like the Lorentzian for
spontaneous emission,

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:30.230
except for that we have
a different width now.

00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:48.720
It's a Lorentzian with a
width 2 k squared times D.

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:49.950
So pretty straightforward.

00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:52.580
But I hope you've
seen and you've

00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:55.200
enjoyed there's a very
intuitive picture.

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:57.250
But the correlation
function-- if you just

00:19:57.250 --> 00:19:59.350
look at it from the
perspective of the atoms,

00:19:59.350 --> 00:20:01.870
how do I experience
a coherent field?

00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:03.970
You put in simply
the diffusive motion.

00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:08.620
You can exactly calculate
what the line shape is.

00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:11.420
And that's definitely
something you would not

00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:14.750
have known how to do it
without this formalism.

00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:15.250
OK.

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:25.060
I have a question for you.

00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:34.110
And this is, how does the
spectrum for diffusive motion

00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:35.860
look like?

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:39.090
What we have just
calculated was that it

00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:48.020
is a Lorentzian with the line
widths we've just determined.

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:50.890
But I want to give
you another choice.

00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:57.150
And this is what we discussed
at the end of the last class.

00:20:57.150 --> 00:21:01.040
This picture where we took
the confined particles

00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:04.280
to the ridiculous limit-- where
there was no trap anymore,

00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:06.630
just collisions--
suggested actually

00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:08.610
that we have some sharp line.

00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:12.080
But then this envelope
of those sidebands

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:18.100
give some unresolved pedestal.

00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:22.820
So the question is,
what is correct?

00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:24.940
We have just done a
quantitative calculation

00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:26.650
using the model, a
diffusion propagator.

00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:33.030
But we also had this
intuitive picture,

00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:37.980
which had more this kind
of bimodal distribution.

00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:41.570
A broad pedestal
and a sharp peak.

00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:45.510
And I want you to think
about it for a few seconds.

00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:47.720
What would you expect to
be the correct answer?

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:55.520
Is the line shape
just a Lorentzian,

00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:58.200
or does the line shape have
two different parts to it?

00:22:27.850 --> 00:22:28.350
OK.

00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:35.930
Does somebody want to speak out
in favor of his or her choice?

00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:46.780
Well, one argument is,
when you derive something,

00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:50.190
it must be more correct than
when you wave your hands.

00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:52.500
Therefore, we
derived a Lorentzian,

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:54.750
and the other picture
was just waving our hands

00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:57.350
and using some analogy.

00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:59.050
OK.

00:22:59.050 --> 00:23:01.180
That would be one
argument to vote

00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:07.350
for A. Somebody
wants to defend B?

00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:15.030
Pardon?

00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:16.200
AUDIENCE: More intuitive.

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:17.920
PROFESSOR: More intuitive.

00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:18.750
Yes.

00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:21.980
You know, something
must be right about it.

00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:25.050
I mean, in some limit,
this must be like a trap,

00:23:25.050 --> 00:23:28.600
and there should
be some sidebands.

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:31.280
Yes.

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:31.960
OK.

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:37.970
But now I would ask you-- Nancy,
if you say it's more intuitive,

00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:43.570
why don't we get
those broadening?

00:23:43.570 --> 00:23:45.620
Why don't we get
this extra pedestal

00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:49.088
in our quantitative derivation?

00:23:49.088 --> 00:23:50.996
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:50.996 --> 00:23:53.430
PROFESSOR: But what?

00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:56.260
Didn't we lose the exact
probability distribution

00:23:56.260 --> 00:23:57.590
for diffusive process?

00:23:57.590 --> 00:24:00.050
AUDIENCE: There's no
harmonic oscillator.

00:24:00.050 --> 00:24:03.494
The sidebands [INAUDIBLE]
harmonic oscillator.

00:24:07.922 --> 00:24:09.920
PROFESSOR: So that's
an argument also for A.

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:11.590
We don't have a
harmonic oscillator.

00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:15.080
And when I said there is sort
of this trap-type feature,

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:17.310
I'm really over-extending
the analogy.

00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:19.230
AUDIENCE: The mean
free path is not--

00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:20.190
PROFESSOR: Pardon?

00:24:20.190 --> 00:24:22.610
AUDIENCE: The mean free path
is not infinitesimally small.

00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:25.680
PROFESSOR: The mean free path
is not infinitesimally small.

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:28.980
Now we're getting close.

00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:33.720
We assumed diffusive motion.

00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:37.930
We put in the exact expression
for diffusive motion.

00:24:37.930 --> 00:24:41.840
And of course, you also know,
when you describe a line width,

00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:44.310
what happens in the
middle at detuning

00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:48.130
0 is more what happens in
the limit of long times.

00:24:48.130 --> 00:24:54.050
What happens further and further
out happens at shorter times.

00:24:54.050 --> 00:24:56.850
What is the motion of
atoms at short times?

00:25:02.370 --> 00:25:05.850
Before the first collision
happens, it moves straight.

00:25:05.850 --> 00:25:08.950
So the diffusive
propagator which we put in

00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:11.300
is only valid after
the first collision.

00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:14.950
Until the first collision
happens, we have free motion.

00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:19.670
And free motion should give rise
to simple Doppler broadening.

00:25:19.670 --> 00:25:21.380
So until the first
collision happens,

00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:22.990
we should get a little
bit of Doppler broadening.

00:25:22.990 --> 00:25:24.390
But once the
collisions happened,

00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:26.700
we should be very well
within the description

00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:28.740
of the diffusion operator.

00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:31.525
And to address your
concern, actually,

00:25:31.525 --> 00:25:34.340
in the limit of many
sideband, often,

00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:36.860
the envelope of
all those sidebands

00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:38.960
is actually determined
by the Doppler profile.

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:42.470
There is a limit, if you have
a large modulation index,

00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:45.890
that you have many sidebands.

00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:47.800
And in some
semi-classical limit,

00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:51.310
the sidebands have an envelope
which is the Doppler profile.

00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:54.100
So now I think the
two pictures agree.

00:25:54.100 --> 00:26:02.560
If we had used a propagator
which would interpolate

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:05.470
between the first moment where
the particle moves straight,

00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:09.030
and then diffusion, we would
have gotten little pedestals

00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:10.400
here.

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:14.870
And so that sort of tells us
that the smeared outside bands,

00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:18.460
yes, strictly speaking, they
are linked to harmonic motion.

00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:19.954
But they are sort
of the leftover

00:26:19.954 --> 00:26:22.120
of the motional effect,
which is the Doppler effect.

00:26:25.410 --> 00:26:25.910
OK.

00:26:30.401 --> 00:26:30.900
Good.

00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:35.600
So we have the
correct answer here.

00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:46.130
And here, it is the model
neglects ballistic motion

00:26:46.130 --> 00:26:51.465
until the first collision.

00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:54.450
Questions?

00:27:03.650 --> 00:27:04.190
OK.

00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:12.930
Let's now spend 10
minutes discussing

00:27:12.930 --> 00:27:15.500
the fluorescent
spectrum of an atom.

00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:27.310
As I pointed out in my overview,
we teach much more about it

00:27:27.310 --> 00:27:28.205
in 8.422.

00:27:28.205 --> 00:27:30.280
We use a dressed atom picture.

00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:34.400
But something would be missing
if I wouldn't do it also

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:38.120
in this course, because
we have discussed

00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:41.400
to quite some extent what
happens when we excite atoms

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:43.970
with light.

00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:47.380
And what we have
discussed so far

00:27:47.380 --> 00:28:00.220
is that we excite atom and scan
the laser, or the excitation

00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:01.840
frequency.

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:16.240
And when we are plotting the
intensity of the fluorescence,

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:20.040
we are looking at the
number of scattered photon.

00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:24.900
And what we are scanning is
the detuning of the laser.

00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:36.310
We would expect, in the case
of a motionless atom, simply

00:28:36.310 --> 00:28:41.500
a Lorentzian, or in
the general limit,

00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:43.240
a power-broadened Lorentzian.

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:51.090
Just to be clear, what I'm
discussing in those 10 minutes

00:28:51.090 --> 00:28:54.950
is I'm completely ignoring
that the atom can move.

00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:56.450
So you should think
that it's either

00:28:56.450 --> 00:29:00.350
an atom with infinite mass,
or it's an atom tightly

00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:02.360
localized in the
Lamb-Dicke limit,

00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:07.660
and all we are looking at is the
structure of the central peak.

00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:08.820
So no motional effects.

00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:12.550
We just look at the pure
kind of intrinsic line

00:29:12.550 --> 00:29:16.245
widths of the
electronic transition.

00:29:16.245 --> 00:29:16.890
OK.

00:29:16.890 --> 00:29:18.500
So we have discussed that.

00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:26.940
But now I want to look at
another aspect of spectroscopy.

00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:30.290
And this is another
scan we can do.

00:29:30.290 --> 00:29:33.160
We want to have
a fixed detuning.

00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:47.490
And we look at the spectrum
of the emitted light.

00:29:52.330 --> 00:29:56.890
So let's assume that
we have a laser which

00:29:56.890 --> 00:29:59.590
is at a detuning delta.

00:29:59.590 --> 00:30:01.700
The laser is fixed.

00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:03.720
The light is emitting.

00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:07.070
But we are now dispersing
with a spectrograph.

00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:10.600
We are analyzing what is the
frequency of the emitted light.

00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:12.090
And we determine the spectrum.

00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:19.340
And yes, the question is,
how does it look like?

00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:21.680
And I want to give
you four options.

00:30:31.010 --> 00:30:37.040
So this is 0 detuning
at resonance.

00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:38.010
Oops, I need one more.

00:30:43.290 --> 00:30:45.600
Let me relabel it
to make it clear.

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:56.840
So our option one
is our spectrum

00:30:56.840 --> 00:31:01.440
is a delta function at
the resonance of the atom.

00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:16.010
Option two is it is a Lorentzian
centered around the resonance.

00:31:19.630 --> 00:31:31.370
Option three is it is a
delta function at the laser

00:31:31.370 --> 00:31:33.110
frequency.

00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:44.700
And option four is it is a
Lorentzian with line width

00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:46.380
gamma.

00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:48.130
So we have two options.

00:31:48.130 --> 00:31:51.750
Is it a delta function
at omega 0 or omega l?

00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:54.700
Or is it a Lorentzian-broadened
function at either omega 0

00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:57.050
or omega l.

00:31:57.050 --> 00:32:02.760
And since we want to
keep things simple,

00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:08.030
we want to first discuss the
case of the perturbative case

00:32:08.030 --> 00:32:12.990
that the laser which excites
the atom has very low power.

00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:14.370
So what would you expect?

00:32:14.370 --> 00:32:17.040
An atom is excited, it's
a little light bulb.

00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:19.890
You analyze the spectrum
of the light bulb.

00:32:19.890 --> 00:32:22.720
Which of the four
spectrum will you measure?

00:33:04.570 --> 00:33:07.320
OK.

00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:08.320
Let's try again.

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:11.470
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:11.470 --> 00:33:15.510
And maybe I should, like
our online learning system,

00:33:15.510 --> 00:33:17.770
try to give you one hint.

00:33:17.770 --> 00:33:22.620
I want you to really think hard
what energy conservation means

00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:23.330
in this problem.

00:33:46.741 --> 00:33:47.240
OK.

00:33:53.530 --> 00:33:55.890
OK, we're getting closer.

00:33:55.890 --> 00:33:58.640
Now, the way how I want
you to think about it

00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:04.030
is if you take the
limit of low power,

00:34:04.030 --> 00:34:06.450
you should really think
about it that there

00:34:06.450 --> 00:34:09.210
is only one photon in
your whole laboratory.

00:34:09.210 --> 00:34:11.260
This photon is
scattered of an atom,

00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:14.380
and then you measure the
frequency of the photon.

00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:20.030
And energy conservation clearly
tells us that the frequency

00:34:20.030 --> 00:34:23.820
of the scattered photon cannot
be at the resonance frequency.

00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:25.880
It has to be at the
laser frequency.

00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:29.310
Otherwise, we would
violate energy.

00:34:29.310 --> 00:34:31.600
But it seems-- still,
the more subtle thing

00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:34.850
is, is it a delta function?

00:34:34.850 --> 00:34:39.016
Of course, a delta
function will be broadened.

00:34:39.016 --> 00:34:41.320
If you do the experiment
for one second,

00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:44.239
you will have a Fourier
line width which is 1 hertz.

00:34:44.239 --> 00:34:46.590
But that's, for
practical reasons, almost

00:34:46.590 --> 00:34:49.580
like a delta function, because
the spectral line widths,

00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:51.884
or the natural line widths
of your favorite atom

00:34:51.884 --> 00:34:53.699
is 10 megahertz.

00:34:53.699 --> 00:34:55.989
So there will be some
temporal broadening,

00:34:55.989 --> 00:34:58.810
which is in case in any
realistic experiment.

00:34:58.810 --> 00:35:01.660
But we are talking about, are
you limited by the experiment

00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:03.580
and by technical
noise, or are you

00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:06.610
limited by the
natural line widths?

00:35:06.610 --> 00:35:09.341
Now, I would argue, just
with energy conservation--

00:35:09.341 --> 00:35:11.340
but I'll give you another
argument in a second--

00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:13.560
that if I have a
monochromatic laser,

00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:15.140
the photon which
has to come out has

00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:17.370
to be exactly the
same frequency.

00:35:17.370 --> 00:35:20.360
Because we talked about
energy conservation.

00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:23.500
And if I would start with a
photon at the laser frequency

00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:27.630
and I would measure a photon
which has 10 megahertz away,

00:35:27.630 --> 00:35:32.310
I would violate energy
conservation by 10 megahertz.

00:35:32.310 --> 00:35:34.490
So the argument is
actually correct.

00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:41.390
It's a delta function
at the drive frequency.

00:35:41.390 --> 00:35:45.730
But I want to give
you another argument.

00:35:45.730 --> 00:35:48.600
It's, again, something you
have heard in the course.

00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:50.400
But you should really
take it seriously,

00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:52.080
and apply to that situation.

00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:53.290
And that's the following.

00:35:53.290 --> 00:35:56.480
Remember when we talked
about the AC stark effect.

00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:58.940
I told you that
you should really

00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:04.240
think about the atom as
a harmonic oscillator.

00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:07.380
We even introduced for you
the oscillator strengths

00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:10.560
that we could even
quantitatively describe

00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:16.110
the response of the atom
to the scattering of light

00:36:16.110 --> 00:36:18.800
by pretty much a model where we
have a mechanical model where

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:22.680
an electron is attached
with a spring to an origin.

00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:24.717
OK.

00:36:24.717 --> 00:36:26.175
Let me now paraphrase
the question.

00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:32.507
Well, I've given you the answer.

00:36:32.507 --> 00:36:34.090
Before giving you
the answer, I should

00:36:34.090 --> 00:36:36.165
have asked you the
following-- if you now

00:36:36.165 --> 00:36:39.730
make the assumption that you
have a harmonic oscillator,

00:36:39.730 --> 00:36:44.590
the harmonic oscillator has a
resonance frequency of omega 0.

00:36:44.590 --> 00:36:48.600
And it has a damping
rate of gamma.

00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:52.850
But we are driving the harmonic
oscillator not at omega 0;

00:36:52.850 --> 00:36:55.780
we were driving it at
a frequency omega l.

00:36:59.321 --> 00:37:03.280
At what frequency does the
harmonic oscillator respond?

00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:06.502
At the drive frequency
or at its own frequency?

00:37:06.502 --> 00:37:07.386
AUDIENCE: Drive.

00:37:07.386 --> 00:37:08.290
PROFESSOR: Of course.

00:37:08.290 --> 00:37:10.300
It's a drive frequency.

00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:13.920
And if you have a CW experiment,
I said let's wait a second,

00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:17.600
let's really do a
long experiment,

00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:19.440
if you have a driven
harmonic oscillator,

00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:21.560
and you drive it
for a long time,

00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:26.090
and you analyze the
spectrum of the motion,

00:37:26.090 --> 00:37:30.300
is the frequency spectrum of
the driven harmonic oscillator

00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:32.920
absolutely sharp at
the drive frequency?

00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:35.885
Or is it broadened by
gamma, the damping constant

00:37:35.885 --> 00:37:37.010
of the harmonic oscillator?

00:37:40.589 --> 00:37:41.563
AUDIENCE: Sharp.

00:37:44.485 --> 00:37:46.506
PROFESSOR: Who
thinks it's sharp?

00:37:46.506 --> 00:37:49.380
Who thinks it's broad?

00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:51.200
Hands up for sharp.

00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:53.699
Hands up for broad.

00:37:53.699 --> 00:37:54.199
OK.

00:37:54.199 --> 00:37:55.185
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:55.185 --> 00:37:58.870
PROFESSOR: Look, what you are
overlooking is the following.

00:37:58.870 --> 00:38:01.220
There is the difference
between a transient, which

00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:03.390
is damped out at a rate gamma.

00:38:03.390 --> 00:38:06.000
But then there is
the CW response.

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:10.230
If you have an ultra-weak drive,
you leave it on for an hour,

00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:12.730
the harmonic oscillator
will reach steady state.

00:38:12.730 --> 00:38:15.910
And it will just oscillate
driven by your drive.

00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:18.070
And it's actually monochromatic.

00:38:18.070 --> 00:38:20.010
And if you analyze
the motion, it's

00:38:20.010 --> 00:38:22.890
a harmonic oscillator in
steady state with a drive,

00:38:22.890 --> 00:38:26.480
and it just moves with a fixed
amplitude and fixed frequency.

00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:29.580
I mean, the way how
I shake my hands,

00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:33.730
this is a delta function
at the drive frequency.

00:38:33.730 --> 00:38:36.780
So in this simple
harmonic oscillator model,

00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:40.410
gamma and damping
comes in when you

00:38:40.410 --> 00:38:47.890
do what I discussed
earlier, when

00:38:47.890 --> 00:38:49.890
you change the drive frequency.

00:38:49.890 --> 00:38:52.356
But this is a completely
different experiment.

00:38:52.356 --> 00:38:53.980
We are not changing
the drive frequency

00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:55.680
and looking for the response.

00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:58.136
We are a fixed drive
frequency, and we

00:38:58.136 --> 00:39:01.750
are analyzing what the
motion is which comes out.

00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:04.660
And then, as you know from
differential equation,

00:39:04.660 --> 00:39:06.500
you may have a grade transient.

00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:08.930
You may have a transient
at the resonance frequency

00:39:08.930 --> 00:39:12.750
which dies out
with a rate gamma.

00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:14.970
This is when you suddenly
switch on your drive,

00:39:14.970 --> 00:39:17.310
and you're not adiabatically
switching on your drive.

00:39:17.310 --> 00:39:19.130
But this is just a transient.

00:39:19.130 --> 00:39:21.910
But what we are asking here
when you do a CW experiment,

00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:25.400
you drive it for a long
time, you look what happens.

00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:31.970
And the motion of the
driven harmonic oscillator

00:39:31.970 --> 00:39:35.580
is a delta function
at the drive.

00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:37.970
And what is valid for
a harmonic oscillator

00:39:37.970 --> 00:39:39.930
is also valid for
the atom, pretty much

00:39:39.930 --> 00:39:40.805
for the same reasons.

00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:45.635
Any questions?

00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:49.740
Yes.

00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:51.781
AUDIENCE: Regarding the
energy conservation in D,

00:39:51.781 --> 00:39:56.418
wouldn't the photon processes
explain energy conservation?

00:39:56.418 --> 00:39:57.540
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:39:57.540 --> 00:39:59.240
You are now really
asking-- Nancy

00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:02.060
is asking about
two-photon processes.

00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:03.660
Well, we don't
want to stop here.

00:40:03.660 --> 00:40:05.689
We want to see something
more interesting.

00:40:05.689 --> 00:40:07.730
This is just sort of the
trivial, simple harmonic

00:40:07.730 --> 00:40:08.610
oscillator.

00:40:08.610 --> 00:40:13.862
The question is now, if you
want to see something richer,

00:40:13.862 --> 00:40:15.950
if we want to see a
little bit of broadening,

00:40:15.950 --> 00:40:18.650
or we want to see something
which is not as boring as just

00:40:18.650 --> 00:40:22.204
a classical harmonic oscillator,
what do we have to do?

00:40:22.204 --> 00:40:24.464
AUDIENCE: Increase the strength.

00:40:24.464 --> 00:40:27.260
PROFESSOR: Increase the
strengths of the field.

00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:30.502
And I heard somebody
saying, two photons.

00:40:30.502 --> 00:40:31.210
And that may be--

00:40:31.210 --> 00:40:31.780
AUDIENCE: Next-order
perturbation theory.

00:40:31.780 --> 00:40:32.720
PROFESSOR: Pardon?

00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:33.660
AUDIENCE: It's like next
order perturbation theory.

00:40:33.660 --> 00:40:35.660
PROFESSOR: Next-order
perturbation theory.

00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:37.770
But just in the sort
of intuitive picture,

00:40:37.770 --> 00:40:41.020
if you have two photons
which come quickly enough--

00:40:41.020 --> 00:40:44.370
and how quickly the two
photons come will be debated.

00:40:44.370 --> 00:40:46.685
Of course, it's parametrized
by the Rabi frequency,

00:40:46.685 --> 00:40:47.980
the strengths of the drive.

00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:50.859
But if two photons come
quickly, each photon

00:40:50.859 --> 00:40:52.900
has to be scattered with
a delta function because

00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:54.300
of energy conservation.

00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:56.910
But if we have two
photons, suddenly, it's

00:40:56.910 --> 00:40:59.920
possible that one is scattered
here and one is scattered here.

00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:01.760
And we still conserve energy.

00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:04.480
So if you want to see some form
of line broadening, if you want

00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:08.870
to see all the things
you have mentioned,

00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:11.250
we have to go away from
the low power limit.

00:41:15.740 --> 00:41:18.650
And this is what we do next.

00:41:22.250 --> 00:41:26.730
So we assume that we
have higher power.

00:41:29.316 --> 00:41:30.260
We are on resonance.

00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:45.130
And let me assume that the Rabi
frequency is larger than gamma.

00:41:49.020 --> 00:41:51.309
So what is the physics now
of the atom if the Rabi

00:41:51.309 --> 00:41:52.600
frequency is larger than gamma?

00:41:56.530 --> 00:41:59.570
It can do Rabi oscillation
before it's damped.

00:41:59.570 --> 00:42:04.420
So now we have a
system which has

00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:07.025
an internal dynamics
at the Rabi frequency.

00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:12.780
And you know if you
have an emitter,

00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:15.150
if you have an antenna
which emits light,

00:42:15.150 --> 00:42:18.870
and you move the antenna
around at a frequency--

00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:21.680
we had the example of a trapped
particle which has a trapped

00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:25.230
frequency of omega
trap-- the spectrum,

00:42:25.230 --> 00:42:29.450
if you Fourier transform, it
leads to the basal function,

00:42:29.450 --> 00:42:31.520
it leads to the sideband.

00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:35.820
So therefore, we know now,
based on all the analogies,

00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:38.310
if you have a modulated
emitter, we obtain sidebands.

00:42:43.210 --> 00:42:46.310
That's what we would
expect classically.

00:42:46.310 --> 00:42:49.490
So let me now ask you the
three following possibilities.

00:42:52.270 --> 00:42:55.410
Maybe we still get
a delta function.

00:42:55.410 --> 00:43:01.400
Maybe we get three peaks where
the splitting is the Rabi

00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:02.950
frequency.

00:43:02.950 --> 00:43:12.660
So the two outer
peaks have a-- and the

00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:17.810
third option is that yes, we
observe the Rabi frequency,

00:43:17.810 --> 00:43:20.740
but the Rabi frequency
is the splitting

00:43:20.740 --> 00:43:21.910
between the outer peaks.

00:43:26.350 --> 00:43:30.650
So the first and second
answer differ by a factor of 2

00:43:30.650 --> 00:43:32.005
in the sideband spacing.

00:43:35.730 --> 00:43:37.150
So we have three choices.

00:43:37.150 --> 00:43:38.750
Do we expect sidebands?

00:43:38.750 --> 00:43:42.890
That's A and B. Or would
you expect that we still

00:43:42.890 --> 00:43:45.589
have a delta function,
because, well, maybe energy has

00:43:45.589 --> 00:43:47.380
to be conserved at the
single photon level?

00:43:51.070 --> 00:43:55.880
And then is the splitting
Rabi frequency on each side,

00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:59.020
or Rabi frequency between
the two sidebands?

00:44:13.012 --> 00:44:13.512
All right.

00:44:18.410 --> 00:44:19.640
Yes.

00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:23.030
It's indeed the situation.

00:44:23.030 --> 00:44:27.280
For those who picked
A, it's pretty much

00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:29.155
the definition of what
the Rabi frequency is.

00:44:34.710 --> 00:44:38.300
After one cycle of
the Rabi frequency,

00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:41.040
the atom has gone
from the ground state

00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:44.390
to the excited state and
back to the ground state.

00:44:44.390 --> 00:44:48.520
So the model you should have is
that you have an object which

00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:50.050
is emitting light,
but the object

00:44:50.050 --> 00:44:53.980
has some internal modulation
at the Rabi frequency.

00:44:53.980 --> 00:44:58.260
Whatever factor of 2
you had in the amplitude

00:44:58.260 --> 00:45:00.540
versus probability or
something, all this

00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:02.620
has been factored into
the definition of the Rabi

00:45:02.620 --> 00:45:05.680
frequency in such a way
the atom is really blinking

00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:08.230
between ground and excited
state with a frequency

00:45:08.230 --> 00:45:09.970
which is the Rabi frequency.

00:45:09.970 --> 00:45:14.020
And this frequency
leads-- and the spectrum

00:45:14.020 --> 00:45:20.600
is now the sum and difference
of the relevant frequencies.

00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:24.850
And the relevant frequency
is the resonance frequency

00:45:24.850 --> 00:45:26.780
and the Rabi frequency.

00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:28.980
So the answer is B.

00:45:28.980 --> 00:45:33.880
But this was sort of more
in form of a stick diagram.

00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:38.140
Now I want to bring in
in the next question

00:45:38.140 --> 00:45:40.280
the line broadening.

00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:47.950
So the question is-- and
there are again four choices.

00:45:47.950 --> 00:45:52.905
The question is, we have
now our three sticks.

00:45:55.610 --> 00:45:59.660
One is a carrier, and these
are the two sidebands split off

00:45:59.660 --> 00:46:02.470
by a Rabi frequency.

00:46:02.470 --> 00:46:06.140
Are all three sticks now
sharp delta functions?

00:46:10.450 --> 00:46:13.490
Are all three sticks broadened
by the natural line widths?

00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:20.470
Is the central part
sharp, and only the

00:46:20.470 --> 00:46:22.850
sidebands are broadened?

00:46:22.850 --> 00:46:28.102
Or do we have a sharp
stick with a pedestal,

00:46:28.102 --> 00:46:29.060
and then two sidebands?

00:46:31.810 --> 00:46:34.960
I'm not actually expecting
all of you to know the answer,

00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:37.160
because this is
really now getting

00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:38.380
into more subtle things.

00:46:38.380 --> 00:46:42.680
But just in terms
of show-and-tell,

00:46:42.680 --> 00:46:46.040
and attract your curiosity
to the second part

00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:49.140
of the course, what
would you expect?

00:47:20.045 --> 00:47:20.545
OK.

00:47:25.580 --> 00:47:26.130
Yes.

00:47:26.130 --> 00:47:26.960
Good.

00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:31.150
A is definitely eliminated.

00:47:31.150 --> 00:47:34.430
I mean, if we scatter two
photons simultaneously, there

00:47:34.430 --> 00:47:38.090
will be sort of
broadening of gamma,

00:47:38.090 --> 00:47:39.840
because the atom has
a natural broadening.

00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:43.940
So we can't expect that the
two photon processes are sharp.

00:47:43.940 --> 00:47:45.330
There's no reason
to expect that.

00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:57.120
The answer between B,
C, and D depends now.

00:47:57.120 --> 00:48:00.820
If we have very, very little
power, what we observe

00:48:00.820 --> 00:48:04.200
is, of course, the
low-power delta function.

00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:07.470
And then we observe very,
very small sidebands

00:48:07.470 --> 00:48:10.070
which are broadened.

00:48:10.070 --> 00:48:12.200
So answer C is correct.

00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:14.370
If you just think
about it-- what

00:48:14.370 --> 00:48:16.820
is the structure of
infinitesimal peaks?

00:48:16.820 --> 00:48:20.290
But when you crank up the
power, and what you have is

00:48:20.290 --> 00:48:22.200
you have an elastic
scattering peak,

00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:24.530
which has a delta function,
energy conservation

00:48:24.530 --> 00:48:26.180
at the single photon level.

00:48:26.180 --> 00:48:30.280
And then you have those-- they
are called inelastic peaks.

00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:35.030
But when you crank up the
power, then the central feature

00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:38.150
has also an inelastic component.

00:48:38.150 --> 00:48:41.115
You can sort of argue
that in Rabi oscillation,

00:48:41.115 --> 00:48:43.490
you are in the ground state,
excited state, ground state,

00:48:43.490 --> 00:48:44.210
excited state.

00:48:44.210 --> 00:48:46.960
But if you do now light
scattering in the excited

00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:49.230
state, you
automatically broaden it

00:48:49.230 --> 00:48:52.380
by the lifetime of
the excited state.

00:48:52.380 --> 00:48:55.870
And if you crank up the
power higher and higher,

00:48:55.870 --> 00:48:59.050
the elastic peak will be
more and more suppressed.

00:48:59.050 --> 00:49:01.210
And you find actually
a spectrum which

00:49:01.210 --> 00:49:03.695
has only three broadened
peaks, and the delta function

00:49:03.695 --> 00:49:05.860
has disappeared.

00:49:05.860 --> 00:49:10.380
It will actually be something
where we need more knowledge.

00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:14.030
The broadening of those
peaks is not gamma anymore.

00:49:14.030 --> 00:49:16.410
One of them will be 3/2
gamma, the other one

00:49:16.410 --> 00:49:18.720
will be 1/2 gamma.

00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:22.820
But this now really requires
a deeper understanding

00:49:22.820 --> 00:49:24.860
in terms of the atom picture.

00:49:24.860 --> 00:49:27.100
But the scale of
all the broadening

00:49:27.100 --> 00:49:31.700
is a factor on the order
of unity times gamma.

00:49:31.700 --> 00:49:32.500
Any questions?

00:49:39.210 --> 00:49:43.670
So the general answer, sorry,
would be-- the generic picture

00:49:43.670 --> 00:49:46.080
which you should keep
in your mind is that.

00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:50.010
You have inelastic scattering
on all three peaks.

00:49:50.010 --> 00:49:55.060
But the limit of D at
very low power is that.

00:49:55.060 --> 00:50:01.655
And at very high power, is that.

00:50:01.655 --> 00:50:04.710
The elastic component
of the central peak

00:50:04.710 --> 00:50:06.290
is either 100% or 0%.

00:50:16.510 --> 00:50:17.010
OK.

00:50:33.580 --> 00:50:45.670
So our last topic for line
shapes and line broadening

00:50:45.670 --> 00:50:48.270
is pressure broadening.

00:50:48.270 --> 00:50:50.890
And as I mentioned
in the introduction,

00:50:50.890 --> 00:50:54.600
pressure broadening has
made modern appearances

00:50:54.600 --> 00:50:58.290
in the form of clock shift,
and mean field shifts,

00:50:58.290 --> 00:51:02.450
and mean field broadenings
in Bose-Einstein condensates.

00:51:02.450 --> 00:51:05.360
But let me sort of
tell you how you

00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:07.260
should understand
pressure broadening.

00:51:10.110 --> 00:51:14.590
I'm using here the
semi-classical picture

00:51:14.590 --> 00:51:19.155
that an excited atom
acts as an oscillator.

00:51:23.210 --> 00:51:29.660
And what happened is the atom--
you can say the oscillation

00:51:29.660 --> 00:51:32.990
is superposition of
ground and excited state.

00:51:32.990 --> 00:51:35.150
It oscillates.

00:51:35.150 --> 00:51:46.920
But after some time tau, there
may be a quenching collision,

00:51:46.920 --> 00:51:48.280
a de-excitation collision.

00:51:52.030 --> 00:51:55.950
Then the atom is sort
of in the ground state.

00:51:55.950 --> 00:51:59.130
And then it waits until it's
excited again by the laser,

00:51:59.130 --> 00:52:03.540
and the atomic dipole
is oscillating again.

00:52:03.540 --> 00:52:05.840
In a situation like
this, you would

00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:11.730
expect that the total
line widths is actually

00:52:11.730 --> 00:52:13.450
the sum of two rates.

00:52:13.450 --> 00:52:17.100
One is the spontaneous
emission rate,

00:52:17.100 --> 00:52:23.520
and the other one would be the
collision rate, which is this.

00:52:28.710 --> 00:52:33.660
And in general, this is sort
of how people looked at it.

00:52:33.660 --> 00:52:37.250
You vary the pressure
in your buffer gas cell,

00:52:37.250 --> 00:52:40.490
and you find that the line
width has a component which

00:52:40.490 --> 00:52:42.520
increases linearly
with pressure.

00:52:45.900 --> 00:52:49.390
So this is one model
how you can imagine

00:52:49.390 --> 00:52:51.470
what happens in a collision.

00:52:51.470 --> 00:52:54.470
These are like
knock-out collisions.

00:52:54.470 --> 00:52:57.730
When an atom collides,
the excitation, the energy

00:52:57.730 --> 00:52:58.460
disappears.

00:52:58.460 --> 00:53:01.940
The atom is quenched
to the ground state.

00:53:01.940 --> 00:53:05.770
Well, we can draw
up another model,

00:53:05.770 --> 00:53:14.310
where we have an oscillation
of our atomic oscillator.

00:53:14.310 --> 00:53:23.240
But then after
the same time tau,

00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:26.100
there is now a
hiccup in the phase.

00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:28.290
It collides with another atom.

00:53:28.290 --> 00:53:30.750
The other atom is
not de-exciting.

00:53:30.750 --> 00:53:32.550
It's not removing the energy.

00:53:32.550 --> 00:53:34.910
But after the
collision, the atom

00:53:34.910 --> 00:53:40.440
continues to oscillate, but with
a very, very different phase.

00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:44.780
And sort of what I assumed
here is this time where

00:53:44.780 --> 00:53:48.540
the collision happens
is very short.

00:53:48.540 --> 00:53:51.480
It's a very short
collision time.

00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:54.850
That I can approximate
the collisions

00:53:54.850 --> 00:53:59.540
as simply imparting random
phase jumps to the atom.

00:54:02.440 --> 00:54:05.240
Well, if you ask,
what is the widths

00:54:05.240 --> 00:54:09.830
of the spectroscopic line,
it's exactly the same result.

00:54:12.350 --> 00:54:14.710
It just means we have
a different rate.

00:54:14.710 --> 00:54:18.420
It's now a de-phasing
rate, which is 1 over tau.

00:54:18.420 --> 00:54:20.370
And this is added to the
spectroscopic widths.

00:54:26.830 --> 00:54:27.850
OK.

00:54:27.850 --> 00:54:33.340
This is sort of just creating
some phenomenological picture.

00:54:33.340 --> 00:54:37.116
Let's now ask a little
bit more microscopically.

00:54:39.630 --> 00:54:40.683
How can it happen?

00:54:47.540 --> 00:54:53.250
How can it happen that there
is a phase change, that there's

00:54:53.250 --> 00:54:57.910
a change in the phase of
the atomic oscillator?

00:54:57.910 --> 00:55:02.470
And this leads us now to
consider the interaction

00:55:02.470 --> 00:55:08.680
potential as a function
of r between two atoms.

00:55:08.680 --> 00:55:14.240
We have one atom which is
sort of our active atom, which

00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:18.110
has an excited and ground state.

00:55:18.110 --> 00:55:21.475
And this atom is now
getting closer to,

00:55:21.475 --> 00:55:24.840
let's say, an argon atom,
which acts as buffer gas.

00:55:24.840 --> 00:55:27.450
And what I'm plotting
in this graph now

00:55:27.450 --> 00:55:32.830
is the interaction potential
between our light-emitting,

00:55:32.830 --> 00:55:35.970
or light-absorbing, atoms
and the buffer gas atom.

00:55:35.970 --> 00:55:38.090
And let's just
genetically assume there

00:55:38.090 --> 00:55:40.140
is sort of something like
a molecular potential.

00:55:44.220 --> 00:55:48.840
But in general, the
molecular potentials

00:55:48.840 --> 00:55:51.070
will be different in the
ground and excited state.

00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:56.850
And of course, if you
do hyperfine transitions

00:55:56.850 --> 00:55:58.750
between atoms in a
Bose-Einstein condensate,

00:55:58.750 --> 00:56:00.200
you may have a
scattering length,

00:56:00.200 --> 00:56:02.170
which is different
in the two states.

00:56:02.170 --> 00:56:04.010
And I think you
see the connection.

00:56:04.010 --> 00:56:07.364
So in general, if the
interaction environment

00:56:07.364 --> 00:56:09.280
is different between
ground and excited state,

00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:11.210
we expect that the
interaction potential

00:56:11.210 --> 00:56:13.670
causes certain shifts.

00:56:13.670 --> 00:56:27.860
So we could use the picture
that we have a phase evolution.

00:56:27.860 --> 00:56:30.910
And the phase evolution
is a frequency difference

00:56:30.910 --> 00:56:35.580
which is simply given by
the difference of the two

00:56:35.580 --> 00:56:38.440
potentials.

00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:40.650
So the picture is a little
bit-- which is actually

00:56:40.650 --> 00:56:43.530
very valid for cold
collisions, which-- well,

00:56:43.530 --> 00:56:45.580
really a new chapter
in atomic physics

00:56:45.580 --> 00:56:49.260
opened up by laser cooling
and magneto-optic traps.

00:56:49.260 --> 00:56:51.570
An atom, when it emits a
photon, would emit here

00:56:51.570 --> 00:56:53.290
at the resonance frequency.

00:56:53.290 --> 00:56:56.170
But if the collision
is very, very slow,

00:56:56.170 --> 00:56:59.990
it will actually emit,
with a certain probability,

00:56:59.990 --> 00:57:04.130
a photon which is shifted
by exactly this expression.

00:57:04.130 --> 00:57:07.200
And in that limit, that
could be very interesting,

00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:08.760
because by analyzing
the spectrum

00:57:08.760 --> 00:57:10.780
of the immediate light,
you learn something

00:57:10.780 --> 00:57:12.655
about the interaction
potential of two atoms.

00:57:15.530 --> 00:57:24.330
But of course, this argument
has a little bit of a flaw,

00:57:24.330 --> 00:57:29.493
because you can observe a
frequency not instantaneously.

00:57:37.335 --> 00:57:55.060
You can observe-- if a
collision happens very fast,

00:57:55.060 --> 00:57:59.690
you would actually go through
those frequency changes so fast

00:57:59.690 --> 00:58:01.120
that you cannot resolve them.

00:58:01.120 --> 00:58:04.160
The question is,
which one is larger?

00:58:04.160 --> 00:58:10.290
So if the frequency
shift is larger

00:58:10.290 --> 00:58:16.250
than the inverse time for the
duration of the collision,

00:58:16.250 --> 00:58:17.250
then you can observe it.

00:58:17.250 --> 00:58:19.180
Otherwise, you can't.

00:58:19.180 --> 00:58:22.420
So the picture we should
draw is now the following.

00:58:22.420 --> 00:58:24.230
And this is sort of
a microscopic picture

00:58:24.230 --> 00:58:27.070
on those phase jumps,
which I mentioned earlier.

00:58:27.070 --> 00:58:29.280
That you have your
atomic oscillator.

00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:30.860
The atom is oscillating.

00:58:30.860 --> 00:58:33.400
But now it comes
close to another atom.

00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:37.260
And let's assume there
is an energy increase

00:58:37.260 --> 00:58:39.630
between ground and excited
state due to the presence

00:58:39.630 --> 00:58:40.970
of the buffer gas atom.

00:58:40.970 --> 00:58:44.180
Then you would say you
get a quick oscillation.

00:58:44.180 --> 00:58:46.340
Depending on the
impact parameter,

00:58:46.340 --> 00:58:49.980
it can last various
amount of time.

00:58:49.980 --> 00:58:52.230
And then later, the
oscillation starts.

00:58:52.230 --> 00:58:55.485
But essentially, this
causes a random phase jump.

00:59:00.710 --> 00:59:03.380
So this time here is the
collision time tau c.

00:59:19.820 --> 00:59:34.030
What we expect now is we
have to now interpolate

00:59:34.030 --> 00:59:36.080
between two models.

00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:39.360
I'm not taking it any
further than that.

00:59:39.360 --> 00:59:44.130
We have an interesting
line shape.

00:59:44.130 --> 00:59:48.880
There may be a central part
which is simply collisionally

00:59:48.880 --> 00:59:54.780
broadened by the
interruptions of the phase,

00:59:54.780 --> 00:59:57.980
by the number of collisions
with the collision time tau.

01:00:03.310 --> 01:00:12.040
But if when the atoms collide,
there is a huge frequency shift

01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:19.230
momentarily, that this will
actually affect the wings.

01:00:19.230 --> 01:00:23.540
So for frequency shifts which
come from the interaction

01:00:23.540 --> 01:00:29.840
potential which are much
larger than the collision time,

01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:34.560
than the time
between collisions,

01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:38.260
we will observe
something which goes

01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:42.580
by the name "far
wing broadening."

01:00:42.580 --> 01:00:46.580
And also, the central part
of the potential is simply,

01:00:46.580 --> 01:00:50.647
you can say, it's a
Lorentzian which is simply

01:00:50.647 --> 01:00:51.980
broadened by the collision rate.

01:00:51.980 --> 01:00:54.160
There is no microscopic
information--

01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:56.070
what is the nature,
what is going on

01:00:56.070 --> 01:00:57.660
during the phase jumps.

01:00:57.660 --> 01:01:00.634
The wings will have
actually information

01:01:00.634 --> 01:01:01.883
about the molecular potential.

01:01:15.710 --> 01:01:18.680
And I just wanted to present
it to you in this way

01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:21.480
to sort of show how you
actually have, in a line shape,

01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:22.980
often two effects.

01:01:22.980 --> 01:01:25.850
One is pretty much
just the interruption

01:01:25.850 --> 01:01:28.990
of the coherence which
gives the central line.

01:01:28.990 --> 01:01:32.070
But you still have, at
least in some limit,

01:01:32.070 --> 01:01:36.100
information about what
causes those phase jumps.

01:01:36.100 --> 01:01:39.770
And this appears in the wings.

01:01:39.770 --> 01:01:42.440
20 years ago in the
atomic physics course,

01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:45.550
we taught you a theory
how to describe that.

01:01:45.550 --> 01:01:47.990
It could be probably
taught in one hour.

01:01:47.990 --> 01:01:49.750
There are some
links on the Wiki,

01:01:49.750 --> 01:01:52.780
but I don't want to
carry that further.

01:01:52.780 --> 01:01:55.114
Any questions about that?

01:01:55.114 --> 01:01:57.030
AUDIENCE: So why has the
importance decreased?

01:02:05.191 --> 01:02:07.020
PROFESSOR: The
importance has decreased

01:02:07.020 --> 01:02:08.965
of that, because
I mean, who of you

01:02:08.965 --> 01:02:12.280
is studying atoms and gas cells?

01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:13.380
Nobody.

01:02:13.380 --> 01:02:15.030
The frontier has moved on.

01:02:15.030 --> 01:02:17.300
We are much more in a
regime where we are not

01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:19.940
observing atoms in
certain environment.

01:02:19.940 --> 01:02:23.510
We are creating an interesting
system out of atoms

01:02:23.510 --> 01:02:26.445
by putting the atoms in a
well-defined environment where

01:02:26.445 --> 01:02:28.940
those things are absent.

01:02:28.940 --> 01:02:31.820
Or in the ultra-cold
domain, and de Broglie

01:02:31.820 --> 01:02:36.270
wavelengths is so long that this
kind of model for collisions

01:02:36.270 --> 01:02:38.000
is no longer applicable.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:41.250
We are in the extreme case of
a single partial wave, where

01:02:41.250 --> 01:02:43.320
a single parameter,
the scattering lengths,

01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:44.840
describes all of it.

01:02:49.111 --> 01:02:49.610
OK.

01:02:59.355 --> 01:02:59.855
Cory?

01:02:59.855 --> 01:03:00.648
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:03:00.648 --> 01:03:03.038
Could you talk for a
little bit about how

01:03:03.038 --> 01:03:05.428
this model of collisions
breaks down and allows

01:03:05.428 --> 01:03:08.236
for Dicke narrowing?

01:03:08.236 --> 01:03:09.610
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:03:09.610 --> 01:03:10.310
Thank you.

01:03:10.310 --> 01:03:12.660
That was one comment I forgot.

01:03:12.660 --> 01:03:17.360
What happens is you have Dicke--
thanks for this question.

01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:21.370
You have Dicke-- I drew up
the two potential curves.

01:03:21.370 --> 01:03:25.310
If the two potential curves
are absolutely identical,

01:03:25.310 --> 01:03:28.812
the atoms can approach
each other and can collide.

01:03:28.812 --> 01:03:30.270
But there is never
any perturbation

01:03:30.270 --> 01:03:33.270
to the atomic oscillator,
because the frequency

01:03:33.270 --> 01:03:36.480
between ground and
excited state is omega 0,

01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:39.682
no matter whether the atom
undergoes a collision or not.

01:03:39.682 --> 01:03:46.140
In this limit, which is
often realized in collisions

01:03:46.140 --> 01:03:48.550
with rare gases,
in this limit, you

01:03:48.550 --> 01:03:52.140
do not have any phase
interruption by the collision.

01:03:52.140 --> 01:03:54.490
And this is the prerequisite
for Dicke narrowing.

01:03:59.170 --> 01:03:59.670
OK.

01:03:59.670 --> 01:04:02.070
I think we have the
full picture now.

01:04:02.070 --> 01:04:05.915
And that means we can move
on to two-photon excitations.

01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:15.600
So whenever you
start a new chapter,

01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:17.050
you should motivate it.

01:04:17.050 --> 01:04:21.270
And the question is, why
should you be interested?

01:04:21.270 --> 01:04:24.270
Well, I can also turn it
around and said, why not?

01:04:24.270 --> 01:04:26.250
Because those things happen.

01:04:26.250 --> 01:04:29.430
And if those things happen,
we want to learn about them.

01:04:29.430 --> 01:04:32.060
And they actually
happen very naturally.

01:04:32.060 --> 01:04:34.960
The moment you go to
higher laser power

01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:37.820
and you go beyond the lowest
order of perturbation theory,

01:04:37.820 --> 01:04:41.730
you may actually excite two
photons at the same time.

01:04:41.730 --> 01:04:44.060
And actually, what we just
discussed about the emission

01:04:44.060 --> 01:04:48.150
spectrum of an atom, with the
sidebands, with the broadening,

01:04:48.150 --> 01:04:51.080
these are actually
examples where we really

01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:54.000
have to think about it in
a two-photon picture, not

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.050
a single-photon picture.

01:05:00.886 --> 01:05:05.240
The second motivation
is very practical.

01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:09.770
We may want to excite an
atom from a low-lying level

01:05:09.770 --> 01:05:11.180
to a high-lying level.

01:05:11.180 --> 01:05:14.700
But the only laser we can
buy, or the only laser we have

01:05:14.700 --> 01:05:17.600
in the laboratory
has lower frequency.

01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:19.190
That doesn't mean
that the case is

01:05:19.190 --> 01:05:22.890
lost by just stacking two
photons on top of each other.

01:05:22.890 --> 01:05:25.340
We can bridge the
gap and still excite

01:05:25.340 --> 01:05:28.580
the atom, which has
transitions only far in the UV.

01:05:28.580 --> 01:05:30.390
And all we have is
these visible lasers.

01:05:32.970 --> 01:05:35.680
There's another
thing which changes.

01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:40.850
Maybe we want to excite hydrogen
from the 1s to the 2s level.

01:05:40.850 --> 01:05:43.230
1s and 2s have the same parity.

01:05:43.230 --> 01:05:46.260
And if we try to excite
it with one photon,

01:05:46.260 --> 01:05:50.040
because of the dipole
operator which has odd parity,

01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:51.960
this is not allowed.

01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:54.040
So there are maybe
selection rules

01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:57.250
where we can go to
desirable final state

01:05:57.250 --> 01:06:00.790
only with two photons
and not with one photon.

01:06:12.730 --> 01:06:21.990
Finally, I will show you
on Wednesday-- remember,

01:06:21.990 --> 01:06:25.630
there is no class on Monday,
because the whole CUA

01:06:25.630 --> 01:06:29.610
will go crazy with the NSF
site visit on Monday, Tuesday.

01:06:29.610 --> 01:06:31.216
So the next class on Wednesday.

01:06:31.216 --> 01:06:32.590
And on Wednesday,
I will actually

01:06:32.590 --> 01:06:38.030
show you if the two photons come
from counter-propagating beams,

01:06:38.030 --> 01:06:41.020
the net momentum transfer
to the atom is 0.

01:06:41.020 --> 01:06:45.050
And net momentum transfer of
0 means zero Doppler shift.

01:06:45.050 --> 01:06:48.470
So two photons give
us an opportunity,

01:06:48.470 --> 01:06:50.860
which doesn't exist
with the single photon.

01:06:50.860 --> 01:06:53.445
We can excite the atom
without transferring momentum.

01:06:56.220 --> 01:07:00.190
And this is the basis of a
Doppler free spectroscopy

01:07:00.190 --> 01:07:02.240
technique.

01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:05.350
And finally, for purely
conceptional reasons,

01:07:05.350 --> 01:07:08.140
we've talked so much about
excitation of an atom,

01:07:08.140 --> 01:07:11.410
and then ask, what is the
rate of light scattering?

01:07:11.410 --> 01:07:15.630
So we have actually used
two-photon processes

01:07:15.630 --> 01:07:18.606
in the course many, many
times without actually

01:07:18.606 --> 01:07:19.730
adequately addressing them.

01:07:23.865 --> 01:07:25.240
I didn't tell you
anything wrong.

01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:27.050
I was sort of choosing
my words carefully,

01:07:27.050 --> 01:07:29.840
that everything I told you about
light emission and absorption

01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:32.520
is comparable with
the correct picture.

01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:35.140
And the correct picture
is if a photon goes in

01:07:35.140 --> 01:07:37.650
and a photon goes out,
you have to describe it

01:07:37.650 --> 01:07:41.050
as one process
involving two photons.

01:07:41.050 --> 01:07:43.840
So I think we have
enough reasons why

01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:47.790
we should be interested.

01:07:47.790 --> 01:07:54.200
And if I take this picture,
that I start in one state

01:07:54.200 --> 01:08:06.720
and have a two-photon
absorption process,

01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:13.110
I actually want to
redraw it, because

01:08:13.110 --> 01:08:17.560
in the dipole approximation,
which I want to use here,

01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:23.979
we have the dipole operator,
and second quantization

01:08:23.979 --> 01:08:25.490
is a plus a dagger.

01:08:25.490 --> 01:08:28.090
The electric field
is a plus a dagger.

01:08:28.090 --> 01:08:31.090
So each application
of the operator

01:08:31.090 --> 01:08:35.560
takes us from one state to
the next with a single photon.

01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:40.430
So therefore, if you
talk about two photons,

01:08:40.430 --> 01:08:48.870
we can only absorb
them if we have

01:08:48.870 --> 01:08:54.050
an intermediate state,
which I will call f.

01:08:54.050 --> 01:08:58.640
So we should really think
about two-photon absorption

01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:07.261
as a two-step process which
involves an intermediate state.

01:09:11.500 --> 01:09:13.510
And it has to be
like that if we want

01:09:13.510 --> 01:09:16.100
to use, as the
operator for atom light

01:09:16.100 --> 01:09:18.470
interaction, the
dipole operator,

01:09:18.470 --> 01:09:21.000
because a dipole
operator is creating

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.620
and-- the dipole operator
involves electric field.

01:09:23.620 --> 01:09:27.850
And that creates or annihilates
one photon at a time.

01:09:27.850 --> 01:09:29.819
Let me just make a
side remark, but this

01:09:29.819 --> 01:09:32.229
will be addressed in 8.422.

01:09:32.229 --> 01:09:35.330
If you use the description
of the interaction

01:09:35.330 --> 01:09:37.189
with the electromagnetic
field, which

01:09:37.189 --> 01:09:44.260
is the p minus e Hamiltonian,
and you square it,

01:09:44.260 --> 01:09:48.240
if you square that, you
get an A squared term.

01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:51.550
The A squared term is
actually the product

01:09:51.550 --> 01:09:54.580
of a plus a dagger squared.

01:09:54.580 --> 01:09:56.980
So you can actually,
with the A squared term,

01:09:56.980 --> 01:10:02.740
scatter two photons by going
from one state to another one.

01:10:02.740 --> 01:10:06.060
But I'm not discussing it here.

01:10:06.060 --> 01:10:10.690
And I leave a detailed
comparison and discussion

01:10:10.690 --> 01:10:13.120
of that to 8.422.

01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:16.030
Now we are strictly adhering
to the dipole approximation.

01:10:16.030 --> 01:10:17.940
Oh, actually, let me
make a comment about it,

01:10:17.940 --> 01:10:22.220
because I just realized if I
say something and don't say it

01:10:22.220 --> 01:10:24.080
fully, I may confuse people.

01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:27.730
So what I want to say is,
we will show, in 8.422

01:10:27.730 --> 01:10:31.350
that the two pictures, the
pap minus a Hamiltonian

01:10:31.350 --> 01:10:35.780
and the dipole Hamiltonian
are equivalent.

01:10:35.780 --> 01:10:39.670
They're connected by
canonical transformation.

01:10:39.670 --> 01:10:43.720
So therefore, it is not a
fundamental aspect of nature,

01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:45.920
whether you can scatter
only one photon when

01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:48.140
you go from one
state to the other.

01:10:48.140 --> 01:10:50.200
There are two
equivalent descriptions.

01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:52.790
In one description, you
sometimes scatter two photons.

01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:55.330
In the other description,
you scatter only one photon.

01:10:55.330 --> 01:10:57.830
And you will all
get a PSET in 8.422

01:10:57.830 --> 01:11:00.860
where you show for one
example that the results are

01:11:00.860 --> 01:11:04.500
the same when you sum up
over all possibilities.

01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:06.790
So therefore, I can
maybe here should rather

01:11:06.790 --> 01:11:11.400
take the position, the generic
description of light scattering

01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:13.440
uses the dipole approximation.

01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:16.170
And in the dipole
approximation, we

01:11:16.170 --> 01:11:18.860
are describing the
atoms, that they only

01:11:18.860 --> 01:11:22.510
exchange one photon when they
go from one state to the next.

01:11:22.510 --> 01:11:26.190
And this is a full description
but not the only description.

01:11:28.900 --> 01:11:33.020
So therefore, we need
an intermediate state.

01:11:33.020 --> 01:11:36.170
But assuming that the
first laser is not

01:11:36.170 --> 01:11:39.420
resonant with the transition
to the intermediate state,

01:11:39.420 --> 01:11:42.000
we need this dashed line.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:46.820
This dashed line is sometimes
called a virtual state.

01:11:46.820 --> 01:11:49.485
And in the following
discussion, we

01:11:49.485 --> 01:11:52.570
will really learn what is the
nature of the virtual state

01:11:52.570 --> 01:11:54.750
and what does it mean.

01:11:54.750 --> 01:12:00.680
But we need a stepping stone
for a two-photon process

01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:02.584
in the form of
intermediate states.

01:12:08.430 --> 01:12:12.750
So maybe I should
just use three minutes

01:12:12.750 --> 01:12:15.650
and show you how you
would calculate it.

01:12:15.650 --> 01:12:18.117
I use pre-written
slides here, because I'm

01:12:18.117 --> 01:12:20.075
getting a little bit
bored of just writing down

01:12:20.075 --> 01:12:23.230
the same or similar
perturbative expressions.

01:12:23.230 --> 01:12:25.600
And I just step you through.

01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:31.260
So I said we use
the dipole operator.

01:12:31.260 --> 01:12:33.390
But now-- and this
is a new thing--

01:12:33.390 --> 01:12:35.650
the electric field
has not only one

01:12:35.650 --> 01:12:37.470
component and one frequency.

01:12:37.470 --> 01:12:40.270
We want to look at two
photons, so therefore, it

01:12:40.270 --> 01:12:42.520
has two frequencies.

01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:44.940
So therefore, our
perturbation Hamiltonian

01:12:44.940 --> 01:12:48.100
is what we had so far
for monochromatic field.

01:12:48.100 --> 01:12:50.450
But then we have
an additional term

01:12:50.450 --> 01:12:53.630
where we just change the
index from one to two

01:12:53.630 --> 01:12:57.710
to have the second
laser field described.

01:12:57.710 --> 01:13:01.910
So let me now introduce
matrix elements.

01:13:01.910 --> 01:13:12.170
We have to go from state a
to some intermediate state.

01:13:12.170 --> 01:13:15.080
And then we go to state b.

01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:16.980
So therefore, we
need matrix elements

01:13:16.980 --> 01:13:20.870
which take us from
state a to state f.

01:13:20.870 --> 01:13:25.720
And again, we have two
such possibilities--

01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:28.410
one at omega 1,
one at omega 2, one

01:13:28.410 --> 01:13:32.175
driven by field 1, the
other one driven by field 2.

01:13:36.140 --> 01:13:41.530
And yeah, we all have
the counter-rotating and

01:13:41.530 --> 01:13:42.280
co-rotating terms.

01:13:46.010 --> 01:13:49.860
What happens is we have, of
course, a complex conjugate.

01:13:49.860 --> 01:13:53.290
But I told you
already several times

01:13:53.290 --> 01:13:56.320
that there is an e
to the minus i omega

01:13:56.320 --> 01:13:58.530
1, which is responsible
for absorption.

01:13:58.530 --> 01:14:00.830
The plus i omega
1 does emission.

01:14:00.830 --> 01:14:04.090
And let me just-- I want
to do the rotating wave

01:14:04.090 --> 01:14:06.500
approximation, only
keep the relevant term.

01:14:06.500 --> 01:14:08.900
So I look at
two-photon absorption.

01:14:08.900 --> 01:14:12.290
And that means I only keep
forward the minus terms.

01:14:12.290 --> 01:14:15.690
You could, if you
want, duplicate

01:14:15.690 --> 01:14:17.750
the lengths of each
formula and carry forward

01:14:17.750 --> 01:14:18.940
the counter-rotating term.

01:14:18.940 --> 01:14:20.450
You're not learning
anything new.

01:14:20.450 --> 01:14:21.825
You get additional
Bloch-Siegerts

01:14:21.825 --> 01:14:23.100
and AC stark shifts.

01:14:23.100 --> 01:14:28.180
This is not the new feature
I want to implement.

01:14:28.180 --> 01:14:30.480
So let's focus on
the new aspect.

01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:31.930
And this is the following.

01:14:31.930 --> 01:14:34.880
We do first-order
perturbation theory,

01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:38.210
which takes us in the first
step to the intermediate state.

01:14:38.210 --> 01:14:42.290
And you have seen this
expression many, many times.

01:14:42.290 --> 01:14:46.860
The only thing is in addition to
what we had for one laser beam,

01:14:46.860 --> 01:14:50.158
we have to add a second
possibility, which

01:14:50.158 --> 01:14:51.324
comes from the second field.

01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:57.630
And now we are at the
intermediate step.

01:14:57.630 --> 01:15:00.900
And we want to take the second
step to the final state.

01:15:00.900 --> 01:15:03.940
So what we are now doing is we
are writing down Schrodinger's

01:15:03.940 --> 01:15:06.410
equation, derivative
of the wave function

01:15:06.410 --> 01:15:09.410
is Hamiltonian times
the wave function.

01:15:09.410 --> 01:15:11.450
And we are especially
interested in how

01:15:11.450 --> 01:15:16.930
do we accumulate probability or
amplitude in the final state.

01:15:16.930 --> 01:15:21.200
But what we are doing is
on the right-hand side,

01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:23.090
because we can't start
in the ground state,

01:15:23.090 --> 01:15:24.870
we've gone to the
intermediate state,

01:15:24.870 --> 01:15:28.040
we are now plugging in
the previous result,

01:15:28.040 --> 01:15:31.530
the first-order result for
the intermediate state.

01:15:31.530 --> 01:15:34.212
So therefore, by using
second-order perturbation

01:15:34.212 --> 01:15:36.420
theory, we want the second-order
perturbation theory,

01:15:36.420 --> 01:15:39.660
so we integrate this equation
with respect to time.

01:15:39.660 --> 01:15:43.450
But on the right side, we
use our first-order result,

01:15:43.450 --> 01:15:46.900
which we had derived earlier.

01:15:46.900 --> 01:15:49.180
And then we just write
down the integral.

01:15:49.180 --> 01:15:51.780
Everything is just
exponential function.

01:15:51.780 --> 01:15:53.910
And we get the result here.

01:15:53.910 --> 01:16:04.770
So now with two steps, we
have obtained an expression

01:16:04.770 --> 01:16:08.650
for-- I know time
is over, but let

01:16:08.650 --> 01:16:10.790
me just finish the argument.

01:16:10.790 --> 01:16:13.280
So we have now an expression
in second-order perturbation

01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:14.260
theory.

01:16:14.260 --> 01:16:17.150
What is the amplitude
in the final state?

01:16:17.150 --> 01:16:19.150
And things look a
little bit messy,

01:16:19.150 --> 01:16:21.230
because we have four terms.

01:16:21.230 --> 01:16:23.430
And we should get
four terms, because we

01:16:23.430 --> 01:16:24.930
have two interactions.

01:16:24.930 --> 01:16:27.480
We can take one
photon of one laser

01:16:27.480 --> 01:16:30.870
beam-- first step, omega
1; second step, omega two.

01:16:30.870 --> 01:16:32.960
We can switch the
order of photons.

01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:35.560
And of course, if you write
down everything correctly,

01:16:35.560 --> 01:16:38.600
nothing is forbidding the atom
of taking both photons out

01:16:38.600 --> 01:16:40.912
of the same laser beam.

01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:50.350
Yeah, let me stop here.
