00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.490
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.460
Back to cavity QED, back to
the fully quantized radiation

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.125
field, back to vacuum
Rabi oscillation.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.730
Let me just recapitulate and
sort of make the transition

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.650
from this intense
discussion about homework

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.560
to the intellectually
stimulating discussion

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.060
about atoms and photons.

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.490
So in the semiclassical
description

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.230
of the electromagnetic
field, photons

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.450
can only be emitted
because we have

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.310
a Hamiltonian with the
semiclassical electric field.

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:08.130
So if you don't drive the
system with an electric field,

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.090
you cannot stimulate
the emission of photons.

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.200
But we know this is
not what happens.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.630
Photons are emitted
into empty space,

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.690
photons are emitted
into a vacuum.

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.340
And for that we needed
a quantized description

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.940
of the electromagnetic field.

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.120
We did field
quantization, and we

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.170
have now our
quantized Hamiltonian.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.210
And on Monday I
started to discuss

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.285
what is sort of the
paradigmatic situation,

00:01:35.285 --> 00:01:39.030
the paradigmatic example,
for how you should think

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.910
about the vacuum and how you
should think about emission

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:43.710
of photons into the vacuum.

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.880
And these are the
vacuum Rabi oscillation

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.780
described by the
Jaynes-Cummings model.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.635
So the situation
which I have in mind,

00:01:52.635 --> 00:01:54.010
or which you should
have in mind,

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.370
is an idealized
situation, but it

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:00.450
has been realized
experimentally.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.130
And some of those
idealized experiments

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.620
were recognized
with the Nobel Prize

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.310
research of Haroche
and Dave Wineland.

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.039
So the situation
is we have an atom,

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.610
but it only talks to one mode
of the electromagnetic field,

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.340
and we make sure
that the atom only

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.580
talks to one mode of the
electromagnetic field

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.980
not by eliminating
other modes; they exist.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.460
I mean, an atom can emit
upwards and downwards.

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:32.340
But we surround it with a cavity
which has such a small mode

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.460
volume, it has such a small
volume, that the single photon

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.620
Rabi frequency is
huge, and therefore

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.410
the emission into
this one single mode

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.970
dominates over the emission
into all other modes.

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.410
So this is a condition that the
single photon Rabi frequency

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.830
has to be larger than gamma.

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.900
And, of course, we
also have to make sure

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.840
that the system is idealized
so the loss of photons because

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.240
of losses in the mirror,
or finite reflectivity

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.060
in the mirror, also
has to be smaller.

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.200
So that means for
several Rabi periods

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.600
we have a system which has only
two parts, a two-level atom

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.740
and one single
mode of the cavity.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.810
So that's the system
we have in mind,

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.580
and we discussed
the Hamiltonian.

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:34.320
We saw that the Hilbert
space of the atom

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.020
is excited in ground state, the
Hilbert space of the photons

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:42.157
is spent by the
[? flux ?] states,

00:03:42.157 --> 00:03:44.740
but what happens is-- so there's
an infinite number of states,

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.770
because of the infinite number
of states of the photon field--

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:53.710
but what happens is the
Hamiltonian couples only

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:57.540
an excited state with n photons
to a ground state with n

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.080
plus 1 photons.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.890
So the whole Hilbert
space is segmented now

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:09.250
into just pairs of states
labeled by the index n.

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:15.320
So after so much work, we are
back to a two-level system.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:19.810
And here is our
two-level Hamiltonian.

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.350
And, well, a
two-level system does

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.120
oscillations between
the two levels.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.220
Rabi oscillations, no surprise.

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.910
And this is what I
want to discuss now.

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:36.060
But the new feature is that
these are really, well,

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.950
these are now really two levels.

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.910
Each of them is
the combined state

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.620
of the atom and the
quantized radiation field.

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.950
So now we have included in
our two-level description

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.950
the quantum state of the
electromagnetic field.

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:08.930
So first you should realize that
this Hamiltonian is absolutely

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:13.540
identical to spn 1/2
in magnetic fields.

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:27.490
And you can recognize
by [? comparing ?]

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.740
this Hamiltonian, this
matrix, to the matrices

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:33.880
we discussed for spn 1/2
in the magnetic field,

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:39.720
that this corresponds
to the situation

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:44.540
where this spn 1/2
had a transverse field

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:49.520
in the x direction which
caused a precession from spn

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.310
up to spn down.

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.930
And this x component
of the field

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:58.700
corresponds now to the single
photon Rabi frequency times

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:59.880
n plus 1.

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.780
That's the off diagonal
matrix element in this matrix.

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:08.750
The thing which we
have to discuss,

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:12.330
and I will focus later,
is that it depends on n.

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:15.970
So for each pairs of state
labeled by n, the photon

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:21.530
number, we have a different
off diagonal matrix element.

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:27.600
But let's discuss first the most
important and simplest case.

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:32.640
Let's assume we
are on resonance,

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:42.520
and we want to assume
that we have a vacuum.

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:51.070
Then our Hamiltonian
is simply this.

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:56.690
And when we prepare the system
in an initial state, which

00:06:56.690 --> 00:07:06.250
is an excited state with
no photon in the vacuum,

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:11.180
then we'll have
oscillations to the ground

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:12.120
state with one photon.

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.740
These oscillations are
exactly the oscillations

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:19.262
we saw on the spn 1/2 system.

00:07:19.262 --> 00:07:20.470
We can just map the solution.

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:23.640
I'm not really
writing anything here.

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:28.750
So what we obtain is the famous
vacuum Rabi oscillations.

00:07:31.274 --> 00:07:38.220
where the probability to
be in the excited state

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:46.100
oscillates with the single
photon Rabi frequency omega 1.

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:48.940
I think there's a little bit
of an ambiguity in language.

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:50.985
Is it the single
photon Rabi frequency?

00:07:50.985 --> 00:07:53.700
or is it the vacuum
Rabi frequency?

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:56.580
Because there's always
the question about plus

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:59.010
minus one photon because
we start in the excited

00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:01.170
state without photon
so you want to say

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:02.980
it's a vacuum Rabi frequency.

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:05.850
But then you have the ground
state with one photon,

00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:08.040
and this photon is
reabsorbed and then

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:10.840
you may want to call it the
one photon Rabi frequency.

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:15.060
So I leave it to you, but it's
called vacuum Rabi oscillation

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:18.710
and this Rabi frequency is
usually referred to as the one

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:21.860
photon Rabi frequency
because we obtained the Rabi

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:24.889
frequency by calculating
the electric field

00:08:24.889 --> 00:08:25.680
of a single photon.

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:34.140
So the Rabi oscillations
which we are observing now

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:40.130
correspond to the periodic
spontaneous emission

00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:43.370
and re-absorption
of the same photon.

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:46.430
There's only one photon
which is spontaneously

00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:51.450
emitted and reabsorbed in
a completely reversible

00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:54.560
coherent way, and the
time evolution is unitary.

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:22.390
So it's a periodic
spontaneous emission

00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:25.180
and re-absorption
of the same photon.

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:40.595
This has been
experimentally observed.

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:45.280
Actually, let me back up.

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:51.875
Experiments are done in
the microwave regime.

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:58.460
The leading groups are,
well, in the older days,

00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:00.030
Dan Kleppner, Herbert
[? Weidner, ?]

00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:02.000
and Serge Haroche.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.830
And this involves Rydberg atoms.

00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:13.685
Rydberg atoms in
superconducting high q cavities.

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:20.150
And those Rydberg
atoms, because things

00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:22.910
scale with n and n squared,
the principal quantum number,

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:24.860
have a fantastically
strong coupling

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:27.120
to the electromagnetic field.

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:29.130
And there is a
homework assignment

00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:32.580
on Rydberg atoms
in such cavities.

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:35.660
The other example is
in the optical domain.

00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:48.470
And this really involves
the D line of alkali atoms.

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:50.490
You drive them on the D line.

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:53.470
rubidium and caesium
are often used,

00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:56.490
and the work is enabled
by the development

00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:59.700
of so-called supermirrors
which have an extremely

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:05.360
high reflectivity, and you can
realize an excellent q factor.

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:09.560
And the leaders in this field
are Jeff Kimble and Gerhard

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:12.720
Rempe at the Max
Planck Institute.

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:17.230
So let me just
discuss an example

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:19.660
taken from the optical domain.

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:28.130
So the generic
situation is that you

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:35.410
have two mirrors which
define a single mode cavity.

00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:40.120
Usually, you have
a stream of atoms.

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:42.390
Traditionally in
atomic beams, then

00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:46.230
in some experiments in slowed
atomic beams, more recently

00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:49.260
in atoms which are
falling out off the mode,

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:52.870
and only very recently
single atoms with the help

00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:56.550
of other laser beams that are
trapped inside the cavity.

00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:58.590
So they are streamed
in such a way

00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:03.630
that only one or a few atoms
are in the mode volume interact

00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:06.800
with a single mode of the
cavity at a given time.

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:12.270
And then you want to figure
out what is now happening,

00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:17.790
and you have the probe laser,
you send it through the cavity,

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:23.260
and then you record the
transmission with a photodiode.

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:23.982
Yanosh?

00:12:23.982 --> 00:12:28.320
AUDIENCE: What is the mirror
made of for the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:31.320
PROFESSOR: The mirror is
made of a glass substrate,

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:33.500
but then you would
[INAUDIBLE] the coating.

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:36.110
And the mastering is
really to put coatings

00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:39.310
on which are very
pure, but then also I

00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:43.150
think using ion
sputtering, you make

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:45.750
sure that the coating
is extremely smooth

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:48.930
and does not have any
surface irregularities which

00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:52.130
would scatter a tiny
fraction of the light.

00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:55.030
I know there are some people
in Ike's group and [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:56.760
group who work with
high q mirrors.

00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:00.280
What is a typical example
for the reflectivity?

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:02.146
Or the q factor you can reach?

00:13:02.146 --> 00:13:07.006
AUDIENCE: 5 [INAUDIBLE] and
a finesse of, maybe, 500,000.

00:13:07.006 --> 00:13:09.440
And they're called
superpolished mirrors.

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:12.110
PROFESSOR: So finesse of
about a million, and that

00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:16.480
means the mirrors have
99.9999% reflectivity.

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:20.140
And the superpolishing, I
think, that was the last step.

00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:22.100
People had controlled
the materials,

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:24.810
but then they found ways
to make a super polish

00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:27.830
and avoid these even
one part per million

00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:31.184
scattering by surface roughness.

00:13:33.741 --> 00:13:34.240
OK.

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:37.590
So if you do that experiment,
what would you expect?

00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:40.250
Well, it's a
[INAUDIBLE] experiment

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:46.440
so if you would scan
the probe laser,

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:48.580
and there is nothing
in it, what you

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:54.610
would expect is you would
just expect a transmission

00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:57.180
peak at the cavity resonance.

00:13:57.180 --> 00:13:59.270
And if you tune
much further, you

00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:03.030
get the next peak at
the free spectral range.

00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:05.400
Let me just indicate that.

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:09.230
So this is a case for
0 atoms in the cavity.

00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:11.820
If you put 1 photon
in the cavity,

00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:14.770
you no longer-- sorry,
1 atom in the cavity,

00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:17.620
you're no longer
probing a cavity,

00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:19.790
you're really probing
a system, which

00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:21.510
is no longer the
cavity by itself.

00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:23.390
It's an atom-photon system.

00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:25.110
It's a couple system.

00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:28.580
And we know it's described by
our two-by-two Hamiltonian,

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:32.060
and this Hamiltonian
has two solutions.

00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:36.670
And the two solutions are
split by the one photon Rabi

00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:37.770
frequency.

00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:40.550
So the two eigenvalues
of our Hamiltonian

00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:46.100
are at plus minus
omega 1 photon.

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:50.730
So therefore, for n equals
1, we have a situation

00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:56.520
that we have two peaks split
by the single photon Rabi

00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:58.190
frequency.

00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:00.540
Of course, I have assumed
that great care has

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:04.570
been spent to make sure that
the cavity resonance is right

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:07.290
where the atomic resonance is.

00:15:07.290 --> 00:15:10.370
So this is now for 1.

00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:15.840
If you have 10 atoms, remember
the two-by-two Hamiltonian

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:19.920
looks the same, but it has the
square root n plus 1 factor.

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:24.150
So neglecting the 1 roughly when
we have 10 atoms in the cavity,

00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:27.980
it's square root 10
larger Rabi frequency.

00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:30.680
And therefore, we
would expect that we

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:34.390
have now a splitting
of the two modes, which

00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:37.110
is square root 10 plus 1 larger.

00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:46.220
Actually, I didn't-- sorry,
I have to collect myself now.

00:15:50.538 --> 00:15:54.200
I showed you that
the Rabi frequency

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:58.670
scales with square root n
plus 1 in the photon field.

00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:00.880
But you should realize
that everything

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:02.950
is [? isometric ?]
between photons and atoms.

00:16:02.950 --> 00:16:06.180
It's the complete coupling
between photons and atoms.

00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:10.110
And if you would now look--
but I don't want to do it now--

00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:13.530
if you would now look what
happens if several atoms are

00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:16.000
present in the mode
volume, you would also

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:21.450
get a scaling which is n
plus 1 in the atom number,

00:16:21.450 --> 00:16:23.840
because the atom
coupled coherently.

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:25.910
It is actually an effect
of super-radiance,

00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:27.380
which we'll discussed later.

00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:29.250
So just take my word.

00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:32.170
You have the same scaling
with the atom number.

00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:35.870
But I have to give you my word
now, because in the experiment

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:37.005
this is what people varied.

00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:44.280
AUDIENCE: If they had varied
power or number of photons

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:47.380
instead, like, we couldn't
have drawn these same diagrams,

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:47.880
right?

00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:52.906
Because then the top part
of the Lorentzian changes.

00:16:52.906 --> 00:16:57.840
If you're changing the photon
number then Lorentzians change.

00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:58.790
PROFESSOR: Say again?

00:16:58.790 --> 00:17:00.920
AUDIENCE: So, like,
right now, yes, we

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:02.760
are varying the
number of atoms so we

00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:04.930
can talk about the splitting.

00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:07.773
But if we were varying the
power or the number of photons

00:17:07.773 --> 00:17:09.942
instead, then each
of the Lorentzians,

00:17:09.942 --> 00:17:11.250
their height would change.

00:17:15.839 --> 00:17:17.806
How would you draw
this observation

00:17:17.806 --> 00:17:19.574
if you were changing
the photon numbers?

00:17:19.574 --> 00:17:21.960
PROFESSOR: You know, I don't
want to go into line shape.

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:24.410
I would probably
be a Lorentzian.

00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:25.829
I mean, all I want
to discuss here

00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:29.880
is that we have a two-by-two
Hamiltonian, which is split.

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:35.380
And if we have one
atom and one photon,

00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:38.270
it is split by the single
photon Rabi frequency.

00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:43.610
If we have one atom
and 10 photons,

00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:48.560
the atom can of course
absorb and emit only one.

00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:50.820
As I derived on
the previous page,

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:53.650
we would have now a Rabi
splitting, which is square root

00:17:53.650 --> 00:17:57.060
n plus 1, n being the
number of photons.

00:17:57.060 --> 00:18:00.290
But if you would start
in an empty cavity

00:18:00.290 --> 00:18:03.240
with 10 atoms in
the excited state,

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:05.600
because all the
atoms are identical,

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:08.410
they would spontaneously
emit together,

00:18:08.410 --> 00:18:10.880
and then you would have 10
atoms in the ground state,

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:13.050
and then you would
have 10 photons.

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:14.690
And so maybe this helps you.

00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:17.230
If you start with 10 atoms
in the excited state,

00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:18.520
they do everything together.

00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:21.240
If you have 10 atoms in the
ground state with 10 photons,

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:23.380
and now you have 10
photons and it's clear

00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:25.880
the 10 photons lead
to a Rabi frequency,

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:28.760
which is proportional
to the square root of 10

00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:31.000
or to the square root of 11.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.640
So therefore, what
you will observe

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:38.520
is you will now observe a
splitting of the single mode

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:44.329
of the cavity which goes by
the square root of n plus 1.

00:18:44.329 --> 00:18:46.870
I don't want to discuss the line
shape and the [? strings, ?]

00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:51.010
I just want to sort of discuss,
in a way, the eigenvalues

00:18:51.010 --> 00:18:53.660
of the Hamiltonian,
and the eigenvalues

00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:55.662
are the positions
of the transmission

00:18:55.662 --> 00:18:56.495
peaks with a cavity.

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:02.605
And that has been observed.

00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:09.490
I mentioned the two
leaders of the field

00:19:09.490 --> 00:19:11.030
are Gerhard Rempe
and Jeff Kimble.

00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:16.090
Well, Gerhard Rempe,
he did his Ph.D.

00:19:16.090 --> 00:19:17.680
In the same group
at the same time

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:19.560
as I did so I know
him very well.

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:21.964
Then he went and did post
doc work with Jeff Kimble,

00:19:21.964 --> 00:19:24.130
and now is the Director of
the Max Planck Institute.

00:19:24.130 --> 00:19:27.120
He has the world leading
group in cavity QED.

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:29.710
But this is sort of here
the two leaders have

00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:35.590
a joint paper, which is the
first observation of the vacuum

00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:38.090
Rabi splitting in
an optical cavity.

00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:41.970
Of course, you can
easily observe it

00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:44.960
if you have a strong atomic
bean with many atoms,

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:46.900
because then you
have a good signal.

00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:51.390
And secondly, the splitting
is large and easily resolved.

00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:55.120
So what they managed to do is
they managed to throttle down

00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:59.470
the atomic beam that fewer and
fewer atoms at the given time

00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:01.190
were in the cavity.

00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:07.970
And eventually they came down
to the limit of one atom.

00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:10.380
That was an historic experiment.

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:13.870
Of course, it's not
perfect in the sense

00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:18.640
that you do not see the deep
cut between the two peaks simply

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:21.910
because, when on average you
have one atom in the cavity,

00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:24.150
sometimes you have to
atom in the cavity,

00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:27.520
and then you have a
peak in the middle.

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:29.590
So those experiments
in those days

00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:31.900
were done only with
average atom numbers

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:35.440
and not with trapped atoms
where you know for sure there's

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:37.044
exactly one atom in the cavity.

00:20:51.701 --> 00:20:52.200
OK.

00:20:58.810 --> 00:21:02.500
So I don't show
you an experiment,

00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:11.090
but let me just state that
this sort of single photon Rabi

00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:15.115
flopping has been observed.

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:28.340
You start with the cavity
in the vacuum field,

00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:31.010
and you sort of see
this oscillation

00:21:31.010 --> 00:21:34.140
to the ground state
with one photon.

00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:40.170
But what I want to discuss
now is the situation

00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:44.500
that we are not starting
with an empty cavity.

00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:48.140
We are starting with
a coherent field.

00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:50.880
You can also start
with a thermal field

00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:54.820
so there are different
experiments you can do.

00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:56.260
What would we expect now?

00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:12.370
So now the initial
photon state is not

00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:20.490
the vacuum state, but
the thermal state.

00:22:20.490 --> 00:22:22.660
If you have a microwave
cavity and you heat it

00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:27.340
up a little bit, you have to
cool it down to below 1 Kelvin.

00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:30.970
People use either helium-free
chrio stats or dilution

00:22:30.970 --> 00:22:33.640
refrigerators, but if you
warm it up a little bit,

00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:36.180
you have a few microwave
photons in the cavity.

00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:39.780
Or, that's even more controlled,
you can make the cavity ice

00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:43.700
cold, but then you inject a few
photons from your synthesizer

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:45.690
into it-- from your
microwave generator--

00:22:45.690 --> 00:22:48.680
and then you have a
weak coherent field.

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:51.470
But a thermal state
or a coherent state.

00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:16.780
So what we then have is,
OK, we would expect now

00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:23.290
a Rabi oscillation; however, the
frequency for the Rabi flopping

00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:27.330
is now proportional to n plus 1.

00:23:27.330 --> 00:23:30.240
And we have our photon
field in the superposition

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:31.280
of flux states.

00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:45.410
So the fact that we have a
superposition state implies now

00:23:45.410 --> 00:23:58.540
that the Rabi oscillations
have a different oscillation

00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:07.970
frequency for the different
[? tablets ?] of states labeled

00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:09.720
by n.

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:11.690
And that leads to a dephasing.

00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:18.685
So that would mean that if you
would look at the probability

00:24:18.685 --> 00:24:23.140
to be in the excited
state-- just think about it.

00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:26.210
You have a wave function where
the atom starts in the excited

00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:29.520
state, and the photon field
is in a superposition.

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:32.720
So now you have a
two-component wave function

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:35.940
which has different
parts, and each part

00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:39.480
has a specific Rabi frequency.

00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:43.944
So you would have oscillations.

00:24:43.944 --> 00:24:45.610
Let's say there is a
certain probability

00:24:45.610 --> 00:24:47.600
that the cavity
is in the vacuum,

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:51.080
and then that means that there
is a component which oscillates

00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:53.980
at the vacuum Rabi
oscillation frequency.

00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:57.890
But if you have a
component in your coherent

00:24:57.890 --> 00:25:01.020
or thermal state which
has two photons in it,

00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:06.690
then you have Rabi
oscillations which are faster.

00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:09.370
And now you have to
superimpose them all.

00:25:09.370 --> 00:25:11.580
And if you all
superimpose them, and you

00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:16.290
find that very soon there
is a damping and maybe

00:25:16.290 --> 00:25:18.360
a little bit of
vigor, but you see

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:27.403
at damping of the population
in the excited state.

00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:32.790
Q [? 2 ?] dephasing.

00:25:32.790 --> 00:25:33.720
I'm just hesitating.

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:36.290
I think I took this
plot out of my notes,

00:25:36.290 --> 00:25:39.050
but I would expect now the
damping should actually

00:25:39.050 --> 00:25:43.040
lead to a probability to be
in the excited state of 1/2.

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:46.720
So let me just try
to correct that.

00:25:49.330 --> 00:25:51.576
So there is a little
bit of oscillation,

00:25:51.576 --> 00:25:53.075
but then there is
sort of a damping.

00:25:58.070 --> 00:26:12.710
And eventually, if you
have only a small number

00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:15.060
of photon states,
then there will

00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:18.850
be a time where you
have sort of at least

00:26:18.850 --> 00:26:20.930
a partial commensurability.

00:26:20.930 --> 00:26:22.580
You have maybe five frequencies.

00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:25.690
You know, square root 5,
square root 4, square root 3,

00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:26.870
square root 2.

00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:29.020
But then there is
sort of a time where

00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:32.050
all these different frequencies
have done an integer

00:26:32.050 --> 00:26:34.430
number of oscillations
each, and then you

00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:35.800
get what is called a revival.

00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:43.430
And if you go to a
large photon number,

00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:47.120
you have square root 100,
square root 99, square root 88,

00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:49.930
the revival will happen
at a later and later time

00:26:49.930 --> 00:26:54.400
and eventually at infinite times
if you use a microscopic field.

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:59.030
But for small coherent
states, or thermal states,

00:26:59.030 --> 00:27:01.300
which only involve
a few photons,

00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:02.970
you will get a
revival phenomenon.

00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:12.890
And this has indeed
been observed.

00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:23.660
This was actually the PhD
thesis of Gerhard Rempe,

00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:28.930
and it shows the probability
in the excited state.

00:27:28.930 --> 00:27:32.420
They had previously observed
the Rabi oscillations

00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:35.880
at early times, but
now the experiment

00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:39.620
had to be adjusted, I think
by using slower atoms,

00:27:39.620 --> 00:27:41.660
to observe the longer time.

00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:46.800
And here, well, 1987 for
the first time revivals

00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:47.735
have been seen.

00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:57.110
Let me dwell on that,
or first are there

00:27:57.110 --> 00:28:01.610
any questions about
what happens now?

00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:05.770
Atoms in the cavity
to Rabi oscillations?

00:28:05.770 --> 00:28:09.756
And if the photon field
is a superposition

00:28:09.756 --> 00:28:15.510
of only a few states due to
this pseudo commensurability,

00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:17.400
you find times where
you have revivals.

00:28:22.530 --> 00:28:26.620
I just worked out
something this morning

00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:30.310
which I think is nice,
because it will highlight

00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:33.330
how you should think about
spontaneous emission.

00:28:33.330 --> 00:28:34.615
So let me discuss.

00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:39.520
It doesn't really
matter, but I want

00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:45.260
to give you a specific example
that we have a coherent state.

00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:47.770
A lot of you know what a
coherent photon state is.

00:28:47.770 --> 00:28:49.580
For those who don't,
it doesn't really

00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:51.810
matter for what I want
to explain, and recover

00:28:51.810 --> 00:28:53.680
that in [? 8.4.22. ?]

00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:58.970
But if you have a laser or if
you have a microwave generator,

00:28:58.970 --> 00:29:04.270
what comes out is a field which
has a normalized amplitude

00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:09.980
of alpha, but your field
is in a superposition

00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:11.135
state or [? flux ?] states.

00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:20.480
With these prefactors, I just
wanted to give you an example.

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:22.740
What I really just
mean is that we

00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:26.370
have a coherent superposition
of number states.

00:29:26.370 --> 00:29:28.710
We have prepared that.

00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:32.630
So now we have one atom
in the excited state,

00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:36.520
it enters the cavity
which has been prepared

00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:39.820
with the short pulse
for a laser or microwave

00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:42.710
synthesizer in
these state alpha.

00:29:46.610 --> 00:29:53.970
And now we want to discuss--
so this is at t equals 0--

00:29:53.970 --> 00:29:58.950
and now I want to discuss what
happens as a function of time.

00:29:58.950 --> 00:30:06.450
Well, we know that if
you have one tablet,

00:30:06.450 --> 00:30:16.000
n, we have Rabi oscillations
between the atoms

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.630
in the excited state,
and we have n photons.

00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:22.640
Or it has emitted the
photon, and then we

00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:24.945
have n plus 1 photon
and the cavity.

00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:45.600
But now, we have a
superposition state,

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:47.835
and we have amplitudes an.

00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:01.100
So I mean, that's what we get.

00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:03.340
And this includes everything.

00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:06.420
It includes everything
a two-level atom

00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:08.860
does in a single
mode of a cavity.

00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:12.150
And this is spontaneous
emission, stimulated emission,

00:31:12.150 --> 00:31:13.980
and reabsorption.

00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:18.650
But I want to use
that now to discuss

00:31:18.650 --> 00:31:24.425
with you the misconceptions
about spontaneous emission.

00:31:27.545 --> 00:31:28.045
Colin?

00:31:28.045 --> 00:31:29.824
AUDIENCE: We're talking about
just spontaneous emissions

00:31:29.824 --> 00:31:30.800
into the cavity?

00:31:34.587 --> 00:31:35.170
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:31:35.170 --> 00:31:37.850
I've singled out a single mode.

00:31:37.850 --> 00:31:42.980
But what happens is-- and you're
just two minutes, 30 seconds,

00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:47.800
ahead of me-- that we
had discussed vacuum Rabi

00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:49.760
oscillations or Rabi
oscillations when

00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:51.720
we have n photons in the cavity.

00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:55.020
This was our two-level system,
our Hamiltonian, and all

00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:59.340
we get is Rabi oscillations
with the Rabi frequency omega n.

00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:02.180
And now we have to
sort of do averaging.

00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:06.070
I'm now discussing that we
have a coherent superposition

00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:07.610
of number states.

00:32:07.610 --> 00:32:10.920
Let's say, a pulse of coherent
radiation, a coherent state,

00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:13.260
and this is what we get.

00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:18.370
You can now, if you want, put in
a [? zillion ?] of other modes,

00:32:18.370 --> 00:32:21.370
have another sum over all
the other modes you want.

00:32:21.370 --> 00:32:24.020
So I'm just doing the
first step in discussing

00:32:24.020 --> 00:32:28.090
with you what will happen,
but adding more and more

00:32:28.090 --> 00:32:31.270
modes will actually not change
the structure of the answer

00:32:31.270 --> 00:32:34.650
and will be, of course,
quantitatively a mess

00:32:34.650 --> 00:32:38.180
but conceptually not
more complicated.

00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:40.100
So I want you to
really look at that

00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:43.100
and realize where
is the spontaneity

00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:46.120
of spontaneous emission.

00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:49.681
Where do you see any form
of randomness associated

00:32:49.681 --> 00:32:51.555
with spontaneous emission
in this expression?

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.530
I don't see it.

00:33:03.530 --> 00:33:08.140
This is a wave function, and
this time evolution is unitary.

00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:19.680
Everything is deterministic,
and depending now

00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:23.060
how we choose our coefficient,
there is even a revival.

00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:25.340
It's not dissipative that
a photon is spontaneously

00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:26.660
emitted, and it's done.

00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:28.495
We saw in the single
photon Rabi oscillation

00:33:28.495 --> 00:33:32.450
it can be reabsorbed, we saw
in a slightly more complicated

00:33:32.450 --> 00:33:36.550
situation that there are
at least partial revivals,

00:33:36.550 --> 00:33:39.680
and it now depends
how long we wait

00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:41.920
whether revivals will
take place or whether they

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:44.550
will be complete revivals
or partial revivals.

00:33:44.550 --> 00:33:48.520
But we don't need a revival
in a coherent evolution,

00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:51.190
the coherent evolution can
just go to a complicated wave

00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:55.620
function and it's still a
single coherent wave function

00:33:55.620 --> 00:34:02.100
fully deterministically obtained
form the Hamilton operator.

00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:06.180
Sometimes it pops into our
eyes through a reversible

00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:09.321
oscillation or through revival,
but we don't need that.

00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:23.570
So let me write it down but
then explain you something.

00:34:23.570 --> 00:34:26.719
So it's unitary.

00:34:26.719 --> 00:34:31.820
There is no spontaneity at all.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:50.500
However, eventually we want to
retrieve the classical limit.

00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:53.980
So if we would go
to this situation

00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:58.560
that the average photon
number is much smaller than 1,

00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:06.550
then the fluctuation
in the photon field

00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:08.905
around the mean
number are very small.

00:35:08.905 --> 00:35:13.520
For the coherent state the
fluctuations are square root n.

00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:23.880
And then, we retrieve the
limit of semiclassical Rabi

00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:30.700
flopping with the
Rabi frequency omega

00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:41.310
r, which is-- I'm not consistent
here with lower and uppercase

00:35:41.310 --> 00:35:41.860
[INAUDIBLE].

00:35:41.860 --> 00:35:45.070
So it's uppercase or
lowercase omega n,

00:35:45.070 --> 00:35:48.980
and this is square root n
times the single photon Rabi

00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:49.970
frequency.

00:35:49.970 --> 00:35:54.270
And, of course, for a
large number of photons,

00:35:54.270 --> 00:35:59.654
we can always make
the approximation

00:35:59.654 --> 00:36:01.070
that we do not
have to distinguish

00:36:01.070 --> 00:36:02.285
between n and n plus 1.

00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:09.200
So this is the
ultimate limit if we

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:12.580
would work in the limit
of large photon numbers.

00:36:12.580 --> 00:36:16.280
So the way how you should
look at it is the following.

00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:19.810
This system undergoes
a time evolution

00:36:19.810 --> 00:36:22.360
to a state which is
rather complicated.

00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:25.990
But if you make
the number n large,

00:36:25.990 --> 00:36:31.450
this becomes
approximately a state

00:36:31.450 --> 00:36:33.340
where you have
simply-- you know what

00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:34.840
the rate of the
semiclassical limit?

00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:37.680
In the semiclassical limit,
we have a constant laser beam

00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:40.090
with constant electric
field amplitude, e,

00:36:40.090 --> 00:36:42.130
and then we have driven
Rabi oscillations

00:36:42.130 --> 00:36:45.800
between ground
and excited state.

00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:48.900
So therefore, I don't want
to show you mathematically,

00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:52.770
but in the limit of large
n, you can approximate

00:36:52.770 --> 00:36:55.570
this complicated
entangled wave function

00:36:55.570 --> 00:36:58.470
by the product of
Rabi oscillations

00:36:58.470 --> 00:37:03.180
between ground and excited state
times a coherent photon field.

00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:11.240
And the correction
between what I just said

00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:17.470
and this complicated wave
function is like 1 over n,

00:37:17.470 --> 00:37:20.900
because it's sort of a
1 over n approximation

00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:22.810
where we have
neglected terms which

00:37:22.810 --> 00:37:27.040
the relative importance
of them is 1 over n.

00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:31.000
So therefore, there
are people who will say

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.380
and who will tell
you when we have

00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:36.470
an interaction of an atom
with a coherent state,

00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:41.010
and let's just think in the
number of n being large,

00:37:41.010 --> 00:37:46.260
that n times out of n plus
1, we have a coherent state.

00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:48.110
The atom does Rabi
oscillation and what

00:37:48.110 --> 00:37:51.410
it does is it just emits
photon into the coherent field

00:37:51.410 --> 00:37:54.760
and takes it back, like
in semiclassical physics.

00:37:54.760 --> 00:38:00.030
But in one case out of
n cases, or the rate

00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:03.302
1 over n of the rate of the
wave function is sort of fuzzy.

00:38:03.302 --> 00:38:05.010
It's not a coherent
state; it's something

00:38:05.010 --> 00:38:06.840
much more complicated.

00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:11.160
And if you do not keep track
of this complicated nature

00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:15.192
of the wave function and just
do some simple measurement by,

00:38:15.192 --> 00:38:16.650
let's say, just
measuring the phase

00:38:16.650 --> 00:38:19.195
of the electromagnetic
wave by projecting

00:38:19.195 --> 00:38:21.970
onto a coherent
state, then you would

00:38:21.970 --> 00:38:26.750
find that with the
probability of n

00:38:26.750 --> 00:38:29.590
the system was just staying
in a coherent state.

00:38:29.590 --> 00:38:32.770
And with a probability
which is one part out of n,

00:38:32.770 --> 00:38:37.315
something else has happened,
and your detector cannot capture

00:38:37.315 --> 00:38:39.680
the entanglement of that state.

00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:42.550
And this last part
is what some people

00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:44.370
associate with
spontaneous emission.

00:38:47.050 --> 00:38:48.080
I don't know.

00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:51.920
That's my view where the
spontaneity in this process is.

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:54.650
It's not a spontaneity
in the time evolution.

00:38:54.650 --> 00:38:57.290
It's more a spontaneity
if you do not

00:38:57.290 --> 00:39:00.820
care to detect this
complexity, but map it back

00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:02.500
to a coherent state.

00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:05.880
And then with a precision
which is 1 over n,

00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:08.530
you retrieve the
semiclassical limit,

00:39:08.530 --> 00:39:11.050
but the difference between
the semiclassical limit

00:39:11.050 --> 00:39:14.600
and the entangled wave function,
this is what some people say

00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:17.980
is spontaneous because it's not
captured by a single picture.

00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:27.210
I'm actually expecting some
people to disagree with me,

00:39:27.210 --> 00:39:29.800
but this is sort
of my view, what

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:32.989
I'm sort of learning from
the simple examples I've

00:39:32.989 --> 00:39:33.530
given to you.

00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:53.050
Since Ike is an expert
on it, maybe, Ike,

00:39:53.050 --> 00:39:56.480
can I ask you the question is
there actually a simple way

00:39:56.480 --> 00:40:00.470
to show that if I go
to a large n limit

00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:06.460
that you can sort of really show
that n parts out of n plus 1

00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:10.250
is really described fully
by the semiclassical limit

00:40:10.250 --> 00:40:13.110
and there is only
a 1 over n fraction

00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:16.270
where we have to look at the
more complicated wave function?

00:40:16.270 --> 00:40:18.520
AUDIENCE: I don't think
there's a simple way to do it,

00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:20.970
but one can look
at the equivalence

00:40:20.970 --> 00:40:24.615
of a [? and a factor ?]
state, and they're only

00:40:24.615 --> 00:40:26.675
different by one photon number.

00:40:26.675 --> 00:40:27.925
PROFESSOR: It's sort of clear.

00:40:27.925 --> 00:40:32.800
I mean, everything is if you
approximate n by n plus 1.

00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:34.790
If you don't care about
the small difference,

00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:37.010
everything falls into
place and is simple.

00:40:37.010 --> 00:40:38.605
But I was just
wondering if one could

00:40:38.605 --> 00:40:43.530
show sort of in a more direct
or more intuitive or maybe

00:40:43.530 --> 00:40:47.810
more quantitatively
what is really

00:40:47.810 --> 00:40:51.920
the extra part beyond
stimulated emission

00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:54.220
absorption into
the coherent state.

00:40:54.220 --> 00:40:55.690
So what sort of
really the nature

00:40:55.690 --> 00:41:00.214
of what people call the
spontaneously emitted photon?

00:41:00.214 --> 00:41:04.885
AUDIENCE: I think that I don't
the question, because I still

00:41:04.885 --> 00:41:07.507
argue that it's purely
[? unitary ?] evolution even--

00:41:07.507 --> 00:41:08.090
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:41:08.090 --> 00:41:10.038
AUDIENCE: For that system,
and therefore, it's

00:41:10.038 --> 00:41:11.986
purely [INAUDIBLE] and
nothing spontaneous

00:41:11.986 --> 00:41:14.910
is happening at all.

00:41:14.910 --> 00:41:16.931
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:41:16.931 --> 00:41:17.430
All right.

00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:17.930
Good.

00:41:17.930 --> 00:41:20.050
OK.

00:41:20.050 --> 00:41:21.020
Fine.

00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:21.910
What is next?

00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:30.210
I think this finishes our
discussion on vacuum Rabi

00:41:30.210 --> 00:41:31.850
oscillations and revivals.

00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:38.240
I have now two
topics in light atom

00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:43.240
interaction which you may
not find in many textbooks,

00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:47.410
but it's my experience that
they're really relevant.

00:41:47.410 --> 00:41:49.400
One is very conceptual.

00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:52.000
It's about the rotating
wave approximation.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:56.140
And the other one is just
the opposite, very technical.

00:41:56.140 --> 00:41:58.390
It's not really a
new concept, but this

00:41:58.390 --> 00:42:03.490
is about saturation
intensities and cross-section

00:42:03.490 --> 00:42:05.600
of an atom for absorption.

00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:08.730
The last things, cross-section
for absorption and saturation

00:42:08.730 --> 00:42:11.320
intensity, that's
what you need when

00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:13.440
you talk to atoms
in the laboratory.

00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:17.360
These are the quantities in
which we think intuitively

00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:19.290
about light atom interaction.

00:42:19.290 --> 00:42:21.890
So it's not involving
any concept.

00:42:21.890 --> 00:42:26.940
I want to spend 20 minutes in
introducing for you saturation,

00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:29.800
saturation parameter,
cross-section,

00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:32.480
what's different between
monochromatic light

00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:33.910
and broadband light.

00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:36.380
But before I do that,
I have a few minutes

00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:37.900
on the rotating
wave approximation.

00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:57.010
So let's call it rotating
wave approximation revisited.

00:42:57.010 --> 00:42:58.670
Again, rotating
wave approximation.

00:43:02.550 --> 00:43:05.490
And what I want to discuss
can be discussed in

00:43:05.490 --> 00:43:08.550
the fully quantized
picture, but also

00:43:08.550 --> 00:43:10.070
in the semiclassical picture.

00:43:17.130 --> 00:43:22.950
In the fully quantized
picture, just a reminder,

00:43:22.950 --> 00:43:31.020
what we discussed
earlier was that when

00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:36.770
we have the atomic
raising and lowering

00:43:36.770 --> 00:43:41.380
operator and the photonic
raising and blowing operator,

00:43:41.380 --> 00:43:44.870
we got four terms.

00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:46.930
And two of the terms
are co-rotating,

00:43:46.930 --> 00:43:48.045
two are counter-rotating.

00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:54.340
But I can get exactly
the same number

00:43:54.340 --> 00:43:58.080
of four terms in this
semiclassical picture,

00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:00.670
and I want you to see both.

00:44:00.670 --> 00:44:05.540
But in the quantized picture,
it's actually easier,

00:44:05.540 --> 00:44:07.650
because when you see a
and [? a dega, ?] you

00:44:07.650 --> 00:44:10.520
know immediately one is
absorption one is emission.

00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:12.792
So therefore let
me explain to you

00:44:12.792 --> 00:44:14.750
what I want to tell you
about the rotating wave

00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:17.960
approximation using the
semiclassical picture,

00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:19.450
because then you
immediately know

00:44:19.450 --> 00:44:21.158
how to apply it to
the quantized picture.

00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:32.160
So what I want to bring in the
here in addition to what we

00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:34.630
have discussed about
light atom interaction,

00:44:34.630 --> 00:44:38.130
we had sort of a
dipole Hamiltonian,

00:44:38.130 --> 00:44:42.850
is the fact that we have
circular polarized light,

00:44:42.850 --> 00:44:46.440
left-handed and
right-handed light,

00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:49.470
and I want to sort of
use that and combine it

00:44:49.470 --> 00:44:53.510
with angular momentum selection
roles, which as you remember

00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:56.690
we discussed after our
discussion of dipole,

00:44:56.690 --> 00:45:00.040
quadrupole, and magnetic
dipole positions.

00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:02.130
So I put now all
those parts together

00:45:02.130 --> 00:45:04.835
and revisit the rotating
wave approximation.

00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:14.100
So what I hope for is it
tells you a little bit

00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:18.400
how selection roles,
angular momentum,

00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:22.670
circular polarization,
and semiclassical field

00:45:22.670 --> 00:45:25.275
which rotate in one direction
how they are all connected.

00:45:29.260 --> 00:45:33.760
So I have to set
up the situation

00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:47.690
by saying that we use as a
quantization axis the direction

00:45:47.690 --> 00:45:52.590
k, which is either the
direction of the propagation

00:45:52.590 --> 00:45:55.352
of the light beam
or, in general,

00:45:55.352 --> 00:45:56.810
it's orthogonal to
the polarization

00:45:56.810 --> 00:46:01.170
of the electric
and magnetic field.

00:46:01.170 --> 00:46:06.660
And I can talk about an
electric field driving

00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:08.480
an electric dipole transition.

00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:10.950
I can talk about
a magnetic field

00:46:10.950 --> 00:46:12.710
driving a magnetic transition.

00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:16.160
It doesn't really matter.

00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:18.680
I will use [? Bsc ?]
amplitude, but you can also

00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:21.360
immediately think
electric dipole,

00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:23.910
and this field is
linearly polarized.

00:46:28.970 --> 00:46:32.840
But I want to immediately
decompose this field

00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:37.660
into right-handed and
left-handed field.

00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:39.910
Or a linearly
polarized field can

00:46:39.910 --> 00:46:43.300
be regarded as a superposition
of a field which circulates

00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:46.830
this way plus one which
circulates the other way.

00:46:46.830 --> 00:46:49.770
And ultimately, the
message we will see

00:46:49.770 --> 00:46:53.440
is that if you have
linearly polarized light,

00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:55.820
we always get counter-rotating
term, we always

00:46:55.820 --> 00:46:57.690
have a [INAUDIBLE]
shift and such.

00:46:57.690 --> 00:47:02.020
But if you use rotating fields
or circularly polarized light,

00:47:02.020 --> 00:47:05.450
selection roles may
actually lead to the result

00:47:05.450 --> 00:47:08.080
that there is no
counter-rotating term at all.

00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:10.780
So this is eventually
what I'm aiming for,

00:47:10.780 --> 00:47:14.235
and this will be the final
point of the discussion.

00:47:17.770 --> 00:47:27.610
So the field which rotates
in the right-handed direction

00:47:27.610 --> 00:47:31.110
where the rotating field is
a superposition of x and y,

00:47:31.110 --> 00:47:32.780
or i and j.

00:47:32.780 --> 00:47:35.950
And one the rotates
has a cosine omega t

00:47:35.950 --> 00:47:39.340
and one has sine omega t.

00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:42.334
I don't need to write
down the left-handed part,

00:47:42.334 --> 00:47:43.750
because there's
just a minus sign.

00:47:46.580 --> 00:47:50.440
Or this will actually
become very handy.

00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:53.460
I do all the discussion
for the right-handed part,

00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:56.800
but I can always
obtain the expression

00:47:56.800 --> 00:48:02.120
for the left-handed part by
replacing omega by minus omega.

00:48:06.370 --> 00:48:09.500
Which will mean that
some emission process

00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:12.420
by the right-handed part
will be an absorption

00:48:12.420 --> 00:48:14.400
process by the left-hand part.

00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:15.900
Be we'll see.

00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:18.410
You can change angular
momentum by plus 1

00:48:18.410 --> 00:48:21.104
by absorbing a right-handed
photon or-- you'll see.

00:48:21.104 --> 00:48:21.770
We'll get there.

00:48:21.770 --> 00:48:23.660
So anyway, those signs
will become important.

00:48:26.510 --> 00:48:29.110
Let me now take the
above expression

00:48:29.110 --> 00:48:37.950
for the right-handed part
and replace cosine omega t

00:48:37.950 --> 00:48:41.670
and sine omega t by
e to the i omega t.

00:48:51.950 --> 00:48:57.600
So this was the i component,
this was the j component.

00:48:57.600 --> 00:48:58.850
We divide by 2.

00:49:03.890 --> 00:49:06.790
Just to avoid confusion,
I want to emphasize

00:49:06.790 --> 00:49:09.210
I've started with a real field.

00:49:09.210 --> 00:49:13.570
So I'm not using, as you often
do in e and m complex field

00:49:13.570 --> 00:49:16.240
and the real fields
are the real part,

00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:18.570
I have not started
out by adding,

00:49:18.570 --> 00:49:20.700
you know, imaginary
parts to the field.

00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:23.470
I've started out with a
linearly polarized field

00:49:23.470 --> 00:49:25.800
in the x direction
cosine omega t,

00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:28.600
and I've decomposed it
into two real fields.

00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:31.300
One is right-handed,
one is left-handed.

00:49:31.300 --> 00:49:33.710
Complex numbers
only come because I

00:49:33.710 --> 00:49:37.270
want to use a complex
exponential to replace

00:49:37.270 --> 00:49:38.670
cosine omega t and sine omega t.

00:49:41.930 --> 00:49:45.460
We are almost done with the
decomposition of the field.

00:49:45.460 --> 00:49:49.670
I just wanted to-- we
have now four terms,

00:49:49.670 --> 00:49:53.320
and I want to [? recoup ?] them.

00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:57.670
i minus imaginary unit j.

00:49:57.670 --> 00:50:03.030
i plus imaginary unit j.

00:50:03.030 --> 00:50:07.040
This is e to the i omega t.

00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:10.980
And this is e to
the minus i omega t.

00:50:14.340 --> 00:50:17.200
So what have we done?

00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:20.370
Well, we've just started with
linearly repolarized light,

00:50:20.370 --> 00:50:23.430
and I've rewritten
the expression twice,

00:50:23.430 --> 00:50:27.160
and now we are looking only at
one of the circular components,

00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:30.980
and in the end what
we have is four terms.

00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:35.320
Well, that's also what we
had in the fully quantized

00:50:35.320 --> 00:50:39.330
Hamiltonian, and we now want to
identify what those four terms.

00:50:39.330 --> 00:50:43.360
Two will be co-rotating, two
will be counter-rotating,

00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:46.110
but it's very helpful
to analyze those terms.

00:50:50.340 --> 00:50:57.650
But there are two things
we have to look at now.

00:50:57.650 --> 00:51:00.480
One is we have an
e to the i omega t.

00:51:03.740 --> 00:51:06.240
And, well, it's probably
a sign convention,

00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:09.170
but trust me, if you put that
in the Schrodinger equation,

00:51:09.170 --> 00:51:13.330
it mean that you increase
the energy of the atom

00:51:13.330 --> 00:51:15.430
if you drive it with
e to the i omega t.

00:51:15.430 --> 00:51:18.130
You take it from a ground state
to an excited state, which

00:51:18.130 --> 00:51:21.370
differs in frequency by
omega, and therefore this

00:51:21.370 --> 00:51:24.130
means you have increased
the energy of the system,

00:51:24.130 --> 00:51:26.660
and this corresponds
to absorption.

00:51:26.660 --> 00:51:31.550
Whereas this one here
means we take an atom

00:51:31.550 --> 00:51:34.010
from an excited state
to a ground state,

00:51:34.010 --> 00:51:36.480
and this is the situation
of stimulated emission.

00:51:39.880 --> 00:51:43.110
Remember, in selection
roles we take our field

00:51:43.110 --> 00:51:46.160
and we multiply it
with a dipole moment,

00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:48.550
electric, magnetic
dipole moment whatever.

00:51:48.550 --> 00:51:53.580
But now we want to use also the
spherical tensor decomposition

00:51:53.580 --> 00:51:54.940
of those dipole moments.

00:51:54.940 --> 00:51:57.980
It's a complicated
word, but what

00:51:57.980 --> 00:52:03.710
it means is those terms are
dotted with the dipole moment,

00:52:03.710 --> 00:52:08.940
and if you do it now
component-by-component,

00:52:08.940 --> 00:52:15.780
we retrieve selection roles
because this peaks out the--

00:52:15.780 --> 00:52:18.890
let me just write it
down-- the x plus y

00:52:18.890 --> 00:52:25.860
tensor component of
the matrix element.

00:52:25.860 --> 00:52:31.990
And this corresponds to
delta m equals plus 1.

00:52:31.990 --> 00:52:34.430
We change the angular
momentum by one unit,

00:52:34.430 --> 00:52:38.115
and of course this term is
then delta m equals minus 1.

00:52:45.080 --> 00:52:47.030
So we have done the work.

00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:50.480
What I want to do now is
just map those terms into

00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:52.110
and energy level diagram.

00:52:52.110 --> 00:52:55.040
I like sort of pictorial
representations,

00:52:55.040 --> 00:53:00.430
and each term becomes now
a graphical [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:00.430 --> 00:53:07.180
So let us assume we have a
system, hydrogen is to p state.

00:53:07.180 --> 00:53:11.520
But let's say generally we
go from a j equals 0 to j

00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:17.555
equals 1 state, which
has three components.

00:53:20.170 --> 00:53:29.750
Now, I have set it up in
such a way that-- oops,

00:53:29.750 --> 00:53:31.165
we need a little
bit extra space.

00:53:35.190 --> 00:53:39.370
I've set it up in such a way
that the states here, this

00:53:39.370 --> 00:53:45.510
is m equals 0, this
is m equals plus 1,

00:53:45.510 --> 00:53:49.490
and this is m equals minus 1.

00:53:49.490 --> 00:53:53.560
So therefore-- let
me just use color

00:53:53.560 --> 00:54:10.360
coding now-- this one here
is delta m equals plus 1

00:54:10.360 --> 00:54:17.040
so this one always
moves to the right.

00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:21.100
It changes angular momentum
by 1 so it can always

00:54:21.100 --> 00:54:27.130
move to the right, whereas
the other one, delta m

00:54:27.130 --> 00:54:30.280
equals minus 1,
moves to the bank.

00:54:30.280 --> 00:54:34.760
Absorption is e to the i
omega t, always moves up.

00:54:34.760 --> 00:54:36.860
And stimulated
emission moves down.

00:54:58.120 --> 00:55:07.230
So with that what
happens is this term here

00:55:07.230 --> 00:55:11.120
transfers one unit of
angular momentum and energy.

00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:15.270
So that would mean
this term goes up here.

00:55:15.270 --> 00:55:19.950
It could go up here, if
[? there were a ?] state.

00:55:19.950 --> 00:55:30.130
The other term-- let me use
a green color-- is driving

00:55:30.130 --> 00:55:32.065
the process in the
opposite direction.

00:55:35.410 --> 00:55:40.890
But now we have to also consider
that you can go down here,

00:55:40.890 --> 00:55:44.750
and you can go down
to a virtual state.

00:55:47.470 --> 00:55:49.510
A virtual state
is just something

00:55:49.510 --> 00:55:52.300
which has the same wave
function as a state,

00:55:52.300 --> 00:55:55.170
it just has an e to
the i omega t, which

00:55:55.170 --> 00:55:57.079
is not-- it's a driven system.

00:55:57.079 --> 00:55:57.620
You drive it.

00:55:57.620 --> 00:55:58.890
You [INAUDIBLE] a state.

00:55:58.890 --> 00:56:01.130
You [INAUDIBLE] a state
at the drive frequency,

00:56:01.130 --> 00:56:04.160
and it just means, in
this case, this state

00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:09.350
has an oscillation e to the i
omega t, which is very, very

00:56:09.350 --> 00:56:12.560
different from what a state
which is populated would have,

00:56:12.560 --> 00:56:15.720
and this is what we
call a virtual state.

00:56:15.720 --> 00:56:19.670
So in other words,
what is possible is

00:56:19.670 --> 00:56:24.490
we have our three states,
plus minus 1 and 0,

00:56:24.490 --> 00:56:27.300
but this is the
spatial wave function

00:56:27.300 --> 00:56:30.030
including angular momentum.

00:56:30.030 --> 00:56:33.840
But we can now drive it by
plus omega and minus omega,

00:56:33.840 --> 00:56:37.240
and therefore we can
have it as virtual states

00:56:37.240 --> 00:56:40.190
pretty much at any
energy we want.

00:56:40.190 --> 00:56:43.550
But this process
here is not possible,

00:56:43.550 --> 00:56:48.490
because this would require
to go to a state which has m

00:56:48.490 --> 00:56:51.660
equals 2, which does not exist.

00:56:51.660 --> 00:56:54.030
So now what I've
shown here is if we

00:56:54.030 --> 00:56:56.770
would stock in the
m equals 0 state,

00:56:56.770 --> 00:57:00.670
I've shown you the four
terms, two are co-rotating

00:57:00.670 --> 00:57:02.480
and two are counter-rotating.

00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:05.020
If you neglect this
virtual state which

00:57:05.020 --> 00:57:09.530
has a detuning of about
2 omega, or 2 resonance

00:57:09.530 --> 00:57:12.070
frequency of the atom,
this is the rotating wave

00:57:12.070 --> 00:57:13.730
approximation.

00:57:13.730 --> 00:57:16.850
One term is responsible
for absorption;

00:57:16.850 --> 00:57:21.360
the other term is responsible
for a stimulated emission.

00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:24.640
But if I don't make the
rotating wave approximation,

00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:25.875
I have those two extra terms.

00:57:36.130 --> 00:57:39.830
So this is only the
right-handed light,

00:57:39.830 --> 00:57:42.400
and I want to sort of play a
little bit with this concept.

00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:45.110
If I would take the
left-handed light,

00:57:45.110 --> 00:57:47.690
I would add sort of
four more arrows.

00:57:47.690 --> 00:57:51.330
Two more here and two more here.

00:57:51.330 --> 00:57:52.870
But let's just
keep the situation

00:57:52.870 --> 00:57:54.260
as simple as possible.

00:57:54.260 --> 00:57:56.177
But I really sort
of like that you

00:57:56.177 --> 00:57:58.770
write down right-handed,
left-handed side,

00:57:58.770 --> 00:58:00.970
decompose it into
its components,

00:58:00.970 --> 00:58:04.410
and each component is now
in this diagram connected

00:58:04.410 --> 00:58:07.900
to an arrow where one
direction is angular momentum,

00:58:07.900 --> 00:58:09.020
the other one is energy.

00:58:12.250 --> 00:58:26.050
So let me now talk about
other energy diagrams.

00:58:26.050 --> 00:58:28.550
And this will lead
to the answer.

00:58:28.550 --> 00:58:35.430
Well, can we create
a situation where

00:58:35.430 --> 00:58:39.310
we have only two terms,
which would be the simplest

00:58:39.310 --> 00:58:41.430
two-level system, can
be directly realized

00:58:41.430 --> 00:58:46.090
without any rotating
wave approximation

00:58:46.090 --> 00:58:48.770
a two-level system?

00:58:48.770 --> 00:58:52.035
So if we had two levels,
which have only m

00:58:52.035 --> 00:58:56.640
equals 0 and m equals 1.

00:58:56.640 --> 00:58:58.670
So this would be
the situation I just

00:58:58.670 --> 00:59:00.140
discussed with those two levels.

00:59:09.240 --> 00:59:14.200
So the only way how I can fit
in this arrow is this one,

00:59:14.200 --> 00:59:18.130
and the diagonally
downward arrow is that.

00:59:18.130 --> 00:59:22.095
So in this case, rotating
wave approximation

00:59:22.095 --> 00:59:24.600
is not an approximation,
it is exact.

00:59:27.250 --> 00:59:30.430
But some purists will
actually say, hey,

00:59:30.430 --> 00:59:33.240
you can never realize
that when you have an n

00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:36.350
equals plus 1 state.

00:59:36.350 --> 00:59:39.490
Then you always have an
m equals minus 1 state.

00:59:39.490 --> 00:59:41.950
And then you have a
virtual state down there,

00:59:41.950 --> 00:59:44.350
and then you get two
more terms, which

00:59:44.350 --> 00:59:48.610
are the counter-rotating terms
which I just showed above.

00:59:48.610 --> 00:59:51.430
So whole I would say if you
have a neutron star which

00:59:51.430 --> 00:59:53.890
makes an infinitely
high magnetic field,

00:59:53.890 --> 00:59:56.045
you can have a huge
[INAUDIBLE] splitting between m

00:59:56.045 --> 00:59:58.240
equals plus 1 and
m equals minus 1

00:59:58.240 --> 01:00:01.240
and completely move one
of the angular momentum

01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:02.990
states out of the picture.

01:00:02.990 --> 01:00:06.330
But, of course, in the
rotating wave approximation

01:00:06.330 --> 01:00:09.760
we are neglecting off resonant
terms at 2 omega, omega

01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:12.052
being an electronic
excitation energy,

01:00:12.052 --> 01:00:13.760
so I'm really talking
about Zeeman shifts

01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:16.070
here to eliminate
the other state which

01:00:16.070 --> 01:00:18.890
may be comparable to
electronic energies.

01:00:18.890 --> 01:00:22.820
So in principle, I can say
this is my Hilbert space,

01:00:22.820 --> 01:00:25.195
and in this Hilbert space no
rotating wave approximations

01:00:25.195 --> 01:00:26.500
is needed.

01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:30.100
But it's maybe an
artificial Hilbert space.

01:00:30.100 --> 01:00:32.860
When I had a discussion
with other people,

01:00:32.860 --> 01:00:39.470
we came up with the possibility
of some forbidden transition.

01:00:39.470 --> 01:00:43.240
If you go from a doublet
s to a doublet s state

01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:47.560
so all you have is
a spin system which

01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:54.540
has 1/2 angular momentum
plus 1/2 minus 1/2.

01:00:54.540 --> 01:01:00.840
And then you realize
that the only way how

01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:07.060
you can fit in the
orange arrow is

01:01:07.060 --> 01:01:10.620
in this way, and the
green arrow in this way.

01:01:10.620 --> 01:01:12.470
So here you would
have a situation

01:01:12.470 --> 01:01:15.110
where the rotating wave
approximation is exact.

01:01:15.110 --> 01:01:17.720
But, of course, it's not an
electric dipole transition;

01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:24.542
it's some sort of weaker
conversation, which

01:01:24.542 --> 01:01:25.250
may be forbidden.

01:01:32.110 --> 01:01:33.990
I need two more minutes.

01:01:33.990 --> 01:01:38.940
I have discussed the case
where we have quantized

01:01:38.940 --> 01:01:42.630
along a direction, I
called it the k direction,

01:01:42.630 --> 01:01:45.420
and the polarization of
the electromagnetic field

01:01:45.420 --> 01:01:48.610
was [? i and j ?] was
perpendicular to it.

01:01:48.610 --> 01:01:55.530
So let me now discuss a
case where we quantize along

01:01:55.530 --> 01:01:59.010
the polarization of the
electromagnetic field,

01:01:59.010 --> 01:02:01.980
and you remember from our
discussion on selection roles

01:02:01.980 --> 01:02:04.440
that this is pi light.

01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:09.260
So in this case, our
magnetic or electric field

01:02:09.260 --> 01:02:12.690
is polarized along
the i direction,

01:02:12.690 --> 01:02:18.970
and the real cosine omega t gets
decomposed into e to the plus

01:02:18.970 --> 01:02:20.750
e to the minus i omega t.

01:02:20.750 --> 01:02:24.580
And we know already one term
is absorption one is emission.

01:02:24.580 --> 01:02:37.020
And now, if I take my j
equals 0 to j equals 1 system,

01:02:37.020 --> 01:02:42.230
pi light has a selection
role of delta m equals 0.

01:02:42.230 --> 01:02:47.870
So now I have an arrow,
which I want to be orange,

01:02:47.870 --> 01:02:48.950
which goes up.

01:02:48.950 --> 01:02:54.240
And a green arrow--
this is a great program.

01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:57.270
The only thing is you have
to be very careful when

01:02:57.270 --> 01:02:59.130
you change color
and press carefully.

01:02:59.130 --> 01:03:02.060
That's why sometimes the colors
are not doing what I want.

01:03:02.060 --> 01:03:03.500
But here is green.

01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:10.710
But now, of course, with
linearly polarized light

01:03:10.710 --> 01:03:13.870
we can always go down
to a virtual state.

01:03:13.870 --> 01:03:15.480
We have now four terms.

01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:23.330
Two are rotating, two
are counter-rotating.

01:03:23.330 --> 01:03:26.400
So therefore the
quick conclusion

01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:32.440
of the last ten minutes is
that there is the possibility

01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:40.550
that counter-rotating
terms can be

01:03:40.550 --> 01:03:58.130
0 for sigma plus sigma minus
light due to angular momentum

01:03:58.130 --> 01:03:58.945
selection roles.

01:04:01.620 --> 01:04:06.890
But what we have also learned is
if you have the m plus 1 state

01:04:06.890 --> 01:04:11.230
in there's an m minus state, if
you have circularly polarized

01:04:11.230 --> 01:04:15.330
light and we drive a transition
between two m states,

01:04:15.330 --> 01:04:18.320
the counter-rotating
term does not

01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:21.490
come from the same set of
two states, m equals 1.

01:04:21.490 --> 01:04:23.580
It involves m equals minus 1.

01:04:23.580 --> 01:04:28.140
So it's the other state which
is maybe degenerate or only

01:04:28.140 --> 01:04:30.570
slightly [? split ?] by
a magnetic field which

01:04:30.570 --> 01:04:34.200
is responsible for the
counter-rotating terms.

01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:36.870
Anyway we have talked so
much about rotating wave

01:04:36.870 --> 01:04:38.680
approximation and
those terms, I just

01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:41.670
wanted to show you
how it is modified

01:04:41.670 --> 01:04:46.490
if you use degeneracy p
states and angular momentum.

01:04:46.490 --> 01:04:48.560
Any question?

01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:50.110
OK.
