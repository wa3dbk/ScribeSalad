00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.730
PROFESSOR: The last topic
we discussed on Monday it

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.400
was the situation of the
Landau-Zener transition

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.280
that you sweep for resonance.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.000
You've all seen the
Landau-Zener formula,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.080
you all know that in crossing
turns into an avoided crossing.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:51.050
But I tried to at least
provide you additional insight

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.310
by emphasizing that the whole
process is absolute coherent.

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:59.230
That it's full-phase
coherent throughout.

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:07.010
And what happens is there is a
coherent transfer of amplitude

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.170
from the state 1 to the state 2.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.150
This is nothing else than
Schrodinger's equation.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.030
But I want to point out
that for the short times

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.040
you sweep through, there
is no T2 independence here.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:28.670
In other words, when
I discussed what

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.580
is the effective
time during which

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.140
the transfer of
population takes place,

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.790
at the time here is so
short that the detuning

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.180
doesn't matter.

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.260
Actually, the
criterion which leads

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.540
to this effective time during
which the transfer takes place

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.390
is actually exactly
the time window

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.410
where the detuning
is small enough

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.780
that-- to say it
loosely, it doesn't

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.670
make a difference whether your
in resonance or slightly away.

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.270
The atom experiences
the same tri field.

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:13.900
And so based on
this criterion, we

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.730
discussed that we can understand
the Landau-Zener probability

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.240
in the perturbative limit
as a coherent process

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.590
where we transfer population,
we transfer amplitude

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.180
with a Rabi frequency during
this effective time, delta t.

00:02:33.647 --> 00:02:35.480
It's not the only way
how we can look at it,

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.090
but it's one way which
I think is insightful.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:47.270
Any questions about this or
what we discussed on Monday?

00:02:52.800 --> 00:03:03.080
If not, I would like to take
the topic one step further

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.695
and discuss the density
matrix formalism.

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:35.720
So we have so far
discussed purely

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.000
Hamiltonian unitary evolution.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.520
Namely, the
Schrodinger equation.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.940
And of course, unitary
evolution leaves the system

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.600
which is in a pure
state in a pure state.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.620
It's just that the
quantum state evolves.

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.500
However, that means we cannot
describe processes like

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:04.870
decoherence or some losses
away from the two levels we are

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.230
focusing on.

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.280
And so now we want to
use the density operator,

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.705
the density operator
formalism to have

00:04:14.705 --> 00:04:17.399
a description of two-level
system which goes beyond that.

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:31.770
So let me just-- so Schrodinger
equation deals only with pure

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:44.767
states, cannot describe loss
of particles, loss of photons,

00:04:44.767 --> 00:04:45.433
and decoherence.

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.040
Well, there is one exception.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:57.880
If the decoherence process is
merely a state-dependent loss

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.280
of atoms to a third
state, then you

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.450
can still use the wave
function formalism.

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:05.655
So this is the exception.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:17.535
If you have two states,
that's the excited state.

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.610
If you have two states
and all of what happens

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:31.410
is that you have some
loss to some other levels

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:42.480
and their rate
coefficients, then one

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:55.470
can still use a
Hamiltonain description,

00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:06.770
but you have to replace the
eigenvalues by complex numbers.

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:17.230
In other words, you have to add
an imaginary part to the energy

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:17.840
levels.

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.215
And that means
the time evolution

00:06:19.215 --> 00:06:22.520
is exponentially dent.

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:27.770
So that's as much as you
can incorporate decoherence

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:31.080
and losses into a wave
function formalism.

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:57.340
However, many other processes
require the formalism

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:59.410
of the density matrix.

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:05.880
And the simplest process
where wave function formalism

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:09.600
is absolutely inadequate
is the process

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:14.160
of spontaneous emission.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.940
When you have a loss
in the excited state,

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:20.370
you could still describe
the excited state

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:23.100
with a complex
energy eigenvalue.

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:34.840
But the fact that whatever is
lost from the excited state

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:36.770
is added to the ground state.

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:38.600
There is no wave
function formalism

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:39.600
which can describe that.

00:07:46.895 --> 00:07:54.100
So for those processes and
for decoherence in general,

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:57.850
we require the use of
the density operator.

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:04.730
So I know that most
of you have seen

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:08.450
the density operator in
statistical mechanics

00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:10.920
or some advanced course
in quantum mechanics.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:15.060
So therefore, I only spend
about five minutes on it.

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:18.960
So I want to kind of just
remind you or give you

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:20.230
a very short introduction.

00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:22.890
So for those of you who
have never heard about it,

00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:26.010
I probably say enough
that you understand

00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:27.530
the following discussion.

00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:30.670
And for those of you who know
already everything about it,

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:35.020
five minutes of recapitulation
is hopefully not too boring.

00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:38.110
So my way of introducing
the density operator

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:42.949
is first introduce it formally.

00:08:42.949 --> 00:08:48.700
Write down a few
equations for pure state.

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:52.880
But then in a moment,
add something to it.

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:58.270
So if you have a time-dependent
wave function, which

00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:07.590
we expand into eigenfunctions,
then we can, in these spaces,

00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:10.420
define arbitrary
operators by matrices.

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:24.610
We want to describe our
system by finding out

00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:27.390
measurable observables,
expectation

00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:34.330
values of operators, which
of course, depend on time.

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:39.760
And this is, of course, nothing
else than the expectation value

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:42.000
taken with a time-dependent
wave function.

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:53.810
But now we can expand
it into the bases m, n

00:09:53.810 --> 00:10:08.030
and we can then rewrite
it as a matrix, which

00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:09.205
is a density matrix.

00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:17.190
Or, simply as the
trace of the density

00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:19.330
matrix with the operator.

00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:31.180
And what I introduced here
as the density matrix can

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:36.320
be written as psi
of t, psi of t.

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:48.750
And the matrix element
given by this combination

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:53.140
of amplitudes when we
expand the wave function

00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:54.515
psi into its basis.

00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:02.510
So this density matrix his
diagonal and off-diagonal

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:04.250
matrix elements.

00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:08.320
The diagram matrix elements
are called the populations,

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:11.780
the populations in state n
and the off-diagonal matrix

00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:14.140
elements are called coherences.

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:22.720
OK, so this is just rewriting
Schrodinger's equation

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:25.660
expectation value in
a matrix formalism.

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:26.854
Yes, please.

00:11:26.854 --> 00:11:30.340
AUDIENCE: Why are you
starring the coefficients?

00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:32.340
PROFESSOR: Oh, there's
one star too many.

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:33.300
Thank you.

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:34.770
AUDIENCE: That makes sense.

00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:36.540
PROFESSOR: But the
reason why I wrote it

00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:43.850
is that we want to now add
some probability to it.

00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:49.400
We do not know for sure that
the system is in a pure state.

00:11:49.400 --> 00:12:03.230
We have probabilities
P i that the system

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:07.810
is in a quantum state psi i.

00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:10.800
So we add another index to it.

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:21.110
And when we perform
the expectation value--

00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:23.560
there's also one star too many.

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:26.320
When we perform the
expectation value,

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:29.200
we sort of do it for
each quantum state

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:33.690
with a probability P i.

00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:36.220
So we are actually-- and this
is what I wanted to point out.

00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:38.310
This was the purpose of
this short discussion,

00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:41.370
that we are now actually
performing two averages.

00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:45.110
One can be regarded
as the normal quantum

00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:49.450
mechanical average when
you find the average value

00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:51.970
or the expectation
value for quantum state.

00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:55.090
So this is sort of the
statistics or the averaging,

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:57.670
which is inherent
in quantum physics.

00:12:57.670 --> 00:13:00.070
But then in addition,
there may simply

00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:04.180
be another probabilistic
average because you have not

00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:06.210
prepared the system
in a pure state,

00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:09.400
or the system may undergo
some stochastic forces

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:11.840
and wind up in different states.

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:14.930
So there are two kinds of
averages which are performed.

00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:18.790
And the advantage of the
density matrix formalism

00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:23.500
is that both kinds of averages
can be done simultaneously

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:26.300
in a very compact formalism.

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:30.440
So therefore, I put this
probabilistic average in now

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:34.845
into the definition
of the density matrix.

00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:46.270
Or I can write the density
matrix in this way.

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:55.140
And with this extended
definition of the density

00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:59.540
matrix, both kinds
of averages are

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:03.580
done when I determine the
expectation value and operator

00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:06.730
by performing the trace
with the density matrix.

00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:23.100
A lot of properties
of the density matrix,

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:27.010
I think are-- you're
familiar with many of those.

00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:32.730
For instance, that Schrodinger's
equation for the density matrix

00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:38.680
becomes this following equation.

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:43.640
You can derive that by-- if you
take the Schrodinger equation

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:49.270
and you apply the Schrodinger
equation to each state psi i.

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:56.860
And then you do the averaging
with a probability P i.

00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:59.910
You find that the Schrodinger
equation for each state

00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:03.240
psi i turns into this equation
for the density matrix.

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:10.540
Let me just write down
that the purpose now

00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:12.890
is we have two averages here.

00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:16.580
One is the quantum
mechanic average and one

00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:25.510
is sort of an ensemble average
with the probabilities P i.

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:31.440
I want to discuss
in a few moments

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:35.000
the density matrix
for two-level system.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000
So I have to remind
you of two properties,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.240
that the density matrix
is normalized to unity.

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:45.900
So there's probability of
unity to find the system

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:47.790
in one of the states.

00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:53.590
When we look at the
square of the density

00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:56.260
matrix, a trace of
rho square, this

00:15:56.260 --> 00:16:00.370
is simply the probability-- the
sum of the probability squared.

00:16:00.370 --> 00:16:02.990
And this is smaller than 1.

00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:07.550
And the only way that it
is one is for pure state.

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:12.840
So pure state is
characterized by the fact

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:16.470
that there is only-- that
we can find the basis where

00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:19.840
only one of the probabilities,
P i is non-vanishing.

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:24.020
And then, of course, almost
trivially the trace rho is 1

00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:25.836
and the trace rho square is 1.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.370
So, so far I've presented
you the density matrix

00:16:41.370 --> 00:16:45.680
just as an elegant way
of integrating the two

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:48.120
averages into one formalism.

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:50.200
And in essence,
this is what it is.

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:53.710
But you can now also
use the density matrix

00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:57.860
if the whole system undergoes
a time evolution, which

00:16:57.860 --> 00:16:59.170
is no longer unitary.

00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:01.660
No longer described by
a Hamilton operator.

00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:03.240
Because you're
interested in the time

00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:05.630
evolution or a
small system which

00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:07.720
is part of a bigger system.

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:10.400
The bigger system is always
described by unitary time

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:15.359
evolution, but a smaller
system is usually not described

00:17:15.359 --> 00:17:17.099
by unitary time evolution.

00:17:17.099 --> 00:17:20.020
And that's when the density
matrix becomes crucial.

00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:22.640
Of course, you can see this is
just you describe the smaller

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:25.480
system and you do some
probabilistic average what

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:27.410
the other part of
the system does.

00:17:27.410 --> 00:17:31.250
And therefore, it's just another
version of doing two averages.

00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:34.480
But this is sort of why
we want to use the density

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:37.810
matrix in general.

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:52.143
So we want to use the density
matrix for non-unitary time

00:17:52.143 --> 00:17:52.643
evolution.

00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:03.160
And the keyword here
is that this is often

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:07.720
the situation for
open systems where

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:10.480
we are interested
in a small system,

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:12.630
but it is open to
a bigger system.

00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:15.120
Like, we're interested
to describe an atom,

00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:18.080
but the atom can
spontaneously emit photons

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:19.705
into other parts of
[INAUDIBLE] space.

00:18:19.705 --> 00:18:21.580
And we're not interested
in those other parts

00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:22.455
of [INAUDIBLE] space.

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:33.660
So an open system
for this purpose

00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:43.750
is where we limit
our description

00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:49.300
to a small part of
a larger system.

00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:58.560
Again, an atom interacting
with all the modes

00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:00.840
of the electromagnetic
field, but we simply

00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:02.540
want to describe the atom.

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:06.190
And then, we cannot use
a wave function anymore.

00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:10.140
We have to use the
density matrix.

00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:11.490
OK

00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:17.920
After these
preliminaries, I want

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:28.502
to now use the density
matrix formalism

00:19:28.502 --> 00:19:32.795
for arbitrary two-level systems.

00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:59.280
So what is the most
general Hamiltonian

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:03.030
for the most general
two-level system?

00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:06.480
Well, the most
general Hamiltonian

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:08.330
is the most general
Hamiltonian we

00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:11.550
can construct with
2 by 2 matrices.

00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:14.940
And the base is
set to expand the 2

00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:18.160
by 2 matrices are
the Pauli matrices.

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:28.240
So if you expand the Hamiltonian
into the unity matrix, sigma x,

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:37.290
sigma y, and sigma z, we
have four coefficients,

00:20:37.290 --> 00:20:41.210
four amplitudes, which are
complex in general-- omega

00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:44.710
1, omega 2, omega 3.

00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:48.110
And here is something which
I've called omega bar.

00:20:58.930 --> 00:21:05.290
By appropriately shifting
what is the 0 point of energy,

00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:07.300
we can always get rid of this.

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:11.130
So this is just this
definitional character.

00:21:11.130 --> 00:21:16.600
So therefore, the most
general Hamiltonian

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:20.260
for any two-level system
can be written in this very

00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:25.660
compact way that it is the
scalar product of the vector

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:30.950
omega-- omega 1, omega 2,
omega 3-- with the vector

00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:34.800
sigma of the three Pauli
matrices-- sigma x, sigma y,

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:35.430
sigma z.

00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:48.230
OK, so this is a
way to write down

00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:52.045
the most general Hamiltonian
for a two-level system.

00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:59.100
Now, we describe two-level
systems by a density matrix,

00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:04.230
by statistical operator,
which is also a 2 by 2 matrix.

00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:08.820
And the most general
density matrix

00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:16.730
can also be expanded into
the its four components.

00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:19.670
Sort of the basis
set of matrices

00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:25.600
is the unitary matrix and
the three Pauli matrices.

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:31.740
So 1, 2, 3.

00:22:36.290 --> 00:22:39.310
Of course, this time we cannot
throw away the unity matrix

00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:42.402
because otherwise the density
matrix would have no trace

00:22:42.402 --> 00:22:44.110
and there would be no
probability to find

00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:44.651
the particle.

00:22:48.850 --> 00:22:56.130
But we can, again, write
it in a compact form

00:22:56.130 --> 00:23:01.580
that it is 1/2-- yes,
I'm using the fact now

00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:07.290
that the trace of rho is r0.

00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:12.820
And this is, by definition, or
by conservation of probability,

00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:13.930
is 1.

00:23:13.930 --> 00:23:15.910
So therefore, r0 is
not a free parameter.

00:23:15.910 --> 00:23:19.260
It's just the sum of
all the probabilities

00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:24.390
to find the system in any state.

00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:30.080
And the non-trivial part
is then the scalar product

00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:35.470
of this vector r-- rx, ry, rz--
with the vector of the three

00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:36.135
Pauli matrices.

00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:48.650
Well, so we have our
most general Hamiltonian.

00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:51.820
We have our most
general density matrix.

00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:56.460
And now we can insert
this into the equation

00:23:56.460 --> 00:24:00.330
of motion for the
density matrix.

00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:05.840
Which, as I said before,
is just a reformulation

00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:07.820
of Schrodinger's equation.

00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:11.870
And if you insert the
Hamiltonian and the density

00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:14.710
matrix into this
equation, we find actually

00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:19.640
something which is very simple.

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:26.220
It says that this
vector r, which

00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:30.890
we call the Bloch vector-- the
derivative of the Bloch vector

00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:38.020
is given by the cross product
of the vector omega, which

00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:44.185
were the coefficients with which
we parametrized the Hamiltonian

00:24:44.185 --> 00:24:45.150
cross r.

00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:50.746
The derivation is
straightforward.

00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:58.630
And you will be asked to do
that on your homework assignment

00:24:58.630 --> 00:24:59.940
number 1.

00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:01.960
But it has a very
powerful meaning.

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:07.150
It tells us that an
arbitrary two-level system

00:25:07.150 --> 00:25:10.000
with an arbitrary
Hamiltonian can

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:15.230
be regarded as a system
where we have a vector

00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:17.530
R which undergoes precession.

00:25:17.530 --> 00:25:19.630
This is the time
evolution of the system.

00:25:22.690 --> 00:25:31.670
So this is a powerful
generalization

00:25:31.670 --> 00:25:40.840
from the result we
discussed previously

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:44.950
where we found that if
you have an arbitrary

00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:50.470
quantum-mechanical spin,
the time derivative can

00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:53.920
be written in that way.

00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:57.060
So previously, we found
it for a pure state,

00:25:57.060 --> 00:25:58.910
but now we find
it-- that it's even

00:25:58.910 --> 00:26:03.060
valid for a general density
matrix and its time evolution.

00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:25.730
So what I've derived for
you is-- Classroom Files.

00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:38.060
Is a famous theorem,
which is traced back

00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:41.650
to Feynman, Vernon,
and Hellwarth.

00:26:41.650 --> 00:26:45.160
It's sort of a
famous paper which--

00:26:57.230 --> 00:27:00.650
So this famous
theorem-- and I've

00:27:00.650 --> 00:27:02.420
summarized it here
for you-- says

00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:06.550
that the time evolution of the
density matrix for the most

00:27:06.550 --> 00:27:13.230
general two-level system is
isomorphic to pure precession.

00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:16.890
And that means it's
isomorphic to the behavior

00:27:16.890 --> 00:27:20.870
of a classical moment,
classical magnetic moment,

00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:24.259
in a suitable time-dependent
magnetic field.

00:27:24.259 --> 00:27:25.800
So when you have a
Hamiltonian, which

00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:28.430
is characterized by-- the
most general Hamiltonian

00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:34.260
is characterized by the three
coefficients-- w1, w2, w3.

00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:37.140
But if you would create
a classical system

00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:45.300
where w1, w2, and w3 are the
time-dependent components,

00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:49.410
xyz-component of a
magnetic field, then

00:27:49.410 --> 00:27:52.350
the precession of
a magnetic moment

00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:55.670
would be exactly the same
as the time evolution

00:27:55.670 --> 00:27:57.500
of a quantum-mechanical
density matrix.

00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:07.175
Any question?

00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:16.190
So in other words,
we've started out

00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:18.270
with rotating
frames and rotation

00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:20.830
and now we've gone
as far as I will go.

00:28:20.830 --> 00:28:23.740
Namely, I've in a
way told you that

00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:26.930
an arbitrary quantum-mechanical
two-level system, the time

00:28:26.930 --> 00:28:29.050
evolution is just precession.

00:28:29.050 --> 00:28:30.960
It's rotation.

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:33.570
There is nothing more
complicated possible.

00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:42.890
Well, unless we talk
about decoherence.

00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:54.040
If we have such a Hamiltonian,
we know, of course,

00:28:54.040 --> 00:29:02.480
that a pure state will
stay pure forever.

00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:11.890
And you can immediately
verify that if you

00:29:11.890 --> 00:29:14.230
look at the trace of rho square.

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:22.390
If the trace of rho square
is 1, we have a pure state.

00:29:22.390 --> 00:29:25.450
And now we have parametrized
the density matrix

00:29:25.450 --> 00:29:30.550
with the Bloch vector
component-- r1, r2, r3.

00:29:30.550 --> 00:29:37.970
So in those components,
the trace of rho square

00:29:37.970 --> 00:29:39.770
can be written in this way.

00:29:43.090 --> 00:29:46.140
And of course, r0
square was constant.

00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:48.740
This was our normalization of 1.

00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:51.890
So the question is now when
we have an arbitrary time

00:29:51.890 --> 00:29:54.990
evolution, which we
know now according

00:29:54.990 --> 00:30:00.656
to the Feynman, Vernon,
Hellwarth theorem.

00:30:00.656 --> 00:30:03.860
The arbitrary time evolution
of the Bloch vector

00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:07.590
can be written as omega cross r.

00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:11.310
So this equation
tells us immediately

00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:15.470
that the length of the
vector r is constant

00:30:15.470 --> 00:30:19.680
because r dot is
always orthogonal to r.

00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:23.260
And therefore, the lengths of
the vector r is not changing.

00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:27.280
So what we have derived says
that with the most general

00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:33.170
Hamiltonian, the lengths of
the vector r will be constant.

00:30:33.170 --> 00:30:37.800
And therefore, the trace of
rho square will be constant.

00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:50.330
This is constant because r
dot is perpendicular to r.

00:30:50.330 --> 00:30:53.090
So this will tell us that
a pure state will just

00:30:53.090 --> 00:30:55.810
precess with the constant
lengths of its Bloch vector

00:30:55.810 --> 00:30:57.420
forever.

00:30:57.420 --> 00:31:01.840
However, we know that in real
life some coherences are lost

00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:03.760
and now we have to
introduce something else.

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:19.055
So this does not describe
loss of coherence.

00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:28.140
So now we are just
one tiny step away

00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:31.705
from introducing
the Bloch equations.

00:31:31.705 --> 00:31:36.320
We will fully feature the
optical Bloch equations

00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:38.660
in 8.422.

00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:42.990
but since we have discussed
two-level systems to quite some

00:31:42.990 --> 00:31:48.160
extent, I cannot resist
to show you now in three,

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:50.830
four minutes what the
Bloch equations are.

00:31:50.830 --> 00:31:53.810
And then when you take the
second part of the course,

00:31:53.810 --> 00:31:57.000
you will already be
familiar with it.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:00.160
So let me just now
tell you what has

00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:07.930
to be added to do this step
from the previous formalism

00:32:07.930 --> 00:32:10.950
to the Bloch equations.

00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:13.280
And this is the one
step you have to do.

00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:17.605
We have to include relaxation
processes into the description.

00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:34.120
So my less than five-minute
way to now derive the Bloch

00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:36.140
equations for you
goes as follows.

00:32:38.850 --> 00:32:42.180
I first remind you
that everything

00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:43.700
has to come to
thermal equilibrium.

00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:51.740
In other words, if you
have an atomic system,

00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:53.890
if you have a quantum
computer, whatever system you

00:32:53.890 --> 00:32:56.180
have and you prepared
in a pure state,

00:32:56.180 --> 00:32:59.920
you know if you
will wait forever,

00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:04.020
the system will be described
by a density matrix, which

00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:07.780
is the density matrix of
thermal equilibrium, which

00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:11.260
has only diagonal
matrix elements.

00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:17.580
The populations follow
the [INAUDIBLE] factor.

00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:25.450
And everything is normalized
by the partition function.

00:33:25.450 --> 00:33:30.070
So we know that this will
happen after long, long times.

00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:42.530
So no matter with what
density matrix we start out,

00:33:42.530 --> 00:33:44.960
if we start with a
density matrix rho

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:49.510
pure state, for instance,
there will be inevitably

00:33:49.510 --> 00:33:55.905
some relaxation process which
will restore rho to rho t,

00:33:55.905 --> 00:33:57.030
to the thermal equilibrium.

00:34:00.130 --> 00:34:02.515
Now, how this happens
can be formulated

00:34:02.515 --> 00:34:04.500
in a microscopic way.

00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:07.370
And we will go through
a beautiful derivation

00:34:07.370 --> 00:34:09.830
of a master equation
and really provide

00:34:09.830 --> 00:34:12.870
some insight what
causes relaxation.

00:34:12.870 --> 00:34:17.460
But here for the
purpose of this course,

00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:21.800
I want to say, well,
there is relaxation.

00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:27.170
And I want to introduce now,
in a phenomenological way,

00:34:27.170 --> 00:34:29.969
damping and damping times.

00:34:29.969 --> 00:34:50.920
So the phenomenological
way to introduce damping

00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:52.280
goes as follows.

00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:56.070
Our equation of motion
for the density matrix

00:34:56.070 --> 00:35:00.130
was that this is a unitary
evolution described

00:35:00.130 --> 00:35:06.420
by-- the Schrodinger
equation was that the density

00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:09.216
matrix evolves according
to the commutative

00:35:09.216 --> 00:35:10.090
with the Hamiltonian.

00:35:13.110 --> 00:35:17.730
But now-- and I have to pick
big quotation marks around it

00:35:17.730 --> 00:35:20.790
because this is not a
mathematically exact way

00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:21.950
of writing it.

00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:26.750
But now I want to
introduce some term which

00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:35.890
will damp the density matrix to
the thermal equilibrium density

00:35:35.890 --> 00:35:39.360
matrix with some
equilibration time, Te.

00:35:49.490 --> 00:35:51.300
I mean, this is
what you can always

00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:53.450
do if you know the
system is damped.

00:35:53.450 --> 00:35:55.630
You have some
coherent evolution,

00:35:55.630 --> 00:35:58.390
but eventually you
added a damping term

00:35:58.390 --> 00:36:01.720
and you make the damping term--
you formulate in such a way

00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:03.440
that asymptotically
the system will

00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:05.850
be damped to the
thermal equilibrium.

00:36:05.850 --> 00:36:07.410
In other words, the
damping term will

00:36:07.410 --> 00:36:09.160
have no effect on the
dynamics once you've

00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:10.430
reached equilibrium.

00:36:10.430 --> 00:36:11.780
So it does all the right things.

00:36:15.345 --> 00:36:17.220
Of course, we have to
be a little bit careful

00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:21.130
because everything is either
an operator or matrix.

00:36:21.130 --> 00:36:23.370
And I was just adding
the damping term

00:36:23.370 --> 00:36:26.780
as you would probably do it
to a one-dimensional equation.

00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:30.720
So therefore, let me be a
little bit more specific.

00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:37.886
In many cases, you
will find that there

00:36:37.886 --> 00:36:45.960
are two distinctly
different relaxation times.

00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:51.140
In other words, the system
will have usually at least two

00:36:51.140 --> 00:36:55.920
physically distinct
relaxation times.

00:36:55.920 --> 00:37:00.290
They are traditionally
called T1 and T2.

00:37:00.290 --> 00:37:06.835
T1 is the damping time for
population differences.

00:37:17.930 --> 00:37:21.260
So this is the damping
time to shovel population

00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:24.250
from some inverted state
or some other state

00:37:24.250 --> 00:37:27.140
into the equilibrium state.

00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:34.400
That usually
involves the removal

00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:36.490
of energy out of the system.

00:37:36.490 --> 00:37:39.740
So it's an energy decay time.

00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:44.120
And if you would inspect our
parameterization of the Bloch

00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:47.260
vector, population or
population differences

00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:50.740
are described by
the z-component,

00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:52.934
the third component
of the Bloch vector.

00:37:57.290 --> 00:38:01.620
Well, we have other
components of the Bloch vector

00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:03.350
which correspond to coherences.

00:38:06.190 --> 00:38:09.950
The off-diagonal matrix
element of the density matrix.

00:38:09.950 --> 00:38:14.590
And they're only nonzero if
you have two states populated

00:38:14.590 --> 00:38:17.540
with a value-defined
relative phase.

00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:20.170
When the system, quantum
mechanical system,

00:38:20.170 --> 00:38:24.890
loses its memory of the
phase, the r1 and r2 component

00:38:24.890 --> 00:38:27.910
of the Bloch vector go to 0.

00:38:27.910 --> 00:38:33.120
So therefore, the
time T2 is a time

00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:36.930
which describes the loss of
coherences, the dephasing

00:38:36.930 --> 00:38:38.150
times.

00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:42.800
And in most situations,
well, if you lose energy,

00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:44.860
you've also lost--
if you lose energy

00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:47.450
because you quench
a quantum state,

00:38:47.450 --> 00:38:49.120
you've also lost the phase.

00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:54.110
So therefore in general,
T2 is smaller than T1.

00:38:57.281 --> 00:39:01.370
Often by a lot.

00:39:01.370 --> 00:39:06.590
So with those remarks about
the two damping times,

00:39:06.590 --> 00:39:10.260
I can now go back to the
equation at the top, which

00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:12.690
was sort of written
with quotation marks,

00:39:12.690 --> 00:39:19.510
and write it in a more accurate
way as a matrix equation

00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:25.090
for the damping of the
components of the density

00:39:25.090 --> 00:39:28.280
matrix expressed by
the Bloch vector.

00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:30.500
In other words, the
equation of motion

00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:33.050
for the z-component
of the Bloch vector,

00:39:33.050 --> 00:39:35.570
which is describing
the population,

00:39:35.570 --> 00:39:41.880
has a coherent part, which is
this generalized precession.

00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:48.932
And then, it has a damping part,
which damps the populations

00:39:48.932 --> 00:39:54.700
to the equilibrium value
with a damping time T1.

00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:59.500
And then we have the
corresponding equations

00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:03.230
for the x and y, or the 1 or 2
component of the optical Bloch

00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:03.730
vector.

00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:13.250
We just replace the z index by
x and y from the equation above,

00:40:13.250 --> 00:40:17.952
but then we divide by a
different relaxation time, T2.

00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:27.320
So what we have
found here, these

00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:38.100
are the famous Bloch
equations, which

00:40:38.100 --> 00:40:43.100
were introduced
by Bloch in 1946.

00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:47.000
Introduced first for
magnetic resonance,

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:50.190
but they're also valid
in the optical domain.

00:40:50.190 --> 00:40:53.160
For magnetic resonance, you
have a two-level system,

00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:54.370
spin up and spin down.

00:40:54.370 --> 00:40:57.610
In the optical domain, you have
a ground and excited state.

00:40:57.610 --> 00:40:59.330
In the latter
case, they're often

00:40:59.330 --> 00:41:02.260
referred to as the
optical Bloch equations.

00:41:09.580 --> 00:41:12.870
Any questions about that?

00:41:12.870 --> 00:41:14.232
Yes, please.

00:41:14.232 --> 00:41:15.940
AUDIENCE: So what
determines [INAUDIBLE]?

00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:25.620
PROFESSOR: Well, that's
a long discussion.

00:41:25.620 --> 00:41:29.320
We spent a long time in 8.422
discussing various processes.

00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:33.610
But just to give you an example,
if you have a gas of atoms

00:41:33.610 --> 00:41:37.490
and there are slightly
inhomogeneous magnetic field,

00:41:37.490 --> 00:41:41.250
that would mean that each atom,
if you look at it as precession

00:41:41.250 --> 00:41:44.330
motion, precesses at
slightly differently rates.

00:41:44.330 --> 00:41:47.965
And the atoms will decohere.

00:41:47.965 --> 00:41:51.170
They all will eventually wind
up with a different phase,

00:41:51.170 --> 00:41:54.740
that if you look at the average
of coherence, it's equal to 0.

00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:57.970
So any form of
inhomogeneity, which

00:41:57.970 --> 00:42:00.460
is not quenching a quantum
state, which is not

00:42:00.460 --> 00:42:03.620
creating any form of
de-activation of the excited

00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:07.280
state, can actually
decohere the phase.

00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:09.460
And these are
contributions to T2.

00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:11.630
So often, contributions
to T2 come

00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:15.310
from inhomogeneous
environment, but they are not

00:42:15.310 --> 00:42:18.130
changing the
population of states.

00:42:18.130 --> 00:42:21.850
Whereas, what contributes
to T1 are often collisions.

00:42:21.850 --> 00:42:24.460
Collisions which, when an
atom in an excited state

00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:27.517
collides with the
buffer gas atom,

00:42:27.517 --> 00:42:29.850
it undergoes a transition
from the excited to the ground

00:42:29.850 --> 00:42:31.750
state.

00:42:31.750 --> 00:42:35.840
So these are two distinctly
different processes.

00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:40.440
One is really a collision
and energy transfer.

00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:45.530
Each atom has to change
its quantum state.

00:42:45.530 --> 00:42:49.020
Whereas, decoherence
can simply happen

00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:52.110
that there is a small
pertubation of the energy

00:42:52.110 --> 00:42:55.200
levels due to external fields.

00:42:55.200 --> 00:43:00.360
And then, the system as an
ensemble loses its phase.

00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:02.470
In the simplest
way, you can assume

00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:03.990
inhomogeneous broadening.

00:43:03.990 --> 00:43:07.580
But you can also assume,
if the whole ensemble

00:43:07.580 --> 00:43:12.490
is subject to
fluctuating fields,

00:43:12.490 --> 00:43:17.430
then since you don't know
how the fields exactly

00:43:17.430 --> 00:43:21.550
fluctuate after characteristic
time, you no longer have

00:43:21.550 --> 00:43:23.400
a phased coherent system.

00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:27.900
Rather, phase at a later time
is deterministically related

00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:30.110
to the phase at which
you prepared it.

00:43:30.110 --> 00:43:33.170
And that would mean the
system has dephased.

00:43:33.170 --> 00:43:37.340
And this dephasing time
is called the T2 time.

00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:38.261
Nancy.

00:43:38.261 --> 00:43:39.760
AUDIENCE: I think
I have two things.

00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:42.733
First, you said that
it's generally true

00:43:42.733 --> 00:43:45.098
that T2 is less than T1.

00:43:45.098 --> 00:43:49.287
Is it ever true that
it's not the case?

00:43:49.287 --> 00:43:49.870
PROFESSOR: Oh.

00:43:55.580 --> 00:43:57.570
There is one exception.

00:43:57.570 --> 00:44:00.070
And that's the following.

00:44:00.070 --> 00:44:04.960
Let me put it this way, every
process which contributes to T1

00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:07.290
will also contribute to T2.

00:44:07.290 --> 00:44:11.130
But there are lots of processes
which only contribute to T2.

00:44:11.130 --> 00:44:14.870
So therefore, in general,
T2 is much faster

00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:18.740
because many more processes
can contribute to it.

00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:21.747
However, now if you ask
me, is it always true?

00:44:21.747 --> 00:44:22.830
Well, there is one glitch.

00:44:22.830 --> 00:44:24.500
And this is the following.

00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:28.030
T1 is the time to
damp populations.

00:44:28.030 --> 00:44:30.950
And that's the
damping of psi square.

00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:34.260
T2 is due to the
damping of the phase.

00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:37.090
And this is actually more
a damping time of the wave

00:44:37.090 --> 00:44:38.690
function itself.

00:44:38.690 --> 00:44:41.740
And if you have a wave
function psi which

00:44:41.740 --> 00:44:44.660
is damped with a
damping time tau.

00:44:44.660 --> 00:44:49.240
Psi square is damped with
twice the damping time.

00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:52.420
So if the only process
you have is, for instance,

00:44:52.420 --> 00:44:55.910
spontaneous emission,
then you find out

00:44:55.910 --> 00:44:58.610
that the damping rate
for population is gamma.

00:44:58.610 --> 00:45:01.280
This is the definition of the
spontaneous emission rate.

00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:08.070
But the damping rate 1
over T2 is 1/2 gamma.

00:45:08.070 --> 00:45:11.650
But because simply the way
how we have defined it,

00:45:11.650 --> 00:45:14.000
one involves the square
of the wave function.

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:17.060
The other one involves
simply the wave function.

00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:19.440
So there is this
factor of 2 which

00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:26.780
can make-- by just a factor
of 2-- T1 faster than T2.

00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:30.120
But apart from this
factor of 2, if T2

00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:32.790
would be defined in a way
which would incorporate

00:45:32.790 --> 00:45:38.654
the factor of 2, then T2 would
always be faster than T1.

00:45:38.654 --> 00:45:42.056
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it
makes sense [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:42.056 --> 00:45:47.402
I can't imagine if the
system has a smaller T1,

00:45:47.402 --> 00:45:50.804
then it still has any
coherence left in it.

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.740
PROFESSOR: So maybe to
be absolutely correct,

00:45:57.740 --> 00:45:59.180
I should say this.

00:45:59.180 --> 00:46:05.040
T1 is much larger than-- is
larger or equal than T2 over 2.

00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:08.930
In general, we have
even the situation

00:46:08.930 --> 00:46:14.960
that T1 is much,
much larger than T2.

00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:17.080
But with this factor
of 2, I've incorporated

00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:20.080
this subtlety of the definition.

00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:20.770
Other questions?

00:46:20.770 --> 00:46:21.876
Yes.

00:46:21.876 --> 00:46:25.820
AUDIENCE: Just a question
about real motivation

00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:29.764
of using Bloch
equation [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:33.190 --> 00:46:36.900
I understand that [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:38.274
But you mentioned
before that you

00:46:38.274 --> 00:46:41.570
can't describe spontaneous
emission with a Hamiltonian

00:46:41.570 --> 00:46:42.070
formalism.

00:46:42.070 --> 00:46:42.695
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:46:42.695 --> 00:46:45.022
AUDIENCE: But couldn't
you use-- [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:59.066 --> 00:47:01.849
Don't you still get spontaneous
emission out of the coupling

00:47:01.849 --> 00:47:02.640
into the continuum?

00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:06.480
The emission into
the different modes?

00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:08.360
You don't necessarily
need [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:18.730
PROFESSOR: Yes, but let me
kind of remind you of this.

00:47:18.730 --> 00:47:21.650
If you are interested in
a quantum state and it

00:47:21.650 --> 00:47:23.240
decays to a level.

00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:25.340
But we're not really
interested what this level is

00:47:25.340 --> 00:47:27.215
and we're not keeping
track of the population

00:47:27.215 --> 00:47:32.630
here, when we can describe the
time evolution of the excited

00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:38.810
state with a Hamiltonian
because of the imaginary part,

00:47:38.810 --> 00:47:41.350
the Hamiltonian is
no longer imaginary.

00:47:41.350 --> 00:47:46.470
And this is what Victor
Weisskopf theory does.

00:47:46.470 --> 00:47:48.760
It looks at a system
in the excited state

00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:51.630
and looks at the time
evolution of the excited state.

00:47:51.630 --> 00:47:54.250
But if you want to include
in this description what

00:47:54.250 --> 00:47:58.570
happens in the ground state, you
are not having this situation.

00:47:58.570 --> 00:48:01.540
You have this situation.

00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:04.320
And what eventually
will happen is

00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:07.220
you can look at a pure
state which decays.

00:48:07.220 --> 00:48:09.770
And this is what is done
in Victor Weisskopf theory.

00:48:09.770 --> 00:48:12.700
But if you want to know now what
happens in the ground state,

00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:16.830
well, I'm speaking loosely,
but that's what really happens.

00:48:16.830 --> 00:48:19.950
Every spontaneous emission adds
something to the ground state,

00:48:19.950 --> 00:48:21.610
but in incoherent way.

00:48:21.610 --> 00:48:24.240
So what is being built
up in the ground state

00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:25.760
is not a wave function.

00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:28.850
It's just population which has
to be described with a density

00:48:28.850 --> 00:48:29.810
matrix.

00:48:29.810 --> 00:48:32.690
Or in other words, if you have
a coherent superposition between

00:48:32.690 --> 00:48:36.250
excited and ground state, you
cannot just say spontaneous

00:48:36.250 --> 00:48:40.730
emission is now increasing the
amplitude to be in the ground

00:48:40.730 --> 00:48:41.300
state.

00:48:41.300 --> 00:48:43.820
It really does something
fundamentally different.

00:48:43.820 --> 00:48:47.870
It puts population into the
ground state with-- I'm loosely

00:48:47.870 --> 00:48:50.110
speaking now, but
with a random phase.

00:48:50.110 --> 00:48:52.470
And this can only be
described probabilistically

00:48:52.470 --> 00:48:54.820
by using the density matrix.

00:48:54.820 --> 00:48:57.562
But what you are talking
about is actually,

00:48:57.562 --> 00:48:59.520
for the Victor Weisskopf
theory, is pretty much

00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:00.980
this part of the diagram.

00:49:00.980 --> 00:49:03.770
We prepare an excited
state, and we study it

00:49:03.770 --> 00:49:06.330
with all its glorious
details, with the many modes

00:49:06.330 --> 00:49:09.353
of the electromagnetic field
how the excited state decays.

00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:17.780
OK.

00:49:20.330 --> 00:49:31.010
Actually with that, we have
finished one big chapter

00:49:31.010 --> 00:49:34.380
of our course, which is
the general discussion

00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:39.220
of resonance, classical
resonance, and our discussion

00:49:39.220 --> 00:49:41.800
of two-level systems.

00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:45.450
AUDIENCE: But
[INAUDIBLE], wouldn't you

00:49:45.450 --> 00:49:50.184
have to do a sum over every
single mode [INAUDIBLE]?

00:49:50.184 --> 00:49:53.356
Which would be the
exact same thing

00:49:53.356 --> 00:49:58.000
you do when you do a partial
trace over the environment.

00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:01.000
Isn't the end result
sort of the same thing

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:03.488
that you have to do some
[INAUDIBLE] infinite

00:50:03.488 --> 00:50:05.440
sum and integral or
all the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:50:09.807 --> 00:50:11.140
PROFESSOR: You need a sum, but--

00:50:11.140 --> 00:50:12.550
AUDIENCE: That's where the
decoherence comes from?

00:50:12.550 --> 00:50:13.180
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:50:13.180 --> 00:50:16.940
But if you're interested in only
the decay of an excited state,

00:50:16.940 --> 00:50:19.280
it can decay in
many, many modes,

00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:25.560
but all these different
modes provide a contribution

00:50:25.560 --> 00:50:27.250
to the decay rate gamma.

00:50:27.250 --> 00:50:31.100
So at the end of the day, you
have a Hamiltonian evolution

00:50:31.100 --> 00:50:32.670
with a damping time gamma.

00:50:32.670 --> 00:50:38.280
And this damping time gamma is
the sum of the other states.

00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:45.850
So in other words, the loss
of population from the excited

00:50:45.850 --> 00:50:50.660
state, you just incorporate
it by adding a damping time

00:50:50.660 --> 00:50:54.920
to the Schrodinger
equation because you're not

00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:59.930
keeping track of the other
modes where the population goes.

00:50:59.930 --> 00:51:01.550
You're not keeping track.

00:51:01.550 --> 00:51:04.860
You just say, excited
state is lost.

00:51:04.860 --> 00:51:07.040
You're not interested
whether the atoms are now

00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:08.990
in the ground state
or some other state.

00:51:08.990 --> 00:51:13.750
All you are describing the loss
rate from the excited state.

00:51:13.750 --> 00:51:17.930
And this is possible
by simply doing--

00:51:17.930 --> 00:51:20.120
by adding damping terms to
the Schrodinger equation.

00:51:25.410 --> 00:51:28.230
In other words, what I'm saying
is actually fairly simple.

00:51:28.230 --> 00:51:30.500
If you have a coherent
state and you lose it,

00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:31.630
you just lose amplitude.

00:51:31.630 --> 00:51:33.200
what is left is coherent.

00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:35.200
When it's gone, it's gone.

00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:38.290
You have a smaller amplitude,
smaller probability.

00:51:38.290 --> 00:51:40.070
And that's simple to describe.

00:51:40.070 --> 00:51:44.110
What is harder to describe
is if you accumulate

00:51:44.110 --> 00:51:47.420
population in the ground
state and the population

00:51:47.420 --> 00:51:49.960
arrives in incoherent pieces.

00:51:49.960 --> 00:51:53.480
How to treat that, this
is more complicated.

00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:55.960
But simply the decay
of a pure state,

00:51:55.960 --> 00:51:58.530
it's just-- you have e
to the i omega t, which

00:51:58.530 --> 00:52:01.460
is a coherent evolution, and
then you add an imaginary part

00:52:01.460 --> 00:52:03.940
and this is a damping time.

00:52:03.940 --> 00:52:07.220
So what I'm saying,
it's sort of subtle

00:52:07.220 --> 00:52:10.171
but it's also very trivial.

00:52:10.171 --> 00:52:12.045
I don't know if this
addresses your question.

00:52:15.900 --> 00:52:19.330
In the end, in general
you need a density matrix.

00:52:19.330 --> 00:52:21.450
I just wanted to
sort of emphasize

00:52:21.450 --> 00:52:24.300
that there is a little bit of
decoherence where you can still

00:52:24.300 --> 00:52:26.160
get away with a wave
function description.

00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:28.500
And actually, Victor
Weisskopf theory

00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:32.060
is the wonderful example.

00:52:32.060 --> 00:52:34.870
OK, so we have
discussed resonance.

00:52:34.870 --> 00:52:38.280
Arizonans have discussed in
particular two-level systems.

00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:44.620
And if I wanted, we could now
continue with two-level systems

00:52:44.620 --> 00:52:46.980
and talk about the
wonderful things

00:52:46.980 --> 00:52:48.780
you can do with
two-level systems.

00:52:48.780 --> 00:52:51.850
Absorbing photons, emitting
photons, and all that.

00:52:51.850 --> 00:52:58.252
But let's put that on
hold for a few weeks.

00:52:58.252 --> 00:52:59.710
And I think what
we should first do

00:52:59.710 --> 00:53:04.680
is realize, where do
those levels come from?

00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:11.990
And we discuss where
those levels come form

00:53:11.990 --> 00:53:13.514
in our discussion of atoms.

00:53:23.900 --> 00:53:30.480
So our big next chapter is
now atoms or atomic structure.

00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:35.715
And we build it up
in several stages.

00:53:38.610 --> 00:53:40.930
Well, first things first.

00:53:40.930 --> 00:53:44.750
And the first things are
the big chunks of energy

00:53:44.750 --> 00:53:47.050
which define the
electronic structure.

00:53:50.460 --> 00:53:54.170
We discuss electronic structure
for one electron and two

00:53:54.170 --> 00:53:57.430
electron atoms,
hydrogen and helium.

00:53:57.430 --> 00:54:00.150
We don't go higher in
the periodic table.

00:54:04.010 --> 00:54:08.450
But then we talk about
other contributions

00:54:08.450 --> 00:54:12.860
to the energy of atoms, other
contributions to the level

00:54:12.860 --> 00:54:15.140
structure of atoms.

00:54:15.140 --> 00:54:25.542
And this will start with fine
structure, the Lamb shift.

00:54:25.542 --> 00:54:29.180
We bring in properties
of the nucleus

00:54:29.180 --> 00:54:32.990
by discussing
hyperfine structure.

00:54:32.990 --> 00:54:37.970
And then as a next
big chapter, we

00:54:37.970 --> 00:54:42.310
will learn how external
fields, magnetic fields,

00:54:42.310 --> 00:54:48.180
electric fields, and
electromagnetic fields

00:54:48.180 --> 00:54:52.010
will modify the level
structure of atoms.

00:54:52.010 --> 00:54:54.570
So by going through all
those different layers,

00:54:54.570 --> 00:55:00.030
we will arrive at a rather
complete description.

00:55:00.030 --> 00:55:02.060
If you have an atom
in the laboratory,

00:55:02.060 --> 00:55:05.070
what determines its energy
level and the transitions

00:55:05.070 --> 00:55:06.920
between those energy levels?

00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:09.550
So this is our agenda for
the next few lectures.

00:55:13.310 --> 00:55:17.920
Today, we start with single
electron atom with a hydrogen

00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:19.120
atom.

00:55:19.120 --> 00:55:24.560
And I cannot resist to start
with some quotes from Dan

00:55:24.560 --> 00:55:27.950
Kleppner, who I sometimes
call Mr. Hydrogen.

00:55:53.820 --> 00:55:59.680
So there is some beautiful
piece of writing in a reference

00:55:59.680 --> 00:56:04.720
frame in Physics Today, "The
Yin and Yang of Hydrogen."

00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:07.200
I mean, those of you who
know Dan Kleppner know

00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:11.540
that he's always said hydrogen
is the only atom, other atom he

00:56:11.540 --> 00:56:12.460
wants to work with.

00:56:12.460 --> 00:56:14.370
Other atoms are too complicated.

00:56:14.370 --> 00:56:17.740
And he studied--
actually, hydrogen

00:56:17.740 --> 00:56:20.470
was-- he did a little bit
on alkali atoms, of course,

00:56:20.470 --> 00:56:24.460
but hydrogen was
really the central part

00:56:24.460 --> 00:56:26.400
of his scientific work.

00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:28.220
Whether he studied
Rydberg states

00:56:28.220 --> 00:56:32.440
in hydrogen or Bose-Einstein
condensation in hydrogen.

00:56:32.440 --> 00:56:38.090
And this column in
Physics Today, he

00:56:38.090 --> 00:56:39.860
talks about the yin and yang.

00:56:39.860 --> 00:56:41.940
The simplicity of hydrogen.

00:56:41.940 --> 00:56:44.180
It's the simplest atom.

00:56:44.180 --> 00:56:45.840
But if you want to
work with hydrogen,

00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:48.260
you need vacuum UV
because the step

00:56:48.260 --> 00:56:52.020
from the 1s to the 2p
transition is-- Lyman-alpha

00:56:52.020 --> 00:56:54.810
is vacuum UV at 121 nanometer.

00:56:54.810 --> 00:56:58.650
So it's simple, but challenging.

00:56:58.650 --> 00:57:01.490
And hydrogen is the
most pristine atom.

00:57:01.490 --> 00:57:04.900
But for those of you who do
Bose-Einstein condensation,

00:57:04.900 --> 00:57:07.590
it's the hardest atom
to Bose condense.

00:57:07.590 --> 00:57:10.260
Because the physical
properties of hydrogen,

00:57:10.260 --> 00:57:12.170
it's simple in its structure.

00:57:12.170 --> 00:57:14.410
But the properties
of hydrogen, in

00:57:14.410 --> 00:57:16.500
particular the
collision cross-section,

00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:18.730
which is important for
evaporative cooling,

00:57:18.730 --> 00:57:21.140
is very, very unfavorable.

00:57:21.140 --> 00:57:24.450
So that's why he talks about the
yin and the yang of hydrogen.

00:57:27.450 --> 00:57:35.830
Let me just show you the
first sentence of this paper,

00:57:35.830 --> 00:57:36.940
of this reference frame.

00:57:48.836 --> 00:57:49.336
Oops.

00:57:55.350 --> 00:58:01.078
Just a technical problem to
make this fit the screen.

00:58:01.078 --> 00:58:02.915
I think I select it.

00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:24.450
What's going on?

00:58:24.450 --> 00:58:26.181
Yep.

00:58:26.181 --> 00:58:29.340
So now it's smaller.

00:58:29.340 --> 00:58:31.262
I can move it over there.

00:58:41.340 --> 00:58:42.840
Well, why don't we
read it together?

00:58:42.840 --> 00:58:47.650
It's a tribute to hydrogen,
a tribute to famous people.

00:58:47.650 --> 00:58:50.960
Viki Weisskopf was on
the faculty at MIT.

00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:53.690
I met him, but he was already
retired at this point.

00:58:53.690 --> 00:58:56.200
But then, Kleppner
interacted with him.

00:58:56.200 --> 00:58:59.520
And you see the first quote,
"To understand hydrogen

00:58:59.520 --> 00:59:02.320
is to understand
all of physics."

00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:05.460
Well, it simply says
that if you understand

00:59:05.460 --> 00:59:08.570
some of this paradigmatic
systems in physics,

00:59:08.570 --> 00:59:10.540
you understand all of physics.

00:59:10.540 --> 00:59:12.230
I would actually
say, well, you really

00:59:12.230 --> 00:59:14.085
have to understand the
harmonic oscillator,

00:59:14.085 --> 00:59:17.929
the two-level
system, and hydrogen.

00:59:17.929 --> 00:59:19.970
And maybe a little bit
about three-level systems.

00:59:19.970 --> 00:59:24.940
But if you understand,
really, those simple systems--

00:59:24.940 --> 00:59:25.940
they're not so simple.

00:59:25.940 --> 00:59:28.640
But if you understand those
so-called simple system

00:59:28.640 --> 00:59:32.230
very well in all
its glorious detail,

00:59:32.230 --> 00:59:34.210
then you have really
understood, maybe

00:59:34.210 --> 00:59:38.070
not all of physics, but a
hell of a lot of physics.

00:59:38.070 --> 00:59:41.330
And this quote goes on that,
"To understand hydrogen

00:59:41.330 --> 00:59:44.090
is to understand
all of physics."

00:59:44.090 --> 00:59:46.720
But then Viki Weisskopf
said, "Well, I

00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:49.690
wish I had understood
all of hydrogen."

00:59:49.690 --> 00:59:55.020
And this is sort of Dan's
Kleppner's wise words.

00:59:55.020 --> 00:59:59.040
For me, hydrogen holds an
almost mystical attraction.

00:59:59.040 --> 01:00:01.650
Probably because I'm among
the small band of physicists

01:00:01.650 --> 01:00:05.137
who actually confront
it, more or less, daily.

01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:11.600
So that's what we are starting
out now to talk about hydrogen.

01:00:14.890 --> 01:00:20.360
I know that a discussion of
the hydrogen atom, the solution

01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:22.820
of the Schrodinger equation
for the hydrogen atom

01:00:22.820 --> 01:00:24.670
is in all quantum
mechanics textbooks.

01:00:24.670 --> 01:00:26.300
I'm not doing it here.

01:00:26.300 --> 01:00:29.840
I rather want to give you
a few insightful comments

01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:36.040
about the structure of hydrogen,
some scaling of length scales

01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:37.860
and energy levels,
because this is

01:00:37.860 --> 01:00:40.690
something we need
later in the course.

01:00:40.690 --> 01:00:43.450
So in other words, I want to
highlight a few things which

01:00:43.450 --> 01:00:46.790
are often not emphasized
in the textbook.

01:00:46.790 --> 01:00:48.879
So let's talk about
the hydrogen atom.

01:00:58.460 --> 01:01:03.630
So the energy levels
of the hydrogen atom

01:01:03.630 --> 01:01:05.400
are described by
the Rydberg formula.

01:01:09.670 --> 01:01:15.100
This actually follows already
from the simple Bohr model.

01:01:15.100 --> 01:01:19.170
But of course, also from
the Schrodinger equation.

01:01:19.170 --> 01:01:29.150
And it says that
the energy levels--

01:01:29.150 --> 01:01:31.070
let me write it in
the following way.

01:01:33.620 --> 01:01:39.100
It depends on the electron
mass, the electron charge, h bar

01:01:39.100 --> 01:01:40.820
square.

01:01:40.820 --> 01:01:48.890
It has a reduced
mass correction.

01:01:48.890 --> 01:01:52.500
And then, n is the
principal quantum number.

01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:54.250
It scales as 1 over n squared.

01:01:57.610 --> 01:02:05.770
So this here is the
reduced mass factor.

01:02:05.770 --> 01:02:11.740
This here is called the
Rydberg constant R, sometimes

01:02:11.740 --> 01:02:16.400
with the index infinity
because it is the Rydberg

01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:19.840
constant which describes the
spectrum of a hydrogen atom

01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:23.880
where the nucleus
has infinite mass.

01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:30.790
If you include the
reduced mass correction

01:02:30.790 --> 01:02:35.650
for the mass of the
proton, then this factor

01:02:35.650 --> 01:02:38.230
which determines the
spectrum of hydrogen

01:02:38.230 --> 01:02:41.890
is called the Rydberg constant
with an index H for hydrogen.

01:02:54.820 --> 01:03:00.752
You find the electronic
eigenfunctions

01:03:00.752 --> 01:03:05.040
as the solution of
Schrodinger's equation.

01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:12.050
And the eigenfunctions
have a simple angular part,

01:03:12.050 --> 01:03:14.205
which are the
spherical harmonics.

01:03:14.205 --> 01:03:16.410
We are not talking about that.

01:03:16.410 --> 01:03:19.590
But there is a radial
part, radial wave function.

01:03:30.950 --> 01:03:36.120
So if you solve it, if you
find those wave functions,

01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:40.240
there are a number of
noteworthy results.

01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:45.180
One is in short form the
spectrum is the Rydberg

01:03:45.180 --> 01:03:47.020
constant divided by n squared.

01:03:50.750 --> 01:03:56.230
I want to talk to you
about your intuition

01:03:56.230 --> 01:03:58.330
for the size of
the hydrogen atom,

01:03:58.330 --> 01:04:01.910
or for the size of
hydrogen-like atoms.

01:04:01.910 --> 01:04:07.290
So what I want to discuss
is several important aspects

01:04:07.290 --> 01:04:10.380
about the radius or
the expectation value

01:04:10.380 --> 01:04:13.420
of the position of the electron.

01:04:13.420 --> 01:04:16.620
And it's important
to distinguish

01:04:16.620 --> 01:04:19.530
between the expectation
value for the radius

01:04:19.530 --> 01:04:21.160
and the inverse radius.

01:04:25.210 --> 01:04:27.830
The expectation
value for the radius

01:04:27.830 --> 01:04:34.400
is, well, a little
bit more complicated.

01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:41.070
1/2 1 minus l times l
plus 1 over n squared.

01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:54.000
Whereas, the result for the
inverse radius is very simple.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:58.480
What I've introduced here
is the natural length scale

01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:04.950
for the hydrogen atom
which is the Bohr radius.

01:05:04.950 --> 01:05:11.322
And just to be general,
mu is the reduced mass.

01:05:11.322 --> 01:05:12.780
So it's close to
the electron mass.

01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:26.400
Well, the one thing I
want to discuss with you--

01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:34.020
we will need leader for the
discussion of quantum defects,

01:05:34.020 --> 01:05:37.430
for field ionization
and other processes,

01:05:37.430 --> 01:05:41.610
we have to know what the
size of the wave function is.

01:05:41.610 --> 01:05:44.900
And so usually, if
you wave your hands,

01:05:44.900 --> 01:05:48.260
you would say the
expectation value of 1/r

01:05:48.260 --> 01:05:50.920
is 1 over the
expectation value or r.

01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:54.680
But there are now some
important differences.

01:05:54.680 --> 01:05:56.500
I first want to
sort of ask you, why

01:05:56.500 --> 01:05:59.160
is the expectation
value of 1/r, why

01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:01.178
does it have this
very, very simple form?

01:06:05.825 --> 01:06:06.866
AUDIENCE: Virial theorem?

01:06:06.866 --> 01:06:08.900
PROFESSOR: The Virial theorem.

01:06:08.900 --> 01:06:10.590
Yes.

01:06:10.590 --> 01:06:15.360
We know that there is a fairly
simple form for the energy

01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:16.090
eigenvalues.

01:06:16.090 --> 01:06:18.460
It's 1 over n squared.

01:06:18.460 --> 01:06:23.810
Well, Coulomb energy
e square over r.

01:06:23.810 --> 01:06:26.880
So if the only energy
of the hydrogen atom

01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:29.250
were Coulomb energy,
it's very clear

01:06:29.250 --> 01:06:32.700
that 1/r, which is proportional
to the Coulomb energy,

01:06:32.700 --> 01:06:37.780
has to have the same simple
form as the energy eigenvalue.

01:06:37.780 --> 01:06:39.860
Well, there is a
second contribution

01:06:39.860 --> 01:06:42.130
to the energy in addition
to Coulomb energy.

01:06:42.130 --> 01:06:43.620
This is kinetic energy.

01:06:43.620 --> 01:06:47.240
But due to the Virial
theorem, the kinetic energy

01:06:47.240 --> 01:06:50.030
is actually proportional
to the Coulomb energy.

01:06:50.030 --> 01:06:54.570
And therefore, the total
energy is proportional to 1/r.

01:06:54.570 --> 01:07:00.690
And therefore, 1/r has to
scale exactly as the energy.

01:07:00.690 --> 01:07:05.990
Since the energy until we
introduce fine structure is

01:07:05.990 --> 01:07:09.530
independent of l, only depends
on the principal quantum number

01:07:09.530 --> 01:07:12.730
n, we find there's
only an n-dependence.

01:07:12.730 --> 01:07:15.510
But if you would ask, what
is the expectation value

01:07:15.510 --> 01:07:16.600
for the radius?

01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:18.750
You find an l-dependence
because you're

01:07:18.750 --> 01:07:20.710
talking about a very
different quantity.

01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:29.830
So let me just summarize
what we just discussed.

01:07:29.830 --> 01:07:35.680
We have the Virial
theorem, which

01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:40.350
in general is of
the following form.

01:07:40.350 --> 01:07:42.630
If you have potential
energy which

01:07:42.630 --> 01:07:48.990
is proportional to
radius to the n,

01:07:48.990 --> 01:07:55.010
then the expectation value
for the kinetic energy

01:07:55.010 --> 01:08:00.540
is n/2 times the expectation
value for the potential energy.

01:08:00.540 --> 01:08:02.800
The most famous
example is n equals

01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:04.120
2, the harmonic oscillator.

01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:07.710
You have an equal contribution
to potential energy

01:08:07.710 --> 01:08:10.430
of the spring and
kinetic energy.

01:08:10.430 --> 01:08:12.710
Well, here for the
Coulomb problem,

01:08:12.710 --> 01:08:17.020
we discuss n equals minus 1.

01:08:17.020 --> 01:08:20.390
And therefore,
the kinetic energy

01:08:20.390 --> 01:08:24.386
is minus 1/2 times
the potential energy.

01:08:32.670 --> 01:08:41.420
So this factor of 2 appears
now in a number of relations

01:08:41.420 --> 01:08:46.670
and that's as follows.

01:08:46.670 --> 01:08:50.670
If you take the
Rydberg constant,

01:08:50.670 --> 01:08:54.970
the Rydberg constant
in CGS units

01:08:54.970 --> 01:09:03.210
is-- well, that's the Coulomb
energy at the Bohr radius.

01:09:03.210 --> 01:09:05.970
But the Rydberg
constant is 1/2 of it.

01:09:09.069 --> 01:09:22.069
So the Rydberg constant is
1/2 of another quantity,

01:09:22.069 --> 01:09:26.050
which is called 1 Hartree.

01:09:26.050 --> 01:09:27.990
We'll talk, probably
not , today,

01:09:27.990 --> 01:09:33.040
but on Monday
about atomic units,

01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:36.710
about sort of fundamental
system of units.

01:09:36.710 --> 01:09:40.750
And the fundamental way--
the fundamental energy

01:09:40.750 --> 01:09:44.490
of the hydrogen atom, the
fundamental unit of energy

01:09:44.490 --> 01:09:49.609
is whatever energy
you can construct

01:09:49.609 --> 01:09:53.590
using the electron mass, the
electron charge, and h bar.

01:09:53.590 --> 01:09:56.670
And what you get is 1 Hartree.

01:09:56.670 --> 01:10:02.180
If you ever wondered why the
Rydberg is 1/2 Hartree, what

01:10:02.180 --> 01:10:05.350
happens is in the ground
state of hydrogen,

01:10:05.350 --> 01:10:10.280
you have 1 Hartree
worth of Coulomb energy.

01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:14.720
But then because of the Virial
theorem, you have minus 1/2

01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:16.870
of it as kinetic energy.

01:10:16.870 --> 01:10:19.767
And therefore, the
binding energy in the n

01:10:19.767 --> 01:10:23.770
equals 1 ground state,
which is 1 Rydberg,

01:10:23.770 --> 01:10:25.810
is 1/2 of the Hartree.

01:10:25.810 --> 01:10:28.620
So this factor of 1/2
of the Virial theorem

01:10:28.620 --> 01:10:32.165
is responsible for this factor
of 2 for those two energies.

01:10:35.580 --> 01:10:39.120
I usually prefer SI units
for all calculations,

01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:46.710
but there's certain relations
where we should use CGS units.

01:10:46.710 --> 01:10:50.550
Just as a side remark, if
you want to go to SI units,

01:10:50.550 --> 01:10:53.860
you simply replace
the electron charge e

01:10:53.860 --> 01:10:57.440
squared by e squared
divided by 4 pi epsilon0.

01:11:10.851 --> 01:11:11.350
OK.

01:11:11.350 --> 01:11:15.010
So I've discussed
the hydrogen atom.

01:11:15.010 --> 01:11:18.860
It's also insightful
and you should actually

01:11:18.860 --> 01:11:22.950
remember that or be able to
re-derive it for yourself.

01:11:22.950 --> 01:11:29.210
How do things depend on
the nuclear charge z?

01:11:29.210 --> 01:11:32.120
Well, if you have
a nuclear charge z,

01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:39.430
the Coulomb energy
goes up by-- well,

01:11:39.430 --> 01:11:41.020
if you have a
stronger attraction.

01:11:41.020 --> 01:11:48.570
If you would go to helium
nucleus or even more

01:11:48.570 --> 01:11:51.110
highly-charged nucleus and
put one electron in it.

01:11:51.110 --> 01:11:54.240
Because of the stronger
Coulomb attraction,

01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:58.315
all the length scales
are divided by z.

01:12:00.890 --> 01:12:04.590
So everything is smaller
by a factor of z.

01:12:04.590 --> 01:12:06.750
So what does that now
imply for the energy?

01:12:09.340 --> 01:12:13.260
Well, you have a Coulomb field
which is z times stronger,

01:12:13.260 --> 01:12:17.330
but you probe it now at
a z times smaller radius.

01:12:17.330 --> 01:12:22.469
So therefore, the energies
scale with z squared.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:50.510
Let me formulate a question
because we need that later on.

01:12:50.510 --> 01:12:57.790
So if you have a
hydrogen-like atom

01:12:57.790 --> 01:13:00.850
and the electron is in a state
with principal quantum number

01:13:00.850 --> 01:13:02.040
n.

01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:04.080
And let's assume there
is no angular momentum.

01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:11.330
So what I'm writing down
for you is the probability

01:13:11.330 --> 01:13:14.470
for the electron to
be at the nucleus.

01:13:14.470 --> 01:13:16.170
This will be very
important later on

01:13:16.170 --> 01:13:19.880
when ewe discuss hyperfine
structure because hyperfine

01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:23.600
is responsible-- for
hyperfine structure, what

01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:28.630
is responsible is the fact
that the electron can overlap

01:13:28.630 --> 01:13:29.850
with the nucleus.

01:13:29.850 --> 01:13:32.280
So this factor will
appear in our discussion

01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:34.570
of hyperfine structure.

01:13:34.570 --> 01:13:43.740
And what I want to ask you is,
how does this quantity depend

01:13:43.740 --> 01:13:48.800
on the principal quantum
number n and on z?

01:13:54.190 --> 01:13:56.470
And I want to give
you four choices.

01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:21.570
Of course, for
dimensional reasons,

01:14:21.570 --> 01:14:23.480
everything is 1
over the Bohr radius

01:14:23.480 --> 01:14:25.970
cubed because it's a density.

01:14:25.970 --> 01:14:30.250
But you cannot use
dimensional analysis to guess,

01:14:30.250 --> 01:14:36.550
how do things scale
with z and with n?

01:14:36.550 --> 01:14:42.480
So here are your four choices.

01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:46.290
Does it scale with z,
z squared, z cubed?

01:14:46.290 --> 01:14:50.712
Does it scale with n
squared, n cubed, n to the 6?

01:15:03.320 --> 01:15:05.884
If you don't know it,
just make your best guess.

01:15:19.540 --> 01:15:23.240
OK, one part should be
relatively straightforward.

01:15:23.240 --> 01:15:25.700
And this is the scaling with z.

01:15:25.700 --> 01:15:27.440
Let me just stop it.

01:15:31.930 --> 01:15:49.040
So the exact answer is that z n
00 at the origin squared is pi

01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:50.960
a0 cubed.

01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:55.840
And its c cubed over n cubed.

01:15:55.840 --> 01:15:59.745
So the correct
answer is this one.

01:16:02.430 --> 01:16:11.190
Let me first say-- OK,
I gave you four choices

01:16:11.190 --> 01:16:16.460
and it's difficult to
distinguish all of them.

01:16:16.460 --> 01:16:20.200
But the first one you should
have gotten rather simply,

01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:23.590
and this is the z-scaling.

01:16:23.590 --> 01:16:30.436
Because the scaling
with z is the following,

01:16:30.436 --> 01:16:35.120
that everything-- if you write
down the Schrodinger equation,

01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:40.230
if you have z, you replace
e squared by z e squared.

01:16:40.230 --> 01:16:43.340
And I actually just mentioned
it five minutes ago,

01:16:43.340 --> 01:16:48.850
that all length scales, the
Bohr radius is h bar squared

01:16:48.850 --> 01:16:51.970
over electron mass
times e squared.

01:16:51.970 --> 01:16:55.290
It actually scales with 1/z.

01:16:55.290 --> 01:16:58.990
So if all length
scales go as 1/z,

01:16:58.990 --> 01:17:05.410
the density goes with z cubed.

01:17:05.410 --> 01:17:08.155
So therefore, one should
have immediately narrowed

01:17:08.155 --> 01:17:09.015
down the choice.

01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:13.150
It should be A or
C because they have

01:17:13.150 --> 01:17:15.450
the correct scaling with z.

01:17:15.450 --> 01:17:17.580
The scaling with
n is more subtle

01:17:17.580 --> 01:17:20.980
and there was something
surprising I learned about it.

01:17:20.980 --> 01:17:25.710
And this is what
I want to present

01:17:25.710 --> 01:17:28.780
to you in the last
three or four minutes.

01:17:28.780 --> 01:17:32.280
So the z-scaling, just remember
that the length scaling

01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:34.450
is the length scales as 1/z.

01:17:34.450 --> 01:17:36.140
Therefore, density
scale was z cubed.

01:17:40.010 --> 01:17:42.460
The interesting thing
about the length scaling

01:17:42.460 --> 01:17:44.990
is-- and I just want to draw
your attention to it because it

01:17:44.990 --> 01:17:49.460
can be confusing,
that in high torsion

01:17:49.460 --> 01:17:55.240
we have not only one length
scale, but two length scales.

01:17:55.240 --> 01:17:57.380
We have mentioned
one of it already,

01:17:57.380 --> 01:18:01.380
which is the energetic
length scale 1/r.

01:18:01.380 --> 01:18:05.680
1/r is the Coulomb energy.

01:18:05.680 --> 01:18:07.450
Because of the
Virial theorem, it's

01:18:07.450 --> 01:18:09.611
proportional to
the total energy.

01:18:09.611 --> 01:18:12.110
And that's what you know, what
you remember when you wake up

01:18:12.110 --> 01:18:14.450
in the middle of the
night out of deep sleep,

01:18:14.450 --> 01:18:20.030
that the energy of high
torsion is 1 over n squared.

01:18:20.030 --> 01:18:25.850
So therefore, this
is a0 over n squared.

01:18:25.850 --> 01:18:33.440
However, if you look at the
wave function of hydrogen,

01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:35.880
you factor out.

01:18:35.880 --> 01:18:38.120
When you solve the
radial equation,

01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:39.790
you factor out an exponential.

01:18:39.790 --> 01:18:41.870
There's sort of
polynomial and then

01:18:41.870 --> 01:18:44.430
there is an exponential decay.

01:18:44.430 --> 01:19:03.080
And the characteristic lengths
in the exponential decay

01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:13.540
of the wave function
is n e0 over z.

01:19:18.010 --> 01:19:22.200
So therefore, when we
talk about wave functions

01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:26.260
with principal quantum number
n, there are two length scale.

01:19:26.260 --> 01:19:32.140
1 over r n l scales
with n squared.

01:19:32.140 --> 01:19:34.740
But the characteristic
length scale

01:19:34.740 --> 01:19:36.880
in the exponential
part of the radial wave

01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:43.760
function scales with n
and not with n squared.

01:19:48.450 --> 01:19:52.330
And it is this exponential
part of the wave function

01:19:52.330 --> 01:20:00.690
which scales with n which is
responsible for the probability

01:20:00.690 --> 01:20:02.850
to find the electron
as the nucleus.

01:20:02.850 --> 01:20:06.850
Which, as I said before,
the z-scaling is simple

01:20:06.850 --> 01:20:09.630
but the n-scaling
is not n to the 6.

01:20:09.630 --> 01:20:11.130
It's n cubed.

01:20:18.630 --> 01:20:22.680
And this is really important.

01:20:22.680 --> 01:20:29.680
And this describes the
scaling with n for everything

01:20:29.680 --> 01:20:34.600
which depends on the presence
of the electron as a nucleus.

01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:37.510
One is the quantum
defect and the other one

01:20:37.510 --> 01:20:39.140
is the hyperfine structure.

01:20:43.940 --> 01:20:47.670
Let me just give you
one more scaling.

01:20:47.670 --> 01:20:50.200
I've discussed now what
happens for 0 angular

01:20:50.200 --> 01:20:54.030
momentum, for finite
angular momentum states,

01:20:54.030 --> 01:20:57.620
psi is proportional
to r to the l.

01:20:57.620 --> 01:21:03.640
So therefore, if you
ask, what is psi square,

01:21:03.640 --> 01:21:06.450
it scales with 2l.

01:21:06.450 --> 01:21:11.100
And at least for
large n, the n-scaling

01:21:11.100 --> 01:21:13.996
is, again, 1 over n cubed.

01:21:20.190 --> 01:21:22.747
OK, that's what I wanted
to present you today.

01:21:22.747 --> 01:21:23.330
Any questions?

01:21:30.830 --> 01:21:36.720
OK, so we meet again
on Wednesday next week.
