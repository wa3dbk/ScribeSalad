00:00:26.225 --> 00:00:30.920
PROFESSOR: Then let
me just-- I gave you

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.540
two things about
the last class, one

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:42.880
is the question about the
electron and factors of 2

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.160
and what precesses
at what frequency.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.230
Think about it, I mean,
write down for yourself

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.530
what is a magnetic
moment of an electron?

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.610
What is a magnetic moment of
a classical particles which

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.570
is one unit of angular
momentum and try to sort of re

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:03.530
derive it.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.300
The way how I did it
is deceptively simple.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.000
But whenever you
think about it, you

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.660
will get confused
about some factors.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:18.410
But this is, of course,
where I showed you here

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:23.540
is the quantum mechanical
mystery about the g-factor of 2

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.680
that you have an electron
which has one more

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.620
magneton of magnetic moment, and
you have a classical particle

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.180
which has one more magneton.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.840
The energy levels of up
and down what are the same.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.350
The energy is 1.4
megahertz per Gauss.

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.740
But the precession of
frequency of the electron

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.420
is 2 times faster than
the precession frequency

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.440
of the classical
particle, and this

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.260
is what the g-factor of 2, which
comes out of the Dirac equation

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.130
means.

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.880
And at least one
intuitive explanation

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.440
I can give you is a
frequency which is observed

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.070
as a precession frequency
in the laboratory

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.420
is the beat frequency between
two neighboring levels.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.014
And here you have
a level in between.

00:02:05.014 --> 00:02:07.180
So the beat frequency between
two neighboring levels

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.664
is 1.4 megahertz, and
here the beat frequency

00:02:09.664 --> 00:02:12.210
is 2.8 megahertz.

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:13.910
And you will actually
see that if you

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.660
take a classic system
which has much,

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.260
much larger angular
momentum, maybe L equals 10.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.790
It will have this
level structure,

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.690
but it will go from
minus 10 to plus 10.

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.020
But the precession frequency
is the beat frequency

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.840
between two levels.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.460
Or if you don't like
the word beat frequency,

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.370
it precesses and you can
increase the precession.

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:44.580
So if you're not
increasing the impression,

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.550
you can increase the energy
of the precessing system

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.250
by driving it at the
resonance frequency which

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:52.850
is a precession frequency.

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.930
And the resonance is always
the energy difference

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.220
between two levels.

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.300
So no matter how many levels
you have in a classical system

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.640
with a g-factor of 1, you're
always driving it step by step,

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.410
and each step is the
resonance and this

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.820
is the precession
frequency of the system.

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.250
Questions about it?

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.380
I know people get
confused all the time,

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.170
but just think about it.

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.160
I think I gave you all
the different angles

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.130
you can use to look at it.

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:29.210
Questions about that?

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:33.680
OK.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:40.490
Next thing I just want
to point out is rotation.

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:45.360
Yes, we are spending
quite some time in class

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.670
just to figure out that
something is rotating.

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.420
So what we figured out
here is that if you

00:03:53.420 --> 00:04:03.550
go to a rotating frame, if
you have angular momentum,

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.500
and we go to a rotating
frame, that that simply

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.570
means that the effect
of a rotating frame

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:18.720
is to simply add a
fictitious magnetic fields

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:19.930
to the real magnetic field.

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.390
Well, that's very handy.

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:29.610
For instance, we
know then immediately

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.660
if you have a real
magnetic field

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.840
and we pick the
fictitious magnetic field

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.850
in such a way that the
real magnetic field

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:39.215
that the total field cancels it.

00:04:39.215 --> 00:04:42.870
It cancels the total
magnetic field, well,

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.740
then we have a system viewed
from the rotating frame

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.780
where the effective field is 0.

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.210
Well, the spin is zero
field does nothing

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.750
and then we know when you
go back into the lab frame,

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:55.450
all this spin is
doing it rotates.

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:58.230
It's an exact solution.

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:01.670
I want to use it today again
but in a different way,

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:04.290
but I want to just
point out today

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:07.120
we will not picking the
fictitious field to make

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.990
the magnetic field zero.

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.890
Today we are talking
about what happens

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:15.620
to a spin in a rotating field.

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:16.466
Complicated.

00:05:16.466 --> 00:05:20.680
A time-dependent problem,
time-dependent Hamiltonian.

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.610
But if you go in a rotating
frame, if you rotate

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.980
with the field, then
in the rotating frame

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:29.280
it becomes a
time-independent problem

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.260
which we can immediately solve.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.490
So today we use the same
transformation again,

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:38.650
but we pick our frequency not
to cancel some static field.

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:41.850
We pick our frequency
to co-rotate

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:46.590
with an external rotating field
that in our rotating frame now

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:47.704
everything is stationary.

00:05:47.704 --> 00:05:49.370
So that's what you're
going to do today.

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:55.550
And finally just to
give you an outlook,

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:58.120
just try to sort of make you
aware that often what we're

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:01.050
doing is the same thing
in a different angle.

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:02.930
So this is one way to
deal with rotation.

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:07.590
I'll give you an exact solution
by going to rotating frame.

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:12.960
I will later show you today
that quantum mechanically

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:17.300
the solution to the Heisenberg
equation of motion for angular

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.290
momentum or magnetic
moment in a magnetic field

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:22.370
is exactly a rotation.

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:25.350
So we'll again show you that
a quantum mechanical solution,

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:29.530
the solution of a time-dependent
problem is exactly rotation.

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:36.740
And later on when we use the
spin-1/2 Hamiltonian and we

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:40.250
write down the wave function,
we solve sometimes the wave

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:42.540
function by transforming
the wave function.

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:45.840
And this will be, again, the
rotating frame transformation.

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:49.400
It's not always called like
this, but it's always the same.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.250
You go to some form
of rotating frame,

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:55.210
and we'll do that in
three different ways.

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:58.920
This is the first way just as
a general classical physics

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:01.780
transformation to
rotating frame.

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:04.600
We will do it again
for the expectation

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.340
value as a solution of
Heisenberg's equation

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:10.800
of motion, and
then we do it again

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:14.025
when we transform
the wave function

00:07:14.025 --> 00:07:15.700
with a unitary transformation.

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:23.580
A lot of time for simple
rotations, but its good thing.

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:25.080
It really provides
a lot of insight.

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:31.050
Anyway, this is more sort of
an outlook over today's lecture

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:34.200
and part of Tuesday's lecture.

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.890
Any question about the
summary and the outlook?

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:46.130
Because before I really come
back to the rotating frame,

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:52.380
I quickly want to do
something I couldn't.

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:56.900
I ran out of time on Monday.

00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:00.150
We talked so much about harmonic
oscillators, the precision

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:01.900
at which we can
determine the frequency

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:05.320
of the harmonic
oscillator, and I really

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:06.760
want to give you examples.

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:12.200
I want give you two outstanding
examples for atomic clocks.

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:21.850
And the two extreme
examples are, well,

00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:24.420
the two best atomic
clocks in the world.

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:32.020
One is the cesium atom
with a fountain clock.

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:36.030
Well, we'll talk about
it later, but some of you

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:39.299
know that the cesium atom
is hyper fine structure.

00:08:39.299 --> 00:08:42.539
In one state, the electron
and nucleus spin are parallel.

00:08:42.539 --> 00:08:44.375
In the other state,
they are antiparallel,

00:08:44.375 --> 00:08:48.560
and the transition frequency
is 10 gigahertz, well,

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:51.650
9.something, but for the
matter of this discussion,

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:54.640
it's 10 gigahertz.

00:08:54.640 --> 00:09:00.620
And the definition of time,
the definition for 1 second

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:06.110
is in terms of so-and-so many
cycles of this transition.

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:09.380
So this transition
has this frequency,

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:13.000
and for decades,
this frequency was

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.590
determined in an atomic beam.

00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:17.110
You have an atomic cesium
beam, and you interrogate it

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:19.000
with microwave fields.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.200
But now with cold atoms, we
can achieve much, much longer

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:27.320
interrogation times by
almost completely eliminating

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:28.620
the atomic motion.

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:30.400
In the current
experiment, is that you

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:33.330
have a cloud
[? lace ?] are cooled

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:34.930
to micro Kelvin temperature.

00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:37.300
You launch it into a fountain.

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:42.500
The cloud goes up and goes down,
and you interrogate it twice

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:44.940
and the interrogation
time is 1 second.

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:47.910
And this interrogation time is
no longer as in the convention

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:51.890
atomic clocks limited by the
thermal velocity of the atom,

00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:53.670
it's limited by gravity.

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:57.420
If you want to increase
a time to 10 seconds,

00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:00.360
you need a 100-meter tower and
nobody wants to build that.

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:03.780
I mean, it would be a
really big atomic clock.

00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:10.050
So therefore you usually deal
with an interrogation time

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:13.700
on the order of 1 second.

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:18.970
So we know that based
on Fourier's theorem,

00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:22.120
delta is a factor of 2
pi, but the line widths,

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:24.840
if you would recall
now the spectrum,

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:28.410
the line widths, delta omega,
would be that's a factor of 2,

00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:31.670
but it would be 1 over 1 second.

00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:37.970
And therefore the fractional
accuracy is 10 to the 11,

00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:41.960
is on the order of
10 to the minus 11.

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:48.930
However, the accuracy of
the base cesium fountains

00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:54.620
is now 10 to the minus 16.

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:59.290
So people are able to split
the line to 1 part in 100,000,

00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:04.630
which requires
exquisite knowledge,

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:06.400
exquisite knowledge
of the line shape

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:09.680
and also systematic effects,
but well, an atomic clock

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:12.180
is a piece of art.

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:17.930
And I just want to
emphasize that I sometimes

00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:20.830
feel when I talk about the
uncertainty at which you can

00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:25.135
measure a classical oscillator
or such is almost trivial,

00:11:25.135 --> 00:11:27.070
and you should
know all about it.

00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:31.590
But I can just say without
looking at anybody that I just

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:34.270
had a lunch discussion with
some of my graduate student

00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:36.810
and we talked about
laser stabilization.

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:41.320
And one graduate student asked,
but if the natural line widths

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:44.610
of a transition is 10 megahertz,
can we stabilized a laser

00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:47.070
to better than a megahertz?

00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:48.240
Of course, we can.

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:50.940
I mean, here we have a
natural line width of 10

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:53.780
to the minus 11, but we
can get an a accuracy

00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:57.710
of a signal, which is
10 to the minus 16.

00:11:57.710 --> 00:12:00.810
So a microwave oscillator,
which is the microwave accrual

00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:05.240
end of a laser can now be
locked to the cesium transition

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:08.600
with a precision of
10 to the minus 16,

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:12.560
100,000 times better
than the line width.

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:17.065
Let me give you
a second example.

00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:21.220
Just noticing the red color.

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:23.790
This is red.

00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:27.042
I wanted to highlight it.

00:12:27.042 --> 00:12:28.500
There's probably
nothing we can do.

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:32.650
It seems the projector
is not showing the color.

00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:35.160
Well, in the lecture
post, the lecture notes,

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:38.680
this will be bright
red, but maybe I

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:41.550
should use more blue
and green and yellow

00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:42.760
for highlighting it today.

00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:49.650
That's really odd.

00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:55.530
Yellow-- OK.

00:12:55.530 --> 00:12:59.160
The red is completely missing.

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:08.210
The other example I want to give
you is the strontium-- yeah,

00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:10.570
it's blue-- the
strontium optical clock.

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:18.500
And there was a
really nice paper

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:32.550
in Nature just a few
weeks ago, and well, here

00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:37.110
is a level diagram
of atomic strontium

00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:40.740
what happens is there is
a very fast transition s

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:43.770
to p transition for laser
cooling and trapping

00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:47.850
and all that, but then there
is a very, very slow transition

00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:51.460
[? forbidden ?] to a triplet
state, which is meta stable.

00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:54.070
And this transition,
those states

00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:57.030
have a very long lifetime,
and therefore this transition

00:13:57.030 --> 00:14:00.210
is extremely level.

00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:05.380
So what is state of the art
for the strontium clock?

00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:13.220
Well, in the experiment, they
use an interrogation time.

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:23.200
So they observe the
atom for delta t, which

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:27.540
is on the order of
160 milliseconds

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:31.980
and putting in the 2 pis in
the right place that would mean

00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:35.920
the frequency
resolution is 1 Hertz.

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:38.890
And you see that on
the left-hand side when

00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:43.260
we record the resonance, the
blue one is about 1 Hertz

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:44.900
and there is something broader.

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:46.690
This is when they
are not actively

00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:48.830
feeding back the magnetic field.

00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:53.000
So for this fantastic position,
you have to control everything,

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.910
but the blue line
is sort of what

00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:56.320
we record as a clock transition.

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:58.310
It's about 1 Hertz.

00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:06.030
Now, compared to a cesium
clock, the big advantage

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:13.420
is that the strontium clock
operates in the optical domain,

00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:18.404
and this is a frequency at
5 times 10 to the 14 Hertz.

00:15:18.404 --> 00:15:20.320
So we're seeing if the
frequency is much, much

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:23.910
faster even if you have a
shorter interrogation time,

00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:27.310
your relative
accuracy is better.

00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:33.250
And here the Q value
the mu over delta mu

00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:37.460
is on the order of 10
times 10 to the minus 15.

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:38.190
Fantastic.

00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:50.800
15 orders of magnitude, and they
are splitting the line, not as

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:54.800
extreme as the cesium atomic
clock by a factor of 100,000,

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:58.310
by a factor which is
on the order of 300.

00:15:58.310 --> 00:16:05.800
And with that, they have an
accuracy, which is now really

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:08.080
the record for the
base performance

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:15.255
of any atomic clock, which is
6 times 10 to the minus 18.

00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:22.260
Now, this is now in
the optical domain.

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:26.320
You may wonder about the
laser, how stable is the laser.

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:29.680
The laser is stabilized
to an optical activity,

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:34.270
but the laser because of
thermal fluctuations, not

00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:36.910
terminal fluctuations,
thermal fluctuations

00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:44.560
in the mirror because
of thermal noise

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:48.660
is limited in the short
term to 10 to the minus 16.

00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:57.440
So the short term stability
between 1 and 1,000

00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:00.250
second is 10 to the minus 16.

00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:05.109
So they use a laser which
has a stability of 10

00:17:05.109 --> 00:17:07.260
to the minus 16.

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:12.089
Every 1.3 seconds,
they take a data point.

00:17:12.089 --> 00:17:16.089
Each data point or
the spectral widths

00:17:16.089 --> 00:17:23.180
is 2 times 10 to the--
the laser is 10 to the 16.

00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:26.020
The line we record
is 10 to the 15,

00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:28.810
but seen since the thermal
noise is completely random

00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:31.834
and by averaging it, they
can determine the line center

00:17:31.834 --> 00:17:33.000
to better than 10 to the 17.

00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:39.340
So I think this just illustrates
the precision at the which

00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:42.490
you can observe the
harmonic oscillator,

00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:44.620
and what I like
about this example,

00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:49.160
it shows you that both the
transition you are recording

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:53.580
and the laser itself-- 10
to the 15, 10 to the 16--

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:57.449
are worse than the final
precision of the measurement,

00:17:57.449 --> 00:17:58.865
which is better
than 10 to the 17.

00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:07.330
Make sense, but yes,
that's what it is.

00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:08.420
Questions about that?

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:20.850
Yes, Collin.

00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:24.561
AUDIENCE: What was the accuracy
of the [INAUDIBLE] result?

00:18:27.998 --> 00:18:31.707
Was it better than 6
times 10 to the minus 18?

00:18:31.707 --> 00:18:32.290
PROFESSOR: No.

00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:34.724
This 6 times 10 to
the minus 18 is really

00:18:34.724 --> 00:18:35.682
the [INAUDIBLE] record.

00:18:35.682 --> 00:18:38.944
AUDIENCE: Is that the
[? atomic ?] clock?

00:18:38.944 --> 00:18:42.350
PROFESSOR: There was an
aluminum ion clock, which had,

00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:44.469
I think, 10 the
minus 17 precision.

00:18:44.469 --> 00:18:47.010
But I think it's 6 times 10 to
the minus 18 is close to that.

00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:49.166
So they are close or
they are better now

00:18:49.166 --> 00:18:54.160
than the aluminum clock, but the
aluminum clock is a single ion.

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:56.370
You have to ever reach
for much, much longer time

00:18:56.370 --> 00:18:58.310
to get this precision.

00:18:58.310 --> 00:19:01.600
So that's a big advantage for
the strontium clock, which

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:04.900
is many, many atoms
in an optical lattice,

00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:07.570
and they say that they
have improved on the best

00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:10.980
previous lattice clock
by a factor of 20.

00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:14.230
But I think the
improvement effect of 20,

00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:18.380
you always have to distinguish
between sensitivity

00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:19.740
and absolute precision.

00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:21.776
In the absolute
precision, you also

00:19:21.776 --> 00:19:24.090
have to control all
systematic effects.

00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:26.110
And the big step
here which was really

00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:29.420
boosting the absolute
precision was they completely

00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:32.760
controlled the black
body environment.

00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:35.830
So you really have to know
with high precision what

00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:39.610
is the effective temperature
of the black body radiation

00:19:39.610 --> 00:19:42.340
because at the 10 to
the minus 18 level,

00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:44.860
it causes a shift of
the atomic resonance.

00:19:47.890 --> 00:19:51.270
We talk later about it, but
it's the ac Stark effect

00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:53.430
of the black body
radiation, which

00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:57.177
becomes an important systematic
at that level of precision.

00:19:57.177 --> 00:19:59.760
I don't know exactly the number
of the previous atomic clocks,

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:02.280
but this is sort of
now the gold standard

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:04.300
of frequency methodology.

00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:11.490
OK.

00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:12.250
Let's go.

00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:18.610
Yes, what you have
here is you have

00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:21.140
sort of classical
harmonic oscillator,

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:23.130
but the classical
harmonic oscillator

00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:27.290
is based on doing measurements
on seamless strontium

00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:29.890
atoms and single cesium atoms.

00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:32.860
So you see that the accuracy,
and we had a discussion on it

00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:35.720
last class, the accuracy
at which you can observe

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:37.320
a quantum mechanical oscillator.

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:41.000
In a classical oscillator,
it's pretty much the same.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.610
It's the same kind of-- if you
have a good signal to noise,

00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:50.047
you can improve your
precision for the line center

00:20:50.047 --> 00:20:50.630
substantially.

00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:57.830
From those results, and
exciting atomic clocks,

00:20:57.830 --> 00:21:00.480
let's go back to
classical physics.

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:06.410
So we want to go back to our
classical magnetic moment

00:21:06.410 --> 00:21:11.920
and understand the motion of it.

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:15.300
But in addition to what
we discussed so far,

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:17.945
a stationary magnetic
field, we now

00:21:17.945 --> 00:21:20.280
want to add to it a
rotating magnetic field.

00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:50.860
So the situation
is that-- just use

00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:56.270
another color-- we
have a magnetic moment.

00:21:56.270 --> 00:22:04.690
We assume it's classical,
and we have a magnetic field,

00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:10.980
which we assume points
along the z-axis.

00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:13.410
And then, of
course, we know that

00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:16.530
from our previous
discussion that the spin

00:22:16.530 --> 00:22:18.420
undergoes precession.

00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:23.130
It's sort of precesses
around the magnetic field

00:22:23.130 --> 00:22:24.140
at the Larmor frequency.

00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:46.070
And now, let's assume we
have-- the yellow shows up.

00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:48.570
We have a rotating field.

00:22:48.570 --> 00:22:52.580
We add a rotating
field eight B1,

00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:55.550
and just to keep
things simple, we

00:22:55.550 --> 00:23:00.330
want to assume that the
rotating field rotates

00:23:00.330 --> 00:23:03.280
at the same frequency
as a magnetic moment,

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:06.310
so we are on a resonance.

00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:13.430
Because what happens
now is we can simply

00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:16.690
do a transformation
to the rotating frame.

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:26.390
The rotating frame is now
at the Larmor frequency

00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:31.730
and we have just learned that in
the rotating frame, of course,

00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:38.120
in the rotating frame the
rotating field stands still,

00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:43.190
so it becomes a
static field which

00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:45.705
points in the x direction.

00:23:52.850 --> 00:23:58.620
And we have the static
field in the z direction,

00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:01.280
but now that's what
I just reviewed.

00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:06.840
We have a fictitious
magnetic field,

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:09.560
which comes from the
transformation to the rotating

00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:14.290
frame and on resonance,
at the Larmor frequency,

00:24:14.290 --> 00:24:17.085
this is exactly the
negative of B naught.

00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:27.660
So in other words,
we started out

00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:33.160
to expose a magnetic moment
to a time-dependent field.

00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:54.010
So we had a rotating field
cosine omega Lt sine omega Lt.

00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:04.790
But in the rotating frame,
this becomes now the x prime x,

00:25:04.790 --> 00:25:06.800
and it's stationary
in the rotating frame.

00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:15.360
So this was the field
in the lab frame.

00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:31.770
In the rotating frame, we
have an effective field,

00:25:31.770 --> 00:25:34.590
which is the field
in the lab frame

00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:40.850
minus the fictitious field,
and the fictitious field

00:25:40.850 --> 00:25:42.240
was given by that.

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:45.750
It just cancels the
B naught component.

00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:51.150
And in the rotating frame,
this vector and this vector

00:25:51.150 --> 00:25:55.250
cancels and we are just left
with a field of strengths

00:25:55.250 --> 00:26:03.930
B1, which points in
the x-axis, or actually

00:26:03.930 --> 00:26:08.410
the x-axis in the rotating
frame is what I call x prime.

00:26:08.410 --> 00:26:11.240
So therefore, we have
a very simple problem

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:13.140
that in the rotating frame.

00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:18.200
We have a static
field of value B1.

00:26:22.839 --> 00:26:24.630
And the good thing is,
we know already what

00:26:24.630 --> 00:26:28.240
a magnetic moment does
with a static field.

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:30.140
The magnetic moment
is just precessing

00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:33.190
around the static
magnetic field.

00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:35.850
So therefore, our
solution is now

00:26:35.850 --> 00:26:39.020
we have transformed the
time-dependent field

00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:53.040
and now we know that mu
precesses around this field,

00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:57.240
and the precession frequency
is the Rabi frequency, which

00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:58.970
we discussed previously.

00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:10.310
The Rabi frequency is the
gyromagnetic ratio times B1.

00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:13.080
So therefore, if
we would start out

00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:19.670
with a magnetic moment
aligned with the z-axis.

00:27:19.670 --> 00:27:25.200
If we would wait
half a Rabi's cycle,

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:28.885
the magnetic moment
would now be inverted.

00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:34.800
So the situation is we have
a magnetic moment which

00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:38.010
points in the z-axis with
a field in the z-axis.

00:27:38.010 --> 00:27:41.440
But we expose it
to a rotating field

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:43.270
which rotates in the xy plane.

00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:50.240
So in the rotating frame,
we have a stationary field

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:52.970
which points in x.

00:27:52.970 --> 00:27:56.010
In this rotating frame,
the spin is simply

00:27:56.010 --> 00:28:00.030
precessing around what
is now a steady field,

00:28:00.030 --> 00:28:04.550
and after half a Ravi
cycle, the spin points down.

00:28:04.550 --> 00:28:07.680
So therefore we know--
going back to lab frame--

00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:12.660
that this rotating field has
caused in quantum mechanics

00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:15.770
I would say a spin
flip, a full reversal

00:28:15.770 --> 00:28:19.290
of the magnetic
moment, and this is

00:28:19.290 --> 00:28:23.750
what we call the pi
pulse-- it has already

00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:29.810
rotated the spin by pi--
or we call it a spin flip,

00:28:29.810 --> 00:28:32.030
but it's a completely
classical system.

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:38.480
Any questions?

00:28:48.430 --> 00:28:51.660
Well, then I would
question for you.

00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:58.180
I've discussed with you the case
that the rotating field rotates

00:28:58.180 --> 00:29:01.660
at the Larmor frequency.

00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:13.530
But now I want to discuss the
case that the rotating field is

00:29:13.530 --> 00:29:16.680
not at the Larmor
frequency, it's

00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:30.520
at the frequency omega
1, which is faster

00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:31.625
than the Larmor frequency.

00:29:37.850 --> 00:29:41.150
And the question
is now what will

00:29:41.150 --> 00:29:44.590
happen to the spin or
the magnetic moment.

00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:48.810
I explained to you
that on a resonance,

00:29:48.810 --> 00:29:54.690
the magnetic moment was
just flipping over, rotating

00:29:54.690 --> 00:29:59.040
precessing at the
Rabi frequency.

00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:02.350
And I want you to think
about it for a moment

00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:05.870
and then decide if
we go off resonant,

00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:08.660
if we drive this system
away from the resonance

00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:11.320
with a rotating field which
is faster than the Larmor

00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:18.260
frequency, what is
now the oscillation

00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:23.575
frequency of the
magnetic moment.

00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:44.860
And so the choices are, is it
larger, smaller, or the same?

00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:51.560
And this was, of course,
compared to the Rabi frequency.

00:30:58.780 --> 00:31:03.860
So I've explained to you
that the spin flip, the Rabi

00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:07.000
flopping, or the pi
pulse-- and this picture

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:12.520
was at the magnetic moment--
does Rabi flopping rotates

00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:18.260
plus z minus, z plus, z minus,
z at the Rabi frequency.

00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:20.930
But now we drive
the system faster

00:31:20.930 --> 00:31:23.230
than the Larmor frequency
and the question

00:31:23.230 --> 00:31:26.410
is, is whatever this
magnetic moment does,

00:31:26.410 --> 00:31:28.657
is it faster, slower,
or does it always

00:31:28.657 --> 00:31:29.865
happen at the Rabi frequency?

00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:45.220
Larger.

00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:45.720
Good.

00:31:48.910 --> 00:31:53.630
Well, let me then immediately
add another twist.

00:31:53.630 --> 00:31:56.890
What would happen-- let's
ask the same question,

00:31:56.890 --> 00:32:00.315
but now we are driving
it at a lower frequency.

00:32:03.692 --> 00:32:04.686
The yellow.

00:32:09.670 --> 00:32:11.090
This projector has a problem.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:20.280
So now same question
as before, but instead

00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:23.980
of driving the system with a
faster rotating field, faster

00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:27.170
than the Larmor frequency,
we are driving it

00:32:27.170 --> 00:32:29.330
with a smaller frequency.

00:32:29.330 --> 00:32:32.770
Is now the response of
the magnetic moment,

00:32:32.770 --> 00:32:36.730
the effective precession
frequency, larger, smaller,

00:32:36.730 --> 00:32:40.430
or the same as the Rabi
frequency as the resonant case?

00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:52.190
OK, good.

00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:56.320
So that means I can go very
quickly about the explanation.

00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:57.210
It's correct.

00:32:57.210 --> 00:33:00.450
Whenever you are off
resonant, this system

00:33:00.450 --> 00:33:04.970
precesses faster,
so let me summarize

00:33:04.970 --> 00:33:08.420
what probably is
obvious to all of you.

00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:13.110
What happens when we have an
off-resonant rotating field.

00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:20.870
When we have an
off-resonant rotating field,

00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:25.370
we go to the rotating frame, but
of course, the rotating frame

00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:29.420
we go to is now not rotating
at the Larmor frequency

00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:31.620
because the purpose of
going to rotating frame

00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:33.860
is get rid of the time
dependence of the rotating

00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:34.540
field.

00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:37.070
So we go to rotating
frame which rotates

00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:40.820
at the frequency of
the rotating field.

00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:56.515
So if the rotating field
rotates at a frequency omega,

00:33:56.515 --> 00:34:01.210
we have a fictitious field,
which is omega over gamma.

00:34:01.210 --> 00:34:02.715
Gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio.

00:34:06.570 --> 00:34:11.750
For the resonant case, we
were just completely canceling

00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:14.030
the static field
in the z direction,

00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:16.750
but for the
off-resonant case, when

00:34:16.750 --> 00:34:21.480
omega is larger or
smaller in both cases,

00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:26.690
this one here is no longer 0.

00:34:26.690 --> 00:34:33.139
And our total
effective field is now

00:34:33.139 --> 00:34:42.630
the quadrature sum of what
we have in the z direction,

00:34:42.630 --> 00:34:46.360
and what we have in the x
direction or x prime direction,

00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:46.889
this is B1.

00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:54.429
So in the z direction,
we have the static field

00:34:54.429 --> 00:35:02.960
minus the fictitious field
and then the two are added up

00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:06.320
On resonance, the angle
theta is 90 degrees,

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:09.480
but for the off-resonant
case, the angle

00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:18.720
is different given by the
simple geometric result.

00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:28.910
And the effective field is the
quadrature sum of B1 squared

00:35:28.910 --> 00:35:50.120
plus B naught
minus-- and the fact

00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:54.270
is this adds something to the
effective field in the rotating

00:35:54.270 --> 00:35:57.490
frame whether we drive it
above or below resonance.

00:35:57.490 --> 00:36:10.070
So therefore the
magnetic moment precesses

00:36:10.070 --> 00:36:18.500
at what is called
the generalized Rabi

00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:34.200
frequency, which I now call--
this would be red-- let's use

00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:41.420
green instead-- the generalized
Rabi frequency, which

00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:50.620
is gamma times B
effective, and this

00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:59.830
is the quadrature
sum of the detuning

00:36:59.830 --> 00:37:07.310
plus the capital
letter omega, omega R,

00:37:07.310 --> 00:37:10.120
is the Rabi frequency
at resonance,

00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:13.440
and this is nothing else
than a measure for the drive

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:17.130
field for the strengths of the
drive field B1 in frequencies.

00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:22.820
So therefore, the
generalized Rabi frequency

00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:27.110
is the resonant Rabi
frequency added in quadrature

00:37:27.110 --> 00:37:28.330
with the detuning squared.

00:37:40.460 --> 00:37:41.515
Any questions?

00:37:47.770 --> 00:37:55.140
So because it's an exact result
and I like the result Rabi

00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:58.140
flopping at the
generalized Rabi frequency,

00:37:58.140 --> 00:38:01.160
I want to derive it for you.

00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:06.430
So I want to figure out what
is the dynamic of a spin which

00:38:06.430 --> 00:38:13.400
is originally
aligned, and now it

00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:18.830
undergoes-- it is driven
by the rotating field.

00:38:18.830 --> 00:38:21.770
Remember, the resonant
case was very simple.

00:38:21.770 --> 00:38:24.160
The spin was just
doing Rabi flopping.

00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:27.540
It was fully inverted,
came back, and just

00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:30.980
did this at that Rabi frequency.

00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:33.880
Now we know that in
the off-resonant case,

00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:36.690
there will be an
effective magnetic field

00:38:36.690 --> 00:38:39.740
and it will precess at a
faster frequency, which

00:38:39.740 --> 00:38:46.620
is a generalized
Rabi frequency, but

00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:51.940
since the effective magnetic
field is not transverse,

00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:59.440
it has a z component, the
spin will never fully invert.

00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:02.180
So geometrically,
it's very easy.

00:39:02.180 --> 00:39:06.820
We start out with a magnetic
moment at zero time,

00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:10.530
and I can immediately draw
to you the complete solution.

00:39:10.530 --> 00:39:18.710
The complete solution is that
in the rotating frame, this sort

00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:26.130
of precesses around the
effective magnetic field.

00:39:26.130 --> 00:39:27.780
This is the solution.

00:39:27.780 --> 00:39:29.900
But I just wanted to do
is because it takes me

00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:32.690
three or four minutes, I
want to read from this graph,

00:39:32.690 --> 00:39:37.110
from this drawing, one of
two trigonometric identities

00:39:37.110 --> 00:39:40.980
and derive for you the
explicit expression,

00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:42.850
what is the value of
the magnetic moment

00:39:42.850 --> 00:39:45.940
as a function of time.

00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:49.980
But it's clear from that it
will have a maximum value.

00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:53.000
It precesses around
the tilt direction,

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:56.020
and when it's over there,
it has a minimum value,

00:39:56.020 --> 00:39:59.520
but it will never
completely invert.

00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:02.400
Well, quantum mechanically,
if you drive a system not

00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:06.100
on resonance, you
cannot completely invert

00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:10.220
the population, but
we'll come to the later.

00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:11.750
So what do I need?

00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:19.675
Well, the spin is
moving here on a circle.

00:40:24.110 --> 00:40:25.910
I need a few angles.

00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:34.210
So let's say the spin
was here at one time.

00:40:34.210 --> 00:40:38.030
At another time, it
is there, and that

00:40:38.030 --> 00:40:44.740
would mean that on the circle,
it has moved an angle phi.

00:40:47.350 --> 00:40:53.300
The tilt angle between the
spin and the magnetic field

00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:56.650
is what I call theta.

00:40:56.650 --> 00:41:06.080
And the angle between the
initial magnetic moment

00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:12.810
and the magnetic moment at
time, t, is what I call alpha.

00:41:15.122 --> 00:41:16.955
Yeah, these other the
three relevant angles.

00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:28.060
The tip of the magnetic
moment goes in a circle,

00:41:28.060 --> 00:41:41.490
and this circle has a radius,
which is mu times sine theta.

00:41:41.490 --> 00:41:48.600
Sine theta is nothing else than
the rotating magnetic field

00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:51.890
over the effective
magnetic field, which

00:41:51.890 --> 00:41:58.680
is nothing else than the
resonant Rabi frequency divided

00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:00.165
by the generalized
Rabi frequency.

00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:16.110
I said what I want
to determinant

00:42:16.110 --> 00:42:24.850
is the magnetic moment in
the z direction as a function

00:42:24.850 --> 00:42:30.500
of time, and for that, I
defined the angle cosine alpha.

00:42:37.870 --> 00:42:43.080
So the way how I derive it
the easiest way, its geometry,

00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:45.930
its three dimension, and
triangles, and all that.

00:42:45.930 --> 00:42:53.410
But the best way how I
can describe it for you,

00:42:53.410 --> 00:42:58.360
let me introduce this auxiliary
line, which connects the tip

00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:02.780
of the magnetic moment at
time t equals 0 and at time t.

00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:06.480
And I call the length
of this line A.

00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:13.230
And I want to derive-- I want
to have now two triangles where

00:43:13.230 --> 00:43:16.880
one side is A, determine
A in two different ways,

00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:19.550
combine the equation,
we are done.

00:43:19.550 --> 00:43:26.400
So the first way is that
we have the magnetic moment

00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:31.160
at time 0, the magnetic
moment at time, t.

00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:34.880
We said the angle is
alpha, and the two tips

00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:50.640
are connected by A, and you know
in every triangle you have this

00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:56.010
would Pythagoras, but
in the general case,

00:43:56.010 --> 00:43:58.980
this is valid for
general triangle.

00:43:58.980 --> 00:44:03.600
So applying that to this
triangle, we have a square.

00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:07.210
b square is mu square.
c square is mu square,

00:44:07.210 --> 00:44:10.470
so we get 2 mu square.

00:44:10.470 --> 00:44:17.780
And then this term 2 ab is 2
mu times mu times cosine alpha,

00:44:17.780 --> 00:44:21.930
so therefore, this is
1 minus cosine alpha.

00:44:21.930 --> 00:44:23.820
So we've taken care
of the first triangle.

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:34.560
I hope the drawing is
not completely confusing

00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:36.450
at this point, but
why don't we just

00:44:36.450 --> 00:44:41.380
look at the drawing looking
down the effective field.

00:44:41.380 --> 00:44:43.500
We look down at
the effective field

00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:48.050
and then we see the circle where
the magnetic moment precesses,

00:44:48.050 --> 00:44:52.990
and the radius of the circle
I've already given to you.

00:44:52.990 --> 00:44:58.410
So now we want to look down
the effective magnetic moment.

00:44:58.410 --> 00:45:01.800
We see the circle.

00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:04.170
We want to lock down the
effective magnetic field.

00:45:04.170 --> 00:45:07.495
We see the circular where the
magnetic moment precesses.

00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:14.730
It's has precessed
form here to there.

00:45:14.730 --> 00:45:16.350
We connect this line.

00:45:16.350 --> 00:45:25.700
This was our A, and the angle
at which the magnetic moment

00:45:25.700 --> 00:45:28.730
has precesses is phi.

00:45:28.730 --> 00:45:35.810
And the radius as we derived
before was mu times sine theta.

00:45:35.810 --> 00:45:40.250
So now just using the same
equation for this triangle,

00:45:40.250 --> 00:45:47.170
we find that A square is 2
mu square sine square theta

00:45:47.170 --> 00:45:52.040
times 1 minus cosine phi.

00:45:54.570 --> 00:46:01.490
And for cosine phi, I want
to use the trig identity

00:46:01.490 --> 00:46:06.820
and express it by
half the angle.

00:46:06.820 --> 00:46:08.610
All right, now we are done.

00:46:08.610 --> 00:46:10.225
We're pretty much
looking at this--

00:46:10.225 --> 00:46:14.360
the drawing is clear
precession around a tilt angle,

00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:16.510
and we're just
doing geometry here.

00:46:16.510 --> 00:46:20.540
And we have now two
expressions for A square.

00:46:20.540 --> 00:46:25.930
We can set the two
expression equal

00:46:25.930 --> 00:46:34.140
and solve for the unknown,
which is cosine over [? phi. ?]

00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:37.320
And with that, we
find the cosine alpha

00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:47.375
is 1 minus 2 sine square
theta sine square phi over 2.

00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:58.590
And the purpose of this exercise
was that cosine alpha tells us

00:46:58.590 --> 00:47:01.750
the tilt angle of the
magnetic moment away form

00:47:01.750 --> 00:47:05.000
the vertical axis,
so therefore, we

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:07.450
have done what we wanted to do.

00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:15.190
We know the z component
of the magnetic moment

00:47:15.190 --> 00:47:24.970
as a function of
time is this times 1

00:47:24.970 --> 00:47:34.415
minus generalized Rabi frequency
squared times sine square.

00:47:37.710 --> 00:47:42.550
And now we know the precession
phi, the precession at which

00:47:42.550 --> 00:47:46.280
the keep of the magnetic
moment moves in a circle,

00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:49.640
we discussed it already before,
and you gave the correct answer

00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:51.720
with the clicker,
is this generalized

00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:56.070
Rabi frequency omega Rabi.

00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:04.060
So that's a nice formula, but
before we lean back and look

00:48:04.060 --> 00:48:08.200
at it, let me just
do one tiny step.

00:48:13.490 --> 00:48:16.380
Based on our quantum
mechanical background,

00:48:16.380 --> 00:48:37.560
we can now define that the
probability that the spin has

00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:45.820
been flipped is the
relative difference

00:48:45.820 --> 00:48:51.230
in the z component
appropriately normalized.

00:48:51.230 --> 00:48:54.170
This is just the normalized
change in the z component,

00:48:54.170 --> 00:48:58.271
and if I call that
the probability that,

00:48:58.271 --> 00:49:00.820
that which is on
the left-hand side,

00:49:00.820 --> 00:49:07.110
then I find that the probability
for this classically expression

00:49:07.110 --> 00:49:10.840
for which expresses how much
the z component of the magnetic

00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:25.660
moment has changed, and this is
exactly the celebrated formula

00:49:25.660 --> 00:49:28.445
for spin flips in
a spin-1/2 system.

00:49:42.330 --> 00:49:48.370
So we have derived
exactly the solution

00:49:48.370 --> 00:49:54.080
for the motion for the
precession of a magnetic moment

00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:59.030
in a magnetic field plus
the rotating magnetic field,

00:49:59.030 --> 00:50:02.410
and what we found is, we
found that the magnetic moment

00:50:02.410 --> 00:50:06.610
precesses at the
generalized Rabi frequency.

00:50:06.610 --> 00:50:09.890
And as I will show
you next week,

00:50:09.890 --> 00:50:12.450
this result is
exactly the same as

00:50:12.450 --> 00:50:16.650
for quantum mechanical
expectation values.

00:50:16.650 --> 00:50:17.553
Question, yeah?

00:50:17.553 --> 00:50:20.692
AUDIENCE: So what if we have
magnetic field oscillating just

00:50:20.692 --> 00:50:24.315
in one direction instead of
rotation magnetic fields?

00:50:24.315 --> 00:50:27.190
PROFESSOR: Oh, that's a much
more complicated problem.

00:50:27.190 --> 00:50:30.620
What happens when we have
the magnetic field which

00:50:30.620 --> 00:50:33.130
is linearly polarized,
which is only

00:50:33.130 --> 00:50:35.190
oscillating in one direction?

00:50:35.190 --> 00:50:40.030
Well, light or a vector
which is oscillating linearly

00:50:40.030 --> 00:50:44.240
in one direction can be
regarded as a superposition

00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:47.400
of a left and right
rotating field.

00:50:47.400 --> 00:50:50.460
In other words, if you
superimpose left-handed

00:50:50.460 --> 00:50:53.030
and right-handed
circular polarized light,

00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:56.290
the sum of the two is
linearly polarized light.

00:50:56.290 --> 00:50:59.070
So now we have
actually the situation

00:50:59.070 --> 00:51:02.327
that linearly polarized
magnetic field-- that's

00:51:02.327 --> 00:51:03.660
what we usually do when the lab.

00:51:03.660 --> 00:51:05.100
I mean, we have coils.

00:51:05.100 --> 00:51:08.430
We connect them to
synthesizer and the field

00:51:08.430 --> 00:51:09.810
is not going in a circle.

00:51:09.810 --> 00:51:11.080
It's going back and forth.

00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:12.590
It's linearly polarized.

00:51:12.590 --> 00:51:16.910
This corresponds
to a magnetic field

00:51:16.910 --> 00:51:20.730
which corresponds to
two magnetic field, one

00:51:20.730 --> 00:51:24.460
rotates left and
one rotates right.

00:51:24.460 --> 00:51:26.875
But the problem is if you
now do a transformation

00:51:26.875 --> 00:51:29.230
in the rotating
frame, do we want

00:51:29.230 --> 00:51:32.970
to rotate omega to the
left or omega to the right?

00:51:32.970 --> 00:51:36.870
So what we can do is, we
can pick our rotating frame

00:51:36.870 --> 00:51:39.830
and we are now in
the rotating frame.

00:51:39.830 --> 00:51:43.280
One of the rotating fields
has become time independent,

00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:45.780
the other rotates
now at 2 omega.

00:51:48.540 --> 00:51:52.040
And at that point, we need
the celebrated rotating wave

00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:55.770
approximation that we keep the
one term [? via ?] rectified

00:51:55.770 --> 00:51:58.120
and the other one
at two omega rotates

00:51:58.120 --> 00:52:01.430
so rapidly that we say these
rapid oscillations do nothing

00:52:01.430 --> 00:52:03.760
and we discard it.

00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:05.440
We'll discussed it
later in this course.

00:52:07.970 --> 00:52:11.340
But the gist is, if you
have linearly-polarized

00:52:11.340 --> 00:52:13.940
light, linearly-polarized
magnetic fields,

00:52:13.940 --> 00:52:17.110
we usually have to do an
additional approximation,

00:52:17.110 --> 00:52:18.950
the rotating wave approximation.

00:52:18.950 --> 00:52:22.090
And since the rotating wave
approximation is done always

00:52:22.090 --> 00:52:25.030
in almost any treatment,
any paper you can find,

00:52:25.030 --> 00:52:27.350
we think it's always necessary.

00:52:27.350 --> 00:52:30.580
But what I've shown to you is,
when we have a rotating field,

00:52:30.580 --> 00:52:32.330
we don't need any approximation.

00:52:32.330 --> 00:52:37.780
The transformation in the
rotating frame is exact,

00:52:37.780 --> 00:52:41.170
but that's the beauty of it the
when we assume rotating frames,

00:52:41.170 --> 00:52:44.540
we can hold on to exact
solutions for longer and only

00:52:44.540 --> 00:52:48.450
later then discuss what
happens when we introduce

00:52:48.450 --> 00:52:51.210
linearly-polarized
magnetic fields.

00:52:55.370 --> 00:52:57.310
But that's something
we definitely

00:52:57.310 --> 00:53:00.870
do later in its full beauty.

00:53:00.870 --> 00:53:02.190
15 minutes.

00:53:07.260 --> 00:53:07.760
OK.

00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:12.792
There's one thing I want
to do about classical spins

00:53:12.792 --> 00:53:14.750
and then we do with the
full quantum treatment.

00:53:18.220 --> 00:53:21.800
And this aspect
of classical spins

00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:24.720
is called rapid
adiabatic passage.

00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:50.340
So we want to add one more
piece to our discussion.

00:53:50.340 --> 00:53:55.360
So far we have assumed a static
field and a rotating field,

00:53:55.360 --> 00:53:58.040
which rotates at one frequency.

00:53:58.040 --> 00:54:01.240
But now we want to change
the frequency of the rotating

00:54:01.240 --> 00:54:02.280
field.

00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:06.300
So we have our magnetic moment
in a static magnetic field,

00:54:06.300 --> 00:54:08.380
which is our quantization axis.

00:54:08.380 --> 00:54:10.260
And now we have
a rotating field,

00:54:10.260 --> 00:54:13.640
but we increase the frequency
of the rotating field from slow

00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:16.670
to fast and ask what happens.

00:54:16.670 --> 00:54:20.460
And the result is that by
increasing the frequency,

00:54:20.460 --> 00:54:23.230
sweeping the frequency
through the resonance,

00:54:23.230 --> 00:54:25.510
we can do something very useful.

00:54:25.510 --> 00:54:27.890
We can invert the spin.

00:54:27.890 --> 00:54:32.220
We can turn over the magnetic
moment in a very robust way,

00:54:32.220 --> 00:54:35.550
and this is the concept of
rapid adiabatic passage.

00:54:35.550 --> 00:54:38.550
A lot of you may be
familiar with the concept

00:54:38.550 --> 00:54:40.920
a Landau-Zener
transition, what I'm

00:54:40.920 --> 00:54:44.790
telling you what is exactly
the classical counterpart

00:54:44.790 --> 00:54:46.700
of the Landau-Zener transition.

00:54:46.700 --> 00:54:49.770
actually in many cases when
it comes to spin physics,

00:54:49.770 --> 00:54:53.030
the classical physics and the
quantum physics is the same.

00:54:53.030 --> 00:54:56.430
So that's why I want to
discuss rapid adiabatic passage

00:54:56.430 --> 00:55:03.970
and Landau-Zener physics first
in the classical environment.

00:55:03.970 --> 00:55:09.610
So rapid adiabatic
passage is a technique

00:55:09.610 --> 00:55:20.800
for inverting turning around
spins or magnetic moments

00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:28.550
by sweeping the frequency
of your drive field

00:55:28.550 --> 00:55:29.980
across the resonance.

00:55:36.160 --> 00:55:48.875
So adiabatic means that this
frequency sweep has to be slow.

00:55:53.800 --> 00:55:59.905
Slow is slow compared
to the Larmor frequency.

00:56:04.810 --> 00:56:08.080
We get any given moment the
magnetic moment precesses

00:56:08.080 --> 00:56:14.360
at the Larmor frequency, which
is the gyromagnetic ratio

00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:17.030
times g-factor
magnetic field, so it's

00:56:17.030 --> 00:56:18.970
sort of quasi stationary.

00:56:18.970 --> 00:56:22.450
The spin precesses around
the effective magnetic field

00:56:22.450 --> 00:56:25.700
and we want to change the
frequency of the drive

00:56:25.700 --> 00:56:29.820
slow compared to that motion.

00:56:29.820 --> 00:56:31.940
Well, the word rapid
adiabatic passage

00:56:31.940 --> 00:56:35.890
has the word adiabatic, which
means slow but also rapid.

00:56:41.140 --> 00:56:44.270
The word rapid means
we have to be rapid

00:56:44.270 --> 00:56:47.540
compared to relaxation
processes, which we do not

00:56:47.540 --> 00:56:50.860
discuss here in an
idealized environment.

00:56:50.860 --> 00:56:53.030
For instance, if you do
rapid adiabatic passage

00:56:53.030 --> 00:56:55.950
in the environment where
the atoms can collide,

00:56:55.950 --> 00:56:59.570
rapid means you have to do it
fast enough before you have

00:56:59.570 --> 00:57:04.400
decoherence in two collisions,
so slow compared to the Larmor

00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:08.370
frequency and rapid
compared to all the things

00:57:08.370 --> 00:57:12.900
I'm not mentioning
here-- rapid compared

00:57:12.900 --> 00:57:17.270
to decoherence and
relaxation processes.

00:57:31.910 --> 00:57:38.940
I will not set up differential
equation and solve them.

00:57:38.940 --> 00:57:47.120
I want to give you the intuitive
picture of what goes on,

00:57:47.120 --> 00:57:53.330
but then also
derive what is sort

00:57:53.330 --> 00:57:56.329
of the criterion
for adiabadicity,

00:57:56.329 --> 00:57:57.370
which we have to fulfill.

00:58:07.270 --> 00:58:08.630
So what are our ingredients?

00:58:08.630 --> 00:58:11.450
We have a magnetic moment, mu.

00:58:15.300 --> 00:58:18.310
We have a static field B naught.

00:58:20.920 --> 00:58:32.750
We have a drive field B1, which
rotates at a frequency omega.

00:58:32.750 --> 00:58:41.930
And we assume that
the rotating field

00:58:41.930 --> 00:58:45.310
is smaller than
the static field.

00:58:45.310 --> 00:58:48.220
It's not absolutely
necessary, but you

00:58:48.220 --> 00:58:50.060
apply a big static
field and then you

00:58:50.060 --> 00:58:51.210
have a repetitive drive.

00:58:51.210 --> 00:58:53.150
That's a standard situation.

00:58:53.150 --> 00:58:56.640
Or we always want to have
quantization axis, which

00:58:56.640 --> 00:58:58.840
is given with the
z-axis as defined

00:58:58.840 --> 00:59:01.600
by the static magnetic
field, but it's only

00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:03.820
defined by the
static magnetic field

00:59:03.820 --> 00:59:05.870
if the transverse
field is not much

00:59:05.870 --> 00:59:07.670
larger than the static
field, otherwise,

00:59:07.670 --> 00:59:09.978
we are talking about a
somewhat different problem.

00:59:12.820 --> 00:59:17.710
And let me just assume
to be specific we later

00:59:17.710 --> 00:59:20.100
discuss what happens
if it's not the case.

00:59:20.100 --> 00:59:25.020
We assume that we start with
a frequency omega, which

00:59:25.020 --> 00:59:27.457
is much, much smaller
than the Larmor frequency,

00:59:27.457 --> 00:59:29.040
much, much smaller
than the resonance.

00:59:36.710 --> 00:59:41.150
So what does that mean for
our effective magnetic field?

00:59:43.990 --> 00:59:46.470
Let me just sketch it for you.

00:59:46.470 --> 00:59:48.770
Remember our effective
magnetic field,

00:59:48.770 --> 00:59:50.860
we have a field B naught.

00:59:50.860 --> 00:59:54.660
We have a drive field B1,
which we assume is smaller.

00:59:54.660 --> 00:59:57.410
But then when we go
to the rotating frame,

00:59:57.410 --> 01:00:01.260
we have a fictitious field,
but if the frequency omega

01:00:01.260 --> 01:00:04.340
is below the Larmor frequency,
this fictitious field

01:00:04.340 --> 01:00:05.970
is very small.

01:00:05.970 --> 01:00:08.660
So therefore, we start
out in a situation

01:00:08.660 --> 01:00:11.850
where the effective field
is pretty much pointing

01:00:11.850 --> 01:00:13.001
along the z direction.

01:00:18.100 --> 01:00:23.750
So just to remind you,
so we have a situation

01:00:23.750 --> 01:00:33.450
where the effective field
is just at a tiny angle,

01:00:33.450 --> 01:00:42.994
and if we started out with our
magnetic moment aligned in z,

01:00:42.994 --> 01:00:46.290
and we assume B1 is really
perturbative, pretty

01:00:46.290 --> 01:00:50.170
much the magnetic moment
is very tightly coupled.

01:00:50.170 --> 01:00:54.040
It has a very small precession
angle, or if you want,

01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:56.570
if you take the magnetic
field B1 to be perturbative,

01:00:56.570 --> 01:00:59.440
you can say the
magnetic moment is

01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:03.390
aligned with the
effective field.

01:01:03.390 --> 01:01:06.260
That's the limit that the
cone angle of precession

01:01:06.260 --> 01:01:07.040
is very small.

01:01:17.860 --> 01:01:19.600
So let we write that down.

01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:23.720
This is what's omega
much, much smaller

01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:26.270
than the Larmor frequency.

01:01:39.210 --> 01:01:42.100
So now we want to
turn up the knob

01:01:42.100 --> 01:01:43.700
on the frequency of the drive.

01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:49.200
We want to rotate the drive
field B1 faster and faster.

01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:53.850
And the picture you should
have is-- I just wiped it away,

01:01:53.850 --> 01:01:58.590
but what that means is,
the effective field,

01:01:58.590 --> 01:02:02.380
the fictitious field is no
longer and longer component

01:02:02.380 --> 01:02:05.800
and on resonance, the
fictitious magnetic field

01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:08.420
will cancel B naught.

01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:10.370
So in other words,
at this point,

01:02:10.370 --> 01:02:13.710
when B naught is canceled,
the effective field

01:02:13.710 --> 01:02:19.100
has only the B1 component
in the x direction.

01:02:19.100 --> 01:02:25.110
So therefore, when be
go to delta equal 0,

01:02:25.110 --> 01:02:32.690
the effective field is only B1
and points in the x direction.

01:02:32.690 --> 01:02:36.510
So what we have done is
by changing the frequency,

01:02:36.510 --> 01:02:39.600
by ramping up the
frequency to resonance,

01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:42.430
we have tilted the
effective magnetic field

01:02:42.430 --> 01:02:47.070
from the z direction
into the x direction.

01:02:47.070 --> 01:02:49.230
And at any given
moment, I mean, we

01:02:49.230 --> 01:02:52.170
know what the exact solution
of the magnetic moment is.

01:02:52.170 --> 01:02:54.860
At any given moment,
the magnetic moment

01:02:54.860 --> 01:02:59.120
precesses around the
effective magnetic field.

01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:01.710
And if the precession
is very fast

01:03:01.710 --> 01:03:05.070
and the effective magnetic
field is slowly rotating,

01:03:05.070 --> 01:03:08.930
the magnetic moment
is just following.

01:03:08.930 --> 01:03:12.310
So therefore, at this point
when we are at resonance,

01:03:12.310 --> 01:03:17.560
we have tilted the magnetic
moment by 90 degrees.

01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:19.010
Just one second.

01:03:19.010 --> 01:03:24.100
And if we go with a
frequency much higher

01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:31.910
than the Larmor frequency, then
our fictitious magnetic field

01:03:31.910 --> 01:03:35.610
is much larger than B
naught and therefore,

01:03:35.610 --> 01:03:42.410
the effective magnetic
field points now

01:03:42.410 --> 01:03:43.470
in the minus z direction.

01:03:49.070 --> 01:03:52.750
So the idea is that as
long as this rotation

01:03:52.750 --> 01:03:57.200
of the effective field from
being plus z in the x direction

01:03:57.200 --> 01:04:01.850
and into minus z is slow
enough, the rapid precession is

01:04:01.850 --> 01:04:05.750
locking, is keeping the
magnetic moment aligned

01:04:05.750 --> 01:04:07.970
with the effective
magnetic field

01:04:07.970 --> 01:04:12.800
and we have just a
handle we invert.

01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:14.550
We move around the
magnetic moment.

01:04:17.180 --> 01:04:26.780
So in the adiabatic limit,
the spin precesses tightly,

01:04:26.780 --> 01:04:33.880
and by tightly I mean the angle
theta is small around B ef, B

01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:44.910
effective, and
follows the direction

01:04:44.910 --> 01:04:48.990
of the effective magnetic field.

01:04:48.990 --> 01:04:51.910
So we are rotating
an effective field.

01:04:51.910 --> 01:04:54.160
We are rotating the
magnetic moment,

01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:57.230
but we're not rotating
anything in the laboratory.

01:04:57.230 --> 01:04:59.025
The only thing we
are doing is, we

01:04:59.025 --> 01:05:01.610
are changing the frequency of
the rotating magnetic field.

01:05:11.530 --> 01:05:12.040
Questions?

01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:12.540
Jenny.

01:05:12.540 --> 01:05:13.666
AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah.

01:05:13.666 --> 01:05:15.230
I was thinking, can
you also do this

01:05:15.230 --> 01:05:17.198
by keeping the
frequency the same

01:05:17.198 --> 01:05:19.166
and just ramping
up the strength?

01:05:19.166 --> 01:05:23.594
Like say, put it at
the-- make the B1

01:05:23.594 --> 01:05:26.546
equal to the frequency
of that Larmor frequency

01:05:26.546 --> 01:05:29.498
and just start
from 0 and ramp up?

01:05:29.498 --> 01:05:30.430
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:05:30.430 --> 01:05:34.620
I mean, the essence here is that
the effective magnetic field

01:05:34.620 --> 01:05:37.640
is [INAUDIBLE] resonance,
and what you are suggesting

01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:40.120
is if the frequency is
constant, that would

01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:43.090
mean the fictitious
magnetic field is constant.

01:05:43.090 --> 01:05:46.060
But if you were given a
fictitious magnetic field

01:05:46.060 --> 01:05:49.830
and we a huge field B naught,
the effective magnetic field

01:05:49.830 --> 01:05:51.800
points out, points up.

01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:54.800
But if we now make this
static field B naught smaller

01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:57.110
and smaller, both
through resonance

01:05:57.110 --> 01:05:59.710
and make it even
smaller, we have also

01:05:59.710 --> 01:06:02.680
done an inversion of the
effective magnetic field.

01:06:02.680 --> 01:06:05.220
The result is the same.

01:06:05.220 --> 01:06:07.180
Actually, sometimes
in the laboratory,

01:06:07.180 --> 01:06:09.610
if you have a synthesizer
which is not easily

01:06:09.610 --> 01:06:12.530
computer controlled,
we do an analog sweep

01:06:12.530 --> 01:06:14.980
of the magnetic
field, so we actually

01:06:14.980 --> 01:06:18.910
change the Larmor frequency
of the atom instead

01:06:18.910 --> 01:06:20.580
of changing the drive frequency.

01:06:20.580 --> 01:06:22.290
What really matters
in the whole business

01:06:22.290 --> 01:06:24.480
is the relative frequency
between the two.

01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:29.400
AUDIENCE: Is it necessarily
true that the spin resistance

01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:31.860
is tightly around
the effective fields?

01:06:31.860 --> 01:06:35.796
Isn't it at resonance the radius
of the circle in precession

01:06:35.796 --> 01:06:38.748
is equal to mu?

01:06:38.748 --> 01:06:42.438
Is it my [INAUDIBLE]
before we found

01:06:42.438 --> 01:06:44.160
the radius which
was mu sine theta.

01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:49.160
Then sine theta cosine Omega R--

01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:49.895
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:06:49.895 --> 01:06:50.978
AUDIENCE: --divided into--

01:06:50.978 --> 01:06:52.776
PROFESSOR: But the
way is we start--

01:06:52.776 --> 01:06:54.150
the way we've
started it up here.

01:06:54.150 --> 01:06:59.820
Now if we are far
away from resonance,

01:06:59.820 --> 01:07:04.390
the angle theta is
infinitesimally small.

01:07:04.390 --> 01:07:05.500
Something confuses you.

01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:06.125
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:07:06.125 --> 01:07:09.702
I mean, it's just [INAUDIBLE].

01:07:09.702 --> 01:07:11.160
PROFESSOR: See,
what we have solved

01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:14.730
before, we have done
something else before.

01:07:14.730 --> 01:07:16.550
What we have
discussed before is,

01:07:16.550 --> 01:07:19.140
that we have a spin
which is aligned

01:07:19.140 --> 01:07:23.520
and then we looked at the-- you
can say the transient solution,

01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:27.120
we switched suddenly
on the rotating field.

01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:29.090
So that may sort
of described that.

01:07:29.090 --> 01:07:31.410
We have a magnetic field,
which is in the z direction.

01:07:31.410 --> 01:07:32.330
Obviously we don't.

01:07:32.330 --> 01:07:34.370
Our spin is aligned
in the z direction.

01:07:34.370 --> 01:07:38.290
And if you then suddenly
switch on a rotating field,

01:07:38.290 --> 01:07:40.290
that could mean
you have suddenly

01:07:40.290 --> 01:07:42.800
created an effective
field, which is tilted.

01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:46.020
So then by the sudden
switch on of your drive,

01:07:46.020 --> 01:07:49.680
you have an angle theta and
the magnetic moment precesses

01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:51.990
with the precession angle theta.

01:07:51.990 --> 01:07:53.900
But what we are
here doing is, we

01:07:53.900 --> 01:07:59.060
are ever so slightly
changing the angle theta

01:07:59.060 --> 01:08:01.169
and then the spin stays aligned.

01:08:01.169 --> 01:08:02.085
That's the difference.

01:08:08.740 --> 01:08:18.750
So before I give
you another example

01:08:18.750 --> 01:08:25.704
and discuss the limit
of adiabadicity,

01:08:25.704 --> 01:08:27.120
let's just have a
quicker question

01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:29.620
to make sure that
everybody follows.

01:08:29.620 --> 01:08:37.479
So OK, what I think we
have at least understood

01:08:37.479 --> 01:08:40.410
in the adiabatic
limit is, that when

01:08:40.410 --> 01:08:49.710
we start with a magnetic
moment, which is aligned,

01:08:49.710 --> 01:08:56.960
and now we do a sweep, we start
with a small rotating frequency

01:08:56.960 --> 01:08:58.819
and we make it large.

01:08:58.819 --> 01:09:03.590
We sweep from low to high
frequency through resonance,

01:09:03.590 --> 01:09:10.180
then we can invert
the magnetic moment.

01:09:10.180 --> 01:09:20.420
My question for you
now is, what happens

01:09:20.420 --> 01:09:25.330
when we start with
a spin but we switch

01:09:25.330 --> 01:09:29.930
on a drive, which
is a buff resonance

01:09:29.930 --> 01:09:32.960
and we sweep it with
small frequencies?

01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:37.020
What will now happen when
we do the opposite sweep?

01:09:37.020 --> 01:09:44.619
Will the spin just stay,
will it be flipped,

01:09:44.619 --> 01:09:47.659
or will it sort of get
diffused or get disoriented?

01:09:50.250 --> 01:09:55.250
So this is answer A, this is
answer B, and this is answer C.

01:09:55.250 --> 01:09:57.020
So what happens?

01:09:57.020 --> 01:09:59.310
I have assumed in
already discussion

01:09:59.310 --> 01:10:02.890
before that we start with
a very low frequency where

01:10:02.890 --> 01:10:05.920
the fictitious magnetic
field is negligible.

01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:08.070
And then we change
the frequency,

01:10:08.070 --> 01:10:09.580
we sweep the frequency.

01:10:09.580 --> 01:10:12.860
It cause the Larmor frequency
to very high frequency.

01:10:12.860 --> 01:10:15.460
My question now is,
what happens when

01:10:15.460 --> 01:10:18.740
we reverse the
frequency of the sweep?

01:10:37.445 --> 01:10:37.945
OK.

01:10:40.870 --> 01:10:43.440
There is some distribution.

01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:47.570
The correct answer is
indeed B, we flip the spin.

01:10:47.570 --> 01:10:51.510
What happens is the following.

01:10:51.510 --> 01:10:55.050
The spin is in the z direction,
but at high frequency,

01:10:55.050 --> 01:10:57.850
the fictitious magnetic
field is very large.

01:10:57.850 --> 01:11:00.440
So therefore, the
effective magnetic field

01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:03.500
is now a large
effective magnetic field

01:11:03.500 --> 01:11:06.540
pointing in the
minus z direction.

01:11:06.540 --> 01:11:10.390
So now we have a situation
where the spin tightly precesses

01:11:10.390 --> 01:11:12.980
around the magnetic
effective magnetic field

01:11:12.980 --> 01:11:17.400
at an angle of 180 degrees,
not 0 degrees, but 180 degrees.

01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:23.410
And now, when we
change the detuning,

01:11:23.410 --> 01:11:26.250
the effective
magnetic field tilts,

01:11:26.250 --> 01:11:29.580
but the spin keeps on
precessing at 180 degrees

01:11:29.580 --> 01:11:33.070
and eventually when we
sweep through the resonance,

01:11:33.070 --> 01:11:36.890
the effective magnetic field at
low frequency of the rotating

01:11:36.890 --> 01:11:39.710
field becomes the real
magnetic field is now

01:11:39.710 --> 01:11:43.020
pointing in the z
direction and the spin

01:11:43.020 --> 01:11:46.150
has followed the
180 degree rotation.

01:11:46.150 --> 01:11:48.570
So in other words,
it does not matter

01:11:48.570 --> 01:11:51.930
whether you go from low to high
or from high to low frequency.

01:11:51.930 --> 01:11:55.230
Whenever you go through the
resonance, you flip the spin.

01:12:02.100 --> 01:12:05.150
Let's close that Let's see.

01:12:05.150 --> 01:12:05.916
It is that.

01:12:14.970 --> 01:12:22.250
So the more
generalized answer is

01:12:22.250 --> 01:12:38.130
that the rapid adiabatic passage
always swaps the spin state

01:12:38.130 --> 01:12:39.890
no matter which way you sweep.

01:12:39.890 --> 01:12:43.240
When you start in spin up,
you wind up in spin down.

01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:46.050
When you start in
spin down, you wind up

01:12:46.050 --> 01:12:48.320
in spin up because
what you're doing

01:12:48.320 --> 01:12:53.280
is you're inverting
the direction

01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:55.950
of the effective magnetic field
and the spin just follows.

01:12:58.820 --> 01:13:01.330
So therefore it goes both ways.

01:13:01.330 --> 01:13:04.030
It applies to-- you can
say to the ground state

01:13:04.030 --> 01:13:07.300
with the lowest energy state,
it applies to the highest energy

01:13:07.300 --> 01:13:11.640
state, and as such,
it is actually

01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:17.320
a swap operation like
the pi over 2 pulse.

01:13:17.320 --> 01:13:20.950
When you have a pi over
2 pulse, you have a spin

01:13:20.950 --> 01:13:24.410
and you just pulse on a
rotating magnetic field, which

01:13:24.410 --> 01:13:28.260
in the rotating flame
means you have an x field.

01:13:28.260 --> 01:13:32.170
When the spin was up at the
Rabi frequency, rotates down.

01:13:32.170 --> 01:13:36.300
When the spin was down at the
Rabi frequency, it rotates up.

01:13:36.300 --> 01:13:40.410
And quantum mechanically it just
means you take the population

01:13:40.410 --> 01:13:44.910
in two states and your
unitary time evolution

01:13:44.910 --> 01:13:45.950
is a swap operation.

01:13:48.540 --> 01:13:51.670
And the classical counterpart
is what we just discussed,

01:13:51.670 --> 01:13:54.670
the rapid adiabatic passage.

01:13:54.670 --> 01:13:58.470
However, there is one big
experimental advantage

01:13:58.470 --> 01:14:03.320
of doing rapid adiabatic
passage over pi over 2 pulse.

01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:08.120
And I think many of you
use rapid adiabatic passage

01:14:08.120 --> 01:14:09.250
in the lab.

01:14:09.250 --> 01:14:11.760
Remember, if you give
yourself the drop,

01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:17.730
you want to transfer the
magnetic moment form spin up

01:14:17.730 --> 01:14:19.870
to spin down.

01:14:19.870 --> 01:14:22.502
If you want to do it
with the pi pulse--

01:14:22.502 --> 01:14:25.910
if you want to do it with
the-- I said pi over 2 pulse,

01:14:25.910 --> 01:14:27.057
I meant pi pulse.

01:14:33.740 --> 01:14:36.860
The only way how
with a pulse you

01:14:36.860 --> 01:14:42.460
can rotate the magnetic
moment by 180 degrees, if you

01:14:42.460 --> 01:14:46.650
are exactly on resonance, where
the fictitious field cancels

01:14:46.650 --> 01:14:50.900
the static field and what you
have is in the rotating frame

01:14:50.900 --> 01:14:52.920
is only a field in x.

01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:55.940
And then you can rotate
around the x-axis.

01:14:55.940 --> 01:15:01.100
But if for some reason you're
not exactly on resonance, then

01:15:01.100 --> 01:15:04.090
the fictitious field does
not cancel the static field,

01:15:04.090 --> 01:15:07.370
and your effective magnetic
field is at an angle.

01:15:07.370 --> 01:15:10.120
And if you rotate an
effective magnetic field,

01:15:10.120 --> 01:15:12.990
which is not in the
x-axis but at an angle,

01:15:12.990 --> 01:15:16.790
you cannot do a full inversion
of the magnetic moment.

01:15:16.790 --> 01:15:20.540
So in other words, if you want
to use a pi pulse to flip over

01:15:20.540 --> 01:15:24.300
a spin, you have to pulse
on your drive exactly

01:15:24.300 --> 01:15:25.970
on resonance.

01:15:25.970 --> 01:15:29.690
And if you have MBN magnetic
fields which drift by a few

01:15:29.690 --> 01:15:32.250
milligals and you're not
sure where the resonance is,

01:15:32.250 --> 01:15:35.330
you cannot do a
perfect pi pulse.

01:15:35.330 --> 01:15:40.160
But with the sweep, you just
have to sweep from point A

01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:43.340
to point B, and if you know
you cross the resonance,

01:15:43.340 --> 01:15:47.750
you have a perfect inversion
of the magnetic moment, which

01:15:47.750 --> 01:15:49.726
is robust against
frequency drifts.

01:15:59.446 --> 01:16:04.360
Of course, you have
to do a longer sweep.

01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:06.610
The pi pulse is the
shortest possible wave.

01:16:06.610 --> 01:16:09.396
If you heat the cloud on
resonance, you first sweep,

01:16:09.396 --> 01:16:10.770
nothing happens,
nothing happens,

01:16:10.770 --> 01:16:13.394
and you go through resonance and
just view further and further,

01:16:13.394 --> 01:16:14.840
you waste some of your time.

01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:18.230
So you pay a price for it,
but often we want precision

01:16:18.230 --> 01:16:20.470
and we have the time
to do it and then

01:16:20.470 --> 01:16:22.970
the job is done by
rapid adiabatic passage.

01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:30.050
Let me just mention one
more thing and then I stop.

01:16:33.570 --> 01:16:42.004
I have discussed the
physics of keeping--

01:16:42.004 --> 01:16:43.420
with rapid adiabatic
passage, I've

01:16:43.420 --> 01:16:48.140
discussed with you the physics
that rapid precession keeps

01:16:48.140 --> 01:16:52.750
a magnetic moment aligned with
an effective magnetic field.

01:16:52.750 --> 01:16:57.410
Let me now discuss
the same phenomenon

01:16:57.410 --> 01:16:58.910
but in a very
different environment.

01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:11.170
And this is a similar process
happen in a magnetic trap.

01:17:11.170 --> 01:17:19.110
In a magnetic trap, we
don't have any drive

01:17:19.110 --> 01:17:23.730
or we have a
time-dependent field.

01:17:23.730 --> 01:17:27.450
But what happens is, we
have a magnetic field,

01:17:27.450 --> 01:17:30.950
but the atoms move
through the atom trap.

01:17:30.950 --> 01:17:35.720
So the atom sees a
changing magnetic field.

01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:39.350
And in many of our
experiments here at MIT,

01:17:39.350 --> 01:17:43.290
we use a quadrupolar field.

01:17:43.290 --> 01:17:47.210
We've discussed some of
these aspects in 8.422,

01:17:47.210 --> 01:17:50.780
so a quadrupolar
field, the field

01:17:50.780 --> 01:17:56.080
has to be homogeneous in order
to provide trapping forces,

01:17:56.080 --> 01:18:00.320
so we often use quadrupolar
fields, a lot of advantages.

01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:03.240
That's how we build the
tightest magnetic traps.

01:18:03.240 --> 01:18:07.000
But what happens now
is, if an atom moves

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:12.520
along this projector, it
moves up in the laboratory,

01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:16.830
here t let's say the
atom is in spin up.

01:18:16.830 --> 01:18:18.710
Here it's now a aligned.

01:18:21.670 --> 01:18:24.660
The magnetic field is
opposite to the spin

01:18:24.660 --> 01:18:28.390
and now it moves up, and now
the magnetic field up here

01:18:28.390 --> 01:18:30.090
is pointing up.

01:18:30.090 --> 01:18:34.100
The physics I explain to you
rapid adiabatic passage means

01:18:34.100 --> 01:18:36.400
that the rapid
precession off this spin

01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:40.730
means that as the atom
moves, the spin stays

01:18:40.730 --> 01:18:43.050
aligned with the magnetic field.

01:18:43.050 --> 01:18:46.700
So you find the
same physics here

01:18:46.700 --> 01:18:49.615
in a different environment, but
the mathematical description

01:18:49.615 --> 01:18:50.894
is the same.

01:18:53.786 --> 01:18:57.380
Of course, and that's my
last comment for today,

01:18:57.380 --> 01:18:59.790
if you have a spheric
quadrupole trap

01:18:59.790 --> 01:19:04.150
and you go right
through the origin,

01:19:04.150 --> 01:19:06.970
you're out of luck
because here, the atom

01:19:06.970 --> 01:19:09.040
sees the magnetic field is down.

01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:10.506
It gets smaller,
the magnetic field

01:19:10.506 --> 01:19:11.630
gets smaller, gets smaller.

01:19:11.630 --> 01:19:13.270
The magnet field gets zero.

01:19:13.270 --> 01:19:16.600
Oopsy, the magnetic field
points in the other direction.

01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:18.050
And there was no warning.

01:19:18.050 --> 01:19:22.600
The magnetic field has jumped
from 0 degree to 180 degree.

01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:27.260
There was never, ever any
transverse field around which

01:19:27.260 --> 01:19:30.360
the atom could precess and
change its orientation.

01:19:30.360 --> 01:19:33.580
So therefore, when an atom is
aligned with a magnetic field

01:19:33.580 --> 01:19:36.590
moves through the origin,
oopsy, it's anti aligned.

01:19:36.590 --> 01:19:40.280
It has lost its orientation with
respect to the magnetic field,

01:19:40.280 --> 01:19:43.610
and this is the breakdown
of rapid adiabatic passage

01:19:43.610 --> 01:19:45.230
because there's no adiabadicity.

01:19:45.230 --> 01:19:47.770
It is not an adiabatic
change of the direction

01:19:47.770 --> 01:19:50.210
of the magnetic field,
it's a sudden field.

01:19:50.210 --> 01:19:52.310
And the consequences are bad.

01:19:52.310 --> 01:19:54.580
You lose your atoms
from the magnetic trap.

01:19:54.580 --> 01:19:56.207
It's called Majorana losses.

01:19:56.207 --> 01:19:58.040
A lot of people know
what I'm talking about,

01:19:58.040 --> 01:20:01.200
but I'm not explaining
it in detail.

01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:02.020
Time is over.

01:20:02.020 --> 01:20:07.760
Any question about
what I've discussed?

01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:08.639
Yes.

01:20:08.639 --> 01:20:09.637
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:20:20.116 --> 01:20:22.262
PROFESSOR: You said
the weights of the--

01:20:22.262 --> 01:20:23.750
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so [INAUDIBLE].

01:20:31.686 --> 01:20:34.690
PROFESSOR: I would say-- the
question is about the frequency

01:20:34.690 --> 01:20:37.950
weights and if you switch
on the frequency drive,

01:20:37.950 --> 01:20:39.610
it's not a delta function.

01:20:39.610 --> 01:20:41.270
If we are far away
from resonance,

01:20:41.270 --> 01:20:43.570
it doesn't really matter.

01:20:43.570 --> 01:20:47.160
That is, of course, a criterion
that the effective weights

01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:54.690
of the frequency should not
be comparable to the detuning.

01:20:54.690 --> 01:20:57.259
So then you switch it on,
but you're so far away

01:20:57.259 --> 01:20:58.800
from resonance that
it doesn't matter

01:20:58.800 --> 01:21:01.410
if you have a small weights,
the effective detuning is still

01:21:01.410 --> 01:21:02.120
large.

01:21:02.120 --> 01:21:03.980
You scan for resonance.

01:21:03.980 --> 01:21:06.210
But these are sort of
the boundary condition.

01:21:06.210 --> 01:21:08.860
The exact solution in
the Landau-Zener problem,

01:21:08.860 --> 01:21:11.830
for instance, assumes you
go from minus infinity

01:21:11.830 --> 01:21:13.990
to plus infinity
in the detuning.

01:21:13.990 --> 01:21:15.250
Nobody does that.

01:21:15.250 --> 01:21:20.220
So we're discussing sort of
sweep finite duration effects,

01:21:20.220 --> 01:21:26.550
but usually we are pretty close
to the idealized assumption.

01:21:26.550 --> 01:21:29.100
OK, enjoy the Monday holiday.

01:21:29.100 --> 01:21:32.410
We meet on Tuesday,
and Tuesday is

01:21:32.410 --> 01:21:35.830
in building 37 in our
standard classroom.
