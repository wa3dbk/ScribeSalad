00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.190
PROFESSOR: So over
the last lecture,

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:28.070
we have talked about
coherence within an atom,

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.880
coherence between two levels,
coherence between three levels.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.020
And today, in the
last class, we want

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:40.270
to talk about coherence
between atoms.

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.380
So this is now, I think,
for the first time

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.550
in this course that we really
have more than one atom.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.550
Well, maybe we discussed
some collision or broadening,

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.320
or we discussed [INAUDIBLE]
interaction between two atoms.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.530
But usually, atomic physics
is one atom at a time.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.269
But now we want to understand
one important phenomenon which

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:07.810
happens when we have many atoms.

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.700
And the phenomenon is
called superradiance.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.380
So I left something
good for the end.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.800
And superradiance has
in common the word

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.800
super with superconductivity
and superfluidity.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.240
And it really represents
that the atom, many atoms

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.600
act together.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.300
And the word super
also means coherence

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:34.120
among atoms-- superfluidity
and superconductivity

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.550
have macroscopic wave function
where all the atoms, the meta

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.830
waves are coherent.

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.770
The phenomenon of
superradiance, as we will see,

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.660
has not so much to do
with coherent atoms.

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.740
It has more to do
with coherent photons.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.730
So it's more-- some people
regard superradiance as a laser

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:55.850
without mirrors.

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.250
But you'll see where
the story leads us to.

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:05.620
So just to set the
stage-- for many atoms,

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:11.770
we should first talk
about single atoms.

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.280
And all that is described
in this landmark paper

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.580
by [INAUDIBLE] in 1954, which
is posted on our website.

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.710
So if you have a single atom
prepared in the excited state,

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.060
it decays to the
ground state, and we

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.170
want to characterize the
system by emission rate

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.850
as a function of time.

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:38.450
So the emission rate initially
is gamma, the natural language

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:39.887
of the excited state.

00:02:39.887 --> 00:02:41.470
And then, of course,
the emission rate

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.330
decays because we don't
have any atoms left.

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.000
Similarly, the probability
to be in the ground state

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.410
is zero initially, and then
with an exponential approach,

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.820
it eventually goes to
unity after a while,

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.897
after we have only atoms
in the gamma state.

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.050
So this is rather
straightforward.

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.840
But now we want to
bring in a second atom.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.830
And I'm asking,
what happens when

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.660
we have not the one
atom, but two atoms?

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:21.830
One is in the ground state.

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:23.390
One is excited.

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.965
So pretty much what we have
added to the original situation

00:03:25.965 --> 00:03:29.320
with one excited atom
was we've brought in one

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:35.870
ground state atom, which naively
you would think does nothing.

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.450
But that's not the case.

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:46.910
What happens is-- and I
assume just for review--

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:48.930
we will drop the
assumption later,

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.130
but we assume for now
that all the atoms

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.550
are within one
optical wavelength.

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.160
What we then realize
is for two atoms--

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.530
and I will show you that
in its full beauty--

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.810
that the initial rate of light
which comes out of the system

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:03.660
is the same.

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.660
So the extra ground
state atom does not

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:17.950
change the initial emission
rate, but it goes down faster.

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:23.010
And if we ask what is the
probability that the atom is

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:27.520
in the ground state, we find
that it's only one half.

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.120
So in other words, normalized
[INAUDIBLE] system,

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.520
we have a ground and excited
state atom, and what comes out

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.500
is only half a photon.

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.250
Half of the atoms do not decay.

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:45.730
So it's not the same
rate and the same decay.

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:47.544
Something profoundly
has happened.

00:04:47.544 --> 00:04:49.210
And this is what you
want to understand.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:53.820
So let me give you
the correct answer.

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.720
The rate of emission
is a function

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.490
of time for this situation.

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:07.780
We start out with gamma, but
then the emission decays, not

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.030
with gamma but with 2 gamma.

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:19.470
And the probability that both
atoms are in the ground state--

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:23.560
or that the second atom, so to
speak, is in the ground state--

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.910
will only asymptotically
go to 1/2.

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:31.820
And it does so
exponentially-- but again,

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:37.050
with the time constant,
which is two times faster

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.150
than for the single-atom system.

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:57.970
So we have the same initial
emission rate, but only

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:02.260
probability of 1/2
to emit at all.

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:15.920
So in order to
understand it, we have

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:22.350
to look at an atom in the
excited state and atom

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:23.730
in the ground state.

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:26.680
And we want to write
down the wave function

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.910
as a superposition of a
symmetrized and antisymmetrized

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:30.780
wave function.

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:47.610
I should tell you, I'm going
very slowly for two atoms.

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:51.330
And then once I've introduced
the concept for two atoms,

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:55.090
with a few pen strokes, we can
immediately discuss in atoms.

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:57.470
So all the phsyics,
all the understanding

00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:59.601
what goes on in
superradiance is already

00:06:59.601 --> 00:07:00.600
displayed for two atoms.

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:04.930
So we want to have
a superposition

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:09.490
of symmetric and
antisymmetric wave function.

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:12.150
The symmetric one is a
normalized wave function

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:14.190
which is ge plus eg.

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:25.160
And we call that the
superradiant wave function,

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:28.050
for reasons which will
become clear in a moment.

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:30.260
And if you have a
minus sign here,

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:35.980
the antisymmetric
combination, we

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:40.420
call this subradiant
wave function.

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:44.620
Now, what happens is,
we have to consider--

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:46.662
so we have symmetrized
the wave function.

00:07:46.662 --> 00:07:48.120
Well, I didn't
really tell you why,

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:50.450
but it's always
good to symmetrize.

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:52.740
Symmetry is, if you can
use it, something good.

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:58.740
And the reason why I
symmetrized it is because I want

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:00.240
look at the interaction
Hamiltonian.

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:08.060
And if I look at the interaction
Hamiltonian-- the one

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:11.005
we have seen many, many
times but now for two atoms--

00:08:11.005 --> 00:08:14.780
we will immediately realize that
this interaction Hamiltonian is

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:16.520
symmetric.

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:19.686
So therefore, if the
Hamiltonian is symmetric,

00:08:19.686 --> 00:08:21.060
it's a really good
starting point

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:23.615
to have the wave function
for the atoms expanded

00:08:23.615 --> 00:08:25.870
in a symmetric basis.

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:30.220
And since I want to emphasize
that the whole story I'm

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:32.870
telling you today
has nothing to do

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:41.350
with the kind of
second quantization--

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:42.730
it is about
spontaneous emission,

00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:44.550
but it's not
involving any subtlety

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:47.520
of spontaneous
emission and field

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:54.140
quantization-- I want to
write down the interaction

00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:58.070
Hamiltonian both in a classical
and a quantum mechanical way.

00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:03.540
In the classical way, we
have the dipole moment d1.

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:06.310
We have the dipole moment d2.

00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:12.660
And the atoms talk to the
electric field at position RNT.

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:20.490
And now you realize where
some of the assumptions

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:23.820
are important, since the
atoms are localized to

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:25.730
within a wavelength,
they rarely talk

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:26.890
to the same electric field.

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:29.650
There are no phase factors.

00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:33.210
In about 55 minutes or so,
we introduce phase factors

00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:34.450
for extended samples.

00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:36.330
But for now, we don't.

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:39.340
And therefore, what
the atoms couple with

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:41.350
is with a dipole
moment, which is

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:42.985
a sum of the two dipole moments.

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:56.160
So this is classical
or semi-classical.

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.470
So what enters in
the Hamiltonian

00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:05.750
is only the sum of the
operators for the two atoms.

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:09.017
And the same happens
in the QED Hamiltonian.

00:10:09.017 --> 00:10:11.100
And actually, I will get
a little bit more mileage

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:16.050
out of the QED Hamiltonian,
as you will see in a moment.

00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:24.490
Because with the QED Hamiltonian
we describe the atomic system--

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:27.260
so at first atom
one-- with the raising

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:30.500
and lowering operator
with the atoms interacting

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:33.710
with a and a [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:38.370
And then I have to add the term
where the index one and two are

00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:38.870
exchanged.

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:44.780
So we are introducing
here-- that's

00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:49.020
convenient for two-level atom--
the spin notation sigma plus

00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:52.820
and sigma minus are the
raising and lowering operator

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:56.150
which flip the atom from the
ground to the excited state

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:58.520
and vice versa.

00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:01.170
But the important
part now is-- and this

00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:06.370
is where, actually, everything
comes from in superradiance--

00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:12.790
that the coupling involves
not the individual spins,

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:16.940
little sigma plus,
sigma 1 and sigma 2--

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:27.650
it only involves the
sum of the individuals.

00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:33.280
i equals 122, and later
we extend the sum to n.

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:41.630
So therefore, what matters
for the interaction

00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:46.550
of the atoms with the
electromagnetic field

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:51.210
is the sum of all the
atomic spin operators.

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:56.240
And the sum is, of course,
symmetric against exchange.

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:59.950
So therefore, when
we are asking what

00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:06.160
is the coupling of the
state which I called

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:10.810
the superradiant state, the
one where we had symmetrized eg

00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:16.770
plus ge, or we ask,
what is the coupling

00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:25.830
of the subradiant state
to-- well, the state where

00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:28.960
both atoms are in
the ground state.

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:31.610
Well, now we can use symmetry.

00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:33.370
The left-hand side is symmetric.

00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:35.170
The operator is symmetric.

00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:37.980
And now only the symmetric
state will couple.

00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:40.690
The antisymmetric
state will not couple.

00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:46.830
So therefore, the subradiant
state, eg minus ge,

00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:47.986
cannot decay.

00:12:47.986 --> 00:12:49.360
That's why we call
it subradiant.

00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:55.275
I think a better word
would be non-radiant,

00:12:55.275 --> 00:12:58.760
but non is definitely
subradiant.

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:02.800
And for the matrix
element eg and ge,

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:06.670
we find that we have actually
an enhancement of the coupling

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:08.090
by a factor of square root 2.

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:21.480
So now we pretty much
know what we have to do.

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:33.000
You want to use the symmetry
of-- let's assume we consider

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.020
ground and excited state
of each atom as spin 1/2.

00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:41.510
But now we want to look at the
total spin, the total pseudo

00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:43.730
angular momentum
of the two atoms,

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:46.120
and later we extend
it to n atoms.

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:48.700
So we want to use now the
power of the angular momentum

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:50.950
description.

00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:52.620
And that goes like follows.

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:55.980
We have four states
of two atoms.

00:13:55.980 --> 00:14:05.930
And this is gg, ge, eg, and ee.

00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:10.410
And if I denote with
ground state spin

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:19.920
down, excited state spin
up, I'm talking about 2

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:23.960
spin 1/2 states.

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:38.580
And 2 spin 1/2 states
can couple to s

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:43.100
equals 1, total s equals 1,
and total spin s equals 0.

00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:51.820
And that's what I've done here.

00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:56.940
I've arranged the states ee, the
symmetric superradiant state,

00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:59.775
the ground state, and
the subradiant state.

00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:04.700
A variation energy
level diagram--

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:07.660
here we have 0
excitation energy,

00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:09.470
here we have 1
excitation energy,

00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:12.520
and here we have two excitations
energies of the atom.

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:16.080
But I've also labeled
now the spin labels

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:18.580
for the combined system.

00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:23.790
Those symmetrized states
correspond to a spin equals 1.

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:27.350
It's a triplet letter with
three different magnetic quantum

00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:28.590
numbers.

00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:31.420
m equals plus 1 means
everything is highly excited.

00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:35.550
m equals minus 1 means we are
in the total ground state.

00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:39.340
And here we have
the simulate state,

00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:45.060
which is the antisymmetric
state or the subradiant state.

00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:54.660
And our interaction Hamiltonian
is the total spin plus minus.

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:57.540
It is the raising and
the lowering operator.

00:15:57.540 --> 00:15:59.680
And you know that the
raising and lowering

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:03.910
operator for the spin is
only making transitions

00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:06.910
within a manifold of total s.

00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:10.940
It just changes the end
quantum number by plus minus 1.

00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:14.750
So the Hamiltonian cannot do
anything to the simulate state,

00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:17.260
because there is no other
simulate state to couple.

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:21.100
But within the triplet
manifold, the sigma plus sigma

00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:24.140
minus operator is
creating transitions

00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:26.850
between the
different end states.

00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:30.030
And the coupling constant,
which for an individual atom

00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:36.670
was little g is now factor
of square root 2 enhanced.

00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:39.230
And we will see in a few
minutes, that for n atoms,

00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:41.220
it's square root n enhanced.

00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:45.340
And if any speak, that's where
the word super in superradiance

00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:45.860
comes from.

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:54.920
Yeah, actually let
me just quickly add

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:58.410
the diagram for the single atom.

00:16:58.410 --> 00:17:03.010
The single atom has only an
excited state, a ground state.

00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:06.480
It corresponds to s equals 1/2.

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:11.369
And we have magnetic
quantum numbers off plus 1/2

00:17:11.369 --> 00:17:13.990
and minus 1/2.

00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:18.980
And the coupling due to
the light atom interaction

00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:20.579
goes with the
coupling constant g.

00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:37.010
So the key message
we have learned here

00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:44.810
is that when we
have several atoms

00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:47.680
within an optical
wavelength, we should

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:50.590
use for their
description symmetrized

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:52.270
and antisymmetrized states.

00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:56.840
Or when we generalize
to more than two atoms,

00:17:56.840 --> 00:18:00.930
we should just add the
total angular momenta

00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:04.390
by treating each atom
as pseudo spin 1/2.

00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:07.040
And it is this
angular classification

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:11.410
which tells us how the
radiation proceeds.

00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:20.110
Because the coupling to
the electromagnetic field

00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:24.820
is only involving the
lowering and raising

00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:31.770
operators for the total spin.

00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:38.620
And this only acts
on a manifold where

00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:45.820
the total spin s is conserved.

00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:49.450
And what we get is transitions
with delta in plus minus 1.

00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:58.980
So the question, have those
effects been observed?

00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:00.210
Yes, they have, actually.

00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:02.540
And they're important
for a lot of research.

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:07.460
But just for two atoms,
the simplest observation

00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:09.320
is when you take
two atoms-- let's

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:12.120
say two sodium atoms--
bring them very close,

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:14.590
and you form a
sodium 2 molecule.

00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:21.160
And to some extent, in four
states where the molecule are

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:23.220
binding is not
completely changing

00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:27.850
the electronic structure, we
can regard the sodium 2 molecule

00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:30.400
as consisting of
two sodium atoms.

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:33.350
And indeed, if you do
spectroscopy of the sodium 2

00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:36.390
molecule, you find
some molecular states

00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:40.080
which are very long lived, like
the subradiant states, which

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:42.030
do not radiate at
all, but then you

00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:45.970
find states which have a
spontaneous emission rate which

00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:50.070
is about two times faster than
the spontaneous emission rate.

00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:52.590
So you find that
you can understand

00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:55.710
some radiative
properties of molecules

00:19:55.710 --> 00:20:00.060
by assuming that they
are related to the sub

00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:02.459
and superradiant
state of the two atoms

00:20:02.459 --> 00:20:03.500
which form this molecule.

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:14.810
So an example here
is sodium 2 molecule.

00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:31.150
A state where the gamma molecule
is approximately 2 times gamma

00:20:31.150 --> 00:20:34.570
sodium, or other states
where it's very small.

00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:38.720
OK.

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:44.790
Now we understand the basic four
of superradiance in two atoms.

00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:52.485
And therefore, we can now
generalize it to end particles.

00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:06.910
But before I use the
spin algebra to describe

00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:13.720
end particles, I want to glean
some intuition where we just

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:16.070
consider-- and
this takes us back

00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:19.020
to the beginning of the
course-- where we consider

00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:22.000
end spins in a magnetic field.

00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:34.085
And I really invite you to think
now completely classically.

00:21:36.545 --> 00:21:38.670
We'll describe it quantum
mechanically in a moment.

00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:41.280
But I've often said
in this course,

00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:43.950
if in doubt, if you have
a classical description

00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:47.830
and a quantum mechanical
and they seem to contradict,

00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:50.600
usually there is more truth
in the classical description.

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:52.630
It's so much easier
to fool yourself

00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:55.040
with the formalism
of quantum mechanics.

00:21:55.040 --> 00:22:02.310
So let's take end spins
in a magnetic field

00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:04.300
and ask what happens.

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:07.260
So we have end spins.

00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:08.670
So these are now real spins.

00:22:08.670 --> 00:22:10.180
They have a real
magnetic moment.

00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:12.580
These are tiny
little bar magnets.

00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:17.620
And we do pi over 2 pulse.

00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:23.490
And after we've done
a pi over 2 products,

00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:26.960
the spins are aligned like this.

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:30.130
Let's assume we had
our magnetic field.

00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:34.020
And now what happens
is these spins

00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:44.030
will precess at the
line of frequency.

00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:52.200
So now you have your end spins.

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:53.820
They precess together.

00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:58.120
And if you have a magnetic
moment which oscillates,

00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:01.430
the classical equation
of electromagnetism

00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:06.270
tells you that you have now
a system which radiates.

00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:18.970
But compared to a single
atom, the dipole moment

00:23:18.970 --> 00:23:25.423
is now n times the single
atom dipole moment.

00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:42.750
So therefore, what do we
expect for the radiated power?

00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:51.260
Well, if the
electromagnetic radiation

00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:54.450
by an oscillating electric or
an oscillating magnetic dipole

00:23:54.450 --> 00:23:57.890
moment scales with a
dipole moment squared,

00:23:57.890 --> 00:24:02.810
therefore, we would expect
that the power radiated

00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:07.960
is proportional to n squared.

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:11.780
And that means I have to take
the perfect of n [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:20.450
This means this is n times
higher than if you assume

00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:27.520
you have n individual
particles, and each of them

00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:30.250
emits electromagnetic radiation.

00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:32.560
what I'm telling you
is if you scatter

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:38.300
n spins through your
laboratory, you excite them.

00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:40.980
Pi over 2 pulse, they radiate.

00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:44.160
They radiate a power
which is proportion to n.

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:47.400
But if you put them all
together, localize them better

00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:50.150
than the wavelengths,
their radiated power

00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:52.880
is proportional to n
square, which is an n times

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:53.380
enhancement.

00:24:57.740 --> 00:25:06.290
So the way how I
put it for n spins--

00:25:06.290 --> 00:25:12.410
and this is a situation of
nuclear magnetic resonance--

00:25:12.410 --> 00:25:18.110
this is the completely
natural picture.

00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:22.110
But if I would have asked
you the question-- let's

00:25:22.110 --> 00:25:25.690
take n atoms which are excited
and put them close together,

00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:29.000
you say, well, each atom
does spontaneous emission,

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:34.100
and if you have n atoms,
we get n times c intensity

00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:36.100
you would have gotten
a different result.

00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:41.370
So we are so accustomed
to look at spins in NMR

00:25:41.370 --> 00:25:47.000
as a coherent system, look
that all the spins add up

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.430
to one giant antenna, to
one giant oscillating dipole

00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:53.960
moment, whereas for
atoms, we are so much used

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:56.700
to saying each atom is
its own particle and thus

00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:57.810
its own thing.

00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:15.220
So for n excited
atoms, they are usually

00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:16.400
regarded as independent.

00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:27.570
However-- and this is
the message of today--

00:26:27.570 --> 00:26:29.150
there shouldn't be a difference.

00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:32.383
All 2 level systems
are equivalent.

00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:48.320
Side remark-- for NMR in
spins, it is much, much easier

00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:51.310
to observe the effect,
because the condition

00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:54.410
that all the spins are
localized within one wavelength

00:26:54.410 --> 00:26:57.050
is always fulfilled
if the wavelength is

00:26:57.050 --> 00:26:58.750
meter or kilometers.

00:26:58.750 --> 00:27:00.710
But if you have
atoms which radiate

00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:05.490
at the optical wavelengths, this
condition becomes nontrivial.

00:27:05.490 --> 00:27:09.120
That is partially responsible
for the misconception

00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:11.340
that you treat the
two-level system which

00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:13.493
is a spin in your
head differently

00:27:13.493 --> 00:27:15.284
from the two-level
system which is an atom.

00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:34.130
So the important
difference here is lambda.

00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:41.320
And we have to compare
it with a sample size.

00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:46.240
And usually, the sample
size is much larger

00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:51.710
in the optical domain,
and is much, much smaller

00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:55.360
in the NMR domain.

00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:58.640
However-- and that's
what we'll see

00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:02.060
during the remainder
of this class--

00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:05.870
some of the dramatic
consequences of superradiance

00:28:05.870 --> 00:28:09.400
will even survive under
suitable conditions

00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:11.210
in the extended samples.

00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:14.560
So when we have samples
of excited atoms much,

00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:16.370
much larger than the
optical wavelengths,

00:28:16.370 --> 00:28:18.510
we can still observe
superradiance.

00:28:18.510 --> 00:28:20.960
So therefore, for
pedagogical reasons,

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:24.380
I first complete the
focus on the case

00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:26.730
that everything is
tightly localized.

00:28:26.730 --> 00:28:28.800
We derive some
interesting equations,

00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:30.590
and then we see how
they are modified

00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:32.160
when we go to extended samples.

00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:39.850
But I want to say, the
intuition from spin systems,

00:28:39.850 --> 00:28:42.265
the intuition from
classical precession

00:28:42.265 --> 00:28:45.820
and nuclear magnetic
resonance, will help us

00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:48.720
what happens for
electronically excited atoms.

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:51.460
So we want to use
this other spin 1/2

00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:54.678
system as a powerful
analogy to guide us.

00:28:58.550 --> 00:29:04.330
So before I start with the
angular momentum formalism,

00:29:04.330 --> 00:29:15.450
I want to emphasize that what
are the ingredients here.

00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:25.490
Well, we're talking about
coherence-- coherent radiation,

00:29:25.490 --> 00:29:29.250
coherence between atoms-- and
we'll talk about radiation.

00:29:29.250 --> 00:29:33.160
And the important part
here is the following.

00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:38.360
That when we talk
about radiation,

00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:50.230
we have the situation
that all atoms interact

00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:51.730
with a common radiation field.

00:29:57.550 --> 00:30:01.120
In other words, all the
spins, all the atoms

00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:04.373
have to emit their
photons into the same mode

00:30:04.373 --> 00:30:06.460
of the electromagnetic field.

00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:09.340
And therefore, you may
be right in some limit

00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:12.850
that the atoms are independent,
but not the photons they emit.

00:30:12.850 --> 00:30:15.530
They go into the same mode.

00:30:15.530 --> 00:30:30.563
And therefore, the emitted
photons cannot be treated

00:30:30.563 --> 00:30:31.146
independently.

00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:45.610
And that's why the
classical picture

00:30:45.610 --> 00:30:47.210
is so powerful for that.

00:30:47.210 --> 00:30:49.500
Because in the
classic picture, we

00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:52.710
do a coherent summation
of the field amplitudes.

00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:55.240
So we have constructive
interference.

00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:57.960
The superposition principle
of field amplitudes

00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:03.710
build into our equations and
deeply engraved in our brains.

00:31:03.710 --> 00:31:06.380
And that's why when we
use classical arguments,

00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:10.820
we automatically account for
that the photons interfere,

00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:13.245
that the photons are
emitted into the same mode

00:31:13.245 --> 00:31:16.610
of the electromagnetic field.

00:31:16.610 --> 00:31:21.640
And eventually, this
leads to the phenomenon

00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:27.870
that we have coherence
and enhancement when

00:31:27.870 --> 00:31:39.480
we look at spontaneous
emission for n atoms

00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:40.980
which are sufficiently
localized.

00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:59.330
So let me also discuss
what we have assumed here.

00:31:59.330 --> 00:32:02.560
Number one is, we
have assumed we

00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:06.740
have a localization
of the sample

00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:10.330
smaller than the
optical wavelengths.

00:32:10.330 --> 00:32:12.340
The other thing-- and
this is really important--

00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:15.530
we are talking here about
a collective phenomenon

00:32:15.530 --> 00:32:20.555
where n atoms act
together and do something.

00:32:20.555 --> 00:32:22.430
They develop the phenomenon
of superradiance.

00:32:22.430 --> 00:32:25.336
They decay much, much faster
than any individual atom could

00:32:25.336 --> 00:32:26.490
do by itself.

00:32:26.490 --> 00:32:30.720
But nevertheless, we have not
assumed-- or we have actually

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:33.120
excluded in our
description-- that there

00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:35.470
is any direct interaction
between the atoms.

00:32:35.470 --> 00:32:37.890
The atoms have no
[INAUDIBLE] interaction.

00:32:37.890 --> 00:32:39.500
They're not forming molecules.

00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:43.420
They're not part of a solid
with shared electrons.

00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:46.720
The atoms are, in that
sense, non-interacting.

00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:49.560
And therefore, in
a way, as long as

00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:51.040
they are just
atoms, independent.

00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:18.990
Finally-- and I want
you to think about it--

00:33:18.990 --> 00:33:21.710
you can think about
already for two atoms

00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:24.300
before we generalize
it to n atoms.

00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:26.370
Think about it.

00:33:26.370 --> 00:33:32.610
What was really the
assumption about the atoms?

00:33:32.610 --> 00:33:36.910
Do the atoms have to be bosons
to be in this symmetric state?

00:33:39.850 --> 00:33:42.466
Can they be fermions?

00:33:42.466 --> 00:33:45.600
Or can they be even
distinguishable particles?

00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:52.880
If the two atoms where
one would be a sodium atom

00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:55.740
and one would be a rubidium
atom-- but let's just

00:33:55.740 --> 00:33:59.560
say we live in a world where
sodium and rubidium atoms emit

00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:02.040
exactly the same color of light.

00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:05.330
Would we have been sub
and superradiant state

00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:08.710
for two atoms, one of which
is sodium and one of which

00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:09.210
is rubidium?

00:34:24.909 --> 00:34:25.409
Yes?

00:34:25.409 --> 00:34:26.361
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:33.929 --> 00:34:34.720
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:37.120
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:39.909
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:34:39.909 --> 00:34:41.429
And that confuses many people.

00:34:41.429 --> 00:34:44.020
It is the indistinguishability
of the photons

00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:45.440
they have emitted.

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:48.400
It is the common mode where
the photons are emitted.

00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:53.110
The atoms can be distinguished.

00:34:53.110 --> 00:34:57.820
Also, we've made the assumption
that the atoms are localized to

00:34:57.820 --> 00:35:05.160
within an area which is
much smaller than lambda.

00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:08.530
But you could imagine you
have a solid state matrix

00:35:08.530 --> 00:35:11.660
and you have one atom
here, one atom there,

00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:14.510
and you can go with a
microscope and distinguish them.

00:35:14.510 --> 00:35:16.890
So therefore, the moment
you can distinguish them

00:35:16.890 --> 00:35:18.900
because they are pinned
down in a lattice--

00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:22.180
or if you don't like a lattice,
take two microscopic ion traps

00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:24.380
a few nanometers
apart, and you tightly

00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:26.720
hold onto two ions--
it doesn't matter

00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:28.910
whether they are
bosons or fermions.

00:35:28.910 --> 00:35:31.740
It only matters whether
your bosons or fermions

00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:34.520
when the atomic wave
functions overlap

00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:35.810
and you have to symmatrize it.

00:35:35.810 --> 00:35:40.130
As long as you have two atoms
which are spatially separated,

00:35:40.130 --> 00:35:44.250
it doesn't matter whether
they are bosons or fermions.

00:35:44.250 --> 00:35:47.550
And that also means they can
be completely different atoms.

00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:49.010
You can already
call the Boson A,

00:35:49.010 --> 00:35:52.300
Boson B. Now you can call
it sodium and rubidium,

00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:55.940
and they can have different
numbers of nucleus.

00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:58.980
They can be different numbers
of neutrons in the nucleus.

00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:01.490
It could be different
isotopes of the same atom.

00:36:01.490 --> 00:36:06.230
The whole collective
phenomenon comes

00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:08.986
when they emit a photon
into the same mode.

00:36:39.550 --> 00:36:40.250
OK.

00:36:40.250 --> 00:36:49.129
So now we want to
treat to a formula

00:36:49.129 --> 00:36:50.295
treatment for end particles.

00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:58.950
So we have now the individual
pseudo spins one half.

00:36:58.950 --> 00:37:02.460
We perform now with some
overall end particles.

00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:05.350
We get the total spin s.

00:37:05.350 --> 00:37:07.440
The total spin s
quantum number has

00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:09.830
to be smaller or
equal to n over 2,

00:37:09.830 --> 00:37:12.335
because we have m
spin 1/2 systems.

00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:24.100
The end quantum
number is 1/2 times

00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:27.990
the difference of
the atoms which

00:37:27.990 --> 00:37:30.495
are in the excited state
minus the atoms which

00:37:30.495 --> 00:37:32.270
are in the ground state.

00:37:32.270 --> 00:37:34.250
And this is, of course, trivial.

00:37:34.250 --> 00:37:36.210
Trivially must be
smaller than s.

00:37:38.790 --> 00:37:45.520
Because m is this
z component of s.

00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:50.990
And we are now
describing the system

00:37:50.990 --> 00:37:56.030
by the eigenstates s and
n of the collective spin.

00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:12.270
So that means we have
the following situation.

00:38:12.270 --> 00:38:18.470
We have a manifold-- we want to
show now all the energy levels.

00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:22.920
We have a manifold which
has a maximum spin n over 2.

00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:26.790
The next manifold
has n over 2 minus 1.

00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:32.150
And the last one
has-- let's assume

00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:35.480
we have an odd number of
particles-- x equals 1/2.

00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:42.700
So here, we have
now n energy levels.

00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:46.582
We can go from all
the n atoms excited

00:38:46.582 --> 00:38:50.970
to all the n atoms
being de-excited.

00:38:50.970 --> 00:38:58.545
In the following manifold,
we have s is one less.

00:39:01.110 --> 00:39:07.410
And therefore, we have
a letter of states

00:39:07.410 --> 00:39:09.030
which is a little bit shorter.

00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:16.360
And eventually,
for s equals 1/2,

00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:19.305
we have only two components
plus 1/2 and minus 1/2.

00:39:25.210 --> 00:39:34.900
So those levels interact with
the electromagnetic field.

00:39:37.470 --> 00:39:40.490
The operator of the
electromagnetic field,

00:39:40.490 --> 00:39:43.300
we have already
derived that, involves

00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:47.400
the sum of all of the little
sigma pluses, sigma i pluses,

00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:53.960
and we call the sum of all
of them s plus and s minus.

00:39:53.960 --> 00:40:04.500
And the matrix element is
now for spontaneous emission.

00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:07.370
You have a state with sm.

00:40:07.370 --> 00:40:13.900
s minus is the lowering operator
for the n particle system,

00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:17.090
so it goes from a state
with a certain number

00:40:17.090 --> 00:40:20.600
of atomic excitations
to one excitation less,

00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:25.150
and that means this is the
act of emitting spontaneously

00:40:25.150 --> 00:40:27.400
one photon.

00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:32.960
The operator s minus stays
within the s manifold,

00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:36.560
so we state in the
same letter, which

00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:39.350
is characterized by
the quantum number s.

00:40:39.350 --> 00:40:42.230
But we lower the end
quantum number by one.

00:40:42.230 --> 00:40:44.000
The end quantum
number is a measure

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:47.130
of the number of excitations.

00:40:47.130 --> 00:40:51.680
And we know from
general spin algebra

00:40:51.680 --> 00:41:02.020
that this matrix element is s
minus m plus 1 times s plus n.

00:41:10.490 --> 00:41:12.020
There are, of
course, pre-factors

00:41:12.020 --> 00:41:15.770
like the dipole matrix
element of a single atom.

00:41:15.770 --> 00:41:20.890
But I always want to normalize
things to a single atom.

00:41:20.890 --> 00:41:25.900
And by just using
the square root,

00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:30.470
if you have a single particle,
which is in the s to m

00:41:30.470 --> 00:41:36.260
equals 1/2 state, then you
see that it this square root

00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:38.370
is just 1.

00:41:38.370 --> 00:41:42.940
So therefore, for when I discuss
now the relative strengths

00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:46.690
of the transitions
between those eigenstates,

00:41:46.690 --> 00:41:49.060
I've always normalized
to a single particle.

00:41:49.060 --> 00:41:52.370
For a single particle, the
transition matrix element is 1.

00:42:03.900 --> 00:42:04.980
OK.

00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:09.620
So therefore, what we
want to discuss now is,

00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:13.140
we want to discuss
the rate, which

00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:16.720
is the matrix element
squared, or the intensity

00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:31.140
of the observed radiation
relative to a single particle.

00:42:38.100 --> 00:42:42.180
So the intensity-- and this
is what we are talking about--

00:42:42.180 --> 00:42:45.910
is now the square root of the
square root, or the square

00:42:45.910 --> 00:42:53.974
of the square root, which is s
minus 1 plus m times s plus m.

00:42:56.820 --> 00:43:00.870
Pretty much, this is
the complete description

00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:04.660
of superradiance for
strongly localized atoms.

00:43:04.660 --> 00:43:07.250
It's all in this one formula.

00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:10.120
Once we learned how to
classify the states,

00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:12.550
we can just borrow
all the results

00:43:12.550 --> 00:43:17.590
from angular momentum, addition,
and angular momentum operators.

00:43:17.590 --> 00:43:24.120
So I want to use this
formula for the intensity

00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:31.190
and look at which is the most
superradiant state, the state

00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:33.780
where all the particles
are symmetric.

00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:36.220
And this is a
state with s equals

00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:41.380
n where the spin is n over 2.

00:43:41.380 --> 00:43:48.670
So I'm looking now at
the letter of m states,

00:43:48.670 --> 00:43:52.350
and I want to figure
out what happens.

00:43:52.350 --> 00:43:55.810
So the maximum m
state is m equals s,

00:43:55.810 --> 00:43:59.460
all the atoms are excited.

00:43:59.460 --> 00:44:05.650
And now the first
photon gets emitted.

00:44:05.650 --> 00:44:19.780
So just put s equals m equals
n half into the formula

00:44:19.780 --> 00:44:26.390
for the intensity, and you find
that the intensity gives us

00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:28.173
this expression is just n.

00:44:31.490 --> 00:44:36.790
So we have n excited
atoms, and they initially

00:44:36.790 --> 00:44:41.130
emit with an
intensity which is n.

00:44:41.130 --> 00:44:45.630
And this is the same as for n
completely independent atoms.

00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:56.240
So nothing really special
to write home about.

00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:59.570
But now we should go
further down the ladder,

00:44:59.570 --> 00:45:05.050
and let's look at the state
which has m equals zero.

00:45:05.050 --> 00:45:16.320
Well, then the intensity
of the matrix element

00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:20.950
squared for the transition,
which goes to m equals zero,

00:45:20.950 --> 00:45:25.820
has an intensity
which is n over 2.

00:45:25.820 --> 00:45:29.540
I will just look. s is
n over 2, and m is zero.

00:45:29.540 --> 00:45:31.300
So we have the
question whether we

00:45:31.300 --> 00:45:37.020
have odd or even
number of particles,

00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:38.410
but it doesn't really matter.

00:45:38.410 --> 00:45:42.850
What dominates is always
the big factor n over 2.

00:45:42.850 --> 00:45:46.850
So what we find
out is that we have

00:45:46.850 --> 00:45:50.680
an enhancement, huge enhancement
over independent atom,

00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:53.830
because this intensity
goes with n squared,

00:45:53.830 --> 00:45:56.560
and this proportionality
to n squared,

00:45:56.560 --> 00:45:58.060
this is a hallmark
of superradiance.

00:46:00.710 --> 00:46:06.980
So this is what
is characteristic

00:46:06.980 --> 00:46:09.040
for superradiance.

00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:17.920
We have an n times enhancement
relative to the a singular

00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:19.680
atom.

00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:37.440
So this is one important aspect.

00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:41.860
Now, in the classical
picture, that

00:46:41.860 --> 00:46:43.420
should come very naturally.

00:46:43.420 --> 00:46:45.610
If you have all
the spins aligned

00:46:45.610 --> 00:46:48.460
and they start the
[INAUDIBLE] procession,

00:46:48.460 --> 00:46:51.470
there is not a lot of
oscillating dipole moment.

00:46:51.470 --> 00:46:55.460
But when half of the
spins are de-excited,

00:46:55.460 --> 00:46:57.410
they are now in the XY plane.

00:46:57.410 --> 00:47:02.310
Now you have this giant antenna
which oscillates and radiates.

00:47:02.310 --> 00:47:04.230
So it's clear that
at the beginning,

00:47:04.230 --> 00:47:07.310
the effect is less pronounced,
and if you're halfway

00:47:07.310 --> 00:47:10.225
down the Bloch sphere, then
you would expect this n times

00:47:10.225 --> 00:47:10.725
enhancement.

00:47:16.190 --> 00:47:18.610
But now let's go
further down the ladder

00:47:18.610 --> 00:47:24.530
and ask what happens when
we arrive at the end.

00:47:24.530 --> 00:47:31.330
So I'm asking now, what
is the intensity when

00:47:31.330 --> 00:47:36.150
the last photon gets emitted.

00:47:39.090 --> 00:47:42.570
There is only one
excitation in the system.

00:47:42.570 --> 00:47:47.510
And the answer is, it's not
one like an independent atom.

00:47:47.510 --> 00:47:52.950
If you inspect the square root
expression, you find it's n.

00:47:52.950 --> 00:47:55.870
So we have one
excitation in the system,

00:47:55.870 --> 00:47:57.270
but it's completely symmetrized.

00:48:02.750 --> 00:48:05.320
And therefore, we have
an n times enhancement.

00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:11.410
And I want to show you
where it comes about.

00:48:11.410 --> 00:48:13.750
So there's only one
particle excited.

00:48:17.570 --> 00:48:20.735
And here, we have an
n times enhancement.

00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:28.630
By the way, the states with
the classification s and m

00:48:28.630 --> 00:48:31.070
are called the
[INAUDIBLE] state.

00:48:31.070 --> 00:48:34.350
And this state here, which
has a single excitation

00:48:34.350 --> 00:48:37.830
but it radiates n times
faster than a single atom,

00:48:37.830 --> 00:48:39.800
is a very special
[INAUDIBLE] state.

00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:43.580
And there is currently an effort
in Professor [INAUDIBLE] lab

00:48:43.580 --> 00:48:47.530
to realize in a very
well-controlled way

00:48:47.530 --> 00:48:50.790
this special [INAUDIBLE]
state in the laboratory.

00:48:50.790 --> 00:48:53.340
There are non-classical
states, because they're not

00:48:53.340 --> 00:48:57.790
behaving as you would
maybe naturally assume

00:48:57.790 --> 00:49:00.930
a system with a single
excitation to behave.

00:49:06.140 --> 00:49:11.290
So let's maybe try to
shed some light on it.

00:49:11.290 --> 00:49:14.490
One way how you can intuitively
understand superradiance

00:49:14.490 --> 00:49:16.810
is really with a
classical antenna picture

00:49:16.810 --> 00:49:20.170
that you have n spins which
form a microscopic dipole

00:49:20.170 --> 00:49:22.690
moment which oscillates.

00:49:22.690 --> 00:49:25.860
And this is a very nice picture
to understand the n times

00:49:25.860 --> 00:49:29.230
enhancement when we
have half of the atoms

00:49:29.230 --> 00:49:31.690
excited and the other
half de-excited.

00:49:31.690 --> 00:49:33.380
Let me now give
you a nice argument

00:49:33.380 --> 00:49:38.290
which explains why a single
excitation in this system

00:49:38.290 --> 00:49:41.620
now leads to an n
times enhanced decay.

00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:47.860
The situation is that
the initial state

00:49:47.860 --> 00:49:53.090
for this last photon is,
we have an excited atom,

00:49:53.090 --> 00:49:56.640
and all the atoms are
in the ground state.

00:49:56.640 --> 00:50:02.420
However, we could also
have in this nomenclature

00:50:02.420 --> 00:50:03.765
the second atom excited.

00:50:09.460 --> 00:50:15.070
Or we could have the third
one excited, and so on.

00:50:15.070 --> 00:50:19.110
So therefore, what we
have is-- because we

00:50:19.110 --> 00:50:25.780
are in the left-most [INAUDIBLE]
which has the maximum s spin

00:50:25.780 --> 00:50:28.060
quantum number of n
over 2, that means

00:50:28.060 --> 00:50:30.260
everything is fully symmetrized.

00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:32.370
So therefore, we have
to fully symmetrize

00:50:32.370 --> 00:50:35.800
by summing over the
n possibilities.

00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:44.420
And our final state is, of
course, the fully symmetrized

00:50:44.420 --> 00:50:46.040
[INAUDIBLE] state.

00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:49.110
And now you realize
that you have

00:50:49.110 --> 00:50:55.510
a coherent summation over--
you have n contributions.

00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:09.380
So therefore, the matrix
element has n contributions

00:51:09.380 --> 00:51:10.860
compared to single atom.

00:51:10.860 --> 00:51:13.730
The normalization is
only square root n.

00:51:13.730 --> 00:51:21.640
So therefore, the matrix element
is square root n times larger

00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:24.710
than for an individual atom.

00:51:30.380 --> 00:51:34.080
So by simply having
one atom excited and n

00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:38.360
minus 1 atom not
excited, but if you now

00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:40.580
have the fully
symmetrized state,

00:51:40.580 --> 00:51:46.350
you don't know for fundamental
reasons which atom is excited.

00:51:46.350 --> 00:51:49.010
You have a superposition
state where the excitation

00:51:49.010 --> 00:51:51.140
can be with either of the atom.

00:51:51.140 --> 00:51:54.550
This state, which has a
similar quantum of excitation,

00:51:54.550 --> 00:51:57.528
radiates n times faster
than a single atom would.

00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:08.350
Let me make a side remark.

00:52:13.470 --> 00:52:19.070
Maybe some of you remember when
we went to [INAUDIBLE] QED,

00:52:19.070 --> 00:52:22.390
we had just proudly quantized
the electromagnetic field,

00:52:22.390 --> 00:52:25.530
and we discussed the
vacuum Rabi splitting.

00:52:25.530 --> 00:52:29.060
And I told you that the
vacuum Rabi splitting

00:52:29.060 --> 00:52:37.420
is if the cavity is not empty
but is filled with n atoms,

00:52:37.420 --> 00:52:42.790
because of the matrix element
of the a dagger operator,

00:52:42.790 --> 00:52:46.240
you get an enhancement of the
vacuum Rabi splitting, which

00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:49.010
is square root n,
then photon number.

00:52:49.010 --> 00:52:52.110
But then I showed you the
important first observation,

00:52:52.110 --> 00:52:55.410
the pioneering research at Cal
Tech by JF Kimball and Gerhard

00:52:55.410 --> 00:52:58.570
Rempe, and they didn't
vary the photon number.

00:52:58.570 --> 00:53:00.810
They varied the atom number.

00:53:00.810 --> 00:53:03.650
And when they had more
flux in the atomic beam,

00:53:03.650 --> 00:53:06.840
the Rabi splitting
became larger and larger.

00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:10.320
Well, we've just
learned that when

00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:19.630
we have n atoms, that the matrix
element for emitting the photon

00:53:19.630 --> 00:53:22.020
is square root n times enhanced.

00:53:22.020 --> 00:53:25.730
So if you put n atoms in a
cavity filled with little n

00:53:25.730 --> 00:53:30.140
photons, the Rabi splitting
between the two modes

00:53:30.140 --> 00:53:33.080
has square root n plus
1 in the photon number

00:53:33.080 --> 00:53:37.200
and square root big
n in the atom number.

00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:40.470
So the effect I've shown you in
the demonstration of the vacuum

00:53:40.470 --> 00:53:44.160
Rabi splitting is this
scaling with the atom number.

00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:47.772
This actually can be understood
as a superradiant effect.

00:54:02.550 --> 00:54:04.970
OK.

00:54:04.970 --> 00:54:07.910
So that's pretty
much what I wanted

00:54:07.910 --> 00:54:14.240
to tell you about the basic
phenomenon of superradiance.

00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:15.830
Now I want to discuss
two more things.

00:54:15.830 --> 00:54:18.596
One is superradiance
in an extended sample.

00:54:18.596 --> 00:54:20.290
Ad we have time for that.

00:54:20.290 --> 00:54:25.190
But I also want to discuss
with you the question.

00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:27.230
Let's assume we have
the same system,

00:54:27.230 --> 00:54:30.480
and we just convinced ourselves,
yes, it's superradiant.

00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:33.157
Photons are emitted
n times faster.

00:54:36.020 --> 00:54:41.900
Now, what would you think
will happen when we are not

00:54:41.900 --> 00:54:44.060
looking for
spontaneous emission,

00:54:44.060 --> 00:54:46.100
but we shine a
laser light on it,

00:54:46.100 --> 00:54:49.750
and we are asking
for induced emission?

00:54:49.750 --> 00:54:52.987
Or the other way
around-- we ask--

00:54:52.987 --> 00:54:54.820
and you know that from
Einstein's treatment,

00:54:54.820 --> 00:54:56.610
it's completely
recipocal-- where

00:54:56.610 --> 00:55:01.253
we are asking the question,
what happens to the absorption

00:55:01.253 --> 00:55:01.753
process?

00:55:06.690 --> 00:55:13.530
So is a stimulated emission
process or an absorption

00:55:13.530 --> 00:55:17.685
process, are they
also enhanced n times?

00:55:21.329 --> 00:55:21.870
I don't know.

00:55:21.870 --> 00:55:26.307
Do you have any
opinions about that?

00:55:41.714 --> 00:55:42.708
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:56.540 --> 00:55:58.680
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:55:58.680 --> 00:56:00.520
It's a subtle way of counting.

00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:03.710
I've shown you that certain
matrix element-- especially

00:56:03.710 --> 00:56:09.080
the matrix element when
the spin is in the middle,

00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:14.420
is at 90 degrees-- that we
have matrix elements which

00:56:14.420 --> 00:56:16.470
are n times enhanced.

00:56:16.470 --> 00:56:20.270
And of course, if you ask
for absorption or stimulated

00:56:20.270 --> 00:56:23.740
emission, we are talking to
a system which has an n times

00:56:23.740 --> 00:56:25.760
enhanced matrix element.

00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:29.510
And you would say,
things go n times faster.

00:56:29.510 --> 00:56:33.000
Why don't you hold this
thought for a moment?

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:34.766
Now let me just wear
another hat and let

00:56:34.766 --> 00:56:38.410
me say that we have assumed
that we have n independent

00:56:38.410 --> 00:56:40.740
spins that are closely
next to each other,

00:56:40.740 --> 00:56:42.880
but they're not interacting.

00:56:42.880 --> 00:56:50.110
And now I take these n spins,
and for stimulated emission

00:56:50.110 --> 00:56:53.670
and absorption, we can just use
a picture of Rabi oscillation.

00:56:53.670 --> 00:56:55.570
On the first Rabi
cycle, we emit.

00:56:55.570 --> 00:56:57.990
On the next Rabi
cycle, we absorb.

00:56:57.990 --> 00:57:00.030
So if I take now--
and why don't you

00:57:00.030 --> 00:57:03.972
think not about these
pseudo spins electronically,

00:57:03.972 --> 00:57:05.430
atoms with [INAUDIBLE]
excitation--

00:57:05.430 --> 00:57:08.350
just think of real spins
which have a magnetic moment,

00:57:08.350 --> 00:57:10.750
and you drive them to
the magnetic field.

00:57:10.750 --> 00:57:12.890
So now you have
your n little spins.

00:57:12.890 --> 00:57:14.840
You apply a magnetic
field to them,

00:57:14.840 --> 00:57:16.760
time-dependent
magnetic field, and

00:57:16.760 --> 00:57:18.860
the time-dependent
magnetic field

00:57:18.860 --> 00:57:23.070
is now driving the spin
in Rabi oscillations.

00:57:23.070 --> 00:57:27.630
And the external drive
field talks to one spin,

00:57:27.630 --> 00:57:30.040
talks to the next,
talks to all of them.

00:57:30.040 --> 00:57:33.920
But each of the
spins does exactly

00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:37.830
the same Rabi oscillation it
would do if all the other atoms

00:57:37.830 --> 00:57:40.840
where not present.

00:57:40.840 --> 00:57:44.480
So the picture is, you
have an external field.

00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:47.020
All the atoms couple
to the external field.

00:57:47.020 --> 00:57:49.980
But the coupling of each
atom to this external field

00:57:49.980 --> 00:57:52.500
is exactly the same
as of a single atom

00:57:52.500 --> 00:57:53.990
coupling to the external field.

00:57:53.990 --> 00:57:56.890
And the Rabi frequency
for each atom

00:57:56.890 --> 00:57:59.230
is exactly the
Rabi frequency you

00:57:59.230 --> 00:58:01.990
would get for a single atom.

00:58:01.990 --> 00:58:03.800
So therefore, based
on this picture,

00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:06.750
I would expect that
I have my end spins,

00:58:06.750 --> 00:58:09.180
and these can now be real
spins with a magnetic moment,

00:58:09.180 --> 00:58:12.590
or can be atoms in the
electronically excited state.

00:58:12.590 --> 00:58:15.490
I coherently drive them
with a drive field,

00:58:15.490 --> 00:58:17.680
and they will do
Rabi oscillations.

00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:20.140
But the frequency
or Rabi oscillations

00:58:20.140 --> 00:58:23.950
will be the same as
for a single atom.

00:58:23.950 --> 00:58:24.450
OK.

00:58:24.450 --> 00:58:26.890
We've just held the
thought that their matrix

00:58:26.890 --> 00:58:30.910
elements in the Dickey
states, which are square root

00:58:30.910 --> 00:58:34.270
n times larger, and
the Dickey state

00:58:34.270 --> 00:58:36.680
seem to suggest
something to us which

00:58:36.680 --> 00:58:38.950
would say there should
be an enhancement,

00:58:38.950 --> 00:58:42.470
whereas the analysis
in independent atoms,

00:58:42.470 --> 00:58:48.210
which are driven by an external
field, also seems compelling.

00:58:48.210 --> 00:58:51.570
So now we have to reconcile
the two approaches.

00:58:51.570 --> 00:58:53.920
Is the question clear?

00:58:53.920 --> 00:58:56.980
We want to figure out-- we have
matrix elements in the Dickey

00:58:56.980 --> 00:59:00.010
state which suggest enhancement,
but the simple picture

00:59:00.010 --> 00:59:02.960
of n independent atoms
driven by an external field

00:59:02.960 --> 00:59:06.910
would say there
is no enhancement.

00:59:06.910 --> 00:59:07.700
OK.

00:59:07.700 --> 00:59:13.440
So let me just write down more
formally what I explained.

00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:17.100
When we have an initial
state, which is all the atoms

00:59:17.100 --> 00:59:24.910
are in the ground
state to the power n,

00:59:24.910 --> 00:59:29.720
and the state n
would evolve when

00:59:29.720 --> 00:59:39.000
it is driven in
a state phi of t,

00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:49.200
so now the exact wave
function for our n particles

00:59:49.200 --> 00:59:52.360
is nothing else than the
time-dependent solution

00:59:52.360 --> 00:59:56.680
of Schrodinger's equation
for the single particle.

00:59:56.680 --> 01:00:08.550
So this is single
particle to the power n.

01:00:12.870 --> 01:00:16.380
So therefore, this is pretty
much a mathematical proof

01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:22.450
unless I've made a
mistake, which I haven't.

01:00:22.450 --> 01:00:34.580
So it takes exactly half
a single atom Rabi period

01:00:34.580 --> 01:00:48.930
to completely invert
the population exactly

01:00:48.930 --> 01:00:50.759
s for a single atom.

01:00:56.990 --> 01:01:03.630
So that's the result.

01:01:03.630 --> 01:01:18.010
However, if you describe
the system by Dickie states,

01:01:18.010 --> 01:01:27.040
you have matrix element which
are matrix elements which

01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:28.250
are proportional to n.

01:01:30.910 --> 01:01:35.280
However, if you want to--
I've described it just

01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:36.390
as a two-level system.

01:01:36.390 --> 01:01:38.040
Each atom does Rabi oscillation.

01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:42.220
I've said, OK, the
system of n atoms

01:01:42.220 --> 01:01:44.860
is just n individual systems.

01:01:44.860 --> 01:01:49.160
But if you insist to describe
it as a collective spin,

01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:50.970
then we have the Dickie states.

01:01:50.970 --> 01:01:52.620
Then we have the n
times enhancement

01:01:52.620 --> 01:01:53.940
of the matrix element.

01:01:53.940 --> 01:01:57.490
But then we also have
to go through n states.

01:01:57.490 --> 01:02:00.470
So we have n steps in
the Dickie letter ladder.

01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:07.820
And one can say now-- and
this is the exact argument--

01:02:07.820 --> 01:02:09.680
you have n steps.

01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:11.990
You take each step
n times faster,

01:02:11.990 --> 01:02:16.040
but the total time is the same.

01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:20.210
So n times 1 over n is 1.

01:02:20.210 --> 01:02:21.440
OK.

01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:28.360
But now when we talk about
spontaneous emission,

01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:31.220
we are not driving the system
with an external field.

01:02:31.220 --> 01:02:34.380
It's really driven by the system
itself, which emits photons

01:02:34.380 --> 01:02:36.070
into the empty mode.

01:02:36.070 --> 01:02:42.840
Spontaneous emission,
each step is

01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:48.800
proportional to the
matrix element squared,

01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:50.530
because we're talking
about [INAUDIBLE]

01:02:50.530 --> 01:02:52.060
spontaneous emission.

01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:55.990
So this is proportional
to n square.

01:02:55.990 --> 01:03:00.500
And if you say that
we have n steps,

01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:06.980
well, then we have
n squared over n.

01:03:06.980 --> 01:03:10.060
Then we have a speed up.

01:03:10.060 --> 01:03:13.730
Each step is n squared faster.

01:03:13.730 --> 01:03:17.095
We divide by n, and we
get the superradiant speed

01:03:17.095 --> 01:03:18.700
of which is n.

01:03:18.700 --> 01:03:22.590
So superradiance is something
that you observe in spontaneous

01:03:22.590 --> 01:03:26.840
emission, but you cannot
absorb it in a driven system.

01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:28.340
Because in a driven
system, you can

01:03:28.340 --> 01:03:30.630
say you have a classical
external field.

01:03:30.630 --> 01:03:33.090
And this external
talks to one atom,

01:03:33.090 --> 01:03:35.460
to n atoms exactly
in the same way.

01:03:35.460 --> 01:03:38.935
It is really the interference
of spontaneously emitted photons

01:03:38.935 --> 01:03:40.560
which is at the heart
of superradiance.

01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:52.860
As a side remark,
we are talking here

01:03:52.860 --> 01:03:58.780
about coherent effect,
which is n times enhanced.

01:03:58.780 --> 01:04:01.610
And you can actually
regard that as a kind

01:04:01.610 --> 01:04:06.510
of bosonic enhancement in
the emission of photons,

01:04:06.510 --> 01:04:10.070
because the photons are bosons.

01:04:10.070 --> 01:04:13.360
When Bose-Einstein
condensation was discovered

01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:17.000
and people were thinking about
basic experiments, of course,

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.120
one thing which
was on our mind is,

01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:21.580
we wanted to show that
there are processes

01:04:21.580 --> 01:04:25.310
in the Bose-Einstein condensate
we are n times enhanced.

01:04:25.310 --> 01:04:27.110
For fermions, they
would be suppressed.

01:04:27.110 --> 01:04:28.590
This is the flip side.

01:04:28.590 --> 01:04:30.710
Big enhancements for
bosons, complete suppression

01:04:30.710 --> 01:04:32.160
for fermions.

01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:35.730
And we found that, for instance,
the formation of the condensate

01:04:35.730 --> 01:04:37.890
had an n times enhancement.

01:04:37.890 --> 01:04:40.670
There was a stimulation factor.

01:04:40.670 --> 01:04:44.160
But we also thought you
should actually-- there may

01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:48.370
be ways where you can observe
suppression of light scattering

01:04:48.370 --> 01:04:50.930
or enhancement of
light scattering.

01:04:50.930 --> 01:04:54.190
But we thought about it with
two laser beam [INAUDIBLE]

01:04:54.190 --> 01:04:56.540
scattering, and the
idea seemed compelling.

01:04:56.540 --> 01:04:58.100
And then we said,
no, wait a moment.

01:04:58.100 --> 01:05:02.000
If you use laser beams,
everything is stimulated.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:06.190
You can observe
bosonic enhancement

01:05:06.190 --> 01:05:08.470
and fermeonic
suppression only when

01:05:08.470 --> 01:05:10.270
you have spontaneous events.

01:05:10.270 --> 01:05:13.150
If you drive it in a
unitary time evolution,

01:05:13.150 --> 01:05:16.580
you will not be able to see
quantum statistical suppression

01:05:16.580 --> 01:05:17.750
or enhancement.

01:05:17.750 --> 01:05:19.940
And the same thing as
we have seen here--

01:05:19.940 --> 01:05:22.440
when you have a
stimulated system,

01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:26.240
everything is undergoing
a unitary time evolution,

01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:28.570
and the unitary time
evolution for n atoms

01:05:28.570 --> 01:05:30.460
is the same as
for a single atom.

01:05:30.460 --> 01:05:34.360
You need the element of
spontaneous emission.

01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:39.450
So I'm not proving it
to you, but I'm just

01:05:39.450 --> 01:05:42.080
making as a remark--
what we have seen here,

01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:44.100
that the superradiance
only shows up

01:05:44.100 --> 01:05:46.660
in spontaneous emission
and not when we drive

01:05:46.660 --> 01:05:50.400
the system-- a driven system
is a unitary evolution.

01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:55.240
And the same conclusion which
we just got for superradiance

01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:59.070
also applies if you want to
observe fermionic suppression

01:05:59.070 --> 01:06:02.440
or pulsonic enhancement
in quantum gases.

01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:04.485
It needs an element of
spontaneous scattering

01:06:04.485 --> 01:06:06.229
or spontaneous emission.

01:06:06.229 --> 01:06:07.696
Yes?

01:06:07.696 --> 01:06:11.119
AUDIENCE: If we think of
it in terms of interference

01:06:11.119 --> 01:06:14.053
of photons, how does
that tie in here?

01:06:14.053 --> 01:06:17.965
Because if the stimulated
[INAUDIBLE] photons are still

01:06:17.965 --> 01:06:22.366
interfering, then you can
get emission [INAUDIBLE].

01:06:26.278 --> 01:06:28.720
PROFFESOR: The
quick answer is, you

01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:32.790
have a classical field which
you use for-- you have a laser

01:06:32.790 --> 01:06:35.050
field for stimulate
emission for absorption.

01:06:35.050 --> 01:06:37.180
There are so many photons
in the laser field

01:06:37.180 --> 01:06:40.710
that the few photons which your
system emits do not matter.

01:06:40.710 --> 01:06:42.840
They are really talking
to a classical field,

01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:46.730
and it doesn't matter whether
the other n minus 1 atoms

01:06:46.730 --> 01:06:49.560
have emitted a photon, because
you have zillions of photons

01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:51.225
in your laser field,
and they determine

01:06:51.225 --> 01:06:52.486
the dynamics of the system.

01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:04.500
OK.

01:07:04.500 --> 01:07:07.290
Super radiance would
not be as important

01:07:07.290 --> 01:07:14.790
as it is if it could not
observed in extended samples.

01:07:14.790 --> 01:07:18.040
So now I want to use
the last 10 minutes

01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:24.050
to show you what
is kept and what

01:07:24.050 --> 01:07:27.270
has to be dropped when we
talk about extended samples.

01:07:39.390 --> 01:07:45.100
So let's-- it doesn't
really matter,

01:07:45.100 --> 01:07:49.252
but for pedagogical reasons,
let's assume we have

01:07:49.252 --> 01:07:52.480
an extended sample
which is much,

01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:58.160
much longer than the optical
wavelengths along the long axis

01:07:58.160 --> 01:08:01.350
of the cigar and smaller
along the short axis.

01:08:01.350 --> 01:08:02.930
The second condition
that the cigar

01:08:02.930 --> 01:08:05.610
is smaller than along the long
axis does not really matter.

01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:32.810
No, I'm not making
this assumption.

01:08:32.810 --> 01:08:36.550
So it's a cigar, and
let's just assume

01:08:36.550 --> 01:08:43.819
that everything is-- just saw
a contradiction in my notes.

01:08:43.819 --> 01:08:46.430
So anyway, we have
now a system which

01:08:46.430 --> 01:08:53.490
is-- let's have a Cuban
cigar, a really thick cigar.

01:08:53.490 --> 01:08:56.490
And this is now our
extended sample.

01:08:56.490 --> 01:09:02.689
And what I need is, I need the
cross section of the sample A.

01:09:02.689 --> 01:09:08.840
And let's assume
the length is l.

01:09:12.779 --> 01:09:14.090
This is diameter d.

01:09:14.090 --> 01:09:18.200
It's a cigar much,
much larger than here.

01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:22.970
And yes, we are talking
about superradiance,

01:09:22.970 --> 01:09:25.010
we are talking about
spontaneous emission.

01:09:25.010 --> 01:09:29.109
But if you see a long
cigar with excited atoms,

01:09:29.109 --> 01:09:32.390
you think immediately
about lasing action.

01:09:32.390 --> 01:09:35.870
The photon is emitted is
amplified along the path.

01:09:35.870 --> 01:09:38.720
And of course, the
preferred direction

01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:41.810
where you would expect the
maximum effect to happen

01:09:41.810 --> 01:09:44.540
is when the light is
emitted along the long axis

01:09:44.540 --> 01:09:45.680
of the cigar.

01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:57.180
So you want to consider
now preferential modes

01:09:57.180 --> 01:09:58.786
along the x-axis.

01:10:01.780 --> 01:10:10.200
So if you now assume
that you have many atoms,

01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:14.650
and they emit light, if an atom
here and here would emit light

01:10:14.650 --> 01:10:17.380
in this direction, it may
constructively interfere.

01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:22.090
But in another direction, it
will destructively interfere.

01:10:22.090 --> 01:10:28.480
But let us now consider what is
the solid angle into which all

01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:31.550
of the atoms can
coherently emit.

01:10:31.550 --> 01:10:38.760
Well, you know that from
classical optics, the emission

01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:46.970
into a solid angle of lambda
square over a can be coherent.

01:10:53.250 --> 01:10:55.670
Sort of similar to when
you have a double slit

01:10:55.670 --> 01:10:59.016
and you ask, over what angle
do the two slits emit inface.

01:10:59.016 --> 01:11:01.140
You get a bright fringe,
and you get a dark fringe,

01:11:01.140 --> 01:11:02.750
you get the next bright fringe.

01:11:02.750 --> 01:11:06.090
The coherence, the angle
over which the pass lengths

01:11:06.090 --> 01:11:10.360
differences do not add
up to more than lambda.

01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:15.060
It's the deflection-limited
angle which for a beam of size

01:11:15.060 --> 01:11:17.270
d is lambda over d.

01:11:17.270 --> 01:11:19.090
And if you take it to
the second dimension,

01:11:19.090 --> 01:11:21.460
the solid angle is lambda
squared over d squared.

01:11:21.460 --> 01:11:23.970
So that's what
I'm talking about.

01:11:23.970 --> 01:11:28.260
So if you would give all
the atoms in your assemble

01:11:28.260 --> 01:11:30.200
just the right
phase that they are

01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:32.840
coherent to emit
into the x-axis,

01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:36.270
they will also coherently emit
into a small, solid angle,

01:11:36.270 --> 01:11:38.190
and the solid angle is
given by this number.

01:11:40.980 --> 01:11:44.630
So the just of it is--
and I will not completely

01:11:44.630 --> 01:11:47.150
prove it to you, but I just
want to give you a taste--

01:11:47.150 --> 01:11:53.680
is that therefore, we still
have a superradiant enhancement.

01:11:53.680 --> 01:11:57.690
We know the superradiant
enhancement previously

01:11:57.690 --> 01:12:02.000
when we had the
localized system was n.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:06.520
But now we have the
n atoms act together,

01:12:06.520 --> 01:12:10.080
but they're not acting together
for emission into 4 pi.

01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:12.790
They are acting together for
emission into the solid angle.

01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:22.330
And if I write the
big n as density

01:12:22.330 --> 01:12:28.950
n times l times a squared,
the a squared cancels out

01:12:28.950 --> 01:12:32.280
and I get n lambda square l.

01:12:32.280 --> 01:12:36.800
And if you remember that
the cross section of an atom

01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:39.410
was lambda square
for absorption,

01:12:39.410 --> 01:12:42.410
if the atom is excited,
the cross section

01:12:42.410 --> 01:12:48.100
for amplification of light
for stimulated emission

01:12:48.100 --> 01:12:50.040
is also lambda squared.

01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:53.065
So lambda squared is
the gain cross section.

01:12:56.110 --> 01:13:00.050
And what we find now as a
superradiant enhancement factor

01:13:00.050 --> 01:13:02.830
is nothing else like
something which reminds us

01:13:02.830 --> 01:13:06.370
of a laser, which reminds
us of optical gain.

01:13:06.370 --> 01:13:08.870
And actually, the
lasing phenomenon

01:13:08.870 --> 01:13:13.490
in superradiance in extended
samples has a lot of analogies.

01:13:13.490 --> 01:13:15.982
In some limits,
it's even identical.

01:13:15.982 --> 01:13:17.940
When we are talking about
spontaneous emission,

01:13:17.940 --> 01:13:19.814
we are not talking about
stimulated emission.

01:13:19.814 --> 01:13:23.270
But if you have a system
which is in some excited state

01:13:23.270 --> 01:13:25.420
superradiant Dickey
states, and we

01:13:25.420 --> 01:13:28.040
are asking what are the
spontaneously emitted

01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:33.430
photons coming out,
to say different atoms

01:13:33.430 --> 01:13:35.700
emit into the same
mode, and now you

01:13:35.700 --> 01:13:38.880
have to add up the
feeds coherently,

01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:40.890
this is a language
we have used so far.

01:13:40.890 --> 01:13:45.030
Or if you use a language atom
emits a photon and this photon

01:13:45.030 --> 01:13:50.920
gets amplified on its way out,
those two language strongly

01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:53.460
overlap or in some limits
are even identical.

01:13:53.460 --> 01:13:57.020
So the amplification
of a photon on its way

01:13:57.020 --> 01:14:01.590
out, this is behind
superradiance.

01:14:01.590 --> 01:14:05.440
But when the localize the atoms
to lessen the wavelengths,

01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:08.240
well, the atoms pretty
much emit as a whole

01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:12.070
and there is no pass
lengths of the size

01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:14.420
of the optical wavelengths
where you can say the photon

01:14:14.420 --> 01:14:16.030
propagates, gets amplified.

01:14:16.030 --> 01:14:18.560
So we have looked at just
what comes out of it.

01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:20.550
But in extended
sample, you could even

01:14:20.550 --> 01:14:22.200
address this situation.

01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:25.830
How do the photons get
amplified, magnified,

01:14:25.830 --> 01:14:30.590
augmented when they travel
from the center to the edge?

01:14:30.590 --> 01:14:33.010
So you could actually ask,
what is the light intensity

01:14:33.010 --> 01:14:35.400
as a function of the
position within the cigar?

01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:39.070
For localized
samples, you can't.

01:14:39.070 --> 01:14:40.730
So let me just write that down.

01:14:40.730 --> 01:15:04.410
So this is analogous to
optical amplification

01:15:04.410 --> 01:15:06.620
in an elongated,
inverted medium.

01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:19.300
OK.

01:15:19.300 --> 01:15:33.340
So you can formally
describe that.

01:15:33.340 --> 01:15:45.150
You can now define new
Dickey states with respect

01:15:45.150 --> 01:15:50.800
to the preferred mode.

01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:54.930
And the preferred mode is
the mode in the x direction.

01:15:54.930 --> 01:15:59.060
So what I've done is--
remember, we have those atoms.

01:15:59.060 --> 01:16:04.640
Those atoms are now sitting at
different positions, x1 and x2.

01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:07.220
And if I define
Dickey states which

01:16:07.220 --> 01:16:10.510
have phase factors
into the ik x1,

01:16:10.510 --> 01:16:16.710
into the ik x2, if now
this atom emits a photon

01:16:16.710 --> 01:16:19.530
and this atom emits
a photon, well,

01:16:19.530 --> 01:16:24.250
the second photon is x2
minus x1 ahead of this photon

01:16:24.250 --> 01:16:29.600
if you think of those atoms
sitting aligned in a string.

01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:34.950
But the phase vector is exactly
canceling the propagation phase

01:16:34.950 --> 01:16:38.380
for the first atom in such
a way that if you are now

01:16:38.380 --> 01:16:41.870
coupling these states to
the electromagnetic field,

01:16:41.870 --> 01:16:44.370
the phase factors of the
electromagnetic field

01:16:44.370 --> 01:16:47.330
in the mode cancel with
those phase factors,

01:16:47.330 --> 01:16:52.940
and you again have the
situation that each state here

01:16:52.940 --> 01:16:55.890
has an equal amplitude
for emission.

01:16:55.890 --> 01:16:59.000
So now you have n
possible contributions,

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.460
and the normalization
is 1 over square root n,

01:17:01.460 --> 01:17:03.070
and everything falls into place.

01:17:05.620 --> 01:17:08.950
And you can define that for two
excited atoms with two phase

01:17:08.950 --> 01:17:10.120
factors and so on.

01:17:10.120 --> 01:17:14.610
So you can use immediately
the same formalism.

01:17:17.250 --> 01:17:47.420
And what happens is those phase
factors for the interaction

01:17:47.420 --> 01:17:55.290
Hamiltonian-- and
our interaction

01:17:55.290 --> 01:17:57.250
Hamiltonian is now different.

01:17:57.250 --> 01:18:00.420
It is di.

01:18:00.420 --> 01:18:02.940
And now in an
extended sample, we

01:18:02.940 --> 01:18:06.430
have to keep track of the
precision of the atom.

01:18:09.060 --> 01:18:14.380
So for the coupling to the
mode in the x direction,

01:18:14.380 --> 01:18:17.820
we have those phase factors.

01:18:28.060 --> 01:18:31.275
So all the phase factors cancel.

01:18:31.275 --> 01:18:32.650
And actually, I'm
not telling you

01:18:32.650 --> 01:18:36.360
whether this is plus or
minus in order to cancel.

01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:38.260
You pick the sign
that they all cancel,

01:18:38.260 --> 01:18:41.560
and then you have superradiance.

01:18:41.560 --> 01:18:43.560
You have fully
constructive interference.

01:19:05.010 --> 01:19:07.790
Yes.

01:19:07.790 --> 01:19:11.670
So all this looks now the
same as superradiance,

01:19:11.670 --> 01:19:13.990
but there are also things
which are different,

01:19:13.990 --> 01:19:15.500
and this is the following.

01:19:15.500 --> 01:19:19.150
If the atom would emit now
photons, not in the preferred

01:19:19.150 --> 01:19:27.100
mode, then-- remember,
we had the Dickey ladder.

01:19:27.100 --> 01:19:30.420
We had the most superradiant
ladder, little bit

01:19:30.420 --> 01:19:32.660
less superradiant
ladder, and eventually we

01:19:32.660 --> 01:19:35.440
had the subradiant
ladder in order

01:19:35.440 --> 01:19:41.200
of smaller and smaller
total quantum number s.

01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:44.300
Emission in the preferred
mode stays in each letter,

01:19:44.300 --> 01:19:46.590
and we have the
superradiant cascade.

01:19:46.590 --> 01:19:49.530
But emission into
other modes is now

01:19:49.530 --> 01:19:52.260
coupling different s states.

01:19:52.260 --> 01:19:57.000
Because the operator or the
phase factor into the IKR

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.530
has broken to complete
permutation symmetry

01:19:59.530 --> 01:20:00.340
between the sides.

01:20:00.340 --> 01:20:01.780
We have changed the symmetry.

01:20:01.780 --> 01:20:03.980
We have not the
completely symmetric sum.

01:20:03.980 --> 01:20:06.440
We have a symmetric
summation with phase factors.

01:20:06.440 --> 01:20:10.170
So therefore, the phenomenon
is somewhat different.

01:20:10.170 --> 01:20:14.730
But we still have superradiant
cascade for the preferred mode.

01:20:19.100 --> 01:20:28.480
And the result is that
we have an enhancement

01:20:28.480 --> 01:20:31.610
for the most symmetric
for the superradiant

01:20:31.610 --> 01:20:35.570
states, which is given by that.

01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:41.950
And this is nothing else than
the resonant optical density

01:20:41.950 --> 01:20:45.010
of your center.

01:20:45.010 --> 01:20:49.030
So in experiments-- many of
them go on in [INAUDIBLE] lab,

01:20:49.030 --> 01:20:53.160
where he uses collective
spin and the storage

01:20:53.160 --> 01:20:56.830
of single photons in
n atoms, the figure

01:20:56.830 --> 01:21:00.790
of [INAUDIBLE] of his samples
is always the optical density,

01:21:00.790 --> 01:21:05.716
the number of atoms times lambda
squared times the lengths.

01:21:10.380 --> 01:21:14.370
Finally-- and sorry for
keeping you three more

01:21:14.370 --> 01:21:19.240
minutes-- the form
of superradiance

01:21:19.240 --> 01:21:22.935
which is very important
is Raman superradiance.

01:21:28.160 --> 01:21:30.070
We don't have an
excited state where

01:21:30.070 --> 01:21:34.390
we put a lot of excitations on,
because the excited state would

01:21:34.390 --> 01:21:36.160
be very short lived.

01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:47.020
So what we instead do is, we
have Rabi frequency omega 1.

01:21:47.020 --> 01:21:51.150
We have a large
[INAUDIBLE] delta.

01:21:51.150 --> 01:21:54.180
And then the
spontaneous emission

01:21:54.180 --> 01:21:57.460
with the coupling
constant g takes us down

01:21:57.460 --> 01:22:00.420
to the excited state.

01:22:00.420 --> 01:22:05.270
In the case that the Rabi
frequency is much, much smaller

01:22:05.270 --> 01:22:13.350
than delta, we can
eliminate the excited state

01:22:13.350 --> 01:22:15.010
from the description.

01:22:15.010 --> 01:22:18.540
And what we obtain
is now a system

01:22:18.540 --> 01:22:20.435
which has an excited state.

01:22:23.250 --> 01:22:27.470
The widths of this
excited state--

01:22:27.470 --> 01:22:34.330
this is pretty much the virtual
state here-- is the scattering

01:22:34.330 --> 01:22:40.200
rate which is the probability
to excite the atom

01:22:40.200 --> 01:22:42.650
is Rabi frequencied
over detuning squared.

01:22:42.650 --> 01:22:44.550
That's just perturbation theory.

01:22:44.550 --> 01:22:49.120
And then we multiply with
gamma or gamma over 2.

01:22:49.120 --> 01:22:51.300
So this is the rate of
spontaneous emission out

01:22:51.300 --> 01:22:54.750
of the virtual state.

01:22:54.750 --> 01:23:02.250
And from this virtual state,
we go now to the ground state.

01:23:02.250 --> 01:23:06.210
And the Rabi frequency,
or the coupling

01:23:06.210 --> 01:23:09.550
for this virtual state,
is the original coupling

01:23:09.550 --> 01:23:12.140
g between ground
and excited state,

01:23:12.140 --> 01:23:15.100
but now pro-rated
by the amplitude

01:23:15.100 --> 01:23:19.741
that we have mixed the excited
state into the virtual state.

01:23:23.220 --> 01:23:28.980
So therefore, we have now
obtained a superradiant system.

01:23:28.980 --> 01:23:31.690
And for instance,
we did experiments

01:23:31.690 --> 01:23:34.540
which became classic now
because they are conceptually so

01:23:34.540 --> 01:23:37.210
clear-- we took a
Bose-Einstein condensate,

01:23:37.210 --> 01:23:40.760
we switched on one strong
of resonant laser beam,

01:23:40.760 --> 01:23:44.070
and then we had a system
which was 100% inverted,

01:23:44.070 --> 01:23:47.320
because we had no atoms
into the final state.

01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:49.910
The final state is a
Bose-Einstein condensate

01:23:49.910 --> 01:23:51.999
but with a recoil kick.

01:23:51.999 --> 01:23:53.915
So by just having a
Bose-Einstein condensation

01:23:53.915 --> 01:23:58.250
and shining this laser light on
it, we had now in this picture

01:23:58.250 --> 01:24:03.950
a 100% inverted system, which
is the ideal realization

01:24:03.950 --> 01:24:06.310
of a fully inverted Dicky state.

01:24:06.310 --> 01:24:08.300
Everything is
completely symmetric,

01:24:08.300 --> 01:24:11.255
and then we observed
superradiant emission

01:24:11.255 --> 01:24:12.380
of light pulses.

01:24:16.420 --> 01:24:16.920
OK.

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:24.370
So this has been the
important realize--

01:24:24.370 --> 01:24:30.380
so important experiments have
been done via BECs in my group

01:24:30.380 --> 01:24:36.350
and with cold atoms in
with laser code samples

01:24:36.350 --> 01:24:37.045
in [INAUDIBLE].

01:24:45.070 --> 01:24:48.110
So why is superradiance
so important?

01:24:48.110 --> 01:24:54.220
And this my last
statement for this class

01:24:54.220 --> 01:24:55.970
and for the semester.

01:24:55.970 --> 01:25:02.990
So if you have extended
sample superradiance,

01:25:02.990 --> 01:25:06.570
those samples are
no longer coupling

01:25:06.570 --> 01:25:10.940
to the electromagnetic field
with the coupling constant g.

01:25:10.940 --> 01:25:15.050
The coupling constant
g is now multiplied

01:25:15.050 --> 01:25:19.130
by the optical density
of your sample.

01:25:19.130 --> 01:25:24.850
And there is a lot of
interest for current research

01:25:24.850 --> 01:25:28.000
for quantum computation,
manipulation of photon states,

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:31.810
and all that, to do cavity QED.

01:25:31.810 --> 01:25:35.450
And in cavity QED,
we try to have

01:25:35.450 --> 01:25:38.220
very good mirrors,
very small mode volume

01:25:38.220 --> 01:25:39.845
to have a very, very large g.

01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:47.720
But this large g which
we achieve in a cavity,

01:25:47.720 --> 01:25:51.540
if you put many
atoms in it, gets

01:25:51.540 --> 01:25:53.730
enhanced by the optical density.

01:25:53.730 --> 01:25:57.790
So the cavity enhancement and
the superradiant enhancement

01:25:57.790 --> 01:25:59.360
is multiplicative.

01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:03.110
And often, it's very favorable
for single photon manipulation

01:26:03.110 --> 01:26:03.930
if you do Bose.

01:26:03.930 --> 01:26:08.750
You getting enhancement form
the cavity and enhancement

01:26:08.750 --> 01:26:10.180
due to superradiance.

01:26:10.180 --> 01:26:12.810
And the person who has
really pioneered work

01:26:12.810 --> 01:26:17.370
along this direction is
[INAUDIBLE] here at MIT.

01:26:17.370 --> 01:26:20.020
Anyway, yes, with
five minutes delay,

01:26:20.020 --> 01:26:21.740
I finish the chapter
on superradiance.

01:26:24.700 --> 01:26:26.420
Well, that's the
end of this course.

01:26:26.420 --> 01:26:30.250
Let me thank you for your
active participation.

01:26:30.250 --> 01:26:33.410
Sometimes as a lecturer, you
learn as much as the students.

01:26:33.410 --> 01:26:36.570
And I think partially based on
your questions and discussions,

01:26:36.570 --> 01:26:37.640
this is really true.

01:26:37.640 --> 01:26:40.020
I've learned a few new
aspects of atomic physics.

01:26:40.020 --> 01:26:41.660
I hope you have
learned something, too.

01:26:41.660 --> 01:26:44.710
And good luck in the future.
