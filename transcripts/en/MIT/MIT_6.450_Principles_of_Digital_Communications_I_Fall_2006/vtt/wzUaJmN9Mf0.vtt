00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.390
PROFESSOR: I want to start out
today by reviewing what we

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.330
covered last time.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.370
We sort of covered two lectures
of material, but a

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.120
little bit lightly last time
because I want to spend more

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:43.470
time starting today dealing with
wave forms and functions.

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.340
We will get notes on that
very, very shortly.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.400
To review quantization, we
started out by talking about

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.860
scalar quantizers, in other
words, the thing that we want

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.820
to do is to take a sequence of
real numbers and each of those

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.930
real numbers we want to
quantizers it into one of a

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.180
finite set of symbols.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.100
Then, of course, the symbols
we're going to

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.770
encode later on.

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.820
So basically what we're doing is
we're taking the real line,

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:29.350
we're splitting it into a bunch
of regions, r1, r2, r3.

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.870
The last region of the
first region goes

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:33.690
off to minus infinity.

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.330
The last region goes off
to plus infinity.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.590
So that clearly, if there's a
lot of probability over in

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.170
here or a lot of probably over
in here, you're going to have

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.430
a very large distortion.

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.880
So, when we talk more about that
later and talk about how

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.430
to avoid it and why we
should avoid it and

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.780
all of these things.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.240
We then talked about these
Lloyd-Max conditions for

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.380
minimum mean square error.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.180
What we said last time was
suppose somebody gives you

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:12.060
these representation points,
which you're going to use to

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:18.300
represent the actual number on
the real line that comes out.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.520
Then you ask when some
particular number occurs

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:28.250
should we encode it into this
point or into this point?

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.230
If our criterion is mean square
error, and that's what

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.100
our criterion is normally going
to be, then we're going

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.470
to minimize the mean square
error for this particular

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.090
point by mapping it here, if
that's the most probable --

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.875
we're going to map it here if
this is the closest point, and

00:02:51.875 --> 00:02:54.780
we're going to map it here if
that's the closest point.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.280
Because by doing this we
minimize the squared error

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.850
between b and a1 or b and a2.

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.780
So, that says that we're going
to define these regions to

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:14.150
have the separations between
the regions at the bisector

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.470
points between the
representation points.

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.460
So that says that one of the
Lloyd-Max conditions for

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:23.810
minimum mean square error is you
always want to choose the

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.230
regions in such a way that
they're the mid-points between

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.880
the representation points.

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.750
Any minimum mean square error
quantizers has to satisfy this

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.370
condition for each of the j's.

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.200
Namely, for each of these
points they have to be

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.500
mid-points.

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.250
Then the other thing that we
observed is that once we

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.520
choose these regions, the way
we want to choose the

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:55.830
representation points to
minimize the mean square error

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.530
is we now have to look at the
probability density on this

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.090
real line and we have to choose
these points to be the

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.530
conditional means within the
representation area.

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.190
That just comes out by formula
to be the expected value of

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:18.480
the random variable u, which is
this value as it occurs on

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.820
the real line.

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:24.450
The expected value of that
conditional on being in region

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:31.850
rj is just the integral
of u times the

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:35.010
conditional density of u.

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:39.010
The conditional density of u
is the real density of u

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:43.080
divided by the probability
of being in that region.

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.530
So all of this is very simple.

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:49.430
I hope you see it as something
which is almost trivial,

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.270
because if you don't see it as
something simple, go back and

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:58.560
look at it because, in fact,
this is not rocket science

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.060
here, this is just what
you would normally do.

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.860
So Lloyd-Max algorithm then
says alternate between the

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:14.160
conditions for the mid-points
between the regions and the

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.300
conditional means.

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.800
The Lloyd-Max conditions are
necessary but not sufficient.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.910
In other words, any time you
find a minimum mean square

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:30.030
error quantization, it's going
to satisfy those conditions.

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:34.590
But if you find a set of points,
b sub j, and a set of

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.890
points, a sub j, which satisfy
those conditions, it doesn't

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:42.450
necessarily mean that
you have a minimum.

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:47.620
In other words, there are often
multiple sets of points

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:55.930
which satisfy the Lloyd-Max
conditions, and one or more of

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:58.610
those is going to be optimum,
is going to be the smallest

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:00.680
one, and the others are not
going to be optimum.

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:05.870
In other words, the algorithm
is a local hill-climbing

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:11.620
algorithm, which finds the best
thing it can find which

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.290
is close to where it's starting
at some very strange

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:16.810
sense of close.

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:21.190
The close is not any sense of
mean square error, but close

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:25.670
is defined in terms of where the
algorithm happens to go.

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:29.320
So an example of that that we
talked about last time is

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:32.470
where you have three spikes
of probability.

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:36.410
Two of them are smaller and
one of them is bigger.

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:40.510
One of them is at minus 1, one
of them is at zero, one of

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:43.100
them is at plus 1.

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:48.760
One solution to the Lloyd-Max
conditions is this one here

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:53.610
where a1 is sitting right in
the middle of the spike.

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:58.610
Therefore, any time that the
sample value of the random

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:04.860
variable is over here, you get
virtually no distortion.

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:11.170
The other point is sitting at
the conditional mean between

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:12.790
these two points.

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:15.190
So it's a little closer
to this one than it

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:16.030
is to this one --

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:19.570
I hope the figure shows that.

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:24.640
Any time you wind up here or
here, you get this amount of

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:26.390
the distortion.

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:29.390
Now without making any
calculations you just look at

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:32.470
this and you say well,
this spike is bigger

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:35.000
than this spike is.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.210
Therefore, it makes sense if
we're going to do this kind of

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:44.280
strategy to put a 2 underneath
that spike, therefore, getting

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:50.150
a very small distortion any
time the big spike occurs.

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:54.840
Then a1 is going to be midway
between these two points, and

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:57.880
you get the larger amount of
distortion there but now it's

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:00.510
a less probable event.

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:04.180
So you can easily check that
both of these solutions

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:09.010
satisfy the Lloyd-Max
conditions, but one of them

00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:12.580
turns out to be optimal and the
other one turns out to be

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:14.550
not optimal.

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:17.340
If you fiddle around with it
for a while, you can pretty

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:24.170
much convince yourself that
those are the only solutions

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:28.920
to the Lloyd-Max algorithm for
this particular problem.

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:29.650
Yeah?

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:32.860
AUDIENCE: When there's a
region that has zero

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:36.730
probability throughout, and the
Lloyd-Max algorithm tries

00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:40.300
to find the mean for that
region, it's going to find

00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:44.302
somewhere outside the region,
it will find zero as the

00:08:44.302 --> 00:08:46.950
expected value.

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:49.783
But that might not necessarily
be inside that region, what

00:08:49.783 --> 00:08:51.850
does it do in that case?

00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:53.190
PROFESSOR: What does
it do in that case?

00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:57.700
Well, I don't think you
can argue that it's

00:08:57.700 --> 00:08:58.990
going to be at zero.

00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:01.940
I think you have to argue that
it might be anywhere that it

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:03.680
wants to be.

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:06.290
Therefore, what the algorithm is
going to do when you start

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:09.300
with a certain set of
representation points --

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:16.120
well, if you start with a
certain set of representation

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:18.470
points that picks that separater
wherever it happens

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:21.770
to be, than this particular
point you're talking about is

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:27.390
going to be at some completely
unimportant place.

00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:31.140
You know eventually the thing
that's going to happen is that

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:35.430
this thing that's in a region of
no probability is going to

00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:37.600
spread out and include something
that has some

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:41.580
probability, and then you're
going to nail that region with

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:44.160
some probability.

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:46.750
I can't prove this to you, and
I'm not even sure that it's

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:51.780
always true, but I think if you
try a couple of examples

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:53.880
you will see that it sort
of does the right thing.

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:57.640
AUDIENCE: But in the algorithm,
you replace the

00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:02.390
point at the point of expected
value in that region.

00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:05.840
So, the algorithm doesn't know
what to do at that point.

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:08.100
It crashes.

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:11.780
PROFESSOR: Well, unless you're
smart enough to write the

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:14.900
program to do something
sensible, yes.

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:15.120
AUDIENCE:
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:17.300
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:19.200
And you have to write
it so it'll do

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.190
something reasonable then.

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:24.340
The best thing to do is to start
out without having any

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:27.400
of the regions have
zero probability.

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:28.650
AUDIENCE: We have that
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:33.530
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:36.040
Well then you have to use
some common sense on it.

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:57.060
So, after that we say OK, well
just like when we were dealing

00:10:57.060 --> 00:11:01.230
with discrete source coding,
any time we finish talking

00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:04.050
about encoding a single letter,
we talk about what

00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:05.610
happens when you
encode multiple

00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:08.250
letters in the same way.

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:15.320
Somebody is bound to think of
the idea of encoding multiple

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:16.870
real numbers all together.

00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:18.900
So they're going to think of
the idea of taking this

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:23.820
sequence of real numbers,
segmenting it into blocks of n

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:30.120
numbers each and then taking
the set of n numbers and

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:33.620
trying to find a reasonable
quantization for that.

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:36.060
In that case, the quantization
points are

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:38.320
going to be n vectors.

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.770
The regions are going
to be regions in

00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:42.470
n dimensional space.

00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:47.330
Well, if you think about it
a little bit, these n

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:51.740
dimensional representation
points, if you're given them,

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:56.100
the place where you're going to
establish the regions then

00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:58.550
is on the perpendicular
bisectors

00:11:58.550 --> 00:12:00.220
between any two points.

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:02.900
Namely, for each two points
you're going to establish a

00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:06.400
perpendicular bisector between
those two points, you're going

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:08.470
to do that for all
sets of points.

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:12.630
You're going to take regions
which are enclosed by all of

00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:15.900
those perpendicular bisectors,
and you call

00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:17.420
those the voronoi region.

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:21.750
Remember, I drew an example of
it last time that looked

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:26.070
something like this.

00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:29.290
You have various
points around.

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:32.800
It's hard to draw it in more
than two dimensions.

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:35.520
So these perpendicular
bisectors go

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:47.760
like this and so forth.

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:51.850
I think you can show that you've
never had the situation

00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:58.230
-- interesting problem if you
want to play with it.

00:12:58.230 --> 00:13:01.560
I don't think you can have that,
but I'm not sure why.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.250
Anyway, you do have these
voronoi regions.

00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:11.150
You have these perpendicular
bisectors that you set up in

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:15.850
two dimensional space or in
high dimensional space.

00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:19.650
Then given those regions
you can then establish

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:23.720
representation points, which are
at the conditional means

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:26.150
within those regions.

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:29.270
You really have the same problem
that you had before,

00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:32.180
it's just a much grubbier
problem because it's using

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:34.880
vectors, it's an n dimensional
space.

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:38.290
For this reason this problem
was enormously popular for

00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:41.580
many, many years, because
many people loved the

00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:42.750
complexity of it.

00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:44.690
It was really neat
to write computer

00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:46.820
programs that did this.

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:50.210
Back in those days you had to
be careful about computer

00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:55.440
programs because computation
was very, very slow, and it

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:57.960
was a lot of fun.

00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:01.550
When you get all done with it,
you don't gain much by doing

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:03.410
any of that.

00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:09.350
The one thing that you do gain
is that if you take square

00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:12.490
regions, namely, if you take a
whole bunch of points which

00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:17.910
are laid out on a rectangular
grid and you take regions

00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:21.950
which are now little rectangles
or little squares,

00:14:21.950 --> 00:14:25.270
and you look at them for a
while, you say that's not a

00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:27.780
very good thing to do.

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:31.370
A better thing to do is to take
all this two dimensional

00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:35.190
space, for example, and to fill
it in to tile it we say

00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:41.350
with hexagons as opposed to
tiling it with rectangles or

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:43.230
to tiling it with squares.

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:49.360
If you tile it with hexagons,
for given amount of area you

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:52.150
get a smaller mean
square error.

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:55.150
If you could tile it with
circles that would be the best

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:58.610
of all, but when you try to tile
it with circles you find

00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:01.910
out there's all this stuff left
in the middle, like if

00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:05.440
you've ever tried to tile a
floor with circles you find

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:07.280
out you have to fill it
in somehow and it's

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:09.260
a little bit awkward.

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:12.180
So hexagons work,
circles don't.

00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:16.610
If you then go on to a higher
number of dimensions, you get

00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:20.020
the same sort of thing
happening, you get these nice

00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:23.130
n dimensional shapes
which will tile

00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:25.350
n dimensional volume.

00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:32.160
As n gets larger and larger,
these tiling volumes become

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:36.310
closer and closer to spheres,
and you can prove all sorts of

00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:37.970
theorems about that.

00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:40.980
But the trouble is when you
get all done you haven't

00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:44.770
gained very much, except you
have a much more complex

00:15:44.770 --> 00:15:46.220
problem to solve.

00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:49.210
But you don't have a much
smaller mean square

00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:50.480
distortion.

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:53.320
So you can still
use Lloyd-Max.

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:57.410
Lloyd-Max still has as many
problems as it had before in

00:15:57.410 --> 00:15:59.460
finding local minima.

00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:01.610
With a little bit of thought
about it you can see it's

00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:03.750
going to have a lot
more problems.

00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:08.770
Because visualize starting
Lloyd-Max out where your

00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:13.940
points are on a square grid and
where your regions now are

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:15.143
a little square.

00:16:15.143 --> 00:16:17.720
So in other words, like this.

00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:30.670
Try to think of how the
algorithm is going to go from

00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:35.980
that to the hexagons that
you would rather have.

00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:39.850
You can see pretty easily that
it's very unlikely that the

00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:43.530
algorithm was ever going to
find its way to hexagons,

00:16:43.530 --> 00:16:46.780
which by looking at it a little
further away we can see

00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:49.350
it's clearly a good
thing to do.

00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:51.910
In other words, Lloyd-Max
algorithm

00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:54.020
doesn't have any vision.

00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:56.980
It can't see beyond
its own nose.

00:16:56.980 --> 00:17:01.710
It just takes these points and
looks for regions determined

00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:05.320
by neighboring points, but it
doesn't have the sense to look

00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:07.980
for what kind of structure
you want.

00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:14.700
So anyway, Lloyd-Max becomes
worse and worse in those

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:20.910
situations and the problem
gets uglier and uglier.

00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:24.680
Then, as we said last time, we
stop and think and we said

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:28.660
well gee, we weren't solving
the right problem anyway.

00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:32.580
As often happens when a problem
gets very popular,

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:36.400
people start out properly by
saying well I don't know how

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:38.550
to solve the real problem
so I'll try

00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:41.210
to solve a toy problem.

00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:45.370
Then somehow the toy problem
gets a life of its own because

00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:48.830
people write many papers about
it and students think since

00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:50.850
there are many papers
about it, it must be

00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:53.340
an important problem.

00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:55.820
Then since there are these open
problems, students can

00:17:55.820 --> 00:18:00.580
solve those open problems and
get PhD theses, and then they

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:04.840
got a in a university, and the
easiest thing for them to do

00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:08.700
is to get 10 students working on
the same class of problems

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:11.010
and you see what happens.

00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:13.710
I'm not criticizing the students
who do that or the

00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:16.540
faculty members who do it,
they're all trapped in this

00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:19.020
kind of crazy system.

00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:24.380
Anyway, the right problem that
we should have started with is

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:29.290
when we look at the problem of
quantization followed by

00:18:29.290 --> 00:18:33.140
discrete source coding, we
should have said that what

00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:37.290
we're interested in is not the
number of quantization levels,

00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:41.540
but rather the entropy of the
set of quantization levels.

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:44.460
That's the important thing
because that's the thing that

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:48.220
determines how many bits we're
going to need to encode these

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:50.720
symbols that come out
of the quantizer.

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:53.850
So the problem we'd like to
solve is to find the minimum

00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:58.560
mean square error quantizer
for a given representation

00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:00.370
point entropy.

00:19:00.370 --> 00:19:03.340
In other words, whatever set of
points you have, you want

00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:06.000
to minimize the entropy
of that set of points.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.700
What that's going to do is to
give you a larger set of

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:12.630
points, but some points with
a very small probability.

00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:16.370
Therefore, those points with a
very small probability are not

00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:18.400
going to happen very often.

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:21.470
Therefore, they don't affect
the entropy very much, and

00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:24.160
therefore, you get a lot of gain
in terms of mean square

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:27.400
error by using these very
improbable points.

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:33.430
That's a very nasty
problem to solve.

00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:36.410
And again, we said well
let's try to solve a

00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:39.640
simpler version of it.

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:42.830
A simpler version of it is first
to go back to the one

00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:47.290
dimensional case and then say
OK, what happens if we just

00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:50.860
use a uniform quantizer, because
that's what most

00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:54.390
people use in practice anyway.

00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:58.430
If we use a uniform quantizer
and we talk about a high rate

00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:00.930
uniform quantizer, in other
words, we make the

00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:03.940
quantization points close
together, what's going to

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:05.940
happen in that case?

00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:10.740
Well, the probability of each
quantization region in that

00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:18.630
case is going to be close to the
size of the representation

00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:21.500
interval, in other words, of
the quantization interval,

00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:25.530
times the probability density
within that interval.

00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:29.290
Namely, if we have a probability
density and that

00:20:29.290 --> 00:20:33.650
probability density is smooth,
then if you take very, very

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:37.460
small intervals you're going to
have a probability density

00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:40.570
that doesn't change much
within that interval.

00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:43.440
Therefore, the probability of
the interval is just going to

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:46.470
be the size of that quantization
interval -- in a

00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:50.270
uniform quantizer you'll make
all of the intervals the same

00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:53.710
-- times the density within
that integral.

00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:57.180
Then we say OK, let's look at
what the entropy is of that

00:20:57.180 --> 00:21:00.740
set of points, of the set of
points where the probabilities

00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:05.180
are chosen to be some small
delta times the probability

00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:06.360
density there.

00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:09.390
I'm going through a slightly
simpler kind of argument today

00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:13.330
than I did last time, and I'll
explain why I'm doing

00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:15.720
something simpler today and
why I did something more

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:16.970
complicated then.

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:23.510
So this entropy is
this quantity.

00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:28.640
If we now substitute delta times
the density for pj here,

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:33.490
we get the sum over j of this
delta pj, which is the

00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:38.780
probability density times the
logarithm of delta pj.

00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:43.010
Well now look, the logarithm of
delta pj is just logarithm

00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:47.010
of delta plus logarithm of pj.

00:21:47.010 --> 00:21:50.670
So we're taking the sum over all
the probability space of

00:21:50.670 --> 00:21:52.200
logarithm of delta.

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:53.680
That comes out.

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:57.890
So we get a minus log delta, and
what's left is minus the

00:21:57.890 --> 00:22:01.920
sum of delta pj log pj.

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:04.350
Does that look like something?

00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:09.760
That looks exactly like the
approximation to an integral

00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:11.160
that you always talk about.

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:15.030
Namely, if you look at a
Reimann integral, the

00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:18.950
fundamental way to define a
Reimann integral is in terms

00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:22.420
of splitting up that integral
into lots of little

00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:26.960
increments, taking the value of
the function in each one of

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:30.000
those increments, multiplying
it by the size of the

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.330
increments and adding
them all up.

00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:35.290
In fact, we're going to do that
a little later today when

00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:38.840
I try to explain to you what
the difference is between

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:41.360
Reimann integration and
Lebesgue integration.

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:46.200
should Don't be frightened
if you've never taken any

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:49.990
mathematics courses, because
if people had taught you

00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:54.900
Lebesgue integration when you
were freshmen at MIT or

00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:57.300
seniors in high school or
whenever you learned about

00:22:57.300 --> 00:23:00.240
integration, it would have
been just as simple as

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:02.240
teaching about Reimann
integration.

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:06.530
One is no simpler and no more
complicated than the other, so

00:23:06.530 --> 00:23:09.070
we're really going back to study
something you should

00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:12.910
have learned about five
years ago, maybe.

00:23:12.910 --> 00:23:18.020
So anyway, when we represent
this as an integral, we get

00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:20.930
this thing called the
differential entropy, which is

00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:26.810
the integral of p of u minus
p of u times log of p of u.

00:23:26.810 --> 00:23:31.730
So the entropy of the discrete
representation is minus log

00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:36.070
delta plus this differential
entropy.

00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:40.960
The mean square error in this
uniform quantizer, the

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:44.400
conditional means according to
this approximation are right

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:46.960
in the middle of
the intervals.

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:50.630
So we have a uniform probability
interval of width

00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:54.480
delta, a point right in the
middle of it, and even I can

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:58.370
integrate that to find the mean
square error in it, which

00:23:58.370 --> 00:24:01.920
is delta squared over 12, which
I think you've done at

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:03.620
least once in the
homework by now.

00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:13.390
So I said I was going to tell
you why I went through doing

00:24:13.390 --> 00:24:16.940
it this simpler way this time
and put in a lot more

00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:19.570
notation last time.

00:24:19.570 --> 00:24:22.160
If you really try to trace
through what the

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:26.580
approximations are here, the
way we did it last time is

00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:29.490
much, much better, because then
you can trace through

00:24:29.490 --> 00:24:32.520
what's happening in those
approximations, and you can

00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:34.840
see, as delta goes to zero,
what's happened.

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:35.230
Yes?

00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:39.972
AUDIENCE: This may be an obvious
question, why did you

00:24:39.972 --> 00:24:43.008
substitute delta with pj
[INAUDIBLE PHRASE]?

00:24:46.550 --> 00:24:48.830
PROFESSOR: Oh, why did I--?

00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:54.260
OK, this is the probability of
the representation of the j's

00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:56.010
representation point.

00:24:56.010 --> 00:24:59.790
This is the probability
density around that

00:24:59.790 --> 00:25:01.680
representation point.

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:05.230
The assumption I'm making here
is that f of u was constant

00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:08.210
over that interval.

00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:11.500
And if the density is constant
over the interval, if I have a

00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:16.990
density which is constant over
an interval of width delta,

00:25:16.990 --> 00:25:20.280
than the probability of landing
in that interval is

00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:21.750
the width times the height.

00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:24.177
AUDIENCE: I think there's
a typo in your

00:25:24.177 --> 00:25:26.120
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:26.560
PROFESSOR: A typo?

00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:27.810
AUDIENCE:
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:46.290
PROFESSOR: Yes, yes, yes.

00:25:46.290 --> 00:25:48.440
I'm sorry, yes.

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:51.070
I'm blind today.

00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:54.520
I knew what I meant so
well that I didn't --

00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:56.250
thank you.

00:25:56.250 --> 00:25:59.320
s of uj.

00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:02.350
s of uj.

00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:04.260
Yes.

00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:09.240
Then I take out the delta and
what I'm left with is the

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:18.980
delta f of uj times the
log of f of uj.

00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:21.590
Thank you.

00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:25.520
When I look at that it's delta
times the probability density

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:29.310
times the log of the probability
density.

00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:32.480
If I convert that now into an
interval when delta is very

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:36.200
small, I get this thing called
the differential entropy.

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:39.610
Does that make a little
more sense?

00:26:39.610 --> 00:26:41.590
So your question was obvious,
it was just that

00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:42.840
I was a total dummy.

00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:53.060
So let's summarize what
all of that says.

00:26:56.260 --> 00:26:59.210
In the scalar case
we're saying --

00:26:59.210 --> 00:27:02.200
I have said but I have
not shown --

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:06.370
that a uniform scalar quantizer
approaches an

00:27:06.370 --> 00:27:09.010
optimal scaler quantizer.

00:27:09.010 --> 00:27:12.900
I haven't explained it all
in class why that's true.

00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:15.490
There's an argument in the
notes that points it out.

00:27:15.490 --> 00:27:17.630
You can read that there.

00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:27.330
It's just another optimization,
but it's true if

00:27:27.330 --> 00:27:30.500
you're looking at a higher
and higher rate, a scaler

00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:35.270
quantizer where delta gets
smaller and smaller, then in

00:27:35.270 --> 00:27:38.280
general what you need is to take
a different size delta

00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:41.700
for each quantization region and
then look at what happens

00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:45.530
when you try to optimize over
that and you find out that you

00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:48.520
want to make all of the
deltas the same.

00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:53.080
The required number of encoded
bits per symbol depends only

00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:57.850
on h of u and on delta.

00:27:57.850 --> 00:28:00.190
This is the most important
part of all of this.

00:28:00.190 --> 00:28:04.900
It says that as you change this
differential entropy, if

00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:08.580
you try to draw a curve between
H of v and MSE, and

00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:12.140
there's a curve like that drawn
in the notes, if you

00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:15.110
change the differential entropy,
it just shift this

00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:16.980
curve left and right.

00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:22.780
For a given value of h of u,
this is a universal curve.

00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:26.190
In other words, as you change
delta, this quantity changes

00:28:26.190 --> 00:28:29.760
and this quantity changes.

00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:33.990
That's the only variable which
is left in here at this point.

00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:37.540
When you make delta half as
big, if you want to get a

00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:40.920
higher rate quantizer,
what happens?

00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:45.090
Your mean square error goes
down by a factor of four.

00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:50.610
Delta squared goes down to 1/4
of its previous value.

00:28:50.610 --> 00:28:53.420
What happens here,
at log of delta?

00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:56.500
Delta has changed by
a factor of 1/2.

00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:59.430
H of v goes up by one bit.

00:28:59.430 --> 00:29:02.740
So you take one more bit in your
quantizer and you get a

00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:06.610
mean square error, which
is four times as small.

00:29:06.610 --> 00:29:09.550
Any time you think of what kind
of accuracy you need on a

00:29:09.550 --> 00:29:14.220
computer or something, I think
this is obvious to all of you,

00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:18.300
if you put it in terms of
something you're already

00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:20.240
familiar with.

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:27.530
If you use 16 bit quantization
with fixed bit numbers and

00:29:27.530 --> 00:29:30.660
then you change it to
24 bit accuracy,

00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:32.310
what's going to happen?

00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:36.700
Well, everything is going to get
better by a factor of 256,

00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:39.530
and since we're talking about
mean square error, it's going

00:29:39.530 --> 00:29:40.680
to be four times that.

00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:45.440
So that's just saying the same
thing that you know.

00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:50.100
For vector quantization, uniform
quantization again

00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:53.150
approaches optimal for
a memoryless source.

00:29:53.150 --> 00:29:56.130
If you have a source with
memory, vector quantization

00:29:56.130 --> 00:29:57.860
gains a great deal for you.

00:29:57.860 --> 00:30:01.540
But if you don't have any
memory, vector quantization

00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:03.250
doesn't gain much at all.

00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:06.650
The only thing that vector
quantization gains you is this

00:30:06.650 --> 00:30:09.300
thing we call a shaping
gain now.

00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:14.700
We talk about that again when
we start talking about

00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:16.520
modulation.

00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:20.660
If you change from a square set
of points to a hexagonal

00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:26.420
set of points and you keep the
areas the same, the mean

00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:30.170
square error goes down
by a smidgen --

00:30:30.170 --> 00:30:32.680
something like 1.04
or something.

00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:36.230
It's not a big deal but there's
some gain, so the gain

00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:39.390
is not impressive.

00:30:39.390 --> 00:30:41.830
The big gains come when you look
at the memory and when

00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:45.410
you take that into account.

00:30:45.410 --> 00:30:51.590
So now we want to get on to the
last part of our trilogy

00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:56.970
when we're talking about
source coding.

00:30:56.970 --> 00:31:00.215
Remember, when we were talking
about source coding, we broke

00:31:00.215 --> 00:31:02.490
it up into three pieces.

00:31:02.490 --> 00:31:06.660
The first piece we called it
sampling, which took a wave

00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:10.140
form, turned it into a
sequence of numbers.

00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:11.950
That's what happens here.

00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:16.540
We then quantize the sequence of
numbers, either one number

00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:20.420
at a time or with a vector
quantizer n numbers at a time.

00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:23.960
We just finished talking
about that.

00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:27.700
The first five lectures in the
course were all talking about

00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:30.570
discrete encoding, and whenever
you're going from

00:31:30.570 --> 00:31:35.820
wave forms to bits, you gotta go
through all three of these.

00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:39.280
Now, sampling is only one way
to go from wave form to

00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:42.940
sequence, and filtering is
only one way to get back.

00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:45.320
We're going to talk
about sampling.

00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:48.340
We're probably going to teach
you more about sampling than

00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:50.790
you ever wanted to know.

00:31:50.790 --> 00:31:54.680
But it turns out that
it's worth knowing.

00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:59.360
After you understand it
you never forget it.

00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:02.950
There's a lot of stuff to go
through to start with, but

00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:05.430
finally, I hope, it
all makes sense.

00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:07.620
But anyway, the thing we're
going to be talking about

00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:11.080
today is really the question
of how do you go from wave

00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:15.010
forms to sequences,
it's that simple.

00:32:15.010 --> 00:32:17.350
How do you in general
take wave forms,

00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:19.000
turn them into sequences?

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.240
How do you go back from
sequences to wave forms?

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:24.950
We're going to spend quite
a bit of time on this.

00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:31.570
We're going to spend three
lectures talking about it, and

00:32:31.570 --> 00:32:34.210
probably with today thrown in
it'll be closer to three and a

00:32:34.210 --> 00:32:36.230
half lectures.

00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:39.460
It's not only because we want to
talk about the problem with

00:32:39.460 --> 00:32:42.910
source coding, because as soon
as we start talking about

00:32:42.910 --> 00:32:47.490
channels, we're going to have
the same truck problem looked

00:32:47.490 --> 00:32:49.840
at in the opposite direction.

00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:52.680
We're going to start out
with binary data.

00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:54.940
We're then going to go through
a modulator, we're going to

00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:56.930
find symbols.

00:32:56.930 --> 00:33:00.240
From the symbols, from the
numerical symbols, we're

00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:03.890
talking about a sequence of
things and we have to go from

00:33:03.890 --> 00:33:07.080
the sequence to wave forms.

00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:10.370
So, both of those problems
are really the same.

00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:14.320
We're talking about it first in
terms of source coding, but

00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:18.430
whatever we learn about wave
forms to sequences will be

00:33:18.430 --> 00:33:20.450
general and will be
usable for both.

00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:26.610
So I want to review why it is
that we want to spend so much

00:33:26.610 --> 00:33:30.810
time on this analog source
to bit stream problem.

00:33:30.810 --> 00:33:34.260
I just told you one of the
reasons which is not here,

00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:37.000
which is that it's a good way
to get into the question of

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.750
what do we do with channels.

00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:42.300
But the other reasons, and we've
talked about them all,

00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:45.680
and they're all important and
you ought to remember them,

00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:48.600
because often we get so used to
doing things in a certain

00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:51.260
way that we don't know why
we're doing them and then

00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:54.060
somebody suggests something else
and we say oh, that's a

00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:58.790
terrible idea because we've
always done it this way.

00:33:58.790 --> 00:34:01.710
One of the reasons why we want
to go to bits is that a

00:34:01.710 --> 00:34:05.400
standard binary interface
separates the problem of

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:07.850
source and channel coding.

00:34:07.850 --> 00:34:13.160
This was, in a sense, one of
Shannon's great discoveries,

00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:15.290
and he also showed that
you could do it

00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:18.100
without really any loss.

00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:20.790
Another reason is you want
to multiplex data

00:34:20.790 --> 00:34:22.820
on high speed channels.

00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:25.590
This is perfectly
familiar to you.

00:34:25.590 --> 00:34:29.340
I think to everyone today we
think of sending data over the

00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:34.110
web and we're all used to using
the web all together.

00:34:34.110 --> 00:34:37.540
I send my stuff, you send your
stuff, I get my stuff off, you

00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:40.900
get your stuff off, and this
stuff was all going over

00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:41.850
common channels.

00:34:41.850 --> 00:34:46.530
It's going over optical fibers
into MIT, and then it splits

00:34:46.530 --> 00:34:49.850
up at MIT and goes into many
places and then it goes many

00:34:49.850 --> 00:34:51.080
places again.

00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:54.380
But this idea of multiplexing
data is perfectly

00:34:54.380 --> 00:34:55.320
straightforward.

00:34:55.320 --> 00:35:00.490
If we didn't do any of this, if
all of my stuff was really

00:35:00.490 --> 00:35:05.100
wave forms and all of your stuff
was images and if all of

00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:10.380
somebody else's stuff was data
and every piece of the

00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:14.070
internet had to worry about all
those different things,

00:35:14.070 --> 00:35:16.400
when you start worrying about
all those different things you

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:20.100
create an awful lot of
other things also.

00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:22.630
We just wouldn't have
any internet today.

00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:27.420
So this multiplexing
is a big deal, too.

00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:31.980
You can clean up digital data
at each link in a network.

00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:36.150
In other words, if I'm sending
analog data from here to San

00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:39.960
Francisco and I'm sending it
over multiple different links,

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:43.550
on every link a little bit of
noise gets added to it.

00:35:43.550 --> 00:35:45.970
That noise keeps adding up
because there's no way to

00:35:45.970 --> 00:35:49.410
clean it up, because nobody
knows what I sent.

00:35:49.410 --> 00:35:56.080
If I'm sending digital data, at
the receiver on each link,

00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:59.430
nobody knows what I sent, no,
but they know that what I sent

00:35:59.430 --> 00:36:02.810
was one out of a finite
collection of things.

00:36:02.810 --> 00:36:05.340
There's something called
repeating going on there at

00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:09.900
every channel, which takes what
is received as an analog

00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:15.370
signal and, in fact, knowing
what the encoding process was,

00:36:15.370 --> 00:36:19.790
goes back to cleaning it up
to a digital signal again.

00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:25.020
If you believe all of that
and if you think it's

00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:25.940
simple, it's not.

00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:28.620
We're going to talk
about it later.

00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:34.370
At this point, it's only
plausible, and we're going to

00:36:34.370 --> 00:36:38.090
justify it as we move on.

00:36:38.090 --> 00:36:41.880
We can separate problems of
wave form sampling from

00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:45.080
quantization from discrete
source coding.

00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:47.870
In other words, we not only
have the layering between

00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:51.980
sources and channels, but we
also have this layering for

00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:56.860
sources, which goes between
wave form to sequence

00:36:56.860 --> 00:37:02.910
separation, then sequence and
quantization into a finite set

00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:03.860
of symbols.

00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:06.620
Then a finite set of symbols
getting coded.

00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:09.430
So, three separate things we've
learned about, we can

00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:11.340
separate them all very nicey.

00:37:16.210 --> 00:37:22.760
So we said that in this wave
form, the sequence business,

00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:25.510
sampling is only
one way to go.

00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:29.370
I'm going to show that to you
right away at the beginning by

00:37:29.370 --> 00:37:31.220
talking about Fourier series.

00:37:35.570 --> 00:37:39.590
How many of you have studied
Fourier series and say

00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:44.550
spending more than a couple of
hours of your life thinking

00:37:44.550 --> 00:37:45.860
about Fourier series?

00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:52.880
OK, good, quite a few
of you, that's nice.

00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:55.420
Because we have to assume that
you know a little bit about

00:37:55.420 --> 00:37:59.870
this, but probably
not a whole lot.

00:37:59.870 --> 00:38:02.980
There's a formula for a Fourier
series, which is

00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:05.660
probably not the formula
for a Fourier series

00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:07.140
that you're used to.

00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:10.510
It says the Fourier series of
a time-limited function

00:38:10.510 --> 00:38:14.830
matched the function to a
sequence of coefficients.

00:38:14.830 --> 00:38:16.660
Here's the formula.

00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:18.770
Here's the function.

00:38:18.770 --> 00:38:23.720
You can represent the function
as a sum of coefficients times

00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:27.270
these complex exponentials.

00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:30.760
You do that over this interval
minus capital T over 2 less

00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:34.540
than or equal to t, less than or
equal to capital T over 2.

00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:38.690
The complex coefficients satisfy
this equation here.

00:38:38.690 --> 00:38:41.250
That's just what you've
seen before.

00:38:41.250 --> 00:38:43.800
The way this is different from
what you've probably seen

00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:47.760
before is that most people think
that you use Fourier

00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:51.300
series for periodic functions.

00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:57.640
In other words, if we leave out
this part here, leave out

00:38:57.640 --> 00:39:02.700
this, then this quantity here
is a periodic function,

00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:09.690
because each of the what have
you are all squiggling around

00:39:09.690 --> 00:39:16.540
with a period which is a
sub-multiple of capital T. So

00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:18.340
that, in fact, this
is a periodic

00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:21.660
function with period t.

00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:24.750
If I think of it as a periodic
function I don't have to worry

00:39:24.750 --> 00:39:30.490
about this, this still works
for any periodic function.

00:39:30.490 --> 00:39:34.820
The problem is this isn't the
way the Fourier series is

00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:36.730
usually used.

00:39:36.730 --> 00:39:40.360
Occasionally, you want to talk
about periodic functions, but

00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:44.200
most often what you want to do
is you want to take a function

00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:48.020
which exists only over some
finite interval and you want

00:39:48.020 --> 00:39:50.840
some way of mapping that
function into a set of

00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:52.220
coefficients.

00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:55.610
I take a function only over the
interval minus t over 2 to

00:39:55.610 --> 00:39:59.610
capital T over 2, and I can map
that into a sequence of

00:39:59.610 --> 00:40:04.220
coefficients, I have, in fact,
done what I said we're

00:40:04.220 --> 00:40:07.990
interested in doing right now,
which is turning a wave form

00:40:07.990 --> 00:40:10.360
into a sequence.

00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:13.630
The only problem with it is
it's a fine duration wave

00:40:13.630 --> 00:40:15.640
form, which I'm turning
into a sequence.

00:40:18.270 --> 00:40:21.570
Now how do you do
speech coding?

00:40:21.570 --> 00:40:24.580
There's an almost universal way
of doing speech coding now

00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:31.090
of turning speech, analog wave
forms, into actual data, into

00:40:31.090 --> 00:40:32.940
binary data.

00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:36.670
The way that it always starts, I
mean everybody has their own

00:40:36.670 --> 00:40:40.600
way of doing it, but almost
everyone takes the speech wave

00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:45.900
form and segments it into 20
millisecond intervals.

00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:50.370
Each 20 millisecond interval
is then encoded into a

00:40:50.370 --> 00:40:52.600
sequence of coefficients.

00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:56.120
You can think of that as taking
each 20 millisecond

00:40:56.120 --> 00:41:01.250
interval, creating a Fourier
series for it, and the Fourier

00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:03.840
series coefficients
then represent the

00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:05.590
function in that interval.

00:41:05.590 --> 00:41:08.460
You go on to the next interval,
you get another

00:41:08.460 --> 00:41:12.590
sequence of Fourier coefficients
and so forth.

00:41:12.590 --> 00:41:16.330
Now, most of these very
sophisticated voice coders

00:41:16.330 --> 00:41:20.090
don't really use the Fourier
series coefficients because

00:41:20.090 --> 00:41:22.820
there's a great deal of
structure in voice, and the

00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:25.310
Fourier series is designed
to deal with any

00:41:25.310 --> 00:41:26.560
old thing at all.

00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:33.450
But the Fourier series is a good
first order approximation

00:41:33.450 --> 00:41:37.540
to what's going on when you're
dealing with voice coding.

00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:40.590
when you're dealing with voice
coding you are certainly

00:41:40.590 --> 00:41:43.810
looking at frequencies, you're
looking at formats, which are

00:41:43.810 --> 00:41:45.410
ranges of frequencies.

00:41:45.410 --> 00:41:48.330
If you want to think about those
problems, you better

00:41:48.330 --> 00:41:50.860
start to think in
these ways here.

00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:55.650
So anyway, this is not just
mathematics, this is one of

00:41:55.650 --> 00:42:02.430
the things that we need to
understand how you do actual

00:42:02.430 --> 00:42:05.390
wave forms to sequences.

00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:07.430
We're not going to talk too
much about where these

00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:10.850
formulas come from too much.

00:42:10.850 --> 00:42:14.650
It is interesting that this
also works for complex

00:42:14.650 --> 00:42:17.270
functions as well as
real functions.

00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:20.440
There's a nice sort of symmetry
there, because the

00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:26.690
coefficients are all going to be
complex anyway, because of

00:42:26.690 --> 00:42:28.580
these things here which
are complex.

00:42:28.580 --> 00:42:32.240
Incidentally, we always use i in
this course for the square

00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:34.500
root of minus 1.

00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:37.460
Electrical engineers have
traditionally used the letter

00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:42.710
j for the square root of minus
1 for the rather poor reason

00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:46.270
that they like to refer
to current as i.

00:42:46.270 --> 00:42:49.870
In the first two years of an
earlier electrical engineering

00:42:49.870 --> 00:42:55.390
education back 50 years or so
ago, you spent so much time

00:42:55.390 --> 00:42:59.430
talking about voltages and
currents that using the letter

00:42:59.430 --> 00:43:02.480
i for anything other than
current was just an

00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:03.630
abomination.

00:43:03.630 --> 00:43:06.680
Well, everybody else in the
world uses i for the square

00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:08.630
root of minus 1.

00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:11.620
So in this course we're going
to do the same thing.

00:43:11.620 --> 00:43:14.170
I would urge you to get used
to it because then you can

00:43:14.170 --> 00:43:18.910
talk to people other than
electrical engineers, and

00:43:18.910 --> 00:43:21.150
you'll probably have to spend
a lot of time in your life

00:43:21.150 --> 00:43:23.100
talking to other people.

00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:26.490
You shouldn't expect them to get
used to your conventions,

00:43:26.490 --> 00:43:30.180
you should try to do a little
to get used to their

00:43:30.180 --> 00:43:33.250
conventions.

00:43:33.250 --> 00:43:36.330
So there's that peculiarity.

00:43:36.330 --> 00:43:41.730
We're also using this complex
notation throughout.

00:43:41.730 --> 00:43:44.970
You could do this in terms of
sines and cosines, which is

00:43:44.970 --> 00:43:48.180
probably the way you
first learned it.

00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:50.730
I'm sure for any of you who
spent more than a very, very

00:43:50.730 --> 00:43:53.930
small amount of time dealing
with Fourier series, you did

00:43:53.930 --> 00:43:58.910
enough with it to realize that
just computationally going

00:43:58.910 --> 00:44:03.330
from sines and cosines to
complex exponentials just

00:44:03.330 --> 00:44:07.470
makes life so much easier and
makes your formula so much

00:44:07.470 --> 00:44:10.770
shorter that you
want to do it.

00:44:10.770 --> 00:44:15.420
So anyway, we want to make this
work for complex signals

00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:16.880
as well as anything else.

00:44:19.900 --> 00:44:23.130
I do want to verify the formula
for these Fourier

00:44:23.130 --> 00:44:24.020
coefficients.

00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:26.450
Incidentally, the other thing
that I'll be doing which is a

00:44:26.450 --> 00:44:30.250
little bit weird here is that
most people when they talk

00:44:30.250 --> 00:44:34.400
about the Fourier integral and
the Fourier series they use

00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:38.240
capital letters to talk about
frequencies and they use

00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:42.390
little letters to talk
about signals.

00:44:42.390 --> 00:44:47.240
For us, we really want to use
capital letters to talk about

00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:50.950
random variables, and we do
that pretty consistently.

00:44:50.950 --> 00:44:53.700
Believe me, when we start
talking about random

00:44:53.700 --> 00:44:58.930
processes, you will get so
confused going back and forth

00:44:58.930 --> 00:45:03.670
between sample values and random
of variables, that

00:45:03.670 --> 00:45:08.400
having a notation way to keep
them straight will be very

00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:09.630
valuable to you.

00:45:09.630 --> 00:45:12.180
When you start reading the
literature you get even more

00:45:12.180 --> 00:45:16.330
confused because most people in
the literature don't tell

00:45:16.330 --> 00:45:18.620
you what it is that they're
talking about and they go back

00:45:18.620 --> 00:45:24.290
and forth between sample values
and random variables,

00:45:24.290 --> 00:45:31.280
oftentimes using the same symbol
in the same sentence

00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:34.070
for two different things.

00:45:34.070 --> 00:45:36.150
So I think that's a more
important thing to keep

00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:40.620
straight, so we'll always use
tildes to talk about frequency

00:45:40.620 --> 00:45:42.630
type things.

00:45:42.630 --> 00:45:45.840
You can see that these
coefficients here are, in

00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:48.790
fact, frequency-like things
because they're talking about

00:45:48.790 --> 00:45:52.050
how much of this wave form
is at a certain discrete

00:45:52.050 --> 00:45:55.860
frequency, and we'll come back
to talk about that later.

00:45:55.860 --> 00:45:59.200
But anyway, if you want to
verify the formula for this,

00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:04.720
what we're going to do is to
start out by looking at --

00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:10.510
this is where having smaller
data would be a big help.

00:46:10.510 --> 00:46:14.990
u of t is equal to
this sum here.

00:46:14.990 --> 00:46:21.610
So I'm going to replace u of t
in this formula by this sum.

00:46:21.610 --> 00:46:24.750
I'm going to make the index
m because I already

00:46:24.750 --> 00:46:26.650
have a k over here.

00:46:26.650 --> 00:46:29.630
When we have a k over here and
you're talking about this, you

00:46:29.630 --> 00:46:31.820
don't want to get your
indexes mixed.

00:46:31.820 --> 00:46:36.650
So if I'm trying to see what
this looks like, I want to

00:46:36.650 --> 00:46:40.110
represent as the integral from
minus t over 2 to plus t over

00:46:40.110 --> 00:46:46.090
2 of this representated as a sum
with e to the minus 2 pi i

00:46:46.090 --> 00:46:50.100
kt over t taken into
account over here.

00:46:50.100 --> 00:46:52.280
So what happens here?

00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:55.210
Here we have an integral
of a sum.

00:46:55.210 --> 00:46:58.080
Later on we're going to be a
little bit careful about

00:46:58.080 --> 00:47:05.650
interchanging integrals and
sums, but for now let's not

00:47:05.650 --> 00:47:07.420
worry about that at all.

00:47:07.420 --> 00:47:12.100
I suggest to all of you, never
worry about interchanging

00:47:12.100 --> 00:47:14.960
integrals and sums until
after you understand

00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:16.930
what's going on.

00:47:16.930 --> 00:47:20.170
Because if you start asking
about that --

00:47:20.170 --> 00:47:22.580
I mean that's a detail.

00:47:22.580 --> 00:47:25.890
You look at what's going on in
a major way first, and then

00:47:25.890 --> 00:47:29.410
you go back to check that
sort of thing out.

00:47:29.410 --> 00:47:32.210
So when we look at this integral
here, when we take

00:47:32.210 --> 00:47:37.090
the sum outside, we have the sum
over m of an integral over

00:47:37.090 --> 00:47:44.520
one cycle of these quantities
here, of this times e to the 2

00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:47.390
pi i times m minus kt over t.

00:47:47.390 --> 00:47:52.580
Now, you look at this integral
here of a complex exponential

00:47:52.580 --> 00:47:54.600
as it's rotating around.

00:47:54.600 --> 00:48:00.910
In the period of time t, this
always rotates around some

00:48:00.910 --> 00:48:02.190
integer number of times.

00:48:02.190 --> 00:48:05.690
If m is equal to k, it doesn't
rotate at all, it just sticks

00:48:05.690 --> 00:48:08.370
where it is, at 1.

00:48:08.370 --> 00:48:11.430
If m is unequal to k,
it goes around some

00:48:11.430 --> 00:48:12.900
integer number of times.

00:48:12.900 --> 00:48:18.430
If I'm thinking of this as being
real and this as being

00:48:18.430 --> 00:48:22.970
imaginary, I'm just running
around this circle here.

00:48:22.970 --> 00:48:26.370
So what happens when I run
around the circle once?

00:48:26.370 --> 00:48:29.730
The integral is zero because
I'm up here as much as I'm

00:48:29.730 --> 00:48:32.860
down here, I'm over here as
much as I'm over here.

00:48:32.860 --> 00:48:37.290
So this integral is always zero,
which says that all of

00:48:37.290 --> 00:48:41.940
these terms except when m
is equal to k disappear.

00:48:41.940 --> 00:48:46.710
So that means I wind up with
just this one term u hat of k

00:48:46.710 --> 00:48:51.030
times the integral from minus
t over 2 to t over 2dt.

00:48:51.030 --> 00:48:54.590
That's another integral I can
evaluate, and it's equal to

00:48:54.590 --> 00:48:57.200
capital T times u sub k.

00:48:57.200 --> 00:49:03.150
So, u sub k is this quantity
here divided by t, which is

00:49:03.150 --> 00:49:06.610
what we said over here.

00:49:06.610 --> 00:49:08.250
In fact, that argument,
you can make it

00:49:08.250 --> 00:49:11.310
precise and it works.

00:49:11.310 --> 00:49:21.390
So what this is saying is that,
in fact, if you look at

00:49:21.390 --> 00:49:28.600
these Fourier series formulas,
this thing is pretty simple in

00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:30.790
terms of this.

00:49:30.790 --> 00:49:35.410
The question which is more
difficult is what functions

00:49:35.410 --> 00:49:39.100
can you represent in this way
and what functions can't you

00:49:39.100 --> 00:49:41.460
represent in this way.

00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:45.655
The easy answer is if you can
think of it you can represent

00:49:45.655 --> 00:49:48.390
it in this way.

00:49:48.390 --> 00:49:52.280
But if you stop and think about
it for six months, then

00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:54.760
that might not be
true anymore.

00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:58.260
So if you become very good at
this, you can find examples

00:49:58.260 --> 00:50:00.770
where it doesn't work,
and we'll talk about

00:50:00.770 --> 00:50:02.020
that as we go on.

00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:15.995
Let's define this rectangular
function because we're going

00:50:15.995 --> 00:50:17.990
to be using it all the time.

00:50:17.990 --> 00:50:20.650
You probably used it when
dealing with the Fourier

00:50:20.650 --> 00:50:22.940
integral all the time because
you all know that a

00:50:22.940 --> 00:50:26.890
rectangular function is a
Fourier transform of a sync

00:50:26.890 --> 00:50:28.850
function where a sync
function is a sine

00:50:28.850 --> 00:50:31.260
x over x type function.

00:50:31.260 --> 00:50:32.900
If you don't remember
that, fine.

00:50:32.900 --> 00:50:38.190
But anyway, this function is 1
in the interval minus 1/2 to

00:50:38.190 --> 00:50:43.020
plus 1/2 and it's 0 everywhere
else, which is why it's called

00:50:43.020 --> 00:50:44.080
a rectangular function.

00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:45.330
It looks like this.

00:50:52.510 --> 00:50:56.490
We do it from minus 1/2 to plus
1/2 so it has area 1.

00:51:01.770 --> 00:51:05.310
In terms of that, we can express
the formula for a

00:51:05.310 --> 00:51:11.450
time-limited function as this
sum here, uk times these

00:51:11.450 --> 00:51:16.500
complex exponentials times this
rectangular function.

00:51:16.500 --> 00:51:19.620
How many of you can see it ought
to be rectangle of t

00:51:19.620 --> 00:51:23.360
over capital T instead of
rectangle of t times t?

00:51:26.550 --> 00:51:27.430
Good.

00:51:27.430 --> 00:51:28.620
I can't.

00:51:28.620 --> 00:51:32.880
I always have to take two
minutes doing that every time

00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:35.910
I do it, and if you can
see it in your mind

00:51:35.910 --> 00:51:38.180
you're extremely fortunate.

00:51:38.180 --> 00:51:43.410
When we work with these things
for a while, you will become

00:51:43.410 --> 00:51:45.680
more adept at doing
things like that.

00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:48.180
But anyway, this works.

00:51:48.180 --> 00:51:50.360
I want to look at
an example now.

00:51:50.360 --> 00:51:52.310
And there's several reasons
I want to look at this.

00:51:52.310 --> 00:51:56.640
One is to just look at what
a Fourier series does.

00:51:56.640 --> 00:51:59.670
Suppose we expand the function,
the rectangular

00:51:59.670 --> 00:52:02.160
function of t over 2.

00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:06.560
Now the rectangular function of
t over 2 is going to be 1

00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:10.660
from minus 1/4 to plus 1/4,
instead of minus 1/2 to plus

00:52:10.660 --> 00:52:14.400
1/2, because of the 2 in here.

00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:17.130
We want to expand it in a
Fourier series over the

00:52:17.130 --> 00:52:20.620
interval minus 1/2
to plus 1/2.

00:52:20.620 --> 00:52:23.080
One of the things this is
telling you is that when

00:52:23.080 --> 00:52:27.110
you're expanding something in a
Fourier series, you have to

00:52:27.110 --> 00:52:29.920
be quite explicit about what
the interval is that you're

00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:31.490
expanding it over.

00:52:31.490 --> 00:52:35.420
Because I could also find a
Fourier series here using the

00:52:35.420 --> 00:52:39.060
interval minus 1/4 to plus 1/4,
which would be a whole

00:52:39.060 --> 00:52:40.390
lot easier.

00:52:40.390 --> 00:52:43.180
But we're gluttons
for punishment.

00:52:43.180 --> 00:52:45.860
So we're expanding in a Fourier
series over the bigger

00:52:45.860 --> 00:52:48.270
interval from here to there.

00:52:48.270 --> 00:52:52.440
We go through these formulas
calculating u sub k.

00:52:52.440 --> 00:52:55.640
We can easily do it for
the first one, which

00:52:55.640 --> 00:52:56.480
is just u sub zero.

00:52:56.480 --> 00:53:00.540
It's just the average value in
this interval minus 1/2 to

00:53:00.540 --> 00:53:02.850
1/2, which is 1/2.

00:53:02.850 --> 00:53:05.950
The next term turns out to
be 2 over pi times the

00:53:05.950 --> 00:53:07.980
cosine of 2 pi t.

00:53:07.980 --> 00:53:11.040
We can evaluate all of them just
going through more and

00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:12.190
more junk like that.

00:53:12.190 --> 00:53:13.550
But look at what's happened.

00:53:13.550 --> 00:53:16.700
We started out with a
rectangular function.

00:53:16.700 --> 00:53:20.730
When we evaluate more and more
terms of this Fourier series,

00:53:20.730 --> 00:53:24.490
the Fourier series terms
are all very smooth.

00:53:24.490 --> 00:53:28.780
So what we're doing is trying
to represent something with

00:53:28.780 --> 00:53:34.910
sharp corners by a series
of smooth functions.

00:53:34.910 --> 00:53:37.410
Which means if we're going to be
able to represent it, we're

00:53:37.410 --> 00:53:40.100
only going to be able to
represent it by adding on more

00:53:40.100 --> 00:53:42.510
and more terms, which hopefully
are going to be

00:53:42.510 --> 00:53:46.210
coming closer and closer to
approximating this the way it

00:53:46.210 --> 00:53:47.930
should be approximated.

00:53:47.930 --> 00:53:51.190
Now if you look at these terms
here, these Fourier series,

00:53:51.190 --> 00:53:55.470
you will notice that every one
of them, except this original

00:53:55.470 --> 00:53:56.910
one which is at 1/2 --

00:54:00.490 --> 00:54:03.480
so this is the first term here
in the Fourier series.

00:54:03.480 --> 00:54:06.110
The second term is to add
on that cosine term.

00:54:06.110 --> 00:54:09.060
The first term is sitting
here at 1/2.

00:54:09.060 --> 00:54:13.440
Every other one of them is
zero at minus 1/4 and

00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:15.100
zero at plus 1/4.

00:54:15.100 --> 00:54:19.430
So when we add up all of those
terms, what we wind up with is

00:54:19.430 --> 00:54:23.450
not what we started out with,
but something which is 0 from

00:54:23.450 --> 00:54:27.120
minus 1/2 to minus 1/4.

00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:30.600
It's 1/2 at the value
minus 1/2.

00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:32.860
It's 1 all along here.

00:54:32.860 --> 00:54:38.420
It's 1/2 over here,
and 0 down here.

00:54:38.420 --> 00:54:41.430
Every time you study Fourier
series you find out about

00:54:41.430 --> 00:54:43.170
these bizarre things.

00:54:43.170 --> 00:54:46.970
Every time you have a
discontinuity in the function,

00:54:46.970 --> 00:54:50.110
the Fourier series comes
out to split the

00:54:50.110 --> 00:54:51.910
difference on you.

00:54:51.910 --> 00:54:55.920
So you like to define your
functions at discontinuities

00:54:55.920 --> 00:55:02.930
as either being here at minus
1/4 or here at minus 1/4.

00:55:02.930 --> 00:55:06.240
Then when you come back from the
Fourier series, it forces

00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:07.970
you to be there.

00:55:07.970 --> 00:55:09.380
Well, what does this say?

00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:24.190
It says that u of t, which we
started out defining to have a

00:55:24.190 --> 00:55:30.750
certain value at minus 1/4 and
plus 1/4, is equal to its

00:55:30.750 --> 00:55:33.720
Fourier series everywhere
except here and here.

00:55:33.720 --> 00:55:36.330
I have to ask you to
take that on faith.

00:55:36.330 --> 00:55:39.230
But you can see that it's
not equal to it at those

00:55:39.230 --> 00:55:40.680
discontinuities.

00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:43.030
And it shouldn't be surprising
that it's not equal to its

00:55:43.030 --> 00:55:44.410
discontinuities.

00:55:44.410 --> 00:55:49.060
I could have defined it as being
zero at minus 1/4 or 1

00:55:49.060 --> 00:55:52.990
at minus 1/4, and just that one
point shouldn't change our

00:55:52.990 --> 00:55:55.390
integrals too much.

00:55:55.390 --> 00:56:01.300
Because of that as engineers,
I mean at some level we have

00:56:01.300 --> 00:56:04.620
to say we don't care.

00:56:04.620 --> 00:56:06.630
It's only a modeling issue.

00:56:06.630 --> 00:56:10.900
Functions don't have
perfectly straight

00:56:10.900 --> 00:56:13.280
discontinuities in them.

00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:15.640
If they do you don't care how
you define it, it's a

00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:17.900
discontinuity.

00:56:17.900 --> 00:56:21.390
This Fourier series is sort
of coming back and

00:56:21.390 --> 00:56:23.930
slapping us with that.

00:56:23.930 --> 00:56:28.200
And it's saying OK, the function
u of t is not the

00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:32.100
same as its Fourier series
because the two are different

00:56:32.100 --> 00:56:33.520
at these two points.

00:56:33.520 --> 00:56:35.980
You say OK, I don't care that
they're not different at those

00:56:35.980 --> 00:56:36.860
two points.

00:56:36.860 --> 00:56:40.350
They're the same everywhere
else.

00:56:40.350 --> 00:56:43.290
A mathematician comes back and
says a function is a function

00:56:43.290 --> 00:56:46.990
is a function, and a function
is defined at every value of

00:56:46.990 --> 00:56:52.210
t, and if u of t is equal to v
of t, it means that at every

00:56:52.210 --> 00:56:55.360
value of t, u of t is
equal to v of t.

00:56:55.360 --> 00:56:58.600
And you say ah.

00:56:58.600 --> 00:57:06.600
Well, turns out that by studying
Lebesgue theory, all

00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:08.010
of those problems
get resolved.

00:57:08.010 --> 00:57:11.820
Lebesgue was a very powerful
mathematician.

00:57:11.820 --> 00:57:14.410
But you know at some
level deep in his

00:57:14.410 --> 00:57:16.950
heart, he was an engineer.

00:57:16.950 --> 00:57:19.480
He was trying to get rid of all
this nonsense that people

00:57:19.480 --> 00:57:22.990
talked about, and he resolved
this question about how to

00:57:22.990 --> 00:57:27.570
talk about these functions
in a nice way.

00:57:27.570 --> 00:57:29.770
I mean really, good
engineers are

00:57:29.770 --> 00:57:31.950
mathematicians at heart, too.

00:57:31.950 --> 00:57:34.520
I mean at some level we
all become the same.

00:57:38.020 --> 00:57:42.460
What Lebesgue tried to say is
that two functions are said to

00:57:42.460 --> 00:57:46.300
be equivalent in
the L2 sense --

00:57:46.300 --> 00:57:49.600
I'll talk about this L2 notation
later -- if their

00:57:49.600 --> 00:57:51.320
difference has zero energy.

00:57:51.320 --> 00:57:55.420
In other words, Lebesgue said
what's really important is not

00:57:55.420 --> 00:58:02.180
what functions are at each
point, but really things about

00:58:02.180 --> 00:58:03.670
their energy.

00:58:03.670 --> 00:58:08.600
So what you would like to have
is if u of t and v of t, if

00:58:08.600 --> 00:58:11.440
the difference between them, you
take the magnitude of that

00:58:11.440 --> 00:58:17.820
and you square it, if that
difference is equal to zero,

00:58:17.820 --> 00:58:21.410
you have to recognize that
there's no possible way that

00:58:21.410 --> 00:58:24.910
you could ever distinguish those
two functions, except

00:58:24.910 --> 00:58:27.580
just by fiat, by saying this
is equal to this and

00:58:27.580 --> 00:58:28.790
not equal to that.

00:58:28.790 --> 00:58:30.660
That's the only way you
could straighten

00:58:30.660 --> 00:58:34.000
that out in your minds.

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:37.260
So we say the two functions
are L2 equivalent if their

00:58:37.260 --> 00:58:39.720
difference has zero energy.

00:58:39.720 --> 00:58:41.760
Well, we have a couple
of problems there.

00:58:41.760 --> 00:58:45.000
How do we define that?

00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:48.420
At this point, we're sort
of already deep in the

00:58:48.420 --> 00:58:52.590
mathematical soup because, in
fact, we're trying to make

00:58:52.590 --> 00:58:58.140
these small distinctions and
make them make sense.

00:58:58.140 --> 00:59:00.940
We're also going to see, as we
go on to two functions that

00:59:00.940 --> 00:59:04.940
have the same Fourier series,
are L2 equivalent, because if

00:59:04.940 --> 00:59:09.100
two functions have the same
Fourier series, put one of

00:59:09.100 --> 00:59:12.090
them there and one of them
there, and we're going to see

00:59:12.090 --> 00:59:14.880
that when we expand it in a
Fourier series they're both

00:59:14.880 --> 00:59:18.080
the same, and we're going to see
that, in fact, what that

00:59:18.080 --> 00:59:21.680
means is that their energy
difference has to be zero.

00:59:21.680 --> 00:59:24.800
Which says that if you don't
talk about functions, but if

00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:28.520
you talk about their Fourier
series, all of these

00:59:28.520 --> 00:59:32.220
confusions go away about things
having to be equal

00:59:32.220 --> 00:59:34.540
point-wise.

00:59:34.540 --> 00:59:38.550
So let's go on and try to say
a little more about this.

00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:47.500
One of the problems that we come
up with is that not all

00:59:47.500 --> 00:59:51.740
time-limited functions, in fact,
have Fourier series,

00:59:51.740 --> 00:59:53.820
even in a sense of
L2 equivalents.

00:59:53.820 --> 00:59:57.950
You can think of functions which
are so awful that they

00:59:57.950 --> 01:00:01.100
don't have a Fourier series,
although it's

01:00:01.100 --> 01:00:03.530
hard to find them.

01:00:03.530 --> 01:00:06.040
We really want to make
general statements

01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:08.240
about classes of functions.

01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:10.140
Why do we want to do that?

01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:13.570
Well, I can give you
two reasons for it.

01:00:13.570 --> 01:00:17.740
The two reasons are both, I
think, both good reasons.

01:00:17.740 --> 01:00:23.610
The first reason is that as
we deal particularly with

01:00:23.610 --> 01:00:28.200
channels, we have to look at
things both in a time domain

01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:30.690
and in a frequency domain.

01:00:30.690 --> 01:00:33.210
We look at things in the domain
and the frequency

01:00:33.210 --> 01:00:36.930
domain, we have a function in
a time domain, we have a

01:00:36.930 --> 01:00:41.700
Fourier transform in the
frequency domain, and it turns

01:00:41.700 --> 01:00:48.460
out that nice properties in a
time domain are not always

01:00:48.460 --> 01:00:52.670
carried over to the frequency
domain and vice versa.

01:00:52.670 --> 01:00:56.180
Give me one example of that.

01:00:56.180 --> 01:00:58.980
Suppose you think
of a constant.

01:00:58.980 --> 01:01:03.620
The constant function, which
is equal to 1 everywhere on

01:01:03.620 --> 01:01:05.540
the real line.

01:01:05.540 --> 01:01:09.090
Nice function, right?

01:01:09.090 --> 01:01:12.760
It models various things
very well.

01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:17.170
It doesn't model physical
reality, really, because I

01:01:17.170 --> 01:01:20.960
mean you don't care what this
function was before

01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:23.820
the fourth ice age.

01:01:23.820 --> 01:01:27.040
You don't care what it is after
we all blow ourselves

01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:30.520
up, I hope in not
too many years.

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:33.850
I mean I hope in more than
just a few years.

01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:41.900
Therefore, when we model
something as a constant, what

01:01:41.900 --> 01:01:44.090
do we mean?

01:01:44.090 --> 01:01:47.270
We mean that over the interval
of time that we're interested

01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:51.600
in, this function is equal
to a constant.

01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:54.850
And it means we don't want to
specify what the time interval

01:01:54.850 --> 01:01:58.800
is that we're interested in,
which is a common thing,

01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:02.840
because you don't want to set
time limits on something.

01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:07.550
Now, you take those functions
which go on and on forever.

01:02:07.550 --> 01:02:10.010
Well, the Fourier series, you
don't have any problem with

01:02:10.010 --> 01:02:13.770
them because we're going to
truncate the function anyway

01:02:13.770 --> 01:02:16.000
before we take a
Fourier series.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:20.680
But if we look at the Fourier
integral, and we'll see this

01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:23.860
as soon as we get into the
Fourier integral, the awful

01:02:23.860 --> 01:02:28.310
thing is that what has happened
in the thousand years

01:02:28.310 --> 01:02:32.580
before the fourth ice age back,
is just as important in

01:02:32.580 --> 01:02:35.340
the Fourier transform as
what happens in the

01:02:35.340 --> 01:02:38.600
thousand years right now.

01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:40.930
In other words, everything
is important.

01:02:40.930 --> 01:02:44.420
Things back in the dim
past clobber you

01:02:44.420 --> 01:02:46.400
in a frequency domain.

01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:49.310
Things in the distant future
clobber you in

01:02:49.310 --> 01:02:51.020
the frequency domain.

01:02:51.020 --> 01:02:54.540
Therefore, since we have to
face the fact that we're

01:02:54.540 --> 01:02:57.920
dealing with approximations,
since we have to face the fact

01:02:57.920 --> 01:03:01.010
that we want to ignore things
-- back there we want to

01:03:01.010 --> 01:03:03.530
ignore things there.

01:03:03.530 --> 01:03:06.370
When we look at constants in the
frequency domain, we don't

01:03:06.370 --> 01:03:09.750
mean that something is constant
over all frequency.

01:03:09.750 --> 01:03:12.390
We mean it's constant over the
range of frequencies that

01:03:12.390 --> 01:03:15.030
we're interested in and we don't
want to specify what

01:03:15.030 --> 01:03:16.050
that range is.

01:03:16.050 --> 01:03:20.940
You have the same problems going
from there back to time.

01:03:20.940 --> 01:03:24.860
So, as soon as we face the
fact that we're really

01:03:24.860 --> 01:03:28.670
interested in approximations,
and the approximations that we

01:03:28.670 --> 01:03:31.900
deal with normally in time
are not the same as the

01:03:31.900 --> 01:03:38.160
approximations we deal with in
frequency, at that point, we

01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:41.250
start to realize that we have
to be able to make general

01:03:41.250 --> 01:03:43.930
statements about what
functions do

01:03:43.930 --> 01:03:46.140
what kinds of things.

01:03:46.140 --> 01:03:48.760
We have to make general
statements about what has a

01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:51.710
Fourier transform, what doesn't,
what has a Fourier

01:03:51.710 --> 01:03:54.630
series, what doesn't have
a Fourier series.

01:03:54.630 --> 01:03:58.420
Now, one of the things we're
aiming at is to define a class

01:03:58.420 --> 01:04:01.720
of functions called
L2 functions.

01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:05.690
These are basically functions
which have finite energy.

01:04:05.690 --> 01:04:09.140
The nice thing about those
functions is that every one of

01:04:09.140 --> 01:04:12.730
them has a Fourier transform,
and the Fourier transform is

01:04:12.730 --> 01:04:15.680
also an L2 function.

01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:18.990
All the other things that you
deal with -- continuity,

01:04:18.990 --> 01:04:22.950
things like that -- doesn't
carry over at all.

01:04:22.950 --> 01:04:26.830
L2 is the only property that I
know of that really carries

01:04:26.830 --> 01:04:31.110
over from time functions
to Fourier transform.

01:04:31.110 --> 01:04:35.070
So we really want to be able
to talk about that.

01:04:35.070 --> 01:04:38.940
So we want to talk about these
finite energy functions.

01:04:38.940 --> 01:04:41.970
We want to be able to talk
about representing finite

01:04:41.970 --> 01:04:43.520
energy functions.

01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:47.450
I say here, all physical wave
forms have finite energy, but

01:04:47.450 --> 01:04:48.410
their models do not

01:04:48.410 --> 01:04:51.130
necessarily have finite energy.

01:04:51.130 --> 01:04:53.860
In other words, we look at a
constant -- a constant does

01:04:53.860 --> 01:04:56.050
not have finite energy.

01:04:56.050 --> 01:04:58.530
How about an impulse?

01:04:58.530 --> 01:05:00.270
Does an impulse have
finite energy?

01:05:00.270 --> 01:05:01.520
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:05:08.250 --> 01:05:09.990
PROFESSOR: What?

01:05:09.990 --> 01:05:11.130
Yes?

01:05:11.130 --> 01:05:12.970
How many people think
the answer is yes?

01:05:18.460 --> 01:05:20.600
The hands are going
up very slow.

01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:22.880
Well, the answer is no.

01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:24.130
Let me explain why.

01:05:30.190 --> 01:05:32.960
It's something you
should know.

01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:36.620
But it's something that you get
blinded by studying too

01:05:36.620 --> 01:05:39.600
much signals and systems
before you study any

01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:43.840
communication, because you're
talking about all sorts of

01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:50.710
transforms, all sorts of things
that you deal with as

01:05:50.710 --> 01:05:53.400
functions, which you're dealing
with electronically,

01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:55.520
instead of those functions
that you're interested in

01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:57.530
transmitting.

01:05:57.530 --> 01:06:05.940
If you think of a narrow pulse
of height 1 over epsilon, and

01:06:05.940 --> 01:06:12.660
of width epsilon, it
has unit area.

01:06:12.660 --> 01:06:14.820
So I make epsilon very,
very small.

01:06:14.820 --> 01:06:18.600
This starts to look like
a unit impulse, right?

01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:21.310
In fact, you usually define a
unit impulse somehow or other

01:06:21.310 --> 01:06:24.270
as thinking of some limiting
process for this kind of

01:06:24.270 --> 01:06:26.060
rectangular function.

01:06:26.060 --> 01:06:29.370
What's the energy of
that function?

01:06:29.370 --> 01:06:31.360
What?

01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:33.070
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE PHRASE].

01:06:33.070 --> 01:06:35.420
PROFESSOR: Energy is 1
over epsilon, yes.

01:06:41.130 --> 01:06:43.790
What happens as epsilon
goes to infinity?

01:06:43.790 --> 01:06:45.040
Bing.

01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:49.570
If you put an impulse into
an electrical circuit

01:06:49.570 --> 01:06:50.820
it'll blow it up.

01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:55.960
You usually don't care about
that because you don't see

01:06:55.960 --> 01:06:59.250
impulses in the physical
world.

01:06:59.250 --> 01:07:04.900
You see things which are so
narrow and so tall that in

01:07:04.900 --> 01:07:09.200
terms of the filters that you
put them through, which have

01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:16.170
smaller bandwidth, those narrow
pulses behave very

01:07:16.170 --> 01:07:19.390
nicely, and as you make those
narrow impulses more and more

01:07:19.390 --> 01:07:23.580
high and more and more narrow,
they behave the same way after

01:07:23.580 --> 01:07:25.980
they go through a filter.

01:07:25.980 --> 01:07:30.160
But before that they're ugly and
they have infinite energy.

01:07:32.970 --> 01:07:36.420
In fact, you could determine
that from two of the

01:07:36.420 --> 01:07:40.240
statements I made earlier, and
I'm sure I can't blame any of

01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:42.280
you for not doing that.

01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:46.140
I said that all finite energy
functions have Fourier

01:07:46.140 --> 01:07:49.600
transforms which are finite
energy, and you all know that

01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:52.810
the Fourier transform of a unit
impulse is a constant,

01:07:52.810 --> 01:07:56.510
and the Fourier transform of a
constant is a unit impulse.

01:07:56.510 --> 01:07:59.230
Therefore, if the constant has
infinite energy, the unit

01:07:59.230 --> 01:08:03.090
impulse has to have infinity
energy also.

01:08:03.090 --> 01:08:10.040
So anyway, we have all these
functions we like to deal with

01:08:10.040 --> 01:08:13.500
all the time which do not
have finite energy.

01:08:13.500 --> 01:08:17.380
We don't want to deal with
those in this course, not

01:08:17.380 --> 01:08:21.240
because they aren't very useful
in signal processing,

01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:26.540
but because they aren't useful
as wave forms which we will

01:08:26.540 --> 01:08:30.880
transmit, and they aren't very
useful as source wave forms.

01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:33.750
Source wave forms do not
behave that way.

01:08:33.750 --> 01:08:37.030
Source wave forms that we want
to encode all have finite

01:08:37.030 --> 01:08:40.470
energy, and we'll see
why as we go on.

01:08:40.470 --> 01:08:46.520
So now I want to try to tell
you what the big theorem is

01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:49.620
about Fourier series.

01:08:49.620 --> 01:08:53.660
I will do this in terms of a
bunch of things that you don't

01:08:53.660 --> 01:08:55.970
understand yet.

01:08:55.970 --> 01:09:00.870
The theorem says we're looking
at a function u of t, which is

01:09:00.870 --> 01:09:02.580
time-limited --

01:09:02.580 --> 01:09:05.800
nothing strange there, that's
what we've been looking at all

01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:08.540
along so far.

01:09:08.540 --> 01:09:12.540
It's a function that goes from
minus t over 2 to t over 2,

01:09:12.540 --> 01:09:15.530
and we'll let it go into the
complex numbers because we

01:09:15.530 --> 01:09:18.050
said it's just as easy
to deal with complex

01:09:18.050 --> 01:09:21.440
functions as real functions.

01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:26.220
We're going to assume that
it has finite energy.

01:09:26.220 --> 01:09:33.430
Then it says for each index k,
the Lebesgue integral, u sub k

01:09:33.430 --> 01:09:34.230
equals this.

01:09:34.230 --> 01:09:37.430
In other words, this is the
formula for finding the

01:09:37.430 --> 01:09:40.040
Fourier series coefficient.

01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:42.770
What we're saying here is we
have to redefine that to be a

01:09:42.770 --> 01:09:45.890
Lebesgue integrall instead
of a Reimann integral.

01:09:45.890 --> 01:09:52.020
But anyway, when you define it
that way it always exists and

01:09:52.020 --> 01:09:55.360
it is always finite,
necessarily.

01:09:55.360 --> 01:10:00.090
It can't be infinite,
it can't not exist.

01:10:00.090 --> 01:10:02.120
It just is there.

01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:07.180
The other thing is -- now this
formula is harder to swallow

01:10:07.180 --> 01:10:09.150
as a whole.

01:10:09.150 --> 01:10:10.790
Let's try to look at it.

01:10:10.790 --> 01:10:17.810
What's inside of here is the
difference between u of t and

01:10:17.810 --> 01:10:22.240
a finite approximation to
the Fourier series.

01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:24.750
Now if you're taking a Fourier
series, whether you're taking

01:10:24.750 --> 01:10:27.760
it on a computer or calculating
it or what you're

01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:30.900
doing with it, you're
never going to take

01:10:30.900 --> 01:10:32.030
the infinite sum.

01:10:32.030 --> 01:10:34.240
You're always going to be
dealing with some finite

01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:36.710
approximation.

01:10:36.710 --> 01:10:39.910
This says that the different
between u of t and these

01:10:39.910 --> 01:10:44.850
finite approximations, if you
take that difference and you

01:10:44.850 --> 01:10:48.610
find the energy in that
difference, says the energy in

01:10:48.610 --> 01:10:51.420
that difference gets small.

01:10:51.420 --> 01:10:54.600
In other words, it says that
as you take more and more

01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:58.990
terms in your Fourier series,
you get a function which comes

01:10:58.990 --> 01:11:04.620
closer and closer to u of t in
terms of energy difference.

01:11:04.620 --> 01:11:07.026
So that's the kind of statement
that we want in this

01:11:07.026 --> 01:11:11.530
course, because we're aiming
towards saying that this in

01:11:11.530 --> 01:11:15.500
the limit looks like that in
terms of having zero energy

01:11:15.500 --> 01:11:17.220
difference between it.

01:11:17.220 --> 01:11:20.750
Namely, this is going to allow
this function to converge to

01:11:20.750 --> 01:11:24.360
one of these strange functions
that has bizarre values on

01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:29.980
discontinuities of u of t,
because that doesn't make any

01:11:29.980 --> 01:11:32.590
difference in terms of energy.

01:11:32.590 --> 01:11:35.170
It says also the energy
equation is satisfied.

01:11:35.170 --> 01:11:36.680
The energy equation --

01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:39.860
I didn't say it was the
energy equation --

01:11:43.270 --> 01:11:44.520
I hope I said what it was.

01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:51.360
Blah blah blah.

01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:54.670
I have to write it down.

01:11:59.250 --> 01:12:12.050
The energy equation says that
the integral of u of t

01:12:12.050 --> 01:12:18.590
magnitude squared dt from minus
t over 2, the t over 2

01:12:18.590 --> 01:12:30.620
is equal to the sum over k of u
hat of k magnitude squared.

01:12:34.770 --> 01:12:39.460
And there's a 1 over
t in here.

01:12:39.460 --> 01:12:41.140
There's either a 1
over t or a t --

01:12:41.140 --> 01:12:45.820
I'm pretty sure it's a 1 over t,
but I wouldn't swear to it.

01:12:48.950 --> 01:12:51.060
I can't believe I didn't
have that written down.

01:12:51.060 --> 01:12:54.260
At any rate it's in the notes.

01:12:54.260 --> 01:12:56.530
So you will find it there.

01:12:56.530 --> 01:12:59.250
I can't keep these constants
straight.

01:13:03.050 --> 01:13:06.850
I think I did it wherever
I stopped -- here.

01:13:06.850 --> 01:13:08.700
That's where I did it.

01:13:08.700 --> 01:13:11.200
That's the energy equation.

01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:13.640
Yeah, I got it right, amazing.

01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:18.000
The integral of u of t squared
dt is equal to t times the sum

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:19.250
of all the Fourier
coefficients.

01:13:21.900 --> 01:13:23.030
I forgot to say this.

01:13:23.030 --> 01:13:26.850
This is something
I wanted to say.

01:13:26.850 --> 01:13:30.340
This energy equation is
important because in terms of

01:13:30.340 --> 01:13:35.230
source coding, if you take a
function u of t, if you find

01:13:35.230 --> 01:13:40.440
this Fourier series, u of
k, that's a sequence of

01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:41.400
coefficients.

01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:44.780
If we take that sequence of
coefficients and we quantize

01:13:44.780 --> 01:13:51.110
them to some other set of
values, v sub k, and then we

01:13:51.110 --> 01:13:54.710
recreate the function
corresponding to this set up

01:13:54.710 --> 01:13:58.210
Fourier coefficients,
we get sum v of t.

01:13:58.210 --> 01:14:01.240
So we start out with u of t, we
go all the way through all

01:14:01.240 --> 01:14:04.080
of this chain, going through a
channel and everything else,

01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:08.480
come back with some
function v of t.

01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:14.090
This applied to u of t minus
v of t says that the energy

01:14:14.090 --> 01:14:18.690
difference between u of t, and
our re-created version v of t,

01:14:18.690 --> 01:14:23.420
is exactly the same as t times
the sum of the differences

01:14:23.420 --> 01:14:27.230
between u sub k and
v sub k squared.

01:14:27.230 --> 01:14:31.880
Now, that is the reason why most
people talk about mean

01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:37.430
square error most of the time,
because if you can control the

01:14:37.430 --> 01:14:40.740
mean square error on your
coefficients, you're also

01:14:40.740 --> 01:14:44.270
controlling the mean square
error on the functions.

01:14:44.270 --> 01:14:48.820
This formula does not work for
magnitude or cubes or fourth

01:14:48.820 --> 01:14:50.980
powers or anything else.

01:14:50.980 --> 01:14:54.630
It only works for these
square powers.

01:14:54.630 --> 01:14:57.890
That's why everybody uses
mean square error

01:14:57.890 --> 01:15:00.050
rather than other things.

01:15:00.050 --> 01:15:02.700
It also makes sense for energy,
because we believe in,

01:15:02.700 --> 01:15:05.640
in some sense, energy ought
to be important

01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:07.280
and energy is important.

01:15:10.290 --> 01:15:16.480
So, the final part of the
theorem says that finally, if

01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:23.550
you start out with a sequence
of complex numbers and the

01:15:23.550 --> 01:15:28.590
sequence of numbers has finite
energy in this sense, then

01:15:28.590 --> 01:15:32.820
there's an L2 function,
u of t, which

01:15:32.820 --> 01:15:35.690
satisfies all of this stuff.

01:15:35.690 --> 01:15:38.300
In other words, you can go
from function to Fourier

01:15:38.300 --> 01:15:41.430
series, you can go from Fourier
series to function.

01:15:41.430 --> 01:15:42.680
You can go either way.

01:15:45.230 --> 01:15:48.100
So long as you have finite
energy this all works.

01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:53.450
I want to spend just a couple
of minutes talking about the

01:15:53.450 --> 01:15:57.410
difference between Reimann and
Lebesgue integration to show

01:15:57.410 --> 01:16:01.970
you that, in fact, it isn't
really any big deal.

01:16:01.970 --> 01:16:04.020
When you're talking about
Reimann integration --

01:16:04.020 --> 01:16:06.920
I've just showed the integral
for a function

01:16:06.920 --> 01:16:09.810
between zero and 1.

01:16:09.810 --> 01:16:13.740
How do you conceptually find the
integral of a function --

01:16:13.740 --> 01:16:16.160
a Reimann integral, which
is what you're used.

01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:20.640
You split up the interval on
the horizontal axis into a

01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:24.910
bunch of equal intervals
of size 1 over n each.

01:16:24.910 --> 01:16:27.420
So you split it into n
intervals, each one

01:16:27.420 --> 01:16:29.100
a size 1 over n.

01:16:29.100 --> 01:16:32.510
You approximate the value of the
function in each interval

01:16:32.510 --> 01:16:36.950
somehow, as the smallest value,
the largest value, the

01:16:36.950 --> 01:16:39.490
mean value, whatever
you want to do.

01:16:39.490 --> 01:16:42.270
That doesn't make any difference
because as the

01:16:42.270 --> 01:16:46.860
intervals become smaller and
smaller and smaller and you

01:16:46.860 --> 01:16:53.810
have a function which is sort of
smooth in some sense, then

01:16:53.810 --> 01:17:00.220
this Reimann sum here is going
to get close to this interval.

01:17:00.220 --> 01:17:02.820
In other words, the Reimann
sum is going to approach a

01:17:02.820 --> 01:17:06.210
limit, and that limit
is defined

01:17:06.210 --> 01:17:08.630
as the Reimann integral.

01:17:08.630 --> 01:17:10.960
So that's the thing
you're used to.

01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:17.740
The Lebesgue integral is
similar, oh and in a sense,

01:17:17.740 --> 01:17:19.500
it's no more complicated.

01:17:19.500 --> 01:17:23.890
What you do is instead of
quantizing the horizontal axis

01:17:23.890 --> 01:17:27.360
into regions of size 1 over
n and letting 1 over n get

01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:32.220
small, you quantize the vertical
axis into intervals

01:17:32.220 --> 01:17:34.880
of size epsilon and you're
going to let

01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:37.060
epsilon get small later.

01:17:37.060 --> 01:17:40.010
Then the thing that you do is
you ask how much of the

01:17:40.010 --> 01:17:44.000
function is in each of
these intervals here?

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:49.360
So the amount of the function
that lies between 2 epsilon

01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:56.010
and 3 epsilon is an interval
t2 minus t1 -- there's that

01:17:56.010 --> 01:17:59.490
interval where the function
is in this range.

01:17:59.490 --> 01:18:04.290
There's also this interval over
here between t3 and t4.

01:18:04.290 --> 01:18:08.410
So you say the measure of the
function in this interval here

01:18:08.410 --> 01:18:13.970
is t2 minus t1 plus
t4 minus t3.

01:18:13.970 --> 01:18:19.300
You say the measure of the
function in this region here,

01:18:19.300 --> 01:18:26.630
vertical region here, is t1,
namely, this, plus 1 minus t4,

01:18:26.630 --> 01:18:28.560
namely, this region over here.

01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:33.580
So for any function you
can do the same thing.

01:18:33.580 --> 01:18:35.070
That's the Lebesgue integral.

01:18:35.070 --> 01:18:38.560
Lebesgue integral says you
do this and you let these

01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:42.570
epsilons get very small and
you just add them up.

01:18:47.940 --> 01:18:51.770
Let me say just -- last slide.

01:18:51.770 --> 01:18:55.000
Turns out that whenever the
Reimann integral exists,

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:58.650
namely, that limit exists, the
Lebesgue interval also exists

01:18:58.650 --> 01:19:01.990
and has the same value.

01:19:01.990 --> 01:19:05.000
All of the familiar rules for
calculating Reimann integrals

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:08.290
also apply for Lebesgue
integrals.

01:19:08.290 --> 01:19:11.190
For some very weird functions,
the Lebesgue integral exists,

01:19:11.190 --> 01:19:14.310
but the Reimann integral
doesn't exist.

01:19:14.310 --> 01:19:17.480
For some extraordinarily weird
functions, there aren't even

01:19:17.480 --> 01:19:18.740
any examples in the notes.

01:19:18.740 --> 01:19:22.770
I couldn't find an example which
I thought was palatable,

01:19:22.770 --> 01:19:24.930
not even the Lebesgue
integral exists.

01:19:24.930 --> 01:19:27.120
So the Lebesgue integral is
much more general than the

01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:29.100
Reimann integral.

01:19:29.100 --> 01:19:34.960
But the nice thing is you can
almost forget about it because

01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:39.220
everything you know to do still
works, it's just that

01:19:39.220 --> 01:19:42.830
some of the things that didn't
work before now work.

01:19:42.830 --> 01:19:46.520
Because those things that didn't
work before now work,

01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:51.160
your theorems can be much more
general than they were before.

01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:53.570
We'll talk more about
that next time.

01:19:53.570 --> 01:19:55.960
This material we're talking
about right now is in the

01:19:55.960 --> 01:20:00.180
appendix to the lectures that
just got passed out.
