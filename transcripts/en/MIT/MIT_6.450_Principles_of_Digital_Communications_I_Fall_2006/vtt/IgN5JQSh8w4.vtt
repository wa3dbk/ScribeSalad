00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:26.450
PROFESSOR: The AEP is probably
one of the most difficult

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.640
concepts we talk about
in this course.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.370
It seems simple to start with.

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:34.870
As I said before, it's one of
those things where you think

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.930
you understand it, and
then you think you

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.240
don't understand it.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.120
When Shannon first came out with
this theory, there were a

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.670
lot of very, very good
professional mathematicians

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.080
who spent a long time trying
to understand this.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.920
And who, in fact, blew it.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.330
Because, in fact, they were
trying to look at it strictly

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.930
in terms of mathematics.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.900
They were looking for strict
mathematical theorems, they

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.590
weren't looking to try to
get the insight from it.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.560
Because of that they
couldn't absorb it.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.720
There were a lot of engineers
who looked at it, and couldn't

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.690
absorb it because they couldn't
match it with any of

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.990
the mathematics, and therefore
they started thinking there

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.530
was more there then there really
was so, so this is, in

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:16.760
fact, tricky.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:24.820
What we're looking at is a
sequence of chance variables

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.920
coming from a discrete
memoryless source.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.650
In other words, a discrete
memoryless source is something

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.520
that spits out symbols and each
symbol is independent of

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.810
each other symbol, each symbol
has the same probability mass

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.820
function as every
other symbol.

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.380
We said it's a neat thing to
look at this log pmf random

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.260
variable, and a log pmf random
variable is minus log of the

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.550
probability of the particular
symbol.

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.120
So we have a sequence now
of random variables.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.430
And the expected value of that
random variable, for each of

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:12.280
the random variables, is the
expected value of the log pmf

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.140
which is, as we said before, is
this thing we've called the

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.240
entropy, which we're trying
to get some insight into.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.550
So we have this log pmf random
variable, we have the entropy,

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.970
which is the expected
value of it.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.790
We then talked about
the sequence of

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.540
these random variables.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.990
We talked about the sample
average of them, and the whole

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.930
reason you want to look at this
random variable is the

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:40.440
sample average of a lot of these
pmf's, since logs add

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.870
when the thing you're taking
the log of multiplies.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.870
What you wind up with is the sum
of these log pmf's is, in

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.930
fact, equal to minus the lof
of the probability of the

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:54.840
whole sequence.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.200
In other words, you look at this
whole sequence as a big,

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:05.600
giant chance variable, which
has capital X to the n

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.100
different possible values.

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.840
Namely, every possible
sequence of length n.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.420
When you're talking about source
coding, you have to

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.680
find the code word for
each of those m to

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.950
the n different sequences.

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.260
So what you're doing here
is trying to look at the

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.130
probability of each of those
m to the n sequences.

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.130
We can then use Huffman coding,
or whatever we choose

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.560
to use, to try to encode
those things.

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.910
OK, the weak law of large
numbers applies here, and says

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:46.450
that the probability that this
sample average of the log pmf

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.840
is close to the expected
value of the log pmf.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.370
The probability that that's
greater than or equal to

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.770
epsilon is less than or equal to
the variance of the log pmf

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:02.850
random variable, divided by
n times epsilon squared.

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:08.090
Now, we are going to take the
viewpoint that n epsilon

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.860
squared, is very small.

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.440
Excuse me, it's very large.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.970
Epsilon we're thinking as a
small number, and we're

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.680
thinking of as a large number,
but the game we always play

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:25.790
here is to first pick some
epsilong, as small as you want

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:30.640
to make it, and then you make
n larger and larger.

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:34.640
And as n gets bigger and bigger,
eventually this number

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:35.850
gets very small.

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:37.970
So that's the game that
we're playing.

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:41.070
It's y n times epsilon squared,
we're thinking of it

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:42.350
is a large number.

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:47.590
So what this says is the
probability that this log pmf

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:52.600
of the entire sequence, well the
sample value of it, namely

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:57.780
the log pmf divided by n,
us close to H of X. The

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:02.220
probability of that is less
than or equal to this.

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.180
We then define the typical
set, T sub epsilon of n.

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:11.240
This is the set of all typical
sequences out of the source.

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.120
So we're defining typical
sequences in this way.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.000
It's a set of all sequences
which are

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.560
what we put into there.

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.510
Well, it's what we put into
there, but we're looking at

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:24.340
the compliment of this set.

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:26.880
These are the exceptional
things.

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.790
These are the typical things.

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:32.470
We're saying that the
exceptional things here have a

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:35.650
small probability when you
make n big enough.

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:39.070
This is saying that the
exceptional things don't

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:42.680
amount to anything, and the
typical things fill up the

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.840
entire probability space.

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:49.880
So what were saying is the
probability that this sequence

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:54.150
is actually typical is greater
than or equal to 1 minus

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:55.490
something small.

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:00.940
It says when n gets big enough
the probability that you get a

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:04.230
typical sequence out of the
source is going to wan.

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:08.900
OK.

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.660
We drew this in terms of a
probability distribution,

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:16.530
which I hope makes things look a
little more straightforward.

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:20.770
This is the distribution
function of the sample average

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:23.320
of this log pmf random
variable.

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:28.210
And what we're saying is that
as n gets larger and larger,

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:30.950
the thing that's going to happen
because of the fact

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:35.860
that the variance of the sample
average -- the sample

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:38.230
average is always a
random variable.

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:42.270
The average is not a random
variable, it's a fixed number.

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:45.150
And what this is saying is
that as n gets larger and

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:49.560
larger, this distribution
function here gets closer and

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.530
closer to a stack.

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:55.750
In other words, the thing that's
happening is that as n

00:06:55.750 --> 00:07:00.580
gets big, you go along here,
nothing happens suddenly you

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:04.450
move up here and suddenly
you move across there.

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:07.270
That's what happens in the
limit, mainly the sample

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:13.050
average is, at that point,
always equal to the average.

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:15.550
So as n goes to infinity,
a typical set approaches

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:17.170
probability 1.

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:20.740
We express that in terms of the
Chebyshev inequality in

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:24.650
this way, but the picture says
you can interpret it in any

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:26.890
one of a hundred
different ways.

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:29.760
Because the real essence of
this is not the Chebyshev

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:33.970
inequality, the real essence of
it is saying that as n gets

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:35.900
bigger and bigger,
this distribution

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:37.950
function becomes a stack.

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:39.970
So that's a nice way of
thinking about it.

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:46.570
Let's summarized what
we did with that.

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:50.350
All of the major results
about typical sets.

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:53.170
The first of them,
is this one.

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:56.430
It's a bound on the number of
elements in a typical set, I'm

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:59.260
not going to rederive that
again, but it comes from

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.740
looking at the fact that all of
the typical elements have

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:05.790
roughly the same probability.

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:08.880
All of them collectively fill
up the whole space, and

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:11.760
therefore you can find the
probability of each of them by

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:14.960
taking one and dividing by the
probability of each of them.

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:17.140
When you do that, you
get two bounds.

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:20.960
One of them says that this
magnitude is less than 2 to

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:23.380
the n times H of
X plus epsilon.

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:27.250
The other one says it's greater
than 2 to the n H of X

00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:28.380
minus epsilon.

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:31.130
And you have to throw in this
little fudge factor here

00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:34.060
because of the fact that the
typical set doesn't quite fill

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:36.490
up the whole space.

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:39.770
What that all says is when n
gets large the number of

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:43.000
typical elements is
approximately equal to 2 to

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.990
the n times H of X.
Again, think hard

00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:48.990
about what this means.

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:54.530
This number here really isn't
all like 2 to the n H of X.

00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:58.770
This n times epsilon, is going
to be a big number.

00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:02.610
As n gets bigger, it gets
bigger and bigger.

00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:06.140
But, at the same time, when you
look at 2 to the n times H

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:10.090
of X plus epsilon, and you know
that H of X is something

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:14.720
substantial and you know that
epsilon is very small, in some

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:17.600
sense it still says this.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:20.750
And in source coding terms,
it very much says this.

00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:23.050
Because in source coding terms,
what you're always

00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:25.070
looking at is these exponents.

00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:29.060
Because if you have n different
things you're trying

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:32.940
to encode, it takes you log
of n bits to encode them.

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:35.890
So when you take the log of
this, you see that the number

00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:39.720
of extra bits you needs to
encode these sequences is on

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:42.030
the order of n times epsilon.

00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:45.250
Which is some number of bits,
but the real number bits

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:49.110
you're looking at is n times
H of X. So that's the major

00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:52.030
term, and this is just fiddly.

00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:54.630
The next thing we found is that
the probability of an

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:58.400
element in a typical set is
between 2 the minus n times H

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:01.280
of X plus epsilon and 2
to the minus n times

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:02.760
H of X minus epsilon.

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:07.180
Which is saying almost the same
thing as this is saying.

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:11.940
And again, there's this
approximation which says this

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:16.130
is about equal to 2 to the minus
n of H of X. And this is

00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:19.620
an approximation in exactly the
same sense that that's an

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:21.440
approximation.

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:25.300
Finally, the last statement is
that the probability that

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:27.890
this typical --

00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:31.490
the probability that you get a
typical sequence is greater

00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:35.140
than or equal to 1 minus this
variance divided by n times

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:38.740
epsilon squared, with the same
kind of approximation.

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:41.250
The probability that
you get the typical

00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:44.090
sequence is about 1.

00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:46.600
So what this is saying is
there are hardly any

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.840
exceptions in terms
of probability.

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:51.120
There are a huge number
of exceptions.

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:52.970
But they're all extraordinarily
small in

00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:55.830
probability.

00:10:55.830 --> 00:11:00.440
So most of the space is all
tucked into this typical set.

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:03.910
Most of these, all of these
typical sequences, have about

00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:05.700
the same probability.

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:09.030
And the number of typical
sequences is about 2 to the n

00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:11.450
times H of X.

00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:14.900
Does that say that the entropy
has any significance?

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:17.020
It sure does.

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:20.060
Because the entropy is really
what's determining everything

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:22.270
about this distribution,
as far as

00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:24.480
probabilities are concerned.

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:26.600
There's nothing left
beyond that.

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:29.250
If you're going to look at very
long sequences, and in

00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:30.950
source coding we want
to look at long

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:34.460
sequences, that's the story.

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:37.720
So the entropy tells a story.

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:40.470
Despite what Huffman said.

00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:45.370
Huffman totally ignored the idea
of entropy and because of

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:48.140
that he came up with the optimal
algorithm, but his

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:50.450
optimal algorithm didn't
tell him anything about

00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:51.890
what was going on.

00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:52.710
This is not the [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:58.260
Huffman, I think his algorithm
is one of the neatest things

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.090
I've ever seen, because
he came up

00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:01.390
with it out of nowhere.

00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:04.070
Just pure thought,
which is nice.

00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:06.810
We then start to talk about
fixed lenght to fized length

00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:08.120
source coding.

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:10.140
This is not a practical thing.

00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:14.230
This is not something I would
advise trying to do.

00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:17.560
It's something which is
conceptually useful, because

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:21.910
it's talks about anything you
can do eventually, when you

00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:25.280
look at an almost infinite
sequence of symbols from the

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:28.150
source and you look at how
many bits it takes you to

00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:30.310
represent them.

00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:35.000
Ultimately you need to turn that
encoder on, at some point

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.700
in pre-history, and pre-history
in our present day

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:40.660
is about one year ago.

00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:43.440
And you have to turn it off
sometime in the distant

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:47.300
future, which is maybe
six months from now.

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:50.770
During that time you have to
encode all these bits.

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:53.160
So, in fact, when you get it
all done and look at the

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:57.870
overall picture, it's fixed
length to fixed length.

00:12:57.870 --> 00:13:00.560
And all of these algorithms
are just ways of doing the

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:04.200
fixed length to fixed length
without too much delay

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:06.890
involved in them.

00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:14.350
I didn't say everything there.

00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:19.280
What this typical set picture
gives us there, is you can

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:23.640
achieve an expected number of
bits per source symbol, which

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:27.990
is about n times H of X, with
very rare failures.

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:32.190
And if you try to achieve H of
X minus epsilon bits per

00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:36.220
symbol, the interesting thing
we found last time, was that

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:42.950
the fraction of sequences you
can encode was zilch.

00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:45.730
In other words, there is a very
rapid transition here.

00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:51.320
If you try to get by with too
few bits per symbol, you die

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:53.250
very, very quickly.

00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:55.910
It's not that your error
probability is large, your

00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:59.400
error probability is
asymptotically equal to 1.

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:02.190
You always screw up.

00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:07.890
So that's the picture.

00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:09.740
We want to go onto
Markow sources.

00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:13.080
Let me explain why I want
to do this first.

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:19.100
When we're talking about the
discrete memoryless sources,

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:24.530
it should be obvious that that's
totally a toy problem.

00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:28.180
There aren't any sources I can
imagine where you would want

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:32.640
to encode their output where
you can reasonably conclude

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:34.760
that they were discrete
and memoryless.

00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:37.040
Namely, that each symbol
was independent

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:38.250
of each other symbol.

00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:41.060
The only possibility I can
think of is where you're

00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:44.890
trying to report the results
of gambling or something.

00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:47.250
And gambling is so dishonest
that they probably aren't

00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:49.690
independent anyway.

00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:51.730
You could use this is a way
of showing they aren't

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:55.970
independent, but it's not
a very useful thing.

00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:59.300
So somehow we want to be able
to talk about how do you

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:01.450
encode sources with memory.

00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:04.860
Well Markow sources are
the easiest kind of

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:06.640
sources with memory.

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:10.260
And they have the nice property
that you can include

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:13.010
as much statistics in
them as you want to.

00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:16.710
You can make them include as
much of the structure you can

00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:21.430
find as anything else will do.

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:24.290
So that people talk about much
more general classes of

00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:27.130
sources, but these are
really sufficient.

00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:30.060
These are sufficient to talk
about everything useful.

00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:34.060
Not necessarily the nicest way
to think about useful things

00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:35.990
but it's sufficient.

00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:38.590
So a finite state in Markov
chain, I assume you're

00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:41.690
somewhat familiar with Markov
chaings from taking a

00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:43.800
probability courses.

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:46.820
If not, you should probably
review it there, because the

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:49.150
notes go through it
pretty quickly.

00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:51.570
There's nothing terribly
complicated there, but a

00:15:51.570 --> 00:15:55.820
finite state in a Markov chain
is a sequence of discrete

00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:59.900
chance variables, in that sense
it's exactly like the

00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:02.700
discrete memoryless sources
we were looking at.

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:06.210
The letters come from some
finite alphabet, so in that

00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:10.590
sense it's like the discrete
memoryless sources.

00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:16.740
But here the difference is that
each letter depends on

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:18.920
the letter before.

00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:23.580
Namely, before the Markov chain
changes from one state

00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:27.040
to another state in one of these
steps, it looks at the

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:31.580
state it's in and decides where
it's going to go next.

00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:36.960
So we have a transition
probability matrix, you can

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:39.260
think of this as a matrix,
it's something which has

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:43.350
values for every S in the state
space, and for everys S

00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:45.980
prime in the state space.

00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:49.800
Which represents the probability
that the state at

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:54.400
time n is equal the this state
S, and the state of time n

00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:59.000
minus 1 is equal to the
states S prime.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.080
So this tells you what's the
probabilities are of going

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:04.070
from one state to another.

00:17:04.070 --> 00:17:09.440
The important thing here is
that this single step

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:14.340
transition incorporates all of
the statistical knowledge.

00:17:14.340 --> 00:17:18.600
In other words, this is also
equal to the probability that

00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:23.490
S n is equal to this state S,
given that S n minus 1 is

00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:28.120
equal to the state S prime, and
also that S n minus 2 is

00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:32.360
equal to any given state of time
n minus 2, and all the

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:37.650
way back to S minus zero being
any old state at time S zero.

00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:42.330
So it says that this source
loses memory, except for the

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:44.370
first thing back.

00:17:44.370 --> 00:17:48.270
I like to think of this as a
blind frog who has very good

00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:52.360
sensory perception, jumping
around on lily pads.

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:55.250
In other words, he can't see
the lily pad, he can only

00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:57.530
sense the nearby lily pads.

00:17:57.530 --> 00:18:00.550
So he jumps from one lily pad
to the next and when he gets

00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:03.960
to the next lily pad, he then
decides which lily pad he's

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:05.740
going go to go to next.

00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:11.500
That'll wake you up, anyway.

00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:20.120
And we also want to define
some initial pmf on the

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:21.250
initial state.

00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:24.350
So you like to think of Markov
chains as starting at some

00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:27.880
time and then proceeding forever
into the future.

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:34.990
That seems to indicate that all
we've done is to replace

00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:38.240
one trivial problem with another
trivial problem.

00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:42.020
In other words, on step memory
is not enough to deal with

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:45.590
things like English text
and things like that.

00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:48.960
Or any other language
that you like.

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:55.630
So the idea of a Markov source
is that you create whatever

00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:58.780
set of states that you want,
you can have a very large

00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:04.480
state space, but you associate
the output of the source not

00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:07.140
with the states, but with
the transitions from

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:09.750
one state to another.

00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:12.840
So this gives an example of it,
it's easier to explain the

00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:17.370
idea by simply looking
at an example.

00:19:17.370 --> 00:19:20.090
In this particular example,
which I think is the same as

00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:25.300
the one in the notes, what
you're looking at is a memory

00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:27.520
of the two previous states.

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:30.590
So this is a binary source, it
produces binary digits, just

00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:32.930
either zero or 1.

00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:38.190
If the previous two digits were
zero zero, it says that

00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:43.240
the next digit is going to be
a 1 with probability 0.1 and

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:47.910
the next is going to be a zero
with probability 0.9.

00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:53.280
If you're in states 0,0 and the
next thing that comes out

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:57.490
is a zero, then at that point,
namely at that point one

00:19:57.490 --> 00:20:01.180
advanced into the future, you
have a zero as your last

00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:04.460
digit, a zero as a previous
digit, and a zero as the digit

00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:05.530
before that.

00:20:05.530 --> 00:20:15.020
So your state has move from xn
minus 2 and xn minus 1, to xn

00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:19.420
minus 1 and xn.

00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:23.830
In other words, any time you
make a transition, this digit

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:28.290
here, which is the previous
digit, has to always become

00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:30.590
that digit.

00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:32.500
You'll notice the same thing
in all of these.

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:37.750
When you go from here to there,
this last digit becomes

00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:38.940
the first digit.

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:43.380
When you go from here to here,
the last digit because the

00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:45.320
first digit, and so forth.

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:48.970
And that's a characteristic of
this particular structure of

00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:53.640
having the memory represented
by the last two digits.

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:56.730
So the kind of output you can
get from this source --

00:20:56.730 --> 00:21:01.300
I mean you see that it doesn't
do anything very interesting.

00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:05.040
When you have two zeroes in the
past, it tends to produce

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:09.640
a lot more zeroes, it tends to
get stuck with lots of zeroes.

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:14.240
If you got a single 1 that goes
over into this state, and

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:18.540
from there it can either
go there or there.

00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:22.390
Once it gets here, it tends to
produce a large number of 1's.

00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:25.660
So what's happening here is you
have a Markov chain which

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:29.530
goes from long sequences of
zeroes, to transition regions

00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:32.210
where there are a bunch of zeros
and 1's, and finally

00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:35.640
gets trapped into either the all
zero state again, or the

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:38.300
all 1 state again.

00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:40.350
And moves on from there.

00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:47.460
So the letter is what's in this
case the source output.

00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:50.825
If you know the old state, the
source output specifies in

00:21:50.825 --> 00:21:51.980
this state.

00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:55.730
If you know the old state and
the new state, that specifies

00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:56.170
the letter.

00:21:56.170 --> 00:21:58.290
In other words, one of the
curious things about this

00:21:58.290 --> 00:22:02.410
chain is I've arranged it so
that, since we have a binary

00:22:02.410 --> 00:22:04.560
output, they're only
two possible

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:07.390
transitions from each state.

00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:11.840
Which says that the state plus
the sequence of source outputs

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:15.970
specifies the state at every
point in time, the stayed at

00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:19.490
every point in time specifies
the source sequence.

00:22:19.490 --> 00:22:22.490
In other words, the two are
isomorphic to each other.

00:22:22.490 --> 00:22:23.920
One specifies the other.

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:28.240
Since one specifies the other,
you can pretty much forget

00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:32.010
about the sequence and
look at the state

00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:33.890
chain, if you want to.

00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:36.470
And therefore everything you
know about Markov chains is

00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:38.180
useful here.

00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:40.650
Or if you like to think about
the real source, you can think

00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:43.580
about the real source as
producing these letters.

00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:46.040
So either way is fine
because either one

00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:47.270
specifies the other.

00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:51.140
When you don't have that
property, and you look at a

00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:55.420
sequence of letters from this
source, these are called

00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:58.710
partially specified
Markov chains.

00:22:58.710 --> 00:23:01.680
And they're awful things
to deal with.

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:04.940
You can write theses about, but
you don't get any insight

00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:05.910
about them.

00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:08.140
There's hardly anything that
you would like to be true

00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:10.540
which is true.

00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:14.890
And these are just awful
things to look at.

00:23:14.890 --> 00:23:16.710
So we won't look them.

00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:19.800
One of the nice things about
engineering is you can create

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:21.370
your own models.

00:23:21.370 --> 00:23:24.420
Mathematicians have to look
at the crazy models that

00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:26.400
engineers suggest to them.

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:28.230
They have no choice.

00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:29.620
That's their job.

00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:33.760
But as an engineer, we can only
look at the nice models.

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:36.160
We can play and the
mathematicians have to work.

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:41.650
So it's nicer to be an
engineer, I think.

00:23:41.650 --> 00:23:45.150
Although famous mathematicians
only look at the engineering

00:23:45.150 --> 00:23:48.870
problems that appeal to them,
so in fact, when they become

00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:53.130
famous the two groups come
back together again.

00:23:53.130 --> 00:23:56.100
Because the good engineers are
also good mathematician, so

00:23:56.100 --> 00:24:00.450
they become sort of
the same group.

00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:05.950
These transitions, mainly the
transition lines that we draw

00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:09.860
on a graph like this, always
indicate positive probability.

00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:12.540
In other words, that there's
zero probability from going to

00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:13.550
here to here.

00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:17.090
You don't clutter up the diagram
by putting a line in,

00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:20.650
which allows you to just look at
these transitions to figure

00:24:20.650 --> 00:24:23.810
out what's going on.

00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:27.490
One of the things that you
learned when you study finite

00:24:27.490 --> 00:24:33.730
state Markov chains, is that a
state s is accessible from

00:24:33.730 --> 00:24:38.130
some other state s prime, if the
graph has some path from s

00:24:38.130 --> 00:24:39.360
prime to s.

00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:40.920
In other words, it's not
saying you can go

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:42.450
there in one step.

00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:45.740
It's saying that there's some
way you can get there if you

00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:47.060
go long enough.

00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:50.630
Which means there's some
probability of getting there.

00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:54.490
And the fact that there's a
probability of getting there

00:24:54.490 --> 00:24:58.930
pretty much means that you're
going to get there eventually.

00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:02.200
That's not an obvious statement
but let's see what

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:04.330
that means here.

00:25:04.330 --> 00:25:08.210
This state is accessible from
this state, in the sense that

00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:12.840
you can get from here to there
by going over here and then

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:15.890
going to here.

00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:19.490
If we look at the states which
are accessible from each

00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:23.640
other, you get some set of
states, and if you're in that

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:26.430
set of states, you can
never get out of it.

00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:30.290
Therefore, every one of those
states remains with positive

00:25:30.290 --> 00:25:33.680
probability and you keep
rotating back and forth

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:38.950
between them in some way, but
you never get out of them.

00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:43.480
In other words, a Markov chain
which doesn't have this

00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:46.700
property would be the following
Markov chain.

00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:51.880
That's the simplest one
I can think of.

00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:54.440
If you start out in this
state you stay there.

00:25:54.440 --> 00:26:00.100
If you start out in this state,
you stay there, That's

00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:01.930
not a very nice chain.

00:26:01.930 --> 00:26:05.390
Is this a decent model for
an engineering study?

00:26:05.390 --> 00:26:08.050
No.

00:26:08.050 --> 00:26:11.120
Because when you're looking at
engineering, the thing that

00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:13.410
you're interested in, is you're
looking at something

00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:16.240
that happens over a long
period of time.

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:19.640
Back at time infinity you can
decide whether you're here, or

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:24.940
whether you're here, and you
might as well not worry a

00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:29.500
whole lot about what happened
back at time minus infinity,

00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:30.800
as far as building your model.

00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:33.550
You may as well just build a
model for this, or build a

00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:35.540
model for that.

00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:39.030
There's another thing here,
which is periodicity.

00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:45.980
In some chains, you can go from
this state to this state

00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:49.320
in one step, well
one, two steps.

00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:54.350
Or you can go there in one,
two, three, four steps.

00:26:54.350 --> 00:27:00.650
Or you can go there in one, two,
three steps and so forth.

00:27:00.650 --> 00:27:05.690
Which says, in terms of m the
period of s is the greatest

00:27:05.690 --> 00:27:08.420
common denominator
of path lengths

00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:11.250
from s back to s again.

00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:16.850
If that period is equal to 1,
mainly if there's not some

00:27:16.850 --> 00:27:20.210
periodic structure which says
the only way you can get back

00:27:20.210 --> 00:27:27.000
to a state is by coming back
every two steps or every three

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.100
steps or something, then
again it's not a

00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:31.400
very nice Markov chain.

00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:36.060
Because if you're modeling it,
you might as well just model

00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:40.520
things over two states instead
of over single states.

00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:45.510
So the upshot of that is you
define these nice Markov

00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:49.790
chains, which are aperiodic,
which don't have any of this

00:27:49.790 --> 00:27:53.470
periodic structure, and every
state is accessible from every

00:27:53.470 --> 00:27:54.730
other state.

00:27:54.730 --> 00:27:58.790
And you call them ergodic
Markov chains.

00:27:58.790 --> 00:28:04.600
And what ergodic means, sort
of and as a more general

00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:15.140
principle, is that the
probabilities of things are

00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:17.180
equal to the relative
frequency of things.

00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:20.210
Namely, if you look at a very
long sequence of things out of

00:28:20.210 --> 00:28:24.130
a Markov chain, what you see
in that very long sequence

00:28:24.130 --> 00:28:28.420
should be representative of the
probabilities of that very

00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:29.270
long sequence.

00:28:29.270 --> 00:28:32.230
The probabilities of transitions
at various times

00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:35.380
should be the same from
one time to another.

00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:37.050
And that's whate ergodicity
means.

00:28:37.050 --> 00:28:39.030
It means that the thing
is stationery.

00:28:39.030 --> 00:28:42.080
You look at it at one time, it
behaves the same way as at

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:43.010
another time.

00:28:43.010 --> 00:28:45.820
It doesn't have any periodic
structure, which means if you

00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:49.110
look at it at even times, it
behaves differently from

00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:51.310
looking at it at odd times.

00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:53.920
That's the kind of Markov chain
you would think you

00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:56.890
would have, unless you look at
these odd ball examples of

00:28:56.890 --> 00:28:57.920
other things.

00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:01.170
Everything we do is going to
be based on the idea of

00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:03.580
ergodic Markov chains,
because they're the

00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:06.020
nicest models to use.

00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:09.250
A Markov source then is
a sequence of labeled

00:29:09.250 --> 00:29:12.340
transitions on an and ergodic
Markov chain.

00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:14.530
Those are the only things
we want to look at.

00:29:14.530 --> 00:29:16.350
But that's general enough
to do most of the

00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:17.600
things we want to do.

00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:24.470
And once you have ergodic Markov
chains, there are a lot

00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:25.870
of nice things that happen.

00:29:29.690 --> 00:29:38.460
Mainly, if you try to solve this
set of equations, namely

00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:42.480
if you want to say, well suppose
there is some pmf

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:45.090
function which gives
me the relative

00:29:45.090 --> 00:29:47.850
frequency of a given state.

00:29:47.850 --> 00:29:51.470
Namely, if I look at an enormous
number of states, I

00:29:51.470 --> 00:29:57.800
would like the state little
s to come up with

00:29:57.800 --> 00:29:59.460
some relative frequency.

00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:01.400
All the time that I do it.

00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:05.610
Namely, I wouldn't like to have
one sample path which

00:30:05.610 --> 00:30:08.750
comes up with a relative
frequency 1/2, and another

00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:12.050
sample path of almost infinite
length which comes up with a

00:30:12.050 --> 00:30:13.480
different relative frequency.

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:17.720
Because it would mean that
different sequences of states

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:21.610
are not typical of
the Markov chain.

00:30:21.610 --> 00:30:26.460
That's another way of looking
at what ergodicity means.

00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:29.270
It means that infinite
length sequences

00:30:29.270 --> 00:30:31.670
are not typical anymore.

00:30:31.670 --> 00:30:36.020
It depends on when they
start, when they stop.

00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:38.020
It depends on whether
you start at an even

00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:39.560
time or an odd time.

00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:43.920
Depends on all of these things,
that -- all of these

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:47.250
things that real sources
shouldn't depend on.

00:30:47.250 --> 00:30:51.220
So, if you have relative
frequencies then you should

00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:54.390
have those relative frequencies
at time n and at

00:30:54.390 --> 00:30:56.020
time n minus 1.

00:30:56.020 --> 00:31:02.030
And probability of a particular
symbol s, if the

00:31:02.030 --> 00:31:05.890
probabilities of the previous
symbol s prime were the same

00:31:05.890 --> 00:31:07.590
values, q of s prime.

00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:10.390
We know the transition
probabilities, that's q of s

00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:11.880
given s prime.

00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:18.440
The sum over s prime, of q of s
prime, given capital Q of s

00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:20.530
given s prime, what is that?

00:31:20.530 --> 00:31:24.340
That's the probability of x.

00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:27.970
In other words, if you start
out at time n minus 1 with

00:31:27.970 --> 00:31:33.100
something pmf function on the
states at time n minus 1, this

00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:37.180
is the formula you would use to
calculate the probability

00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:42.560
the pmf function for
states at time s.

00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:47.120
This is the probability mass
function for the states at the

00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:50.640
next unit of time, time n.

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:53.130
If this probability distribution
is the same as

00:31:53.130 --> 00:31:57.380
this probability distribution,
then you say that you're in

00:31:57.380 --> 00:32:00.970
steady state, because you do
this again, you plug this into

00:32:00.970 --> 00:32:02.410
here, it's the same thing.

00:32:02.410 --> 00:32:05.070
You get the same answer
at time n plus 1.

00:32:05.070 --> 00:32:08.350
You plug it in again you got the
same answer at time n plus

00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:10.860
2, and so on forever.

00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:14.250
So you stay in steady state.

00:32:14.250 --> 00:32:18.540
The question is, if you have a
matrix here, can you solve

00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:20.400
this equation?

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:23.030
Is it easy to solve?

00:32:23.030 --> 00:32:25.840
And what's the solution?

00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:29.590
There's a nice theorem that
says, if the chain is ergodic,

00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:33.000
namely if it has these nice
properties of transition

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.860
probabilities, that corresponds
to a particular

00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:37.340
kind of matrix here.

00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:41.790
If you have that kind of matrix,
this is just a vector

00:32:41.790 --> 00:32:44.440
matrix equation.

00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:49.230
That vector matrix equation has
a unique solution then for

00:32:49.230 --> 00:32:54.550
this probability little q, in
terms of this transition

00:32:54.550 --> 00:32:55.590
probability.

00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:59.230
It also has the nice property
that if you start out with any

00:32:59.230 --> 00:33:02.790
old distribution, and you grind
this thing away for a

00:33:02.790 --> 00:33:08.840
number of times, this q of x
is going to approach the

00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:10.170
steady state solution.

00:33:10.170 --> 00:33:14.090
Which means if you start a
Markov chain out in some known

00:33:14.090 --> 00:33:18.580
state, after awhile the
probability that you're in

00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:22.190
state s is going to become this
steady state probability.

00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:25.220
It gets closer and closer
to it exponentially

00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:27.730
as time goes on.

00:33:27.730 --> 00:33:31.170
So that's just arithmetic.

00:33:31.170 --> 00:33:33.520
These steady state probabilities
are approached

00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:37.380
asymptotically from any starting
state, i.e. for all s

00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:38.790
and s prime and s.

00:33:38.790 --> 00:33:42.260
The limit of the probability
that s sub n, the state at

00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:46.320
time n, is equal to a given
state s, given that the state

00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:49.020
at time zero was equal
to s prime.

00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:53.370
This probability is equal to q
of s and the limit as n goes

00:33:53.370 --> 00:33:54.990
to infinity.

00:33:54.990 --> 00:33:57.770
All of you know those things
from studying Markov chains.

00:33:57.770 --> 00:34:01.670
I hope, because those
are the main facts

00:34:01.670 --> 00:34:03.870
about Markov chains.

00:34:03.870 --> 00:34:05.190
Incidentally I'm not
interested in

00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:07.220
Markov chains here.

00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:10.630
We're not going to do anything
with them, the only thing I

00:34:10.630 --> 00:34:14.700
want to do with them is to show
you that there are ways

00:34:14.700 --> 00:34:18.490
of modeling real sources, and
coming as close to good models

00:34:18.490 --> 00:34:22.480
for real sources as
you want to come.

00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:24.550
That's the whole
approach here.

00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:28.770
How do you do coding
for Markov sources?

00:34:28.770 --> 00:34:33.500
The simplest approach, which
doesn't work very well, is to

00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:37.590
use a separate prefix-free code
for each prior state.

00:34:37.590 --> 00:34:47.225
Namely, if I look at this Markov
chain that I had, it

00:34:47.225 --> 00:34:51.220
says that when I'm in the state
I want to somehow encode

00:34:51.220 --> 00:34:53.930
the next state that I go to, or
the next letter that comes

00:34:53.930 --> 00:34:55.470
out of the Markov source.

00:34:55.470 --> 00:34:57.810
The things that can come out
of the Markov source are

00:34:57.810 --> 00:35:01.530
either a 1 or a zero.

00:35:01.530 --> 00:35:04.130
Now you see the whole problem
with this approach.

00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:07.870
As soon as you look at an
example, it sort of blows the

00:35:07.870 --> 00:35:09.990
cover on this.

00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:15.340
What's the best prefix-free code
to encode a 1 and a zero?

00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:17.840
Where one appears with
probability 0.9 and the other

00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:20.480
one appears with probability
0.1.

00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:24.200
What's the Huffman encoder do?

00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:27.640
It assigns one of those symols
to 1 and one of them to zero.

00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:30.390
You might as well encode
1 to this one, and

00:35:30.390 --> 00:35:31.710
zero to that one.

00:35:31.710 --> 00:35:38.260
Which means that all of the
theory, all it does is

00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:40.850
generate the same symbols
that you had before.

00:35:40.850 --> 00:35:44.040
You're not doing any
compression at all.

00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:45.400
It's a nice thing
to think about.

00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:50.300
In other words, by thinking
about these things you then

00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:51.660
see the solution.

00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:55.740
And our solution before to these
problems was that if you

00:35:55.740 --> 00:36:00.170
don't get anywhere by using a
prefix-free code on a single

00:36:00.170 --> 00:36:03.230
digit, take a block of n digits
and use a prefix-free

00:36:03.230 --> 00:36:04.530
code there.

00:36:04.530 --> 00:36:08.240
So that's the approach
we will take here.

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:13.300
The general idea for single
letters is this prefix-free

00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:17.330
code we're going to generate
satisfies a Kraft inequality,

00:36:17.330 --> 00:36:19.980
you can use the Huffman
algorithm, you get this

00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:21.970
property here.

00:36:21.970 --> 00:36:27.940
And this entropy, which is now
a function of the particular

00:36:27.940 --> 00:36:31.330
state that we were in to
start with, is just

00:36:31.330 --> 00:36:32.770
this entropy here.

00:36:32.770 --> 00:36:36.540
So this is a conditional
entropy, which we get a

00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:38.530
different conditional
entropy for each

00:36:38.530 --> 00:36:40.320
possible previous state.

00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:43.250
And that conditional entropy
for each possible previous

00:36:43.250 --> 00:36:47.580
state, is what tells us exactly
what we can do as far

00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:50.320
as generating a Huffman code
for that next state.

00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:53.630
This would work fine if you had
a symbol alphabet of size

00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:55.730
10,000 or something.

00:36:55.730 --> 00:36:57.080
It just doesn't work
well when your

00:36:57.080 --> 00:36:58.660
symbol alphabet is binary.

00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:12.480
If we start out in a steady
state, then all of these

00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:16.420
probability stay in
steady state.

00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:20.840
When we look at the number of
binary digits per source

00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:24.280
symbol and we average them
over all of the initial

00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:26.590
states, the initial states
occur with these

00:37:26.590 --> 00:37:29.080
probabilities q of s.

00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:32.040
We have these best
Huffman code.

00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:36.940
So the number of binary digits
we're using per source symbol

00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:39.920
is really this average here.

00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:41.820
Because this is averaging
over all the states

00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:44.730
you're going to go into.

00:37:44.730 --> 00:37:52.000
And the entropy of the source
output, conditional on the

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.430
chance variable s, is now,
in fact, defined

00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:58.280
just as that average.

00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:01.790
So they encoder transmits s
zero, followed by the code

00:38:01.790 --> 00:38:05.150
word for s 1 using s zero.

00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:08.740
That specifies s 1, and
then you encode x 2,

00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:11.480
using s 1 and so forth.

00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:13.760
And the decoder is sitting there
and the decoder does

00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:15.980
exactly the same thing.

00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:21.220
Namely, the decoder first sees
what s zero is, then it uses

00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:25.750
the code for s zero to decide
what x 1 was, then it uses the

00:38:25.750 --> 00:38:34.050
code for s 1, which is
determined by s 1, s one is

00:38:34.050 --> 00:38:38.100
determined by x 1, and it goes
on and on like that.

00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:48.460
Let me review a little bit about
conditional entropy.

00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:51.080
I'm going pretty fast here and
I'm not deriving these things

00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:54.810
because they're in the notes.

00:38:54.810 --> 00:38:58.880
And it's almost as if I want
you to get some kind of a

00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:03.300
pattern sensitivity to these
things, without the idea that

00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:04.350
we're going to use them a lot.

00:39:04.350 --> 00:39:08.040
You ought to have a general idea
of waht the results are.

00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:10.860
We're not going to spend a lot
of time on this because, as I

00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:14.610
said before, the only thing I
want you to recognize is that

00:39:14.610 --> 00:39:17.390
if you ever want to model a
source, this, in fact, gives

00:39:17.390 --> 00:39:20.350
you a general way of doing it.

00:39:20.350 --> 00:39:25.120
So this general entropy then is
using what we had before.

00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:28.510
It's the sum over all the
states, and the sum over all

00:39:28.510 --> 00:39:36.880
of the source outputs of these
log pmf probabilities.

00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:43.050
This general entropy of both a
symbol and a state is equal to

00:39:43.050 --> 00:39:45.160
this combined thing.

00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:48.730
Which is equal, not
surprisingly, to the entropy

00:39:48.730 --> 00:39:50.110
of the state.

00:39:50.110 --> 00:39:53.650
Namely, first you want to know
what the state is that has

00:39:53.650 --> 00:39:55.060
this entropy.

00:39:55.060 --> 00:39:59.020
And then given the state, this
is the entropy of the next

00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:01.060
letter, conditional
on the state.

00:40:03.610 --> 00:40:11.140
Since this joint entropy is less
than or equal to H of s

00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:14.000
plus H of x, I think you just
proved that in the homework,

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:15.300
didn't you?

00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:17.620
I hope so.

00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:22.660
That says that the entropy of
x conditional on s, is less

00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:28.270
than or equal to the entropy of
x, which is not surprising.

00:40:28.270 --> 00:40:31.810
It says that if you use the
previous state in trying to do

00:40:31.810 --> 00:40:34.660
source encoding, you're going
to do better than if

00:40:34.660 --> 00:40:35.910
you don't use it.

00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:40.010
I mean the whole theory
would be pretty

00:40:40.010 --> 00:40:41.260
stupid if you didn't.

00:40:47.010 --> 00:40:49.700
That's what that says.

00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:52.380
As I told you before, the only
way we can make all of this

00:40:52.380 --> 00:40:56.230
work is to use
n-to-variable-length codes for

00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:56.930
each state.

00:40:56.930 --> 00:41:01.390
In other words, you encode n
letters at the same time.

00:41:01.390 --> 00:41:07.060
If you look at the entropy of
the first n states given a

00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:12.350
starting state, turns out to
be n times H of x given s.

00:41:12.350 --> 00:41:15.320
By the same kind of rule that
you were using before.

00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:30.010
The same argument that you
used to show that this is

00:41:30.010 --> 00:41:36.460
equal to that, you can use to
show that this is equal to H

00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:41.940
of S 1, given S zero, plus H of
S 2, given S 1, plus H of S

00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:44.370
3, given S 2 and so forth.

00:41:44.370 --> 00:41:47.070
And by the stationarity that
we have here, these are all

00:41:47.070 --> 00:41:51.080
equal, so you wind up
with n times times

00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:53.260
this conditional entropy.

00:41:53.260 --> 00:41:57.650
And since the source outputs
specified the states, and the

00:41:57.650 --> 00:42:01.220
states specified the source
outputs, you can then convince

00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:05.560
yourself that this entropy is
also equal to n times H of X,

00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:09.760
given S. And once you do that,
you're back in the same

00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:13.470
position we were in when we
looked at n-to-variable-length

00:42:13.470 --> 00:42:18.220
coding when we were looking at
discrete memoryless sources.

00:42:18.220 --> 00:42:21.330
Namely, the only thing that
happens when you're looking at

00:42:21.330 --> 00:42:26.680
n-to-variable length coding,
is it that one fudge factor

00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:29.030
becomes a 1 over n.

00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:33.330
When you have a small symbol
space by going two blocks, you

00:42:33.330 --> 00:42:38.060
get rid of this, you can make
the expected length close to H

00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:42.490
of X, given S. Which means, in
fact, that all of the memory

00:42:42.490 --> 00:42:46.700
is taking into account and it
still is this one parameter,

00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:50.830
the entropy, that
says everything.

00:42:50.830 --> 00:42:53.690
The AEP holds --

00:42:53.690 --> 00:42:56.530
I mean if you want to, you can
sit down and just see that it

00:42:56.530 --> 00:43:01.130
holds, once you see what these
entropies are, I mean the

00:43:01.130 --> 00:43:06.110
entropy you're using log pmf's,
you're just looking at

00:43:06.110 --> 00:43:09.960
products of probabilities, which
are sums of log pmf's,

00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:13.170
and everything is the
same as before.

00:43:13.170 --> 00:43:17.920
And again, if you're using
n-to-variable-length codes,

00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:22.010
you just can't achieve an
expected length less than H of

00:43:22.010 --> 00:43:26.510
X, given S. So H of X, given
S gives the whole story.

00:43:31.140 --> 00:43:34.130
You should read those notes,
because I've gone through that

00:43:34.130 --> 00:43:38.160
very, very fast, partly because
some of you are

00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:40.840
already very familiar with
Markov chains some of you are

00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:44.490
probably less familiar with it,
so you should check that

00:43:44.490 --> 00:43:45.730
out a little bit on your own.

00:43:45.730 --> 00:43:50.980
I want to talk about the
Lempel Ziv universal

00:43:50.980 --> 00:43:56.270
algorithm, which was rather
surprising to many people.

00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:03.120
Jacob Ziv is one of the
great theorists

00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:05.560
of information theory.

00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:08.300
Before this time, he wrote
a lot of very,

00:44:08.300 --> 00:44:10.720
very powerful papers.

00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:14.500
Which were quite hard to
read in many cases.

00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:17.690
So it was a real surprise to
people when he came up with

00:44:17.690 --> 00:44:21.750
this beautiful idea, which was
a lovely, simple algorithm.

00:44:21.750 --> 00:44:25.425
Some people, because of that,
thought it was Abe Lempel, who

00:44:25.425 --> 00:44:28.760
spends part of his year at
Brandeis, who was really the

00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:30.720
genius behind it.

00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:34.160
In fact, it wasn't Abe Lempel,
it was Jacob Ziv who was the

00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:36.070
genius behind it.

00:44:36.070 --> 00:44:42.390
Abe Lempel was pretty much the
one who really implemented it,

00:44:42.390 --> 00:44:45.630
because once you see what the
algorithm is, it's still not

00:44:45.630 --> 00:44:49.650
trivial to try to find how
to implement it in a

00:44:49.650 --> 00:44:52.990
simple, easy way.

00:44:52.990 --> 00:44:56.350
If you look at all the articles
about it, the authors

00:44:56.350 --> 00:45:00.230
are Ziv and Lempel, instead of
Lempel and Ziv, so why it got

00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:04.020
called Lempel Ziv is a
mystery to everyone.

00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:07.450
Anyway, they came up with
two algorithms.

00:45:07.450 --> 00:45:12.770
One which they came up with in
1977, and people looked at

00:45:12.770 --> 00:45:16.530
their 1977 algorithm and said,
oh that's much too complicated

00:45:16.530 --> 00:45:18.210
to implement.

00:45:18.210 --> 00:45:20.830
So they went back to the drawing
board, came up with

00:45:20.830 --> 00:45:24.890
another one in 1978, which
people said, ah, we can

00:45:24.890 --> 00:45:26.900
implement that.

00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:31.750
So people started implementing
the LZ78 and of course, by

00:45:31.750 --> 00:45:34.920
that time, all the technology
was much better.

00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:39.380
You could do things faster and
cheaper then you could before,

00:45:39.380 --> 00:45:44.920
and what happened then is that
a few years after that people

00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:48.720
were implementing LZ77,
which turned out

00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:50.190
to work much better.

00:45:50.190 --> 00:45:51.930
Which is often the way
this field works.

00:45:51.930 --> 00:45:55.030
People do something interesting
theoretically,

00:45:55.030 --> 00:45:59.580
people say, no you can't do
it, so they simplify it,

00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:03.200
thereby destroying some of
its best characteristics.

00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:06.210
And then a few years later
people are doing the more

00:46:06.210 --> 00:46:08.930
sophisticated thing, which they
should have started out

00:46:08.930 --> 00:46:10.180
doing at the beginning.

00:46:13.730 --> 00:46:17.210
What is a Universal Data
Compression algorithm?

00:46:17.210 --> 00:46:21.330
A Universal Data Compression
algorithm, is an algorithm

00:46:21.330 --> 00:46:25.240
which doesn't have any
probabilities tucked into it.

00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:28.690
In other words, the algorithm
itself simply looks at a

00:46:28.690 --> 00:46:31.320
sequence of letters from
an alphabet, and

00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:34.060
encodes it in some way.

00:46:34.060 --> 00:46:38.300
And what you would like to be
able to do is somehow measure

00:46:38.300 --> 00:46:42.400
what the statistics are, and
at the same time as you're

00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:47.000
measuring the statistics, you
want to encode the digits.

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.630
You don't care too
much about delay.

00:46:49.630 --> 00:46:51.610
In fact, one way to do this --

00:46:51.610 --> 00:46:53.680
I mean, if you're surprised
that you can build a good

00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:56.880
universal encoder,
you shouldn't be.

00:46:56.880 --> 00:47:00.200
Because you could just take the
first million letters out

00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:03.510
of the source, go through all
the statistical analysis you

00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:08.560
want to, model the source in
whatever way makes the best

00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:12.270
sense to you, and then build a
Huffman encoder, which, in

00:47:12.270 --> 00:47:16.780
fact, encodes things according
to that model that you have.

00:47:16.780 --> 00:47:19.710
Of course you then have to send
the decoder the first

00:47:19.710 --> 00:47:23.560
million digits, and the decoder
goes through the same

00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:26.730
statistical analysis, and
therefore finds out what code

00:47:26.730 --> 00:47:30.410
you're going to use, and then
the encoder encodes, the

00:47:30.410 --> 00:47:34.690
decoder decodes and you have
this million symbols of

00:47:34.690 --> 00:47:38.460
overhead in the algorithm, that
if you use the algorithm

00:47:38.460 --> 00:47:41.710
for a billion letters instead of
a million letters, then it

00:47:41.710 --> 00:47:43.160
all works pretty well.

00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:46.610
So there's a little bit of
that flavor here, but the

00:47:46.610 --> 00:47:50.730
other part of it is, it's
a neat algorithm.

00:47:50.730 --> 00:47:53.550
And the algorithm measures
things in a faster way then

00:47:53.550 --> 00:47:55.520
you would believe.

00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:59.080
And as you look at it later
you say, gee, this makes a

00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:02.820
great deal of sense even if
there isn't much statistical

00:48:02.820 --> 00:48:04.690
structure here.

00:48:04.690 --> 00:48:09.860
In other words, you can show
that if the source really is a

00:48:09.860 --> 00:48:15.220
Markov source, then this
algorithm will behave just as

00:48:15.220 --> 00:48:20.740
well, asymptotically, as the
best algorithm you can design

00:48:20.740 --> 00:48:22.350
for that Markov source.

00:48:22.350 --> 00:48:28.450
Namely, it's so good that it
will in fact measure the

00:48:28.450 --> 00:48:33.970
statistics in that Markov model
and implement them.

00:48:33.970 --> 00:48:36.780
But it does something
better than that.

00:48:36.780 --> 00:48:40.280
And the thing which is better
is that, if you're going to

00:48:40.280 --> 00:48:43.690
look at this first million
symbols and your objective

00:48:43.690 --> 00:48:48.920
then is to build a Markov model,
after you build the

00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:52.240
Markov model for that million
symbols, one of the things

00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:54.890
that you always question about
is, should I have used a

00:48:54.890 --> 00:48:59.270
Markov model or should I have
used some other kind of model?

00:48:59.270 --> 00:49:01.330
And that's a difficult
question to ask.

00:49:01.330 --> 00:49:04.460
You go through all of the
different possibilities, and

00:49:04.460 --> 00:49:07.460
one of the nice things about the
Lempel Ziv algorithm is,

00:49:07.460 --> 00:49:11.010
in a sense, it just does
this automatically.

00:49:11.010 --> 00:49:13.620
If there's some kind of
statistical structure there,

00:49:13.620 --> 00:49:15.820
it's going to find it.

00:49:15.820 --> 00:49:19.040
If it's not Markov, if it's some
other kind of structure,

00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:20.050
it will find it.

00:49:20.050 --> 00:49:22.790
The question is how does it
find this statistical

00:49:22.790 --> 00:49:27.800
structure without knowing what
kind of model you should use

00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:29.010
to start with?

00:49:29.010 --> 00:49:32.100
And that's the genius of things
which are universal,

00:49:32.100 --> 00:49:35.430
because they don't assume that
you have to measure particular

00:49:35.430 --> 00:49:38.560
things in some model that
you believe in.

00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:41.090
It just does the whole
thing all at once.

00:49:41.090 --> 00:49:45.230
If it's running along and the
statistics change, bing, it

00:49:45.230 --> 00:49:48.070
changes, too.

00:49:48.070 --> 00:49:51.750
And suddenly it will start
producing more binary digits

00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:54.590
per source symbol, or fewer,
because that's

00:49:54.590 --> 00:49:56.480
what it has to do.

00:49:56.480 --> 00:49:59.140
And that's just the
way it works.

00:49:59.140 --> 00:50:02.510
But it does have all these
nice properties.

00:50:02.510 --> 00:50:05.770
It has instantaneous
decodability.

00:50:05.770 --> 00:50:09.770
In a sense, it is a prefix-free
code, although you

00:50:09.770 --> 00:50:11.430
have to interpret
pretty carefully

00:50:11.430 --> 00:50:12.730
what you mean by that.

00:50:12.730 --> 00:50:16.010
We'll understand that
in a little bit.

00:50:16.010 --> 00:50:20.680
But in fact, it does do all
of these neat things.

00:50:20.680 --> 00:50:25.420
And there are better algorithms
out there now,

00:50:25.420 --> 00:50:29.380
whether they're better in terms
of the trade-off between

00:50:29.380 --> 00:50:34.690
complexity and compressability,
I don't know.

00:50:34.690 --> 00:50:37.390
But anyway, the people who do
research on these things have

00:50:37.390 --> 00:50:40.670
to have something to
keep them busy.

00:50:40.670 --> 00:50:44.690
And they have to have some kind
of results to get money

00:50:44.690 --> 00:50:48.160
for, and therefore they claim
that the new algorithms are

00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:50.110
better than the old
algorithms.

00:50:50.110 --> 00:50:53.620
And they probably are,
but I'm not sure.

00:50:53.620 --> 00:50:55.140
Anyway, this is a very
cute algorithm.

00:51:00.540 --> 00:51:04.190
So what you're trying to do
here, the objective, one

00:51:04.190 --> 00:51:09.500
objective which is achieved, is
if you observe the output

00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:13.620
from the given probability
model, say a Markov source,

00:51:13.620 --> 00:51:17.810
and I build the best code I can
for that Markov source,

00:51:17.810 --> 00:51:20.250
then we know how many bits
we need per symbol.

00:51:20.250 --> 00:51:23.800
Number of bits we need per
symbol is this entropy of a

00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:27.280
letter of a symbol
given the state.

00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:29.750
That's the best we can do.

00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:33.160
How well does the Lempel
Ziv algorithm do?

00:51:33.160 --> 00:51:37.290
Asymptotically, when you make
everything large it will

00:51:37.290 --> 00:51:41.130
encode using a number of bits
per symbol, which is H of X,

00:51:41.130 --> 00:51:45.770
given S. So it'll do just as
well as the best thing does

00:51:45.770 --> 00:51:49.030
which happens to know the
model to start with.

00:51:49.030 --> 00:51:53.520
As I said before the algorithm
also compresses in the absence

00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:56.120
of any ordinary kind of
statistical structure.

00:51:56.120 --> 00:51:58.860
Whatever kind of structure
is there, this

00:51:58.860 --> 00:52:01.160
algorithm sorts it out.

00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:04.080
It should deal with gradually
changing statistics.

00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:06.980
It does that also, but perhaps
not in the best way.

00:52:06.980 --> 00:52:08.280
We'll talk about that later.

00:52:11.730 --> 00:52:13.180
Let's describe it
a little bit.

00:52:19.350 --> 00:52:23.800
If we let x 1, x 2 blah blah
blah, be the output of the

00:52:23.800 --> 00:52:29.610
source, and the alphabet is some
alphabet capital X, which

00:52:29.610 --> 00:52:41.720
has size m, let's just as
notation, let x sub m super n

00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:46.780
denote the string xm,
xm plus 1, up to xn.

00:52:46.780 --> 00:52:49.900
In other words, in describing
this algorithm we are, all the

00:52:49.900 --> 00:52:54.310
time talking about strings of
letters taken out of this

00:52:54.310 --> 00:52:57.110
infinite length string that
comes out of the source.

00:52:57.110 --> 00:53:00.800
We want to have a nice notation
for talking about a

00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:04.210
sub string of the
actual sequence.

00:53:04.210 --> 00:53:08.300
We're going to use a window
in this algorithm.

00:53:08.300 --> 00:53:12.510
We want the window to have a
size with the power of 2.

00:53:12.510 --> 00:53:17.290
Typical values for the window
range from about a thousand up

00:53:17.290 --> 00:53:20.270
to about a million.

00:53:20.270 --> 00:53:23.830
Maybe they're even bigger
now, I don't know.

00:53:23.830 --> 00:53:25.740
But as we'll see later, there's

00:53:25.740 --> 00:53:28.370
some constraints there.

00:53:28.370 --> 00:53:33.950
What the Lempel Ziv algorithm
does, this LZ77 algorithm, is

00:53:33.950 --> 00:53:38.830
it matches the longest string
of yet unencoded -- this is

00:53:38.830 --> 00:53:47.310
unencoded also, isn't it,
that's simple enough --

00:53:47.310 --> 00:53:51.330
of yet unencoded symbols
by using strings

00:53:51.330 --> 00:53:52.370
starting in the window.

00:53:52.370 --> 00:53:56.700
So it takes this sequence of
stuff we haven't observed yet,

00:53:56.700 --> 00:54:00.750
it tries to find the longest
string starting there which it

00:54:00.750 --> 00:54:04.590
can match with something that's
already in the window.

00:54:04.590 --> 00:54:07.580
If it can find something which
matches with something in the

00:54:07.580 --> 00:54:10.630
window, what does it do?

00:54:10.630 --> 00:54:13.940
It's going to first say how long
the match was, and then

00:54:13.940 --> 00:54:17.210
it's going to say where in
the window it found it.

00:54:17.210 --> 00:54:19.830
And the decoder is sitting
there, the decoder has this

00:54:19.830 --> 00:54:24.570
window which it observes also,
so the decoder can find the

00:54:24.570 --> 00:54:27.200
same match which is
in the window.

00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:29.870
Why does it work?

00:54:29.870 --> 00:54:33.740
Well, it works because with all
of these AEP properties

00:54:33.740 --> 00:54:37.750
that we're thinking of, you tend
to have typical sequences

00:54:37.750 --> 00:54:39.790
sitting there in the window.

00:54:39.790 --> 00:54:42.420
And you tend to have typical
sequences which come out of

00:54:42.420 --> 00:54:43.300
the source.

00:54:43.300 --> 00:54:46.300
So the thing we're trying to
encode is some typical

00:54:46.300 --> 00:54:48.660
sequence --

00:54:48.660 --> 00:54:51.470
well you can you can think of
short typical sequences and

00:54:51.470 --> 00:54:53.510
longer typical sequences.

00:54:53.510 --> 00:54:56.980
We try to find the longest
typical sequence that we can.

00:54:56.980 --> 00:54:59.530
And we're looking back into
this window, and there are

00:54:59.530 --> 00:55:02.290
enormous number of typical
sequences there.

00:55:02.290 --> 00:55:04.720
If we make the typical sequences
short enough, there

00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:07.430
aren't too many of them, and
most of them are sitting there

00:55:07.430 --> 00:55:09.000
in the window.

00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:13.150
This'll become clearer
as we go.

00:55:13.150 --> 00:55:15.280
Let's go on and actually
explain what

00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:16.560
the algorithm does.

00:55:20.130 --> 00:55:23.930
So here's the algorithm.

00:55:23.930 --> 00:55:29.850
First, you take this large W,
this large window size, and

00:55:29.850 --> 00:55:32.190
we're going to encode the
first thought W symbols.

00:55:32.190 --> 00:55:35.500
We're not even going to use any
compression, that's just

00:55:35.500 --> 00:55:37.320
lost stuff.

00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:41.820
So we encode this first million
symbols, we grin and

00:55:41.820 --> 00:55:45.640
bear it, and then the decoder
has this window

00:55:45.640 --> 00:55:47.170
of a million symbols.

00:55:47.170 --> 00:55:50.840
We at the encoder have this
window of a million symbols,

00:55:50.840 --> 00:55:53.350
and we proceed from there.

00:55:53.350 --> 00:55:56.150
So it gets amortized,
so we don't care.

00:55:56.150 --> 00:56:01.350
So we then have a pointer, and
we set the pointer to W.

00:56:01.350 --> 00:56:05.610
So the pointer is the last
thing that we encoded.

00:56:05.610 --> 00:56:10.190
So we have all this encoded
stuff starting at time P,

00:56:10.190 --> 00:56:14.850
everything beyond there
is as yet unencoded.

00:56:14.850 --> 00:56:17.200
That's the first step
in the algorithm.

00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:18.450
So far, so good.

00:56:22.740 --> 00:56:27.360
The next step is to find the
largest n, greater than or

00:56:27.360 --> 00:56:29.780
equal to 2, I'll explain why
greater than or equal to 2

00:56:29.780 --> 00:56:38.160
later, such that the string x
sub p plus 1 up to p plus n,

00:56:38.160 --> 00:56:39.190
what is that?

00:56:39.190 --> 00:56:43.820
It's the string which starts
right beyond the pointer,

00:56:43.820 --> 00:56:47.160
namely the string that starts
here, what we're trying to do

00:56:47.160 --> 00:56:50.560
is find the largest n, in other
words the longest string

00:56:50.560 --> 00:56:54.020
starting here, which we can
match with something that's in

00:56:54.020 --> 00:56:55.290
the window.

00:56:55.290 --> 00:57:00.430
Now we look at a, a is in the
window, we look at a b, a b as

00:57:00.430 --> 00:57:01.530
in the window.

00:57:01.530 --> 00:57:10.900
We look at a b a, a b a as in
the window. a b a b, a b a b

00:57:10.900 --> 00:57:12.530
is not in the window.

00:57:12.530 --> 00:57:15.960
At least I hope it's not in the
window or I screwed up.

00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:17.210
Yeah, it's not in the window.

00:57:17.210 --> 00:57:20.810
So the longest thing we can find
which matches with what's

00:57:20.810 --> 00:57:23.430
in the window is this match
of length three.

00:57:26.440 --> 00:57:29.420
So this is finding the longest
match which matches with

00:57:29.420 --> 00:57:31.770
something here.

00:57:31.770 --> 00:57:36.900
This next example, I think
the only way I can regard

00:57:36.900 --> 00:57:39.300
that is as a hack.

00:57:39.300 --> 00:57:42.410
It's a kind of hack that
programmers like.

00:57:42.410 --> 00:57:45.500
It's very mysterious, but it's
also the kind of hack that

00:57:45.500 --> 00:57:49.840
mathematicians like because in
this case this particular hack

00:57:49.840 --> 00:57:52.790
makes the analysis
much easier.

00:57:52.790 --> 00:57:55.420
So this is another
kind of match.

00:57:55.420 --> 00:57:58.240
It's looking for the longest
string here,

00:57:58.240 --> 00:58:00.510
starting at this pointer.

00:58:00.510 --> 00:58:05.450
a b a b so forth, which matches
things starting here.

00:58:05.450 --> 00:58:07.150
Starting somewhere
in the window.

00:58:07.150 --> 00:58:11.990
So it finds a match a
b here. a b a here.

00:58:11.990 --> 00:58:17.050
But now it looks for a b
a b, a match of four.

00:58:17.050 --> 00:58:18.640
Where do we find it?

00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:21.940
We can start back here, which
is still in the window, and

00:58:21.940 --> 00:58:25.190
what we see is a b a b.

00:58:25.190 --> 00:58:30.160
So these four digits match
these four digits.

00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:34.410
Well you might say foul ball,
because if I tell you there's

00:58:34.410 --> 00:58:40.740
a match of four and I tell you
where it is, in fact, all the

00:58:40.740 --> 00:58:44.600
poor decoder knows is this.

00:58:44.600 --> 00:58:48.180
If I tell you there's a match
of four and it starts here,

00:58:48.180 --> 00:58:50.110
what's the poor decoder
going to do?

00:58:50.110 --> 00:58:56.950
The poor decoder says, ok, so
a is that digit two digits

00:58:56.950 --> 00:58:59.180
ago, so that gives me the a.

00:58:59.180 --> 00:59:02.000
So I know there's an a
there. b is the next

00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:04.920
digit, so b is there.

00:59:04.920 --> 00:59:08.420
And then I know the first two
digits beyond the window, and

00:59:08.420 --> 00:59:12.960
therefore this third digit is a,
so that must be that digit.

00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:15.340
The fourth digit is
this digit, which

00:59:15.340 --> 00:59:17.030
must be that digit.

00:59:17.030 --> 00:59:18.430
OK?

00:59:18.430 --> 00:59:21.220
If you didn't catch that, you
can just think about it, it'll

00:59:21.220 --> 00:59:23.140
become clear.

00:59:23.140 --> 00:59:24.510
I mean it really is a hack.

00:59:24.510 --> 00:59:25.830
It's not very important.

00:59:25.830 --> 00:59:28.000
It won't change the way
this thing bahaves.

00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:33.470
But it does change the
way you analyze it

00:59:33.470 --> 00:59:34.690
So that's the first
thing you do, you

00:59:34.690 --> 00:59:38.170
look for these matches.

00:59:38.170 --> 00:59:40.230
Next thing we're going to do
is we're going to try to

00:59:40.230 --> 00:59:42.690
encode the matches.

00:59:42.690 --> 00:59:46.640
Namely, we're going to try to
encode the thing the we found

00:59:46.640 --> 00:59:48.180
in the window.

00:59:48.180 --> 00:59:50.900
How do we encode what we
found in the window?

00:59:50.900 --> 00:59:52.480
Well the first thing we
have to do -- yeah?

00:59:52.480 --> 00:59:55.630
AUDIENCE: What if you don't
find any matches?

00:59:55.630 --> 00:59:56.980
PROFESSOR: I'm going to
talk about that later.

00:59:56.980 --> 01:00:00.030
If you don't find any matches,
I mean what I was looking for

01:00:00.030 --> 01:00:02.900
was matches of two or more.

01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:06.440
If you don't find any matches of
two or more, what you do is

01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:11.040
you just take the first letter
in the window and you encode

01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:12.390
that without any compression.

01:00:16.790 --> 01:00:21.180
I mean our strategy here is to
always send the length of the

01:00:21.180 --> 01:00:22.530
match first.

01:00:22.530 --> 01:00:25.870
If you say the length of the
match is one, than the decoder

01:00:25.870 --> 01:00:28.850
knows to look for uncompressed
symbols, instead of looking

01:00:28.850 --> 01:00:30.750
for something in the window.

01:00:30.750 --> 01:00:33.880
So it takes care of the case
where there haven't been any

01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:38.240
occurrences of symbol anywhere
in the window.

01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:41.030
So you only look for matches
of length two or more.

01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:50.350
So then you use something called
a unary-binary code.

01:00:50.350 --> 01:00:54.990
Theoriticians always copy
everybody else's work.

01:00:54.990 --> 01:01:01.030
The unary-binary code was due
to Peter Elias, who was the

01:01:01.030 --> 01:01:03.960
head of this department
for a long time.

01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:07.610
He just died about
six months ago.

01:01:07.610 --> 01:01:10.970
He was here up until
his death.

01:01:10.970 --> 01:01:14.290
He used to organize department
colloquia.

01:01:14.290 --> 01:01:17.620
He was so essential that since
he died, nobody's taken over

01:01:17.620 --> 01:01:19.430
the department colloquia.

01:01:19.430 --> 01:01:23.090
He was my thesis adviser, so I
tend to think very kindly of

01:01:23.090 --> 01:01:26.350
him And he was lots
of other things.

01:01:26.350 --> 01:01:31.195
But anyway, he invented this
unary-binary code, which is a

01:01:31.195 --> 01:01:33.980
way of encoding the integers,
which has a lot of nice

01:01:33.980 --> 01:01:35.530
properties.

01:01:35.530 --> 01:01:39.230
And they're universal
properties, as you will see.

01:01:39.230 --> 01:01:42.130
The idea is to encode the
integers, there are infinite

01:01:42.130 --> 01:01:44.550
number of integers.

01:01:44.550 --> 01:01:47.870
What you'd like to do, somehow
or other, is have shorter code

01:01:47.870 --> 01:01:51.530
words for lower integers,
and longer code

01:01:51.530 --> 01:01:54.920
words for longer integers.

01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:58.140
In this particular Lempel Ziv
algorithm, it's particularly

01:01:58.140 --> 01:02:01.920
important to have the lenght of
the code words growing as

01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:04.790
the logarithm of n.

01:02:04.790 --> 01:02:08.720
Because then anytime you find
a really long match, and you

01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:11.560
got a very large n, you're
encoding a whole lot of

01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:16.020
letters, and therefore you
don't care if there's an

01:02:16.020 --> 01:02:19.080
overhead which is proportional
to log n.

01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:20.720
So you don't mind that.

01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:23.680
And if there's a very small
number of letters encoded, you

01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:27.280
want something very
efficient then.

01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:28.910
So it does that.

01:02:28.910 --> 01:02:33.950
And the way it does it is, first
you generate a prefix,

01:02:33.950 --> 01:02:38.470
and then you have a
representation in base 2.

01:02:38.470 --> 01:02:40.450
Namely base 2 expansion.

01:02:40.450 --> 01:02:46.750
So the number n, the prefix
here, I think I said it here,

01:02:46.750 --> 01:02:49.980
the positive integer n is
encoded into the binary

01:02:49.980 --> 01:02:56.070
representation of n, preceded by
a prefix of integer part of

01:02:56.070 --> 01:02:58.790
log to the base 2 of n zero.

01:02:58.790 --> 01:03:03.930
Now what's the integer part
of log to the base 2 of 1?

01:03:03.930 --> 01:03:07.220
Log to the base 2
of 1 is zero.

01:03:07.220 --> 01:03:10.320
It was a prefix of zero zeros.

01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:12.390
So zero zeros is nothing.

01:03:12.390 --> 01:03:17.890
So the prefix is nothing, the
expansion of 1, in a base 2

01:03:17.890 --> 01:03:21.360
expansion or any other
expansion, is 1.

01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:25.830
So the code word for 1 is 1.

01:03:25.830 --> 01:03:31.820
If you have the number 2, log
to the base 2 of 2 is 1.

01:03:31.820 --> 01:03:35.510
The integer part of 1 is 1, so
you start out with a single

01:03:35.510 --> 01:03:38.550
zero and then you have
the expansion, 2 is

01:03:38.550 --> 01:03:40.590
expanded as 1 zero.

01:03:40.590 --> 01:03:41.970
And so forth.

01:03:41.970 --> 01:03:46.700
Oh and then 3 is expanded as 1
1, again with a prefix of 1.

01:03:46.700 --> 01:03:49.470
Four is encoded as
1 zero zero, blah

01:03:49.470 --> 01:03:52.600
blah blah and so forth.

01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:55.500
Why don't you just leave
the prefix out?

01:04:00.090 --> 01:04:02.750
Anybody figure out why I
need the prefix there?

01:04:02.750 --> 01:04:07.250
AUDIENCE: If without those
prefixes, you don't a

01:04:07.250 --> 01:04:07.490
prefix-free code.

01:04:07.490 --> 01:04:12.430
PROFESSOR: Yeah Right.

01:04:12.430 --> 01:04:15.850
If I left them out, everything
would start with 1.

01:04:15.850 --> 01:04:18.680
I would get to the 1, I would
say, gee, is that the end of

01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:20.580
it or isn't it the end of it?

01:04:20.580 --> 01:04:23.050
I wouldn't know.

01:04:23.050 --> 01:04:26.840
But with this, if I see 1, the
only code word that starts

01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:30.030
with 1 is this one.

01:04:30.030 --> 01:04:34.780
If it's 2 or 3, it starts with
zero and then there's a 1,

01:04:34.780 --> 01:04:39.010
which says it's on that next
branch which has probably 1/4.

01:04:39.010 --> 01:04:45.380
I have a 1 0, 1 1, a prefix of
0 0, followed by a 1, put me

01:04:45.380 --> 01:04:47.640
off on another branch.

01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:49.150
And so forth.

01:04:49.150 --> 01:04:51.810
So, yes, this is a
prefix-free code.

01:04:51.810 --> 01:04:56.000
And it's a prefix-free code
which has this nice property

01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:02.890
that the number of digits in the
code word is approximately

01:05:02.890 --> 01:05:04.980
2 times log n.

01:05:04.980 --> 01:05:08.940
Namely, it goes up
both ways here.

01:05:08.940 --> 01:05:12.540
The number of zeros I need is
log to the base 2 of n.

01:05:12.540 --> 01:05:15.910
The number of digits in the base
2 expansion, is also the

01:05:15.910 --> 01:05:19.310
integer part of log to
the base 2 of n.

01:05:19.310 --> 01:05:21.820
So it works both ways.

01:05:21.820 --> 01:05:26.920
And there's always this
1 in the middle.

01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:28.880
Again, it's a hack.

01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:30.940
It's a hack that works
very nicely when you

01:05:30.940 --> 01:05:32.350
try to analyze this.

01:05:35.830 --> 01:05:41.480
OK so if the size of the match
is bigger than one, we're

01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:44.810
going to encode the positive
integer u.

01:05:44.810 --> 01:05:47.750
u was where the match
occurred.

01:05:47.750 --> 01:05:49.670
How far back do you have
to count before

01:05:49.670 --> 01:05:51.780
you find this match?

01:05:51.780 --> 01:05:55.020
You're going to encode that
integer u into a fixed length

01:05:55.020 --> 01:06:00.530
code of length log of w bits.

01:06:00.530 --> 01:06:03.020
In other words, you
have a window of

01:06:03.020 --> 01:06:05.780
size 2 to the twentieth.

01:06:05.780 --> 01:06:10.860
You can encode any point in
there with 20 binary digits.

01:06:10.860 --> 01:06:14.740
The 20 binary digits say how far
do you have to go back to

01:06:14.740 --> 01:06:16.060
find this code word.

01:06:19.660 --> 01:06:23.850
So first we're encoding n, by
this unary-binary code, then

01:06:23.850 --> 01:06:27.240
we're encoding w just with
this simple minded way of

01:06:27.240 --> 01:06:29.780
encoding log w bits.

01:06:29.780 --> 01:06:32.000
And that tells us where
the match is.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:40.110
The decoder goes back, there
finds the match, pumps it out

01:06:40.110 --> 01:06:42.990
if n is equal to 1, here's the
answer to your question, you

01:06:42.990 --> 01:06:45.840
encode the single letter
without compression.

01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:49.370
And that takes care of the case,
either where you have a

01:06:49.370 --> 01:06:52.890
match to that single letter,
or there isn't any match to

01:06:52.890 --> 01:06:55.980
the single letter.

01:06:55.980 --> 01:06:58.140
The next thing, as you might
imagine, is you set the

01:06:58.140 --> 01:07:03.570
pointer to P plus n, because
you've encoded n digits, and

01:07:03.570 --> 01:07:04.770
you go to step two.

01:07:04.770 --> 01:07:07.470
Namely, you keep iterating
forever.

01:07:07.470 --> 01:07:11.420
Until the source wears out, or
until the encoder wears out,

01:07:11.420 --> 01:07:13.370
or until the decoder
wears out.

01:07:13.370 --> 01:07:16.030
You just keep going.

01:07:16.030 --> 01:07:17.790
That's all the algorithm is.

01:07:17.790 --> 01:07:18.050
Yeah?

01:07:18.050 --> 01:07:23.692
AUDIENCE: Can you throw out
the first n bits, when you

01:07:23.692 --> 01:07:27.852
reset the pointer, because you
only have w bits that say

01:07:27.852 --> 01:07:29.102
where n was for the
next iteration?

01:07:31.260 --> 01:07:35.730
PROFESSOR: No, I throw out the
n oldest bits in the window.

01:07:35.730 --> 01:07:37.570
AUDIENCE: Well, those are
the first n bits.

01:07:37.570 --> 01:07:40.790
PROFESSOR: Yes the first n bits
out of the window and I

01:07:40.790 --> 01:07:45.010
keep all of the more
recent bits.

01:07:45.010 --> 01:07:47.530
I tend to think of the first
ones as the things closest to

01:07:47.530 --> 01:07:53.600
the pointer, but you think of it
either way, which is fine.

01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:56.960
So as you do it, the window
keeps sliding along.

01:08:00.790 --> 01:08:02.700
That's what it does.

01:08:07.650 --> 01:08:11.430
Why do you think this works?
/ There's a half

01:08:11.430 --> 01:08:13.520
analysis in the notes.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:20.530
i'd like to say a little bit
about how that analysis is

01:08:20.530 --> 01:08:25.450
cheating, because it's not
quite a fair analysis.

01:08:25.450 --> 01:08:29.460
If you look at the window, there
are w different starting

01:08:29.460 --> 01:08:32.830
points in the window.

01:08:32.830 --> 01:08:34.630
So let's write this down.

01:08:38.100 --> 01:08:40.780
w starting points.

01:08:48.590 --> 01:08:56.860
So for any given n, there
are there are w

01:08:56.860 --> 01:09:02.050
springs of length n.

01:09:07.180 --> 01:09:11.070
We don't know how long this
match is going to be, but what

01:09:11.070 --> 01:09:14.850
I would like to do, if I'm
thinking of a Markov source,

01:09:14.850 --> 01:09:20.810
is to say, OK, let's make n
large enough so that the size

01:09:20.810 --> 01:09:24.620
of the typical set is about w.

01:09:24.620 --> 01:09:25.040
ok

01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:45.910
So choose n to be about w
divided by H of X given S. And

01:09:45.910 --> 01:09:50.530
the size of the typical set is
then going to be 2 to the n,

01:09:50.530 --> 01:09:52.660
wait a minute.

01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:02.860
n is equal to log w.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:16.460
So the size of the typical set
then is T sub epsilon, is

01:10:16.460 --> 01:10:23.240
going to be roughly from what we
said 2 to the n times H of

01:10:23.240 --> 01:10:32.550
X given S. So what I'm going to
do is to set w equal to T

01:10:32.550 --> 01:10:33.800
of epsilon.

01:10:39.090 --> 01:10:45.080
I'm going to focus on a match
length which I'm hoping to

01:10:45.080 --> 01:10:50.470
achieve, of log w over H of X
given S. The typical set,

01:10:50.470 --> 01:10:55.675
then, is a size 2 to the n times
H of x give S. And if

01:10:55.675 --> 01:11:00.380
the typical set is of this size,
and I look at these w

01:11:00.380 --> 01:11:04.030
strings in the window, yeah,
I'm going to have some

01:11:04.030 --> 01:11:08.380
duplicates but roughly I'm going
to have a large enough

01:11:08.380 --> 01:11:12.780
number of things in the window
to represent all of these

01:11:12.780 --> 01:11:13.990
typical strings.

01:11:13.990 --> 01:11:15.660
Or most of them.

01:11:15.660 --> 01:11:19.680
If I try to choose an n which is
a little bigger than that,

01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:22.540
let's call this n star.

01:11:22.540 --> 01:11:26.190
If I try to make n a little bit
bigger than this typical

01:11:26.190 --> 01:11:29.970
match size, I don't have a
prayer of a chance, because

01:11:29.970 --> 01:11:34.340
the typical set then is just
very much larger than w, so

01:11:34.340 --> 01:11:38.360
I'd be very, very lucky if I
found anything in the window.

01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:40.310
So that can't work.

01:11:40.310 --> 01:11:45.160
If I make n a good deal smaller,
then I'm going to

01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:49.030
succeed with great probability
it seems, because I'm even

01:11:49.030 --> 01:11:51.600
allowing for many, many
duplicates of each of these

01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:55.540
typical sets to be
in the window.

01:11:55.540 --> 01:11:57.610
So what this is saying is
there ought to be some

01:11:57.610 --> 01:12:00.600
critical length when the
window was very large,

01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:04.050
critical match length, and most
of the time the match is

01:12:04.050 --> 01:12:08.310
going to be somewhere around
this value here.

01:12:08.310 --> 01:12:11.880
And as w becomes truly
humongous, and as the match

01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:13.990
size becomes large --

01:12:13.990 --> 01:12:17.360
you remember for these typical
sets to make any sense, this

01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:19.690
number has to be large.

01:12:19.690 --> 01:12:22.230
And when this number gets large,
the size of the typical

01:12:22.230 --> 01:12:25.750
set it humongous.

01:12:25.750 --> 01:12:29.770
Which says, that for this
asymptotic analysis, a window

01:12:29.770 --> 01:12:32.370
of 2 to the twentieth, probably

01:12:32.370 --> 01:12:34.530
isn't nearly big enough.

01:12:34.530 --> 01:12:38.530
So the asymptotic analysis is
really saying, when you have

01:12:38.530 --> 01:12:41.670
really humongous windows
this is going to work.

01:12:44.630 --> 01:12:47.390
You don't make windows that
large, so you have to have

01:12:47.390 --> 01:12:50.560
some faith that this theoretical
argument is going

01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:51.250
to work here.

01:12:51.250 --> 01:12:54.950
But that tells you roughly what
the size of these matches

01:12:54.950 --> 01:12:56.280
is going to be.

01:12:56.280 --> 01:13:05.020
If the size of the matches is
that, and you use log w bits

01:13:05.020 --> 01:13:09.390
plus 2 log n bits, to encode
each match, what happens?

01:13:14.130 --> 01:13:15.890
Encode match.

01:13:23.350 --> 01:13:36.180
You use log w, plus
2 log n star.

01:13:36.180 --> 01:13:38.530
That's the number of bits it
takes you, this is the number

01:13:38.530 --> 01:13:42.770
of bits it takes you to encode
what the match size is.

01:13:42.770 --> 01:13:44.720
You still have to encode that.

01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:48.790
This is the number of bits it
takes you to encode where the

01:13:48.790 --> 01:13:50.720
match occurs.

01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:54.290
Now how big is this
relative to this?

01:13:54.290 --> 01:14:00.700
Well n star is on the order of
log w, so we're taking log w

01:14:00.700 --> 01:14:05.480
plus 2 times log of log of w.

01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:08.860
So in an approximate analysis,
you say, I don't even care

01:14:08.860 --> 01:14:11.760
about that.

01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:17.460
You wind up with encoding
a match with log w bits.

01:14:17.460 --> 01:14:22.530
So you encode n star bits, you
use log w bits to do it, how

01:14:22.530 --> 01:14:27.300
many bits are you using
per symbol?

01:14:27.300 --> 01:14:43.725
H of X given S. That's roughly
the idea of why the Lempel Ziv

01:14:43.725 --> 01:14:46.020
algorithm works.

01:14:46.020 --> 01:14:48.880
Can anybody spot any problems
with that analysis?

01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:49.210
Yeah.

01:14:49.210 --> 01:14:55.643
AUDIENCE: You don't know the
probabilities beforehand, so

01:14:55.643 --> 01:15:00.490
how do you pick w?

01:15:00.490 --> 01:15:02.350
PROFESSOR: Good one.

01:15:02.350 --> 01:15:09.320
You picked w by saying, I have
a computer which will go at a

01:15:09.320 --> 01:15:10.820
certain speed.

01:15:10.820 --> 01:15:14.390
My data rate is coming in at a
certain speed, and I'm going

01:15:14.390 --> 01:15:17.690
to pick w as large as
I can keep up with.

01:15:17.690 --> 01:15:19.710
With the best algorithm
I can think of for

01:15:19.710 --> 01:15:23.010
doing string matching.

01:15:23.010 --> 01:15:26.690
And string matching a hard thing
to do, but it's not a

01:15:26.690 --> 01:15:29.100
terribly easy thing
to do either.

01:15:29.100 --> 01:15:30.810
So you make w as large
as you can.

01:15:33.830 --> 01:15:36.480
And if it's not large
enough, tough.

01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:39.760
You got matches which are
somewhat smaller -- all this

01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:43.830
argument about typical sets
still work except for the

01:15:43.830 --> 01:15:48.690
epsilon and deltas that
are tucked into there.

01:15:48.690 --> 01:15:51.560
So it's just that the epsilons
and the deltas get too big

01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:54.410
when you're strings are
not long enough.

01:15:54.410 --> 01:15:54.740
Yeah?

01:15:54.740 --> 01:15:59.931
AUDIENCE: So your w is just
make your processing time

01:15:59.931 --> 01:16:01.160
equal the time [UNINTELLIGIBLE]?

01:16:01.160 --> 01:16:03.550
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:16:03.550 --> 01:16:05.290
That's what the determines w.

01:16:05.290 --> 01:16:08.690
It's how fast you can do a
string search over this long,

01:16:08.690 --> 01:16:10.410
long window.

01:16:10.410 --> 01:16:13.950
You're not going to just search
everything one by one,

01:16:13.950 --> 01:16:16.300
you're going to build some kind
of data structure there

01:16:16.300 --> 01:16:19.940
that makes these searches
run fast.

01:16:19.940 --> 01:16:21.870
Can anybody think of why
you might not want

01:16:21.870 --> 01:16:23.350
to make w too large?

01:16:28.150 --> 01:16:31.010
This isn't a theoretical
reason, this is

01:16:31.010 --> 01:16:31.790
more practical thing.

01:16:31.790 --> 01:16:33.993
AUDIENCE: Is it if the
probabilities change, it's

01:16:33.993 --> 01:16:35.370
slow to react to
those changes?

01:16:35.370 --> 01:16:37.110
PROFESSOR: If the probabilities
change, it's

01:16:37.110 --> 01:16:41.900
slow to react to them, because
it's got this humongous window

01:16:41.900 --> 01:16:46.300
here, and it's not until the
window fills up with all of

01:16:46.300 --> 01:16:53.240
this new stuff, that it
starts to work well.

01:16:53.240 --> 01:16:57.150
And before it fills up, you're
using an effective small

01:16:57.150 --> 01:17:00.910
window, but you're using a
number of bits which is

01:17:00.910 --> 01:17:04.250
proportionate to log of a large
window, and therefore

01:17:04.250 --> 01:17:06.370
you're wasting bits.

01:17:06.370 --> 01:17:09.450
So another thing that that
determines how big you

01:17:09.450 --> 01:17:11.630
want w to be --

01:17:11.630 --> 01:17:14.040
I mean the main thing that's
determines it is just that you

01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:15.940
can't run that fast.

01:17:15.940 --> 01:17:19.130
Because you'd like to
make it pretty big.

01:17:19.130 --> 01:17:21.090
Another question.

01:17:21.090 --> 01:17:25.140
How about this matter of wasting
w symbols at the

01:17:25.140 --> 01:17:27.560
beginning to fill
up the window?

01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:28.810
what do you do about that?

01:17:31.420 --> 01:17:33.220
I mean, that's a pretty
stupid thing, right?

01:17:37.900 --> 01:17:40.340
Anybody suggest a solution
to that?

01:17:40.340 --> 01:17:44.720
If you're building this
yourself, how

01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:47.400
would you handle it?

01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:50.970
It's the same argument as if
the statistics change in

01:17:50.970 --> 01:17:52.220
mid-stream.

01:17:54.010 --> 01:17:56.890
I mean, you don't measure that
the statistics have changed,

01:17:56.890 --> 01:17:59.060
and throw out what's
in the window.

01:18:05.610 --> 01:18:06.000
What?

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.366
AUDIENCE: Can you not assume
that you already have a

01:18:08.366 --> 01:18:09.040
typical sequence?

01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:10.810
PROFESSOR: Yes, and you
don't care whether

01:18:10.810 --> 01:18:12.730
it's right or wrong.

01:18:12.730 --> 01:18:16.240
You could assume that the
typical sequence is all zeros,

01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:18.570
so you fill up the window
with all zeros.

01:18:18.570 --> 01:18:21.340
The decoder also fills it up
with all zeros, because this

01:18:21.340 --> 01:18:23.750
is the way you always start.

01:18:23.750 --> 01:18:25.840
And then you just start running
a log, looking for

01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:28.300
matches and encoding things.

01:18:28.300 --> 01:18:35.530
And as w builds up, you
start matching things.

01:18:35.530 --> 01:18:38.320
You could even be smarter, and
know that you're window wasn't

01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:41.780
very big and let your
window grow also.

01:18:41.780 --> 01:18:45.990
If you wanted to really
be fancy about this.

01:18:45.990 --> 01:18:48.880
So if you want to encode this
you can have a lot of fun, and

01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:51.600
a lot of people over the years
have had a lot of fun trying

01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:53.570
to encode these things.

01:18:53.570 --> 01:18:54.820
It's a neat thing to do.
