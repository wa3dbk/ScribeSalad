00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:27.930
PROFESSOR: The CDMA and the
cellular standard, the IS95,

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.080
which is a kind of an old
standard by now, but it's

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.280
still widely used.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.190
There's still three major
standards that are used for

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.920
cellular communication, cellular
voice communication.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.510
This is one of them.

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.190
This is the one which is
primarily being used as a

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.090
jumping off point for all of the
new standards that people

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:51.820
are trying to think of.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.640
I want to talk about it for that
reason but also because

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.850
it really is a nice way of
pulling together almost

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.150
everything we talked about
in the course.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.760
All of it comes into this one
particular way of sending

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.470
cellular voice.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.030
Let's go through some of
the details of it.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.910
Some things here might sound
more detailed than what you're

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.710
interested in but I think it's
good to have the numbers on it

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.540
because it gives you some idea
of which things, which factors

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.600
are really relevant and which
ones aren't so relevant.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.570
So it uses a frequency ban from
800 to 900 megahertz.

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.830
Most of the new standards that
people are thinking up are up

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.340
in the gigahertz range
around two gigahertz

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.070
or five or six gigahertz.

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.080
I don't know the exact
bandwidths.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.330
All of these bandwidths depend
critically on what the FCC

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:59.610
wants to allocate and also
depend critically one which

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.240
particular bands are good for
electromagnetic propagation

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.790
and which ones tend to absorb
all of the radiation.

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:13.930
Anyway, you use the band 800 to
850 for the reverse channel

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.990
for the cell phone to the base
and you use the band 850 to

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.130
900 for the forward channel.

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.600
Why do you want to separate the
reverse channels and the

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.740
forward channels by as
much as you can?

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.460
If you think for just a minute
about the power levels at your

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:38.770
sending antenna, either at the
base station or at the cell

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.730
phone itself, and then you think
about how much power

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.860
you're receiving, he see there's
an enormous difference

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.300
between these two.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.590
Because things get attenuated
enormously after they got

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:51.690
transmitted.

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.830
So what you're trying to do is
to filter out what you're

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.750
sending, which is an enormously
high power and you

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.260
have to filter it out by enough
so that it doesn't

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.510
clobber what you're
trying to receive.

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.250
This means you need
very good filters.

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.740
How do you build very
good filters?

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.750
It's a lot easier to build good
filters if you're not

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.560
trying to make them cut
off immediately.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.610
If you have 50 megahertz, and
you actually have a lot more

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:27.470
than that, you have exactly 50
megahertz because this is all

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.280
separated into a bunch of
different channels.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.100
People in wireless, most
practical communicators, when

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.970
they talk about a channel, what
they're talking about is

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:39.460
a particular bandwidth.

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:43.690
All along what we've been
talking about is a particular

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.350
medium going from transmitter
to receiver.

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.450
That's what they're talking
about is these channels, these

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.860
channels or sub-bands are 1.25
megahertz wide each.

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.360
We'll see what the
significance of

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.530
that is in a while.

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:04.550
So you have a transmit and
receive pair which are both

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:09.350
1.25 megahertz wide and which
are separated by 50 megahertz.

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.990
So you have one channel then,
at the bottom of the range,

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:14.760
another channel a little bit
higher, another channel, a

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.440
little bit higher, and so
forth all the way up.

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.460
So you have lots of different
channels and you put lots of

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:24.450
different cell phones in each
channel for each base station.

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:29.110
So that's roughly the overall
architecture of it.

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.260
It's the same kind of system
that we've been

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.510
talking about all along.

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.480
You start out with voice wave
forms, you have voice

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:36.400
compression.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.200
You then have channel coding,
you then have modulation and

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.100
then it goes out
on the channel.

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.940
Guess what happens when
it comes back?

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:50.090
You have demodulation, channel
decoding, and then you turn it

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.310
back into voice.

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:57.330
Those are the three major steps
which we viewed before

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.410
primarily as two steps.

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:02.950
All of the channel stuff is much
harder than all of the

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:04.850
source stuff.

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:08.270
Let's talk about the
source stuff first.

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.830
The input voice gets segmented
into these

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.820
20 millisecond segments.

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.300
Why 20 milliseconds?

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.610
Well it sort of seems like it's
probably a number that

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:22.470
somebody picked out of a hat.

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:24.710
It's kind of striking that
all of the standards

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:27.110
use the same interval.

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:31.600
If you think about
it awhile --

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.340
I'll talk about this more
on the next slide --

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.200
the reason for this interval
is that in voice

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.810
communication, delay is
enormously important.

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:44.665
You don't want to have much
delay and since you don't want

00:05:44.665 --> 00:05:47.940
to have much delay, you
have to do encoding

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.400
over very short segments.

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:55.150
Well anyway, what this does is
it takes each 20 millisecond

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:59.410
segment of voice and it
maps it into 172 bits.

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:07.040
What that means is if you
multiply the 172 by the 50

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:12.410
segments that you have per
second, it comes out to be 8.6

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:14.360
kilobits per second.

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:18.400
That might not sound like
much of an achievement.

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.470
Think about the old fashioned
way that people used to encode

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:27.730
voice back in a time when they
were first doing digital

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:28.980
communication.

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:33.650
What you would was you would
think of the voice as having a

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:36.710
bandwidth that went from
about 400 hertz up

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:38.940
to about 3,200 hertz.

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.960
You would then view it as a base
band wave form zero to

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.730
4,000 hertz.

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:47.580
If you were going to try to
sample that wave form you'd

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:51.010
have to sample it 8,000
times per second.

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:54.910
If you want good quality, you
then have to use a large

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:57.030
number bits.

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:59.940
You need a large number of
bits for each sample.

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:02.840
The standard thing was to use
eight bits per sample.

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:08.210
That gave you 64,000 bits per
second in the old fashioned

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:09.160
way of doing it.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.980
People have worked
for many years.

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:18.060
Many engineers at the old Bell
labs spent their whole career

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:21.880
trying to find out how to
compress voice into smaller

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:24.920
and smaller numbers of bits.

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:29.610
You know, 8.6 kilobits
per second is still

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:32.010
sort of a good rate.

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:36.000
It's still a good rate if you
insist that you have to do it

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.480
in 20 millisecond segments.

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:42.220
If you can take much longer
segments to encode voice, you

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:44.610
can do much better.

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:48.510
Voice really has a lot of
constraints over relatively

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:50.420
long periods of time.

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:57.990
Well actually, you know this
because if you take a person's

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:02.360
voice and you map it into text
and then you also add a few

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:06.010
things about pitch and things
like that, you can really come

00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:08.470
by with a very small
number of bits.

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:10.930
Here you're constraining
yourself to something that

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:15.160
sounds like the actual voice
and also has to be done in

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:18.270
these 20 millisecond segments
because of delay.

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:21.420
So it still is a reasonably
good achievement.

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:24.780
All of the standards have
figures about like this, in

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:26.560
the same order of magnitude.

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:28.300
I expect that all of
the new standards

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:29.920
will do similar things.

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:31.440
They will probably
have slightly

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:33.170
smaller numbers of bits.

00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:36.220
They will probably do much
more computation.

00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:38.920
They will achieve a little
bit more because

00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:39.890
this was already --

00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:42.780
I think --

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:46.710
relatively close to how
far you can go.

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:48.700
The next thing they
do is they add 12

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:50.300
parity checks per segment.

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:52.410
They use that for
error detection.

00:08:52.410 --> 00:08:55.340
I don't want to talk about that
a lot because it probably

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:57.370
isn't necessary.

00:08:57.370 --> 00:09:00.690
All of the standards do
something or other like this.

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:04.700
The reason is, if you take this
20 millisecond segment

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:07.530
and you go through all of this
enormous processing that we're

00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:11.070
going to go through: namely
turning it into an encoded

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:15.390
wave form, transmitting it,
receiving it, detecting it,

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:17.720
doing all the stuff we're
going to do to it.

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:21.800
If you get the 20 millisecond
segment confused, and usually

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:25.970
if you make errors you
make a lot of errors.

00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:29.260
If at the receiver you wind up
with the wrong thing, it is

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.420
really going to sound awful.

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:34.370
They found that it's much better
if you're not quite

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:38.220
sure of what that segment is,
to just send silence for 20

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:39.540
milliseconds.

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:42.160
The silence is hardly detectable
at all; it just

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:45.080
sounds like good voice.

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:47.580
I mean for most of us it really
sound wonderful to have

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:50.310
a little more silence
than we usually do.

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:53.370
Well enough of that.

00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:54.350
Then there's another thing.

00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:58.120
This is eight zeros per segments
that are added to

00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:04.790
this 172 bits as something which
is called a terminator

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:06.660
for the convolutional code.

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:09.290
I might say a little bit about
that but not much.

00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:11.890
So what we've done is to
add 12 bits and eight

00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:15.460
bits to this 172 bits.

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:21.520
That brings us up to 192 bits,
which brings us up to 9,600

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:24.590
bits per second which
is what we're now

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:26.440
going to try to transmit.

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:30.220
OK so that's the voice
compression part of the thing

00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:32.820
and a little bits of
overhead done for

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:34.300
various special functions.

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:39.050
The main reason I want to talk
about these overhead factors

00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:46.100
is that every communication
system I know starts out with

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:49.920
very nice principles studying
very carefully what are the

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:51.680
essential things.

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:54.830
By the time you got done with
it, there are all sorts of

00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:58.340
little overhead items that got
thrown in to make the thing

00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:01.190
work and it's frustrating
to everybody.

00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:06.060
It's usually 10% or 20% of the
capacity of the thing, but

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:08.030
it's always there.

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:10.550
That's why I bring up these
two terms because that's

00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:13.470
exactly the kind of things
they're doing.

00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:16.390
They're just patching
to make things work.

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:20.160
So you have many details that
lose all of the efficiency

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:21.550
that you would like to have.

00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:26.270
Those are what makes it hard to
compare different systems.

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:30.150
Each system, architecturally
nice though it might be to

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:33.620
start with, always winds up
with these little things

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:37.000
because of these silly little
constraints that say, since

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.250
you have to have small delay,
you have to segment voice into

00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:42.920
segments which are not
much more than 20

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:44.640
milliseconds long.

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:47.950
Those things cause you to
do these other things.

00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:52.210
That's where all of
this comes in.

00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:57.960
OK, all of the timing in this
IS95 cell phone system,

00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:02.440
everything is keyed to this
9,600 bits per second and it's

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:06.470
all keyed through this 20
millisecond interval.

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:10.520
Everything is done in terms of
20 millisecond intervals.

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:12.980
It's all a completely
block system.

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:16.610
The source generates 20
milliseconds worth of data.

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:19.580
You encode that into
a 192 bits.

00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:22.740
That gets mapped into some code
word, gets turned into

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:25.520
some high frequency wave form.

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:29.180
At the output you look at 20
milliseconds and that gets

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:34.050
turned back into your best hope
of the 172 bits that you

00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:38.160
started with and from there
to some wave form.

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:41.450
Every 20 milliseconds is
completely independent of

00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:43.380
every other 20 milliseconds.

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:45.550
You don't even save any
knowledge about what the

00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:48.610
channel is between those
periods of time.

00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:51.060
Everything is independent
from one to the next.

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:58.330
The point is here, we talked
a great deal about all of

00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:04.010
digital communication sort of
being generated from people's

00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:08.470
realization that they ought to
separate voice coding from

00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:09.230
channel coding.

00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:12.560
In other words, there's just
binary interface between all

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:15.010
sources and all channels.

00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:18.920
This is a violation
of that; all cell

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:21.810
phones have this violation.

00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:25.880
They don't have this pure
separation because all of them

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:29.890
face the fact that to do this
small delay -- anytime you

00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:33.660
want to get small delay -- you
have to have some mixing of

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:35.460
what you do with the
source and what

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:37.240
you do with the channel.

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:40.600
The delay has to be some
combination of what happens in

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:41.850
both places.

00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:47.380
So, we do have that violation
and it's because of

00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:50.130
interactive voice.

00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:53.210
You probably never thought about
why it is that you need

00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:55.910
small delay on voice.

00:13:55.910 --> 00:14:00.800
If you try to talk to somebody
with a 50 millisecond delay,

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:03.760
in between what you're saying
and what the other person is

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:07.890
saying, you will find it turns
you into a stutter in about

00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:11.380
five minutes, everyone.

00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:14.090
The problem is we all have these
social conventions that

00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:18.280
we use to tell us when we can
start to talk when we hear

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:20.900
silence from the other person.

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:23.520
If you have a break in that
routine, even at 50

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:27.280
milliseconds, it totally
screws it up.

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:31.620
Both people start to talk at
the same time and it's very

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:33.570
hard to have a conversation.

00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:37.540
Back in the early days of
telephony, they found that

00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:40.950
about as much delay as they
could tolerate was about 20

00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:42.130
milliseconds.

00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:44.760
When it got much longer than
that, it gets very

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:46.070
objectionable.

00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:49.790
If you talk to somebody on the
phone who is in Japan, you

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:52.370
have a little more
delay than that.

00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:54.440
You find it's very hard
to talk to them.

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:56.460
I mean, you have to practice
a little bit, you have

00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:57.790
to think about it.

00:14:57.790 --> 00:15:01.660
If it's somebody for whom
English is a second language,

00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:03.500
or you have Japanese
as a second

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:05.860
language, it's very easy.

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:10.620
Then you both talk very slowly
so you catch up on that delay.

00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:10.760
but.

00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:14.370
If you're both talking English
very rapidly, or both Japanese

00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:17.030
very rapidly, it becomes
hell on wheels.

00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:23.450
As far as the channel is
concerned, we could also do

00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:27.060
very well by using longer code
words on the channel.

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:29.430
Again, we're stuck by this
20 milliseconds.

00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:35.730
Everything has to be blocked
into 20 millisecond periods.

00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:40.300
OK, so the first thing as far
as coding is concerned, is

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:43.530
what's called a convolutional
encoder.

00:15:43.530 --> 00:15:46.210
We unfortunately, have not
talked about coding at all in

00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:48.600
this course; we're not going
to talk about it.

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:54.550
I just want to enough about
convolutional codes so you get

00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:57.400
some idea of what they are.

00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:02.880
Here's the simplest example of
a convolutional code that I

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:04.530
think you can think of.

00:16:04.530 --> 00:16:09.080
You have a stream of input bits
which are coming in one

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:11.500
per second.

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:15.890
Each time an input bit comes
in, that input bit sits at

00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:17.710
this dock here.

00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:20.260
I guess most people would prefer
to put an extra memory

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:24.000
element in but it just
complicates the diagram.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.260
You have this input bit, you
have the previous input bit,

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:30.930
and you have the input
bit before that.

00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:35.700
What comes out, a time J is a
linear combination of this

00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:39.960
bit, that previous bit, and the
bit one bit before that.

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:44.220
You call this a convolutional
code with a constraint length

00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:47.800
of two because it has memory
of these two bits.

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:52.180
If you think about it a little
bit, this is a device that has

00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:54.690
four states.

00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:59.880
OK, because at time J, it needs
to remember whether this

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:02.730
bit was a one or a zero
and whether this bit

00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:04.790
was a one or a zero.

00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:09.170
So it's just a linear modulo
two device that happens to

00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:10.780
have four states.

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:15.060
It produces two bits in each
interval of time which are

00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:17.920
functions of this bit and
of the current state.

00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:26.020
In this convolutional encoder
which is used in IS95, the

00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:28.850
constraint length is eight
instead of two.

00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:34.310
In other words, you have 8 of
these memory devices here and

00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:37.810
the rate is one-third instead of
one-half Here you have two

00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:40.670
bits coming out for
each bit going in.

00:17:40.670 --> 00:17:43.090
There you have three
bits coming out for

00:17:43.090 --> 00:17:44.550
each bit going in.

00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:46.500
It's the same principle.

00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:55.660
If you think about it a little
bit, as you increase the

00:17:55.660 --> 00:18:00.020
constraint length, the number
of possible states that you

00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:03.680
have is going up very rapidly.

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:06.490
So, if you have a constraint
length of eight, which means

00:18:06.490 --> 00:18:09.550
eight binary digits stored
there, you have two to the

00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:14.310
eighth different states,
which is 256 states.

00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:17.600
If you added one more state to
this thing, you would double

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:18.850
the complexity.

00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:24.420
Well, it turns out that because
of the way the decoder

00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:28.800
works, if you added one more bit
to this block length, it

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:31.180
would multiply the complexity
of the decoder

00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:34.430
by a factor of two.

00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:37.300
So, when you try to decide how
long these constraint lengths

00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:41.250
should be, you have to take into
account that every time

00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:43.840
you make it one bit longer,
yes, the thing is going to

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:45.600
work better.

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:50.300
Also, you make it twice
as complex.

00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:52.790
Therefore, you have to wait
another six months before you

00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:54.640
produce it at the same cost.

00:18:58.110 --> 00:19:00.210
OK, we're going to
use a Viterbi

00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:02.430
algorithm for decoding.

00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:07.600
If you don't know what the
Viterbi algorithm is fine.

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:11.890
If you think in terms of finite
state devices, think of

00:19:11.890 --> 00:19:17.160
it this way; you have a device
here which has four states.

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:22.010
Somehow the decoder has to
realize at each instant of

00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:25.950
time, if it's gonna decode,
it could either

00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:29.000
decode the bits here.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.800
A nicer way to think of it is,
it decodes the state, at each

00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:34.520
instant of time.

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:37.200
If it decodes the state at
each instant of time, it

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:39.690
doesn't really have to
have any memory.

00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:42.830
As soon as it knows what the
state is at one unit of time,

00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:46.610
then it has a very simple
decision to make to figure out

00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:50.400
what the incoming bit is and
what the state is at the next

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:51.600
instant of time.

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:55.070
And what a Viterbi decoder is,
is something that does maximum

00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:59.620
likelihood decisions
on the state.

00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:02.950
There's a nice trellis diagram
to talk about how that's done,

00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:03.510
in the notes.

00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:05.760
You can read about it,
it's interesting.

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:08.760
Many of you who have probably
seen about it, it's sort of

00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:11.860
the easiest thing to
explain, as far as

00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:13.560
coding theory is concerned.

00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:16.810
It's the easiest thing to
explain until you put all the

00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:19.310
notation in.

00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:21.750
Then whoever does it, as soon
as they put all of the

00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:24.890
notation in, it becomes
a bloody mess.

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:26.240
Anyway, the idea is simple.

00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:36.100
So at that point, we can sort
of summarize what we've done

00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:39.550
as far as waste compression
and channel coding.

00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:44.940
So far, the IS95 standard is
pretty much the same as any

00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:47.020
other cellular standard.

00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:49.800
All of them, it turns out,
use convolutional codes.

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:53.190
Whether that's a good idea or
not is another question, but

00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:56.260
they all do.

00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:59.660
It certainly is a very
sensible thing to do.

00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:03.370
All of them use the
same segmentation.

00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:08.190
All of them use similar
techniques for doing voice

00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:09.750
compression.

00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:11.410
All of them have all these
little overhead

00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:13.850
terms that come in.

00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:18.710
If you look at the numbers of
what's going on, we started

00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:22.340
out with a 172 bits per second,
which was what comes

00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:24.790
out of the voice compressor.

00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:27.610
You then have these two
overhead items.

00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:31.500
Incidentally this eight bit
convolutional terminator, we

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:35.400
can now get some idea
of what that's for.

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:39.780
You put in your 172 bits here.

00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:42.680
You're thinking of this thing in
terms of the state of each

00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:44.660
unit of time.

00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:47.780
If you're going to figure out
what's going on at the end,

00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:53.610
after you put in your 172 bits,
you have to put in a

00:21:53.610 --> 00:21:58.330
couple of extra zeros to let
this thing settle down.

00:21:58.330 --> 00:22:01.550
You have to let this bit go
all the way through this

00:22:01.550 --> 00:22:04.840
device so you got enough
data out about it that

00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:06.050
you can decode it.

00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:09.860
So that's what that terminator
is for, for putting zeros in

00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:13.580
at the end of the sequence so
you can view it all as one

00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:14.830
block code.

00:22:18.090 --> 00:22:21.300
Again, this is overhead, which
is caused by the need for

00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:22.190
small delay.

00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:25.380
If you're going to need small
delay, that overhead term

00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:27.730
would be much, much smaller.

00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:31.820
So at that point, we're up to
9.6 kilobits per second and

00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:34.690
we're up 192 bits per segment.

00:22:34.690 --> 00:22:38.210
Then we go into this
convolutional encoder and the

00:22:38.210 --> 00:22:41.830
convolutional encoder
multiplies things

00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:44.130
by a factor of three.

00:22:44.130 --> 00:22:47.170
In fact, the rate one-third is
a little bit different for

00:22:47.170 --> 00:22:50.430
most of the other standards
because one of the things that

00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:55.660
we're going to be doing here,
since we're mapping this input

00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:58.950
into one and a quarter mega
bits, that's a considerably

00:22:58.950 --> 00:23:01.690
broader band than these
other standards used.

00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:05.710
The other standards are quite
narrow band and therefore they

00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:11.490
don't want to have a large
number of bits per second.

00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:18.010
Here we're going to wind up
talking about 28.8 kilobits

00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:23.780
per second at this point which
is 576 bits per second, which

00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:26.910
is three times what we
started out with.

00:23:26.910 --> 00:23:31.050
We've expanded the number of
bits by a factor of three.

00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:35.200
If you question whether this
makes sense to get a slightly

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:39.370
smaller error probability
through coding but increasing

00:23:39.370 --> 00:23:43.680
your rate by a factor of three,
that's a perfectly

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:46.790
sensible question to ask.

00:23:46.790 --> 00:23:50.490
It just turns out that you do
get a saving from that and

00:23:50.490 --> 00:23:53.640
that's what all of coding theory
is about, how much

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:55.950
savings you actually get.

00:23:55.950 --> 00:23:58.940
In fact, the savings are
pretty considerable.

00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:03.060
So, at this point, we're up
here at 28.8 kilobits per

00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:08.030
second with 578, 576
bits per segment.

00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:10.270
We then go through
an interleaver.

00:24:10.270 --> 00:24:13.010
Don't ask yet what the
interleaver is for.

00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:17.510
All the interleaver does is
takes these 576 bits and it's

00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:19.390
scrambles them all around.

00:24:19.390 --> 00:24:22.910
The receiver knows how they've
been scramble so the receiver

00:24:22.910 --> 00:24:24.660
can unscramble them again.

00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:28.400
Why you'd need that is something
we will talk about

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:29.910
later, a good deal later.

00:24:33.870 --> 00:24:36.980
The next thing we're going to
do, you thought you were

00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:38.320
through with coding but no.

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:41.540
In this system, they're actually
two stages of coding

00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:42.980
that you go through.

00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:47.190
You can view one of them as
modulation instead of coding.

00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:49.670
Therefore, you can claim you're
only doing one stage of

00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:54.070
coding and one stage of fairly
complex modulation.

00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:56.990
You remember when we talked
about orthogonal codewords.

00:24:56.990 --> 00:25:01.200
We said we could view orthogonal
codewords almost as

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:04.920
easily, either as a coding
technique or as

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:06.360
a modulation technique.

00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:09.240
Mainly, you'd gather together
lots of bits and then you'd

00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:13.330
form codewords, which we're
signals, which had a large

00:25:13.330 --> 00:25:15.440
number of dimensions in them.

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:18.880
We're going to do the
same thing here.

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:23.530
We are going to take this
interleaver output; we're

00:25:23.530 --> 00:25:27.260
going to segment it into
six, six bit blocks.

00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:31.600
Then each six bit block is going
to choose one of a set

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:35.650
of 64 orthogonal codewords.

00:25:35.650 --> 00:25:38.350
I mean, with six bits, you have
two to the sixth, which

00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:40.750
is 64 different combinations.

00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:43.300
So, if you're going to use
orthogonal codewords, you need

00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:45.760
64 of them.

00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:48.660
When we were talking about
orthogonal codewords before,

00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:51.910
we didn't quite know how
to generate them.

00:25:51.910 --> 00:25:55.630
We then said last time, that may
be using PN sequences is a

00:25:55.630 --> 00:25:57.170
nice way of doing it.

00:25:57.170 --> 00:25:59.790
That's not quite exact.

00:25:59.790 --> 00:26:02.910
Here using Hadamard matrices
is a nice exact

00:26:02.910 --> 00:26:04.610
way of doing it.

00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:09.340
That happens to be the way it's
done and it's simple.

00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:15.140
I mean, you have a Hadamard
matrix for each integer b.

00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:18.470
If you start out with b equals
one, which is one bit that you

00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:21.450
want to encode.

00:26:21.450 --> 00:26:24.390
You have a matrix which consists
of 2 orthogonal

00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:28.810
codewords one of which is 0,
0 and the other is 0, 1.

00:26:28.810 --> 00:26:30.900
There aren't too many choices
for that and they're all

00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:33.100
equivalent.

00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:36.740
Then when you want to go to b
equals two, the thing you'd do

00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:39.490
is make a matrix and the rows of
the matrix are going to be

00:26:39.490 --> 00:26:40.740
the codewords.

00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:48.020
The columns correspond to the
bits in the codeword.

00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:52.740
The first codeword here is 0,
0 second codeword is 0, 1.

00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:56.210
The first codeword here
is 0, 0, 0, 0 the next

00:26:56.210 --> 00:26:58.050
one is 0, 1, 0, 1.

00:26:58.050 --> 00:27:01.330
For orthogonal codes, the block
lengths of the code and

00:27:01.330 --> 00:27:04.130
the number of codewords is
going to be the same.

00:27:04.130 --> 00:27:06.950
So the thing you'd do is you
take this matrix, you put it

00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:09.910
there, you put it there,
and you put it there.

00:27:09.910 --> 00:27:13.680
Then you compliment the matrix
and you put it there.

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:16.040
OK why does that work?

00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:19.250
Well if we just look at this
part of it, this was an

00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:23.010
orthogonal code, this was
an orthogonal code.

00:27:23.010 --> 00:27:33.170
In other words, each of them
differ from each of the others

00:27:33.170 --> 00:27:35.840
in half the positions, which
is why you think of it as

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:37.670
being orthogonal.

00:27:37.670 --> 00:27:43.010
This is the confusion that
runs through all of

00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:44.260
communication theory.

00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:47.720
We might as well get rid of
that confusion right now.

00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:51.410
When you talk about binary
sequences and you say they're

00:27:51.410 --> 00:27:55.750
orthogonal, what you mean is, if
you turn that sequence into

00:27:55.750 --> 00:28:01.310
a 2PAM signal, those
corresponding signals are

00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:02.250
orthogonal.

00:28:02.250 --> 00:28:07.020
In other words, an orthogonal
binary sequence, an orthogonal

00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:11.800
set of binary sequences is a set
of binary sequences where

00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:14.540
each of the sequences differ
from each of the other

00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:19.280
sequences in half of
the positions.

00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:22.380
Here with these Hadamard
matrices, the way that's done

00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:25.790
is that one of the sequences
is always all zero and the

00:28:25.790 --> 00:28:30.590
other sequences are all half
ones and half zeros.

00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:35.330
It turns out that when you add
any two sequences, add this

00:28:35.330 --> 00:28:39.680
sequence to this sequence for
example, you got something

00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:41.140
else, which is half ones .

00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:45.610
In fact, something else which is
in there, is what's called

00:28:45.610 --> 00:28:47.670
a group code.

00:28:47.670 --> 00:28:51.740
When you add any two codewords
you got another code.

00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:55.680
Anyway, when you look at this,
which is mapped into

00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:59.140
here and here --

00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:03.980
I think the argument is
difficult here because it's

00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:07.860
too simple minded, so you
don't see it in it's

00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:12.520
generality -- each time you go
from one b to the next b, the

00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:13.980
thing you do is the
same thing.

00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:17.410
You start out with this matrix,
put it there, you put

00:29:17.410 --> 00:29:19.600
it there, you put it there,
and you put the

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:22.270
complement of it there.

00:29:22.270 --> 00:29:24.770
What that does is when you look
at the first half of the

00:29:24.770 --> 00:29:29.670
matrix, all of these differ in
half the positions because

00:29:29.670 --> 00:29:32.070
they differ in half the
positions here, and they

00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:33.970
differ in half the
positions here.

00:29:33.970 --> 00:29:37.570
So, they differ in half the
positions over all.

00:29:37.570 --> 00:29:40.980
When you look at everything down
here, they differ in half

00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:44.100
the positions for the same
reason because complementing

00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:47.570
this doesn't change any of those
distance properties.

00:29:47.570 --> 00:29:49.510
When you look at the difference
between these and

00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:52.520
these, it's the same kind of
thing if you think about it

00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:55.500
for a couple of minutes.

00:29:55.500 --> 00:30:00.400
So, this is an orthogonal
code.

00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:03.340
Why do we want to use this
orthogonal code rather than

00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:07.520
just an orthogonal code which
uses the first degree of

00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:09.710
freedom and sends an enormous
amount of energy?

00:30:09.710 --> 00:30:14.110
Or the second degree of freedom
sends an enormous

00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:15.820
amount of energy and so forth?

00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:18.690
That's the same thing we were
talking about last time with

00:30:18.690 --> 00:30:20.310
regard to channel measurement.

00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:23.420
You don't want to send enormous
amounts of energy in

00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:24.840
any one degree of freedom.

00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:28.580
You want to spread it out over
all the degrees of freedom.

00:30:28.580 --> 00:30:31.820
That's what all these codes are
doing; all these codes are

00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:36.130
using 2PAM on each
degree of freedom

00:30:36.130 --> 00:30:37.600
to generate a codeword.

00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:43.102
So the codewords all have sort
of uniform power in them.

00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:52.870
OK, so at this point, we have
gone into this orthogonal code

00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:57.610
generator with 28.8 kilobits
per second.

00:30:57.610 --> 00:31:02.950
We have come out of it with 28.8
kilobits per second times

00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:04.420
64 over six.

00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:08.770
Namely for each six bit
segment in, we've

00:31:08.770 --> 00:31:11.440
gotten 64 bits out.

00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:14.900
So the total number of bits that
we have has gone up by a

00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:18.270
factor of 64 divided by six.

00:31:18.270 --> 00:31:23.660
So we're suddenly up to 307.2
kilobits per second.

00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:26.900
What we're trying to do is get
ourselves -- by hook or by

00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:30.300
crook -- get ourselves up from
these very small bit rates

00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:33.860
that we need to represent voice,
up to these large bit

00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:38.970
rates, 1.25 megabits per second,
which we're going to

00:31:38.970 --> 00:31:41.780
spread this wave form to.

00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:45.430
All the reasons we want to
spread the wave form, I'll

00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:47.190
talk about them later.

00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:50.330
For now let's just think about
it as saying, somehow or other

00:31:50.330 --> 00:31:54.300
we want to spread the wave
form out and turn a small

00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:56.770
number of bits into a large
number of bits.

00:31:56.770 --> 00:31:58.690
So we've done a pretty
significant part

00:31:58.690 --> 00:32:00.840
of that right here.

00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:03.830
If we think of turning these
binary rows of the Hadamard

00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:09.450
matrix and modulate them
by 2PAM we wind

00:32:09.450 --> 00:32:11.080
up with wave forms.

00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:13.760
The wave forms are orthogonal.

00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:16.300
If you wanted to think of taking
these wave forms and

00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:20.290
then transmitting them up to
passband, we would wind up

00:32:20.290 --> 00:32:26.760
with the bandwidth
of 307,000 hertz.

00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:32.620
That's not enough yet, we want
to go up to 1.25 megahertz.

00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:35.990
Anyway, these wave forms are
called Walsh functions.

00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:40.290
So the wave forms that you got
from Hadamard matrices are

00:32:40.290 --> 00:32:42.130
called Walsh functions.

00:32:42.130 --> 00:32:45.450
You have to find something to
honor everybody that's done a

00:32:45.450 --> 00:32:48.710
significant amount in this field
and Walsh was one of

00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:50.600
these people.

00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:54.330
Walsh functions are quite famous
and all they are are

00:32:54.330 --> 00:32:57.490
just these orthogonal
wave forms.

00:32:57.490 --> 00:33:02.060
So, we now have an orthogonal
code of length 64.

00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:03.960
The receiver, I'm going
to talk about the

00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:06.130
receiver more later.

00:33:06.130 --> 00:33:10.190
In essence, what it's going to
do is take the 64 orthogonal

00:33:10.190 --> 00:33:16.170
wave forms, only one of them
will get transmitted in each

00:33:16.170 --> 00:33:18.290
of these small units of time.

00:33:18.290 --> 00:33:21.820
When the period of time
corresponding to six bits into

00:33:21.820 --> 00:33:25.870
the encoder, we have to decode
which of these 64

00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:27.600
wave forms was sent.

00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:31.230
We're going to do that by
using a rake receiver.

00:33:31.230 --> 00:33:34.080
That's what's used in IS95.

00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:36.360
This rake receiver is different
from the one we

00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:37.070
talked about.

00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:40.410
The one we talked about, we were
making a decision between

00:33:40.410 --> 00:33:42.310
two hypotheses.

00:33:42.310 --> 00:33:45.580
Here we're making a decision
between 64 possible

00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:46.830
hypotheses.

00:33:48.670 --> 00:33:51.040
If you can remember the
structure of that rake

00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:55.520
receiver, it sort of split into
two separate sections.

00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:58.710
One section was used for the
decision on one of the wave

00:33:58.710 --> 00:34:01.790
forms, the other one, on
the other wave form.

00:34:01.790 --> 00:34:06.140
When we do this with 64 wave
forms, it spreads into 64

00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:08.420
different sections,
which is why it's

00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:11.860
called the rake receiver.

00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:14.990
If you draw a picture of
it looks like a rake.

00:34:14.990 --> 00:34:17.700
You start out here with the
handle and then you have it

00:34:17.700 --> 00:34:22.410
spread out into 64 different
tines and all of these tines

00:34:22.410 --> 00:34:26.290
have all of this signal
processing going on.

00:34:26.290 --> 00:34:30.490
At the output you come back and
you change what your model

00:34:30.490 --> 00:34:34.200
of the channel is depending on
the actual decision that

00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:35.450
you've made.

00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:42.370
So what we're using is a rake
receiver but a rake receiver

00:34:42.370 --> 00:34:49.400
which has 64 decision devices
instead of two.

00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:52.980
Suppose we go into an orthogonal
code using seven

00:34:52.980 --> 00:34:56.610
bits instead of six bits.

00:34:56.610 --> 00:35:00.350
Now, at this point, you're
talking about real money.

00:35:00.350 --> 00:35:03.350
OK, because at this point,
you're talking about taking

00:35:03.350 --> 00:35:09.900
this rake receiver and turning
it from 64 arms into 128 arms.

00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:11.860
Now, you can do that because
these things are essentially

00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:15.730
free now and computation
is essentially free.

00:35:15.730 --> 00:35:18.980
At the time when this was
designed, there was a very

00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:23.590
hard constraint in terms of
complexity about how many bits

00:35:23.590 --> 00:35:27.700
they can encode together into
orthogonal wave forms.

00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:30.040
I'll show you why
in a little bit.

00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:32.770
It wouldn't have done them much
better to have a larger

00:35:32.770 --> 00:35:34.900
set of orthogonal wave
forms anyway.

00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:45.540
It also uses incoherent soft
decisions as a way of doing

00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:46.400
its detection.

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:49.970
We talked about incoherent
detection.

00:35:49.970 --> 00:35:53.140
This rake receiver uses that
instead of the coherent

00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:56.260
detection that we talked
about in class.

00:35:56.260 --> 00:35:59.930
If you just put together in
your mind, the lecture we

00:35:59.930 --> 00:36:03.320
spent talking about rake
receivers and the one we spent

00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:06.820
talking about incoherent
detection and you put them

00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:11.260
together, you have what this
receiver is doing.

00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:13.140
I'll talk about just a
little more as we go.

00:36:17.410 --> 00:36:23.890
OK, if we now imagine these are
orthogonal codewords and

00:36:23.890 --> 00:36:26.660
suppose that each orthogonal
codeword has an

00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:30.790
energy e sub s.

00:36:30.790 --> 00:36:34.160
Suppose for the time being
that the channel is

00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:38.830
represented perfectly by a
single-tap model and we know

00:36:38.830 --> 00:36:41.640
what the energy in that
single-tap model is.

00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:45.710
We don't know what the
phase so we're

00:36:45.710 --> 00:36:49.170
using incoherent detection.

00:36:49.170 --> 00:36:51.810
What's the error probability?

00:36:51.810 --> 00:36:56.030
Well the error probability for
an incoherent receiver for

00:36:56.030 --> 00:37:01.390
making a decision between two
possibilities was one-half

00:37:01.390 --> 00:37:06.310
times e to the minus energy
divided by 2 N 0.

00:37:06.310 --> 00:37:09.400
Here we have 64 different
possibilities.

00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:13.320
So we're going to transmit one
of these wave forms and we now

00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:17.030
use the union band to say
there's this probability of

00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:21.730
error to each of the other
63 possible wave forms.

00:37:21.730 --> 00:37:24.090
we could make an error
to any one of them.

00:37:24.090 --> 00:37:26.750
That's equally likely to make
an error to any one of them

00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:28.930
because they're each orthogonal
to the one that

00:37:28.930 --> 00:37:30.410
we're dealing with.

00:37:30.410 --> 00:37:32.930
So this is a reasonably good
bound on the error

00:37:32.930 --> 00:37:35.070
probability.

00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:39.210
OK, now you go back from this to
look at the reason why, one

00:37:39.210 --> 00:37:42.120
of the main reasons why
you want to do this.

00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:46.180
E sub s is the amount of energy
you use to transmit six

00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:49.500
bits instead of one bit.

00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:52.140
Therefore, when you look at the
energy per bit that you're

00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:55.670
using, it's e sub s
divided by six.

00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:59.550
So, your probability of error,
-- if in fact you were making

00:37:59.550 --> 00:38:03.850
hard decisions at the output of
this incoherent detector --

00:38:03.850 --> 00:38:07.930
would be in the order of 63 over
2 times e to the minus

00:38:07.930 --> 00:38:10.610
3eb over N0.

00:38:10.610 --> 00:38:15.690
This is a considerably larger
exponent and therefore, a

00:38:15.690 --> 00:38:18.890
considerably lower error
probability than we were

00:38:18.890 --> 00:38:20.860
getting when we were
talking about

00:38:20.860 --> 00:38:22.970
transmitting single bits.

00:38:22.970 --> 00:38:26.390
In other words, the same thing
is going on here as was going

00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:29.390
on when we were talking about
getting up the channel

00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:33.680
capacity using a large number
of orthogonal wave forms.

00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:35.110
It's the same idea.

00:38:35.110 --> 00:38:39.540
When you encode lots of bits
together, you make a joint

00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:44.310
decision on all of them,
you make a gain.

00:38:44.310 --> 00:38:46.570
That's exactly what's
happening here.

00:38:46.570 --> 00:38:51.330
You made a gain because you've
taken the amount of energy

00:38:51.330 --> 00:38:54.570
that you have available for
each one of your bits and

00:38:54.570 --> 00:38:57.510
you've combined it all
so that you get this

00:38:57.510 --> 00:39:00.290
bigger exponent in here.

00:39:00.290 --> 00:39:02.700
If you're lucky, the exponent
is big enough that it

00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:09.070
overwhelms this term and your
decision comes out with very

00:39:09.070 --> 00:39:10.730
small error probability.

00:39:10.730 --> 00:39:13.980
Well, as it turns out, we're not
interested in making these

00:39:13.980 --> 00:39:15.130
hard decisions.

00:39:15.130 --> 00:39:20.160
What we're really interested
in doing is just sending a

00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:24.190
likelihood ratio back to this
Viterbi decoder which it can

00:39:24.190 --> 00:39:26.820
use in making final decisions.

00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:30.160
To see how well that's going to
work, this is exactly the

00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:32.100
thing you want to look at.

00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:37.030
This is what's telling you, if
E b is large enough your

00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:40.450
decisions, if you had to make
them, would be very good.

00:39:40.450 --> 00:39:43.660
Therefore, if instead of making
decisions, you pass

00:39:43.660 --> 00:39:47.470
likelihood ratios on, those
likelihood ratios are going to

00:39:47.470 --> 00:39:49.880
have a lot of information
in them.

00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:54.010
Essentially, those likelihood
ratios tell you what those

00:39:54.010 --> 00:39:56.100
codewords are.

00:39:56.100 --> 00:40:01.650
OK, now, the effect of fading
is to change this E sub b

00:40:01.650 --> 00:40:04.510
because when we were talking
about this incoherent

00:40:04.510 --> 00:40:12.100
detection, we were looking at
the energy per bit after going

00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:13.350
through the channel.

00:40:15.990 --> 00:40:19.470
So, this is the error
probability for a particular

00:40:19.470 --> 00:40:21.940
received energy per bit.

00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:25.270
Sometimes when the channel is
badly faded, this number is

00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:27.070
very small.

00:40:27.070 --> 00:40:30.170
This bound is a lot bigger than
one but you don't care

00:40:30.170 --> 00:40:33.820
about it because the bound
is no good then.

00:40:37.010 --> 00:40:41.090
When the channel is good, this
number is large and this

00:40:41.090 --> 00:40:43.860
probability there is very small
and your likelihood

00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:47.390
ratios give you a lot
of information.

00:40:47.390 --> 00:40:51.110
If you had multitap diversity
instead of the single-tap

00:40:51.110 --> 00:40:53.390
here, if you have
a lot of taps.

00:40:53.390 --> 00:40:56.080
If you have a lot of taps you
can visualize this as getting

00:40:56.080 --> 00:41:00.230
independent readings
on the channel.

00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:02.630
Therefore, you can view it
as getting independent

00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:07.040
information about the bits that
were sent and this is

00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:09.910
what diversity is.

00:41:09.910 --> 00:41:12.670
I mean, the trouble with these
Rayleigh fading channels is

00:41:12.670 --> 00:41:15.190
when they're faded there's
nothing you can do.

00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:18.800
If you have multiple taps
instead of one tap, then in

00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:21.320
fact, you have diversity
between all of them.

00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:23.340
If any of them are good,
then you decode.

00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:23.660
Yes?

00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:28.752
AUDIENCE: You were saying
earlier that PAM is not ideal

00:41:28.752 --> 00:41:31.140
[INAUDIBLE].

00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:33.140
[INAUDIBLE]

00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:36.403
Why is the standard using 2PAM
instead of pulse position

00:41:36.403 --> 00:41:38.690
modulation?

00:41:38.690 --> 00:41:40.540
PROFESSOR: Well because it's
using these long codewords.

00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:47.880
Because back when we were
analyzing it, we were

00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:50.590
analyzing it using
two codewords.

00:41:50.590 --> 00:41:54.600
Those two codewords were
orthogonal to each other.

00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:59.990
We could have made them plus
one minus one and plus one

00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:03.420
minus one for the other one if
we had in fact known what the

00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:06.510
channel was ahead of time, OK.

00:42:14.010 --> 00:42:16.370
That brings up a good point
because you have to get to

00:42:16.370 --> 00:42:18.030
started somehow.

00:42:18.030 --> 00:42:20.590
I mean you have to know somehow,
what's going on at

00:42:20.590 --> 00:42:23.370
the channel at the point
where you start.

00:42:23.370 --> 00:42:24.730
I'm not going to talk
about that.

00:42:28.390 --> 00:42:32.740
If you have this multitap
diversity than E sub b is

00:42:32.740 --> 00:42:34.170
going to be better
than it would be.

00:42:34.170 --> 00:42:41.460
Otherwise, this says, if you can
make the bandwidth bigger,

00:42:41.460 --> 00:42:43.600
as you make the bandwidth
bigger, the bits

00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:45.670
are coming in faster.

00:42:45.670 --> 00:42:50.460
As the bits are coming in
faster, this bit time is the

00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:54.550
separation between the taps
and this digital model.

00:42:54.550 --> 00:42:56.890
So that as you make the
bandwidth bigger, you

00:42:56.890 --> 00:42:58.520
automatically get
more diversity.

00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:01.600
You get more taps in this
discrete model.

00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:04.110
Looking at it another way, you
have a certain frequency

00:43:04.110 --> 00:43:05.750
coherence in the channel.

00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:09.100
If you're sending a broad
bandwidth, you get lots of

00:43:09.100 --> 00:43:10.800
different frequencies.

00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:13.220
If you get lots of different
frequencies, there's a good

00:43:13.220 --> 00:43:16.540
chance that one of
them is good.

00:43:16.540 --> 00:43:20.370
OK, so we are going to get some
gain in diversity there.

00:43:20.370 --> 00:43:23.360
Typically we're going to get a
relatively large amount of

00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:26.610
energy if the thing works.

00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:33.550
Well, now we come to a question
that we've been

00:43:33.550 --> 00:43:37.140
carefully avoiding all term.

00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:45.310
It's sort of the question of,
if you make codewords

00:43:45.310 --> 00:43:49.690
orthogonal or if you make
codewords have nice structure

00:43:49.690 --> 00:43:53.430
at the input to a channel and
the channel has some strange

00:43:53.430 --> 00:43:58.930
behavior, what's going to be
the output of the channel?

00:43:58.930 --> 00:44:01.130
What we're doing here is
making our codewords

00:44:01.130 --> 00:44:04.840
orthogonal at the input of the
channel, we can't guarantee

00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:07.800
that they're still orthogonal
at the output.

00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:11.610
What we do know is that PN
sequences are almost

00:44:11.610 --> 00:44:13.770
orthogonal anyway.

00:44:13.770 --> 00:44:17.490
If you put PN sequence through
anything, they still look like

00:44:17.490 --> 00:44:19.170
PN sequences.

00:44:19.170 --> 00:44:22.880
In other words, if you think
of a PN sequence as an IID

00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:26.870
binary sequence, and you have
a very long IID binary

00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:31.360
sequence, and you corrupt it
in any way you want to, it

00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:35.420
still looks like an IID
binary sequence.

00:44:35.420 --> 00:44:38.620
So, the point is, if you can
make these orthogonal

00:44:38.620 --> 00:44:42.850
codewords look more like PN
sequences, you can make them

00:44:42.850 --> 00:44:46.070
behave better at the output of
the channel as well as the

00:44:46.070 --> 00:44:47.580
input to the channel.

00:44:47.580 --> 00:44:52.600
So you'll get something that
looks orthogonal whether the

00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:55.590
channel essentially looks like
a one tap channel or a

00:44:55.590 --> 00:44:58.520
multiple tap channel.

00:44:58.520 --> 00:45:01.770
OK, we also have bandwidth to
burn because we're only up to

00:45:01.770 --> 00:45:06.290
307 kilohertz.

00:45:06.290 --> 00:45:11.830
What they decided to do was to
take a PN sequence and run it

00:45:11.830 --> 00:45:15.020
at four times the speed
of this bit sequence.

00:45:15.020 --> 00:45:19.860
So we have bits coming in at
307,000 bits per second.

00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:23.770
We're going to have a PN
sequence which is changing

00:45:23.770 --> 00:45:28.190
four times for each bit time.

00:45:28.190 --> 00:45:31.180
So suddenly we're increasing the
speed of this whole system

00:45:31.180 --> 00:45:33.590
by a factor of four.

00:45:33.590 --> 00:45:38.950
For every one bit, we multiply
it by a sequence of four bits.

00:45:38.950 --> 00:45:43.780
So instead of getting a change
every one over 307,000

00:45:43.780 --> 00:45:51.310
seconds, you now get a change
every one over 1.2288

00:45:51.310 --> 00:45:53.390
millionths of a second.

00:45:53.390 --> 00:45:56.080
So, suddenly you're up to a
sequence which is right at the

00:45:56.080 --> 00:45:57.510
bandwidth you want.

00:45:57.510 --> 00:46:01.740
I mean we want it to get
up to 1.25 megahertz.

00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:06.210
Suddenly, we're up so close to
that it's going to be a real

00:46:06.210 --> 00:46:12.610
challenge to build a filter,
which will really make the

00:46:12.610 --> 00:46:20.390
output look like it's limited
to this 1.25 megahertz.

00:46:20.390 --> 00:46:24.020
So we need very tight
filters here.

00:46:24.020 --> 00:46:26.660
If you multiply this PN sequence
, you're using the

00:46:26.660 --> 00:46:31.040
same PN sequence on all of
the orthogonal codewords.

00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:34.420
If you think just a little bit
about it, if these orthogonal

00:46:34.420 --> 00:46:35.480
codewords --

00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:40.170
I'm I mean think of them still
as binary sequences --

00:46:40.170 --> 00:46:43.420
if each of them differ from each
other when in half the

00:46:43.420 --> 00:46:48.260
places, when you multiply both
of them by this PN sequence,

00:46:48.260 --> 00:46:50.280
they're still gonna differ
in half the places.

00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:54.930
You still got the
same affect out.

00:46:54.930 --> 00:46:57.920
They're still perfectly
orthogonal before going

00:46:57.920 --> 00:47:00.740
through a channel but now you
have a good chance that

00:47:00.740 --> 00:47:03.830
they're pretty close to
orthogonal after going through

00:47:03.830 --> 00:47:06.880
the channel.

00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:10.700
So, suddenly, we've got
it up to the bandwidth

00:47:10.700 --> 00:47:13.420
we want to be at.

00:47:13.420 --> 00:47:17.740
There's another reason
for the PN sequence.

00:47:17.740 --> 00:47:20.480
I mean, so far we've been
thinking in terms of, how do

00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:23.780
you build a cell phone
and a base station so

00:47:23.780 --> 00:47:25.710
they will work together?

00:47:25.710 --> 00:47:28.820
Actually, you want to build a
base station and thousands of

00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:31.400
cell phones so they'll
work together.

00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:34.660
So you want some way of making
different cell phones look

00:47:34.660 --> 00:47:37.620
different from each other.

00:47:37.620 --> 00:47:41.740
What they use this PN sequence
for is to make different cell

00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:44.750
phones look different.

00:47:44.750 --> 00:47:49.290
Each cell phone is going to
start out on this PN sequence

00:47:49.290 --> 00:47:50.440
at a different point.

00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:57.630
The PN sequence is going to be
generated by a 42 bit feedback

00:47:57.630 --> 00:47:58.900
shift register.

00:47:58.900 --> 00:48:01.500
If you don't know what a
feedback shift register is,

00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:02.470
don't worry about it.

00:48:02.470 --> 00:48:04.420
Most of you probably do.

00:48:04.420 --> 00:48:09.840
A 42 bit feedback shift
register, with the right kind

00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:14.050
of settings in it, is going to
generate a periodic sequence

00:48:14.050 --> 00:48:18.080
with a period of two to the
forty second minus one, which

00:48:18.080 --> 00:48:21.310
is about four times
10 to the twelfth.

00:48:21.310 --> 00:48:23.190
It doesn't repeat very often.

00:48:23.190 --> 00:48:26.890
I mean, this really
looks like an IID

00:48:26.890 --> 00:48:29.780
sequence and binary digits.

00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:34.740
It really goes through every non
zero 42 bit combination in

00:48:34.740 --> 00:48:35.930
this period here.

00:48:35.930 --> 00:48:38.310
It has very nice properties
to it.

00:48:38.310 --> 00:48:43.410
But the property we want for
this system is that in fact,

00:48:43.410 --> 00:48:47.400
when you give a cell phone a
particular setting in that

00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:54.110
shift register, it starts it off
generating a PN sequence

00:48:54.110 --> 00:48:57.350
which looks totally different
from that generated by any

00:48:57.350 --> 00:48:58.840
other cell phone.

00:48:58.840 --> 00:49:00.920
That's the only thing that makes
these different cell

00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:02.270
phones different.

00:49:02.270 --> 00:49:05.820
It's enough to make each one
of them look orthogonal to

00:49:05.820 --> 00:49:09.120
each of the others.

00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:13.830
OK, their basements sequences
and thus passband wave forms

00:49:13.830 --> 00:49:16.080
are now going to be essentially
orthogonal to

00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:17.350
those of other cell phones.

00:49:17.350 --> 00:49:22.420
In other words, at this point,
we're sort of going into

00:49:22.420 --> 00:49:23.840
fantasy world.

00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:27.400
I mean, we started out
generating 64 wave forms which

00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:30.110
were strictly orthogonal
to each other.

00:49:30.110 --> 00:49:32.690
Then we said we want these
wave forms to still be

00:49:32.690 --> 00:49:37.130
orthogonal after we go through
this unknown channel.

00:49:37.130 --> 00:49:39.920
We said, well we can do
this by making them

00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:42.890
look like PN sequences.

00:49:42.890 --> 00:49:46.410
But the other thing that PN
sequences do, is it all of the

00:49:46.410 --> 00:49:53.430
possible wave forms for one
cellphone will look orthogonal

00:49:53.430 --> 00:49:57.690
to the wave forms for all of
the other cell phones.

00:49:57.690 --> 00:50:01.760
So that in fact, what's
happening is, if you look at a

00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:04.640
base station, and the base
station is trying to receive

00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:09.260
information from each cell
phone, what it receives from

00:50:09.260 --> 00:50:12.710
one cell phone is going to be
essentially independent of

00:50:12.710 --> 00:50:17.140
what it receives from
the next cell phone.

00:50:17.140 --> 00:50:21.920
Now if we think of the base
station as trying to receive

00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:25.520
what's coming from one cell
phone, what's the interference

00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:29.280
from the other cell phone
going to look like?

00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:33.000
We're going to take thousands
and thousands of sequences,

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:37.880
which are now turned into wave
forms, which look like IID

00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:42.210
wave forms, IID binary wave
forms, and now we're adding

00:50:42.210 --> 00:50:45.540
together a large
number of them.

00:50:45.540 --> 00:50:48.500
They fill up the whole
spectrum uniformly.

00:50:48.500 --> 00:50:50.240
So they have a spectral
density --

00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:53.000
I mean it's a random process
-- and it has a spectral

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:55.230
density which is flat over this

00:50:55.230 --> 00:50:58.170
bandwidth of 1.25 megahertz.

00:50:58.170 --> 00:51:01.030
And you've added a lot of them
together, so it looks like

00:51:01.030 --> 00:51:02.780
white noise.

00:51:02.780 --> 00:51:08.180
So the effect of these other
cell phones is just like a

00:51:08.180 --> 00:51:12.860
small addition of white noise
as far as trying to detect

00:51:12.860 --> 00:51:15.360
what's going on at
one cell phone.

00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:19.370
Now, in fact you could be very
clever here because, as soon

00:51:19.370 --> 00:51:23.990
as a base station decodes one
cell phone, it can say, I know

00:51:23.990 --> 00:51:26.890
what that wave form was,
subtracts it off from the

00:51:26.890 --> 00:51:31.750
received wave form, and uses
that to help in decoding other

00:51:31.750 --> 00:51:32.950
wave forms.

00:51:32.950 --> 00:51:34.820
These standards do not
do anything as

00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:37.700
sophisticated as that.

00:51:37.700 --> 00:51:39.730
Lots of papers talk
about doing it.

00:51:39.730 --> 00:51:42.280
Information theorists
love this idea.

00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:51.970
I think it's one of these ideas
that sooner or later, ah

00:51:51.970 --> 00:51:53.340
going to become practical.

00:51:53.340 --> 00:51:55.120
As soon as it becomes
practical,

00:51:55.120 --> 00:51:56.720
everyone will use it.

00:51:56.720 --> 00:51:58.780
What does it take to
become practical?

00:51:58.780 --> 00:52:04.560
For someone to use it, because
we all know it'll work.

00:52:04.560 --> 00:52:07.030
It's just a matter of
actually doing it.

00:52:07.030 --> 00:52:10.750
But anyway, it's not done now.

00:52:10.750 --> 00:52:13.900
All of these interferes are just
going to look like white

00:52:13.900 --> 00:52:16.710
noise as far as this
one cellphone

00:52:16.710 --> 00:52:18.710
detection is concerned.

00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:25.780
Now, if we compare this IS95
system with all of the narrow

00:52:25.780 --> 00:52:29.410
band systems that people use, at
this point you can find the

00:52:29.410 --> 00:52:32.840
main difference between these
different systems.

00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:38.750
When you use a narrow band
system, things are a ranged so

00:52:38.750 --> 00:52:43.990
that only one cell phone is
talking to one base station on

00:52:43.990 --> 00:52:46.390
one of these narrow bands
of frequency.

00:52:46.390 --> 00:52:49.890
Namely the channels are very
narrow but because they're

00:52:49.890 --> 00:52:56.690
narrow if you have two cell
phones which are using that

00:52:56.690 --> 00:53:00.000
same bandwidth, they're just
going to interfere with each

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:00.980
other totally.

00:53:00.980 --> 00:53:03.000
You won't get through.

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:07.290
So each cell phone which is
using one base station has to

00:53:07.290 --> 00:53:12.130
be using a different
narrow bandwidth.

00:53:12.130 --> 00:53:16.530
Cell phones using different
adjoining base stations are

00:53:16.530 --> 00:53:21.390
also going to have to
use different bands.

00:53:21.390 --> 00:53:26.900
In fact, that's a terribly
complicated problem just

00:53:26.900 --> 00:53:30.160
because these base stations
are put in sort of, random

00:53:30.160 --> 00:53:34.410
locations and trying to program
things in such a way

00:53:34.410 --> 00:53:37.080
that you don't have two cell
phones which are using

00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:41.440
adjacent base stations using
the same frequency.

00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:42.690
It's a real nightmare.

00:53:45.470 --> 00:53:47.910
So, you're going to have cell
phones using the same base

00:53:47.910 --> 00:53:51.210
station, which are a little
bit separated, but still

00:53:51.210 --> 00:53:55.030
because of all sorts of
channeling effects and strange

00:53:55.030 --> 00:53:59.530
electromagnetic effects, base
stations still receive data

00:53:59.530 --> 00:54:03.030
from these far away
cell phones.

00:54:03.030 --> 00:54:05.960
They're also trying to receive
data from the cell phone

00:54:05.960 --> 00:54:07.670
that's using that frequency.

00:54:07.670 --> 00:54:10.060
So you got a lot of interference
in these narrow

00:54:10.060 --> 00:54:19.130
band systems; you got a lot of
interference from cell phones

00:54:19.130 --> 00:54:21.630
using different base stations.

00:54:21.630 --> 00:54:25.570
In the IS95 system, you get more
interference from cell

00:54:25.570 --> 00:54:28.680
phones that are using this
particular base station

00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:31.900
because they're all using
the same bandwidth.

00:54:31.900 --> 00:54:34.530
They all just look like white
noise to each other.

00:54:34.530 --> 00:54:36.410
So they do interfere with
each other, they

00:54:36.410 --> 00:54:38.390
raise the noise level.

00:54:38.390 --> 00:54:40.580
When you look at the
interference with cell phones

00:54:40.580 --> 00:54:44.870
using other base stations, it's
not catastrophic like it

00:54:44.870 --> 00:54:49.060
is with these narrow
band systems.

00:54:49.060 --> 00:54:53.700
So what you effectively wind
up with is that in the IS95

00:54:53.700 --> 00:54:57.610
system, you have more
interference within a base

00:54:57.610 --> 00:55:01.340
station but less interference
between base stations.

00:55:01.340 --> 00:55:04.700
In the narrow band systems you
have no interference within a

00:55:04.700 --> 00:55:08.170
base station but considerable
interference

00:55:08.170 --> 00:55:09.840
between base stations.

00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:11.080
Which is better?

00:55:11.080 --> 00:55:12.630
Nobody really knows.

00:55:15.470 --> 00:55:18.980
Well except for the fact that
almost all new systems are

00:55:18.980 --> 00:55:21.000
planning to use CDMA.

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:27.200
It seems that most people have
sort of agreed that you get

00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:30.850
less noise, overall, if
you're using if you're

00:55:30.850 --> 00:55:32.740
using a CDMA system.

00:55:42.010 --> 00:55:45.450
So that let's us sort of
summarize where we are with

00:55:45.450 --> 00:55:47.330
all of this.

00:55:47.330 --> 00:55:52.340
We started out with 28.8
kilobits per second.

00:55:52.340 --> 00:55:58.060
We then going into this Walsh
function, orthogonal wave form

00:55:58.060 --> 00:56:01.860
and coder, which comes
out with 307.2

00:56:01.860 --> 00:56:03.480
kilobits per second.

00:56:03.480 --> 00:56:09.650
We then multiplied by this long
PN sequence, 42 bits long

00:56:09.650 --> 00:56:13.560
with four bits coming in here
for each bit coming in here.

00:56:13.560 --> 00:56:17.690
Now we're implementing this and
anybody with any sense who

00:56:17.690 --> 00:56:23.110
was trying to implement PN
sequences with multipliers

00:56:23.110 --> 00:56:30.440
would just say, I don't want
to turn things into to PAM

00:56:30.440 --> 00:56:31.450
sequences yet.

00:56:31.450 --> 00:56:34.240
I want to keep them binary
and add them mod 2

00:56:34.240 --> 00:56:35.360
because that's easier.

00:56:35.360 --> 00:56:38.900
So all of this is still
mod 2 binary digits.

00:56:38.900 --> 00:56:40.950
This is mod 2 binary digits.

00:56:40.950 --> 00:56:43.490
This is mod 2 binary digits.

00:56:43.490 --> 00:56:47.470
The only thing we haven't talked
about yet is now they

00:56:47.470 --> 00:56:50.960
throw in two other
PN sequences.

00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:56.040
One on the real part of what's
going on here and one on the

00:56:56.040 --> 00:56:56.960
quadrature part.

00:56:56.960 --> 00:56:59.520
The thing they're doing is
taking this one sequence,

00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:03.780
splitting it into two parts;
adding a PN sequence here,

00:57:03.780 --> 00:57:08.820
adding a PN sequence here,
then doing the 2PAM, then

00:57:08.820 --> 00:57:12.550
filtering and sending this
stuff out on the cosign

00:57:12.550 --> 00:57:16.120
channel and the stuff out
on the sign channel.

00:57:16.120 --> 00:57:20.810
I've never had a very good sense
of why you need these

00:57:20.810 --> 00:57:22.900
two PN sequences here.

00:57:22.900 --> 00:57:27.270
I can like sort of explain it
to you in the following way.

00:57:27.270 --> 00:57:30.850
If you didn't have PN sequences
here, what you'd be

00:57:30.850 --> 00:57:36.440
doing here is simply sending
this same sequence twice.

00:57:36.440 --> 00:57:38.970
So you be sending it on the
cosign channel, you'd be

00:57:38.970 --> 00:57:41.470
sending it on the sign channel,
which would sort of

00:57:41.470 --> 00:57:44.560
be equivalent to sending
it at 45 degrees.

00:57:47.190 --> 00:57:49.730
Once you realize that, you say
well, I might as well leave

00:57:49.730 --> 00:57:53.100
this whole thing out and just
use the cosign channel and

00:57:53.100 --> 00:57:55.890
nothing else.

00:57:55.890 --> 00:57:58.580
If I'm just using the cosign
channel and nothing else it

00:57:58.580 --> 00:58:02.120
won't make much difference
because the cosign just refers

00:58:02.120 --> 00:58:05.470
to the phase at this
transmitter.

00:58:05.470 --> 00:58:09.090
I'm talking about many cell
phones whose transmitters are

00:58:09.090 --> 00:58:12.530
all at different places relative
to a base station.

00:58:12.530 --> 00:58:15.090
Therefore, they're all going to
be using different phases

00:58:15.090 --> 00:58:19.090
so they're all going to fill
up the signal space.

00:58:19.090 --> 00:58:24.280
The thing that, that doesn't
take into account is the fact

00:58:24.280 --> 00:58:26.730
that if we do that we're not
using all the degrees of

00:58:26.730 --> 00:58:28.350
freedom available to us.

00:58:28.350 --> 00:58:31.470
We're still just using the
number of degrees of freedom

00:58:31.470 --> 00:58:34.470
that we got here, which are
real degrees of freedom.

00:58:34.470 --> 00:58:37.320
When we do this and this,
we got twice as

00:58:37.320 --> 00:58:40.210
many degrees of freedom.

00:58:40.210 --> 00:58:42.690
The PN sequences that we're
looking at, which are the

00:58:42.690 --> 00:58:46.160
things that are orthogonal
to each other.

00:58:46.160 --> 00:58:50.820
We have twice as many bits in
a give interval of time when

00:58:50.820 --> 00:58:57.350
we have these two PN sequences
as we do when we only use this

00:58:57.350 --> 00:58:59.160
one PN sequence.

00:58:59.160 --> 00:59:04.340
So in fact, if we view PN as
IID binary digits, you get

00:59:04.340 --> 00:59:09.300
twice as many binary digits this
way as you got before.

00:59:09.300 --> 00:59:14.290
Therefore, everything
works better.

00:59:14.290 --> 00:59:17.570
You come much closer to being
orthogonal with higher

00:59:17.570 --> 00:59:20.490
probabilities.

00:59:20.490 --> 00:59:22.030
If you didn't understand
that's fine.

00:59:22.030 --> 00:59:24.500
It's not explained in
the notes either.

00:59:24.500 --> 00:59:29.350
It's not explained in
the IS95 standard.

00:59:29.350 --> 00:59:32.610
I think the explanation is
right but it needs some

00:59:32.610 --> 00:59:33.860
fleshing out.

00:59:36.970 --> 00:59:40.350
OK, here's another interesting
feature

00:59:40.350 --> 00:59:41.890
about this rake receiver.

00:59:44.650 --> 00:59:49.920
It doesn't use this digital
model of the channel that

00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:51.740
we've talked about.

00:59:51.740 --> 00:59:55.550
It in fact, uses the analogue
base band model.

00:59:55.550 --> 00:59:59.090
In other words, the base band
model of the channel is the

00:59:59.090 --> 01:00:04.200
channel is represented
by an analog filter.

01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:12.200
The analogue filter has impulses
or almost impulses at

01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:13.450
different delays.

01:00:15.310 --> 01:00:20.000
Now what you'd like to do in
this rake receiver here is

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:23.850
instead of having taps at these
sample times for the

01:00:23.850 --> 01:00:28.110
given bandwidth, they're going
to adjust the taps so the taps

01:00:28.110 --> 01:00:33.600
are right on top of these things
that look like impulses

01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:36.590
in all of these path returns.

01:00:36.590 --> 01:00:40.290
So the question is, what's the
difference between these two

01:00:40.290 --> 01:00:42.240
strategies?

01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:44.660
I mean, we sort of show that
the digital model was

01:00:44.660 --> 01:00:49.470
completely equivalent
to the analog model.

01:00:49.470 --> 01:00:56.590
Then I cheated you; I didn't
realize I cheated you until

01:00:56.590 --> 01:00:58.650
about nine o'clock
this morning.

01:00:58.650 --> 01:01:04.340
I cheated you in the following
way: I told you that if you

01:01:04.340 --> 01:01:07.580
model the channel in terms of
the discrete set of taps

01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:11.600
according to the sampling
therom, this was completely

01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:17.600
equivalent to trying to model it
-- as far as a band limited

01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:21.710
input was concerned -- in terms
of an analog filter.

01:01:21.710 --> 01:01:26.130
That's absolutely right if you
use an infinite number of taps

01:01:26.130 --> 01:01:28.260
for the channel.

01:01:28.260 --> 01:01:30.990
If you now say that the impulse
response of the

01:01:30.990 --> 01:01:36.730
channel is about one tap long
and then you say, how many

01:01:36.730 --> 01:01:40.050
tabs do I need to
represent it?

01:01:40.050 --> 01:01:43.460
It's an interesting question
because if the impulse

01:01:43.460 --> 01:01:48.810
response is one tap long and you
filter to look like a sign

01:01:48.810 --> 01:01:57.910
x over x, the impulse response
can look like this.

01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:08.530
So you have one tap here, one
tap here, which is zero, one

01:02:08.530 --> 01:02:11.840
tap here, one tap here,
which is zero.

01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:15.320
If you've gotten your spacing
off by half a cycle, what do

01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:17.020
you have then?

01:02:17.020 --> 01:02:20.140
You have a tap here.

01:02:20.140 --> 01:02:21.870
You have a tap here.

01:02:21.870 --> 01:02:23.740
You have a tap here.

01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:28.770
You have these taps which are
going down as one over time.

01:02:28.770 --> 01:02:32.470
So in fact, modeling this
kind of thing with one

01:02:32.470 --> 01:02:35.170
tap would be terrible.

01:02:35.170 --> 01:02:38.800
Now when you use the analog
filter and you actually put

01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:43.040
these taps of the rake receiver
at the places where

01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:49.230
you have actual physical
responses you do much better.

01:02:49.230 --> 01:02:53.160
You particularly do better if
the impulse response duration

01:02:53.160 --> 01:03:00.650
of the channel is the same order
of magnitude as 1 over

01:03:00.650 --> 01:03:04.090
the bandwidth of the source
that you're using.

01:03:04.090 --> 01:03:06.950
At that point this becomes
an important issue.

01:03:06.950 --> 01:03:11.170
That's exactly the situation
we have here because of the

01:03:11.170 --> 01:03:14.590
impulse response of
these channels.

01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:32.500
The sample time on this discrete
model it's about

01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:34.980
eight-tenths of a microsecond.

01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:37.840
If you think of how far light
can travel in eight-tenths of

01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:44.430
a microsecond, it's about the
same as the multipath spreads

01:03:44.430 --> 01:03:48.930
you would find outdoors
when you're in a

01:03:48.930 --> 01:03:50.530
relatively rural area.

01:03:50.530 --> 01:03:53.680
If you're in a city area,
multipath spreads are going to

01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:55.240
be even smaller.

01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:58.980
So if you want to a rake
receiver to work well you

01:03:58.980 --> 01:04:01.840
should really have a rake
receiver which is trying to

01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:05.940
zero in on the actual physical
response times.

01:04:05.940 --> 01:04:09.150
This is what this system does.

01:04:09.150 --> 01:04:10.750
They did it right and
I did it wrong.

01:04:17.380 --> 01:04:19.590
OK, final thing.

01:04:19.590 --> 01:04:24.350
I told you I wanted to talk
about why we did scrambling.

01:04:24.350 --> 01:04:30.910
This rake decoder, in other
words, this decision device,

01:04:30.910 --> 01:04:35.910
which every six bits tries to
make a decision on these 64

01:04:35.910 --> 01:04:40.250
different orthogonal
wave forms.

01:04:40.250 --> 01:04:43.330
You can just make hard decisions
which gives you six

01:04:43.330 --> 01:04:45.610
bits out each time.

01:04:45.610 --> 01:04:49.280
You can produce six bits out
also with some likelihood

01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:51.700
about how likely they
are to be right.

01:04:51.700 --> 01:04:54.530
So what you'd like is some
information which is

01:04:54.530 --> 01:04:57.430
essentially the logarithm of
the probability of being

01:04:57.430 --> 01:04:59.780
correct over the probability
of error.

01:04:59.780 --> 01:05:04.080
You can estimate that in
your rake receiver.

01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:06.900
You can estimate it by knowing
whether you're making a close

01:05:06.900 --> 01:05:12.030
call or whether there's one
orthogonal wave form which is

01:05:12.030 --> 01:05:15.090
far more likely than
all of the others.

01:05:15.090 --> 01:05:19.790
So if you're making a close
call, then you produce an

01:05:19.790 --> 01:05:22.770
output that says, I think
it's this output but

01:05:22.770 --> 01:05:25.410
I'm not very sure.

01:05:25.410 --> 01:05:29.290
This is what goes into
this viterbi decoder.

01:05:29.290 --> 01:05:34.720
The viterbi decoder, since it's
operating on these states

01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:37.380
-- in other words, it's
operating on what it

01:05:37.380 --> 01:05:42.130
visualizes is being the state
of the viterbi decoder --

01:05:42.130 --> 01:05:45.580
it can actually deal with these
log likelihood ratios as

01:05:45.580 --> 01:05:47.970
well as anything else.

01:05:47.970 --> 01:05:50.920
That's one of the reasons you
want to use a viterbi decoder

01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:55.410
because most coding devices
that people have invented

01:05:55.410 --> 01:05:58.000
don't work very well with
analog signals.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.930
This does work well with
analog signals.

01:06:00.930 --> 01:06:06.780
The problem is, anytime you
make a mistake on the 64

01:06:06.780 --> 01:06:11.620
orthogonal wave forms, you
have a six bit batch of

01:06:11.620 --> 01:06:16.030
digits, a six bit block, and
you're going to be wrong,

01:06:16.030 --> 01:06:17.280
typically in three of them.

01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:26.220
well, you're going to be wrong
in a random number of them.

01:06:26.220 --> 01:06:27.660
Half the time you're
going to be wrong.

01:06:33.570 --> 01:06:38.930
What this means is if you put
this data into a decoder, what

01:06:38.930 --> 01:06:42.090
you're going to find is that
every time there's an error in

01:06:42.090 --> 01:06:46.470
the in the rake receiver, you're
going to have a burst

01:06:46.470 --> 01:06:51.450
of errors, some random bunch
of errors over six bits.

01:06:51.450 --> 01:06:54.110
This is typically going to be in
the order of three bits an

01:06:54.110 --> 01:06:56.200
error all at once.

01:06:56.200 --> 01:06:59.340
If you look at the structure of
that decoder, anytime you

01:06:59.340 --> 01:07:03.580
got a large number of errors in
all at once, it's going to

01:07:03.580 --> 01:07:07.210
screw the thing up terribly.

01:07:07.210 --> 01:07:10.440
I'll give you one
example of that.

01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:13.300
You can take a much simpler
coding example.

01:07:13.300 --> 01:07:17.520
Suppose you transmit either
all zeros, seven zeros or

01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:20.200
seven ones.

01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:23.570
At the receiver there's a
certain probability that you

01:07:23.570 --> 01:07:27.970
make an error on each
one of these bits.

01:07:27.970 --> 01:07:31.380
You first make a decision on
each bit and then after that

01:07:31.380 --> 01:07:33.390
you make a decision on
the whole code word.

01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:40.250
If the bit errors are
independent of each other,

01:07:40.250 --> 01:07:43.470
then you make an error in the
overall detection of these

01:07:43.470 --> 01:07:48.800
code words only when you make
four errors out of seven.

01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:52.400
Or five errors out of seven
which is negligible.

01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:55.030
So you calculate, what's the
probability of making four

01:07:55.030 --> 01:07:57.420
errors out of seven here?

01:07:57.420 --> 01:07:59.670
Well it's the number of
combinations of seven things

01:07:59.670 --> 01:08:04.650
taken three at a time which is
35 times p fourth, p to the

01:08:04.650 --> 01:08:06.400
fourth power which is
the probability

01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:09.770
of making four errors.

01:08:09.770 --> 01:08:13.520
If those bits are perfectly
correlated mainly, if whenever

01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:17.460
you make one bit error you make
all seven bit errors,

01:08:17.460 --> 01:08:22.100
then the probability of error is
p If p is relatively small,

01:08:22.100 --> 01:08:27.720
p is always a lot bigger than
35 times p to the fourth.

01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:31.330
In other words, the lesson here
is that highly dependent

01:08:31.330 --> 01:08:37.070
errors cause trouble for
any kind of decoder.

01:08:40.060 --> 01:08:42.680
Now you see why you had the
scrambler in here, why you

01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:43.920
have the interleaver.

01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:47.530
You Have the interleaver to take
these highly correlated

01:08:47.530 --> 01:08:52.090
errors which are coming out of
the rake receiver where you

01:08:52.090 --> 01:08:56.160
make blocks of six errors all
tend to appear together.

01:08:56.160 --> 01:09:01.060
You're scrambling them out so
they're widely separated so

01:09:01.060 --> 01:09:06.800
that the viterbi decoder is
able to deal with them.

01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:10.390
That's the last piece
of the whole thing.

01:09:10.390 --> 01:09:13.000
I could talk a little bit about
how the viterbi decoder

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:17.630
works but I think you're
probably exhausted by now.

01:09:17.630 --> 01:09:20.430
I think I will stop
at this point.

01:09:20.430 --> 01:09:23.070
Than you all for your attention
all term and good

01:09:23.070 --> 01:09:24.680
luck on the final.
