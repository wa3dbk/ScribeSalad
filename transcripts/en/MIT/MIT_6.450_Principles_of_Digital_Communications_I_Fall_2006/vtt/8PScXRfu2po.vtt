00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:24.670
PROFESSOR: OK I want to review
a little bit what we said

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:29.550
about detection at the end of
last hour, last hour and a

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.620
half, because we were going
through it relatively quickly.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.570
Detection is a very
funny subject.

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.850
Particularly the way that we
do it here because we go

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.250
through a bunch of very,
very simple steps.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.620
Everything looks trivial--

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.920
I hope it looks trivial-- as
we go, at least after you

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.970
think about it for awhile, and
you work with it for awhile,

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.010
you will come back and look at
it and you will say, "yes, in

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.450
fact that is trivial." Nothing
when you look at it for the

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.170
first time is trivial.

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.460
And the kind of detection
problems that we're

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.460
interested in is--

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.280
to start out with-- we want to
look just at binary detection.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.490
We're sending a binary signal,
it's going to go through some

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.350
signal encoder, which is the
kind of channel encoder we've

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.270
been thinking about.

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:32.460
It's going to go through a
baseband modulator, a baseband

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.510
to passband modulator.

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.440
It's going to have white
Gaussian noise, or some kind

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.230
of noise, added to it.

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.090
It's going to come out
the other end.

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.900
We come back from passband
to baseband.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.610
We then go through a baseband
demodulator.

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.330
We then sample at that point.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.920
And, the point is, when you're
all done with all of that,

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:00.870
what you've done is you've
started out sending either

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:07.220
plus a or minus a as a one-
dimensional numerical signal.

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.640
And when you're all through,
there's some one- dimensional

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.320
number that comes out, v. And
on the basis of that one-

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.850
dimensional number, v, you're
supposed to guess whether the

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.250
output is zero or one.

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.640
Now, one of the things that
we're doing right now is we're

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.660
simplifying the problem in the
sense that we're not looking

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.060
at a sequence of inputs coming
in, and we're not looking at a

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.560
sequence of outputs
coming out.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.750
We're only looking at a single
input coming in.

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.190
In other words, you build this
piece of communication

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.680
equipment, you get it all tuned
up, you get it into

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:45.690
steady state.

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.910
You send one bit.

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.400
You receive something.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.300
You try to guess at the
receiver, what was sent.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.710
And at that point you tear the
whole thing down and you wait

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.470
a year until you've set
it up perfectly again.

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.480
You send another bit.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.250
And we're not going to worry at
all about what happens with

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.840
the sequence, we're only
going to worry about

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.660
this one shot problem.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:14.950
You sort of have some kind of
clue that if you send the

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.100
whole sequence of bits, in a
system like this, and you

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.950
don't have intersymbol
interference, and the noise is

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.000
white, so it's sort of
independent from time to time.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.210
You sort of have a clue that
you're going to get the same

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:32.330
answer whether you send the
sequence of data or whether

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.290
you just send a single bit.

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.730
And we're going to show later
that that, in fact, is true.

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.810
But for the time being we want
to understand what's going on,

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.610
and to understand what's going
on we take this simplest

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.350
possible case where there's
only one bit that's being

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:50.600
transmitted.

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.120
It's the question, "Are we going
to destroy ourselves in

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.750
the next five years or not?" And
this question is important

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.340
to most of us, and at the output
we find out, in fact,

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.530
whether we're going to destroy
ourselves or not.

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.600
So it's one bit, but it's
one important bit.

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.760
OK, why are we doing
things this way?

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.330
Want to tell you a little story
about the first time I

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:20.650
really talked to
Claude Shannon.

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:25.170
I was a young member of the
faculty at that time, and I

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:27.360
was working on a problem
which I thought was

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.460
really a neat problem.

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.830
It was interesting
theoretically.

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.550
It was important practically.

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.950
And I thought, "gee, I finally
have something I can go to

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.020
this great man and talk to him
about." So I screwed up my

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.440
courage for about two days.

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.340
Finally I saw his door open and
him sitting there, so I

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.640
went in and started to tell
him about this problem.

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:54.570
He's a very kind person and he
listened very patiently.

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.510
And after about 15 minutes
he said, "My god!

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.400
I'm just sort of lost
with all of this.

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.990
There's so much stuff going
on in this problem.

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.950
Can't we simplify it a little
bit by throwing out this kind

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:09.190
of practical constraint you've
put on it?" I said, "yeah, I

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:13.040
guess so." So we threw that
out and the we went on for

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.390
awhile later, and then he
said, "My god, I'm still

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:18.240
terribly confused about
this whole thing.

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.210
Why don't we simplify it
in some other way?"

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.170
And this went on for
about an hour.

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:26.050
As I say, he was a
very patient guy.

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.500
And at the end of an hour I was
getting really depressed.

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.920
Because here was this beautiful
problem that I

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:35.720
thought was going to make me
famous, give me tenure, do all

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.140
these neat things.

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.290
And here he'd reduced
the thing to a

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:41.750
totally trivial toy problem.

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:42.930
And we looked at it.

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.130
And we said, yes this is
a trivial toy problem.

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:46.500
This is the answer.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.840
The problem is solved.

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.590
But so what?

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:53.920
And then he suggested putting
some of those

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.590
constraints back in again.

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:59.370
And as we started putting the
constraints back in, one- by-

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:03.280
one, we saw that each time we
put a new constraint in--

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.160
since we understood the problem
and its simplest

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.830
form-- putting the constraint
in, it was still simple.

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:13.060
And by the time we built the
whole thing back up again, it

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:16.160
was clear what the answer was.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:22.410
OK, in other words, what theory
means is really solving

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:23.680
these toy problems.

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.670
And solving the toy
problems first.

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:29.110
And in terms of practice, some
people think the most

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:34.090
practical thing is
to be practical.

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:38.100
And the whole point of this
course, and this particular

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:42.890
subject of detection is a
wonderful example of this, the

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:47.080
most practical thing is
to be theoretical.

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:51.340
I mean, you need to add practice
to the theory, but

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:54.260
the way you do things is you
start with a theory-- which

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:57.000
means you start with the toy
problems, you build up from

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.630
those toy problems, and after
you build up for awhile,

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:03.900
understanding what the practical
problem is also--

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:05.620
you then understand
how to deal with

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:07.200
the practical problem.

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:10.100
And the practical engineer who
doesn't have any of that

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:12.970
fundamental knowledge about
how to deal with these

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:17.630
problems is always submerged
in a sea of complexity.

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:21.080
Always doing simulations of
something that he doesn't, he

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.090
or she doesn't understand.

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:25.970
Always trying to interpret
something from it, but with

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:29.440
just too many things going on
to have any idea of what it

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:30.610
really means.

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:34.600
Ok, so that's why we're making
this trivial assumption here.

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.480
We're only putting one bit in.

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.520
We're ignoring what
happens all the

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.090
way through the system.

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:43.590
We only get one number out.

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:46.880
We're going to assume that this
one number here is either

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:49.730
plus or minus a, plus
the Gaussian

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:51.840
random noise variable.

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:55.090
And we're not quite sure why
it's going to be plus or minus

00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:57.960
a, plus a Gaussian noise random
variable, but we're

00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:59.980
going to assume that
for the time being.

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:00.630
OK?

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:06.610
So the detector observes the
sample values of the random

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:11.750
variable for which this is the
sample value, and then guesses

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:15.680
what the value of this random
variable, h, which is what we

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:16.780
call the input now.

00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:21.310
Because we view it from the
standpoint of the detector--

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:24.080
the detector has two possible
hypotheses--

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:27.140
one is that a zero was
sent, and the other

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:28.960
that a one was sent.

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:33.690
And on the basis of this
observation, you take first

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:36.430
the hypothesis zero and you
say, "Is this a reasonable

00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:39.840
hypothesis?" Then you look at
the hypothesis one, say, "Is

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:46.480
this a reasonable hypothesis?"
And then you guess whether you

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:49.990
think zero was more likely or
one is more likely, given this

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:52.070
observation that you've had.

00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:56.700
So what they detector has,
at this point, is a full

00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:01.180
statistical characterization
of the entire problem.

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:03.090
Mainly you have a model
of the problem.

00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:06.340
You understand every probability
in the universe

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:09.340
that might have any
effect on this.

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:13.240
And what might have any
effect on this--

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:16.360
as far as the way we've
set up the problem--

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:20.060
is only the question of what
are the probabilities that

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:22.145
you're going to send
one or the other of

00:09:22.145 --> 00:09:25.540
these signals here?

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:28.100
And conditional on each
of these, what are the

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:30.780
probabilities of this
random variable

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:32.730
appearing at the output?

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:35.130
Because you have to base your
decision only on this.

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:37.040
So all of the probabilities
only give you

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:39.150
this one simple thing.

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:43.310
Hypothesis testing, decision
making, decoding, all mean the

00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:43.850
same thing.

00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:45.900
They mean exactly
the same thing.

00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:54.740
And they're just done
by different people.

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:58.140
OK, so what that says is we're
assuming the detector uses a

00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:01.050
known probability model.

00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:03.200
And in designing the detector,
you know what that

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:05.890
probability model is.

00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:09.050
It might not be the right
probability model, and one of

00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:13.410
the things that many people
interested in detection study

00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:17.920
is the question of when you
think the probability model is

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:21.620
one thing and it's actually
something else, how well does

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:22.880
the detection work?

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:25.690
It's a little like the
Lempel-Ziv algorithm that we

00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:31.040
studied earlier for doing
source coding.

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:34.090
Which is, how do you do source
coding when you don't know

00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:35.930
what the probabilities are?

00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:38.450
And we found the best way to
study that, of course, was to

00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:41.470
first find out how to do source
encoding when you did

00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:43.460
know what the probabilities
were.

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:46.150
So we're doing the
same thing here.

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:49.090
We assume the detector is
designed to maximize the

00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:51.820
probability of guessing
correctly.

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:54.240
In other words, it's trying
to minimize the

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:56.160
probability of error.

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:59.940
We call that a MAP detector--
maximum a posteriori

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:03.890
probability decoding.

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:06.830
You can try to do
other things.

00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:10.600
You can say that there's a cost
of one kind of error, and

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:13.420
there's another cost of
another kind of error.

00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:16.780
I mean, if you're doing medical
testing or something.

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:20.350
If you guess wrong in one way,
you tell the patient there's

00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:23.380
nothing wrong with them, the
patient goes out, drops dead

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:25.120
the next day.

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:27.430
And you don't care about that,
of course, but you care about

00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:30.730
the fact that the patient is
going to sue the hospital for

00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:32.600
100 million dollars and you're
going to lose your

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:34.880
job because of it.

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:37.860
So there's a big cost to
guessing wrong in that way.

00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:45.960
But for now, we're not going
to bother about the costs.

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:49.970
One of the things that you'll
see when we get all done is

00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:51.640
that putting in cost
doesn't make the

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:53.970
problem any harder, really.

00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:57.310
You really wind up with the
same kind of problem.

00:11:57.310 --> 00:11:59.660
OK, so h is the random
variable that will be

00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:02.250
detected, and v is the
random variable

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:03.590
that's going to be observed.

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:05.650
The experiment is performed.

00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:10.140
Some sample value of v is
observed, and some sample

00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:13.520
value of the hypothesis
has actually happened.

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:16.320
In other words, what has
happened is you prepared the

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:18.020
whole system.

00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:24.350
Then at the input end to the
whole system, the input to the

00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:28.610
channel, somebody has chosen
a one or a zero without the

00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:30.920
knowledge of the receiver.

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:34.140
That one or zero has been sent
through this whole system, the

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:38.330
receiver has observed some
output, v, so in fact we're

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:41.320
now dealing with the
sample values of

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:42.100
two different things.

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:45.510
The sample value of the input,
which is h, the sample value

00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:48.880
of the output, which is v, and
in terms of the sample value

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:52.440
of the output, we're trying to
guess what the sample value of

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:54.620
the input is.

00:12:54.620 --> 00:13:00.630
OK, an error then occurs if,
after the output chooses a

00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:06.030
particular hypothesis as its
guess, and that hypothesis,

00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:08.620
then, is a function of
what it receives.

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:12.410
In other words, after you
receive something, what the

00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:17.530
detector has to do is somehow
map what gets received, which

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:22.100
is some number, into
either zero or one.

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:24.250
It's like what a
Quantizer does.

00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:28.340
Mainly, it maps the whole
region into two

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:30.360
different sub- regions.

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:32.680
Some things are mapped into
zero, Some things

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:36.020
are mapped into one.

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:39.220
This H bar then becomes a random
variable, but is a

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:43.400
random variable that is a
function of what's received.

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:46.260
So we have one random variable,
H, which is what

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:47.620
actually happened.

00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:50.720
There's another random variable,
H hat, which is what

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:53.390
the detector guesses
will happen.

00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:58.030
This is an unusual random
variable, because it's not

00:13:58.030 --> 00:14:01.070
determined ahead of time.

00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:04.170
It's determined only in terms
of what you decide your

00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:06.020
detection rule is going to be.

00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:09.190
This is a random variable that
you have some control over.

00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:10.940
These other random variables
you have no

00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:14.540
control over at all.

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:17.290
So that's the random variable
we're going to choose.

00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:20.330
And, in fact, what we're going
to do is we're going to say

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:24.690
what we want to do is this MAP
decoding, maximum a posteriori

00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:27.710
probability decoding, where
we're trying to minimize the

00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:29.710
probability of screwing up.

00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:35.470
And we don't care whether we
make an error of one kind or

00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:38.590
make an error of
the other kind.

00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:44.840
OK, is that formulation of the
problem crystal clear?

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:48.940
Anybody have any questions
about it?

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:54.730
I mean, the easiest way to get
screwed up with detection is

00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:58.140
at a certain point to be going
through, studying a detection

00:14:58.140 --> 00:15:00.700
problem, and then you
suddenly realize you

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:03.180
don't understand what--

00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:06.590
you don't understand what the
whole problem is about.

00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:12.650
OK, let's assume we do know
what the problem is, then.

00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:15.760
In principle it's simple.

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:19.190
Given a particular observed
value, what we're going to do

00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:22.240
is we're going to calculate
the-- what we call the a

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:25.850
posteriori probability, the
probability given that

00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:29.010
particular sample value
of the observation--

00:15:29.010 --> 00:15:32.120
we're going to calculate the
probability that what went

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:35.340
into the system is a zero
and what went into

00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:38.790
the system is a one.

00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:39.390
OK?

00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:44.930
This is the probability that
j is the sample value of H,

00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:50.040
conditional on what
we observed.

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:54.780
OK, if you can calculate this
quantity, it tells you if I

00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:56.030
decide that--

00:15:58.310 --> 00:16:02.870
if I guess that H is equal to
j-- this in fact tells me that

00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:06.950
this is the probability
that guess is correct.

00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:10.180
And if this is the probability
that guess is correct, and I

00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:12.570
want to maximize my probability
of guessing

00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:15.350
correctly, what do I do?

00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:22.500
Well, what I do is my MAP
rule is arg max of this

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:23.820
probability.

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:30.830
And "arg max" means instead
of trying to maximize this

00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:33.670
instead of trying to maximize
this quantity over something,

00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:37.870
what we're doing is trying to
find the value of j, which

00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:39.050
maximizes this.

00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:42.870
In other words, we calculate
this for each value of j, and

00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:46.330
then we picked the j for which
this quantity is largest.

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:49.890
In other words, we maximize this
but we're not interested

00:16:49.890 --> 00:16:52.860
in the maximum value of
it at this point.

00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:55.420
We're interested in it later
because that's the probability

00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:56.820
that we're choosing correctly.

00:16:56.820 --> 00:17:01.100
What we're interested in, for
now, is what is the hypothesis

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:02.820
that we're going to guess.

00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:03.480
OK?

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:08.570
So this probability of being
correct is going to the this

00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:11.730
probability for this
maximal j.

00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:16.125
And when we average over v we
get the overall probability of

00:17:16.125 --> 00:17:17.690
being correct.

00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:21.840
There's a theorem which is
stated in the notes, which is

00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:25.120
one of the more trivial theorems
you can think of,

00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:28.240
which says that if you do the
best thing for every sample

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:32.780
point you, in fact, have done
the best thing on average.

00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:35.050
I think that's pretty clear.

00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:39.605
If you, well I mean you can read
it if you want to form a

00:17:39.605 --> 00:17:44.650
proof, but if you do the best
thing all the time, then it's

00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:48.150
the overall best thing.

00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:57.570
OK, so that's the general
idea of detection.

00:17:57.570 --> 00:18:01.590
And in doing this we have to
be able to calculate these

00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:04.820
probabilities, so that's
the only constraint.

00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:07.940
These are probabilities, which
means that this set of

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:12.080
hypothesis is discrete.

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:16.460
If you have an uncountable
infinite number of hypotheses,

00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:19.070
at that point you're dealing
with an estimation problem.

00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:22.790
Because you don't have any
chance in hell of getting the

00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:25.700
right answer, exactly
the right answer.

00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:28.990
And therefore you have to
have some criterion for

00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:30.040
how close you are.

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:32.280
And that's what's important
in estimation.

00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:36.090
And here what's important is
really, do we guess right or

00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:37.300
don't we guess right.

00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:38.850
And we don't, we don't care.

00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:41.130
There aren't any near
misses here.

00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:45.330
You either get it on the
nose or you don't.

00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:47.820
OK, so we want to study
binary detection now

00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:48.690
to start off with.

00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:51.420
We want to trivialize the
problem because even that

00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:53.980
problem we just stated
is too hard.

00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:56.140
So we're going to trivialize
it in two ways.

00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:58.960
We're going to assume that there
are only two hypotheses.

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:01.670
That it's a binary detection
problem.

00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:05.370
And we're also going to assume
that it's Gaussian noise.

00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:10.380
And that will make it sort of
transparent what's happening.

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:13.250
So H takes the values
zero or one.

00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:15.880
And we'll call the probabilities
with which it

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:18.610
takes those values
P zero and P one.

00:19:18.610 --> 00:19:20.790
These are called a priori
probabilities.

00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:23.610
In other words, these are the
probabilities that the

00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:27.780
hypothesis takes to value zero
or one before seeing any

00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:29.680
observation.

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:33.070
And the probabilities after you
see the observation are

00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:35.940
called a posteriori
probabilities.

00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:38.870
In other words, probabilities
after the observation and the

00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:41.420
probabilities before
the observation.

00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:45.170
Up until about 1950
statisticians used to argue

00:19:45.170 --> 00:19:50.150
terribly about whether it was
valid to assume a priori

00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:52.600
probabilities.

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:56.150
And as you can see by thinking
about it a little bit, the

00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:59.630
problem they were facing was
they couldn't separate the

00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:02.680
problem of choosing a
mathematical model and

00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:07.730
analyzing it from the problem
of figuring out whether the

00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:10.330
model was valid or not.

00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:15.090
And at that point people
studying in that area had not

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:18.100
gotten to the point where they
could say, "Well, maybe I

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:21.660
ought to analyze the problem for
different models, and then

00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:24.630
after I understand what happens
for different models I

00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:27.470
then ought to go back because
I'll know what's important to

00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:33.140
find out in the real problem."
But up until that time, there

00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:36.200
was just fighting
among everyone.

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:39.310
Bayes was the person who decided
you really ought to

00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:41.600
assume that there's a
model to start with.

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:44.040
And he developed most
of detection

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:46.810
theory at an early time.

00:20:46.810 --> 00:20:50.070
And people used to think that
Bayes was a terrible fraud.

00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:53.530
Because in fact he was using
models of the problem rather

00:20:53.530 --> 00:20:56.710
than nothing.

00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:59.430
But anyway, that's
where we were.

00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:06.910
We're also going to assume that,
after we get all through

00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:09.230
with modulation and
demodulation, and we really

00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:11.740
want to look at a general
problem here.

00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:16.950
There's one discrete random
variable, H, one analog random

00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:20.800
variable, which has a
probability density, v, what

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:25.200
we want to assume is that
there's a probability density

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:29.800
that we know, which is the
probability density of the

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:34.050
observation conditional
on the hypothesis.

00:21:34.050 --> 00:21:37.860
We're assuming that we know
this, and we know this--

00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:41.160
we call these things
likelihoods--

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:46.430
and in most communication
problems anyway, it's far

00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:49.650
easier to get your hand on these
likelihoods than it is

00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:53.260
to get your hand the a
posteriori probabilities,

00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:55.510
which you're really
interested in.

00:21:55.510 --> 00:22:01.390
So we find these likelihoods,
we can find the marginal

00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:05.070
density of the observation.

00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:10.720
Which is just the
weighted sum.

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:13.790
The probability that the
hypothesis is zero times a

00:22:13.790 --> 00:22:18.200
conditional probability of the
observation and so forth.

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:24.570
So we're going to assume that
those densities exist.

00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:26.150
We're going to assume
that we know them.

00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:35.840
And then with a great feat of
probability theory, we say the

00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:44.290
a posteriori probability is
equal to the a priori

00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:50.570
probability times the likelihood
divided by the

00:22:50.570 --> 00:22:53.820
marginal probability of v. OK?

00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:55.900
What was the first thing you
learn in probability when you

00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:58.340
started studying random
variables?

00:22:58.340 --> 00:23:02.680
It was probably this formula,
which says when you have a

00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:06.970
joint density of two random
variables you can

00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:08.370
write it in two ways.

00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:11.920
You can either write, "density
of one times density of two

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:16.420
conditional and one is equal
to the density of two times

00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:20.510
density of one conditional in
two." And then you think about

00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:23.900
it a little bit and you say,
"A ha!" It doesn't matter

00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:26.890
whether the first one is the
density or whether it's the

00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:27.720
probability.

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:29.640
You can deal with it
in the same way.

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:32.390
And you get this formula,
which I hope is

00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:36.340
not unusual to you.

00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:40.310
OK, so our MAP decision rule
then, our MAP decision rule,

00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:45.720
remember, is to pick the more,
is to find the a posteriori

00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:48.860
probability which is
most probable.

00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:52.540
Because that is the probability
of being correct.

00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:56.530
So, in fact, if this probability
is bigger than

00:23:56.530 --> 00:24:01.260
this probability, this is the a
posteriori probability that

00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:03.200
H is equal to zero.

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:06.810
This is the a posteriori
probability that

00:24:06.810 --> 00:24:08.290
H is equal to one.

00:24:08.290 --> 00:24:11.220
So we're just going to compare
those two and pick the larger.

00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:18.420
And if this one is larger than
this one, we pick our choice

00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:19.740
equal zero.

00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:22.850
And if it's smaller, we pick
our choice equal to one.

00:24:22.850 --> 00:24:27.240
So this is what MAP
detection is.

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:30.670
Why did I make this greater
than or equal

00:24:30.670 --> 00:24:33.000
and this less than?

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.320
Well, if we have densities,
it doesn't often make any

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:37.730
difference.

00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:40.710
Strangely enough, it does
sometimes make a difference.

00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:43.280
Because sometimes you can have
a density, and the densities

00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:47.890
are the same for both of
these likelihoods.

00:24:47.890 --> 00:24:50.870
And you can find situations
where it's important.

00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:55.500
But when the two probabilities
are the same, the probability

00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:58.980
of being correct is the same in
both cases, so it doesn't

00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:01.750
make any difference what
you do when you

00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:04.250
have a quality here.

00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:06.580
And therefore we've just
made a decision.

00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:09.610
We've said, OK, what we're going
to do is whenever this

00:25:09.610 --> 00:25:13.950
is equal to this, we're
going to choose zero.

00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:18.020
If you prefer choosing
one, be my guest.

00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:20.390
All of your MAP error
probabilities will

00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:21.660
be exactly the same.

00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:23.580
Nothing will change.

00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:27.640
It just is easier to do the
same thing all the time.

00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:29.700
OK, well then we look at this
formula, and we say, "Well, I

00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:33.990
can simplify this a little
bit." If I take this

00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:39.700
likelihood and move it over to
this side, and if I take this

00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:43.010
marginal density and move it
over to this side, and if I

00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:45.970
take p zero and move it over
to this side, then the

00:25:45.970 --> 00:25:48.270
marginal densities cancel out.

00:25:48.270 --> 00:25:50.430
They had nothing to do
with the problem.

00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:54.080
And I wind up with a ratio
of the likelihoods.

00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:55.860
And what do you think
the ratio of the

00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:57.460
likelihoods is called?

00:25:57.460 --> 00:25:59.415
Somebody got the smart
idea of calling that

00:25:59.415 --> 00:26:02.930
a likelihood ratio.

00:26:02.930 --> 00:26:05.810
Somehow the people in statistics
were much better at

00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:09.640
generating notation than the
people in communication theory

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:12.360
who have done just an abominable
job of choosing

00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:14.660
notation for things.

00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:17.500
But anyway, they call this
a likelihood ratio.

00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:21.230
And the rule then becomes: if
the likelihood ratio is

00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:24.180
greater than or equal to
the ratio of p1 to

00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:26.710
p0, we choose zero.

00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:29.030
And if it's less,
we choose one.

00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:32.220
And we call this ratio
the threshold.

00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:38.240
So in fact what this says is
binary MAP tests are always

00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:39.840
threshold tests.

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:44.610
And by a threshold test I mean
finds the likelihood ratio,

00:26:44.610 --> 00:26:47.520
compare the likelihood ratio
with the threshold-- the

00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:51.010
threshold in fact is this
ratio of a priori

00:26:51.010 --> 00:26:53.120
probabilities--

00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:55.520
and at that point you
have actually

00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:57.980
achieved the MAP test.

00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:02.850
In other words, you have done
something which actually, for

00:27:02.850 --> 00:27:06.950
real, minimizes the probability
of error.

00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:10.610
Maximizes the probability
of being correct.

00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:15.730
Well because of that, this thing
here, this likelihood

00:27:15.730 --> 00:27:19.820
ratio, is called a sufficient
statistic.

00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:22.830
And it's called a sufficient
statistic because you can do

00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:27.100
math decoding just by
knowing this number.

00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:27.420
OK?

00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:30.920
In other words, it says you can
you can calculate these

00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:33.770
likelihoods.

00:27:33.770 --> 00:27:36.410
You can find the ratio of
them-- which is this

00:27:36.410 --> 00:27:40.120
likelihood ratio-- and after you
know the likelihood ratio,

00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:42.810
you don't have to worry about
these likelihoods anymore.

00:27:42.810 --> 00:27:47.030
This is the only thing relevant
to the problem.

00:27:47.030 --> 00:27:50.420
Now this doesn't seem to be a
huge saving, because here

00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:53.270
we're dealing with two real
numbers-- well here we've

00:27:53.270 --> 00:27:55.820
reduced it to one real number--
which is something.

00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:59.140
When we start dealing with
vectors, when we start dealing

00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:02.830
with wave forms, this is
really a big thing.

00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:05.580
Because what you're
doing is reducing

00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:08.270
the vectors to numbers.

00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:11.540
And when you reduce accountibly
infinite

00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:13.960
dimensional vector to a number,

00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:16.930
that's a big advantage.

00:28:16.930 --> 00:28:19.870
It also, in terms of the
communication problems we're

00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:24.270
facing, breaks up a detector
into two pieces in an

00:28:24.270 --> 00:28:25.900
interesting way.

00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:28.400
Mainly it says there are things
you do with the wave

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:33.400
form in order to calculate what
this likelihood ratio is,

00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:36.490
and then after you find the
likelihood ratio you just

00:28:36.490 --> 00:28:39.150
forget about what the wave
form was and you

00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:40.630
deal only with that.

00:28:40.630 --> 00:28:43.390
What we're going to find out
is in this problem we were

00:28:43.390 --> 00:28:44.640
looking at here--

00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:49.390
we're going to find out
later when we look

00:28:49.390 --> 00:28:52.060
at the vector problem--

00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:59.010
in fact this thing here is in
fact the likelihood ratio if

00:28:59.010 --> 00:29:02.560
you make an observation out
at this point here.

00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:06.090
In other words, right at the
front end of the receiver,

00:29:06.090 --> 00:29:07.950
that's where you have all
the information you

00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:10.620
can possibly have.

00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:16.680
If you calculate likelihood
ratios at that point what

00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:20.640
you're going to do is to find
the likelihood ratio you're

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:24.530
going to go through all this
stuff right here and wind up

00:29:24.530 --> 00:29:28.490
with that which is work which
is proportional to the

00:29:28.490 --> 00:29:30.760
likelihood ratio right here.

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:34.140
OK, so one of the things we're
doing right now is we're not

00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:35.360
looking at that problem.

00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:38.070
We're only looking at the
simpler problem, assuming a

00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:40.210
one dimensional problem.

00:29:40.210 --> 00:29:42.990
But the reason we're looking
at it is that later we're

00:29:42.990 --> 00:29:45.970
going to show that this is, in
fact, the solution to the more

00:29:45.970 --> 00:29:48.730
general problem.

00:29:48.730 --> 00:29:53.040
Which was Shannon's idea
in the first place.

00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:56.630
Of, how do you solve the trivial
problem first and then

00:29:56.630 --> 00:30:02.520
see what the complicated
problem is.

00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:10.340
OK, so that's what we're trying
to do, summarized here

00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:14.870
for any binary detection problem
where the observation

00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:18.520
has a sample value of
a random something.

00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:21.180
Namely, a random vector, a
random process, a random

00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:24.730
variable, a complex variable,
a complex anything.

00:30:24.730 --> 00:30:27.770
Anything whatsoever, so long
as you can assign a

00:30:27.770 --> 00:30:30.950
probability density to it.

00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:34.540
You calculate the likelihood
ratio, which is this ratio

00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:38.250
here, so long as you have then
cities even talk about.

00:30:38.250 --> 00:30:42.340
The MAP rule is to compare this
likelihood ratio with the

00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:45.460
threshold data-- which is just
the ratio of the a priori

00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:47.980
probabilities--

00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:49.660
if this is greater
than or equal to

00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:51.780
that, you choose zero.

00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:54.270
Otherwise you choose one.

00:30:54.270 --> 00:30:58.000
The MAP rule, as I said before,
partitions this

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.940
observation space
into two pieces.

00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:05.670
Into two segments.

00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:09.320
And one of those pieces
gets mapped into zero.

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:11.850
One of the pieces gets
mapped into one.

00:31:11.850 --> 00:31:15.600
It's exactly like a
binary quanitizer.

00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:19.440
Except the rule you use to
choose the the quantization

00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:20.440
regions is different.

00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:25.430
But a quanitizer maps a space
into a finite set of regions.

00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:29.200
And this detection rule does
exactly the same thing.

00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:32.270
And since the beginning of
information theory people have

00:31:32.270 --> 00:31:36.750
been puzzling over how to make
use of the correspondence

00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:41.020
between quanitization on one
hand and detection on the

00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:42.410
other hand.

00:31:42.410 --> 00:31:44.300
And there are some
correspondences but they

00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:47.830
aren't all that good
most of the time.

00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:52.640
OK, so you get an error when
the actual hypothesis that

00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:57.290
occurred, namely the bit that
got sent was i and if the

00:31:57.290 --> 00:32:01.630
observation landed in
the other subset.

00:32:01.630 --> 00:32:03.960
We know that the MAP rule
minimizes the error

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:05.130
probability.

00:32:05.130 --> 00:32:08.490
So you have a rule which you
can use for all binary

00:32:08.490 --> 00:32:12.390
detection problems so long
as you have the density.

00:32:12.390 --> 00:32:15.010
And if you don't have a density
you can generalize it

00:32:15.010 --> 00:32:18.560
without too much trouble.

00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:24.330
OK, so we want to look at the
problem in Gaussian noise.

00:32:24.330 --> 00:32:27.530
In particular we want to
look at it for 2PAM.

00:32:27.530 --> 00:32:32.720
In other words for a standard
PAM system, where zero gets

00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:37.670
mapped into plus a and one
gets mapped into minus a.

00:32:37.670 --> 00:32:40.850
This is often called antipodal
signaling because you're

00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:43.420
sending a plus something
and a minus something.

00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:46.600
They are at opposite ends
of the spectrum.

00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:49.760
You push them as far away as you
can, because as you push

00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:51.560
them further and further
away it requires

00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:52.930
more and more energy.

00:32:52.930 --> 00:32:54.780
So you use the energy
you have.

00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:57.880
You get them as far apart as you
can, and you hope that's

00:32:57.880 --> 00:32:58.940
going to help you.

00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:01.720
And we'll see that
it does help you.

00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:07.110
OK, so what you receive then,
we'll assume, is either plus

00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:08.020
or minus a--

00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:11.560
depending on which hypothesis
occured--

00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:14.750
plus a Gaussian random
variable.

00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:19.040
And here's where the notation
of communication theorists

00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:22.030
rears its ugly head.

00:33:22.030 --> 00:33:27.450
We call the variance of this
random variable n 0 over 2.

00:33:27.450 --> 00:33:31.900
I would prefer to call
it sigma squared but

00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:34.470
unfortunately you can't
fight city hall on

00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:36.410
something like this.

00:33:36.410 --> 00:33:40.510
And everybody talks about
n 0 and n 0 over 2.

00:33:40.510 --> 00:33:42.670
And you got to get used to it.

00:33:42.670 --> 00:33:45.260
So here's where we're starting
to get used to it.

00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:50.510
So that's the variance of this
noise random variable.

00:33:50.510 --> 00:33:54.460
OK, we're only going to send one
binary digit, H, so this

00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:57.850
is the only, this is the sole
problem we have to deal with.

00:33:57.850 --> 00:34:00.750
We've made a binary choice.

00:34:00.750 --> 00:34:04.110
Added one Gaussian random
variable to it.

00:34:04.110 --> 00:34:07.970
You observe the sum,
and you guess.

00:34:07.970 --> 00:34:12.330
So what are these likelihoods
in this case?

00:34:12.330 --> 00:34:16.130
Well, the likelihood if H is
equal zero, in other words if

00:34:16.130 --> 00:34:20.270
you're sending a plus a, the
likelihood is just a Gaussian

00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:24.350
density shifted over by a.

00:34:24.350 --> 00:34:27.620
And if you're sending, on
the other hand, a one--

00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:30.600
which means you're sending minus
a-- you have a Gaussian

00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:33.420
density shifted over
the other way.

00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:36.200
Let me show you a
picture of that.

00:34:40.530 --> 00:34:44.080
We'll come back to analyze more
things about the picture

00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:46.080
in a little bit, so don't
worry about most of the

00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:47.330
picture at this point.

00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:55.030
OK, this is the likelihood
probability density of the

00:34:55.030 --> 00:34:58.410
output given that
you sent a zero.

00:34:58.410 --> 00:35:00.380
Mainly that you sent plus a.

00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:02.940
So we have a Gaussian density--
this bell shaped

00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:05.620
curve-- centered
around plus a.

00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:09.750
If you sent a one, you're
sending minus a-- one gets

00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:13.230
mapped into minus a-- and you
have the same bell shaped

00:35:13.230 --> 00:35:16.560
curve centered around minus a.

00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:21.560
If you receive any particular
value of v, mainly suppose you

00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:25.220
receive the value of v here,
you calculate these two

00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:26.160
likelihoods.

00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:27.490
One of them is this.

00:35:27.490 --> 00:35:29.850
One of them is that.

00:35:29.850 --> 00:35:33.200
You compare them, the ratio with
the threshold, and you

00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:35.860
make your choice.

00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:39.910
OK, so let's go back to do it.

00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:42.730
To do the arithmetic.

00:35:42.730 --> 00:35:45.080
Here are the two likelihoods.

00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:47.860
You take the ratio of
these two things.

00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:51.180
When you take the ratio
of them, what happens?

00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:52.560
And this sort of always
happens in

00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:54.980
these Gaussian problems.

00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:57.320
These terms cancel out.

00:35:57.320 --> 00:35:58.330
Well it always happens in these

00:35:58.330 --> 00:36:00.150
additive Gaussian problems.

00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:02.810
These terms cancel out.

00:36:02.810 --> 00:36:06.150
You take a ratio of
two exponents.

00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:08.520
You just get the difference.

00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:12.600
So the likelihood ratio--
this divided by this--

00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:18.140
is then e to the minus v minus
a squared over n0.

00:36:18.140 --> 00:36:21.550
and v plus a squared over n0.

00:36:21.550 --> 00:36:21.900
OK?

00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:26.940
Because normally the Gaussian
density is something divided

00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:30.830
by two sigma squared, and sigma
squared here is n0 over

00:36:30.830 --> 00:36:32.580
2, so the 2's cancel out.

00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:35.560
One nice thing about the
notation anyway, you get rid

00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:37.260
of one factor of two in it.

00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:39.760
Well so you have this
minus this.

00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:43.190
When you take the difference
of these two things the v

00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:46.480
squareds cancel out.

00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:50.130
Because one of these things is
in the numerator, the other

00:36:50.130 --> 00:36:51.970
one was in the denominator.

00:36:51.970 --> 00:36:55.200
So you have this term
comes through as is.

00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:56.640
This is--

00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:58.830
you're dividing by this--

00:36:58.830 --> 00:37:01.800
so when you multiply this
turns into a plus sign.

00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:05.930
So the v squared here cancels
out with the v squared here.

00:37:05.930 --> 00:37:09.680
The a squared here cancels out
with the a squared here.

00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:12.810
And it's only the inner product
term that survives

00:37:12.810 --> 00:37:14.490
this whole thing.

00:37:14.490 --> 00:37:16.750
And here you have plus 2va.

00:37:16.750 --> 00:37:18.810
Here you have plus 2va.

00:37:18.810 --> 00:37:24.920
So you wind up with e to
the 4av divided by n0.

00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:28.060
Which is very nice, because
what it says is this

00:37:28.060 --> 00:37:31.140
likelihood, which is what
determines everything in the

00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:35.210
world, is just a scalar in
multiple of the observation.

00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:40.870
And that that's going to
simplify things a fair amount.

00:37:40.870 --> 00:37:43.170
It's why that picture comes
out as simply is it does.

00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:52.760
OK, so to do a little more
of the arithmetic.

00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:57.220
This is the likelihood here,
e to the 4av over n0.

00:37:57.220 --> 00:38:02.340
So our rule is you compare
this likelihood to the

00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:05.690
threshold-- which is p1 over
p0, which we call eta--

00:38:05.690 --> 00:38:09.590
and you look at that for awhile
and you say, "Gee, this

00:38:09.590 --> 00:38:12.500
is going to be much easier
to deal with.

00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:15.630
Instead of looking at the
likelihood ratio, I look at

00:38:15.630 --> 00:38:18.530
the log likelihood ratio."

00:38:18.530 --> 00:38:21.950
And people who deal with
Gaussian problems a lot, you

00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:25.220
never hear them talk about
likelihood ratios, you always

00:38:25.220 --> 00:38:28.890
hear them talk about log
likelihood ratios.

00:38:28.890 --> 00:38:33.200
And you can find one from the
other, so either one is

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:34.110
equally good.

00:38:34.110 --> 00:38:36.830
In other words, the log
likelihood ratio is a

00:38:36.830 --> 00:38:40.110
sufficient statistic, because
you can calculate the

00:38:40.110 --> 00:38:43.790
likelihood ratio from it.

00:38:43.790 --> 00:38:46.040
So this is a sufficient
statistic.

00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:49.110
It's equal to 4av over n0.

00:38:49.110 --> 00:38:52.200
And when this is greater than
or equal the log of the

00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:54.410
threshold, you go this way.

00:38:54.410 --> 00:38:56.960
When it's less than,
you go this way.

00:38:56.960 --> 00:39:05.170
So when you then multiply by n0
over 4a, your decision rule

00:39:05.170 --> 00:39:07.330
is you just look at
the observation.

00:39:07.330 --> 00:39:13.710
You compare it with n0 times
log of eta divided by 4a.

00:39:13.710 --> 00:39:18.330
And at this point we can go back
to this picture and sort

00:39:18.330 --> 00:39:22.770
of sort out what all
of it means.

00:39:22.770 --> 00:39:26.800
Because this point here
is now the threshold.

00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:29.640
It's n0 times log of
eta divided 4eta.

00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:34.230
By 4a.

00:39:34.230 --> 00:39:37.090
That's what we said the
threshold had to be.

00:39:37.090 --> 00:39:41.090
So we have these two Gaussian
curves now.

00:39:41.090 --> 00:39:43.440
Why do we have to go back and
look at these Gaussian curves?

00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:48.640
I told you that once we
calculated the likelihood

00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:52.230
ratio we could forget
about the curves.

00:39:52.230 --> 00:39:55.480
So why do I want to put
the curves back in?

00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:57.710
Well because I want to calculate
the probability of

00:39:57.710 --> 00:40:01.150
error at this point.

00:40:01.150 --> 00:40:01.900
OK?

00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:04.810
And it's easier to calculate the
probability of error if,

00:40:04.810 --> 00:40:08.150
in fact, I draw curve for
myself and I look at

00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:10.380
what's going on.

00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:12.420
So here's the threshold.

00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:18.220
Here's the density when H equals
one is the correct

00:40:18.220 --> 00:40:20.000
hypothesis.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.250
The probability of error is the
probability that when I

00:40:23.250 --> 00:40:29.970
send one, the observation is
going to be a random variable

00:40:29.970 --> 00:40:36.460
with this probability density
and if it's a wild case, and I

00:40:36.460 --> 00:40:41.190
got an enormous value of noise,
positive noise, the

00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:44.310
noise is going to push me over
that threshold there and I'm

00:40:44.310 --> 00:40:45.860
going to make a mistake.

00:40:45.860 --> 00:40:49.010
So, in fact, the probability
of error-- conditional on

00:40:49.010 --> 00:40:50.570
sending one--

00:40:50.570 --> 00:40:55.050
is just this probability of that
little space in there.

00:40:55.050 --> 00:40:55.350
OK?

00:40:55.350 --> 00:40:59.360
Which is the probability that
I'm going to say that zero

00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:02.330
occurred when, in fact,
one occurred.

00:41:02.330 --> 00:41:06.830
So that's my probability of
error when one occurs.

00:41:06.830 --> 00:41:09.660
What's the probability of
error when zero occurs?

00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:11.350
Well it's the same analysis.

00:41:11.350 --> 00:41:13.520
When zero occurs--

00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:16.620
mainly when the correct
hypothesis is zero--

00:41:16.620 --> 00:41:21.850
the output, v, follows this
probability density here.

00:41:21.850 --> 00:41:27.410
And I'm going to screw up if
the noise carries me beyond

00:41:27.410 --> 00:41:29.860
this point here.

00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:33.680
So you can see what the
threshold is doing now.

00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:38.150
I mean, when you choose a
threshold which is positive it

00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:43.560
makes it much harder to screw
up when you send a minus a.

00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:45.580
It makes it much easier
to screw up when

00:41:45.580 --> 00:41:47.750
you send a plus a.

00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:50.690
But you see that's what we
wanted to do, because the

00:41:50.690 --> 00:41:58.230
threshold was positive in this
case, because p1 was so much

00:41:58.230 --> 00:42:00.300
larger than p0.

00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:03.250
And because p1 is so much
larger than p0--

00:42:03.250 --> 00:42:06.800
p1 happens almost
all the time--

00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:10.320
and therefore you would normally
almost choose p1

00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:13.860
without looking at v. Which says
you want to push it over

00:42:13.860 --> 00:42:16.730
that way a little bit.

00:42:16.730 --> 00:42:21.630
OK, when you calculate this
probability of error, it's the

00:42:21.630 --> 00:42:26.650
probability of the tail of a
Gaussian random variable.

00:42:26.650 --> 00:42:33.790
So you define this tail
variable, q of x, is the

00:42:33.790 --> 00:42:36.710
complimentary distribution
function of a

00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:38.900
normal random variable.

00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:41.710
It's the integral from x to
infinity of one over the

00:42:41.710 --> 00:42:48.750
square root of 2pi, e to the
minus c squared over 2.

00:42:48.750 --> 00:42:51.890
I guess this would make better
sense if this were a z--

00:42:51.890 --> 00:42:54.510
one and--

00:42:54.510 --> 00:42:55.810
oh, no.

00:42:55.810 --> 00:42:57.800
No, I did it right
the first time.

00:42:57.800 --> 00:43:01.380
That's an x, because x is the
limit in there, you see.

00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:06.250
So I'm calculating all of the
probability density that's off

00:43:06.250 --> 00:43:08.550
to the right of x.

00:43:08.550 --> 00:43:13.900
And the probability of error
when H is equal to one is this

00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:17.640
probability-- which looks like
it's the tail on the negative

00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:20.120
side but if you think about
it a little bit, since the

00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:24.480
Gaussian curve is symmetric, you
can also look at it as a q

00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:32.070
function where now when you have
this is equal to zero,

00:43:32.070 --> 00:43:37.720
this corresponds to changing
this plus to a minus here and

00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:40.280
that's the only change.

00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:46.080
OK, so this looks a
little ugly and it

00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:49.410
looks a little strange.

00:43:49.410 --> 00:43:52.000
I mean you can sort
of interpret

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:55.180
this part of it here--

00:43:55.180 --> 00:43:57.780
I can interpret this
part if I'm using

00:43:57.780 --> 00:44:00.580
maximum likelihood decoding--

00:44:00.580 --> 00:44:04.390
maximum likelihood is mapped
decoding where the threshold

00:44:04.390 --> 00:44:05.270
is equal to one.

00:44:05.270 --> 00:44:08.360
In other words, it's where
you're assuming that the

00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:13.340
hypothesis is equally likely to
be zero or one-- a priori--

00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:17.330
which is a good assumption
almost always in communication

00:44:17.330 --> 00:44:22.680
because we work very hard in
doing source coding to make

00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:27.500
those binary digits equally
likely zero or one.

00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:29.420
And there are other reasons
for choosing maximum

00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:30.320
likelihood.

00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:34.020
If you don't know anything about
the probabilities it's a

00:44:34.020 --> 00:44:37.910
good assumption in a sort
of a max/min sense.

00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:42.130
It sort of limits how much you
can screw up by having the

00:44:42.130 --> 00:44:47.390
wrong probability, so it's a
very robust choice also.

00:44:47.390 --> 00:44:52.690
OK, but now this, we're taking
the ratio of a with the square

00:44:52.690 --> 00:44:54.580
root of n0.

00:44:54.580 --> 00:44:59.110
Well the square root of n0 over
2 is really the standard

00:44:59.110 --> 00:45:00.820
deviation of the noise.

00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:03.770
So what we're doing is comparing
the amount of input

00:45:03.770 --> 00:45:10.000
we've put in with the standard
deviation of the noise.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:11.260
Now does that make any sense?

00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:13.950
The probability of error
depends on that ratio?

00:45:13.950 --> 00:45:16.600
Well yeah, it makes a
whole lot of sense.

00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:19.540
Because if, for example, I
wanted to look at this problem

00:45:19.540 --> 00:45:22.450
in a different scaling
system--

00:45:22.450 --> 00:45:26.440
if this is volts and I want to
look at it in milli-volts--

00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:32.020
I'm going to divide a by, I'm
going to multiply a by 1000.

00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:35.670
I'm going to multiply the
standard deviation of the

00:45:35.670 --> 00:45:37.430
noise by 1000.

00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:39.660
Because one of the things we
always do here-- the way we

00:45:39.660 --> 00:45:42.390
choose n0 over 2--

00:45:42.390 --> 00:45:46.210
n0 over 2 is sort of a
meaningless quantity.

00:45:46.210 --> 00:45:52.990
It's the noise energy in one
degree of freedom in the

00:45:52.990 --> 00:45:56.920
scaling reference that we're
using for the data.

00:45:56.920 --> 00:45:57.890
OK?

00:45:57.890 --> 00:46:00.190
And that's the only definition
you can come up with that

00:46:00.190 --> 00:46:01.640
makes any sense.

00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:06.420
I mean you scale the data in
whatever way you please, and

00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:12.580
when we've gone from baseband
to passband, we in fact have

00:46:12.580 --> 00:46:19.140
multiplied the energy in the
input by a factor of two.

00:46:19.140 --> 00:46:21.510
And therefore, because of
that, we're going to--

00:46:21.510 --> 00:46:26.190
n0 at passband is going to be a
square root of 2 bigger than

00:46:26.190 --> 00:46:27.870
it is at baseband.

00:46:27.870 --> 00:46:31.150
If you don't like that,
live with it.

00:46:31.150 --> 00:46:33.140
That's the way it is.

00:46:33.140 --> 00:46:36.030
Nobody will change n0,
no matter who wants

00:46:36.030 --> 00:46:37.910
them to change it.

00:46:37.910 --> 00:46:40.870
OK, so this term make sense.

00:46:40.870 --> 00:46:48.080
It's the ratio of the signal
amplitude to the standard

00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:50.130
deviation of the noise.

00:46:50.130 --> 00:46:53.720
And that should be the only way
that the signal amplitude

00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:57.500
or the standard deviation of the
noise enters in, because

00:46:57.500 --> 00:47:00.250
it's really the ratio that
has to be important.

00:47:00.250 --> 00:47:04.070
Why this crazy term?

00:47:04.070 --> 00:47:09.410
Well if you look at the curve
you can sort of see why it is.

00:47:09.410 --> 00:47:13.300
The threshold test is comparing
the likelihood ratio

00:47:13.300 --> 00:47:15.250
of this curve with
the likelihood

00:47:15.250 --> 00:47:17.310
ratio of this curve.

00:47:17.310 --> 00:47:27.150
What's going to happen as
a gets very, very large?

00:47:27.150 --> 00:47:32.240
You move a out, and the thing
that's happening then is this

00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:36.460
curve-- which is now coming down
in a modest way here-- if

00:47:36.460 --> 00:47:39.370
you move a way out here, you're
going to have almost

00:47:39.370 --> 00:47:40.970
nothing there.

00:47:40.970 --> 00:47:44.750
And it's going to be going
down very fast.

00:47:44.750 --> 00:47:46.690
It's going to be going
down very fast

00:47:46.690 --> 00:47:50.470
relative to its magnitude.

00:47:50.470 --> 00:47:53.960
In other words the bigger
a gets, the bigger this

00:47:53.960 --> 00:47:57.850
difference is going to be
for any given threshold.

00:47:57.850 --> 00:48:03.370
And that's why you get a over
square root of n0 here.

00:48:03.370 --> 00:48:06.130
And here you get exactly
the opposite thing.

00:48:06.130 --> 00:48:09.400
That's because for a given
threshold, as this signal to

00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:17.730
noise ratio gets bigger, this
threshold term becomes almost

00:48:17.730 --> 00:48:20.560
totally unimportant.

00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:23.270
I mean you get so much
information out of the reading

00:48:23.270 --> 00:48:30.470
you're making, because it's
so reliable, that having a

00:48:30.470 --> 00:48:34.240
threshold is almost completely
irrelevant.

00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:35.990
And therefore you can sort
of forget about it.

00:48:35.990 --> 00:48:40.100
If a is very large, this
term is zilch.

00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:41.350
OK?

00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:45.770
So if you want to have reliable
communication and you

00:48:45.770 --> 00:48:49.000
use a large amount of single
noise ratio to get it, that's

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:55.320
another reason for forgetting
about whether the threshold is

00:48:55.320 --> 00:48:58.000
one or something else.

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:02.520
And we would certainly like to
deal with problems where the

00:49:02.520 --> 00:49:05.790
threshold is equal to one
because most people who

00:49:05.790 --> 00:49:10.820
remember q of a signal
to noise ratio.

00:49:10.820 --> 00:49:14.340
I don't know anybody who can
remember this formula.

00:49:14.340 --> 00:49:18.330
I'm sure there's some people,
but I don't think anybody who

00:49:18.330 --> 00:49:20.940
works in the communication
field ever thinks

00:49:20.940 --> 00:49:22.390
about this at all.

00:49:22.390 --> 00:49:25.020
Except the first time they
derive it and the say, "Oh,

00:49:25.020 --> 00:49:29.160
that's very nice." And then they
promptly forget about it.

00:49:29.160 --> 00:49:31.420
The only reason I think
about it more is I

00:49:31.420 --> 00:49:33.790
teach the course sometimes.

00:49:33.790 --> 00:49:35.780
Otherwise I would forget
about it, too.

00:49:41.730 --> 00:49:44.200
OK, which is what this says.

00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:48.390
For communication we assume
p0 is equal to p1.

00:49:48.390 --> 00:49:50.920
So we assume that eta
is equal to one.

00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:54.330
So the probability of error,
which is also the probability

00:49:54.330 --> 00:49:58.100
of error when H is equal to
one-- in other words when a

00:49:58.100 --> 00:50:01.230
one actually enters the
communication system-- is

00:50:01.230 --> 00:50:04.890
equal to the probability of
error when H is equal to 0.

00:50:04.890 --> 00:50:08.980
In other words these two tails
here, when the threshold is

00:50:08.980 --> 00:50:12.340
equal to one you set the
threshold right there.

00:50:12.340 --> 00:50:15.540
The probability of this tail
is clearly equal to the

00:50:15.540 --> 00:50:16.960
probability of this tail.

00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:19.400
Just by symmetry.

00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:22.280
So these two error probabilities
are the same.

00:50:22.280 --> 00:50:26.540
And in fact they are just
q of a over the square

00:50:26.540 --> 00:50:29.660
root of n0 over 2.

00:50:29.660 --> 00:50:31.870
It's nice to put this
in terms of energy.

00:50:31.870 --> 00:50:34.400
We said before that energy is
sort of important in the

00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:36.800
communication field.

00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:40.330
So we call e sub b the energy
per bit that we're

00:50:40.330 --> 00:50:42.900
spending to send data.

00:50:42.900 --> 00:50:45.020
I mean don't worry about the
fact that we're only sending

00:50:45.020 --> 00:50:48.150
one bit and then we're tearing
the communication system down.

00:50:48.150 --> 00:50:51.300
Because pretty soon we're going
to send multiple bits.

00:50:51.300 --> 00:50:55.830
But the amount of energy we're
spending sending this one bit

00:50:55.830 --> 00:50:57.970
is a squared.

00:50:57.970 --> 00:51:01.270
At least back in this frame of
reference that we're looking

00:51:01.270 --> 00:51:03.640
at now, where we're just looking
at this discrete

00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:08.980
signal and single
variable noise.

00:51:08.980 --> 00:51:14.010
And n0 over 2 is the noise
variance of this particular

00:51:14.010 --> 00:51:20.960
random variable, z, so when we
write this out in terms of Eb,

00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:27.010
which is a squared, it looks
like this-- it's 2eb over n0.

00:51:27.010 --> 00:51:31.970
So the probability of error for
this binary communication

00:51:31.970 --> 00:51:36.210
problem is just the square
root of 2Eb over n0.

00:51:36.210 --> 00:51:39.750
Which is a formula that
you want to remember.

00:51:39.750 --> 00:51:47.850
It's the error probability for
binary detection when n0 over

00:51:47.850 --> 00:51:55.520
2 is the noise energy on this
one degree of freedom and Eb

00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:57.680
is the amount of energy you're
spending on this

00:51:57.680 --> 00:52:00.660
one degree of freedom.

00:52:00.660 --> 00:52:02.960
You will see about
50 variations of

00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:06.090
this as we go on.

00:52:06.090 --> 00:52:11.220
If you try to remember this
fundamental definition, it'll

00:52:11.220 --> 00:52:14.210
save you a lot of agony.

00:52:14.210 --> 00:52:20.170
Even so, everybody I know who
deals with this kind of thing

00:52:20.170 --> 00:52:23.440
always screws up the
factors of twos.

00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:27.200
And finally when they get all
done, they try to figure out

00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:30.020
from common sense or from
something else, what the

00:52:30.020 --> 00:52:32.660
factors of two ought to be.

00:52:32.660 --> 00:52:35.850
And they reduce their
probability of error to about

00:52:35.850 --> 00:52:38.790
a quarter after they're all done
with doing all of that.

00:52:42.870 --> 00:52:46.490
OK, so we spent a lot
of time analyzing

00:52:46.490 --> 00:52:50.010
binary antipodal signals.

00:52:50.010 --> 00:52:53.430
What about the binary non
antipodal signals?

00:52:53.430 --> 00:52:57.530
This is beautiful example of
Shannon's idea of studying the

00:52:57.530 --> 00:52:58.910
simplest cases first.

00:53:01.660 --> 00:53:05.500
If you have two signals, one of
which is b and one of which

00:53:05.500 --> 00:53:14.330
is b prime, and they can be put
anywhere on the real line.

00:53:14.330 --> 00:53:17.140
And what I've done, because I
didn't want to plot this whole

00:53:17.140 --> 00:53:21.440
picture again, is I just took
the zero out, and I replaced

00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:25.650
the zero by the point halfway
between these two points which

00:53:25.650 --> 00:53:28.530
is b plus b prime over 2.

00:53:28.530 --> 00:53:33.040
And then we look at it and we
say what happens if you have

00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:38.500
an arbitrary set of two points
anywhere on the real line?

00:53:38.500 --> 00:53:44.900
Well when I send this point the
likelihood, conditional on

00:53:44.900 --> 00:53:48.350
this point being sent, is
this Gaussian curve

00:53:48.350 --> 00:53:50.470
centered on b prime.

00:53:50.470 --> 00:53:54.640
When I send b the likelihood
is a Gaussian

00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:57.310
curve centered on b.

00:53:57.310 --> 00:54:02.210
And it is in fact the same curve
that we drew before.

00:54:02.210 --> 00:54:06.870
If in fact I replaced zero with
a center point between

00:54:06.870 --> 00:54:10.930
these two, which is b
plus b prime over 2.

00:54:10.930 --> 00:54:28.500
And if I then define a as this
distance in here, the

00:54:28.500 --> 00:54:32.140
probability of error that I
calculated before is the same

00:54:32.140 --> 00:54:34.280
as it was before.

00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:40.050
Now I would suggest to all of
you that you try to find the

00:54:40.050 --> 00:54:46.700
probability of error for this
system here, just not using

00:54:46.700 --> 00:54:49.910
what we've already done, and
just writing out the

00:54:49.910 --> 00:54:53.160
likelihood ratios as a function
of an arbitrary b

00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:58.370
prime and an arbitrary b and
finding a likelihood ratio,

00:54:58.370 --> 00:55:00.640
and calculating through
all of that.

00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:04.760
And most of you are capable of
calculating through all of it.

00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:07.930
But when you do so, you will
get a god awful looking

00:55:07.930 --> 00:55:12.530
formula, which just looks
totally messy.

00:55:12.530 --> 00:55:17.360
And by looking at the formula
you are not going to be able

00:55:17.360 --> 00:55:20.540
to realize that what's going
on is what we see here from

00:55:20.540 --> 00:55:22.670
the picture.

00:55:22.670 --> 00:55:25.230
And the only reason we figured
out what was going like the

00:55:25.230 --> 00:55:27.610
picture is we already
solved the problem

00:55:27.610 --> 00:55:29.370
for the Simpson case.

00:55:29.370 --> 00:55:35.400
OK so it never makes any sense
in this problem to look at

00:55:35.400 --> 00:55:37.120
this general case.

00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:40.300
You always want to say the
general case is just a special

00:55:40.300 --> 00:55:43.360
case of a special case.

00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:48.110
Where you just have to define
things slightly differently.

00:55:48.110 --> 00:55:51.650
OK, so we're going to do the
center point, then, I mean it

00:55:51.650 --> 00:55:54.280
might be a pilot tone.

00:55:54.280 --> 00:55:58.600
It might be any other non
information bearing signal.

00:55:58.600 --> 00:56:00.900
In other words were sending
the one bit.

00:56:00.900 --> 00:56:03.470
Sometimes for some reason or
other, you need to get

00:56:03.470 --> 00:56:04.470
synchronization.

00:56:04.470 --> 00:56:07.470
You need to get other things
in a communication system.

00:56:07.470 --> 00:56:09.500
And for that reason, you
send other things.

00:56:09.500 --> 00:56:12.260
We'll talk about a lot
of those later.

00:56:12.260 --> 00:56:15.500
But they don't change the error
probability at all.

00:56:15.500 --> 00:56:19.370
The error probability is
determined solely by the

00:56:19.370 --> 00:56:21.910
distance between these two
points which we call 2a.

00:56:25.820 --> 00:56:28.660
So probability of error remains
the same in terms of

00:56:28.660 --> 00:56:30.310
this distance.

00:56:30.310 --> 00:56:33.020
The energy per bit
now changes.

00:56:33.020 --> 00:56:36.080
The energy per bit is
the energy here

00:56:36.080 --> 00:56:37.630
plus the energy here.

00:56:37.630 --> 00:56:40.270
Which in fact is the energy
in the center

00:56:40.270 --> 00:56:43.990
point plus a squared.

00:56:43.990 --> 00:56:46.390
I mean we've done that in a
number of contexts, the way to

00:56:46.390 --> 00:56:52.990
find the energy in a binary
random variable is to take the

00:56:52.990 --> 00:56:56.650
energy in the center point
plus the energy in the

00:56:56.650 --> 00:56:58.070
difference.

00:56:58.070 --> 00:57:02.040
It's the same as finding the
fluctuation plus the

00:57:02.040 --> 00:57:02.900
square of the mean.

00:57:02.900 --> 00:57:05.530
It's that same underlying
idea.

00:57:05.530 --> 00:57:10.280
So any time you use non
antipodal and you shift things

00:57:10.280 --> 00:57:13.840
off the mean, you can
see what's going

00:57:13.840 --> 00:57:15.840
on very, very easily.

00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:17.580
You waste energy.

00:57:17.580 --> 00:57:21.170
I mean it might not be wasted,
you might have to waste it for

00:57:21.170 --> 00:57:22.500
some reason.

00:57:22.500 --> 00:57:25.360
But as far as a communication
is concerned you're simply

00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:26.830
wasting it.

00:57:26.830 --> 00:57:30.960
So your energy per bit changes,
but your probability

00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:33.310
of error remains the same.

00:57:33.310 --> 00:57:38.450
Because of that, you get a very
clear cut idea of what

00:57:38.450 --> 00:57:42.040
it's costing you to send
that pilot tone.

00:57:42.040 --> 00:57:45.990
Because in fact what you've done
is to just increase this

00:57:45.990 --> 00:57:50.480
energy, which we talk about
in terms of db.

00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:54.340
If c is equal to a in this case
which, as will see, is a

00:57:54.340 --> 00:57:57.910
common thing that happens in a
lot of systems, what you've

00:57:57.910 --> 00:57:59.590
lost is a factor three db.

00:57:59.590 --> 00:58:02.970
Because you're using twice as
much energy which is three db

00:58:02.970 --> 00:58:05.850
more energy, than you have
to use for the pure

00:58:05.850 --> 00:58:07.590
communication.

00:58:07.590 --> 00:58:12.040
So it's costing you three db to
do whatever silly thing you

00:58:12.040 --> 00:58:14.960
want to do for synchronization
or something else.

00:58:14.960 --> 00:58:18.560
Which is why people work very
hard to try to send signals

00:58:18.560 --> 00:58:20.850
which carry their own
synchronization

00:58:20.850 --> 00:58:23.010
information in them.

00:58:23.010 --> 00:58:25.030
And we will talk about that more
when we get to wireless

00:58:25.030 --> 00:58:26.280
and things like that.

00:58:31.100 --> 00:58:31.960
OK.

00:58:31.960 --> 00:58:35.800
Let's go on to real antipodal
vectors in

00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:39.030
white Gaussian noise.

00:58:39.030 --> 00:58:42.160
And again, let me point out to
you again that one of the

00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:45.500
remarkable things about
detection theory is once you

00:58:45.500 --> 00:58:51.940
understand detection for
antipodal binary signals and

00:58:51.940 --> 00:58:54.510
Gaussian noise, everything
else just follows along.

00:58:58.260 --> 00:59:02.410
OK, so here what we're going to
do is to assume that under

00:59:02.410 --> 00:59:05.840
the hypothesis H equals zero--
in other words conditional on

00:59:05.840 --> 00:59:09.570
a zero entering the
communication system--

00:59:09.570 --> 00:59:14.700
what we're going to send is not
a single degree, is not

00:59:14.700 --> 00:59:16.960
something in a single
degree of freedom.

00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:19.470
But we're actually going
to send a vector.

00:59:19.470 --> 00:59:23.520
And you can think of that if you
want to as sending a way

00:59:23.520 --> 00:59:27.930
form and breaking up the
waveform into an orthonormal

00:59:27.930 --> 00:59:31.440
expansion and a1 to
ak as being the

00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:33.940
coefficients in that expansion.

00:59:33.940 --> 00:59:35.560
So we're going to use
several degrees of

00:59:35.560 --> 00:59:37.870
freedom to send one signal.

00:59:37.870 --> 00:59:38.210
Yes?

00:59:38.210 --> 00:59:42.750
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:59:42.750 --> 00:59:46.270
PROFESSOR: I'm only
sending one bit.

00:59:46.270 --> 00:59:50.100
And on Wednesday I'm going to
talk about what happens when

00:59:50.100 --> 00:59:54.400
we want to send multiple bits
or when we want to send a

00:59:54.400 --> 00:59:57.770
large number of signals in one
degree of freedom, or all

00:59:57.770 --> 01:00:01.040
those cases, multiple
hypotheses.

01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:03.640
You know what's going
to happen?

01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:06.750
It's going to turn out to be
a trivial problem again.

01:00:06.750 --> 01:00:10.560
Multiple hypotheses are no
harder than just binary

01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:12.560
hypotheses.

01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:15.720
So again, once you understand
the simplest case, all

01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:18.660
Gaussian problems turn
out to be solved.

01:00:18.660 --> 01:00:24.240
Just with minor variations
and minor tweaks.

01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:26.790
OK, so I have antipodal
vectors.

01:00:26.790 --> 01:00:30.020
One vector is a1 to a sub k.

01:00:30.020 --> 01:00:34.290
Under the other hypothesis we're
going to send minus a,

01:00:34.290 --> 01:00:36.550
which is the opposite vector.

01:00:36.550 --> 01:00:40.030
So if we're dealing with two
dimensional space with

01:00:40.030 --> 01:00:43.140
coordinates here and here,
if I send this I'm

01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:44.360
going to send this.

01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:47.330
If I send that I'm going to
send that, and so forth.

01:00:47.330 --> 01:00:51.030
As the opposite alternative.

01:00:51.030 --> 01:00:58.650
The likelihood ratio is then,
the probability of vector v

01:00:58.650 --> 01:01:02.140
conditional on sending this.

01:01:02.140 --> 01:01:06.780
I'm assuming here that the noise
is IID and each noise

01:01:06.780 --> 01:01:12.650
variable has mean zero and
variance n0 over 2.

01:01:12.650 --> 01:01:16.550
Namely, we're pretending we're
communication people here,

01:01:16.550 --> 01:01:18.430
using and n0 over 2 here.

01:01:18.430 --> 01:01:21.790
So the conditional density--

01:01:21.790 --> 01:01:27.090
the likelihood of this output
vector given zero-- is just

01:01:27.090 --> 01:01:32.350
this density of z shifted
over by a.

01:01:32.350 --> 01:01:37.580
So it's what we've talked about
as the Gaussian density.

01:01:37.580 --> 01:01:46.540
Just this, which is just the
energy in v minus a is what

01:01:46.540 --> 01:01:49.040
that turns out to be.

01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:55.460
So the log likelihood ratio is
the ratio of this quantity to

01:01:55.460 --> 01:01:58.270
the density where H
is equal to one.

01:01:58.270 --> 01:02:06.180
And when H is equal to one, what
happens is the same thing

01:02:06.180 --> 01:02:07.390
as happened before.

01:02:07.390 --> 01:02:14.040
One makes this sign turn
into a plus sign.

01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:17.550
So when I look at the log
likelihood ratio, I want to

01:02:17.550 --> 01:02:23.480
take the ratio of this quantity
to the same quantity

01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:26.110
with a plus put into it.

01:02:26.110 --> 01:02:29.250
And when I take the log of that,
what happens is I get

01:02:29.250 --> 01:02:32.990
this term minus the opposite
term of the opposite side.

01:02:32.990 --> 01:02:38.930
So I have minus the norm squared
of v minus a plus the

01:02:38.930 --> 01:02:43.650
norm squared of v
plus a over n0.

01:02:43.650 --> 01:02:46.080
And again, if you multiply
this out, the v squareds

01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:47.130
cancel out.

01:02:47.130 --> 01:02:48.950
The a squareds cancel out.

01:02:48.950 --> 01:02:51.460
And you just get the inner
product terms.

01:02:51.460 --> 01:02:54.060
And strangely enough you get the
same formula that you got

01:02:54.060 --> 01:02:58.130
before, almost, except here you
have the inner product of

01:02:58.130 --> 01:03:02.140
v with a instead of just the
product of v times a.

01:03:02.140 --> 01:03:06.440
So in fact we just have a slight
generalization of the

01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:09.140
thing that we did before.

01:03:09.140 --> 01:03:21.980
In other words, the
scalar product is

01:03:21.980 --> 01:03:25.100
a sufficient statistic.

01:03:25.100 --> 01:03:27.850
Now what does that tell you?

01:03:27.850 --> 01:03:30.900
It tells you how to
build a detector.

01:03:30.900 --> 01:03:31.350
OK?

01:03:31.350 --> 01:03:34.770
It tells you when you have a
vector detection problem, the

01:03:34.770 --> 01:03:40.440
thing that you want to do is to
take this vector, v, that

01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:47.260
you have and form the inner
product of v times a.

01:03:47.260 --> 01:03:51.350
If in fact v is a waveform
and a is a waveform,

01:03:51.350 --> 01:03:52.600
what do you do then?

01:03:56.140 --> 01:03:58.550
Well the first thing you
do is to think of

01:03:58.550 --> 01:04:01.730
v as being a vector--

01:04:01.730 --> 01:04:04.150
where it's the vector of
coefficients-- in the

01:04:04.150 --> 01:04:10.470
expansion for that waveform
and a in the same way.

01:04:10.470 --> 01:04:13.670
You look at what the inner
product is then, and then you

01:04:13.670 --> 01:04:16.860
say, "well what does that
correspond to when I deal with

01:04:16.860 --> 01:04:19.550
L2 waveforms?" What's the inner

01:04:19.550 --> 01:04:21.700
product for L2 waveforms?

01:04:26.620 --> 01:04:28.550
It's the integral of the product
of the waveforms.

01:04:31.260 --> 01:04:32.930
And how do you form the
integral of the

01:04:32.930 --> 01:04:35.770
product of the waveforms?

01:04:35.770 --> 01:04:38.520
You take this waveform here.

01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:44.770
You turn it around and you call
it a matched filter to a.

01:04:44.770 --> 01:04:46.890
And you take the received
waveform.

01:04:46.890 --> 01:04:50.280
You pass it through the max
filter for a, and you look at

01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:51.530
the output for it.

01:04:53.960 --> 01:05:01.820
Now, let's go back and look at
what all of this was doing.

01:05:01.820 --> 01:05:04.560
And for now let's forget
about the baseband to

01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:05.730
the passband business.

01:05:05.730 --> 01:05:10.070
Let's just look at this part
here because it's a little

01:05:10.070 --> 01:05:11.670
easier to see this first.

01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:23.540
So this comes in here.

01:05:23.540 --> 01:05:25.120
Now remember what
we were saying

01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:26.530
when we studied Nyquist.

01:05:26.530 --> 01:05:32.095
We said a neat thing to do was
to use a square root of the

01:05:32.095 --> 01:05:34.640
Nyquist pulse at the
transmitter.

01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:37.040
When you use a square root of
the Nyquist pulse at the

01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:41.920
transmitter, what you have is
orthogonality between the

01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:44.140
pulse and all of its shifts.

01:05:44.140 --> 01:05:46.760
Well now we don't much care
about the orthogonality

01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:49.820
between the pulse and all of the
shifts because we're only

01:05:49.820 --> 01:05:52.930
sending this one bit anyway.

01:05:52.930 --> 01:05:54.990
But it sort of looks like we're
going to be able to put

01:05:54.990 --> 01:05:58.180
that back in in a nice
convenient way.

01:05:58.180 --> 01:06:02.000
So we're sending this one pulse,
p of t, city and what

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.150
did we do in this baseband
demodulator?

01:06:06.670 --> 01:06:11.050
We passed this through another
filter, q of t, which was the

01:06:11.050 --> 01:06:14.620
matched filter to p of t.

01:06:14.620 --> 01:06:19.220
What's our optimal detector
for maximum likelihood?

01:06:19.220 --> 01:06:22.490
It's to take whatever this
waveform was, pass it through

01:06:22.490 --> 01:06:23.550
the matched filter.

01:06:23.550 --> 01:06:26.120
In other words, to calculate
that inner product we just

01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:28.990
talked about.

01:06:28.990 --> 01:06:30.570
OK?

01:06:30.570 --> 01:06:34.090
So in fact when we were looking
at the Nyquist problem

01:06:34.090 --> 01:06:37.990
and worrying about inner symbol
interference, in fact

01:06:37.990 --> 01:06:41.590
what we were doing was also
doing the first part of an

01:06:41.590 --> 01:06:44.390
optimal MAP detector.

01:06:44.390 --> 01:06:48.760
And at this point what comes
out of here is a single

01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:54.740
number, v, which in fact now is
the inner product of this

01:06:54.740 --> 01:06:57.330
waveform at this point.

01:06:57.330 --> 01:07:01.450
With the waveform,
a, that we sent.

01:07:01.450 --> 01:07:02.860
OK?

01:07:02.860 --> 01:07:05.800
In other words, we started out
by saying, "let's suppose that

01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:08.280
what we have here is a number.

01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:12.390
What's the optimal detector to
build?" And then we go on and

01:07:12.390 --> 01:07:15.850
say, "OK, let's suppose we
look at the problem here.

01:07:15.850 --> 01:07:19.730
What's the optimal detector to
build now?" And the optimal

01:07:19.730 --> 01:07:23.850
detector to build now at this
point is this matched filter

01:07:23.850 --> 01:07:25.100
to this input waveform.

01:07:27.610 --> 01:07:30.770
Followed by the inner product
here-- which is what the match

01:07:30.770 --> 01:07:35.250
filter does for us-- followed
by our binary antipodal

01:07:35.250 --> 01:07:37.620
detector again.

01:07:37.620 --> 01:07:40.080
OK?

01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:44.770
So by studying the problem at
this point, we now understand

01:07:44.770 --> 01:07:46.100
what happens at this point.

01:07:51.050 --> 01:07:53.760
And do I have time to show you
what happens at this point?

01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:55.380
I don't know.

01:07:55.380 --> 01:07:56.630
Let me--

01:08:03.270 --> 01:08:07.710
let's not do that at
least right now--

01:08:07.710 --> 01:08:10.520
let's look at the picture of
this that we get when we just

01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:15.200
look at the problem when
we have two dimensions.

01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:18.940
So we're either going to
transmit a vector, a, or we're

01:08:18.940 --> 01:08:20.910
going to transmit a
vector, minus a.

01:08:20.910 --> 01:08:23.100
And think of this in
two dimensions.

01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:26.050
When we transmit the
vector, a, we have

01:08:26.050 --> 01:08:28.100
two dimensional noise.

01:08:28.100 --> 01:08:31.490
We've already pointed out that
two dimensional Gaussian noise

01:08:31.490 --> 01:08:32.750
has circular symmetry.

01:08:32.750 --> 01:08:35.530
Spherical symmetry in an
arbitrary number of dimension.

01:08:35.530 --> 01:08:38.740
So what happens is you get
these equal probability

01:08:38.740 --> 01:08:42.930
regions which are spreading out
like when you drop a rock

01:08:42.930 --> 01:08:45.360
into a pool of water.

01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:49.240
You see all of these things
spreading out in circles.

01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:56.120
And you then say, "OK, what's
this inner product going to

01:08:56.120 --> 01:09:01.330
correspond to?" Finding the
inner product and comparing it

01:09:01.330 --> 01:09:03.480
with a threshold.

01:09:03.480 --> 01:09:06.940
Well you can see geometrically
what's going to happen here.

01:09:06.940 --> 01:09:11.090
You're trying to do maximum
likelihood.

01:09:11.090 --> 01:09:13.230
And we already know we're
supposed to calculate the

01:09:13.230 --> 01:09:16.260
inner product, so what the inner
product is going to do

01:09:16.260 --> 01:09:19.250
is take whatever v that we
receive-- it's going to

01:09:19.250 --> 01:09:25.920
project it on to this line
between 0 and a.

01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:30.020
So if I got a v here I'm going
to project it down to here.

01:09:30.020 --> 01:09:32.210
And then what I'm going to do
is I'm going to compare the

01:09:32.210 --> 01:09:34.600
distance from here to there
with the distance

01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:36.680
from here to there.

01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:41.160
Which says first project, then
do the old decision in a one

01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:42.510
dimensional way.

01:09:42.510 --> 01:09:47.910
Now geometrically, this distance
squared is equal to

01:09:47.910 --> 01:09:50.850
this distance squared plus
this distance squared.

01:09:50.850 --> 01:09:53.880
And this distance squared is
equal to the same distance

01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:56.920
squared plus this distance
squared.

01:09:56.920 --> 01:10:00.980
So whatever you decide to do in
terms of these distances,

01:10:00.980 --> 01:10:04.280
you will also decide to do in
terms of these distances.

01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:07.940
Which also means that the
maximum likelihood regions

01:10:07.940 --> 01:10:10.470
that you're going to develop,
or in fact the maximum a

01:10:10.470 --> 01:10:15.480
posteriori probability regions
are simply planes.

01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:18.520
Which are perpendicular
to the line between

01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:21.330
minus a and plus a.

01:10:21.330 --> 01:10:22.520
OK?

01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:24.650
So if you're doing maximum
likelihood you just form a

01:10:24.650 --> 01:10:27.330
plane halfway between
these two points.

01:10:27.330 --> 01:10:27.560
Yeah?

01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:42.100
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

01:10:42.100 --> 01:10:44.990
PROFESSOR: We got the error
probability just by first

01:10:44.990 --> 01:10:48.820
doing the projection and then
turning it into this scale or

01:10:48.820 --> 01:10:50.500
problem again.

01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:51.830
So in fact the error
probability--

01:10:51.830 --> 01:10:52.770
What?

01:10:52.770 --> 01:10:55.870
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

01:10:55.870 --> 01:10:58.110
PROFESSOR: The probability of
error is just the probability

01:10:58.110 --> 01:10:59.940
of error in the projection.

01:10:59.940 --> 01:11:02.860
Did I write it down someplace?

01:11:02.860 --> 01:11:04.770
Oh yeah, I did write it down.

01:11:08.100 --> 01:11:14.000
But I wrote it down, well
I sort of cheated.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.980
It's in the notes.

01:11:16.980 --> 01:11:21.330
I mean the likelihood ratio is
just a center product here

01:11:21.330 --> 01:11:23.410
which is a number.

01:11:23.410 --> 01:11:26.290
And when you find the error
probability, you just use the

01:11:26.290 --> 01:11:30.030
same q formula that
we used before.

01:11:30.030 --> 01:11:32.360
And in place of a
you substitute--

01:11:36.700 --> 01:11:42.800
in place of a you substitute the
inner product of v with a.

01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:45.180
Which is the corresponding
quantity.

01:11:45.180 --> 01:12:01.080
So it's q of 4va
divided by n0.

01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:02.510
OK?

01:12:02.510 --> 01:12:07.780
So that's the maximum likelihood
error probability.

01:12:07.780 --> 01:12:08.010
OK?

01:12:08.010 --> 01:12:11.870
In other words, nothing
new has happened here.

01:12:11.870 --> 01:12:15.900
You just go through the match
filter and then you do this

01:12:15.900 --> 01:12:19.470
same one dimensional problem
that we've already

01:12:19.470 --> 01:12:21.620
figured out how to do.

01:12:21.620 --> 01:12:26.090
I think I'm going to stop there
and we'll do the complex

01:12:26.090 --> 01:12:33.410
case which really corresponds to
what happens after baseband

01:12:33.410 --> 01:12:35.160
to passband then passband
to baseband.
