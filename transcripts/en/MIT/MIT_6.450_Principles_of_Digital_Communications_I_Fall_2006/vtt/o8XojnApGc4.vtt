00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.440
PROFESSOR: I'm going to review
what we did with the craft

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.640
inequality just a little bit,
because evidently a number of

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.650
people were confused
about this.

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.410
I'm going to put a little more
notation in with it.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.850
For some people,
notation helps.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.110
For other people, it
hinders things.

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.780
But after you've thought about
it a little bit, a little more

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.630
notation can certainly
be helpful.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.470
What we're trying to do in
this craft inequality is,

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.920
we're thinking of a set of
symbols where, supposing that

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.050
there's a codeword for each
symbol, c of x is the codeword

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.330
for symbol x, which is a string
of binary digits.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.240
y1 up to y sub n.

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:10.150
In the world of two-toed sloths,
the representation of

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.700
numbers that sloths use
is binary, base 2.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.820
And therefore, they use the
number associated with some

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.090
sequence of bits like this would
be the sum of y sub i,

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.070
times 2 to the minus i.

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.110
In other words, it's the same
thing as a decimal, except

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.760
it's in a world where
people have two

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.210
fingers instead of ten.

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.420
There's an interval associated
with this number, also.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.800
And the interval is what you
would get if you took an

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:48.360
arbitrary real number and
rounded it down to l sub i.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.220
Well, in this case to
m binary digits.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.500
So that interval, then,
is the number itself.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.460
And the other side of
the interval is that

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.250
number itself --

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.050
the two-toed sloth didn't like
what I was going to say about

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.810
it, and it changed my slide.

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.670
So, is that extra factor the
2 to the minus n, there.

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.910
In other words, any number in
that range, if you round it

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.550
down to m significant binary
digits is going to the this

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.240
number here.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:38.520
Well the point of this, if the
number, namely, this base 2

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:45.590
expansion of a number y prime is
in this interval, then y is

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.530
going to be a prefix
of y prime.

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.070
Let me just give you some
examples of that because

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.050
saying it in words
is confusing, the

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.190
idea is very simple.

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.650
Suppose you have a binary
string, 011.

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.480
That corresponds to
the number 3/8.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.590
Namely, 1/4 plus 1/8.

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:15.000
And the interval there is going
to be the interval from

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.640
3/8, including 3/8, up to 1/4.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.070
But not including 1/4.

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:27.850
Namely, 1/4 will be represented
as -- the sloth

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.240
really is hitting hard
this morning.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.980
Maybe I'm the sloth.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:34.460
OK.

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:35.350
There we go.

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.270
From 3/8 to 1/2.

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:40.590
Namely, 1/2 is just 1.

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:41.590
Nothing more than that.

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.680
Or it could be 10 or
100, and so forth.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:52.940
So then, as an example, 011 is
going to be a prefix of all of

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:54.420
these quantities here.

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:00.880
That's a prefix of 0111 because
0111 is 3/8 plus 1/16,

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.260
which is in that interval
we're talking about.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.460
0110 is a more interesting
case.

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:11.280
Because 0110 is itself,
the number associated

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.650
with it, is just 3/8.

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.090
But what this is saying is, if
you take the same number but

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.320
expand it to four digits,
according to what this says, r

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.360
of y like is then in
this interval.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.570
And therefore this prefix
situation holds.

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.750
So this is a prefix of this.

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.940
Why do I make it
so complicated?

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.750
I make it so complicated because
I want to talk about

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.360
the length of that interval.

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.160
And the length of these
intervals is denoted in this

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.670
diagram here.

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:48.990
Anytime I have a number
expressed to n binary digits,

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.170
it covers an interval
of 2 to the minus n.

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:56.850
And because of this prefix
property, as soon as one

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:01.720
number covers an interval, no
other number have its base in

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.290
that interval.

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:06.270
In other words, all of these
intervals have to be disjoint,

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.950
exactly as is indicated here.

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:12.040
So when you add up the size of
all these intervals, you have

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.520
to get something less
than or equal to 1.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:15.920
And that's the proof of
the craft inequality.

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:25.440
So, let's go on and talk about
discrete source probabilities.

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:38.510
Now the two-toed sloth has
gotten his machine out there,

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:41.070
he's really mad at
me this morning.

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:45.340
If we try to model English
text, you know that some

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.980
letters are far more probable
than others.

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:50.900
Namely, if you take an enormous
amount of English

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.760
text and you measure the
relative frequency with which

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:57.740
each letter occurs, you'll get
more or less stable relative

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.310
frequencies if you
take enough text.

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:04.130
And these letters are far more
probable than these letters.

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.180
So that gives you
part of a model.

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:10.450
You can also say that successive
letters are going

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:12.480
to be very dependent.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:17.200
Namely, t is very often followed
by h, and h is often

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.070
preceded by t.

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:24.750
q u is even more of a case
here, because as far as

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:30.140
English language words are
concerned, u always follows q.

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:32.010
Some letter strings are words.

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:34.750
Other letter strings
are not words.

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:37.300
There are constraints
on grammar.

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.580
And what is really the clincher,
which says there's

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:44.570
no way you're going to model
English in any sensible nice

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:47.550
way, is meaning.

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:51.340
And even worse than that,
depending on who writes the

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:55.920
English, it might have meaning
or it might not have meaning.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:00.900
And for those English texts that
don't have any meaning,

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:04.420
the entropy is going to depend
very much on whether the

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:07.840
meaningless text is written by
a salesperson or it's written

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:09.640
by James Joyce.

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:14.100
And in one case you have --

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:18.790
well, in one case you have an
enormous amount of freedom in

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:20.580
what this sequence
of letters are.

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:22.780
And in the other case you have
letters which are very, very

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:24.450
constrained.

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:26.110
So what's the point of this?

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:31.220
The point of this is, if you're
interested in trying to

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:36.070
find the source coding method
for English, what you don't

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:39.330
want to do is to start out
trying to get the best

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:42.390
statistical model of English
that you can.

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:44.780
Because it's a losing
proposition.

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:48.740
And by trying to do that, you'll
spend all your time

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:50.220
trying to get the model.

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:53.330
And you won't get any insight
into what you ought to do as

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:55.620
far as source coding
is concerned.

00:07:55.620 --> 00:08:00.800
This is pretty much true
throughout all of technology.

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:04.710
You don't solve problems by
first getting too far into the

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:07.970
details of what the problem is,
before you start thinking

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:10.860
about structures of possible
solutions.

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:14.520
In other words, we always deal
with technological problems by

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:17.520
dealing with toy
problems first.

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:20.640
Now, there's a difference
between engineers who worry

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:22.480
about toy problems.

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:25.910
Because engineers, if they hate
theory, usually, don't

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:27.740
say what the toy problem is.

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:30.750
But they have that toy problem
very firmly in the back of

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:33.510
their mind, because of
all their experience.

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:36.700
Theoreticians, on the other
hand, make their models very,

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:38.860
very explicit.

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:41.460
They don't often like to say
that they're toy models

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:44.310
because DARPA doesn't tend to
support things that are

00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:45.820
working on toy models.

00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:47.560
So they try to conceal this.

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:49.310
And often they just
hide the fact that

00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:51.230
they're using a model.

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:53.670
So, all of this becomes
very complicated.

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:57.570
But, for you, if you're trying
to do either engineering or

00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:03.270
mathematics or teaching, or
just be a sensible person.

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:06.700
When you're dealing with these
problems, be explicit about

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:08.100
what your models are.

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:11.140
Try to understand the toy
problems before you understand

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:12.810
the more complicated problems.

00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:15.140
If you understand that out of
this course, it'll be a

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:17.400
worthwhile course for you.

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:21.190
And, of course, you won't
understand it until you get

00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:23.090
lots more experience.

00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:25.420
But believe me, that's
the way it is.

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:27.810
OK, so that's the whole
point of this.

00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:30.010
You want to start with
simple toy models.

00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:32.060
And I'm not just justifying the
fact that we're going to

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:35.690
study this incredibly
simple model here,

00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:38.010
which is a toy model.

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:40.390
But by studying this
you will see that

00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:42.300
everything else follows.

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:45.890
If you read Claude Shannon's
work on information theory,

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:47.830
this, in fact, is where
he started.

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:51.335
He started with a beautiful
description of trying to model

00:09:51.335 --> 00:09:52.840
the English language.

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:56.420
Finally wound up with
talking about this.

00:09:56.420 --> 00:10:00.110
The conclusions he drew, from
studying these discrete memory

00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:03.880
sources, lead to his general
theorems about data

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:05.660
compression on sources.

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:08.280
They led to his general
theorems about

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:10.400
the capacity of channels.

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:13.870
They led to the idea that you
want to separate source coding

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:17.710
from channel coding, and
finally, they led to all of

00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:20.730
the modern ideas that we have
about quantization.

00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:23.670
In other words, the simple
ideas you get out of this

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:27.070
generalize directly to
everything that's known about

00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:29.250
information theory.

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:30.210
So.

00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:33.930
Enough philosophy, let's get on
with the business of what

00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:35.650
we're trying to do.

00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:40.670
A discrete memoryless sources
has the following properties.

00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:45.770
The source output has to be an
unending sequence, x1, x2, x3,

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:49.880
blah, blah, blah, of random
letters drawn from a finite

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:52.110
alphabet, x.

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:55.560
In other words, we are taking
these real sources.

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:58.050
And we're saying, let's make
them not real now.

00:10:58.050 --> 00:11:01.010
Let's put a probability
measure on them.

00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:03.800
And in this probability measure,
one of the things

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:07.510
that the probability measure
will do will be to describe

00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:11.670
the probability on each one of
these letters and the sequence

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:13.520
in which it's coming
out of the source.

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:18.290
Each source output, x1, x2,
blah, blah, blah, is selected

00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:20.170
from a common alphabet.

00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:22.930
Namely, if you're using English
on one letter of the

00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:24.910
sequence, you're going to
use English on every

00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:27.200
letter of the sequence.

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:30.260
Going to use a common
probability measure, with some

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:34.600
probability mass function
p sub x of x.

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:38.720
This notation means this is the
probability mass function

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:42.890
for the chance variable X. A
chance variable is like a

00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:45.970
random variable, except
the objects are

00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:47.300
not necessarily numbers.

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:49.010
The objects can be anything.

00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:50.270
So, a chance variable is a

00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:53.330
generalization of a random variable.

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:56.440
So this probability mass
function talks about the

00:11:56.440 --> 00:12:01.700
probability of each of the
symbols in this alphabet x.

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:05.370
Then the final thing is, each
source output, x sub k, is

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:10.030
statistically independent of all
other source outputs, x1

00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:14.440
up x k minus 1, and x k
plus 1 on to forever.

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:17.520
This is a nice example, because
if you're going to

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:21.610
specify a source
probabilistically, you have to

00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:24.590
somehow find a way of
explaining what the

00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:29.610
probability of every possible
event within this source is.

00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:32.210
This is an easy way
of doing it.

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:33.630
You say they're independent.

00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:35.780
And then you can find the
probability of anything you

00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:37.320
want to find.

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:39.740
So that's a generic
way of putting

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:41.520
probability measures on things.

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:51.890
So then, we want to go into the
idea of prefix-free codes

00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:53.890
for these discrete memory
of the sources.

00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:57.060
We've already talked about
prefix-free codes.

00:12:57.060 --> 00:13:02.000
We talked about the
craft inequality.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.380
You might have thought it was
a little bit strange talking

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:08.480
about the strictly combinatorial
property of

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:13.080
codes without talking at all
about the probabilities, which

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:15.740
are the things that led us into
talking about these codes

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:16.500
in the first place.

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:21.290
Namely, we want to use unequal
length, variable length codes.

00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:24.710
Because of the fact that some
letters are more likely than

00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:26.070
other letters.

00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:28.540
And eventually we'll be using
them because of all these

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:31.870
constraints between
different words.

00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:36.080
So, for notation, let l of x be
the length of the codeword

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:41.140
for letter x in, the alphabet
capital X. ok so that's the

00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:43.930
same as this y1 y2
up to y sub n.

00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:47.320
At some strength of
binary symbols.

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:53.120
Capital L of x is a random
variable, where capital L of x

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:57.270
is equal to little l of x, where
capital X equal to x.

00:13:57.270 --> 00:13:59.030
Now, what the heck
does that mean?

00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:00.770
It's just notation.

00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:03.610
In other words, what we're
starting out with is this

00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:05.780
ensemble of letters.

00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:09.700
We have a probability assignment
on each letter in

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:11.140
that alphabet.

00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:14.440
And then what we would like
to talk about is a length

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:16.520
function on those letters.

00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:20.310
So we have little l of x, which
is defined for each x.

00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:23.670
We then want to talk about this
as a random variable.

00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:29.590
Because when we choose some
random letter, x, little x, of

00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:36.720
this ensemble, capital X, l of
x becomes a random variable.

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:39.390
We will always, in this course,
use capital letters to

00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:41.250
talk about random variables.

00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:44.710
And we will always use little
letters to talk about things

00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:46.900
which are not random
variables.

00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:49.690
Excuse me, not not random
variables but random variables

00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:51.260
or chance variables.

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:54.160
I think we can probably
leave it open now.

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:58.150
It seems as if the sloth
has gone away.

00:14:58.150 --> 00:15:00.240
So then we want to talk
about the expected

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:01.890
value of the length.

00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:04.380
You talk about the expected
value of something, you're

00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:08.570
talking about the expected value
of a random variable.

00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:11.990
We will also denote the expected
value of this random

00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:16.060
variable L with a bar over it,
which is the sum over the

00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:20.810
letters in the alphabet,
of p of x times L of x.

00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:24.080
So all this is what you would do
anyway if you never thought

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:26.120
about this.

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:28.190
Until, at some point, when
you're taking a quiz or

00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:30.130
something and start to get
confused and say, what is this

00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:31.490
stuff all about?

00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:34.160
I don't have any idea what
this means after you've

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:35.730
written five pages of stuff.

00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:39.210
So, it's worthwhile spending
a little bit of time

00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:41.220
sorting that out.

00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:43.800
So, L bar is the number
of encoder output

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:46.260
bits per source symbol.

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.170
In some strange sense.

00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:50.420
Namely, it's this
expected value.

00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:55.950
Now, to finish this off, if we
want to look at the number of

00:15:55.950 --> 00:15:59.280
binary digits to come out of
the source when a long

00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:05.900
sequence of letters come
out of the source --

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:09.690
A long sequence of letters. x1,
x2, x3, and so forth, come

00:16:09.690 --> 00:16:10.860
out of the source.

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:12.180
They go into the encoder.

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:15.410
The encoder is mapping each
letter that comes out of the

00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:19.540
source into this codeword
c of x.

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:23.090
So we have a sequence of
codewords which are all

00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:25.160
concatenated together.

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:29.150
And, therefore, the total number
of binary digits which

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:34.850
has come out of the source
corresponding to these n

00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:39.120
symbols that have come out of
the source, is the sum of L of

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:45.050
x1 plus L of x2 plus of x3 plus
L of x4, and so forth.

00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:49.350
So we have a sum of independent
random variables.

00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:50.970
Now, what do you know
about sums of

00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:53.200
independent random variables?

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:55.880
Well, the one thing you ought
to know about, and which

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:59.940
should be stamped on your brain
because it's the central

00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:03.950
thing that makes any
probabilistic theory make

00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:07.170
sense, it's the only way that
we can ever understand our

00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:08.060
environment.

00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:09.700
You look at the past.

00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:11.600
You try to figure out
from the past what's

00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:13.150
going on in the future.

00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:16.030
And the only way you can do
that, the only tool you have,

00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:19.270
really, is this law
of large, numbers.

00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:22.390
Which says, when you see a long
sequence of things, from

00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:25.570
that long sequence of things,
you sort of figure out

00:17:25.570 --> 00:17:26.700
what's going on.

00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:28.900
If you're dealing with a random
variable, the thing you

00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:31.460
do is add up all of
these numbers.

00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:34.480
You divide by the total number
of them that you have.

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:36.440
And that gives you the
expected value.

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:38.080
It gives you a typical value.

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:41.710
What the law of large numbers
really says is, if you look at

00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:46.910
the sum of binary digits out of
this encoder, over a very

00:17:46.910 --> 00:17:51.970
long period of time, divide by
the total number of symbols,

00:17:51.970 --> 00:17:54.510
that's a random variable
again.

00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:57.430
And this random variable is,
with high probability, going

00:17:57.430 --> 00:18:02.160
to be very, very close to this
expected value, which is this

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:04.040
quantity here.

00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:07.520
In other words, the ensemble
average, which is this, is

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:10.360
going to be very close
to the time average.

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:12.820
And the time average, now,
is a random variable.

00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:15.930
And that's what the law
of large numbers says.

00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:19.840
You see, the problem that we
all have, dealing with real

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:23.680
world problems, is that there's
nobody to tell us this

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:25.920
is what the ensemble is.

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:29.290
Unless you believe somebody
that doesn't know.

00:18:29.290 --> 00:18:31.100
And the only real evidence
that you have

00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:32.790
is the actual sequence.

00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:36.650
And from the actual sequence,
you then look at what happens

00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:38.400
for this particular sequence.

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:40.080
You then build a model.

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:44.480
And your model, by definition,
has the expected value of L

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:48.060
going to be equal to the
expected value in the model

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:49.310
that you've chosen.

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:52.080
So.

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:54.600
What's your objective?

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:59.430
Your objective in trying to form
a prefix-free code, then,

00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:04.850
is to find a set of integers,
L of x, which satisfy the

00:19:04.850 --> 00:19:07.110
Kraft inequality.

00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:10.070
And they minimize L bar.

00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:12.470
In other words, what we're
trying to do is, we're trying

00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:15.610
to choose a code which minimizes
the expected length

00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:16.530
of the code.

00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:19.250
Which is really, over a long
period of time, going to

00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:23.620
minimize the number of binary
digits that come out of the

00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:25.670
source encoder.

00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:29.060
What we want to do is to choose
these integers to

00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:31.070
minimize this.

00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:34.530
So what we're going to do now
is, suppose our alphabet is

00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:38.670
just 1, 2, up to capital N.
What am I doing here?

00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:41.090
I'm saying, we don't care about
what these symbols are

00:19:41.090 --> 00:19:43.030
called, anyway.

00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:45.890
It's totally irrelevant what the
names of the symbols are.

00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:52.360
So I will name them 1, 2, up to
capital N. Probability mass

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:56.790
function, then, I can denote as
p sub 1 up to p sub capital

00:19:56.790 --> 00:19:59.510
N. In other words I've gotten
rid of all these axes that

00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:02.720
were lousing up our equations
all along.

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:07.310
Now, I'll denote the unknown
lengths by l1 up to l sub M.

00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:12.180
So the problem is, somebody
gives you this set of numbers.

00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:15.500
p1 to p sub M, which is a PMF.

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:18.920
In other words, these
numbers add up to 1.

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:22.670
And tells you, I want a
prefix-free code which

00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:25.860
minimizes this expected
length.

00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:29.695
Namely, the expected value
corresponding to

00:20:29.695 --> 00:20:31.700
these lengths here.

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:36.080
So, the expected length, to
minimize it, what we want to

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:40.630
do is to minimize over the
choice of l1 up to l sub M.

00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:43.570
Subject to the craft inequality,
we want to

00:20:43.570 --> 00:20:46.020
minimize this expected value.

00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:49.710
So we have a nice, clean,
mathematical problem now.

00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:54.420
We want to minimize this sum,
subject to this constraint.

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:56.850
And the constraint includes
the fact that all of these

00:20:56.850 --> 00:20:59.380
things have to be integers.

00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:03.040
Well, for those of you who have
studied minimization,

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:06.030
there's a funny thing in here.

00:21:06.030 --> 00:21:08.960
Because integer minimization
problems tend to

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:11.800
be very, very nasty.

00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:14.740
And, therefore, you look at
this and you say, this is

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:19.020
probably something I'm going
to have trouble solving.

00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:20.930
Strangely enough, it isn't.

00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:22.930
But you would think it probably
is something which

00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:25.520
will be hard to solve.

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:30.420
So, since integers louse
up minimization

00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:32.430
problems, what do we do?

00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:35.230
Well, we say, just for fun
let's try to solve this

00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:38.150
problem without the integer
constraint on it.

00:21:38.150 --> 00:21:40.920
Let's see what that leads
to, and see if we can do

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:42.250
anything with that.

00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:46.150
So we say, OK, let's try to
minimize this function here

00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:51.110
over the integers l1 to l sub M,
subject to this constraint.

00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:55.890
So we're minimizing this,
subject to this constraint.

00:21:55.890 --> 00:21:59.332
Now, an easy way to
do that -- yes.

00:21:59.332 --> 00:21:59.834
AUDIENCE: Are you

00:21:59.834 --> 00:22:05.360
saying that side length is
not a fixed probability.

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:07.650
PROFESSOR: No, I still have
these fixed probabilities.

00:22:07.650 --> 00:22:12.860
I still have p1 up to p sub
M, as known probabilities.

00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:16.040
But I'm going to say, let's
suppose I can choose a length

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:19.360
which is two point five bits
instead of two bits.

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:21.817
AUDIENCE: You're saying
the shortest length

00:22:21.817 --> 00:22:23.240
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:26.040
PROFESSOR: Well, we're going to
wind up there eventually.

00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:29.800
But for now, all I want to do
is to look at this problem.

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:33.150
If I start out by saying, assign
shortest lengths to the

00:22:33.150 --> 00:22:36.000
biggest probabilities,
I have two problems.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.690
One is, it's a little hard
to prove to you that

00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:39.970
I want to do that.

00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:42.610
Although we'll do that
later today.

00:22:42.610 --> 00:22:46.170
And the other is, it doesn't
really give you the general

00:22:46.170 --> 00:22:49.120
properties that we want
to know about this.

00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:53.640
So, for those two reasons, I
want to just attack this as a

00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:57.620
straightforward mathematical
problem.

00:22:57.620 --> 00:23:00.490
If you're a computer scientist,
this looks strange.

00:23:00.490 --> 00:23:03.370
Because computer scientists
like to attack problems by

00:23:03.370 --> 00:23:05.660
algorithms.

00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:09.150
Analog engineers like to attack
problems by writing a

00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:12.400
complicated formula, and taking
derivatives, and all

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:13.800
sorts of things like that.

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:15.340
We're going to be doing
both of those

00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:16.750
things in this course.

00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:19.210
And you'll see that both
of them lead to certain

00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:20.490
advantages.

00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:26.015
And here, we're taking, where
the analog engineer's approach

00:23:26.015 --> 00:23:28.830
is saying, suppose this
is a bunch of numbers.

00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:32.100
I want to minimize this
function over a set of

00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:36.100
numbers, l1 up to
l sub capital M.

00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:37.910
So, how do I do that?

00:23:37.910 --> 00:23:41.870
Well, this guy Lagrange, he
was a great mathematician.

00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:44.760
He was also a great
mathematician early enough

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:47.040
that he could do some really
trivial things and become

00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:48.790
famous for them.

00:23:48.790 --> 00:23:50.990
Just like Kraft that we were
talking about before.

00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:54.450
But, unlike Kraft, Lagrange
really did a lot of other very

00:23:54.450 --> 00:23:56.140
important things.

00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:59.870
And what Lagrange said was the
following: Well, suppose I

00:23:59.870 --> 00:24:02.870
want to minimize this sum.

00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:07.160
And I want to have this
constraint added in.

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:11.630
Sort of what I want to do,
then, is to minimize a

00:24:11.630 --> 00:24:14.740
weighted sum of this,
which is what I'm

00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:17.730
interested in, and this.

00:24:17.730 --> 00:24:21.510
In other words, if I minimize
this weighted sum here of

00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:26.160
these two things, I'm going to
wind up with some sort of

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:27.590
value for this.

00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:30.080
And some sort of
value for this.

00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:33.420
By changing lambda, then, which
stands for Lagrange, he

00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:37.530
was also clever in making
himself famous that way, by

00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:40.700
changing lambda, I can change
the balance between how

00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:42.850
important these two
things are.

00:24:42.850 --> 00:24:45.470
And as I change the balance
between how important they

00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:49.280
are, when I change it to just
the right place, I'm going to

00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:54.230
have this constraint here
satisfied with equality.

00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:58.330
So that's the whole idea of
Lagrange minimization.

00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:00.820
So we take this function.

00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:03.440
How do you now minimize a

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:06.010
function of multiple variables?

00:25:06.010 --> 00:25:08.680
Well, again it's a
messy problem.

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:10.570
But the first thing you
can try to do is find

00:25:10.570 --> 00:25:12.250
a stationary point.

00:25:12.250 --> 00:25:15.560
So, let's always do the
easy thing first.

00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:19.260
We take the partial derivative
of this function here, with

00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:20.590
respect to l sub i.

00:25:20.590 --> 00:25:22.940
That's what we're trying
to minimize.

00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:27.060
And what we get is p sub i minus
lambda times the natural

00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:30.690
log of 2, times 2 the
minus l sub i.

00:25:30.690 --> 00:25:34.120
I'm not very good at
differentiation any more, so I

00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:36.810
only differentiate things
which are easy.

00:25:36.810 --> 00:25:38.210
And that's easy.

00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:40.630
I want to find a stationary
point, so I set

00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:41.880
this equal to 0.

00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:46.840
That makes the problem worse,
because now I have a function

00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:49.260
of lambda and also all
of these l sub i's.

00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:54.220
But now I choose l sub i, so
that I satisfy the constraint.

00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:58.750
Namely, I choose lambda to
satisfy this equation here.

00:25:58.750 --> 00:26:02.280
When I choose lambda to satisfy
this equation here,

00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:07.480
what I get is p sub i is equal
to 2 to the minus l i, and

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:11.500
therefore, l sub i is equal
to minus log p sub i.

00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:13.710
In other words, I have
this equation here.

00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:17.870
What happens when I sum
this equation over i?

00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:19.800
Let's look at it.

00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:23.370
We sum this over i.

00:26:23.370 --> 00:26:31.690
The sum of p i over i is 1 minus
lambda times natural log

00:26:31.690 --> 00:26:38.150
of 2 times sum of 2 to
the minus l sub i.

00:26:38.150 --> 00:26:40.210
And I want to make
this equal to 1.

00:26:40.210 --> 00:26:46.350
So what I get is 1 is equal
to this times lambda

00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:47.680
natural log of 2.

00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:53.420
So, I hope that choosing lambda
equal to 1 over natural

00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:55.630
log of 2 is what I want to do.

00:26:55.630 --> 00:26:58.830
And when I do that, this
becomes 1 here.

00:26:58.830 --> 00:27:03.150
And I just have 2 to the minus
lambda i is equal to 1.

00:27:03.150 --> 00:27:04.790
OK, good.

00:27:04.790 --> 00:27:10.020
And then, going back to this
equation, p sub i is equal to

00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:12.640
2 to the minus l sub i.

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:14.920
OK, this is this arithmetic.

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:18.400
I mean, if you don't follow what
I'm doing, just look at

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:24.080
it later and you'll find that
there's nothing really there.

00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:27.140
So we wind up with these lengths
being equal to the

00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:30.570
negative of the binary
logarithms of these

00:27:30.570 --> 00:27:33.390
probabilities.

00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:34.660
It's only a stationary point.

00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:36.980
We don't know whether
it's a minimum yet.

00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:39.330
And, unfortunately, we also
have the problem of, they

00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:43.020
might not be integers.

00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:46.890
But, anyway, what we wind up
with, then, if we ignore

00:27:46.890 --> 00:27:50.800
looking at these problems for
the time being, is that the

00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:53.150
lengths are going to
be equal to this.

00:27:53.150 --> 00:27:55.960
The expected value of the
lengths is then going to be

00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:59.990
equal to the sum, over i, of
minus p sub i times the

00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:03.480
logarithm of p sub i.

00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:08.280
When Shannon saw this, and when
various other people saw

00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:11.080
it, they said, gee, this looks
like the entropy of

00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:12.680
statistical mechanics.

00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:16.260
So let's call this
quantity entropy.

00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:18.980
For no better reason
than that.

00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:21.470
And it would probably have been
far better if they called

00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:23.060
it something else.

00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:27.050
Because for years, there were
physicists and philosophers

00:28:27.050 --> 00:28:31.090
trying to figure out what the
deep relationship was between

00:28:31.090 --> 00:28:33.570
statistical mechanical
entropy and

00:28:33.570 --> 00:28:36.360
information theoretic entropy.

00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:39.240
And there probably is such
a relationship, but the

00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:42.630
relationship is far more
complicated than understanding

00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:43.900
information theory.

00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:45.700
And it's far more
complicated than

00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:47.720
understanding statistical mechanics.

00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:52.100
So I advise you to not worry
about that one until after you

00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:56.480
understand what it means in an
information theoretic sense.

00:28:56.480 --> 00:29:00.110
So h of x is what we call
the entropy of the

00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:03.520
random variable x.

00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:06.590
And it really is the entropy
associated with these

00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:08.310
logarithms of p sub i.

00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:16.120
So when you take functions of
a random variable, a random

00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:18.870
variable carries along a
lot of baggage with it.

00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:21.730
Including the probabilities
of everything.

00:29:21.730 --> 00:29:26.640
And when you take the expected
value of a random variable,

00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:29.910
the individual values of the
sample points of that random

00:29:29.910 --> 00:29:31.100
variable are important.

00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:33.290
And the probabilities
are important.

00:29:33.290 --> 00:29:35.410
Here we have something
even stranger.

00:29:35.410 --> 00:29:37.500
Because it's only the
probabilities that have

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:39.110
anything to do with it.

00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:40.080
And this makes sense.

00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:44.050
We already said that these
symbols have nothing to do

00:29:44.050 --> 00:29:45.600
with this problem we're
dealing with.

00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:47.040
You can call the symbols
whatever you

00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:48.230
want to call them.

00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:51.340
And, therefore, the only thing
of any interest to us is these

00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:53.710
probabilities that we're
dealing with.

00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:57.760
So H of x is a function only
of these probabilities.

00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:00.900
It's the expected value
of minus log p sub i.

00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:05.000
This is called entropy, and in
fact we will find out very

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:09.010
shortly that it really is the
minimum number of bits per

00:30:09.010 --> 00:30:13.020
source symbol needed to
represent the source.

00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:16.170
In other words, when we
generalize the problem from

00:30:16.170 --> 00:30:22.210
just plain ordinary
garden-variety oh prefix-free

00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:27.330
codes, we will find that this
number is really what

00:30:27.330 --> 00:30:30.170
characterizes the whole
problem for discrete

00:30:30.170 --> 00:30:31.310
memory-less sources.

00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:34.160
So let's go on and say
more about that.

00:30:37.670 --> 00:30:42.090
Let's say something about
bounds on the entropy.

00:30:42.090 --> 00:30:46.450
First, what's the relationship
between the entropy and this

00:30:46.450 --> 00:30:53.590
minimum of the expected length
that we started to talk about?

00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:58.080
And I claim that H of x is less
than or equal to L min,

00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:01.730
which is less than the
entropy plus 1.

00:31:01.730 --> 00:31:02.590
And why is that?

00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:04.590
We already have the machinery
to see this.

00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:08.130
We almost have the machinery
to see this.

00:31:08.130 --> 00:31:12.130
Namely, we have solved this
minimization problem.

00:31:12.130 --> 00:31:15.580
We've only found a stationary
point, but we've ignored the

00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:19.070
fact that we have an
integer constraint.

00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:25.760
So, if you allow me to say for
the time being that, in fact,

00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:29.930
when we solve the problem
without worrying about

00:31:29.930 --> 00:31:32.760
integers, that it actually gives
me a minimum, then in

00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:34.700
fact this follows very easily.

00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:38.160
Because what I'm going to do
is to find those optimal

00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:40.980
lengths, which are
non-integers.

00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:44.410
And then I can solve the prefix
condition and get a

00:31:44.410 --> 00:31:49.510
code by simply increasing each
of those numbers to the next

00:31:49.510 --> 00:31:50.310
integer up.

00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:53.310
In other words, I can take the
ceiling function of each of

00:31:53.310 --> 00:31:55.780
those real numbers to
get an integer.

00:31:55.780 --> 00:31:59.040
When I take the ceiling
function, 2 to the minus l sub

00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:01.100
i is going to go down.

00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:04.340
So the craft inequality
is still satisfied.

00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:10.240
So the entropy has to be less
than or equal to this average.

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:14.320
Has to be less than
H of x plus 1.

00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:21.890
So the average is equal to H of
x if and only if each these

00:32:21.890 --> 00:32:25.840
probabilities it an integer
power of 2 to start with.

00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:28.720
In other words, the solution I
came up with before is that

00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:32.360
the length I wanted should be
equal to minus the logarithm

00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:35.430
to base 2, of p sub i.

00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:43.380
So if p sub i is already a power
of 2 then I'm home free.

00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:47.165
Because I just pick that length
to be minus log of p

00:32:47.165 --> 00:32:49.640
sub i, and it happens
to be an integer.

00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:51.100
And I don't have
to round it up.

00:32:53.620 --> 00:32:57.460
So if I let l1 to lM be these
codeword lengths -- well,

00:32:57.460 --> 00:32:59.150
here's where I'm going
to prove this to you.

00:33:01.650 --> 00:33:06.020
And the proof is the following:
I want to prove

00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:10.220
that H of x is less than or
equal to l min, which I'll

00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:12.690
just call here L bar.

00:33:12.690 --> 00:33:17.810
So H of x minus L bar is equal
to, this is the entropy.

00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:23.420
This is the expected
length here.

00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:29.270
I can rewrite this as the sum of
p sub i times logarithm of

00:33:29.270 --> 00:33:33.600
2 to the minus l sub i
divided by p sub i.

00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:35.160
That's just arithmetic.

00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:40.700
l sub i is equal to to logarithm
of 2 to the l sub i,

00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:43.080
that's equal to minus
the logarithm of 2

00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:45.000
the minus l sub i.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.160
So I get this.

00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:49.550
There's an inequality.

00:33:49.550 --> 00:33:52.420
Hate to call it an inequality,
it's so trivial.

00:33:57.620 --> 00:34:00.040
Here's the point 1.

00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:07.910
If you plot a natural
log of x.

00:34:07.910 --> 00:34:14.640
And if you compare it with the
function x minus 1, you can

00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:20.570
see that natural log of
x is less than or

00:34:20.570 --> 00:34:24.270
equal to x minus 1.

00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:27.200
Now, this an inequality which
happens to be very useful in

00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:29.380
information theory.

00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:31.905
I would claim that any
inequality that you can prove

00:34:31.905 --> 00:34:35.370
in information theory, by any
means at all, I can prove

00:34:35.370 --> 00:34:39.240
using this inequality
and nothing else.

00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:41.890
And I've believed that for
50 years and nobody's

00:34:41.890 --> 00:34:43.140
proven me wrong yet.

00:34:47.140 --> 00:34:50.800
And also, this is something
you can draw and remember.

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:52.710
So it's simple.

00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:58.260
So the idea, then, is since this
sum log of 2 to the minus

00:34:58.260 --> 00:35:03.990
l over p sub i is less than or
equal to the natural log of 2

00:35:03.990 --> 00:35:07.320
times the natural logarithm
of this.

00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:11.930
You just, here we go.

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:18.030
For any u greater than 0,
natural log of u is less than

00:35:18.030 --> 00:35:19.410
or equal to this.

00:35:19.410 --> 00:35:23.600
So the logarithm to the base 2
of u is less than or equal to

00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:27.630
the logarithm to the base 2 of
e, which is some number,

00:35:27.630 --> 00:35:29.440
times u minus 1.

00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:31.860
With equality at u equals 1.

00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:34.870
So this is less than
or equal to this.

00:35:34.870 --> 00:35:36.010
And look how nice that is.

00:35:36.010 --> 00:35:40.330
The p sub i's cancel out and you
get the sum over i, of 2

00:35:40.330 --> 00:35:45.900
the minus l i minus p sub i is
less than or equal to 0.

00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:50.790
An equality occurs if, and only
if, p sub i is equal to 2

00:35:50.790 --> 00:35:52.160
to the minus l i.

00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:52.590
OK?

00:35:52.590 --> 00:35:56.650
So that's all there is to it.

00:35:56.650 --> 00:36:04.760
And that establishes that --
well, establishes part of this

00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:05.660
theorem here.

00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:10.040
And the other part we already
established, And if you don't

00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:14.040
believe me, the notes do
it more carefully.

00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:18.490
Well, this left us a serious
problem unknown.

00:36:18.490 --> 00:36:21.330
Which is, how do you actually
solve this integer

00:36:21.330 --> 00:36:23.010
minimization problem.

00:36:23.010 --> 00:36:25.810
How do you solve it if you have
a big, long, complicated

00:36:25.810 --> 00:36:28.600
source with lots of
probabilities in it?

00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:30.780
And everybody thought
it was hopeless.

00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:32.970
Even Shannon thought
it was hopeless.

00:36:32.970 --> 00:36:35.410
And Shannon sort of figured
out ways to

00:36:35.410 --> 00:36:36.470
approach this problem.

00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:39.330
He said, well, you want
to have about half the

00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:40.320
probability.

00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:42.630
Starting with 1, about
half the probability

00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:44.110
starting with 0.

00:36:44.110 --> 00:36:50.360
So he would divide up the
symbols in the alphabet, so he

00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:53.330
could come as close is possible
to half of them being

00:36:53.330 --> 00:36:56.380
up here and half of them
coming down here.

00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:58.910
And he would continue to do
that, I mean, I don't usually

00:36:58.910 --> 00:37:02.640
like to write on the blackboard,
but he would start

00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:06.280
out generating a
code like this.

00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:09.640
And this would be approximately
1/2.

00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:12.390
This is approximately 1/2.

00:37:12.390 --> 00:37:15.370
And then he would take
these symbols.

00:37:15.370 --> 00:37:18.090
Split them, again,
in probability.

00:37:18.090 --> 00:37:21.400
And everybody was starting the
problem over here, and trying

00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:25.090
to generate a code working
their way out.

00:37:25.090 --> 00:37:30.170
Well, Dave Huffman was a
graduate student at the time.

00:37:30.170 --> 00:37:34.810
and he took Bob Fano's graduate
course in information

00:37:34.810 --> 00:37:40.150
theory, I think a year or
so later than Kraft did.

00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:44.220
And Bob Fano assigned as a
homework problem, how do you

00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:46.120
solve this problem?

00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:48.530
Sneaky guy.

00:37:48.530 --> 00:37:52.200
And he was very amazed when Dave
Hoffman came in next day

00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:55.300
and said, oh, it's easy,
you do it this way.

00:37:55.300 --> 00:37:58.310
So the question is,
how did he do it?

00:37:58.310 --> 00:38:03.100
Well, Huffman, instead of
looking at the problem from

00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:07.920
here out, looked at the
problem from here in.

00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:09.170
He was --

00:38:09.170 --> 00:38:10.760
I mean, this was before
there was anything

00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:12.680
called computer science.

00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:15.090
But he thought like a computer
scientist did.

00:38:15.090 --> 00:38:18.120
In other words, he thought
algorithmically.

00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:21.800
And he also thought in terms
of discrete problems.

00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:24.140
And therefore, he looked for
properties that these optimum

00:38:24.140 --> 00:38:25.850
codes should have.

00:38:25.850 --> 00:38:27.510
And it was neat.

00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:30.080
So, he started out
with a limit.

00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:33.830
He said, an optimal code has to
have the property that a p

00:38:33.830 --> 00:38:36.330
i is greater than p sub j.

00:38:36.330 --> 00:38:41.090
Then the optimal length
associated with p sub i,

00:38:41.090 --> 00:38:45.090
namely the optimal length of the
i'th codeword, had to be

00:38:45.090 --> 00:38:49.990
less than or equal to the length
of the j'th codeword.

00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:52.700
And you can see this
by saying, well,

00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:54.650
suppose that's not true.

00:38:54.650 --> 00:38:57.560
Suppose that p i is
greater than p j.

00:38:57.560 --> 00:39:01.890
And also, li is greater
than lj.

00:39:01.890 --> 00:39:05.490
And then you say, OK,
take this situation.

00:39:05.490 --> 00:39:09.740
We will interchange those two
codewords in the code.

00:39:09.740 --> 00:39:12.190
And we'll look at what that
does to the average.

00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:15.880
And if you work that through,
you find out that since what

00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:19.590
you've done is, you've shortened
the codeword

00:39:19.590 --> 00:39:22.620
associated with this and
lengthened the codeword

00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:24.720
associated with this.

00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:28.930
You have changed the average
length to make it smaller.

00:39:28.930 --> 00:39:30.970
Now, let me warn you
about something.

00:39:30.970 --> 00:39:34.850
When you start looking at these
properties, the most

00:39:34.850 --> 00:39:38.820
confusing thing is what happens
when two probabilities

00:39:38.820 --> 00:39:42.480
are the same, or when two
lengths are the same.

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:45.830
And I would advise you to just
ignore that problem, until you

00:39:45.830 --> 00:39:47.430
get an idea of what's
going on.

00:39:47.430 --> 00:39:49.650
Namely, assume that all
lengths are different.

00:39:49.650 --> 00:39:51.960
All probabilities
are different.

00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:54.020
And then it's easy to
see what's going on.

00:39:54.020 --> 00:39:56.740
And when you get all done, go
back and straighten out the

00:39:56.740 --> 00:39:59.230
cases where things are equal.

00:39:59.230 --> 00:40:03.620
And I think the notes
do this carefully.

00:40:03.620 --> 00:40:06.530
If you read books on information
theory, about half

00:40:06.530 --> 00:40:09.910
of them do it carefully, and
about half of them don't.

00:40:09.910 --> 00:40:12.570
So you should be suspicious.

00:40:12.570 --> 00:40:16.240
But anyway, that's one of those
trivialities that you

00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:18.830
just have to sort out
for yourself.

00:40:18.830 --> 00:40:19.120
OK.

00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:23.190
The next lemma is optimal
prefix-free codes are full.

00:40:23.190 --> 00:40:25.150
We talked about what
a full code is.

00:40:25.150 --> 00:40:29.370
When you draw this binary graph
for it, you don't have

00:40:29.370 --> 00:40:32.320
any nodes in a binary graph --

00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:33.780
you don't have any leaves
that are not

00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:35.740
associated with codewords.

00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:39.450
Because if you do, we showed
you that shortened the

00:40:39.450 --> 00:40:41.820
codeword of the part of
the tree on the other

00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:43.080
side of that leaf.

00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:46.040
In other words, if you have
something here, if this is a

00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:49.620
codeword and this is not a
codeword, then you just get

00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:51.690
rid of this, and bring
that back here.

00:40:51.690 --> 00:40:54.310
But this is a whole tree
stemming off here, you do the

00:40:54.310 --> 00:40:54.970
same thing.

00:40:54.970 --> 00:40:57.990
You take this whole tree and you
bring it into there, and

00:40:57.990 --> 00:41:00.560
you throw this away.

00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:05.540
So, optimal prefix-free
codes are full.

00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:07.020
So far there's nothing
to this.

00:41:10.310 --> 00:41:13.630
The next part of it is the
sibling of a codeword.

00:41:13.630 --> 00:41:16.250
And what's a sibling?

00:41:16.250 --> 00:41:18.660
Well, we used to call
it a brother.

00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:21.550
But then couldn't do that
because we have to call it a

00:41:21.550 --> 00:41:22.920
brother or sister.

00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:24.840
And that got to difficult.

00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:27.620
So people invented the word
sibling, to talk about a

00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:29.820
brother or a sister.

00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:33.350
So the sibling of a codeword
for is the string form by

00:41:33.350 --> 00:41:34.910
changing the last bit.

00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:37.410
In other words, in this
family tree here, the

00:41:37.410 --> 00:41:38.980
sibling of this is this.

00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:41.300
The sibling of this is this.

00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:43.890
The sibling of this is this.

00:41:43.890 --> 00:41:49.690
So, a leaf can have a sibling
which is an intermediate node,

00:41:49.690 --> 00:41:50.940
and vice versa.

00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:58.100
So then he said, the sibling
of a codeword is a string

00:41:58.100 --> 00:42:00.930
formed by changing
the last bit.

00:42:00.930 --> 00:42:04.720
I think he probably said the
brother, but, anyway.

00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:09.650
For optimality, the sibling of
each maximum length codeword

00:42:09.650 --> 00:42:12.200
is another codeword.

00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:14.520
Now, that's a really
simple one.

00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:17.790
If I make this a codeword, and
this is the maximal length

00:42:17.790 --> 00:42:22.380
codeword in this code I'm
talking about, this can't be

00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:24.640
an intermediate node because
then there would have to be

00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:27.240
longer codewords.

00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:30.030
And it can't be empty because
these optimal

00:42:30.030 --> 00:42:31.720
codes are all full.

00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:34.530
And therefore, this has
to have a sibling

00:42:34.530 --> 00:42:36.800
which is also a codeword.

00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:43.970
So the longest codewords
have to have siblings.

00:42:43.970 --> 00:42:46.960
Well, that's easy enough.

00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:50.435
Incidentally, one of the
problems that you have in

00:42:50.435 --> 00:42:53.250
proving this sort of thing is,
what happens if you have

00:42:53.250 --> 00:42:56.350
zero-probability letters.

00:42:56.350 --> 00:42:59.200
Well, we just get rid of that
problem and say, well, there

00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:01.860
aren't any zero-probability
letters.

00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:04.760
Because if we want to come up
with a sensible model for

00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:07.850
something, we're not going
to create a codeword for

00:43:07.850 --> 00:43:09.490
something that can't happen.

00:43:09.490 --> 00:43:13.630
So, there are no
zero-probability letters in

00:43:13.630 --> 00:43:15.620
this alphabet.

00:43:15.620 --> 00:43:17.810
I mean, if you want to put them
in, it just complicates

00:43:17.810 --> 00:43:19.290
the whole thing.

00:43:19.290 --> 00:43:20.540
And you can do it.

00:43:23.910 --> 00:43:26.730
Then, finally, there's this
lemma which says, there is an

00:43:26.730 --> 00:43:31.910
optimal prefix-free code in
which, after you order the

00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:37.250
probabilities of all of the
messages, namely you order p1

00:43:37.250 --> 00:43:40.000
to be greater than or equal
to p2, greater than or

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:40.880
equal to p sub m.

00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:45.380
In other words, we just rename
the letters in the alphabet,

00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:49.780
so that letter m is less likely
than letter m minus 1,

00:43:49.780 --> 00:43:50.760
and so forth.

00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:51.480
Back to 1.

00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:55.560
1 is the most probable,
m is the least likely.

00:43:55.560 --> 00:43:58.010
Well, we've already concluded
that we want to assign the

00:43:58.010 --> 00:44:02.910
longest messages to the least
probable codewords.

00:44:02.910 --> 00:44:06.860
And this says, take the two
least probable codewords and

00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:09.400
we can always make an optimal
code in which those two

00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:11.660
codewords are siblings.

00:44:11.660 --> 00:44:14.280
And the reason for that is, one
of them is not going to be

00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:19.180
longer than the other or else
you can shorten the code by

00:44:19.180 --> 00:44:21.110
interchanging things.

00:44:21.110 --> 00:44:24.640
So there is an optimal
prefix-free code in which the

00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:27.520
codeword for m minus 1.

00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:29.370
And the codeword for
m are maximal

00:44:29.370 --> 00:44:33.640
length and they're siblings.

00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:37.360
So the Huffman algorithm first
combines these two.

00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:41.100
And then looks at the reduced
tree with m minus 1 nodes.

00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:42.900
Let me show you an
example of that.

00:44:46.700 --> 00:44:47.990
So it starts out.

00:44:47.990 --> 00:44:50.570
Here, I've ordered the
probabilities associated with

00:44:50.570 --> 00:44:51.410
a set of symbols.

00:44:51.410 --> 00:44:54.700
The symbols are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:44:54.700 --> 00:45:00.310
The two least likely messages
are 0.1 and 0.15.

00:45:00.310 --> 00:45:02.260
Obviously, I could've
interchanged these

00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:03.330
two if I want to.

00:45:03.330 --> 00:45:06.340
But why interchange them?

00:45:06.340 --> 00:45:11.270
So I say, OK, the last digit
on this one, I'm going to

00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:13.050
assign to be a 0.

00:45:13.050 --> 00:45:16.920
The last digit on this, I'm
going to assign to be a 1.

00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:19.000
And the important thing is,
I'm going to make them

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:20.700
siblings in this tree.

00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:24.740
And what I'm going to do now,
terribly complicated thing,

00:45:24.740 --> 00:45:27.890
instead of building a tree from
left to right, I'm going

00:45:27.890 --> 00:45:30.500
to build a tree from
right to left.

00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:32.850
So when I get all done with
the tree it's going to

00:45:32.850 --> 00:45:34.250
come in like this.

00:45:34.250 --> 00:45:38.560
And what I'm doing is starting
out at the end, to start to

00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:40.760
build the end of the tree.

00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:44.610
And what happens after I go
through this first step is, I

00:45:44.610 --> 00:45:47.280
say, OK there is an
optimal code.

00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:50.420
In which these two
quantities are

00:45:50.420 --> 00:45:52.950
siblings of maximal length.

00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:55.740
I now want to form an optimal
code for these

00:45:55.740 --> 00:45:58.640
probabilities here.

00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:01.140
So, I go back and
I iterate again.

00:46:01.140 --> 00:46:04.590
And I said, OK, if I have these
probabilities here,

00:46:04.590 --> 00:46:07.150
what's the optimal code.

00:46:07.150 --> 00:46:08.830
Well, I could reorder
the things.

00:46:08.830 --> 00:46:11.400
But now I know that the only
thing I'm interested in is the

00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:16.690
two least likely symbols in
this new alphabet here.

00:46:16.690 --> 00:46:19.360
Which is 0.2 and 0.15.

00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:21.300
So I combine those together.

00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:24.610
I tie them together as
siblings in this last

00:46:24.610 --> 00:46:28.000
generation, however
it works out.

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:31.450
So then I have an alphabet
of size three.

00:46:31.450 --> 00:46:32.990
And then down here,
I have these

00:46:32.990 --> 00:46:34.550
two things tied together.

00:46:34.550 --> 00:46:36.730
These two things
tied together.

00:46:36.730 --> 00:46:41.200
So I have a node of
probability 0.25.

00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:45.200
I have a node of probability
0.35, and I have a node of

00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:46.870
probability 0.4.

00:46:46.870 --> 00:46:51.310
I take the two least likely,
and I tie them together.

00:46:51.310 --> 00:46:54.120
And then I have two nodes left,
one with probability 0.6

00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:56.480
and one with probability 0.4.

00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:58.010
And I tie them together.

00:46:58.010 --> 00:47:01.760
And, presto, I have my whole
code, except for flipping it

00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:04.240
over, to go from left to
right if you like.

00:47:04.240 --> 00:47:05.960
Codes that go from
left and right,

00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:07.220
instead of right to left.

00:47:11.780 --> 00:47:12.190
OK.

00:47:12.190 --> 00:47:13.050
I have swindled you.

00:47:13.050 --> 00:47:14.790
How have I swindled you?

00:47:18.150 --> 00:47:20.680
I mean, I've swindled you a
little bit by talking about

00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:23.360
these things that might
be equal or not equal.

00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:24.350
And that's not important.

00:47:24.350 --> 00:47:26.380
You can sort that
out on your own.

00:47:26.380 --> 00:47:29.200
There's a very important
swindle I pulled.

00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:30.450
And what's that?

00:47:42.260 --> 00:47:46.450
What's very incomplete
in this argument?

00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:53.090
This part is fine.

00:47:53.090 --> 00:47:54.850
Nothing wrong here.

00:47:54.850 --> 00:47:58.750
We have a lemma which says, you
can find an optimal code

00:47:58.750 --> 00:48:00.410
by tying these two
things together.

00:48:03.270 --> 00:48:03.560
Yeah?

00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:04.810
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:48:11.085 --> 00:48:14.020
combine those two
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] combination.

00:48:14.020 --> 00:48:15.540
PROFESSOR: You're saying,
how do I know to

00:48:15.540 --> 00:48:17.380
combine these two?

00:48:17.380 --> 00:48:18.640
OK, which means what?

00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:19.585
Yeah.

00:48:19.585 --> 00:48:21.722
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
you've just added the

00:48:21.722 --> 00:48:24.340
probabilities --

00:48:24.340 --> 00:48:26.760
PROFESSOR: I've just added
those two probabilities.

00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:30.190
So I have a new ensemble where
I have four probabilities,

00:48:30.190 --> 00:48:36.350
0.25, 0.15, 0.2, and 0.4.

00:48:36.350 --> 00:48:37.070
And that's fine.

00:48:37.070 --> 00:48:39.250
I still have these things.

00:48:39.250 --> 00:48:41.450
No, there's no independence
involved here at all.

00:48:41.450 --> 00:48:46.140
I mean, I started out
with five letters.

00:48:46.140 --> 00:48:48.150
Which are disjoined.

00:48:48.150 --> 00:48:50.100
I now have four letters
that are disjoined.

00:48:56.200 --> 00:48:57.930
What have I done?

00:48:57.930 --> 00:48:58.160
Yeah.

00:48:58.160 --> 00:48:59.410
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:49:03.490 --> 00:49:05.200
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:05.510
Yeah.

00:49:05.510 --> 00:49:11.610
I have assumed, now, that once I
get these four symbols, if I

00:49:11.610 --> 00:49:15.910
have those four symbols, I can
form an optimal code for those

00:49:15.910 --> 00:49:20.720
four symbols in which these two
symbols get tied together.

00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:24.500
But how do I know that an
optimal code for this reduced

00:49:24.500 --> 00:49:27.980
set of probabilities is also
an optimal code for the

00:49:27.980 --> 00:49:29.230
original problem?

00:49:34.940 --> 00:49:37.910
I have tied these two
things together.

00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:40.870
I know there's an optimal code
in which these two things are

00:49:40.870 --> 00:49:42.480
tied together.

00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:44.760
I then have four symbols.

00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:47.990
I want to find a code for
those four symbols.

00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:51.950
But I assume that the optimal
code for these four symbols,

00:49:51.950 --> 00:49:55.000
when I break apart these two
things, gives me an optimal

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:58.430
code for five symbols.

00:49:58.430 --> 00:50:01.090
That's the sort of thing I
want you people to start

00:50:01.090 --> 00:50:02.620
catching onto immediately.

00:50:02.620 --> 00:50:07.520
I want you to start asking
those nasty questions.

00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:11.840
And those nasty questions are
the things that say, OK, how

00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:15.290
do I know that this works?

00:50:15.290 --> 00:50:17.090
In other words, you're not
here to learn these

00:50:17.090 --> 00:50:18.100
algorithms.

00:50:18.100 --> 00:50:21.160
I can tell you what the
algorithm is in an instant.

00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:23.440
You can do the algorithm.

00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:26.790
A computer can do the algorithm
about three thousand

00:50:26.790 --> 00:50:29.290
times faster than you can.

00:50:29.290 --> 00:50:32.260
And you can be replaced by a
computer, if you only learn

00:50:32.260 --> 00:50:34.440
the algorithms.

00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:37.190
You can program the algorithm.

00:50:37.190 --> 00:50:40.100
You can probably find the
computer that can program the

00:50:40.100 --> 00:50:42.130
algorithm too.

00:50:42.130 --> 00:50:45.370
And there's no need to program
it more than once.

00:50:45.370 --> 00:50:50.530
So that after you've done that,
you are useless again.

00:50:50.530 --> 00:50:53.030
So the only thing that's
worthwhile for you is to be

00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:55.910
able to spot these problems
and to understand

00:50:55.910 --> 00:50:58.590
what's going on.

00:50:58.590 --> 00:50:59.810
So.

00:50:59.810 --> 00:51:04.050
How do I know that this first
optimization leads to the

00:51:04.050 --> 00:51:07.200
second optimization.

00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:10.080
After combining these two least
likely codewords, or

00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:15.110
siblings, we've gotten a reduced
set of probabilities.

00:51:15.110 --> 00:51:19.040
In this problem here, what we've
done, the reduced set of

00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:27.770
probabilities are 0.4,
0.2, 0.15, and 0.25.

00:51:27.770 --> 00:51:32.000
Why does finding the optimal
code for this reduced set

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:35.680
result in an optimal code
for the original set?

00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:39.000
That's really the question
that we're asking.

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:43.240
Well, it's not hard.

00:51:43.240 --> 00:51:47.450
If you take any code for the
reduced set, let's call the

00:51:47.450 --> 00:51:51.410
reduced set x prime, set
of probabilities.

00:51:51.410 --> 00:51:55.160
Let the expected length
of that be l prime.

00:51:55.160 --> 00:51:58.450
It's not necessarily an optimal
code, but it's any old

00:51:58.450 --> 00:52:00.040
code that I generate.

00:52:00.040 --> 00:52:04.600
Any old code I generate for L
prime, I can now take that

00:52:04.600 --> 00:52:12.360
code for l prime and I can
expand it out to a code for L.

00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:18.070
Namely, I have this code here
this, this, this, and that's

00:52:18.070 --> 00:52:19.920
the expanded --

00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:23.620
and now I can expand it into a
code for the original set, by

00:52:23.620 --> 00:52:28.180
adding on this and this,
as leaves on this.

00:52:28.180 --> 00:52:31.100
This leaf here then becomes
an intermediate node.

00:52:31.100 --> 00:52:34.980
And I add two extra
leaves to it.

00:52:34.980 --> 00:52:37.130
OK, well, it's not hard.

00:52:37.130 --> 00:52:45.060
The expected length for this
code, for these five letters,

00:52:45.060 --> 00:52:48.340
I claim, is equal to the
expected length for this

00:52:48.340 --> 00:52:52.210
reduced code, this, this,
this, and this.

00:52:52.210 --> 00:52:55.160
Plus one extra digit for this.

00:52:55.160 --> 00:52:58.650
Plus one extra digit for this.

00:52:58.650 --> 00:53:02.310
So the expected length for L is
the expected length for L

00:53:02.310 --> 00:53:08.970
prime plus 0.15 plus 0.1.

00:53:08.970 --> 00:53:19.310
Which says the following: if I
want to minimize this, and I

00:53:19.310 --> 00:53:23.070
know that this has to be equal
to this, and these two numbers

00:53:23.070 --> 00:53:25.440
are fixed, I can't
change them.

00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:29.770
I can minimize this,
by minimizing this.

00:53:29.770 --> 00:53:31.610
And that's the final step
in the whole argument.

00:53:35.060 --> 00:53:37.170
And what's peculiar
is that everybody

00:53:37.170 --> 00:53:39.720
learns the Huffman algorithm.

00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:43.980
And what Huffman did, which was
really very smart, was to

00:53:43.980 --> 00:53:45.230
sort out this issue.

00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:50.860
And I can teach this to a
hundred classes, and nobody

00:53:50.860 --> 00:53:54.100
will ever point out to me that
there's a logical flaw in the

00:53:54.100 --> 00:53:56.320
whole argument.

00:53:56.320 --> 00:53:58.770
And you can look at most books
on information theory and they

00:53:58.770 --> 00:54:00.660
never point out that
there's that

00:54:00.660 --> 00:54:03.120
logical flaw there, either.

00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:09.740
So, anyway, that's the end
of Huffman's algorithm.

00:54:09.740 --> 00:54:11.960
You can see when you look at
this that this is really an

00:54:11.960 --> 00:54:14.730
extraordinarily easy
thing to do.

00:54:14.730 --> 00:54:16.530
I mean, you can take
an alphabet of

00:54:16.530 --> 00:54:18.760
several thousand symbols.

00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:20.870
All you have to do
is order them.

00:54:20.870 --> 00:54:23.290
Tie the least two
likely together.

00:54:23.290 --> 00:54:25.840
Assign a 1 and a 0 to them.

00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:30.350
Then, stick that into an
ordered list again.

00:54:30.350 --> 00:54:31.720
Take the two least probable.

00:54:31.720 --> 00:54:32.910
Tie them together.

00:54:32.910 --> 00:54:35.170
Stick it into an ordered
list again.

00:54:35.170 --> 00:54:40.050
And, if you have some minimal
knowledge of data structures,

00:54:40.050 --> 00:54:42.280
you can do this with essentially
on the order of

00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:46.440
one operation for each letter
in this alphabet.

00:54:46.440 --> 00:54:48.890
So it really isn't a
very difficult sum.

00:54:48.890 --> 00:54:53.240
So here's an integer problem
which is really easy to solve.

00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:55.880
And the way to solve it is to
look at the problem in the

00:54:55.880 --> 00:54:58.160
opposite way from what
everybody else has

00:54:58.160 --> 00:55:00.570
looked at it in.

00:55:00.570 --> 00:55:03.190
Does this say you want to
ignore everything that

00:55:03.190 --> 00:55:05.670
everybody else has done,
and go your own way?

00:55:05.670 --> 00:55:07.470
Not quite.

00:55:07.470 --> 00:55:10.440
But it says that's one of the
things you ought to try, if

00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:13.560
you find that everybody is doing
something one way and

00:55:13.560 --> 00:55:19.250
you can find another way to
look at, that's very rich.

00:55:19.250 --> 00:55:21.880
It might turn out to be nothing
but it might turn out

00:55:21.880 --> 00:55:24.610
to be something very
worthwhile.

00:55:31.380 --> 00:55:36.870
Let's now talk about this
quantity, entropy.

00:55:36.870 --> 00:55:45.560
And for every chance variable,
x, if that chance variable, x,

00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:51.610
is discrete and has a finite
number of elements in it, so

00:55:51.610 --> 00:55:56.490
I'm talking about a chance
variable x, what's a chance

00:55:56.490 --> 00:56:00.660
variable have tagging
along after it?

00:56:00.660 --> 00:56:02.190
It has a set of n probabilities

00:56:02.190 --> 00:56:04.690
tagging along after it.

00:56:04.690 --> 00:56:06.360
That's what a chance
variable is.

00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:08.620
A chance variable is not
just the alphabet.

00:56:08.620 --> 00:56:11.040
A chance variable is the
alphabet plus the

00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:12.250
probabilities.

00:56:12.250 --> 00:56:16.200
That's why you then talk about
it having an entropy.

00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:20.020
And the entropy is the expected
value of, minus the

00:56:20.020 --> 00:56:22.760
logarithm, of this
PMF function.

00:56:26.310 --> 00:56:30.340
So, in fact, this is an unusual
statistic in the sense

00:56:30.340 --> 00:56:34.400
that it has nothing to do with
the symbol values, and

00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:37.090
everything to do with just
the probabilities

00:56:37.090 --> 00:56:39.580
of the symbol values.

00:56:39.580 --> 00:56:42.750
And as we go on, you'll see that
in fact this is a very

00:56:42.750 --> 00:56:44.680
important property of it.

00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:47.280
And dealing with the logarithms
of these symbol

00:56:47.280 --> 00:56:53.400
values is, in fact, a much more
worthwhile thing to do

00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:57.250
than dealing with the
probabilities of the symbols.

00:56:57.250 --> 00:57:02.550
Now, let me pause again and see
if anybody can have any

00:57:02.550 --> 00:57:07.290
idea of why logarithms of
probabilities might be more

00:57:07.290 --> 00:57:10.990
significant than
probabilities.

00:57:10.990 --> 00:57:13.410
And think of what we're going
to be doing here.

00:57:13.410 --> 00:57:17.490
We're taking a sequence
of letters.

00:57:17.490 --> 00:57:19.990
When I take a sequence of
letters, what's the

00:57:19.990 --> 00:57:22.210
probability of the sequence
of letters?

00:57:24.820 --> 00:57:25.760
If they're IID.

00:57:25.760 --> 00:57:27.460
Namely, we're looking --

00:57:27.460 --> 00:57:28.790
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:57:28.790 --> 00:57:32.310
PROFESSOR: It's the product
of those probabilities.

00:57:32.310 --> 00:57:39.070
Now, if you agree with me that
the probability theory is

00:57:39.070 --> 00:57:43.450
concerned 50% with the law of
large numbers and 50% with

00:57:43.450 --> 00:57:47.030
everything else all put
together, why is the logarithm

00:57:47.030 --> 00:57:48.900
of a probability important?

00:57:48.900 --> 00:57:50.150
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:57:55.310 --> 00:57:58.020
PROFESSOR: You change your
product to a sum, yes.

00:57:58.020 --> 00:58:02.140
If you have a product of
probabilities, you can talk

00:58:02.140 --> 00:58:07.650
about a sum of the logarithms
of probabilities.

00:58:07.650 --> 00:58:12.250
That's why entropy is important

00:58:12.250 --> 00:58:14.340
in statistical mechanics.

00:58:14.340 --> 00:58:18.290
It also is, fundamentally,
the reason why entropy is

00:58:18.290 --> 00:58:20.530
important in information
theory.

00:58:20.530 --> 00:58:24.360
Is because what you're almost
always interested in is a

00:58:24.360 --> 00:58:26.360
product of probabilities.

00:58:26.360 --> 00:58:29.310
And when you're interested in a
product of probabilities and

00:58:29.310 --> 00:58:32.050
you want to use the law of large
numbers, you turn that

00:58:32.050 --> 00:58:35.580
product of probabilities into
a sum of the logarithms of

00:58:35.580 --> 00:58:37.820
probabilities.

00:58:37.820 --> 00:58:39.070
Fundamental idea.

00:58:41.560 --> 00:58:44.710
Shannon took eight years
sorting all this out.

00:58:44.710 --> 00:58:49.970
And Shannon was by far the
smartest person I've ever met.

00:58:49.970 --> 00:58:54.570
I mean, the problems that we
worry about, he just, bip.

00:58:54.570 --> 00:58:57.970
Solves it with no
effort at all.

00:58:57.970 --> 00:59:00.570
This one took them a
while to sort out.

00:59:00.570 --> 00:59:03.030
It also took him a while to sort
out the fact that once he

00:59:03.030 --> 00:59:06.670
sorted this out, he could sort
out all of the other problems.

00:59:06.670 --> 00:59:09.730
As far as communications
was concerned.

00:59:09.730 --> 00:59:13.660
So was quite important.

00:59:13.660 --> 00:59:15.140
I mean, I can tell you
one of the peculiar

00:59:15.140 --> 00:59:17.590
things about Shannon.

00:59:17.590 --> 00:59:20.430
Just from the first time I ever
talked to him about a

00:59:20.430 --> 00:59:22.300
technical problem.

00:59:22.300 --> 00:59:24.860
I'd just become a faculty
member here.

00:59:24.860 --> 00:59:28.790
And his office was about five
doors down from mine.

00:59:28.790 --> 00:59:31.630
And one day I screwed up my
courage to go down and talk to

00:59:31.630 --> 00:59:34.340
the guy about a problem
I was working on.

00:59:34.340 --> 00:59:36.500
And I thought it was a
really neat problem.

00:59:36.500 --> 00:59:39.020
It had all sorts of pieces to
it, all sorts of bells and

00:59:39.020 --> 00:59:40.280
whistles on it.

00:59:40.280 --> 00:59:42.850
And I started to explain
it to him.

00:59:42.850 --> 00:59:45.380
And he said, well, can we look
at a slightly simpler case

00:59:45.380 --> 00:59:49.270
where you throw out this part of
it, you throw out one bell.

00:59:49.270 --> 00:59:50.840
Then he'd throw out a whistle.

00:59:50.840 --> 00:59:52.530
Then he'd throw out a bell.

00:59:52.530 --> 00:59:54.690
And I was going along with
this and saying,

00:59:54.690 --> 00:59:55.690
yeah, I guess we could.

00:59:55.690 --> 00:59:56.770
We could.

00:59:56.770 --> 01:00:00.150
We can throw out all of these
things without really losing

01:00:00.150 --> 01:00:02.380
the essence of the problem.

01:00:02.380 --> 01:00:04.150
And, finally, I started
to get discouraged.

01:00:04.150 --> 01:00:06.890
Because this really neat
research problem, this really

01:00:06.890 --> 01:00:10.680
important research problem,
was turning a toy problem

01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:13.530
which was almost trivial.

01:00:13.530 --> 01:00:17.080
It had nothing to do, it
seemed, with anything.

01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:20.260
And finally we got down
to a certain point.

01:00:20.260 --> 01:00:24.200
And I said, yeah, but this is
trivial, the solution is this.

01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:26.170
And he said, yeah.

01:00:26.170 --> 01:00:29.180
And then we started putting
back all the pieces.

01:00:29.180 --> 01:00:33.270
And his genius was, he knew
which things to throw out.

01:00:33.270 --> 01:00:36.580
So that each of the things we
threw out, we could put them

01:00:36.580 --> 01:00:38.060
back in again.

01:00:38.060 --> 01:00:40.330
When we got done, the research
problem was trivial.

01:00:42.870 --> 01:00:46.450
And his genius was in finding
the right trivial

01:00:46.450 --> 01:00:48.960
example to look at.

01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:52.290
So, in fact, what you always
want to look at, in the

01:00:52.290 --> 01:00:55.980
communications field -- and in
most fields, I think -- is

01:00:55.980 --> 01:00:59.320
finding the really simple way
of looking at something.

01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:03.660
Which means you have to throw
out most of the nonsense.

01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:06.560
So, in this case, it's looking
at entropy, which is the

01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:09.010
logarithm of a probability
assignment.

01:01:09.010 --> 01:01:12.250
And you want to look at that
because the logarithm of a

01:01:12.250 --> 01:01:15.950
probability assignment lets
you add the logarithms of

01:01:15.950 --> 01:01:16.830
probabilities.

01:01:16.830 --> 01:01:18.990
Use the law of large numbers.

01:01:18.990 --> 01:01:25.500
And then you can talk about
sequences of elements.

01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:27.320
Properties of entropy.

01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:32.570
For a discrete random
chance variable.

01:01:32.570 --> 01:01:35.240
We have m elements
in the alphabet.

01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:39.440
First thing is that the entropy
is always greater than

01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:41.570
or equal to 0.

01:01:41.570 --> 01:01:42.920
Why is that?

01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:44.170
I'll let you figure it out.

01:01:46.660 --> 01:01:49.910
Why is the logarithm of a
problem, minus the logarithm

01:01:49.910 --> 01:01:55.270
of a probability, greater
than or equal to 0?

01:01:55.270 --> 01:01:56.520
Why is it non-negative?

01:01:58.810 --> 01:01:59.550
Yeah.

01:01:59.550 --> 01:02:00.870
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

01:02:00.870 --> 01:02:02.330
PROFESSOR: Probabilities
are always less than

01:02:02.330 --> 01:02:04.860
or equal to 1, yes.

01:02:04.860 --> 01:02:07.390
So this quantity here
is always greater

01:02:07.390 --> 01:02:08.550
than or equal to 0.

01:02:08.550 --> 01:02:10.980
Because the logarithm
of 1 is equal to 0.

01:02:15.970 --> 01:02:19.440
We have a quality here if
x is deterministic.

01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:21.590
Which is just a special
case there.

01:02:21.590 --> 01:02:24.880
Where you have an ensemble
of one element and it has

01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:26.830
probability 1.

01:02:26.830 --> 01:02:30.610
Or, in fact, at this point you
could add in things which have

01:02:30.610 --> 01:02:32.750
zero probability.

01:02:32.750 --> 01:02:35.500
Well, that's a little
bit tricky.

01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:38.320
Because you add in something
that's zero probability.

01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:44.640
And the logarithm of
0 is infinity.

01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:48.820
So you're dealing with the
expected value of a bunch of

01:02:48.820 --> 01:02:51.930
infinities, which each occur
with zero probability.

01:02:51.930 --> 01:02:56.330
And you're forced to say, well,
I think that 0 times log

01:02:56.330 --> 01:02:59.270
of 0 is equal to 0.

01:02:59.270 --> 01:03:04.590
And in fact, epsilon times log
of episilon goes to 0 as

01:03:04.590 --> 01:03:06.490
epsilon goes to 0.

01:03:06.490 --> 01:03:09.670
But you save yourself a lot of
worry by just leaving out

01:03:09.670 --> 01:03:13.540
things of zero probability.

01:03:13.540 --> 01:03:16.580
So H of x is greater
than or equal to 0.

01:03:16.580 --> 01:03:19.020
We have equality if x
is deterministic.

01:03:19.020 --> 01:03:24.750
H of x is less than or
equal to log of m.

01:03:24.750 --> 01:03:28.830
The quality, if x
is equiprobable.

01:03:28.830 --> 01:03:30.080
And how do I know that?

01:03:33.030 --> 01:03:35.140
I look at this again.

01:03:35.140 --> 01:03:39.630
I'm not going to prove it here
but, essentially, this follows

01:03:39.630 --> 01:03:45.620
from saying that the natural
logarithm of something is less

01:03:45.620 --> 01:03:48.500
than or equal to that
something minus 1.

01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:52.990
And you take the difference of
the entropy, and log of m.

01:03:52.990 --> 01:03:57.510
And, presto, it gives you the
result that you want.

01:03:57.510 --> 01:04:01.285
So you've got the most entropy,
if everything is

01:04:01.285 --> 01:04:02.535
equiprobable.

01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:09.450
For any code satisfying the
Kraft inequality, the entropy

01:04:09.450 --> 01:04:12.130
is less than or equal
to L bar.

01:04:12.130 --> 01:04:15.930
Well, that's what we
already proved.

01:04:15.930 --> 01:04:20.490
Mainly in the middle of the
lecture, we showed that for

01:04:20.490 --> 01:04:24.370
any code to satisfied the Kraft
inequality, the entropy

01:04:24.370 --> 01:04:27.620
was always less than or equal to
L bar, because the entropy

01:04:27.620 --> 01:04:30.700
is what you get if you minimize
the expected length

01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:32.990
without the integer
constraint.

01:04:32.990 --> 01:04:36.830
And L bar is what you get --
well, L bar min is what you

01:04:36.830 --> 01:04:43.040
get when you minimize it with
the integer constraint.

01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:45.100
I mean, you don't bother
about minimizing it.

01:04:45.100 --> 01:04:47.010
You get something bigger
than L min.

01:04:47.010 --> 01:04:51.320
So this is less than or equal to
the length of any codeword.

01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:55.170
For the very best codeword, for
the very best code, the

01:04:55.170 --> 01:04:59.290
expected value of the minimum
is less than or equal to the

01:04:59.290 --> 01:05:01.190
entropy plus y.

01:05:01.190 --> 01:05:05.010
And you get that just by adding
to each non-integer

01:05:05.010 --> 01:05:09.530
length the ceiling function.

01:05:09.530 --> 01:05:13.770
Which gives you, at most, one
extra digit for each codeword.

01:05:13.770 --> 01:05:16.870
Now, here's the more
interesting one.

01:05:16.870 --> 01:05:22.100
For independent chance
variables, x and y, here's

01:05:22.100 --> 01:05:28.120
where the nice part about
notation comes along.

01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:32.250
What's the entropy of x y?

01:05:32.250 --> 01:05:35.330
Well, what do I mean
by x y first?

01:05:35.330 --> 01:05:38.460
I have a chance variable, x.

01:05:38.460 --> 01:05:45.300
And this chance variable x has
an alphabet associated with

01:05:45.300 --> 01:05:47.800
it. x1 up to x sub m.

01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:49.850
I have a chance variable y.

01:05:49.850 --> 01:05:53.490
It has an alphabet associated
with it.

01:05:53.490 --> 01:05:58.870
What's the sample space, what's
the set of events

01:05:58.870 --> 01:06:02.950
corresponding to the chance
variable x y?

01:06:05.790 --> 01:06:09.990
By x y, I mean a chance variable
whose elements are

01:06:09.990 --> 01:06:14.170
the possible values
of both x and y.

01:06:14.170 --> 01:06:17.740
So, I'm talking about the joint
ensemble of x and y.

01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:21.080
I have a bunch of possible
values for that.

01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:26.260
And those possible values, if
I have m possibilities for

01:06:26.260 --> 01:06:28.940
each, I have m squared
possible values

01:06:28.940 --> 01:06:31.180
for the two of them.

01:06:31.180 --> 01:06:35.050
So I'm talking about the
expected value of minus the

01:06:35.050 --> 01:06:40.750
logarithm of the probability
of x and y.

01:06:40.750 --> 01:06:43.890
In other words, I am trying
to take the --

01:06:43.890 --> 01:06:46.640
let me write it out.

01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:49.840
I'm probably given conniptions
to -- no?

01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:51.090
OK.

01:06:58.930 --> 01:07:06.960
I want to take p of x y of
symbol x y, times minus the

01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:16.440
logarithm to the base 2
of p sub x y of x y.

01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:21.340
That's what this means
if I write it out.

01:07:24.620 --> 01:07:32.740
Well, this probability here is
p sub x of little x, times p

01:07:32.740 --> 01:07:35.280
sub y of little y.

01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:36.490
Why is that?

01:07:36.490 --> 01:07:37.660
Because I'm assuming
that they're

01:07:37.660 --> 01:07:39.630
independent of each other.

01:07:39.630 --> 01:07:42.160
And, therefore, the probability
of two of them is

01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:45.405
the product of the
probabilities, times minus log

01:07:45.405 --> 01:07:46.080
to the base 2.

01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:55.410
So if p sub x of x minus
logarithm to the base 2 of p

01:07:55.410 --> 01:07:58.560
sub y of y.

01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:05.120
And I'm summing this over
all x and all y.

01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:10.440
And the more sophisticated
way to write this --

01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:13.070
things I say in lecture, you
don't have to copy down

01:08:13.070 --> 01:08:16.290
because they're always
in the notes.

01:08:16.290 --> 01:08:17.880
If they're not in the
notes, it's probably

01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:19.130
wrong anyway, so.

01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:25.190
So this expected value is
expected value of the

01:08:25.190 --> 01:08:27.490
logarithm of the probability
of x y.

01:08:27.490 --> 01:08:32.190
Which is the expected value
of the logarithm of p of

01:08:32.190 --> 01:08:34.350
x times p of y.

01:08:34.350 --> 01:08:37.290
And, since I have a logarithm
of a product, that's the

01:08:37.290 --> 01:08:42.350
expected value of minus log p
of x minus log p of y, which

01:08:42.350 --> 01:08:47.370
is the entropy of x plus
the entropy of y.

01:08:47.370 --> 01:08:50.720
In other words, when I have a
joint ensemble of even more

01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:56.660
independent quantities, The
entropy the sequence is equal

01:08:56.660 --> 01:09:01.800
to the sum of the entropies of
the individual elements in

01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:03.050
that sequence.

01:09:07.270 --> 01:09:09.630
Well, that's all I wanted
to talk about today.

01:09:09.630 --> 01:09:12.010
If any of you have any questions
to ask, you should

01:09:12.010 --> 01:09:13.500
ask them now.

01:09:13.500 --> 01:09:17.210
I went through Huffman coding
pretty quickly, because it's

01:09:17.210 --> 01:09:19.670
something where you have
to do some exercises on

01:09:19.670 --> 01:09:21.920
it to sort it out.

01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:24.480
And I didn't want to do
any more than that.
