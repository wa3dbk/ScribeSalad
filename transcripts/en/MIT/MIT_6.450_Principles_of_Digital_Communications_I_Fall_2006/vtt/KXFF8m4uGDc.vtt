00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.225
PROFESSOR: As this says, and
all the handouts say

00:00:24.225 --> 00:00:26.650
that this is 6.450.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.500
It's a first year graduate
course in the principles of

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.930
digital communication.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.870
It's sort of the major first
course that you take as a

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.850
graduate student in the
communication area.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.740
The information theory course
uses this as a prerequisite,

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.050
uses it in a rather
strong way.

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.950
6.432, the stochastic process
course uses it as a

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.080
prerequisite.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.710
6.451, which is the companion
course which follows after

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.600
this uses it as a
prerequisite.

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:07.110
It's sort of material that you
have to know if you're going

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.360
to go into the communication
area.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.320
It deals with this huge
industry, which is the

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.520
communication industry.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.080
You look at the faculty here in
the department and you're a

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.760
little surprised to see that
there are so few faculty

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.630
members in digital
communication, so many faculty

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.960
members in the computer area.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.070
You wonder why this is.

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.810
It's sort of this historical
accident, because somehow or

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.930
other the department didn't
realize as these two fields

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.070
were growing, the one that
looked more glamorous for a

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.180
long time was the
computer field.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.840
Nobody in retrospect understands
why that is.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.580
But at the same time
that's how it is.

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.200
You will not see as much
excitement here.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.450
You also will see that because
of the big bust in the year

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.750
2000, there's much less
commercial activity in the

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.840
communications field now.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.410
As students, you ought
to relish this.

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.060
You ought to really be happy
about this if you want to go

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.950
into the communication field,
because at some point in the

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:24.010
future, all of the failure to
start new investments, and all

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.410
of the large communication
companies means a very

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.480
explosive growth is
about to start.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.170
So I don't think this is a
dead field by any means.

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.050
Looking back historically, every
time the communication

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.390
field has seemed dead, and I
can think of three or four

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.270
such times in history, those
have been the exact times

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.470
where it was great to
get into the field.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.660
There was a time in the early
'70s when all the

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.680
theoreticians who worked in
communication theory all were

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.070
going around with long faces
saying everything that we can

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.790
do has been done, the field is
dead, nothing more to do,

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.550
might as well give up and
go into another field.

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:15.080
This was really exactly the time
that a number of small

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.420
communication companies were
really starting to grow very

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.940
fast because they were using
some of the modern ideas of

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.340
communication theory and they
were using these modern ideas

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.980
to do new things.

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.160
You now see companies like
Qualcomm that were started

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.670
then, Motorola of whom
major divisions were

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.070
started back then.

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:41.420
An enormous amount of activity
was starting just then, partly

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.090
because the field seemed to be
moribund and the theoreticians

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.260
were turning and deciding well,
I guess we have to do

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.780
something practical now.

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.310
If you want to find a good
practical engineer, if you

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.840
wind up in industry, if you wind
up as an entrepreneur or

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.980
if you wind up climbing the
ladder and being a chief

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.380
executive, if you want to find
somebody who will really do

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.370
important things, find somebody
who understands

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.620
theory who has decided that they
suddenly want to start to

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.800
do practical things.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.900
Because if you point to the
people who have really done

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.570
exciting things in this field,
those are the ones who have

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:22.950
done most of it.

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:27.340
OK, so anyway, the big field,
it's an important field.

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:32.350
What we want to do is to study
the aspects of communication

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:37.380
systems that are unique to
communication systems.

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.900
In other words, we don't want
to study hardware here, we

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.180
don't want to study software
here, because hardware is

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.400
pretty much the same for any
problem you want to look at.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.810
It's not that highly
specialized, and software is

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:51.860
not either.

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.220
So we're not going to study
either of those things, we're

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.310
going to study much more the
architectural principles of

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:59.820
communication.

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.970
We're going to study a lot of
the theory of communication,

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:06.500
and I want to explain why it is
that we're going to do that

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:07.390
as we move on.

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:12.080
Because it's not at all clear at
first why we want to study

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.810
the silly things that we'll be
studying in the course, and I

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:19.460
want to give you some idea today
of why we're pushed into

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.370
doing that.

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.340
As we start doing these
things, I'll give

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.390
you more of an idea.

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:29.470
I know when I was a student I
couldn't figure out why I was

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:31.660
learning the things that
I was learning.

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.130
I just found that some things
were much more interesting

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:36.810
than others, and the things that
tended to be interesting

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:40.480
were the more theoretical
things, so I started looking

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:44.700
at them harder and thought
gee, this is neat stuff.

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:48.000
But I had no idea that it was
ever going to be important.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.190
So I'm going to try to explain
to you why this is important,

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:56.800
and something today about what
the proper inter-relationship

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.160
is of engineering and theory.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:04.800
As another example of my own
life, for a long time I

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:10.960
thought -- this is rather
embarrassing to say --

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:15.730
but I was a theoretician and not
much of an engineer for a

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:17.850
very long time.

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:20.570
And I kept worrying about this
and saying well the stuff I'm

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:24.530
doing is fun and I enjoy doing
it, but why should

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:27.070
anybody pay me for it?

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:30.450
Of course, I was being paid by
MIT, I was being paid as a

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:33.380
consultant, but I felt I was
robbing all these people.

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:37.600
And finally, I decided a
rationale for all of this.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:42.270
Most people felt that theory was
silly, and therefore, they

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:44.640
would keep asking me well,
if you're so smart

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.940
why aren't you rich?

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:50.530
I didn't have any very good
answer to that because I felt

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:53.390
I was smart because I understood
all this theory,

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:54.810
but I wasn't rich.

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:57.630
So I thought gee, what I've
gotta do is do enough

00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:00.750
engineering to get rich, and
then when people ask me that

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:02.780
question I can say I am.

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:09.910
I would suggest to all you, if
you have theoretical leadings,

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:14.170
to focus on some engineering
also so you can become rich,

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:17.420
not because there's anything to
do with the money, but just

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:22.440
because it lets you hold your
head up high in a society that

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:25.770
values money a lot more
than values intellect.

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:27.390
So it's important.

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:29.850
OK.

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:32.720
This is a part of this
two-term sequence.

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:37.580
One comment here is I'm not sure
that whether 6.451, which

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:40.800
is the second part of this
sequence, is going to be

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:43.590
taught in the spring or not.

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:48.020
It might not be taught until
spring of the following year.

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:51.400
If a large number of you decide
that you really want to

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:56.300
do this and do it now, make
yourselves heard a little bit

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:59.990
because the idea of a lot of
people want this course will

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:03.180
have something to do on whether
somebody manages to

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:04.430
teach it or not.

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:14.270
As I was starting to say, theory
has had a very large

00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:18.210
impact on almost every field
we can think of.

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:21.240
I mean you think of
electromagnetism, you think of

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:23.140
all these other fields
and theory is very

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:24.370
important in them.

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:29.650
But in communication systems it
is particularly important.

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:35.070
It's partly important because
back in 1948, Claude Shannon

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:38.160
who was the inventor of
information theory -- you

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:42.420
usually don't invent theories,
but he really did.

00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:46.500
This came whole cloth out
of this one mind.

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:49.990
He had these ideas turning
around in his head for about

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:53.620
eight years while the second
World War was going on.

00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:56.830
He was working on other things,
which were, in fact,

00:08:56.830 --> 00:09:01.140
very important things, and he
was doing those things for the

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:02.510
government.

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:05.900
He was working on aircraft
control and things like that.

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:09.040
He was working on
cryptography.

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:12.230
But he was just fascinated by
these communication problems

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:14.970
and he couldn't get
his mind off them.

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:19.050
He took up cryptography because
it happened to use all

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:21.900
the ideas that he was really
interested in.

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:26.030
He wrote something about
cryptography during the middle

00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:29.100
of the war, which made many
people believe that he had

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:32.040
done his cryptography work
before he did his

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:33.370
communication work.

00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:36.090
But in fact, it was the
other way around.

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:39.470
This was purely the fact that
he could write about

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:45.080
cryptography, and he never liked
to write, so he didn't

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:47.390
want to write about
communication because it was a

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:49.570
more complicated field
and he didn't

00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:51.640
understand the whole thing.

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:55.080
So for 25 years it was a
theory floating around.

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:57.840
You will learn a good deal
of what this theory is.

00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:02.160
Most graduate courses on
communication don't spend much

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:05.800
time on information theory.

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:09.910
This was not a mistake many,
many years ago, but it is a

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:14.790
mistake now, because
communication theory at its

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:17.930
core is information theory.

00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:19.300
Most people realize this.

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:22.760
Most kids recognize it,
most people in the

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:24.370
street recognize it.

00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:28.450
When they start to use a system
to communicate with the

00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:30.620
internet, what do
they talk about?

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:32.470
Do they talk about
the bandwidth?

00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:32.630
No.

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:35.560
They might call it bandwidth but
what they're talking about

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:38.750
is the number of bits per second
they can communicate.

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:41.930
This is a distinctly information
theoretic idea,

00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:45.470
because communication used to
be involved with studying

00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:47.490
different kinds of wave forms.

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:50.620
Suddenly, at this point, people
are studying all these

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:55.430
other things and are based on
Claude Shannon's ideas,

00:10:55.430 --> 00:11:00.640
therefore, we will teach some
of those ideas as we go.

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:05.960
As a matter of fact, I was
talking a little bit about the

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:11.020
fact that there's been a sort of
a love-hate relationship by

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:15.400
communication engineers for
information theory.

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:19.550
Back in 1960, a long, long time
ago when I got my PhD

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:25.080
degree, the people at MIT, the
people who started this field,

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:29.090
many of them told me that
information theory was dead at

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:30.360
that point.

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:33.180
There'd been an enormous amount
of research done on it

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:36.450
in the ten years before 1960.

00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:38.780
They told me I should go into
vacuum tubes, which was the

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:41.680
coming field at that time.

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:42.950
Two points to that story.

00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:45.800
If people tell you that
information theory isn't

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:49.880
important, please remember that
story or else tell them

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:53.940
to start to study
vacuum tubes.

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:56.620
The other point of it -- well,
I forgot what the other point

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:58.720
of it is so let's go on.

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:03.560
Anyway, information theory is
very much based on a bunch of

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:05.410
very abstract ideas.

00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:08.210
I will start to say what that
means as we go on, but

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:11.000
basically it means that
it's based on very

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.860
simple-minded models.

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:16.220
It's based on ignoring all
the complexities of the

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:20.650
communication systems and
starting to play with toy

00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:23.110
models and trying to
understand those.

00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:26.970
That's part of what we have to
understand to understand why

00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:28.310
we're doing what we're doing.

00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:35.390
A very complex relationship
between modeling, theory,

00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:39.780
exercises and engineering
design.

00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:42.290
Maybe I shouldn't be talking
about that now and maybe the

00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:45.660
notes shouldn't talk about it,
but I want to open the subject

00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:48.080
because I want you to be
thinking about that

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:49.430
throughout the term.

00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:52.000
Because it's something that
most people really don't

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.230
understand.

00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:55.260
Something that most teachers
don't understand.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:58.990
It's something that most
students don't understand.

00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:03.120
When you're a student, you do
the exercises you do because

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:05.290
you know you have to do them.

00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:09.660
There was a sort of apocryphal
story awhile ago that somebody

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:12.870
told me about a graduate
student, not at MIT, thank

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:18.700
God, who went into see the
person teaching a course on

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:22.240
wireless and saying, I don't
want to know all that theory,

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:24.850
I don't want to have to think
about these things, just tell

00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:28.450
me how to do the problems.

00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:33.210
Now, we will explain the
enormous stupidity of that as

00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:34.430
we move on.

00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:40.360
Part of the stupidity is that
the problems that you work on

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:43.230
as a graduate student, even in
your thesis, the problems that

00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:45.165
you work on are not
real problems.

00:13:45.165 --> 00:13:50.080
The problems that we work on
everywhere in engineering are

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:53.030
toy problems.

00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:56.480
We work on them because we want
to understand some aspect

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:58.060
of the real problem.

00:13:58.060 --> 00:14:01.190
We can never understand the
whole problem, so we study one

00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:03.890
aspect, then we study
another aspect.

00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:07.780
The reason for all these
equations that we have, it's

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:10.160
not a way to understand
reality.

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:11.120
It really isn't.

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:14.020
It's a way to understand little
pieces of reality.

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:17.370
You take all of those and after
you have all of these in

00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:21.020
your mind, you then start to
study the real engineering

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:24.850
problem and you say I put
together this and this and

00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:28.140
this and this and this -- this
is important, this is not so

00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:31.100
important, here, this
is more important.

00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:34.550
And then finally, if you're a
really good engineer, instead

00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:37.090
of writing down an equation, you
take an envelope, as the

00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:41.540
story goes, and you scribble
down a few numbers, and you

00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:45.650
say the way this system ought to
be built is the following.

00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:50.060
That's the way all important
systems get built, I claim.

00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:52.950
Important systems are not
designed by the kinds of

00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:55.550
things you do in homework
exercises.

00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:59.130
The things you do in homework
exercises are designed to help

00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:02.500
you understand small
pieces of problems.

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:05.570
You have to understand those
small pieces of problems in

00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:09.210
order to understand the whole
engineering problems, but you

00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:13.660
don't do simulations to build
a communications system.

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:17.570
You understand what the whole
system is, you can see it in

00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:20.830
your mind after you think about
it long enough, and

00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:24.370
that's where good system
design comes from.

00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:27.730
Simulations are a big part of
all of this, writing down

00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:29.860
equations are a big
part of it.

00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:33.190
But when you're all done, if
you design an engineering

00:15:33.190 --> 00:15:36.330
system and you don't see in your
mind why the whole thing

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:40.680
works, you will wind up with
something like Microsoft Word.

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:48.200
That's the truth.

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:53.910
So the exercises that we're
going to be doing are really

00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:58.940
aimed at understanding
these simple models.

00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:02.960
The point of the exercises is
not to get the right answer.

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:06.540
The answer is totally irrelevant
to everything.

00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:10.850
What's important is you start to
understand what assumptions

00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:14.090
in the problem lead to
what conclusions.

00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:18.040
How if you change something
it changes something else.

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:20.640
That's when you're using system
design, because in

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:24.440
system design you can never
understand the whole thing.

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:27.450
You have to look at what parts
of it are important, what

00:16:27.450 --> 00:16:30.440
parts of it aren't important,
and the only way you can do

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:33.830
that is having a catalog of the
simple-minded things in

00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:35.470
the back of your mind.

00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:40.820
Practical engineers get that by
dealing with real systems

00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:42.330
day-to-day all their lives.

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:44.850
They see catastrophes occur.

00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:49.420
Those things tell them what to
avoid and what not to avoid.

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:52.850
Students can do this in a
much more efficient way.

00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:56.970
Obviously, in the practical
experience also, but the

00:16:56.970 --> 00:17:01.090
experience that you get from
looking at these exercises and

00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:04.580
looking at this analytical
material in the right way,

00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:08.940
mainly looking at it is how do
you analyze these simple toy

00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:12.510
models, how do you make
conclusions from them is what

00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:16.090
let's you start being
a good engineer.

00:17:16.090 --> 00:17:20.880
I'm stressing this because at
some point this term, all of

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:25.190
you, all of you at different
times are going to start

00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:27.640
saying why the hell
am I doing this?

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:31.580
Why am I dealing with this
stupid little problem?

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:36.080
Stupid little problems can get
incredibly frustrating at

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:38.920
times, because you see something
that's so simple and

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:43.270
you can't understand it.

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:45.200
Then you say well, this
simple thing can't

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:46.980
be important anyway.

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:49.670
What I really want to do is
understand what this overall

00:17:49.670 --> 00:17:52.500
system is, and you give
up at that point.

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:55.250
Don't do that.

00:17:55.250 --> 00:18:02.500
Sometimes there's a very
difficult question about what

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:05.110
you mean by something
being simple.

00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:08.240
I will sometimes say that
something is very simple, and

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:14.530
I will offend many you to
whom it's not simple.

00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:17.650
The point is something
becomes simple after

00:18:17.650 --> 00:18:19.340
you understand it.

00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:22.200
Nothing is simple before
you understand it.

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:25.140
So there's that point at which
the light goes off in your

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:27.580
head at which it
becomes simple.

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:30.860
When I say that something is
simple, what I mean is that if

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:33.240
you think about it long enough
a light will go off in your

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:35.810
head and it will
become simple.

00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:37.960
It's not simple to start with.

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:41.050
Other things are just messy.

00:18:41.050 --> 00:18:43.610
You've all heard of mathematical
problems which

00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:45.290
are just ugly.

00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:48.270
There are these things of
extraordinary complexity.

00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:50.870
There are things where there
just isn't any structure.

00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:54.020
You see a lot of these things
in computer science.

00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:55.810
I talked about Microsoft Word.

00:18:55.810 --> 00:18:59.300
Part of the reason it's such a
lousy language is because the

00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:01.240
problem is incredibly
difficult.

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:03.230
It's incredibly unstructured.

00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:06.630
So people come up with things
that don't make any sense,

00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:09.700
because that inherently
is not simple.

00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:13.030
OK, these other things that
we'll be studying here are

00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:16.460
inherently simple and the only
problem is how do you get to

00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:21.070
the point of seeing these
simple ideas.

00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:24.710
OK, so that's enough
philosophy.

00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:31.710
No, not quite enough, a
little more of that.

00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:37.160
All the everyday communication
systems that we deal with are

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:41.490
incredibly complex in terms of
the amount of hardware, the

00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:43.100
amount of software in them.

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:45.640
If you look at the whole
system and you try to

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:50.020
understand it as a whole,
you don't have prayer.

00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:52.310
There's no way to do it.

00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:55.760
These things work and they can
be understood because they're

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:59.870
very highly structured.

00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:03.800
They have simple architectural
principles.

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:05.910
What do I mean by architectural
principles?

00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:09.390
It's a word that engineers
use more and more.

00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:13.030
It started off with computer
systems because it became

00:20:13.030 --> 00:20:15.720
essential there to start
thinking in terms of

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:16.700
architecture.

00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:19.020
It's exactly the same thing
that you mean when you're

00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:21.830
talking about a house
or a building.

00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:25.990
Mainly the architecture
is the overall design.

00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:29.000
It's the way the different
pieces fit together.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.510
In engineering, architecture
is the same thing.

00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:34.160
It's the thing that happens
when your eyes fuzz over a

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:38.500
little bit and you can't see
any of the details anymore,

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:41.170
and suddenly what you're doing
is you're looking at the whole

00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:43.540
thing as an entity
and saying how do

00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:46.320
the pieces fit together.

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:50.370
Well, what we're going to
be focusing on here.

00:20:50.370 --> 00:20:56.510
One of the major keys to making
these things simpler is

00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:57.560
to have standardized

00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:01.340
interfaces and to have layering.

00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:04.410
And we'll talk a little bit
about each of these because

00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:08.420
our entire study of this subject
is based on studying

00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:12.220
the different layers that
we'll wind up with.

00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:18.050
OK, the most important and most
critical interface in a

00:21:18.050 --> 00:21:20.950
communication system
is between the

00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:24.000
source and the channel.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.850
Today, that standard interface
is almost always

00:21:27.850 --> 00:21:30.250
a binary data stream.

00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:32.490
You all know this.

00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:37.070
When you talk about
your modab, how do

00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:38.920
you talk about it?

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:41.860
48 kilobits per second
if you're an

00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:44.180
old-fashioned kind of guy.

00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:49.250
1.2 megabits if you're a medium
technology person, or

00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:52.660
several gigabits if you're one
of these persons who likes to

00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:55.830
gobble up huge amounts
of stuff.

00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:58.130
That's the way you describe
channels -- how many bits per

00:21:58.130 --> 00:22:00.470
second can you send?

00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:04.790
The way you describe sources is
how many bits per second do

00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:08.540
you need as a way of viewing
that source.

00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:11.780
When you store a picture, how
do you talk about it?

00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:14.030
You don't talk about in terms of
the colors or any of these

00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:16.700
other things, picture
is a bunch of bits.

00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:21.820
That, at the fundamental
level, is

00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:22.940
what we're doing here.

00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:25.340
When you deal with source
coding, you're talking

00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:28.660
fundamentally about the problem
of taking whatever the

00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:33.050
source is, and it can be any
sort of thing at all -- it can

00:22:33.050 --> 00:22:37.460
be voice, it can be text, it can
be emails, the emails with

00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:42.680
viruses in it, whatever -- and
the problem is you want to

00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:46.020
turn it into a bit stream.

00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:50.500
Then this bit stream gets
presented to the channel.

00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:54.520
Channels and the channel
encoding equipment don't have

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:58.210
any idea of what those
bits mean.

00:22:58.210 --> 00:23:01.110
They don't want to have any idea
of what those bits mean.

00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:03.440
That's what an interface
means.

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:07.310
It means the problem of
interpreting the bits, the

00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:10.690
problem of going from something
which you view as

00:23:10.690 --> 00:23:14.650
having intelligence down to
a sequence of bits is the

00:23:14.650 --> 00:23:17.190
problem of the source coder.

00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:20.260
The problem of taking those bits
and moving them from one

00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:24.270
place to another is the function
of the channel

00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:29.250
designer, the network designer
and all of those things.

00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:32.760
When you talk about information
theory, it's a

00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:35.570
total misnomer from
the beginning.

00:23:35.570 --> 00:23:39.120
Information theory does not deal
with information at all,

00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:41.230
it deals with data.

00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:45.390
We will understand what that
distinction is as we go on.

00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:48.250
When you talk about a bit
stream, what you're talking

00:23:48.250 --> 00:23:51.740
about is a sequence of data.

00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:53.970
It doesn't mean anything.

00:23:53.970 --> 00:23:57.040
It's just that a one is
different from a zero, and you

00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:59.200
don't care how it's different,
it just is.

00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:05.390
So the channel input
is a binary stream.

00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:07.210
It doesn't have any
meaning as far as

00:24:07.210 --> 00:24:08.670
the channel is concerned.

00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:11.520
The bit stream does have a
meaning as far as the source

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:13.020
is concerned.

00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:18.290
So the problem is the source
encoder takes these bits,

00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:23.030
takes the source, whatever it
is, with its meaning and

00:24:23.030 --> 00:24:26.960
everything else, turns it
into a stream of bits --

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:30.700
you would like to turn it into
as few bits as possible.

00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:33.960
Then you take those bits, you
transmit them on the channel,

00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:37.050
the channel designer understands
what the physical

00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:40.000
medium is all about, understands
what the network

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.630
is all about, and doesn't
have a clue as to what

00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:45.200
all those bits mean.

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:46.610
So the picture is
the following.

00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:57.350
That's the major layering of
all communication systems.

00:24:57.350 --> 00:25:01.500
Here's the input, which is
whatever it happens to be.

00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:03.250
Here's the source encoder.

00:25:03.250 --> 00:25:07.970
The source encoder has to
know a great deal about

00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:09.490
what that input is.

00:25:09.490 --> 00:25:11.160
You have to know the structure
of the input.

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:15.880
You have a source encoder for
voice and you use it to try to

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:21.400
encode a video stream it's not
going to work, obviously.

00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:24.340
If you try to use a source
encoder for English and try to

00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:29.860
use it on Chinese, it probably
won't work very well either.

00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:33.600
It won't work for anything
other than what

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:34.460
it's intended for.

00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:38.910
So the source encoder has to
understand the source.

00:25:38.910 --> 00:25:42.280
When I say understand the
source, what do I mean?

00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:44.340
It means to understand
the probabilistic

00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:47.150
structure of the source.

00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:52.080
This is another of the things
that Shannon recognized

00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:57.600
clearly that hadn't been
recognized at all before this.

00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:02.610
You have to somehow understand
how to view what's coming out

00:26:02.610 --> 00:26:08.090
of the source, this picture,
say, as one of a possible set

00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:10.470
of pictures.

00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:14.950
If you know ahead of time that
a communication system is

00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:21.110
going to be sending the
Gettysburg Address or one of

00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:28.230
50 other highly-inspiring
texts, what do you do?

00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:31.950
Do you try to encode
these things, all

00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:33.120
these different texts?

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:34.100
Of course not.

00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:36.790
You just assign number one to
the Gettysburg Address, number

00:26:36.790 --> 00:26:39.690
two to the second thing that
you might be interested in.

00:26:39.690 --> 00:26:43.500
You send a number and then at
the output out comes the

00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:46.930
Gettysburg Address because
you've stored that there.

00:26:46.930 --> 00:26:49.220
So that's the idea
of source coding.

00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:53.790
What is important is not the
complexity of the individual

00:26:53.790 --> 00:26:57.110
messages, it's the probabilistic
structure that

00:26:57.110 --> 00:27:00.330
tells you what are the different
possibilities.

00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:02.530
That's what happens when
you try to turn

00:27:02.530 --> 00:27:04.440
things into binary digits.

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:07.780
You have one sequence of binary
digits for each of the

00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:11.890
possible things that you
want to represent.

00:27:11.890 --> 00:27:13.960
Then in the channel you have
the same sort of thing.

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:16.760
You have noise, you have all
sorts of other crazy things on

00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:18.220
the channel.

00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:21.470
You have a sequence of bits
coming in, you have a sequence

00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:23.160
of bits coming out.

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:27.030
The fundamental problem of the
channel is very, very simple.

00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:30.440
You want to spit out the
same bits that came in.

00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:34.360
You can take a certain amount
of delay doing that, but

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:36.110
that's what you have to do.

00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:39.170
In order to do that, you have to
understand something about

00:27:39.170 --> 00:27:42.110
the probabilistic structure
of the noise.

00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:45.290
So both ways you have
probabilistic structure.

00:27:45.290 --> 00:27:50.170
It's why you have to understand
probability at the

00:27:50.170 --> 00:27:55.250
level of 6.041, which is the
undergraduate course here

00:27:55.250 --> 00:27:56.950
studying probability.

00:27:56.950 --> 00:28:00.010
If you don't have that
background, please don't take

00:28:00.010 --> 00:28:03.680
the course because you're
going to be crucified.

00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:09.660
If you think you can learn
it on the fly, don't.

00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:11.680
You can't learn it on the fly.

00:28:14.570 --> 00:28:18.650
As a matter of fact, if you've
taken the course, you still

00:28:18.650 --> 00:28:24.530
don't understand it, and you
will need to scramble a little

00:28:24.530 --> 00:28:27.900
bit to understand it at a
deeper level in order to

00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:29.910
understand what's
going on here.

00:28:29.910 --> 00:28:34.190
6.041 is a particularly good
undergraduate course.

00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:36.650
I think it's probably taught
here better than it's taught

00:28:36.650 --> 00:28:38.710
at most places.

00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:41.410
But you still don't understand
it the first time through.

00:28:41.410 --> 00:28:47.330
It's a tricky, subtle subject
you really need to understand

00:28:47.330 --> 00:28:50.370
enough of it, If you have
no exposure to it.

00:28:50.370 --> 00:28:52.630
If you've taken a course
called statistics and

00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:56.220
probability, which first teaches
you statistics and

00:28:56.220 --> 00:29:01.070
then tucks in a little bit of
probability at the end, go

00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:04.710
learn probability first because
you don't have enough

00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:07.940
of it to take this subject.

00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:12.640
The other part of dealing with
these channels is that

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:16.070
suddenly we have to deal with
4AA analysis and all of these

00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:20.090
things, if you don't have
some kind of subject

00:29:20.090 --> 00:29:22.020
in signals and systems.

00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:24.480
Some computer scientists
don't learn that

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:26.070
kind of material anymore.

00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:29.510
Again, you can't learn it on
the fly because you need a

00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:32.240
little bit of background
for it.

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:35.530
Those two prerequisites
are really essential.

00:29:35.530 --> 00:29:37.810
Nothing else is essential.

00:29:37.810 --> 00:29:40.960
The more mathematics you know
the better off you are, but we

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:43.470
will develop what we
need as we go.

00:29:50.150 --> 00:29:53.510
Now, we talked about this
fundamental layer in all

00:29:53.510 --> 00:29:57.030
communication systems, which is
between source coding and

00:29:57.030 --> 00:29:58.670
channel coding.

00:29:58.670 --> 00:30:02.470
You first turn the source into
bits, and then you turn the

00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:06.290
bits into something you can
transmit on the channel.

00:30:06.290 --> 00:30:10.840
Source coding breaks down into
three pieces itself.

00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:13.980
It doesn't have to break down
into those three pieces, but

00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:16.590
it usually does.

00:30:16.590 --> 00:30:21.330
Most source coding you start out
with a wave form, such as

00:30:21.330 --> 00:30:26.860
with voice, or with pictures you
start out with what's more

00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:30.130
complicated than a wave form,
some kind of mapping from

00:30:30.130 --> 00:30:35.110
x-coordinate and y-coordinate
and time, and you map all of

00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:40.980
those things into something.

00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:45.420
Our problem here is we want to
take these analog wave forms

00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:46.885
or generalizations of.

00:30:46.885 --> 00:30:49.720
It turns out that all we have
to deal with here is the

00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:52.630
analog wave forms because
everything else

00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:54.370
follows easily from that.

00:30:54.370 --> 00:30:55.320
So there's one question.

00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:58.790
How do you turn an analog
wave form into

00:30:58.790 --> 00:31:00.810
a sequence of numbers?

00:31:00.810 --> 00:31:06.020
This is the common way of
doing source coding.

00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:08.180
Many of you who have been
exposed to the sampling

00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:10.810
theorem, you think that's the
way to do it, this is

00:31:10.810 --> 00:31:12.590
one way to do it.

00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:14.870
We will talk a great
deal about this.

00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:18.260
You will find out that the
sampling theorem really isn't

00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:19.270
the way to do it.

00:31:19.270 --> 00:31:22.080
Although again, it's a simple
model, it's the way to start

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:23.220
dealing with it.

00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:25.350
Then you learn the various
other parts of

00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:27.070
that as you go along.

00:31:27.070 --> 00:31:30.130
After you wind up with
sequences, sequences of

00:31:30.130 --> 00:31:34.750
numbers, we worry about how
to quantize those numbers,

00:31:34.750 --> 00:31:37.670
because fundamentally we're
trying to get from

00:31:37.670 --> 00:31:40.220
wave forms into bits.

00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:43.970
So the three stages in that
process are first go to

00:31:43.970 --> 00:31:48.910
sequences, go from sequences to
symbols -- namely, you have

00:31:48.910 --> 00:31:53.470
a finite number of symbols,
which are quantized versions

00:31:53.470 --> 00:31:56.910
of those analog numbers
which can be anything.

00:31:56.910 --> 00:32:01.360
Then finally, you encode
the symbols into bits.

00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:03.920
The coding goes in the
opposite order.

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:08.480
Here's a picture which shows it
better than the words do.

00:32:11.270 --> 00:32:16.310
From the input wave form, you
sample it or something more

00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:18.770
generalized than sampling it.

00:32:18.770 --> 00:32:21.450
That gives you a sequence
of numbers.

00:32:21.450 --> 00:32:24.380
You quantize those numbers,
that gives

00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:26.690
you a symbol sequence.

00:32:26.690 --> 00:32:30.140
You have a discrete coder, which
turns those symbols into

00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:33.410
a sequence of bits
in some nice way.

00:32:33.410 --> 00:32:36.460
Then you have this reliable
binary channel.

00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:38.500
Notice what I've done here.

00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:41.520
This thing is that entire
system we were

00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:43.300
talking about before.

00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:47.560
This has a channel encoder in
it, a channel, a channel

00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:50.140
decoder and all of that.

00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:53.900
But what we've been saying in
this layering idea is when

00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:57.580
you're dealing with source
coding you ignore all of that.

00:32:57.580 --> 00:33:02.700
You say OK, it's Tom's job who
was designing the channel

00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:05.880
encoder to make sure that
my bits come out

00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:08.400
here as the same bits.

00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:10.740
If the bits are wrong
it's his fault.

00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:15.210
If the bits are right, and this
output wave form doesn't

00:33:15.210 --> 00:33:19.130
look like the input wave
form, it's my fault.

00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:24.260
So part of the layering idea is
we just recreate this whole

00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:28.370
thing here as the same bits and
we don't worry about what

00:33:28.370 --> 00:33:32.470
happens when the bits
are different.

00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:36.490
The other part of this is
that all of this breaks

00:33:36.490 --> 00:33:40.120
down in the same way.

00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:45.870
Namely, at this interface
between here and here, the

00:33:45.870 --> 00:33:47.480
idea is the same.

00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:50.470
Namely, there's an input wave
form that comes in, there's a

00:33:50.470 --> 00:33:53.540
sequence of numbers here.

00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:56.670
The job of this analog filter,
as we call it, and you'll see

00:33:56.670 --> 00:34:01.500
why we call it that later, is
to take numbers here, turn

00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:04.370
them back into wave forms.

00:34:04.370 --> 00:34:08.526
These numbers are supposed to
resemble these numbers in some

00:34:08.526 --> 00:34:10.300
way or other.

00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:14.600
I can deal with this part of the
problem totally separately

00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:17.350
from dealing with the other
parts of the problem.

00:34:17.350 --> 00:34:20.810
Namely, the only problem here is
how do I take numbers, turn

00:34:20.810 --> 00:34:23.520
them into wave forms.

00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:26.880
There are a bunch of other
problems hidden here, like

00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:30.180
these numbers are not going to
be exactly the same as these

00:34:30.180 --> 00:34:33.910
wave forms because I have
quantization involved here.

00:34:33.910 --> 00:34:36.920
Since the numbers are not
exactly the same, we have to

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:39.280
deal with questions
of approximation.

00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:43.250
How to approximations in numbers
come out in terms of

00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:46.120
approximations in terms
of wave forms?

00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:49.380
That's where you need things
like the sampling theorem and

00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:51.740
the generalizations of it that
we're going to spend

00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:52.980
a lot of time with.

00:34:52.980 --> 00:34:55.390
Then you go down
to this point.

00:34:55.390 --> 00:34:59.900
At this point the quantizer
produces a string of symbols.

00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:04.180
Whatever those symbols happen
to be, but those symbols

00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:07.810
might, in fact, just be integers
whereas the things

00:35:07.810 --> 00:35:12.440
here were real valued numbers,
and in quantizing we turn real

00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:17.560
numbers into intergers by saying
-- well, it's the same

00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:19.420
way you approximate things
all the time.

00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:22.620
You round off the pennies
in your checkbook.

00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:25.720
It's the same idea.

00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:29.300
So the problem here is the
quantizer produces these

00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:31.530
symbols here.

00:35:31.530 --> 00:35:35.410
The job of all of this stuff
is to recreate those same

00:35:35.410 --> 00:35:38.090
symbols here.

00:35:38.090 --> 00:35:41.020
So the symbols now go into
something that does the

00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:42.750
reverse of a quantizer --

00:35:42.750 --> 00:35:44.690
we'll call it a table look-up
because that's

00:35:44.690 --> 00:35:46.090
sort of what it is.

00:35:46.090 --> 00:35:50.890
So we can study this part of the
problem separately, also.

00:35:50.890 --> 00:35:53.890
You don't have to understand
anything about this problem to

00:35:53.890 --> 00:35:56.580
understand this problem.

00:35:56.580 --> 00:36:01.430
Finally, we have symbols here
going into a discrete encoder.

00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:04.390
We have an interesting problem
which says how do we take

00:36:04.390 --> 00:36:07.310
these symbols which have some
kind of probabilistic

00:36:07.310 --> 00:36:11.500
structure to them and turn them
into binary digits in an

00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:12.960
efficient way.

00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:17.760
If the symbols here, for
example, are binary symbols

00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:24.500
and the symbols happen to be 1
with probability 999 out of

00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:29.000
1,000, and zero with probability
1 in 1,000, you

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:32.300
don't really just want to take
these symbols and map them in

00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:35.420
a straightforward way, 1 into
1 and zero into zero.

00:36:35.420 --> 00:36:37.600
You want to look at whole
sequences of them.

00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:39.460
You want to do run length
coding, for example.

00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:44.210
You want to count how long it
is between these zero's, and

00:36:44.210 --> 00:36:47.260
then what you do is send those
counts and you encode them.

00:36:47.260 --> 00:36:50.000
So there are all kinds of tricks
that you can use here.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:53.870
But the point is, this problem
is separate, and this problem

00:36:53.870 --> 00:36:56.480
is separate from this problem.

00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:58.980
Now what we're going to do in
this course is start out with

00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:04.140
this problem, because this is
the cleanest and the neatest

00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:06.460
of the three problems.

00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:09.700
It's the one you can
say the most about.

00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:12.920
It's the one which has the
nicest results about it.

00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:16.430
In fact, a lot of source coding
problems just deal with

00:37:16.430 --> 00:37:17.510
this one part of it.

00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:20.820
Whenever you're encoding text,
you're starting out with

00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:24.060
symbols which are the letters
of whatever language you're

00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:27.340
dealing with and perhaps a bunch
of other things -- ask a

00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:31.570
code, you've generated 256
different things, including

00:37:31.570 --> 00:37:34.540
all the letters, all the capital
letters, all of the

00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:37.850
junk that used to be on
typewriters, and some of the

00:37:37.850 --> 00:37:41.430
junk that's now in word
processing languages, and you

00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:44.310
have a way of mapping those
into binary digits.

00:37:44.310 --> 00:37:46.600
We want to look at better
ways of doing that.

00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:50.240
So this, in fact, covers the
whole problem of source coding

00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:53.950
when you're dealing with
text rather than

00:37:53.950 --> 00:37:57.150
dealing with wave forms.

00:37:57.150 --> 00:38:01.120
This problem here combined with
this problem deals with

00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:03.720
all of these many problems where
what you're interested

00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:07.780
in is taking a sequence of
numbers or a sequence of

00:38:07.780 --> 00:38:10.190
whatjamacallits and
quantitizing

00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:12.050
them and then coding.

00:38:12.050 --> 00:38:15.180
Finally, when you get to the
input wave forms and output

00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:18.830
wave forms, you've solved both
of these problems and you can

00:38:18.830 --> 00:38:21.760
then focus on what's
important here.

00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:25.660
This is a good case study of why
the information theoretic

00:38:25.660 --> 00:38:29.010
approach works and
why theory works.

00:38:29.010 --> 00:38:31.760
Because if you started out with
the problem of saying I

00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:36.300
want to build something to
encode voice, and you try to

00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:39.700
do all of these together, and
you look up all the things you

00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:44.070
can find about voice encoding on
the web and you read all of

00:38:44.070 --> 00:38:47.320
them, what you will wind up
with, I can guarantee you, is

00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:50.990
you will know an enormous amount
of jargon, you will

00:38:50.990 --> 00:38:54.210
know an enormous number of
different systems, which each

00:38:54.210 --> 00:38:59.420
half work, you will not have the
slightest clue as to how

00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:02.420
to build a better system.

00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:05.640
So you have to take the
structured viewpoint, which is

00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:09.090
really the only way to do things
to find new and better

00:39:09.090 --> 00:39:11.430
ways of doing things.

00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:20.530
Now there are some
extra things.

00:39:20.530 --> 00:39:22.940
I have over-simplified it.

00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:25.850
I want to over-simplify
things in this course.

00:39:25.850 --> 00:39:29.170
What I will always do is I'll
try to cheat you into thinking

00:39:29.170 --> 00:39:33.760
the problem is simpler than it
is, and then I will talk about

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:37.760
all of the added little nasties
that come in as soon

00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:40.080
as you try to use any
of this stuff.

00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:41.890
There are always nasties.

00:39:41.890 --> 00:39:46.010
What I hope you will all do by
the end of the term is find

00:39:46.010 --> 00:39:49.680
those little nasties on your
own before I start to talk

00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:50.390
about them.

00:39:50.390 --> 00:39:53.700
Namely, when we start to talk
about a simple model, be

00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:57.610
interested in the simple model,
study it, find out what

00:39:57.610 --> 00:40:01.230
it's all about, but at the same
time, for Pete's sake,

00:40:01.230 --> 00:40:02.670
ask yourself the question.

00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:06.940
What does this have to do with
the price of rice in China or

00:40:06.940 --> 00:40:09.050
with anything else?

00:40:09.050 --> 00:40:10.520
And ask those questions.

00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:13.840
Don't let those questions
interfere with understanding

00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:17.280
the simple model, but you've got
to always be focusing on

00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:23.030
how that simple model relates
to what you visualize as a

00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:26.630
communication system problem.

00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:28.540
It usually will have
some relation but

00:40:28.540 --> 00:40:30.250
not a complete relation.

00:40:30.250 --> 00:40:34.590
Here the problems are in
this binary interface.

00:40:34.590 --> 00:40:39.580
The source might produce packets
or the source might

00:40:39.580 --> 00:40:41.870
produce a stream of data.

00:40:41.870 --> 00:40:45.480
In other words, if what you're
dealing with is the kind of

00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:50.270
situation where you're an
amateur photographer, you go

00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:53.840
around taking all sorts of
pictures, and then you encode

00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:55.420
these pictures --

00:40:55.420 --> 00:40:57.130
what do I mean by encoding
the pictures?

00:40:57.130 --> 00:41:00.010
You turn them into
binary digits.

00:41:00.010 --> 00:41:03.040
Then you want to send your
pictures to somebody else, but

00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:05.590
what you're really doing is
sending these packets to

00:41:05.590 --> 00:41:06.560
someone else.

00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:09.580
You're not sending a stream of
data -- you have 10 pictures,

00:41:09.580 --> 00:41:12.180
you want to send those
10 pictures.

00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:15.300
At the output of the whole
system, you hope you see 10

00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:16.270
separate pictures.

00:41:16.270 --> 00:41:20.310
You hope there's something in
there which can recognize that

00:41:20.310 --> 00:41:23.020
out of the stream of binary
digits that come across the

00:41:23.020 --> 00:41:26.350
channel, there's some packet
structure there.

00:41:26.350 --> 00:41:29.490
Well we're not going to talk
about that really.

00:41:29.490 --> 00:41:32.600
Whenever you start dealing with
this problem of source

00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:35.700
encoding, you also need to worry
a little bit about the

00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:36.750
packet structure.

00:41:36.750 --> 00:41:40.720
What are the protocols for
knowing when something new

00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:43.900
starts, when something
new ends.

00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:46.790
Those kinds of problems are
dealt with mostly in a network

00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:50.590
course here, and you can find
out all sorts of things about

00:41:50.590 --> 00:41:51.150
them there.

00:41:51.150 --> 00:41:53.750
But there are these two general
types of things --

00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:56.860
packets and streams of data.

00:41:56.860 --> 00:41:59.560
In terms of understanding voice
encoding, you can study

00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:01.000
them both together.

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:02.790
Why can you study them
both together?

00:42:02.790 --> 00:42:05.980
Because the packets are long
and because the packets are

00:42:05.980 --> 00:42:08.960
long because they include a lot
of data, you have a little

00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:12.110
bit of end effect about how to
start it, a little bit of end

00:42:12.110 --> 00:42:15.110
effect about how to end it,
but the main structural

00:42:15.110 --> 00:42:17.200
problem you'll be dealing
with is what to do

00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:19.010
with the whole thing.

00:42:19.010 --> 00:42:23.550
It's an added piece that comes
at the end to worry about how

00:42:23.550 --> 00:42:26.690
do you denote the beginning
and the end.

00:42:26.690 --> 00:42:29.970
That's a problem you have with
stream data also, because

00:42:29.970 --> 00:42:34.820
stream data does not start
at time minus infinity.

00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:37.300
Whatever the stream data is
coming from, what it's coming

00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:40.060
from did not at time,
t equals infinity.

00:42:40.060 --> 00:42:43.810
You just think of it that way
because you recognize you can

00:42:43.810 --> 00:42:47.450
postpone the problem of how do
you start it and how do you

00:42:47.450 --> 00:42:51.650
end it, and hopefully you can
postpone it until somebody

00:42:51.650 --> 00:42:53.040
else has taken over the job.

00:42:55.700 --> 00:42:58.300
What the channel accepts is
either of these binary streams

00:42:58.300 --> 00:43:02.300
or packets, but then
queueing exists.

00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:05.650
In other words, you have stuff
coming into a channel --

00:43:05.650 --> 00:43:09.330
sometimes I'm sitting at home
and I want to send long files,

00:43:09.330 --> 00:43:10.830
I want to send this
whole textbook

00:43:10.830 --> 00:43:13.260
I'm writing to somebody.

00:43:13.260 --> 00:43:16.870
It queues up, it takes a long
time to get it out of my

00:43:16.870 --> 00:43:20.110
computer and into this other
person's computer.

00:43:20.110 --> 00:43:23.370
It would be nice if I could
send it at optical speeds.

00:43:23.370 --> 00:43:24.410
But I don't care much.

00:43:24.410 --> 00:43:28.750
I don't care much whether it
takes a second or a minute or

00:43:28.750 --> 00:43:30.740
an hour to get to this
other person.

00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:35.190
He won't read it for a week
anyway, if he reads it at all,

00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:37.230
so what difference
does it make?

00:43:37.230 --> 00:43:39.650
But anyway, we have these
queueing problems, which are,

00:43:39.650 --> 00:43:40.990
again, separable.

00:43:40.990 --> 00:43:44.550
They're dealt with mostly
in the network course.

00:43:44.550 --> 00:43:48.710
What we're mostly interested in
is how to reduce bit rate

00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:49.520
for sources.

00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:52.080
How do you encode things
more efficiently?

00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:54.920
Data compression is the word
usually given to this.

00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:58.970
How do you compress things into
a smaller number of bits

00:43:58.970 --> 00:44:01.790
using the statistical
structure of it?

00:44:01.790 --> 00:44:04.570
Then how do you increase the
number of bits you can send

00:44:04.570 --> 00:44:05.470
over a channel?

00:44:05.470 --> 00:44:07.340
That's the problem
with channels.

00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:11.240
If you have a channel that'll
send 4,800 bits per second,

00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:14.440
which is what telephone
lines used to do.

00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:17.550
If you build a new product
that sends 9,600 bits per

00:44:17.550 --> 00:44:21.080
second, which was a major
technological achievement back

00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:26.540
in the '70s and '80s, suddenly
your company becomes a very

00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:29.140
important communication
player.

00:44:29.140 --> 00:44:32.450
If you then take the same
channel and learn how to

00:44:32.450 --> 00:44:36.770
communicate at megabits over it,
that's a major thing also.

00:44:36.770 --> 00:44:39.080
How did people learn
to do that?

00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:43.340
Mostly by using all the ideas
that the people used in going

00:44:43.340 --> 00:44:47.900
from 4,800 bits per second
to 9,600 bits per second.

00:44:47.900 --> 00:44:51.830
It was the people who did that
first job who were the primary

00:44:51.830 --> 00:44:55.260
people involved in
the second job.

00:44:55.260 --> 00:44:57.870
The point of that is it doesn't
really make any

00:44:57.870 --> 00:45:01.690
difference as an engineer
whether you're going from

00:45:01.690 --> 00:45:10.040
4,800 to 9,600 or from 9,600 to
19.2 or from 19.9 to 38.4

00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:12.640
or whatever it is,
or so forth up.

00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:16.120
Each one of these is just
putting in a few new goodies,

00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:18.790
recognizing a few new things,
making the system

00:45:18.790 --> 00:45:20.040
a little bit better.

00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:24.150
Let's talk about the
channel now.

00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:28.340
The channel is given --

00:45:28.340 --> 00:45:31.050
in other words, it's not under
the control of the designer.

00:45:31.050 --> 00:45:34.820
This is something we haven't
talked about yet.

00:45:34.820 --> 00:45:39.880
In all of these communication
system design problems, one of

00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:44.180
the things that gets straight is
when you're worrying about

00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:48.440
the engineering of something,
what parts of the system can

00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:53.540
you control and what parts
of it can't you control.

00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:57.040
Even more when you get into
layering -- what parts can you

00:45:57.040 --> 00:45:59.920
control and what parts can
other people control.

00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:02.750
Namely, if I have some source
and I'm trying to transmit it

00:46:02.750 --> 00:46:07.330
over some physical channel and I
have two engineers -- one of

00:46:07.330 --> 00:46:12.380
them is a data compressor, and
the other is a channel guy.

00:46:12.380 --> 00:46:15.830
What the channel guy is trying
to do is to find a way of

00:46:15.830 --> 00:46:18.570
sending more bits over
this channel than

00:46:18.570 --> 00:46:20.170
could be done before.

00:46:20.170 --> 00:46:24.050
What the data compressor is
trying to do is to find a way

00:46:24.050 --> 00:46:28.180
to encode the source
into fewer bits.

00:46:28.180 --> 00:46:31.560
If the two come together,
the whole thing works.

00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:34.550
If the two don't come together,
then you have to

00:46:34.550 --> 00:46:37.710
fire the engineers, hire some
new engineers or do something

00:46:37.710 --> 00:46:39.890
else or you get fired.

00:46:39.890 --> 00:46:44.270
So that's the story.

00:46:44.270 --> 00:46:46.720
The things you can't change
here, you can't change the

00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:50.620
structure of the source usually,
and you can't change

00:46:50.620 --> 00:46:52.700
the structure of the channel.

00:46:52.700 --> 00:46:55.700
There's some very interesting
new problems coming into

00:46:55.700 --> 00:46:59.430
existence these days by
information theorists who are

00:46:59.430 --> 00:47:02.540
trying to study biological
systems.

00:47:02.540 --> 00:47:06.720
One of the peculiar things in
trying to understand how

00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:11.320
biological organisms, which have
remarkable systems for

00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:15.870
communicating information from
one place to another, how they

00:47:15.870 --> 00:47:17.380
manage to do it.

00:47:17.380 --> 00:47:20.720
One of the things you find is
that this separation that we

00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:24.820
use in studying electronic
communication does not exist

00:47:24.820 --> 00:47:26.800
in the body at all.

00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:30.020
In other words, what we
call a source gets

00:47:30.020 --> 00:47:32.440
blended with the channel.

00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:35.910
What we call the statistics of
the source get very much

00:47:35.910 --> 00:47:39.130
blended in with what this
organism is trying to do.

00:47:39.130 --> 00:47:42.840
If the organism cannot send such
refined data, it figures

00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:46.680
out ways to get the data that
it needs which is essential

00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:50.390
for its survival or it
dies and some other

00:47:50.390 --> 00:47:52.590
organism takes over.

00:47:52.590 --> 00:47:56.740
So you find the system which has
no constraints in it, and

00:47:56.740 --> 00:47:58.820
it evolves with all
of these things

00:47:58.820 --> 00:48:00.760
changing at the same time.

00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:03.650
The channels are changing,
the source statistics are

00:48:03.650 --> 00:48:07.790
changing, and the way the source
data is encoded is

00:48:07.790 --> 00:48:12.360
changing, and the way the data
is transmitted is changing.

00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:14.940
So it's a whole new
generalization of this whole

00:48:14.940 --> 00:48:17.210
problem of how do
you communicate.

00:48:17.210 --> 00:48:20.510
Here though, the problem we're
dealing with is these fixed

00:48:20.510 --> 00:48:26.210
channels, which you can think
of, depending on what your

00:48:26.210 --> 00:48:30.670
interests are, you can view the
canonical channel as being

00:48:30.670 --> 00:48:35.110
a piece of wire in a telephone
network, or even view it as

00:48:35.110 --> 00:48:41.000
being a cable in a cable TV
system, or you can view it as

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:42.670
being a wireless channel.

00:48:42.670 --> 00:48:44.760
We will talk about all of
these in the course.

00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:48.890
The last three weeks of the
course is primarily talking

00:48:48.890 --> 00:48:52.540
about wireless because that's
where the problems are most

00:48:52.540 --> 00:48:55.380
interesting.

00:48:55.380 --> 00:49:01.910
But in any situation we look
at, the channel is fixed.

00:49:01.910 --> 00:49:04.500
It's given to us and
we can't change it.

00:49:04.500 --> 00:49:08.520
All we can do fiddle around with
the channel encoding and

00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:10.460
the channel decoding.

00:49:10.460 --> 00:49:13.750
The channels that we're most
interested in usually send

00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:15.510
wave forms.

00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:17.530
That brings up another
interesting question.

00:49:17.530 --> 00:49:21.140
We call this digital
communication, and what I've

00:49:21.140 --> 00:49:24.230
been telling you is that the
sources that we're interested

00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:28.890
in are most often wave
form sources.

00:49:28.890 --> 00:49:31.600
The channels that we're
interested in are most often

00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:34.870
channels that send wave forms,
receive wave forms and add

00:49:34.870 --> 00:49:36.920
noise, which is wave forms.

00:49:36.920 --> 00:49:38.910
Why do we call it digital
communication?

00:49:42.450 --> 00:49:45.760
Anybody have a clue as to why
we might call all of this

00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:48.700
digital communication?

00:49:48.700 --> 00:49:48.950
Yeah?

00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:50.200
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:52.590 --> 00:49:55.660
PROFESSOR: Because the analog
gets represented in binary

00:49:55.660 --> 00:50:01.040
digits, because we have chosen
essentially, because of having

00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:05.180
studied Shannon at some point,
to turn all the analog sources

00:50:05.180 --> 00:50:08.070
into binary bit streams.

00:50:08.070 --> 00:50:10.900
Namely, when you talk about
digital communication, what

00:50:10.900 --> 00:50:14.220
you're really doing is saying I
have decided there will be a

00:50:14.220 --> 00:50:18.800
digital interface between
source and channel.

00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:20.820
That's what digital
communication is.

00:50:20.820 --> 00:50:23.370
That's what most communication
today is.

00:50:23.370 --> 00:50:26.050
There's very little
communication today that

00:50:26.050 --> 00:50:29.750
starts out with an analog wave
form and finds a way to

00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:36.130
transmit it without first going
into a binary sequence.

00:50:36.130 --> 00:50:39.850
So here's a picture of one
of the noises that

00:50:39.850 --> 00:50:42.430
we're going to study.

00:50:42.430 --> 00:50:47.640
We have an input which
is now a wave form.

00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:51.700
We have noise, which
is a wave form.

00:50:51.700 --> 00:50:55.180
And we have an output,
which is a wave form.

00:50:55.180 --> 00:51:01.280
This input here is going to be
created somehow in a process

00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:06.380
of modulation from this binary
stream that's coming into the

00:51:06.380 --> 00:51:07.730
channel encoder.

00:51:07.730 --> 00:51:11.020
So somehow or other we're
taking a binary stream,

00:51:11.020 --> 00:51:14.820
turning it into a wave form.

00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:17.900
Now, think a little bit about
what might be essential in

00:51:17.900 --> 00:51:19.150
that process.

00:51:25.110 --> 00:51:28.530
If you know something about
practical engineering systems

00:51:28.530 --> 00:51:32.620
for communication, you know that
there's an organization

00:51:32.620 --> 00:51:37.130
in the U.S. called the FCC, and
every other country has

00:51:37.130 --> 00:51:43.450
its companion set of initials,
which says what part of the

00:51:43.450 --> 00:51:46.650
radio spectrum you can use and
what part of the radio

00:51:46.650 --> 00:51:49.510
spectrum you can't use.

00:51:49.510 --> 00:51:51.870
You suddenly realize that
somehow it's going to be

00:51:51.870 --> 00:51:57.260
important to turn these binary
streams into wave forms, which

00:51:57.260 --> 00:52:02.360
are more or less compressed
into some frequency bands.

00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:03.670
That's one of the problems
we're going to

00:52:03.670 --> 00:52:06.120
have to worry about.

00:52:06.120 --> 00:52:11.270
But at some level if I take
a whole bunch of different

00:52:11.270 --> 00:52:17.330
binary sequences, one thing I
can do, for example, I could

00:52:17.330 --> 00:52:20.730
take a binary sequence
of length 100.

00:52:20.730 --> 00:52:24.160
How many such binary sequences
are there?

00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:28.030
Has length 100, the first bit
can be 1 or zero, second bit

00:52:28.030 --> 00:52:30.650
can be 1 or zero -- that's
four combinations.

00:52:30.650 --> 00:52:33.160
Third bit can be 1 or zero
also -- that makes eight

00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:35.290
combinations of three bits.

00:52:35.290 --> 00:52:38.270
There are 2 to the 100th
combinations

00:52:38.270 --> 00:52:41.430
of 100 binary digits.

00:52:41.430 --> 00:52:45.830
So a theoretician says fine,
I'm at those 2 to the 100th

00:52:45.830 --> 00:52:50.120
different combinations of binary
digits into evenly

00:52:50.120 --> 00:52:55.500
spaced numbers between
zero and 1.

00:52:55.500 --> 00:52:58.810
Then I will take those evenly
spaced numbers between zero

00:52:58.810 --> 00:53:03.210
and 1 and I'll modulate some
wave form, whatever wave form

00:53:03.210 --> 00:53:07.120
I happen to choose, and I will
send that wave form.

00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:10.700
In the absence of noise, I pick
up that wave form and

00:53:10.700 --> 00:53:15.010
turn it back into my binary
sequence again.

00:53:15.010 --> 00:53:16.660
What's the conclusion
from this?

00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:22.700
The conclusion is if you don't
have noise there's no

00:53:22.700 --> 00:53:26.120
constraint on how much
data you can send.

00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:31.250
I can send as much data as I
want to, and there's nothing

00:53:31.250 --> 00:53:35.450
to stop me from doing it,
if I don't have noise.

00:53:35.450 --> 00:53:35.690
Yeah.

00:53:35.690 --> 00:53:38.666
AUDIENCE: So, is that
where something that

00:53:38.666 --> 00:53:40.155
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] basically
comes in.

00:53:40.155 --> 00:53:42.390
Like a difference between one
signal and the next signal.

00:53:42.390 --> 00:53:45.490
PROFESSOR: Somehow I have to
keep these things seperate.

00:53:45.490 --> 00:53:49.710
I don't necessarily have to
separate one binary digit from

00:53:49.710 --> 00:53:52.280
the next binary digit in time.

00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:56.730
I could, in fact, do something
like creating 2 to the 100th

00:53:56.730 --> 00:54:03.820
different wave forms or I could
do anything in between.

00:54:03.820 --> 00:54:08.290
I could take each sequence of
eight bits, turn them into 1

00:54:08.290 --> 00:54:13.540
of 256 wave forms, transmit one
wave form, then a little

00:54:13.540 --> 00:54:16.520
bit later transmit another
wave form and so forth.

00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:19.850
So I can split up the pie in any
way I want to, and we'll

00:54:19.850 --> 00:54:21.790
talk about that a
lot as we go on.

00:54:21.790 --> 00:54:24.610
Now, I split them up into
different wave forms, which I

00:54:24.610 --> 00:54:26.760
send at spaced times.

00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:30.210
I somehow have to worry about
the fact that if I send them

00:54:30.210 --> 00:54:35.750
over a finite bandwidth, there
is no way in hell that you can

00:54:35.750 --> 00:54:39.790
take finite bandwidth
wave forms and send

00:54:39.790 --> 00:54:42.270
them in finite time.

00:54:42.270 --> 00:54:47.680
Anything which lasts for a
finite amount of time spreads

00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:49.360
out in bandwidth.

00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:52.620
Anything which is in a finite
amount of bandwidth spreads

00:54:52.620 --> 00:54:53.540
out in time.

00:54:53.540 --> 00:54:56.090
That's what you ought
to know from 6.003.

00:54:56.090 --> 00:54:59.890
So we're dealing with an
unsoluble problem here.

00:54:59.890 --> 00:55:03.580
Well, Nyquist back in 1928
solved that problem.

00:55:03.580 --> 00:55:06.330
He said well no, you can't make
the wave form separate,

00:55:06.330 --> 00:55:10.000
but you can make the
sample separate.

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:12.670
People earlier had figured out
they could do that with the

00:55:12.670 --> 00:55:15.390
sampling theorem, but the
sampling theorem wasn't very

00:55:15.390 --> 00:55:19.300
practical, but Nyquist's way
of doing it was practical.

00:55:19.300 --> 00:55:22.350
So, in fact, you can separate
these wave forms.

00:55:22.350 --> 00:55:24.340
But you still have the
problem how do you

00:55:24.340 --> 00:55:25.590
deal with the noise.

00:55:27.710 --> 00:55:31.290
Well, one of the favorite ways
of dealing with noise is to

00:55:31.290 --> 00:55:35.510
assume that it's something
called white Gaussian noise.

00:55:35.510 --> 00:55:36.910
What is white Gaussian noise?

00:55:36.910 --> 00:55:42.400
White Gaussian noise is noise
which no matter where you look

00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:43.500
it's sitting there.

00:55:43.500 --> 00:55:44.990
You can't get away from it.

00:55:44.990 --> 00:55:47.940
You move around to different
frequencies, the noise is

00:55:47.940 --> 00:55:48.750
still there.

00:55:48.750 --> 00:55:51.960
You move around to different
times, it's still there.

00:55:51.960 --> 00:55:54.520
It is somehow uniformed
throughout time

00:55:54.520 --> 00:55:57.640
and throughout frequency.

00:55:57.640 --> 00:56:02.830
Kind of an awkward thing because
if I developed a

00:56:02.830 --> 00:56:07.830
receiver which didn't have any
bandwidth constraint on it,

00:56:07.830 --> 00:56:10.510
and I looked at this noise
coming in, which was spread

00:56:10.510 --> 00:56:14.040
out over all frequencies,
the noise would

00:56:14.040 --> 00:56:16.190
burn out the receiver.

00:56:16.190 --> 00:56:19.300
In other words, this white
Gaussian noise

00:56:19.300 --> 00:56:22.540
has infinite power.

00:56:22.540 --> 00:56:23.890
That shouldn't bother
you too much.

00:56:23.890 --> 00:56:26.610
You deal with unit impulses
all the time.

00:56:26.610 --> 00:56:30.310
A unit impulse has infinite
energy also.

00:56:30.310 --> 00:56:32.840
You probably never thought
about it because most

00:56:32.840 --> 00:56:36.380
undergraduate courses try very
hard to conceal that fact from

00:56:36.380 --> 00:56:39.530
you because they like to use
impulses for everything, but

00:56:39.530 --> 00:56:44.170
impulses have infinite energy
associated with them, and

00:56:44.170 --> 00:56:45.770
that's kind of a nasty thing.

00:56:45.770 --> 00:56:48.900
But anyway, we will deal with
the fact that impulses have

00:56:48.900 --> 00:56:51.720
infinite energy, and therefore,
not use them to

00:56:51.720 --> 00:56:53.050
transmit data.

00:56:53.050 --> 00:56:56.550
And we will deal with the fact
that this noise has infinite

00:56:56.550 --> 00:57:00.930
power, and find out how
to deal with that.

00:57:00.930 --> 00:57:04.440
And we will learn how to
understand the statistical

00:57:04.440 --> 00:57:06.620
structure of that noise.

00:57:06.620 --> 00:57:10.590
So we'll deal with all of these
things when we start

00:57:10.590 --> 00:57:13.190
studying these channels.

00:57:13.190 --> 00:57:16.820
As we do that we will find out
that no matter what you do on

00:57:16.820 --> 00:57:21.540
a channel like this, there are
some fundamental constraints

00:57:21.540 --> 00:57:24.540
on how much data can
be transmitted.

00:57:24.540 --> 00:57:27.190
I can take you through a
little bit of a thought

00:57:27.190 --> 00:57:32.230
experiment which will sort
of explain that, I think.

00:57:32.230 --> 00:57:36.150
It's partly what we were just
starting to say over here.

00:57:36.150 --> 00:57:42.460
A simple-minded way to look at
this problem is I have binary

00:57:42.460 --> 00:57:44.960
digits coming in.

00:57:44.960 --> 00:57:51.690
I take these binary digits and
I separate them into shorts

00:57:51.690 --> 00:57:55.390
sequences of m binary
digits each.

00:57:55.390 --> 00:57:58.640
So, I take the first m binary
digits, then I take the next m

00:57:58.640 --> 00:58:03.540
binary digits, and the next m
binary digits and so forth.

00:58:03.540 --> 00:58:08.240
A sequence of m binary digits,
there are 2 to the m

00:58:08.240 --> 00:58:09.960
combinations of this.

00:58:09.960 --> 00:58:15.310
So I map these 2 to the m
combinations into one of 2 to

00:58:15.310 --> 00:58:17.950
the m different numbers.

00:58:17.950 --> 00:58:20.190
Now, you look at this noise
and you say I have to keep

00:58:20.190 --> 00:58:24.260
some separation between
these numbers.

00:58:24.260 --> 00:58:27.230
So, with a separation between
the numbers, say the

00:58:27.230 --> 00:58:31.170
separation is 1, let this
define the number 1.

00:58:31.170 --> 00:58:35.580
That's something we
theoreticians do all the time.

00:58:35.580 --> 00:58:39.020
So I have 2 to the m
different levels.

00:58:39.020 --> 00:58:41.890
I have to send this in
a certain bandwidth.

00:58:41.890 --> 00:58:45.270
The sampling theorem says I
can't send things that are

00:58:45.270 --> 00:58:49.150
more than twice the bandwidth
of this system, so I have a

00:58:49.150 --> 00:58:51.750
bandwidth of 2w.

00:58:51.750 --> 00:58:59.100
I can send m binary digits
in this bandwidth, w.

00:58:59.100 --> 00:59:01.580
Therefore, I can send bits
at a certain rate.

00:59:01.580 --> 00:59:04.540
This is all very crude but it's
going to lead us to an

00:59:04.540 --> 00:59:07.000
interesting trade-off.

00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:10.910
I can increase m and by
increasing m I can get by with

00:59:10.910 --> 00:59:17.210
a smaller bandwidth, because I
have these symbols, these m

00:59:17.210 --> 00:59:20.760
bit symbols coming along
at a slower rate.

00:59:20.760 --> 00:59:24.490
So by increasing m, I can
decrease the bandwidth, by

00:59:24.490 --> 00:59:28.590
increasing m, I can reduce the
bandwidth, but by reducing the

00:59:28.590 --> 00:59:33.990
bandwidth, the power
is going up.

00:59:33.990 --> 00:59:38.070
You can see that as I change
m, the power is going up

00:59:38.070 --> 00:59:41.700
exponentially with m.

00:59:41.700 --> 00:59:47.590
In other words, the trade-off
between bandwidth and power is

00:59:47.590 --> 00:59:50.390
kind of nasty in this
simple-minded picture.

00:59:54.320 --> 01:00:01.570
Let me jump ahead.

01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:09.080
For this added of white
Gaussian noise with a

01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:14.510
bandwidth constraint, Shannon
showed that the capacity was w

01:00:14.510 --> 01:00:19.300
times log of 1 plus the power in
the system times the noise

01:00:19.300 --> 01:00:21.470
power times w.

01:00:21.470 --> 01:00:25.410
Now, I don't expect you to
understand this formula now,

01:00:25.410 --> 01:00:28.520
and there's a lot of very tricky
and somewhat confusing

01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:30.410
things about it.

01:00:30.410 --> 01:00:34.320
One thing is that the power and
the noise is going up with

01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:35.910
the bandwidth that you're
looking at.

01:00:35.910 --> 01:00:39.170
Because I said the bandwidth is
everywhere, you can't avoid

01:00:39.170 --> 01:00:44.710
it, and therefore, if you use a
wider bandwidth system, you

01:00:44.710 --> 01:00:46.870
get more noise coming into it.

01:00:46.870 --> 01:00:48.770
If you have a certain amount of
power that you're willing

01:00:48.770 --> 01:00:53.860
to transmit and a certain
amount of noise, and the

01:00:53.860 --> 01:00:56.060
number of bits per second
you can transmit is

01:00:56.060 --> 01:00:59.200
going up with w.

01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:03.690
But look at this affect with p
here, the effect with p is

01:01:03.690 --> 01:01:07.520
logarithmic, which says as I
increase this parameter m and

01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:12.770
I put more and more bits into
one symbol, this quantity is

01:01:12.770 --> 01:01:17.430
going up exponentially, which
means the logarithm of this is

01:01:17.430 --> 01:01:23.760
going up just linearly with m.

01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:27.230
This gives you, if you look
at it carefully, the same

01:01:27.230 --> 01:01:32.380
trade-off as the simple-minded
example I was talking about.

01:01:32.380 --> 01:01:34.530
That simple-minded example
does not explain

01:01:34.530 --> 01:01:35.770
this formula at all.

01:01:35.770 --> 01:01:38.370
This formula's rather deep.

01:01:38.370 --> 01:01:39.760
We probably won't
even completely

01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:41.990
have proven this term.

01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:46.420
What Shannon's results says is
that no matter what you do, no

01:01:46.420 --> 01:01:50.160
matter how clever you are with
this noise that exists

01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:55.270
everywhere, the fastest you
can transmit with the most

01:01:55.270 --> 01:02:00.640
sophisticated coding schemes you
can think of is this rate

01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:04.380
right here, which is what you
would think it might be just

01:02:04.380 --> 01:02:09.540
from the scaling in terms of w
and m, where when you increase

01:02:09.540 --> 01:02:11.960
m the power goes up
exponentially.

01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:15.420
It's the same kind of answer
you get with that simple

01:02:15.420 --> 01:02:17.010
thought experiment.

01:02:17.010 --> 01:02:19.820
The fact that you have a 1 in
here is a little bit strange,

01:02:19.820 --> 01:02:23.070
and we'll find out where
that comes from.

01:02:23.070 --> 01:02:26.610
The idea here is that
this noise is

01:02:26.610 --> 01:02:28.040
something you can't beat.

01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:29.480
The noise is fundamental.

01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:33.330
It's a fundamental part of every
communication system.

01:02:33.330 --> 01:02:38.130
As I always like to say, noise
is like death and taxes, you

01:02:38.130 --> 01:02:41.960
can't avoid them, they're there,
and there's nothing you

01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:43.160
can do about them.

01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:46.220
Like death and taxes, you can
take care of yourself and live

01:02:46.220 --> 01:02:51.750
longer, and with taxes, well,
you can become wealthy and

01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:55.030
support the government and make
all sorts of payments and

01:02:55.030 --> 01:02:57.680
reduce your taxes that way.

01:02:57.680 --> 01:03:00.180
Or you can hire a
good accountant.

01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:02.380
So you can do things
there also.

01:03:02.380 --> 01:03:05.860
But those things are
still always there.

01:03:05.860 --> 01:03:08.960
So you're always stuck
with this.

01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:12.650
One of the major parts of the
course will be to understand

01:03:12.650 --> 01:03:16.600
what this noise is in a
much deeper context

01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:19.020
than we would otherwise.

01:03:19.020 --> 01:03:21.880
So, I'll save that and come
back to it later.

01:03:25.660 --> 01:03:33.085
We have the same kind of
layering in channel encoding.

01:03:33.085 --> 01:03:36.850
When I talk about channeling
encoding, I'm not talking

01:03:36.850 --> 01:03:40.510
about any kind of complicated
coding technique.

01:03:40.510 --> 01:03:44.270
6.451 talks about
all of those.

01:03:44.270 --> 01:03:47.380
What I'm talking about is simply
the question of how do

01:03:47.380 --> 01:03:51.040
you take a sequence of bits,
turn it into a sequence of

01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:56.170
wave forms in such a way that
at the receiver we can take

01:03:56.170 --> 01:03:59.890
that sequence of wave forms and
match them reliabily back

01:03:59.890 --> 01:04:02.170
into the original bits.

01:04:02.170 --> 01:04:05.850
There's a standard way of doing
this, which is to take

01:04:05.850 --> 01:04:08.620
the sequence of bits,
first send them

01:04:08.620 --> 01:04:10.690
through a discrete decoder.

01:04:10.690 --> 01:04:14.170
What the discrete encoder
code will do is

01:04:14.170 --> 01:04:17.895
something like this.

01:04:17.895 --> 01:04:22.080
And match bits at one rate into
bits at a higher rate,

01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:24.250
and this let's you correct
channel errors.

01:04:24.250 --> 01:04:28.530
A simple example of this is
you match zero into zero,

01:04:28.530 --> 01:04:29.720
zero, zero.

01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:32.380
1 into 1, 1, 1.

01:04:32.380 --> 01:04:37.670
If the rest of your system,
namely, if this part of the

01:04:37.670 --> 01:04:43.280
system makes a single error at
some point, this part of the

01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:47.750
system escapes from it.

01:04:47.750 --> 01:04:51.200
I sort of put these on one
slide but I couldn't.

01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:56.060
This takes a single zero, turns
it into three zeros.

01:04:56.060 --> 01:05:00.590
These three zeros go into this
modulator, which maps this

01:05:00.590 --> 01:05:05.330
into some wave from responsive
to these three zeros.

01:05:05.330 --> 01:05:08.140
Wave form goes through here,
noise gets added, the

01:05:08.140 --> 01:05:12.930
modulator, the text, those
binary digits, comes out with

01:05:12.930 --> 01:05:15.840
some approximation to
these three zeros.

01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:19.780
Every once in awhile because
of the noise, one of these

01:05:19.780 --> 01:05:24.100
bits comes out wrong, and
because they come out wrong

01:05:24.100 --> 01:05:29.910
this discrete decoder says
ah-ha, I know that what was

01:05:29.910 --> 01:05:34.430
sent/put in was either zero,
zero, zero or 1, 1, 1.

01:05:34.430 --> 01:05:38.120
It's more likely to have one
error than to have two errors,

01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:40.780
and therefore, any time
one error occurs I

01:05:40.780 --> 01:05:43.760
can decode it correctly.

01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:49.000
Now, that is a miserable code.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:54.100
A guy by the name of Hamming
became very famous for

01:05:54.100 --> 01:05:58.300
generalizing this just a little
bit into another single

01:05:58.300 --> 01:06:02.230
error correcting code, which
came through at a slightly

01:06:02.230 --> 01:06:05.740
higher rate but still corrected
single errors.

01:06:05.740 --> 01:06:09.290
He became inordinately famous
because he was a tireless

01:06:09.290 --> 01:06:14.220
self-promoter and people think
that he was the person who

01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:17.290
invented error correction
coding.

01:06:17.290 --> 01:06:19.040
He really wasn't.

01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:21.770
And his heirs will probably --

01:06:21.770 --> 01:06:24.210
I don't know.

01:06:24.210 --> 01:06:32.270
Anyway, coding of this type,
namely mapping binary digits

01:06:32.270 --> 01:06:36.300
into longer strings of binary
digits in such a way that you

01:06:36.300 --> 01:06:42.450
can correct binary errors, has
always been a major part of

01:06:42.450 --> 01:06:45.580
communication system research.

01:06:45.580 --> 01:06:49.790
A large number of communication
systems work in

01:06:49.790 --> 01:06:51.630
exactly this way.

01:06:51.630 --> 01:06:55.750
In fact, the older systems which
use coding tended to

01:06:55.750 --> 01:06:57.220
work this way.

01:06:57.220 --> 01:07:00.960
This was a very popular way of
trying to design system.

01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:04.940
You would put a total layering
across here.

01:07:04.940 --> 01:07:08.040
Namely, this part of the system
didn't know that there

01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:11.540
was any coding going on here.

01:07:11.540 --> 01:07:15.490
At this point where you're doing
discrete decoding, you

01:07:15.490 --> 01:07:18.675
don't know anything about what
the detector is doing here.

01:07:18.675 --> 01:07:22.100
It doesn't take a lot of
imagination to say if you have

01:07:22.100 --> 01:07:26.900
a detector here and there's this
symbol that comes through

01:07:26.900 --> 01:07:30.830
here, noise gets added to it,
you're trying to decode this

01:07:30.830 --> 01:07:33.890
symbol, and there's this
Gaussian noise, which is just

01:07:33.890 --> 01:07:37.810
sort of spread around,
it's concentrated.

01:07:37.810 --> 01:07:43.960
Usually when errors occur,
errors occur just barely.

01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:47.990
What you see at this point is
you almost flip a coin to

01:07:47.990 --> 01:07:52.870
decide whether a zero or a 1 was
transmitted at this point.

01:07:52.870 --> 01:07:57.470
If this poor guy had that
information, this poor guy

01:07:57.470 --> 01:08:00.030
could work much, much better.

01:08:00.030 --> 01:08:02.440
Namely, this guy could correct
double errors instead of

01:08:02.440 --> 01:08:05.500
single errors, because if one
bit came through with a clear

01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:09.050
indication that that's what it
was, and the other two bits

01:08:09.050 --> 01:08:11.930
came through saying well, I
can't really tell what these

01:08:11.930 --> 01:08:15.380
are, then this guy could
correct two errors

01:08:15.380 --> 01:08:17.260
instead of one error.

01:08:17.260 --> 01:08:21.980
So this is a good example where
this layering in here is

01:08:21.980 --> 01:08:24.680
really a rotten idea.

01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:29.300
Most modern systems don't
do that strict layering.

01:08:29.300 --> 01:08:34.560
But a whole lot of modern
systems do, in fact, do this

01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:39.080
binary encoding here and they
use the principles that came

01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:44.210
out of the binary encoding
from a long time ago.

01:08:44.210 --> 01:08:47.320
The only extra thing they do
here is they use this extra

01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:50.180
information from the
demodulator.

01:08:50.180 --> 01:08:52.400
This is something called
soft decoding

01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:54.040
instead of hard decoding.

01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:57.270
In other words, what comes out
of the demodulator is soft

01:08:57.270 --> 01:09:01.820
decisions, and soft decisions
say well, I think it was this

01:09:01.820 --> 01:09:06.900
but I'm not sure or I am
sure and so forth.

01:09:06.900 --> 01:09:09.160
There's a whole range
of graduations.

01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:12.470
We will study detection theory
and we'll understand how that

01:09:12.470 --> 01:09:16.120
works and we'll understand how
you use those soft decisions

01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:22.200
and all of that stuff and
it's kind of neat.

01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:27.120
The modulation part of this is
what maps bit sequences into

01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:28.850
wave forms.

01:09:28.850 --> 01:09:32.660
When we map bit sequences into
wave form, there's this very

01:09:32.660 --> 01:09:33.800
simple idea.

01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:38.940
If I take a single bit that's
either zero or 1, I map a zero

01:09:38.940 --> 01:09:44.120
into one wave form, I map a 1
into another wave form, I send

01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:47.920
either wave form a
or wave form b.

01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:50.820
I somehow want to make those
wave forms as different from

01:09:50.820 --> 01:09:53.850
each other as I can.

01:09:53.850 --> 01:09:58.370
Now, what do you mean by making
wave forms different?

01:09:58.370 --> 01:10:01.830
I know what it means to make
numbers different.

01:10:01.830 --> 01:10:06.425
I know that zero and 3
are more different

01:10:06.425 --> 01:10:08.120
than zero and 2 are.

01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:11.200
Namely, I have a good measure
of distance for

01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:13.490
a sequence of numbers.

01:10:13.490 --> 01:10:16.540
One of the things that we have
to deal with is how do you

01:10:16.540 --> 01:10:22.680
find an appropriate measure of
distance for wave forms.

01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:26.010
When I find the measure of
distance for wave forms, what

01:10:26.010 --> 01:10:29.230
do I want to make it
responsive to?

01:10:29.230 --> 01:10:32.440
What I'm trying to do is to
overcome this noise, and

01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:35.210
therefore, I have to find the
measure of distance which is

01:10:35.210 --> 01:10:39.450
appropriate for what the
noise is doing to me.

01:10:39.450 --> 01:10:41.930
Well that's why we have to study
wave forms as much as we

01:10:41.930 --> 01:10:43.850
do in this course.

01:10:43.850 --> 01:10:48.090
What we will find is that you
can treat wave forms in the

01:10:48.090 --> 01:10:51.290
same way as you can treat
sequences of numbers.

01:10:51.290 --> 01:10:54.720
We will find that there's a
vector space associated with

01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:59.040
wave forms, which is exactly
the same as a vector space

01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:04.130
associated with infinite
sequences of numbers.

01:11:04.130 --> 01:11:08.750
It's almost the same as the
vector space associated with

01:11:08.750 --> 01:11:12.070
finite sequences of wave form,
and that vector space

01:11:12.070 --> 01:11:20.950
associated with a finite
sequence of numbers is exactly

01:11:20.950 --> 01:11:24.420
the vector space that you've
been looking at all of your

01:11:24.420 --> 01:11:27.510
lives, and which you use
primarily as a notational

01:11:27.510 --> 01:11:31.520
convenience to talk about
a sequence of numbers.

01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:35.060
What's the distance that
you use there?

01:11:35.060 --> 01:11:37.560
Well, you take the difference
between each number in the

01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:41.170
sequence, you square it, you
add it up and you take the

01:11:41.170 --> 01:11:42.550
square root of it.

01:11:42.550 --> 01:11:44.350
Namely, you look at the
energy difference

01:11:44.350 --> 01:11:46.310
between these sequences.

01:11:46.310 --> 01:11:49.260
What we will find remarkably
is when we do things right,

01:11:49.260 --> 01:11:53.630
the appropriate distance to talk
about on wave forms, is

01:11:53.630 --> 01:11:55.810
exactly what comes from the

01:11:55.810 --> 01:11:58.460
appropriate looking at sequences.

01:11:58.460 --> 01:12:01.730
In fact, we'll take wave forms
and break them into sequences.

01:12:01.730 --> 01:12:07.530
That's a major part of this
modulation process.

01:12:07.530 --> 01:12:10.100
You think of that in terms
of the sampling theorem.

01:12:10.100 --> 01:12:14.250
Namely, you take a bunch of
numbers, you take each number

01:12:14.250 --> 01:12:18.780
in the sampling theorem and you
put a little sin x over x

01:12:18.780 --> 01:12:23.790
hat around it and you transmit
that, and then you add up all

01:12:23.790 --> 01:12:27.370
of these different samples,
which is a sequence of

01:12:27.370 --> 01:12:31.520
numbers, each of them with these
little sin x over x caps

01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:32.630
around them.

01:12:32.630 --> 01:12:36.520
The neat thing about the sin x
over x caps around them is

01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:38.200
they all go to zero
with these sample

01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:42.650
points and it all works.

01:12:42.650 --> 01:12:45.570
Therefore, the sequences
look almost the

01:12:45.570 --> 01:12:47.500
same as a wave form.

01:12:47.500 --> 01:12:50.800
We'll find out that that
works in general, so we

01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:53.190
will do most of that.

01:12:53.190 --> 01:12:56.970
Modern practice often combines
all these layers into what's

01:12:56.970 --> 01:12:58.530
called coding modulation.

01:12:58.530 --> 01:13:01.460
In other words, they go further
than just this idea of

01:13:01.460 --> 01:13:06.180
soft decisions, and actually
treat the problem in general

01:13:06.180 --> 01:13:10.130
of what do you do with bits
coming into a sequence, into a

01:13:10.130 --> 01:13:13.490
system, how do you turn those
into wave forms that can be

01:13:13.490 --> 01:13:15.690
dealt with an appropriate way.

01:13:15.690 --> 01:13:19.180
And we'll talk just a little
bit about that and mostly

01:13:19.180 --> 01:13:25.520
6.451 talks about that.

01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:28.070
I want to talk a little bit
right at the end, I'm almost

01:13:28.070 --> 01:13:34.920
finished, about computational
complexity in these

01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:39.190
communication systems that we're
trying to worry about.

01:13:39.190 --> 01:13:43.730
One of the things that you will
become curious about as

01:13:43.730 --> 01:13:49.350
we move along is that we are
sometimes suggesting doing

01:13:49.350 --> 01:13:53.750
things in ways that
look very complex.

01:13:53.750 --> 01:13:57.820
The word complex is an
extraordinarily complex word.

01:13:57.820 --> 01:14:00.890
None of us know what it means
because it means so many

01:14:00.890 --> 01:14:03.600
different things.

01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:06.610
I was saying that these
telephone systems are

01:14:06.610 --> 01:14:08.980
inordinately complex.

01:14:08.980 --> 01:14:13.770
In a sense they aren't because
they have an incredible number

01:14:13.770 --> 01:14:16.780
of pieces, all of which
are the same.

01:14:16.780 --> 01:14:19.930
So you can understand a
telephone system in terms of

01:14:19.930 --> 01:14:23.530
understanding a relatively small
number of principles.

01:14:23.530 --> 01:14:26.590
You can understand these
Gaussian channels in terms of

01:14:26.590 --> 01:14:30.110
understanding a small number
of principles.

01:14:30.110 --> 01:14:32.680
So they're complex if you don't
know how to look at

01:14:32.680 --> 01:14:36.090
them, they're simple if you do
know how to look at them.

01:14:36.090 --> 01:14:41.260
Here what I'm talking about is
how many chips do you need to

01:14:41.260 --> 01:14:43.240
build something?

01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:45.520
How complicated are
those chips?

01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:49.870
Fundamentally, how much does it
cost to build the system?

01:14:49.870 --> 01:14:52.920
Well, one of the curious things
and one of the things

01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:57.740
that has made information theory
so popular in designing

01:14:57.740 --> 01:15:02.130
communication systems is that
we're almost at the point

01:15:02.130 --> 01:15:06.060
where chips are free.

01:15:06.060 --> 01:15:08.860
Now, what does that mean?

01:15:08.860 --> 01:15:12.200
It means if you want to do
something more complicated it

01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:13.780
hardly costs anything.

01:15:13.780 --> 01:15:15.110
This is sort of Moore's law.

01:15:15.110 --> 01:15:19.400
Moore's law says every year
you can put more and more

01:15:19.400 --> 01:15:22.780
stuff on a single chip.

01:15:22.780 --> 01:15:26.540
You can do this cheaply and
the chips work faster and

01:15:26.540 --> 01:15:30.150
faster so you can do more and
more complicated things very,

01:15:30.150 --> 01:15:31.160
very easily.

01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:33.580
There are some caveats.

01:15:33.580 --> 01:15:39.240
Low cost with high complexity
requires large volume.

01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:42.380
In other words, it takes a very
long time to design a

01:15:42.380 --> 01:15:47.110
chip, it takes an enormous
amount of lead time --

01:15:47.110 --> 01:15:50.740
I mean we're not going to study
these details in the

01:15:50.740 --> 01:15:54.220
course, but I want you to be
aware of why it is that in a

01:15:54.220 --> 01:15:57.430
sense complexity doesn't
matter anymore.

01:15:57.430 --> 01:16:00.380
If you spend a long enough time
designing it and you can

01:16:00.380 --> 01:16:04.130
produce enough of them, you can
do extraordinarily complex

01:16:04.130 --> 01:16:06.330
things very, very cheaply.

01:16:06.330 --> 01:16:09.000
I mean you see this with
all the cellular

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.030
phones that you buy.

01:16:11.030 --> 01:16:14.830
I mean cellular phones now are
actually give-away devices.

01:16:14.830 --> 01:16:18.010
You look at them to see what's
in them and they're

01:16:18.010 --> 01:16:20.370
inordinately complicated.

01:16:20.370 --> 01:16:23.260
You buy a personal computer
today and it's 1,000 times

01:16:23.260 --> 01:16:25.770
more powerful than the biggest
computers in the

01:16:25.770 --> 01:16:28.590
world 30 years ago.

01:16:28.590 --> 01:16:33.170
You can do everything
more cheaply now

01:16:33.170 --> 01:16:34.740
than you could before.

01:16:34.740 --> 01:16:37.560
What's the hitch?

01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:40.970
Well, you see the hitch when
you program a computer,

01:16:40.970 --> 01:16:45.670
namely, if you look at word
processing languages, yes,

01:16:45.670 --> 01:16:51.520
they become bigger and bigger
every year, they become more

01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:54.570
and more complex, they will
do more and more things.

01:16:54.570 --> 01:16:58.670
As far as their function of word
processing, some of us

01:16:58.670 --> 01:17:01.900
think there have been advances
in the last 30 years.

01:17:01.900 --> 01:17:05.870
Others, like myself, feel that
there have not been advances

01:17:05.870 --> 01:17:09.690
and, in fact, we're
going backwards.

01:17:09.690 --> 01:17:13.360
The problem is we have so much
complexity we don't know how

01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:15.410
to deal with it anymore.

01:17:15.410 --> 01:17:18.190
Most of us have become
blinking 12's.

01:17:18.190 --> 01:17:19.670
You know what a blinking
12 is.

01:17:19.670 --> 01:17:22.250
It's all of the electronic
equipment you have in your

01:17:22.250 --> 01:17:25.760
home, whenever you don't program
it right you see a 12

01:17:25.760 --> 01:17:29.315
blinking on and off, which is
where the clock is and the

01:17:29.315 --> 01:17:31.550
clock hasn't been set,
and therefore,

01:17:31.550 --> 01:17:33.890
it's blinking at you.

01:17:33.890 --> 01:17:36.690
Most people who have complicated
devices, whether

01:17:36.690 --> 01:17:40.620
they're audio devices or what
have you, are using less than

01:17:40.620 --> 01:17:43.900
one percent of the fancy
features in them.

01:17:43.900 --> 01:17:47.100
You spend hours and hours trying
to bring that from one

01:17:47.100 --> 01:17:48.350
percent up to two percent.

01:17:51.230 --> 01:17:57.050
So that the cost of complexity
is not in what you can build,

01:17:57.050 --> 01:18:01.180
but it's in this conceptual
complexity.

01:18:01.180 --> 01:18:04.500
If you design an algorithm and
you understand the algorithm,

01:18:04.500 --> 01:18:08.230
it hardly makes any difference
how complicated it is, unless

01:18:08.230 --> 01:18:11.440
the complexity is going up
exponentially with something.

01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:13.880
That's the first caveat.

01:18:13.880 --> 01:18:15.680
It's actually the second
caveat, too.

01:18:15.680 --> 01:18:19.050
Complex systems are often not
well thought through.

01:18:19.050 --> 01:18:22.790
They often don't work
or are not robust.

01:18:22.790 --> 01:18:25.620
The non-robustness is the
worst part of it.

01:18:25.620 --> 01:18:30.040
The third caveat is when you
have special applications.

01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:32.920
Since they involve small
numbers, you're not going to

01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:36.660
build a lot of them, it takes
a long time to design them.

01:18:36.660 --> 01:18:39.900
The only way you can build
special applications is to

01:18:39.900 --> 01:18:43.780
make them minor modifications of
other things that have been

01:18:43.780 --> 01:18:45.920
done before.

01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:48.800
So this question of how
complicated the systems we can

01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:50.760
build are, if you can
make enough of

01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:52.610
them they become cheap.

01:18:52.610 --> 01:18:56.090
If you have enough lead time
they become cheap.

01:18:56.090 --> 01:18:59.300
Which says that this layering
of communication system that

01:18:59.300 --> 01:19:03.130
we're talking about really
ultimately makes sense.

01:19:03.130 --> 01:19:05.800
Starting next time, we're going
to start talking about

01:19:05.800 --> 01:19:09.090
this first part of source
coding, which is the discrete

01:19:09.090 --> 01:19:10.340
part of source coding.

01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:17.150
We will have those notes
on the web shortly.

01:19:17.150 --> 01:19:18.870
You can look ahead at
them, if you would

01:19:18.870 --> 01:19:21.250
like to, before Monday.

01:19:21.250 --> 01:19:26.190
Please review the probability
that you are supposed to know

01:19:26.190 --> 01:19:27.640
because you will need
it very shortly.

01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:28.890
Thanks.
