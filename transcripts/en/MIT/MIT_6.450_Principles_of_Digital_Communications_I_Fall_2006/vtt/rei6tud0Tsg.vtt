00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.160
PROFESSOR: To take up the topic
of quantization, you

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.990
remember we're talking about
source coding in the first

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.900
part of the course, channel
coding in the

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.700
last 2/3 of the course.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:39.980
Source coding, like all, is
divided into three parts.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.980
If you have waveforms, such
as speech, you start

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.400
out with the waveform.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.810
The typical way to encode
waveforms is you first either

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.750
sample the waveform or
you expand it in

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.910
some kind of expansion.

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.720
When you do that, you wind up
with a sequence of numbers.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.850
You put the sequence of numbers
into a quantizer, and

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.270
the quantizer reduces that
to a discrete alphabet.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.500
You put the discrete symbols
into the discrete encoder.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.490
You pass it through a reliable
binary channel.

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.140
What is a reliable
binary channel?

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.220
It's a layered view of any old
channel in the world, OK?

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.110
In other words, the way that
discrete channels work these

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.910
days is that, in almost all
cases, what goes into them is

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:38.450
a binary stream of signals, and
what comes out of them is

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.320
a binary stream of symbols, and
the output is essentially

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.630
the same z-input.

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.710
That's the whole purpose of
how you design digital

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.690
channels, and they work
over analog media and

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.220
all sorts of things.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:01.400
OK, so discrete encoders and
discrete decoders are really a

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.610
valid topic to study
in their own.

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.190
I mean, you have text and stuff
like that, which is

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.030
discrete to start with, so
there's a general topic of how

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.990
do you encode discrete things?

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.860
We've pretty much answered that
problem, at least in an

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:27.230
abstract sense, and the main
point there is you find the

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.700
entropy of that discrete
sequence, the entropy per

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.380
symbol, and then you find ways
of encoding that discrete

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.120
source in such a way that the
number of bits per symbol is

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.400
approximately equal
to that entropy.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.140
We know you can't do any
better than that.

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.390
You can't do an encoding, which
is uniquely decodable,

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.930
which you can get out of with
the original symbols again,

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.540
with anything less
than the entropy.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.210
So at least we know roughly what
the answer to that is.

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:06.150
We even know some classy schemes
like the Lempel-Ziv

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.900
algorithm, which will in fact
operate without even knowing

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.910
anything about what the
probabilities are.

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.750
So we sort of understand this
block here at this point.

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.390
And we could start with this
next, or we could start with

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:28.570
this next, and unlike the
electrician here, we're going

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:34.120
to move in sequence and look at
this next and this third.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.480
There's another reason
for that.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.690
When we get into this question,
we will be talking

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.550
about what do you do
with waveforms?

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:45.820
How do you deal with
waveforms?

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.850
It's what you've been studying
probably since the sixth

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:53.670
grade, and you're all
familiar with it.

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.770
You do integration and
things like that.

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:58.240
You know how to work
with functions.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.300
What we're going to do with
functions in this course is a

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.070
little bit different than
what you're used to.

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:07.010
It's quite a bit different than
what you learned in your

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.500
Signals and Systems course, and
you'll find out why as we

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.820
move along.

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:17.310
But we have to understand this
business of how to deal with

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:22.350
waveforms, both in terms of this
block, which is the final

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.010
block we'll study in source
coding, and also in terms of

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.780
how to deal with channels
because in real channels,

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.870
generally what you transmit
is a waveform.

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.920
What the noise does to you is to
add a waveform or, in some

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:40.040
sense, multiply what you put
in by something else.

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.650
And all of that is
waveform stuff.

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.440
And all of information theory
and all of digital

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.610
communication is based
on thinking bits.

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.860
So somehow or other, we have to
become very facile in going

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.530
from waveforms to bits.

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.560
Now I've been around the
professional communities of

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.160
both communication and
information theory for

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.790
a long, long time.

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:10.150
There is one fundamental problem
that gives everyone

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.170
problems because information
theory texts do not deal with

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:17.250
it and communication texts
do not deal with it.

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.960
And that problem is how do you
go from one to the other,

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.430
which seems like it ought
to be an easy thing.

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:25.820
It's not as easy as it looks,
and therefore, we're going to

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.930
spent quite a bit
of time on that.

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.140
In fact, I passed out lectures
6 and 7 today, which in

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:36.150
previous years I've done in two
separate lectures because

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:39.420
quantization is a problem
that looks important.

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:43.800
We'll see that it's not quite
as important as it looks.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:49.180
And I guess the other thing is,
I mean, at different times

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:52.490
you have to teach different
things or you get stale on it.

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:56.220
And I've just finished writing
some fairly nice notes, I

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.530
think, on this question of how
do you go from waveforms to

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:03.080
numbers and how do you go from
numbers to waveforms.

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.190
And I want to spend a little
more time on that this year

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:07.920
than I did last year.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:10.730
I want to spend, therefore,
a little less time on

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:15.910
quantization, so that next time,
we will briefly review

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:20.560
what we've done today on
quantization, but we will

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.310
essentially just compress
those two

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:25.980
lectures all into one.

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:30.310
In dealing with waveforms,
we're going to learn some

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:33.090
interesting and kind
of cool things.

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:36.180
Like for those of you who
really don't -- are not

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:40.380
interested in mathematics, you
know that people study things

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:43.920
like the theory of real
variables and functional

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:50.070
analysis and all of these neat
things, which are very, in a

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:52.870
sense, advanced mathematics.

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:56.920
They're all based on measure
theory, and you're going to

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.810
find out a little bit about
measure theory here.

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:03.380
Not an awful lot, but just
enough to know why one has to

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:07.220
deal with those questions
because the major results in

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:12.160
dealing with waveforms and
samples really can't be stated

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.560
in any other form than
in a somewhat

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.820
measure-theoretic form.

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:20.740
So we're going to find just
enough about that so we can

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:22.880
understand what those
issues are about.

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.610
So that's why next time we're
going to start dealing with

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:27.930
the waveform issues.

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:31.990
OK, so today, we're dealing with
these quantizer issues

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:36.630
and how do you take a sequence
of numbers, turn them into a

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:39.220
sequence of symbols
at the other end?

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:41.450
How do you take a sequence
of symbols, turn

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:43.110
them back into numbers?

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:59.890
So when you convert real numbers
to binary strings, you

00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:03.360
need a mapping from the
set of real numbers

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.470
to a discrete alphabet.

00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:08.520
And we're typically going to
have a mapping from the set of

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:12.700
real numbers into a finite
discrete alphabet.

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:16.790
Now what's the first obvious
thing that you notice when you

00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:20.280
have a mapping that goes from an
infinite set of things into

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:21.620
a finite set of things?

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:23.270
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:23.550
PROFESSOR: What?

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:25.020
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:29.820
PROFESSOR: Not really.

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:34.010
It's a much simpler
idea than that.

00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:36.630
How are you going to get back?

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:40.580
I mean, usually when you map
something into something else,

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:43.590
you would like to
get back again.

00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:46.870
When you map an infinite set
into a finite set, how are you

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:47.590
going to get back?

00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:50.670
AUDIENCE: You're not.

00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:51.170
PROFESSOR: You're not.

00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:52.190
Good!

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:54.330
There's not any way in hell
that you're ever going

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:56.160
to get back, OK?

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.780
So, in other words, what
you've done here is to

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:03.770
deliberately introduce some
distortion into the picture.

00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:07.210
You've introduced distortion
because you have no choice.

00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:11.930
If you want to turn numbers into
bits, you can't get back

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:13.460
to the exact numbers again.

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:16.650
So you can only get back to some
approximation of what the

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:18.020
numbers are.

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:21.250
But anyway, this process of
doing this is called scalar

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:24.690
quantization, if we're mapping
from the set of real numbers

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:27.410
to a discrete alphabet.

00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:34.680
If instead you want to convert
real n-tuples into sequences

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:39.120
of discrete symbols, in other
words, into a finite alphabet,

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:42.330
you call that vector
quantization because you can

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:46.760
view n real numbers, a sequence
of n real numbers as

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:50.990
a vector within coordinates
and within components.

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:53.660
And I'm not doing anything
fancy with vectors here.

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:57.490
You just look at an n-tuple
of numbers as a vector.

00:09:57.490 --> 00:10:02.420
OK, so scalar quantization is
going to encode each term of

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:06.290
the source sequence
separately.

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:12.040
And vector quantization is first
going to segment this

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:18.600
sequence of numbers into blocks
of n numbers each, and

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:23.610
then it's going to find a way
of encoding those n-blocks

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:25.540
into discrete symbols.

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:28.000
Does this sound a little bit
like what we've already done

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.150
in dealing with discrete
sources?

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:33.350
Yeah, it's exactly
the same thing.

00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:37.430
I mean, we started out by
mapping individual symbols

00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:42.950
into bit sequences, and then we
said, gee, we can also map

00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:47.830
n-blocks of those symbols into
bits, and we said, gee, this

00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:49.230
is the same problem again.

00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:52.760
There's nothing different,
nothing new.

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:57.660
And it's the same thing here
almost except here the

00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:00.780
properties of the real numbers
are important.

00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:03.200
Why are the properties of the
real numbers important?

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:06.570
Why can't we just look
at this as symbols?

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:10.210
Well, because, since we can't
do this mapping in an

00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:14.490
invertable way, you have to deal
with the fact that you

00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:16.520
have distortion here.

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:18.160
There's no other way
to think about it.

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:19.960
There is distortion.

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:21.180
You might as well face it.

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:24.110
If you try to cover it
up, it just comes

00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:26.110
up to kick you later.

00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:30.760
So we face it right in the
beginning, and that's why we

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:32.630
deal with these things
as numbers.

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:38.380
So let's look at a simple
example of what a scalar

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:42.090
quantizer is going to do.

00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:50.240
Basically, what we have to do
is to map the line R, mainly

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:53.480
the set of real numbers, into
M different regions, which

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:57.880
we'll call R1 up to R sub M.
And in this picture here,

00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:03.220
here's R1, here's R2, here's R3,
here's R4, R5 and R6, and

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:05.600
that's all the regions
we have.

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:08.290
You'll notice one of the things
that that does is it

00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:11.890
takes an enormous set of
numbers, namely all these

00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:14.790
numbers less than this,
and match them all

00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:16.730
into the same symbol.

00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:19.200
So you might wind up with a
fair amount of distortion

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:22.880
there, no matter how you
measure distortion.

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:26.000
All these outliers here all
get mapped into a6, and

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.620
everything in the middle gets
mapped somehow into these

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:32.080
intermediate values.

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:38.140
But every source value now in
the region R sub j, we're

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:42.210
going to map into a
representation point a sub j.

00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:46.220
So everything in R1 is going
to be mapped into a1.

00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:48.325
Everything in R2 is going
to get mapped

00:12:48.325 --> 00:12:51.380
into a2 and so forth.

00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:55.500
Is this a general way to map
R into a set of M symbols?

00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:00.580
Is there anything else I ought
to be thinking about?

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:10.490
Well, here, these regions here
have a very special property.

00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:13.850
Namely, each region
is an interval.

00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:17.580
And we might say to ourselves,
well, maybe we shouldn't map

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:19.830
points into intervals.

00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:23.450
But aside from the fact that
we've chosen intervals here,

00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:27.230
this is a perfectly general
way to represent a mapping

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:31.080
from the real numbers into
a discrete set of things.

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:33.970
Namely, when you're doing a
mapping from the real numbers

00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:37.920
into a discrete set of things,
there's some set of real

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:41.660
numbers that get mapped
into a1, and that by

00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:43.920
definition is called R1.

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:47.220
There's some set of numbers
which get mapped into a2.

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:51.030
That by definition is called
R2 and so forth.

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:54.570
So aside from the fact that
these intervals with these

00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:58.530
regions in this picture happen
to be intervals, this is a

00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:04.290
perfectly general mapping from
R into a discrete alphabet.

00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:07.100
So since I've decided I'm
going to look at scalar

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:10.720
quantizers first, this is a
completely general view of

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:13.120
what a scalar quantizer is.

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:17.580
You tell me how many
quantization regions you want,

00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:23.610
namely how big the alphabet is
that you're mapping things

00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:26.540
into, and then your only problem
is how do you choose

00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:28.910
these regions and how
do you choose the

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:31.110
representation points?

00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:37.260
OK, one new thing here: Before,
we said when you have

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:41.040
a set of symbols a1 up to
a6, it doesn't matter

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:43.120
what you call them.

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:45.630
They're just six symbols.

00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:48.290
Here it makes a difference what
you call them because

00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:52.350
here they are representing
real numbers and they are

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:57.590
representing real numbers
because when you map some real

00:14:57.590 --> 00:15:03.940
number on the real line into one
of these letters here, the

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:07.440
distortion is u minus a sub j.

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:11.950
If you're mapping u into a sub
j, then you get a distortion,

00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:14.630
which is this difference here.

00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:18.010
I haven't said yet what I am
interested in as far as

00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:19.320
distortion is concerned.

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:24.040
Am I interested in squared
distortion, cubed distortion,

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:26.580
absolute magnitude
of distortion?

00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:28.600
I haven't answered that
question yet.

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:31.980
But there is a distortion here,
and somehow that has to

00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:32.720
be important.

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:38.610
We have to come to grips with
what we call a distortion and

00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:41.860
somehow how big that distortion
is going to be.

00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:46.230
So our problem here is somehow
to trade off between

00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:49.750
distortion and number
of points.

00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:52.110
As we make the number of
points bigger, we can

00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:56.150
presumably make the distortion
smaller in some sense,

00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:58.800
although the distortion is
always going to be very big

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:02.850
from these really big negative
numbers and from really big

00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:04.130
positive numbers.

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:08.460
But aside from that, we just
have a problem of how do you

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:09.440
choose the regions?

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:13.530
How do you choose the points?

00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:16.960
OK, I've sort of forgotten
about the problem that we

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:20.000
started with.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.990
And the problem that we started
with was to have a

00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:28.140
source where the source was
a sequence of numbers.

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:30.570
And when we're talking about
sources, we're talking about

00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:31.770
something stochastic.

00:16:31.770 --> 00:16:37.680
We need a probability measure
on these real numbers that

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:38.920
we're encoding.

00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:41.730
If we knew what they were, there
wouldn't be any need to

00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:44.440
encode them.

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:47.490
I mean, if we knew and the
receiver knew, there would be

00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:48.540
no need to encode them.

00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:53.680
The receiver would just print
out what they were or store

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:55.540
them or do whatever
the receiver

00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:57.770
wants to do with them.

00:16:57.770 --> 00:17:01.020
OK, so we're going to view the
source value u with the sample

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:05.460
value of some random variable
capital U. And more generally,

00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:10.410
since we have a sequence, we're
going to consider a

00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:15.610
source sequence to be U1, U2, U3
and so forth, or you could

00:17:15.610 --> 00:17:19.330
consider it a bi-infinite
sequence, starting at U minus

00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:23.970
infinity and working
its way up forever.

00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:28.650
And then we're going to have
some sort of model,

00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:32.480
statistical model, for this
sequence of random variables.

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:36.010
Our typical model for these is
to assume that we have a

00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:37.580
memoryless source.

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:41.950
In other words, U1, U2, U3 are
independent, identically

00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:43.930
distributed, random variables.

00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:49.290
That's the model we'll use until
we get smarter and start

00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:51.220
to think of something else.

00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:54.860
OK, so now each of these source
values we're going to

00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:58.590
map into some representation
point a sub j.

00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:01.690
That's what defines
the quantizer.

00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:05.090
And now since a sub j is a
sample value of a random

00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:09.400
variable U, a sub j is going to
be a sample value of some

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:13.740
random variable V. OK, in other
words, the probabilities

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:16.510
of these different sample
values is going to be

00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:22.330
determined by the set of U's
that math into that a sub j.

00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:26.240
So we have a source sequence
U1, U2, blah, blah, blah.

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:30.720
We have a representation
sequence V1, V2, blah, blah,

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:38.040
blah, which is defined by if U
sub k is in R sub j, then Vk

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:40.470
is equal to a sub j.

00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:43.690
Point of confusion here: It's
not confusing now, but it will

00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:46.890
be confusing at some
point to you.

00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:50.250
When you're talking about
sources, you really need two

00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:53.690
indices that you're talking
about all the time.

00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:59.450
OK, one of them is
how to represent

00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:01.340
different elements in time.

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:05.300
Here we're using k as a way of
keeping track of what element

00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:07.070
in time we're talking about.

00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:10.570
We're also talking about a
discrete alphabet, which has a

00:19:10.570 --> 00:19:13.310
certain number of elements in
it, which is completely

00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:15.500
independent of time.

00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:18.900
Namely, we've just described
the quantizer as something

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:22.420
which maps real numbers
into sample values.

00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:24.350
It has nothing to do
with time at all.

00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:26.650
We're going to use that same
thing again and again and

00:19:26.650 --> 00:19:29.880
again, and we're using
the subscript j

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:32.930
to talk about that.

00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:37.830
When you write out problem
solutions, you are going to

00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:41.570
find that it's incredibly
difficult sometimes to write

00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:45.080
sentences which distinguish
about whether you're talking

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:50.880
about one element out of an
alphabet or one element out of

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:54.220
a time sequence.

00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:56.910
And everybody has that trouble,
and you read most of

00:19:56.910 --> 00:19:59.870
the literature in information
theory or communication

00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:02.880
theory, and you can't sort out
most of the time what people

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:05.770
are talking about because
they're doing that.

00:20:05.770 --> 00:20:11.360
I recommend to you using an
element and an alphabet to

00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:15.030
talk about this sort of thing,
what a sub j is or an element

00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:17.630
and a time sequence to
keep track of things

00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:18.590
at different times.

00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:21.950
It's a nice way of keeping
them straight.

00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:26.370
OK, so anyway, for a scalar
quantizer, we're going to be

00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:30.890
able to just look at a single
random variable U, which is a

00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:34.490
continuous-valued random
variable, which takes values

00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:40.230
anywhere on the real line and
maps it into a single element

00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:49.120
in this discrete alphabet, which
is the set a1 up to a6

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:50.650
that we were talking
about here.

00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:56.090
So a scalar quantizer then is
just a map of this form, OK?

00:20:56.090 --> 00:20:58.960
So the only thing we need for a
scalar quantizer, we can now

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:02.030
forget about time and talk about
how do you choose the

00:21:02.030 --> 00:21:07.080
regions, how do you choose the
representation points?

00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:13.270
OK, and there's a nice
algorithm there.

00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:16.380
Again, one of these things,
which if you were the first

00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:21.540
person to think about it, easy
way to become famous.

00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:26.540
You might not stay famous, but
you can get famous initially.

00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:30.970
Anyway, we're almost always
interested in the mean squared

00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:35.880
error or the mean squared
distortion, MSD or MSE, which

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:41.890
is the expected value of U minus
V. U is this real-valued

00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:43.040
random variable.

00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:48.570
V is the discrete random
variable into which it maps.

00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:52.960
We have the distortion between
U and V, which is U minus V.

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:58.740
We now have the expected value
of that squared distortion.

00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:02.880
Why is everybody interested in
squared distortion instead of

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:05.630
magnitude distortion
or something else?

00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:09.480
In many engineering problems,
you should be more interested

00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:11.690
in magnitude distortion.

00:22:11.690 --> 00:22:14.180
Sometimes you're much more
interested in fourth-moment

00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:16.610
distortion or some other
strange thing.

00:22:16.610 --> 00:22:20.780
Why do we always use mean
squared distortion?

00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:24.680
And why do we use mean-squared
everything throughout almost

00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:29.470
everything we do in
communication?

00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:30.810
I'll tell you the reason now.

00:22:30.810 --> 00:22:35.780
We'll come back and talk about
it more a number of times.

00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:38.870
It's because this quantization
problem that we're talking

00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:43.870
about is almost always a
subproblem of this problem,

00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:46.910
where you're dealing with
waveforms, where you take the

00:22:46.910 --> 00:22:49.760
waveform and you sample the
waveform, where you take the

00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:54.970
waveform, and you turn the
waveform into some expansion.

00:22:54.970 --> 00:22:59.980
When you find the mean-squared
distortion in a quantizer, it

00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:03.700
turns out that that maps in
a beautiful way into the

00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:07.340
mean-squared distortion
between waveforms.

00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:11.040
If you deal with magnitudes or
with anything else in the

00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:14.990
world, all of that beauty
goes away, OK?

00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:17.740
In other words, whenever you
want to go from waveforms to

00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:22.890
numbers, the one thing which
remains invariant, which

00:23:22.890 --> 00:23:28.040
remains nice all the way
through, is this mean-square

00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:31.040
distortion, mean-square
value, OK?

00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:34.620
In other words, if you want
to layer this problem into

00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:37.390
looking at this problem
separately from looking at

00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:42.250
this problem, almost the only
way you can do it that makes

00:23:42.250 --> 00:23:46.100
sense is to worry about mean
square distortion rather than

00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:48.920
some other kind of distortion.

00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:51.980
So even though as engineers
we might be interested in

00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:55.240
something else, we almost always
stick to that because

00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:58.730
that's the thing that we can
deal with most nicely.

00:23:58.730 --> 00:24:04.210
I mean, as engineers, we're like
the drunk who dropped his

00:24:04.210 --> 00:24:07.940
wallet on a dark street, and
he's searching for it, and

00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:08.980
somebody comes along.

00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:14.090
And here he is underneath a
beautiful light where he can

00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:15.390
see everything.

00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:17.890
Somebody asks him what he's
looking for you, and he says

00:24:17.890 --> 00:24:19.290
he's looking for his wallet.

00:24:19.290 --> 00:24:21.620
The guy looks down and says,
well, there's no wallet there.

00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:22.630
The drunk says I know.

00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:25.200
I dropped it over there, but
it's dark over there.

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:28.350
So we use mean square
distortion in

00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:29.880
exactly the same sense.

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:32.940
It isn't necessarily the problem
we're interested in,

00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:37.150
but it's a problem where we
can see things clearly.

00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:44.560
So given that we're interested
in the mean square distortion

00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:48.950
of a scalar quantizer, an
interesting analytical problem

00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:54.630
that we can play with is for a
given probability density on

00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:58.530
this real random variable, and
we're assuming we have a

00:24:58.530 --> 00:25:06.010
probability density and a given
alphabet size M, the

00:25:06.010 --> 00:25:10.330
problem is how do you choose
these regions and how do you

00:25:10.330 --> 00:25:14.140
choose these representation
points in such a way as to

00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:18.340
minimize the mean square
error, OK?

00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:20.950
So, in other words, we've taken
a big sort of messy

00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:24.690
amorphous engineering problem,
and we said, OK, we're going

00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:27.160
to deal with mean square error,
and OK, we're going to

00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:32.670
deal with scalar quantizers, and
OK, we're going to fix a

00:25:32.670 --> 00:25:36.290
number of quantization levels,
so we've made all those

00:25:36.290 --> 00:25:38.450
choices to start with.

00:25:38.450 --> 00:25:42.200
We still have this interesting
problem of how do you choose

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:43.700
the right regions?

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:47.250
How do you choose the
right sample points?

00:25:47.250 --> 00:25:51.280
And that turns out to
be a simple problem.

00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:53.000
I wouldn't talk about
if it wasn't simple.

00:25:58.450 --> 00:26:01.310
And we'll break it into
subproblems, and the

00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:04.510
subproblems are really simple.

00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:09.200
The first subproblem is if I
tell you what representation

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:15.190
points I want to use, namely,
in this picture here, I say

00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:19.610
OK, I want to use these
representation points.

00:26:19.610 --> 00:26:22.150
And then I ask you, how are
you going to choose the

00:26:22.150 --> 00:26:28.350
regions in an optimal way to
minimize mean square error?

00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:31.370
Well, you think about that for
awhile, and you think about it

00:26:31.370 --> 00:26:33.160
in a number of ways.

00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:35.460
When you think about it in just
the right way, the answer

00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:38.130
becomes obvious.

00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:42.970
And the answer is, let me not
think about the regions here,

00:26:42.970 --> 00:26:46.030
but let me think about a
particular value that comes

00:26:46.030 --> 00:26:47.730
out of the source.

00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:51.580
Let me think, how should I
construct a rule for how to

00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:57.120
take outputs from this
source and map them

00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:00.100
into some number here.

00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:05.250
So if I get some output from
the source u, I say, OK,

00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:09.080
what's the distortion
between u and a1?

00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:10.540
It's u minus a1.

00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:13.930
And the magnitude of that is the
magnitude of u minus a1.

00:27:13.930 --> 00:27:17.790
The square of it is the square
of u minus a1, and then say,

00:27:17.790 --> 00:27:20.660
OK, let me compare that
with u minus a2.

00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:24.650
Let me compare it with u
minus a3 and so forth.

00:27:24.650 --> 00:27:28.500
Let me choose the smallest
of those things.

00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:31.690
What's the smallest stuff
for any given u?

00:27:31.690 --> 00:27:35.760
Suppose I have a u which
happens to be

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:38.630
right there, for example.

00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:40.900
What's the closest
representation point?

00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:49.650
Well, a3 is obviously
closer than a2.

00:27:49.650 --> 00:27:55.460
And in fact for any point in
here, which is closer to a3

00:27:55.460 --> 00:27:58.620
than it is to a2, we're
going to choose a3.

00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:02.420
Now what's the set of points
which are closer to a3 than

00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:04.720
they are to a2?

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:09.590
Well, you put a line here right
between a2 and a3, OK?

00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:13.330
When you put that line right
between a2 and a3, everything

00:28:13.330 --> 00:28:17.720
on this side is closer to a3 and
everything on this side is

00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:19.970
closer to a2.

00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:21.830
So the answer is,
in fact, simple,

00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:24.990
once you see the answer.

00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:30.610
And the answer is, given these
points, we simply construct

00:28:30.610 --> 00:28:34.430
bisectors between them, namely,
bisectors with --

00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:38.810
halfway between a1 and
a2, we call that b1.

00:28:38.810 --> 00:28:43.600
Halfway between a2 and a3, we
call that b2, and those are

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:46.300
the separators between
the regions, OK?

00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:53.390
In other words, what we wind
up doing is we define the

00:28:53.390 --> 00:28:57.740
region R sub j, the set of
things which get mapped into a

00:28:57.740 --> 00:29:06.660
sub j as the region which is
bounded by bj minus 1 is the

00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:13.040
average of aj and aj minus 1,
and bj is the average of aj

00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:17.360
and aj plus 1, where I've
already ordered the points a

00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:23.750
sub j going from left
to right, OK?

00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:29.060
And that also tells us that the
minimum mean square error

00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:32.550
regions have got to
be intervals.

00:29:32.550 --> 00:29:35.990
There is no reason at all to
ever pick regions which are

00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:39.130
not intervals because, as soon
as you start to solve this

00:29:39.130 --> 00:29:44.690
problem for any given set of
representation points, you

00:29:44.690 --> 00:29:47.050
wind up with intervals.

00:29:47.050 --> 00:29:51.150
So if you ever think of using
things that are not intervals

00:29:51.150 --> 00:29:55.570
for this mean square error
problem, then as soon as you

00:29:55.570 --> 00:29:58.630
look at this, you say, well,
aha, that can't be the best

00:29:58.630 --> 00:30:00.050
thing to do.

00:30:00.050 --> 00:30:02.560
I will make my regions
intervals.

00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:05.770
I will therefore simplify the
whole problem, and I'll also

00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:06.890
improve it.

00:30:06.890 --> 00:30:09.550
And when you can both simplify
things and improve them at the

00:30:09.550 --> 00:30:13.860
same time, it usually is worth
doing it unless you're dealing

00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:17.060
with standards bodies or
something, and then

00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:19.210
all bets are off.

00:30:19.210 --> 00:30:22.420
OK, so this one part of
the problem is easy.

00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:32.640
If we know what the
representation points are, we

00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:35.070
can solve the problem.

00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:40.180
OK, we have a second problem,
which is just

00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:41.720
the opposite problem.

00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:46.630
Suppose then that somebody gives
you the interval regions

00:30:46.630 --> 00:30:50.050
and asks you, OK, if I give you
these interval regions,

00:30:50.050 --> 00:30:53.240
how are you going to choose the
representation points to

00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:55.030
minimize the mean
square error?

00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:05.710
And analytically that's harder,
but conceptually, it's

00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:07.740
just about as easy.

00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:10.200
And let's look at it and see
if we can understand it.

00:31:12.970 --> 00:31:18.240
Somebody gives us this region
here, R sub 2, and says, OK,

00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:22.720
where should we put
the point a sub 2?

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:25.490
Well, anybody have any
clues as to where

00:31:25.490 --> 00:31:26.390
you want to put it?

00:31:26.390 --> 00:31:29.020
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:29.370
PROFESSOR: What?

00:31:29.370 --> 00:31:30.040
AUDIENCE: At the midpoint?

00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:30.980
PROFESSOR: At the midpoint.

00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:32.700
It sounds like a reasonable
thing, but

00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:33.600
it's not quite right.

00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:36.330
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:36.330 --> 00:31:38.790
PROFESSOR: What?

00:31:38.790 --> 00:31:38.960
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:43.100
PROFESSOR: It depends on the
probability density, yes.

00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:46.340
If you have a probability
density, which is highly

00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:52.030
weighted over on -- let's see,
was I talking about R2 or R3?

00:31:52.030 --> 00:31:53.050
Well, it doesn't make
any difference.

00:31:53.050 --> 00:31:54.830
We'll talk about R2.

00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:58.400
If I have a probability density,
which looks like

00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:06.450
this, then I want a2 to be
closer to the left-hand side

00:32:06.450 --> 00:32:07.690
than to the right-hand side.

00:32:07.690 --> 00:32:11.320
I want it to be a little bit
weighted towards here because

00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:13.410
that's more important
in choosing

00:32:13.410 --> 00:32:14.660
the mean square error.

00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:21.150
OK, if you didn't have any of
this stuff, and I said how do

00:32:21.150 --> 00:32:26.220
I choose this to minimize the
mean square error, what's your

00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:27.060
answer then?

00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:31.850
If I just have one region and
I want to minimize the mean

00:32:31.850 --> 00:32:34.220
square error, what do you do?

00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:38.920
Anybody who doesn't know should
go back and study

00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:42.880
elementary probability theory
because this is almost day one

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:46.760
of elementary probability theory
when you start to study

00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:49.740
what random variables
are all about.

00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:52.410
And the next thing you start
to look at is things like

00:32:52.410 --> 00:32:54.930
variance and second moment.

00:32:54.930 --> 00:32:59.530
And what I'm asking you here
is, how do you choose a2 in

00:32:59.530 --> 00:33:04.190
order to minimize the second
moment of U, whatever it is in

00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:05.170
here, minus a2?

00:33:05.170 --> 00:33:05.480
Yes?

00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:07.850
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:07.850 --> 00:33:10.290
PROFESSOR: I want to take
the expectation of U

00:33:10.290 --> 00:33:12.600
over the region R2.

00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:16.130
In other words, to say it more
technically, I want to take

00:33:16.130 --> 00:33:20.970
the expectation of the
conditional random variable U,

00:33:20.970 --> 00:33:24.260
conditional on being
in R2, OK?

00:33:27.790 --> 00:33:31.220
And all of you could figure that
out yourselves, if you

00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:35.820
sat down quietly and thought
about it for five minutes.

00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:39.720
If you got frightened about it
and started looking it up in a

00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:41.860
book or something, it
would take you about

00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:43.840
two hours to do it.

00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:47.110
But if you just asked
yourselves, how do I do it?

00:33:47.110 --> 00:33:52.900
You'll come up with the right
answer very, very soon, OK?

00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:58.300
So subproblem 2 says let's
look at the conditional

00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:02.670
density of U in this
region R sub j.

00:34:02.670 --> 00:34:05.780
I'll call the conditional
density -- well, the

00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:09.010
conditional density, given that
you're in this region,

00:34:09.010 --> 00:34:13.990
is, in fact, the real density
divided by the probability of

00:34:13.990 --> 00:34:16.500
being in that interval, OK?

00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:20.270
So we'll call that the
conditional density.

00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:25.000
And I'll let U of j be the
random variable, which has

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:25.790
this density.

00:34:25.790 --> 00:34:29.860
In other words, this isn't
a random variable on the

00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:32.320
probability space that we
started to deal with it.

00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:36.450
It's sort of a phony
random variable.

00:34:36.450 --> 00:34:38.200
But, in fact, it's the
intuitive thing that

00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:39.930
you think of, OK?

00:34:39.930 --> 00:34:42.080
In other words, if this is
exactly what you were thinking

00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:44.450
of, you probably wouldn't have
called this a separate random

00:34:44.450 --> 00:34:46.850
variable, OK?

00:34:46.850 --> 00:34:50.390
So this is a random variable
with this density.

00:34:50.390 --> 00:34:55.170
The expected value of U of j
minus a of j quantity squared,

00:34:55.170 --> 00:35:02.150
as you all know, is sigma
squared of U of j plus the

00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:08.850
expected value a U of j minus a
sub j quantity squared, OK?

00:35:08.850 --> 00:35:10.680
How do you minimize this?

00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:13.090
Well, you're stuck with this.

00:35:13.090 --> 00:35:17.070
This term, you minimize it by
making a sub j equal to the

00:35:17.070 --> 00:35:20.770
expected value of
U of j, which is

00:35:20.770 --> 00:35:21.980
exactly what you said.

00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:29.070
Namely, you set a of j to be the
conditional mean of U of j

00:35:29.070 --> 00:35:31.980
conditional on being
in the center.

00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:33.840
It's harder to say
mathematically than

00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:35.090
it is to see it.

00:35:37.310 --> 00:35:41.280
But, in fact, the intuitive
idea is exactly right.

00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:44.470
Namely, you condition your
random variable on being in

00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:47.680
that interval, and then what you
want to do is choose the

00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:51.670
mean within that interval, which
is exactly the sort of

00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:53.810
thing we were thinking
about here.

00:35:53.810 --> 00:35:57.900
When I drew this curve here, if
I scale it, this, in fact,

00:35:57.900 --> 00:36:01.140
is the density of
u conditional on

00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:03.050
being in R sub j.

00:36:03.050 --> 00:36:05.660
And now all I'm trying to do
is choose the point here,

00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:07.620
which happens to be
the mean which

00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:11.470
minimizes this second moment.

00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:14.870
The second moment, in fact,
is this mean square error.

00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:16.760
So, bingo!

00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:20.400
That's the second problem.

00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:22.310
Well, how do you put the
two problems together?

00:36:25.130 --> 00:36:28.260
Well, you can put it together
in two ways.

00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:31.960
One of them is to say, OK, well
then, clearly an optimal

00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:35.540
scalar quantizer has to
satisfy both of these

00:36:35.540 --> 00:36:36.650
conditions.

00:36:36.650 --> 00:36:39.600
Namely, the endpoints of the
regions have to be the

00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:43.390
midpoints of the representation
points, and the

00:36:43.390 --> 00:36:47.770
representation points have to
be the conditional means of

00:36:47.770 --> 00:36:56.790
the points within a region
that you start with.

00:36:56.790 --> 00:37:00.160
And then you say, OK, how
do I solve that problem?

00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:02.750
Well, if you're a computer
scientist, and sometimes it's

00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:05.220
good to be a computer scientist,
you say, well, I

00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:08.780
don't know how to solve the
problem, but generating an

00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:12.290
algorithm to solve the problem
is almost trivial.

00:37:12.290 --> 00:37:16.040
I start out with some
arbitrary set of

00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:17.730
representation points.

00:37:17.730 --> 00:37:22.220
That should be a capital M
because that's the number of

00:37:22.220 --> 00:37:25.480
points I'm allowed to use.

00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:29.330
Then the next step in the
algorithm is I choose these

00:37:29.330 --> 00:37:34.070
separation points to be b sub j
is the midpoint between the

00:37:34.070 --> 00:37:37.120
a's for each of these values.

00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:40.630
Then as soon as I get these
midpoints, I have a set of

00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:45.200
intervals, and my next step is
to say set a sub j is equal to

00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:49.320
the expected value of this
conditional random variable U

00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:54.530
of j where R sub j is now this
new interval for 1 less than

00:37:54.530 --> 00:37:57.410
or equal to j less than
or equal to M minus 1.

00:37:57.410 --> 00:38:01.820
This means it's open
on the left side.

00:38:01.820 --> 00:38:04.950
This means it's closed on the
right side, and since it's a

00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:07.140
probability density, it doesn't
make any difference

00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:08.030
what it is.

00:38:08.030 --> 00:38:11.610
I just wanted to give you an
explicit rule for what to do

00:38:11.610 --> 00:38:15.640
with probability zero when you
happen to wind up on that

00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:17.260
special point.

00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:22.800
OK, and then you iterate on
2 and 3 until you get a

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:25.390
negligible improvement.

00:38:25.390 --> 00:38:27.880
And then you ask, of course,
well, if I got a negligible

00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:29.680
improvement this time, maybe
I'll get a bigger

00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:31.440
improvement next time.

00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:34.670
And that, of course, is true.

00:38:34.670 --> 00:38:40.700
And you then say, well, it's
possible that after I can't

00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:43.220
get any improvement anymore,
I still don't

00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:44.910
have the optimal solution.

00:38:44.910 --> 00:38:46.780
And that, of course,
is true also.

00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:50.010
But at least you have an
algorithm which makes sense

00:38:50.010 --> 00:38:53.000
and which, each time you try
it, you do a little better

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.250
than you did before.

00:38:55.250 --> 00:39:00.030
Now, this mean square error for
any choice of regions and

00:39:00.030 --> 00:39:03.160
any choice of representation
points is going to be

00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:05.640
nonnegative because
it's an expected

00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:10.080
value of squared terms.

00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:13.040
The algorithm is nonincreasing
with iterations.

00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:17.390
In other words, the algorithm
is going down all the time.

00:39:17.390 --> 00:39:19.480
So you have zero down here.

00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:24.090
You have an algorithm which is
marching you down toward zero.

00:39:24.090 --> 00:39:30.080
It's not going to get to zero,
but it has to reach a minimum.

00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:32.900
That's a major theorem in
analysis, but you don't need

00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:35.710
any major theorems in analysis
to see this.

00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:38.290
You have a set of numbers, which
are decreasing all the

00:39:38.290 --> 00:39:41.390
time, and they're bounded
underneath.

00:39:41.390 --> 00:39:44.860
After awhile, you have to get
to some point, and you don't

00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:45.920
go any further.

00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:48.610
So it has a limit.

00:39:48.610 --> 00:39:49.420
So that's nice.

00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:53.100
So you have an algorithm
which has to converge.

00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:54.870
It can't keep on going.

00:39:54.870 --> 00:39:57.330
Well, it can keep on going
forever, but it keeps going on

00:39:57.330 --> 00:40:00.540
forever with smaller and
smaller improvements.

00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:05.050
So eventually, you might as well
stop because you're not

00:40:05.050 --> 00:40:08.150
getting anywhere.

00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:11.530
OK, well, those conditions
that we stated, the way a

00:40:11.530 --> 00:40:15.790
mathematician would say this, is
these Lloyd-Max conditions

00:40:15.790 --> 00:40:18.880
are necessary but not
sufficient, OK?

00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:21.720
In other words, any solution
to this problem that we're

00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:24.510
looking at has to have
the property that the

00:40:24.510 --> 00:40:30.250
representation points are the
conditional means of the

00:40:30.250 --> 00:40:34.330
intervals and the interval
boundaries are the midpoints

00:40:34.330 --> 00:40:37.410
between the representation
points.

00:40:37.410 --> 00:40:40.230
But that isn't necessarily
enough.

00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:42.950
Here's a simple example of
where it's not enough.

00:40:42.950 --> 00:40:46.050
Suppose you have a probability
density, which is running

00:40:46.050 --> 00:40:50.670
along almost zero, jumps up to
a big value, almost zero,

00:40:50.670 --> 00:40:54.310
jumps up to a big value, jumps
up to a big value.

00:40:54.310 --> 00:40:59.970
This intentionally is wider than
this and wider than this.

00:40:59.970 --> 00:41:03.090
In other words, there's a lot
more probability over here

00:41:03.090 --> 00:41:06.820
than there is here
or there is here.

00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:11.840
And you're unlucky, and you
start out somehow with points

00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:18.460
like a1 and a2, and you start
out with regions like R1 --

00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:23.050
well, yeah, you want to start
out with points, a1 and a2.

00:41:23.050 --> 00:41:26.280
So you start out with a point
a1, which is way over here,

00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:29.830
and a point a2, which is
not too far over here.

00:41:29.830 --> 00:41:33.490
And your algorithm then says
pick the midpoint b1.

00:41:33.490 --> 00:41:36.480
Here the algorithm is
particularly simple because,

00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:40.380
since we're only using two
regions, all you need is one

00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:42.220
separator point.

00:41:42.220 --> 00:41:45.440
So we wind up with b1 here,
which is halfway

00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:47.660
between a1 and a2.

00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:50.790
a1 happens to be right in the
middle of that big interval

00:41:50.790 --> 00:41:54.990
there, and there's hardly
anything else here.

00:41:54.990 --> 00:41:59.100
So a1 just stays there as the
conditional mean, given that

00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:01.310
you're on this side.

00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:05.070
And a2 stays as the conditional
mean, given that

00:42:05.070 --> 00:42:08.350
you're over here, which means
that a2 is a little closer

00:42:08.350 --> 00:42:12.010
this big region than it is
to this region, but a2 is

00:42:12.010 --> 00:42:13.940
perfectly happy there.

00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:16.810
And we go back and
we iterate again.

00:42:16.810 --> 00:42:21.530
And we haven't changed b1, we
haven't changed a1, we haven't

00:42:21.530 --> 00:42:25.810
changed a2, and therefore, the
algorithm sticks there.

00:42:25.810 --> 00:42:27.740
Well, that's not surprising.

00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:30.180
I mean, you know that there are
many problems where you

00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:33.570
try to minimize things by
differentiating or all the

00:42:33.570 --> 00:42:37.380
different tricks you have for
minimizing things, and you

00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:40.840
very often find local minima.

00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:43.940
People call algorithms like this
hill-climbing algorithms.

00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:46.570
They should call them
valley-finding algorithms

00:42:46.570 --> 00:42:49.380
because we're sitting
at someplace.

00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:51.030
We try to find a better place.

00:42:51.030 --> 00:42:53.240
So we wind up moving
down into the

00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:55.760
valley further and further.

00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:58.780
Of course, if it's a real
geographical area, you finally

00:42:58.780 --> 00:43:00.180
wind up at the river.

00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:02.560
You then move down the river,
you wind up in the

00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:03.290
ocean and all that.

00:43:03.290 --> 00:43:05.290
But let's forgot about that.

00:43:05.290 --> 00:43:08.000
Let's just assume that there
aren't rivers or anything.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:11.980
That we just have some arbitrary
geographical area.

00:43:11.980 --> 00:43:15.720
We wind up in the bottom of a
valley, and we say, OK, are we

00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:18.070
at the minimum or not?

00:43:18.070 --> 00:43:20.730
Well, with hill climbing, you
can take a pair of binoculars,

00:43:20.730 --> 00:43:23.330
and you look around to see if
there's any higher peak

00:43:23.330 --> 00:43:25.350
someplace else.

00:43:25.350 --> 00:43:27.350
With valley seeking,
you can't do that.

00:43:27.350 --> 00:43:29.780
We're sitting there at the
bottom of the valley, and we

00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:32.640
have no idea whether there's a
better valley somewhere else

00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:35.970
or not, OK?

00:43:35.970 --> 00:43:39.110
So that's the trouble with
hill-climbing algorithms or

00:43:39.110 --> 00:43:41.700
valley-seeking algorithms.

00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:45.030
And that's exactly what
this algorithm does.

00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:48.660
This is called the Lloyd-Max
algorithm because a guy by the

00:43:48.660 --> 00:43:53.820
name of Lloyd at Bell Labs
discovered it, I think in '57.

00:43:53.820 --> 00:43:57.350
A guy by the name of Joel
Max discovered it again.

00:43:57.350 --> 00:44:01.770
He was at MIT in 1960, and
because all the information

00:44:01.770 --> 00:44:04.660
theorists around were at MIT at
that time, they called it

00:44:04.660 --> 00:44:06.990
the Max algorithm
for many years.

00:44:06.990 --> 00:44:09.250
And then somebody discovered
that Lloyd had done it three

00:44:09.250 --> 00:44:10.030
years earlier.

00:44:10.030 --> 00:44:12.300
Lloyd never even published it.

00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:15.170
So it became the Lloyd-Max
algorithm.

00:44:15.170 --> 00:44:17.520
And now there's somebody else
who did it even earlier, I

00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:21.780
think, so we should probably
take Max's name off it.

00:44:21.780 --> 00:44:27.210
But anyway, sometime when I
revise the notes, I will give

00:44:27.210 --> 00:44:29.410
the whole story of that.

00:44:29.410 --> 00:44:31.780
But I hope you see that
this algorithm

00:44:31.780 --> 00:44:34.400
is no big deal anyway.

00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:38.220
It was just people fortunately
looking at the question at the

00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:41.170
right time before too many other
people had looked at it.

00:44:41.170 --> 00:44:43.680
And Max unfortunately
looked at it.

00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:44.580
He was in a valley.

00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:47.900
He didn't see all the other
people had looked at it.

00:44:47.900 --> 00:44:49.130
But he became famous.

00:44:49.130 --> 00:44:53.840
He had his moment of time and
then sunk gradually into

00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:59.040
oblivion except when once
in awhile we call it the

00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:00.570
Lloyd-Max algorithm.

00:45:00.570 --> 00:45:03.020
Most people call it the Lloyd
algorithm, though, and I

00:45:03.020 --> 00:45:05.710
really should also.

00:45:05.710 --> 00:45:10.290
OK, vector quantization:
We talked about vector

00:45:10.290 --> 00:45:11.610
quantization a little bit.

00:45:11.610 --> 00:45:16.530
It's the idea of segmenting the
source outputs before you

00:45:16.530 --> 00:45:19.330
try to do the encoding.

00:45:19.330 --> 00:45:21.800
So we ask is scalar quantization
going to be the

00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:23.710
right approach?

00:45:23.710 --> 00:45:27.080
To answer that question, we want
to look at quantizing two

00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:31.070
sample values jointly and
drawing pictures.

00:45:31.070 --> 00:45:35.100
Incidentally, what's the
simplest way of quantizing

00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:37.490
that you can think of?

00:45:37.490 --> 00:45:40.440
And what do people who do simple
things call quantizers?

00:45:44.780 --> 00:45:48.360
Ever hear of an
analog-to-digital converter?

00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:51.380
That's what a quantizer is.

00:45:51.380 --> 00:45:53.330
And an analog-to-digital
converter, the way that

00:45:53.330 --> 00:45:56.890
everybody does it, is scalar.

00:45:56.890 --> 00:46:00.370
So that says that either the
people who implement things

00:46:00.370 --> 00:46:03.400
are very stupid, or there's
something pretty good about

00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:05.630
scalar quantization.

00:46:05.630 --> 00:46:09.190
But anyway, since this is a
course trying to find better

00:46:09.190 --> 00:46:13.220
ways of doing things, we ought
to investigate whether it is

00:46:13.220 --> 00:46:16.000
better to use vector
quantizers and

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.260
what they result in.

00:46:18.260 --> 00:46:20.880
OK, well, the first thing that
we can do is look at

00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:23.360
quantizing two samples.

00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:26.480
In other words, when you want
to generalize a problem to

00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:31.050
vectors, I find it better to
generalize it to two vectors

00:46:31.050 --> 00:46:33.980
first and see what
goes on there.

00:46:33.980 --> 00:46:37.720
And one possible approach is to
use a rectangular grid of

00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:40.280
quantization regions.

00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:43.740
And as I'll show you in the
next slide, that really is

00:46:43.740 --> 00:46:48.420
just a camouflaged scalar
quantizer again.

00:46:48.420 --> 00:46:52.410
So you have a two-dimensional
region corresponding to two

00:46:52.410 --> 00:46:53.880
real samples.

00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:57.460
So you've got two real
numbers, U1 and U2.

00:46:57.460 --> 00:47:03.080
You're trying to map them into
a finite set of sample values

00:47:03.080 --> 00:47:05.790
of representation points.

00:47:05.790 --> 00:47:09.760
Since you're going to be
interested in the distortion

00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:16.370
between U1 and U2, between the
vector U1, U2, and your

00:47:16.370 --> 00:47:23.680
representation vector, a1,
a2, these points, these

00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:26.350
representation points, are going
to be two-dimensional

00:47:26.350 --> 00:47:28.280
points also.

00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:31.970
So if you start out by saying
let's put these points on a

00:47:31.970 --> 00:47:36.420
rectangular grid, well, we can
then look at it, and we say,

00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:39.560
well, given the points, how
do we choose the regions?

00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:44.710
You see, it's exactly
the same problem

00:47:44.710 --> 00:47:47.440
that you solved before.

00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:52.440
If I give you the points and
then I ask you, well, if we

00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:58.820
get a vector U1, U2 that's
there, what do we map it to?

00:47:58.820 --> 00:48:02.275
Well, we map it to the closest
thing, which means if we want

00:48:02.275 --> 00:48:05.570
to find these regions, we set
up these perpendicular

00:48:05.570 --> 00:48:09.800
bisectors halfway between the
representation points.

00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:13.250
So all of this is looking very
rectangular now because we

00:48:13.250 --> 00:48:15.660
started out with these
points rectangular.

00:48:15.660 --> 00:48:19.840
These lines are rectangular, and
now I say, well, is this

00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:23.240
really any different from
a scalar quantizer?

00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:26.740
And, of course, it isn't because
for this particular

00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:31.340
vector quantizer, I can first
ask the question, OK, here's

00:48:31.340 --> 00:48:37.520
U1, which is something
in this direction.

00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:39.270
How do I find regions
for that?

00:48:39.270 --> 00:48:44.090
Well, for U1, I just establish
these regions here.

00:48:44.090 --> 00:48:46.920
And then I say, OK, let's
look at U2 next.

00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:51.350
And then I look at things in
this direction, and I wind up

00:48:51.350 --> 00:48:54.770
in saying, OK, that's all
there is to the problem.

00:48:54.770 --> 00:48:57.310
I have a scalar quantizer
again.

00:48:57.310 --> 00:49:00.520
Everything that I said
before works.

00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:04.040
Now if you're a theoretician,
you go one step further, and

00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:10.160
you say, what this tells me is
that vector quantizers cannot

00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:13.280
be any worse than scalar
quantizers.

00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:19.360
Because, in fact, a vector
quantizer has a -- or at least

00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:22.590
a vector quantizer in two
dimensions -- has a scalar

00:49:22.590 --> 00:49:23.430
quantizer --

00:49:23.430 --> 00:49:28.030
has two scalar quantizers
as a special case.

00:49:28.030 --> 00:49:32.210
And therefore, the amount of
square distortion that I wind

00:49:32.210 --> 00:49:37.600
up with in the vector case,
I can always get that --

00:49:40.970 --> 00:49:44.940
whatever I can do with the
scalar quantizer, I can do

00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:49.440
just as well with a vector
quantizer by choosing it, in

00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:51.770
fact, to be rectangular
like this.

00:49:51.770 --> 00:49:56.320
And you can also get some
intuitive ideas that if

00:49:56.320 --> 00:50:00.770
instead of having IID random
variables, if U1 and U2 are

00:50:00.770 --> 00:50:03.430
very heavily correlated somehow
so that they're very

00:50:03.430 --> 00:50:06.860
close together, I mean, you
sort of get an engineering

00:50:06.860 --> 00:50:08.700
view of what you want to do.

00:50:08.700 --> 00:50:11.610
You want to take this
rectangular picture here.

00:50:11.610 --> 00:50:14.300
You want to skew it
around that way.

00:50:14.300 --> 00:50:16.790
And you want to have lots of
points going this way and not

00:50:16.790 --> 00:50:20.010
too many points going this way
because almost everything is

00:50:20.010 --> 00:50:22.220
going this way, and
there's not much

00:50:22.220 --> 00:50:24.050
going on in that direction.

00:50:24.050 --> 00:50:30.470
So you got some pictures
of what you want to do.

00:50:30.470 --> 00:50:35.700
These regions here, a little bit
of terminology, are called

00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:38.330
Voronoi regions.

00:50:38.330 --> 00:50:42.680
Anytime you start out with a
set of points and you put

00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:46.520
perpendicular bisectors in
between those points, halfway

00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:49.550
between the points, you call the
regions that you wind up

00:50:49.550 --> 00:50:52.640
with Voronoi regions.

00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:58.000
So, in fact, part of this
Lloyd-Max algorithm,

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:03.800
generalized at two dimensions,
says given any set of points,

00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:07.360
the regions ought to be the
Voronoi regions for them.

00:51:07.360 --> 00:51:10.190
So that's that first subproblem
generalized at two

00:51:10.190 --> 00:51:11.440
dimensions.

00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:19.730
And if you have an arbitrary
set of points, the Voronoi

00:51:19.730 --> 00:51:24.580
regions look sort of
like this, OK?

00:51:24.580 --> 00:51:27.410
And I've only drawn it for the
center point because, well,

00:51:27.410 --> 00:51:30.860
there aren't enough points to
do anything more than that.

00:51:30.860 --> 00:51:34.520
So anything in this region gets
mapped into this point.

00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:38.030
Anything in this semi-infinite
region gets mapped into this

00:51:38.030 --> 00:51:40.590
point and so forth.

00:51:40.590 --> 00:51:43.510
So even in two dimensions,
this part of the

00:51:43.510 --> 00:51:46.580
algorithm is simple.

00:51:46.580 --> 00:51:49.810
When you start out with the
regions, with almost the same

00:51:49.810 --> 00:51:55.340
argument that we used before,
you can see that the mean

00:51:55.340 --> 00:51:59.370
square error is going to be
minimized by using conditional

00:51:59.370 --> 00:52:03.510
means for the representation
points.

00:52:03.510 --> 00:52:06.380
I mean, that's done in
detail in the notes.

00:52:06.380 --> 00:52:09.660
It's just algebra to do that.

00:52:09.660 --> 00:52:11.750
It's sort of intuitive that
the same thing ought to

00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:14.940
happen, and in fact, it does.

00:52:14.940 --> 00:52:18.490
So you can still find
a local minimum by

00:52:18.490 --> 00:52:22.440
this Lloyd-Max algorithm.

00:52:22.440 --> 00:52:24.950
If you're unhappy with the
fact that the Lloyd-Max

00:52:24.950 --> 00:52:30.020
algorithm doesn't always work
in one dimension, be content

00:52:30.020 --> 00:52:32.880
with the fact that it's far
worse in two dimensions, and

00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:35.330
it gets worse and worse as you
go to higher numbers of

00:52:35.330 --> 00:52:36.780
dimensions.

00:52:36.780 --> 00:52:41.910
So it is a local minimum,
but not

00:52:41.910 --> 00:52:45.360
necessarily the best thing.

00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:50.490
OK, well, about that time, and
let's go forward for maybe 10

00:52:50.490 --> 00:52:54.250
years from 1957 and '60 when
people were inventing the

00:52:54.250 --> 00:52:57.560
Lloyd-Max algorithm and where
they thought that quantization

00:52:57.560 --> 00:53:00.640
was a really neat academic
problem, and many people were

00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:04.950
writing theses on it and having
lots of fun with it.

00:53:04.950 --> 00:53:08.420
And then eventually, they
started to realize that when

00:53:08.420 --> 00:53:11.390
you try to solve that problem
and find the minimum, it

00:53:11.390 --> 00:53:13.990
really is just a very
ugly problem.

00:53:13.990 --> 00:53:17.180
At least it looks like a very
ugly problem with everything

00:53:17.180 --> 00:53:19.750
that anybody knows after
having worked on it

00:53:19.750 --> 00:53:21.160
for a very long time.

00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:24.380
So not many people work
on this anymore.

00:53:24.380 --> 00:53:27.090
So we stop and say, well, we
really don't want to go too

00:53:27.090 --> 00:53:29.640
far on this because it's ugly.

00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:31.640
But then we stop and think.

00:53:31.640 --> 00:53:34.510
I mean, anytime you get stuck
on a problem, you ought to

00:53:34.510 --> 00:53:36.640
stop and ask, well, am
I really looking

00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:37.890
at the right problem?

00:53:40.500 --> 00:53:45.770
Now why am I or why am I not
looking at the right problem?

00:53:45.770 --> 00:53:47.640
And remember where
we started off.

00:53:50.730 --> 00:53:54.570
We started off with this kind
of layered solution, which

00:53:54.570 --> 00:53:58.360
said we were going to quantize
these things into a finite

00:53:58.360 --> 00:54:00.200
alphabet and then
we were going to

00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:04.870
discrete code them, OK?

00:54:04.870 --> 00:54:06.890
And here what we've been
doing for awhile,

00:54:06.890 --> 00:54:09.250
and none of you objected.

00:54:09.250 --> 00:54:12.800
Of course, it's hard to object
at 9:30 in the morning.

00:54:12.800 --> 00:54:17.020
You just listen and you -- but
you should have objected.

00:54:17.020 --> 00:54:20.230
You should have said why in hell
am I choosing the number

00:54:20.230 --> 00:54:24.360
of quantization levels
to minimize over?

00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:26.830
What should I be minimizing
over?

00:54:26.830 --> 00:54:31.510
I should be trying to find the
minimum mean square error

00:54:31.510 --> 00:54:37.050
conditional on the entropy
of this output alphabet.

00:54:37.050 --> 00:54:39.900
Because the entropy of the
output alphabet is what

00:54:39.900 --> 00:54:45.020
determines what I can accomplish
by discrete coding.

00:54:45.020 --> 00:54:49.080
That's a slightly phony problem
because I'm insisting,

00:54:49.080 --> 00:54:56.360
now at least to start with, that
the quantizer is a scalar

00:54:56.360 --> 00:55:01.330
quantizer, and by using coding
here, I'm allowing memory in

00:55:01.330 --> 00:55:03.170
the coding process.

00:55:03.170 --> 00:55:06.860
But it's not that phony
because, in fact, this

00:55:06.860 --> 00:55:10.680
quantization job is a real
mess, and this job

00:55:10.680 --> 00:55:13.770
is very, very easy.

00:55:13.770 --> 00:55:15.930
And, in fact, when you think
about it a little bit, you

00:55:15.930 --> 00:55:23.210
say, OK, how do people really
do this if they're trying to

00:55:23.210 --> 00:55:25.180
implement things?

00:55:25.180 --> 00:55:28.230
And how would you go about
implementing something like

00:55:28.230 --> 00:55:32.660
this entire problem that
we're talking about?

00:55:32.660 --> 00:55:34.790
What would you do if you
had to implement it?

00:55:38.250 --> 00:55:41.940
Well, you're probably afraid to
say it, but you would use

00:55:41.940 --> 00:55:45.040
digital signal processing,
wouldn't you?

00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:47.550
I mean, the first thing you
would try to do is to get rid

00:55:47.550 --> 00:55:52.790
of all these analog values, and
you would try to turn them

00:55:52.790 --> 00:55:57.560
into discrete values, so that
you would really, after you

00:55:57.560 --> 00:56:02.200
somehow find this sequence of
numbers here, you would go

00:56:02.200 --> 00:56:05.030
through a quantizer and quantize
these numbers very,

00:56:05.030 --> 00:56:06.890
very finely.

00:56:06.890 --> 00:56:11.810
You would think of them as real
numbers, and then you

00:56:11.810 --> 00:56:15.470
would do some kind of discrete
coding, and you would wind up

00:56:15.470 --> 00:56:16.310
with something.

00:56:16.310 --> 00:56:20.820
And then you would say, ah, I
have quantized these things

00:56:20.820 --> 00:56:22.660
very, very finely.

00:56:22.660 --> 00:56:25.350
And we'll see that when you
quantize it very, very finely,

00:56:25.350 --> 00:56:30.310
what you're going to wind up
with, which is almost optimal,

00:56:30.310 --> 00:56:34.880
is a uniform scalar quantizer,
which is just what a

00:56:34.880 --> 00:56:39.060
garden-variety analog-to-digital
converter

00:56:39.060 --> 00:56:42.180
does for you, OK?

00:56:42.180 --> 00:56:44.490
But then you say, aha!

00:56:44.490 --> 00:56:46.920
What I can't do at that moment,
I don't have enough

00:56:46.920 --> 00:56:52.220
bits to represent what this very
fine quantizer has done.

00:56:52.220 --> 00:56:55.820
So then I think of this
quantization as real numbers.

00:56:55.820 --> 00:56:59.500
I go through the same process
again, and I think of then

00:56:59.500 --> 00:57:01.740
quantizing the real numbers
to the number of

00:57:01.740 --> 00:57:04.710
bits I really want.

00:57:04.710 --> 00:57:08.190
Anybody catch what
I just said?

00:57:08.190 --> 00:57:11.020
I'm saying you do this
in two steps.

00:57:11.020 --> 00:57:15.630
The first step is a very fine
quantization, strictly for

00:57:15.630 --> 00:57:20.440
implementation purposes and
for no other reason.

00:57:20.440 --> 00:57:24.460
And at that point, you
have bits to process.

00:57:24.460 --> 00:57:27.880
You do digital-signal
processing, but you think of

00:57:27.880 --> 00:57:31.300
those bits as representing
numbers, OK?

00:57:31.300 --> 00:57:34.430
In other words, as far as your
thoughts are concerned, you're

00:57:34.430 --> 00:57:36.970
not dealing with the
quantization errors that

00:57:36.970 --> 00:57:38.360
occurred here at all.

00:57:38.360 --> 00:57:40.730
You're just thinking
of real numbers.

00:57:40.730 --> 00:57:43.960
And at that point, you try to
design conceptually what it is

00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:47.020
you want to do in this
process of quantizing

00:57:47.020 --> 00:57:49.420
and discrete coding.

00:57:49.420 --> 00:57:52.800
And you then go back to looking
at these things as

00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:55.750
numbers again, and you quantize
them again, and you

00:57:55.750 --> 00:57:59.560
discrete encode them again in
whatever way makes sense.

00:57:59.560 --> 00:58:02.730
So you do one thing strictly for
implementation purposes.

00:58:02.730 --> 00:58:05.600
You do the other thing for
conceptual purposes.

00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:08.050
Then you put them together into
something that works.

00:58:08.050 --> 00:58:12.390
And that's the way engineers
operate all the time, I think.

00:58:12.390 --> 00:58:15.880
At least they did when I was
more active doing real

00:58:15.880 --> 00:58:17.910
engineering.

00:58:17.910 --> 00:58:23.530
OK, so that's that.

00:58:23.530 --> 00:58:26.870
But anyway, it says finding a
minimum mean square error

00:58:26.870 --> 00:58:30.620
quantizer for fixed M isn't the
right problem that we're

00:58:30.620 --> 00:58:32.910
interested in.

00:58:32.910 --> 00:58:34.660
If you're going to have
quantization followed by

00:58:34.660 --> 00:58:38.150
discrete coding, the quantizer
should minimize mean square

00:58:38.150 --> 00:58:43.460
error for fixed representation
point entropy.

00:58:43.460 --> 00:58:45.670
In other words, I'd
want to find these

00:58:45.670 --> 00:58:47.460
representation points.

00:58:47.460 --> 00:58:49.720
It's important what the
numerical values of the

00:58:49.720 --> 00:58:54.380
representation points are for
mean square error, but I'm not

00:58:54.380 --> 00:58:56.480
interested in how many
of them I have.

00:58:56.480 --> 00:59:00.120
What I'm interested in is
the entropy of them.

00:59:00.120 --> 00:59:04.900
OK, so the quantizer should
minimize mean square error for

00:59:04.900 --> 00:59:07.810
a fixed representation
point entropy.

00:59:07.810 --> 00:59:12.570
I would like some algorithm,
which goes through and changes

00:59:12.570 --> 00:59:16.110
my representation points,
including perhaps changing the

00:59:16.110 --> 00:59:18.960
number of representation
points as a

00:59:18.960 --> 00:59:21.530
way of reducing entropy.

00:59:21.530 --> 00:59:25.240
OK, sometimes you can get more
representation points by

00:59:25.240 --> 00:59:28.830
having them out where there's
virtually no probability, and

00:59:28.830 --> 00:59:32.460
therefore they don't happen very
often, but when they do

00:59:32.460 --> 00:59:34.640
happen, they sure save
you an awful lot

00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:36.390
of mean square error.

00:59:36.390 --> 00:59:40.320
So you can wind up with things
using many, many more

00:59:40.320 --> 00:59:43.800
quantization points than you
would think you would want

00:59:43.800 --> 00:59:48.270
because that's the optimal
thing to do.

00:59:48.270 --> 00:59:52.470
OK, when you're given the
regions, if we try to say what

00:59:52.470 --> 00:59:56.140
happens to the Lloyd-Max
algorithm then, the

00:59:56.140 --> 00:59:58.720
representation points
should still be

00:59:58.720 --> 01:00:00.420
the conditional means.

01:00:00.420 --> 01:00:01.670
Why?

01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:11.730
Anybody figure out why we want
to solve the problem that way?

01:00:11.730 --> 01:00:18.800
If I've already figured out what
the region should the --

01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:23.760
well, before, when I told you
what the regions were, you

01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:27.250
told me that you wanted to make
the representation points

01:00:27.250 --> 01:00:29.670
the conditional means.

01:00:29.670 --> 01:00:31.570
Now if I make the representation
points

01:00:31.570 --> 01:00:36.350
something other than the
conditional means, what's

01:00:36.350 --> 01:00:37.600
going to happen to
the entropy?

01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:43.730
The entropy stays the same.

01:00:43.730 --> 01:00:45.480
The entropy has nothing
to do with what

01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:48.260
you call these symbols.

01:00:48.260 --> 01:00:51.760
I can move where they are, but
they still have the same

01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:56.800
probability because they still
occur whenever you wind up in

01:00:56.800 --> 01:00:59.670
that region.

01:00:59.670 --> 01:01:02.630
And therefore, the entropy
doesn't change, and therefore,

01:01:02.630 --> 01:01:06.520
the same rule holds.

01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:10.060
But now the peculiar thing is
you don't want to make the

01:01:10.060 --> 01:01:14.150
representation regions Voronoi
regions anymore.

01:01:14.150 --> 01:01:17.290
In other words, sometimes you
want to make a region much

01:01:17.290 --> 01:01:20.630
closer to one point than
to the other point.

01:01:20.630 --> 01:01:22.880
And why do you want
to do that?

01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:25.210
Because you'd like to make these
probabilities of the

01:01:25.210 --> 01:01:28.850
points as unequal as you can
because you're trying to

01:01:28.850 --> 01:01:30.570
reduce entropy.

01:01:30.570 --> 01:01:33.540
And you can reduce entropy by
making things have different

01:01:33.540 --> 01:01:36.230
probabilities.

01:01:36.230 --> 01:01:40.740
OK, so that's where we
wind up with that.

01:01:40.740 --> 01:01:43.140
I would like to say there's
a nice algorithm

01:01:43.140 --> 01:01:45.070
to solve this problem.

01:01:45.070 --> 01:01:46.670
There isn't.

01:01:46.670 --> 01:01:49.060
It's an incredibly
ugly problem.

01:01:49.060 --> 01:01:52.230
You might think it makes sense
to use a Lagrange multiplier

01:01:52.230 --> 01:01:56.100
approach and try to minimize
some linear combination of

01:01:56.100 --> 01:02:00.660
entropy and mean square error.

01:02:00.660 --> 01:02:03.710
I've never been able
to make it work.

01:02:03.710 --> 01:02:08.860
So anyway, let's go on.

01:02:13.730 --> 01:02:17.220
When we want to look at a
high-rate quantizer, which is

01:02:17.220 --> 01:02:22.350
what we very often want, you
can do a very simple

01:02:22.350 --> 01:02:24.450
approximation.

01:02:24.450 --> 01:02:28.740
And the simple approximation
makes the problem much easier,

01:02:28.740 --> 01:02:31.020
and it gives you an
added benefit.

01:02:31.020 --> 01:02:34.130
There's something called
differential entropy.

01:02:34.130 --> 01:02:38.530
And differential entropy is the
same as ordinary entropy,

01:02:38.530 --> 01:02:42.300
except instead of dealing with
probabilities, it deals with

01:02:42.300 --> 01:02:45.440
probability densities.

01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:49.030
And you look at this, and you
say, well, that's virtually

01:02:49.030 --> 01:02:53.570
the same thing, and it looks
like the same thing.

01:02:53.570 --> 01:02:56.020
And to most physicists, most
physicists look at something

01:02:56.020 --> 01:03:00.135
like this, and physicists who
are into statistical mechanics

01:03:00.135 --> 01:03:01.990
say, oh, of course that's
the same thing.

01:03:01.990 --> 01:03:04.400
There's no fundamental
difference between a

01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:08.650
differential entropy
and a real entropy.

01:03:08.650 --> 01:03:10.790
And you say, well, but
they're all these

01:03:10.790 --> 01:03:11.600
scaling issues there.

01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:15.060
And they say, blah, that's
not important.

01:03:15.060 --> 01:03:17.035
And they're right, because once
you understand it, it's

01:03:17.035 --> 01:03:19.160
not important.

01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:25.670
But let's look and see what the
similarities and what the

01:03:25.670 --> 01:03:26.920
differences are.

01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:34.130
And I'll think in terms of, in
fact, a quantization problem,

01:03:34.130 --> 01:03:38.410
where I'm taking this
continuous-valued random

01:03:38.410 --> 01:03:42.250
variable with density, and I'm
quantizing it into a set of

01:03:42.250 --> 01:03:44.110
discrete points.

01:03:44.110 --> 01:03:47.750
And I want to say what's the
difference between this

01:03:47.750 --> 01:03:52.630
differential entropy here and
this discrete entropy, which

01:03:52.630 --> 01:03:55.410
we sort of understand by now.

01:03:55.410 --> 01:03:59.760
Well, things that are the same
-- the first thing that's the

01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:04.830
same is the differential entropy
is still the expected

01:04:04.830 --> 01:04:09.980
value of minus the logarithm
of the probability density.

01:04:13.830 --> 01:04:16.340
OK, we found that that was
useful before when we were

01:04:16.340 --> 01:04:17.840
trying to understand
the entropy.

01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:22.180
It's the expected value
of a log pmf.

01:04:22.180 --> 01:04:27.020
Now the differential entropy is
expected value of a log pdf

01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:30.180
instead of pmf.

01:04:30.180 --> 01:04:35.350
And the entropy of two random
variables, U1 and U2, if

01:04:35.350 --> 01:04:40.020
they're independent, is just the
differential entropy of U1

01:04:40.020 --> 01:04:42.940
plus the differential
entropy of U2.

01:04:42.940 --> 01:04:43.980
How do I see that?

01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:45.160
You just write it down.

01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:46.790
You write down these
joint densities.

01:04:46.790 --> 01:04:48.150
You write down this.

01:04:48.150 --> 01:04:53.650
The logarithm of the joint
density for IID splits into a

01:04:53.650 --> 01:04:55.580
product of densities.

01:04:55.580 --> 01:04:59.210
A log of a product is
the sum of the logs.

01:04:59.210 --> 01:05:01.380
It's the same as the
argument before.

01:05:01.380 --> 01:05:06.940
In other words, it's not only
that this is the same as the

01:05:06.940 --> 01:05:09.270
answer that we got before,
but the argument

01:05:09.270 --> 01:05:11.560
is exactly the same.

01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:15.440
And the other thing, the next
thing is if you shift this

01:05:15.440 --> 01:05:16.800
density here.

01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:20.045
If I have a density, which is
going along here and I shift

01:05:20.045 --> 01:05:23.410
it over to here and have a
density over there, the

01:05:23.410 --> 01:05:25.510
entropy is the same again.

01:05:25.510 --> 01:05:28.930
Because this entropy is just
fundamentally not -- it

01:05:28.930 --> 01:05:32.230
doesn't have to do with where
you happen to be.

01:05:32.230 --> 01:05:35.520
It has to do with what these
probability densities are.

01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:40.320
And you can stick that shift
into here, and if you're very

01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:45.140
good at doing calculus, you can,
in fact, see that when

01:05:45.140 --> 01:05:49.770
you put a shift in here, you
still get the same entropy.

01:05:49.770 --> 01:05:53.390
I couldn't do that at this
point, but I'm sure that all

01:05:53.390 --> 01:05:55.100
of you can.

01:05:55.100 --> 01:05:56.830
And I can do it if
I spent enough

01:05:56.830 --> 01:05:58.000
time thinking it through.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:01.600
It would just take me longer
than most of you.

01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:05.690
OK, so all of these things
are still true.

01:06:05.690 --> 01:06:07.300
There a couple of
very disturbing

01:06:07.300 --> 01:06:10.590
differences, though.

01:06:10.590 --> 01:06:13.450
And the first difference
is that h of U

01:06:13.450 --> 01:06:14.700
is not scale invariant.

01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:19.800
And, in fact, if it were
scale invariant, it

01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:22.690
would be totally useless.

01:06:22.690 --> 01:06:25.610
The fact that it's not scale
invariant turns out to be very

01:06:25.610 --> 01:06:29.850
important when you try
to understand it, OK?

01:06:29.850 --> 01:06:36.890
In other words, if you stretch
this probability density by

01:06:36.890 --> 01:06:40.930
some quantity a, then your
probability density, which

01:06:40.930 --> 01:06:44.570
looks like this, shifts
like this.

01:06:44.570 --> 01:06:47.990
It shifts down and
it shifts out.

01:06:47.990 --> 01:06:52.790
So the log of the
pmf gets bigger.

01:06:52.790 --> 01:06:56.450
The pmf itself is just
sort of spread out.

01:06:56.450 --> 01:06:59.280
It does what you would
expect it to do, and

01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:01.090
that works very nicely.

01:07:01.090 --> 01:07:04.630
But the log of the pmf has this
extra term which comes in

01:07:04.630 --> 01:07:08.470
here, which is a factor of a.

01:07:08.470 --> 01:07:12.400
And it turns out you can just
factor that factor of a out,

01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:17.730
and you wind up with the
differential entropy of a

01:07:17.730 --> 01:07:22.590
scaled random variable U is
equal to the differential

01:07:22.590 --> 01:07:30.760
entropy of the original U plus
log of a, which might be

01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:32.010
minus log of a.

01:07:34.610 --> 01:07:36.280
I'm not sure which it is.

01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:38.780
I'll write down plus
or minus log of a.

01:07:38.780 --> 01:07:42.450
It's one or the other.

01:07:42.450 --> 01:07:45.240
I don't care at this point.

01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:47.260
All I'm interested
in is that you

01:07:47.260 --> 01:07:50.130
recognize that it's different.

01:07:50.130 --> 01:07:52.860
An even more disturbing point
is this differential entropy

01:07:52.860 --> 01:07:54.280
can be negative.

01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:55.830
It can be negative
or positive.

01:07:55.830 --> 01:07:59.720
It can do whatever
it wants to do.

01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:05.540
And so we're left with a sort
of a peculiar thing.

01:08:05.540 --> 01:08:09.860
But we say, well, all right,
that's the way it is.

01:08:09.860 --> 01:08:11.410
The physicists had
to deal with that

01:08:11.410 --> 01:08:14.050
for many, many years.

01:08:14.050 --> 01:08:19.410
And the physicists, who think
about it all the time, deal

01:08:19.410 --> 01:08:22.470
with it and say it's
not very important.

01:08:22.470 --> 01:08:26.980
So we'll say, OK, we'll go along
with this unless asked:

01:08:26.980 --> 01:08:31.310
What happens if we try to build
a uniform high-rate

01:08:31.310 --> 01:08:35.100
scalar quantizer, which is
exactly what you would do for

01:08:35.100 --> 01:08:38.670
implementation purposes
anyway.

01:08:38.670 --> 01:08:40.550
So how does this work?

01:08:40.550 --> 01:08:43.380
You pick a little tiny delta.

01:08:43.380 --> 01:08:45.920
You have all these
regions here.

01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:50.090
And by uniform, I mean you make
all the regions the same.

01:08:50.090 --> 01:08:52.750
I mean, conceptually, this might
mean having accountably

01:08:52.750 --> 01:08:54.150
infinite number of regions.

01:08:54.150 --> 01:08:57.610
Let's not worry about that
for the time being.

01:08:57.610 --> 01:09:01.130
And you have points in here,
which are the conditional

01:09:01.130 --> 01:09:04.310
means of the regions.

01:09:04.310 --> 01:09:11.020
Well, if I assume that delta is
small, then the probability

01:09:11.020 --> 01:09:14.960
density of u is almost constant
within a region, if

01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:17.970
it really is a density.

01:09:17.970 --> 01:09:23.800
And I can define an average
value of f of u within each

01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:25.350
region in the following way.

01:09:25.350 --> 01:09:28.070
It's easier to see what it is
graphically if I have a

01:09:28.070 --> 01:09:31.220
density here, which runs
along like this.

01:09:33.810 --> 01:09:39.930
And within each region, I will
choose f-bar of u to be a

01:09:39.930 --> 01:09:47.630
piecewise constant version of
this density, which might be

01:09:47.630 --> 01:09:49.620
like that, OK?

01:09:49.620 --> 01:09:51.610
Now that's just analytical
stuff to make

01:09:51.610 --> 01:09:53.980
things come out right.

01:09:53.980 --> 01:09:58.300
If you read the notes about how
to do this, you find out

01:09:58.300 --> 01:10:02.060
that this quantity is important
analytically to

01:10:02.060 --> 01:10:04.270
trace through what's going on.

01:10:04.270 --> 01:10:07.510
I think for the level that we're
at now, it's fine to

01:10:07.510 --> 01:10:13.380
just say, OK, this is the same
as this, if we make the

01:10:13.380 --> 01:10:16.190
quantization very small.

01:10:16.190 --> 01:10:18.350
I mean, at some point in this
argument, you want to go

01:10:18.350 --> 01:10:21.420
through and say, OK, what do
I mean by approximate?

01:10:21.420 --> 01:10:23.340
Is the approximation close?

01:10:23.340 --> 01:10:27.520
How does the approximation
become better as I make delta

01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:29.440
smaller, and all of
these questions.

01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:35.050
But let's just now say, OK, this
is the same as that, and

01:10:35.050 --> 01:10:39.710
I'd like to find out how well
this uniform high-rate scalar

01:10:39.710 --> 01:10:40.960
quantizer does.

01:10:44.470 --> 01:10:49.610
So my high-rate approximation
is that this average density

01:10:49.610 --> 01:10:53.870
is the same as the true
density and for

01:10:53.870 --> 01:10:56.290
all possible u.

01:10:56.290 --> 01:11:02.760
So conditional on u and Rj,
this quantity is constant.

01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:07.770
It's constant and equal to 1
over delta, and the actual

01:11:07.770 --> 01:11:10.860
density is approximately
equal to 1 over delta.

01:11:10.860 --> 01:11:11.590
What's that mean?

01:11:11.590 --> 01:11:14.510
It means that the mean square
error in one of these

01:11:14.510 --> 01:11:19.500
quantization regions is our
usual delta squared over 12,

01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:22.850
which is the mean square error
of a uniform density in a

01:11:22.850 --> 01:11:26.530
region from minus delta over
2 to plus delta over 2.

01:11:26.530 --> 01:11:28.550
So that's the mean
square error.

01:11:28.550 --> 01:11:30.010
You can't do anything
with that.

01:11:30.010 --> 01:11:32.680
You're stuck with it.

01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:36.650
The next question is
what is the entropy

01:11:36.650 --> 01:11:39.880
as a quantizer output?

01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:42.760
I'm sorry, I'm giving a typical
MIT lecture today,

01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:46.780
which people have characterized
as a fire hose,

01:11:46.780 --> 01:11:51.130
and it's because I want to get
done with this material today.

01:11:51.130 --> 01:11:53.680
I think if you read the notes
afterwards, you've got a

01:11:53.680 --> 01:11:57.010
pretty good picture of
what's going on.

01:11:57.010 --> 01:11:59.300
We are not going to have
an enormous number

01:11:59.300 --> 01:12:00.380
of problems on this.

01:12:00.380 --> 01:12:03.295
It's not something we're
stressing so I want to get you

01:12:03.295 --> 01:12:07.280
to have some idea of what
this is all about.

01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:10.830
This slide is probably the most
important slide because

01:12:10.830 --> 01:12:13.640
it tells you what this
differential

01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:15.390
entropy really is.

01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:22.070
OK, I'm going to look at the
probabilities of each of these

01:12:22.070 --> 01:12:27.680
discrete points now. p sub j
is the probability that the

01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:30.990
quantizer will get the
point a sub j.

01:12:30.990 --> 01:12:33.260
In other words, it is the
probability of the

01:12:33.260 --> 01:12:35.790
region R sub j.

01:12:35.790 --> 01:12:40.320
And that's just the integral
of the probability density

01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:41.490
over the j-th region.

01:12:41.490 --> 01:12:46.450
Namely, it's the probability of
being in that j-th region.

01:12:46.450 --> 01:12:52.080
p sub j is also equal to this
average value times delta.

01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:55.090
OK, so I look at what
the entropy is of

01:12:55.090 --> 01:12:57.610
the high-rate quantizer.

01:12:57.610 --> 01:13:02.450
It's the sum of minus
pj log pj.

01:13:02.450 --> 01:13:07.090
I translate that pj is
equal to this, so I

01:13:07.090 --> 01:13:08.900
have a sum over j.

01:13:08.900 --> 01:13:15.850
I have an integral minus a fU of
u, which is that, times log

01:13:15.850 --> 01:13:19.200
And now I'll use this quantity
instead of this quantity.

01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:22.440
f-bar of u times delta du.

01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:25.660
OK, in other words, these
probabilities are scaled by

01:13:25.660 --> 01:13:27.560
delta, which is what I was
telling you before.

01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:30.330
That's the crucial thing here.

01:13:30.330 --> 01:13:33.790
As you make delta smaller and
smaller, the probabilities of

01:13:33.790 --> 01:13:37.510
the intervals go down
with delta.

01:13:37.510 --> 01:13:41.810
OK, so I break this up
into two terms now.

01:13:41.810 --> 01:13:47.230
I take out the log of delta,
which is integrated over fU.

01:13:47.230 --> 01:13:49.200
I have this quantity left.

01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:52.670
This quantity is approximately
equal to the density, and what

01:13:52.670 --> 01:13:56.380
I wind up with is that the
actual entropy of the

01:13:56.380 --> 01:14:00.680
quantized version is equal to
the differential entropy minus

01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:04.010
the log of delta at high rate.

01:14:04.010 --> 01:14:07.550
OK, that's the only way I know
to interpret differential

01:14:07.550 --> 01:14:11.750
entropy that makes any sense,
OK, in other words, usually

01:14:11.750 --> 01:14:14.120
when you think of integrals,
you think of them

01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:15.190
in a Riemann sense.

01:14:15.190 --> 01:14:18.160
You think of breaking up the
interval into lots of very

01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:22.530
thin slices with delta, and then
you integrate things by

01:14:22.530 --> 01:14:26.250
adding up things, and that
integral then is then a sum.

01:14:26.250 --> 01:14:28.600
It's the same as this
kind of sum.

01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:30.990
And the integral that you wind
up with when you're dealing

01:14:30.990 --> 01:14:36.110
with a log of the pmf, you
get this extra delta

01:14:36.110 --> 01:14:40.550
sticking in there, OK?

01:14:40.550 --> 01:14:48.640
So this entropy is this phony
thing minus log of delta.

01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:52.650
As I quantize more and
more finely, this

01:14:52.650 --> 01:14:55.020
entropy keeps going up.

01:14:55.020 --> 01:14:58.990
It goes up because when delta is
very, very small, minus log

01:14:58.990 --> 01:15:01.590
delta is a large number.

01:15:01.590 --> 01:15:05.900
So as delta gets smaller and
smaller, this entropy heads

01:15:05.900 --> 01:15:08.330
off towards infinity.

01:15:08.330 --> 01:15:12.030
And in fact, you would expect
that because if you take a

01:15:12.030 --> 01:15:16.150
real number, which has a
distribution which is -- well,

01:15:16.150 --> 01:15:21.470
anything just between minus 1
and plus 1, for example, and I

01:15:21.470 --> 01:15:25.250
want to represent it very, very
well if it's uniformly

01:15:25.250 --> 01:15:28.670
distributed there, the better
I try to represent it, the

01:15:28.670 --> 01:15:30.800
more bits it takes.

01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:33.580
That's what this is saying.

01:15:33.580 --> 01:15:37.680
This thing is changing as I try
to represent things better

01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:39.350
and better.

01:15:39.350 --> 01:15:43.590
This quantity here is just some
funny thing that deals

01:15:43.590 --> 01:15:45.790
with the shape of the
probability density and

01:15:45.790 --> 01:15:48.040
nothing else.

01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:53.180
It essentially has a scale
factor built into it because

01:15:53.180 --> 01:15:56.690
the probability density has a
scale factor built into it.

01:15:56.690 --> 01:16:02.270
A probability density is
probability per unit length.

01:16:02.270 --> 01:16:08.500
And therefore, this kind of
entropy has to have that unit

01:16:08.500 --> 01:16:11.490
length coming in here somehow,
and that's the

01:16:11.490 --> 01:16:13.380
way it comes in.

01:16:13.380 --> 01:16:14.630
That's the way it is.

01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:25.050
So to summarize all of that, and
I'm sure you haven't quite

01:16:25.050 --> 01:16:30.050
understood all of it, but if
you do efficient discrete

01:16:30.050 --> 01:16:35.240
coding at the end of the whole
thing, the number of bits per

01:16:35.240 --> 01:16:40.545
sample, namely, per number
coming into the quantizer that

01:16:40.545 --> 01:16:44.030
you need, is H of V, OK?

01:16:44.030 --> 01:16:52.510
With this uniform quantizer,
which produces an entropy of

01:16:52.510 --> 01:16:56.530
the symbols H of V, then you
L-bar bits per symbol to

01:16:56.530 --> 01:16:57.470
represent that.

01:16:57.470 --> 01:17:00.110
That's the result that
we had before.

01:17:03.300 --> 01:17:08.870
This quantity H of V depends
only on delta and h of U.

01:17:08.870 --> 01:17:14.920
Namely, h of U is equal to
H of V plus log delta.

01:17:14.920 --> 01:17:17.160
So, in other words,
analytically, the only thing

01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:20.120
you have to worry about
is what is this

01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:21.880
differential entropy?

01:17:21.880 --> 01:17:25.310
You can't interpret what it is,
but you can calculate it.

01:17:25.310 --> 01:17:28.660
And once you calculate it,
this tells you what this

01:17:28.660 --> 01:17:31.630
entropy is for every
choice of delta so

01:17:31.630 --> 01:17:34.240
long as delta is small.

01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:38.530
It says that when you get to the
point where delta is small

01:17:38.530 --> 01:17:42.690
and the probability density is
essentially constant over a

01:17:42.690 --> 01:17:46.360
region, if I want to make delta
half as big as it was

01:17:46.360 --> 01:17:49.700
before, then I'm going to wind
up with twice as many

01:17:49.700 --> 01:17:51.270
quantization regions.

01:17:51.270 --> 01:17:52.990
They're all going to
be only half as

01:17:52.990 --> 01:17:55.000
probable as the ones before.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:56.660
It's going to take me
one extra bit to

01:17:56.660 --> 01:17:59.550
represent that, OK?

01:17:59.550 --> 01:18:03.930
Namely, this one extra bit for
each of these old regions is

01:18:03.930 --> 01:18:07.110
going to tell me whether I'm on
the right side or the left

01:18:07.110 --> 01:18:13.220
side of that old quantization
region to talk about the new

01:18:13.220 --> 01:18:14.310
quantization region.

01:18:14.310 --> 01:18:17.280
So this all make sense, OK?

01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:19.770
Namely, the only thing that's
happening as you make the

01:18:19.770 --> 01:18:25.270
quantization finer and finer is
that you have these extra

01:18:25.270 --> 01:18:28.580
bits coming in, which are sort
of telling you what the fine

01:18:28.580 --> 01:18:30.540
structure is.

01:18:30.540 --> 01:18:34.930
And little h of U already has
built into it the overall

01:18:34.930 --> 01:18:38.280
shape of the thing.

01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:42.850
OK, now I've added one thing
more here, which I haven't

01:18:42.850 --> 01:18:44.450
talked about at all.

01:18:44.450 --> 01:18:50.440
This uniform scalar quantizer
in fact becomes optimal as

01:18:50.440 --> 01:18:53.440
delta become small.

01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:56.830
And that's not obvious;
it's not intuitive.

01:18:56.830 --> 01:18:59.070
There's an argument
in the text that

01:18:59.070 --> 01:19:00.410
shows why that is true.

01:19:00.410 --> 01:19:05.680
It uses a Lagrange multiplier
to do it.

01:19:05.680 --> 01:19:09.210
I guess there's a certain
elegance to it.

01:19:09.210 --> 01:19:12.310
I mean, after years of thinking
about it, I would

01:19:12.310 --> 01:19:14.590
say, yeah, it's pretty likely
that it's true if I didn't

01:19:14.590 --> 01:19:17.670
have the mathematics
to know it's true.

01:19:17.670 --> 01:19:20.700
But, in fact, it's a very
interesting result.

01:19:20.700 --> 01:19:26.760
It says that what you do with
classical a to z converters,

01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:29.320
if you're going to have very
fine quantization, is, in

01:19:29.320 --> 01:19:31.780
fact, the right thing to do.
