00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.380
PROFESSOR: Let's get
started then.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.260
We went through Rayleigh
fading very, very

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.200
quickly last time.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.110
I want to spend a little more
time on it today since it's

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.950
one of the sort of classical
models of wireless channels.

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.400
And it's good to understand
how it works.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.070
And it's good to also understand
what all the

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.260
assumptions that are made when
one assumes Rayleigh fading,

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.220
because they're really
quite a few of them.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.560
OK, so what we're doing is we're
assuming flat fading.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.960
In other words when we talk
about flat fading, we're

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.830
talking about fading where if
you generate a discrete model

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.500
for the channel, that discrete
model is just going to have

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.280
one path in it.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.460
In other words, the output is
going to look like a faded

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.290
version of the input.

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.700
It'll be shifted in phase
because of the unknown phase

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:22.760
in the channel.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.770
It'll be attenuated by
some random amount.

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.590
But if you look at the waveform,
it'll look like the

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.860
waveform that you transmitted
except for the noise.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.070
And that's what really is
represented by this one tap

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.260
model that we've been
looking at.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.980
In general we've said that you
can model a pretty arbitrary

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.590
channel for purposes of
somewhat narrow band

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:56.070
communication by using a
sequence of taps where usually

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.510
for want of something better to
do, we model those taps as

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.800
being Gaussian random variables,
complex Gaussian

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:13.630
random variables with zero mean,
and variables which are

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.340
circularly symmetric.

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.350
And we assume for not any very
good reason, that the taps are

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.100
independent of each other.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.370
I mean we have to make some
assumptions or we can't start

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.490
to make any progress on trying
to analyze these channels.

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.830
But we should realize that all
of these assumptions are

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.940
subject to a certain
amount of question.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:34.300
OK.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:42.760
When we assume a single tap
model, and these tap models

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.630
are always given with the number
of the tap given first,

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.340
and the time given second.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.760
So what we're assuming here
is the only tap is

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.580
the tap at time 0.

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.270
And it's at time 0 because we're
assuming the receiver

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.080
timing is locked at transmitter
timing.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.160
And we're just going to get
rid of the zero because

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.740
there's only one tap, and
call this G sub m.

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:08.210
We're also going to pretty much
assume that G sub m stays

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:10.270
relatively constant
for a relatively

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:11.560
long amount of time.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.680
Except as far as this analysis
of Rayleigh fading goes, we

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.890
don't have to assume that.

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.860
Because in fact, when we're
assuming Rayleigh fading, the

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.180
analysis that we're going to
follow, the receiver doesn't

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.960
know anything about the channel
at all, except that

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.980
it's a single tap model.

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.760
And therefore what the receiver
does is it goes

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.700
through maximum likelihood
detection assuming that that

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:45.010
single tap is just a complex
Gaussian random variable.

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.030
OK when you have a complex
Gaussian random variable as

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.060
you've seen in the problem sets
and we've noted a number

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:57.720
of times, the energy in that
complex Gaussian random

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.630
variable is exponential.

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:08.620
And the magnitude is just a
square root of the magnitude

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.310
squared, namely the energy.

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.460
And that has a Rayleigh
distribution which looks like

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:20.750
this, namely the probability
density of how much

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.210
response you get.

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.980
We'll base this law here.

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.810
And the phase of course, is
equally likely to be anything.

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.990
Namely the phase is uniform
and random.

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.610
This density looks like this.

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.910
I wanted to draw this so it
would emphasize the fact that

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.290
the magnitude is in fact,
always nonnegative.

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.830
But also to emphasize the fact
there's a whole lot of

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.670
probability down here
where there's

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:48.990
very, very little channel.

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.680
And this is in fact what gives
rise to the fact that if you

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:58.150
try to communicate over Rayleigh
fading, and you don't

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.860
make any use of diversity--
and we'll talk later about

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.290
diversity--

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:05.660
in fact you can't communicate
very well at all.

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:09.270
And that's because of this very
bad region here where the

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.230
channel is very badly faded.

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:16.210
You send a bit on this channel
which is very badly faded, and

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:18.010
there's nothing much the
receiver can do.

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:22.670
And that's the thing we
want to try to get a

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:24.000
real feeling for.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.970
OK so the output of the channel
when you put in an

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:31.230
input U sub m, and we'll think
of this as being a binary

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:33.470
digit for this time being.

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:37.830
So the output is going to be
the input times this tap

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.500
variable, which is this complex
Gaussian random

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:44.800
variable plus a noise random
variable, which we're also

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.330
assuming is complex Gaussian
and circularly symmetric.

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:53.020
OK so what we have, if you're
going to make two hypotheses

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.780
about two possible values of
U sub m, look at what this

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:58.790
random phase does here.

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:06.660
No matter what U sub m you
transmit in one epoch of time,

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:10.130
the channel is going to rotate
this around by a completely

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:11.420
random phase.

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:14.020
It's going to add a noise to
it which has a completely

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:15.330
random phase.

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:17.240
And the output is going
to come out.

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:21.530
And the output has a completely
random phase.

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:25.610
Namely the phase of the output
cannot possibly tell you

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:28.280
anything about what
input you're

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:29.980
putting into the channel.

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:34.530
OK so in other words, in this
model that we're using, the

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:37.990
phase is completely useless.

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:45.270
And if we want to talk about
anything connected to using

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:49.630
likelihoods, the only thing we
can use is the magnitude of

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:50.730
the output.

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:52.110
OK.

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:54.930
Now, why don't we just analyze
it in terms of the magnitude

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:56.060
of the output?

00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:00.360
Well when you analyze these
problems, Gaussian things are

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:05.680
usually much easier to analyze
than things like this.

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.590
Not always, I mean we
have to get used to

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:09.080
analyzing all of them.

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:12.400
But this particular problem of
Rayleigh fading is really

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.310
easier to analyze in
terms of these

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:16.220
Gaussian random variables.

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:19.510
But it's easier to understand
in terms of recognizing that

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:23.320
the only thing you can make any
use is these magnitudes.

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:32.040
OK if we only use one complex
degree of freedom in a signal,

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:37.540
namely if we try to send some
signal and we only use one

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:41.730
input to the channel, then
we only get one output.

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:45.800
Namely we sent U sub
0, we get V sub 0.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:49.330
And we try to decide from
V sub 0 what was sent.

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:52.850
We're really in a very bad
pickle at that point.

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:56.050
Because the only thing that
makes any sense, since we can

00:07:56.050 --> 00:08:01.090
only use the magnitudes, is to
send a very small magnitude or

00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:03.530
a positive magnitude.

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:05.550
Magnitudes are positive
anyway.

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:08.170
So if you're going to send
binary signals, this is your

00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:11.520
only choice-- if it
makes any sense--

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:13.760
if you make this larger
than zero you're

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:15.980
just wasting energy.

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:18.060
So you only have this choice.

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:20.700
And you can choose the amplitude
a that you're using.

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:23.020
But that's the only thing
that you can do.

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:28.340
OK, this is a very nasty thing
to analyze for one thing.

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:29.820
It gives you a very large error

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:31.780
probability for another thing.

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:34.330
Nobody uses it for
another thing.

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:38.080
And therefore almost all systems
of trying to transmit

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:42.160
in this kind of Rayleigh fading,
always use at least

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:44.520
two sample values.

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:47.180
In other words, instead of
just putting one complex

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:49.970
degree of freedom into the
channel, you're going to put

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:52.930
two complex degrees of freedom
into the channel.

00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:55.860
And the thing that we're going
to analyze, because it's the

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:58.700
easiest thing to do in this
discrete time model we've

00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:03.930
developed, is to think of
modeling hypothesis 0 as

00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:08.320
sending two symbols U sub 0 and
U sub 1 will make U sub 0

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:12.380
equal to a, and U sub
1 equal to 0.

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:15.530
And the alternative case, if
we're going to try to send

00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:18.300
input 1, this is binary
transmission.

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:21.660
You can talk about more than
binary transmission, but

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:24.400
binary is awful enough.

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:27.680
You get U sub 0 and U sub
1 is equal to 0 and a.

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:31.480
So what you're going to
be doing here in this

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:35.030
pulse-position modulation, is
choosing one of these two

00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:38.040
different epochs to
put the data in.

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:41.000
So in one case, you put all your
energy in the first one.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.690
In the other case, you put all
your energy in the second one.

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:47.340
Mathematically, this is
completely equivalent to

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:50.190
frequency-shift keying, that's
completely equivalent to

00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:52.320
phase-shift keying.

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.740
And if we had a little
more time, we

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:55.890
could talk about that.

00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:58.750
And I'll probably put an
appendix in which talks about

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:00.020
those two systems.

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:02.310
But in fact, it's completely
the same thing.

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:04.810
It's just that you're using
different complex degrees of

00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:06.910
freedom than we're using here.

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:10.500
So we're really analyzing
FSK and PSK.

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:13.160
And that's where people usually
come up with these

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:17.240
analyses of Rayleigh fading.

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:25.000
OK when we have input 0, what
we receive then, is the 0 is

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.470
going to be the input a, times
the magnitude of the channel

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:32.060
of time 0, plus a
noise variable.

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:35.290
The noise is complex
Gaussian, remember.

00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:39.110
The second input is just going
to be the noise variable.

00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:42.120
Alternatively, if we're sending
the second symbol,

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:44.740
which means we put our energy
into the second degree of

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:48.440
freedom, it means that what
we're going to get is the 0

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:50.430
was just going to
be the noise.

00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:53.840
And the second output
is going to be the

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:56.020
signal plus the noise.

00:10:56.020 --> 00:11:00.740
And remember, both this variable
and this variable are

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:02.790
both complex Gaussian.

00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:04.390
The phase doesn't
mean anything.

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:10.080
So what we can use is simply
the magnitude.

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:16.250
OK, so when we have hypothesis
equal to 0, what comes out is

00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:20.710
going to be, the 0 is going
to be a complex

00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:22.120
Gaussian random variable.

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:24.920
Let me introduce a new piece
of notation now.

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:28.870
Because it gets to be a real
mess to constantly talk about

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:32.640
a Gaussian complex random
variable, and talk about it's

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:36.310
real part and imaginary part as
being independent Gaussian.

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:41.230
So I'll just call this
normal complex.

00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:44.550
And this first thing is the
mean, which is a real and

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:47.510
imaginary part, but it's
zero in most of the

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:48.980
things we deal with.

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:53.850
And the second one is the mean
square value of this random

00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:55.660
variable V sub zero.

00:11:55.660 --> 00:12:01.640
So this quantity here is now
twice the variance of the real

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:05.635
part of V sub 0, and twice
the imaginary part of

00:12:05.635 --> 00:12:09.910
the variance of v0.

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:14.170
We scaled the noise in
a peculiar way here.

00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:19.040
And I apologize for all
of the mess that

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:21.510
occurs when we do this.

00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:26.100
Because sometimes we think of
the noise as having variance N

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:29.720
sub 0 over 2 in each real and
imaginary degree of freedom.

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:33.310
And therefore N sub 0 in a
complex degree of freedom.

00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:37.560
And sometimes we think of it as
having variance N sub 0 W

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:39.930
Where does that difference
come from?

00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:44.060
It's this infernal problem of
the sampling theorem being so

00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:47.810
critical in most of the models
that we talk about.

00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:51.920
OK because when you use the
sampling theorem, the sinc x

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:56.080
over x waveforms that we use are
not orthonormal, they're

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:57.700
orthogonal.

00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:03.390
And this factor of W appears
exactly because of that.

00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:08.240
They appear because the
magnitude of the signal is a,

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:10.690
and the energy and
the power in the

00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:13.020
signal is then a-squared.

00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:13.910
OK.

00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:17.050
In this case the power in the
signal is not quite a-squared

00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:21.950
because we only send energy in
one or the other of alternate

00:13:21.950 --> 00:13:23.150
degrees of freedom.

00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:31.620
So therefore, if we look at a
time one second, we get W

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:33.810
complex degrees of
freedom to use.

00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:41.990
We only send energy in half of
those so that the actual power

00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:47.290
that we're sending is a-squared
divided by 2.

00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:47.730
OK.

00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:50.810
Because of that, when we
normalize the noise the same

00:13:50.810 --> 00:13:55.090
way the signal is normalized,
we get this

00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:57.600
variance W N sub 0.

00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:00.910
If you're confused by that,
everyone is confused by it.

00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:04.220
Everyone I know, when they go
through calculations like

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:07.410
this, they always start out
with some arbitrary fudge

00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:08.840
factor like this.

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:12.120
And after they get all done,
they think it through or more

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:14.785
likely they look it up in a book
to see what somebody else

00:14:14.785 --> 00:14:16.390
has gotten.

00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:19.100
And then they sweat about it a
little bit, and they finally

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:21.430
decide what it ought to be.

00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:23.190
And that's just the way it is.

00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:27.710
It's the problem of having both
the sampling theorem and

00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:29.800
orthonormal waveforms
sitting around.

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:34.400
It's also the problem of
multiplying the power by 2 as

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:36.110
soon as we go to passband.

00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:40.370
Because both of those things
together generate all of this

00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:41.090
difficulty.

00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:43.710
But anyway, this is
the way it is.

00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:47.820
And the important thing for us
is that what we can have now

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:49.950
is under these two hypotheses.

00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:53.300
We just have two Gaussian random
variables, complex

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:55.030
Gaussian random variables.

00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:59.690
And in one case, the larger mean
square value is in one.

00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:01.500
And in the other case the
larger mean square

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:02.910
value is in the other.

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:10.380
OK.

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:12.470
So just reviewing that.

00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:17.450
If H is equal to zero, V sub 0
and V sub 1 are these complex

00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:19.250
Gaussian random variables.

00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:23.590
If H is equal to one, then we
have this set of Gaussian

00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:25.190
random variables.

00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:29.560
The probability density of V
sub 0 and V sub 1, and now

00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:34.460
it's more convenient to use the
real and imaginary parts

00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:36.230
for the Gaussian density.

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:40.260
Anytime you're working problems
of this type, try

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:45.300
both densities using real and
imaginary parts, and using

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:49.300
magnitude in phase, and see
which one is easier.

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:52.400
Here it turns out that the
easiest thing is just to use

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:56.230
the ordinary conventional
density over real and

00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:58.060
imaginary parts.

00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:01.450
And what we wind up with is
this Gaussian density.

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:10.190
On V sub 0 the density is V sub
0 squared divided by the

00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:13.440
variance a-squared
plus W N sub 0.

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:18.760
And on V sub 1, it's this
Gaussian density V sub 1

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:21.250
squared divided by W N sub 0.

00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:23.920
Just because here we
have this variance.

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:26.330
Here we have this variance.

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:29.910
OK, on the alternative
hypothesis when H is equal to

00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:33.880
one, you have the same thing
but the denominators are

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:35.010
switched around.

00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:38.250
When you take the likelihood
ratio, you want to take the

00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:41.660
ratio of this, to the
ratio of this.

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:44.420
If you look at it and you take
the logarithm of that, you're

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:46.650
taking the ratio of
this to this.

00:16:46.650 --> 00:16:49.140
Incidentally the coefficient
here, you could write it out

00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:50.320
if you want to.

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:53.630
It's 1 over the square root of
blah, times 1 over the square

00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:54.700
root of blah.

00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:58.350
But if you recognize that the
coefficient here has to be the

00:16:58.350 --> 00:17:00.550
same as the coefficient
here, you don't have

00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:01.850
to worry about it.

00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:05.320
So when you take the log
likelihood ratio, you get this

00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:06.700
divided by this.

00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:08.790
You have the same form
in both cases.

00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:13.050
In one case, you have this term
minus this term and this

00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:14.840
term minus this term.

00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:24.340
And the other case well, for
V sub 0, you have this term

00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:25.480
minus this term.

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:28.830
And for V sub 1 you have this
term minus this term.

00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:31.440
Because of the symmetry between
the two, this just

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:34.230
comes out to V sub 0 squared
minus V sub 1

00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:36.010
squared times a-squared.

00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:39.040
And when you do the algebra, the
denominator is a-squared

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:43.330
plus W N sub 0 times
W N sub 0.

00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:43.850
OK.

00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:48.600
What do we do for making a
maximum likelihood decision?

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:53.150
Maximum likelihood is map when
the threshold is equal to 1,

00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:55.530
which is when the logarithm
of the correct

00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:57.510
threshold is equal 0.

00:17:57.510 --> 00:18:02.040
Which says that you take this
quantity, and if it's

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:07.550
nonnegative, you choose
H equals zero.

00:18:07.550 --> 00:18:10.490
And if it's negative, you
choose H equals one.

00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:15.200
Which says you compare V sub 0
squared and V sub 1 squared.

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:18.700
And whichever one is larger,
that's the one you choose.

00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:22.660
And if you go back and look at
the problem, it's pretty

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:25.650
obvious that that's what
you want to do anyway.

00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:27.770
I mean you'd be very, very
surprised when you're

00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:31.280
comparing two Gaussian random
variables where one of them

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:33.410
has a larger variance
than the other.

00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:35.490
And on the other hypothesis,
the absolon

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:38.650
has the larger variance.

00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:41.950
If you came up with any rule
other than to take the

00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:46.360
magnitude squares and to then
compare those two magnitude

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:49.410
squares, you would go back and
look at the problem again

00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:52.810
realizing you must have
done something wrong.

00:18:52.810 --> 00:18:57.960
But anyway when you deal with
problems like this, I advise

00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:01.430
you to take log likelihood
ratio anyway.

00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:04.800
Because every once in awhile you
find something which comes

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:07.430
out in a somewhat
peculiar way.

00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:10.370
But anyway, here there's
nothing peculiar.

00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:12.950
So what we have to do
now is to find the

00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:14.680
probability of error.

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:16.480
Now what's the probability
of error?

00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:34.250
OK if we actually transmit zero,
then V sub 0 squared is

00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:36.160
exponential.

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:42.600
It's exponential
with this mean.

00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:45.830
Namely this is the mean
of V sub 0 squared.

00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:48.710
And V sub 1 is exponential
with this mean.

00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:52.340
In other words, this is
a big exponential.

00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:54.310
And this is a little
exponential.

00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:57.370
The two of them have probability
densities that

00:19:57.370 --> 00:19:58.620
look like this.

00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:02.610
This is not going to work.

00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:11.620
The big one has a probability
density that looks like this.

00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:16.680
And the little one--

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:19.220
this is big--

00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:21.490
and the little one has
a probability density

00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:23.140
that looks like this.

00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:28.190
And what you want to do is to
subtract a random variable

00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:30.250
with this density from a random

00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:33.140
variable with this density.

00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:37.630
So you're convolving two
exponential densities with

00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:39.300
each other.

00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:42.860
And unfortunately, you're taking
the differences of two.

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:47.040
So you're convolving the
negatives of this with this.

00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:48.660
And then you have to integrate
the thing.

00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:53.290
And it's just something
you have to do.

00:20:53.290 --> 00:21:01.080
And the answer is, the
probability of error is then 2

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:05.570
plus a-squared over W N
sub 0 to the minus 1.

00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:08.250
OK that is really
an awful result.

00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:12.090
Because that says that if you
increase the energy that

00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:15.910
you're using, the probability of
error goes down very, very,

00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:17.390
very slowly.

00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:20.320
And if you look at this picture
you think about it a

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:23.490
little bit, it should be clear
that that's the only thing

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:26.050
that can happen.

00:21:26.050 --> 00:21:26.420
OK.

00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:30.660
Because if you increase
a-squared a little bit, it's

00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:32.970
not going to save
you much here.

00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:35.670
Because when you have a bigger
a-squared, it's just going to

00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:38.570
move down the value
of g bar that's

00:21:38.570 --> 00:21:39.960
going to give you trouble.

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:44.900
Namely when you double a, the
value of magnitude of g that

00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:48.130
gives you trouble just goes
down by a factor of two.

00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:52.850
When that goes down by a factor
two, this bad part of

00:21:52.850 --> 00:21:57.330
the curve just goes down
in a quadratic way.

00:21:57.330 --> 00:22:01.400
Well that's what this
is telling us.

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:03.730
OK.

00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:08.010
I mean the thing that we see
is a quadratic and a.

00:22:08.010 --> 00:22:10.590
So we're sort of assured that
we're doing the right thing.

00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:13.750
And we're sort of also assured
that the reason why this

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:17.370
result is so awful, is just that
sometimes the fading is

00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:21.640
so bad there's nothing
you can do about it.

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:23.790
OK now the signal power
as we said before is

00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:25.150
a-squared over 2.

00:22:25.150 --> 00:22:27.040
Since half the inputs
are zero.

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:29.710
So we can put twice as
much energy into the

00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:31.440
ones that are non-zero.

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:35.520
And therefore when you put this
in terms of the average

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:39.240
signal energy that you're
sending, what we get is E sub

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:41.070
b over N sub 0.

00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:42.020
OK.

00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:46.550
So that again says exactly the
same thing that this does.

00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:51.060
It's worthwhile keeping both
of these notions around,

00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:55.460
because we have done something
kind of peculiar here.

00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:57.590
I should mention it for you.

00:22:57.590 --> 00:23:02.580
As soon as you're looking at a
fading channel, the power that

00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:05.380
you're talking about becomes
a little peculiar.

00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:07.030
Because remember when
we were looking

00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:09.020
at white noise channels?

00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:12.600
What we were looking at is the
power at the receiver, the

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:16.650
signal power as received
at the receiver.

00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:19.890
Now at this point, we still want
to talk about E sub b.

00:23:19.890 --> 00:23:23.320
We still want to isolate this
problem from the attenuation

00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:26.590
that occurs just because of
distance and things like.

00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:31.680
Because of that, when we model
g, this original model that we

00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:39.220
use here was a model in
which the magnitude

00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:41.840
of g had mean one.

00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:44.500
And we made it have mean
one so that the energy

00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:45.560
would come out right.

00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:48.470
Which is another reason why you
get confused with these E

00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:50.940
sub b over N sub 0 terms.

00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:57.720
OK so anyway, that's
the answer.

00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:03.760
And E sub b is in terms of the
received energy using the

00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:06.360
average value of fading.

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:09.800
OK we next want to look at
non-coherent detection.

00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:12.270
Non-coherent detection
is another thing that

00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:15.370
communication engineers
use all the time, talk

00:24:15.370 --> 00:24:16.760
about all the time.

00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:20.670
And you have to understand what
the difference is between

00:24:20.670 --> 00:24:24.060
coherent transmission and
incoherent transmission.

00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:27.850
The general idea is that when
you're doing incoherent

00:24:27.850 --> 00:24:30.590
detection, you're assuming that
you don't know what the

00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:32.590
phase of the channel is.

00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:35.960
And somehow you want to do your
detection without knowing

00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:37.520
that phase.

00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:39.870
The difference between Rayleigh
fading on this kind

00:24:39.870 --> 00:24:43.990
of channel and incoherent
detection, is that with

00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:48.140
incoherent detection the
receiver is assumed to know

00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:52.200
what the magnitude of the
channel is, but not the phase.

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:55.640
It's harder to measure the phase
of the channel than it

00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:57.060
is the measure of
the magnitude.

00:24:57.060 --> 00:25:01.010
Because the phase changes
very, very fast.

00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:03.810
If you look at these equations
we have for what the response

00:25:03.810 --> 00:25:08.610
of the channel is, you see the
phase changing many, many

00:25:08.610 --> 00:25:13.240
times during the time where the
amplitude of the fading

00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:15.560
changes by just a little bit.

00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:20.100
So a very common assumption that
people make when trying

00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:23.910
to do detection is that
it's incoherent.

00:25:23.910 --> 00:25:27.250
Partly, people get used to
analyzing incoherent

00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:29.480
communication.

00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:31.450
And I've seen this
so many times.

00:25:31.450 --> 00:25:34.740
And they insist on building
communication systems using

00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:36.360
incoherent detection.

00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:38.300
They will swear up and down
there's no way you

00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:39.740
can measure the phase.

00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:42.840
And what they're really saying
is that's the only kind of

00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:45.250
communication they understand.

00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:48.090
And because that's the only
thing they understand, they

00:25:48.090 --> 00:25:51.260
become very, very upset if
anyone suggests that you ought

00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:53.050
to try to measure the phase.

00:25:53.050 --> 00:25:56.830
But that's a tale
for another day.

00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:04.050
OK so now we want to look at the
case where we're assuming

00:26:04.050 --> 00:26:07.560
that we know the magnitude
of the channel.

00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:11.570
It's just some quantity that
we'll call g tilde.

00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:16.390
We're assuming that the same
magnitude occurs both on U sub

00:26:16.390 --> 00:26:17.810
0 and U sub 1.

00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:20.430
We're going to use the same
transmission system that we

00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:24.190
used before, namely
pulse-position modulation.

00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:28.340
We'll either put our energy in
U sub 0 or we'll put our

00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:29.750
energy in U sub 1.

00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:31.830
We'll try to detect
what's going on.

00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:34.770
But we just give the detector
this little extra amount of

00:26:34.770 --> 00:26:37.920
ability of knowing what
the channel is.

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:42.050
I'm going to talk more later
about how you can use this

00:26:42.050 --> 00:26:45.190
knowledge of what the channel
is, and how you can measure

00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:46.050
what the channel is.

00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:48.710
But for now we just assume
that we know it.

00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:51.450
So the phase is random
and independent

00:26:51.450 --> 00:26:53.050
of everything else.

00:26:53.050 --> 00:27:00.400
So under hypothesis H equals
zero, we have the output of

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:01.060
the channel.

00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:07.690
And times 0 is whatever input
level we put in a, times what

00:27:07.690 --> 00:27:12.190
the channel does to us, times
e to this random phase.

00:27:12.190 --> 00:27:13.760
And V sub 1 it's just--

00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:23.320
plus Z sub 0.

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:28.050
And in the other case we have
V sub 1 equals Z sub 1.

00:27:28.050 --> 00:27:32.355
And under the other hypothesis
V sub 1 is this input with a

00:27:32.355 --> 00:27:37.820
random phase but a known
magnitude and again, a

00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:39.040
Gaussian random variable.

00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:42.250
Phases are independent
of the hypothesis.

00:27:42.250 --> 00:27:44.000
The phases are independent
of the

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.660
magnitudes which are known.

00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:48.470
The phases are independent of
everything and therefore, we

00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:51.130
just want to forget
about them.

00:27:51.130 --> 00:27:54.350
So the question is, how do we
make a maximum likelihood

00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:57.510
decision on this problem?

00:27:57.510 --> 00:27:59.080
Well you look at the problem.

00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:03.510
And for the same reason as
before you say, it's obvious

00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:06.070
how to make a maximum likelihood
decision just from

00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:09.450
all the symmetry
that you have.

00:28:09.450 --> 00:28:12.770
If the magnitude of V sub 0 is
bigger than the magnitude of V

00:28:12.770 --> 00:28:16.000
sub 1, V sub 0 corresponds to
this little bit of extra

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.960
energy that you have.

00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:22.010
So if V sub 0, the magnitude
of V sub 0 is positive, is

00:28:22.010 --> 00:28:24.790
bigger than the magnitude
of V sub 1, you want to

00:28:24.790 --> 00:28:26.960
choose H equals 0.

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:30.740
And alternatively you'll want
to choose H equals 1.

00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:33.250
It's obvious right?

00:28:33.250 --> 00:28:37.040
I've tried for years to find
a way to prove that.

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:40.280
And the only way I can prove
it is by going into Bessel

00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:43.340
functions which is the way that
everybody else proves it.

00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:46.040
And this seems like absolute
foolishness to me.

00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:48.930
And if any of you can find a
way to do this, I would be

00:28:48.930 --> 00:28:51.000
delighted to hear it.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.120
I will be in great admiration
of you.

00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:57.020
Because I'm sure there has
to be an easy way to

00:28:57.020 --> 00:28:58.430
look at this problem.

00:28:58.430 --> 00:29:00.860
And I just can't find it.

00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:03.440
OK anyway, we're not going to
worry about all these Bessel

00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:08.670
functions, because that's just
arithmetic in a sense.

00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:12.040
So we're just going to say well
it can be proven using

00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:13.380
all of this machinery.

00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:16.610
So what we really want to find
is what is the probability of

00:29:16.610 --> 00:29:19.420
error when we make
that decision.

00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:23.180
And when we make that decision,
namely what we're

00:29:23.180 --> 00:29:26.740
looking for is the probability
of this magnitude then, is

00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:34.370
bigger than this magnitude
when H equals one is the

00:29:34.370 --> 00:29:35.420
correct hypothesis.

00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:38.440
Because that's the probability
of error then.

00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:40.130
So you have these two
different terms.

00:29:40.130 --> 00:29:43.230
You just go through all of the
junk that's in the appendix to

00:29:43.230 --> 00:29:46.080
the notes we passed
out last time.

00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:48.080
If you want to go through that,
I think it's great.

00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:50.510
It's an interesting analysis.

00:29:50.510 --> 00:29:52.510
Certainly not going
to do it now.

00:29:52.510 --> 00:29:55.490
When you get done doing that you
find out the probability

00:29:55.490 --> 00:30:00.540
of error is exactly one half
times e to the minus a-squared

00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:04.250
times this known magnitude
of the channel.

00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:08.670
I mean, a-squared and g tilde
have to appear together here.

00:30:08.670 --> 00:30:11.860
OK because what's coming out of
the channel, the magnitude

00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:15.370
of what's coming out of the
channel without noise is just

00:30:15.370 --> 00:30:17.510
a times g tilde.

00:30:17.510 --> 00:30:19.810
They both come together
everywhere.

00:30:19.810 --> 00:30:24.560
And therefore, they have to come
together anytime you're

00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:27.860
talking about optimal detection,
probability of

00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:29.700
error, or anything else.

00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:31.030
So these two appear together.

00:30:31.030 --> 00:30:34.350
We have the same noise term down
here as we had before.

00:30:34.350 --> 00:30:37.650
Because again we're using a
sampling theorem analysis and

00:30:37.650 --> 00:30:42.510
the noise in each of these
random variables is W N sub 0.

00:30:42.510 --> 00:30:44.630
OK so that's a little surprising
that that's what

00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:47.270
the noise is.

00:30:47.270 --> 00:30:52.130
If you knew the phase also, if
the detector knew both the

00:30:52.130 --> 00:30:55.200
magnitude and the phase of the
channel, it would be the

00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:57.520
conventional Gaussian
problem that we've

00:30:57.520 --> 00:31:00.000
analyzed many times before.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:04.770
And the solution would be that
probability of error is equal

00:31:04.770 --> 00:31:08.420
to Q of a-squared times
g tilde squared

00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:11.750
divided by W N sub 0.

00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:13.890
Now if you remember the
estimates we've come up with

00:31:13.890 --> 00:31:17.350
and the bounds we've come up
with on the Q function, the

00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:21.940
simplest bound that we came
up with was this.

00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:25.490
Namely you take this thing, you
take one half of it, which

00:31:25.490 --> 00:31:28.070
is the Gaussian density
with the coefficient.

00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:29.970
You multiply it by one half.

00:31:29.970 --> 00:31:33.740
So this is the simplest estimate
we can get of this.

00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:37.280
On the other hand when this
quantity is large, a much

00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:40.930
better estimate of this is to
have that estimate which has a

00:31:40.930 --> 00:31:47.030
1 over the square root of pi
times W N sub 0 over a-squared

00:31:47.030 --> 00:31:48.560
g tilde squared in it.

00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:50.600
So we have that term extra.

00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:53.520
Which says that when this
is large, whenever we're

00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:57.430
communicating at all reasonably,
this probability

00:31:57.430 --> 00:32:03.230
of error is much smaller than
this probability of error.

00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:06.345
However you talk to any
communication engineer, and

00:32:06.345 --> 00:32:09.090
they'll say when you have a
good signal noise ratio,

00:32:09.090 --> 00:32:11.130
incoherent detection
is virtually as

00:32:11.130 --> 00:32:14.300
good as coherent detection.

00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:15.550
And why did they say that?

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:22.920
Well it's because the
probability of error goes down

00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:24.860
so quickly with energy here.

00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:27.330
It's going down as a square
of an exponent.

00:32:27.330 --> 00:32:31.590
Well it's going down as an
exponent in the energy.

00:32:31.590 --> 00:32:37.160
The question you want to ask is
how much extra energy do I

00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:40.120
have to use?

00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:43.070
If I'm using coherent detection,
how much more

00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:47.520
energy does an incoherent
detector need at the input in

00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:49.930
order to get the same results?

00:32:49.930 --> 00:32:52.300
And then you see the question
is very different.

00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:55.580
Because if I increase this
quantity just a little bit,

00:32:55.580 --> 00:33:00.230
this probability of error
goes down like a bat.

00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:01.590
OK.

00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:05.100
So what happens then, when you
compare these two terms is

00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:09.220
that as the signal to noise
ratio gets larger and larger,

00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:12.100
the amount of extra energy you
need to make incoherent

00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:16.470
detection work as well as
coherent detection goes down

00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:17.720
with 1 over a-squared.

00:33:21.250 --> 00:33:26.280
Which says that these
communication engineers who

00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:30.770
swear that they like incoherent
detection in fact,

00:33:30.770 --> 00:33:33.500
have something on their side.

00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:35.380
because they don't
have to assume so

00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:36.830
much about the channel.

00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:39.620
They have something which
is more robust.

00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:43.560
And in fact what's turning out
here, is that even though this

00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:47.140
error probability is a little
bigger than this error

00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:50.640
probability, there's only a
very negligible amount of

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:54.270
extra dB required to make
the two the same.

00:33:54.270 --> 00:33:57.320
So it only costs a little bit of
extra energy to be able to

00:33:57.320 --> 00:34:01.710
use incoherent detection instead
of coherent detection.

00:34:01.710 --> 00:34:04.640
OK so this is very
strange now.

00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:07.810
We have a nice error probability
which is almost as

00:34:07.810 --> 00:34:11.140
good as the Gaussian
error probability

00:34:11.140 --> 00:34:13.890
using incoherent detection.

00:34:13.890 --> 00:34:18.110
This is assuming that the
channel, that the receiver

00:34:18.110 --> 00:34:22.440
knows what g tilde is.

00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:25.450
But now we go back and think
about this, and look at our

00:34:25.450 --> 00:34:29.340
detection rule, which is the
optimal detection rule.

00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:32.950
And the optimal detection rule
is no matter what g tilde

00:34:32.950 --> 00:34:36.700
happens to be, we compare the
magnitude of V sub 0 with the

00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:39.640
magnitude of V sub 1.

00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:42.020
In other words, we have analyzed
this assuming that we

00:34:42.020 --> 00:34:43.350
know what g tilde is.

00:34:43.350 --> 00:34:45.660
We know what the gain
of the channel is.

00:34:45.660 --> 00:34:47.900
But the receiver doesn't pay
any attention to it.

00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:56.590
OK so now we have this very
peculiar situation where

00:34:56.590 --> 00:35:01.910
incoherent detection with a
known value channel is almost

00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:06.150
as good as coherent
detection is.

00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:10.180
But at the same time Rayleigh
fading gives this awful error

00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:12.800
probability.

00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:16.580
So now you have the final part
of the argument take this

00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:22.270
probability of error, multiply
it by the probability density

00:35:22.270 --> 00:35:27.690
of g tilde squared, integrate
it to find out what the

00:35:27.690 --> 00:35:31.090
average error probability is
when we average over the

00:35:31.090 --> 00:35:32.900
channel fading.

00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:34.340
And guess what answer you get?

00:35:37.830 --> 00:35:39.690
Well you ought to be able to
guess it if you've looked at

00:35:39.690 --> 00:35:41.050
the homework already.

00:35:41.050 --> 00:35:43.190
Because in the homework you
actually go through this

00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:44.260
integration.

00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:47.170
And bingo you get the Rayleigh
fading result.

00:35:47.170 --> 00:35:50.510
Which says that the problem with
Rayleigh fading is not

00:35:50.510 --> 00:35:52.960
any lack of knowledge
about the channel.

00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:57.580
Knowing what the channel is
would not give you, even

00:35:57.580 --> 00:36:00.010
knowing what the phase is of the
channel would not give you

00:36:00.010 --> 00:36:01.020
a lot of extra help.

00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:03.790
The only help in knowing what
the phase is, is to get this

00:36:03.790 --> 00:36:05.680
result instead of this result.

00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:07.870
And even that won't
help you much.

00:36:07.870 --> 00:36:13.070
The problem is anytime you're
dealing with Rayleigh fading,

00:36:13.070 --> 00:36:17.170
the channel has faded so badly
a large fraction of the time,

00:36:17.170 --> 00:36:19.110
that you can't get
an acceptable

00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:22.030
probability of error.

00:36:22.030 --> 00:36:23.730
OK so now we have to
stop and think.

00:36:23.730 --> 00:36:25.080
What do you do about this?

00:36:34.190 --> 00:36:37.910
Well you have two general kinds
of techniques to use at

00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:39.270
this point.

00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:42.330
OK and one of them is to
try to measure the

00:36:42.330 --> 00:36:45.490
channel at the receiver.

00:36:45.490 --> 00:36:48.320
You take the measurement of the
channel at the receiver.

00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:50.530
You send it to the
transmitter.

00:36:50.530 --> 00:36:54.810
And the transmitter then does
something to compensate for

00:36:54.810 --> 00:36:56.510
the amount of fading.

00:36:56.510 --> 00:37:00.210
One thing that the transmitter
can do is anytime the channel

00:37:00.210 --> 00:37:03.080
is badly faded, it increases
the amount of

00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:05.620
power that it's sending.

00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:09.220
That's what typical
voice systems do.

00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:11.700
And the other thing that you can
do is change the rate at

00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:13.830
which you're transmitting.

00:37:13.830 --> 00:37:16.700
You can do all sorts of things
with the transmitter if you

00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:18.180
know what the channel is.

00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:21.300
You can respond to it
in various ways.

00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:24.310
And all these different
communication systems have

00:37:24.310 --> 00:37:28.250
various ways of dealing
with that.

00:37:28.250 --> 00:37:31.780
And we'll talk a little about
that on Wednesday when we talk

00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:33.030
about CDMA.

00:37:35.450 --> 00:37:38.270
The other thing you can do
about it is use something

00:37:38.270 --> 00:37:40.050
called diversity.

00:37:40.050 --> 00:37:46.270
And the idea of diversity is
that instead of sending this

00:37:46.270 --> 00:37:49.580
one bit, trying to use as few
degrees of freedom as

00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:54.610
possible, you try to send your
bits using as many degrees of

00:37:54.610 --> 00:37:56.320
freedom as possible.

00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:59.560
If you can use a large number of
degrees of freedom, and if

00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:02.280
the fading is independent on
these different degrees of

00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:05.790
freedom, then in fact
you gain something.

00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:09.490
Because instead of having one
random variable which can

00:38:09.490 --> 00:38:14.350
totally cripple you, you have
lots of random variables.

00:38:14.350 --> 00:38:16.670
And if any one of them is
good, you get through.

00:38:16.670 --> 00:38:20.960
So you get a benefit
out of diversity.

00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:23.510
OK so that's our next topic.

00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:29.860
Namely, how do you measure
the channel?

00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:33.000
Because if you're going to use
diversity it's a help to know

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.010
the channel.

00:38:34.010 --> 00:38:37.080
If you're going to use coding,
coding is just another way to

00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:39.290
get diversity.

00:38:39.290 --> 00:38:42.180
Again your coding will work
better if you know what the

00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:43.950
channel is.

00:38:43.950 --> 00:38:48.590
So somehow we would like to be
able to measure the channel

00:38:48.590 --> 00:38:51.480
and send it back to the
transmitter if we want to

00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:55.830
alter the power, the rate of
the transmitter, and to let

00:38:55.830 --> 00:39:01.780
the receiver use it if the
receiver is going to.

00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:06.430
Well we have seen that when
you use one bit on just a

00:39:06.430 --> 00:39:10.060
couple of degrees of freedom,
knowing what the channel is

00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:11.780
does not do you much help.

00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:15.890
If you use coding or if you use
one bit and spread it over

00:39:15.890 --> 00:39:18.920
a large number of degrees of
freedom, then knowing what the

00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:21.740
channel is gives you
a great deal.

00:39:21.740 --> 00:39:25.240
This is one of the basic
confusions that everyone has

00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:27.170
when they deal with
Rayleigh fading.

00:39:27.170 --> 00:39:29.400
Because when you look at a
Rayleigh faded channel, the

00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:32.580
first thing you analyze is this
incredibly small number

00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:34.160
of degrees of freedom.

00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:35.770
And you say wow, that's awful.

00:39:35.770 --> 00:39:39.880
There's no way to
deal with that.

00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:42.500
And then you start looking
for something.

00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:45.510
And you say, well diversity
helps me.

00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:48.140
But in general, this is the
general scheme of things that

00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:50.110
we're going to use.

00:39:50.110 --> 00:39:51.020
OK.

00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:54.600
So as we said channel
measurement helps if diversity

00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:55.820
is available.

00:39:55.820 --> 00:39:58.940
Why does that help when
diversity is available?

00:39:58.940 --> 00:40:02.790
OK, think of sending
this one bit.

00:40:02.790 --> 00:40:06.000
You get one reception, and then

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.970
you get another reception.

00:40:07.970 --> 00:40:11.200
And on this reception, you
get one amount of fading.

00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:15.470
On this reception you get
another amount of fading.

00:40:15.470 --> 00:40:19.350
If I don't know how much fading
there is it doesn't

00:40:19.350 --> 00:40:21.010
help me an awful lot.

00:40:21.010 --> 00:40:22.260
It helps me some.

00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:25.300
But if I know that this channel
is faded badly and

00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:28.320
this channel is not faded, then
I'm going to use what

00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:32.310
comes out here instead of
what comes out here.

00:40:32.310 --> 00:40:35.990
And then my detector is going
to work much, much better.

00:40:35.990 --> 00:40:40.100
When you look at diversity
results, always ask yourself a

00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:42.360
couple of questions.

00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:45.620
Is the detector using knowledge
of what the strength

00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:50.420
of the channel is on these
two diversity outputs?

00:40:50.420 --> 00:40:53.360
Is the transmitter using it's
knowledge of what those

00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:54.430
channels are?

00:40:54.430 --> 00:40:57.640
You get very different results
for diversity depending on the

00:40:57.640 --> 00:41:02.670
answers to both of
those questions.

00:41:02.670 --> 00:41:08.660
OK, so if you have a multi-tap
model for a channel--

00:41:08.660 --> 00:41:13.000
OK remember the multi-tap models
that we came up with.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:18.970
We we're looking at transmission
using multipath.

00:41:18.970 --> 00:41:22.470
And we had multipath in
different ranges of a delay.

00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:29.950
We came up with a model which
gave us multiple taps for a

00:41:29.950 --> 00:41:32.440
discrete model of the channel.

00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:35.560
You get a large number of taps
if you're using broadband

00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:36.430
communication.

00:41:36.430 --> 00:41:40.210
Because using broadband
communication 1 over W becomes

00:41:40.210 --> 00:41:41.250
very small.

00:41:41.250 --> 00:41:45.200
And therefore these ranges of
delay become very small.

00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:48.030
And if you're using very narrow
band communication,

00:41:48.030 --> 00:41:50.180
that's when you have
the flat fading.

00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:54.080
Namely flat fading is not flat
fading, it's fading which is

00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:56.740
flat over the bandwidth
that you're using.

00:41:56.740 --> 00:41:59.370
So if you use a broader
bandwidth and you have

00:41:59.370 --> 00:42:02.580
multiple taps, then these taps
are going to be independent of

00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:03.580
each other.

00:42:03.580 --> 00:42:06.170
And you automatically
have diversity.

00:42:06.170 --> 00:42:08.520
So the question is how
do you use that.

00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:10.300
Well if you're going to use
it, you better be able to

00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:12.270
measure it.

00:42:12.270 --> 00:42:16.310
OK so now we're going to try to
figure out how to do that

00:42:16.310 --> 00:42:17.560
measurement.

00:42:20.170 --> 00:42:24.600
And the first thing to do is
to assume the simplest

00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:26.180
possible thing.

00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:29.610
I mean, suppose you know how
many taps the channel has.

00:42:29.610 --> 00:42:32.850
Suppose it has k sub
0 channel taps.

00:42:32.850 --> 00:42:35.400
So the channel looks like
this, G sub 0, G sub

00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:38.120
1, and G sub 2.

00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:42.170
You're transmitting a
sequence of inputs.

00:42:42.170 --> 00:42:45.960
OK remember all of this stuff
came from trying to model a

00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:49.430
channel in terms of discrete
inputs, where you're sending

00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:52.810
one input each one
over W seconds.

00:42:52.810 --> 00:42:55.270
So you put in a sequence
of inputs.

00:42:55.270 --> 00:42:58.510
You have these three different
channel taps here.

00:42:58.510 --> 00:43:05.920
And what comes out when you put
in a single bit here or a

00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:08.120
single symbol.

00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:11.110
You get something out when
this tap right away.

00:43:11.110 --> 00:43:15.430
You get something out here
one time unit later.

00:43:15.430 --> 00:43:19.720
You get something out here,
one epoch still later.

00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:22.870
So all of these outputs
get added up.

00:43:22.870 --> 00:43:32.290
And therefore the output here
at time m, is the input at

00:43:32.290 --> 00:43:39.160
time m times this tap, plus the
input at time m minus 1

00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:42.800
times this tap, plus the
input at time m minus

00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:44.740
2 times this tap.

00:43:44.740 --> 00:43:48.370
Because it takes these inputs
that long to go through there.

00:43:48.370 --> 00:43:52.360
All this is is just digital
convolution, OK.

00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:54.370
I'm just drawing it out in
the figure so you see

00:43:54.370 --> 00:43:55.090
what's going on.

00:43:55.090 --> 00:43:57.990
Because otherwise you tend to
think everything happens at

00:43:57.990 --> 00:43:59.560
one instant of time.

00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:03.080
Then we're adding this
white Gaussian noise.

00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:05.230
When we're talking about
digital systems, white

00:44:05.230 --> 00:44:08.600
Gaussian noise just means that
each of these random variables

00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:11.050
are independent at each
other random variable.

00:44:11.050 --> 00:44:12.760
They all have the
same variance.

00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:14.900
And the real parts and
imaginary parts

00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:15.960
have the same variance.

00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:17.310
And they're independent
of each other.

00:44:17.310 --> 00:44:20.660
Namely these are all normal
random variables.

00:44:20.660 --> 00:44:27.270
Since we're sending a, or minus
a, or something with

00:44:27.270 --> 00:44:30.960
magnitude a, we want to divide
by a out here, if we want to

00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:34.940
figure out anything about
what these taps are.

00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:39.550
OK so suppose that what we send
now is a bunch of zeros,

00:44:39.550 --> 00:44:43.240
followed by a single input,
followed by a bunch of zeros.

00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:44.730
What comes out?

00:44:44.730 --> 00:44:48.320
Well the thing that comes out is
at the point that this big

00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:57.630
input comes in, we get a
G sub 0 out at the time

00:44:57.630 --> 00:44:58.960
that you put in a.

00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:01.430
I mean we're leaving out
propagation delay here.

00:45:01.430 --> 00:45:04.900
We got a times G sub
1, the next epoch.

00:45:04.900 --> 00:45:08.370
Then we get a times G sub
2, the next epoch.

00:45:08.370 --> 00:45:11.770
And by that time the input is
completely out of the filter.

00:45:11.770 --> 00:45:14.270
And we get zeros after that.

00:45:14.270 --> 00:45:19.410
So if you put in a bunch of
zeros and then a single a, you

00:45:19.410 --> 00:45:21.550
got a nice measurement
of the channel.

00:45:21.550 --> 00:45:25.050
There's Gaussian noise added
to each of these inputs.

00:45:25.050 --> 00:45:28.710
But in fact you do
get a reading of

00:45:28.710 --> 00:45:29.960
each channel output.

00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:34.980
When you divide these by the a
here, then you get something

00:45:34.980 --> 00:45:42.410
which is a measurement of the
appropriate tap G plus

00:45:42.410 --> 00:45:44.690
Gaussian noise on it.

00:45:44.690 --> 00:45:47.930
OK now you try to make an
estimation from this.

00:45:47.930 --> 00:45:50.040
And the trouble is we don't
want to say much about

00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:52.020
estimation theory.

00:45:52.020 --> 00:45:55.430
But in fact the notes gives you
a very brief introduction

00:45:55.430 --> 00:45:57.690
into estimation.

00:45:57.690 --> 00:46:00.080
There are two well-known
kinds of estimation.

00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:03.550
One of them is maximum
likelihood estimation.

00:46:03.550 --> 00:46:07.530
And the other one is minimum
mean square error estimation.

00:46:07.530 --> 00:46:11.510
Maximum likelihood estimation is
in fact exactly the same as

00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:13.630
maximum likelihood detection.

00:46:13.630 --> 00:46:16.000
Namely you look at the
likelihoods which is the

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:21.910
probabilities of the outputs
given the inputs.

00:46:21.910 --> 00:46:23.630
And what's the input
in this problem?

00:46:27.430 --> 00:46:30.140
The input is these channel
variables.

00:46:30.140 --> 00:46:33.840
Because that's the thing we're
trying to measure in this

00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:34.860
measurement problem.

00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:37.310
We assume that the probing
signal is known.

00:46:37.310 --> 00:46:40.035
It's just a bunch of zeros,
followed by a, followed by a

00:46:40.035 --> 00:46:41.100
bunch of zeros.

00:46:41.100 --> 00:46:42.220
So we know that.

00:46:42.220 --> 00:46:45.070
We're trying to estimate
these things.

00:46:45.070 --> 00:46:48.020
So these are the variables that
we're trying to estimate.

00:46:48.020 --> 00:46:50.880
So we try to find the
probability density of the

00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:54.810
output conditional on the
knowledge of G sub 0.

00:46:54.810 --> 00:46:58.560
Which is just the Gaussian
density shifted to

00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:00.380
a times G sub 0.

00:47:04.130 --> 00:47:11.580
You then look at the maximum
likelihood estimate of G. So

00:47:11.580 --> 00:47:17.120
you're looking at the value
you can put in to maximize

00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:25.560
this estimate which comes out
here as a times G sub 2.

00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:29.020
And then at this appropriate
time, you're looking at G sub

00:47:29.020 --> 00:47:32.690
2 here, plus a noise
random variable.

00:47:32.690 --> 00:47:36.160
And since the noise is zero
mean, this quantity here is in

00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:39.570
fact the best estimate in
terms of the maximum

00:47:39.570 --> 00:47:41.260
likelihood that you can get.

00:47:41.260 --> 00:47:44.395
If you assume that this is a
Gaussian random variable and

00:47:44.395 --> 00:47:47.520
this is a Gaussian random
variable, you can solve a

00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:50.310
minimum mean square error
estimation problem.

00:47:50.310 --> 00:47:55.210
It's much like the map problem
except these random variables

00:47:55.210 --> 00:47:57.770
are all continuous here.

00:47:57.770 --> 00:48:01.250
But it's a little different from
the map problem in the

00:48:01.250 --> 00:48:05.400
sense that you can't have
equally likely inputs where

00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:07.570
you have a continuous
random variable.

00:48:07.570 --> 00:48:09.700
You make them all equally
probable.

00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:11.990
The only possible value
you can have is zero.

00:48:11.990 --> 00:48:13.840
Because it has to
extend forever.

00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:19.040
So anyway, maximum likelihood
detection is just normalize

00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:22.820
what you get so that in the
absence of Gaussian noise, you

00:48:22.820 --> 00:48:25.120
would get the variable
you're looking for.

00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:26.720
And then ignore the
Gaussian noise,

00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:28.470
and that's your estimate.

00:48:28.470 --> 00:48:29.050
OK.

00:48:29.050 --> 00:48:32.630
If you want to do this and you
want to use the strategy, it

00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:34.860
looks like a very
nice strategy.

00:48:34.860 --> 00:48:38.350
But what's the problem in it?

00:48:38.350 --> 00:48:41.940
If this sequence is somewhat
longer, you need a whole lot

00:48:41.940 --> 00:48:45.200
of zeros in between each
probing signal.

00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:48.590
And what that means is you're
going to be using your energy

00:48:48.590 --> 00:48:52.550
and clumping it all up
into the small number

00:48:52.550 --> 00:48:53.920
of degrees of freedom.

00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:57.590
Which means you're going to be
sending a lot of energy at one

00:48:57.590 --> 00:48:59.990
instant of time and then nothing
for a long period of

00:48:59.990 --> 00:49:03.100
time, then a very big signal for
awhile then nothing for a

00:49:03.100 --> 00:49:06.630
long period of time,
and so forth.

00:49:06.630 --> 00:49:11.010
If you do that, the FTC
is really going

00:49:11.010 --> 00:49:12.610
to be down on you.

00:49:12.610 --> 00:49:15.970
Because you're not supposed to
send too much energy in any

00:49:15.970 --> 00:49:19.570
small amount of time or any
small amount of frequency.

00:49:19.570 --> 00:49:21.950
So you're supposed to spread
things out a little bit.

00:49:21.950 --> 00:49:24.470
You say OK, that doesn't
work too well.

00:49:24.470 --> 00:49:25.960
What am I going to do?

00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:30.100
How can I choose a sequence of
input so they have relatively

00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:34.850
constant amplitude, but at the
same time so that when I go

00:49:34.850 --> 00:49:38.700
through this kind of filter, I
can sort out what's coming

00:49:38.700 --> 00:49:41.290
from here, and what's coming
from here, and

00:49:41.290 --> 00:49:43.480
what's coming from here.

00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:46.020
Well it turns out that the
answer to that question is to

00:49:46.020 --> 00:49:48.880
use a pseudonoise sequence.

00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:52.540
And the next thing I want to
do is to give you some idea

00:49:52.540 --> 00:49:55.530
about why these pseudonoise
sequences work.

00:49:58.310 --> 00:50:00.410
OK so we'll think in terms
of vectors now.

00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:09.240
OK so we have a vector input, u
sub 1, u sub 2, up to u sub

00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:11.210
n, a vector of length n.

00:50:11.210 --> 00:50:15.670
So we're putting these
discrete signals in

00:50:15.670 --> 00:50:17.610
one after the other.

00:50:17.610 --> 00:50:19.960
We're passing them through
this, which is a digital

00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:21.140
filter now.

00:50:21.140 --> 00:50:26.350
So what comes out here V prime
is just a convolution of u and

00:50:26.350 --> 00:50:30.370
G. We then add the
noise to it.

00:50:30.370 --> 00:50:32.670
I claim that what we ought
to do is use the matched

00:50:32.670 --> 00:50:35.140
filter here to u.

00:50:35.140 --> 00:50:39.950
And if I use a matched filter
to u here, that matched

00:50:39.950 --> 00:50:43.830
filter, if I'm using a
pseudonoise sequence, is going

00:50:43.830 --> 00:50:48.820
to bingo give me the filter that
I started out with, plus

00:50:48.820 --> 00:50:49.910
some noise.

00:50:49.910 --> 00:50:51.780
OK why is that?

00:50:51.780 --> 00:50:55.480
The property that pseudonoise
sequences have, if I choose

00:50:55.480 --> 00:51:01.070
each of the inputs to have the
magnitude of a, and think of

00:51:01.070 --> 00:51:04.150
it as being real plus or minus
a, which is what people

00:51:04.150 --> 00:51:05.620
usually do.

00:51:05.620 --> 00:51:09.090
If you look at the correlation
of this sequence, namely the

00:51:09.090 --> 00:51:14.560
correlation of u sub m with the
complex conjugate of u sub

00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:20.540
m spaced a little bit, PN
sequences have the property

00:51:20.540 --> 00:51:24.720
that this correlation function
looks like an impulse.

00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:25.610
OK.

00:51:25.610 --> 00:51:29.290
Now how you find sequences that
have that property is

00:51:29.290 --> 00:51:31.060
another question.

00:51:31.060 --> 00:51:32.630
But in fact they do exist.

00:51:32.630 --> 00:51:34.020
There are lots of them.

00:51:34.020 --> 00:51:35.570
They're easy to find.

00:51:38.730 --> 00:51:41.910
And they have this very
nice property.

00:51:41.910 --> 00:51:46.550
Another way to say this is that
is that the vector u has

00:51:46.550 --> 00:51:49.260
to be orthogonal to
all of its shifts.

00:51:49.260 --> 00:51:51.800
That's exactly what
this is saying.

00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:55.850
And another way of saying it
is that u, if you pass it

00:51:55.850 --> 00:51:58.440
through the matched filter to
u-- now remember what a

00:51:58.440 --> 00:52:02.440
matched filter is on
an analog waveform.

00:52:02.440 --> 00:52:06.850
You take a waveform, you switch
it around in time.

00:52:06.850 --> 00:52:09.200
You take the complex conjugate
of it, and

00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:10.900
that's the matched filter.

00:52:10.900 --> 00:52:14.200
And when you convolve u with
this matched filter, what it's

00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:18.490
doing is just exactly the same
operation of correlation.

00:52:18.490 --> 00:52:22.110
OK in other words, convolution
with one of the sequences

00:52:22.110 --> 00:52:26.380
turned around this time, is
the same as correlation.

00:52:26.380 --> 00:52:29.460
And most of you have
seen that I'm sure.

00:52:29.460 --> 00:52:34.070
So that if we take this matched
filter where u tilde

00:52:34.070 --> 00:52:38.180
sub j is equal to the complex
conjugate of u at time minus

00:52:38.180 --> 00:52:43.940
j, then I pass u through the
filter G. Forget about the

00:52:43.940 --> 00:52:45.480
noise for the time being.

00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:49.900
I then pass it through the
matched filter u tilde.

00:52:49.900 --> 00:52:53.870
What I'm going to get out, I
claim, is G. And I'll show you

00:52:53.870 --> 00:52:56.270
why that is in just a minute.

00:52:56.270 --> 00:52:59.120
Let make caution you
about something.

00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:01.970
Because you can get very
confused with this picture.

00:53:01.970 --> 00:53:07.180
Because as soon as I take this
input, u 1 up to u sub m.

00:53:07.180 --> 00:53:11.610
This matched filter is going to
start responding at time u

00:53:11.610 --> 00:53:12.740
sub minus m.

00:53:12.740 --> 00:53:14.650
And it's going to finish
responding a

00:53:14.650 --> 00:53:16.750
time u sub minus 1.

00:53:16.750 --> 00:53:19.580
So it responds before
it's hit.

00:53:19.580 --> 00:53:23.310
Which again is this business of
thinking of timing at the

00:53:23.310 --> 00:53:27.030
receiver being very much delayed
from timing at the

00:53:27.030 --> 00:53:29.020
transmitter.

00:53:29.020 --> 00:53:30.920
Which is a trick that
we've always played.

00:53:30.920 --> 00:53:33.710
Which is why we don't have to
think of filters as being

00:53:33.710 --> 00:53:34.880
realizable.

00:53:34.880 --> 00:53:37.820
Still in this example, this
becomes confusing.

00:53:37.820 --> 00:53:39.070
And I'll show you
why in a minute.

00:53:44.280 --> 00:53:49.100
OK so I'm going to assume that
I picked a good PN sequence.

00:53:49.100 --> 00:53:53.150
So when I convolve it with its
matched filter I essentially

00:53:53.150 --> 00:53:58.170
get an impulse function, namely
a discrete impulse.

00:53:58.170 --> 00:54:02.130
Which is the same as saying that
u is orthogonal to all of

00:54:02.130 --> 00:54:03.370
its shifts.

00:54:03.370 --> 00:54:04.900
And that's exactly what
you what to do.

00:54:04.900 --> 00:54:06.320
You want to think of
turning it around

00:54:06.320 --> 00:54:07.490
and passing it through.

00:54:07.490 --> 00:54:10.660
And that's exactly what
this is doing.

00:54:10.660 --> 00:54:16.880
OK so we have the output of
this filter, which is u

00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:21.660
convolved with G. We're then
convolving that with this

00:54:21.660 --> 00:54:24.170
matched filter u tilde.

00:54:24.170 --> 00:54:29.860
And now we use the nice property
of convolution, which

00:54:29.860 --> 00:54:32.630
you probably don't think
of very often.

00:54:32.630 --> 00:54:38.860
But the nice property that
convolution has, is that it's

00:54:38.860 --> 00:54:41.670
both associative and
commutative.

00:54:41.670 --> 00:54:42.180
OK.

00:54:42.180 --> 00:54:47.010
And therefore when we look at
V prime times u tilde, it's

00:54:47.010 --> 00:54:51.510
the convolution of u with G--
that's what the prime is-- all

00:54:51.510 --> 00:54:54.450
convolved with the
matched filter u.

00:54:54.450 --> 00:54:57.600
Because of the associativity and
the commutativity, you can

00:54:57.600 --> 00:55:00.760
reverse these two things so
you're taking the convolution

00:55:00.760 --> 00:55:03.080
of u with its matched filter.

00:55:03.080 --> 00:55:05.870
When you take the convolution of
u with its matched filter,

00:55:05.870 --> 00:55:07.900
you get a delta function.

00:55:07.900 --> 00:55:11.350
And you take a delta function
and pass it through G. And

00:55:11.350 --> 00:55:15.570
what comes out is a delta
function weighted by a-squared

00:55:15.570 --> 00:55:19.240
n, which is just the energy
of what we're putting in.

00:55:19.240 --> 00:55:23.050
OK so that says that if we can
find pseudonoise sequences,

00:55:23.050 --> 00:55:23.940
all of this works.

00:55:23.940 --> 00:55:26.400
And it works just dandy.

00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:29.340
If you put noise in,
what happens there?

00:55:29.340 --> 00:55:31.860
Well let's analyze the
noise separately.

00:55:31.860 --> 00:55:35.890
The noise is going through
this matched filter.

00:55:35.890 --> 00:55:41.030
Well if u is a pseudonoise
sequence, if it has this nice

00:55:41.030 --> 00:55:45.300
correlation property and you
flip it around in time, it's

00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:48.190
going to have the same nice
correlation property.

00:55:48.190 --> 00:55:57.020
So that in fact u tilde is
going to have the same

00:55:57.020 --> 00:56:01.240
property that it's orthogonal
to all of its time shifts.

00:56:01.240 --> 00:56:05.490
If you now look at what happens
when you take Z and

00:56:05.490 --> 00:56:10.290
send it through this filter,
and you find the covariance

00:56:10.290 --> 00:56:14.270
matrix for Z passed through
this filter, what that

00:56:14.270 --> 00:56:18.760
independence gives you is the
correlation function is just

00:56:18.760 --> 00:56:22.510
all diagonal, all terms,
all the same.

00:56:22.510 --> 00:56:27.770
Which says that all of these
terms and this vector here are

00:56:27.770 --> 00:56:29.770
all white Gaussian
noise variables.

00:56:29.770 --> 00:56:34.210
So what comes out is the filter
plus white noise.

00:56:34.210 --> 00:56:36.710
Which is the same thing that
happened when we put in a

00:56:36.710 --> 00:56:40.320
single input with zeros
on both sides.

00:56:40.320 --> 00:56:42.500
OK.

00:56:42.500 --> 00:56:47.910
So using a PN sequence works
in exactly the same way as

00:56:47.910 --> 00:56:51.380
this very special pseudonoise
sequence, which just has one

00:56:51.380 --> 00:56:52.200
input in it.

00:56:52.200 --> 00:56:54.960
Which happens to be a
pseudonoise sequence

00:56:54.960 --> 00:56:57.460
in this term also.

00:56:57.460 --> 00:57:00.300
OK so the output then, is
going to be a maximum

00:57:00.300 --> 00:57:04.000
likelihood estimate of G. OK,
this is the way that people

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:06.420
typically measure channels.

00:57:06.420 --> 00:57:08.970
They use pseudonoise inputs.

00:57:08.970 --> 00:57:11.890
And the output that comes
out, namely the

00:57:11.890 --> 00:57:14.360
output that comes out.

00:57:14.360 --> 00:57:18.510
When we put in a finite duration
pseudonoise sequence,

00:57:18.510 --> 00:57:22.860
what we're going to look for
is the output at the exact

00:57:22.860 --> 00:57:26.580
instant of the last digit
as the input goes in.

00:57:26.580 --> 00:57:30.060
And the output then is G sub
0, followed by G sub 1,

00:57:30.060 --> 00:57:33.600
followed by G sub 2,
and then silence.

00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:36.580
So you see nothing coming out
until this big burst of

00:57:36.580 --> 00:57:44.760
energy, which is all
digits of G.

00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:47.970
OK so now we want to put all
of this together into

00:57:47.970 --> 00:57:50.070
something called a
rake receiver.

00:57:50.070 --> 00:57:52.820
I wish I could spend more time
on the rake receiver because

00:57:52.820 --> 00:57:55.110
it's a really neat thing.

00:57:55.110 --> 00:57:59.630
It was developed in the 50s
about the same time that

00:57:59.630 --> 00:58:01.570
information theory was
getting developed.

00:58:01.570 --> 00:58:06.770
But it was developed by people
who were trying to do radar.

00:58:06.770 --> 00:58:09.110
And at the same time trying to
do a little communication

00:58:09.110 --> 00:58:11.230
along with the radar.

00:58:11.230 --> 00:58:14.170
And this was one of the things
they came up with.

00:58:14.170 --> 00:58:19.000
So they wanted to measure the
channel and make decisions in

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:21.870
transmitting data both
at the same time.

00:58:21.870 --> 00:58:26.340
And the trick here is about the
same as the trick we use

00:58:26.340 --> 00:58:30.700
in trying to measure carrier
frequency, and make decisions

00:58:30.700 --> 00:58:31.930
at the same time.

00:58:31.930 --> 00:58:34.480
Namely you use the decisions
you make

00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:36.000
to measure the frequency.

00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:38.190
You use the frequency
that you've measured

00:58:38.190 --> 00:58:40.670
to make future decisions.

00:58:40.670 --> 00:58:43.510
And here, we're going to do
exactly the same thing.

00:58:43.510 --> 00:58:44.770
We make decisions.

00:58:44.770 --> 00:58:48.680
We use those decisions as a way
of measuring the channel.

00:58:48.680 --> 00:58:51.830
We then use the measurements of
the channel to create this

00:58:51.830 --> 00:58:55.210
matched filter G tilde.

00:58:55.210 --> 00:58:58.940
And that's what we're going to
use to make the decisions.

00:58:58.940 --> 00:59:03.860
OK if you have two different
inputs, I mean here we'll just

00:59:03.860 --> 00:59:05.270
look at binary inputs.

00:59:05.270 --> 00:59:09.370
You take u sub 0 and u sub 1,
and you look at what happens

00:59:09.370 --> 00:59:11.070
when you have those
two inputs.

00:59:11.070 --> 00:59:14.830
This is just a vector white
Gaussian noise problem that we

00:59:14.830 --> 00:59:17.570
looked at in quite a bit of
detail when we were studying

00:59:17.570 --> 00:59:19.580
decision theory.

00:59:19.580 --> 00:59:24.460
What we want to do is to look
at, I mean if these two

00:59:24.460 --> 00:59:28.540
signals are not antipodal to
each other you want to look at

00:59:28.540 --> 00:59:30.650
the mean of them.

00:59:30.650 --> 00:59:34.065
And you'll want to look at u sub
0 minus that mean, and u

00:59:34.065 --> 00:59:37.280
sub 1 minus that mean as
two antipodal signals.

00:59:37.280 --> 00:59:41.160
When you go through all of
that, you find that the

00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:45.020
maximum likelihood decision is
to take the real part of the

00:59:45.020 --> 00:59:53.490
output, of the inner product
of the output, with u sub 0

00:59:53.490 --> 00:59:58.026
convolved with g, and the real
part of v convolved with u sub

00:59:58.026 --> 00:59:59.510
1 convolved with G.

00:59:59.510 --> 01:00:02.520
OK in other words, what's
happening here is that as far

01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:07.340
as anybody is concerned, we're
not using u sub 0 and u sub 1

01:00:07.340 --> 01:00:09.330
in this making a decision.

01:00:09.330 --> 01:00:11.420
We know what the channel is.

01:00:11.420 --> 01:00:15.425
And therefore what exists right
before the white noise

01:00:15.425 --> 01:00:20.485
is added, is these two signals u
sub 0 convolved with g and u

01:00:20.485 --> 01:00:22.170
sub 1 convolved with g.

01:00:22.170 --> 01:00:24.480
So we're doing binary
detection on

01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:26.750
those two known signals.

01:00:26.750 --> 01:00:29.610
And we're using the output to
try to make the best choice

01:00:29.610 --> 01:00:30.500
between them.

01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:32.670
So this is the thing
that we do.

01:00:32.670 --> 01:00:36.300
So we want to use a filter
matched to u sub 0

01:00:36.300 --> 01:00:38.040
convolved with g.

01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:41.220
Now how do we build a filter
matched to a convolution of

01:00:41.220 --> 01:00:43.140
two things?

01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:45.880
Well we convolve
u sub 0 with g.

01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:48.080
And then we turn the
thing around.

01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:50.340
And then we see that after
turning it around what we've

01:00:50.340 --> 01:00:53.890
gotten is the turned around
version of u convolved with

01:00:53.890 --> 01:00:56.460
the turned around
version of g.

01:00:56.460 --> 01:00:57.770
I mean write it down
and you'll see that

01:00:57.770 --> 01:00:59.850
that's what you have.

01:00:59.850 --> 01:01:08.120
So what you wind up with is
the following figure.

01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:11.860
You either send u sub 0
or you send u sub 1.

01:01:11.860 --> 01:01:14.450
This is a way to send
one binary digit.

01:01:14.450 --> 01:01:20.060
We're sending it by using these
long PN sequences now.

01:01:20.060 --> 01:01:28.190
If u sub 0 goes through g, we
got a V prime out, which is

01:01:28.190 --> 01:01:30.880
the output before
noise is added.

01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:34.980
We then add noise so we get.

01:01:34.980 --> 01:01:38.610
And then we pass to try
to detect whether

01:01:38.610 --> 01:01:40.530
this or this is true.

01:01:40.530 --> 01:01:48.000
We take this output V. We
convolve it with u sub 1

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:52.060
convolved with g, and with
u sub 0 convolved with g.

01:01:52.060 --> 01:01:55.380
Now you'll all say I'm
wasting stuff here.

01:01:55.380 --> 01:01:59.490
Because I could just put the g
over here and then follow it

01:01:59.490 --> 01:02:02.850
with u sub 1 or u sub 0.

01:02:02.850 --> 01:02:04.090
Be patient for a little bit.

01:02:04.090 --> 01:02:05.390
I want to put both of them in.

01:02:05.390 --> 01:02:07.280
And I want to put them
in this order.

01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:10.580
And then I make a
decision here.

01:02:10.580 --> 01:02:14.520
OK well here comes the clincher
to the argument.

01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:17.500
Look at what happens
right there.

01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:24.120
If I forget about this and I
forget about this, what I get

01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:26.440
here is u sub 0 coming in.

01:02:26.440 --> 01:02:28.900
It's going through
the filter g.

01:02:28.900 --> 01:02:31.510
It has white noise
added to it.

01:02:31.510 --> 01:02:35.520
It goes through the matched
filter to u sub 0.

01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:38.770
And what comes out is
a measurement of g.

01:02:38.770 --> 01:02:39.650
That's what we showed before.

01:02:39.650 --> 01:02:42.740
When we were trying to measure
g, that was the way we did it.

01:02:42.740 --> 01:02:44.970
We started out with
a PN sequence, go

01:02:44.970 --> 01:02:47.240
through g, add noise--

01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:49.970
we can't avoid the noise-- go
through the matched filter.

01:02:49.970 --> 01:02:53.260
That is a measurement of
g at that point there.

01:02:53.260 --> 01:02:57.540
And if we send u sub 1, that's
a measurement of g at that

01:02:57.540 --> 01:02:59.050
point there.

01:02:59.050 --> 01:03:06.790
So finally we have the rake
receiver which does both of

01:03:06.790 --> 01:03:08.830
these things it once.

01:03:08.830 --> 01:03:11.670
You either send u sub
0 or u sub 1.

01:03:11.670 --> 01:03:12.810
You go through this filter.

01:03:12.810 --> 01:03:14.510
You add white noise.

01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:20.390
As far as making a decision is
concerned, you do what we

01:03:20.390 --> 01:03:22.310
talked about before.

01:03:22.310 --> 01:03:25.070
You compare this output
with this

01:03:25.070 --> 01:03:27.360
output to make a decision.

01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:31.270
After you make a decision you
go forward in time, because

01:03:31.270 --> 01:03:34.500
we've done everything backwards
in time here.

01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:39.290
And you take what is going to
come out of here, which hasn't

01:03:39.290 --> 01:03:40.460
come out yet.

01:03:40.460 --> 01:03:44.550
And you use that to make
a new estimate of g.

01:03:44.550 --> 01:03:48.180
You use that estimate of g
turned around in time, to

01:03:48.180 --> 01:03:54.260
alter your estimate of the
matched filter to g.

01:03:54.260 --> 01:03:57.090
And if you read the notes, the
notes explains what's going on

01:03:57.090 --> 01:03:59.230
as far as the timing in
here, a little bit

01:03:59.230 --> 01:04:00.940
better than I can here.

01:04:00.940 --> 01:04:02.970
But in fact, this is the kind
of circuit that people

01:04:02.970 --> 01:04:07.060
actually use to both measure
channels, and to send data at

01:04:07.060 --> 01:04:08.140
the same time.

01:04:08.140 --> 01:04:11.400
I want stop here because
we're supposed to

01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:13.300
evaluate the class.
