00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.330
PROFESSOR: Today I
want to get started

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.340
by correcting a mistake
that I made last time.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:37.410
And this was
mistaken terminology.

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.290
I said that what
we were computing,

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.480
when we computed in
this candy bar example,

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.510
was energy and not heat.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.270
But it's both.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.010
They're the same thing.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.320
And in fact, energy,
heat and work

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.470
are all the same
thing in physics.

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.895
I was foolishly
considering the much more

00:01:03.895 --> 00:01:08.350
- what am I trying to say -
the intuitive feeling of heat

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.720
as just being the
same as temperature.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:17.890
But in physics, usually
heat is measured in calories

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.480
and energy can be
in lots of things.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:26.610
Maybe kilowatt-hours or ergs,
these are various of the units.

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.840
And work would be in
things like foot-pounds.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.500
That is, lifting some
weight some distance.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.240
And the amount of force
you have to apply.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.070
And these all have
conversions between them.

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.880
They're all the same
quantity, in different units.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:54.030
OK, so these are
the same quantity.

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:00.850
Different units.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:08.850
So that's about as much
physics as we'll do for today.

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.290
And sorry about that.

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:18.800
Now, the example that I was
starting to discuss last time

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.980
and that I'm going
to carry out today

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:32.390
was this dartboard example.

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:40.160
We have a dartboard, which
is some kind of target.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:46.380
And we have a person,
your little brother,

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.540
who's standing over there.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.680
And somebody is throwing darts.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.790
And the question is, how
likely is he to be hit.

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.950
So I want to describe
to you how we're

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.550
going to make this problem
into a math problem.

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:03.050
Yep.

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.904
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:03.904 --> 00:03:06.070
PROFESSOR: What topic is
this that we're going over.

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.250
We're going over an example.

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.650
Which is a dartboard example.

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.090
And it has to do
with probability.

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.370
OK.

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:38.260
So what is the probability that
this guy, your little brother,

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:47.700
gets hit by a dart.

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.020
Now, we have to put some
assumptions into this problem

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:53.630
in order to make
it a math problem.

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.940
And I'm really going
to try to make them

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.630
pretty realistic assumptions.

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:09.580
So the first assumption is
that the number of hits is

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:21.520
proportional to some
constant times e^(-r^2).

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.910
So that's actually a kind
of a normal distribution.

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.560
That's the bell curve.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.250
But as a function of the radius.

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.060
So this is the
assumption that I'm

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.990
going to make in this problem.

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.970
And a problem in
probability is a problem

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.540
of the ratio of the
part to the whole.

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:53.580
So the part is where this
little guy is standing.

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.670
And the whole is all
the possible places

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:58.232
where the dart might hit.

00:04:58.232 --> 00:04:59.690
Which is maybe the
whole blackboard

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.670
or extending beyond,
depending on how good an aim

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:07.780
you think that this
older child has.

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.730
So, if you like, the part
is-- We'll start simply.

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:14.290
I mean, this doesn't
sweep all the way around.

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:17.170
But we're going to talk
about some section.

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:18.930
Like this.

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.400
Where this is some radius
r_1, and this other radius

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.460
is some longer radius, r_2.

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.830
And the part that we'll
first keep track of

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:29.470
is everything around there.

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:31.470
That's not very well
centered, but it's supposed

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:35.060
to be two concentric circles.

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:38.840
Maybe I should fix that a bit
so that it's a little bit easier

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:39.784
to read here.

00:05:39.784 --> 00:05:41.260
So here we go.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:46.700
So here I have radius r_1,
and here I have radius r_2.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.610
And then the region in
between is what we're

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:56.050
going to try to keep track of.

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:59.170
So I claim that we'll
be able to get--

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:04.100
So this is what I'm calling
the part, to start out with.

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:05.570
And then we'll take
a section of it

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:12.220
to get the place where
the person is standing.

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:22.157
Now, I want to take a
side view of e^(-r^2).

00:06:22.157 --> 00:06:23.740
The function that
we're talking about.

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:28.650
Again, that's the bell curve.

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:31.900
And it sort of looks like this.

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:36.090
This is the top value,
this is now the r-axis.

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:39.490
And this is up, or
at least-- So you

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:41.540
should think of this
in terms of the fact

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:46.900
that the horizontal here is
the plane of the dartboard.

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:49.390
And the vertical is
measuring how likely

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:52.460
it is that there will
be darts piling up here.

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:55.780
So if they were
balls tumbling down

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:57.690
or something else
falling on, many of them

00:06:57.690 --> 00:06:58.530
would pile up here.

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:02.890
Many fewer of them would
be piling up farther away.

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:06.430
And the chunk that
we're keeping track of

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:09.200
is the chunk
between r_1 and r_2.

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.590
That's the corresponding
region here.

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:14.180
And in order to
calculate this part,

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:20.500
we have to calculate this
volume of revolution.

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:21.350
Sweeping around.

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:24.160
Because really, in
disguise, this is a ring.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.480
This is a side view,
it's really a ring.

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:33.100
Because we're rotating
it around this axis here.

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:34.990
So we're trying
to figure out what

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:36.800
the total volume
of that ring is.

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:39.930
And that's going to be our
weighting, our likelihood

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:41.390
for whether the
hits are occurring

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:51.240
in this section, or in
this ring, versus the rest.

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.750
To set this up, I
remind you we're going

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:57.570
to use the method of shells.

00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:03.030
That's really the only one
that's going to work here.

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:07.990
And we want to integrate
between r_1 and r_2.

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:12.280
And the range here is that--
Because this is, if you like,

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:13.470
a solid of revolution.

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:17.250
So the variable r is the same
as what we used to call x.

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:18.924
And it's ranging
between r_1 and r_2,

00:08:18.924 --> 00:08:20.340
and then we're
sweeping it around.

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:25.920
And the circumference
of a little piece,

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:35.040
so at a fixed distance r
here, the circumference

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:37.950
is going to be 2 pi r.

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:40.240
So 2 pi r is the circumference.

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.710
And then the height is the
height of that green stem

00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:43.210
there.

00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:45.460
That's e^(-r^2).

00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:50.460
And then we're multiplying by
the thickness, which is dr.

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:52.530
So the thickness
of the green is dr.

00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:57.860
The height of this little
green guy is e^(-r^2),

00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:01.310
and the circumference is
2 pi times the radius,

00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:03.701
when we sweep the circle around.

00:09:03.701 --> 00:09:04.200
Question.

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:21.970
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:23.850
PROFESSOR: So the
question is, why

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:28.020
is what we're interested
in not this pink area.

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:31.810
And the reason is
an interpretation

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:33.430
of what I meant by this.

00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:38.310
What I meant by this is
that if you wanted to add up

00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:42.190
what the likelihood is that this
thing will be here versus here,

00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:44.940
I want it to be,
really, the proportions

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:47.780
are the number of hits
times the, if you like,

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:49.590
I wanted it d area.

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:51.850
That's really what I meant here.

00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:56.740
The number of hits
in a little chunk.

00:09:56.740 --> 00:10:01.370
So little, maybe I'll call
it delta A. A little chunk.

00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:04.480
Is proportional to
the chunk times that.

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:05.920
So there's already
an area factor.

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:06.920
And there's a height.

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:09.580
So there are a total of
three dimensions involved.

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:13.120
There's the area and
then this height.

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:18.640
So it's a matter of the--
what I was given, what I

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:21.720
intended to say the problem is.

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:22.720
Yeah, another question.

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:25.084
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:25.084 --> 00:10:26.000
PROFESSOR: Yeah, yeah.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.060
Exactly.

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:30.570
The height is c times
that, whatever this c is.

00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:32.220
In fact, we don't
know what the c is,

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:34.460
but because we're going to
have a part and a whole,

00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:37.490
we'll divide, the c
will always cancel.

00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:39.240
So I'm throwing the c out.

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:42.750
I don't know what it is, and
in the end it won't matter.

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:44.330
That's a very
important question.

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:44.830
Yes.

00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:49.180
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:50.180
PROFESSOR: Say it again?

00:10:50.180 --> 00:11:02.040
STUDENT: PROFESSOR:

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:05.920
PROFESSOR: So what I mean is the
number of hits in some chunk.

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:09.520
That is, suppose you
imagine, the question

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:11.720
is, what does this
left-hand side mean.

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:12.250
That right?

00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:17.690
Is that the question
that's you're asking?

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:21.040
When I try to understand
what the distribution

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:25.420
of dartboard hits is, I
should imagine my dartboard.

00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:28.400
And very often there'll
be a whole bunch

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:29.700
of holes in some places.

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:30.810
And fewer holes else.

00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:33.010
I'm trying to figure out
what the whole distribution

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:35.590
of those marks is.

00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:38.410
And so some places will
have more hits on them

00:11:38.410 --> 00:11:41.060
and some places will
have fewer hits on them.

00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:43.980
And so what I want to
measure is, on average,

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:44.910
the number of hits.

00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:47.387
So this would really
be some-- This constant

00:11:47.387 --> 00:11:49.470
of proportionality is
ambiguous because it depends

00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:50.553
on how many times you try.

00:11:50.553 --> 00:11:52.470
If you throw a
thousand times, it'll

00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:54.320
be much more densely packed.

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:58.780
And if you have only a
hundred times it'll be fewer.

00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:01.850
So that's where this
constant comes in.

00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:04.610
But given that you have
a certain number of times

00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:06.790
that you tried, say,
a thousand times,

00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:09.500
there will be a whole bunch
more piled in the middle.

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:12.020
And fewer and fewer as
you get farther away.

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:15.800
Assuming that the person's
aim is reasonable.

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:17.024
So that's what we're saying.

00:12:17.024 --> 00:12:19.440
So we're thinking in terms
of-- The person's always aiming

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:20.065
for the center.

00:12:20.065 --> 00:12:22.660
So it's most likely that the
person will hit the center.

00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:24.820
But on the other hand,
it's a fallible person,

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:26.440
so the person may miss.

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:29.272
And so it's less and less
likely as you go farther out.

00:12:29.272 --> 00:12:31.480
And we're just counting how
many times this gets hit,

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:33.220
how many time this and so on.

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:34.830
In proportion to the area.

00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:40.460
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:42.252
PROFESSOR: Yeah. r_1
and r_2 are arbitrary.

00:12:42.252 --> 00:12:44.251
We're going to make this
calculation in general.

00:12:44.251 --> 00:12:46.240
We're going to calculate
what the likelihood is

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:50.290
that we hit any possible band.

00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:53.010
And I want to leave those
as just letters for now.

00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:54.990
The r_1 and the r_2.

00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:57.110
Because I want to be able
to try various different

00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:57.990
possibilities.

00:12:57.990 --> 00:13:03.730
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:06.310
PROFESSOR: Say it again, why
do we have to take volume?

00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:08.830
So this is what we
were addressing before.

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:13.900
It's a volume because it's
number of hit per unit area.

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:17.590
So there's a height,
that is, number of hits.

00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:19.820
And then there's an area
and the product of those

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:22.610
is-- So this is, if
you like, a histogram

00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:25.100
of the number of hits.

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:26.910
But this should be
measured per area.

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:29.400
Not per length of r.

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:32.020
Because on the real diagram,
it's going all the way around.

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:35.760
There's a lot more
area to this red band

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:41.150
than just the distance implies.

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:42.940
OK.

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:47.460
So, having discussed
the setup, this

00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:49.770
is a pretty standard setup--
Oh, one more question.

00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:50.270
Yes.

00:13:50.270 --> 00:14:13.564
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:13.564 --> 00:14:14.230
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:17.700
So the question is, why
is this a realistic.

00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:21.260
Why is this choice of
function here, e^(-r^2),

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:25.670
a realistic choice of
function for the darts.

00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:30.480
So I can answer this
with an analogy.

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:32.800
When people were
asking themselves

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:38.120
where the V-2 rockets
from Germany hit London,

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:39.170
they used this model.

00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:43.100
It turned out to be the one
which was the most accurate.

00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:48.630
So that gives you an idea
that this is actually real.

00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:53.670
The question, this makes it
look like people are masters.

00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:56.940
That is, that they'll
all hit in the center

00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:58.870
more often than elsewhere.

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:03.960
But that's actually
somewhat deceptive.

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:08.040
There's a difference
between the mode,

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:13.510
that is, the most likely spot,
and what happens on average.

00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:17.960
So in other words, the single
most likely spot is the center.

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:20.720
But there's rather little
area in here, and in fact

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:24.860
the likelihood of hitting
that is some little tiny bit.

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:25.620
In here.

00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:29.850
In fact, you're much more
likely to be out here.

00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:31.539
So if you take the
total of the volume,

00:15:31.539 --> 00:15:32.955
you'll see that
much of the volume

00:15:32.955 --> 00:15:34.260
is contributed from out here.

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:37.780
And in fact, the person hits
rather rarely near the center.

00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:42.737
So this is not a
ridiculous thing to do.

00:15:42.737 --> 00:15:45.320
If you think of it in terms of
somebody's aiming at the center

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:46.950
but there's some
random thing which

00:15:46.950 --> 00:15:49.770
is throwing the
person off, then there

00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:51.710
is likely to be to
left or to the right,

00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:54.080
or they might even get
lucky and all those errors

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:55.470
cancel themselves
and they happen

00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:59.090
to hit pretty much
near the center.

00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:00.240
Yeah, another question.

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:06.266
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] PROFESSOR:
How does the little brother

00:16:06.266 --> 00:16:06.890
come into play?

00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:09.390
The little brother is going
to come into play as follows.

00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:11.300
I'll tell you in advance.

00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:15.500
So the thing is, the little
brother was not so stupid

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:19.760
as to stand in
front of the target.

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:22.220
I know.

00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:26.800
He stood about twice the
radius of the target away.

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:29.960
And so, we're going to
approximate the location

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:32.460
by some sector here.

00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:35.920
Which is just going to be some
chunk of one of these things.

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:38.010
We'll just break
off a piece of it.

00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:39.850
And that's how we're
going to capture.

00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:42.030
So the point is,
the target is here.

00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:46.000
But there is the possibility
that the seven-year-old

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.550
who's throwing the darts
actually missed the target.

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:50.780
That actually happens a lot.

00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:54.660
So, does that answer
your question?

00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:55.530
Alright.

00:16:55.530 --> 00:16:57.170
Are we ready now to to do this?

00:16:57.170 --> 00:16:57.950
One more question.

00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:05.250
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:08.320
PROFESSOR: I'm giving
you this property here.

00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:10.110
I'm telling you
that-- This is what's

00:17:10.110 --> 00:17:12.540
called a mathematical
model, when you give

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:13.900
somebody something like this.

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:16.450
In fact, that requires
further justification.

00:17:16.450 --> 00:17:19.120
It's an interesting issue.

00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:19.620
Yeah.

00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:26.084
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:26.084 --> 00:17:27.750
PROFESSOR: I'm giving
it to you for now.

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:30.120
And it's something which
really has to be justified.

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:32.080
In certain circumstances
it is justified.

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:37.620
But, OK.

00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:43.800
So anyway, here's our part.

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:46.200
This is going to be
our chunk, for now,

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:50.760
that we're going to
estimate the importance,

00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:56.210
the relative importance, of.

00:17:56.210 --> 00:18:01.460
And now, this is something whose
antiderivative we can just do

00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:03.600
by substitution or by guessing.

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:07.870
It's just -pi e^(-r^2).

00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:10.650
If you differentiate
that, you get a -2r, which

00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:12.730
cancels the minus sign here.

00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:15.370
So you get 2pi r e^(-r^2).

00:18:15.370 --> 00:18:18.400
So that's the antiderivative.

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:24.710
And we're evaluating
it at r_1 and r_2.

00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:28.490
So with the minus sign
that's going to get reversed.

00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:33.350
The answer is going to
be pi times e^(-r_1^2),

00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:39.090
that's the bottom one, minus
e^(r_2^2), that's the top.

00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:45.777
So this is what
our part gives us.

00:18:45.777 --> 00:18:48.110
And, more technically, if you
wanted to multiply through

00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:50.350
by c, it would be c times this.

00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:55.140
I'll say that in just a second.

00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:59.280
OK, now I want to
work-- So, if you like,

00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:06.490
the part is equal to, maybe
even I'll call it c pi,

00:19:06.490 --> 00:19:07.740
times e^(-r_1^2) - e^(-r_2^2).

00:19:12.429 --> 00:19:14.470
That's what it really is
if I put in this factor.

00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:17.690
So now there's no prejudice as
to how many attempts we make.

00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:20.490
Whether it was a thousand
attempts or a million

00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:22.740
attempts at the target.

00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:25.480
Now, the most important
second feature

00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:27.250
here of these kinds
of modeling problems

00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:30.560
is, there is always some
kind of idealization.

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:33.070
And the next thing that I
want to discuss with you

00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:36.940
is the interpretation
of the whole.

00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:41.870
That is, what's the family
of all possibilities.

00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:45.790
And in this case, what
I'm going to claim

00:19:45.790 --> 00:19:50.160
is that the reasonable
way to think of the whole

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:55.940
is it's that r can range all
the way from 0 to infinity.

00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:57.210
Now, you may not like this.

00:19:57.210 --> 00:20:01.730
But these are maybe my first
and third favorite number,

00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:03.810
my second favorite
number being 1.

00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:07.930
So infinity is a
really useful concept.

00:20:07.930 --> 00:20:12.010
Of course, it's nonsense in
the context of the darts.

00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:14.770
Because if you think
of the basement wall

00:20:14.770 --> 00:20:17.140
where the kid might
miss a target,

00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:19.619
he'd probably hit the wall.

00:20:19.619 --> 00:20:22.160
He's probably not going to hit
one of the walls to the right,

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:25.080
and anyway he's certainly
not going to hit over there.

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:28.870
So there's something
artificial about sending

00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:32.390
the possibility of hits all
the way out to infinity.

00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:34.850
On the other hand, the
shape of this curve

00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:38.310
is such that the
real tail ends here,

00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:40.990
because of this exponential
decrease, are tiny.

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:42.630
And that's negligible.

00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:45.700
And the point is that
actually the value,

00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:47.550
if you go all the
way out to infinity,

00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:50.020
is the easiest
value to calculate.

00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:52.697
So by doing this, I'm
idealizing the problem

00:20:52.697 --> 00:20:54.530
but I'm actually making
the numbers come out

00:20:54.530 --> 00:20:55.890
much more cleanly.

00:20:55.890 --> 00:20:58.180
And this is just always
done in mathematics.

00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:00.290
That's what we did when
we went from differences

00:21:00.290 --> 00:21:02.460
to differentials,
to differentiation

00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:04.640
and infinitesimals.

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:06.282
So we like that.

00:21:06.282 --> 00:21:08.740
Because it makes things easier,
not because it makes things

00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:10.320
harder.

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:12.240
So we're just going to
pretend the whole is

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:13.450
from 0 to infinity.

00:21:13.450 --> 00:21:15.550
And now let's just
see what it is.

00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:21.330
It's c pi times, the
starting place is e^(-0^2).

00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:24.630
That's r_1, right, this is the
role that r_1 plays is this,

00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:26.374
and the r_2 is this value.

00:21:26.374 --> 00:21:27.290
Minus e^(-infinity^2).

00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:33.940
Which is that negligibly
small number, 0.

00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:36.750
So this is just c pi.

00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:39.700
Because this number is 1,
and this other number is 0.

00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:48.420
This is just (1 - 0), in
the parentheses there.

00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:52.300
And now I can tell you
from these two numbers

00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:54.990
what the probability is.

00:21:54.990 --> 00:21:58.450
The probability that
we landed on the target

00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:04.250
in a radius between r_1 and r_2,
so that's this annulus here,

00:22:04.250 --> 00:22:12.350
is the ratio of the
part to the whole.

00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:16.060
Which in this case
just cancels the c pi.

00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:21.280
So it's e^(-r_1^2) - e^(-r_2^2).

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:25.520
There's the formula
for the probability.

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:28.100
So the c canceled
and the pi canceled.

00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:32.170
It's all gone.

00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:34.040
Now, again, let
me just emphasize

00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:35.750
the way this formula
is supposed to work.

00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:42.210
The total probability
of every possibility

00:22:42.210 --> 00:22:45.900
here is supposed to
be set up to be 1.

00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:48.530
This is some fraction of 1.

00:22:48.530 --> 00:22:51.191
If you like, it's a percent.

00:22:51.191 --> 00:22:51.690
Yes.

00:22:51.690 --> 00:22:57.149
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:57.149 --> 00:22:59.690
PROFESSOR: This one is giving--
The question is, doesn't this

00:22:59.690 --> 00:23:00.780
just give the
probability of the ring?

00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:02.620
This gives you the
probability of the ring,

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:05.510
but this is a very,
very wide ring.

00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:08.479
This is a ring starting with
0, nothing, on the inside.

00:23:08.479 --> 00:23:09.770
And then going all the way out.

00:23:09.770 --> 00:23:11.880
So that's everything.

00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:13.380
So this corresponds
to everything.

00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:22.650
This corresponds to a ring.

00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:24.990
So now, let's see.

00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:26.390
Where do I want to go from here.

00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:28.550
So in order to
make progress here,

00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:31.230
I still have to give you one
more piece of information.

00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:35.650
And this is, again,
supposed to be realistic.

00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:40.350
When I was three years old
and my brother's friend Ralph

00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:43.920
was seven, I watched him
throwing darts a lot.

00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:54.200
And I would say that for Ralph,
so for Ralph, at age seven,

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:57.080
anyway, later on he got
a little better at it.

00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:59.950
But Ralph at age seven,
the probability that he

00:23:59.950 --> 00:24:08.440
hit the target was about 1/2.

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:09.660
Right?

00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:12.040
So he hit the target
about half the time.

00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:14.560
And the other times,
there was cement

00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:17.870
on the walls of the
basement, it wasn't that bad.

00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:19.250
Just bounced off.

00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:22.000
That also meant that the points
got a little blunter as time

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:22.560
went on.

00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:26.150
So it was a little less
dangerous when they hit.

00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:26.650
Alright.

00:24:26.650 --> 00:24:33.210
So now, so here's the extra
assumption that I want to make.

00:24:33.210 --> 00:24:41.260
So a is going to be the
radius of the target.

00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:45.660
Now, the other realistic
assumption that I want to make

00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:49.170
is where this little
kid would be standing.

00:24:49.170 --> 00:24:51.650
And now, here, I want
to get very specific

00:24:51.650 --> 00:24:54.280
and just do the
computation in one case.

00:24:54.280 --> 00:25:00.430
We're going to imagine
the target is here.

00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:03.200
And the kid is standing,
say, between-- So we'll just

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:04.430
do a section of this.

00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:13.130
This is between 3
o'clock and 5 o'clock.

00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:16.740
There's more of him, but it's
lower down and maybe negligible

00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:17.350
here.

00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:20.400
So this section is
the part, the chunk

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:23.330
that we want to see about.

00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:31.210
And this is a, and then
this distance here is 2a.

00:25:31.210 --> 00:25:35.330
And then the longest
distance here is 3a.

00:25:35.330 --> 00:25:39.000
So the longest distance is 3a.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.870
So in other words,
what I'm saying

00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:50.180
is that the probability, if
you're standing too close,

00:25:50.180 --> 00:26:06.660
the chance Ralph hits younger
brother is about 1/6-- Right?

00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:12.820
Because 2/12 = 1/6.

00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:22.020
1/6 of the probability that
we're between a and 3a.

00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:29.052
That's the number that
we're looking for.

00:26:29.052 --> 00:26:29.760
Another question.

00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:33.900
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:36.680
PROFESSOR: The 2/12 came from
the fact that we assumed.

00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:39.250
So we made a very, very
bold assumption here.

00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:41.530
We assumed that
this human being,

00:26:41.530 --> 00:26:46.760
who is actually standing--
The floor is about down here.

00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:48.460
Maybe he wasn't that tall.

00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:51.560
But anyway, so he's really
a little bigger than this.

00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:53.850
That the part of him that
was close to the target

00:26:53.850 --> 00:27:00.500
covered about this section
here, between radius 2a and 3a.

00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:02.740
As you'll see, actually
from the computation,

00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:07.290
because the likelihood drops
off pretty quickly, whatever

00:27:07.290 --> 00:27:09.140
of him was standing
outside there

00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:11.269
wouldn't have mattered anyway.

00:27:11.269 --> 00:27:13.060
So we're just worried
about the part that's

00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:18.677
closest to the target here.

00:27:18.677 --> 00:27:19.510
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:20.801
PROFESSOR: Why is it out of 12?

00:27:20.801 --> 00:27:22.650
Because I made it a clock.

00:27:22.650 --> 00:27:25.110
And I made it from 3
o'clock to 5 o'clock,

00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:28.790
so it's 2 of the 12
hours of a clock.

00:27:28.790 --> 00:27:32.640
It's just a way of me making
a section that you can visibly

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:36.400
see.

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:40.060
So now, so here's what
we're trying to calculate.

00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:47.790
And in order to figure this
out, I need one more item. here.

00:27:47.790 --> 00:27:49.870
So maybe I'll leave myself
a little bit of room.

00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:52.010
I have to figure out
something about what

00:27:52.010 --> 00:27:53.830
our information gave us.

00:27:53.830 --> 00:28:00.380
Which is that the probability,
sorry, this probability

00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:01.690
was 1/2.

00:28:01.690 --> 00:28:03.580
So let's remember what this is.

00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:09.470
This is going to be
e^(-0^2) - e^(-a^2).

00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:11.180
That's what's this
probability is.

00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:16.210
And that's equal to 1/2.

00:28:16.210 --> 00:28:21.330
So that means that -
1 - e^(-a^2). = 1/2.

00:28:21.330 --> 00:28:26.620
Which means that e^(-a^2) = 1/2.

00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:28.220
I'm not going to
calculate a, this

00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:30.050
is the part about the
information about a

00:28:30.050 --> 00:28:32.480
that I want to use.

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:33.520
That's what I'll use.

00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:36.250
And now I'm going to calculate
this other probability here.

00:28:36.250 --> 00:28:41.590
So the probability
right up there is this.

00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:47.390
And that's going to be the same
as e^(-(2a)^2) - e^(-(3a)^2).

00:28:51.610 --> 00:28:54.650
That's what we calculated.

00:28:54.650 --> 00:28:59.200
And now I want to use some of
the arithmetic of exponents.

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:01.380
This is (e^(-a^2))^2.

00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:11.890
Because it's really (2a)^2
is 4-- the quantity is 4a^2,

00:29:11.890 --> 00:29:14.580
and then I bring
that exponent out.

00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:19.740
Minus e^(-a^2) to the
9th power, that's 3^2.

00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:28.560
And so this comes out
to be (1/2)^4 - (1/2)^9.

00:29:36.190 --> 00:29:39.340
Which is approximately 1/16.

00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:40.380
This is negligible.

00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:41.180
This part here.

00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:43.110
And this is actually
why these tails,

00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:48.130
as you go out to infinity,
don't really matter that much.

00:29:48.130 --> 00:29:49.880
So this is a much
smaller number.

00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:53.390
So the probability of
the whole band is 1/16.

00:29:53.390 --> 00:29:55.720
And now I can answer
the question up here.

00:29:55.720 --> 00:30:01.110
This is approximately
1/6 * 1/16.

00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:07.340
Which is about
1/100, or about 1%.

00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:13.340
So if I stood there
for 100 attempts,

00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:18.720
then my chances of getting
hit were pretty high.

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:27.970
So that's the computation.

00:30:27.970 --> 00:30:34.940
That's a typical example of
a problem in probability.

00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:36.860
And let me just make
one more connection

00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:42.660
with what we did before.

00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:46.130
This is connected to weighted
averages or integrals

00:30:46.130 --> 00:30:47.470
over weights.

00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:53.110
But the weight that's
involved in this problem

00:30:53.110 --> 00:30:59.810
was w(r) is equal to-- So let's
just look at what happened

00:30:59.810 --> 00:31:01.520
in all of those integrals.

00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:03.790
What happened in all
the integrals was, we

00:31:03.790 --> 00:31:09.060
had this factor here, 2 pi r.

00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:23.330
And if I include this c, it
was really 2 pi c r e^(-r^2).

00:31:23.330 --> 00:31:27.960
This was the weight
that we were using.

00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:30.770
The relative
importance of things.

00:31:30.770 --> 00:31:34.260
Now, this is not the same as
the e^(-r^2) that we started out

00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:34.760
with.

00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:38.000
Because this is the
one-dimensional histogram.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.850
And that has to do with the
method of shells that gave us

00:31:40.850 --> 00:31:43.210
that extra factor of r here.

00:31:43.210 --> 00:31:45.090
So that also connects
with the question

00:31:45.090 --> 00:31:47.610
at the beginning, which had
to do with this paradox,

00:31:47.610 --> 00:31:50.420
that it looks like these
places in the middle

00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:51.440
are the most likely.

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:54.500
But that's the plot e^(-r^2).

00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:57.240
If you actually look
at this plot here,

00:31:57.240 --> 00:32:00.330
you see that as r goes
to 0, it's going to 0.

00:32:00.330 --> 00:32:03.010
This is a different graph here.

00:32:03.010 --> 00:32:07.720
And actually, so this is
what's happening really.

00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:09.730
In terms of how likely
it is that you'll

00:32:09.730 --> 00:32:18.392
get within a certain distance
of the center of the target.

00:32:18.392 --> 00:32:20.850
Again, it's not the area under
that curve that we're doing.

00:32:20.850 --> 00:32:27.940
It's that volume of revolution.

00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:29.494
We're going to
change subjects now.

00:32:29.494 --> 00:32:30.410
OK, one more question.

00:32:30.410 --> 00:32:31.937
Yes.

00:32:31.937 --> 00:32:32.770
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:32.770 --> 00:32:36.120
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's supposed
to be the graph of w(r).

00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:47.359
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:47.359 --> 00:32:48.900
PROFESSOR: Well,
so, the question is,

00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:50.983
wouldn't the importance
of the center be greatest?

00:32:50.983 --> 00:32:53.790
It's a question of which
variable you're using.

00:32:53.790 --> 00:32:57.057
According to pure
radius, it's not.

00:32:57.057 --> 00:32:58.640
It turns out that
there are some bands

00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:00.930
in radius which are more
important, more likely

00:33:00.930 --> 00:33:06.206
for hits than others.

00:33:06.206 --> 00:33:07.580
It really has to
do with the fact

00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:10.980
that the center, or the core,
of the target is really tiny.

00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:11.950
So it's harder to hit.

00:33:11.950 --> 00:33:16.170
Whereas a whole band around the
outside has a lot more area.

00:33:16.170 --> 00:33:18.500
Many, many ways
to hit that band.

00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:19.810
So it's a much larger area.

00:33:19.810 --> 00:33:24.220
So there's a competition there
between those two things.

00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:25.910
So we're going to move on.

00:33:25.910 --> 00:33:28.170
And I want to talk now
about a different kind

00:33:28.170 --> 00:33:30.550
of weighted average.

00:33:30.550 --> 00:33:36.410
These weighted averages are
going to be much simpler.

00:33:36.410 --> 00:34:01.260
And they come up in what's
called numerical integration.

00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:04.597
There are many, many methods
of integrating numerically.

00:34:04.597 --> 00:34:06.680
And they're important
because many, many integrals

00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:08.510
don't have formulas.

00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:13.980
And so you have to compute them
with a calculator or a machine.

00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:24.400
So the first type that we've
already done are Riemann sums.

00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:28.170
They turned out to be
incredibly inefficient.

00:34:28.170 --> 00:34:30.270
They're lousy.

00:34:30.270 --> 00:34:32.120
The next rule that
I'm going to describe

00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:33.370
is a little improvement.

00:34:33.370 --> 00:34:38.130
It's called the
trapezoidal rule.

00:34:38.130 --> 00:34:41.340
And this one is
much more reasonable

00:34:41.340 --> 00:34:43.370
than the Riemann sum.

00:34:43.370 --> 00:34:49.140
Unfortunately, it's
actually also pretty lousy.

00:34:49.140 --> 00:34:53.150
There's another rule which is
just a slightly trickier rule.

00:34:53.150 --> 00:34:56.030
And it's actually
amazing that it exists.

00:34:56.030 --> 00:35:01.750
And it's called Simpson's Rule.

00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:06.690
And this one is
actually pretty good.

00:35:06.690 --> 00:35:07.770
It's clever.

00:35:07.770 --> 00:35:12.320
So let's get started with these.

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:15.030
And the way I'll get
started is by reminding you

00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:16.030
what the Riemann sum is.

00:35:16.030 --> 00:35:17.779
So this is a good
review, because you need

00:35:17.779 --> 00:35:19.790
to know all three of these.

00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:26.540
And you're going to want to see
them all laid out in parallel.

00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:31.800
So here's the setup.

00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:33.580
OK, so here we go.

00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:36.660
We have our graph, we have our
function, it starts out at a,

00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:38.240
it ends up at b.

00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:40.160
Maybe goes on, but we're
only paying attention

00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:41.380
to this interval.

00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:44.760
This is a function y = f(x).

00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:48.160
And we split it up when
we do Riemann sums.

00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:50.450
So this is 1, this
is Riemann sums.

00:35:50.450 --> 00:35:53.930
We start out with a, which
is a point we call x_0,

00:35:53.930 --> 00:35:57.370
and then we go a
certain distance.

00:35:57.370 --> 00:35:58.710
We go all the way over to b.

00:35:58.710 --> 00:36:04.150
And we subdivide this
thing with these delta x's.

00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:08.130
Which are the step sizes.

00:36:08.130 --> 00:36:12.840
So we have these little
steps of size delta x.

00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:18.860
Corresponding to these x values,
we have y values. y_0 = f(x_0),

00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:21.090
that's the point above a.

00:36:21.090 --> 00:36:26.840
Then y_1 = f(x_1), that's
the point above x_1.

00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:33.120
And so forth, all the way
up to y_n, which is f(x_n).

00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:35.650
In order to figure out
the area, you really

00:36:35.650 --> 00:36:37.400
need to know something
about the function.

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:39.217
You need to be able
to evaluate it.

00:36:39.217 --> 00:36:40.300
So that's what we've done.

00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:43.330
We've evaluated here
at n + 1 points.

00:36:43.330 --> 00:36:46.150
Enumerated 0 through n.

00:36:46.150 --> 00:36:48.910
And those are the
numbers out of which

00:36:48.910 --> 00:36:53.390
we're going to get all of our
approximations to the integral.

00:36:53.390 --> 00:36:56.370
So somehow we want
average these numbers.

00:36:56.370 --> 00:37:01.780
So here's our goal.

00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:14.450
Our goal is to average, or add,
I'm using average very loosely

00:37:14.450 --> 00:37:14.950
here.

00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:18.830
But I was going to say
add up these numbers

00:37:18.830 --> 00:37:25.750
to get an approximation.

00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:30.730
To average or add the y's.

00:37:30.730 --> 00:37:37.670
To get an approximation
to the integral.

00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:43.410
Which we know is the
area under the curve.

00:37:43.410 --> 00:37:49.730
So here's what the
Riemann sum is.

00:37:49.730 --> 00:37:51.020
It's the following thing.

00:37:51.020 --> 00:37:56.030
You take y_0 plus y_1
plus... up to y_(n-1).

00:37:56.030 --> 00:37:57.520
And you multiply by delta x.

00:37:57.520 --> 00:38:00.040
That's it.

00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:07.010
Now, this one is the
one with left endpoints.

00:38:07.010 --> 00:38:09.350
So the left-hand sum.

00:38:09.350 --> 00:38:11.120
There's also a right one.

00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:13.210
Which is, if you start
at the right-hand ends.

00:38:13.210 --> 00:38:17.830
And that will go
from y_1 to y_n.

00:38:17.830 --> 00:38:22.170
OK, so this one
is the right-hand.

00:38:22.170 --> 00:38:25.170
Right Riemann sum.

00:38:25.170 --> 00:38:33.110
Those are the two
that we did before.

00:38:33.110 --> 00:38:35.940
Now I'm going to describe
to you the next two.

00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:42.410
They have a similar
pattern to them.

00:38:42.410 --> 00:38:51.200
And the one with trapezoids
requires a picture.

00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:53.110
Here's a shape.

00:38:53.110 --> 00:39:00.690
And here's a bunch of values.

00:39:00.690 --> 00:39:08.870
And we're trying to estimate
the size of these chunks.

00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:10.950
And now, instead of doing
something stupid, which

00:39:10.950 --> 00:39:14.050
is to draw horizontal
lines in rectangles,

00:39:14.050 --> 00:39:16.320
we're going to do something
slightly more clever.

00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:21.550
Which is to draw straight
lines that are diagonal.

00:39:21.550 --> 00:39:23.177
You see that many
of them actually

00:39:23.177 --> 00:39:25.510
coincide probably pretty
closely with what I drew there.

00:39:25.510 --> 00:39:29.650
Although if they're curved,
they miss by a little bit.

00:39:29.650 --> 00:39:32.270
So this is called
the trapezoidal rule.

00:39:32.270 --> 00:39:35.660
Because if you pick one of
these shapes, say this is y_2

00:39:35.660 --> 00:39:40.120
and this is y_3, if you
pick one of these shapes,

00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:44.440
this height here is y_2,
and this height is y_3,

00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:47.720
and this base is delta x.

00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:52.590
This is a trapezoid.

00:39:52.590 --> 00:40:01.500
So this being a trapezoid,
I can figure out its area.

00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:02.760
And what do I get?

00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:12.020
I get the base times
the average height.

00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:14.470
If you think about
if, you work out

00:40:14.470 --> 00:40:16.060
what happens when
you do something

00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:18.220
with a straight line
on top, like that,

00:40:18.220 --> 00:40:21.080
you'll get this average.

00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:31.450
So this is the average
height of the trapezoid.

00:40:31.450 --> 00:40:34.580
And now I want to add up.

00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:41.600
I want to add them all
up to get my formula

00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:45.190
for the trapezoidal rule.

00:40:45.190 --> 00:40:46.090
So what do I do?

00:40:46.090 --> 00:40:50.210
I have delta x
times the first one.

00:40:50.210 --> 00:40:53.040
Which is (y_0 + y_1) / 2.

00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:55.010
That's the first trapezoid.

00:40:55.010 --> 00:40:59.520
The next one is (y_1 + y_2) / 2.

00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:01.710
And this keeps on going.

00:41:01.710 --> 00:41:07.790
And at the end, I have
(y_(n-2) + y_(n-1)) / 2.

00:41:07.790 --> 00:41:10.110
And then last of all, I
have (y_(n-1) + y_n) / 2.

00:41:14.610 --> 00:41:16.560
That's a very long formula here.

00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:21.390
We're going to simplify it
quite a bit in just a second.

00:41:21.390 --> 00:41:22.600
What's this equal to?

00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:28.820
Well, notice that I get
y_0 / 2 to start out with.

00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:32.930
And now, y_1 got
mentioned twice.

00:41:32.930 --> 00:41:35.400
Each time with a factor of 1/2.

00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:39.405
So we get a whole y_1 in here.

00:41:39.405 --> 00:41:40.780
And the same thing
is going to be

00:41:40.780 --> 00:41:43.940
true of all the middle terms.

00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:48.580
You're going to get y_2 and
all the way up to y_(n-1).

00:41:48.580 --> 00:41:53.750
But then, the last one is
unmatched. y_n is only 1/2,

00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:59.790
only counts 1/2.

00:41:59.790 --> 00:42:17.590
So here is what's known
as the trapezoidal rule.

00:42:17.590 --> 00:42:19.430
Now, I'd like to
compare it for you

00:42:19.430 --> 00:42:25.480
to the Riemann sums, which are
sitting just to the left here.

00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:28.900
Here's the left one, and
here's the right one.

00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:32.570
If you take the average
of the left and the right,

00:42:32.570 --> 00:42:34.960
that is, a half of this
plus a half of that,

00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:36.370
there's an overlap.

00:42:36.370 --> 00:42:39.250
The y_1 through y_n
things are listed in both.

00:42:39.250 --> 00:42:41.860
But the y_0 only
gets counted 1/2

00:42:41.860 --> 00:42:44.170
and the y_n only
gets counted 1/2.

00:42:44.170 --> 00:42:46.740
So what this is, is this
is the symmetric compromise

00:42:46.740 --> 00:42:49.710
between the two Riemann sums.

00:42:49.710 --> 00:42:54.410
This is actually equal
to the left Riemann

00:42:54.410 --> 00:43:02.020
sum plus the right
Riemann sum divided by 2.

00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:10.600
It's the average of them.

00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:13.340
Now, this would be great and
it does look like it's closer.

00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:16.500
But actually it's not as
impressive as it looks.

00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:18.910
If you actually
do it in practice,

00:43:18.910 --> 00:43:23.190
it's not very efficient.

00:43:23.190 --> 00:43:25.120
Although it's way better
than a Riemann sum,

00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:27.560
it's still not good enough.

00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:37.250
So now I need to describe
to you the fancier rule.

00:43:37.250 --> 00:43:52.010
Which is known as
Simpson's Rule.

00:43:52.010 --> 00:44:00.160
And so, this is, if
you like, 3, Method 3.

00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:09.770
The idea is again to
divide things into chunks.

00:44:09.770 --> 00:44:16.690
But now it always
needs n to be even.

00:44:16.690 --> 00:44:20.750
In other words, we're going
to deal not with just one box,

00:44:20.750 --> 00:44:24.800
we're going to deal
with pairs of boxes.

00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:28.370
Here's delta x, and
here's delta x again.

00:44:28.370 --> 00:44:34.720
And we're going to study
the area of this piece here.

00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:39.270
So let me focus
just on that part.

00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:50.700
Let's reproduce it over here.

00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:52.684
And here's the delta
x, here's delta x.

00:44:52.684 --> 00:44:54.350
And of course there
are various heights.

00:44:54.350 --> 00:44:57.020
This starts out at
y_0, this is y_2,

00:44:57.020 --> 00:45:03.490
and this middle segment is y_1.

00:45:03.490 --> 00:45:08.200
Now, the approximating curve
that we're going to use

00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:14.690
is a parabola.

00:45:14.690 --> 00:45:17.400
That is, we're going to fit a
parabola through these three

00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:25.240
points.

00:45:25.240 --> 00:45:28.500
And then we're going to use
that as the approximating area.

00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:32.360
Now, it doesn't look like--
This looks like it misses.

00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:34.262
But actually, most
functions mostly

00:45:34.262 --> 00:45:35.720
wiggle either one
way or the other.

00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:36.490
They don't switch.

00:45:36.490 --> 00:45:38.800
They don't have
inflection points.

00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:41.320
So, this is a lousy,
at this scale.

00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:42.890
But when we get to
a smaller scale,

00:45:42.890 --> 00:45:45.110
this becomes really fantastic.

00:45:45.110 --> 00:45:47.430
As an approximation.

00:45:47.430 --> 00:45:52.400
Now, I need to tell you
what the arithmetic is.

00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:56.980
And in order to save
time, it's on your problem

00:45:56.980 --> 00:46:00.080
set what the actual formula is.

00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:05.440
But I'm going to tell you
how to think about it.

00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:09.530
I want you to think
about it as follows.

00:46:09.530 --> 00:46:20.530
So the area under
the parabola is

00:46:20.530 --> 00:46:30.800
going to be a base times
some kind of average height.

00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:33.770
And the base here,
you can already see.

00:46:33.770 --> 00:46:36.020
It's 2 delta x.

00:46:36.020 --> 00:46:39.430
The base is 2 delta x.

00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:40.920
Now, the average
height is weird.

00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:43.070
You have to work out what
it is for a parabola,

00:46:43.070 --> 00:46:46.420
depending on those three
numbers, y_0, y_1, and y_2.

00:46:46.420 --> 00:46:48.760
And it turns out to be
the following formula.

00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:50.440
It has to be an
average, but it's

00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:51.910
an interesting weighted average.

00:46:51.910 --> 00:46:53.587
So this was the
punchline, if you like.

00:46:53.587 --> 00:46:56.170
Is that they are such things as
interesting weighted averages.

00:46:56.170 --> 00:46:58.680
This one's very simple, it
just involves three numbers.

00:46:58.680 --> 00:46:59.980
But it's still interesting.

00:46:59.980 --> 00:47:00.771
It's the following.

00:47:00.771 --> 00:47:07.260
It turns out to be
(y_0 + 4y_1 + y_2) / 6.

00:47:07.260 --> 00:47:08.160
Why divided by 6?

00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:10.730
Well, it's supposed
to be an average.

00:47:10.730 --> 00:47:13.640
So the total is 1 + 4
+ 1 of these things.

00:47:13.640 --> 00:47:16.090
And 6 is in the denominator.

00:47:16.090 --> 00:47:19.790
So it emphasizes the
middle more than the sides.

00:47:19.790 --> 00:47:23.440
And that's what happens
with a parabola.

00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:30.580
So this is a computation
which is on your homework.

00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:34.440
And now we can put this together
for the full Simpson's Rule

00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:36.190
formula.

00:47:36.190 --> 00:47:51.770
Which I'll put up over here.

00:47:51.770 --> 00:47:56.350
We have here 2 delta
x, and we divide by 6.

00:47:56.350 --> 00:48:03.470
And then we have (y_0 +
4y_1 + y_2) / 6 plus--

00:48:03.470 --> 00:48:05.390
That's the first chunk.

00:48:05.390 --> 00:48:09.130
Now, the second chunk, maybe
I'll just put it in here,

00:48:09.130 --> 00:48:11.820
starts-- This is x_2.

00:48:11.820 --> 00:48:14.050
This is x_0.

00:48:14.050 --> 00:48:15.620
And it goes all the way to x_4.

00:48:15.620 --> 00:48:18.800
So x_2, x_3, x_4.

00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:21.920
So the next one involves
the indices 2, 3 and 4.

00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:31.580
So this is (y_2 +
4y_3 + y_4) / 6.

00:48:31.580 --> 00:48:34.454
Oh, oh, oh, oh, no.

00:48:34.454 --> 00:48:35.870
I think I'll get
rid of these 6's.

00:48:35.870 --> 00:48:37.990
I have too many 6's.

00:48:37.990 --> 00:48:39.850
Alright.

00:48:39.850 --> 00:48:41.057
Let's get rid of them here.

00:48:41.057 --> 00:48:41.890
Let's take them out.

00:48:41.890 --> 00:48:44.040
Put them out here.

00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:47.870
Thank you.

00:48:47.870 --> 00:48:51.650
All the way to the end, which is
y_(n-2) plus 2y_(n-1)-- sorry,

00:48:51.650 --> 00:48:53.810
plus 4y_(n-1) plus y_n.

00:48:57.050 --> 00:49:01.580
I was about to divide
by 6, but you saved me.

00:49:01.580 --> 00:49:04.350
So here are all the chunks.

00:49:04.350 --> 00:49:06.960
Now, what does this
pattern come out to be?

00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:10.740
This comes out to
be the following.

00:49:10.740 --> 00:49:16.950
This is 1, 4, 1, added to
1, 4, 1 added to 1, 4, 1.

00:49:16.950 --> 00:49:17.760
You add them up.

00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:22.140
You get 1, 4, and then there's a
repeat, so you get a 2 and a 4,

00:49:22.140 --> 00:49:24.170
and a 2 and a 4 and a 1.

00:49:24.170 --> 00:49:29.250
So the pattern is that it starts
out with 1's on the far ends.

00:49:29.250 --> 00:49:30.910
And then 4's next in.

00:49:30.910 --> 00:49:35.230
And then it alternates
2's and 4's in between.

00:49:35.230 --> 00:49:45.440
So the full pattern of
Simpson's Rule is delta x / 3,

00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:48.720
I have now succeeded in
canceling this 2 with this 6

00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:50.740
and getting out
that factor of 2.

00:49:50.740 --> 00:50:00.966
And then here I have y0 +
4 y1 + 2 y2 + 4 y3 + ...

00:50:00.966 --> 00:50:03.520
It keeps on going and keeps
on going and keeps on going.

00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:10.820
And in the end it's 2 y_(n
- 2) + 4 y_(n - 1) + y_n.

00:50:10.820 --> 00:50:14.860
So again, 1 and a 4 to start.

00:50:14.860 --> 00:50:16.410
4 and a 1 to end.

00:50:16.410 --> 00:50:20.170
And then alternating 2's
and 4's in the middle.

00:50:20.170 --> 00:50:25.650
And this weird weighted
average is way better.

00:50:25.650 --> 00:50:28.890
As I will show you next time.
