00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.560
PROFESSOR: So we're
going to continue

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.420
to talk about trig integrals
and trig substitutions.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.520
This is maybe the
most technical part

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.560
of this course, which maybe is
why professor Jerison decided

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.520
to just take a leave, go AWOL
just now and let me take over

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:38.610
for him.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.960
But I'll do my best to help
you learn this technique

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.680
and it'll be useful for you.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.880
So we've talked about
trig integrals involving

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.460
sines and cosines yesterday.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.060
There's another
whole world out there

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:58.850
that involves these other trig
polynomials-- trig functions,

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.520
secant and tangent.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.460
Let me just make a little table
to remind you what they are.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.210
Because I have trouble
remembering myself,

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.630
so I enjoy the
opportunity to go back

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.321
to remind myself of this stuff.

00:01:09.321 --> 00:01:09.820
Let's see.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.860
The secant is one over one of
those things, which one is it?

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.420
It's weird, it's
1 over the cosine.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.710
And the cosecant
is 1 over the sin.

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.800
Of course the tangent, we know.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.840
It's the sine over the
cosine and the cotangent

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.000
is the other way around.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.700
So when you put a
"co" in front of it,

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.590
it exchanges sine and cosine.

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.840
Well, I have a few identities
involving tangent and secant

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.270
up there, in that little
prepared blackboard up above.

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.680
Maybe I'll just go
through and check that out

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.604
to make sure that we're all
on the same page with them.

00:01:57.604 --> 00:01:59.020
So I'm going to
claim that there's

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.560
this trig identity at the top.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:07.310
Secant squared is
1 plus the tangent.

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.590
So let's just check that out.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.670
So the secant is
1 over the cosine,

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.890
so secant squared is
1 over cosine squared.

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.100
And then whenever you
see a 1 in trigonometry,

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:23.010
you'll always have the option
of writing as cos^2 + sin^2.

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.210
And if I do that, then I can
divide the cos^2 into that

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.300
first term.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.380
And I get 1 + sin^2 / cos^2.

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:37.940
/ ^2.

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.430
Which is the tangent squared.

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.180
So there you go.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.820
That checks the first one.

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.320
That's the main
trig identity that's

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.330
going to be behind what
I talk about today.

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.460
That's the trigonometry
identity part.

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.040
How about this
piece of calculus.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:05.490
Can we calculate what the
derivative of tan x is?

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:12.350
Actually, I'm going to
do that on this board.

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:19.110
So tan x = sin x / cos x.

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.250
So I think I was with
you when we learned

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.500
about the quotient rule.

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.030
Computing the derivative
of a quotient.

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.340
And the rule is, you
take the numerator

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.330
and you-- sorry, you take the
derivative of the numerator,

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.510
which is cosine.

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.570
And you multiply it
by the denominator,

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.590
so that gives you cos^2.

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.480
And then you take the numerator,
take minus the numerator,

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.400
and multiply that by the
derivative of the denominator,

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.240
which is -sin x.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:57.870
And you put all that over the
square of the denominator.

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.490
And now I look at that and
before my eyes I see the same

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:07.420
trig identity, cos^2 +
sin^2 = 1, appearing there.

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:13.850
This is 1 / cos^2(x)
which is secant squared.

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:15.022
And, good.

00:04:15.022 --> 00:04:16.230
So that's what the claim was.

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:20.420
The derivative of the tangent
is the secant squared.

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:22.260
That immediately
gives you an integral.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.240
Namely, the integral of
secant squared is the tangent.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.510
That's the fundamental
theorem of calculus.

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.360
So we verified the
first integral there.

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.490
Well, let's just do
the second one as well.

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:40.280
So if I want to
differentiate the secant,

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.360
derivative of the secant.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:46.500
So that's d/dx of
1 over the cosine.

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:47.817
And again, I have a quotient.

00:04:47.817 --> 00:04:49.900
This one's a little easier
because the numerator's

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.010
so simple.

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.310
So I take the derivative of
the numerator, which is 0.

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.580
And then I take the
numerator, I take

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.830
minus the numerator times the
derivative of the denominator.

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:05.610
Which is -sin x,
and put all that

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.900
over the square of
the same denominator.

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.809
So one minus sign came
from the quotient rule,

00:05:12.809 --> 00:05:14.350
and the other one
came because that's

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.580
the derivative of the cosine.

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:21.010
But they cancel, and
so I get sin / cos^2,

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:25.640
which is sin / cos times 1 /
cos and so that's the secant,

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:32.160
that's 1 / cos, times tan x.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.190
So, not hard.

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:36.300
That verifies that the
derivative of secant

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:37.990
is secant tangent.

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:41.800
And it tells you that the
integral of that weird thing

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.830
in case you ever want
to know, the integral

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:47.910
of the secant tangent
is the secant.

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:50.470
Well, there are a
couple more integrals

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:54.000
that I want to do for you.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.050
Where I can't sort of
work backwards like that.

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:07.060
Let's calculate the
integral of the tangent.

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:09.380
Just do this straight out.

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:22.610
So the tangent is the sine
divided by the cosine.

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:28.520
And now there's a habit of
mind, that I hope you get into.

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:33.310
When you see the cosine and
you're calculating an integral

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:35.950
like this, it's
useful to remember

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:37.700
what the derivative
of the cosine is.

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:41.420
Because maybe it shows up
somewhere else in the integral.

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:43.540
And that happens here.

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:50.300
So that suggests we make
a substitution. u = cos x.

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:55.620
Which means du = -sin x dx.

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:59.020
That's the numerator,
except for the minus sign.

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:08.570
And so I can rewrite this
as, under the substitution,

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:13.120
I can rewrite this as
-du, that's the numerator,

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:19.600
sin x dx is -du, divided by u.

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:22.150
Well, I know how to
do that integral too.

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:24.210
That gives me the
natural log, doesn't it.

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:31.150
So this is -ln(u)
plus a constant.

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:32.360
I'm not quite done.

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.750
I have to back-substitute
and replace

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:39.080
this new variable that I've made
up, called u, with what it is.

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:46.760
And what you get is -ln(cos x).

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:50.410
So the integral of the
tangent is minus log cosine.

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:55.590
Now, you find these
tables of integrals

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:56.910
in the back of the book.

00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:58.320
Things like that.

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:01.060
I'm not sure how much
memorization Professor Jerison

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:04.210
is going to ask
of you, but there

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:05.770
is a certain amount
of memorization

00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:06.937
that goes on in calculus.

00:08:06.937 --> 00:08:08.520
And this is one of
the kinds of things

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:12.380
that you probably want to know.

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:15.450
Let me do one more integral.

00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:18.100
I think I'm making my way
through a prepared board here,

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:20.350
let's see.

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:23.060
Good.

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:28.940
So the integral of the
tangent is minus log cosine.

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:36.090
I'd also like to know what the
integral of the secant of x is.

00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:41.280
And I don't know a way to
kind of go straight at this,

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:45.580
but let me show you a way to
think your way through to it.

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:52.720
If I take these two facts,
tangent prime is what it is,

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:56.280
and secant prime is what it
is, and add them together,

00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:57.420
I get this fact.

00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:05.400
That the derivative of
the sec x + tan x is,

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:08.350
well, it's the sum
of these two things.

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:11.060
Secant squared plus
secant tangent.

00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:15.180
And there's a secant that
occurs in both of those terms.

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:17.140
So I'll factor it out.

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:21.440
And that gives me,
I'll put it over here.

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:24.516
There's the secant of x
that occurs in both terms.

00:09:24.516 --> 00:09:26.390
And then in one term,
there's another secant.

00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:32.740
And in the other term,
there's a tangent.

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:36.970
So that's interesting somehow,
because this same term appears

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:40.200
on both sides of this equation.

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:49.160
Let's write u, for
that sec x + tan x.

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:55.120
And so the equation that
I get is u' = u sec x.

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:03.860
I've just made a
direct substitution.

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:05.620
Just decide that
I'm going to write u

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:07.730
for that single
thing that occurs

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:09.600
on both sides of the equation.

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:16.440
So u' is on the left, and
u * sec x is on the right.

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:18.560
Well, there's my secant.

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:20.210
That I was trying to integrate.

00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:28.560
And what it tells
you is that = u' / u.

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:35.550
Just divide both sides by u,
and I get this equation. u' / u,

00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:36.910
that has a name.

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:38.880
Not sure that
professor Jerison's

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:41.604
used this in this
class, but u' / u,

00:10:41.604 --> 00:10:43.270
we've actually used
something like that.

00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:45.560
It's on the board right now.

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:47.650
It's a logarithmic derivative.

00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:57.750
It is the derivative of the
national logarithm of u.

00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:59.940
Maybe it's easier to read
this from right to left,

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:02.780
if I want to calculate the
derivative of the logarithm,

00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:06.380
well, the chain rule says I
get the derivative of u times

00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:11.100
the derivative of the log
function, which is 1 / u.

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:25.964
So often u' / u is called
the logarithmic derivative.

00:11:25.964 --> 00:11:27.130
But it's done what I wanted.

00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:31.740
Because it's expressed the
secant as a derivative.

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:38.630
And I guess I should
put in what u is.

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:46.090
It's the secant
plus the tangent.

00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:48.500
And so that implies
that the integral--

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:49.510
Integrate both sides.

00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:56.840
That says that the integral of
sec x dx, is ln(sec x + tan x).

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:09.500
So that's the last line in this
little memo that I created.

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:14.500
That we can use now for
the rest of the class.

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:19.320
Any questions about that trick?

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:23.740
It's a trick, I have nothing
more to say about it.

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:24.540
OK.

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:30.210
So, the next thing
I-- oh yes, so now

00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:33.060
I want to make the point
that using these rules

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:38.350
and some thought,
you can now integrate

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:41.650
most trigonometric polynomials.

00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:44.850
Most things that involve
powers of sines and cosines

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:48.080
and tangents and secants
and everything else.

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:56.790
For example, let's try to
integrate the integral of sec^4

00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:59.180
x.

00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:01.914
Big power of the
secant function.

00:13:01.914 --> 00:13:03.830
Well, there are too many
secants there for me.

00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:05.680
So let's take some away.

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:09.730
And I can take them away by
using that trig identity,

00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:12.300
sec^2 = 1 + tan^2.

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:16.680
So I'm going to replace two
of those secants by 1 + tan^2.

00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:25.190
That leaves me
with two left over.

00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:27.920
Now there was method
to my madness.

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:31.020
Because I've got a secant
squared left over there.

00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:35.280
And secant squared is the
derivative of tangent.

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:40.970
So that suggests a substitution.

00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:48.440
Namely, let's say, let's let u =
tan x, so that du = sec^2 x dx.

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:55.700
And I have both terms
that occur in my integral

00:13:55.700 --> 00:14:01.800
sitting there very nicely.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:05.020
So this is the possibility
of making this substitution

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:08.240
and seeing a secant
squared up here as part

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:10.330
of the differential here.

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:13.910
That's why it was a good
idea for me to take two

00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:16.350
of the secants and
write them as 1 + tan^2.

00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:22.250
So now I can continue this.

00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:25.780
Under that
substitution, I get 1.

00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:32.810
Oh yeah, and I should add
the other fact, that--

00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:38.460
Well I guess it's obvious
that tangent squared is u^2.

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:41.070
So I get 1 + u^2.

00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:50.110
And then du-- sec^2
sec^2 x dx, that is du.

00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:52.430
Well that's pretty
easy to integrate.

00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:56.690
So I get u + u^3 / 3.

00:14:56.690 --> 00:14:57.950
Plus a constant.

00:14:57.950 --> 00:15:00.020
And then I just have
to back-substitute.

00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:03.600
Put things back in terms
of the original variables.

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:12.220
And that gives me tan x
plus tangent cubed over 3.

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:15.610
And there's the answer.

00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:17.070
So we could spend
a lot more time

00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:21.810
doing more examples of this
kind of polynomial trig thing.

00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:27.440
It's probably best for you to
do some practice on your own.

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:30.020
Because I want to talk
about other things, also.

00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:32.800
And what I want to
talk about is the use

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:39.380
of these trig identities in
making really trig substitution

00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:51.590
integration.

00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:54.320
So we did a little
bit of this yesterday,

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:56.990
and I'll show you some
more examples today.

00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:59.520
Let's start with a pretty hard
example right off the bat.

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:07.700
So this is going to be the
integral of dx over x^2 times

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:10.200
the square root of 1+x^2.

00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:18.120
It's a pretty bad
looking integral.

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:20.190
So how can we approach this?

00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:25.390
Well, the square root is the
ugliest part of the integral,

00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:27.240
I think.

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:30.160
What we should try to do
is write this square root

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:31.600
in some nicer way.

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:37.180
That is, figure out a way
to write 1+x^2 as a square.

00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:40.140
That'll get rid of
the square root.

00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:44.540
So there is an example of a
way to write 1 plus something

00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:46.140
squared in a different way.

00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:47.760
And it's right up there.

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:50.790
sec^2 = 1 + tan^2.

00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:53.450
So I want to use that idea.

00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:56.650
And when I see this
form, that suggests

00:16:56.650 --> 00:16:59.520
that we make a trig
substitution and write

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:04.682
x as the tangent of
some new variable.

00:17:04.682 --> 00:17:06.140
Which you might as
well call theta,

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:09.060
to because it's like an angle.

00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:15.960
Then 1+x^2 is the
secant squared.

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:18.620
According to that trig identity.

00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:23.970
And so the square root
of 1+x^2 is sec(theta).

00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:31.070
Right?

00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:36.220
So this identity is the
reason that the substitution

00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:37.120
is going to help us.

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:39.430
Because it gets rid
of the square root

00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:43.550
and replaces it by some
other trig function.

00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:46.080
I'd better be able to
get rid of the dx, too.

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:48.520
That's part of the
substitution process.

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:50.520
But we can do that,
because I know

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:52.440
what the derivative
of the tangent is.

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:56.070
It's secant squared.

00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:58.880
So dx / d theta is sec^2(theta).

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:01.150
So dx is sec^2(theta) d theta.

00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:07.350
So let's just substitute
all of that stuff

00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:10.280
in, and rewrite the
entire integral in terms

00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:11.750
of our new variable, theta.

00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:14.570
So dx is in the numerator.

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:18.210
That's sec^2(theta) d theta.

00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:21.197
And then the denominator,
well, it has an x^2.

00:18:21.197 --> 00:18:22.030
That's tan^2(theta).

00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:28.660
And then there's
this square root.

00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:31.690
And we know what that
is in terms of theta.

00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:32.730
It's sec(theta).

00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:41.920
OK, now. we've done
the trig substitution.

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:43.940
I've gotten rid of
the square root,

00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:46.050
I've got everything in
terms of trig functions

00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:48.020
of the new variable.

00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:49.860
Pretty complicated
trig function.

00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:52.550
This often happens, you wind
up with a complete scattering

00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:55.050
of different trig functions in
the numerator and denominator

00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:56.250
and everything.

00:18:56.250 --> 00:18:58.950
A systematic thing to do
here is to put everything

00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:09.110
in terms of sines and cosines.

00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:12.600
Unless you can see right away,
how it's going to simplify,

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:15.010
the systematic thing
to do is to rewrite

00:19:15.010 --> 00:19:17.110
in terms of sines and cosines.

00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:19.300
So let's do that.

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:20.260
So let's see.

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:23.520
The secant squared,
secant is 1 over cosine.

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:28.920
So I'm going to put a cosine
squared in the denominator.

00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:32.070
Oh, I guess the first
thing I can do is cancel.

00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:33.270
Let's do that.

00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:34.200
That's clever.

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:35.700
You were all thinking that too.

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:37.220
Cancel those.

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:39.860
So now I just get one
cosine denominator

00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:44.382
from the secant there
in the numerator.

00:19:44.382 --> 00:19:46.840
It's still pretty complicated,
secant over tangent squared,

00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:48.110
who knows.

00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:49.410
Well, we'll find out.

00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:52.450
Because the tangent
is sine over cosine.

00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:55.940
So I should put a sine
squared where the tangent was,

00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:59.330
and a cosine squared up there.

00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:02.180
And I still have d theta.

00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:04.300
And now you see some
more cancellation occurs.

00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:07.950
That's the virtue of writing
things out in this way.

00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:14.940
So now, the square here
cancels with this cosine.

00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:20.580
And I'm left with cos(theta)
d theta / sin^2(theta).

00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:26.860
That's a little simpler.

00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:33.300
And it puts me in a position to
use the same idea I just used.

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:35.100
I see the sine here.

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:37.090
I might look around
in this integral

00:20:37.090 --> 00:20:39.940
to see if its derivative
occurs anywhere.

00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:43.890
The differential of
the sine is the cosine.

00:20:43.890 --> 00:20:49.720
And so I'm very much inclined
to make another substitution.

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:54.250
Say, u, direct
substitution this time.

00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:56.150
And say u is the
cosine of theta.

00:20:56.150 --> 00:20:59.110
Because then du-- Oh, I'm sorry.

00:20:59.110 --> 00:21:01.850
Say, u is the sine of theta.

00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:05.980
Because then du is
cos(theta) d theta.

00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:20.140
And then this integral becomes,
well, the numerator just is du.

00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:22.660
The denominator is u^2.

00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:25.550
And I think we can
break out the champagne,

00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:28.169
because we can
integrate that one.

00:21:28.169 --> 00:21:29.710
Finally get rid of
the integral sign.

00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:30.210
Yes sir.

00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:37.842
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:37.842 --> 00:21:40.300
PROFESSOR: OK, how do I know
to make u equal to sine rather

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:41.640
than cosine.

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:45.540
Because I want to see
du appear up here.

00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:49.360
If I'd had a sine up here,
that would be a signal to me

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:53.510
that maybe I should say
let u be the cosine.

00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:54.280
OK?

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:56.980
Also, because this thing in
the denominator is something

00:21:56.980 --> 00:21:57.870
I want to get rid of.

00:21:57.870 --> 00:21:59.050
It's in the denominator.

00:21:59.050 --> 00:22:01.030
So I'll get rid of it
by wishful thinking

00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:04.940
and just call it something else.

00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:07.010
It works pretty
well in this case.

00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:10.400
Wishful thinking doesn't
always work so well.

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:18.510
So I integrate u^(-2) du, and
I get - -1/u plus a constant,

00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:21.340
and I'm done with the
calculus part of this problem.

00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:22.580
I've done the integral now.

00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:25.736
Gotten rid of the integral sign.

00:22:25.736 --> 00:22:27.360
But I'm not quite
done with the problem

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:29.640
yet, because I have
to work my way back

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:31.320
through two substitutions.

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:33.120
First, this one.

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:34.620
And then this one.

00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:38.800
So this first substitution isn't
so bad to get rid of, to undo,

00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:40.200
to back-substitute.

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:43.630
Because u is just sin(theta).

00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:46.740
And so 1/u is, I
guess a fancy way

00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:52.540
to write it is the
cosecant of theta.

00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:54.890
1 over the sine is the cosecant.

00:22:54.890 --> 00:23:00.257
So I get -csc(theta)
plus a constant.

00:23:00.257 --> 00:23:01.590
Is there a question in the back?

00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:02.090
Yes sir?

00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:07.010
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:07.010 --> 00:23:09.000
PROFESSOR: I'm sorry,
my hearing is so bad.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.500
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:16.070
PROFESSOR: How did I
know this substitution

00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:19.950
in the first place.

00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:22.510
It's because of the 1 + x^2.

00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:24.510
And I want to make use
of the trig identity

00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:26.380
in the upper left-hand corner.

00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:29.430
I'll make you a table in a
few minutes that will put

00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:30.870
all this in a bigger context.

00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:32.350
And I think it'll help you then.

00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:35.880
OK, I'll promise.

00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:39.570
So, what I want to try
to talk about right

00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:43.710
now is how to rewrite
a term like this.

00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:47.240
A trig term like this,
back in terms of x.

00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:51.020
So I want to undo this
trick substitution.

00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:55.190
This is a trig sub.

00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:59.350
And what I want to do now is
try to undo that trig sub.

00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:00.970
And I'll show you
a general method

00:24:00.970 --> 00:24:03.210
for undoing trig substitutions.

00:24:03.210 --> 00:24:05.100
This happens quite often.

00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:07.150
I don't know what the
cosecant of theta is.

00:24:07.150 --> 00:24:11.290
But I do know what the
tangent of theta is.

00:24:11.290 --> 00:24:14.060
So I want to make a
relation between them.

00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:20.920
OK, so undoing.

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:24.420
Trig subs.

00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:29.420
So let's go back to where
trigonometry always comes from,

00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:32.130
this right angled triangle.

00:24:32.130 --> 00:24:35.540
The theta in the corner,
and then these three sides.

00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:37.590
This one's called
the hypotenuse.

00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:41.430
This one is called
the adjacent side,

00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:45.690
and that one's called
the opposite side.

00:24:45.690 --> 00:24:52.040
And now, let's find out where
x lies in this triangle.

00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:55.500
Let's try to write the sides
of this triangle in terms of x.

00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:58.670
And what I know is, x
is the tangent of theta.

00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:01.310
So the tangent of theta,
tangent of this angle,

00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:03.830
is opposite divided by adjacent.

00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:05.890
Did you learn SOH CAH TOA?

00:25:05.890 --> 00:25:09.520
OK, so it's opposite
divided by adjacent.

00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:10.580
Is the tangent.

00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:13.650
So there are different
ways to do that,

00:25:13.650 --> 00:25:15.530
but why not just do
it in the simplest way

00:25:15.530 --> 00:25:21.950
and suppose that the adjacent
is 1, and the opposite is x.

00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:24.530
This is correct now, isn't it?

00:25:24.530 --> 00:25:27.890
I get the correct value
for the tangent of theta

00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:32.910
by saying that the lengths
of those are 1 and x.

00:25:32.910 --> 00:25:39.160
And that means that the
hypotenuse has length 1 + x^2.

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:40.840
Well, here's a triangle.

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:44.060
I'm interested in computing
the cosecant of theta.

00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:50.840
Where's that appear
in the triangle?

00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:51.510
Well, let's see.

00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:55.570
The cosecant of theta
is 1 over the sine.

00:25:55.570 --> 00:26:02.830
And the sine is opposite
over hypotenuse.

00:26:02.830 --> 00:26:15.240
So the cosecant is
hypotenuse over opposite.

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:20.680
And the hypotenuse is the
square root of 1 + x^2,

00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:24.680
and the opposite is x.

00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:26.200
And so I've done it.

00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:29.650
I've undone the
trig substitution.

00:26:29.650 --> 00:26:32.100
I've figured out what
this cosecant of theta

00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:35.360
is, in terms of x.

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:39.490
And so the final answer is
minus the square root of 1+x^2,

00:26:39.490 --> 00:26:43.470
over x, plus a constant,
and there's an answer

00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:53.030
to the original problem.

00:26:53.030 --> 00:26:57.160
This took two boards
to go through this.

00:26:57.160 --> 00:27:00.800
I illustrated several things.

00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:02.870
Actually, this
three half boards.

00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:05.190
I illustrated this use
of trig substitution,

00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:07.910
and I'll come back
to that in a second.

00:27:07.910 --> 00:27:10.870
I illustrated patience.

00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:15.320
I illustrated rewriting things
in terms of sines and cosines,

00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:17.080
and then making a
direct substitution

00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:19.550
to evaluate an
integral like this.

00:27:19.550 --> 00:27:23.520
And then there's this undoing
all of those substitutions.

00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:25.670
And it culminated with
undoing the trig sub.

00:27:25.670 --> 00:27:31.100
So let's play a game here.

00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:35.070
Why don't we play
the game where you

00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:46.970
give me-- So, there's a step in
here that I should have done.

00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:56.390
I should've said this is
-cos(arctan(theta)) plus

00:27:56.390 --> 00:27:58.812
a constant.

00:27:58.812 --> 00:28:00.520
The most straightforward
thing you can do

00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:02.760
is to say since x is
the tangent of theta,

00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:06.950
that means that-- sorry,
if x, that means that theta

00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:08.970
is the arctangent of x.

00:28:08.970 --> 00:28:11.761
And so let's just put in
theta as the arctangent of x,

00:28:11.761 --> 00:28:12.760
and that's what you get.

00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:15.020
So really, what I
just did for you

00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:19.720
was to show you a way to compute
some trig function applied

00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:23.900
to the inverse of
another trig function.

00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:29.860
I computed cosecant of the
arctangent by this trick.

00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:32.260
So now, let's play the
game where you give me

00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:35.150
a trig function and an
inverse trig function,

00:28:35.150 --> 00:28:46.950
and I try to compute
what the composite is.

00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:47.510
OK.

00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:58.530
So who can give me
a trig function.

00:28:58.530 --> 00:29:03.310
Has to be one of
these standard ones.

00:29:03.310 --> 00:29:03.900
STUDENT: Tan.

00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:04.870
PROFESSOR: Tangent.

00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:07.034
Alright.

00:29:07.034 --> 00:29:07.950
How about another one?

00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:11.120
STUDENT: Sine.

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:12.350
PROFESSOR: Sine.

00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:15.180
Do we have agreement on sine.

00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:16.910
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:16.910 --> 00:29:17.760
PROFESSOR: Secant?

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:27.802
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:27.802 --> 00:29:29.510
PROFESSOR: Right, csc
has the best cheer.

00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:30.301
So that's the game.

00:29:30.301 --> 00:29:34.867
We have to compute, try to
compute, that composite.

00:29:34.867 --> 00:29:35.950
Something wrong with this?

00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:45.459
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:45.459 --> 00:29:47.000
PROFESSOR: What does
acceptable mean?

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.810
Don't you think--
so the question is,

00:29:48.810 --> 00:29:51.900
isn't this a perfectly
acceptable final answer.

00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:53.760
It's a correct final answer.

00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:56.850
But this is much
more insightful.

00:29:56.850 --> 00:30:00.919
And after all the original
thing was involving square roots

00:30:00.919 --> 00:30:02.460
and things, this is
the kind of thing

00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:03.920
you might hope for is an answer.

00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:07.720
This is just a nicer
answer for sure.

00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:10.210
And likely to be more
useful to you when you go on

00:30:10.210 --> 00:30:13.830
and use that answer
for something else.

00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:18.610
OK, so let's try
to do this this.

00:30:18.610 --> 00:30:22.260
Undo a trig substitution
that involved a cosecant.

00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:23.910
And I manipulate
around, and I find

00:30:23.910 --> 00:30:27.540
myself trying to find out
what's the tangent of theta.

00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:29.240
So here's how we go about it.

00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:33.970
I draw this triangle.

00:30:33.970 --> 00:30:37.590
Theta is the angle here.

00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:43.570
This is the adjacent,
opposite, hypotenuse.

00:30:43.570 --> 00:30:49.030
So, the first thing is how can
I make the cosecant appear here,

00:30:49.030 --> 00:30:49.950
csc x.

00:30:49.950 --> 00:30:52.640
What dimensions should I
give to the sides in order

00:30:52.640 --> 00:31:01.400
for the cosecant of x,
sorry, in order for theta

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:02.880
to be the cosecant of x.

00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:05.280
This thing is theta.

00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:17.810
So, that means that
the cosecant of x--

00:31:17.810 --> 00:31:24.830
that means the cosecant
of theta should be x.

00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:28.970
Theta is the arccosecant, so
x is the cosecant of theta.

00:31:28.970 --> 00:31:31.980
So, what'll I take the sides
to be, to get the cosecant?

00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:37.050
The cosecant is 1 over the sine.

00:31:37.050 --> 00:31:47.960
And the sine is the opposite
over the hypotenuse.

00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:49.910
So I get hypotenuse
over opposite.

00:31:49.910 --> 00:31:53.750
And that's supposed
to be what x is.

00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:56.540
So I could make the
opposite anything

00:31:56.540 --> 00:31:59.190
I want, but the simplest
thing is to make it 1.

00:31:59.190 --> 00:32:00.080
Let's do that.

00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:04.300
And then what does that mean
about the rest of the sides?

00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:06.142
Hypotenuse had better be x.

00:32:06.142 --> 00:32:07.350
And then I've recovered this.

00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:12.350
So here's a triangle that
exhibits the correct angle.

00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:14.680
This remaining side is
going to be useful to us.

00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:20.550
And it is the square
root of x^2 - 1.

00:32:20.550 --> 00:32:24.060
So I've got a triangle of
the correct angle theta,

00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:27.400
and now I want to compute
the tangent of that angle.

00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:28.350
Well, that's easy.

00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:31.020
That's opposite
divided by adjacent.

00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:34.690
So I get 1 over the
square root of x^2 - 1.

00:32:38.270 --> 00:32:40.590
Very flexible tool
that'll be useful to you

00:32:40.590 --> 00:32:42.200
in many different times.

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:44.170
Whenever you have to
undo a trig substitution,

00:32:44.170 --> 00:32:49.100
this is likely to be useful.

00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:51.740
OK, that was a good game.

00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:52.740
No winners in this game.

00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:53.700
We're all winners.

00:32:53.700 --> 00:33:01.970
No losers, we're all winners.

00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:02.740
OK.

00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:06.340
So, good.

00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:09.810
So let me make this table of the
different trig substitutions,

00:33:09.810 --> 00:33:11.010
and how they can be useful.

00:33:11.010 --> 00:33:20.520
Summary of trig substitutions.

00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:28.540
So over here, we
have, if you see,

00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:58.090
so if your integrand contains,
make a substitution to get.

00:33:58.090 --> 00:34:01.086
So if your integrand
contains, I'll

00:34:01.086 --> 00:34:02.710
write these things
out as square roots.

00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:07.670
If it contains the
square root a^2 - x^2,

00:34:07.670 --> 00:34:10.560
this is what we talked
about on Thursday.

00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:14.470
When I was trying to find the
area of that piece of a circle.

00:34:14.470 --> 00:34:18.130
There, I suggested that we
should make the substitution

00:34:18.130 --> 00:34:20.260
x = a cos(theta).

00:34:22.890 --> 00:34:28.920
Or, x = a sin(theta).

00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:31.400
Either one works just as well.

00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:36.430
And there's no way to
prefer one over the other.

00:34:36.430 --> 00:34:41.110
And when you make the
substitution, x = a cos(theta),

00:34:41.110 --> 00:34:44.030
you get a^2 - a^2 cos^2(theta).

00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:45.340
theta.

00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:48.280
1 - cos^2 is sin^2.

00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:50.620
So you get a sin(theta).

00:34:55.270 --> 00:34:59.880
So this expression becomes
equal to this expression

00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:03.950
under that substitution.

00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:04.800
And then you go on.

00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:06.626
Then you've gotten rid
of the square root,

00:35:06.626 --> 00:35:08.250
and you've got a
trigonometric integral

00:35:08.250 --> 00:35:10.610
that you have to try to do.

00:35:10.610 --> 00:35:14.680
If you made the substitution a
sin(theta), you'd get a a^2 -

00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:21.580
a^2 sin^2, which
is a cos(theta).

00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:24.530
And then you can
go ahead as well.

00:35:24.530 --> 00:35:26.430
We just saw another example.

00:35:26.430 --> 00:35:29.510
Namely, if you have a^2 + x^2.

00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:35.530
That's like the example we had
up here. a = 1 in this example.

00:35:35.530 --> 00:35:36.510
What did we do?

00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:42.150
We tried the substitution
x = a tan(theta).

00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:44.910
And the reason is that I can
plug into the trig identity

00:35:44.910 --> 00:35:46.950
up here in the upper left.

00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:51.210
And replace a^2 +
x^2 by a sec(theta).

00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:59.790
Square root of the
secant squared.

00:35:59.790 --> 00:36:03.410
There's one more
thing in this table.

00:36:03.410 --> 00:36:06.520
Sort of, the only
remaining sum or difference

00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:07.544
of terms like this.

00:36:07.544 --> 00:36:09.460
And that's what happens
if you have x^2 - a^2.

00:36:14.050 --> 00:36:17.790
So there, I think we can make
a substitution a sec(theta).

00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:27.031
Because, after all,
sec^2(theta)-- so x^2 - a^2--

00:36:27.031 --> 00:36:27.530
Sorry.

00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:34.790
Let's see what happens when
I make that substitution.

00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:42.850
x^2 - a^2 = a^2
sec^2(theta) - a^2.

00:36:42.850 --> 00:36:45.460
Under this substitution.

00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:48.690
That's sec^2 - 1.

00:36:48.690 --> 00:36:51.390
Well, put the 1
on the other side.

00:36:51.390 --> 00:36:53.720
And you find tan^2, coming out.

00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:56.710
So this is a a^2 tan^2(theta).

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:02.680
And so that's what you
get, a times tan(theta).

00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:07.850
After I take the square
root, I get a tan(theta).

00:37:07.850 --> 00:37:13.080
So these are the three basic
trig substitution forms.

00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:15.580
Where trig substitutions
are useful to get

00:37:15.580 --> 00:37:17.920
rid of expressions like
this, and replace them

00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:22.670
by trigonometric expressions.

00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:25.140
And then you use this trick,
you do the integral if you can

00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:27.265
and then you use this trick
to get rid of the theta

00:37:27.265 --> 00:37:37.460
at the end.

00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:40.630
So now, the last thing I
want to talk about today

00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:59.180
is called completing the square.

00:37:59.180 --> 00:38:03.440
And that comes in
because unfortunately,

00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:08.350
not every square
root of a quadratic

00:38:08.350 --> 00:38:10.390
has such a simple form.

00:38:10.390 --> 00:38:16.200
You will often encounter
things that are not just

00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:18.080
the square root of
something simple.

00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:19.140
Like one of these forms.

00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:27.537
Like there might be a
middle term in there.

00:38:27.537 --> 00:38:29.120
I don't actually
have time to show you

00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:33.200
an example of how this comes out
in a sort of practical example.

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:35.760
But it does happen
quite frequently.

00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:38.580
And so I want to show you
how to deal with things

00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:40.550
like the following example.

00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:47.380
Let's try to integrate
dx over x^2 + 4x,

00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:55.090
the square root of x^2 + 4x.

00:38:55.090 --> 00:38:59.010
So there's a square root of
some square, some quadratic.

00:38:59.010 --> 00:39:02.010
It's very much
like this business.

00:39:02.010 --> 00:39:04.830
But it isn't of
any of these forms.

00:39:04.830 --> 00:39:06.360
And so what I want
to do is show you

00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:10.540
how to rewrite it in one of
those forms using substitution,

00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:11.120
again.

00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:14.520
All this is about substitution.

00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:26.100
So the game is to rewrite
quadratic as something

00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:30.950
like x plus something or other.

00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:32.470
Plus some other constant.

00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:35.690
So write it, try to write
it, in the form of a square

00:39:35.690 --> 00:39:42.340
plus or minus another constant.

00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:45.170
And then we'll go on from there.

00:39:45.170 --> 00:39:51.110
So let's do that in this
case. x^2, x^2 + 4x.

00:39:51.110 --> 00:39:53.390
Well, if you square
this form out,

00:39:53.390 --> 00:39:57.280
then the middle term
is going to be 2ax.

00:39:57.280 --> 00:40:00.920
So that, since I have
a middle term here,

00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:03.640
I pretty much know
what a has to be.

00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:08.220
The only choice in order to
get something like x^2 + 4x out

00:40:08.220 --> 00:40:11.440
of this, is to take a to be 2.

00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:16.950
Because then, this
is what you get.

00:40:16.950 --> 00:40:19.790
This isn't quite right yet, but
let's compute what I have here.

00:40:19.790 --> 00:40:24.490
x^2 + 4x, so far
so good, plus 4,

00:40:24.490 --> 00:40:26.190
and I don't have a plus 4 here.

00:40:26.190 --> 00:40:31.394
So I have to fix that
by subtracting 4.

00:40:31.394 --> 00:40:32.310
So that's what I mean.

00:40:32.310 --> 00:40:33.393
I've completed the square.

00:40:33.393 --> 00:40:38.370
The word for this process of
eliminating the middle term

00:40:38.370 --> 00:40:41.850
by using the square of
an expression like that.

00:40:41.850 --> 00:40:44.830
That's called
completing the square.

00:40:44.830 --> 00:40:48.010
And we can use that process
to compute this integral.

00:40:48.010 --> 00:40:51.040
So let's do that.

00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:54.170
So I can rewrite this integral,
rewrite this denominator

00:40:54.170 --> 00:41:00.100
like this.

00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:03.860
And then I'm going to try to use
one of these forms over here.

00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:07.900
So in order to get a
single variable there,

00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:12.500
instead of something
complicated like x + 2,

00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:15.090
I'm inclined to come up
with another variable name

00:41:15.090 --> 00:41:20.330
and write it equal, write x +
2 as that other variable name.

00:41:20.330 --> 00:41:29.950
So here's another little
direct substitution. u = x + 2.

00:41:29.950 --> 00:41:31.260
Figure out what du is.

00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:36.610
That's pretty easy.

00:41:36.610 --> 00:41:41.580
And then rewrite the
integral in those terms.

00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:44.880
So dx = du.

00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:47.270
And then in the
denominator I have,

00:41:47.270 --> 00:41:49.100
well, I have the
square root of that.

00:41:49.100 --> 00:41:55.100
Oh yeah, so I think as part of
this I'll write out what x^2 +

00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:56.550
4x is.

00:41:56.550 --> 00:41:59.520
The point is, it's
equal to u^2 - 4.

00:42:04.170 --> 00:42:06.540
x^2 + 4x = u^2 - 4.

00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:20.260
There's the data box containing
the substitution data.

00:42:20.260 --> 00:42:22.640
And so now I can put that in.

00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:24.960
I have x^2 + 4x there.

00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:31.330
In terms of u, that's u^2 - 4.

00:42:31.330 --> 00:42:33.690
Well, now I'm in a happier
position because I can look

00:42:33.690 --> 00:42:37.060
for u^2 - 4 for something
like that in my table here.

00:42:37.060 --> 00:42:40.430
And it actually sits down here.

00:42:40.430 --> 00:42:43.365
So except for the
use of the letter x

00:42:43.365 --> 00:42:45.470
here instead of u over there.

00:42:45.470 --> 00:42:47.510
That tells me what I want.

00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:55.100
So to handle this, what I should
use is a trig substitution.

00:42:55.100 --> 00:42:58.020
And the trig substitution
that's suggested is,

00:42:58.020 --> 00:43:03.870
according to the bottom
line with a = 2, so a^2 = 4.

00:43:03.870 --> 00:43:07.600
The suggestion is,
I should take x--

00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:13.909
But I'd better not use
the letter x any more.

00:43:13.909 --> 00:43:15.950
But I don't have a letter
x, I have the letter u.

00:43:15.950 --> 00:43:21.310
I should take u
equal to 2 secant.

00:43:21.310 --> 00:43:23.110
And then some letter
I haven't used before.

00:43:23.110 --> 00:43:28.820
And theta is available.

00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:30.560
This is a look-up table process.

00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:33.240
I see the square
root of u^2 - 4,

00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:35.250
I see that that's of this form.

00:43:35.250 --> 00:43:38.230
I'm instructed to make
this substitution.

00:43:38.230 --> 00:43:40.540
And that's what I just did.

00:43:40.540 --> 00:43:43.600
Let's see how it works out.

00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:47.690
So that means the du is 2, OK.

00:43:47.690 --> 00:43:50.480
What's the derivative
of the secant?

00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:52.660
Secant tangent.

00:43:52.660 --> 00:43:59.050
So du = 2 sec(theta) tan(theta).

00:43:59.050 --> 00:44:05.690
And u^2 - 4 is,
here's the payoff.

00:44:05.690 --> 00:44:07.170
I'm supposed to
be able to rewrite

00:44:07.170 --> 00:44:09.350
that in terms of the tangent.

00:44:09.350 --> 00:44:19.650
According to this. u u^2 - 4
is 4 secant squared minus 4.

00:44:19.650 --> 00:44:22.450
And secant squared minus
1 is tangent squared.

00:44:22.450 --> 00:44:24.400
So this is 4 tan^2(theta).

00:44:30.890 --> 00:44:36.807
Right, yeah?

00:44:36.807 --> 00:44:37.640
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:42.200
PROFESSOR: But I squared it.

00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:44.180
And now I'll square root it.

00:44:44.180 --> 00:44:50.650
And I'll get a 2 and this
tangent will go away.

00:44:50.650 --> 00:44:56.130
So there's my data box
for this substitution.

00:44:56.130 --> 00:45:15.560
And let's go on
to another board.

00:45:15.560 --> 00:45:20.980
So where I'm at is the integral
of du over the square root

00:45:20.980 --> 00:45:22.010
of u^2 - 4.

00:45:26.850 --> 00:45:30.060
And I have all the
data I need here

00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:33.090
to rewrite that
in terms of theta.

00:45:33.090 --> 00:45:38.170
So du = 2 sec(theta)
tan(theta) d theta.

00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:44.140
And the denominator
is 2 tan(theta).

00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:48.590
Ha.

00:45:48.590 --> 00:45:53.040
Well, so some very nice
simplification happens here.

00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:55.940
The 2's cancel.

00:45:55.940 --> 00:45:58.260
And the tangents cancel.

00:45:58.260 --> 00:46:01.900
And I'm left with trying to work
with the integral, sec(theta) d

00:46:01.900 --> 00:46:03.920
theta.

00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:06.610
And luckily enough at the
very beginning of the hour,

00:46:06.610 --> 00:46:08.480
I worked out how to
compute the integral

00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:09.885
of the secant of theta.

00:46:09.885 --> 00:46:11.670
And there it is.

00:46:11.670 --> 00:46:25.000
So this is ln(sec(theta) +
tan(theta)) plus a constant.

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.660
And we're done with
the calculus part.

00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:29.390
There's no more integral there.

00:46:29.390 --> 00:46:31.490
But I still am not quite
done with the problem,

00:46:31.490 --> 00:46:37.180
because again I have these two
substitutions to try to undo.

00:46:37.180 --> 00:46:40.220
So let's undo them one by one.

00:46:40.220 --> 00:46:42.240
Let's see.

00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:44.130
I have this trig
substitution here.

00:46:44.130 --> 00:46:47.210
And I could use my triangle
trick, if I need to.

00:46:47.210 --> 00:46:49.280
But maybe I don't need to.

00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:51.220
Let's see, do I know
what the secant of theta

00:46:51.220 --> 00:46:53.090
is in terms of u?

00:46:53.090 --> 00:46:54.620
Well, I do.

00:46:54.620 --> 00:46:55.730
So I get ln(u/2).

00:46:58.980 --> 00:47:01.740
Do I know what the
tangent is in terms of u?

00:47:01.740 --> 00:47:02.730
Well, I do.

00:47:02.730 --> 00:47:04.180
It's here.

00:47:04.180 --> 00:47:06.500
So I lucked out, in this case.

00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:09.930
And I don't have to go through
and use that triangle trick.

00:47:09.930 --> 00:47:15.700
So the tangent of theta is the
square root of u^2 - 4, over 2.

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:20.080
Good.

00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:24.220
So I've undone this
trig substitution.

00:47:24.220 --> 00:47:28.440
I'm not quite done yet because
my answer is involved with u.

00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:30.780
And what I wanted
originally was x.

00:47:30.780 --> 00:47:33.780
But this direct substitution
that I started with

00:47:33.780 --> 00:47:35.250
is really easy to deal with.

00:47:35.250 --> 00:47:39.780
I can just put x + 2
every time I see a u.

00:47:39.780 --> 00:47:45.590
So this is the natural logarithm
of (x+2)/2 plus the square

00:47:45.590 --> 00:47:46.090
root...

00:47:46.090 --> 00:47:51.330
What's going to happen when I
put x + 2 in place for u here?

00:47:51.330 --> 00:47:54.490
You know what you get.

00:47:54.490 --> 00:47:59.230
You get exactly what
we started with.

00:47:59.230 --> 00:48:00.260
Right?

00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:04.850
I put x + 2 in
place of the u here.

00:48:04.850 --> 00:48:13.210
I get x^2 + 4x.

00:48:13.210 --> 00:48:15.330
So I've gotten back
to a function purely

00:48:15.330 --> 00:48:21.200
in terms of x OK, that's
a good place to quit.

00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:24.840
Have a great little
one-day break.

00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:27.320
I guess this class doesn't
meet on Monday anyway.

00:48:27.320 --> 00:48:28.477
Bye.
