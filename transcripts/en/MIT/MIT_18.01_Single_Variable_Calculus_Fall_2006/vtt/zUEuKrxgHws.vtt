00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.900
PROFESSOR: Now, today I need
to get started by finishing up

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.480
what I did last time.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.560
Namely, talking about
numerical methods.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.680
And I want to just
carry out one example.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.660
And then I want to
fill in one loose end.

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:48.870
And then we'll talk
about the unit overall.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:01:01.720
We were talking, last time,
about numerical integration.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.580
I'm going to illustrate this
just with the simplest example

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.960
that I can.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:14.070
We're going to look at the
integral from 1 to 2 of dx / x.

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.720
Which we know
perfectly well already

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.310
is the log of x evaluated
between 1 and 2, which is ln 2

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.250
- ln 1.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.080
Which is just ln 2.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.750
Now, if you punch that
into your calculator,

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.610
you're going to get
something like this.

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:41.030
I hope I saved it here.

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.530
Yeah.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:53.250
It's about 0.693147.

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.150
That's more digits than we're
going to get in our discussion

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:56.650
here.

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:02.490
Anyway, that's about
how big this number is.

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.390
And the numerical
integration methods

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.760
will give you about as
much accuracy as you

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.270
can get on the function itself.

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.100
And, of course,
some functions we

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.040
may have more trouble
approximating.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.400
But the function 1 / x, we
know pretty well how to do,

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.440
because we know how to divide.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.410
So since the function that
we're integrating here is 1 / x,

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.874
it's going to be not
too difficult to get

00:02:28.874 --> 00:02:29.540
some arithmetic.

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.740
Nevertheless, I'm
going to do this

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.210
in the simplest possible case.

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:44.040
Namely, just with two intervals.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.020
Now, you really can't expect
things to work so well

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.040
with two intervals.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.560
That's a pretty ridiculous
approximation to your function.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.830
When you have two
intervals, that

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.490
means you're looking at the
graph of this hyperbola.

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:04.510
And you have 1 here, and you
have 2 here and you have 3/2.

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.910
And you're really only
keeping track of the values

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.880
at these three spots.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.630
So the idea that you can
approximate the area just

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.940
by knowing the values
of three places

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.120
is a little bit of a
stretch of the imagination.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.850
But we're going
to try it anyway.

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:33.320
Now, the trapezoidal rule
is the following formula.

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:38.980
It's delta x (1/2 the first
value + the second value

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.290
+ 1/2 the third value).

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.930
In this case, the pattern
is 1/2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1/2.

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:53.540
And in this case, delta x =
1/2 because this interval's

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.120
of length 1.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.680
The b - a, right.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.990
Let's just point that out here.

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:05.410
Here, b = 2. a = 1. b - a = 1.

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.500
And the number n is 2.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:16.160
And so, delta x, which
is (b - a) / n, is 1/2.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.580
So here's what we get.

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:19.850
And let's just see
what this number is.

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:23.540
It's 1/2 of the value at here.

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.540
Well, so let's just check
what these values are.

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.560
This value is 1, this
value over here is 2/3,

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.320
and the last value is 1/2.

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.766
Because the function, of
course, was y = 1 / x.

00:04:36.766 --> 00:04:38.640
And those were the three
values that we have.

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:42.030
So y_0, this one is
y_0, this one is y_1,

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:47.480
and this one is y_2.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:05:00.780
Now, here we have 1/2*
1 + 2/3 + 1/2 * 1/2.

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.900
Now, on an exam,
I don't expect you

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.930
to add up long messes
of numbers like this.

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:09.700
When you have two
numbers, I expect

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.670
you to add them up if they're
reasonable, or subtract them.

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:14.530
Just as we do when we
take antiderivatives.

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:16.660
Like, for example,
I don't want you

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.860
to leave the answer to
an integration like this

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:19.490
in this form.

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.514
I want you to simplify
it at least down to here.

00:05:21.514 --> 00:05:23.180
And I of course don't
expect you to know

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:24.880
the numerical approximation.

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.417
But I certainly expect
you to be able to do that.

00:05:27.417 --> 00:05:29.000
On the other hand,
when the arithmetic

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.360
gets a little bit long,
you can relax a little bit.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.210
But I did carry this
out on my calculator.

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:41.240
Unless I'm mistaken,
it's about 0.96.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.820
It's pretty far off.

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.484
So remember what it was.

00:05:47.484 --> 00:05:49.650
It's what you get when you
get these straight lines.

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:52.170
And there are these little
extra pieces of junk there.

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:55.870
Now, don't trust that
too much, but the point

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:00.540
is that it's far off.

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:09.760
So now, let's take a
look at Simpson's Rule.

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:13.500
And I claim that Simpson's
Rule is surprisingly accurate.

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.500
In this case, really,
even a little more than it

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.410
deserves to be.

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:29.400
The formula is (delta x
/ 3) (y_0 + 4 y_1 + y_2).

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.460
So the pattern is
1, 4, 1, or 1, 4

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:39.200
and then it alternates 2's and
4's until 4, 1 at the very end.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:43.060
And if I just plug in the
numbers now, what I get

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:47.340
is 1/6, because
delta x = 1/2 again.

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:50.600
And the value for y_0 was 1.

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:55.120
And the value for y_1 was 2/3.

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:59.350
And the value for y_2 was 1/2.

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:03.740
So here's the
estimate in this case.

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:08.540
And this one I did
carry out carefully.

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:16.880
And it came out to 0.69444.

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:18.810
Which is actually
pretty impressive,

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:20.490
if you think about it.

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:26.050
Given what the logarithm is.

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:31.740
Now, what's going on with
Simpson's Rule in general

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:33.240
is this.

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:43.360
If you-- Simpson's
minus the exact answer,

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:46.970
in absolute value, is
approximately of the size

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:50.850
of (delta x)^4.

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:52.730
That's really the
way it behaves.

00:07:52.730 --> 00:08:03.300
Which means that if
delta x is about 1/10,

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:05.670
so if we had divided this
up into 10 intervals,

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:08.270
which we didn't, but if
we'd divided it up into 10

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:11.585
intervals, then you could
expect that delta x--

00:08:11.585 --> 00:08:15.320
the error would
be about 10^(-4).

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:21.090
In other words, four digits of
accuracy here for this thing.

00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:25.940
But the exact analysis of
this, a more careful analysis

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:27.640
of this, is in your textbook.

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:30.820
And I'm not going to do it.

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:33.750
But I just want to point out
that it is an effective method.

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:35.830
It really does give
you nice four-digit

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:38.510
with manageable-- you could
even really do it by hand.

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:42.040
It's so convenient,
the Simpson's Rule.

00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:46.140
Whereas the other rules
aren't really that impressive

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:51.790
as far as giving fairly
accurate answers.

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:54.330
The last little
remark to make is

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:57.520
that the reason is
that Simpson's Rule is

00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:59.300
matching a parabola.

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:03.650
And somehow the parabola
follows this curve better.

00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:05.890
It's giving the exact answer.

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:07.570
So I'll mention this.

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:23.590
Simpson's Rule is derived
using the exact answer

00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:32.770
for all degree 2 polynomials.

00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:36.680
In other words, parabolas.

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:38.410
All parabolas.

00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:40.450
But even all the
ones of lower degree.

00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:43.360
So straight lines would
work, and constants

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:44.390
would work as well.

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:47.770
Whereas the other ones only
work for, say, straight lines.

00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:51.200
The trapezoidal rule only
works for straight lines.

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:53.110
But there is a weird accident.

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:55.650
It turns out that it
also works for cubics.

00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:59.460
Once you get the formulas,
it works for cubics.

00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:06.630
So it's also exact for cubics.

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:12.400
And that's what explains
the fourth order validity.

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:14.900
The last thing that
I want to point out

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:17.820
is that this is extremely
vague, what I said there.

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:20.340
And you should be a little
bit cautious about it.

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:30.890
You need to watch out
for 1/x for x near 0.

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:34.120
All bets are off if the
function is singular.

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:36.250
And there's a lot
of area under there.

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:40.740
And it's also true that if
the derivative messes up,

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:41.770
you're in trouble too.

00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:44.480
You really need for the function
to be nice and smooth in order

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:46.700
for Simpson's Rule to work.

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:48.740
This is wath out.

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:55.920
That's a real wath out, but
we'll try to-- Watch out.

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:58.290
Watch out for whenever x near 0.

00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:00.770
Then this thing doesn't work.

00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:03.710
This thing really depends
on bounds on derivatives.

00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:05.780
But I'm going to be
relatively vague about that.

00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:12.780
I'm not attempting to give
you an error analysis here.

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:16.520
OK, so if you were
doing this on an exam,

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:21.600
how do you remember this
strange pattern of numbers?

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:27.250
The one thing that I want to
recommend to you is, as a way

00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:35.620
of remembering it, so
the one mnemonic device,

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:39.340
we'll call it a
mnemonic device here,

00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:42.850
for remembering what it
is that you're doing,

00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:48.990
is to remind yourself of
what happens for the simplest

00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:50.060
possible case.

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:53.730
Which is f(x) = 1.

00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:57.260
It seems very modest, but
if it doesn't give you

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.410
the exact answer
for f(x) = 1, you've

00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:02.220
got the wrong weightings.

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:06.120
And here, if you check out what
happens in the first formula

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:14.110
here, y_0 / 2 + y_1 +..., well,
we'll go all the way to y_(n-1)

00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:14.720
+ y_n / 2.

00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:19.450
If you check that
formula out here,

00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:21.440
this is the trapezoidal rule.

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:25.220
If you check it out for
this case, then what you get

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:29.050
is that this is equal
to delta x times what?

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:30.629
Well, all of these are 1's.

00:12:30.629 --> 00:12:32.170
And how many are
there in the middle?

00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:34.440
There are n - 1 of
them in the middle.

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:38.740
So it's 1/2 + n - 1 + 1/2.

00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:40.030
At the tail end.

00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:43.680
So all told it's delta x n.

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:50.980
And I remind you that
delta x = b - a / n.

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:57.030
So, delta x, this thing,
is equal to b - a.

00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:58.930
And that's just as it should be.

00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:03.130
What we just calculated is an
approximation to this integral

00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:04.080
here.

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:07.660
Which is just the area of
the rectangle of base b -

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:09.210
a and height 1.

00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:12.080
Which of course is b - a.

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:15.540
So this is the check that
you got your weighted average

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:18.610
correct here.

00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:20.880
You've put the correct
weightings on everything.

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:23.400
And you can do this same
thing with Simpson's Rule.

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:31.030
And match up those quantities.

00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:36.390
There was a question in
the room at some point.

00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:38.440
No, OK.

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:42.680
So now, the next thing
I want to do for you

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:49.730
is the loose end
which I left hanging.

00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:55.280
Namely, I want to compute that
mysterious constant square root

00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:56.680
of pi / 2.

00:13:56.680 --> 00:14:00.260
This is really one of the
most famous computations

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.420
in calculus.

00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:04.740
And it's a very,
very clever trick.

00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:09.160
I certainly don't expect you
to come up with this trick.

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:11.360
I certainly wouldn't
have myself.

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:15.750
But it's an important
thing to calculate.

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:17.560
And it's just very useful.

00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:19.310
So I'm going to
tell you about it.

00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:22.400
And it's just on the subject
that we're dealing with

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:28.260
in this unit; namely, slicing.

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.400
Or adding up.

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:38.850
So the first step, which is just
something that we already did,

00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:50.800
was that we found the
volume under this curve.

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:54.180
This bell-shaped
curve, e^(-r^2).

00:14:54.180 --> 00:15:00.300
But rotated around an axis.

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:09.020
Rotated around this axis.

00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:10.680
Around this way.

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:12.360
So we figured that out.

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:15.280
And that was a relatively
short computation.

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:18.870
I'm just going to remind
you, it goes by shells.

00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:23.500
We integrate the whole
range from 0 to infinity.

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:28.530
And we have 2 pi r
2 pi r e^(-r^2) dr.

00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:30.532
So this again is the
circumference of the shell.

00:15:30.532 --> 00:15:32.240
This is the height of
the shell, and this

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:34.650
is the thickness of the shell.

00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:45.280
Circumference,
height, thickness.

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:47.790
So we're just taking a little
piece here and sweeping it

00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:48.520
around.

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:52.000
And then adding up.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:58.250
And then this antiderivative
is pi-- -pi e^(-r^2),

00:15:58.250 --> 00:16:00.420
evaluated at 0 and infinity.

00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:03.140
And we worked this
out last time.

00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:06.520
This is pi.

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:12.700
It's pi (1 - 0).

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:13.200
Which is pi.

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:15.700
So the conclusion
is that V = pi.

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:20.220
We already know that.

00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:22.770
Now, the problem that
we want to deal with now

00:16:22.770 --> 00:16:31.460
is the problem not of
a volume, but an area.

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:32.990
And this looks quite different.

00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:37.340
And of course the answer
is going to be different.

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:38.250
But let's do it.

00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:40.610
So this is this
question mark here.

00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:47.970
And I'm going to do the one
from minus infinity to infinity.

00:16:47.970 --> 00:16:50.000
And I'll relate it
to what we talked

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.210
about earlier in this unit,
in just a couple of minutes

00:16:54.210 --> 00:17:00.520
when I show you the procedure
that we're going to follow.

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:02.710
So here's the
quantity and now, what

00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:07.210
this is interpreted as is the
area under this bell curve.

00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:22.950
This time, Q is really an area.

00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:26.370
Now, what's going to turn
out to happen, is this.

00:17:26.370 --> 00:17:27.920
This is the trick.

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:31.480
We're going to compute
V in a different way.

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:35.920
And you'll see it laid
out in just a second.

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:42.870
We will compute V by slices.

00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:45.370
We're going to slice it
like a piece of bread here.

00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:48.640
We're going to solve for
that same thing here.

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:52.120
And then, amazingly, what's
going to happen is that we will

00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:57.720
discover that V = Q^2.

00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:03.170
That's going to be
what's going to come out.

00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:07.009
And that's the end of the
computation that we want.

00:18:07.009 --> 00:18:08.800
Because actually we
already know what V is.

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:11.290
We don't want to read
this equation forward.

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:12.890
We want to read
it the other way.

00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:18.310
We want to say Q^2 = V,
which we already know is pi.

00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:29.770
And so Q is equal to
the square root of pi.

00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:33.680
I haven't shown this yet,
this is the weird part.

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:35.560
And I'm going to put
it in a little box

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:38.220
so that we know that this
is what we need to check.

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:43.070
We need to check this fact here.

00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:45.000
We haven't done that yet.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:51.500
Now, let me connect this with
what we did a few days ago.

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:54.690
With what I called one of
the important functions

00:18:54.690 --> 00:19:02.540
of mathematics besides
the ones you already know.

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:04.810
And so the function
that we were faced with,

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:15.080
and that we discussed,
was this one.

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:19.380
And then, we were interested
in the value at infinity.

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:23.780
We were interested in this.

00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:26.930
Which, if you draw
a picture of it,

00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:29.650
and you draw the
same bell curve,

00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:32.610
that's the area
under half. of it.

00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:35.850
That's the area starting
from 0 and going to infinity.

00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:37.470
That's the area under half.

00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:46.270
So this chunk is F of infinity.

00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:50.000
And now I hope that this
part of the connection

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.140
is not meant to be fancy.

00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:58.760
The idea here is that
Q = 2 F(infinity).

00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:00.190
This number here.

00:20:00.190 --> 00:20:04.380
And so F F(infinity) is equal
to the square root of pi

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:10.900
over 2, if we believe what
we said on the last panel.

00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:14.490
And that was the thing that I
drew a picture of on the board.

00:20:14.490 --> 00:20:18.390
Namely, the graph of
F looked like this.

00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:20.670
And there was this
asymptote, which

00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:25.020
was the limit F(x) tends
to square root of pi

00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:27.650
over 2, as x goes to infinity.

00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:30.560
That was that limiting value.

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:33.910
Which is F of infinity.

00:20:33.910 --> 00:20:40.460
So this is the asymptote.

00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:43.350
And now I've explained
the connection

00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:47.260
between what we claimed before,
which was quite mysterious,

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:50.840
and what we're actually going
to be able to check now.

00:20:50.840 --> 00:21:07.170
Concretely, by making
this computation.

00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:09.980
So how in the world can you
get something like this.

00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:14.490
What's in that orange
box there, that V = Q^2.

00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:19.300
Again, the technique
is to use slices here.

00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:21.860
And I'm going to have to
draw you a 3-D picture

00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:24.970
to visualize the slice.

00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:27.360
Let's do that.

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:30.520
I'm going to draw
three axes now,

00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:33.640
because we're now going to be
in three-dimensional space,

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:37.250
and I want you to imagine
the x-axis as coming out

00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:40.320
of the blackboard, the
y-axis is horizontal,

00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:41.980
and there's a new
axis, which I'll call

00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:45.090
the z-axis, which is going up.

00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:46.860
So what's happening
here is that I'm

00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:50.810
thinking of this-- This is,
if you like, some kind of side

00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:51.320
view.

00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:53.653
And this is a view where I've
tilted things a little bit

00:21:53.653 --> 00:21:57.080
up to the top.

00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:59.974
Now, the distribution,
or you could

00:21:59.974 --> 00:22:01.640
think of this target
in the plane, where

00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:04.110
the most likely places
to hit were in the middle

00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:05.510
and it died off.

00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:07.390
As we went down.

00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:11.400
Now, I want to draw a
picture of this graph.

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:15.240
I'm going to draw a
picture of e^(-r^2).

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:18.090
And it's basically a hump.

00:22:18.090 --> 00:22:22.420
So I'm going to take the
first-- the slice along y = 0.

00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:23.880
The y = 0 slice.

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:26.300
And I claim that that
goes up like this.

00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:28.310
And then comes back down.

00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:32.100
Let me shade this in,
so that you can see

00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:34.140
what kind of a slice this is.

00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:38.679
This is supposed to be along
this vertical plane here.

00:22:38.679 --> 00:22:40.220
Which is coming out
of the blackboard

00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:42.409
and coming towards you.

00:22:42.409 --> 00:22:43.200
And that's a slice.

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:46.630
Now, I'm going to draw
one more slice so that you

00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:49.000
can see what's happening.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.310
I'm going to draw a
slice at another place.

00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:52.860
Along here.

00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:55.030
This will be y = b.

00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:56.709
Some other level.

00:22:56.709 --> 00:22:58.500
And now I'm going to
show you what happens.

00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:02.960
What happens is that the
hump dies down a little bit.

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:06.750
So the bump is just
a little bit lower.

00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:10.284
And it's going to look a
little bit the same way.

00:23:10.284 --> 00:23:11.950
But it's just going
to be a bit smaller.

00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:15.380
So there's another slice here.

00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:16.940
Like that.

00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:20.890
And I want to give a
name to these slices.

00:23:20.890 --> 00:23:25.090
I'm going to call this A(b).

00:23:25.090 --> 00:23:36.130
That is, the area
of the b slice.

00:23:36.130 --> 00:23:39.790
Under the surface.

00:23:39.790 --> 00:23:41.010
OK?

00:23:41.010 --> 00:23:41.870
Yes, question.

00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:47.256
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:47.256 --> 00:23:48.380
PROFESSOR: Yeah, the solid.

00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:48.890
Yeah.

00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:52.830
We're trying to figure
out this volume here,

00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:56.780
which is the one we started
out with, by slices.

00:23:56.780 --> 00:23:59.500
So first I have to think
of-- I'm going to visualize--

00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:01.970
So here I didn't even visualize.

00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:03.490
I took a cross
section and I thought

00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:06.580
about how to spin it around
without actually doing that

00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:07.954
in three-dimensional space.

00:24:07.954 --> 00:24:10.120
But now I'm going to take
a different kind of slice.

00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:12.260
I'm going to take
that same bump, which

00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:13.680
is a three-dimensional object.

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:16.050
I'm going to lay
it down on a plane.

00:24:16.050 --> 00:24:17.540
Which looks like this.

00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:20.850
And then it's a bump here.

00:24:20.850 --> 00:24:22.260
It's a hump.

00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:27.350
And now I'm going to try to
slice it by various planes.

00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:29.370
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:29.370 --> 00:24:34.270
PROFESSOR: So one
way of defining

00:24:34.270 --> 00:24:37.609
the bump, as you just suggested,
is you take this curve

00:24:37.609 --> 00:24:39.150
and you rotate it
around this z-axis.

00:24:39.150 --> 00:24:41.400
So in other words, you make
this the axis of rotation,

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:43.505
you spin it around.

00:24:43.505 --> 00:24:44.130
That's correct.

00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:48.020
So that shows you that the
peaks as you go down here

00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:50.740
are going to descend
the same way.

00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:54.140
But I don't want to
draw those lines.

00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:57.780
I want to imagine what
the parallel slices are.

00:24:57.780 --> 00:24:59.610
Because I don't want
to get cross slices.

00:24:59.610 --> 00:25:01.950
I want all slices parallel
to the same thing.

00:25:01.950 --> 00:25:04.997
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:04.997 --> 00:25:05.580
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:13.070
This is not particularly
easy to visualize.

00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:17.960
Now, here's the formula
for volume by slices.

00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:23.900
The formula for volume by
slices is that you add up

00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:28.770
the areas of the slices.

00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:31.050
That's how you do it.

00:25:31.050 --> 00:25:32.465
You take each slice.

00:25:32.465 --> 00:25:33.840
You add the
cross-sectional area,

00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:36.170
and then you take a
little thickness, dy,

00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:38.330
and then you add all of them up.

00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:40.950
Because this is extending
over the whole plane,

00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:43.630
we're going to have to go all
the way from minus infinity

00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:45.100
to plus infinity.

00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:56.940
And this is the formula
for volumes by slicing.

00:25:56.940 --> 00:26:00.300
And now our goal, in order
to do this calculation,

00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:04.620
we're going to just fix
y is equal to some b.

00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:06.840
We're just going to fix
one of these slices.

00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:13.454
And we're going
to calculate A(b).

00:26:13.454 --> 00:26:14.870
That's what we
need to do in order

00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:23.030
to make this procedure succeed.

00:26:23.030 --> 00:26:27.740
This is the only place
where this method works.

00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:32.120
But it's an important one.

00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:34.195
In order to make
it work, I'm going

00:26:34.195 --> 00:26:37.760
to have to again draw the plot
from a different point of view.

00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:43.550
I'm going to do the top view.

00:26:43.550 --> 00:26:48.750
So I want to look down
on this x-y plane here.

00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:52.020
This is the x-direction,
and here's the y-direction.

00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:56.930
And then again I want
to draw my slice.

00:26:56.930 --> 00:27:00.760
My slice is here.

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:04.860
At y = b.

00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:07.430
So we're just
right on top of it.

00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:09.404
And it's coming up
at some kind of bump.

00:27:09.404 --> 00:27:11.070
Here, with a little
higher in the middle

00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:15.970
and going down on the sides.

00:27:15.970 --> 00:27:20.210
Now, the formula for
the height is this.

00:27:20.210 --> 00:27:25.290
If I take a distance r here,
the formula for the height

00:27:25.290 --> 00:27:27.290
of the bump is e^(-r^2).

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:33.390
I'll store that over here.

00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:37.910
e^(-r^2) is the
height at this place.

00:27:37.910 --> 00:27:41.020
If this distance
to the origin is r.

00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:43.360
That's true all the way around.

00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:48.622
And in terms of b and x,
we can figure out that

00:27:48.622 --> 00:27:49.580
by this right triangle.

00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:52.400
This height is b, and
this distance is x.

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:55.940
So r^2 = b^2 + x^2.

00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:02.560
Question.

00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:15.350
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:19.105
PROFESSOR: The question
is, is that the x-y plane.

00:28:19.105 --> 00:28:23.280
So the answer is that over here
I cleverly used the letter r.

00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:27.010
I avoided using y's
and z's or anything.

00:28:27.010 --> 00:28:28.970
And over here, this
is the distance r.

00:28:28.970 --> 00:28:31.650
And you like, this
is z, going up.

00:28:31.650 --> 00:28:33.430
That's the way to think of it.

00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:36.180
So that all of the
letters are consistent.

00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:39.170
So I just avoided
giving it a name.

00:28:39.170 --> 00:28:41.960
That's good, that's
exactly the point.

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:43.160
Alright.

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:46.870
So now, I claim I have
a formula for r^2.

00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:48.397
And so I can write this down.

00:28:48.397 --> 00:28:49.230
This e^(-b^2 + x^2).

00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:01.934
But now I'm going to use
the rule of exponents.

00:29:01.934 --> 00:29:04.350
Which is that this is the same
as e^(-b^2) times e^(-x^2).

00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:11.330
And that's going to be
the main way in which we

00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:15.590
use the particular function
that we're dealing with here.

00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:20.940
That's really the
main step, amazingly.

00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:33.470
So now I get to
compute what A(b) is.

00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:37.960
A(b) is the area under a curve.

00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:40.300
So it's going to be, let
me write it over here,

00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:47.160
A(b) is the area
under this curve here.

00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:51.580
Which is some constant
times-- so if you imagine,

00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:53.270
call this thing the name c.

00:29:53.270 --> 00:29:57.070
Under some curve, ce^(-x^2).

00:29:57.070 --> 00:29:59.040
Where the c is
equal to e^(-b^2).

00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:07.560
That's what our slice is.

00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:09.060
In fact, it looks
like one of those.

00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:12.970
It looks like one
of those bumps.

00:30:12.970 --> 00:30:14.630
Here's its formula again.

00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:17.850
It's the integral from
minus infinity to infinity

00:30:17.850 --> 00:30:19.500
of e^(-b^2) e^(-x^2) dx.

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:31.560
We just recopied
what I had up there.

00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:37.430
And this is the height at
each value of x, with b fixed.

00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:42.630
And now, so we have
a lot of steps here.

00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:44.680
But each of them
is very elementary.

00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:47.380
The first one was just
that law of exponents.

00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:49.520
That we could split
the two into products.

00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:51.970
Now I'm going to make that
splitting even further.

00:30:51.970 --> 00:30:53.420
This is a constant.

00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:55.150
It's not varying with x.

00:30:55.150 --> 00:30:59.060
So I'm going to factor
it out of the integral.

00:30:59.060 --> 00:31:02.230
This is e^(-b^2) times the
integral from minus infinity

00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:03.850
to infinity of e^(-x^2) dx.

00:31:06.390 --> 00:31:09.890
So this might look frightening,
but actually it's just

00:31:09.890 --> 00:31:11.110
the property of an integral.

00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:13.180
All integrals have
this kind of property.

00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:17.090
You can always factor
out a constant.

00:31:17.090 --> 00:31:20.900
And now here comes
the remarkable thing.

00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:26.920
This is e^(-b^2) times a number
which is now familiar to us.

00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:27.980
What is this number?

00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:29.280
This is what we're looking for.

00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:40.550
This is our unknown, Q.
So I've computed A(b),

00:31:40.550 --> 00:31:44.260
and now I'm ready to
finish the problem off.

00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:48.720
A(b) = e^(-b^2) Q. Q is
that strange number which we

00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:49.380
don't know yet.

00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:51.850
What it is.

00:31:51.850 --> 00:31:55.570
So now I'm going to
compute the whole volume.

00:31:55.570 --> 00:31:57.850
The whole volume,
remember, it's over there,

00:31:57.850 --> 00:32:02.540
it's minus infinity
to infinity, A(y) dy.

00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:05.300
And now I'm just going to plug
in the formula that we've found

00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:07.860
for A. Now I'm doing
this for each b,

00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:09.740
so I'm doing it
varying over all b's.

00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:12.710
So I have the integral from
minus infinity to infinity.

00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:15.490
And here I have e^(-y^2).

00:32:15.490 --> 00:32:17.620
I've replaced b by y.

00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:21.640
And now I have Q. And I have dy.

00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:23.970
I just recopied what
I had over there

00:32:23.970 --> 00:32:27.100
into the formula for slicing.

00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:29.920
And now, I'm going to do
this trick of factoring out

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:32.260
the constant a second time.

00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:33.860
This is a constant.

00:32:33.860 --> 00:32:35.180
It doesn't depend on y.

00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:38.030
It's the same for all y,
it just will factor out.

00:32:38.030 --> 00:32:40.880
So this is the same as Q
times the integral from minus

00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:47.350
infinity to infinity,
e^(-y^2) dy.

00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:52.200
And now, lo and behold,
this expression here.

00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:54.510
Of course, notice how
I defined Q. Let's

00:32:54.510 --> 00:32:56.950
go back carefully to
where Q is defined.

00:32:56.950 --> 00:33:02.900
Here's Q. This t is
a dummy variable.

00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:04.370
It doesn't matter
what I call it.

00:33:04.370 --> 00:33:05.790
I can call it x,
I can call it u,

00:33:05.790 --> 00:33:07.620
I can call it v.
In this case, I've

00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:10.020
given it two different names.

00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:13.030
At this stage, I called it x.

00:33:13.030 --> 00:33:14.860
And at this stage
I'm calling it y.

00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:17.970
But it's the same variable.

00:33:17.970 --> 00:33:20.650
And so this little chunk is
Q and altogether I have two

00:33:20.650 --> 00:33:23.320
of them, for Q^2
being the total.

00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:32.050
And that's the end
of the argument.

00:33:32.050 --> 00:33:33.010
It's a real miracle.

00:33:33.010 --> 00:33:45.920
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:47.580
PROFESSOR: Great question.

00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:49.490
The question is, wait a minute.

00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:53.620
As y changes, doesn't x change.

00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:58.120
And so then this
wouldn't be a constant.

00:33:58.120 --> 00:34:01.740
So that's the way in which
we've used the letters x and y

00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:04.110
in this whole course.

00:34:04.110 --> 00:34:07.710
When you get to 18.02,
you'll almost never do that.

00:34:07.710 --> 00:34:10.807
Always y and x will be
different variables.

00:34:10.807 --> 00:34:12.640
And they won't have to
depend on each other.

00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:15.700
Now, let me show you where on
this picture the x and the y

00:34:15.700 --> 00:34:17.610
are.

00:34:17.610 --> 00:34:21.000
We've got a whole x-y plane,
and here I'm fixing y = b,

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.220
y isn't varying.

00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:25.340
Whereas x is changing.

00:34:25.340 --> 00:34:29.000
So, in other words, I don't have
a relationship between x and y,

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:29.900
unless I fix it.

00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:32.690
In this case I've decided that
y is going to be constant.

00:34:32.690 --> 00:34:35.400
For all x.

00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:39.110
Over here, I made a computation.

00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:41.380
And I have a Q, which
is just a single number.

00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:44.830
No matter which b I took,
it didn't matter which.

00:34:44.830 --> 00:34:46.130
No matter which y equals b.

00:34:46.130 --> 00:34:47.930
Of course, I changed
the name to b so it

00:34:47.930 --> 00:34:50.630
wouldn't be so jarring to you.

00:34:50.630 --> 00:34:53.920
But in fact this
b was y all along.

00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:57.460
It's just that the x varied
completely independently

00:34:57.460 --> 00:34:57.960
of the y.

00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:00.300
I could fix the y and vary
the x, I could fix the x

00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:03.390
and vary the y.

00:35:03.390 --> 00:35:06.590
So it's a different
use of the letters.

00:35:06.590 --> 00:35:07.720
From what you're used to.

00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:10.360
It happens that y is
not a function of x.

00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:11.171
In this case.

00:35:11.171 --> 00:35:11.670
Yes.

00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:16.455
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:16.455 --> 00:35:17.080
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:23.030
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:25.610
PROFESSOR: The question
is, because I'm

00:35:25.610 --> 00:35:29.000
rotating around the z-axis,
doesn't x change exactly

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:30.210
as much as y does.

00:35:30.210 --> 00:35:33.790
What happens is that x and
y are symmetric variables.

00:35:33.790 --> 00:35:36.870
They can be treated equally.

00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:41.660
But if I decide to take slices
with respect to y being fixed

00:35:41.660 --> 00:35:45.070
and x varying, then of
course they're now separated,

00:35:45.070 --> 00:35:47.410
and I have a separate role
for the x and a separate role

00:35:47.410 --> 00:35:48.870
for the y.

00:35:48.870 --> 00:35:50.420
Or if I'd sliced
it the other way,

00:35:50.420 --> 00:35:51.920
I would have gotten
the same answer.

00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:54.560
I just would have reversed
the roles of x and y.

00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:56.100
So what's happening
is that x and y

00:35:56.100 --> 00:36:01.150
are on equal footing with
each other in this picture,

00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:02.650
and I could've
sliced the other way.

00:36:02.650 --> 00:36:04.610
I would have gotten
the same answer.

00:36:04.610 --> 00:36:07.660
That's more or less the
answer to your question.

00:36:07.660 --> 00:36:13.180
OK.

00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:16.300
Now I have given
you a review sheet,

00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:19.150
and I want to run
through, briefly,

00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:23.390
what's going to be on the exam.

00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:28.140
And this list of
exam questions is

00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:30.120
what's going to be on the exam.

00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:33.390
There are, sorry this is
not displayed correctly.

00:36:33.390 --> 00:36:35.110
So, exam questions,
but now I'm just

00:36:35.110 --> 00:36:36.490
going to show you what they are.

00:36:36.490 --> 00:36:38.090
There are five
questions on the exam.

00:36:38.090 --> 00:36:46.580
They are completely parallel
to what you got last year.

00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:48.100
So you should look at that test.

00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:50.570
It's worth looking at.

00:36:50.570 --> 00:36:54.750
And you'll see in the
descriptions on this sheet

00:36:54.750 --> 00:37:00.410
that what I'm describing
is what's on that test.

00:37:00.410 --> 00:37:04.160
So what's going to happen
is - and this is also

00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:06.790
posted on the Web
- is that you'll

00:37:06.790 --> 00:37:11.020
be expected to calculate
some definite integrals using

00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:13.750
the fundamental
theorem of calculus.

00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:16.000
Do a numerical approximation.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.930
There'll be a Riemann,
a trapezoidal rule

00:37:17.930 --> 00:37:19.550
and a Simpson's Rule.

00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:22.770
Calculate areas and volumes.

00:37:22.770 --> 00:37:25.510
And then some other
cumulative sum.

00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:29.990
Either an average value or
probability or perhaps work.

00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:32.410
And sketch a function
which is given

00:37:32.410 --> 00:37:37.380
in this form as an integral.

00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:42.020
So those are the
questions, and you'll

00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:46.080
see by the example of last
year's exam exactly the style.

00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:48.540
They're really going
to be very similar.

00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:49.450
Yes, question.

00:37:49.450 --> 00:38:01.582
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:01.582 --> 00:38:02.790
PROFESSOR: OK, good question.

00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:05.560
So the question is,
for Riemann sums,

00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:08.850
what's the difference
between upper and lower,

00:38:08.850 --> 00:38:19.750
and right and left?

00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:25.300
So here we have a Riemann sum.

00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:29.720
And I'm going to give
you a picture which is,

00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:33.045
maybe this function y = 1 /
x, which was the one that we

00:38:33.045 --> 00:38:37.900
were discussing earlier.

00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:40.420
If you take the
function y = 1 / x

00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:43.540
and you break it up
into pieces here,

00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:45.370
however it doesn't
matter how many pieces,

00:38:45.370 --> 00:38:48.390
let's just say there
are four of them.

00:38:48.390 --> 00:38:53.020
Then the lower Riemann
sum is the staircase

00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:55.490
which fits underneath.

00:38:55.490 --> 00:39:01.270
So this one is a picture
of the lower sum.

00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:03.220
It's always less.

00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:08.960
And in the case of a decreasing
function, it's going to be,

00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:19.530
so since if you like,
since 1 / x decreases,

00:39:19.530 --> 00:39:27.710
the lower sum equals
the right sum.

00:39:27.710 --> 00:39:29.980
You can see that
visually on this picture.

00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:32.730
The values you're
going to select

00:39:32.730 --> 00:39:38.360
are going to be the right
ends of the rectangles.

00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:40.980
The upper sum is the left one.

00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:43.340
Now, if the function
wiggles up and down,

00:39:43.340 --> 00:39:45.700
then you have to pick
whichever side is appropriate.

00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:47.366
Or maybe it'll be a
point in the middle,

00:39:47.366 --> 00:39:54.360
if the maximum is
achieved in the middle.

00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:55.370
Yeah, another question.

00:39:55.370 --> 00:40:02.549
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:02.549 --> 00:40:03.340
PROFESSOR: Correct.

00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:09.630
If the function is
increasing, then the lower sum

00:40:09.630 --> 00:40:11.170
is the left sum.

00:40:11.170 --> 00:40:13.630
So it just exactly
reverses what's here.

00:40:13.630 --> 00:40:17.920
So this is decreasing,
lower sum is right-hand sum.

00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:24.400
Increasing, lower
sum is left-hand sum.

00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:26.135
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:26.135 --> 00:40:26.760
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:44.549
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:44.549 --> 00:40:45.590
PROFESSOR: Good question.

00:40:45.590 --> 00:40:47.570
Suppose you're faced
with a function like this

00:40:47.570 --> 00:40:48.660
in this last problem.

00:40:48.660 --> 00:40:52.270
Which, generally, these
are the trickiest problems.

00:40:52.270 --> 00:40:54.150
And the question is,
how are you ever going

00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:55.790
to be able to decide
on an asymptote,

00:40:55.790 --> 00:40:58.110
even whether there
is an asymptote.

00:40:58.110 --> 00:41:01.930
And the answer is, you're not.

00:41:01.930 --> 00:41:05.211
It's going to be
pretty tricky to get

00:41:05.211 --> 00:41:07.460
keep track of what's happening
as it goes to infinity.

00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:08.960
We had an example
on the homework

00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:10.470
where is was
oscillating and it's

00:41:10.470 --> 00:41:12.100
very unclear what's going on.

00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:15.100
You have to do a very
long analysis for that.

00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:20.892
So in fact, just don't
worry about that now.

00:41:20.892 --> 00:41:22.350
At the very end of
the class, we'll

00:41:22.350 --> 00:41:24.180
talk a little bit
about these asymptotes.

00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:27.620
And really, the first issue
is whether they exist or not.

00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:30.275
And that's even something.

00:41:30.275 --> 00:41:32.150
That's a serious question
which we'll address

00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:33.800
at the very end of this course.

00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:35.680
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:36.680
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:40.840
It's not going to be
anything that complicated.

00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:42.350
Other questions?

00:41:42.350 --> 00:41:44.100
We we still have a
five whole minutes,

00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:50.440
and I have an example to give,
if nobody has a question.

00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:50.940
Yeah.

00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:51.773
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:51.773 --> 00:41:55.710
PROFESSOR: The question,
uh, will I tell you

00:41:55.710 --> 00:41:59.410
which one of what to use?

00:41:59.410 --> 00:42:00.910
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
PROFESSOR: When

00:42:00.910 --> 00:42:02.576
I tell you the numeric
approximation is,

00:42:02.576 --> 00:42:04.450
you'll see on the exam.

00:42:04.450 --> 00:42:06.450
The practice exam that you have.

00:42:06.450 --> 00:42:09.220
I will ask you for all three.

00:42:09.220 --> 00:42:11.620
I will ask you for the Riemann
sum, the trapezoidal rule,

00:42:11.620 --> 00:42:12.660
and the Simpson's rule.

00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:16.104
I'm guaranteeing you they'll
all three be on the exam.

00:42:16.104 --> 00:42:18.020
I'm guaranteeing that
every single thing which

00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:20.930
is on that piece of
paper is on the exam.

00:42:20.930 --> 00:42:23.865
And you'll see it on the
exam that you've got.

00:42:23.865 --> 00:42:27.420
It's exactly parallel
to what's there.

00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:31.341
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:31.341 --> 00:42:32.840
PROFESSOR: So with
areas and volume,

00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:36.720
the question is will I tell
you which method to use.

00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:48.340
So let's discuss that.

00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:58.180
So with areas and volumes,
there's basically--

00:42:58.180 --> 00:43:00.170
So this is always
true with areas.

00:43:00.170 --> 00:43:07.040
And it's true with
volumes of revolution.

00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:08.970
By the way you should
read this sheet.

00:43:08.970 --> 00:43:12.740
Not everything that's
on here have I said.

00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:15.020
But you should read it.

00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:16.470
Because it's all relevant.

00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:19.820
So with volumes of revolution,
you always work your way

00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:25.600
back to some 2-D diagram.

00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:30.910
So there's some 2-D
diagram which is always--

00:43:30.910 --> 00:43:33.090
two-dimensional
diagram, which is always

00:43:33.090 --> 00:43:34.960
connected with these problems.

00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:37.960
I mean, something this hard
is really just too hard

00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:39.080
to do on an exam, right?

00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:41.538
I mean, I'm not going to ask
you something this complicated

00:43:41.538 --> 00:43:42.472
on the exam.

00:43:42.472 --> 00:43:44.180
Because this involves
a three-dimensional

00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:47.200
visualization.

00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:50.270
But once you're
down to 2-D, you're

00:43:50.270 --> 00:43:52.180
supposed to be
able to handle it.

00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:56.710
Now, what's the main issue after
you've got your 2-D diagram?

00:43:56.710 --> 00:43:59.990
The main issue is, do you
want to integrate with respect

00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:06.950
to dx or dy?

00:44:06.950 --> 00:44:13.850
And the answer is
that it will depend.

00:44:13.850 --> 00:44:16.810
And if there's one
that's going to cause

00:44:16.810 --> 00:44:21.310
you incredible difficulty,
and I feel that you're not

00:44:21.310 --> 00:44:24.940
able to dodge it, then
I might give you a hint

00:44:24.940 --> 00:44:27.750
and say you'd better use
shells, or you'd better

00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:31.370
use disks or washers
or something like that.

00:44:31.370 --> 00:44:34.760
But if I feel that you're
grown up enough to figure out

00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:37.470
which one it is, because
one of them is so ridiculous

00:44:37.470 --> 00:44:40.840
you say forget it, immediately,
after thinking about it.

00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:43.460
Then I won't tell you which one.

00:44:43.460 --> 00:44:44.870
Because I figure,
in other words,

00:44:44.870 --> 00:44:47.160
I don't want you
to waste your time.

00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:50.580
But I'm willing to waste a
minute or two of your time

00:44:50.580 --> 00:44:57.420
on a wild goose chase.

00:44:57.420 --> 00:45:01.380
So let me give you
an example of this.

00:45:01.380 --> 00:45:14.670
Suppose you're looking at the
curve y between 0 and x - x^3.

00:45:14.670 --> 00:45:17.380
So this is some kind of lump.

00:45:17.380 --> 00:45:18.460
Like this.

00:45:18.460 --> 00:45:25.080
It goes from 0 to 1, because the
right-hand side is 0 at 0 and 1

00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:25.921
here.

00:45:25.921 --> 00:45:26.920
It's some kind of thing.

00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:29.850
And there are these
two possibilities.

00:45:29.850 --> 00:45:33.220
One of them is to do shells.

00:45:33.220 --> 00:45:41.040
And then, so this is supposed
to be rotated around the y-axis.

00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:45.940
In this case.

00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:48.519
And the same would apply,
actually, to the area problem.

00:45:48.519 --> 00:45:50.560
So I'm doing a slightly
more complicated problem.

00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:53.660
But you could ask for the area
underneath this, and so forth.

00:45:53.660 --> 00:45:54.480
OK.

00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:57.400
So we can integrate this dx,
or we can integrate this dy.

00:45:57.400 --> 00:46:00.130
This indicates that
I'm deciding that this

00:46:00.130 --> 00:46:02.600
is going to be of thickness
dx, and I'm integrating dx.

00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:04.940
So that's a choice
that I'm making.

00:46:04.940 --> 00:46:07.160
Now, the minute I
made that choice

00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:10.000
I know that these are shells.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.980
Because they sweep around this
way and that makes them shells.

00:46:12.980 --> 00:46:15.460
Cylindrical shells.

00:46:15.460 --> 00:46:19.210
And if I do that,
the setup is this.

00:46:19.210 --> 00:46:25.540
It's 2 2 pi x (x - x^3) dx.

00:46:25.540 --> 00:46:28.340
Now, I claim that when
you get to this point,

00:46:28.340 --> 00:46:30.580
you already know you've won.

00:46:30.580 --> 00:46:32.920
Because this is an easy
integral to calculate.

00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:34.640
So you're done here.

00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:37.840
You're happy.

00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:42.930
Now, if you happened to say,
oh gee, I hate to do this.

00:46:42.930 --> 00:46:47.040
I want to do
something clever, you

00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:54.220
could try to do it
with cutting this way.

00:46:54.220 --> 00:46:56.500
Let's do this.

00:46:56.500 --> 00:47:01.610
And this would be
the dy thickness.

00:47:01.610 --> 00:47:04.760
And then when you
sweep this around,

00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:10.560
you get what we call a washer.

00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:14.710
Which is really just the
difference of two disks.

00:47:14.710 --> 00:47:24.560
So the shape here is this
thing swung around this axis.

00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:26.110
And it looks like this.

00:47:26.110 --> 00:47:29.270
So it's going to be the
difference of radii.

00:47:29.270 --> 00:47:32.580
So what's the formula for this?

00:47:32.580 --> 00:47:37.070
It's some integral of
pi times the right end,

00:47:37.070 --> 00:47:39.550
which I'll call x_2,
and here the left end,

00:47:39.550 --> 00:47:40.720
which I'll call x_1.

00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:43.860
So this is pi pi
(x_2^2 - x_1^2) dy.

00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:50.510
Now, already at this stage,
you think to yourself

00:47:50.510 --> 00:47:54.740
this is more complicated
than the other method.

00:47:54.740 --> 00:47:56.500
So you've already abandoned it.

00:47:56.500 --> 00:47:59.790
But I'm just going to go one
step further into this one

00:47:59.790 --> 00:48:01.860
to see what it is
that's happening.

00:48:01.860 --> 00:48:08.950
If you try to figure out what
these values x_1 and x_2 are,

00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:14.740
that corresponds to solving
for x_1 and x_2 in terms of y.

00:48:14.740 --> 00:48:17.200
So that's the
following equation.

00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:25.590
x_1 and x_2 solve the
equation that-- the curve, x -

00:48:25.590 --> 00:48:32.080
x^3 is equal y.

00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:33.790
Now, look at this equation.

00:48:33.790 --> 00:48:42.290
That's the equation x^3--
sorry, x^3 - x + y, I guess.

00:48:42.290 --> 00:48:43.320
Let's see.

00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:46.880
Yeah, that's right,
is equal to 0.

00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:53.370
This is a cubic equation.

00:48:53.370 --> 00:48:55.060
Although there is
a formula for this.

00:48:55.060 --> 00:48:57.351
You've never been taught the
formula for this equation.

00:48:57.351 --> 00:48:58.920
So therefore, you
will never, ever

00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:02.560
be able to get a formula for
x_2 and x_1 as a function of y.

00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:05.030
And you'll never be able
to compute this one.

00:49:05.030 --> 00:49:08.030
This is more than just a dead
end, it's like crash, burn,

00:49:08.030 --> 00:49:11.300
and, you know, self-destruct.

00:49:11.300 --> 00:49:14.670
So there may be such a
thing, so do the other way.

00:49:14.670 --> 00:49:17.490
Good luck, folks.
