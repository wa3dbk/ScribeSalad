00:03:10.618 --> 00:03:11.117
PROFESSOR: I'm sorry.

00:03:11.117 --> 00:03:14.380
I have to give this to you.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:15.777
Basically OK, except you
didn't understand

00:03:15.777 --> 00:03:17.027
it the first time.

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:20.060
OK.

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.600
Good morning.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:21.965
Happy spring.

00:03:21.965 --> 00:03:24.290
Happy April.

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.370
We're running a little late.

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.850
I'll try to finish chapter
nine today and start on

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.150
chapter ten.

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.685
Ashish may have chapter
ten here later.

00:03:34.685 --> 00:03:37.920
If not, it'll be on the web.

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.390
So we've been talking about
convolutional codes.

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.710
Specifically rate 1/n
convolutional codes.

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:46.960
One input n outputs.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.110
As you may imagine, there
are also rate k/n

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.500
convolutional codes.

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.250
Generalization to k
inputs n outputs.

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:00.870
These have not been so much used
in practice, because in

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.190
general, we're using these
binary codes in the power

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.630
limited regime, and
we want low rates.

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.770
So 1/n is a good rate.

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:14.750
1/2, 1/3, 1/4, or down to 1/6
are common kinds of rates.

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.079
So I haven't bothered to develop
the more elaborate

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:19.709
theory for rate k/n codes.

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.670
The rate 1/n codes,
just to review.

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:29.200
The code is simply defined as
the set of all possible output

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:34.050
sequences of a convolutional
encoder, whose N impulse

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:39.580
responses are written as an
n-tuple g of d as the inputs

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.750
range over all Laurent

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.680
sequences, bi-infinite sequences.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.710
And what we showed last time
is that without loss of

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:55.620
generality or optimality, we
could always take this g of d

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.670
to be of a particular
canonical form.

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:02.300
Namely, the g of d could be
taken to be a set of n

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:08.900
polynomials, g_j of d, that
were relatively prime.

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.610
And for any code, you can find
such a canonical encoder by

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:18.990
its unique [UNINTELLIGIBLE] two
units, and specifies the

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.790
code, clearly, by this.

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:27.230
So that's a nice canonical
encoder to take.

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:29.750
It furthermore has the property
that there's an

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:32.030
obvious realization of
this encoder in the

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:35.810
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] register form
with nu memory units.

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:38.840
And therefore 2 to
the nu states.

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:43.560
And we will prove in chapter ten
that this is the minimal

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.480
possible encoder
for this code.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.050
In other words, there are lots
of different encoders that

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:51.340
generate this code, but you
can't possibly encode it with

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:58.422
fewer than the state space of
dimension less than nu.

00:05:58.422 --> 00:06:01.350
That's the way it's going
to sound in chapter ten.

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:03.980
So we haven't quite got there
yet, but it's a minimal

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:08.020
encoder, therefore,
in that sense.

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:08.560
All right.

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:13.560
Today we're going to go now and
exploit the finite state

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:24.100
structure of this code, to get
a very efficient maximum

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:27.930
likelihood sequence decoding
algorithm called the Viterbi

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:30.470
algorithm, which I'm sure
you've all heard of.

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:35.025
It's become very famous, not
only in this field, but really

00:06:35.025 --> 00:06:38.470
in any place where you're trying
to observe a finite

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:41.130
state machine in memory-less
noise.

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:45.210
A finite state hidden markov
model, if you like.

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:49.100
And so now it's used, for
instance, in the detection of

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:53.030
genomes, where the exons end and
the introns start and so

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:55.940
forth, and the garbage is.

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:59.970
And people use it who have no
idea that it was originally a

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:02.560
digital communications
algorithm.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.190
But it's a very obvious
algorithm.

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:07.850
It's come up in many different
forms, and Viterbi, in a way,

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:09.880
was just lucky to get
his name on it.

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:15.830
Because it would come up very
easily as soon as you pose the

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:18.390
problem correctly.

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:21.315
Let's start out with terminated

00:07:21.315 --> 00:07:22.685
convolutional codes.

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:31.210
Which I forget whether I started
on this last time.

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:34.460
I think I may have.

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:36.580
But we'll start from
scratch again.

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:43.130
When I say terminated, I mean
that we're going to take only

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:46.370
a subset of the code words
that start at a

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:47.500
certain time --

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:49.350
say, time 0 --

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:53.100
continue for some finite
time, and then end.

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:56.830
And in this set up, with this
canonical encoder, it's

00:07:56.830 --> 00:08:05.640
polynomial, the easy way to
specify that is to let u of d

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:10.380
be a finite sequence that
starts at time 0.

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:13.570
That's called a polynomial.

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:18.440
and let's restrict
its degree --

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:23.680
degree u of d less than k.

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:29.150
In other words, it looks like u0
plus u1 d plus so forth up

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:33.260
to uk minus 1 d.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:38.150
Therefore I've chosen k, so I
really have k information bits

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:39.400
or input bits.

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:44.210
All right?

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:49.730
So I specify u0 through
uk minus 1.

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:52.320
I use that as the input
in my encoder.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:56.220
What is then my code,
my truncated code,

00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:00.250
let's call it ck --

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:03.650
that's not a very good notation,
but we'll use it

00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:05.240
just for now --

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:15.230
will be the set of all u of d,
g of d such that u of d is

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:23.310
polynomial and the degree of
u of d is less than k.

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:26.940
OK.

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:30.110
So we ask what that code
is going to be.

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:35.990
And let's take some
simple examples.

00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:40.700
Turns out when we terminate
codes, we always choose

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:44.750
polynomial encoders, so the code
will naturally collapse

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:47.730
back to the 0 state.

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:49.120
How long?

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:55.280
Nu time units after the
input stops coming in.

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:59.480
The outputs will be all 0 at
that point and forevermore.

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:02.870
The shift register will clear
itself out nu time units

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:08.390
later, and then they'll
be all 0.

00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:12.020
So the code really starts
at time 0 and ends

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:15.750
at time k plus nu.

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:19.100
So we aren't going to worry, in
this case, whether the code

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:22.030
is non-catastrophic or not.

00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:25.020
Here one of the principal
properties that we had was

00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:30.120
this property guaranteed
non-catastrophic.

00:10:34.458 --> 00:10:39.270
And in fact, is necessary
for non-catastrophicity.

00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:42.470
So we spent a lot of time
talking about why that would

00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:45.340
be a bad thing, to
be catastrophic.

00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:45.780
OK.

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:54.980
But let's take a catastrophic
rate 1/1 encoder, which simply

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:58.100
we have g of d equals
1 plus d.

00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:02.530
You remember this encoder
as nu equals 1.

00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:04.845
The input looks like this.

00:11:04.845 --> 00:11:08.210
uk, uk minus 1.

00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:12.390
And we simply add these, yk.

00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:19.680
So we get y of d equals
1 plus d u of d.

00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:22.890
OK.

00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:33.720
Now, if the input to this is a
finite sequence, a polynomial,

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:38.440
let's see what this code
can possibly be.

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:39.720
What the code's going
to look like.

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:43.920
The code's going to start
in state 0, at time 0.

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:47.420
So here's the time.

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:51.260
At the first time, we can either
get a 0 in our a 1 in,

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.865
and accordingly, it will
go to state 0 or 1.

00:11:57.110 --> 00:12:02.300
At the second time, we can go
to state 0 with another 0 or

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:04.150
just state 1 with a 1.

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:08.910
If we get a 1 in and we're in
state 1, then the output is

00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:12.260
going to be 0, and we'll
stay in state 1.

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:16.140
If we get a 0 in, the output
will be a 1, and we'll go back

00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:17.430
to state 0.

00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:19.360
So this is what a
typical trellis

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.210
section looks like here.

00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:23.060
We have all possible
transitions

00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:25.190
between the two states.

00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:29.380
And so now it goes on for
a while like this.

00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:31.820
Time invariantly.

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:40.640
There are 1, dot dot dot, and
then finally, at some time --

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:47.050
say this is time k, or maybe
it's time k minus 1 --

00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:50.000
time index is a little fuzzy
here -- we don't

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.730
put any more 1s in.

00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:58.620
We only put 0s on from
that time forward.

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:01.930
So we could have one more
transition back to state 0,

00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:06.920
and then after that it just
stays in state 0 forevermore.

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:09.030
And this isn't very
interesting.

00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:12.650
It was in time 0 all the
time before here.

00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:15.570
It was in state 0 all the time
before there and put out 0s.

00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:19.410
It was in state 0 all the time
after here and put out 0s.

00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:23.780
And this is clearly not
conveying any information.

00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:25.250
Not an interesting
part of the code.

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:28.750
So we're going to consider the
code just to be defined over

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:36.140
these k plus 1 units of time.

00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:42.690
And so y of d we're going
to consider to be a

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:44.650
polynomial of degree k.

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:55.096
Now we're going to assume
that they're k bits in.

00:13:55.096 --> 00:13:57.800
Then we're going to wait one
more time to let the shift

00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:01.850
register clear out,
which is nu.

00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:06.095
And at that time, we're going
to take whatever y is, and

00:14:06.095 --> 00:14:07.490
then we're going to
terminate it.

00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:17.220
So if we consider this now, we
have a block code whose length

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:22.800
is the number of non-zero
coefficients of y of d.

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:28.450
So we have n equals k plus
1, we have k by design

00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:34.480
information bits, and
what's the minimum

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:35.690
non-zero weight of this?

00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:37.000
It's linear.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.665
What's its minimum
non-zero weight,

00:14:38.665 --> 00:14:39.915
or its minimum distance?

00:14:42.614 --> 00:14:43.720
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:44.570
PROFESSOR: 1.

00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:47.300
Show me a code word
of weight 1.

00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:48.550
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:54.425 --> 00:14:58.320
PROFESSOR: I claim the minimum
non-zero weight is 2 by

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:00.580
typical argument.

00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:02.920
I have the all 0 sequence.

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:06.140
If I ever leave the all 0
sequence, I accumulate 1 unit

00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:07.890
of Hamming weight.

00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:10.890
And I need to ultimately come
back to the all 0 sequence,

00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:13.370
because I've made everything
finite here.

00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:16.300
So in this case, I can make
the argument that I always

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:18.120
have to come back to
the all 0 sequence.

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:21.140
Whenever I merge back into
the all 0 sequence, I'll

00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:23.850
accumulate another
unit of weight.

00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:29.910
So this is a code with
minimum distance 2.

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:32.090
Minimum non-zero weight 2.

00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:37.620
And in fact, it's just the
single parity-check code of

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:41.845
length n equals k plus 1.

00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:47.230
OK?

00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:52.770
And if you ask yourself,
can you generate any --

00:15:52.770 --> 00:15:56.390
this is supposedly the
even weight code.

00:15:56.390 --> 00:16:00.730
It contains all even weight
k plus 1-tuples.

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:04.380
And I think you can convince
yourself that you can generate

00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:11.050
any of these k plus 1 even
weight k-tuples.

00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:13.120
In fact, the generator
matrix for this code.

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:13.380
Look.

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:15.160
Here's a set of generators.

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.120
1 1 is in the code.

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:18.770
0 1 1 is in the code.

00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:21.020
0 0 1 1 in the code.

00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:24.480
So here's a set of generators.

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:27.120
0 1 1.

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:29.785
Generator matrix for the
code looks like this.

00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:34.040
We just go like that.

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:37.870
And with these k generators,
you can generate any even

00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:41.030
weight code word.

00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:45.150
So we get a kind of
convolutional form to the

00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:46.270
generator matrix.

00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:50.920
A sliding parity-check form
to the generator matrix.

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:51.650
OK.

00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:55.470
So I assert that this is the
single parity-check code.

00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:56.630
So here's a trellis

00:16:56.630 --> 00:16:59.790
representation for a block code.

00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:00.170
Yeah?

00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:01.420
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:11.609
PROFESSOR: I'm sure I've got the
time indices screwed up.

00:17:11.609 --> 00:17:15.390
But I put in k bits.

00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:17.270
I wait 1 more unit of time --

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:18.730
nu equals 1 --

00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:20.089
for this to clear out.

00:17:20.089 --> 00:17:22.560
So I get out k plus 1 bits.

00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:24.250
Think of it in terms
of this here.

00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:29.390
I put in k, the last input you
think of as necessarily being

00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:34.088
0, and I take the outputs
here for k plus 1 times.

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:38.420
OK.

00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:41.740
So first of all, a couple
points here.

00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:44.195
AUDIENCE: In general, the length
will be k plus nu?

00:17:44.195 --> 00:17:46.340
PROFESSOR: In general, length
will be k plus nu.

00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:48.250
So let's write that down.

00:17:52.620 --> 00:18:09.010
So in general, by terminating
a rate 1/n --

00:18:09.010 --> 00:18:11.550
nu is called the constraint
length --

00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:18.380
constraint length nu, or 2
to the nu state code --

00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:32.160
convolutional code after k
inputs, we get a binary linear

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:36.480
block code whose parameters
are --

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:40.010
we have k information bits.

00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:47.150
We have k plus nu non-trivial
output times.

00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:50.410
At each output time, I
get n output bits.

00:18:50.410 --> 00:18:57.070
So it's n times k plus nu
is the total effective

00:18:57.070 --> 00:19:00.020
length of the code.

00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:06.140
And the distance, we would have
to say, is greater than

00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:10.520
or equal to the distance of the
block code is greater than

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:13.260
or equal to the distance of
the convolutional code.

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:14.110
Why?

00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:22.490
Because all of the words in this
block code are actually

00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:25.380
sequences in the convolutional
code.

00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:30.960
I'm assuming here that the code
is not catastrophic, so

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:33.660
it's sufficient to look at all
the finite sequences in the

00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:36.300
convolutional code.

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:36.690
All right.

00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:40.390
And in general, the block code
distance is almost always

00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:42.540
going to be equal to the
convolutional code distance.

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:48.442
And this is just for
finite code words.

00:19:54.710 --> 00:20:11.820
So as another example, suppose
we take our standard rate 1/2,

00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:18.550
nu equals 2, distance equals
5, convolutional code.

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:21.910
Our example 1 that we've
been using all along.

00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:33.620
Suppose I terminate with
k equals 4, then I'm

00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:34.420
going to get what?

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:44.760
I'm going to get a 2 times 6,
I'm going to get a 12, 4, 5

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:46.370
binary linear block code.

00:20:51.170 --> 00:20:55.630
That is not so bad, actually.

00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:57.870
There's a point that I'm
not going to make

00:20:57.870 --> 00:20:59.570
very strongly here.

00:20:59.570 --> 00:21:08.717
But terminated convolutional
codes can be good block codes.

00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:18.920
And in fact, asymptotically,
by choosing the parameters

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:24.960
correctly, you can show that you
can get a random ensemble

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:28.960
of terminated convolutional
codes that is as good as the

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:33.150
best possible random ensemble
of block codes.

00:21:33.150 --> 00:21:36.190
So terminated convolutional
codes is one way of

00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:41.860
constructing optimal block codes
in the asymptotic limit.

00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:45.250
These parameters aren't bad.

00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:47.670
Here's a rate 1/3 code
with distance 5.

00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:50.470
Not too long.

00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:53.110
You know, you might compare
it to what?

00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:56.110
The BCH code?

00:21:56.110 --> 00:22:03.650
There's a 15 7 5 BCH code,
which is clearly better,

00:22:03.650 --> 00:22:05.210
because it's higher rate.

00:22:05.210 --> 00:22:08.690
But if you shorten this code,
you have to shorten this by 3,

00:22:08.690 --> 00:22:10.490
this by 3 to keep
the distance.

00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:12.756
You would get the same code.

00:22:12.756 --> 00:22:18.690
So it's not optimum, but
it's not too bad.

00:22:18.690 --> 00:22:22.230
And furthermore, from this
construction, you get a

00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:30.030
trellis representation,
which in this case

00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:32.252
would look like this.

00:22:32.252 --> 00:22:36.140
It looks like the trellis that
we started to draw last time.

00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:41.090
Sorry.

00:22:41.090 --> 00:22:44.710
Doesn't look like that.

00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:48.755
This guy goes down here,
this guy comes here,

00:22:48.755 --> 00:22:50.860
this guy goes here.

00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:52.410
This continues for a while.

00:23:03.410 --> 00:23:06.950
And then finally, when we start
to enforce all zeros, we

00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:10.250
only have one possible output
from each of these.

00:23:13.976 --> 00:23:17.025
And we get a trellis that
looks like that.

00:23:17.025 --> 00:23:17.390
All right?

00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:19.270
Which is 1, 2, 3 --

00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:22.430
I did it correctly for
this code, actually.

00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:24.030
Because each of these
is going to have a

00:23:24.030 --> 00:23:26.034
2-tuple output on it.

00:23:26.034 --> 00:23:33.000
And that looked like 0,0
0,0 0,0 0,0 0,0.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.330
Each of the information bits
causes a two-way branch, no

00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:37.960
matter where you are
in the trellis.

00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:41.070
So here's 1, here's 2,
here's 3, here's 4.

00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:42.230
That's the end of them.

00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:47.480
We wait for nu equal 2 to let
the states converge back to 0.

00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:53.160
So that's a trellis
representation of this 12 4 5

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:54.410
block code.

00:23:57.300 --> 00:23:59.270
OK.

00:23:59.270 --> 00:24:03.450
I want to talk about terminated
block codes,

00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:06.930
terminated trellis codes,
convolutional codes as block

00:24:06.930 --> 00:24:09.750
codes, for two reasons.

00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:13.960
One is to say we can get
block codes that way.

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:20.130
But the other is to introduce
the Viterbi algorithm for

00:24:20.130 --> 00:24:21.845
terminated convolutional
codes.

00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:28.750
I think it's easier first to
look at how the algorithm

00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:32.390
works when you have a finite
trellis like this, and then

00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:36.800
we'll go on and say, well, how
would this work if we let the

00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:40.700
trellis become very long, or
in principle, infinite?

00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:42.510
Would the Viterbi algorithm
still work?

00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:46.130
And it becomes obvious
that it does.

00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:49.690
So this is going to be a maximum
likelihood sequence

00:24:49.690 --> 00:24:51.420
detection or decoding
algorithm.

00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:02.840
We're going to assume that each
time here, we get to see

00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:04.890
two things.

00:25:04.890 --> 00:25:07.100
Corresponding to the two
bits we transmit.

00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:12.940
So we transmit yk according
to which trellis

00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:14.390
branch we're on --

00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:19.330
y0 at this point -- and we
receive a 2-tuple r0.

00:25:19.330 --> 00:25:22.340
If we were on a binary input
additive white Gaussian

00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:30.400
channel, this would go into,
actually, the 2-PAM map, two

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:36.470
plus or minus alphas, and be
received as two real numbers.

00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:38.680
And we do the same thing here.

00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:46.670
y1, we receive r1, and so forth,
up to yk plus nu, or k

00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:53.645
plus nu minus 1, I think it
is, rk plus nu minus 1.

00:25:53.645 --> 00:25:54.110
OK.

00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:56.930
So we have a transmit 2-tuple
and a received

00:25:56.930 --> 00:25:58.670
2-tuple every time.

00:25:58.670 --> 00:26:02.630
And we're going to assume that
the channel is memoryless so

00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:07.130
that the probabilities of
receiving the various possible

00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:11.310
received values, the
likelihoods, are independent

00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:13.230
from time unit to time unit.

00:26:13.230 --> 00:26:16.420
That's the only way
this works.

00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:26.330
Then if I want to get the total
probability of r given

00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:29.210
y, where now I'm talking about
over the whole block, this

00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:40.290
factors into the probabilities
of rk given yk, yes?

00:26:40.290 --> 00:26:42.380
That's what I'm going
to depend on.

00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:46.710
This is what's called the
memoryless condition,

00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:49.770
memoryless channel.

00:26:49.770 --> 00:26:54.200
The transition probabilities do
not depend on what's been

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:57.530
sent or received in
previous blocks.

00:26:57.530 --> 00:27:03.970
Or it's more convenient to use
the minus log likelihood

00:27:03.970 --> 00:27:11.380
equals now the sum of the minus
log p of rk given yk.

00:27:14.030 --> 00:27:24.350
So maximum likelihood is
equivalent to minimize the

00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:25.600
neg-log likelihood.

00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:33.760
OK.

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:39.040
I receive only one thing
in each time unit.

00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:42.840
And each trellis branch
corresponds to transmitting a

00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:44.860
specific thing.

00:27:44.860 --> 00:28:00.650
So I can label each trellis
branch with the appropriate

00:28:00.650 --> 00:28:06.970
minus log p of rk given yk.

00:28:06.970 --> 00:28:09.820
Do you see that?

00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:13.790
In other words, for this trellis
branch down here,

00:28:13.790 --> 00:28:21.520
which is associated with y2
equals 0 1, or s of y2 equals

00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:32.040
alpha minus alpha, suppose I
receive r2 equals r1, r2, I

00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:35.580
would label this by, say, the
Euclidean distance between

00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:40.580
what I transmitted for that
branch and what I received.

00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:44.870
For instance, on the additive
white Gaussian channel, this

00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:51.940
would simply be rk
minus s of yk.

00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:53.965
The Euclidean distance
squared.

00:28:56.500 --> 00:29:01.020
Or equivalently, minus the inner
product, the correlation

00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:04.460
between rk and s of yk.

00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:08.810
You know, these are equivalent
metrics.

00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:13.720
Or on a binary symmetric
channel, might be the Hamming

00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:17.600
distance between what I
received and what I

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:19.760
transmitted, both of which
would be binary

00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:21.085
2-tuples, in this case.

00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:25.520
It's just some measure
of distance --

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:28.240
Log likelihood distance,
Euclidean distance, Hamming

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:29.900
distance --

00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:33.250
between the particular thing I
would have transmitted if I'd

00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:37.700
been on this branch and the
particular thing that I

00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:39.410
actually did receive.

00:29:39.410 --> 00:29:44.230
So having received a whole block
of data, I can now put a

00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:47.090
cost on each of these
branches.

00:29:47.090 --> 00:29:51.695
What's the minus log likelihood
cost if I say that

00:29:51.695 --> 00:29:53.660
the code word goes through
that branch?

00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:54.910
What does it cost me?

00:29:58.077 --> 00:29:59.327
All right.

00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:06.790
Now what I'm basically depending
on is note, there's

00:30:06.790 --> 00:30:16.850
a one-to-one map between
code words y and

00:30:16.850 --> 00:30:20.370
c and trellis paths.

00:30:25.610 --> 00:30:30.710
For this specific trellis up
here, how many paths are there

00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:31.960
through the trellis?

00:30:37.118 --> 00:30:40.590
Do you see that however I go
through the trellis, I'm going

00:30:40.590 --> 00:30:44.132
to meet four two-way branches?

00:30:44.132 --> 00:30:44.660
All right?

00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:45.790
According to [UNINTELLIGIBLE],
there

00:30:45.790 --> 00:30:48.210
are four yes-no questions.

00:30:48.210 --> 00:30:49.330
It's a binary tree.

00:30:49.330 --> 00:30:52.970
So there are 16 possible ways
to get through this trellis

00:30:52.970 --> 00:30:58.920
from start to finish, if I view
it as a maze problem.

00:30:58.920 --> 00:30:59.890
And they correspond --

00:30:59.890 --> 00:31:01.720
I haven't labeled all
the branche --

00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:06.270
but they do correspond to all
16 words in this block code.

00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:13.440
So now what is maximum
likely decoding?

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:19.330
I want to find the one of those
16 words that has the

00:31:19.330 --> 00:31:25.120
greatest likelihood, or the
least negative log likelihood,

00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:31.355
over all of these 12 received
symbols or 6 received times.

00:31:34.750 --> 00:31:36.180
So what will that be?

00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:39.310
Once I've labeled each of these
branches with a log

00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:44.290
likelihood cost, I simply want
to find the least cost path

00:31:44.290 --> 00:31:45.890
through this trellis.

00:31:45.890 --> 00:31:50.690
And that will correspond to
the most likely code word.

00:31:50.690 --> 00:31:52.160
This is the essence of it.

00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:53.610
Do you all see that?

00:31:53.610 --> 00:31:54.860
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:57.110 --> 00:32:00.220
PROFESSOR: The independent
transmission allows me to

00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:05.590
break it up into a
symbol-by-symbol or

00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:07.680
time-by-time expression.

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:12.830
So I can simply cumulate over
this sum right here.

00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:15.550
And I'm just looking for the
minimum sum over all the

00:32:15.550 --> 00:32:17.470
possible ways I could get
through this trellis.

00:32:20.910 --> 00:32:31.120
So now we translated this into
finding the minimum cost path

00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:33.670
through a graph.

00:32:33.670 --> 00:32:37.410
Through a graph with a very
special structure, nice

00:32:37.410 --> 00:32:38.660
regular structure.

00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:45.540
OK.

00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:50.350
Once you've got that, then I
think it's very obvious how to

00:32:50.350 --> 00:32:55.600
come up with a nice recursive
algorithm for doing that.

00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:56.945
Here's my recursive algorithm.

00:33:03.170 --> 00:33:05.520
I'm going to start computing
weights.

00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:07.315
I'm going to start here.

00:33:07.315 --> 00:33:11.070
I'm going to assign
weight zero here.

00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:16.200
Right here I'm going to assign a
weight which is equal to the

00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:20.720
cost of the best path to get
to that node in the graph.

00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:24.340
In this case, it's just the
cost of that branch.

00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:26.250
Similarly down here.

00:33:26.250 --> 00:33:28.770
Similarly I proceed
to these four.

00:33:28.770 --> 00:33:32.040
There's only one way to get to
each of these four, and I

00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:37.900
simply add up what the
total weight is.

00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:40.750
Now here's the first point where
it gets interesting,

00:33:40.750 --> 00:33:45.260
where I have two possible ways
to get to this node.

00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:49.450
One way is via these three
branches, and that has a

00:33:49.450 --> 00:33:50.390
certain cost.

00:33:50.390 --> 00:33:53.330
Another way is via these three
branches, and that has a

00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:55.840
certain cost.

00:33:55.840 --> 00:34:00.680
Suppose the cost of these three
branches is higher than

00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:02.540
the cost of these
three branches.

00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:04.722
Just pair-wise.

00:34:04.722 --> 00:34:06.690
All right?

00:34:06.690 --> 00:34:12.710
Claim that I can pick the
minimum cost path to this

00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:19.800
node, throw away the other
possibility, and I can never

00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:22.489
have thrown away something which
itself is part of the

00:34:22.489 --> 00:34:24.530
minimum cost path through
the whole trellis.

00:34:27.610 --> 00:34:29.520
Clearly.

00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:34.480
Suppose this is the best
path from here to here.

00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:36.015
This is worse.

00:34:36.015 --> 00:34:41.590
X, X, X, X X. And now I find the
minimum cost path through

00:34:41.590 --> 00:34:44.679
the whole trellis goes
through this node.

00:34:44.679 --> 00:34:48.900
Say it's like that.

00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:51.730
Could it have started
with this?

00:34:51.730 --> 00:34:52.310
No.

00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:55.870
Because I can always replace
this with a path that starts

00:34:55.870 --> 00:34:59.130
with that and get
a better path.

00:34:59.130 --> 00:35:02.880
So at this point, I can make a
decision between all the paths

00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:05.400
that get to that node
and pick just one.

00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:07.850
The best one that gets
to that node.

00:35:07.850 --> 00:35:10.270
And that's called
the survivor.

00:35:10.270 --> 00:35:14.793
This is really the key concept
that Viterbi introduced.

00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:21.200
We only need to say one, the
best up to that time.

00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:25.780
We need to do it for all the
2 to the nu possibilities.

00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:32.772
So we have 2 to the nu survivors
at time k or time i,

00:35:32.772 --> 00:35:34.300
whatever your time index is.

00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:38.020
Used k for something else.

00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:38.490
OK.

00:35:38.490 --> 00:35:43.260
So I can throw away half
the possibilities.

00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:47.010
Now each survivor, I remember
what its past history is, and

00:35:47.010 --> 00:35:50.830
I remember what its cost
is to that point.

00:35:50.830 --> 00:35:55.310
Now to proceed, the recursion
is to proceed one time unit

00:35:55.310 --> 00:36:00.130
ahead, to add the incremental
cost -- say, to make a

00:36:00.130 --> 00:36:02.830
decision here, I need to add
the incremental cost to the

00:36:02.830 --> 00:36:05.830
two survivors that were
here and here.

00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:08.670
So I add an incremental cost,
according to what these

00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:10.500
branches are labeled with.

00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:15.890
And now I find the best of these
two possibilities to get

00:36:15.890 --> 00:36:17.990
to this node.

00:36:17.990 --> 00:36:28.770
So the recursion is called an
ACS operation for add, we add

00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:32.550
increments to each of these
paths, we compare which is the

00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:35.040
best, and we select
the best one.

00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:35.830
We keep that.

00:36:35.830 --> 00:36:36.930
We throw away the other.

00:36:36.930 --> 00:36:43.570
We now have a one unit longer
best path to this node and its

00:36:43.570 --> 00:36:51.770
cost for all 2 the nu survivors
at time i plus 1.

00:36:51.770 --> 00:36:56.670
And just proceeding in that way,
we go through until we

00:36:56.670 --> 00:36:59.210
finally get to the
terminating node.

00:36:59.210 --> 00:37:03.410
And at this point, when we've
found the best path to this

00:37:03.410 --> 00:37:05.000
node, we've found the best path

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:08.320
through the whole trellis.

00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:08.610
OK?

00:37:08.610 --> 00:37:10.566
So that's all it is.

00:37:10.566 --> 00:37:15.890
I believe it's just totally
obvious once you reduce it to

00:37:15.890 --> 00:37:22.260
a search for a minimum cost
path through the trellis.

00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:26.125
It's very well suited to the
application of convolutional

00:37:26.125 --> 00:37:29.390
codes, because we really are
thinking of sending these bits

00:37:29.390 --> 00:37:31.190
as a stream in time.

00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:34.210
And at the receiver, you can
think of just proceeding

00:37:34.210 --> 00:37:39.150
forward one unit of time, 2 to
the nu, add, compare, selects,

00:37:39.150 --> 00:37:40.680
and we've got a new
set of survivors.

00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:45.030
There are nice implications of
this that involve, you can

00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:48.570
build a computer for every
node or for every pair of

00:37:48.570 --> 00:37:53.080
nodes to do the ACS operation,
make a very fast recursion

00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:55.900
through here.

00:37:55.900 --> 00:37:56.710
So that's it.

00:37:56.710 --> 00:37:59.740
That's the Viterbi algorithm
for terminated

00:37:59.740 --> 00:38:00.990
convolutional codes.

00:38:06.690 --> 00:38:10.175
Now let's ask about the
VIterbi algorithm for

00:38:10.175 --> 00:38:12.270
unterminated convolutional
codes.

00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:23.695
Suppose this trellis
becomes very long.

00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:27.930
Across the whole page.

00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:33.760
What are these survivors
going to look like?

00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:38.620
Suppose we start from a definite
node here, and we've

00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:42.140
got a four state convolutional
code, and we iterate and we

00:38:42.140 --> 00:38:45.730
iterate and we iterate with
the Viterbi algorithm.

00:38:45.730 --> 00:38:48.800
After a long time, somewhere out
here, we're going to have

00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:55.150
four survivors and
their histories.

00:38:55.150 --> 00:38:58.860
And I've greatly simplified,
but basically the histories

00:38:58.860 --> 00:39:03.960
are going to look schematically
something --

00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:06.300
I don't know -- could
be anything.

00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:07.550
Look like this.

00:39:10.830 --> 00:39:14.770
The point I'm illustrating here
is that the histories

00:39:14.770 --> 00:39:17.090
will be distinct right
at this time.

00:39:17.090 --> 00:39:18.160
They have to be, because
they're going to

00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:19.220
four distinct stages.

00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:22.050
But as you go backwards in
time, you will find they

00:39:22.050 --> 00:39:26.750
merge, any two histories will
merge, at a certain time back.

00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:28.300
And this is a probablistic
thing.

00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:31.640
It depends on what's happening
on the channel and so forth.

00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:36.240
But with high probability, they
will have merged not too

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:39.740
far back in time.

00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:44.120
So even if we never get to a
final node, even if we just

00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:48.210
let this process continue
forever, at this point we can

00:39:48.210 --> 00:39:53.440
say, we can make a definite
decision at this time.

00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:53.720
Right?

00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:56.830
Because all survivors
start with a common

00:39:56.830 --> 00:40:00.780
initial part, up to here.

00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:03.690
So one way to operate the
Viterbi algorithm would be

00:40:03.690 --> 00:40:06.690
just to, at this
point, say, OK.

00:40:06.690 --> 00:40:10.340
I'm going to put out everything
before this time.

00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:12.890
No matter how long I run the
decoder, the first part of it

00:40:12.890 --> 00:40:14.380
is always going to
be this part.

00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:17.480
So these are definitely decided
up to this time.

00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:19.700
And then I still don't
know about here.

00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:22.120
I'm going to have to go
a little bit further.

00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:27.540
You proceed further, and after
a while, you find more that's

00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:29.120
definitely done.

00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:32.950
In practice, that would lead
to a sporadic output rate.

00:40:32.950 --> 00:40:34.660
That isn't really
what you want.

00:40:34.660 --> 00:40:40.230
So in practice what you do is
you establish a decision

00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:48.500
delay, delta.

00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:55.290
And what you put out is you hope
that 99.999% of the time,

00:40:55.290 --> 00:40:59.330
that if you look back delta on
all the survivors, they will

00:40:59.330 --> 00:41:02.430
all be a common path,
delta back here.

00:41:02.430 --> 00:41:04.460
So there's a very
high probability

00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:06.460
you will have converged.

00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:10.240
And so simply at this time, you
put out what you decided

00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:11.800
on delta time units earlier.

00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:14.090
Next time you put out
the next one.

00:41:14.090 --> 00:41:15.550
Next time you put out
the next one.

00:41:15.550 --> 00:41:18.490
So you get a nice, regular,
synchronous stream of data

00:41:18.490 --> 00:41:19.830
coming out of here.

00:41:19.830 --> 00:41:24.380
Every so often, it may happen
that you get out to here and

00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:27.220
you still haven't
made a decision.

00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:29.420
Then you have to do something.

00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:34.010
And it really doesn't matter
terribly much what you do.

00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:38.430
You might pick the guy who has
the best metric at this time,

00:41:38.430 --> 00:41:40.740
or you simply might say, well,
I'm always going to pick the

00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:42.130
one that goes to all zeros.

00:41:42.130 --> 00:41:43.800
That wouldn't be symmetric.

00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:48.120
You can make any decision
you like.

00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:50.640
And you could be wrong.

00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:53.780
But you pick delta large enough
so that the probability

00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:57.340
of this happening is very rare,
and this just adds a

00:41:57.340 --> 00:42:00.340
little bit to your error
probability, and as long as

00:42:00.340 --> 00:42:02.620
the probability of making an
error because of this kind of

00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:06.270
operation is much lower than
your probability of making an

00:42:06.270 --> 00:42:09.410
ordinary decoding error, then
you're going to be OK.

00:42:12.050 --> 00:42:16.140
For convolutional codes way back
at the beginning of time,

00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:21.370
people decided that a decision
delay a 5 times nu, 5 times

00:42:21.370 --> 00:42:25.870
the constraint length, was
the right rule of thumb.

00:42:25.870 --> 00:42:28.770
And that's been the rule of
thumb for rate 1/n codes

00:42:28.770 --> 00:42:30.470
forever after.

00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:35.510
The point is, delta should
be a lot more than nu.

00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:38.180
You know, after one constraint
length, you certainly won't

00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:39.610
have converged.

00:42:39.610 --> 00:42:41.580
After five constraint lengths,
you're highly

00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:43.410
likely to have converged.

00:42:43.410 --> 00:42:49.960
And theoretically, the
probability of not converging

00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:51.960
goes down exponentially
with delta.

00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:55.210
So big enough is
going to work.

00:42:55.210 --> 00:42:58.460
And a final point is that
sometimes, you really care

00:42:58.460 --> 00:43:01.930
that what you put out to
be a true code word.

00:43:01.930 --> 00:43:05.200
In that case, if you get to this
situation, you have to

00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:09.500
make a choice, you make a choice
here, then you have to

00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:13.340
actually eliminate all the
survivors that are not

00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:15.980
consistent with that choice.

00:43:15.980 --> 00:43:20.490
And you can do that simply by
putting an infinite metric on

00:43:20.490 --> 00:43:21.890
this guy here.

00:43:21.890 --> 00:43:25.270
Then he'll get wiped out as
soon as he's compared with

00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:26.520
anybody else.

00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:30.830
And that will ensure that
whatever you eventually put

00:43:30.830 --> 00:43:34.950
out, you keep the
sequence being a

00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:36.070
legitimate code sequence.

00:43:36.070 --> 00:43:39.220
So that's a very fine point.

00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:39.680
OK.

00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:44.200
So there really isn't any
serious problem with letting

00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:47.540
the Viterbi algorithm run
indefinitely in time once

00:43:47.540 --> 00:43:49.870
you've got it started.

00:43:49.870 --> 00:43:50.930
How do you get it started?

00:43:50.930 --> 00:43:57.620
Suppose you came online and
you simply had a stream of

00:43:57.620 --> 00:44:00.810
outputs, transmitted from a
convolutional code over a

00:44:00.810 --> 00:44:03.930
channel, and you didn't know
what state to start in.

00:44:03.930 --> 00:44:07.441
How do you use synchronize
to a starting state?

00:44:07.441 --> 00:44:10.400
Well, this is not hard either.

00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:14.350
Basically you start, you're in
one of four states, or 2 to

00:44:14.350 --> 00:44:15.060
the nu states.

00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:16.840
You don't know which one.

00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:23.250
Let's just give them all cost
0 and start decoding, using

00:44:23.250 --> 00:44:26.960
the four state trellis.

00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:33.160
And we just start receiving
2-tuples from here on.

00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:36.190
We get rk, r k plus
1, and so forth.

00:44:36.190 --> 00:44:37.150
So how should we start?

00:44:37.150 --> 00:44:38.290
Well, we'll just start
like that.

00:44:38.290 --> 00:44:41.180
And we get sort of the mirror
image of this --

00:44:41.180 --> 00:44:51.900
that after a time, these will
all converge to a single path.

00:44:51.900 --> 00:44:55.310
Or after a time, when we're way
down here, this is what

00:44:55.310 --> 00:44:58.300
the situation will look like.

00:44:58.300 --> 00:45:01.600
These things will each have a
different route over here, but

00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:03.670
they will have converged
in here.

00:45:03.670 --> 00:45:06.710
There will be a long path over
which they're all converged,

00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:10.560
and then towards the end,
they'll be unrooted again.

00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:10.890
OK.

00:45:10.890 --> 00:45:11.540
Well, that's fine.

00:45:11.540 --> 00:45:12.730
What does that mean
in practice?

00:45:12.730 --> 00:45:18.190
That means we make errors during
the synchronization.

00:45:21.810 --> 00:45:27.800
But we say we're synchronized
when we get this case where

00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:30.990
all the paths going to all the
current survivors have a

00:45:30.990 --> 00:45:33.820
common central stage.

00:45:33.820 --> 00:45:36.710
And how long does it take
to synchronize?

00:45:36.710 --> 00:45:41.540
Again, by analysis, it's exactly
this same delta again.

00:45:41.540 --> 00:45:45.720
The probability of not being
synchronized after delta goes

00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:48.130
down exponentially with delta
in exactly the same way.

00:45:48.130 --> 00:45:50.940
It's just a mirror image from
one end to the other.

00:45:50.940 --> 00:45:54.930
So from a practical point of
view, this is no problem.

00:45:54.930 --> 00:45:57.750
And just starting the Viterbi
decoder up, with arbitrary

00:45:57.750 --> 00:46:02.330
metrics here, and after five
constraint lengths, if you

00:46:02.330 --> 00:46:05.460
like, it's highly likely to
have gotten synchronized.

00:46:05.460 --> 00:46:07.880
You'll make errors for five
constraint lengths and after

00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:10.956
that, you'll be OK, as though
you knew the starting state.

00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:21.030
So the moral is, no problem.

00:46:21.030 --> 00:46:23.510
You can just set up the Viterbi

00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:24.760
algorithm and let it run.

00:46:31.330 --> 00:46:36.110
The costs will all, of course,
increase without bound, which

00:46:36.110 --> 00:46:36.570
is [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:46:36.570 --> 00:46:40.110
You can always renormalize them,
subtract a common cost

00:46:40.110 --> 00:46:40.810
from all of them.

00:46:40.810 --> 00:46:42.490
That won't change anything.

00:46:42.490 --> 00:46:43.820
Keep them within running time.

00:46:43.820 --> 00:46:49.410
So we don't need to terminate
convolutional codes in order

00:46:49.410 --> 00:46:50.620
to run the Viterbi algorithm.

00:46:50.620 --> 00:46:54.470
We just let it self-synchronize
and we make

00:46:54.470 --> 00:46:57.180
decisions with some
decision delay.

00:46:57.180 --> 00:47:00.290
And the additional problems
that we have

00:47:00.290 --> 00:47:03.220
are very, very small.

00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:05.070
There are no additional
problems.

00:47:05.070 --> 00:47:05.561
Yeah?

00:47:05.561 --> 00:47:06.811
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:16.560
PROFESSOR: At this point?

00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:19.220
Well, notice that we don't know
that we've synchronized

00:47:19.220 --> 00:47:21.905
until we've continued further,
and we've got --

00:47:21.905 --> 00:47:25.420
you know, where we've really
synchronized is when we see

00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:28.730
that every survivor path
has the common root.

00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:37.490
So at that point, there is
really only one path here.

00:47:37.490 --> 00:47:40.930
And we can say that the
synchronized part is

00:47:40.930 --> 00:47:42.180
definitely decoded.

00:47:44.450 --> 00:47:47.420
And we can't really say too
much about this out here,

00:47:47.420 --> 00:47:50.660
because this depends on what's
happened out in the past.

00:47:50.660 --> 00:47:56.080
So you say this is erasures,
if you like.

00:47:56.080 --> 00:47:59.550
The stuff that we're pretty sure
has a high probability of

00:47:59.550 --> 00:48:00.220
being wrong.

00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:01.470
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:05.570 --> 00:48:08.740
PROFESSOR: There is
only one decoded

00:48:08.740 --> 00:48:12.407
path during this interval.

00:48:12.407 --> 00:48:13.676
AUDIENCE: But before that
interval there are branches

00:48:13.676 --> 00:48:14.926
and so on right.

00:48:17.310 --> 00:48:19.800
PROFESSOR: Well here, we
don't know anything.

00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:23.930
Here we know the results
of one computation.

00:48:23.930 --> 00:48:24.810
What are you suggesting?

00:48:24.810 --> 00:48:26.410
Just pick the best one
at that point?

00:48:26.410 --> 00:48:29.254
AUDIENCE: And finally after
you reach the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:34.800
PROFESSOR: And finally?

00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:36.960
I'm just not sure
exactly what the

00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:38.680
logic is of your algorithm.

00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:40.730
It's clear for this, it wouldn't
make any difference

00:48:40.730 --> 00:48:42.730
if we just started off
arbitrarily so, we're going to

00:48:42.730 --> 00:48:44.820
start in the zero state.

00:48:44.820 --> 00:48:48.110
And we only allow things to
start in the zero state.

00:48:48.110 --> 00:48:51.210
Well, we'll eventually get
to this path anyway.

00:48:51.210 --> 00:48:53.820
So it really doesn't matter
how you start.

00:48:53.820 --> 00:48:55.500
You're going to have garbage for
a while, and then you're

00:48:55.500 --> 00:48:56.750
going to be OK.

00:48:58.510 --> 00:48:59.910
There's no point in doing
anything more

00:48:59.910 --> 00:49:01.160
sophisticated than that.

00:49:08.610 --> 00:49:11.500
I don't want to discuss what
you're suggesting, because I

00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:14.210
think there's a flaw in it.

00:49:14.210 --> 00:49:16.040
Try to figure out what time
you're going to make this

00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:17.290
decision at.

00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:20.655
OK.

00:49:20.655 --> 00:49:24.720
Do we all understand the
Viterbi algorithm?

00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:25.570
Yes?

00:49:25.570 --> 00:49:26.740
Good.

00:49:26.740 --> 00:49:28.720
We can easily program it up.

00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:31.776
There will be an exercise
on the homework.

00:49:34.330 --> 00:49:37.110
But now you can all do the
Viterbi algorithm.

00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:40.330
All right.

00:49:40.330 --> 00:49:40.980
So --

00:49:40.980 --> 00:49:41.900
and oh.

00:49:41.900 --> 00:49:44.027
What's the complexity of
the Viterbi algorithm?

00:49:51.190 --> 00:49:54.910
What is the complexity?

00:49:54.910 --> 00:49:57.530
We always want to be talking
about performance versus

00:49:57.530 --> 00:49:58.780
complexity.

00:50:00.860 --> 00:50:03.520
So it's a recursive algorithm.

00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:08.180
We do exactly the same
operations every unit of time.

00:50:08.180 --> 00:50:09.990
What do the operations
consist of?

00:50:09.990 --> 00:50:13.380
They consist of add,
compare, select.

00:50:13.380 --> 00:50:16.260
How many additions to
we have to make?

00:50:16.260 --> 00:50:19.270
Additions are basically equal
to the number of branches in

00:50:19.270 --> 00:50:22.520
each unit of time in the
trellis, which is 2

00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:23.565
to the nu plus one.

00:50:23.565 --> 00:50:24.485
Is that clear?

00:50:24.485 --> 00:50:26.280
We have 2 to the nu states.

00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:29.670
Two branches out of, two
branches into each state,

00:50:29.670 --> 00:50:31.250
always for rate one.

00:50:31.250 --> 00:50:38.100
So we have 2 to the nu
plus 1 additions.

00:50:38.100 --> 00:50:43.520
We get 2 the nu compares,
one for each state.

00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:46.575
Which is really, you can
consider the select to be part

00:50:46.575 --> 00:50:48.780
of the compare.

00:50:48.780 --> 00:50:55.510
Overall, you can say the
complexity is of the order of

00:50:55.510 --> 00:50:58.420
2 to the nu or 2 to
the nu plus 1.

00:51:02.030 --> 00:51:06.660
This is the number of states
or the state complexity.

00:51:06.660 --> 00:51:07.950
This is the number
of branches.

00:51:11.410 --> 00:51:14.490
I will argue a little bit
later that the branch

00:51:14.490 --> 00:51:16.470
complexity is really
more fundamental.

00:51:16.470 --> 00:51:20.610
You've got to do at least one
thing for each branch.

00:51:20.610 --> 00:51:24.130
So in different set up,
the branch complexity.

00:51:24.130 --> 00:51:28.870
But these are practically the
same thing, and so we say that

00:51:28.870 --> 00:51:33.030
the complexity of the Viterbi
algorithm is basically like

00:51:33.030 --> 00:51:33.950
the number of states.

00:51:33.950 --> 00:51:37.220
We have a four state encoder,
the complexity's like four, it

00:51:37.220 --> 00:51:39.970
goes up exponentially with
the constraint length.

00:51:39.970 --> 00:51:43.700
This says, this is going to be
nice, as long as we have short

00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:45.010
constraint length.

00:51:45.010 --> 00:51:48.020
For longer constraint lengths,
you know, a constraint length

00:51:48.020 --> 00:51:51.720
20, it's going to be a pretty
horrible algorithm.

00:51:51.720 --> 00:51:55.390
So we can only use the Viterbi
algorithm relatively short

00:51:55.390 --> 00:51:58.390
constraint length codes,
relatively

00:51:58.390 --> 00:52:01.080
small numbers of states.

00:52:01.080 --> 00:52:03.990
The biggest Viterbi algorithm
that I'm aware has ever been

00:52:03.990 --> 00:52:07.270
built is a 2 the 14th
state algorithm.

00:52:07.270 --> 00:52:10.360
The so-called big Viterbi
decoder out at JPL.

00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:13.050
It was used for the Galileo
space missions.

00:52:13.050 --> 00:52:14.440
It's in a rack that big.

00:52:14.440 --> 00:52:17.460
I'm sure nowadays you could
practically get it on a chip,

00:52:17.460 --> 00:52:20.690
and you could maybe do
2 the 20th states.

00:52:20.690 --> 00:52:28.510
But so this exponential
complexity, in computer

00:52:28.510 --> 00:52:31.970
science terms, not really
what we want.

00:52:31.970 --> 00:52:36.230
But when we're talking about
moderate complexity decoders,

00:52:36.230 --> 00:52:40.290
these really have proved to be
the most effective, and become

00:52:40.290 --> 00:52:43.590
the standard moderate
complexity decoder.

00:52:43.590 --> 00:52:46.500
The advantage is that we can
do true maximum likelihood

00:52:46.500 --> 00:52:52.370
decoding on a sequence basis,
using soft decisions, using

00:52:52.370 --> 00:52:54.910
whatever reliability information
the channel has,

00:52:54.910 --> 00:52:58.270
as long as it's memoryless.

00:52:58.270 --> 00:53:03.550
So last topic is to talk
about performance.

00:53:03.550 --> 00:53:06.170
How are we going to evaluate
the performance of

00:53:06.170 --> 00:53:08.200
convolutional codes?

00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:11.120
You remember what we
did on block codes?

00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:15.650
We basically looked at the
pairwise error probability

00:53:15.650 --> 00:53:19.120
between block code words, we
then did the union bound,

00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:25.360
based on the pairwise
error probabilities.

00:53:25.360 --> 00:53:28.590
And we observed that the union
bound was typically dominated

00:53:28.590 --> 00:53:31.370
by the minimum distance error
events, and so we get the

00:53:31.370 --> 00:53:34.700
union bound estimate, which
was purely based on the

00:53:34.700 --> 00:53:38.620
minimum distance possible
errors.

00:53:38.620 --> 00:53:41.050
And we can do exactly the
same thing in the

00:53:41.050 --> 00:53:42.700
convolutional case.

00:53:42.700 --> 00:53:45.530
Convolutional case, again,
is a linear code.

00:53:45.530 --> 00:53:49.310
That means it has the group
property, has symmetry such

00:53:49.310 --> 00:53:53.180
that the distances from every
possible code sequence to all

00:53:53.180 --> 00:53:57.390
other code sequences are going
to be the same, since we're

00:53:57.390 --> 00:54:02.730
talking on a long or possibly
infinite sequence basis.

00:54:02.730 --> 00:54:07.840
And we need to be just a little
bit more careful about

00:54:07.840 --> 00:54:09.420
what an error consists of.

00:54:09.420 --> 00:54:13.850
We need to talk about
error events.

00:54:13.850 --> 00:54:16.622
And this is a simple concept.

00:54:16.622 --> 00:54:22.970
Let us again draw a path
corresponding to the

00:54:22.970 --> 00:54:27.380
transmitted code words.

00:54:27.380 --> 00:54:32.460
A very long path, potentially
infinite, but it is some

00:54:32.460 --> 00:54:34.930
definite sequence.

00:54:34.930 --> 00:54:38.520
And let's run it through a
memory list channel, use the

00:54:38.520 --> 00:54:42.270
Viterbi algorithm, and we're
going to get some received

00:54:42.270 --> 00:54:45.336
code word, or decoded
code word.

00:54:51.170 --> 00:54:54.200
This is one place where you
might want to insist that the

00:54:54.200 --> 00:54:57.650
Viterbi algorithm actually
put out a code word.

00:54:57.650 --> 00:55:00.170
What is that going
to look like?

00:55:00.170 --> 00:55:02.660
Well, if you're running
normally, the received code

00:55:02.660 --> 00:55:04.850
word is going to equal
the transmitted code

00:55:04.850 --> 00:55:06.870
word most the time.

00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:08.750
Except it's going
to make errors.

00:55:08.750 --> 00:55:10.070
And what will the errors
look like?

00:55:10.070 --> 00:55:14.090
They'll look like a branch off
through the trellis, and then

00:55:14.090 --> 00:55:18.486
eventually a reemerging
into the same state.

00:55:18.486 --> 00:55:21.110
And similarly, you go on longer,
and you might have

00:55:21.110 --> 00:55:23.930
another error.

00:55:23.930 --> 00:55:26.276
And any place where there's
a difference --

00:55:28.786 --> 00:55:31.410
should have done a different
color here --

00:55:31.410 --> 00:55:33.470
any place where there's
difference, this is called an

00:55:33.470 --> 00:55:34.720
error event.

00:55:36.950 --> 00:55:40.720
So what I'm illustrating is a
case when we had two disjoint

00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:42.740
error events.

00:55:42.740 --> 00:55:45.500
Is that concept clear?

00:55:45.500 --> 00:55:47.670
We're going to draw the trellis
paths corresponding

00:55:47.670 --> 00:55:52.100
the transmitted code word and
the decoded code word.

00:55:52.100 --> 00:55:55.850
Wherever they diverge over a
period of time, we're going to

00:55:55.850 --> 00:55:56.990
call it an error event.

00:55:56.990 --> 00:56:00.530
But eventually they will
re-merge again.

00:56:00.530 --> 00:56:03.510
So it could be a short time.

00:56:03.510 --> 00:56:07.060
Can't be any shorter than the
constraint length plus 1.

00:56:07.060 --> 00:56:09.040
That would be the minimum
length error event.

00:56:09.040 --> 00:56:11.010
Could be a longer time.

00:56:11.010 --> 00:56:12.260
Unbounded, actually.

00:56:15.470 --> 00:56:16.870
OK.

00:56:16.870 --> 00:56:21.870
What is going to be the
probability of an error event

00:56:21.870 --> 00:56:23.290
starting at some time?

00:56:37.340 --> 00:56:41.680
And when I say an error event
starting at time k, let's

00:56:41.680 --> 00:56:44.180
suppose I've been going along
on the transmitted path, and

00:56:44.180 --> 00:56:48.690
the decoder has still
got that there.

00:56:48.690 --> 00:56:50.660
I'm asking, what is the
probability that this code

00:56:50.660 --> 00:56:54.590
word is actually more likely
on a maximum likelihood

00:56:54.590 --> 00:56:58.190
sequence detection basis
than this one?

00:56:58.190 --> 00:57:00.980
Well, simply the probability
that the received sequence is

00:57:00.980 --> 00:57:04.710
closer to this one
than this one.

00:57:04.710 --> 00:57:09.530
We know how to analyze that
for a finite differences.

00:57:09.530 --> 00:57:12.850
What is the difference here?

00:57:12.850 --> 00:57:22.030
The difference, call this y
of d and this y hat of d.

00:57:22.030 --> 00:57:26.240
What is y of d minus
y hat of d?

00:57:26.240 --> 00:57:30.980
We'll call that e of d.

00:57:30.980 --> 00:57:32.390
This is a code word.

00:57:32.390 --> 00:57:34.300
This is a decoded code word.

00:57:34.300 --> 00:57:38.400
So the error event has
to be a code word.

00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:39.650
Right?

00:57:41.210 --> 00:57:42.855
Decoder made a mistake.

00:57:42.855 --> 00:57:46.160
The mistake has to
be a code word.

00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:53.840
So we're asking, what is the
probability that y of d sent y

00:57:53.840 --> 00:58:01.300
hat of d decoded, where
y hat of d equals y

00:58:01.300 --> 00:58:03.945
of d plus e of d?

00:58:03.945 --> 00:58:08.880
We'll just ask for that
particular event.

00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:20.830
This is the probability that
r of d closer to y hat

00:58:20.830 --> 00:58:23.707
of d than y of d.

00:58:28.680 --> 00:58:30.260
Now, making a big leap.

00:58:34.030 --> 00:58:37.500
This is equal to --

00:58:37.500 --> 00:58:41.790
we're just talking about two
sequences in Euclidean space.

00:58:41.790 --> 00:58:43.130
All that matters is
the Euclidean

00:58:43.130 --> 00:58:45.320
distance between them.

00:58:45.320 --> 00:58:47.870
What is the Euclidean distance
between them?

00:58:47.870 --> 00:58:51.930
It's 4 alpha squared times the
weight of this error event,

00:58:51.930 --> 00:58:53.180
the Hamming weight of
this error event.

00:58:56.290 --> 00:59:00.050
And so if you remember how to
calculate pairwise error

00:59:00.050 --> 00:59:05.540
probabilities, this is just
alpha squared D over sigma

00:59:05.540 --> 00:59:11.950
squared, where D is the
distance of e of d.

00:59:11.950 --> 00:59:18.054
The weight, the Hamming
weight of e of d.

00:59:18.054 --> 00:59:20.040
Call it sigma squared.

00:59:20.040 --> 00:59:21.390
Remember something that
looked like that?

00:59:25.100 --> 00:59:28.550
So once again, we go from the
Hamming weight of a possible

00:59:28.550 --> 00:59:32.450
error event to a Euclidean
weight, which is 4 alpha

00:59:32.450 --> 00:59:35.940
squared times the
Hamming weight.

00:59:35.940 --> 00:59:40.190
We actually take the square root
of that and we only need

00:59:40.190 --> 00:59:45.190
to make an error, a noise
of half of that length.

00:59:45.190 --> 00:59:48.250
So that's where the
4 disappears.

00:59:48.250 --> 00:59:53.040
And we just get q of d squared
over sigma squared, where d is

00:59:53.040 --> 00:59:56.550
the distance to the
decision boundary.

00:59:56.550 --> 01:00:01.520
Compressing a lot of steps,
but it's all something you

01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:06.110
felt you knew well a
few chapters ago.

01:00:06.110 --> 01:00:16.680
So the union bound would simply
be the sum over all

01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:22.920
error events in the code
such that the start --

01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:25.010
so e of d is --

01:00:25.010 --> 01:00:27.330
you want them to start
at time 0, say.

01:00:27.330 --> 01:00:29.970
Let's ask for the probably
of an error event

01:00:29.970 --> 01:00:32.950
starting at time 0.

01:00:32.950 --> 01:00:37.590
So we want it to be polynomial,
have no non-zero

01:00:37.590 --> 01:00:41.310
negative coefficients, and have
the coefficient at time 0

01:00:41.310 --> 01:00:46.300
be 1, or not 0.

01:00:46.300 --> 01:00:49.346
I'm doing this very roughly.

01:00:49.346 --> 01:00:55.220
Of q to the square root of alpha
squared times the weight

01:00:55.220 --> 01:00:58.920
Hamming of e of d over
sigma squared.

01:01:02.390 --> 01:01:03.350
Just as before.

01:01:03.350 --> 01:01:07.540
So to get the union bound, we
sum up over the weights of all

01:01:07.540 --> 01:01:11.350
sequences that start
at time 0.

01:01:11.350 --> 01:01:15.916
Let's do it for our
favorite example.

01:01:15.916 --> 01:01:22.630
Suppose g of d is 1 plus d
squared, 1 plus d plus d

01:01:22.630 --> 01:01:27.550
squared, then what are the
possible e of d's that I'm

01:01:27.550 --> 01:01:28.380
talking about?

01:01:28.380 --> 01:01:31.370
I have this itself.

01:01:31.370 --> 01:01:34.390
1 plus d squared, 1 plus
d plus d squared.

01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:38.850
This is weight equal to 5.

01:01:38.850 --> 01:01:41.000
What's my next possible
error event?

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.860
Would be 1 plus d times this.

01:01:43.860 --> 01:01:50.740
So it's going to be a table.

01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:56.570
We have g of d, 1 plus d times
g of d, which is equal to 1

01:01:56.570 --> 01:02:02.320
plus d plus d squared plus d
cubed, 1 plus d cubed, that

01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:05.290
has weight equals 6.

01:02:05.290 --> 01:02:07.520
What's my next longer one?

01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:16.010
1 plus d squared times g of d
equals 1 plus d fourth, 1 plus

01:02:16.010 --> 01:02:22.380
d plus d third plus d fourth,
that has weight 6.

01:02:22.380 --> 01:02:26.370
1 plus d plus d squared
times g of d.

01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:32.420
1 plus d plus --

01:02:32.420 --> 01:02:35.180
this is 1 plus d plus --

01:02:42.370 --> 01:02:45.710
plus d third, plus d forth.

01:02:45.710 --> 01:02:47.620
I may be making a
mistake here.

01:02:47.620 --> 01:02:51.890
1 plus d squared
plus d fourth.

01:02:51.890 --> 01:02:54.550
It's hard to do this by
hand after a while.

01:02:54.550 --> 01:02:56.190
OK.

01:02:56.190 --> 01:02:59.450
Notice, we start tabulating all
the error events, which I

01:02:59.450 --> 01:03:04.730
can do in order of the degree of
u of d, always keeping the

01:03:04.730 --> 01:03:09.120
non-zero, the time 0
term equal to 1.

01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:10.910
So this is the only
one of length 1.

01:03:10.910 --> 01:03:12.035
This is [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

01:03:12.035 --> 01:03:14.270
of degree 0.

01:03:14.270 --> 01:03:15.730
This is the only one
of degree 1.

01:03:15.730 --> 01:03:17.170
There are two of them
of degree 2.

01:03:17.170 --> 01:03:21.330
There will be four of them of
degree 3, and so forth.

01:03:21.330 --> 01:03:25.870
So I can lay out what all the
error events could be, and I

01:03:25.870 --> 01:03:27.720
look at what their
weights are.

01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:30.060
Here's my minimum weight
error event.

01:03:30.060 --> 01:03:32.260
Then I have two of weight
six and so forth.

01:03:32.260 --> 01:03:35.920
So the union bound, I'd be
adding up this term.

01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:40.080
I'd get one term where the
weight is 5, two where the

01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:44.200
weight is 6, I don't know how
many where the weight is 7.

01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:46.380
I happen to know there
were only two

01:03:46.380 --> 01:03:48.190
weight 6 error events.

01:03:48.190 --> 01:03:51.890
And you simply have to find out
what the weight profile is

01:03:51.890 --> 01:03:53.840
and put it in the union bound.

01:03:53.840 --> 01:04:00.470
Or you can use the union bound
estimate, which is simply --

01:04:00.470 --> 01:04:09.870
let's just take k nd, the number
of error events of

01:04:09.870 --> 01:04:15.010
minimum weight d, times q to
the square root of alpha

01:04:15.010 --> 01:04:24.805
squared d, where d equals min
weight over sigma squared.

01:04:27.850 --> 01:04:28.280
OK.

01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:32.800
In this case, nd equals
1, d equals 6.

01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:35.270
Let me take this one
step further.

01:04:35.270 --> 01:04:37.350
nd times q to the square
root of --

01:04:40.150 --> 01:04:46.398
what is sigma squared
equals n0 over 2?

01:04:46.398 --> 01:04:53.250
And Eb equals n times
alpha squared.

01:04:53.250 --> 01:04:56.120
The energy per transmitted
bit is alpha squared.

01:04:56.120 --> 01:05:00.760
We're going to transmit n bits
for every information bit.

01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:11.460
So plugging those in, I get 2d
over n times Eb over N0, which

01:05:11.460 --> 01:05:16.830
is again of the form nd q to the
square root of 2 times the

01:05:16.830 --> 01:05:22.310
coding gain of the code
times Eb over N0.

01:05:22.310 --> 01:05:27.190
Bottom line is I get precisely
the same performance analysis,

01:05:27.190 --> 01:05:36.020
or I get a nominal
coding gain of --

01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:40.980
in general, it's kd over n.

01:05:40.980 --> 01:05:44.940
If it were a rate k over n
code, since we're only

01:05:44.940 --> 01:05:49.140
considering rate 1 over n codes,
it's just d over n.

01:05:49.140 --> 01:05:59.720
And I get an error coefficient
which equals the number of

01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:05.690
weight d code words,
starting time 0.

01:06:09.950 --> 01:06:13.000
Of course an error event could
start at any time.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:16.950
If there are nd starting
at time 0, how many

01:06:16.950 --> 01:06:20.230
start at time 1?

01:06:20.230 --> 01:06:23.190
Time invariant code.

01:06:23.190 --> 01:06:26.620
So it's going to be the same
numbers could possibly

01:06:26.620 --> 01:06:27.720
start at time 1.

01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:30.330
So what I'm computing here is
the probability of an error

01:06:30.330 --> 01:06:34.500
event starting at a
particular time.

01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:39.380
For this particular code,
what do I have?

01:06:39.380 --> 01:06:46.000
I have one event of weight 5.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:55.360
So the nominal coding gain
is 5 over n, which is 2.

01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:56.450
Which is --

01:06:56.450 --> 01:07:03.920
5 is 7 dB, 2 is 3 dB,
so this is 4 dB.

01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:06.300
That's pretty good.

01:07:06.300 --> 01:07:10.370
Nominal coding gain of 4 dB with
only a four state code.

01:07:10.370 --> 01:07:12.690
Obviously a very simple
decoder for this code.

01:07:15.770 --> 01:07:20.040
And what is kd equals 1?

01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:21.400
That implies --

01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:26.380
again, we have the same argument
about whatever the

01:07:26.380 --> 01:07:28.300
error coefficient is.

01:07:28.300 --> 01:07:30.590
You could plot this curve.

01:07:30.590 --> 01:07:33.390
The larger the error coefficient
is, the more the

01:07:33.390 --> 01:07:35.950
curve moves up, and
therefore over.

01:07:35.950 --> 01:07:39.350
You get an effective coding
gain which is less.

01:07:39.350 --> 01:07:42.900
But this means since it's 1,
you don't have to do that.

01:07:42.900 --> 01:07:45.720
The effective coding gain
is the same as the

01:07:45.720 --> 01:07:47.580
nominal coding gain.

01:07:47.580 --> 01:07:49.890
It's still 4 dB.

01:07:49.890 --> 01:07:54.010
So it's a real 4 dB of coding
gain for the simple little two

01:07:54.010 --> 01:07:55.260
state code.

01:07:59.220 --> 01:08:07.630
This code compares very directly
with the 8 4 4

01:08:07.630 --> 01:08:11.430
Reed-Muller code, block code.

01:08:11.430 --> 01:08:13.550
This code also has rate 1/2.

01:08:13.550 --> 01:08:14.460
It has the same rate.

01:08:14.460 --> 01:08:18.950
We'll see that it also has a
four-state trellis diagram.

01:08:18.950 --> 01:08:23.090
But it only has distance four,
which means its nominal coding

01:08:23.090 --> 01:08:26.970
gain is only 2, 3 dB.

01:08:26.970 --> 01:08:34.370
And furthermore, it has 14
minimum weight words, which

01:08:34.370 --> 01:08:37.939
even dividing by 4 to get the
number per bit, there's still

01:08:37.939 --> 01:08:41.779
a factor of 3, still going to
cost us another couple of

01:08:41.779 --> 01:08:42.710
tenths of a dB.

01:08:42.710 --> 01:08:48.457
Its effective coding gain is
only about 2.6 or 2.7 dB.

01:08:48.457 --> 01:08:48.890
All right?

01:08:48.890 --> 01:08:54.100
So this code has much better
performance for about the same

01:08:54.100 --> 01:08:59.920
complexity as this code,
at the same rate.

01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:01.520
And this tends to be typical.

01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:05.939
Convolutional codes just beat
block codes when you compare

01:09:05.939 --> 01:09:07.640
them in this way.

01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:11.620
Notice that we're assuming
maximum likelihood decoding.

01:09:11.620 --> 01:09:15.279
We don't yet have a maximum
likelihood decoding algorithm

01:09:15.279 --> 01:09:15.960
for this code.

01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:19.510
We'll find for this code, we can
also decode it using the

01:09:19.510 --> 01:09:22.529
Viterbi algorithm with
a four state decoder

01:09:22.529 --> 01:09:24.100
comparable to this one.

01:09:24.100 --> 01:09:26.640
So it would be, I would say,
for maximum likelihood

01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:28.740
decoding --

01:09:28.740 --> 01:09:30.040
about same complexity.

01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:33.080
But we simply get much better
performance with the

01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:33.680
convolutional.

01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:34.145
Yeah?

01:09:34.145 --> 01:09:35.395
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:09:37.870 --> 01:09:38.500
PROFESSOR: Say again?

01:09:38.500 --> 01:09:40.500
AUDIENCE: What happened
to the k?

01:09:40.500 --> 01:09:42.830
PROFESSOR: Why is
k equal to 1?

01:09:42.830 --> 01:09:43.660
Which k?

01:09:43.660 --> 01:09:44.189
Over here?

01:09:44.189 --> 01:09:47.130
AUDIENCE: Yeah. kd
[INAUDIBLE].

01:09:47.130 --> 01:09:47.380
PROFESSOR: All right.

01:09:47.380 --> 01:09:50.955
We're only considering
rate 1/n codes.

01:09:50.955 --> 01:09:55.850
If it were a rate k/n code, we
would get k over n, because

01:09:55.850 --> 01:10:00.000
this would be n over k
times alpha squared.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.440
Just the same as before.

01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:05.800
In fact, I just want to wave my
hand, say, everything goes

01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:07.270
through as before.

01:10:07.270 --> 01:10:10.830
As soon as you get the error
event concept, you can reduce

01:10:10.830 --> 01:10:13.870
it to the calculation of
pairwise error probabilities,

01:10:13.870 --> 01:10:16.160
and then the union bound
estimate is as before.

01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:17.410
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

01:10:22.180 --> 01:10:27.600
PROFESSOR: Well, I had my
little trellis here.

01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:33.270
And how long in real time
does it take for

01:10:33.270 --> 01:10:34.565
two paths to merge?

01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:41.560
An error event has got to take
at least nu plus 1 time units

01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:45.650
for two paths to diverge
and then merge

01:10:45.650 --> 01:10:46.900
again in the trellis.

01:10:49.780 --> 01:10:51.030
Is that clear?

01:10:57.850 --> 01:11:03.660
Or put another way, the lowest
degree of any possible error

01:11:03.660 --> 01:11:08.120
event is nu, which means it
actually takes place over nu

01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:09.575
plus 1 time units.

01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:14.300
OK?

01:11:14.300 --> 01:11:14.620
From this.

01:11:14.620 --> 01:11:17.560
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:18.810
PROFESSOR: Why is
the lowest --?

01:11:21.390 --> 01:11:23.760
I'm taking g of d --

01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:26.010
the definition of nu is what?

01:11:26.010 --> 01:11:29.230
The maximum degree of g of d.

01:11:29.230 --> 01:11:30.550
OK?

01:11:30.550 --> 01:11:35.430
So if that's so, then the
shortest length error event is

01:11:35.430 --> 01:11:41.460
1 times g of d, which takes nu
plus 1 time units to run out.

01:11:41.460 --> 01:11:45.000
So error events have to be at
least this long, and then they

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.310
can be any integer length
longer than that.

01:11:53.350 --> 01:11:54.950
You don't look totally happy.

01:11:54.950 --> 01:11:56.780
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:11:56.780 --> 01:11:57.615
PROFESSOR: You understand?

01:11:57.615 --> 01:11:57.890
OK.

01:11:57.890 --> 01:11:59.140
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:12:06.820 --> 01:12:10.050
PROFESSOR: How I see it
from this diagram?

01:12:10.050 --> 01:12:11.880
Where have I got a picture
of a trellis?

01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:14.640
Here I've got a picture
of a trellis.

01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:19.520
I've defined an error
event by taking a

01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:20.690
transmitted code word.

01:12:20.690 --> 01:12:22.880
It's a code sequence.

01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:25.320
This is supposed to represent
some path through the trellis.

01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:27.060
There's one-to-one
correspondence between code

01:12:27.060 --> 01:12:29.500
sequences and trellis paths.

01:12:29.500 --> 01:12:32.890
Then I find another code
sequence, which is the one I

01:12:32.890 --> 01:12:34.080
actually decided on.

01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:37.210
Call that the decoded
code sequence.

01:12:37.210 --> 01:12:40.310
And I say, what's the minimum
length of time they could be

01:12:40.310 --> 01:12:43.040
diverged from one another?

01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:43.200
All right?

01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:46.230
Let's take this particular
trellis.

01:12:46.230 --> 01:12:49.080
What's the minimum length
of time any two paths --

01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:51.995
say, here's the transmitted
path.

01:12:54.540 --> 01:12:58.690
Suppose I try to find another
path that diverges from it?

01:12:58.690 --> 01:12:59.935
Here's one.

01:12:59.935 --> 01:13:01.600
Comes back to it.

01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:02.950
Here's one.

01:13:02.950 --> 01:13:03.470
Another one.

01:13:03.470 --> 01:13:06.730
Comes back to it.

01:13:06.730 --> 01:13:08.550
I say that the minimum length
of time it could

01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:10.030
take is nu plus 1.

01:13:10.030 --> 01:13:10.910
Why?

01:13:10.910 --> 01:13:14.940
Because the difference between
these two paths is itself a

01:13:14.940 --> 01:13:19.800
code sequence, is therefore
a non-zero polynomial

01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:23.310
multiple of g of d.

01:13:23.310 --> 01:13:23.970
OK?

01:13:23.970 --> 01:13:25.220
Same argument.

01:13:30.210 --> 01:13:32.830
OK.

01:13:32.830 --> 01:13:36.270
So I guess I'm not going to get
into chapter 10, so I'll

01:13:36.270 --> 01:13:41.240
discourse a little bit more
about convolutional codes

01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:42.490
versus block codes.

01:13:54.940 --> 01:13:59.480
How do you construct
convolutional codes, actually?

01:13:59.480 --> 01:14:03.820
You see that really, what you
want to do is to first of all,

01:14:03.820 --> 01:14:07.250
maximize the minimum distance
for certain constraint length.

01:14:07.250 --> 01:14:10.220
Subject to that, you want to
minimize the number of minimum

01:14:10.220 --> 01:14:13.220
distance words.

01:14:13.220 --> 01:14:18.050
You want to, in fact, get the
best distance profile.

01:14:18.050 --> 01:14:20.620
Is there any block codes?

01:14:20.620 --> 01:14:23.340
We had nice, algebraic
ways of doing this.

01:14:23.340 --> 01:14:25.830
Roots of polynomials,
Reed-Solomon codes.

01:14:25.830 --> 01:14:31.090
We could develop an algebraic
formula which told us what the

01:14:31.090 --> 01:14:32.380
minimum distance was.

01:14:32.380 --> 01:14:34.600
Do we have any nice algebraic
constructions like that

01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:35.830
convolutional code?

01:14:35.830 --> 01:14:38.300
No.

01:14:38.300 --> 01:14:41.940
Basically, you've just got to
search all the possible

01:14:41.940 --> 01:14:45.360
polynomials where the maximum
degree is nu.

01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:46.405
Take pairs of polynomials.

01:14:46.405 --> 01:14:50.690
If you want a rate 1/2 code of
degree nu, there's not that

01:14:50.690 --> 01:14:52.470
many things you have
to search.

01:14:52.470 --> 01:14:53.190
All right?

01:14:53.190 --> 01:14:56.660
You just take all possible pairs
of binary polynomials of

01:14:56.660 --> 01:15:01.760
degree nu or less, making sure
that you don't take any two

01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:06.170
which have a common divisor, an
untrivial common divisor,

01:15:06.170 --> 01:15:08.790
so you can wipe those out.

01:15:08.790 --> 01:15:11.130
You want to make sure that
the constant term is 1.

01:15:11.130 --> 01:15:14.260
There's no point in sliding one
over so it has a larger

01:15:14.260 --> 01:15:16.110
constant term than 1.

01:15:16.110 --> 01:15:20.750
But subject to those provisos,
you simply try all pairs g1,

01:15:20.750 --> 01:15:24.050
g2, and you just do --

01:15:24.050 --> 01:15:27.690
as soon as you've assured
yourself they're not

01:15:27.690 --> 01:15:30.740
catastrophic, they don't have a
common divisor, then you can

01:15:30.740 --> 01:15:33.600
just list, you know, the finite
code words are going to

01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:35.020
be the ones that are
generated by

01:15:35.020 --> 01:15:37.360
finite information sequences.

01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:40.180
So you can just list all the
code words, as I've started to

01:15:40.180 --> 01:15:41.500
do up here.

01:15:41.500 --> 01:15:47.550
Or since the trellis is, in
fact, a way of listing all the

01:15:47.550 --> 01:15:50.190
code words, there's a one-to-one
correspondence

01:15:50.190 --> 01:15:53.330
between code words and trellis
paths, you can just start

01:15:53.330 --> 01:15:57.430
searching through the trellis
and you will quickly find all

01:15:57.430 --> 01:16:01.020
the minimum weight code words,
and thereby establish the

01:16:01.020 --> 01:16:02.880
minimum distance, the
weight profile as

01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:04.550
far out as you like.

01:16:04.550 --> 01:16:05.680
And you choose the best.

01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:07.030
You try all possibilities.

01:16:07.030 --> 01:16:11.980
So Joseph Odenwalder did this
as soon as people recognized

01:16:11.980 --> 01:16:15.130
that short convolutional codes
could be practical, and he

01:16:15.130 --> 01:16:20.140
published the tables back in his
PhD thesis in '69, so he

01:16:20.140 --> 01:16:22.546
got a PhD thesis out of this.

01:16:22.546 --> 01:16:25.510
It wasn't that hard, it's done
once and for all, and the

01:16:25.510 --> 01:16:29.150
results are in the notes.

01:16:29.150 --> 01:16:30.470
The tables.

01:16:30.470 --> 01:16:36.750
And you can see from the
tables that in terms of

01:16:36.750 --> 01:16:39.480
performance versus moderate
complexity,

01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:41.360
things go pretty well.

01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:43.660
Here's this four state code.

01:16:43.660 --> 01:16:47.830
It already gets you 4 dB of
effective coding gain.

01:16:47.830 --> 01:16:51.610
To get to 6 dB of effective
coding gain, you need to go up

01:16:51.610 --> 01:16:54.810
to about 64 states.

01:16:54.810 --> 01:16:57.850
First person to do this was
Jerry Heller at Jet Propulsion

01:16:57.850 --> 01:16:58.530
Laboratory.

01:16:58.530 --> 01:17:03.550
Again, about '68, immediately
after Viterbi proposed his

01:17:03.550 --> 01:17:08.640
algorithm in '67, Heller was the
first to go out and say,

01:17:08.640 --> 01:17:10.560
well, let's see how
these perform.

01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:15.550
So he found a good 64 state
rate 1/2 code, and he did

01:17:15.550 --> 01:17:19.030
probability of error versus Eb
over N0, and he said, wow.

01:17:19.030 --> 01:17:21.340
I get a 6 dB coding gain.

01:17:21.340 --> 01:17:26.040
And Viterbi had no idea that his
algorithm would actually

01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:27.650
be useful in practice.

01:17:27.650 --> 01:17:29.970
He was just using it
to make a proof.

01:17:29.970 --> 01:17:33.330
And he didn't even know
it was optimum.

01:17:33.330 --> 01:17:36.360
But he's always given the credit
to Heller for realizing

01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:37.960
it could be practical.

01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:43.450
And so that 64 state rate 1/2
code with Viterbi algorithm

01:17:43.450 --> 01:17:47.360
decoding became very popular
in the '70s.

01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:50.780
Heller and Viterbi and Jacobs
went off to form a company

01:17:50.780 --> 01:17:52.150
called Linkabit.

01:17:52.150 --> 01:17:58.180
And for the technology of the
time, that seemed to be a very

01:17:58.180 --> 01:18:00.060
appropriate solution.

01:18:00.060 --> 01:18:02.340
You see you get approximately
the same thing as a

01:18:02.340 --> 01:18:04.220
rate 1/3, rate 1/4.

01:18:04.220 --> 01:18:06.995
If you go lower in rate you
can do marginally better.

01:18:06.995 --> 01:18:09.675
If you are after tenths of
a dB, it's worthwhile.

01:18:12.280 --> 01:18:17.280
Later in the decade, is the best
way to get more gain to

01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:20.320
go to more and more complicated

01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:21.420
convolutional codes?

01:18:21.420 --> 01:18:22.840
No.

01:18:22.840 --> 01:18:27.890
The best way is to use the
concatenated idea.

01:18:27.890 --> 01:18:32.950
Once you use these maximum
likelihood decoders, the

01:18:32.950 --> 01:18:37.020
Viterbi decoders, to get your
error rate down to 10 to the

01:18:37.020 --> 01:18:40.330
minus 3 or something, 1 in 1000,
at that point you have

01:18:40.330 --> 01:18:44.750
very few errors, and you can
apply then an outer code to

01:18:44.750 --> 01:18:47.550
clean up the error events
that do occur.

01:18:47.550 --> 01:18:51.190
You see, you're going to get
bursts of errors in your

01:18:51.190 --> 01:18:52.260
decoded sequence.

01:18:52.260 --> 01:18:57.450
It's a very natural idea to have
an outer code, which is

01:18:57.450 --> 01:19:02.740
based on gf of 256,
say, 8 bit bytes.

01:19:02.740 --> 01:19:07.975
And so a Reed-Solomon code comes
along and cleans up the

01:19:07.975 --> 01:19:10.360
errors that do occur, and drives
the error probability

01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:13.580
down to 10 to the minus 12, to
whatever you like it, with

01:19:13.580 --> 01:19:18.040
very little redundancy, very
little additional cost.

01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:21.930
So that became the standard
approach for space

01:19:21.930 --> 01:19:27.430
communications in the '70s
and indeed '80s.

01:19:27.430 --> 01:19:31.980
I've already mentioned that
around '90, they went up to

01:19:31.980 --> 01:19:35.820
this 2 to the fourteenth
state Viterbi decoder.

01:19:35.820 --> 01:19:38.350
They went to much more powerful

01:19:38.350 --> 01:19:40.520
outer codes, much cleverer.

01:19:40.520 --> 01:19:43.670
And they were able to get to
within about 2 or 3 dB of the

01:19:43.670 --> 01:19:45.020
Shannon limit.

01:19:45.020 --> 01:19:47.340
And that was the
state-of-the-art on the eve of

01:19:47.340 --> 01:19:50.520
the discovery of turbo codes,
which is where we're going in

01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:52.220
all of this.

01:19:52.220 --> 01:19:55.070
So from a practical point
of view, in the moderate

01:19:55.070 --> 01:19:58.660
complexity regime, simple
convolutional codes with

01:19:58.660 --> 01:20:03.230
moderate complexity Viterbi
decoding are the best still

01:20:03.230 --> 01:20:04.790
that anybody knows how to do.

01:20:04.790 --> 01:20:06.690
They have all these
system advantages.

01:20:06.690 --> 01:20:09.820
They work with nice synchronous
streams of

01:20:09.820 --> 01:20:12.380
traffic, which is what you want
for data transmission.

01:20:12.380 --> 01:20:14.300
They use soft decisions.

01:20:14.300 --> 01:20:15.750
They use any kind
of reliability

01:20:15.750 --> 01:20:16.710
information you have.

01:20:16.710 --> 01:20:19.230
They're not limited
by hard decisions.

01:20:19.230 --> 01:20:22.880
They're not limited by bounded
systems as the algebraic

01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:24.120
schemes are.

01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:28.470
So it just proved to be a better
way to go on channels

01:20:28.470 --> 01:20:31.850
like the additive white Gaussian
noise channel.

01:20:31.850 --> 01:20:32.240
OK.

01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:33.810
So we didn't get into
chapter 10.

01:20:33.810 --> 01:20:35.060
We'll start that next time.
