00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:03.550
PROFESSOR: There is one handout
being passed out, it's

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:07.360
chapters four and five, so
be sure to pick it up.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.380
And just a reminder that there
is a homework due on next

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.500
Wednesday, so we have homeworks
due every week in

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.560
this course as well.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.010
So last class, we covered
Chapters One through Three

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.240
quite quickly rather, because
it was mostly a review of

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.350
6.450, and one of the key ideas
we covered last class

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:29.810
was the connection between
continuous time and discrete

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.060
time systems.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:40.756
So we have continuous
time, discrete time.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.560
A specific example that
we saw was that of an

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:50.930
orthonormal PAM system.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.660
The architecture for a PAM
system is as follows: you have

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:12.000
Xk, a sequence of symbols
coming in, they

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.640
get into a PAM modulator.

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.870
What you get out is a wave form,
X of t, is what the PAM

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.960
modulator produces.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.400
You have a little noise on the
channel, and what you receive

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.530
out is Y of t.

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.430
So Y of t is the wave form that
the receiver receives,

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.310
and what a canonical receiver's
structure to a

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.245
matched filter followed
by sampling.

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.710
So what you get out is a
sequence of symbols Y of t.

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.610
So this is a structure for an
orthonormal PAM modulator, and

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.640
the continuous time version of
the channel is that you have y

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.410
of p, which is received at
the receiver, plus X of

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:10.764
t, plus N of t.

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:26.820
The discrete time model is you
have the symbol Y of k as the

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.180
output of the sampler.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.310
It equals X of k plus N of k.

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.800
Now basically, we say that the
two systems are equivalent in

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.415
the following sense: if you want
to make a detection of X

00:02:43.415 --> 00:02:47.890
of k here, at the receiver,
Y of k is a sufficient

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.100
statistic, given that Y of t is
received at the front end

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.670
of the receiver.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.750
So that's the equivalence
between discrete time and

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.000
continuous time.

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.140
And the way we established this
fact was by using the

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.530
theorem of irrelevance.

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.860
The noise here is white Gaussian
noise, so if we

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.180
project it onto orthonormal wave
forms, the corresponding

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.185
noise samples would be IID.

00:03:34.185 --> 00:03:36.690
The noise will be independent of
everything which is out of

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.980
band, and so there is no
correlation among the noise

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.100
samples, and Y of k is a
sufficient statistic

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.490
to detect X of k.

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.060
So that is the basic idea.

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.520
Now, a similar architecture
also holds when your

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.140
continuous time system operates
in fast band rather

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.560
than base band, except the main
difference now is instead

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.390
of a PAM modulation, you have
a QAM modulator, and your

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.960
symbols, X of k and N of k, will
be complex numbers rather

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.160
than the real numbers.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.870
Now the connection between
continuous time and discrete

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.519
time systems can be made more
precise by relating some

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.930
parameters in continuous time
with those in discrete time.

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:24.530
OK?

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:33.590
So we have continuous time
parameters, and discrete time

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:34.840
parameters.

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:50.950
So a continuous time parameter
is a bandwidth, W. A discrete

00:04:50.950 --> 00:05:00.505
time parameter is given by
symbol interval T, and the

00:05:00.505 --> 00:05:03.170
relation is T equals
1 over 2W.

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:04.420
This is for a PAM system.

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.530
OK?

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:12.600
So something is shown in 6.450,
and it's shown by using

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.630
Nyquist's ISI criteria.

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.040
Do not want to have ISI in the
system, the maximum symbol

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.410
rate, or rather the minimum
symbol rate,

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:21.910
would be 1 over 2W.

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.920
You cannot send symbols
faster than this rate.

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:30.630
A second criteria is power,
which is P here,

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.600
in continuous time.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:37.930
In discrete time the equivalent
parameter is energy

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:39.580
per two dimensions.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:49.420
It's denoted by Es, and Es is
related to P by using Es

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:51.130
equals 2 times PT.

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:55.340
Note that this is for two
dimensions, meaning in PAM we

00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:00.040
have one symbol per dimension,
so this is for two symbols.

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:03.690
This is energy for two symbols
for a PAM modulator, and the

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:06.090
relation is Es equals
2 times PT.

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:08.915
T is the time for
the one symbol.

00:06:08.915 --> 00:06:11.950
We also -- we are looking at
energy for two symbols, so we

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:13.200
multiply P by 2T.

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:18.900
OK?

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:25.560
Noise in continuous time is
AWGN, for Additive White

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:30.800
Gaussian Noise process, and the
power spectral density is

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:35.110
flat on positive support
of bandwidth, and

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:37.890
the height is N_0.

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:40.070
OK, so this is how the
spectral density is.

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:45.740
In 6.450, we looked at
double-sided power spectral

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:48.980
density when the height was N_0
over two, but it was going

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:50.660
over both the positive and

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:53.200
negative part of the bandwidth.

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.180
Here, we are only looking at
the positive part of the

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.730
bandwidth, and we are going
to scale noise by N_0.

00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:58.980
This is just a convention.

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:09.780
In discrete time, your noise
sequence is Nk, and is an IID

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:14.090
and you take them as Gaussians
with zero mean, and variance

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:15.930
of N_0 over 2.

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:17.530
So we have noise which
has a variance of

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:20.220
N_0 over 2 per dimension.

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:23.360
And this was, again, shown by
this theorem that when you

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:28.040
project noise onto each of the
orthonormal wave forms, you

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:32.155
get the variance
is N_0 over 2.

00:07:32.155 --> 00:07:33.990
OK?

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:38.990
Instead of a base band system,
if you had a fast band system,

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:42.000
then instead of having
a PAM modulator, we

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.280
would have a QAM modulator.

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:48.330
So if instead of PAM we had a
QAM then the main difference

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:50.350
now would be that these symbols
are going to be

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:53.310
complex numbers instead
of real.

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:57.540
So what's the symbol interval
now going to be?

00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:58.500
AUDIENCE: 1 over W.

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:02.070
PROFESSOR: It's going
to be 1 over W.

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:04.630
Instead of sending a real
symbol, we are sending one

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:08.370
complex symbol, which is
occupying two dimensions, and

00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:12.770
our symbol rate is going to be 1
over W. Well, the energy for

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:18.410
two dimensions, is still given
by Es equals 2PT, or

00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:23.570
equivalently, P over W. OK?

00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:24.820
Or that's --

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:38.080
The noise samples Nk are still
IID, but now they are complex

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:44.240
Gaussians, with zero mean,
and variance N_0.

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:45.790
Or equivalently, they
have a variance of

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:48.590
N_0 over 2 per dimension.

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:52.060
So what we see here is that we
can have analogous definitions

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:55.590
for discrete time and continuous
time, and one of

00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:59.750
the key parameters that comes up
over and over again in the

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:04.220
analysis is this notion of
signal to noise ratio.

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:09.550
The signal to noise ratio is
defined as the energy per two

00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:13.335
dimensions, over the noise
variance per two dimensions.

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:19.570
So that's the definition of
signal to noise ratio.

00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:28.630
Es, well, it's 2PT, or
equivalently, P over W. The

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:33.040
noise variance for two
dimensions is N_0, so the

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:35.190
definition is the same as --

00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:40.510
SNR equals P over N_0 W. OK,
are there any questions?

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:49.150
The other notion we talked about
last time is this idea

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:50.400
of the spectral efficiency.

00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:02.310
In continuous time, the
definition is quite natural.

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:05.380
It's denoted by symbol rho.

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:13.060
The units are bits per second
per Hertz, and it's basically

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:20.916
R over W. You have R bits
per second over W hertz.

00:10:20.916 --> 00:10:22.600
So it's the amount of
information bits that I'm able

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:25.050
to send over the amount
of bandwidth that

00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:26.300
I have in my system.

00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:40.300
In discrete time, we can also
define the same idea of

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:48.220
spectral efficiency, but it's
usually -- and a good way to

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:51.600
think about spectral efficiency
from a point of

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:54.100
view of a design
of an encoder.

00:10:54.100 --> 00:11:02.680
What the encoder does, is you
have an encoder here, it takes

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:04.620
a sequence of bits in--

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:08.220
so say you have b
bits coming in--

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:09.470
and it produces N symbols.

00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:19.100
So this could be X1, X2,
Xn, and you have a

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:21.160
sequence of B bits --

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:28.100
b1, b2, b subcapital B. This
is how an encoder operates.

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:31.950
It maps a sequence of bits
to a sequence of symbols.

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:34.045
Now where does the encoder fit
into this architecture?

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:40.640
It fits right here at
the front, right?

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:43.220
You have bits coming in, you
encode them, you produce a

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:47.440
sequence of symbols, and you
send them over the channel.

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:51.040
So if I have this encoder,
what's my the spectral

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:52.300
efficiency going to be?

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:06.100
Well, you have to ask what
the encoder does, right?

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:08.610
So from here, we have
a PAM modulator.

00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:17.315
So it's basically this
from here on, we

00:12:17.315 --> 00:12:19.910
are back to the system.

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:21.560
So what's the spectral
efficiency

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:22.810
now for this system?

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:31.035
How many bits do you
have per symbol?

00:12:34.823 --> 00:12:36.820
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:39.730
PROFESSOR: You have B over
N bits per symbol.

00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:43.620
Now how many symbols do you have
per dimension, if this is

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:44.960
an orthonormal PAM system?

00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:52.890
AUDIENCE: One symbol
per dimension.

00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:54.900
PROFESSOR: You have one symbol
per dimension, right?

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:59.060
So you have B bits per N
dimensions, in other words.

00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:00.310
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:07.970
PROFESSOR: So in QAM how many
-- you have usually how many

00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:09.300
symbols per dimension?

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:09.740
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:12.880
PROFESSOR: Half symbols
per dimension, right.

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:15.650
So in that case, the spectral
efficiency --

00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:23.160
the units are bits per two
dimensions, is 2B over N. B

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:26.805
over N bits per dimension,
because the units are bits per

00:13:26.805 --> 00:13:29.890
two dimensions, you get
2B over N bits per two

00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:31.640
dimensions.

00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:32.600
OK?

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:36.480
Now a natural question to ask
is, how is this definition

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:39.060
related to this definition
here?

00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:42.130
This is quite the natural
definition, and here we have

00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:44.300
imposed this encoder
structure.

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:47.490
Are the two definitions
equivalent in any way?

00:13:47.490 --> 00:13:57.620
And in order to understand
this, let us take

00:13:57.620 --> 00:13:58.870
a one-second snapshot.

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:19.250
So now in one second, I can
send N equals 2W symbols.

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:23.010
Because this is an orthonormal
PAM system, I can send 2W

00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:25.542
symbols per second, but
in one second, I can

00:14:25.542 --> 00:14:28.220
send N equals 2W symbols.

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:33.680
Because my rate is R bits per
second, B equals R, in one

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:35.850
second I can send R bits.

00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:39.980
So now my definition of rho,
which I defined to be 2B over

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:47.000
N, is same as 2R over 2W, which
is R over W. So the

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.380
definitions in continuous time
and discrete time are

00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:50.630
equivalent.

00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:54.380
OK?

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:28.950
Now, why is spectral efficiency
very important?

00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:32.200
Well, there is a very famous
theorem by Shannon which gives

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:35.100
us a nice upper bound on the
spectral efficiency.

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:38.600
Perhaps the most important
theorem in communications is

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:44.610
Shannon's Theorem, it says
that if you have an AWGN

00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:48.830
system with a certain SNR, then
you can immediately bound

00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:56.720
the spectral efficiency by log2
of 1 plus SNR bits per

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:59.070
two dimensions.

00:15:59.070 --> 00:16:01.410
This is a very powerful
statement.

00:16:01.410 --> 00:16:10.460
Equivalently, the capacity of an
AWGN channel is log2 1 plus

00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:15.090
SNR bits per second.

00:16:15.090 --> 00:16:17.750
So one important observation
here is if I have a

00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:20.850
communication system, and if
what I care about is the

00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:24.370
spectral efficiency of the
capacity, there are only two

00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:26.360
terms that are important.

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:30.750
One is the signal to noise
ratio, which is P over N_0 W,

00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:33.020
which is defined here.

00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:36.230
So the individual units of P and
N_0 doesn't matter, it's

00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:38.710
only the ratio of P over
N_0 that matters.

00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:41.240
And the second parameter is the
bandwidth W that we have

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:42.440
in the system.

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:45.930
So signal to noise ratio and
bandwidth are in some sense

00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:49.000
fundamental to the system.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.050
An operational meaning of this
theorem is that if I look at

00:16:53.050 --> 00:16:56.260
this encoder, then it gives me
an upper bound of how many

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:59.090
bits I can put for
each symbol.

00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:02.250
The number of bits that I can
put on each symbol is upper

00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:06.060
bounded by this term here,
log2 1 plus SNR.

00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:10.500
I cannot put arbitrarily many
bits per each symbol here.

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:12.819
Now in order to make such a
statement, there has to be

00:17:12.819 --> 00:17:15.490
some criteria that we
need to satisfy.

00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:17.119
And what is the criteria
for Shannon's Theorem?

00:17:23.609 --> 00:17:26.220
In order to make such a
statement, I need to say that

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:28.630
some objective function
has to be satisfied.

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:30.800
Because in some sense, I could
just put any number of bits I

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:33.270
could have on upper
symbol, right?

00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:36.130
The encoder could just
put 100 or 200 bits.

00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:38.390
What's going to limit me?

00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:39.580
AUDIENCE: Probability
of error?

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:40.920
PROFESSOR: The probability
of error.

00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:42.280
So this assumes that --

00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:54.460
OK?

00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:58.256
Now, you're not responsible for
the proof of this theorem,

00:17:58.256 --> 00:18:00.435
it is in Chapter Three
of the notes.

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:11.890
Basically, it's just a random
coding argument, which is

00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:15.720
quite standard in information
theory.

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:19.330
So if you already taken
information theory or

00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:22.370
otherwise, you would probably
have seen that argument

00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:25.440
involves bounding atypical
events that happen.

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:28.190
So the probability of error is
an atypical event, and we use

00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:30.230
asymptotic equipartition
property to

00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:32.010
bound the error event.

00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:35.210
There's a standard proof in
Cover and Thomas, for example.

00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:39.310
Now the main difference in
Professor Forney's approach is

00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:42.320
that he uses this Theory
of Large Deviations.

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:46.640
Theory of Large Deviations
basically gives you a bound on

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:49.370
the occurrence of rare events,
and it is well-known in

00:18:49.370 --> 00:18:51.070
statistical mechanics.

00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:53.620
So it's kind of a different
approach to the same problem.

00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:55.830
The basic idea is same as you
would find in a standard

00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:57.720
proof, but it uses --

00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:00.010
it comes from this idea of
large deviations theory.

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:10.650
So for those of you who are
taking information theory or

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:13.570
already have seen it, I urge
you, go at some point, take a

00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:14.950
look at this proof.

00:19:14.950 --> 00:19:16.670
It's quite cool.

00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:18.950
I already saw somebody reading
this last Friday, and it was

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:19.950
quite impressive.

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:21.800
So I urge more of
you to do that.

00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:32.810
So now that we have the spectral
efficiency, a natural

00:19:32.810 --> 00:19:34.200
thing is to plot how
the spectral

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:36.220
efficiency looks like.

00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:41.080
So what I'm going to plot is
as a function of SNR the

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:43.990
spectral efficiency.

00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:46.700
Typically, when you plot SNR
on the x-axis, you almost

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:49.140
always plot it on a dB scale.

00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:51.280
But I'm going to make one
exception this time, and I'm

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:55.900
going to plot this on
a linear scale.

00:19:55.900 --> 00:20:02.400
So this point is zero, or minus
infinity dB here, and

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:03.590
I'm going to plot --

00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:06.580
well I should call this,
actually, rho Shannon, so I

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:08.910
don't confuse the notation.

00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:11.650
So we'll define rho Shannon
as log2 1 plus SNR.

00:20:16.030 --> 00:20:19.840
So this is rho Shannon here,
and we want to plot rho

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:22.630
Shannon as a function of SNR.

00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:26.160
Now if my SNR is really small,
log 1 plus SNR is

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:31.000
approximately linear, so I get
a linear increase here.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:38.440
If my SNR is large, then the
logarithmic behavior kicks

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:41.550
into this expression here, so
now the spectral efficiency

00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:44.900
grows slower and slower
with SNR.

00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:49.630
So this is a basic shape for
my spectral efficiency.

00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:52.060
And this immediately suggests
that there are two different

00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:54.110
operating regimes we have.

00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:57.030
One regime where the spectral
efficiency increases linearly

00:20:57.030 --> 00:21:00.320
with SNR, another regime where
the spectral efficiency

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:03.220
increases logarithmically
with SNR.

00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:11.250
So if SNR is very small, then
we call this regime as

00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:12.500
power-limited regime.

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:26.920
And if SNR is large,
we call this the

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:29.320
bandwidth-limited regime.

00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:36.790
These are our definitions.

00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:39.230
And let's see what motivates
their names.

00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:43.200
Suppose I have a 3 dB increase
in my SNR, and I am in power

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:44.760
limited regime.

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:46.025
How does rho Shannon increase?

00:21:51.588 --> 00:21:52.838
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:21:56.370 --> 00:21:58.440
PROFESSOR: A factor
of 2, right?

00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:02.220
Basically, if I have a 3 dB
increase in SNR, my SNR

00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:04.330
increases by a factor of 2.

00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:08.230
In this regime, rho Shannon
increases linearly with SNR,

00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:10.590
so I have a factor of 2 increase
in my spectral

00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:11.680
efficiency.

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:13.840
What about this regime here?

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:17.760
If SNR increases by 3 dB, how
does rho Shannon increase?

00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:34.690
It increases by one bit
per two dimensions.

00:22:34.690 --> 00:22:37.200
Units of rho are bits
per two dimensions.

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:40.130
I have a logarithmic behavior
kicking in, so rho is

00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:42.060
approximately log SNR.

00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:45.120
If I increase SNR by a factor
of 2, I get an additional 1

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:48.030
bit per two dimension scale.

00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:49.590
OK?

00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:53.140
If I increase my bandwidth in
the power-limited regime by a

00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:54.650
factor of 2.

00:22:54.650 --> 00:22:57.870
So this bandwidth here increases
by a factor of 2,

00:22:57.870 --> 00:23:02.750
how does my capacity change,
if I'm in the

00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:04.000
power-limited regime?

00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:12.980
There's no change, right?

00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:16.270
Or is there a change?

00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:19.570
I'm in the power-limited regime
here, and I increase my

00:23:19.570 --> 00:23:21.185
bandwidth by a factor of 2.

00:23:21.185 --> 00:23:22.435
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:27.500
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:29.590
What is my SNR?

00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:32.960
It's P over W N_0.

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:36.400
So what happens if
I fix P over N_0?

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:38.190
OK, yeah, so you had it.

00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:41.370
Basically, if I double my
bandwidth, my SNR decreases by

00:23:41.370 --> 00:23:47.350
a factor of 2, so this term
here is like SNR over 2, W

00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:49.440
increases by a factor
of 2, and there is

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:51.980
no change in bandwidth.

00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:53.230
So let's do it more slowly.

00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:01.840
So we have, say, in the --

00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:19.390
and say, my C is now
W log2 1 plus SNR.

00:24:19.390 --> 00:24:24.970
Instead of SNR, I will write
P over N_0 W. So this

00:24:24.970 --> 00:24:31.970
approximately is W times
P over N_0 W times log

00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:35.090
E to the base 2.

00:24:35.090 --> 00:24:37.330
And this is approximately --

00:24:37.330 --> 00:24:44.300
this is basically P over N_0
times log E to the base 2.

00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:47.330
So in other words, in the
power-limited regime, changing

00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:50.970
bandwidth has no effect
on the capacity.

00:24:50.970 --> 00:24:53.060
What happens in the
bandwidth-limited regime?

00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:14.130
Well, in this case
C equals W log2.

00:25:14.130 --> 00:25:16.680
Well, I can say approximately,
and I can ignore this factor

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:20.750
of 1, because P over N_0 W is
large, because my SNR is large

00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:22.730
in the bandwidth-limited
regime.

00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:27.580
I'm operating in this
part of the graph.

00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:33.720
So this is P over N_0 W. Now
suppose I increase my

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:35.890
bandwidth by a factor of 2.

00:25:35.890 --> 00:25:44.110
C prime will be 2W log2
over P over 2 W N_0.

00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:49.340
All right?

00:25:49.340 --> 00:26:00.220
This, I can write it as 2W log2
P over N_0 W minus --

00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:04.050
this is to the base 2, so
I can write a 1 here.

00:26:04.050 --> 00:26:06.900
And this term is approximately
same --

00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:10.750
if I ignore the 1, if I assume
P over N_0 W is quite large,

00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:13.330
then I can just ignore
the subtraction of 1.

00:26:13.330 --> 00:26:19.610
So I get 2W log2 P over N_0 W,
or it's equivalently 2C.

00:26:19.610 --> 00:26:23.040
OK, so in other words, in the
bandwidth-limited regime, if I

00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:28.480
increase my W by a factor of 2,
the capacity approximately

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:30.330
increases by a factor of 2.

00:26:30.330 --> 00:26:31.960
So that's what motivates
the name

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:35.040
bandwidth-limited regime here.

00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:36.290
Are there any questions?

00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:41.430
OK.

00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:50.010
All right.

00:27:50.010 --> 00:27:54.390
So it turns out that there are
two points I wanted to say.

00:27:54.390 --> 00:27:57.920
First of all, one might ask,
that fine, these seem to be

00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:01.580
interesting definitions, that
SNR is much smaller than one,

00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:04.860
and SNR is much larger than one,
but is there any kind of

00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:07.830
hard division between the
bandwidth-limited regime and

00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:09.450
power-limited regime?

00:28:09.450 --> 00:28:10.900
I mean, the general
answer is no.

00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:11.930
It's basically --

00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:15.680
because there is some point when
the capacity appears not

00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:18.000
strictly logarithmically,
or strictly

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.910
linearly in terms of SNR.

00:28:19.910 --> 00:28:23.980
But from an engineering point
of view, we take rho equals

00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:34.510
two bits per two dimension as
a dividing point between the

00:28:34.510 --> 00:28:35.760
two regimes.

00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:48.100
And one motivation to see why
rho equals two bits per two

00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:51.180
dimension is a good choice is
because this is the maximum

00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:55.680
spectral efficiency we can get
from binary modulation.

00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:58.340
OK, if you want to have spectral
efficiency more than

00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:01.160
two bits per two dimensions, you
have to go to multi-level

00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:05.830
modulation, and that's one of
the reasons why this choice is

00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:09.090
often used in practice.

00:29:09.090 --> 00:29:12.180
Another point is that the
bandwidth-limited regime and

00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:15.340
power-limited regime, they
behave quite differently in

00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:18.390
almost all criterias that
you can think about.

00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:20.040
So usually, with
the analysis --

00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:22.490
we keep them separately and do
the analysis differently in

00:29:22.490 --> 00:29:24.780
the bandwidth and power-limited
regime, and

00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:27.130
that's what we will be doing in
the subsequent part of this

00:29:27.130 --> 00:29:28.450
lecture and next lecture.

00:29:34.110 --> 00:29:36.020
So we start with the
power-limited regime.

00:29:46.520 --> 00:30:03.230
Now, we already saw that in
doubling the power doubles rho

00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:19.600
S, and doubling bandwidth
does not change C.

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:27.890
OK, the other point I
mentioned was binary

00:30:27.890 --> 00:30:37.510
modulation is sufficient in
this regime, because our

00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:39.460
spectral efficiency is less
than two bits per two

00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:42.950
dimensions, so the idea is to
have a strong code followed by

00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:44.200
binary modulation.

00:30:46.490 --> 00:30:47.740
What else?

00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:52.030
Right.

00:30:52.030 --> 00:31:01.100
Typically, the normalization
is done in

00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:02.350
per information bit.

00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:11.300
What does this mean?

00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:14.100
When we are wanting to compare
different systems, we will

00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:16.220
look at all the parameters
normalized

00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:18.150
per information bit.

00:31:18.150 --> 00:31:20.570
For example, if we want to look
at the probability of

00:31:20.570 --> 00:31:25.450
error, we look at this quantity
here, Pb of E, which

00:31:25.450 --> 00:31:29.060
is the probability of error
per information bit, as a

00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:30.310
function of Eb/N_0.

00:31:34.050 --> 00:31:37.270
This is an important trade-off
that we wish to study in

00:31:37.270 --> 00:31:39.020
power-limited regime.

00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:43.310
Eb is the energy per bit, P sub
b of E is the probability

00:31:43.310 --> 00:31:45.372
of error per information bit.

00:32:08.510 --> 00:32:11.360
So I want to spend some time on
this Eb/N_0, because it's

00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:13.370
an important concept
that we'll be using

00:32:13.370 --> 00:32:15.080
often in the course.

00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:16.870
So what is Eb/N_0?

00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:21.190
It's sometimes also known as Eb
over N_0, so it depends how

00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:23.340
you wish to call it.

00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:25.995
What is energy per bit
in terms of Es?

00:32:36.490 --> 00:32:37.010
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:32:37.010 --> 00:32:38.280
PROFESSOR: Well, Es
over rho, right?

00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:39.890
Energy per bit.

00:32:39.890 --> 00:32:42.240
Well, Es is energy per
two dimensions.

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:45.330
Rho is bits per two dimensions,
so Eb is Es over

00:32:45.330 --> 00:32:52.150
rho, and you have N_0 here.

00:32:52.150 --> 00:32:57.403
And Es over N_0 is also our SNR,
so this is SNR over rho.

00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:04.410
OK, so that's how Eb/N_0
is defined.

00:33:04.410 --> 00:33:11.270
Now we know from Shannon that
rho is always less than log2 1

00:33:11.270 --> 00:33:16.810
plus SNR, or equivalently,
2 to the rho minus 1

00:33:16.810 --> 00:33:19.990
is less than SNR.

00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:24.216
If I sub in here, this means
that SNR is greater than 2 to

00:33:24.216 --> 00:33:27.980
the rho minus 1 over
rho, and then we're

00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:29.370
just dividing by rho.

00:33:29.370 --> 00:33:31.590
So Eb/N_0 is always greater
than 2 to the rho

00:33:31.590 --> 00:33:33.760
minus 1 over rho.

00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:36.420
And this is quite an interesting
observation.

00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:39.460
For example, if you are
analyzing the feasibility of a

00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:42.710
communication system, which
has a certain spectral

00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:46.240
efficiency, and a certain
Eb/N_0, then you can

00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:48.990
immediately check this relation,
to see if it is a

00:33:48.990 --> 00:33:51.840
system in the first place.

00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:54.240
What Shannon says is that Eb/N_0
is always going to be

00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:57.060
greater than 2 to the rho
minus 1 over rho.

00:33:57.060 --> 00:34:00.030
So if you see that this relation
is not satisfied,

00:34:00.030 --> 00:34:01.610
immediately know something
is wrong.

00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:06.920
This actually reminds me of an
interesting anecdote that

00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:08.480
Professor Forney once
mentioned when I

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:10.090
was taking the class.

00:34:10.090 --> 00:34:13.170
Well he has been in this field
since the '60's, and so he has

00:34:13.170 --> 00:34:14.989
seen a lot of this stuff.

00:34:14.989 --> 00:34:16.610
He was saying when
turbo codes --

00:34:16.610 --> 00:34:19.449
which is one of the first
capacity approaching codes in

00:34:19.449 --> 00:34:21.730
recent years when they
were proposed --

00:34:21.730 --> 00:34:24.420
they presented the results
at ICC, the International

00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:27.889
Conference in Communications,
and what they saw was that the

00:34:27.889 --> 00:34:33.370
performance was very close to
the limit that we can predict.

00:34:33.370 --> 00:34:36.770
Eb/N_0 was very close to
the ultimate limit --

00:34:36.770 --> 00:34:39.250
the Eb/N_0 achieved by turbo
codes was very close to the

00:34:39.250 --> 00:34:43.500
ultimate limit that one can
predict, at least 3 dB better

00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:45.679
than the best codes that
were available there.

00:34:45.679 --> 00:34:47.789
So most people just thought that
there was something wrong

00:34:47.789 --> 00:34:50.360
in the simulations, and they
told them that there was a

00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:52.560
factor of 2 missing
somewhere, so they

00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:53.929
should just double check.

00:34:53.929 --> 00:34:55.980
But it turned out when they went
back and people actually

00:34:55.980 --> 00:34:58.470
implemented these codes, they
were actually very close to

00:34:58.470 --> 00:35:00.910
the capacity.

00:35:00.910 --> 00:35:04.730
So sometimes, you have
to be careful.

00:35:04.730 --> 00:35:06.770
If you are not going below this
limit, it could be that

00:35:06.770 --> 00:35:08.100
the system is good.

00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:10.217
And when it is, it's a really
important breakthrough.

00:35:10.217 --> 00:35:14.610
Ok

00:35:14.610 --> 00:35:19.830
So one particular concept that
comes here is the idea of

00:35:19.830 --> 00:35:21.375
ultimate Shannon limit.

00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:32.880
And basically, if we are talking
about power limited

00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:35.640
regime, our SNR is very small.

00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:38.920
So our spectral efficiency is
going to be quite small.

00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:40.970
Now notice that this function
here it monotonically

00:35:40.970 --> 00:35:43.450
increasing in rho.

00:35:43.450 --> 00:35:46.130
It's easy to show that this
function here increases

00:35:46.130 --> 00:35:47.430
monotonically in rho.

00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:50.380
You could just differentiate
this, or there's easier ways

00:35:50.380 --> 00:35:53.630
to do a Taylor expansion of 2 to
the rho minus 1, the series

00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:56.090
expansion and show each
term is positive.

00:35:56.090 --> 00:35:58.080
So if this term is always
going to be greater

00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:01.360
than this term here.

00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:04.420
So I'm going from
here to here.

00:36:04.420 --> 00:36:10.530
Limit rho tends to zero of 2 to
the rho minus 1 over rho.

00:36:10.530 --> 00:36:13.740
This is going to be -- it's a
simple calculus exercise to

00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:16.770
show this is the natural
log of 2, or in dB,

00:36:16.770 --> 00:36:21.780
it's minus 1.59 dB.

00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:25.720
So no matter what system you
design, your Eb/N_0 is always

00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:29.230
going to be greater than
minus 1.59 dB.

00:36:29.230 --> 00:36:32.050
That's basically what this
calculation shows.

00:36:32.050 --> 00:36:33.270
And when is it achieved?

00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:34.770
Well, it's only achieved
when the spectral

00:36:34.770 --> 00:36:37.250
efficiency goes to zero.

00:36:37.250 --> 00:36:40.210
So if you have a deep space
communication system, where

00:36:40.210 --> 00:36:42.500
you have lots and lots of
bandwidth, and you do not care

00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:46.490
about spectral efficiency, then
if your only criteria is

00:36:46.490 --> 00:36:49.270
to minimize Eb/N_0, then you
can design your system

00:36:49.270 --> 00:36:52.260
accordingly, check how much
Eb/N_0 you require for a

00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:55.110
certain probability of error,
and see how far you are from

00:36:55.110 --> 00:36:57.300
the ultimate Shannon limit.

00:36:57.300 --> 00:36:59.970
So in this way, in the
power-limited regime, you can

00:36:59.970 --> 00:37:03.650
quantify your gap to capacity,
if you will, through this

00:37:03.650 --> 00:37:07.090
ultimate Shannon limit.

00:37:07.090 --> 00:37:08.370
OK, are there any questions?

00:38:44.890 --> 00:38:45.710
OK.

00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:47.735
So now let's look at the
bandwidth-limited regime.

00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:04.650
So we already saw two
things in the

00:39:04.650 --> 00:39:06.410
bandwidth-limited regime.

00:39:06.410 --> 00:39:15.830
If I double P, my spectral
efficiency increases by one

00:39:15.830 --> 00:39:17.080
bit per two dimension.

00:39:19.900 --> 00:39:30.140
Similarly, if I double bandwidth
by C, capacity

00:39:30.140 --> 00:39:31.390
approximately doubles.

00:39:37.648 --> 00:39:40.260
Now, because you want a spectral
efficiency of more

00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:43.440
than two bits per two dimension,
in this system you

00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:45.815
typically do a multi-level
modulation.

00:39:53.650 --> 00:39:56.830
So for those of you who are
familiar, we do things like

00:39:56.830 --> 00:39:59.760
trellis-coded modulation, and
bit-interleaved coded

00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:01.080
modulation, and so on.

00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:03.280
If we have time, we'll be seeing
those things towards

00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:05.370
the very end of the course.

00:40:05.370 --> 00:40:07.940
This is not a subject of
the course as such.

00:40:11.470 --> 00:40:20.420
The normalization in this
regime is done for two

00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:21.670
dimensions.

00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:28.405
So if you want to normalize
all the quantities, we

00:40:28.405 --> 00:40:30.980
normalize them for two
dimensions here.

00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:35.740
And particularly, we will be
seeing probability of error as

00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:38.850
a function of this quantity
called SNR norm.

00:40:42.315 --> 00:40:45.930
So this is the performance
analysis that is done in

00:40:45.930 --> 00:40:47.930
bandwidth-limited regimes.

00:40:47.930 --> 00:40:59.450
Here Ps of E is the probability
of error for two

00:40:59.450 --> 00:41:00.700
dimensions.

00:41:05.290 --> 00:41:06.540
What is SNR norm?

00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:18.830
It's defined to be SNR over
2 to the rho minus 1.

00:41:18.830 --> 00:41:21.810
Why do we divide by 2
to the rho minus 1?

00:41:21.810 --> 00:41:25.420
Well, that's the minimum SNR
that you require for the best

00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:26.740
possible system.

00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:28.970
That's what Shannon
says, right?

00:41:28.970 --> 00:41:31.320
So this quantity here is always
going to be greater

00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:33.510
than 1, or 0 dB.

00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:38.640
So OK, well, this is the
ultimate Shannon limit in the

00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:40.860
bandwidth-limited regime.

00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:43.720
If you have a system that is
designed, that operates at a

00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:47.540
certain SNR and a certain
spectral efficiency, you can

00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:52.220
calculate SNR norm and see how
far you are from 0 dB.

00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:55.170
If you're very close to 0
dB, then that's great.

00:41:55.170 --> 00:41:57.890
You have a very good
system in practice.

00:41:57.890 --> 00:42:01.310
If not, then you have room
for improvement.

00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:07.600
And so, in other
words, SNR norm

00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:12.950
defines the gap to capacity.

00:42:30.685 --> 00:42:32.155
OK, so let's do an example.

00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:40.760
Suppose we have an
M-PAM system.

00:42:43.750 --> 00:42:46.620
So we have an M-PAM
constellation.

00:42:46.620 --> 00:42:48.000
So how does it look like?

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:52.350
Well, you have points here
on a linear line.

00:42:52.350 --> 00:42:58.830
This point is say minus alpha,
alpha, three alpha minus three

00:42:58.830 --> 00:43:05.700
alpha, all the way up to m minus
one alpha, and here,

00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:08.780
minus of m minus one alpha.

00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:10.050
Assume m is an even number.

00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:16.750
So the distance between two
points here is two alpha, any

00:43:16.750 --> 00:43:18.450
two points.

00:43:18.450 --> 00:43:25.400
Now we want to find the SNR norm
given that we are using

00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:26.650
this constellation.

00:43:34.220 --> 00:43:37.540
So in other words, if I use
this constellation in my

00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:40.800
communication system, how far
am I operating from the

00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:43.420
ultimate Shannon limit?

00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:46.280
OK, that's the question.

00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:51.760
So in order to find what we need
to find, is first energy

00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:53.970
for two dimensions.

00:43:53.970 --> 00:43:55.790
Does anybody remember the
formula for M-PAM?

00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:04.000
Well, there was a very nice
way of doing it in 450.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.890
One natural way is to simply sum
up all of the coordinates

00:44:06.890 --> 00:44:11.480
here, square them, and divide by
M. And because it's for two

00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:14.810
dimensions, we could do it --

00:44:14.810 --> 00:44:16.980
we're to multiply by a factor
of two, because it's for two

00:44:16.980 --> 00:44:18.360
dimensions--

00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:20.060
and summation of Xk squared.

00:44:23.290 --> 00:44:26.400
And if you work out, you will
get some answer here.

00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:29.250
Another way that was
shown in 450 --

00:44:29.250 --> 00:44:31.740
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:44:31.740 --> 00:44:33.940
PROFESSOR: With uniform
quantization, exactly.

00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:38.260
So the idea here is, you have
a source, say, which is

00:44:38.260 --> 00:44:44.460
uniformly distributed between
M alpha and minus M alpha.

00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:47.470
So you have a source uniformly
distributed, and it can be

00:44:47.470 --> 00:44:52.010
easily seen by inspection that
M-PAM is the best quantizer

00:44:52.010 --> 00:44:55.540
for this particular source.

00:44:55.540 --> 00:44:55.615
Ok.

00:44:55.615 --> 00:45:03.510
So the interval regions are
just of equal width.

00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:08.940
Each interval region is width
two alpha, so your mean square

00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:19.250
error, if you will, is 2 alpha
squared over 12, so it's alpha

00:45:19.250 --> 00:45:21.460
squared over 3.

00:45:21.460 --> 00:45:24.800
Well, the variance in your
source, which I will denote by

00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:32.610
sigma square s, is 2M alpha
squared over 12, or it's M

00:45:32.610 --> 00:45:35.790
squared alpha squared over 3.

00:45:35.790 --> 00:45:40.450
So your energy per symbol --

00:45:40.450 --> 00:45:45.090
it's energy in your quantizer,
so I'm denoting it by E of A

00:45:45.090 --> 00:45:47.850
in order to differentiate it by
Es, because Es is two times

00:45:47.850 --> 00:45:50.080
E of A, OK?

00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:54.260
It's going to be m squared
minus 1 times alpha

00:45:54.260 --> 00:45:55.530
squared over 3.

00:45:55.530 --> 00:46:00.840
So Es is 2 E of A, and so we
get it's 2 times alpha

00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:03.600
squared, m squared
minus 1 over 3.

00:46:08.910 --> 00:46:12.110
OK, so can anybody tell me what
the spectral efficiency

00:46:12.110 --> 00:46:16.020
will be for the system, if I
use an M-PAM constellation?

00:46:29.982 --> 00:46:32.180
Well, how many bits per
symbol do I have?

00:46:34.988 --> 00:46:36.860
AUDIENCE: Log2M.

00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:38.190
PROFESSOR: Log2 M
bits per symbol.

00:46:38.190 --> 00:46:41.475
So since it's bits per two
dimensions, the sum would be 2

00:46:41.475 --> 00:46:44.600
logM to the base 2.

00:46:49.660 --> 00:46:49.865
Ok?

00:46:49.865 --> 00:46:52.160
So right now, we have pretty
much everything we need to

00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:54.360
find SNR norm.

00:46:54.360 --> 00:47:05.790
The SNR here is Es over N_0,
so it's 2 alpha squared, M

00:47:05.790 --> 00:47:09.370
squared minus 1, over 3N_0.

00:47:09.370 --> 00:47:13.120
But remember, N_0 by definition
is 2 sigma squared,

00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:15.206
because sigma squared
is N_0 over 2.

00:47:17.772 --> 00:47:21.140
That's how -- that's the noise
variance per dimension.

00:47:21.140 --> 00:47:25.830
So, I had 3 times 2 times sigma
squared, or I will just

00:47:25.830 --> 00:47:30.390
write this as 6 times sigma
squared, and that's going to

00:47:30.390 --> 00:47:32.280
be -- this is just
multiplication, so I should

00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:33.180
not even write it --

00:47:33.180 --> 00:47:34.820
six sigma squared.

00:47:34.820 --> 00:47:39.650
So this is alpha squared,
M squared minus 1

00:47:39.650 --> 00:47:43.370
over 3 sigma squared.

00:47:43.370 --> 00:47:56.060
OK, so now SNR norm is SNR over
2 to the rho minus 1.

00:47:56.060 --> 00:47:59.150
2 to the rho minus 1 is just
M squared minus 1.

00:47:59.150 --> 00:48:04.030
It cancels with this M squared
minus 1, and so I get alpha

00:48:04.030 --> 00:48:08.280
squared over 3 sigma squared.

00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:11.820
So that's the SNR norm if
I use an M-PAM system.

00:48:26.730 --> 00:48:27.980
AUDIENCE: Why is [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:34.150
PROFESSOR: Well, N_0 --

00:48:34.150 --> 00:48:40.830
I've plugged in for SNR 3 here,
so I have 3 N_0, but N_0

00:48:40.830 --> 00:48:42.080
is 2 sigma squared.

00:48:51.015 --> 00:48:52.265
Did I miss anything?

00:49:46.202 --> 00:49:46.401
Ok?

00:49:46.401 --> 00:49:47.651
Any questions?

00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:57.710
OK, so there are two important
remarks from this example.

00:49:57.710 --> 00:50:11.900
The first remark is that SNR
norm is independent of M. So I

00:50:11.900 --> 00:50:15.120
started with an M-PAM
constellation, so it's a

00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:18.570
different constellation for
each value of M, right?

00:50:18.570 --> 00:50:21.780
If I look at my spectral
efficiency rho, it's different

00:50:21.780 --> 00:50:24.240
for each value of M, because I
can pack more and more bits

00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:28.090
per symbol as I increase M. If
I look at my signal to noise

00:50:28.090 --> 00:50:33.910
ratio, it's also a function of
M. But when I took SNR norm,

00:50:33.910 --> 00:50:36.870
remarkably, the M squared minus
1 term cancelled out in

00:50:36.870 --> 00:50:40.030
the numerator and denominator,
and what I was left with was

00:50:40.030 --> 00:50:42.770
something independent of M.

00:50:42.770 --> 00:50:45.300
So this is actually quite
an interesting result.

00:50:45.300 --> 00:50:49.060
What it says is suppose I design
a system, an M-PAM

00:50:49.060 --> 00:50:51.350
system, that has this
particular spectral

00:50:51.350 --> 00:50:55.620
efficiency, then my gap to
capacity is given by this

00:50:55.620 --> 00:50:57.000
expression.

00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:01.770
If I use a different value of
M, my gap to the ultimate

00:51:01.770 --> 00:51:05.340
Shannon limit is still given
by this expression here.

00:51:05.340 --> 00:51:08.630
So by increasing value of M or
decreasing the value of M, my

00:51:08.630 --> 00:51:12.330
gap to the Shannon limit is
still going to be the same.

00:51:12.330 --> 00:51:14.200
For each value of M, I will
have a different spectral

00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:17.920
efficiency, but I'm not getting
any kind of coding

00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:20.380
gain, if you will, here.

00:51:20.380 --> 00:51:28.900
OK, so this motivates that M-PAM
is an uncoded system.

00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:37.500
All of them have the same gap
to the Shannon limit,

00:51:37.500 --> 00:51:40.505
regardless of what the value
of M is, and so.

00:51:46.340 --> 00:51:51.550
The second point to note is if
I look at the value of alpha

00:51:51.550 --> 00:51:54.420
squared over 3 sigma square,
I can make it

00:51:54.420 --> 00:51:56.110
quite small, right?

00:51:56.110 --> 00:51:59.770
I can even, if I decrease
alpha really by a great

00:51:59.770 --> 00:52:03.620
amount, I can make this quantity
smaller than 1.

00:52:03.620 --> 00:52:04.600
OK?

00:52:04.600 --> 00:52:09.890
I told you here that SNR norm
is always greater than 1.

00:52:09.890 --> 00:52:11.890
So what happened?

00:52:11.890 --> 00:52:14.580
Did I lie to you here, or did
I do something wrong here?

00:52:18.570 --> 00:52:20.910
I mean, I can choose any alpha,
right, and make this

00:52:20.910 --> 00:52:24.300
quantity as small as I please,
and then I'm doing better than

00:52:24.300 --> 00:52:26.561
the Shannon limit.

00:52:26.561 --> 00:52:27.811
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:52:29.900 --> 00:52:30.270
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:52:30.270 --> 00:52:33.310
So basically, what's missing
in this calculation is

00:52:33.310 --> 00:52:34.940
probability of error.

00:52:34.940 --> 00:52:38.240
If I make alpha really small,
what I have is all these

00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:41.560
points come closer and closer,
and sure, I seem like I'm

00:52:41.560 --> 00:52:42.800
doing very well at
the encoder.

00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:44.880
But what happens
at the decoder?

00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:48.410
There is noise in the system,
and so I get too many errors.

00:52:48.410 --> 00:52:51.070
This lower bound clearly assumes
that you can make your

00:52:51.070 --> 00:52:53.000
probability of error
quite small,

00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:54.800
arbitrarily small, right?

00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:57.410
So in any reasonable system,
I should also look at the

00:52:57.410 --> 00:52:59.020
probability of error.

00:52:59.020 --> 00:53:01.540
If I make alpha really small,
I'm going to have too much

00:53:01.540 --> 00:53:07.270
error at the decoder, and so
I won't be able to have a

00:53:07.270 --> 00:53:08.520
practical system.

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:23.870
So the comment is SNR norm
cannot be seen in isolation.

00:53:28.700 --> 00:53:31.050
We need to couple SNR norm
with the corresponding

00:53:31.050 --> 00:53:32.330
probability of error.

00:53:32.330 --> 00:53:32.703
Yes?

00:53:32.703 --> 00:53:35.240
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:53:35.240 --> 00:53:37.450
PROFESSOR: What I mean
by uncoded syst --

00:53:37.450 --> 00:53:38.930
that's a good question.

00:53:38.930 --> 00:53:41.350
What do I mean by
uncoded system?

00:53:41.350 --> 00:53:45.390
All I'm really saying here is
M-PAM system is a fairly

00:53:45.390 --> 00:53:47.730
simple system to implement,
right?

00:53:47.730 --> 00:53:51.420
Irregardless of what value of M
I get, I have a certain gap

00:53:51.420 --> 00:53:54.940
to the Shannon limit, which is
independent of M. So if I

00:53:54.940 --> 00:53:58.230
start with a simple system,
where I have bits coming in,

00:53:58.230 --> 00:54:00.840
each bit gets mapped to one
symbol, and I send it over the

00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:03.980
channel, I have a fixed gap
to the Shannon capacity.

00:54:03.980 --> 00:54:06.360
And this, I will call
an uncoded system.

00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:09.930
My only hope will be to improve
upon this system.

00:54:09.930 --> 00:54:11.190
OK?

00:54:11.190 --> 00:54:13.168
Any other questions?

00:54:13.168 --> 00:54:15.144
AUDIENCE: So, if I'm multiplying
[INAUDIBLE]

00:54:19.100 --> 00:54:19.790
PROFESSOR: Right, right.

00:54:19.790 --> 00:54:22.263
I'm assuming the fixed alpha.

00:54:22.263 --> 00:54:24.190
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:54:24.190 --> 00:54:27.350
PROFESSOR: I mean, basically,
you will see that alpha is a

00:54:27.350 --> 00:54:28.895
function of Es, right?

00:54:28.895 --> 00:54:30.145
And I want to --

00:54:36.890 --> 00:54:38.870
so why do I want -- the question
is, why do I want to

00:54:38.870 --> 00:54:41.880
keep alpha fixed, right?

00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:42.140
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:54:42.140 --> 00:54:44.300
PROFESSOR: OK, so in order to
understand that, I have to

00:54:44.300 --> 00:54:47.840
look at energy for
two dimensions.

00:54:47.840 --> 00:54:50.040
If I normalize by M squared
minus one --

00:54:52.650 --> 00:54:53.900
that doesn't work out.

00:55:01.340 --> 00:55:02.590
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:55:08.430 --> 00:55:10.875
so the constellation cannot be
expanding [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:55:13.810 --> 00:55:15.600
PROFESSOR: Right, so I wanted
to always plot by keeping

00:55:15.600 --> 00:55:16.370
alpha fixed.

00:55:16.370 --> 00:55:19.610
And I mean, the point is,
typically you want to plot the

00:55:19.610 --> 00:55:22.190
probability of symbol error --

00:55:22.190 --> 00:55:25.460
do I have that expression
anywhere?

00:55:25.460 --> 00:55:26.160
Right there.

00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:29.030
Ps of p is a function
of SNR norm, right?

00:55:29.030 --> 00:55:31.890
And that will be -- if I
increase SNR norm, so it will

00:55:31.890 --> 00:55:33.310
be some kind of a
graph, right?

00:55:33.310 --> 00:55:34.370
A trade-off.

00:55:34.370 --> 00:55:37.380
Basically, alpha will define the
trade-off between SNR norm

00:55:37.380 --> 00:55:39.640
and Ps of p.

00:55:39.640 --> 00:55:43.810
So as I slip over larger and
larger values of alpha, for

00:55:43.810 --> 00:55:48.160
different values of M, then I
will have a trade-off as Ps of

00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:50.840
p is a function of SNR norm.

00:55:50.840 --> 00:55:52.990
Does that make sense?

00:55:52.990 --> 00:55:56.370
So say I fixed a
value of M, OK?

00:55:56.370 --> 00:55:58.740
I define SNR norm, which
is alpha squared

00:55:58.740 --> 00:56:00.390
over 3 sigma squared.

00:56:00.390 --> 00:56:03.450
For this, I will get a certain
probability of error now.

00:56:03.450 --> 00:56:05.920
So if I fix this value of SNR
norm, I get a certain

00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:07.410
probability of error.

00:56:07.410 --> 00:56:09.220
What if I want to increase
my SNR norm?

00:56:09.220 --> 00:56:11.430
The only way to do that will
be to increase alpha.

00:56:15.340 --> 00:56:18.020
Does that make sense?

00:56:18.020 --> 00:56:19.140
Yeah.

00:56:19.140 --> 00:56:20.390
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:56:22.605 --> 00:56:28.980
You're defining SNR norm as the
gap to capacity, but it

00:56:28.980 --> 00:56:32.516
seems like, I mean, obviously as
you increase alpha, as you

00:56:32.516 --> 00:56:34.350
increase your signal energy,
you're going to do better and

00:56:34.350 --> 00:56:35.020
better, right?

00:56:35.020 --> 00:56:35.930
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:56:35.930 --> 00:56:37.420
AUDIENCE: Well, in
terms of what?

00:56:37.420 --> 00:56:39.630
In terms of probability of
error, like achievable

00:56:39.630 --> 00:56:41.300
probability of error, or?

00:56:41.300 --> 00:56:42.220
PROFESSOR: Right, exactly.

00:56:42.220 --> 00:56:48.460
So basically, the point is say
I plot Ps of E as a function

00:56:48.460 --> 00:56:50.610
of SNR norm, or as a function
of alpha squared

00:56:50.610 --> 00:56:52.700
over 3 sigma squared.

00:56:52.700 --> 00:56:54.868
So my core will look
like this.

00:56:54.868 --> 00:56:58.272
AUDIENCE: But the gap to
capacity is defined all the

00:56:58.272 --> 00:56:59.760
way over here on the left,
is that what--?

00:56:59.760 --> 00:57:01.100
PROFESSOR: Right, that's
a very good question.

00:57:01.100 --> 00:57:03.560
You are going much ahead
then what I thought.

00:57:03.560 --> 00:57:09.250
So basically, at zero, seven,
SNR norm is zero, right?

00:57:09.250 --> 00:57:11.270
This is in linear scale,
so when I have

00:57:11.270 --> 00:57:13.500
one, SNR norm is one.

00:57:13.500 --> 00:57:15.940
I have the Shannon system.

00:57:15.940 --> 00:57:19.890
Basically, for any SNR norm
greater than 1, what Shannon

00:57:19.890 --> 00:57:21.990
says is your probability of
error will be arbitrarily

00:57:21.990 --> 00:57:25.290
small, and here, it
will be large.

00:57:25.290 --> 00:57:27.500
So this here is the
Shannon limit.

00:57:27.500 --> 00:57:30.120
And now, in a practical system,
what I want to do is I

00:57:30.120 --> 00:57:32.080
want to fix the probability
of error.

00:57:32.080 --> 00:57:33.840
So say I like probability
of error of ten

00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:35.620
to the minus five.

00:57:35.620 --> 00:57:38.520
So that's something that
the system specifies.

00:57:38.520 --> 00:57:41.970
And from that, I know the
gap to the capacity.

00:57:41.970 --> 00:57:44.800
So if here, if I require, this
is my SNR norm, then this is

00:57:44.800 --> 00:57:45.980
going to be my gap.

00:57:45.980 --> 00:57:47.630
I wanted to cover
it, but later.

00:57:47.630 --> 00:57:50.372
That's a good point.

00:57:50.372 --> 00:57:51.622
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:58:00.725 --> 00:58:04.150
PROFESSOR: Right, this is a
certain, specific system, the

00:58:04.150 --> 00:58:07.110
M-PAM system.

00:58:07.110 --> 00:58:10.440
What Shannon says that, if
you're anywhere here, you

00:58:10.440 --> 00:58:12.030
should be able to make your
probability of error

00:58:12.030 --> 00:58:14.540
arbitrarily small.

00:58:14.540 --> 00:58:17.627
So your code should basically
look something like this, if

00:58:17.627 --> 00:58:19.170
you will, or even steeper.

00:58:21.850 --> 00:58:24.176
AUDIENCE: What's the difference
between that curve

00:58:24.176 --> 00:58:26.030
and the wider curve?

00:58:26.030 --> 00:58:28.030
PROFESSOR: This curve
and this curve?

00:58:28.030 --> 00:58:28.860
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:58:28.860 --> 00:58:29.890
PROFESSOR: This is
basically what we

00:58:29.890 --> 00:58:32.390
achieved by an M-PAM system.

00:58:32.390 --> 00:58:34.240
I don't want to go into too much
of this, because we'll be

00:58:34.240 --> 00:58:35.070
doing this later.

00:58:35.070 --> 00:58:38.190
This is the next topic.

00:58:38.190 --> 00:58:41.370
Ideally, what we would want is
something, basically, this is

00:58:41.370 --> 00:58:43.450
my Shannon limit, I want
something such as the

00:58:43.450 --> 00:58:46.590
probability of error decreases
right away as soon as I am

00:58:46.590 --> 00:58:47.890
just away from the
Shannon limit.

00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:52.590
All right.

00:58:52.590 --> 00:58:54.680
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:58:54.680 --> 00:58:55.010
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:58:55.010 --> 00:58:56.380
So that's a good point.

00:58:56.380 --> 00:58:58.700
So if I did not do coding,
this is what I get.

00:58:58.700 --> 00:59:00.630
If I did coding, this
is what I would get.

00:59:00.630 --> 00:59:04.238
So this is how much I can expect
a gain from coding.

00:59:04.238 --> 00:59:06.310
AUDIENCE: So in other words,
basically, this bound is

00:59:06.310 --> 00:59:10.550
basically in my channel,
the SNR is such that --

00:59:10.550 --> 00:59:14.785
I mean, I'm so energy limited
that my SNR norm is lower than

00:59:14.785 --> 00:59:17.670
a certain amount, there's
nothing I can do, basically,

00:59:17.670 --> 00:59:17.930
is what it's saying.

00:59:17.930 --> 00:59:18.210
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:59:18.210 --> 00:59:20.970
Because if you want a certain
spectral efficiency, there's

00:59:20.970 --> 00:59:24.010
also spectral efficiency,
right?

00:59:24.010 --> 00:59:26.700
And if your SNR is much lower,
you're out of luck.

00:59:26.700 --> 00:59:28.398
AUDIENCE: So basically, you
have to make your spectral

00:59:28.398 --> 00:59:29.790
efficiency higher --

00:59:29.790 --> 00:59:30.720
or, lower.

00:59:30.720 --> 00:59:31.560
PROFESSOR: Lower, right.

00:59:31.560 --> 00:59:32.810
Exactly.

01:00:13.380 --> 01:00:16.280
So now let us start with the
probability of error analysis,

01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:19.200
and we'll start in
limited regime.

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:22.840
So we have Eb of E as a function
of Eb/N_0, we want to

01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:24.370
quantify this trade-off.

01:00:24.370 --> 01:00:27.110
Basically, what we are doing now
is trying to quantify how

01:00:27.110 --> 01:00:29.430
this graph will look like,
at least for the

01:00:29.430 --> 01:00:30.970
uncoded systems today.

01:00:30.970 --> 01:00:34.270
We'll do coding next class,
or two classes from

01:00:34.270 --> 01:00:36.780
now, as we get time.

01:00:36.780 --> 01:00:41.440
So say I have a constellation,
A, as binary PAM.

01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:45.230
So it takes only two values,
minus alpha and alpha.

01:00:45.230 --> 01:00:49.430
So I have these two points here,
alpha and minus alpha.

01:00:49.430 --> 01:00:56.030
My receiveds are Y, symbol Y is
X plus n, where X belongs

01:00:56.030 --> 01:01:02.570
to A, and N is Gaussian zero
mean, variance sigma squared,

01:01:02.570 --> 01:01:07.990
where sigma squared
is N_0 over 2.

01:01:07.990 --> 01:01:11.130
And now what want to do at the
receiver is given Y, you want

01:01:11.130 --> 01:01:14.610
to decide whether X was
alpha or minus alpha.

01:01:14.610 --> 01:01:17.110
That's a standard detection
problem.

01:01:17.110 --> 01:01:20.590
So how will the probability
of error look like?

01:01:20.590 --> 01:01:24.070
So suppose I transmit X equals
alpha, my conditional

01:01:24.070 --> 01:01:26.140
density of Y --

01:01:26.140 --> 01:01:27.390
let me make some room here --

01:01:32.270 --> 01:01:36.180
will be a bell shaped curve,
because of the Gaussian noise.

01:01:36.180 --> 01:01:40.670
So this is P of Y given
X equals alpha.

01:01:40.670 --> 01:01:43.830
Similarly, if I have set X
equals minus alpha, what I get

01:01:43.830 --> 01:01:45.700
is something like this.

01:01:45.700 --> 01:01:50.170
This is p of Y given X
equals minus alpha.

01:01:50.170 --> 01:01:52.132
Excuse my handwriting there.

01:01:52.132 --> 01:01:57.350
And the decision region is at
the midpoint, Y equals zero.

01:01:57.350 --> 01:01:59.880
This is a standard binary
detection problem.

01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:02.880
If Y is positive, you will say
X equals alpha was sent.

01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:07.330
If Y is negative, you will say X
equals minus alpha was sent.

01:02:07.330 --> 01:02:10.570
And your probability of error
is simply the probability of

01:02:10.570 --> 01:02:12.840
error under this --

01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:15.420
graph under these
two curves here.

01:02:15.420 --> 01:02:19.080
So we want to find what the
probability of error is.

01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:21.980
Just let me just do quickly the
calculation, in order to

01:02:21.980 --> 01:02:22.890
remind you.

01:02:22.890 --> 01:02:24.575
We'll be doing this over
and over again.

01:02:24.575 --> 01:02:25.825
We'll just do it once.

01:02:28.860 --> 01:02:32.260
Without loss in generality, I
can say this is probability of

01:02:32.260 --> 01:02:35.900
error, given X equals minus
alpha, where both the points

01:02:35.900 --> 01:02:37.220
are equally likely.

01:02:37.220 --> 01:02:39.490
So by symmetry, I
can say that.

01:02:39.490 --> 01:02:44.100
So this is the same as
probability that Y is greater

01:02:44.100 --> 01:02:46.820
than zero, given X
is minus alpha.

01:02:46.820 --> 01:02:52.320
Now Y is X plus N, so this is
same as probability that N --

01:02:55.610 --> 01:02:58.350
yeah capital N --

01:02:58.350 --> 01:02:59.310
is greater than alpha.

01:02:59.310 --> 01:03:02.170
Since N has zero mean variance
sigma squared, this is a

01:03:02.170 --> 01:03:06.618
standard Q function of
alpha over sigma.

01:03:06.618 --> 01:03:09.230
OK, so that's the probability
of error.

01:03:09.230 --> 01:03:12.310
Now, there is one bit per symbol
for each X that is one

01:03:12.310 --> 01:03:15.200
bit, so probability of error is
also same as probability of

01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:23.490
bit error, so this is also Pb of
E. So I have Pb of E equals

01:03:23.490 --> 01:03:34.720
Q of alpha over sigma, and
now, I want to basically

01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:37.400
express it as a function
of Eb/N_0, right.

01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:39.200
So what is Eb for the system?

01:03:42.540 --> 01:03:45.890
It's going to be
alpha squared.

01:03:45.890 --> 01:03:50.540
Sigma squared is now N_0 over 2,
so alpha squared over sigma

01:03:50.540 --> 01:03:55.500
squared is 2 Eb over N_0.

01:03:55.500 --> 01:04:00.920
So now my probability of bit
error is this Q function of

01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:02.170
root 2 Eb over N_0.

01:04:07.820 --> 01:04:08.580
OK?

01:04:08.580 --> 01:04:09.850
So let us plot this.

01:04:12.570 --> 01:04:16.680
So I'm on the x-axis,
I'm plotting Eb/N_0,

01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:19.640
which is in dB scale.

01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:21.920
On the y-axis, I'm
going to plot the

01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:26.070
probability of bit error.

01:04:26.070 --> 01:04:28.820
Typically, what you do is
you plot the y-axis

01:04:28.820 --> 01:04:30.690
on a semi-log scale.

01:04:30.690 --> 01:04:35.410
So this is ten to the minus six,
ten to the minus five.

01:04:35.410 --> 01:04:37.390
If you want to do this in
MATLAB, you can use this

01:04:37.390 --> 01:04:39.920
command semi-log y,
and that does it.

01:04:43.130 --> 01:04:44.570
And so on.

01:04:44.570 --> 01:04:49.070
So can anybody say what will
be a good candidate for the

01:04:49.070 --> 01:04:50.570
x-value at this point here?

01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:55.590
So what should be the Eb/N_0
at this point?

01:05:00.430 --> 01:05:01.890
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

01:05:01.890 --> 01:05:04.210
PROFESSOR: It should be the
Shannon limit, right?

01:05:04.210 --> 01:05:07.350
You cannot hope to go below
the Shannon limit.

01:05:07.350 --> 01:05:12.050
So now, what Shannon
says is that --

01:05:12.050 --> 01:05:14.580
so I'm going to plot this as
my Shannon limit here.

01:05:19.650 --> 01:05:22.460
This probability of error will
basically use the standard

01:05:22.460 --> 01:05:25.100
waterfall curve.

01:05:25.100 --> 01:05:28.670
This is 2-PAM.

01:05:31.970 --> 01:05:34.460
And if you look at the
x-coordinates, then the value

01:05:34.460 --> 01:05:38.350
at ten to the minus
five is 9.6 dB.

01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:51.370
So as a system designer, if you
care about probability of

01:05:51.370 --> 01:05:54.780
error at ten to the negative
five, then your gap to

01:05:54.780 --> 01:05:57.800
capacity, or gap to the ultimate
limit, if you will,

01:05:57.800 --> 01:06:02.665
will be this, 9.6 minus
of minus 1.59 dB.

01:06:02.665 --> 01:06:04.260
OK, I should not erase this.

01:07:02.980 --> 01:07:21.770
OK, so the first thing is at N
to the minus five, our gap to

01:07:21.770 --> 01:07:31.590
the ultimate limit is 9.6
plus 1.59 dB, and that's

01:07:31.590 --> 01:07:37.570
approximately 11.2 dB.

01:07:37.570 --> 01:07:38.650
OK?

01:07:38.650 --> 01:07:40.990
But there is one
catch to this.

01:07:40.990 --> 01:07:44.025
This particular system has a
spectral efficiency of two

01:07:44.025 --> 01:07:47.480
bits for two dimensions, whereas
if you want to achieve

01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:50.150
something close to the Shanon
limit, you have to drive the

01:07:50.150 --> 01:07:52.630
spectral efficiency
down to zero.

01:07:52.630 --> 01:07:55.750
So you might say that this
is not a fair comparison.

01:07:55.750 --> 01:07:58.770
So if you do want to make a fair
comparison, you want to

01:07:58.770 --> 01:08:02.030
fix rho to be two bits
for two dimensions.

01:08:02.030 --> 01:08:06.540
So if you fix rho for two bits
per two dimensions, you will

01:08:06.540 --> 01:08:10.460
get a limit somewhere,
not at 1.59 dB, but

01:08:10.460 --> 01:08:12.190
at some other point.

01:08:12.190 --> 01:08:18.895
This is if you fix rho2, two
bits for two dimensions.

01:08:18.895 --> 01:08:20.970
Can anybody say what
that point will be?

01:08:29.934 --> 01:08:31.939
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

01:08:31.939 --> 01:08:32.990
PROFESSOR: 3 over 2.

01:08:32.990 --> 01:08:33.939
1.5.

01:08:33.939 --> 01:08:37.304
What will it be in
the log scale?

01:08:37.304 --> 01:08:38.290
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

01:08:38.290 --> 01:08:39.450
PROFESSOR: 1.76.

01:08:39.450 --> 01:08:40.380
Good.

01:08:40.380 --> 01:08:41.810
So what we do know --

01:08:41.810 --> 01:08:43.074
if we do the calculation here.

01:08:45.819 --> 01:08:54.160
If you fix rho2, two bits for
two dimensions, your Eb/N_0,

01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:58.670
we know, is greater than 2 to
the rho minus 1 over rho,

01:08:58.670 --> 01:09:00.840
which is 3 over 2.

01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:06.260
And that is, if you remember
your dB tables, 1.76 dB.

01:09:06.260 --> 01:09:16.430
Log of 3 is like 4.7, log of 2
is like 3, so it's 1.76 dB.

01:09:16.430 --> 01:09:31.470
So in this case, your gap to the
ultimate limit is going to

01:09:31.470 --> 01:09:39.950
be 9.6 minus 1.76, which
comes out to be 7.8 dB.

01:09:42.896 --> 01:09:45.359
OK?

01:09:45.359 --> 01:09:48.159
So now, let us do the
bandwidth-limited regime.

01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:10.380
Now in bandwidth-limited regime,
the trade-off is Ps of

01:10:10.380 --> 01:10:13.290
E as a function of SNR norm.

01:10:17.950 --> 01:10:20.010
OK, so that's the trade-off
we seek for.

01:10:20.010 --> 01:10:21.320
And the baseline system
we will be

01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:22.660
using is an M-PAM system.

01:10:28.810 --> 01:10:38.890
So now, your constellation is
going to be minus alpha,

01:10:38.890 --> 01:10:43.420
alpha, 3 alpha, minus 3 alpha,
and so on, up to M

01:10:43.420 --> 01:10:45.720
minus 1 alpha --

01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:48.170
I always run out
of room here --

01:10:48.170 --> 01:10:50.810
minus M minus 1 alpha.

01:10:50.810 --> 01:10:53.170
This is your constellation.

01:10:53.170 --> 01:10:55.990
Now what's the probability of
error going to be for this

01:10:55.990 --> 01:10:57.240
constellation?

01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:03.450
Well, what's the probability
of error for each

01:11:03.450 --> 01:11:05.710
intermediate point?

01:11:05.710 --> 01:11:07.440
There are two ways you
can make an error.

01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:11.300
Say we say alpha, your noise
is either too small, so it

01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:13.330
takes you to minus alpha.

01:11:13.330 --> 01:11:17.710
Your noise is too high, so
it takes you to 3 alpha.

01:11:17.710 --> 01:11:21.410
For each one, the probability
will be Q of --

01:11:21.410 --> 01:11:24.030
this distance is 2 alpha, it
would be Q of alpha over

01:11:24.030 --> 01:11:26.820
sigma, because you will be
having your decision regions

01:11:26.820 --> 01:11:27.870
right here.

01:11:27.870 --> 01:11:30.260
So in other words, for each
intermediate point -- and

01:11:30.260 --> 01:11:32.170
there are M minus
two of this --

01:11:32.170 --> 01:11:35.520
your probability of error would
be 2 times Q of alpha

01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:37.710
over sigma.

01:11:37.710 --> 01:11:38.160
OK?

01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:39.670
And how many of them
there are?

01:11:39.670 --> 01:11:42.230
There are M minus 2 of these.

01:11:42.230 --> 01:11:44.860
And if all the points are
equally likely, and you want

01:11:44.860 --> 01:11:47.450
to find the probability of
error, you divide by M.

01:11:47.450 --> 01:11:50.420
For the two end points, the
noise can only make an error

01:11:50.420 --> 01:11:52.080
in one direction.

01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:55.820
So you get two over M times
Q of alpha over sigma.

01:11:55.820 --> 01:11:59.340
You work this out, and you have
two times M minus 1 over

01:11:59.340 --> 01:12:02.465
M, times Q of alpha
over sigma.

01:12:05.260 --> 01:12:08.310
Now, we want to find probability
of error for two

01:12:08.310 --> 01:12:12.830
symbols, because that's
what Ps of E is, OK?

01:12:12.830 --> 01:12:17.435
So what's Ps of E going to be?

01:12:17.435 --> 01:12:20.980
Well, it's -- in terms of Pr
of E, it's going to be one

01:12:20.980 --> 01:12:25.290
minus one minus Pr
of E squared.

01:12:25.290 --> 01:12:28.977
This is the probability you make
error in none of the two

01:12:28.977 --> 01:12:31.310
symbols, and 1 minus that will
be the probability of error

01:12:31.310 --> 01:12:33.730
you make in at least
one symbol.

01:12:33.730 --> 01:12:39.890
And that's going to be equal to
two Pr of E, or it's four

01:12:39.890 --> 01:12:45.270
times M minus 1 over M,
Q of alpha over sigma.

01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:53.395
Good, I did not write
on this board.

01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:04.130
So now what remains to do
is to relate alpha over

01:13:04.130 --> 01:13:06.980
sigma to SNR norm.

01:13:06.980 --> 01:13:10.360
And I had it on this
board here.

01:13:10.360 --> 01:13:16.370
SNR norm, we just did in the
previous example, for an M-PAM

01:13:16.370 --> 01:13:21.940
system is alpha squared
over 3 sigma squared.

01:13:21.940 --> 01:13:22.770
OK?

01:13:22.770 --> 01:13:29.120
So I plug that in here, so I get
Ps of E is 4 times M minus

01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:35.475
1 over M times Q of
root 3 SNR norm.

01:13:40.430 --> 01:13:46.320
And if M is large, this is
approximately 4 times Q of

01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:48.302
root 3 SNR norm.

01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:53.720
So we are plotting now
probability of error as a

01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:58.600
function of SNR norm, similar to
what we did in that part in

01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:01.590
the power-limited
regime there.

01:14:01.590 --> 01:14:05.810
So this is Ps of E as a
function of SNR norm.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:16.260
Now my Shannon limit would be at
0 dB, so this is my Shannon

01:14:16.260 --> 01:14:17.510
limit point.

01:14:20.610 --> 01:14:24.912
This is ten to the minus six,
ten to the minus five, ten to

01:14:24.912 --> 01:14:28.630
the minus four, ten to the minus
three, ten to the minus

01:14:28.630 --> 01:14:29.880
two, and so on.

01:14:33.010 --> 01:14:36.490
This is going to be the
performance of M-PAM.

01:14:36.490 --> 01:14:40.020
And again, I turn to the minus
five, which will be the kind

01:14:40.020 --> 01:14:41.840
of performance criteria
we'll be using

01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:43.090
throughout this course.

01:14:45.690 --> 01:14:51.340
You'll see that this
y-axis is 8.4 dB.

01:14:51.340 --> 01:15:01.730
So in this case, the
gap to capacity is

01:15:01.730 --> 01:15:06.000
going to be 8.4 dB.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.400
So if I want a certain spectral
efficiency and I use

01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:13.540
M-PAM, I'm 8.4 dB away from
the Shannon limit.

01:15:13.540 --> 01:15:17.490
The idea behind coding, as
someone pointed out, was to

01:15:17.490 --> 01:15:21.170
start from here and do coding
to come closer and closer to

01:15:21.170 --> 01:15:23.420
bridge this gap.

01:15:23.420 --> 01:15:24.670
OK?

01:15:27.010 --> 01:15:28.330
So are there any questions?

01:15:28.330 --> 01:15:29.580
We are almost end time.

01:15:34.390 --> 01:15:34.960
OK.

01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:36.022
I think -- yes?

01:15:36.022 --> 01:15:37.870
AUDIENCE: A perfect code would
just be literally like a step

01:15:37.870 --> 01:15:38.170
function --

01:15:38.170 --> 01:15:38.750
PROFESSOR: Right.

01:15:38.750 --> 01:15:40.025
AUDIENCE: -- all the way down.

01:15:40.025 --> 01:15:43.200
PROFESSOR: That's what
Shannon coded.

01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:46.070
OK, I think this is a natural
point to stop.

01:15:46.070 --> 01:15:47.320
We'll continue next class.
