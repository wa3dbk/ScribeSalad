00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.330
PROFESSOR: So many of you have
signed up this term.

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.940
As most of you know, this course
is now on an alternate

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.460
year basis, but it really
depends on how much interest

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:09.620
there is in it.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.780
So this is certainly very
satisfactory interest.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.420
This morning I'm just going to
go through the information

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.020
sheet logistics a little, tell
you a little bit about the

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.440
course, and then go through a
very rapid path through the

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.730
first three chapters.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.180
So hang onto your seats.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.830
But first of all,
the information.

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:44.530
One thing I did not mention in
the information sheet is that

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.290
due to the sponsorship of
OpenCourseWare and the

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:52.360
department, we are going to
have this class on TV or

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.100
videotaped for OCW in the
department archives.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.970
And I hope that's OK
with everybody.

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.020
I think at some point we'll send
out a permission sheet.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.940
Does anyone anticipate having
any problem with the camera

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.580
lingering on them or the back
of them from time to time?

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.230
I don't think this is going
to be an issue.

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.940
But if it is, either mention
it now or come

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.500
up and see me privately.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.600
As I say, I think eventually
you'll have to

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.400
sign permission sheets.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.790
Our cameraman is Tom White.

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.170
Let's give a hand to Tom.

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.760
And he promises to be as
unobtrusive as possible.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:35.110
OK.

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.750
There are four handouts
this morning.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.010
I hope you have them all.

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:40.750
First of all, the information
sheet.

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.360
Second, a little personal data
sheet that I ask you to each

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.660
fill out so we know who's
in the class and a

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.270
little bit about you.

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.840
The first problem set, which
is due a week from today.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.940
In general, problem sets will
be due on Wednesdays and

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.700
handed out on Wednesdays.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.710
And please do pass
them in on time.

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.160
We won't make any serious
attempt to grade them if they

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.490
don't come in on time.

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.874
I'll mention our philosophy
about problem

00:02:09.874 --> 00:02:11.680
sets in a little while.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.250
And then chapters one through
three, which are all sort of

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.890
warm-up chapters.

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.740
And problem set one is this kind
of warm-up exercises to

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.840
get you into context,
to get you into the

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.456
mood for this course.

00:02:25.456 --> 00:02:27.746
It doesn't have to do --

00:02:27.746 --> 00:02:28.480
well, it does.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.230
But at this point, it's more
just getting up to speed with

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.210
the language and the
environment.

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.240
The teaching assistant
is Ashish Khisti.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.880
Ashish, why don't you stand
up just so everybody

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.600
is sure to see you.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:44.950
I'm delighted to have Ashish.

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.720
He was a superb student
this course.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.230
Certainly understands
it very well.

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.930
Ashish will even be a
distinguished guest lecturer

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.510
for lectures two through four,
because I will be on vacation

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:57.670
during that time.

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.330
So you'll get to know
Ashish very well.

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.220
I think he will be able to
help you quite a bit.

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.680
His office hours we've
tentatively scheduled for

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.900
Tuesday from five to seven in
the basement area of Building

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.710
32, the Stata Center.

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:18.120
Is that going to be
OK with everybody?

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.970
Is there anybody who's --?

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.180
It's of course set that way
because the homeworks are due

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.430
on Wednesday.

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.300
That's all right?

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.830
All right.

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:29.700
We aim to please.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.100
I've already mentioned
Tom White.

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.470
I want to mention that we've
tentatively scheduled the

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.300
midterm for Wednesday, March
16, which is the Wednesday

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.430
before MIT vacation week.

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.510
And normally I've run it for two
hours to try to minimize

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:49.860
time pressure.

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.880
For 9:30 class, that's easy.

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.000
We simply start it at nine.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.690
But again, if anyone has any
personal problem with that,

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:57.940
please let me know.

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.230
You may not know
about that yet.

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.873
But I want to let you
know immediately.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.410
Prerequisite.

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:16.740
I've held to the policy of
enforcing the prerequisite,

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:19.860
which is 6.450, rigorously.

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:24.070
Not so much because
the content is

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.990
really what's needed.

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.370
This course is entitled
Principles of Digital

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.060
Communications two.

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:35.200
But what it really is is a
course on coding, modern

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.940
coding, in a communications
wrapper.

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.555
Our motivation all along will
be how to get to capacity on

00:04:43.555 --> 00:04:46.380
the additive white Gaussian
noise channel.

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.580
Within that story, we're going
to develop all the principal

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.620
classes of codes that
you would see

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:53.780
in any coding course.

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.820
But we're always going to be
measuring them by how well

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.397
they do on a particular
communications channel, the

00:05:00.397 --> 00:05:04.130
canonical additive white
Gaussian noise channel.

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:07.540
But in fact, we're not going to
use very much of what you

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:08.910
had in 6.450.

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:13.150
The point of having taken 6.450
is simply to be up to a

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.910
certain level of speed and
sophistication in dealing with

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:19.270
rather mathematical concepts.

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:23.320
As you know, 450 is rather
mathematical.

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.210
Most of the Area 1 courses
are rather mathematical.

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:27.770
This one is rather
mathematical.

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:33.510
And if you simply aren't used
to making logical arguments

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:36.130
fairly quickly and in a snap,
you're going to have trouble

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:37.330
with this course.

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.660
So that's really the reason
for a prerequisite.

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:46.890
And I have found it's important
to enforce it,

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:50.430
because we always get, each
year, a couple of people who

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.590
probably shouldn't be here.

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:56.960
So is there anyone here
who hasn't taken a

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.435
version of 450 before?

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:02.840
Yes?

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:03.460
What's your name?

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:04.710
AUDIENCE: Mesrob.

00:06:07.658 --> 00:06:09.900
I emailed you.

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:10.310
PROFESSOR: Oh.

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:11.690
So you emailed me --

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:12.650
Mesrob?

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:13.710
OK.

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:19.300
And you had taken a couple of
other very rigorous courses,

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.215
and so I'm happy with
your prerequisites.

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:33.100
The registrar told me that Mukul
Agarwal and Daniel Wang,

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:40.200
that's you, and Andrew Cross
have not had the

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.670
prerequisites.

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:44.700
Daniel?

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:46.910
What's the story?

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:49.950
AUDIENCE: I audited
[INAUDIBLE].

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:51.640
PROFESSOR: You audited 450?

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:52.440
OK.

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:55.980
Perhaps we could talk after
class about, in general, what

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:59.835
courses you've taken, and why
you think you can keep up it.

00:06:59.835 --> 00:07:01.320
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.020
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:06.990
Or just let me know how you
prefer to handle it.

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:09.490
We can do that immediately after
class in a corner of the

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:12.190
classroom, if you want.

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:13.890
And are the other
two people here?

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:15.140
Agarwal?

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:17.830
No?

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:20.670
Cross?

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:24.090
So they seem to have selected
themselves out.

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:24.790
All right.

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:25.330
Very good.

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:30.230
And everyone else here
has had 450.

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:31.480
All righty.

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:35.630
There's no text.

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:41.660
Unfortunately there's really
isn't any text that comes

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:44.580
close to covering all the
material we're going to cover.

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:50.560
Many of the individual chapters
in this course are

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:53.850
covered by various textbooks,
of course, in far greater

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:57.130
depth than I am able
to cover them here.

00:07:57.130 --> 00:08:00.070
So partly what you're getting
from me is a selection of a

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:02.060
thread of what you really
need to know, at

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:04.380
least first time through.

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:08.650
And over the years, I've
developed course notes of my

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:11.430
own, which I'm now reasonably
satisfied with.

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:16.570
At least up through the last
chapters, where we'll spend a

00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:18.530
little bit more time
this year.

00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:20.950
And so I hope that that
will be satisfactory.

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:24.220
But I do give you some
supplementary texts in here,

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:25.970
and more are coming
out all the time.

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:29.190
And part of being a graduate
student is understanding where

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:32.740
to find supplementary material
if you need to.

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:34.770
So let me know if
you ever feel --

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:36.890
if you ever want to know, where
can I read more about

00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:40.980
something, I'd be happy to
give you a suggestion.

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:42.770
Office hours I already
mentioned.

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:44.900
Problem sets.

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:49.830
They'll be weekly, except before
the exam and except in

00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:51.090
the last week to the course.

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:57.840
The purpose of the problem
sets is for you to get

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:00.000
practice in getting
up to speed.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.350
If you don't use them
that way, you're

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:03.290
not using them correctly.

00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:06.120
I absolutely don't care if you
do them together or whatever

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:08.330
method is most effective
for you to learn.

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:12.230
These are intended
for you to learn.

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:16.120
I don't recommend going in --
many of these of have been

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:20.450
offered in prior years, and the
answers are to be found

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:23.410
somewhere on the net or
in somebody's library.

00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:26.970
But as you've heard in every
other class, I don't recommend

00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:30.460
your going about
them that way.

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:34.320
Not much weight is put on
them in the grading.

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:37.500
The TA or the grader will simply
put a grade of zero,

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:38.130
one, or two.

00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:41.190
We'll be happy to discuss any
of them where you feel you

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:45.190
didn't really get it, or don't
know how to get your arms

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:48.470
around a particular problem.

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:53.430
And in fact, I wouldn't put any
weight on the homeworks,

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:55.690
except that every year students
say, well, if you put

00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:59.050
0% on the problem sets,
then we won't do them.

00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:02.470
And so I put 15% on
the problem sets.

00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:05.680
But in fact the problem
sets --

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:10.060
we do get an idea of how engaged
you are in the course

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:13.520
and how much you're getting
it from the problem sets.

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:16.820
That's important feedback, both
generally for the class

00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:20.090
and individually for
each of you.

00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:23.450
You know, there have been cases
where somebody is just

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:26.500
copying the problem set from the
previous year every week,

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:29.660
and then we can pretty well
predict that they'll bomb out

00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:32.810
on the midterm, and they do.

00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:33.660
So anyway.

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:35.630
You've been at MIT a while.

00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:38.180
This is pretty much the standard
philosophy, I think,

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:40.990
at least in Area 1.

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:45.032
Any questions about
what I just said?

00:10:45.032 --> 00:10:46.282
No?

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:51.990
The midterm.

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:56.770
Scheduled for two hours in the
Wednesday, the last class

00:10:56.770 --> 00:10:58.880
before the vacation.

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:00.590
Counts for 1/3.

00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:03.420
The final is scheduled
during finals week.

00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:05.866
I don't have control
over that.

00:11:05.866 --> 00:11:09.120
It will count for 1/2.

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:12.390
Basically, the grade comes from
adding up your scores on

00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:13.640
those two things.

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:18.130
Doing a scatter chart and
trying to make some

00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:20.360
intelligent guess.

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:24.120
Usually we get a little more
than half A's, a little less

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:26.340
than half B's.

00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:28.740
But I don't have any fixed
number in mind for that.

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:32.720
It's really, I try to do it
based on how you do, using

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:36.550
pluses and minuses
for decoration.

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:39.980
And I don't know.

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:42.440
Again, I think it's like what
you see in every other course.

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:47.540
All right.

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:51.090
The topics.

00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:56.090
What's going to be different
about 6.451 this year from

00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:59.440
2003, which is the last
time it was offered

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:02.300
for previous years?

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:03.470
Not too much.

00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:06.110
Basically, this course --

00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:07.760
originally there was a
single course, which

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:10.760
covered 6.450 and 451.

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:14.730
It evolved, got split
into two courses.

00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:18.390
And this course has pretty much
become a coding course.

00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:22.040
So you are here because you're
interested in coding, in

00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:25.030
particular for communications.

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:27.220
This is a good first course
in coding for, I

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:29.910
think, other interests.

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:32.140
Are you Andrew Cross?

00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:32.235
Yes.

00:12:32.235 --> 00:12:33.860
What is your situation
on the prerequisites?

00:12:36.695 --> 00:12:37.945
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:44.100
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:45.350
Let's talk about
it afterwards.

00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:50.932
Alright.

00:12:50.932 --> 00:12:58.190
So as I said earlier, the
course is pretty much

00:12:58.190 --> 00:13:02.850
stabilized at this point to be
a course on coding over the

00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:04.300
additive white Gaussian
channel.

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:07.380
Those of you who are here with
other interests, that's not

00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:10.250
the only place that coding
is used, I think will be

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:11.920
reasonably satisfied
with the course.

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:14.710
We're always putting it in a
communication context, but we

00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:18.380
talk about all the major classes
of algebraic block

00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:22.820
codes, convolutional codes,
tail-biting codes, capacity

00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:26.450
approaching codes, low-density
parity-check codes, lattice

00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:28.034
codes, trellis coded
modulation, if

00:13:28.034 --> 00:13:30.420
you want to get ...

00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:33.030
and all of their decoding
algorithms, which are just as

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:35.130
important as the codes
themselves.

00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:39.960
So I hope that's what you're
after, is to get a view of

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:45.130
which codes have proved to be
most important over the years.

00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:49.660
My context is communication,
but I believe you'll get

00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:52.420
exposed to most of the things
you would need, regardless of

00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:55.800
why you happen to be interested
in coding.

00:13:55.800 --> 00:14:00.380
What is going to be different
this year is I'm going to be

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:08.210
rather ruthlessly chopping out
not perfectly essential topics

00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:09.880
wherever I can through
the course.

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:12.610
And in particular, I'm going
to run through chapters one

00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:17.760
through three today,
assuming that --

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:19.350
well, one is just
introduction.

00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:24.540
Chapter two is basically how you
get from continuous time

00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:27.420
to discrete time on additive
white Gaussian noise channels.

00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:32.030
You did that fairly well in
6.450, so I assume all I need

00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:34.650
to do is basically sketch
it for you.

00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:39.910
And chapter three is proof of
the channel capacity formula,

00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:43.140
which you may or may not have
encountered somewhere else.

00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:45.980
But even if you haven't
encountered it, you're

00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:48.820
probably reasonably willing
to take it on faith.

00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:52.610
And so that allows us to get
immediately into chapter four

00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:56.300
in the next lecture, where
Ashish will be starting to

00:14:56.300 --> 00:15:00.000
work up from the smallest,
simplest little constellations

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.260
in Euclidean space, which is
where the story begins.

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:08.530
This hopefully will give us more
time at the end of the

00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:14.100
course for more on what's been
happening in the last ten

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:15.420
years or so.

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:19.000
First of all, a much more
analytical treatment of

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.480
capacity approaching codes
than I've been able

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:23.880
to give in the past.

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:24.830
The real theory.

00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:26.520
How do you design them?

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:28.770
How do they perform?

00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:29.800
Some more details.

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:32.460
Enough so that you could go
ahead and implement them, I

00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:37.540
believe, and analyze them,
and optimize them.

00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:40.070
And that's, I think, really
important in this course.

00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:42.840
Not just because that's the way
people are doing coding

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:47.380
these days, but also because
that's the end of the story.

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:50.830
After 50 years, we finally did
get to channel capacity, and

00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:54.120
this was the way we got there.

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:59.290
In addition, if we really do
well, we'll be able to do at

00:15:59.290 --> 00:16:03.620
least a week, maybe two weeks,
on codes for band limited

00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:06.740
channels, where you need
to go beyond binary.

00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:11.260
You need to send codes, at least
symbols, that have many

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:14.630
levels on them, not binary
levels, in order to send it at

00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:18.260
high spec coefficiencies, many
bits per second per Hertz,

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:22.910
which is, of course, what you
want for most wireless or

00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:25.170
wireline channels.

00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:28.170
You are able to send lots of
bits per second per Hertz.

00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:29.510
How do we do that?

00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:32.760
Again, hopefully getting
to capacity.

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:38.230
And finally, I always offer the
teaser, and for at least

00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:40.460
five years, I haven't been
able to get there.

00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:44.270
We could talk about linear
Gaussian channels.

00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:47.420
Where you get into equalization,
precoding.

00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:50.540
Other topics that are
very important.

00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:54.310
But I'm almost certain
we won't get there.

00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:57.780
And in addition, this subject,
this kind of a scalar version

00:16:57.780 --> 00:17:00.150
of what's done to a
fare-thee-well in the matrix

00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:04.660
way, in the wireless course,
6.452, which is taught in the

00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:07.180
next classroom in the next
hour and a half.

00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:10.150
So I anticipate in future the
whole equalization of

00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:11.180
precoding --

00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:14.819
intellectually, it should
be merged with Wireless.

00:17:14.819 --> 00:17:18.829
Because they do matrix versions
of all of that.

00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:21.260
On the other hand, it forms a
part of this story, which is

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:24.329
just basically point-to-point
transmission over the additive

00:17:24.329 --> 00:17:27.390
white Gaussian noise channel.

00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:27.760
All right.

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:31.170
I very much encourage questions
and feedback, and

00:17:31.170 --> 00:17:35.370
I'm always willing to be
distracted, tell stories,

00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:37.200
respond to just what's
on your mind.

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:40.380
It's much more fun for me, and
probably helps you, too.

00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:45.060
Does anybody have any questions
at this point, or

00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:46.310
observations?

00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:54.230
No?

00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:54.950
All right.

00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:57.050
We should just get into it.

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:10.160
OK.

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:14.700
So I say I always like to be
thinking of this from a

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:19.110
communications design
point of view.

00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:20.590
We are engineers.

00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:26.020
I am a communications engineer
and theorist.

00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:29.270
And what's the design problem
that we're really trying to

00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:31.650
solve in this course?

00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:35.160
The design problem is
that somebody --

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:39.790
your boss, or the FCC, or
somebody -- gives you a

00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:44.640
channel, which usually
involves some set of

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:45.890
frequencies and ...

00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:52.410
over some physical medium
and says, OK.

00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:55.790
I want you to design a
communications device, a

00:18:55.790 --> 00:19:01.550
modem, to get as much digital
information over that channel

00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:04.160
as you can.

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:08.180
So in chapter one, we talk about
a couple of channels

00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:14.480
which have been very important
for the development of coding.

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:17.526
One, for instance, the
deep space channel.

00:19:17.526 --> 00:19:20.340
The deep space channel --
what's the problem?

00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:23.270
You have a highly power-limited

00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:26.050
satellite way out there.

00:19:26.050 --> 00:19:29.120
It's got a little
tiny antenna.

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:33.700
It can use whatever frequencies
it wants.

00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:38.840
It's talking to a huge 140-foot
dish or whatever

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:41.330
somewhere in Pasadena
or somewhere

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:42.960
else around the world.

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:46.840
And that's basically
the channel.

00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:50.240
And you can send any wave form
you'd like, subject, really,

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:51.840
to power limitation.

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:55.450
This is an extreme example of
a power-limited channel.

00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:57.210
How do we characterize
such a channel?

00:19:57.210 --> 00:20:03.140
Well, frequencies are
unlimited, but the

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:04.930
signal-to-noise ratio
is very poor.

00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:09.820
You get a very tiny signal,
and you get noise in the

00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:13.390
antenna front end, which they've
done everything they

00:20:13.390 --> 00:20:17.520
can reduce it, they've cooled it
to a few degrees above zero

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:18.450
and so forth.

00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:23.450
Nonetheless, the front end noise
-- in the very first

00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:26.390
stages of amplification
are what is the noise.

00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:30.970
And you've basically got to
transmit through that.

00:20:30.970 --> 00:20:39.810
So you have a pure additive
white Gaussian noise channel,

00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:46.250
which we we'll always write as
the output of the channel Y of

00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:52.690
t is the input, X of t, plus
the noise, N of t.

00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:58.680
Which is additive, independent
of the signal, and white.

00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:00.795
The spectrum can be
taken to be flat.

00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:07.280
All right.

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:08.660
And what else do we have?

00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:20.730
We have that this has some
average power P, and this has

00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:33.620
some noise power spectral
density which is characterized

00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:37.520
by a parameter N_0, which
is basically the

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:40.150
noise power per Hertz.

00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:44.250
Per positive frequently Hertz,
as it turns out, because these

00:21:44.250 --> 00:21:46.425
things were all defined
back in the dark ages.

00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:50.830
OK.

00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:55.460
And we also, either because of
the channel specification or

00:21:55.460 --> 00:22:01.260
because ultimately, we decide
to signal in a particular

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:12.050
bandwidth, we have a bandwidth
W. Again, that's just measured

00:22:12.050 --> 00:22:14.210
over the positive frequencies.

00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:18.210
So if it goes from zero to W,
that's a baseband channel.

00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:23.350
If it goes from W_0
to W_0 plus W,

00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:26.790
that's a passband channel.

00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:28.930
But we're going to find out it
doesn't really matter where

00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:32.760
the passband is, or
the baseband.

00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:38.150
So those are three parameters
that specify an additive white

00:22:38.150 --> 00:22:40.420
Gaussian noise channel.

00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:45.010
And we can aggregate them into
a signal noise ratio.

00:22:45.010 --> 00:22:49.680
A signal-to-noise ratio is the
ratio of a signal power to a

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:50.490
noise power.

00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:54.910
In this case, the signal power,
by definition, is P.

00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:58.470
The noise power, it's
N_0 per Hertz.

00:22:58.470 --> 00:23:00.680
We're going across W Hertz.

00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:03.940
So by the way we define N_0, the
signal-to-noise ratio is

00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:07.050
just P over N_0 W. That's
the amount of noise

00:23:07.050 --> 00:23:09.230
power in the band.

00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:12.270
And there's an implicit
assumption here that only the

00:23:12.270 --> 00:23:20.180
noise in the band concerns you,
and it's one of the key

00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:24.730
results of 6.450 or equivalent
courses that out-of-band noise

00:23:24.730 --> 00:23:27.210
is irrelevant, because you know
information about what's

00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:29.530
in-band, so you may as
well filter it out.

00:23:29.530 --> 00:23:32.940
And therefore we don't have to
count any noise power that's

00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:36.280
outside the signal transmission
band or the

00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:39.440
signal space, as we would say.

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:44.980
So two key things.

00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:50.080
It's easier to keep in mind the
signal-to-noise ratio than

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:51.870
both P and N_0.

00:23:51.870 --> 00:23:55.580
By an amplifier, you could scale
both P and N_0 so really

00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:58.850
all you're interested in
is the ratio anyway.

00:23:58.850 --> 00:24:03.520
So we have these two key
parameters for a additive

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:05.080
white Gaussian noise channel.

00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:07.950
All right.

00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:12.570
A more typical kind of design
problem is, say, a --

00:24:12.570 --> 00:24:18.300
well, the telephone line modem,
which is something on

00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:21.840
which I've spent a good
part of my career.

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:24.110
Your boss says, OK.

00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:27.370
I want you to build me a modem
that sends as much data as

00:24:27.370 --> 00:24:30.830
possible over telephone lines.

00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:32.240
How would you approach
that problem?

00:24:38.650 --> 00:24:38.790
OK?

00:24:38.790 --> 00:24:40.820
This is your summer project .

00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:42.550
What would you do on
the first day?

00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:48.140
I really would like a little
feedback, folks.

00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:49.840
Makes it so much more
fun for me.

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:50.328
Yeah?

00:24:50.328 --> 00:24:53.045
AUDIENCE: Can we just tell
him he's [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:53.045 --> 00:24:54.320
frequency --

00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:55.360
we have [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:59.320
frequency, so it's not like
this time it would

00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:02.036
[INAUDIBLE].

00:25:02.036 --> 00:25:02.470
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:06.930
So you have in mind a certain
channel model.

00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:11.766
How would you verify
that channel model?

00:25:11.766 --> 00:25:14.650
AUDIENCE: Well, you put the
channel frequency response,

00:25:14.650 --> 00:25:16.390
you could measure it somehow.

00:25:16.390 --> 00:25:19.750
You could estimate it.

00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:20.080
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:25.620
You could take a sine wave
generator and run it across

00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:27.580
the frequencies, and
see how much gets

00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:28.690
through at the receiver.

00:25:28.690 --> 00:25:35.190
And you could plot some kind of
a channel response, which

00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:40.160
for a particular telephone
channel might go

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:41.920
something like that.

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:45.700
Turns out telephone channels are
designed so that they have

00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:50.170
no transmission above 4
kilohertz, because you sample

00:25:50.170 --> 00:25:53.370
them 8000 times a second
inside the network.

00:25:53.370 --> 00:25:56.140
They're are also designed
to have no DC response.

00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:59.400
So this might go from
-- this is --

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:01.760
well, I'm just drawing some
generic response.

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:05.120
And dB, I'll give you
my dB lecture later.

00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:12.300
300 to 3800 Hertz might be
something like that.

00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:14.310
And of course, if you measure
another channel, would it be

00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:16.350
exactly the same?

00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:17.900
No, but it might be
roughly the same.

00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:20.080
I mean, all these channels
are engineered

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:22.560
to pass human voice.

00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:22.740
Alright?

00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:25.580
In particular, there are now
international standards that

00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:30.260
say it's got to pass at least
between here and here with

00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:32.680
pretty good fidelity.

00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:33.010
All right.

00:26:33.010 --> 00:26:34.240
So that's the first
thing you do.

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:37.930
You develop a model
of the channel.

00:26:37.930 --> 00:26:47.090
And the key things about it,
first order are, it's nearly a

00:26:47.090 --> 00:26:48.680
linear channel.

00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:50.720
What you put in will
nearly come out.

00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:59.330
It has a certain bandwidth,
which is somewhere between

00:26:59.330 --> 00:27:02.400
2400, we used to say, way
back in the '60s.

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:06.900
Nowadays we might say we can
actually get through 3600,

00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:08.160
3700 Hertz.

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:12.880
But that's what's the order of
the channel bandwidth is.

00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:20.080
So we have W equals
3700 Hertz.

00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:24.560
And then, of course,
we have some noise.

00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:26.790
If we didn't have any noise, how
many bits per second could

00:27:26.790 --> 00:27:28.040
we get through here?

00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:33.230
Hello?

00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:35.090
Infinite, right.

00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:39.040
Send one number with
infinite precision.

00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:42.710
And that would communicate
the entire file that

00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:43.380
we wanted to send.

00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:47.545
And so we have a signal-to-noise
ratio.

00:27:47.545 --> 00:27:50.120
It's questionable whether the
noise is totally Gaussian.

00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:53.310
You've heard a telephone
channel.

00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:57.580
You know, it's some
weird stuff.

00:27:57.580 --> 00:28:01.510
But this is what our kind
of normal telephone

00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:03.570
channel would look like.

00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:06.100
I should say, greater
than this.

00:28:09.170 --> 00:28:10.350
Nowadays.

00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:11.690
Used to be not nearly
as good...

00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:12.960
Or I shouldn't say nowadays.

00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:14.920
This was true about
ten years ago.

00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:17.200
Nowadays everybody is using cell
phones, and these things

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:19.026
have all gotten terrible
again.

00:28:19.026 --> 00:28:19.380
All right?

00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:21.775
So please do not design your
modem for a cell phone.

00:28:21.775 --> 00:28:26.580
Let's plug a nice wired
connection into the wall.

00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:27.130
OK.

00:28:27.130 --> 00:28:28.780
So that's a first gross

00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:30.950
characterization of this channel.

00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:34.550
What would you then do
on the second day

00:28:34.550 --> 00:28:35.855
of your summer project?

00:28:41.450 --> 00:28:42.190
Yeah?

00:28:42.190 --> 00:28:43.440
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:46.230
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:48.320
That's a good idea.

00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:51.808
What do you have in mind in
designing a modulations key?

00:28:51.808 --> 00:28:53.058
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:59.430
PROFESSOR: A signal
constellation.

00:28:59.430 --> 00:28:59.970
All right.

00:28:59.970 --> 00:29:01.850
What signal constellation
are you going to use?

00:29:04.778 --> 00:29:06.780
PAM?

00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:07.570
QAM?

00:29:07.570 --> 00:29:08.560
Yeah?

00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:10.920
What would control
your choice?

00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:15.440
ISI might.

00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:19.680
This channel doesn't have
a flat response.

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:20.460
We might --

00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:27.470
let's say we've actually
developed a model where Y of t

00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:32.900
is X of t going through a linear
filter, convolved with

00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:36.580
some response h of
t plus N of t.

00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:42.530
So what we transmit
gets filtered.

00:29:42.530 --> 00:29:44.970
We add noise to it.

00:29:44.970 --> 00:29:48.430
And that's what we see
at the output.

00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:50.730
That's just a first
order model.

00:29:50.730 --> 00:29:54.230
This is basically the way
modems were designed for

00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:57.380
telephone channels for
many, many years.

00:29:57.380 --> 00:29:59.230
Just with that simple model.

00:29:59.230 --> 00:29:59.610
All right.

00:29:59.610 --> 00:30:03.070
So if we have a filter here, we
might have to worry about

00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:04.320
intersymbol interference.

00:30:06.970 --> 00:30:09.540
But you're not quite back
at the basic level.

00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:14.580
Let's suppose we decide that the
channel is reliable just

00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:18.550
within some particular frequency
band w, and within

00:30:18.550 --> 00:30:22.740
that band, it's more
or less flat.

00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:23.060
All right?

00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:26.540
When I talk about white Gaussian
noise, I'm always

00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:30.830
going to mean that the channel,
the noise spectral

00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:34.900
density, and the channel
response are flat within the

00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:36.150
given bandwidth.

00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:38.890
All right?

00:30:38.890 --> 00:30:41.840
So I'm not going to have to
worry about ISI at this level.

00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:44.540
Of course I will in my
telephone line modem.

00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:45.358
Yeah?

00:30:45.358 --> 00:30:48.046
AUDIENCE: So even if we want
high speed, [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:58.350
so we want a rate that would be
greater than [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:02.860
PROFESSOR: I suppose.

00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:05.150
I mean, do you have enough
information to say?

00:31:09.070 --> 00:31:14.310
AUDIENCE: Well, for example,
if we [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:17.060 --> 00:31:23.910
64 kilobits per second, can we
travel 3,700 [INAUDIBLE] of

00:31:23.910 --> 00:31:28.004
bandwidth that we need use the
bandwidth [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:31.076
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:31:31.076 --> 00:31:33.570
Is there any chance of
sending 64 kilobits

00:31:33.570 --> 00:31:34.820
through this channel?

00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:38.260
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:39.610
PROFESSOR: There is?

00:31:39.610 --> 00:31:40.860
How do you know that?

00:31:46.264 --> 00:31:48.160
AUDIENCE: If you use
[INAUDIBLE PHRASE].

00:32:05.180 --> 00:32:05.620
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:08.740
So that would be 32 level
complement --

00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:14.280
that would be five bits per
Hertz, basically, talking in

00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:17.120
terms of spectral efficiency.

00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:20.960
Times even 4000 kilohertz,
that only gives you 20 --

00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:21.872
AUDIENCE: Then a higher level.

00:32:21.872 --> 00:32:23.050
PROFESSOR: Then a
higher level.

00:32:23.050 --> 00:32:27.300
1024 level QAM.

00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:29.880
But what's going to limit you?

00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:32.135
I mean, why not make
it a million level?

00:32:32.135 --> 00:32:33.385
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:38.030
PROFESSOR: The signal-to-noise
ratio, all right?

00:32:38.030 --> 00:32:39.280
OK.

00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:42.070
Well.

00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:46.270
I suggest what you do on your
second day is you start

00:32:46.270 --> 00:32:48.120
thinking about, on
the one hand,

00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:50.370
simple modulation schemes.

00:32:50.370 --> 00:32:53.130
And I would say 32 -bit
QAM is simple in the

00:32:53.130 --> 00:32:54.720
context of this course.

00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:56.910
It has no coding.

00:32:56.910 --> 00:33:02.600
But just kind of give yourself a
baseline of what might work.

00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:05.090
But another very good
thing to do is to

00:33:05.090 --> 00:33:08.580
establish an upper limit.

00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:12.520
Now, it's kind of amazing
that we can do this.

00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:15.840
Up to 1948, no one would've
thought that it was a

00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:18.810
reasonable to say, well, there's
a certain upper limit

00:33:18.810 --> 00:33:21.260
on what we could ever transmit
through this channel.

00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:24.690
The idea was if you transmitted
fast, you'd make a

00:33:24.690 --> 00:33:25.450
lot of errors.

00:33:25.450 --> 00:33:27.920
If you slowed down, you'd
make fewer errors.

00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:30.570
And you know, there's no
hard and fast limit.

00:33:30.570 --> 00:33:39.220
But of course, what Shannon
did was to show that for

00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:42.400
mathematically well-specified
channels, of which this is

00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:47.860
one, there is a certain limiting
data rate called the

00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:49.110
channel capacity.

00:33:55.680 --> 00:34:01.240
And what the capacity is for
an additive white Gaussian

00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:03.840
noise channel, this is the
most famous formula in

00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:05.325
information theory.

00:34:05.325 --> 00:34:07.710
If we have time, I'll
derive it for you.

00:34:07.710 --> 00:34:11.159
Otherwise I encourage
you to look it up.

00:34:11.159 --> 00:34:18.389
The capacity of this channel is
entirely specified by these

00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:22.100
two parameters, bandwidth and
signal-to-noise ratio.

00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:25.949
And it's simply W times the
binary logarithm of one plus

00:34:25.949 --> 00:34:28.969
SNR in bits per second.

00:34:28.969 --> 00:34:29.449
All right?

00:34:29.449 --> 00:34:34.920
And the Shannon proved
a strong capacity

00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:36.370
theorem and a converse.

00:34:36.370 --> 00:34:39.880
The capacity theorem says,
there does exist a

00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:41.210
coding scheme --

00:34:41.210 --> 00:34:43.909
perhaps involving QAM, perhaps
involving lots

00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:45.670
of other stuff --

00:34:45.670 --> 00:34:50.110
that can get you as close as you
want in rate, for any rate

00:34:50.110 --> 00:34:55.100
less than capacity,
there exists a --

00:34:55.100 --> 00:35:02.060
let's say a coding slash
modulation scheme, slash

00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:10.660
modulation, slash detection,
slash decoding scheme --

00:35:10.660 --> 00:35:15.370
such that the probability of
error is less than or equal to

00:35:15.370 --> 00:35:19.930
epsilon, where epsilon can be
chosen as in any arbitrarily

00:35:19.930 --> 00:35:23.520
small number.

00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:23.830
All right?

00:35:23.830 --> 00:35:28.230
So if you want a probability of
error of ten to the minus

00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:32.680
five or ten to the minus ten,
however you measure it --

00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:33.640
can't be zero.

00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:36.380
Very big difference between zero
and ten to the minus ten.

00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:38.320
But if you want probability of
error of less than ten to the

00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:42.620
minus ten, then Shannon says
there exists a scheme that can

00:35:42.620 --> 00:35:47.030
get there, as long as your
rate is less than this

00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:50.610
capacity or Shannon limit.

00:35:50.610 --> 00:35:51.100
All right.

00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:54.900
So I suggest it would be a good
idea to calculate what

00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:56.150
that is for this.

00:35:58.670 --> 00:36:02.000
Now, signal-to-noise
ratio is 37 dB.

00:36:04.830 --> 00:36:07.990
Then one plus SNR is about
the same as SNR.

00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:16.770
Log2 of 37 dB, factor of
2 is 3 dB, so that's

00:36:16.770 --> 00:36:19.610
about 12 and a third.

00:36:19.610 --> 00:36:23.210
This is our first example of
why calculating in dB makes

00:36:23.210 --> 00:36:24.750
things very easy.

00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:28.660
So this is about 12 and a
third times whatever the

00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:30.380
bandwidth is.

00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:35.320
3700 Hertz, and we go through
that calculation, and we get

00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:40.490
something over 4,2000
bits per second.

00:36:40.490 --> 00:36:41.000
All right?

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:47.820
So you have no hope of going
more than 42000 bits per

00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:51.100
second, if this is, in fact,
an accurate channel model.

00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:54.640
I mean, I'm assuming that these
two numbers are correct.

00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:57.950
If this turns out to
be 50 dB, then you

00:36:57.950 --> 00:37:00.297
can go a little further.

00:37:00.297 --> 00:37:01.460
All right?

00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:01.790
Yes?

00:37:01.790 --> 00:37:03.040
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:06.010 --> 00:37:07.080
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:14.110
And it's really only true for a
perfectly flat channel that

00:37:14.110 --> 00:37:17.740
satisfies the complete
mathematical definition of a

00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:23.840
white Gaussian noise channel
within the band.

00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:28.300
I'm shocked to find
that this is --

00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:31.080
lots of people get through MIT
Communications course and

00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:34.840
never see a proof
of this formula.

00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:37.260
This is about as fundamental
as you get.

00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:40.880
That's why I include
one in this course.

00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:44.800
Or perhaps you've never even
seen the formula before.

00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:47.100
Certainly don't understand where
it's valid and where

00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:49.470
it's not valid.

00:37:49.470 --> 00:37:50.040
OK.

00:37:50.040 --> 00:38:00.420
So on the other hand, we might
try something like 32 QAM.

00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:04.060
If we know something about that,
we make it so that it

00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:05.910
fits in here.

00:38:05.910 --> 00:38:09.830
We find that we can get
maybe five bits

00:38:09.830 --> 00:38:12.800
per second per Hertz.

00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:15.510
That's something called spectral
efficiency, which in

00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:21.490
this course, we'll always
designate by rho.

00:38:21.490 --> 00:38:26.230
So we can get maybe 3000 Hertz
without having to worry about

00:38:26.230 --> 00:38:28.190
filtering too much.

00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:34.090
So we're going to have a system
that sends 3000 QAM

00:38:34.090 --> 00:38:35.940
symbols per second --

00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:40.270
3000 two-dimensional signals
per second, each one

00:38:40.270 --> 00:38:43.080
carrying five bits.

00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:48.130
And so with that, we'll get
15000 bits per second.

00:38:48.130 --> 00:38:52.340
So these kind of establish the
alpha and omega, the baseline

00:38:52.340 --> 00:38:54.820
and the ultimate limit,
of what we could

00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:55.960
do over this channel.

00:38:55.960 --> 00:39:00.690
With a simple uncoded scheme, we
would check that we can, in

00:39:00.690 --> 00:39:03.780
fact, get our desired error rate
at the signal-to-noise

00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:05.350
ratio that we have here.

00:39:05.350 --> 00:39:10.260
So we know, without sweating
hard, we could get 15000 bits

00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:10.800
per second.

00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:14.710
Shannon says we can get
42000 bits per second.

00:39:14.710 --> 00:39:17.680
Maybe we want to put a little
coding in there.

00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:22.090
How does Shannon say you could
get to this marvelous rate?

00:39:22.090 --> 00:39:25.490
He says, well, what you need
to do is to choose a very,

00:39:25.490 --> 00:39:26.740
very long code.

00:39:29.230 --> 00:39:34.570
And if you choose it the right
way and decode it in the right

00:39:34.570 --> 00:39:38.800
way, then I can prove to you
that your probability of error

00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:40.820
will be very small.

00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:44.480
Of course, Shannon's proof is
not constructive at all.

00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:47.450
If you've ever seen it, it
involves just choosing a code

00:39:47.450 --> 00:39:53.260
at random, decoding it
exhaustively by simply looking

00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:56.740
at all the two the nr code
words, and finding which one

00:39:56.740 --> 00:39:59.020
is closest to the received
signal, and

00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:00.650
that's not very practical.

00:40:00.650 --> 00:40:03.480
So there's nothing, in that
sense, practical about

00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:05.290
Shannon's theorem.

00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:11.150
But Shannon says, the way you
get there is you code.

00:40:11.150 --> 00:40:12.300
What is coding?

00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:15.200
Coding is introducing
constraints into your

00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:16.030
transmission.

00:40:16.030 --> 00:40:20.020
Uncoded is where you just send
an independent five bits in

00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:21.030
every symbol.

00:40:21.030 --> 00:40:24.190
And the next symbol is newly,
you choose it new.

00:40:24.190 --> 00:40:26.830
So there's no dependencies
between the symbols.

00:40:26.830 --> 00:40:28.850
It's just one shot
communication, again

00:40:28.850 --> 00:40:31.540
and again and again.

00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:34.360
Coding is introducing
constraints.

00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:37.720
From Shannon, it's clear you
need to introduce constraints

00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:41.170
over very, very long
sequences.

00:40:41.170 --> 00:40:44.210
Basically what we do is we take
some alphabet of all the

00:40:44.210 --> 00:40:46.420
sequences that we could possibly
send -- maybe the

00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:50.810
alphabet is all 1024 QAM
sequences that we could

00:40:50.810 --> 00:40:52.180
possibly send.

00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:56.830
And then the code, by the code,
we say we weed out a lot

00:40:56.830 --> 00:40:58.340
of those sequences.

00:40:58.340 --> 00:41:03.110
So we only send a small subset
of all sequences that

00:41:03.110 --> 00:41:04.710
we might have sent.

00:41:04.710 --> 00:41:07.920
As a result, we make sure that
there is a big distance

00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:10.780
between the sequences that
are actually in the code.

00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:13.430
The fact that there's the much
bigger distance than there is

00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:16.740
between the signal points
in any particular small

00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:21.910
constellation means that if we
do truly exhaustive maximum

00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:25.050
likelihood decoding, it's
extremely unlikely we'll

00:41:25.050 --> 00:41:27.440
confuse one sequence
for another.

00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:31.060
And therefore, we can get a very
low error probability.

00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:37.580
And the whole course is about
the history of people's

00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:45.730
efforts to realize what Shannon
said on the particular

00:41:45.730 --> 00:41:46.860
channel that we're
talking about.

00:41:46.860 --> 00:41:49.490
The additive white Gaussian
noise channel, which, as you

00:41:49.490 --> 00:41:51.980
might imagine, is the
canonical channel.

00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:55.460
But it's also proved to be a
very good model for things

00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:58.810
like the deep space channel,
the telephone line channel.

00:41:58.810 --> 00:42:01.260
In chapter one, I talk about
the history and you can get

00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:03.980
some sense for the time flow.

00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:06.960
And it really took until --

00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:12.040
well, depending on how you count
it, up to about 1995 to

00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:17.900
when people could get
effectively within tenths of a

00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:22.860
dB of the Shannon limit
and you could say

00:42:22.860 --> 00:42:24.310
the problem was cracked.

00:42:24.310 --> 00:42:26.310
And research has continued
for a little --

00:42:26.310 --> 00:42:29.200
the past ten years, and this has
been made more practical,

00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:33.410
and they've spent more channels
refined in many, many

00:42:33.410 --> 00:42:34.660
directions.

00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:38.260
But really, you could say it was
a 50 year project to take

00:42:38.260 --> 00:42:40.920
this existence theorem and make
it real in a practical

00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:42.570
engineering sense.

00:42:42.570 --> 00:42:44.430
And that's the story
of this course.

00:42:44.430 --> 00:42:46.070
I think it's a terrific story.

00:42:46.070 --> 00:42:50.120
So that's the way I like
to package the course.

00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:54.730
How are we going to get to what
Shannon said we could do?

00:42:54.730 --> 00:42:57.990
Alright, so that's
the whole story.

00:42:57.990 --> 00:43:01.460
You having a problem
hearing me?

00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:03.860
AUDIENCE: It's just the
noise in the system.

00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:04.420
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:43:04.420 --> 00:43:06.780
Well, it's probably not
an additive white

00:43:06.780 --> 00:43:08.030
Gaussian noise channel.

00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:16.180
One of the things about an
additive white Gaussian noise

00:43:16.180 --> 00:43:19.090
channel is that there's
no dependence in it.

00:43:19.090 --> 00:43:20.470
Time dependence in it.

00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:24.320
So a third channel of very very
practical interest these

00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:30.370
days is a wireless channel,
radio channel.

00:43:30.370 --> 00:43:34.830
Let's imagine it's a single
user channel.

00:43:34.830 --> 00:43:36.040
Everybody in this -- everything
in this course is

00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:38.830
going to be single user,
point-to-point.

00:43:38.830 --> 00:43:41.360
But nonetheless, the
FCC has said we

00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:43.990
can have five Megahertz.

00:43:43.990 --> 00:43:45.330
All right?

00:43:45.330 --> 00:43:48.430
And we've got to stay within
that five Megahertz up to some

00:43:48.430 --> 00:43:53.740
little slopover that won't
bother anybody.

00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:56.410
And again, your design problem
could be, well, how do you

00:43:56.410 --> 00:44:00.240
send as much data as possible
through a five megahertz

00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:02.430
wireless channel?

00:44:02.430 --> 00:44:05.470
If you take the Wireless course,
and I encourage you to

00:44:05.470 --> 00:44:08.760
do that, or even if you listen
to the last couple of

00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:12.200
lectures, I think, in 450, you
know that there's a big

00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:15.960
difference in the wireless
channel and it's time-varying.

00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:18.790
In particular, it has fading.

00:44:18.790 --> 00:44:21.690
So sometimes it's good and
sometimes it's bad.

00:44:21.690 --> 00:44:23.270
You have outages.

00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:25.710
Not characteristic of the
telephone line and the deep

00:44:25.710 --> 00:44:27.140
space channel.

00:44:27.140 --> 00:44:28.390
So that introduces -- well --

00:44:30.690 --> 00:44:33.610
a whole lot, many more
considerations.

00:44:33.610 --> 00:44:35.910
I'm not going to talk about
that in this course.

00:44:35.910 --> 00:44:39.540
For that course, it's held in
the next room immediately

00:44:39.540 --> 00:44:40.630
following this one.

00:44:40.630 --> 00:44:44.660
And I think it's an
excellent course.

00:44:44.660 --> 00:44:45.130
OK.

00:44:45.130 --> 00:44:49.020
So that's the story
of the course.

00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:53.280
We're going to go from day one
knowing nothing about how to

00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:55.760
signal through this channel,
except maybe we've taken some

00:44:55.760 --> 00:45:00.550
course that's introduced to
us words like PAM and QAM.

00:45:00.550 --> 00:45:05.080
And by the end of the course,
we're going to know how to go

00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:07.010
at the Shannon limit.

00:45:07.010 --> 00:45:09.030
And we're going to know a whole
lot of techniques at

00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:09.630
that point.

00:45:09.630 --> 00:45:11.250
We're going to know how to code,
we're going to know how

00:45:11.250 --> 00:45:14.650
to decode at least some
representative examples, which

00:45:14.650 --> 00:45:20.920
I've chosen to be the ones that
have been the most useful

00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:21.630
in practice.

00:45:21.630 --> 00:45:26.060
And they also tend to be the
most interesting in theory.

00:45:26.060 --> 00:45:26.790
OK?

00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:28.040
Is that clear?

00:45:33.850 --> 00:45:36.150
OK.

00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:39.680
Just an aside on the
first homework set.

00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:42.780
As I said, these are just
supposed to be warm-up

00:45:42.780 --> 00:45:48.120
exercises that should get you
comfortable with operating in

00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:53.710
the additive white Gaussian
noise channel, which, at least

00:45:53.710 --> 00:46:00.210
some discrete time, turns out
to be trying to code in

00:46:00.210 --> 00:46:01.500
Euclidean space.

00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:04.810
To encode and decode
in Euclidean space.

00:46:04.810 --> 00:46:07.520
And the very first thing
I do here is to

00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:10.080
give you my dB lecture.

00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:11.880
Now, how many people here
would say they're

00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:15.350
comfortable using dB?

00:46:15.350 --> 00:46:17.060
Nobody.

00:46:17.060 --> 00:46:18.310
OK.

00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:25.810
Over the years, I've tried to
encourage Bob Gallager to talk

00:46:25.810 --> 00:46:27.840
more about dB in 6.450.

00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:30.980
And now I believe he does give
the dB lecture, but I don't

00:46:30.980 --> 00:46:34.550
believe he gives it with
very much conviction.

00:46:34.550 --> 00:46:38.730
I'm convinced the dB are a
very useful thing to know

00:46:38.730 --> 00:46:43.210
about, and I think Bob had a bad
experience with dB early

00:46:43.210 --> 00:46:47.570
in life is really what
the problem is.

00:46:47.570 --> 00:46:53.620
Some army sergeant said somebody
was three dB taller

00:46:53.620 --> 00:46:56.406
than somebody else, and he was
so revolted, he never wanted

00:46:56.406 --> 00:46:58.950
to talk about dB again.

00:46:58.950 --> 00:46:59.390
OK.

00:46:59.390 --> 00:47:04.870
dB, which stands for decibel,
one tenth of a Bell --

00:47:04.870 --> 00:47:09.250
the reason B is capitalized is
it is after somebody's name,

00:47:09.250 --> 00:47:12.060
Alexander Graham Bell --

00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:15.900
are very useful whenever you
want to use logarithms.

00:47:15.900 --> 00:47:19.760
They basically are a system
of logarithms.

00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:23.980
This gets all confused with ten
log ten and 20 log ten and

00:47:23.980 --> 00:47:29.040
EE tests, but basically it's
just a very well-designed, for

00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:31.875
humans, system of logarithms.

00:47:35.930 --> 00:47:36.670
Think about it.

00:47:36.670 --> 00:47:39.570
What would be the most
convenient system of

00:47:39.570 --> 00:47:40.210
logarithms?

00:47:40.210 --> 00:47:42.740
We're going to use this whenever
we have talking about

00:47:42.740 --> 00:47:48.130
factors, or the multiplication
of a bunch of numbers.

00:47:48.130 --> 00:47:51.650
First of all, you'd want to have
it be based on the base

00:47:51.650 --> 00:47:55.342
ten number system, because
then it's --

00:47:55.342 --> 00:47:58.170
you know, we have a decimal
system, and we want to be able

00:47:58.170 --> 00:48:01.770
to very conveniently multiply
by ten, 100,

00:48:01.770 --> 00:48:04.280
1000, and so forth.

00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:07.490
So a very natural logarithm
to consider is

00:48:07.490 --> 00:48:09.550
log to the base ten.

00:48:09.550 --> 00:48:16.160
But so if we have log to the
base ten of some factor --

00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:20.860
let's say log to the base
ten of 2 is 0.3010.

00:48:20.860 --> 00:48:23.800
And in fact, you know there are
lots of tables that give

00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:26.000
logs to base ten.

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:29.880
But it's just not so easy to
remember that the log of base

00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:32.450
ten of 2 is 0.3.

00:48:32.450 --> 00:48:37.520
Basically if we take the log to
the base ten of the whole

00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:40.180
range from, say, one to
ten, that's really

00:48:40.180 --> 00:48:41.130
all we have to know.

00:48:41.130 --> 00:48:45.830
Because what we need is
one factor of ten.

00:48:45.830 --> 00:48:50.880
This goes from zero to one.

00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:51.240
OK.

00:48:51.240 --> 00:48:55.970
What we'd really like to do is
to spread this out for human

00:48:55.970 --> 00:48:57.890
factors engineering.

00:48:57.890 --> 00:49:02.250
We'd like to take ten to the
base ten, which will now map

00:49:02.250 --> 00:49:05.770
the range from one to ten
into a nice interval

00:49:05.770 --> 00:49:06.970
from zero to ten.

00:49:06.970 --> 00:49:11.850
That's very easy for people
to understand.

00:49:11.850 --> 00:49:19.530
And ten to the log10 of 2
is 3.01 and so forth.

00:49:19.530 --> 00:49:19.950
OK.

00:49:19.950 --> 00:49:25.170
So if that's why we say a factor
of 2 is equal to 3 dB.

00:49:25.170 --> 00:49:28.980
I find it's always helpful to
say "a factor of" when talking

00:49:28.980 --> 00:49:31.110
about dB, just to remind
ourselves, we're always

00:49:31.110 --> 00:49:33.100
talking about a multiplicative
factor.

00:49:33.100 --> 00:49:36.915
So a factor of alpha is
10 log10 alpha dB.

00:49:39.950 --> 00:49:43.340
Now most of you are
mathematically sophisticated

00:49:43.340 --> 00:49:46.800
enough to know this is basically
the same thing as

00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:53.300
saying log to the base ten to
the one-tenth of alpha.

00:49:53.300 --> 00:49:57.220
So we're really using a base
here, which is ten to the

00:49:57.220 --> 00:50:03.250
one-tenth point 1, which is
about 1.25 something or other.

00:50:03.250 --> 00:50:11.730
So the number whose one dB,
which is beta to the one, is

00:50:11.730 --> 00:50:15.700
about 1.25.

00:50:15.700 --> 00:50:19.810
So we're just using a log to a
certain base, which is very

00:50:19.810 --> 00:50:20.340
convenient.

00:50:20.340 --> 00:50:24.240
The base is ten to
the one-tenth.

00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:28.320
And that's all it
is, all right?

00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:31.470
Beyond that it's not
very mysterious.

00:50:31.470 --> 00:50:33.960
So I think it's very
useful just to

00:50:33.960 --> 00:50:40.790
remember a little table.

00:50:40.790 --> 00:50:44.180
alpha of one is how
much in dB?

00:50:44.180 --> 00:50:45.730
It's zero.

00:50:45.730 --> 00:50:50.300
Or I write it two ways.

00:50:50.300 --> 00:50:54.000
Round numbers, or in any
system, it's that.

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:57.670
1.25 is about 1 dB.

00:50:57.670 --> 00:51:02.820
2 is 3 dB.

00:51:02.820 --> 00:51:04.910
Let's see.

00:51:04.910 --> 00:51:08.930
3 is about 4.8 dB.

00:51:08.930 --> 00:51:09.950
4 is what?

00:51:09.950 --> 00:51:14.260
4 is just 2 squared, so
that has to be 6 dB.

00:51:14.260 --> 00:51:15.350
5 is what?

00:51:15.350 --> 00:51:18.690
5 is 10/2, so that
has to be --

00:51:18.690 --> 00:51:23.686
ten down here is 10 dB.

00:51:23.686 --> 00:51:26.530
That's exactly 10 dB.

00:51:26.530 --> 00:51:31.110
And so 5 has to be 7 dB.

00:51:31.110 --> 00:51:35.870
And 8 is 9 dB.

00:51:35.870 --> 00:51:37.360
And that's consistent,
by the way.

00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:41.350
You see then ten eighth,
which is 5/4, is

00:51:41.350 --> 00:51:44.550
1.25, which is 1 dB.

00:51:44.550 --> 00:51:48.090
And just, I find it useful
in everyday life.

00:51:48.090 --> 00:51:50.460
Maybe that makes me an
engineering nerd.

00:51:50.460 --> 00:51:53.740
But the first problem, for
instance, has to do with

00:51:53.740 --> 00:51:55.250
compound interest.

00:51:55.250 --> 00:51:59.990
If you just remember dB values
of things, you can do things

00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:03.560
like compound interest
calculations in your head.

00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:06.570
Or I gave you a more engineering
example over here.

00:52:06.570 --> 00:52:11.570
If you want to evaluate log2
of 37 dB, it's very easy.

00:52:11.570 --> 00:52:13.480
You just divide by 3.

00:52:13.480 --> 00:52:14.320
All right?

00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:19.070
So anyway.

00:52:19.070 --> 00:52:25.780
I encourage you to memorize
this short table.

00:52:25.780 --> 00:52:27.500
There's some more
things in it.

00:52:27.500 --> 00:52:30.860
And use it day by day,
and become known

00:52:30.860 --> 00:52:32.185
as a real MIT person.

00:52:38.390 --> 00:52:40.510
Why schemes?

00:52:40.510 --> 00:52:41.760
Well, why not?

00:52:44.870 --> 00:52:46.290
All right.

00:52:46.290 --> 00:52:51.580
The other problems on the
first homework set --

00:52:51.580 --> 00:52:56.060
one's a quite algebraic
construction, using Hadamard

00:52:56.060 --> 00:53:02.560
matrices of geometrical signal
sets, like biorthogonal NS

00:53:02.560 --> 00:53:08.070
orthogonal and simplex
signal sets, with a

00:53:08.070 --> 00:53:09.940
easy decoding algorithm.

00:53:09.940 --> 00:53:12.760
And that's good to know about.

00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:18.720
Next one is a QAM problem,
asking you to look at various

00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:22.140
arrangements of signal points in
two dimensions, and try to

00:53:22.140 --> 00:53:25.230
find the best ones for
various criteria.

00:53:25.230 --> 00:53:29.890
The last one has to do with
spherical shaping of large

00:53:29.890 --> 00:53:35.150
constellations, in many
dimensions, with high spectral

00:53:35.150 --> 00:53:35.730
efficiency.

00:53:35.730 --> 00:53:38.020
Many bits per second
per Hertz.

00:53:41.070 --> 00:53:41.670
OK.

00:53:41.670 --> 00:53:43.080
And that's chapter one.

00:53:53.130 --> 00:53:53.360
Ok.

00:53:53.360 --> 00:53:55.010
Chapter two we'll
do very quickly.

00:53:55.010 --> 00:53:57.150
And then I could see we're
not going to get to

00:53:57.150 --> 00:53:59.640
chapter three at all.

00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:00.760
And that's fine.

00:54:00.760 --> 00:54:02.010
You can read it.

00:54:04.720 --> 00:54:08.150
Ashish, if you want to say a
word about chapter three next

00:54:08.150 --> 00:54:10.260
time, that would be fine.

00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:20.330
Chapter two is really about
given a continuous time

00:54:20.330 --> 00:54:30.840
additive white Gaussian noise
channel, with model Y of t

00:54:30.840 --> 00:54:37.320
equals X of t plus N of t, and
here we have a certain power

00:54:37.320 --> 00:54:41.150
and we have a certain bandwidth
limitation W, the

00:54:41.150 --> 00:54:44.560
same things we were using
before, here we have a certain

00:54:44.560 --> 00:54:46.740
power spectral density N_0.

00:54:46.740 --> 00:54:49.165
So there are the parameters
of the channel.

00:54:52.040 --> 00:55:02.390
Or I've collapsed them into two
parameters, SNR and W. How

00:55:02.390 --> 00:55:09.410
can we convert this to a
discrete time additive white

00:55:09.410 --> 00:55:15.110
Gaussian noise channel, which
will be a channel

00:55:15.110 --> 00:55:16.970
model like this --

00:55:16.970 --> 00:55:24.140
a sequence of symbols Yk is
equal to a sequence of

00:55:24.140 --> 00:55:32.000
transmitted symbols Xk plus a
sequence of noise symbols Nk.

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:43.950
Where again, this is going
to be IID Gaussian.

00:55:43.950 --> 00:55:46.630
That's what "white" is
in discrete time.

00:55:46.630 --> 00:55:48.830
Independent Identically
Distributed

00:55:48.830 --> 00:55:51.570
Gaussian random variables.

00:55:51.570 --> 00:55:56.346
This is going to have some
variance S_N, it's going to

00:55:56.346 --> 00:55:59.830
have some power constraint
S_X.

00:55:59.830 --> 00:56:04.820
We don't specifically see a
bandwidth in here, but the

00:56:04.820 --> 00:56:07.240
bandwidth is essentially
how many

00:56:07.240 --> 00:56:10.060
symbols we get per second.

00:56:10.060 --> 00:56:14.570
And I think all of you should
have a sense that a bandwidth

00:56:14.570 --> 00:56:20.230
of W translates, through the
sampling theorem, or through

00:56:20.230 --> 00:56:25.200
PAM modulation, or something
else, is roughly equivalent in

00:56:25.200 --> 00:56:30.360
discrete time to two W real
symbols per second, or to W

00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:34.260
complex symbols per second.

00:56:34.260 --> 00:56:37.200
Now the -- sorry, did
I screw you up?

00:56:41.780 --> 00:56:43.030
Do I need to readjust?

00:57:03.210 --> 00:57:03.960
All right.

00:57:03.960 --> 00:57:05.210
Perfect.

00:57:07.780 --> 00:57:14.650
There is a particular
way we can --

00:57:14.650 --> 00:57:15.440
well.

00:57:15.440 --> 00:57:20.650
So we're going to show that
these two, the continuous time

00:57:20.650 --> 00:57:23.390
and the discrete
time channel --

00:57:23.390 --> 00:57:26.310
if we have a continuous time
channel, we can get a discrete

00:57:26.310 --> 00:57:31.690
time channel like that, where
the values of the parameters,

00:57:31.690 --> 00:57:34.810
signal-to-noise ratio, for
instance, translate in a

00:57:34.810 --> 00:57:39.240
natural way and that
they're the same.

00:57:39.240 --> 00:57:42.530
And furthermore, where we carry
as much information on

00:57:42.530 --> 00:57:44.360
the discrete time channel
as we do on a

00:57:44.360 --> 00:57:45.360
continuous time channel.

00:57:45.360 --> 00:57:48.560
So there's no loss of optimality
or generality in

00:57:48.560 --> 00:57:50.140
doing this.

00:57:50.140 --> 00:57:57.020
Now you've all, with a couple of
exceptions, taken 6.450, so

00:57:57.020 --> 00:57:59.410
you know how to do this.

00:57:59.410 --> 00:58:07.070
One way of doing this in a
fairly engineering sense is

00:58:07.070 --> 00:58:08.320
orthonormal PAM --

00:58:11.200 --> 00:58:14.010
Pulse Amplitude Modulation.

00:58:14.010 --> 00:58:18.630
And you should know
how this goes.

00:58:18.630 --> 00:58:23.540
We're going to take in a
sequence X, which I might

00:58:23.540 --> 00:58:29.340
write out as a sequence of real
symbol levels Xk, perhaps

00:58:29.340 --> 00:58:31.150
chosen from a PAM alphabet.

00:58:31.150 --> 00:58:34.130
I'm not even going to specify.

00:58:34.130 --> 00:58:35.780
And what do I need
to know here?

00:58:35.780 --> 00:58:40.490
This is going to be at two W
symbols per second, real

00:58:40.490 --> 00:58:41.740
symbols per second.

00:58:44.910 --> 00:58:45.350
OK.

00:58:45.350 --> 00:58:47.640
That's my transmitted sequence
that I want to get

00:58:47.640 --> 00:58:48.890
to the other end.

00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:53.820
PAM modulator --

00:58:53.820 --> 00:58:58.280
so this is PAM modulator --

00:58:58.280 --> 00:59:04.610
is specified by a certain
pulse response p of t.

00:59:04.610 --> 00:59:13.220
and I'm going to require that
this be orthonormal in the

00:59:13.220 --> 00:59:14.230
following sense.

00:59:14.230 --> 00:59:20.940
That the inner product between
p of T minus kT and p of T

00:59:20.940 --> 00:59:26.490
minus jT is equal to the
chronic or delta.

00:59:26.490 --> 00:59:27.250
Delta kj.

00:59:27.250 --> 00:59:33.070
So that the time shifts of this
single basic pulse by T,

00:59:33.070 --> 00:59:41.710
where T equals one over two w,
the symbol interval, are going

00:59:41.710 --> 00:59:44.050
to be orthogonal to each
other, and what's more,

00:59:44.050 --> 00:59:44.770
orthonormal.

00:59:44.770 --> 00:59:54.350
So in effect, I've got a signal
space consisting of all

00:59:54.350 --> 00:59:59.180
the linear combinations of the
time shifts of p of T by

00:59:59.180 --> 01:00:02.390
integer values of T, and I'm
going to send something that's

01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:06.550
in that signal space simply by
amplitude modulating each one

01:00:06.550 --> 01:00:08.770
that comes along.

01:00:08.770 --> 01:00:09.410
All right.

01:00:09.410 --> 01:00:13.760
So what I get out here is the
continuous time signal X of T,

01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:17.754
sum of Xk p of T minus kT.

01:00:17.754 --> 01:00:19.004
That's what the modulator
does.

01:00:25.470 --> 01:00:30.290
Then the channel, continuous
time channel -- so this is

01:00:30.290 --> 01:00:31.900
discrete time here.

01:00:31.900 --> 01:00:34.570
Now I'm into continuous time.

01:00:34.570 --> 01:00:40.160
The channel is going to add
white Gaussian noise N of T

01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:49.500
with N_0 power spectral density
to give me channel

01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:55.120
output Y of T is X
of T plus N of T.

01:00:55.120 --> 01:01:01.800
And now I need a receiver to
get back to discrete time.

01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:13.180
The receiver will simply be a
sampled matched filter, which

01:01:13.180 --> 01:01:18.420
has many properties which
you should recall.

01:01:18.420 --> 01:01:20.460
Physically what does
it look like?

01:01:20.460 --> 01:01:26.740
We pass Y of T through p of
minus T. The matched filter's

01:01:26.740 --> 01:01:27.740
turnaround in time.

01:01:27.740 --> 01:01:30.250
What it's doing is performing
an inner product.

01:01:30.250 --> 01:01:38.100
We then sample at T samples
per second.

01:01:38.100 --> 01:01:40.300
Perfectly phased.

01:01:40.300 --> 01:01:45.960
And as a result, we get out
some sequence y equal Yk.

01:01:48.740 --> 01:01:55.060
And the purpose of this is so
that Yk is the inner product

01:01:55.060 --> 01:02:00.190
of Y of t with p
of T minus kT.

01:02:08.730 --> 01:02:13.190
And you should be aware that
this is a realization --

01:02:13.190 --> 01:02:16.710
this is a correlator-type
inner product.

01:02:16.710 --> 01:02:19.490
Correlate and sample
inner product.

01:02:19.490 --> 01:02:20.920
All right?

01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:25.140
So what are some of the
properties that you developed

01:02:25.140 --> 01:02:30.700
ad nauseum in 6.450?

01:02:30.700 --> 01:02:37.520
First of all, if we take the
signal part of this, and we

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:42.400
have the sampler phasing right,
what do we get out for

01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:43.820
the signal part of Yk?

01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:51.470
We have X of T is this.

01:02:51.470 --> 01:02:56.560
If we correlate that against,
let me say, p of T minus jT

01:02:56.560 --> 01:03:00.320
for all j, we're going to get
zero for everything except for

01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:01.510
the desired sample.

01:03:01.510 --> 01:03:03.920
For the desired sample, we're
just going to get the desired

01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:05.150
sample out.

01:03:05.150 --> 01:03:10.540
So from this, we get Yk
is equal to Xk plus

01:03:10.540 --> 01:03:13.910
the noise term, Nk.

01:03:13.910 --> 01:03:16.330
In other words, there's no
intersymbol interference.

01:03:22.790 --> 01:03:25.110
The noise term --

01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:32.790
by taking these inner products,
what are these?

01:03:32.790 --> 01:03:39.570
These are the coefficients of yK
in the signal space, under

01:03:39.570 --> 01:03:47.200
-- these are an orthonormal
expansion of Y of T. Those

01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:51.650
components which lie in
the signal space.

01:03:51.650 --> 01:03:53.390
Can we ignore the components
that don't lie

01:03:53.390 --> 01:03:55.350
in the signal space?

01:03:55.350 --> 01:03:55.610
Yes.

01:03:55.610 --> 01:03:58.370
If it's out of white Gaussian
noise by the theorem of

01:03:58.370 --> 01:04:00.670
irrelevance or whatever
it was called.

01:04:00.670 --> 01:04:08.910
There is no information about
the Xs contained in any part

01:04:08.910 --> 01:04:12.988
of Y or T that is orthogonal
to the signal space, in the

01:04:12.988 --> 01:04:15.450
orthogonal space.

01:04:15.450 --> 01:04:18.720
So we simply take the parts that
are in the signal space.

01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:24.230
And another property is that
this is white Gaussian noise.

01:04:24.230 --> 01:04:34.860
Then Nk is simply an IID jointly
Gaussian sequence with

01:04:34.860 --> 01:04:42.060
variance S_N equal to N_0 over
2 if the power of spectral

01:04:42.060 --> 01:04:43.310
density here was N_0.

01:04:52.350 --> 01:04:55.610
And one other property of I
should have mentioned here is

01:04:55.610 --> 01:04:59.650
that again by the orthonormal
property, as you would think

01:04:59.650 --> 01:05:03.920
intuitively, if we sent two W
symbols per second, and each

01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:11.242
one is limited to power
S_X, then this will

01:05:11.242 --> 01:05:12.492
have power 2 W S_X.

01:05:17.830 --> 01:05:20.040
The powers are the same
in discrete time

01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:23.570
and continuous time.

01:05:23.570 --> 01:05:29.940
So what do I get?

01:05:29.940 --> 01:05:33.620
Let me now show the SNR.

01:05:36.206 --> 01:05:41.785
Let me compute it in discrete
time and in continuous time.

01:05:41.785 --> 01:05:52.780
The SNR in discrete time is
2 W S_X over S_N, which

01:05:52.780 --> 01:05:56.320
was N_0 over 2.

01:06:04.860 --> 01:06:07.020
I'm not seeing the two's fall
in the right place.

01:06:07.020 --> 01:06:08.270
What am I doing wrong?

01:06:12.210 --> 01:06:15.730
So this is the power.

01:06:23.220 --> 01:06:26.640
Discrete time and
signal-to-noise ratio is just

01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:29.370
S_X over S_N.

01:06:29.370 --> 01:06:34.700
Now S_X is P over 2W.

01:06:34.700 --> 01:06:38.744
S_N is N_0 over 2.

01:06:38.744 --> 01:06:40.046
Now I'm happy.

01:06:40.046 --> 01:06:42.380
It's P over W N_0.

01:06:42.380 --> 01:06:47.626
Continuous time is
p over W N_0.

01:06:47.626 --> 01:06:48.090
OK.

01:06:48.090 --> 01:06:49.690
The point is, the
signal-to-noise

01:06:49.690 --> 01:06:52.194
ratio is the same.

01:06:55.050 --> 01:07:06.365
In discrete time, talking about
bandwidth, the bandwidth

01:07:06.365 --> 01:07:10.119
is really 2W symbols
per second.

01:07:10.119 --> 01:07:15.990
So that's our measure of
bandwidth in discrete time.

01:07:15.990 --> 01:07:22.655
And that is approximately
equal to W Hertz

01:07:22.655 --> 01:07:23.625
in continuous time.

01:07:23.625 --> 01:07:25.565
Now, I haven't proved that
to you yet, have I?

01:07:29.970 --> 01:07:34.890
How to prove that we can
get a bandwidth as

01:07:34.890 --> 01:07:38.200
small as W but no smaller.

01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:43.140
Again, you've done this in
6.450, so I hope I can just

01:07:43.140 --> 01:07:44.390
remind you.

01:07:46.552 --> 01:07:55.350
If the shifts of p of T are
orthonormal, that says

01:07:55.350 --> 01:08:11.920
something about p of T star p of
T, which is the correlation

01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:14.270
of p of T with itself.

01:08:14.270 --> 01:08:22.010
It means g of T has to be 1 to
equal 0, and it has to be 0 at

01:08:22.010 --> 01:08:25.589
all other times, at all
other integer times.

01:08:28.790 --> 01:08:35.420
Which means the Fourier
transform, power spectral

01:08:35.420 --> 01:08:44.500
density of p of T, it has to
satisfy the Aliasing Theorem,

01:08:44.500 --> 01:08:50.680
or the zero ISI, the Nyquist
criterion for zero ISI, which

01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:55.350
basically means the alias
version of the power spectral

01:08:55.350 --> 01:09:06.260
density of this has to add up
to a perfect brick wall

01:09:06.260 --> 01:09:11.504
response between 1 over 2T minus
1 over 2T and 1 over 2T

01:09:11.504 --> 01:09:13.810
in the frequency domain.

01:09:13.810 --> 01:09:16.695
And there are simple ways
to make it do that.

01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:25.939
Which is simply to have a
roll-off, a real frequency

01:09:25.939 --> 01:09:29.470
response, with a roll-off that's
really sharp as you

01:09:29.470 --> 01:09:32.380
like above 1 over 2T.

01:09:32.380 --> 01:09:44.729
But so we can say the nominal
Nyquist bandwidth equals 1

01:09:44.729 --> 01:09:51.020
over 2T, or T is 1 over 2W.

01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:59.510
So it's W.

01:09:59.510 --> 01:10:03.920
So the moral of this
is that we can

01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:07.840
design orthonormal pulses.

01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:12.380
If we have a similar interval of
T equals 1 over 2W, we can

01:10:12.380 --> 01:10:15.440
design an orthonormal signal
set that satisfies this

01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:24.500
condition for any bandwidth
that's not much greater than

01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:27.570
W. All right?

01:10:27.570 --> 01:10:31.690
And it's obvious from the
Aliasing theorem that we can't

01:10:31.690 --> 01:10:37.520
do it if we try to choose some
bandwidth that's less than W.

01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:43.140
So that's what justifies our
saying, if we are 2M symbols

01:10:43.140 --> 01:10:46.000
per second, we're going to have
to use at least W Hertz

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:47.960
of bandwidth.

01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:51.760
But we don't have to use very
much more than W Hertz of

01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:55.530
bandwidth if we're using
orthonormal PAM as our

01:10:55.530 --> 01:10:58.220
signaling scheme.

01:10:58.220 --> 01:11:03.400
So we call this the
nominal bandwidth.

01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:06.270
In real life, there will
be a little roll-off --

01:11:06.270 --> 01:11:07.620
five percent, ten percent.

01:11:11.080 --> 01:11:15.425
And that's a fudge factor in
going from discrete time to

01:11:15.425 --> 01:11:16.060
continuous time.

01:11:16.060 --> 01:11:22.182
But it's fair that we can get
as close to W as we like.

01:11:22.182 --> 01:11:25.668
Certainly in the approaching
Shannon limit theoretically,

01:11:25.668 --> 01:11:29.747
we would say that we can get as
close to W as we need to, I

01:11:29.747 --> 01:11:32.110
should specify.

01:11:32.110 --> 01:11:33.360
All right?

01:11:37.740 --> 01:11:43.590
So there's one other parameter
that Ashish is going to be

01:11:43.590 --> 01:11:48.160
talking a lot more about in
the next lectures which is

01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:49.934
called spectral efficiency.

01:11:54.290 --> 01:11:58.634
So far I haven't told you what
information the sequence of

01:11:58.634 --> 01:12:01.410
symbols is carrying.

01:12:01.410 --> 01:12:05.880
But let's suppose it's carrying
R bits per second.

01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:06.090
All right?

01:12:06.090 --> 01:12:06.910
We have a modem.

01:12:06.910 --> 01:12:10.200
It's a 64000 bits per second
modem or whatever.

01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:12.260
R is 64000.

01:12:12.260 --> 01:12:15.090
Or whatever it is.

01:12:15.090 --> 01:12:18.371
My objective is to make R as
high as possible subject to

01:12:18.371 --> 01:12:20.060
the Shannon limit.

01:12:20.060 --> 01:12:25.540
If I am sending R bits per
second across a channel which

01:12:25.540 --> 01:12:30.260
is W Hertz Y, in continuous
time, I'm simply going to

01:12:30.260 --> 01:12:33.200
define, I'm always going
to write this as rho.

01:12:36.952 --> 01:12:42.310
And I'm going to write it simply
as a rate divided by

01:12:42.310 --> 01:12:44.020
the bandwidth.

01:12:44.020 --> 01:12:46.290
So my telephone line
case, for instance.

01:12:46.290 --> 01:12:52.078
If I was sending 40000 bits
per second in 3700 Hertz

01:12:52.078 --> 01:12:57.300
bandwidth, I'd be sending 12
bits per second per Hertz.

01:12:57.300 --> 01:13:00.360
That's why we say that.

01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:01.860
That's clearly a key thing.

01:13:01.860 --> 01:13:04.360
How much data can I jam in?

01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:06.890
We expect it to go linearly
with the bandwidth.

01:13:06.890 --> 01:13:12.350
Rho is the measure of how much
data per unit of bandwidth.

01:13:12.350 --> 01:13:17.500
What does that translate
into in discrete time?

01:13:17.500 --> 01:13:22.650
Well, I'm dividing
up this rate into

01:13:22.650 --> 01:13:25.680
2W symbols per second.

01:13:25.680 --> 01:13:28.690
How many bits am I sending
per symbol?

01:13:31.470 --> 01:13:35.115
I'm sending R over
2W per symbol.

01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:47.330
So simply rho over two bits
per symbol, or since I'm

01:13:47.330 --> 01:13:50.510
always going to think of
Euclidean space, I will often

01:13:50.510 --> 01:13:53.160
write that as dimension--

01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:56.495
rho over 2 bits per dimension.

01:13:56.495 --> 01:13:56.990
All right.

01:13:56.990 --> 01:14:01.310
Well that's not the exact
translation I like.

01:14:01.310 --> 01:14:04.920
I'd like to talk in
terms of rho.

01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:09.002
So here, rho can be evaluated
at the number of bits I'm

01:14:09.002 --> 01:14:12.078
sending per two symbols,
or per two dimensions.

01:14:16.780 --> 01:14:16.960
All right.

01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:23.492
So for the discrete time system,
our major spectral

01:14:23.492 --> 01:14:25.862
efficiency is just going to be
the number of bits I'm sending

01:14:25.862 --> 01:14:27.284
every two dimensions.

01:14:30.140 --> 01:14:33.320
It turns out if you get into
this game, you feel that two

01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:34.210
dimensions are more

01:14:34.210 --> 01:14:36.980
fundamental than one dimension.

01:14:36.980 --> 01:14:43.040
Which may be a manifestation
of the fact that complex is

01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:46.100
more fundamental than real.

01:14:46.100 --> 01:14:49.080
Really we want to talk about
the amount of information

01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:55.654
we're sending per a single
complex dimension, or we can

01:14:55.654 --> 01:14:57.304
say two real dimensions.

01:14:57.304 --> 01:14:59.660
Geometrically they amount
to the same thing.

01:14:59.660 --> 01:15:02.760
Again, in the notes, there are
discussions about how you go

01:15:02.760 --> 01:15:05.300
back and forth, and so forth.

01:15:05.300 --> 01:15:09.840
So the bottom line here is
that we can talk about

01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:11.760
spectral efficiency, which
is obviously a

01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:13.310
continuous time concept.

01:15:13.310 --> 01:15:16.470
But we can talk about it in
the discrete time domain.

01:15:16.470 --> 01:15:19.100
And what it's going to mean
simply is the rate that we're

01:15:19.100 --> 01:15:22.084
managing to send, by particular
scheme, if it's per

01:15:22.084 --> 01:15:23.290
two dimensions.

01:15:23.290 --> 01:15:27.425
For instance, 32 QAM has a
spectral efficiency of--

01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:36.745
I didn't make myself
clear at all.

01:15:36.745 --> 01:15:38.245
AUDIENCE: Five bits per two.

01:15:38.245 --> 01:15:41.280
PROFESSOR: Five bits per two
dimensions, all right?

01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:45.600
So that's the basic spectral
efficiency of a 32 PAM

01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:46.650
modulation scheme.

01:15:46.650 --> 01:15:49.760
2 PAM, plus or minus one.

01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:52.384
What's the spectral efficiency
of that if it's for two

01:15:52.384 --> 01:15:53.634
dimensions?

01:15:55.550 --> 01:15:58.850
It's a trick question.

01:15:58.850 --> 01:16:01.765
One bit per one dimension.

01:16:01.765 --> 01:16:05.020
It's two bits per
two dimensions.

01:16:05.020 --> 01:16:10.400
If it's 2 PAM, it's actually
the same thing as 4 QAM,

01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:14.860
because 4 QAM is just
doing 2 PAM place in

01:16:14.860 --> 01:16:17.800
two successive symbols.

01:16:17.800 --> 01:16:23.882
So 2 PAM, you could send two
bits per two dimensions.

01:16:23.882 --> 01:16:26.542
4 QAM is also two bits per
two dimensions Ok.

01:16:30.470 --> 01:16:32.020
Similarly for any
[UNINTELLIGIBLE], we'll be

01:16:32.020 --> 01:16:35.170
talking about codes which
cover many dimensions.

01:16:35.170 --> 01:16:40.730
If you send R bits in N
dimensions, then the spectral

01:16:40.730 --> 01:16:46.130
efficiency is going to be 2R
over N. So R over N in one

01:16:46.130 --> 01:16:49.040
dimension, 2R over N
in two dimensions.

01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:52.670
I guess initially, this
catches people up.

01:16:52.670 --> 01:16:56.600
Because it's more difficult to
normalize for two dimensions

01:16:56.600 --> 01:16:57.750
than for one dimension.

01:16:57.750 --> 01:16:59.610
But come on, suck it up.

01:16:59.610 --> 01:17:01.215
You're a graduate
student at MIT.

01:17:01.215 --> 01:17:04.170
You can do it for
two dimensions.

01:17:04.170 --> 01:17:09.340
And I assert that it really
is the more natural thing.

01:17:09.340 --> 01:17:12.550
In particular, makes this nice
correspondence between

01:17:12.550 --> 01:17:15.020
discrete and noncontinuous
time parameters.

01:17:15.020 --> 01:17:17.232
So the SNR is the same.

01:17:17.232 --> 01:17:19.982
The bandwidth has different
interpretations, but we're

01:17:19.982 --> 01:17:22.928
talking with W in both cases.

01:17:22.928 --> 01:17:28.200
Spectral efficiency, we can
measure it as either discrete

01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:30.192
time or continuous time.

01:17:30.192 --> 01:17:32.300
And oh, by the way.

01:17:32.300 --> 01:17:36.671
What is the channel capacity
formula in terms of spectral

01:17:36.671 --> 01:17:38.643
efficiency?

01:17:38.643 --> 01:17:45.180
The channel capacity was
basically the data rate has to

01:17:45.180 --> 01:17:50.210
be less than W log2
of one plus SNR.

01:17:52.900 --> 01:17:54.924
Find an equivalent way.

01:17:54.924 --> 01:17:58.830
So this is writing things in
terms of bits per second, or

01:17:58.830 --> 01:18:04.210
equivalently rho, which is R
over W, has to be less than

01:18:04.210 --> 01:18:08.350
log2 of one plus SNR.

01:18:08.350 --> 01:18:12.450
This is in bits per
second per Hertz.

01:18:12.450 --> 01:18:16.893
Or in discrete time, we have the
same formula, except this

01:18:16.893 --> 01:18:20.060
becomes 50 bits per
two dimensions.

01:18:20.060 --> 01:18:23.098
And so things have been
normalized so that now you

01:18:23.098 --> 01:18:25.344
only have a single parameter
to worry about.

01:18:25.344 --> 01:18:27.340
What special efficiencies
can you achieve?

01:18:27.340 --> 01:18:31.560
It is purely a matter of
what SNR you have.

01:18:31.560 --> 01:18:35.540
Telephone line channel 37 dB,
then you get spectral

01:18:35.540 --> 01:18:37.651
efficiency of 12 and one-third
by Shannon.

01:18:40.950 --> 01:18:42.400
OK.

01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:46.200
So I'm sorry not to be able to
give you the very lovely

01:18:46.200 --> 01:18:50.193
derivation of this formula as
a little bit of culture.

01:18:50.193 --> 01:18:52.445
I encourage you to read
chapter three.

01:18:52.445 --> 01:18:54.500
You will not be held responsible
for any of these

01:18:54.500 --> 01:18:55.850
first three chapters.

01:18:55.850 --> 01:18:59.132
They're all more or less
just for orientation.

01:18:59.132 --> 01:19:02.480
Next time, Ashish will get
into the real stuff.

01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:03.730
Any final questions?

01:19:07.640 --> 01:19:08.920
OK.

01:19:08.920 --> 01:19:10.170
See you in two weeks.
