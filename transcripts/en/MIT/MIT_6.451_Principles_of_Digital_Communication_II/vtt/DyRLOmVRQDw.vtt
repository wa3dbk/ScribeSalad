00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.660
PROFESSOR: The topic of this
chapter is finding trellis

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:08.460
representations for block codes,
in particular linear

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:09.120
block codes.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.270
We're looking only at binary
block codes, except one of the

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:16.830
homework problems looks at MDS
codes over ground field of q.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.440
The principles are the same for
general Fq or in fact for

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.070
group codes.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.320
We're looking for minimal
trellis representations.

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:33.280
And so just to review our line
of thought, basically we

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.900
proved a basic theorem called
the state space theorem that

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:43.730
tells us that there is a vector
space over the ground

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.330
field at any time which we can
identify with the state space.

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.590
It has a certain dimension.

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:55.710
And we got a little formula in
terms of subcodes for the

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.850
dimension of the state space.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.830
We set up a little generator
matrix where we isolated the

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.170
past part of the code with
respect to a certain cut time

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.120
future part of the code,
generators for that.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.880
We subtract those
generators out.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:12.610
What's left?

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.950
The number of generators is the
number of generators it

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.950
takes to generate the state
space, in other words the

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.850
dimension of the state space.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.770
So we got a theorem on the
dimension of the state space

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.330
at any time.

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.300
And then we found a nifty little
algorithm to find a --

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.260
to determine the dimensions of
the state spaces at all times,

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.080
the minimal state spaces.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.440
And in fact we can use this
algorithm to construct a

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.095
minimal trellis realization.

00:01:48.095 --> 00:01:50.180
The algorithm involves a

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.450
trellis-oriented generator matrix.

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.560
And the idea here turns
out to be very simple.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.060
All you do is you find any
generator matrix for your

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.610
linear block code, and
you reduce it to

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.910
trellis-oriented form.

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.009
Trellis-oriented form means that
the generators have as

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.720
short a span as possible.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.750
It's a minimum span
generator matrix.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.060
And we do that just in a greedy
fashion by any time we

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.770
have an opportunity to add two
generators together such that

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.880
either their starting position
cancels, or their end position

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.400
cancels, we do it.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.360
And out of that we get a shorter
generator, and we can

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.100
replace one of the two
generators in the

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.730
combination by that.

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.290
We can keep shortening
everything up.

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.880
The algorithm must terminate at
the point where no further

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.130
shortening is possible.

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.750
And that is explicitly the
point at which all the

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.900
starting times of the generators
are different, and

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.000
all the ending times of all the
generators are different.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.130
For example, here's a

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.660
trellis-oriented generator matrix.

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.680
The starting times,
the spans of the

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.820
generators, are like this.

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.600
The active times, starting
times --

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.180
there's the starting time of
this one, and its ending time.

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.150
Here's the starting time
of the next one,

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.530
and its ending time.

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.130
The starting time of the
next one, and its

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.920
ending time is here.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.930
And the starting time
of this one, and its

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.260
ending time is here.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.920
We're not always going to find
that the starting and ending

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.180
times are disjoint.

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.630
This happens, it turns
out, because this

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.500
is a self-dual code.

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.130
In a self-dual code, you will
always get this each time,

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.190
either a starting time
or an ending time.

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.410
But that's not a general
property.

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:51.425
For instance, another example
that we've used is, say, the 8

00:03:51.425 --> 00:03:56.010
7 2 single parity check code.

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.880
What are its generators?

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:08.240
Its generators look like
this, dot, dot, dot,

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.190
down to 0, 0, 1, 1.

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.130
That's a set of trellis-oriented
generators

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:16.990
with starting time, ending
time, the first one here.

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:20.390
Starting time, ending time
of the second one there.

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:24.570
So in general for this one,
every time is a starting and

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:30.310
ending time up to here, where
every intermediate time is

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.690
both the starting and
an ending time.

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:38.850
So it could happen that way,
or another example would be

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:44.870
the 8 1 8 repetition code.

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.590
What's a trellis-oriented
generator matrix for that?

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:48.545
It only has one generator.

00:04:48.545 --> 00:04:49.690
It looks like that.

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.230
It has a starting span
as the whole thing.

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:53.230
The starting time is here.

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:55.720
The ending time is here.

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.180
So for general codes, the
starting times and ending

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:01.500
times could be anywhere.

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.740
There will always
be k of them.

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:09.480
And otherwise, there's always
one at the beginning.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.860
If it's a nontrivial code,
there's always an ending time

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:12.970
at the end, et cetera.

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:19.380
But this particular behavior
is for self-dual codes.

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:24.340
Anyway, having done that
we can now read off the

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:28.840
dimensions of the state spaces
by simply looking for how many

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.980
generators are active at
any particular time.

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:35.670
For a state space, we're always
looking at the times

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:38.830
between the symbols,
cut times.

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.310
We could in fact draw a trivial
one there, but we're

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:42.850
looking between here.

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:44.560
How many are active
at this time?

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:45.840
One.

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.120
So dimension of the state
space at state

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:55.750
time k is 1, 2, 3.

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:59.040
This point, we come
back to 2 again.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:03.490
3, 2, 1, 0, 0 at the end.

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:05.750
It's always zero at the ends
because at that point

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:11.040
everything's in the future, or
everything is in the past.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.020
So these are trivial
state spaces.

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:18.150
These are the nontrivial state
spaces in the trellis.

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:21.980
And in fact, you remember
we had a little picture.

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:24.670
We can draw this complete
trellis out with the state

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:32.430
spaces of size 1 2
4 8 4 8 4 2 1.

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:37.060
So this is called the state
dimension profile, just this

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:39.640
set, this ordered set.

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:44.380
Or the state space size profile
is 2 to the dimension,

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:47.260
of binary codes, whatever.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.660
And similarly down here, if we
look at state space sizes, we

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:55.600
see the dimension is going
to be one at every time.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:59.860
So in this case, the dimension
of the state space is 0, 1, 1,

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:02.870
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0.

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:05.320
And similarly down here, we
look at the cut time.

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:08.250
It cuts one active generator
every time.

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:12.730
So it's 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0.

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:16.810
So we get at least the state
space dimensions just by

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:17.630
inspection of the

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:19.255
trellis-oriented generator matrix.

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:23.885
Question?

00:07:23.885 --> 00:07:25.135
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.200
PROFESSOR: We proved it
in several steps.

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:39.100
First we have the state space
theorem, which I gave to you

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:41.770
in the following form: the
dimension of the state space

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:47.530
at time k is equal to the
dimension of the code minus

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:49.940
the past subcode.

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:50.840
Let me write that.

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:55.580
The dimension of the past
subcode minus the dimension of

00:07:55.580 --> 00:08:01.500
the future subcode at time k
relative to this cut time.

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:04.960
And we proved from the
trellis-oriented generator

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:08.180
matrix that the past subcode
is generated by all the

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:11.660
trellis-oriented generators that
have support on the past,

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:13.120
and the future by all
the ones that have

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:15.040
support on the future.

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:18.220
So, it's simply we
take those out.

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:19.110
And what do we have left?

00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:23.540
We have the ones that are active
at time k, the ones

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:26.560
that are neither wholly
supported on the past nor on

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:26.990
the future.

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:29.870
They're supported both on
the past and future.

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:32.919
And those, that's what
this difference is.

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:39.590
So explicitly we have --

00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:43.724
the code is generated
by all generators.

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:49.210
That's all k generators.

00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:58.340
Cpk is generated by
trellis-oriented generators

00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:01.690
supported on the past.

00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:06.070
And Cfk is generated by the
trellis-oriented generators

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:07.320
supported on the future.

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:11.880
So the difference --

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:16.670
state code sk is generated
by the trellis-oriented

00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:21.500
generators not supported
on past or future, or

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:25.387
active at time k.

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:32.060
Probably good to write all
that out at least once.

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:32.772
Yeah?

00:09:32.772 --> 00:09:34.218
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:34.218 --> 00:09:38.317
self-dual codes all have such
properties that each time is

00:09:38.317 --> 00:09:39.270
starting and ending?

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:41.145
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:09:41.145 --> 00:09:42.390
AUDIENCE: Why is that?

00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:43.025
PROFESSOR: Why?

00:09:43.025 --> 00:09:46.820
It's a duality theorem, and
we're not doing many duality

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:49.870
theorems in this course, so
I'll simply tell you.

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:51.770
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:55.990
has this property, it
must be a self-dual.

00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:57.405
PROFESSOR: I don't think
that's true.

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:04.190
It's possible that's true.

00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:06.913
Duality theorems are very
strong, but I don't think this

00:10:06.913 --> 00:10:08.163
is a sufficient property.

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:14.145
For instance, suppose I just
changed one of the generators

00:10:14.145 --> 00:10:17.300
to look like that.

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:22.930
It still has disjoint starting
and ending times, but now I

00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:24.180
don't think the code
is self-dual.

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:30.100
So here's another code generated
by these four

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:33.740
generators, and I don't
believe self-dual.

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:36.440
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:38.370
PROFESSOR: I'm guessing
that it isn't.

00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:44.160
To prove it I would compute
the dual code, and I would

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.130
find that it wasn't same
code, didn't have

00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:47.380
the same code words.

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:53.180
But I'm guessing that if I just
make random changes in

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:55.860
the interior here, I'm not going
to get a self-dual code,

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:59.650
because that's a very strong
structural property.

00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:03.600
But I'm not going to take the
time in class to do that.

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:06.650
But these are good questions.

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:11.410
The whole subject of duality
is a wonderful and elegant

00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:13.210
topic that we just don't
have time to do

00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:14.230
much in this course.

00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:17.050
If I did it another time,
I could spend

00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:18.560
many lectures on duality.

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:21.960
Some of the homework problems
have suggested what you might

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:25.710
be able to do in orthogonal
codes, but --

00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:34.730
well, one of the problems you'll
do on the homework --

00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:36.210
I was going to talk about
it a little later.

00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:38.860
There's a dual state space
theorem that basically says

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:42.140
the state space sizes, or
dimensions, are the same for

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:46.530
the dual code as they are
for the primal code.

00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:48.500
Here's one example.

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:52.140
Of course, dual is itself, so
it's trivial that the state

00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:53.250
space size is the same.

00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:55.360
But here's another less
trivial example.

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:58.980
These two codes are orthogonal
to each other.

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:01.580
And what is similar about
their trellises?

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:05.010
Their trellises are both
two-state trellises.

00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:07.100
They don't look the same.

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:12.540
This trellis looks like this,
because they're all zeroes up

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:16.950
here, and all ones down here.

00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:20.470
That's the repetition code
trellis, whereas this trellis

00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:22.550
looks like this.

00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:30.300
It has crosses every time and
so forth, abstractly.

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:33.280
So trellises are not the same.

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:36.980
They have different branching
properties, but the state

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:39.410
space sizes are the
same at all times.

00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:43.560
This is a general property of
dual codes which you will

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:46.380
prove on the homework, if you
haven't done so already.

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:56.470
Sorry, it's hard to know what to
tell you about and what to

00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:59.140
suppress, because I'm also
trying to cover more

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:00.480
material this year.

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:02.840
There's a lot of material that's
really nice that I have

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:04.090
to skip over.

00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:10.040
Let's continue from this.

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:14.080
Let's make a minimal
realization.

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:19.770
So, a canonical minimal
trellis.

00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:23.380
I'm doing this in a little bit
different order than it's done

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:27.630
in the notes, but I think you
will see this kind of argument

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:28.880
very quickly.

00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:33.920
I've got this trellis-oriented
generator matrix, but suppose

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:36.025
I didn't know what the
trellis looked like.

00:13:36.025 --> 00:13:38.490
I put it up the first
time last time.

00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:41.370
But all I have is this generator
matrix, and I want

00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:44.690
to generate a trellis now for
this code which has minimal

00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:46.170
state spaces.

00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:48.610
It's also going to turn out to
be minimal in every other way.

00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:55.000
Well, let's start off
by realizing the

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.540
first generator here.

00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:02.330
The first generator generates a
little one-dimensional code.

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:09.770
G1, the code generated by the
first generator, is simply the

00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:15.380
two code words 0, 0, 0,
0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0.

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:22.140
So let me realize that little
one-dimensional code with a

00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:23.935
minimal trellis for that.

00:14:23.935 --> 00:14:27.124
What would it look like?

00:14:27.124 --> 00:14:30.470
If I go through this, I'll
see that it has --

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:34.590
my trellis-oriented generator
matrix for this code is simply

00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:38.080
1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0.

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:43.090
I see from that that the
dimensions of the state spaces

00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:46.970
is 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.

00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:56.740
And you can easily see that what
the trellis, the minimal

00:14:56.740 --> 00:15:04.840
trellis, a minimal trellis looks
like is 0, 0, 0, 0, 1,

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:14.160
1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0.

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:16.600
So there is the minimal trellis
realization for that

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:19.380
one-dimensional code.

00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:24.230
It has state spaces of
dimension 0, 1, 1,

00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:27.570
1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.

00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:30.770
Therefore the state spaces
are all minimal,

00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:32.965
as proved from this.

00:15:32.965 --> 00:15:34.510
It's all sort of elementary.

00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:49.230
Similarly, I can realize this
one by another little machine

00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:50.480
that looks like this.

00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:02.160
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:07.310
This is just the state
transition diagram of a linear

00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:10.790
time-varying finite
state machine.

00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:14.390
And it looks like that, and it
too is minimal by the same

00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:17.500
argument for the one-dimensional
code generated

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:19.860
by this generator.

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:23.750
What is this saying here?

00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:26.480
This is saying we really --

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:28.660
what we should imagine here
is we have a little memory

00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:36.100
element that's only active at
state times 1, 2, and 3.

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:40.020
So to realize this, this is a

00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:43.140
one-dimensional memory element.

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:46.001
Think of it as a little --

00:16:46.001 --> 00:16:49.600
well, a memory for
an element of f2.

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:55.110
It's active during the interval
1 through 3, during

00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:57.070
the time that this generator
is active.

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:03.270
It's active at these three
times, not otherwise.

00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:05.150
So you can think of it
as just disappearing.

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:08.130
It comes into existence
at time 1.

00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:11.839
It holds whatever the
input bit is.

00:17:11.839 --> 00:17:13.040
Think of --

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:18.270
we're trying to create the
code as the set of all --

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:21.109
sum of ui gi.

00:17:21.109 --> 00:17:23.310
And so what this memory element
really does is it

00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:27.780
holds ui during the time that
it's needed, which is at times

00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:30.450
1, 2, and 3.

00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:32.240
Whatever the coefficient is --

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:34.090
what could it be, 0 or 1?

00:17:34.090 --> 00:17:36.280
Element of the base field, f2.

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:46.120
So the memory element holds, it
contains u1 in this case.

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:47.322
Yeah?

00:17:47.322 --> 00:17:50.610
AUDIENCE: What if we look at
this matrix only for the

00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:51.960
second code.

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:52.944
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:17:52.944 --> 00:17:58.060
AUDIENCE: So that will give
0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0.

00:17:58.060 --> 00:17:59.190
PROFESSOR: Correct.

00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:01.970
AUDIENCE: So some places it
will suggest that the

00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:04.670
dimension is --

00:18:04.670 --> 00:18:09.900
PROFESSOR: The fact that
the values are --

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:12.570
there will always be 1 here at
the starting time and the

00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:13.640
ending time.

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:16.570
Otherwise we wouldn't
draw a branch there.

00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:20.150
But they can be arbitrary
in between.

00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:23.960
So don't be thrown off by the
fact that there are some 0

00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:25.950
values in here.

00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:30.870
What we're doing here is we're
realizing u2 times g2, where

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:34.430
u2 can be either 0 or 1.

00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:38.390
And g2 can be arbitrary, except
that it has a starting

00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:40.250
time and an ending
time, so it's not

00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:41.740
arbitrary for this kind.

00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:46.908
AUDIENCE: What if we try
to find the state space

00:18:46.908 --> 00:18:48.158
[INAUDIBLE]

00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:54.940
PROFESSOR: For this, what I
need is a one-dimensional

00:18:54.940 --> 00:19:01.320
memory element containing u2
which is active during a

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:04.300
different interval,
2 through 6.

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:09.780
So think of these as like
little stars that

00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:12.000
wink on or wink off.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.310
This thing comes into
existence for three

00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:17.600
consecutive times, and
then it disappears.

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:20.600
This thing comes into existence
for five consecutive

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:23.400
times, and then it disappears.

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:25.370
Because those are the only
times when it's needed to

00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:26.620
contribute to the output.

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:36.060
So altogether, we can think of
there as sort of being four

00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:43.140
memory elements which contain
u1, u2, u3, and u4.

00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:52.270
And we form the outputs g1k
times this, sort of like in

00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:54.300
the convolutional code.

00:19:54.300 --> 00:20:01.900
g2k g3k and g4k.

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:06.610
The generators step along in
time, and we form the outputs.

00:20:06.610 --> 00:20:13.330
We sum this all together in a
summer, and this provides yk,

00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:20.690
the output, as we go from k
equals 1 through 8 as we go

00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:23.010
through the code word.

00:20:23.010 --> 00:20:26.020
But we only need this one
for -- it's only on from

00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:30.260
time 1, 2, and 3.

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:33.720
And this is on from
time 2 through 6.

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:37.180
And this is on from
time 3 through 5.

00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:40.770
And this is on from
time 4 through 7.

00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:44.820
Because we don't need
it any other time.

00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:48.330
So you can think of an input
coming in at time 1, at the

00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:52.070
starting time of the first
generator, being saved for as

00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:54.210
long as it's needed, then
it's discarded.

00:20:54.210 --> 00:20:57.005
And in fact we don't need that
memory element anymore.

00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:03.190
How many people are
getting this?

00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:04.690
Raise your hand if
you get this.

00:21:07.462 --> 00:21:08.712
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:11.540
PROFESSOR: It's a time --

00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:15.720
what I'm trying to do is draw
a time-varying machine.

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:18.810
So how do I do that?

00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:20.630
At time 1, it looks like this.

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:27.540
Time 1, it just has u1,
and we multiply it by

00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:29.890
g11, which is 1.

00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:31.850
And that gives me the
output at time 1.

00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:35.250
There's nothing else
that contributes.

00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:43.670
At time 2, we've got now another
input, u1 and u2.

00:21:43.670 --> 00:21:46.200
And we've got to sum the
contributions from both of

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:48.655
those, times their respective
coefficients.

00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:55.550
At time 3, we're up to
three of them, and

00:21:55.550 --> 00:21:56.550
we need all of them.

00:21:56.550 --> 00:21:59.310
We're going to form some linear
combination according

00:21:59.310 --> 00:22:01.626
to the generator matrix.

00:22:01.626 --> 00:22:02.876
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:08.130
PROFESSOR: It's time-varying,
yeah.

00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:09.410
So get used to it.

00:22:09.410 --> 00:22:13.820
For a block code it obviously
has to be time-varying.

00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:18.990
Obviously if we regard these as
impulse responses, this is

00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:21.205
the impulse response to u1.

00:22:21.205 --> 00:22:26.520
It only lasts in terms of symbol
times from time 0 1 2

00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:30.930
3, for four time units
of symbol time.

00:22:30.930 --> 00:22:34.790
This is the impulse
response to u2.

00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:38.670
u2 you can think of as an input
that comes in at time 2,

00:22:38.670 --> 00:22:43.270
and whose output rings
for five more times.

00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:46.300
So you need to save u2 for five
more times, and then it

00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:46.900
disappears.

00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:48.055
We don't need to save
it anymore.

00:22:48.055 --> 00:22:50.290
We can let it drop off
the end of the shift

00:22:50.290 --> 00:22:53.350
register, if you like.

00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:59.550
u3 comes in at time 3, and this
is its impulse response.

00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:05.200
And u4 comes in at time 5, and
this is its impulse response.

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:07.210
Does that help?

00:23:07.210 --> 00:23:08.910
How many people are not
getting it now?

00:23:13.372 --> 00:23:14.622
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:22.632
PROFESSOR: We don't need it
here, but we're going to need

00:23:22.632 --> 00:23:25.890
it again at time 4, so
we have to save it.

00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:32.490
What are you going to do
with it at time 3?

00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:34.295
You going to hide
it somewhere?

00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:40.210
So I still need to save it.

00:23:44.410 --> 00:23:48.650
This, again, is linear system
theory, except I guess you

00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:52.670
just don't get taught linear
system theory anymore.

00:23:52.670 --> 00:23:55.490
But this is what you have
to do if you --

00:23:55.490 --> 00:23:59.130
before, for convolutional codes,
we did linear systems

00:23:59.130 --> 00:24:02.470
theory for linear time-invariant
systems.

00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:04.310
They have to be over a finite
field, but who cares?

00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:06.330
We did general linear
system theory.

00:24:06.330 --> 00:24:09.470
This is general linear system
theory for realizing

00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:10.720
time-varying systems.

00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:16.910
In fact, one comment that might
be good to make at this

00:24:16.910 --> 00:24:19.470
point is that --

00:24:19.470 --> 00:24:21.460
now go back and remember
what we did with

00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:22.710
convolutional codes.

00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:31.280
We started out with a rate 1
over n convolutional code c,

00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:34.760
and we found some generator
for it.

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:39.520
Basically we can take any code
word in the code, and all of

00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:41.410
its shifts will generate
the code.

00:24:41.410 --> 00:24:45.030
Any non-zero code word, all of
its time shifts generate the

00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:46.280
convolutional code.

00:24:49.290 --> 00:24:55.870
So take any code word g of d in
a convolutional code, and g

00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:59.320
of d, dg of d, d squared
g of d and so forth

00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:00.570
generate the code.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:11.400
But then we converted it by
doing a little polynomial or

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:14.830
Laurent series algebra.

00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:20.270
We took a rational one and we
converted it to a canonical

00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:25.980
one, g prime of d.

00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:29.480
Which if you remember, this is
the polynomial code word of

00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:36.840
minimum degree in the code.

00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:39.000
We call that degree nu.

00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:44.030
What were we doing there?

00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:51.880
The shifts of g prime of d
form a trellis-oriented

00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:56.080
generator matrix for this
convolutional code.

00:25:56.080 --> 00:26:00.370
For instance, for our canonical
example, g prime of

00:26:00.370 --> 00:26:01.620
d looked like this.

00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:11.340
Polynomial notation, it's 1 plus
d squared 1 plus d plus d

00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:13.740
squared is the generator
matrix.

00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:22.380
Let me write that out as 1, 1
at time 0 or coefficient 0.

00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:28.950
0, 1, 1, 1, and then all
0's before that, and

00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:30.190
all 0's after that.

00:26:30.190 --> 00:26:32.720
Is somebody sleeping?

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:34.730
Wake him up please, before
I turn around.

00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:40.696
What?

00:26:40.696 --> 00:26:43.190
Oh, all right.

00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:46.360
I'm very glad to hear that.

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:52.270
So here is g prime of d
written out as bits.

00:26:52.270 --> 00:26:54.530
dg prime of d looks like what?

00:26:54.530 --> 00:26:57.470
It looks like the same thing
shifted over one.

00:27:00.890 --> 00:27:10.120
d squared g prime of d looks
like this and so forth.

00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:18.320
Is this trellis-oriented?

00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:22.680
In this case, each time interval
contains two symbols.

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:26.680
Here are our divisions
between symbols.

00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:29.150
We've got a rate 1/2 code, so
we chose to take them two

00:27:29.150 --> 00:27:30.400
symbols at a time.

00:27:34.050 --> 00:27:35.830
Where are the starting
and ending times?

00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:37.550
This one starts here,
ends here.

00:27:37.550 --> 00:27:39.210
This one starts here,
ends here.

00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:41.100
Starts here, ends here.

00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:43.710
So all the starting times and
ending times are different.

00:27:43.710 --> 00:27:44.440
Ergo, this is a

00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:47.350
trellis-oriented generator matrix.

00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:51.420
Modulo some hand-waving about
infinite sequences.

00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:53.990
Ergo, we ought to be able to use
the state space theorem to

00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:57.830
say what are the state
space sizes.

00:27:57.830 --> 00:28:01.020
Any time I have a cut here,
what are the spans?

00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:05.590
The spans are like there,
there, there, so forth.

00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:11.670
So the state space dimension at
each time is going to be 2,

00:28:11.670 --> 00:28:16.070
2, 2, 2, 2.

00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:18.355
And if we go through this
construction procedure, what

00:28:18.355 --> 00:28:20.470
are we going to get?

00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:25.230
We're going to get something
that at time 0, we need to

00:28:25.230 --> 00:28:29.830
have in memory, we need
to remember u minus

00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:32.260
1 and u minus 2.

00:28:35.050 --> 00:28:39.070
At time 1, just doing what I did
up here, we need to have

00:28:39.070 --> 00:28:43.270
in memory u minus 1 and u0.

00:28:43.270 --> 00:28:48.810
At time 2, we need to have
in memory u0 and u1.

00:28:48.810 --> 00:28:50.780
And we achieve that just
by implementing this

00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:52.450
with a shift register.

00:28:52.450 --> 00:28:56.020
In the time-invariant case it's
very easy, and you all

00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:57.540
understand it.

00:28:57.540 --> 00:29:03.890
So exactly the same theory goes
through for rate 1 over n

00:29:03.890 --> 00:29:05.830
convolutional codes.

00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:10.000
I will tell you briefly that to
treat rate k over n, it's

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.860
basically just the same thing,
except we need k generators

00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:15.590
starting at each time here.

00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:19.300
But in order to get a canonical
encoder, we just get

00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:22.790
a trellis-oriented generator
matrix again.

00:29:22.790 --> 00:29:26.300
And by the way, modulo this
hand-waving about infinite

00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:31.950
sequences, I've now proved what
I asserted, that this

00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:35.990
encoder is minimal among all
encoders for this code, that

00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:38.640
it has the minimum number
of memory elements.

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:42.300
Because from this argument,
the minimal state space

00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:46.560
dimension at each time is 2
once I've achieved this

00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:48.580
canonical trellis-oriented
generator matrix.

00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:57.190
By the way, this theory
is very general.

00:29:57.190 --> 00:30:00.610
It's really all you need to know
to do minimal realization

00:30:00.610 --> 00:30:05.610
theory of linear systems,
whether they're time-varying

00:30:05.610 --> 00:30:09.065
or time-invariant over any
field, or over groups.

00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:16.290
So that was a parenthetical
comment about convolutional

00:30:16.290 --> 00:30:18.360
codes just to tie it back
to what we did in

00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:19.610
the previous chapter.

00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:26.340
I haven't completed
what I wanted to

00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:29.320
say about block codes.

00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:31.126
How am I going to do this
without erasing something?

00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:39.140
Let's go back to block codes.

00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:40.775
And I guess I'll move over.

00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:50.675
The point that I was in the
process of making was that I

00:30:50.675 --> 00:30:56.060
can realize each one of these
generators individually by a

00:30:56.060 --> 00:31:02.100
little trellis diagram that's
one-dimensional during the

00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:06.870
time that the generator is
active, and zero-dimensional

00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:11.220
state space during the time
the generator is inactive.

00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:15.840
And think of this as just
one component here.

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:20.120
To generate a code word,
a particular code

00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:23.700
word is just the sum.

00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:26.140
All I need to do is sum the
outputs of all these

00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:28.400
generators independently.

00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:30.430
How many different possibilities
are there?

00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:33.380
There are 2 to the k possible
code words.

00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:35.050
Each one of these generates
one of two

00:31:35.050 --> 00:31:36.120
possible code words.

00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:40.040
If I take the set of all
possible sums of these four

00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:43.240
code words, I'm going to have
16 possible code words.

00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:46.660
So that very quickly was what
I was doing when I said,

00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:50.960
here's a little machine that
generates the first code, c1.

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:55.150
Here's a little machine that
generates the second code, c2.

00:31:55.150 --> 00:31:57.780
Only has two possible code words
according to the value

00:31:57.780 --> 00:31:59.400
of what's in storage.

00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:02.180
This generates the
third component.

00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:04.250
This generates the
fourth component.

00:32:04.250 --> 00:32:07.200
Sum it all together,
and you get --

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:11.300
sorry, I'm calling this y now. y
equals the sum of the ui gi.

00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:16.750
You see that?

00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:20.850
I hope I've beaten it into
the ground enough now.

00:32:20.850 --> 00:32:25.170
So it's a linear time-varying
machine.

00:32:25.170 --> 00:32:28.800
That is a realization of it,
if you've understood my

00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:30.590
description of it now.

00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:32.160
And now we can draw
the trellis of it.

00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:44.080
That what can happen at time
1, we can either have u1.

00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:49.060
Now I can label my states
here, at this time u1.

00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:51.160
u1 can be either 0 or 1.

00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:52.410
This is u1.

00:32:54.390 --> 00:33:02.810
At time 2, I have both u1
and u2 in my state.

00:33:02.810 --> 00:33:11.900
So this can either be 0, 0
or 0, 1, or 1, 0 or 1, 1.

00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:14.655
And obviously if I've already
determined u1 is 0 here, it's

00:33:14.655 --> 00:33:22.180
still going to be 0 at time 2.

00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:27.910
I label these with their
associated outputs.

00:33:27.910 --> 00:33:30.710
This is 1.

00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:33.160
This is also 1.

00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:35.660
This can turn it back to 0.

00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:36.760
And I just keep going.

00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:40.390
At the third time, I
have u1, u2, u3.

00:33:40.390 --> 00:33:44.060
I have eight states.

00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:46.020
At time 4, I come back.

00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:51.205
I only have u2, u3 at time
4, and so these merge.

00:33:54.430 --> 00:33:56.614
So I get something --

00:33:56.614 --> 00:33:58.940
this doesn't merge like
that, though.

00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:01.710
It merges down here.

00:34:01.710 --> 00:34:03.840
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1.

00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:06.680
This merges to 0, 1 when
I drop the first one.

00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:11.500
It's probably worth doing
this more carefully

00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:12.750
than I'm doing it.

00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:20.330
0, 1 can go to 0, 1,
0, or 0, 1, 1.

00:34:20.330 --> 00:34:22.899
0, 1, 0 can either go to --

00:34:30.150 --> 00:34:32.290
u2 equals 1.

00:34:32.290 --> 00:34:36.100
I guess these can't cross.

00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:36.420
u2 --

00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:37.670
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:39.639 --> 00:34:40.667
PROFESSOR: Excuse me?

00:34:40.667 --> 00:34:42.098
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:42.098 --> 00:34:43.529
u3 and u4.

00:34:46.510 --> 00:34:51.090
PROFESSOR: No, this
is state time.

00:34:51.090 --> 00:34:54.580
State time 1, 2, 3.

00:34:54.580 --> 00:34:57.030
u4 hasn't started yet.

00:34:57.030 --> 00:35:02.940
So I'm sorry, this
is 5 through 7.

00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:05.470
Is that right?

00:35:05.470 --> 00:35:09.080
It only lasts for
three intervals.

00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:10.330
So I only have u2, u3.

00:35:16.030 --> 00:35:21.660
u1, u2 has to be 0, 0, 1, so
this would then go to 0, 1.

00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:23.100
0, 1.

00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:24.350
These seem to cross.

00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:28.595
Yes, they do cross.

00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:39.180
So let's see if I can actually
complete it.

00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:43.000
This could go to 1,
0, 0, or 1, 0, 1.

00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:51.410
And then this one goes up
to either 0, 0 or 0, 1.

00:35:51.410 --> 00:35:56.990
This one can go to 1,
1, 0 or 1, 1, 1.

00:35:56.990 --> 00:35:58.640
And that can go like this.

00:36:01.290 --> 00:36:04.520
So there's the trellis
for the first half.

00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:10.960
It's topologically the same, but
looks a little different

00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:12.270
from what I put up before.

00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:16.390
I interchanged these two with
these two, and this

00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:19.510
one with this one.

00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:26.110
But you can recover the trellis
that I had before.

00:36:26.110 --> 00:36:29.320
In any case, I claim when I've
labeled this with what the

00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:31.910
appropriate output is
at each time, I've

00:36:31.910 --> 00:36:33.160
got my minimal trellis.

00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:45.420
And now we can make more
comments about

00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:47.910
how the trellis works.

00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:51.860
You see that whenever a
generator starts, we have

00:36:51.860 --> 00:36:55.610
what's called a divergence in
the trellis, a branching

00:36:55.610 --> 00:36:58.910
process, a branching out,
whereas whenever a generator

00:36:58.910 --> 00:37:03.690
ends, we have a convergence
in.

00:37:03.690 --> 00:37:08.180
So a starting time --

00:37:08.180 --> 00:37:13.230
if we have a generator starting,
then we get a branch

00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:16.626
that looks like this, like
here, and here, and here.

00:37:16.626 --> 00:37:19.660
When we have an ending time,
we have branches that look

00:37:19.660 --> 00:37:21.630
like this, like here.

00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:24.880
So this is a starting time,
starting time, starting time,

00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:26.130
and ending time.

00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:36.230
So this tells you when things
open and close in the trellis.

00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:39.820
Now again, as I've said for
these more general trellises,

00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:43.170
down here we can have starting
and ending at the same time.

00:37:43.170 --> 00:37:46.460
And in that case,
we get a cross.

00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:50.400
We get a starting and ending
at the same time, we get

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:51.650
something that looks
like this.

00:37:55.630 --> 00:38:01.600
And if we get neither starting
nor ending, empty, then

00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:02.510
nothing happens.

00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:03.980
We just get --

00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:06.700
the trellis segment looks like
that, like this one here.

00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:12.560
In this case we have a starting
time, an ending time

00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:13.680
in this trellis.

00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:14.970
Here we have nothing
happening.

00:38:14.970 --> 00:38:16.850
Here we have nothing
happening.

00:38:16.850 --> 00:38:19.850
So you just get an extension,
a parallel extension where

00:38:19.850 --> 00:38:21.850
nothing happens.

00:38:21.850 --> 00:38:27.210
So again, the starting and
ending times tell you what

00:38:27.210 --> 00:38:28.460
happens in the trellis.

00:38:43.410 --> 00:38:49.490
There's one other thing that you
can read from the trellis,

00:38:49.490 --> 00:38:51.595
which is the size of
branch spaces.

00:38:55.170 --> 00:38:59.250
And since as usual I'm running
a little later

00:38:59.250 --> 00:39:02.300
than I intend to --

00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:10.970
let me just state without proof
that there is a similar

00:39:10.970 --> 00:39:12.595
theorem for branch spaces.

00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:17.210
What is a branch?

00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:32.890
When we look in a trellis, a
branch is one of these things.

00:39:32.890 --> 00:39:35.520
That's a branch.

00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:38.940
What do we need to
define a branch?

00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:46.840
We have a initial state, the
code output at time k.

00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:52.290
We're calling that y time
k in the next state.

00:39:52.290 --> 00:39:54.570
So it's that triple.

00:39:54.570 --> 00:39:57.120
Again, this is linear
system theory.

00:39:57.120 --> 00:40:00.600
State, output, next state.

00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:02.995
Those are the three things
that define a branch.

00:40:05.730 --> 00:40:08.260
This branch is state 1 0.

00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:14.810
Output whatever it is, y k,
and next state 1 0 0.

00:40:14.810 --> 00:40:17.500
And that differentiates it
from this down here.

00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:24.120
If we define the branch
as this triple,

00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:26.610
then we can add triples.

00:40:26.610 --> 00:40:31.010
States form a vector space
over the ground field.

00:40:31.010 --> 00:40:34.500
These are simply symbols
over the ground field.

00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:38.190
These are vectors over
the ground field.

00:40:38.190 --> 00:40:40.360
So we can add them.

00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:51.850
And we find that it's closed,
and the set of all branches is

00:40:51.850 --> 00:40:53.100
a vector space.

00:40:56.710 --> 00:41:00.100
It's fairly easy to show.

00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:05.000
Look at the notes, but it's
basically because these are

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:08.690
all projected from code words
in the first place, and code

00:41:08.690 --> 00:41:12.750
words form a vector space, so
this is just a projection of

00:41:12.750 --> 00:41:16.910
the code words, a certain kind
of projection onto the state

00:41:16.910 --> 00:41:19.425
spaces and symbol spaces
and so forth.

00:41:19.425 --> 00:41:24.310
A projection of a vector space
is a vector space.

00:41:24.310 --> 00:41:25.560
Roughly the proof.

00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:34.425
And what is the dimension
of the branch space?

00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:39.710
Again, I'm just going to
give you the answer.

00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:40.430
Suppose we have a

00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:45.220
trellis-oriented generator matrix.

00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:48.380
Let's suppose we want to find
out the size of the branch

00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:51.450
space at this time.

00:41:51.450 --> 00:41:54.120
What doesn't enter into
the branch space?

00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:57.020
What doesn't make a difference
to the branches?

00:41:57.020 --> 00:42:01.630
All the pasts that arrive at the
same state at time k are

00:42:01.630 --> 00:42:03.450
equivalent.

00:42:03.450 --> 00:42:06.980
So this generator doesn't
enter in.

00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:11.800
All the futures that depart from
time k plus 1 don't enter

00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:14.760
in, so anything that's supported
by the future at

00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:20.420
time k plus 1 doesn't
enter in.

00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:24.120
And what's left is all of the
generators that are active at

00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:27.710
symbol time k.

00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:31.580
Notice the symbol times occur
between the state times.

00:42:31.580 --> 00:42:40.050
So certainly this
is an easy --

00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:45.120
this is one of those results
that's easier to understand

00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:50.610
than to prove, and I'll refer
you to the notes to prove.

00:42:50.610 --> 00:42:54.690
The dimension of the branch
space is simply the number of

00:42:54.690 --> 00:42:58.540
generators that are active
at symbol time k.

00:43:09.971 --> 00:43:14.030
Because branches are
synchronized with the symbol

00:43:14.030 --> 00:43:15.600
times, not with the
state times.

00:43:18.190 --> 00:43:20.450
So how does that come
out over here?

00:43:20.450 --> 00:43:24.140
There's the dimension of the
branch space is 1 here.

00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:26.000
It's 2 here.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:27.930
It's 3 here.

00:43:27.930 --> 00:43:29.810
It's 4 here.

00:43:29.810 --> 00:43:32.340
I'm sorry, it's 3 again here.

00:43:32.340 --> 00:43:34.180
This one hasn't started yet.

00:43:34.180 --> 00:43:37.390
It's 3 again here.

00:43:37.390 --> 00:43:45.010
It's 3 again here,
2 here, 1 here.

00:43:45.010 --> 00:43:50.910
That means that the size of the
branch space is 2, 4, 8,

00:43:50.910 --> 00:43:55.685
8, 8, 8, 4, 2.

00:43:55.685 --> 00:43:58.290
Is that right?

00:43:58.290 --> 00:43:59.530
There are two branches here.

00:43:59.530 --> 00:44:00.880
There are four branches here.

00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:02.240
There are eight branches here.

00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:04.230
There are still eight
branches here.

00:44:04.230 --> 00:44:05.930
And it's symmetric on
the other side.

00:44:05.930 --> 00:44:10.400
So it looks like we got the
right answer there, and in

00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:13.740
fact it's a general rule.

00:44:13.740 --> 00:44:14.510
So that's great.

00:44:14.510 --> 00:44:15.540
That's another property of

00:44:15.540 --> 00:44:17.270
trellis-oriented generator matrix.

00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:20.070
We can again, by inspection, get
the dimensions of all the

00:44:20.070 --> 00:44:22.480
branch space sizes.

00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:25.990
Are the branch sizes
important?

00:44:25.990 --> 00:44:28.490
Yes.

00:44:28.490 --> 00:44:31.520
In fact, they're more important
from a complexity

00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:34.920
point of view than the
state space sizes.

00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:38.020
95% of the literature has
to do with state spaces.

00:44:38.020 --> 00:44:41.480
State space is a little bit more
elegant mathematically.

00:44:44.010 --> 00:44:46.610
For instance, you don't have the
same kind of dual branch

00:44:46.610 --> 00:44:50.950
space theorem as you have a
dual state space theorem.

00:44:50.950 --> 00:44:54.110
But actually, when you're asking
what's going on in the

00:44:54.110 --> 00:44:55.880
Viterbi algorithm, what
does the Viterbi

00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:57.680
algorithm have to do?

00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:01.070
At a minimum, it has to do one
thing for each branch.

00:45:01.070 --> 00:45:04.490
It has to perform a metric
extension, a metric addition

00:45:04.490 --> 00:45:07.150
computation at least once
for each branch.

00:45:07.150 --> 00:45:11.980
So the Viterbi algorithm
complexity is better estimated

00:45:11.980 --> 00:45:15.910
by the size of the branch space
than the size of the

00:45:15.910 --> 00:45:18.860
state space.

00:45:18.860 --> 00:45:21.720
To progress at this point, a
Viterbi algorithm has to do at

00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:22.690
least eight things.

00:45:22.690 --> 00:45:25.415
To progress again, it has to
do at least eight things.

00:45:29.050 --> 00:45:33.570
So it's more relevant from the
point of view of complexity.

00:45:33.570 --> 00:45:37.440
Furthermore, you can play games
with state space size.

00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:40.920
And you've seen me play games
with state space size.

00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:43.385
For instance, if I draw this
as a two-section trellis --

00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:49.950
the first picture I put up was
only a four-state trellis, and

00:45:49.950 --> 00:45:51.200
it looked like this.

00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:55.630
I went immediately
to time 2, and I

00:45:55.630 --> 00:45:57.890
aggregated these two things.

00:45:57.890 --> 00:46:02.075
0, 0 and 1, 1 were up
here, and 0, 1 and

00:46:02.075 --> 00:46:03.890
1, 0 were down here.

00:46:03.890 --> 00:46:05.200
And then I had a nice --

00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:08.510
I just drew these four
states over here.

00:46:08.510 --> 00:46:12.080
And if I do it like that, then
I get a much nicer picture.

00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:13.330
It looks like this.

00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:22.485
It looks only like a
four-state trellis.

00:46:22.485 --> 00:46:24.730
Now, is this still a
legitimate trellis?

00:46:24.730 --> 00:46:28.270
Yeah, it's still a legitimate
trellis.

00:46:28.270 --> 00:46:31.240
If I do a Viterbi algorithm
decoding of this trellis, is

00:46:31.240 --> 00:46:33.420
it any different from this?

00:46:33.420 --> 00:46:35.330
Well, in detail it is a
little bit different.

00:46:35.330 --> 00:46:38.420
You do the additions and the
comparisons and the selection.

00:46:38.420 --> 00:46:42.625
So you only do selections
every this often.

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.730
And if you think about it,
it's really legitimate to

00:46:48.730 --> 00:46:49.970
think of this --

00:46:49.970 --> 00:46:53.480
if you think exactly how the
Viterbi algorithm works,

00:46:53.480 --> 00:46:54.290
really what's it doing?

00:46:54.290 --> 00:46:55.870
It's not making any
selection here.

00:46:55.870 --> 00:46:58.330
It's just adding an increment
there, and then adding another

00:46:58.330 --> 00:47:00.830
increment, and it's not
making any selection

00:47:00.830 --> 00:47:02.570
until it gets here.

00:47:02.570 --> 00:47:06.360
So it's perfectly legitimate to
think of this as basically

00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:07.980
being a four-state algorithm.

00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:11.470
It really isn't doing any
work at this stage.

00:47:11.470 --> 00:47:15.430
All the work occurs at this
stage if you think about the

00:47:15.430 --> 00:47:18.310
operation of the Viterbi
algorithm.

00:47:18.310 --> 00:47:21.520
So this is a quite legitimate
representation.

00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:22.450
And so what are we
going to say?

00:47:22.450 --> 00:47:25.970
Is the state complexity of this
code, is it four states

00:47:25.970 --> 00:47:28.140
or is it eight states?

00:47:28.140 --> 00:47:29.840
Well, to some degree it's just
a matter of definition.

00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:34.630
How do you choose
to define it?

00:47:34.630 --> 00:47:38.900
If you want something more
fundamental, it's better to go

00:47:38.900 --> 00:47:41.580
to branch complexity.

00:47:41.580 --> 00:47:43.590
What's the branch complexity
here for the

00:47:43.590 --> 00:47:45.385
fully displayed trellis?

00:47:45.385 --> 00:47:47.070
It's eight.

00:47:47.070 --> 00:47:50.230
By branch complexity, I
mean the maximum size

00:47:50.230 --> 00:47:52.530
of any branch space.

00:47:52.530 --> 00:47:56.580
What's the branch
complexity here?

00:47:56.580 --> 00:47:57.215
It's eight.

00:47:57.215 --> 00:47:59.010
We've still got eight.

00:47:59.010 --> 00:48:01.790
Ultimately we've got to compare
these eight things and

00:48:01.790 --> 00:48:06.280
reduce them to four, whether
we do it here or here.

00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:11.020
I gave you another trellis which
was only a two-section

00:48:11.020 --> 00:48:18.480
trellis, where I just showed
the four central states.

00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:21.120
And we actually have two
branches going there, two

00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:24.300
branches going there, two
branches going there, and two

00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:25.830
branches going there.

00:48:25.830 --> 00:48:28.630
What's the branch complexity
of that trellis?

00:48:28.630 --> 00:48:29.755
Still eight.

00:48:29.755 --> 00:48:32.670
There are eight ways to get
from the origin to here.

00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:41.110
If you go back to how we do this
theorem, if you believe

00:48:41.110 --> 00:48:47.860
this theorem, what happens now
if we say arbitrarily, OK,

00:48:47.860 --> 00:48:50.260
we're going to define the state
spaces as we do in a

00:48:50.260 --> 00:48:52.520
rate 1/2 convolutional code.

00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:54.610
We're just going to define
the state times to

00:48:54.610 --> 00:48:55.860
be every two times.

00:49:00.980 --> 00:49:05.070
Then the dimension of the state
spaces, just at those

00:49:05.070 --> 00:49:09.100
times we've defined,
is 0, 2, 2, 2, 0.

00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:10.370
They don't change.

00:49:10.370 --> 00:49:15.120
We just have fewer of
them by our choice.

00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:17.610
What happens to the dimensions
of the branch spaces?

00:49:17.610 --> 00:49:21.340
Again, if the theorem is
correct, we should just count

00:49:21.340 --> 00:49:24.830
the number of active generators
at each now of

00:49:24.830 --> 00:49:28.580
these four bi-symbol times.

00:49:28.580 --> 00:49:34.720
So it's 2, 3, 3, 2.

00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:35.450
Is that right?

00:49:35.450 --> 00:49:39.920
That is the branch complexity
of this trellis down here.

00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:45.070
It's 4 in the initial interval,
and 8 over here.

00:49:45.070 --> 00:49:47.380
So again it's correct.

00:49:47.380 --> 00:49:50.480
Suppose we go to that so-called
two-section trellis.

00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:55.140
We just say there's a first
half and a second half.

00:49:55.140 --> 00:49:59.380
Now the states is going to
be 0 2 0, and the branch

00:49:59.380 --> 00:50:02.160
complexity is going to be --

00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:05.300
there are three active
generators in the first half,

00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:07.210
and three active generators
in the second half.

00:50:11.300 --> 00:50:13.530
So by playing this kind of
game, which is called

00:50:13.530 --> 00:50:20.080
sectionalization, we can make
the state complexity sometimes

00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:20.880
appear simpler.

00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:23.480
There are limits to how much
simpler we can make it.

00:50:23.480 --> 00:50:24.470
Well, there actually aren't.

00:50:24.470 --> 00:50:29.970
Suppose we took the whole eight
symbols as one time.

00:50:29.970 --> 00:50:34.410
We'd have 0 dimensional state
space at the beginning, and 0

00:50:34.410 --> 00:50:35.320
dimensional at the end.

00:50:35.320 --> 00:50:37.170
What does that trellis
look like?

00:50:37.170 --> 00:50:40.670
It looks like 16 parallel
transitions from

00:50:40.670 --> 00:50:41.700
beginning to end.

00:50:41.700 --> 00:50:43.995
That's a legitimate
trellis, right?

00:50:43.995 --> 00:50:46.350
We should have one state at the
beginning and one state at

00:50:46.350 --> 00:50:49.180
the end, and 16 transitions.

00:50:49.180 --> 00:50:51.480
Is that what we get if
we went through this?

00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:52.790
Yeah.

00:50:52.790 --> 00:50:54.120
We have 0 0.

00:50:54.120 --> 00:50:55.590
And what's the branch
complexity?

00:50:55.590 --> 00:50:57.340
It's 4.

00:50:57.340 --> 00:50:59.610
The dimension of the branch
space is 4 if we took the

00:50:59.610 --> 00:51:02.380
whole thing.

00:51:02.380 --> 00:51:06.760
So we can mask state complexity
by picking our

00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:12.080
state spaces at appropriate
times, but you can't ever mask

00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:14.060
branch complexity.

00:51:14.060 --> 00:51:18.740
And again, it's a very
intuitive proof here.

00:51:18.740 --> 00:51:21.530
Let's take this time here, where
there are three active

00:51:21.530 --> 00:51:22.780
generators.

00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:27.765
By expanding that time, can we
ever get fewer than three

00:51:27.765 --> 00:51:29.145
active generators?

00:51:29.145 --> 00:51:34.660
No, any interval that includes
this particular time is going

00:51:34.660 --> 00:51:38.090
to have three active
generators in it.

00:51:38.090 --> 00:51:41.340
So branch complexity cannot
be reduced by this kind of

00:51:41.340 --> 00:51:42.560
sectionalization game.

00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:45.200
State complexity can be
apparently reduced.

00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:47.020
It isn't really.

00:51:47.020 --> 00:51:48.680
But branch complexity cannot.

00:51:48.680 --> 00:51:49.930
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:52.730 --> 00:51:54.440
PROFESSOR: And if you go too
far, it might increase.

00:51:57.800 --> 00:52:02.170
So at the very end of the
chapter, I talk about

00:52:02.170 --> 00:52:05.110
sectionalization.

00:52:05.110 --> 00:52:07.580
It's not a very important
issue.

00:52:07.580 --> 00:52:11.860
There's a very easy heuristic
for how you should

00:52:11.860 --> 00:52:14.720
sectionalize, which is basically
you should make the

00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:17.970
sections as big as you can
without increasing branch

00:52:17.970 --> 00:52:19.790
complexity.

00:52:19.790 --> 00:52:23.720
So in this case, the heuristic
says we know we're going to

00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:27.330
have to have branch
complexity of 3.

00:52:27.330 --> 00:52:28.620
But without increasing --

00:52:28.620 --> 00:52:32.660
if I just make this one
partition at the center, I

00:52:32.660 --> 00:52:36.360
just take these two sections,
first half, second half.

00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:39.980
Then I have an increased
branch complexity.

00:52:39.980 --> 00:52:42.110
So that's a good
sectionalization.

00:52:42.110 --> 00:52:44.930
This will probably lead to the
simplest Viterbi algorithm and

00:52:44.930 --> 00:52:48.480
the simplest-looking trellis
representation of the code.

00:52:52.290 --> 00:52:55.380
So that's the character of the
sectionalization algorithm.

00:52:55.380 --> 00:52:56.700
You can read about it.

00:52:56.700 --> 00:53:02.030
It usually winds up with
a sensible time-varying

00:53:02.030 --> 00:53:05.980
sectionalization, and it's
worth five minutes of

00:53:05.980 --> 00:53:06.490
discussion.

00:53:06.490 --> 00:53:06.860
Yes.

00:53:06.860 --> 00:53:09.691
AUDIENCE: Is it like a monotonic
kind of thing, like

00:53:09.691 --> 00:53:13.400
if you make sections bigger,
then you'll only either

00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:15.860
increase or keep the same
branch complexity?

00:53:15.860 --> 00:53:18.380
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that was my
basic argument, that if I have

00:53:18.380 --> 00:53:21.560
any section that includes this
time, and I start making it

00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:25.240
bigger, the dimension
can only increase.

00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:28.960
So the algorithm is to keep
increasing it until I get to

00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:33.050
some place where I might have to
include another generator.

00:53:33.050 --> 00:53:36.000
For instance here, if I'm taking
this time, I don't want

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:37.800
to push it out over here,
because then I'll get the

00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:39.710
fourth generator in there.

00:53:39.710 --> 00:53:47.850
So any section that includes
time 3 should not be extended

00:53:47.850 --> 00:53:50.470
in this direction, because we'll
get another generator.

00:53:50.470 --> 00:53:54.150
But no problem with extending
in this direction.

00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:58.260
So that's the basic heuristic.

00:53:58.260 --> 00:54:00.070
It's easy.

00:54:00.070 --> 00:54:03.130
And it's not very productive.

00:54:03.130 --> 00:54:06.120
It doesn't really change the
complexity of the Viterbi

00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:08.610
algorithm as a representation
of code.

00:54:08.610 --> 00:54:10.870
So these are just a couple
of arguments to say

00:54:10.870 --> 00:54:12.650
really we might --

00:54:12.650 --> 00:54:14.720
the branch complexity
is more fundamental.

00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:17.600
We want to focus on branch
complexity a little bit more.

00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:28.750
But of course, if you have a
fully displayed trellis, the

00:54:28.750 --> 00:54:32.230
maximum state space dimension is
either going to be equal to

00:54:32.230 --> 00:54:35.760
the maximum branch space
dimension or one less than it.

00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:40.380
Because in these binary
trellises, we get at most a

00:54:40.380 --> 00:54:42.570
binary branch at each time.

00:54:42.570 --> 00:54:47.030
So any branch complexity is
at most twice that of the

00:54:47.030 --> 00:54:50.630
adjacent state space.

00:54:50.630 --> 00:54:53.640
So they're not going to
differ by very much.

00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:58.440
So state complexity is a good
proxy for branch complexity in

00:54:58.440 --> 00:55:02.040
a fully displayed or
unsectionalized trellis.

00:55:10.070 --> 00:55:13.420
While I'm on this subject,
there's another interesting

00:55:13.420 --> 00:55:23.555
direction we can go, which is
average dimension bounds.

00:55:34.080 --> 00:55:37.910
Again, think of our
realization here.

00:55:43.850 --> 00:55:45.230
What does it contribute?

00:55:45.230 --> 00:55:51.520
What does a single generator
contribute overall to state

00:55:51.520 --> 00:55:55.430
and branch space complexity?

00:55:55.430 --> 00:56:06.390
A single generator Gj of span
S, which of course has to be

00:56:06.390 --> 00:56:08.235
greater than or equal to
the minimum distance

00:56:08.235 --> 00:56:09.370
to the code, right?

00:56:09.370 --> 00:56:11.335
The span can't be less
of a generator.

00:56:11.335 --> 00:56:14.110
It can't be less than
the minimum nonzero

00:56:14.110 --> 00:56:17.180
weight of any code word.

00:56:17.180 --> 00:56:25.600
Span S contributes overall
to all the state space

00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:26.320
dimensions.

00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:33.480
It contributes S minus 1 state
space dimensions, because it's

00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:38.470
active for S minus
1 state times.

00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:47.200
And it contributes S branch
dimensions because it's active

00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:51.545
for S symbols.

00:56:54.240 --> 00:56:58.530
If I look at it spread out
across time, this generator of

00:56:58.530 --> 00:57:05.100
span 4, it contributed three
times to a state space

00:57:05.100 --> 00:57:06.800
dimension, and it
contributed four

00:57:06.800 --> 00:57:09.415
times to a branch dimension.

00:57:13.510 --> 00:57:25.490
So total state dimension has to
be greater than or equal to

00:57:25.490 --> 00:57:28.360
k times d minus 1.

00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:32.300
And the total branch dimension,
just summing up

00:57:32.300 --> 00:57:36.110
across the trellis, is greater
than or equal to k

00:57:36.110 --> 00:57:37.650
generators times d.

00:57:41.960 --> 00:57:43.750
Now how many different
nontrivial

00:57:43.750 --> 00:57:47.000
state spaces are there?

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:50.300
There are n minus 1 nontrivial
state times.

00:57:50.300 --> 00:57:52.420
Excuse me.

00:57:52.420 --> 00:57:55.730
For instance, in this code
of length 8, there are 7

00:57:55.730 --> 00:57:57.855
nontrivial state spaces.

00:58:00.830 --> 00:58:08.530
So the average state dimension
has to be greater than or

00:58:08.530 --> 00:58:18.440
equal to k d minus
1 over n minus 1.

00:58:18.440 --> 00:58:25.230
And the average branch dimension
has got to be

00:58:25.230 --> 00:58:28.820
greater than or equal to k d
over the n symbol times.

00:58:35.260 --> 00:58:40.350
So actually we might remember
that quantity.

00:58:40.350 --> 00:58:42.700
That's what we called the coding
gain of the code, the

00:58:42.700 --> 00:58:44.280
nominal coding gain on
the additive white

00:58:44.280 --> 00:58:46.700
Gaussian noise channel.

00:58:46.700 --> 00:58:50.030
Well, if the average dimension
is lower bounded by something,

00:58:50.030 --> 00:58:53.290
then certainly the maximum state
space dimension is lower

00:58:53.290 --> 00:58:54.540
bounded by that.

00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:05.270
Max has to be at least as
great as the average.

00:59:09.510 --> 00:59:12.580
So if these are what are called
the average dimension

00:59:12.580 --> 00:59:20.050
bounds on the maximum state
space size, and there are some

00:59:20.050 --> 00:59:23.700
interesting implications.

00:59:23.700 --> 00:59:26.480
Again, this expression for
branch dimension is nicer

00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:28.440
here, because it's
this k d over n

00:59:28.440 --> 00:59:30.090
nominal coding gain thing.

00:59:30.090 --> 00:59:34.606
It's in terms of the basic n
k d parameters of the code.

00:59:34.606 --> 00:59:36.390
And it says what?

00:59:36.390 --> 00:59:44.020
It says if you want a nominal
coding gain of 2, it implies

00:59:44.020 --> 00:59:52.560
that the max branch dimension is
greater than or equal to 2.

00:59:52.560 --> 00:59:58.040
Or the max size is greater than
or equal to 2 to the 2,

00:59:58.040 --> 01:00:02.160
or you need a branch space of at
least size 4, or dimension

01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:09.540
2 to get a 3 dB nominal
coding gain.

01:00:09.540 --> 01:00:12.245
Similarly, if you want
a 6 dB gain --

01:00:15.850 --> 01:00:18.382
let's get right down to dB.

01:00:18.382 --> 01:00:22.626
It says you're going to need a
branch space size greater than

01:00:22.626 --> 01:00:28.320
or equal to 4, or at least
a 16-state trellis.

01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:30.670
So we know if we want a 6 dB
coding gain, we're going to

01:00:30.670 --> 01:00:33.730
need at least a 16-state
trellis,

01:00:33.730 --> 01:00:35.170
or a 16-branch trellis.

01:00:35.170 --> 01:00:37.710
It might be an eight-state
trellis.

01:00:37.710 --> 01:00:41.840
Well, these are not tight, but
they're quite indicative in

01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:47.510
fact of what we see in both the
tables for block codes and

01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:50.685
for convolutional codes.

01:00:50.685 --> 01:00:53.300
These same bounds hold for
convolutional codes, by the

01:00:53.300 --> 01:00:55.970
way, just average over
infinite time.

01:00:58.540 --> 01:01:01.870
But they're still
perfectly good.

01:01:01.870 --> 01:01:06.020
So they tell us that
in order to get --

01:01:06.020 --> 01:01:10.150
if we want the nominal coding
gain to keep going up to 8, to

01:01:10.150 --> 01:01:16.290
16, to infinity, it says we're
going to need infinite trellis

01:01:16.290 --> 01:01:18.390
complexity to get infinite
coding gain.

01:01:23.740 --> 01:01:27.640
Let's do some little
asymptotics, be a little bit

01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:30.120
more refined about this.

01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:54.020
A sequence of codes Cn of length
n going to infinity is

01:01:54.020 --> 01:02:03.110
called good if both the rate k
over n is bounded away from 0

01:02:03.110 --> 01:02:09.540
as n goes to infinity, and the
distance d over n is bounded

01:02:09.540 --> 01:02:11.690
away from 0.

01:02:11.690 --> 01:02:15.980
The rate and the relative
distance are both bounded away

01:02:15.980 --> 01:02:18.810
from 0 as n goes to infinity.

01:02:18.810 --> 01:02:19.450
Is that clear?

01:02:19.450 --> 01:02:23.510
In other words, we want the
dimension and the minimum

01:02:23.510 --> 01:02:27.830
distance both to increase
linearly with n in a good

01:02:27.830 --> 01:02:28.830
sequence of codes.

01:02:28.830 --> 01:02:32.420
This is a classical algebraic
definition, and it's easy to

01:02:32.420 --> 01:02:36.660
prove there exists good
sequences of codes.

01:02:36.660 --> 01:02:40.350
You just pick a code at random,
rate 1/2 of binary

01:02:40.350 --> 01:02:42.110
linear code.

01:02:42.110 --> 01:02:46.320
It on average will have
a relative minimum

01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:48.750
distance about 11%.

01:02:48.750 --> 01:02:50.860
This is just basic information
theory.

01:02:53.650 --> 01:02:57.850
So there certainly exists
sequences of good codes, and

01:02:57.850 --> 01:03:02.130
this is what most of coding
theory was occupied with

01:03:02.130 --> 01:03:05.380
constructing for a
very long time.

01:03:05.380 --> 01:03:07.790
What happens if you have a
good sequence of codes?

01:03:10.990 --> 01:03:17.200
We have this nominal coding
gain, which is equal to kd

01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:24.975
over n, which is equal to n
times k over n times d over n.

01:03:24.975 --> 01:03:29.210
If both of these are bounded
away from zero, then the

01:03:29.210 --> 01:03:43.240
nominal coding gain has to
increase linearly with n.

01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:47.460
That means that the average,
or the maximum branch

01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:51.420
dimension, in a minimal trellis
representation for

01:03:51.420 --> 01:03:55.100
your code has to increase at
least linearly with n, which

01:03:55.100 --> 01:04:00.820
means that the actual branch
complexity, the size of B, has

01:04:00.820 --> 01:04:08.150
to increase as --

01:04:08.150 --> 01:04:12.480
it goes as 2 to the nominal
coding gain, which is in other

01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:14.350
words exponentially with n.

01:04:23.350 --> 01:04:28.570
So basically what this says is
that if your objective is to

01:04:28.570 --> 01:04:31.770
get a good sequence of codes,
if this is the way you think

01:04:31.770 --> 01:04:37.780
you're going to get to channel
capacity, then sure enough,

01:04:37.780 --> 01:04:41.050
your nominal coding gain
will go up to infinity

01:04:41.050 --> 01:04:43.010
linearly with n.

01:04:43.010 --> 01:04:45.170
But how are you going
to decode it?

01:04:45.170 --> 01:04:48.370
Our first method was simply
maximum likelihood decoding.

01:04:48.370 --> 01:04:51.680
The complexity of that,
computing the distance to

01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:54.550
every code word, that
certainly goes up

01:04:54.550 --> 01:04:58.180
exponentially with n, exhaustive
decoding, comparing

01:04:58.180 --> 01:04:59.570
with every code word.

01:04:59.570 --> 01:05:02.930
But now we have a new method
which is, we hope, simpler,

01:05:02.930 --> 01:05:04.990
which is trellis decoding.

01:05:04.990 --> 01:05:08.470
But we find out, unfortunately,
the complexity

01:05:08.470 --> 01:05:10.110
of trellis decoding
is going to go up

01:05:10.110 --> 01:05:13.170
exponentially with n as well.

01:05:13.170 --> 01:05:20.890
So the good news was that with
the Viterbi algorithm and a

01:05:20.890 --> 01:05:25.390
minimal trellis, we can get
a simpler optimum maximum

01:05:25.390 --> 01:05:28.160
likelihood decoding algorithm
for block code, simpler than

01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:30.070
exhaustive decoding.

01:05:30.070 --> 01:05:34.420
The bad news is that under
this assumption, the

01:05:34.420 --> 01:05:36.800
complexity of that algorithm
is still going to go up

01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:38.140
exponentially with n.

01:05:38.140 --> 01:05:41.070
Maybe just a lower exponent,
that's all.

01:05:41.070 --> 01:05:44.790
So we haven't really solved our
basic problem, which is

01:05:44.790 --> 01:05:48.300
exponential decoding complexity,
by going to

01:05:48.300 --> 01:05:49.550
trellis decoding.

01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:59.376
We have, however, another
way to go.

01:05:59.376 --> 01:06:03.820
Do we really need the coding
gain to go to infinity, the

01:06:03.820 --> 01:06:07.170
nominal coding gain
to go to infinity?

01:06:07.170 --> 01:06:10.760
If we go back and remember the
name of the game, the playing

01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:12.820
field that we're on, at least in
the additive white Gaussian

01:06:12.820 --> 01:06:17.970
noise channel, we found the
distance between uncoded and

01:06:17.970 --> 01:06:23.010
the Shannon limit was some
finite number, something like

01:06:23.010 --> 01:06:26.340
9 dB at a 10 to the minus 5
error probability, larger at

01:06:26.340 --> 01:06:27.460
lower error probability.

01:06:27.460 --> 01:06:30.990
So that's the maximum
effective coding

01:06:30.990 --> 01:06:34.440
gain we can ever get.

01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:39.160
So maybe we only need a finite
nominal coding gain.

01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:41.860
In practice, this means maybe
we don't need a minimum

01:06:41.860 --> 01:06:44.580
distance that goes up
linearly with n.

01:06:44.580 --> 01:06:48.390
Maybe we can have a very
long code with

01:06:48.390 --> 01:06:51.220
a low minimum distance.

01:06:51.220 --> 01:06:53.310
And that would be another
way to crack

01:06:53.310 --> 01:06:55.660
the complexity problem.

01:06:55.660 --> 01:06:58.070
In fact, some of the
capacity-approaching codes

01:06:58.070 --> 01:07:00.220
that we're going to talk about,
specifically turbo

01:07:00.220 --> 01:07:03.030
codes, tend to have bad
minimum distances.

01:07:03.030 --> 01:07:06.260
You have a turbo code that's
thousands of bits long, and

01:07:06.260 --> 01:07:09.190
its minimum distance will be
something like 20 or 30.

01:07:12.330 --> 01:07:17.790
And yet it signals within 1
dB of the Shannon limit.

01:07:17.790 --> 01:07:20.935
It gives you low error
probabilities within 1 dB of

01:07:20.935 --> 01:07:21.920
the Shannon limit.

01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:27.490
So maybe there's another way to
go, at least if we're only

01:07:27.490 --> 01:07:31.360
interested in a certain
error probability.

01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:32.900
Maybe it's 10 to the minus 5.

01:07:32.900 --> 01:07:34.340
Maybe it's 10 to the minus 10.

01:07:34.340 --> 01:07:37.350
But it's still only a finite
error probability.

01:07:37.350 --> 01:07:38.390
Maybe we don't need the minimum

01:07:38.390 --> 01:07:40.900
distance to go to infinity.

01:07:40.900 --> 01:07:47.410
Maybe we can get by sampling
codes which are lousy in

01:07:47.410 --> 01:07:51.290
classical terms, which have
poor minimum distance.

01:07:51.290 --> 01:07:55.860
Maybe they'd be lousy in
distance terms, or in nominal

01:07:55.860 --> 01:07:59.980
coding gain terms, but they'll
be very good from the point of

01:07:59.980 --> 01:08:00.840
view of complexity.

01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:02.910
Maybe there's some
trade-off here.

01:08:02.910 --> 01:08:05.335
We know the code is going to
have to be long, but maybe it

01:08:05.335 --> 01:08:06.990
doesn't have to have
large distance.

01:08:06.990 --> 01:08:07.954
Yeah.

01:08:07.954 --> 01:08:09.204
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:08:11.810 --> 01:08:13.750
That's what you are
saying, isn't it?

01:08:13.750 --> 01:08:14.980
We try to maintain the --

01:08:14.980 --> 01:08:17.290
PROFESSOR: We certainly want
to maintain a finite rate.

01:08:20.189 --> 01:08:22.960
This was the problem with
orthogonal and simplex codes

01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:25.990
and so forth, is that the rate
went to zero, and therefore

01:08:25.990 --> 01:08:28.330
the spectral efficiency
went to zero.

01:08:28.330 --> 01:08:31.850
In practically all cases,
that's unacceptable.

01:08:31.850 --> 01:08:37.689
So we need to maintain some
minimal rate or spectral

01:08:37.689 --> 01:08:40.859
efficiency on the additive
white Gaussian noise.

01:08:40.859 --> 01:08:44.246
So that we need, but this
maybe we don't need.

01:08:51.350 --> 01:08:57.240
So that's just a interesting
little bit of philosophy we

01:08:57.240 --> 01:09:00.810
can do at this point, is how
should you really design

01:09:00.810 --> 01:09:02.390
capacity-achieving codes?

01:09:02.390 --> 01:09:07.630
And this seems to be a clue to
the way to go that has in fact

01:09:07.630 --> 01:09:10.580
proved to be good.

01:09:10.580 --> 01:09:15.000
However, I should add that not
all capacity-approaching codes

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.770
have this property.

01:09:17.770 --> 01:09:20.479
A random low-density parity
check code is going to have

01:09:20.479 --> 01:09:25.580
both low complexity and a very
good minimum distance as well.

01:09:25.580 --> 01:09:30.710
So this certainly isn't
the full story.

01:09:36.490 --> 01:09:43.939
There are just two more topics
in chapter 10, and maybe I'll

01:09:43.939 --> 01:09:46.124
discuss them both briefly
right now.

01:09:49.029 --> 01:09:51.943
One is I skipped over
projections.

01:09:57.360 --> 01:10:00.730
And how shall I introduce
this subject?

01:10:00.730 --> 01:10:06.590
I talked about the subcode of,
say, this code, which is

01:10:06.590 --> 01:10:11.860
pretty badly marked-up by now,
but let me keep using it.

01:10:11.860 --> 01:10:15.190
I talked about the subcode
that's supported, say, on the

01:10:15.190 --> 01:10:17.270
first half.

01:10:17.270 --> 01:10:20.830
In this case it's simply the
subcode that's generated by

01:10:20.830 --> 01:10:22.080
the first generator.

01:10:25.100 --> 01:10:30.000
Here's another code that we can
look at that's kind of a

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:31.740
first half code.

01:10:31.740 --> 01:10:37.570
Suppose we just take the set
of all possible first

01:10:37.570 --> 01:10:40.100
four-tuples in this code.

01:10:40.100 --> 01:10:43.680
That's called the projection
onto the first half.

01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:46.310
In other words, what are
the set of all possible

01:10:46.310 --> 01:10:47.900
four-tuples?

01:10:47.900 --> 01:10:57.260
They're the set of code words
that are generated by 1, 1, 1,

01:10:57.260 --> 01:11:02.260
1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0,
1, 1, and this

01:11:02.260 --> 01:11:04.050
doesn't contribute anything.

01:11:04.050 --> 01:11:07.870
So it's a linear code.

01:11:07.870 --> 01:11:10.220
It's length 4.

01:11:10.220 --> 01:11:13.550
It has three generators,
dimension 3.

01:11:13.550 --> 01:11:17.560
And we can quickly convince
ourselves that it's the even

01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:20.220
weight, or zero sum, or
a single parity check

01:11:20.220 --> 01:11:23.070
code of length 4.

01:11:23.070 --> 01:11:26.520
So if we project this on
to the first half, we

01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:30.390
get a 4, 3, 2 code.

01:11:30.390 --> 01:11:33.900
So that's what I mean
by a projection.

01:11:33.900 --> 01:11:38.850
If I project on to here,
I get the 1 0 code.

01:11:38.850 --> 01:11:41.660
I'm sorry, I get the universe
code of length 1, all

01:11:41.660 --> 01:11:42.820
one-tuples.

01:11:42.820 --> 01:11:44.630
On here I get all two-tuples.

01:11:44.630 --> 01:11:46.800
On here I get all
three-tuples.

01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:48.740
But on here I don't get
all four-tuples.

01:11:48.740 --> 01:11:51.820
I get a single parity
check code.

01:11:51.820 --> 01:11:53.315
So those are my projections.

01:11:56.120 --> 01:11:59.260
Some things can be done nicely
in terms of projections.

01:11:59.260 --> 01:12:02.550
Projections are kind of
the dual to subcodes.

01:12:02.550 --> 01:12:06.090
In fact, you prove this on the
homework in the course of

01:12:06.090 --> 01:12:08.990
proving the dual state
space theorem.

01:12:08.990 --> 01:12:18.720
In other words, the dual of a
subcode of a code C is the

01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:24.840
projection of the dual code
of C, and vice versa.

01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:29.450
They're always tongue twisters,
the duality theorem.

01:12:29.450 --> 01:12:31.380
But that's what you will
prove along the way.

01:12:31.380 --> 01:12:36.660
Let me give you the relevance
of this to

01:12:36.660 --> 01:12:37.910
the state space theorem.

01:12:40.950 --> 01:12:43.540
So I had the state space
theorem right here.

01:12:43.540 --> 01:12:45.499
So let me leave it up.

01:12:52.350 --> 01:12:56.720
State space theorem
is based on --

01:12:56.720 --> 01:13:05.890
in general, we divide the
generator matrix g prime into

01:13:05.890 --> 01:13:12.890
a part that is a generator
for the past subcode 0.

01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:21.190
0 generator for the
future subcode.

01:13:21.190 --> 01:13:26.180
And then some stuff down here,
which is generators of the

01:13:26.180 --> 01:13:27.430
state space code.

01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:41.350
By construction here, the
projections of any nonzero

01:13:41.350 --> 01:13:46.640
vector in the state space
code are nonzero.

01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:52.370
If they were zero, any nonzero
linear combination of these

01:13:52.370 --> 01:13:55.980
generators down here cannot
be zero on here.

01:14:00.850 --> 01:14:06.450
So the projection on to the
first half here, the dimension

01:14:06.450 --> 01:14:08.460
of the projection --

01:14:08.460 --> 01:14:11.960
I'm making a slight skip here
-- is basically equal to the

01:14:11.960 --> 01:14:16.320
dimension of the past subspace
code plus the dimension of the

01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:17.990
state code.

01:14:17.990 --> 01:14:20.620
It's basically generated by
these generators and these

01:14:20.620 --> 01:14:22.810
generators projected
onto here.

01:14:22.810 --> 01:14:26.190
We can forget about
these generators.

01:14:26.190 --> 01:14:29.040
So let me write that down.

01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:36.930
The dimension of C projected
onto the past is equal to the

01:14:36.930 --> 01:14:42.300
dimension of the past subcode
plus the dimension of the

01:14:42.300 --> 01:14:43.550
state space code.

01:14:48.450 --> 01:14:54.790
Which leads to another version
of the state space theorem.

01:14:54.790 --> 01:14:58.392
I could simply write state space
theorem as dimension of

01:14:58.392 --> 01:15:02.090
the state space at time k is
simply the difference between

01:15:02.090 --> 01:15:06.770
the dimension of the projection,
C projected on the

01:15:06.770 --> 01:15:09.640
past, minus the dimension
of the subcode.

01:15:12.210 --> 01:15:15.100
It's all of these guys
minus these guys.

01:15:17.730 --> 01:15:22.260
And again, if we look back here,
we see we have the 4, 3

01:15:22.260 --> 01:15:30.080
code is C projected on
p, 4, 3, 2, and C --

01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:32.870
the subcode is 4, 1, 4.

01:15:32.870 --> 01:15:37.090
In fact, for this, these are
both Reed-Muller codes of half

01:15:37.090 --> 01:15:38.100
the length.

01:15:38.100 --> 01:15:39.855
This is not an accident,
as you will

01:15:39.855 --> 01:15:42.420
prove in the homework.

01:15:42.420 --> 01:15:45.340
The state space size is the
difference in the dimensions

01:15:45.340 --> 01:15:46.290
of these two codes.

01:15:46.290 --> 01:15:49.420
This is a very handy thing
to know, and you're

01:15:49.420 --> 01:15:51.690
going to need this.

01:15:51.690 --> 01:15:54.230
This, for instance, will give
you that in general for

01:15:54.230 --> 01:15:59.330
Reed-Muller codes, if you
divide them in half --

01:15:59.330 --> 01:16:06.570
we had this general picture of
say the 8 4 code being made up

01:16:06.570 --> 01:16:09.330
by the new u plus
v construction.

01:16:09.330 --> 01:16:15.190
These two together make
the 8, 4, 4 code.

01:16:15.190 --> 01:16:22.560
If you have the u u plus v
construction, there you are,

01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:24.750
first half, second half.

01:16:24.750 --> 01:16:27.560
You will find that the
projection on the first half

01:16:27.560 --> 01:16:32.700
is always this guy, which
is the u code.

01:16:32.700 --> 01:16:38.530
And the subcode is v code,
which is the homework.

01:16:38.530 --> 01:16:41.670
And so you can quickly read
off from this what the

01:16:41.670 --> 01:16:45.160
dimension of the central
state space is

01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:47.290
for Reed-Muller codes.

01:16:47.290 --> 01:16:49.135
In this case it's 2.

01:16:49.135 --> 01:16:57.400
But for instance if we have the
32, 16, 8 code, then what

01:16:57.400 --> 01:16:58.470
is that made up of?

01:16:58.470 --> 01:17:03.030
That's made up from the
16, 11, 4 code and

01:17:03.030 --> 01:17:06.720
the 16, 5, 8 code.

01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:09.320
And so we can see the dimension
of the central state

01:17:09.320 --> 01:17:11.540
space here is going to be 6.

01:17:11.540 --> 01:17:15.260
We're going to get a 64-state
trellis for this code, at

01:17:15.260 --> 01:17:20.230
least just measuring the size
of the central state space.

01:17:20.230 --> 01:17:24.590
Now it turns out you
can keep having --

01:17:24.590 --> 01:17:28.400
if you go down and you make
four cuts here, then the

01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:33.130
relevant codes are what you
get one more space back.

01:17:33.130 --> 01:17:37.390
At this space, we have the 2,
2, 1 as the projected code,

01:17:37.390 --> 01:17:41.080
and the 2, 0, infinity
as the subcode.

01:17:41.080 --> 01:17:43.620
And again, the difference in
dimensions here is going to be

01:17:43.620 --> 01:17:46.780
the same as the different
dimensions here.

01:17:46.780 --> 01:17:48.150
Minor miracle at first.

01:17:48.150 --> 01:17:51.630
It turns out to be just
from the construction.

01:17:51.630 --> 01:17:58.010
Here we go back to the 8,
7, 2 and the 8, 1, 8.

01:17:58.010 --> 01:18:02.110
And again we see the difference
here is 6.

01:18:02.110 --> 01:18:08.520
So that means that Reed-Muller
codes always have trellises,

01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:11.640
least if you put them
in four sections.

01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:16.080
They always look like
this abstractly.

01:18:16.080 --> 01:18:20.730
They look like what
we've already seen

01:18:20.730 --> 01:18:22.256
for the 8, 4, 4 code.

01:18:27.080 --> 01:18:29.700
And you'll do this on the
homework using projections.

01:18:29.700 --> 01:18:32.440
That's not very hard.

01:18:32.440 --> 01:18:34.510
It doesn't mean that --

01:18:34.510 --> 01:18:38.050
so we know, for instance, for
the 32 16 8, we're going to do

01:18:38.050 --> 01:18:41.560
this, and there are going to be
64 states here, 64 states

01:18:41.560 --> 01:18:43.680
here, 64 states here.

01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:45.760
We don't know what it's going to
be in between, but you can

01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:48.630
figure that out too.

01:18:48.630 --> 01:18:51.320
In fact, we get a minimal
trellis for the whole thing.

01:18:54.310 --> 01:18:55.780
That's what you need
to do the homework.

01:18:58.880 --> 01:19:01.300
There are actually two more
topics that I want to do in

01:19:01.300 --> 01:19:02.670
Chapter 10.

01:19:02.670 --> 01:19:05.500
One is the Muder bound.

01:19:05.500 --> 01:19:07.320
And one --

01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:11.440
I actually want to see how
good are these block code

01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:15.010
trellises vis-a-vis
convolutional code trellises.

01:19:15.010 --> 01:19:18.110
So I'll do both of those at the
beginning of next time.

01:19:18.110 --> 01:19:25.270
For homework problem set, let's
this week do only the

01:19:25.270 --> 01:19:28.240
first four problems.

01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:35.760
So for this Wednesday,
do problem set --

01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:36.480
what are we up to?

01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:39.260
Seven, is it?

01:19:39.260 --> 01:19:46.240
One through four, and for
Wednesday, 4/20, we'll do

01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:51.070
problem set seven, five and six,
plus I'll probably have

01:19:51.070 --> 01:19:52.150
another one.

01:19:52.150 --> 01:19:55.990
But we have a holiday next
Monday also if you recall,

01:19:55.990 --> 01:19:58.520
Patriots' Day.

01:19:58.520 --> 01:20:01.230
So we only get one more
class on Wednesday.

01:20:01.230 --> 01:20:05.770
So I probably won't have much
more to add than this.

01:20:05.770 --> 01:20:07.040
Is that clear?

01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:11.470
Maybe Ashish you could
put out a email to

01:20:11.470 --> 01:20:13.530
the class to do that.

01:20:13.530 --> 01:20:14.800
So good.

01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:18.570
We'll come back and clean
up Chapter 10 quickly on

01:20:18.570 --> 01:20:21.430
Wednesday, and then
move on to 11.
