00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.150
PROFESSOR: Good moRning.

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:04.019
Again, we're left with
a little stub of

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:07.020
chapter six to finish.

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.640
This was our first chapter on
binary linear block codes.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.810
Very briefly, last time we
developed the family of RM,

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.890
Reed-Muller codes, parameterized
by R and M.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.300
These are codes of length two
to the M, and distance 2 to

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.735
the M minus R for all reasonable
combinations of M

00:00:27.735 --> 00:00:29.460
and R, integers.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.570
And the reason I do these first
is because it gives us a

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.240
nice big -- in fact,
infinite --

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.050
family of codes that kind
of cover the waterfront.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.130
Let us see what we can
reasonably get in terms of the

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.860
parameters n k d in codes.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.510
And, of course, n k t d tell us
most of what we know, want

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.530
to know about the performance
of moderate complexity codes

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.820
in terms of coding gain.

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.290
And it's easy to see that among
these codes, we have

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.390
sequences in which the coding
gain goes -- the nominal

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.450
coding gain goes to infinity.

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.570
And we also know that there's
at least one sequence, the

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.660
bi-orthogonal sequence, for
which the effective coding

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.630
gain completely closes the
gap to the Shannon limit.

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.910
And in all likelihood, there
are many such sequences,

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.140
though I'm not aware of the
actual result there.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.960
So it seems like we might be
almost finished here, except I

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.000
asked about what possible fly
there could be in this

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.300
ointment last time.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.710
And one of you alertly reported
that we still really

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.990
hadn't worried about decoding.

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.290
And the implicit decoding
algorithm here is minimum

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:43.830
distance decoding.

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.640
Exhaustive minimum distance
decoding.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.980
We basically have to compute the
minimum distance to each

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.250
of the 2 to the k code words.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.100
And that's going to get a little
tedious as soon as k

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.210
gets up to 16 or 107
or whatever.

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.220
So it was recognized pretty
early in the development of

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.170
coding theory that this was
the essential problem.

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.340
The problem is not to construct
codes whose

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.920
performance under maximum
likelihood decoding is near

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.450
that of the Shannon limit
-- you can use

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.030
random codes for that.

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.950
But in constructing these more
algebraically structured

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.610
codes, what we're really trying
to do is to facilitate

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.640
the decoding problem, which
is the central problem.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.170
We need to find a
decoding method

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.820
that is actually feasible.

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.010
And, of course, Shannon didn't
address that at all.

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.540
He just addressed the ultimate
potential of these codes with

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.740
the optimal decoding technique
and didn't worry about its

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.200
complexity.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.640
All right.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.560
So I'd say the fundamental
problem here is decoding

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.810
complexity.

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.270
Now, one of the --

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:00.080
an awful lot of the early work
on coding was about binary

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.490
codes, of course.

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:10.070
But it also considered them in
the context of binary decoding

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.730
algorithms.

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.450
In other words, what's assumed
is what you send as a series

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.890
of bits and what you receive
as a series of bits.

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.700
That's not the picture we have
here in this course, where

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.050
what we receive is a series
of real numbers.

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.400
Because we're going over a
continuous additive white

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.115
Gaussian noise channel.

00:03:28.115 --> 00:03:31.750
Of course, there are channels
which are inherently digital,

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.610
at least by the time the coding
engineer can get his

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:35.610
hands on them.

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.400
What he's presented with
is a string of bits.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.390
So it makes sense to consider
codes for bit error

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.120
correction.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.980
Classic codes of this type
are, first of all, the

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.670
repetition code.

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:51.680
If I send this --

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.190
if I use the 7 1 7 code, the
repetition code of length 7,

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.370
I'm going to be able to correct
up to three errors.

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.450
Three bit errors.

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.680
Because four bits are still
going to be correct.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.480
In a majority vote, we'll
do the decoding.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.580
Most of you have probably
seen Hamming codes.

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.860
These are codes with minimum
Hamming distance 3.

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.649
That means if you make one
error, you're still within the

00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:20.240
Hamming sphere of radius 1
around the original code word.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:25.070
That's disjoined from all the
other Hamming spheres, and so

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.670
in principle you ought to be
able to do single error

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:30.560
correction with Hamming codes.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.180
And there are very simple
algorithms for doing that.

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.590
OK.

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.600
But that may be what
you have to do.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.450
The final point of chapter six
is that in the additive white

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:47.090
Gaussian noise context,
that's not what you

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:48.520
want to do at all.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.120
And I just want to say a few
words about that because this

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.140
is one of the Achille's heels
of a lot of classical coding

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.140
theory, which was addressed
to the binary

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:01.340
in, binary out situation.

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:05.040
So let's talk about the penalty

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.455
for making hard decisions.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.880
That is, by hard decision, we
mean a binary decision.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.130
0, 1, plus or minus 1.

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:25.390
And I'll do this fairly quickly,
but in a way that I

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:28.390
hope will stick.

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:33.800
Let me draw our block diagram
of our coding scheme.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.870
We've got a code.

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:42.820
We've got an encoder,
which basically

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:45.850
puts out a code word.

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:47.490
An n-tuple in the code.

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:51.060
I'm going to consider
the individual

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.230
elements of this n-tuple.

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:58.810
They're just elements of the
binary field F2 And we go

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:05.680
through our standard 2-PAM map,
which maps them to s of

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:10.210
xk, which is going
to be in plus or

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:11.750
minus alpha in general.

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:13.950
Just plus or minus 1.

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:16.240
Doesn't matter up to scaling.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.110
In order to send them, we're
going to send this sequence of

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:25.540
real numbers over the white
Gaussian noise channel.

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:29.610
And as a result, we're
going to get out s --

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:31.780
let's call it a received
symbol --

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:37.950
rk, which is the transmitted
symbol plus some Gaussian

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:40.270
noise symbol, nk.

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:43.045
This is a real number.

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:48.450
And then --

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:49.240
then what we do?

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.950
Now we're into the decoder.

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:54.610
This is what we received, so
it's free to us to choose what

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:55.860
to do next.

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:01.590
I'm going to say observe, first
of all, that without

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:07.630
loss of generality, we
can decompose rk

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:11.040
into a sign and magnitude.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:17.910
So this out here is going
to be a sign of rk.

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:23.160
And this is going to be
the magnitude of rk.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.300
And let me just give
this a name.

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:31.120
Let me call this yk, and let
me call this beta k.

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:31.600
OK.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:32.610
So what is this?

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:40.000
This is in plus or minus 1, and
this is in the positive

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.906
reals, so the non-negative
reals.

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:44.580
OK.

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:48.020
And clearly, if I keep both of
these, I haven't lost any

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:48.740
information.

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:51.770
This is just a way of
representing rk in sign and

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:54.290
magnitude form.

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:57.735
Now, this is what's called
the hard decision.

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:02.855
Actually, let me do
this differently.

00:08:02.855 --> 00:08:11.130
Let me pass this through the
inverse to a 2-PAM map.

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:13.610
So out of this, I get a yk,

00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:17.540
which is in F2 OK.

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:18.580
Either of these --

00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:24.680
the real sign or the binary
hard decision --

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:28.240
could be considered to
be the hard decision.

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:29.240
Now, what am I doing here?

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:32.720
I'm saying, well, if you force
me to make a guess on whether

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:36.710
this individual transmission was
sending a 0 or 1, this is

00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:39.050
the most obvious guess.

00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:42.839
If I send --

00:08:42.839 --> 00:08:50.100
here's minus 1, here's our minus
alpha, here's plus 1 --

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:55.400
if I sent a plus 1, then my
maximum likelihood per bit

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:58.710
decision would be to decide
the plus 1 was sent.

00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:02.940
If I get a positive sign in --

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:07.360
what I'm really mapping here is
rk, and minus 1 if I get a

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:08.100
negative side.

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:09.550
So that's what's called
a hard decision.

00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:12.530
I'm going to decide right here
what I think it was, what it

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:13.570
most likely was.

00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:15.260
And this is the best
way to do it.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.410
Just take the sign.

00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:22.740
This here is a real valued
weight, often called the

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:30.235
reliability, which is
helpful to retain.

00:09:30.235 --> 00:09:32.830
That's the main point
of what I'm going

00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:35.550
to talk to you about.

00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:36.990
If this is 0 --

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:40.900
that means what we received
was right on this boundary

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:44.390
between the positive and
negative side --

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:46.980
then the reliability is 0.

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:49.565
In likelihood terms, that means
it's equally likely that

00:09:49.565 --> 00:09:52.540
what was sent was a plus
1 or a minus 1.

00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:55.520
So in some sense, we get
no information when the

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:57.900
reliability is 0.

00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:01.080
Fails to discriminate between
plus 1 and minus 1.

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:03.880
The larger this is, the further
we get out here.

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:07.710
Or symmetrically, the further
we get out here, the more

00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:12.000
certain we are that in that
particular symbol, neither a

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.830
plus or a minus was sent.

00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:18.500
OK And it actually tuRns out,
if you work out the Gaussian

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:24.750
numbers, that beta k is the
log likelihood ratio up to

00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:28.830
scale of the more likely
versus the log of the

00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:32.920
likelihood, or the more likely
versus the less likely symbol.

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:35.010
So it has a minimum of 0.

00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:36.810
The bigger it is, the
more reliable.

00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:38.630
So it's natural to call
it the reliability.

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:42.770
OK.

00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:48.470
An awful lot of traditional
algebraic decoding neglects

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:50.910
this channel down here.

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:53.880
It just says, OK, let's take
these hard decisions and try

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:55.430
to decode them.

00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:58.510
If you've previously had a
coding class, then that's

00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:00.000
probably what they did.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.020
Or they assumed a context in
which this was never available

00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:05.900
in the first place.

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:10.110
And my only point here, my main
point, is that that's a

00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:13.150
very bad thing to do.

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:16.420
How can we evaluate that?

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:20.960
Suppose we just take this top
channel and don't look at the

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:21.720
reliability.

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:25.570
Then basically we have the
channel model becomes a binary

00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:26.550
symmetric channel.

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:35.640
We have bits in, bits out, and
we have probably one minus p

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:38.610
that if we send a
0 we get a 0.

00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:41.830
And since it's symmetric,
the same probability --

00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:43.690
if we send a 1, we get a 1 --

00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:45.610
and a probability p of
making an error.

00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:48.880
So we get the traditional
memoryless binary symmetric

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:50.580
channel model.

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:54.290
We can compute the capacity of
this model and compare it to

00:11:54.290 --> 00:11:59.590
the capacity of the additive
white Gaussian channel --

00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:01.960
this model.

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:05.930
And depending on the signal to
noise ratio, from a capacity

00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:10.880
calculation, we find that
there is of the order

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:14.880
of 2 or 3 dB loss.

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:17.640
Well, as we go on in this
course, we're going to find

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:21.250
that 1 dB is a very worthwhile
coding game.

00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:24.600
So to throw away 2 or 3 dB just
by throwing away this

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:28.810
information, is a
bad thing to do.

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:39.970
I can make this point in a
different way by simply

00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:45.650
looking at what's the optimum
decision rule.

00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:50.170
For say, let me take very simple
code, just the 2-1-2

00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:51.170
repetition code.

00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:54.010
That's just 0,0,1,1.

00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:58.720
This is the code where you
either send plus, plus, plus

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:04.910
alpha, plus alpha, or minus
alpha, minus alpha.

00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:09.045
And what's the decision
region?

00:13:09.045 --> 00:13:12.570
It's obviously this
45 degree line.

00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:15.800
And what is this squared
distance to

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:17.330
any decision region?

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:19.935
It's 2 alpha squared, right?

00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:26.560
So basically, the probability
of making an error is the

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:31.140
probability that the noise
variable has a magnitude in

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:34.980
this dimension, and in this
direction, greater than the

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:38.170
square root of 2
alpha squared.

00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:42.320
You've been through all those
calculation several times now.

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:42.710
All right.

00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:47.710
So this is -- if I keep
reliability info -- in other

00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:53.150
words, if I keep the full
received signal -- if I

00:13:53.150 --> 00:14:02.200
discard reliability, then
basically what can I get out?

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:07.760
Then my y, as I say, is in
0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1.

00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:14.000
There are only four possible
things I can see in two

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.910
transmissions through
this channel.

00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:19.650
They're all binary two-tuples.

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:22.420
And what does that mean?

00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:29.870
That means if my actual r is
in this quadrant, then I'm

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:34.510
going to make a hard decision
of 0 and 0 both times.

00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:37.280
So I'm going to say I'm
in this quadrant.

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:41.480
And likewise, I'm basically
going to decide which of these

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:44.230
four quadrants I'm in, and
that's all the information the

00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:45.480
decoder is going to have.

00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:51.370
So here I am at this
point here.

00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:55.200
Now the decoder simply knows,
via these two bits, which

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:57.980
quadrant you're in.

00:14:57.980 --> 00:14:59.800
Now, it has to decide
which of these two

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:01.960
code words were sent.

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:06.040
What's its maximum likelihood
decision rule given just this

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:07.290
information?

00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:13.646
AUDIENCE: 0, 0, [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:13.646 --> 00:15:15.098
0, 0, [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:15.098 --> 00:15:17.276
1, 1, 1, 1, 1.

00:15:17.276 --> 00:15:17.518
And in the other
case, any one.

00:15:17.518 --> 00:15:18.680
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:20.310
That's correct.

00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:22.550
So clearly, if you land
in this quadrant,

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:28.200
you decide 0, 0.

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:30.570
Now, if you land down
here, you decide

00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:34.190
1, 1 in this quadrant.

00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:37.750
And what am I going to
do here or here?

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:40.360
Actually, here the evidence
is totally balanced.

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:42.370
I have nothing that tells
me whether to

00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:44.530
go one way or another.

00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:46.990
I could make an arbitrary
decision in the hope of

00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:48.315
minimizing my error
probability.

00:15:48.315 --> 00:15:50.970
Flip a coin.

00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:56.496
But whichever decision I make,
what I'm going to find is that

00:15:56.496 --> 00:16:02.620
there's a probability of error
that -- there's a certain

00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:06.320
noise, namely the noise that
takes me from here to this

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:09.130
decision boundary that is
going to cause an error.

00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:11.630
Or if I decide the other way, it
would be the one that goes

00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:13.780
from here to here.

00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:14.920
So I'm going to be stuck.

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:20.440
There are going to be certain
noise variables of length,

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:26.790
now, merely alpha, or square
distance alpha squared, that

00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:30.290
are going to cause me to make a
decision error, ultimately.

00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:36.710
Regardless of how I set up
this final block here.

00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:38.871
Decoder.

00:16:38.871 --> 00:16:42.650
Whatever rule I give to this
decoder, it's only going to

00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:48.730
take, worst case, a noise of
squared magnitude alpha

00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:51.340
squared to cause an error.

00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:52.590
AUDIENCE:
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

00:16:55.561 --> 00:16:56.830
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:16:56.830 --> 00:16:59.420
I shouldn't have thrown
this away.

00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:03.250
That's the elementary point
I'm trying to make here.

00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:03.840
All right.

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:06.640
AUDIENCE:
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:10.432
the distance, d_min is
different, essentially.

00:17:10.432 --> 00:17:11.869
I mean, we can put
it that way.

00:17:11.869 --> 00:17:16.020
PROFESSOR: That's where I'm
going, is that the effective

00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:18.690
minimum squared distance here
is 2 alpha squared.

00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:21.530
And this is what shows up in
our union-bound estimate in

00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:24.250
all of our --

00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:26.410
we do this kind of minimum
distance decoding.

00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:30.080
But if I throw away this
important information, then my

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:31.745
effective minimum
squared distance

00:17:31.745 --> 00:17:32.980
is only alpha squared.

00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:35.490
That is the bottom line here.

00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:40.490
In dB terms, how much
of a cost is that?

00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:41.630
3 dB, right?

00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:46.000
So I've cost myself a factor
of 2 in noise margin.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.200
So 3 dB loss.

00:17:52.490 --> 00:18:00.720
Because of lack of time, I won't
go through the argument

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:05.810
in the notes, which shows that,
in fact, exactly the

00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:08.160
same thing occurs for any --

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:11.220
whenever the minimum Hamming
distance is even here in this

00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:15.770
code that I started from,
you lose precisely 3 dB.

00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:18.850
It's not quite as clean an
argument when the minimum

00:18:18.850 --> 00:18:20.460
Hamming distance is odd.

00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:24.790
Then you lose up to 3 dB, and
it goes to 3 dB as the

00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:26.580
distance increases.

00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:31.030
But there's a very, pretty
elementary geometric argument

00:18:31.030 --> 00:18:35.010
that hard decisions, again, cost
you 3 dB loss, which is

00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:36.810
consistent with what
the capacity

00:18:36.810 --> 00:18:38.410
calculation gives you.

00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:42.320
All right.

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:47.440
Well, obviously the reason we
did this is we were trying to

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:49.690
simplify things.

00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:54.840
What would be the first step to
unsimplify things and get

00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:56.170
some of this loss back?

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:07.060
Let me suggest that what this
amounts to is a two-level

00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:12.240
quantization of the received
real number rk.

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:15.440
What's the next number
higher than 2?

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:15.920
Integer.

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:17.340
AUDIENCE: 3.

00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:18.550
PROFESSOR: 3.

00:19:18.550 --> 00:19:19.260
All right.

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:23.860
How about a 3 level
quantization here?

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:25.735
OK.

00:19:25.735 --> 00:19:31.880
So what we're talking about is
a highly quantized magnitude

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:41.480
where instead of just making a
decision boundary here, which

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:45.350
is effectively what we did for
2 level quantization, let's

00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:53.620
make some null zone here between
some threshold plus t

00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:57.550
and some threshold minus t.

00:19:57.550 --> 00:20:02.920
And we'll say, in this region,
the received symbol is

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:05.370
unreliable.

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:05.810
OK.

00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:07.870
That's called an erasure.

00:20:07.870 --> 00:20:11.640
So we make a quantized
magnitude where rk --

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:21.490
doesn't fit so neatly here.

00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:26.020
Let me just say this quantized
magnitude is going to give me

00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:29.350
out something which is either
going to be minus 1,

00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:31.300
a 0, or plus 1.

00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:37.440
It's going to be three levels,
this is minus 1, 0, plus 1.

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:40.850
Or I don't want the
minus 1 there.

00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:44.817
The reliability is either a
fixed reliability, or it's 0.

00:20:44.817 --> 00:20:46.067
OK.

00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:56.660
So now I've got a channel model
that looks like this.

00:20:56.660 --> 00:21:02.690
If you work it out, it's called
the binary erasure

00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:04.380
channel with errors.

00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:06.210
All transitions are possible.

00:21:06.210 --> 00:21:08.010
I can send a 0,1.

00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:13.500
I can receive, let's call it,
a 0, a 1, or a question mark

00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:15.465
for -- this is called
an erasure.

00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:23.540
And this is 1 minus p minus q,
and this is p and this is q

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:30.080
symmetrically, for some p and
q, which you can evaluate.

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:35.440
And let's choose this threshold
t to optimize things

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:37.920
and get the maximum capacity.

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:40.530
Now if you do the capacity
calculation, you'll find

00:21:40.530 --> 00:21:44.510
there's only 1 to 1.5 dB loss.

00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:47.530
Again, depending on the
signal to noise ratio.

00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:50.320
So in effect, you've already
bought back, just with this

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:58.970
very simple method, half of the
loss that you inflicted on

00:21:58.970 --> 00:22:01.840
yourself by making
hard decisions.

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:08.930
So making erasures is a good
first step towards correcting

00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:11.770
this problem.

00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:15.520
And let's think about it again
for this simple code.

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:22.780
Suppose I establish these
thresholds at

00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:24.380
plus t and minus t.

00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:27.440
Plus t and minus t.

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:33.890
So now when I consider the
problem that the decoder has,

00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:38.300
I have nine possible regions,
all right, each with three

00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:44.370
possible decisions in
two dimensions.

00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:47.150
And so what's my decision
rule going to be now?

00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:55.050
For this 0, 0 decision, I'm
going to include, of course,

00:22:55.050 --> 00:22:56.290
this region.

00:22:56.290 --> 00:23:01.750
But now if I land in this
region, that means one of the

00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:04.210
received symbols was erased,
but the other one gave me a

00:23:04.210 --> 00:23:05.690
definite indication.

00:23:05.690 --> 00:23:09.020
So the weight of evidence
still goes up here.

00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:13.300
And similarly, like so.

00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:16.380
So my decision region for 0 --

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:20.740
definitely for 0, 0
is this region.

00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:26.900
And my decision region
definitely for 1, 1 is the

00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:29.750
symmetric region.

00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:32.590
And, of course, I still have
three regions where I really

00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:33.520
can't say anything.

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:35.360
This is two erasures.

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:36.720
This is 0, 1 --

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:38.560
two conflicting pieces
of evidence.

00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:39.660
This is 1, 0 -- two

00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:42.360
conflicting pieces of evidence.

00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:48.130
So I still have to flip
a coin out in here.

00:23:48.130 --> 00:23:53.550
But how I improve things, that's
measured by what's the

00:23:53.550 --> 00:23:54.880
minimum distance to --

00:23:57.820 --> 00:24:01.770
what's the minimum size of
error it takes to make a

00:24:01.770 --> 00:24:03.450
decision error.

00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:08.550
And that's going to be either
this length or this length.

00:24:08.550 --> 00:24:09.400
You see that?

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:11.125
Just pretty clear,
intuitively?

00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:18.040
So the game here is we first of
all choose t so that these

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:21.110
two lengths are the same.

00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:23.750
That's done by squeezing t.

00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:25.935
You see these go in opposite
directions as t

00:24:25.935 --> 00:24:27.540
is raised or lowered.

00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:31.100
So we find the t such that
these two are the same.

00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:37.050
Having equalized t, we find some
value for the effective

00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:40.000
minimum squared distance, which
is between alpha squared

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.800
and 2 alpha squared.

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:50.310
As I remember, this somehow
gains about 1.5 dB.

00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:51.390
The moral is about the same.

00:24:51.390 --> 00:24:55.880
You can get about half of your
loss back by using erasures.

00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:59.990
And again, this holds for any
code which has an even minimum

00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:02.060
Hamming distance, if
you can accept

00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:04.640
this method of analysis.

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:05.190
All right.

00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:10.870
So a first step, even if you
want to stay in the binary

00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:14.830
world, is to allow yourself
to use erasures as well.

00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:20.170
That will claw back half of the
loss that you might have

00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:22.240
incurred by using
hard decisions.

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:25.520
And, of course, even better
would be to use a more highly

00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:29.500
quantized reliability and
somehow have a decoding

00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:33.420
algorithm that can use
soft decisions.

00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:37.180
Soft decisions are decisions
that have reliability metrics

00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:39.900
attached to them.

00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:43.770
And in the early
days of coding,

00:25:43.770 --> 00:25:46.190
people evaluated capacity.

00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:48.420
They evaluated this
sort of thing.

00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:55.780
And it was pretty generally
agreed that eight level

00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:59.090
quantization was going to be
practically good enough.

00:25:59.090 --> 00:26:00.950
16 levels, certainly
good enough.

00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:05.070
Nowadays you typically
go up to 64 levels.

00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:07.130
You might go up to much higher
numbers if you have little

00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:09.050
other things to worry
about like timing

00:26:09.050 --> 00:26:10.760
recovery and so forth.

00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:14.620
But if you're purely in a
synchronized, symbol by symbol

00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:19.150
transmission, then three or
four bits of reliability

00:26:19.150 --> 00:26:21.210
information are going
to be enough.

00:26:21.210 --> 00:26:24.510
So from an engineering
point of view, that's

00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:25.430
a good way to go.

00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:28.820
Now, of course, you're going to
need a decoding algorithm

00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:32.440
that can use soft decisions.

00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:36.030
So as we go along, I'm going to
talk about error correcting

00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:41.200
decoding algorithms that are not
much, because correcting

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:43.830
errors only is a very bad
thing to do here.

00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:44.990
Errors and erasure.

00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:48.420
Correcting decoding algorithms,
which are fairly

00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:52.850
easy in algebraic
code context.

00:26:52.850 --> 00:26:57.170
And then finally soft decision
decoding algorithms, which is

00:26:57.170 --> 00:26:59.290
the kind we really want
on this channel.

00:26:59.290 --> 00:27:01.210
We really want to use
the soft decisions.

00:27:01.210 --> 00:27:04.070
We can't afford these
huge losses.

00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:08.710
We can't even afford 1 to
1 and a 1/2 dB loss.

00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:14.690
OK, so there's more set on
this in the last part of

00:27:14.690 --> 00:27:16.670
chapter six, but that's
all the time I want to

00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:18.650
spend on it in class.

00:27:18.650 --> 00:27:20.100
Does anyone have
any questions?

00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:21.080
yes?

00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:22.255
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:22.255 --> 00:27:24.626
transformation before we do
the quantization, can we

00:27:24.626 --> 00:27:26.754
change the shape of the
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:27:26.754 --> 00:27:30.602
regions such that we can
further improve the

00:27:30.602 --> 00:27:33.007
[INAUDIBLE PHRASE]

00:27:33.007 --> 00:27:35.412
improve the decoding?

00:27:35.412 --> 00:27:38.500
PROFESSOR: Well, that's
an interesting idea.

00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:41.880
But think about it from
an information

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:43.570
theoretic point of view.

00:27:43.570 --> 00:27:48.560
Can you actually get more
information by introducing a

00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:51.140
one-to-one transformation,
whether it's linear or

00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:53.011
nonlinear, whatever?

00:27:53.011 --> 00:27:58.810
AUDIENCE: The point is, the
original quantization is based

00:27:58.810 --> 00:28:02.926
on a straight line,
[INAUDIBLE PHRASE].

00:28:02.926 --> 00:28:04.176
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:08.640
PROFESSOR: You want to put a
curved line on this plane?

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:09.842
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:09.842 --> 00:28:12.190
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:14.850
That's going to imply decisions
that are not symbol

00:28:14.850 --> 00:28:17.050
by symbol decisions.

00:28:17.050 --> 00:28:22.200
That's going to imply that you
need to save r1 and r 2 in

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:26.220
order even to just decide where
you're in this and then

00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:30.250
go through some kind of
quantization on the plane.

00:28:30.250 --> 00:28:33.170
And once you've got r1 and r2
and you're trying to draw

00:28:33.170 --> 00:28:35.610
crazy boundaries, I suggest it's
going to be simpler to

00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:38.990
just compute the Euclidean
distance to each of these

00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:48.922
points, which results in
this decision region.

00:28:48.922 --> 00:28:50.172
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE PHRASE].

00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:56.770
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:28:56.770 --> 00:28:59.660
I don't see the rationale for
it yet, but there's been a

00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:01.570
million innovations in this
business, and you

00:29:01.570 --> 00:29:02.820
might have a good idea.

00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:11.170
Any other comments?

00:29:11.170 --> 00:29:15.242
I really appreciate comments
that go anywhere.

00:29:15.242 --> 00:29:17.590
I like to address them now
when they're ripe.

00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:23.200
OK.

00:29:25.570 --> 00:29:28.520
So let's go on to chapter
seven and eight.

00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:29.770
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] here.

00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:41.770
Chapters seven and eight
are closely related.

00:29:41.770 --> 00:29:45.565
This is really my bow to
algebraic coding theory.

00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:58.800
I expect that if any of you
have had a close course in

00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:01.370
coding before, that it
was primarily on

00:30:01.370 --> 00:30:04.336
algebraic coding theory.

00:30:04.336 --> 00:30:06.770
How many of you have
had a course in

00:30:06.770 --> 00:30:09.210
coding theory before?

00:30:09.210 --> 00:30:10.980
One, two, three.

00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:11.960
Not so many.

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:14.680
Was it on algebraic
coding theory?

00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:15.120
Yes?

00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:16.390
AUDIENCE: I [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
two, one

00:30:16.390 --> 00:30:17.731
engineering and one algebraic.

00:30:17.731 --> 00:30:18.450
PROFESSOR: Excuse me?

00:30:18.450 --> 00:30:21.235
AUDIENCE: Two -- one for --
actually, two algebraic and

00:30:21.235 --> 00:30:23.420
one out of kind of this stuff.

00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:24.440
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:26.140
Well, you're a ringer then.

00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:27.510
What was the one
on this stuff?

00:30:27.510 --> 00:30:29.106
AUDIENCE: It was out
of Wicker's book.

00:30:29.106 --> 00:30:29.760
PROFESSOR: Out of?

00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:30.620
AUDIENCE: Wicker's book.

00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:32.764
PROFESSOR: Wicker's book
on turbo codes.

00:30:32.764 --> 00:30:34.862
AUDIENCE: No, the data
storage one.

00:30:34.862 --> 00:30:36.180
PROFESSOR: Data storage.

00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:37.150
OK.

00:30:37.150 --> 00:30:39.800
I don't know that book.

00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:43.640
But it talks about sophisticated
soft decision

00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:45.210
type coding, and so forth.

00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:46.460
What was the course you took?

00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:47.310
AUDIENCE: Algebra.

00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:49.330
PROFESSOR: Algebraic.

00:30:49.330 --> 00:30:50.580
OK.

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:52.500
All right.

00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:58.910
Well, let me just make a broad
brush comment, which may or

00:30:58.910 --> 00:31:00.910
may not be supported
by your previous

00:31:00.910 --> 00:31:02.130
exposure to coding theory.

00:31:02.130 --> 00:31:08.280
Which is that for many, many
years, when people said coding

00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:11.910
theory, they meant algebraic
coding theory, coding theory

00:31:11.910 --> 00:31:14.800
of block codes that are
constructed by algebraic

00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:18.100
techniques like Reed-Muller
codes, like Reed-Solomon

00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:22.320
codes, BCH codes,
cyclic codes.

00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:25.900
And if you said, I want to
leaRn some coding theory,

00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:29.210
asked your graduate student to
go buy a textbook for you,

00:31:29.210 --> 00:31:30.450
it's probably going to
be a textbook on

00:31:30.450 --> 00:31:33.170
algebraic coding theory.

00:31:33.170 --> 00:31:38.520
Meanwhile, there was a bunch
of us who were off actually

00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:42.830
trying to construct codes
for real channels.

00:31:42.830 --> 00:31:48.130
And conceRning with really how
complex this is to implement,

00:31:48.130 --> 00:31:51.540
and what kind of performance
can we really get.

00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:56.640
And we hardly ever used
algebraic codes.

00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:59.580
Initially, we used convolutional
codes with

00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:02.970
various kinds of decoding
algorithms, threshold

00:32:02.970 --> 00:32:08.000
decoding, sequential decoding,
the Viterbi algorithm.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.520
And these get more and more
elaborate, and then finally

00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:17.530
the big step, well, the big
step was to capacity

00:32:17.530 --> 00:32:18.630
approaching codes.

00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:24.110
Which now people are starting to
call modeRn coding theory.

00:32:24.110 --> 00:32:26.710
Long, random-like codes
that have an

00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:28.820
iterative decoding algorithm.

00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:30.180
And that's what we'll
get to towards

00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:31.740
the end of this course.

00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:38.050
So from an engineers point of
view, to some extent, of all

00:32:38.050 --> 00:32:42.810
this work on n k d and algebraic
decoding algorithms

00:32:42.810 --> 00:32:46.675
and so forth was a massive
distraction.

00:32:46.675 --> 00:32:49.530
It really missed the point.

00:32:49.530 --> 00:32:53.510
Sometimes because it assumed
hard decisions.

00:32:53.510 --> 00:32:56.830
Or after assuming hard
decisions, it assumed bounded

00:32:56.830 --> 00:32:59.140
distance decoding algorithms.

00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:01.170
But it was all --

00:33:01.170 --> 00:33:04.630
from Shannon's perspective, it
was too deterministic, too

00:33:04.630 --> 00:33:06.530
constructed, too structured.

00:33:06.530 --> 00:33:11.260
You want more random elements
in your coding scheme.

00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:17.700
However, two things: one, this
theory is a beautiful theory,

00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:21.480
both the mathematical theory
of finite fields and the

00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:27.770
coding theory, particularly of
Reed-Solomon codes, which are

00:33:27.770 --> 00:33:30.280
uniquely the greatest
accomplishment of algebraic

00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:35.220
coding theory, and which have
proved to be very useful.

00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:44.140
And B, Reed-Solomon codes are
something that as engineers,

00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:47.210
ought to be part of your tool
kit, and you will find very

00:33:47.210 --> 00:33:49.550
useful a variety
of situations.

00:33:49.550 --> 00:33:55.360
So the objective of this part of
the course is, within some

00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:58.680
proportion within the overall
scheme of the course, to give

00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:02.430
you exposure to this
lovely theory.

00:34:02.430 --> 00:34:07.470
You can leaRn all about it just
by reading a book or two.

00:34:07.470 --> 00:34:10.750
Probably less than one book.

00:34:10.750 --> 00:34:13.310
And to give you some exposure
to Reed-Solomon codes, which

00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:15.170
have been used in practice.

00:34:19.909 --> 00:34:24.120
For more than 20 years, the
deep space standard was a

00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:25.370
concatenated code.

00:34:25.370 --> 00:34:29.770
That means a sequence of two
codes, of which the inner code

00:34:29.770 --> 00:34:32.520
was a convolutional code
decoded by the Viterbi

00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:35.320
algorithm, which we'll talk
about after this.

00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:38.989
And then the outer code, the
code that cleans up errors

00:34:38.989 --> 00:34:44.530
made by the inner code, was a
Reed-Solomon code of length

00:34:44.530 --> 00:34:49.219
255 over the finite field
with 256 elements.

00:34:49.219 --> 00:34:54.610
And that's the dynamite
combination that dominated the

00:34:54.610 --> 00:34:57.760
power-limited coding world
for at least 20 years.

00:34:57.760 --> 00:34:59.840
So you ought to know,
as a minimum, about

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:01.500
Reed-Solomon codes.

00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:05.040
So that's my objective
in going through

00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:06.460
these next two chapters.

00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:10.660
However, because these have
not basically been on the

00:35:10.660 --> 00:35:16.050
winning path to get to the
Shannon limit, I'm trying to

00:35:16.050 --> 00:35:19.400
limit it to three weeks max.

00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:23.190
And therefore, that means that
the presentation is going to

00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:27.040
be a lot faster than what
you're used to.

00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:30.390
I'll probably do as much in
these three weeks as most

00:35:30.390 --> 00:35:32.390
people do in a term in
an entire algebraic

00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:34.750
coding theory course.

00:35:34.750 --> 00:35:36.990
That's an exaggeration --

00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:39.810
people do a lot more -- but I
try to at least hit all the

00:35:39.810 --> 00:35:41.190
main points that you
need to know.

00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:46.000
So I apologize in advance if it
seems that now we're on a

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.790
very fast moving train.

00:35:48.790 --> 00:35:50.450
But you ought to know
this stuff.

00:35:50.450 --> 00:35:52.600
You ought not to spend
too much time on it.

00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:56.670
I'm trying to reconcile those
two points of view.

00:35:56.670 --> 00:35:59.930
Any questions or comments?

00:35:59.930 --> 00:36:00.290
All right.

00:36:00.290 --> 00:36:01.540
Let's go.

00:36:03.910 --> 00:36:07.240
Chapter seven.

00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:13.865
We go through a series
of algebraic objects.

00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:21.100
First, the integers,
then groups.

00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:23.850
You certainly ought to know --
you do know about integers.

00:36:23.850 --> 00:36:26.460
You ought to know about groups,
at least a little bit.

00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:29.580
Let's see.

00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:30.510
What's next?

00:36:30.510 --> 00:36:35.415
Then fields, particularly
finite.

00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:47.670
Then polynomials over fields,
particularly finite.

00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:54.130
And then finally, from this we
actually get to construct

00:36:54.130 --> 00:36:55.380
finite fields.

00:36:58.180 --> 00:37:03.180
And these are all things that
you'll encounter again and

00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:05.590
again, have encountered.

00:37:05.590 --> 00:37:07.660
I think you've probably
encountered everything except

00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:10.810
possibly for groups
and finite fields.

00:37:10.810 --> 00:37:13.340
You certainly encountered
polynomials over real and

00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:16.410
complex fields.

00:37:16.410 --> 00:37:19.890
And so in some sense, this is
a broadening of what you

00:37:19.890 --> 00:37:21.140
already know.

00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:32.600
So I assume we start with the
integers for two reasons.

00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:39.820
One is you already know about
the factorization properties

00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:42.250
of the integers.

00:37:42.250 --> 00:37:43.020
We're going to --

00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:46.990
that leads to a little bit of
number theory, which we're

00:37:46.990 --> 00:37:52.250
going to use when we talk about
groups, finite groups,

00:37:52.250 --> 00:37:54.640
cyclic groups.

00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:56.600
So this is just to remind
you, but it's

00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:59.440
also to put up a template.

00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:03.030
And we're going to find the
algebraic properties of

00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:05.830
polynomials are very,
very similar to

00:38:05.830 --> 00:38:06.890
those of the integers.

00:38:06.890 --> 00:38:08.820
This is because they're
both rings.

00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:11.420
They're both in fact principal
ideal domains.

00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:12.690
They're Euclidean domains.

00:38:12.690 --> 00:38:15.670
They both have a Euclidean
division algorithm as their

00:38:15.670 --> 00:38:18.230
key mathematical property.

00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:21.650
And so pretty much any time you
want to develop a result

00:38:21.650 --> 00:38:26.680
about the polynomials, you can
start from the comparable

00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:29.200
results that you know about the
integers and just change

00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:30.460
the notation.

00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:36.320
And you'll have a sketch of
the proof for polynomials.

00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:40.990
So it's important to remind
ourselves about

00:38:40.990 --> 00:38:43.590
the integers first.

00:38:43.590 --> 00:38:46.050
Now, when I say the
factorization properties of

00:38:46.050 --> 00:38:48.310
the integers, I'm not talking
about anything more

00:38:48.310 --> 00:38:51.400
complicated than what you
leaRned in grade school.

00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:55.120
I just want to introduce
a few terms.

00:38:55.120 --> 00:39:00.670
We have the notion
of divisors.

00:39:00.670 --> 00:39:09.685
a divides b means that a times
some quotient equals b.

00:39:09.685 --> 00:39:16.400
I could be talking about plus or
minus, positive or negative

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:17.340
integers here.

00:39:17.340 --> 00:39:18.590
Everything divides 0.

00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:22.120
OK.

00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:29.620
We have the idea of units,
which are the invertible

00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:33.140
integers under multiplication.

00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:34.390
And what are those?

00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:41.600
Which integers have a
multiplicative inverse?

00:39:44.980 --> 00:39:45.340
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:45.970
any of them?

00:39:45.970 --> 00:39:47.802
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE PHRASE].

00:39:47.802 --> 00:39:49.170
PROFESSOR: [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:49.170 --> 00:39:50.420
All right.

00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:57.530
That's a little exercise that
shows you that, in general,

00:39:57.530 --> 00:40:01.870
the invertible elements of any
set that has an operation like

00:40:01.870 --> 00:40:06.190
multiplication form a group.

00:40:06.190 --> 00:40:09.750
[INAUDIBLE] group thing, these
clearly form a group under

00:40:09.750 --> 00:40:11.320
multiplication that's
isomorphic

00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:12.725
to the binary group.

00:40:12.725 --> 00:40:14.780
Well, in fact, we've already
been using it --

00:40:14.780 --> 00:40:16.380
F2.

00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:16.830
OK.

00:40:16.830 --> 00:40:21.620
So we have units, and whenever
we talk about the divisors,

00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:24.420
factorization, primes,
so forth,

00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:25.700
the units are a nuisance.

00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:29.790
Because we can always multiply
things by units and it doesn't

00:40:29.790 --> 00:40:33.370
affect factorization
properties.

00:40:33.370 --> 00:40:35.810
This is [UNINTELLIGIBLE] a
little bit more out there.

00:40:41.515 --> 00:40:45.530
What I eventually want
to get to is --

00:40:45.530 --> 00:40:49.510
skipping a few things that
are said in the notes --

00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:50.866
is unique factorization.

00:40:55.900 --> 00:41:05.520
Maybe before that I should
define primes:

00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:07.380
are positive integers.

00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:10.862
The reason we stay positive
is, again --

00:41:10.862 --> 00:41:14.610
of course, we could have a
negative prime integer, but

00:41:14.610 --> 00:41:17.230
let's pick a unique
representative of two units.

00:41:20.290 --> 00:41:21.860
Positive integers --

00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:24.330
I should've said in the notes
greater than 1, we don't

00:41:24.330 --> 00:41:25.625
consider 1 to be a prime --

00:41:28.170 --> 00:41:34.515
that have no non-trivial
divisors.

00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:44.780
And, of course, every integer
has trivial divisors.

00:41:49.790 --> 00:41:55.460
Namely, plus or minus 1 and
plus or minus itself.

00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:57.205
Let me give this a name.

00:41:57.205 --> 00:41:57.580
i.

00:41:57.580 --> 00:42:00.140
Not a very good name.

00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:01.390
How about n?

00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:06.300
So if we have any integer n,
it's divisible by plus or

00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:08.940
minus one, plus or minus n --

00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:11.940
that doesn't count.

00:42:11.940 --> 00:42:15.120
So a prime is an integer that
doesn't have any other

00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:18.300
divisors than these
trivial ones.

00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:22.610
And then I want to get to unique
factorization, which

00:42:22.610 --> 00:42:24.080
I'll just state, not prove.

00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:41.760
Which is that every integer
is equal to a

00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:43.310
unique product of primes.

00:42:50.366 --> 00:42:53.840
And we always have to
add up to units.

00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:57.860
We can add as many plus or minus
1's to the product as we

00:42:57.860 --> 00:43:01.990
want, as long as we have
an even number of them.

00:43:01.990 --> 00:43:04.200
And we'll have another
factorization, so here, we

00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:06.960
want to exclude the units.

00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:11.730
And then we have unique
factorization.

00:43:11.730 --> 00:43:12.260
OK.

00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:15.770
This is all grade school
stuff, high

00:43:15.770 --> 00:43:17.020
school stuff maybe.

00:43:20.910 --> 00:43:23.750
Again, when I go through
polynomials, you'll see there

00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:28.610
is a set of concept
exactly like this.

00:43:28.610 --> 00:43:35.540
Now, where we want to get to
is mod-n arithmetic, which

00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:39.820
again, you all know
about, I assume.

00:43:39.820 --> 00:43:42.300
This is based on the fact --

00:43:42.300 --> 00:43:45.860
we can think of it as being
based on Euclidean division

00:43:45.860 --> 00:43:51.940
algorithm, which basically
proves that given any two

00:43:51.940 --> 00:44:06.280
integers m and n, we can write m
as some qn plus r where 0 is

00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:09.765
less than or equal to r, less
than or equal to n minus 1,

00:44:09.765 --> 00:44:13.470
and is called the remainder
of m, modulo n.

00:44:16.370 --> 00:44:17.790
And how is this proved?

00:44:17.790 --> 00:44:20.330
Let's say these are both
positive integers.

00:44:20.330 --> 00:44:24.200
Say m is a big integer,
n is a small integer.

00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:29.600
We just keep subtracting integer
multiples of n from m

00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:30.555
until we --

00:44:30.555 --> 00:44:33.470
you know, the remainder will
start decreasing until we get

00:44:33.470 --> 00:44:36.780
the remainder in this range, and
it's obvious that we can

00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:39.710
always get a remainder
that's in that range.

00:44:39.710 --> 00:44:43.840
And further, that this
decomposition is unique under

00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:45.090
this restriction on r.

00:44:49.870 --> 00:44:50.330
All right.

00:44:50.330 --> 00:45:03.080
So we write the m is congruent
or equivalent to r mod n.

00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:10.260
That means it differs from r by
a multiple of n where r is

00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:18.000
unique and r is in the set 0, 1,
up through n minus 1, which

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.350
we say are the residue
classes mod n.

00:45:20.350 --> 00:45:23.970
It has to be one of
those n things.

00:45:23.970 --> 00:45:25.220
OK?

00:45:26.910 --> 00:45:28.840
No one is having the slightest
trouble with this, right?

00:45:28.840 --> 00:45:29.285
Boring.

00:45:29.285 --> 00:45:31.180
You've seen it all before.

00:45:31.180 --> 00:45:32.430
I hope.

00:45:34.700 --> 00:45:35.950
OK.

00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:52.290
So now you ask, suppose m equals
r mod-n, and some other

00:45:52.290 --> 00:45:57.070
w equals s mod-n.

00:45:57.070 --> 00:46:07.230
What is m plus w mod-n, and you
quickly prove that it's

00:46:07.230 --> 00:46:10.690
equal to r plus s mod-n.

00:46:13.530 --> 00:46:17.970
By transferring, by just
checking the properties of

00:46:17.970 --> 00:46:21.140
ordinary arithmetic, you can use
this kind of expression: m

00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:25.030
must equal something
times n plus r.

00:46:25.030 --> 00:46:28.670
w must equal something
times n plus s.

00:46:28.670 --> 00:46:32.850
So if we add m plus w, we're
going to get something times n

00:46:32.850 --> 00:46:34.860
plus r plus s.

00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:41.070
And that is, by definition,
going to be r plus s mod-n.

00:46:41.070 --> 00:46:43.900
So we get a well-defined
addition rule for these

00:46:43.900 --> 00:46:50.590
residues, for the elements of
this set of n residues Rn, or

00:46:50.590 --> 00:46:52.630
remainders.

00:46:52.630 --> 00:46:55.980
OK, so addition is
well-defined.

00:46:55.980 --> 00:47:00.790
And similarly, multiplication
is well-defined.

00:47:00.790 --> 00:47:04.950
mw mod-n, again, you can prove
-- and this is done

00:47:04.950 --> 00:47:06.200
in the notes --

00:47:09.180 --> 00:47:14.930
that if mw mod-n can be
found by taking rs and

00:47:14.930 --> 00:47:17.984
reducing it, mod-n.

00:47:17.984 --> 00:47:20.650
Maybe I should have congruent
signs here, but I

00:47:20.650 --> 00:47:22.920
won't worry about it.

00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:34.150
So this is mod-n, addition
and multiplication.

00:47:34.150 --> 00:47:39.930
So what this says is that Rn,
combined with this mod-n

00:47:39.930 --> 00:47:44.460
addition operation, which in the
notes I write in that way,

00:47:44.460 --> 00:47:47.885
and this mod-n multiplication
operation --

00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:56.190
this is a well-defined set of n
elements with a well-defined

00:47:56.190 --> 00:47:59.040
addition operation and
a well-defined

00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:01.464
multiplication operation.

00:48:01.464 --> 00:48:04.520
And I don't prove any properties
about it here, but

00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:10.160
I come back to prove that this
has almost all of the

00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:14.720
properties that we
want of a field.

00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:17.850
In fact, if n is a prime, it
does have the properties that

00:48:17.850 --> 00:48:19.510
we want of a field.

00:48:19.510 --> 00:48:25.910
So we'll later prove that the
finite field with p elements

00:48:25.910 --> 00:48:35.720
is simply rp with mod-p addition
and multiplication.

00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:39.490
And, of course, for the
particular case p equals 2, we

00:48:39.490 --> 00:48:41.510
already have a lot of experience
with this.

00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:43.000
That's how we get the
binary field.

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:48.340
We just take the 0 and 1,
considered as residues mod-2.

00:48:48.340 --> 00:48:55.630
And then the field addition and
multiplication operations

00:48:55.630 --> 00:48:59.320
give us something that
satisfies the

00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:01.960
axioms of the field.

00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:05.240
We'll find that works for every
prime, and it doesn't

00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:07.085
work for non-primes.

00:49:07.085 --> 00:49:10.360
Can anyone quickly see why this
isn't going to work for

00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:11.610
non-primes?

00:49:15.010 --> 00:49:16.500
Suppose n equals 6.

00:49:21.270 --> 00:49:28.400
Anyone quickly see why this set
under these two operations

00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:30.290
isn't going to be a field?

00:49:30.290 --> 00:49:32.950
This, of course, assumes that
you know what a field is,

00:49:32.950 --> 00:49:36.280
which we haven't actually
said yet.

00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:37.765
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:37.765 --> 00:49:38.525
PROFESSOR: Excuse me?

00:49:38.525 --> 00:49:41.000
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:43.200
PROFESSOR: There's no inverse.

00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:47.810
In a field, every non-zero
element has to have an

00:49:47.810 --> 00:49:52.740
inverse, just like in the
real and complex field.

00:49:52.740 --> 00:50:00.290
But in the integers mod-6, 3
times 2 is equal to 6, which

00:50:00.290 --> 00:50:01.890
is equal to 0.

00:50:01.890 --> 00:50:06.080
So there are two non-zero
elements that multiplied

00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:07.645
together give 0.

00:50:07.645 --> 00:50:11.170
And that means that neither 3
nor 2 can possibly have a

00:50:11.170 --> 00:50:14.330
multiplicative inverse.

00:50:14.330 --> 00:50:17.910
So that's why you have
to have a prime.

00:50:17.910 --> 00:50:23.490
This doesn't happen, of course,
if n were a prime.

00:50:23.490 --> 00:50:23.900
OK.

00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:28.360
So that's just a little warm
up to remind you what mod-n

00:50:28.360 --> 00:50:29.780
arithmetic is like.

00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:34.780
And in particular, this is going
to be the key element of

00:50:34.780 --> 00:50:37.350
a lot of proofs --

00:50:37.350 --> 00:50:39.960
the Euclidean division
algorithm --

00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:43.140
both for integers and
for polynomials.

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:49.660
OK.

00:50:49.660 --> 00:50:52.185
So that, I hope, was review.

00:50:57.040 --> 00:50:58.530
Now we're going to talk
about groups.

00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:03.600
So let's do it.

00:51:08.220 --> 00:51:10.250
How many of you feel you
know what a group is?

00:51:14.690 --> 00:51:16.960
Less than half the class.

00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:18.250
OK.

00:51:18.250 --> 00:51:26.020
Well, we've been talking about
groups so far here, but let's

00:51:26.020 --> 00:51:29.450
take a little bit more of
an axiomatic approach.

00:51:29.450 --> 00:51:33.270
In the notes, I actually give
two possible sets of axioms

00:51:33.270 --> 00:51:34.020
for a group.

00:51:34.020 --> 00:51:36.920
Let me start with
a standard one.

00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:39.710
You've heard of something called
the group property in

00:51:39.710 --> 00:51:40.960
this course.

00:51:45.450 --> 00:51:49.490
Well, first of all, what am I
talking about when I'm talking

00:51:49.490 --> 00:51:50.080
about a group?

00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:54.670
I'm talking about a set, g,
and I'm also talking about

00:51:54.670 --> 00:51:58.750
some operation on that set,
which I'll use the mod

00:51:58.750 --> 00:52:04.370
addition circle-plus as
the group property.

00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:12.650
Even if it's multiplication or
matrix inversion or -- no, it

00:52:12.650 --> 00:52:15.690
couldn't be matrix inversion.

00:52:15.690 --> 00:52:21.800
What this means is that if we
take any two elements of the

00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:27.430
group, then a plus b
is well-defined.

00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:34.850
So you can think there's
a table.

00:52:34.850 --> 00:52:36.840
Here are the elements
of the group.

00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:39.385
a, b, c, d, e.

00:52:39.385 --> 00:52:41.860
a, b, c, d, e.

00:52:41.860 --> 00:52:46.390
And at this point, all we
know is that we can

00:52:46.390 --> 00:52:48.580
fill out the table.

00:52:48.580 --> 00:52:50.540
We get something that
goes in all here.

00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:54.200
All right?

00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:56.137
So that defines the group.

00:52:56.137 --> 00:52:58.999
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE PHRASE].

00:52:58.999 --> 00:53:02.500
PROFESSOR: That means if I
give a and b, then the

00:53:02.500 --> 00:53:05.140
quantity a plus b is --

00:53:05.140 --> 00:53:07.380
I can tell you what c is.

00:53:07.380 --> 00:53:10.060
There's a unique element in
each of the cells of this

00:53:10.060 --> 00:53:13.072
addition table, or
the group table.

00:53:15.970 --> 00:53:16.780
OK.

00:53:16.780 --> 00:53:25.540
Group property, also called
closure, is the obvious one.

00:53:28.760 --> 00:53:31.770
What's an elementary condition
of what all these sums have to

00:53:31.770 --> 00:53:33.715
be for this to be a group?

00:53:42.460 --> 00:53:43.710
Have to be all in the group.

00:53:49.350 --> 00:53:52.826
If I say I have a group that
consists of 1,2,3,4,5,

00:53:52.826 --> 00:53:59.820
1,2,3,4,5 and my group
operation is ordinary

00:53:59.820 --> 00:54:03.445
addition, then I can certainly
fill out the table.

00:54:03.445 --> 00:54:06.820
And I get 2,3,4,5,6 --

00:54:06.820 --> 00:54:08.990
whoops.

00:54:08.990 --> 00:54:11.450
Yeah, that's the element that's
not in the group.

00:54:11.450 --> 00:54:18.790
So in order to have a
group, I want a --

00:54:18.790 --> 00:54:23.870
I mean, it's a plus b is in
the group, all a and b.

00:54:26.430 --> 00:54:30.640
So the group is closed
under addition.

00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:35.200
This was the property we used to
define linearity for binary

00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:37.150
linear block codes.

00:54:37.150 --> 00:54:39.500
The sum of any two n-tuples
had to be another

00:54:39.500 --> 00:54:40.750
n-tuple in the code.

00:54:47.260 --> 00:54:53.920
We have the associativity
operation.

00:54:53.920 --> 00:55:03.745
This is a requirement on the
binary operation, really.

00:55:03.745 --> 00:55:10.190
a plus b plus c has got to be
equal to a plus b plus c.

00:55:10.190 --> 00:55:15.870
In other words, you can get
rid of the parentheses.

00:55:15.870 --> 00:55:20.560
And this, an expression like
that, is meaningful.

00:55:20.560 --> 00:55:23.980
It doesn't matter how you group,
whether you add these

00:55:23.980 --> 00:55:27.480
two things first and then that,
or add these two things

00:55:27.480 --> 00:55:28.730
first and then that.

00:55:32.390 --> 00:55:38.300
Maybe now is a good time to
talk about the special

00:55:38.300 --> 00:55:41.870
property, which is
not an axiom.

00:55:41.870 --> 00:55:47.036
So let me call it x abelian, or
the commutative property.

00:55:52.700 --> 00:55:59.590
This is true if a plus
b is equal to b

00:55:59.590 --> 00:56:05.692
plus a, all a, b group.

00:56:05.692 --> 00:56:09.200
Now this is, of course, true
for ordinary addition and

00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:11.340
ordinary multiplication.

00:56:11.340 --> 00:56:13.840
It's not true for matrix
multiplication.

00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:17.960
Say if I have a group of
matrices, then in general, ab

00:56:17.960 --> 00:56:19.460
is not equal to ba.

00:56:19.460 --> 00:56:22.100
So for some groups this
holds, for some

00:56:22.100 --> 00:56:23.350
groups it doesn't hold.

00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:31.130
In this course, almost without
exception, every group we're

00:56:31.130 --> 00:56:33.490
going to talk about is
an abelian group.

00:56:33.490 --> 00:56:36.450
That means that in adding
things up, the

00:56:36.450 --> 00:56:38.670
order doesn't matter.

00:56:38.670 --> 00:56:43.170
So if that were true, then it in
a plus b plus c, that means

00:56:43.170 --> 00:56:45.650
that's the same as c plus
b plus a, or c plus

00:56:45.650 --> 00:56:46.960
a plus b, or whatever.

00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:48.910
All the properties that
you're accustomed to

00:56:48.910 --> 00:56:51.110
from ordinary addition.

00:56:51.110 --> 00:56:53.940
But this is not one of the group
axioms, and, of course,

00:56:53.940 --> 00:56:56.770
there are non-abelian groups.

00:56:56.770 --> 00:57:00.520
The smallest non-abelian group
has size 6, and is the

00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:04.630
permutation group on
three elements.

00:57:04.630 --> 00:57:07.550
So small groups are all --

00:57:07.550 --> 00:57:10.015
size 5 or less are
all abelian.

00:57:10.015 --> 00:57:14.020
Because that's the only way
we can do the group table.

00:57:14.020 --> 00:57:14.410
All right.

00:57:14.410 --> 00:57:16.260
So that's terminology
at this point.

00:57:16.260 --> 00:57:17.930
It's not part of the axiom.

00:57:17.930 --> 00:57:22.040
But that's the reason that I use
a symbol that looks like a

00:57:22.040 --> 00:57:25.100
plus, is I'm pretty much always
thinking an abelian

00:57:25.100 --> 00:57:27.700
group, and I don't want to
trouble you with thinking

00:57:27.700 --> 00:57:30.830
about non-abelian groups.

00:57:30.830 --> 00:57:32.610
OK.

00:57:32.610 --> 00:57:35.230
Then we have the identity
property.

00:57:38.610 --> 00:57:42.770
There is an identity, which,
in an abelian group, is

00:57:42.770 --> 00:57:44.500
always called --

00:57:44.500 --> 00:57:48.300
ordinarily called 0.

00:57:48.300 --> 00:57:52.040
In an additive group it's
always called 0.

00:57:52.040 --> 00:57:53.270
So I'll call it 0.

00:57:53.270 --> 00:57:57.930
In more abstract treatments,
it's called 1 or E for --

00:57:57.930 --> 00:57:59.590
what does E stand for?

00:57:59.590 --> 00:58:01.990
Eigen something.

00:58:01.990 --> 00:58:10.020
There's a 0 in g such that
0 plus a equals --

00:58:10.020 --> 00:58:12.640
or a plus 0 --

00:58:12.640 --> 00:58:14.660
is always equal to a.

00:58:14.660 --> 00:58:19.382
The 0 is the null operator on
any element of the group.

00:58:19.382 --> 00:58:23.140
If you add 0 to anything, you
get what you started with.

00:58:26.890 --> 00:58:31.330
Clearly, we have such a thing
in ordinary addition.

00:58:31.330 --> 00:58:34.470
Suppose I was talking in
the real numbers under

00:58:34.470 --> 00:58:38.320
multiplication, is that
a group, you guess?

00:58:42.875 --> 00:58:46.380
It's actually not.

00:58:46.380 --> 00:58:48.860
Suppose I talk about the
non-zero real numbers under

00:58:48.860 --> 00:58:49.600
multiplication.

00:58:49.600 --> 00:58:50.850
Is that a group?

00:58:53.860 --> 00:58:57.700
Yes, and its identity is 1.

00:58:57.700 --> 00:59:01.680
1 as the thing that if you
multiply it by anything, it

00:59:01.680 --> 00:59:04.810
leaves what you started with.

00:59:04.810 --> 00:59:09.540
There's the inverse, which we
don't have in the reals under

00:59:09.540 --> 00:59:12.190
multiplication.

00:59:12.190 --> 00:59:21.620
For all a and g, there exists
something called minus a --

00:59:21.620 --> 00:59:25.700
or a to the minus 1 in
multiplicative notation --

00:59:25.700 --> 00:59:37.034
in g such that a plus
minus a equals 0.

00:59:37.034 --> 00:59:40.260
That's an additive inverse.

00:59:40.260 --> 00:59:45.636
So in the real numbers, the
inverse of a is minus a.

00:59:45.636 --> 00:59:47.740
In the integers, the
inverse of a is

00:59:47.740 --> 00:59:49.660
minus a under addition.

00:59:49.660 --> 00:59:54.900
In the non-zero real numbers
under multiplication, every

00:59:54.900 --> 00:59:59.510
non-zero real number does have
a multiplicative inverse,

00:59:59.510 --> 01:00:04.410
which is called 1 over
a, or a minus 1.

01:00:04.410 --> 01:00:05.990
That's why we have
to exclude 0.

01:00:05.990 --> 01:00:07.405
0 does not an inverse.

01:00:10.850 --> 01:00:16.740
So a good example to think
about is r-star, which is

01:00:16.740 --> 01:00:28.310
non-zero reals under ordinary
multiplication, is a group.

01:00:28.310 --> 01:00:31.740
Is it an abelian group?

01:00:31.740 --> 01:00:34.746
Is ab equal to ba?

01:00:34.746 --> 01:00:35.170
Yeah.

01:00:35.170 --> 01:00:37.866
So this is an infinite
abelian group.

01:00:53.878 --> 01:00:56.900
All right.

01:00:56.900 --> 01:00:59.755
OK.

01:00:59.755 --> 01:01:05.440
I want to show that
the axioms lead to

01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:07.465
a permutation property.

01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:17.470
Because this is something
that's going to come

01:01:17.470 --> 01:01:18.720
up again and again.

01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:28.430
One way of saying this is if I
have, if a plus b equals c --

01:01:28.430 --> 01:01:32.030
suppose I write down that
symbolic equation --

01:01:32.030 --> 01:01:45.670
then I can solve for any
one of the three

01:01:45.670 --> 01:01:46.920
given the other two.

01:01:51.686 --> 01:01:52.970
How would I do that?

01:01:52.970 --> 01:01:55.510
If I'm given a and b, obviously,
that tells me c

01:01:55.510 --> 01:01:56.230
from the table.

01:01:56.230 --> 01:02:01.890
If I'm given a and c, then a
is equal to c minus b --

01:02:01.890 --> 01:02:04.660
I'm sorry -- b is equal
to c minus a.

01:02:07.410 --> 01:02:11.360
I should say here, from this
inverse, we're going to write

01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:17.730
b plus minus a in
a simpler form.

01:02:17.730 --> 01:02:19.300
It's just b minus a.

01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:24.700
So the fact that we have an
inverse sort of defines

01:02:24.700 --> 01:02:30.590
another operation, which
we call subtraction,

01:02:30.590 --> 01:02:32.825
which is not abelian.

01:02:32.825 --> 01:02:33.770
Not commutative.

01:02:33.770 --> 01:02:37.660
a minus b is not equal
to b minus a.

01:02:37.660 --> 01:02:40.420
But it's basically implicit
in this that we

01:02:40.420 --> 01:02:42.100
subtract group elements.

01:02:42.100 --> 01:02:43.760
We can cancel group elements.

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:46.990
If you have a plus c equal
to b plus c, then a

01:02:46.990 --> 01:02:48.030
must be equal to b.

01:02:48.030 --> 01:02:50.455
Because you can subtract
c from both sides.

01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:56.386
All right.

01:02:56.386 --> 01:02:57.636
OK.

01:03:01.940 --> 01:03:10.130
What does this mean that this
gives us a constraint on the

01:03:10.130 --> 01:03:11.430
addition table of a group?

01:03:11.430 --> 01:03:22.280
Suppose I take a four element
group, g, and one of the

01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:25.640
elements is going to be the zero
element, and the other

01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:27.980
let's just call a, b, c.

01:03:27.980 --> 01:03:31.220
0, a, b, c.

01:03:31.220 --> 01:03:34.000
And I have a well-defined
addition table, which

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:38.290
includes, in here, only
a 0, a, b, c.

01:03:38.290 --> 01:03:42.250
From the property of the
identity, I can fill in some

01:03:42.250 --> 01:03:43.500
of these things.

01:03:47.190 --> 01:03:50.210
And now what freedom do I have
to fill in the rest?

01:03:50.210 --> 01:03:52.780
How many group tables are
there of size four?

01:03:58.490 --> 01:04:05.490
Well, the main point that I want
to make with permutation

01:04:05.490 --> 01:04:09.860
property is that every row and
every column has to be a

01:04:09.860 --> 01:04:12.570
permutation of the four
elements 0, a, b, c.

01:04:15.340 --> 01:04:16.630
Why is that?

01:04:16.630 --> 01:04:22.980
Suppose I had another a
in this column here.

01:04:22.980 --> 01:04:27.670
Then I would have a plus 0 is
equal to a, and also a plus c

01:04:27.670 --> 01:04:30.210
is equal to a.

01:04:30.210 --> 01:04:35.840
But that would imply that c
equals 0, which it isn't.

01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:36.026
All right.

01:04:36.026 --> 01:04:40.370
So in order to be able to solve
this equation, this has

01:04:40.370 --> 01:04:44.850
to be something different
from a, and likewise.

01:04:44.850 --> 01:04:48.950
Since I have, in this case, a
finite group, I basically just

01:04:48.950 --> 01:04:51.990
have to write the group elements
down here again in

01:04:51.990 --> 01:04:53.240
some order.

01:04:55.480 --> 01:04:58.780
It tuRns out that for four
elements, there are exactly

01:04:58.780 --> 01:05:04.170
two ways of doing that,
generically.

01:05:04.170 --> 01:05:07.860
One is sort of the
cyclic group.

01:05:07.860 --> 01:05:09.070
I'm sorry --

01:05:09.070 --> 01:05:16.690
a, b, c, 0, a, c, 0, a, b.

01:05:16.690 --> 01:05:21.810
That's one way of filling out
the table such that each row

01:05:21.810 --> 01:05:24.750
is a permutation
of 0, a, b, c.

01:05:24.750 --> 01:05:28.060
Each column is a permutation
of 0, a, b, c.

01:05:28.060 --> 01:05:31.860
So that's a legitimate
group table.

01:05:31.860 --> 01:05:34.920
Let me just, for your interest,
show you that that's

01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:38.120
not the only one.

01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:42.950
We could also do 0, a,
b, c, 0, a, b, c.

01:05:42.950 --> 01:05:45.290
If I write 0 here, then
I've got to write

01:05:45.290 --> 01:05:47.480
c there and b there.

01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:51.790
Got to write c here
and b there.

01:05:51.790 --> 01:05:57.350
And then down here, the only
choice I have is this.

01:05:57.350 --> 01:06:02.400
This is called the cyclic
group of four elements.

01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:05.880
This is called the
Klein four group.

01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:07.500
And this is all there is.

01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:11.830
Both of them tuRn out to be
abelian if you check it out.

01:06:11.830 --> 01:06:16.780
And basically, this permutation
property restricts

01:06:16.780 --> 01:06:20.930
these to be the possible groups
of size four, abelian

01:06:20.930 --> 01:06:23.800
or non-abelian, just to
satisfy the axiom.

01:06:28.270 --> 01:06:33.840
I actually prove in the notes
that if you replace axioms a

01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:43.020
and b with the permutation
property, you get another

01:06:43.020 --> 01:06:50.830
equivalent set of axioms
for a group.

01:06:50.830 --> 01:06:57.340
So the permutation of properties
is very basic.

01:06:57.340 --> 01:06:59.280
All you need is --

01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:03.070
for a set and a binary operation
to form a group, all

01:07:03.070 --> 01:07:06.600
you need is identity,
associativity, and the

01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:10.800
permutation property for
the group table,

01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:13.740
the addition table.

01:07:13.740 --> 01:07:15.600
Simple proof of that
in the notes.

01:07:18.190 --> 01:07:22.050
But this observation
is going to be

01:07:22.050 --> 01:07:24.720
important as we go forward.

01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:27.310
It's a fundamental thing
we're going to use.

01:07:27.310 --> 01:07:29.720
So you see a group can't
just be anything.

01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:33.610
It already has very definite
restrictions on it.

01:07:38.053 --> 01:07:38.840
All right.

01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:43.144
Anything else I want
to say right here?

01:07:43.144 --> 01:07:45.026
OK, subtraction, cancellation.

01:07:48.210 --> 01:08:01.400
OK, I guess we can go into
the next property,

01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:03.980
which is cyclic groups.

01:08:03.980 --> 01:08:09.830
And I'm only going to talk about
finite cyclic groups, or

01:08:09.830 --> 01:08:12.090
finite groups in general.

01:08:12.090 --> 01:08:14.640
Now, a cyclic group
is probably the

01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:15.890
simplest kind of group.

01:08:22.140 --> 01:08:38.590
Let me first put up the
canonical cyclic group, which

01:08:38.590 --> 01:08:52.910
is the integers mod-n, which
means the set of residues

01:08:52.910 --> 01:08:56.854
mod-n and the mod-n addition
operation.

01:09:00.439 --> 01:09:05.120
Which is written just as Zn --

01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:07.029
there are various notations
for it.

01:09:07.029 --> 01:09:13.029
But this, of course, we'll
just write it as Zn.

01:09:13.029 --> 01:09:14.279
The integers mod-n.

01:09:17.109 --> 01:09:20.350
Does this form a group?

01:09:20.350 --> 01:09:21.835
Let's check the axioms.

01:09:25.350 --> 01:09:29.439
Certainly, let's take
the original axioms.

01:09:29.439 --> 01:09:33.060
So the Rn is closed under
addition mod-n.

01:09:33.060 --> 01:09:37.830
If we add two elements, we're
going to get another element.

01:09:37.830 --> 01:09:40.325
The mod-n addition operation
is associative.

01:09:40.325 --> 01:09:42.560
In fact, it's abelian.

01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:45.510
a plus b plus c is b plus c plus
a -- it doesn't matter

01:09:45.510 --> 01:09:47.310
what order, from the
same property

01:09:47.310 --> 01:09:49.510
for ordinary addition.

01:09:49.510 --> 01:09:51.970
Is there an identity in here?

01:09:51.970 --> 01:09:52.930
Yes.

01:09:52.930 --> 01:09:56.630
The 0 is one of the elements
here and acts as the identity.

01:09:56.630 --> 01:10:01.120
0 plus anything mod-n is equal
to the same thing mod-n.

01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:04.660
And is there an inverse?

01:10:04.660 --> 01:10:05.910
OK.

01:10:08.430 --> 01:10:15.155
Let's explicitly write out Rn
as 0, 1 up to n minus 1.

01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:26.080
And then I claim that if I take
any of these i, then n

01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:29.130
minus i is its inverse.

01:10:29.130 --> 01:10:35.270
n minus i is in the right
range if not zero.

01:10:35.270 --> 01:10:36.770
The inverse of 0 is 0.

01:10:36.770 --> 01:10:41.800
The inverse of i between 1 and
n minus 1 is going to be n

01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:46.270
minus i because if I add
i to n minus i --

01:10:46.270 --> 01:10:49.730
is equal to n, take mod-n,
that's equal to 0.

01:10:49.730 --> 01:10:55.050
So every element has the
additive inverse.

01:10:55.050 --> 01:11:01.460
And so the group table has a
very boring form, which does

01:11:01.460 --> 01:11:04.080
satisfy the permutation
property.

01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:06.910
If I take Z5, for instance.

01:11:09.620 --> 01:11:09.845
0,1,2,3,4.

01:11:09.845 --> 01:11:11.860
0 plus anything looks
like that.

01:11:11.860 --> 01:11:16.250
1 times anything is
just 1,2,3,4 and 1

01:11:16.250 --> 01:11:19.030
plus 4 is 0 mod 5.

01:11:19.030 --> 01:11:31.400
2,3,4,0,1, and so forth.

01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:31.650
3, 4, 0, 1, 2, 4, 0, 1, 2, 3.

01:11:31.650 --> 01:11:35.930
Each row or column is just a
cyclic shift to the previous

01:11:35.930 --> 01:11:36.455
row or column.

01:11:36.455 --> 01:11:37.770
Just fill it out.

01:11:37.770 --> 01:11:40.400
And does it satisfy the
permutation property?

01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:43.070
Yes, it does.

01:11:43.070 --> 01:11:49.400
This one here, for instance, you
can recognize as a cyclic

01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:50.360
group table.

01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:55.930
And so, apart from relabeling,
this is the group table of Z4.

01:11:55.930 --> 01:12:01.840
Or we take a, b, c
equal to 1, 2, 3.

01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:06.050
If two groups have the same
group table up to relabelling,

01:12:06.050 --> 01:12:08.720
they're said to be isomorphic.

01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:09.460
OK?

01:12:09.460 --> 01:12:12.610
That's an important
concept in math.

01:12:12.610 --> 01:12:16.680
And all it means is the two
groups act the same, except

01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:18.840
that we've changed the names
of the group elements.

01:12:23.690 --> 01:12:25.580
OK.

01:12:25.580 --> 01:12:31.710
So what I'm going to show
is that all cyclic --

01:12:31.710 --> 01:12:37.020
this group is sort of cyclic
because, as you see in the

01:12:37.020 --> 01:12:42.830
notes, we can think of adding
1 as just being

01:12:42.830 --> 01:12:45.200
cycling around a circle.

01:12:48.140 --> 01:12:51.130
In this case, with
5 points on it.

01:12:51.130 --> 01:12:55.280
And adding 2 is going two
steps around the circle.

01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:57.880
And the elements on the
circle are the group

01:12:57.880 --> 01:12:59.130
elements 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.

01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:04.620
And then we get to 5.

01:13:04.620 --> 01:13:06.860
We identify that with 0.

01:13:06.860 --> 01:13:08.140
So we close the loop.

01:13:08.140 --> 01:13:10.600
One we identify with 6.

01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:11.645
This with 7.

01:13:11.645 --> 01:13:13.270
This with 8.

01:13:13.270 --> 01:13:14.890
Up to as many as you like.

01:13:14.890 --> 01:13:17.500
So that's the intuition
why these are

01:13:17.500 --> 01:13:19.000
called cyclic groups.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:24.640
The addition operation cycles
rather than being on a line,

01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:26.760
as it would be with the ordinary
integers, where we go

01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:28.530
infinitely in either
direction.

01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:49.150
So the formal definition of a
cyclic group is that g has a

01:13:49.150 --> 01:13:50.400
single generator.

01:14:02.570 --> 01:14:06.250
Call it a little g.

01:14:06.250 --> 01:14:09.120
And -- am I running over?

01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:11.850
Close to.

01:14:11.850 --> 01:14:12.530
Is that really right?

01:14:12.530 --> 01:14:14.480
I only have five minutes left.

01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:18.700
We're not going to go at
the speed I had hoped.

01:14:18.700 --> 01:14:19.810
g is --

01:14:19.810 --> 01:14:21.680
what does that mean?

01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:26.210
If we know that g contains g,
and this is never going to be

01:14:26.210 --> 01:14:30.740
equal to 0, then we know that
g contains two elements at

01:14:30.740 --> 01:14:33.480
least: 0 and g.

01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:45.090
And by the group axioms, g
contains g, g plus g, g

01:14:45.090 --> 01:14:46.970
plus g plus g --

01:14:46.970 --> 01:14:49.140
we can keep adding them.

01:14:49.140 --> 01:14:53.340
I'm going to call these the
integer multiples of g.

01:14:53.340 --> 01:14:58.940
So this will be 1g, 2g, 3g.

01:14:58.940 --> 01:15:00.800
That's what I mean when
I write an integer

01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:01.580
in front of g --

01:15:01.580 --> 01:15:06.560
I mean g plus itself, the
integer number of times.

01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:09.020
And all those things, by the
group properties, have to be

01:15:09.020 --> 01:15:11.430
in the group.

01:15:11.430 --> 01:15:12.680
All right?

01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:17.242
Again, restrict this
to finite.

01:15:17.242 --> 01:15:18.985
It's a finite cyclic group.

01:15:22.150 --> 01:15:24.960
Then at some point,
I have to --

01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:26.610
this is all the elements
of the group.

01:15:29.300 --> 01:15:31.500
So at some point, I have
to come along and

01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:36.220
say that ng is 0.

01:15:36.220 --> 01:15:37.760
If just by --

01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:41.570
when I say generator, the
set generated by g is

01:15:41.570 --> 01:15:44.110
just 1g, 2g, 3g.

01:15:44.110 --> 01:15:46.190
And that's got to be all the
elements of the group, so n

01:15:46.190 --> 01:15:47.780
times g has got to be 0.

01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:59.130
And that means, without putting
too fine a point on

01:15:59.130 --> 01:16:03.400
it, that if n were 5, for
instance, the group has to

01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:11.720
consist of 0g, 1g, 2g, 3g, 4g,
and then 5g is equal to 0.

01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:14.860
So we call this 0g or 5g.

01:16:17.820 --> 01:16:22.976
And furthermore, the addition
table of the group, we can,

01:16:22.976 --> 01:16:24.380
you know --

01:16:24.380 --> 01:16:28.380
however, if we add 2 g's to 3
g's, we're going to 5 g's,

01:16:28.380 --> 01:16:29.920
which is 0.

01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:30.340
All right?

01:16:30.340 --> 01:16:35.150
So 2g plus 3g has got to
be 5 g's, which is 0g.

01:16:37.783 --> 01:16:41.570
So this is what the addition
table of the

01:16:41.570 --> 01:16:44.400
group has to look like.

01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:47.510
It's exactly the same, except
we just make a one-to-one

01:16:47.510 --> 01:16:53.640
correspondence like that.

01:16:53.640 --> 01:17:11.250
So the conclusion is a
finite cyclic group

01:17:11.250 --> 01:17:15.420
with n elements --

01:17:15.420 --> 01:17:18.425
I'll write the size of g by this
absolute value thing --

01:17:24.020 --> 01:17:31.770
is isomorphic to the
integers mod-n --

01:17:31.770 --> 01:17:35.260
this canonical cyclic group
that we started with --

01:17:35.260 --> 01:17:43.340
must be isomorphic to Zn with
the isomorphism being given by

01:17:43.340 --> 01:17:44.633
the one-to-one correspondence.

01:17:53.090 --> 01:18:03.140
i_g in the group corresponds
to simply i in Zn, or 0 is

01:18:03.140 --> 01:18:06.120
less than or equal to
i is less than or

01:18:06.120 --> 01:18:07.530
equal to n minus 1.

01:18:10.390 --> 01:18:14.230
The addition rule is
exactly the same.

01:18:14.230 --> 01:18:18.920
OK, so this is a pretty
sweeping conclusion.

01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:22.330
It says that really the only
finite cyclic group up to

01:18:22.330 --> 01:18:25.990
relabeling is Zn.

01:18:25.990 --> 01:18:28.560
OK, so if you understand Zn,
you understand all finite

01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:30.120
cyclic groups.

01:18:30.120 --> 01:18:34.120
Just in a general group, we're
going to have some element

01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:38.490
which basically represents 1,
called g, and its integer

01:18:38.490 --> 01:18:43.470
multiples, which represent
2, 3, 4, and so forth.

01:18:43.470 --> 01:18:47.650
But we can operate with
a group just as

01:18:47.650 --> 01:18:50.140
though it was Zn.

01:18:50.140 --> 01:18:53.400
So it's easy to understand
finite cyclic groups.

01:18:53.400 --> 01:18:56.470
They all just look like this.

01:18:56.470 --> 01:18:57.070
Question?

01:18:57.070 --> 01:18:57.430
Yeah.

01:18:57.430 --> 01:19:00.930
AUDIENCE: Is the generator
unique?

01:19:00.930 --> 01:19:03.955
PROFESSOR: No, it's not.

01:19:03.955 --> 01:19:06.380
No, it's not.

01:19:06.380 --> 01:19:08.950
Next time we'll start
to talk about

01:19:08.950 --> 01:19:12.370
subgroups of Zn, for instance.

01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:21.690
In the set of Z5 --

01:19:21.690 --> 01:19:24.720
well, let me take this.

01:19:24.720 --> 01:19:26.310
All right.

01:19:26.310 --> 01:19:27.610
In Z5 --

01:19:27.610 --> 01:19:28.960
let me not even do that.

01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:35.160
In Z5, 1 is the generator, but
because 5 is a prime, 2 is a

01:19:35.160 --> 01:19:36.880
generator, too.

01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:38.770
All right?

01:19:38.770 --> 01:19:40.610
Another way of writing.

01:19:40.610 --> 01:19:45.305
Let's take a generator
equals 2 in Z5.

01:19:45.305 --> 01:19:50.370
Then g equals 2, 2g equals 4.

01:19:50.370 --> 01:19:53.820
3g equals 6, equals 1 mod-5.

01:19:53.820 --> 01:19:56.360
4g equals 3.

01:19:56.360 --> 01:20:01.950
And 5g, of course, equals
5, which equals zero.

01:20:01.950 --> 01:20:04.610
So 2 is also a generator.

01:20:04.610 --> 01:20:07.990
And, in fact, 3 and 4
are also generators.

01:20:07.990 --> 01:20:09.160
There are four generators.

01:20:09.160 --> 01:20:11.340
This is getting us right
into the number theory.

01:20:13.940 --> 01:20:14.230
OK.

01:20:14.230 --> 01:20:18.780
So no, g does not
have to be 1.

01:20:18.780 --> 01:20:21.870
g is just something that if
you take all its integer

01:20:21.870 --> 01:20:25.870
multiples, you generate
the group.

01:20:25.870 --> 01:20:31.630
OK, I guess we stop there, and
we'll resume next time.
