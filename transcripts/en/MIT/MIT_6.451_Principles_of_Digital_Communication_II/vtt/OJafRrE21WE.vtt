00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.196
PROFESSOR: All right, I
thought he would be.

00:00:01.196 --> 00:00:04.200
It's always a hazard putting
up somebody who you know is

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.200
going to lecture better
than you do.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.080
But I hope that was a
good change of pace.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.070
And, of course, he knows more
about the subject of

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.660
Reed-Solomon decoding than I
or more than practically

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.860
anyone else does, so --

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.130
did he have much time to
talk about decoding or

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:22.730
was the most -- yeah.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.190
Talked about the decoding
algorithms, Sudan-type

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:26.762
decoding algorithms.

00:00:26.762 --> 00:00:28.180
Yeah?

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:29.070
OK.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:29.850
Good.

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.650
Well, in fact, he covered so
much that I don't have much

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:34.000
left to do today.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.280
I remind you, Ashish
put out an email.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.960
There's a review session
tomorrow for the midterm from

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.760
5 to 7 in a different
room, 36-112.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.460
The midterm is Wednesday
in this room.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.180
It starts at 9:05 to give
you a little bit more

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.400
time to work on it.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.880
It's closed book except that
you're allowed to make up

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.280
three normal size
sheets of notes.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.830
You can write as small
as you like.

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.920
This experience has shown this
is the very best way of

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.380
getting you to consolidate what
you've learned up to this

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.920
point, is writing your own
three-page precis of the

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.090
course to date.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.115
So, yes?

00:01:24.115 --> 00:01:26.352
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:01:26.352 --> 00:01:27.680
PROFESSOR: What is
the rule, both --

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:28.596
what?

00:01:28.596 --> 00:01:29.970
AUDIENCE: Both sides.

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:30.950
PROFESSOR: Both sides.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.070
All right.

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.746
Six sheets.

00:01:33.746 --> 00:01:36.640
If you can't write down the
whole course in six sheets,

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.520
then, well, you haven't
been paying attention.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.030
OK.

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.880
And you can bring calculators,
but we don't

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.110
expect they'll be useful.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.940
Please erase any erasable will
memories if you do bring

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.320
calculators.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.190
These are things we tell
undergraduates.

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.390
I guess they hardly
seem necessary

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.070
in a graduate course.

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.500
Any other questions about the
logistics of the midterm?

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.738
AUDIENCE: What is the material
going to be for the midterm?

00:02:10.738 --> 00:02:14.820
PROFESSOR: Everything that's
been covered up to today.

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.440
I won't hold you responsible
for anything I've

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.760
talked about today.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.750
So it's basically chapters
one through eight.

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.510
I really will only hold you
responsible for what we

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.790
covered in class, which chapters
one, two, and three

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.760
were so brief, you can't say
we really covered them.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.703
So really, chapters four
through eight.

00:02:42.633 --> 00:02:45.560
Any other questions?

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:46.040
All right.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.160
You'll have more chance
as we go along.

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:59.210
So as I say, Ralf really covered
the main things about

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:05.240
Reed-Solomon codes, which are
the crowning achievement of

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.480
algebraic coding theory.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.180
They have a lot of favorable
attributes.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:20.280
They are optimum, from an n,
k, d point of view, in the

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:26.500
sense that they're maximum
distance separable.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.520
The parameters are as good as
they possibly could be by this

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.360
very basic Singleton bound.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.320
They have efficient algebraic
decoding algorithms.

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:48.170
And traditionally, this has
meant hard decision bounded

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.030
distance decoding algorithms
like the Welch-Berlekamp

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.750
algorithm or the
Berlekamp-Massey match

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:59.390
algorithm, which take hard
decisions in, put hard

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.360
decisions on symbols out.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.210
But as Ralf suggested to you,
now there are algorithms that

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:11.800
can use soft decisions in,
produce a list, at least,

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.880
coming out, some indication
of the reliability of each

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.980
element of the list.

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.410
So they've been softened up.

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:29.480
Nonetheless, what are the
negatives is, basically, that

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:36.760
they work on bytes, or
symbols, not bits.

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:44.080
So if we have a basically binary
channel, as we very

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:50.970
frequently do, then they need
something else to make them

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.920
adapted to the binary channel,
or even on the additive white

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.060
Gaussian noise channel.

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.740
I don't think we've gone through
the calculation.

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:07.100
You could think of sending q or
e symbols over the additive

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.240
white Gaussian noise channel,
but what would you need?

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.490
You would need a q
or e signal set.

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:17.430
Now, if you pick that to be a
q simplex signals set or a

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.040
orthogonal or biorthogonal
signal set, then that might

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.530
work because the distance
structure of such a signal set

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:26.900
is like the Hamming distance
structure in GF of q.

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.960
In other words, it's
approximately equally likely

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.330
to make an error to
any other symbol.

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.910
The symbols are more or less
equally spread apart in

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:40.890
Euclidean space.

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:46.130
Just as when we count distance
in Hamming space, we give the

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:49.880
same weight to each possible
kind of error or each possible

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.610
kind of symbol difference.

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:56.820
So if you did that,
then Reed-Solomon

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:58.240
codes might work well.

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.670
That's one form of a
concatenated scheme, which I

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:04.290
will talk about in
just a second.

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:08.350
But if you tried to apply
Reed-Solomon codes to a binary

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:11.266
input additive white Gaussian
noise channel, just translate

00:06:11.266 --> 00:06:16.150
the, say, 8-bit bytes into bits
and send them one bit at

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:20.680
a time, then the distance
structures don't

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:21.840
correspond at all well.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.580
It's much more likely to make
a single bit error than an

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.270
error that involves all eight
bits or something.

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:33.700
And for that fundamental reason,
you'll find that

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:36.500
performance is not so great.

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:41.330
And certainly, this is not the
way to get to capacity all by

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:45.370
itself unless it's married
with something else.

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:48.590
So that's something we always
have to deal with in another

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:51.300
applications, as I will talk
about in a minute.

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:54.470
We naturally do want
to correct bytes,

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:57.210
or symbols, or blocks.

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:59.950
There are many bits.

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:03.770
And then Reed-Solomon codes are
just exactly what we want.

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:07.570
They're optimal in any
such situation.

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:09.280
And so what did I just say?

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:16.520
They're not the way to get to
capacity, although they are

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:21.930
sometimes part of schemes
for getting to capacity.

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:24.930
And since getting to capacity in
the additive white Gaussian

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:29.780
noise channel is the theme of
this course, then they play

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:33.440
only a peripheral role
in that theme.

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:35.750
Nonetheless, they're
great codes.

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:37.580
They're in wide use.

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:39.960
They're part of every
semiconductor manufacturer's

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:41.400
core library.

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:51.220
You can buy (255,223) distance
33, 16 error correcting

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:56.250
Reed-Solomon decoder in part of
any chip package and it'll

00:07:56.250 --> 00:08:00.260
go at gigabits nowadays.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:04.640
So it's kind of the all-purpose
error correcting

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:09.540
code, with the caveat that you
need to somehow get what you

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:15.320
correct to be bytes rather
than bits, OK?

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:23.200
So today I thought I'd cover the
last two topics in chapter

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:32.400
eight and maybe, to the extent
that time permits, go back to

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:35.106
chapter seven.

00:08:35.106 --> 00:08:39.530
But we'll see how we
feel about that.

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:41.719
Applications of Reed-Solomon
codes.

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:51.100
OK, basically, you can apply
them wherever you want to

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:58.690
correct blocks, rather than bits
or packets or n-tuples or

00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:00.990
what have you.

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:06.860
So one obvious application is,
when you send packets through

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:22.510
the internet, if you use
Reed-Solomon codes across the

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:30.820
packet, then you can correct
errors that occur in

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:33.020
individual packets.

00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:35.950
This is not the way the internet
usually works.

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:41.330
The internet usually works by
having an error detection code

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:45.930
within each packet, a cyclic
redundancy check (CRC).

00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:49.020
You hash bits, whatever.

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:54.170
You provide some redundant bits
within each packet if --

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:57.200
when you receive the packet, you
check to see whether the

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:59.130
parity check checks.

00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:05.400
If there are parity check bits,
then a very good rule of

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:10.210
thumb is that the probability of
not detecting an error for

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:12.820
almost any type of error pattern
is going to be of the

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:14.750
order of 2 to the minus r.

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:16.970
That's exactly what it would
be if you had a completely

00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:18.940
random stream of bits.

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:22.940
Random stream of bits with r
redundant bits in a block, the

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:25.990
probability that all the check
bits are random, the

00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:28.440
probability that they're
all equal to 0, is 2

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:29.940
to the minus r.

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:30.340
All right?

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:34.670
But it turns out that's very
good approximation for just

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:35.990
about any error mechanism.

00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:38.870
So you pick r large enough.

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:43.110
It's often been picked to be
something like r equals 32.

00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:47.320
What kind of failure to
detect does that give?

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:51.220
2 to the minus 32, which is
what, about 2 the minus 9th, 2

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:52.320
to the minus 10th --

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:56.190
10 to the minus 9th, 10
to the minus 10th.

00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:58.010
Is that low enough?

00:10:58.010 --> 00:10:59.100
It was certainly --

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:01.390
when I started in this business,
that was considered

00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:04.930
just incredibly low, but now
that we're sending mega

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:08.220
packets per second, it doesn't
seem quite so low anymore.

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:12.640
And so 32 is a little bit
on the sloppy side.

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:14.870
There are going to be undetected
errors that get

00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:17.100
through if you're spending
10 to the 9th,

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:19.710
10 to the 10th packets.

00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:26.900
But 32 or, nowadays, 64 would
be a better number.

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:30.390
Just like cryptography, the
number of bits has to go up as

00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:32.020
technology goes up.

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:34.400
But 32 is often used.

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:37.700
OK, but here's an alternative
scheme.

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:41.220
Suppose you coded
across packets.

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:48.720
So here is a, say, a
1,000-bit packet.

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:55.270
And here's packet one, here's
packet two, here's packet

00:11:55.270 --> 00:12:04.810
three, and so forth up to packet
k, where we're going to

00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:16.050
use n, k, d equals n minus k
plus 1, RS code over, it

00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:21.720
doesn't matter, GF of let's
say 256, just for definite

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:22.740
[INAUDIBLE].

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:25.270
Here I'm using older notation.

00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:28.140
This is the same as F-256.

00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:30.310
Or we sometimes write that
as F 2 to the 8th.

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:36.640
OK, how are we going to do
packet error correction?

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:41.420
We're going to code crosswise
in columns, all right?

00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:46.860
So these would be k.

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:48.540
Let's make this eight-wide.

00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:50.630
Just pick off a bite
at a time here.

00:12:50.630 --> 00:12:52.840
So each of these can be
considered to be a

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:56.500
symbol in GF of 256.

00:12:56.500 --> 00:13:01.060
And then we'll code n
minus k parity check

00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:04.370
packets down here.

00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:10.200
So these are redundant
check packets.

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:16.030
Encoded bytes at this point.

00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:17.220
They're not packets yet.

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:26.610
But if we do that column-wise
across here, we can fill in n

00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:42.160
minus k check packets and you
can see the block length is

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:44.310
quite huge here.

00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:48.840
So you might have a delay or
latency problem in executing

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:49.340
this scheme.

00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:54.530
Basically, you would have to
send this whole thing before

00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:57.130
you could do error correction
and then error correct the

00:13:57.130 --> 00:13:58.040
whole thing.

00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:00.450
But how does error
correction work?

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:01.230
You send this.

00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:05.740
Perhaps some of the packets are
erased or even received

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:07.230
incorrectly.

00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:10.760
You would then use some error
correction or erasure and

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:14.880
error correction scheme, which
Ralf talked about, for

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:18.610
correcting the Reed-Solomon
code.

00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:27.470
And you could correct up to d
over 2 errors, or up to d

00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:31.640
minus 1 erasures, OK?

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:35.560
So this would be a very
powerful packet error

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:36.470
correction scheme.

00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:37.500
What are its costs?

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:40.590
It's costs are quite a
bit of redundancy.

00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:45.270
It doesn't fit the internet
architecture very well.

00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:48.420
This is basically a
point-to-point scheme.

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:51.780
So when you're sending from a to
b, you'd have to send b an

00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:55.390
additional n minus k streams.

00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:58.660
And if you're sending the same
webpage, as you often do, to

00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:03.290
multiple people, you'd have
to send this to everybody.

00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:07.380
And it also doesn't have
any feedback in it.

00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:10.960
The great thing about ARQ is
that you only have to send the

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:12.720
information that's necessary.

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:15.650
You only have to restore
the packets that

00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:17.185
are actually lost.

00:15:17.185 --> 00:15:20.370
You send them again.

00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:23.520
Whereas here, you're just kind
of, a priori, deciding that

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:26.450
you're going to send a great
deal of redundant information

00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:30.380
down here to cover some kind
of worst case, whatever you

00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:33.320
think the worst-case number
of packets would be.

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:35.430
If there are more that
worst-case number or packets,

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:37.880
then you could retransmit
again, but you're

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:40.730
retransmitting this huge
block, all right?

00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:45.230
So for that reason, this is not
actually used, as far as

00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:46.840
I'm aware, in the internet.

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:49.400
ARQ, wherever you have
a feedback path,

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:52.460
you should use it.

00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:55.280
That's a general moral.

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:59.540
So ARQ is a wonderful scheme
that is, on an erasure

00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:03.810
channel, that's a
capacity-approaching scheme.

00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:06.490
Just on a bitwise basis, if
you have a binary erasure

00:16:06.490 --> 00:16:11.410
channel with erasure probability
p, and then the

00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:15.140
capacity of the channel is 1
minus p, and you can reach

00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:18.010
that capacity if you simply
retransmit each

00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:18.970
bit that was erased.

00:16:18.970 --> 00:16:20.530
As it's erased --

00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:22.300
it's erased, you
send it again.

00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:25.100
And a quick calculation shows
you that the average number of

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:26.960
retransmissions is p.

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:31.660
And so the average reduction
from 1 bit per second is --

00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:35.260
1 bit per transmission is p bits
per transmission, you can

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:38.240
achieve 1 minus p with no
coding at all, just by

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:39.890
retransmission.

00:16:39.890 --> 00:16:41.990
So it's perfectly matched
to the erasure channel.

00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:47.250
And the internet, especially
with parity checks, CRC,

00:16:47.250 --> 00:16:52.980
within blocks, long enough
CRC is basically a

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:56.250
packet erasure channel.

00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:59.630
You really, in practice,
hardly ever make

00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:01.500
a undetected --

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:05.920
let a packet with errors
come through.

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:07.530
OK?

00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:08.750
Any questions about this?

00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:12.519
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:12.519 --> 00:17:18.530
PROFESSOR: The TCP/IP protocol
just has a 32-bit CRC, I

00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:22.310
think, and if it fails to check,
you ask for that packet

00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:23.604
again by packet number.

00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:30.090
OK?

00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:34.040
So Reed-Solomon codes, of
course, are optimal if that's

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:35.040
what you want to do.

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:38.000
You couldn't possibly have
a better code for

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.890
coding across packets.

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:42.550
But it's cumbersome in the
packet environment.

00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:47.110
OK.

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:54.060
Let's talk about concatenated
codes.

00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:55.310
I guess I'll do it at
the same place.

00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:15.800
This is something --

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:24.530
I did in my thesis and last
week I was at a tribute to

00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:27.230
Andy Viterbi, who invented
the Viterbi

00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:29.310
algorithm, among other things.

00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:32.850
Of course, everybody knows that
the Viterbi algorithm,

00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:36.300
when Andy invented it, he had no
idea it was actually going

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:37.960
to be a practical algorithm.

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:40.060
It's become one of the super
practical algorithms.

00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:43.200
He was just trying to prove a
certain result, exponential

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:45.600
error bounds for convolutional
codes.

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:48.300
And he thought the proof was
easier to understand if you

00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:54.240
introduce this algorithm, which
he describes perfectly.

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:55.590
It is the Viterbi algorithm.

00:18:55.590 --> 00:19:00.150
But really, just a
proof technique.

00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:05.140
Didn't even realize it was
an optimum decoder.

00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:09.200
And then somebody, not him, not
me, but in his company,

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:11.720
fortunately, realized
that gee, this

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:13.330
could be very practical.

00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:16.620
And that became a workhorse
decoding algorithm.

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:21.700
Very similarly, concatenated
codes are something that I did

00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:24.450
in my thesis in 1965.

00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:28.880
And I was looking, basically,
for a theoretical result.

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:35.060
How could you approach capacity
with an exponentially

00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:39.380
decreasing error probability
near capacity but with only

00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:42.010
polynomial increasing
complexity?

00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:48.610
And I looked into this very
simple idea of basically

00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:51.670
taking two codes and using
one to correct the

00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:52.630
errors of the other.

00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:54.590
And I found that you
could do that.

00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:59.310
And I'd also never realized
that this

00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:00.580
might actually be practical.

00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:04.280
I remember going around giving
talks when I was interviewing

00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:07.580
afterwards that I was looking
for an industrial position.

00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:11.730
I went down to places like Bell
Labs, IBM labs, and did

00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:16.520
seminars talking about codes
that were thousands of symbols

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:19.290
long and everybody rolled their
eyes and said, boy, this

00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:22.320
guy is not very practical.

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:26.530
And to my surprise and everyone
else's surprise, this

00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:32.990
became and still is a very
practical way of getting

00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:34.460
high-performance codes.

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:36.610
This, in conjunction --

00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:41.450
well, I'll get into it, but this
was, again, a workhorse

00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:47.730
coding technique and still
is in wide use.

00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:53.060
In fact, as you will see, this
contains some of the ideas

00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:58.650
that go into modern
capacity-approaching codes.

00:20:58.650 --> 00:21:01.100
But the idea is very simple.

00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:10.730
You can do it two ways, or
probably many more than two.

00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:14.035
Suppose we have a basically
binary channel.

00:21:17.910 --> 00:21:21.340
I'll just say a core physical
channel there.

00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:25.200
The channel is what you can't
affect as an engineer.

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:29.030
So let's say we have a binary
symmetric channel or a binary

00:21:29.030 --> 00:21:32.530
input additive white Gaussian
noise channel or

00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:33.310
whatever you like.

00:21:33.310 --> 00:21:48.140
And then we could put on it an
encoder and decoder for an n,

00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:52.506
k, d binary linear block code.

00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:58.740
OK?

00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:03.490
Now, from the input and the
output, what is this channel

00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:04.740
going to look like?

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:09.220
At the input, we're putting --

00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:12.780
basically, per block,
we put k bits in.

00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:15.390
They're encoded into n bits.

00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:21.860
They're sent over the channel,
received some n-tuple of noisy

00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:23.250
received symbols.

00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:26.480
The decoder tries to find
the best code word.

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:28.755
The code word is identified
by k bits.

00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:36.370
Most of the time there'll
be no error and these --

00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:41.520
let's call this u in
and u hat out.

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:45.240
u hat is going to equal u.

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:48.150
But, of course, let's
imagine this is a

00:22:48.150 --> 00:22:49.790
relatively short code.

00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:53.380
Let's imagine this is a maximum
likelihood decoder or

00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:57.800
minimum distance decoder in
the appropriate space.

00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:01.070
Then the complexity is
going to be of the

00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:03.890
order of 2 to the k.

00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:07.080
And so you can't let
k get very big.

00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:09.180
We'll find somewhat
better ways to do

00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:10.900
maximum likelihood decoding.

00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:13.050
But if you're really trying to
do optimum decoding, the

00:23:13.050 --> 00:23:16.080
complexity is going to go up
exponentially at this stage

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:18.350
with the number of information
bits k.

00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:21.440
So this is not the scheme that
we're looking for that has

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:23.940
only polynomial complexity.

00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:27.140
We know that we can choose
codes like this that with

00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:29.700
optimum decoding get
to capacity.

00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:32.350
That's Shannon's theorem.

00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:36.040
But we don't know how to decode
them with reasonable

00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:37.950
complexity.

00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:39.320
But, all right, here's
a start.

00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:43.910
We could use a relatively modest
length code that we can

00:23:43.910 --> 00:23:45.480
feasibly decode.

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:48.470
And this is what we get.

00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:49.740
OK.

00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:52.240
So we have blocks going in.

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:55.920
Block from an alphabet
of size 2 to the k.

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:58.550
Blocks coming out, alphabet
size 2 to the k.

00:23:58.550 --> 00:24:01.710
Occasionally, we make errors.

00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:03.370
What's a good idea to then do?

00:24:06.150 --> 00:24:07.770
This is not very hard.

00:24:07.770 --> 00:24:09.870
This is why you should have been
in this field in the '60s

00:24:09.870 --> 00:24:12.870
rather than the year 2005.

00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:16.300
There were lots of good ideas
just laying around waiting to

00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:18.530
be picked up.

00:24:18.530 --> 00:24:19.020
Class?

00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:21.310
Anyone have a suggestion
for how to make further

00:24:21.310 --> 00:24:22.480
improvement in this system?

00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:24.168
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:24.168 --> 00:24:25.590
PROFESSOR: Add another code.

00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:28.690
What should it be?

00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:34.830
Let's put an encoder
here for what?

00:24:38.734 --> 00:24:41.662
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:41.662 --> 00:24:45.190
PROFESSOR: Everyone is
extremely wide awake.

00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:50.500
An n, k, d Reed-Solomon
code over what field?

00:24:55.670 --> 00:25:00.965
In principle, it should
be over F2 to the k.

00:25:00.965 --> 00:25:04.450
Now, of course, if k is 64 or
something here, you might not

00:25:04.450 --> 00:25:07.900
even go all the way to field
of 2 to the 64 elements.

00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:10.880
You might divide it up again as
we did in the packet error

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:11.380
correction.

00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:16.690
But basically, the way this goes
is you try to keep this

00:25:16.690 --> 00:25:19.770
as small as possible so that
this can still work.

00:25:19.770 --> 00:25:27.570
There's a tradeoff between the
complexity of the two codes

00:25:27.570 --> 00:25:29.672
and therefore, the rates.

00:25:29.672 --> 00:25:30.922
The decoder --

00:25:33.390 --> 00:25:44.160
here we have an algebraic
Reed-Solomon decoder, which,

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:48.660
in the simplest case, could
just do error correction.

00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:53.190
Just take these k bits as a hard
decision on u hat and try

00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:57.310
to correct any errors that
occurred in this inner loop

00:25:57.310 --> 00:26:00.700
here, which we might think
of this as being a

00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:02.110
2 to the kre channel.

00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:05.302
So this whole thing
together is a 2 to

00:26:05.302 --> 00:26:06.890
the kre super channel.

00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:15.020
Sorry if you can't read that,
but you heard me say it.

00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:19.740
So here's a channel that takes
in 2 to the kre symbols, puts

00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:25.900
out 2 to the kre symbols and
sometimes makes errors

00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:27.770
according to whatever the error
probability you can

00:26:27.770 --> 00:26:29.020
achieve here is.

00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:35.930
Or some of the discussion back
when we were talking about

00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:39.170
hard decision with binary
suggested that it would be

00:26:39.170 --> 00:26:43.980
better to pass along more
reliability information here

00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:45.660
along with just the
hard decision.

00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:54.600
And the very simplest kind of
reliability information is if

00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:59.950
this guy really isn't sure, if
either the noise is too large

00:26:59.950 --> 00:27:04.000
so he can't make any decision
or if the noise leaves him

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.980
exactly halfway between two
code words so it's a

00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:11.290
completely ambiguous decision,
or whatever criteria you have,

00:27:11.290 --> 00:27:13.600
this might make erasures.

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:16.730
And I'm sure Ralf told you how
to do error and erasure

00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:20.870
correction with Reed-Solomon
codes.

00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:25.320
Or this could be more likely
that information just --

00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:28.490
how likely was the code
word you actually saw?

00:27:28.490 --> 00:27:32.080
And there are various ways of
devising an approximate

00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:33.900
likelihood metric.

00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:37.030
You just do what makes sense
that indicates that some

00:27:37.030 --> 00:27:40.130
words, you're absolutely sure
of in this decoding.

00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:44.890
And other words, you
don't know --

00:27:44.890 --> 00:27:48.050
if you have one or more good
candidates or you have no good

00:27:48.050 --> 00:27:50.620
candidates.

00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:54.880
So based on this reliability
information, you can actually

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:55.990
incorporate that.

00:27:55.990 --> 00:27:58.580
Did Ralf talk about
reliability-based decoding?

00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:02.030
Soft decoding algorithms
for Reed-Solomon codes?

00:28:02.030 --> 00:28:02.710
No?

00:28:02.710 --> 00:28:05.950
OK, well, that's a shame because
he and Alex Vardy are

00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:10.250
the inventors of a very
good class that's

00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:11.760
recently been improved.

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:20.060
So one of the knocks on
Reed-Solomon codes is that, at

00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:25.670
one point, you might have said
a minus can only work with

00:28:25.670 --> 00:28:26.920
hard decisions.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.410
And then, fairly early,
it was figured out how

00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:33.970
to correct to erasures.

00:28:33.970 --> 00:28:39.320
But just in the last 10
years, we now have --

00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:40.420
this is no longer true.

00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:45.735
We can have soft, meaning
reliability-labeled inputs.

00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:58.890
And this is a plus.

00:28:58.890 --> 00:29:01.260
That means we can do soft --

00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:05.140
and we have corresponding
algorithms that can do soft

00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:07.080
Reed-Solomon decoding.

00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:09.770
They are, of course, more
complicated than just

00:29:09.770 --> 00:29:11.020
straightforward error

00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:13.720
correction with hard decisions.

00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:17.660
But there's still polynomial
complexity.

00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:25.660
They're maybe an order of
slightly higher degree of n,

00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:29.200
but still polynomial in the
block length or in k or d or

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:31.780
whatever you're taking.

00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:35.160
And so we now have some such
algorithms that do make

00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:37.240
substantial gains.

00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:41.350
And, of course, if he didn't
tell you about them, I'm not

00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:43.720
going to tell you about them.

00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:45.890
It's a rather specialized
subject.

00:29:45.890 --> 00:29:47.080
But it's something
that's really

00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:50.650
happened the last 10 years.

00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:52.500
And they've constantly
been improved.

00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:55.260
The first ones, like one
I came up with called

00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:59.560
generalized minimum distance
decoding, made a modest

00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:00.950
improvement.

00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:05.810
In dB terms, 1 dB, where
there's 3 dB to be got.

00:30:05.810 --> 00:30:10.360
Now they're up to 2, 2 1/2 out
of the 3 dB with these new

00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:14.160
soft Reed-Solomon decoding
algorithms.

00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:17.560
So anyway, if you pass some
reliability information here,

00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:20.775
then you can improve the
performance of this decoder.

00:30:20.775 --> 00:30:27.640
This decoder knows which symbols
are reliable and it

00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:31.610
won't change in the decoding
in which are unreliable or

00:30:31.610 --> 00:30:32.550
completely erased.

00:30:32.550 --> 00:30:34.470
Where there's no information
about them, that actually

00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:36.940
helps you in the decoding.

00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:43.670
If you knew that you had s
erasures rather than s errors,

00:30:43.670 --> 00:30:45.620
this helps you quite a lot.

00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:47.840
We can decode twice as
many erasures as

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:49.680
we can decode errors.

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:53.060
And similarly, soft information
in between can

00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:56.310
improve the capabilities
of your decoder.

00:30:56.310 --> 00:30:56.730
All right.

00:30:56.730 --> 00:31:01.620
So that's the set up.

00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:04.275
You can see why it makes a
certain amount of sense.

00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:10.360
From a complexity point of
view, what it does --

00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:12.680
here, we're going to do maximum
likelihood decoding,

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:14.760
complexity order
of 2 to the k.

00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:16.710
But we're not going
to let k get very

00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:18.690
large, so this is feasible.

00:31:18.690 --> 00:31:21.330
Then we're going to let the code
get very long, as we know

00:31:21.330 --> 00:31:23.480
we have to do from Shannon's
Theorem,

00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:26.020
using this outer code.

00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:29.840
But now we know we have
polynomial complexity

00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:33.340
Reed-Solomon decoding
algorithms, even for the soft

00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:34.600
decision case.

00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:42.330
So if we balance the complexity
here, basically let

00:31:42.330 --> 00:31:46.140
this length be exponential and
this length, as it is -- it's

00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:50.190
of the order of 2 to
the k itself --

00:31:50.190 --> 00:31:55.100
then we can get polynomial
complexity overall, all right?

00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:57.980
The overall complexity is going
to be of the order of a

00:31:57.980 --> 00:32:01.250
small power of 2 to the k.

00:32:01.250 --> 00:32:04.140
The overall block length is
going to be of the order --

00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:07.430
is going to be linear
in 2 to the k.

00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:10.300
And therefore, you're going
to get polynomial decoding

00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:11.620
complexity.

00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:14.510
The other question
is performance.

00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:19.770
And you can show
that if you --

00:32:19.770 --> 00:32:23.730
well, even if you don't use
reliability information, you

00:32:23.730 --> 00:32:27.360
can get all the way to the
capacity of this underlying

00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:31.860
channel here with
exponentially-decreasing error

00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:35.080
rate for any rate below
that capacity.

00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:40.530
Not as good an exponent as if
you just used random codes per

00:32:40.530 --> 00:32:44.740
Shannon and coded for the
channel, but nonetheless, you

00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:46.030
basically get what you want.

00:32:46.030 --> 00:32:53.310
So using two smaller, simpler
codes to create one long code

00:32:53.310 --> 00:32:55.790
turned out to be a good idea.

00:32:55.790 --> 00:32:58.520
First of all, for proving this
theoretical result, you could

00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:01.740
get exponentially-decreasing
error rate for polynomial

00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:04.190
increasing decoding
complexity.

00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:06.830
And within about 10 years,
this is what

00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:08.080
people actually did.

00:33:10.510 --> 00:33:14.370
And, in fact, what people
actually did --

00:33:14.370 --> 00:33:19.390
I've got a block code here, but
what people actually did

00:33:19.390 --> 00:33:22.220
was they used a short
constraint length

00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:25.380
convolutional code here,
which we'll be talking

00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:28.450
about after the break.

00:33:28.450 --> 00:33:31.260
Convolutional codes tend to
have a better performance

00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:34.860
complexity tradeoff,
particularly in soft decision

00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:37.060
situations than block
codes do.

00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:42.270
So in a practical system, it's
almost always better to use a

00:33:42.270 --> 00:33:44.110
convolutional code than
a block code.

00:33:44.110 --> 00:33:46.710
We'll discuss the reasons why.

00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:50.270
So this convolutional code
here, there is a maximum

00:33:50.270 --> 00:33:53.550
likelihood sequence detector
for the convolutional code

00:33:53.550 --> 00:33:55.710
down here, which is the Viterbi
algorithm, which

00:33:55.710 --> 00:33:58.550
you've probably all
heard about.

00:33:58.550 --> 00:34:02.390
And this is very practical as
long as the constraint length,

00:34:02.390 --> 00:34:05.710
k, now becomes the constraint
length, nu, of the code

00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:07.600
doesn't get too large.

00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:12.820
So for about 20 years, the
standard for space

00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:20.330
communication was this was a
(255, 223, 33) Reed-Solomon

00:34:20.330 --> 00:34:27.270
code over F-256.

00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:35.560
This is a constraint length 6,
rate 1/2 convolutional code.

00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:45.270
This is a 64-state Viterbi
algorithm.

00:34:45.270 --> 00:34:48.380
So what's the --

00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:52.320
again, if we have a look at the
error channel, here is a

00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:54.790
stream of bits coming along.

00:34:54.790 --> 00:34:58.960
After encoding and decoding,
what we typically see is

00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:02.260
bursts of errors, all right?

00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:04.640
So you get a burst
that starts --

00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:08.040
in convolutional codes, it can
start at a random time, end at

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:09.355
a random time.

00:35:09.355 --> 00:35:14.730
You might get another discrete
error event over here.

00:35:14.730 --> 00:35:16.520
In other words, most
of the time, the

00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:19.430
decoder is decoding properly.

00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:22.220
What you're receiving is what
you transmitted in a

00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:24.150
streamwise fashion.

00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:27.510
The bits just are transmitted
forever.

00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:30.250
But every so often, the decoder
gets off on the wrong

00:35:30.250 --> 00:35:33.000
track, puts out errors for
a while, then gets

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.680
resynchronized, and decodes
correctly again.

00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:40.140
Is my picture clear?

00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:44.970
I'm using words, mainly, to tell
you what it represents.

00:35:44.970 --> 00:35:47.290
OK.

00:35:47.290 --> 00:35:52.230
So now, basically, what you want
to do is, just as we did

00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:56.940
in the packet communication
case, you want to send

00:35:56.940 --> 00:36:05.940
multiple parallel streams, up
to 256 of them, such that in

00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:09.870
this stream, you're going to get
independent error blocks.

00:36:09.870 --> 00:36:12.710
And this one, you're
going to get errors

00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:13.900
occurring somewhere else.

00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:16.550
They're going to have
a typical length.

00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:21.290
You can very well estimate what
the typical length of

00:36:21.290 --> 00:36:24.390
error events is, but they
occur randomly.

00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:27.010
And now you use the Reed-Solomon
code, coding

00:36:27.010 --> 00:36:35.430
across this, and that will
basically give you this

00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:36.680
picture over here.

00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:42.670
How would I get this?

00:36:42.670 --> 00:36:54.570
One way is by using a block
interleaver, which is

00:36:54.570 --> 00:36:56.285
described in the notes.

00:36:56.285 --> 00:37:01.040
A block interleaver, you
basically take a long block

00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:05.470
from the convolutional code
and you just encode and

00:37:05.470 --> 00:37:08.350
transmit along here and
ultimately decode.

00:37:08.350 --> 00:37:11.350
And after a very long time,
you come back and start

00:37:11.350 --> 00:37:13.110
transmitting the second
row just as

00:37:13.110 --> 00:37:15.140
part of the same stream.

00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:19.760
And then the third
row and so forth.

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:26.630
And if the block length n,
here, is long enough, the

00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:28.490
errors in different rows
will be effectively

00:37:28.490 --> 00:37:31.560
independent, all right?

00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:34.850
So again, you wind up with
very long blocks in this

00:37:34.850 --> 00:37:39.365
scheme, but analytically,
it works.

00:37:39.365 --> 00:37:45.106
And in practice, this is roughly
what's done, except

00:37:45.106 --> 00:37:47.740
there is such a thing as a
convolutional interleaver,

00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:52.790
which again, operates streamwise
and actually

00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:55.571
performs better in practice.

00:37:55.571 --> 00:37:58.300
But I won't take the time to go
into this because we're not

00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:01.470
going to really be getting into
things like interleavers.

00:38:01.470 --> 00:38:03.780
Do you see how this works?

00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:05.060
OK.

00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:08.300
So it works well
theoretically.

00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:10.380
It gives us the theoretical
result we want.

00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:12.345
Works well in practice.

00:38:15.570 --> 00:38:17.420
As I say, this was the
standard for space

00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:23.710
communications during the
'70s and the '80s.

00:38:23.710 --> 00:38:27.600
Around the end of the '80s,
they upgraded this.

00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:35.860
First of all, they replaced this
by a nu equals 14, rate

00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:41.780
1/6, lower rate convolutional
code, so this now becomes a 2

00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:46.075
to the 1fourth state
Viterbi decoder.

00:38:46.075 --> 00:38:53.110
They built this huge rack at
JPL that had 8,192 parallel

00:38:53.110 --> 00:38:55.770
decoding units,
add-compare-select units in

00:38:55.770 --> 00:38:58.560
the Viterbi algorithm,
to decode this thing.

00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:01.150
But, of course, they only need
to do that in one place, in

00:39:01.150 --> 00:39:02.130
the space program.

00:39:02.130 --> 00:39:04.560
Everything comes back to JPL.

00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:07.650
So they built this BVD,
Big Viterbi decoder.

00:39:10.210 --> 00:39:15.130
And first, they used it with
this code and then they souped

00:39:15.130 --> 00:39:17.110
up the Reed-Solomon code.

00:39:17.110 --> 00:39:23.810
And by about 1990, 1991, they
got this thing operating up

00:39:23.810 --> 00:39:27.980
within about 2 dB of the
Shannon limit, OK?

00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:32.200
Which was considered a heroic
feat at the time, or even now.

00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:36.090
So that kind of tells you, in
the terms we've been using in

00:39:36.090 --> 00:39:39.400
this course, just what
you can get out of

00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:40.650
this kind of approach.

00:39:44.310 --> 00:39:48.520
At that point, that was
considered coding is dead.

00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:49.770
There's really nothing
more to do.

00:39:49.770 --> 00:39:53.000
We're within about 2 dB of the
Shannon limit and it's

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:54.820
inconceivable that we
could actually get

00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:56.850
any closer than that.

00:39:56.850 --> 00:39:59.600
Second half of the course will,
of course, tell us how

00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:03.290
we can get within 0.0045 dB
of the Shannon limit.

00:40:03.290 --> 00:40:06.250
But that was the state of
the art as of about

00:40:06.250 --> 00:40:11.460
1990, 15 years ago.

00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:12.310
Questions?

00:40:12.310 --> 00:40:14.670
Comments?

00:40:14.670 --> 00:40:15.920
OK.

00:40:18.850 --> 00:40:19.220
All right.

00:40:19.220 --> 00:40:25.260
I'll just mention a third
application is burst error

00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:28.990
correction, which really,
we've already

00:40:28.990 --> 00:40:30.240
been talking about.

00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:37.970
Suppose --

00:40:37.970 --> 00:40:40.270
let's let this be a
naked channel now.

00:40:40.270 --> 00:40:42.870
Suppose you're transmitting
with an

00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:44.210
interleave scheme like this.

00:40:44.210 --> 00:40:46.880
And now, in the same way --

00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:49.250
it's a radio channel or
something and every so often,

00:40:49.250 --> 00:40:53.960
you have an outage just due to
fading, or a thunderstorm, or

00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:58.010
somebody turns on his vacuum
cleaner, or whatever.

00:40:58.010 --> 00:41:00.200
Every so often, as you
transmit, you're

00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:01.000
going to get bursts.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:02.330
You don't have independent,

00:41:02.330 --> 00:41:04.350
identically-distributed errors.

00:41:04.350 --> 00:41:07.090
The character of the channel is
such that you see bursts of

00:41:07.090 --> 00:41:10.210
errors, which is precisely
what you do in this super

00:41:10.210 --> 00:41:11.670
channel here.

00:41:11.670 --> 00:41:16.380
Every so often, you see a bunch
of errors if you have

00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:20.470
the original transmitted scheme
to compare it to.

00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:21.120
All right.

00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:24.290
In exactly the same way,
you can code --

00:41:24.290 --> 00:41:27.470
with something like this block
interleaver, you can code

00:41:27.470 --> 00:41:31.950
across channels and correct
the bursts with

00:41:31.950 --> 00:41:33.850
Reed-Solomon codes.

00:41:33.850 --> 00:41:37.100
And here, it's quite easy
to show that, because

00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:40.630
Reed-Solomon codes have optimal
parameters n, k, d,

00:41:40.630 --> 00:41:44.140
that Reed-Solomon codes do
the best possible job of

00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:48.180
correcting burst errors that you
possibly could do, given

00:41:48.180 --> 00:41:52.580
some specification for how long
the bursts could possibly

00:41:52.580 --> 00:42:00.820
be and the minimum guard
space between bursts.

00:42:00.820 --> 00:42:03.410
This is classical stuff.

00:42:03.410 --> 00:42:06.820
Reed-Solomon codes are optimum
burst correctors if you

00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:11.750
describe the burst channel by
max burst length in a minimum

00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:14.029
guard space.

00:42:14.029 --> 00:42:15.980
Is that too brief?

00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:17.040
Probably is.

00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:19.700
Give you some impression of
what we're talking about.

00:42:19.700 --> 00:42:22.920
So Reed-Solomon codes are
optimum for burst error

00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:29.750
correction, which, most real
channels are bursty.

00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:33.500
The only non-bursty channel
that we really have is the

00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:36.300
additive white Gaussian noise
channel, ultimately.

00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:39.100
That is the channel in space
communications, which is why

00:42:39.100 --> 00:42:45.280
you can apply a nice,
textbook-type code like this

00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:46.810
to the space channel.

00:42:46.810 --> 00:42:49.250
For any other channel,
typically, you have to use

00:42:49.250 --> 00:42:52.460
some kind of interleaving to
break up the bursts so

00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:54.340
that you can --

00:42:54.340 --> 00:42:58.120
this simply is no information
over a long time.

00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:01.310
If you tried to encode crossways
on this, you'd have

00:43:01.310 --> 00:43:05.700
to have a code that's long
enough to see the average

00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:07.890
burst's behavior.

00:43:07.890 --> 00:43:13.370
We'd make the burst have
an ergodic model.

00:43:13.370 --> 00:43:16.160
The way to do that in practice
is to code across it so you

00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:21.180
get independent snippets of
widely separated bursts which

00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:23.156
can be assumed to
be independent.

00:43:23.156 --> 00:43:23.650
Yeah.

00:43:23.650 --> 00:43:24.900
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:43:28.890 --> 00:43:30.080
PROFESSOR: No different,
really.

00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:33.377
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:33.377 --> 00:43:36.010
PROFESSOR: Yeah, in space
channel -- all right.

00:43:36.010 --> 00:43:37.830
Here, I'm talking about
power limit.

00:43:37.830 --> 00:43:40.300
That's a good question.

00:43:40.300 --> 00:43:44.540
But if you think about the
band-limited regime,

00:43:44.540 --> 00:43:45.640
let's suppose --

00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:48.320
so this would be some
[? MRE ?] channel.

00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:53.570
You would use some multilevel
signaling scheme like QAM with

00:43:53.570 --> 00:43:58.530
a large signal set or QPSK or
something like that to get a

00:43:58.530 --> 00:44:02.710
basic transmission with a
discrete signal set that

00:44:02.710 --> 00:44:05.460
doesn't lose too much
over sending

00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:08.730
Gaussian over the channel.

00:44:08.730 --> 00:44:11.440
Again, this will be later
in the course.

00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:13.480
We'll talk about
this in detail.

00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:15.770
Other than that --

00:44:15.770 --> 00:44:18.940
well, all right, so now this
is an MRE channel.

00:44:18.940 --> 00:44:22.660
If M is large enough, then you
could apply Reed-Solomon codes

00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:23.410
right here.

00:44:23.410 --> 00:44:24.950
But typically, it's not.

00:44:24.950 --> 00:44:28.590
M is like 16 or 64.

00:44:28.590 --> 00:44:32.940
And so Reed-Solomon codes would
still be too short.

00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:34.370
You would not be able
to get long enough

00:44:34.370 --> 00:44:36.280
codes over such a channel.

00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:40.210
So a similar kind of
thing can be done.

00:44:40.210 --> 00:44:43.250
And the history of
bandwidth-limited coding

00:44:43.250 --> 00:44:47.530
pretty much parallels that
of power-limited coding.

00:44:47.530 --> 00:44:52.740
What corresponds to block codes
here is lattice codes

00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:53.820
for this channel.

00:44:53.820 --> 00:44:56.180
What corresponds to
convolutional codes is

00:44:56.180 --> 00:44:59.510
trellis-coded modulation.

00:44:59.510 --> 00:45:05.180
And again, once you handle the
basic physical channel with

00:45:05.180 --> 00:45:08.160
these codes that are well
matched to that channel but

00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:11.420
whose complexity increases too
rapidly if you make them long

00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:15.510
because of exponential decoding,
then you can always

00:45:15.510 --> 00:45:18.430
clean up whatever
errors you make.

00:45:18.430 --> 00:45:22.030
You can think of this as a
cleanup function out here.

00:45:22.030 --> 00:45:24.290
Typically, the rates out
here are very high.

00:45:24.290 --> 00:45:26.120
You don't need much
redundancy.

00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:30.550
It doesn't cost too much
in overall rate.

00:45:30.550 --> 00:45:36.340
But even with very high rates,
like 223 over 255, you can do

00:45:36.340 --> 00:45:38.225
a rather large amount
of error correction.

00:45:38.225 --> 00:45:41.430
You can correct up to
16 errors or 32

00:45:41.430 --> 00:45:42.980
erasures with us channel.

00:45:42.980 --> 00:45:45.720
So this is a cleanup function.

00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:49.310
You basically work very hard
in here, get the best error

00:45:49.310 --> 00:45:51.430
probability you can, which --

00:45:51.430 --> 00:45:52.740
it doesn't have to be too low.

00:45:52.740 --> 00:45:55.340
10 to the minus 2, 10
to the minus 3.

00:45:55.340 --> 00:45:57.900
And then you use this to clean
it up and that drives the

00:45:57.900 --> 00:46:00.428
error probability down to 10 to
the minus 12 or 10 to the

00:46:00.428 --> 00:46:02.360
minus 15 or whatever
you really want.

00:46:05.910 --> 00:46:09.187
But the principles are
the same in power

00:46:09.187 --> 00:46:10.660
limit and band limit.

00:46:10.660 --> 00:46:13.730
But nice question.

00:46:13.730 --> 00:46:14.980
Any other questions?

00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:19.250
OK.

00:46:19.250 --> 00:46:26.290
So as a result, Reed-Solomon
codes are the general purpose

00:46:26.290 --> 00:46:32.310
code that has emerged from
algebraic coding theory.

00:46:32.310 --> 00:46:37.080
A good example of burst error
correction is, you know on

00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:41.260
your CDs, there is an error
correction scheme incorporated

00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:45.610
such that if you scratch
the CD, it still works.

00:46:45.610 --> 00:46:46.240
How does that work?

00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:48.380
It could only be because
there's some error

00:46:48.380 --> 00:46:49.150
correction in there.

00:46:49.150 --> 00:46:53.810
What, actually, is the error
correction scheme?

00:46:53.810 --> 00:46:58.000
I'm not sure I know what the
latest and greatest is, but

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:01.310
generally, the error correction
schemes for

00:47:01.310 --> 00:47:05.700
magnetic memory recording
like that have used

00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:08.160
Reed-Solomon codes --

00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:11.040
have used two Reed-Solomon
codes in interleave

00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:11.960
fashion like this.

00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:14.290
So the across code
is Reed-Solomon.

00:47:14.290 --> 00:47:16.220
The down code is Reed-Solomon.

00:47:16.220 --> 00:47:20.820
As a result, if you make a
scratch through the disc, you

00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:28.980
will cut all of these codes, but
you will cut each one in a

00:47:28.980 --> 00:47:32.300
small enough place so that
you can correct it.

00:47:32.300 --> 00:47:34.620
So you can think of this as a
actually a physical laying

00:47:34.620 --> 00:47:38.820
down of Reed-Solomon codes on
the two-dimensional surface of

00:47:38.820 --> 00:47:41.710
the disc in such a way that --

00:47:41.710 --> 00:47:45.350
well, even if your scratch came
right across one whole

00:47:45.350 --> 00:47:48.780
channel here, then, of course,
this decoder would be dead.

00:47:48.780 --> 00:47:52.590
But you still have somebody
decoding in this direction to

00:47:52.590 --> 00:47:54.740
pick up the errors.

00:47:54.740 --> 00:47:58.000
And so that's why you can
completely abuse these discs

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:01.160
and they still work.

00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:02.750
And when you think about what's
actually going on,

00:48:02.750 --> 00:48:10.120
think of the transfer rates from
a CD to your computer.

00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:15.160
It's up in the hundreds of
millions of bits per second.

00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:16.950
Maybe its gigabits by now.

00:48:16.950 --> 00:48:18.380
Perhaps it is.

00:48:18.380 --> 00:48:20.130
And you've got this
Reed-Solomon --

00:48:20.130 --> 00:48:22.700
these are non-trivial
Reed-Solomon decoders.

00:48:22.700 --> 00:48:27.020
These are like this 16 error
correcting decoder out here.

00:48:27.020 --> 00:48:31.420
And so these are working away at
that data rate, capable of

00:48:31.420 --> 00:48:31.945
doing decoding.

00:48:31.945 --> 00:48:35.620
And they're cheap enough so that
they're just buried in

00:48:35.620 --> 00:48:38.990
part of one of the integrated
circuits in

00:48:38.990 --> 00:48:41.520
your disc player circuitry.

00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:47.150
So that'd give you a physical
sense for just how much error

00:48:47.150 --> 00:48:52.090
correction power and speed you
can get out of this class of

00:48:52.090 --> 00:48:57.050
code decoder, OK?

00:48:57.050 --> 00:49:01.110
So wherever you want an
extremely powerful code and

00:49:01.110 --> 00:49:03.470
you're a little bit less
concerned with getting to

00:49:03.470 --> 00:49:07.045
capacity, Reed-Solomon code
is the way to go.

00:49:07.045 --> 00:49:12.610
It's absolutely part of
your toolbox, OK?

00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:30.350
The last topic in chapter eight
is BCH codes, which are

00:49:30.350 --> 00:49:33.310
binary codes.

00:49:33.310 --> 00:49:39.760
So they're binary linear block
codes of the class we've been

00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:44.640
discussing, comparable with
Reed-Muller codes.

00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:48.960
Reed-Muller codes were
discovered in 1954 in two

00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:53.670
separate papers by Reed
and by Muller in two

00:49:53.670 --> 00:49:54.790
separate points of view.

00:49:54.790 --> 00:49:57.760
And there are a million points
of view you can have for

00:49:57.760 --> 00:49:58.470
Reed-Muller codes.

00:49:58.470 --> 00:50:00.050
We've used yet a third one.

00:50:02.590 --> 00:50:09.880
BCH stands for Bose and
Chaudhury and Hocquenghem.

00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:13.290
Bose and Chaudhury were both
professors in the US.

00:50:13.290 --> 00:50:18.310
They wrote a paper about 1960
introducing Reed-Solomon

00:50:18.310 --> 00:50:23.040
codes, which, by the way, and
introducing BC codes --

00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:25.240
Bose-Chaudhury codes --

00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:28.040
Reed-Solomon's paper
was in 1960 also.

00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:31.260
These were completely
independent of each other.

00:50:31.260 --> 00:50:35.660
And then this fellow named
Hocquenghem in France, whose

00:50:35.660 --> 00:50:41.230
name I can't and few people can
pronounce, turned out he

00:50:41.230 --> 00:50:45.770
had actually invented these
codes in 1959 in a paper that

00:50:45.770 --> 00:50:49.750
unfortunately was in French,
so few people read it.

00:50:49.750 --> 00:50:52.120
But anyway, in honor of all
three of these people, these

00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:54.340
are called BCH codes.

00:50:54.340 --> 00:50:58.070
These fit right into the main
theme of algebraic coding

00:50:58.070 --> 00:50:59.080
theory at that time.

00:50:59.080 --> 00:51:02.190
Maybe stimulated it because
these turned out to be cyclic

00:51:02.190 --> 00:51:05.920
codes, or at least as they were
originally introduced.

00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:15.130
And so when I was in school,
which was in the early '60s,

00:51:15.130 --> 00:51:18.590
these were considered the
greatest thing going.

00:51:18.590 --> 00:51:23.500
People were interested in binary
codes, algebraic codes

00:51:23.500 --> 00:51:29.570
because they are slightly better
than Reed-Muller codes.

00:51:29.570 --> 00:51:31.980
Now, I would say, there's sort
of been a swing back.

00:51:31.980 --> 00:51:35.780
Shu Lin gave a paper about
10 years ago that said

00:51:35.780 --> 00:51:38.140
Reed-Muller codes
are not so bad.

00:51:38.140 --> 00:51:41.140
In fact, in terms of performance
versus complexity

00:51:41.140 --> 00:51:43.690
for certain kinds of decoding
schemes, trellis-based

00:51:43.690 --> 00:51:48.000
decoding, Reed-Muller codes
are better than BCH codes.

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:50.280
So from a more modern
prospective, we're more

00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:53.520
interested in Reed-Muller
than we are in BCH.

00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:57.790
Nonetheless, you'll hear about
these a lot if you read the

00:51:57.790 --> 00:52:01.780
literature and so you ought
to know what they are.

00:52:01.780 --> 00:52:02.560
OK.

00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:05.890
Conceptually, what are they?

00:52:05.890 --> 00:52:11.440
Since we already know about
Reed-Solomon codes, the way

00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:15.760
that I'm going to characterize
BCH codes is as subfield

00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:19.480
subcodes of the Reed-Solomon
codes.

00:52:19.480 --> 00:52:25.440
Now, if we have a Reed-Solomon
code over F2 to the 8 or

00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:32.800
something, the field with 256
elements, or any power of 2,

00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:37.240
contains a subfield which is
just 0 and 1, all right?

00:52:37.240 --> 00:52:40.760
All fields contains 0 and 1.

00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:43.500
If the field has characteristic
2, then 0 and 1

00:52:43.500 --> 00:52:47.730
all by themselves are
the prime subfield.

00:52:47.730 --> 00:52:51.490
So it's possible that there
are certain words in the

00:52:51.490 --> 00:52:55.660
Reed-Muller code -- sorry, in
the Reed-Solomon code that are

00:52:55.660 --> 00:52:58.760
completely made up
of 0's and 1's.

00:52:58.760 --> 00:53:00.740
For instance, the all-0 word
is certainly in the

00:53:00.740 --> 00:53:04.260
Reed-Solomon code, so we have,
at least, that one that's made

00:53:04.260 --> 00:53:05.890
up of all zeros.

00:53:05.890 --> 00:53:10.440
Almost always, we find that the
all-1 word is a code word.

00:53:10.440 --> 00:53:14.350
So we have a code with
all 0's and all 1's.

00:53:14.350 --> 00:53:16.140
And there might be
more of them.

00:53:16.140 --> 00:53:19.920
And that's actually very
straightforward, to find out

00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:25.290
how many completely binary
words there are in a

00:53:25.290 --> 00:53:26.540
Reed-Solomon code.

00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:37.080
So it's the binary subfield.

00:53:41.950 --> 00:53:55.080
We have F2 is a subfield of F2
to the M for all M. OK, so a

00:53:55.080 --> 00:54:07.650
subfield subcode, if we have
an n, k, d equals n minus k

00:54:07.650 --> 00:54:24.250
plus 1 Reed-Solomon code, then
the set of all BCH code is the

00:54:24.250 --> 00:54:32.780
set of all binary code words,
code words that just use the 0

00:54:32.780 --> 00:54:34.155
and 1 of the code alphabet.

00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:44.320
Call this c in C. So we
call this C prime.

00:54:48.780 --> 00:54:52.350
OK, so what are its parameters
going to be?

00:54:52.350 --> 00:54:56.600
Its length is still going
to be n, right?

00:54:56.600 --> 00:55:00.360
All the code words here are
n-tuples, so these have got to

00:55:00.360 --> 00:55:02.940
be n-tuples.

00:55:02.940 --> 00:55:04.230
We don't know its dimension.

00:55:04.230 --> 00:55:06.110
Let's just call it k prime.

00:55:06.110 --> 00:55:08.820
That's how many such code
words are there?

00:55:08.820 --> 00:55:14.190
We're going to have to
do some combinatorics

00:55:14.190 --> 00:55:17.230
to find that out.

00:55:17.230 --> 00:55:20.600
And what's the minimum
distance going to be?

00:55:20.600 --> 00:55:21.850
Anybody?

00:55:24.791 --> 00:55:27.629
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:27.629 --> 00:55:32.360
PROFESSOR: In general, well,
it's certainly not going to be

00:55:32.360 --> 00:55:38.090
less than because, by definition
of the minimum

00:55:38.090 --> 00:55:41.270
distance, the minimum Hamming
distance between any two code

00:55:41.270 --> 00:55:45.730
words in this code is d, so
we're just looking at a subset

00:55:45.730 --> 00:55:47.990
of the code words
in this code.

00:55:47.990 --> 00:55:51.990
And the minimum squared distance
has to be at least d.

00:55:54.780 --> 00:55:56.730
There's an example given
in the notes.

00:55:56.730 --> 00:56:02.420
If we let c be the 4, 3 --

00:56:02.420 --> 00:56:11.110
I think it's the 4, 2, 3, over
F4, then C prime turns out to

00:56:11.110 --> 00:56:15.390
be the 4, 1, 4 code over F2.

00:56:19.390 --> 00:56:22.420
In other words, the only two
code words in this code that

00:56:22.420 --> 00:56:26.900
are all binary are the all-0
and all-1 sequences.

00:56:26.900 --> 00:56:27.310
All right?

00:56:27.310 --> 00:56:30.720
So we actually get a minimum
distance of 4.

00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:33.470
It has to be at least 3 in
this particular case, so

00:56:33.470 --> 00:56:38.170
here's an example where it
could be greater than 3.

00:56:38.170 --> 00:56:41.110
Or if there are cases where the
subcode just consists of

00:56:41.110 --> 00:56:45.080
the all-0 word, then that, by
convention, has an infinite

00:56:45.080 --> 00:56:47.330
minimum distance.

00:56:47.330 --> 00:56:51.270
So distance could be greater,
but it never can be less than

00:56:51.270 --> 00:56:52.980
what you started with.

00:56:52.980 --> 00:56:56.030
On the other hand,
the dimension is

00:56:56.030 --> 00:56:58.100
clearly going to go down.

00:56:58.100 --> 00:57:00.980
If it were still equal to what
it was, then we'd have a

00:57:00.980 --> 00:57:06.860
binary MDS code and we know we
don't get binary MDS codes.

00:57:06.860 --> 00:57:11.230
So in general, k prime decreases
quite a bit.

00:57:11.230 --> 00:57:14.640
In this case, it just
decreases by 1.

00:57:14.640 --> 00:57:17.035
And we have to find out
how it decreases.

00:57:22.510 --> 00:57:22.920
OK.

00:57:22.920 --> 00:57:33.060
I'm a little uncertain as to how
much of the derivation --

00:57:33.060 --> 00:57:34.535
so we need to find --

00:57:37.676 --> 00:57:38.878
AUDIENCE: Is that [INAUDIBLE]
at all points of

00:57:38.878 --> 00:57:40.128
the field, is it?

00:57:48.627 --> 00:57:51.320
PROFESSOR: No.

00:57:51.320 --> 00:57:54.830
One of the characterizations
you have of Reed-Solomon

00:57:54.830 --> 00:58:00.390
codes, I assume, was that
they're the set of all

00:58:00.390 --> 00:58:06.040
polynomials of length n that
evaluate to 0 at some

00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:12.310
consecutive set of n minus
k powers of alpha.

00:58:12.310 --> 00:58:13.690
Did you see anything
like that?

00:58:13.690 --> 00:58:14.881
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:58:14.881 --> 00:58:16.030
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:58:16.030 --> 00:58:18.950
In other words, they're --

00:58:18.950 --> 00:58:33.450
let me write that down because
RS code is the set of all

00:58:33.450 --> 00:58:55.686
multiples f of x, g of x, of
degree less than n where of g

00:58:55.686 --> 00:59:04.560
of x equals the product of x
minus alpha to the i for i

00:59:04.560 --> 00:59:10.140
equals 0 to n minus k minus one
or something like that.

00:59:10.140 --> 00:59:13.870
This is called a generator
polynomial and --

00:59:13.870 --> 00:59:14.940
so what does this mean?

00:59:14.940 --> 00:59:18.480
In other language, all
polynomials of degree less

00:59:18.480 --> 00:59:23.220
than n that have roots
at 1 alpha, alpha

00:59:23.220 --> 00:59:26.030
squared, or so forth.

00:59:26.030 --> 00:59:30.330
It's better to make this i
equals 1 to n minus k.

00:59:30.330 --> 00:59:33.170
You can also make it minus i.

00:59:33.170 --> 00:59:36.090
There are lots of
details in here.

00:59:36.090 --> 00:59:38.950
But I'll just ask you broadly
to recall that

00:59:38.950 --> 00:59:40.570
characterization.

00:59:40.570 --> 00:59:41.270
This is a --

00:59:41.270 --> 00:59:44.024
AUDIENCE: I have another
question.

00:59:44.024 --> 00:59:46.319
[INAUDIBLE] are not linear?

00:59:46.319 --> 00:59:48.280
PROFESSOR: OK, let's ask that.

00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:58.340
So we've got a set of
binary n-tuples, OK,

00:59:58.340 --> 01:00:01.160
defined as the subset.

01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:02.720
So what do we need to
do to see whether

01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:03.560
it's linear or not?

01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:06.422
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:00:06.422 --> 01:00:08.320
PROFESSOR: We just check
the group property.

01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:11.710
Is it closed under addition?

01:00:11.710 --> 01:00:14.150
Suppose we take two of these
code words we add them

01:00:14.150 --> 01:00:17.590
together, component-wise,
vector form.

01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:26.070
Seems to me we get A, that gives
us another code word in

01:00:26.070 --> 01:00:29.500
the Reed-Solomon code because
it's closed under addition,

01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:33.690
and B, by the addition rules,
it's going to be another

01:00:33.690 --> 01:00:37.950
binary code word, all right?

01:00:37.950 --> 01:00:40.450
So it's another binary code
word in the RS code,

01:00:40.450 --> 01:00:42.230
therefore, it's in C prime.

01:00:42.230 --> 01:00:45.670
So that's proof that, in fact,
this code is linear.

01:00:45.670 --> 01:00:49.250
AUDIENCE: What about
[INAUDIBLE]?

01:00:49.250 --> 01:00:50.620
PROFESSOR: That's trivial.

01:00:50.620 --> 01:00:53.190
For a binary code, we only
have to consider two

01:00:53.190 --> 01:00:54.610
scalars, 0 and 1.

01:00:54.610 --> 01:00:55.860
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

01:00:58.186 --> 01:01:00.160
PROFESSOR: But now I'm
asking whether this

01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:01.410
binary code is linear.

01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:05.310
There's the code over F2.

01:01:08.418 --> 01:01:08.901
Yes?

01:01:08.901 --> 01:01:09.867
You had a --

01:01:09.867 --> 01:01:11.450
AUDIENCE: Same question.

01:01:11.450 --> 01:01:16.260
The base field is F2 to the x,
so if you add 1 and 1 there,

01:01:16.260 --> 01:01:17.740
it wouldn't be just 0.

01:01:17.740 --> 01:01:22.138
But I guess if you restrict the
field to F2, you have to

01:01:22.138 --> 01:01:23.745
check everything again,
don't you?

01:01:23.745 --> 01:01:29.710
PROFESSOR: No, because we said
F2 is the subfield of F2 to

01:01:29.710 --> 01:01:34.230
the M. And what we actually
showed was that if you just

01:01:34.230 --> 01:01:39.520
stay in the prime field, the
integers of the field, then

01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:41.660
you get exactly the same
addition and multiplication

01:01:41.660 --> 01:01:46.400
rules as you do in
the prime field.

01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:50.570
So in fact, in a field of
characteristic 2, we always

01:01:50.570 --> 01:01:57.710
have 0 plus 1 is 1, 0 plus 1
plus 0 is 1, 1 plus 1 is 0.

01:01:57.710 --> 01:02:01.600
That last one is the only one
you really have to check.

01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:05.840
So that accounts for the
definition of characteristic,

01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:09.750
and that's the reason we can
always use just plus signs,

01:02:09.750 --> 01:02:11.890
because subtraction is
the same as addition.

01:02:11.890 --> 01:02:13.140
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

01:02:16.128 --> 01:02:17.810
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:02:17.810 --> 01:02:19.060
We showed --

01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:24.255
well, very simple proof.

01:02:28.290 --> 01:02:30.940
The order of a subgroup has
to define the order of

01:02:30.940 --> 01:02:32.420
the group it's in.

01:02:32.420 --> 01:02:35.570
The additive group of the prime
field has order 2 to the

01:02:35.570 --> 01:02:38.480
M, so it has to be some divisor
of 2 to the M, which

01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:39.730
is a prime.

01:02:43.740 --> 01:02:45.930
I think we proved that another
way, but that's

01:02:45.930 --> 01:02:49.330
a very simple proof.

01:02:49.330 --> 01:02:54.350
OK, great questions, because it
shows you're thinking about

01:02:54.350 --> 01:02:57.210
how this relates to what you
learned back in chapter seven.

01:02:57.210 --> 01:03:00.420
But at this point you've kind
of got a little vague about

01:03:00.420 --> 01:03:02.810
chapter seven, what's
really in there.

01:03:02.810 --> 01:03:04.820
By Wednesday, you're really
going to know

01:03:04.820 --> 01:03:05.900
chapter seven well.

01:03:05.900 --> 01:03:07.150
Let me tell you.

01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:12.640
OK.

01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:14.370
Good.

01:03:14.370 --> 01:03:16.290
Thank you for the help.

01:03:16.290 --> 01:03:18.680
Because these are all things
that I should have just said

01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:21.290
up here, but they come out much
better, actually, if they

01:03:21.290 --> 01:03:22.700
come out in response
to questions.

01:03:26.190 --> 01:03:27.440
OK.

01:03:29.650 --> 01:03:36.990
So here's one characterization
of a Reed-Solomon code which

01:03:36.990 --> 01:03:38.290
apparently you did see.

01:03:38.290 --> 01:03:41.430
It's the set of all multiples of
some generator polynomial.

01:03:41.430 --> 01:03:45.200
The generator polynomial is
described as this polynomial

01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:53.290
of degree n minus k whose roots
are precisely alpha up

01:03:53.290 --> 01:03:55.300
through alpha to
the n minus k.

01:03:55.300 --> 01:03:56.890
You did say that?

01:03:56.890 --> 01:03:58.140
OK.

01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:10.460
So similarly, the BCH code --

01:04:10.460 --> 01:04:14.030
I'm just going to assert this
just to show you how it goes.

01:04:14.030 --> 01:04:27.550
It's the set of all multiples of
g prime of x, which is the

01:04:27.550 --> 01:04:47.590
minimal degree binary
polynomial

01:04:47.590 --> 01:04:50.610
with the same roots.

01:04:55.810 --> 01:04:57.616
Now, how can a binary
polynomial --

01:05:01.940 --> 01:05:06.158
alpha to the n minus k.

01:05:06.158 --> 01:05:09.280
How can a binary polynomial
have non-binary roots?

01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:15.290
Well, it clearly can.

01:05:15.290 --> 01:05:18.615
Let's consider g
of prime of x.

01:05:21.260 --> 01:05:29.030
It's an element of F2 to the x,
the set of all polynomials

01:05:29.030 --> 01:05:37.550
over F2, which is a subset of
the set of all polynomials

01:05:37.550 --> 01:05:39.390
over 2 to the M for
the same reason.

01:05:39.390 --> 01:05:43.600
F2 is the subfield of F2 to
the M, so some of the

01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:47.250
polynomials over F2 to the
M have purely binary

01:05:47.250 --> 01:05:49.040
coefficients, all right?

01:05:49.040 --> 01:05:51.950
So that's the sense --

01:05:51.950 --> 01:05:54.615
that's how we can get between
these two things.

01:06:05.260 --> 01:06:12.660
So some binary polynomials have
roots in GF of 2 the M

01:06:12.660 --> 01:06:14.020
let me give you an example.

01:06:16.890 --> 01:06:29.860
Let's consider x squared plus x
plus 1 as a polynomial in F4

01:06:29.860 --> 01:06:37.320
of x, which is certainly is.

01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:42.740
It's a polynomial of degree
2 and F4 of x.

01:06:42.740 --> 01:06:45.740
What are its roots in F4 of x?

01:06:45.740 --> 01:06:48.890
Does it have any roots
in F4 of x?

01:06:48.890 --> 01:06:51.890
Does it have any
roots in F2 --

01:06:51.890 --> 01:06:56.270
sorry, I'm asking whether
it has any roots in F4.

01:06:56.270 --> 01:07:00.230
Now I step back and ask if
it has any roots in F2.

01:07:00.230 --> 01:07:01.320
So how do we do that?

01:07:01.320 --> 01:07:08.150
We just ask if F of x
is 0 for x equals 0.

01:07:08.150 --> 01:07:09.080
We get 1.

01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:12.680
So it's not a root of 0.

01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:15.610
Substitute 1, we get
1 plus 1 plus 1.

01:07:15.610 --> 01:07:19.340
1 is not a root F of x.

01:07:19.340 --> 01:07:20.000
All right.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.620
Well, we have two
more candidates.

01:07:21.620 --> 01:07:23.416
How about alpha?

01:07:23.416 --> 01:07:29.490
For alpha, we get F of alpha
equals alpha squared plus

01:07:29.490 --> 01:07:32.700
alpha plus 1.

01:07:32.700 --> 01:07:37.580
And if you remember the addition
table of F4, however

01:07:37.580 --> 01:07:42.220
it's constructed, this
equals 0, OK?

01:07:50.850 --> 01:07:52.925
0, 1, alpha, alpha, squared.

01:07:52.925 --> 01:07:55.370
0, 1 alpha, alpha squared.

01:07:55.370 --> 01:07:59.040
0, 1, alpha, alpha, squared.

01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:00.706
This is plus.

01:08:00.706 --> 01:08:03.190
1, alpha, alpha, squared.

01:08:03.190 --> 01:08:06.850
0, 1 plus alpha is
alpha squared.

01:08:06.850 --> 01:08:09.090
1 plus alpha squared is alpha.

01:08:09.090 --> 01:08:12.130
Any of these is telling
you the same thing.

01:08:12.130 --> 01:08:15.810
0, 1, 0, 1 alpha,
squared alpha.

01:08:15.810 --> 01:08:19.819
So we conclude from that that 1
plus 1 plus alpha, which is

01:08:19.819 --> 01:08:22.190
alpha squared, plus alpha
squared is 0.

01:08:27.609 --> 01:08:32.020
So alpha is, in fact,
a root of this.

01:08:32.020 --> 01:08:36.859
And what about F of
alpha squared?

01:08:36.859 --> 01:08:41.100
Alpha squared squared is alpha
fourth, but we can

01:08:41.100 --> 01:08:44.229
reduce that mod 3 --

01:08:44.229 --> 01:08:45.520
the exponent mod 3.

01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:50.350
So this is alpha plus alpha
squared plus 1 and that is

01:08:50.350 --> 01:08:51.050
equal to 0.

01:08:51.050 --> 01:08:56.580
So alpha and alpha squared are
roots of this polynomial.

01:09:05.910 --> 01:09:28.859
There's a lovely fact proved
in the notes, which is that

01:09:28.859 --> 01:09:37.800
every element of --

01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:38.479
facts.

01:09:38.479 --> 01:09:52.660
Every element of F2 to the
M is a root of x 2

01:09:52.660 --> 01:09:54.790
to the M plus x.

01:10:01.330 --> 01:10:03.490
OK, did you see something
like this last time?

01:10:03.490 --> 01:10:05.025
I see some shaking of heads.

01:10:10.010 --> 01:10:11.260
OK.

01:10:13.210 --> 01:10:18.100
And how many roots could there
possibly be of x 2 to the M

01:10:18.100 --> 01:10:20.195
plus x by the fundamental
theorem of algebra?

01:10:20.195 --> 01:10:21.264
AUDIENCE: 2 to the M.

01:10:21.264 --> 01:10:28.520
PROFESSOR: 2 to the M. So
that means that x 2 to

01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:31.010
the M plus x --

01:10:31.010 --> 01:10:39.570
and for every root, it's got to
have a factor of the form x

01:10:39.570 --> 01:10:43.770
minus, or in this
case, plus beta.

01:10:43.770 --> 01:10:46.590
So this must have a complete
factorization of

01:10:46.590 --> 01:10:47.840
the following form.

01:10:53.750 --> 01:10:58.625
x 2 to the M plus x is simply
the product of x minus beta.

01:11:02.370 --> 01:11:03.620
All right.

01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:11.190
In fact, you can see that
0 a root, obviously.

01:11:11.190 --> 01:11:15.150
1 is a root, obviously.

01:11:15.150 --> 01:11:20.730
And we've checked up here.

01:11:20.730 --> 01:11:22.350
Let's see, what are
we interested in?

01:11:22.350 --> 01:11:24.070
Here's another example.

01:11:24.070 --> 01:11:28.770
x to the fourth plus
1, f of --

01:11:28.770 --> 01:11:32.800
if we have g of x equals x to
the four -- sorry -- plus x,

01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:38.620
then g of alpha is alpha to
the fourth plus alpha.

01:11:38.620 --> 01:11:43.220
But alpha to the fourth is equal
to alpha, so that's 0.

01:11:43.220 --> 01:11:47.450
g to the alpha squared
equals alpha to the

01:11:47.450 --> 01:11:50.400
8th plus alpha squared.

01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:53.570
Alpha to the 8th is alpha to the
fifth is alpha squared, so

01:11:53.570 --> 01:11:55.140
that equals 0.

01:11:55.140 --> 01:11:59.095
So, in fact, that's true
for that case.

01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:38.450
Every irreducible polynomial g
of x and F2 of x whose degree

01:12:38.450 --> 01:12:45.555
g of x divides 2 to the M --

01:12:54.440 --> 01:12:56.350
is that right?

01:12:56.350 --> 01:13:01.225
This may be 2 to
the M minus --

01:13:05.230 --> 01:13:06.990
I think it's whose degree
divides M --

01:13:11.290 --> 01:13:23.605
is a factor of x to the 2M
plus x in F2 to the x.

01:13:29.910 --> 01:13:32.580
OK.

01:13:32.580 --> 01:13:37.930
So let's give you an
example again.

01:13:37.930 --> 01:13:41.220
Example M equals 2.

01:13:41.220 --> 01:13:44.170
This means, what are the
irreducible polynomials whose

01:13:44.170 --> 01:13:45.420
degrees divide 2?

01:13:48.300 --> 01:13:59.320
The prime polynomials of degree
1 certainly divides to

01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:03.890
our x and x plus 1.

01:14:03.890 --> 01:14:08.240
Do they divide x to
the fourth plus 1?

01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:09.490
Yeah, they do.

01:14:13.390 --> 01:14:17.910
How many prime polynomials
are there of degree 2?

01:14:17.910 --> 01:14:23.080
There's only one, x squared
plus x plus 1.

01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:29.720
And if you divide it out into
x to the fourth plus 1, it

01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:30.970
goes evenly.

01:14:33.380 --> 01:14:42.610
It turns out that what this
implies is that this is

01:14:42.610 --> 01:14:45.410
actually an if or only if.

01:14:45.410 --> 01:14:50.990
A polynomial g of x divides x
to 2 to the M plus x if and

01:14:50.990 --> 01:14:56.940
only if g of x has a degree
which divides M and g of x is

01:14:56.940 --> 01:14:59.020
irreducible.

01:14:59.020 --> 01:15:12.120
So this implies that x to the
M plus x factors in F2 of x

01:15:12.120 --> 01:15:25.010
into the product of all
irreducible polynomials whose

01:15:25.010 --> 01:15:32.780
degrees divide M. And I think
you did a homework problem

01:15:32.780 --> 01:15:36.710
that used this, even though it
was never proved in class.

01:15:36.710 --> 01:15:38.180
So you at least read about it.

01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:45.430
Again, for this example, that
should mean that x to the

01:15:45.430 --> 01:15:51.880
fourth plus 1 equals x times
x plus 1 times x

01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:54.450
squared plus x plus 1.

01:15:54.450 --> 01:15:55.700
Is that true?

01:15:58.510 --> 01:16:00.320
Pretty easy to see that it is.

01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:03.130
x plus 1 times x squared
plus x plus 1 is just

01:16:03.130 --> 01:16:05.440
x cubed plus 1.

01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:06.470
Multiply by x --

01:16:06.470 --> 01:16:08.420
I'm sorry, this x
fourth plus x.

01:16:08.420 --> 01:16:10.970
How many times have
I done this?

01:16:10.970 --> 01:16:14.642
Should be x to the
fourth plus x.

01:16:14.642 --> 01:16:17.390
Yes.

01:16:17.390 --> 01:16:19.610
OK, it's kind of miracle
when you first see it.

01:16:19.610 --> 01:16:26.950
This works over any field for
any PNM again, lest you get

01:16:26.950 --> 01:16:28.200
this kind of factorization.

01:16:30.740 --> 01:16:36.210
OK, but now, comparing this to
this, what does that mean?

01:16:36.210 --> 01:16:42.290
That means this is one
factorization.

01:16:42.290 --> 01:16:45.520
This is in --

01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:48.050
we can do a complete
factorization in

01:16:48.050 --> 01:16:50.400
F2 to the M of x.

01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:55.470
We can only do complete in the
sense that we reduce it to a

01:16:55.470 --> 01:16:58.350
product of degree
1 polynomials.

01:16:58.350 --> 01:17:02.790
In F2 of x, we can't do a
complete factorization.

01:17:02.790 --> 01:17:06.600
This is similar to, over the
complex field you can always

01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:12.250
completely factor a polynomial
into one-dimensional

01:17:12.250 --> 01:17:15.460
polynomials of this form, where
beta is the set of roots

01:17:15.460 --> 01:17:16.900
of the polynomial.

01:17:16.900 --> 01:17:21.910
Whereas over the real field,
you might have to have some

01:17:21.910 --> 01:17:24.370
degree 2 polynomials in there.

01:17:24.370 --> 01:17:26.340
This is exactly analogous.

01:17:26.340 --> 01:17:28.660
You can't get complete

01:17:28.660 --> 01:17:33.450
factorization over this subfield.

01:17:33.450 --> 01:17:34.700
But what does it mean?

01:17:34.700 --> 01:17:37.890
Here we have a polynomial of
degree 4, has 4 roots.

01:17:37.890 --> 01:17:39.640
We factor like this.

01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:43.380
So each of these factors must
contain a number of roots

01:17:43.380 --> 01:17:45.670
equal to its degree.

01:17:45.670 --> 01:17:47.280
So what are the roots?

01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:51.170
This is the polynomial
that has root 0.

01:17:51.170 --> 01:17:53.710
This is the polynomial
that has root 1.

01:17:53.710 --> 01:17:56.710
As we just showed, this is the
polynomial that has the roots

01:17:56.710 --> 01:17:59.074
alpha and alpha squared, OK?

01:18:01.650 --> 01:18:05.290
So it's always going to
turn out that way.

01:18:05.290 --> 01:18:14.430
So you can group the field
elements into subsets where

01:18:14.430 --> 01:18:19.090
each subset is the set of roots
of some irreducible

01:18:19.090 --> 01:18:25.480
binary polynomial of some degree
that divides M, OK?

01:18:25.480 --> 01:18:29.390
These are called cyclotomic
subsets.

01:18:29.390 --> 01:18:31.570
Whence the name of Elwyn
Berlekamp's company,

01:18:31.570 --> 01:18:32.820
Cyclotomics.

01:18:35.630 --> 01:18:36.090
All right.

01:18:36.090 --> 01:18:41.100
So this is where, I think, the
theory gets just absolutely

01:18:41.100 --> 01:18:44.350
lovely and unexpected, at
least when you start in.

01:18:44.350 --> 01:18:46.950
And people who have a taste for
these things, I encourage

01:18:46.950 --> 01:18:50.120
you to read a real book
on the subject.

01:18:50.120 --> 01:18:53.340
Berlekamp's is one of
the most elegant.

01:18:53.340 --> 01:18:54.280
But there are lots --

01:18:54.280 --> 01:18:56.660
because it's an elegant subject,
there are lots of

01:18:56.660 --> 01:18:59.560
elegant treatments of it.

01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:01.590
All right.

01:19:01.590 --> 01:19:03.520
So remember what we
were trying to do

01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:04.480
in the first place.

01:19:04.480 --> 01:19:13.510
We were trying to find the
dimension of BCH codes.

01:19:13.510 --> 01:19:15.120
So where are we now?

01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:25.960
We've defined a BCH code as
the set of all binary

01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:39.270
polynomials with roots alpha up
to alpha to the n minus k

01:19:39.270 --> 01:19:43.760
where n and k are the parameters
of the parent

01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:44.760
Reed-Solomon code.

01:19:44.760 --> 01:19:47.618
And alpha is in the
parent field.

01:19:47.618 --> 01:19:50.250
So alpha in

01:19:50.250 --> 01:19:55.920
F2 to the M. OK.

01:19:55.920 --> 01:19:58.835
One final fact, I guess,
we need to know here.

01:20:01.415 --> 01:20:05.850
All right, if alpha is a
root -- now I'm talking

01:20:05.850 --> 01:20:08.540
about any field --

01:20:08.540 --> 01:20:13.160
then alpha squared is a root
of a binary polynomial.

01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:22.160
And again, this is due to a
very lovely fact, which is

01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:29.090
that squaring is linear in
fields of characteristic 2.

01:20:29.090 --> 01:20:31.045
Why is squaring linear.

01:20:31.045 --> 01:20:33.530
A little side calculation.

01:20:33.530 --> 01:20:38.410
a plus b squared equals a
squared plus 2ab plus b

01:20:38.410 --> 01:20:41.340
squared but characteristic 2.

01:20:41.340 --> 01:20:43.450
We can wipe that out.

01:20:43.450 --> 01:20:54.240
So in general, f of x quantity
squared is f of x squared.

01:20:58.120 --> 01:21:03.520
And that's why, if f of x
evaluates to 0, then f of x

01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:09.740
squared must evaluate to 0
since 0 squared is always

01:21:09.740 --> 01:21:11.910
equal to 0.

01:21:11.910 --> 01:21:12.360
All right.

01:21:12.360 --> 01:21:17.330
So alpha is a root if and only
if alpha squared is a root.

01:21:17.330 --> 01:21:18.380
Is that true here?

01:21:18.380 --> 01:21:18.900
Yes.

01:21:18.900 --> 01:21:20.460
Alpha alpha squared.

01:21:20.460 --> 01:21:23.080
Well, is it also true if we
squared alpha squared?

01:21:23.080 --> 01:21:25.430
What is the square
of alpha squared?

01:21:25.430 --> 01:21:27.800
It's back to alpha, all right?

01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:36.720
So these sets now turn out to be
cyclotomic cosets, they're

01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:39.130
called, which is the set of all

01:21:39.130 --> 01:21:41.740
elements and their squares.

01:21:41.740 --> 01:21:46.360
We get alpha, alpha squared,
alpha fourth, alpha eighth.

01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:48.170
And then, at some point,
it cycles.

01:21:48.170 --> 01:21:49.420
Why?

01:21:49.420 --> 01:21:51.620
Because what does alpha
to the 2M equal?

01:21:51.620 --> 01:21:52.552
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:21:52.552 --> 01:21:55.820
PROFESSOR: No.

01:21:55.820 --> 01:21:56.710
Alpha.

01:21:56.710 --> 01:21:57.120
Right.

01:21:57.120 --> 01:22:01.350
Alpha to the 2M minus 1 is 1,
so alpha to the 2M is alpha.

01:22:01.350 --> 01:22:05.680
So it comes back to alpha
again because of that.

01:22:05.680 --> 01:22:08.670
So we get a finite number of
roots which, of course, are

01:22:08.670 --> 01:22:10.810
equal to the degree here.

01:22:10.810 --> 01:22:13.306
In some cases, it's fewer.

01:22:13.306 --> 01:22:14.830
It's whatever the degree is.

01:22:14.830 --> 01:22:23.980
It's d, which divides M.

01:22:23.980 --> 01:22:27.360
So from this, we
simply start --

01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:30.930
suppose we want alpha
to be a root.

01:22:30.930 --> 01:22:36.180
Let's start with high
rate codes.

01:22:36.180 --> 01:22:44.140
I think here in the example,
in the text, I used F16.

01:22:44.140 --> 01:22:47.860
F16 is going to have --

01:22:47.860 --> 01:22:54.110
the elements of F16 are going
to be the roots of all the

01:22:54.110 --> 01:22:59.830
degree 1, 2, and 4 polynomials
because M is 4 and these are

01:22:59.830 --> 01:23:01.320
the degrees that divide 4.

01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:11.300
So again, we get x and x plus
1, which have roots 0 and 1.

01:23:11.300 --> 01:23:15.720
We get x squared
plus x plus 1.

01:23:15.720 --> 01:23:19.870
What are the roots of x squared
plus x plus 1 and F16?

01:23:19.870 --> 01:23:22.520
There are only going to be two
of them and they've got to

01:23:22.520 --> 01:23:28.770
have the property that if we
start with the first one,

01:23:28.770 --> 01:23:32.300
let's call it beta
and beta squared.

01:23:32.300 --> 01:23:34.640
Beta fourth has got to
equal beta because we

01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:36.960
only have two of them.

01:23:36.960 --> 01:23:43.040
That more or less forces beta
to be alpha to the fifth or

01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:45.410
alpha to the tenth.

01:23:45.410 --> 01:23:48.300
Let's see if that works.

01:23:48.300 --> 01:23:51.680
We get alpha to the fifth,
alpha to the tenth.

01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:54.400
Square that, we get
alpha to the 20th.

01:23:54.400 --> 01:23:57.770
But we now take the exponents
mod 15 and we get

01:23:57.770 --> 01:24:00.440
5 again, all right?

01:24:00.440 --> 01:24:04.350
So those are the two
roots of x squared

01:24:04.350 --> 01:24:05.990
plus x plus 1 in F16.

01:24:09.220 --> 01:24:10.920
Obviously, I'm not --

01:24:10.920 --> 01:24:13.340
I guess that was a legitimate
proof, but it

01:24:13.340 --> 01:24:15.810
was certainly quick.

01:24:15.810 --> 01:24:18.690
OK, there are three polynomials
of degree 4.

01:24:18.690 --> 01:24:22.850
By the way, I think you can
imagine how, given this

01:24:22.850 --> 01:24:27.210
result, we can now
enumerate the

01:24:27.210 --> 01:24:29.450
polynomials of each degree.

01:24:29.450 --> 01:24:31.300
We now have an expression.

01:24:35.350 --> 01:24:40.360
There are two irreducible
polynomials of degree 1.

01:24:40.360 --> 01:24:43.290
So how many more of degree 2
is it going to take to make

01:24:43.290 --> 01:24:44.770
the overall degree 4?

01:24:44.770 --> 01:24:45.560
One of them.

01:24:45.560 --> 01:24:47.160
So we're looking
for a single --

01:24:47.160 --> 01:24:48.870
there must be a single
irreducible

01:24:48.870 --> 01:24:50.620
polynomial degree 4.

01:24:50.620 --> 01:24:54.150
Similarly over here, all right,
we've accounted for

01:24:54.150 --> 01:24:56.640
four of the elements of F16.

01:24:56.640 --> 01:24:59.810
The only other possible degree
we could have is 4.

01:24:59.810 --> 01:25:03.320
So how many irreducible
polynomials are there of

01:25:03.320 --> 01:25:07.460
degree 4 over in F 2 of x?

01:25:07.460 --> 01:25:08.320
Must be three of them.

01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:11.240
And it always works out.

01:25:11.240 --> 01:25:14.330
So, from this you can get a
closed-form combinatorial

01:25:14.330 --> 01:25:18.720
formula again in terms of the
Mobius inversion formula.

01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:22.740
By doing a sieve or by some
other method, you can find out

01:25:22.740 --> 01:25:31.840
that the three irreducible
polynomials of degree 4 are

01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:36.850
those three and the
corresponding roots

01:25:36.850 --> 01:25:38.580
for this one --

01:25:38.580 --> 01:25:41.790
if this is the irreducible
polynomial you use to define

01:25:41.790 --> 01:25:45.100
the field, then alpha is a root
of it and you're going to

01:25:45.100 --> 01:25:49.060
get alpha, alpha squared,
alpha fourth,

01:25:49.060 --> 01:25:50.560
alpha to the eightth.

01:25:50.560 --> 01:25:53.110
Alpha to the eightth squared is
alpha to the 16th, but that

01:25:53.110 --> 01:25:55.240
equals alpha, OK?

01:25:55.240 --> 01:25:58.670
So these are the roots
of that equation.

01:25:58.670 --> 01:25:59.920
Here you get --

01:26:02.740 --> 01:26:06.940
sorry, x fourth plus x third
plus 1, since that's basically

01:26:06.940 --> 01:26:12.060
the reverse of this, turns out
you get alpha to the minus 1,

01:26:12.060 --> 01:26:16.070
which is alpha to the 1fourth.

01:26:16.070 --> 01:26:19.860
Square that and you get alpha to
the minus 2, which is alpha

01:26:19.860 --> 01:26:22.950
to the 13th, or equivalently,
alpha to the 28 --

01:26:22.950 --> 01:26:25.320
reduces to thirteen.

01:26:25.320 --> 01:26:28.980
This becomes alpha the 11th,
alpha to the seventh.

01:26:28.980 --> 01:26:30.730
and then alpha to the seventh
gives you alpha

01:26:30.730 --> 01:26:31.930
to the 1fourth again.

01:26:31.930 --> 01:26:33.898
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:26:33.898 --> 01:26:39.310
same thing about taking the
square [INAUDIBLE]?

01:26:39.310 --> 01:26:40.294
PROFESSOR: Correct.

01:26:40.294 --> 01:26:41.770
AUDIENCE: --from the
[INAUDIBLE]?

01:26:41.770 --> 01:26:45.390
PROFESSOR: Because you go
around in a circle.

01:26:45.390 --> 01:26:47.090
So it's a finite set.

01:26:47.090 --> 01:26:51.160
So you can obviously
divide by 2.

01:26:51.160 --> 01:26:54.840
So there's one cyclotomic
coset.

01:26:54.840 --> 01:26:56.540
Here's the second one.

01:26:56.540 --> 01:26:58.960
And then the third one must
be whatever's left over.

01:26:58.960 --> 01:26:59.710
What's left over?

01:26:59.710 --> 01:27:02.040
We don't have alpha
to the third yet.

01:27:02.040 --> 01:27:07.680
Alpha to the third, alpha to the
sixth, alpha to the 12th,

01:27:07.680 --> 01:27:11.740
and then alpha to the 2fourth,
which is alpha to the ninth.

01:27:11.740 --> 01:27:15.558
And alpha to the 18th is equal
alpha to the third again.

01:27:18.190 --> 01:27:21.120
OK, what's the moral of this?

01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:23.660
We want to start off with --

01:27:23.660 --> 01:27:25.850
let's just take a look
at the Reed-Solomon,

01:27:25.850 --> 01:27:27.380
the very first one.

01:27:27.380 --> 01:27:31.680
We just want n minus k to be 1
and we just want to have root

01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:34.695
alpha in here.

01:27:34.695 --> 01:27:38.660
Well, if we get root alpha,
we're going to get root alpha

01:27:38.660 --> 01:27:45.070
squared, alpha fourth and alpha
eightth along with it.

01:27:45.070 --> 01:27:47.940
If we want a binary polynomial
with root alpha,

01:27:47.940 --> 01:27:49.065
it has to this one.

01:27:49.065 --> 01:27:52.250
And it's going to
have four roots.

01:27:52.250 --> 01:27:52.700
All right.

01:27:52.700 --> 01:28:05.370
So for root alpha, we're going
to get x fourth plus x plus 1

01:28:05.370 --> 01:28:07.840
as our generator polynomial.

01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:09.260
And it's actually going
to have roots

01:28:09.260 --> 01:28:11.190
alpha and alpha squared.

01:28:11.190 --> 01:28:13.540
So it's going to be the same
one as you would get if you

01:28:13.540 --> 01:28:15.860
wanted alpha and
alpha squared.

01:28:15.860 --> 01:28:23.700
That means n minus k is already
up to 2, which means

01:28:23.700 --> 01:28:26.900
your distance is already
up to 3.

01:28:26.900 --> 01:28:29.760
Distance is n minus k plus 1.

01:28:29.760 --> 01:28:36.630
So this leads to a code
with n equals 16 --

01:28:36.630 --> 01:28:37.850
is that right?

01:28:37.850 --> 01:28:39.100
Yes.

01:28:40.920 --> 01:28:45.420
BCH codes are always defined
to be one shorter.

01:28:45.420 --> 01:28:58.660
We're going to have four
redundant bits, so k equals 12

01:28:58.660 --> 01:29:01.530
and distance equals 3.

01:29:04.530 --> 01:29:06.113
I think that's not
quite right.

01:29:11.430 --> 01:29:16.490
When we're doing BCH codes,
they're always defined just on

01:29:16.490 --> 01:29:20.630
the non-zero elements
of the field.

01:29:20.630 --> 01:29:28.090
So we start with the shorter
Read-Solomon code of

01:29:28.090 --> 01:29:30.960
length q minus 1.

01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:32.940
15 in this case rather
than 16.

01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:41.530
And 0 never appears here as
one of the possible roots.

01:29:41.530 --> 01:29:42.900
So let me just do that.

01:29:42.900 --> 01:29:46.170
I apologize I haven't
carried through all

01:29:46.170 --> 01:29:48.110
the possible steps.

01:29:48.110 --> 01:29:52.000
So we're getting all of the
polynomial multiples of x

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:57.230
fourth plus x plus 1 of degree
less or equal to

01:29:57.230 --> 01:29:59.560
14 rather than 15.

01:29:59.560 --> 01:30:01.610
So it's n equals 15.

01:30:01.610 --> 01:30:05.610
n minus k is going to be 4.

01:30:05.610 --> 01:30:07.220
So this is 11.

01:30:07.220 --> 01:30:11.280
And the distance is going to
be greater than equal to 3.

01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:13.160
In fact, it is 3.

01:30:13.160 --> 01:30:18.160
So it's a 15, 11, 3
code, which is, in

01:30:18.160 --> 01:30:20.040
fact, the Hamming code.

01:30:20.040 --> 01:30:20.450
Yes?

01:30:20.450 --> 01:30:21.350
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:30:21.350 --> 01:30:24.110
PROFESSOR: Oh, I'm sorry.

01:30:24.110 --> 01:30:27.080
Wasn't this fun?

01:30:27.080 --> 01:30:28.592
You're supposed to
do that, Ashish.

01:30:28.592 --> 01:30:29.476
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:30:29.476 --> 01:30:34.420
PROFESSOR: OK, well, so you
can see how it goes.

01:30:34.420 --> 01:30:37.770
So this gets us both roots
alpha and alpha squared.

01:30:37.770 --> 01:30:42.540
If we want alpha third and alpha
fourth, we already have

01:30:42.540 --> 01:30:45.000
alpha fourth from
this polynomial.

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:49.800
So all we need is this one,
which gets us another.

01:30:49.800 --> 01:30:55.166
And that gives us an n equals
15, k equals 7, d greater than

01:30:55.166 --> 01:31:01.170
or equal to 5, which, in fact,
is a 15, 7, 5 code.

01:31:01.170 --> 01:31:03.620
So we get additional codes.

01:31:03.620 --> 01:31:06.130
There's a table in there that
shows you that most the time

01:31:06.130 --> 01:31:09.790
for short block lengths for
distances which are equal to a

01:31:09.790 --> 01:31:12.060
prime power, we get the
same parameters

01:31:12.060 --> 01:31:13.320
as Reed-Muller codes.

01:31:13.320 --> 01:31:16.070
For lengths 64 and higher,
sometimes we do

01:31:16.070 --> 01:31:17.300
a little bit better.

01:31:17.300 --> 01:31:21.560
In addition, we get a lot more
codes for every, basically,

01:31:21.560 --> 01:31:24.740
odd distance when you take the
length odd or even distance if

01:31:24.740 --> 01:31:26.300
you take the length even.

01:31:30.010 --> 01:31:32.670
And that's definitely an asset,
that you have a larger

01:31:32.670 --> 01:31:34.620
number of codes to
choose from.

01:31:34.620 --> 01:31:38.210
So there's no doubt that in
terms n, k, d, BCH is the

01:31:38.210 --> 01:31:42.480
larger and, for longer block
length, slightly better class

01:31:42.480 --> 01:31:43.750
than Reed-Muller codes.

01:31:43.750 --> 01:31:46.110
But as I said before, in terms
of performance versus

01:31:46.110 --> 01:31:48.450
complexity, Reed-Muller
might still be the

01:31:48.450 --> 01:31:49.730
ones you want to use.

01:31:49.730 --> 01:31:50.220
OK.

01:31:50.220 --> 01:31:52.640
Good luck in the review and
good luck in the exam.

01:31:52.640 --> 01:31:53.890
I will see you Wednesday.
