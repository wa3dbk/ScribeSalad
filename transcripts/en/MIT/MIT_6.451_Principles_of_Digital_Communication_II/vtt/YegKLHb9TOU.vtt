[WRITING ON CHALKBOARD]

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:38.442
PROFESSOR: Good morning.

00:01:38.442 --> 00:01:44.780
I think I'll start even though
people are not quite all here,

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.030
because it's time.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.990
Sorry, I'd hoped to start
Chapter 10 last time, but

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.550
we'll start it this time.

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.600
When Ashish comes, we'll have
handouts for Chapter 10, the

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.280
new problem set and the
old problem set

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.800
solutions as usual.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:10.630
This chapter is about trellis
diagrams for block codes.

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.330
Binary linear block codes of
the kind that we've seen

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.800
before, it's actually a much
more general notion that

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.990
applies to --

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.360
well, linearity is important,
although we don't see it very

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.090
specifically in the
trellis diagram.

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.280
But we'll see that for
constructing a unique minimal

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.650
trellis, linearity is
an important aspect.

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.580
Or more generally, it's just
the group property of codes

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.470
that allows us to
construct unique

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.170
minimal trellis diagrams.

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.930
And I think it's best
to motivate this

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.820
chapter by an example.

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:52.580
Here's a nice example of a code
that we know very well.

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.620
It has a nice trellis diagram.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.075
It's the 8, 4, 4 Reed-Muller
code.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.890
Just to remind you of how we
construct this code, or one of

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:04.450
the methods.

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.160
We have many methods.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.920
We take this kind of universal
eight by eight --

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.010
well, it's a list
of eight tuples.

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.420
And it's the tensor product
of this little

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.710
matrix three times.

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:24.770
And if we create this, we get a
matrix that looks like that.

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:29.310
And we just pick the rows that
have weight four or greater,

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.780
and they are the generators of
the 8, 4, 4 Reed-Muller code.

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.520
So we'll take those as our
set of generators.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.040
It's the 16 code words generated
by these four

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.980
generators here.

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.780
This goes back to the first part
of the term, but I hope

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.790
you recall that fairly
quickly.

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.200
Now I'd like to draw a trellis
diagram for this code.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.600
I don't particularly
know why yet.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.490
One idea I might have in mind
is to do a Viterbi algorithm

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:02.080
decoding as a maximum likelihood
decoding algorithm

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.290
for this code.

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:04.920
So let's see if I can
come up with an

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.130
efficient trellis diagram.

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.190
That means one that first
of all has really

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:11.190
few states in it.

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.450
Relatively few branches would be
efficient as a decoding map

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:16.709
for the Viterbi algorithm.

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.180
And here's a very nice one.

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.920
This looks sort of
like a rate 1/2

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.540
four-state trellis diagram.

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.710
Of course, it's not
time-invariant, doesn't go on

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.730
forever like for a convolutional
code, for a

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:33.950
block code.

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.950
Block code only exists
over a finite time.

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:40.530
So we're going to get a block
trellis that starts at a

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.600
particular time, that
ends at a particular

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.520
time in a single state.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.460
But we want the basic
property that the --

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.320
the paths in this trellis are
in one-to-one correspondence

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.350
with the words in the code.

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.460
So, how many words are
there in the code?

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.620
There are 16 in this code.

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.690
How many paths are there
through this trellis?

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.270
Well, again it has a very
regular structure.

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.320
There is a four-way
branch here.

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.710
Wherever you get to, you have
a two-way branch here.

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.530
You have a two-way
branch here.

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.000
You have no choice here.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.330
So there are 16 possible ways
to get through this trellis,

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.320
16 trajectories if you like.

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.690
And next let's check if they
correspond to all the possible

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:25.510
code words.

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:30.590
Here is the all 0 code
word up here.

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:31.580
What's next?

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.140
Let's check for the
generators.

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:38.300
Here is one of the generators,
1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0.

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.440
And it's a 1, 1, 0, 0.

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.580
This is 1, 1 also.

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:45.830
1, 1 --

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:50.430
no, I'm sorry.

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:53.390
1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0.

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:53.960
That's right.

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.590
That's this one going
through here.

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:00.080
And 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0.

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.290
That's here.

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:04.230
And what's the last one?

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:05.060
All ones.

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.050
Well, that's up here too.

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:10.190
The all one path.

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:10.520
Yeah.

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.755
AUDIENCE: How did you know
whether to make the

00:06:12.755 --> 00:06:14.580
[INAUDIBLE] procedure?

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:15.980
PROFESSOR: I had side
information.

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:19.390
A genie told me.

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:21.500
I know that this is an
efficient trellis.

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:28.200
Where we'll get to, and I hope
today in this lecture, is a

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.460
turn-the-crank method of
constructing not only a

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.570
trellis, but the minimal
possible trellis.

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:37.690
So you'll be able to see how
starting from a set of four

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:41.020
generators like this, turn the
crank, and I'll produce a

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:43.500
trellis for you.

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:45.170
But of course you don't
see that yet.

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:46.800
I just know that this
is a trellis,

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.420
and it's a nice trellis.

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:50.890
It has nice, regular
structure.

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:53.680
You could decode this with a
Viterbi algorithm, and you

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:57.750
could see the complexity would
be comparable to the

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:01.700
complexity of decoding
a rate 1/2 four-state

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:03.210
convolutional code.

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:07.860
And in fact, you remember I
compared our example rate 1/2

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:10.900
four-state convolutional code
which had a coding gain of 4

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:15.270
dB with this code saying they
roughly have the same

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:15.970
complexity.

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:19.360
And when I said that, this is
what I had in mind, that I

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.700
could decode each of them with
a Viterbi algorithm with

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:25.570
approximately the same
amount of complexity.

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:29.000
And unfortunately this only has
a nominal coding gain of 3

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.710
dB, and an effective
coding gain of

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:33.890
slightly less than that.

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:37.410
So it's not quite as good as
the convolutional code.

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:39.340
And at the end of the day, we're
going to find out that

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:42.190
that's kind of typical of a
comparison between block and

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:46.080
convolutional codes of the
same trellis complexity.

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:49.870
But on the other hand, this is
certainly a better way to

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:55.260
decode this code, recursive by
the Viterbi algorithm, than to

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:59.360
do a full maximum likelihood
decoding of all 16 code words,

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:02.490
which involves just brute force
computing the distance

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:03.660
to 16 code words.

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:07.590
This is if you like a more
organized way of performing

00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:11.540
the computation of how far is
the receive sequence from each

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:12.790
of the 16 code words.

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:21.310
So the reason we look for
trellises of block codes is

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:23.980
first of all, it's better
than exhaustive

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:25.480
maximum likelihood decoding.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:29.030
It is a maximum likelihood
decoding algorithm since we're

00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:33.070
going to find that we can
construct a trellis for any

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:40.159
linear block code, which at
worst, it's never going to be

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:44.000
more complicated than just
enumerating all the code words

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.940
and doing exhaustive maximum
likelihood decoding.

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:49.760
And usually, as in this case,
it's going to be a more

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:53.440
efficient method of doing
maximum likelihood decoding.

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:56.310
So we will have a general method
of maximum likelihood

00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:58.310
decoding that is more
efficient than

00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:01.150
the exhaustive method.

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:02.400
Secondly, there's
an interesting

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.120
link to system theory.

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.670
I won't make a great deal
of this in this course.

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:09.000
But what are we really
doing here?

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:16.280
We're representing a block code
as a finite state system.

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:19.030
In fact, a linear block code
is a finite state linear

00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:21.980
system, although again the
linearity is not terribly

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:25.150
transparent from this picture.

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:29.510
So we have a linear finite state
system, just as we did

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:31.300
for the convolutional code.

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:34.045
However, it's necessarily
time varying.

00:09:34.045 --> 00:09:37.360
It couldn't possibly be shift
invariant because we only have

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:39.600
a finite time axis,
if you like.

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:44.220
Time axis only goes over four
time units in this particular

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:47.180
picture, where I've grouped
two outputs at a time.

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:57.190
So that's interesting, and for
our purposes an interesting

00:09:57.190 --> 00:10:02.940
aspect of this is that we now
get a notion of how complex is

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:04.920
a block code.

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:08.710
So far we've been focused on
parameters like n, k, d, which

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:13.670
are all algebraic parameters
of the code itself.

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:16.310
But we really want to know
about performance versus

00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:16.940
complexity.

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:19.540
So how complex is
the 8 4 4 code?

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:21.400
Well, now we have a little
bit of a handle on it.

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:27.730
We can say its complexity is
that of a four-state machine.

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:31.900
So trellis complexity gives us a
measure of the complexity of

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:35.330
a block code so that we can,
for instance, say the

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:38.955
Reed-Muller codes tend to be
less complex than PCH codes.

00:10:38.955 --> 00:10:41.120
And I'll try to give
some substance to

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:43.450
that as we go along.

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:46.110
So we get additional parameters
that have more to

00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:48.460
do with what we really care
about, which is decoding

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:51.050
complexity.

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:54.030
And finally, I introduce this
subject because it's a

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:58.270
stepping stone to where we're
really going, is this notion

00:10:58.270 --> 00:11:02.990
of codes on graphs, which is the
underlying concept for the

00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:07.510
capacity-approaching codes
that is our goal point.

00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:11.650
Our whole goal in this course
is to get to capacity,

00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:14.800
specifically on the additive
white Gaussian noise channel.

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:17.300
And the way that people have
found they get to capacity

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:20.690
turbo codes, low-density
parity check codes, the

00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:24.160
underlying concept that I'm
going to be framing that in is

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:25.680
codes on graphs.

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:30.950
And this is kind of a code on
a very elementary graph.

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:34.910
So it's a good way from
here to there.

00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:37.760
So that's why we're taking
a little time to

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:38.750
look at this subject.

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:42.600
Even though as I say, at the
end of the day, even though

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:44.780
there's a better way of decoding
block codes than the

00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:49.670
ways we've had previously, and a
better non-algebraic way, it

00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:52.480
still is not going to turn out
to be as good as convolutional

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:54.226
codes, which we already
know about.

00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:58.930
Any questions on what
we're doing,

00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:00.840
motivation and so forth?

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:01.788
Yeah.

00:12:01.788 --> 00:12:06.054
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
convolutional codes is that

00:12:06.054 --> 00:12:08.424
each node doesn't have two
things coming on to it?

00:12:08.424 --> 00:12:11.820
PROFESSOR: That's right, it's
a little bit more irregular,

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:15.270
and this trellis section
doesn't look the same.

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:18.210
We had a completely mixing
trellis section for the

00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:19.400
convolutional code.

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:24.160
This kind of divides it into two
halves which don't meet.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:29.300
This basically expresses the
code as a certain subcode, and

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:31.450
its coset is down here.

00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:33.200
So, it's not quite the same.

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:35.080
Looks different.

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:37.801
Maybe this will turn out
to be interesting.

00:12:37.801 --> 00:12:39.051
Good observation.

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:44.560
Anything else at this point?

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:46.352
AUDIENCE: You just said
that this is not a

00:12:46.352 --> 00:12:47.696
convolutional code.

00:12:47.696 --> 00:12:51.760
Or maybe we can have more than
one states, and it is a

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:54.030
convolutional code.

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:56.020
PROFESSOR: Let's see, it's
not a convolutional code.

00:12:56.020 --> 00:13:01.800
It's not even a terminated
convolutional code, because it

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:03.670
doesn't have the simple
shift register

00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:05.150
type of trellis diagram.

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:07.060
At least it's not the kind
of convolutional

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:09.380
code we know about.

00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:10.780
But why should it be?

00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:14.565
Let's open up our minds
to more possibilities.

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:20.810
We don't really care.

00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:25.300
The objective that we have in
mind here is we're just going

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:29.950
to try to come up with the most
efficient trellis picture

00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:32.560
that we can for block code.

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:37.020
And we're going to use the
linearity, and we're going to

00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:39.820
basically try to find
as few states as

00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:41.670
possible at each time.

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:44.370
That's going to be our measure
of efficiency.

00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:46.550
That's not the only one you
could think of, but it'll turn

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:51.330
out that any notion of efficient
representation comes

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:52.820
down to the same thing.

00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:55.750
So we'll focus on a minimal
state representation of a

00:13:55.750 --> 00:14:00.100
block code, and you can think
of this as an exercise in

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:01.570
system theory and minimal

00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:04.400
realizations of a linear system.

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:06.860
This you can view.

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:09.730
A set of all 16 code words you
can view is the set of

00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:14.160
possible trajectories of a
linear system on a time axis

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:18.610
of length 8, and we want to find
a minimal realization,

00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:22.100
minimal state realization
of that linear system.

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:25.660
So that'll make sense to some
of you, and it won't make an

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:27.040
awful lot of sense to
the rest of you.

00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:36.610
So we're after a minimal, in the
state sense, minimal state

00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:38.098
complexity, let's say.

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:47.180
And let's continue to focus on
this example, and let's focus

00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:48.745
on a particular time.

00:14:48.745 --> 00:14:53.790
Let's focus on the halfway
point here.

00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:56.330
Where do the state times
occur, by the way?

00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:59.100
They occur between
the symbol tags.

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:02.960
You can think of a state as
being associated with a cut

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:07.730
between a certain set of symbols
which we call the past

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:11.170
and another set of symbols
which we call the future,

00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:17.090
again using just some theoretic
temporal language.

00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:18.400
So if we make a cut --

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:22.420
let's say I do it over here.

00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:25.920
States are based on cuts between
a past and a future,

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:29.470
so the state actually occurs
between the fourth and the

00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:33.030
fifth symbol here, not at either
of them, if you want to

00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:37.330
draw where is the stated time.

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:39.960
And let's start with
this example.

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:45.040
And let's ask if we could find
any simpler trellis for this.

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:49.680
In other words, let's see if
we can have fewer than four

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:51.155
states at this midpoint.

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:56.330
Could we possibly have
fewer than four

00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:57.580
states at the midpoint?

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:07.420
What's the key property
of states?

00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:11.840
The key property of states is
that once you get to a state,

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:15.390
that then becomes a summary of
all the history that you know

00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:23.940
about the past, and any past
sequence or partial sequence

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:28.910
that gets you to this state has
to have the same set of

00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:33.440
possible continuations over here
in the future in order

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:37.740
for this to be a valid trellis
representation.

00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:41.750
So maybe it will help if I draw
this just focusing on the

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:42.690
central time.

00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:46.010
There are two ways to get
to this central time.

00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:49.450
One is to get to what
we call the 0 state.

00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:53.900
We can get there by 0, 0,
0, 0 or 1, 1, 1, 1.

00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:58.510
There's a second state which
we can get to again by two

00:16:58.510 --> 00:17:07.050
paths, which are 0, 0,
1, 1 or 1, 1, 0, 0.

00:17:07.050 --> 00:17:13.839
There's a third one, which we
can get to by 1, 0, 1, 0 or

00:17:13.839 --> 00:17:17.190
its complement, 0, 1, 0, 1.

00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:22.750
We'll see that each of these
involves a four-tuple and its

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:23.422
complement.

00:17:23.422 --> 00:17:29.070
And this is 1, 0, 0,
1 or 0, 1, 1, 0.

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:34.590
Those are the set of possible
past sequences that can get to

00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:36.620
any of these four states.

00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:39.410
There are two of them.

00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:44.910
Now what this trellis says
is that from this state,

00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:49.250
regardless of how we got here,
either of these two things,

00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:52.140
there are two possible
continuations, which happen to

00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:53.390
be the same thing.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.640
And the property state has to
be that either of these

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:05.580
continuations is a legitimate
continuation of either of the

00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:07.240
paths that it takes
to get there.

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:10.900
So we now have four possible
code words that go through

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:15.470
this particular state, that
pass through this state.

00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:20.560
And down here, similarly, I
think what we have is the same

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:23.370
set of code words.

00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:29.480
There's complete symmetry
and so forth.

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:34.550
Let's ask, could we combine
these two states, somehow

00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:36.985
smush them together into
a single state?

00:18:36.985 --> 00:18:41.880
And the answer is obviously no,
because 0, 0, 1, 1 is not

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:45.040
a continuation of the
all 0 sequence, or

00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:46.530
of the all 1 sequence.

00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:50.320
And 0, 0, 0, 0 is not a
continuation of the 0, 0, 1, 1

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:53.605
sequence or the 1,
1, 0, 0 sequence.

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:59.210
The property of the state
is the Markov property.

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:07.950
And there are many ways of
phrasing this, but this is the

00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:31.880
defining property of states, is
that if two past paths have

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:33.130
a future continuation --

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:40.040
I hope you understand this
language as I introduce it --

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:54.640
in common, then all
their future

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:56.150
continuations are in common.

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:15.890
So I have two past
paths, let's say.

00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:17.800
This is the definition
of states.

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:22.030
If we can find such a situation,
then we can say

00:20:22.030 --> 00:20:27.210
that these two past paths go
through the same state at the

00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:32.350
cut time, because then we
can smush them together.

00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:36.270
You can think of this as our
starting from, but suppose we

00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:41.080
drew all 16 code words,
and we drew a --

00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:45.350
here would be a 16 state
trellis, and the first two

00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:50.440
elements of it might be 0, 0,
0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1.

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:53.810
And we'd ask, can we smush these
two states together?

00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:58.870
And the answer is yes because
of this property, because 0,

00:20:58.870 --> 00:21:01.840
0, 0 can also be followed
by 1, 1, 1, 1.

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:03.960
There are actually four
states that we're

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:05.360
smushing together here.

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:11.850
1, 1, 1, 1 and 0, 0, 0.

00:21:11.850 --> 00:21:14.360
These are all legitimate code
words, and because they're all

00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:18.340
legitimate, we can basically
break this up into a Cartesian

00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:23.240
product of two paths with two
futures, and represent all

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:24.710
four of them by a
single state.

00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:27.300
So that's what states do.

00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:30.850
If we want a minimal state
diagram, we should do this as

00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:31.840
much as possible.

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:35.180
It's not very well-defined right
now, but we should merge

00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:38.870
states wherever this
property holds.

00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:45.330
So this implies they go through
a common state, and

00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:46.580
it's if and only if.

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:54.730
So you could see it
very concretely

00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:55.920
from the trellis diagram.

00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:58.890
This is the property
that we need.

00:21:58.890 --> 00:22:03.510
You can see that for this
particular code, we do have

00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:08.630
the possibility of combining
all 16 possible states here

00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:12.360
into 4, because we can
combine them all

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:14.380
pair-wise in this way.

00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:16.770
This is going to come from the
linear property of the code.

00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:20.208
That's why everything
is so symmetric.

00:22:20.208 --> 00:22:23.030
But we can't go any
further than that.

00:22:23.030 --> 00:22:30.282
So we can conclude from this is
that for the 8, 4, 4 code,

00:22:30.282 --> 00:22:40.620
the minimal state space
at the center has four

00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:47.900
states, has size four.

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:55.920
For simple code like this, you
can simply see what all the

00:22:55.920 --> 00:23:00.340
possibilities are, and this
is the best we can do.

00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:02.190
So do you get that?

00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:05.490
This is fundamental
system theory

00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:07.720
state realization theory.

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:09.620
I don't know where
in the curriculum

00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:11.650
one gets this nowadays.

00:23:11.650 --> 00:23:16.540
Probably somewhere over towards
the control side,

00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:21.280
maybe in digital signal
processing, but maybe not.

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:23.240
But we're doing system
theory here.

00:23:26.910 --> 00:23:28.768
We all get that?

00:23:28.768 --> 00:23:29.716
Yeah.

00:23:29.716 --> 00:23:30.664
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:30.664 --> 00:23:35.605
properties basically defined, I
have two possible paths, and

00:23:35.605 --> 00:23:37.887
they have one common
[INAUDIBLE]

00:23:37.887 --> 00:23:42.780
data, they have [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:46.040
PROFESSOR: Yeah, if they go
through a common state, that

00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:48.840
implies this statement.

00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:55.160
Conversely, if we have a set of
past paths and future paths

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:58.902
that have this property, then
we can define a state.

00:23:58.902 --> 00:24:01.530
In other words, states are
always going to look something

00:24:01.530 --> 00:24:04.840
like this, with a set
of past paths.

00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:11.520
We have a set of future paths,
and the state is simply a node

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:14.050
that they go through such that
you can combine any of these

00:24:14.050 --> 00:24:15.710
paths with any of
these futures.

00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:18.100
If it's symmetric, you could
say the same thing.

00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:22.050
If two futures have a past in
common, then they have all

00:24:22.050 --> 00:24:23.740
their paths in common.

00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:28.430
But whenever you have a state
representation --

00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:31.770
let's suppose we have
three states there.

00:24:31.770 --> 00:24:35.530
Then this is what, just looking
at those states and

00:24:35.530 --> 00:24:39.000
the initial and final states,
this is what the code is going

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.250
to have to look like.

00:24:44.850 --> 00:24:50.180
Because property of state is
that however you got there,

00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:52.520
you have to be able to take
any of these over here.

00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:54.620
Otherwise the trellis
is invalid.

00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:57.720
If not all of these nine
sequences are code words, then

00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:00.370
it's not a valid trellis
representation, or

00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:04.590
equivalently, it's not a valid
state representation.

00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:08.690
So if, and only if, we
can draw the thing in

00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:11.090
this way, we get it.

00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:16.390
So for a small code, you can
just see how much combining

00:25:16.390 --> 00:25:18.400
you can do.

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:22.120
In particular, you can ask,
what can the 0, 0 state --

00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:25.210
0, 0 path sequence -- what can
that be combined with?

00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:38.160
Well, it can only be combined
with sequences that have a 0

00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:39.070
first part.

00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:43.180
So let me introduce now
the idea of subcodes.

00:25:50.960 --> 00:26:07.610
We have a linear code C. Let's
define an interval on the time

00:26:07.610 --> 00:26:13.540
axis: k, k prime, whatever.

00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:21.440
The subcode C on that interval
is the set of all code words.

00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:35.010
Elegant way to say it is whose
support is in k, k prime.

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:42.940
In other words, which are all
0 outside, which have all 0

00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:45.130
symbols outside of this
interval that we've

00:26:45.130 --> 00:26:46.410
identified.

00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:49.390
So that's just notation.

00:26:49.390 --> 00:26:55.350
So specifically, let's say the
past code with respect to a

00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:58.630
certain time, like the
midpoint there.

00:26:58.630 --> 00:27:04.450
Well, we can define that as the
set of all code words that

00:27:04.450 --> 00:27:08.020
are 0 outside the past, the
first four symbols, and we

00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:12.800
define the future subcode as the
set of all code words that

00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:14.400
are 0 outside the future.

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:16.620
For this code, what is that?

00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:18.630
We list the 16 code words.

00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:20.070
We make this the past.

00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:22.680
We make this the future.

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:28.700
What is the past subcode here?

00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:33.430
In this particular case, the
past subcode is, of course,

00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:34.380
the all 0 sequence.

00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:39.250
It was always in this code
or this sequence,

00:27:39.250 --> 00:27:41.110
1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0.

00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:44.690
It's a linear code of dimension
one, and it consists

00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:45.940
of these two code words.

00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:56.120
It is precisely the set of all
code words that can be

00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:59.450
followed by the all
0 sequence.

00:27:59.450 --> 00:28:03.060
So I can read it directly off of
this trellis picture here.

00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:07.510
So everybody with me?

00:28:07.510 --> 00:28:11.510
The past subcode just consists
of those two words.

00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:16.460
The future subcode consists
similarly.

00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:23.370
Looking at the trellis, it's the
1's that are all 0 outside

00:28:23.370 --> 00:28:24.310
the future.

00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:28.040
In other words, can follow
a past which is all 0.

00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:29.860
In other words, it's these
two code words.

00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:36.640
So here are two little
subcodes with a code.

00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:48.940
So by definition, this is
subcode of C. If C is linear,

00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:51.940
you can quickly convince
yourself this is a linear

00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:55.090
subcode, so it's going to have
a certain dimension.

00:28:55.090 --> 00:28:57.980
It's going to have size equal
to a power of two.

00:28:57.980 --> 00:29:00.950
It's even going to have a
minimum distance that is at

00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:03.750
least as great as the minimum
distance of C, because it

00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:07.560
consists of code words of C, so
its minimum non-zero weight

00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:12.040
is going to be at least as great
as that of C. So it has

00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:13.290
some properties immediately.

00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:23.450
These past and future codes seem
to have a lot to do with

00:29:23.450 --> 00:29:26.230
the structure of the
trellis up here.

00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:33.400
In fact, the zero state consists
of precisely --

00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:40.440
the sequences that go through
the zero state here are not

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:46.310
coincidentally the set of all
past code words in Cp followed

00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:49.740
by the set of all future
code words in Cf.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.100
And why is that?

00:29:57.100 --> 00:30:05.350
It's because the set of all
ways of getting to here,

00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:08.090
getting to this state, have
to be the set of all code

00:30:08.090 --> 00:30:12.770
sequences that can be followed
by the all 0 sequence.

00:30:12.770 --> 00:30:16.200
Similarly, the set of all
continuations from this state

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:18.190
have to be the set of
all continuations

00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:20.900
of the all 0 sequence.

00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:24.690
So the zero state is always
going to be a little

00:30:24.690 --> 00:30:28.660
sub-trellis that is going to
represent in effect --

00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:32.930
you can draw it as a sum, or
a product, of the past and

00:30:32.930 --> 00:30:34.000
future subcodes.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.690
In other words, there's a
two-dimensional code that has

00:30:38.690 --> 00:30:40.450
these two generators.

00:30:40.450 --> 00:30:44.600
g1, g2 generates a little
two-dimensional code.

00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:49.040
Here's the fourth code word in
it, the all 1 code sequence.

00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:52.970
And every element in that
two-dimensional code goes

00:30:52.970 --> 00:30:54.220
through the zero state.

00:30:56.922 --> 00:30:58.890
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:58.890 --> 00:30:59.874
code word.

00:30:59.874 --> 00:31:02.050
So then you know --

00:31:02.050 --> 00:31:03.890
PROFESSOR: It's whatever
it happens to be.

00:31:03.890 --> 00:31:07.110
AUDIENCE: Then you have a
separate state just for --

00:31:11.910 --> 00:31:14.150
you could combine them.

00:31:14.150 --> 00:31:15.930
PROFESSOR: It doesn't matter.

00:31:15.930 --> 00:31:20.780
Suppose that Cp has
dimension one.

00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:22.720
Cf has dimension one.

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:27.515
That means Cp is going to
be something like this.

00:31:30.810 --> 00:31:34.830
Cf is going to be something
like this.

00:31:34.830 --> 00:31:37.358
Whatever, what way.

00:31:37.358 --> 00:31:39.500
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:44.110
PROFESSOR: It just follows
from linearity.

00:31:44.110 --> 00:31:47.650
And clearly, since C itself was
linear, we're allowed to

00:31:47.650 --> 00:31:51.010
add x, x, x, x all 0's
to y, y, y, y.

00:31:51.010 --> 00:31:53.800
That's a code word, because
these were both code words in

00:31:53.800 --> 00:32:00.720
C. So the linearity allows you
to fill in this fourth corner

00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:04.410
of the rectangle, if you like.

00:32:04.410 --> 00:32:09.160
So Cp plus Cf is always going
to look like this.

00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:12.930
And we'll always call this the
zero state, the state that you

00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:15.330
get to by the all 0 sequence.

00:32:15.330 --> 00:32:18.580
And that can be followed
by the all 0 sequence.

00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:22.220
That's always going to be
called the zero state.

00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:24.620
By linearity, it's always
going to look like that.

00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:26.370
It might not be dimension one.

00:32:26.370 --> 00:32:27.650
It could have any
dimension here.

00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:36.920
So we're really beginning
to get somewhere now.

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:42.170
What do all these other states
look like, grouped

00:32:42.170 --> 00:32:43.420
theoretically?

00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:47.130
Cosets.

00:32:47.130 --> 00:32:49.730
Somebody -- who said cosets?

00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:53.010
Good, that's right.

00:32:53.010 --> 00:32:57.870
So Cp plus Cf is itself
a subcode of C, a

00:32:57.870 --> 00:33:00.530
two-dimensional subcode.

00:33:00.530 --> 00:33:07.050
So there are four cosets of Cp
plus Cf in C, and we'll see if

00:33:07.050 --> 00:33:09.385
they correspond to
the four states.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.080
So how do we do this
algebraically?

00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:24.645
Let's draw a generator matrix
for C in a certain form.

00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:33.670
Again, I'll draw the
past, the future.

00:33:33.670 --> 00:33:37.690
So that's the only division I'm
concerned with right now.

00:33:37.690 --> 00:33:42.990
And let me draw it in
general form first.

00:33:42.990 --> 00:33:47.860
I've defined this past subcode,
Cp, at a certain

00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:51.140
dimension, so it has a certain
number of generators.

00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:56.420
So we're going to put up here a
set of generators for Cp, g

00:33:56.420 --> 00:34:01.390
of Cp, however many there
happen to be.

00:34:01.390 --> 00:34:03.810
And what's their common
characteristic?

00:34:03.810 --> 00:34:08.935
They all are all 0
in the future.

00:34:08.935 --> 00:34:10.614
So they're all going
to look like that.

00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:22.690
Then I'm going to take a set
of generators of Cf, and

00:34:22.690 --> 00:34:27.480
similarly I'm going to use
them up over there.

00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:30.739
These are all code words, and
they're clearly linear and

00:34:30.739 --> 00:34:32.400
independent of those.

00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:34.630
So I'm on my way to constructing
a generator

00:34:34.630 --> 00:34:36.920
matrix for C.

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:40.750
But obviously I'm going
to need some more.

00:34:40.750 --> 00:34:44.600
We can call this the number of
generators in the past, the

00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:47.199
number of generators
in the future.

00:34:47.199 --> 00:34:49.699
This is the dimension of Cp.

00:34:49.699 --> 00:34:53.699
This is the dimension of Cf.

00:34:53.699 --> 00:34:57.490
And now I need some more
generators, which by

00:34:57.490 --> 00:35:00.435
definition are going to have to
span both past and future.

00:35:03.790 --> 00:35:06.240
Let's see.

00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:09.880
Since I've already introduced
the coset language, let me

00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:16.400
just mysteriously put that
as the generators

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:18.350
of a quotient group.

00:35:18.350 --> 00:35:25.150
C mod Cp and Cf is what that
means, and it's a quotient

00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:30.442
group, if you know or recall
what a quotient group is.

00:35:30.442 --> 00:35:35.790
But anyway, there are k minus
kp minus kf of these.

00:35:35.790 --> 00:35:38.440
And I don't particularly care
what I put down in here.

00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:40.480
Their property is that
they have to span

00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:44.070
both past and future.

00:35:44.070 --> 00:35:48.830
So for our particular example,
here's the generator for the

00:35:48.830 --> 00:35:52.250
8, 4, 4 code.

00:35:52.250 --> 00:35:55.590
What we're talking about is
a generator that looks

00:35:55.590 --> 00:35:58.390
like 1, 1, 1, 1.

00:35:58.390 --> 00:36:02.410
That's k past is 1.

00:36:02.410 --> 00:36:05.470
0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1.

00:36:05.470 --> 00:36:07.220
k future is 1.

00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:09.700
They're both one-dimensional
codes.

00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:14.150
Now I need two other generators,
which must span

00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:15.400
past and future.

00:36:17.690 --> 00:36:22.180
So what'll I take?

00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:26.020
Let me just take two more.

00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:32.675
1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1,
0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0.

00:36:32.675 --> 00:36:35.400
That would be one
possible choice.

00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:41.350
And so this is k minus kp
minus kf, which is 2.

00:36:53.250 --> 00:36:57.740
What I'm going to claim is that
I'm going to need a state

00:36:57.740 --> 00:37:00.510
for every possible linear
combination of these

00:37:00.510 --> 00:37:01.760
generators.

00:37:06.330 --> 00:37:07.580
So claim --

00:37:11.330 --> 00:37:16.880
well, let me break it down into
more logical sequence.

00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:27.020
Every code word in C can be
written as some linear

00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:30.020
combination of the generators.

00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:32.060
What does that amount to?

00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:40.010
It amounts to a certain code
word in the past code plus a

00:37:40.010 --> 00:37:43.540
certain component in the future
code, either all 0 or

00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:46.080
they're all one, plus --

00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:52.430
let me call this the state code,
S, as I do in the notes.

00:37:52.430 --> 00:37:55.410
So in this case we have a
two-dimensional state code.

00:37:55.410 --> 00:37:56.890
Its elements are eight-tuples.

00:37:56.890 --> 00:38:00.770
It's just a subcode of the code
we started with, so it's

00:38:00.770 --> 00:38:06.440
not quite clear how it
corresponds to states yet.

00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:10.340
Well, let me just call that
S for state sequence.

00:38:17.250 --> 00:38:22.730
And I claim I can break this up
because the proof is that

00:38:22.730 --> 00:38:29.240
for every c in C is equal
to a sum of --

00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:31.150
it's a linear combination
of the generators.

00:38:31.150 --> 00:38:34.480
So I just break that up into
the three possible parts.

00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:38.200
So I get one part that's in the
past subcode, one part's

00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:41.030
in the future subcode, and
one is in the state.

00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:45.260
So this is the past, this is the
future, this is the state.

00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:48.700
So I just break it up
according to this.

00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:51.760
So the 16 code words can all be
written in this way in our

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:53.010
particular example.

00:38:57.610 --> 00:39:03.346
So let's project this code
word on the past.

00:39:03.346 --> 00:39:04.955
What does projection mean?

00:39:04.955 --> 00:39:06.905
It means you just don't
look at the part

00:39:06.905 --> 00:39:08.470
that's in the future.

00:39:08.470 --> 00:39:10.350
So we're looking at
four-tuples now.

00:39:14.210 --> 00:39:19.970
So C projected on to the
past, this is the part

00:39:19.970 --> 00:39:22.964
that lives over here.

00:39:22.964 --> 00:39:26.840
It is equal to -- well, if I
project the past code word on

00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:32.840
the past, I basically get the
past code word again.

00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:35.385
Let me write it like that, but
it's a little bit redundant.

00:39:39.950 --> 00:39:45.160
Incidental comment: I can regard
this past subcode as

00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:51.940
either an 8 1 4 code, but
what is it really?

00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:53.230
It doesn't live out here.

00:39:53.230 --> 00:39:54.860
It's support is on these four.

00:39:54.860 --> 00:40:03.660
It's really a 4 1 4 repetition
code that lives on the past.

00:40:03.660 --> 00:40:06.070
It's support is the past.

00:40:06.070 --> 00:40:11.090
Similarly, the support here
is the future, and it's

00:40:11.090 --> 00:40:14.710
effectively a 4 1 4 repetition
code for our example.

00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:22.840
But formally, if we project
this on the past, it's a

00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:24.590
one-to-one projection.

00:40:24.590 --> 00:40:27.050
What happens to the
future part?

00:40:27.050 --> 00:40:30.480
This disappears, because the
projection of anything in the

00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:36.350
future code on the past is
all 0 by definition.

00:40:36.350 --> 00:40:39.360
Plus, it's the projection
of the state

00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:40.480
sequence on the past.

00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:42.340
Could the projection of
the state sequence on

00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:43.670
the past be all 0?

00:40:48.450 --> 00:40:50.000
This is actually an
important point.

00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:55.570
Could the the projection of
any linear combination of

00:40:55.570 --> 00:40:59.880
these generators down here
be all 0 in the past?

00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:01.920
The answer is no by
the definition

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:06.050
of the future subcode.

00:41:06.050 --> 00:41:08.180
If I found a linear combination
of this that was

00:41:08.180 --> 00:41:11.090
all 0 in the past, I should add
that to the generators of

00:41:11.090 --> 00:41:12.670
the future subcode.

00:41:12.670 --> 00:41:16.820
So by defining this in this way,
I've forced this to be

00:41:16.820 --> 00:41:21.260
nonzero, unless, of
course, the state

00:41:21.260 --> 00:41:22.840
sequence itself was 0.

00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:25.890
The all 0 sequence is
in the state code.

00:41:25.890 --> 00:41:28.940
So this is nonzero
if S is nonzero.

00:41:33.570 --> 00:41:36.530
And similarly, if I project
a code word on the

00:41:36.530 --> 00:41:38.480
future, I get --

00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:44.070
this becomes all 0.

00:41:44.070 --> 00:41:48.350
I get the element of the future
code projected on the

00:41:48.350 --> 00:41:53.190
future, plus the state on the
future, the state projected on

00:41:53.190 --> 00:41:54.440
the future.

00:42:00.569 --> 00:42:08.910
And now I claim further that
this means I can draw a

00:42:08.910 --> 00:42:10.230
trellis as follows.

00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:17.940
Start from here.

00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:22.860
For the all 0 sequence, I'll
have a bunch of parallel paths

00:42:22.860 --> 00:42:27.530
going to the zero state
that together add

00:42:27.530 --> 00:42:28.780
up to the past subcode.

00:42:31.610 --> 00:42:32.870
These are precise.

00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:37.450
One of these is going to be all
0, and these are precisely

00:42:37.450 --> 00:42:42.665
the ones over here that can be
followed by all 0, as I've

00:42:42.665 --> 00:42:43.915
already claimed.

00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:50.910
So these are the ones that
can be followed by 0, and

00:42:50.910 --> 00:42:53.930
similarly over here I'm going to
put all the future subcode.

00:42:59.140 --> 00:43:04.200
I will say these correspond
to the state sequence 0.

00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:08.450
These are the ones where if I
put 0 coefficients down here,

00:43:08.450 --> 00:43:11.890
I just get linear combinations
of the past subcode and the

00:43:11.890 --> 00:43:12.790
future subcode.

00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:14.810
I'm going to write those
as going through

00:43:14.810 --> 00:43:16.080
all one trellis state.

00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:18.620
And I believe I've already made
the argument that this

00:43:18.620 --> 00:43:25.010
state at least is legitimate,
that every combination of

00:43:25.010 --> 00:43:27.270
something in the past subcode
with something in the future

00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:29.360
subcode is a code word.

00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:34.340
This is simply just Cp plus
Cf, what I wrote before.

00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:37.320
So I've got one state that
represents all of Cp plus Cf.

00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:46.830
And now let's take another
typical state down here.

00:43:46.830 --> 00:43:49.130
We'll say this state corresponds
to the state

00:43:49.130 --> 00:43:54.970
sequence S, or S is a general
state sequence.

00:43:54.970 --> 00:43:57.320
Think of it as being nonzero.

00:43:57.320 --> 00:44:00.410
And what am I going
to put on that?

00:44:00.410 --> 00:44:04.820
I'm going to put Cp plus
this state sequence

00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:07.200
projected on the past.

00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:10.900
And that way I'll get all past
projections that are of this

00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:14.790
form for a specific S projected
on the past,

00:44:14.790 --> 00:44:17.820
allowing this to vary through
the past subcode.

00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:27.320
And similarly over here, I will
let the set of all these

00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:30.630
trellis branches be
Cf plus the state

00:44:30.630 --> 00:44:31.880
projected on the future.

00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:40.050
So all the things that go
through this state here will

00:44:40.050 --> 00:44:47.800
be Cp plus Cf plus this
particular state sequence.

00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:50.530
So for each of the state
sequences, I claim I can

00:44:50.530 --> 00:44:52.260
define a state.

00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:56.810
So it's the set of all past
continuations of anything that

00:44:56.810 --> 00:45:00.040
projects on the past as anything
in the past subcode

00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:04.750
plus a past projection of the
state sequence can be combined

00:45:04.750 --> 00:45:08.540
with anything in the future,
Cf plus the future

00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:11.730
continuation of the
state sequence.

00:45:11.730 --> 00:45:15.330
One of these is simply the past
projection of the state

00:45:15.330 --> 00:45:17.730
sequence plus the future
projection

00:45:17.730 --> 00:45:20.630
of the state sequence.

00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:25.210
And this is S, and by
construction this is a code

00:45:25.210 --> 00:45:27.630
word in the code.

00:45:27.630 --> 00:45:33.540
Now by linearity I can add any
past code word to this past

00:45:33.540 --> 00:45:35.920
projection.

00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:41.450
And that's a code word, so any
of these elements plus Sf,

00:45:41.450 --> 00:45:45.790
continued by Sf, the future
projection is a code word.

00:45:45.790 --> 00:45:49.540
See, there we're taking
something generated by Cp and

00:45:49.540 --> 00:45:52.400
the state code.

00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:55.500
And similarly, anything by
here comes out here.

00:45:55.500 --> 00:46:00.900
So I think I've left one or two
details undone, but are

00:46:00.900 --> 00:46:05.460
you convinced that I can define
a state in this way

00:46:05.460 --> 00:46:09.510
such that all of these pasts can
be followed by all these

00:46:09.510 --> 00:46:11.730
futures, and they're
code words?

00:46:11.730 --> 00:46:17.600
In fact, they correspond
to this subset of

00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:20.550
elements of the code.

00:46:20.550 --> 00:46:24.430
We have examples
of it up here.

00:46:24.430 --> 00:46:28.890
For instance, 0, 0, 1, 1.

00:46:28.890 --> 00:46:29.900
Or let's see.

00:46:29.900 --> 00:46:34.590
Let's take a past protection,
1, 1, 0, 0.

00:46:34.590 --> 00:46:36.650
Here's a typical state
sequence, 1, 1,

00:46:36.650 --> 00:46:39.370
0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0.

00:46:39.370 --> 00:46:46.920
And I can add to this anything
in the past, so I get 0, 0, 1,

00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:50.740
1, 1, 1, 0, 0.

00:46:50.740 --> 00:46:54.490
I can add to it any of these
two, anything in the future.

00:46:54.490 --> 00:47:01.570
So I get 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1
and 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1.

00:47:01.570 --> 00:47:05.260
And I claim that all four of
these have the state projected

00:47:05.260 --> 00:47:07.730
on the past equals 1, 1, 0, 0.

00:47:07.730 --> 00:47:13.270
The state projected on the
future is 1, 1, 0, 0.

00:47:13.270 --> 00:47:16.210
And that any of these pasts
can be followed by any of

00:47:16.210 --> 00:47:16.870
these futures.

00:47:16.870 --> 00:47:23.450
So this is C past plus
C future plus 1, 1,

00:47:23.450 --> 00:47:27.080
0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0.

00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:28.330
That is the claim.

00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:41.510
And furthermore, if I go through
this, dot dot dot, I'm

00:47:41.510 --> 00:47:44.540
going to generate everything in
C. So this is the partition

00:47:44.540 --> 00:47:52.970
of C -- into what?

00:47:52.970 --> 00:48:05.520
S cosets of Cp plus Cf,
subcode of C. So

00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:07.280
algebraically, that's
what's going on.

00:48:09.990 --> 00:48:13.340
But having done this partition,
at least with

00:48:13.340 --> 00:48:20.230
respect to this state space, I
can create something which has

00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:24.960
S states the size of
S, which is --

00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:25.690
what is this?

00:48:25.690 --> 00:48:31.830
The dimension of S is the
dimension of C minus the

00:48:31.830 --> 00:48:36.290
dimension of Cp minus
the dimension of Cf.

00:48:41.940 --> 00:48:45.420
So I've argued that
I can get a state

00:48:45.420 --> 00:48:50.120
space with this dimension.

00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:55.590
It's a linear state space, and
it has a certain dimension,

00:48:55.590 --> 00:48:58.046
which is just the dimension of
C minus the dimension of the

00:48:58.046 --> 00:48:59.184
past subcode minus
the dimension

00:48:59.184 --> 00:49:00.450
of the future subcode.

00:49:00.450 --> 00:49:06.180
It's the number of generators
that I need for S. So in the

00:49:06.180 --> 00:49:10.210
example, I need two generators
for S, so I get a state space

00:49:10.210 --> 00:49:12.860
of dimension two,
or size four.

00:49:15.730 --> 00:49:20.015
It's just a vector space
over F2 in this case.

00:49:23.240 --> 00:49:24.400
You all with me?

00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:25.600
I think you are.

00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:28.560
I don't see any great puzzles.

00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:33.380
So I can get at least
these few states.

00:49:33.380 --> 00:49:34.630
Could I get any fewer?

00:49:39.750 --> 00:49:43.800
Can I possibly merge any
two of these states?

00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:50.490
Could I draw a trellis in which,
say, I've mushed the

00:49:50.490 --> 00:49:55.938
zero state together with one
of these nonzero states?

00:49:55.938 --> 00:50:00.610
And the answer to that is
clearly no by the definition

00:50:00.610 --> 00:50:02.490
of the past and the
future subcodes.

00:50:02.490 --> 00:50:08.410
These are all of the future
sequences that can follow the

00:50:08.410 --> 00:50:10.320
all 0 past sequence.

00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:13.010
There can't be any more down
here, so we can't possibly

00:50:13.010 --> 00:50:14.840
mush them together.

00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:21.280
And similarly, just by going
through this, if you can't

00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:26.070
take the past part of one state
and combine it with a

00:50:26.070 --> 00:50:31.170
future part of another state
sequence, because that clearly

00:50:31.170 --> 00:50:33.320
is not in the code.

00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:39.570
And I don't have a slick proof
of that in mind at the moment,

00:50:39.570 --> 00:50:40.900
but there is one in the notes.

00:50:51.770 --> 00:50:55.800
The conclusion from this
is what I call

00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:58.150
the state space theorem.

00:50:58.150 --> 00:51:09.015
Given code C, any partition of
the time axis, the total index

00:51:09.015 --> 00:51:18.060
set, into past and future,
I can do this

00:51:18.060 --> 00:51:19.210
not just at the midpoint.

00:51:19.210 --> 00:51:24.610
I can do this any point along
the code that I want to, any

00:51:24.610 --> 00:51:28.910
partition into past
and future.

00:51:32.470 --> 00:51:33.720
The minimal --

00:51:36.040 --> 00:51:49.170
we get a linear state space, in
other words a vector space,

00:51:49.170 --> 00:51:56.590
S. And the dimension of S is
equal to the dimension of C

00:51:56.590 --> 00:52:02.020
minus the dimension of this
past subcode minus the

00:52:02.020 --> 00:52:03.800
dimension of the
future subcode.

00:52:06.310 --> 00:52:09.590
So we can simply calculate what
the minimal dimension of

00:52:09.590 --> 00:52:11.990
a state space is at any
point along here.

00:52:16.770 --> 00:52:22.110
So for instance, at this point
here, what's the minimal size

00:52:22.110 --> 00:52:24.930
of a state space?

00:52:24.930 --> 00:52:26.620
What's the past subcode here?

00:52:26.620 --> 00:52:31.960
What's the set of all code
sequences that are all 0 in

00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:35.970
the future, as we have
all 0's out here?

00:52:35.970 --> 00:52:41.090
This point, Cp, is just 0, 0.

00:52:41.090 --> 00:52:44.400
It just has dimension 0.

00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:46.040
Yeah, 0

00:52:46.040 --> 00:52:47.810
What's the future subcode?

00:52:47.810 --> 00:52:54.240
This is the subcode which has
support all out here.

00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:58.550
This is anything that
starts with 0, 0.

00:52:58.550 --> 00:53:07.290
This is 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1.

00:53:07.290 --> 00:53:09.700
Let me just write
down generators.

00:53:09.700 --> 00:53:12.500
1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0.

00:53:12.500 --> 00:53:17.590
So there is -- this is dimension
Cp equals 0.

00:53:17.590 --> 00:53:20.920
Dimension Cf equals 2.

00:53:25.290 --> 00:53:35.480
And so the minimum size of the
state space is 4 minus 2.

00:53:35.480 --> 00:53:36.730
That's again 2.

00:53:40.226 --> 00:53:42.975
AUDIENCE: Does this mean
that [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:42.975 --> 00:53:46.610
each state's the number
of states is the same?

00:53:46.610 --> 00:53:48.010
PROFESSOR: Certainly not
true in general.

00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:54.800
Let me ask about time three.

00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:56.050
Can certainly do that.

00:53:59.650 --> 00:54:03.790
Time three, what's
the past subcode?

00:54:03.790 --> 00:54:08.940
This is the code words that
have support on the first

00:54:08.940 --> 00:54:10.490
three symbols.

00:54:10.490 --> 00:54:12.450
Again, that has to have
dimension 0, because the

00:54:12.450 --> 00:54:15.660
minimum weight of
this code is 4.

00:54:15.660 --> 00:54:18.695
So there can't be anything that
just looks like 1,1,1 and

00:54:18.695 --> 00:54:22.390
then five 0's

00:54:22.390 --> 00:54:26.670
What is the future
subcode for that?

00:54:26.670 --> 00:54:29.610
Now the only generator
of the future subcode

00:54:29.610 --> 00:54:32.580
is 0, 1, 1, 1, 1.

00:54:32.580 --> 00:54:35.830
We have to go this far, and then
it's what futures can we

00:54:35.830 --> 00:54:37.350
get from here?

00:54:37.350 --> 00:54:41.720
There are only two words
that are in the future.

00:54:41.720 --> 00:54:45.300
So in that case we have
dimension past is 0.

00:54:45.300 --> 00:54:47.480
Dimension future is 1.

00:54:47.480 --> 00:54:53.720
So if we drew a state space
here, we would have to have

00:54:53.720 --> 00:54:54.970
eight states.

00:54:57.850 --> 00:55:02.230
In fact, I can do that if I just
draw a little state in

00:55:02.230 --> 00:55:06.460
the middle of each
of these lines.

00:55:09.700 --> 00:55:13.050
I get now a trellis picture
which has an explicit state at

00:55:13.050 --> 00:55:18.820
this third time here, but
it has eight states.

00:55:18.820 --> 00:55:21.550
Oo ugly, so I've masked that.

00:55:21.550 --> 00:55:23.205
I've suppressed that
by this nice

00:55:23.205 --> 00:55:24.950
little four-state trellis.

00:55:24.950 --> 00:55:28.720
But yeah, if you insisted on
drawing a state space at time

00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:30.220
three, it would have
eight states in it.

00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:39.900
We'll get back to that when I
get to this turn-the-crank

00:55:39.900 --> 00:55:45.760
procedure, if I do, of getting
to minimal trellises.

00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:46.610
So what have we done?

00:55:46.610 --> 00:55:53.360
We've established that there is
a uniquely defined minimal

00:55:53.360 --> 00:55:56.270
state space size for
any partition

00:55:56.270 --> 00:55:57.590
between past and future.

00:55:57.590 --> 00:55:59.800
In other words, if there's any
time where you want to make a

00:55:59.800 --> 00:56:03.960
cut in the time axis between
past and future, you can

00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:06.800
define what the minimal
state space size is.

00:56:10.320 --> 00:56:19.070
And now you might ask
the question, can we

00:56:19.070 --> 00:56:33.290
simultaneously achieve minimal
state spaces at all times?

00:56:40.200 --> 00:56:46.750
In other words, can we draw a
single trellis which gets the

00:56:46.750 --> 00:56:48.850
minimal state space
at each time?

00:56:54.400 --> 00:56:56.040
We haven't proved
that there is.

00:56:56.040 --> 00:56:59.770
It might be that if you push
in the state space at one

00:56:59.770 --> 00:57:02.470
time, it forces the state
space to balloon out at

00:57:02.470 --> 00:57:05.200
another time.

00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:07.590
And in fact, for nonlinear
codes, that is

00:57:07.590 --> 00:57:08.710
typically what happens.

00:57:08.710 --> 00:57:11.900
But for linear codes, a
minor miracle occurs.

00:57:11.900 --> 00:57:13.760
And the answer is yes.

00:57:17.710 --> 00:57:25.190
So how am I going
to prove that?

00:57:25.190 --> 00:57:30.040
I'm going to prove it via this
very handy tool, which is also

00:57:30.040 --> 00:57:37.230
a construction tool which is
called a trellis-oriented, or

00:57:37.230 --> 00:57:44.085
a little bit more formally, a
minimum span generator matrix.

00:57:56.350 --> 00:58:07.830
The idea here is, given a
generator matrix, reduce to

00:58:07.830 --> 00:58:10.940
trellis-oriented form.

00:58:10.940 --> 00:58:16.600
We're going to prove that this
is unique, or effectively

00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:27.690
unique, and specifies minimal
trellis at all times in a

00:58:27.690 --> 00:58:28.940
certain way.

00:58:36.235 --> 00:58:37.510
Let's start again.

00:58:51.190 --> 00:58:55.320
So loosely, what is a

00:58:55.320 --> 00:58:58.522
trellis-oriented generator matrix?

00:58:58.522 --> 00:59:08.090
Well, if we have a generator,
say 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0,

00:59:08.090 --> 00:59:18.470
its span is this interval from
its starting time to its

00:59:18.470 --> 00:59:19.160
ending time.

00:59:19.160 --> 00:59:21.200
It's this.

00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:27.110
We say it starts at time 3, it
ends at time 6, the span is

00:59:27.110 --> 00:59:30.510
the interval 3 to
6 in this case.

00:59:33.060 --> 00:59:38.190
So we think of this as not being
active before time 3.

00:59:38.190 --> 00:59:42.980
At time 3 we get the first
interesting thing happens.

00:59:42.980 --> 00:59:45.640
A 1 comes up, but then goes
through something.

00:59:45.640 --> 00:59:47.820
These don't have
to all be ones.

00:59:47.820 --> 00:59:49.880
It could be 1, 1, 0, 1.

00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:53.330
Then there's a last 1 at some
point, and then it quiets

00:59:53.330 --> 00:59:55.083
down, and it's dead again.

00:59:55.083 --> 00:59:56.333
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:59:59.250 --> 01:00:01.220
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:00:01.220 --> 01:00:03.310
Except I'm not sure.

01:00:03.310 --> 01:00:06.160
Would you say the support of
this was 3, 4, and 6, or would

01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:10.620
you say it was the interval
from 3 to 6?

01:00:10.620 --> 01:00:11.150
I don't know.

01:00:11.150 --> 01:00:13.490
What's the definition
of support?

01:00:13.490 --> 01:00:15.160
AUDIENCE: I don't know it.

01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:17.200
PROFESSOR: I'm not
sure I know.

01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:20.180
It's probably been defined
both ways in different

01:00:20.180 --> 01:00:21.410
literatures.

01:00:21.410 --> 01:00:26.780
So I'll call it a span, but it's
roughly the support of

01:00:26.780 --> 01:00:28.030
the interesting part.

01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:37.340
So that's the definition
of span.

01:00:37.340 --> 01:00:41.750
And what a trellis-oriented
general matrix is, a

01:00:41.750 --> 01:00:52.400
minimal-span matrix, meaning all
generators have a short a

01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:53.650
span as possible.

01:00:56.980 --> 01:00:58.615
I'll just say, are as
short as possible.

01:01:03.353 --> 01:01:04.690
This is a lecture.

01:01:04.690 --> 01:01:07.690
I can be loose.

01:01:07.690 --> 01:01:10.210
Now it's not even clear that's
well-defined yet.

01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:21.430
But let me again give you an
example, and show you how to

01:01:21.430 --> 01:01:27.480
find a trellis-oriented
generating

01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:29.115
matrix just by example.

01:01:33.670 --> 01:01:40.010
Let me take our example here, 1,
1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0,

01:01:40.010 --> 01:01:46.890
1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1,
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1.

01:01:46.890 --> 01:01:49.690
So there is a generator
matrix that's not in

01:01:49.690 --> 01:01:52.350
trellis-oriented form.

01:01:52.350 --> 01:01:57.190
In particular, I can see that by
adding this to this, I can

01:01:57.190 --> 01:02:00.090
make this generator
have shorter span.

01:02:00.090 --> 01:02:04.450
I can replace it by one, which
is four 0's and then four 1's,

01:02:04.450 --> 01:02:06.090
which we've already
found useful in

01:02:06.090 --> 01:02:09.340
constructing a trellis.

01:02:09.340 --> 01:02:12.920
But let me proceed through
it more systematically.

01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:16.050
How can I make --

01:02:16.050 --> 01:02:19.380
this generator generates
all words in the code.

01:02:19.380 --> 01:02:22.200
So how can I find a set of
linearly independent

01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:25.670
generators that has
shorter span?

01:02:25.670 --> 01:02:28.770
There's the sort of greedy
way of proceeding.

01:02:28.770 --> 01:02:31.380
Let's take the first
two generators.

01:02:31.380 --> 01:02:34.390
Can I combine these to find
anything that has a shorter

01:02:34.390 --> 01:02:39.560
span, that I can replace one
of the generators with?

01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:40.546
Anybody?

01:02:40.546 --> 01:02:42.120
AUDIENCE: No.

01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:43.515
PROFESSOR: No, I can't.

01:02:43.515 --> 01:02:45.190
That's not the answer
I expected to hear.

01:02:48.142 --> 01:02:49.392
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:02:52.570 --> 01:02:55.220
PROFESSOR: Let's identify what
the spans of these are.

01:02:55.220 --> 01:02:56.500
That has a span of four.

01:02:56.500 --> 01:02:57.990
That has a span of six.

01:02:57.990 --> 01:02:59.840
That has a span of seven.

01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:01.470
This has a span of eight.

01:03:01.470 --> 01:03:04.388
What I'm trying to do
is to reduce that.

01:03:04.388 --> 01:03:07.150
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:03:07.150 --> 01:03:09.470
PROFESSOR: So if I add the first
two, that seems like a

01:03:09.470 --> 01:03:16.920
good thing to do, because then
I get 0, 0, 1, 1, and I've

01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:19.050
reduced the span of
that generator.

01:03:25.830 --> 01:03:30.075
Any way I can combine these
two to reduce the span?

01:03:34.830 --> 01:03:38.060
Obviously not, because the span
of this is completely

01:03:38.060 --> 01:03:40.270
included in the span of this.

01:03:40.270 --> 01:03:43.760
If I add these two together,
then I'll get something which

01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:47.280
still starts here
and ends here.

01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:50.860
Why was I able to reduce
the span here?

01:03:50.860 --> 01:03:54.970
Because the spans had the same
starting time, so I got a

01:03:54.970 --> 01:03:59.075
cancellation of the first bit.

01:03:59.075 --> 01:04:00.470
I got a 0 up here.

01:04:00.470 --> 01:04:03.540
That's what I wanted.

01:04:03.540 --> 01:04:05.860
So that's the key
to proceeding.

01:04:05.860 --> 01:04:09.280
If I see any place, any two that
have the same starting

01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:15.750
time, then I can add them
together, and the result will

01:04:15.750 --> 01:04:17.610
be something that has a
shorter span than at

01:04:17.610 --> 01:04:18.860
least one of them.

01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:23.840
So let me do that.

01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:27.730
I see two here that have the
same starting time, and so I

01:04:27.730 --> 01:04:31.820
add that to that, and
I get 0 1 0 1.

01:04:31.820 --> 01:04:35.520
So I've got the span
down to here.

01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:37.020
I can do that down here.

01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:46.140
And I get this, which is a very
nice reduction in span.

01:04:46.140 --> 01:04:49.880
Can I go any further?

01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:52.890
I can clearly look for the same
thing in ending times, if

01:04:52.890 --> 01:04:56.960
I could find two ending times
that were the same.

01:04:56.960 --> 01:05:00.640
I could do the same trick, add
those two generators together,

01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:03.960
and the result would be
something that was shorter

01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:07.680
than at least one of the
component generators.

01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:10.330
But here are my starting
times, here,

01:05:10.330 --> 01:05:12.680
here, here, and here.

01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:13.780
They're all different.

01:05:13.780 --> 01:05:19.640
So I have no possibility for
combining two and getting a

01:05:19.640 --> 01:05:21.240
better starting time.

01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:24.550
Similarly, the ending times
are here, here, and here.

01:05:24.550 --> 01:05:26.590
They're all different.

01:05:26.590 --> 01:05:27.840
So I'm done.

01:05:33.910 --> 01:05:35.190
So, that's how you find a

01:05:35.190 --> 01:05:39.340
trellis-oriented generator matrix.

01:05:39.340 --> 01:05:46.450
And there's a closely associated
theorem, which is

01:05:46.450 --> 01:05:57.040
that a generator matrix g is
trellis-oriented if, and only

01:05:57.040 --> 01:06:11.522
if, all starting times differ,
all ending terms differ.

01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:24.800
Yeah?

01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:27.596
AUDIENCE: What's the definition
of all generators

01:06:27.596 --> 01:06:31.410
as short as possible?

01:06:31.410 --> 01:06:34.150
PROFESSOR: I'm now making it.

01:06:34.150 --> 01:06:35.400
This is really just
motivation.

01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:43.130
So this can be my actual
definition of a

01:06:43.130 --> 01:06:45.030
trellis-oriented generator
matrix, which

01:06:45.030 --> 01:06:46.910
I've proved this theorem.

01:06:46.910 --> 01:06:49.550
It's a matrix in which all the
starting times are different,

01:06:49.550 --> 01:06:51.310
and all the ending times
are different.

01:06:51.310 --> 01:06:54.240
And what I've achieved is
that all generators

01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:55.827
are as short as possible.

01:07:01.940 --> 01:07:05.285
How would I go about proving
the theorem?

01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:15.170
Suppose I have a matrix that's
not in this form.

01:07:15.170 --> 01:07:17.405
And I've already proved that I
can shorten the generators.

01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:23.140
So if it's not in this form,
it's not trellis-oriented.

01:07:23.140 --> 01:07:26.840
The generators are not
as short as possible.

01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:28.810
So all I need to do is
prove the other side.

01:07:28.810 --> 01:07:30.510
Suppose it is in this form.

01:07:33.170 --> 01:07:38.510
Then could I possibly find
shorter generators?

01:07:41.850 --> 01:07:48.810
And the proof of that is
basically the following lemma,

01:07:48.810 --> 01:08:02.863
that the subcode C, take
any interval kk prime.

01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:19.355
So given a trellis-oriented
generating matrix, namely one

01:08:19.355 --> 01:08:23.100
that satisfies these conditions,
then the subcode

01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:26.640
consisting of all the code words
who have support on this

01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:37.910
interval is generated by
the gj in G that have

01:08:37.910 --> 01:08:44.700
support in kk prime.

01:08:49.410 --> 01:08:53.090
And that's kind of intuitive
and obvious.

01:08:53.090 --> 01:08:56.479
On the one hand, it's clear that
any linear combination of

01:08:56.479 --> 01:09:01.979
these generators is a code
word in the subcode.

01:09:01.979 --> 01:09:04.689
Obviously they all have support
in this interval.

01:09:04.689 --> 01:09:06.899
I can't generate anything that
has support outside that

01:09:06.899 --> 01:09:10.244
interval by linear
combinations.

01:09:14.319 --> 01:09:21.590
So the only question is, can I
possibly get anything that's

01:09:21.590 --> 01:09:28.210
in the subcode by combining
with a generator that is

01:09:28.210 --> 01:09:30.300
outside this interval?

01:09:30.300 --> 01:09:39.510
And again, it's clear that say I
take kk prime to be here, if

01:09:39.510 --> 01:09:43.569
all the starting times are
different, and all the ending

01:09:43.569 --> 01:09:47.200
times are different, and I start
to add generators that

01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:50.850
are outside here, I can't
possibly get cancellation of

01:09:50.850 --> 01:09:54.420
the starting time, or I can't
possibly get cancellation of

01:09:54.420 --> 01:09:55.690
the ending time.

01:09:55.690 --> 01:09:59.470
So I'm going to wind up with a
code word which has support

01:09:59.470 --> 01:10:00.720
outside the interval.

01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:06.812
So, it really is
a simple lemma.

01:10:06.812 --> 01:10:07.804
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:10:07.804 --> 01:10:10.794
have the all 0 code word?

01:10:10.794 --> 01:10:11.690
PROFESSOR: Excuse me?

01:10:11.690 --> 01:10:14.430
AUDIENCE: The all 0 word will
be part of the subcode.

01:10:14.430 --> 01:10:16.683
PROFESSOR: The all 0 word is
always part of the subcode.

01:10:16.683 --> 01:10:18.036
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:10:18.036 --> 01:10:20.300
who has something outside
this interval.

01:10:20.300 --> 01:10:23.585
Then when you add that with the
all 0 one, you would get

01:10:23.585 --> 01:10:26.258
something that does not belong
to the subcode, [INAUDIBLE]

01:10:29.180 --> 01:10:32.350
PROFESSOR: Right, but
I have to ask if

01:10:32.350 --> 01:10:35.880
there's any code word.

01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:38.480
So I have to consider all
the code words, really.

01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:44.120
But I'm saying if I have a code
word C that is sum of the

01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:48.010
generators, and I have a nonzero
coefficient here on

01:10:48.010 --> 01:10:53.390
any generator that has starting
time outside this

01:10:53.390 --> 01:10:56.920
interval or ending time outside
this interval, then I

01:10:56.920 --> 01:10:59.320
can't possibly get
cancellation of

01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:00.460
that nonzero thing.

01:11:00.460 --> 01:11:06.090
And so if it really requires
this to be nonzero, and then

01:11:06.090 --> 01:11:07.570
I'm going to say that
I get a code word

01:11:07.570 --> 01:11:08.820
that's not in this subcode.

01:11:11.340 --> 01:11:13.690
So that's very quick, intuitive

01:11:13.690 --> 01:11:15.380
sketch of that proof.

01:11:15.380 --> 01:11:24.750
Again, for writing it
out, see the notes.

01:11:24.750 --> 01:11:34.510
But this lemma then proves this
theorem, because it now

01:11:34.510 --> 01:11:35.760
says I can't --

01:11:40.260 --> 01:11:43.000
if all the starting times are
different, and all the ending

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:47.210
times are different, then I
can't possibly get shorter

01:11:47.210 --> 01:11:49.043
support for any of
the generators.

01:11:52.700 --> 01:11:55.510
And I don't think so in a
totally convincing way, but

01:11:55.510 --> 01:11:59.650
that basically is
the point here.

01:11:59.650 --> 01:12:00.902
Yeah?

01:12:00.902 --> 01:12:02.152
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:12:06.030 --> 01:12:07.750
PROFESSOR: Well, now
I'm defining this.

01:12:07.750 --> 01:12:11.610
So, meaning that all the
starting times are different,

01:12:11.610 --> 01:12:12.540
and all the ending times
are different.

01:12:12.540 --> 01:12:15.130
From now on that's going to
be my definition of a

01:12:15.130 --> 01:12:17.350
trellis-oriented generator
matrix.

01:12:17.350 --> 01:12:20.647
So, saying that this property
implies this property.

01:12:25.790 --> 01:12:30.350
But now this lemma has an
interesting consequence.

01:12:30.350 --> 01:12:54.190
This implies for any past and
future, Cp is generated by the

01:12:54.190 --> 01:13:02.820
generators in a trellis-oriented
generating

01:13:02.820 --> 01:13:09.090
matrix with support in p.

01:13:09.090 --> 01:13:16.880
And similarly, Cf is generated
by the generators

01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:20.690
with support in f.

01:13:20.690 --> 01:13:34.510
So for any p and f, I get a
picture that looks like this.

01:13:34.510 --> 01:13:37.350
I can draw now this boundary
anywhere I want, and if the

01:13:37.350 --> 01:13:40.700
matrix was trellis-oriented,
then I'm going to get a

01:13:40.700 --> 01:13:43.830
certain subset of generators
that live in the past, and

01:13:43.830 --> 01:13:45.880
they'll be the generators
in fact of Cp.

01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:52.190
The dimension of them will
simply be the number of

01:13:52.190 --> 01:13:53.980
generators that live in
the past for that

01:13:53.980 --> 01:13:55.750
definition of the past.

01:13:55.750 --> 01:13:56.980
There will be some other
set that live

01:13:56.980 --> 01:13:58.240
entirely in the future.

01:13:58.240 --> 01:14:00.930
Those will be the ones that
generate the future.

01:14:00.930 --> 01:14:03.110
And the ones that are neither
wholly in the past or in the

01:14:03.110 --> 01:14:07.140
future will generate
the state code.

01:14:07.140 --> 01:14:14.750
So that says I can read off the
dimensions of the state

01:14:14.750 --> 01:14:18.010
spaces just by looking at this
single trellis-oriented

01:14:18.010 --> 01:14:20.910
generator matrix.

01:14:20.910 --> 01:14:23.940
So now let me very quickly go
through the calculation that I

01:14:23.940 --> 01:14:27.880
went through a little bit
laboriously over here.

01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:31.970
Suppose I make the whole
thing the future.

01:14:31.970 --> 01:14:35.960
In other words, I draw
a cut before time 0.

01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:42.340
Then the state space
has dimension 0.

01:14:42.340 --> 01:14:44.290
All four generators live
on the future.

01:14:44.290 --> 01:14:50.440
If I make the cut here, the
state space has dimension 1,

01:14:50.440 --> 01:14:53.530
because three of the generators
live on the future.

01:14:53.530 --> 01:14:56.630
One is active at time 1.

01:14:56.630 --> 01:15:02.050
So that means I'm going to get a
two-state trellis at time 1.

01:15:02.050 --> 01:15:06.250
If I make the cut here between
past and future, I see two

01:15:06.250 --> 01:15:10.670
generators live on the future
and are inactive, haven't

01:15:10.670 --> 01:15:12.210
started yet.

01:15:12.210 --> 01:15:15.870
But two of the generators
have already started.

01:15:15.870 --> 01:15:19.380
At this time we have three
active generators.

01:15:19.380 --> 01:15:22.210
Only one is still completely
on the future.

01:15:22.210 --> 01:15:28.170
At this time in the middle I
have two generators which --

01:15:28.170 --> 01:15:32.660
past subcode, future subcode,
and two that aren't.

01:15:32.660 --> 01:15:35.470
So I get this form that we
looked at over there.

01:15:35.470 --> 01:15:38.610
And I get a state space here
generated by these two

01:15:38.610 --> 01:15:41.600
generators of size two.

01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:47.950
So just by looking at this I go
right through the picture,

01:15:47.950 --> 01:15:51.740
and I find the size of the
state space at each time.

01:15:55.990 --> 01:16:00.310
So this is an algebraic way of
finding the minimal state.

01:16:00.310 --> 01:16:07.860
So now I can draw from this a
trellis just by writing down

01:16:07.860 --> 01:16:09.110
these state spaces.

01:16:13.796 --> 01:16:17.040
Let me leave these
trellises here.

01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:19.720
Let me draw now a full
trellis, or an

01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:21.000
eight-section trellis.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:25.840
I'm only going to put one
bit on each trellis.

01:16:25.840 --> 01:16:29.300
Here is the starting
state, dimension 0.

01:16:29.300 --> 01:16:30.190
One state.

01:16:30.190 --> 01:16:34.806
From that I can go
out to 0 or 1.

01:16:34.806 --> 01:16:38.750
I won't label the
state spaces.

01:16:38.750 --> 01:16:40.956
Next time, I'm still
just branching.

01:16:47.400 --> 01:16:49.750
Actually, to make it look like
that, I'm going to want to

01:16:49.750 --> 01:16:56.990
come down here, 0,
1, 1, 1, 1, 0.

01:17:02.610 --> 01:17:06.040
I basically just have four
states at time two

01:17:06.040 --> 01:17:08.880
corresponding to whatever
the first two bits are.

01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:11.570
They all go to different states,
because all these have

01:17:11.570 --> 01:17:14.500
possible future continuations.

01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:16.680
Then I have eight
states at this

01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:19.215
time, still just branching.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:40.966
Sorry, this is going to take
some time to do correctly.

01:17:48.250 --> 01:17:53.075
Add this time, then
I come in here.

01:17:53.075 --> 01:17:54.325
0, 1.

01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:23.620
Anyway, and it's symmetrical
on the other side.

01:18:23.620 --> 01:18:27.580
So that's what a full trellis
will look like.

01:18:27.580 --> 01:18:30.620
And how did I do this trellis
in principle?

01:18:30.620 --> 01:18:35.130
I wrote down all
16 code words.

01:18:35.130 --> 01:18:37.810
I wrote down what linear
combinations they were up

01:18:37.810 --> 01:18:41.970
here, and I therefore found what
states they went through

01:18:41.970 --> 01:18:43.350
at each time.

01:18:43.350 --> 01:18:48.020
And then I just drew the graph
that goes through that

01:18:48.020 --> 01:18:50.340
describes those trajectories.

01:18:50.340 --> 01:18:52.550
So I wrote down all
the code words.

01:18:52.550 --> 01:18:56.060
I wrote down all these state
codes at all these times.

01:18:56.060 --> 01:18:57.530
I could have written them
down in any order.

01:18:57.530 --> 01:19:01.640
And then I just connected
the dots according

01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:03.620
to which state --

01:19:03.620 --> 01:19:07.850
I make this calculation as to
which state they go through.

01:19:15.590 --> 01:19:17.530
That's a good place to stop.

01:19:17.530 --> 01:19:18.780
Let me summarize.

01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:28.590
We now have a method, given a
generator matrix for a binary

01:19:28.590 --> 01:19:32.740
linear block code, of reducing
that generator matrix to

01:19:32.740 --> 01:19:36.160
trellis-oriented form.

01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:39.840
Just by inspection of the
trellis-oriented generator

01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:43.740
matrix, we can determine what
the state space dimensions are

01:19:43.740 --> 01:19:48.580
at each instant of time, at
each possible state cut.

01:19:51.660 --> 01:19:58.110
And we can then draw a trellis
which achieves that minimal

01:19:58.110 --> 01:20:02.910
state space dimension, or
minimal state space size, for

01:20:02.910 --> 01:20:04.400
every moment of time
simultaneously.

01:20:07.290 --> 01:20:13.580
And I assert that this trellis
is the minimal trellis in

01:20:13.580 --> 01:20:16.360
every respect, whether you're
trying to minimize state

01:20:16.360 --> 01:20:21.350
complexity, or if you're using
the Viterbi algorithm.

01:20:21.350 --> 01:20:23.960
Really what you want to minimize
is the number of

01:20:23.960 --> 01:20:27.370
branches, but there's a
calculation about branch

01:20:27.370 --> 01:20:31.650
spaces in the notes that shows
that this also achieves the

01:20:31.650 --> 01:20:35.190
minimal branch space size at
every time, regardless of how

01:20:35.190 --> 01:20:38.260
you draw the trellis.

01:20:38.260 --> 01:20:42.960
More elaborate calculations with
a more refined notion of

01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:45.260
Viterbi algorithm complexities
still come up

01:20:45.260 --> 01:20:47.160
with the same result.

01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:51.730
The result is there is
essentially a unique minimal

01:20:51.730 --> 01:20:54.450
trellis, where it's minimal
in every way.

01:20:57.775 --> 01:21:05.950
And this comes from the linear,
or more broadly, the

01:21:05.950 --> 01:21:09.510
group property of the code.

01:21:09.510 --> 01:21:14.600
So for any linear group code,
there's a well-defined,

01:21:14.600 --> 01:21:21.670
essentially unique up to
re-labeling, minimal trellis

01:21:21.670 --> 01:21:26.430
that achieves the minimum of
whatever complexity quantity

01:21:26.430 --> 01:21:27.340
you want to define.

01:21:27.340 --> 01:21:35.170
So in this sense, the trellis
complexity of a group or

01:21:35.170 --> 01:21:38.090
linear code is very
well-defined.

01:21:38.090 --> 01:21:43.150
It's defined by this minimal
trellis, or by its parameters,

01:21:43.150 --> 01:21:46.170
and we can use that as a measure
of the complexity of

01:21:46.170 --> 01:21:49.540
the corresponding group code.

01:21:49.540 --> 01:21:52.790
And from an engineering point
of view, once we've got this

01:21:52.790 --> 01:21:55.620
minimal trellis, we can use the
Viterbi algorithm to do

01:21:55.620 --> 01:21:58.540
maximum likelihood decoding.

01:21:58.540 --> 01:22:01.650
Just in the same way we did for
convolutional codes, sweep

01:22:01.650 --> 01:22:04.242
from the starting node
to the ending node.

01:22:06.830 --> 01:22:10.510
Digest that, and we'll come back
and talk about it again.

01:22:10.510 --> 01:22:12.470
Do a few more details
on Monday, but

01:22:12.470 --> 01:22:13.720
that's the basic idea.
