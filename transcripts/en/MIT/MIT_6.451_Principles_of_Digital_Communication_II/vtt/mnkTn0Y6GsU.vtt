00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.060
PROFESSOR: So OK, what
did we do last time?

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:05.334
Thanks for coming
back by the way.

00:00:05.334 --> 00:00:08.870
So last time, we
did MDS codes.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.600
MDS codes, and we
looked at this.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.425
And we derived some generic
properties of these things if

00:00:21.425 --> 00:00:22.380
they existed.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.025
And then eventually, we moved
to Reed-Solomon codes.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.759
And so indeed, they exist.

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.170
We talked a little bit about
existence altogether, the main

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.425
conjection, MDS codes,
I just wrote it down.

00:00:39.425 --> 00:00:41.120
And like I said, you
want to be rich and

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.890
famous, solve this.

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:50.050
There's people doing geometry
in math that would be

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.460
deliriously happy if
you solved it.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.780
So if for nothing else.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.240
So the last thing I wrote down
last time was something about

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.800
a matrix which somebody
recognized as some Fourier

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.890
transform matrix.

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.530
And that's where I want to pick
up here, at least quickly

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.460
make that connection.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.500
So let me rewrite the definition
of Reed-Solomon

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.330
codes again.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.870
And so a Reed-Solomon code,
the way we defined it last

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.475
time was all field elements,
we would evaluate the

00:01:22.475 --> 00:01:24.880
polynomial in all
field elements.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.130
Now we do it slightly
different.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:34.590
Let me make it Solomon-Stein
in order to denote that

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:35.320
difference.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:46.150
And let's say this is
beta 0, beta n.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.730
So that's the old definition.

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:11.530
Only the, let's say, the beta 0,
beta 1, up to beta n, they

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.730
are the non-zero elements now.

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.390
And just for the heck of it, so
we talked about punctured

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.360
Reed-Solomon codes last
time that it would

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.600
still be MDS codes.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.185
So nothing has changed there.

00:02:22.185 --> 00:02:25.510
In particular, all the arguments
would be the same.

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:32.170
In particular, just to humor me,
let's say beta i is omega

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:42.920
to the i, where omega
is primitive in Fq.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.790
So what that means, you remember
that primitive means

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.460
that the powers of omega
cycle through all

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.040
the non-zero elements.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.760
Remember the non-zero elements
are a multiplicative group.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:55.830
And it's a cyclic group.

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.080
And it's the generator
of the group.

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.220
Good.

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:19.180
So once we write it like this,
we can actually write down the

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.680
whole Reed-Solomon code in some
sort of transfer domain

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.855
description in the Fourier
transform.

00:03:25.855 --> 00:03:28.710
And the way this goes
is the following.

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:36.000
So from now on, I will make
implicit identification

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.950
without making them.

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.680
So this is an identification
which I

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.360
just jump around between.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.790
A vector --

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:49.280
so this one would be a Fqn.

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:57.604
And Fx would be maybe
0 to MDS 1.

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:11.310
Let's leave it at that.

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:12.080
So I make this --

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.820
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:18.430
PROFESSOR: Yeah, let's make
this identification free.

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.570
It's just a vector of length n
and a polynomial of length n.

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.240
And so whenever I want this
to have a low degree, the

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.010
polynomial, then I just
write that expression.

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.490
So this identification
we make freely now.

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.620
And then how can we write F?

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:48.820
Let F now be code word in
the Reed-Solomon code.

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.000
And then I say Fi.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.620
What is Fi?

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.390
The i is element.

00:04:54.390 --> 00:05:03.400
Well, we know that this is
F of omega to the i.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.200
So this is, at the moment,
counted from 0.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.100
So this is --

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.730
you write it out --

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:32.340
Fj omega to the i to the
j, which is omega i j.

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:33.530
And now, at this point in time,

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:34.780
everybody recognizes this.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.670
This would be the discrete
Fourier transform of a vector.

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:45.940
This is an element of order n.

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:47.840
Usually, there's e to
the j and then an

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:48.970
element of order n.

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:50.240
Now it's in the finite field.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.100
But what's the difference?

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.180
This would be the Fourier
transform.

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.450
So a code word would be the
Fourier transform of a vector

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:03.350
F. Let's just make sure it also
goes the other direction.

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:12.410
So I claim that Fl would be --
so what would be the Fourier

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:16.630
transform if it, indeed, is
the Fourier transform?

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:25.680
It is a minus, and then
it goes n minus 1

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:31.450
Fj omega minus jl.

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:34.560
So the question is
is that true?

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.400
Because that would
be the inverse.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:38.978
Is that true?

00:06:38.978 --> 00:06:43.750
Well, let's do what we do with
proofs of this type.

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:47.860
I need that space here.

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:48.286
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:48.286 --> 00:06:48.712
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

00:06:48.712 --> 00:06:49.990
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:50.420
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:52.540
So let's do what we do with
proofs of this type.

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:56.970
That means we write it out.

00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:59.170
That's another beautiful thing
about finite fields.

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:02.790
You never have to worry
about convergence.

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:07.310
So for the F, we just
plug that in here.

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:10.310
Sum, this would be --

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:11.590
what do we call it --

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:33.920
Fi omega to the ij.

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:38.860
So this would be Fj.

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:42.600
And then I want omega
minus jl.

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:43.535
So is that true?

00:07:43.535 --> 00:07:45.930
Is the identity now true?

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:47.420
Well, we see two sums.

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:50.200
What do we do with two sums?

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:52.000
If we're compelled to exchange
the order, that's

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.570
always what we do.

00:07:55.570 --> 00:08:02.150
So Fi goes out.

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:09.900
And then you get
omega to the --

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:12.160
what do we do --

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:15.290
i minus l times j.

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:25.970
We have this.

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:27.450
And so what is this?

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:33.270
How can we work this out?

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:35.280
Well, you know how to
express the sum.

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:42.280
So this part of the sum is
really just omega i minus l to

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:49.472
the n minus 1 minus 1.

00:08:49.472 --> 00:08:51.690
Well, that's a standard
formula for summing

00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:52.840
these things up.

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:57.280
But omega is an element
of order n.

00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:58.900
Omega was an element
of order n.

00:08:58.900 --> 00:08:59.870
That's how we chose it.

00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:00.750
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:01.595
PROFESSOR: It's what?

00:09:01.595 --> 00:09:04.040
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:06.680
PROFESSOR: You multiplied
omega --

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:09.630
it's primitive in the
field, so omega --

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:17.430
we have omega da-da-da-da-da i
unequal to 1 for all i less

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:22.300
than n and omega n
is equal to 1.

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:23.550
So OK.

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:28.570
That's fine.

00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:29.910
So it's an element of order n.

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:31.360
That means the n-th power.

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:32.610
We can interchange this.

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:39.070
So this is 1 to the some
power remains 1.

00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:40.790
So 1 minus 1 is 0.

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:41.620
The denominator --

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:44.140
well, actually, we get
two results here.

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:51.555
If i is unequal to l,
then this is 0.

00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:02.590
If i is equal to l, then this
was just the sum of n once.

00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:05.240
So we get n here.

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:05.970
i equal to 0.

00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:13.790
But n was q minus 1, the number
of non-zero field

00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:17.050
elements because it was
primitive in the field.

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:23.990
And this one is just minus
1 in the field.

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:30.190
Because q, we compute q is the
power of the prime of p.

00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:31.220
So that would be 0.

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:33.220
If we just come out
as minus 1, that

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:34.650
explains this minus here.

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:37.000
And we can get rid of
the question mark.

00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:42.180
Look correct?

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:42.550
All right.

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:43.985
According to popular
vote, it is.

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:48.740
So what do we really
have here?

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:51.340
We have everything we want
from a Fourier transform.

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:53.740
We have a Fourier
transform pair.

00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:04.780
We have a vector f, which we can
think of as being in the

00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:06.030
frequency domain.

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:15.700
Then we have a vector F,
which is a Fourier

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:17.920
transform of that.

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:31.390
This one would be in the code
if the degree of this

00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:32.880
polynomial here would
be less than k.

00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:39.260
So now how can we understand
Reed-Solomon codes now from an

00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.010
engineering point of view?

00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:43.150
Classical --

00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:45.110
what about band-limited
functions?

00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:47.936
What do we know about
band-limited functions?

00:11:47.936 --> 00:11:54.442
Because in a sense, the degree
less than k, this means that

00:11:54.442 --> 00:11:58.810
Fi is 0 for all i
greater than k.

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:02.820
That's what it means.

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:06.070
So in a sense, it's nothing but
a band-limited function if

00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:09.060
this is a frequency domain,
if you consider this as a

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:10.320
frequency domain.

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:14.600
So what do we know about the
band-limited function?

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:18.590
Well, if a function
is band limited,

00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:20.780
it cannot be impulsive.

00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:22.000
We know that.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.940
It's a part of the frequency,
and the frequency domain is

00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:30.520
inversely relational to the
support of the function.

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:32.660
So the whole idea of
Reed-Solomon codes, in a

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:35.540
sense, can actually be
understood, at least

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:37.960
intuitively, from Fourier
transform and the duality

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:40.162
between time and frequency.

00:12:40.162 --> 00:12:41.094
Yeah.

00:12:41.094 --> 00:12:43.430
AUDIENCE: Was q a
prime number?

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:47.722
PROFESSOR: q is not prime.
q is a power of a prime.

00:12:47.722 --> 00:12:49.000
q to the n.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.250
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:54.840
PROFESSOR: There always is.

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:55.400
Oh, sorry.

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:56.350
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:59.820
or because for any q, there
would be always a primitive?

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:02.740
PROFESSOR: Why there's always
a primitive element

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:03.990
in the field --

00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:07.360
yeah, sorry.

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:08.820
I thought you had gone
through that.

00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:15.370
It's because the non-zero
elements in a field always

00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:18.110
make up a multiplicative
group.

00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:21.640
And it's always a cyclic
multiplicative group.

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:25.690
So it's a cyclic multiplicative
group.

00:13:25.690 --> 00:13:28.932
And it's just the generator
of that group.

00:13:28.932 --> 00:13:30.700
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
it was a --

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:32.800
PROFESSOR: It's the same
statement as saying, a cyclic

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:34.050
group has a generator.

00:13:38.394 --> 00:13:43.024
AUDIENCE: If Fq, for example,
was a z, zq,

00:13:43.024 --> 00:13:46.680
then q has to be prime.

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:47.290
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:49.480
Yeah, in order for it to be a
field, q has to be prime.

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:49.905
Right.

00:13:49.905 --> 00:13:51.180
That's true.

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:52.030
That's true.

00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:55.490
But we are not worried
about --

00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:58.150
There's also a beautiful theory
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

00:13:58.150 --> 00:14:01.950
rings if this would not be a
prime, very nice theory,

00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:03.775
becomes a little bit
more technical.

00:14:03.775 --> 00:14:05.855
You see, more technical,
then more difficult.

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:13.210
I just wanted to give you this
correspondence on the Fourier

00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:16.170
transform because it's, from an
engineering point of view,

00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:19.200
a very nice insight.

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:21.510
One of the reasons one can
understand that Reed-Solomon

00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:24.220
codes have a good minimum
distance is because it has a

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:25.790
transform of a band-limited
function.

00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:31.170
So that's what I wanted
to say about the

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:33.240
Fourier transforms here.

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:34.820
I do not want to spend
too much time.

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:36.145
I have to get through
decoding here.

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:42.820
Since we have now this Fourier
transform correspondence, we

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:43.740
can do another thing.

00:14:43.740 --> 00:15:00.720
We can, namely, say, well, F is
in the code if and only if

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:02.420
the Fourier transform --

00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:05.740
so that was the back
transform here.

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:11.480
Also now, the code word, we can
interpret the code word as

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:12.180
a polynomial.

00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:15.460
And the inverse transform
is just evaluating

00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:19.980
it at an omega again.

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:26.010
F is in the code if and only the
transform of a code word

00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:34.385
is 0 for all i greater than
k up to n minus 1.

00:15:34.385 --> 00:15:34.850
Yeah.

00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:36.100
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:41.375
PROFESSOR: So it basically
just means the support.

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:49.650
If this one is band limited,
then this one cannot have

00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:51.610
arbitrarily small support.

00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:55.110
That's what it means.

00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:56.460
That's really all
I wanted to say.

00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:09.620
i greater than k and
less than n.

00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:15.470
So we have that F is in the
code if and only the

00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:20.700
polynomial evaluates to 0
at a bunch of points.

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:23.060
Now that leads to something
interesting.

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:28.700
Because now we can say, well,
so what if we've just

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:34.860
construct our set of vectors F
so that they evaluate to 0

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:37.190
somewhere where we want
them to zero.

00:16:37.190 --> 00:16:40.630
We construct them somewhat
differently than here.

00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:48.250
And in particular, let's define
g as a product of i

00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:58.560
equal k up to n minus 1 of
x minus omega minus i.

00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:00.950
So it's a polynomial.

00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:07.369
This is a polynomial which
satisfies this.

00:17:07.369 --> 00:17:16.210
So in particular, we have g of
omega minus i is equal to 0

00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:20.481
for all i less than
n less than --

00:17:20.481 --> 00:17:21.864
I'm sorry --

00:17:21.864 --> 00:17:23.250
and greater than k.

00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:30.700
So this is a code word, right?

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:33.116
We are agreed this
is a code word?

00:17:33.116 --> 00:17:33.940
Good.

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:36.330
So we found a code word without
going through this

00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:40.020
here, without going through
the evaluation map.

00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:42.000
We found it straight away.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.210
But not only did we find this.

00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:48.470
This has degree n minus k.

00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:51.190
This has degree n minus k.

00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:53.990
So maybe there's another
interpretation.

00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:59.000
Now we can give a whole new
definition of the Reed-Solomon

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:08.110
code, namely, as a set of
polynomials, which are sort of

00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:17.490
implicitly identified with a set
of vectors such that times

00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:30.830
this g of x and h of x
is less then k again.

00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:35.330
So what we have here, it's
again, you take a vector space

00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:38.050
of functions the h.

00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:40.800
It's a k dimensional
vector space.

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:43.426
And we multiplied with this g.

00:18:43.426 --> 00:18:46.280
It's again a linear map, this
multiplication with a fixed

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:47.530
polynomial.

00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:52.340
A linear map of this vector
space gives us, again, a

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:54.810
vector space of dimension k.

00:18:54.810 --> 00:19:01.260
And all elements in this vector
space evaluate to 0 for

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:04.270
all omega to the minus i.

00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:06.140
That's just the same
again, just the

00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:07.570
Reed-Solomon code again.

00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:12.140
So it's a very nice
complementary description to

00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:17.210
the same Reed-Solomon code we
could define up here, we have

00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:18.665
found again down here.

00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:24.550
What is so nice about this?

00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:33.830
Yeah, what do you think
is so nice about this?

00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:35.080
About this description?

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:42.344
So now you have to think
as engineers.

00:19:42.344 --> 00:19:43.710
AUDIENCE: You can still
evaluate it.

00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:47.930
There, we have to evaluate it
at end points of function.

00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:48.930
PROFESSOR: Yeah, exactly.

00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:51.710
This is so easy to implement.

00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:55.730
So now we think a little
bit about encoder.

00:19:55.730 --> 00:20:04.320
An encoder for a Reed-Solomon
code.

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:05.570
How would we do that?

00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:08.760
You look at this here.

00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:09.950
Hey, let's do this.

00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:11.550
Let's exactly do this.

00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:18.810
Meaning in VLSI, we do
something like --

00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:38.450
and here, you would write
-- and this is

00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:41.700
just a delay element.

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:48.290
This one would be g n minus k.

00:20:48.290 --> 00:20:49.540
This one --

00:20:54.150 --> 00:20:56.120
so these would be the
coefficients.

00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:58.990
This polynomial, we can evaluate
once and for all.

00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:01.790
We do that once before we
start our communication.

00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:04.040
We evaluate that polynomial
once and for all.

00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:06.050
We know these coefficients.

00:21:06.050 --> 00:21:10.770
So these are multipliers which
multiply with those

00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:12.060
corresponding coefficients.

00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:19.450
And we feed into here the
coefficients of this

00:21:19.450 --> 00:21:20.160
polynomial.

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:22.430
This is our information symbols,
which we simply feed

00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:25.930
into this circuitry.

00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:30.410
And into this circuit, out
comes F, out comes the

00:21:30.410 --> 00:21:32.290
coefficient.

00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:34.300
Polynomial multiplication.

00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:37.200
If you show that to a
VLSI designer, they

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:39.330
are deliriously happy.

00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:40.470
They say, you know what?

00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:41.690
I implement you this thing.

00:21:41.690 --> 00:21:45.940
I implement you in 5,000 gates,
which is close to

00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:47.190
nothing nowadays.

00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:50.240
Maybe not.

00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:53.690
Maybe 10,000.

00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:56.500
And there you get to the
second reason that

00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:58.680
Reed-Solomon codes
are so extremely

00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:00.540
important in practice.

00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:04.660
On the one hand, they are MDS
codes, meaning they are about

00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:07.820
as good as it gets.

00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:10.615
And on the other hand,
they are algorithms.

00:22:10.615 --> 00:22:15.725
They are circuitry for these
things whose cost is close to

00:22:15.725 --> 00:22:18.970
nothing at least today.

00:22:18.970 --> 00:22:21.770
When they were invented, that
was quite different.

00:22:21.770 --> 00:22:25.250
In the '60s, that would have
not been implementable with

00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:27.680
transistors on a board or
something like that.

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:29.920
But today, the cost is
close to nothing.

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:32.380
So the whole algorithmic
treatment of Reed-Solomon

00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:36.000
codes is very well developed.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.570
The encoder you could
do like this.

00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:38.886
Yeah.

00:22:38.886 --> 00:22:40.983
AUDIENCE: Question about why
do you still require that

00:22:40.983 --> 00:22:43.546
degree [INAUDIBLE]?

00:22:43.546 --> 00:22:45.095
PROFESSOR: You don't
need to do that.

00:22:45.095 --> 00:22:47.160
But then the mapping is not
one-to-one anymore.

00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:52.550
Then the mapping is not
one-to-one anymore.

00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:58.170
Let's put it other ways.

00:22:58.170 --> 00:23:00.280
You want code words
of length n.

00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:03.590
If the degree is larger,
you run over.

00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:06.250
In order to still get a code
word, then you have to take it

00:23:06.250 --> 00:23:08.840
modular x to the n minus 1.

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:11.340
And that would fold the
coefficients back.

00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:13.890
And still, it gives you a valid
code word then, but this

00:23:13.890 --> 00:23:16.900
is not one-to-one anymore.

00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:19.980
Anyway, the short answer is if
you allow more, then they

00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:22.160
become longer than n.

00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:29.860
So what's the time?

00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:31.050
OK.

00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:32.880
So this is a nice encoder.

00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:39.730
There even is a nicer encoder,
which I just want to give the

00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:41.950
formula for.

00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:44.540
The one reason that people still
have a problem with this

00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:46.860
is it's not systematic.

00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:52.185
People like to see the symbols
in the code words themselves.

00:23:52.185 --> 00:23:54.226
They want the systematic part.

00:23:54.226 --> 00:23:56.890
How could we achieve that?

00:23:56.890 --> 00:24:00.150
Well, we go from the same
description here.

00:24:00.150 --> 00:24:06.530
We say, well, let
h of x be given.

00:24:09.970 --> 00:24:23.060
Then compute x to the n minus k
times h of x modular g of x.

00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:28.910
So we divide this polynomial
by this polynomial g --

00:24:28.910 --> 00:24:29.860
it has a name.

00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:32.240
It's called the generator
polynomial.

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:34.790
We divide it by g.

00:24:34.790 --> 00:24:43.960
And out comes some polynomial
r of x of some low degree,

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:45.210
degree less than g.

00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:56.900
And degree r of x less than
n minus k in particular.

00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:59.100
So and then we can
form a code word.

00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:05.110
I claim F of x, no, F is --

00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:12.040
and here we write r, and
here we write h.

00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:15.220
The coefficient vector
of h and the

00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:17.870
coefficient vector of r.

00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:20.870
Why is that a code word?

00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:21.850
Why is that a code word?

00:25:21.850 --> 00:25:23.190
Maybe minus here.

00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:25.270
I'm always thinking
characteristic 2 anyway.

00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:28.180
So why is this a code word?

00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:29.430
Anybody, it's clear?

00:25:32.534 --> 00:25:42.970
What this is in terms of F of
x is r of x plus h of x.

00:25:45.545 --> 00:25:48.000
Oh, minus r of x.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.240
That's because we wrote
it like this.

00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:59.870
If we now take the F of x
modular g of x, well, this

00:25:59.870 --> 00:26:02.400
part has degree low.

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:05.130
It's not affected by this
modular operation.

00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:10.820
This would be minus r of x plus
this one, modular g of x,

00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:13.940
which is r of x.

00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:16.860
So the whole thing is 0.

00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:22.000
If this is 0, that means g of
x is a factor of F. Hence,

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.930
it's a code word.

00:26:23.930 --> 00:26:25.650
So we have a code word here.

00:26:25.650 --> 00:26:32.150
And in the code word, pop up
our symbols right away, our

00:26:32.150 --> 00:26:33.960
encoded information symbols
right away.

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:37.770
So we get some nice systematic
encoding going.

00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:40.500
This division circuit by
g is pretty much the

00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:41.790
same size as this.

00:26:41.790 --> 00:26:45.060
It's not larger at all.

00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:46.790
So there, we get beautiful
algorithms.

00:26:46.790 --> 00:26:48.736
This is actually what's
implemented.

00:26:48.736 --> 00:26:51.610
If we go to any disc drive
[UNINTELLIGIBLE], that is

00:26:51.610 --> 00:26:56.610
usually what is implemented
in there, exactly this.

00:26:56.610 --> 00:26:57.990
Algorithms.

00:26:57.990 --> 00:27:00.850
Algorithmic treatment of
Reed-Solomon codes.

00:27:00.850 --> 00:27:03.590
Do you have any questions
about any of this?

00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:04.015
Yeah.

00:27:04.015 --> 00:27:05.370
AUDIENCE: I have a question
about do any these

00:27:05.370 --> 00:27:09.555
Reed-Solomon codes
map [INAUDIBLE]?

00:27:09.555 --> 00:27:11.990
PROFESSOR: They are
very costly map.

00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:14.940
Usually, it depends a lot
on the application.

00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:17.180
If you think disc drives,
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] as just being

00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:21.330
mapped, you take Reed-Solomon
codes over a characteristic 2.

00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:22.760
Then each field element is

00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:25.840
represented as a binary vector.

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:30.460
And that binary vector is mapped
into on-off keying.

00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:32.230
Straight off the bat.

00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:34.560
Nothing more fancy.

00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:40.090
That is for disc drives.

00:27:40.090 --> 00:27:42.710
And as you do this, the
satellite standard, where it's

00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:48.510
mapped onto the 256-QAM field
elements [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:27:48.510 --> 00:27:51.490
So it's many different ways.

00:27:51.490 --> 00:27:53.328
Many different ways.

00:27:53.328 --> 00:27:55.640
AUDIENCE: But to prove some
performance [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:58.980
in the [UNINTELLIGIBLE], we need
to have mappings, right?

00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:01.030
PROFESSOR: In order to prove
performance mode, we need to

00:28:01.030 --> 00:28:02.110
have mappings.

00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:05.700
And the Hamming distance bounds
that we get from here

00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:09.060
give you bounds on the minimum
Euclidean distance.

00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:12.400
If these are good bounds or
not depends a lot on the

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:14.150
modulation scheme.

00:28:14.150 --> 00:28:17.620
And to be perfectly honest,
they usually are not.

00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:21.850
They usually are not very
good, the bounds.

00:28:21.850 --> 00:28:26.350
But it's a very difficult
problem to design a code or to

00:28:26.350 --> 00:28:31.010
find a representation of the
fields that maps nicely onto a

00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:31.965
modulation scheme.

00:28:31.965 --> 00:28:34.725
Very difficult problem.

00:28:34.725 --> 00:28:37.210
AUDIENCE: How do we know
how to think that

00:28:37.210 --> 00:28:38.210
this is a good code?

00:28:38.210 --> 00:28:42.030
PROFESSOR: The code itself is
excellent in terms of MDS, the

00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:43.010
MDS property.

00:28:43.010 --> 00:28:45.070
AUDIENCE: But why does
MDS mean good codes?

00:28:45.070 --> 00:28:46.696
PROFESSOR: In respect
to modulation?

00:28:46.696 --> 00:28:47.580
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:49.490
PROFESSOR: It doesn't.

00:28:49.490 --> 00:28:52.374
It doesn't.

00:28:52.374 --> 00:28:55.390
It's a bit like this.

00:28:55.390 --> 00:28:59.080
It's really not easy to define
codes in Euclidean space.

00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:07.170
So all that we do is we find
ways to do that and guarantee

00:29:07.170 --> 00:29:12.120
some performance, some
sort of performance.

00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:15.400
It's not easy to spread out --

00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:15.910
I don't know --

00:29:15.910 --> 00:29:24.080
2 to the 1,000 points
in 1,500 dimensions.

00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:25.380
These would be typical
numbers really.

00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:31.240
It's not easy.

00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:35.350
And since that problem is
practically daunting, it's a

00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:39.530
daunting task, you have to
develop all sort of crutches

00:29:39.530 --> 00:29:40.210
to do that.

00:29:40.210 --> 00:29:42.290
And this is really one.

00:29:42.290 --> 00:29:46.620
So how to code MDS
codes playing a

00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:48.120
part in this mapping.

00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:52.230
If you want to be more fancy
about that, then you put a

00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:55.440
convolutional code or some other
code also in there and

00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:56.690
do a combine scheme.

00:29:59.670 --> 00:30:02.910
I think Professor Forney will
talk about that more.

00:30:02.910 --> 00:30:05.060
So here, it's just the
coding theoretic

00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:07.550
groundwork of these things.

00:30:10.610 --> 00:30:11.090
Anything else?

00:30:11.090 --> 00:30:11.565
Yeah.

00:30:11.565 --> 00:30:12.900
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:15.390
of the [INAUDIBLE] n minus 1.

00:30:15.390 --> 00:30:17.507
Close, very close [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:17.507 --> 00:30:18.757
PROFESSOR: Yeah, thanks.

00:30:24.050 --> 00:30:28.780
So the algorithmic treatment
of Reed-Solomon codes is

00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:29.980
extremely elegant.

00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:34.675
And that's the second main
reason they are so much used.

00:30:34.675 --> 00:30:37.990
It doesn't cost so much
to implement them.

00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:40.210
Well, at least we've seen
that for the encoder.

00:30:40.210 --> 00:30:42.130
That's a fairly small circuit.

00:30:42.130 --> 00:30:43.380
So what about decoding?

00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:51.650
Decoding.

00:30:51.650 --> 00:30:53.350
How do we decode these things?

00:30:57.990 --> 00:31:00.400
How could we possibly
decode them?

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:02.390
And I give you --

00:31:02.390 --> 00:31:04.840
AUDIENCE: Fourier?

00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:05.660
PROFESSOR: Right, that's true.

00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:06.930
We could do the Fourier
transform.

00:31:06.930 --> 00:31:13.026
But it doesn't help us so much
because we receive something.

00:31:13.026 --> 00:31:16.540
And we receive a
vector, say, y.

00:31:20.962 --> 00:31:23.323
From now on, let's say
x is a code word.

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:28.750
rs, right.

00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:32.590
So x, it's usually a code
word from now on.

00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:37.190
So this is a code word
plus an error.

00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:39.740
So in particular, if we take the
Fourier transform, we take

00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:42.110
the Fourier transform of the
code word, which is fine.

00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:43.590
But then we get the Fourier
transform of the error.

00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:46.780
So that destroys all the fun.

00:31:49.370 --> 00:31:50.110
What else could we do?

00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:54.250
Here's typical parameters
of a code.

00:31:54.250 --> 00:32:01.740
255, 239, 256.

00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:04.100
And you immediately see
that, OK, any sort of

00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:05.350
group force is out.

00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:10.490
How many code words
do we have here?

00:32:10.490 --> 00:32:13.622
We have 8 to the
239 code words.

00:32:13.622 --> 00:32:16.042
Now you don't want
to search that.

00:32:16.042 --> 00:32:18.386
You definitely don't want
to search that.

00:32:22.690 --> 00:32:25.536
So how could we possibly
decode these things?

00:32:28.790 --> 00:32:32.070
Turns out, to decode them in
some sort of optimal fashion,

00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:33.160
maximum likelihood [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:37.220
actually, it's an
NP-hard problem.

00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:41.140
Maybe last year, actually, it
has been shown that it's an

00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:44.190
NP-hard problem to decode
Reed-Solomon codes.

00:32:44.190 --> 00:32:47.110
It was known that decoding
in general was NP-hard.

00:32:47.110 --> 00:32:51.930
But this is now the constraint
to Reed-Solomon

00:32:51.930 --> 00:32:55.200
codes is still hard.

00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:56.940
So what do we do?

00:32:56.940 --> 00:32:59.640
Yes, OK, what do we do?

00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:01.800
Let's say x is a code word.

00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:05.170
We know that.

00:33:05.170 --> 00:33:09.560
And set rate e, let's
just call it t.

00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:23.390
So what happens if you
don't have an error?

00:33:23.390 --> 00:33:24.640
Just thought experiment.

00:33:28.630 --> 00:33:34.520
Thought experiment, if you don't
have an error, then yi

00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:46.640
in all the positions is
equal to F of xi for

00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:49.500
some F of x of degree.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.520
In particular, since we
know the x's, we know

00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:03.770
the positions --

00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:14.600
sorry, oh, sorry.

00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:17.050
That's not what I
wanted to write.

00:34:17.050 --> 00:34:18.864
This is definitely not what
I wanted to write.

00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:38.870
Let's keep that as c as a code
word and position i in c is

00:34:38.870 --> 00:34:49.679
associated with xi
in the fields.

00:34:49.679 --> 00:34:57.340
So meaning ci would
be F of xi.

00:34:57.340 --> 00:34:59.310
That's really what I
wanted to write.

00:34:59.310 --> 00:35:01.810
It makes more sense.

00:35:01.810 --> 00:35:03.710
So thought experiment.

00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:04.960
No errors.

00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:16.170
Then yi is F of xi for some F.
If they ran no errors, then we

00:35:16.170 --> 00:35:21.900
could just solve this linear
system of equations to find

00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:26.360
the coefficient of F. And the
coefficient of F, say, were

00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:28.286
our information circuits.

00:35:28.286 --> 00:35:32.100
Is it clear that this is a
linear system of equations?

00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:34.380
Yeah?

00:35:34.380 --> 00:35:40.680
You could write it out as
y0, y1, y2 equal to --

00:35:56.490 --> 00:36:01.260
and here we have f0,
f1, up to fk-1.

00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:03.110
This is the linear system
of equations.

00:36:03.110 --> 00:36:04.510
We know the xi's.

00:36:04.510 --> 00:36:05.960
This is a linear system of
equation we have to solve.

00:36:11.170 --> 00:36:13.560
If there are no errors,
then life is easy.

00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:15.360
That seems to be reasonable.

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:17.820
So what happens if we
do have errors?

00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:23.810
Somehow, we have to make sure
that the errors that we get do

00:36:23.810 --> 00:36:27.590
not cause any problem for us.

00:36:27.590 --> 00:36:33.950
And then we do something
very ingenious.

00:36:33.950 --> 00:36:37.825
We define something called an
error locator which is a

00:36:37.825 --> 00:36:55.470
polynomial x such
that x minus xi.

00:36:55.470 --> 00:37:01.400
So it's a polynomial which is
0 in all error positions.

00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:07.270
Well, you might say, we do not
know the error positions.

00:37:07.270 --> 00:37:09.750
Well, OK, that's true.

00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:12.480
Basically, this is, in the end,
what we want to find,

00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:13.150
this polynomial.

00:37:13.150 --> 00:37:14.835
But nonetheless, this
polynomial exists.

00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:25.990
We can cast, actually,
the coding problem --

00:37:25.990 --> 00:37:29.170
this is form 1 s.

00:37:32.695 --> 00:37:35.032
Yes, what?

00:37:35.032 --> 00:37:36.282
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE PHRASE].

00:37:42.130 --> 00:37:43.480
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it's an
additive error model.

00:37:46.510 --> 00:37:48.330
But you can cast pretty
much anything in the

00:37:48.330 --> 00:37:49.140
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:52.440
If a position is altered, you
can always model that as if

00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:53.754
something was added to it.

00:37:56.480 --> 00:38:09.670
Decoding problem one is find
lambda of x of minimal degree

00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:30.800
such that lambda of xi,
is 0 for all xi and

00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:35.230
degree f less than k.

00:38:35.230 --> 00:38:41.750
So I claim if you solve this
problem, namely, this is a

00:38:41.750 --> 00:38:44.570
problem I give you.

00:38:44.570 --> 00:38:47.000
I give you vector y.

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.335
I give you vector y.

00:38:48.335 --> 00:38:48.890
Here it is.

00:38:48.890 --> 00:38:50.380
Here is vector y.

00:38:50.380 --> 00:38:53.500
And I give you vector x which
corresponds to the field

00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:56.310
elements where you evaluated
that in order to

00:38:56.310 --> 00:38:57.540
get the code word.

00:38:57.540 --> 00:39:02.760
And then I said, given y and x,
find two polynomials lambda

00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:09.180
and f such that f has maximum
degree k and lambda has

00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:12.730
minimum degree, the smaller
degree possible so

00:39:12.730 --> 00:39:15.360
that this is true.

00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:19.140
And I claim this solves
the decoding problem.

00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:22.340
This would solve the decoding
problem because once we have

00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:24.910
found this, then we
can take lambda to

00:39:24.910 --> 00:39:27.140
be the error locator.

00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:32.480
And we can basically read
off the information

00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:35.180
symbols from the f.

00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:38.810
So this decoding formulation now
brings it, at least, into

00:39:38.810 --> 00:39:42.780
the algebraic ground, brings
the whole decoding problem,

00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:45.072
makes it something
algebraically.

00:39:45.072 --> 00:39:49.220
But now the question becomes,
is that easy?

00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:50.890
Or can we do this?

00:39:50.890 --> 00:39:52.140
This problem here.

00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:56.670
Do you see any hope for
solving this problem?

00:40:02.270 --> 00:40:05.290
I guess the only
answer that --

00:40:05.290 --> 00:40:06.660
OK, anybody says no?

00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:10.072
Anybody does not see any hope?

00:40:10.072 --> 00:40:10.950
All right.

00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:11.750
This is great.

00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:14.940
You all see hope here.

00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:18.380
You all see hope here, which
seems to make you an

00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:20.166
opportunistic bunch.

00:40:20.166 --> 00:40:21.360
Not opportunistic.

00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:22.350
What's the word?

00:40:22.350 --> 00:40:22.930
Optimistic.

00:40:22.930 --> 00:40:24.180
Optimistic bunch.

00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:27.270
Let's put it like this.

00:40:27.270 --> 00:40:29.333
What is the problem
in solving this?

00:40:31.991 --> 00:40:34.270
It's not linear.

00:40:34.270 --> 00:40:35.890
You get the coefficients
of lambda.

00:40:35.890 --> 00:40:38.390
Multiply the coefficients
of f.

00:40:38.390 --> 00:40:44.900
That whole thing becomes a
nonlinear problem, where we

00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:51.490
say in the end, find the
solution to a set of

00:40:51.490 --> 00:40:57.400
polynomial equations in a field,
which is a multivariate

00:40:57.400 --> 00:41:00.390
polynomial equations, where the
coefficients of lambda and

00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:02.680
f are the variables.

00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:03.540
You can do that.

00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:06.400
You could use techniques like
Grobner basis or so, and you

00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:07.720
could do that.

00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:09.020
But this is very difficult.

00:41:09.020 --> 00:41:11.805
This is computationally
tedious.

00:41:15.710 --> 00:41:18.930
So is that clear why this is
nonlinear, and why this is

00:41:18.930 --> 00:41:20.780
hard to solve a nonlinear
problem here?

00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:27.830
If not, then you have to say
something now, or forever hold

00:41:27.830 --> 00:41:29.080
your peace.

00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:38.350
So what do we do with
hard problems?

00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:44.920
Once you take the optimization
classes, there's almost like a

00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:47.320
reflex, there is a relax time.

00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:49.870
We find the proper relaxation
of the problem.

00:41:49.870 --> 00:41:53.450
Now the proper relaxation of
this problem is the following.

00:42:00.690 --> 00:42:03.150
Decoding problem two.

00:42:03.150 --> 00:42:17.865
Find lambda of x of minimal
degree such that --

00:42:17.865 --> 00:42:21.760
it's almost the same,
almost the same --

00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:39.460
lambda fi yi minus h of xi is
0, where the degree of h is

00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:48.820
less than k plus
degree lambda.

00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:52.370
So all that we did from this
formulation, which would give

00:42:52.370 --> 00:42:55.560
us a clean solution to the whole
thing, right now, we

00:42:55.560 --> 00:43:00.350
multiply in this lambda which
gives here, it keeps the

00:43:00.350 --> 00:43:02.060
lambda times y.

00:43:02.060 --> 00:43:05.370
And here, we get a new
polynomial, lambda times f,

00:43:05.370 --> 00:43:11.800
which now has degree at most
k plus degree lambda.

00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:15.760
And then we say, let's instead
solve this problem.

00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:18.130
Let's solve this problem.

00:43:18.130 --> 00:43:32.800
In particular, the question now
becomes well, we do not

00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:35.000
require this anymore.

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:39.870
In this relaxed formulation,
we do not require this.

00:43:39.870 --> 00:43:41.800
And that makes all
the difference.

00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:45.836
It makes a world of difference
because this one --

00:43:45.836 --> 00:43:49.470
look at it -- it's
a linear problem.

00:43:49.470 --> 00:43:50.760
It's a linear program.

00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:51.880
Why is it a linear problem?

00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:53.375
Do you see it's a
linear problem?

00:43:56.020 --> 00:44:00.180
Could you write down the
equation, the matrix equation?

00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:01.430
It's pretty straight, right?

00:44:04.690 --> 00:44:05.730
It's pretty straight.

00:44:05.730 --> 00:44:09.340
You could, for example,
write it like, here, a

00:44:09.340 --> 00:44:14.285
diagonal matrix yn.

00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:18.280
Here, you would get something.

00:44:26.688 --> 00:44:28.590
I think that seems
to be all right.

00:44:35.710 --> 00:44:39.070
And here, just the evaluation
of the h.

00:44:39.070 --> 00:45:00.330
So up to hk plus
degree lambda.

00:45:00.330 --> 00:45:03.070
That's a linear system
of equations.

00:45:03.070 --> 00:45:04.330
We can certainly solve this.

00:45:04.330 --> 00:45:08.340
Well, we do not know really
what the lambda is, what

00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:10.180
degree the lambda has.

00:45:10.180 --> 00:45:12.720
But we're just hypothesizing on
all the possible degrees.

00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:21.915
Well, we could say, OK, let's
assume the degree lambda is 0.

00:45:21.915 --> 00:45:24.740
It's a constant, which would
be the same as saying there

00:45:24.740 --> 00:45:27.520
are no errors.

00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:29.120
Then we can look at the
system of equations.

00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:30.120
Does it have a solution?

00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:31.380
Well, yes, no.

00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:34.300
If no, then we say, all right,
let's assume it's 1.

00:45:34.300 --> 00:45:35.370
Well, does it have a solution?

00:45:35.370 --> 00:45:36.250
Yes, no.

00:45:36.250 --> 00:45:36.860
And so on.

00:45:36.860 --> 00:45:38.110
Then we can move on.

00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:43.210
So we can solve this
relaxed problem.

00:45:46.610 --> 00:45:48.580
Does that help us?

00:45:48.580 --> 00:45:50.500
It's nice to solve a
relaxed problem.

00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:52.540
And in the end, we get two
vectors out of it, two

00:45:52.540 --> 00:45:57.620
polynomials, lambda and h.

00:45:57.620 --> 00:45:58.870
Does it really help us?

00:46:02.290 --> 00:46:06.635
Well, yes.

00:46:06.635 --> 00:46:08.390
Why?

00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:09.240
Because --

00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:10.490
let's put it like this.

00:46:12.930 --> 00:46:16.960
We could easily check
if this is true.

00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:20.860
Once we have our h, we can
easily check if this is true.

00:46:20.860 --> 00:46:25.760
And if it is true, then we
have solved this problem.

00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:28.430
If it is true, we have solved
this problem, which is the

00:46:28.430 --> 00:46:31.350
problem we wanted to solve.

00:46:31.350 --> 00:46:32.600
Good.

00:46:40.170 --> 00:46:41.870
So is that all we need
to know about this?

00:46:50.390 --> 00:46:51.950
We want to give guarantees.

00:46:51.950 --> 00:46:55.380
We want to give guarantees that
we correct up to so many

00:46:55.380 --> 00:46:56.991
errors, t errors, right?

00:46:59.580 --> 00:47:03.390
So we have to guarantee that if
there are not more than t

00:47:03.390 --> 00:47:08.600
errors, whatever t will turn
out to be, we can guarantee

00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:12.460
that A, we will find
a solution, and

00:47:12.460 --> 00:47:15.570
B, this will hold.

00:47:15.570 --> 00:47:17.815
So two things to prove.

00:47:17.815 --> 00:47:18.880
Is that clear?

00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:21.360
That we have to prove
those two things?

00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:24.020
So the first one first.

00:47:27.430 --> 00:47:34.970
When do we find a solution?

00:47:34.970 --> 00:47:36.465
And are we guaranteed
to find it?

00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:50.280
Can we guarantee the existence
of a solution?

00:47:55.400 --> 00:47:58.050
Well, when can we do that?

00:47:58.050 --> 00:48:00.390
Let's look at this.

00:48:00.390 --> 00:48:02.240
These are n constraints.

00:48:05.390 --> 00:48:09.350
This is a system of linear
equations with n constraints.

00:48:09.350 --> 00:48:17.420
If the total number of degrees
of freedom exceeds n, then we

00:48:17.420 --> 00:48:19.790
are left with something
non-trivial after we solve the

00:48:19.790 --> 00:48:21.060
system of equations.

00:48:21.060 --> 00:48:23.880
So what's the total number
of degrees of freedom?

00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:28.100
The number of degrees
of freedom --

00:48:33.100 --> 00:48:39.920
so we get the lambda as a degree
of freedom, so which is

00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:44.030
degree lambda plus 1.

00:48:44.030 --> 00:48:46.720
And the other one is plus --

00:48:49.510 --> 00:48:51.910
what is this one --

00:48:51.910 --> 00:48:58.930
plus k plus degree lambda.

00:48:58.930 --> 00:49:04.140
This is the total number of
degrees of freedom here.

00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:08.550
And the reason is that this
one should be minus 1.

00:49:08.550 --> 00:49:09.800
Sorry.

00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:13.320
So this is total number
of degrees of freedom.

00:49:18.505 --> 00:49:21.580
If this is greater than n,
then we can guarantee the

00:49:21.580 --> 00:49:23.445
existence of a solution,
a nontrivial solution.

00:49:23.445 --> 00:49:26.690
Then this thing will
have a solution.

00:49:26.690 --> 00:49:28.620
It's a homogeneous system
of equations.

00:49:28.620 --> 00:49:30.110
So the 0 is always a solution.

00:49:30.110 --> 00:49:33.200
But that's not much
good to us.

00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:35.458
So what do we get here?

00:49:35.458 --> 00:49:37.930
Degree lambda.

00:49:37.930 --> 00:49:44.580
To a degree lambda greater
than n minus k plus minus

00:49:44.580 --> 00:49:49.130
1 or n minus k.

00:49:52.470 --> 00:49:58.770
So the degree lambda greater
than n minus k over 2 -- does

00:49:58.770 --> 00:50:00.100
that remind you of
anything here?

00:50:04.770 --> 00:50:14.950
So this one is d
minus 1 over 2.

00:50:14.950 --> 00:50:16.700
So very interesting, right?

00:50:16.700 --> 00:50:20.460
Once upon a time, you learned
that if you make less than d/2

00:50:20.460 --> 00:50:23.760
errors, you can correct that.

00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:24.040
Very nice.

00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:26.780
It pops up here.

00:50:26.780 --> 00:50:29.520
It pops up here out
of the blue.

00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:32.260
The reason that it pops up here
is, of course, the same

00:50:32.260 --> 00:50:36.730
statement, that as long as we
stay within d/2 errors, we are

00:50:36.730 --> 00:50:38.580
guaranteed to be able
to decode this.

00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:42.030
So this is one.

00:50:42.030 --> 00:50:45.630
So we know this one was
the number of errors.

00:50:45.630 --> 00:50:48.540
If t is greater or equal
than this, then --

00:50:58.010 --> 00:51:01.220
let's forget about the t.

00:51:01.220 --> 00:51:03.810
If you proceed in this algorithm
hypothesizing the

00:51:03.810 --> 00:51:09.100
degrees of lambda, once we've
reached this number in the

00:51:09.100 --> 00:51:11.150
degree, there will
be a solution.

00:51:11.150 --> 00:51:12.650
And we don't have to go
further than that.

00:51:16.380 --> 00:51:18.190
So that's the first one.

00:51:18.190 --> 00:51:21.880
So the second thing we have
to prove is that --

00:51:21.880 --> 00:51:23.130
I shouldn't have done this --

00:51:29.190 --> 00:51:30.320
that for some t --

00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:30.784
Yeah?

00:51:30.784 --> 00:51:33.104
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:33.104 --> 00:51:36.360
standard degree of freedom
or less constraints?

00:51:36.360 --> 00:51:38.310
PROFESSOR: You want to
guarantee a solution.

00:51:38.310 --> 00:51:41.750
If you have more constraints
than degrees of freedom, then,

00:51:41.750 --> 00:51:44.670
since it's homogeneous, you
usually would be stuck with a

00:51:44.670 --> 00:51:45.490
zero solution.

00:51:45.490 --> 00:51:49.520
Everything's 0, which
is no good to us.

00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:52.510
It solves this problem, but
it doesn't give us any

00:51:52.510 --> 00:51:55.305
information.

00:51:55.305 --> 00:51:56.622
Is that all right?

00:52:00.066 --> 00:52:02.772
AUDIENCE: Why does it have to be
the condition that degrees

00:52:02.772 --> 00:52:06.970
of freedom has to be greater
than the constraints?

00:52:06.970 --> 00:52:09.400
PROFESSOR: No, no, the
degrees of freedom --

00:52:09.400 --> 00:52:13.460
well, OK, it's true.

00:52:13.460 --> 00:52:16.580
We could get lucky.

00:52:16.580 --> 00:52:20.030
We could have redundancy in
this system of equations.

00:52:20.030 --> 00:52:24.780
And if we get lucky, that's
just for the better.

00:52:24.780 --> 00:52:29.260
And actually, you can show that
you do get lucky if very

00:52:29.260 --> 00:52:31.250
few errors happen.

00:52:31.250 --> 00:52:34.260
Then this would have low rank.

00:52:34.260 --> 00:52:35.370
You can show that.

00:52:35.370 --> 00:52:39.430
But short of knowing much,
we want to guarantee --

00:52:39.430 --> 00:52:42.380
I just want, at this point in
time, to guarantee that there

00:52:42.380 --> 00:52:44.370
is a solution.

00:52:44.370 --> 00:52:47.590
There is a non-zero solution to
this system of equations,

00:52:47.590 --> 00:52:50.710
and the degree of lambda
is not more than d

00:52:50.710 --> 00:52:53.460
minus 1 over 2.

00:52:53.460 --> 00:52:56.690
There is a solution with a
degree of lambda being upper

00:52:56.690 --> 00:52:58.324
bounded by this.

00:52:58.324 --> 00:52:59.800
AUDIENCE: So [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:59.800 --> 00:53:01.280
less constraints?

00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:02.530
PROFESSOR: Yeah, no, no.

00:53:06.550 --> 00:53:08.660
Once this is satisfied,
I guarantee

00:53:08.660 --> 00:53:10.260
you there is a solution.

00:53:10.260 --> 00:53:14.420
That means, the smallest
solution is guaranteed not to

00:53:14.420 --> 00:53:15.670
be larger than that.

00:53:19.090 --> 00:53:20.150
But there are, of course, many,

00:53:20.150 --> 00:53:21.570
many more larger solutions.

00:53:21.570 --> 00:53:25.723
There are many solutions of
larger degree here, which we

00:53:25.723 --> 00:53:27.550
are not interested in since
we are interested

00:53:27.550 --> 00:53:30.370
in the minimal degree.

00:53:30.370 --> 00:53:32.750
So this is an upper bound on
the minimal degree lambda.

00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:38.300
So now the other one.

00:53:38.300 --> 00:53:46.630
So now we want to make the
statement about this one here.

00:53:46.630 --> 00:53:52.990
When can we guarantee that our
relaxation didn't matter?

00:53:52.990 --> 00:53:56.930
Despite our relaxation, our
solution that we find that in

00:53:56.930 --> 00:54:00.110
the solution that we find
lambda divides h.

00:54:00.110 --> 00:54:03.430
How can we guarantee this?

00:54:03.430 --> 00:54:04.860
So how can we guarantee this?

00:54:04.860 --> 00:54:06.110
How can we guarantee this?

00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:20.310
Let's look at lambda xi
yi minus h of xi.

00:54:20.310 --> 00:54:24.610
And we know this is
0 for all xi.

00:54:24.610 --> 00:54:25.860
We know that.

00:54:29.210 --> 00:54:38.780
We know that this guy here can
actually be written as ci plus

00:54:38.780 --> 00:54:43.630
ei minus h of xi.

00:54:47.690 --> 00:54:50.040
This is just expanding
this guy.

00:54:50.040 --> 00:55:00.790
We also know that we can write
lambda xi times ci alone minus

00:55:00.790 --> 00:55:08.051
f of xi lambda xi.

00:55:08.051 --> 00:55:08.520
This is 0.

00:55:08.520 --> 00:55:10.932
We know that this is true too.

00:55:10.932 --> 00:55:12.780
AUDIENCE: For some f.

00:55:12.780 --> 00:55:13.320
PROFESSOR: For some f.

00:55:13.320 --> 00:55:17.220
The text is to f, so that
this is true too.

00:55:17.220 --> 00:55:22.500
Then let's just subtract
these two guys.

00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:25.480
Let's just subtract these
two things here.

00:55:25.480 --> 00:55:36.460
And then we know that lambda
xi times ei --

00:55:36.460 --> 00:55:38.250
so the first two cancel --

00:55:38.250 --> 00:55:51.646
minus h of xi minus So we
know this is true too.

00:55:51.646 --> 00:55:53.550
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:53.550 --> 00:55:56.210
PROFESSOR: Yeah, sorry.

00:55:56.210 --> 00:55:57.460
Just in time.

00:56:01.220 --> 00:56:02.480
So what can we learn
from this?

00:56:02.480 --> 00:56:05.510
So what is the degree of this?

00:56:05.510 --> 00:56:07.780
What is the degree of this?

00:56:07.780 --> 00:56:09.570
Well, this guy here --

00:56:09.570 --> 00:56:10.820
we'll write it somewhere
else --

00:56:37.550 --> 00:56:47.320
well, this guy had degree h was
less than n minus k plus

00:56:47.320 --> 00:56:57.310
degree lambda less than
k plus degree lambda.

00:56:57.310 --> 00:57:00.760
That's because we set up
that problem that way.

00:57:00.760 --> 00:57:10.740
And we know that this
guy degree lambda.

00:57:13.780 --> 00:57:15.740
We know that.

00:57:15.740 --> 00:57:28.390
So this whole thing, let's call
it S. We know it's 0 for

00:57:28.390 --> 00:57:35.360
degree S less than
degree lambda.

00:57:39.080 --> 00:57:41.730
So why does that help us?

00:57:41.730 --> 00:57:44.740
Well, let's look
at the vector.

00:57:44.740 --> 00:57:48.060
Now let's look at all
the positions.

00:57:48.060 --> 00:57:53.380
Let's look at the vector where
we had, in the vector, we have

00:57:53.380 --> 00:57:56.770
lambda xi ei.

00:58:02.620 --> 00:58:05.480
And now the fundamental
question.

00:58:05.480 --> 00:58:09.450
What is the rate
of this vector?

00:58:09.450 --> 00:58:10.700
At most?

00:58:13.400 --> 00:58:15.147
What's the rate of
this guy at most?

00:58:18.883 --> 00:58:20.133
It's 12 seconds,
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]?

00:58:25.740 --> 00:58:28.860
Well, the rate of
this vector --

00:58:37.030 --> 00:58:40.410
it's definitely not more than
the rate of the error.

00:58:40.410 --> 00:58:44.260
Because every time the error
is 0, the rate drops out.

00:58:44.260 --> 00:58:45.510
That's at most t.

00:58:48.890 --> 00:58:52.660
What is the rate
of this vector?

00:58:52.660 --> 00:59:01.170
So here we have a vector on
the other side, S of xi, a

00:59:01.170 --> 00:59:04.240
vector on the other side.

00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:05.490
What's the rate of this guy?

00:59:08.790 --> 00:59:13.810
That's just the polynomial of
degree at most k plus degree

00:59:13.810 --> 00:59:15.640
lambda minus 1.

00:59:15.640 --> 00:59:29.940
So we have that the rate of this
vector is n minus k plus

00:59:29.940 --> 00:59:35.617
degree lambda minus 1 plus
1 because of the minus.

00:59:35.617 --> 00:59:39.230
AUDIENCE: Greater than
or equal to?

00:59:39.230 --> 00:59:41.660
PROFESSOR: It's greater
than or equal, sorry.

00:59:41.660 --> 00:59:43.580
Otherwise, I would have been in
trouble in a second here.

00:59:46.350 --> 00:59:47.800
Yeah, so what does that mean?

00:59:47.800 --> 00:59:51.710
So actually, this one is nice
to rewrite is equal to d n

00:59:51.710 --> 00:59:55.865
minus t plus 1 d --

00:59:55.865 --> 01:00:00.320
I really should have done it
like this in order not to --

01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:05.010
it's d minus degree lambda.

01:00:08.230 --> 01:00:09.550
So what can we learn
from that?

01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:19.300
So we know this is true
for all the positions.

01:00:19.300 --> 01:00:24.060
So if this is true for all
positions, then --

01:00:24.060 --> 01:00:30.070
so if d minus degree lambda --

01:00:30.070 --> 01:00:34.480
actually, this is t because
the rate was defined.

01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:37.250
t was the number of errors.

01:00:37.250 --> 01:00:39.830
And the error locator was just
defined to have degree t.

01:00:43.650 --> 01:00:45.390
Right?

01:00:45.390 --> 01:00:49.480
The error locator was just x
minus xi over all positions

01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:50.890
where we had an error, so there

01:00:50.890 --> 01:00:51.950
are t of those positions.

01:00:51.950 --> 01:00:55.550
The degree of lambda
is equal to t.

01:00:55.550 --> 01:00:56.490
So now we take this.

01:00:56.490 --> 01:01:07.410
If d minus t is greater than
t, so if the rate of this

01:01:07.410 --> 01:01:13.720
vector is greater than the rate
of this vector, then we

01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:18.030
have a problem because
that cannot be.

01:01:18.030 --> 01:01:19.840
Of course, by this identity,
the rate of these

01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:22.520
two vectors is equal.

01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:23.770
So what is the way out?

01:01:26.660 --> 01:01:27.550
What's the way out?

01:01:27.550 --> 01:01:28.800
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:01:33.286 --> 01:01:33.770
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:01:33.770 --> 01:01:53.090
So if this is true, then S of
xi I claim has to be 0 and

01:01:53.090 --> 01:02:01.100
lambda of xi times ei has
to be 0 too for all i.

01:02:03.860 --> 01:02:06.460
That's the only way
out of this.

01:02:06.460 --> 01:02:08.760
Because, obviously,
this was allowed.

01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:11.760
If we really did find what we
wanted to find, namely, an

01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:15.530
error locator here, then
this vector --

01:02:15.530 --> 01:02:17.410
we said it has to
be less than t.

01:02:17.410 --> 01:02:18.570
It can be less.

01:02:18.570 --> 01:02:22.460
In particular, it can
be 0 if this is,

01:02:22.460 --> 01:02:24.710
indeed, an error locator.

01:02:24.710 --> 01:02:28.820
And if our relaxation
didn't matter --

01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:34.800
that means the h that we
find factors as that --

01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:38.480
if the relaxation didn't matter,
then S would be 0 too.

01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:39.830
So that is a fair solution.

01:02:39.830 --> 01:02:41.970
That's a possibility.

01:02:41.970 --> 01:02:48.450
And if d minus t is greater than
t, then this proves this

01:02:48.450 --> 01:02:51.300
is the only solution
that is feasible.

01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:54.180
That's the only solution
you have.

01:02:54.180 --> 01:03:03.480
So what that means is if t
less than t/2, then the

01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:20.040
relaxation doesn't matter and h
of xi is equal to lambda of

01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:21.568
xi times f of xi.

01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:35.040
So is that clear?

01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:44.380
That's two very simple, yet
nice ways to prove things.

01:03:44.380 --> 01:03:45.750
Here, we guarantee
the solution.

01:03:49.450 --> 01:03:51.610
Here, we guarantee
the solution.

01:03:51.610 --> 01:03:55.330
Here, we guarantee that solution
is correct, namely,

01:03:55.330 --> 01:03:59.760
if not too many errors happen,
if less than t/2 errors

01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:06.370
happens, then relaxing the
original problem here to this

01:04:06.370 --> 01:04:08.360
other form, which we
could solve, does

01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:11.690
not change the solution.

01:04:11.690 --> 01:04:12.940
That's what's proved there.

01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:21.270
But about one-third
looks puzzled.

01:04:21.270 --> 01:04:23.130
About half looks puzzled,
I would think.

01:04:29.490 --> 01:04:30.900
Half looks puzzled.

01:04:30.900 --> 01:04:33.870
Is there any way I can
explain that better?

01:04:33.870 --> 01:04:35.120
Think.

01:04:42.790 --> 01:04:46.980
Let's just go through
the steps quickly.

01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:50.640
We had problem number one.

01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:56.350
Problem number one, which is a
nonlinear problem, but you see

01:04:56.350 --> 01:04:59.170
that if you could solve
this, you could solve

01:04:59.170 --> 01:05:01.800
the decoding problem.

01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:03.760
So you see that.

01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:06.760
Anybody who doesn't see that?

01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:07.090
All right.

01:05:07.090 --> 01:05:08.340
You're smart guys.

01:05:11.130 --> 01:05:13.740
If we can solve problem number
one, we are home free.

01:05:13.740 --> 01:05:15.300
We have solved the
decoding problem.

01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:16.270
Fine, we cannot solve it.

01:05:16.270 --> 01:05:17.640
It's a nonlinear problem.

01:05:17.640 --> 01:05:21.110
Well, we can solve it in
exponential time, but that's

01:05:21.110 --> 01:05:23.410
little fun.

01:05:23.410 --> 01:05:24.320
So we relax it.

01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:28.730
We relax it into problem
number two.

01:05:28.730 --> 01:05:31.444
All that we do, we multiply
things out.

01:05:31.444 --> 01:05:37.510
And we do not require,
once we solve the

01:05:37.510 --> 01:05:38.760
problem, this anymore.

01:05:46.530 --> 01:05:48.490
Now we have solved
this problem.

01:05:48.490 --> 01:05:51.520
We have solved this linear
system of equations.

01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:59.640
And after doing so, we have
found lambda and h.

01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:02.470
They are lying on the table
and looking at us.

01:06:02.470 --> 01:06:03.610
Now what?

01:06:03.610 --> 01:06:04.820
Are they any good?

01:06:04.820 --> 01:06:08.950
In particular, since a priori we
cannot guarantee that this

01:06:08.950 --> 01:06:13.170
relaxation didn't completely
destroy everything.

01:06:13.170 --> 01:06:14.410
We have solved the system.

01:06:14.410 --> 01:06:17.040
Now those two things are lying
on the table, looking at us,

01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:19.650
and asking, what am I?

01:06:19.650 --> 01:06:23.380
And in general, if there's an
arbitrary amount of errors

01:06:23.380 --> 01:06:27.430
happening near the channel,
actually,

01:06:27.430 --> 01:06:29.340
they do not mean much.

01:06:29.340 --> 01:06:32.900
They do not mean much.

01:06:32.900 --> 01:06:38.286
But now I claim that, well, if
not too many errors happened,

01:06:38.286 --> 01:06:43.490
but if the number of errors is
bounded to be this, less than

01:06:43.490 --> 01:06:47.610
half the minimum distance, then,
actually, I claim it did

01:06:47.610 --> 01:06:49.870
not matter if we solved
the relaxation or

01:06:49.870 --> 01:06:52.260
the original problem.

01:06:52.260 --> 01:06:55.880
And the argument is
roughly this.

01:06:55.880 --> 01:06:58.135
It goes like this.

01:06:58.135 --> 01:06:59.890
Here, we start.

01:06:59.890 --> 01:07:01.460
We have solved this.

01:07:01.460 --> 01:07:06.370
We have two polynomials lambda
and h, so that this is true

01:07:06.370 --> 01:07:07.620
for all xi.

01:07:10.380 --> 01:07:12.440
We know that we can write
it like this.

01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:15.290
That's just by definition
of yi, just

01:07:15.290 --> 01:07:18.980
expanding the yi into this.

01:07:18.980 --> 01:07:22.400
We know that this is true by
the definition of the code.

01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:27.500
The ci is the evaluation of
f, of some polynomial f.

01:07:27.500 --> 01:07:31.770
So we can write this just by
definition of the code.

01:07:31.770 --> 01:07:36.430
So once we have these two guys
here, we can subtract them

01:07:36.430 --> 01:07:37.680
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] here.

01:07:39.930 --> 01:07:44.500
So we know that we have solved
the following problem.

01:07:44.500 --> 01:07:49.000
We have found lambda and h.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:57.580
So that there is guaranteed to
exist the polynomial f, so

01:07:57.580 --> 01:08:02.580
that this whole thing, namely,
S of xi, that S is a

01:08:02.580 --> 01:08:04.470
polynomial of degree
at most --

01:08:04.470 --> 01:08:06.130
what did we have --

01:08:06.130 --> 01:08:09.790
k plus degree lambda minus 1.

01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:18.550
So that's a semi-hairy
step here.

01:08:18.550 --> 01:08:24.700
Is that clear that we can
guarantee the existence of a

01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:34.340
polynomial S of degree at most
k plus degree lambda minus 1?

01:08:34.340 --> 01:08:38.320
So that this equation holds.

01:08:43.229 --> 01:08:45.609
Once we have solved this,
we can guarantee the

01:08:45.609 --> 01:08:46.890
existence of this.

01:08:46.890 --> 01:08:48.939
That's what we're saying.

01:08:48.939 --> 01:08:51.029
We can guarantee the
existence of this.

01:08:51.029 --> 01:08:53.819
So now look at this.

01:08:53.819 --> 01:08:58.319
If you write this out for all
i's and put it in a vector,

01:08:58.319 --> 01:09:00.620
what's the rate of
this vector?

01:09:00.620 --> 01:09:05.630
Well, it's at most t because
all the other e's are 0.

01:09:05.630 --> 01:09:08.890
If lambda is an error
locator, it is 0.

01:09:08.890 --> 01:09:10.740
But we do not know that yet.

01:09:10.740 --> 01:09:12.330
All we know, it's at most t.

01:09:15.149 --> 01:09:18.939
This is on this side, so that
vector has a rate at most t.

01:09:18.939 --> 01:09:25.660
On this side, the rate of this
vector is at least this.

01:09:25.660 --> 01:09:28.939
Just by evaluating a polynomial
of this degree,

01:09:28.939 --> 01:09:31.193
this is the maximum number
of 0's we can get.

01:09:34.350 --> 01:09:41.740
So now we have two equalities,
this one and this one.

01:09:41.740 --> 01:09:45.330
But obviously, the two vectors
must be the same.

01:09:45.330 --> 01:09:49.880
So how can these two vectors be
the same and still satisfy

01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:53.250
these two inequalities?

01:09:53.250 --> 01:09:53.950
Good question.

01:09:53.950 --> 01:09:56.320
How can they be the same and
still satisfy this inequality?

01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:15.070
If t is less than d/2, then the
rate of this vector would

01:10:15.070 --> 01:10:18.000
have to be larger than
the rate of this.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.250
If they are non-zero.

01:10:22.530 --> 01:10:25.030
If they are non-zero, this would
have to be larger than

01:10:25.030 --> 01:10:30.250
this because then d minus t
would be greater than t.

01:10:30.250 --> 01:10:32.340
If this is true, this
implies this.

01:10:36.890 --> 01:10:40.980
If this is true, this implies
this which implies that the

01:10:40.980 --> 01:10:44.270
rate of this vector would be
larger than the rate of this

01:10:44.270 --> 01:10:45.670
vector if they are non-zero.

01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:50.890
But how can that be?

01:10:50.890 --> 01:10:53.210
Answer is cannot.

01:10:53.210 --> 01:10:56.080
Cannot be, hence,
they must be 0.

01:10:56.080 --> 01:11:00.150
Both vectors must be 0
completely, which means this

01:11:00.150 --> 01:11:02.250
is an error locator.

01:11:02.250 --> 01:11:08.180
Because otherwise, this wouldn't
be 0, and this one --

01:11:08.180 --> 01:11:09.430
where did I write it?

01:11:11.910 --> 01:11:13.160
Somewhere I wrote it.

01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:21.292
Where did I write it?

01:11:21.292 --> 01:11:22.750
Oh, here.

01:11:22.750 --> 01:11:27.300
So this S has to be 0 too.

01:11:27.300 --> 01:11:33.640
If this S is 0, then h of xi is
exactly this, means factors

01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:36.870
in the way you want it to.

01:11:36.870 --> 01:11:40.270
So that's all I can say.

01:11:40.270 --> 01:11:43.810
I could say it again, but it's
exactly the same words.

01:11:43.810 --> 01:11:47.324
And there's a limited benefit
to even the repetition code.

01:11:50.290 --> 01:11:51.880
So beautiful, right?

01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:54.750
We have brought down the entire
decoding problem for

01:11:54.750 --> 01:12:01.300
Reed-Solomon codes to solving a
linear system of equations,

01:12:01.300 --> 01:12:06.940
namely, this one here or this
one in short form, which,

01:12:06.940 --> 01:12:11.130
well, it's no problem at all in
the grand scheme of things.

01:12:11.130 --> 01:12:13.250
And that's the other thing that
makes Reed-Solomon codes

01:12:13.250 --> 01:12:14.080
so beautiful.

01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:17.674
They're access encoding, they're
access decoding,

01:12:17.674 --> 01:12:19.370
they're everything
that we want.

01:12:35.380 --> 01:12:38.660
Let me do one more thing about
the decoding just to bring it

01:12:38.660 --> 01:12:42.850
down a little bit, to talk a
little bit about complexity.

01:12:42.850 --> 01:12:50.560
Solving this linear system of
equations has been subject to

01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:56.850
research for 30 years,
40 years.

01:12:56.850 --> 01:13:01.520
So it started out with an
algorithm which essentially

01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:04.976
solved that linear
system directly.

01:13:04.976 --> 01:13:08.030
It was formulated a
bit different, but

01:13:08.030 --> 01:13:08.680
that's what it is.

01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:08.980
It's called the

01:13:08.980 --> 01:13:10.750
Peterson-Gorenstein-Zierler algorithm.

01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:20.850
They realized it was a
polynomial time decoding

01:13:20.850 --> 01:13:23.500
algorithm, a nice decoding
algorithm.

01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:24.060
Then Berlekamp --

01:13:24.060 --> 01:13:25.320
I should write down the name.

01:13:30.190 --> 01:13:31.760
Berlekamp came up with a fast

01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:33.420
algorithm and square algorithm.

01:13:40.030 --> 01:13:44.700
Massey had his own formulation
of that algorithm, which was a

01:13:44.700 --> 01:13:46.095
bit more streamlined I think.

01:13:48.810 --> 01:13:53.020
Then there was a later version,
Berlekamp-Welch.

01:13:58.230 --> 01:14:01.070
The complexity of these
algorithms is all roughly the

01:14:01.070 --> 01:14:03.920
same, is all n squared roughly,

01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:06.430
which solved this here.

01:14:06.430 --> 01:14:08.910
And then there's
roughly nothing

01:14:08.910 --> 01:14:10.280
happening for 30 years.

01:14:13.170 --> 01:14:21.630
And after 30 years, then Madhu
Sudan made the next serious

01:14:21.630 --> 01:14:25.820
dent in the decoding history
of Reed-Solomon codes.

01:14:25.820 --> 01:14:32.885
So he found a way to solve this
problem even beyond half

01:14:32.885 --> 01:14:35.700
the minimum distance.

01:14:35.700 --> 01:14:41.230
And in hindsight, it's a very
nice and very simple trick

01:14:41.230 --> 01:14:42.480
that he used.

01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:54.945
So we started with
the following.

01:14:54.945 --> 01:15:03.490
We started that, well, if we
have no errors, then the pairs

01:15:03.490 --> 01:15:13.110
of points xi, yi lie
on this curve.

01:15:13.110 --> 01:15:16.940
That's another way to formulate
what we said that yi

01:15:16.940 --> 01:15:20.760
minus f of xi has to be 0.

01:15:20.760 --> 01:15:23.480
We said, well, if there are no
errors, all the points that we

01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:26.260
receive lie on this curve.

01:15:26.260 --> 01:15:31.300
Because there are errors, we
have to multiply this with an

01:15:31.300 --> 01:15:39.570
error locator and say this
is 0 for all xi, yi.

01:15:39.570 --> 01:15:41.430
So this was problem
number one.

01:15:41.430 --> 01:15:57.280
The relaxed form was lambda
xy minus h of x 0 xi, yi.

01:15:57.280 --> 01:15:59.270
That's the way we do it.

01:15:59.270 --> 01:16:00.690
So what did Madhu do?

01:16:00.690 --> 01:16:01.330
Very clever.

01:16:01.330 --> 01:16:06.490
He said, all that we have to do
is annihilate the effect of

01:16:06.490 --> 01:16:09.380
the error right in this.

01:16:09.380 --> 01:16:12.070
The whole reason for that lambda
was to annihilate --

01:16:12.070 --> 01:16:16.270
so to take out the error
influence out of this

01:16:16.270 --> 01:16:20.800
interpolation formula, to allow
for a few errors to

01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:23.180
happen, which we can
put in lambda.

01:16:23.180 --> 01:16:27.520
Well, Madhu said, well, what
about we take a polynomial in

01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:28.770
two variables?

01:16:30.570 --> 01:16:36.790
A polynomial in two variables,
then same thing.

01:16:36.790 --> 01:16:43.030
If no errors happen, then all
the points xi, yi will lie on

01:16:43.030 --> 01:16:44.580
that curve.

01:16:44.580 --> 01:16:50.690
If a few errors happen, then
let's find a lambda xy, two

01:16:50.690 --> 01:16:55.790
variables of some minimal
degree, some very small degree

01:16:55.790 --> 01:16:57.715
so that this is still
satisfied.

01:17:02.082 --> 01:17:04.420
And the problem is entirely
the same.

01:17:07.820 --> 01:17:12.420
And this one, you cannot
solve either.

01:17:12.420 --> 01:17:14.160
You cannot solve either.

01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:19.950
But again, you can solve
the relaxation minus --

01:17:27.550 --> 01:17:29.280
again, you can solve
the relaxation.

01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:31.890
This is, again, a linear
system of equations.

01:17:31.890 --> 01:17:33.830
And the coefficients of
lambda and psi now.

01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:40.020
Once you solve this linear
system of equations --

01:17:40.020 --> 01:17:43.565
actually, this one you can more
handily write simply --

01:17:43.565 --> 01:17:46.270
now there is no way to
distinguish the y anymore

01:17:46.270 --> 01:17:50.090
since both sides anyway
depend on y.

01:17:50.090 --> 01:17:56.590
Find a polynomial in two
variables such that this is 0

01:17:56.590 --> 01:17:59.930
for all xi, yi.

01:17:59.930 --> 01:18:02.030
This is his central problem.

01:18:02.030 --> 01:18:03.160
This is his relaxation.

01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:05.350
Find a polynomial in two
variables, which he

01:18:05.350 --> 01:18:06.600
evaluates to 0.

01:18:09.140 --> 01:18:15.440
And then he has, essentially,
the same proofs we have here,

01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:20.360
a bit more technical,
but not much.

01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:22.710
I'm sure you can come up with
this if you sit down at home.

01:18:26.930 --> 01:18:27.610
Let's put it like this.

01:18:27.610 --> 01:18:29.180
There's no heavy machinery
in it.

01:18:29.180 --> 01:18:30.870
There's no heavy math in it.

01:18:30.870 --> 01:18:33.710
There's a lot of being clever
in it, but there's no heavy

01:18:33.710 --> 01:18:34.960
math in it.

01:18:40.690 --> 01:18:52.280
He can now guarantee that q of
xy, if t is less than n minus

01:18:52.280 --> 01:18:55.700
square root of 2k --

01:18:55.700 --> 01:18:57.570
is that right --

01:18:57.570 --> 01:19:06.280
2kn, then you can guarantee
that y minus fx is

01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:09.420
a factor q of xy.

01:19:09.420 --> 01:19:12.736
The same thing we wanted
to guarantee.

01:19:12.736 --> 01:19:19.170
And like I said, the proof is
very clever, but no heavy

01:19:19.170 --> 01:19:19.830
machinery in it.

01:19:19.830 --> 01:19:22.176
It's no heavy algebraic
geometry or any of

01:19:22.176 --> 01:19:23.426
this stuff in that.

01:19:25.940 --> 01:19:29.110
It's high school algebra.

01:19:29.110 --> 01:19:34.200
Well, freshman college
algebra.

01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:35.460
So that's what happens here.

01:19:39.056 --> 01:19:41.310
It took 30 years and a computer
scientist to solve

01:19:41.310 --> 01:19:42.560
that problem.

01:19:50.380 --> 01:19:55.110
That was not all I wanted
to say, but that's

01:19:55.110 --> 01:19:57.425
all I have time for.

01:19:57.425 --> 01:19:59.720
There's one minute left, so
there's no point in starting

01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:01.060
something now.

01:20:01.060 --> 01:20:02.603
Do you have any questions
about any of this?

01:20:08.882 --> 01:20:14.640
I should say that this 2 one can
get rid of, but that takes

01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:15.890
a little bit more machinery.

01:20:18.330 --> 01:20:20.785
The 2 one can get rid of, but
that's a bit more heavy.

01:20:24.544 --> 01:20:25.040
All right.

01:20:25.040 --> 01:20:27.530
So thanks so much.

01:20:27.530 --> 01:20:28.910
That's it.

01:20:28.910 --> 01:20:30.160
That's it.
