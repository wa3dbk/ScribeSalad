00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.560
PROFESSOR: So the idea behind
the encoder is increase the

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:23.760
minimum distance at the cost
of spectral efficiency.

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:38.070
The idea behind the decoder
was the following.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.710
You have a received signal, y.

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:49.930
And the job of the decoder is
to find x hat, which belongs

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.660
to the signal set so that
you minimize your

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:55.920
probability of error.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.840
And the probability of error
x is not equal to x-hat.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.780
That's the probability of
error for your decoder.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.090
And we saw a bunch of
equivalence rules -- we said

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.080
that the minimum probability of
error rule, which is this

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:18.900
rule here, is the same as the
maximum a posteriori rule.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.410
And this just follows
by the definition.

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:28.160
This was the same as the maximum
likelihood rule.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.350
And here we made one assumption
that all the

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.840
signals in your signal set
A are equally likely.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.660
And this was shown to be
equivalent to your minimum

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.130
distance decision rule.

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.580
And in order to show this
equivalence, we use the fact

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.630
that the noise was White
and Gaussian.

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.570
So this assumes equi-probable
signals.

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.265
And this assumes AWGN channel.

00:02:01.265 --> 00:02:02.515
OK.

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.840
In fact, the minimum distance
decisions has very nice

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.090
geometrical properties.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.190
We basically said that the
decision regions had a

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.250
particular shape.

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.100
They were convex polytopes.

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.720
And they were also known
as Voronoi regions.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.370
However, finding the exact
expression for the probability

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.850
of error seemed quite tedious
so we decided

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.640
to settle with bounds.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.200
And we developed some bounds for
the probability of error.

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.140
And the main bounds were -- we
had a strict upper bound,

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.937
which was the summation.

00:02:46.937 --> 00:02:48.187
OK.

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.230
This is a strict upper bound.

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.890
Well, the inequality here, say
it's a strict upper bound.

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.450
We also had a union
bound estimate.

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.910
Because this is a sum of various
Q functions, this is

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.270
still a very cumbersome
expression to evaluate.

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.440
So we wanted a simpler
expression.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:28.650
So we then approximated this
by K_min of aj times Q of

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.410
d_min over 2 sigma.

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.750
OK, and now if we take the
average on both sides, what we

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:43.650
get is the probability of error
is approximately equal

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.980
to K_min of the constellation,
which is the average number of

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:55.890
nearest neighbors, times Q
of d_min over 2 sigma.

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.600
And this expression is known as
the union bound estimate.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.120
We call it an estimate because
it's not a bound anymore.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.370
We have made an approximation
going from here to here.

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.910
So this is what we came
up with last time.

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.076
Throughout the analysis today,
whenever we have a probability

00:04:23.076 --> 00:04:25.970
of error expression, we will be
estimating it by the union

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.170
bound estimate.

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:31.310
So this union bound estimate
is quite important.

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.420
Are there any questions
on this?

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:40.700
OK, so today we will start by
introducing the notion of

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:41.950
effective coding gain.

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:03.330
And we'll use the symbol
gamma sub f for that.

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.790
What do we mean by effective
coding gain?

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:08.630
First you have to decide what
region you're operating in.

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:11.300
It's defined for both
bandwidth-limited regime and

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:12.800
power-limited regimes.

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.240
So let us start with the
power-limited regime.

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.600
Remember in the power-limited
regime, the trade-off we care

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:35.740
about is the probability of bit
error versus Eb over N_0.

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.110
The baseline scheme is 2-PAM.

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:49.630
And for 2-PAM, we showed two
lectures ago that the

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:56.650
probability of bit error is
given by Q of root 2 Eb N_0.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.310
OK, it should be --

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:10.870
so now the idea is to plot your
probability of bit error

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:12.120
as a function of Eb N_0.

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:19.760
Eb N_0 is always plotted
in dB on the x-axis.

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.790
The probability of bit
error we also plot on

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:25.750
a logarithmic scale.

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:27.590
So this is ten to
the minus six.

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:30.390
This is ten to the minus
five, ten to the

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:33.840
minus four and so on.

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:37.420
The Shannon limit is at --

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:39.412
this is the Shannon limit --

00:06:39.412 --> 00:06:45.830
is at minus 1.59 dB.

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:46.580
OK?

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:52.750
For the power-limited regime,
the performance of 2-PAM,

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:57.350
which is given by this
expression, is here.

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:01.260
And we basically go to say that
when the probability of

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:05.600
bit error is ten to the minus
five, the EbN _0 that you

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:11.310
require is 9.6 dB.

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:12.560
This is a nine.

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:19.540
So what's the idea behind the
effective coding gain?

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:23.440
Well, suppose I give you a
certain constellation, OK, a

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:24.940
certain signal set.

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:28.370
And you find the probability
of bit error for that,

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:29.070
and you plot it.

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:31.970
And it comes out to be
something like this.

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:37.470
So this is the performance for
some given signal set A. This

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:38.720
is your 2-PAM.

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:46.470
And now you want to quantify how
much better is the signal

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:49.390
set over the baseline system.

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:51.510
Now, so in other words you
want to look at the gap

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:53.490
between the two curves.

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:55.580
Now clearly the gap is going
to be a function of the

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:58.100
probability of bit
error, right?

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:01.990
But the basic idea now is you
want to fix a certain

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:04.530
probability of bit error because
if you're designing a

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:07.070
system, the probability of bit
error is something that the

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:08.920
system tolerates and is
going to be fixed

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:10.480
throughout the analysis.

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:12.320
So in this course, we'll
be fixing it at ten

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:13.920
to the minus five.

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:16.510
You fix this probability of bit
error to ten to the minus

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:18.610
five, and you look at how
much a gap you have

00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:21.520
between the two curves.

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:23.630
And this gap is going
to be your effective

00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:26.520
coding gain in dB.

00:08:33.049 --> 00:08:37.010
So in other words, effective
coding gain, I can write here,

00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:54.340
is the gap between a given
signal set and concordant

00:08:54.340 --> 00:09:01.415
system, 2-PAM, at a fixed
probability of bit error.

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:06.060
OK?

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:09.470
So now let us try to quantify
this effective coding gain

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:12.690
using the union bound estimate
that we have here.

00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:18.120
So if I have a certain signal
set, A, then I know from the

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:23.370
union bound estimate that the
probability of error is given

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:33.060
by K_min of A times
approximately Q of

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:37.160
d_min over 2 sigma.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.200
So since I want that expression
in terms of

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:43.360
probability of bit error,
I will use the fact that

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:46.620
probability of bit error is
probability of error per

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:51.130
symbols or the number
of bits per symobl.

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:55.730
Since I have endpoints in my
signal set, I have logM bits

00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:56.980
per symbol.

00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:15.980
And this is then K_min of A over
logM base 2 times Q of

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:17.780
d_min over 2 sigma.

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:37.100
So I'm going to rewrite my
probability of bit error

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:40.620
expression now in this --

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:44.080
in fact the right side
in this quad.

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:56.390
K_b of A times Q of root
2 gamma_c of A

00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:58.870
times Eb over N_0.

00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:00.520
So I'm just going to define
the right hand

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:01.880
side in this way.

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:05.290
And I'm going to relate gamma_c
of A and K_b of A to

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:08.620
the parameters I have on the
right hand side there.

00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:10.690
And why do I want to
do it this way?

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:13.620
Because I want to get an
expression as close as

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:17.330
possible to the performance
of an uncoded 2-PAM system

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:20.900
because that way things will be
easier to do if I want to

00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:24.530
calculate the effective
coding gain, OK?

00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:27.240
So how do the parameters
relate?

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:40.810
Well, K_b of A is K_min of A
over logM to the base 2.

00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:56.430
And this is the average number
of nearest neighbors per

00:11:56.430 --> 00:12:04.110
information bit.

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:08.060
If I compare the arguments
inside the Q function, what I

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:20.570
have is 2 gamma_c of A times Eb
N_0 is the argument d_min

00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:25.350
over 2 sigma squared, which I
will write as d_min squared

00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:28.960
over 4 sigma squared.

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:32.950
So remember sigma squared
is N_0 over 2.

00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:36.397
So if I simplify this
expression, what I will end up

00:12:36.397 --> 00:12:45.525
getting is gamma_c of A is
d_min squared over 4 Eb.

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:51.500
Gamma_c of A is known as the
nominal coding gain.

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:06.060
It's not the same as the
effective coding gain, which

00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:08.880
is the distance between
the two curves.

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:13.730
OK, are there any questions
so far?

00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:18.440
So far what I have done is given
a constellation A, I can

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:20.870
find two parameters.

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:25.490
I can find the nominal coding
gain, and I can find the

00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:30.000
average number of nearest
neighbors per information bit.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.630
And using these two parameters,
we will try to get

00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:35.360
a handle over the effective
coding gain.

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:36.990
So that's the idea.

00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:38.490
So how can we plot --

00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:41.420
so given this constellation
A, we want to plot the

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:44.050
probability of bit error
curve like this.

00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:46.430
But instead of plotting the
exact curve we will be

00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:49.600
plotting this curve here,
which is the union bound

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:52.270
estimate of your probability
of bit error.

00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:57.290
So we will always be plotting
the union bound estimate.

00:13:57.290 --> 00:13:59.200
So how do we do that?

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:02.270
So we'll again start with
a curve like that.

00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:07.930
Probability of bit error as
a function of Eb N_0.

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:11.020
This is in dB.

00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:13.980
The y-axis is also in dB.

00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:15.870
Sorry, not in dB but
on the log scale.

00:14:22.995 --> 00:14:24.760
And so on.

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:28.870
This is the Shannon
limit at minus 1.

00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:30.120
59 dB.

00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:36.000
This is the 2-PAM performance.

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:43.770
So if we want to plot this union
bound estimate, you will

00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:45.250
be doing two steps.

00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:48.170
First, we'll be plotting this
Q function, a curve

00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:49.780
corresponding to
the Q function.

00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:52.110
And then we'll be scaling it.

00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:56.400
So if I just want to plot this
Q function, how will it

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:58.070
compare to this curve here?

00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:08.660
Well, you're just scaling the
argument inside the Q

00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:10.130
function, right?

00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:13.280
But now because we are plotting
the x-axis on a dB

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:17.770
scale, it simply means that we
are translating to the left by

00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:20.670
an amount of gamma_c in dB.

00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:22.920
Is that clear?

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:23.850
Well, let's see.

00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:28.500
What we are doing is we are
going to scale the x-axis by a

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:29.790
certain constant.

00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:33.210
So this means that we will have
to scale x-axis here.

00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:37.480
But, our Eb N_0 is being plotted
on a dB scale, right?

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:41.610
So multiplying in the linear
scale corresponds to an

00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:43.680
addition on the logarithmic
scale.

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:47.240
An addition on the logarithmic
scale simply implies a shift

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:52.170
on the x-axis so that's the
constant shift on the x-axis.

00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:53.800
I'm going to plot it here.

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:58.020
This curve is going to be
parallel to the original 2-PAM

00:15:58.020 --> 00:16:01.310
curve to the best
of my abilities.

00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:05.010
OK, so this is what we get
as your Q function.

00:16:05.010 --> 00:16:08.800
Now we are going to scale the
y-axis by this factor here,

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:14.300
K_b of A. But remember the
y-axis is also on a

00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:16.970
logarithmic scale, rather
than the linear scale.

00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:21.010
So multiply [INAUDIBLE] by a
factor of K_b of A implies a

00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:24.590
vertical shift by a
certain factor.

00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:27.760
So I'm going to do a vertical
shift here.

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:38.510
So let me make that
darker now.

00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:40.060
So this is what I
end up getting.

00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:46.250
OK, now note that the distance
between these two curves is

00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:47.960
not fixed anymore.

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:51.460
If the slope is steeper, then
this distance is small,

00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:53.790
meaning that this distance
here is large.

00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:57.830
On the other hand, if the slope
is going to be smaller

00:16:57.830 --> 00:17:01.330
here, then this distance
is large.

00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:03.770
So this means that a distance
between these two curves is no

00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:05.099
longer fixed.

00:17:05.099 --> 00:17:07.859
And basically what we're saying
here is that if the

00:17:07.859 --> 00:17:11.109
probability of error is large,
then the number of nearest

00:17:11.109 --> 00:17:13.069
neighbors matters much more.

00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:15.280
But if the probability of error
is going to be quite

00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:19.400
small, then the more important
factor is your exponent, how

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:21.750
fast the slope decays as opposed
to the number of

00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:26.349
nearest neighbors, OK?

00:17:26.349 --> 00:17:31.630
This distance here is your
effective coding gain.

00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:37.420
And this constant horizontal
distance here is your nominal

00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:39.364
coding gain in dB.

00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:49.280
Are there any questions
on this curve?

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:51.842
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:51.842 --> 00:17:57.800
on the right of four 2-PAM
because these are the logM.

00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:01.340
PROFESSOR: So so what I'm
really assuming is that

00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:03.350
gamma_c of A is greater
than 1.

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:05.250
So if I'm adding it, then
I'm going to shift

00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:06.500
to the left, right?

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:21.035
OK, so a couple of remarks.

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:34.970
I'm just summarizing a few
remarks I made while

00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:36.430
plotting the curve.

00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:53.430
First is the log-log scale is
very convenient because any

00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:56.280
multiplicative factor simply
involves a translation along

00:18:56.280 --> 00:19:00.040
the x and y directions.

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:07.510
The second point is that the
accuracy we have in the

00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:21.330
effective coding gain in this
way is determined by the union

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:26.020
bound estimate because that's
all we are plotting.

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:28.160
We are not really plotting
the exact curve.

00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:35.380
And the third point is that
we have a rule of thumb.

00:19:41.770 --> 00:19:45.190
Because the distance between the
curves is not fixed, it's

00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:47.720
still too tedious to find the
exact numerical value of

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:49.610
effective coding gain.

00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:52.750
So what we can find is the value
of the nominal coding

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:57.390
gain and K_b of A exactly,
given a constellation.

00:19:57.390 --> 00:20:00.320
So we want to have a rule
of thumb for the

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:02.200
effective coding gain.

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:06.280
And the rule of thumb is that
the effective coding gain is

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:16.050
given by the nominal coding gain
in dB minus 0.2 log2 of

00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:20.620
K_b of A. This is in dB.

00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:25.450
What this means is every factor
of two increase is K_b

00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:29.590
results in a loss of 0.2 dB in
the effective coding gain.

00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:35.520
OK, and this is our probability
of bit error of

00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:37.600
ten to the minus five.

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:42.060
So that's the region that we
will be doing our analysis in.

00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:44.610
So this rule of thumb
is quite helpful.

00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:46.594
Are there any questions?

00:20:46.594 --> 00:20:49.340
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:50.530
PROFESSOR: This rule of thumb?

00:20:50.530 --> 00:20:53.360
Well, it works quite well
in practice so you

00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:54.860
want to use that rule.

00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:57.360
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:58.610
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:09.150
If things are clear, let
us do some examples.

00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:19.515
So let us start with a
2-PAM for examples.

00:21:24.810 --> 00:21:26.480
The first is 2-PAM system.

00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:32.950
What's the effective coding
gain going to be for this

00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:35.790
constellation?

00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:38.250
It's going to be 0 dB, right?

00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:39.500
It just follows from
the definition.

00:21:42.718 --> 00:21:46.790
I mean the effective coding gain
tells us how much gap we

00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:50.000
have between this new
constellation and 2-PAM.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.990
If your new constellation is
2-PAM itself, we don't have

00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:56.100
any effective coding gain.

00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:57.350
What about the 4-QAM?

00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:04.230
It's going to be still 0,
because a 4-QAM is a Cartesian

00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:06.820
product of two 2-PAM
constellations.

00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:09.290
And we argued last time that
there is no coding gain if you

00:22:09.290 --> 00:22:11.970
use a Cartesian product.

00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:16.290
If you want to verify it using
the framework that we have

00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:21.420
just developed, say we
have four points.

00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:24.070
This point is alpha, alpha.

00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:30.580
This point is minus alpha,
alpha, minus alpha, minus

00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:33.600
alpha, and alpha minus alpha.

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:39.010
The nominal coding gain
is given by d_min

00:22:39.010 --> 00:22:40.580
squared over 4 Eb.

00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:49.820
The minimum distance is 3 alpha
between any two points.

00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:52.250
So we have 4 alpha squared.

00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:54.040
Then what's the energy
per bit?

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:57.210
Well, the energy per symbol
is 2 alpha squared.

00:22:57.210 --> 00:23:00.240
Then we have two bits per
symbol, so the energy per bit

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:01.520
is alpha squared.

00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:05.080
So we have 4 alpha squared,
and so that's 1.

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:08.060
So we do not have any
nominal coding gain.

00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:10.600
K_b of A, what's that
going to be?

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:13.870
Well, we have two nearest
neighbors per symbol, but we

00:23:13.870 --> 00:23:15.830
also have two bits per symbol.

00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:17.910
So the number of nearest
neighbors per bit

00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:18.940
is going to be one.

00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:23.960
So your nominal coding gain is
1, K_b of A is going to be 1.

00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:28.220
And so we do not see
any coding gain

00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:30.880
for the 4-QAM system.

00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:33.660
Now let me do a slightly
different case.

00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:37.770
Let me start with a 4-QAM,
but I remove two points.

00:23:37.770 --> 00:23:40.860
I remove this point, and
I remove this point.

00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:43.610
And I only keep the
two points here.

00:23:43.610 --> 00:23:48.710
So I have a constellation, say,
A prime, which only has

00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:52.490
two points, one point here
and one point here.

00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:55.750
So this point is alpha, alpha,
and this point is minus alpha,

00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:58.180
minus alpha.

00:23:58.180 --> 00:24:00.480
Any idea what the effective
coding gain

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:01.730
will be for this case?

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.920
AUDIENCE: I think
it's the same.

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:08.900
PROFESSOR: It's still
zero, right?

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:12.130
AUDIENCE: Yeah, because it's
saying that's 2-PAM.

00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:12.820
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:17.600
All this is a 2-PAM
constellation embedded in two

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:18.910
dimensions.

00:24:18.910 --> 00:24:22.130
It's 2-PAM along this
line, right?

00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:24.780
So I cannot hope to have a
higher coding gain for this

00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:27.620
constellation over
the original one.

00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:30.340
I mean I told you the story that
we can take a subset of

00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:33.860
points, and we can increase
the minimum distance by

00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:35.360
throwing away some points.

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:38.700
But one has to be careful
in that analysis.

00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:41.280
There could be examples where
you're strictly improving the

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:42.760
minimum distance.

00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:49.460
Note that the minimum distance
here is going to 8 alpha

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:52.230
squared now.

00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:54.970
OK, so the minimum distance
is strictly improved.

00:24:54.970 --> 00:24:58.530
But what happens to be
your energy per bit?

00:24:58.530 --> 00:25:01.780
Well, the energy per symbol
is 2 alpha squared.

00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:05.650
But you only have one bit per
symbol, so the energy per bit

00:25:05.650 --> 00:25:07.760
is 2 alpha squared.

00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:13.710
So your nominal coding gain is
d_min squared over 4 Eb, which

00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:17.130
follows from the relation
we have here.

00:25:17.130 --> 00:25:19.310
And d_min squared is
8 alpha squared.

00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:23.040
4 Eb is also 8 alpha squared, so
the nominal coding gain is

00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:24.410
1, or 0 dB.

00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:30.810
The average number of nearest
neighbors, well, we only have

00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:34.120
one nearest neighbor, and we
have one bit per symbol, so

00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:37.950
that's -- and this is A
prime by the way --

00:25:37.950 --> 00:25:39.270
is going to be 1.

00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:42.627
And so the effective coding
gain is still 0 dB.

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:48.170
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:54.170
PROFESSOR: So probability of
symbol error as a function of

00:25:54.170 --> 00:25:56.250
alpha has definitely
decreased, right.

00:25:56.250 --> 00:25:58.530
But the trade-off we care about
is probability of bit

00:25:58.530 --> 00:26:00.740
error as a function of Eb N_0.

00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:02.620
In other words, this curve
is still here.

00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:04.370
It's not changed.

00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:07.450
I just shifted right by
reducing my spectral

00:26:07.450 --> 00:26:07.622
efficiency.

00:26:07.622 --> 00:26:08.872
OK?

00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:19.810
So let's do one last example
just to prove that it's not

00:26:19.810 --> 00:26:23.290
always the case that you get
nothing by removing points.

00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:42.770
OK, so the contellation that
I have in mind is the one I

00:27:42.770 --> 00:27:45.420
introduced last time.

00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:50.170
We'll start with a 3, 4
Cartesian product of 2-PAM.

00:27:50.170 --> 00:27:54.980
OK, so in three dimensions
it's a cube, and the 3,4

00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:57.840
Cartesian product will
have a point on each

00:27:57.840 --> 00:27:59.260
vertex of the cube.

00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:01.150
And we only keep four points.

00:28:01.150 --> 00:28:03.377
So the points we keep are
these four points.

00:28:03.377 --> 00:28:04.627
OK?

00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:19.300
So I write B, the coordinates
are alpha, alpha, alpha, minus

00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:24.540
alpha, minus alpha, alpha,
minus alpha, alpha, minus

00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:31.770
alpha, and alpha, minus
alpha, minus alpha.

00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:33.650
So these are the vertices.

00:28:33.650 --> 00:28:37.575
These are the coordinates of the
four points here where we

00:28:37.575 --> 00:28:40.190
have the standard x, y and
z-axis, which I'm not drawing

00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:42.360
because it will just
look confusing.

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:46.320
So now we'll see that for this
particular signal set, we do

00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:49.170
have a coding gain, OK?

00:28:49.170 --> 00:28:50.595
Let's find the minimum
distance.

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:56.740
The minimum distance
here is what?

00:28:56.740 --> 00:29:00.010
It's the distance along
a diagonal.

00:29:00.010 --> 00:29:04.390
And the diagonal is of length to
-- each side of the cube is

00:29:04.390 --> 00:29:05.640
off-length to alpha.

00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:13.930
So the diagonal is of
length to alpha.

00:29:13.930 --> 00:29:16.275
So d_min squared is
8 alpha squared.

00:29:19.450 --> 00:29:21.950
What is the energy per bit
going to be in this case?

00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:35.226
Well, what's the energy
per symbol now?

00:29:35.226 --> 00:29:37.520
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:40.140
PROFESSOR: 3 alpha squared
over 2 is the Eb, right?

00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:43.890
We have 3 alpha squared units
of energy per symbol.

00:29:43.890 --> 00:29:48.230
We have four points, so we
have two bits per symbol.

00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:54.900
So the energy per bit is
3 alpha squared over 2.

00:29:54.900 --> 00:30:01.470
So now if I look at my nominal
coding gain, that's going to

00:30:01.470 --> 00:30:07.210
be d_min squared over 4 Eb.

00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:10.640
d_min squared is 8
alpha squared.

00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:14.170
4 dB is 6 alpha squared.

00:30:14.170 --> 00:30:17.080
So that's 4/3.

00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:21.780
On a linear scale and on a dB
scale, this is going to be?

00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:34.666
You guys should remember
your dB tables.

00:30:37.534 --> 00:30:39.446
AUDIENCE: 0.2?

00:30:39.446 --> 00:30:40.410
PROFESSOR: 12.

00:30:40.410 --> 00:30:42.510
You have to multiply by ten.

00:30:42.510 --> 00:30:46.150
So actually I think it's 1.3,
more like 1.3 dB if you look

00:30:46.150 --> 00:30:47.880
at the last significant digit.

00:30:50.730 --> 00:30:56.760
OK, so what's K_b of A going
to be in this case?

00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:59.055
Or K_b of B I should say.

00:30:59.055 --> 00:31:01.650
I'm calling the signal
set B here.

00:31:01.650 --> 00:31:06.140
So what is K_b if
B going to be?

00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:15.260
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:17.180
PROFESSOR: 3 by 2, right?

00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:19.760
You have three nearest neighbors
per point, for each

00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:21.150
point has three nearest
neighbors.

00:31:21.150 --> 00:31:22.840
They're all equidistant.

00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:23.906
And you have two bits
per symbol.

00:31:23.906 --> 00:31:25.156
OK?

00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:29.650
So if you work out your
effective coding again using

00:31:29.650 --> 00:31:33.745
this rule of thumb here, take
gamma_c of A in dB and

00:31:33.745 --> 00:31:37.460
subtract 0.2 log2 you will see
that the effective coding gain

00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:39.220
is approximately 1 dB.

00:31:55.730 --> 00:31:56.980
Are there any questions?

00:32:00.970 --> 00:32:02.800
OK, so it might seem that
this is still not a

00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:03.760
very impressive number.

00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:05.100
Yes, you had a question.

00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:07.810
AUDIENCE: What was it about this
constellation that gave

00:32:07.810 --> 00:32:09.082
us coding gain?

00:32:09.082 --> 00:32:12.390
Was is the face that we went
to higher dimensions?

00:32:12.390 --> 00:32:15.240
PROFESSOR: Right, so usually
you do get a coding gain if

00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:20.400
you trade-off minimum distance
with spectral efficiency.

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:22.820
So that's usually the case.

00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:26.200
So that's why I presented you
an example of that case.

00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:28.180
It's just that this was a very
special case where you end up

00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:30.766
with a 2-PAM constellation
to start with.

00:32:36.010 --> 00:32:42.440
OK, so the comment I was going
to make is that 1.2 dB still

00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:44.510
might not be like a very
impressive number.

00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:47.230
I mean after all the hard
work, you just get 1 dB

00:32:47.230 --> 00:32:48.660
effective coding gain.

00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:51.290
So the question to ask at this
point is are there any

00:32:51.290 --> 00:32:54.980
constellations that have much
higher coding gains?

00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:58.440
In particular, other
constellations that come close

00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:01.340
to the Shannon limit at all.

00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:04.280
And we'll look at one
interesting class of signal

00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:06.640
sets, which are known as
orthogonal signal sets.

00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:22.140
And you probably saw these
examples back in 6.450, but

00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:24.070
we're just reviewing
it again here.

00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:27.620
And these signal sets have a
property that as you increase

00:33:27.620 --> 00:33:30.960
the number of dimensions, you
come arbitrarily close to the

00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:32.770
Shannon limit.

00:33:32.770 --> 00:33:37.110
So the definition of the signal
sets is your A --

00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:43.450
it's a collection of signals aj,
where j goes from 1 to M

00:33:43.450 --> 00:33:52.450
such that the inner product
between ai and aj is E A times

00:33:52.450 --> 00:33:56.030
delta_i,j, meaning that if i
is not equal to j, the two

00:33:56.030 --> 00:33:56.920
signals are orthogonal.

00:33:56.920 --> 00:34:01.560
And if i equals j, the
energy is E(A).

00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:05.420
Geometrically, we
have two points.

00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:07.220
The two points can be
thought of as two

00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:09.870
points on the two axes.

00:34:09.870 --> 00:34:12.650
So this is a case
when M equals 2.

00:34:12.650 --> 00:34:16.139
When M equals 3, the three
points will lie on those three

00:34:16.139 --> 00:34:17.389
corresponding axes.

00:34:19.650 --> 00:34:22.870
So this is the case when
M equals 3 and so on.

00:34:22.870 --> 00:34:25.120
So generally when you have
M points, your signal

00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:28.020
spatializes in M dimensions, and
each point can be thought

00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:31.860
of as a point on one
of the axes.

00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:36.760
So if you look at the distance
between any two points, it's

00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:41.850
the norm of ai minus
aj squared.

00:34:41.850 --> 00:34:46.210
I could simplify this simply as
the norm of ai squared plus

00:34:46.210 --> 00:34:50.050
the norm of aj squared because
the end product

00:34:50.050 --> 00:34:52.630
is going to be zero.

00:34:52.630 --> 00:34:55.760
OK, now ai squared is
going to be E(A).

00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:57.810
aj squared is going
to be E(A).

00:34:57.810 --> 00:35:01.280
So this is 2E(A).

00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:03.440
So what we're saying here
is that every point is

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:06.880
equidistant from every other
point, and the square of the

00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:09.940
distance is 2 E(A).

00:35:09.940 --> 00:35:11.190
OK?

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:18.230
So in other words, the average
number of nearest neighbors is

00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:20.160
always going to be
a M minus 1.

00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:27.700
So let us calculate the nominal
coding gain for this

00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:28.950
constellation.

00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:38.460
That's going to be d_min
squared over 4 Eb.

00:35:41.590 --> 00:35:49.160
d_min squared is 2E(A)
over 4 Eb.

00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:53.090
Well, the energy per bit is the
energy per symbol, which

00:35:53.090 --> 00:35:56.585
is E(A) over the number of bits
per symbol, which is log

00:35:56.585 --> 00:35:59.710
M to the base 2.

00:35:59.710 --> 00:36:09.520
And this I'm going to write
here is 1/2 log

00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:11.890
M to the base 2.

00:36:11.890 --> 00:36:15.622
So as I increase my M, my
number of dimensions, my

00:36:15.622 --> 00:36:17.155
nominal coding gain
goes to infinity.

00:36:17.155 --> 00:36:18.405
OK?

00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:23.310
What do we expect for the
effective coding gain?

00:36:23.310 --> 00:36:24.560
Will it also go to infinity?

00:36:30.974 --> 00:36:32.408
AUDIENCE: It approaches
the Shannon limit.

00:36:32.408 --> 00:36:34.300
PROFESSOR: Well, we don't know
whether it approaches the

00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:36.115
Shannon limit as of yet,
but we know it

00:36:36.115 --> 00:36:37.250
cannot go to infinity.

00:36:37.250 --> 00:36:38.546
It's upper bounded by
the Shannon limit.

00:36:38.546 --> 00:36:40.220
Right?

00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:44.090
So the effective coding gain
cannot really become

00:36:44.090 --> 00:36:48.220
unbounded, and what's really
happening here?

00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:49.470
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:51.890 --> 00:36:54.280
PROFESSOR: Right, but why does
the effective coding gain stay

00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:56.610
bounded and the nominal
coding gain blow up?

00:36:56.610 --> 00:36:58.680
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:01.010
PROFESSOR: Right, the number
of nearest neighbors also

00:37:01.010 --> 00:37:02.440
increases with M, right?

00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:04.359
Not just the nominal
coding gain.

00:38:32.330 --> 00:38:34.570
So let's write that down.

00:38:34.570 --> 00:38:37.460
If I look at the number of
nearest neighbors per

00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:40.690
information bit --

00:38:40.690 --> 00:38:41.510
yes?

00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:44.480
AUDIENCE: These don't
have 0 mean, right?

00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:45.790
PROFESSOR: Right, they
don't have 0 mean.

00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:47.040
That's a good point.

00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:56.170
PROFESSOR: Let's see, what
happens to the mean as M goes

00:38:56.170 --> 00:38:57.420
to infinity?

00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:02.470
If we look at what happens to
the mean, it will be 1 over M.

00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:05.410
You find the mean of this guy,
it's 1 over 2 times the

00:39:05.410 --> 00:39:09.300
distance here times distance
here is 1 over 2 E(A), E(A).

00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:10.260
OK?

00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:12.340
If you look at three dimensions,
it's 1 over 3

00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:14.050
E(A), E(A), E(A).

00:39:14.050 --> 00:39:16.560
So in M dimensions, it's going
to be 1 over M times all these

00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:17.180
coordinates.

00:39:17.180 --> 00:39:19.930
If we look at the mean squared,
it goes to 0 as M

00:39:19.930 --> 00:39:21.042
goes to infinity.

00:39:21.042 --> 00:39:24.390
So that's a good point.

00:39:24.390 --> 00:39:26.276
So the mean does go
to 0, and so we

00:39:26.276 --> 00:39:27.910
approach the Shannon limit.

00:39:30.410 --> 00:39:38.260
So we have K_b of A over
logM What's the

00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:39.610
number of nearest neighbors?

00:39:39.610 --> 00:39:47.990
We saw it was M minus 1 over
log M. And that goes to

00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:51.990
infinity as M goes
to infinity.

00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:55.980
OK, so the average number
of nearest neighbors per

00:39:55.980 --> 00:40:00.590
information bit also
go to infinity

00:40:00.590 --> 00:40:02.930
as M goes to infinity.

00:40:02.930 --> 00:40:07.060
And if we look at the mean --
just to write down the comment

00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:09.100
that was made.

00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:13.120
If we look at the mean of this
constellation, that's going to

00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:21.960
be 1 over the number of points
times root E(A) root

00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:26.590
E(A) and root E(A).

00:40:26.590 --> 00:40:28.170
So there are M coordinates.

00:40:28.170 --> 00:40:30.760
So that's going to be the mean
if you believe this is the

00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:33.300
coordinate axis here.

00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:39.550
And if you we look at the norm
of M(A) squared, then it's

00:40:39.550 --> 00:40:46.310
going to be E(A) over M. And
as M goes to infinity,

00:40:46.310 --> 00:40:47.560
this goes to 0.

00:40:54.508 --> 00:40:57.590
And because the mean goes to
0, it's not unreasonable to

00:40:57.590 --> 00:41:00.825
expect that the performance does
approach to the ultimate

00:41:00.825 --> 00:41:03.200
Shanon limit.

00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:09.060
OK, so so far we have looked at
K_b of A and gamma_c of A.

00:41:09.060 --> 00:41:10.620
If you look at the
effective coding

00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:13.640
gain, it is still bounded.

00:41:16.930 --> 00:41:18.360
It's always bounded.

00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:22.280
It is not clear at this point
what really happens to it.

00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:25.750
And in fact, it's not quite
straightforward to actually

00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:28.440
show what happens to the
effective coding gain.

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:32.260
If you have taken 6.450, then
Professor Bob Gallager really

00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:35.470
goes into the details of proving
how the effective

00:41:35.470 --> 00:41:38.490
coding gain for this signal set
indeed does approach the

00:41:38.490 --> 00:41:40.560
Shannon limit.

00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:50.690
But it can be shown that the
effective coding gain does

00:41:50.690 --> 00:41:56.790
approach 11.2 dB as M
goes to infinity.

00:41:56.790 --> 00:41:59.560
The main trick here is that
union bound is usually quite

00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:01.770
weak if the probability
of error is small.

00:42:01.770 --> 00:42:04.450
So we replace the probability of
error just by 1, instead of

00:42:04.450 --> 00:42:06.240
the union bound,
at some point.

00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:10.300
And if you do that change, then
things work out nicely.

00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:13.520
But in this course, we will
just assert that the

00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:16.040
orthogonal signal sets
do achieve the

00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:17.580
ultimate Shannon limit.

00:42:17.580 --> 00:42:22.180
And you can see 6.450
notes for the proof.

00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:33.570
So that's the assertion that
we are making right now.

00:42:33.570 --> 00:42:36.910
So let's step back and
take a look at what's

00:42:36.910 --> 00:42:38.740
happening so far.

00:42:38.740 --> 00:42:41.990
We have a class of signal sets
which are conceptually quite

00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:43.290
easy to describe.

00:42:43.290 --> 00:42:45.430
They are just orthogonal
signal sets.

00:42:45.430 --> 00:42:47.870
They are not too hard
to analyze, and they

00:42:47.870 --> 00:42:51.460
asymptotically approach the
ultimate Shannon limit.

00:42:51.460 --> 00:42:52.730
So this seems quite nice.

00:42:52.730 --> 00:42:56.010
So why not we just
implement them?

00:42:56.010 --> 00:42:59.180
Now it turns that these are not
very common in practice.

00:42:59.180 --> 00:43:01.850
They are not implemented as
often as you might think when

00:43:01.850 --> 00:43:03.740
you first look at
them and because

00:43:03.740 --> 00:43:05.840
they have some drawbacks.

00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:09.610
And there are a couple of
drawbacks which make them very

00:43:09.610 --> 00:43:12.530
less appealing than what you
might otherwise think.

00:43:15.450 --> 00:43:18.820
And first of all, what's the
spectral efficiency for these

00:43:18.820 --> 00:43:20.070
signal sets?

00:43:23.316 --> 00:43:24.230
AUDIENCE:0, right?

00:43:24.230 --> 00:43:25.150
PROFESSOR: It goes to 0.

00:43:25.150 --> 00:43:27.050
And how does it go to 0?

00:43:27.050 --> 00:43:33.370
It's 2log M to the base 2 over
M. As M goes to infinity,

00:43:33.370 --> 00:43:34.960
this goes to 0.

00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:39.150
And in fact, it goes
to 0 quite sharply.

00:43:39.150 --> 00:43:41.740
Now that's fine, but if you
want to approach Shannon

00:43:41.740 --> 00:43:45.300
limit, our spectral efficiency
should indeed go to 0.

00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:48.520
But if you're looking at the
system design problem, what do

00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:50.050
you really want?

00:43:50.050 --> 00:43:52.330
You have a certain effective
coding gain that you have in

00:43:52.330 --> 00:43:55.030
mind, and suppose you are
presented with a list of

00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:57.960
several different signal sets
that achieve this effective

00:43:57.960 --> 00:43:59.290
coding gain.

00:43:59.290 --> 00:44:02.700
And your job is to pick one of
these possible signal sets.

00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:04.320
Which one will you pick?

00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:06.430
Well, there are two things
you will look for, right?

00:44:06.430 --> 00:44:08.220
You will look for the spectral
efficiency that these

00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:12.020
different signal sets require
or achieve in order to get

00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:13.800
this effective coding gain.

00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:16.650
And the higher the spectral
efficiency the better.

00:44:16.650 --> 00:44:18.660
And secondly, you will also
want to look at the

00:44:18.660 --> 00:44:20.600
implementation complexity.

00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:22.760
You do not want something which
really takes a lot of

00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:25.110
time to decode.

00:44:25.110 --> 00:44:25.195
OK?

00:44:25.195 --> 00:44:27.770
So it turns out that because the
spectral efficiency goes

00:44:27.770 --> 00:44:31.180
to 0 so sharply, it's not very
surprising that there are

00:44:31.180 --> 00:44:34.380
other codes that have the same
effective coding gain but

00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:36.480
higher spectral efficiency.

00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:55.460
So there are binary codes that
have a higher spectral

00:44:55.460 --> 00:45:03.050
efficiency for same effective
coding gain.

00:45:03.050 --> 00:45:05.860
And so they would be a natural
choice over the orthogonal

00:45:05.860 --> 00:45:06.960
signal set.

00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:08.130
Yes?

00:45:08.130 --> 00:45:09.740
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
high-spectrum efficiency to

00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:11.350
mean bandwidth?

00:45:11.350 --> 00:45:12.990
PROFESSOR: Right, because in
practice, bandwidth is never

00:45:12.990 --> 00:45:14.320
really infinite, right?

00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:16.850
So if you are achieving
the same --

00:45:16.850 --> 00:45:18.440
the first objective is
to have a certain

00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:19.530
effective coding gain.

00:45:19.530 --> 00:45:21.680
If you do have that, you want to
pick something which has a

00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:24.090
higher spectral efficiency.

00:45:24.090 --> 00:45:28.120
And indeed, the subject of
chapters six and eight is to

00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:30.850
come up with binary codes that
have a much better performance

00:45:30.850 --> 00:45:32.970
than the orthogonal signal
set for a given

00:45:32.970 --> 00:45:34.430
effective coding gain.

00:45:34.430 --> 00:45:37.240
Chapter six deals with the the
block codes, whereas chapter

00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:39.880
eight deals with convolutional
codes.

00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:43.220
And chapter seven basically
develops all the finite field

00:45:43.220 --> 00:45:46.410
theory that you require to study
convolutional codes.

00:45:46.410 --> 00:45:49.430
So the point is, in the
subsequent lectures we will be

00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:52.510
focusing a lot on improving
the performance over

00:45:52.510 --> 00:45:54.940
orthogonal signal sets.

00:45:54.940 --> 00:45:57.775
The second point I mentioned was
implementation complexity.

00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:10.670
Now one particular way of
implementing orthogonal codes,

00:46:10.670 --> 00:46:15.100
which you saw in the first
homework, was using this idea

00:46:15.100 --> 00:46:17.100
of Hadamard transforms, right?

00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:19.940
You have a Hardamard matrix,
which is an M by M matrix.

00:46:19.940 --> 00:46:22.260
The rows of the Hadamard matrix
are your orthogonal

00:46:22.260 --> 00:46:25.400
signal sets, which
are elements aj.

00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:27.950
And at the receiver, what you
would do is when you get the

00:46:27.950 --> 00:46:31.730
signal y, you simply multiply
by the Hadamard matrix and

00:46:31.730 --> 00:46:34.050
look at the coordinate
which is the largest.

00:46:34.050 --> 00:46:35.180
So this is something
you did in the

00:46:35.180 --> 00:46:37.120
first homework exercise.

00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:40.680
And how many computations did
you require for an orthogonal

00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:41.960
signal set of size M?

00:46:46.010 --> 00:46:47.260
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:51.420 --> 00:46:51.506
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

00:46:51.506 --> 00:46:54.350
OK, so I meant M being
the size of the

00:46:54.350 --> 00:46:55.792
orthogonal signal set.

00:46:55.792 --> 00:46:59.030
AUDIENCE: Yeah, [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:59.030 --> 00:47:01.778
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:47:01.778 --> 00:47:03.590
AUDIENCE: 2 to the
M by 2 to the M.

00:47:03.590 --> 00:47:05.330
PROFESSOR: If it is 2 to the M
by 2 to the M, it is M times 2

00:47:05.330 --> 00:47:09.470
to the M. But there are M
orthogonal signal sets, then

00:47:09.470 --> 00:47:17.950
it will be M log M, where M is
the number of signal sets.

00:47:17.950 --> 00:47:19.440
So that's the number
of computations

00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:20.970
that you would require.

00:47:20.970 --> 00:47:26.640
Now, the question to ask is, is
this fast or is this slow?

00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:28.670
Is this too many computations
or is this too little

00:47:28.670 --> 00:47:30.090
computations?

00:47:30.090 --> 00:47:32.790
And if you're looking in the
power-limited regime, what we

00:47:32.790 --> 00:47:36.270
really want is to see the
complexity per information bit

00:47:36.270 --> 00:47:38.810
because we normalize things
per information bit.

00:47:38.810 --> 00:47:41.730
Now, how many bits are sent
when you have orthogonal

00:47:41.730 --> 00:47:43.510
signal set of size M?

00:47:43.510 --> 00:47:45.050
We have log M bits, right?

00:47:45.050 --> 00:47:47.290
So this quantity is actually
exponential in the number of

00:47:47.290 --> 00:47:50.360
transmitted bits that we are
sending, and so in fact this

00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:52.385
is quite slow.

00:47:52.385 --> 00:47:54.480
Or in other words we are saying
it is we require M

00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:57.640
times 2 to the M computations,
where M is the number of

00:47:57.640 --> 00:48:01.295
information bits that
we are sending.

00:48:01.295 --> 00:48:04.220
AUDIENCE: So if M is the size
of your [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:04.220 --> 00:48:06.127
then you have log M bits?

00:48:06.127 --> 00:48:07.558
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:48:07.558 --> 00:48:09.470
AUDIENCE: So M log M
over log M is M.

00:48:09.470 --> 00:48:11.195
PROFESSOR: Why are
you adding by M?

00:48:11.195 --> 00:48:13.690
AUDIENCE: You need M log M
operations to decode a symbol.

00:48:13.690 --> 00:48:15.190
PROFESSOR: To decode a symbol.

00:48:15.190 --> 00:48:18.020
AUDIENCE: And each symbol
gives you log M bits.

00:48:18.020 --> 00:48:21.650
So you have M operations
per bit.

00:48:21.650 --> 00:48:24.080
PROFESSOR: Well, when you send,
say, log M bits, right,

00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:26.290
you can only send one of
the M possible symbols.

00:48:29.860 --> 00:48:32.100
And when you want to decode the
symbol, you would end up

00:48:32.100 --> 00:48:33.350
recovering log M bits.

00:48:35.630 --> 00:48:38.928
So you should not be
dividing by M here.

00:48:38.928 --> 00:48:42.030
AUDIENCE: You're dividing by log
M because you want to do

00:48:42.030 --> 00:48:43.730
it per bit.

00:48:43.730 --> 00:48:44.710
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:48:44.710 --> 00:48:44.960
You're right.

00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:47.330
So you're dividing by log M.
You have M log M bits.

00:48:47.330 --> 00:48:51.276
You're dividing by log M,
so you still have --

00:48:51.276 --> 00:48:55.240
AUDIENCE: You have M
calculations per bit.

00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:56.490
[INAUDIBLE]

00:49:02.870 --> 00:49:06.040
PROFESSOR: So we are sending
-- so I need this many

00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:09.990
computations to get
log M bits.

00:49:12.590 --> 00:49:17.359
So is this expression
exponential in log M or not?

00:49:20.670 --> 00:49:23.310
So that's all I was saying.

00:49:23.310 --> 00:49:25.350
AUDIENCE: I just put it another
way that you could

00:49:25.350 --> 00:49:27.170
divide by log M.

00:49:27.170 --> 00:49:28.440
PROFESSOR: M for information,
right.

00:49:32.900 --> 00:49:35.050
OK, are there any questions?

00:49:35.050 --> 00:49:37.510
I mean we are both agreeing to
the fact that this is too many

00:49:37.510 --> 00:49:39.030
computations than
you would want.

00:49:39.030 --> 00:49:43.730
And there exist other decoding
algorithms for which the

00:49:43.730 --> 00:49:46.605
number of computations is much
smaller than exponential.

00:49:54.290 --> 00:49:58.280
OK, so let's next look at the
bandwidth-limited regime.

00:50:12.110 --> 00:50:15.500
Well, actually before that I
wanted to mention a couple of

00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:18.370
other signal sets as well.

00:50:18.370 --> 00:50:20.780
So there are two other important
class of signal sets

00:50:20.780 --> 00:50:24.050
which are related to the
orthogonal signal sets.

00:50:24.050 --> 00:50:28.090
The first is this class of
simplex signal sets.

00:50:31.580 --> 00:50:41.065
And the other class is
bi-orthogonal signal sets.

00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:49.910
So the idea behind simplex
signal sets goes back to the

00:50:49.910 --> 00:50:53.300
observation that was made that
we have a non-zero mean for

00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:54.960
this signal set here.

00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:57.850
So if we do, we can indeed
subtract of the mean and get a

00:50:57.850 --> 00:51:00.430
performance which is
better than the

00:51:00.430 --> 00:51:02.070
orthogonal signal set.

00:51:02.070 --> 00:51:05.450
So in particular if I subtract
of the mean here, I get a

00:51:05.450 --> 00:51:09.560
signal set, which
is like this.

00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:14.090
This is the simplex signal
set when M equals 2.

00:51:14.090 --> 00:51:18.730
When M equals 3, I'm going to
subtract of the mean from this

00:51:18.730 --> 00:51:19.390
plane here.

00:51:19.390 --> 00:51:21.980
The points lie on this
particular plane.

00:51:21.980 --> 00:51:25.570
And what I end up with is
an equilateral triangle.

00:51:25.570 --> 00:51:29.580
So this is the case
when M equals 3.

00:51:29.580 --> 00:51:32.960
What do you think M equals
4 would look like?

00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:36.020
A tetrahedron right here.

00:51:36.020 --> 00:51:39.930
That's a simplex signal set.

00:51:39.930 --> 00:51:45.410
So basically, it's also not too
hard to write an algebraic

00:51:45.410 --> 00:51:47.820
expression for these
signal sets.

00:51:47.820 --> 00:51:55.720
E of A prime is going to be
E of A minus M of A. You

00:51:55.720 --> 00:52:00.590
subtract off the mean from your
orthogonal signal set.

00:52:00.590 --> 00:52:03.460
If I want to write it in terms
of inner products, the inner

00:52:03.460 --> 00:52:13.450
product between ai and aj is
given by E(A) if i equals j.

00:52:13.450 --> 00:52:21.610
And it's I believe minus of 1
over M minus 1 times E(A) if i

00:52:21.610 --> 00:52:23.220
is not equal to j.

00:52:23.220 --> 00:52:26.340
So this is the inner product
between ai and aj.

00:52:26.340 --> 00:52:28.850
And I mean there are also many
properties of this simplex

00:52:28.850 --> 00:52:31.652
signal set, but I believe that
that's going to be in your

00:52:31.652 --> 00:52:33.960
next homework exercise
so I'm not going

00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:35.780
into too many details.

00:52:35.780 --> 00:52:38.360
What' the spectral efficiency
in this case going to be?

00:52:45.346 --> 00:52:46.850
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:52:46.850 --> 00:52:49.040
So what is a simplex?

00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:52.270
Is a simplex just a reference to
anything with [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:52.270 --> 00:52:54.990
PROFESSOR: Simplex signal set is
derived from the orthogonal

00:52:54.990 --> 00:52:57.560
signal set by subtracting
off its mean.

00:52:57.560 --> 00:52:59.935
AUDIENCE: Right, but in general
simplex means anything

00:52:59.935 --> 00:53:01.840
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:03.170
PROFESSOR: I'm not
sure about that.

00:53:08.940 --> 00:53:12.188
What's the spectral efficiency
going to be?

00:53:12.188 --> 00:53:13.438
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:18.536
PROFESSOR: Well, almost.

00:53:18.536 --> 00:53:19.030
AUDIENCE: You use
one dimension.

00:53:19.030 --> 00:53:21.285
PROFESSOR: Right, you just
use one dimension.

00:53:27.230 --> 00:53:30.650
OK, and there are other
properties that you'll be

00:53:30.650 --> 00:53:32.420
looking at it in the homework.

00:53:32.420 --> 00:53:34.692
Now the idea behind this --

00:53:34.692 --> 00:53:35.942
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:39.660 --> 00:53:44.390
PROFESSOR: This is 2 log
M over [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:44.390 --> 00:53:48.510
So the idea behind the
bi-orthogonal signal set is

00:53:48.510 --> 00:53:51.870
you start with an orthogonal
signal set, and for each

00:53:51.870 --> 00:53:54.240
point, you also put the
negative signal of it.

00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:56.830
So in addition to this, you will
have a point here, and

00:53:56.830 --> 00:53:58.520
you will have a point here.

00:53:58.520 --> 00:54:03.770
So the case in two dimensions, M
equals 2, you will have four

00:54:03.770 --> 00:54:09.270
points like this.

00:54:09.270 --> 00:54:16.510
So in this case you are
increasing the number of

00:54:16.510 --> 00:54:25.830
signal points by a
factor of two.

00:54:30.440 --> 00:54:32.380
But this does come at
a price, right?

00:54:32.380 --> 00:54:35.280
Because if you're increasing the
number of signal points,

00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:37.450
the number of nearest neighbors
is also going to

00:54:37.450 --> 00:54:39.300
increase by a factor of two.

00:54:39.300 --> 00:54:41.410
In this case, you have two
nearest neighbors now.

00:55:07.210 --> 00:55:09.540
So you have both of the
effects going on.

00:55:09.540 --> 00:55:12.680
I mean ultimately, all the
signal sets, as M goes to

00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:15.570
infinity, are going to approach
the Shannon limit.

00:55:15.570 --> 00:55:18.510
So again, but they do suffer
from the same kind of

00:55:18.510 --> 00:55:21.270
drawbacks that we saw for the
orthogonal signal sets.

00:55:21.270 --> 00:55:23.830
So these are more of theoretical
interest as

00:55:23.830 --> 00:55:28.130
opposed to real, practical
implementation points.

00:55:28.130 --> 00:55:29.380
Any questions?

00:55:33.540 --> 00:55:34.790
AUDIENCE: Minus [INAUDIBLE]

00:55:37.310 --> 00:55:38.570
PROFESSOR: It's a bit
involved to show.

00:55:38.570 --> 00:55:42.760
I think you'll be showing it
in the homework exercise or

00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:46.530
for an exam problem
at one point.

00:55:46.530 --> 00:55:50.710
You basically start with the
orthogonal signal sets here,

00:55:50.710 --> 00:55:54.590
look at the inner product here,
and use the relation

00:55:54.590 --> 00:55:57.110
between the simplex signal sets
and the orthogonal signal

00:55:57.110 --> 00:55:59.770
sets to do a subtraction
of the mean.

00:55:59.770 --> 00:56:01.445
And then you can derive in
a product expression.

00:56:59.690 --> 00:57:02.265
OK, so let's now move on to the
bandwidth-limited regime.

00:57:18.548 --> 00:57:20.990
OK, so the main difference
between --

00:57:20.990 --> 00:57:22.946
yes?

00:57:22.946 --> 00:57:24.196
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:57:29.220 --> 00:57:31.040
PROFESSOR: You mean here?

00:57:31.040 --> 00:57:32.120
For each --

00:57:32.120 --> 00:57:33.503
AUDIENCE: How far can
you [INAUDIBLE]?

00:57:33.503 --> 00:57:36.270
PROFESSOR: A factor of two.

00:57:36.270 --> 00:57:37.550
I said a factor right?

00:57:37.550 --> 00:57:39.850
So if you have M points in the
orthogonal signal set, you

00:57:39.850 --> 00:57:44.690
have 2M points in the
bi-orthogonal signal set

00:57:44.690 --> 00:57:45.940
because for each --

00:57:48.460 --> 00:57:52.470
AUDIENCE: In the orthogonal
sets you have 3.

00:57:52.470 --> 00:57:56.050
PROFESSOR: And in
this you have 6.

00:57:56.050 --> 00:58:00.290
So let's look at the
bandwidth-limited regime.

00:58:00.290 --> 00:58:03.480
The trade-off we care about is
the probability of error for

00:58:03.480 --> 00:58:06.260
two dimensions as a function
of SNR norm.

00:58:09.410 --> 00:58:10.960
OK?

00:58:10.960 --> 00:58:15.530
The baseline scheme here
is your M-PAM scheme.

00:58:15.530 --> 00:58:18.210
And we showed a couple of
lectures ago that the

00:58:18.210 --> 00:58:22.460
probability of error for two
dimensions is approximately 4

00:58:22.460 --> 00:58:24.542
Q times root 3 SNR norm.

00:58:24.542 --> 00:58:25.792
OK?

00:58:30.420 --> 00:58:32.450
So let's plot the performance
graph.

00:58:40.576 --> 00:58:43.810
So on the x-axis I
plot SNR norm.

00:58:43.810 --> 00:58:47.980
On the y-axis I plot Ps of E
again on a log-log scale.

00:58:53.310 --> 00:58:55.770
This is ten to the negative six,
ten to the negative five,

00:58:55.770 --> 00:58:57.010
ten to the negative four,
ten to the negative

00:58:57.010 --> 00:58:59.140
three and so on.

00:58:59.140 --> 00:59:02.900
The intercept is at 0
dB, this point here.

00:59:02.900 --> 00:59:05.420
So this is your Shannon
limit in the

00:59:05.420 --> 00:59:08.320
bandwidth-limited regime.

00:59:08.320 --> 00:59:12.560
Now your performance curve is
going to be something like

00:59:12.560 --> 00:59:14.010
this for the M-PAM system.

00:59:22.710 --> 00:59:28.480
And we want to basically
quantify now the effective

00:59:28.480 --> 00:59:30.650
coding gain in this regime.

00:59:30.650 --> 00:59:33.900
So it's the same story as in
the power-limited regime.

00:59:33.900 --> 00:59:39.610
We will start off with the
probability of error using the

00:59:39.610 --> 00:59:51.000
union bound estimate, which is
K_min of A times Q of d_min

00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:52.575
over 2 sigma.

00:59:55.620 --> 01:00:00.460
Now Ps of E is the probability
of error for two dimensions.

01:00:00.460 --> 01:00:04.740
Assuming we have N dimensions
here, it is two times the

01:00:04.740 --> 01:00:10.400
probability of error over N.
So this is probability of

01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:12.140
error per symbol.

01:00:12.140 --> 01:00:15.120
We are dividing by the number of
dimensions and multiplying

01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:18.770
by two because it is
for two dimensions.

01:00:18.770 --> 01:00:28.980
And this is going to be 2 times
K_min of A over N, times

01:00:28.980 --> 01:00:32.230
Q of d_min over 2 sigma.

01:00:39.530 --> 01:00:41.900
So now let's do the same trick
that we did in the

01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:43.150
power-limited regime.

01:00:46.110 --> 01:00:49.860
We will write Ps of E
be approximately --

01:00:49.860 --> 01:00:53.980
and instead of the right hand
side, I will write it as Ks of

01:00:53.980 --> 01:01:01.950
A times Q of root 3 SNR norm.

01:01:06.390 --> 01:01:08.900
But because I have a factor of
four up there, I will also

01:01:08.900 --> 01:01:12.790
multiply and divide by 4.

01:01:12.790 --> 01:01:16.024
That's not going to
change anything.

01:01:16.024 --> 01:01:17.888
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:01:17.888 --> 01:01:19.470
per two dimensions
or by symbol.

01:01:19.470 --> 01:01:20.925
PROFESSOR: Per two dimensions.

01:01:20.925 --> 01:01:23.510
And for bandwidth-limited
regime, we normalize

01:01:23.510 --> 01:01:24.600
everything by two dimensions.

01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:28.222
AUDIENCE: But for N band we used
it for symbols, right?

01:01:28.222 --> 01:01:30.790
The calculations represent --

01:01:30.790 --> 01:01:32.040
PROFESSOR: No, it was
for two dimensions.

01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:42.120
OK?, so now let's compare
the two expressions.

01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:50.960
We have Ks of A, which we'll
define by two times K_min of A

01:01:50.960 --> 01:02:05.810
over N. And this is the number
of nearest neighbors per two

01:02:05.810 --> 01:02:08.740
dimensions.

01:02:08.740 --> 01:02:19.780
And I can write 3 times SNR norm
is d_min squared over 4

01:02:19.780 --> 01:02:27.970
sigma squared, OK?

01:02:27.970 --> 01:02:30.550
Actually, I was missing
this factor of gamma.

01:02:30.550 --> 01:02:32.070
I knew I was missing
something.

01:02:32.070 --> 01:02:34.970
It's not just 3 SNR norm.

01:02:34.970 --> 01:02:39.090
It's 3 times this nominal coding
gain times SNR norm.

01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:47.550
So 3 times SNR norm times
gamma_c of A here.

01:02:47.550 --> 01:02:50.020
So this is d_min squared
over 2N_0.

01:02:54.850 --> 01:03:02.470
So what do I have for the
gamma_c c o A is d_min squared

01:03:02.470 --> 01:03:06.070
over 6 N_0 times SNR norm.

01:03:08.740 --> 01:03:12.480
Remember SNR norm is SNR over
2 to the rho minus 1.

01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:15.730
It's normalized signal-to-noise
ratio.

01:03:15.730 --> 01:03:20.890
So this is the d_min squared
times 2 to the rho minus 1

01:03:20.890 --> 01:03:24.300
over 6 times N_0 times SNR.

01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:27.390
But N_0 times SNR is just Es.

01:03:27.390 --> 01:03:30.180
So this is 6 times Es.

01:03:30.180 --> 01:03:31.740
So this is the expression
you have for the

01:03:31.740 --> 01:03:32.990
nominal coding gain.

01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:52.140
So now again, given a signal
set A, I can find those two

01:03:52.140 --> 01:03:59.370
parameters, the nominal coding
gain and the number of nearest

01:03:59.370 --> 01:04:01.440
neighbors per two dimensions.

01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:05.686
And I can use those to
plot on the Ps of E

01:04:05.686 --> 01:04:07.990
versus SNR norm curve.

01:04:07.990 --> 01:04:09.405
Again, the exact same story.

01:04:12.940 --> 01:04:17.920
If I have a certain nominal
coding gain, I will simply

01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:23.460
shift my curve around the x-axis
by that factor as a

01:04:23.460 --> 01:04:25.550
pure translation.

01:04:25.550 --> 01:04:32.120
And then because I have a factor
of Ks A over 4, I'm

01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:33.396
going to plot --

01:04:33.396 --> 01:04:35.340
how did that expression go?

01:04:35.340 --> 01:04:37.590
This expression on the top.

01:04:37.590 --> 01:04:41.440
Remember this curve here is 4
times root 3 SNR norm, right?

01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:44.740
So the multiplicative factor
I have is Ks(A) over 4.

01:04:44.740 --> 01:04:46.880
So I will shift my curve
up by that factor.

01:04:50.180 --> 01:04:52.360
And I will get something
which is like this.

01:04:57.110 --> 01:05:00.430
And that's my union bound
estimate for this new

01:05:00.430 --> 01:05:04.470
constellation A.

01:05:04.470 --> 01:05:06.340
The distance here is
gamma effective.

01:05:08.990 --> 01:05:19.400
This distance here is gamma_c of
A. Are there any questions?

01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:21.870
So now we also have a similar
rule of thumb as in the

01:05:21.870 --> 01:05:24.450
power-limited regime.

01:05:24.450 --> 01:05:27.140
I will write that rule
of thumb here.

01:05:27.140 --> 01:05:34.430
We have that gamma effective is
going to be gamma_c in dB

01:05:34.430 --> 01:05:43.020
minus 0.2 times log2 times
Ks of A over 4 in dB.

01:05:46.670 --> 01:05:51.400
OK, so again, a factor of 2NKs
will decrease your nominal

01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:54.830
coding gain by a factor
of 0.2 in dB.

01:05:58.620 --> 01:05:59.870
Are there any questions?

01:06:03.260 --> 01:06:06.260
Well, so I mean this is the
end of chapter five.

01:06:06.260 --> 01:06:08.830
We still have like ten minutes
remaining, so I thought I

01:06:08.830 --> 01:06:11.480
would give you a preview
of the next chapter.

01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:13.510
Professor Forney will be coming
next class, and he will

01:06:13.510 --> 01:06:15.970
be starting chapter six
all over I believe.

01:06:19.030 --> 01:06:21.303
This chalk is much nicer to
erase than that other one.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:48.650
So in chapter six, we'll
be looking at the

01:06:48.650 --> 01:06:49.900
binary block codes.

01:07:00.130 --> 01:07:04.540
OK, and what is the main
architecture of these codes?

01:07:04.540 --> 01:07:09.700
Well, for an encoder, remember
we have K bits coming in.

01:07:09.700 --> 01:07:12.315
And we pass it now through
a binary block code.

01:07:16.070 --> 01:07:23.220
And what we get out is
a binary sequence

01:07:23.220 --> 01:07:25.425
of length N. OK?

01:07:25.425 --> 01:07:31.750
So x belongs to c, where c is
a subset of binary sequences

01:07:31.750 --> 01:07:33.550
of length N.

01:07:33.550 --> 01:07:37.240
So we start with K bits, and
we convert them to N bits,

01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:42.610
where N is going to be greater
than or equal to K. Once we

01:07:42.610 --> 01:07:46.590
have this sequence of N bits,
what we end up doing is we

01:07:46.590 --> 01:07:49.820
pass it through a binary
signal constellation.

01:07:54.710 --> 01:07:56.690
So I'm writing in as
binary signaling.

01:07:56.690 --> 01:08:02.200
And what we get out is
S of x, which is a

01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:04.940
sequence of N symbols.

01:08:04.940 --> 01:08:07.110
Each symbol can either take
value minus alpha or alpha.

01:08:07.110 --> 01:08:12.130
So this binary signalling is
actually quite a trivial step.

01:08:12.130 --> 01:08:16.560
Basically, the relation is S of
0 is going to be alpha, S

01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:18.500
of 1 is going to
be minus alpha.

01:08:18.500 --> 01:08:21.520
If I have a 0 coming in, I
will produce an alpha.

01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:24.520
if I have a 1 coming in, I will
produce a minus alpha.

01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:26.689
So this part here is trivial.

01:08:26.689 --> 01:08:29.253
All our energy will be
focused on will be

01:08:29.253 --> 01:08:31.340
to find a good code.

01:08:31.340 --> 01:08:33.970
Given a sequence of input bits,
we want to find a good

01:08:33.970 --> 01:08:39.080
binary code in order to
optimize the minimum

01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:40.880
distance and so on.

01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:43.540
So that's the architecture that
we will be using for the

01:08:43.540 --> 01:08:45.210
binary linear codes.

01:08:45.210 --> 01:08:46.800
Both chapters six and
eight will be only

01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:48.250
focusing on this part.

01:08:48.250 --> 01:08:50.550
And this binary signalling
scheme, for the most part,

01:08:50.550 --> 01:08:52.265
will be implicit in
our architecture.

01:08:55.069 --> 01:08:58.399
So at this point, one might ask
is there anything to lose

01:08:58.399 --> 01:09:01.359
in having imposed this
type of architecture?

01:09:01.359 --> 01:09:03.899
Remember, the nice thing about
this architecture is we have

01:09:03.899 --> 01:09:06.910
coding, which is going on here,
and we have modulation

01:09:06.910 --> 01:09:08.460
that is happening here.

01:09:08.460 --> 01:09:10.960
And the modulation step
is quite simple.

01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:23.156
So we have a separation between
coding and modulation.

01:09:23.156 --> 01:09:24.406
OK?

01:09:29.689 --> 01:09:32.600
And the question is, is this
the right thing to do?

01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:34.520
Now, it turns out that if we
are going to live in this

01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:36.984
binary world where we are only
constrained ourselves to

01:09:36.984 --> 01:09:40.134
sending binary signals over the
channel, this is in fact

01:09:40.134 --> 01:09:41.800
an economical structure.

01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:44.310
There isn't much improvement we
can get, and that is quite

01:09:44.310 --> 01:09:45.424
obvious, right?

01:09:45.424 --> 01:09:48.410
But it turns out that if you are
going to go for non-binary

01:09:48.410 --> 01:09:51.870
signaling, particularly in the
bandwidth-limited regime,

01:09:51.870 --> 01:09:55.460
there is a cost to be paid for
this kind of separation.

01:09:55.460 --> 01:09:57.950
In fact, in the 1980's there
was this whole idea of

01:09:57.950 --> 01:10:01.060
turbo-coded modulation or
trellis-coded modulation.

01:10:01.060 --> 01:10:03.680
And the idea there was to
combine coding and modulation

01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:05.110
in one step.

01:10:05.110 --> 01:10:19.440
So this is not optimal for
non-binary signalling, but's

01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:25.270
it's OK for binary.

01:10:30.570 --> 01:10:33.820
So we will be focusing on this
type of an architecture.

01:10:33.820 --> 01:10:37.130
The other issue is OK, nobody
told us that you can only send

01:10:37.130 --> 01:10:39.080
binary signals over
the channel.

01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:42.270
If you want to achieve the
Shannon limit, when we derived

01:10:42.270 --> 01:10:44.580
the capacity expression --

01:10:44.580 --> 01:10:46.970
or we just stated it but
you can derive it.

01:10:46.970 --> 01:10:49.660
We said that the Shannon
limit is always less

01:10:49.660 --> 01:10:52.830
than log2 1 plus SNR.

01:10:52.830 --> 01:10:55.980
And we never said that we can
only send binary signals over

01:10:55.980 --> 01:10:56.840
the channel.

01:10:56.840 --> 01:10:59.070
So it could be that this is some
inherence of optimality

01:10:59.070 --> 01:11:00.770
in this type of architecture.

01:11:00.770 --> 01:11:03.730
Why send binary signals
in the first place?

01:11:03.730 --> 01:11:06.940
Again, it turns out that the
regime that we are interested

01:11:06.940 --> 01:11:10.130
in here is the power-limited
regime because the spectral

01:11:10.130 --> 01:11:12.220
efficiency can never be more
than two bits per two

01:11:12.220 --> 01:11:13.810
dimensions, right?

01:11:13.810 --> 01:11:16.340
Remember, rho is 2K over N here,
and K is going to be

01:11:16.340 --> 01:11:17.290
less than that.

01:11:17.290 --> 01:11:22.130
So we are inherently in the
power-limited regime.

01:11:22.130 --> 01:11:24.770
And so a natural thing to do
in order to understand how

01:11:24.770 --> 01:11:28.120
much fundamental loss we have
in imposing this type of

01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:32.360
binary constraint over the
signals is to not look at this

01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:36.470
expression, but to find the best
possible performance we

01:11:36.470 --> 01:11:39.390
can have if we constrain
ourselves to binary signals

01:11:39.390 --> 01:11:41.090
over the channel.

01:11:41.090 --> 01:11:43.910
If we impose a certain signaling
constraint, we can

01:11:43.910 --> 01:11:49.330
find another fundamental limit
on the spectral efficiency.

01:11:49.330 --> 01:11:53.070
So the point being, the best
possible binary code can only

01:11:53.070 --> 01:11:55.450
achieve this upper bound here.

01:11:55.450 --> 01:11:57.050
Now, this upper bound
has to be less than

01:11:57.050 --> 01:11:58.300
log2 1 plus SNR, right?

01:12:03.170 --> 01:12:06.070
Because the Shannon code assumes
the binary signaling

01:12:06.070 --> 01:12:07.640
is a special case.

01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:10.700
So it turns out that this
expression is actually quite

01:12:10.700 --> 01:12:12.310
tedious to write out.

01:12:12.310 --> 01:12:15.090
I'm not even sure if the
closed-form expression exists,

01:12:15.090 --> 01:12:16.820
but you can calculate
this numerically.

01:12:16.820 --> 01:12:19.760
It's just some kind of a convex
optimization problem.

01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:22.350
And now, to understand how
much loss we have, we can

01:12:22.350 --> 01:12:26.090
compare the two expressions in
the power-limited regime.

01:12:26.090 --> 01:12:30.690
So I'm going to plot the curves
for the two cases.

01:12:30.690 --> 01:12:35.350
I'm going to plot the spectral
efficiency on the y-axis as a

01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:36.500
function of Eb N_0.

01:12:36.500 --> 01:12:39.000
You can easily convert from
SNR to Eb N_0 using the

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:42.210
relations we discussed
in chapter four.

01:12:42.210 --> 01:12:45.030
Now we first plot the
Shannon limit.

01:12:45.030 --> 01:12:48.920
The ultimate Shannon limit
is minus 1.59 dB.

01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:52.000
This is going to be 0 dB here.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.100
And if I'm plot the Shannon
limit, it will be

01:12:54.100 --> 01:12:56.260
some code like this.

01:12:56.260 --> 01:12:58.080
It increases with Eb N_0.

01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:01.210
And minus 1.59 dB is 0.

01:13:01.210 --> 01:13:03.130
This point here is 1.

01:13:03.130 --> 01:13:05.070
Some point here is 2.

01:13:05.070 --> 01:13:09.200
So actually I want to draw this
horizontal asymptote at

01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:13.030
two when rho Shannon equals 2.

01:13:13.030 --> 01:13:15.720
So this is my rho Shannon.

01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:19.200
Now, I can now also plot
rho binary from

01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:21.020
this expression here.

01:13:21.020 --> 01:13:23.220
I can never exceed two bits
per two dimensions.

01:13:23.220 --> 01:13:25.720
So I had plotted this
horizontal line.

01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:28.720
So as Eb N_0 goes to infinity,
the most I can get is two bits

01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:30.250
per two dimensions.

01:13:30.250 --> 01:13:35.380
If Eb N_0 is smaller, I cannot
do better so I will be doing

01:13:35.380 --> 01:13:38.210
worse and worse, and I will
always be below this line.

01:13:38.210 --> 01:13:41.330
Ultimately, it can be shown
that I will have the same

01:13:41.330 --> 01:13:43.210
Shannon limit here.

01:13:43.210 --> 01:13:45.020
So this is rho binary.

01:13:48.380 --> 01:13:51.830
And the main observation here is
if I'm in the power-limited

01:13:51.830 --> 01:13:55.150
regime, which is say, in this
part of the curve --

01:13:55.150 --> 01:13:57.650
like, say around one bit per two
dimension -- the gap here

01:13:57.650 --> 01:13:59.390
is quite small.

01:13:59.390 --> 01:14:02.620
In fact, this gap can be shown
to be at most 0.2 dB.

01:14:05.190 --> 01:14:08.130
So if I want to achieve a
certain spectral efficiency,

01:14:08.130 --> 01:14:10.855
if I impose a binary signaling
constraint, the additional Eb

01:14:10.855 --> 01:14:15.300
N_0 that I require when the
spectral efficiency is 1 dB,

01:14:15.300 --> 01:14:18.360
one bit per two dimensions,
is at most 0.2 dB.

01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:22.280
So there is not much to lose by
imposing a binary signaling

01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:23.870
constraint.

01:14:23.870 --> 01:14:26.220
Said in different words words
if you had the best possible

01:14:26.220 --> 01:14:29.150
binary linear code, followed
by a binary signaling

01:14:29.150 --> 01:14:33.210
constellation, the most you
can lose is 0.2 dB.

01:14:33.210 --> 01:14:36.070
And so this type of an
architecture does make sense.

01:14:36.070 --> 01:14:39.783
There are a lot of details that
the next powerpoint will

01:14:39.783 --> 01:14:44.680
be to kind of formalize the
notion of a binary block code,

01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:46.850
then specialize it to the
case of binary linear

01:14:46.850 --> 01:14:48.450
codes and so on.

01:14:48.450 --> 01:14:51.370
Unfortunately, the first thing
to do is to start with some

01:14:51.370 --> 01:14:54.970
finite field theory because
there's a lot of finite field

01:14:54.970 --> 01:14:57.780
algebra involved in this
algebraic block codes.

01:14:57.780 --> 01:15:02.580
So how many of you have seen
finite field theory before?

01:15:02.580 --> 01:15:05.810
OK, if you haven't seen it,
don't worry about it.

01:15:05.810 --> 01:15:08.570
We'll be starting right
from the basics.

01:15:08.570 --> 01:15:11.580
But I think I will be stopping
here for today because I don't

01:15:11.580 --> 01:15:13.390
want to go into those
details today.
