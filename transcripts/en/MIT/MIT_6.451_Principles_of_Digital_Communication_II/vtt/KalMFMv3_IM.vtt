00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.180
PROFESSOR: OK, well I'm
going to start now.

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:07.735
As I say, I know that the
wireless course has its final

00:00:07.735 --> 00:00:11.720
at 11:00, so we might not see
the people who are taking it.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.770
Is anyone here in the
wireless course?

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:16.510
OK.

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:21.860
Q.E.D. Ipso facto ergo sum.

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.590
OK, just to remind you, I think
we have Problem Set 10

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:26.270
solutions today.

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.510
In any case, they'll be
available on the web.

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.300
The final is next Tuesday.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.540
Do bring calculators
if you have them.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.170
They won't be absolutely
essential, but

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:40.420
they might be useful.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.340
You may bring five
sheets of notes.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.680
It's a good exercise
to make these up.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.480
And otherwise, it's
closed-book.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.860
Ashish will hold a review
session tomorrow, 4:00 to

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:04.084
6:00, 26-328, which I'm sure
will be excellent as usual.

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.120
All right, just to remind you,
we're in Chapter 14.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.590
Most of the course we talked
about coding for power-limited

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.070
channels, where basically you
could get away with binary

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.010
codes with very little
loss of optimality.

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.070
For bandwidth-limited, additive
white Gaussian noise

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.890
channels, we've got to
consider non-binary,

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.680
multi-level codes, we've really
got to go out into

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.820
Euclidian space and use
Euclidian distance as our

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.390
metric rather than
Hamming distance.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.750
So we started out with a simple
idea, build a lattice

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.610
constellation.

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.440
A lattice is an infinite set
of points in end space that

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.030
has a group property.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.640
That's it, a discrete
set of points.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.450
We take a finite set of them by
chopping out a region R, a

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.620
compact region, which chops out
a finite number of points

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.220
in this lattice or in a
translate of the lattice.

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.060
And we went through this
exercise of computing the

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.470
union-bound estimate, which I
remind you is a reasonable

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.280
estimate for codes that
are not too complex.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.430
We're not going to use this for

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.450
capacity-approaching codes.

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.840
But for codes, where...,
basically dominated by minimum

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.080
distance properties, how many
nearest neighbors are there,

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.580
the likeliest error events are
all to the nearest neighbors,

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.980
we can use the union-bound
estimate, which basically just

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.940
tallies the probability of error
to the nearest neighbor

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.320
events by the union-bound, which
itself is inaccurate if

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.830
you get too many near
neighbor events.

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.320
And we've got this nice
approximate expression that

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.520
the probability of error per n
dimensions, if we're signaling

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.640
in n dimensions, is the number
of nearest neighbors in the

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:09.310
lattice times the Q to the
square root of a function

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.760
times an expression, which
involves a coding gain of the

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.110
lattice, and separably a shaping
gain of the region

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.490
times 3 times SNR norm.

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:25.910
So this embodies all kinds
of simplifications.

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.540
It separates the effects of the
lattice and the region.

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.710
Basically, we can optimize each
of these separately to

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:34.720
optimize this expression.

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.200
And also, by the way, by talking
about SNR norm, which

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:45.520
is SNR normalized by 2 to the
spectral efficiency, it makes

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.520
this whole expression
independent of rate or

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.420
equivalently independent
of spectral efficiency.

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.690
We saw this back when we talked
about m by m QAM, we

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.285
got a universal expression.

00:03:58.285 --> 00:04:02.210
The probability of error was
simply this expression with a

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:06.550
3SNR norm in here - regardless
of what m was (regardless of

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:09.730
how big the QAM constellation
was), we got the same

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:10.920
approximate expression.

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.550
So this is also independent of
the size of the constellations

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:19.200
in this large constellation,
high SNR approximation.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.450
Once you get to enough points,
everything sort of washes out.

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.760
So it's very useful.

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.170
And I remind you that the coding
gain basically depends

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:36.650
on the minimum square distance
normalized by the density of

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.270
the lattice, if you like,
normalized to two dimensions.

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:45.700
The shaping gain is basically
the shaping gain of an n-cube

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:46.780
divided by--

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.310
this is the normalized second
moment of an n-cube, this is

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.140
the normalized second moment of
your region, which better

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:55.730
be better than that of an
n-cube, meaning smaller.

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:59.920
And writing it out, it's equal
to this, where this is the

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.970
second moment of your region.

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:06.840
And this is the volume, again,
normalized to two dimensions.

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.520
So the baseline constellations,
we showed

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.840
these were invariant to
Cartesian products.

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.520
In any number of dimensions,
n, we can take the integer

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:21.520
lattice or any translate of the
integer lattice and we can

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.300
take a region, which
is the n-cube --

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.250
which will chop out basically
a square or cubic

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:30.590
constellation, a regular
constellation in n

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:31.660
dimensions--

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.980
and we'll get that the coding
gain is the shaping gain is 1.

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:42.860
So we'll get just our baseline
expression for any integer

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:47.880
lattice shaped by an n-cube
centered on the origin.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.100
And this is what
it looks like.

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:53.170
This is back from Chapter
Four or whatever.

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:56.720
We get this universal curve,
the baseline curve, which

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:01.930
holds for m-PAM, m by m QAM, or
you can Cartesian product

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.870
these up into as high a
dimension as you like.

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:08.610
The constellation we're talking
about is really m-PAM

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:11.190
Cartesian product to the nth.

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:13.080
For any of those constellations,
if we

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.330
normalize the probability of
error to two dimensions--

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.340
which is what I'm recommending
to you, normalize everything

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:23.480
per two dimensions in the
high SNR regime--

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.240
then we basically get the number
of near neighbors in

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:31.775
Z-squared, the QAM lattice,
which is 4 times Q to the

00:06:31.775 --> 00:06:33.480
square root of 3SNR norm.

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:35.980
And it looks like this.

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:38.260
We plot probability
of error per two

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.940
dimensions over SNR norm.

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:44.160
I think at 10 to the minus
5, it's 8.4 dB.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.770
Does anybody remember?

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:49.000
But it's somewhere
around 9 dB.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.540
And the Shannon limit, as
we recall, is for SNR

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:53.700
norm, it's at 0 dB.

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:56.420
So this is where we can play.

00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:00.090
Any code will fall somewhere
between these two curves, and

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:04.370
the name of the game is to get
a code the gets as close to

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:06.560
the Shannon limit as possible.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:10.300
And at least in this moderate
complexity regime, the way we

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:14.020
play the game is we try to
optimize the shaping region,

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:18.190
we try to optimize the lattice,
we're going to get a

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:21.680
certain gain from shaping, and
a certain gain from coding,

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:27.230
de-rated by the number of
nearest neighbors, which is

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:29.840
going to turn out to be an
important effect for some

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.630
well-known lattices because
they have huge

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:33.210
numbers of near neighbors.

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:36.870
And that will give us some curve
somewhere in here, and

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:38.570
we plot that and we're done.

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:41.290
We've written a paper for
that particular lattice

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:43.245
constellation, for
its performance.

00:07:49.358 --> 00:07:53.840
Today I'm going to talk quickly
about shaping, because

00:07:53.840 --> 00:08:00.390
that's a very easy story,
and obvious, and

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:01.900
it won't take long.

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:05.540
Then I'm going to talk about
lattices, which is really a

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:10.430
subject in mathematics, what's
known about lattices.

00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:13.630
I guess the decoding part of
that story is not mathematics.

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:16.550
That's engineering.

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:21.410
And then I'm going to talk about
trellis codes, which are

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:25.600
the analog of convolutional
codes, and which, similarly to

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:28.090
the way convolutional codes
beat block codes for the

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:30.780
bandwidth for the power-limited
regime, trellis

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:35.140
codes tend to beat lattice codes
in terms of performance

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:40.950
versus complexity for the
bandwidth-limited regime.

00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:42.010
So, shaping.

00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:45.410
Shaping is really an almost
trivial story.

00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:52.200
This really wasn't recognized
as a separable issue until

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:57.650
perhaps sometime in the '80s,
when trellis-coded modulation

00:08:57.650 --> 00:08:58.280
was invented.

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:03.020
In '82 was Ungerboeck's paper.

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:04.900
That was really the
breakthrough in

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:10.240
bandwidth-limited coding, that
trellis codes were the first

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:13.000
bandwidth-limited codes that
were widely implemented.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.950
And after people analyzed them
for a while, they realized

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:19.590
that you could separate out the
shaping effect from the

00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:23.370
coding effect, which is what
I've shown by this expression.

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:28.580
So anyone care to guess what
the optimum region is in n

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:29.980
dimensions?

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:33.480
I guess I've already mentioned
it last time.

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:35.540
The optimum region, what
do we want to do?

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:39.440
We want to minimize the
normalized second moment--

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:44.540
well, a second moment with
appropriate normalization,

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:45.810
what would you do?

00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:47.870
Well, the optimum region for
just about anything is an

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:51.660
n-sphere, and it certainly
is here.

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:54.650
So we take Rn equals
an n-sphere.

00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:04.400
If we have a two-dimensional
sphere, what are its

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:05.650
parameters?

00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:13.810
We certainly know that the
volume of this region, if this

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:15.405
is R, it's pi times R squared.

00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:28.500
And the second moment of this
region, how do we do that?

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:31.670
We integrate ... go to polar
coordinates, 0 to 2pi,

00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:38.190
d pi, 0 to R, rdr.

00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:41.590
And then what are
we measuring?

00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:45.400
The second moment is r squared,
but we normalize it

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:47.020
per dimension, which is 2.

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:55.820
Oh, and we've got to take the
uniform distribution over v of

00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:59.220
R, and that's one over
pi R squared.

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:02.130
So have I got it now?

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:04.970
This is the second moment of
a uniform distribution, a

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:09.100
probability distribution
over the 2-sphere.

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:14.230
And so this will be 1 over
2pi R squared times

00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:19.690
R 4th over 4, right?

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:24.500
Is that all correct?

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:32.510
And so p of R over v of R is
already not normalized to two

00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:35.870
dimensions, so we don't have
to re-normalize it.

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:46.290
I didn't get the 2pi in here.

00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:51.970
I need some help, class.

00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:53.790
When it comes down to
integration, I'm not

00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:56.680
necessarily the world's best.

00:11:56.680 --> 00:12:00.350
So R squared over 4...

00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:09.510
R squared over 4pi R squared,
so we get 1 over 4pi.

00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:10.050
Is that right?

00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:11.670
That looks about right
because it's fairly

00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:12.920
close to 1 over 12.

00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:18.390
So what is the shaping
gain of a 2-sphere?

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:25.680
And I can just say 2-sphere,
because I know it's invariant

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:28.250
to scaling.

00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:31.780
Rotation isn't going
to do much to it.

00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:39.220
It's 1/12 over this, the
normalized second moment, 1

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:47.220
over 4pi, which is pi over 3,
which is about 2/10 of a dB.

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:51.530
OK, so I've improved the second
moment by 2/10 of a dB,

00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:53.920
reduced it to 2/10 of a dB.

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:57.730
This is not very impressive.

00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:00.680
So of course, a lot of the
early work was on shaping

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:02.930
two-dimensional constellations.

00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:06.270
And this basically says if you
get a large constellation, you

00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:10.250
don't even see this effect
to, say, 64-QAM.

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:13.955
If you have a 64-QAM
constellation, 8 by 8--

00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:26.370
Somebody at Paradyne noticed
that you could improve it

00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:30.390
slightly by taking the four
corner points out and putting

00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:34.686
them up here, without reducing
the minimum distance.

00:13:34.686 --> 00:13:40.860
OK, so there is an improved,
more spherical 64-point

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:41.690
constellation.

00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:44.840
It's improved by about 0.1
dB, as I remember.

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:49.710
And what this calculation says
is if you go up to 256, 1024,

00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:55.350
and you simply take all the
points in the QAM grid that

00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:58.830
are surrounded by a sphere of
appropriate size to pick out 2

00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:02.860
to the n points, for high, large
constellations you get a

00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:04.790
gain of about 0.2 dB.

00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:09.030
So this is nothing to
write home about.

00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:11.850
What happens as n goes
to infinity?

00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:19.570
We look up in a math book what
the expressions are for the

00:14:19.570 --> 00:14:23.070
normalized second moment--
actually, you can do it just

00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:26.360
by this kind of calculation.

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:28.010
It's easy enough.

00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:39.475
And just by scaling, you'll find
that the shaping gain of

00:14:39.475 --> 00:14:49.460
the n-sphere goes to pi times
e over 6, which is 1.53 dB.

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:52.630
A famous number not only now
in shaping, but also in

00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:55.850
quantization, where you're also
interested in minimizing

00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:59.560
the second moment of a
quantization cell.

00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:06.450
Or it's something like 0.229
bits per two dimensions, is

00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:08.600
another way of expressing it.

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:12.100
All right, so what is this?

00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:15.090
This is the maximum shaping
gain you could get by the

00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:19.470
optimum region in the optimum
number of dimensions, which is

00:15:19.470 --> 00:15:21.040
as large as you can go.

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:24.090
So this says this is the
ultimate shaping gain.

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:26.120
You can never get a shaping
gain of more

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:29.650
than 1 and 1/2 dB.

00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:34.490
So it says when we play this
game, we've got about 9 dB

00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:37.255
down here that we want to make
up at 10 to the minus 5, 10 to

00:15:37.255 --> 00:15:42.820
the minus 6, we can get only 1
and a 1/2 dB of it by doing

00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:45.260
good shaping in large
dimensions.

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.620
That's the best we
can ever do.

00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:49.390
So that's a little
bit discouraging.

00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:53.230
It says shaping is never going
to give you that much.

00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:57.400
On the other hand, you can't
get this 1 and a 1/2 dB

00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:59.040
in any other way.

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:01.380
If you have n-cubed
constellations, you will

00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:04.870
always be limited to be
1 and a 1/2 dB away

00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:07.570
from the Shannon limit.

00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:09.990
So if you want to approach the
Shannon limit, you do have to

00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:12.230
address the shaping problem.

00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:13.840
You can't ignore it.

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:21.020
1 and a 1/2 dB is enough to be
noticed in most applications,

00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:24.750
so you should do some
moderate shaping.

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:27.240
Now, of course we can
plot the curve.

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:31.280
It's done in the notes for any
n whatsoever, and you'll see

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:34.380
that it goes up fairly
steeply at first.

00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:41.450
It gets to about 1 dB at 16
dimensions, so if you shape in

00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:45.820
a 16 dimensional sphere, you
can get 1 dB out of this

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:48.950
maximum of 1 and a 1/2
dBs you can ever get.

00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:53.170
If you go to 32, it's 1.2 dB
or something like that, it

00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:55.840
begins to slope out.

00:16:55.840 --> 00:17:02.260
So that gives you a good
idea of what you

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:04.109
can actually attain.

00:17:04.109 --> 00:17:09.200
In the V.34 modem, for instance,
a rather simple

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:13.740
shaping scheme is used that
gets up to about 0.8 dB of

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:14.609
shaping gain.

00:17:14.609 --> 00:17:16.840
It's called shaping
on regions.

00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:25.700
I just mentioned some techniques
for shaping.

00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:29.480
As with a lot of things, once
shaping was realized to be a

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:33.220
separate subject from coding,
there was a flurry

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:34.270
of activity on it.

00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:37.670
People basically proposed a
number of different schemes,

00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:41.480
particularly in the context of
the V.34 modem standards

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:42.952
development.

00:17:42.952 --> 00:17:50.010
Of which trellis shaping,
I would

00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:53.000
say, is the most elegant.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:58.210
This is kind of a dual to
trellis-coded modulation where

00:17:58.210 --> 00:18:01.310
we use trellis codes for shaping
rather than coding.

00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:03.290
So that's elegant.

00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:08.440
But a cruder and quite
effective, just fine

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:16.960
technique, shell mapping, was
used in the V.34 modem.

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:21.700
The basic idea here is that
you take a two-dimensional

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:27.000
constellation, you just divide
it into shells like this.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.610
It turns out in two dimensions,
if you take a

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:36.540
constant delta here, that the
average energy goes up, I

00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:42.960
think, linearly with delta or
some way nicely with delta.

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:48.980
You take a constellation bigger
than you really need,

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:50.970
so you have the possibility
of some redundancy.

00:18:56.090 --> 00:18:59.750
So you identify each point in
the constellation by which

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:03.900
region it lands in.

00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:06.220
You then go up to 16 dimensions
or something--

00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:09.770
I think it is 16 dimensions
in the V.34 modem--

00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:17.640
and you assign each series of
points a score depending on

00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:20.690
which shells its
points land in.

00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:27.150
And you basically have a big
table that chooses the lowest

00:19:27.150 --> 00:19:34.100
energy combinations from all the
possible series of eight

00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:37.860
shells, which can be done
fairly elegantly using

00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:39.290
generating function
techniques.

00:19:39.290 --> 00:19:43.010
I realize this is just
hand-waving and you can't get

00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:50.100
it, but the effect is that you
use this shell with very high

00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:50.730
probability.

00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:53.560
You sort of get a Gaussian-like
probability on

00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:55.650
the shells.

00:19:55.650 --> 00:19:57.860
Let me just draw
that like this.

00:19:57.860 --> 00:19:59.750
You don't use the points
out in this

00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:01.410
outermost shell very much.

00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:04.880
You use this a lot, and they
sort of have an overall

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:07.290
Gaussian distribution.

00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:09.720
And I should mention that this
is an equivalent way of

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:10.970
getting shaping gain.

00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:21.270
If we're shaping uniformly over
an n-sphere in a high

00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:26.870
number n of dimensions and we
basically have constellations

00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:32.880
which consist of two-dimensional
QAM points,

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:36.805
what is the projection of a
uniform distribution over an

00:20:36.805 --> 00:20:39.990
n-sphere down onto
two dimensions?

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:43.560
If we look at each
two-dimensional component of

00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:47.266
these n-dimensional vectors,
what distribution will it have

00:20:47.266 --> 00:20:52.180
if we impose a uniform spherical
distribution on the

00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:53.830
high dimensional
constellation?

00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:59.040
It will turn out that it
becomes Gaussian in two

00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:00.560
dimensions.

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:01.750
Think of the projection of the

00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:04.110
2-sphere down on one dimension.

00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:07.580
The projection of a 2-sphere
on one dimension is

00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:09.730
something like this.

00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:14.570
It's not Gaussian, but there's
more probability that one of

00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:18.040
the coordinates will be near 0
than it will be out at one of

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:19.990
these maxima here.

00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:24.230
So this is just the same thing
raised up to n dimensions.

00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:27.020
So an equivalent way of looking
at this problem is we

00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:30.620
want somehow to get a
Gaussian-like distribution on

00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:33.880
a one- or two-dimensional
constellation, and this is one

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:36.390
way of doing it.

00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:40.700
And you can get the same pi
times e over 6 factor by just

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:44.680
looking at it from an entropy
point of view, the entropy of

00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:47.420
a two-dimensional Gaussian
distribution relative to the

00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:51.750
entropy of a uniform
distribution over a square.

00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:54.992
That will give you the
same factor if you

00:21:54.992 --> 00:21:57.300
do everything right.

00:21:57.300 --> 00:22:01.120
OK so basically, shaping
is easy.

00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:04.970
These techniques are not
difficult to implement.

00:22:04.970 --> 00:22:09.320
You can get one dB of shaping
gain quite easily through a

00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:12.230
variety of techniques.

00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:14.550
It's worth getting that one dB,
you're not going to get it

00:22:14.550 --> 00:22:17.050
by any other means.

00:22:17.050 --> 00:22:19.660
But having done that, that's all
you're ever going to get,

00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:22.460
and so end of story
on shaping.

00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:29.260
So as I said, it was a flurry
of activity in the '90s, and

00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:30.510
no one has looked at
shaping since then.

00:22:38.270 --> 00:22:39.870
So that's part of the story.

00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:47.180
Let's continue now with
lattices, an old

00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:48.430
mathematical subject.

00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:55.170
So what we're interested in is,
what's the densest lattice

00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:57.096
packing in n dimensions?

00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:03.380
This appeared in mathematics,
long before it appeared in

00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:05.330
engineering, as Hermite's
parameter.

00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:07.440
And Hermite said this was the
right way to measure the

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:10.540
density of a lattice, normalized
in all the

00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:11.380
appropriate ways.

00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:15.290
So any version of a lattice
is equivalent.

00:23:15.290 --> 00:23:18.960
A version is something that you
get by scaling or rotating

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:24.020
or even by Cartesian products,
which I'm not sure how

00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:26.860
widespread that idea is.

00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:30.642
So what's the densest lattice
in two dimensions again?

00:23:30.642 --> 00:23:35.760
We want to find the densest
lattice, in terms of coding

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:38.700
gain or Hermite's parameter
in n dimensions.

00:23:43.392 --> 00:23:46.230
Anyone care to guess what the
densest lattice in two

00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:49.500
dimensions is?

00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:52.000
It's the hexagonal lattice.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:24:00.660
So in two dimensions, hexagonal,
which reasons of

00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:04.690
mathematical history
is denoted A_2.

00:24:04.690 --> 00:24:12.190
And its coding gain, I believe
we computed it last time, and

00:24:12.190 --> 00:24:13.620
it was 0.6 dB.

00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:25.280
So what's the most we could ever
do by fooling around with

00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:26.810
two-dimensional constellations?

00:24:26.810 --> 00:24:33.040
Suppose I want the best
possible 256 point QAM

00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:35.350
constellation?

00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:39.990
Well, according to these large
constellation approximations,

00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:47.540
the best I could do would be to
take the 256 lowest energy

00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:50.260
points in some translate of
the hexagonal lattice.

00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:53.210
So I might fool around with
the translation vector a

00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:57.960
little bit to try to find the
absolute lowest energy point,

00:24:57.960 --> 00:24:59.580
but it really wouldn't
matter very much

00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:02.020
regardless of what I did.

00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:06.240
I could expect 0.6 dB of coding
gain and 0.2 dB of

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:14.360
shaping gain, or 0.8 dB better
than the 8 by 8 - sorry the 16

00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:19.100
by 16 QAM constellation with the
same number of points and

00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:20.350
the same minimum distance.

00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:28.340
This basically tells you
what your options are.

00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:30.670
2D, there's not much to do.

00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:33.300
You remember way back in Chapter
One, I gave you this

00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:36.060
problem about the 16 point,
2D constellation.

00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:41.690
That is precisely 16 points from
a certain translate of

00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:45.600
the hexagonal lattice that fall
within a circle that's

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:48.370
just big enough to enclose
16 points.

00:25:48.370 --> 00:25:54.810
And it has, I forget, something
like a 0.7 dB gain

00:25:54.810 --> 00:25:59.210
over the 4 by 4 square
constellation.

00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:02.810
We computed that in the
very first homework.

00:26:02.810 --> 00:26:05.840
So again, staying to
two dimensions,

00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:07.120
things aren't very exciting.

00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:13.270
Turns out, it's most
interesting to go

00:26:13.270 --> 00:26:14.710
in powers of two.

00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:21.320
In four dimensions, the densest
lattice is something

00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:26.700
called D4, Schlafly's lattice,
1850-something.

00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:34.260
And its coding gain is precisely
the square root of

00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:36.530
2, which is 1.5 dB.

00:26:42.965 --> 00:26:53.610
8 dimensions, it's E8, Gosset's
lattice, about 1900.

00:26:53.610 --> 00:26:57.660
The D4 and E8 come, again,
from the mathematical

00:26:57.660 --> 00:26:59.800
literature and have something to
do with their relationship

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:02.380
to certain groups.

00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:07.230
Lattices and finite groups are
very closely connected.

00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:12.420
And this has a coding
gain of 2 or 3 dB.

00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:18.100
16 dimensions, it's something
just called lambda 16.

00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:23.010
It's a Barnes-Wall lattice, as
all of these are, actually.

00:27:23.010 --> 00:27:26.630
And it's 2 to the
3/2, or 4.5 dB.

00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:28.380
You see a certain
pattern here?

00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:36.910
In 32 dimensions, we have two
lattices that I'll mention.

00:27:36.910 --> 00:27:43.850
There's the 32-dimensional
Barnes-Wall lattice, which has

00:27:43.850 --> 00:27:45.100
a coding gain of 4.6 dB.

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:54.330
Or there's actually Quebbeman in
the '60s, I think, came up

00:27:54.330 --> 00:27:55.470
with a denser lattice.

00:27:55.470 --> 00:28:00.000
So this is still a subject
of active investigation,

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.760
particularly in dimensions like
19, where it's not so

00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:05.290
easy to find the densest
lattice.

00:28:05.290 --> 00:28:08.555
And this, I forget,
is maybe 6.2 dB.

00:28:08.555 --> 00:28:11.510
It's definitely denser.

00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:12.810
But it's something like that.

00:28:19.930 --> 00:28:22.660
This basically goes
to infinity.

00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:25.340
You can get denser and denser
lattices just by following

00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:28.460
this chain here which is a chain
of Barnes-Wall lattices.

00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:35.920
The nominal coding gain can be
taken to infinity, just as we

00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:41.100
saw with kd over n.

00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:44.570
That goes to infinity for rate
1/2 Reed-Muller codes.

00:28:47.390 --> 00:28:51.870
But of course, Shannon says we
can't ever get more than 9 dB

00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:53.900
of effective coding gain here.

00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:56.810
Or actually, we can't get more
than 7 and a 1/2 dB if we take

00:28:56.810 --> 00:28:59.150
into account that 1 and a 1/2
is going to be given by

00:28:59.150 --> 00:29:01.020
shaping gain.

00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:04.230
So what must be happening
here?

00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:08.200
We must be having a huge number
of near neighbors.

00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:12.250
The number of nearest neighbors
in the hexagonal

00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:14.960
lattice is six.

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:25.830
In D4 it's 24, in E8 it's
240, in lambda 16

00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:27.980
I think it's 4320--

00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:30.840
the correct numbers
are in the notes.

00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:37.100
By the time we get up here, we
get something like a 146,680

00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:39.360
or something like that.

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:44.640
So these lattices are designed
to have a very

00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:46.580
high degree of symmetry.

00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:51.100
That means if you stand on any
point, you look around you,

00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:53.790
they've pushed the neighboring
points as far away

00:29:53.790 --> 00:29:55.710
from you as they can.

00:29:55.710 --> 00:29:58.140
But now there are a great many
of them, so you get a uniform

00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:02.190
sky just filled with points
around you, a number of

00:30:02.190 --> 00:30:05.100
dimensions.

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:10.880
So that's what the problem is
and that means that the

00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:12.250
effective coding gain--

00:30:14.790 --> 00:30:16.630
I again do the calculation.

00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:20.340
I know here we lose
at least two dB.

00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:21.590
This is something like 3.8 dB.

00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:30.030
OK, so the effective coding gain
actually sags and begins

00:30:30.030 --> 00:30:31.760
to top out as you
get out here.

00:30:35.690 --> 00:30:38.060
Maybe nowadays you could think
of implementing a larger

00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:41.930
lattice, but I think this is
the largest anyone has ever

00:30:41.930 --> 00:30:43.850
thought about implementing.

00:30:43.850 --> 00:30:47.900
And what do we get?

00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:49.560
A coding gain of less
than 4 dB --

00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:51.500
an effective coding gain.

00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:57.140
So if you use that,
you'd be, say,

00:30:57.140 --> 00:30:58.870
somewhere around 5 db here.

00:31:01.845 --> 00:31:09.660
We go over 6 dB, but then we go
up by this normalized per

00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:12.470
two dimensions, so
we divide by 16.

00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:20.980
That's still 10,000, which
is still 13 factors of 2,

00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:23.120
which is 2.6 dB.

00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:25.780
You can see where
the problem is.

00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:29.980
So anyway, we get something
that's really this moved way

00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:35.575
up a lot more, and as a result
we get a much steeper curve.

00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:43.480
This method doesn't work up
here, but this might be lambda

00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:47.500
16 or lambda 32.

00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:50.040
And then we can get another 1
and a 1/2 dB of shaping gain.

00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:52.500
So maybe 4 dB, optimistically.

00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:00.990
OK, not really.

00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:06.770
So that's a little
disappointing.

00:32:06.770 --> 00:32:14.130
Just by looking up in the math
textbooks, we don't do very

00:32:14.130 --> 00:32:17.310
striking things.

00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:22.470
I mention in particular the
Barnes-Wall lattices, and if I

00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:27.080
had more time I would develop
them because they're very much

00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:30.100
analogous to the Reed-Muller
codes.

00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:35.060
They are constructed by a u, u
plus v construction in the

00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:36.740
same way as Reed-Muller codes.

00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:41.830
They are length-doubling
constructions that also double

00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:46.480
the distance, just as the
Reed-Muller codes do now

00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:48.580
Euclidian distance.

00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:52.140
But let me just give you the
first couple of sentences in a

00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:57.010
discussion of the Barnes-Wall
lattices, which were only

00:32:57.010 --> 00:32:59.357
discovered in '59, about
the same time as

00:32:59.357 --> 00:33:00.607
the Reed-Muller codes.

00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:06.225
Suppose we take the QAM
grid like this.

00:33:09.770 --> 00:33:13.570
An important observation is that
if we take every other

00:33:13.570 --> 00:33:18.570
point in sort-of checkerboard
fashion, what do we get?

00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:26.990
Imagine it's going to infinity
in both directions.

00:33:31.270 --> 00:33:36.940
So this is a subset of half
the points, basically.

00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:46.490
Half the density, twice the
volume of points that, itself

00:33:46.490 --> 00:33:48.890
is a rotated and scaled version

00:33:48.890 --> 00:33:50.140
of the integer lattice.

00:33:53.150 --> 00:33:55.470
Take the centers on a
checkerboard and they form a

00:33:55.470 --> 00:33:59.660
45 degree rotated and square
root of 2 scaled version of

00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:01.830
the integer lattice.

00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:05.320
If this had minimum squared
distance 1 between points,

00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:07.859
then this has minimum squared
distance 2 between points.

00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:13.639
So we could label the
points red, black,

00:34:13.639 --> 00:34:16.770
red, black, red, black.

00:34:16.770 --> 00:34:21.340
If we did that, the red points
would be a co-set of this

00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:25.020
sub-lattice and the black points
would be a co-set--

00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:26.429
meaning a translate--

00:34:26.429 --> 00:34:29.110
of this sub-lattice.

00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:31.420
So let me write that
as follows.

00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:36.620
If we take Z-squared, it has a
sub-lattice which we call RZ

00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:39.560
squared, r for rotation.

00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:43.690
Rotation by the Hadamard matrix,
1, 1, 1 minus 1.

00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:54.230
If I write d min squared, this
has d min squared at 1, this

00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:58.030
has twice the d min squared.

00:34:58.030 --> 00:35:02.230
So I partition my lattice, or
any translate of this lattice,

00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:06.450
into two co-sets of the
sub-lattice with twice the

00:35:06.450 --> 00:35:08.270
minimum squared distance.

00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:11.880
This is the first steps in what
Ungerboeck called set

00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:14.370
partitioning.

00:35:14.370 --> 00:35:18.840
So it's an obvious way to
partition any QAM-type signal

00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:21.270
set, red and black points.

00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:24.170
Having done that, I
can do it again.

00:35:24.170 --> 00:35:26.190
Alright, do it again,
what do I get?

00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:31.330
So now I'm going to take every
other one of these points,

00:35:31.330 --> 00:35:33.760
which will leave me, say,
these 4 points.

00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:39.410
Let me call these A, A, A, A.
These points might be B, B, B,

00:35:39.410 --> 00:35:41.975
B, the other ones
that I cut out.

00:35:41.975 --> 00:35:52.320
I could call these C, C, C,
C and D, D, D, D. Now I've

00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:59.150
partitioned each of these
subsets into two subsets.

00:35:59.150 --> 00:36:04.140
I've partitioned one into A, B
and the other into C, D, such

00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:06.130
that - what does A look like?

00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:14.800
A is another translate
of a lattice.

00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:18.110
This happens to be Z-squared
scaled by 2.

00:36:18.110 --> 00:36:21.850
It's not rotated, it's just
Z-squared scaled by 2.

00:36:21.850 --> 00:36:24.350
So we get down to 2
times Z-squared.

00:36:24.350 --> 00:36:26.020
And what's its minimum
squared distance?

00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:26.835
AUDIENCE: 4.

00:36:26.835 --> 00:36:28.300
PROFESSOR: 4.

00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:29.705
So I've doubled the
distance again.

00:36:39.010 --> 00:36:41.790
This is an elementary but
important observation.

00:36:41.790 --> 00:36:44.120
I can continually go
through these,

00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:45.840
partitioning into two subsets.

00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:48.910
Every time I do, I double
the distance.

00:36:48.910 --> 00:36:54.270
I get another version of the
integer lattice at a higher

00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:56.550
scale and, perhaps, rotated.

00:36:56.550 --> 00:37:02.410
So if I did it again, I would
get eight subsets with minimum

00:37:02.410 --> 00:37:08.220
squared distance 8 between
points in each subset.

00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:13.510
So it's just a repeated
divide-by-2 scheme.

00:37:13.510 --> 00:37:15.650
All right, now to get the
Barnes-Wall lattices, you

00:37:15.650 --> 00:37:18.290
remember how we got the
Reed-Muller codes.

00:37:18.290 --> 00:37:24.210
We took, say, two codes of
length 2 and we put them

00:37:24.210 --> 00:37:27.570
together with the u, u plus v
construction and we got codes

00:37:27.570 --> 00:37:32.190
of length 4 that had the minimum
square distance of the

00:37:32.190 --> 00:37:36.380
higher distance code, if
we chose them properly.

00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:38.640
That's the same thing
we do here.

00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:45.330
If we put together these two
lattices, if we choose them--

00:37:45.330 --> 00:37:50.390
well, just use the u, u plus v
construction where u is from

00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:55.350
Z-squared and v is
from RZ-squared.

00:37:55.350 --> 00:37:57.290
So in words, that's
what you do.

00:37:57.290 --> 00:37:59.475
If you're interested in
looking it up, look

00:37:59.475 --> 00:38:00.710
it up in the notes.

00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:07.030
What you get is a lattice, D4,
that has normalized density

00:38:07.030 --> 00:38:10.080
halfway between that of
Z-squared and RZ-squared, it

00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:11.340
turns out--

00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:14.340
sort of analogous to the code--
and its minimum square

00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:16.990
distance is 2.

00:38:16.990 --> 00:38:20.190
Or if you put these two
together, you get something

00:38:20.190 --> 00:38:24.635
called RD4, whose minimum
square distance is 4.

00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:32.510
So you get something whose
normalized volume is halfway

00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:35.650
between that of these two
normalized volumes, but it has

00:38:35.650 --> 00:38:39.180
the same minimum distance as
this guy, and that's where you

00:38:39.180 --> 00:38:41.460
get the coding gain from.

00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:44.650
This is denser but still has
the same minimum distance.

00:38:47.730 --> 00:38:51.140
If we do this again, go out to
eight dimensions, we get, it

00:38:51.140 --> 00:38:53.670
turns out, E8.

00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:58.190
And this has minimum
square distance 4.

00:38:58.190 --> 00:39:01.860
But it has the same normalized
volume normalized back to two

00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:05.610
dimensions as this guy, which
only had minimum squared

00:39:05.610 --> 00:39:07.300
distance 2.

00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:10.360
So that's precisely why
this has a nominal

00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:12.150
coding gain of 2.

00:39:12.150 --> 00:39:15.520
We've doubled the minimum
square distance without

00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:18.700
changing its density, normalized
back to two

00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:19.950
dimensions.

00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:25.530
All right, so you get all the
Barnes-Wall lattices just by

00:39:25.530 --> 00:39:26.030
doing this.

00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:28.730
This turns out to be a
sub-lattice of this guy.

00:39:28.730 --> 00:39:32.480
Not surprisingly, just as these
lattices are nested,

00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:35.160
just as the Reed-Muller codes
are nested, so you get a

00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:36.270
similar tableau.

00:39:36.270 --> 00:39:40.800
You get a similar construction
that you can take out to 16

00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:43.190
dimensions, 32 dimensions,
however many

00:39:43.190 --> 00:39:44.660
dimensions you want.

00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:48.410
And every time you do, you
increase the coding gain by a

00:39:48.410 --> 00:39:51.810
factor of square root of 2, so
the coding gain eventually

00:39:51.810 --> 00:39:54.500
gets driven to infinity,
and that's the story on

00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:55.550
Barnes-Wall lattices.

00:39:55.550 --> 00:40:00.410
So similarly to Reed-Muller
codes, these are lattices that

00:40:00.410 --> 00:40:04.440
are the densest known in certain
small dimensions like

00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:06.220
4, 8, and 16.

00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:08.560
We don't know any
denser lattices.

00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:12.270
You start to get up to 32, 64
dimensions, then we do know of

00:40:12.270 --> 00:40:14.000
denser lattices.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.750
But they are not nearly as
nicely structured, and maybe

00:40:16.750 --> 00:40:22.020
these are still the best from
a complexity point of view.

00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:27.090
You can play similar games
on building trellis

00:40:27.090 --> 00:40:29.462
representations of these
lattices, as we did for

00:40:29.462 --> 00:40:29.860
Reed-Muller codes.

00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:33.010
They have similar kinds of
trellises because they're

00:40:33.010 --> 00:40:34.260
based on the same
construction.

00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:39.580
So that's the story of
Barnes-Wall lattices.

00:40:39.580 --> 00:40:44.480
The most famous lattice is the
Leech lattice, which is a

00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:51.000
super-dense lattice
in 24 dimensions.

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.790
It has a coding gain of 6 dB.

00:40:58.630 --> 00:41:04.620
And unfortunately, it has
195,560 near neighbors or

00:41:04.620 --> 00:41:05.870
something like that.

00:41:09.870 --> 00:41:13.990
So you can see, it turns out
it's a very close cousin of

00:41:13.990 --> 00:41:18.160
this 32-dimensional Barnes-Wall
lattice.

00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:29.960
It's related to the 24-12-8
Golay code in the same way as

00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:34.710
the Barnes-Wall lattices are
to the Reed-Muller codes.

00:41:34.710 --> 00:41:37.980
So the fact that the Golay code
is so exceptional can be

00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:41.850
seen just as a projection of
the fact that the Leech

00:41:41.850 --> 00:41:43.470
lattice is so exceptional.

00:41:43.470 --> 00:41:47.440
This somehow has the Golay code
buried in it, if you can

00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:49.660
find it in here.

00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:54.310
And the Leech lattice is
particularly notable not just

00:41:54.310 --> 00:41:57.890
because it has remarkably
high coding gain for its

00:41:57.890 --> 00:42:00.810
dimension-- it's remarkably
dense for its dimension,

00:42:00.810 --> 00:42:03.110
exceptional--

00:42:03.110 --> 00:42:07.400
but also because it has
remarkable symmetries, so it's

00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:11.060
connected to some of the largest
exceptional groups,

00:42:11.060 --> 00:42:13.760
the monster exceptional
groups.

00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:16.950
And it was a key step in the
classification of all finite

00:42:16.950 --> 00:42:23.040
groups to find the symmetry
group of this lattice.

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:27.480
Just a little liberal
arts for you.

00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:29.250
So that's what we can
get with lattices.

00:42:29.250 --> 00:42:32.080
By going out to the Leech
lattice or the Barnes-Wall

00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:35.690
lattice-- this could equally
well be the Leech lattice--

00:42:35.690 --> 00:42:39.540
again, effective coding gain
is only about 4 dB or maybe

00:42:39.540 --> 00:42:42.210
even less because of the
exceptional number of near

00:42:42.210 --> 00:42:43.460
neighbors here.

00:42:48.390 --> 00:42:52.440
To one digit of significance,
that's approximately its

00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:53.690
coding gain.

00:42:56.720 --> 00:43:01.958
So how can we go beyond this?

00:43:01.958 --> 00:43:09.280
As I said already, the next
great breakthrough was trellis

00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:12.495
codes for which Gottfried
Ungerboeck became famous.

00:43:19.490 --> 00:43:24.480
Trellis codes, as I say in the
notes, are basically--

00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:27.200
first of all, Ungerboeck thought
about the problem from

00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:29.450
a Euclidian distance
point of view.

00:43:29.450 --> 00:43:32.860
So what you had to do
to break out of

00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:34.822
Hamming distance thinking.

00:43:34.822 --> 00:43:37.490
He had the idea that in the
bandwidth-limited regime, what

00:43:37.490 --> 00:43:40.000
you want to do is expand the
constellation rather than

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:41.730
expand the bandwidth.

00:43:41.730 --> 00:43:48.690
So to send four bits per
second per Hertz.

00:43:48.690 --> 00:43:54.740
You could do that using uncoded
16-QAM constellation.

00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:59.350
Or Ungerboeck saw, well, let's
make it into a 32-point

00:43:59.350 --> 00:44:00.430
constellation.

00:44:00.430 --> 00:44:03.970
Now we have some redundancy, now
we can do some coding on

00:44:03.970 --> 00:44:05.220
this constellation.

00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:11.760
He used the set partitioning
idea, which I've just

00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:14.360
explained to you.

00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:18.200
Initially, he just looked at a
QAM constellation and he said,

00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:27.960
let's divide it up into A, B, A,
B, C, D, C, D, A, B, A, B,

00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:37.350
C, D, C, D. So let's partition
it from A, B, C, D into A and

00:44:37.350 --> 00:44:41.870
D as I've done it here, and B
and C are these two subsets.

00:44:41.870 --> 00:44:48.320
And we'll break this up into A
and D and B and C. And then

00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:51.340
some theoretical people came
along and said, well, this is

00:44:51.340 --> 00:44:54.810
just Z-squared, this is
RZ-squared, and this is

00:44:54.810 --> 00:44:56.060
2Z-squared.

00:45:01.330 --> 00:45:04.386
Let's, first of all, partition
our enlarged constellation.

00:45:07.100 --> 00:45:08.905
Now here's the setup we're
going to use for coding.

00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:15.240
We are going to bring in our
...If we're trying to send--

00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:20.120
I forget what notation I used in
the notes-- b bits per two

00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:21.370
dimensions.

00:45:28.570 --> 00:45:31.250
Let's take one bit per two
dimensions and put it into a

00:45:31.250 --> 00:45:32.740
rate 1/2 convolutional code.

00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:38.010
So we're going to get
out two bits.

00:45:41.450 --> 00:45:44.130
Everything here is going to be
per two dimensions because

00:45:44.130 --> 00:45:46.610
we're going to use a
two-dimensional signal set.

00:45:46.610 --> 00:45:50.420
And we'll bring in our other
b minus 1 bits down here.

00:45:50.420 --> 00:45:51.890
These are called uncoded bits.

00:45:55.770 --> 00:45:58.370
For these two bits,
we're going to go

00:45:58.370 --> 00:46:00.295
into a subset selector.

00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:07.040
Two bits are going
to select among--

00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:12.855
this going to be something from
A, B, C, or D. It's going

00:46:12.855 --> 00:46:14.725
to tell us which
subset to use.

00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:23.710
All right, then we'll use that
in combination with these b

00:46:23.710 --> 00:46:37.990
minus 1 bits to select a point
from a 2 to the b plus 1 bit

00:46:37.990 --> 00:46:39.240
QAM constellation.

00:46:41.530 --> 00:46:42.750
Two dimensions.

00:46:42.750 --> 00:46:47.650
So this is actually our signal
point y, our two-dimensional

00:46:47.650 --> 00:46:50.220
signal point.

00:46:50.220 --> 00:46:54.590
Do you see how the
numbers work out?

00:46:54.590 --> 00:47:00.280
We want to send b bits per QAM
point, per two dimensions.

00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:06.410
We're going to use a 2 to the b
plus 1 point constellation,

00:47:06.410 --> 00:47:08.050
so 32 instead of 16, say.

00:47:10.890 --> 00:47:20.280
Take one bit in here, generate
two streams, one redundant.

00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:24.120
This will tell us A, B, C, D, so
that's two of the bits you

00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:25.930
need to select one
of these points.

00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:34.640
Say, in a 16-point
constellation, we'll provide a

00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:36.080
bit label that looks
like this.

00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:41.220
For A, it will be 0, 0. b is
0, 1, c is 1, 0, D is 1, 1.

00:47:41.220 --> 00:47:44.530
That's always the low-order bits
in any selection for A,

00:47:44.530 --> 00:47:48.220
B, C, D. And then we'll take
two high-order bits, which

00:47:48.220 --> 00:47:51.950
then tell us which of these
four groups it's in.

00:47:51.950 --> 00:47:56.470
So we'll have another 0,
0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1.

00:47:59.140 --> 00:48:02.000
Now I'm talking about
b equals 3.

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:05.360
We have two bits that come in
here and select one of these

00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:09.690
blocks, and then two bits that
come out of here and select A,

00:48:09.690 --> 00:48:13.380
B, C, D within the block.

00:48:13.380 --> 00:48:15.330
There's two parts
to the label.

00:48:15.330 --> 00:48:17.900
One of them determines A, B,
C, D, the other one just

00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:20.880
determines some larger group.

00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:29.910
These bits are called uncoded
because there's no protection.

00:48:29.910 --> 00:48:37.370
If you sent point A over here
and received point A over

00:48:37.370 --> 00:48:39.980
here, that would look
like a perfectly

00:48:39.980 --> 00:48:42.250
legitimate code word.

00:48:42.250 --> 00:48:48.490
If we make an error of that far,
which is d min squared

00:48:48.490 --> 00:48:50.740
equals 4, say.

00:48:50.740 --> 00:48:56.300
We make an error of size d min
equal 2 all the way over here,

00:48:56.300 --> 00:49:00.230
then there's no further
protection from this code

00:49:00.230 --> 00:49:02.670
because this code only
determines the sequence of As,

00:49:02.670 --> 00:49:03.920
Bs, Cs, and Ds.

00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:11.880
This is called a within-subset
error.

00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:16.380
There's no protection on
within subset errors.

00:49:16.380 --> 00:49:19.490
What the code does is it
protects against smaller

00:49:19.490 --> 00:49:26.840
errors that are between subset
errors like A to B, which has

00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:30.890
squared distance of 1 or A to
D has a squared distance of

00:49:30.890 --> 00:49:32.380
two, and so forth.

00:49:39.250 --> 00:49:40.640
Are you with me?

00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:41.920
Nobody's asking questions.

00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:43.170
Maybe I haven't permitted it.

00:49:48.550 --> 00:49:53.140
Do you follow what the
overall setup is?

00:49:53.140 --> 00:49:57.880
I've done everything now,
except choose an exact

00:49:57.880 --> 00:49:58.790
constellation.

00:49:58.790 --> 00:50:03.500
For the exact constellation,
I'll just choose one of the

00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:05.110
best QAM signal sets.

00:50:05.110 --> 00:50:08.590
If it's large enough, I'll
shape it like a circle.

00:50:08.590 --> 00:50:13.860
Or I might even try to put
Gaussian shaping on it by some

00:50:13.860 --> 00:50:15.900
completely extraneous
thing that works

00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:17.175
only on these clumps.

00:50:19.750 --> 00:50:24.450
So shaping takes place on
the higher order bits.

00:50:24.450 --> 00:50:27.630
You can see that, given a large
enough constellation

00:50:27.630 --> 00:50:31.340
just by choosing these clumps,
I can make the constellation

00:50:31.340 --> 00:50:33.085
sort of have the shape
of a circle.

00:50:42.535 --> 00:50:45.950
The subsets of A, B, C, and D
points have to all be the same

00:50:45.950 --> 00:50:48.460
size in order for this
scheme to work.

00:50:48.460 --> 00:50:50.630
But I can do that within a sort
of circular constellation

00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:53.250
if the constellation
is large enough.

00:50:53.250 --> 00:50:58.650
Or I can put some Gaussian
distribution on these clumps.

00:50:58.650 --> 00:51:00.340
So I do shaping down here.

00:51:03.490 --> 00:51:05.140
Initially, of course,
Ungerboeck

00:51:05.140 --> 00:51:06.190
didn't worry about shaping.

00:51:06.190 --> 00:51:10.940
But if I try to do shaping, it's
down on this index, which

00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:14.440
is considered to be the higher
order bits that determine the

00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:16.950
growth structure of
the constellation.

00:51:16.950 --> 00:51:20.030
These are the lower order bits,
these two bits, and they

00:51:20.030 --> 00:51:22.250
determine the fine structure
which is

00:51:22.250 --> 00:51:23.680
determined by this code.

00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:28.580
So the last thing I have to
select is the code, and it

00:51:28.580 --> 00:51:33.260
turns out that the same code
we used in the example is a

00:51:33.260 --> 00:51:34.530
good code to use here.

00:51:34.530 --> 00:51:42.290
Suppose we use the four-state
rate 1/2 example code that

00:51:42.290 --> 00:51:51.290
I've used before that is
everybody's favorite example

00:51:51.290 --> 00:51:56.010
because it has such excellent
distance properties.

00:51:56.010 --> 00:51:57.680
So it looks like this.

00:52:00.290 --> 00:52:02.740
So that's my rate 1/2 encoder.

00:52:06.090 --> 00:52:12.660
You remember as a binary code,
it had minimum Hamming

00:52:12.660 --> 00:52:14.020
distance 5.

00:52:14.020 --> 00:52:17.800
And the only minimum
distance code word

00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:21.430
was the impulse response.

00:52:21.430 --> 00:52:23.290
Let me write the impulse
response as this

00:52:23.290 --> 00:52:24.540
way: 11, 01, 11.

00:52:26.380 --> 00:52:30.200
This is what we get out at time
0, time 1, and time 2.

00:52:38.510 --> 00:52:42.340
Let me assign the following
labels to these subsets.

00:52:42.340 --> 00:52:46.370
We'll make that 00, this
one 11, this one 01,

00:52:46.370 --> 00:52:47.620
and that one 10.

00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:53.185
In other words, this is the
complement of that.

00:52:53.185 --> 00:52:54.545
This is the complement
of that.

00:53:05.690 --> 00:53:10.680
What is the nearest neighbor
point in Euclidian space for

00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:13.300
this sequence?

00:53:13.300 --> 00:53:16.080
If I complement the first two
bits coming out, then I'm

00:53:16.080 --> 00:53:24.020
going to go from one of these
subsets to another, but within

00:53:24.020 --> 00:53:27.590
one of these RZ-squared subsets,
which has minimum

00:53:27.590 --> 00:53:30.650
squared distance 2.

00:53:30.650 --> 00:53:33.460
So let's remind ourselves that
the minimum squared distance

00:53:33.460 --> 00:53:38.480
within A, B, C, D is 1, within
A, D or B, C is 2, within

00:53:38.480 --> 00:53:42.470
2Z-squared is 4.

00:53:42.470 --> 00:53:43.920
So I'm claiming--

00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:47.200
there's actually a problem on
this on Problem Set 10 if you

00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:49.900
tried to do it--

00:53:49.900 --> 00:54:00.780
that any error of this type,
11, is going to cause me a

00:54:00.780 --> 00:54:05.620
Euclidian error of minimum
squared distance 2, at least.

00:54:05.620 --> 00:54:09.830
It can only cause me to go from
A to D, which is always

00:54:09.830 --> 00:54:15.850
at least squared distance 2, or
from B to C, or vice versa.

00:54:15.850 --> 00:54:20.720
So in terms of Euclidian
distance, d min squared, I'm

00:54:20.720 --> 00:54:25.200
always going to get a squared
distance of 2 at this point.

00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:28.200
And actually, any place you
diverged in the trellis,

00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:29.810
because of the structure
of the code, this

00:54:29.810 --> 00:54:32.210
is going to be true.

00:54:32.210 --> 00:54:37.800
I'm always going to get a
squared distance of 2 when two

00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:42.110
trellis paths come together
in the trellis.

00:54:42.110 --> 00:54:45.770
I always have a binary
difference of 11, so by the

00:54:45.770 --> 00:54:48.140
same argument I'm always going
to get a Euclidian squared

00:54:48.140 --> 00:54:52.250
distance of 2 when two trellis
paths come together.

00:54:52.250 --> 00:54:55.070
And furthermore, I'm going to
have at least one difference

00:54:55.070 --> 00:54:58.790
somewhere in between, which is
going to, again, in terms of

00:54:58.790 --> 00:55:00.730
Euclidian distance, lead
to a Euclidian

00:55:00.730 --> 00:55:05.250
distance of at least 1.

00:55:05.250 --> 00:55:12.080
So the conclusion is that
between any two sequences of

00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:16.920
constellation points that are
labeled by two distinct code

00:55:16.920 --> 00:55:21.720
words here, I'm going to have a
cumulative Euclidian squared

00:55:21.720 --> 00:55:25.520
distance of at least 5, by the
same argument as I had for the

00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:26.440
binary code.

00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:32.740
But now it turns out that I'm
still in a regime where binary

00:55:32.740 --> 00:55:37.140
distance, Hamming distance
translates directly to

00:55:37.140 --> 00:55:38.450
Euclidian distance.

00:55:38.450 --> 00:55:41.370
This is what you saw.

00:55:41.370 --> 00:55:44.760
Basically, what we're using here
is this is Z-squared, you

00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:49.420
can think of as the image of
the (2, 2) binary code.

00:55:49.420 --> 00:55:54.360
RZ-squared is the image of the
(2, 1) binary code, and this

00:55:54.360 --> 00:55:58.330
2Z-squared is the image of
the (2, 0) binary code.

00:55:58.330 --> 00:56:02.370
You get the same partition
structure for these codes and

00:56:02.370 --> 00:56:04.390
their co-sets.

00:56:04.390 --> 00:56:07.830
This is the set of all
four two-tuples.

00:56:07.830 --> 00:56:10.050
We divided it into two subsets,
each of minimum

00:56:10.050 --> 00:56:13.530
distance 2 here, and here we
divide it into four subsets,

00:56:13.530 --> 00:56:14.785
each of minimum distance
infinity.

00:56:17.330 --> 00:56:21.240
I'm not going to take the time
to make this precise, but

00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:24.540
think of how that
relation goes.

00:56:24.540 --> 00:56:28.200
So I've assured myself of a
Euclidian squared distance at

00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:32.300
least 5 between signal point
sequences that correspond to

00:56:32.300 --> 00:56:33.550
two different code words.

00:56:35.900 --> 00:56:37.890
That's excellent.

00:56:37.890 --> 00:56:39.910
Is the minimum squared distance
of the code then

00:56:39.910 --> 00:56:43.190
equal to 5, as it was in
the binary case of

00:56:43.190 --> 00:56:44.400
this trellis code?

00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:46.200
No, it's not.

00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:49.910
And the problem is I could make
this kind of error, which

00:56:49.910 --> 00:56:52.660
is completely invisible
to the code.

00:56:52.660 --> 00:56:55.470
I can make a within subset
error, and this only has

00:56:55.470 --> 00:56:59.220
minimum square distance of 4.

00:56:59.220 --> 00:57:04.500
So the conclusion of this
analysis is that this is

00:57:04.500 --> 00:57:08.930
what's called a four-state
two-dimensional trellis code.

00:57:08.930 --> 00:57:11.620
This four-state two-dimensional
trellis code

00:57:11.620 --> 00:57:15.430
has a minimum squared distance
of 4, and it has a number of

00:57:15.430 --> 00:57:18.430
nearest neighbors per
two dimension of 4.

00:57:18.430 --> 00:57:21.600
That's the number of nearest
neighbors within 2Z-squared,

00:57:21.600 --> 00:57:25.320
which is one of these subsets.

00:57:25.320 --> 00:57:30.580
So the conclusion is that
already, this has a legitimate

00:57:30.580 --> 00:57:32.300
3 dB coding gain.

00:57:32.300 --> 00:57:37.020
Its coefficient is still just
the QAM coefficient, and this

00:57:37.020 --> 00:57:42.170
very simple code has this
performance curve moved over.

00:57:46.490 --> 00:57:48.695
So it's 3 dB all the
way up the line.

00:57:52.440 --> 00:57:54.600
So that's pretty good.

00:57:54.600 --> 00:57:57.800
This is a trivial code that
could be decoding--

00:57:57.800 --> 00:58:00.120
by the way, it was, again, done
by the Viterbi algorithm

00:58:00.120 --> 00:58:02.960
of a four-state trellis.

00:58:02.960 --> 00:58:09.380
You just take the sequences
and it's exactly the same.

00:58:09.380 --> 00:58:14.960
You measure distance in terms
of minimum squared distance.

00:58:14.960 --> 00:58:25.640
The only difference is when
you decode, you first find

00:58:25.640 --> 00:58:27.520
what the closest point
is within the

00:58:27.520 --> 00:58:30.500
A, B, C and D subsets.

00:58:30.500 --> 00:58:32.910
That is what you're going to
take as your representative

00:58:32.910 --> 00:58:33.920
for that subset.

00:58:33.920 --> 00:58:38.250
So you first make basically an
uncoded decision, which is the

00:58:38.250 --> 00:58:39.190
closest point in A?

00:58:39.190 --> 00:58:41.750
Which is the closest point in B,
which is the closest point

00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:45.090
in C, which is the closest
point in D?

00:58:45.090 --> 00:58:46.750
You're going to get a metric
for each of those.

00:58:46.750 --> 00:58:49.470
How far is each of those
from the receive point?

00:58:49.470 --> 00:58:52.810
So then in trellis decoding,
what the trellis is going to

00:58:52.810 --> 00:58:55.880
look like is something
like this.

00:58:55.880 --> 00:59:03.380
A, D, A, D, B, C,
and so forth.

00:59:09.490 --> 00:59:13.860
The trellis is going to look
exactly the same, but here you

00:59:13.860 --> 00:59:18.840
get A, D, D, A, B, C, C, B.

00:59:18.840 --> 00:59:21.290
So what metric are we
going to use for

00:59:21.290 --> 00:59:25.090
each of these branches?

00:59:25.090 --> 00:59:28.210
First, we find the closest point
within each subset, and

00:59:28.210 --> 00:59:30.670
then we use the metric
for that point.

00:59:30.670 --> 00:59:34.540
Clearly, if we're going to
choose A for this time

00:59:34.540 --> 00:59:40.020
interval, then we should use the
closest point in A as our

00:59:40.020 --> 00:59:41.980
receive decision.

00:59:41.980 --> 00:59:46.380
We can get that survivor without
any memory whatsoever

00:59:46.380 --> 00:59:51.630
when we make that decision, and
then we take the sequences

00:59:51.630 --> 00:59:55.180
of representatives and find
the best of those

00:59:55.180 --> 00:59:57.570
representatives as our best
trellis-coded sequence.

01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:03.830
Any sequence of points that has
labels that correspond to

01:00:03.830 --> 01:00:06.210
some path through this
trellis is a valid

01:00:06.210 --> 01:00:07.560
point and vice versa.

01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:10.660
If and only if the sequence of
labels is according to this

01:00:10.660 --> 01:00:15.920
trellis is it a legitimate
trellis-coded point.

01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:17.170
So it's a nice amalgamation.

01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:23.220
Great.

01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:27.580
With a simple four-state code,
basically we've doubled the

01:00:27.580 --> 01:00:28.920
size the constellation.

01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:32.850
The constellation expansion is
2, the constellation expansion

01:00:32.850 --> 01:00:36.230
factor with twice as large a
constellation, we've been able

01:00:36.230 --> 01:00:40.420
to achieve a coding
gain of 3 dB.

01:00:40.420 --> 01:00:43.110
Not bad.

01:00:43.110 --> 01:00:46.730
So how do we extend this idea?

01:00:46.730 --> 01:00:50.710
First, extension would be to--

01:00:50.710 --> 01:00:53.060
all right, let's go up
to an 8 state, 16

01:00:53.060 --> 01:00:54.340
state, whatever code.

01:00:54.340 --> 01:00:56.960
But is that going to improve
our minimum distance using

01:00:56.960 --> 01:01:00.310
this block diagram?

01:01:00.310 --> 01:01:02.710
It's not, because we're
still stuck with this

01:01:02.710 --> 01:01:03.950
within subset distance.

01:01:03.950 --> 01:01:08.550
So we can never get past d min
squared equals 4 with a

01:01:08.550 --> 01:01:10.920
four-way partition.

01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:13.490
What we have to do is make one
more level of partition and we

01:01:13.490 --> 01:01:16.830
need to make an eight way
partition, at which point

01:01:16.830 --> 01:01:19.280
we're going to get a within
subset distance of 8.

01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:31.810
I left out one step,
I'm sorry.

01:01:31.810 --> 01:01:33.060
I'll come back to it.

01:01:36.130 --> 01:01:40.520
We can get a code minimum
squared distance up to 8, if

01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:43.260
we extend the minimum squared
distance up to 8.

01:01:43.260 --> 01:01:47.830
The thing I didn't use, I didn't
tell you before, was in

01:01:47.830 --> 01:01:51.570
computing the coding
gain of this code--

01:01:51.570 --> 01:01:54.190
let's just call it c--

01:01:54.190 --> 01:01:55.100
what should it be?

01:01:55.100 --> 01:01:57.950
It should be the minimum squared
distance of the code

01:01:57.950 --> 01:02:01.970
over the volume of the code
per two dimensions.

01:02:01.970 --> 01:02:04.990
In this case, n is 2 so I'm just
going to do it over the

01:02:04.990 --> 01:02:06.310
volume of the code.

01:02:06.310 --> 01:02:10.420
Now what is the volume of
a convolutional code?

01:02:10.420 --> 01:02:17.030
This is actually an interesting
problem, because

01:02:17.030 --> 01:02:20.480
the Voronoi region of a trellis
code is actually an

01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:23.030
infinite dimensional object.

01:02:23.030 --> 01:02:25.400
A trellis code is really an
infinite dimensional lattice.

01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:28.490
It's a lattice in infinite
dimensional space.

01:02:28.490 --> 01:02:33.040
And if you look at the Voronoi
region, it extends out into

01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:34.820
all these dimensions.

01:02:34.820 --> 01:02:36.890
It might not for such a
simple code, but in

01:02:36.890 --> 01:02:39.930
principle it does.

01:02:39.930 --> 01:02:42.590
However, you can find other
fundamental regions.

01:02:42.590 --> 01:02:47.040
The way to think about
this is instead of

01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:50.040
putting the volume here--

01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:52.840
well, what have we cost
ourselves in volume?

01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:55.650
We've doubled the size
of the constellation.

01:02:55.650 --> 01:02:57.580
And in two dimensions,
that means

01:02:57.580 --> 01:02:58.830
we've doubled the volume.

01:03:02.510 --> 01:03:05.910
So we've quadrupled the minimum
distance at the cost

01:03:05.910 --> 01:03:10.230
of doubling the volume.

01:03:10.230 --> 01:03:13.160
We've covered twice as much
space now because we have

01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:15.610
twice as many points.

01:03:15.610 --> 01:03:18.050
And so, that's where
we get the--

01:03:18.050 --> 01:03:21.710
this is equal to, for
this code, that's 4.

01:03:21.710 --> 01:03:25.750
We have a factor of 2 loss in
volume, and so that's where we

01:03:25.750 --> 01:03:29.795
get what I said was a coding
gain of 2 or 3 dB.

01:03:34.270 --> 01:03:37.280
Just to get you to the bottom
line, we should replace the

01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:40.230
volume by two times--

01:03:40.230 --> 01:03:44.720
I call it eta of the code--
where eta of the code is its

01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:51.620
redundancy per two dimensions.

01:03:51.620 --> 01:03:54.390
In this case, we introduce
one redundant bit per two

01:03:54.390 --> 01:03:57.400
dimensions, and that's why the
constellation has to expand by

01:03:57.400 --> 01:03:59.970
a factor of 2.

01:03:59.970 --> 01:04:03.840
You see, we get the
right answer.

01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:08.050
The redundancy has increased by
one bit, so this has to be

01:04:08.050 --> 01:04:10.790
2 to the b plus 1, so the
constellation has to be twice

01:04:10.790 --> 01:04:14.220
as large, so the volume
is twice as large.

01:04:14.220 --> 01:04:17.360
I'll just hand-wave and tell you
that's the factor you want

01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:19.670
down here representing
volume --

01:04:19.670 --> 01:04:21.680
2 to the redundancy.

01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:27.992
And you can prove this by
finding a region which you can

01:04:27.992 --> 01:04:30.870
show is a fundamental region
of the trellis code and has

01:04:30.870 --> 01:04:32.030
this volume.

01:04:32.030 --> 01:04:35.730
But I won't go into that.

01:04:35.730 --> 01:04:39.000
OK, so that's the calculation
which I should've mentioned

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.090
before, I skipped
right over it.

01:04:41.090 --> 01:04:42.220
Back to what I was saying.

01:04:42.220 --> 01:04:46.450
To improve trellis codes, the
first thing you can do is to,

01:04:46.450 --> 01:04:49.760
say, go to an eight-way
partition.

01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:53.270
So now we're going to
have eight subsets.

01:04:53.270 --> 01:04:56.140
So we're going to need
three bits here.

01:04:56.140 --> 01:05:01.180
So let's use two bits here and
use a rate 2/3 trellis code.

01:05:01.180 --> 01:05:04.450
We're going to have three bits
coming out here to select

01:05:04.450 --> 01:05:08.610
subsets, and we're going to have
b minus 2 bits down here

01:05:08.610 --> 01:05:14.620
to select a point still
a 2b plus 1 point QAM

01:05:14.620 --> 01:05:16.060
constellation.

01:05:16.060 --> 01:05:19.220
So our redundancy per two
dimensions is still one bit

01:05:19.220 --> 01:05:20.120
per two dimensions.

01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:23.540
We're still going to lose a
factor of 2, but now we can go

01:05:23.540 --> 01:05:27.570
up to d min squared equals 8 and
we can go up to a coding

01:05:27.570 --> 01:05:29.690
gain of 6 dB.

01:05:29.690 --> 01:05:33.910
So in his original paper,
Ungerboeck did this.

01:05:33.910 --> 01:05:39.860
He showed codes going up to 256
states in two dimensions

01:05:39.860 --> 01:05:44.320
that gets you up to a nominal
6 dB coding gain.

01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:48.390
And because they have low
coefficients here, they get

01:05:48.390 --> 01:05:51.350
very close to 6 dB of effective
coding gain.

01:05:54.610 --> 01:05:59.050
Already in Ungerboeck,
we have codes--

01:05:59.050 --> 01:06:03.510
I mean, eventually you can get
back to just the within-subset

01:06:03.510 --> 01:06:07.930
coefficient again, which
is always 4.

01:06:07.930 --> 01:06:14.860
You can get up to, say, 6 dB
with maybe 512 states of

01:06:14.860 --> 01:06:21.160
effective coding gain, which
is considerably better than

01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:27.250
the densest lattice we would
think of using, and also quite

01:06:27.250 --> 01:06:28.220
reasonable to implement.

01:06:28.220 --> 01:06:31.500
Now we're going to need
a 256, 512-state

01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:33.250
Viterbi algorithm decoder.

01:06:38.510 --> 01:06:43.040
This was a stunning
breakthrough.

01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:48.360
Immediately in 1993, everybody
started building turbo codes.

01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:50.360
Back in 1982, everybody started

01:06:50.360 --> 01:06:51.970
building trellis codes.

01:06:51.970 --> 01:06:56.820
It happened to be the time of
the V.32 modem, and everybody

01:06:56.820 --> 01:07:00.680
said boy, this is just what we
need to get an additional 3 or

01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:04.115
4 dB coding gain in
the V.32 modem.

01:07:04.115 --> 01:07:07.680
What was actually done there
is this was simply an

01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:13.690
eight-state convolutional code,
so it was rate 2/3.

01:07:13.690 --> 01:07:15.230
And there was tweaking
of this.

01:07:15.230 --> 01:07:19.810
It was made rotationally
invariant, made nonlinear.

01:07:19.810 --> 01:07:23.840
And a lot of activity, which was
very nice, stimulated by

01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:25.130
the standards effort.

01:07:25.130 --> 01:07:27.640
But that was basically the state
of the art in the '80s.

01:07:30.270 --> 01:07:36.070
The one other improvement
that was made was

01:07:36.070 --> 01:07:38.650
the following idea.

01:07:38.650 --> 01:07:41.610
We really don't like doubling
the size of the constellation,

01:07:41.610 --> 01:07:45.060
particularly for a large
one, mostly for

01:07:45.060 --> 01:07:48.160
implementation reasons.

01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:51.460
There were some feelings against
nonlinearities a

01:07:51.460 --> 01:07:53.920
larger constellation
would cost you.

01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:58.190
You wanted to minimize the
constellation expansion ratio.

01:07:58.190 --> 01:08:02.730
So how were we ever
going to do that?

01:08:02.730 --> 01:08:06.610
You can't do it this way
in two dimensions.

01:08:06.610 --> 01:08:09.255
The way to do that is to go
up to four dimensions.

01:08:12.270 --> 01:08:15.140
So let's do subset partitioning
in four

01:08:15.140 --> 01:08:16.390
dimensions.

01:08:18.270 --> 01:08:20.760
So now think of four dimensional
constellations.

01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:24.270
In practice, these are just
built from the Cartesian

01:08:24.270 --> 01:08:27.790
product of two two-dimensional
constellations.

01:08:27.790 --> 01:08:29.830
We start with Z4.

01:08:29.830 --> 01:08:32.939
The next one down is D4,
which has a minimum

01:08:32.939 --> 01:08:34.079
square distance of 2.

01:08:34.079 --> 01:08:37.390
It's sometimes called a
checkerboard constellation in

01:08:37.390 --> 01:08:38.180
four dimensions.

01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:41.729
It's just the red-black
idea again.

01:08:41.729 --> 01:08:46.010
Then below that, we have a
four-way partition into RZ4,

01:08:46.010 --> 01:08:51.300
which still has minimum
distance 2.

01:08:51.300 --> 01:08:56.279
And one more level of
partitioning here into

01:08:56.279 --> 01:09:02.559
something into RD4, which has
minimum squared distance of 4.

01:09:06.950 --> 01:09:10.160
So this is an eight-way
partition of a

01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:11.930
four-dimensional
constellation.

01:09:11.930 --> 01:09:14.189
This idea was introduced
by Lee-Fang Wei.

01:09:17.290 --> 01:09:22.140
Again, this is an interesting
column over here.

01:09:22.140 --> 01:09:25.200
You can think of this as being
the (4, 4, 1) code.

01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:30.376
This is the Euclidian image
of the (4, 3, 2) code.

01:09:30.376 --> 01:09:32.930
It kind of expanded
in the lattice.

01:09:32.930 --> 01:09:35.870
We know we can't do any
better than (4, 2, 2).

01:09:35.870 --> 01:09:39.120
Down here, this is the
(4, 1, 4) code.

01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:42.870
So again, this is the same
partition as we get for binary

01:09:42.870 --> 01:09:44.993
codes with the distances--

01:09:47.810 --> 01:09:52.609
again, for binary codes and this
level of partitioning,

01:09:52.609 --> 01:09:56.440
Hamming distance translates
to Euclidian distance.

01:09:56.440 --> 01:10:01.480
It's really just the image of
these codes as you go up to

01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:02.730
the lattices.

01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:10.220
Now in this case, what's the
best we can ever do?

01:10:10.220 --> 01:10:10.910
Coding gain.

01:10:10.910 --> 01:10:16.800
We still can't go up to a
squared distance of greater

01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:22.830
than 4 because our within-subset
distance is

01:10:22.830 --> 01:10:25.410
going to be within RD4.

01:10:25.410 --> 01:10:28.240
So this is still limited to 4.

01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:31.850
But now, what's our redundancy
per two dimensions?

01:10:31.850 --> 01:10:37.210
Here, say, we're going to
use still a rate 2/3

01:10:37.210 --> 01:10:38.490
convolutional code.

01:10:38.490 --> 01:10:42.570
We'll now have an eight-subset
selector in 4D, so everything

01:10:42.570 --> 01:10:45.800
is per 4D here.

01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:55.380
So this is going to be 2b minus
two bits and this is

01:10:55.380 --> 01:11:00.450
going to be, it turns out, a
constellation that is twice as

01:11:00.450 --> 01:11:02.010
large in four dimensions.

01:11:02.010 --> 01:11:05.260
We still have one redundant bit
per four dimensions, so we

01:11:05.260 --> 01:11:08.050
need twice the size of the
constellation in four

01:11:08.050 --> 01:11:09.660
dimensions.

01:11:09.660 --> 01:11:14.670
But that's only 1/2 a bit of
redundancy per two dimensions.

01:11:14.670 --> 01:11:18.620
So this denominator becomes
2 to the 1/2.

01:11:18.620 --> 01:11:21.940
Waving hands furiously here.

01:11:21.940 --> 01:11:26.990
And so this could go up to 2 to
the 3/2, which is 4.5 dB.

01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:35.800
So there's actually a
particularly nice eight-state

01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:41.620
code here that Wei came up with
which, really, in terms

01:11:41.620 --> 01:11:45.530
of performance versus complexity
is the only code

01:11:45.530 --> 01:11:48.510
that anyone has ever come up
with that is distinctly better

01:11:48.510 --> 01:11:50.855
than any of Ungerboeck's
original codes.

01:11:50.855 --> 01:11:54.040
All of Ungerboeck's original
codes were in one dimension,

01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:56.280
two dimensions, or PSK codes.

01:11:56.280 --> 01:11:58.870
You could also do this
on phase shift key

01:11:58.870 --> 01:12:00.120
constellations.

01:12:02.140 --> 01:12:09.260
So with the Wei code, it gives
you a very simple way

01:12:09.260 --> 01:12:10.840
to get 4 1/2 dB.

01:12:13.750 --> 01:12:18.770
Actually, you have to go up to
16 states to get 4 1/2 dB.

01:12:18.770 --> 01:12:21.290
The Wei code is only 4.2 dB.

01:12:21.290 --> 01:12:24.900
And this is basically what was
adopted for standards in the

01:12:24.900 --> 01:12:25.810
early '90s.

01:12:25.810 --> 01:12:33.470
The V.34 modem standard, also
the ADSL standard has the same

01:12:33.470 --> 01:12:34.020
code in it.

01:12:34.020 --> 01:12:38.230
If you have DSL at home, that's
what it's using in it.

01:12:38.230 --> 01:12:43.460
Again, with a very simple code,
the eight-state Viterbi

01:12:43.460 --> 01:12:47.680
algorithm, you can get 4.2
dB of coding gain.

01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:53.530
The error coefficient in this
case, this has 24 nearest

01:12:53.530 --> 01:12:57.110
neighbors in D4, or 12
per two dimensions.

01:12:57.110 --> 01:13:05.460
So you lose 0.15 dB
or something.

01:13:05.460 --> 01:13:06.735
I'm sorry, 0.3 dB.

01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:14.860
Anyway, this is a
very nice code.

01:13:21.460 --> 01:13:24.640
There are 32 and 64-state
codes in V.34.

01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:26.610
They don't gain you very much.

01:13:26.610 --> 01:13:29.820
They each double the complexity
and only gain you

01:13:29.820 --> 01:13:33.710
about 0.2 dB for each one.

01:13:33.710 --> 01:13:35.430
All these things tend
to saturate.

01:13:35.430 --> 01:13:39.760
You can't get more than about 5
to 6 dB of coding gain with

01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:41.700
a reasonable size
trellis code.

01:13:45.790 --> 01:13:48.500
So where are we now?

01:13:48.500 --> 01:13:55.610
We can get 5 or 6 dB of coding
gain with, say, a 256-state

01:13:55.610 --> 01:13:57.420
trellis code.

01:13:57.420 --> 01:14:03.360
We can get another 1 to 1 and
a 1/2 dB of shaping gain.

01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:09.590
So all together, we're
up to 6 to 7.5 dB.

01:14:09.590 --> 01:14:15.580
From here, we're up somewhere
into the 2 to 3 dB range.

01:14:15.580 --> 01:14:23.980
In other words, combining
trellis code with, say, 256

01:14:23.980 --> 01:14:33.300
states with some shaping scheme
with maybe 1 dB of

01:14:33.300 --> 01:14:41.520
shaping gain, this gets you
maybe 5 dB or 5.5 dB.

01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:51.870
We get 6 dB total effective
gain, and we're still 3 dB or

01:14:51.870 --> 01:14:55.140
maybe 2 or 3 dB from
Shannon limit.

01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:09.840
So, close but not
quite there yet.

01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:13.250
Five minutes to go.

01:15:13.250 --> 01:15:16.210
So in the notes, there's
one page on

01:15:16.210 --> 01:15:17.590
higher performance schemes.

01:15:17.590 --> 01:15:20.340
There are higher performance
schemes.

01:15:20.340 --> 01:15:23.680
There are turbo codes for the
bandwidth-limited regime that

01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:27.130
get you to within 1 dB
of the Shannon limit.

01:15:27.130 --> 01:15:30.700
Sequential decoding gets you to
within about 1 and a 1/2 dB

01:15:30.700 --> 01:15:33.260
of the Shannon limit.

01:15:33.260 --> 01:15:34.510
The idea of multi-level
codes --

01:15:37.450 --> 01:15:42.260
you can regard each of these
two-way partitions as being

01:15:42.260 --> 01:15:45.340
specified by one bit.

01:15:45.340 --> 01:15:48.570
So with three bits of labels,
you can specify

01:15:48.570 --> 01:15:51.150
an eight-way partition.

01:15:51.150 --> 01:15:54.100
Another idea is to code on
each of these levels

01:15:54.100 --> 01:15:55.500
separately.

01:15:55.500 --> 01:15:58.300
Use a binary code on each of
these levels separately.

01:15:58.300 --> 01:16:04.080
Each of these corresponds to an
effective channel that has

01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:05.410
different characteristics.

01:16:05.410 --> 01:16:09.350
You've basically got to take the
Gaussian distribution and

01:16:09.350 --> 01:16:13.450
alias it around in accord with
whatever this partition

01:16:13.450 --> 01:16:14.300
actually is.

01:16:14.300 --> 01:16:19.030
But you can come up with an
effective binary channel at

01:16:19.030 --> 01:16:20.090
each of these levels.

01:16:20.090 --> 01:16:24.240
It turns out to be a binary
symmetric input channel,

01:16:24.240 --> 01:16:27.490
always in these cases.

01:16:27.490 --> 01:16:30.960
So you could think of
taking a binary--

01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:33.690
now, each one of these channels
is going to have its

01:16:33.690 --> 01:16:36.130
own capacity.

01:16:36.130 --> 01:16:41.660
It turns out that information
theoretically, the capacity of

01:16:41.660 --> 01:16:46.600
multi-level coding on each of
these levels independently is

01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:49.460
the same as the aggregate
capacity of coding it on the

01:16:49.460 --> 01:16:50.645
whole channel.

01:16:50.645 --> 01:16:55.450
It's a lovely separability
result.

01:16:55.450 --> 01:17:00.220
So in principle, if you could
code at capacity on each of

01:17:00.220 --> 01:17:04.150
these binary channels, then you
could get to the capacity

01:17:04.150 --> 01:17:08.330
of the aggregate channel, with
a large enough constellation.

01:17:08.330 --> 01:17:09.400
So that's a good idea.

01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:14.470
We now know a lot of binary
capacity-approaching code, so

01:17:14.470 --> 01:17:17.860
let's use a turbo code or a
low-density parity-check code

01:17:17.860 --> 01:17:22.330
at each level, an appropriate
code.

01:17:22.330 --> 01:17:24.950
It turns out, as you might
expect, that the first level

01:17:24.950 --> 01:17:26.910
is the really hard level.

01:17:26.910 --> 01:17:31.470
In this case, you might have
a rate 1/3 or 1/2 code and

01:17:31.470 --> 01:17:33.750
really work hard
with your code.

01:17:33.750 --> 01:17:38.030
At the next level, the effective
error probability is

01:17:38.030 --> 01:17:40.680
much better.

01:17:40.680 --> 01:17:43.530
Making hard decisions, you might
have a probability of

01:17:43.530 --> 01:17:47.480
1/10 or lower of making
an error.

01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:49.265
So these are really much
easier problems.

01:17:49.265 --> 01:17:52.230
It might be a better idea at
these levels just to use

01:17:52.230 --> 01:17:55.940
algebraic coding or something
that works very well.

01:17:55.940 --> 01:17:59.450
The capacity is nearly one per
bit at each level, so you want

01:17:59.450 --> 01:18:02.780
to code with very little
redundancy at these next

01:18:02.780 --> 01:18:06.410
levels, but it's still capable
of approaching capacity.

01:18:06.410 --> 01:18:09.690
Well, it turns out this is a
good scenario for Reed-Solomon

01:18:09.690 --> 01:18:12.980
codes or some kind of
algebraic code.

01:18:12.980 --> 01:18:16.880
So the moral is you only
really need your

01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:19.390
capacity-approaching code at
maybe the first or first and

01:18:19.390 --> 01:18:20.930
second levels.

01:18:20.930 --> 01:18:24.820
Down here, just use
a very high rate--

01:18:24.820 --> 01:18:34.170
1,023, 1,003 Reed-Solomon code
over gf of 2 to the 10th--

01:18:34.170 --> 01:18:36.836
very little redundancy, and
drive the error rate down as

01:18:36.836 --> 01:18:40.840
low as you like at each
of these levels.

01:18:40.840 --> 01:18:44.380
So multi-level coding is a
good way in principle.

01:18:44.380 --> 01:18:46.830
I'm not sure if it's been
done in practice.

01:18:46.830 --> 01:18:50.940
In fact, I don't know of any
capacity-approaching code that

01:18:50.940 --> 01:18:54.380
has been done in practice,
except there's a very crude

01:18:54.380 --> 01:19:02.450
technique, I would say, called
Bit-Interleaved Coded

01:19:02.450 --> 01:19:08.070
Modulation, BICM, which is the
following simple idea.

01:19:12.910 --> 01:19:16.470
Let's just take a single
low-density parity-check code

01:19:16.470 --> 01:19:20.290
or some capacity-approaching
code.

01:19:20.290 --> 01:19:23.620
It's going to have to be
designed for a BICM channel.

01:19:23.620 --> 01:19:26.650
Let's totally interleave the
bits and then let's use them

01:19:26.650 --> 01:19:29.640
as the bits that control each
of these levels here.

01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:32.070
At the output of the channel,
we know which level the bits

01:19:32.070 --> 01:19:33.410
came out of.

01:19:33.410 --> 01:19:36.120
So at the output of the channel,
we know what the

01:19:36.120 --> 01:19:38.820
appropriate a posteriori
probabilities

01:19:38.820 --> 01:19:40.500
are for each bit.

01:19:40.500 --> 01:19:41.850
They're going to be
wildly different.

01:19:41.850 --> 01:19:43.690
A bit sent through here is going
to be sent through a

01:19:43.690 --> 01:19:46.130
very highly reliable channel,
a bit sent through here is

01:19:46.130 --> 01:19:48.780
going to be sent through a very
low reliability channel.

01:19:48.780 --> 01:19:53.500
But with all this interleaving
and the independence

01:19:53.500 --> 01:19:56.380
approximation in the analysis,
we're going to be able to

01:19:56.380 --> 01:20:00.380
design a code for this mixture
channel, a mixture of high

01:20:00.380 --> 01:20:03.560
reliability and low reliability
binary channels,

01:20:03.560 --> 01:20:06.290
that's going to get to the
capacity of this mixture

01:20:06.290 --> 01:20:10.590
channel, which as I've already
told you is equal to the

01:20:10.590 --> 01:20:12.440
capacity of the aggregate
channel.

01:20:16.260 --> 01:20:19.480
I guess there's some elegant
features of it.

01:20:19.480 --> 01:20:21.740
But that's, in practice,
what people use.

01:20:21.740 --> 01:20:23.790
They use it more because they've
already developed a

01:20:23.790 --> 01:20:28.220
chip for binary channels, and
they want to reuse that chip

01:20:28.220 --> 01:20:32.310
for some large constellation
channel, some

01:20:32.310 --> 01:20:34.520
bandwidth-limited channel.

01:20:34.520 --> 01:20:38.120
So this was originally advocated
by Qualcomm as a,

01:20:38.120 --> 01:20:40.740
quote, pragmatic approach.

01:20:40.740 --> 01:20:46.030
OK, we've got a chip that works
for binary channels, so

01:20:46.030 --> 01:20:51.640
let's just interleave outputs
and use it over this

01:20:51.640 --> 01:20:54.750
multi-level channel and it'll
probably work well enough.

01:20:54.750 --> 01:20:56.930
And, in fact, that's true.

01:20:56.930 --> 01:20:59.390
And the information support
for it, again, is the fact

01:20:59.390 --> 01:21:06.180
that you don't lose anything
by coding bit by bit from a

01:21:06.180 --> 01:21:07.636
capacity point of view.

01:21:12.820 --> 01:21:17.030
I think that's the only one
that's been used in practice.

01:21:17.030 --> 01:21:22.800
And on wireless cellular
channels for instance, that

01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:24.300
tends to be what's used.

01:21:27.340 --> 01:21:32.770
And of course, I know that
perhaps a couple of you have

01:21:32.770 --> 01:21:35.550
an exam at 11:00, so I'll
make a point of

01:21:35.550 --> 01:21:37.790
letting you out of here.

01:21:37.790 --> 01:21:40.150
I've really enjoyed teaching
the course this term.

01:21:40.150 --> 01:21:43.110
It was the first time I was able
to get to the analysis of

01:21:43.110 --> 01:21:48.240
capacity-approaching codes,
so I enjoyed doing that.

01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:55.000
At this point, I think the
subject of coding for the

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:58.080
additive white Gaussian noise
channel, the traditional

01:21:58.080 --> 01:21:59.780
channel, is pretty
well wrapped up.

01:21:59.780 --> 01:22:02.360
I don't think we're going to
see any great improvements.

01:22:02.360 --> 01:22:05.340
There's still some very
interesting theoretical

01:22:05.340 --> 01:22:08.160
questions about the convergence
of these iterative

01:22:08.160 --> 01:22:09.280
decoding algorithms.

01:22:09.280 --> 01:22:10.980
What do they converge to?

01:22:10.980 --> 01:22:12.650
How fast do they converge?

01:22:12.650 --> 01:22:15.510
There are interesting
connections to statistical

01:22:15.510 --> 01:22:17.960
physics and inference
and so forth that

01:22:17.960 --> 01:22:19.365
people are still exploring.

01:22:19.365 --> 01:22:22.190
They're interested in graph
theoretical properties.

01:22:22.190 --> 01:22:25.220
There's attempts to
algebraically construct these

01:22:25.220 --> 01:22:28.120
capacity-approaching codes, so
we can say a lot more about

01:22:28.120 --> 01:22:31.460
their parameters and their
performance, particularly for

01:22:31.460 --> 01:22:34.360
lower probabilities like
10 to the minus 15.

01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:37.360
So you go to the information
theory symposium, you'll still

01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:40.750
hear a lot of papers about
coding effectively for

01:22:40.750 --> 01:22:44.830
additive white Gaussian noise or
memoryless binary symmetric

01:22:44.830 --> 01:22:47.110
input channels.

01:22:47.110 --> 01:22:53.800
But people ask me, is
coding dead now?

01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:56.020
Are Fourier transforms dead?

01:22:56.020 --> 01:22:57.150
No, they're not dead.

01:22:57.150 --> 01:23:01.220
But they've become sort of part
of the standard core of

01:23:01.220 --> 01:23:03.570
what you should know.

01:23:03.570 --> 01:23:07.240
I think this is a subject that
anyone in communication should

01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:10.130
certainly learn, but is it an
area where people are going to

01:23:10.130 --> 01:23:14.210
make further advances that are
important from a practical

01:23:14.210 --> 01:23:14.750
point of view?

01:23:14.750 --> 01:23:17.990
Obviously not very much, in
view of the Shannon limit.

01:23:17.990 --> 01:23:21.030
We are very close to the
Shannon limit for these

01:23:21.030 --> 01:23:24.290
channels, and have been
now for a few years.

01:23:24.290 --> 01:23:27.350
So it's important to know
about these things.

01:23:27.350 --> 01:23:29.850
It's important to know when
you're in the wireless course,

01:23:29.850 --> 01:23:31.150
for instance.

01:23:31.150 --> 01:23:33.980
You basically calculate mutual
information and assume that

01:23:33.980 --> 01:23:36.810
you can go at the mutual
information.

01:23:36.810 --> 01:23:38.690
This is how you do it.

01:23:38.690 --> 01:23:43.770
So you should know how it's
done, and that's why I think

01:23:43.770 --> 01:23:46.820
this course continues to
be worth teaching.

01:23:46.820 --> 01:23:50.740
But from a point of view of
research, it's become a rather

01:23:50.740 --> 01:23:53.790
mature area, and the action
has gone off to

01:23:53.790 --> 01:23:55.290
other kinds of channels.

01:23:55.290 --> 01:23:57.120
Multi this, multi
that, so forth.

01:23:57.120 --> 01:24:00.830
Anything to do with networks
or multi-user is where the

01:24:00.830 --> 01:24:03.410
action in coding is.

01:24:03.410 --> 01:24:05.740
Data compression, of course, is
a subject that we haven't

01:24:05.740 --> 01:24:09.180
talked about at all, which
is also coding.

01:24:09.180 --> 01:24:12.630
So anyway, I think it's good for
you to have all this under

01:24:12.630 --> 01:24:14.460
your belts.

01:24:14.460 --> 01:24:18.570
I hope that you find it useful
in your future lives, and I

01:24:18.570 --> 01:24:19.970
wish you all well on
the final exam.

01:24:19.970 --> 01:24:21.220
Thank you.
