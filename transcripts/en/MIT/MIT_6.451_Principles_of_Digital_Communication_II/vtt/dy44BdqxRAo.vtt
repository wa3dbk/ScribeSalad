00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:06.120
PROFESSOR: We're into
chapter 11.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.520
I've asked Ashish to hand out
today a revision of the

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.140
previous version of chapter
11, plus chapter 12 on the

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:18.430
sum-product algorithm,
in case we get to it.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.990
I'm giving you a complete copy
of the problem seven solutions

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.240
for both weeks, and to get back
on track, we're handing

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.740
out problem set eight.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.520
There probably will only
be one more problem set

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.830
that you hand in.

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:34.260
All right.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.350
We've been getting to the
centerpiece of the second half

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.300
of the course which is codes
on graphs, which is the way

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.430
we're going to get to
capacity-achieving codes by

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.840
building them on graphs of
linear complexity and decoding

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.750
them on the graphs with
iterative decoding.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.980
I frame this in the language
of behavioral realizations.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:07.180
I say a graph is a realization
of a code via a behavior,

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.250
which is the set of
all the possible

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.040
trajectories on the graph.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.030
So this is, again, putting it
in system theory language.

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.240
I want to distinguish between
two types of variables.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.890
The external ones,
which communicate

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.860
with the outside world--

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.930
in our case, these will be the
symbols in a code word.

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.350
These are the ones that are
actually involved in the code.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.900
So these are more or less
pre-specified for us when

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.470
we're trying to realize
a code.

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.660
But we can adjoin auxiliary
variables, internal variables,

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.510
we often call them state
variables, hidden variables,

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.920
latent variables, which are
really there for our

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:49.730
convenience.

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.910
They're to make the realization
simpler, or more

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:57.090
elegant in some way, or to have
properties, or whatever.

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.700
But these are free for us to
have because they're inside

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.190
the box and the world
never sees them.

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.840
Now, we describe the behavior by
a set of constraints on the

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.590
variables, which in our case,
these are local constraints

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.200
that only involves a few of
the variables, each one.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.250
The idea is to express a global
behavior via local

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.000
constraints on variables.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.410
And in our case, the constraints
will be expressed

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.650
by equations, as we've seen,
or in a little bit more

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:38.000
generality by little codes,
which will go in to make up

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.310
this big code.

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.960
So in some sense, you can think
of codes on graphs as

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.150
being making big codes out of
little codes, making global

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.890
codes out of local codes.

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.290
The behavior, then, is simply
defined as the set of all

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.330
combinations of variables, both
external and internal,

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.700
that satisfy all the
constraints.

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.390
If we can find a set of values
for all the variables such

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.730
that all these local constraints
are satisfied,

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:12.430
then that's called a valid
trajectory, or whatever.

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.830
And that's the entire
behavior.

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:21.090
And the code is simply the set
of all external variable

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.930
n-tuples that occur as parts
of valid behaviors--

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.370
in other words, the projection
of the behavior just onto the

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:28.990
external variables.

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:32.940
All right, so it's an elegant
and rather implicit way of

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.750
describing the code, but we'll
see it's very, very powerful.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.210
And last time, we talked
about various styles of

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:44.260
realizations.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.160
I gave you examples of generator
representations and

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.770
parity-check representations.

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:53.390
This is really where it all
started, with parity-check

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.610
representations, where this
style of graphical

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.720
representation is
very natural.

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.950
You've got the symbols in the
code, those are the only

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.340
symbols you need, and you've
got parity checks, and the

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.360
parity checks constrain
the symbols.

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.350
If you've got n minus k parity
checks, you get n minus k

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:14.590
constraints.

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.610
And it's a kernel representation
in the language

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:22.290
of linear algebra.

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:28.120
It's simply the set of all code
n-tuples that satisfy all

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.290
the parity checks.

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:32.260
That's it, we don't need
any hidden variables.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.620
In a generator representation,
this is a more natural

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.940
representation, when we're
trying to generate

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.360
or simulate a code.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:47.530
We want to run through a set
of inputs that in effect

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.340
create all the outputs,
all the code words.

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.720
In this case, we don't actually
see the inputs as

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.590
part of the code words,
necessarily.

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.230
We might, we might not.

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:59.400
But we distinguish them in this
representation and we

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.620
regard the inputs as hidden
variables, or state variables,

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:03.850
if you like.

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:06.340
They're part of the realization,
but they don't

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.050
actually occur in the code
words, so they fit into the

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.940
hidden category.

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.990
OK, and we talked about
two styles of graphs.

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.400
Tanner graphs, which are older
and more established.

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.870
Tanner really wrote the
foundation paper in this

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.030
subject in 1981.

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:26.930
I regard him as the
founder of the

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:29.340
subject of codes on graphs.

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.850
However, like a lot of
good papers, his

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.360
was completely ignored--

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:45.540
that's almost true--
for 15 years.

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:49.210
And then it was rediscovered
around 1995, when people began

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.120
to wake up to this
subject again.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.490
And Tanner graphs really
come out of this idea.

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:57.570
They were closely associated
with that.

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:00.290
We can generalize them
to be more like this.

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:01.960
But it's this simple idea.

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:05.280
We have a bipartite graph, we
make one class of vertices

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:09.510
into the variables, one class
into the constraints, and we

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:13.170
simply tie a variable to a
constraint when it's involved

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:14.430
in the constraint.

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:18.280
And we can generalize it by
making internal and external

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:20.410
variables, which we have
to distinguish in the

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:22.160
picture in some way.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:27.180
And the constraints, initially,
they were just

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:29.380
zero-sum constraints and
parity-check codes.

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:31.290
One of the things Tanner did was
he said, well, they could

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:32.950
be any codes.

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:37.970
A single parity check is like
a single parity-check code.

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:41.620
And we can make any codes
the constraints.

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:44.870
And the edges don't work very
hard in the Tanner graph.

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:49.120
They implicitly carry the
variables to the constraints

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.506
so we could label them
with the variables.

00:06:51.506 --> 00:06:54.610
And we showed how a Tanner
graph could always be

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:58.480
transformed to this normal
graph, which I think is

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:01.890
certainly in more complicated
situations, a cleaner way of

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:06.480
explaining things, and cleaner
in a variety of senses.

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:09.780
Here is our taxonomy.

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:14.370
Vertices indicate constraints,
half edges

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:17.180
indicate external variables.

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:19.810
A half edge is something you can
tie to another half edge

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:22.190
to form an I/O pad.

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:25.170
Edges tie together
two constraints.

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:27.210
They're internal, and
so these represent

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:29.070
the internal variables.

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:31.760
And this is cleaner both
analytically--

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.520
there's this nice duality
theorem about normal graphs

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.880
that I won't be presenting
to you, and a

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.720
couple other things.

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:41.190
They're cleaner when you
come to implement

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:43.670
the sum-product algorithm.

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:47.730
I think they're just generally
cleaner, but I may be biased.

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:50.490
I want you to see both because
these still predominate the

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:53.550
literature, although more and
more people seem to be using

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:55.040
this style of graph,
and that's what I

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.433
will use in the course.

00:07:56.433 --> 00:07:57.420
All right?

00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:01.820
So that's a review
of where we are.

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:03.710
OK.

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:08.420
Today we're going to go on to
other important styles of

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:14.780
realizations, and particularly
the next one we'll talk about

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:17.490
is trellis realizations.

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:22.550
So this will tie back to all the
work we did in chapter 10.

00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:26.020
And what did we discover
in chapter 10?

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:29.330
The key to a trellis
realization was a

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:32.780
trellis-oriented generator
matrix.

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:40.929
And again, I will put up our
favorite matrix on the board,

00:08:40.929 --> 00:08:44.555
the generator of the 8,
4, 4 Reed-Muller code.

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:52.440
And in the form we've come
to know and love,

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:54.510
it looks like this.

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:58.810
And what makes it
trellis-oriented is that all

00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:00.940
the starting times are different
and all the ending

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:02.170
times are different.

00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:05.460
Therefore these generators
are as short as possible.

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:08.200
The main feature of this
generator that we want to look

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:13.580
at is the spans, the active
parts of the generators, which

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:15.300
we've made as short
as possible.

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:20.130
And let me explicitly write
out what they are.

00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:24.330
The first generator is active
from symbol time 0

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.080
to symbol time 3.

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:30.870
This one is active
from 1 to 6.

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:35.930
This one is active
from 2 to 5.

00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:40.570
And this one is active
from 4 to 7.

00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:42.380
OK, so those are the
active spans.

00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:47.250
And we know from that, we can
find the dimensions of minimal

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:50.790
state spaces and of minimal
branch spaces.

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:53.490
OK, we just count the number of
active generators at either

00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:56.690
of the state times, which are
between the symbols, or the

00:09:56.690 --> 00:10:00.310
symbol times themselves
for the branches.

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:04.220
OK, again, quick review,
especially because we have a

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:07.050
few guests here who we haven't
seen previously in the course.

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:09.620
So that's where we've been.

00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:12.020
All right.

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:17.730
Once you have any generator
matrix, or in particular a

00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:21.130
trellis-oriented generator
matrix, the code is simply

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:27.250
described as the set of all
linear combinations of the

00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:29.176
matrix elements.

00:10:29.176 --> 00:10:32.710
And in particular, the code
symbol at every time is a

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:36.980
linear combination of the
matrix elements in a

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:38.890
particular column.

00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:42.350
All right, so let's use that to
get a trellis realization.

00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:47.870
I've done this in
various ways.

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:52.940
I'm still not satisfied, though
the way that I do it in

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:58.830
the notes is quite notation
heavy and mathematical.

00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:03.240
I hope this picture of what
we're going to do is going to

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:08.570
give you a totally transparent
idea of what's going on.

00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:15.770
OK, we're going to have
a trellis realization.

00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:18.160
Let's write down the
symbol times.

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:21.170
And I'll write them all the
way across the board.

00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:26.765
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:39.510
And let me save the
coefficients, ui, here.

00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:43.060
And I'll write them as equality
constraints, but you

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:48.200
can also think of them as a
little binary shift register.

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:52.500
I'm going to need u1 at
four different times.

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:55.060
I'm going to need u1 during
its span at time

00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:57.410
0, 1, 2, and 3.

00:11:57.410 --> 00:12:01.460
So I'll set up a set of
constraints here to propagate

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:04.262
u1 between these three times.

00:12:04.262 --> 00:12:07.470
And u1 is going to be an
internal variable.

00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:10.030
Strictly, there are three
replicas of this internal

00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:11.930
variable here.

00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:14.080
And I can pull it out
at each time, too.

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:21.650
So this is where I'm going
to keep u1, in effect.

00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:28.540
Similarly, u2 I'm going to keep
around for all the times

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:31.680
that I need it, which
is these six times.

00:12:39.978 --> 00:12:43.590
OK, so is that six?

00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:45.280
That's only five.

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:51.120
These are all the times that u2
is actually involved in the

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:54.950
output symbols, so I'm going
to have it when I need it.

00:12:54.950 --> 00:12:57.136
u3 I need for four times.

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:10.020
I've been inconsistent in
whether I write the variables

00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:12.730
or the values of
the variables.

00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:14.660
In this case, I'm
writing values.

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:18.770
And finally, u4.

00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:21.250
I see I'm going to need more
than one board here.

00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:34.580
So now I've got everything
I need at the

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:39.390
time that I need it.

00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:41.795
Now, this is going
to be tricky.

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.800
I'm simply going to have
a linear combination--

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:53.710
call it g0, g1, and so forth--

00:13:53.710 --> 00:14:00.810
which is going to create my
output at time 0, or time 1,

00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:02.640
or time 2, and so forth.

00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:11.530
And you'll agree from this
generator matrix that the

00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:15.870
output at time 1 is some linear
combination of u1.

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:24.390
And the output at time 2 is
some linear combination of

00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:25.640
these two guys.

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:36.100
OK, and the output at time 3 is
some linear combination of

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:42.610
these three guys,
and so forth.

00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:44.240
You see what I'm doing?

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:48.000
So I could describe these as
simply a linear constraint.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.310
What are the possible
combinations of inputs and

00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:52.810
outputs in this constraint?

00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:54.060
And similarly--

00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:01.620
and don't make me draw
the lines in.

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:33.310
OK, so I claim this is a
realization directly from this

00:15:33.310 --> 00:15:35.280
trellis-oriented generator
matrix.

00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:35.820
Yes?

00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:42.885
AUDIENCE: In this example in
the generator, g has a 0

00:15:42.885 --> 00:15:44.070
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:15:44.070 --> 00:15:44.950
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:48.450
AUDIENCE: So before, the
component had to be 0 in the

00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:49.350
linear combination?

00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:50.130
Or are you--

00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:53.710
PROFESSOR: I can
do it that way.

00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:57.670
Clearly, I don't need this
input at this time.

00:15:57.670 --> 00:15:59.360
So I could erase that.

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:01.940
Would that make you
feel better?

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:05.840
Actually, that gives an
even better picture.

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:09.420
It's not going to make any
fundamental difference, but

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:12.660
I'm doing this for a generic set
of generators that cover

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:14.060
these spans.

00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:14.430
All right?

00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:17.490
For the particular ones we have
here, yes, I can make

00:16:17.490 --> 00:16:22.780
that further change and
eliminate those two inputs.

00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:29.170
But I'm shortly going to
aggregate this and put it in a

00:16:29.170 --> 00:16:30.600
more aggregated form.

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:33.490
And what's happening internally
here then won't

00:16:33.490 --> 00:16:36.900
matter to us very much.

00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:38.270
OK.

00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:44.970
And notice that I can regard
this as the branch

00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:47.480
space at this time.

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:51.270
And it has the right dimension
for the branch space at each

00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:52.610
of these times.

00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:56.680
And let me take it a
little more slowly.

00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:58.920
First, I claim it's
a realization.

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:01.730
If I built that thing with
the appropriate linear

00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:06.640
combinations here, then the
behavior of this is basically

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:10.589
the set of all u's and y's
that satisfy all these

00:17:10.589 --> 00:17:11.390
constraints.

00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:14.040
And if I just look at the
outputs, that's the set of all

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:15.950
code words.

00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:20.630
So I've constructed a behavioral
realization in a

00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:22.700
certain way.

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:26.579
OK, and now I'm going to
start to aggregate.

00:17:26.579 --> 00:17:32.016
Aggregate just means drawing
lines around sub-graphs.

00:17:32.016 --> 00:17:34.530
Or sometimes in the notes, I
call this agglomeration.

00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:43.700
So I'm going to regard all this
as one constraint on the

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:47.380
variables that come
out of this.

00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:50.140
The constraints that are
affected by this

00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:51.020
agglomeration--

00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:55.210
the variables that are affected
are y0 and u1.

00:17:55.210 --> 00:17:58.820
OK, so this I can draw--

00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:02.020
let me draw it this way--

00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:06.590
as a little constraint code
which operates at time 0.

00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:11.450
And it's a linear 2, 1 code that
basically ties together

00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:18.910
y0 and u1, whatever the
relationship between them is.

00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:20.950
It probably is the
y0 equals u1.

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:26.200
The first generator starts
at this time.

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:28.210
That's about the only
thing it could be.

00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:31.990
Similarly, I'm going to
aggregate all this part of the

00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:36.140
realization here and consider
it a big block, or a big

00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:37.390
constraint.

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:43.340
At time 1, there's some
constraint that affects

00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:50.760
y1 and u1 and u2.

00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:53.990
So this is a little
4, 2 code on the

00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:55.550
four incident variables.

00:18:55.550 --> 00:18:58.640
One of the constraints is
that u1 on this side

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:00.520
equals u1 on this side.

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:02.750
These are really two replicas
of the same thing.

00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:04.240
So there's an equality
constraint

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:05.830
propagating through there.

00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:10.560
Then I have some function of y1
as a function of u1, which

00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:13.900
I'm going to regard as the
state at this time.

00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:19.300
And u1 and u2, let me call that
state space at time 1.

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:22.660
Let me call this at time 0,
let me call this the state

00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:24.630
space at time 1.

00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:28.810
And I did go through a
development where I showed

00:19:28.810 --> 00:19:31.580
that these u's could be regarded
as the components of

00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:32.570
the state spaces.

00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:37.730
This is a more constructive way
of seeing the same thing.

00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:41.680
And notice they have the
right dimensions.

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:45.330
So the states are what carry the
information from time 0 to

00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:47.640
time 1, just as we would want.

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:50.220
They kind of embody the
Markov property.

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:50.662
Yes?

00:19:50.662 --> 00:19:53.320
AUDIENCE: Why is c0 length 2?

00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:56.308
PROFESSOR: Why is c0--

00:19:56.308 --> 00:19:57.590
AUDIENCE: Length 2.

00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:58.270
PROFESSOR: Length 2.

00:19:58.270 --> 00:19:59.880
Because it affects two bits.

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:00.940
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:02.610
PROFESSOR: It affects
these two bits.

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:10.340
Let's see, how did I know that
there's only one possible

00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:11.280
constraint here?

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:14.360
Because that's the dimension
of the branch space.

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:18.390
It's really all determined
by u1.

00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:21.790
Over here, however, it's
determined by u1 and u2.

00:20:21.790 --> 00:20:26.550
So the dimension is 2. u1 and
u2 are free, And the others

00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:29.490
are fixed once we know those.

00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:32.560
So I was a little ahead
of myself there.

00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:37.180
And similarly, let's keep
drawing in this fashion,

00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:43.660
here's a constraint code at
time 2 which relates these

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:48.840
possible variables, u1, u2, u3,
which I'm going to call

00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:54.710
the state space at time 2.

00:20:54.710 --> 00:21:00.710
So my times are not
what I expect.

00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:05.340
But it's always really a problem
to keep the indexes

00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:06.440
consistent.

00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:14.330
We want state time 1 to occur
after the first symbol.

00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:19.160
So this should be state time 2,
this should be state time 3

00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:21.110
to be consistent with
what's in the notes.

00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:22.360
I'm sorry.

00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:26.460
And so forth.

00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:28.770
What is the length
of this code?

00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:33.960
It's simply the number of bits
that it controls, which is 6.

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:36.400
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:39.290
What's the dimension?

00:21:39.290 --> 00:21:46.710
It's 3, because u1, u2, u3 are
free if I only look at this

00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:48.850
constraint independent
of everything else.

00:21:52.056 --> 00:21:55.840
OK, and continuing this way,
at this point, you notice I

00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:59.320
only have u2 and u3.

00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:02.880
So my state space at time 4 has
gone down in dimension.

00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:12.630
And here I have c3, which is,
again, a 6, 3 code, and so

00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:13.970
forth, as I go ahead.

00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:18.900
Let me just draw it.

00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:20.995
This is also a 6, 3.

00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:27.635
This is time 5.

00:22:33.288 --> 00:22:37.400
I have the state space
at time 6.

00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:49.250
This is back down to 1, 4.

00:22:49.250 --> 00:22:52.610
It's symmetrical on this
side, as you know.

00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:10.400
So that's my trellis
realization.

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:14.780
And I claim this, too, is a
realization, in the sense that

00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:19.050
any combination of u's and y's
that satisfy all of these

00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:23.300
constraints is a legitimate
trajectory.

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:27.100
And the set of all y's that are
part of those legitimate

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:29.350
trajectories form the code.

00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:34.630
In fact, it's pretty explicit
here that the dimension of the

00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:39.330
code is 4, corresponding
to u1, u2, u3.

00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:45.040
So I have 8 outputs, I have
16 possible behaviors.

00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:49.270
I pick off the combinations of
u's and y's that could make

00:23:49.270 --> 00:23:53.430
that, which is basically
determined by this matrix.

00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:57.900
And I just pick off the y's
and that's my 8, 4 code.

00:23:57.900 --> 00:24:03.720
OK, so that's what trellis
looks like.

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:06.645
The constraint code really
embodies the branches.

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:13.010
This encapsulates everything
that can happen at time 0.

00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:17.370
This encapsulates everything
that could happen at time 1.

00:24:17.370 --> 00:24:21.670
The u's are really
my state spaces.

00:24:21.670 --> 00:24:27.180
This constrains state, output,
next state, in nice linear

00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:28.920
system theories style.

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:31.720
This tells me what combinations
of state, output,

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:35.020
next state, I can have
at time 2, and so

00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:36.800
forth across the board.

00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:40.240
So the constraints are
local constraints--

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:41.900
local in time, in this sense--

00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:46.470
that constrain what can happen
as you get to the next state.

00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:48.380
Once you get to the next state,
this state has the

00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:49.340
Markov property.

00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:52.470
This is all that the memory you
need of the past in order

00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:55.700
to determine the future, or
the whole set of future

00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:58.380
possibilities.

00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:03.610
Each of these is a linear
vector space

00:25:03.610 --> 00:25:04.660
over the ground field.

00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:07.620
In fact, it's just the space
of 1-tuples, 2-tuples,

00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:10.570
3-tuples, 2-tuples,
and so forth.

00:25:10.570 --> 00:25:14.220
And it has certain dimension,
in this case,

00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:16.170
equal to its size.

00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:19.470
And if you calculate
the dimensions of--

00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:24.290
call this the state space,
call this the branch

00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:27.890
constraint code if you like,
or the branch space, it's

00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:33.190
isomorphic, the dimensions are
minimal here by construction

00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:36.105
from the trellis-oriented
generator matrix.

00:25:36.105 --> 00:25:41.600
If we want to know the minimal
size of the state space at

00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:48.740
time 4 here in the center, we
just calculate the number of

00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:52.070
generators that are active at
time 4, and that's precisely

00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:53.850
what we're going to get over
there, too, by our

00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:54.880
construction.

00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:58.045
If we want to compute the
dimension of the branch space

00:25:58.045 --> 00:26:01.630
at time 3, it's the number
of active generators

00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:02.890
at symbol time 3.

00:26:02.890 --> 00:26:06.960
There are 3 active ones, and
we've just forced this to have

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:08.230
that structure.

00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:17.350
So this is a normal graph of a
minimal trellis realization of

00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:19.540
the 8, 4 code.

00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:21.410
OK?

00:26:21.410 --> 00:26:24.820
So we can clearly do that
for any code, right?

00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:25.840
For any code, we can find a

00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:27.340
trellis-oriented generator matrix.

00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:30.130
We can go through these steps,
and we'll always come up with

00:26:30.130 --> 00:26:32.061
something that looks like
this down here.

00:26:34.770 --> 00:26:37.990
OK, now, what are the properties
of this graph?

00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:39.240
Does it have cycles?

00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:50.740
Does this graph have cycles?

00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:52.220
Anybody?

00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:54.580
"No," is one answer I get.

00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:57.190
What's the other possible
answer?

00:26:57.190 --> 00:27:00.200
How many people say no, and
how many people say yes?

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:01.400
I want to see a show of hands.

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:04.275
How many people think this
graph is cycle free?

00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:12.430
OK, and how many people think
that it has cycles?

00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:15.860
OK, the majority is wrong.

00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:17.820
This graph clearly has cycles.

00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:19.460
Here are two edges here,
and here's a cycle.

00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:28.380
OK, so as a graph, it has cycles
because it has multiple

00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:30.525
edges going between
these constraints.

00:27:33.130 --> 00:27:39.080
All right, so a good thing
to do is to make this a

00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:45.860
cycle-free graph, and that's
just a matter of regarding

00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:50.190
this as instead of two binary
variables, we regard it as one

00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:53.150
quaternary variable.

00:27:53.150 --> 00:28:02.540
All right, so we're going to
regard this as a single binary

00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:04.350
variable of dimension one.

00:28:04.350 --> 00:28:06.680
This is a quaternary
state space.

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:08.910
There are 4 possible
states here.

00:28:08.910 --> 00:28:12.620
So the dimension of the state
space at this time is 2.

00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:21.050
So when I draw abbreviations
like this, you can think of

00:28:21.050 --> 00:28:25.550
them as being decomposable
into binary

00:28:25.550 --> 00:28:27.660
variables, if you like.

00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:32.520
But the advantage of drawing
them as larger variables,

00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:38.460
higher-valued variables,
is that now does this

00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:39.710
graph have a cycle?

00:28:43.790 --> 00:28:47.670
No, this graph is cycle free.

00:28:47.670 --> 00:28:51.880
I've just gotten rid of all
the possible cycles.

00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:56.670
How can you tell if a
graph is cycle free?

00:28:56.670 --> 00:28:57.500
Various ways.

00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:00.550
I think the most elegant one is
to say if every edge is by

00:29:00.550 --> 00:29:03.740
itself a cut-set, then the
graph is cycle free.

00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:08.670
If I remove any edge,
then I decompose the

00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:11.010
graph into two parts.

00:29:11.010 --> 00:29:12.930
And that's clearly true
of this graph.

00:29:12.930 --> 00:29:15.670
We don't really have to
test the half edges.

00:29:15.670 --> 00:29:18.160
In fact, this is kind
of the defining

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:20.440
concept of a state space.

00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:22.480
A state space is kind
of a cut between the

00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:24.320
past and the future.

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:27.980
When we asked about the minimal
state space, we asked

00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:31.830
what's the minimal dimension of
the information, the state,

00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:36.730
that we need to pass from
the past to the future?

00:29:36.730 --> 00:29:39.140
And so states correspond
to cuts.

00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:45.120
If we make each state space,
if we consider it to be a

00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:53.830
single variable, then we get
just a chain graph on a

00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:57.890
sequential time axis, as is
conventional in system theory,

00:29:57.890 --> 00:30:02.100
as your conventional
integer-time axis for discrete

00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:03.310
time systems.

00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:06.040
In this case, it only has a
finite number of times where

00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:07.380
anything happens.

00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:09.690
But you can think of
this as part of the

00:30:09.690 --> 00:30:11.010
infinite set of integers.

00:30:11.010 --> 00:30:13.150
And so this is everything
that happens.

00:30:13.150 --> 00:30:15.030
And a trellis is always going
to be very boring.

00:30:15.030 --> 00:30:17.600
It's always going to
look like this.

00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:22.270
But the advantage of now we
have this cycle-free graph

00:30:22.270 --> 00:30:26.800
realization, we'll find out that
we can do exact decoding

00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:29.870
of cycle-free realizations
using the sum-product

00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:35.470
algorithm, or the min-sum
algorithm, which in this case

00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:37.830
kind of reduces to the Viterbi
algorithm with

00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:40.820
an asterisk on it.

00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:46.160
And the cost of doing that is
that now have to instead of

00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:48.370
considering two binary variables
here, I have to

00:30:48.370 --> 00:30:52.500
consider a single variable that
has four possible states.

00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:56.560
So basically, I'm going to be
carrying messages which are

00:30:56.560 --> 00:31:01.370
vectors indexed by the state
space across here.

00:31:01.370 --> 00:31:03.970
And in this case, the vector is
going to have to have four

00:31:03.970 --> 00:31:07.420
elements, which are going to be
likelihoods or metrics or

00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:10.140
weights of some kind.

00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:13.510
It's basically telling me what's
the weight of each of

00:31:13.510 --> 00:31:15.940
the four possible survivors,
if you can think of the

00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:17.570
trellis that goes with this.

00:31:17.570 --> 00:31:18.820
Or here, I'm going to
need to carry a

00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:20.550
vector with 8 elements.

00:31:20.550 --> 00:31:27.960
So it takes more to specify a
vector with 8 elements than 3

00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:30.920
vectors each with
two elements.

00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:35.220
So by aggregating these, I've
created a sort of exponential

00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:40.760
complexity situation as these
state spaces get very big.

00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:43.048
But on the other hand,
I get cycle freedom.

00:31:43.048 --> 00:31:43.924
All right?

00:31:43.924 --> 00:31:44.362
Yeah.

00:31:44.362 --> 00:31:46.270
AUDIENCE: There's no real
difference between this and

00:31:46.270 --> 00:31:47.520
what you had before, right?

00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:53.040
PROFESSOR: As President Clinton
might have said, it

00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:57.405
depends what the definition
of "real" is.

00:31:57.405 --> 00:31:59.920
What do you mean by
real difference?

00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:01.780
I mean, sure.

00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:07.670
We think of something u1, u2,
you can think of that as two

00:32:07.670 --> 00:32:11.190
binary variables or a single
quaternary variable.

00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:13.540
Is there any real difference
between that?

00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:15.470
Well, when we actually go to
the implement decoding

00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:17.970
algorithms, we'll find there is
a real difference in which

00:32:17.970 --> 00:32:20.260
attitude you take.

00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:25.110
But mathematically, it's a
distinction with hardly any

00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:25.420
difference.

00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:28.090
AUDIENCE: So then there's no
fundamental difference between

00:32:28.090 --> 00:32:31.110
the cycle freeness
and the cycle--

00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:34.055
PROFESSOR: No, you'll see
this real difference--

00:32:36.570 --> 00:32:39.370
there is another real,
significant difference.

00:32:39.370 --> 00:32:41.662
If I drew this as two binary
variables, I have

00:32:41.662 --> 00:32:42.840
a graph with cycles.

00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:47.840
And we'll find that I can't
do exact decoding with a

00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:51.960
sum-product algorithm on
a graph with cycles.

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:55.720
So if I tried to apply that
algorithm to this, I'd sort of

00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:58.490
iterate around this
little cycle.

00:32:58.490 --> 00:33:02.360
Whereas if I agglomerate them
into a single variable, I get

00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:03.630
rid of that behavior.

00:33:03.630 --> 00:33:08.940
And I can summarize everything
in four values.

00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:11.344
So in that sense, it's
a huge difference.

00:33:11.344 --> 00:33:14.560
AUDIENCE: Can I always transform
this whole graph

00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:17.622
into cycle-free graph using
this kind of technique?

00:33:17.622 --> 00:33:20.070
PROFESSOR: I didn't get the
first part of your question.

00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:23.190
AUDIENCE: Can I always transform
the graph with

00:33:23.190 --> 00:33:25.660
cycles to a cycle-free
graph using this--

00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:26.750
combining those--

00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:27.700
PROFESSOR: Yeah, OK.

00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:35.180
So this agglomeration technique
of drawing lines

00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:38.460
around sub-graphs and then
considering everything inside

00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:43.480
there to be a constraint, and
all the variables coming out--

00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:46.900
well, it depends on their
topology, but I can group the

00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:49.420
variables coming out
however I want--

00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:51.161
yes, I can always do that.

00:33:51.161 --> 00:33:54.107
AUDIENCE: So we can always
do that for things

00:33:54.107 --> 00:33:56.688
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:33:56.688 --> 00:33:58.680
transform the graph
into cycle free.

00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:00.180
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:08.020
But we may find that to make it
cycle free, I then have to

00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:11.940
aggregate all the edges into a
single edge between any two

00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:13.480
parts of the graph.

00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:15.799
And that may radically increase
the complexity.

00:34:15.799 --> 00:34:20.530
And I'll give you several
examples of that today.

00:34:20.530 --> 00:34:24.500
So these little fine points
all of a sudden loom large

00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:27.650
when we actually come
to build something.

00:34:27.650 --> 00:34:30.699
Let me give you another
example of that.

00:34:30.699 --> 00:34:33.110
A very fine example would
be to say, what does

00:34:33.110 --> 00:34:35.639
sectionalization consist of?

00:34:35.639 --> 00:34:37.320
We talked about
sectionalization.

00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:44.120
Suppose we want to get a trellis
graph for a 4-section

00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:48.313
trellis, where we take
pairs of variables.

00:34:48.313 --> 00:34:52.230
Well, the graph realization of
that is simply obtained by

00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:59.450
agglomerating pairs of these
blocks, like that.

00:34:59.450 --> 00:35:05.250
OK, so let me do that, and then
let me see what I've got.

00:35:05.250 --> 00:35:08.220
I've now got here, a constraint

00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:10.580
that affects two variables.

00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:16.100
Well, first of all, I've now got
only two visible bits in

00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:18.430
each of the state variables.

00:35:18.430 --> 00:35:21.060
Here I have u1, u2, here
I have u2, u3,

00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:22.960
here i have u3, u4.

00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:28.830
So we get rid of some of
this state complexity.

00:35:28.830 --> 00:35:31.385
We did this trick in another
way before, by

00:35:31.385 --> 00:35:33.600
sectionalization.

00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:36.240
So we get rid of a lot of state
spaces, including ones

00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:39.140
that are big.

00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:40.590
Let's see, what do
we have here?

00:35:40.590 --> 00:35:46.160
This is now a code which has
got two bits coming in, two

00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:46.960
bits coming out.

00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:48.500
It's a 4, 2 code.

00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:51.690
It's basically controlled
by u1 and u2.

00:35:51.690 --> 00:35:54.670
Probably y0 and y1 are
some simple linear

00:35:54.670 --> 00:35:57.320
function of u1 and u2.

00:35:57.320 --> 00:36:00.300
So this is a 4, 2
constraint code.

00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:05.870
It controls these two bits and
these two state bits, these

00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:08.100
two symbol bits, and these
two state bits.

00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:09.340
What is this over here now?

00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:13.530
We've got 2, 2, 2.

00:36:13.530 --> 00:36:18.510
So this is going to be
a code of length 6.

00:36:18.510 --> 00:36:19.940
And what dimension?

00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:23.090
This is, remember, u2, u3.

00:36:23.090 --> 00:36:26.880
So this whole behavior here is
affected by u1, u2, and u3, it

00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:28.600
has dimension 3.

00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:32.200
Or there's a shortcut I can
do here, because this is a

00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:34.160
self-dual code, all of
these little codes

00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:36.730
are going to be self-dual.

00:36:36.730 --> 00:36:38.830
Well, they're not going to be
self-dual, but they're going

00:36:38.830 --> 00:36:41.250
to be rate 1/2.

00:36:41.250 --> 00:36:44.800
Half as many bits here
as they do here.

00:36:47.410 --> 00:36:52.570
But that's another duality
theorem that we won't prove.

00:36:52.570 --> 00:36:57.270
OK, and symmetrically, we get
another code here, which is a

00:36:57.270 --> 00:37:01.350
6, 3 code, and another
one here.

00:37:01.350 --> 00:37:03.940
So we can do this.

00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:07.210
The reason I call this styles
of realization is there's

00:37:07.210 --> 00:37:09.515
obviously a lot of freedom
in how we want

00:37:09.515 --> 00:37:11.110
to depict the code.

00:37:11.110 --> 00:37:14.890
And depending on how we depict
it, when we get to decoding

00:37:14.890 --> 00:37:17.720
algorithms, it may affect the
complexity of the algorithms.

00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:20.380
So we want to find a nice
way of depicting it.

00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:23.693
AUDIENCE: I don't understand why
you-- so you want the ...

00:37:23.693 --> 00:37:25.330
freedom ... is [INAUDIBLE],
because you would only have

00:37:25.330 --> 00:37:26.470
two [UNINTELLIGIBLE] to be
used [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:28.922
And then you have two
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:37:28.922 --> 00:37:30.320
u1 and u2.

00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:31.730
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] u2 and 3.

00:37:31.730 --> 00:37:34.180
PROFESSOR: There are two
bits here, two bits

00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:37.080
here, two bits here.

00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:37.900
AUDIENCE: But that's 6.

00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:38.720
That's 6.

00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:39.050
[INAUDIBLE]

00:37:39.050 --> 00:37:40.290
PROFESSOR: Weight
6, all right.

00:37:40.290 --> 00:37:41.756
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] freedom
that you talk about.

00:37:41.756 --> 00:37:43.780
PROFESSOR: How many
possibilities are there for

00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:44.640
these 6 bits?

00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:47.280
I've got to consider all
possible combinations of u1,

00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:51.810
u2, and u3 to drive what's
happening in these two times.

00:37:54.712 --> 00:37:58.940
If I go back here and look at
those two times, I see that

00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:03.220
there are three generators that
I've got to consider,

00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:04.890
these three.

00:38:04.890 --> 00:38:08.930
All right, so for all eight
possible linear combinations

00:38:08.930 --> 00:38:12.250
of those three generators,
I'll get different

00:38:12.250 --> 00:38:14.330
combinations of these
six bits here.

00:38:22.650 --> 00:38:25.030
And I can go further.

00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:29.050
Actually, at the end of the day,
I concluded here, we said

00:38:29.050 --> 00:38:32.720
the idea of sectionalization was
to sectionalize as far as

00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:36.820
possible without increasing the
branch complexity, which

00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:40.550
we've now translated into this
constraint code complexity.

00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:45.310
And so it's even better to
just keep aggregating.

00:38:45.310 --> 00:38:47.760
Consider the first half.

00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:50.740
And this is 1, 2, 3, 4,
two bits there is

00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:53.800
still only a 6, 3 code.

00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:58.390
And the second half is still
only a 6, 3 code.

00:38:58.390 --> 00:39:02.050
When we get to the sum-product
algorithm, that means we have

00:39:02.050 --> 00:39:04.560
to compute eight things when
we get to this node.

00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:10.530
Maybe it's a slightly more
complicated thing, but as long

00:39:10.530 --> 00:39:12.856
as we keep the dimension down to
3, we're only going to have

00:39:12.856 --> 00:39:15.260
to compute eight things.

00:39:15.260 --> 00:39:18.790
So we haven't really increased
the decoding complexity at all

00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:20.170
by doing this.

00:39:20.170 --> 00:39:25.753
So that we consider to be our
best sectionalization.

00:39:25.753 --> 00:39:30.310
And if we tried to aggregate
these two, what would we get?

00:39:30.310 --> 00:39:34.020
We'd simply get the eight bits
here, we get a constraint that

00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:37.500
says it's an 8, 4 constraint, it
says these eight bits have

00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:40.660
got to be in the code.

00:39:40.660 --> 00:39:43.070
So we only go that far, because
that would increase

00:39:43.070 --> 00:39:46.020
the complexity to 16.

00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:49.560
All right, so that's our
minimal trellis.

00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:54.040
We call it a two-section trellis
where the symbol bits

00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:57.770
have been grouped
into 4-tuples.

00:39:57.770 --> 00:40:01.560
And for decoding, that's
the simplest one.

00:40:07.150 --> 00:40:10.700
So you see what kind of games
we can play here.

00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:11.000
Yeah?

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.043
AUDIENCE: At the beginning of
this process, you started at

00:40:13.043 --> 00:40:15.540
the [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:21.200
PROFESSOR: Well, you remember
in more detail how we

00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:23.660
concluded this was the optimal
sectionalization.

00:40:23.660 --> 00:40:26.265
We looked at time 3,
in particular.

00:40:26.265 --> 00:40:28.750
And we said there are three
generators that are

00:40:28.750 --> 00:40:29.890
active at time 3.

00:40:29.890 --> 00:40:33.150
So I'm going to expand that as
far as I can without bringing

00:40:33.150 --> 00:40:34.850
any more generators
into the picture.

00:40:34.850 --> 00:40:38.370
So I can't expand it over here,
because I'll hit u4.

00:40:38.370 --> 00:40:41.220
But I can expand it as far
as I want over here.

00:40:41.220 --> 00:40:42.230
And that's the way
we sectionalize.

00:40:42.230 --> 00:40:44.920
AUDIENCE: So do you always start
with [UNINTELLIGIBLE]?

00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:47.570
PROFESSOR: Well, there's
some art in this.

00:40:47.570 --> 00:40:51.480
Here it's kind of obvious
where to do it.

00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:55.073
And I give two heuristic
algorithms in the notes on

00:40:55.073 --> 00:40:59.020
sectionalization, which we'll
come up with basically the

00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:00.050
same thing.

00:41:00.050 --> 00:41:04.320
But for simple codes, you
can just eyeball it.

00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:09.220
OK, so let's see.

00:41:09.220 --> 00:41:12.630
That's another general and
very useful style of

00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:13.105
realization.

00:41:13.105 --> 00:41:16.690
It's a trellis realization,
or a sectionalized trellis

00:41:16.690 --> 00:41:17.590
realization.

00:41:17.590 --> 00:41:20.780
Is there anything else I wanted
to say about that?

00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:24.830
We can do it so that we get
minimal branch and state

00:41:24.830 --> 00:41:28.190
spaces, or constraint
complexities.

00:41:28.190 --> 00:41:32.640
It's cycle free if we aggregate
the states into a

00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:34.600
single state space.

00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:37.530
Sectionalization, we
talked about that.

00:41:37.530 --> 00:41:41.050
OK, so let me leave that up,
because we're of course not

00:41:41.050 --> 00:41:42.300
done with that.

00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:48.100
Now let me talk about some
general properties of graph

00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:49.350
realizations.

00:42:00.610 --> 00:42:04.190
And the most important thing I'm
going to talk about here

00:42:04.190 --> 00:42:06.170
is the cut-set bound.

00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:15.950
I want to get across the idea
that a graph really captures

00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:18.360
dependency relationships.

00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:22.500
If variables are incident on
the same node, they're

00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:23.800
obviously all dependent.

00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:27.460
Or if you think of larger sets
of variables aggregated in

00:42:27.460 --> 00:42:30.040
this way, then they're
somehow dependent.

00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:32.880
Variables that are very far
away on the graph are less

00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:35.510
dependent on each other than
ones that are close to each

00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:36.240
other on the graph.

00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:40.160
This is all kind of vague
and woolly statements.

00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:44.190
Let's see if we can make
them more concrete.

00:42:44.190 --> 00:42:48.830
First of all, there's a very
simple but important

00:42:48.830 --> 00:42:52.598
observation that --

00:42:52.598 --> 00:42:54.050
I'll put it this way--

00:42:54.050 --> 00:43:03.215
disconnected if and only
if independent.

00:43:03.215 --> 00:43:05.600
What does this mean?

00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:10.930
If I have a disconnected graph,
let's suppose I have

00:43:10.930 --> 00:43:14.350
one graph over here with certain
external variables.

00:43:14.350 --> 00:43:19.420
Let me aggregate them all into
y1 and some constraint 1 over

00:43:19.420 --> 00:43:25.380
here, and a completely separate
graph, some different

00:43:25.380 --> 00:43:29.320
code over here, c2, constraining
some separate set

00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:30.570
of variables, y2.

00:43:33.990 --> 00:43:37.550
OK, that's a disconnected
graph realization.

00:43:37.550 --> 00:43:40.060
It has to look like
that, right?

00:43:40.060 --> 00:43:44.115
So we're aggregating the two
disconnected halves.

00:43:44.115 --> 00:43:45.590
All right, what can I say?

00:43:45.590 --> 00:43:48.075
What code does this
graph realize?

00:43:52.570 --> 00:43:57.960
This graph, the code that it
realizes is simply the

00:43:57.960 --> 00:44:00.520
Cartesian product
of c1 and c2.

00:44:00.520 --> 00:44:07.380
In other words, this means the
set of all pairs, c1, c2, or I

00:44:07.380 --> 00:44:08.650
should say y1, y2--

00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:19.030
y1, y2 such that y1 is in code
1 and y2 is in code 2.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:27.290
That is the set of all y1,
y2 that satisfy all these

00:44:27.290 --> 00:44:28.480
constraints, right?

00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:31.810
So it's a behavioral realization
of a Cartesian

00:44:31.810 --> 00:44:33.060
product code.

00:44:37.650 --> 00:44:43.510
Now this is really a notion
of independence, right?

00:44:43.510 --> 00:44:49.100
This independently realizes a
code word from c1 in this part

00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:51.970
and a code word from
c2 in this part.

00:44:51.970 --> 00:44:53.850
What would the generator
matrix look like?

00:44:53.850 --> 00:44:57.810
The generator matrix from this
would look like a generator

00:44:57.810 --> 00:45:04.100
for c1, 0, this is a 0, and
a generator for c2.

00:45:04.100 --> 00:45:06.720
So there's a generator matrix
notion of independence.

00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:09.030
In other words, these are just
two independent codes that for

00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:12.790
some reason, we choose to
regard as one code.

00:45:12.790 --> 00:45:17.190
And the same thing is true that
if we have a Cartesian

00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:21.160
product code, simply a code
made up of two independent

00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:24.990
components, then we can always
realize it in this way, right?

00:45:24.990 --> 00:45:28.550
We just realize c1,
realize c2.

00:45:28.550 --> 00:45:32.440
So that's elementary, but it
begins to get across the idea

00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:36.740
that graph properties have to do
with dependence properties.

00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:40.440
And here's the most radical
and simple form of that.

00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:43.330
If we have a disconnected graph,
then it really realizes

00:45:43.330 --> 00:45:44.580
two independent codes.

00:45:48.350 --> 00:45:53.840
Now, more important than that
is the cut-set bound.

00:46:01.100 --> 00:46:02.350
What is a cut-set?

00:46:05.870 --> 00:46:07.230
It's a set of edges.

00:46:10.270 --> 00:46:13.220
Actually, in graph theory, it's
defined in various ways.

00:46:13.220 --> 00:46:15.070
It could be vertices,
it could be edges.

00:46:15.070 --> 00:46:19.830
Here, we're going to say it's
a set of edges whose removal

00:46:19.830 --> 00:46:21.080
disconnects the graph.

00:46:31.180 --> 00:46:33.670
Probably there are people in
this room who know more graph

00:46:33.670 --> 00:46:34.400
theory than I do?

00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:39.300
Does anyone want to quibble
or refine that in any way?

00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:42.730
That's my idea of what
a cut-set is.

00:46:42.730 --> 00:46:44.225
Any elaboration?

00:46:44.225 --> 00:46:45.155
No?

00:46:45.155 --> 00:46:47.020
All right.

00:46:47.020 --> 00:46:54.110
All right, so we have some
large graph realization.

00:46:54.110 --> 00:46:59.200
It's got vertices which I always
draw as blocks, its

00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:05.032
constraint codes, they have
various interrelationships.

00:47:05.032 --> 00:47:07.710
I'm just showing one.

00:47:07.710 --> 00:47:14.770
We have various external
variables that we bring out of

00:47:14.770 --> 00:47:17.630
that, and that's the
general graphical

00:47:17.630 --> 00:47:19.660
realization of the code.

00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:22.902
What are some cut-sets
in here?

00:47:22.902 --> 00:47:25.950
I've drawn this, I'm thinking
of this as a cut set.

00:47:25.950 --> 00:47:35.190
If I take these two edges and
remove them, then I've

00:47:35.190 --> 00:47:36.330
disconnected the graph.

00:47:36.330 --> 00:47:37.580
So they form a cut-set.

00:47:40.670 --> 00:47:44.940
I've already mentioned the very
close connection between

00:47:44.940 --> 00:47:49.060
cut-sets and cycle-free graphs,
which is the graph is

00:47:49.060 --> 00:47:53.090
cycle-free if and only if by
removing any single edge, I

00:47:53.090 --> 00:47:54.900
disconnect the graph.

00:47:54.900 --> 00:47:57.910
So every single edge is
itself a cut-set.

00:47:57.910 --> 00:48:01.430
That's a very elegant
characterization.

00:48:01.430 --> 00:48:03.230
All right, so I'm thinking
of a cut-set.

00:48:03.230 --> 00:48:08.710
I'm going to write it
as chi for scissors.

00:48:08.710 --> 00:48:12.050
And it's a set of edges.

00:48:12.050 --> 00:48:14.850
So in our cases, what
are the edges?

00:48:14.850 --> 00:48:18.970
It's a set of state spaces
for some index set.

00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:24.920
OK, so I'm going to select
some minimal set of state

00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:29.510
spaces that disconnects
the graph.

00:48:29.510 --> 00:48:31.670
All my edges are internal
variables.

00:48:31.670 --> 00:48:35.100
We don't really need to worry
about these half edges out

00:48:35.100 --> 00:48:38.430
here, as I've said before.

00:48:38.430 --> 00:48:42.620
They're always going to
trivially separate their

00:48:42.620 --> 00:48:45.620
variables from the rest of the
graph, and it's just tedious

00:48:45.620 --> 00:48:47.690
to try to keep them in
the explanation.

00:48:47.690 --> 00:48:51.490
So we're only talking about
state-edges here.

00:48:51.490 --> 00:48:58.370
All right, once I've done
that, let me now do my

00:48:58.370 --> 00:48:59.620
agglomeration trick.

00:49:06.330 --> 00:49:13.070
Sorry, I'm trying to draw a
dotted line around a part of

00:49:13.070 --> 00:49:17.930
the graph that I'm going to
leave outside the external

00:49:17.930 --> 00:49:20.220
variables that I still
want to be external.

00:49:20.220 --> 00:49:26.570
I'm going to leave the state
variables, which I'm going to

00:49:26.570 --> 00:49:28.120
remember were once connected.

00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:30.930
And let me reconnect them now.

00:49:30.930 --> 00:49:35.150
So I'm taking my original graph
and I'm dividing it

00:49:35.150 --> 00:49:38.550
according to this cut-set
into two parts.

00:49:41.230 --> 00:49:45.390
And I'm arbitrarily going to
call this the past, p--

00:49:45.390 --> 00:49:47.720
arbitrarily but suggestively--

00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:48.580
and the future, f.

00:49:48.580 --> 00:49:52.490
And it doesn't matter which one
I call p and which one f.

00:49:55.654 --> 00:50:01.600
And I'm going to redraw this,
so this is just a re-drawing

00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:05.260
of that in a nicer form.

00:50:05.260 --> 00:50:09.000
I'm going to aggregate all of
these variables over here.

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:12.140
And I'm going to call that
the set of past external

00:50:12.140 --> 00:50:14.855
variables, y projected
on the past.

00:50:17.365 --> 00:50:20.930
And similarly over here, I'll
get the set of all external

00:50:20.930 --> 00:50:24.080
variables projected
on the future.

00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:27.680
It was just the ones that occur
when I make this kind of

00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:29.840
cut through state edges.

00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:32.750
Some of the external variables
wind up in the past side, and

00:50:32.750 --> 00:50:34.870
some wind up connected
to the future side.

00:50:34.870 --> 00:50:38.810
But there are obviously none
connected to both because the

00:50:38.810 --> 00:50:39.860
definition of a cut-set.

00:50:39.860 --> 00:50:42.320
We've disconnected the graph.

00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:43.660
All right, so there's
the past.

00:50:43.660 --> 00:50:45.620
There's the future.

00:50:45.620 --> 00:50:50.050
And here are the state
variables.

00:50:50.050 --> 00:50:55.190
Now I'm going to define these
all together as a super-state

00:50:55.190 --> 00:51:00.250
space as I did in the trellis
graph over there.

00:51:00.250 --> 00:51:05.770
So let's see, here I labeled the
edges by a set of states.

00:51:05.770 --> 00:51:10.690
But what I mean here is that the
super-state space is just

00:51:10.690 --> 00:51:13.385
the product of the component
state spaces.

00:51:16.100 --> 00:51:29.570
It's elements s chi are just the
set of sj, j, and sigma-j,

00:51:29.570 --> 00:51:32.300
is that clear?

00:51:32.300 --> 00:51:35.040
In other words, I have a
vector of states here.

00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:39.820
And I consider the super-state
space to be just the

00:51:39.820 --> 00:51:40.400
Cartesian--

00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:42.340
this, again, is the Cartesian
product of

00:51:42.340 --> 00:51:45.260
all the state spaces.

00:51:45.260 --> 00:51:49.930
OK, and then I have
constraints.

00:51:49.930 --> 00:51:54.160
So we'll call this the aggregate
past constraint, and

00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:55.560
the aggregate future
constraint.

00:51:58.580 --> 00:52:01.050
This constrains these variables
in this state.

00:52:01.050 --> 00:52:03.471
This constrains these variables
in that state.

00:52:06.060 --> 00:52:08.790
OK, so that's where figure
5 comes from.

00:52:08.790 --> 00:52:12.500
Every year, people say, how
did you get figure 5?

00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:13.880
That's how I get figure 5.

00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:15.400
Is there any confusion
about that?

00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:22.190
Today I've been talking about
agglomeration quite a bit, so

00:52:22.190 --> 00:52:25.220
maybe this year it'll
come through better

00:52:25.220 --> 00:52:27.348
than in past years.

00:52:27.348 --> 00:52:28.286
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:28.286 --> 00:52:30.631
that we see projected on it.

00:52:30.631 --> 00:52:33.450
Or is it just--

00:52:33.450 --> 00:52:36.640
PROFESSOR: It's just the
aggregate of all these

00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:38.490
constraints.

00:52:38.490 --> 00:52:39.770
What does this say?

00:52:39.770 --> 00:52:42.830
It's the set of all the possible
values of these

00:52:42.830 --> 00:52:46.120
variables, and these variables
that can actually occur.

00:52:46.120 --> 00:52:49.670
That forms a linear space which
we call little code.

00:52:49.670 --> 00:52:53.580
Anything consistent with that
satisfies this constraint.

00:52:53.580 --> 00:52:55.270
Anything else doesn't.

00:52:55.270 --> 00:52:57.745
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:57.745 --> 00:53:04.180
for the c's projection of
the code on the past?

00:53:04.180 --> 00:53:06.390
PROFESSOR: No.

00:53:06.390 --> 00:53:10.770
The projection of the code on
the past would be you realize

00:53:10.770 --> 00:53:14.140
the code and you just project
onto these variables here.

00:53:14.140 --> 00:53:16.450
So no, this is just an index.

00:53:16.450 --> 00:53:19.590
This is a constraint whose
index is the past.

00:53:23.170 --> 00:53:27.400
OK, well, all right.

00:53:27.400 --> 00:53:31.590
Oh, but this looks like
a trellis, like

00:53:31.590 --> 00:53:32.940
a two-section trellis.

00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:34.845
It looks very much like
this thing right here.

00:53:37.370 --> 00:53:40.600
It has the same general form.

00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:46.600
And we can think of this
super-state variable here, it

00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:50.130
sort of has the Markov
property.

00:53:50.130 --> 00:53:55.910
It, again, tells everything
about the past that is needed

00:53:55.910 --> 00:53:59.090
to specify what possible
futures there could be.

00:53:59.090 --> 00:54:01.670
We're really interested in these
up here, eventually.

00:54:01.670 --> 00:54:04.850
But this is the whole set of
constraints that determine the

00:54:04.850 --> 00:54:07.160
futures along with-- there
may be some more free

00:54:07.160 --> 00:54:08.760
variables over here.

00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:13.030
But these are the constraints
we get from this half of the

00:54:13.030 --> 00:54:16.930
code on this half of the
code and vice versa.

00:54:16.930 --> 00:54:23.915
So again, a cut-set is related
to a Markov property.

00:54:28.450 --> 00:54:31.620
Let me try to state this
property more explicitly.

00:54:36.990 --> 00:54:43.310
The code by the behavioral
realization is simply the set

00:54:43.310 --> 00:54:44.680
of all combinations of --

00:54:47.370 --> 00:54:59.460
let me say, the behavior is the
set of all past states and

00:54:59.460 --> 00:55:03.155
futures that satisfy
the constraints.

00:55:13.090 --> 00:55:17.960
OK, so this gives me a certain
set of pasts that are

00:55:17.960 --> 00:55:22.850
consistent with each possible
value of the state variable.

00:55:22.850 --> 00:55:30.180
Let's call that y projected on
the past that's consistent

00:55:30.180 --> 00:55:33.850
with a particular value of
the state variable, the

00:55:33.850 --> 00:55:38.280
super-state, the vector
of states here.

00:55:38.280 --> 00:55:42.200
And these are the ones in the
future that are consistent

00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:43.450
with that state variable.

00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:51.640
We define that so the set of all
possible past and future

00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:55.362
y's is simply this Cartesian
product.

00:55:55.362 --> 00:55:57.760
And we say that in a more
graph theoretic way.

00:55:57.760 --> 00:56:02.990
If I specify the state here as
some particular value, sx, and

00:56:02.990 --> 00:56:06.920
I fix that, I've really
disconnected the graph.

00:56:10.940 --> 00:56:14.920
For a fixed sx, I can just
put that over here,

00:56:14.920 --> 00:56:16.170
put that over here.

00:56:18.790 --> 00:56:22.640
And this realizes, this
connected graph that realizes

00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:27.710
the Cartesian product of
whatever -- yp of sx.

00:56:27.710 --> 00:56:34.890
This just comes through and
affects that with yf of sx.

00:56:34.890 --> 00:56:38.550
So for any particular value of
the state, I have a certain

00:56:38.550 --> 00:56:43.190
Cartesian product of pasts and
futures they can occur.

00:56:43.190 --> 00:56:47.010
Any past that's connected with
that state can be connected to

00:56:47.010 --> 00:56:49.790
any future that's connected
with this state.

00:56:49.790 --> 00:56:52.520
All the possible future
continuations of any

00:56:52.520 --> 00:56:55.650
particular past in
this equivalence

00:56:55.650 --> 00:56:58.950
class are the same.

00:56:58.950 --> 00:57:01.110
This should sound very much like
the kinds of things we

00:57:01.110 --> 00:57:03.850
were talking about when we did
the state space theorem.

00:57:07.750 --> 00:57:11.172
And we get a sort of state space
theorem out of this.

00:57:25.070 --> 00:57:30.860
Just to draw this out, we kind
of get a two section trellis

00:57:30.860 --> 00:57:40.270
realization where we have the
various states in the state

00:57:40.270 --> 00:57:45.300
space here, s0, s1,
and so forth.

00:57:45.300 --> 00:57:49.370
We have the pasts that
are connected with

00:57:49.370 --> 00:57:52.025
s0, s1, and so forth.

00:57:59.770 --> 00:58:05.610
And we have the futures that
are connected to s0, s1.

00:58:14.790 --> 00:58:18.790
So we could get from this,
this picture of the two

00:58:18.790 --> 00:58:20.040
sectioned trellis.

00:58:22.180 --> 00:58:25.700
This really represents a set of
parallel transitions here.

00:58:25.700 --> 00:58:30.440
These are all the possible pasts
that are consistent with

00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:31.110
that state.

00:58:31.110 --> 00:58:32.560
These are all the
futures that are

00:58:32.560 --> 00:58:33.940
consistent with that state.

00:58:33.940 --> 00:58:38.470
We can tie them together, and
that realizes the code.

00:58:38.470 --> 00:58:45.150
I should say explicitly, the
code now is the union over the

00:58:45.150 --> 00:58:54.226
states in the state space, the
super-state space of the pasts

00:58:54.226 --> 00:58:59.135
there times the futures.

00:58:59.135 --> 00:59:00.570
They're consistent
with the state.

00:59:00.570 --> 00:59:02.450
So it's a union of Cartesian
products.

00:59:05.420 --> 00:59:08.016
And that's expressed
by this diagram.

00:59:08.016 --> 00:59:08.965
This is one of them.

00:59:08.965 --> 00:59:10.550
This is another one.

00:59:10.550 --> 00:59:12.250
These are all of them.

00:59:12.250 --> 00:59:13.260
How many are there?

00:59:13.260 --> 00:59:16.910
The size of the super state
variable, which by the way is

00:59:16.910 --> 00:59:20.200
the product of the sizes of the
state spaces of each of

00:59:20.200 --> 00:59:23.150
these individual state spaces
that I had coming across here.

00:59:27.770 --> 00:59:29.020
OK.

00:59:30.910 --> 00:59:35.025
What's the cut-set bound then?

00:59:35.025 --> 00:59:37.930
For linear codes, it's basically
the same as the

00:59:37.930 --> 00:59:39.180
state space theorem.

00:59:49.700 --> 01:00:01.590
The state space theorem said
that the dimension of the

01:00:01.590 --> 01:00:05.130
state space at any time -- well,
let me consider now this

01:00:05.130 --> 01:00:07.462
state space, the super-state
variable.

01:00:07.462 --> 01:00:11.050
The dimension of this
super-state variable has got

01:00:11.050 --> 01:00:15.620
to be greater than or equal to
the dimension of the code that

01:00:15.620 --> 01:00:21.630
we're realizing minus the
dimension of the --

01:00:21.630 --> 01:00:23.760
this is going to be
bad notation now.

01:00:26.530 --> 01:00:29.850
Now I mean the sub-code, so I
should have written something

01:00:29.850 --> 01:00:31.300
else for the constraint here.

01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:39.310
Minus the dimension of the
sub-code whose support is

01:00:39.310 --> 01:00:42.550
entirely on the past, minus the
dimension of the sub-code

01:00:42.550 --> 01:00:45.260
whose support is entirely
on the future.

01:00:45.260 --> 01:00:46.750
And the state space
theorem still

01:00:46.750 --> 01:00:51.285
applies for this partition.

01:00:51.285 --> 01:00:59.490
So that gives me a lower bound
on the total dimension of the

01:00:59.490 --> 01:01:02.220
states in any cut-set.

01:01:10.060 --> 01:01:23.410
So for example, in the 8, 4
code, suppose we have any

01:01:23.410 --> 01:01:38.570
realization, so some graph here,
and any cut-set such

01:01:38.570 --> 01:01:41.420
that the size of --

01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:48.475
I should say the dimension.

01:01:48.475 --> 01:01:52.940
I really mean that there are
four external variables in the

01:01:52.940 --> 01:01:54.730
past and in the future.

01:01:54.730 --> 01:01:59.340
This is dimension, dimension.

01:01:59.340 --> 01:02:03.410
In other words, we have four
variables sticking out here,

01:02:03.410 --> 01:02:07.260
and four variables sticking out
here, and we have a cut

01:02:07.260 --> 01:02:09.510
set somehow going
through there.

01:02:12.030 --> 01:02:17.520
So our picture now is going to
look something like this.

01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:23.050
What's the minimum possible
dimension of the total

01:02:23.050 --> 01:02:28.350
dimension of the edges that
cross this cut-set, the state

01:02:28.350 --> 01:02:30.240
spaces that are in
this cut-set.

01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:31.870
We know this code
very well now.

01:02:37.290 --> 01:02:38.450
Let's do the Muder bound.

01:02:38.450 --> 01:02:40.170
What's the maximum dimension?

01:02:40.170 --> 01:02:41.920
The dimension of
the code is 4.

01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:47.690
What's the maximum dimension
of any code that

01:02:47.690 --> 01:02:51.090
lives on the past?

01:02:51.090 --> 01:02:53.050
It's 1, because such
a code has to have

01:02:53.050 --> 01:02:54.490
minimum distance 4.

01:02:54.490 --> 01:02:58.590
So it can't have dimension
greater than the repetition

01:02:58.590 --> 01:03:00.560
code of length 4.

01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:05.410
So 4 minus 1, same argument
for the future, equals 2.

01:03:08.550 --> 01:03:13.470
So it says that however you do
it, you're going to have to

01:03:13.470 --> 01:03:18.110
have at least two binary edges
or one quaternary edge

01:03:18.110 --> 01:03:23.390
crossing a cut-set that divides
the external variables

01:03:23.390 --> 01:03:24.820
into two equal sized parts.

01:03:30.180 --> 01:03:32.770
So let's go further.

01:03:32.770 --> 01:03:37.550
Let's suppose we want
a cycle-free graph.

01:03:37.550 --> 01:03:40.805
OK, if we have a cycle-free
graph, then all of the

01:03:40.805 --> 01:03:43.640
cut-sets are single edges.

01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:49.165
All right, so in a cycle-free
graph, when we make a cut,

01:03:49.165 --> 01:03:50.910
it's through a single edge.

01:03:50.910 --> 01:03:56.000
And we're saying the state space
if there's a way you can

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.570
make a cut that divides this
into two equal parts, the

01:03:58.570 --> 01:04:02.000
state space has to have
dimension 2, it has to have

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.800
size 4 for any cycle-free
graph.

01:04:12.650 --> 01:04:17.580
Similarly, if we have the 24,
12, 8 code, we've proved that

01:04:17.580 --> 01:04:24.500
the minimum dimension of
any central cut has

01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:28.820
to be at least 6.

01:04:28.820 --> 01:04:31.630
No, in the center, it has
to be at least 8, right?

01:04:37.870 --> 01:04:45.910
Yeah, because the dimension of
the code is 12, and a sub-code

01:04:45.910 --> 01:04:49.810
that has support on 12 can't
have dimension more than 2.

01:04:49.810 --> 01:04:52.250
This can't have dimension
more than 2.

01:04:52.250 --> 01:04:54.140
So that would be 8.

01:04:54.140 --> 01:05:01.090
So for the 24, 12, 8 code, the
set of edges that cross the

01:05:01.090 --> 01:05:05.080
cut have to have total
dimension at least 8.

01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:08.720
And if we want it to be cycle
free, then there has to be a

01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:11.381
single edge that has
dimension 8.

01:05:14.090 --> 01:05:30.293
So the general conclusions --

01:05:37.930 --> 01:05:40.890
we first talked about trellis
realizations.

01:05:40.890 --> 01:05:45.940
We can generalize that any
cycle-free realization--

01:05:45.940 --> 01:05:50.690
and we're going to see that we
have strong motivation to keep

01:05:50.690 --> 01:05:55.180
our realization cycle-free,
because then we can do exact

01:05:55.180 --> 01:05:58.080
maximum likelihood decoding.

01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:02.610
So we'd like to have cycle-free
realizations.

01:06:02.610 --> 01:06:05.450
But what have we just seen?

01:06:05.450 --> 01:06:23.180
We've just seen that the state
complexity cannot be less than

01:06:23.180 --> 01:06:40.120
that of a trellis realization
with a comparable cut.

01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:44.220
In other words, one that divides
the past and future in

01:06:44.220 --> 01:06:47.670
the same way, divides the
external variables

01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:51.720
into the same size.

01:06:51.720 --> 01:06:55.960
OK, so we really can't beat the
trellis bounds, the Muder

01:06:55.960 --> 01:06:59.240
bound, in particular.

01:06:59.240 --> 01:07:02.520
Now again, there's some
games we can play.

01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:06.365
Let's ask about the
24, 12, 8 cut.

01:07:06.365 --> 01:07:11.230
We've said if we want to realize
it with the cycle-free

01:07:11.230 --> 01:07:16.750
realization, this says, well, if
we have a cut that divides

01:07:16.750 --> 01:07:23.390
the external variables into
two parts of size 8, then

01:07:23.390 --> 01:07:26.510
we're going to be stuck with a
state space of dimension 8 and

01:07:26.510 --> 01:07:28.490
a size 256.

01:07:28.490 --> 01:07:31.610
No way around it.

01:07:31.610 --> 01:07:36.700
Here's a slight way around it.

01:07:36.700 --> 01:07:39.860
Let me hypothesize
a realization

01:07:39.860 --> 01:07:41.110
that looks like this.

01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:50.380
This is a 14, 7 code.

01:07:50.380 --> 01:07:52.490
So is this.

01:07:52.490 --> 01:07:54.475
So is this.

01:07:54.475 --> 01:07:59.160
We're going to divide the
external variables into three

01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:01.330
parts, each of size 8.

01:08:07.790 --> 01:08:12.210
And we're going to have three
internal state spaces, each of

01:08:12.210 --> 01:08:13.780
dimension 6.

01:08:13.780 --> 01:08:17.959
And we're going to constrain
those by an 18, 9 code.

01:08:17.959 --> 01:08:22.069
And again, these all have rate
1/2 because this code is dual.

01:08:22.069 --> 01:08:24.750
Now, is there anything in what
I've done that prevents this

01:08:24.750 --> 01:08:26.000
kind of realization?

01:08:28.710 --> 01:08:30.020
Let's test the cut-sets.

01:08:30.020 --> 01:08:31.689
Where are the cut-sets in--

01:08:31.689 --> 01:08:34.330
well, A, is this cycle-free
realization?

01:08:34.330 --> 01:08:37.500
Yes, OK, good.

01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:38.819
Let's test the cut-sets.

01:08:38.819 --> 01:08:42.229
It's kind of a three-way
symmetrical thing.

01:08:42.229 --> 01:08:46.689
The internal cut-sets are
here, here, and here.

01:08:46.689 --> 01:08:52.590
Each of these cut-sets divides
the coordinates into one set

01:08:52.590 --> 01:08:55.255
of size 8 and one
set of size 16.

01:08:57.899 --> 01:09:01.550
In that case, what does the
Muder bound give us?

01:09:01.550 --> 01:09:04.590
In that case, 8, 16, the
dimension of the

01:09:04.590 --> 01:09:06.450
code is still 12.

01:09:06.450 --> 01:09:10.850
The minimum dimension of a code
of length 16 and minimum

01:09:10.850 --> 01:09:13.370
distance 8 is 5.

01:09:13.370 --> 01:09:18.010
And one of length 8 and minimum
distance 8 is 1.

01:09:18.010 --> 01:09:22.950
So as we did on the homework, we
find that we are permitted

01:09:22.950 --> 01:09:24.399
to have a state space--

01:09:24.399 --> 01:09:28.100
the minimal state space here
could have dimension 6.

01:09:28.100 --> 01:09:31.180
So this possibly could occur.

01:09:31.180 --> 01:09:32.979
Again, we're kind of
camouflaging some

01:09:32.979 --> 01:09:34.300
of the state space.

01:09:34.300 --> 01:09:36.870
You see there is no central
state space in this.

01:09:36.870 --> 01:09:40.670
There is no cut-set that
partitions it into 12 and 12.

01:09:40.670 --> 01:09:43.529
So by being a little bit clever,
we've got it down to

01:09:43.529 --> 01:09:48.069
something where instead of a 256
central state space, we've

01:09:48.069 --> 01:09:52.100
got three 64 state spaces.

01:09:52.100 --> 01:09:54.795
And this is what we saw on the
trellis realization too, that

01:09:54.795 --> 01:09:59.250
if we sectionalize into three
sections, then we get a 64

01:09:59.250 --> 01:10:03.180
state and a 64 state at the
boundaries between the three

01:10:03.180 --> 01:10:07.580
sections, but we still got the
same 512 branch complexity in

01:10:07.580 --> 01:10:08.540
the middle.

01:10:08.540 --> 01:10:09.450
And what do you know?

01:10:09.450 --> 01:10:11.550
We still have a constraint
code with

01:10:11.550 --> 01:10:14.090
complexity 512 here, too.

01:10:14.090 --> 01:10:16.870
So if you consider that the
more valid measure of

01:10:16.870 --> 01:10:20.030
complexity, the minimum
dimension of any constraint

01:10:20.030 --> 01:10:24.360
code or branch space, then
we haven't improved.

01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:28.510
So subject to these qualifiers,
this is a pretty

01:10:28.510 --> 01:10:32.380
strong argument that by going
beyond trellis realizations to

01:10:32.380 --> 01:10:41.090
general cycle-free, graphical
realizations, we

01:10:41.090 --> 01:10:44.212
can't gain very much.

01:10:44.212 --> 01:10:50.470
So the moral is to significantly
reduce

01:10:50.470 --> 01:10:55.206
complexity, we're going
to need to go

01:10:55.206 --> 01:10:56.465
to graphs with cycles.

01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:07.870
We must go to graphs
with cycles.

01:11:15.910 --> 01:11:22.360
OK, so you don't get much
for free in this life.

01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:24.805
So when we get to our
sum-product decoding

01:11:24.805 --> 01:11:27.060
algorithm, we're going to have
to apply it to graphs with

01:11:27.060 --> 01:11:30.340
cycles where it's iterative,
where it's not exact, where

01:11:30.340 --> 01:11:34.920
it's just a lot less nice.

01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:37.210
So what do we do when we go
to graphs with cycles?

01:11:37.210 --> 01:11:39.470
Where is the potential gain?

01:11:39.470 --> 01:11:45.740
The potential gain is that now
this super-state variable

01:11:45.740 --> 01:11:52.680
could be made up of a number
of simpler variables.

01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:55.820
We've got a certain minimum
dimension that we're going to

01:11:55.820 --> 01:12:02.265
need any cut-set, like 8 for the
central state space of the

01:12:02.265 --> 01:12:03.300
Golay code.

01:12:03.300 --> 01:12:09.290
But now we can spread it
around over two or more

01:12:09.290 --> 01:12:11.630
sub-state variables.

01:12:11.630 --> 01:12:16.260
So for instance, maybe we can
find something where we now

01:12:16.260 --> 01:12:21.220
have a graph with cycles where
we have two state spaces here.

01:12:21.220 --> 01:12:23.740
Here's the cycle again.

01:12:23.740 --> 01:12:28.880
And the two state spaces
each have size only 16.

01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:33.190
That would still satisfy
this cut-set bound.

01:12:33.190 --> 01:12:41.260
So we greatly reduce the size of
the state spaces, which is

01:12:41.260 --> 01:12:44.730
exponential in their dimension,
but at the cost of

01:12:44.730 --> 01:12:45.720
introducing a cycle.

01:12:45.720 --> 01:12:47.560
I insist that's a cycle.

01:12:47.560 --> 01:12:49.510
Let's go over to this
trellis here.

01:12:49.510 --> 01:12:53.930
The next thing I might talk
about is tail-biting trellis

01:12:53.930 --> 01:12:55.180
realizations.

01:13:00.100 --> 01:13:01.370
This is very simple.

01:13:01.370 --> 01:13:05.480
What's the first realization you
would think of on a graph

01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:07.490
with a cycle?

01:13:07.490 --> 01:13:10.750
Well, here's a trellis
realization.

01:13:10.750 --> 01:13:12.370
It's always going to
look like this.

01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:18.074
And then let's just
loop this around.

01:13:18.074 --> 01:13:21.380
In other words, we make the last
state space equal to the

01:13:21.380 --> 01:13:22.450
first state space.

01:13:22.450 --> 01:13:25.090
We don't require they used
to be trivial state

01:13:25.090 --> 01:13:27.040
spaces of size 1.

01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:29.710
We allow them to have
some dimension.

01:13:29.710 --> 01:13:32.860
And here's a potential
realization on a

01:13:32.860 --> 01:13:34.110
graph with a cycle.

01:13:38.150 --> 01:13:39.920
Cut-sets.

01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:41.600
Where are the cut-sets
in this graph?

01:13:44.288 --> 01:13:47.720
Well, the cut-sets now
look like that.

01:13:47.720 --> 01:13:49.460
All the cut-sets involve
at least two

01:13:49.460 --> 01:13:52.450
edges, two state spaces.

01:13:52.450 --> 01:13:54.840
OK, so we potentially might
get this kind of benefit.

01:13:58.330 --> 01:14:00.850
Here's an example.

01:14:00.850 --> 01:14:06.660
Suppose instead, go back to
our very favorite example,

01:14:06.660 --> 01:14:13.680
suppose we let u2 go across
here, and we bring out u3 out

01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:18.220
of here, and we bring it all
the way back to here.

01:14:21.870 --> 01:14:24.540
Everything still good?

01:14:24.540 --> 01:14:28.050
It's obviously another
realization.

01:14:28.050 --> 01:14:31.140
Now I've made it clear that
when I draw u2 and u3

01:14:31.140 --> 01:14:34.240
separately here, I've
really got a cycle.

01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:35.490
I've made a big cycle.

01:14:38.130 --> 01:14:42.960
And now what's the number of
states in this two-section

01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:46.680
realization of the 8, 4 code?

01:14:46.680 --> 01:14:49.090
This is a two-state tail-biting
trellis, because

01:14:49.090 --> 01:14:51.440
each of these is just a little
binary variable.

01:14:57.770 --> 01:14:59.970
So I get some kind of
two-state trellis.

01:14:59.970 --> 01:15:03.330
If I were actually to draw out
the trellis, I would have two

01:15:03.330 --> 01:15:10.086
states at time 0, two states
at time 4, some kind of --

01:15:10.086 --> 01:15:11.150
what have I got--

01:15:11.150 --> 01:15:11.800
6, 3.

01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:16.210
So I've got 8 branches that go
back and forth, a couple of

01:15:16.210 --> 01:15:17.250
parallel branches.

01:15:17.250 --> 01:15:18.780
It's going to look like that.

01:15:21.680 --> 01:15:26.940
Then same thing out to time 8.

01:15:26.940 --> 01:15:28.090
I don't have a time 8.

01:15:28.090 --> 01:15:37.000
This is really time 0 again,
where I identify these two

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:37.920
state spaces.

01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:45.130
This is really the same state as
this, and this is the same

01:15:45.130 --> 01:15:47.240
one as that.

01:15:47.240 --> 01:15:50.790
So that's if I really drew out
the trellis in the style I

01:15:50.790 --> 01:15:55.400
originally drew trellises,
this would be a

01:15:55.400 --> 01:15:57.670
picture of all the--

01:15:57.670 --> 01:16:00.090
there's a 1-to-1 map between
all the paths through this

01:16:00.090 --> 01:16:03.970
trellis that start and end in
the same state, because that's

01:16:03.970 --> 01:16:07.340
what I mean when I identify the
beginning and end states.

01:16:07.340 --> 01:16:13.170
So if I start in this state,
there's a four-way branch

01:16:13.170 --> 01:16:17.510
here, another four-way
branch there.

01:16:17.510 --> 01:16:19.370
Is that right?

01:16:19.370 --> 01:16:21.820
No, there's only a two-way
branch such that I can get

01:16:21.820 --> 01:16:22.745
back to the initial state.

01:16:22.745 --> 01:16:26.870
So there are 8 possible paths
that start here and get back

01:16:26.870 --> 01:16:30.120
to the same state, 8 possible
paths that start out from here

01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:32.030
and get back to the
same state.

01:16:32.030 --> 01:16:39.820
And they together correspond
1-to-1 to all the code words.

01:16:39.820 --> 01:16:42.430
OK, well, that's not
a very big deal.

01:16:42.430 --> 01:16:44.960
I was able to reduce a
four-state trellis to a

01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:46.210
two-state trellis.

01:16:48.990 --> 01:16:54.145
But suppose I do the same thing
with the Golay code.

01:16:54.145 --> 01:16:58.080
In the Golay code, there's a
very beautiful tail-biting

01:16:58.080 --> 01:16:59.410
trellis realization.

01:17:02.410 --> 01:17:03.710
It looks like this.

01:17:03.710 --> 01:17:09.440
It has 12 sections, so maybe I
won't draw all the sections.

01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:19.110
It groups each of the output
variables into pairs and comes

01:17:19.110 --> 01:17:20.710
around like that.

01:17:20.710 --> 01:17:26.860
And each of these state spaces
has dimension 4, or size 16.

01:17:26.860 --> 01:17:30.860
And I give the generator matrix
for this in the notes.

01:17:30.860 --> 01:17:42.350
So this is for the 24, 12, 8
code, and now you test me.

01:17:42.350 --> 01:17:43.600
Is this a possible--

01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:48.090
use the cut-set bound.

01:17:48.090 --> 01:17:50.130
See if this violates the
cut-set bound anywhere.

01:17:50.130 --> 01:17:52.210
Does it for this code?

01:17:55.416 --> 01:17:56.620
No, it doesn't.

01:17:56.620 --> 01:18:00.310
Because every cut-set, no matter
how I draw it, we're

01:18:00.310 --> 01:18:03.950
going to get two edges, each
with dimension 4, adding up to

01:18:03.950 --> 01:18:06.580
a super-state of dimension 8.

01:18:06.580 --> 01:18:12.430
And the state spaces at all the
even times, notice I've

01:18:12.430 --> 01:18:15.900
sectionalized here, so I only
need to look at even times.

01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:20.420
The state spaces at all even
times in this code could have

01:18:20.420 --> 01:18:24.430
dimensions as small as 8.

01:18:24.430 --> 01:18:27.760
Remember, at the odd times,
they go up to 9.

01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:30.090
And these are all little--

01:18:30.090 --> 01:18:33.830
4, 4-- these are all
little 10, 5 codes.

01:18:33.830 --> 01:18:37.612
So the branch complexity
is only 32.

01:18:37.612 --> 01:18:40.520
So this is very much simpler
than any of the conventional

01:18:40.520 --> 01:18:42.370
trellises that I've--

01:18:42.370 --> 01:18:44.480
than the minimal conventional
trellis that we were able to

01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:46.210
draw for this code.

01:18:46.210 --> 01:18:49.490
Or if this funny little pinwheel
with three arms on

01:18:49.490 --> 01:18:53.540
it, which is also a cycle-free
realization, this code.

01:18:53.540 --> 01:18:56.760
OK, so they're going
to tail-biting.

01:18:56.760 --> 01:19:01.080
That's a significant advance.

01:19:01.080 --> 01:19:03.500
An aside note--

01:19:03.500 --> 01:19:11.040
if we just break this, it turns
out we have a generator

01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:16.990
matrix that has period 4, and
let this go on infinitely,

01:19:16.990 --> 01:19:31.310
this is a realization of a rate
1/2, 16 state, branch

01:19:31.310 --> 01:19:34.810
complexity 32, as we expect--

01:19:34.810 --> 01:19:37.160
perfectly conventional,
except it's

01:19:37.160 --> 01:19:38.605
periodically time varying--

01:19:45.390 --> 01:19:51.310
linear convolutional code with
absolutely phenomenal

01:19:51.310 --> 01:19:53.470
performance.

01:19:53.470 --> 01:19:57.760
Like the Golay code,
it has d equals 8.

01:19:57.760 --> 01:20:03.620
Therefore it has a nominal
coding gain of 4, 1/2

01:20:03.620 --> 01:20:05.890
times 8, or 6 dB.

01:20:05.890 --> 01:20:08.860
This is with only a 16
state, rate 1/2 code.

01:20:08.860 --> 01:20:10.600
Look at the ones on the table.

01:20:10.600 --> 01:20:13.910
This is significantly
better than that.

01:20:13.910 --> 01:20:17.930
And it's effective coding
gain, I forget.

01:20:17.930 --> 01:20:22.720
But it's still very good,
excellent, for the complexity

01:20:22.720 --> 01:20:24.370
of this code.

01:20:24.370 --> 01:20:28.405
So this is called the Golay
convolutional code.

01:20:36.710 --> 01:20:41.510
And it's an interesting example
of the interplay

01:20:41.510 --> 01:20:44.360
between this block coding stuff
and the convolutional

01:20:44.360 --> 01:20:47.060
coding stuff, in this case.

01:20:47.060 --> 01:20:49.320
Actually this code was first
discovered in computer

01:20:49.320 --> 01:20:52.710
searches, but nobody realized
how wonderful it was.

01:20:52.710 --> 01:20:55.170
And it was only when its
connection with this Golay

01:20:55.170 --> 01:20:58.990
code was recognized that people
realized this was

01:20:58.990 --> 01:21:03.530
really a special code, both
from a performance versus

01:21:03.530 --> 01:21:07.550
complexity point of view,
and also algebraically.

01:21:07.550 --> 01:21:09.840
OK, well that brings
us to the end.

01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:13.645
There's actually one more style
of graph realization

01:21:13.645 --> 01:21:17.700
that I want to mention to you,
for the Reed-Muller codes.

01:21:17.700 --> 01:21:21.210
We know that they're basically
based on Hadamard transforms.

01:21:21.210 --> 01:21:25.760
It's a very nice kind of Fourier
transform like graph

01:21:25.760 --> 01:21:28.180
realization of Hadamard
transforms.

01:21:28.180 --> 01:21:31.360
So that gives us another style
of realization of Reed-Muller

01:21:31.360 --> 01:21:35.210
codes that again, we can
aggregate to lead to a lot of

01:21:35.210 --> 01:21:39.000
nice structures.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:45.160
Again, at the end of the day,
unless we allow cycles, we

01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:47.090
don't really gain anything.

01:21:47.090 --> 01:21:51.260
So I'll do that the first part
of next time and then do the

01:21:51.260 --> 01:21:52.846
sum-product algorithm.

01:21:52.846 --> 01:21:55.380
I hope I can do it
in one lecture.
