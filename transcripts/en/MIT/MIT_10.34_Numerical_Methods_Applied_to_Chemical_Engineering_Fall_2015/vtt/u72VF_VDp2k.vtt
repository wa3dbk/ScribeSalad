JAMES SWAN: OK, shall we begin?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.450
So on the syllabus,
today's class

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.580
is supposed to be a
review for the next quiz.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.540
And I'm happy to answer
any questions you

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.350
have about the material
or about the quiz

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.120
to the best of my ability.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.270
And when we've exhausted
those questions,

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.679
I have some notes on
another method for solving

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:50.970
partial differential equations.

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:52.428
We didn't really
cover it in class,

00:00:52.428 --> 00:00:54.690
but I think it's quite
interesting and applicable

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.210
for chemical engineers
in particular

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.490
because of the classes of
problems that we study.

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:04.830
And then notes on how to
construct a simulation of a PDE

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.920
that follow from what
Professor Green discussed

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.160
during your last PDE lecture.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.570
And we'll do an example
where we actually

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.120
develop a code to solve
the PDE and maybe refine it

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.440
so that it runs more
quickly by noticing

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.760
certain things about the
structure of the problem.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.010
OK?

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:24.990
I have your gift cards.

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.590
I remembered them.

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.010
So I'll hand those out at the
end the class, just in case

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.840
more people trickle in.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.250
But it doesn't look like
there's 53 people here,

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.591
so maybe the TAs are going to
be eating burritos for a while.

00:01:36.591 --> 00:01:38.090
There's going to
be a lot left over.

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.800
We'll see.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.790
I'll hold onto them.

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.190
Try to make sure everyone
gets their reward

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.730
for responding to
the class survey.

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.970
So let's start with questions
about the quiz, about

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.930
the material that we've
covered up to this point.

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.590
I'm really going to leave it
to you to point out things

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.230
that you feel like
you need help with,

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:02.550
you think need to be reviewed.

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.130
I know you've had a review
session with the TAs already.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.833
Maybe that's been sufficient.

00:02:06.833 --> 00:02:07.720
OK?

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.865
Questions.

00:02:09.865 --> 00:02:10.490
It's up to you.

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.990
Yeah.

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.392
AUDIENCE: Will the test contain
chemical engineering material

00:02:14.392 --> 00:02:15.766
like last year's
test, or will it

00:02:15.766 --> 00:02:17.181
be like Professor Green's test.

00:02:17.181 --> 00:02:18.430
JAMES SWAN: Oh, good question.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.870
So I'll tell you that
I believe the problems

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.930
on the quiz this
year are motivated

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.630
by chemical engineering
problems, OK?

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.050
The reason for that is,
unlike linear algebra problems

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.540
or optimization
problems, those can

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.690
be crafted out of whole cloth.

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.260
But workable, right,
boundary value problems,

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.330
workable initial
value problems really

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.670
need to stem from
something physical.

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.390
You are not asked
to derive anything

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.850
from your extensive chemical
engineering knowledge.

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.150
This is not a qualifier
for reactors or thermo

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.900
or transport.

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.251
We provide you
with those details.

00:02:58.251 --> 00:02:58.750
OK?

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.290
But they are-- I think they
are of a chemical engineering

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:03.280
origin.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.586
So you have equations that
are reasonable to work with.

00:03:06.586 --> 00:03:08.290
OK?

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:09.100
More questions.

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:16.200
Yes.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.700
AUDIENCE: I would
love to briefly go

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.760
over some boundary value
problems, specifically

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.266
like the collocation and--

00:03:22.266 --> 00:03:22.890
JAMES SWAN: OK.

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.420
AUDIENCE: --Galerkin
methods, maybe.

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.080
JAMES SWAN: Sure.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.100
So OK.

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.245
So let's just discuss
boundary value problems first.

00:03:33.245 --> 00:03:35.877
Turns out PDEs are a class of
boundary value problem, too,

00:03:35.877 --> 00:03:37.960
largely, at least the ones
that chemical engineers

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:38.780
are interested in.

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.390
So if we understand boundary
value problems in general,

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.320
we should understand how to
solve partial differential

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.034
equations too.

00:03:46.034 --> 00:03:47.950
Many classes of partial
differential equations

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.366
that we're interested in can
also be solved in these ways.

00:03:50.366 --> 00:03:53.620
So we talked about
relaxation methods

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.610
in general, which were
these methods that

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:02.890
rely on somehow discretizing the
continuous function that we're

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.980
trying to describe in this
boundary value problem.

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.480
So usually, you've got some--

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.410
linear function,
some linear operator

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.230
that operates on some variable
that we're trying to understand

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:18.550
in a boundary value problem.

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:23.720
Maybe it's temperature,
right, equals 0.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.850
So it's going to be something
like thermal diffusion.

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:29.350
This equation could
represent that.

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.480
Could represent some
advection diffusion problem

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:32.800
in some bounded domain.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.120
Could be a PDE.

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:39.070
It could just be an ordinary
differential equation, right,

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.760
but a boundary value problem.

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.960
And with this class
of relaxation methods,

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.990
we try not to exactly
satisfy this equation.

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.450
We relax that assumption.

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:52.500
We try to somehow
discretize this function.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.510
It could be temperature,
could be energy,

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:56.200
could be velocity or momentum.

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.970
It could be lots of
different things.

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.570
Try to relax the constraint that
this is satisfied everywhere.

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:05.290
And we try to satisfy in some
approximate sense instead.

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:07.480
So we discussed
collocation methods,

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.700
where we take the domain
we're interested in

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.520
and we divide it up
into a series of points.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.050
And we try to satisfy this
equation at those points.

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.030
And we have some approximation
for the function,

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:21.700
its representation
at those points.

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:24.460
That approximation could
be a finite difference

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.530
approximation.

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:31.510
That approximation could
be a basis set expansion.

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:35.590
It could be a finite
volume approximation.

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:38.500
We could expand in terms
of local basis functions.

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.810
That's the finite
element method.

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:42.580
We covered all these
different methods.

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.344
That involves
chopping the domain up

00:05:44.344 --> 00:05:45.760
into a series of
points and trying

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:47.760
to satisfy the function
at each of those points.

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:53.729
There was an alternative method,
this sort of Galerkin method,

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:56.020
where instead of trying to
satisfy the function at each

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.390
of those points, we have
some basis set expansion.

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:02.500
So we have some
approximate representation

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:06.260
of our function in terms
of these basis sets--

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.050
in terms of this basis set.

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:09.880
And instead, we try
to make it be the case

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:18.510
that the integral
of our operator

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:20.880
applied to our approximation--

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.950
I'm going to break chalk--

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:25.500
multiplied by each of
the basis functions

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:31.870
and then integrated over this
entire domain is equal to 0.

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:37.782
So we try to satisfy this
equation with respect

00:06:37.782 --> 00:06:39.990
to each of these basis
functions, essentially, right?

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:42.120
There's some-- this isn't
going to exactly satisfy

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.184
the equation.

00:06:43.184 --> 00:06:44.225
This is an approximation.

00:06:44.225 --> 00:06:46.391
It's not going to exactly
satisfy the boundary value

00:06:46.391 --> 00:06:47.940
problem we were after.

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:50.880
But the projection
of the residual,

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.980
or how far off we are
with this operator,

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:54.850
on each of the basis
functions, we're

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:56.760
going to try to force to be 0.

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:59.250
So rather than trying to
get a pointwise solution

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:02.910
of the problem, we're going
to try to sort of smooth out

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:05.730
the error with respect
to the basis functions

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:09.000
and make this
equation is satisfied

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
as it possibly can with respect
to these basis functions.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.490
And that's the Galerkin view.

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:15.240
So it's different.

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.160
It's like you're
trying to minimize

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:20.460
sort of a global error with
respect to the basis functions,

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:23.190
as opposed to a
pointwise error, OK?

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:25.230
And again, these basis
functions can be chosen

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:26.355
in a lot of different ways.

00:07:26.355 --> 00:07:28.480
They can be chosen as
sort of global functions.

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:31.230
They can be things
like sines and cosines.

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:33.210
We may know that the
solution to this equation

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:36.060
looks a lot like sines and
cosines, so that makes sense.

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:38.350
Or we may choose local
basis functions instead,

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:41.190
little tent functions in 1D.

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:43.970
They're actually tent functions
in many dimensions as well.

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:46.530
You can imagine sort of
extending that to look

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:48.210
like a tent in many dimensions.

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:51.000
That's the finite
element method.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.860
So we can choose those basis
functions however we want.

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:57.090
And the goal is to just minimize
this residual with respect

00:07:57.090 --> 00:07:59.430
to each of the basis
functions that we include

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:01.005
in our approximate solution.

00:08:01.005 --> 00:08:04.440
And we would call that a
reasonable approximation.

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:06.450
Presumably, as the
number of basis functions

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:09.296
goes to infinity, this
is going to converge.

00:08:09.296 --> 00:08:10.920
That's the applied
mathematician's job,

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:14.070
to show us that it's going to
converge to the true solution

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:15.610
of the equations.

00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:17.450
OK?

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:20.120
So those are the
methods that we--

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:22.310
those are the methods
that we apply.

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:24.860
Good choices of basis
function are important.

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:28.100
So there was this discussion
about quantum chemistry,

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:31.760
where you're trying to
solve the Schrodinger

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:35.350
equation for n electrons,
there's 3n degrees of freedom.

00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:37.630
So a very
high-dimensional space.

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:38.929
How are you going to do that?

00:08:38.929 --> 00:08:40.640
You do it with basis
set expansions.

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:43.570
And the choice of those basis
functions is really important.

00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:45.320
So if you read a
quantum chemistry paper,

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:48.320
you'll see they give a long
series of digits and numbers

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:51.440
that are meant to indicate which
basis set expansion they used.

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.090
And for certain
classes of problem,

00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:54.590
some are better than others.

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:56.540
And they make the
problem actually

00:08:56.540 --> 00:09:00.880
solvable when it's not, if you
were to just choose your basis

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:04.800
functions without care for
the physics of the problem.

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:05.300
Sam.

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:09.960
AUDIENCE: The last homework,
in the Galerkin method,

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.830
where you multiplied
by the complex,

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:14.580
how did you get one basis
set, basis functions?

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:18.630
Where does that fit into this?

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:21.222
JAMES SWAN: Well, it should
have been right here.

00:09:21.222 --> 00:09:22.680
So technically,
the basis functions

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:24.850
don't have to be
real-valued functions.

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:26.910
They can be
complex-valued functions.

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:31.440
And then this is, in some
sense, a dot product,

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:34.950
an inner product in the space
of these basic functions.

00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:36.960
And the proper form
for an inner product

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:39.150
when we have
complex-valued things

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:41.310
is to take the real part
of one and multiply it

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:43.110
with the complex
part of another.

00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:45.780
So that should have
been right here.

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:47.760
This should be the
complex conjugate.

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:48.986
OK?

00:09:48.986 --> 00:09:49.486
Yeah.

00:09:49.486 --> 00:09:51.496
AUDIENCE: So when we
do the Galerkin method,

00:09:51.496 --> 00:09:54.810
we necessarily have to
approximate these derivatives

00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:56.430
and things using
basis functions.

00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:56.685
JAMES SWAN: Yes.

00:09:56.685 --> 00:09:58.505
AUDIENCE: But in the
collocation method,

00:09:58.505 --> 00:10:00.546
there was lots of other
ways that we could do it,

00:10:00.546 --> 00:10:01.690
like find differences.

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:02.160
I know you mentioned
a few of them earlier.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:02.970
JAMES SWAN: Yes.

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:03.916
Yes.

00:10:03.916 --> 00:10:04.790
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:05.150
JAMES SWAN: That's right.

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:07.600
AUDIENCE: That [? LOT term ?]
kind of contains also

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.560
the basis function in
the Galerkin method,

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:11.825
or in the collocation method.

00:10:11.825 --> 00:10:15.250
JAMES SWAN: Well,
in the-- if we have

00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:18.711
an expansion of the
sort of objective

00:10:18.711 --> 00:10:20.960
that we're trying to calculate
in terms of those basis

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:25.130
functions, L is
the real L, right?

00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:25.940
It is what it is.

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:28.470
This is the model
equation to be solved.

00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:33.140
We operate on our approximate
solution with the real L.

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:36.170
In the collocation method,
it may be the real L,

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:37.830
or it may be some
approximation for L.

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:40.100
If we do finite differences,
we're approximating

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:42.320
all these derivatives.

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:44.480
If we do a basis
set expansion and we

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:47.990
try to satisfy that at a
certain number of points,

00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:51.950
we're not approximating L.
We're approximating T instead.

00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:54.008
So they're a little
bit different.

00:10:57.220 --> 00:10:59.580
More questions?

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:00.810
So that's BVPs.

00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:03.300
This picture applies
for PDEs, too.

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:06.570
So this is the integral
over the domain

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:10.110
of interest, the domain
that's bounded by our boundary

00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:12.270
conditions.

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:14.711
These basis functions don't
have to be in one dimension.

00:11:14.711 --> 00:11:16.710
They can be in any number
of dimensions we want.

00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:19.860
We just want them to be good
basis functions in principle.

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:22.705
So for finite elements,
you use little tents.

00:11:22.705 --> 00:11:25.080
They're multi-dimensional
tents, but they're still tents.

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:27.810
The same as these hat
functions that Professor Green

00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:28.860
talked about in 1D.

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:30.779
Just do them in many dimensions.

00:11:30.779 --> 00:11:32.070
They work exactly the same way.

00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:33.736
They're easy to take
the derivatives of.

00:11:33.736 --> 00:11:36.730
These intervals are, for the
most part, simple to calculate.

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:41.570
And that's why COMSOL, for
example, uses that methodology.

00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:45.540
It's based on this sort
of Galerkin picture.

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:49.712
So PDEs, BVPs look very similar.

00:11:49.712 --> 00:11:51.920
Usually, when we're talking
about spatial dimensions,

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:53.640
they look very similar.

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:55.650
When we go to the
time domain, things

00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:57.600
get a little more confusing.

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:02.272
That mixes together what we
know from ODE IVPs with what

00:12:02.272 --> 00:12:03.980
we know from boundary
value problems now.

00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:05.730
So you talked about
the method of lines

00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:08.220
last time as one
way of studying,

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:11.430
for example, parabolic partial
differential equations.

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:14.400
You have the spatial
discretization like this.

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:17.970
And then in time, you have
some ODE IVP technique

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:19.490
that you integrate forward.

00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:22.470
You rely on these
robust ODE methods that

00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:24.240
know how to control
the numerical error,

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:27.420
can detect, maybe, when there's
some sort of an instability

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:32.190
and try to damp it out by
altering the time step so

00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:35.630
that things stay stable.

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:36.157
Yes?

00:12:36.157 --> 00:12:37.990
AUDIENCE: I can't
visualize the local basis.

00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:42.752
Can you give me an [INAUDIBLE]
expression for the local basis?

00:12:42.752 --> 00:12:43.460
JAMES SWAN: Sure.

00:12:49.515 --> 00:12:51.890
So first of all, there are a
lot of local basis functions

00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:53.460
we could write down, OK?

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:53.970
AUDIENCE: This is
just one of them.

00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:54.500
JAMES SWAN: There
are many of them.

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:56.310
So yes, let's do the hat.

00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:56.810
OK?

00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:06.570
Let's suppose I
have this line in x,

00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:09.630
and I target in my
collocation method

00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:13.050
a series of points, column
x i minus 1, xi, x i plus 1,

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:15.280
and they extend
well beyond here.

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:17.310
It doesn't matter
where they are.

00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:20.280
I choose where they are based
on the physics of the problem.

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:22.230
I'll put them where
I want them to go.

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:25.877
And in fact, you might even
try to optimize where they go.

00:13:25.877 --> 00:13:27.960
So you might start with
some distribution of them,

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:29.512
and then move them
around in some way

00:13:29.512 --> 00:13:31.470
to improve the quality
of your solution, right?

00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:34.060
Maybe you distribute
them uniformly at first,

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:36.060
and then you notice, oh,
my solution is changing

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:38.010
very quickly over here.

00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:42.091
I would like more
points in this region.

00:13:42.091 --> 00:13:43.590
In MATLAB, there's
a function called

00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:46.860
bvp4c, which is a boundary
value problem solver.

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:48.506
It solves 1D boundary
value problems.

00:13:48.506 --> 00:13:49.630
And it does precisely this.

00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:52.080
It uses finite differences
and collocation.

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:54.090
And the good thing
about it is it's

00:13:54.090 --> 00:13:56.040
trying to adaptively
change where

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:57.270
these points are positioned.

00:13:57.270 --> 00:14:00.930
So it solves it, it looks where
things are changing quickly,

00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:05.496
and tries to shift its points
around and resolve it in order

00:14:05.496 --> 00:14:07.120
to improve the quality
of the solution,

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:10.751
hit certain targets
for the error.

00:14:10.751 --> 00:14:12.750
So what are these-- what
would these local basis

00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:13.650
functions look like?

00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:15.660
So we talked about these hats.

00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:16.395
They're 1 here.

00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:21.820
They're going to be 0 on
either side of this point.

00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:27.940
We could call this our hat i,
which is centered at point xi.

00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:33.720
And it's going to be a
piecewise sort of function.

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:37.560
It's going to be an increasing
linear function between x i

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:39.120
minus 1 and xi.

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:44.510
So for x between xi and x i
minus 1, it'll have one form.

00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:45.670
Then it's going to switch.

00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:48.044
It's going to be a decreasing
function on the other side.

00:14:48.044 --> 00:14:55.060
So between xi and x i plus 1,
it'll have a different form.

00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:57.535
So here, it's going to
increase between 0 and 1.

00:14:57.535 --> 00:14:59.160
So it's going to have
to look something

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:07.650
like x minus x i minus 1
divided by xi minus x i minus 1.

00:15:07.650 --> 00:15:09.847
So it goes from 0 to 1.

00:15:09.847 --> 00:15:11.430
And then on the other
side, it's going

00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:13.920
to have to have
the opposite sign.

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:15.950
So this is going to
have to look like--

00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:24.250
let's see, x minus x i plus 1
divided by xi minus x i plus 1.

00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:25.500
Will that do it?

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:26.540
I think so.

00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:28.380
OK?

00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:30.130
You want me to make
it look like this one.

00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:33.430
So we could have plus 1 xi,
and then put a minus sign

00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:35.210
in front of it if you want.

00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:37.780
You decide how you
want to write it.

00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:40.210
But it describes this line
here and this line here.

00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:42.420
But there are other choices.

00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:46.060
So it doesn't have to be
piecewise linear necessarily.

00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:48.700
A lot of times, people
choose different types

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:52.240
of splines, different types
of interpolating functions.

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:54.130
They might not be
localized to one point.

00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:56.620
They might be localized
over a few points.

00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:59.260
Maybe something about the
physics of a particular problem

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:01.990
that tell you,
you can't get away

00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:04.270
with these piecewise
linear functions.

00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:06.130
They're not good
enough to describe,

00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:08.430
say, higher-order
derivatives in your equation.

00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:11.800
So you might instead
interpolate with, I don't know,

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:15.256
like a quadratic basis function
that spans a few more points.

00:16:15.256 --> 00:16:15.880
That'd be fine.

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:18.400
It would be easy to do the
integration in your Galerkin

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:19.240
method.

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:21.500
You just do these integrals out.

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:24.880
They're complicated, but you do
them once for a generic point

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:29.069
xi, and you know their value
for every point in the domain.

00:16:29.069 --> 00:16:29.860
So you choose them.

00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:30.901
You choose the basis set.

00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:36.910
But that'll give me an equation
for the tent function centered

00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:37.424
at xi.

00:16:37.424 --> 00:16:39.340
That's the tent function
centered at any point

00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:42.250
in the domain, in principle.

00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:45.680
In many dimensions, right--
so if I have two dimensions,

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:50.994
you see in COMSOL, you have
a sort of a triangular mesh.

00:16:50.994 --> 00:16:52.410
And what does my
tent function do?

00:16:52.410 --> 00:16:58.030
It sort of stands up, stands
up above the triangle.

00:16:58.030 --> 00:16:58.980
It's a real tent now.

00:16:58.980 --> 00:16:59.850
It's coming out of the board.

00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:00.600
Can you see it?

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:01.590
Put on your 3D glasses.

00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:02.240
You'll see it.

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:03.860
But it's coming
out of the board.

00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:06.545
It has height 1 above
this triangular domain.

00:17:06.545 --> 00:17:08.670
It sits at the center of
the triangle, for example.

00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:10.010
It's one way to
draw these elements.

00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:11.490
There are actually many
ways to draw these elements.

00:17:11.490 --> 00:17:13.676
This is just one way of
drawing these elements.

00:17:13.676 --> 00:17:16.560
OK?

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:17.060
Good.

00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:19.730
Other questions?

00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:21.646
AUDIENCE: Could you
please explain why central

00:17:21.646 --> 00:17:24.569
differencing is second-order
accurate and not--

00:17:24.569 --> 00:17:25.829
JAMES SWAN: Oh, good question.

00:17:28.697 --> 00:17:29.280
Good question.

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:33.331
So why is central differencing
second-order accurate?

00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:40.520
So the central
difference formula

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:44.270
says that the derivative
of a function x

00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:46.045
could be written as--

00:17:46.045 --> 00:17:53.450
let's see, f at x i plus
1 minus f at x i minus 1,

00:17:53.450 --> 00:17:57.650
divided by 2 delta x.

00:17:57.650 --> 00:17:59.662
Or let's say these aren't
equally spaced points.

00:17:59.662 --> 00:18:01.870
Well, let's make these
equally spaced points for now.

00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:04.160
Let's make it easy.

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:11.149
So let's say x i plus
delta x and x i minus--

00:18:11.149 --> 00:18:13.190
it'll make our lives easier
if we do it this way.

00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:16.190
It can be generalized, but let's
do it the easiest possible way.

00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:19.000
And this is the derivative
at the point xi.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:24.890
Graphically, here's
x, here's xi.

00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:26.680
Here's my function.

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:28.490
I want to know what
the slope here is.

00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:34.040
And I'm going to approximate it
by looking one point upstream

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:37.000
and one point downstream.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.730
And I'm going to connect
those points with a line.

00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:42.800
You would agree that
as the spacing gets

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:45.350
smaller and smaller, it will be
a good approximation for what

00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:46.100
the derivative is.

00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:48.370
So why is it
second-order accurate?

00:18:48.370 --> 00:18:51.050
So you can show that.

00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:53.080
It's not too hard.

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:55.190
You can show that using
Taylor series expansion.

00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:56.750
Like everything
else in this course,

00:18:56.750 --> 00:18:58.166
the Taylor series
is really a key.

00:18:58.166 --> 00:19:00.230
So let's look at it.

00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:05.745
So f at x i plus delta x.

00:19:05.745 --> 00:19:07.370
I want to write this
as a Taylor series

00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:10.220
expansion about the point xi.

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:13.121
So tell me the first term.

00:19:13.121 --> 00:19:13.620
f of xi.

00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:19.842
OK, tell me the second term.

00:19:19.842 --> 00:19:22.590
AUDIENCE: f prime at xi.

00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:24.450
JAMES SWAN: f prime at xi.

00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:25.490
Times?

00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:26.240
AUDIENCE: Delta x.

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:27.750
JAMES SWAN: Delta x.

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:30.175
Tell me the third term.

00:19:30.175 --> 00:19:32.400
AUDIENCE: 1/2 f double prime.

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:35.550
JAMES SWAN: 1/2 f
double prime at?

00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:36.630
AUDIENCE: Xi.

00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:37.380
JAMES SWAN: Times?

00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:39.800
AUDIENCE: Delta x squared.

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:41.537
JAMES SWAN: How big
is the third term?

00:19:41.537 --> 00:19:43.297
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:43.297 --> 00:19:43.922
JAMES SWAN: OK.

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:50.370
Is this always true, by the way?

00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:51.540
This?

00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:52.597
Not always, right?

00:19:52.597 --> 00:19:54.930
There are lots of functions,
non-analytic functions that

00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:56.530
don't have these
sorts of expansions.

00:19:56.530 --> 00:19:58.007
So we're sort of--

00:19:58.007 --> 00:20:00.340
we've got to have a function
that has these derivatives.

00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:02.010
They need to exist
at the point xi.

00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:04.640
Let's assume that's true, OK?

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:05.460
Good.

00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:07.770
OK, now I'm going to do
something really simple.

00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:15.644
Let's write f at
x i minus delta x.

00:20:15.644 --> 00:20:17.310
And let's just point
out the differences

00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:18.780
between these two formulas.

00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:22.140
So this is the same.

00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:27.467
This switches sign because
delta x switched signs.

00:20:27.467 --> 00:20:28.300
It was plus delta x.

00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:30.850
Now it's minus delta x.

00:20:30.850 --> 00:20:35.940
This is the same, delta x
squared, same as minus delta

00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:36.440
x squared.

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:38.020
Doesn't matter.

00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:40.510
This one down here-- well, OK.

00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:42.085
It's order delta x cubed.

00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:48.781
It'll actually look the same
but have the opposite sign.

00:20:48.781 --> 00:20:49.280
OK?

00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:56.690
We can't resolve it, though.

00:20:56.690 --> 00:20:59.330
That's sort of the
tricky part, right?

00:20:59.330 --> 00:21:01.250
We don't know.

00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:03.710
We don't know for sure
what value that takes on.

00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:06.530
This just gives us
a bound for how big

00:21:06.530 --> 00:21:08.390
the error is in this expansion.

00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:13.850
So let's now compute
what's in that formula.

00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:18.620
So if you take the difference
between this and this,

00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:21.890
these two will cancel.

00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:23.830
These two will combine.

00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:30.260
I'll get 2 f prime
xi times delta x.

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:33.240
These two will cancel.

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:34.610
So I'll get 0.

00:21:34.610 --> 00:21:40.889
These two, I can't rely
on them necessarily

00:21:40.889 --> 00:21:41.930
canceling each other out.

00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:44.112
In fact, they want to
combine in principle, right?

00:21:44.112 --> 00:21:45.320
We've just bounded the error.

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:46.903
Here, we don't really
know what it is,

00:21:46.903 --> 00:21:53.750
but it gives me something that's
order delta x cubed in size.

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:55.900
So this is the--

00:21:55.900 --> 00:22:04.390
this is 1 minus 2.

00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:08.380
It's 2 f prime xi times
delta x plus the error,

00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:10.760
which is order delta x cubed.

00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:12.375
If I divide by 2 delta x--

00:22:15.301 --> 00:22:17.550
I know you guys hate it when
the instructor does this,

00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:20.430
but you know, you can't help it.

00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:24.360
Divide by delta x, the error
becomes order delta x squared.

00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:27.780
So if the derivative is this
thing plus some order delta

00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:31.680
x squared piece, it's
second-order accurate,

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:32.820
we would say, right?

00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:39.220
The error is going to be reduced
like the square of the spacing.

00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:42.270
Now you can imagine all the
finite difference formulas out

00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:44.730
there in the world are
constructed in this way.

00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:46.110
You use Taylor series expansion.

00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:47.340
You've got as many
terms as you need

00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:48.923
to go for the level
of accuracy you're

00:22:48.923 --> 00:22:52.530
trying to achieve for different
points based in different ways.

00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:56.400
And you try to dream up
some linear combination

00:22:56.400 --> 00:23:00.180
of these things so that you get
a certain level of accuracy.

00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:01.440
They're also not unique.

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:04.890
I can construct these in
a lot of different ways

00:23:04.890 --> 00:23:09.780
and have the same sort
of error level out here,

00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:12.120
but different coefficients
associated with the error,

00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:13.787
but the same overall scaling.

00:23:13.787 --> 00:23:15.870
And then you might choose
different approximations

00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:16.670
for other reasons.

00:23:16.670 --> 00:23:16.970
Sam.

00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:18.594
AUDIENCE: What would
stop me from going

00:23:18.594 --> 00:23:20.421
on further and then
just subtracting

00:23:20.421 --> 00:23:21.900
f prime from both sides?

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:24.365
I mean, it wouldn't
really tell me anything,

00:23:24.365 --> 00:23:29.699
except maybe the order of
[INAUDIBLE] approximately 0.

00:23:29.699 --> 00:23:30.990
JAMES SWAN: Well, I mean, yeah.

00:23:30.990 --> 00:23:32.520
So let's say you go out further.

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:33.660
What's the next term here?

00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:41.130
It's going to be 1 over 6 f
triple prime xi delta x cubed.

00:23:41.130 --> 00:23:44.790
And here, you'll have minus that
because I cubed the delta x.

00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:46.890
So when I combine
them, I'll actually

00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:49.780
get 1 over 3 f triple prime.

00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:51.030
So I could do a little better.

00:23:51.030 --> 00:23:52.404
If I knew what my
function was, I

00:23:52.404 --> 00:23:55.260
can tell you exactly
how big the error was.

00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:56.950
I can tell you
that it was as big

00:23:56.950 --> 00:23:59.264
as the third derivative of f.

00:23:59.264 --> 00:24:01.680
My function doesn't have a
third derivative at that point.

00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:03.460
The error might be huge.

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:07.080
And it's possible to
construct functions that lack

00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:09.939
that particular property, OK?

00:24:09.939 --> 00:24:12.480
So you can go further, and you
can use it to sort of quantify

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:15.390
exactly how many you
think the error might

00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:17.200
be in the approximation.

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:19.740
But it's all constructed
from linear combinations

00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:24.510
of different Taylor expansions
about nearby points.

00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:27.810
And the related
problem, actually,

00:24:27.810 --> 00:24:32.250
the equivalent problem is
polynomial interpolation.

00:24:32.250 --> 00:24:33.620
So the sort of--

00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:36.030
if you can somehow, in your
mind, transpose this problem,

00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:38.460
it looks a lot like
polynomial interpolation.

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:41.752
So these two are intimately
related to each other.

00:24:41.752 --> 00:24:43.656
OK?

00:24:43.656 --> 00:24:44.608
Yes.

00:24:44.608 --> 00:24:46.149
AUDIENCE: How much
do we have to know

00:24:46.149 --> 00:24:47.441
about polynomial interpolation?

00:24:47.441 --> 00:24:49.107
JAMES SWAN: How much
do you have to know

00:24:49.107 --> 00:24:50.590
about polynomial interpolation?

00:24:50.590 --> 00:24:52.840
AUDIENCE: Yeah, like, do we
have to be able to compute

00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:54.546
the primes and polynomials?

00:24:54.546 --> 00:24:55.670
JAMES SWAN: Say that again.

00:24:55.670 --> 00:24:57.419
AUDIENCE: Do we have
to be able to compute

00:24:57.419 --> 00:24:59.610
the primes of polynomials?

00:24:59.610 --> 00:25:03.550
[INAUDIBLE]

00:25:03.550 --> 00:25:07.186
JAMES SWAN: What do I
want to say about that?

00:25:07.186 --> 00:25:12.190
I wouldn't expect
that level of detail.

00:25:12.190 --> 00:25:14.400
I think it's quite
difficult to construct

00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:17.370
Lagrange polynomial
expansions by hand.

00:25:17.370 --> 00:25:19.920
I don't know anyone
who does that

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:21.380
professionally or for pleasure.

00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:26.730
I think that's a bad idea.

00:25:26.730 --> 00:25:28.890
You should understand
polynomial interpolation.

00:25:28.890 --> 00:25:30.420
You should understand
the context

00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:32.880
in which it's important.

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:37.150
What is polynomial interpolation
important for, numerically?

00:25:37.150 --> 00:25:38.350
Do you recall?

00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:38.850
Hersch.

00:25:38.850 --> 00:25:39.870
AUDIENCE: Numerical integration.

00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:41.578
JAMES SWAN: Numerical
integration, right.

00:25:41.578 --> 00:25:44.220
So this was really the key
to numerical integration,

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:48.150
was trying to construct
appropriate approximations

00:25:48.150 --> 00:25:50.760
of our function from
a finite set of data

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:52.660
and figure out the
area under the curve.

00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:56.940
So you should understand how one
uses polynomial interpolation

00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:58.620
to do numerical integration.

00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:03.350
But I wouldn't expect us to
ask you to actually compute

00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:06.780
a polynomial interpolant
and numerically

00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:08.330
integrate it by hand.

00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:10.910
I think that's too much.

00:26:10.910 --> 00:26:11.410
OK?

00:26:11.410 --> 00:26:11.845
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:26:11.845 --> 00:26:12.470
JAMES SWAN: OK.

00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:13.387
More questions.

00:26:17.450 --> 00:26:17.969
Hersch.

00:26:17.969 --> 00:26:19.344
AUDIENCE: Now do
you mind showing

00:26:19.344 --> 00:26:26.042
how the trapezoid rule is
over delta t squared accurate?

00:26:26.042 --> 00:26:26.750
JAMES SWAN: Sure.

00:26:30.243 --> 00:26:32.240
AUDIENCE: For ODE IVPs.

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:33.680
JAMES SWAN: For ODE--

00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:34.850
AUDIENCE: IVPs.

00:26:34.850 --> 00:26:36.340
JAMES SWAN: ODE IVP, OK.

00:26:44.490 --> 00:26:47.520
OK, so we have to have
an ODE we want to solve.

00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:50.321
Can I just do-- can I do
a one-dimensional unknown?

00:26:50.321 --> 00:26:51.570
Do I need to do a vector here?

00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:53.850
Can I just-- would
you be satisfied

00:26:53.850 --> 00:26:58.175
if I wrote this as f of
y and t and that it's

00:26:58.175 --> 00:26:59.050
sufficiently general?

00:26:59.050 --> 00:27:00.550
That way, you don't
have to blame me

00:27:00.550 --> 00:27:02.690
when I forget to underscore
things along the way.

00:27:02.690 --> 00:27:03.870
And we don't have to
think about the Jacobian

00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:04.786
or anything like that.

00:27:04.786 --> 00:27:05.880
OK.

00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:08.864
So oh, time derivative, right?

00:27:08.864 --> 00:27:10.530
So there's the ODE
we're going to solve.

00:27:14.270 --> 00:27:15.480
The trapezoid rule.

00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:25.112
OK, so let's do this
the following way.

00:27:25.112 --> 00:27:27.570
It's actually going to wind up
looking very similar to what

00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:28.980
we just did, which is useful.

00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:30.975
I might even be able to pull
that board down and reuse it

00:27:30.975 --> 00:27:31.766
at a certain point.

00:27:31.766 --> 00:27:32.766
So that'll be good.

00:27:32.766 --> 00:27:33.740
Let's do this.

00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:39.129
So what is-- ultimately,
what is ODE IVP solving like?

00:27:39.129 --> 00:27:41.670
What are you trying to do when
you solve one of these things?

00:27:41.670 --> 00:27:42.770
AUDIENCE: Extrapolate.

00:27:42.770 --> 00:27:46.540
JAMES SWAN: It's
extrapolation, right?

00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:49.080
I know the value of y initially.

00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:53.670
I'm trying to figure out where
the hell this thing is going.

00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:55.100
I've got to extrapolate for it.

00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:57.720
And you should be very
uncomfortable with the notion

00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:00.240
that I can do that, right?

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:03.050
How good a job can I do
predicting the future

00:28:03.050 --> 00:28:05.700
knowing how things are now?

00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:08.890
It's really quite complicated.

00:28:08.890 --> 00:28:11.370
In fact, it's so
complicated, there

00:28:11.370 --> 00:28:14.760
are certain circumstances in
which it's not really possible.

00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:16.590
Discovered here
at MIT, actually.

00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:18.570
So there was weather
research going

00:28:18.570 --> 00:28:21.020
on at a certain point at MIT.

00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:22.200
It's a very famous case.

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:24.720
A researcher, a very
famous researcher

00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:28.050
was doing numerical simulations
of a weather model in an ODE

00:28:28.050 --> 00:28:29.430
IVP.

00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:32.300
He ran it for a
while, and he stopped.

00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:35.630
He looked at his end
state, the last value of y

00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:37.100
in his simulation.

00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:40.490
He put in three digits, used
that as the initial condition,

00:28:40.490 --> 00:28:43.340
and started his simulation
again, and it went wacky.

00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:45.688
Didn't look anything like
the initial solution.

00:28:45.688 --> 00:28:47.567
OK?

00:28:47.567 --> 00:28:48.400
How did that happen?

00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:50.980
It seemed fine up to that point.

00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:52.670
Solution's cranking along.

00:28:52.670 --> 00:28:54.577
He stopped.

00:28:54.577 --> 00:28:56.660
He took three digits
accuracy out of the computer,

00:28:56.660 --> 00:28:57.535
and he started again.

00:28:57.535 --> 00:29:00.450
And it, I don't know,
did something else.

00:29:00.450 --> 00:29:03.620
So there are problems that are
inherently chaotic and very

00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:05.780
sensitive to their
initial conditions.

00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:07.970
They're hard to resolve.

00:29:07.970 --> 00:29:11.090
So the entire point of
doing this sort of analysis

00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:15.470
of ODE IVPs is, at least
in the best-case scenarios,

00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:18.530
we want to try to manage
the error associated

00:29:18.530 --> 00:29:19.990
with these kinds
of extrapolation.

00:29:19.990 --> 00:29:23.529
In some case, it's
really not very possible.

00:29:23.529 --> 00:29:25.070
You don't know the
initial conditions

00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:27.920
well enough to predict
what the final state is.

00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:30.650
So there are problems
that are inherently

00:29:30.650 --> 00:29:33.180
unstable or sensitive to
their initial conditions.

00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:35.150
They don't have
to blow up either.

00:29:35.150 --> 00:29:38.240
They can find themselves
moving through the phase space

00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:40.460
in some way that's
very, very sensitive.

00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:42.110
And two points that
start very close

00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:45.710
together can wind up very
far apart from each other.

00:29:45.710 --> 00:29:48.140
So that's deterministic chaos.

00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:51.470
But outside of those problems,
we try to do this extrapolation

00:29:51.470 --> 00:29:55.820
and figure out sort of a
best approximation for where

00:29:55.820 --> 00:30:00.830
we think our target
function is going.

00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:02.270
So what are we trying to do?

00:30:02.270 --> 00:30:08.470
In principle, we know
y at a certain point.

00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:11.860
And we want to know
where it's going to go.

00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:17.670
And so you might say, well,
maybe I know dy dt initially.

00:30:17.670 --> 00:30:21.850
And so I should just
move a small increment

00:30:21.850 --> 00:30:22.900
along that slope.

00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:24.233
And that's a good approximation.

00:30:24.233 --> 00:30:26.740
That's the forward
Euler approximation.

00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:28.510
Trapezoid rule--
or equivalently,

00:30:28.510 --> 00:30:30.190
the midpoint rule--

00:30:30.190 --> 00:30:34.970
says, well, maybe
that initial slope

00:30:34.970 --> 00:30:37.250
isn't really the
right one to use.

00:30:37.250 --> 00:30:39.200
Maybe y does
something like this,

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:43.840
and we should actually
look sort of halfway

00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:45.970
between the point we're
trying to extrapolate

00:30:45.970 --> 00:30:50.860
to and the current point, and
use that value as the best

00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:53.350
approximation of the
derivative and extrapolate

00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:54.347
for it along that.

00:30:54.347 --> 00:30:55.930
And it turns out
that's more accurate.

00:30:55.930 --> 00:30:57.560
So what does that look like?

00:30:57.560 --> 00:31:02.610
So one typically
says, you know, y

00:31:02.610 --> 00:31:13.570
i plus 1 is equal to yi
plus delta t times f y

00:31:13.570 --> 00:31:16.420
i plus 1/2 comma.

00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:18.320
And we won't worry
about the t here,

00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:22.080
but it's going to have
to be t i plus 1/2.

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:25.000
So I look halfway
forward in time.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.970
And I say, that's the slope,
that's the derivative of y.

00:31:27.970 --> 00:31:30.950
So let me step forward
along that line.

00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:34.510
It turns out this is going to
be reasonably accurate if I

00:31:34.510 --> 00:31:37.780
can get a good approximation
for y i plus 1/2.

00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:39.621
OK?

00:31:39.621 --> 00:31:40.120
OK.

00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:42.420
So let's-- [COUGH].

00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:44.140
Excuse me.

00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:44.640
Yeah.

00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:46.390
AUDIENCE: Is this the
midpoint method or--

00:31:46.390 --> 00:31:48.930
JAMES SWAN: They're functionally
equivalent to each other.

00:31:48.930 --> 00:31:52.340
They work in precisely
the same fashion.

00:31:52.340 --> 00:31:54.840
So whether it's the trapezoidal
rule or the midpoint method,

00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:59.420
they have fundamentally
the same pictures there.

00:31:59.420 --> 00:31:59.920
OK?

00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:04.840
Here, if you do
forward Euler, you're

00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:07.930
doing numerical integration,
assuming the slope is

00:32:07.930 --> 00:32:09.100
the value at this point.

00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:11.710
If you're doing the midpoint
method or the trapezoid rule,

00:32:11.710 --> 00:32:13.930
you're trying to get a better
approximation for the slope,

00:32:13.930 --> 00:32:14.230
right?

00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:15.771
So you're trying to
build a trapezoid

00:32:15.771 --> 00:32:18.260
and integrate the area
under that trapezoid.

00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:22.260
So they're fundamentally
the same thing.

00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:27.810
Now the question becomes, I
don't know f at y i plus 2.

00:32:27.810 --> 00:32:31.020
So I need to use a Taylor
expansion of this quantity

00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:33.510
in terms of the value
of f that I know.

00:32:33.510 --> 00:32:38.070
So I need to expand this
in terms of f at yi.

00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:43.770
And I'll know the derivative
of y with respect to t at yi.

00:32:43.770 --> 00:32:45.430
I know it from this formula.

00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:48.270
So if I take this
Taylor expansion

00:32:48.270 --> 00:32:52.520
and I carry it out to the
first term I don't know,

00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:55.280
which is the order
delta t squared term,

00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:57.320
and I carry through
all of the errors,

00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:01.460
I'll find out that there's a
numerical error proportional

00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:03.050
to order delta t squared.

00:33:03.050 --> 00:33:10.560
So I need to do exactly
this and substitute

00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:14.634
in terms of quantities I know
and quantities I don't know.

00:33:14.634 --> 00:33:16.050
And the leading-order
contribution

00:33:16.050 --> 00:33:18.550
of the quantities I don't know
will give me this order delta

00:33:18.550 --> 00:33:20.089
t squared piece.

00:33:20.089 --> 00:33:21.755
And that'll give me
the local truncation

00:33:21.755 --> 00:33:23.672
error in the solution.

00:33:23.672 --> 00:33:26.090
Does that make sense?

00:33:26.090 --> 00:33:28.160
So it's still Taylor expansions.

00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:29.420
Good.

00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:32.000
Other questions.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:33.170
Yes.

00:33:33.170 --> 00:33:37.698
AUDIENCE: Why is the central
difference 0, not [INAUDIBLE]??

00:33:40.324 --> 00:33:42.115
JAMES SWAN: Why is the
central difference--

00:33:42.115 --> 00:33:44.253
AUDIENCE: No, why's the
outlook [INAUDIBLE] the one

00:33:44.253 --> 00:33:49.306
we did [INAUDIBLE]?

00:33:49.306 --> 00:33:52.240
That one is not implicit, right?

00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:58.020
JAMES SWAN: I don't think
I said anything like that.

00:33:58.020 --> 00:34:00.330
So implicit versus
explicit really

00:34:00.330 --> 00:34:04.350
depends on what
you're trying to do.

00:34:04.350 --> 00:34:06.990
So if I'm trying to use
a central difference

00:34:06.990 --> 00:34:13.050
formula of some sort to solve
an ODE which progresses forward

00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:14.460
in time--

00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:18.000
it has a direction associated
with it that things always

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.540
progress in-- then this
might be an explicit formula.

00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:27.600
Because I could solve for f at
x i plus 1 in terms of what's

00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:30.179
going on in the past.

00:34:30.179 --> 00:34:32.610
If we tried to do finite
differences in a boundary value

00:34:32.610 --> 00:34:35.760
problem instead, and that
boundary value problem

00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:39.210
doesn't have some direction
associated with it anymore--

00:34:39.210 --> 00:34:41.520
so it's not like space has
some preferred direction.

00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:43.949
Time goes in a
preferred direction.

00:34:43.949 --> 00:34:45.960
Space does not.

00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:50.310
You may find that the pointwise
equations you write down cannot

00:34:50.310 --> 00:34:54.164
be solved strictly in
terms of one of these.

00:34:54.164 --> 00:34:56.580
You can't just move this to
the other side of the equation

00:34:56.580 --> 00:34:58.163
and solve in terms
of everything else.

00:34:58.163 --> 00:35:00.450
So you'll have a
coupled set of equations

00:35:00.450 --> 00:35:06.472
that can't be diagonalized,
can't be simply reduced.

00:35:06.472 --> 00:35:08.430
They won't have the form
of, say, of triangular

00:35:08.430 --> 00:35:10.260
matrix, for example.

00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:12.180
This will happen.

00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:15.069
And in that case, you would
say this formula is implicit.

00:35:15.069 --> 00:35:17.610
So it really depends on which
problem you're trying to solve,

00:35:17.610 --> 00:35:20.250
whether you label them
explicit or implicit.

00:35:20.250 --> 00:35:24.810
Explicit is going to
mean that the data I want

00:35:24.810 --> 00:35:27.960
can be found with
a simple equation

00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:29.844
solve in terms of
the data I know.

00:35:29.844 --> 00:35:31.260
Implicit is going
to mean I've got

00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:35.540
to do some complicated
equation-solving methodology.

00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:37.530
I've got to go do
Gaussian elimination,

00:35:37.530 --> 00:35:40.650
or I need to go to fsolve
and solve this thing.

00:35:40.650 --> 00:35:42.930
The data that I want
is not available

00:35:42.930 --> 00:35:47.580
through some simple scheme where
I can just write explicitly

00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:51.190
a thing I want equals some
function of things I know.

00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:51.690
OK?

00:35:54.636 --> 00:35:56.109
Other questions.

00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:00.460
OK.

00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:00.960
Yeah.

00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:01.460
Yeah, yeah.

00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:04.136
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],, how
many questions will there be?

00:36:04.136 --> 00:36:07.082
And for each question,
how many subquestions?

00:36:07.082 --> 00:36:09.046
Could you just roughly--

00:36:09.046 --> 00:36:10.028
JAMES SWAN: Oh, man.

00:36:12.545 --> 00:36:14.090
The question was,
how many questions

00:36:14.090 --> 00:36:17.300
and how many
subquestions on the quiz?

00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:19.510
Yeah.

00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:23.330
The quiz is-- in
my opinion, it's

00:36:23.330 --> 00:36:27.800
now shorter than the
last one that you took.

00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:30.662
We've been pretty
sensitive to time concerns.

00:36:30.662 --> 00:36:32.120
We know that was
something that was

00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:34.820
an issue on the previous quiz.

00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:41.090
I think there's only going
to be two problems on it.

00:36:41.090 --> 00:36:43.910
They have many parts,
but we've really

00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:48.530
tried to refine the
questions in those parts.

00:36:48.530 --> 00:36:50.289
That's what you should expect.

00:36:50.289 --> 00:36:51.080
It's comprehensive.

00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:53.330
It Covers all the things
from this section.

00:36:53.330 --> 00:36:54.230
OK?

00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:55.046
Yes.

00:36:55.046 --> 00:36:57.892
AUDIENCE: Also, DAEs problem--

00:36:57.892 --> 00:36:58.600
JAMES SWAN: Yeah.

00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:01.760
AUDIENCE: It says that
as index increases,

00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:04.420
we have less degrees of freedom.

00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:06.344
JAMES SWAN: Yes.

00:37:06.344 --> 00:37:07.510
AUDIENCE: Could you explain?

00:37:07.510 --> 00:37:09.070
JAMES SWAN: Sure.

00:37:09.070 --> 00:37:10.780
Sure.

00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:16.340
So higher-index DAEs
come up all the time.

00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:20.850
And the degrees
of freedom refers

00:37:20.850 --> 00:37:23.820
to your ability to
choose initial conditions

00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:26.060
for the problem.

00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:28.665
And we saw several
examples in which,

00:37:28.665 --> 00:37:34.110
if we tried to convert
that DAE to an ODE,

00:37:34.110 --> 00:37:36.450
we found along the way that
there were certain hidden

00:37:36.450 --> 00:37:39.210
conditions that all the
initial conditions would need

00:37:39.210 --> 00:37:43.440
to satisfy in order for
this ODE, the system of ODEs

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:47.550
that we built from the DAEs, to
follow the same solution path

00:37:47.550 --> 00:37:51.120
or solution manifold as the
original DAE system would

00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:52.860
follow.

00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:54.630
The higher the
index is, the more

00:37:54.630 --> 00:37:56.325
of these hidden
constraints you find.

00:37:58.830 --> 00:38:00.480
And those hidden
constraints tell you

00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:02.970
that the initial conditions
have to be very particular.

00:38:02.970 --> 00:38:04.261
So there are--

00:38:04.261 --> 00:38:06.510
I would encourage you to
look at the specific examples

00:38:06.510 --> 00:38:07.590
in the notes.

00:38:07.590 --> 00:38:10.170
And you'll see there
was a simple CSTR

00:38:10.170 --> 00:38:14.160
example that was index 1
and almost unconstrained,

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:15.300
basically.

00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:18.200
There was an index
2 DAE in which

00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:21.112
the consistent initial
conditions, you actually

00:38:21.112 --> 00:38:23.070
couldn't specify any of
the initial conditions.

00:38:23.070 --> 00:38:27.600
They were fixed by the
equations themselves.

00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:30.810
But remember, that sort of
happened because certain DAEs

00:38:30.810 --> 00:38:33.270
are pathological in nature.

00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:35.970
They often ask us to do
something we can't do

00:38:35.970 --> 00:38:42.840
physically, like try to
control the input by-- or try

00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:44.880
to predict--

00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:46.780
let's see, how do I say this?

00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:49.270
It's easy for us to predict
the output knowing the input.

00:38:49.270 --> 00:38:53.140
It's very hard for us to predict
the input knowing the output.

00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:55.270
And these higher-index
DAEs were essentially

00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:58.180
asking us to do that.

00:38:58.180 --> 00:39:00.790
There's a lag in how
we measure things.

00:39:00.790 --> 00:39:03.610
And it's easier to go
forward through a process

00:39:03.610 --> 00:39:06.200
than backwards through a process
and make these predictions.

00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:09.345
There's inherent sensitivity
in doing the former.

00:39:09.345 --> 00:39:10.720
It's the same sort
of sensitivity

00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:13.780
you get from these
systems of ODEs, in fact.

00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:15.460
A small change in the
initial conditions

00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:18.460
can lead to big
changes in the outlet.

00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:21.790
So if I measure the outlet,
it's hard to predict the inlet.

00:39:21.790 --> 00:39:24.740
It's just very inherently
difficult to do.

00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:29.050
And so formulating a model
which has this high index,

00:39:29.050 --> 00:39:31.930
you will naturally
find that your choice

00:39:31.930 --> 00:39:34.180
of initial conditions for
the solution of that model

00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:35.570
are constrained.

00:39:35.570 --> 00:39:37.320
And they're constrained
because of the way

00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:38.920
you formulated the model.

00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:43.045
If you're actually trying to do
control of a chemical process,

00:39:43.045 --> 00:39:49.580
it's going to be very difficult
to try to somehow control the--

00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:53.350
try to make the input be a
certain thing by controlling

00:39:53.350 --> 00:39:55.357
the output.

00:39:55.357 --> 00:39:56.940
That doesn't make
sense almost, right?

00:39:56.940 --> 00:39:58.420
It seems very, very strange.

00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:01.330
You would really want to
change the input in order

00:40:01.330 --> 00:40:02.950
to hit a target in the output.

00:40:02.950 --> 00:40:05.410
How do you change the output
and hit a target in the input?

00:40:05.410 --> 00:40:08.710
The process doesn't actually
care about things in that way.

00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:09.610
And you saw that.

00:40:09.610 --> 00:40:11.762
Because in that
particular CSTR example,

00:40:11.762 --> 00:40:13.720
you couldn't fix any of
the initial conditions,

00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:14.560
actually, right?

00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:16.240
There was no free
choice in the problem.

00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:18.105
Everything was
automatically fixed,

00:40:18.105 --> 00:40:20.230
and you had to have perfect
knowledge of everything

00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:21.170
in the system.

00:40:21.170 --> 00:40:24.170
I wasn't actually able
to do control in a sense

00:40:24.170 --> 00:40:24.880
there, right?

00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:25.720
I could just measure
the output, and I

00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:27.678
can tell you what the
input was supposed to be.

00:40:27.678 --> 00:40:31.130
And it was super sensitive
to my measurement.

00:40:31.130 --> 00:40:32.680
So these high-index
problems tend

00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:35.800
to come up when we want
to constrain things

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:43.144
in a way that's, let's say,
physically quite challenging.

00:40:43.144 --> 00:40:44.560
High-index problems
are incredibly

00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:46.420
common in mechanical
engineering, things

00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:49.690
like robotics where
you want to make

00:40:49.690 --> 00:40:53.440
sure the robot's arm doesn't
whack someone in the head.

00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:54.675
This is important.

00:40:54.675 --> 00:40:56.050
And so you're
trying to constrain

00:40:56.050 --> 00:40:58.060
all these degrees of
freedom and the paths

00:40:58.060 --> 00:40:59.710
that it's going to move on.

00:40:59.710 --> 00:41:00.990
And all those constraints--

00:41:00.990 --> 00:41:03.400
I mean, there's actually a
very narrow envelope in which

00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:05.680
this thing gets to operate.

00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:09.460
So accurately
simulating the motion

00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:12.710
and then making the robot move
that way is very empowering.

00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:14.380
In chemical processes,
that's true, too.

00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:16.754
But oftentimes, we can make
choices in model formulation,

00:41:16.754 --> 00:41:17.380
right?

00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:20.050
Like how you try to
control the process that

00:41:20.050 --> 00:41:23.500
can ease those constraints.

00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:25.300
If I had some control
or it doesn't control

00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:27.190
in an instantaneous
fashion, even

00:41:27.190 --> 00:41:28.790
if it's a very
high-bandwidth control,

00:41:28.790 --> 00:41:31.540
there's still a finite time
for signals to propagate.

00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:33.790
There's dynamics associated
with the controller that

00:41:33.790 --> 00:41:37.300
can convert that DAE system into
a system of ODEs, for example.

00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:40.380
You don't have-- they
may be stiff ODEs.

00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:43.630
DAEs are the limit of sort of
infinite stiffness in ODEs.

00:41:43.630 --> 00:41:46.690
But they may not be as
troublesome to solve

00:41:46.690 --> 00:41:48.475
as the DAE system would be.

00:41:48.475 --> 00:41:49.870
OK?

00:41:49.870 --> 00:41:53.640
It's about model formulation.

00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:56.030
OK, can I talk
briefly about PDEs?

00:41:56.030 --> 00:41:57.301
Is that OK?

00:41:57.301 --> 00:41:58.800
I'll tell you a
little bit about it.

00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:00.210
I like this finite
volume method.

00:42:00.210 --> 00:42:02.784
I think it's very interesting.

00:42:02.784 --> 00:42:03.950
You've got some notes on it.

00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:05.430
I think I like it
because I think

00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:06.846
it comes very
naturally, actually,

00:42:06.846 --> 00:42:07.872
to chemical engineers.

00:42:07.872 --> 00:42:10.080
Because the problems we like
to solve are of the type

00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:13.290
that finite volume
eats for breakfast.

00:42:13.290 --> 00:42:17.310
These are problems
of conservation.

00:42:17.310 --> 00:42:19.350
So we have a
conserved quantity b.

00:42:19.350 --> 00:42:21.327
Is that what Dean
uses in his book?

00:42:21.327 --> 00:42:23.910
The new version still uses b as
the conserved quantity, right?

00:42:23.910 --> 00:42:26.400
So the time rate
of change of b is

00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:29.899
equal to minus the gradient
in the flux plus some,

00:42:29.899 --> 00:42:31.440
I don't know, some
volumetric change.

00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:34.110
Maybe a reaction, maybe
there's some injections

00:42:34.110 --> 00:42:39.150
somewhere of mass or momentum,
or you know, some source.

00:42:39.150 --> 00:42:41.820
And our numerical
solution, oftentimes, we

00:42:41.820 --> 00:42:44.700
would like it to also
conserve b, right?

00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:48.540
Conserve mass, conserve
momentum, conserve energy,

00:42:48.540 --> 00:42:51.320
conserve species.

00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:54.860
These collocation
methods in general,

00:42:54.860 --> 00:42:57.650
or relaxation methods in
general, don't do that.

00:42:57.650 --> 00:42:59.090
They're not designed to do that.

00:42:59.090 --> 00:43:02.450
You might be able to construct,
for example, basis functions

00:43:02.450 --> 00:43:06.530
that have that property that
they will satisfy conservation.

00:43:06.530 --> 00:43:11.600
You might be able to construct
certain meshing methods,

00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:12.930
certain collocation methods--

00:43:12.930 --> 00:43:15.410
and this is one of them,
the finite volume method--

00:43:15.410 --> 00:43:17.210
that respects conservation.

00:43:17.210 --> 00:43:19.730
And here's how you do it.

00:43:19.730 --> 00:43:22.430
So you worked really
hard in transport

00:43:22.430 --> 00:43:25.790
to derive these differential
forms of the transport

00:43:25.790 --> 00:43:26.450
equations.

00:43:26.450 --> 00:43:28.900
But finite volume actually
likes the integral form.

00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:31.250
So you've got to go back.

00:43:31.250 --> 00:43:33.650
So you've got to take the
integral of these equations

00:43:33.650 --> 00:43:38.500
over some volume V. And
then the time derivative

00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:41.000
of the amount of
b in this volume

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:46.310
is related to the flux
of b through the surfaces

00:43:46.310 --> 00:43:49.910
of that volume plus the
amount of generation

00:43:49.910 --> 00:43:53.760
or consumption of the conserved
quantity within that volume V,

00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:54.620
right?

00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:56.357
And this volume is
my finite volume.

00:43:56.357 --> 00:43:58.190
I take the domain of
interest, and I chop it

00:43:58.190 --> 00:44:00.590
up into all these
little volumes.

00:44:00.590 --> 00:44:04.620
And then I just need to
conserve b within that volume.

00:44:04.620 --> 00:44:06.680
So I have the first
equation you learned

00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:08.030
in chemical engineering, right?

00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:10.196
The amount of accumulation
of the conserved quantity

00:44:10.196 --> 00:44:13.160
is related to the fluxes in
and out of the control volume

00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:15.647
plus the amount of
generation or consumption

00:44:15.647 --> 00:44:16.730
within the control volume.

00:44:16.730 --> 00:44:18.730
This comes very naturally
to chemical engineers.

00:44:18.730 --> 00:44:21.290
It fits perfectly in the
problems we like to solve.

00:44:21.290 --> 00:44:21.936
Yeah.

00:44:21.936 --> 00:44:25.670
AUDIENCE: Is the nominal vector
pointing outwards or inwards?

00:44:25.670 --> 00:44:28.160
JAMES SWAN: Well, it all
depends on how we choose

00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:30.020
to write j, actually, right?

00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:33.740
So is j the flux into
or out of this volume?

00:44:33.740 --> 00:44:37.130
So I won't prescribe that here.

00:44:37.130 --> 00:44:39.140
It depends on what
you chose as the flux.

00:44:39.140 --> 00:44:43.620
So maybe, I don't
know, what does--

00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:47.420
Dean writes the stress tensor
with the opposite sign of Bird,

00:44:47.420 --> 00:44:48.480
Stewart, and Lightfoot.

00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:50.820
So these guys, that's the
flux of momentum, right?

00:44:50.820 --> 00:44:51.889
They choose a sign.

00:44:51.889 --> 00:44:53.680
Then the normals have
to respect that sign.

00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:54.596
Doesn't really matter.

00:44:54.596 --> 00:44:55.680
The physics doesn't care.

00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:58.070
You just have to choose the
flux in the right direction.

00:44:58.070 --> 00:45:01.860
If we think of j as the
flux into the volume,

00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:03.135
n should point in.

00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:10.410
OK, so you have this
conservation equation.

00:45:10.410 --> 00:45:12.657
You've got to solve for
each of your finite volumes.

00:45:12.657 --> 00:45:14.490
And the finite volumes
are coupled together,

00:45:14.490 --> 00:45:19.300
because a flux out of one volume
is a flux into another volume,

00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:19.800
right?

00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:23.760
So you can think of these
volumes as being little CSTRs.

00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:25.590
They're all sitting
next to each other.

00:45:25.590 --> 00:45:28.170
And they're all linked together
by these volumetric flows

00:45:28.170 --> 00:45:29.630
from one to another.

00:45:29.630 --> 00:45:31.470
And that's, in
fact, what they are.

00:45:31.470 --> 00:45:35.442
The key is, how do I model
these fluxes, basically?

00:45:35.442 --> 00:45:36.900
The accuracy of
the method is going

00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:40.081
to be set by how big a
volume am I going to model.

00:45:40.081 --> 00:45:41.580
Can't have infinitely
small volumes.

00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:43.163
There are going to
be too many of them

00:45:43.163 --> 00:45:45.930
in my domain to solve
the problem accurately.

00:45:45.930 --> 00:45:49.346
And then, do I have good
models for these fluxes?

00:45:49.346 --> 00:45:51.799
And you can think about
these terms in this way.

00:45:51.799 --> 00:45:52.840
That sometimes is useful.

00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:56.450
So this big B, the amount
of b in the volume,

00:45:56.450 --> 00:45:59.000
is like the volume
times the density

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:02.090
of b, the volumetric
density of b in the volume.

00:46:02.090 --> 00:46:04.520
The average density
in the volume.

00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:07.730
R is like the volume
multiplied by the average rate

00:46:07.730 --> 00:46:10.520
of generation or consumption.

00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:13.430
F is the flux in or out.

00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:16.340
It's the sum over all the
faces of the flux through each

00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:21.260
of the faces, which is the
area of the face multiplied

00:46:21.260 --> 00:46:23.150
by the average flux
through the face.

00:46:23.150 --> 00:46:24.590
So this is the
normal to the face,

00:46:24.590 --> 00:46:28.510
and this is the flux
through the face.

00:46:28.510 --> 00:46:29.300
And so I just--

00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:30.970
I'm going to solve
this equation.

00:46:30.970 --> 00:46:37.140
I try to figure out, in each
volume, what's the average b?

00:46:37.140 --> 00:46:38.670
That's what this tells me.

00:46:38.670 --> 00:46:40.350
On average, what is b?

00:46:40.350 --> 00:46:42.690
On average, what is
the concentration?

00:46:42.690 --> 00:46:44.790
On average, what is
the amount of momentum?

00:46:44.790 --> 00:46:48.020
On average, what is
the total energy?

00:46:48.020 --> 00:46:49.980
That's fine.

00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:51.420
So finite volume, very simple.

00:46:55.190 --> 00:46:56.780
What's nice about it?

00:46:56.780 --> 00:47:00.067
Well, you know, it's
really suitable to any sort

00:47:00.067 --> 00:47:01.400
of geometry you want to look at.

00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:05.210
We want to solve this equation,
say, in this square domain.

00:47:05.210 --> 00:47:07.880
We divide the domain up into a
bunch of little square volumes.

00:47:07.880 --> 00:47:12.380
And in each volume, we just make
sure that the amount of this b

00:47:12.380 --> 00:47:16.160
balances the fluxes
coming through the volume

00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:20.000
and the amount of
consumption or generation

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:22.370
of that quantity
within the volume.

00:47:22.370 --> 00:47:24.485
But it didn't have to be
a square domain, right?

00:47:24.485 --> 00:47:26.132
A square domain, that's OK.

00:47:26.132 --> 00:47:28.340
But maybe I want to solve
it on some circular domain.

00:47:28.340 --> 00:47:30.214
Well, I can divide that
up into volumes, too.

00:47:30.214 --> 00:47:32.780
And actually, these
equations are the same.

00:47:32.780 --> 00:47:34.370
They look identical.

00:47:34.370 --> 00:47:37.450
I've just got to calculate the
flux through each of the faces.

00:47:37.450 --> 00:47:39.280
OK?

00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:41.170
But maybe I'm interested
in, I don't know,

00:47:41.170 --> 00:47:43.080
pollution in one
of the Great Lakes.

00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:45.670
And I want to know how
concentration of some pollutant

00:47:45.670 --> 00:47:47.390
is transformed.

00:47:47.390 --> 00:47:49.730
I'd divide this up into a
bunch of little volumes, too.

00:47:49.730 --> 00:47:50.950
And now I've got to
calculate the flux

00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:52.116
through each of these faces.

00:47:52.116 --> 00:47:55.570
And that links all
these domains together.

00:47:55.570 --> 00:47:57.430
Maybe I'm interested
in transport

00:47:57.430 --> 00:48:00.347
within some porous
medium-- say, a bone.

00:48:00.347 --> 00:48:01.930
I think it's someone's
hip joint here.

00:48:01.930 --> 00:48:04.054
OK, well, I divide that up
into a bunch of volumes.

00:48:04.054 --> 00:48:07.220
And I still solve the exact
same conservation equation.

00:48:07.220 --> 00:48:10.510
So I've sort of decoupled
the problem of meshing

00:48:10.510 --> 00:48:13.504
and equations, the governing
equations associated

00:48:13.504 --> 00:48:14.170
with the meshes.

00:48:14.170 --> 00:48:16.830
As long as I have a way
to divide the domain up.

00:48:16.830 --> 00:48:18.390
It may be very complicated.

00:48:18.390 --> 00:48:20.789
I'm going to go ask a buddy
in applied math to do that.

00:48:20.789 --> 00:48:23.080
But I'm going to come to him
with the right engineering

00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:25.450
equations for each of those
domains, a little equation

00:48:25.450 --> 00:48:26.420
for a CSTR.

00:48:26.420 --> 00:48:28.360
OK?

00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:35.950
Turns out this-- you know,
one of the most common

00:48:35.950 --> 00:48:38.260
fluid mechanical codes out
there that people use now

00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:39.840
is OpenFOAM.

00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:42.010
So it's very common.

00:48:42.010 --> 00:48:42.990
Lots of people use it.

00:48:42.990 --> 00:48:44.230
It's a very general solver.

00:48:44.230 --> 00:48:45.610
Does finite volume.

00:48:45.610 --> 00:48:47.110
That's the method
it chooses to use.

00:48:47.110 --> 00:48:48.318
Why does it choose to use it?

00:48:48.318 --> 00:48:50.700
Because it wants to
conserved momentum?

00:48:50.700 --> 00:48:53.260
A guaranteed momentum
conservation.

00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:56.330
Can't lose momentum,
can't lose energy.

00:48:56.330 --> 00:48:57.770
Can't lose mass.

00:48:57.770 --> 00:48:59.560
I just have to pass
the right amount

00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:01.420
between each of these faces.

00:49:01.420 --> 00:49:03.340
As long as my calculation
of that is accurate,

00:49:03.340 --> 00:49:05.470
I've conserved the quantity.

00:49:05.470 --> 00:49:06.910
Never evaporates.

00:49:06.910 --> 00:49:11.260
Finite difference, finite
element, different basis

00:49:11.260 --> 00:49:14.640
set expansions-- they
will have this problem

00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:16.480
that at low levels
of accuracy, you

00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:20.320
can have sort of artificial
consumption of, say,

00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:22.870
the quantity, or
artificial production

00:49:22.870 --> 00:49:26.420
of the conserved
quantity of interest.

00:49:26.420 --> 00:49:29.020
So this can be a very nice
way to solve these problems.

00:49:29.020 --> 00:49:30.370
It's another relaxation method.

00:49:30.370 --> 00:49:31.510
It's a type of collocation.

00:49:31.510 --> 00:49:34.030
I divide the domain up.

00:49:34.030 --> 00:49:36.891
And then I try to satisfy
conservation equations on each

00:49:36.891 --> 00:49:37.890
of these little volumes.

00:49:37.890 --> 00:49:40.604
Hence finite volume.

00:49:40.604 --> 00:49:42.410
OK?

00:49:42.410 --> 00:49:42.970
OK.

00:49:42.970 --> 00:49:46.990
So how do you solve PDEs by
hand or write your own code?

00:49:46.990 --> 00:49:48.700
There's a nice
little tutorial here.

00:49:48.700 --> 00:49:51.283
We'll see how far we're able to
get through it before I've got

00:49:51.283 --> 00:49:52.480
to give you guys your cards.

00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:54.790
But I'll illustrate
some key points

00:49:54.790 --> 00:49:56.380
that I think are
really important.

00:49:56.380 --> 00:49:58.960
So step one, no
matter what method

00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:02.290
you choose, whether you choose
collocation, whether you choose

00:50:02.290 --> 00:50:05.050
Galerkin, whether
you're using basis sets

00:50:05.050 --> 00:50:08.034
or you're using finite
elements or finite volumes,

00:50:08.034 --> 00:50:10.450
you've got some domain you're
trying to solve your PDE in.

00:50:10.450 --> 00:50:13.020
And you've got to discretize it.

00:50:13.020 --> 00:50:16.269
You've got to figure out
how to decompose the domain.

00:50:16.269 --> 00:50:18.310
So for finite differences,
you might decompose it

00:50:18.310 --> 00:50:19.990
into a series of
nodes at which you

00:50:19.990 --> 00:50:22.750
want to know the value of
your function, whatever

00:50:22.750 --> 00:50:24.162
that function is.

00:50:24.162 --> 00:50:25.870
For finite volume,
you would decompose it

00:50:25.870 --> 00:50:27.550
into cells in which
you would like

00:50:27.550 --> 00:50:30.790
to know the average value
of your conserved quantity.

00:50:30.790 --> 00:50:36.490
For finite elements, you divide
the domain up into some points,

00:50:36.490 --> 00:50:40.680
across which local basis
functions span the region.

00:50:40.680 --> 00:50:43.330
We would like to know the
weighting of these local basis

00:50:43.330 --> 00:50:45.716
functions near each
of these points.

00:50:45.716 --> 00:50:47.340
But you've got to
divide the domain up.

00:50:47.340 --> 00:50:50.590
And the most important
thing is you always

00:50:50.590 --> 00:50:54.910
choose the spacing of the nodes,
or the dimensions of the cells,

00:50:54.910 --> 00:50:56.470
to match the physics.

00:50:56.470 --> 00:50:59.890
A very natural thing to
want to do is to pick--

00:50:59.890 --> 00:51:02.380
say I've got this square grid--
to pick the number of grid

00:51:02.380 --> 00:51:04.000
points to discretize with.

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:05.710
I say, I'm going
to use 100 points

00:51:05.710 --> 00:51:07.917
in this dimension and 100
points in that dimension.

00:51:07.917 --> 00:51:09.250
Actually, that tells me nothing.

00:51:09.250 --> 00:51:11.350
That's an irrelevant number.

00:51:11.350 --> 00:51:15.590
The physics has no idea how many
grid nodes you put in there.

00:51:15.590 --> 00:51:17.500
Doesn't care.

00:51:17.500 --> 00:51:20.860
There are length scales that are
intrinsic to the problem you're

00:51:20.860 --> 00:51:22.540
trying to study.

00:51:22.540 --> 00:51:26.080
And the discretization should
resolve those physically

00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:28.330
relevant length scales.

00:51:28.330 --> 00:51:31.030
So it might be the
case that I only

00:51:31.030 --> 00:51:36.070
need a resolution of one part
in 10 along this dimension

00:51:36.070 --> 00:51:38.110
and one part in 10
along this dimension

00:51:38.110 --> 00:51:40.540
because the physics
are such that that's

00:51:40.540 --> 00:51:43.780
good to get a description of
the solution to this problem.

00:51:43.780 --> 00:51:47.140
It might be that I need one part
in a million in this dimension

00:51:47.140 --> 00:51:49.120
and one part in 10
in that dimension

00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:51.770
because the physics
are that way.

00:51:51.770 --> 00:51:53.795
So you really want to
think about length scales,

00:51:53.795 --> 00:51:54.670
not numbers of nodes.

00:51:54.670 --> 00:51:55.795
It's a very common mistake.

00:51:55.795 --> 00:51:58.600
You say, well, 100 and 100,
that makes sense, or 10 and 10.

00:51:58.600 --> 00:52:00.280
Or you know, you
pick these randomly.

00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:02.113
But you want to think
about physics instead.

00:52:02.113 --> 00:52:03.250
Here's a good example.

00:52:03.250 --> 00:52:05.580
This is my fault. You'll
solve a problem like this.

00:52:05.580 --> 00:52:08.710
You already saw it in some
sense in the finite element

00:52:08.710 --> 00:52:10.010
or COMSOL tutorial.

00:52:10.010 --> 00:52:13.330
But there's a little drug
patch here near this red zone.

00:52:13.330 --> 00:52:15.610
It's leaking drug
into a sheer flow,

00:52:15.610 --> 00:52:18.610
and it's all being
advected down.

00:52:18.610 --> 00:52:21.500
Here's my solution
to the problem.

00:52:21.500 --> 00:52:23.080
I think it's a pretty good one.

00:52:23.080 --> 00:52:27.270
Here's a solution from when I
taught of course two years ago

00:52:27.270 --> 00:52:28.780
that the TAs produced.

00:52:28.780 --> 00:52:32.050
And I didn't talk with the TAs
about this issue with length

00:52:32.050 --> 00:52:32.940
scales.

00:52:32.940 --> 00:52:34.800
And it sort of got
the right structure.

00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:36.790
You can see, here's
the patch, and there's

00:52:36.790 --> 00:52:39.850
some advection and diffusion.

00:52:39.850 --> 00:52:42.010
But it's not a very stable
solution, it turns out.

00:52:42.010 --> 00:52:44.740
It's also not very accurate.

00:52:44.740 --> 00:52:46.570
It doesn't reflect
the essential physics.

00:52:46.570 --> 00:52:48.210
And the point is
actually the scales.

00:52:48.210 --> 00:52:52.180
So here, the patch was 1
centimeter in diameter.

00:52:52.180 --> 00:52:53.950
And so here, you
got many centimeters

00:52:53.950 --> 00:52:56.680
long this direction,
where you get advection.

00:52:56.680 --> 00:52:58.990
Here, you've got 2
centimeters in this direction.

00:52:58.990 --> 00:53:01.570
But actually, the solution
is really confined down

00:53:01.570 --> 00:53:02.770
to this small space.

00:53:02.770 --> 00:53:10.060
The physics all happens at
fractions of a centimeter.

00:53:10.060 --> 00:53:12.070
You took Transport,
so you know that this

00:53:12.070 --> 00:53:14.110
is a problem in which
there's a boundary layer.

00:53:14.110 --> 00:53:16.900
And all the change
in concentration

00:53:16.900 --> 00:53:19.450
is confined to that
little boundary layer.

00:53:19.450 --> 00:53:21.430
So really, when you do
your numerical solution,

00:53:21.430 --> 00:53:23.205
you'll do like was done up here.

00:53:23.205 --> 00:53:25.330
Now the lengths are made
dimensionless on the width

00:53:25.330 --> 00:53:26.470
of the patch, but
they're-- you know,

00:53:26.470 --> 00:53:27.910
you can think of these as
measured in centimeters.

00:53:27.910 --> 00:53:29.380
But look at the dimension here.

00:53:29.380 --> 00:53:31.210
We need to resolve
the solution down

00:53:31.210 --> 00:53:34.900
at the 0.1 centimeter
and smaller scale.

00:53:34.900 --> 00:53:37.270
I want to put all my little
discretization or my nodes

00:53:37.270 --> 00:53:42.490
down here so that I can see how
the concentration field changes

00:53:42.490 --> 00:53:43.900
as a function of distance.

00:53:43.900 --> 00:53:45.649
I have to know something
about the physics

00:53:45.649 --> 00:53:46.690
to do that, though, OK?

00:53:46.690 --> 00:53:48.670
Can't just solve this blindly.

00:53:48.670 --> 00:53:51.520
It may or may not be
the case that COMSOL

00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:53.990
recognizes the
physical situation

00:53:53.990 --> 00:53:56.620
and remeshes your problem
to put mesh points down

00:53:56.620 --> 00:53:58.350
where they matter.

00:53:58.350 --> 00:53:59.150
It may do that.

00:53:59.150 --> 00:54:00.150
It may not do that.

00:54:00.150 --> 00:54:02.230
It just doesn't know.

00:54:02.230 --> 00:54:04.884
People build heuristics to
try to solve these remeshing

00:54:04.884 --> 00:54:06.550
problems, but they
may not always apply.

00:54:06.550 --> 00:54:08.800
So it's good to understand
the physics of the problem.

00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:11.300
This drug patch problem, this
is a pretty common transport

00:54:11.300 --> 00:54:11.800
problem.

00:54:11.800 --> 00:54:14.140
I mean, did Professor
Bazant give you guys

00:54:14.140 --> 00:54:15.570
a talk during your
visit weekend?

00:54:15.570 --> 00:54:17.100
Was that this last year?

00:54:17.100 --> 00:54:18.875
Was that two years ago?

00:54:18.875 --> 00:54:19.750
It was two years ago.

00:54:19.750 --> 00:54:22.790
He does problems with
bromine flow batteries.

00:54:22.790 --> 00:54:24.190
And they worked
exactly this way.

00:54:24.190 --> 00:54:26.850
You have flow of bromine in.

00:54:26.850 --> 00:54:29.522
An electrochemical reaction
takes place at the surface.

00:54:29.522 --> 00:54:31.230
This entire thing is
premised on the fact

00:54:31.230 --> 00:54:32.646
that you have a
very thin boundary

00:54:32.646 --> 00:54:36.240
layer in which the
electrochemical-- in which

00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:37.740
the reagents are confined.

00:54:37.740 --> 00:54:39.450
And if that boundary
layer gets too thick

00:54:39.450 --> 00:54:42.420
and reaches the other electrode,
it screws up the reaction

00:54:42.420 --> 00:54:44.310
and doesn't work as
a battery anymore.

00:54:44.310 --> 00:54:47.582
So being able to resolve
concentration gradients

00:54:47.582 --> 00:54:50.040
in this small domain, it's not
just important for this drug

00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:50.325
problem.

00:54:50.325 --> 00:54:51.585
It's important in general.

00:54:51.585 --> 00:54:55.140
It's a common sort of
transport-y type problem.

00:54:55.140 --> 00:54:56.640
And the numerical
solution is really

00:54:56.640 --> 00:54:59.190
going to hinge on your ability
to recognize the physics

00:54:59.190 --> 00:55:02.460
and resolve the solution
over the length scales that

00:55:02.460 --> 00:55:03.940
are important in the problem.

00:55:03.940 --> 00:55:05.220
OK?

00:55:05.220 --> 00:55:07.290
So that's the number
one most important thing

00:55:07.290 --> 00:55:08.460
for doing these PDEs.

00:55:08.460 --> 00:55:11.400
The rest of the
notes will take you

00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:13.980
through the construction
of a numerical solution

00:55:13.980 --> 00:55:18.660
to the diffusion equation in
2D, and some different scenarios

00:55:18.660 --> 00:55:22.090
that you might try to employ
in MATLAB to solve them,

00:55:22.090 --> 00:55:25.230
and how you can accelerate the
solution using different MATLAB

00:55:25.230 --> 00:55:26.340
functions.

00:55:26.340 --> 00:55:27.930
It's fun to try
out and play with.

00:55:27.930 --> 00:55:30.221
You'll see that I can make
the solution to this problem

00:55:30.221 --> 00:55:32.280
go very fast for a domain
that's quite highly

00:55:32.280 --> 00:55:36.790
discretized by recognizing
certain forms of the equations,

00:55:36.790 --> 00:55:39.330
choosing certain
solvers to solve with.

00:55:39.330 --> 00:55:40.470
OK?

00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:41.467
Good.

00:55:41.467 --> 00:55:43.050
All right, I'll meet
you guys in back,

00:55:43.050 --> 00:55:45.600
and we'll hand out
these gift cards.

00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:47.780
And good luck on your quiz.
