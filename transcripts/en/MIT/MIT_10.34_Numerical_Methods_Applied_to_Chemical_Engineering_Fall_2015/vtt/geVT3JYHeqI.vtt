WILLIAM GREEN: So
let's get started.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.470
This is my last
lecture of the class,

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:31.850
and I want to thank you guys.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:33.290
This has been a
really good class.

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.930
I really enjoyed the good
questions on the forum

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.790
especially.

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.100
So I don't know if
you guys enjoyed it,

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.120
but I liked it anyway.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.484
So I wanted to give--

00:00:45.484 --> 00:00:47.150
my lecture here is
going to be a wrap up

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.610
on the stochastic methods,
and then professor Swan's

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:51.260
going to give a
review on Wednesday.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.140
It will be the last
lecture of this class.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.121
And then the final is a
week from today, I think.

00:00:58.121 --> 00:00:59.950
Morning?

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:01.200
Yeah, morning.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.700
All right.

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:06.040
All right.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.820
So as you did in the
homework and we talked about,

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.980
there is a lot of
multidimensional integrals

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.020
we'd like to be
able to evaluate.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.930
And a lot of them
have this form that

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.270
is a probability
density time some f

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.580
that we're trying to evaluate.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:25.824
That's the integrand.

00:01:25.824 --> 00:01:28.240
And then I didn't draw in the
millions of integral symbols

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.050
around it.

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.670
But usually x is a very
high dimensional thing,

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.780
so you have to integrate
a lot of things.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.930
And often we actually
don't really know p.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.470
We know a waiting factor, w.

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.330
So I just drew three
of the integrals there,

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.750
but there might be 10 to
the 23rd integrals there.

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.090
So w is a lot easier for us
to deal with than anything

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.740
with all those integral signs.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.490
So for example, the
Boltzmann distribution

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.670
is one of these things.

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.860
And also, just
recall back earlier,

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.980
we were talking about
models versus data.

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.750
The Bayesian analysis
of experiments

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:07.519
says that you take your
likelihood function,

00:02:07.519 --> 00:02:09.310
the likelihood that
you would have observed

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.680
the data you did if
the parameters were

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.590
true for certain value, theta.

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.900
And then you multiply that
times the prior knowledge

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.110
of the parameter values, and
that gives you the weighting

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.680
factor really for any
integrals involving parameters,

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.980
because it's really giving you
the w of data given everything

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:30.760
you know.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.240
Prior information, and you also
know the new data you measured.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.309
And put them all together,
you get the weighting factor

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:39.100
for the parameters.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.740
And so you can
evaluate all kinds

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.745
of multidimensional integrals
over all the parameters

00:02:44.745 --> 00:02:45.370
in the problem.

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.530
So very often you
might do experiments

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.930
where you maybe have
four or five or six

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.630
adjustable parameters,
theta, some of which

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.910
you know something
about ahead of time,

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.430
and you want to put
them together this way.

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.710
And that should be a summary
of everything you know.

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:01.210
But it's sort of a
goofball summary,

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:03.670
because it's a multidimensional
function, right,

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.679
a function with a
lot of variables.

00:03:05.679 --> 00:03:07.720
But now you know how to
do integrals of functions

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:08.678
with lots of variables.

00:03:08.678 --> 00:03:14.577
So you can compute things
like some linear combination

00:03:14.577 --> 00:03:16.660
of-- what's the expectation
value of some function

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.050
of those parameters.

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.300
So if f, f here was
a function of theta--

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:22.353
why is it bouncing?

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:26.420
OK.

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.790
I wonder why you guys are
always look like this.

00:03:31.831 --> 00:03:32.330
All right.

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:37.094
So f of theta, of any function
you want, you can evaluate--

00:03:37.094 --> 00:03:38.510
it's a function
of the parameters,

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.000
like prediction of what will
happen in some new experiment

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.372
that depends on the parameters.

00:03:43.372 --> 00:03:45.080
You'd have it as f of
theta, and then you

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.850
could integrate
it over w of theta

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:52.400
to get the expected value of the
result of the new experiment.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.090
And also actually
the distribution

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.740
you have to get that way.

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:59.475
Does this make any sense?

00:03:59.475 --> 00:04:01.100
I see one person
thinks it makes sense.

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:05.350
OK.

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.230
So just because we did
Monte Carlo using Boltzmann,

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.081
which is a common
one to use, there's

00:04:10.081 --> 00:04:11.080
other weighting factors.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.190
I guess that's my comment.

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:13.731
And anytime you end
up something that

00:04:13.731 --> 00:04:16.660
has some integrals
with weighting factors,

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:21.399
then you should think, oh, I
can use Metropolis Monte Carlo.

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:24.820
And also, anytime you have
experiments, a lot of times

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.460
you think of the, OK, I want to
get the best fit least squares

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.126
approach, which is
what you already knew

00:04:29.126 --> 00:04:31.480
before I taught you anything.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.970
But it's very important to
remember that you can also

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.550
write the actual
probability density,

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.717
the shape of the probability
density the parameters.

00:04:38.717 --> 00:04:40.591
And that way you can
get all the correlations

00:04:40.591 --> 00:04:42.190
between the
parameters and include

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.190
all the previous knowledge
of the parameters

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.260
and stuff like that.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.500
So it's a very important thing
to remember from this course

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.590
is this Bayesian formula.

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:51.110
All right.

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:57.180
But Metropolis Monte Carlo,
as you saw in the homework,

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.750
is not always that easy.

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.730
So you need to choose the step
length in every dimension.

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:07.230
It's sort of the
factor you're going

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:10.740
to multiply times random numbers
to figure out how far to step

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.610
from one state to the next.

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:18.234
And it's not so obvious how to
choose that before you start

00:05:18.234 --> 00:05:19.650
because you may
not know that much

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:23.791
about the shape of
the integrand, right?

00:05:23.791 --> 00:05:26.290
Actually, even with the strength
of the p in the probability

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:28.880
distribution, you might
not be that sure about it.

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:33.710
And so if you accidentally
choose it too large,

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.190
what will happen is it
tries to take big steps away

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:39.640
from a probable state and ends
up at really improbable states,

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.290
and then most of the times it
won't accept that transition,

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.790
right?

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:44.770
Metropolis Monte Carlo will
just repeat the same state

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:45.603
over and over again.

00:05:45.603 --> 00:05:48.490
So if you see you just
keep sitting there getting

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:50.551
the same value over and
over and over again,

00:05:50.551 --> 00:05:52.300
then that's warning
you that you must have

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.020
chose your stepsize too large.

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.330
Alternatively, if you
choose it too small,

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.820
all your steps will be
accepted because you're not

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:00.795
moving anywhere.

00:06:00.795 --> 00:06:02.670
So you're basically
staying at the same point

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:05.336
over and over again, except it's
slightly different, because you

00:06:05.336 --> 00:06:07.230
took a little tiny step.

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:08.970
But that way you
won't necessarily

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:10.566
sample the whole range.

00:06:10.566 --> 00:06:11.940
And you can see
that by plotting.

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:19.840
They say the distance from
the initial state position.

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:24.270
You initiated the Monte Carlo
Markov chain at some state.

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:28.530
And if you plot probability
distribution of density,

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:31.810
the distance from all the new
states to the original state,

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:33.884
and if that number
is super teeny tiny,

00:06:33.884 --> 00:06:36.050
then you might be a little
concerned that you really

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:37.902
didn't cover the whole space.

00:06:37.902 --> 00:06:40.110
But again, you have to know
what is super teeny tiny,

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:41.330
so you have to have
a range in mind.

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:41.829
Yeah?

00:06:41.829 --> 00:06:43.640
AUDIENCE: Can you
do this adaptively?

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:44.973
WILLIAM GREEN: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:06:44.973 --> 00:06:47.180
So good algorithms for
this try to pick it up

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:48.596
that there's a
problem, like if it

00:06:48.596 --> 00:06:50.485
keeps on either not
accepting any states,

00:06:50.485 --> 00:06:53.340
it would try to shrink
the step, the delta.

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:55.320
Or if it's always
excepting the states,

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.910
then it might try
to increase it.

00:06:57.910 --> 00:06:59.910
You want accept actually
most of the transitions

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:01.410
because it makes
it more efficient.

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:02.410
But you don't accept them all.

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:03.150
So you want to do some--

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:05.540
I don't know-- keep it to
0.9 probability or something

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:07.599
like that, or 0.8.

00:07:07.599 --> 00:07:09.390
And there is probably
a whole journal paper

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:13.110
about what's the optimal way
to do the adaptive stepsizing

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:14.580
to get to convert the rest.

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:15.270
Yeah?

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:18.270
AUDIENCE: How did you prevent
your initial guess [INAUDIBLE]??

00:07:22.102 --> 00:07:23.560
WILLIAM GREEN:
Well, to me, I don't

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:25.070
think that throwing
them out is a good idea.

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:25.690
I don't know.

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:27.045
People do it.

00:07:27.045 --> 00:07:28.670
I think it's that
your really just need

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:33.370
to make enough steps that
you are sampling everywhere,

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:34.660
and then it shouldn't matter.

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:36.100
And a good thing
to do is actually

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:38.692
start from a completely
different initial state

00:07:38.692 --> 00:07:40.900
and make sure you get the
same value of the integral,

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:43.457
and that will give you
a lot more confidence

00:07:43.457 --> 00:07:44.790
that you're not sensitive to it.

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:46.870
If you're sensitive to
it, you're in trouble.

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:50.181
Because you really won't
know how many to throw away.

00:07:50.181 --> 00:07:52.180
And you don't know if you
actually even achieved

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:54.170
the real integral.

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:56.140
I think in the hydrogen
peroxide example,

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:58.000
actually it was symmetrical,
so it was a little bit

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:58.958
didn't matter too much.

00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:01.147
But it I had given you
an asymmetrical one,

00:08:01.147 --> 00:08:01.730
there's like--

00:08:05.675 --> 00:08:07.360
here's like the dihedral angle.

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:10.310
It has to do with the
orientation of the h,

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:12.240
like sort of out of the plane.

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:13.840
And it should be
symmetrical that you

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:17.200
can sort of plus and
minus, and there's

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:18.774
a high probability
region over here

00:08:18.774 --> 00:08:20.440
and a high probability
region over here.

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:21.700
And you start one of
them, say, over here,

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:22.880
and you just sample
around here, you

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:24.463
get a lot of points
all have basically

00:08:24.463 --> 00:08:26.460
the same value dihedral angle.

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:29.110
And you never see any of these,
then it's no good, right?

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:30.190
Now this particular
case, you might still

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:32.414
get the right answer by
luck, because they're exactly

00:08:32.414 --> 00:08:32.914
symmetrical.

00:08:32.914 --> 00:08:34.630
If this one is a little
bit asymmetrical,

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:36.159
then you'd get the wrong answer.

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:37.809
Does that make sense?

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:40.390
So you really want to
make sure you're really

00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:44.660
sampling over all the
physically accessible region.

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:47.720
But again, this is
a common problem

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:50.260
for us all the time,
is that when you're

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.010
doing a calculation,
you want to know what

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:54.390
the answer is before you start.

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:56.790
This is a absolutely
critical thing.

00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:59.440
Because how the heck you going
to know if you have a bug?

00:08:59.440 --> 00:08:59.940
Right?

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:02.990
The computer's going to give
you some number at the end.

00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:06.459
You have to know actually what
the answer is before you start.

00:09:06.459 --> 00:09:07.750
I know this seems weird, right?

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:08.927
But anyway, it's the truth.

00:09:08.927 --> 00:09:10.510
If you're going to
calculate anything,

00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:12.940
you really want to know
what the answer is roughly.

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:16.840
What the units are, what
the order of magnitude is.

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:18.192
Some things about it.

00:09:18.192 --> 00:09:20.650
And ideally you should try to
think of some simple test you

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:23.890
can do to try to check
whether your code's right,

00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:25.570
whether things are reasonable.

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:28.300
The reasonableness
test, is it reasonable

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:29.690
that what which you get.

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:31.390
So this is the
same kind of thing.

00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:33.980
Like you draw the H2O2
and say, oh, I think

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:35.980
the dipole moment should
be about such and such,

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:38.520
because I know the typical
charges on an H atom and O

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:39.021
atom.

00:09:39.021 --> 00:09:41.186
And if you get some number
that's way off from that,

00:09:41.186 --> 00:09:43.480
then obviously you made a
mistake somewhere, right?

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:44.938
It could be a
mistake in your code,

00:09:44.938 --> 00:09:47.640
or it could just be you
just didn't sample correctly

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:50.970
because your delta was
wrong, for example.

00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:52.919
All right?

00:09:52.919 --> 00:09:54.960
Now I know I've told this
to students every time,

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:56.010
and every time I tell
this to students,

00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:59.040
they totally reject this idea
that you should know the answer

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.090
before you start.

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:02.490
But it's absolutely critical.

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:04.665
I mean, my whole
job as a professor

00:10:04.665 --> 00:10:06.540
is I tell my students,
please calculate this.

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:09.540
But before I tell them that, I
know what the answer is, right,

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:10.400
roughly.

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.650
And so that way when they
come back and show it to me,

00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:14.210
I can say, oh, it's
reasonable, OK, I believe them.

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:14.724
Yeah.

00:10:14.724 --> 00:10:16.140
So I think the
number should be 20

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:18.360
and they come back with
14.3, I say, 20, 14.3,

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:19.800
they're pretty close.

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:21.250
OK, so I believe them.

00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:22.625
And when I think
it's 20 and they

00:10:22.625 --> 00:10:25.850
come back, it's 10 to the minus
6, then I'm pretty confident,

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:27.020
I tell them, I think you
must have made a mistake.

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:28.550
And they're like, no, no,
no, I did a great job.

00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:30.320
I'm sure my calculus is perfect.

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:31.610
And then I'm like, now
we're really probing,

00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:32.526
and I think I'm like--

00:10:32.526 --> 00:10:33.130
I don't know--

00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:33.830
I have it in for them.

00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:35.621
But no, actually I knew
what the answer is,

00:10:35.621 --> 00:10:37.460
so obviously it can't be right.

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:39.200
So they must have
made a mistake.

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:41.210
Anyway, you should
be like it, too.

00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:43.550
You want to be able to be
self-critical about what

00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:46.530
do you expect your answers
to be before you do them.

00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:47.030
All right.

00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:54.410
What else is problematic
with Monte Carlo?

00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:56.549
This is very problematic.

00:10:56.549 --> 00:10:58.090
If you want to
achieve high accuracy,

00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:00.280
you need a really
large number of states.

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:01.180
And it's funny.

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:04.120
It's like you can get a pretty
good accuracy with not very

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:06.620
many samples because
of the behavior of one

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:09.120
over square root of n.

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:12.587
So it has very big changes,
that small values of n.

00:11:12.587 --> 00:11:14.670
And just a relatively small
number of samples, you

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:16.950
get something that's
halfway reasonable.

00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:19.830
But then if you have
three significant figures

00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:21.482
and you want to
get the fourth one,

00:11:21.482 --> 00:11:23.940
it's a killer because you have
to do 100 times more effort,

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:27.950
100 times more samples to get
one more significant figure.

00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:29.870
And so you've
already done 100,000,

00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:31.470
and now all the sudden you
have to do 10 million samples.

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:33.490
And then you only get one
more [INAUDIBLE] of that.

00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:35.031
Now you have to do
a billion samples,

00:11:35.031 --> 00:11:37.900
and it's like, this
gets really out of hand.

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:40.032
So that's a really
unfortunate thing about it.

00:11:40.032 --> 00:11:42.490
But the nice behavior at the
beginning is you get roughly--

00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:44.160
if you only want a few
significant figures,

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.350
you can get them pretty
darn fast with Monte Carlo,

00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:47.766
certainly a lot
better than trying

00:11:47.766 --> 00:11:51.450
to do the trapezoid rule in
multidimensions or something

00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:53.990
like that.

00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:56.490
All right.

00:11:56.490 --> 00:11:58.230
So you guys just
did Monte Carlo.

00:11:58.230 --> 00:11:59.480
Are there things I
should tell you about

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:01.438
or we should talk about,
problems you ran into?

00:12:06.145 --> 00:12:08.520
Now you see, when I set that
homework problem up for you,

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:09.478
I helped you out a lot.

00:12:09.478 --> 00:12:10.870
I don't know if
you noticed that.

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:14.490
So the original problem
had, it's four atoms,

00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:17.350
they each have
three xyz positions.

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:19.500
So there's 12 coordinates.

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:22.080
And then I did clever
tricks to get it down to,

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:23.670
I think, six, maybe.

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:24.270
OK.

00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:26.560
So going from six
dimensions to 12 dimensions,

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:28.300
that's actually a
pretty big deal.

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:29.940
And so if I have given you
the original 12-dimensional

00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:31.500
problem, you could still
compute it and actually

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:33.320
use the same kind of
code as you wrote.

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:35.790
But the number samples you'd
need to get a good number

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:40.550
gets really wildly different.

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:43.130
Right, and so again, this
has to do with knowing

00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:44.870
the answer ahead of time.

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:47.420
You know, I knew, OK, that the
magnitude of the dipole moment

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:48.880
doesn't depend on the
orientation of the molecule,

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:49.730
so therefore, I'm
going to get rid

00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:51.200
of all the rotational
degrees of freedom.

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:53.408
I know it doesn't depend on
the transitional position

00:12:53.408 --> 00:12:56.660
of the molecule, so therefore,
I get rid of all those.

00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:58.479
And so before I even
did any calculation,

00:12:58.479 --> 00:13:00.770
I can tell you I can get rid
of six degrees of freedom,

00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:01.885
so that'll help you a lot.

00:13:01.885 --> 00:13:03.260
But it's a similar
kind of thing.

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:05.270
You want to do that all the
time yourself, is try to think

00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:07.340
what can I do that's easier
than just doing the brute force

00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:07.970
problem?

00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:08.615
Yeah?

00:13:08.615 --> 00:13:11.585
AUDIENCE: So on that problem,
changing the max stepsize,

00:13:11.585 --> 00:13:14.427
you could change the percentage
of step-- or [INAUDIBLE]..

00:13:14.427 --> 00:13:15.260
WILLIAM GREEN: Yeah.

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:18.634
AUDIENCE: And I think the mean
state roughly around the same,

00:13:18.634 --> 00:13:22.020
but the shape of distribution
actually changed a little bit.

00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:22.770
WILLIAM GREEN: OK.

00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:24.410
AUDIENCE: So how is--

00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:25.820
WILLIAM GREEN: So I think it
might be this kind of thing

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:26.570
is one part of it.

00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:30.846
It's like if you only integrate
one lobe of the dihedral,

00:13:30.846 --> 00:13:32.720
you actually get a dipole
moment value that's

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:35.460
pretty reasonable, even if you
totally missed this other lobe.

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:36.959
But if you did a
different stepsize,

00:13:36.959 --> 00:13:39.320
you might start getting
some samples over here, too.

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:41.360
So the distribution would
look a lot different,

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:43.276
but you still end up
getting roughly the mean.

00:13:43.276 --> 00:13:44.969
But also it's partly that the--

00:13:44.969 --> 00:13:46.760
the good thing about
the Monte Carlo method

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:48.800
is that, the first few samples,
no matter what they are,

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:50.660
give you something that's on
the order of magnitude of what

00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:52.310
the value of the thing is.

00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:54.770
So even a really lousy
sampling at the beginning

00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:55.880
still gives you
something that's halfway

00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:56.870
reasonable for the average.

00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:58.578
AUDIENCE: So if you're
trying to recreate

00:13:58.578 --> 00:14:02.250
the overall
distribution histogram,

00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:06.010
then how do you know which max
stepsize to choose, because

00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:07.774
[INAUDIBLE].

00:14:07.774 --> 00:14:09.940
WILLIAM GREEN: Yeah, so the
rule of thumb I've heard

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:11.860
is that people try
to get an acceptance

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:14.730
ratio between 0.2 and 0.8.

00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:18.600
So it means you want--

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:20.100
Yeah.

00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:21.210
But I really don't know.

00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:22.170
I'm not an expert in this field.

00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:23.700
But I'm sure you read
papers and people have

00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:25.950
big discussions about what
the acceptance ratio should

00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:29.700
be in order to taking
big enough steps

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:32.390
that you have a chance
to get the weird stuff.

00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:34.140
In this kind of one,
it might be a problem

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:35.880
if you're doing steps,
say, in the dihedral,

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:37.630
you may have to step
quite a long distance

00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:39.180
to find the other lobe.

00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:40.821
So sometimes having
some pre-knowledge

00:14:40.821 --> 00:14:43.320
of what you think the shape of
the things are is a big help.

00:14:46.588 --> 00:14:47.088
Yeah?

00:14:47.088 --> 00:14:49.450
No?

00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:51.866
Sorry, maybe I didn't
answer your question.

00:14:51.866 --> 00:14:52.366
Is that--

00:14:52.366 --> 00:14:53.590
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:54.423
WILLIAM GREEN: Yeah.

00:14:57.100 --> 00:14:58.535
All right.

00:14:58.535 --> 00:14:59.910
All right, so
that's Monte Carlo.

00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:06.500
To Then we talked about
the more difficult problem

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:09.650
of where the probability
distribution is not stationary,

00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:11.900
and in fact, we don't even
have the w written out.

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:14.210
All we have is a
differential equation

00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:16.600
that divides the
probability distribution.

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:20.885
And we did it here for the
case of discrete states,

00:15:20.885 --> 00:15:22.760
and that's the right
one to use, for example,

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:25.530
for the kinetics
equation, if you

00:15:25.530 --> 00:15:28.520
want to get them exactly right.

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:31.000
Now that differential equation
looks really easy, right?

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.519
Just a the times p.

00:15:32.519 --> 00:15:34.310
It's a linear differential
equation system.

00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:36.110
You knew how to do
that one probably

00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:37.979
in your second semester
of undergraduate

00:15:37.979 --> 00:15:39.770
taking differential
equations class, right?

00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:41.725
They did dialyze the matrix.

00:15:41.725 --> 00:15:42.225
Yeah?

00:15:42.225 --> 00:15:44.484
Remember this?

00:15:44.484 --> 00:15:45.650
So that looks really simple.

00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:47.941
But the problem is that the
number of states is so big.

00:15:47.941 --> 00:15:54.070
So have any of you tried problem
two on the optional homework?

00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:56.100
You haven't tried?

00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:57.830
Has anyone even looked at it?

00:15:57.830 --> 00:15:59.413
I know somebody
looked at it because I

00:15:59.413 --> 00:16:00.750
got some question about it.

00:16:00.750 --> 00:16:01.260
All right.

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:02.634
At least one person
looked at it.

00:16:02.634 --> 00:16:06.028
Let me tell you guys briefly
what this problem is.

00:16:06.028 --> 00:16:07.620
It's a really relevant problem.

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:12.660
If you go work for Professor
Jensen, Professor Braatz, maybe

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:16.150
Professor Roman, you might
ed up doing this calculation.

00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:19.590
This is not a crazy calculation.

00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:20.430
It's very simple.

00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:23.550
All they have is like
a chess board of sites

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:25.650
on a catalytic surface.

00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:28.260
And they some number of sites.

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:30.990
And this is what-- if you
take a crystalline catalyst

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:33.840
and cleave it, you'll have
a whole repetitive pattern

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:35.650
on the surface, and
somewhere along there

00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:37.317
is some active site
that does something.

00:16:37.317 --> 00:16:39.150
You can tell that
experimentally because you

00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:41.280
stick that catalyst in the
presence of some gases,

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:42.180
you make products
that you didn't

00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:43.530
make when it wasn't there.

00:16:43.530 --> 00:16:44.890
So it did something.

00:16:44.890 --> 00:16:46.680
So the way people
model this is they

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:48.610
say, OK, there's some
active sites on here,

00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:52.435
and there's probably one of
them per unit cell maybe.

00:16:52.435 --> 00:16:54.120
And the site can
either be empty,

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:56.400
like if I ultra high vacuum,
I pump on it and heat it,

00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:57.840
should be nothing there.

00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:00.840
And then if I expose it to
a little bit of some gas A,

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:04.020
some of the sites might have A
molecules sticking on them now.

00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:07.109
And I also exposed to some sites
gas B. Maybe one of these sites

00:17:07.109 --> 00:17:10.190
might have a B
molecule on it, too.

00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:12.491
And if A and B can react
and make my product,

00:17:12.491 --> 00:17:14.490
C, then maybe they're
sitting next to each other

00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:16.031
and they might react
with each other.

00:17:16.031 --> 00:17:18.970
OK, so this is the whole way
you look at this problem.

00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:23.520
And so all I want to know is, if
I have some A's and B's sitting

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:26.489
on the surface, sort of how
often are they going to react?

00:17:26.489 --> 00:17:28.530
And the problem is a little
bit more complicated.

00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:30.190
It says, well,
suppose I also know

00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:32.773
if I put a whole lot of B on the
surface, what I end up seeing

00:17:32.773 --> 00:17:33.300
is coke.

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:35.430
My whole surface gets
totally coked up.

00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:37.260
So let's model that
by saying, well,

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:39.840
if suppose two B's are next to
each other, then some probably

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:42.140
reacting to turn to
some coke product that

00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:44.614
sticks there permanently and
just poisons the catalyst.

00:17:44.614 --> 00:17:46.104
OK?

00:17:46.104 --> 00:17:47.520
And this is real
life, too, right?

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:49.820
So if you're trying to
run a catalytic process,

00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:51.820
a lot of times, you have
to run with one reagent

00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:55.790
in great excess to keep
the surface kind of clean,

00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:59.737
keep it covered by the
unharmful reactant.

00:17:59.737 --> 00:18:01.820
And then you let little
bits of the other reactant

00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:04.540
come down and react with
the A really quickly.

00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:07.040
But you don't let too much of
the second reactant come down,

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:09.590
because it might cause a
problem like dimerize or coke

00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:10.700
or something.

00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:12.530
OK, so that's the model.

00:18:12.530 --> 00:18:15.230
Some of these guys have
A's, some of them have B's.

00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:18.680
And in the unlikely case
that two of these guys react,

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:21.400
they both turn around and
then turn them into S's.

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:22.044
Coke.

00:18:22.044 --> 00:18:23.780
Soot.

00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:26.840
And then that part's
dead forever after that.

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:28.790
OK, so that's the model.

00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:32.330
So in the case that they
have, they had 100 sites.

00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:35.010
I think it was 10 by 10
if I remember correctly.

00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:37.010
So it's 100 sites, and
each site can either

00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:41.570
be empty, or have an A
molecule, or have a B molecule,

00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:44.180
or have a coke
molecule, S. So there's

00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:48.160
four different states on
each of 100 different sites.

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:51.364
So how many states
are there altogether?

00:18:51.364 --> 00:18:54.450
Its' four to the what?

00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:58.690
100.

00:18:58.690 --> 00:18:59.270
OK.

00:18:59.270 --> 00:19:01.340
So that's a pretty big number.

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:02.440
So that's how many states.

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:06.260
It's about 10 to
the 60th, I think.

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:06.760
All right.

00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:07.840
So this is a very large number.

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:09.490
This is bigger than
Avogadro's number.

00:19:09.490 --> 00:19:10.830
This is really a lot of states.

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:13.300
You wouldn't have thought that
just a stupid little problem

00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:17.530
with just a 10 by 10
piece of catalyst,

00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:19.540
and three different things
that can stick there,

00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:21.730
would give you so many
numbers, but it does.

00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:26.800
So now I have a problem
that if I have--

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:29.680
my p vector is now
a probability that

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:34.410
has a number for each of the
10 to the 60th possible states.

00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:38.790
And then the matrix m is
that number squared, right?

00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:39.940
Dimension.

00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:44.700
So it's 10 to the 120th power
elements inside the matrix m.

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:47.290
So even though the
matrix m is very sparse,

00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:50.040
this might still be a problem,
because 10 to the 120th

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:51.166
is really big, OK?

00:19:51.166 --> 00:19:53.290
And your computer can only
hold 10 to the 9th or 10

00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:57.270
to the 10th numbers in it, so
this is going to be a problem.

00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:02.750
And also that's
not just what p is.

00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:05.060
That's what p is
at this instant,

00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:07.290
say, 1 millisecond
after t naught.

00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:09.660
And then if I wait to 1.1
milliseconds after t naught,

00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:11.060
p will be different.

00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:16.370
So I have 10 to the 60th
numbers that change with time

00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:18.885
in some way that I don't know.

00:20:18.885 --> 00:20:20.790
OK?

00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:26.070
So this is actually a really
hard problem to solve it.

00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:29.392
And so everybody uses
Kinetic Monte Carlo to do it,

00:20:29.392 --> 00:20:31.350
because there's no way
I can possibly even list

00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:33.340
all the elements of p.

00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:37.977
And in fact, if I sample, if
there's 10 to 60th states,

00:20:37.977 --> 00:20:39.810
no matter how good my
sampling algorithm is,

00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:41.570
I'm never going to sample
10 to the 60th states.

00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:44.070
So there's a lot of states I'm
never going to get-- not even

00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:45.637
get one sample of.

00:20:45.637 --> 00:20:47.220
I'm just never going
to encounter them

00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:50.817
at all, because there's
just too many states.

00:20:50.817 --> 00:20:52.150
But anyway, people do it anyway.

00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:54.490
So we go ahead and we'll
do the Gillespie algorithm,

00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:55.530
which you guys--

00:20:55.530 --> 00:20:58.120
we talked about in class.

00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:00.880
Now to compute a
Gillespie trajectory,

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:03.312
we have to compute two
random numbers, right?

00:21:03.312 --> 00:21:05.020
We compute one random
number, it tells us

00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:07.410
how long we wait until
the next thing happens.

00:21:07.410 --> 00:21:09.250
And then we compute a
second random number

00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:11.416
that tells us which of the
many possible things that

00:21:11.416 --> 00:21:13.060
happened actually happened.

00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:15.463
And so if I have a
case like this where I

00:21:15.463 --> 00:21:19.120
had the-- to the original case.

00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:21.690
What can happen, the A
could react with the B,

00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:24.910
the B could react to the B.
The A could come back off.

00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:27.035
The A can move to the
next adjacent site.

00:21:27.035 --> 00:21:29.430
The B can move to the
next adjacent site.

00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:31.410
A lot of things
can happen, right?

00:21:31.410 --> 00:21:34.995
So quite a variety of things can
happen from this initial state.

00:21:34.995 --> 00:21:37.120
And so you have to, if
you're solving this problem,

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:38.286
you have to write that down.

00:21:38.286 --> 00:21:39.668
Yeah, John Paul?

00:21:39.668 --> 00:21:41.644
AUDIENCE: So the
special waiting times

00:21:41.644 --> 00:21:47.325
are [INAUDIBLE] process
where we haven't decided

00:21:47.325 --> 00:21:50.042
there's going to be an
arrival, [INAUDIBLE] arrival

00:21:50.042 --> 00:21:51.417
times by that [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:51.417 --> 00:21:52.250
WILLIAM GREEN: Yeah.

00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:53.360
AUDIENCE: And then we
make something happen.

00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:55.943
But I mean I feel like you could
run the exact same simulation

00:21:55.943 --> 00:21:57.743
without counting the times.

00:21:57.743 --> 00:22:00.274
Get the same answer and
then after the fact come

00:22:00.274 --> 00:22:04.164
and [INAUDIBLE] into the system.

00:22:04.164 --> 00:22:07.570
[INAUDIBLE] doesn't
seem to be [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:08.980
WILLIAM GREEN:
Yes, that's right.

00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:10.270
Yeah, that's true.

00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:12.110
So you only do the
time calculation

00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:13.815
because you care about the time.

00:22:13.815 --> 00:22:15.190
If you don't care
about the time,

00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:16.630
you only care about the
steady-state solution,

00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:18.331
then you can probably
do it some other way.

00:22:18.331 --> 00:22:19.872
AUDIENCE: You don't
need to calculate

00:22:19.872 --> 00:22:21.038
the times inside that.

00:22:21.038 --> 00:22:25.374
You could calculate the
entire state space trajectory

00:22:25.374 --> 00:22:28.580
without any reference
to the time, yeah?

00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:29.756
WILLIAM GREEN: Yes.

00:22:29.756 --> 00:22:31.130
Yeah, so you can
get the sequence

00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:32.630
of all things that happened
if it didn't give you

00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:33.920
the time, because it
doesn't matter, right?

00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:34.640
For the time.

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:36.245
It just means the
sequence of what happened.

00:22:36.245 --> 00:22:36.560
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:38.490
WILLIAM GREEN: The sequence
of states is all that matters.

00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:40.070
But if you want the
kinetic information,

00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:40.960
then you also want
the time, because it

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:43.346
might be it sat in one
state for a million years,

00:22:43.346 --> 00:22:44.220
and the other state--

00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:46.607
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:46.607 --> 00:22:47.440
WILLIAM GREEN: Yeah.

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:48.295
Yeah, that's right.

00:22:48.295 --> 00:22:48.920
Let's go ahead.

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:50.211
OK, so maybe make this cheaper.

00:22:50.211 --> 00:22:52.311
Make it one random number for j.

00:22:52.311 --> 00:22:52.810
No?

00:22:52.810 --> 00:22:53.310
OK.

00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:58.260
All right.

00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:02.110
So things to just keep
in mind about this.

00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:04.920
So the cost here is to
compute in random numbers.

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:06.860
We have to compute at least--

00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:08.810
well, some number
of random numbers.

00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:10.950
I don't know how many.

00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:13.140
And that number depends
on the length of time

00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:17.650
I want to simulate and
what my delta t is.

00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:22.192
Where the delta t is sort
of like the average time

00:23:22.192 --> 00:23:23.400
between the events happening.

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:28.160
It's like one over a
in the [INAUDIBLE]..

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:34.030
And so if that delta
t is very small,

00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:36.124
and my time I want to
simulate is very large,

00:23:36.124 --> 00:23:37.540
that means that
each trajectory is

00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:38.790
going to have a lot of events.

00:23:38.790 --> 00:23:40.623
And that means I'm going
to have to generate

00:23:40.623 --> 00:23:41.816
a lot of random numbers.

00:23:41.816 --> 00:23:43.190
And so generate
one trajectory is

00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:45.250
going to be really expensive.

00:23:45.250 --> 00:23:48.580
On the other hand, if the delta
t were about the same size

00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:50.170
as the total time
I'm simulating,

00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:52.090
then I might only get
one or two events,

00:23:52.090 --> 00:23:54.640
and so I only have to
generate four random numbers

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:56.370
for each sample.

00:23:56.370 --> 00:23:58.410
All right?

00:23:58.410 --> 00:24:00.165
And I just have to
keep in mind that I'm

00:24:00.165 --> 00:24:01.290
going to have a lot of
low probability states

00:24:01.290 --> 00:24:02.400
that I'm not going
to sample at all.

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:04.025
I might even have
some high probability

00:24:04.025 --> 00:24:06.852
states I don't sample, because
I just can't do enough samples.

00:24:06.852 --> 00:24:09.310
And I had the same exact problem
I have with the Metropolis

00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:11.580
Monte Carlo and with all
these stochastic methods

00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:14.100
that the scaling is one
over square root of n.

00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:16.170
So I can get a rough
idea pretty easily,

00:24:16.170 --> 00:24:18.937
but I don't get a really
precise number of anything,

00:24:18.937 --> 00:24:20.770
then I'm going to have
a problem because I'm

00:24:20.770 --> 00:24:23.340
going to have trouble to do
enough samples to really refine

00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:25.750
the number.

00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:30.080
The key thing in this
is that with anything

00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:33.880
like this where I'm going
to have so many states,

00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:36.160
I'm going to run a
lot of trajectories

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:39.610
to get at all-- sample all
the things that can happen.

00:24:39.610 --> 00:24:41.860
And so I'm probably
not going to be

00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:43.300
able to store all
the trajectories

00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:47.370
I ran on my computer, because
I'm going to run so many.

00:24:47.370 --> 00:24:50.340
And so I really want
to compute things

00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:53.010
on the fly, which means I
should decide ahead of time

00:24:53.010 --> 00:24:56.270
all the averages, all the
f's I'm trying to compute.

00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:58.480
So I might only compute
f and f squared.

00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:00.930
And I don't know, whatever
else I want to compute.

00:25:00.930 --> 00:25:03.360
The average value of the
number of A's on the surface.

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:05.735
I mean, there might be a lot
of diagnostics I can compute

00:25:05.735 --> 00:25:07.040
to just check everything's OK.

00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:08.998
Think of that beforehand,
coded to compute them

00:25:08.998 --> 00:25:11.556
as it runs, and then we only
have to store the running

00:25:11.556 --> 00:25:12.930
averages of all
those quantities,

00:25:12.930 --> 00:25:15.179
and I don't have to store
anything about exactly which

00:25:15.179 --> 00:25:16.922
state sequence I hit.

00:25:16.922 --> 00:25:19.377
Is that OK?

00:25:19.377 --> 00:25:20.359
All right.

00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:25.630
Now if you remember,
in this equation,

00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:28.130
there was an initial condition
of the right-hand side, which

00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:30.950
we totally ignored so far.

00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:33.240
But that's actually
pretty important.

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:36.905
And in a lot of real cases,
from your macroscopic continuum

00:25:36.905 --> 00:25:40.720
view of things, you have an idea
of the average value events.

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:42.850
And what you don't know
is about the discreteness

00:25:42.850 --> 00:25:44.230
and you don't know
about the correlations.

00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:45.688
All you know is
sort of an average.

00:25:45.688 --> 00:25:49.060
I expect to have two A's
and three B's in the surface

00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:52.420
or something from the
partial pressure of A and B

00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:56.170
and the binding constants of
A and B. So I have some idea.

00:25:56.170 --> 00:25:58.210
So I think I know
these averages.

00:25:58.210 --> 00:26:04.210
And so what people usually do is
they use a Poisson distribution

00:26:04.210 --> 00:26:07.130
for the probability of
the exact number of A.

00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:09.850
So I suppose I think on average
I'll have two A's. , Well,

00:26:09.850 --> 00:26:14.150
I might have one A, I might
have three A's on the surface.

00:26:14.150 --> 00:26:18.210
And so I'll just use the
Poisson distribution of n

00:26:18.210 --> 00:26:21.760
to get an estimate of
sort of the expected

00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:25.139
width of distributions.

00:26:25.139 --> 00:26:27.430
And so that's the formula
for the Poisson distribution.

00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:31.210
You have to know the average
values of Na, Nb, Nc.

00:26:31.210 --> 00:26:39.190
And then you can see that
the N appears in the--

00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:41.480
on average, N appears
in the exponent

00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:43.786
and in the factorial
[INAUDIBLE]..

00:26:43.786 --> 00:26:44.286
Right?

00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:48.860
And so really every
time you start

00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:51.318
a new trajectory in Kinetic
Monte Carlo, what you should do

00:26:51.318 --> 00:26:53.180
is sample from the
Poisson distribution

00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:55.562
to get a new initial
condition as well.

00:26:55.562 --> 00:26:57.127
OK?

00:26:57.127 --> 00:26:58.710
And that way you're
sampling over both

00:26:58.710 --> 00:27:01.830
all the possible initial
conditions and all

00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:03.420
the possible things
that can happen

00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:06.850
to them to really get the real
average of what you might want.

00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:12.050
All right.

00:27:12.050 --> 00:27:15.970
Now we just realized how
horrible this problem is

00:27:15.970 --> 00:27:17.900
because it has so many states.

00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:20.108
And so then we're going to
have to think immediately,

00:27:20.108 --> 00:27:22.040
what can I do to make
this faster and easier?

00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:24.830
And so here are some
things people do.

00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:28.280
One thing is that
people try to figure out

00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:30.260
what are the really
fast processes,

00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:32.134
and do I care about them.

00:27:32.134 --> 00:27:34.300
And some of the fast
processes, you might say, well,

00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:37.824
like diffusion of
A moving to here,

00:27:37.824 --> 00:27:40.240
and then it moves to here, and
then it moves back to here,

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:41.474
then it moves back to here.

00:27:41.474 --> 00:27:42.640
That's of no interest to me.

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:44.932
I don't care where the A
is bound on the surface.

00:27:44.932 --> 00:27:45.630
All right?

00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:48.740
The only way I care about it
is whether the reacts of the B

00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:50.040
when it's sitting next to it.

00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:52.498
In other respects, I really
don't care about the diffusion.

00:27:52.498 --> 00:27:54.560
So having the time
concept for the diffusion

00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:56.890
be the real time concept
might not be that important.

00:27:56.890 --> 00:27:58.390
So then you can do
different things.

00:27:58.390 --> 00:28:00.480
One thing is you can assume
it's infinitely fast,

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:05.310
and you say, well, every
time I look at a site,

00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:08.790
I assume that this A has a 1/10
chance of being here or here

00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:11.700
or here or here or here,
all these different spots,

00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:14.154
as if it's equilibrated
around all the empty sites.

00:28:14.154 --> 00:28:15.820
That would be one
possible way to do it.

00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:18.850
That's the infinitely
fast diffusion idea.

00:28:18.850 --> 00:28:21.490
Another idea is to say,
well, let's slow down

00:28:21.490 --> 00:28:24.370
the fusion to make
it slower just

00:28:24.370 --> 00:28:25.900
to help out our computation.

00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:27.790
So I say, well, on
average, I might

00:28:27.790 --> 00:28:29.680
get one reaction a millisecond.

00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:32.530
In reality, the diffusion
time is a nanosecond.

00:28:32.530 --> 00:28:34.690
But I don't care about
all that nanosecond stuff.

00:28:34.690 --> 00:28:37.291
Let's pretend that it's
a tenth of a millisecond.

00:28:37.291 --> 00:28:39.040
So it'll still be
pretty much equilibrated

00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:40.840
on the time scale
on the reactions,

00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:43.810
but that way I'll be able
to accelerate my calculation

00:28:43.810 --> 00:28:48.040
by seven orders of magnitude
by going from a nanosecond time

00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:50.252
scale to a tenth of a
millisecond time scale.

00:28:50.252 --> 00:28:52.210
So there's a lot of
different tricks like that.

00:28:52.210 --> 00:28:54.293
If you read a paper that
does Kinetic Monte Carlo,

00:28:54.293 --> 00:28:56.002
you've got to read
exactly what they did.

00:28:56.002 --> 00:28:57.668
But they usually do
something like this,

00:28:57.668 --> 00:28:59.580
because it's just
totally out of hand

00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:03.460
if you try to model
everything perfectly.

00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:05.494
Also, the low
probability events,

00:29:05.494 --> 00:29:06.910
the really low
probability events,

00:29:06.910 --> 00:29:08.129
you're never going to sample.

00:29:08.129 --> 00:29:10.420
So if I have a process that
happens on my catalyst that

00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:14.290
takes 10 hours to happen,
and my main reaction

00:29:14.290 --> 00:29:15.790
happens on a
millisecond time scale,

00:29:15.790 --> 00:29:18.064
I'm never going to be able
to run out to 10 hours.

00:29:18.064 --> 00:29:19.480
So I might as well
just forget it.

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:21.910
So if I know experimentally
that the coking thing only

00:29:21.910 --> 00:29:24.960
happens on 10-hour time scale,
I'd just take it out of there.

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:27.460
And I don't have to clutter up
my calculation with all these

00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:28.360
S's.

00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:31.080
I'm not going to form any of
them in my time scale anyway.

00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:32.470
And so therefore, I cut
the number of states.

00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:34.803
Instead of being 4 to the
100th, now it's 3 to the 100th

00:29:34.803 --> 00:29:37.370
because I got rid
of all the coke.

00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:41.300
And so now I've drastically
reduced the size of my problem.

00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:43.490
Not often you can do
a reduction like this.

00:29:43.490 --> 00:29:48.240
That's a pretty big reduction
in the size of a problem.

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:50.250
All right?

00:29:50.250 --> 00:29:51.660
And then you have
to have an idea

00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:54.180
of what adequate sampling is.

00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:56.160
So you're going to see
some lower probability

00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:58.620
processes compared to some
higher probability ones.

00:29:58.620 --> 00:30:01.080
And you have to know,
when are these low ones so

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:04.010
small that they're
statistical noise.

00:30:04.010 --> 00:30:07.435
And this is the margin
of error problem.

00:30:07.435 --> 00:30:09.810
Do you ever see the polling,
like in the political polls,

00:30:09.810 --> 00:30:14.100
they always say, so-and-so many
people believe in evolution

00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:16.770
plus or minus something, right?

00:30:16.770 --> 00:30:18.720
Well, the way they
get the plus or minus

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:21.630
is from the square root
of the number of samples

00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:24.990
with a positive
result. So the margin

00:30:24.990 --> 00:30:27.715
of error on low probability
things is much larger.

00:30:27.715 --> 00:30:30.090
So the number of people who
believe that Professor Greene

00:30:30.090 --> 00:30:32.440
is God is a very small number.

00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:33.990
So if you find
somebody like that,

00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:36.240
you have to figure they're
within the margin of error,

00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:36.820
right?

00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:37.320
OK?

00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:43.200
But the number of people
who are going to attend 1034

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:45.690
this morning is a
big enough number

00:30:45.690 --> 00:30:48.900
that the margin of error in that
is maybe two or three people.

00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:50.710
It's not going to be 100 people.

00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:51.930
That make sense?

00:30:51.930 --> 00:30:52.860
All right.

00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:55.560
So the more likely the
event is, the more likely

00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:57.120
you'll get a lot
of samples of it

00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:59.661
if you count the errors roughly
the square root of the number

00:30:59.661 --> 00:31:01.680
of samples you
got of that event,

00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:08.310
then the statistical
error in your sample

00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:10.830
of the high probability
events won't be that large.

00:31:10.830 --> 00:31:12.486
Whereas for the low
probability events,

00:31:12.486 --> 00:31:13.652
it could be really gigantic.

00:31:16.114 --> 00:31:17.530
All right, so just
for an example.

00:31:17.530 --> 00:31:20.900
In the main reaction,
A plus B is really fast

00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:22.490
because it's a good catalyst.

00:31:22.490 --> 00:31:24.198
So I'm going to get
a lot of trajectories

00:31:24.198 --> 00:31:25.650
going to show that reaction.

00:31:25.650 --> 00:31:26.860
So that's good.

00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:28.820
And I should get good
samples [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:30.530
But the coking reaction
is really slow.

00:31:30.530 --> 00:31:32.030
At least I hope
it's slow, otherwise

00:31:32.030 --> 00:31:33.380
the catalyst is no good.

00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:35.005
And so if it's really
slow, I might not

00:31:35.005 --> 00:31:37.490
get very many of those guys.

00:31:37.490 --> 00:31:39.890
And so even if I left
it in the calculation,

00:31:39.890 --> 00:31:42.556
I might not be able to reach any
conclusion because I might only

00:31:42.556 --> 00:31:45.050
see one when coking even
out of all of the 100,000

00:31:45.050 --> 00:31:45.900
trajectories I run.

00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:47.900
And so then I won't know
whether to say anything

00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:50.030
about that or not.

00:31:50.030 --> 00:31:52.244
And then if I let the
diffusion in and it's too fast,

00:31:52.244 --> 00:31:53.660
then my delta t
is going to be too

00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:55.970
large, which means
that my CPU time

00:31:55.970 --> 00:31:58.770
to compute a single trajectory
is going to be too large,

00:31:58.770 --> 00:32:00.260
which means that I won't be able
to get good sampling because I

00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:02.192
won't be able to run
very many trajectories.

00:32:02.192 --> 00:32:04.316
So I might want to do
something to get rid of that.

00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:07.640
All right.

00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:09.950
Now there's another method
that a lot of people use.

00:32:09.950 --> 00:32:11.260
I think actually Professor
Swan uses this sometimes.

00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:12.260
Is that correct?

00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:13.250
Yes.

00:32:13.250 --> 00:32:14.780
So this is another method.

00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:18.290
And what it is, is you
solve the equations

00:32:18.290 --> 00:32:21.980
of motion of the atoms or
clumps of atoms typically using

00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:24.020
Newton's equations of motion.

00:32:24.020 --> 00:32:27.740
And typically people use
it using force fields that

00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:29.650
were fitted to some
experimental data,

00:32:29.650 --> 00:32:31.400
and maybe with some
quantum chemistry data

00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:34.575
as well, to get some idea of
the forces between the atoms

00:32:34.575 --> 00:32:36.200
and the force with
which the molecules,

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:40.580
when they bump into each
other, how they interact.

00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:44.840
And typically, it's
done classically

00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:47.300
using Newton's
equations of motions.

00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:48.949
But if you don't
like that, you can

00:32:48.949 --> 00:32:50.490
put in the quantum
mechanical effects

00:32:50.490 --> 00:32:52.670
in a couple of different
ways, and my groups,

00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:54.650
worked them one way called RPMD.

00:32:54.650 --> 00:32:56.540
And you can get
pretty good agreement

00:32:56.540 --> 00:32:58.070
with the quantum
chemical results

00:32:58.070 --> 00:33:01.262
by doing this fancier version
of molecular dynamics.

00:33:01.262 --> 00:33:02.720
So there's some
different equations

00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:05.620
you solve, but
basically the same.

00:33:05.620 --> 00:33:07.702
And so you can do it.

00:33:07.702 --> 00:33:09.160
And there's a nice
algorithm called

00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:13.300
the velocity of Verlet algorithm
that almost everybody uses

00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:14.410
in this field.

00:33:14.410 --> 00:33:16.630
And what's nice
about that one is

00:33:16.630 --> 00:33:19.400
that it can do a lot of steps.

00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:21.810
A lot of steps of
moving the atoms around.

00:33:21.810 --> 00:33:24.670
And after you do a
million steps like that,

00:33:24.670 --> 00:33:26.590
you compute the
energy by adding up

00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:28.173
all the potential
energies and kinetic

00:33:28.173 --> 00:33:29.530
energies of all the atoms.

00:33:29.530 --> 00:33:31.196
And it'll still be
about the same energy

00:33:31.196 --> 00:33:32.290
as you started from.

00:33:32.290 --> 00:33:35.424
Whereas a lot of methods, if
you do the integral like that

00:33:35.424 --> 00:33:37.090
and you calculate the
energy at the end,

00:33:37.090 --> 00:33:38.964
it won't be the same as
energy you calculated

00:33:38.964 --> 00:33:41.110
because the methods have
little round-off errors,

00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:45.560
and they kind of accumulate in
a way that messes up the energy.

00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:48.880
And so this particular
algorithm is

00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:53.080
a nice O to E solver
method that is good for--

00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:56.140
has a property that is good
for conserving the energy.

00:33:59.510 --> 00:34:01.420
And then a lot of
people use a thermostat,

00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:03.190
because they care
about samples that are

00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:04.780
in contact with a thermal bath.

00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:08.500
So you're sampling a few
molecules, maybe 100 molecules

00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:11.900
or 1,000 molecules, but not
10 to the 23rd molecules.

00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:14.260
So you have your 100 molecules
or your 1,000 molecules,

00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:16.551
and you pretend that they're
in contact with some bath,

00:34:16.551 --> 00:34:18.909
and you're watching those
100 molecules wiggle around,

00:34:18.909 --> 00:34:20.620
and their energy is
not exactly conserved

00:34:20.620 --> 00:34:23.929
because they're exchanging
energy with a thermal bath.

00:34:23.929 --> 00:34:26.290
And so there's different
things called thermostats

00:34:26.290 --> 00:34:29.050
which are computer
ways of adjusting

00:34:29.050 --> 00:34:31.300
the velocities of the
atoms periodically

00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:33.310
as if they got a kick
from the thermal bath that

00:34:33.310 --> 00:34:35.159
makes them go up or down.

00:34:35.159 --> 00:34:39.000
And that's very important trying
to do, say, chemical kinetics,

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.587
because their reactions are
so slow that most of the time

00:34:42.587 --> 00:34:44.920
you'll watch the atoms wiggling
around, nothing happens.

00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:48.427
You need the unusual case when
you get a big kick somewhere

00:34:48.427 --> 00:34:50.760
that gives you enough energy
that you overcome a barrier

00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:51.992
to make a reaction happen.

00:34:54.660 --> 00:34:55.159
All right.

00:34:55.159 --> 00:34:57.170
So that's what
molecular dynamics is.

00:34:57.170 --> 00:35:00.960
And numerous people in the
world and in this department

00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:05.030
and on the campus do these
kind of calculations.

00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:08.060
And there's two ways
that they're used.

00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:09.950
One way is used
as an alternative

00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:12.290
to Metropolis Monte Carlo.

00:35:12.290 --> 00:35:14.540
So you're trying to compute
basically multidimensional

00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:16.890
integrals, basically it's
from statistical mechanics

00:35:16.890 --> 00:35:18.470
integrals, more or less.

00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:20.589
And instead of using
Metropolis Monte Carlo,

00:35:20.589 --> 00:35:22.130
you decide to use
molecular dynamics.

00:35:24.650 --> 00:35:29.000
This is a tricky choice
between those two options.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.610
Nice thing about the
molecular dynamics

00:35:31.610 --> 00:35:34.639
is I didn't have to choose any
stepsize, basically, right?

00:35:34.639 --> 00:35:37.180
it's like the time scale was
set by the real physical motions

00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:38.207
of the atoms.

00:35:38.207 --> 00:35:39.790
And if I don't want
to think about it,

00:35:39.790 --> 00:35:42.520
I can just put in, what's
the real physical time scale

00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:44.184
of the vibration of some atoms.

00:35:44.184 --> 00:35:46.600
And I don't have to think about
it at all and just run it.

00:35:51.070 --> 00:35:53.250
But something should be a
little bit thinking about

00:35:53.250 --> 00:35:55.333
is the molecular dynamics
equations we're solving,

00:35:55.333 --> 00:35:58.360
it's really a time
accurate method.

00:35:58.360 --> 00:35:59.950
We actually get real
time dependences.

00:35:59.950 --> 00:36:02.074
We're using the real physical
time, which turns out

00:36:02.074 --> 00:36:03.040
to be pretty darn fast.

00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:04.940
So molecular vibrations
or time scales

00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:07.630
are like tens of femtoseconds.

00:36:07.630 --> 00:36:09.827
And so that's really fast.

00:36:09.827 --> 00:36:11.410
And so you have a
really tiny delta t.

00:36:16.679 --> 00:36:18.970
But if you're trying to
actually compute a steady state

00:36:18.970 --> 00:36:22.900
property, then maybe this
isn't-- it's not necessarily

00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:25.177
the best way to do it, OK?

00:36:25.177 --> 00:36:27.760
Because you're doing something
where you're doing extra effort

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:28.990
to keep the time accuracy.

00:36:28.990 --> 00:36:31.270
It's sort of along the lines
of John Paul's question.

00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:33.799
If you're doing Kinetic Monte
Carlo, if you didn't really

00:36:33.799 --> 00:36:36.340
care about the time, then you
don't have spend time computing

00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:37.424
the time, right?

00:36:37.424 --> 00:36:39.340
And the same thing here
is if you don't really

00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:40.798
care about the
time, then you might

00:36:40.798 --> 00:36:44.140
want to use the Metropolis
Monte Carlo instead,

00:36:44.140 --> 00:36:47.200
because if time's not
really in your problem,

00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:49.930
then you can tailor it,
take steps that don't really

00:36:49.930 --> 00:36:53.272
have to be physical or related
to physical amounts of time,

00:36:53.272 --> 00:36:55.260
and you can still get
the right integral.

00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:57.010
Whereas here, it's
going to necessarily do

00:36:57.010 --> 00:36:59.050
things that are exactly the
physical amount of time.

00:36:59.050 --> 00:37:00.550
And some processes
in the real world

00:37:00.550 --> 00:37:04.030
are pretty darn slow, at least
compared to 100 femtoseconds.

00:37:04.030 --> 00:37:06.880
So you might have
problems trying to compute

00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:09.200
by a time accurate method.

00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:10.780
Now on the other
hand, sometimes you

00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:13.150
want to compute time
dependent properties.

00:37:13.150 --> 00:37:16.660
And this is more or
less an exact simulation

00:37:16.660 --> 00:37:19.460
of what the molecules
really do on the time scale

00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:20.620
that you're simulating.

00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:22.030
So if that's what
you care about,

00:37:22.030 --> 00:37:24.480
like what's happening on the
time scale of picoseconds

00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:26.782
and nanoseconds, this
might be exactly right,

00:37:26.782 --> 00:37:28.990
because you're actually
simulating with a tool that's

00:37:28.990 --> 00:37:31.198
time accurate on the time
scale of what you're really

00:37:31.198 --> 00:37:32.509
trying to measure.

00:37:32.509 --> 00:37:35.050
And so some chemical reactions,
some kinds of energy transfer

00:37:35.050 --> 00:37:36.758
processes, like
Professor Tisdale's group

00:37:36.758 --> 00:37:40.220
has exciton transfers that are
happening on picosecond time

00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:40.890
scales.

00:37:40.890 --> 00:37:43.030
It's tailored to
that kind of problem.

00:37:45.550 --> 00:37:47.460
OK, but this is the limitation.

00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:50.200
So you have to use a
very small delta t.

00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:51.940
Therefore, your total
time is typically

00:37:51.940 --> 00:37:54.670
limited to nanoseconds as
far as you can integrate,

00:37:54.670 --> 00:37:56.062
because you have to--

00:37:56.062 --> 00:37:58.270
if you just count how many
time steps you would need.

00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:04.870
So if you're trying to determine
some kind of static equilibrium

00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:08.070
property, you start
from some initial gas

00:38:08.070 --> 00:38:11.325
at the positions of the atoms
and the initial velocities,

00:38:11.325 --> 00:38:13.200
and then physically, it
takes some time scale

00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:16.239
for that initial gas to relax
to the real equilibrium,

00:38:16.239 --> 00:38:18.030
because you don't know
the real equilibrium

00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:20.100
situation of the system.

00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:22.620
And that time scale, if it's
longer than nanoseconds,

00:38:22.620 --> 00:38:24.078
you're in trouble,
because it's not

00:38:24.078 --> 00:38:27.150
going to be done before
you've done the calculation.

00:38:27.150 --> 00:38:30.206
And you never have even achieved
the equilibrium situation.

00:38:30.206 --> 00:38:32.580
Also, if you have a situation
like that hydrogen peroxide

00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:34.470
case we talked about,
suppose it takes

00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:36.590
a millisecond for
the hydrogen peroxide

00:38:36.590 --> 00:38:39.090
to change confirmation from the
dihedral angle being one way

00:38:39.090 --> 00:38:41.010
and to be the other way.

00:38:41.010 --> 00:38:43.770
If I can only say, well,
simulate for a nanosecond,

00:38:43.770 --> 00:38:45.510
then I'm never going
to see that happen.

00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:48.050
So I'm never going to jump from
the one conformer to the other.

00:38:48.050 --> 00:38:50.330
On the other hand, if I care
what happens inside the one

00:38:50.330 --> 00:38:51.630
conformer, everything
inside there

00:38:51.630 --> 00:38:53.421
probably happens on
nanosecond time scales,

00:38:53.421 --> 00:38:55.620
and so I'll get the
really good sampling

00:38:55.620 --> 00:38:59.420
of what's happening
inside the one conformer.

00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:01.482
And similarly for the
dynamic processes,

00:39:01.482 --> 00:39:03.690
if you have a process that
happens on nanosecond time

00:39:03.690 --> 00:39:06.080
scale, this is really
the ideal way to do it.

00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:08.430
If you have a process that's
happening on millisecond

00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:10.003
or seconds or hours
time scales, then

00:39:10.003 --> 00:39:12.680
this is not really the
way to do it at all.

00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:15.610
And then there's an initial
condition problem with this.

00:39:15.610 --> 00:39:17.710
It's kind of related to
the Kinetic Monte Carlo

00:39:17.710 --> 00:39:19.280
initial condition problem.

00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:21.940
So in the Kinetic
Monte Carlo, we

00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:24.910
had to sample over all the
possible initial conditions.

00:39:24.910 --> 00:39:26.851
We did it with the
Poisson distribution.

00:39:26.851 --> 00:39:28.600
There is a similar
issue here, is how do I

00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:29.808
start the initial conditions?

00:39:29.808 --> 00:39:32.941
Where do I arrange the
atoms to be to start out?

00:39:32.941 --> 00:39:35.440
I really want to sample over
all the different possible ways

00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:37.810
the molecules could be arranged.

00:39:37.810 --> 00:39:39.760
And particularly
if I have some--

00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:41.230
say I have a protein.

00:39:41.230 --> 00:39:45.280
And the protein has some
conformation it likes to sit-in

00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:47.866
and then it can unfold and go
to some other conformation.

00:39:47.866 --> 00:39:49.990
Maybe there's two or three
conformations like this.

00:39:49.990 --> 00:39:51.406
The time scales
for those changes,

00:39:51.406 --> 00:39:52.750
again, might be milliseconds.

00:39:52.750 --> 00:39:53.800
I'm not going to be
able to follow them

00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:55.341
with the molecular
dynamic, so I need

00:39:55.341 --> 00:39:57.330
to have some sampling
method to set me up

00:39:57.330 --> 00:39:58.225
in each of the
different conformations

00:39:58.225 --> 00:39:59.470
that I want to sample.

00:39:59.470 --> 00:40:01.180
And then I can follow
very accurately

00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:03.370
what would happen over
a couple nanoseconds

00:40:03.370 --> 00:40:05.110
after it's in that confirmation.

00:40:05.110 --> 00:40:07.330
But I'll hardly ever
see it actually achieve

00:40:07.330 --> 00:40:11.090
the other confirmation
on the time scale.

00:40:11.090 --> 00:40:15.050
So I guess what I
want to say to you

00:40:15.050 --> 00:40:17.690
guys is these are
different tools for really

00:40:17.690 --> 00:40:18.980
different purposes.

00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:22.280
The Metropolis Monte Carlo,
the Kinetic Monte Carlo,

00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:24.320
and the molecular
dynamics, they're

00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:26.190
all good for some
kinds of problems.

00:40:26.190 --> 00:40:28.400
But none of them is
good for all problems.

00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:35.120
And I often get
journal papers where

00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:38.130
somebody uses the wrong
method for the wrong problem.

00:40:38.130 --> 00:40:39.950
And so I have to reject it.

00:40:39.950 --> 00:40:42.730
I've often had people come that
want to do postdocs for me.

00:40:42.730 --> 00:40:43.760
And they're talking
about their thesis,

00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:46.310
and I see the poor kid has spent
five years of his life using

00:40:46.310 --> 00:40:48.560
the wrong tool for the
problem he's doing.

00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:49.760
It's very sad.

00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:52.190
So don't that be you, OK?

00:40:52.190 --> 00:40:55.180
So don't just use a tool
because you know it.

00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:56.930
Say, does this tool
work for this problem?

00:40:56.930 --> 00:40:58.719
If not, I've got
to find a new tool.

00:40:58.719 --> 00:41:01.260
And just make sure you're using
tools that match the problems

00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:04.334
you want that you're
trying to solve.

00:41:04.334 --> 00:41:05.655
I think that's all I got.

00:41:05.655 --> 00:41:07.410
So I have 10 more
minutes left in class.

00:41:07.410 --> 00:41:08.576
Any questions you guys have?

00:41:12.930 --> 00:41:13.741
Yeah?

00:41:13.741 --> 00:41:16.046
AUDIENCE: Just have one
on weighting functions

00:41:16.046 --> 00:41:20.290
for the Monte Carlo simulations.

00:41:20.290 --> 00:41:23.310
I'm still a little shaky on
how you always determine them.

00:41:23.310 --> 00:41:26.395
It seems like it was given
to us on the problem we

00:41:26.395 --> 00:41:29.430
did on the homework and then
in the example in class,

00:41:29.430 --> 00:41:32.310
you just set it to
an even distribution,

00:41:32.310 --> 00:41:33.642
or a uniform distribution?

00:41:33.642 --> 00:41:34.975
WILLIAM GREEN: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:41:34.975 --> 00:41:37.731
AUDIENCE: How do you choose
what's best, how do you know

00:41:37.731 --> 00:41:38.230
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:41:38.230 --> 00:41:39.063
WILLIAM GREEN: Yeah.

00:41:42.330 --> 00:41:43.684
Well, yes.

00:41:43.684 --> 00:41:44.725
So you get some integral.

00:41:48.618 --> 00:41:50.921
This integral of
g of x something.

00:41:54.010 --> 00:41:55.590
All right?

00:41:55.590 --> 00:41:58.429
Where this is a lot.

00:41:58.429 --> 00:41:59.970
And then you have
to figure out, what

00:41:59.970 --> 00:42:02.670
am I going to do so I
can solve this thing?

00:42:02.670 --> 00:42:07.170
And the clever thing
is to figure out, hmm,

00:42:07.170 --> 00:42:12.810
can I rewrite this as p of
x times f of x, because I

00:42:12.810 --> 00:42:15.090
know how to solve those kind.

00:42:15.090 --> 00:42:16.301
And actually, I don't even--

00:42:16.301 --> 00:42:18.300
Yeah, and even if I don't
know what p is really,

00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:25.110
maybe I can write it as w of x
over some number of integrals

00:42:25.110 --> 00:42:27.840
here.

00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:30.570
That will be my p of x.

00:42:30.570 --> 00:42:34.470
So most of these things you can
do with uniform distributions

00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:36.350
if you want.

00:42:36.350 --> 00:42:38.567
But then your sampling can
be extremely inefficient,

00:42:38.567 --> 00:42:40.150
because you'll sample
a lot of regions

00:42:40.150 --> 00:42:44.272
that have very low probability
of being really there.

00:42:44.272 --> 00:42:45.730
But this is like
a cleverness thing

00:42:45.730 --> 00:42:48.610
about can I figure out
what's that p times f

00:42:48.610 --> 00:42:53.600
that's equal to g that's
going to work the best for me.

00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:57.530
And work the best,
that's a good question.

00:42:57.530 --> 00:43:04.080
So one way of working the best
is, if f is most constant,

00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:06.390
because if f is
perfectly constant,

00:43:06.390 --> 00:43:09.230
then I get the right
answer in the first sample.

00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:10.269
OK?

00:43:10.269 --> 00:43:12.060
So that's one thing is
trying to figure out

00:43:12.060 --> 00:43:13.710
f to be really pretty constant.

00:43:13.710 --> 00:43:15.470
The second one is
to try to figure out

00:43:15.470 --> 00:43:22.100
p that's very sharply focused.

00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:25.040
So I don't need to sample a
lot of x values to get it.

00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:27.290
Now these two are kind of
at odds with each other,

00:43:27.290 --> 00:43:31.250
the sharp p and the flat f.

00:43:31.250 --> 00:43:33.020
Probably again,
probably whole people

00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:34.894
wrote their PhD thesis
in applied mathematics

00:43:34.894 --> 00:43:38.750
about what's the optimal
choice of p and f.

00:43:38.750 --> 00:43:41.494
A lot of times,
I'm not that smart,

00:43:41.494 --> 00:43:43.910
so I just like, if I have a
problem in stat mech, I just--

00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:45.270
I'll always do a
Boltzmann factor.

00:43:45.270 --> 00:43:46.895
It may not really
the best thing to do,

00:43:46.895 --> 00:43:48.740
but that's what I
would do, right?

00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:51.650
And if I was doing
a Bayesian problem,

00:43:51.650 --> 00:43:54.729
it's sort of like the w
is given to you, right?

00:43:54.729 --> 00:43:55.270
Where's that?

00:43:58.410 --> 00:44:02.372
That's the formula I know,
so I'm going to use that w.

00:44:02.372 --> 00:44:04.080
Maybe there's a more
clever way to do it,

00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:06.197
but that's what I
normally would do.

00:44:09.286 --> 00:44:11.410
Actually, one thing that
I don't know if we've ever

00:44:11.410 --> 00:44:16.570
talked about explicitly,
but very important to know,

00:44:16.570 --> 00:44:23.130
is that this kind of formula,
these formulas have w of theta.

00:44:23.130 --> 00:44:26.145
That's the joint probability
that theta one is something,

00:44:26.145 --> 00:44:28.520
and theta two is something,
and theta three is something,

00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:30.560
and theta four is something.

00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:32.704
It's that probably density.

00:44:32.704 --> 00:44:34.120
But a lot of times,
you don't care

00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:35.721
about that level of detail.

00:44:35.721 --> 00:44:37.720
Like you may have only a
few of those parameters

00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:39.100
that matter to you.

00:44:39.100 --> 00:44:41.680
So you really care, you
would like to know p of--

00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:43.697
I don't know, theta
one, theta two.

00:44:43.697 --> 00:44:46.030
And you'd like to get rid of
all the rest of the thetas,

00:44:46.030 --> 00:44:48.156
because these are two thetas
you really care about.

00:44:48.156 --> 00:44:49.571
Maybe these are
the ones you think

00:44:49.571 --> 00:44:51.170
you're controlling
in your experiment,

00:44:51.170 --> 00:44:52.762
you're trying to determine.

00:44:52.762 --> 00:44:54.220
In the other ones,
somebody already

00:44:54.220 --> 00:44:55.780
measured the mass of the
proton, so you really

00:44:55.780 --> 00:44:57.430
don't want to determine
the mass of proton again,

00:44:57.430 --> 00:44:58.750
and you're not going to
really say anything about it

00:44:58.750 --> 00:45:00.100
even if you did.

00:45:00.100 --> 00:45:02.655
If your calculation
says that it made

00:45:02.655 --> 00:45:04.780
the mass of proton a little
bit different than what

00:45:04.780 --> 00:45:06.812
the standard book says,
you might believe that

00:45:06.812 --> 00:45:09.270
in your heart that it's true,
but you're probably not going

00:45:09.270 --> 00:45:10.980
to say it, because you're
like, I better double

00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:11.938
check before I do that.

00:45:11.938 --> 00:45:14.910
But I'm sure that it determines
the length of my reactor,

00:45:14.910 --> 00:45:16.050
because I measured that
with a meter stick,

00:45:16.050 --> 00:45:17.466
and nobody else
knows that number,

00:45:17.466 --> 00:45:20.340
so I'm sure that's the
theta I got that I'm really

00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:21.990
going to be in control of here.

00:45:21.990 --> 00:45:26.790
So oftentimes you do this.

00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:29.520
You want theta one, theta
two, but you actually

00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:35.560
know theta one, theta two,
theta three, quite a few of them

00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:37.680
from my formula.

00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:41.310
And so you can do what's
called a marginal integral.

00:45:41.310 --> 00:45:45.246
Suppose I have-- I don't
know-- theta three, theta four.

00:45:45.246 --> 00:45:48.090
I could do D theta
three, D theta four.

00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:53.620
And this is like integrating
out these degrees of freedom

00:45:53.620 --> 00:45:59.360
to get the probability density
that I want, all right?

00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:02.540
So if you have some case where
you all you care about is

00:46:02.540 --> 00:46:06.574
the variance of
something, and you

00:46:06.574 --> 00:46:07.990
don't care about
all the rest, you

00:46:07.990 --> 00:46:09.460
can kind of integrate them out.

00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:11.172
That's a very handy trick to do.

00:46:15.524 --> 00:46:17.940
Well, you can do similar things
with the Boltzmann things,

00:46:17.940 --> 00:46:20.231
like for example, a lot of
the Boltzmann distributions,

00:46:20.231 --> 00:46:22.197
we don't actually care
about the momenta,

00:46:22.197 --> 00:46:24.780
because what we measure, say,
is like a crystallography thing.

00:46:24.780 --> 00:46:25.863
We see positions of atoms.

00:46:25.863 --> 00:46:27.510
We don't see velocities anyway.

00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:28.180
So a lot of times,
people will just

00:46:28.180 --> 00:46:30.390
integrate all the velocities
out of the problem

00:46:30.390 --> 00:46:31.462
right at the beginning.

00:46:34.342 --> 00:46:35.800
It depends on what
you want, right?

00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:39.714
You're in charge
of your problem.

00:46:39.714 --> 00:46:41.172
Any more questions?

00:46:44.580 --> 00:46:45.235
Yes, Kristen.

00:46:45.235 --> 00:46:47.460
AUDIENCE: OK, well, I
just have an announcement.

00:46:47.460 --> 00:46:47.650
WILLIAM GREEN: OK.

00:46:47.650 --> 00:46:49.540
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
today at office hours,

00:46:49.540 --> 00:46:52.405
we'll talk about KMC, probably
from about 5:00 to 5:30,

00:46:52.405 --> 00:46:54.830
but come any other time
[INAUDIBLE] questions.

00:46:54.830 --> 00:46:57.401
And we just posted a poll
for the final review session.

00:46:57.401 --> 00:46:59.526
It's either going to be
Wednesday evening or Friday

00:46:59.526 --> 00:47:02.472
morning, so if you could vote
on that as soon as possible,

00:47:02.472 --> 00:47:03.804
that would be [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:03.804 --> 00:47:04.970
WILLIAM GREEN: OK, got that?

00:47:04.970 --> 00:47:08.520
So final review is either
Wednesday evening or Friday

00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:10.290
morning, you have to vote.

00:47:10.290 --> 00:47:11.790
And if you come
today, 5:00 to 5:30,

00:47:11.790 --> 00:47:13.934
it'll be all about
Kinetic Monte Carlo.

00:47:13.934 --> 00:47:15.600
And other times today
are about anything

00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:18.210
you want to talk about.

00:47:18.210 --> 00:47:21.030
And the homework solution
will be posted shortly,

00:47:21.030 --> 00:47:25.590
I think, for the last
homework that was graded.

00:47:25.590 --> 00:47:27.170
Anything else?

00:47:27.170 --> 00:47:29.380
All right, good luck as
you study and good luck

00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:31.140
on the exam.
