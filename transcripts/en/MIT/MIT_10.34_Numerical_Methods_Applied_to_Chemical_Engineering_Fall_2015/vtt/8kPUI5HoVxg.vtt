00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.280
JAMES SWAN: OK.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.280
Should we begin?

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.070
Let me remind you,
we switched topics.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.110
We transitioned
from linear algebra,

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:36.880
solving systems of
linear equations,

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.220
to solving systems of
nonlinear equations.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.630
And it turns out, linear algebra
is at the core of the way

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.380
that we're going to
solve these equations.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.239
We need iterative approaches.

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:48.530
These problems are complicated.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.679
We don't know how many
solutions there could be.

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:52.970
We have no idea where those
solutions could be located.

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.460
We have no exact
ways of finding them.

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.140
We use iterative methods to
transform non-linear equations

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.110
into simpler problems, right?

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.849
Iterates of systems
of linear equations.

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:09.292
And the key to that was
the Newton-Raphson method.

00:01:09.292 --> 00:01:11.000
So I'm going to pick
up where we left off

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.708
with the Newton-Raphson
method, and we're

00:01:12.708 --> 00:01:17.420
going find out ways of being
less Newton-Raphson-y in order

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.740
to overcome some difficulties
with the method, shortcomings

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:22.324
of the method.

00:01:22.324 --> 00:01:23.823
There are a number
of them that have

00:01:23.823 --> 00:01:25.340
to be overcome in various ways.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.730
And you sort of choose these
so-called quasi- Newton-Raphson

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:30.670
methods as you need them.

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:31.906
OK, so you'll find out.

00:01:31.906 --> 00:01:33.030
You try to solve a problem.

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.800
And the Newton-Raphson method
presents some difficulty,

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.980
you might resort to a quasi
Newton-Raphson method instead.

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.060
Built into MATLAB is
non-linear equations solver.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.790
fsolve.

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.874
OK, it's going to
happily solve systems

00:01:46.874 --> 00:01:48.540
of nonlinear equations
for you, and it's

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.520
going to use this
methodology to do it.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.920
It's going to use
various aspects

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.990
of these quasi- Newton-Raphson
methods to do it.

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.150
I'll sort of point
out places where

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.430
fsolve will take
from our lecture

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:59.560
and implement them for you.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.684
It will even use some more
complicated methods that

00:02:01.684 --> 00:02:04.850
we'll talk about later on in
the context of optimization .

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.210
Somebody asked an
interesting question,

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.460
which is how many of
these nonlinear equations

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.781
am I going to want
to solve at once?

00:02:12.781 --> 00:02:13.280
Right?

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.590
Like I have a system
of these equations.

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.710
What does a big system of
nonlinear equations look like?

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.210
And just like with
linear equations,

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.170
it's as big as you can imagine.

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.390
So one case you could think
about is trying to solve,

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.450
for example, the steady
Navia-Stokes equations.

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.490
That's a nonlinear
partial differential

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.710
equation for the velocity field
and the pressure in a fluid.

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.480
And a at Reynolds number,
that non-linearity

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.360
is going to present itself
in terms of inertial terms

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.190
that may even dominate the flow
characteristics in many places.

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.650
We'll learn ways of discretizing
partial differential

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.400
equations like that.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.424
And so then, at each point in
the fluid we're interested in,

00:02:53.424 --> 00:02:56.090
we're going to have a non-linear
equation that we have to solve.

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.631
So there's going to be a system
of these non-linear equations

00:02:58.631 --> 00:02:59.870
that are coupled together.

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.453
How many points are
there going to be?

00:03:01.453 --> 00:03:03.155
That's up to you, OK?

00:03:03.155 --> 00:03:05.030
And so you're going to
need methods like this

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.646
to solve that.

00:03:05.646 --> 00:03:06.770
It sounds very complicated.

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.420
So a lot of times
in fluid mechanics,

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.470
we have better ways of
going about doing it.

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.804
But in principle, we've have any
number of nonlinear equations

00:03:13.804 --> 00:03:14.720
that we want to solve.

00:03:18.791 --> 00:03:21.040
We discussed last time, the
new Newton-Raphson method,

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.310
which was based around
the idea of linearization.

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.732
We have these
nonlinear equations.

00:03:25.732 --> 00:03:27.190
We don't know what
to do with them.

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.350
So let's linearize them, right?

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.260
If we have some guess for the
solution, which isn't perfect,

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.150
but it's our best
possible guess.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.880
Let's look at the function
and find a linearized form

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.250
of the function and see where
that linearized form has

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:40.490
an intercept.

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:42.880
And we just have an Ansatz.

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.160
We guess that this
is a better solution

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.660
than the one we had before.

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.610
And we iterate.

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.520
It turns out you can
prove that this sort

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.520
of a strategy-- this
Newton-Raphson strategy

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.440
is locally convergent.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.710
If I start with a guess
sufficiently close to the root,

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:02.410
you can prove mathematically
that this procedure

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.980
will terminate with a
solution at the root, right?

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.510
It's going to approach after
an infinite number of iterates,

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.060
the root.

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.980
That's wonderful.

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.200
It's locally convergent,
not globally convergent.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.230
So this is one of those
problems that we discussed.

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:18.519
Take a second here, right?

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:19.660
Here's your
Newton-Raphson formula.

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:20.868
You've got it on your slides.

00:04:20.868 --> 00:04:23.664
Take a second here and--

00:04:23.664 --> 00:04:24.830
this is sort of interesting.

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.620
Derive the Babylonian
method, right?

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.150
Turns out the Babylonians
didn't know anything

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.608
about Newton-Raphson but they
had some good guesses for how

00:04:30.608 --> 00:04:32.410
to find square roots, right?

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.162
Find the roots of an
equation like this.

00:04:34.162 --> 00:04:36.370
See that you understand the
new Newton-Raphson method

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.860
by deriving the
Babylonian method, right?

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.980
The iterative method for
finding the square root of s

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:43.715
as the root of this equation.

00:04:43.715 --> 00:04:44.410
Can you do it?

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.905
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.404
JAMES SWAN: Yes, you know
how to do this, right?

00:06:09.404 --> 00:06:10.570
So calculate the derivative.

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:12.460
The derivative is 2x.

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:14.790
Here's our formula for
the iterative method.

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:15.610
Right?

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:18.940
So it's f of x
over f prime of x.

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.040
That sets the
magnitude of the stop.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.590
The direction is
minus this magnitude.

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:26.470
It's in one d, so we either
go left or we go right.

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:28.210
Minus sets the direction.

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:29.770
We add that to our
previous guess.

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:31.560
And we have our
new iterate, right?

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.840
You substitute f and f prime,
and you can simplify this

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:38.110
down to the Babylonian
method, which said take

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:41.595
the average of x and s over x.

00:06:41.595 --> 00:06:42.970
If I'm at the
root, both of these

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:45.510
should be square root of s.

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:48.856
And this quantity should
be zero exactly, right?

00:06:48.856 --> 00:06:50.550
And you'll get your solution.

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:53.414
So that's the Babylonian
method, right?

00:06:53.414 --> 00:06:55.580
It's just an extension of
the Newton-Raphson method.

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:57.330
It was pretty good
back in the day, right?

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:00.450
Quadratic convergence to
the square root of a number.

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:03.220
I mentioned early on
computers got really good

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:05.600
in computing square
roots at one point,

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:09.380
because somebody did
something kind of magic.

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:12.290
They came up with a scheme for
getting good initial guesses

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:13.240
for the square root.

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.950
This iterative method has to
start with some initial guess.

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:18.530
If it starts far away,
it'll take more iterations

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:19.320
to get there.

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:21.620
It'll get there, but it's
going to take more iterations

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:22.780
to get there.

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:25.280
That's undesirable if you're
trying to do fast calculations.

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:26.840
So somebody came up
with some magic scheme,

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:28.610
using floating point
mathematics, right?

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:32.720
They masked some of the bits
in the digits of these numbers.

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.120
A special number
to mask those bits.

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.880
They found that using
optimization, it turns out.

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:39.590
And they got really
good initial guesses,

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:40.964
and then it would
take one or two

00:07:40.964 --> 00:07:43.040
iterations with the
Newton-Raphson method

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:45.450
to get 16 digits of accuracy.

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:47.990
That's pretty good.

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:49.620
But good initial
guesses are important.

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:51.495
We'll talk about that
next week on Wednesday.

00:07:51.495 --> 00:07:53.670
Where do those good
initial guesses come from?

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:56.052
But sometimes we don't
have those available to us.

00:07:56.052 --> 00:07:58.010
So what are some other
ways that we can improve

00:07:58.010 --> 00:07:59.093
the Newton-Raphson method?

00:07:59.093 --> 00:08:02.701
That will be the topic
of today's lecture.

00:08:02.701 --> 00:08:04.950
What's the Newton-Raphson
method look like graphically

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:06.060
in many dimensions.

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:08.130
We talked about this Jacobian.

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:10.200
Right, when we're
trying to find the roots

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:13.890
of a non-linear equation
where our function has

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:16.670
more than one dimension-- let's
say it has two dimensions.

00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:18.700
So we have an f 1 and an f 2.

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:21.270
And our unknowns
our x 1 and x 2,

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:23.870
they live in the
x1 x2 plane, right?

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:27.017
f1 might be this say
bowl-shaped function.

00:08:27.017 --> 00:08:28.350
I've sketched out in red, right?

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:29.400
It's three dimensional.

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:31.041
It's some surface here.

00:08:31.041 --> 00:08:31.540
Right?

00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:34.350
We have some initial
guess for the solution.

00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:37.860
We go up to the function, and
we find a linearization of it,

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:40.200
which is not a line but a plane.

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:44.900
And that plane intersects
the x 1, x 2 plane at a line.

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:48.210
And our next best guess is going
to live somewhere on this line.

00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:51.880
Where on this line depends
on the linearization of f 2.

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:52.410
Right?

00:08:52.410 --> 00:08:53.980
So we got to draw the
same picture for f 2,

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:55.521
but I'm not going
to do that for you.

00:08:55.521 --> 00:08:59.400
So let's say, this is where
the equivalent line from f 2

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:02.070
intersects the line
from f 1, right?

00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:04.650
So the two linearizations
intersect here.

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:06.460
That's our next best guess.

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:07.860
We go back up to the curve.

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:10.680
We find the plane that's
tangent to the curve.

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:12.600
We figure out where
it intersects.

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:13.840
The x 1 x 2 plane.

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:14.610
That's a line.

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:17.280
We find the point on the line
that's our next best guess,

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:18.300
and continue.

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:20.370
Finding that
intersection in the plane

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:24.938
is the act of computing
Jacobian inverse times f.

00:09:24.938 --> 00:09:25.438
OK?

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:34.100
If we project down to
just the x 1 x 2 plane,

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:39.750
and we draw the curves where f
1 equals 0, and f 2 equals zero,

00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:40.250
right?

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:42.950
Then each of these iterates,
we start with an initial guess.

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:46.550
We find the planes that are
tangent to these curves,

00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:48.200
or to these surfaces.

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:50.600
And where they intersect
the x 1 x 2 plane.

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:51.745
Those give us these lines.

00:09:51.745 --> 00:09:53.120
And the intersection
of the lines

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:55.050
give us our next approximation.

00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:58.160
And so our function steps
along in the x1 and x2 plane.

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.650
It takes some path
through that plane.

00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:03.692
And eventually it will approach
this locally unique solution.

00:10:03.692 --> 00:10:05.900
So that's what this iterative
method is doing, right?

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:08.750
It's navigating this
multidimensional space, right?

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:12.230
It moves where it
has to to satisfy

00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:14.930
these linearized
equations, right?

00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:18.610
Producing ever better
approximations for a root.

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:19.600
Start close.

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.230
It'll converge fast.

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:22.510
How fast?

00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:23.920
Quadratically.

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:25.540
And you can prove this.

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:26.620
I'll prove it in 1D.

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:28.800
You might think about the
multidimensional case,

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:30.944
but I'll show you
in one dimension.

00:10:30.944 --> 00:10:32.360
So the Newton-Raphson
method said,

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:38.460
xi plus 1 is equal to xi minus
f of xi over f prime of xi.

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:42.340
I'm going to subtract the root,
the exact root from both sides

00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:44.320
of this equation.

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:49.900
So this is the absolute error
in the i plus 1 approximation.

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:52.300
It's equal to this.

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:54.940
And we're going to do
a little trick, OK?

00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:59.280
The value of the function at the
root is exactly equal to zero,

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:03.090
and I'm going to expand
this as a Taylor series,

00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:05.820
about the point xy.

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:11.040
So f of xi plus f prime of
xi times x star minus xi,

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:12.990
plus this second
order term as well.

00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:16.310
Plus cubic terms in this
Taylor expansion, right?

00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:18.480
All of those need to sum
up and be equal to 0,

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:21.250
Because f of x star
by definition is zero.

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:24.000
x star is the root.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.860
And buried in this
expression here

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:33.210
is a quantity which can be
related to xi minus f of xi

00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:34.950
over f prime minus x star.

00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:35.970
It's right here, right?

00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:39.250
xi minus x star,
xi minus x star.

00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:41.820
I've got to divide
through by f prime.

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:44.550
Divide through by f prime,
and I get f over f prime.

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:46.320
That's this guy here.

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:49.890
Those things are equal
in magnitude then,

00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:51.380
to this second order term here.

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:54.240
So they are equal
in magnitude to 1/2,

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:58.380
the second derivative of f,
divided by f prime, times xi

00:11:58.380 --> 00:11:59.939
minus x star squared.

00:11:59.939 --> 00:12:02.230
And then these cubic terms,
well, they're still around.

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:05.610
But they're going to be small as
I get close to the actual root.

00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:07.440
So they're negligible, right?

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:11.115
Compared to these second order
terms, they can be neglected.

00:12:11.115 --> 00:12:12.870
And you should convince
yourself that I

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:15.000
can apply some of
the norm properties

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.740
that we used before, OK?

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:17.730
To the absolute value.

00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:20.940
The absolute values is
the norm of a scalar.

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:23.550
So these norm properties
tell me that this quantity

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:26.940
has to be less than
or equal to, right?

00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:30.150
This ratio of
derivatives multiplied

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:33.990
by the absolute error
in step i squared.

00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:37.590
And I'll divide by that absolute
error in step i squared.

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:40.440
So taking the limit
is i goes to infinity,

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:45.520
this ratio here is
bound by a constant.

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:48.450
This is a definition for
the rate of convergence.

00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:51.930
It says I take the absolute
error in step i plus 1.

00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:55.350
I divide it by the absolute
error in step i squared.

00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:57.540
And it will always be
smaller than some constant,

00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:00.100
as i goes to infinity.

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:02.370
So it converges
quadratically, right?

00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:09.667
If the relative error in step
i was order 10 to the minus 1,

00:13:09.667 --> 00:13:11.880
then the relative
error in step i plus 1

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:14.490
will be order 10 to the minus 2.

00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:16.410
Because they got to be
bound by this constant.

00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:19.240
If the relative error in
step i was 10 to the minus 2,

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:21.590
the relative error
in step i plus 1,

00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:25.170
has got to be order 10 to the
minus 4, or smaller, right?

00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:27.810
Because I square the
quantity down here.

00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:30.450
I get to double the
number of accurate digits

00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:31.500
with each iteration.

00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:37.950
And this will hold so long
as the derivative evaluated

00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:39.660
at the root is
not equal to zero.

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:42.270
If the derivative evaluated
at the root is equal to zero,

00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:43.970
this analysis
wasn't really valid.

00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:49.260
You can't divide by zero
in various places, OK?

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.330
It turns out the
same thing is true

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:52.890
if we do the
multidimensional case.

00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:54.960
I'll leave it to you to
investigate that case.

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:57.334
I think it's interesting for
you to try and explore that.

00:13:57.334 --> 00:13:59.940
It follows the 1D model
I showed you before.

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:02.930
But the absolute error
in iterate i plus 1,

00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:05.070
divided by the absolute
error in iterate i--

00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:06.150
here's a small typo here.

00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:07.590
Cross out that plus 1, right?

00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:10.917
The absolute error
in iterate i squared

00:14:10.917 --> 00:14:12.375
is going to be
bound by a constant.

00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:17.670
And this will be true so
long as the determinant

00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:20.516
at the Jacobian at the
root is not equal to zero.

00:14:20.516 --> 00:14:22.140
We know the determinant
of the Jacobian

00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:26.194
plays the role of the
derivative in the 1D case.

00:14:26.194 --> 00:14:27.610
When the Jacobian
is singular, you

00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:31.150
can show that linear convergence
is going to occur instead.

00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:32.540
So it will still converge.

00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:34.570
It's not necessarily a
problem that the Jacobian

00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:36.190
becomes singular at the root.

00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:39.120
But you're going to lose your
rate of quadratic convergence.

00:14:42.381 --> 00:14:43.880
And this rate of
convergence is only

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:46.390
guaranteed if we start
sufficiently close to the root.

00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:49.610
So good initial guesses,
that's important.

00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:51.230
We have a locally
convergent method.

00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:52.490
Bad initial guesses?

00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:55.501
Well, who knows where
this iterative method is

00:14:55.501 --> 00:14:56.000
going to go.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.470
There's nothing to
guarantee that it's

00:14:57.470 --> 00:14:58.430
going to converge even.

00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:00.500
Right It may run away someplace.

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:03.540
Here are a few examples of
where things can go wrong.

00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:07.010
So if I have a local
minima or maxima,

00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:10.940
I might have an iterate where
I evaluate the linearization,

00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:12.770
and it tells me my
next best approximation

00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:16.140
is on the other side of
this minima or maxima.

00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:18.630
And then I go up, and I
get the linearization here.

00:15:18.630 --> 00:15:20.670
And it tells me, oh, my
next best approximation

00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:21.545
is on the other side.

00:15:21.545 --> 00:15:24.000
And this method could
bounce back and forth

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.839
in here for as long
as we sit and wait.

00:15:27.839 --> 00:15:29.880
It's locally convergent,
not globally convergent.

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:33.330
It can get hung up in
situations like this.

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:35.250
Asymptotes are a problem.

00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:37.980
I have an asymptote,
which presumably

00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:40.800
has an effective root
somewhere out here at infinity.

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:42.540
Well, my solution
would like to follow

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:45.450
the linearization, the
successive linearizations all

00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:47.580
the way out along
this asymptote, right?

00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:52.470
So my iterates may blow up
in an uncontrolled fashion.

00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:54.400
You can also end
up with funny cases

00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:58.590
where our Newton-Raphson
steps continually

00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:00.090
overshoot the roots.

00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:05.490
So they can be functions who
have a power loss scaling

00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:11.640
right near the root, such that
the derivative doesn't exist.

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:12.820
OK?

00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:17.080
So here the derivative of this
thing, if s is smaller than 1,

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:19.720
and x equals zero, it
won't exist, right?

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:22.580
There isn't a derivative
that's defined there.

00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:25.090
And in those cases, you can
often wind up with overshoot.

00:16:25.090 --> 00:16:29.320
So I'll take a linearization,
and I'll shoot over the root.

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:31.450
And I'll go up and I'll
take my next linearization,

00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:33.366
I'll shoot back on the
other side of the root.

00:16:33.366 --> 00:16:36.530
And depending on the power of s
associated with this function,

00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:38.440
it may diverge, right?

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:40.830
I may get further and
further away from the root,

00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:44.140
or it may slowly converge
towards that root.

00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:45.477
But it can be problematic.

00:16:48.205 --> 00:16:51.910
Here's another
problem that crops up.

00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:54.620
Sometimes people talk
about basins of attraction.

00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:58.180
So here's a two-dimensional,
non-linear equation

00:16:58.180 --> 00:16:59.850
I want to find the roots for.

00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:01.420
It's cubic in
nature, so it's got

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:04.730
three roots, which are indicated
by the stars in the x1 x 2

00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:06.839
plane.

00:17:06.839 --> 00:17:09.589
And I've taken a number of
different initial guesses

00:17:09.589 --> 00:17:13.160
from all over the
plane and I've asked--

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:15.980
given that initial guess, using
the Newton-Raphson method,

00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:20.000
which root do I find?

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.190
So if you see a dark
blue color like this,

00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:25.190
that means initial guesses
there found this root.

00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:26.690
If you see a medium
blue color, that

00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:28.099
means they found this root.

00:17:28.099 --> 00:17:31.110
See a light blue color, that
means they found this root.

00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:36.140
And this is a relatively
simple function, relatively low

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:40.010
dimension, but the plane
here is tilled by--

00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:40.730
it's not tiled.

00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:41.960
It's filled with a fractal.

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:44.160
These basins of attraction
are fractal in nature.

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:47.120
Which means that I
could think that I'm

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:49.310
starting with a
solution rate here

00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:52.070
that should converge to this
green root because it's close.

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:53.875
But it actually goes over here.

00:17:53.875 --> 00:17:56.000
And if I change that initial
guess by a little bit,

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.870
it actually pops up to this
root over here instead.

00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:03.170
It's quite difficult to
predict which solution

00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:07.060
you're going to converge to.

00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:07.910
Yes?

00:18:07.910 --> 00:18:09.830
AUDIENCE: And in this case, you
knew how many roots there are.

00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:10.496
JAMES SWAN: Yes.

00:18:10.496 --> 00:18:12.042
AUDIENCE: Often
you wouldn't know.

00:18:12.042 --> 00:18:14.630
So you find one,
and you're happy.

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:15.130
Right?

00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:18.539
You're happy because
[INAUDIBLE] physical.

00:18:18.539 --> 00:18:20.000
Might be the wrong one.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.740
JAMES SWAN: So this the problem.

00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:30.770
I think this is about the
minimum level of complexity

00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:31.404
you need.

00:18:31.404 --> 00:18:33.320
Which is not very complex
at all in a function

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:36.740
to get these sorts of
basins of attraction.

00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:38.210
Polynomial equations
are ones that

00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:40.060
really suffer from
this especially,

00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:42.170
but it's a problem in general.

00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:44.300
You often don't know.

00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:46.250
I'll show you quasi
Newton-Raphson methods

00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:48.460
that help fix some
of these problems.

00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:50.270
How about other problems?

00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:52.240
It's good to know where
the weaknesses are.

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:54.870
Newton-Raphson sounds great,
but where are the weaknesses?

00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:55.370
Let's see.

00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:59.890
The Jacobian-- might not be
easy to calculate analytically,

00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:00.430
right?

00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:02.440
So far we've written
down analytical forms

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:03.460
for the Jacobian.

00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:06.070
We've had simple functions.

00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:08.299
But maybe it's not easy
to calculate analytically.

00:19:08.299 --> 00:19:10.090
You should think about
what are the sources

00:19:10.090 --> 00:19:12.400
for this function,
f of x, that we're

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:14.470
trying to find the roots for.

00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:16.210
Also we got to
invert the Jacobian,

00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:17.380
and we know that's a matrix.

00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:19.570
And matrices which have a
lot of dimensions in them

00:19:19.570 --> 00:19:21.160
are complicated to invert.

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:23.509
There's a huge
amount of complexity,

00:19:23.509 --> 00:19:25.675
computational complexity,
in doing those inversions.

00:19:25.675 --> 00:19:28.970
It can take a long
time to do them.

00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:32.350
It may undesirable to have
to constantly be solving

00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:34.770
a system of linear equations.

00:19:34.770 --> 00:19:39.500
So might think about some
options for mitigating this.

00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:41.972
Sometimes it won't
converge at all?

00:19:41.972 --> 00:19:42.930
Or to the nearest root.

00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:45.904
This is this overshoot, or
basin of attraction problem.

00:19:45.904 --> 00:19:47.570
And we'll talk about
these modifications

00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:48.770
to correct these issues.

00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:50.190
They come with a penalty though.

00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:50.969
OK?

00:19:50.969 --> 00:19:52.760
So Newton-Raphson was
based around the idea

00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:53.870
of linearization.

00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:57.010
If we modify that
linearization, we're

00:19:57.010 --> 00:20:00.070
going to lose some of
these great benefits

00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:02.570
of the Newton-Raphson method,
namely that it's quadratically

00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:03.320
convergent, right?

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:05.632
We're going to make some
changes to the method,

00:20:05.632 --> 00:20:08.150
and it's not going to converge
quadratically anymore.

00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:10.280
It's going to slow
down, but maybe we'll

00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:13.280
be able to rein in the method
and make it converge either

00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:15.980
to the roots we want it to
converge to or converge more

00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:19.250
reliably than it would before.

00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:23.150
Maybe we'll be able to actually
do the calculation faster,

00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:26.180
even though it may
require more iterations.

00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:28.070
Maybe we can make each
iteration much faster

00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:30.565
using some of these methods.

00:20:30.565 --> 00:20:33.190
OK so here are the three things
that we're going to talk about.

00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:35.730
We're going to talk about
approximating the Jacobian

00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:37.230
with finite differences.

00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:38.730
We're talking about
Broyden's method

00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:40.647
for approximating the
inverse of the Jacobian.

00:20:40.647 --> 00:20:42.563
And we're going to talk
about something called

00:20:42.563 --> 00:20:43.981
damped Newton-Raphson methods.

00:20:43.981 --> 00:20:45.730
Those will be the three
topics of the day.

00:20:48.772 --> 00:20:49.980
So here's what I said before.

00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:51.480
Analytical calculations
of Jacobian

00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:53.620
requires analytical
formulas for f.

00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:56.070
And for functions of a
few dimensions, right?

00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:58.620
These calculations
are not too tough.

00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:00.780
For functions of
many dimensions,

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:03.710
this is tedious at best.

00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:05.880
Error prone, at worst.

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:09.190
Think about even something like
10 equations for 10 unknowns.

00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:12.717
If your error rate is
1%, well, you're shot.

00:21:12.717 --> 00:21:14.550
There's a pretty good
chance that you missed

00:21:14.550 --> 00:21:15.900
one element of the Jacobian.

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:17.906
You made a mistake
somewhere in there.

00:21:17.906 --> 00:21:19.530
And now you're not
doing Newton-Raphson

00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:21.654
You're doing some other
iterative method that isn't

00:21:21.654 --> 00:21:24.540
the one that you intended.

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:26.745
There are a lot of times
where you-- maybe you

00:21:26.745 --> 00:21:30.570
have an analytical formula for
some of these f's, but not all

00:21:30.570 --> 00:21:31.980
of them.

00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:34.710
So where can these
functionalities come from?

00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:37.950
We've seen some cases, where
you have physical models.

00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:40.804
Thermodynamic models that
you can write down by hand.

00:21:40.804 --> 00:21:43.220
But where are other places
that these functions come from?

00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:47.498
Ideas?

00:21:47.498 --> 00:21:50.426
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:50.426 --> 00:21:51.890
JAMES SWAN: Oh, good.

00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:53.714
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:53.714 --> 00:21:54.630
JAMES SWAN: Beautiful.

00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:56.754
So this is going to be the
most common case, right?

00:21:56.754 --> 00:22:00.720
Maybe you want to use some
sort of simulation code, right?

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:01.719
To model something.

00:22:01.719 --> 00:22:03.260
It's somebody else's
simulation code.

00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:06.240
They're an expert at doing
finite element modeling.

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:09.900
But the output is this f
that you're interested,

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:12.930
and the input to the
simulation are these x's.

00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:15.960
And you want to find the roots
associated with this problem

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:18.574
that you're solving via
the simulation code, right?

00:22:18.574 --> 00:22:20.490
This is pretty important
being able to connect

00:22:20.490 --> 00:22:23.420
different pieces of
software together.

00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:27.910
Well, there's no analytical
formula for f there.

00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:28.600
OK?

00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:29.990
You're shot.

00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:32.180
So it may come from
results of simulations.

00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:33.710
This is extremely common.

00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:36.550
It could come from
interpretation of data.

00:22:36.550 --> 00:22:38.630
So you may have a
bunch of data that's

00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:41.780
being generated by some physical
measurement or a process,

00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:44.240
either continuously or
you just have a data set

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:47.030
that's available to you.

00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:50.060
But these function
values are often not,

00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:52.250
they're not things that
you know analytically.

00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:56.730
It may also be the case that,
oh, man, even Aspen, you're

00:22:56.730 --> 00:22:59.157
going to wind up solving
systems of nonlinear equations.

00:22:59.157 --> 00:23:00.990
It's going to use the
Newton-Raphson method.

00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:03.750
Aspen's going to have lots
of these formulas in it

00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:05.250
for functions.

00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:07.440
Whose going in by
hand and computing

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:11.010
the derivatives of all
these functions for aspen?

00:23:11.010 --> 00:23:13.920
MATLAB has a nonlinear
equation solver in it.

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:15.900
You give it the
function, and it'll

00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:18.000
find the root of the
equation, given a guess.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.833
It's going to use the
Newton-Raphson method.

00:23:19.833 --> 00:23:23.621
Whose computing the
Jacobian for MATLAB?

00:23:23.621 --> 00:23:24.120
You can.

00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:26.161
You can compute it by
hand, and give it an input.

00:23:26.161 --> 00:23:28.987
Sometimes that's a
really good thing to do.

00:23:28.987 --> 00:23:31.070
But sometimes, we don't
have that available to us.

00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:33.320
So we need alternative ways
of computing the Jacobian.

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:37.410
The simplest one is a finite
difference approximation.

00:23:37.410 --> 00:23:40.200
So you recall the definition
of the derivative.

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:45.570
It's the limit of this
difference, f of x plus epsilon

00:23:45.570 --> 00:23:49.680
minus f of x divided by epsilon,
as epsilon goes to zero.

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:52.260
There's an error in
this approximation

00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:55.210
for the derivative with a
finite value for epsilon,

00:23:55.210 --> 00:23:58.320
which is proportional
to epsilon.

00:23:58.320 --> 00:23:59.970
So choose a small
value of epsilon.

00:23:59.970 --> 00:24:04.080
You'll get a good approximation
for the derivative.

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:06.162
It turns out the accuracy
depends on epsilon,

00:24:06.162 --> 00:24:07.620
but kind of in a
non-intuitive way.

00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:08.786
And here's a simple example.

00:24:08.786 --> 00:24:12.270
So let's compute the
derivative of f of x equals e

00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:14.520
the x, which is e to the x.

00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:17.670
Let's evaluate it at x equals 1.

00:24:17.670 --> 00:24:18.170
So

00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:21.240
F prime of 1 is e the 1,
which should approximately

00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:26.740
be e to the 1 plus epsilon
minus e to the 1 over epsilon.

00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:29.930
And here I've done
this calculation.

00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:32.600
And I've asked, what's
the absolute error

00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:35.810
in this calculation by taking
the difference between this

00:24:35.810 --> 00:24:39.290
and this, for different
values of epsilon.

00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:42.180
You can see initially,
as epsilon gets smaller,

00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:44.980
the absolute error goes down
in proportion to epsilon.

00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:47.000
10 to the minus 3,
10 to the minus 3.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.190
10 to the minus 4,
10 to the minus 4.

00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:51.380
10 to the minus 8,
10 to the minus 8.

00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:52.660
10 to the minus 9.

00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:53.960
10 to the minus 7.

00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:55.390
10 to the minus 10.

00:24:55.390 --> 00:24:56.380
And 10 to the minus 6.

00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:58.860
So it went down,
and it came back up.

00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:02.060
But that's not what this formula
told us should happen, right?

00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:02.849
Yes?

00:25:02.849 --> 00:25:04.316
AUDIENCE: So just to be sure.

00:25:04.316 --> 00:25:07.250
That term in that
column on the right?

00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:08.028
JAMES SWAN: Yes?

00:25:08.028 --> 00:25:10.291
AUDIENCE: It says
exponential 1, but it

00:25:10.291 --> 00:25:11.890
represents the approximation?

00:25:11.890 --> 00:25:15.050
JAMES SWAN: Exponential 1 is
exponential 1. f prime of 1

00:25:15.050 --> 00:25:16.310
is our approximation here.

00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:16.820
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:18.403
JAMES SWAN: Sorry
that that's unclear.

00:25:18.403 --> 00:25:23.370
Yes, so this is the absolute
error in this approximation.

00:25:23.370 --> 00:25:25.660
So it goes down,
and then it goes up.

00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:26.590
Is that clear now?

00:25:26.590 --> 00:25:27.210
Good.

00:25:27.210 --> 00:25:28.730
OK, why does it go down?

00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:31.280
It goes down because our
definition of the derivative

00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:33.140
says it should go down.

00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:37.610
At some point, I've actually
got to do these calculations

00:25:37.610 --> 00:25:40.370
with high enough accuracy
to be able to perceive

00:25:40.370 --> 00:25:44.450
the difference between e to
the 1 plus, 10 to the minus 9,

00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:47.030
and e to the 1.

00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:49.640
So there is a truncation
error in the calculation

00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:54.810
of this difference that reduces
my accuracy at a certain level.

00:25:54.810 --> 00:25:57.650
There's a heuristic
you can use here, OK?

00:25:57.650 --> 00:25:59.087
You want to set
this epsilon when

00:25:59.087 --> 00:26:00.920
you do this finite
difference approximation,

00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:02.510
to be the square
root of the machine

00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:06.830
precision times the magnitude
of x, the point at which you're

00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:08.340
trying to calculate
this derivative.

00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:10.220
So that's, usually
we're double precision.

00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:12.200
So this is something
like 10 to the minus 8

00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:13.899
times the magnitude of x.

00:26:13.899 --> 00:26:14.690
That's pretty good.

00:26:14.690 --> 00:26:15.810
That holds true here.

00:26:15.810 --> 00:26:16.310
OK?

00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:20.140
You can test it out on
some other functions.

00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:21.952
If x is 0, or very small.

00:26:21.952 --> 00:26:23.410
We don't want a
relative tolerance.

00:26:23.410 --> 00:26:26.110
We've got to choose an
absolute tolerance instead.

00:26:26.110 --> 00:26:29.080
Just like we talked about
with the step norm criteria.

00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:30.670
So one has to be a
little bit careful

00:26:30.670 --> 00:26:31.850
in how you implement this.

00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:34.570
But this is a good guide, OK?

00:26:34.570 --> 00:26:37.690
A good way to think about how
the error is going to go down,

00:26:37.690 --> 00:26:40.180
and where it's going to
start to come back up.

00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:41.350
Make sense?

00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:43.880
Good.

00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:46.527
OK, so how do you compute
elements of the Jacobian then?

00:26:46.527 --> 00:26:48.360
Well, those are all
just partial derivatives

00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:53.100
of the function with respect to
one of the unknown variables.

00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:56.430
So partial f i with
respect to x j is just

00:26:56.430 --> 00:27:03.310
f i at x plus some
epsilon deviation of x

00:27:03.310 --> 00:27:04.830
in its j-th component only.

00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:08.710
So this is like a unit
vector in the j direction,

00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:13.090
or associated with the j-th
element of this vector.

00:27:13.090 --> 00:27:15.475
Minus f i of x divided
by this epsilon.

00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:21.590
Equivalently, you'd
have to do this for f i.

00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:23.780
You can compute all the
columns of the Jacobian

00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:28.220
very quickly by calling
f of x plus epsilon

00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:30.260
minus f of x over epsilon.

00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:33.710
Just evaluate your vector-valued
function at these different

00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:34.349
x's.

00:27:34.349 --> 00:27:36.140
Take the difference,
and that will give you

00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:40.940
column j of your Jacobian.

00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:43.010
So how many function
evaluations does it

00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:47.549
take to calculate the
Jacobian at a single point?

00:27:47.549 --> 00:27:49.590
How many times do I have
to evaluate my function?

00:27:56.492 --> 00:27:58.960
Yeah?

00:27:58.960 --> 00:27:59.634
AUDIENCE: 2 n.

00:27:59.634 --> 00:28:00.550
JAMES SWAN: 2n, right.

00:28:00.550 --> 00:28:05.530
So if I have n, if I
have n elements to x,

00:28:05.530 --> 00:28:09.740
I've got to make two function
calls per column of j.

00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:11.986
There's going to
be n columns in j.

00:28:11.986 --> 00:28:15.910
So 2n function evaluations
to compute the Jacobian

00:28:15.910 --> 00:28:17.290
at a single point.

00:28:17.290 --> 00:28:18.520
Is that really true though?

00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:19.510
Not quite.

00:28:19.510 --> 00:28:21.207
f of x is f of x.

00:28:21.207 --> 00:28:22.790
I don't have to
compute it every time.

00:28:22.790 --> 00:28:25.090
I just compute f of x once.

00:28:25.090 --> 00:28:28.460
So it's really like n plus
1 that I have to do, right?

00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:31.942
N plus a function evaluations
to compute this thing.

00:28:31.942 --> 00:28:33.710
I actually got to
compute them though.

00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:37.070
Function evaluations
may be really expensive.

00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:40.136
Suppose you're doing some sort
of complicated simulation,

00:28:40.136 --> 00:28:41.510
like a finite
element simulation.

00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:44.966
Maybe it takes minutes to
generate a function evaluation.

00:28:44.966 --> 00:28:46.340
So it can be
expensive to compute

00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:48.110
the Jacobian in this way.

00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:51.500
Just be expensive to
compute the Jacobian.

00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:53.780
How is approximation
of Jacobian going

00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:55.200
to affect the convergence?

00:28:58.289 --> 00:29:00.330
What's going to happen to
the rate of convergence

00:29:00.330 --> 00:29:02.160
of our method?

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:04.890
It's going to go down, right?

00:29:04.890 --> 00:29:06.959
It's probably not
going to be linear.

00:29:06.959 --> 00:29:08.250
It's not going to be quadratic.

00:29:08.250 --> 00:29:10.230
It's going to be some
super linear factor.

00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:12.450
It's going to depend on how
accurate the Jacobian is.

00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:17.960
How sensitive the
function is near the root.

00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:20.940
But it's going to reduce
the accuracy of the method,

00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:23.880
or the convergence rate of
the method by a little bit.

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:25.230
That's OK.

00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:27.330
So this is what MATLAB does.

00:29:27.330 --> 00:29:29.460
It uses a finite
difference approximation

00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:30.210
for your Jacobian.

00:29:30.210 --> 00:29:32.293
When you give it a function,
and you don't tell it

00:29:32.293 --> 00:29:33.300
the Jacobian explicitly.

00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:39.237
Here's an example of how
to implement this yourself.

00:29:39.237 --> 00:29:40.820
So I've got to have
some function that

00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:42.736
does whatever this
function is supposed to do.

00:29:42.736 --> 00:29:45.402
It takes as input x and
it gives an output f.

00:29:45.402 --> 00:29:47.480
And then the Jacobian, right?

00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:48.740
It's a matrix.

00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:50.990
So we initialize this matrix.

00:29:50.990 --> 00:29:53.990
We loop over each
of the columns.

00:29:53.990 --> 00:29:57.350
We compute the
displacement right?

00:29:57.350 --> 00:30:00.512
The deviation from
x for each of these.

00:30:00.512 --> 00:30:01.970
And then we compute
this difference

00:30:01.970 --> 00:30:04.674
and divide it by epsilon.

00:30:04.674 --> 00:30:06.590
I haven't done everything
perfect here, right?

00:30:06.590 --> 00:30:08.150
Here's an extra
function evaluation.

00:30:08.150 --> 00:30:10.400
I could just calculate
the value of the function

00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:12.486
at x before doing the loop.

00:30:12.486 --> 00:30:14.570
I've also only used a
relative tolerance here.

00:30:14.570 --> 00:30:16.392
I'm going to be in
trouble if xi is 0.

00:30:16.392 --> 00:30:18.350
It's going to be a problem
with this algorithm.

00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:22.620
These are the little details
one has to pay attention to.

00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:24.560
But it's a simple enough
calculation to do.

00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:25.850
Loop over the columns, right?

00:30:25.850 --> 00:30:27.290
Compute these differences.

00:30:27.290 --> 00:30:28.130
Divide by epsilon.

00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:30.980
You have your approximation
for the Jacobian.

00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:33.890
I've got to do that at
every iteration, right?

00:30:33.890 --> 00:30:36.680
Every time x is updated, I've
got to recompute my Jacobian.

00:30:40.762 --> 00:30:41.470
That's it though.

00:30:41.470 --> 00:30:44.310
All right, that's one way
of approximating a Jacobian.

00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:47.370
There s a method that's used in
one dimension called the Secant

00:30:47.370 --> 00:30:49.380
method.

00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:51.570
It's a special case of
the Newton-Raphson method

00:30:51.570 --> 00:30:54.090
and uses a coarser approximation
for the derivative.

00:30:54.090 --> 00:30:59.600
It says, I was taking these
steps from xi minus 1 to xi.

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:01.200
And I knew the
function values there.

00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:03.234
Maybe I should just
compute the slope

00:31:03.234 --> 00:31:05.400
of the line that goes through
those points, and say,

00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:07.690
that's my approximation
for the derivative.

00:31:07.690 --> 00:31:08.190
Why not?

00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:10.020
I have the data available to me.

00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:12.420
It seems like a
sensible thing to do.

00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:20.590
So we replace f prime at x1 with
f of xi minus f of x i minus 1.

00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:24.077
Down here we put xi
minus xi minus 1 up here.

00:31:24.077 --> 00:31:25.910
That's our approximation
for the derivative,

00:31:25.910 --> 00:31:28.010
or the inverse of
the derivative.

00:31:28.010 --> 00:31:31.460
This can work, it
can work just fine.

00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:33.050
Can it be extended
to many dimensions?

00:31:33.050 --> 00:31:34.700
That's an interesting
question, though?

00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:35.870
This is simple.

00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:37.880
In many dimensions,
not so obvious right?

00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:42.575
If I know xi, xi minus 1.
f of xi, f of si minus 1.

00:31:42.575 --> 00:31:46.841
Can I approximate the Jacobian?

00:31:46.841 --> 00:31:47.590
What do you think?

00:31:55.034 --> 00:31:56.450
Does it strike you
as though there

00:31:56.450 --> 00:31:59.402
might be some fundamental
difficulty to doing that?

00:32:09.704 --> 00:32:10.204
Yeah?

00:32:10.204 --> 00:32:12.659
AUDIENCE: Could you
approximate the gradient?

00:32:12.659 --> 00:32:19.533
[INAUDIBLE] gradient of f at x.

00:32:19.533 --> 00:32:20.855
JAMES SWAN: OK.

00:32:20.855 --> 00:32:24.015
AUDIENCE: But I'm sure
if you whether you

00:32:24.015 --> 00:32:27.440
can go backwards from the
gradient in the Jacobian.

00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:29.160
JAMES SWAN: OK.

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:31.656
So, let's-- go ahead.

00:32:31.656 --> 00:32:33.534
AUDIENCE: Perhaps
the difficulty is,

00:32:33.534 --> 00:32:35.200
I mean when they're
just single values--

00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:35.410
JAMES SWAN: Yeah.

00:32:35.410 --> 00:32:38.062
AUDIENCE: You can think of
[INAUDIBLE] derivative, right?

00:32:38.062 --> 00:32:39.190
JAMES SWAN: Yeah.

00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:41.550
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
get really big,

00:32:41.550 --> 00:32:44.190
you get a vector of
a function at xi,

00:32:44.190 --> 00:32:47.290
a vector of a function of
xi minus 1 or whatever.

00:32:47.290 --> 00:32:49.343
Vectors of these x's.

00:32:49.343 --> 00:32:52.377
And so if you're [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:52.377 --> 00:32:54.460
JAMES SWAN: Yeah, so how
do I divide these things?

00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:55.430
That's a good question.

00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:58.210
The Jacobian-- how much
information content

00:32:58.210 --> 00:32:59.470
is in the Jacobian?

00:32:59.470 --> 00:33:01.690
Or how many
independent quantities

00:33:01.690 --> 00:33:04.010
are built into the Jacobian?

00:33:04.010 --> 00:33:05.360
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:06.440
JAMES SWAN: And squared.

00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:10.160
And how much data do I
have to work with here?

00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:11.870
You know, order n data.

00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:14.240
To figure out order
n squared quantities.

00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:16.490
This is the division problem
you're describing, right?

00:33:16.490 --> 00:33:19.400
So it seems like this is
an underdetermined sort

00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:20.040
of problem.

00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:20.910
And it is.

00:33:20.910 --> 00:33:21.740
OK?

00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:25.830
So there isn't a direct
analog to the Secant method

00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:27.110
in dimensions.

00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:31.090
We can write down
something that makes sense.

00:33:31.090 --> 00:33:32.990
So this is the 1D
Secant approximation.

00:33:32.990 --> 00:33:35.810
That the value of the
derivative multiplied

00:33:35.810 --> 00:33:38.750
by the step between
i minus 1 and i

00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:40.820
is approximated
by the difference

00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:43.840
in the values of the function.

00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:47.110
The equivalent is the value
of the Jacobian multiplied

00:33:47.110 --> 00:33:49.120
by the step between
i minus 1 and i

00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:51.970
is equal to the difference
between the values

00:33:51.970 --> 00:33:54.220
of the functions.

00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:57.000
But now this is
an equation for n

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:00.260
squared elements
of the Jacobian,

00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:03.700
in terms of n elements
of the function, right?

00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:07.690
So it's massively,
massively underdetermined.

00:34:07.690 --> 00:34:10.469
OK?

00:34:10.469 --> 00:34:12.120
Here we have an equation for--

00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:14.280
we have one equation
for one unknown.

00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:15.659
The derivative, right?

00:34:15.659 --> 00:34:18.420
Think about how it was moving
through space before, right?

00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:24.120
The difference here, xi minus 1,
that's some sort of linear path

00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:26.469
that I'm moving
along through space.

00:34:26.469 --> 00:34:30.420
How am I supposed to figure out
what the tangent curves to all

00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:32.556
these functions are
from this linear path

00:34:32.556 --> 00:34:34.139
through multidimensional
space, right?

00:34:34.139 --> 00:34:37.260
That's not going to work.

00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:38.840
So there's
underdetermined problems.

00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:40.920
It's not so-- that's
not so bad, actually.

00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:41.420
Right?

00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:42.719
Doesn't mean
there's no solution.

00:34:42.719 --> 00:34:44.760
In fact, it means there's
all a lot of solutions.

00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:47.630
So we can pick whichever
one we think is suitable.

00:34:47.630 --> 00:34:50.179
And Broyden's method
is a method for picking

00:34:50.179 --> 00:34:51.920
one of these
potential solutions to

00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:53.540
this underdetermined problem.

00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:56.780
We don't have enough information
to calculate the Jacobian

00:34:56.780 --> 00:34:57.710
exactly.

00:34:57.710 --> 00:35:01.380
But maybe we can construct a
suitable approximation for it.

00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:04.200
And here's what's done.

00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:06.890
So here's the Secant
approximation.

00:35:06.890 --> 00:35:08.750
It says the Jacobian
times the step

00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:10.480
size, or the
Newton-Raphson step,

00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:12.980
should be the difference
in the functions.

00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:20.660
And Newton's method for x
i, said xi minus xi minus 1

00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:22.550
was equal-- times
the Jacobian, was

00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:23.872
equal to minus f of xi minus 1.

00:35:23.872 --> 00:35:25.080
This is just Newton's method.

00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:27.710
Invert the Jacobian, and
put it on the other side

00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:28.910
of the equation.

00:35:28.910 --> 00:35:31.300
Broyden's method said,
i-- there's a trick here.

00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:33.970
Take the difference
between these things.

00:35:33.970 --> 00:35:36.660
I get the same left-hand side
on both of these equations.

00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:38.720
So take the difference,
and I can figure out

00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:41.894
how the Jacobian should change
from one step to the next.

00:35:41.894 --> 00:35:44.060
So maybe I have a good
approximation to the Jacobian

00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:48.380
at xi minus i, I might
be able to use this still

00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:51.230
underdetermined problem
to figure out how

00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:53.250
to update that Jacobian, right?

00:35:53.250 --> 00:35:56.270
So Broyden's method is what's
referred to as the rank one

00:35:56.270 --> 00:35:56.780
update.

00:35:56.780 --> 00:35:59.750
You should convince
yourself that letting

00:35:59.750 --> 00:36:04.500
the Jacobian at xi minus
the Jacobian at xi minus 1

00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:07.370
be equal to this is
one possible solution

00:36:07.370 --> 00:36:10.500
of this underdetermined
equation.

00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:12.150
There are others.

00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:13.860
This is one possible solution.

00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:17.820
It turns out to be a
good one to choose.

00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:19.500
So there's an
iterative approximation

00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:21.150
now for the Jacobian.

00:36:24.615 --> 00:36:26.745
Does this strategy make sense?

00:36:26.745 --> 00:36:27.870
It's a little weird, right?

00:36:27.870 --> 00:36:29.120
There's something tricky here.

00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:30.600
You got to know to do this.

00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:32.310
Right, so somebody
has to have in mind

00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:34.860
already that they're looking
for differences in the Jacobian

00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:36.510
that they're going
to update over time.

00:36:40.322 --> 00:36:42.780
So this tells me the Jacobian,
how the Jacobian is updated.

00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:49.480
Really we need the
Jacobian inverse,

00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:52.240
and the reason for choosing
this rank one update

00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:57.100
approximation is it's
possible to write

00:36:57.100 --> 00:37:01.330
the inverse of j of xi in
terms of the inverse of j

00:37:01.330 --> 00:37:05.100
at xi minus 1 when this
update formula is true.

00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:07.600
So it's something called the
Sherman Morrison Formula, which

00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:11.440
says the inverse of a matrix
plus the dyadic product of two

00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:14.440
vectors can be
written in this form.

00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:18.120
We don't need to derive
this, but this is true.

00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:22.260
This matrix plus dyadic
product is exactly this.

00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:24.660
We have dyadic product
between f and the step

00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:27.869
from xi minus 1 to x.

00:37:27.869 --> 00:37:29.910
And so we can apply that
Sherman Morrison Formula

00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:31.350
to the rank one update.

00:37:31.350 --> 00:37:34.656
And not only can we update
the Jacobian iteratively,

00:37:34.656 --> 00:37:36.280
but we can update
the Jacobian inverse.

00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:39.900
So if I know j inverse
at some previous time,

00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:41.899
I know j inverse at
some later time too.

00:37:41.899 --> 00:37:43.440
I don't have to
compute these things.

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:45.990
I don't have to solve these
systems of equations, right?

00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:47.220
I just update this matrix.

00:37:50.020 --> 00:37:51.880
Update this matrix,
and I can very rapidly

00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:54.639
do these computations.

00:37:54.639 --> 00:37:56.430
So not only do we have
an iterative formula

00:37:56.430 --> 00:37:57.900
for the steps, right?

00:37:57.900 --> 00:38:01.382
From x 0 to x1 to x 2,
all the way up to our

00:38:01.382 --> 00:38:02.840
converged solution,
but we can have

00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:05.460
a formula for the
inverse of the Jacobian.

00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:07.170
We give up accuracy.

00:38:07.170 --> 00:38:10.260
But that's paid for in
terms of the amount of time

00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:12.930
we have to spend doing
these calculations.

00:38:12.930 --> 00:38:13.710
Does it pay off?

00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:15.570
It depends on the
problem, right?

00:38:15.570 --> 00:38:17.890
We try to solve problems
in different ways.

00:38:17.890 --> 00:38:22.631
This is a pretty common way
to approximate the Jacobian.

00:38:22.631 --> 00:38:24.062
Questions about this?

00:38:27.410 --> 00:38:28.130
No.

00:38:28.130 --> 00:38:28.952
OK.

00:38:28.952 --> 00:38:29.660
Broyden's method.

00:38:32.619 --> 00:38:33.910
All right, here's the last one.

00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:38.190
The Damped
Newton-Raphson method.

00:38:38.190 --> 00:38:40.330
We'll do this in one dimension.

00:38:40.330 --> 00:38:42.740
So the Newton-Raphson method,
Newton and Raphson told us,

00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:46.780
take a step from xi to xi
plus 1 that is this big.

00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:53.570
xi to xi plus 1, it's this big.

00:38:53.570 --> 00:38:56.270
Sometimes you'll take
that step, and you'll

00:38:56.270 --> 00:38:59.360
find that the value of
the function at xi plus 1

00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:02.180
is even bigger than the
value of the function at xi.

00:39:02.180 --> 00:39:04.429
There was nothing about the
Newton-Raphson method that

00:39:04.429 --> 00:39:07.149
told us the function value was
always going to be decreasing.

00:39:07.149 --> 00:39:09.440
But actually, our goal is to
make the function value go

00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:11.070
to 0 in absolute value.

00:39:11.070 --> 00:39:16.370
So it seems like this step,
not a very good one, right?

00:39:16.370 --> 00:39:18.120
What are Newton and
Raphson thinking here.

00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:19.440
This is not a good idea.

00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:20.630
The function value went up.

00:39:24.830 --> 00:39:25.994
Far from a root, OK?

00:39:25.994 --> 00:39:27.410
The Newton-Raphson
method is going

00:39:27.410 --> 00:39:29.621
to give these sorts
of erratic responses.

00:39:29.621 --> 00:39:31.370
Who knows what direction
it's going to go?

00:39:31.370 --> 00:39:35.480
And it's only
locally convergent.

00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:37.191
It tells us a
direction to move in,

00:39:37.191 --> 00:39:39.440
but it doesn't always give
the right sort of magnitude

00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:41.310
associated with that step.

00:39:41.310 --> 00:39:43.310
And so you take these
steps and you can find out

00:39:43.310 --> 00:39:45.650
the value of your function, the
normed value of your functions.

00:39:45.650 --> 00:39:47.108
It's bigger than
where you started.

00:39:47.108 --> 00:39:49.670
It seems like you're getting
further away from the root.

00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:52.880
Our ultimate goal is to
drive this norm to 0.

00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:55.310
So steps like that you might
even call unacceptable.

00:39:55.310 --> 00:39:55.520
Right?

00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:57.270
Why would I ever take a
step in that direction?

00:39:57.270 --> 00:39:58.940
Maybe I should use
a different method.

00:39:58.940 --> 00:40:01.550
When I take a step that's
so big my function value

00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:03.020
grows in norm value.

00:40:05.690 --> 00:40:08.920
So what one does, oftentimes,
is introduce a damping factor,

00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:09.970
right?

00:40:09.970 --> 00:40:13.450
We said that this
ratio, or equivalently,

00:40:13.450 --> 00:40:15.760
the Jacobian inverse times
the value of the function,

00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:18.320
gives us the right
direction to step in.

00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:21.760
But how big a step
should we take?

00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:25.750
It's clear a step like
this is a good one.

00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:27.320
It reduced the value
of the function.

00:40:30.647 --> 00:40:32.480
And it's better than
the one we took before,

00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:35.240
which was given by the
linear approximation.

00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:38.150
So if I draw the tangent
line, it intercepts here.

00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:40.290
If I take a step
in this direction,

00:40:40.290 --> 00:40:42.440
but I reduce the
slope by having some

00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:43.990
damping factor that's
smaller than 1,

00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:46.570
I get closer to the root.

00:40:46.570 --> 00:40:50.710
Ideally we'd like to
choose that damping factor

00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:54.760
to be the one that minimizes
the value of the function at xi

00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:57.280
plus 1.

00:40:57.280 --> 00:41:01.510
So it's the argument
that minimizes

00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:05.530
the value of the function at xi
plus 1 or at xi minus alpha, f

00:41:05.530 --> 00:41:08.060
over f prime.

00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:09.500
Solving that
optimization problem,

00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:12.150
what's hard as finding
the root itself.

00:41:12.150 --> 00:41:13.760
So ideally this is true.

00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:16.730
But practically you're not
going to be able to do it.

00:41:16.730 --> 00:41:20.540
So we have to come up with some
approximate methods of solving

00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:21.624
this optimization problem.

00:41:21.624 --> 00:41:23.748
Actually we don't even care
about getting it exact.

00:41:23.748 --> 00:41:25.670
We know Newton-Raphson
does a pretty good job.

00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:28.400
We want some sort
of guess that's

00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:32.216
respectable for this alpha so
that we get close to this root.

00:41:32.216 --> 00:41:33.590
Once we get close,
we'll probably

00:41:33.590 --> 00:41:34.774
choose alpha equal to 1.

00:41:34.774 --> 00:41:36.440
We'll just take the
Newton-Raphson steps

00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:40.100
all the way down to the root.

00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:41.800
So here it is in
many dimensions.

00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:45.960
Modify the Newton-Raphson
step by some value alpha,

00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:47.890
choose alpha to be
the argument that

00:41:47.890 --> 00:41:52.270
minimizes the norm value of
the function at xi plus 1.

00:41:55.510 --> 00:41:57.340
Here's one way of doing this.

00:41:57.340 --> 00:41:59.330
So this is called the
Armijo line search.

00:41:59.330 --> 00:41:59.830
See?

00:41:59.830 --> 00:42:01.180
Line search.

00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:03.400
Start by letting
alpha equal to 1.

00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:05.960
Take the full Newton-Raphson
step, and check.

00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:09.000
Was the value of my function
smaller than where I started?

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.470
If it is, let's take the step.

00:42:11.470 --> 00:42:13.630
It's getting us-- we're
accomplishing our goal.

00:42:13.630 --> 00:42:16.180
We re reducing the value
of the function in norm.

00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:17.410
Maybe we're headed towards z.

00:42:17.410 --> 00:42:18.370
That's good.

00:42:18.370 --> 00:42:20.020
Accept it.

00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:24.440
If no, let's replace
alpha with alpha over 2.

00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:25.630
Let's take a shorter step.

00:42:28.330 --> 00:42:30.190
We take a shorter
step, and we repeat.

00:42:30.190 --> 00:42:30.690
Right?

00:42:30.690 --> 00:42:32.029
Take the shorter step.

00:42:32.029 --> 00:42:34.570
Check whether the value of the
function with the shorter step

00:42:34.570 --> 00:42:35.740
is acceptable.

00:42:35.740 --> 00:42:38.540
If yes, let's take
it, and let's move on.

00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:42.590
And if no, replace alpha with
alpha over 2, and continue.

00:42:42.590 --> 00:42:45.580
So we have our step
size every time.

00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:47.080
We don't just have to have it.

00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:49.930
We could choose different
factors to reduce it by.

00:42:49.930 --> 00:42:52.300
But we try to take
shorter and shorter steps

00:42:52.300 --> 00:42:56.710
until we accomplish our goal
of having a function which

00:42:56.710 --> 00:42:58.900
is smaller in norm
at our next iterate

00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:01.580
than where we were before.

00:43:01.580 --> 00:43:03.910
It's got-- the function
value will be reduced.

00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:06.430
The Newton-Raphson
method picks a direction

00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:10.170
that wants to bring the
function value closer to 0.

00:43:10.170 --> 00:43:11.797
We linearize the
function, and we

00:43:11.797 --> 00:43:14.380
found the direction we needed
to go to make that linearization

00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:14.880
go to 0.

00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:18.310
So there is a step size
for which the function

00:43:18.310 --> 00:43:21.450
value will be reduced.

00:43:21.450 --> 00:43:23.632
And because of that,
this Armijo line search

00:43:23.632 --> 00:43:25.090
of the Damped
Newton-Raphson method

00:43:25.090 --> 00:43:27.690
is actually globally
convergent, right?

00:43:27.690 --> 00:43:30.370
The iterative method
will terminate.

00:43:30.370 --> 00:43:31.347
You can guarantee it.

00:43:31.347 --> 00:43:32.930
Here's what it looks
like graphically.

00:43:32.930 --> 00:43:35.790
I take my big step, my
alpha equals 1 step.

00:43:35.790 --> 00:43:37.375
I check the value
of the function.

00:43:37.375 --> 00:43:39.500
It's bigger in absolute
value than where I started.

00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:40.570
So I go back.

00:43:40.570 --> 00:43:42.830
I take half that step size.

00:43:42.830 --> 00:43:43.570
OK?

00:43:43.570 --> 00:43:44.480
I look at the value
of the function.

00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:45.280
It's still bigger.

00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:46.890
Let's reject it, and go back.

00:43:46.890 --> 00:43:48.719
I take half that
step size again.

00:43:48.719 --> 00:43:50.260
The value of the
function here is now

00:43:50.260 --> 00:43:51.950
smaller in absolute value.

00:43:51.950 --> 00:43:53.370
So I accept it.

00:43:53.370 --> 00:43:57.200
And I put myself pretty
close to the root.

00:43:57.200 --> 00:44:00.050
So it's convergent,
globally convergent.

00:44:00.050 --> 00:44:01.850
That's nice.

00:44:01.850 --> 00:44:05.712
It's not globally convergent
to roots, which is a pain.

00:44:05.712 --> 00:44:06.920
But it's globally convergent.

00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:08.220
It will terminate eventually.

00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:11.780
You'll get to a
point where you won't

00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:14.500
be able to advance
your steps any further.

00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:18.050
It may converge to minima
or maxima of a function.

00:44:18.050 --> 00:44:19.486
Or it may converge to roots.

00:44:19.486 --> 00:44:20.360
But it will converge.

00:44:23.290 --> 00:44:26.732
I showed you this example before
with basins of attraction.

00:44:26.732 --> 00:44:28.690
So here we have different
basins of attraction.

00:44:28.690 --> 00:44:29.648
They're all colored in.

00:44:29.648 --> 00:44:31.460
They show you which
roots you approach.

00:44:31.460 --> 00:44:34.680
Here I've applied the
Damped Newton-Raphson method

00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:36.714
to the same system of equations.

00:44:36.714 --> 00:44:38.380
And you can see the
basins of attraction

00:44:38.380 --> 00:44:41.380
are shrunk because
of the damping.

00:44:41.380 --> 00:44:44.380
What happens when you're
very close to places where

00:44:44.380 --> 00:44:46.640
the determinant of the
Jacobian is singular,

00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:49.690
you take all sorts
of wild steps.

00:44:49.690 --> 00:44:51.700
You go to places where
the value of the function

00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:54.019
is bigger than
where you started.

00:44:54.019 --> 00:44:55.810
And then you've got to
step down from there

00:44:55.810 --> 00:44:57.430
to try to find the root.

00:44:57.430 --> 00:44:59.320
Who knows where
those locations are?

00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:02.650
It's a very complicated,
geometrically complicated space

00:45:02.650 --> 00:45:04.075
that you're moving through.

00:45:04.075 --> 00:45:05.575
And the Damped
Newton-Raphson method

00:45:05.575 --> 00:45:09.784
is forcing the steps
to always reduce

00:45:09.784 --> 00:45:11.200
the value of the
function, so they

00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:15.030
reduce the size of these
basins of attraction.

00:45:15.030 --> 00:45:18.437
So this is often a
nice way to supplement

00:45:18.437 --> 00:45:20.520
the Newton-Raphson method
when your guesses aren't

00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:21.589
very good to begin with.

00:45:21.589 --> 00:45:23.880
When you start to get close
to root you're, always just

00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:25.650
going to accept alpha equals 1.

00:45:25.650 --> 00:45:27.480
The first step will
be the best step,

00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:30.825
and then you'll converge
very rapidly to the solution.

00:45:30.825 --> 00:45:33.150
Do we have to do any
extra work actually

00:45:33.150 --> 00:45:35.460
to do this Damped
Newton-Raphson method.

00:45:35.460 --> 00:45:37.310
Does it require
extra calculations?

00:45:43.010 --> 00:45:44.057
What do you think?

00:45:44.057 --> 00:45:45.890
A lot of extra-- a lot
of extra calculation?

00:45:45.890 --> 00:45:47.780
How many extra calculations
does it require?

00:45:47.780 --> 00:45:48.990
Of course it requires extra.

00:45:48.990 --> 00:45:50.246
How many?

00:45:50.246 --> 00:45:55.076
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:55.076 --> 00:45:56.712
JAMES SWAN: What do you think?

00:45:56.712 --> 00:46:07.180
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:07.180 --> 00:46:09.060
JAMES SWAN: It's--
that much is true.

00:46:09.060 --> 00:46:13.160
So let's talk about
taking one step.

00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:15.860
How many more-- how many
more calculations do

00:46:15.860 --> 00:46:18.110
I have to pay to do
this sort of a step?

00:46:18.110 --> 00:46:21.490
Or even write the
multidimensional step?

00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:27.185
For each of these
times around this loop,

00:46:27.185 --> 00:46:28.810
do I have to recompute?

00:46:28.810 --> 00:46:32.420
Do I have to solve the
system of equations?

00:46:32.420 --> 00:46:32.930
No.

00:46:32.930 --> 00:46:33.430
Right?

00:46:33.430 --> 00:46:34.970
You precompute this, right?

00:46:34.970 --> 00:46:36.560
This is the basic
Newton-Raphson step.

00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:37.518
You compute that first.

00:46:37.518 --> 00:46:39.470
You've got to do it once.

00:46:39.470 --> 00:46:41.472
And then it's pretty
cheap after that.

00:46:41.472 --> 00:46:43.430
I've got to do some extra
function evaluations,

00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:45.888
but I don't actually have to
solve the system of equations.

00:46:45.888 --> 00:46:49.040
Remember this is order n cubed.

00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:53.690
If we solve it exactly, maybe
order n squared or order

00:46:53.690 --> 00:46:55.160
n if we do it iteratively.

00:46:55.160 --> 00:46:57.620
And the Jacobian
is sparse somehow,

00:46:57.620 --> 00:46:59.510
and we know about
it sparsity pattern.

00:46:59.510 --> 00:47:00.320
This is expensive.

00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:04.040
Function evaluations, those
are order n to compute.

00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:05.490
Relatively cheap by comparison.

00:47:05.490 --> 00:47:08.760
So you compute
your initial step.

00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:09.690
That's expensive.

00:47:09.690 --> 00:47:13.500
But all of this down
here is pretty cheap.

00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:14.211
Yeah?

00:47:14.211 --> 00:47:15.894
AUDIENCE: You're also assuming
that your function evaluations

00:47:15.894 --> 00:47:16.620
are reasonably true.

00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:17.661
JAMES SWAN: This is true.

00:47:17.661 --> 00:47:19.474
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:19.474 --> 00:47:20.390
JAMES SWAN: It's true.

00:47:20.390 --> 00:47:23.250
Well, Jacobian is also very
expensive to compute then too.

00:47:23.250 --> 00:47:24.830
So, if--

00:47:24.830 --> 00:47:28.352
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:28.352 --> 00:47:29.560
JAMES SWAN: Sure, sure, sure.

00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:31.210
No, I don't disagree.

00:47:31.210 --> 00:47:33.550
I think one has to pick
the method you're going

00:47:33.550 --> 00:47:35.380
to use to suit the problem.

00:47:35.380 --> 00:47:37.900
But turns out this doesn't
involve much extra calculation.

00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:40.060
So by default, for
example, fsolve in MATLAB

00:47:40.060 --> 00:47:41.560
is going to do this for you.

00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:43.450
Or some version of this.

00:47:43.450 --> 00:47:46.150
it's going to try to take
steps that aren't too big.

00:47:46.150 --> 00:47:47.740
It will limit the
step size for you,

00:47:47.740 --> 00:47:50.830
so that it keeps the value
of the function reducing

00:47:50.830 --> 00:47:52.320
in magnitude.

00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:55.160
It's a pretty good
general strategy.

00:47:55.160 --> 00:47:55.998
Yes?

00:47:55.998 --> 00:48:03.468
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] so why
do we just pick one value for

00:48:03.468 --> 00:48:08.500
[INAUDIBLE]

00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:09.250
JAMES SWAN: I see.

00:48:09.250 --> 00:48:11.160
So why-- ask that one more time.

00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:12.244
This is a good question.

00:48:12.244 --> 00:48:14.410
Can you say it a little
louder so everyone can hear?

00:48:14.410 --> 00:48:17.791
AUDIENCE: So why, instead of
having just one value of alpha

00:48:17.791 --> 00:48:21.700
and not having several
values of alpha [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:22.450
JAMES SWAN: I see.

00:48:22.450 --> 00:48:26.740
So the question is, yeah,
we used a scalar alpha here,

00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:27.550
right?

00:48:27.550 --> 00:48:30.130
If we wanted to, we could
reduce the step size

00:48:30.130 --> 00:48:32.260
and also change direction.

00:48:32.260 --> 00:48:34.960
We would use a matrix to
do that, instead, right?

00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:37.180
It would transform the step
and change its direction.

00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:39.184
And maybe we would
choose different alphas

00:48:39.184 --> 00:48:40.850
along different
directions, for example.

00:48:40.850 --> 00:48:43.300
So diagonal matrix
with different alphas.

00:48:43.300 --> 00:48:46.150
We could potentially do that.

00:48:46.150 --> 00:48:50.650
we're probably going to
need some extra information

00:48:50.650 --> 00:48:55.400
to decide how to set the
scaling in different directions.

00:48:55.400 --> 00:48:59.770
One thing we know for sure is
that the Newton-Raphson step

00:48:59.770 --> 00:49:01.550
will reduce the value
of the function.

00:49:01.550 --> 00:49:03.490
If we take a small
enough step size,

00:49:03.490 --> 00:49:05.890
it will bring the value
of the function down.

00:49:05.890 --> 00:49:07.870
We know that because
we did the Taylor

00:49:07.870 --> 00:49:11.710
Expansion of the function
to determine that step size.

00:49:11.710 --> 00:49:13.950
And that Taylor expansion
was going to be--

00:49:13.950 --> 00:49:17.170
that Taylor expansion is
nearly exact in the limit

00:49:17.170 --> 00:49:18.820
of very, very small step sizes.

00:49:18.820 --> 00:49:21.220
So there will always
be some small step

00:49:21.220 --> 00:49:24.570
in this direction,
which will reduce

00:49:24.570 --> 00:49:25.720
the value of the function.

00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:27.840
In other directions,
we may reduce the value

00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:30.090
of the function faster.

00:49:30.090 --> 00:49:32.560
We don't know which
directions to choose, OK?

00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:33.810
Actually I shouldn't say that.

00:49:33.810 --> 00:49:35.610
When we take very small step
sizes in this direction,

00:49:35.610 --> 00:49:37.609
it's reducing the value
of the function fastest.

00:49:37.609 --> 00:49:39.480
There isn't a faster
direction to go in.

00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:44.459
When we take impossibly small,
vanishingly small step sizes.

00:49:44.459 --> 00:49:46.500
But in principle, if I
had some extra information

00:49:46.500 --> 00:49:48.480
on the problem, I might be
able to choose step sizes

00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:49.605
along different directions.

00:49:49.605 --> 00:49:51.600
I may know that one
of these directions

00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:55.080
is more ill-behaved
than the other ones.

00:49:55.080 --> 00:49:57.416
And choose a different
damping factor for it.

00:49:57.416 --> 00:49:58.290
That's a possibility.

00:49:58.290 --> 00:50:00.030
But we actually have
to know something

00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:01.320
about the details of
the problem we're trying

00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:02.611
to solve if we're going to do--

00:50:02.611 --> 00:50:03.820
it's a wonderful question.

00:50:03.820 --> 00:50:05.880
I mean, you could
think about ways

00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:08.016
of making this more,
potentially more robust.

00:50:08.016 --> 00:50:10.140
I'll show you an alternative
way of doing this when

00:50:10.140 --> 00:50:12.660
we talk about optimization.

00:50:12.660 --> 00:50:14.280
In optimization we'll
do-- we'll solve

00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:16.890
systems of nonlinear equations
to solve these optimization

00:50:16.890 --> 00:50:17.550
problems.

00:50:17.550 --> 00:50:20.454
There's another way of doing
the same sort of strategy that's

00:50:20.454 --> 00:50:21.870
more along what
you're describing.

00:50:21.870 --> 00:50:23.328
Maybe there's a
different direction

00:50:23.328 --> 00:50:25.130
to choose instead that
could be preferable.

00:50:25.130 --> 00:50:27.640
This is something called
the dogleg method.

00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:30.230
Great question.

00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:32.260
Anything else?

00:50:32.260 --> 00:50:32.760
No.

00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:39.720
So globally convergent, right?

00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:42.821
Converges to roots,
local minima or maxima.

00:50:42.821 --> 00:50:44.820
There are other modifications
that are possible.

00:50:44.820 --> 00:50:46.645
We'll talk about
them in optimization.

00:50:46.645 --> 00:50:48.270
There's always a
penalty to doing this.

00:50:48.270 --> 00:50:50.550
The penalty is in the
rate of convergence.

00:50:50.550 --> 00:50:51.910
So it will converge more slowly.

00:50:51.910 --> 00:50:53.790
But maybe you speed the
calculations along anyways,

00:50:53.790 --> 00:50:54.289
right?

00:50:54.289 --> 00:50:56.370
Maybe it requires fewer
iterations overall

00:50:56.370 --> 00:50:59.135
to get there because
you tame the locally

00:50:59.135 --> 00:51:01.260
convergent properties of
the Newton-Raphson method.

00:51:01.260 --> 00:51:05.160
Or you shortcut some of
the expensive calculations,

00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:07.740
like getting your Jacobian
or calculating your Jacobian

00:51:07.740 --> 00:51:09.010
inverse.

00:51:09.010 --> 00:51:10.280
All right?

00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:13.050
So Monday we're going to review
sort of topics up til now.

00:51:13.050 --> 00:51:15.234
Professor Green will run
the lecture on Monday.

00:51:15.234 --> 00:51:16.650
And then after
that, we'll pick up

00:51:16.650 --> 00:51:18.900
with optimization, which will
follow right on from what

00:51:18.900 --> 00:51:19.680
we've done so far.

00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:21.230
Thanks.
