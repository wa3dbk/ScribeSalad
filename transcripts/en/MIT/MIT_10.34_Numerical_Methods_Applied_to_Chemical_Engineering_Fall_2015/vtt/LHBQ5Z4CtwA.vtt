00:00:24.488 --> 00:00:27.604
PROFESSOR: You get your
quizzes back on Monday.

00:00:27.604 --> 00:00:29.520
Maybe you've had some
time to think about them

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.710
and reflect on your
answers and the problems

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.950
that were posed, maybe how they
compared to the quiz that--

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.283
sample quiz that was put online.

00:00:36.283 --> 00:00:38.850
I think it was pretty
fair exam overall.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.740
It looked very similar,
actually, to the exam

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.280
that we've given in the
past, but we tried to--

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.860
tried not to put any sort of
chemical engineering problems

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.720
on top of the
numerics, which tends

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.160
to lead to confusion basically.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.830
Spent a lot of time
reading and trying

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.470
to understand what the
underlying physical problem is

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:00.450
instead of just testing
the numerical methods.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.050
Are there any questions
about the quiz

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:02.940
now that you've gotten it back?

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.920
You've seen your answers,
things that were unclear that

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:05.753
were asked on there?

00:01:05.753 --> 00:01:10.780
Now is a good time for
reflection if there are.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.200
No.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.090
I heard this last homework
assignment was really long, so

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.800
sorry about that.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:17.800
I didn't write this one.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.285
[LAUGHS]

00:01:19.285 --> 00:01:21.730
I'm not going to
Take credit for it.

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:25.885
It's hard to judge sometimes
how long these things take.

00:01:25.885 --> 00:01:30.280
A lot of it has to do with how
facile you are with coding up

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.192
some of the problems.

00:01:31.192 --> 00:01:32.650
So conceptually
they can be simple,

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.233
but the coding can
be quite difficult,

00:01:34.233 --> 00:01:35.590
so it's hard to estimate.

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.080
I think this week's,
which should be posted

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.020
and is on the topic of
DAE, should be easier.

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.380
It's only got two
problems instead of three.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.130
You're likely going
to be able to leverage

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:46.780
some of the code
from your solution

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.160
last week for this week.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.210
So I don't think it should
be quite so challenging.

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.530
There is a last part
to the first problem

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.020
that seems to always
give first-year graduate

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.130
students trouble.

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.470
Somehow you guys don't
know how to write down

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.050
energy balances on reactors.

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.270
So you might ask
pointed questions

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.210
about this at your office hours,
so you don't spend time trying

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.200
to solve the wrong equations.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.780
This happens.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.060
I think many of you maybe were
taught incorrectly or just

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.690
forgot at some point how
to write these things down.

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.711
So the office hour is a
good point to bring that up,

00:02:25.711 --> 00:02:27.460
and that way you don't
spend a lot of time

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:32.170
troubling yourself with the
wrong system of equations.

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.051
Any questions?

00:02:34.051 --> 00:02:34.550
Yes.

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.542
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:39.542 --> 00:02:40.500
PROFESSOR: What's that?

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.980
I'd-- well, to be fair, almost
all the lectures for the rest

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.350
of the class are going to be
taught by Professor Green.

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.940
I'll step in and do some
review for two sessions,

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.710
review before the second quiz
and review before the final.

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:55.480
Since he's leading
the lectures, he'll

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.200
be responsible for largely
generating the homework

00:02:59.200 --> 00:02:59.920
assignments.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.760
I'll try to help out
with that as best I can,

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.420
but this will be the
last formal lecture

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.210
you get from me this term.

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:11.520
Other questions?

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.720
Well, that's very,
very sweet of you.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.040
Thank you so much.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.670
Least there wasn't
any hushed yes!

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.765
Today's lecture is
our last one on DAE,

00:03:23.765 --> 00:03:26.512
so we're only going to do two.

00:03:26.512 --> 00:03:28.720
You're going to see today
that differential algebraic

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.960
equations are pretty
complicated actually.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.870
And when they get
sufficiently complicated,

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.850
you really need to reach
out to existing codes that

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.790
are designed to solve particular
classes of differential

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:43.840
algebraic equations.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.270
So for you, it's
more important to be

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:49.600
able to identify in the
models you formulate when

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.420
these complications
arise and what

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.880
are the essential
ingredients of the model that

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.680
can be put into one
of these solvers

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.124
that you get a result
that isn't nonsense.

00:03:59.124 --> 00:04:00.790
And that's what we're
going to do today.

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.510
There's going to be lots of
examples to work through.

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.180
So make sure you're
sitting next to somebody

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.800
you like because I'm
going to ask you to try

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.570
to think about these
things and discuss things

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:08.380
as we go through.

00:04:10.857 --> 00:04:12.940
Let me review where these
complications come from.

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.070
So last time we talked
briefly about semi-explicit

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:18.256
and fully-implicit differential
algebraic equations.

00:04:18.256 --> 00:04:20.589
I told you in principle, you
could simulate these things

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:22.620
with backwards
difference formulas

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.327
in solving nonlinear
equations at each time step

00:04:25.327 --> 00:04:26.410
and just marching forward.

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.320
Did this in your
homework for ODE IVP

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.950
So you can do the same thing
for differential algebraic

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:33.670
equations.

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:37.210
But there was a catch to
that, and I illustrated that

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:38.020
at the very end.

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.980
So maybe your brain was fried
at the end, and you missed this.

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.740
It's good to recap.

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.070
So I showed you an
example of a stirred tank

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:47.260
where you had some--

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.410
you had transport of some
solute into the stirred tank,

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:52.970
and then you're pulling it out
at a different concentration.

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:55.970
And we're trying to track
the dynamics of the system,

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.114
the concentration in and
the concentration out,

00:04:58.114 --> 00:04:59.530
and we imagined a
problem in which

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.630
we measured and the
concentration in

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.390
and we tried to predict
the concentration out.

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:08.590
So we had a system of
differential and algebraic

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.540
equations to solve.

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.600
And I showed you that if I
used the backward Euler method,

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.710
the lowest order backwards
difference formula that I can--

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.730
of the canonical
class of these things

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:22.330
that I can craft, where I
approximate the derivative

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:27.250
of an unknown with a relative
error or an error proportional

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:31.502
to the time step delta t,
that carrying out one time

00:05:31.502 --> 00:05:33.460
step with this backward
differentiation formula

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.990
would determine c1 in
principle exactly--

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.765
if I knew gamma exactly,
I would know c1 exactly.

00:05:38.765 --> 00:05:42.610
And it would determine c2 to
within order delta t-squared.

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:46.160
It's the local truncation error
here was order delta t-squared.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.190
So you just substitute
this formula in,

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:50.860
and you ask does this
error term change at all.

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:52.900
At some point, I wind up
multiplying by delta t,

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:56.240
and so I go from order delta t
to order delta t-squared It's

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.240
the numerical error
that gets carried around

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.790
in this calculation.

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:04.180
I just switch the
model a little bit.

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:07.140
It seems like a
irrelevant change,

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:09.210
but it turns out to be
incredibly significant.

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:11.520
So now I imagine a
different problem

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.490
in which I'm measuring
c2 the outlet,

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:19.740
and I want to
predict c1 the inlet.

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:22.290
I still have a system of
DAEs that I have to solve,

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:24.690
and if I applied the
backwards Euler method,

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:26.820
well, c2 is
automatically determined

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:28.350
by this algebraic equation.

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:30.060
So I know that exactly.

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:33.420
I got to go up to this first
equation and solve it for c1,

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:36.630
and when I do, I have
to have an approximation

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:37.500
for the derivative.

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:40.576
And the derivative is
proportional to delta t--

00:06:40.576 --> 00:06:43.200
carries an error around with it
that's proportional to delta t.

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:47.879
So I know c1 to within order
delta t, not order delta

00:06:47.879 --> 00:06:49.420
t-squared like in
the previous model.

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:51.300
So there's something
fundamentally different

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.130
about these two circumstances.

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:57.550
And all I did was go from c1 to
c2 in this algebraic equation.

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:59.506
So that's peculiar,
and that should

00:06:59.506 --> 00:07:01.380
make you really suspicious
about your ability

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:04.260
to solve these
problems accurately.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.010
And here was the third
example I gave you.

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:12.010
So I said imagine this
system of DAEs instead.

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:13.750
So here's the
differential equation.

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:15.250
Here's an algebraic equation.

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:17.340
Apply the backward Euler method.

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:19.630
Well, c3 is determined
automatically

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:21.220
by this algebraic equation.

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:22.680
I know it exactly.

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:25.370
C2 is related to the
derivative of c3,

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:28.270
so I need to approximate it with
my backward Euler derivative.

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:31.222
And that picks up an
error, order delta t.

00:07:31.222 --> 00:07:35.110
C1 is equal to the
derivative of c2,

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:37.270
so I need an
approximation for c2.

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:40.480
The derivative of c2 that's the
backwards Euler approximation.

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:44.070
That has an error that's
proportional to order delta t.

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:49.270
But c2 itself also has an error
proportional to order delta t.

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:53.110
And order delta t divided
by delta t is order 1.

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:54.250
So I get c3.

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:55.660
I get c2.

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:57.760
I even know what c1 is.

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:00.280
I solve this problem with my
backwards difference formula,

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:06.230
and I have no resolution of
c1, no clue what that value is.

00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:08.410
So this is some
complicated control scheme

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:11.260
that I've set up, and I
need to know the value of c1

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.210
to figure out how to
operate this process.

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:14.590
I'm lost.

00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:16.780
This is never going to work.

00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:19.330
So these three problems
have fundamental differences

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:20.560
between them.

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:23.170
And I'm going to show
you how to predict

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:27.746
when these differences are going
to occur, how to name them.

00:08:27.746 --> 00:08:30.180
So the stirred
tank example 1, it

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:33.110
carried a local truncation
error, one time step order

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:34.387
delta-t squared.

00:08:34.387 --> 00:08:36.720
Stirred tank example 2 carried
a local truncation error.

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:38.610
It's order delta-t.

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:41.010
This third DAE example had
a local truncation error

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:41.730
that's order 1.

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:45.030
No change in delta-t
will improve my solution

00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:46.710
to that problem.

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:50.570
It's independent of how I choose
to do my time setting, which,

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:54.757
of course, is ridiculous.

00:08:54.757 --> 00:08:55.840
So here's another problem.

00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:02.942
And I'd like you
to try to do this.

00:09:02.942 --> 00:09:04.650
We'll see how far you
can get through it.

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:05.820
You don't have to get
all the way through it,

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:07.861
but see how far you can
get through this problem.

00:09:07.861 --> 00:09:10.280
So can you apply the
backward Euler method

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:14.634
to this system of DAEs
and try to predict how

00:09:14.634 --> 00:09:15.425
the air propagates.

00:09:15.425 --> 00:09:18.834
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:17.410
OK, I don't want to break up
the conversation too much,

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:21.020
but tell me what you're
finding as you try to do this.

00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:21.520
Yes.

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:23.795
AUDIENCE: We found
that c3 has to be 0.

00:12:23.795 --> 00:12:25.510
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:27.610
How did you find
that c3 has to be 0?

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:29.466
AUDIENCE: Stick in
this [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:29.466 --> 00:12:31.466
that's what the difference
is of the [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:31.466 --> 00:12:32.250
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:34.400
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:35.130
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:35.910
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:36.618
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:12:36.618 --> 00:12:38.536
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:38.536 --> 00:12:40.655
PROFESSOR: OK, so
this is very clever,

00:12:40.655 --> 00:12:45.500
and this has to do with how
the model itself is formulated.

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:49.040
So you did manipulations with
the fundamental equations

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:54.470
that I wrote down to
determine that c3 had to be 0.

00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:55.465
That's good.

00:12:55.465 --> 00:12:56.090
We can do that.

00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:56.765
We can look at the equations.

00:12:56.765 --> 00:12:59.060
We can figure how to eliminate
variables and find out--

00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:01.604
c3 in this case
always has to be 0.

00:13:01.604 --> 00:13:03.770
That may or may not be
obvious, but one way to do it

00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:07.264
is take this constraint equation
and take its derivative.

00:13:07.264 --> 00:13:08.930
This has to hold at
every point in time,

00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:11.520
so its derivative must hold
at every point in time.

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:13.220
Substitute these
other two equations

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:18.080
in, c1 dot plus c2 dot
eliminates c1 and c2,

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:20.090
and all that will be
left is c3 has to be 0.

00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:21.950
So if I manipulate
these equations,

00:13:21.950 --> 00:13:24.369
I know c3 has to be 0.

00:13:24.369 --> 00:13:26.660
Let's suppose I don't manipulate
the equations, though.

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:30.080
Let's suppose I just put in the
backward Euler approximation

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:31.640
over here for the
derivative, and I

00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:35.930
evaluate c1, c2 and
c3 at the current time

00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:39.890
and ask what is c1, c2, and c3
at the current time in terms

00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:41.369
of what it was at
the previous time

00:13:41.369 --> 00:13:43.160
And you get an answer
that looks like this.

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:44.930
So there's a simple
system of equations

00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:45.960
that one has to solve.

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:48.500
It's a three-by-three system,
and it's easy to eliminate.

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:49.910
I didn't really expect you--

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:51.230
actually expected
this answer to come up

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:52.771
because you guys
are all very clever,

00:13:52.771 --> 00:13:54.770
so you try to make
things easy beforehand.

00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:56.900
But it's-- there's
a problem here.

00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:59.030
If I try to just do the
backwards difference

00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:03.670
formula with the equations
as they're written,

00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:05.420
I'll find out that
when I solve this thing

00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:10.390
that c1 will be c1 minus c2 at
the previous time step over 2

00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:12.990
plus an order delta
t-squared error.

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:15.950
C2 will take on the opposite
sign plus an order delta

00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:18.590
t-squared error.

00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:25.280
C3 will be minus c1
plus c2 over 2 delta t

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:28.580
plus an order delta t error.

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:32.900
And actually if I were to apply
successive approximations,

00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:34.820
different-- if I step--

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:37.310
take many steps in a row with
this backward Euler method,

00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:39.601
there's nothing to guarantee
that these constraints are

00:14:39.601 --> 00:14:42.260
satisfied exactly.

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.330
I can have numerical
error in my solution

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:46.700
of this algebraic equation.

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:49.340
So it isn't necessarily true
that in my numerical solution

00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:52.400
c1 plus c2 is equal to 0.

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:54.312
I can show you right
here if I add c1 to c2.

00:14:54.312 --> 00:14:55.520
Well, these two are the same.

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:58.370
They'll cancel, but am I
guaranteed that these errors

00:14:58.370 --> 00:14:59.120
will cancel, too?

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:00.786
Or will there be a
small numerical error

00:15:00.786 --> 00:15:03.490
that propagates?

00:15:03.490 --> 00:15:06.170
So model formulation is key.

00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:09.530
This problem is like
stirred tank problem 2.

00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:12.650
One of our solutions
lost in order of accuracy

00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:14.279
in the local truncation error.

00:15:14.279 --> 00:15:15.320
It's not delta t-squared.

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:18.160
It's order delta t.

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:21.170
And what you want it to do,
which is not necessarily

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:23.840
a bad thing, was to try
to use this constraint

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:27.801
to somehow eliminate
equations and simplify things.

00:15:27.801 --> 00:15:29.300
That can be helpful,
but it can also

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:31.460
be true that if I use this
constraint to simplify

00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:34.580
equations and eliminate
things, my numerical solutions

00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:36.860
may no longer satisfy
the constraint at all.

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:41.554
They may drift away from
that algebraic equation.

00:15:41.554 --> 00:15:42.470
Does that makes sense?

00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:44.928
I'm not controlling the error
with respect to that equation

00:15:44.928 --> 00:15:45.587
anymore.

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:55.810
So how do you give a name
to this kind of behavior?

00:15:55.810 --> 00:16:00.340
And the thing one talks about
is the differential index

00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:02.017
of a DAE system.

00:16:02.017 --> 00:16:03.850
So let's look at the
stirred tank example 1,

00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:06.550
and let's ask this question.

00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:09.400
How many time
derivatives are needed

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:12.910
to convert to a system of
independent ODEs having

00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:14.770
differentials of
all the unknowns.

00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:16.960
So there are two
unknowns in this system.

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:19.570
One is c1, and the other c2.

00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:20.980
Actually have one
equation, which

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:23.820
contains a differential of c2.

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:25.960
How many derivatives of
these equations with time

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:31.660
do I need to take in order to
get an equivalent ODE system?

00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:32.700
And it's just one.

00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:35.250
If I take the derivative
of equation 2,

00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:37.140
I'll get a differential
equation for c1.

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:39.510
Now, I have a differential
equation for c1

00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:42.540
and a differential
equation for c2.

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:44.280
DAEs of this type,
where I only have

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:47.790
to take the time derivative once
of the algebraic constraints,

00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:51.664
are called index 1 DAEs.

00:16:51.664 --> 00:16:53.830
We saw that when we applied
the backwards difference

00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:56.097
formula to stirred
tank example 1,

00:16:56.097 --> 00:16:58.180
the local truncation error
was the same as what we

00:16:58.180 --> 00:17:01.070
would get in an ODE IVP system.

00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:02.320
So index 1--

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:04.720
DAEs are easy to solve.

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:08.619
They behave like ODE IVPs.

00:17:08.619 --> 00:17:10.626
You determine whether
it's index 1 or not

00:17:10.626 --> 00:17:12.000
by asking how many
derivatives do

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.220
I have to take in order to get
a system of independent ODEs.

00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:18.770
So I put this
together with this,

00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:20.300
I have two independent ODEs.

00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:23.594
I could solve these, subject to
some set of initial conditions,

00:17:23.594 --> 00:17:25.010
and the solution
might be the same

00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:27.760
as the solution to the DAE.

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:29.690
Let's do stirred
tank example 2 now.

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:34.710
So here we go.

00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:36.390
They look very
similar, but now c2

00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:38.700
appears in the algebraic
equation instead of c1.

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:42.360
So let's take a derivative
of the algebraic equation,

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:44.960
and I get a differential
equation for c2.

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:47.250
But I already had a
differential equation for c2.

00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:49.620
I want a differential
equation for c1.

00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:50.660
So what do I do?

00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:53.380
While I know dc2
dt from up here.

00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:56.740
So let's substitute that
in and solve for c1.

00:17:56.740 --> 00:17:58.260
So a substitute
equation 1 in here.

00:17:58.260 --> 00:17:59.590
I solve for c1.

00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:01.320
Now, let's take
another derivative.

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:02.220
Call this equation 3.

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:04.770
Derivative of equation
3 now gives me

00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:07.080
a differential equation for c1.

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:09.770
It's also in terms of dc2 dt.

00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:10.560
If I want--

00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:12.570
I don't have to--
but if I want to,

00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:14.370
I can substitute for
that again to just get

00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:17.490
dc1 dt in terms of c1 and c2.

00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:21.390
But it took two
derivatives to generate

00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:26.430
a system of independent
ODEs from the DAEs.

00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:30.249
And this is called index 2.

00:18:30.249 --> 00:18:32.040
So it's a different
character from index 1.

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:33.070
We saw what happens.

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:35.940
We tend to lose an order
of accuracy at index 2.

00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:39.600
Somehow index 2 problems are
more sensitive than index 1

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:41.552
problems.

00:18:41.552 --> 00:18:42.510
Here's another example.

00:18:45.370 --> 00:18:49.610
So DAE sample 3 is going
to proceed the same way.

00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:53.549
So first we need a
differential equation.

00:18:53.549 --> 00:18:54.590
Which one's missing here?

00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:56.381
We don't have differential
equation for c1,

00:18:56.381 --> 00:18:58.280
and that's what
we're hunting for.

00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:00.590
So let's take a derivative
of the third equation,

00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:01.640
the algebraic equation.

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:03.710
We get c3 dot is gamma dot.

00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:05.630
And we already have an
equation for c3 dot.

00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:07.000
That was 2.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.780
So substitute 2 in.

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:12.039
So now we got c2 is gamma
dot, but we're really

00:19:12.039 --> 00:19:13.580
looking for something
in terms of c1,

00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:15.920
so let's take the
derivative again.

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:19.140
We've got c2 [? dot ?]
is gamma dot dot.

00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:21.930
Doesn't help us much, but c2
dot we know is equal to c1.

00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:25.110
So we substitute one more time
and take a third derivative.

00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:29.080
Now, we have a differential
equation for c1.

00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:31.170
And we have differential
equations for c2 and c3.

00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:36.340
We can take this is the
differential equation for c3.

00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:38.060
This is the differential
equation for c2.

00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:41.260
This is the differential
equation for c1.

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:44.500
Some subset of
these can be chosen,

00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:46.960
and we can replace
this algebraic equation

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:49.280
with a differential equation.

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:53.154
This is an index 3 DAE.

00:19:53.154 --> 00:19:55.070
It's not always a good
idea to replace the DAE

00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:58.370
system with these derivatives.

00:19:58.370 --> 00:19:59.330
I can write down--

00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:03.246
I can have a particular
function that's equal to 0

00:20:03.246 --> 00:20:05.120
and higher-order
derivatives of that function

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:06.620
are also equal to 0.

00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:08.900
But the solution to those
differential equations

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:11.477
are not necessarily
equal to that function.

00:20:11.477 --> 00:20:14.060
There are lots of functions that
might have this same property

00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:16.435
that its derivative-- certain
number of derivatives of it

00:20:16.435 --> 00:20:17.750
are equal to 0.

00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:19.610
So there have to be
extra initial conditions

00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:21.620
or constraints on
the solution that

00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:24.350
confine me to the
manifold of solutions

00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:25.740
that reflects the DAEs.

00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:28.679
We'll talk about consistent
initialization later on.

00:20:28.679 --> 00:20:30.220
And that's going to
fix this problem.

00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:32.000
So it's not always a
good idea to do this,

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.440
but it's one way
of understanding,

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:38.570
given this model, what sort of
sensitivity is it can exhibit.

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:40.503
We try to calculate
its differential index.

00:20:40.503 --> 00:20:41.003
Yes?

00:20:41.003 --> 00:20:47.282
AUDIENCE: So [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:47.282 --> 00:20:49.216
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:20:49.216 --> 00:20:49.715
Yes.

00:20:49.715 --> 00:20:50.772
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:50.772 --> 00:20:52.730
PROFESSOR: Well, we
have to be careful.

00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:55.880
We need to choose a set that
are independent of the others.

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:56.750
OK.

00:20:56.750 --> 00:20:59.135
So like these three are clearly
going to be independent,

00:20:59.135 --> 00:21:01.850
and it's going to be OK.

00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:04.687
It's going to be a problem if I
choose this one and these two.

00:21:04.687 --> 00:21:06.770
They're not going to be
independent of each other.

00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:08.895
So we have to select
independent ones from the set.

00:21:08.895 --> 00:21:11.525
It may not be obvious what
independent means in general.

00:21:11.525 --> 00:21:13.211
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:13.211 --> 00:21:15.631
PROFESSOR: 1, 2, 6
could also work, yes.

00:21:15.631 --> 00:21:16.130
Yes.

00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:25.906
So in general-- not in general.

00:21:25.906 --> 00:21:27.530
Let's talk about the
differential index

00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:29.810
of a semi-explicit DAE system.

00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:35.090
Remember semi-explicit meant
that the differential variables

00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:37.940
can be written as
x dot or dx dt is

00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:40.310
equal to some
function of x and y.

00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:43.010
Y are the algebraic
states, and they

00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:46.770
satisfy a separate equation, g
of x and y and t is equal to 0.

00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:49.170
Semi-explicit form.

00:21:49.170 --> 00:21:52.720
So with a semi-explicit
DAE, the differential index

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:55.880
is defined as the minimum
number of differentiations

00:21:55.880 --> 00:22:00.270
required to convert the DAE to
a system of independent ODEs.

00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:01.610
What does that mean?

00:22:01.610 --> 00:22:03.890
Means let's take the
algebraic equations

00:22:03.890 --> 00:22:06.170
and let's take a time
derivative of them.

00:22:06.170 --> 00:22:07.970
That will give us
a new function.

00:22:07.970 --> 00:22:10.370
Call it g1.

00:22:10.370 --> 00:22:14.090
It's going to be a function
of the differential

00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:18.020
state, the algebraic state,
and the time derivative

00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:20.116
of the algebraic state.

00:22:20.116 --> 00:22:21.740
It could also be a
function of the time

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:23.600
derivative of the
differential state,

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:27.310
but we know that in terms of f,
which is a function of x and y.

00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:30.169
So let's not try putting x
dot in there for convenience.

00:22:30.169 --> 00:22:31.460
Let's just write out like this.

00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:33.466
In principle, we can do this.

00:22:33.466 --> 00:22:34.840
Let's take two
derivatives of it.

00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:35.839
It will be the same way.

00:22:35.839 --> 00:22:37.790
It'll give us some
function g2, which

00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:39.950
is a function of
the differential

00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:42.410
state, the algebraic state,
and the time derivative

00:22:42.410 --> 00:22:44.360
of the algebraic state.

00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:46.660
Let's take as many
of these as we need.

00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:48.500
It will give us a
system of equations

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:51.860
that we can eventually solve
for the time derivatives of all

00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:55.939
the algebraic states and convert
this DAE to a system of ODEs.

00:22:55.939 --> 00:22:57.980
And the question is how
many of these derivatives

00:22:57.980 --> 00:23:00.140
do I have to take?

00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:01.700
Index 1, I need to take one.

00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:04.730
Index 2, I need both
sets of equations

00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:08.780
in order to get something that
I can actually solve for dy dt.

00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:11.450
Index 3, I get to take three
derivatives and higher.

00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:18.110
OK, so here's an example.

00:23:18.110 --> 00:23:20.090
Let's see if we can
work through this.

00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:23.930
So we have a DAE system.

00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:28.620
Can you calculate the
differential index

00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:29.310
of this system?

00:23:32.296 --> 00:23:32.796
Go ahead.

00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:01.546
Not 0.

00:24:01.546 --> 00:24:03.290
Not 0.

00:24:03.290 --> 00:24:06.430
ODE IVP is-- are
DAEs of index 0.

00:24:06.430 --> 00:24:08.190
They require no
derivatives to generate

00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:10.710
a system of ordinary
differential equations.

00:24:14.651 --> 00:24:15.400
What do you think?

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:17.160
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:19.010
PROFESSOR: Index 2 you say.

00:24:19.010 --> 00:24:20.270
How do you come to index 2?

00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:23.050
Why is it index 2?

00:24:23.050 --> 00:24:23.720
How'd you do it?

00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:25.354
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:25.354 --> 00:24:27.520
PROFESSOR: OK, differentiate
the algebraic equation.

00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:29.215
AUDIENCE: Stick it
in [INAUDIBLE] 4.

00:24:29.215 --> 00:24:30.640
You get c3 for 0.

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:33.015
Then you have to
differentiate [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:33.015 --> 00:24:36.770
PROFESSOR: Good so
differentiate this equation.

00:24:36.770 --> 00:24:39.960
Substitute for c1
dot and c2 dot.

00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:44.100
C1 minus c1 will be 0
c2 minus c2 will be 0.

00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:46.150
So you have 2c3 equals 0.

00:24:46.150 --> 00:24:47.690
That's still an
algebraic equation.

00:24:47.690 --> 00:24:51.000
We need one more derivative
to get a differential equation

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.510
for the only algebraic
state we have, c3.

00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:59.790
So one more derivative
will tell us dc3 dt is 0.

00:24:59.790 --> 00:25:02.700
So two derivatives to get
differential equations.

00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:04.221
It's an 2 to DAE.

00:25:04.221 --> 00:25:04.720
Sam?

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:07.090
SAM: What if you
can get c3 equals 0

00:25:07.090 --> 00:25:09.223
and just eliminate
it then wouldn't you

00:25:09.223 --> 00:25:12.278
write an equivalent some simple
equations, but that would be

00:25:12.278 --> 00:25:12.778
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:25:12.778 --> 00:25:13.867
PROFESSOR: You could.

00:25:13.867 --> 00:25:15.450
So we could write
an equivalent system

00:25:15.450 --> 00:25:18.500
of equations that says
instead of this equation,

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:20.490
report c3 equals 0.

00:25:20.490 --> 00:25:21.780
That's model formulation.

00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:23.430
Here we've given--
we're given a model,

00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:26.160
and we're asked
what index it is.

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:28.340
We could formulate
a different model,

00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:30.090
and the model will
have a different index.

00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:33.600
If I were to replace this
equation with c3 equals 0,

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:36.750
what would the index of
the DAE system be instead?

00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:39.270
Index 1 instead.

00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:41.760
I already told you index 2 is
harder to solve than index 1,

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:43.680
so if you can formulate
an index 1 DAE,

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:45.240
you should probably do it.

00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:47.767
But it may not be obvious
whether you have or haven't.

00:25:47.767 --> 00:25:49.350
So it's an issue of
model formulation.

00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:51.760
It's a great question.

00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:55.650
Does that distinction--
is that clear?

00:25:55.650 --> 00:25:57.370
Or is it a little--

00:25:57.370 --> 00:26:01.720
am I not making it
clear how this works?

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:02.950
Unresponsive.

00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:04.730
OK.

00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:06.630
It's OK.

00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:09.360
Let's-- there's a generic index
1 example that we can talk

00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:10.170
about actually.

00:26:10.170 --> 00:26:15.360
So let's take a look at a
semi-explicit DAE system.

00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:23.240
So we have x dot is f of xy
and t and 0 is g of xy and t.

00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:28.770
Let's take the time derivative
of the algebraic equation.

00:26:28.770 --> 00:26:32.010
So the total derivative
of g with respect to t

00:26:32.010 --> 00:26:33.990
is the Jacobian
of g with respect

00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:38.500
to x times dx dt plus
the Jacobian of g

00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:43.260
with respect to y times dy
dt plus the derivative of g--

00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:46.510
partial derivative of
g with respect to t.

00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:47.890
And now let's solve.

00:26:47.890 --> 00:26:52.030
Let's push the dy dt term to
the other side of the equation,

00:26:52.030 --> 00:26:53.830
and let's substitute for dx dt.

00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:57.920
We know dx dt is f, so you
get this equation here.

00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:01.520
If the Jacobian is full rank--

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:05.840
if dg dy is full rank, then
I can invert this matrix,

00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:08.420
and I automatically
get my system of ODEs

00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:09.905
for the algebraic states.

00:27:16.150 --> 00:27:18.970
What's problematic
about this equation

00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:21.289
when dg dy is not full rank?

00:27:21.289 --> 00:27:22.330
That should be a partial.

00:27:22.330 --> 00:27:23.570
That's sloppy.

00:27:23.570 --> 00:27:25.140
I was doing this
at 1:00 last night,

00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:27.040
so that's why that's there.

00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:31.600
What's the-- what's problematic
about this root finding problem

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:35.850
here if dg dy or the Jacobian
of g with respect to y

00:27:35.850 --> 00:27:36.880
is not full rank?

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:40.470
You recall?

00:27:45.401 --> 00:27:45.900
If--

00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:48.597
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:48.597 --> 00:27:50.930
PROFESSOR: Yes, you won't be
able to compute the inverse

00:27:50.930 --> 00:27:52.070
to get your dy dt's.

00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:52.962
That's true.

00:27:52.962 --> 00:27:54.920
Remember this Jacobian--
if it's not full rank,

00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:57.950
it's determinant is 0.

00:27:57.950 --> 00:28:00.200
There is no inverse
of this thing.

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:03.350
We talked once about the
systems of nonlinear equations

00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:08.120
and locally unique solutions,
the so-called inverse function

00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:09.130
theorem.

00:28:09.130 --> 00:28:13.010
We can only guarantee there is
a locally unique solution when

00:28:13.010 --> 00:28:15.040
I can invert this thing.

00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:17.000
That if I got in really
close to the solution,

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.890
it looked like a linear
system of equations.

00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:21.820
That linear system of
equations had a unique solution

00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:22.570
associated within.

00:28:22.570 --> 00:28:23.570
And everything was good.

00:28:23.570 --> 00:28:25.640
We were happy.

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:28.250
So index 1 DAEs
have that property.

00:28:28.250 --> 00:28:30.700
If I wanted to solve
this equation for y,

00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:34.739
there will be a locally
unique solution for y.

00:28:34.739 --> 00:28:36.530
Higher index DAEs don't
have that property.

00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:39.970
We know that's a sort of
unhappy generic circumstance

00:28:39.970 --> 00:28:42.370
to be in if we have to
solve this equation.

00:28:42.370 --> 00:28:44.710
It can be hard to find
those roots using,

00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:47.470
say, Newton-Raphson because
the Jacobian [? e ?]

00:28:47.470 --> 00:28:49.870
would need to become singular
during the root finding

00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:52.570
procedure.

00:28:52.570 --> 00:28:54.580
This is connected
intimately to what

00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:57.280
we did for systems of
nonlinear equations.

00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:59.410
So for an index 1 DAE,
you can show its index

00:28:59.410 --> 00:29:04.880
1 because this
Jacobian is invertible.

00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:07.480
Let's do some more examples
on differential index.

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:09.230
This seems to be the
most important thing.

00:29:09.230 --> 00:29:10.790
If I have a model,
what's its index

00:29:10.790 --> 00:29:13.040
because its index is going
to tell me how sensitive it

00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:16.840
is to small perturbations.

00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:17.991
So here's a model.

00:29:17.991 --> 00:29:19.740
It's the same as the
model you saw before,

00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:21.240
but now it's two mixing tanks.

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:26.770
So here comes an inlet flow
q1 carrying concentration c1.

00:29:26.770 --> 00:29:30.540
Out comes the same flow q1
carrying concentration c2.

00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:33.540
The mixer has volume v1.

00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:36.630
And then I blend
this with some more

00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:40.640
of whatever the solute
is at a flow rate of q2

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:43.140
and a concentration c3.

00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:44.910
And those both go
into this tank,

00:29:44.910 --> 00:29:48.910
and they come out concentration
c4, flow rate q1 plus q2,

00:29:48.910 --> 00:29:52.076
and this has volume v2.

00:29:52.076 --> 00:29:53.320
Does that look good?

00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:54.760
Well-posed model?

00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:58.525
OK, so here's your material
balances on the mixers.

00:29:58.525 --> 00:30:00.400
And I'm going to give
you different algebraic

00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:01.450
constraints.

00:30:01.450 --> 00:30:06.120
So this is a problem now where
we say measure c1 and c3.

00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:14.175
And we want to try
to predict c2 and c4.

00:30:14.175 --> 00:30:16.120
Can you figure out
the differential index

00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:17.160
of this DAE system?

00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:28.010
Feel free to talk to each other.

00:30:28.010 --> 00:30:28.510
It's OK.

00:30:59.210 --> 00:31:01.820
OK, the differential index is 1.

00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:03.410
This one's the easy one right?

00:31:03.410 --> 00:31:06.185
Just take one derivative
of the algebraic equations.

00:31:06.185 --> 00:31:11.000
Now, I've got dc2 dt,
dc4 dt, dc1 dt, dc3 dt.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:16.560
Differential index of 1 is
easy to solve as an ODE IVP.

00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:18.800
This is the natural
problem, too.

00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:22.640
It's useful to think about
the inputs c1, c3 and asking

00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:23.930
about what the outputs are.

00:31:23.930 --> 00:31:26.765
Physically, this problem
seems easier in nature.

00:31:32.570 --> 00:31:35.280
OK let's change it now.

00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:36.649
Same problem.

00:31:36.649 --> 00:31:38.440
But let's change the
algebraic constraints.

00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:42.040
Now, the algebraic constraint
is I measure c3 and c4,

00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:43.815
And I want to predict c1 and c2.

00:31:46.970 --> 00:31:48.450
What's the differential
index here?

00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:54.100
Yes.

00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:54.980
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:56.250
PROFESSOR: Sure.

00:32:56.250 --> 00:32:58.600
AUDIENCE: Why was this a
differential index of 1

00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:01.890
if you have to take a derivative
for c1 and this equation?

00:33:01.890 --> 00:33:03.800
PROFESSOR: Oh, good question.

00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:06.810
I'm going to push the slide
back, and I apologize for this.

00:33:06.810 --> 00:33:07.979
And I'll go back for it.

00:33:07.979 --> 00:33:10.270
So the question was why was
this differential index one

00:33:10.270 --> 00:33:13.100
if I had to take a derivative
of both this equation

00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:14.770
and that equation.

00:33:14.770 --> 00:33:17.260
So the way to think
about this conceptually

00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:21.789
is I took a derivative of
the algebraic equations,

00:33:21.789 --> 00:33:23.080
the set of algebraic equations.

00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:29.366
It was one time derivative
of a vector valued function.

00:33:29.366 --> 00:33:30.990
I can see where the
ambiguity is there.

00:33:30.990 --> 00:33:32.240
So it's important to be clear.

00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:35.230
I took one time derivative
over the equations that

00:33:35.230 --> 00:33:37.400
prescribe the algebraic states.

00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:42.280
That's the distinction.

00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:43.780
So this is index
1 because I needed

00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:55.600
one time derivative of this
type, dg dt of the entire set.

00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:56.100
Here we go.

00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:57.550
We're on this one.

00:33:57.550 --> 00:33:58.340
Prescribe c3.

00:33:58.340 --> 00:33:59.270
Prescribe c4.

00:33:59.270 --> 00:34:00.860
What is the
differential index now?

00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:07.712
What do you think?

00:34:07.712 --> 00:34:08.420
We got an answer?

00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:10.670
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:34:10.670 --> 00:34:11.449
I hear 2.

00:34:11.449 --> 00:34:13.412
I hear 3.

00:34:13.412 --> 00:34:14.860
I saw 3 like this.

00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:16.719
Almost mistook it for
a 2, but that's 3.

00:34:16.719 --> 00:34:17.590
Yes.

00:34:17.590 --> 00:34:18.337
It's 3.

00:34:18.337 --> 00:34:20.170
Let's see if we can
work through why it's 3.

00:34:23.330 --> 00:34:26.300
So I take a derivative of
the algebraic equations,

00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:27.260
one derivative.

00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:28.834
And after taking
that derivative,

00:34:28.834 --> 00:34:30.500
I'll get a differential
equation for one

00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:31.730
of the algebraic states.

00:34:31.730 --> 00:34:33.889
So c3 is taking care of.

00:34:33.889 --> 00:34:37.010
Now, I'm in the hunt for c1.

00:34:37.010 --> 00:34:38.780
So I have-- after
that first derivative,

00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:42.320
I have an equation
dc4 dt is gamma 2.

00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:45.530
And I know dc4 dt,
so I drop that in,

00:34:45.530 --> 00:34:49.670
and I get an algebraic equation
relating the derivative

00:34:49.670 --> 00:34:54.250
of gamma 2 to c2, c3, and c4.

00:34:54.250 --> 00:34:56.210
This new algebraic equation.

00:34:56.210 --> 00:34:59.120
This is like the g1
that I prescribed

00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:00.100
in the generic scene.

00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:02.725
I take a derivative of it again
because I'm in the hunt for c1.

00:35:02.725 --> 00:35:04.760
So I take the derivative
of this new equation,

00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:07.160
and I'll get a derivative
of c2, a derivative of c3,

00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:08.150
and a derivative of c4.

00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:09.620
And I know all those.

00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:11.140
I know the derivative of c2.

00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:13.140
I know the derivative of c4.

00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:16.130
And I know the derivative of
c3 from the previous level

00:35:16.130 --> 00:35:17.040
in the hierarchy.

00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:18.490
I figured that out already.

00:35:18.490 --> 00:35:19.810
So it's two derivatives.

00:35:19.810 --> 00:35:22.460
Still hasn't gotten me
a time derivative of c1.

00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:23.960
But when I make
those substitutions,

00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:27.390
I'll get an algebraic
equation in terms of c1.

00:35:27.390 --> 00:35:29.780
And I can take one
more derivative,

00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:31.740
and that will give me a dc1 dt.

00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:34.430
And I'll have an od
for c1, c2, c3, and c4.

00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:36.900
So its differential index 3.

00:35:41.050 --> 00:35:42.340
It makes sense sort of.

00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:47.630
I'm taking a measurement of an
output way down the line here.

00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:51.120
And I'm trying to predict
what the input was

00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:51.966
in the first place.

00:35:51.966 --> 00:35:53.340
It's easy to
imagine that there's

00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:56.220
a huge amount of sensitivity
in that calculation.

00:36:00.570 --> 00:36:02.182
Here's another one.

00:36:02.182 --> 00:36:03.640
What's the differential
index here?

00:36:10.310 --> 00:36:14.790
I'm now prescribing
c1 and c2, and I

00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:16.060
want you to tell me c3 and c4.

00:36:16.060 --> 00:36:24.870
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:25.670
Oh, good.

00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:26.870
Somebody noticed early on.

00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:29.300
So you say it's not possible.

00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:30.259
Right.

00:36:30.259 --> 00:36:31.175
Why isn't it possible?

00:36:31.175 --> 00:36:33.530
AUDIENCE: You take
derivatives of both of those--

00:36:33.530 --> 00:36:34.155
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:36:34.155 --> 00:36:37.202
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
you can't isolate c3--

00:36:37.202 --> 00:36:38.980
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:42.040
We'll never be able to isolate
a derivative of c3 here.

00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:44.230
There's actually there's
something wrong physically

00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:45.070
with this problem.

00:36:47.830 --> 00:36:52.780
Yes, somehow I'm supposed
to measure c1 and c2

00:36:52.780 --> 00:36:56.740
and use that to
predict c3 and c4.

00:36:56.740 --> 00:36:59.592
I don't know c4,
and c3 is an input.

00:36:59.592 --> 00:37:00.550
I don't know it either.

00:37:00.550 --> 00:37:05.260
How do I figure out an input
when I don't know the output?

00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:06.430
It's impossible.

00:37:06.430 --> 00:37:10.554
So this model is flawed.

00:37:10.554 --> 00:37:12.220
We can formulate any
model we want, pick

00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:15.920
any set of these variables
to prescribe algebraically,

00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:20.050
but not all of them are going to
admit solutions or make sense.

00:37:20.050 --> 00:37:21.820
There's no number of
derivatives that's

00:37:21.820 --> 00:37:25.024
going to give us a
closed system of ODEs.

00:37:25.024 --> 00:37:26.440
This again comes
back to the point

00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:29.832
that really DAEs is all
about model formulation.

00:37:29.832 --> 00:37:31.540
There are lots of good
numerical methods.

00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:34.090
They work like the numerical
methods for ODE IVPs.

00:37:34.090 --> 00:37:37.150
What's important is getting
consistent models down,

00:37:37.150 --> 00:37:39.850
models that, for
example, have solutions.

00:37:39.850 --> 00:37:41.650
You might feed this
to a DAE solver

00:37:41.650 --> 00:37:45.460
and get nonsense because I
can almost freely prescribe

00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:48.790
what c3 is, and I'll
get some answer for c4.

00:37:48.790 --> 00:37:50.450
Any c3 can give
me an answer here.

00:37:50.450 --> 00:37:53.740
So who knows whether this
numerical solver is sensitive

00:37:53.740 --> 00:37:56.999
or not to this particular
pathology in the problem

00:37:56.999 --> 00:37:57.790
we've written down.

00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:04.710
We got to speed up just a little
bit, and I'm sorry for that.

00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:06.540
So we looked at index 1.

00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:07.590
That was stirred tank 1.

00:38:07.590 --> 00:38:09.450
Index 2, that was
stirred tank 2.

00:38:09.450 --> 00:38:11.439
Index 3, that was
stirred tank 3.

00:38:11.439 --> 00:38:13.230
And one thing we saw
when we looked at them

00:38:13.230 --> 00:38:15.360
was this index 1 solution.

00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:17.970
It had pieces that
were proportional

00:38:17.970 --> 00:38:22.470
to this forcing function
gamma, this prescribed function

00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:26.710
in our system of equations and
proportional to its derivative.

00:38:26.710 --> 00:38:29.510
So if gamma is jumping around,
well, c1 will jump around.

00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:32.220
C2 is going to be smoothed
out version of gamma

00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:34.630
because it depends
on its integral.

00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:37.740
It's not very sensitive,
kind of like an ODE IVP.

00:38:37.740 --> 00:38:40.260
Doesn't really show any more
sensitivity than an ODE IVP

00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:41.250
does.

00:38:41.250 --> 00:38:43.350
The dynamics are different
for index 2, though.

00:38:43.350 --> 00:38:46.050
When we look at the
solution of the index 2 DAE,

00:38:46.050 --> 00:38:51.390
we found c2 goes like gamma,
but c1 has to go like gamma dot.

00:38:51.390 --> 00:38:54.549
So that's pretty sensitive if
you're making a measurement,

00:38:54.549 --> 00:38:56.090
and there's noise
in the measurement.

00:38:56.090 --> 00:38:58.170
How do you even know
what this derivative is?

00:38:58.170 --> 00:39:01.020
So c1 is wildly bouncing around.

00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:03.060
Our prediction of
what c1 is is--

00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:05.162
it's not going to be very good.

00:39:05.162 --> 00:39:09.330
Our solution of DAE example
3 when it told us c1

00:39:09.330 --> 00:39:11.730
was related to the
second derivative

00:39:11.730 --> 00:39:15.332
of the forcing function,
c2 to the first and c3

00:39:15.332 --> 00:39:17.040
was proportional to
the forcing function.

00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:19.100
So this is hugely
sensitive to changes

00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:20.100
in the forcing function.

00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:24.030
So the higher the index goes,
the greater the sensitivity

00:39:24.030 --> 00:39:25.425
to perturbations in the system.

00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:31.540
Here's another simple example.

00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:33.073
You have all that data,
actually, in your paper,

00:39:33.073 --> 00:39:35.614
so I won't ask you to do this
one given our time constraints.

00:39:35.614 --> 00:39:39.040
But here's-- mechanical systems
that have constraints are often

00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:41.260
indexed 3 DAEs it turns out.

00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:43.390
You can show this one
is an index 3 DAE.

00:39:43.390 --> 00:39:47.170
This is the case of a pendulum
swinging back and forth.

00:39:47.170 --> 00:39:50.740
So it's a-- change in
position is its velocity.

00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:53.230
Its acceleration
balances gravity,

00:39:53.230 --> 00:39:56.080
and there's some arm that
holds the pendulum in place.

00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:58.420
We can imagine that that
arm has some tension in it.

00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:01.510
It acts like a spring
with a spring constant

00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:05.260
that changes in time in order
to hold the pendulum at a fixed

00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:07.150
distance from its center.

00:40:07.150 --> 00:40:11.300
So two differential equations,
one algebraic equation.

00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:13.660
This is a differential
algebraic equation.

00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:16.270
You can imagine lots
of mechanical systems

00:40:16.270 --> 00:40:18.130
work in exactly this way.

00:40:18.130 --> 00:40:20.490
They can only move
along prescribed paths.

00:40:20.490 --> 00:40:23.679
They're constrained in how
far they can stretch or go.

00:40:23.679 --> 00:40:24.220
I don't know.

00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:26.310
If you're trying to design
a robot or something,

00:40:26.310 --> 00:40:29.180
DAEs are pretty important, and
they're all of index 3 type

00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:30.370
it turns out.

00:40:30.370 --> 00:40:33.730
So differential variables
here are x and v,

00:40:33.730 --> 00:40:36.700
and the algebraic variable
is the spring constant, k,

00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:40.690
which has got to adjust
dynamically in time in order

00:40:40.690 --> 00:40:41.460
to--

00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:43.150
got to get away
from the speaker--

00:40:43.150 --> 00:40:44.710
adjust dynamically
in time in order

00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:48.310
to provide just the right
stiffness to keep this going

00:40:48.310 --> 00:40:51.170
around on a circular orbit.

00:40:51.170 --> 00:40:54.280
So when-- let's suppose I
start with my pendulum down,

00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:56.170
and it's not moving,
then this has

00:40:56.170 --> 00:40:59.530
to be just stiff enough
to balance gravity.

00:40:59.530 --> 00:41:01.916
The pendulum is 90 degrees,
and it's not moving.

00:41:01.916 --> 00:41:03.040
I don't need any stiffness.

00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:04.570
K and just be 0.

00:41:04.570 --> 00:41:06.640
There's no forces to balance.

00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:08.350
The pendulum is
swinging around, and I

00:41:08.350 --> 00:41:10.570
have to be stiff enough
to balance gravity

00:41:10.570 --> 00:41:14.500
where I am and also counteract
any sort of centripetal

00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:16.180
[? acceleration. ?]
So this k has

00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:18.970
got to be wildly fluctuating.

00:41:18.970 --> 00:41:21.280
If I was trying to
control that k somehow

00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:25.000
to give this system these
particular dynamics,

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:29.270
you might imagine it's
very difficult to do.

00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:31.340
So there's your
differential variables.

00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:32.780
Here's your algebraic variable.

00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:34.437
You take a derivative
of this equation,

00:41:34.437 --> 00:41:36.020
you'll get a constraint
that tells you

00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:38.554
the velocity is orthogonal
to the position.

00:41:38.554 --> 00:41:39.220
Of course it is.

00:41:39.220 --> 00:41:41.330
I'm on a circular trajectory.

00:41:41.330 --> 00:41:43.430
You take a derivative
of this equation

00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:44.990
now, this algebraic equation.

00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:46.823
You'll get another
constraint that gives you

00:41:46.823 --> 00:41:49.760
some relationship
between k, x, and v

00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:51.860
but not a differential
equation for k.

00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:54.456
Take another derivative of
this algebraic equation,

00:41:54.456 --> 00:41:56.330
and you'll get a
differential equation for k.

00:41:56.330 --> 00:41:58.660
So in principle, I could
formulate a system of ODEs

00:41:58.660 --> 00:42:02.980
with dk dt, dx dt, dv dt
will be equivalent to this.

00:42:02.980 --> 00:42:05.596
It took three derivatives
to do this, though.

00:42:05.596 --> 00:42:07.220
So it's an incredibly
sensitive system.

00:42:07.220 --> 00:42:08.460
It's index 3 in nature.

00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:13.030
So if I transform
to this equivalent

00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:14.500
set of ODEs, the problem--

00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:17.140
we discussed this earlier--
is that the solutions may

00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:21.197
drift away from the
initial set of constraints.

00:42:21.197 --> 00:42:22.780
The solutions also
need the right sort

00:42:22.780 --> 00:42:24.210
of initial conditions.

00:42:24.210 --> 00:42:31.400
Here I know that at time
0, c3 better be gamma 0.

00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:33.860
I know that in the actual
solution to this problem,

00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:36.440
c3 dot was gamma dot.

00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:41.570
So at time 0, c2 better
be gamma dot of 0.

00:42:41.570 --> 00:42:44.840
And at time 0, c1 better
be gamma dot dot of 0.

00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:48.160
And if it's not,
then there's going

00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:50.800
to be some step jump or
some strange behavior

00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:53.210
in the solution to
this ODE system.

00:42:53.210 --> 00:42:55.675
So I have to choose the right
sort of initial conditions.

00:42:55.675 --> 00:42:57.850
If those initial conditions
aren't chosen correctly,

00:42:57.850 --> 00:42:59.090
then I'm not going to
get the right solution.

00:42:59.090 --> 00:43:01.990
I won't be constrained to the
manifold of solutions that's

00:43:01.990 --> 00:43:03.655
given by the original DAE.

00:43:06.446 --> 00:43:08.070
So here's some things
you need to know.

00:43:08.070 --> 00:43:12.680
Index 1, semi-explicit DAEs can
be safely handled in MATLAB.

00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:16.670
So ode15s, ode23t,
they have the ability

00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:18.870
to take an input of mass matrix.

00:43:18.870 --> 00:43:21.830
We discussed mass
matrix last time.

00:43:21.830 --> 00:43:24.055
And a right hand side to
the system of equations

00:43:24.055 --> 00:43:27.800
in f of x and t
and solve it just

00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:30.380
like all the other solvers,
all the other ODE IVP

00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:32.540
solvers in MATLAB.

00:43:32.540 --> 00:43:35.900
If it's not index 1,
MATLAB can catch it.

00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:39.110
So it'll try to look at the
Jacobian of f with respect

00:43:39.110 --> 00:43:40.970
to the variables
and the mass matrix

00:43:40.970 --> 00:43:45.680
and to infer from that what
the differential index is.

00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:48.759
And it will tell
you often times--

00:43:48.759 --> 00:43:50.550
I think depends which
package you're using.

00:43:50.550 --> 00:43:52.910
But if you're using certain
packages, it'll tell you.

00:43:52.910 --> 00:43:55.170
It's not index 1oe--

00:43:55.170 --> 00:43:56.360
DAE.

00:43:56.360 --> 00:43:57.770
We can't handle this.

00:43:57.770 --> 00:44:01.220
The methods built into
it aren't suitable.

00:44:01.220 --> 00:44:03.860
For generic DAEs, there
are specific DAE solvers.

00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:06.020
So something like
SUNDIALS or DAEPACK--

00:44:06.020 --> 00:44:09.020
this is Professor Barton's
software actually--

00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:13.050
that are designed to handle
DAEs up to some certain index

00:44:13.050 --> 00:44:13.580
instead.

00:44:13.580 --> 00:44:15.870
They're built to reliably
solve these problems.

00:44:15.870 --> 00:44:18.500
So we have robots with
constraints on them.

00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:21.779
We solve all sorts of problems
for chemical process systems

00:44:21.779 --> 00:44:22.820
that are of higher index.

00:44:22.820 --> 00:44:25.589
And the way we do it is using
specific numerical methods.

00:44:25.589 --> 00:44:27.380
They're based on the
same sorts of schemes,

00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:30.020
backwards difference
formulas, but careful analysis

00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:33.860
of the equations, which are
in general unstructured,

00:44:33.860 --> 00:44:35.360
the software doesn't
know beforehand

00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:38.630
what those equations look like,
but a careful analysis of them

00:44:38.630 --> 00:44:41.180
in order to figure out how
to minimize numerical errors

00:44:41.180 --> 00:44:45.620
and stay on the correct
solution manifold.

00:44:45.620 --> 00:44:47.930
As input to these,
though, we have

00:44:47.930 --> 00:44:49.440
to give initial conditions.

00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:52.675
So that's going to be the last
thing that we talk about here.

00:44:52.675 --> 00:44:54.050
And those initial
conditions have

00:44:54.050 --> 00:44:56.750
to be prescribed what
we call consistently,

00:44:56.750 --> 00:45:00.320
or we can get numerical errors,
or the software can just

00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:03.664
quit and throw an
error, or it can run off

00:45:03.664 --> 00:45:06.080
on some other solution manifold
that doesn't look anything

00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:08.060
like the solution we're after.

00:45:08.060 --> 00:45:11.360
The pendulum is an interesting
example to think about.

00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:13.220
So you might say,
well, what do I want

00:45:13.220 --> 00:45:14.712
to know about this pendulum.

00:45:14.712 --> 00:45:16.670
Maybe I want to know
where it started initially

00:45:16.670 --> 00:45:20.030
and what its velocity
initially was.

00:45:20.030 --> 00:45:23.240
Can I prescribe the initial
position of the pendulum

00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:25.680
arbitrarily?

00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:27.358
What do you think yes or no?

00:45:27.358 --> 00:45:28.186
AUDIENCE: No.

00:45:28.186 --> 00:45:28.851
PROFESSOR: No.

00:45:28.851 --> 00:45:29.350
Why not?

00:45:29.350 --> 00:45:29.920
Why no?

00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:33.010
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:33.010 --> 00:45:34.160
PROFESSOR: Good, yes.

00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:36.050
We know it's got a
fixed arm length.

00:45:36.050 --> 00:45:37.069
Can't pick any position.

00:45:37.069 --> 00:45:38.110
That's not going to work.

00:45:38.110 --> 00:45:40.790
It's got to satisfy that
algebraic constraint.

00:45:40.790 --> 00:45:45.110
Can I specify its
velocity arbitrarily?

00:45:45.110 --> 00:45:46.130
What you think?

00:45:46.130 --> 00:45:48.426
Can I give it any initial
velocity that mass

00:45:48.426 --> 00:45:49.550
at the end of the pendulum?

00:45:49.550 --> 00:45:50.350
AUDIENCE: No.

00:45:50.350 --> 00:45:51.001
PROFESSOR: No.

00:45:51.001 --> 00:45:51.500
Why not?

00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:52.448
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:52.448 --> 00:45:53.870
PROFESSOR: What's that?

00:45:53.870 --> 00:45:56.714
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:56.714 --> 00:45:58.540
PROFESSOR: Well,
explain that to me,

00:45:58.540 --> 00:46:02.170
though, because I had
equations for the velocity

00:46:02.170 --> 00:46:04.870
and for that
acceleration and then

00:46:04.870 --> 00:46:08.390
an equation that told me that
the length of this moment arm

00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:10.550
had a certain length
associated with it.

00:46:10.550 --> 00:46:13.899
So why does that
constrain the velocity?

00:46:13.899 --> 00:46:14.440
You're right.

00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:15.160
It does.

00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:16.326
I'm not saying you're wrong.

00:46:16.326 --> 00:46:17.370
You're right, but why?

00:46:17.370 --> 00:46:19.161
Those initial three
equations don't tell me

00:46:19.161 --> 00:46:21.917
anything about the initial
velocity was supposed to be.

00:46:21.917 --> 00:46:23.500
We know something
about the trajectory

00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:25.083
this is supposed to
sweep out, though.

00:46:25.083 --> 00:46:27.397
It's supposed to sweep
out a circular trajectory.

00:46:27.397 --> 00:46:29.230
And the velocity in
that circular trajectory

00:46:29.230 --> 00:46:32.470
is always going to be
orthogonal to the moment time.

00:46:32.470 --> 00:46:35.770
And that equation
actually-- it appeared.

00:46:35.770 --> 00:46:39.080
It appeared when we took a
derivative of the constraint.

00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:41.950
So this was a hidden constraint.

00:46:41.950 --> 00:46:42.726
It's secret.

00:46:42.726 --> 00:46:45.100
You didn't know it was there
until you took a derivative,

00:46:45.100 --> 00:46:47.980
and you tried to go and figure
out what index this was.

00:46:47.980 --> 00:46:50.920
Then you discovered velocity
and position or orthogonal

00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:52.070
to each other.

00:46:52.070 --> 00:46:55.150
My initial condition
should respect that.

00:46:55.150 --> 00:46:56.050
How can they not?

00:46:56.050 --> 00:46:57.883
The initial conditions
have to be a solution

00:46:57.883 --> 00:47:00.710
to the equations as well.

00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:05.110
So now can the initial stiffness
be specified arbitrarily?

00:47:05.110 --> 00:47:06.590
No.

00:47:06.590 --> 00:47:08.650
There was also an
algebraic equation

00:47:08.650 --> 00:47:10.600
that popped up at some
point right here when

00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:12.433
I took the second
derivative, which tells me

00:47:12.433 --> 00:47:13.990
how the stiffness
has to be related

00:47:13.990 --> 00:47:15.520
to position and velocities.

00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:20.410
It's also hidden inside
the structure of this DAE.

00:47:20.410 --> 00:47:22.866
So this-- again goes
to model formulation,

00:47:22.866 --> 00:47:25.240
what are the initial conditions
that I have to prescribe?

00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:26.860
If I prescribe the
right ones, I'll

00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:30.670
get a solution that matches
the dynamics of the problem I

00:47:30.670 --> 00:47:32.010
was actually interested in.

00:47:32.010 --> 00:47:33.970
If I prescribe them
incorrectly, who

00:47:33.970 --> 00:47:35.830
knows what's going to result?

00:47:35.830 --> 00:47:38.352
We can't really predict.

00:47:38.352 --> 00:47:40.060
Depends on the solver
we're working with.

00:47:42.820 --> 00:47:46.310
Here's a formal
way to think of it.

00:47:46.310 --> 00:47:48.150
So usually in an
initial value problem,

00:47:48.150 --> 00:47:51.380
usually we want to know what's--

00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:53.510
for these first
order difference--

00:47:53.510 --> 00:47:57.290
differential equations, what's
the initial value of the state,

00:47:57.290 --> 00:48:00.230
and what's the initial
value of its derivative.

00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:05.559
That completely specifies what's
going on at the beginning.

00:48:05.559 --> 00:48:07.100
One way to think
about these problems

00:48:07.100 --> 00:48:19.420
is I've got this equation
that I want to solve.

00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:22.381
I could think in some
sense that x and x dot

00:48:22.381 --> 00:48:23.630
are independent of each other.

00:48:23.630 --> 00:48:30.840
I could always write this is
something like an equation

00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:33.150
for f of x and z.

00:48:33.150 --> 00:48:35.340
And then I could add
some extra information

00:48:35.340 --> 00:48:42.430
that tells me actually
x dot is the same as z.

00:48:42.430 --> 00:48:46.040
So initially, I would like to
know the values of x and z,

00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:47.340
that z is x dot.

00:48:47.340 --> 00:48:51.460
So I'd like to know initially
the values of x dot and x.

00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:54.250
And tell me where
I start, and these

00:48:54.250 --> 00:48:57.220
need to be consistent with
the initial value problem

00:48:57.220 --> 00:48:58.030
that I specified.

00:48:58.030 --> 00:49:00.210
If I'm doing an index
0, an ODE IVP, at least

00:49:00.210 --> 00:49:01.210
be consistent with this.

00:49:01.210 --> 00:49:04.060
So if you tell me
x naught, that I

00:49:04.060 --> 00:49:06.280
should put x into this
equation, then that

00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:08.770
should tell me what x dot is.

00:49:08.770 --> 00:49:14.140
If you tell me x dot, then
I should solve my governing

00:49:14.140 --> 00:49:17.710
equation for x naught.

00:49:17.710 --> 00:49:22.150
You could tell me some equation
that relates x naught and x

00:49:22.150 --> 00:49:24.700
dot initially, and
now I got to solve

00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:27.760
this equation in conjunction
with my governing equation

00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:28.940
to determine these--

00:49:28.940 --> 00:49:31.210
this set of values.

00:49:31.210 --> 00:49:34.600
I'd like to know both of
these things initially.

00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:38.770
The fully-implicit DAE, I
really have two n unknowns here.

00:49:38.770 --> 00:49:41.380
I don't know x, and
I don't know x dot.

00:49:41.380 --> 00:49:44.530
And I've only got n
equations for those.

00:49:44.530 --> 00:49:47.440
So apparently there's n degrees
of freedom to specify here.

00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:49.180
I need n more
equations to say what

00:49:49.180 --> 00:49:50.950
those initial conditions are.

00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:53.110
And these hidden constraints
I point out actually

00:49:53.110 --> 00:49:55.690
reduce the number of
degrees of freedom.

00:49:55.690 --> 00:49:59.650
The fact that these are
not index 0 problems

00:49:59.650 --> 00:50:02.710
but have a finite index will
introduce extra constraints

00:50:02.710 --> 00:50:05.050
that reduce the number
of degrees of freedom

00:50:05.050 --> 00:50:08.734
or the number of other
equations I can use to specify

00:50:08.734 --> 00:50:09.775
those initial conditions.

00:50:09.775 --> 00:50:11.020
Does that make sense?

00:50:11.020 --> 00:50:14.230
Let me give you some examples,
and then I'll let you go.

00:50:14.230 --> 00:50:16.930
So if I have a problem that
has separate differential

00:50:16.930 --> 00:50:18.400
states and algebraic
states, this

00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:23.291
is like f of x dot x and y and
t equal 0, the set of things

00:50:23.291 --> 00:50:24.290
that I need to specify--

00:50:24.290 --> 00:50:27.787
I need the initial derivative
of the differential state,

00:50:27.787 --> 00:50:29.620
the initial value of
the differential state,

00:50:29.620 --> 00:50:32.130
and the initial value
of the algebraic state.

00:50:32.130 --> 00:50:34.930
I'd actually need to know the
initial value of the derivative

00:50:34.930 --> 00:50:36.820
of the algebraic
state here because I

00:50:36.820 --> 00:50:39.220
don't need that to satisfy
this initial equation.

00:50:41.950 --> 00:50:44.310
Let's look at a
couple of examples.

00:50:44.310 --> 00:50:47.400
So here's stirred
tank example 1.

00:50:47.400 --> 00:50:50.050
I converted to a system of
ODEs by taking the derivative

00:50:50.050 --> 00:50:51.680
of equation 2 here.

00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:53.740
So here's my two ODEs.

00:50:53.740 --> 00:50:55.682
I got to look back at
my initial equations

00:50:55.682 --> 00:50:57.890
and see how do they constrain
the initial conditions.

00:50:57.890 --> 00:51:01.080
So equation 2 tells me
that c1 initially better

00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:02.675
be gamma initially.

00:51:02.675 --> 00:51:04.300
Otherwise, my initial
condition doesn't

00:51:04.300 --> 00:51:08.080
satisfy the governing equations
of the model that I wrote down.

00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:11.260
Equation 1 tells me that
the derivative of c2

00:51:11.260 --> 00:51:14.740
initially better be related
to the derivative of c1

00:51:14.740 --> 00:51:15.910
and the derivative of n--

00:51:15.910 --> 00:51:20.650
I'm sorry to the value of c1
and the value of c2 initially.

00:51:20.650 --> 00:51:26.350
This third equation that I came
up with, it doesn't constrain.

00:51:26.350 --> 00:51:29.470
It's a derivative of one of the
original algebraic variables,

00:51:29.470 --> 00:51:31.877
so it doesn't constrain
that original set of--

00:51:31.877 --> 00:51:34.210
I need to know the initial
condition on the differential

00:51:34.210 --> 00:51:36.824
variables, the derivative of
the differential variables,

00:51:36.824 --> 00:51:37.990
and the algebraic variables.

00:51:37.990 --> 00:51:40.094
This only tells me something
about the derivative

00:51:40.094 --> 00:51:41.260
of this algebraic variables.

00:51:41.260 --> 00:51:43.190
This equation doesn't give
me any other constraints.

00:51:43.190 --> 00:51:45.310
So I just got a free
variable that I can specify.

00:51:45.310 --> 00:51:46.160
One more equation.

00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:47.690
It can be whatever I want.

00:51:47.690 --> 00:51:50.500
So maybe I say c2
of 0c0, or maybe I

00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:54.160
say there's some relationship
between c1 of 0 and c2 0.

00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:57.520
Or maybe I say that c2
of 0 and c2 prime of 0

00:51:57.520 --> 00:51:59.170
are related in some way.

00:51:59.170 --> 00:52:01.690
Whatever I specify,
I have a system

00:52:01.690 --> 00:52:05.837
of three equations for three
unknowns, c1 of 0, c2 dot of 0,

00:52:05.837 --> 00:52:07.270
and c2 of 0.

00:52:07.270 --> 00:52:09.220
I need to have a unique
solution to that.

00:52:09.220 --> 00:52:11.890
Otherwise, there's going to be a
problem solving for it in time,

00:52:11.890 --> 00:52:13.010
the system of equations.

00:52:13.010 --> 00:52:15.343
So I have to choose this one
consistent with these other

00:52:15.343 --> 00:52:18.220
ones, but beyond that I'm OK.

00:52:22.549 --> 00:52:26.320
Here's stirred tank example 2.

00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:29.230
So I take a derivative
of equation 2,

00:52:29.230 --> 00:52:32.053
and that gives me a differential
equation for dc2 dt.

00:52:32.053 --> 00:52:33.790
Actually, I already
had one of those,

00:52:33.790 --> 00:52:36.460
so I substitute
for dc2 dt, and I

00:52:36.460 --> 00:52:41.130
take another derivative to get
a differential equation for c1.

00:52:41.130 --> 00:52:43.070
And let's ask about
the initial conditions.

00:52:43.070 --> 00:52:47.730
So the initial algebraic
equation, it constrained dc2--

00:52:47.730 --> 00:52:48.750
it constrained c2.

00:52:48.750 --> 00:52:52.360
It said c2 of 0
has to be gamma 0.

00:52:52.360 --> 00:52:57.130
The initial differential
equation told me that c1 of 0

00:52:57.130 --> 00:53:01.670
had to be equal to c2 of 0
plus v over q, c2 dot of 0.

00:53:01.670 --> 00:53:05.260
Remember, I need three equations
to specify c2 of 0, c1 of 0,

00:53:05.260 --> 00:53:07.520
c2 dot of 0.

00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:09.760
I actually can't
specify c2 dot of 0

00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:14.200
freely because in the process
of deriving this differential

00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:17.080
equation here so that I
had dc1 dt and dc2 dt,

00:53:17.080 --> 00:53:23.590
I introduced a constraint
on the derivatives of c2.

00:53:23.590 --> 00:53:28.150
And this tells me that c2 dot
of 0 has to be gamma dot of 0.

00:53:28.150 --> 00:53:31.380
There are no free
variables to specify.

00:53:31.380 --> 00:53:33.050
There's three equations.

00:53:33.050 --> 00:53:35.230
Two of them come from the
initial system of DAEs,

00:53:35.230 --> 00:53:40.240
and the third one is related
to this extra equation that

00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:42.850
popped up as we tried
to define the index.

00:53:42.850 --> 00:53:46.370
It's an implicit
constraint on the problem.

00:53:46.370 --> 00:53:48.060
Does that make sense?

00:53:48.060 --> 00:53:50.390
I can't specify
these things freely.

00:53:50.390 --> 00:53:55.690
They're specified by the
signal that I measured gamma.

00:53:55.690 --> 00:53:58.070
There are two
examples here that you

00:53:58.070 --> 00:54:01.250
should be able to work through.

00:54:01.250 --> 00:54:03.695
One is an index 2 example,
and one is an index 1 example.

00:54:03.695 --> 00:54:05.570
We're not going to have
time to go over them.

00:54:05.570 --> 00:54:06.906
Sorry for that.

00:54:06.906 --> 00:54:08.030
But they work the same way.

00:54:08.030 --> 00:54:13.260
So convert to a system of ODEs,
ask what initial conditions

00:54:13.260 --> 00:54:15.690
will satisfy the initial
constraints and were there

00:54:15.690 --> 00:54:17.910
any other--

00:54:17.910 --> 00:54:19.770
were there any other
constraining equations

00:54:19.770 --> 00:54:20.784
that popped up?

00:54:20.784 --> 00:54:22.950
So if you work through this
example, you'll find out

00:54:22.950 --> 00:54:27.370
there was a hidden strength that
either the initial derivatives

00:54:27.370 --> 00:54:29.535
of c1 and c2 sum
together have to be 0

00:54:29.535 --> 00:54:32.730
or equivalently the
initial value of c3

00:54:32.730 --> 00:54:33.840
had to be equal to 0.

00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:35.400
You can take this
constraint in either place.

00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:36.690
Maybe you want to
take both of them

00:54:36.690 --> 00:54:38.400
to make sure that
it's always satisfied,

00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:40.969
that there is no numerical
error that drives you off

00:54:40.969 --> 00:54:41.760
of this constraint.

00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:43.860
It's OK to have these
things over constrained.

00:54:43.860 --> 00:54:47.371
It's just not OK to have
them under constrained.

00:54:47.371 --> 00:54:48.870
And you'll find out
that while there

00:54:48.870 --> 00:54:52.140
were five things I could pick,
the derivatives, and the values

00:54:52.140 --> 00:54:54.810
of c1 and c2, and then
the algebraic variable c3

00:54:54.810 --> 00:54:55.330
initially.

00:54:55.330 --> 00:54:57.510
So there are only four
constraints-- for equations

00:54:57.510 --> 00:54:58.890
here for the initial conditions.

00:54:58.890 --> 00:54:59.848
I get to pick one more.

00:54:59.848 --> 00:55:01.560
I can get it however I want.

00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:04.410
Just has to be
consistent with these.

00:55:04.410 --> 00:55:05.740
There's one more example.

00:55:05.740 --> 00:55:08.377
Again, should work
through these on your own.

00:55:08.377 --> 00:55:09.460
But you do the same thing.

00:55:09.460 --> 00:55:12.650
Convert to a system of ODEs.

00:55:12.650 --> 00:55:14.291
You'll find out that
when you do this,

00:55:14.291 --> 00:55:16.040
you'll get a differential
equation for c3.

00:55:16.040 --> 00:55:17.840
It didn't introduce
any new constraints

00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:21.094
on c1 dot, c2 dot,
or c1, c2, and c3.

00:55:21.094 --> 00:55:23.510
So you just need to satisfy--
your initial conditions have

00:55:23.510 --> 00:55:25.310
to satisfy the
initial equations,

00:55:25.310 --> 00:55:28.130
and you can put in two
more conditions, whatever

00:55:28.130 --> 00:55:29.210
you want them to be.

00:55:29.210 --> 00:55:31.130
Add five unknowns and
only three equations

00:55:31.130 --> 00:55:33.170
for the initial conditions.

00:55:33.170 --> 00:55:34.500
And that's it.

00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:36.810
So thank you very much.
