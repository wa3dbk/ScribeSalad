00:00:23.125 --> 00:00:24.750
PROFESSOR: So today
we're going to talk

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.160
about partial
differential equations.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.035
Let me just give a quick
review where we are.

00:00:28.035 --> 00:00:31.640
So we're going to have
a PDE lecture today.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.450
Then Professor Swan is going
to do a review on Friday.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.980
There's no lecture on Monday,
but you have the quiz, too,

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.780
Monday night.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.452
Wednesday, next week is
Veterans Day so it's a holiday.

00:00:46.452 --> 00:00:47.535
There's no classes at MIT.

00:00:50.042 --> 00:00:51.750
So the next time I'll
be lecturing to you

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.410
will be a week from Friday.

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.340
The homework following
the quiz will be posted

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.620
and so you guys can
get started on that.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.140
That homework involves
a COMSOL problem

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.480
which, for those of you who
had trouble with COMSOL,

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:07.680
might take some extra
time, since it's

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.971
the first time you're doing it.

00:01:08.971 --> 00:01:11.940
So I would suggest you at
least give it a try early.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.010
I'm sure the TAs would
be very happy to help you

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.190
to force COMSOL to cooperate.

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:18.540
Bend COMSOL to your will.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.990
All right, so we're going to
talk about partial differential

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.800
equations.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.002
And, as it sounds,
what's different

00:01:28.002 --> 00:01:29.710
about a partial
differential equation is,

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.760
it has partial
derivatives in it.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.880
And so we have a lot
of equations like this.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.275
So for example, I work
a lot on this equation.

00:02:01.302 --> 00:02:02.510
It's a poor choice, isn't it?

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.120
OK, so this is the conservation
equation for a chemical species

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.710
in a reacting flow.

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:40.870
So the change in the mass
fraction of the species z,

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.510
at a point, xyz at time, t.

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.290
That differential is given by
a diffusion term, a convection

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.010
term, and a reaction term.

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.990
So this is a pretty
famous equation.

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.950
This is part of the
Navier-Stokes equations

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.980
for the whole reactive
flow system, which

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.600
I hope you guys
have seen already,

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.784
and for sure you will see,
if you haven't seen them yet.

00:03:01.784 --> 00:03:04.200
And there's a lot of other
partial differential equations.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.740
I work a lot, also, on
the Schrodinger equation.

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.650
That's another partial
differential equation.

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:08.790
And what's special about
the partial differential

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.720
equations is that, in this
case, this partial derivative

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.820
is respect to time, holding all
the spatial coordinates fixed.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.710
And these partial
derivatives are respect

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:22.280
to space, holding time fixed.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.800
A very important thing
about partial derivatives,

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.450
which you probably have
encountered in 1040 already,

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.650
is, it really depends
what you hold fixed.

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.420
And you get different
results if you

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:35.920
hold different things fixed.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.560
Now the implication, when you
write an equation like this,

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.090
is that whatever
partials you see--

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.810
When I wrote this,
if I have this

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.670
and it has a term
that's like d squared,

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.400
dx squared, is one of
the terms in this thing.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.340
This says t.

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.200
This says x.

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.020
The convention is, oh boy,
I better hold x fixed.

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:58.970
And here must be, I
must hold t fixed.

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.180
Because there's another
one in the same equation.

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.490
Now, you can change
coordinates however you want.

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:06.156
Just really watch out
that you carefully

00:04:06.156 --> 00:04:08.660
follow the rules
about what you hold

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.040
fixed, when you change things.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.249
Otherwise you can cause
all kinds of craziness.

00:04:13.249 --> 00:04:15.290
Now you guys probably took
multivariable calculus

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.440
at some point in
your distant past.

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.440
And they told you very
carefully what the rules were.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:21.680
So follow them.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.235
And I suppose, when you're
doing thermo right now?

00:04:24.235 --> 00:04:26.610
Have you started to do all
this partial derivative stuff?

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.485
Yeah, so you've seen
how completely confusing

00:04:28.485 --> 00:04:30.984
it can be with negative signs
showing up all over the place.

00:04:30.984 --> 00:04:32.330
And other things like this.

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.230
I don't know if you've
encountered this yet?

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:37.890
At least, I thought it was
confusing when I took it.

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:39.620
So just be aware.

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.640
It's the same thing.

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.740
Now, often you do want
to change the equations.

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:47.740
So you can write down
an equation like this.

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.210
But, for example, if you
have a special symmetry

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.900
of the problem, like it's
cylindrical, for example,

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.391
then you might want to change
the cylindrical coordinates.

00:04:55.391 --> 00:04:56.890
And then you have
to just be careful

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:59.150
that you write that correct
Laplacian and cylindrical

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:00.070
coordinates.

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:03.310
Make sure it doesn't mess
up anything about what

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:05.350
you're holding fixed.

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.550
Sometimes you might want
to be crafty and use

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:09.550
some weirdo coordinates.

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.100
For example, if you wanted to
solve the Schrodinger equation

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.404
for h2 plus, it
turns out there's

00:05:14.404 --> 00:05:15.820
a special coordinate
system called

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:17.480
the elliptic coordinate system.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.771
And in that coordinate system,
the partial differential

00:05:19.771 --> 00:05:20.830
equation is separable.

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.040
And so, if you do it in
that coordinate system,

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.831
you can actually solve
analytical solution,

00:05:23.831 --> 00:05:26.860
which is pretty unusual for
the Schroedinger equation.

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.830
But it's a pretty
goofball coordinate system

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:32.770
and you really have to
watch out, when you convert,

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.990
to make sure you
do it just right.

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:37.390
But it's just the rules,
chain rule and the rules

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:40.032
about how to keep track of
what's being held constant.

00:05:40.032 --> 00:05:41.740
And when you change,
will tell them, how,

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.323
being held constant,
how to change it.

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:50.710
Now in principle,
this problem is

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:52.870
like no different
than the ODE BBP

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:54.370
problems we were just doing.

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:57.160
You just have a few more terms.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.740
And so, you can
use finite element.

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.200
You can use finite differences.

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:05.230
You can use basis set methods.

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:07.360
And it's really no different.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.410
So all those methods
basically look the same.

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:16.300
You just get equations that
have more unknowns in them.

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.720
Because, for example, if you're
using finite element methods

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:23.260
or basis set methods
with a local basis set,

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:27.310
you need to put points both
in the x direction and the y

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:29.320
direction, and in this
case, the z direction,

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.270
and then maybe also
in the time direction.

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:33.010
So now you have a
lot of mesh points

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:34.700
in all different directions.

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:36.730
And so you get a
lot of mesh points.

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:39.437
And so fundamentally,
there's no problem,

00:06:39.437 --> 00:06:41.020
but in practice,
there's a big problem

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:43.760
if the number of unknowns
gets to be so large.

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.170
That's the main problem.

00:06:47.901 --> 00:06:48.650
So think about it.

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:50.620
You have some kind of
equation like this.

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:53.109
It's in three spatial
dimensions and in time.

00:06:53.109 --> 00:06:54.650
How many points do
you think you need

00:06:54.650 --> 00:07:00.150
to discretize your solution
in the spatial coordinate?

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:02.550
There might be somewhere,
might be 100, I don't know,

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:04.310
points might be enough.

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:05.920
And so now I have x and y and z.

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:11.242
So I'll need, well, just in
COMSOL, you saw this on Monday.

00:07:11.242 --> 00:07:12.700
Suppose I just have
two dimensions.

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:16.790
Suppose I just have x and z.

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:19.610
And I start putting points in.

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:22.044
Well, I want to have some
points along this way.

00:07:22.044 --> 00:07:23.960
And I want to have some
points along this way.

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:29.360
And so, I actually have an
unknown here and an unknown

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.270
here, and one there
and one there,

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:33.080
and one there and one there.

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:34.480
There's quite a few of them.

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.020
I think of how
many points I have.

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:41.470
Each of those is a point where
I have a little basis function.

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:45.179
And each one of those has a
magnitude of how much weight

00:07:45.179 --> 00:07:46.720
I have on that basis
function, things

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:49.199
they called the d's before
in the basis functions.

00:07:49.199 --> 00:07:50.240
And I have a lot of them.

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.080
Now, it's going to be, if
I have 100 points this way

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:54.850
and 100 points this way, I have
10,000 of these little points.

00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:57.910
That means I have 10,000
unknowns I have to solve for.

00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:00.612
10,000 unknowns are a lot harder
to solve for than 100 unknowns.

00:08:00.612 --> 00:08:03.070
and if you saw, on some of the
problems we did with the ODE

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:04.759
BBP problems, even
with 100 unknowns,

00:08:04.759 --> 00:08:06.550
we were having a lot
of trouble, sometimes,

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:08.380
to get the real solution.

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:09.520
All right?

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:11.680
So you can just see how
it just gets to be, like,

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:12.850
a big numerical problem.

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:13.891
So that's two dimensions.

00:08:13.891 --> 00:08:16.030
The third dimension, you'll
get another 100 times

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:16.750
as many points.

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:18.860
You might have a
million unknowns.

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:20.610
And once you get up
to a million unknowns,

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:22.960
we're starting to talk
serious math, now.

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:24.670
OK?

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:27.720
Even for your good
computers that you have.

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:31.470
In addition, it's not just you
have the number of mesh points,

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:34.600
but it's the number
of mesh points

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:39.390
times the number of
variables at each mesh point.

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:44.039
So in the Navier-Stokes
equations, what variables

00:08:44.039 --> 00:08:44.858
do you have?

00:08:44.858 --> 00:08:49.250
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:50.130
PROFESSOR: Louder.

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:51.050
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:52.070
PROFESSOR: Velocity
and pressure, OK.

00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:53.330
So you have pressure.

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:57.277
We have the different
components of velocity.

00:08:57.277 --> 00:08:58.275
What else we got?

00:09:02.766 --> 00:09:04.263
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:04.263 --> 00:09:06.259
PROFESSOR: Sorry, what?

00:09:06.259 --> 00:09:07.840
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:09.140
PROFESSOR: Yeah, though, yeah.

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:11.340
Density or temperature.

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:12.550
Yeah, temperature maybe, so.

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:14.830
So maybe temperature would
be what you might use.

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:17.980
And then you'd have a state
function maybe with these guys.

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:20.826
What else would you have?

00:09:20.826 --> 00:09:22.700
So then you'd have all
these species, right,?

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:24.330
The mesh fractions
are all the species.

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.400
So you have, like,
y, species one.

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:27.925
Mesh fraction, species two.

00:09:27.925 --> 00:09:28.850
However many you got.

00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:33.680
So that's a pretty
big set of variables

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:37.280
and you need to know all
these numbers at each point.

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:38.560
So this might be--

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:39.560
how many have we've got?

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:42.571
One, two, three, four, five,
plus however many species

00:09:42.571 --> 00:09:43.070
we have?

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:49.780
So this is n species
plus 5 times the mesh.

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:53.310
And I told you the mesh
was what, a million?

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:56.640
So maybe I have 10
million unknowns.

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:05.930
So the issue, to a large
extent, has to do with just,

00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:07.160
can I solve it?

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:11.050
Can I solve a system
of 10 million unknowns?

00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:13.360
10 million equations,
10 million unknowns.

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.652
All right, so that's
going to be one big issue.

00:10:15.652 --> 00:10:17.860
Now the other issues, we
still have the same problems

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:20.680
we had in ordinary
differential equations,

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:22.702
that we have to worry
about numerical stability.

00:10:22.702 --> 00:10:24.910
We have to worry about
actually, is the whole problem

00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:26.410
even stable to begin with?

00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:27.860
Physically?

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:30.040
Because if it's not stable
physically, then probably

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:33.100
we're not going to
get a stable solution.

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:35.800
So you have all those
kinds of problems

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:37.780
that we had before
in the ODE case,

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:40.452
and now it's just sort
of amplified by the fact,

00:10:40.452 --> 00:10:42.910
now we have boundary conditions
in more than one dimension.

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:45.311
So we have multiple
chances to screw it up.

00:10:45.311 --> 00:10:47.560
And we're trying to figure
out how to set the boundary

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:49.240
conditions correctly.

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:51.310
And we have to worry
about stability in all

00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:54.030
the different directions.

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:55.780
So those are the
different kinds of things

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:56.960
we have to worry about.

00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:00.008
But it's all the same problems
you had before, just amplified.

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:08.280
Now, because of this problem
of the very large number

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:12.900
of unknowns,
currently, if you have

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:16.680
a problem that has
two dimensions,

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:18.690
you can kind of very
routinely solve it.

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:20.880
And things like
COMSOL on your laptop,

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:22.410
you can usually do those.

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:24.540
When you get up to
three dimensions,

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:28.290
you might be able to solve it or
might not be able to solve it.

00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:30.930
And it could be, like, a
really big challenge sometimes

00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:31.930
to solve it.

00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:34.430
And then in reality, we have
problems like the Navier-Stokes

00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:35.513
is four dimensions, right?

00:11:35.513 --> 00:11:36.940
There's time, as well.

00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:38.646
So then that gets
to be really hard.

00:11:38.646 --> 00:11:40.020
And then the
Schrodinger equation

00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:43.590
has three times the number of
electrons dimensions in it.

00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:46.470
So that gets impossibly hard.

00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:49.050
And so, specialized
methods are developed

00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:52.105
to handle those systems with
a lot of dimensionality.

00:11:52.105 --> 00:11:53.730
So, like, for the
Schrodinger equation,

00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:56.100
people almost always do
it with basis set methods.

00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:58.320
And there's been a huge
effort, over decades,

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:00.930
to figure out really
clever basis sets that

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:02.940
are really close to
the real solutions,

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:06.300
so that you don't need to use
too many basis functions to get

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:07.590
the good solution.

00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:09.881
So that's the way to keep
the number of variables down.

00:12:12.054 --> 00:12:15.060
In the Navier-Stokes
world, I'll show you

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:17.010
what people do to try
to deal with that.

00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:20.959
There's many other problems.

00:12:20.959 --> 00:12:22.750
I don't know all the
problems in the world.

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:26.490
But in general, when you
have three or more dimensions

00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:30.004
in your PDE system, you're
looking up special tricks.

00:12:30.004 --> 00:12:31.920
You're looking up, how
do people in this field

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:33.840
deal with this particular PDE?

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:36.400
Special ways that are
good for that kind of PDE.

00:12:39.265 --> 00:12:40.640
All right, so I
said, one problem

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:42.848
was that you could have,
that the PDE system, itself,

00:12:42.848 --> 00:12:44.250
can be intrinsically unstable.

00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:48.440
So one example I know like
that is, detonation problems.

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:52.820
So if I have a system that
has some explosive in it,

00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:55.130
or a mixture of hydrogen
and oxygen even,

00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:59.720
and I have it in a
tube or something,

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:01.137
if I change my
initial conditions,

00:13:01.137 --> 00:13:03.386
I can go from the case where
it's stable, that it just

00:13:03.386 --> 00:13:05.100
sits there, a
hydrogen and oxygen.

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:08.239
Or it could turn into
a regular burning.

00:13:08.239 --> 00:13:10.530
Or if I change the conditions
a little bit differently,

00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:12.470
it could change into a
detonation, where it actually

00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:14.100
sends a shockwave
down the tube faster

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:16.917
than the speed of sound,
totally different situation.

00:13:16.917 --> 00:13:18.500
So those kind of
systems can be really

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:22.670
sensitive to the physical
initial conditions.

00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:25.130
A very small spark can make
a really big difference

00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:26.600
in a system like that.

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:29.660
And also, in your
numerical solution,

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:31.820
if the thing is
physically sensitive,

00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:34.134
it'll typically be sensitive
also to numerical noise.

00:13:34.134 --> 00:13:36.050
If you get numerical
noise at some point, that

00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:39.080
might be enough to kick
it over from, say, not

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:41.642
igniting at all to
having a detonation,

00:13:41.642 --> 00:13:43.350
which is a completely
different solution.

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:51.270
But another case,
like in biology,

00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:54.120
if you're trying to study
the growth of a cell culture

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:58.380
or the growth of a
tumor, as you know,

00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:02.521
if somebody has a tumor and
one of the cancer cells mutates

00:14:02.521 --> 00:14:04.020
and does something
different, it can

00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:05.760
have a really different
outcome of what

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:07.920
happens to the patient,
what happens to the tumor.

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:10.210
The whole morphology
can change completely.

00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:11.920
Everything about it can change.

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:13.586
So that's the kind
of system, also, that

00:14:13.586 --> 00:14:16.510
can be very sensitive
to small details.

00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:18.450
A small change in one
cell, for example,

00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:20.230
could be a really
big difference.

00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:22.087
So this is not just
in combustion problems

00:14:22.087 --> 00:14:23.670
you have these kinds
of instabilities.

00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:26.087
All kinds of problems
have this kind of thing.

00:14:26.087 --> 00:14:27.920
You can have just regular
chemical reactors,

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:30.650
like in multiple steady states,
little tiny fluctuations

00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:32.960
can make it jump from one
steady state to another one.

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:34.751
That's another very
famous kind of problem.

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:40.640
There's another
class of PDEs where

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:45.830
it's stable in some sense,
but it causes a problem.

00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:48.740
We call those hyperbolic.

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:51.620
And those are like
wave equations.

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:53.120
The solutions are
propagating waves.

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:54.953
So the equations of
acoustics, the equations

00:14:54.953 --> 00:14:57.560
of electromagnetism,
are wave equations

00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:00.590
where, basically, a wave
propagates more or less

00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:03.000
without any damping.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.540
So what happens, then, is you
have some numerical noise that

00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:07.970
will make a little wavelet that
will propagate, more or less,

00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:09.080
without any damping, too.

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:11.660
And it'll keep bouncing back
and forth inside your domain

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:13.010
numerically.

00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:14.870
And if you keep introducing
numerical noise,

00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:16.916
eventually the whole thing
is just full of noise.

00:15:16.916 --> 00:15:18.290
And it doesn't
have much relation

00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:20.240
to the real physical solution.

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:23.810
So hyperbolic systems of
differential equations

00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:25.490
need special solution methods.

00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:27.994
That in the numerical
method, it's

00:15:27.994 --> 00:15:30.410
carefully trying to damp out
that kind of propagating wave

00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:32.060
that's coming from the noise.

00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:33.680
And they set them
up a special way.

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:36.221
I'm not going to talk about how
you solve them in this class,

00:15:36.221 --> 00:15:38.570
but there's a special, whole
group of solution methods

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:40.695
that people use who are
solving acoustics equations

00:15:40.695 --> 00:15:44.540
and solving
electromagnetic equations.

00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:47.219
If you get into solving
shockwave equations--

00:15:47.219 --> 00:15:49.010
I actually work for
Professor [? Besant. ?]

00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:51.517
He has, like, electrochemical
shocks in some of his systems.

00:15:51.517 --> 00:15:52.850
You have the same kind of thing.

00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:55.141
You have to use special
mathematics to correctly handle

00:15:55.141 --> 00:15:58.166
that, special numerical tricks.

00:15:58.166 --> 00:16:00.290
But we're not going to get
into that in this class.

00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:01.664
If you get into
those things, you

00:16:01.664 --> 00:16:03.760
should take the PDE class
for hyperbolic equations

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:05.130
and they'll tell you just
all about the solvers

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:07.310
for those kinds of things
and special tricks.

00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:08.976
And there's journal
papers all about it.

00:16:11.352 --> 00:16:13.060
Here, what we're going
to focus primarily

00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:14.800
on two kinds of problems:
elliptic problems

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:15.758
and parabolic problems.

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:20.260
And those problems
are ones where

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:23.230
there's some dissipation
that's very significant.

00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:26.290
And so, in an
elliptic problem, you

00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:31.750
introduce some numerical
noise and as you solve it,

00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:34.000
the numerical noise
kind of goes away.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.524
Sort of like intrinsically
stable all throughout.

00:16:36.524 --> 00:16:38.190
Now the real definition
of these things,

00:16:38.190 --> 00:16:40.350
parabolic, hyperbolic,
elliptic, has

00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:42.760
to do with flow of information.

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:48.540
So in a hyperbolic
system, information--

00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:51.090
there's regions of the domain
that you can make a change here

00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:54.460
and it doesn't make any effect
on some domain part over there.

00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:56.250
And so that causes--
because that

00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:59.860
is the real situation,
that also propagates

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:02.330
into the numerical
solution method.

00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:04.450
So for example, if I'm
modeling a shockwave that's

00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:06.460
moving faster than
the speed of sound,

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:08.319
I can introduce any
pressure fluctuation

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:10.089
I want behind the
shockwave, and it

00:17:10.089 --> 00:17:12.230
has no effect on the shockwave.

00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:14.920
Because the pressure waves
from that pressure fluctuation

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:15.760
are traveling at
the speed of sound.

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:17.410
They won't catch
up to the shock.

00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:19.786
So they will have no
effect whatsoever.

00:17:19.786 --> 00:17:21.369
So if I was judging
what was happening

00:17:21.369 --> 00:17:23.202
by looking at what's
happening in the shock,

00:17:23.202 --> 00:17:28.830
I can introduce any kind of
random noise I want back over,

00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:30.260
downstream of the
shock, I guess.

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:31.050
Yeah?

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:33.212
And it won't make any
difference at all.

00:17:33.212 --> 00:17:34.836
And so, that's part
of the reason why I

00:17:34.836 --> 00:17:37.110
need a special kind of solver.

00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:39.900
If I have elliptic
equations, every point

00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:42.090
affects every other point.

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:45.000
A famous case for that is,
like, this steady state heat

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.500
equation.

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:50.310
You have some temperature
source here, a heat source here,

00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:53.640
and you have some
coolness source over here.

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:57.585
And there's some heat flowing
from the hot to the cold.

00:17:57.585 --> 00:18:00.104
And the heat flow is
kind of slow enough

00:18:00.104 --> 00:18:02.520
that everything sort of affects
everything else, since you

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:04.890
actually have, the heat
is trying to flow by,

00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:06.660
sort of, every path.

00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:10.282
And there's some insulation
that's resisting its flow.

00:18:10.282 --> 00:18:11.740
And it has been in
the connectivity

00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:12.869
of flow a certain way.

00:18:12.869 --> 00:18:14.910
And those kinds of equations
are called elliptic.

00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:16.830
And the methods that we
use for the relaxation mesh

00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:19.246
that we showed are really good
for those kinds of methods,

00:18:19.246 --> 00:18:20.550
for those kind of problems.

00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:22.841
And then another kind of
problem that we get into a lot

00:18:22.841 --> 00:18:23.890
is like this one.

00:18:23.890 --> 00:18:25.800
This is called parabolic.

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:28.230
And typically, in the cases
we see that are parabolic,

00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:32.390
we have time as
part of the problem.

00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:34.374
Always what we
think should happen

00:18:34.374 --> 00:18:35.790
is that what happens
in the future

00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:40.170
depends on what happened in
the past, but not vice versa.

00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:45.060
So you would expect
that when you're

00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:48.662
computing what's happening
at the next time point,

00:18:48.662 --> 00:18:50.870
it's going to depend on what
happened at earlier time

00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:51.590
points.

00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:53.846
But if you try to do it
the other way around,

00:18:53.846 --> 00:18:55.220
it would be kind
of weird, right?

00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:57.011
You wouldn't expect
that what in the future

00:18:57.011 --> 00:18:59.210
really affected
stuff in the past.

00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:04.370
So it naturally leads us to
sort of pose it as an ODE IVP,

00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:05.510
or IVP kind of problem.

00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:07.844
And we know initially,
some time zero something,

00:19:07.844 --> 00:19:09.260
and we're trying
to calculate what

00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:11.660
happens at some later time.

00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:14.210
And so those kinds of
problems we call parabolic.

00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:15.700
And the methods that we're
going to talk about mostly

00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:17.908
are ones for solving parabolic
and elliptic problems.

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:24.894
And you can read, in
the middle of chapter 6,

00:19:24.894 --> 00:19:25.810
has a nice discussion.

00:19:25.810 --> 00:19:27.580
Just has the
mathematical definitions

00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:28.621
of what these things are.

00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:36.710
Now, even in a
steady state problem,

00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:39.860
the problem can have a sort
of directionality to it.

00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:42.170
So if you have a problem
that's very convective.

00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:43.820
So you have a flow in a pipe.

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:46.362
And you have a nice, fast
velocity flow down the pipe.

00:19:46.362 --> 00:19:48.320
What's happening downwind
is very much affected

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:51.750
by what happened upwind,
but not vice versa.

00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:54.710
So maybe you're doing
some reaction upwind.

00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:56.639
Say you're burning
some hydrogen.

00:19:56.639 --> 00:19:58.430
You're going to get
water vapor made upwind

00:19:58.430 --> 00:19:59.763
and it's going to flow downwind.

00:19:59.763 --> 00:20:03.440
And you're going to
have steam downwind.

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:06.117
If I squirt a little
methane in downwind,

00:20:06.117 --> 00:20:08.450
it doesn't actually do anything
to what happened upwind.

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:10.491
I still have a hydrogen
and oxygen flame up there

00:20:10.491 --> 00:20:12.260
and it's been burning
and making steam.

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:13.700
Do you see what I mean?

00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:15.470
So it has a directionality,
even though I

00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:18.011
might do it as a steady state
problem and not have time in it

00:20:18.011 --> 00:20:18.704
at all.

00:20:18.704 --> 00:20:20.870
And you've probably already
done this, where you can

00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:23.300
convert, like, a flow reactor.

00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:26.464
You can write it, sort of, as a
time thing or as a space thing.

00:20:26.464 --> 00:20:28.880
Time and space are so related
by the velocity of the flow.

00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:34.050
We'll have similar kinds
of phenomenon then.

00:20:34.050 --> 00:20:36.510
It's almost like a
parabolic time system

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:39.110
that, if the flow
is fast enough,

00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:42.480
the fusion backup, anything
moving upstream is negligible.

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:45.640
It's all moving from
upstream to downstream.

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:49.220
And so then, you'll have
the same kind of issues.

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:51.060
In fact, you may
even try to solve it

00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:54.750
by just starting it at the
upstream end and competing

00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:57.872
stuff and then propagating what
that output from that first one

00:20:57.872 --> 00:20:59.580
does to the next one
downstream, and then

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:00.538
do them, one at a time.

00:21:00.538 --> 00:21:02.130
That would be one
possible way to try

00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:05.430
to solve those kinds of problems
that are highly convective.

00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:08.572
As you slow the velocity
down, then the diffusion

00:21:08.572 --> 00:21:10.530
will start to fight the
velocity more and more.

00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:13.000
If you make the
velocity very slow,

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.030
the Peclet number very
low, then you really

00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:17.520
have to worry about things
diffusing back upstream.

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:19.410
And then it's a
different situation.

00:21:19.410 --> 00:21:23.260
And that would be more like
the elliptic problems we have.

00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:25.740
Because things downstream
would actually affect upstream,

00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:27.090
if the flow is really small.

00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:28.400
But typically for our
problems, the velocity

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:29.580
is always really high.

00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:32.434
Peclet numbers are really
large and so not much goes

00:21:32.434 --> 00:21:33.600
from downstream to upstream.

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:38.030
It's almost all
upstream to downstream.

00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:41.235
This leads to a
famous situation.

00:21:41.235 --> 00:21:50.627
If you look in the textbook
at figures 6.7, 6.8,

00:21:50.627 --> 00:21:52.085
it's kind of a very
famous problem.

00:21:54.730 --> 00:22:03.640
That if you just
do this problem.

00:22:23.619 --> 00:22:24.910
So this is just an ODE problem.

00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:32.730
So I just have convection
and diffusion, no reaction,

00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:33.900
very simple.

00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:35.070
This problem.

00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:38.100
You'd think that I could just
use my finite differences,

00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:40.540
where I would put, I could
use the center difference

00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:47.860
for here and here and change
this into this obvious looking

00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:48.360
thing.

00:23:05.669 --> 00:23:08.210
You think that that would be a
reasonable thing to do, right?

00:23:08.210 --> 00:23:09.380
And you can do
the same one here.

00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:10.004
You can write--

00:23:17.556 --> 00:23:18.930
I'm terrible with
minuses, sorry.

00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:30.900
So these, the finite
difference formulas.

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:34.640
And so, you can write
these like this.

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:36.430
This stays equal to zero.

00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:39.640
And now it's just an
algebraic problem to solve.

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:41.530
A system of equations,
you have equations

00:23:41.530 --> 00:23:43.430
like this for every value of n.

00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:46.290
And there's the mesh points.

00:23:46.290 --> 00:23:48.420
You guys have done
this before, yes?

00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:49.170
Yes.

00:23:49.170 --> 00:23:51.870
OK, so famous problem
is, if you actually

00:23:51.870 --> 00:23:57.740
try to solve it this way, unless
you make delta z really tiny,

00:23:57.740 --> 00:23:58.880
you get crazy stuff.

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:02.210
So on figure 6.7,
they actually show

00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:08.780
what happens for different
values of delta z, which

00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:11.930
is different values of what they
call the local Peclet number.

00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:18.430
So there's a thing called
local Peclet number, which is--

00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:26.090
OK?

00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:29.120
If you make the local Peclet
number too large, actually

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:30.950
anywhere bigger
than 2, and you try

00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:32.450
to solve this
equation, what you get

00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:35.210
is oscillations,
unphysical oscillations.

00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:37.800
They'll make the
phi go negative.

00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:38.310
It's crazy.

00:24:41.107 --> 00:24:43.440
It looks like the simplest
equation in the world, right?

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:47.320
It's a linear equation, so
what's the problem with this?

00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:49.250
But it doesn't work.

00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:53.590
And so, then you could think,
well, why doesn't it work?

00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:55.660
And there's, like, multiple
ways to explain this

00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:58.249
about why this doesn't work.

00:24:58.249 --> 00:25:00.040
I think that the best
way to think about it

00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:01.400
is about the information flow.

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:04.400
So if the local Peclet
number is large,

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:08.650
that means that phi is
just flowing downwind

00:25:08.650 --> 00:25:10.660
and diffusion is not doing much.

00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:12.920
Because the Peclet
number is big.

00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:18.140
And so, you really
shouldn't use this formula

00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:19.970
to calculate the flow.

00:25:19.970 --> 00:25:24.769
Because what happens downwind,
at point n plus one, I guess.

00:25:24.769 --> 00:25:26.060
Here we have the flow this way.

00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:32.520
So here's n minus one.

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:34.770
Here's my point n, n plus 1.

00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:42.280
I really should not
include, is this right,

00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:44.991
n plus 1 in this formula.

00:25:44.991 --> 00:25:46.240
Hope I have those signs right.

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:49.266
I apologize if I
had them backwards.

00:25:49.266 --> 00:25:50.890
Because I don't think
that what happens

00:25:50.890 --> 00:25:54.320
downstream should really
affect this at all.

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:57.070
So really, I would do better
to change from this center

00:25:57.070 --> 00:26:01.910
difference formula to what's
called the upwind difference

00:26:01.910 --> 00:26:02.410
formula.

00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:10.930
Where they would
say, OK, instead,

00:26:10.930 --> 00:26:23.810
let's use phi of n minus, the
phi of n minus 1 over delta z.

00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:27.346
Just use that instead
of using this formula.

00:26:27.346 --> 00:26:28.720
Now, you wouldn't
think that that

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:30.742
would make much difference.

00:26:30.742 --> 00:26:32.200
But it makes a
gigantic difference.

00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:35.290
And so if you look at
figure 6.8 in the textbook,

00:26:35.290 --> 00:26:40.180
you see you get perfectly stable
solutions when you do that.

00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:41.740
But where you do
this one, you get

00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:43.480
crazy, oscillatory,
unphysical solutions,

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:47.030
unless you choose
delta z really tiny.

00:26:47.030 --> 00:26:50.487
Now, there's other
ways to look at this.

00:26:50.487 --> 00:26:52.320
So I think this is the
correct way, the best

00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:55.210
way to think about it is, it
has to do with information flow.

00:26:55.210 --> 00:26:57.210
If you try to make your
solution depend on stuff

00:26:57.210 --> 00:26:58.666
that it doesn't
really depend on.

00:26:58.666 --> 00:27:00.540
So upwind does not really
depend on downwind.

00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:03.360
If you force it to,
by choosing to include

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:07.050
that information here, you
end up with crazy stuff.

00:27:07.050 --> 00:27:09.610
So that's one way to look at it.

00:27:09.610 --> 00:27:12.000
Another way to look at
it is that, if you really

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.260
want to compute
these derivatives,

00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:15.960
you've got to keep
delta z small.

00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:17.640
Because we're taking
a differential.

00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:20.010
We're turning it into
a finite difference.

00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:22.640
And if you take your
delta z too big,

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:27.680
then it's a terrible
approximation to do this.

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:28.639
And you can look at it.

00:27:28.639 --> 00:27:30.013
You can see that
what we're doing

00:27:30.013 --> 00:27:32.219
is, when we have this problem
where the local Peclet

00:27:32.219 --> 00:27:34.510
number is getting too large,
is we're actually choosing

00:27:34.510 --> 00:27:35.885
delta z bigger
than the, sort of,

00:27:35.885 --> 00:27:38.340
the thickness of the solution.

00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:41.270
So if you look at the solution,
the analytical solution

00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:44.590
of this problem, it's like this.

00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:54.930
Where this has a very,
very thin layer at the end.

00:27:54.930 --> 00:27:58.720
It's like the flow has pushed
all your stuff to one side.

00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:03.520
And if you choose your delta
z to be from here to here,

00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:05.530
that's how big your delta
z is, and then you're

00:28:05.530 --> 00:28:11.680
computing the derivative of this
point halfway along from here

00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:13.395
to where this is.

00:28:13.395 --> 00:28:15.180
You compute your
derivative like that.

00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:18.520
It's not a very good, not a very
accurate representation of what

00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:19.912
the real derivative is here.

00:28:19.912 --> 00:28:21.370
And in fact, you
really should have

00:28:21.370 --> 00:28:23.411
a bunch of points here
and here and here and here

00:28:23.411 --> 00:28:26.789
and here to really
resolve the sharp edge.

00:28:26.789 --> 00:28:28.330
And so you did
something really crazy

00:28:28.330 --> 00:28:31.260
to use a big value of
delta z to start with.

00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:34.070
So that's another way
to look at this problem.

00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:38.062
Now, the fix, by doing
this upwind differencing,

00:28:38.062 --> 00:28:40.020
I think the best way to
look at this is saying,

00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:42.020
well, I'm just going to
make sure I only depend,

00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:45.069
I only make the equations
depend on what's upwind,

00:28:45.069 --> 00:28:46.110
with the convective term.

00:28:46.110 --> 00:28:47.850
Because there's nothing
convecting from downwind.

00:28:47.850 --> 00:28:48.930
So just leave that out.

00:28:48.930 --> 00:28:51.270
So that's a conceptual
way to think about it.

00:28:51.270 --> 00:28:53.760
Another way to think about
it, which is in the text,

00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:57.300
is that by doing this,
you're introducing

00:28:57.300 --> 00:28:59.550
another thing called
numerical diffusion, where

00:28:59.550 --> 00:29:03.120
you're actually, effectively
increasing the diffusivity.

00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:05.317
Because this is a very
poor approximation

00:29:05.317 --> 00:29:06.150
to the differential.

00:29:06.150 --> 00:29:10.300
This is a asymmetrical
finite difference formula.

00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:13.260
It's not a very good value
estimate of the derivative,

00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:15.930
if delta z is big.

00:29:15.930 --> 00:29:18.829
But you can write it out
carefully and write this out

00:29:18.829 --> 00:29:20.370
and say, oh, this
actually is sort of

00:29:20.370 --> 00:29:24.690
like this plus an
effective diffusivity

00:29:24.690 --> 00:29:27.960
chosen very carefully, so the
terms cancel out just right.

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:29.490
And it turns out,
if you look at it

00:29:29.490 --> 00:29:31.650
that way, the effective
diffusion you've

00:29:31.650 --> 00:29:34.320
added, by using this
instead of that,

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:38.920
is just enough to make
the local Peclet number,

00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:41.440
if you compute it with the
effects of this d effective,

00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:42.940
to stay less than 2.

00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:45.130
Which is what you need
as a condition to make

00:29:45.130 --> 00:29:46.130
this numerically stable.

00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:51.022
So I strongly suggest
you read that.

00:29:51.022 --> 00:29:52.730
It's only two pages
long in the textbook.

00:29:52.730 --> 00:29:53.180
It's very clear.

00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:55.638
Just read, just look at it if
you haven't seen this before.

00:30:01.347 --> 00:30:03.930
There's a similar thing and it
might be relevant to the COMSOL

00:30:03.930 --> 00:30:09.780
problem that Kristyn showed
you on Monday, is you can--

00:30:12.450 --> 00:30:17.430
In that case, there was a
region of the boundary here

00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:20.650
that had some
concentration c naught,

00:30:20.650 --> 00:30:24.790
and then there was, over here,
the concentration was zero.

00:30:24.790 --> 00:30:25.890
The boundary is zero.

00:30:25.890 --> 00:30:31.420
Here, it's some number,
17, whatever number it was.

00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:39.470
And if you think of how
to model what's going on,

00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:44.120
one way to look at it is, I
have a diffusive flux coming in

00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:48.230
from the drug patch, diffusing
the drug into the flow.

00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:52.870
And I have this big, giant
flow, flowing along here.

00:30:52.870 --> 00:31:00.900
And the flow gets slower as I
get closer to the wall because

00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:03.250
of the friction with the wall.

00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:06.290
And so if I looked
somewhere right in here,

00:31:06.290 --> 00:31:08.170
I could just draw a
little control volume,

00:31:08.170 --> 00:31:09.280
and look what's happening.

00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:11.262
I have a diffusive
flux coming in here.

00:31:11.262 --> 00:31:12.970
I don't have any drug
up here, so there's

00:31:12.970 --> 00:31:13.970
no drug coming in here.

00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:15.770
But I have drug leaving.

00:31:15.770 --> 00:31:19.950
So basically, it's coming up and
it's making a right-hand turn.

00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:21.927
And so then I could
think, well, if I

00:31:21.927 --> 00:31:23.510
was going to try to
figure out, what's

00:31:23.510 --> 00:31:26.250
the steady state concentration
of drug in there, I could say,

00:31:26.250 --> 00:31:27.120
well, there's a
certain amount of drug

00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:28.744
entering from the
diffusive flux, which

00:31:28.744 --> 00:31:30.885
would be just this times dcdy.

00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:35.741
This is the y direction.

00:31:38.970 --> 00:31:41.280
And then this part
over here would

00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:46.720
be the velocity, actually,
just times the concentration

00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:47.900
I have in here, right?

00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:52.160
So how much is flowing out.

00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:54.570
And it's probably, my units
are screwed up so there's--

00:31:54.570 --> 00:31:55.700
Well, maybe not.

00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:56.200
That's OK.

00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:57.610
Is that all right?

00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:01.725
Units are screwed up.

00:32:01.725 --> 00:32:02.850
You guys will get it right.

00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:06.946
It's probably an area.

00:32:06.946 --> 00:32:08.770
Something to do with
this size right here.

00:32:08.770 --> 00:32:09.561
This one here, too.

00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:17.570
Is that right?

00:32:17.570 --> 00:32:20.747
So you could compute
what the steady state

00:32:20.747 --> 00:32:23.330
concentration would be if it's
just coming in and flowing out.

00:32:23.330 --> 00:32:25.320
And so, this is the
finite volume view

00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:27.620
of this kind of problem.

00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:30.464
And so you can write the
equations that way, instead.

00:32:30.464 --> 00:32:32.880
And what you really care about
are what the velocity flows

00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:34.879
and the diffusive fluxes
are on these boundaries

00:32:34.879 --> 00:32:36.040
around the point.

00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:38.550
So you don't try to compute
things right at the point.

00:32:38.550 --> 00:32:39.940
You compute around it.

00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:42.200
And one way to look
at this is, we just

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:43.310
did finite differencing.

00:32:43.310 --> 00:32:45.750
We were looking at what
was happening coming in.

00:32:49.390 --> 00:32:52.160
And then, this is actually
a center difference

00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:56.360
around this interface, which is
halfway between the two points.

00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:59.450
And so actually, this
is a good approximation

00:32:59.450 --> 00:33:01.925
for the finite
volume point of view.

00:33:01.925 --> 00:33:04.090
This is all right?

00:33:04.090 --> 00:33:05.810
Now, these are
all different ways

00:33:05.810 --> 00:33:07.220
to write down the equations.

00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:10.100
All of them are
correct in the limit

00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:11.694
that delta z goes to zero.

00:33:11.694 --> 00:33:13.610
If you have an infinite
number of mesh points,

00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:15.350
all these are exactly the same.

00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:18.710
But they lead to really
different numerical properties

00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:21.360
when delta z is large.

00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:23.910
And they're all inaccurate
when delta z is large,

00:33:23.910 --> 00:33:26.390
so it's all about what
happens with the inaccuracies.

00:33:30.910 --> 00:33:35.650
Now, we can go ahead and
take any problem, even

00:33:35.650 --> 00:33:38.980
really complicated 3-D problems
or 4-D problems like this,

00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:42.164
and we can write them
with relaxation methods.

00:33:42.164 --> 00:33:43.955
And what we're basically
doing in a problem

00:33:43.955 --> 00:33:48.430
like this is turning it
into some function of y

00:33:48.430 --> 00:33:53.460
is equal to zero, where y is
the value of all the unknowns.

00:33:57.320 --> 00:34:01.230
And there's a lot of equations.

00:34:01.230 --> 00:34:04.110
So I might have 100
million equations

00:34:04.110 --> 00:34:08.130
and 100 million unknowns
that are the values,

00:34:08.130 --> 00:34:12.179
or every state variable at
every state point at all times.

00:34:12.179 --> 00:34:14.389
And I can write it down,
by finding differences,

00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:16.770
by finding elements,
by finding volumes.

00:34:16.770 --> 00:34:20.239
Any way I want, I can write
down an expression like this.

00:34:20.239 --> 00:34:21.929
And I know in the
limit, as I make

00:34:21.929 --> 00:34:24.370
the number of elements
of y go to infinity,

00:34:24.370 --> 00:34:27.567
it will actually be
the real solution.

00:34:27.567 --> 00:34:29.400
And the problem is, my
computer can't handle

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:30.870
infinite number of unknowns.

00:34:30.870 --> 00:34:32.536
In fact, it's even
going to have trouble

00:34:32.536 --> 00:34:33.719
with a 100 million unknowns.

00:34:33.719 --> 00:34:35.622
And so, I have to
figure out what to do.

00:34:35.622 --> 00:34:37.080
So how would I
solve this normally,

00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:39.570
is I would take the Jacobian
of this and I would do,

00:34:39.570 --> 00:34:42.310
I'd take an initial guess
and I'd update it and have

00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:48.889
the Jacobian times my change
from the initial guess

00:34:48.889 --> 00:34:52.424
to the equal
negative of f, right?

00:34:52.424 --> 00:34:54.090
You guys have done
this a million times.

00:34:54.090 --> 00:34:57.030
As Newton-Raphson
is how you'd find

00:34:57.030 --> 00:34:58.675
improved from an initial guess.

00:34:58.675 --> 00:35:00.300
You have to provide
some initial guess.

00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:02.110
This is actually pretty hard if
you have 100 million unknowns.

00:35:02.110 --> 00:35:05.000
You have to provide the value of
the initial guess for every one

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.300
of the 100 million.

00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:08.309
But somehow you did it.

00:35:08.309 --> 00:35:10.350
And now you want to refine
that guess and this is

00:35:10.350 --> 00:35:12.960
the formula for it.

00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:15.000
And so, you just use
backslash, right?

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:19.320
But the problem here is that now
f is a 100 million long vector

00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:21.970
and this is a 100
million squared matrix.

00:35:21.970 --> 00:35:23.820
And a 100 million
squared is pretty big,

00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:26.050
10 to 16th elements in it.

00:35:26.050 --> 00:35:28.050
So I'm not going to
just write that matrix

00:35:28.050 --> 00:35:30.060
down directly like this.

00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:33.630
Now, we cleverly chose
local basis functions,

00:35:33.630 --> 00:35:37.480
so this is going to be
sparse, this Jacobian.

00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:39.950
So most of the numbers, are
those 10 to the 16th numbers

00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:41.942
in this matrix are zero.

00:35:41.942 --> 00:35:43.400
So we don't have
to represent them.

00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:45.370
But there still
might be quite a few.

00:35:45.370 --> 00:35:47.120
Probably the diagonal
events are non-zero,

00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:49.530
so that's like 10 to the
8th of them right there.

00:35:49.530 --> 00:35:50.930
And we've got, probably,
a couple of other bands.

00:35:50.930 --> 00:35:53.390
So I don't know, might be 10
to the 9th non-zero elements

00:35:53.390 --> 00:35:56.240
inside this thing,
which is pretty nutty.

00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:58.790
And depending on how much memory
they provided in the laptop

00:35:58.790 --> 00:36:01.370
they gave you, you might
be filling up the memory

00:36:01.370 --> 00:36:02.961
already just to write down j.

00:36:02.961 --> 00:36:05.210
And certainly, if you tried
to do Gaussian elimination

00:36:05.210 --> 00:36:08.477
to solve this, you're going
to have a problem because you

00:36:08.477 --> 00:36:09.560
get what's called fill in.

00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:12.510
Do you guys remember this?

00:36:12.510 --> 00:36:14.900
Even if you start from
a very sparse Jacobian,

00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:17.360
as you run the Gaussian
elimination steps

00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:19.850
the number of non-zero entries
in the intermediate matrices

00:36:19.850 --> 00:36:21.180
gets larger and larger.

00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:22.359
Remember this?

00:36:22.359 --> 00:36:24.900
And so, even if, initially, you
can write down j and store it

00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:26.710
in your computer,
you could easily

00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:31.330
overwhelm it with the third
iteration or something.

00:36:31.330 --> 00:36:33.560
So you're not going to just
use Gaussian elimination.

00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:34.580
So what do you have to do?

00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:35.663
You want to find a method.

00:36:35.663 --> 00:36:38.518
They're called direct.

00:36:38.518 --> 00:36:43.090
Direct methods to solve
this kind of problem,

00:36:43.090 --> 00:36:44.730
in order to get your
increment, which

00:36:44.730 --> 00:36:47.260
is going to be your update, to
get a better estimate of what

00:36:47.260 --> 00:36:49.050
the solution is.

00:36:49.050 --> 00:36:51.870
And the direct methods are
ones that you don't actually

00:36:51.870 --> 00:36:53.940
store the gigantic matrix.

00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:57.260
So you're trading off
CPU time for memory.

00:36:57.260 --> 00:37:00.450
So you don't have enough memory
to store the whole thing.

00:37:00.450 --> 00:37:03.810
Which we, normally you would do
this with Gaussian elimination

00:37:03.810 --> 00:37:04.760
and huge steps.

00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:06.712
It would solve it
perfectly, right?

00:37:06.712 --> 00:37:08.670
Right, Gaussian elimination's
great, backslash.

00:37:08.670 --> 00:37:10.335
You guys have used
it a few times.

00:37:10.335 --> 00:37:11.460
It's a really nice program.

00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:12.660
It always works.

00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:14.660
It's really nice.

00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:17.160
But you're going to give up
that because you can't afford it

00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:19.260
because the memory, it's
consuming too much memory

00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:21.093
and your cheapo department
didn't buy enough

00:37:21.093 --> 00:37:23.940
RAM in your computer for you.

00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:27.540
So you're going to instead
try a direct method which

00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:37.830
is, so it's trading off
CPU time versus RAM.

00:37:37.830 --> 00:37:40.080
So you're going to reduce
how much memory you actually

00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:42.754
actively have, but you're
going to expect that it's

00:37:42.754 --> 00:37:43.920
going to cost more CPU time.

00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:45.590
Because otherwise, everybody
would do something else besides

00:37:45.590 --> 00:37:48.360
Gaussian elimination all
the time, and they don't.

00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:52.080
All right, so what's the
method we're going to use?

00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:55.260
It turns out that variance on
the conjugate gradient method

00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:56.310
turned out really well.

00:37:56.310 --> 00:38:00.510
So we mentioned this
earlier, briefly.

00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:05.920
What you do is, instead
of trying to solve this,

00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:08.140
you try to solve this.

00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:28.660
So you just try to
minimize that, right?

00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:32.310
You know at the solution
this is going to be zero.

00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:35.800
Right, jy plus [INAUDIBLE]
zero when this is solved.

00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:38.740
So you try and vary
and find the delta y

00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:42.390
that makes this go to
zero by minimizing it.

00:38:42.390 --> 00:38:44.070
And then this
method, it turns out

00:38:44.070 --> 00:38:47.640
that the conjugate gradient,
if everything works great,

00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:50.220
this is guaranteed
in n iterations

00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:53.820
to go directly to the solution
of this kind of problem.

00:38:53.820 --> 00:38:56.320
Now n is large, now, because
we have 10 to the 8th unknowns.

00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:58.190
So that's 10 to
the 8th iterations.

00:38:58.190 --> 00:38:59.330
You do anything in 10
to the 8th iterations,

00:38:59.330 --> 00:39:01.300
you're not really sure
it's really going to work.

00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:02.133
So that's a warning.

00:39:02.133 --> 00:39:05.950
But at least it should get,
even after a few iterations,

00:39:05.950 --> 00:39:10.270
you should get a smaller value
of this than you had before.

00:39:10.270 --> 00:39:11.380
And so this is the method.

00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:12.520
And what's really nice
about this method,

00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:14.470
if you look into the
details of how it works,

00:39:14.470 --> 00:39:17.740
it never has to store any
intermediate matrices.

00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:20.650
So all it needs
is the capability

00:39:20.650 --> 00:39:24.730
to multiply your matrix
times some vector.

00:39:24.730 --> 00:39:29.970
And from that multiplication,
it figures out a step direction.

00:39:29.970 --> 00:39:33.370
That's the trick of this method.

00:39:33.370 --> 00:39:36.422
And because it only has to
do a forward multiplication,

00:39:36.422 --> 00:39:37.880
you don't have to
actually store j.

00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:40.171
You can just compute elements
of j, as needed, in order

00:39:40.171 --> 00:39:43.240
to evaluate this top product.

00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:46.730
This j times v. And you
don't have to ever store

00:39:46.730 --> 00:39:48.390
the whole j at once.

00:39:48.390 --> 00:39:50.620
So it's really great for
RAM to do this method.

00:39:53.330 --> 00:39:56.350
Now, as I said, when you do
10 to the 8th iterations,

00:39:56.350 --> 00:39:58.400
things don't always
work out so well.

00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:00.220
And so people have found that
when you go more than maybe

00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:01.844
10 or 20 iterations
like this, you tend

00:40:01.844 --> 00:40:04.300
to pick up numerical problems.

00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:06.527
And so, they've worked
out better methods.

00:40:06.527 --> 00:40:08.860
And there's one that people
use a lot for these problems

00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:12.820
called bi cg stab.

00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:16.800
Which is biconjugate
gradient stabilized.

00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:19.540
The applied mathematicians
went crazy trying to figure out

00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:20.617
better methods like this.

00:40:20.617 --> 00:40:22.450
And this is the one
that, I think currently,

00:40:22.450 --> 00:40:23.570
people think is the best.

00:40:23.570 --> 00:40:25.040
Though probably, there's
a lot of research on this,

00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:26.623
so maybe there's
even better ones now.

00:40:26.623 --> 00:40:29.870
But inside Matlab, I think
this is the best on they have.

00:40:29.870 --> 00:40:34.770
And this is a method
for doing this.

00:40:34.770 --> 00:40:35.830
Now, it's iterative.

00:40:35.830 --> 00:40:37.371
Now, let's remember
what we're doing.

00:40:37.371 --> 00:40:38.910
We're trying to
solve this problem.

00:40:38.910 --> 00:40:39.910
We started with a guess.

00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:42.535
We're going to break it up into
an iterative problem like this,

00:40:42.535 --> 00:40:44.520
where we're going to
do some steps, delta y.

00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:47.910
This is now doing
iterative procedure

00:40:47.910 --> 00:40:49.710
in order to compute delta y.

00:40:49.710 --> 00:40:52.470
So we have an interim procedure
and another iterative procedure

00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:54.499
inside the first
iterative procedure.

00:40:54.499 --> 00:40:56.290
So this is going to be
a lot more CPU time.

00:40:56.290 --> 00:40:57.940
So just to warn you.

00:41:01.024 --> 00:41:02.440
And it's also,
it's not guaranteed

00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:04.356
like Gaussian elimination,
to beautifully come

00:41:04.356 --> 00:41:06.097
to machine precision solution.

00:41:06.097 --> 00:41:07.430
It's going to get you something.

00:41:10.282 --> 00:41:11.740
But anyway, this
is what people do.

00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:15.760
So that's one good thing to try.

00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:20.860
Now, this whole approach is
sort of based on Newton-Raphson.

00:41:20.860 --> 00:41:24.310
We know that doesn't have the
greatest radius of convergence.

00:41:24.310 --> 00:41:28.520
So you need to provide a
pretty darn good initial guess.

00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:30.770
So how are we going to get
a good initial guess if you

00:41:30.770 --> 00:41:32.210
have a 100 million unknowns?

00:41:35.250 --> 00:41:36.410
So what methods do we know?

00:41:36.410 --> 00:41:37.826
So one idea is you
could do things

00:41:37.826 --> 00:41:40.210
like homotopy, stuff like that.

00:41:40.210 --> 00:41:42.830
If you could somehow
take your PDE system,

00:41:42.830 --> 00:41:44.300
get rid of the nonlinear terms.

00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:47.741
You're really good at solving
linear systems of PDEs.

00:41:47.741 --> 00:41:49.490
You start with that
and then you gradually

00:41:49.490 --> 00:41:51.162
turn the non-linear term on.

00:41:51.162 --> 00:41:52.370
Maybe you could coax it over.

00:41:52.370 --> 00:41:56.180
So that's one possibility, if
you're really good at PDEs.

00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:58.400
Another possibility
that I've run

00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:03.140
into a lot is the problem you're
trying to solve, for example,

00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:04.890
might be a steady state
problem like this.

00:42:04.890 --> 00:42:07.040
Where this is zero and
you try to figure out what

00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:11.900
the steady state situation is
in a flow reactor, for example.

00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:14.240
And so, it's actually,
your steady state problem

00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:17.010
came from a time
dependent problem.

00:42:17.010 --> 00:42:19.640
And if you think that your
time dependent problem really

00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:22.970
converges to the
steady state problem,

00:42:22.970 --> 00:42:24.851
sort of without much
concern about what

00:42:24.851 --> 00:42:26.350
the initial guess
is, then you could

00:42:26.350 --> 00:42:28.550
put any random initial
guess in and march it along

00:42:28.550 --> 00:42:32.300
in time enough, and
eventually, it should end up

00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:35.420
at the solution you want.

00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:36.320
So that's the idea.

00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:37.903
So that's called a
time marching idea.

00:42:37.903 --> 00:42:40.790
So there's one idea, sort
of the homotopy continuation

00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:41.420
kind of idea.

00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:44.150
That's one idea about what
to do for initial guesses.

00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:46.405
Another idea is the
time marching idea.

00:42:46.405 --> 00:42:48.530
And the key about it is,
you have to really believe

00:42:48.530 --> 00:42:50.900
that, physically,
the system does march

00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:52.510
to the steady state you want.

00:42:52.510 --> 00:42:54.440
If it does, then
this is a good idea.

00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:57.470
If it doesn't, then you're not
going to end up where you want,

00:42:57.470 --> 00:42:59.990
because it's not
going where you want.

00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:02.120
And so, you have to watch out.

00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:04.980
But in some situations, this
is true, that things work.

00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:07.220
So I do a lot of
combustion problems.

00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:11.390
A lot of these things, you
light a spark on a stove burner.

00:43:11.390 --> 00:43:13.610
No matter how you
light it, it ends up

00:43:13.610 --> 00:43:16.156
basically the same flame.

00:43:16.156 --> 00:43:17.030
So that's a good one.

00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:20.840
But I have some other ones
where I light a candle

00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:23.840
and I'm in a convective
field, a turbulent field,

00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:25.130
and it flickers.

00:43:25.130 --> 00:43:26.755
And no matter what,
it always flickers.

00:43:26.755 --> 00:43:28.588
And I never get a steady
state, so I'm never

00:43:28.588 --> 00:43:30.890
going to find a steady state
solution with that one.

00:43:30.890 --> 00:43:34.717
And so I could time
march until I retire.

00:43:34.717 --> 00:43:36.800
My computer's still burning
CPU time all that time

00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:38.980
and it'll never get to
a steady state solution.

00:43:38.980 --> 00:43:41.539
So you really have to know
what the real situation is.

00:43:41.539 --> 00:43:43.580
But if you have one where
it's going to converge,

00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:45.170
then this is a reasonable idea.

00:43:45.170 --> 00:43:48.900
Now let's talk about
the time marching.

00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:53.436
The time marching,
you have, say, dy,

00:43:53.436 --> 00:43:59.820
dt is equal to some
f of y where this

00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:03.750
is the discretized
spatial vergence.

00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:05.977
I took all the space
dimensions and replaced them

00:44:05.977 --> 00:44:07.560
with the finite
difference expressions

00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:08.820
for the derivatives.

00:44:08.820 --> 00:44:12.570
Or I did colocation or
something to convert this

00:44:12.570 --> 00:44:15.912
into algebraic equations.

00:44:15.912 --> 00:44:18.120
So the right-hand side is
now algebraic equations, no

00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:21.090
longer differentials.

00:44:21.090 --> 00:44:25.200
And now, I'm going to time
march this and I just--

00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:25.950
This is very long.

00:44:25.950 --> 00:44:28.470
It's a 100 million.

00:44:28.470 --> 00:44:30.720
So how are we going
to time march that?

00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:33.690
Well there's kind of two
schools of thought for this.

00:44:33.690 --> 00:44:38.090
One school of thought is, if
I can use an explicit method,

00:44:38.090 --> 00:44:41.220
an explicit ODE solver,
those are pretty nice.

00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:44.070
Because all I have to do
is evaluate f and then

00:44:44.070 --> 00:44:47.610
I can march along and I never
have to save any matrices.

00:44:47.610 --> 00:44:51.630
Because remember, look
at those formulas, y,

00:44:51.630 --> 00:44:56.340
y new, by the
explicit method, is

00:44:56.340 --> 00:45:00.320
equal to some
function g of y old.

00:45:04.469 --> 00:45:05.760
And this is the update formula.

00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:06.760
It can be forward Euler.

00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:08.240
It could be RK 2.

00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:09.346
It could be whatever.

00:45:09.346 --> 00:45:10.970
But there's just some
explicit formula.

00:45:10.970 --> 00:45:12.500
I plug in the old vector.

00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:13.730
I compute a new vector.

00:45:13.730 --> 00:45:18.050
I never had to do any inversions
of matrices or anything.

00:45:18.050 --> 00:45:18.980
So that's good.

00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:21.530
And this is, indeed, the
way that the Navier-Stokes

00:45:21.530 --> 00:45:25.310
equations are solved currently
by the best possible solver.

00:45:25.310 --> 00:45:30.050
So the best solver in the
world discretizes in space

00:45:30.050 --> 00:45:34.970
and then does ODE IVP
using explicit method

00:45:34.970 --> 00:45:35.899
for marching it.

00:45:35.899 --> 00:45:37.440
They do problems
that are pretty big.

00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:40.190
So they'll have like 100
million mesh points and then 100

00:45:40.190 --> 00:45:41.450
species.

00:45:41.450 --> 00:45:44.870
So they have 10 to
the 10th unknowns.

00:45:44.870 --> 00:45:47.120
And at each time step, you're
computing another vector

00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:49.310
that's 10 to the 10th long.

00:45:49.310 --> 00:45:51.270
So it's a pretty big problem.

00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:55.460
And they use, like, 40% of one
of the national supercomputer

00:45:55.460 --> 00:45:58.310
centers will be running at one
time for one job like this.

00:45:58.310 --> 00:45:59.701
But it works.

00:45:59.701 --> 00:46:01.700
You never have to store
anything that's too big.

00:46:01.700 --> 00:46:04.070
The biggest thing you have
to store are the vectors.

00:46:04.070 --> 00:46:05.030
Which, you're
always going to have

00:46:05.030 --> 00:46:06.988
to store some object the
size of your solution,

00:46:06.988 --> 00:46:09.230
right, if you're going
to get your solution.

00:46:09.230 --> 00:46:10.880
So that's one possibility.

00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:16.240
Now, this is really good if an
explicit solver can solve it.

00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:20.510
So that means it's just
not stiff, your problem.

00:46:20.510 --> 00:46:24.140
And also, if you want a
time accurate solution.

00:46:24.140 --> 00:46:26.810
So in that case, they actually
want the time accurate

00:46:26.810 --> 00:46:27.405
solution.

00:46:27.405 --> 00:46:29.780
But suppose we're trying to
really solve the steady state

00:46:29.780 --> 00:46:31.547
problem over here.

00:46:31.547 --> 00:46:33.630
Then we really don't care
about the time accuracy.

00:46:33.630 --> 00:46:36.720
We're not going to report
anything about our time steps.

00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:38.180
In the end, we're only going
to report our steady state

00:46:38.180 --> 00:46:38.679
solution.

00:46:38.679 --> 00:46:40.044
That's all we cared about.

00:46:40.044 --> 00:46:41.460
So in that case,
there's no reason

00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:44.580
to try to have a really high
accuracy, explicit formula

00:46:44.580 --> 00:46:47.250
and try to make sure we all our
time steps are exactly right.

00:46:47.250 --> 00:46:48.780
We're just going to throw away
all those time points anyway.

00:46:48.780 --> 00:46:51.360
We'll just keep the final
one as our initial guess

00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:54.630
for a Newton-Raphson solve
to find the steady state.

00:46:54.630 --> 00:46:57.840
So in those cases, you
might instead want to use--

00:46:57.840 --> 00:46:59.850
So this is time accurate.

00:47:05.312 --> 00:47:06.270
There's another method.

00:47:06.270 --> 00:47:10.260
I don't know if I should
call it time inaccurate.

00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:14.250
If you don't care, if
the solution is really,

00:47:14.250 --> 00:47:16.320
what the solution
yft is, all you

00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:19.770
care about is where you get to,
then you can do other methods.

00:47:19.770 --> 00:47:22.230
And one of them is
the backward Euler.

00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:30.380
So you can say, well,
y new is equal to y old

00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:35.660
plus delta t times f of y new.

00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:39.150
Now, the advantage of this is,
I can make delta t pretty large.

00:47:39.150 --> 00:47:41.250
This is guaranteed
stable as long

00:47:41.250 --> 00:47:42.640
as the ODE system is stable.

00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:43.890
Remember?

00:47:43.890 --> 00:47:49.110
And so, this will go to this,
go to the solution pretty well,

00:47:49.110 --> 00:47:50.745
to the steady state solution.

00:47:50.745 --> 00:47:52.620
It won't go there in
the right amount of time

00:47:52.620 --> 00:47:54.760
because this is a very
low order of formula.

00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:57.190
It's not really accurate.

00:47:57.190 --> 00:47:59.620
But it will end up to the
real steady state solution.

00:47:59.620 --> 00:48:01.220
This is what's
actually used a lot.

00:48:01.220 --> 00:48:04.210
However, the problem
with this is, this is now

00:48:04.210 --> 00:48:07.530
an implicit equation.

00:48:07.530 --> 00:48:09.810
So we may have to solve
it with some method

00:48:09.810 --> 00:48:11.904
like Newton-Raphson.

00:48:11.904 --> 00:48:13.570
But we got into this
because we couldn't

00:48:13.570 --> 00:48:15.569
solve our Newton-Raphson
steps because we didn't

00:48:15.569 --> 00:48:17.230
have a good initial guess.

00:48:17.230 --> 00:48:19.890
So then the question is, can
we find a good initial guess

00:48:19.890 --> 00:48:21.839
for this problem?

00:48:21.839 --> 00:48:23.380
And in this case,
you can because you

00:48:23.380 --> 00:48:27.970
can use the explicit formulas to
again provide the initial guess

00:48:27.970 --> 00:48:30.110
for this implicit formula.

00:48:30.110 --> 00:48:33.220
So that's what they do, also.

00:48:33.220 --> 00:48:36.204
And so now, if we're doing an
iterative procedure in order

00:48:36.204 --> 00:48:38.620
to get the initial guess for
our other iterative procedure

00:48:38.620 --> 00:48:40.090
ever there, which
we're going to break up

00:48:40.090 --> 00:48:42.715
into another iterative procedure
inside it to solve every step.

00:48:45.910 --> 00:48:47.860
But this is currently
what people do.

00:48:47.860 --> 00:48:49.360
So you guys are smart.

00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:51.610
Maybe you can figure
a better way to do it.

00:48:51.610 --> 00:48:54.360
The world is waiting.

00:48:54.360 --> 00:48:55.360
I think I'll stop there.

00:48:57.880 --> 00:48:59.890
By the way, actually
just names--

00:48:59.890 --> 00:49:02.980
This kind of thing is
called method of lines.

00:49:07.350 --> 00:49:09.630
And if so, if anybody ever
says I solved something

00:49:09.630 --> 00:49:12.060
by method of lines,
what they meant was,

00:49:12.060 --> 00:49:14.389
they discretized in
some of the coordinates

00:49:14.389 --> 00:49:16.680
and they kept one of the
coordinates as a differential.

00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:20.660
And then they solved it with
an ODE solver at the end.

00:49:20.660 --> 00:49:23.630
And in certain systems like
this, it's a smart thing to do.

00:49:23.630 --> 00:49:26.240
You need to be kind of lucky
that the set up is right,

00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:27.900
so you can use it.

00:49:27.900 --> 00:49:29.960
But if you can, it
can be pretty good.

00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:31.290
All right.

00:49:31.290 --> 00:49:33.190
See you on Friday.
