00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:27.120
PROFESSOR: All right,
let's get started.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.190
So today we're going to talk
about boundary value problems.

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:34.295
But I want to try to start
back with a motivating example.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.030
So unfortunately, like
most technologies,

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.540
the biggest driver for
differential equation solutions

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.890
was from military technology.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.987
And the military problem--

00:00:51.987 --> 00:00:53.070
I'll tell you in a second.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.080
Let me first remind you.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.325
So we have ODE-IVPs.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:21.010
And they are-- right.

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.610
So that's the ODE-IVP is we
have n differential equations,

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.186
and we have n
initial conditions.

00:01:28.186 --> 00:01:29.935
And you guys are really
good at these now.

00:01:29.935 --> 00:01:30.955
Had a lot of practice.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.240
But you can have problems
where some of the conditions

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.830
are not specified at the t0.

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:43.340
They are specified
somewhere else.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.220
So if all of them are specified
at t0, we call it an IVP.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:55.840
And we call it a BVP is if
the conditions are like this.

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.057
This is not so good.

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:11.610
And not all the
tm's are the same.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.700
If all the tm's are the
same, we call it t0,

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:15.960
and we're back to IVP.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:21.630
So IVP is like a special
case of the ODE-BVP problem.

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.280
And here I'm ranking them as
if everything is explicit.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.210
So we know an explicit
equation for dy dt.

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.540
We have an explicit equation
for the boundary conditions.

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.590
In fact, often, we actually
only have implicit equations.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.595
So I'll show you an
example in a minute.

00:02:37.595 --> 00:02:38.730
But that's it.

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:44.520
And we still need
to have n equations.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.810
Well, I guess I could do this.

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.100
Take this back.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.970
Basic goals, and just
be just be careful.

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.152
These ends are-- it's
the same number of them.

00:02:53.152 --> 00:02:54.610
It's the same number
of conditions.

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.550
This is OK to write it this
way, but just be careful.

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.090
Is that OK?

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.430
Just to make it confusing.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:04.500
All right.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.067
I guess I can call this 0 now.

00:03:06.067 --> 00:03:07.650
See, but now it's
not really 0, right?

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.412
It's really maybe-- call
it star at the boundary.

00:03:11.412 --> 00:03:13.370
There's some special
value-- some special place

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.300
where you know the value of y.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.620
All right.

00:03:21.382 --> 00:03:23.090
So let's do the
motivating example, which

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.420
comes from military technology.

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.600
And this is quite
an old problem.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.040
So, because, in the
old days, people

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.296
didn't have motor vehicles,
and, basically, the roads

00:03:33.296 --> 00:03:35.170
were no good, and there
were a lot of bandits

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.620
out on the roads, people
liked to ship everything

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.390
by water transportation.

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.550
And so all the towns
grew up on rivers,

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.370
or on ports on the ocean.

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.130
And so, if you lived
in a nice little town,

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.090
you know, up in the
hills there, and then,

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.470
at the base of the hills, you
have your cute little town.

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:57.860
You have your house.

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:02.080
You have some warehouses where
you keep all your nice goods.

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:08.620
You have a dock that
goes out onto the water.

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.249
Here's the land.

00:04:10.249 --> 00:04:12.290
Here, these nice ships
come and park at the dock.

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:13.850
They unload nice goods.

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:15.380
You trade your stuff to them.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.045
You make a lot of money.

00:04:17.045 --> 00:04:19.670
Everyone's happy and prosperous
and having a great time living.

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:21.290
This is a port city.

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:27.080
But then you look out on
the horizon in the water,

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.892
and you see a ship is coming.

00:04:28.892 --> 00:04:30.350
And sometimes that
a ship is coming

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:31.516
is really good news for you.

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.915
But sometimes the ship coming
is not good because on the back,

00:04:37.915 --> 00:04:49.300
it has a flag, and on the flag,
you see skull and crossbones.

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.940
And you realize it's
a pirate ship coming.

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.499
And now you're in
serious trouble

00:04:54.499 --> 00:04:56.540
because you really don't
want the pirates to come

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:58.580
to your nice little
town because who

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.140
knows what they'll do there.

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.000
But it won't be good.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.170
All right, so the people
who live in this town,

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:06.950
after this has happened
to you a few times,

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:09.260
you're really alarmed,
and you're really happy,

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:10.570
and you don't want to
rebuild your town again

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:11.960
because it just got
burned down the last time

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.293
and the pirate came and
pillaged it and took everything.

00:05:14.293 --> 00:05:16.520
And you guys all had to
run away into the hills.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.820
So instead, they've invented
cannons or catapults, put

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.790
one of the cannons, say,
at the top of the hill

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:24.079
above your town.

00:05:24.079 --> 00:05:26.120
And then you say, the next
time the pirates come,

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.640
I'm ready for them.

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.210
So drawing the cannon.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:37.370
And so the question is, you want
to shoot the cannonball so it

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:40.160
hit the pirate ship
at the waterline,

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:44.740
when the pirate is
distance L from the shore--

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.537
hopefully, pretty
far, so they're

00:05:46.537 --> 00:05:47.870
not going to shoot at you first.

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:49.150
And you're shooting from
up at the top of the hill,

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.160
so you can shoot
further than they can.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.270
So you're going to shoot
distance L. And you're

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:57.400
shooting from an
elevation H. And you

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.042
want to make sure your
cannonball hits them, ideally,

00:06:00.042 --> 00:06:01.000
right at the waterline.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.960
Boom, makes a nice hole in
their ship, and it sinks.

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.120
So that's the plan.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.360
Now the problem is,
getting the cannonball

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.870
to go from here to
there is not so easy.

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:16.980
It's a big ocean.

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:18.140
There's a lot of places
your cannonballs can

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:19.681
fall into the ocean,
and it might not

00:06:19.681 --> 00:06:21.060
be where the pirate ship is.

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:24.690
And reloading canon
is pretty slow.

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:26.440
And you guys live in
this prosperous port.

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:27.940
You're not military
guys, and so you

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:29.960
don't have that much
practice doing it anyway.

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.710
And you're cheap because
you're merchants.

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:32.910
And you don't want to
spend your money buying

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:34.205
lots of cannonballs anyway.

00:06:34.205 --> 00:06:36.080
So you only get a few
of cannonballs up here.

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.304
And there's a little pile of
cannonballs next to the cannon.

00:06:39.304 --> 00:06:41.220
And then, when you see
the pirate ship coming,

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:43.230
you guys run up the
hill quick, and you

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:45.190
get to take a couple of
shots, and that's it.

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:47.700
And if you hit them,
then your town is safe,

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:50.550
and, otherwise, everything you
love and know in your world

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:53.490
is going to be destroyed
by the pirates.

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:55.020
OK?

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:56.880
So this was the
motivating sample

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:59.630
for that element of
differential equation solvers.

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:00.130
OK?

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.886
So let's see if we can write
down the equations that

00:07:06.886 --> 00:07:08.010
correspond to this example.

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:13.990
So it's going to
be Newton's laws.

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:18.520
F equals ma on the
cannonball as it travels.

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:25.600
So we can write that also as
equals-- well what's the F?

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:35.238
F is going to be negative
mg in the z direction.

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:40.270
That's gravity pulling
the cannonball down.

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:43.750
And then you'll have some air
friction on the cannonball.

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:46.260
And I'm going to call the air
friction coefficient gamma m

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:53.160
times v. OK?

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:55.140
So that's the simplest
model for what

00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:57.610
the forces are on a cannonball
just flying from my cannon,

00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:00.080
hopefully, to hit
the pirate ship.

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:07.085
And I can rearrange us
by dividing through by m.

00:08:07.085 --> 00:08:14.500
And acceleration is velocity,
so dv dt is equal to negative g.

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:16.580
So you have negative gamma--

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:22.330
sorry.

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:23.946
My notation is not so good.

00:08:23.946 --> 00:08:24.446
OK.

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.300
Everyone is all right with this?

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:30.050
Yeah.

00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:34.410
So then we can write the whole
differential equation system,

00:08:34.410 --> 00:08:49.720
d dt of xz vx vz equals
dx dt is vx, dz dt is vz.

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:53.810
dvx dt is negative gamma vx.

00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:02.740
dvz dt is negative
g minus gamma v ez.

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:08.635
So that's a fine ODE system.

00:09:08.635 --> 00:09:09.760
It's not too hard to solve.

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:10.635
It's actually linear.

00:09:10.635 --> 00:09:12.157
It's a piece of cake, right?

00:09:12.157 --> 00:09:13.990
You guys just probably
just did this already

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:16.448
when you were in high school,
or college, anyway, for sure.

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:24.230
And let's write down
the initial conditions.

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:30.760
So we know x0 is equal to 0.

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:38.290
z of 0 is equal to h,
the height of the canon.

00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:41.340
vx of 0, oh, what's
that equal to?

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:44.200
We don't know. vz of 0,
we don't know that either.

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:51.200
But we bought this canon with
a certified muzzle velocity v0,

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:54.410
so we actually know
that vx of 0 squared

00:09:54.410 --> 00:10:01.760
plus the vz of 0 squared
is equal to v0 squared--

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:04.610
whereas, when I
bought the canon,

00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:06.800
the merchants went out
to the local canon dealer

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:08.630
and bought a canon,
and the guy said,

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:09.710
you put this much
gunpowder in it,

00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:11.168
you'll get a muzzle
velocity of v0.

00:10:11.168 --> 00:10:13.430
So they know that
that number is.

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:15.520
So we have a condition
that's not really the way

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:16.680
we expect it to be.

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:18.180
And we don't have
enough conditions.

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:19.720
We need four conditions.

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:21.610
But of course, the most
important condition

00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:28.150
is what happens at L. We really
want to know that x of t final

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:33.635
is equal to L and y of t final
is equal to 0 at sea level.

00:10:33.635 --> 00:10:35.260
So that way, our
cannonball is going to

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:38.260
into the right
location at t final.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:42.510
So we have two
conditions specified way,

00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:45.610
way away from where we are.

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:47.794
And we have two conditions
specified initially.

00:10:47.794 --> 00:10:49.210
And no you have
some oddball thing

00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:53.600
in here, some oddball
fifth condition.

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.070
Now, OK.

00:10:58.297 --> 00:10:59.880
One problem here is,
we don't actually

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:02.422
know what t final is
because before we shoot it,

00:11:02.422 --> 00:11:04.630
we really don't know how
long it takes the cannonball

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:06.250
to get out there.

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:07.990
So this is a kind
of weird condition

00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:09.775
where t final is unknown,
whereas, the ones you've

00:11:09.775 --> 00:11:11.816
done before, I think you've
always known t final.

00:11:11.816 --> 00:11:13.020
Is that right?

00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:14.871
So let's talk about
how to deal with that.

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:19.770
So one problem, one
way to deal with this

00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:24.020
is to notice that, if we have
an equation system dy dt equals

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:30.172
f of y, we could change
variables instead of using t.

00:11:30.172 --> 00:11:32.630
Since we really don't know much
about time in this problem,

00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:34.890
t is not the best
variable for us.

00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:37.910
So we want to change it
to some new variable u.

00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:41.790
So suppose that we
want to change to u.

00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:48.254
And, if we change to u,
we can write something

00:11:48.254 --> 00:11:56.900
like this-- dy du
du dt equals f of y.

00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:58.340
Can you see that?

00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:00.530
So I can try to get the
differentials in terms of u,

00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:02.677
and I just have to
know what my du dt is.

00:12:02.677 --> 00:12:04.760
And you guys might have
even changed the variables

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:07.330
before, in calculus sometime,
you probably did this--

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:10.880
a long time ago, and chain
rule, and stuff like that.

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:15.500
All right, so we can sort of
pick whatever idea we want,

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:17.742
and as long as we put in
the du dt in the equation,

00:12:17.742 --> 00:12:18.450
then we'll be OK.

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:26.330
So let's just choose that u is
equal to x because we know du

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:28.420
dt would then be with the vx.

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:36.850
So we could we could
write this out this way.

00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:38.890
We could write d--

00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:40.860
I'll keep it as u for a
minute, so the notation

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:42.490
won't be so confusing.

00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:53.350
So du dt, dy du is equal
to f of y over du dt.

00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:56.560
And as long as du dt is
never zero, we're good.

00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:00.370
So we could any u we want
as long du dt is never zero.

00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:03.670
Then we're still going to have
a nice simple question here.

00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:08.620
And so I'm going to choose u is
equal to x because du dt is vx.

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:10.090
And I know that
vx is never zero.

00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:13.690
They're kind of also
always moving to the right.

00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:15.190
So I'm going to
divide by something.

00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:16.780
It's never zero.

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:19.060
So I can write it this way--

00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:22.700
dy du is equal to--

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:25.281
I can go down that list and
divide each of these things

00:13:25.281 --> 00:13:25.780
by vx.

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:38.790
So it's 1, vz over vx,
negative gamma, negative g

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:47.160
over vx minus gamma vz over vx.

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:50.690
That's my new [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:51.190
OK?

00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:57.762
OK with this?

00:13:57.762 --> 00:13:58.670
How about energetic?

00:13:58.670 --> 00:13:59.030
Keep nodding.

00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:00.530
Yeah, yeah, sure,
keep going faster.

00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:01.580
It's going way too slow.

00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:02.850
That's what I want you to say.

00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:04.886
Yeah?

00:14:04.886 --> 00:14:05.510
Apparently not.

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:06.540
OK.

00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:07.040
All right.

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:15.020
So the advantage
to changing here

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:17.690
is that now I can write the
initial conditions, and all

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:23.050
these conditions, in
terms of u, which is x.

00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:28.030
So I really-- I want to go
from u is equal to 0, i.e.

00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:35.100
X is equals to 0, to u is equal
to L, which is x equal to L.

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:37.680
So now, I could also
look at this say,

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:41.160
this is kind of stupid. dy
du, the first component of y

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:43.620
is dy du is equal to one.

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:45.390
And that first
component of y never

00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:48.040
appears in the rest
of these equations.

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:50.580
So that's kind of not
a very useful one.

00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:55.530
So I can change, and I could
write a simpler equation,

00:14:55.530 --> 00:15:07.300
dy tilde du is equal to vz over
vx negative gamma, negative g

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:15.430
over vx minus gamma
vz over vx, where

00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:21.130
my y tilde is just equal to
the last three variables--

00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:25.521
z, vx, vz.

00:15:30.492 --> 00:15:32.200
So I did a lot of
algebra, but I ended up

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:33.575
simplifying my
life because now I

00:15:33.575 --> 00:15:37.250
have three different equations
to solve instead of four.

00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:44.410
And I can write
that y tilde of zero

00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:48.390
of the first element of y tilde,
which is z, is equals to h.

00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:51.270
So that's a condition
I know for sure.

00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:53.580
And I know that I really
want this cannonball

00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:56.070
to hit the pirate ship.

00:15:56.070 --> 00:16:04.550
So I want y1 tilde of L to
be 0, so I want tilde as z.

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:09.460
And I want z to be 0
when x is equal to L.

00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:11.960
Or that's the point where the
cannonball is hitting the ship

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:13.090
at the water line there.

00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:19.010
So those are definitely
two conditions I have.

00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:22.120
And then I need a
third condition.

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:24.390
And my third condition is
this crazy equation here.

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:34.260
All right, so now I
have three conditions

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.990
for three differential
equations, and one of them

00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:38.910
is an oddball looking thing.

00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:40.160
These two look kind of normal.

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:42.020
However, this one is
a t0, and this one

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:44.805
is some goofball value, but
at least I know the value.

00:16:44.805 --> 00:16:46.430
I know what L is
because I know how far

00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:47.429
away the pirate ship is.

00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:50.980
So far so good?

00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:55.190
All right.

00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:57.670
But how am I going
to solve this?

00:16:57.670 --> 00:17:00.610
So how do we know how to solve
differential equations right

00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:04.270
now is we know how to do
initial value problems.

00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:06.740
We have these nice
programs like ode45

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:09.219
that work great, integrate
differential equations.

00:17:09.219 --> 00:17:11.510
So we should be able to use
that somehow to solve this.

00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:13.540
But we don't have all
the inputs because ode45

00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:16.940
would expect us to give
values of all three of the y

00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:19.569
tilde values at 0.

00:17:19.569 --> 00:17:20.569
I only know one of them.

00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:25.380
So how can I approach it?

00:17:28.627 --> 00:17:30.460
Sorry, I'm going to put
my beautiful drawing

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:31.126
down below here.

00:17:33.129 --> 00:17:35.170
We'll save it for posterity
and look at it later.

00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:42.860
So I could approach
it by saying, well,

00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:46.780
I don't know what these two
initial conditions would be,

00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:50.970
what vx and vz should be at 0.

00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:52.780
I'll treat them as unknowns.

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:54.488
I want to figure out
what they should be.

00:17:56.700 --> 00:18:00.890
And so, I'm going to
vary those unknowns

00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:03.530
and then, for each
value I choose,

00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:07.010
then I can shoot the cannon
with those v's, and I

00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:08.861
can see where the
cannonball went,

00:18:08.861 --> 00:18:10.610
and if it didn't go
to the right location,

00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:14.620
I can readjust those
v's and then try again.

00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:16.370
Just like, if you were
running the cannon,

00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:18.467
you might shoot at
a certain angle,

00:18:18.467 --> 00:18:21.050
and then adjust the angle of the
cannon, and then shoot again.

00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:22.549
And then, when you
change the angle,

00:18:22.549 --> 00:18:26.120
you change the ratio of
vx to vy initially, right?

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:28.320
So that's called the
shooting method--

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:30.670
for good reason.

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:32.650
So the shooting method,
that's what we do.

00:18:32.650 --> 00:18:51.940
We guess the missing
initial conditions,

00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:57.270
then you solve using the guess.

00:18:57.270 --> 00:19:02.450
You solve the ODE-IVP problem.

00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:12.260
And then you see
what it computes.

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:14.960
And if the solution
you get doesn't

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:17.114
satisfy the
conditions you demand,

00:19:17.114 --> 00:19:18.530
you go back and
adjust your guess.

00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:26.749
And you loop around.

00:19:26.749 --> 00:19:27.540
So that's the idea.

00:19:30.130 --> 00:19:31.720
Now, this thing
of adjusting some

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:34.960
parameter values, some
initial conditions,

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:37.570
to try to satisfy
some condition, that's

00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:39.010
like an f solve problem.

00:19:39.010 --> 00:19:44.360
That's a system of nonlinear
equations kind of problem.

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:48.670
So we're going to have f
solve as the outside loop,

00:19:48.670 --> 00:19:51.354
and that's going to
adjust some parameters.

00:19:51.354 --> 00:19:52.520
And then, what's f solve do?

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:56.846
So f solve tries to solve
problems of the form g of--

00:19:56.846 --> 00:19:59.296
I usually write x, but
I'll call it v here.

00:19:59.296 --> 00:19:59.796
No.

00:19:59.796 --> 00:20:00.220
V's not good either.

00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:02.036
What letter have we
have not used yet?

00:20:02.036 --> 00:20:03.450
Any letter.

00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:04.420
g of w.

00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:05.650
There we go.

00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:08.020
g of w equals 0.

00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:10.280
I want to figure out
what w's I need to use.

00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:16.700
And actually, v is right.

00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:19.100
Because we're trying to
adjust the velocities, right?

00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:20.550
Sorry, I'm messing up here.

00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:22.370
It's good to use the
eraser in this class--

00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:25.130
especially with this
nice big eraser.

00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:27.640
All right, so g of e--

00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:30.960
we're trying to adjust the
velocities to make something 0.

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:32.910
So what's our g that we want?

00:20:32.910 --> 00:20:41.120
We really want that
the z value at L--

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:44.840
we want that to be equal to 0.

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:47.535
And this thing is, like,
implicitly a function

00:20:47.535 --> 00:20:48.035
of the v's--

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:53.390
the v0 values we give.

00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:58.520
If you put the right v0 values
in, then z at L would be 0.

00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:00.680
So this is what we're
really trying to solve.

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:04.280
Now, to get z of L, we have to
solve a system of differential

00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:05.820
equations.

00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:08.520
So it's a little complicated
to go from v0 to zL,

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:11.090
but we can do because
we have ode45.

00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:17.125
So we can write a
function to do this.

00:21:17.125 --> 00:21:18.000
Running out of words.

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:38.020
All right so let's try
to write the program.

00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:46.740
So we want to write
the program g.

00:21:46.740 --> 00:22:12.010
So we want to write z of
L is equal to g of v0.

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:19.830
And let's try to think
what this function is.

00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:24.330
So the meat of this is, we
have to solve a differential

00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:25.890
equation, an IVP.

00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:27.390
So somewhere, we
have an ode45 call.

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:32.055
And what does ode45 computing?

00:22:32.055 --> 00:22:39.450
It's computing the x
positions and the z positions.

00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:52.670
And it's going to use some
function f, which was--

00:22:52.670 --> 00:22:54.920
do we still have
it on the board?

00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:55.830
Maybe I lost it here.

00:22:59.145 --> 00:22:59.645
Nope.

00:23:02.872 --> 00:23:03.830
Sorry, it's under here.

00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:05.860
I'm a terrible board worker.

00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:10.530
So this is our
function f, f f of y.

00:23:16.250 --> 00:23:22.870
So this is really f tilde.

00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:25.777
That's the function that
I'm going to integrate.

00:23:25.777 --> 00:23:27.610
And I can't remember
what are the arguments,

00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:30.310
but it's going to be
something like, from 0 to L,

00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:33.700
and then I have to give it
a y0, and then maybe there's

00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:35.640
some other stuff up there.

00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:38.906
All right, do you guys
remember the ode45?

00:23:38.906 --> 00:23:40.030
Is that in the right order?

00:23:40.030 --> 00:23:42.120
I don't remember.

00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:44.410
OK.

00:23:44.410 --> 00:23:48.640
So I need to specify the y0.

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:56.910
So y0 is going to be equal
to the initial value of z,

00:23:56.910 --> 00:23:58.462
the altitude.

00:23:58.462 --> 00:24:03.260
So it's going to be H. And then
it's the initial value of vx.

00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:05.290
So I don't know what
that is, but it's--

00:24:05.290 --> 00:24:07.430
maybe you just
want to call it v0.

00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:07.930
vx0.

00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:15.530
And then I do have one
more condition here,

00:24:15.530 --> 00:24:18.480
that vz is related to vx.

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:19.660
So I can use that.

00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:25.770
So I can have the last one be
the square root of v0 squared

00:24:25.770 --> 00:24:27.902
minus vx0 squared.

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:34.200
So that's the line
for what y0 is.

00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:40.360
And then I solve this.

00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:44.260
And then I write the
number of steps in the time

00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:46.260
stepping program that
did, in order to get here.

00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:48.490
It was x stepping in this case.

00:24:48.490 --> 00:24:57.670
Num steps is equal to
the length of x vec.

00:24:57.670 --> 00:25:07.010
And z of L is equal
to z vec at N step.

00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:08.177
That's it, right?

00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:18.640
So that's the function that
you would feed to f solve.

00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:20.830
And your correct
value of vx 0 is

00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:24.250
the one that makes zL 0, which
is what f solve tried to do.

00:25:24.250 --> 00:25:25.020
Yeah?

00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:35.580
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:40.170
PROFESSOR: You can, but
in the physical problem,

00:25:40.170 --> 00:25:42.064
usually cannons
always shoot upwards.

00:25:42.064 --> 00:25:43.230
So we'll just shoot upwards.

00:25:43.230 --> 00:25:46.110
But yeah, it could
be either way.

00:25:46.110 --> 00:25:47.610
Yeah, and, in fact,
in this problem,

00:25:47.610 --> 00:25:50.010
you might do better to
change-- instead of using vx0

00:25:50.010 --> 00:25:55.110
as your unknown, you might want
to change to theta, the angle,

00:25:55.110 --> 00:25:57.600
the elevation angle
of the cannon,

00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:00.452
and that would be more physical
of what the actual user

00:26:00.452 --> 00:26:01.410
of the cannon is using.

00:26:01.410 --> 00:26:03.201
They're adjusting theta,
not adjusting vx0.

00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:09.606
It's no problem, actually.

00:26:09.606 --> 00:26:11.230
From the point of
view of the f solves,

00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:13.440
you can make this theta instead.

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:18.310
And then you'd have this
be v0 times cos of theta,

00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:21.450
and this b v0 times
sine of theta,

00:26:21.450 --> 00:26:24.180
and it would work just as
well to get the solution.

00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:26.320
All right, so that's
the shooting method.

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:28.680
So this function
g is the g that's

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:33.390
going-- you'll have f
solve, so is going to say,

00:26:33.390 --> 00:26:41.700
vx0 is equal to f solve of g.

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:46.940
And then you have to
have a guess, right?

00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:49.366
For f solve.

00:26:49.366 --> 00:26:51.240
So that's how you would
invoke this function.

00:26:57.230 --> 00:27:00.670
All right, and so if
we wanted to figure

00:27:00.670 --> 00:27:02.950
operation count of
how many operations

00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:06.370
this is to find a solution
this way, how's it go?

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.300
How many iterations does it
take to solve an ODE IVP.

00:27:24.419 --> 00:27:25.960
That depends on the
step size, right?

00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:26.740
It's adaptive.

00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:29.660
Usually adaptive stepping.

00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:32.637
So you have some experience
with that, maybe 100 steps?

00:27:32.637 --> 00:27:33.470
Something like that?

00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:34.220
Is usually enough?

00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:38.750
Maybe 1,000 if it's not stiff?

00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:41.240
And then how many
iterations does it take

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:42.558
f solve to solve something?

00:27:45.426 --> 00:27:47.250
10?

00:27:47.250 --> 00:27:51.960
So you have maybe 1,000 time
steps, maybe 10 iterations,

00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:54.120
means 10 different
initial values

00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:57.300
that you try before you
convert to a solution.

00:27:57.300 --> 00:28:00.430
And then you may have
to actually compute

00:28:00.430 --> 00:28:04.380
the Jacobian of
g, inside f solve,

00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:07.230
if it's going to use
the Newton-Raphson step,

00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:09.180
it's going to need
the Jacobian of g.

00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:11.190
The Jacobian of g
takes the number

00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:14.975
of unknowns times the number
of function evaluations

00:28:14.975 --> 00:28:17.100
to compute it by finite
differences-- maybe 2 times

00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:18.420
that number.

00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:23.390
So it's going to be
something like n squared.

00:28:23.390 --> 00:28:26.560
It'll be n squared to
evaluate the Jacobian.

00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:29.660
It takes n operations
to evaluate f.

00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:32.200
So order of n, where n is
the number of variables,

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:35.720
n times that, to the Jacobian,
so it would be like order

00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:41.570
of number variables squared
times 10 times 1,000 is

00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:43.200
kind of an order of the cost.

00:28:47.610 --> 00:28:53.780
And it's only that cost because
we can do an explicit solver.

00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:55.960
If you had to do an
implicit ODE solution,

00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:57.460
it would be a lot
more because you'd

00:28:57.460 --> 00:29:01.770
have to compute the
Jacobians more often.

00:29:01.770 --> 00:29:02.270
All right.

00:29:02.270 --> 00:29:04.720
Is this fun?

00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:05.289
OK.

00:29:05.289 --> 00:29:06.580
So this is the shooting method.

00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:08.340
You guys should be able
to do this no trouble.

00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:10.673
Conceptually, this is not so
different than the homework

00:29:10.673 --> 00:29:13.830
problem you did where you did
an optimization of the parameter

00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:14.775
values.

00:29:14.775 --> 00:29:15.566
Do you remember?

00:29:15.566 --> 00:29:17.190
So you had some
differential equations,

00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:18.450
and you optimize the
parameters to try

00:29:18.450 --> 00:29:19.575
to find the best solutions.

00:29:19.575 --> 00:29:22.045
Here, instead of optimizing
them, you're doing f solve.

00:29:22.045 --> 00:29:24.253
You're trying to solve them
to make something happen.

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:29.920
Now how can this
run into troubles.

00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:33.298
Why would this shooting
method not always work?

00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:37.810
Ready why this might not work?

00:29:43.530 --> 00:29:44.544
Yeah?

00:29:44.544 --> 00:30:00.114
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:00.114 --> 00:30:02.280
PROFESSOR: And a common
case where that might happen

00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:06.520
would be if your ODE
system was unstable,

00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:09.627
Or your ODE solution method
was numerically unstable.

00:30:09.627 --> 00:30:11.960
In either of those cases, who
knows what you're getting.

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:14.376
And actually, you don't know
if the solution is even real.

00:30:14.376 --> 00:30:16.350
You don't know if the
computed final values

00:30:16.350 --> 00:30:22.180
zL is really what corresponds
to that input value of vx0.

00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:25.145
Because, if you have a big
kind of numerical sensitivity

00:30:25.145 --> 00:30:26.241
and instability.

00:30:26.241 --> 00:30:27.490
So that's one kind of problem.

00:30:27.490 --> 00:30:31.510
So this is just like all
the ODE IVP problems.

00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:33.460
If the ODE's problem,
intrinsically,

00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:36.340
is unstable in a big
way, you're in trouble

00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:39.700
because your errors
are going to amplify.

00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:44.030
And then also, if you have
a problem where the delta

00:30:44.030 --> 00:30:47.920
t's are too large compared
to this numerical stability

00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:50.090
of the solver, you'll
also have a problem.

00:30:50.090 --> 00:30:52.210
So those are two kinds of
problems that we always

00:30:52.210 --> 00:30:54.920
have in ODE solutions.

00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:56.560
And so, you might
actually want to use

00:30:56.560 --> 00:31:02.127
this method for some
regular ODE IVP problems.

00:31:02.127 --> 00:31:03.710
So for example, if
you had a problem--

00:31:10.239 --> 00:31:12.030
I don't want to wreck
my beautiful artwork.

00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:19.290
You guys know this.

00:31:19.290 --> 00:31:19.790
All right.

00:31:26.270 --> 00:31:35.096
If you had a problem that
said dy dt is equal to 10

00:31:35.096 --> 00:31:38.700
to the 6th times y.

00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:39.327
Yes?

00:31:39.327 --> 00:31:41.285
AUDIENCE: I have a question
about the Jacobian.

00:31:41.285 --> 00:31:42.868
When you calculate
the Jacobian do you

00:31:42.868 --> 00:31:45.000
have to solve the ODE system?

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.680
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:47.630
Well, two ways.

00:31:47.630 --> 00:31:50.880
You can either solve
it for repeated values,

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:56.100
different initial values, of
v0, and by finite difference,

00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:57.060
get the Jacobian.

00:31:57.060 --> 00:31:59.460
Or you could use the
sensitivity method

00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:03.564
that we did in the second
problem, a problem set ago,

00:32:03.564 --> 00:32:05.730
and analytically get the
derivatives without respect

00:32:05.730 --> 00:32:07.402
to the parameters either way.

00:32:07.402 --> 00:32:08.860
But either way,
it's a lot of work.

00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:19.520
So the from I guess this
is a very simple problem,

00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:23.116
and suppose you wanted to go
all the way out to t equals 1.

00:32:23.116 --> 00:32:30.605
Now, the problem is that the
solution of this is Ae times 10

00:32:30.605 --> 00:32:33.920
to the 6th times t or something.

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:36.530
So this is really
not looking so great.

00:32:36.530 --> 00:32:39.110
As a problem to solve,
this is about as unstable

00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:40.080
as you can get.

00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:43.472
The tiniest little deviation
anywhere along the way

00:32:43.472 --> 00:32:44.930
is going to make
the thing blow up.

00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:50.630
And so this is not
so great and so even

00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:55.970
if initial condition is
that y of t0 is equal to 10

00:32:55.970 --> 00:33:01.530
to the minus 12, so
actually this is not so bad,

00:33:01.530 --> 00:33:04.250
this is still hard to
solve, numerically.

00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:07.160
But you could flip it
around, and treat it

00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:09.540
as a shooting problem,
and solve it in reverse.

00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:14.130
So you could change variables
that u is equal to negative t.

00:33:14.130 --> 00:33:20.100
And then you'd have dy du
is equal to negative 10

00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:22.410
to the 6 times y.

00:33:22.410 --> 00:33:25.300
And now this is really stable.

00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:28.330
And now you might
want to integrate in.

00:33:28.330 --> 00:33:30.580
So supposed the
original question was,

00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:36.290
what is y of 1 in the
differential equations?

00:33:36.290 --> 00:33:41.127
You could do it in reverse and
say, I'm going to guess, y of 1

00:33:41.127 --> 00:33:41.960
is equal to y guess.

00:33:44.617 --> 00:33:46.700
And I'm going to integrate
it and demand that this

00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:49.050
is my final condition.

00:33:49.050 --> 00:33:52.510
So now this is actually y--

00:33:52.510 --> 00:33:55.840
oh geez, now I'm
confusing myself.

00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:57.740
y of negative 1, I guess.

00:33:57.740 --> 00:34:00.500
So I just flipped the sign, t.

00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:06.190
And to make it easier,
I would do it this way.

00:34:06.190 --> 00:34:08.989
1 minus t.

00:34:08.989 --> 00:34:10.164
Same derivative.

00:34:15.014 --> 00:34:17.929
So there we go. y0 is y guess.

00:34:17.929 --> 00:34:22.710
And y of 1 is 10
to the minus 12.

00:34:22.710 --> 00:34:26.320
So this is my final condition
that I'm trying to shoot to,

00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:27.449
and I'll vary the y guess.

00:34:27.449 --> 00:34:28.199
And they're great.

00:34:28.199 --> 00:34:30.650
And now I have a perfectly
stable differential equation

00:34:30.650 --> 00:34:32.060
I can solve.

00:34:32.060 --> 00:34:33.050
OK.

00:34:33.050 --> 00:34:35.022
So this same idea
of shooting comes up

00:34:35.022 --> 00:34:36.320
in multiple applications.

00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:38.324
And this whole thing
about flipping the change

00:34:38.324 --> 00:34:43.010
in the variables is often
an extremely useful trick

00:34:43.010 --> 00:34:45.710
to just recast the equations in
a way that's more numerically

00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:49.620
stable to solve, has
fewer number of equations,

00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:52.440
you can write explicitly
what you want.

00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:57.350
But this takes some cleverness
to know how to recast them.

00:34:57.350 --> 00:35:03.080
All right, so this motivating
example is a good one.

00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:04.170
Yeah?

00:35:04.170 --> 00:35:07.810
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:07.810 --> 00:35:09.310
PROFESSOR: You
could, but I was just

00:35:09.310 --> 00:35:12.400
trying to get back in the
form of t0 equals zero.

00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:14.440
I guess I could have t0
equals negative 1 do it.

00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:17.236
I just couldn't do the
arithmetic on the board.

00:35:17.236 --> 00:35:23.503
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:23.503 --> 00:35:25.086
PROFESSOR: y of 0
is known, but then I

00:35:25.086 --> 00:35:26.800
have to start from
t0 equals negative 1.

00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:27.880
So I could do--

00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:31.065
so suppose I did u
equals negative t dy

00:35:31.065 --> 00:35:37.860
du is equal to
negative 10 to the 6 y.

00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:44.750
And I know y of 0
is equal to to--

00:35:44.750 --> 00:35:46.550
no, what do I know?

00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:49.420
Yeah, y of 0 is equal
to 10 to the minus 12.

00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:53.890
And y of negative 1
is equal to y yes,

00:35:53.890 --> 00:35:56.530
and I can integrate
from negative 1 over.

00:35:56.530 --> 00:36:00.450
So this will t0 if I was
using the shooting method,

00:36:00.450 --> 00:36:02.790
and this would be t final.

00:36:05.157 --> 00:36:06.990
Or you could shift it
over by 1 if you want,

00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:08.180
and do it the way I did.

00:36:08.180 --> 00:36:11.772
Either one's fine.

00:36:11.772 --> 00:36:14.700
Is that all right?

00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:16.850
Sorry to confuse
all the arithmetic.

00:36:16.850 --> 00:36:18.990
I was getting confused too.

00:36:18.990 --> 00:36:23.585
All right, now I wrote this--

00:36:23.585 --> 00:36:26.540
another situation where
this will not work

00:36:26.540 --> 00:36:30.840
is you can have
systems where you

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:35.230
have both positive and negative
eigenvalues of the Jacobian,

00:36:35.230 --> 00:36:38.800
and that means that
either way you integrate--

00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:41.422
in the plus t direction or
the negative t direction,

00:36:41.422 --> 00:36:42.755
either way it's always unstable.

00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:47.747
So no matter what you
do, you're doomed.

00:36:47.747 --> 00:36:50.330
The IVP method is not going to
work because you're numerically

00:36:50.330 --> 00:36:53.140
unstable in both directions.

00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:55.750
And so that's really
a bummer, and it

00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:59.322
means our ODE IVP method's
not going to work for us,

00:36:59.322 --> 00:37:01.280
and so then we have to
find a different method.

00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:07.580
But before I go into
that, let's just write

00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:11.170
the more general
version of this.

00:37:11.170 --> 00:37:13.109
OK, so this is--

00:37:13.109 --> 00:37:14.400
I think you guys all know this.

00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:24.290
So let's try a more general
version of the ODE IVP problem.

00:37:27.935 --> 00:37:30.130
And now we'll allow for
the fact that things

00:37:30.130 --> 00:37:31.796
don't have to be
explicit, and they have

00:37:31.796 --> 00:37:33.520
to be as simple as we thought.

00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:35.395
And you can see it even
in the problem I just

00:37:35.395 --> 00:37:39.940
did-- we had a vx squared
plus vz squared had

00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:41.350
to be equal to something.

00:37:41.350 --> 00:37:43.570
And so that's not a
simple boundary condition

00:37:43.570 --> 00:37:45.140
like we saw before.

00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:46.990
So you get a more
complicated conditions,

00:37:46.990 --> 00:37:50.740
and what you really can
have is a set of equations,

00:37:50.740 --> 00:38:03.310
gn of dy dt y, t,
and is equal to 0.

00:38:03.310 --> 00:38:17.640
And corresponding, qn of dy
dt evaluated at tn, y of tn,

00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:20.160
tn is equal to 0.

00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:23.300
So this is the
general ODE system

00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:26.770
that's written in
implicit form, and this

00:38:26.770 --> 00:38:32.790
has to be true for
all t in the domain.

00:38:32.790 --> 00:38:36.060
All t that are a
member of t0 to tf.

00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:45.300
So all the t's that are inside
this interval, the domain we

00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:47.820
are about, this is the
differential equation, written

00:38:47.820 --> 00:38:50.610
as just as general
can be, and n is

00:38:50.610 --> 00:38:53.511
equal to 1 and N
in these equations.

00:38:53.511 --> 00:38:57.405
AUDIENCE: Is there a reason you
switched to q of n for the--

00:38:57.405 --> 00:38:59.030
PROFESSOR: I just
want to make it clear

00:38:59.030 --> 00:39:01.680
that this is the conditions, and
this is the general equation.

00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:02.370
I don't know.

00:39:02.370 --> 00:39:03.745
You can write it
anyway you want.

00:39:05.802 --> 00:39:07.760
Do you like some variable
letters instead of q?

00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:08.780
I can change this.

00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:10.877
AUDIENCE: No, I
was just checking.

00:39:10.877 --> 00:39:12.960
PROFESSOR: This one, I'm
just trying to emphasize.

00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:16.940
This one is only
true at tn only.

00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:22.050
This equation, this
is the condition

00:39:22.050 --> 00:39:25.810
at one particular time I
demand something be true,

00:39:25.810 --> 00:39:27.810
and this is the general
difference equation that

00:39:27.810 --> 00:39:28.976
has to be true at all times.

00:39:31.942 --> 00:39:36.920
If I have n differentials, I
need n differential equations,

00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:39.680
and n initial conditions.

00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:43.280
By the way, you can write
the DAEs this way as well--

00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:45.410
the differential algebraic
equations, and then

00:39:45.410 --> 00:39:47.870
you just won't have as
many initial conditions

00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:50.930
because every time you have
an algebraic equation instead

00:39:50.930 --> 00:39:52.595
of a differential
equation, then you

00:39:52.595 --> 00:39:55.220
don't need the initial condition
because the algebraic equation

00:39:55.220 --> 00:39:58.900
has its own condition.

00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:00.540
Does that make sense?

00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:03.090
All right, so you can write
this in general, and just

00:40:03.090 --> 00:40:04.500
by depending on how many
differentials you have,

00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:06.000
that's how many
conditions you need.

00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:11.490
A lot of times, you can
write them explicit.

00:40:11.490 --> 00:40:18.814
This thing is equivalent to
dy dt is equal to f of ty.

00:40:21.990 --> 00:40:24.460
Many times, you can solve for
dy dt, and write this way,

00:40:24.460 --> 00:40:25.700
but not always.

00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:36.440
OK All right, and the reason
why we need to have n conditions

00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:38.150
is just like when
you're doing integrals,

00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:39.740
you'd have n constants
of integration.

00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:42.020
Every time you do an
integral, you get one,

00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:43.550
now you have three.

00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:45.050
We have n differential
equations.

00:40:45.050 --> 00:40:46.415
We'll have n conditions.

00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:53.440
All right?

00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:59.130
Now, a bad thing about
these problems, in general,

00:40:59.130 --> 00:41:03.360
is that the solutions depend a
lot on the boundary conditions.

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:08.670
And in fact, you can write
down boundary conditions

00:41:08.670 --> 00:41:12.965
that are not achievable, which
means there's no solution.

00:41:12.965 --> 00:41:14.340
So this is really
a bummer if you

00:41:14.340 --> 00:41:16.830
don't realize you did it because
you could try to solve it

00:41:16.830 --> 00:41:18.705
all day, and you'll
never solve it because it

00:41:18.705 --> 00:41:20.460
doesn't have a solution.

00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:28.730
So for example, in this problem,
if I set L to be too large,

00:41:28.730 --> 00:41:30.170
the cannonball
can't go that far.

00:41:30.170 --> 00:41:33.640
I can't set L to
be 3,000 kilometers

00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:35.890
and get a solution because
the muzzle velocity is not

00:41:35.890 --> 00:41:37.556
high enough that the
cannonball is going

00:41:37.556 --> 00:41:39.335
to travel 3,000 kilometers.

00:41:39.335 --> 00:41:41.710
But when I wrote the problem,
you didn't see that, right?

00:41:41.710 --> 00:41:44.200
You didn't come and tell
me, whoa, watch out.

00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:48.390
There's no way L could be
bigger than such as such.

00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:50.200
And so you might not know it.

00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:55.600
You might specify a condition
that's just not achievable.

00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:58.150
I used to work an industry,
this happened a lot.

00:41:58.150 --> 00:42:00.160
My manager would specify
boundary conditions

00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:03.280
which were not achievable.

00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:07.330
I want 99% yield and
a 10% cost reduction.

00:42:07.330 --> 00:42:08.410
Go!

00:42:08.410 --> 00:42:11.170
And I'm the engineer, I'm
trying to work it out,

00:42:11.170 --> 00:42:14.950
and then sometimes it
didn't even come out.

00:42:14.950 --> 00:42:17.810
So in some ways, it's a
lot better to just say max.

00:42:17.810 --> 00:42:20.010
Please maximize this
as best you can,

00:42:20.010 --> 00:42:23.110
subject to your constraints,
instead of specifying this.

00:42:23.110 --> 00:42:25.360
But of course, I don't
know why, there's

00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:29.380
a school of management that says
we weren't definite targets.

00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:33.610
We don't want to be just the
best, we want to be perfect.

00:42:33.610 --> 00:42:34.900
So the no child left behind.

00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:36.880
Every single student
in this class

00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:39.328
is going to really achieve.

00:42:39.328 --> 00:42:44.950
Anyway, that's the
way targets gets set.

00:42:44.950 --> 00:42:47.180
It doesn't have
to be achievable.

00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:49.120
And there's actually
a big branch

00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:52.840
of mathematics about trying
to detect if the boundary

00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:56.590
conditions are indeed consistent
so that they can be achieved,

00:42:56.590 --> 00:42:58.600
and it's not so
obvious to do it.

00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:02.440
So I'm not going to
get into that at all.

00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:03.749
You can take a PDE class.

00:43:03.749 --> 00:43:05.290
There's a math
department, and that's

00:43:05.290 --> 00:43:08.620
all they talk about all day
is about how to figure out

00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:12.675
are these boundary conditions
consistent or not consistent.

00:43:12.675 --> 00:43:14.050
You also have
boundary conditions

00:43:14.050 --> 00:43:16.780
that are repetitive, and
don't have enough information.

00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:18.970
In those cases, you might
have an infinite number

00:43:18.970 --> 00:43:20.442
of solutions.

00:43:20.442 --> 00:43:22.150
And I think you can
also have cases where

00:43:22.150 --> 00:43:25.280
you have multiple solutions.

00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:27.080
So like in the
cannonball problem,

00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:29.822
if you could have a negative
vy, and if the ship was

00:43:29.822 --> 00:43:32.030
close enough, you might be
able to shoot it two ways.

00:43:32.030 --> 00:43:34.536
You can shoot it down at it,
or you could just blow up high

00:43:34.536 --> 00:43:39.010
and come down, and they'll
both be solutions that

00:43:39.010 --> 00:43:42.260
satisfy all the conditions.

00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:45.640
This is like general
non-linear equation problems,

00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:47.837
that you don't know how
many solutions you got,

00:43:47.837 --> 00:43:49.420
you don't know if
you have a solution,

00:43:49.420 --> 00:43:50.650
you might have an infinite
number of solutions,

00:43:50.650 --> 00:43:52.608
you might have some finite
number of solutions,

00:43:52.608 --> 00:43:54.280
you don't know
how many, and it's

00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:56.821
just that's the way life is,
and you'll have to live with it.

00:43:56.821 --> 00:43:58.870
But it's kind of
annoying sometimes.

00:43:58.870 --> 00:44:02.079
For now, let's just assume
that we somehow know

00:44:02.079 --> 00:44:03.370
that we have a unique solution.

00:44:03.370 --> 00:44:04.480
There's a unique
physical solution.

00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:05.740
We're just going to
try to find that,

00:44:05.740 --> 00:44:07.090
and we're not going to worry
about this other problem

00:44:07.090 --> 00:44:08.548
about the fact
there could actually

00:44:08.548 --> 00:44:11.557
be multiple solutions, or
no solution, or whatever.

00:44:11.557 --> 00:44:13.390
When you actually run
into a case like that,

00:44:13.390 --> 00:44:15.910
then you'll really
worry about it a lot.

00:44:15.910 --> 00:44:17.208
Is there a question?

00:44:17.208 --> 00:44:17.707
No?

00:44:17.707 --> 00:44:18.206
OK.

00:44:21.380 --> 00:44:26.620
All right, so we had
an example in actually

00:44:26.620 --> 00:44:29.200
the zeroth homework,
the very beginning,

00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:30.580
that had a problem like this.

00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:42.785
The homework 0P1, we had a
problem where it gave you--

00:44:42.785 --> 00:44:43.660
Do you remember this?

00:44:43.660 --> 00:44:48.310
It was a cylinder, and you
were trying to compute t of r.

00:44:48.310 --> 00:44:49.590
Do you remember this?

00:44:49.590 --> 00:44:53.160
And it gave you some
conditions about here.

00:44:56.830 --> 00:45:02.760
It gave you t when r w was equal
to r, and it gave you dt dr--

00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:06.380
actually, it gave
you some equation.

00:45:06.380 --> 00:45:12.810
It was actually a function of
this and t, all evaluated at r.

00:45:12.810 --> 00:45:14.710
It was equal to something.

00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:16.857
Do you remember this?

00:45:16.857 --> 00:45:18.440
So we gave those
two, but then we also

00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:21.530
told you in the most recent
homework, oh, by the way,

00:45:21.530 --> 00:45:27.140
dt dr has got to be
equal to 0 at r equals 0.

00:45:27.140 --> 00:45:31.330
So this is one of these
ones where we should only

00:45:31.330 --> 00:45:36.550
have two conditions, but we
told you three conditions.

00:45:36.550 --> 00:45:41.180
So were any of you able to
achieve all three conditions?

00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:41.680
No.

00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:44.500
OK, so this is
highlighting the problem.

00:45:44.500 --> 00:45:46.420
So we gave you three
boundary conditions

00:45:46.420 --> 00:45:48.102
that were apparently
incompatible,

00:45:48.102 --> 00:45:50.560
that you couldn't actually
solve them all at the same time.

00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:56.520
So beware, I guess.

00:45:56.520 --> 00:45:58.920
Now, in that problem,
it might have

00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:02.130
been more natural to give
you this equation, which

00:46:02.130 --> 00:46:06.580
we are sure is exactly true by
the symmetry of the situation

00:46:06.580 --> 00:46:08.530
as one of the
conditions, and then only

00:46:08.530 --> 00:46:10.680
one of these other
conditions outside.

00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:13.330
That whichever one we were
more sure was correct,

00:46:13.330 --> 00:46:16.370
might be the thing to do.

00:46:16.370 --> 00:46:19.390
And so we kind of gave you
some goofball conditions.

00:46:19.390 --> 00:46:21.910
I guess, in some ways.

00:46:21.910 --> 00:46:22.410
Yeah?

00:46:22.410 --> 00:46:24.820
AUDIENCE: So if all three of
those conditions are true,

00:46:24.820 --> 00:46:27.230
why wouldn't they
converge to a solution?

00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:29.220
PROFESSOR: They
could all be true,

00:46:29.220 --> 00:46:34.010
and if they were all
true, then if you

00:46:34.010 --> 00:46:36.970
solve the numerical exactly, you
should get the real solution.

00:46:36.970 --> 00:46:38.905
It should satisfy all of them.

00:46:38.905 --> 00:46:40.530
AUDIENCE: So does
that mean one of them

00:46:40.530 --> 00:46:41.482
wasn't true in our case?

00:46:41.482 --> 00:46:42.440
If we weren't able to do--

00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:44.000
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I think
one of them wasn't true,

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:45.666
and I think it's maybe
due to round off.

00:46:49.030 --> 00:46:50.900
But it's highlights a problem.

00:46:50.900 --> 00:46:54.580
If you have three conditions
that should be true,

00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:56.190
but they involve
numbers in them,

00:46:56.190 --> 00:46:58.300
then often they
won't all be exactly

00:46:58.300 --> 00:47:00.200
consistent with each other.

00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:02.090
But there's actually a
worse kind of problem

00:47:02.090 --> 00:47:04.820
because it's close to
being consistent to all

00:47:04.820 --> 00:47:10.400
of those conditions, but
you're not exactly consistent.

00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:12.472
But then if you
get into it, trying

00:47:12.472 --> 00:47:14.180
to figure what's going
on, a lot of times

00:47:14.180 --> 00:47:15.971
you'll get near singular
matrices and stuff

00:47:15.971 --> 00:47:18.320
because you have things
that are nearly linearly

00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:20.310
dependent in some way.

00:47:20.310 --> 00:47:21.980
So really, it's
better if you just

00:47:21.980 --> 00:47:24.440
have the right number of
conditions that you're

00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:27.290
really sure really specify
everything correctly, and just

00:47:27.290 --> 00:47:31.040
go with those, and treat
the ones that you think

00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:33.560
would be nice if they were
true as approximate things that

00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:36.018
are sort of physical checks to
see whether your solution is

00:47:36.018 --> 00:47:37.830
reasonable.

00:47:37.830 --> 00:47:40.290
And we did it sort of like
that in the problem you did.

00:47:40.290 --> 00:47:43.500
We said well, dt dr should
really be equal to 0,

00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:46.350
but we didn't demand
that in your solution.

00:47:46.350 --> 00:47:48.330
Your solution didn't
actually satisfy that,

00:47:48.330 --> 00:47:51.150
and we use that as a measure of
how far off your solution is.

00:47:51.150 --> 00:47:53.059
That's actually pretty
useful in practice.

00:47:53.059 --> 00:47:53.850
You get a solution.

00:47:53.850 --> 00:47:56.040
It's good to have some
additional condition

00:47:56.040 --> 00:47:59.490
that you can test for physical
reasonableness of the solution,

00:47:59.490 --> 00:48:01.080
and particularly because there's
a problem that you might have

00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:02.730
multiple solutions,
and maybe one of them

00:48:02.730 --> 00:48:03.780
is a physical solution,
and one of them

00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:05.490
is some other crazy solution.

00:48:05.490 --> 00:48:08.520
And so you need to
have some way to detect

00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:11.725
the crazy solution by some other
condition that you can test.

00:48:11.725 --> 00:48:12.600
Does that make sense?

00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:21.400
All right, so I said you
could have cases where

00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:26.560
the Jacobian of your equation--

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:33.610
so you could be trying to
solve this, and it could be,

00:48:33.610 --> 00:48:36.230
for some problems
the Jacobian always

00:48:36.230 --> 00:48:40.320
has both positive and
negative eigenvalues together.

00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:42.650
And in that case,
using IVP is not

00:48:42.650 --> 00:48:45.530
going to be a smart idea because
no matter which direction you

00:48:45.530 --> 00:48:49.490
integrate in, you're going to
have a positive eigenvalue,

00:48:49.490 --> 00:48:51.987
and so then the IVP is not good.

00:48:51.987 --> 00:48:54.070
So instead, we're going
to use a different method,

00:48:54.070 --> 00:48:55.540
and we'll talk about
that next time,

00:48:55.540 --> 00:48:57.220
and those are called
relaxation methods.

00:48:59.950 --> 00:49:01.960
And the concept of
these is different

00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:03.250
than it was for shooting.

00:49:03.250 --> 00:49:16.330
So the relaxation method is you
have a wide guess that you're

00:49:16.330 --> 00:49:19.324
going to have a guess
for the entire y

00:49:19.324 --> 00:49:20.490
throughout the whole domain.

00:49:24.310 --> 00:49:26.230
Actually, a lot of
times you might set this

00:49:26.230 --> 00:49:28.720
up so that y guess
actually exactly

00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:30.994
satisfies the
boundary conditions.

00:49:30.994 --> 00:49:32.910
So you know it satisfies
those equations right

00:49:32.910 --> 00:49:35.243
from the beginning just from
the way you set up y guess,

00:49:35.243 --> 00:49:37.950
but it won't satisfy the
differential equation.

00:49:37.950 --> 00:49:44.280
And then what you'll
do is you'll say

00:49:44.280 --> 00:50:01.110
how badly does it fail to
satisfy that g is equal to 0?

00:50:01.110 --> 00:50:04.780
Because we really want g is
equal 0 for the true solution.

00:50:04.780 --> 00:50:10.831
And we'll call this failure
of our y guess to solve this,

00:50:10.831 --> 00:50:12.080
we'll call that the residuals.

00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:15.190
So we can actually plug
in y guess in here,

00:50:15.190 --> 00:50:17.530
and y guess in here,
and evaluate this.

00:50:17.530 --> 00:50:20.560
And normally it will
not be 0 because our y

00:50:20.560 --> 00:50:23.476
guess is not perfect, and so
it's going to deviate from 0.

00:50:23.476 --> 00:50:24.850
But how big it
deviates from 0 is

00:50:24.850 --> 00:50:29.170
going to be our measure
of how bad that guess was,

00:50:29.170 --> 00:50:31.200
and then we're going
to try to change

00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:34.810
y guess to try to make it
closer and closer to 0.

00:50:34.810 --> 00:50:36.220
So the idea is relax it.

00:50:36.220 --> 00:50:38.920
You get an incorrect
solution, and you

00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:43.440
adjust it to relax it to make
it become the correct solution.

00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:46.170
All right, and so that's the
general idea of the relaxation

00:50:46.170 --> 00:50:49.290
method, and we'll talk about
several different forms

00:50:49.290 --> 00:50:49.842
of that.

00:50:49.842 --> 00:50:51.300
Normally, what we
have to do is you

00:50:51.300 --> 00:50:54.210
have to write y guess in
terms of some parameters.

00:50:54.210 --> 00:50:59.347
So y guess of t depends
on some parameters,

00:50:59.347 --> 00:51:00.930
and we're going
adjust the parameters,

00:51:00.930 --> 00:51:03.550
and that's going to
change what y guess is.

00:51:03.550 --> 00:51:06.910
And so for example, we could
do a basis set expansion

00:51:06.910 --> 00:51:08.830
as we did in one of
the earlier classes.

00:51:08.830 --> 00:51:10.540
We talked about how
you could expand

00:51:10.540 --> 00:51:15.419
y guess as a sum of some basis
functions weighted by p's, and

00:51:15.419 --> 00:51:16.960
then you can adjust
the p's, and find

00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:20.470
the best possible set of p's
to make this g as close to 0

00:51:20.470 --> 00:51:22.850
as possible, for example.

00:51:22.850 --> 00:51:25.200
We'll give examples
of that next time.

00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:28.920
There's several choices
about that there.

00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:30.560
All right.
