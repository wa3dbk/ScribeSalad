00:00:25.412 --> 00:00:27.370
PROFESSOR: So today we're
going to keep talking

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:29.280
about boundary value problems.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.080
We'll do that
again on Wednesday.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:37.195
On Friday we'll start partial
differential equations.

00:00:37.195 --> 00:00:41.260
And next week we'll
work with COMSOL,

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.890
which I hope you guys all have
installed on your laptops.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.020
Please check that
you have it installed

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.590
and you can turn it on,
your licensing things

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:51.850
work and stuff like that.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.034
We'll have a COMSOL tutorial
I think on Monday in class.

00:00:56.034 --> 00:00:58.200
And you'll use that for one
of the homework problems

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.430
not immediately but coming up.

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.780
Speaking of the homework,
I received some feedback

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.630
that the homeworks
have been taking

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.000
an inordinate amount of time.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.240
And so I've discussed this
with the other people involved

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.060
in teaching it and we
decided to drastically cut

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.060
the amount of points
given for write-ups to try

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.340
to encourage you not to
spend so much time on that.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.946
And instead I'd really
rather you spent the time

00:01:30.946 --> 00:01:32.570
and did the reading
instead of spending

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.249
an extra hour doing write-up.

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:37.040
You won't get any more
points for doing it.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:37.270
So if you want--

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:38.650
I mean, I love
beautiful write-ups.

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.020
I'm sure the graders appreciate
the beautiful write-ups.

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.040
It's good for your
thinking to write clearly

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.360
but it's not worth many,
many hours of time.

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.280
And in general, the instructions
at the beginning of course,

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.420
are on average over the
course, your 14 weeks,

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.230
it should be about nine
hours per week of homework.

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.475
So that's maybe 13
hours per assignment,

00:01:59.475 --> 00:02:00.980
so you have 10 assignments.

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.424
And so if it's getting
to be 15 hours,

00:02:04.424 --> 00:02:06.590
you've spent too much time
on it and just forget it.

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.300
Just draw a line and say
I'm done, time ran out,

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.640
and that's fine.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.082
This is-- getting the last
bug out of your Matlab code

00:02:16.082 --> 00:02:17.790
is not the main
objective of this course.

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.640
And really, the
purpose of homework

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.117
is to help you
learn, not that we

00:02:28.117 --> 00:02:30.200
need to know what the
solution to this problem is.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.947
This is now--

00:02:30.947 --> 00:02:33.280
I'm getting the solution from
somebody else in the class

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.946
too so this is--

00:02:33.946 --> 00:02:36.465
I don't need it from you.

00:02:36.465 --> 00:02:38.090
The TAs probably
already did it already

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.381
and they have the solution too.

00:02:39.381 --> 00:02:41.080
So we know the solution.

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.320
It's not so essential.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.736
Its purpose is to help you
learn and how to figure it out.

00:02:44.736 --> 00:02:46.580
And beyond a certain
point, it's not

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.860
that instructive
in my experience.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.777
Though sometimes the
fifteenth and a half hour

00:02:52.777 --> 00:02:55.110
you suddenly have the great
insight and you learn a lot,

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.090
but most the time not.

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:12.450
And by the way the reading
is in [? Beer's ?] textbook

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:19.490
pages 258 to 311.

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:22.740
And there's also some nice
short readings by Professor

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.770
[? Brautz ?] that have been
posted, only a few pages long

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.320
but definitely worth a look.

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:38.580
Both on [? PPPs ?] and also
in ODEs and [? DAEs. ?]

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.590
So today what we're
going to talk about

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.510
is relaxation methods.

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.800
And we talked last time
about the shooting method.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.530
So that's a good method.

00:04:07.999 --> 00:04:09.540
At least one famous
numerical methods

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.240
book recommends you always
shoot first then relax.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.130
So try the shooting method.

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:15.511
If it works, you're done.

00:04:15.511 --> 00:04:17.010
If it doesn't work
for you, then you

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.019
may have to use a
relaxation method.

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.920
And we'll talk a bit now
about the relaxation methods.

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:28.480
And the general idea is
you're going to write your y--

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.940
which is an
approximation, it's not

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:31.750
going to be the real solution--

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.700
and you're going to try
to write that typically

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.200
as an expansion to
some basis functions.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.230
So let's say the
nth component of y.

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.220
And then you're going to vary
these coefficients, the d's,

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.379
to try to make your solution
as good as possible.

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:57.420
And now we're talking
about different definitions

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:02.850
of what good is for the
solution for a problem.

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:05.040
And you have to be aware
that almost always, this

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:09.190
will not exactly solve the
differential equation system.

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.453
So it's always going to be
wrong everywhere, typically.

00:05:12.453 --> 00:05:15.059
And you can get to
decide sort of--

00:05:15.059 --> 00:05:17.100
if you wanted to be good
at some particular spot,

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:18.840
you can do something about that.

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:22.260
If you wanted to, on
average, be good in some way,

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:23.790
you can decide that.

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:28.020
And it's sort of how much
error you can tolerate.

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.840
And in general, you have to do
a finite sum of a finite basis

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:32.610
set.

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.045
For many, many ODE,
[? PPP ?] problems,

00:05:35.045 --> 00:05:37.170
there's math proofs that
if-- and the limit is this

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:39.240
goes to infinity if you add an
infinite number of functions

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.900
here.

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.844
You can always make it work
to get the true solution.

00:05:42.844 --> 00:05:44.760
But you can never afford
that so you're always

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:48.960
finite truncated basis
set is what you're using.

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.879
And so a lot of
the accuracy things

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:52.920
have to do with exactly
what functions you choose

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:56.340
and exactly how many of these
terms and sum you include.

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:59.236
But typically, these problems
will start from the beginning,

00:05:59.236 --> 00:06:00.860
you'll say I'm only
going to include so

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.310
many, how big my computer is.

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:07.654
And so you're going to
be stuck with some error,

00:06:07.654 --> 00:06:08.820
so that's just the way this.

00:06:13.916 --> 00:06:15.290
Let's recall the
problem we have.

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:17.270
If we write it in the--

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:19.265
as a first order ODE
system, it's dy/dt--

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:28.650
well, there's some function
of dy/dt and y and t

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:33.010
that's equal to zero which
often can be written something

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:40.898
like this, dy/dt is equal
to an f [INAUDIBLE]..

00:06:40.898 --> 00:06:42.320
Right?

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:47.820
And so if you plug in
this approximation for y,

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:53.460
then you'll get something here
that will be some g of t that's

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:56.280
generally not going
to equal zero,

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:57.680
but you would like
it to be zero.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.910
If you put the true solution
in, you would get zero.

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:01.950
If you put your
approximate solution,

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:04.450
it is not going to be zero.

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:06.550
So you'll get g
of t and you want

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:11.010
this equal to zero for all t.

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:17.940
And then in addition, you
have boundary conditions.

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:21.870
And so you have boundary
conditions on the solution

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:24.175
and you want those
things to be satisfied.

00:07:24.175 --> 00:07:25.800
And again, you can
write them in a form

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.870
that something has to be zero.

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:31.147
Often, you'll
exactly satisfy them.

00:07:31.147 --> 00:07:32.730
So you'll choose
your solution to make

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:34.890
sure it satisfies the
boundary conditions

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:36.417
and it won't satisfy
in the domain.

00:07:36.417 --> 00:07:38.500
It won't really satisfy
the differential equation.

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:41.345
That's the most
common thing to do.

00:07:41.345 --> 00:07:43.720
But it could also be that it
doesn't satisfy the boundary

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:47.130
conditions either, but you
want to be close to satisfy

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:48.245
the boundary conditions.

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:56.250
We have to think
of how are we going

00:07:56.250 --> 00:08:00.810
to judge if the solution
is accurate or not,

00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:02.310
if our approximate
solution is good?

00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:11.350
And from the way we wrote it,
we have our parameters, d.

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:13.300
These are numbers we can adjust.

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:15.940
And we're going to try to adjust
them to make the solution as

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:17.850
good as possible.

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:19.580
And now we just define
what a good means.

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:23.610
There are several definitions
of good that are widely used.

00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:28.469
And one of them is
called collocation.

00:08:28.469 --> 00:08:29.760
This is like option number one.

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:44.310
And that is you choose a set of
ts, of particular time points.

00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:46.800
And for those
particular type points

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:52.920
you demand that g of the
time point is equal to zero.

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:58.170
So you're forcing the
residuals-- this is called

00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:01.320
the residual, it's the error.

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:03.970
And you're forcing the error to
be zero at some particular time

00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:05.420
points.

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:07.480
And generally between
the time points

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:10.887
it will not be equal to zero.

00:09:10.887 --> 00:09:13.220
But you can pick your time
points and depending on which

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:15.470
ones you pick, you'll get a
slightly different optimal

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:17.720
choice of the d's.

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:19.970
Because the d's will
be adjusted to force

00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:23.610
the residual to be zero at
your time points you pick.

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:26.200
So that's one option.

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.381
Another one is
called Rayleigh-Ritz.

00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:41.450
And that one is you
minimize overall your d's.

00:09:45.572 --> 00:09:55.968
The integral in t zero to t
final of the norm of g of t.

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:04.330
So this means you try
to make the average

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:08.940
of the square of that deviation
to be as small as possible.

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:10.980
So it's like sort of
like a least squares fit

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:13.260
kind of thing.

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.180
So that's another option.

00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:18.550
And then a third
one that people use

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:20.020
a lot is called
Galerkin's Method.

00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:31.925
And his method is you
choose some functions--

00:10:31.925 --> 00:10:35.390
some of your basis
functions typically--

00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:38.524
and you integrate them
with each of the elements

00:10:38.524 --> 00:10:39.190
of the residual.

00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:46.310
And you demand that that
has to be equal to zero.

00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:46.967
Yeah?

00:10:46.967 --> 00:10:49.402
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
for [? this method, ?]

00:10:49.402 --> 00:10:50.870
what do you [INAUDIBLE]?

00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:54.259
PROFESSOR: The d's,
your coefficients.

00:10:54.259 --> 00:10:55.800
And these ones, I
didn't write it out

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:58.580
but this g depends
implicitly on the d's,

00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:01.166
so you can write it that way.

00:11:01.166 --> 00:11:04.152
A lot of d's.

00:11:04.152 --> 00:11:07.460
And so you optimize the
d's, you very the d's

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:11.520
to force g to be
zero at certain ts.

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:15.490
And this one also,
the g depends on d's.

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:17.410
And so you're going
to optimize the d's

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:21.395
to force this integral
equation to be satisfied.

00:11:21.395 --> 00:11:21.895
Yeah?

00:11:21.895 --> 00:11:25.109
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
all changing d's?

00:11:25.109 --> 00:11:25.775
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:11:25.775 --> 00:11:26.816
They're all changing d's.

00:11:26.816 --> 00:11:30.590
And it's just trying to-- your
criterion, your error measure,

00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:34.194
how do you measure or
what do you think is good?

00:11:34.194 --> 00:11:36.360
You want to make something
small, some kind of error

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:37.170
small, but you
have to figure out

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:38.550
what are you going to
define your error to be.

00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:40.383
And you'll get different
solutions depending

00:11:40.383 --> 00:11:42.160
on which error measure you use.

00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:45.950
Is this OK?

00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:54.820
Now this one's pretty
straightforward.

00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:57.675
I'm just going to write it down
a bunch of algebraic equations

00:11:57.675 --> 00:11:59.966
that depend on my d's and
then I'm going to solve them.

00:11:59.966 --> 00:12:05.680
And this looks a lot like
[? an f ?] [? solve ?] problem.

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:07.845
This is a Newton problem
or something like that.

00:12:07.845 --> 00:12:10.125
So it's just some
algebraic equations.

00:12:10.125 --> 00:12:12.149
Should be OK?

00:12:12.149 --> 00:12:14.690
So that one you should be pretty
well set up to do right now.

00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:17.190
Let's just think of how
many equations there are.

00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:27.340
So we have-- say we have
our basis set yf t dni fit.

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:31.630
That's our basis set.

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:35.890
And this is a sum over
i equals one to say

00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:37.790
the number of basis functions.

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:39.040
What do you want to call that?

00:12:42.672 --> 00:12:44.190
N, sound good?

00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:46.590
So we have n basis functions.

00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:50.524
And so we have how
many unknowns here?

00:12:50.524 --> 00:12:52.190
Maybe n's not good
because n's this one.

00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:53.600
Let's call it something else.

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:55.130
k, OK.

00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:56.172
All right?

00:12:56.172 --> 00:12:57.630
In fact, I'll even
change this to k

00:12:57.630 --> 00:12:58.900
too just to make life easier.

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:07.140
So there are how
many dnk's are there?

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:09.510
There's n where n
is the dimension,

00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:13.490
the number of od's or the number
of components in y times k.

00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:20.894
That's how many d's we got
that we're going to adjust.

00:13:20.894 --> 00:13:23.310
We want to have an equal number
of equations and unknowns.

00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:25.060
We have to have as
many equations as that.

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:30.790
So what equations do we got?

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:32.010
How many equations?

00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:43.100
So if we just have
a ODE [? BBP ?]

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:47.088
we typically have n
boundary conditions.

00:13:51.349 --> 00:13:53.140
So that many boundary
conditions because we

00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:55.930
need one boundary condition
for each differential equation,

00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:56.430
right?

00:13:56.430 --> 00:13:58.330
One integration
constant for each one.

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:02.360
So we took an n
boundary conditions.

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:03.510
And then we have--

00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:06.850
in collocation, we have however
many capital M time points

00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:07.360
we chose.

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:16.760
So we have M n equations--

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:18.192
no, that's not right.

00:14:18.192 --> 00:14:21.345
We have an equation like that
for every component of g.

00:14:21.345 --> 00:14:28.722
So it's M times n equations
from the collocation.

00:14:34.024 --> 00:14:36.690
Is that all right?

00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:39.150
So just looking
at this, it looks

00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:47.220
like we have n times
M plus one equations

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:52.630
and we have n times k unknowns
that we're trying to adjust.

00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:56.220
And so therefore, this
says we should choose k

00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:57.620
to be equal to M plus one.

00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:03.760
So if we choose we want to say
we want 100 basis functions,

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:07.510
then we need 99 time points to
do collocations at it in order

00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:10.511
to exactly determine everything.

00:15:10.511 --> 00:15:11.360
Is that OK?

00:15:13.865 --> 00:15:15.240
How many people
think this is OK?

00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:18.330
OK.

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:18.829
He agrees.

00:15:18.829 --> 00:15:20.090
It's OK.

00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:21.899
The rest of you, no opinion.

00:15:21.899 --> 00:15:23.690
This is like the American
political system.

00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:25.370
Only 5% people vote.

00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:27.920
Everybody else just
listens to Donald Trump.

00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:37.750
So this is how many
equations we need.

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:42.030
Now sometimes people will
choose the basis functions

00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:44.540
so that, say, some of the
boundary condition equations

00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:46.782
might be satisfied
automatically.

00:15:46.782 --> 00:15:49.090
And I'll talk a little bit
in a minute about cleverness

00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:51.330
in choosing basis functions.

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:53.830
So one possible thing is you
can try to cleverly choose

00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:56.560
basis functions so that no
matter what values of d's you

00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:59.320
choose, you're always going to
satisfy some of the boundary

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:01.410
conditions.

00:16:01.410 --> 00:16:05.500
And so long as you don't
get a full value of n

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:07.640
because some of these
boundary conditions

00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:10.250
don't help you determine
the d's, any values

00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:11.380
of d's will work.

00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:14.309
And so in those cases, you need
a few-- might need another time

00:16:14.309 --> 00:16:15.100
point or something.

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:16.335
Get some more equations.

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:21.910
So that's collocation.

00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:26.750
And I think this should be
perfectly straightforward.

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:28.660
You just evaluate your y's.

00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:30.370
You need to have your dy/dts.

00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:33.040
You'll need them, because
they appear in g as well.

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:37.040
And they're just going to be
the summation over k [? of ?]

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:42.880
[? dnk ?] v prime k of t.

00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:45.030
And so you choose
basis functions

00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:47.230
that the analytical
derivatives of.

00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:49.640
So now you know these answers.

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:55.980
And now you can evaluate
this at any time point tm.

00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:57.860
So you evaluate
your time points.

00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:00.190
You evaluate these guys
at your time points.

00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:04.920
You plug them all into your
g expression over here,

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:10.270
and your force is equal to
zero, by varying the d's, right?

00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:11.534
No problem.

00:17:11.534 --> 00:17:12.450
So that's collocation.

00:17:12.450 --> 00:17:13.619
That's pretty easy.

00:17:13.619 --> 00:17:19.109
And because it's so easy, it's
kind of pretty widely used

00:17:19.109 --> 00:17:22.447
as one way to go.

00:17:22.447 --> 00:17:24.780
All it requires is that you
have to know the derivatives

00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:27.569
of your basis functions.

00:17:27.569 --> 00:17:30.035
In particular, doesn't
require any integrals.

00:17:30.035 --> 00:17:31.660
When you see the
other methods, they're

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:32.784
going to involve integrals.

00:17:32.784 --> 00:17:35.520
So we'll have to figure out
how we're going evaluate those.

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:37.580
So if you have
functions you don't

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:39.800
know how to integrate then
this is definitely the way

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:41.900
to go, to do collocation.

00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:44.990
And if you use collocation
with enough points,

00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:47.394
you're forcing the error
to be zero a lot of points,

00:17:47.394 --> 00:17:49.810
then probably it won't get
that big in between the points.

00:17:49.810 --> 00:17:51.620
At least you can
hope that I won't get

00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:53.090
that big between the points.

00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:55.310
And you can try it with
different numbers of points.

00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:56.726
And different size
numbers of base

00:17:56.726 --> 00:17:59.720
functions and see
what you can do.

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:02.120
See if it converges to
something, if you're lucky.

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:02.620
All right.

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:04.680
So that's one way to go.

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:07.516
And it's just f solve problem.

00:18:07.516 --> 00:18:09.890
And all that's happening is
it's just forming a Dracovian

00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:11.639
Matrix inside there.

00:18:11.639 --> 00:18:14.180
Now, you still have to choose
which basis functions you want.

00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:15.680
And there's a lot
of basis functions

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:19.130
you know that you know
the derivatives of.

00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:25.250
So there's some issues here
about what choice is best.

00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:27.321
And we'll talk a little
about that in a minute.

00:18:27.321 --> 00:18:28.820
One thing you have
to watch out for,

00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:30.403
is you don't want
your basis functions

00:18:30.403 --> 00:18:34.370
to be linearly dependent
because then you'll end up

00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:37.520
with indeterminate values a d.

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:44.080
Different sets of d's will
give you exactly the same y.

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:48.290
If these phi's-- if one of these
phi's is a linear combination

00:18:48.290 --> 00:18:52.455
of other phi's in your set, then
you could have different values

00:18:52.455 --> 00:18:54.830
of d's that would actually
correspond to exactly the same

00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:55.460
y.

00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:58.850
Because of that, when you a
Jacobian Matrix as part of it

00:18:58.850 --> 00:19:00.470
your Newton solve,
the Jacobian's

00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:02.630
going to be singular, and
then the whole thing's

00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:04.570
not going to work.

00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:07.337
So that's one thing
to watch out for.

00:19:07.337 --> 00:19:08.920
And actually, it
doesn't really matter

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:12.610
if the functions are orthogonal
in the sense of being functions

00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:18.940
orthogonal, it's really whether
the vector, vk evaluated tm,

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:21.049
if those are independent
of each other or not.

00:19:21.049 --> 00:19:23.340
I feel like we talked about
this before, one time, yes?

00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:23.840
Yes.

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:25.710
All right.

00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:28.650
So anyway, as long as
the vk evaluate of tm,

00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:30.210
if those things
are vectors which

00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:31.970
are not linerally
dependent on each other,

00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:33.474
this should work fine.

00:19:33.474 --> 00:19:35.720
OK?

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:36.220
All right.

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:44.310
Now, really [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:49.890
This one here often gets
to be kind of messy.

00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:53.860
Part of it is that inside
this norm of this vector,

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:57.035
it's square, so you end up
getting squares of your d's.

00:19:57.035 --> 00:19:58.410
So, the whole
thing is definitely

00:19:58.410 --> 00:20:01.155
non-linear in d to start with.

00:20:01.155 --> 00:20:03.780
And then you have to be able to
evaluate all the integrals that

00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:04.310
come up.

00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:12.840
So this is really
sum over n, of g

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:23.262
and of td squared that
you're trying to integrate.

00:20:23.262 --> 00:20:26.800
[INAUDIBLE] Right?

00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:29.770
So, you have a lot of
these function squared.

00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:31.430
You have to add them up.

00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:34.370
You could do it, but the algebra
gets a little complicated.

00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:36.900
So, this is not so
commonly done unless the g

00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:40.005
has some special form that makes
the algebra a little easier.

00:20:40.005 --> 00:20:42.130
But there's no reason you
can't do it in principle,

00:20:42.130 --> 00:20:45.030
but it just is a little bit of
a mess because you get a lot

00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:48.260
of integrals of cross
terms between the g's.

00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:51.040
And in the d's inside there.

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:55.510
And so, not so commonly done.

00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:57.470
Though one case where
it is done a lot

00:20:57.470 --> 00:20:59.990
is in actually
quantum chemistry.

00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:02.780
Methods called variational
methods in quantum chemistry

00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:05.900
use real [INAUDIBLE] to
figure out the coefficients,

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:08.520
and like your orbitals,
and stuff like that.

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:10.080
So, it'd be certain methods.

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:12.080
But they've actually gone
out of favor recently.

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:14.500
So, you probably won't
use it that often.

00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:17.960
But in the past,
that was a big deal.

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:22.070
Galerkin is used the
most of anything,

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:25.950
so let's talk about
that one for a minute.

00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:29.210
Now, the concept, where does
this equation come from?

00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:30.840
I guess that's one thing.

00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:32.960
So maybe we can back
up and say, well,

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:35.274
where did the
collocation come from?

00:21:35.274 --> 00:21:37.190
Collocation is actually
like a special version

00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:40.340
of this where I choose, instead
of these basis functions,

00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:42.540
I use delta functions.

00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:47.460
So, if I integrated with
delta functions, t minus tm.

00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:49.320
Another way to look
at the collocation

00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:55.440
is demanding that the integral
of delta function t minus tm g

00:21:55.440 --> 00:22:01.100
n a t dt is equal to zero.

00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:03.540
OK.

00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:07.550
So, now instead of
using delta functions,

00:22:07.550 --> 00:22:09.450
I'm using these functions.

00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:11.250
Basis functions.

00:22:11.250 --> 00:22:13.300
So I don't know if it's
particularly obvious why

00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:16.180
you'd use one or the other,
but anyway, you have a choice.

00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:19.560
And any time you do this kind
of integral with some number

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:22.110
of functions, you get some
number of equations that can

00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:25.032
help you determine the d's.

00:22:25.032 --> 00:22:29.250
This particular choice
of the basis functions--

00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:34.740
one way to look at it is,
you can say, well, suppose

00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:43.540
my solution g g n,
suppose I could write this

00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:47.770
as a sum of some different
expansion coefficients.

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:22.857
So I can relate this plus

00:23:22.857 --> 00:23:23.940
OK, so, there's two terms.

00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:26.870
One is the expansion of
the residuals in the basis

00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:30.909
that I'm using, and
one is all the rest

00:23:30.909 --> 00:23:32.700
going on to infinity
of all the other basis

00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:35.140
functions in the universe.

00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:40.230
And if I think my basis set
is very complete, that it kind

00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:41.820
of cover all the
kinds of functions

00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:45.270
I'm ever going to deal
with, both in y and in g,

00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:48.214
in the residual, then this
would be a reasonable thing,

00:23:48.214 --> 00:23:50.130
and you might expect
that this term-- if you'd

00:23:50.130 --> 00:23:52.990
pick big K big enough,
this might be small.

00:23:52.990 --> 00:23:54.780
So that's sort of
where the idea is.

00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:58.480
So then, if I think
this is small,

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:00.540
then I want to make
sure I make this part as

00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:03.340
close to accurate as possible.

00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:07.370
And this condition is
basically doing that.

00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:13.750
It's saying that I want the
[? error ?] to be orthogonal

00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:17.030
to the basis functions,
in the sense that,

00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:19.655
for two functions, the integral
of the two functions like this,

00:24:19.655 --> 00:24:21.863
is like an inner product,
just like the inner product

00:24:21.863 --> 00:24:23.020
between two vectors.

00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:25.360
So I'm saying, like,
in the vector space,

00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:27.310
in the function space
that I'm working in,

00:24:27.310 --> 00:24:28.610
I don't want to have any error.

00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:30.430
That's what this is saying.

00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:34.390
But I'm going to have is that
there's other g terms which

00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:36.610
are the rest over here.

00:24:36.610 --> 00:24:42.360
These guys will not be
orthogonal to the first part.

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:44.160
Does that make sense?

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:47.270
So there's still some
error left, in my g.

00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:52.480
But the part in here, I can
make a good [? answer. ?]

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:56.331
So that's where this equation
comes from conceptually.

00:24:56.331 --> 00:24:58.205
All right.

00:24:58.205 --> 00:25:00.705
And we'll come back-- when we
do least square [? setting, ?]

00:25:00.705 --> 00:25:03.090
we'll come back
to that same idea.

00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:08.970
So this is what the
equation looks like,

00:25:08.970 --> 00:25:15.310
and the disadvantage of this one
is it involves some integrals.

00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:18.520
And so you have to be able
to evaluate the integrals.

00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:20.080
All right.

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:22.580
So that's the downside
of this function.

00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:24.580
So cleverly choosing
using your basis functions

00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:27.790
to make it easy to evaluate the
integrals is like the key thing

00:25:27.790 --> 00:25:28.960
to make this a good method.

00:25:31.790 --> 00:25:35.210
And just like we needed
analytical expressions

00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:38.450
for the derivatives here, now
we need analytical expressions

00:25:38.450 --> 00:25:39.550
for integrals.

00:25:39.550 --> 00:25:41.340
That we're going to
get from this guy.

00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:41.840
OK.

00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:49.170
So, let's think about what basis
functions we can choose that

00:25:49.170 --> 00:25:52.260
might make it easier to
evaluate the integrals.

00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:54.220
Suppose we can
write g explicitly.

00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:54.720
Like, this.

00:25:54.720 --> 00:26:02.307
So, g is equal to d
gx dyn/dt minus f/n.

00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:06.480
Suppose.

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:07.560
OK?

00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:10.840
Then what integrals
am I going to get?

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:15.420
Well, dyn/dt is the sum of
the derivatives of the basis

00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:22.290
functions, and y is
just this sum up there.

00:26:22.290 --> 00:26:24.102
Some of the basis functions.

00:26:24.102 --> 00:26:25.560
And so, I'm going
to have integrals

00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:41.210
that look like this is like
I have an integral phi j

00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:46.200
summation d phi prime.

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:48.878
No, k.

00:26:48.878 --> 00:26:49.378
t.

00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:54.210
dt.

00:26:54.210 --> 00:26:56.490
That will be the integrals
from the first term.

00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:05.380
And then I'll have minus some
integrals from the second term

00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:05.990
here.

00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:19.250
So, phi j fn ft y, where y
is the sum-- it's actually

00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:20.447
like a matrix.

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:33.500
All right.

00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:35.510
Because this y is a vector.

00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:38.110
It's all the yns.

00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:45.400
And so, the whole y vector
is d times the phi vector.

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:53.837
All right.

00:27:53.837 --> 00:27:54.920
Where d's that big matrix.

00:27:54.920 --> 00:28:02.130
The elements are
[? dnk. ?] And so,

00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:04.920
if you cut these
integrals, this thing

00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:09.400
here is a summation
of [? dnk. ?]

00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:11.930
The integral of phi j.

00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:12.780
Phi k prime.

00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:20.920
And so, if you choose your
basis functions cleverly,

00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:24.230
you might be able to know all
these integrals analytically.

00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:24.937
OK?

00:28:24.937 --> 00:28:26.520
But if you don't
choose them cleverly,

00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:28.853
who knows what kind of horrible
mess you'll end up here.

00:28:28.853 --> 00:28:30.150
All right.

00:28:30.150 --> 00:28:32.400
Ideally, you really want to
get these all analytically

00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:35.029
so you don't have to do
numerical integration.

00:28:35.029 --> 00:28:36.820
As a loop inside, all
the rest of the work,

00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:38.893
you're going to do
in this problem.

00:28:38.893 --> 00:28:40.160
OK?

00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:43.310
And then, these ones also,
now knowing something about

00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:45.350
this is really
important or you may

00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:48.830
have to do the numerical
integration here, because this

00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:50.200
could be really a mess.

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:52.490
You have a lot of phis
inside some function, which

00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:54.466
could be a non-linear
function of these guys.

00:28:54.466 --> 00:28:56.590
And so, in principle this
could be really horrible.

00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:05.384
So you may have to do numerical
quadrature for those guys.

00:29:05.384 --> 00:29:06.348
All right.

00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:17.770
OK, and so, if you do Galerkin's
method, a big part of that

00:29:17.770 --> 00:29:20.080
is thinking ahead of time,
oh, what basis function am I

00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:20.720
going to use?

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:22.219
How can I make a
basis function so I

00:29:22.219 --> 00:29:24.550
can evaluate the
integrals easily,

00:29:24.550 --> 00:29:27.870
and then I might have
a chance to do it?

00:29:27.870 --> 00:29:29.322
All right, questions so far?

00:29:32.268 --> 00:29:34.240
AUDIENCE: Phi j

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:36.990
PROFESSOR: Phi j.

00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:38.180
Sorry, phi j of t.

00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:39.940
Here, I'll get rid of the t's.

00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:41.800
These are both functions of t.

00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:44.640
You're integrating over t.

00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:47.770
And these integrals
from t0 to to t phi.

00:29:47.770 --> 00:29:48.870
Your domain.

00:29:52.550 --> 00:29:53.420
All right.

00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:55.010
Now in Galerkin's
method, in addition

00:29:55.010 --> 00:29:56.630
to these integral
equations, I still

00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:58.046
have the integrals,
the equations,

00:29:58.046 --> 00:29:59.570
that the boundary conditions.

00:29:59.570 --> 00:30:01.028
So I still have
some equations that

00:30:01.028 --> 00:30:06.134
look like collocation equations
that are evaluated at tm.

00:30:06.134 --> 00:30:08.990
Do I have that anywhere?

00:30:08.990 --> 00:30:10.550
Nowhere.

00:30:10.550 --> 00:30:12.960
I have an equation like this,
except it's not g, it's q,

00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:14.819
it's the boundary
condition equations

00:30:14.819 --> 00:30:16.610
have to be true at the
boundary conditions.

00:30:16.610 --> 00:30:17.110
Right?

00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:21.110
So they're the same as
before, q [? or just ?]

00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:33.540
before qn of dy/dt
evaluated at tn y of tn.

00:30:36.396 --> 00:30:37.570
tn.

00:30:37.570 --> 00:30:38.530
This is equal to 0.

00:30:38.530 --> 00:30:42.320
This is sort of the general way
to write a boundary condition.

00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:45.240
And so there'll be some special
ends, the boundaries, where I

00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:47.404
want to have extra conditions.

00:30:47.404 --> 00:30:48.820
I'll get some
equations like this.

00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:52.650
These have to be satisfied
in Galerkin's method as well

00:30:52.650 --> 00:30:55.650
and they will not be integrals.

00:30:55.650 --> 00:30:57.640
They are just that, tn.

00:30:57.640 --> 00:31:02.610
And so in addition to the
integral equations, that you

00:31:02.610 --> 00:31:05.110
have to solve over here, you
want these things to be zero

00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:07.818
and you also want to satisfy
the boundary conditions.

00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:15.930
So then, all these
methods, a big part of it

00:31:15.930 --> 00:31:20.890
gets to be cleverness of a basis
function, a choice of basis

00:31:20.890 --> 00:31:22.270
functions.

00:31:22.270 --> 00:31:26.690
And there's kind of two
families of approaches.

00:31:26.690 --> 00:31:33.280
So, one family is
global basis functions.

00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:37.240
So basis functions that are
defined on the whole domain.

00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:42.280
And there are special
ones, sines and cosines,

00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:45.630
Bessel functions,
all these functions

00:31:45.630 --> 00:31:48.210
inferred from your classes,
all the special functions.

00:31:48.210 --> 00:31:52.605
And a lot of them, the integrals
are known for a lot of cases.

00:31:52.605 --> 00:31:54.230
There might be special
tricks that make

00:31:54.230 --> 00:31:56.590
the integrals easy to evaluate.

00:31:56.590 --> 00:31:59.740
They can satisfy the boundary
conditions automatically.

00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:02.590
And some of them, for
example, many of the problems

00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:06.820
we have with like the heat
flow equation, so you have--

00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:12.704
actually it won't be d.

00:32:12.704 --> 00:32:14.245
I'm probably going
to get this wrong.

00:32:14.245 --> 00:32:16.372
It's, like, kappa or alpha.

00:32:16.372 --> 00:32:17.600
Which one is it?

00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:18.920
Alpha.

00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:25.810
Alpha d square of td, x
squared minus, there's

00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:30.016
some source of heat that might
depend on the temperature,

00:32:30.016 --> 00:32:31.640
and this has to be,
say, equal to zero.

00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:38.970
Right, does this seem what
you've seen in classes before?

00:32:38.970 --> 00:32:40.230
So this is a common one.

00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:47.040
So, in this case, you might try
t to be a sum of, say, sines.

00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:56.440
So [? dnk ?] sine of k
something something something.

00:32:56.440 --> 00:33:00.600
In there, and the
cleverness of this

00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:10.740
is that d squared
phi k dx squared is

00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:14.550
going to be equal to
some number times phi k.

00:33:14.550 --> 00:33:19.822
Because the second derivatives
of sines are also sines.

00:33:19.822 --> 00:33:20.760
Right?

00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:23.130
So all your
differentials will solve

00:33:23.130 --> 00:33:27.520
and in fact, the derivatives
will be really simple.

00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:30.272
Now, the q terms could
still be a horrible mess.

00:33:30.272 --> 00:33:32.480
For example, this could be
an Arrhenius thing where's

00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:33.999
the t's up in the exponent.

00:33:33.999 --> 00:33:35.790
And then the whole
thing might be horrible.

00:33:35.790 --> 00:33:36.700
Anyway.

00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:39.120
But at least the differential
part is, like, super easy.

00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:40.320
OK.

00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:43.910
And you might have a boundary
condition say, at one end,

00:33:43.910 --> 00:33:52.600
that dt/dx at someplace like d
final x final is equal to zero.

00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:53.100
Right?

00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:55.060
That might be like, you're
up against a x insulator.

00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:55.840
Or something like that.

00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:57.110
So, you don't have a heat flow.

00:33:57.110 --> 00:33:59.230
So that would be a boundary
condition you might have.

00:33:59.230 --> 00:34:01.730
And then, by cleverly choosing
your definition of the sines,

00:34:01.730 --> 00:34:04.020
you could force that
all the sines satisfy

00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:06.082
this derivative condition.

00:34:06.082 --> 00:34:12.021
OK, so, rescale your coordinates
so that ends up with pi over 2,

00:34:12.021 --> 00:34:13.770
an all sides of
everything and pi over two

00:34:13.770 --> 00:34:17.130
is always zero, the
derivative, so you're good.

00:34:17.130 --> 00:34:20.019
So, you can do some
clever trickiness

00:34:20.019 --> 00:34:21.810
to try to make the
problem easier to solve.

00:34:21.810 --> 00:34:25.050
And so, that's one whole
branch of these basis function

00:34:25.050 --> 00:34:27.570
methods, is clever
basis functions

00:34:27.570 --> 00:34:30.239
to match the special
problem you have.

00:34:30.239 --> 00:34:30.820
OK?

00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:33.510
So that's one option.

00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:36.844
Then, the other option is
the non-clever approach,

00:34:36.844 --> 00:34:38.760
where you just say, well,
I've got a computer.

00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:39.968
Who cares about being clever?

00:34:39.968 --> 00:34:41.460
Let's just brute force it.

00:34:41.460 --> 00:34:41.961
All right.

00:34:41.961 --> 00:34:44.168
And instead, you just want
to write a general method,

00:34:44.168 --> 00:34:45.270
any problem you can solve.

00:34:45.270 --> 00:34:47.020
And this is more or
less what COMSOL does.

00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:49.100
And you're going to do it.

00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:52.750
And so the distinction
here is that this kind

00:34:52.750 --> 00:34:56.620
of thing, this sine function,
has a value everywhere, all

00:34:56.620 --> 00:34:57.781
across the domain.

00:34:57.781 --> 00:34:59.530
So this is kind of
like a global function.

00:35:05.571 --> 00:35:06.070
OK?

00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:11.570
And the alternative
is to do local basis.

00:35:11.570 --> 00:35:13.480
Try to have basis
functions that are only

00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:15.547
defined in little tiny areas.

00:35:15.547 --> 00:35:17.630
And then, at least when I
integrate the integrals,

00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:19.140
I don't have to integrate
over the whole range.

00:35:19.140 --> 00:35:19.820
I don't have to have
to integrate right

00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:21.180
around my little basis function.

00:35:24.314 --> 00:35:26.980
So, this global basis function--
this is sort of similar to what

00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:28.104
we're doing, interpolation?

00:35:28.104 --> 00:35:30.520
Do you remember you could
use high order polynomial

00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:34.030
to interpolate, or you
could alternatively

00:35:34.030 --> 00:35:36.960
do a little piecewise
interpolations,

00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:39.820
say, with straight lines
between your points.

00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:43.150
And, you know, it's
not so clear, actually,

00:35:43.150 --> 00:35:44.770
which would be the
best way to do it.

00:35:44.770 --> 00:35:45.820
Or maybe you want to
do some combination.

00:35:45.820 --> 00:35:47.569
Do little parabolas
between little triples

00:35:47.569 --> 00:35:48.610
of points, or something.

00:35:48.610 --> 00:35:52.060
That might be a good
interpolation procedure.

00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:53.530
It's the same thing here.

00:35:53.530 --> 00:35:56.770
Some problems, you can find
a global basis set that works

00:35:56.770 --> 00:35:59.110
great and you should use it.

00:35:59.110 --> 00:36:00.880
In other problems
you might do better

00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:03.130
to just break up the domain
in little tiny pieces

00:36:03.130 --> 00:36:06.290
and then do simple little
polynomials or something

00:36:06.290 --> 00:36:08.036
in those little domains.

00:36:08.036 --> 00:36:09.684
All right.

00:36:09.684 --> 00:36:10.850
So this is the global basis.

00:36:10.850 --> 00:36:12.730
Let's see a local basis.

00:36:17.795 --> 00:36:19.290
It's OK to delete this?

00:36:30.650 --> 00:36:33.655
So, local basis functions.

00:36:39.672 --> 00:36:44.272
A really common choice for
these guys are the b-splines.

00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:49.690
And, in particular,
first order of b-splines

00:36:49.690 --> 00:36:56.085
and these functions have
the shape phi phi k,

00:36:56.085 --> 00:36:57.090
it looks like this.

00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:20.190
So, at zero, all the
way up to ti minus 1.

00:37:20.190 --> 00:37:23.860
Then it goes up to
one at ti, and then it

00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:27.930
goes down to zero
again, and goes out.

00:37:27.930 --> 00:37:28.430
OK.

00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:30.110
So this function is a b-spline.

00:37:30.110 --> 00:37:33.110
It's also called a tent function
because it looks like a tent.

00:37:33.110 --> 00:37:34.700
Some people call
it a hat function.

00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:36.920
I don't have a pointy head so it
doesn't look like a hat to me,

00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:38.670
but they call it a hat
function so I guess

00:37:38.670 --> 00:37:42.260
they must have hats like that.

00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:45.260
And this is a very
common basis set.

00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:48.560
And the nice thing about
this basis function

00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:54.198
is, it's zero except in this
little tiny domain around it.

00:37:54.198 --> 00:37:55.540
OK?

00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:59.310
And it's the only basis
function in the whole set that

00:37:59.310 --> 00:38:01.960
has a non-zero value of ti.

00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:04.820
And so if you want the function
to equal something in ti,

00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:07.190
it's going to be equal to
the coefficient of this basis

00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:07.856
function, right?

00:38:07.856 --> 00:38:11.630
Because we're going
to write y n of t

00:38:11.630 --> 00:38:17.960
is equal to summation
[? dnk ?] phi k of t.

00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:23.500
And so, if I really care
about yn evaluated at ti,

00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:27.610
the only one basis function
this whole sum is going

00:38:27.610 --> 00:38:29.240
to have a non-zero value there.

00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:37.070
So that's going to
be equal to dn dnk, k

00:38:37.070 --> 00:38:40.031
where this is the special k.

00:38:40.031 --> 00:38:42.625
k prime matches up to ti.

00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:47.130
OK, so there's one base
function that looks like this.

00:38:47.130 --> 00:38:50.870
There's another one
over here that's

00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:52.760
the one base center
on this point,

00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:54.630
and there's another
one over here.

00:38:54.630 --> 00:38:56.354
So on this point,
it's [INAUDIBLE]..

00:38:56.354 --> 00:38:58.520
And I have as many basis
functions as I have points.

00:39:01.070 --> 00:39:04.610
So this is like a way I
discretize the problem,

00:39:04.610 --> 00:39:09.030
but I've kept my solution
as continuous function

00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:10.820
because my y--

00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:12.650
that's the sum of these guys--

00:39:12.650 --> 00:39:14.490
has a value everywhere.

00:39:14.490 --> 00:39:16.487
It's a continuous function.

00:39:16.487 --> 00:39:18.570
The way this is written
it looks like it might not

00:39:18.570 --> 00:39:20.850
be differentiable
at all the points

00:39:20.850 --> 00:39:23.640
because it has all
these kinks, but there's

00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:27.660
a clever trick you can do
to deal with the kinks.

00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:30.264
So, actually, it's
not a problem.

00:39:30.264 --> 00:39:32.122
AUDIENCE: So, for
these basis functions,

00:39:32.122 --> 00:39:34.080
how would you define if
you had the boundaries?

00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:35.821
Like t0?

00:39:35.821 --> 00:39:38.320
PROFESSOR: So, you'll have a
basis function at the very end.

00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:40.460
Suppose this is t0 here.

00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:43.940
You have one like that.

00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:46.830
OK, so it's just
a half of a tent.

00:39:46.830 --> 00:39:49.250
Can you get a
[? sparse ?] d-matrix?

00:39:49.250 --> 00:39:49.920
Yes.

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:51.710
So locality is really
good because it

00:39:51.710 --> 00:39:56.690
makes the Jacobian matrix
sparse, the overall problem.

00:39:56.690 --> 00:40:02.510
So, when I compute the
integrals of this thing,

00:40:02.510 --> 00:40:14.160
for example, the integral of phi
i of t, phi i minus 1 of t dt,

00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:19.880
this turns out to be equal
to 1 or 2 times ti minus ti

00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:20.880
[INAUDIBLE].

00:40:23.863 --> 00:40:26.280
No.

00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:27.100
I take that back.

00:40:27.100 --> 00:40:29.150
Just one half.

00:40:29.150 --> 00:40:31.920
Just half.

00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:35.750
So it is like a brilliant thing.

00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:36.820
Is that right?

00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:39.550
It does have a ti [INAUDIBLE],,
not a [INAUDIBLE]..

00:40:39.550 --> 00:40:40.960
I'll have to double check.

00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:43.190
Possibly including delta t.

00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:45.050
I can't remember.

00:40:45.050 --> 00:40:47.800
All right.

00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:51.760
But the integrals
are very analytical,

00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:54.490
and only certain
ones are non-zero.

00:40:54.490 --> 00:41:00.790
So only one that the two is when
the two is differ by one unit,

00:41:00.790 --> 00:41:02.260
do they have a
non-zero integral?

00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:03.718
All the rest of
them are non-zeros.

00:41:03.718 --> 00:41:05.350
So, when I write
down these equations,

00:41:05.350 --> 00:41:07.414
I mean, many, many,
many, many zeros,

00:41:07.414 --> 00:41:09.580
so it looks horrible when
I write Galerkin's method,

00:41:09.580 --> 00:41:11.871
I get so many integrals, but
actually a zillion of them

00:41:11.871 --> 00:41:15.550
are zero, and then there's
a bunch of special tricks

00:41:15.550 --> 00:41:19.900
I can do that make it
even better than that.

00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:22.210
OK?

00:41:22.210 --> 00:41:23.810
So then, the Jacobian sparse.

00:41:23.810 --> 00:41:27.130
So, that'll save you a lot of
time in linear algebra, which

00:41:27.130 --> 00:41:28.575
allows you use a lot of points.

00:41:28.575 --> 00:41:31.585
So, you can use a very large
basis set because you end up

00:41:31.585 --> 00:41:33.210
with sparse Jacobians,
I mean, it's not

00:41:33.210 --> 00:41:35.350
going to fill your memory
storing all the elements

00:41:35.350 --> 00:41:38.270
in the Jacobian, even if the
number of points is very large.

00:41:38.270 --> 00:41:42.930
And also, there's vast numerical
solution methods for those.

00:41:42.930 --> 00:41:46.650
So that's the idea of this.

00:41:46.650 --> 00:41:49.800
I guess should we try to
carry one of these out?

00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:52.050
You guys are [INAUDIBLE]
trying to do a lot of algebra

00:41:52.050 --> 00:41:53.124
on the board?

00:41:53.124 --> 00:41:55.520
Do you think I can do
the algebra on the board?

00:41:55.520 --> 00:41:57.710
That's the real question.

00:41:57.710 --> 00:41:58.210
All right.

00:42:22.907 --> 00:42:24.490
Should I do it for
collocation, or you

00:42:24.490 --> 00:42:27.390
guys confident you
can do collocation?

00:42:27.390 --> 00:42:30.292
You're all right
with collocation?

00:42:30.292 --> 00:42:31.500
You're fine with collocation.

00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:32.290
Great.

00:42:32.290 --> 00:42:33.200
OK.

00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:36.320
So we'll just go
right into Galerkin.

00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:38.076
So, Galerkin.

00:42:38.076 --> 00:42:39.605
That way, we use a local basis.

00:42:45.860 --> 00:42:50.450
So, most of the equations we
have to solve are this type.

00:42:50.450 --> 00:43:05.720
Phi j t times the residual
function of summation [? dnk ?]

00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:06.833
phi k prime.

00:43:12.990 --> 00:43:21.720
Summation [? dnk ?]
of phi k and t.

00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:22.540
Is equal to zero.

00:43:22.540 --> 00:43:24.540
All right, we have a lot
of equations like that.

00:43:24.540 --> 00:43:26.610
We're trying to
find the d's that

00:43:26.610 --> 00:43:30.760
are going to force all
these integrals to be zero.

00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:31.260
OK?

00:43:31.260 --> 00:43:35.290
So we have a lot of different
j's we're going to try.

00:43:35.290 --> 00:43:38.430
We want this to be
true for all the n's.

00:43:38.430 --> 00:43:41.580
And then we're going to adjust
these [? dnk's ?] to try

00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:44.260
to force this to be zero.

00:43:44.260 --> 00:43:44.760
All right?

00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:45.920
That's the main problem.

00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:47.294
And then, on top
of this, there's

00:43:47.294 --> 00:43:49.054
some equations with
boundary conditions.

00:43:52.330 --> 00:43:56.600
So, now we have to look
at what the form is.

00:43:56.600 --> 00:44:01.380
If the form is, oh, I erased
it, if I can make this explicit

00:44:01.380 --> 00:44:05.640
in the derivatives, which
I can do very often,

00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:16.210
for example, this could
be dyn/dt minus [? fm. ?]

00:44:16.210 --> 00:44:20.800
So then, dyn/dt is just this.

00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:23.300
And then I'll have another term,
[? fm, ?] which will depend

00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:25.890
on that [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:25.890 --> 00:44:31.380
And so the integral
phi j, and I'll just

00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:43.170
remind you that phi j
is not equal to zero.

00:44:43.170 --> 00:44:52.821
If tj minus 1 is
less than tj plus 1.

00:44:52.821 --> 00:44:53.320
All right.

00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:56.290
That's the only places
where my local basis

00:44:56.290 --> 00:44:58.040
function is non-zero.

00:44:58.040 --> 00:44:59.660
That's where the tent is.

00:44:59.660 --> 00:45:01.790
And all the rest of it's zero.

00:45:01.790 --> 00:45:03.920
So when I have this
integral, originally have it

00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:07.680
t0 to t-final, but
actually I could replace

00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:12.466
this with tj minus 1 to tj.

00:45:12.466 --> 00:45:13.840
And it's just the same.

00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:16.330
Because of all the integral
outside that domain is zero.

00:45:16.330 --> 00:45:18.460
Because this function is zero.

00:45:18.460 --> 00:45:18.970
All right?

00:45:18.970 --> 00:45:20.636
So at least I have a
small little domain

00:45:20.636 --> 00:45:22.577
to do the integral over.

00:45:22.577 --> 00:45:25.815
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] tj?

00:45:25.815 --> 00:45:26.690
PROFESSOR: tj plus 1.

00:45:26.690 --> 00:45:28.370
Thank you.

00:45:28.370 --> 00:45:28.955
Yes.

00:45:28.955 --> 00:45:29.460
Yes.

00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:29.960
Plus 1.

00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:31.696
Yes.

00:45:31.696 --> 00:45:34.160
Is that all right?

00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:34.870
OK.

00:45:34.870 --> 00:45:36.550
So, I have this
integral, and then

00:45:36.550 --> 00:45:43.005
I have this times the
derivative term, so it's dnk

00:45:43.005 --> 00:45:50.792
dk prime minus the same
integral, j minus 1.

00:45:50.792 --> 00:45:52.480
J plus 1.

00:45:52.480 --> 00:46:01.348
Phi j sorry [? fm ?]
[INAUDIBLE] summation of dn.

00:46:01.348 --> 00:46:03.828
k phi.

00:46:03.828 --> 00:46:05.316
k [INAUDIBLE] t.

00:46:11.264 --> 00:46:11.764
OK.

00:46:14.740 --> 00:46:21.395
Now, this derivative
of phi k, well, I just

00:46:21.395 --> 00:46:22.270
told you what it was.

00:46:22.270 --> 00:46:25.330
It's just like the
[INAUDIBLE] set functions.

00:46:25.330 --> 00:46:28.600
So, this integral,
you'll know analytically.

00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:32.590
Like, it's either 0 or it's 1/2.

00:46:32.590 --> 00:46:34.090
Maybe minus 1/2.

00:46:34.090 --> 00:46:35.920
Whatever, but it's
nothing complicated,

00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:37.670
and you'll just know
it right off the bat.

00:46:37.670 --> 00:46:40.300
So this is all
that can be known.

00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:41.260
And sparse.

00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:45.517
It's only going to be when k is
equal to j minus 1 or j plus 1

00:46:45.517 --> 00:46:47.600
that this will be non-zero,
and all the rest of it

00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:49.424
would be zero.

00:46:49.424 --> 00:46:50.380
OK?

00:46:50.380 --> 00:46:52.600
So, that's mostly zeros.

00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:56.850
This one over
here, in principle,

00:46:56.850 --> 00:47:00.511
I have quite a huge sum
here, k equals 1 to k,

00:47:00.511 --> 00:47:02.010
where I have all
my basis functions,

00:47:02.010 --> 00:47:05.610
which is all my points where
I put my little tents down.

00:47:05.610 --> 00:47:09.010
So I have a domain and
I've parked a lot of tents

00:47:09.010 --> 00:47:11.310
all on the domain, that's
my basis functions.

00:47:11.310 --> 00:47:12.060
And I'm trying to
figure out, sort of,

00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:13.635
how high the tent poles are.

00:47:13.635 --> 00:47:15.350
On all those tents.

00:47:15.350 --> 00:47:17.920
And my tunnel functions, the
sum of all the heights of those

00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:18.669
tents.

00:47:18.669 --> 00:47:19.168
OK?

00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:25.770
But this guy is only non-zero
in this little domain,

00:47:25.770 --> 00:47:30.766
and these guys, most of them
are zero in that domain,

00:47:30.766 --> 00:47:33.140
because they're mostly tents
that are far away from where

00:47:33.140 --> 00:47:35.440
my special tent phi j is.

00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:37.990
OK, so I'm going
to draw a picture.

00:47:37.990 --> 00:47:43.730
Here's the domain
from t0 to t-final.

00:47:43.730 --> 00:47:47.060
Over here is my tent
corresponding to phi j,

00:47:47.060 --> 00:47:50.590
which is centered around tj.

00:47:50.590 --> 00:47:52.780
Hence, this function.

00:47:52.780 --> 00:47:55.280
And then, these guys
are all the other tents.

00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:57.350
There's a tent here,
there's a tent like this,

00:47:57.350 --> 00:47:59.641
there's another tent like
this, another tent like this.

00:47:59.641 --> 00:48:00.556
All these tents.

00:48:00.556 --> 00:48:01.930
Those are all the
basis functions

00:48:01.930 --> 00:48:05.020
starting from k
equals 1 and going up.

00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:08.400
All of these guys are zero in
this domain because they all

00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:10.440
have zero tail.

00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:14.070
So, almost all of these,
the f's doesn't really

00:48:14.070 --> 00:48:15.840
pick up anything from
any of those guys

00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:17.080
in the domain I care about.

00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:19.830
The only domain I care about
is this domain right here.

00:48:19.830 --> 00:48:24.080
And this whole sum is all zero
except for a few special k's

00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:28.830
when k is equal to j
minus 1, j, or j plus 1.

00:48:28.830 --> 00:48:31.182
So I only have to worry
about three terms.

00:48:31.182 --> 00:48:34.900
The inside contributing to
the y in the region of t

00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:36.893
that I care about.

00:48:36.893 --> 00:48:38.820
All right?

00:48:38.820 --> 00:48:44.850
So, when I want to compute
the Jacobian with respect

00:48:44.850 --> 00:48:49.540
to d, the only terms here
where the Jacobian's going

00:48:49.540 --> 00:48:59.350
to be non-zero are for d
I have a Jacobian, which

00:48:59.350 --> 00:49:05.190
is the derivative of
this whole thing, ddd nk.

00:49:05.190 --> 00:49:06.140
Right?

00:49:06.140 --> 00:49:17.955
And that's only non-zero if
k is equal to j minus 1 j,

00:49:17.955 --> 00:49:19.440
or j plus 1.

00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:27.017
You guys see that?

00:49:27.017 --> 00:49:28.350
How many people do not see this?

00:49:31.722 --> 00:49:32.805
How many people are lying?

00:49:36.300 --> 00:49:40.130
This is a really important
concept for the locality,

00:49:40.130 --> 00:49:41.880
so this is the advantage
of a local basis,

00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:43.421
that the Jacobian
will turn out to be

00:49:43.421 --> 00:49:46.830
really sparse because it's only
non-zero in this special case.

00:49:46.830 --> 00:49:50.660
And you might have
1,000 points, 1,000

00:49:50.660 --> 00:49:53.740
of these little tent, 1,000
basis functions in the sum.

00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:55.782
But only three of
them are non-zero.

00:49:55.782 --> 00:49:58.610
For four each n.

00:49:58.610 --> 00:50:00.490
So, actually, it's 3 times n.

00:50:00.490 --> 00:50:03.180
[INAUDIBLE] non-zero.

00:50:03.180 --> 00:50:04.720
Is that all right?

00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:07.210
Because it just
depends on the k.

00:50:07.210 --> 00:50:09.050
Three of the ks are non-zero.

00:50:09.050 --> 00:50:11.954
There's 1,000 of these
guys [INAUDIBLE]..

00:50:11.954 --> 00:50:13.790
Yep.

00:50:13.790 --> 00:50:17.000
So that's the big
trick of locality.

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:19.250
And then, also, because
these integration ranges

00:50:19.250 --> 00:50:22.220
are so small, because you
choose your points really finely

00:50:22.220 --> 00:50:25.670
spaced, then you might get
away with simple polynomial

00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:29.176
expansions of f, for example.

00:50:29.176 --> 00:50:31.050
Around the points, or
[INAUDIBLE] expansions,

00:50:31.050 --> 00:50:32.610
there are all kinds
of little tricks.

00:50:32.610 --> 00:50:35.910
Or you could even do quadrature
and determine some points,

00:50:35.910 --> 00:50:38.682
do a [INAUDIBLE] quadrature
to evaluate the integral.

00:50:38.682 --> 00:50:40.682
But you only need a few
points, because you know

00:50:40.682 --> 00:50:43.570
it's a little tiny range of dt.

00:50:43.570 --> 00:50:46.870
And you would hope that
you've chosen so many fees, so

00:50:46.870 --> 00:50:49.690
many time points, that
your function doesn't

00:50:49.690 --> 00:50:52.450
change much from one
time point to the next.

00:50:52.450 --> 00:50:55.409
So, more or less, first
order is constant.

00:50:55.409 --> 00:50:56.950
Your function's
constant with respect

00:50:56.950 --> 00:50:59.710
to t in this little tiny
domain, and then maybe

00:50:59.710 --> 00:51:00.850
has a little slope.

00:51:00.850 --> 00:51:02.520
And then, if you're
really being fancy,

00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:04.270
you might be able to
put a parabola on it.

00:51:04.270 --> 00:51:05.440
But it's not going
to change that much.

00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:07.330
If it's changing a
lot, that's telling you

00:51:07.330 --> 00:51:08.705
you don't have
enough time points

00:51:08.705 --> 00:51:11.274
and you should go back and put
some more basis functions in.

00:51:11.274 --> 00:51:12.550
And then you can get
a good [INAUDIBLE]..

00:51:12.550 --> 00:51:14.091
Because what we're,
really doing here

00:51:14.091 --> 00:51:16.240
is we're using this basis set.

00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:18.970
If I add up these guys,
what I'm really doing

00:51:18.970 --> 00:51:21.040
is piecewise linear
interpolation

00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:22.900
between all the points.

00:51:22.900 --> 00:51:28.512
So I'm approximating
my y versus time.

00:51:28.512 --> 00:51:29.720
It's going to look like this.

00:51:37.390 --> 00:51:37.890
All right.

00:51:37.890 --> 00:51:39.910
It's piecewise
linear, because that's

00:51:39.910 --> 00:51:41.660
the only thing you can
make from adding up

00:51:41.660 --> 00:51:43.100
a bunch of straight
line segments.

00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:45.080
A bunch of tents is a
bunch of straight lines.

00:51:45.080 --> 00:51:48.410
And so this is what the
approximate function is.

00:51:48.410 --> 00:51:50.390
Well, you can see,
this is really bad

00:51:50.390 --> 00:51:52.050
if these functions are too
different from each other.

00:51:52.050 --> 00:51:53.300
But if they're all like this--

00:52:01.292 --> 00:52:02.750
and you think,
well, maybe it's not

00:52:02.750 --> 00:52:05.310
so bad to use piecewise linear.

00:52:05.310 --> 00:52:06.024
Yeah.

00:52:06.024 --> 00:52:09.190
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
confused at where

00:52:09.190 --> 00:52:11.900
we're using [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:13.981
PROFESSOR: Inside
[? f ?] solve, what

00:52:13.981 --> 00:52:16.760
is trying to solve
for the d's, it's

00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:21.270
solving each of this giant set
of the equations, a whole lot

00:52:21.270 --> 00:52:25.840
of equations like this, they
all come in to a gigantic f.

00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:28.914
That's the f of d that need
to make equal to to zero.

00:52:28.914 --> 00:52:30.330
And so, I'm
[? burying ?] the d's,

00:52:30.330 --> 00:52:32.780
I need the Jacobian
of that gigantic f.

00:52:32.780 --> 00:52:35.390
Now, the problem,
because it's gigantic,

00:52:35.390 --> 00:52:38.630
I need a lot of points, a
lot of closely spaced points

00:52:38.630 --> 00:52:40.700
to make my function look smooth.

00:52:40.700 --> 00:52:43.500
That means the number of base
functions is really huge.

00:52:43.500 --> 00:52:47.180
So the Jacobian principle
is huge number squared.

00:52:47.180 --> 00:52:50.510
I have 1,000 points, say,
discretizing my domain.

00:52:50.510 --> 00:52:52.176
And then it's 1,000
by 1,000 Jacobian.

00:52:52.176 --> 00:52:54.800
It might be really hard to solve
it, or cost a lot of CPU time,

00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:56.180
or use a lot of memory.

00:52:56.180 --> 00:52:58.940
But, fortunately, almost
all the elements are zero.

00:52:58.940 --> 00:53:03.130
So, it's like, has a
sparsity of 0.3% or something

00:53:03.130 --> 00:53:05.030
is the occupancy.

00:53:05.030 --> 00:53:06.770
So, it's almost all
completely sparse,

00:53:06.770 --> 00:53:10.560
and therefore you can solve
it even though it's gigantic.

00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:11.750
Yes.

00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:16.170
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
basis function [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:16.170 --> 00:53:24.104
the Jacobian [INAUDIBLE]
should be [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:24.104 --> 00:53:25.520
PROFESSOR: We're
trying to find d,

00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:29.800
so we're really trying
to solve a problem that's

00:53:29.800 --> 00:53:34.440
f of d is equal to zero.

00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:37.060
That's our fundamental
problem we're trying to solve.

00:53:37.060 --> 00:53:38.490
We're doing Galerkin.

00:53:38.490 --> 00:53:40.745
We have something equal to
zero, and it depends on d.

00:53:40.745 --> 00:53:42.120
And we're trying
to find the d's.

00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:44.660
So this is really the function
we're trying to solve.

00:53:44.660 --> 00:53:46.410
In order to evaluate
the elements in this,

00:53:46.410 --> 00:53:48.000
we have to compute a
whole bunch of integrals

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:49.041
with the Galerkin method.

00:53:49.041 --> 00:53:50.452
So that's the complexity.

00:53:50.452 --> 00:53:52.410
But the basis functions,
we know what they are.

00:53:52.410 --> 00:53:54.360
We've pre-specified them.

00:53:54.360 --> 00:53:57.560
So, the whole question
is just what the d's are.

00:53:57.560 --> 00:54:01.830
And the d's get multiplied
by a whole lot of integrals.

00:54:01.830 --> 00:54:03.200
Is this all right?

00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:06.112
I think I may have
misunderstood the question.

00:54:06.112 --> 00:54:07.570
So you have f of
d is [INAUDIBLE],,

00:54:07.570 --> 00:54:10.400
so therefore we probably want
to know j with respect to d.

00:54:15.080 --> 00:54:16.980
OK.

00:54:16.980 --> 00:54:19.980
Time ran out before
clarity was achieved.

00:54:19.980 --> 00:54:22.890
We'll try to achieve clarity
on Wednesday morning.
