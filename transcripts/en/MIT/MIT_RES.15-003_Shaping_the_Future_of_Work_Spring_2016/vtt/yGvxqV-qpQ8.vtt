00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.350
Welcome to the second
week of our class

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:08.850
on shaping the future of work.

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.090
We got off to a
great start last week

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.800
with lots of good discussions
on the future of work,

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.830
on your hopes, your aspirations.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.750
A lot of discussion about
the future of technology

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.420
and how it's going to affect
work and some of the worries

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.380
that many of you
have about this.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.540
So we'll continue
these discussions

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.660
we'll go into more
depth on technology

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.040
and work down the way in about
the fourth week of class.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.060
But to give you a preview,
I posted a new note

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.730
on the discussion board
about a big new MIT project

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.730
on the future of the technology
in textiles, of all industries.

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.800
We are about to
start a big project

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.390
to see if we can put some
of the ideas of this course

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.840
to work in practice, where we
shape the future of the textile

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.660
and fabric industry
with high technology

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.890
jobs, hopefully,
good quality jobs,

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.490
with new training programs.

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:02.230
So take a look at that post.

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.070
See if you have thoughts on how
we can shape the future of work

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.010
in that particular sector.

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.060
But this week, we'll
do three things.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.590
First, the videos that
are posted for this week

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.310
will give you a bit of a history
of how the social contract

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.710
played out and worked well in
the United States and, in fact,

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.650
in some other countries
around the world in the past.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.900
We do this not to try to repeat
history but to spring forward

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.970
on the basis of a good
understanding of where we've

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.180
come from and what we
need to do to build

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.110
a new social contract--

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.090
a good foundation for
building a new social contract

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.440
in the future.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.860
Second, this week we're
going to introduce

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.380
some new regional
discussion facilitators.

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.460
Our MBAs from the class
I'm teaching here on campus

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.270
are from all over the world.

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.220
From China, from South
Asia, from Africa,

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.490
from northern
Europe, from Brazil.

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.000
They will host
discussions about how

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.230
the issues we're
talking about play out

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.300
in your regions of
the world, and we

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.790
ask those of you who
are from those areas

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.130
to join that conversation.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.740
We'll even have some new
experts from Australia.

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.280
Some colleagues of mine in
the universities over there

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.330
who study and work
on these issues.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.010
So I think we'll have a full
body discussion about how

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.440
the changing nature
of work is playing out

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.760
in different parts
of our planet.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.190
To get things started on
your personal career process,

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.740
this week, there's
an assignment that

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.790
will take you step by
step through a process

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.440
of identifying the
kinds of issues

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.570
that you're interested
in, you have some aptitude

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.370
toward, and then the kind
of educational levels

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.920
that are available to get
access to the jobs in fields

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:49.940
of interest to you.

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.740
So get started by going
to the assignment page,

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.250
start that process.

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.700
It'll carry through over
the next several weeks,

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.430
and it's accompanied
by several videos

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.700
around the role
of education, it's

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.880
changing role in
lifelong learning,

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.680
and a special video by our
colleague, Lee Dyer, who

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.040
talks about the skills
and competencies needed

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.920
for the jobs of the future.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.590
So that's what
we'll do this week.

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.410
But before we finish
here, let's take

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.020
a look at what you told us
last week about your goals

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.560
and your aspirations for work.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.040
Here's the results
of the poll that you

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.370
filled in about
your top priority

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.990
for your work and your career.

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.420
Notice that the
top item comes out

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.300
to be having a good
work life balance,

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.250
followed very closely
by having a big impact

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.610
on problems that are important
to you and to society.

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.370
And then in third place
but not too far behind

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.450
is the desire to have a
good living from your work

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:55.710
experiences.

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:59.120
These are the same top three
items that your colleagues

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.110
last year indicated were
their top priorities,

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.880
although this year,
the work life balance

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.850
became a little bit
higher in the ranking.

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.960
So it's very clear that
you want many things out

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.120
of your jobs and your careers.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.940
Unlike your parents,
as many of you

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.079
told us who focused over
here on earning a good living

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.250
and having a stable
job, you want

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.690
to be able to both have
a big impact on work.

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.750
You want to have a
good work life balance

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.000
so you can have a
good opportunity

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.870
to raise your children and
be a good spouse at home

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.730
or a partner at home and
also earn a good living.

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:40.380
So let's focus on
how we do that.

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.870
Let me give you a
couple of examples

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.130
of the rich way in
which you embodied

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:50.230
these rankings in the range
of comments in the exercise

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:53.390
around comparing your goals
with those of your parents.

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:56.300
This one, I think,
captures the essence

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.210
of what the poll told us.

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:02.530
As one of you said, "I dream
of a well-balanced work family

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:05.600
environment, where I
can develop my skills

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.970
put them to service
for my community,

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:10.050
and as well get a
wage that allows

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:12.600
me to have a decent
life so that I

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.330
can provide for my
family and my offspring."

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.220
Or this one, "My
dream is to change

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.100
the world by contributing
something meaningful to it.

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.810
While maintaining a
balanced lifestyle,

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:25.940
I consider myself
a global citizen."

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:28.430
This is something that a
number of you mentioned.

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:32.350
That you wanted to work and
live in a culturally diverse yet

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:35.250
an integrated workplace
and lifestyle,

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:39.840
and that you want to push
your children to be curious

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.090
about their world and to
push the limits of what

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:46.230
they can do as they grow up.

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:49.400
Here's another one
that says, particularly

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.520
about young millennials
and their interest

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.750
in working with the
digital revolution.

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:58.230
"My dream is to be part of
the digital revolution driven

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:01.410
by millennials working
at innovative companies,"

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:05.180
and "to make the world a
better place to live and work."

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:06.840
That theme comes through again.

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.930
And then finally, "I want
to earn a living wage

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:13.300
and not have to miss my
children growing up."

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.470
This is the world of
work that you aspire to.

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:18.120
This is the world
of work that we

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.540
have to create moving forward.

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:22.190
So let's get on with the task.

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:26.270
This week, we'll focus
on your responsibilities

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:29.370
to make sure that you
are prepared to have

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:31.620
the right educational
levels to achieve

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:34.060
your goals and your
aspirations, and then we'll

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:37.280
also look at what
made the world of work

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:41.060
more effective in sometimes
in the past in our countries

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:43.530
so that we can spring
forward to think

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:45.960
about how we build
a new foundation

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.950
for the future of work.
