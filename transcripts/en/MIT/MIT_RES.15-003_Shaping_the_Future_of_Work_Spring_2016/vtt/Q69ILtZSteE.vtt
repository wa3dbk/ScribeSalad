00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.610
Welcome to our fifth week of
Shaping the Future of Work.

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.010
My name is Christine Riordan,
and I am a PhD student here

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.510
at the Institute for Work and
Employment Research at MIT.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:17.530
I'm filling in for
Professor Kochan

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:21.410
this morning, who you will
hear from later in the week.

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.850
There are two items that
we want to highlight as we

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.750
start this week of the course.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.880
One is our upcoming topic
regarding worker voice

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.390
and good quality
jobs in the context

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.790
of changing forms of work.

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.440
The second is something
we're really excited about,

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.390
which is a simulated negotiation
over the future social contract

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.090
at work, something that you will
be participating in next week,

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.690
and which really brings all
of the ideas and this course

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.590
together in a very concrete way.

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.740
So this week, we're
going to get you set up

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.410
for that negotiation.

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.100
But first, our focus on
worker voice and advocacy.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.380
So last week, we heard from
a number of individuals

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.500
about new arrangements
and forms of work,

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.800
whether it be new
patterns of job growth,

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.780
the organization of
work through technology,

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.350
or new strategies
in entrepreneurship.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.170
From the discussion
boards, these

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.900
seem to be topics that
resonate with your thinking

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.620
about the future of work, not
only in terms of your own jobs

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.320
or careers, but also in the
bigger picture of the labor

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.410
market.

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.880
Within this realm, the
issue of job quality

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.320
is front and center.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.130
So these two things,
changing forms

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.500
of work and good
employment practices,

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.470
are critical to our upcoming
module on worker voice

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:39.810
and advocacy.

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.960
We're going to extend
this discussion

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.690
to consider how worker voice
and organizing are changing

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.690
as new forms of organizing
work are emerging.

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.150
To do so, we're going
to first discuss

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.480
the decline in union
membership, a traditional means

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.830
of exercising voice on the job.

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.860
We'll identify some of
the ways in which new work

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.400
arrangements are challenging
voice and job quality.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.250
We'll then talk about how new
forms of worker organizing

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.720
are starting to adapt to
these changes and challenges.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.610
Firms, as we'll see, are
also making decisions

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.000
on how they integrate new ways
of doing work, such as those

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.200
brought by technology, in
ways that maintain good job

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.400
standards.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.940
However, we want
to take a moment

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.250
to emphasize an
important point that

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.120
puts these discussions
in a broader context.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.930
In a number of our
videos and discussions,

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.940
we've talked about
alternative work arrangements

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.680
such as freelancing
or contracting,

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.330
and on-demand, or gig, jobs.

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.150
According to a recent study
by US economists Lawrence Katz

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.160
and Alan Krueger, such
alternative arrangements

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.330
have grown, most notably
in the last 10 years,

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.960
and now account for about
15% of workers' jobs

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.570
throughout the US.

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.420
This growth in the
visibility of arrangements

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.410
like those of the
on-demand economy

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.450
are bringing renewed attention
to related labor market

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:06.750
challenges.

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.970
Still, some of
these arrangements

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.550
make up a relatively
small portion of jobs.

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.270
The on-demand
economy, for instance,

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.310
accounted for less than
1% of total employment

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.860
in 2015, according
to Katz and Krueger.

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.980
So given this, there
are really two tasks

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.840
at hand in this week's agenda.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.220
One, as we've stated, is to
understand emerging forms

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.480
of voice that overcome
some of the challenges

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.080
in these arrangements.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.200
In our videos and
Additional Resource section,

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.520
you'll see inspiring
examples and accounts of how

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.705
change is being achieved.

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.680
The second task is
to critically examine

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.870
what these new
challenges are telling us

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.910
about the overall labor market.

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.340
Encouragingly, we have
arrived at a point where

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.280
we are engaging in public
discourse about issues

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.480
like the rights of
independent contractors

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.120
with on-demand companies
like Uber or TaskRabbit.

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.280
One way to think
about this discourse

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.050
is that it provides a
window, or a way in,

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:08.710
to thinking about the challenges
found throughout the labor

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:12.620
market and experienced by
workers across the board,

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.230
whether in an alternative
arrangement or not.

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:19.950
So given this, the
question we ask becomes,

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.950
how can we take the ideas
and the proposals and lessons

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.080
we learned from
these emerging forms

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.830
and use those to think
critically about solutions

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.140
to challenges and the need
for a stronger role of worker

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.690
voice across different
segments of the labor market,

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.650
like those discussed by Bureau
of Labor Statistics chief

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.190
economist Heidi
Shierholz last week?

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.890
Doing so places our
thinking in the trajectory

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:44.980
we've been on throughout
this course, which

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:48.030
has focused in recent weeks
on the gradual demise of labor

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.650
market institutions and the
social contract at work.

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.880
We're excited to see
how you're thinking

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.160
about these in the discussion
boards over the coming week.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.490
Now, on to the
negotiation exercise.

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.670
In week six, you'll be engaging
with your course colleagues

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:06.850
in dialogue regarding different
actions and employment

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:09.180
practices that can
serve as building

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.380
blocks for the new
social contract at work.

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.660
To do this, you'll
be assigned to groups

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.760
and will negotiate from the
perspective of a given role,

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.750
including management, labor
unions and professional groups,

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.820
the federal government, or
educational institutions.

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:29.250
The idea behind this is to bring
all of our lessons and material

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.520
together in a
concrete way, but one

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.720
that hinges on your
creativity and participation.

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.880
So the outcome of
the exercise is

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.020
really dependent upon
having as many perspectives

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:43.130
and participants as possible.

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:46.040
This week, you're given basic
information and instructions

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.470
for the negotiation.

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:50.510
You're also asked to
sign up for the exercise

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:52.830
and fill out a short
preparation survey.

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.810
We encourage all of
you, whether you're

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.280
taking the class for
a certificate or not,

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.610
to participate so that we
can collectively really make

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.710
the most out of this
opportunity to think creatively

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:06.940
about the issues we care about.

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:09.520
Next week, you'll receive
your role and your group

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.220
assignments, and we'll
start your negotiations.

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:16.900
On our discussion board, you'll
notice a new thread entitled

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:20.130
"Negotiation Exercise"
where this week and next,

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:23.770
you can post questions or let
us know if you need assistance.

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:26.710
We hope that you'll join
us for the exercise,

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:29.340
and for a live event
presentation in week

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:32.500
seven, the details of
which we'll post soon.

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.620
There we'll talk about
your plans for action.

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.740
So stay tuned. s
