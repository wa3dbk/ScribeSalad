00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:13.080
We can't think of a more
interesting and exciting time

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.740
to launch this course.

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.890
Yes, there are challenges
that you and your peers

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.220
will face because my baby
boom generation didn't

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.120
do a great job of keeping
our policies and practices up

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.250
to date with the changing
economy and the changing

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:28.240
workforce.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.549
But at the same time, we're in
an extremely interesting era

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:34.100
of innovation.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.790
Around the world we're
seeing new organizations

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.010
getting formed
using crowd sourcing

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.170
and other modern techniques,
organizations we couldn't even

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.270
have imagined several years ago.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.930
There are new worker advocacy
organizations coming along

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.410
that will help empower you
to find your way in the labor

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:52.110
market.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.030
There are new apps that allow
you to navigate this labor

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.700
market and to figure out
where the good jobs are

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.770
and distinguish between
good and bad employers.

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.470
And then there are courses
like this exploding

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.690
all around our universities
here in the United States

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:08.720
and in other countries.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.070
We rise and fall on the
strength of our middle class--

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.060
These online courses
allow you to gain access

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.890
to some of the world's
leading experts

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.350
in your particular field.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.160
The role of the corporation in
the US has changed quite a bit.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.380
So it's time to really
bring all of this together

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.880
and see if we can't help really
shape the future of work.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.390
We're going to introduce
you to lots of companies

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.440
that are breaking new ground.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.060
In every industry we
can find great companies

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.940
that are doing well financially,
serving their customers well,

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.560
focused on a mission that is
really important for society

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.220
and providing good jobs.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.840
One of the things we want
to do is to highlight those

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.220
and to learn more about
your own experiences

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.960
with companies and
organizations like this.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.840
And so as we go
along, we're going

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.820
to learn from your
experiences, and you're

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.910
going to meet a
whole set of peers

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:05.210
who have good jobs and maybe
not such good jobs, some mentors

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.419
who are ready to work with
you to provide advice,

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:12.430
and all of that will be a
learning process together.

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.150
And let me say a word about
another piece of this course

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.620
that I'm especially
excited about.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.210
In every week,
we're going to have

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.780
something called the
personal development corner.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.810
This is designed to
provide you with a path

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.880
forward so that you can be
empowered to take control

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.370
of your own career.

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.540
So there'll be
readings and videos

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.070
and exercises and
assignments that allow

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.830
you to understand what are
some of your capabilities, what

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.230
are some of your interests,
what jobs might fit well

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.800
with your background,
and where you would like

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.670
to go with your own
career; and how will

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.310
you develop your own personal
career plan to make sure

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.170
that you are ready
to take advantage

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.160
of the opportunities
that are out there.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.790
So let's start exploring this
evolving and interesting world

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:59.700
of work.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.010
Let's do it with our eyes open.

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.720
Let's understand and
learn from our history

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.880
about what worked in
the past, what's broken,

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.340
what needs to be fixed, and why.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.340
And then let's
see if together we

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.620
can't shape the future of
work for your generation.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.160
So let's get started.
