00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.970
What a busy week we had.

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.550
Because we covered so
much ground this past week

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.930
and because we're almost at
the midpoint of this course,

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:17.130
I thought it would be
useful to summarize

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.980
some of the key
lessons from the week

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.590
and really one of the key
lessons from this course.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.460
That lesson is very simple.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.500
It is that our economies need to
continue to encourage and grow

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.000
what we call high
road firms that

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.640
are both good for
shareholders and for employees

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.570
if we are really to shape
the future of work that

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.230
works for all the
stakeholders in our economy.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.130
How can organizations do this?

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.220
Well, it starts by having a
debate over the basic values

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.950
of the firm.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:50.440
And you did that this week.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.600
You took on the question
of whether this emphasis

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.910
on shareholder value, or what
we called financialization

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.000
view of the firm, is really
the only way in which firms

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.980
can compete.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.019
And you answered
it very clearly.

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.810
You endorsed firms
that should be

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.160
accountable to multiple
stakeholders, to employees,

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.130
to societies, as well
as to their investors

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:17.560
and their owners.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.940
And you noticed that there's a
wide variety of different forms

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.280
that organizations take, both
here in the United States

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.250
and around the world.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.870
And in fact, the US is
one of the few countries

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.490
that emphasizes shareholder
value so heavily.

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.770
You also noted that it not
only varies across countries,

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.790
but even in the US
we didn't always

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.550
put such a heavy emphasis
on shareholder value.

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.200
There was a point in
time when we recognized

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:51.450
and that CEOs recognized that
they need to have organizations

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.620
that address both the interests
of the people who invest

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.810
in them, who own
them, but also they

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.550
were held accountable
to their employees,

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.860
to their communities,
and societies.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.080
So we had this debate.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.870
We have to keep
that debate going.

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.410
In the poll that you
answered, a vast majority [?

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.570
of you ?] endorsed the
stakeholder view of the firm.

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.510
So let's get on with it.

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.400
But you also noted that
there's no magic bullet.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.280
There's no single practice
that high road firms can follow

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.150
to achieve these outcomes.

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.540
Instead, what we saw is that
there's a bundle of practices,

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.190
or what we call a
system of practices,

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.160
of employment practices,
operational features

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.640
of the organization,
business practices that

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.750
have to fit together
and be fitted

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.820
to the particular industries
and particular organizational

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.900
settings, particular
cultures and countries

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.790
in which they are embedded.

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.550
And this is just a list of the
basic things that we discussed.

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.830
That, yes, it starts by hiring
good, strong employees who

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.130
have good technical
skills and good people

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.680
in organizational skills so
they can work together in teams

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.540
and communicate with each other.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.880
Then we invest in
training and development

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.980
and make sure that we create
a culture of respect and trust

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.170
at the workplace.

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.000
Provide employees with
a good opportunity

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.720
to improve operations
in the organization,

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.210
to bring their voice
into the discussion

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.270
so that their
interests are reflected

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.000
in organizational
practices themselves.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.480
And then recognize
that you all want

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.330
good, flexible organizational
arrangements that

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.230
allow you to mix your personal
and your family and your work

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.020
lives, but to do it in creative
ways with modern technology,

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.750
with fair wages that are
linked, in some ways,

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.660
to productivity, to
performance, to the economy

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.240
of your organizations.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.950
And where there are
unions involved,

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.150
we need to have
strong partnerships

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.440
between labor and
management, not

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.660
the traditional
adversarial relations.

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.590
When we do those things,
we get this bundle.

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.620
We get this system of
reinforcing practices

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.630
between the business
strategies that

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.760
are followed to create high road
organizations, the employment

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.200
systems, the operational
practices, and the workforce

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:06.790
culture.

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.200
So we know something
about how to do this.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:15.440
And we know that this can
happen not only in traditional

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.660
profit-making firms or
public corporations,

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.769
but we discussed a whole range
of different organizational

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:22.580
forms--

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.260
family businesses
like Market Basket,

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.090
public corporations,
as we mentioned,

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.290
benefit corporations
like Patagonia,

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:35.520
employee-owned firms like my two
favorite breweries, New Belgium

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.660
and Harpoon, or in other
countries, IDEO in Sweden

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:40.660
and around the world.

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.480
There are examples of
employee-owned firms.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:48.080
Community ownership-- Mondragon
in Spain and other countries.

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.350
And then my favorite football
team, the Green Bay Packers,

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.630
owned by the community
and maintaining

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.160
long-standing good relationships
with their stakeholders

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.460
and their environments.

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.720
We also discussed
whether it's possible

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:06.520
for global corporations to
hold to high road standards

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:07.860
in their supply chains.

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.190
We've got a lot of work
to do in this area.

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:12.310
It's clear that we
have a long way to go.

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:15.490
But companies and their
suppliers and NGOs

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:16.720
are all working on it.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.070
So we recognize we can do
this in a variety of ways.

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:23.220
But I was particularly
excited and pleased

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:26.140
with the examples of high
road and low road firms

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:29.250
that you talked about in your
own assignments this week.

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.400
And you brought your
own personal experiences

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.290
as employees and sometimes as
customers into this process.

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:41.110
And here's just an example of
firms in the retail industry--

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.230
a family-owned firm, Wegmans.

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:45.520
That's a local one here
in the United States.

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.190
Whole Foods, which is known very
well, was used as an example

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:52.780
and compared with some other
organizations, one well known

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:55.760
and another one where we
just disguised the name a bit

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:00.290
in another country that
talked about the low wages

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:04.870
and lack of a living wage, not
particularly paying attention

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:07.550
to employee training
and development.

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:11.730
But also noting that even
in government agencies,

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:15.690
you had some very low road
firms or organizations

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:18.660
that favored their
certain employees

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:21.320
and didn't provide the kind
of feedback and opportunities

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:21.990
for growth.

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:25.080
But then there were some
libraries, hospitals,

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.990
government agencies that you
rated as high road firms.

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:32.520
The key point here is there's
no single organizational form,

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:35.250
and there's no single
model that says

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:38.840
you can only do this in some
sectors of the economy and not

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:39.380
others.

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:43.460
So I think we have brought
home this very key lesson

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:45.840
about the importance
of high road firms.

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.710
Our challenge now
is to make sure

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:51.050
that we figure out how to
spread them to larger numbers.

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:55.810
So this next week, it's time
to go on to the next subject.

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:58.460
We're going to take up
two critical issues--

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:01.870
entrepreneurship and
the role of technology.

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:04.300
And you've already started
those conversations

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:05.780
on the discussion forum.

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:09.780
So we'll continue them with some
really good videos and guest

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:13.500
interviews and material from
people all over the world,

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:18.780
talking about how we can use
technology to augment work,

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:21.880
not just to substitute
for work or displace work.

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:23.380
Yes, that's going to go on.

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:26.250
But pay particular
attention to what

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:31.650
our experts say we can do to use
technology to good advantage,

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:35.370
to augment and to support
good work in the future.

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:38.720
And then let's also discuss
how we can build high road

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:41.450
firms right from the beginning.

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:43.790
As entrepreneurs,
what do we need

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:46.730
to do to make sure that we
understand what it takes

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:49.150
to have a good
business model, to be

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:51.510
responsive to the
investors who are providing

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:55.220
the capital for these firms, but
also to make sure that we make

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:59.830
the choices about how we build
good jobs and careers for all

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:03.350
of the employees in
these new enterprises.

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:04.890
And let me make a final offer.

00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:08.360
And that is, we're
almost about, as I said,

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:10.440
at the midpoint of the course.

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:15.040
And I'd like to use this weekend
to offer an open forum, sort

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:17.530
of office hours on the
discussion board, where

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:22.610
my team here for the course and
I will be available to answer

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:24.940
questions, to engage
in commentary,

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:28.750
to continue the dialogue
with you more directly.

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:31.750
So please take a look
at the discussion board,

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:34.210
participate with us,
ask us questions.

00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:37.860
Let's use this as an opportunity
to see what we have learned

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:40.840
so far, to continue to
debate, even with us

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:41.940
if you disagree with us.

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:43.120
That's fine, too.

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:45.490
Let's have a good
discussion this weekend.

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:49.140
I'll make sure that I check the
discussion board periodically

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:52.720
over the next several days
and see what's on your mind.

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:54.970
And then, finally,
this weekend, we

00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:58.810
will give you a short
evaluation to do us a favor

00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:02.210
and give us a mid-course
evaluation on how

00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:03.540
we are doing in the course.

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:07.120
So I look forward to continuing
the conversations this weekend

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:09.325
and in the weeks ahead.
