00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.910
We're speaking today with Eric
Brynjolfsson, a professor here

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:11.950
at MIT Sloan School
of Management,

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.520
the director of the MIT
Initiative on the Digital

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.520
Economy, and co-author
of a bestselling book,

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.510
The Second Machine
Age, a book that really

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.270
has gotten the
conversation going

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.290
about how important
today's digital economy is,

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:29.480
how the technologies
that are coming along

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.350
are going to have an enormous
effect on the future of work.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.260
So Eric, thank you
for joining us.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.260
It's a real pleasure.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:35.770
Good.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:36.810
Let's get started.

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.880
Why don't you tell
us why you think

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.780
the current technological
wave of innovation

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.530
is as important as the
first Industrial Revolution,

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.035
with the steam engine and all
the things that went with it.

00:00:50.035 --> 00:00:51.410
Well, you know,
technologies make

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.576
a huge difference in the
living standards of people.

00:00:53.576 --> 00:00:56.010
For centuries, living standards
were essentially stagnant

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.870
until James Watt and others
developed a better steam

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.340
engine, and that ignited
the Industrial Revolution.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.330
And ever since then,
living standards

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:07.710
have been growing about 2% per
year, which adds up to a lot.

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.810
What those
technologies really did

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.650
was they augmented
and automated a lot

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.280
of muscle power from humans
and animals to machines.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.320
What we're seeing
now is that machines

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.400
are beginning to be able
to do the same thing

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.370
for our brains and our minds.

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.240
We have computers and
software and big data

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.300
that are learning how to
help us make decisions,

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.490
how to extend our
mental capacity.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.260
And that's at least as profound
a difference as what the steam

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.230
engine and, later, the
internal combustion

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.650
engine and other technologies
did for our muscles.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:46.040
Well, it's very clear that
technological changes like this

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.650
are very good for the economy,
but they also affect work.

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.150
Tell us a little bit about
how technologies affect

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.970
work in what ways-- in positive
ways, in negative ways--

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.521
and then we can
go on from there.

00:01:57.521 --> 00:01:58.020
Sure.

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.510
Well, the big headline
is the first one

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:01.500
you mentioned, that the
pie is getting bigger.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.830
And so we have to
keep sight of that,

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.040
that basically these are
technologies that create

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.090
more abundance, more wealth.

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.990
And there's more wealth now than
there ever has been in history,

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:12.690
and global poverty
is going down.

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.960
So that's the good news.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.400
But the reality is that
there's no economic law that

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.030
says that everyone's going
to benefit evenly from this.

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.210
It's possible for some
people to be made worse off.

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.219
In fact, there's
no economic reason

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:26.010
that you couldn't have
a majority of people

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.654
be made worse off, even as other
people get much, much better.

00:02:29.654 --> 00:02:31.070
Through most of
history, there was

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.380
a rising tide that lifted
most boats, almost all boats.

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.240
But in the past 20
years or so, there's

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.310
been what we call a
decoupling, where productivity

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.700
has continued to grow, GDP per
capita has continued to grow,

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.160
but the median income, the 50th
percentile and those below it,

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.320
have seen their incomes
stagnate or even fall.

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.060
And that reflects the fact
that these technologies

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.770
don't affect everybody evenly.

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.300
So let's play this out.

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.560
How do you see these
technologies affecting work

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.100
in the future?

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.834
Well, the technologies
continue to advance,

00:03:04.834 --> 00:03:07.000
and they continue to affect
different kinds of jobs.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.680
But what really matters is
how we go about using them.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.580
What we've seen so far is
that many of the technologies

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.910
have been used to
automate a lot of routine

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.410
information-processing work,
things like bank tellers,

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.160
bookkeepers, a lot
of middle managers.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.070
In fact, about 60% of
Americans primarily

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.850
do information-processing
work, so that's a big category.

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.992
And machines are very
good at automating

00:03:29.992 --> 00:03:31.450
a lot of these,
especially the more

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.090
repetitive, routine
information-processing tasks.

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.632
It turns out that the people
who do those jobs are typically

00:03:37.632 --> 00:03:39.340
in the middle of the
income distribution,

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.600
and what they've seen is
that as machines get better

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.010
at those tasks, there's
less demand for humans

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.290
to do the identical tasks.

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.579
Or if they do still
have jobs, they

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:49.620
have to compete with
machines that are doing them

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:50.840
more and more cheaply.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.160
And that his pushed down wages.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.980
It's led to fewer
job opportunities

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:56.750
in those categories.

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.810
At the same time, there's been
growth in job opportunities

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.170
at the other ends of
the spectrum, what

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.010
David Autor and other people
call job polarization.

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.210
At the high end, you
get creative people

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:11.294
or entrepreneurs are
making, in some cases,

00:04:11.294 --> 00:04:12.460
more money than ever before.

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:13.990
It's probably the
best time in history.

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:15.650
If you have some kind
of special talent

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.470
that could be
replicated digitally,

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.640
you might end up
being a billionaire.

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.670
On the other hand, the
other end of the spectrum

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:24.930
has also seen some
growth, and those

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.150
are jobs that require a lot
of dexterity or physical tasks

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.300
or interpersonal skills,
things that machines

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.320
aren't very good at.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.720
The thing is, often those
jobs don't pay very well.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.770
And just to be specific,
those are the kinds

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.860
of jobs like a
waiter or a gardener

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.080
or a janitor, those
kinds of tasks.

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.140
So what is your advice,
then, to workers

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.940
facing this world of
changing technology?

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.150
What should they
do in order to be

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.530
able to prosper in this world?

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.750
Well, what you'd
like to try to do

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.180
is strengthen those
areas where humans have

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.306
an advantage over machines.

00:05:00.306 --> 00:05:02.596
You don't really want to be
competing against machines.

00:05:02.596 --> 00:05:04.580
Ideally, you'd like to
do things were machines

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.120
can leverage your talents.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.944
Data scientists
are more in demand

00:05:07.944 --> 00:05:09.360
than ever before,
because machines

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.250
have created an
abundance of data,

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:12.580
but they can't analyze it.

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.380
They can't even ask the
right questions themselves.

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:16.870
You need humans to do that.

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:18.990
And so if you have
those kinds of skills,

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:20.390
you're more valuable than ever.

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:22.650
And Silicon Valley,
and now companies

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.550
throughout the
country and the world,

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.830
are greatly demanding
those kinds of workers.

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:29.960
And so there's a set of
categories around that.

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.501
I mentioned earlier, if you have
some kind of special talents

00:05:32.501 --> 00:05:35.180
or creativity, machines
aren't very creative.

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:39.790
People who can sing well or
who can invent new businesses,

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:44.470
as entrepreneurs, many kinds
of scientists, artists,

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:46.940
if you're a great
writer or write books,

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:48.990
those are things
that are probably

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:50.870
more valuable now than before.

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:53.670
Another big category that's
gotten to be more valuable is--

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:55.480
I touched on it earlier-- is
some of these interpersonal

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.120
skills--

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.310
nurturing and caring.

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.750
I don't think it would
have been very motivating

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:04.930
if, at the half time of the
football games last weekend,

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:06.760
the coach had been
a robot coach.

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.830
You need a human to do that.

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:11.770
And that means that
leadership, team work,

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:12.860
those kinds of things.

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:15.500
We still connect with
other people a lot better,

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.030
and we will for some time.

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:19.780
And I think all those skills,
from the creative ones

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:22.650
to the interpersonal, the
teamwork, the nurturing skills,

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:23.890
they can all be developed.

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:26.090
And I would encourage
people to work harder

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:27.990
at developing those
kinds of skills.

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:31.110
Become a better salesperson,
negotiator, nurturing,

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:34.180
caring for people, nursing.

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:36.310
Those are all things
that I expect to grow,

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:37.940
even as machines
take care of more

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:41.210
and more of the routine,
repetitive kinds of tasks.

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:45.030
So that's great advice
to the workforce.

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:46.910
Let's talk a bit about
the people who are

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:48.820
designing these technologies.

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:54.420
How can we encourage
more technological design

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:57.940
that complements work, that
utilizes these skills, that

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:00.220
thinks about ways
to enhance them

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:04.910
or to work with them
to drive productivity

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:06.246
and economic performance?

00:07:06.246 --> 00:07:07.870
Well, I'm glad you
asked that question,

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:09.286
because most people
don't even get

00:07:09.286 --> 00:07:10.706
as far as asking that question.

00:07:10.706 --> 00:07:12.330
I think there's a
widespread assumption

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:14.150
out there that
technology just happens,

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:16.600
and there's nothing you can
do to shape the path of it.

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:19.300
The reality is that you
can encourage people

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:23.580
to have technologies that create
more inclusive innovation, that

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:25.800
helps people more
broadly, or that

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.940
mostly focuses on substituting
for people, for that matter.

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:31.670
And we, as a society
and as individuals,

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:33.490
can shape the
direction of technology

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:36.160
to quite a significant extent.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.810
One of the things we can do is
change around our tax policy

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:42.130
and our government policies.

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:44.250
One of the oldest
rules of economics

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:47.350
is if you want less of
something, you tax it.

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:49.350
If you want more of
something, you subsidize it.

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:52.650
Right now, ironically,
we are taxing work.

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:57.400
If two entrepreneurs come up
with a billion-dollar idea,

00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:59.510
and one of them involves
employing lots of people

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:01.630
and one of them doesn't,
our current tax system

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:04.620
will put more taxes on the
one that employs more people,

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:06.510
and that's probably
not we want to do.

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:09.919
Conversely, we don't tax
pollution, carbon, congestion,

00:08:09.919 --> 00:08:11.460
things that we'd
like to see less of.

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:12.918
So we could rejigger
the tax system

00:08:12.918 --> 00:08:15.130
to tax the things that
we don't want more,

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:22.460
and then we'll have less of
them, and lower the taxes,

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:24.410
or even subsidize, work.

00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:26.510
And I think that would
guide entrepreneurs

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:28.120
to be more creative
about inventing

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:31.650
things that have less pollution
and more widespread labor.

00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:35.210
The Earned Income Tax Credit is
a good example, but too small.

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:36.816
Could be expanded at that.

00:08:36.816 --> 00:08:38.190
Another kind of
thing we could do

00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:42.030
is just recognize reward
and motivate people.

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:45.030
One of the things that I've
learned over the past few years

00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:47.330
is how much people
can be motivated

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:49.490
by having a prize and a
goal in front of them.

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:51.660
I've been watching
the DARPA Robotics

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:53.930
Challenge, the DARPA
Grand Challenge that

00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:55.640
led to the driverless car.

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:57.620
And I see my colleagues
in engineering,

00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:00.412
grad students, professors
working nights and weekends

00:09:00.412 --> 00:09:02.870
to solve this challenge that
has been put in front of them.

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:05.170
And many times,
they do come around

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:07.550
to making huge strides in that.

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:09.920
Why don't we try to
reward and motivate

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:13.090
business leaders and
economists to reinvent

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:15.150
the businesses and
economy the same way

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:17.820
that technologists have been
reinventing the technology?

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:20.140
And in fact, here at MIT,
we're launching something

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:23.140
called the Inclusive
Innovation Competition, which

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:25.690
is designed specifically
to recognize those business

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:29.060
models that use technology
to create broad,

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:30.190
shared prosperity.

00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:34.370
We call it shared prosperity
for the many, not just the few.

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:36.070
It's just getting
launched, but we

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:39.720
think this is going to be a good
way to recognize and highlight

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:40.830
people who have done that.

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:42.280
I think that's a
great idea, and I

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:45.130
hope that it creates
a lot of attention,

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:49.380
and that we get lots of
people really thinking along

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:55.630
these ways, because I think
it's the genius of people--

00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:59.560
using technologies to address
important problems that

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:01.940
will help make progress.

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:03.550
Yeah, and we all have choices.

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:05.560
We can shape the future
in that direction.

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:06.990
And why don't we
encourage people

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:09.370
who are doing it in a way
that does create this shared

00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:10.960
prosperity?

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:13.640
So let me ask this final
question, because it's

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:15.260
obviously on everybody's mind.

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.560
And that is, from time
to time in history,

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:21.160
as you know better than
I, people have worried

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:23.490
that technology is
going to replace work,

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:24.870
it's going to be
the end of work,

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:26.500
we're not going to
have enough jobs.

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:30.010
And that's an issue on
people's mind today.

00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:32.140
How do you think about
that problem, given

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:34.720
all of the innovation
that's going on

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.620
and that could
come down the road?

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:39.760
Well, down the road,
I could certainly

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:42.611
imagine technology creating
kind of a Star Trek economy.

00:10:42.611 --> 00:10:44.610
And I don't think that's
necessarily a bad thing

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:47.440
if technology's able to take
care of all of our basic needs

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:48.000
for us.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.090
But the more
immediate issue is not

00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:51.640
that technology is
going to eliminate

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:54.330
all the jobs, but the types
of jobs that are affected.

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:58.090
The reality is that technology's
always been destroying jobs.

00:10:58.090 --> 00:10:59.450
It's always been creating jobs.

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:01.770
But most importantly, it's
been changing the mix.

00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:04.450
And what we're seeing recently,
as I touched on earlier,

00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:07.504
is that mix is changing in
a way that a lot of people

00:11:07.504 --> 00:11:09.420
are being made worse
off, and other people are

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:11.000
being made much better off.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.180
And we want to try to shape the
direction of the technology.

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:16.980
We want to also give people
the skills and education

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:18.790
so they can adapt to
the new kinds of jobs

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:19.710
that are available.

00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:21.560
And if we do that,
I think we're going

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:24.474
to be able to have that kind
of world of shared prosperity.

00:11:24.474 --> 00:11:26.390
The technology will march
on, and we shouldn't

00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:27.770
try to stop the technology.

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:29.400
That's how we get
that bigger pie,

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:30.820
that growth that I mentioned.

00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:32.400
But we can direct it.

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.590
In the earlier
industrial revolutions,

00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:37.710
when the steam engine and
other technologies came along,

00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:39.640
we adapted our institutions.

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:41.760
We invented mass
public education,

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:43.690
first at the primary
level, and then later

00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:44.940
at the secondary level.

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:48.220
We invented social security and
a whole bunch of other policies

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:51.240
that helped smooth
that transition

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:53.200
to a new kind of work
force and cushioned

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:55.580
the people who otherwise
would have been left behind.

00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:57.580
We're going to have to
reinvent education again.

00:11:57.580 --> 00:11:58.996
And this time,
we're going to have

00:11:58.996 --> 00:12:01.490
to do our best to shape
the technology that

00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:03.590
is aligned with our values.

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:06.120
Ultimately, it's not what
the technology does to us.

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:07.840
Technology is a tool.

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:10.940
It's always been a tool, whether
it's a hammer or an enterprise

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:12.380
resource planning system.

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:15.770
We have more powerful tools
now than we ever had before,

00:12:15.770 --> 00:12:18.470
and that means we have more
power to shape the future

00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:19.690
than we ever did before.

00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:22.300
But it starts with understanding
that we have that power,

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:25.181
and aligning our
actions with our values.

00:12:25.181 --> 00:12:27.430
Well, Eric, I think that's
a really important message,

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:31.530
and one that I'm delighted that
we can deliver in this class

00:12:31.530 --> 00:12:33.760
and in other settings
where people can really

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:34.510
make a difference.

00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:35.886
So thanks for joining us today.

00:12:35.886 --> 00:12:37.010
It's a tremendous pleasure.

00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:39.010
Thanks a lot, Tom.
