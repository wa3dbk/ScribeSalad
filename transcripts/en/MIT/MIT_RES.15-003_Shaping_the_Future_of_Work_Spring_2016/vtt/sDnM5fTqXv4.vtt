00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.020
One of the central
tasks of this course

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.400
has been to unpack the ways in
which work in today's economy

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.310
has changed over time.

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.980
Often, when we talk
about this topic,

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.120
one of the first things
that comes to mind

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.410
is the role of technology
in transforming work.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.270
Over the past few years, we
have seen an explosion in what's

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.300
known as the on-demand economy.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.180
It's visible everywhere.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.530
We as consumers are able
to have our food delivered,

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.200
grab a ride home, or even have
someone run their errands,

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.970
all purchased and arranged
in a matter of minutes

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.490
from our smartphones.

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:53.090
Our colleague John
McCarthy talks

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:54.690
in more detail
about these new ways

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.990
of organizing work
in a different video

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:58.590
lecture in this course.

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.770
What we're going
to talk about now

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.700
is how these
employment arrangements

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.790
are connected to two issues--

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.120
one, how we think
about workers' rights

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.440
in the on-demand economy, and
two, how technology can promote

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.230
new forms of worker advocacy
in settings where gigs,

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.600
not full-time jobs
for one employer,

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.200
are becoming the
employment norm.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.690
Many consumers and
workers alike find

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.970
the flexibility and efficiency
of the on-demand economy

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.420
to be beneficial.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.270
Work hours are
flexible, for instance,

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.000
and the efficiency of
services saves people time.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.740
As has been pointed out,
however, many workers

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.500
undertaking the actual
jobs of these companies

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.130
are employed as
independent contractors,

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.690
meaning that they are not direct
employees of the company that

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.190
is bringing us the
good or the service.

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.220
A babysitter who gets his work
through the website Care.com,

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.190
for instance, is considered
to be self-employed.

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.640
This means that the benefits and
protections that we associate

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.450
with full time, stable jobs,
such as access to paid leave

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.680
or unemployment
insurance, are not

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.060
available to on-demand workers.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.310
Likewise, standards that
promote good, quality jobs

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.060
are often absent from
these arrangements,

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.900
as we've seen through
the recent protests

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.530
by Uber drivers over
wages and terms of work

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.900
in various cities.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.990
So the traditional system
of benefits and protections

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.810
based on full time jobs
and employment status

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.300
no longer makes sense
in these settings.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.620
Innovative, disruptive
technologies

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.820
that change the way business
is done and work is performed

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.020
require simultaneous
innovative changes

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.150
in how workers are able to
access rights on the job.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.320
What we've talked
about in this course

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.580
is updating the social
contract at work.

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.090
One approach to such
change comes with support

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.340
from a broad coalition of
technology firms, labor

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.560
organizations, academics,
and foundations.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.680
The idea is pretty simple--

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.490
that benefits and
protections should

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.910
accrue with the work
being performed,

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.770
no matter the employer.

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.080
In other words, the number
of sick days, for instance,

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.490
a gig worker can accrue should
depend on the number of hours

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:17.320
she works, whether providing
rides or delivering groceries.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.580
Although firms would
contribute to these benefits

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.810
and protections, they
would essentially

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.440
remain with the worker,
allowing for economic security

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.120
even when working for
multiple employers.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.220
They can be structured in a way
that promotes good jobs that

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:32.800
pay living wages.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.160
And by making these
portable benefits universal,

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.600
they can also extend to workers
beyond the on-demand economy,

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.840
helping ease the now-commonplace
transitions that many of us

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.740
experience moving from
one employer to the next.

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.080
The idea of portable
benefits mimics

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.180
these new on-demand
arrangements that

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.190
characterize growing
portions of the economy.

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.970
Likewise, advocates are
also finding new ways

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.440
to use technology to promote
workers' rights on the job.

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.250
In some cases, this is directly
relevant to on-demand workers

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.460
themselves.

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:11.580
Relatively new websites, such
as coworker.org and Dynamo,

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.670
serve as online
hubs where workers

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.980
can start petitions for
change, rate their experience

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.130
with certain
employers, and connect

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:20.810
with others in their industry.

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.170
Turkopticon is a
similar application

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:26.400
that allows crowd workers
on Amazon's Mechanical Turk

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.420
to rate employers.

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:30.980
These applications
compliment organizing efforts

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.520
in other settings as well.

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.440
In our last video, we
talked about Our Walmart,

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.880
an organization of
non-unionized Walmart workers

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.620
advocating for better
working conditions.

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.140
Using an online campaign
through coworker.org,

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:48.880
Our Walmart was recently able
to gather widespread support

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.860
for their demands regarding
more stable hours.

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.530
In response, Walmart changed
the way they schedule shifts.

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:58.690
With support from an
innovative organization

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:01.600
called the Workers Lab, which
promotes new forms of worker

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.930
organizing, Our Walmart
is also developing

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.490
an app that allows workers to
connect with one another while

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.060
receiving peer-generated
advice and training

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.260
relevant to their jobs.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.480
Other organizations are
developing applications

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.520
that not only serve to
connect workers and mobilize

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.100
around specific demands, but
also to inform and educate

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.290
workers about their
rights on the job.

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:27.590
The Domestic Worker
app, for example,

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.880
was created in response to the
passage of a domestic worker

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.100
bill of rights in
New York state.

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:37.300
Caregivers, nannies, and
cleaners can call in or text

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.680
to access both recorded and
live informational episodes

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.410
and messages about their
rights under the state's

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:45.730
new legislation.

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:48.240
A different approach is taken
by the Restaurant Opportunity

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.850
Center, the organization
of restaurant workers

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.750
we discussed in our last video.

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:55.700
The center's Top
Server app is a game

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:58.050
that teaches its users
about the skills needed

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:01.730
to advance in restaurants,
imparting training, knowledge,

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:04.050
and even the lingo
used in restaurant work

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:07.080
to servers looking for ways
to advance in the industry.

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.500
To be clear, these
new forms of advocacy

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.310
are not a replacement for
direct work or organizing

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:14.060
and other advocacy work.

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.880
But as these organizations
show, the types

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.600
of technologies that are
transforming the way we work

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.920
can also be used to
strengthen our efforts

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.020
to create good jobs.

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.410
And as the on-demand
economy continues

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:28.730
to be fueled by growing
consumer demand,

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:31.890
we will continue to be
presented with opportunities

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:34.320
for a potential innovation
and re-establishing

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:37.900
the social contract at work,
not just for on-demand workers,

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.460
but for all workers
throughout the economy.
