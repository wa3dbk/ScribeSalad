00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.270
Welcome to our week six.

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:11.190
It's time to negotiate the next
generation social contract.

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.540
So I'm looking forward to a
really exciting and fruitful

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:15.320
week.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.060
All the instructions are now
on the platform on week six,

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.270
so all you need to
do is to go to it.

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:26.550
You'll see instructions
for how to find your team,

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.430
your role assignments.

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.650
Then you go through, and
you'll complete the preparation

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.700
survey, you'll negotiate
online with your counterparts,

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.970
hopefully in the same time
zone where you are located.

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.710
And then as you complete
the survey form at the end,

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.990
to record your
settlements, those of you

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:50.090
who are taking the course for
certification and for a grade

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.640
will get some extra credit
as described on the platform.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.030
So we're excited about it.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.020
We're looking forward to
hearing what you have in mind

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.970
for shaping the future of work.

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.819
As a bonus, we will
provide a facilitator.

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:09.560
One of our MBA students, what
we call our community TAs,

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.560
will be assigned to your group.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.100
What is a facilitator?

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.890
A facilitator is just what
that term sounds like.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.400
It's a neutral
person, it's a person

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.880
who helps move you
through the process

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.520
without influencing
your proposals

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.370
or the particular terms of
the agreement that you reach.

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.930
So this individual will
help you in scheduling times

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.080
or answering questions
and be a liaison back

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.800
to the rest of us as needed.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.940
So use the facilitator
at your choice,

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.470
and we'll see how
all of this works.

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:49.640
The deadline is Thursday at the
end of the day UTC time 11:59

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:50.390
PM.

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.910
So it's important that
you and your teammates

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.840
work on an agreement
on when to negotiate,

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.570
engage in the course
discussion as instructed.

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.500
And we'll see what we
learn from this experience.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.449
Next week is the grand
finale of this course,

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:11.009
and we have a special event.

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.100
It's called a live video
event or video chat,

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.690
whatever one wants to call it.

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.560
On Tuesday, May 10th
at UTC time 8:00 PM,

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.560
we will have an hour and
a half live interaction

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.290
with all of you, where
we will summarize

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.020
what we have taken away as the
key lessons from this course.

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.950
And we'll incorporate
the materials

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.300
not only from the
course but also

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.740
your materials from the
polls that you completed,

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.960
the surveys, the assignments
that you did, the discussions

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.940
that you've had on the forum,
all of this will come together.

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.330
And with your
engagement, directly

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.510
by passing on questions
to us or comments

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.660
as we go along, for
an hour and a half

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.140
we will see what did we learn
from this, where are we going,

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.430
and how can we use
all of this material

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.770
effectively, not
only for yourselves,

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.460
but for external audiences who
are also interested in shaping

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:08.750
the future of work.

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.310
So please put this
on your calendar,

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.600
be ready with
questions or comments.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.900
We'll send you
information next Monday,

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.970
the day before
this event, on how

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.930
to tune in, where to link
in for this interesting,

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.320
I hope interesting,
and informative wrap-up

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.730
for the course.

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.770
Let me make a special
request of you

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:33.250
to make sure that we bring
your voices into this process,

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.900
one segment of the summary
will ask the question

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.920
"What is our key message
to the future leaders who

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.810
will shape the future of work?"

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.430
Business leaders and
HR professionals,

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.540
labor leaders and
their advocates,

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.260
government policymakers,
and those of us

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:51.720
in the education field.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.650
So make sure that, on the
discussion board this week,

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.990
where we will post
questions or a place

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:02.190
where you can add your thoughts
to each of these stakeholders,

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.540
that you bring your
voice into this process.

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.400
And we'll incorporate that
into the discussion next week,

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.900
Tuesday.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.400
So I look forward to seeing
what you have on your mind

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.440
and what message
you want to deliver

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.440
to these groups who will help
to shape the future of work.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.510
Last week we had a very, very
rich, and engaging discussion,

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.210
and, in fact, throughout
this course, many of you

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.740
commented on the
subject for last week

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.160
and that is: "What's
the future of Labor?"

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.180
Is there still a need
for labor organizations,

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.710
for unions as we've called
them over many years,

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.530
and in fact over
several centuries?

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.580
Is there a new form
of representation?

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.070
Are there new ways in which
workers can get a voice at work

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:49.910
and assert their interests
and work with their employers

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:52.420
to shape the future of work?

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.660
Most of you do see
the need for some form

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:59.580
of labor representation,
maybe not for everyone,

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.210
but for the people
who really want

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.860
to have a collective
voice at the workplace.

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.170
But you also see the need for
change, and for innovation,

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:09.880
to build on the
strengths of what

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.210
unions have done
historically for so

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:13.910
many workers around the world.

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:16.160
You talked about
the need to expand

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.840
more labor-management
partnerships,

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.910
like the one out at Kaiser
Permanente that we discussed.

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:24.530
Many of you focused, in
a very rich dialogue,

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:27.250
over the need for what
you call digital unions.

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:31.700
That is using information
technology, social media,

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:35.640
and related mechanisms
to convey your ideas

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.620
and to communicate with
each other across the world.

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.980
And indeed you talked about
the need for global unions,

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:45.970
because obviously today,
where people work, how people

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:49.040
are affected by jobs
that are created

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:53.890
by companies around the world,
is not simply a national issue.

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:55.310
Some of you talked
about the need

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:58.990
to return to these interesting
organizations called guilds,

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:02.050
where workers came
together cooperatively

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:06.010
to enhance their profession
or their particular occupation

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:09.410
and to work to enhance
their professionalism.

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:12.230
You talked about
the need for apps

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:15.030
to share information
on where good jobs are

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:17.240
and good employers
are, along the lines

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:21.230
that we used in the good
jobs survey that some of you

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:21.820
have done.

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:24.060
And then many of you
talked about the need

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:28.620
for new forms of advocates
for low-wage workers

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:31.590
in the United States, in
Europe, in developing countries

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:33.700
all around the
world, particularly

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:37.260
focusing on the role that
NGOs are now playing.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.950
So I think the bottom
line of all of this:

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:42.460
don't just observe these trends.

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:44.600
Get involved,
whether it's working

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:48.230
on the side of
advocates for labor,

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:51.170
whether it's enriching
and strengthening

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:54.390
the role that HR plays
in our organizations,

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:57.630
whether it's thinking
about the future of labor

00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:00.220
policy in our countries,
or whether you're

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:02.710
like me working in
the education sphere,

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:06.310
either on the university
level with the outside world,

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:11.440
all of you in this
global-based online course,

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.870
or are school students in high
schools and community colleges.

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:16.590
We all have a role to play.

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:19.570
We've emphasized that
throughout this course, now

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:21.800
it's time for us to
put our ideas to work.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.510
So I look forward to a
very invigorating week

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:26.270
of negotiations.

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:29.330
We'll summarize the
settlements that

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:32.990
are achieved next week
when we come together,

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:36.260
and we'll see if we can't
really summarize and bring

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.120
together what did
we learn, what are

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.430
the key takeaways
from our efforts

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:43.130
to shape the future of work.
