00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.380
Since you're enrolled
in this course,

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.760
let's assume that you have
decided on, or perhaps are

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:17.500
already engaged in, a managerial
or professional career.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.860
And that you are
developing, or have already

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.070
developed the knowledge and
skills necessary to do the job.

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.200
That's great, but
don't stop there.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.630
Experts agree that it will take
a special set of competencies

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.990
to succeed in tomorrow's
organizations, which

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:42.140
will be even more globalized,
digitized, collaborative,

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.710
and agile than
those we see today.

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.550
Many have written on this topic.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.700
One of the best
sources, we think,

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.480
is a small monograph published
by the Institute of the Future,

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.800
titled, The Future
of Work Skills 2020.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.950
Here is a brief synopsis
of the 10 competencies

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.340
that the Institute suggests will
be essential for your career

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.020
success and the years ahead.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.440
First, relating
to globalization.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.420
The Institute stresses the need
for cross-cultural competency,

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.180
which has a couple
of key components.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.030
One is the ability
to work effectively

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.710
with those from other
cultures, perhaps

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.340
in teams made up of many
different nationalities.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.310
And the other is the ability
to work effectively outside

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.850
of your native land.

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.800
And while most
business probably will

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.280
continue to be
conducted in English,

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.150
it certainly wouldn't
hurt to have a familiarity

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.890
with other languages as well.

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.410
Turning to the circle
label digitisation,

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.940
we see that there are four
key competencies involved.

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.230
One is sense-making.

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.470
The future will be
all about mass data.

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.460
We will be even more
inundated than we are now,

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.840
so it will be necessary
to have the capacity

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.270
to work through
tons of information

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.210
and see the big picture.

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.940
We'll have to be
critical thinkers.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.260
But we also have to keep
in mind that technology

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.890
isn't good for everything.

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.650
So we need to
develop the capacity

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.850
to decide when to
rely on computers

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:35.310
for assistance and answers, and
just as important, when not to.

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.800
A second competency in this
area is computational thinking.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.130
This includes developing
a basic understanding

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.470
of computer programming
and simulation modeling.

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.810
It doesn't mean that we all
have to become computer geeks.

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:56.250
In the era of big data, We can
rely on specially trained data

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.580
scientists to do
the heavy lifting.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.750
But the rest of us
will need to know

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.820
enough about what
the experts are

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.840
doing to be actively involved
in the process in two ways.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.630
One is on the front end, to
frame questions and problems

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.460
in ways that the data
scientists can analyze a model.

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.860
And two, on the back
end, to be the ones who

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.940
interpret the results
and come up with value

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.570
added answers and solutions.

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.770
Third, in this context,
there is the issue

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:31.720
of new media literacy.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.740
Here the reference
is to becoming expert

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.320
in the use of
social media tools:

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.260
internets, blogs, podcasts,
videos, and so forth.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.280
In the future, many folks
will be working remotely

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.780
and will be called upon to
create and share content

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.140
through these
technologies, and to do so

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.950
in ways that not only help
solve complex problems,

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.550
but also engage and
persuade our colleagues

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:04.650
and other important people,
such as customers and clients.

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.180
Finally in this area is
cognitive load management.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.610
In tomorrow's world,
it will be very

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.040
easy to get overwhelmed by
the mass of information that's

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.560
bound to come our way.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.370
We need to learn
how to avoid this.

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.180
How to evaluate,
rank, and tag content

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.460
so that we keep our eyes
on what's really important

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.740
and let the rest go.

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.010
Somewhat ironically,
computer programs

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.430
are already available
to help with this.

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.480
They have the
ability to sense when

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.970
we are becoming
overloaded or tired,

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.580
and then, to
automatically intervene,

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.300
to slow down or simplify
the flow of information

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.030
we're getting.

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.870
Third, let's turn to the
issue of collaboration.

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:57.360
One essential competency
here is social intelligence.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.620
This refers to the
ability to connect

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.530
with others in an emotional
and deeply personal way

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.400
to quickly assess the
feelings of others

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.890
and then adapt our words,
tone, and gestures accordingly.

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:15.840
Everyone agrees that this is a
uniquely human competency that

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:20.230
so far, at least, gives
us a leg up on robots.

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:24.650
Further, the Institute talks
about virtual collaboration,

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:27.780
meaning the ability
to work effectively

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.290
with, and eventually, perhaps,
lead teammates we may never

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:35.270
meet or even see in person.

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:38.440
This involves becoming
really good at turning

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.740
in-house networks and
new media into what

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.410
some call social water coolers.

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:49.040
Important tools helping to
enhance a sense of camaraderie

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.220
and social presence
among colleagues

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.440
who are all over the map.

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.640
Online gamers already have
a leg up on developing

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.430
this competency, since
this is, in large part,

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:05.490
what they are learning to do.

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:08.040
And finally, let's
consider agility,

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:12.050
which really is the capacity
to be comfortable with change.

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:14.770
Three competencies
are stressed here.

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:17.740
One is novel and
adaptive thinking.

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:21.410
In a world of rapid
change, it is essential

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:23.540
that we never let
the tried and true

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:27.610
get in the way of being open
to new ways of doing things.

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:30.940
In the future, all of
us will be expected

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:35.090
to keep our eyes on developments
that are going on in the world

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:38.960
so that we can anticipate
upcoming challenges.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.430
And most important,
be on the leading edge

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:46.310
of developing unique and
creative ideas and solutions

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:51.290
to deal with these
challenges in real time.

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:56.270
Second, the Institute
talks about design mindset.

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:59.890
This is closely related to
novel and adaptive thinking.

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:04.050
It refers to being super
familiar with our work

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:07.930
situation, so that we can see
when changes need to be made.

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:10.240
But even more
important, it refers

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:13.810
to having the ability to
make useful recommendations

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:16.490
for redesigning the
work environment

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:19.760
as well as the processes
and procedures being

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:22.800
used to get the work done.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.080
And then, there is
what the Institute

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:28.210
calls transdisciplinarity,
which is

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:30.460
a big word for a simple idea.

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:34.690
In the future, the idea
worker will be t-shaped.

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:39.970
That is, deeply expert in one
or more disciplines, which

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:44.360
is the vertical part of the T,
but also knowledgeable about

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:47.510
and comfortable with
many other disciplines,

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:50.810
the horizontal part of
the T. In other words,

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:53.620
once your world
class one thing, make

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:58.020
sure you keep right on learning
about a lot of other things.

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:01.260
Success in the future will
depend on our willingness

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:05.290
and ability to keep
growing and developing

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:08.620
to become more global
in our thinking,

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:12.520
more comfortable with the
digitisation of everything,

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:16.540
ever better it collaborating
with colleagues and others,

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:22.060
and above all, staying deeply
committed to being adaptive,

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:24.504
lifelong learners.
