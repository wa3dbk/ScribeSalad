00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:06.660
ERIK DEMAINE: Algorithms
is an interesting area,

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.340
because it's very creative to
come up with new algorithms.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.370
There's often many ways
to solve the same problem.

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.020
But unlike art
say, in algorithms

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.047
there's a quantifiable
measures for how good you did.

00:00:21.047 --> 00:00:23.380
What is the running time of
the thing you ended up with?

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.110
How much space does it use?

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.020
It is efficient?

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.660
So it's nice in that
it's easy to evaluate

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.910
whether you kind of succeeded.

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:33.510
Did you get the n
log n algorithm?

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.090
Did you get the fastest
that's possible?

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.490
But it's hard to measure
a student's understanding

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:44.460
because it's like, did
you get the creative trick

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.200
that we had in mind,
or find another one

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.130
that's just as good?

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:50.590
Students may find a
different creative trick

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.590
that doesn't end up with as
good an algorithm in the end.

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:58.650
So we penalize that someone,
but for the most part

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.230
we are happy when people
get correct algorithms.

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.290
When they understand
the techniques

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.270
well enough that they get an
algorithm, it's pretty good.

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.290
May not be the best,
but we consider

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.290
that much better than they
were using the right technique,

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.870
but they ended up using it
wrong and so they end up

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.780
with something
doesn't even work.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:24.570
And that's much more
discouraging, I guess.

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.750
But in any case,
in a timed exam,

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.040
it's really hard to expect
students to be creative.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.720
So in that setting, it's hard.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.470
We don't expect a
lot of creativity.

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.510
We try to keep the
questions relatively simple,

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.239
so you need just
one simple idea.

00:01:40.239 --> 00:01:41.780
If you're familiar
with the material,

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:42.738
it should come quickly.

00:01:42.738 --> 00:01:45.100
It Doesn't always, but--

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.910
So problem sets are definitely
an easier way for students

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:49.270
to express creativity.

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.880
It gives them a little more
time to think about the problem.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.650
Because some problems are going
to come easy to some students

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:56.460
and hard to others.

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.084
It's going to be
different problem set,

00:01:58.084 --> 00:02:01.690
so they have a week
to think about it.

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.170
And also to talk to others,
we allow collaboration

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.510
in the problem sets,
so that makes it easier

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.940
to find solutions but
still learn a lot from it.

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.900
In the exams, it's a lot harder.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.480
In past years we've tried
take home exams as a way

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.285
to more accurately gauge
how creative someone is

00:02:19.285 --> 00:02:22.790
in applying these techniques
to design new algorithms.

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.360
We didn't do that this year.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.485
It's not clear what
the right answer is.

00:02:27.485 --> 00:02:29.940
It's definitely a challenge
in teaching algorithms,

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.460
is how to evaluate whether
someone can really apply

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.600
the techniques in new
and creative ways.
