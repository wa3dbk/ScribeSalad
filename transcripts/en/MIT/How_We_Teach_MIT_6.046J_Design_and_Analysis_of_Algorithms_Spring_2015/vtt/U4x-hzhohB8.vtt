ERIK DEMAINE: Hi,
I'm Erik Demaine,

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.140
and I'm a professor of
computer science here at MIT.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.360
And I'm one of three professors
in charge of this class

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.730
this semester-- 6.046
So I taught about half

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:18.640
of the lectures in the class.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.120
Srini taught the other half.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.040
And Nancy prepared
new problem sets.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.550
And we all worked
together on everything

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:27.720
in the class pretty much.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.630
We had, I think, 10 TAs
and then another 5 graders.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.730
So it's a big teaching
infrastructure

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:42.070
to deliver algorithms
to 300 students.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.940
My entire career at
MIT, all I have done

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.510
is taught different
forms of algorithms.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.750
So 6.046 holds a place
particularly dear to my heart.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.680
It's a class that's
evolved over time,

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:59.470
so there's an older
version of 6.046 on OCW

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.790
when algorithms in the
undergraduate level

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.980
was all taught in one semester,
which was exciting, but also

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.820
pretty intense and didn't
really go into a lot of depth.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.530
So several years ago,
we split that class

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.860
into two-- 6.006, which is
introductory algorithms.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.650
And the new 6.046, which
is this class, which

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.540
is intermediate algorithms
beyond what you could implement

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.890
in an hour-- things that
you have to think more about

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.590
and prove theorems about.

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.290
So 6.046 is sort of the
more theoretical counterpart

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.520
and gets into much more deeper
algorithms, and it's exciting.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.100
And all of my research is
also around algorithms.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:44.430
So this is me living the dream,
teaching the topic that I love.

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.830
And it's an exciting class.

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.960
This as an undergraduate
class, so the material

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.320
is stuff that I should
know really well.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.020
But every time I
teach it, I find

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.239
that I learn it at
an even deeper level

00:01:56.239 --> 00:01:57.280
and understand it better.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.250
Also, because I try
to add in new topics

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.550
that I don't know so well,
so I learn them even better.

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.490
And that, in turn,
influences my research.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.140
So once I understand
the basics really well,

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.300
I can apply them in new
and interesting ways

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.820
to solve problems I didn't
know how to solve before.

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.280
Algorithms are just so much fun.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.650
Sometimes I start the class
with I'm Erik Demaine,

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.710
and I love the algorithms!

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:24.750
It's just such a-- it's
really fun material.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.450
It's very creative.

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.570
It's almost like an
art form to come up

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.360
with a beautiful algorithm.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.556
And this class teaches so
many different algorithms

00:02:33.556 --> 00:02:34.680
that others have developed.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.346
It's kind of like the
cream of the crop.

00:02:36.346 --> 00:02:39.270
There's zillions out there,
so we can't cover all of them.

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.330
So we take out
representative examples

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.450
and find really cool,
really interesting,

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:44.810
or really beautiful algorithms.

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.700
And it's really fun
to cover them all

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.720
and to share that beauty
with the students.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.460
I think I've taught this class
10 times in some version.

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.070
So it's been an adventure.

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:01.190
Every time is different.

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.130
And, of course, the last
time is always the best.

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.228
Next time will be even
better, hopefully.
