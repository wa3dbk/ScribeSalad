00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.650
This week we'll see how
we can use analytics

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.860
to understand opinions
and intelligence.

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:11.800
In the first lecture,
we'll see how

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.660
we can use Tweets on Twitter to
understand sentiment and public

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.040
perception.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.240
In the second
lecture, we'll discuss

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.030
how IBM built a computer
that could beat the best

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:25.470
human players at Jeopardy,
a popular game show.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.760
Through these examples, we'll
introduce the exciting area

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.990
of text analytics, and
see how we can turn words

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.800
into variables to be
used in our models.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.780
Let's get started.
