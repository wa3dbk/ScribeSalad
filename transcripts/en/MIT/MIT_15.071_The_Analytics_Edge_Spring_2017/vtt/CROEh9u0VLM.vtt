00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:07.040
In CART, the value
of minbucket can

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.370
affect the model's
out-of-sample accuracy.

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.070
As we discussed
earlier in the lecture,

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.200
if minbucket is too small,
over-fitting might occur.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.480
But if minbucket is too large,
the model might be too simple.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.830
So how should we set
this parameter value?

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.390
We could select the value that
gives the best testing set

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.380
accuracy, but this isn't right.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.050
The idea of the testing set is
to measure model performance

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.210
on data the model has
never seen before.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.160
By picking the
value of minbucket

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.790
to get the best test
set performance,

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.820
the testing set was implicitly
used to generate the model.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.140
Instead, we'll use a method
called K-fold Cross Validation,

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.180
which is one way to properly
select the parameter value.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.020
This method works by going
through the following steps.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.960
First, we split the
training set into k

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.190
equally sized subsets, or folds.

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.500
In this example, k equals 5.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.370
Then we select k - 1, or four
folds, to estimate the model,

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.760
and compute predictions on
the remaining one fold, which

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.080
is often referred to
as the validation set.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.300
We build a model
and make predictions

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.770
for each possible parameter
value we're considering.

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.200
Then we repeat this for
each of the other folds,

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.479
or pieces of our training set.

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:37.720
So we would build a model
using folds 1, 2, 3,

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.780
and 5 to make
predictions on fold 4,

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.229
and then we would build a
model using folds 1, 2, 4,

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.320
and 5 to make predictions
on fold 3, etc.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.830
So ultimately, cross
validation builds

00:01:53.830 --> 00:02:00.360
many models, one for each fold
and possible parameter value.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.170
Then, for each candidate
parameter value,

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.490
and for each fold,
we can compute

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.780
the accuracy of the model.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.410
This plot shows the possible
parameter values on the x-axis,

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.120
and the accuracy of the
model on the y-axis.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.390
This line shows the accuracy
of our model on fold 1.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.790
We can also compute the
accuracy of the model using

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.300
each of the other folds
as the validation sets.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.410
We then average the
accuracy over the k

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.370
folds to determine
the final parameter

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.900
value that we want to use.

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.850
Typically, the behavior
looks like this--

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.400
if the parameter
value is too small,

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.590
then the accuracy is lower,
because the model is probably

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.940
over-fit to the training set.

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.110
But if the parameter
value is too large,

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.980
then the accuracy is also
lower, because the model

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.079
is too simple.

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:59.340
In this case, we would pick
a parameter value around six,

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.770
because it leads to the
maximum average accuracy

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:04.330
over all parameter values.

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.010
So far, we've used the
parameter minbucket

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.580
to limit our tree in R. When
we use cross validation in R,

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.329
we'll use a parameter
called cp instead.

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:21.010
This is the
complexity parameter.

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.270
It's like Adjusted R-squared
for linear regression,

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.110
and AIC for logistic
regression, in that it measures

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.850
the trade-off between model
complexity and accuracy

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:33.790
on the training set.

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.170
A smaller cp value
leads to a bigger tree,

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.310
so a smaller cp value
might over-fit the model

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:41.910
to the training set.

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.720
But a cp value that's
too large might

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.200
build a model that's too simple.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.880
Let's go to R, and
use cross validation

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.850
to select the value of
cp for our CART tree.

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.050
In our R console, let's
try cross validation

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:58.810
for our CART model.

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.590
To do this, we need to install
and load two new packages.

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.450
First, we'll install
the package "caret".

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.250
You should see some lines
run in your R console,

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.930
and then when you're back
to the blinking cursor,

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.329
load the package
with library(caret).

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:30.020
Now, let's install
the package "e1071".

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:39.280
So again,
install.packages("e1071").

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.730
Again, you should see some
lines run in your R console,

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:44.680
and when you're
back to the cursor,

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:51.340
load the package
with library(e1071).

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.590
Now, we'll define our cross
validation experiment.

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.220
First, we need to define
how many folds we want.

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.560
We can do this using the
trainControl function.

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:13.060
So we'll say numFolds
= trainControl,

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:18.420
and then in parentheses,
method = "cv",

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:25.690
for cross validation, and then
number = 10, for 10 folds.

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.920
Then we need to pick the
possible values for our cp

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:33.340
parameter, using the
expand.grid function.

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:42.770
So we'll call it cpGrid,
and then use expand.grid,

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:57.240
where the only argument is
.cp = seq(0.01,0.5,0.01).

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.400
This will define
our cp parameters

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:07.800
to test as numbers from 0.01
to 0.5, in increments of 0.01.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.340
Now, we're ready to
perform cross validation.

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:14.600
We'll do this using the
train function, where

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.170
the first argument
is similar to that

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:18.720
when we're building models.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:22.100
It's the dependent
variable, Reverse,

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:26.490
followed by a tilde symbol, and
then the independent variables

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:36.990
separated by plus signs--
Circuit + Issue + Petitioner +

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:50.820
Respondent +
LowerCourt + Unconst.

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:55.750
Our data set here is
Train, with a capital T,

00:06:55.750 --> 00:07:02.510
and then we need to add the
arguments method = "rpart",

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:05.840
since we want to cross
validate a CART model,

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:12.430
and then trControl =
numFolds, the output

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:20.750
of our trainControl function,
and then tuneGrid = cpGrid,

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:24.990
the output of the
expand.grid function.

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:28.210
If you hit Enter, it
might take a little while,

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:30.040
but after a few
seconds, you should

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:32.630
get a table describing
the cross validation

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:37.060
accuracy for different
cp parameters.

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:41.440
The first column gives the
cp parameter that was tested,

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:43.950
and the second column
gives the cross validation

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:46.920
accuracy for that cp value.

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:51.390
The accuracy starts
lower, and then increases,

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:56.420
and then will start decreasing
again, as we saw in the slides.

00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:59.920
At the bottom of
the output, it says,

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:04.370
"Accuracy was used to select the
optimal model using the largest

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:05.510
value.

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:11.170
The final value used for
the model was cp = 0.18."

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:15.820
This is the cp value we want
to use in our CART model.

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:19.640
So now let's create a new CART
model with this value of cp,

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:22.700
instead of the
minbucket parameter.

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:28.650
We'll call this
model StevensTreeCV,

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:32.750
and we'll use the rpart
function, like we did earlier,

00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:39.220
to predict Reverse using all
of our independent variables:

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:50.760
Circuit, Issue,
Petitioner, Respondent,

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:56.520
LowerCourt, and Unconst.

00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:05.160
Our data set here is Train, and
then we want method = "class",

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:08.980
since we're building a
classification tree, and cp

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:13.710
= 0.18.

00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:17.830
Now, let's make predictions on
our test set using this model.

00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:22.620
We'll call our
predictions PredictCV,

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:24.720
and we'll use the
predict function

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:30.880
to make predictions using
the model StevensTreeCV,

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:38.750
the newdata set Test, and we
want to add type = "class",

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:41.930
so that we get
class predictions.

00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:44.240
Now let's create our
confusion matrix,

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:48.800
using the table function, where
we first give the true outcome,

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:55.110
Test$Reverse, and then our
predictions, PredictCV.

00:09:55.110 --> 00:10:01.460
So the accuracy of
this model is 59 + 64,

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:08.620
divided by the total number
in this table, 59 + 18 + 29 +

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:13.500
64, the total number of
observations in our test set.

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:17.980
So the accuracy of
this model is 0.724.

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:21.460
Remember that the accuracy
of our previous CART model

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:24.470
was 0.659.

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:26.820
Cross validation helps
us make sure we're

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:29.360
selecting a good
parameter value,

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:31.340
and often this
will significantly

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:33.530
increase the accuracy.

00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:37.090
If we had already happened to
select a good parameter value,

00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:40.190
then the accuracy might
not of increased that much.

00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:42.580
But by using cross
validation, we

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:47.020
can be sure that we're selecting
a smart parameter value.
