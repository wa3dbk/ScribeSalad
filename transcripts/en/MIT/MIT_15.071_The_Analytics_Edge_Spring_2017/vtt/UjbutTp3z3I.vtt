00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.350
In this video, we'll solve our
simple example in LibreOffice.

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:11.310
Go ahead and open
the spreadsheet,

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:12.100
IMRT_SimpleExample.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.400
At the top of the spreadsheet,
you should see our data.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.560
For each beamlet
and each voxel, we

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.200
have the dose that
that beamlet gives

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.560
to that voxel at unit intensity.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.860
So we have this data for voxel
one, voxel two, voxel three,

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.750
all the way up to voxel nine.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.650
Each row corresponds to
one of the six beamlets.

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:41.810
This is the data that
we saw on the slides

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:44.200
in the previous video.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.660
Below the data, we've outlined
our decision variables,

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.530
which are the intensities
of the beamlets.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.560
So for beamlets one through six,
we have one decision variable.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.700
These six decision variables
are outlined in yellow.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.770
Right now, the
decision variable cells

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.870
are blank, because the values
will be filled in by Solver.

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.440
Below the decision variables,
we have our objective.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.160
Our objective is to minimize the
total dose to healthy tissue.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:20.750
The healthy-tissue voxels are
voxels one, three, five, six,

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.200
and nine.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.320
So let's go ahead and build
our objective in the blue cell

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.070
here.

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.150
So first, we want to
add up the total dose

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.310
that each beamlet
gives to voxel one.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.690
So here we'll use
the function that we

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.060
used in the previous
lecture, sumproduct.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.840
So type an equals sign,
and then sumproduct,

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.400
and select all of the decision
variables, semicolon, and then

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.420
all of the doses.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.440
This will add up the total
dose that beamlet one gives

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.400
to voxel one, plus the
total dose beamlet two

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.910
gives to voxel one,
plus the total dose

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.700
beamlet three gives
to voxel one, etc.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.210
Now we want to repeat this
for voxels three, five, six,

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.460
and nine-- the other
healthy-tissue voxels.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.830
So go ahead and
type a plus sign,

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.540
and then sumproduct, again,
the six decision variables,

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:24.380
semicolon, and this time, select
the dose data for voxel three.

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.240
Now let's repeat this again,
but this time for voxel five.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.620
So sumproduct, and
then the decision

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.050
variables, and the dose
data for voxel five.

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:40.410
Now for voxel six, sumproduct,
the decision variables,

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.170
semicolon, and the dose
data for voxel six.

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.650
And lastly, we're going to add
the sumproduct of the decision

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:55.900
variables, semicolon, and then
scroll over to voxel nine,

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.620
and select the dose
data for voxel nine.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.480
Close the parentheses,
and hit Enter.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.390
You should see that the
objective has a 0 right now,

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.690
because none of our
decision-variable values

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:07.960
are filled in.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.420
When Solver fills in
our decision variables,

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.040
our objective
value will be here.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.370
Below the objective
is our constraints.

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.520
The first four constraints
make sure that each voxel

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.290
of the tumor is getting
a dose of at least 7.

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.350
The last constraint makes
sure that the spinal cord

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.760
receives a dose
of no more than 5.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.870
Let's go ahead and
construct our constraints.

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.820
For the first four
constraints, the left-hand side

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.100
is going to be the total dose
that that voxel of the tumor

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.190
gets.

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.100
So for voxel two, we
have the left-hand side

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.340
is equal to the
sumproduct of the decision

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:55.210
variables, semicolon, and
then the data for voxel two.

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:57.610
Close the parentheses,
and hit Enter.

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:59.880
We want to make sure
that this value is

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.230
greater than or equal to 7.

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.430
Now let's repeat
this for voxel four.

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.060
So equals sumproduct,
and then, in parentheses,

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.840
select the decision
variables, semicolon,

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.149
and the data for voxel four.

00:04:16.149 --> 00:04:22.260
Again, we also want this one to
be greater than or equal to 7.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.570
Now let's repeat
this for voxel seven.

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:31.140
So sumproduct of the decision
variables, semicolon, and then

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:40.670
the data for voxel seven, again,
greater than or equal to 7.

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:45.250
And lastly, for voxel eight,
we want the sumproduct

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.590
of the decision variables,
and the data for voxel eight

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:58.350
this time to also be
greater than or equal to 7.

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.540
And our last constraint,
we want to make sure

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:03.350
that the total
dose to voxel five,

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:06.170
the spinal cord
voxel-- so sumproduct

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:12.430
of the decision variables, and
then the data for voxel five,

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:17.270
is less than or equal to 5.

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:18.790
The remaining
constraints we have

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:20.570
are the non-negativity
constraints,

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:23.660
which we'll add in
directly in the Solver.

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:29.250
So now go ahead and go to the
Tools menu, and select Solver.

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.770
The Solver window should pop up.

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.870
First we need to tell Solver
what our objective is.

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.690
So go ahead and delete
what's in "Target cell",

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:40.700
and making sure that your
cursor is in "Target cell",

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:43.680
select the blue objective cell.

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.830
Now, we want to change "Maximum"
to "Minimum", because we're

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:51.080
trying to minimize the total
dose to healthy tissue,

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:56.360
and our decision variables
should be the six yellow cells.

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.300
Now let's add in
our constraints.

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.680
So in the first
"Cell reference" box,

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.920
let's select the first
four constraints.

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.350
Because they're all greater
than or equal to constraints,

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:07.710
we can add them in together.

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:11.380
And change the "Operator"
to greater than or equal to,

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:16.400
and then in "Value", select
the four right-hand sides.

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.700
Now let's add in the
spinal-cord constraint.

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:20.850
So in the next "Cell
reference" box,

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:23.360
select the spinal
cord left-hand side,

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.030
make sure that
"Operator" is less than

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:27.910
or equal to, and in
the second "Value" box,

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:31.430
select the spinal
cord, right-hand side.

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:33.720
Now let's add our
non-negativity constraints.

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:37.230
So in the "Cell reference", just
directly pick the six decision

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:45.530
variables, and make
sure the "Operator"

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:51.330
is greater than or equal to, and
the "Value" should just be 0.

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:53.060
Now, in the Options,
make sure you've

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:58.370
selected the Linear
Solver, and click OK.

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:01.710
Now go ahead and hit Solve.

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:03.480
You should see a
solving result that

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.750
says: "Solving
successfully finished.

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:08.490
Result: 22.75".

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:11.750
That's the optimal
objective function value.

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:14.770
Go ahead and select Keep Result.

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:17.240
Now let's take a
look at our solution.

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:19.350
So the optimal
solution is to have

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:23.070
beamlet one at an
intensity 2.25,

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:26.180
beamlet two at an
intensity of 0,

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:28.980
beamlet three at
an intensity of 3,

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:32.420
beamlet four at an
intensity of 3.5,

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:35.430
beamlet five at an
intensity of 2.5,

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:39.270
and beamlet six at
an intensity of 0.

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:42.010
This makes sense,
because beamlet two goes

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:45.620
across the spinal cord,
and beamlet six only

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:48.940
goes down healthy-tissue voxels.

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:50.840
And if we look at
our constraints,

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:55.340
we can double-check that each
tumor voxel is receiving a dose

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:59.400
of at least 7 -- one tumor
voxel gets a dose of 8 --

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:02.340
and the spinal cord is
receiving a dose of 5,

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:05.700
which is the maximum
possible dose.

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:09.660
In the next video, we'll see
an example of a real problem,

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:14.070
and how big the problem is
on an actual tumor case.
