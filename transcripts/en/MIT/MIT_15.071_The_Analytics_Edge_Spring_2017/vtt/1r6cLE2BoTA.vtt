Hi.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.080
This is Iain, and
welcome to the recitation

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.790
for the visualization week.

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.630
Today, we're going to
be discussing examples

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.410
of good and bad visualizations,
and then discussing

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.180
how to make better versions
using our R skills.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.520
Remember, visualization
is an art form,

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.100
and it's inherently subjective.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.430
You should try to form your
own opinions on the material

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:23.380
as we go through it.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.430
So let's get started.
