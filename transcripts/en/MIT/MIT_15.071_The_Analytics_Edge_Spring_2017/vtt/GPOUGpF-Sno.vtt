00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:07.860
In this video we'll use
hierarchical clustering

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:12.160
to cluster the movies in the
movie lens data set by genre.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.150
After we make our
clusters, we'll

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.960
see how they can be used
to make recommendations.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.220
There are two steps to
hierarchical clustering.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.390
First we have to compute the
distances between all data

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.450
points.

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.400
And then we need to
cluster the points.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.350
To compute the distances we
can use the dist function.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:36.320
We only want a cluster
movies on the genre variable,

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.400
not on the title variable, so
we'll cluster on columns two

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.000
through 20.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.220
So let's call the
output distances,

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.710
and we'll use the dist function,
where the first argument is

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:54.460
moviesmovies[2:20], this is what
we want to cluster on.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.520
And the second argument
is method="euclidean",

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.060
meaning that we want to
use euclidean distance.

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.660
Now let's cluster our movies
using the hclust function

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.960
for hierarchical clustering.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.210
We'll call the
output clusterMovies,

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.170
and use hclust where the
first argument is distances,

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.500
the output of the dist function.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.210
And the second argument
is method="ward".

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:30.160
The ward method cares about the
distance between clusters using

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.120
centroid distance, and
also the variance in each

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.440
of the clusters.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.110
Now let's plot the dendrogram
of our clustering algorithm

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.710
by typing plot, and then in
parentheses clusterMovies.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.940
This dendrogram might
look a little strange.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.180
We have all this black
along the bottom.

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.150
Remember that the
dendrogram lists

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.900
all of that data points
along the bottom.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.420
But when there are
over 1,000 data points

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.420
it's impossible to read.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.900
We'll see later how to assign
our clusters to groups so

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.419
that we can analyze which data
points are in which cluster.

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:12.470
So looking at this
dendrogram, how many clusters

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:13.800
would you pick?

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.120
It looks like maybe
three or four clusters

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.120
would be a good choice
according to the dendrogram.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.090
But let's keep our
application in mind, too.

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.050
We probably want more than two,
three, or even four clusters

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.260
of movies to make
recommendations to users.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.829
It looks like
there's a nice spot

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:36.610
down here where
there's 10 clusters.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.870
This is probably better
for our application.

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.400
We could select
even more clusters

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.030
if we want to have very
specific genre groups.

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.900
If you want a lot
of clusters it's

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.750
hard to pick the right
number from the dendrogram.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.610
You need to use your
understanding of the problem

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.020
to pick the number of clusters.

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.400
Let's stick with 10
clusters for now,

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.030
combining what we learned
from the dendrogram

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.590
with our understanding
of the problem.

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:10.010
Now back in our R console we can
label each of the data points

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:11.910
according to what
cluster it belongs

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.940
to using the cutree function.

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.030
So let's type
clusterGroups=cutree(clusterMovies,

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.530
k=10).

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.360
Now let's figure out what
the clusters are like.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.990
We'll use the tapply
function to compute

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:42.250
the percentage of movies
in each genre and cluster.

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.880
So let's type tapply, and then
give us the first argument,

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.970
movies$Action-- we'll
start the action genre--

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:58.790
and then clusterGroups,
and then mean.

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.370
So what does this do?

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.050
It divides our data points
into the 10 clusters

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.290
and then computes
the average value

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.710
of the action variable
for each cluster.

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:11.550
Remember that the
action variable

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:15.320
is a binary variable
with value 0 or 1.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.370
So by computing the
average of this variable

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.519
we're computing the
percentage of movies

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:24.390
in that cluster that
belong in that genre.

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:28.990
So we can see here that
in cluster 2, about 78%

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.360
of the movies have
the action genre

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.390
label, whereas in cluster
4 none of the movies

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:38.940
are labeled as action movies.

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.630
Let's try this
again, but this time

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:43.270
let's look at the romance genre.

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.850
Here we can see that all of
the movies in clusters six

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:56.300
and seven are labeled as
romance movies, whereas only 4%

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.420
of the movies in cluster two
are labeled as romance movies.

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:03.580
We can repeat this
for each genre.

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.050
If you do you can
create a large table

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:10.250
to better analyze the clusters,
which I saved to a spreadsheet.

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:11.110
Lets take a look.

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.810
Here we have in each
column the cluster,

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.740
and in each row the genre.

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.950
I highlighted the
cells that have

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:24.420
a higher than average value.

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:28.390
So we can see here in
cluster 2, as we saw before,

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:32.780
that cluster 2 has a high
number of action movies.

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:36.710
Cluster 1 has a little bit of
everything, some animation,

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:41.390
children's, fantasy,
musicals, war and westerns.

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:44.690
So I'm calling this the
miscellaneous cluster.

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:47.770
Cluster 2 has a lot of
the action, adventure,

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:50.210
and sci-fi movies.

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:55.520
Cluster 3 has the crime,
mystery, thriller movies.

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:00.350
Cluster 4 exclusively
has drama movies.

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:05.040
Cluster 5, exclusively
has comedies.

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:09.880
Cluster 6 has a lot
of the romance movies.

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:14.440
Cluster 7 has movies that are
comedies and romance movies.

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.920
So I'm calling these
the romantic comedies.

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:21.520
Cluster 8 has the documentaries.

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:25.360
Cluster 9 has the movies
that are comedies and dramas,

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.750
so the dramatic comedies.

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:31.410
And cluster 10 has
the horror flicks.

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:34.030
Knowing common movie
genres, these cluster

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:36.610
seem to make a lot of sense.

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:39.380
So now, back in our
rconsole, let's see

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:42.670
how these clusters could be
used in a recommendation system.

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:48.650
Remember that Amy liked
the movie Men in Black.

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:51.810
Let's figure out what
cluster Men in Black is in.

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:56.820
We'll use the subset function
to take a subset of movies

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:59.190
and only look at the movies
where the Title="Men in Black

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:08.000
(1997)".

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.450
Close the quotes
in the parentheses.

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:12.590
I knew that this is the
title of Men in Black

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:16.430
because I looked it
up in our data set.

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:21.660
So it looks like Men in Black
is the 257th row in our data.

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:25.780
So which cluster did
the 257th movie go into?

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:28.490
We can figure this out by
typing clusterGroupsclusterGroups[257].

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:37.400
It looks like Men in
Black went into cluster 2.

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:39.070
That make sense
since we just saw

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:43.680
that cluster 2 is the action,
adventure, sci-fi cluster.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.890
So let's create a new
data set with just

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:47.810
the movies from cluster two.

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:52.130
We'll call it cluster two,
and use the subset function

00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:54.890
to take a subset of
movies only taking

00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:58.730
the observations for which
clusterGroups is equal to 2.

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:03.740
Let's look at the first
10 titles in this cluster.

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:06.240
We can do this by typing
cluster2$Titlecluster2$Title[1:10].

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:16.150
So it looks like good
movies to recommend to Amy,

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:18.440
according to our
clustering algorithm,

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:23.900
would be movies like Apollo
13 and Jurassic Park.

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:26.310
In this video we
saw how clustering

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:29.940
can be applied to create a
movie recommendation system.

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:32.350
In the next video,
we'll conclude

00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:35.850
by learning who ended up winning
the million dollar Netflix

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:37.400
prize.
