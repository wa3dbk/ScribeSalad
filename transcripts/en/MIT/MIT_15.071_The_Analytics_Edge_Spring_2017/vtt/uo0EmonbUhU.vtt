00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.210
Now, as we start to think about
building regression models

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.080
with this data set, we need
to consider the possibility

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.880
that there is
multicollinearity within

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.080
the independent variables.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.580
And there's a good
reason to suspect

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.060
that there would be
multicollinearity amongst

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.790
the variables,
because in some sense,

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.030
they're all measuring
the same thing, which

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:26.620
is how strong the Republican
candidate is performing

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.620
in the particular state.

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.009
So while normally, we would
run the correlation function

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.380
on the training set, in
this case, it doesn't work.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.060
It says, x must be numeric.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.750
And if we go back and look at
the structure of the training

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.850
set, it jumps out why
we're getting this issue.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.230
It's because we're
trying to take

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.150
the correlations of
the names of states,

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.040
which doesn't make any sense.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.950
So to compute the
correlation, we're

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.580
going to want to take the
correlation amongst just

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.080
the independent
variables that we're

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.820
going to be using to
predict, and we can also

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.400
add in the dependent variable
to this correlation matrix.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.550
So I'll take cor
of the training set

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.830
but just limit it to the
independent variables--

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:17.640
Rasmussen, SurveyUSA,
PropR, and DiffCount.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.940
And then also, we'll add in the
dependent variable, Republican.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:27.320
So there we go.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.260
We're seeing a lot
of big values here.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.680
For instance,
SurveyUSA and Rasmussen

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.460
are independent variables that
have a correlation of 0.94,

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.580
which is very, very
large and something

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:40.870
that would be concerning.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.440
It means that probably
combining them

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.800
together isn't going to do much
to produce a working regression

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.670
model.

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.400
So let's first
consider the case where

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.170
we want to build a logistic
regression model with just one

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.250
variable.

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.580
So in this case,
it stands to reason

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.330
that the variable
we'd want to add

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:00.830
would be the one
that is most highly

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.410
correlated with the
outcome, Republican.

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.270
So if we read the
bottom row, which

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.830
is the correlation of each
variable to Republican,

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.220
we see that PropR is
probably the best candidate

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.620
to include in our
single-variable model,

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.490
because it's so
highly correlated,

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.840
meaning it's going to do
a good job of predicting

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.500
the Republican status.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.680
So let's build a model.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.290
We can call it mod1.

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.190
So we'll call the glm function,
predicting Republican,

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.880
using PropR alone.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.940
As always, we'll
pass along the data

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.300
to train with as
our training set.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.720
And because we have
logistic regression,

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.180
we need family = "binomial".

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.170
And we can take a look at
this model using the summary

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.490
function.

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.820
And we can see that
it looks pretty

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.910
nice in terms of
its significance

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.920
and the sign of
the coefficients.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.500
We have a lot of
stars over here.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.380
PropR is the
proportion of the polls

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:06.700
that said the Republican won.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.370
We see that that has a very
high coefficient in terms

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.120
of predicting that the
Republican will win

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.850
in the state, which
makes a lot of sense.

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.930
And we'll note down
that the AIC measuring

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.230
the strength of
the model is 19.8.

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.160
So this seems like a
very reasonable model.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.030
Let's see how it does in
terms of actually predicting

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.440
the Republican outcome
on the training set.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.890
So first, we want to
compute the predictions,

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.130
the predicted probabilities
that the Republican

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.380
is going to win on
the training set.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:41.210
So we'll create a vector
called pred1, prediction one,

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:43.630
then we'll call the
predict function.

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.300
We'll pass it our model one.

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.860
And we're not going
to pass it newdata,

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.410
because we're just
making predictions

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:51.760
on the training set right now.

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.810
We're not looking at
test set predictions.

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:59.300
But we do need to pass it type =
"response" to get probabilities

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.470
out as the predictions.

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.310
And now, we want to see
how well it's doing.

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.650
So if we used a
threshold of 0.5,

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.980
where we said if the
probability is at least 1/2,

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.790
we're going to
predict Republican,

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:11.860
otherwise, we'll
predict Democrat.

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.600
Let's see how that would
do on the training set.

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.269
So we'll want to use
the table function

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:21.010
and look at the training
set Republican value

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.120
against the logical
of whether pred1

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.050
is greater than or equal to 0.5.

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.260
So here, the rows, as usual, are
the outcome -- 1 is Republican,

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:34.950
0 is Democrat.

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.730
And the columns-- TRUE
means that we predicted

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:40.580
Republican, FALSE means
we predicted Democrat.

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.870
So we see that on
the training set,

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.320
this model with one
variable as a prediction

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.550
makes four mistakes,
which is just

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.280
about the same as our
smart baseline model.

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.440
So now, let's see if we can
improve on this performance

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.760
by adding in another variable.

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.890
So if we go back up to
our correlations here,

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:03.640
we're going to be
searching, since there's

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.250
so much multicollinearity,
we might be searching

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.020
for a pair of variables that has
a relatively lower correlation

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.900
with each other, because they
might kind of work together

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.970
to improve the
prediction overall

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:17.250
of the Republican outcome.

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.020
If two variables are
highly, highly correlated,

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.720
they're less likely to
improve predictions together,

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:28.240
since they're so similar in
their correlation structure.

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.760
So it looks like, just looking
at this top left four by four

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.920
matrix, which is the
correlations between all

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:38.260
the independent variables,
basically the least correlated

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:42.530
pairs of variables are either
Rasmussen and DiffCount,

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:45.480
or SurveyUSA and DiffCount.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.800
So the idea would
be to try out one

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.420
of these pairs in our
two-variable model.

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:54.690
So we'll go ahead and try
out SurveyUSA and DiffCount

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:57.520
together in our second model.

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.670
So to save ourselves
some typing,

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:02.830
we can hit up a
few times until we

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:05.740
get to the model
definition for model one.

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.950
And then we can just
change the variables.

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:15.420
In this case, we're now using
SurveyUSA plus DiffCount.

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:18.210
We'll also need to remember to
change the name of our model

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:19.560
from mod1 to mod2.

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:24.160
And now, just like
before, we're going

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.190
to want to compute
out our predictions.

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:33.020
So we'll say pred2 is equal
to the predict of our model 2,

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:34.920
again, with type =
"response", because we

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:36.260
need to get those probabilities.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.230
Again, we're not
passing in newdata.

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:39.650
This is a training
set prediction.

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:46.570
And finally, we can
use the up arrows

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:49.570
to see how our second
model's predictions are doing

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:53.890
at predicting the Republican
outcome in the training set.

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:56.920
And we can see that we
made one less mistake.

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.840
We made three mistakes instead
of four on the training

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.990
set-- so a little better
than the smart baseline

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:04.470
but nothing too impressive.

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:06.310
And the last thing we're
going to want to do

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:09.380
is to actually look at the
model and see if it makes sense.

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:14.250
So we can run summary
of our model two.

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:17.160
And we can see that there are
some things that are pluses.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.760
For instance, the AIC
has a smaller value,

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:22.460
which suggests a stronger model.

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:26.160
And the estimates have, again,
the sign we would expect.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:29.880
So SurveyUSA and DiffCount
both have positive coefficients

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:31.780
in predicting if
the Republican wins

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:33.770
the state, which makes sense.

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:38.080
But a weakness of this model is
that neither of these variables

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:41.790
has a significance
of a star or better,

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:46.400
which means that they are less
significant statistically.

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:48.800
So there are definitely some
strengths and weaknesses

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.850
between the two-variable
and the one-variable model.

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:54.610
We'll go ahead and use
the two-variable model

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:57.890
when we make our predictions
on the testing set.
