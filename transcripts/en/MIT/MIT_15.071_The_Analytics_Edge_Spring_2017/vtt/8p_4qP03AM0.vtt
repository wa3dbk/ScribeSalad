00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.240
In this lecture, we'll discuss
how linear optimization

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.320
is used to design radiation
therapy treatments for cancer

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.560
patients.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.480
Cancer is the
second leading cause

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.680
of death in the United States,
second only to heart disease.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:32.689
There were an estimated 570,000
deaths in 2013 due to cancer.

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:37.110
Additionally, over 1.6
million new cases of cancer

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.560
will be diagnosed in the
United States in 2013.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.580
These trends are also
seen throughout the world.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.670
Worldwide, cancer is a
leading cause of death,

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.570
with 8.2 million deaths in 2012.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.690
Cancer can be treated
using radiation therapy,

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.960
where beams of
high-energy photons

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.930
are fired into the patient
to kill cancerous cells.

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.060
This is a very common
form of treatment

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.510
for many types of cancers,
and in the United States,

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.789
about half of all
cancer patients

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:14.310
undergo some form of
radiation therapy.

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.630
Radiation therapy has a history
going back to the late 1800s.

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.590
X-rays were discovered by
Wilhelm Rontgen in 1895,

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.110
who was later awarded the
first Nobel Prize in Physics.

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.550
Shortly after the
discovery, X-rays

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.130
started being used to
treat skin cancers.

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.289
This image shows an x-ray
of Rontgen's wife's hand.

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:41.330
You can see the
bones in her hand

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.610
as well as her wedding
ring on her finger.

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.090
A few years later
in 1898, radium

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.710
was discovered by
Marie and Pierre Curie.

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.479
They won the Nobel Prize
for this discovery in 1911.

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:59.720
Radium started being used
to treat cancer, as well

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:00.480
as other diseases.

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.760
Later in the 1900s, the first
radiation delivery machines,

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.200
called linear accelerators,
were developed.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:17.930
Then computed tomography, or CT
scans, were invented in 1971.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.520
These discoveries
led to the invention

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.510
of Intensity Modulated
Radiation Therapy, or IMRT,

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.190
in the early 1980s.

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.910
The invention of
IMRT significantly

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.780
improved the ability
of radiation therapy

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.290
to target cancerous cells.

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.020
To reach the tumor,
radiation passes

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.760
through healthy tissue
and therefore damages

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.370
both healthy and
cancerous tissue.

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.280
This damage to
healthy tissue can

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.810
lead to undesirable
side effects that

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.520
reduce post-treatment
quality of life.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.980
For example, blistering
and burning of skin

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.160
can occur because of the
damage to healthy skin cells.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.300
For this reason,
we want the dose

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.140
to fit the tumor as
closely as possible

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.810
to reduce the dose
to healthy tissue.

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.700
This became possible with
the invention of IMRT.

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:20.670
In IMRT, the intensity profile
of each beam is non-uniform.

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.360
Before IMRT, each beam had
to have the same intensity,

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.460
so the tumor could not
be targeted very well.

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:32.060
But by using non-uniform
intensity profiles,

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.190
the radiation dose can
better fit the tumor.

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.930
Let's see what this looks like.

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.620
In this image, we have
a person's body outlined

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.010
in black, and then
the target, or tumor,

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.750
and two critical
structures also outlined.

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.400
We would like to maximize
the radiation to the target,

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.110
while minimizing the
dose to healthy tissue,

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.230
and especially to the
critical structures.

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.820
Using traditional
radiation therapy,

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.690
each of the three beams
has the same intensity

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.010
throughout the beam.

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.030
So to deliver enough
radiation to the tumor,

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.870
we also have to deliver a
significant amount of radiation

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.970
to the critical structures
and to other healthy tissue.

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.830
But by using IMRT, we
can change the intensity

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.160
throughout each beam
to make it non-uniform.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.820
Some pieces of
the beam will have

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.620
a higher intensity than others.

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.740
This allows us to deliver the
necessary amount of radiation

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.120
to the tumor, while
minimizing the total radiation

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.680
to healthy tissue, and thus,
the critical structures

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.440
get significantly
less radiation.

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.450
Each of the pieces of the beam
is referred to as a beamlet.

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:51.390
So in IMRT, we
decide the intensity

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:53.409
of each of the
beamlets so that we

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:55.730
can target the
tumor with radiation

00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:00.170
while minimizing the
radiation to healthy tissue.

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:02.820
So in designing
an IMRT treatment,

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.950
the fundamental problem is
-- how should the beamlet

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:09.850
intensities be selected to
deliver a therapeutic dose

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:14.670
to the tumor and to minimize
damage to healthy tissue?

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:17.440
This is the problem that
we'll address in this lecture,

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.570
using linear optimization.
