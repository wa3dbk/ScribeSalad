00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.070
This is a story of D2Hawkeye,
a medical data mining

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:18.720
company located in
Waltham, Massachusetts.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.790
The company was founded by Chris
Kryder, a medical doctor who

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.940
was an MIT physician
in the 1990s.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.820
The company was founded in 2001.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.530
I have been in the board
of this company since 2002.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.730
The company combines
expert knowledge

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.110
and databases with analytics
to improve quality and course

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.120
management in health care.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.670
The company was located
in Waltham, Massachusetts.

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:55.950
It grew very fast and was sold
to Verisk Analytics in 2009.

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:01.240
The overall process that
D2Hawkeye uses is as follows.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.700
It starts with
medical claims that

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:11.630
consist of diagnoses,
procedures, and drugs.

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.350
These medical claims
are then processed

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.150
via process of aggregation,
cleaning, and normalization.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:28.340
This data then enters
secure databases

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.450
on which predictive
models are applied.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.600
The output of predictive
models are specific reports

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.940
that give insight to
the various questions

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.770
that D2Hawkeye
aspires to answer.

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:54.330
The company tries to improve
health care case management.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:00.440
Specifically, it tries to
identify high-risk patients,

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.410
work with patients to manage
treatment and associated costs,

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.180
and arrange specialist care.

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.780
Medical costs, of course,
is a serious matter

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.300
both for the patient as
well as the provider.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.180
Being able to predict this
cost is an important problem

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.170
that interests both the patients
as well as the providers.

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.520
The overall goal of
D2Hawkeye is to improve

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.150
the quality of cost predictions.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.230
D2Hawkeye had many
different types of clients.

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.400
The most important were
third party administrators

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.880
of medical claims.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.000
Third party administrators
are companies

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.240
hired by the employer who manage
the claims of the employees.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.320
Now the type of clients were
case management companies,

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.120
benefits consultants,
and health plans.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:03.450
The company grew and by 2009,
it analyzed monthly millions

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:09.040
of people through the
analytic platform it built.

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.830
This corresponded to
thousands of employers

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.050
that were processed monthly.

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.860
To analyze the data,
the company used

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.440
what we call a
pre-analytics approach.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.200
This was based on the human
judgment of physicians

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.670
who manually analyze patient
histories and developed

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.620
medical rules.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.970
Of course, this
involved human judgment,

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.850
utilized a limited
set of data, it

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:49.400
was often costly, and
somewhat inefficient.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.840
The key question we
analyze in this lecture

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.260
is "Can we use
analytics instead?"
