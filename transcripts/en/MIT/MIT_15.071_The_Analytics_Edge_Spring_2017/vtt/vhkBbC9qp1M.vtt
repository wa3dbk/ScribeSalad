00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.130
In this lecture, we will
discuss how visualization

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.110
can offer insights in
the area of policing

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.740
in urban environments.

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.780
The explosion of
computerized data

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.130
affects all parts of
society, including policing.

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.930
In the past, human
judgment and experience

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.510
was the only tool in identifying
patterns in criminal behavior.

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:34.450
Police forces around the
United States and the world

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.390
are augmenting human
judgment with analytics.

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.400
Los Angeles police
worked for months

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.590
to catch Manson
and his followers.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.480
These days the LAPD is on an
offensive to prevent crime.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.950
Its latest weapon is
a computer program

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.940
that can actually predict
where crimes will happen.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.700
And justice
correspondent Bob Orr

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.840
has a first look at the results.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.130
In the Foothill Division
north of downtown Los Angeles,

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:00.590
police are patrolling
the largely

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.150
working-class neighborhoods
with specially marked maps.

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.550
The small red squares
are hot spots,

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.080
where computers project
property crimes are most likely.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.330
It's called predictive policing.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.010
A program which Captain
Sean Malinowski says

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.500
puts officers on the
scene before crimes occur.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.350
65% of our crimes are
burglary, grand theft auto,

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:24.980
and burglary for motor vehicle.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.810
And that's what these
boxes represent.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.840
That's a pretty small
box, 500 feet by 500 feet.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.410
Yes, it is a small area.

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:34.539
These crime
prediction boxes come

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:37.390
from the same kind of
mathematical calculation used

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.300
to predict earthquakes
and aftershocks.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.030
By analyzing the times, dates,
and places of recent crimes

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.200
computers project hot spots for
burglaries, break-ins, and car

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.490
thefts.

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.770
LA's Police Chief
Charlie Beck says

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.900
increasing police patrols
inside those boxes

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.920
denies criminals opportunity.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.200
The real measure of this is
not how many people you catch,

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.200
it's how much crime you prevent.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.600
I love catching people.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.800
It's what I live for.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.100
But, what I'd rather do is live
in a place and work in a place

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:10.389
where crime didn't happen.

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:14.260
Chief Beck, a 35-year veteran
and the father of two LAPD

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.829
officers, has faced
some skepticism

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:19.079
in selling the
predictive concept.

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:19.980
You're a street cop.

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.120
I am.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.950
So somebody comes to you with
a computer program that says,

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.700
here we're going to
predict the future,

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.079
we're going to tell you where
crime is going to occur.

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:29.510
Aren't some of the guys
on the street just going

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.420
to roll their eyes
and say, oh come on?

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:32.170
Well, of course.

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.920
I mean, that's the
nature of human beings.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.350
I mean everybody thinks that
they do their profession as

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.850
well as it can be done already,
so they don't need any help.

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.240
If this old street
cop can change the way

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.230
that he thinks about
this stuff, then I

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.460
know that my kids
can do the same.

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.860
The LAPD began testing the
predictive policing model here

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.090
in the Foothill
Division in November,

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.579
and the early results
are encouraging.

00:02:54.579 --> 00:03:01.170
Burglaries are down 33%, and
violent crime is also down 21%.

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.920
That success will allow
Beck to expand the program

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.740
to other parts of the city and
leverage limited resources.

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.080
I'm not going to get more money.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.820
I'm not going to get more cops.

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.100
But I have to be better
at using what I have,

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.260
and that's what predictive
policing is about.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.400
It's also about driving
the crime rate lower.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.060
Crime here has dropped
nine straight years.

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.380
With these small red
boxes, LA is aiming for 10.

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.800
Bob Orr, CBS News, Los Angeles.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.590
The Los Angeles Police
Chief Charlie Beck

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.310
writes, "I'm not going
to get more money.

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.260
I'm not going to get more cops.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.860
I have to be better
at using what I have,

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.360
and that's what predictive
policing is about.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.200
If this old street
cop can change the way

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.579
that he thinks about
this stuff, then I

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:54.450
know that my officers
can do the same."

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.050
Let me comment on the
role of analytics.

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:59.600
The analytical tools you
have learned in this class

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.780
can be used to make these
predictive policing models

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:03.700
possible.

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.820
However, communicating the
results of these models

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:07.970
is critical.

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.590
A linear regression
output table will not

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.500
be of use to a police
person on patrol.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.459
Visualization bridges the
gap between the analytics

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.380
and the end user.
