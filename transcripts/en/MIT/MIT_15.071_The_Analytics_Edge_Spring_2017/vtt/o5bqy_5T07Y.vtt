Hi.

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:08.400
My name is Natalie, and I will
be leading this recitation.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.000
We will review hierarchical and
k-means clustering techniques

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.700
and apply them to segment
gray scale images--

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.430
in particular, MRI brain images.

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.470
Then we will conclude by
overviewing all the analytics

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.610
tools we have seen
so far in this class

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:24.760
to prepare for the
class competition.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.700
Let's get started.
