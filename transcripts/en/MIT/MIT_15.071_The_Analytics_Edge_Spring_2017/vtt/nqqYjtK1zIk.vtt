00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.950
In this video, we'll create a
basic scatterplot using ggplot.

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.570
Let's start by
reading in our data.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.500
We'll be using the
same data set we

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.370
used during week one, WHO.csv.

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:22.850
So let's call it WHO and
use the read.csv function

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.550
to read in the
data file WHO.csv.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.670
Make sure you're in the
directory containing

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:30.910
this file first.

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.610
Now, let's take a look at
the structure of the data

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.040
using the str function.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.110
We can see that we have 194
observations, or countries,

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.090
and 13 different variables-- the
name of the country, the region

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.750
the country's in, the
population in thousands,

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.500
the percentage of the
population under 15 or over 60,

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.190
the fertility rate or average
number of children per woman,

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.950
the life expectancy in years,
the child mortality rate,

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:08.840
which is the number of children
who die by age five per 1,000

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:15.789
births, the number of cellular
subscribers per 100 population,

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:19.960
the literacy rate among
adults older than 15,

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.300
the gross national
income per capita,

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.080
the percentage of male children
enrolled in primary school,

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.470
and the percentage of
female children enrolled

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.620
in primary school.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.940
In week one, the very
first plot we made in R

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.750
was a scatterplot
of fertility rate

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.320
versus gross national income.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.920
Let's make this plot again,
just like we did in week one.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.170
So we'll use the plot function
and give as the first variable

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.680
WHO$GNI, and then give
as the second variable,

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.430
WHO$FertilityRate.

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.140
This plot shows us that
a higher fertility rate

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.520
is correlated with
a lower income.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.380
Now, let's redo
this scatterplot,

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.110
but this time using ggplot.

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.270
We'll see how ggplot can be
used to make more visually

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.770
appealing and
complex scatterplots.

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:23.050
First, we need to install
and load the ggplot2 package.

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.950
So first type
install.packages("ggplot2").

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.850
When the CRAN mirror
window pops up,

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.840
make sure to pick a
location near you.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.070
Then, as soon as the
package is done installing

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.260
and you're back at
the blinking cursor,

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.170
load the package with
the library function.

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.800
Now, remember we need
at least three things

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.680
to create a plot using ggplot--
data, an aesthetic mapping

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.020
of variables in the data
frame to visual output,

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.510
and a geometric object.

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.140
So first, let's
create the ggplot

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.640
object with the data and
the aesthetic mapping.

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.360
We'll save it to the
variable scatterplot,

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.329
and then use the
ggplot function, where

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:21.470
the first argument is the
name of our data set, WHO,

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.590
which specifies the data to
use, and the second argument

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.750
is the aesthetic mapping, aes.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.070
In parentheses,
we have to decide

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:34.960
what we want on the x-axis and
what we want on the y-axis.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:38.380
We want the x-axis
to be GNI, and we

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.810
want the y-axis to
be FertilityRate.

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.400
Go ahead and close both sets
of parentheses, and hit Enter.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.440
Now, we need to tell
ggplot what geometric

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.480
objects to put in the plot.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.060
We could use bars, lines,
points, or something else.

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.560
This is a big difference between
ggplot and regular plotting

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.690
in R. You can build
different types of graphs

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.670
by using the same ggplot object.

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.820
There's no need to learn
one function for bar

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:14.290
graphs, a completely different
function for line graphs, etc.

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.839
So first, let's just create a
straightforward scatterplot.

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:22.450
So the geometry we
want to add is points.

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:26.430
We can do this by typing the
name of our ggplot object,

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.690
scatterplot, and then adding
the function, geom_point().

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.120
If you hit Enter, you should
see a new plot in the Graphics

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.080
window that looks similar
to our original plot,

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.980
but there are already a
few nice improvements.

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:47.270
One is that we don't have the
data set name with a dollar

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.140
sign in front of the
label on each axis, just

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:53.030
the variable name.

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:54.970
Another is that we
have these nice grid

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.640
lines in the background
and solid points

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.880
that pop out from
the background.

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.690
We could have made a
line graph just as easily

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:05.780
by changing point to line.

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:09.750
So in your R console, hit
the up arrow, and then just

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.410
delete "point" and type
"line" and hit Enter.

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.020
Now, you can see a line
graph in the Graphics window.

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.290
However, a line doesn't
really make sense

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:21.880
for this particular plot,
so let's switch back

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.200
to our points, just by hitting
the up arrow twice and hitting

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.890
Enter.

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:31.630
In addition to specifying that
the geometry we want is points,

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.010
we can add other options,
like the color, shape,

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:37.080
and size of the points.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.460
Let's redo our plot with blue
triangles instead of circles.

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.240
To do that, go ahead and hit
the up arrow in your R console,

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.640
and then in the empty
parentheses for geom_point,

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.850
we're going to specify some
properties of the points.

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:57.920
We want the color to be equal
to "blue", the size to equal 3--

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.110
we'll make the points
a little bigger --

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:03.190
and the shape equals 17.

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:06.760
This is the shape number
corresponding to triangles.

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.760
If you hit Enter, you
should now see in your plot

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:13.320
blue triangles
instead of black dots.

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.120
Let's try another option.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:21.310
Hit the up arrow again, and
change "blue" to "darkred",

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:24.460
and change shape to 8.

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:27.720
Now, you should
see dark red stars.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.840
There are many different
colors and shapes

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.480
that you can specify.

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:36.320
We've provided some information
in the text below this video.

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.430
Now, let's add a
title to the plot.

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:41.010
You can do that by
hitting the up arrow,

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:45.740
and then at the very end
of everything, add ggtitle,

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:48.210
and then in parentheses
in quotes, the title

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:49.750
you want to give your plot.

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:53.200
In our case, we'll
call it "Fertility Rate

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.240
vs. Gross National Income".

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:01.070
If you look at your
plot again, you

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:05.610
should now see that it has
a nice title at the top.

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:08.160
Now, let's save
our plot to a file.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:12.450
We can do this by first
saving our plot to a variable.

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:15.190
So in your R console,
hit the up arrow,

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:18.430
and scroll to the
beginning of the line.

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:21.260
Before scatterplot,
type fertilityGNIplot

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:29.080
= and then everything else.

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:31.420
This will save our
scatterplot to the variable,

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:32.130
fertilityGNIplot.

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:38.830
Now, let's create a file we
want to save our plot to.

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:41.120
We can do that with
the PDF function.

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:43.700
And then in parentheses
and quotes, type the name

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:45.080
you want your file to have.

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:46.180
We'll call it MyPlot.pdf.

00:07:50.159 --> 00:07:53.100
Now, let's just print our plot
to that file with the print

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:54.730
function -- so
print(fertilityGNIplot).

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:07.890
And lastly, we just have to type
dev.off() to close the file.

00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:11.670
Now, if you look at the
folder where WHO.csv is,

00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:15.330
you should see another
file called MyPlot.pdf,

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:17.850
containing the plot we made.

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:20.350
In the next video,
we'll see how to create

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:23.990
more advanced
scatterplots using ggplot.
