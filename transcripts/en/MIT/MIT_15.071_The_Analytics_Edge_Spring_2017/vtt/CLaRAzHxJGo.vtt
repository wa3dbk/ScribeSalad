00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:11.750
In this lecture, we'll
see how analytics

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.330
can be used to predict the
outcomes of cases in the United

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.580
States Supreme Court.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.740
This seems like a very
unconventional use

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.060
of analytics, but in 2002 a
group of political science

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.600
and law academics decided to
test if a model can do better

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.590
than a group of
experts at predicting

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.580
the decisions of
the Supreme Court.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.590
In this case, a very
interpretable analytics method

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:42.340
was used, called classification
and regression trees.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.520
The legal system of
the United States

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.840
operates at the
state level and at

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.600
the federal or
country-wide level.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.460
The federal level is
necessary to deal with cases

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.560
beyond the scope of state law,
like disputes between states,

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.690
and violations of federal laws.

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.900
The federal court is
divided into three levels--

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:08.590
district courts, circuit
courts, and the Supreme Court.

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.830
Cases start at the
district courts,

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.480
where an initial decision
is made about the case.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.310
The circuit courts hear appeals
from the district courts,

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.260
and can change the
decision that was made.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.830
The Supreme Court
is the highest level

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.120
in the American legal system
and makes the final decision

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.620
on cases.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.810
The Supreme Court
of the United States

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.130
consists of nine
judges, or justices,

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.580
who are appointed
by the President.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.960
This image shows the nine
Supreme Court justices

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.420
from the time period
1994 through 2005.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.310
This was the longest
period of time

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.200
with the same set of
justices in over 180 years.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.150
The people appointed as Supreme
Court justices are usually

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.460
distinguished judges,
professors of law,

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.690
or state or federal atttorneys.

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.870
The Supreme Court of the
United States, or SCOTUS,

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.270
decides on the most difficult
and controversial cases

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.300
in the United States.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.810
These cases often
involve an interpretation

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.110
of the Constitution, and have
significant social, political,

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.310
and economic consequences.

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.190
There have been many significant
and groundbreaking decisions

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.180
made by the Supreme Court.

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.610
These are a few notable
decisions that were made.

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.500
In 1942, the Supreme
Court decided

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.250
on the Wickard v. Filburn case.

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.360
This case recognized the power
of the federal government

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.050
to regulate economic activity.

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.060
Filburn was a farmer,
who was growing

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.510
wheat for on-farm consumption.

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.000
However, the US had established
limits on wheat production,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.420
and Filburn was
exceeding those limits.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.930
So even though the extra
wheat he was producing

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.350
was for his own use and he had
no intention of selling it,

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.110
he was forced to destroy it.

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.380
In 1973, the Supreme Court
decided on the Roe v. Wade

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.470
case, one of the most
well-known cases to this day.

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.790
They decided to legalize
abortion, and by doing this,

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.570
prompted a national debate
that continues today

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.680
about the legality of abortion.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.140
In 2000, the Supreme
Court actually

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.510
decided the outcome of
the presidential election.

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.190
The race was so close
in the state of Florida,

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.020
that a recount of the
ballots was required.

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.610
But the Florida Secretary
of State certified

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.600
that President Bush was the
winner before the recount

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.190
could be completed.

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.470
The case then went
to the Supreme Court

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.030
where it was ruled that all
ballots needed to be recounted.

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.329
But since this could not be
done before the winner had

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:49.500
to be declared, President
Bush won the state of Florida,

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.210
and thus, the presidency.

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:55.550
A very recent case from
2012 dealt with the Patient

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:58.390
Protection and Affordable
Care Act, commonly

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.580
called ObamaCare, which
requires most Americans

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.160
to have health insurance.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.280
The Supreme Court
upheld this requirement.

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.860
Since non-profits,
voters, and anybody

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.830
interested in
long-term planning can

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.089
benefit from knowing the
outcomes of the Supreme Court

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:19.560
cases before they
happen, legal academics

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.010
and political
scientists regularly

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.750
make predictions of
Supreme Court decisions

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.260
from detailed studies of the
cases and individual justices.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.090
In 2002, Andrew
Martin, a professor

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.940
of political science at
Washington University in St.

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.520
Louis, decided to
instead predict

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.780
decisions using a statistical
model built from data.

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.040
Together with his
colleagues, he decided

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.170
to test the model against
a panel of experts.

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:49.550
They wanted to see if an
analytical model could

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.690
outperform the
expertise and intuition

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:53.970
of a large group of experts.

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.150
Martin used a method called
classification and regression

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.250
trees, or CART.

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.620
In this case, the
outcome is binary.

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.650
Will the Supreme Court affirm
the case or reject the case?

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.720
He could have used logistic
regression for this,

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.900
but logistic regression models
are not easily interpretable.

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.780
The model coefficients
in logistic regression

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.600
indicate the importance and
relative effect variables,

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.900
but do not give a
simple explanation

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.510
of how a decision is made.

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.660
In this lecture, we'll
discuss the method of CART,

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.480
and a related method
called random forests.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.120
We will then see if these
methods can actually

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.380
outperform experts in predicting
the outcome of Supreme Court

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:41.790
cases.
