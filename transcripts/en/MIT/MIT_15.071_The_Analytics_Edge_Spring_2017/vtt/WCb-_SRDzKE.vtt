Hi.

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:06.760
My name is Ian, and
I will be presenting

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:08.530
a recitation for this week.

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:10.260
We will be discussing
regression trees

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.620
and applying them to the
house price data from Boston.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.830
We will also consider some
alternative visualizations

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.100
of both our model and our data.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.120
So let's get started.
