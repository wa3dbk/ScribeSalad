00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.640
Now that we have identified
a set of risk factors,

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:12.720
let's use this data to predict
the 10 year risk of CHD.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.190
First, we'll randomly
split our patients

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.420
into a training set
and a testing set.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.830
Then, we'll use
logistic regression

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.790
to predict whether or not
a patient experienced CHD

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:28.640
within 10 years of
the first examination.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.800
Keep in mind that all
of the risk factors

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.780
were collected at the first
examination of the patients.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.320
After building our model, we'll
evaluate the predictive power

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.850
of the model on the test set.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.730
Let's go to R and create our
logistic regression model.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.220
In our R console, we'll
call our data set framingham

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:56.200
and use the read.csv function
to read in the data file

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.910
"framingham.csv".

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.320
Remember to navigate to
the directory containing

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.930
the file "framingham.csv"
before reading in the data.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.960
Let's take a look at our data
by using the str function.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.800
We have data for 4,240
patients and 16 variables.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.470
We have the demographic
risk factors male, age,

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.240
and education; the
behavioral risk

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.880
factors currentSmoker
and cigsPerDay;

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.840
the medical history risk
factors BPMeds, prevalentStroke,

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.500
prevalentHyp, and diabetes;
and the physical exam risk

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:50.600
factors totChol, sysBP, diaBP,
BMI, heartRate, and glucose

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.890
level.

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.940
The last variable is the
outcome or dependent variable,

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.940
whether or not the
patient developed

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.360
CHD in the next 10 years.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.760
Now let's split our data into a
training set and a testing set

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.320
using sample.split like we
did in the previous lecture.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.380
We first need to load
the library caTools.

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.579
Now, let's set our seed
and create our split.

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:25.829
We'll start by setting
our seed to 1000,

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:31.230
and then use the sample.split
function to create the split.

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.140
The first argument is
the outcome variable

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.060
framingham$TenYearCHD.

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.890
And the second argument
is the percentage of data

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.880
that we want in the training
set or the SplitRatio.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.620
Here, we'll put 65% of the
data in the training set.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.300
When you have more
data like we do here,

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.410
you can afford to put less
data in the training set

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.650
and more in the testing set.

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.610
This will increase
our confidence

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.480
in the ability of the
model to extend to new data

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.340
since we have a larger
test set, and still

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.310
give us enough data
in the training set

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.060
to create our model.

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.000
You typically want to put
somewhere between 50% and 80%

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.130
of the data in the training set.

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.040
Now, let's split up
our data using subset.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.190
We'll call our
training set "train"

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.400
and use the subset function
to take a subset of framingham

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.310
and take the observations for
which split is equal to TRUE.

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.730
We'll call our
testing set "test"

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.890
and again use the
subset function

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.690
to take a subset of
framingham and take

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.400
the observations for
which split equals FALSE.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.780
Now we're ready to build
our logistic regression

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.280
model using the training set.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:02.340
Let's call it framinghamLog,
and we'll use the glm function

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.160
like we did in the
previous lecture

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.800
to create a logistic
regression model.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.510
We'll use a nice
little trick here

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.730
where we predict our
dependent variable

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.450
using all of the other
variables in the data set

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.810
as independent variables.

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.120
First, type the name of
the dependent variable,

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:25.910
TenYearCHD, followed by the
tilde and then a period.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.800
This will use all of
the other variables

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.610
in the data set as
independent variables

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.260
and is used in
place of listing out

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.150
all of the independent
variables' names separated

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.420
by the plus sign.

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:43.340
Be careful doing
this with data sets

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.380
that have identifying
variables like a patient ID

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.780
or name since you
wouldn't want to use

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.380
these as independent variables.

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.100
Following the period, we
need to give the argument

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:59.409
that defines the data
set to use, data = train.

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:02.890
And then, the final argument
for a logistic regression model

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:04.820
is family = binomial.

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:09.500
Let's take a look at the
summary of our model.

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:22.860
It looks like male,
age, prevalent stroke,

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:27.090
total cholesterol, systolic
blood pressure, and glucose

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:29.960
are all significant
in our model.

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.680
Cigarettes per day and
prevalent hypertension

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.159
are almost significant.

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:39.220
All of significant variables
have positive coefficients,

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.070
meaning that higher
values in these variables

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:44.240
contribute to a
higher probability

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.850
of 10-year coronary
heart disease.

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:50.540
Now, let's use this
model to make predictions

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:51.950
on our test set.

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:56.260
We'll call our
predictions predictTest

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.370
and use the predict
function, which

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:03.190
takes as arguments the name
of our model, framinghamLog,

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:08.790
then type = "response",
which gives us probabilities,

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:16.670
and lastly newdata = test,
the name of our testing set.

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:19.770
Now, let's use a
threshold value of 0.5

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:22.360
to create a confusion matrix.

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:26.580
We'll use the table function
and give as the first argument,

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:33.590
the actual values,
test$TenYearCHD,

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:36.990
and then as the second
argument our predictions,

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:42.190
predictTest &gt; 0.5.

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:46.600
With a threshold of 0.5,
we predict an outcome of 1,

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:49.630
the true column, very rarely.

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:53.610
This means that our model
rarely predicts a 10-year CHD

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:56.770
risk above 50%.

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:59.690
What is the accuracy
of this model?

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:05.280
Well, it's the sum of the cases
we get right, 1069 plus 11,

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:08.580
divided by the total number
of observations in our data

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:15.750
set, 1069 + 6 + 187 + 11.

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:21.720
So the accuracy of our
model is about 84.8%.

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:24.840
We need to compare this to the
accuracy of a simple baseline

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:26.060
method.

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:28.900
The more frequent outcome
in this case is 0,

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:34.680
so the baseline method would
always predict 0 or no CHD.

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:40.290
This baseline method would
get an accuracy of 1069

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:46.710
+ 6-- this is the total number
of true negative cases--

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:50.380
divided by the total number
of observations in our data

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:57.130
set, 1069 + 6 + 187 + 11.

00:07:57.130 --> 00:08:03.590
So the baseline model would
get an accuracy of about 84.4%.

00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:08.330
So our model barely beats the
baseline in terms of accuracy.

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:12.490
But do we still have a valuable
model by varying the threshold?

00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:15.790
Let's compute the
out-of-sample AUC.

00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:21.630
To do this, we first need
to load the ROCR package.

00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:24.040
And then, we'll use
the prediction function

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:28.310
of the ROCR package to
make our predictions.

00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:33.440
Let's call the output of that
ROCRpred and use the prediction

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:37.360
function, which takes as a
first argument our predictions,

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:41.610
predictTest, and then as
a second argument the true

00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:42.900
outcome, test$TenYearCHD.

00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:49.990
Then, we need to type
as.numeric(performance(ROCRpred,

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:50.690
"auc")@y.values).

00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:18.060
This will give us the AUC
value on our testing set.

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:22.050
So we have an AUC of
about 74% on our test set,

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:25.210
which means that the model can
differentiate between low risk

00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:29.010
patients and high risk
patients pretty well.

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:33.070
As we saw in R, we were able
to build a logistic regression

00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:36.520
model with a few
interesting properties.

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:41.440
It rarely predicted
10-year CHD risk above 50%.

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:44.870
So the accuracy of the model
was very close to the baseline

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:46.120
model.

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:49.490
However, the model could
differentiate between low risk

00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:52.720
patients and high risk
patients pretty well

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:57.140
with an out-of-sample
AUC of 0.74.

00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:59.960
Additionally, some of
the significant variables

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:04.490
suggest possible
interventions to prevent CHD.

00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:09.240
We saw that more cigarettes per
day, higher cholesterol, higher

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:12.900
systolic blood pressure,
and higher glucose levels

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:15.480
all increased risk.

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.500
Later in the lecture,
we'll discuss

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:19.720
some medical interventions
that are currently

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:22.750
used to prevent CHD.
