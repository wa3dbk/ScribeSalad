00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:06.250
Now that we've
prepared our data set,

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:08.780
let's use CART to build
a predictive model.

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.930
First, we need to load the
necessary packages in our R

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:17.300
Console by typing
library(rpart),

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.510
and then library(rpart.plot).

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.860
Now let's build our model.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:34.760
We'll call it tweetCART, and
we'll use the rpart function

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.450
to predict Negative using
all of the other variables

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.890
as our independent variables
and the data set trainSparse.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.880
We'll add one more argument
here, which is method = "class"

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.050
so that the rpart function
knows to build a classification

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.320
model.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.660
We're just using the
default parameter settings

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.920
so we won't add anything
for minbucket or cp.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.959
Now let's plot the tree
using the prp function.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.730
Our tree says that if the
word "freak" is in the tweet,

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:17.830
then predict TRUE, or
negative sentiment.

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:19.870
If the word "freak"
is not in the tweet,

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.760
but the word "hate"
is, again predict TRUE.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.090
If neither of these two
words are in the tweet,

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.240
but the word "wtf" is, also
predict TRUE, or negative

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.650
sentiment.

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.450
If none of these three
words are in the tweet,

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.500
then predict FALSE, or
non-negative sentiment.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.500
This tree makes
sense intuitively

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.300
since these three
words are generally

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.220
seen as negative words.

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.050
Now, let's go back
to our R Console

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.380
and evaluate the numerical
performance of our model

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.690
by making predictions
on the test set.

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.990
We'll call our
predictions predictCART.

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.310
And we'll use the
predict function

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:10.960
to predict using our model
tweetCART on the new data set

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:11.460
testSparse.

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.870
We'll add one more argument,
which is type = "class"

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.960
to make sure we get
class predictions.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.430
Now let's make our
confusion matrix

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.520
using the table function.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.040
We'll give as the first
argument the actual outcomes,

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.450
testSparse$Negative, and
then as the second argument,

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.300
our predictions, predictCART.

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.260
To compute the
accuracy of our model,

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.640
we add up the numbers on
the diagonal, 294 plus 18--

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.590
these are the observations
we predicted correctly--

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.120
and divide by the total number
of observations in the table,

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.360
or the total number of
observations in our test set.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.940
So the accuracy of our
CART model is about 0.88.

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.600
Let's compare this to
a simple baseline model

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.160
that always predicts
non-negative.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.930
To compute the accuracy
of the baseline model,

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.760
let's make a table of just
the outcome variable Negative.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.290
So we'll type table,
and then in parentheses,

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:21.120
testSparse$Negative.

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.120
This tells us that
in our test set

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.780
we have 300 observations
with non-negative sentiment

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.450
and 55 observations
with negative sentiment.

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.450
So the accuracy of
a baseline model

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.760
that always predicts
non-negative

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:48.340
would be 300 divided
by 355, or 0.845.

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.360
So our CART model does better
than the simple baseline model.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.200
How about a random forest model?

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.940
How well would that do?

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.380
Let's first load the
random forest package

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:05.680
with library(randomForest),
and then we'll

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.080
set the seed to
123 so that we can

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.750
replicate our model
if we want to.

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.200
Keep in mind that even if
you set the seed to 123,

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.800
you might get a different
random forest model than me

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.820
depending on your
operating system.

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.820
Now, let's create our model.

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:30.570
We'll call it tweetRF and
use the randomForest function

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:34.860
to predict Negative again using
all of our other variables

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.030
as independent variables and
the data set trainSparse.

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.409
We'll again use the
default parameter settings.

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:47.940
The random forest model
takes significantly longer

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.940
to build than the CART model.

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.490
We've seen this before when
building CART and random forest

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.710
models, but in this
case, the difference

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:56.800
is particularly drastic.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.680
This is because we have so
many independent variables,

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.350
about 300 different words.

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:04.970
So far in this course,
we haven't seen data sets

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:07.590
with this many
independent variables.

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.680
So keep in mind that for
text analytics problems,

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.760
building a random forest model
will take significantly longer

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.980
than building a CART model.

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:17.750
So now that our
model's finished,

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.330
let's make predictions
on our test set.

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.430
We'll call them predictRF,
and again, we'll

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:27.570
use the predict function
to make predictions

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:31.920
using the model
tweetRF this time,

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.090
and again, the new
data set testSparse.

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.950
Now let's make our confusion
matrix using the table

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:44.790
function, first giving
the actual outcomes,

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:50.530
testSparse$Negative, and
then giving our predictions,

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:51.030
predictRF.

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:56.690
To compute the accuracy of
the random forest model,

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:02.280
we again sum up the cases
we got right, 293 plus 21,

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.530
and divide by the total number
of observations in the table.

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:14.370
So our random forest model
has an accuracy of 0.885.

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:16.320
This is a little better
than our CART model,

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.930
but due to the interpretability
of our CART model,

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:22.310
I'd probably prefer it over
the random forest model.

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:25.090
If you were to use
cross-validation to pick the cp

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:27.770
parameter for the CART
model, the accuracy

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:31.820
would increase to about the
same as the random forest model.

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:35.280
So by using a bag-of-words
approach and these models,

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.909
we can reasonably
predict sentiment even

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:41.490
with a relatively small
data set of tweets.
