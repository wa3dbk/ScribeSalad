00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.410
In this lecture, we'll be
discussing the story of Netflix

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.630
and how their
recommendation system is

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.520
worth a million dollars.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.870
Through this example,
we'll introduce

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.960
the method of clustering.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.980
Netflix is an online DVD rental
and streaming video service.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.610
Customers can receive
movie rentals by mail,

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.910
and they can also watch selected
movies and TV shows online.

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.200
Netflix has more than 40
million subscribers worldwide

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.650
and has an annual
revenue of $3.6 billion.

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.340
A key aspect of the
company is being

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.580
able to offer customers accurate
movie recommendations based

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.980
on a customer's own preferences
and viewing history.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:02.490
From 2006 through 2009, Netflix
ran a contest asking the public

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:07.200
to submit algorithms to predict
user ratings for movies.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.760
This algorithm would
be useful for Netflix

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.110
when making
recommendations to users.

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.100
Netflix provided a training data
set of about 100 million user

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.650
ratings and a test data set
of about three million user

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.020
ratings.

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.610
They offered a grand
prize of $1 million

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.230
to the team who could beat
Netflix's current algorithm,

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.800
called Cinematch,
by more than 10%

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.090
measured in terms of
root mean squared error.

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.910
Netflix believed that
their recommendation system

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.950
was so valuable that it
was worth a million dollars

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.350
to improve.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.479
The contest had a few rules.

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.170
One with that if the grand
prize was not yet reached,

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.539
progress prizes of
$50,000 per year

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:57.550
would be awarded
for the best results

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.570
so far, as long as it was
at least a 1% improvement

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.740
over the previous year.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.050
Another rule was that
teams must submit

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.770
their code and a
description of the algorithm

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.320
to be awarded any prizes.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.620
And lastly, if a team met
the 10% improvement goal,

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.130
a last call would be
issued, and 30 days

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.380
would remain for all teams to
submit their best algorithm.

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.220
So what happened?

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.770
The contest went live
on October 2, 2006.

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.660
By October 8, only
six days later, a team

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.850
submitted an algorithm
that beat Cinematch.

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.690
A week later, on
October 15, there

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.950
were three teams
already submitting

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.150
algorithms beating Cinematch.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.320
One of these solutions beat
Cinematch by more than 1%,

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.740
already qualifying
for a progress prize.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.380
The contest was hugely
popular all over the world.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.020
By June, 2007, over
20,000 teams had

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.320
registered from
over 150 countries.

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.540
The 2007 progress prize went
to a team called BellKor,

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.530
with an 8.43% improvement
over Cinematch.

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.980
The following year, several
teams from across the world

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.410
joined forces to improve
the accuracy even further.

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.579
In 2008, the progress prize
again went to team BellKor.

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:26.079
But this time, the
team included members

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:28.600
from the team
BigChaos in addition

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.500
to the original
members of BellKor.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.620
This was the last progress prize
because another 1% improvement

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.070
would reach the grand
prize goal of 10%.

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:45.840
On June 26, 2009, the team
BellKor's Pragmatic Chaos,

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.160
composed of members from three
different original teams,

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.540
submitted a 10.05%
improvement over Cinematch,

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.920
signaling the last
call for the contest.

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.270
Other teams had 30 days
to submit algorithms

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:02.510
before the contest closed.

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.020
These 30 days were filled with
intense competition and even

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:07.470
more progress.

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.870
But before revealing
what happened,

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.670
let's investigate how we could
try to predict user ratings.

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.550
In the next video, we'll discuss
how recommendation systems

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:19.570
generally work.
