00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:07.360
In the previous video, we
used linear optimization

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:08.910
to allocate ads.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.040
In this video, we're going
to use a greedy approach

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.990
to allocate ads to queries.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.370
The approach is called greedy
because we allocate the ads

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:17.730
sequentially and
we prioritize which

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.520
combinations of ad
and query to use,

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.570
based on the average
price per display.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.070
So here we have a
spreadsheet set up

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.360
in the same way as the one
from the previous video

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.360
with some minor tweaks.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.830
If we scroll down, we
have this table here,

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.720
which has cells corresponding
to combinations of advertisers

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.270
and queries, which tells us
basically how many times we

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.150
display a particular
advertiser's

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.550
ad with a particular query.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.890
But to the side here,
we have another table

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.750
which we will use to
keep track at every stage

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.430
of our allocation process,
how much we can allocate--

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.940
how many displays we can
perform of a particular ad

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.000
with a particular query,
based on the budget,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.280
and based on how many
displays of each query

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.770
remain unallocated.

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.150
Further down, where we
have our constraints,

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.140
we've added some new
cells here, which

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.810
are labeled with the
word "Remaining,"

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.530
to indicate how much of the
budgets of each advertiser

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.560
remaining, and how many
displays of each query

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.800
remain unallocated.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.940
So let's get started with
our greedy allocation.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.190
So to start, we go up to our
Average Price Per Display

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.760
table, and we find
the combination

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.720
of advertiser and
query which gives us

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.240
the largest average
price per display.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.920
So, in this case, the largest
average price per display

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.009
is five.

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:41.560
And this happens when we display
Verizon's ad with Query 3.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.229
So this is the first
variable that we're

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.820
going to change in
our greedy allocation.

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.789
These are the first,
basically the first displays

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:50.340
that we're going to use.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:57.020
So if we scroll down, we
add Verizon in Query 3.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.720
And to figure out
the budget limit,

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.070
we go to Verizon's remaining
budget which is $160.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:08.479
And so we take that
$160, and we divide it

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.250
through by the average
price per display of $5.

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.190
So, we get this number
32, and so what this means

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.960
is that we can display
Verizon's ad with Query 3,

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.940
32 times based solely on the
remaining budget of Verizon.

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.329
Now, of course, we also have
to respect how many displays

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:27.840
are unallocated of each
query, and for query 3,

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.370
we have 80 displays.

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.960
So the query limit
at this stage is 80.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.780
So now how many
times do we actually

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.020
display Verizon's
ad with Query 3?

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.140
Well, the most that we can
display Verizon's ad with Query

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.220
3 is going to be the smaller
of these two numbers.

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.130
And so in this case the smaller
of the two numbers is 32.

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:52.790
So, we allocate Verizon's
ad to Query 3, 32 times.

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.640
So now after we've changed
the value of this variable,

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.600
you can see that the budget
of Verizon has changed.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.630
So now it is 0.

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.230
So we've completely
extinguished Verizon's budget,

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.500
and the remaining unallocated
displays for Query 3

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:08.650
has also changed.

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.550
So this number used to
be 80 and now it is 48.

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.720
So, since we've extinguished
Verizon's budget,

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.340
we go back up to our Average
Price Per Display table.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.910
And so now we have to
select a new combination

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.660
to use in our allocation.

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.470
Since we've used up
Verizon's budget,

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.490
we're going to highlight these
cells corresponding to Verizon.

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:33.380
We're going to
highlight them in red

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.130
to indicate that we can't
use any of those combinations

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.900
anymore.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.660
And from the remaining
cells in the table,

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.540
we want to find the combination
of Advertiser and Query

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.740
that gives us the largest
average price per display.

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:48.829
So in this case,
the next highest

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:51.480
is for T-Mobile and
Query 3, and in this case

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.350
the average price
per display is two.

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.270
So this is the next
combination that we'll

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:57.280
use in our allocation.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.340
So if we scroll down, we
add T-Mobile and Query 3.

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.470
So now we have to
calculate the budget limit.

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.330
T-Mobile's remaining
budget is $100.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:12.790
We take $100, and we divide
it through by $2 per display,

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.440
and we get this value of 50.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.390
And the query limit for
T-Mobile and query 3

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.510
is the remaining number
of displays for Query 3,

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:22.800
which is 48.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.330
So we scroll up and we add 48.

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.540
And so now, how many
times do we actually

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.780
display T-Mobile's
ad with Query 3?

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.690
Well, that number
is 48, because 48

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:34.750
is the smaller of
the two numbers.

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.110
So we go ahead and we add that.

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:39.900
And so now T-Mobile's
budget has changed.

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.320
So it's dropped
from 100 to four,

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.320
and the remaining
displays of Query 3,

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.390
that number has dropped to 0.

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:49.090
So there are no more
displays of Query 3

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.180
remaining that we can use.

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.430
So now we move on to the
next stage of our allocation,

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.610
and we go back to the Average
Price Per Display table.

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.180
And since we've used up all
of the displays of Query 3,

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.930
we're going to highlight the
remaining cells corresponding

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.660
to Query 3 in red,
just to remind us

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:07.990
that we can't use them.

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:09.660
And so now from the
remaining cells,

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.310
again, we want to find
the highest average price

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:14.630
per display combination.

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.250
And so from the remaining
cells, the highest average price

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:22.060
per display occurs when we use
T-Mobile's ad with Query 1.

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.630
So that's the next variable that
we'll use in our allocation.

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:31.740
So we scroll back down and
we add T-Mobile with Query 1.

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.120
To compute the budget limit,
we take T-Mobile's remaining

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.980
budget which is four,
$4, and we divide it

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:40.450
through by the average
price per display of $1.

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:44.000
So, we get four displays
according to the budget.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.640
And the query
limit, in this case,

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:49.620
is 140, because there are
140 displays of Query 1

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:53.680
that haven't been
used towards any ad.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.060
Now how many times
do we actually

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.170
display T-Mobile's with Query 1?

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:59.980
Again, we just take the minimum
of these two quantities, which

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:01.200
is four.

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.090
We go ahead and we enter
that into our table.

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:06.310
So now if you look
at the budgets,

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:09.140
we've completely extinguished
T-Mobile's budget

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:12.560
and the remaining number
of displays of Query 1

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:17.610
that haven't been allocated
has dropped to 136.

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:21.830
So now we move on to the
next stage of our allocation.

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:23.840
Again, we've eliminated
T-Mobile's budget.

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:29.130
So now we highlight
those cells in red.

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:31.340
And so now, we want to pick
the highest average price

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.090
per display from
the remaining cells.

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:35.640
Now in this case, the only two
combinations that remain to us

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.620
are to display AT&amp;T's
ad with Query 1

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:41.080
and to display AT&amp;T's
ad with Query 2.

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.380
Both of these have the same
average price per display,

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:46.270
so it doesn't matter which
one we really choose.

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:48.680
But for the purpose
of this solution,

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.870
let's just go with AT&amp;T
displayed with Query 1.

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:55.850
So the average price
per display is 0.5.

00:06:55.850 --> 00:07:00.420
So we go down, we add that
entry to our side table here.

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:01.880
And to compute the
budget limit, we

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:07.070
take AT&amp;T's remaining
budget of 170,

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:10.040
and we divide it through by 0.5.

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:11.920
To get the query
limit, we just look

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:15.400
at the number of remaining
displays of Query 1,

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.620
which is 136.

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:19.410
So we add that.

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:22.170
And so now, obviously, the
smaller of the two quantities

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:23.670
is 136.

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:29.430
So we'll display AT&amp;T's ad
with Query 1, 136 times.

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:32.890
So now if we look at the
state of our allocation,

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:37.100
we've basically used up all
the displays of Query 1.

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:40.110
And we've used up some
part of AT&amp;T's budget,

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:42.320
though there's still a lot left.

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:46.060
So now we go back up
and we now proceed

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:51.000
to make the next allocation
in our greedy solution.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.060
We've eliminated
AT&amp;T in Query 1.

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:58.370
So now the only combination that
remains is AT&amp;T with Query 2.

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:00.660
So we go down.

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:03.560
We add that entry
to our side table.

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.380
And so now to get
the budget limit,

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:11.150
we take AT&amp;T's remaining
budget of $102,

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:14.130
and we divide it
through by 0.5, which

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:18.050
is the average price
per display to get 204.

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:21.760
And the query limit
now is 80, because 80

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:27.380
is the number of remaining
unassigned displays of Query 2.

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:29.960
And now the smaller of
the two numbers is 80.

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:33.440
And so we add 80 to our table.

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.970
And so at this point, we've
gone through all the entries

00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:37.600
in our average price
per display table,

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:41.360
and we've eliminated
basically all of them.

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.210
And in terms of
the allocation, we

00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:46.130
know that we can't make any more
allocations, because if we look

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:50.560
at our constraints, basically,
there are no more displays

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:53.690
of any query that have not been
assigned to any advertiser.

00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:56.250
So all of these
entries here are 0.

00:08:56.250 --> 00:09:00.430
And in this case, AT&amp;T's budget
is still some positive value.

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:05.150
So we still have $62 of
ATamp;T's budget remaining.

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:08.240
But since we don't have any
more displays of any query

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:10.760
that we can use, we
are basically done.

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:13.260
So this is our greedy solution.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.610
And so there are a couple
of interesting things

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:18.140
to note about this
greedy solution.

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:21.570
So the first is that the
actual combinations that

00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:23.030
are used by the
greedy solution are

00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:25.400
different from
those that are made

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:27.810
by the linear optimization
based solution.

00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:30.680
So for example, in the
optimization solution,

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:34.330
if you recall, we only
used Query 3 with AT&amp;T.

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:38.270
So we only displayed-- whenever
we displayed an ad with Query

00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:40.490
3, it was only ATamp;T's ad.

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:43.440
But in this case,
we don't actually

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:46.330
display AT&amp;T's ad
with Query 3 ever.

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:50.550
And in fact, we display only
T-Mobile's ad and Verizon's ad

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:51.620
with Query 3.

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:55.510
We don't use AT&amp;T. So that's--
so the actual allocation

00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:59.410
changes and so as a result,
the revenue that we get from

00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:02.970
the greedy solution is different
from the revenue that we get

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:04.730
from the optimization solution.

00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:08.360
If you recall, the revenue
from the optimization solution

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.640
was $428.

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:13.360
Now, this may not seem like
a very large difference.

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.340
So this is a difference of $60.

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:21.210
But in relative terms, this is
actually a rather large amount,

00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:30.030
368 relative to 428
is roughly 14 percent.

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:34.090
And so, hopefully this
illustrates the fact

00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:35.690
that an optimization
based solution

00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:39.530
can provide a significant
difference in performance

00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:43.070
relative to a basic
common sense solution.

00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:45.600
So this concludes our
construction and our discussion

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:47.620
of the greedy solution.

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:51.200
In the next video, we will go
back to our linear optimization

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:55.400
model, and we will consider
some of the sensitivity analysis

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:57.530
that goes along with that model.
