00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:05.320
Hello.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.690
This week we'll
discuss how analytics

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:10.100
can be used to make
recommendations

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.020
for movies and for health.

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:14.190
In the first lecture,
we discuss how

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.130
Netflix offered the
million dollar prize

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.700
to improve their movie
recommendation system.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.620
In the second lecture, we
discuss how health care claims

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.210
data can be used to predict the
occurrence of a heart attack

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.040
and to better
understand patterns.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.360
Through these examples,
we'll discuss the method

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.550
of plastering, which is
used to find similarities

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.020
and patterns in data.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.000
Let's get started.
