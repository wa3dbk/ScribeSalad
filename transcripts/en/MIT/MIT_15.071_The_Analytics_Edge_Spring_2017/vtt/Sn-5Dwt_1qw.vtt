00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.750
Hello, this is Dimitris.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.830
This week, our lectures focus
on applications of analytics

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.620
into interesting areas.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.950
In the first lecture,
we'll describe

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.060
how a Princeton professor
used linear regression

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.190
to predict the quality of wine.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:22.960
In the second lecture,
we'll discuss the story

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.140
of Moneyball, and how
data and analytics was

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.060
used to create a
championship team.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:30.930
Through these examples,
we will teach you

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.790
the method of linear regression.

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.750
In both lectures, we'll use
data to replicate the models in

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.010
R, and so how simple analytics
can create a significant edge.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.010
Let's get started.
