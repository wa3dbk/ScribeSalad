00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.120
So now let's build an equation
to predict points scored

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.270
using some common
basketball statistics.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:14.990
So our dependent variable
would now be points,

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:16.450
and our independent
variables would

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:18.380
be some of the common
basketball statistics

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.440
that we have in our data set.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.990
So for example, the number of
two-point field goal attempts,

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.670
the number of three-point
field goal attempts,

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.790
offensive rebounds,
defensive rebounds,

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:33.680
assists, steals,
blocks, turnovers,

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.520
free throw attempts--
we can use all of these.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.750
So let's build this regression
and call it PointsReg.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:53.940
And that will just be equal
to lm of PTS regressing

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.170
on all those variables
we just talked about.

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:04.080
So X2PA for two-point
attempts, plus X3PA

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:12.300
for three-point attempts, plus
FTA for free throw attempts,

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:19.280
AST for assists, ORB
offensive rebounds,

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:26.640
DRB for defensive rebounds,
TOV for turnovers,

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.270
and STL for steals.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.700
And let's also throw
in blocks, BLK.

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.770
Okay.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.120
And as always, the data
is from the NBA data set.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.450
So we can go ahead
and run this command.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.650
So now that we've created
our points regression model,

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:53.990
let's take a look
at the summary.

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.860
This is always the first
thing you should do.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.460
Okay, so taking a
look at this, we

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.770
can see that some of our
variables are indeed very,

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.570
very, significant.

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.250
Others are less significant.

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.740
For example, steals only
has one significance star.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.360
And some don't seem to
be significant at all.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.780
For example, defensive
rebounds, turnovers, and blocks.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.480
We do have a pretty good
R-squared value, 0.8992,

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.750
so it shows that there really
is a linear relationship

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.700
between points and all of
these basketball statistics.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.579
Let's compute the
residuals here.

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:35.490
We can just do that by
directly calling them,

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:36.740
so that's PointsReg$residuals.

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:48.829
So there's this
giant list of them,

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:52.750
and we'll use this to compute
the sum of squared errors.

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.480
SSE, standing for sum
of squared errors,

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.900
is just equal to the
sum(PointsReg$residuals^2).

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.090
So what is the sum of
squared errors here?

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:23.220
It's quite a lot-- 28,394,314.

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.040
So the sum of
squared errors number

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.470
is not really a very
interpretable quantity.

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:29.930
But remember, we
can also calculate

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.980
the root mean
squared error, which

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.040
is much more interpretable.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.720
It's more like the average error
we make in our predictions.

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.850
So the root mean squared error,
RMSE-- let's calculate it here.

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:49.140
So RMSE is just equal
to the square root

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.660
of the sum of squared
errors divided by n,

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.640
where n here is the number
of rows in our data set.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:12.750
So the RMSE in
our case is 184.4.

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:18.029
So on average, we make an
error of about 184.4 points.

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:20.570
That seems like quite a
lot, until you remember that

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.470
the average number of points
in a season is, let's see,

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:25.060
mean(NBA$PTS).

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.570
This will give us the average
number of points in a season,

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:39.700
and it's 8,370.

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:44.930
So, okay, if we have an average
number of points of 8,370,

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:51.300
being off by about 184.4
points is really not so bad.

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.820
But I think we still have room
for improvement in this model.

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.130
If you recall, not all the
variables were significant.

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:00.830
Let's see if we can remove some
of the insignificant variables

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:02.870
one at a time.

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.330
We'll take a look
again at our model,

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:12.120
summary(PointsReg),
in order to figure out

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.720
which variable we
should remove first.

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:18.270
The first variable we
would want to remove

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.730
is probably turnovers.

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:22.910
And why do I say turnovers?

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:25.950
It's because the p value for
turnovers, which you see here

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:34.200
in this column, 0.6859, is the
highest of all of the p values.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.940
So that means that turnovers
is the least statistically

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:40.860
significant variable
in our model.

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.760
So let's create a new regression
model without turnovers.

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.940
An easy way to do this
is just to use your up

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:49.990
arrow on your
keyboard, and scroll up

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:52.480
through all of your
previous commands

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:55.100
until you find the command
where you defined the regression

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:55.600
model.

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.230
Okay, so this is the command
where we defined the model.

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:14.460
Now let's delete turnovers, and
then we can rename the model,

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:16.130
and we'll call this
one just PointsReg2.

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:26.180
So in our first regression
model, PointsReg,

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.060
we had an R-squared of 0.8992.

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:31.110
Let's take a look at the
R-squared of PointsReg2.

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:43.610
And we see that it's 0.8991.

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:45.990
So almost exactly identical.

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:48.659
It does go down, as we
would expect, but very, very

00:06:48.659 --> 00:06:49.930
slightly.

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:53.200
So it seems that we're
justified in removing turnovers.

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:54.790
Let's see if we can
remove another one

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:57.490
of the insignificant variables.

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:00.280
The next one, based on p-value,
that we would want to remove

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.700
is defensive rebounds.

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:04.550
So again, let's
create our model,

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:08.700
taking out defensive rebounds,
and calling this PointsReg3.

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:11.710
We'll just scroll up again.

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:15.710
Take out DRB, for
defensive rebounds,

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:18.070
and change the name
of this to PointsReg3

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:19.760
so we don't
overwrite PointsReg2.

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:25.360
Let's look at the
summary again to see

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:26.700
if the R-squared has changed.

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:35.430
And it's the same, it's 0.8991.

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:39.659
So I think we're justified again
in removing defensive rebounds.

00:07:39.659 --> 00:07:43.070
Let's try this one more time
and see if we can remove blocks.

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:45.380
So we'll remove blocks,
and call it PointsReg4.

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:56.960
Take a look at the
summary of PointsReg4.

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:06.140
And again, the R-squared
value stayed the same.

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:09.590
So now we've gotten down to a
model which is a bit simpler.

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:11.580
All the variables
are significant.

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:15.670
We've still got an
R-squared 0.899.

00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:18.140
And let's take a look now
at the sum of squared errors

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:20.070
and the root mean
square error, just

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:21.720
to make sure we
didn't inflate those

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:23.520
too much by removing
a few variables.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.130
So, remember that the sum
of squared errors that we

00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:35.409
had in the original model was
this giant number, 28,394,314.

00:08:35.409 --> 00:08:38.020
And the root mean squared error,
the much more interpretable

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:40.850
number, was 184.4.

00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:43.370
So those are the numbers we'll
be comparing against when

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:46.170
we calculate the new
sum of squared errors

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:49.410
of the new model, PointsReg4.

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:51.380
So let's call this SSE_4.

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:58.210
And that will just be equal to
sum(PointsReg4$residuals^2).

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:18.090
And then RMSE_4 will just be
the square root of SSE_4 divided

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:21.270
by n, the number of
rows in our data set.

00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:28.310
Okay, so let's take
a look at these.

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:41.780
The new sum of squared
errors is now 28,421,465.

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:44.160
Again, I find this very
difficult to interpret.

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.990
I like to look at the root
mean squared error instead.

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:53.180
So the root mean squared
error here is just RMSE_4,

00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:57.580
and so it's 184.5.

00:09:57.580 --> 00:09:59.880
So although we've increased
the root mean squared error

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:01.960
a little bit by removing
those variables,

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:04.380
it's really a very,
very, small amount.

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:08.170
Essentially, we've kept the root
mean squared error the same.

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:10.780
So it seems like we've narrowed
down on a much better model

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:12.860
because it's simpler,
it's more interpretable,

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:16.120
and it's got just about
the same amount of error.
