00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.210
This is a lecture of how IBM
built a computer that plays

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.100
the very popular
game of Jeopardy!.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:23.160
In 2004, IBM Vice President
Charles Lickel and coworkers

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.890
were having dinner
at a restaurant.

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.160
All of a sudden, the
restaurant fell silent.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.770
Everyone was watching
the game Jeopardy!

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.210
on the television.

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.040
A contestant, Ken Jennings,
was setting the record

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.690
for the longest winning
streak of all time, 75 days.

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.920
Why was everyone so interested?

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:42.420
Jeopardy!

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.080
is a quiz show that asks complex
and clever questions like puns,

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.940
obscure facts, and
uncommon words.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.380
It originally aired in 1964.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.330
It covers a huge
variety of topics,

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.630
and it's generally viewed
as an impressive feat

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.600
to do well in this game.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.040
No computer system has ever been
developed that could even come

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.630
close to competing with
humans on Jeopardy!.

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.370
IBM Research strives to
push the limits of science.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.560
It has a tradition of addressing
inspiring and difficult

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.640
challenges over the years.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.300
In the mid '90s, it built
Deep Blue, a computer,

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.060
to compete against the
best human chess players,

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.530
and then in the
mid '90s, Deep Blue

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.530
beat Garry Kasparov,
who was at that time

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.260
the world champion in chess.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.650
Later it built Blue
Gene, a computer

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.740
to map the human genome.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.310
In 2005, a team at
IBM Research started

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.680
creating a computer that
would compete at Jeopardy!

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.870
Of course, no one knew at
the time how to beat humans

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.610
or if it was even possible.

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.610
Six years later, a
two-game exhibition match

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.039
aired on television.

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:01.390
The winner would receive
a million dollars.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:09.030
The contestants were Ken
Jennings, the longest winning

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.550
champion, whose longest
winning streak was 75 days;

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.940
Brad Rutter, who was the
biggest money winner of over 3.5

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.850
million; and Watson, a
supercomputer with 3,000

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.000
processors and a database of 200
million pages of information.

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.720
This is Jeopardy!--
The IBM Challenge.

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.110
And now, here is the host
of Jeopardy!, Alex Trebek.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.560
Thank you, Johnny Gilbert.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.540
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.280
And welcome, everyone, to a
very special Jeopardy! event.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.010
For the next three
days, we're going

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.430
to be coming to you from this
IBM Research facility just

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.490
outside of New York City.

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.210
And let me tell you why.

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.590
A little over three years
ago, the folks at IBM

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.320
came to us with a proposal
that they considered

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.550
to be the next grand
challenge in computing.

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.280
And that was designing
a computer system

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.120
that could understand
the complexities

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.700
of natural language
well enough to compete

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.240
against Jeopardy!'s
best players.

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.760
Well, they think
they've succeeded,

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.270
and that's why we're here today.

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:23.340
So you are about to witness
what may prove to be an historic

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.200
competition -- an exhibition
match pitting an IBM computer

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.710
system against the two most
celebrated and successful

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:33.050
players in Jeopardy! history.

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:34.620
Sounds like a lot
of fun, doesn't it?

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.570
Developed and programmed
especially for this moment,

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.840
making its first appearance
on our national television

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.740
program, ladies and
gentlemen, this is Watson.

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:52.510
Just as I expected, that
was a very warm reception.

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.470
And I'm sure Watson
would've appreciated

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.910
the applause, except
for one thing.

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.340
Watson can neither hear nor see.

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.360
It will be receiving all of
its information electronically.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.120
And as a matter of fact, what
you're looking at right now

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.670
is not the real Watson.

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.790
This is an avatar.

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.400
This is a representation
of Watson.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.769
Watson, of course, is a
sophisticated computer system

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:21.740
too big and too heavy to
fit behind that lectern

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:23.520
on our stage.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.070
But it is close by.

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:26.510
It's right next door.

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.260
And a little while
ago, I paid it a visit.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:31.920
The very first thing
you will notice

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.470
as I come into Watson's
space is noise.

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:38.600
There is a lot of noise.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.370
A little bit comes from Watson
himself, but most of the noise

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.030
comes from two very
large refrigerator

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.980
units that help to
keep Watson cool.

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:53.310
Now as you can see, Watson
has been set up in two units.

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:57.220
Each half contains
five separate racks.

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:05.190
Each of these racks contains
10 IBM Power 750 servers.

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:06.840
Now when you link
all of these servers

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.770
together, as they
have done for Watson,

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:13.090
you create a deep
analytic system

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:18.100
that is the equivalent of
2,800 powerful computers tied

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.860
together in a super
high speed network.
