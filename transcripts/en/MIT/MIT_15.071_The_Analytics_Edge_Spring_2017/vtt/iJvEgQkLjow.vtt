00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.720
In this video, we'll
build a CART model

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.010
to predict healthcare cost.

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:14.040
First, let's make sure the
packages rpart and rpart.plot

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.340
are loaded with the
library function.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.370
You should have
already installed them

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:24.380
in the previous lecture on
predicting Supreme Court

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.880
decisions.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.240
Now, let's build our CART model.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.200
We'll call it ClaimsTree.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:41.580
And we'll use the rpart
function to predict bucket2009,

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:54.550
using as independent variables:
age, arthritis, alzheimers,

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:13.920
cancer, copd, depression,
diabetes, heart.failure, ihd,

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:23.650
kidney, osteoporosis,
and stroke.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:33.690
We'll also use bucket2008
and reimbursement2008.

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.920
The data set we'll use to
build our model is ClaimsTrain.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:49.400
And then we'll add the
arguments, method = "class",

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:59.370
since we have a classification
problem here, and cp = 0.00005.

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.380
Note that even though we have
a multi-class classification

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.270
problem here, we build
our tree in the same way

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.009
as a binary
classification problem.

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.320
So go ahead and hit Enter.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.490
The cp value we're
using here was

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.500
selected through
cross-validation

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.440
on the training set.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.170
We won't perform the
cross-validation here,

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.020
because it takes a
significant amount of time

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.730
on a data set of this size.

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:33.390
Remember that we have
almost 275,000 observations

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.510
in our training set.

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.760
But keep in mind
that the R commands

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.070
needed for cross-validation
here are the same as those used

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.870
in the previous lecture on
predicting Supreme Court

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.780
decisions.

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.850
So now that our
model's done, let's

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.860
take a look at our tree
with the prp function.

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.670
It might take a while
to load, because we

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.930
have a huge tree here.

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.730
This makes sense
for a few reasons.

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.740
One is the large number of
observations in our training

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:08.980
set.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.970
Another is that we have a
five-class classification

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.340
problem, so the
classification is

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.840
more complex than a binary
classification case,

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.680
like the one we saw in
the previous lecture.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.530
The trees used by D2Hawkeye
were also very large CART trees.

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.290
While this hurts the
interpretability of the model,

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.850
it's still possible to describe
each of the buckets of the tree

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.260
according to the splits.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.780
So now, let's make
predictions on the test set.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:45.079
So go back to your R console,
and we'll call our predictions

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:52.440
PredictTest, where we'll use the
predict function for our model

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:57.860
ClaimsTree, and our
newdata is ClaimsTest.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.310
And we want to
add type = "class"

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:06.750
to get class predictions.

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.490
And we can make our
classification matrix

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:14.360
on the test set to
compute the accuracy.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.620
So we'll use the table function,
where the actual outcomes are

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:25.810
ClaimsTest$bucket2009, and our
predictions are PredictTest.

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.060
So to compute the
accuracy, we need

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.350
to add up the numbers
on the diagonal

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.600
and divide by the total number
of observations in our test

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:37.790
set.

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:54.409
So we have 114141 +
16102 + 118 + 201 + 0.

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:58.360
And we'll divide by the
number of rows in ClaimsTest.

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:06.430
So the accuracy of
our model is 0.713.

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:09.420
For the penalty error, we
can use our penalty matrix

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.670
like we did in the
previous video.

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:15.440
So scroll up to the
classification matrix command

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:22.560
and surround the table function
by the as.matrix function,

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.370
and then we'll multiply
by PenaltyMatrix.

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:34.010
So remember that this takes
each entry in our classification

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:37.770
matrix and multiplies it
by the corresponding number

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:40.310
in the penalty matrix.

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:42.190
So now we just
need to add up all

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:47.800
of the numbers in this matrix
by surrounding it by the sum

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.840
function and then dividing
by the total number

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.930
of observations in our test
set, or nrow(ClaimsTest).

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:03.570
So our penalty error is 0.758.

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:06.400
In the previous video, we
saw that our baseline method

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:12.330
had an accuracy of 68% and
a penalty error of 0.74.

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.510
So while we increased
the accuracy,

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:16.770
the penalty error also went up.

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:18.100
Why?

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:22.870
By default, rpart will try to
maximize the overall accuracy,

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:27.180
and every type of error is seen
as having a penalty of one.

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:31.360
Our CART model predicts
3, 4, and 5 so rarely

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:35.450
because there are very few
observations in these classes.

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:37.530
So we don't really
expect this model

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:41.530
to do better on the penalty
error than the baseline method.

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:43.640
So how can we fix this?

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:46.250
The rpart function
allows us to specify

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:48.500
a parameter called loss.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:50.330
This is the penalty
matrix we want

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:52.650
to use when building our model.

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:56.930
So let's scroll back up to
where we built our CART model.

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:59.140
At the end of the
rpart function,

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:03.800
we'll add the argument params
= list(loss=PenaltyMatrix).

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:16.470
This is the name of the
penalty matrix we created.

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:21.150
Close the parentheses
and hit Enter.

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:23.960
So while our model
is being built,

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:27.270
let's think about what
we expect to happen.

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:30.000
If the rpart function
knows that we'll

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.070
be giving a higher penalty
to some types of errors

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:36.490
over others, it might
choose different splits

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:38.780
when building the
model to minimize

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:41.270
the worst types of errors.

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:44.159
We'll probably get a
lower overall accuracy

00:07:44.159 --> 00:07:45.850
with this new model.

00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:49.060
But hopefully, the penalty
error will be much lower too.

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:57.380
So now that our model is done,
let's regenerate our test

00:07:57.380 --> 00:08:02.090
set predictions by scrolling up
to where we created PredictTest

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:06.330
and hitting Enter, and then
recreating our classification

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:10.200
matrix by scrolling up
to the table function

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:13.910
and hitting Enter again.

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:23.250
Now let's add up the numbers
on the diagonal, 94310 + 18942

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:35.070
+ 4692 + 636 + 2, and
divide by the number of rows

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:35.830
in ClaimsTest.

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:40.390
And hit Enter.

00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:44.620
So the accuracy of
this model is 0.647.

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:49.080
And we can scroll up and
compute the penalty error here

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:53.570
by going back to the sum
command and hitting Enter.

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:57.890
So the penalty error of
our new model is 0.642.

00:08:57.890 --> 00:09:01.170
Our accuracy is now lower
than the baseline method,

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:04.700
but our penalty error
is also much lower.

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:08.060
Note that we have significantly
fewer independent variables

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:09.970
than D2Hawkeye had.

00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:12.830
If we had the hundreds
of codes and risk factors

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:17.230
available to D2Hawkeye, we
would hopefully do even better.

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:20.550
In the next video, we'll discuss
the accuracy of the models

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:25.720
used by D2Hawkeye and how
analytics can provide an edge.
