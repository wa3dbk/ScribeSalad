00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.900
This is our first lecture
on text analytics.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.870
We'll discuss how can
use data from Twitter

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:16.320
and turn them into knowledge.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.100
Twitter is a social
networking and communication

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.890
website founded in 2006.

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.000
Users share and
send messages that

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.130
can be no longer than
140 characters long.

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.350
It is indeed one of the
Top 10 most visited sites

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:34.190
on the internet.

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.210
It had an initial
public offering in 2013,

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:42.650
and it's current valuation
is about $31 billion.

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.290
Let's discuss the
impact of Twitter.

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.850
Protesters around the
world use Twitter.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.380
It had an important
impact on Arab Spring.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.420
People also use it as a
method of notification

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.360
for natural disasters and
for tracking diseases.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.750
Celebrities, politicians,
and companies

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.290
connect with fans and
customers using Twitter.

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.020
Everyone is watching.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.270
To illustrate this
last point, let

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.530
us discuss a tweet
that was supposed

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.060
to be from the Associated Press.

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.910
The Associated Press
is a major news agency

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.289
that distributes news stories
to other news agencies.

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:26.830
In April 2013, someone
tweeted this message

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.450
from the main AP
verified Twitter account.

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.370
It said that two explosions
in the White House and Barack

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:36.850
Obama is injured.

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.000
The S&amp;P 500 stock index
fell 1% in seconds,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.310
but the White House
rapidly clarified.

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:49.460
Many companies maintain
online presences.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.250
Managing public perception in
an age of instant communication

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.979
is essential.

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.560
Reacting to changing sentiment,
identifying offensive posts,

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.300
determining topics of
interest are indeed crucial.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.060
In this lecture,
we'll see how we

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.430
can use analytics to
address these questions.
