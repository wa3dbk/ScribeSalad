00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.130
In this lecture, we
introduce linear regression

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.470
a simple but very powerful
method to analyze data

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.840
and make predictions
and apply it

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.360
in a very unexpected
context-- predicting

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.670
the quality of wines.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.170
Bordeaux is a region in France
popular for producing wine.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.970
While this wine
has been produced

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.670
in much the same way
for hundreds of years,

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.650
there are differences
in price and quality

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.400
from year to year that are
sometimes very significant.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.250
Bordeaux wines are
widely believed

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.640
to taste better
when they are order,

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.250
so there's an incentive
to store young wines

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.300
until they are mature.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.280
The main problem is that
it is hard to determine

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.200
the quality of the wine when it
is so young just by tasting it,

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.990
since the taste will change so
significantly by the time it

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:06.360
will actually be consumed.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.010
This is why wine tasters
and experts are helpful.

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.230
They taste the wines
and then predict

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.690
which ones will be
the best wines later.

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.340
The question we'll
address in this lecture--

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.260
can analytics model
this process better

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:25.510
and make stronger predictions?

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.990
On March 4, 1990,
the New York Times

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.479
announced that Princeton
economics professor Orley

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:38.759
Ashenfelter can predict the
quality of Bordeaux wine

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.370
without tasting a single drop.

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.300
Ashenfelter's
predictions have nothing

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.450
to do with assessing
the aroma of the wine,

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.870
looking at the legs, or
declaring that the wine tastes

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.740
citrusy, oaky, or nutty.

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.890
They are the results of
a mathematical model.

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.850
Ashenfelter used a method
called linear regression.

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.970
The methods predicts an outcome
variable or dependent variable.

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.060
And in doing so, it
uses a set of what

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.420
is called independent variables.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.890
For the dependent
variable, Ashenfelter

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:25.240
chose a typical price in
1990-1991 for Bordeaux wine

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.340
in an auction.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.640
This approximates quality.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.480
As independent
variables, he used

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.620
age of the wine-- so the older
wines are more expensive--

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.120
and weather-related
information, specifically

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.200
the average growing season
temperature, the harvest

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.700
rain, and winter rain.

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.820
In these figures,
we depict the data

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.340
during the period
from 1952 to 1978.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.490
There are four
independent variables--

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:02.080
the age of the wine, the average
growing season temperature,

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.450
the harvest rain,
and winter rain.

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.810
And on the vertical axis,
you observe the logarithm

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.130
of the price, the
realization in an auction.

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.050
So these are the primitive
data that Ashenfelter used.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.640
So Ashenfelter believed
that his predictions

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.140
are more accurate than
those of the world's

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.850
most influential wine critic.

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.560
His name is Robert Parker.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.480
In response, Parker
called Ashenfelter

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.910
to be "an absolute total
sham," and he adds that,

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:51.030
"rather like a movie critic
who never goes to see the movie

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.150
but tells you how
good it is based

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.490
on the actors and the director."
