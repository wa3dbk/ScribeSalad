00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.820
Visualization is a crucial step
for initial data exploration.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.740
It helps us discern
relationships, patterns,

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.220
and outliers.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.300
This video will give
us a starting point

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.100
on how to make plots in R, but
more advanced and way cooler

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.570
visualization tips will be
given in Week 8 of this class.

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.430
Let us first create a
scatterplot with Protein

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.000
on the x-axis and
Fat on the y-axis.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.820
To do this we can use
the plot function in R

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.710
and give it as a first input the
Protein vector on the x-axis,

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.790
and as a second input the
TotalFat vector on the y-axis.

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.950
And now pressing Enter,
a new window pops up.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.670
If you are on a PC, the new
Windows is called R Graphics,

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.420
and if you are on a Mac
it is called Quartz.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.160
The plot has a very
interesting triangular shape.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.840
It looks like foods that
are higher in protein

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.660
are typically lower in
fat, and vice versa.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.970
Now, looking at the
aesthetics of the graph,

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.400
we realize that R
gives default names

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.020
for the x-axis and the y-axis
using the vector dollar

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.350
notation.

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.360
Now we can modify these labels
by adding more arguments

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.070
to the plot function.

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.310
To go back to the R
console, you can simply

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.600
switch windows using
the Control tab

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.620
if you are on a Windows machine.

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.850
On a Mac, the windows are
not overlaid by default,

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.030
so accessing the
console should be easy.

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.000
OK, now let's use the Up
arrow to go back to our plot

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.770
function, and add the
argument xlab = "Protein"

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.390
and that gives us the
label of the x-axis.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:46.509
Then ylab = "Fat" and this gives
us the label to the y-axis.

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:50.650
And let's add a title to the
plot using the argument main,

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:56.080
say the title is
"Protein vs Fat".

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.370
And let's change
the color to red.

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.390
And remember to
put quotation marks

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.230
around the values of
all these arguments.

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.240
And now pressing Enter and going
back to the graphics window,

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.979
we see that R made all the
modifications we requested.

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.050
Another way we can visualize our
data is by plotting histograms.

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.750
We can do this using the
histogram function in R,

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.140
but note that this
function now only takes

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.620
one variable as an input,
because the y-axis should

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.170
have the frequencies.

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.940
So let's go back to
our console and create

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.670
a histogram of
VitaminC, for instance.

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.310
So we're going to use the
hist function, or histogram.

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.980
And then the argument that it
takes is the VitaminC vector.

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.140
Let's label the
x-axis as "Vitamin C",

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.990
and this is given
to us in milligrams.

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.500
And give it a title,
say "Histogram

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.460
of Vitamin C Levels".

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:57.900
Hmm.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.830
Even though the maximum
vitamin C content

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.470
is 2000 milligrams,
most of our foods--

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.700
well, to be more precise,
more than 6,000 of them--

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.060
have less than 200
milligrams of vitamin C.

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.080
And the histogram lumps them
all together in one cell.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.310
Well, it would be nice if we
can zoom into this section

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.870
here and get a finer
understanding of the data.

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.650
To do this we need to limit
the x-axis to go from zero

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.380
to, say, 100 milligrams.

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.220
So let's go back to the
console, and then we're

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.300
going to add the argument
xlim to limit the x-axis.

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.370
And using the combine
function or the c function,

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.190
we're going to set
the first input

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.680
to be 0, which is the
lowest value that we want

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.810
to see on the x-axis, and the
second argument as being 100,

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.000
which is the highest value that
we want to see on the x-axis.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.610
And now pressing
Enter, and we can

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.810
see that R gives us 0
to 100 on the x-axis.

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.650
But we only see
this one big cell.

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.530
It seems that R only
zoomed into the area,

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.370
but it didn't break
that huge cell,

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.640
and this doesn't give us
any additional information.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.440
So we really need to break up
the cell into smaller pieces.

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.210
And say we want 100 cells,
and since the interval

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:19.070
goes from 0 to 100,
then we would expect R

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.560
to create divisions that are
one milligrams in length.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.440
So let's do this.

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.370
Let's go back to the
console, and then we're

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.790
going to add the
argument breaks = 100

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:32.570
and this sets the
number of cells

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.080
that we want to see to 100.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.600
So let's see.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:36.530
Oh.

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:40.790
We actually only see
five cells, and each cell

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:43.000
is 20 milligrams long.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.380
Well, what happened?

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.440
We were expecting 100 cells.

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.840
Well remember that the
histogram originally

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.600
went far beyond 100 milligrams.

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.950
The maximum was 2000 milligrams.

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:59.310
And now if we were to divide
the original interval from 0

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:04.880
to 2000 into 100 cells,
then 2000 divided by 100,

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.560
each cell would be
20 milligrams long.

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.880
And this is exactly what R did.

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.160
It actually divided all
of the spectrum of values

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.860
from 0 to 2000 into
100 cells, and not only

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.330
the spectrum from 0 to 100.

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.090
But we still want to divide
the interval 0 to 100

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:26.770
into 100 cells, each
of length 1 milligram.

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:28.440
And how can we do this?

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.330
Well, we simply need
to think in terms

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.590
of the original interval,
which was 0 to 2000.

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:36.700
And if we were to break
it into 2000 cells,

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:39.090
then each one will be
of length one milligram.

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:42.600
So now we know that
actually we needed

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.970
to set the breaks to 2000.

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:46.540
So let's do this.

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:50.290
And now we obtain our
refined histogram.

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:52.860
And we see new
information here come up.

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:57.010
Remember our initial conclusion
was that more than 6,000 foods

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:00.290
have less than 200
milligrams of vitamin C.

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:02.240
But now that we
refined our graph,

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.310
we obtained an additional
level of information.

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:07.980
Actually, more
than 5,000 of them

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:12.050
have less than one
milligram of vitamin C.

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:15.980
Now a third way we can visualize
the data is using box plots.

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:19.140
So let's go back to the
console and create a box plot

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:19.970
for sugar.

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:23.450
So the function we're going
to be using is simply boxplot,

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:26.170
and similarly to the
histogram function,

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:30.050
the boxplot function only takes
as an input a single vector.

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:33.740
And in this case it would
be the Sugar vector.

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:40.680
And let's create a title that
says "Boxplot of Sugar Levels".

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:43.500
And is it the
y-axis or the x-axis

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:46.820
that we have to label
it as the sugar level?

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:49.840
So if we're not so sure,
let's just plot it,

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.120
and, oh, this should
be the y-axis.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.840
So let's go back to
the console, and simply

00:06:54.840 --> 00:07:00.420
set the y label
to be "Sugar (g)".

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:05.100
And now we have our box
plot with the right labels.

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:06.680
What is it trying
to tell us here?

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:08.520
It looks a little bit strange.

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:11.290
Well, the average of
sugar across the data set

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:12.810
seems to be pretty low.

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:15.290
It's somewhere
around five grams.

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:19.140
But we have a lot of outliers
with extremely high values

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:20.370
of sugar.

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:24.440
There exist some foods that
have almost 100 grams of sugar

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.120
in 100 grams.

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:29.550
Well, candies are definitely
among these foods.

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:31.720
So we just reviewed
three ways in which

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:33.600
we can visualize our data.

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:36.840
In Week 8, we will see more
advanced visualization tools

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:39.250
to make more informative plots.

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:42.730
In our next video we will see
how we can construct and add

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:45.790
new variables to our data set.
