00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.350
This week, we'll be discussing
the power of visualizations

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:10.950
for understanding
worldwide trends

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.970
and for using analytics
to stop crime.

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:17.310
In the first lecture, we'll
use data from the World Health

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.120
Organization to
create visualizations

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.790
that help us understand
and communicate

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:24.410
global health trends.

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.070
In the second lecture, we'll
discuss predictive policing,

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.810
and how police departments
across the country

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.180
are using data and analytics
to improve decision making.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.980
Through these examples, we'll
create visualizations in R

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.560
that help us understand
our data and our models.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.530
Let's get started.
