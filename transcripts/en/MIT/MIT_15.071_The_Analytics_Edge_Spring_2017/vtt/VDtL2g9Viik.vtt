00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.160
Hello.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.170
This week we'll
discuss a new area

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.660
of analytics, optimization.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.230
In the first lecture, we'll
see how American Airlines used

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.239
revenue management to
offer discounted fares

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:18.440
and beat the competition.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.730
Through this
example, we teach you

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.150
how to solve optimization
problems with a spreadsheet

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:24.630
software.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.680
In the second
lecture, we'll discuss

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.050
how optimization is used
to design radiation therapy

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.310
treatments.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.350
Let's get started.
