00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.290
So now we're going to
try plotting a world

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:08.810
map with a new data
set that has the number

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:11.580
of international students
from each country.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.080
So first of all,
we're going to need

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.570
to use the ggmap package,
which you may need to install.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:21.410
And we're going to
load in the data

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:22.780
set, which is
called intlall.csv.

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:27.570
So read.csv(intlall.csv).

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:38.290
And I'm going to do
stringsAsFactors = FALSE.

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.790
OK?

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.500
Let's look at the first
few rows of intlall.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.210
So you see that each row
corresponds to a country.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.350
There's a citizenship
column that's

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.480
the country name, number
of undergraduates, number

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.210
of graduates, special
undergraduates and graduates,

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.630
exchange or visiting,
and a total column.

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.290
Now there's these NAs in here,
but they're not really NAs.

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.530
They're just 0's.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.990
So what we're
going to do is say,

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.539
all these NAs should be 0's.

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:27.160
So in intlall, all entries
that are NA, should be 0.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.960
And let's look at the
first few rows again.

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:33.320
OK.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.180
Much better.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.520
Right, so next step is
to load the world map.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.110
So let's call it world_map
= map_data("world").

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.050
We did something similar in the
lecture with the state data.

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.410
So let's look at the
structure of the world_map.

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:02.740
So the first two columns are
the longitude and latitude;

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.870
third column is
something called group --

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:07.680
that's actually a
group for each country,

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.310
using a different number
for each country; order,

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.250
we'll get to that later; region
is just the country name,

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.350
and subregion is sometimes used
for some countries to describe

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.900
islands and other
things like that.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.150
So we want to shove
the world_map data

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.400
frame and the intlall data
frame into one data frame,

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.840
so we can use it for ggplot.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:46.240
So let's say world_map is a
merge of world_map and intlall.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.020
Now, in world_map,
the country name

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.910
is just called region, as
you can see right here.

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.240
And in the intlall,
the country name

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.470
is actually called Citizenship.

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:05.430
OK.

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.300
So let's look at the
structure of world_map

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.820
just to make sure
it makes sense.

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.300
Looks good.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.360
OK.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.890
So to plot a map, we use
the geom_polygon geometry.

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.280
So start off ggplot(world_map,
aes(x = long, y = lat,

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.950
group = group)).

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.680
We want to use geom_polygon
as the geometry.

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.000
Countries will be
filled in in white,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.910
and their borders
will be in black.

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:00.960
And we'll use a
Mercator projection.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.880
There's a few other
options in there, as well.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:08.310
OK.

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.850
So that looks kind
of like a world map.

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.300
There's a few things
going on here.

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:14.720
So first of all,
all the countries

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.640
look like big black blobs.

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.010
What on earth is going
on, you might say.

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.330
Well, sometimes the merge
can reorder the data.

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.610
And it turns out that what the
world_map data frame really is

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.530
is actually a list of
latitude and longitude points

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.490
that define the border
of each country.

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.659
So if we accidentally
reorder our data frame

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:39.560
they no longer make any sense.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.050
And as it goes from
point to point,

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.210
the points might be on the
other side of the country

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:44.900
as it defines the polygon.

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.700
So, we have to reorder the
data in the correct order.

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:53.060
So this command is a little
bit complicated looking,

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.880
but when you break it
down, it's not so bad.

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:00.850
So, we take the world_map,
and we're going to reorder it.

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.670
So world_map, we're going
to reorder the rows.

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:07.490
We're going to order
the rows based on, first

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.370
of all, the group,
which is pretty much

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:17.690
equivalent to the country, and
then the order variable, which

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:21.710
is just the correct order
for the border points.

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:25.510
And we're going to take
all the columns, of course.

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:26.280
Done.

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:32.000
So if we go and try plotting
it again -- so ggplot--

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.190
I guess I should go up, up.

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:37.190
There we go, much easier.

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.909
Right, so now we
have the map, and it

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:41.960
looks far more reasonable.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.040
OK, next problem.

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.400
Some of the countries
are missing.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.150
Now of course,
the USA is missing

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.330
because MIT is in
the USA, so that

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:57.480
wouldn't be an international
student coming from the USA.

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:00.460
And some parts of Africa
are missing, presumably

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:02.960
because there are no
students at MIT right now

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.620
who are from those countries.

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:08.480
But you'll also notice
that Russia is missing,

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:13.350
and a lot of countries
near it, as well as China.

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:14.940
Which is definitely
not true because I

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:20.020
have many friends at MIT who
are from Russia and China.

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:24.010
So, what do we do about that?

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:26.620
The reason China is
missing is that it

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:29.890
has a different name
in the MIT data frame

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:31.720
than in the
world_map data frame.

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.880
So when we merged
them, it was dropped

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.210
from the data set because
it didn't match up.

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:44.110
So to see what it's called
in the MIT data frame,

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:45.460
let's just do a table.

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:49.760
There's a few ways to do
this, but this is pretty easy.

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.409
OK, so we get a list
of all the names.

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:56.500
If we scroll all
the way up, we'll

00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:00.720
see it says "China
(People's Republic Of)".

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:04.290
Now, in the
world_map data frame,

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:05.600
it's simply called "China".

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:13.720
So, what we can do is
change the MIT data frame.

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:24.710
So let's say the citizenship
column, the one row where

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:30.300
it equals "China
(People's Republic Of)"

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:36.180
should just be "China".

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:38.690
OK, let's check.

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:40.710
Do the table again.

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:42.730
Scroll all the way up.

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:47.970
There it is, China.

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:48.950
So we've fixed that.

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:55.230
So now the MIT data frame is
consistent with the world_map

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:56.870
data frame.

00:07:56.870 --> 00:08:00.270
So now we have to go
through the merge again.

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:06.960
So let's say
world_map is a merge

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:14.590
of a fresh copy of the
map_data, the intlall data

00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:15.870
frame with China fixed.

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:24.310
It's called region in
the world_map data,

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:31.490
and it's called Citizenship
in the MIT data.

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:35.950
Alright, now we need to
do the reordering again.

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:41.580
So press up a few
times until we find it.

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:42.130
There it was.

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:46.080
So there's the
reordering command.

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:46.580
OK.

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:48.200
And we should be
good to go, now.

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.140
So let's try plotting it.

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:55.900
So ggplot, the
world_map data frame.

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:59.840
The aesthetic, x is the
longitude, y is the latitude.

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:02.410
We need to group
countries together,

00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:06.690
so it doesn't all
crisscross over the map.

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:10.410
We're going to use
geom_polygon again.

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:12.250
This time though, let's
actually fill them

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:14.410
with a color that's
proportional to the total number

00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:15.950
of students.

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:17.960
We'll still outline
them in black, though.

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:23.340
And we'll use the
Mercator projection.

00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:31.190
Much better.

00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:32.890
So Russia is missing
for similar reasons,

00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:35.270
but we won't deal with that
now because it's a little bit

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:35.910
annoying.

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:38.960
But you get the idea.

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:40.860
This is pretty
interesting actually.

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:47.650
So we can see that Canada,
and China, and India supply

00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:52.470
a large number of
international students to MIT.

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:54.830
But it is a little
bit confusing doing it

00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:57.900
on a per country basis,
because Europe, presumably,

00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:00.590
has quite a few students at MIT.

00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:03.150
But because Europe is made
up of many small countries,

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:05.410
it doesn't look very impressive.

00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:06.940
Maybe if all the
European countries

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:08.430
were grouped together,
it would look

00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:10.530
about the same color as Canada.

00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:13.740
But it's hard to tell.

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:15.800
There are also other
projections we can look at.

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:18.040
So this is a
Mercator projection.

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:20.920
What I want to show you is an
orthographic projection that

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:24.110
allows you to sort of view
the map in 3D, like a globe.

00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:27.150
So let's try that out.

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:33.500
ggplot, world_map,
aesthetics are the same.

00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:42.220
Actually, let me do
this the right way.

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:44.050
I'll just press up.

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:45.080
OK.

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:49.400
Let's change it to
orthographic projection.

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:53.010
And I want to find,
now, an orientation.

00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:55.850
And this is almost like thinking
about where in the world

00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:57.880
you want to focus on.

00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:01.310
So this is a latitude
and longitude, 20 degrees

00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:03.070
and 30 degrees.

00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:07.260
If we run this, we
should get a map

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:11.010
centered above North Africa.

00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:12.730
That's quite a
nice visualization

00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:16.030
because if you want to look
just at Africa and Europe,

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:17.690
this is the way to go.

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:19.580
We can still see China,
and Canada, and South

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:22.710
America in there, as well.

00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:24.840
Let's do something a
little bit more personal.

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:27.240
I want to change the
coordinates, now,

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:34.850
to -37 and 175.

00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:38.840
Now it's centered on my hometown
of Auckland, New Zealand.
