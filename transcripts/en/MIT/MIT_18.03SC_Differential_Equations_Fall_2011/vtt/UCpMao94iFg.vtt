00:00:05.688 --> 00:00:09.190
PROFESSOR: Welcome to this
recitation on linearization.

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:11.780
So here we consider a
prey-predator system,

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.650
where we have x dot equals
x, factorizing 3 minus x,

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.960
minus x*y, and y dot equals
y factorizing 1 minus y,

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.230
plus x*y.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.970
So here we can see that x is
the prey, because y is basically

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:27.060
feeding on it.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.420
And y is the predator,
because feeding

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.490
on x gives a growth of
the predator species, y.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:36.480
So here, because it's
a prey-predator system,

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.530
x and y are assumed
to be positive.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.310
So you're asked to interpret
even further this system

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:47.430
and to find the critical points,
linearize and sketch the phase

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.190
portrait and then discuss what
your linearization tells you

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.010
about the behavior
of this system.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.039
So why don't you pause
the video and take

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:55.080
a few minutes to do that.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.987
I'll be right back.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.260
Welcome back.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.310
So I helped you already
for the first question.

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:07.610
We interpreted that x was the
prey and y was the predator.

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.600
The other thing
that you could see

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.590
is that this term here is
basically logistic growth.

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.280
So if we didn't have the
predator species around,

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.100
this species x of
prey would just

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.780
grow and eventually reach
a value that corresponds

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.470
to the saturation level.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.670
And if we started with
a lot of prey, then

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.560
eventually they would
die off and go back

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.290
to that same carrying
capacity value

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.300
of prey in that environment.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.950
Same thing here
for the predator.

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.950
We have a logistic growth, with
different growth coefficients.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.740
And again, if we didn't
have the prey around,

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.800
we would just have
a logistic dynamic

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.940
for this species on its own.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.060
But with the prey, we have
a growth of this species.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.440
So that basically
ends the first part.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:59.667
For the second part, we need
to find the critical points.

00:01:59.667 --> 00:02:01.250
So how do we find
the critical points?

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.080
The critical points correspond
to basically f and g

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.090
equals to 0.

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.380
So f equal to 0 equals to g.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.790
You see from f equals to 0 that
we can have either x equals 0,

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.570
if we factorize the
x in both terms,

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.530
and if x is not equal
to 0, then we end up

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:29.660
with y equals to 3 minus x.

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.070
For the second part,
we can also here,

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.790
if g equals to 0, factorize y.

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.810
And we get either y
equals to 0, or we

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:44.095
have that x is
equal to y minus 1,

00:02:44.095 --> 00:02:47.460
where I just bring that
term to the other hand.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.080
So the critical point would be
either of these two entries.

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:59.130
It would be, for example, x
equals to 0 and this entry,

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.340
which would give
us y equals to 1;

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.940
or we would have y
equals to 0, and then

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.340
this entry would give
us x equals to 3.

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.140
And then the last
combined case, where

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:17.350
we have these two entries,
which corresponds to 1 and 2,

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.340
if you do it.

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.990
So let's look now
at the stability

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.950
of the linearization of
the system around each one

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:26.210
of these critical points.

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:28.260
So what do we do to
linearize the system?

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.700
Very quickly, we need
to compute the Jacobian

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.560
around each critical
point-- and we're just

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.120
going to build a table after
to do that-- where we basically

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.200
have f, a derivative of f
around x, derivative of g

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.330
around x, derivative of f around
y, derivative of g around y,

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.450
all this evaluated at
the critical point.

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.090
And this corresponds to
basically linearizing

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:56.880
our nonlinear system,
because you see here

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.630
that there are a lot
of nonlinear systems,

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.210
and studying the stability
around the neighborhood

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:03.560
of the critical point,
like if it was basically

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:04.990
linear around there.

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:08.070
This method has its limitations,
and we'll discuss them later.

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:13.010
So first I'm going
to just here give you

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.899
the results of computation
that I did earlier,

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:21.670
where basically you can
repeat this computation.

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:24.370
But I don't want to spend too
much time with the algebra

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:25.690
here.

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:28.065
So we have four critical points.

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:43.440
(0,0), (0,1), (3,0), and (1,2).

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.300
So this is going to just replace
the values for the Jacobian.

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.430
So here you compute
basically the derivative

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.660
of f of x with respect to x.

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.990
And you evaluate this at
then the value of (0,0).

00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:00.260
And so that would give
you [3,  0; 0, 1].

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.870
For this case, same thing.

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.490
We have the expression
for the Jacobian.

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.890
We evaluate it at
critical point (0,1).

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:12.670
And that gives us [2, 0; 1, -1].

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:18.370
For this one similarly, we
evaluate the Jacobian at (3,0).

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.020
And we get this Jacobian value.

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.890
And for this last
critical point,

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:29.490
we have this Jacobian value.

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:31.100
So now what's next?

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:35.140
So the Jacobian
basically gives us

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:37.680
the expression around
the critical point

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.100
to look at the system, like
if it was linear around there.

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:42.650
So from this point, we're
back to the linear methods

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:43.570
we learned before.

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:46.540
We need to compute the
eigenvalues of the Jacobian

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:49.040
around each critical point, and
then determine the structure

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:53.890
around each critical point
of the structure of basically

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:55.110
the phase portrait.

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:56.405
So what are the eigenvalues?

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:06.610
The eigenvalues are 3, 1,
and you can compute that

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:08.595
and verify for yourself.

00:06:11.185 --> 00:06:18.260
Plus or minus root of 7i
and the whole thing over 2.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.140
So here basically, we
have two real eigenvalues,

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:21.860
both positive.

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:23.480
So we're going to
have, basically,

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:29.949
an instability, unstable node.

00:06:29.949 --> 00:06:31.740
And it's just basically
the local stability

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.190
around the critical point.

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:35.740
Here we would have one
positive, one negative.

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:42.560
So this is a saddle,
which would be unstable.

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:45.130
The -3, 4 would give
us another saddle.

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:56.730
And these complex
eigenvalues would basically

00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:00.550
give us a spiral with
the real part going

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:05.790
to 0, with the real
part being negative.

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:09.939
So a spiral that's
stable, asymptotically.

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:14.730
So let's just do
the diagram here.

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:17.945
And I'll continue
the discussion.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:28.200
So let's consider only the case
where x and y are positive,

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.560
because we're talking
about populations.

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.650
And let's place our
critical points.

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:37.150
So we have a first critical
point here at (0,0).

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:41.590
We have a second critical
point here at (0,1).

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:45.020
We have a third
critical point at (3,0),

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:50.230
and the last critical
point at basically (1,2),

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:51.674
or something around there.

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:59.160
So now, based on the information
we have on this table,

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.320
we have the eigenvalues.

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:04.160
We could also compute the
corresponding eigenvectors.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.622
And you can compute that.

00:08:05.622 --> 00:08:07.580
And I'm not going to get
into the details here,

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:09.870
but basically the values
of the eigenvectors

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:12.870
would be important to
give you, for example,

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:14.950
the direction of your spiral.

00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:19.880
But we will do that on
the diagram as we go.

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:26.650
So here at the (0,0)
point is an unstable node.

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:30.320
So basically, the
solutions are going away

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:33.770
from this point in the x and y.

00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:39.409
This point, (0,1) is a saddle.

00:08:39.409 --> 00:08:42.659
So we basically are
on the ray here.

00:08:42.659 --> 00:08:45.770
You would compute that the
eigenvector that corresponds

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:47.810
to this negative
eigenvalue would actually

00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:50.380
be in the direction
[0,1] and would

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:52.360
converge toward this solution.

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:55.260
And you can compute that
the other eigenvector,

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.220
corresponding to
the eigenvalue 2,

00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:02.630
would have a
direction this form.

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:05.666
So here we neglect
what's happening here,

00:09:05.666 --> 00:09:07.710
but it would be
in this direction.

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:11.010
And the solutions would be
basically going away from here.

00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:20.990
And we would have locally
something like that.

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:24.720
For this point,
which corresponds

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:28.960
to an unstable node,
basically the solution

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:30.960
would be going away.

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:34.160
For this point, which
corresponds to (3,0),

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:37.610
we have a saddle again,
which is unstable.

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:41.460
And here you can compute that
the eigenvector corresponding

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:45.070
to the negative
eigenvalue would basically

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:46.970
be parallel to the x-axis.

00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:49.790
So it would have
coordinates (1,0).

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:51.660
And the eigenvector
corresponding

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:56.700
to the eigenvalue 4 would be
directed in this direction.

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:59.250
And basically, the solution
would be fleeing from there.

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:03.350
So locally, we would
have something like that,

00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:06.110
like we did before.

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:12.330
So we'll complete the graph.

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:16.840
Now, let's focus on the
last critical point, (1,2).

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:19.000
So this point
corresponds to a spiral.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.480
And it's a stable spiral
-- asymptotically stable,

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.040
because this
eigenvalue's negative.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:27.080
So the solutions are
going toward this point.

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:32.667
And you can look at the lower
entry here of the matrix, which

00:10:32.667 --> 00:10:34.250
is positive, which
means that we would

00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:36.070
be going counterclockwise.

00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:47.060
So we would have something there
would be looking like this,

00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:49.260
going toward this point.

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.480
So that's roughly
what we would have

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:57.752
for the three critical points.

00:10:57.752 --> 00:10:58.460
Am I missing one?

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:02.450
For the four critical points.

00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:05.460
And so now we can
complete our diagram

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:08.610
by basically linking to
different localized phase

00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:09.900
portraits together.

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:11.366
And so what will we have here?

00:11:11.366 --> 00:11:13.240
So for example, we would
have a solution here

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:15.615
that would be escaping, if we
start in this neighborhood,

00:11:15.615 --> 00:11:17.410
would be escaping from
this critical point.

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:20.030
But then eventually,
it would get attracted

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:22.300
by this other
critical point, which

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:25.142
when it enters its
basin of attraction,

00:11:25.142 --> 00:11:27.725
given that it's asymptotically
stable would be attracted by it

00:11:27.725 --> 00:11:28.690
and go here.

00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:32.250
If we started from
a very high y-value,

00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:36.660
we would be going down and
then eventually getting close

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:37.750
to this critical point.

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:42.290
That would then basically
cause this trajectory

00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:46.470
to, again, escape and
go feed this spiral

00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:50.190
by reaching the basin of
attraction of this point.

00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:55.470
If we look at the
critical point (3,0),

00:11:55.470 --> 00:12:00.630
then if we start with a
population x that is very large

00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:03.550
and we approach this point, then
we would have a solution that

00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:08.290
basically would eventually
continue parallel

00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:13.940
to this ray of the unstable part
of the critical point (3,0),

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:15.820
follow this ray and
eventually basically

00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:21.500
just be far more parallel
to this trajectory that

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:24.886
links this linear
(3,0) critical point

00:12:24.886 --> 00:12:27.570
to the (1,2) critical point.

00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:30.451
And so we can
complete the diagram

00:12:30.451 --> 00:12:31.700
by having something like this.

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:34.230
Now for this point,
what do we have?

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:37.150
So for this point, we
also have the solutions

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:43.410
that would be basically
fleeing from the point (0,0),

00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:46.930
and eventually could be
attracted to the spiral

00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:48.810
as well.

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:52.610
So that we give
us then something

00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:57.681
like this, a trajectory that
would be looking like that.

00:12:57.681 --> 00:13:02.220
And basically these trajectories
would be looking like that.

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:08.390
And I'm not going to complete
the parts where y and x are not

00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:09.430
positive.

00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:13.310
So we can complete the phase
diagram of this nonlinear

00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:14.490
system in this way.

00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:16.250
So now, how do we
interpret this?

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:18.250
What does this mean?

00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:22.310
Well, if we remind ourselves of
what this is actually modeling,

00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:24.790
and if we just look
at, for example,

00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:27.825
the different axes, what
does the y equals 0,

00:13:27.825 --> 00:13:29.060
x equals 0 point mean?

00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:31.260
It means that basically
we have 0 population

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:32.790
of prey, 0 of predator.

00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:36.100
And so it makes sense
that we have basically

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:40.770
an unstable point here, an
unstable critical point,

00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:43.599
because as soon as we add
one prey or one predator,

00:13:43.599 --> 00:13:45.640
we would have an increase
of the prey population,

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:47.720
eventually the
predator would grow,

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:49.220
and so we would
have a solution that

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:52.495
basically escapes the area
around the critical point

00:13:52.495 --> 00:13:55.110
(0,0).

00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:59.860
What would happen if we just
looked at the axis y equals

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:02.840
to 0? y equals to 0
corresponds to dynamics

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:08.130
where we don't have the
predator population.

00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:09.820
So the prey is just
living its life,

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:11.490
growing at logistic growth.

00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:15.040
And so basically, it's attracted
by the carrying capacity

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:16.880
that would be here set at 3.

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:18.730
And so if we start
with a lot of prey,

00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:21.345
eventually they die out until
they reach population 3.

00:14:21.345 --> 00:14:23.095
And if we start with
not enough, they grow

00:14:23.095 --> 00:14:27.170
and they reach population 3,
without the predator around.

00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:29.300
Same thing for the
predator on its own.

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:31.740
Now if we put the
two together then

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:34.580
we have a spiral, which means
that we have oscillation.

00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:42.570
If we have a lot of predators,
we have very few prey.

00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:46.030
And eventually the predators
start dying off as well.

00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:49.090
But then, because
they start dying off,

00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:52.460
the prey population starts
increasing, which then gives

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:54.280
an increase of the predator.

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:56.180
So we get, eventually,
an oscillation that

00:14:56.180 --> 00:15:00.630
goes to this attractor, (1,2),
where the system will stabilize

00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:03.040
eventually, where we
would have, basically, one

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:04.530
prey for two predators.

00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:06.790
So that ends the
interpretation of the system.

00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:10.060
And the idea here
was to basically

00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:14.260
use what we learned
for the linear systems,

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:17.730
in terms of the phase
portrait, and to see

00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:21.630
how we can apply that
to the nonlinear cases,

00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:24.890
after linearizing the
system around each one

00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:26.100
of the critical points.

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:27.920
What I should also
mention here is

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:30.320
that in all these cases
that we looked at,

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:32.800
we had cases that were
structurally stable,

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:37.610
which means that in our
determinant-trace diagram,

00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:39.900
we weren't at any
borderline case

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:41.730
where a little
perturbation could

00:15:41.730 --> 00:15:44.940
make the structure around
the critical point change

00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:45.780
radically.

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:48.080
So all these points are
structurally stable,

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:52.070
and the linearization
therefore is valid around them.

00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:54.208
And that ends this recitation.
