00:00:06.058 --> 00:00:07.080
PROFESSOR: Hi, everyone.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.939
Welcome back.

00:00:08.939 --> 00:00:11.230
In this problem, I'd like to
take a look at convolution

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.450
and Green's formula.

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:15.380
Specifically, for
part one, we're

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.920
just asked to compute
the convolution of t

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.120
with itself, t.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.620
In the second part, we're asked
to compute the convolution of e

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:29.590
to the minus k*t with another
exponential, e to the a*t.

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:34.180
And then in part B, we're to use
the result from part A as well

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.050
as Green's formula to solve
x dot plus k*x equals e

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.370
to the a*t.

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.540
And specifically, we're
interested in the rest

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.760
initial condition
solution to this formula.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:45.260
OK.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.070
So I'll let you think
about this problem,

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.278
and I'll be back in a minute.

00:01:01.774 --> 00:01:02.880
Hi, everyone.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.280
Welcome back.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.380
OK, so for part one,
we're asked to compute

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.806
the convolution of two
functions, t with itself,

00:01:09.806 --> 00:01:12.430
and I'll just quickly write down
the formula for a convolution.

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.960
So if I have two
functions, f and g,

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.920
then the convolution is
defined as, in this case,

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.680
the integral from
zero to t of f,

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.826
so the function f,
evaluated at, we're

00:01:29.826 --> 00:01:32.790
going to use tau as the
integration variable,

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:40.260
multiply by g, t
minus tau, d tau.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.960
So notice how the
variable t appears

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.370
in two places in this formula.

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.880
It appears in one place
in the argument of g,

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.790
and it appears in the
bound of integration.

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.490
Meanwhile, tau is the variable
we're integrating over,

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:02.170
and tau appears in two places
as well, one in f and one in g.

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.490
So if we're interested
in t convolved with t,

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:18.760
we have the integral from zero
to t of tau times t minus tau.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.910
So notice how f is
just t and g is t,

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.410
so when we insert tau and t
minus tau into the function,

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.910
we end up just getting tau
times t minus tau, d tau.

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.360
And just expanding this
out, we have t times tau

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.230
minus tau squared, d tau.

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.260
So in the integral,
the variable t always

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.385
appears just as a constant.

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.140
So in this case, we
have t, tau integrated

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.420
becomes t squared over 2.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:02.330
When I integrate from zero
to t, tau squared integrates

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:11.110
to 1/3 t cubed,
and zero drops out

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.970
from the other end
of the integral.

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:19.470
So we end up with t
cubed, 1/2 minus 1/3,

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.630
which is equal to 1/6 t cubed.

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.180
So there's the answer
we're looking for.

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.510
For part B, or for
question two, again we

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:30.870
have another computation to do.

00:03:33.317 --> 00:03:34.900
So we have more
integrals to work out.

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:40.905
And in this case,
it's two exponentials.

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.650
So we have zero to t.

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.850
The first one is going
to be e to the k*tau.

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:02.580
And the second one is e to
the a t minus tau, d tau.

00:04:06.315 --> 00:04:07.690
So we can just
expand things out,

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:20.267
and I get e to the a*t times
e to the minus a plus k tau d

00:04:20.267 --> 00:04:25.200
tau, zero to t.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.870
And again, because t is just
a dummy variable in this

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.110
integral, we're not
integrating over t,

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.800
I can just think of e to
the a*t as a constant.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.930
So I'm really just
integrating the function e

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.160
to the minus a plus k tau.

00:04:42.852 --> 00:04:44.310
And when I integrate
this function,

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:55.720
I get 1 over minus a plus
k, e to the minus a plus k,

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.010
tau evaluated at the
bounds, zero and t.

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.424
So the negative sign here
just flips the bounds.

00:05:12.424 --> 00:05:13.930
So we have a plus k.

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:23.680
Substituting in zero
just gives us 1,

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.273
and then substituting in t gives
us e to the minus a plus k*t.

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.978
And I can expand out,
multiply out, e to the a*t.

00:05:37.714 --> 00:05:44.800
And when the dust settles,
we have e to the a*t minus e

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:45.510
to the minus k*t.

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:54.770
So this is just the computation
of the convolution e

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:58.510
to the minus k*t
and e to the a*t.

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:03.400
So note now if, for example,
k were to equal negative a,

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.750
we would have zero
in the denominator

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:07.530
and zero on the numerator.

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:10.650
So one way to compute
the special case when

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:14.950
k is equal to negative a
is to use L'Hopital's Rule

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:18.670
and differentiate the top
and the bottom, for example,

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:19.600
with respect to k.

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:27.920
Another alternative way of
computing the special case when

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:34.790
a is equal to negative k is
just to plug in e to the k,

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:36.669
and then just work
out this integral,

00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:38.210
and you'll obtain
a different answer.

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:43.590
And now lastly, for
part B, we're interested

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:49.790
in the differential equation
x dot plus k*x equals e

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:51.430
to the a*t.

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:53.960
And we're interested in finding
the particular solution that

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.570
has rest initial conditions.

00:06:56.570 --> 00:07:00.070
So for example, x of
zero is equal to zero.

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.160
And we want to use
Green's formula.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:11.130
So just recall that there's
the impulse response

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:17.960
formula for the
weight function w,

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:19.810
which solves the same
differential equation,

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:21.935
but with the delta function
on the right-hand side.

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:31.560
And w, in this case, as
we've seen in lecture,

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:38.470
is actually e to the negative
k*t when t is bigger than zero,

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:40.520
and at zero when t
is less than zero.

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:47.560
So notice how e to the minus k*t
is exactly the function that we

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:51.250
convolved in part
A. Specifically,

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:53.880
we convolved it
with e to the a*t.

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:57.750
So for example, Green's formula
says that the particular

00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:01.350
solution that has rest initial
conditions is going to be

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:06.030
the weight function convolved
with the right-hand side

00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:12.040
of the differential
equation, e to the a*t.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:15.510
In this case, on the
domain of integration

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:18.280
for the convolution, w is
just e to the minus k*t.

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:29.350
So we have e to the minus k*t
convolved with e to the a*t.

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:33.720
So Green's formula
gives us the solution

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:35.220
to this differential
equation, which

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:37.229
has rest initial conditions.

00:08:37.229 --> 00:08:39.770
And specifically-- we've already
worked this out from part A,

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:42.561
so I can just write
down what the answer is.

00:08:42.561 --> 00:08:50.525
It's 1 over a plus k, e to the
a*t, minus e to the minus k*t.

00:08:55.357 --> 00:08:56.940
And just as a quick
check to make sure

00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:58.481
that we've done
everything correctly,

00:08:58.481 --> 00:08:59.850
we can plug in t equals zero.

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:04.560
And when t equals zero, we have
1 minus 1, which gives us zero.

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:07.220
So indeed, this
x is the solution

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:09.119
to this differential
equation, which

00:09:09.119 --> 00:09:10.285
has rest initial conditions.

00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:16.550
I'd just like to
conclude this problem.

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:18.180
Quick recap.

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:20.340
We worked out
several convolutions,

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:25.550
and specifically we were able to
use Green's formula in addition

00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:27.234
to the convolution
that we worked out

00:09:27.234 --> 00:09:29.400
to compute the solution
with rest initial conditions

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:31.220
to an ODE.

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:34.780
Moreover, Green's function
is very useful because notice

00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:36.530
how we could have
computed the convolution

00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:39.170
for any right-hand
side function here.

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:43.747
So in some sense, we're able to
generalize and find solutions

00:09:43.747 --> 00:09:46.330
to differential equations which
have arbitrary right-hand side

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:50.279
forcings, not just sines and
cosines, periodic functions,

00:09:50.279 --> 00:09:51.820
or other simple
functions which we've

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:54.410
been looking at in the past.

00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:57.810
So I'd like to conclude here,
and I'll see you next time.
