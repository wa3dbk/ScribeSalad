00:00:05.379 --> 00:00:07.030
PROFESSOR: Hi everyone.

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:08.780
Welcome back.

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:10.550
So in this problem,
I'd like to take

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.874
a look at autonomous
equations and phase lines.

00:00:13.874 --> 00:00:16.290
And specifically, we're going
to take a look at the simple

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.820
equation x dot
equals a*x plus 1,

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.530
which models births and death
rates and a fixed replenishment

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:26.010
rate for a population.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.930
So in this case, the
variable a represents births

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.050
minus deaths in a population.

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.410
And 1 represents the constant
input of new creatures.

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.060
So for part A, we're
asked to find intervals

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.870
of the variable
a which determine

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.430
the long-time stability
of the population.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.340
And then secondly,
for each typical case

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.540
of a in the first
part of the problem,

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.350
we're asked to
sketch a phase line

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.550
and then also to sketch the
solution x of t versus t.

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.600
So I'll let you take a
look at this problem,

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.214
and I'll be back in a moment.

00:01:23.337 --> 00:01:24.380
Hi Everyone.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.950
Welcome back.

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.280
So the problem we're looking
at is x dot equals a*x.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.320
And as mentioned in the
title of the problem,

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.540
this is an autonomous
equation which

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.210
means that the right-hand side
is not a function of time.

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.240
The right-hand side
only depends on x.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.400
And for these types of
problems, the critical points

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.340
or the points at which
the right-hand side vanish

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.340
tend to determine the
long-time characteristics

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.420
of the solution.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.220
So we can kind of get a
handle on what intervals of a

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:11.760
determine the long-time
stability by sketching what

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.290
x dot versus x might look like.

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.070
And we see that
if a is positive,

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:29.280
this represents a line
with a positive slope a.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:40.984
So on the right-hand side of
the intercept with the x-axis,

00:02:40.984 --> 00:02:50.500
x dot is positive, which means
that when the line goes through

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:56.215
the point x dot equals 0, the
term a*x plus 1 is going to be

00:02:56.215 --> 00:02:56.715
positive.

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.390
I'll just point out that
this point right here

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.670
is when x dot is equal to 0.

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:14.030
And this happens when x is
equal to negative 1 over a.

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.970
So this point right here
is negative 1 over a.

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.516
And when x is below
negative 1 over a,

00:03:26.516 --> 00:03:29.607
x dot is negative, which
means that solutions

00:03:29.607 --> 00:03:31.940
will want to move away from
the point negative 1 over a.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.130
What other qualitative
behavior could we have?

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:47.530
Well, when a is below 0,
when a is less than 0,

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.100
the slope of this curve
is going to be negative.

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.250
So I'll plot again
x dot versus x.

00:03:56.862 --> 00:03:59.070
And again, the intercept is
going to be at negative 1

00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.569
over a.

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.612
However, when x is above
the critical point,

00:04:07.612 --> 00:04:09.920
x dot is negative.

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.130
So solutions will want to tend
to move back towards negative 1

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.270
over a.

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:17.380
And when x is below
the critical point,

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.700
we see that x dot is in
the upper plane, which

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:22.829
means it's positive.

00:04:22.829 --> 00:04:24.120
So solutions will want to grow.

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.390
So we have two cases right now.

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:31.700
One is when a is bigger than 0.

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.684
One is when a is less than 0.

00:04:33.684 --> 00:04:35.100
And then, of course,
there's going

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:42.790
to be an intermediate point,
which is when a is equal to 0.

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:56.280
And in this case, the
curve x dot versus x,

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.290
it's just going to be a straight
line hat goes through 1.

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:08.280
So this gives us three
regions that will determine

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.840
the long-time behavior.

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:17.410
So the three regions are
a equals 0, a less than 0,

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:21.000
and then a bigger than 0.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.890
So this concludes part
A. And for part B,

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:27.610
we're asked to investigate the
behavior of each of these three

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:31.950
regions by constructing
a phase line,

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:33.790
and then, secondly, by
sketching a solution

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:34.664
or several solutions.

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:46.230
So for part B, let's take
a look at the case when

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:48.700
a is bigger than 0 first.

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.290
And I'm just going to
pick one value of a.

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:56.590
I'll just pick a is equal to 1
to work things out concretely.

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:01.660
And we're asked to
sketch a phase line.

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:03.335
So plot the phase line x here.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.570
And we know from the ODE
that the critical point

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:10.880
occurs at negative 1 over a.

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.160
So in this case, there's going
to be one critical point,

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.800
and it's going to
be at negative 1.

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:21.190
Now when x is bigger
than negative 1,

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:27.390
we've already seen that x
dot is going to be positive.

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:32.040
So when x is bigger than
negative 1, in this region,

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:35.000
x dot is positive.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.410
So above negative 1,
x dot is positive,

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:41.170
which means that if
a solution starts

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:44.640
at a point above
negative 1, it's going

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:48.800
to constantly increase forever.

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.890
And likewise, if it's
below negative 1,

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:53.940
it's going to decrease forever.

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:58.160
So this is x dot is
negative in this region.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:06.824
And of course, x dot is 0
at the critical point, which

00:07:06.824 --> 00:07:08.490
means if we start at
the critical point,

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:11.159
we stay there for all time.

00:07:11.159 --> 00:07:12.450
So let's sketch some solutions.

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:23.830
So whenever I have to sketch
solutions for a phase line,

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:25.550
the first solution
I always plot is

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:27.940
going to be the critical point.

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:30.831
So note that x equals negative
1 solves the differential

00:07:30.831 --> 00:07:31.330
equation.

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:34.010
So x equals a critical point
always solves the differential

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:35.500
equation.

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:41.632
So that means when x
is equal to negative 1,

00:07:41.632 --> 00:07:43.090
we solve the
differential equation.

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:50.190
When x is bigger
than negative 1,

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:51.500
we attain exponential growth.

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:00.430
And when x is less
than negative 1,

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:05.020
we have exponential growth
in the opposite direction.

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:09.590
So this is sometimes said to
be an unstable critical point,

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:12.410
because any small perturbation
away from negative 1

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:15.230
will make the solution diverge.

00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:19.690
Also note that once I
have one of these curves,

00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:23.000
I can generate all the others by
just picking it up and shifting

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.110
it over.

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:28.601
And the reason this works is
because the original equation

00:08:28.601 --> 00:08:30.850
is autonomous, meaning that
the right-hand side didn't

00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:33.150
depend on time.

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:35.266
So whenever you have
an autonomous equation,

00:08:35.266 --> 00:08:36.640
when you sketch
one solution, you

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:38.850
can always get the
others by just picking--

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:40.539
or you can always get
a family of others

00:08:40.539 --> 00:08:42.730
by picking up that solution and
just shifting it to the right

00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:43.480
and to the left.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:56.280
Now when a is below
0, I'll just pick

00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:01.090
the value of a
equals negative 1,

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:04.820
we have a critical point at 1.

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:06.640
And in this case,
the arrows are going

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:09.970
to point towards 1 like this.

00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:19.480
And again, I can
sketch some curves.

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:31.680
So I'll first draw the
solution when x is equal to 1.

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:36.080
And in this case,
solutions are going

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:40.380
to converge towards
the critical point.

00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:49.015
And in this case, we say that
the critical point x equals 1

00:09:49.015 --> 00:09:49.515
is stable.

00:09:54.450 --> 00:10:05.390
And that's because any small
perturbation in the solution

00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:08.180
will eventually just come back
to the critical point at x

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:08.810
equals 1.

00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:14.900
And now lastly, we
have the third case

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:16.330
which is when a equals 0.

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:22.050
And in this case, there
are no critical points.

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:25.330
In fact, x dot was equal to 1.

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:30.900
So x dot is positive
for all values of x.

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:34.930
So our phase line is
just a line with arrows.

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:39.440
And in this case, if I were
to sketch some solutions,

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:45.990
I'll just draw my axes, x and
t, there are no critical points.

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:48.160
X is just increasing.

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.700
So the solutions are going
to look something like this.

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:57.460
They're just going to be a
family of straight lines.

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:04.530
So we've just sketched
some phase lines,

00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:06.940
and we sketched several
solutions for each phase line.

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:10.510
We've seen how the critical
points and the arrows

00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:12.950
around the critical points
affect the long time

00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:15.130
behavior of the solutions.

00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:18.140
And this is
typically the process

00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:22.900
that you go through when
looking at autonomous equations.

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:26.277
You always first, A, find
the critical points, then B,

00:11:26.277 --> 00:11:28.110
find the regions between
the critical points

00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:32.160
and figure out if x dot is
either positive or negative.

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:35.987
And then that automatically
gives you the phase line.

00:11:35.987 --> 00:11:38.320
Once you have the phase line,
you can always just sketch

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:41.140
a family of solutions.

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:42.600
So I'd like to conclude here.

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:44.860
And I'll see you next time.
