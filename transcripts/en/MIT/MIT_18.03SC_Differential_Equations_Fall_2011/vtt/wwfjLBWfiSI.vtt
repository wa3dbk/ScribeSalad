DAVID SHIROKOFF: Hi, everyone.

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.260
Welcome back.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.261
So today I'd like to take a
look at gain and phase lag.

00:00:12.261 --> 00:00:14.260
And we're going to consider
this simple problem.

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.620
So first off, find a periodic
solution to x dot dot plus 8x

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:23.850
dot plus 7x equals F_0
times cosine omega*t.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.430
So basically, it's just
forcing a differential equation

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.800
with some frequency
cosine omega t.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.000
And the problem we're
interested in today

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.111
is to give the gain and phase
lag to this periodic solution.

00:00:36.111 --> 00:00:38.610
So I'll let you take a look at
this problem and I'll be back

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:39.109
in a minute.

00:00:49.852 --> 00:00:51.430
Hi, everyone.

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:52.880
Welcome back.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.460
OK, so we're interested in
finding this periodic solution

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.110
to the differential equation.

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.390
And we see here that we're
forcing it with right-hand side

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.370
of cosine omega*t.

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.480
So the standard procedure
is to first complexify.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.560
So we're going to consider the
differential equation x dot dot

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:23.390
plus 8x dot plus 7x equals
F_0 e to the i*omega*t.

00:01:26.024 --> 00:01:27.690
And then at the end,
we're going to take

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.980
the real part of our solution
to this differential equation.

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.810
And we do this because cosine
omega*t is the real part of e

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.770
to the i omega t.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.890
Now, for this equation,
we see that we're

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.099
forcing it with an exponential.

00:01:42.099 --> 00:01:44.265
So we can just use the
exponential response formula.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.790
And this gives us a
particular solution.

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.630
So the exponential response
formula is 1 over p of i*omega

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:05.150
times the right-hand side,
which is F_0 e to the i*omega*t.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.450
And in this case, the
characteristic polynomial,

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:15.360
p of s, is s squared
plus 8s plus 7.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:22.360
So that p of i*omega is going
to be 7 minus omega squared--

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.590
so the omega squared comes
from s squared-- plus 8i*omega.

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.810
Now, I'd just like
to take a moment

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.562
and step back for a second.

00:02:33.562 --> 00:02:35.520
If we take a look at the
differential equation,

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:41.040
the input on the right-hand
side is F_0 e to the i*omega*t.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.350
Now notice how this
characteristic-- sorry,

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.110
the exponential response formula
gives us a particular solution,

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:53.850
which is 1 over p of i*omega
F_0 e to the i*omega*t,

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.490
which is a periodic solution.

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:03.140
But moreover, the output
of this formula shows that

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.540
it's actually the input forcing
multiplied by this factor 1

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.300
over p of i*omega.

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.810
So this factor right
here, 1 over p of i omega

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.290
relates the input forcing
to the output forcing.

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.812
Or sorry, to the
output response.

00:03:19.812 --> 00:03:22.020
And this factor is sometimes
called the complex gain.

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:29.730
And the reason it's the complex
gain is because if we take

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.200
a look at p of i*omega, it has
a real part and an imaginary

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.680
part.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:46.425
So specifically, p of
i*omega contains two pieces

00:03:46.425 --> 00:03:47.050
of information.

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:01.040
Because it's a
complex number, we

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.430
can think of it as being
an amplitude and a phase.

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:15.130
So the amplitude of p of
i*omega is It's sometimes called

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.680
the gain.

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:25.500
And the phase of p of
i*omega is the phase lag.

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.140
So p of i*omega contains
two pieces of information,

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:38.710
which relate the input forcing
signal to the output response

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.270
of the differential equation.

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:45.240
Now, I'd like to go ahead and
write x of t, decomplexify.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:50.170
So we're going to take the real
part of 1 over p of i*omega

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:53.730
times F_0 e to the i*omega*t.

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:59.950
So we have 7 minus omega
squared plus 8i*omega.

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.260
Upstairs is F_0 e
to the i*omega*t.

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.670
And I'm going to just put
this in amplitude-phase form.

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:18.215
And when I take the real part,
I'll do it in two steps first.

00:05:23.651 --> 00:05:26.867
8 omega squared.

00:05:26.867 --> 00:05:27.450
Square rooted.

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:35.220
F_0 e to i*omega*t
divided by e to the i*phi.

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:53.800
Where here phi is the
phase lag and tangent phi

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.125
is going to be the imaginary
part over the real part.

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:10.180
And just quickly note that as
omega goes from 0 to infinity,

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:13.640
tangent phi will
go from 0 to pi.

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:26.660
So this is the range of phi
that we're interested in.

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:33.250
And now, when we
take the real part,

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:38.740
we end up with F_0 1 over 7
minus omega squared quantity

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:46.220
squared plus 8 omega
squared, all squared rooted,

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:48.890
cosine omega*t minus phi.

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:56.800
And now we'd like to look at
what the amplitude and phase

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.350
are as a function of omega.

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:02.030
So for each fixed
omega, the output

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:04.910
is going to be a
sinusoid which oscillates

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:06.850
at the same frequency
as the input.

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:09.130
However, the only difference
is that it's going

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:12.180
to have a rescaled amplitude.

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:16.420
And it will have a
shifted phase as well.

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:23.230
So for the amplitude response,
we're interested in plotting 1

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:26.545
over the amplitude
of p of i*omega.

00:07:26.545 --> 00:07:27.545
So here's the amplitude.

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:39.320
And this function is just going
to decrease and asymptotically

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:42.120
approach infinity.

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:44.260
So this is the
amplitude response.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:48.790
This is 1 over 7 minus
omega squared square rooted

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:53.264
plus 8omega squared,
quantity square rooted.

00:07:53.264 --> 00:07:54.840
This is omega.

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:00.737
And then in addition to
the amplitude response,

00:08:00.737 --> 00:08:01.695
we also have the phase.

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:09.470
And the phase, if I go
back up here for a second,

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:11.450
we can write it
explicitly as phi

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:19.710
is equal to tan inverse 8omega
divided by 7 minus omega

00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:20.210
squared.

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:29.170
So I'm going to plot omega on
this axis and phi on this axis.

00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:36.360
And, OK, so to plot this curve,
we note that when omega is 0,

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:38.386
tan inverse of 0 is 0.

00:08:38.386 --> 00:08:39.594
So we're going to start at 0.

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:46.010
Typically, what I usually
like to do in this case

00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:49.060
is look at the denominator
in the arctangent.

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:51.850
We see that when omega is
equal to the square root of 7,

00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:52.950
this argument blows up.

00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:54.590
It goes to infinity.

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:59.170
And the arctangent of
infinity is pi over 2.

00:08:59.170 --> 00:09:02.770
So I can draw a curve in
here, which is pi over 2.

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:10.240
So we know that phi is pi over
2 when omega is equal to root 7.

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:15.360
And note how this is the
natural frequency if there

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:16.790
was no damping in the system.

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:23.130
And then lastly, there's
another curve here at pi.

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:26.600
We see that as omega
approaches infinity, again,

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:29.125
this argument approaches 0.

00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:35.750
And if you were to take the
derivative of this whole

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:41.070
quantity, we would see that
it's-- of tan inverse of this

00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:44.310
argument, we would see that the
function's increasing for all

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:45.000
omega.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.910
So it actually looks
something like this.

00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:52.140
It looks like an s-shaped curve
that asymptotically approaches

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:56.440
pi as omega goes to infinity.

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:58.240
So just to quickly recap.

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:01.836
When we look at the
differential equation,

00:10:01.836 --> 00:10:04.210
or a particular solution to
a differential equation which

00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:09.140
is being forced by a
periodic sinusoidal function,

00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:12.290
the output is always
going to be rescaled

00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:14.940
and phase shifted,
but still oscillating

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:17.160
at the same frequency.

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.130
And specifically,
depending on which

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:23.030
frequency the differential
equation's forced at,

00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:26.135
the amplitude will take
on different values.

00:10:26.135 --> 00:10:29.140
The amplitude response will
take on different values.

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:32.800
And the phase shift will also
have different values depending

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:35.440
on the frequency of forcing.

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:37.000
So I'd just like
to conclude here,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.861
and I'll see you next time.
