DAVID SHIROKOFF: Hi, everyone.

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:07.360
Welcome back.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.150
So today, I'd like to tackle
a problem on direction fields.

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.290
So given a
differential equation,

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.160
y prime equals
negative y divided

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.400
by x squared plus
y squared, we're

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.080
asked to first sketch
the direction field.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.650
And then secondly,
given the curve

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.980
that goes through
y(0) equal to 1,

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.360
we're asked several
questions about it.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.820
Why is y of x greater than
0 for x greater than 0?

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.690
And then, why is
y of x decreasing

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:34.804
for x greater than 0?

00:00:34.804 --> 00:00:37.470
So I'll let you think about this
for a moment and I'll get back.

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.990
Hi, everyone.

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:49.650
Welcome back.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.590
OK, so to start
off this problem,

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.880
we're asked to sketch
the direction field.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.150
Now when asked to sketch
a direction field,

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.441
the first thing to do is to
look at a couple isoclines.

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.890
So what is an isocline?

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.760
Well, it's a curve
where the derivative y

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.665
prime is equal to m,
which is some constant.

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.690
So what are the isoclines for
this differential equation?

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.120
Well, it would be minus
y divided by x squared

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.660
plus y squared equals m.

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.350
Now, of particular
interest, there's

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.340
a very special isocline, which
is usually the easiest to plot.

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.550
And that's a nullcline.

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.090
And this is just a special
case where m is equal to 0.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.410
So what's the
nullcline for this ODE?

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:58.350
Well, when m is equal to 0, the
only way that y prime can be 0

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.903
is when y is 0.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.710
So the nullcline for
this ODE is y equals 0.

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.520
Now, for more general
isoclines, we're

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.440
left with this relation
between x and y.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.660
And we can massage
this expression

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.380
to see exactly what
the isoclines are.

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.370
So specifically, I'm
going to multiply through

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.780
by x squared plus y squared,
and I'm going to divide by m.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.090
And we see that we have
a quadratic in x and y.

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.910
And we have one linear term.

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.300
So whenever we have
a relation like this

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.350
and we want to understand
what it looks like,

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.470
typically the approach is
just to complete the square.

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.154
So I'm going to
bring the 1 over m y

00:02:48.154 --> 00:02:49.570
to the other side
of the equation.

00:02:59.724 --> 00:03:01.140
And I'm going to
combine it with y

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.550
squared to complete the square.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.990
And when we do this, we
obtain the following equation.

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.980
And we recognize this equation
as the equation for a circle.

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.280
Specifically, it's
a circle that's

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.930
centered at x is equal to 0
and y is equal to negative 1

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:36.520
over 2m.

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:45.340
And in addition, the
circle has a radius

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:50.660
r squared is equal to 1
over 4m squared, which

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.900
means its radius is 1 over 2
times the absolute value of m.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.020
OK, so why don't we take a look
and plot a couple isoclines?

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.099
So as I mentioned before,
typically the first isocline

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:18.640
that we should plot
is the nullcline,

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.420
which is m is equal to 0.

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:23.810
And we know that this
is y is equal to 0.

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.370
So all along the
line y is equal to 0,

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:32.090
I'm just going to draw dashes
that correspond to a slope of y

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.050
is equal to 0.

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.790
For the other isoclines, we just
have to pick some values of m

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:39.760
and start plotting.

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.170
So I'll take the value m
is equal to negative 1.

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:44.650
And when m is equal
to negative 1,

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.230
we have a circle which
is centered at 0 and 1/2

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:48.090
with radius 1/2.

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.030
So here's 1/2.

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:04.910
Here's 1.

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:07.650
And at every point
along the circle,

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:16.310
we just draw a little
slope of negative 1.

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.480
So at every point
along this curve,

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.320
the solution has
slope negative 1.

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:30.800
Now, in addition, we can also
get another circle, which

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.200
is centered at negative 1/2.

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.970
And this corresponds
to the isocline of m

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:38.850
is equal to plus 1.

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:48.050
And every point on this
circle has slope plus 1.

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:54.370
Those should all be the same.

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:56.280
And now we can pick
some other values of m.

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.520
So for example, m is equal to 2.

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.670
If m is equal to 2,
then we have a circle

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:05.330
which is centered at
negative 1/4 and radius 1/4.

00:06:10.079 --> 00:06:13.790
So it might look
something like this.

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:17.050
And m is equal to negative 2
might look something like this.

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:20.640
So this is m is
equal to negative 2.

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:21.966
This is m is equal to 2.

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:28.214
And the slope on this curve
is going to be steeper.

00:06:28.214 --> 00:06:29.380
It's going to be negative 2.

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.530
And the same goes
for this circle.

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:41.570
And then lastly, I
can draw a sketch of m

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:47.040
is equal to 3/4, which would
go up something like this.

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:54.470
Sorry, m is equal
to negative 3/4.

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:59.300
And that would have a slightly
weaker slope like this.

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:06.080
So notice how the
collection of isoclines

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:10.030
are a family of circles that
all are tangent to the origin.

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:11.560
And in fact, if
we think about it,

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.840
the nullcline, the
m equal 0 line,

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:15.600
is actually, in
some sense, a limit

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:18.400
circle where we take the
radius in the center going

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:19.310
to infinity.

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:22.310
So as the circles become
larger and larger,

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:27.030
they tend to approach
this line y equals 0.

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:29.820
So this concludes part one.

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:33.200
So for part two, we're now
asked several questions

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:37.450
about the curve which goes
through y(0) is equal to 1.

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:40.990
So I'll just sketch what this
solution curve might look like.

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:46.242
And it's going to start off
at a slope of negative 1.

00:07:46.242 --> 00:07:48.200
And then it's going to
hit these circles, which

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:49.340
have a steeper slope.

00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:53.450
And then eventually
it's going to go

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:55.116
through the circles
with a steeper slope

00:07:55.116 --> 00:07:58.350
and come back to the circle
that has slope negative 1.

00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:02.660
And eventually, decay outwards.

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:04.820
So this is what the solution
curve might look like.

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:12.080
I'm just sketching this to
set up parts 2a and 2b here.

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:16.990
OK, so why is y of x
always bigger than 0

00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:19.500
for x greater than 0?

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:24.060
Well, we see that
this solution curve

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:26.650
stays in the upper half plane.

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:35.299
And we note that y is equal
to 0, which is the nullcline,

00:08:35.299 --> 00:08:37.080
is actually a very
special curve.

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:40.330
Not only is it the nullcline,
but it's actually a solution

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:42.010
to the differential equation.

00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:44.650
So if we look back at the
differential equation,

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:48.244
we see that y is equal
to 0 has zero derivative.

00:08:48.244 --> 00:08:50.410
And the right-hand side of
the differential equation

00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:51.760
is also 0.

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:54.690
So this is not only a
nullcline, but it's a solution

00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:56.270
to the differential equation.

00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:58.580
Note that this is
extremely special.

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:01.140
In no way does
every nullcline have

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:03.060
to be a solution to a
differential equation.

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:06.690
But in this case, we get lucky.

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:08.560
Now we know from
the theory of ODEs

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:10.740
that solution
curves can't cross.

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:13.900
So a solution curve that
starts in the upper half plane

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:16.540
can't cross another
solution, which in this case

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:18.700
is the y equals 0 curve.

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:20.650
Hence, it must be
bounded in the upper half

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:22.270
plane for all x bigger than 0.

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:27.500
The second part, why
is y of x decreasing

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:28.800
for x greater than 0?

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:31.105
Well, what we have
to look at-- so

00:09:31.105 --> 00:09:33.050
I'll just write in here part 2.

00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:39.840
We have to look at
the sign of y prime.

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:43.340
Now y prime is equal
to negative y divided

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:46.590
by x squared plus y squared.

00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:48.730
So as I've just
argued, a solution

00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:50.650
that starts in the
upper half plane

00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:52.880
and goes through the point
y of 0 is equal to 1,

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:56.600
stays in the upper half plane
for all x bigger than 0.

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:59.150
What this means is
that the solution curve

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:03.570
has y bigger than 0 for
all x bigger than 0.

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:07.940
So that means the numerator
is always positive.

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:15.130
The denominator is
also always positive.

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:16.940
So we have negative
a positive number

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:18.770
divided by a positive number.

00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:24.120
And so this quantity is always
going to be less than 0.

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:26.940
So for x bigger than
0, y prime is always

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:28.500
going to be less than 0.

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:30.390
Hence, the solution
that starts at y of 0

00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:33.370
is equal to 1 is going to
monotonically decay to y

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:35.110
is equal to 0.

00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:35.810
OK?

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:37.840
So this concludes the problem.

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:41.250
Now just to recap,
we were given an ODE.

00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:44.180
The standard approach when
sketching direction fields

00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:46.020
is to pick a few nullclines.

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:48.560
Or to pick a few isoclines.

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:51.010
And specifically
pick the nullcline.

00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:53.500
Sketch the isoclines.

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:56.780
And then, if you're asked
to plot any integral curves

00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:58.830
or solutions to the
differential equation,

00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:01.540
you just simply
connect the dots.

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:03.720
OK, so I'd like
to conclude here,

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:05.990
and I'll see you next time.
