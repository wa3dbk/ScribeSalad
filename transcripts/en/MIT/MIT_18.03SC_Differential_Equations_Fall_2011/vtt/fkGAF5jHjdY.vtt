00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:06.350
PROFESSOR: Welcome back.

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:08.510
So in this session,
we're going to look

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.070
at sinusoidal inputs for
ordinary differential

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.330
equations of order one.

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.950
So here in question one, you're
asked to use complex techniques

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.400
to solve x dot plus k*x
equals cosine of omega*t.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.730
Here k and omega are constants.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.560
This is of ODE of first order.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.460
And the sinusoidal
input is referring

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.230
to the right-hand
side of the ODE

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.360
where basically
the we are forcing

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.430
a system with a
function, and it's

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.470
sinusoidal of angular frequency
omega, which means basically

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.260
a period of 2pi over omega.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.910
So you're asked to
use complex techniques

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.920
to solve this in question a.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.210
In question b, we're asked to
use what we had in question a

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.790
to solve this modified
function, where again, we

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.930
have a sinusoidal input
on the right-hand side

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.130
with an additional amplitude
F, which is now constant.

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.230
In the third part, we're asked
to use superposition principle

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.940
to solve this combined
equation, where now we're

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.930
introducing a value for
example for F, which is 3.

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.250
And you can see also that
the right-hand side is also

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.890
a sinusoidal input, because
it's a linear combination

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.630
of sinusoidal functions.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.230
All these equations are linear
with constant coefficients,

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.170
and hence superposition
principle would hold.

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.500
So why don't you stop the
video, take a few minutes,

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:27.750
and work through the problems.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:28.613
And we'll be back.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.170
Welcome back.

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.590
So what is it that
we're asked to do here?

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.950
We're asked to solve this
using a trick that you learned

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.260
in class to basically
convert a real-valued ODE

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.050
into a complex form.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:02:04.560
So the first thing to do is
to realize that the cosine

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:12.820
of omega*t is simply the real
part of the imaginary complex

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.920
exponential i*omega*t.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.820
So when we realize
that, and we see

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.410
that the ODE is
real-valued linear,

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:36.500
we can convert
this real-value ODE

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.538
into this complex-valued ODE.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.030
And we're going to label
this equation star.

00:02:59.449 --> 00:03:01.490
From this point, we can
go back to the techniques

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:04.450
that we learned in class,
namely the integrating factor,

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.340
to realize that we can
rewrite the right-hand side

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.320
in this form, introducing
a new function u,

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.425
so that we need
to seek a function

00:03:16.425 --> 00:03:19.885
u that will then recover
this function, this equation.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.880
And from previous
recitations and problem,

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.590
we saw that clearly the u that
we will need to pick is just

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.160
exponential of k*t.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:45.770
So now from this, basically
we're back to i*omega plus k,

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:47.900
the whole thing t, on
the right-hand side,

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.910
and here z*u prime that we
just need to integrate on both

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:53.930
sides.

00:03:53.930 --> 00:04:00.381
So this is simply k*t*z
on the left-hand side.

00:04:00.381 --> 00:04:02.630
And on the right-hand side,
we're integrating-- again,

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:07.550
it's still an exponential,
even though it's complex.

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:16.358
And we need to
introduce, of course,

00:04:16.358 --> 00:04:17.357
constant of integration.

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.640
So the solution for the
equation star is then,

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.500
I'm going to write it up
here, so that we keep that

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:37.170
for the rest of the problem,
minus t minus k*t when I divide

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:38.080
by this.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.070
And here, the minus k*t of
this exponential is going to be

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.770
canceled out by the
integrating factor.

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.020
So we need to keep that here.

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.600
So here I gave the
general solution

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.130
with the solution
that would come

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.720
from the homogeneous
equation, which we could refer

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.090
to also as a transient
here, because basically

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.370
after a long time t, this
exponential, if k is positive,

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:12.940
would decay.

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.370
And the part of
the solution that

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.750
comes from the sinusoidal
input, or the forcing, which

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:22.450
would be particular solution.

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:24.770
So to go back to the
original question,

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:28.300
we were asked to solve
this real-valued equation.

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.490
So from what we
noticed above, we

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:31.990
saw that the
right-hand side is just

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:35.060
a real part of the right-hand
side of the complex value

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:36.390
equation star.

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:42.400
And similarly then,
we can do the same

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.590
for the actual
solutions themselves.

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:48.210
x is also just the real
value of this complex number.

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:49.970
So here, for this
general solution,

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:55.210
I'm going to just use c bar for
general complex constant here.

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:57.420
And in this case, we
will take the real value.

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:00.430
So at this point, it doesn't
really matter what t is.

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:02.580
It's just we're going to
keep it as a constant.

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:06.290
And now it's just real valued.

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:07.670
That's for the one part.

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:15.640
And then we need to take the
real part of this expression.

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:17.360
Come back to the line here.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.614
So to take the real
part of this expression,

00:06:21.614 --> 00:06:23.280
you learned that
basically you just need

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:26.630
to multiply the denominator
or the numerator

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:27.705
by the complex conjugate.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:49.320
And that will only give us--
so we have k minus i*omega over

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:53.550
the squares, and then again,
Euler formula that we saw

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:55.590
in a previous recitation.

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:58.040
So x, from this
expression, is just

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:59.556
the real part of all of this.

00:06:59.556 --> 00:07:00.805
So it's going to be this term.

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:13.010
Let me factorize
for a moment here,

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:15.420
and then the result
of multiplying the two

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:17.920
complex parts as
well, i to i, minus 1.

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:30.540
And so that answers
part a of the problem.

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:32.710
So if we look at
part b-- I'm just

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:38.460
going to do it
here-- part b we're

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:41.020
asked to do to solve a
very, very similar equation.

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:50.720
And I'm just going to
leave the F out for now.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.780
It's basically
the same equation,

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:56.250
except that the input now is
a sine instead of a cosine.

00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:59.590
So we can use the same trick
as we used for question a

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:01.900
by realizing that
now the sine is just

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:10.432
an imaginary part
of the exponential,

00:08:10.432 --> 00:08:13.940
the complex exponential.

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:16.080
So we don't need to
redo all the work.

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.860
We only need to, if we were
considering this equation,

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:21.170
to just take the imaginary
part of the solution

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:22.920
that we just found here.

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:26.850
And we can just read off
the solution from this line.

00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:33.679
Note that in this
expression, I left out

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:40.520
the homogeneous part, which
I should add here from here.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.330
And this was just
a complex part.

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:44.480
So to come back to
what I was saying,

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.070
the sine is just
the imaginary part

00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:47.350
of the complex exponential.

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:51.920
So we're just going to
write down the solution

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:54.000
by reading off here.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.610
So again, we have
the homogeneous part,

00:08:57.610 --> 00:09:01.960
which would be another
real-valued constant,

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:10.320
and then the real part of
this expression, 1 over k

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:12.620
squared plus omega squared.

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:21.880
And its imaginary part then
would give us a k sine omega*t

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:32.010
and a minus omega cos omega*t.

00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:34.060
So this would be the
solution for part

00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:37.000
b, if we had this equation.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.100
But we actually have an equation
with an additional amplitude F.

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:43.890
And what this
leads to do is just

00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:47.590
an additional constant
that would appear then

00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:48.820
for this solution.

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:51.090
And we could see that
if we rewound the way

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:54.740
we solved in part a,
and saw that introducing

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:57.400
constant F to the equation is
equivalent to just multiplying

00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:59.310
the full equation
with F. And then

00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:02.190
in the integrating
factor part, we

00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:04.400
would end up with an F
in front of our solution

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:05.990
when we are doing
the integration.

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:07.950
And so basically,
that amplitude could

00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:10.950
be absorbed in the
constant of integration

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:13.300
for the homogeneous part.

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:19.310
And the F just remains in
the particular solution here.

00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:29.630
So for the last
part of the problem,

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:33.500
we were now asked to use
the superposition principle

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:44.440
to combine solutions of two
previous ODEs that we could

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:54.740
split from this equation, cosine
omega*t plus 3 sine omega*t.

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:57.050
So you saw from
previous recitations

00:10:57.050 --> 00:10:59.990
that superposition principle
applies for linear equations.

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:01.882
This is clearly a
linear equation.

00:11:01.882 --> 00:11:03.340
And here on the
right-hand side, we

00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:05.400
have two sinusoidal functions.

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:09.270
Because it's linear
we can look at this

00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:15.400
by splitting it
into two equations.

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:18.240
And I'm just introducing
x_1, x_2 as notation

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:19.670
to distinguish between the two.

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:28.300
And here we can
recognize that we already

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:30.430
did this work that
was in part a,

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:32.850
and we already did
this work in part

00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:35.770
b, where F now has a value of 3.

00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:39.390
And so what this is telling us,
because it's a linear equation,

00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:41.280
we can use
superposition principle,

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:52.550
the solution, if you were to
do the addition of these two

00:11:52.550 --> 00:12:01.520
equations, would just be the
sum of the previous solutions

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:02.620
that we found.

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:09.670
So this would be our x_3, if
I had labeled this with a 3.

00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:13.520
And so basically, the
solution is simply the sum

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:15.300
of the two previous forms.

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:19.424
And so we would end up
still with our c minus k*t,

00:12:19.424 --> 00:12:21.590
which is this basically the
homogeneous part that we

00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:23.950
obtained in the two previous
parts, which is common.

00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:29.390
And then we just need to
add each particular solution

00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:32.590
introduced in part a and part b.

00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:34.755
So if I have room I
will write it all out.

00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:47.990
So we would have k cos omega*t
plus omega sine omega*t from

00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:50.760
the first part of the cosine.

00:12:50.760 --> 00:13:05.200
And then we're introducing a
3k sine omega*t minus 3 omega

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:05.900
cosine omega*t.

00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:16.680
And that would be then the
solution of the combined two

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:17.860
equations.

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:20.180
And so you don't need to
redo the full work, by using

00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:22.000
the superposition principle.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.310
So here the key was just to
recognize that the cosines

00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:27.940
and the sines are basically
real parts and imaginary parts

00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:31.520
of the complex number, of
the exponential of i*omega*t.

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:33.580
Again, it's just Euler formula.

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:36.070
And using that as
a shortcut to be

00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:38.330
able to kill two
birds with one stone

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:42.320
and solve the two equations by
using only one approach, which

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:44.020
is just the integrating factor.

00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:46.930
And this ends the
session for today.
