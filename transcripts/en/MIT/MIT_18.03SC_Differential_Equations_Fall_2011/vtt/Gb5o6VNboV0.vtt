00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:02.990
The Damped Vibrations
applet illustrates

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:04.790
several different
concepts related

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:06.720
to differential equations.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.515
Initial conditions for
second-order equations,

00:00:09.515 --> 00:00:13.020
the phase plane for
autonomous equations,

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.070
and damping conditions
for second-order

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.240
homogeneous linear equations.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.102
The differential we're studying
appears at upper right.

00:00:22.102 --> 00:00:24.510
And the parameter
names reflect the fact

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.310
that this equation describes
a mass-spring-dashpot system,

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.960
with mass m, dashpot constant
b, and spring constant k.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.700
The right-hand side of
the equation is zero.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.440
There's no forcing term.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.410
The equation is homogeneous.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.960
The sliders at bottom
control the values

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.940
of the system parameters.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.550
With the selected
values for m, b, and k,

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.540
the solutions are
damped vibrations.

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:58.090
I can let the solution evolve
by grabbing the time slider

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:03.390
or by using the
animation key, which also

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.170
serves to stop the animation.

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.240
If the value of the
solution gets too small,

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.610
I can blow the picture
up using the zoom slider

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.250
at the upper left.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.990
Moving it to the right
squeezes the solutions.

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.020
Moving it to the left
makes them larger.

00:01:23.984 --> 00:01:28.330
The window on the left lets
you set the initial condition

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:29.870
of the system.

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.030
There are two components
to the initial condition

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.880
of a second-order equation.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:40.150
Position and velocity,
that is x and x dot.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:41.620
Together they form
the coordinates

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.120
of a point on this plane.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.740
I can grab the point
and change both x and x

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:48.620
prime simultaneously.

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.480
The x-coordinate is
written vertically,

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.370
because that's how it's written
on the right-hand graphing

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.870
window.

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.470
And you can see that they
keep pace with each other.

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.889
The horizontal component is
x dot, the initial velocity.

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:11.620
That's positive when
we're to the right,

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.340
and becomes negative
when we're to the left.

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.130
The left window
represents phase space.

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.730
For any time t, the
values of x and x dot

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.740
are the coordinates of
a point in phase space.

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.050
And as the solution
evolves through time,

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.530
that point follows
a path, sweeps out

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.250
a path in phase space.

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.500
And with these selected
choices of m, b, and k,

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.540
the path is a spiral.

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.620
This reflects the
fact that both x and x

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.101
dot undergo a damped vibration.

00:02:53.101 --> 00:02:56.710
The system parameters can
be set using these sliders

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:58.350
at lower left.

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:03.680
Let's suggest the mass to be
1/2 and leave k to be one,

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.550
and watch what happens
to the solutions

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.490
as we vary the
damping constant b.

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:13.560
When b is small, the solution
doesn't damp out as quickly,

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.420
and when b is large, it
damps out more quickly.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.390
These things become much clearer
when you think about them

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.220
in terms of the roots of the
characteristic polynomial

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.660
of this equation.

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.130
And we can display those roots
by clicking the roots button

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:31.340
here.

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.300
What's shown here
is the complex plane

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.735
with the roots of the
characteristic polynomial drawn

00:03:36.735 --> 00:03:37.860
on it.

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.440
Also we have a readout of the
two roots in green over here.

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.950
So let's watch what
happens when we adjust b.

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.930
I'm going to start
with b equal to zero.

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.880
In this case,
there's no damping.

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.010
The solutions are
sinusoidal, the roots

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.590
of the characteristic
polynomial are purely imaginary,

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.520
and the trajectory in
phase space is an ellipse.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:12.510
Both the solution and its
derivative vary sinusoidally.

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:20.120
As I increase b away
from zero, I get spirals.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:25.260
And at the same time, the roots
move off the imaginary axis.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:31.260
They acquire a negative real
part, which is minus b over 2m,

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.930
incidentally.

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:39.040
And as I increase b further,
the spiral opens up,

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.290
the damping occurs
more quickly, the roots

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:46.860
move away from the
imaginary axis.

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:52.560
They increase the size
of their real part.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.040
The damping occurs more quickly.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.180
And you'll notice that
they get closer and closer

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.460
to the real axis as well.

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.000
Their imaginary
part is decreasing.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.050
That means that the circular
frequency, the angular

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.470
frequency of the
solution, is decreasing.

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:12.060
The period, or pseudo-period
of the solution is decreasing.

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.600
You can see that in the
graph, but it's much clearer

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.030
to see what's happening
to these roots

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:18.840
of the characteristic
polynomial.

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.930
There are converging
on the real axis,

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:27.449
and eventually they merge into
a double root on the real axis.

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:28.490
This is critical damping.

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:40.380
From the readout, we
see that the value of b

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.120
seems to be about 1.41.

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.320
Why don't you take a
moment and calculate

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:49.830
what b is for these
values of m and k

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:51.435
when critical damping occurs?

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:59.940
If we continue to increase
b beyond critical damping,

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:04.400
now the roots move
out on the real axis.

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.440
There are two
exponential solutions,

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:12.450
and the general solution is
a linear combination of them.

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:16.350
And there's no oscillation
in any solution.
