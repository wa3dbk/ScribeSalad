00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.400
PROFESSOR: Welcome
to this recitation

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.380
on damped harmonic oscillators.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.160
So here you're asked to
assume an unforced, overdamped

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.640
spring-mass-dashpot that
started at x dot of 0

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.740
equals to 0, so rest,
and to show that it never

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.800
crosses the equilibrium
position, x equal to 0, for t

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.430
larger than 0.

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:25.940
The second part of
the problem asks

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.820
you to show that regardless
of the initial condition,

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.210
this overdamped
oscillator can not

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.110
cross the equilibrium position
more than one time, or more

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.280
than once.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.780
OK.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.617
So why don't you
pause the video,

00:00:39.617 --> 00:00:41.950
try to think about this
problem, and I'll be right back.

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:52.900
Welcome back.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.600
So the system that
we're looking at

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:04.700
is a spring-mass-dashpot
that would

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.990
be written in this form-- second
order differential equation.

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.430
Let's assume that we have
positive constant coefficients

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:13.190
here.

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.670
And basically, to
solve this, you

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:23.230
would be considering the
methods that we saw before.

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:27.540
And the general
solution would just

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.270
be written in the form of
c_1 exponential lambda_1,

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.379
the c_2 exponential lambda_2,
with c_1, c_2 just two

00:01:35.379 --> 00:01:36.795
constants that
would be determined

00:01:36.795 --> 00:01:38.120
by the initial condition.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.420
Lambda_1, lambda_2
would be here the roots

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.690
of the characteristic
polynomial that you

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.080
would have found there.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.980
Given that we're looking
at an overdamped, unforced

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.690
spring-mass-dashpot,
you can actually

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:58.740
show that lambda_1
and lambda_2 would

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.290
be both real and negative.

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.350
And here, we can just
say that basically,

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.150
lambda_1 and lambda_2
would be less than 1.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:18.010
And we'll keep that aside for
now, and I'll use this later.

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.440
So this is just
setting up the problem.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.870
So now, what was the question?

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.750
The question was to show that
if we start this system with

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:32.310
initial condition x
dot of 0 equal to 0,

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.890
which corresponds to
lambda_1*c_1 plus lambda_2*c_2

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.170
equals to 0, then the system
cannot cross the equilibrium

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.500
position x equal to 0
for t larger than 0.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.480
So let's just start by assuming
that the system crosses

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.550
the equilibrium position.

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:57.330
So for example, let's look for
t-star such that x of t-star

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:58.980
is equal to 0.

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.370
So x of t-star, we
know its form already.

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.040
We have the general
form of x of t-star.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.580
That's basically c_1 exponential
lambda_1*t-star plus c_2

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.690
exponential lambda_2*t-star.

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:18.060
And so we can massage
this equation,

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:23.240
and basically end up with
minus c_2 over c_1 equal

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:30.070
to exponential of lambda_1
minus lambda_2*t-star.

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.610
So now let's just
find our t-star

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.400
by applying the log of both
sides of this equation.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:44.790
So we get t-star equals to
the log of minus c_2 over c_1,

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:51.020
and we divide by the
lambda_1 minus lambda_2.

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:55.840
So here this tells us that if
t-star exists, which means,

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.820
if the log is defined, and
this minus c_2 over c_1

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:03.020
basically is positive, then we
only have one value of t-star

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.980
possible.

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.590
So here, we actually are
answering the second part

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.340
of this question,
number two, which

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.854
was telling us that regardless
of the initial condition-- so

00:04:10.854 --> 00:04:12.270
regardless of the
coefficient c_1,

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:15.220
c_2 that we would
have-- if t-star exists,

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:16.990
there is only one.

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:18.800
And so that means that
the system would not

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.019
cross this equilibrium
position more than once.

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:22.650
But I'll come back on that.

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.580
But now let's go back
to what we were asked

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.530
to do in the first part,
where we basically now go back

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:36.035
to our x dot of 0 equals to
0, which basically gave us

00:04:36.035 --> 00:04:41.550
that minus c_2 over c_1 is
equal to lambda_1 over lambda_2,

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.340
and the way we defined
lambda_1 over lambda_2

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:49.200
here gives us that minus
c_2 over c_1 is less than 1,

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.410
which means that the log
is going to be negative.

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.070
What happens in the denominator?

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:56.820
Lambda_1 minus lambda_2
would be positive.

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.560
So with this initial
condition, we

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:06.410
would end up with a t-star
that would be negative.

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:18.610
So basically, x is never equal
to 0 again for t larger than 0,

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.410
given these initial conditions.

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:23.760
So that finishes this
first part of the problem.

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.080
So I'll go back on the physics
of it in a moment with a graph.

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.360
So starting from this
initial condition,

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.210
x can never be equal to
0, because the only t-star

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:34.720
we can find would be negative.

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.770
So for t larger
than 0, it does not

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:38.520
cross the equilibrium point.

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.480
The second part of the
problem-- so this was one--

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:48.360
just comes from the fact
that, if I label this star,

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:57.190
star tells us that if minus
c_2 over c_1, strictly

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:06.290
larger than 0, then
only one t-star exists.

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:11.250
So if we have a solution,
there is only one.

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:13.450
And this is regardless
of the initial conditions

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:14.570
that we would be given.

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:17.420
So the system cannot cross the
equilibrium position more than

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:18.300
once.

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:22.755
So now let's look at what
we're doing here, graphically.

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:29.390
Let's assume that we're,
for example, starting

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:30.940
with initial
condition here, where

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:35.970
we're stretching our spring,
but we start with 0 velocity.

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:38.010
So x dot of 0 equal to 0.

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:39.810
That was the system that we had.

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:42.350
Then this is an overdamped
case where both basically

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:44.950
exponentials are
decaying to 0, and so we

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:49.315
would have a solution that
would go to 0 quickly.

00:06:49.315 --> 00:06:51.480
It would be damped.

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:54.989
And so this would be part 1.

00:06:54.989 --> 00:06:57.030
Now let's look at what
would happen if we started

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:58.620
with other initial conditions.

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:04.380
So for example, starting
from the same point

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:06.370
with a much bigger velocity.

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:12.370
Then the system would go up, but
eventually, it has to go down.

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:14.830
It wouldn't have this
shape, but basically, it

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:18.730
would have to go
down to 0's position.

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:21.820
And when it reaches,
you can show that again,

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:26.950
the derivative of x
can reach 0 only once.

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:29.912
And at that point, you're then
back to the initial conditions

00:07:29.912 --> 00:07:31.870
that you had in the first
part of the question,

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:34.640
and so you can then, from here,
argue again that you cannot

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:38.410
cross the zero, the
equilibrium point,

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:40.290
after reaching a maximum.

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:42.800
Now what if we
had a stretch that

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:49.300
would be giving a
negative velocity

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:52.680
to the mass, and a very
strong negative velocity?

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:58.910
Then the system also wants to go
back to 0, but could overshoot.

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:04.090
And the overshoot would
also generate a unique time

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:06.300
at which the derivative
would be equal to 0,

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:08.910
and after that point, you would
be back to the same argument

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:11.020
we had before,
where the solution

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:14.427
would have to go toward
0, but never crosses it.

00:08:14.427 --> 00:08:16.010
So we can have various
configurations.

00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:18.170
And here I start
with this point,

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:23.270
but you could also start with
other initial conditions, where

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:25.530
you could have,
as well, something

00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:32.760
that would be, for example,
a very strong positive,

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:36.130
where again, here you
would have an overshoot,

00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:39.730
but then the solution would be
attracted by the x equal to 0

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:42.220
solution.

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:44.740
And of course you could also
start from the equilibrium.

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:46.730
If you're not imposing
any initial velocity,

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:48.850
you just stay there,
because this is not forced.

00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:50.300
But if you're
imposing a velocity,

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:55.530
then you would have other
trajectories of the kind,

00:08:55.530 --> 00:09:04.520
for example, like this, where
again, it would go up, but then

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:06.730
be attracted back
by the 0 solution.

00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:09.510
So that's the typical behavior
for a damped oscillator, where

00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:11.100
basically there's
no oscillation,

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:13.850
but the solution is
attracted to rest.

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:15.860
And you could have
cases of overshoot.

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:21.230
Then you can show that
after the overshoot,

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:23.280
velocity would
reach 0, at maximum,

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:25.880
and then would be attracted
back to the zero solution

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:27.200
with never crossing it.

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.314
And that ends this recitation.
