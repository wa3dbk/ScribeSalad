00:00:05.796 --> 00:00:06.970
PROFESSOR: Hi everyone.

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:08.720
Welcome back.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.220
So today, we're
going to take a look

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:12.510
at first-order linear
differential equations

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.097
with constant coefficients.

00:00:14.097 --> 00:00:16.430
And specifically, we're going
to use integrating factors

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.220
to solve them.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.150
So the equation that we're going
to solve today is x dot plus

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.331
k*x equals 1.

00:00:23.331 --> 00:00:25.830
And then in part B we're going
to change the right-hand side

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.240
to e to the minus 5t.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.040
And then in part C, we're
asked to use the superposition

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.850
principle to solve x dot
plus k*x equals 4 plus 7 e

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.190
to the minus 5t.

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.300
So I'll let you think
about this for a moment,

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.591
and I'll come back in a second.

00:00:56.415 --> 00:00:57.490
Hi, everyone.

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:59.810
Welcome back.

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:04.420
So I should mention that every
first-order linear differential

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.010
equation, whether it has
constant coefficients or not,

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.570
can always be solved using
an integrating factor.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.820
However, in this case, we
have a constant coefficient,

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.145
which is particularly nice.

00:01:14.145 --> 00:01:15.520
And later on in
the course, we're

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.970
going to learn some even
better ways, or quicker ways,

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.600
to solve linear
differential equations

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.187
with constant coefficients.

00:01:22.187 --> 00:01:24.520
But for today, we're asked
to use an integrating factor.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:36.390
So for part A, we have the
equation x dot plus k*x equals

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.390
1.

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.970
And the first step is to
compute the integrating factor.

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:48.020
So the integrating factor,
which I'll call g of t,

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.970
it's always going
to be an exponential

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.130
of the integral of the function
that appears in front of x.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.200
So in this case, the
function is just a constant.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.750
It's k.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:10.860
So we have k*dt, which
gives us e to the k*t.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.820
So once we have the
integrating factor,

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.000
we just multiply our
equation through by g of t.

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:44.920
And by construction, what
the integrating factor does

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.899
is it lets us combine these
two terms on the left-hand side

00:02:47.899 --> 00:02:48.940
into an exact derivative.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.210
So these two terms are
actually the time derivative

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:04.256
of the product x times
the integrating factor e

00:03:04.256 --> 00:03:04.755
to the k*t.

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.819
And then on the right-hand
side we just have e to the k*t.

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:13.360
So we can just go
ahead and integrate

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.484
both sides of the equation.

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.660
And when we do that, the
right-hand side becomes

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:33.892
the integral of k*t, which
is 1 over k e to the k*t plus

00:03:33.892 --> 00:03:34.975
a constant of integration.

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.140
And now, just to isolate x,
I could divide through by e

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.650
to the k*t.

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:57.070
And I obtain 1 over k plus a
constant e to the minus k*t.

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.770
So here's the
solution to the ODE.

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.620
OK, so this concludes part A.

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:19.500
For part B, we have the
equation x dot plus k*x equals e

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.000
to the negative 5t.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.820
So if we take a look
at this equation,

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.257
the only thing that we've
changed is the right-hand side.

00:04:26.257 --> 00:04:27.840
We haven't changed
the left-hand side.

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.207
And again, if we compute
the integrating factor,

00:04:34.207 --> 00:04:36.790
well, we know that it's the same
integrating factor as in part

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:42.740
A. And the reason is that
the integrating factor only

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.010
depends on the left-hand side.

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:45.510
It only depends on
the linear terms.

00:04:49.642 --> 00:04:51.350
So I can multiply the
equation through by

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:52.660
the integrating factor again.

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:03.840
And when I do this, I'll
just combine the terms

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.260
on the right-hand side.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.385
So this is e to the k*t
times e to the minus 5t.

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:19.670
And again, by construction, the
left-hand side is going to be

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:26.470
the same as in part A, the time
derivative of x times e to k*t.

00:05:34.614 --> 00:05:36.655
And now we can go ahead
and integrate both sides.

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.370
OK, so if we integrate
this, we end up

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:58.850
getting 1 over k
minus 5, e to the k

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:02.870
minus 5t, plus a constant c.

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:10.920
And if we step back and take
a look at this for a second,

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:14.290
we see that when k equals
5, we have a problem.

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:17.220
Particularly, the
denominator vanishes,

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:20.560
which would give us 1 over 0.

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.230
So this equation,
this right-hand side,

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:27.030
actually only holds when
k is not equal to 5.

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:29.380
So this is only valid
for k not equal to five.

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.270
So the question is, what
happens when k equals to five?

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:53.000
And in this case, we
would have x e to the k*t,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:59.600
times the integral of 1 dt,
which would just give us t plus

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:00.410
a constant c.

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:14.920
So in this case, we would
have t e to the minus k*t,

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:18.950
plus c e to the minus k*t.

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:20.540
And this is when
k is equal to 5.

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:30.870
Meanwhile, for k not
equal to 5, well, we

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:32.720
have the solution
worked out already.

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:40.055
So we can just isolate x, and
divide through by e to the k*t.

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:52.566
And we have 1 over k minus
5, e to the minus 5t, plus c,

00:07:52.566 --> 00:07:53.954
e to the minus k*t.

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:05.310
And this concludes part B.

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:11.580
So the solution for k equal
to 5 is t, e to the minus k*t,

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:13.920
which would be e
to the minus 5t,

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:19.560
plus a constant c times
e to the minus 5t.

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:22.770
And when k is not equal to
5, we have 1 over k minus 5,

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:26.720
e to the minus 5t, plus
c e to the minus k*t.

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:29.580
So I'd just like to point
out a few things between

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:33.480
the solutions for part A
and for part B. First off,

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:39.100
we note that both part A and
part B share a common solution

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:43.539
of the form constant c
times e to the minus k*t.

00:08:43.539 --> 00:08:46.720
So this is a term that appears
in the solution for both part A

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:49.760
and for part B.
The reason is this

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:52.060
can be thought of as
the homogeneous solution

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:53.890
to the differential equation.

00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:56.400
This is the term that solves
the differential equation when

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:57.860
the right-hand side is set to 0.

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:06.610
Secondly, in part B, if we
take a look, when k is not

00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:10.590
equal to 5, we have the term
which is a constant times

00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:12.560
e to the minus 5t.

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:22.500
However, when we have k
equal to 5, what happens

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:26.620
is we have a term which
essentially occurs

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:29.760
from forcing the differential
equation on resonance,

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:35.070
which gives us an extra factor
of t times e to the minus 5t.

00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:38.450
And we'll see more about
resonance in the future.

00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:43.035
OK, so for part C, we're
asked to use superposition.

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:57.500
To solve the differential
equation x dot plus k*x equals

00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:01.615
4 plus 7 e to the minus 5t.

00:10:04.354 --> 00:10:06.520
Now if we take a look at
this differential equation,

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:09.700
we already know the solution
when the right-hand side is 1

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:13.184
and when the right-hand
side is e to the minus 5t.

00:10:13.184 --> 00:10:14.850
So we've changed the
right-hand side now

00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:20.490
so it's 4 times 1 plus 7
times e to the minus 5t.

00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:22.700
So what's the total
solution going to be?

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:26.230
Well, it's going to be four
times our solution when

00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:31.180
the right-hand side was 1,
plus seven times the solution

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:33.725
when the right-hand side
was e to the minus 5t.

00:10:33.725 --> 00:10:36.430
This is one of the beautiful
things about linear equations.

00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:39.830
When we add two forcings
to the right-hand side,

00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:41.680
our total solution
is just going to be

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:43.880
the sum of the solutions
to the individual terms.

00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:48.520
OK.

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:52.590
So what this means
is our solution, x,

00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:56.780
is going to be 4
times the solution

00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:59.010
when the right-hand side was 1.

00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:09.850
And in that case, it was 1 over
k plus c e to the minus k*t,

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:16.230
plus 7 times the solution
when the right-hand side was e

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:19.100
to the minus 5t.

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:23.940
And when k was not equal to 5,
this becomes 1 over k minus 5,

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:28.700
e to the minus 5t, plus
c e to the minus kt.

00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:36.720
So if we take a look at
the sum of these two terms,

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:40.330
I'll denote the two
constants as c_1 and c_2.

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:45.480
We actually have 4 times
c_1 plus 7 times c_2.

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:48.920
That's just going to give
us a new constant, c_3.

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:58.861
So in general, this becomes 4
over k plus 1 over k minus 5,

00:11:58.861 --> 00:12:10.760
e to the minus 5t, plus a
constant c e to the minus k*t.

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:14.770
So I can just recombine
the 4c e to the minus k*t,

00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:17.620
and the 7c e to the minus k*t.

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:20.250
That together just gives
me a new constant, c_3,

00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:22.670
times e to the minus k*t.

00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:26.790
And this is the solution
when k is not equal to 5.

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:31.280
When k equals to 5, what we do
is we just replace this term

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:34.720
with t e to the minus k*t.

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:38.285
So this is when k
is not equal to 5.

00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:45.350
It should be a 7 here.

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:52.270
So I'll just conclude there.

00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:54.540
And for summary,
we've taken a look

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:57.070
at a first-order
linear differential

00:12:57.070 --> 00:12:59.550
equation with a couple
different right-hand sides.

00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:02.347
We've solved them using
an integrating factor.

00:13:02.347 --> 00:13:04.680
And then what we've done is
we've used the superposition

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:08.700
principle to solve the same
ODE for a right-hand side which

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:12.010
is the superposition of
multiples of the functions

00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:15.320
that we've had in
part A and for part B.

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:18.940
So I'd like to conclude here,
and I'll see you next time.
