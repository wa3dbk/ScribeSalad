00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I just want to remind you of
the main facts.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
The first thing that you have
to do is, of course,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
we are going to have to be
doing it several times today.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
That is the system we are
trying to solve.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And the first thing you have to
do is find a characteristic

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
equation which is general form,
although this is not the form

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
you should use for two-by-two,
is A minus lambda I

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
equals zero.
And its roots are the

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
eigenvalues.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And then with each eigenvalue
you then have to calculate its

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
eigenvector, which you do by
solving the system (A minus

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
lambda1, let's say,
times I) alpha equals zero

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
because
the solution is the eigenvector

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
alpha 1.
And then the final solution

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
that you make out of the two of
them looks like alpha 1 times e

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000
to the lambda 1t.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Of course you do that for each
eigenvalue.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000
You get the associated
eigenvector.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
And then the general solution
is made up out of a linear

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000
combination of these individual
guys with constant coefficients.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.000
The lecture today is devoted to
the two cases where things do

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000
not go as smoothly as they seem
to in the homework problems you

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000
have been doing up until now.
The first one will take

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000
probably most of the period.
It deals with what happens when

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000
an eigenvalue gets repeated.
But I think since the situation

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000
is a little more complicated
than it is where the case of a

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000
characteristic root gets
repeated in the case of a

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000
second-order equation as we saw
it, you know what to do in that

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000
case, here there are different
possibilities.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.000
And I thought the best thing to
do would be to illustrate them

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000
on an example.
So here is a problem.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.000
It came out of a mild
nightmare, but I won't bore you

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.000
with the details.
Anyway, we have this circular

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.000
fish tank.
It is a very modern fish tank.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.000
It is divided into three
compartments because one holds

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Siamese fighting fish and one
goldfish, and one-- They should

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.000
not eat each other.
And it is going to be a simple

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.000
temperature problem.
The three actual compartments

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000
have to be kept at different
temperatures because one is for

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000
tropical fish and one is for
arctic fish and one is for

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.000
everyday garden variety fish.
But the guy forgets to turn on

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.000
the heater so the temperatures
start out what they are supposed

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.000
to be, tropical,
icy, and normal.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.000
But as the day wears on,
of course, the three

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.000
compartments trade their heat
and sort of tend to all end up

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.000
at the same temperature.
So we are going to let (x)i

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.000
equal the temperature in tank i.
Now, these are separated from

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.000
each other by glass things.
Everything is identical,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.000
each has the same volume,
and the same glass partition

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.000
separates them out and no heat
can escape.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.000
This is very well-insulated
with very double-thick

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Thermopane glass or something
like that.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.000
You can see in,
but heat cannot get out very

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.000
well.
Heat essentially is conducted

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.000
from one of these cells to the
other.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.000
And let's assume that the water
in each tank is kept stirred up

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.000
because the fish are swimming
around in it.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.000
That should be a pretty decent
way of stirring a fish tank.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.000
The question is how do each of
these, as a function of time,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.000
and I want to know how they
behave over time,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.000
so find these functions.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Well, we are going to find them
in solutions to differential

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.000
equations.
And the differential equations

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.000
are not hard to set up.
They are very much like the

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.000
diffusion equation you had for
homework or the equations we

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.000
studied in the beginning of the
term.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Let's do one carefully because
the others go exactly the same

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.000
way.
What determines the flow,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.000
the change in temperature?
Well, it is the conductivity

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.000
across the barriers.
But there are two barriers

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.000
because heat can flow into this
first cell, both from this guy

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:16.000
and it can flow across this
glass pane from the other cell.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.000
We have to take account of both
of those possibilities.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.000
It is like in your homework.
The little diffusion cell that

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.000
was in the middle could get
contributions from both sides,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.000
whereas, the two guys on the
end could only get contribution

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:35.000
from one.
But here, nobody is on the end.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:40.000
It is circular table.
Everyone is dying equally.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Everybody can get input from
the other two cells.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.000
x1 prime is some
constant of conductivity times

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.000
the temperature difference
between tank three and tank one.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.000
And then there is another term
which comes from tank two.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:07.000
So a times tank two minus the
temperature difference,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:10.000
tank two minus tank one.
Let's write this out.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Remember there will be other
equations, too.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:16.000
But instead of doing this,
let's do a more careful job

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.000
with this first equation.
When I write it out,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.000
remember, the important thing
is you are going to have x1,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:27.000
x2, x3 down the left,
so they have to occur in the

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:30.000
same order on the right in order
to use these standard eigenvalue

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:35.000
techniques.
The coefficient of x1 is going

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:39.000
to be minus a x1 and then
another minus a x1.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:44.000
In other words,
it is going to be minus 2 ax1.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:48.000
And then the x2 term will be
plus a x2.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:52.000
And the x3 term will be plus a
x3.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Well, you can see now that is
the equation for x1 prime in

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:01.000
terms of the other variables.
But there is symmetry.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:06.000
There is no difference between
this tank, that tank,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:10.000
and that tank as far as the
differential equations are

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:14.000
concerned.
And, therefore,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:16.000
I can get the equations for the
other two tanks by just changing

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:21.000
1 to 2, just switching the
subscripts.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:24.000
When I finally do it all,
the equations are going to be,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:28.000
I will write them first out as
a system.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Let's take a equal 1
because I am going to want to

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:36.000
solve them numerically,
and I want you to be able to

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:40.000
concentrate on what is
important, what is new now and

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:43.000
not fuss because I don't want to
have an extra a floating around

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:48.000
everywhere just contributing
nothing but a mild confusion to

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:51.000
the proceedings.
So x1 prime,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:53.000
I am going to take a equal 1
and simply write it minus 2 x1

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:57.000
plus x2 plus x3.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:00.000
And so now what would the
equation for x2 prime

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:03.000
be?
Well, here x2 plays the role

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:07.000
that x1 played before.
And the only way to tell that

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:11.000
x1 was the main guy here was it
occurred with a coefficient

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:16.000
negative 2, whereas,
the other guys occurred with

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:20.000
coefficient 1.
That must be what happens here,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:24.000
too.
Since x2 prime is our

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:27.000
main man, this is minus x2 and
this must be x1 here plus x3.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:32.000
And finally the last one is no
different, x3 prime is x1 plus

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:37.000
x2.
And now it is the x3 that

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:41.000
should get negative 2 for the
coefficient.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:44.000
There is a perfectly
reasonable-looking set of

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:48.000
equations.
Just how reasonable they are

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:51.000
depends upon what their
characteristic polynomial turns

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:55.000
out to be.
And all the work in these

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:58.000
problems is trying to find nice
models where you won't have to

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:03.000
use Matlab to calculate the
roots, the eigenvalues,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:07.000
the roots of the characteristic
polynomial.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:12.000
So we have to now find the
characteristic polynomial.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:15.000
The matrix that we are talking
about is the matrix,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:19.000
well, let's right away write A
minus lambda I

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:23.000
I cannot use the trace and

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:25.000
determinant form for this
equation because it is not a

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:29.000
two-by-two matrix.
It is a three-by-three matrix.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:32.000
I have to use the original form
for the characteristic equation.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:38.000
But what is this going to be?
Well, what is A?

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:41.000
A is minus 2.
I am going to leave a little

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:44.000
space here.
1, 1, 1 minus 2,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:47.000
1.
And finally 1,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:48.000
1, negative 2.
subtract lambda from

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:54.000
the main diagonal,
minus 2 minus lambda

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:58.000
minus 2 minus lambda,
minus 2 minus lambda.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:02.000
And now that equals zero is the
characteristic equation.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:08.000
The term with the most lambdas
in it is the main diagonal.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:12.000
That is always true,
notice.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Now, each of these I would be
happier writing lambda plus 2,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:18.000
so there would be a negative
sign, negative sign,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:22.000
negative sign.
The product of three negative

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:25.000
signs is still a negative sign
because three is an odd number.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:30.000
So it is minus the principle
term.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:34.000
The product of these three is
minus lambda plus 2 cubed.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:38.000
Now, the rest of the terms are

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:42.000
going to be easy.
There is another term 1 times 1

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:46.000
times 1, another term 1 times 1
times 1.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:49.000
So to that I add 2,
1 and 1 for those two other

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:53.000
terms.
And now I have the three going

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:55.000
in this direction,
but each one of them has to be

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:59.000
prefaced with a minus sign.
What does each one of them come

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:04.000
to?
Well, this is minus 2 minus

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:07.000
lambda when I multiply those
three numbers together.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:11.000
And so are the other guys.
This is 1 times 1 times minus 2

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:15.000
minus lambda,
the same thing.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:17.000
There are three of them.
Minus because they are going

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:21.000
this way, minus 3 because there
are three of them,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:24.000
and what each one of them is is
negative 2 negative lambda.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:28.000
That is equal to zero,
and that is the characteristic

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:32.000
equation.
Now, it doesn't look very

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:35.000
promising.
On the other hand,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:37.000
I have selected it for the
lecture.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:39.000
Simple psychology should tell
you that it is going to come out

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:43.000
okay.
What I am going to do is expand

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:45.000
this.
First imagine changing the

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:47.000
sign.
I hate to have a minus sign in

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:50.000
front of a lambda cubed,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:52.000
so let's make this plus and we
will make this minus and we will

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:56.000
make this plus.
I will just change all the

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:58.000
signs, which is okay since it is
an equation equals zero.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:02.000
That doesn't change its roots
any.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:06.000
And now we are going to expand
it out.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:08.000
What is this?
Lambda plus 2 cubed.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:11.000
Lambda cubed plus,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:12.000
and don't get confused because
it is this 2 that will kill you

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:16.000
when you use the binomial
theorem.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:18.000
If there is 1 here everybody
knows what to do.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:21.000
If there is an A there
everybody knows what to do.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:24.000
It is when that is a number not
1 that everybody makes mistakes,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:28.000
including me.
The binomial coefficients are

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:31.000
1, 3, 3, 1 because it is a
cubed, I am expanding.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:36.000
So it is lambda cubed plus 3
times lambda squared times 2.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:40.000
I won't explain to you what I
am doing.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:43.000
I will just do it and hope that
you all know what I am doing.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:47.000
Plus 3 times lambda times 2
squared plus the last term,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:51.000
which is 2 cubed.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:55.000
And now we have the other term.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:59.000
All that is plus because I
changed its sign.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:02.000
The next thing is negative 2.
And then the last thing is plus

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:09.000
3 times (minus 2 minus lambda).

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:14.000
Let's keep it.
So what is the actual

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:17.000
characteristic equation?
Maybe I can finish it.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:21.000
I should stay over here instead
of recopying all of it.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:33.000
Well, there is a lot more work
to do.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:35.000
Let's see if we can at least
write down the equation.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:39.000
What is it?
It is lambda cubed.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:41.000
What is the lambda squared

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:44.000
erm?
It is six and that is all there

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:48.000
is.
How about the lambda term?

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:50.000
Well, we have 12 lambda minus 3
lambda which makes plus 9

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:54.000
lambda.
That looks good but constant

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:57.000
terms have a way of screwing
everything up.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:00.000
What is the constant term?
It is A minus 2 minus 6.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:06.000
Zero.
The constant term is zero.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:08.000
That converts this from a hard
problem to an easy problem.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Now it is a cinch to calculate
the stuff.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:17.000
Let's go to this board and
continue the work over here.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:30.000
The equation is lambda cubed
plus 6 lambda squared plus 9

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:33.000
lambda is zero.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:37.000
It is very easy to calculate
the roots of that.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:40.000
You factor it.
Lambda is a common factor.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:43.000
And what is left?
Lambda squared plus 6 lambda

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:46.000
plus 9.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:49.000
That is the sort of thing you
got all the time when you were

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:53.000
studying critical damping.
It is the square of lambda plus

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:57.000
3. Lambda squared plus 6 lambda

00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:00.000
plus 9 equals zero.
So the eigenvalues,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:04.000
the roots are what?
Well, they are lambda equals

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:08.000
zero from this factor and then
lambda equals minus 3.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:13.000
But what is new is that the

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:16.000
minus 3 is a double root.
That is a double root.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:20.000
Now, that, of course,
is what is going to cause the

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:24.000
trouble.
Because, for each one of these,

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:27.000
I am supposed to calculate the
eigenvector and make up the

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:32.000
solution.
But that assumed that I had

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:35.000
three things to get three
different solutions.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:38.000
Here I have only got two
things.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:40.000
It is the same trouble we ran
into when there was a repeated

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:44.000
root.
We were studying second or

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:46.000
third order differential
equations and the characteristic

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:49.000
equation had a repeated root.
And I had to go into a song and

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:53.000
dance and stand on my head and
multiply things by t and so on.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:57.000
And then talk very hard arguing
why that was a good thing to do

00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:00.000
to get the answer.
Now, I am not going to do the

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:03.000
same thing here.
Instead, I am going to try to

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:08.000
solve the problem instead.
Let's get two points by at

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:12.000
least doing the easy part of it.
Lambda equals zero.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:17.000
What am I supposed to do with

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:19.000
lambda equals zero?
I am looking for the alpha that

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:23.000
goes with that.
And I find that eigenvector by

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:27.000
solving this system of
equations.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:30.000
Let's write out what that
system of equations is.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:35.000
Well, if lambda is zero,
this isn't there.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:38.000
It is just the matrix A times
alpha equals zero.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:44.000
And the matrix A is,

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:46.000
I never even wrote it anywhere.
I never wrote A.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:51.000
I thought I would get away
without having to do it,

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:55.000
but you never get away with
anything.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:59.000
It's the principle of life.
That is A.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:04.000
If I subtract zero from the
main diagonal,

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:07.000
that doesn't do a great deal to
A.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:10.000
And the resulting system of
equations is those same things,

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:16.000
except you have the a1's there,
too.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:19.000
There is one.
a1 minus 2 a2 plus a3 equals

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:23.000
zero.
I am just subtracting zero from

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:28.000
the main diagonal so there is
nothing to do.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:32.000
a2 minus 2 a3 equals zero.
Now I am supposed to solve

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:39.000
those.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:46.000
Of course we could do it.
Well, how do you know how to

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:49.000
solve a system of three linear
equations?

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:51.000
Well, elimination.
You can always solve by

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:54.000
elimination.
Now we are much more

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:56.000
sophisticated than that.
You all have pocket calculators

00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:00.000
so you could use the inverse
matrix, right?

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:02.000
No.
You cannot use the inverse

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:04.000
matrix.
What will happen if you punch

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:09.000
in those coefficients and then
punch in A inverse.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:14.000
What answer will it give you?
0, 0, 0.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:18.000
No, I am sorry.
It won't give you any answer.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:22.000
What will it say?
It will say I cannot calculate

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:27.000
the inverse to that matrix
because the whole purpose of

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:33.000
this exercise was to find a
value of lambda such that this

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:39.000
system of equations is
dependent.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:44.000
The coefficient determinant is
zero and, therefore,

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:48.000
the coefficient matrix does not
have an inverse matrix.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:52.000
You cannot use that method.
In other words,

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:55.000
the inverse matrix will never
work in these problems because

00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:00.000
the system of equations you will
be trying to solve is always a

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:05.000
non-independent system.
And, therefore,

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:09.000
its determinant is always zero.
And, therefore,

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:12.000
there is no inverse matrix
because the determinant of the

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:17.000
coefficient is zero.
All you can do is use

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:20.000
elimination or physical insight
and common sense.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:24.000
Now, because I teach
differential equations everybody

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:29.000
assumes, mistakenly,
as I think, that I really know

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:33.000
something about them.
I get now and then graduate

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:38.000
students, not in mathematics,
but some obscure field of

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:42.000
engineering or whatever drift
into my office and say I see you

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:46.000
teach differential equations.
Do you have a minute here?

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:51.000
And before I can say no they
write their differential

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:55.000
equation on the board.
And almost invariably it is

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:58.000
nothing I have ever seen before.
And they so look at me

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:03.000
hopefully and expectantly.
So what do I ask them?

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:07.000
I don't ask them what they have
tried.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:11.000
What I ask them is where did
this come from?

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:14.000
What field did it come from?
Because each field has its own

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:20.000
little tricks.
It gets the same differential

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:23.000
equations all the time and has
its own little tricks for

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:28.000
solving them.
You should do the same thing

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:32.000
here.
Well, of course we can solve

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:35.000
this.
And by now most of you have

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:39.000
solved it just by inspection,
just by sort of psyching out

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:43.000
the answer.
But a better way is to say

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:46.000
look, suppose we had the
solution, what would the

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:50.000
solution look like?
Well, it would look like (a1,

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:54.000
a2, a3), whatever the values of
those variables were which gave

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:58.000
me the solution to the equation,
times e to the 0t.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:03.000
But what is this?
e to the 0t is one

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:08.000
for all time.
And, therefore,

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:10.000
this is a constant solution.
What I am asking is to find a

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:15.000
constant solution.
Now, can I, by inspection,

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:19.000
find a constant solution to
this?

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:21.000
If so it must be the one.
Well, there is an obvious

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:25.000
constant solution.
All the cells have the same

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:29.000
temperature.
If that is true then there is

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:32.000
no reason why it should ever
change as time goes on.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:38.000
The physical problem itself
suggests what the answer must

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:41.000
be.
You don't have to solve

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:43.000
equations.
In other words,

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:44.000
any constant like (1,
1, 1).

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:46.000
Well, could it be (20,
20, 20)?

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:48.000
Yeah, that is a constant
multiple of (1,

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:50.000
1, 1).
That is included.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:51.000
My basic constant solution,
therefore, is simply (1,

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:54.000
1, 1) times e to the 0t.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:57.000
You don't have to include e to
the 0t because it is one.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:00.000
Now, just to check,
is (1, 1, 1) a solution to

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:03.000
these equations?
It certainly is.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:07.000
1 plus 1 minus 2 is zero in
every case.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:10.000
The equations are essentially
the same, except they use

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:14.000
different variables.
By inspection or,

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:17.000
if you like,
by elimination,

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:20.000
but not by finding the inverse
matrix you solve those

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:24.000
equations.
And we have our first solution.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:27.000
Now let's go onto the second
one.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:30.000
For the second one,
we are going to have to use the

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:34.000
eigenvalue lambda equals
negative 3.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:39.000
And now what is the system of
equations?

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:42.000
Well, now I have to take this
and I have to subtract negative

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:47.000
3 from the diagonal elements.
Minus 2 minus negative 3 is

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:52.000
plus 1, right?

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:55.000
Got that?
Each of the diagonal elements,

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:59.000
after I subtract minus 3 turns
into plus 1.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:04.000
And, therefore,
the system becomes,

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:06.000
the system I have to solve is
a1 plus a2 plus a3 equals zero.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:11.000
And what is the second

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:15.000
equation?
Symmetry is preserved.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:17.000
All the equations are
essentially the same,

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:20.000
except for the names of the
variables so they all must give

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:25.000
you the same thing after I
subtract minus 3 from the main

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:30.000
diagonal.
Well, that is what we call a

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:33.000
dependent system of equations.
All I have is the same equation

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:40.000
repeated twice,
but I still have to solve it.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:44.000
Now, what you see is that there
are lots of solutions to this.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:50.000
Let me write down one of them.
For example,

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:55.000
suppose I made a1 equal to 1
and I made a2 a 0,

00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:00.000
then a3 would be negative 1.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:06.000
So here is a solution.
That is the eigenvector.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:09.000
And with it,
I can make the solution by

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:12.000
multiplying by e to the negative
3t.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:16.000
There is a solution.
But that is not the only alpha

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:20.000
I could have chosen.
Suppose I chose this one

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:24.000
instead.
Suppose I kept this 1,

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:26.000
but this time made a3 zero.
Well, in that case,

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:30.000
there would be a2 that had to
be minus 1.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:36.000
Now, is this essentially
different from that one?

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:38.000
It would still be multiplied by
e to the minus 3t,

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:42.000
but don't be fooled by the e to
the minus 3t.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:45.000
That is our scalar.
That is not what is essential.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:48.000
What is essential is the
content of these two vectors.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:51.000
Is either one a multiple of the
other?

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:53.000
The answer is no.
Therefore, they are

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:55.000
independent.
They are pointing in two

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:57.000
different directions in three
space, these two vectors.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:02.000
And, therefore,
I have two independent

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:05.000
solutions just by picking two
different vectors that solve

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:09.000
those three equations.
This is also a solution.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:13.000
If I call this the eigenvector
alpha 1, then I ought to call

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:18.000
this one the alpha 2.
Hey, we can keep on going

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:22.000
through this.
Why not make the first one

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:25.000
zero?
Well, what would happen if I

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:27.000
made the first one 0,
and then 1, and minus 1?

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:31.000
The answer is this one is no
longer independent of those two.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:38.000
I can get it by taking a
combination of those two.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:40.000
Do you see what combination I
should take?

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:48.000
This one minus that one.
This guy minus that guy gives

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:53.000
me that guy, isn't that right?
1 minus 1, 0 minus minus 1,

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:58.000
minus 1 minus 0.
This is not a new one.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:02.000
It looks new,
but it is not.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:06.000
I can get it by taking a linear
combination of these two.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:10.000
It is not independent delta.
And that would be true for any

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:14.000
other possible solution you
could get for these equations.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:18.000
Once you found two solutions,
all the others will be linear

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:22.000
combinations of them.
Well, I cannot use that one.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:26.000
It is not new.
And the general solution,

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:29.000
therefore, will be a
combination, c1 times that one

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:32.000
plus a constant times this one.
Plus the first one that I found

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:38.000
c3 times (1, 1,
1) e to the 0t,

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:42.000
which I don't have to write in.
That is the general solution to

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:48.000
the system, (x1,x2, x3).

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:51.000
What happens as time goes to
infinity?

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:54.000
Regardless of what the values
of these two C's this term goes

00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:00.000
to zero, that term goes to zero
and what I am left with is a

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:06.000
constant solution.
So all of these solutions tend

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:12.000
to be the solution where all the
cells are at the same

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:17.000
temperature.
Well, of course there must be

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:21.000
some vocabulary word in this.
There is.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:25.000
There are two vocabulary words.
This is a good eigenvalue.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:31.000
There are also bad eigenvalues.
This is a good repeated

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:38.000
eigenvalue, but good is not the
official word.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:43.000
An eigenvalue like this,
which is repeated but where you

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:50.000
can find enough eigenvectors,
if lambda is a repeated

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:56.000
eigenvalue, it occurs multiply
in the characteristic polynomial

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:03.000
as a root.
But you can find enough

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:09.000
independent eigenvectors --
Forget the "but."

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:36.000
-- to make up the needed number
of independent solutions.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:42.000
For example,
if it is repeated once,

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:46.000
that is it occurs doubly then
somehow I have got to get two

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:52.000
solutions out of that as I was
able to here.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:57.000
If it occurred triply,
I have got to get three

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:02.000
solutions out of it.
I would look for three

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:08.000
independent eigenvectors and
hope I could find them.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:12.000
That is the good case because
it tells you how to make up as

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:18.000
many solutions as you need.
And this kind of eigenvalue is

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:23.000
called in the literature the
complete eigenvalue.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:36.000
Now, how about the kind in
which you cannot?

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:39.000
Well, unfortunately,
all my life I have called it

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:43.000
incomplete, which seems to be a
perfectly reasonable thing to

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:49.000
call it.
However, terminology changes

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:52.000
slowly over time.
The notes, because I wrote

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:56.000
them, call it an incomplete
eigenvalue.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:59.000
But the accepted term nowadays
is defective.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:03.000
I don't like that.
It violates the "eigenvalues

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:08.000
with disabilities act" or
something.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:12.000
But I have to give it to you
because that is the word I am

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:17.000
going to try to use from now on,
at least if I remember to use

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:24.000
it.
It would be the word,

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:26.000
for example,
used in the linear algebra

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:30.000
course 18.06 "plug,
plug," defective otherwise.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:36.000
A defective eigenvalue is one
where you can get one

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:39.000
eigenvector.
If it is double,

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:40.000
for example,
if it a double eigenvalue.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:43.000
It is defective if you can get
one eigenvector that goes with

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:47.000
it, but you cannot find an
independent one.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:49.000
The only other ones you can
find are multiples of the first

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:53.000
one.
Then you are really in trouble

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:55.000
because you just don't have
enough solutions that you are

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:59.000
supposed to get out of that,
and you have to do something.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:04.000
What you do is turn to problem
two on your problem set and

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:07.000
solve it because that tells you
what to do.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:10.000
And I even give you an example
to work.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:12.000
Problem two,
that little matrix has a

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:15.000
defective eigenvalue.
It doesn't look defective,

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:18.000
but you cannot tell.
It is defective.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:20.000
But you, nonetheless,
will be able to find two

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:23.000
solutions because you will be
following instructions.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:38.000
Now, the only other thing I
should tell you is one of the

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:41.000
most important theorems in
linear algebra,

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:43.000
which is totally beyond the
scope of this course and is

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:47.000
beyond the scope of most
elementary linear algebra

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:50.000
courses as I have taught around
the country but,

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:53.000
of course, not at MIT.
But, nonetheless,

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:55.000
it is the last theorem in the
course.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:57.000
That means it is liable to use
stuff.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:59.000
The theorem goes by different
names.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:01.000
Sometimes it is called the
principle axis theorem.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:06.000
Sometimes it is called the
spectral theorem.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:10.000
But, anyway,
what it says is,

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:12.000
if A is a real end-by-end
matrix which is symmetric,

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:17.000
you know what a symmetric
matrix is?

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:21.000
The formal definition is it is
equal to its transpose.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:26.000
What that means is if you flip
it around the main diagonal it

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:31.000
looks just the same as before.
Somewhere on this board,

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:38.000
right there,
in fact, is a symmetric matrix.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:42.000
What happened to it?
Right here was the symmetric

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:46.000
matrix.
I erased the one thing which I

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:50.000
had to have.
Minus 2, 1, 1;

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:52.000
1, minus 2, 1;
1, 1 minus 2.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:57.000
That was our matrix A.
The matrix is symmetric because

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:03.000
if I flip it around the diagonal
it looks the same as it did

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:08.000
before.
Well, not exactly.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:12.000
The ones are sort of lying on
their side, but you have to take

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:16.000
account of that.
Is that right?

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:18.000
The twos are backward.
Well, you know what I mean.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:21.000
Put that element there,
this one here,

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:24.000
that one there.
Exchange these two.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:26.000
Notice the diagonal elements
don't all have to be minus 2 for

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:30.000
that.
No matter what they were,

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:32.000
they are the guys that aren't
moved when you do the flipping.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:38.000
Therefore, there is no
condition on them.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:40.000
It is these other guys.
Each guy here has to use the

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:44.000
same guy there.
This one has to be the same as

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:48.000
that one, and so on.
Then it will be real and

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:51.000
symmetric.
If you have a matrix that is

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:54.000
real and symmetric,
like the one we have been

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:57.000
working with,
the theorem is that all its

00:33:54.000 --> 00:34:00.000
eigenvalues are complete.
That is a very unobvious

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:04.000
theorem.
All its eigenvalues are

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:08.000
automatically complete.
And it is a remarkable fact

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:13.000
that you can prove that purely
generally with a certain amount

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:20.000
of pure reasoning no calculation
at all.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:24.000
But it has to be true,
and it is true.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:28.000
You will find there are whole
branches of applied differential

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:34.000
equations.
You know, equilibrium theory,

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:39.000
all the matrices that you deal
with are always symmetric.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:43.000
And, therefore,
this repeated eigenvalues is

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:46.000
not something you have to worry
about, finding extra solutions.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:51.000
Well, I guess that is the end
of the first part of the

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:55.000
lecture.
I have a third of it left.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:58.000
Let's talk fast.
I would like to,

00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:01.000
with the remaining time,
explain to you what to do if

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:05.000
you were to get complex
eigenvalues.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:14.000
Now, actually,
the answer is follow the same

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:17.000
program.
In other words,

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:18.000
if you solve the characteristic
equation and you get a complex

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:23.000
root, follow the program,
calculate the corresponding

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:26.000
complex eigenvectors.
In other words,

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:29.000
solve the equations.
Everything will be the same

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:32.000
except that the eigenvectors
will turn out to be complex,

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:36.000
that is will have complex
entries.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:40.000
Don't worry about it.
Then form the solutions.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:43.000
The solutions are now going to
look once again like alpha times

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:49.000
e to the a plus bi to the t.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:53.000
This will be complex and that
will be complex,

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:57.000
too.
This will have complex entries.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:36:00.000
And then, finally,
take the real and imaginary

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:04.000
parts.
Those will be real and they

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:08.000
will give real and two
solutions.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:10.000
In other words,
the program is exactly like

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:14.000
what we did for second-order
differential equations.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:18.000
We used the complex numbers,
got complex solutions.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:22.000
And then, at the very last
step, we took the real and

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:26.000
imaginary parts to get two real
solutions out of each complex

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:31.000
number.
I would like to give you a

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:33.000
simple example of working that
out.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:36.000
And it is the system x prime
equals x plus 2y.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:41.000
And y prime equals minus x

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:45.000
minus y.
Because it is springtime,

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:51.000
it doesn't feel like spring but
it will this weekend as it is

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:57.000
getting warmer.
And since, when I am too tired

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:02.000
to make up problem sets for you
late at night,

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:07.000
I watch reruns of Seinfeld.
I am from New York.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:12.000
It is just in my bloodstream.
Of course, the most interesting

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:18.000
character on Seinfeld is George.
We are going to consider Susan

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:25.000
who is the girlfriend who got
killed by licking poison

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:30.000
envelopes.
And George carried on their

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:34.000
love affair until Susan was
disposed of by the writers by

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:39.000
this strange death.
And we are going to consider x

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:45.000
is modeling Susan's love for
George.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:49.000
That is x.
And George's love for Susan

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:53.000
will be y.
Now, I don't mean the absolute

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:57.000
love.
If x and y are zero,

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:59.000
I don't mean that they don't
love each other.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:04.000
I just mean that that is the
equilibrium value of the love.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:11.000
Everything else is measured as
departures from that.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:16.000
So (0, 0) represents the normal
amount of love,

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:21.000
if love is measured.
I don't know what love units

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:26.000
are.
Hearts, I guess.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:28.000
Six hearts, let's say.
Now, in what sense does this

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:33.000
model it?
This is a normal equation and

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:38.000
this is a neurotic equation.
That is why this is George and

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:42.000
this is Susan who seemed very
normal to me.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:45.000
Susan is a normal person.
When y is positive that means

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:49.000
that George seems to be loving
her more today than yesterday,

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:53.000
and her natural response is to
be more in love with him.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:57.000
That is what most people are.
If y is negative,

00:38:54.000 --> 00:39:00.000
hey, what's the matter with
George?

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:03.000
He doesn't feel so good.
Maybe there is something wrong

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:08.000
with him.
She gets a little mad at him

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:12.000
and this goes down.
x prime is negative.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:16.000
And the same way why is this
positive?

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:19.000
Well, again,
it is a psychological thing,

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:23.000
but all the world loves a
lover.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:26.000
When Susan is in love,
as she feels x is high,

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:30.000
that makes her feel good.
And she loves everything,

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:34.000
in fact.
Not just George.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:38.000
It is one of those things.
You all know what I am talking

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:44.000
about.
Now, George,

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:46.000
of course, is what makes the
writers happy.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:50.000
George is neurotic and,
therefore, is exactly the

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:55.000
opposite.
He sees one day that he feels

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:59.000
more in love with Susan than he
was yesterday.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:06.000
Does this make him happy?
Not at all.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:08.000
Not at all.
It makes y prime more negative.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:11.000
Why?
Because all he can think of is,

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:14.000
my God, suppose I am really in
love with this girl?

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:17.000
Suppose I marry her.
Oh, my God, 40 years of seeing

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:21.000
the same person at breakfast all
the time.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:24.000
I must be crazy.
And so it goes down.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:26.000
Here is our neurotic model.
The question for differential

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:30.000
equations is,
what do the solutions to that

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:33.000
look like?
In other words,

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:37.000
how does, in fact,
their love affair go?

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:40.000
Now, there is a reason why the
writers picked that model,

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:45.000
as you will see.
It means they were able to get

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:50.000
a year's worth of episodes out
of it.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:53.000
And why is that so?
Well, let's solve it.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:56.000
The characteristic equation is
lambda squared.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:41:00.000
The matrix that governs this
system is A equals (1,

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:05.000
2; negative 1,
negative 1)

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:08.000
The trace of that matrix,

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:12.000
the sum of the diagonal
elements is zero.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:16.000
There is the zero lambda here.
The determinant,

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:19.000
which is the constant term,
is negative 1,

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:22.000
minus negative 2,
which is plus 1.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:25.000
So the characteristic equation,
by calculating the trace and

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:29.000
determinant is lambda squared
plus 1 equals 0.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:34.000
The eigenvalues are plus and

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:38.000
minus i.
Now, you don't have to pick

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:41.000
both of them because the
negative one lead to essentially

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:46.000
the same solutions but with
negative signs.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:50.000
Either one will do just as we
solved second order equations.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:55.000
The system for finding the
eigenvectors,

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:59.000
well, we are going to have to
accept the complex eigenvector.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:06.000
What is the system going to be?
Well, I take the matrix and I

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:11.000
subtract i.
We will use i.

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:13.000
Subtract i from the main
diagonal.

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:16.000
So the system is (1 minus i)
times a1 plus 2a2 is zero.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:21.000
And let's, for good measure,

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:25.000
write the other one down,
too.

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:28.000
It is negative a1 plus minus (1
minus i) times a2.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:34.000
Then what is the solution?

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:39.000
Well, you get the solution the
usual way.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:45.000
Let's take a1 equal to 1.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:50.000
Then what is a2?
a2 is 1 minus i divided by 2

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:56.000
from the first equation.

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:04.000
So the complex solution is 1
minus i over 2 times

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:08.000
e to the it.
Now you have to take the real

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:11.000
and imaginary parts of that.
This is the only part which

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:15.000
technically I would not trust
you to do without having someone

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:19.000
show you how to do it.
What do you do?

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:21.000
Well, of course,
you know how to separate the

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:24.000
real and imaginary parts of
that.

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:26.000
It is the first thing is to
separate the vectors.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:31.000
I don't know how to explain
this.

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:35.000
Just watch.
The real part of it is 1,

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:39.000
one-half.
It should be negative 1,

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:43.000
so minus this plus that because
I didn't put that on the right

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:51.000
side.
It is minus one-half plus i

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:55.000
times (0, one-half).

00:43:54.000 --> 00:44:00.000
Anybody want to fight?

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:06.000
1 plus i times 0 minus one-half
plus one-half times i.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:12.000
You saw how I did that?
Okay.

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:16.000
When you do these problem you
do it the same way,

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:22.000
but don't ask me to explain
what I just did.

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:27.000
Here it is cosine t plus i sine
t.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:36.000
And so the real part will give
me one solution.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:40.000
The imaginary part will give me
another.

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:45.000
Since I have a limited amount
of time, let's just calculate

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:51.000
the real part.
What is it?

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:54.000
Well, it is (1,
minus ½) times cosine t,

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:58.000
i squared is negative 1,
so minus (0,

00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:02.000
one-half), the negative 1 from
the i squared,

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:07.000
times sine t.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:10.000
Now, what solution is that?

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:16.000
This is (x, y).
Take the final step.

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:19.000
It doesn't have to look like
that.

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:22.000
x equals cosine t.

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:25.000
Do you see that?
x equals cosine t plus 0 times

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:30.000
sine t.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:33.000
What is y?
y is minus one-half times

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:37.000
cosine t, minus one-half times
sine t, plus sine t.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:43.000
Now, you may have the pleasure

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:48.000
of showing eliminating t.
You get a quadratic polynomial

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:53.000
in x and y equals zero.
This is an ellipse.

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:57.000
As t varies,
you can see this repeats its

00:45:55.000 --> 00:46:01.000
values at intervals of 2pi,
this gives an ellipse.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:07.000
And if you want to use a little
computer program,

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:11.000
linear phase,
this is not in the assignment,

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:15.000
but the ellipses look like this
and go around that way.

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:20.000
And that is the model of George
and Susan's love.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:25.000
x, Susan.
y, George.

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:27.000
They go round and round in this
little love circle,

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:31.000
and it stretches on for 26
episodes.
