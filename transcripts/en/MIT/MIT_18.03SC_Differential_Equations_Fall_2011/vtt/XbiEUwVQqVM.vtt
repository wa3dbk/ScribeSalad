00:00:05.258 --> 00:00:06.820
PROFESSOR: Welcome back.

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:08.660
So in this session
we're going to cover

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.450
homogeneous constant coefficient
equations for any roots.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.170
So we're told to
assume that z of t

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.960
is equal to exponential minus 3t
times cosine plus i of sine t.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.850
And to assume that
this complex number is

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.025
a solution to this
differential equation, which

00:00:26.025 --> 00:00:28.350
is second order with
constant coefficients m,

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:34.160
b, and k, which are real,
and from this assumption

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.620
give two real solutions
to this equation.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.740
In the second part, we're asked
to find a general solution

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.770
for this other differential
equation, which

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.230
is the same form as
that seen in part a,

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.220
with now the real values for
b equals to 6, m equals to 1,

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.410
and k equals to 10.

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.710
And then we're asked
of this system that

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.330
would be captured by this
differential equation is

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.510
overdamped or underdamped.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.300
In the last part we
switch gears and we're

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.379
given a series of
roots, eight roots

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.760
to an eighth degree
polynomial, and we're

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.040
asked to write down the general
solution for that polynomial.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.200
Note that here we have repeated
roots, which is basically

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.240
where the trick is.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.050
So why don't you
take a few minutes,

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.260
and we'll come back to
solve these problems.

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:32.900
Welcome back.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:38.510
So for the first part,
we're given a complex number

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:46.301
clearly split into its real
part and its imaginary part.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.242
So this is the
imaginary part of z,

00:01:53.242 --> 00:01:56.080
and this is the real part of z.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.940
Now, the differential
equation that we are given

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:08.930
is constant value-- differential
equation second order, linear,

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:09.870
and homogeneous.

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:11.550
So there is no right-hand side.

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.380
So clearly you can see that
if a complex number that

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.580
can be written as real
part plus i imaginary part

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.840
is a solution to this equation,
then both sides independently

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.050
are also solutions
to this equation.

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.250
So by giving us
this complex number,

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.590
we are actually given
two types of solutions

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.460
that we can then
write down as two

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.450
linearly independent solutions.

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.110
So the general solution to
this differential equation

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:44.820
can then be written in the form
of-- one constant coefficient

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:52.960
is undetermined, minus 3t
cos t plus another constant

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:59.440
coefficient minus 3t sine of t.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.260
Where basically,
we're introducing

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.860
a linear combination of two
linearly independent solutions

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.320
that were just taken from
the original complex number

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.040
we were given.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:16.130
So for the second
part now, we are

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:22.750
asked to find a general
solution for the ODE.

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.660
We'll just rewrite here for now.

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.050
So again, constant coefficient,
homogeneous equation.

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.080
And we're just asked to
find a general solution.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.820
So we learned from
the class notes

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.730
that we can use the
characteristic polynomial

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.080
method to solve this equation.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.830
And the characteristic
polynomial

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:41.970
here will have this form.

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.680
And basically, we
just need to find

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.960
the roots of this
characteristic polynomial

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.920
to be able then to
express the solutions

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.620
of this homogeneous constant
coefficient equation in terms

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:01.900
of function, exponential to
whatever roots we will find.

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.510
So I just want to write
down the discriminant

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.340
of this polynomial.

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.510
So what do we have here?

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.500
What was the question again?

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.470
So we're asked then to
just find the discriminant

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:17.579
for this equation.

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:26.590
So b squared minus 40,
which is basically minus 4.

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.535
So we have a discriminant
that is negative.

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:41.390
And the roots for our polynomial
here are just going to be...

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:50.130
the root absolute value
of the discriminant

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.910
with the complex number
i out, because we

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:55.720
had a negative discriminant.

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.780
So these couple of
solutions, plus or minus,

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.650
tell us that we are going to
have oscillations as solutions

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.670
for this differential
equation, and that it's also

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:08.670
going to be actually
damped oscillations,

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:11.012
because we have the
first-- the real part

00:05:11.012 --> 00:05:12.220
of the number being negative.

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:19.570
So let me just write down
the pair of solutions

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:22.320
that we would have.

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:31.110
We will have this that comes
out of the real part, cosine.

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.410
I'll put the root
of 4 is just 2.

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:38.460
And so we have
cosine t, that's one.

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:42.810
6/2, of course, is just 3.

00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:02.600
So here I switched directly
to writing them in cosine

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.720
and sine, in the forms.

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:09.550
But we could also have
kept it in the complex form

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:12.330
if we were solving the
equation in complex space.

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.330
And then we would just
have complex exponentials

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.990
here with the frequencies
omega-- angular frequency 1.

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:20.060
So this is the
homogeneous equation,

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:25.750
the homogeneous solution for
this homogeneous constant

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:27.680
coefficient
differential equation.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:28.940
Now, what do we see?

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:32.110
We can see that it's exactly
the same form that the solution

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:34.560
that we had previously.

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:38.430
And so the question here is
this oscillator overdamped

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:40.680
or underdamped?

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:43.550
And as we see here, we're
going to have oscillations

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:47.990
that are damped by a pre-factor
of decaying exponential minus

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:49.730
3t for both cases.

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:51.890
So this is decaying.

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:53.270
So there is definitely damping.

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:54.770
And we can see that
here, because we

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:56.660
had a positive
value for b, which

00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:00.070
is the damping term in
the oscillator system.

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:02.800
But there are
still oscillations,

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.410
because we had a discriminant
that was negative,

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:07.800
which introduced complex
numbers, hence cosines

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:10.920
and sines, so
basically, oscillations.

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:15.440
Therefore we're in the case
of an underdamped response,

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:16.410
an underdamped system.

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:30.580
The discriminant was negative.

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:41.120
So for the last part
of this problem,

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:43.440
we now leave this
differential equation,

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:47.030
which was second order, and move
to higher-order differential

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:48.470
equations of eighth order.

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:51.460
And we're given eight roots.

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:57.024
4 minus 5i.

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:03.070
We have the root of
3, which is real,

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:07.710
which is repeated three times,
and a root 4 plus or minus 5i,

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:09.460
which is repeated two times.

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:11.360
So we saw before then
when we have repeated

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:13.670
roots, that means
that we would have,

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:16.090
let's say, in a second-order
differential equation.

00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:18.460
We would have in this
case a discriminant

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:19.610
that would be equal to 0.

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:22.530
And we would need to introduce
a different type of solution,

00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:27.250
because instead of introducing
an exponential of plus r*t,

00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:30.226
exponential minus r*t, now
we don't have the minus r*t.

00:08:30.226 --> 00:08:32.059
So we need to seek
another type of solution.

00:08:32.059 --> 00:08:34.429
And we'll multiply
the exponential by t.

00:08:34.429 --> 00:08:38.299
So one type of solution for this
unique root that would come out

00:08:38.299 --> 00:08:40.370
would be just 2t.

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:45.240
For the first of the tripled
root, it would be a 3t.

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:48.920
For the second one,
we would have t 3t.

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:55.860
For the third one, we need
to go higher order, 3t.

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:58.230
Now we have complex
roots, so that gives us

00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:02.590
solutions of the same form that
we found in questions a and b.

00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:06.900
So I'm going to just
write them here,

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:21.850
where now we have e^(4t)
cosine 5t plus e^(4t) sine 5t.

00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:24.070
And for the repeated
root, it's the same game.

00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:26.540
Even though we're in complex
roots, it's the same idea,

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:29.272
we need to multiply
all of it by t.

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:48.140
So these are the families of
linearly independent solutions

00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:49.930
that would come
out of these roots.

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:52.400
So now the general
solution is simply

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:55.360
the linear combination of all
these linearly independent

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:57.940
functions.

00:09:57.940 --> 00:09:59.860
So we will introduce
different constants.

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:12.470
c_5, c_6, c_7, and c_8.

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:17.430
And we have eight undetermined
coefficients to deal with,

00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:19.880
because these would
be eight roots

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:21.530
of an eighth-order polynomial.

00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:23.440
And so if we were to
solve an initial value

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:26.120
problems like that, we would
need eight different types

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:27.770
of initial conditions
to determine

00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:29.950
the values of these constants.

00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:33.230
So to summarize, we used the
characteristic polynomial

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:38.390
method to solve these
problems introducing

00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:41.460
higher-order equations than
the first-order differential

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:42.880
equations we saw before.

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:45.330
And what is
important to remember

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:48.590
is that the different types
of solutions that you get,

00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:52.450
depending on the roots of
the characteristic polynomial

00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:53.930
and the sine of
the discriminant.

00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:56.270
So whether the roots
are real or purely

00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:58.750
imaginary or
imaginary numbers will

00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:00.890
give three types
of the behavior:

00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:03.530
the critically damped
behavior; if it's real

00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:06.050
then it's going to be
just overdamped behavior;

00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:08.260
and if the roots
are complex, then it

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:09.970
would be underdamped behavior.

00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:12.790
Now when we are given
different types of roots,

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:14.540
with repeated roots
it's important to know

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:16.650
how to construct the
solutions as well.

00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:19.260
And that's by introducing
new types of functions where

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:23.150
we're multiplying
by polynomial in t

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:25.400
in front of the exponential.

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:27.862
So that ends the
session for today.
