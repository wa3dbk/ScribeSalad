LYDIA BOUROUIBA: Welcome
to this presentation

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:09.290
on the trace-determinant
diagram.

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.730
So here, you're asked to
label the regions and lines

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.500
of the trace-determinant diagram
for a 2 x 2 general system,

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.460
written in the form
x prime equals A*x,

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.000
and to indicate the
stability on your diagram.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.240
So here, as a
reminder, this system

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.770
is simply a system of two
differential equations

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.750
in vector form.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.280
The derivative of [x, y] equals
[a, b; c, d], a 2 x 2 matrix,

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.190
multiplying the vector [x, y].

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.410
Or in another form, it
would be x-dot equals

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.500
f of x, y, and y-dot equals j
of x, y, where the t wouldn't

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.690
appear in f and j
here, functions,

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.920
which means that the
system would be autonomous.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.140
And we're dealing
with linear systems.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.950
So why don't you
pause the video.

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:55.530
Take a few minutes
remind yourself

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.772
what the trace-determinant
diagram is and how to label it,

00:00:58.772 --> 00:00:59.730
and I'll be right back.

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.620
Welcome back.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.520
So let's remind ourselves where
this trace-determinant diagram

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:16.590
comes from.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.720
So initially, what we saw
before was to solve this system,

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:27.370
we need to find the
eigenvalues of the matrix A.

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.770
The eigenvalues are solutions
of this equation, which

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.290
can be written in the form
lambda square minus trace

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:42.150
of lambda plus determinant
of A equals to 0.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.050
Let's call this D, and this
T. And the trace of A is just

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.180
the sum of the
diagonals of the matrix,

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.286
and the determinant is just,
in this case for a 2 x 2,

00:01:52.286 --> 00:01:55.680
a*d minus c*b.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:06.390
So the solutions for-- I'm going
to call them plus and minus--

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.440
for this second-order
polynomial will simply

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:17.830
be T plus or minus the
root of the determinant

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:24.930
of second-order polynomial,
which is T square minus 4D.

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.782
So the sign of T
square minus 4D is

00:02:26.782 --> 00:02:28.490
going to determine
whether we are dealing

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.890
with real eigenvalues
or complex eigenvalues,

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.780
or simply repeated
eigenvalues if we

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.905
have this determinant under
the root being equal to 0.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:50.340
So just as a reminder here,
if we have T square over 4

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.830
equals to D, we are in the
case, well, this is equal to 0.

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.890
Lambda plus or
minus are the same,

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.470
and they're just equal
to the trace over 2.

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:02.960
So the sign of
the trace is going

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.640
to determine whether we have two
repeated negative eigenvalues

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.790
or two repeated
positive eigenvalues.

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:14.720
Now, if we have the
determinant of the matrix

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.694
A is larger than T square over
4, then we are above the curve

00:03:19.694 --> 00:03:21.985
determined by this equation,
which is a parabola, which

00:03:21.985 --> 00:03:24.690
I'll draw in a minute.

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.940
And in this case, we have
the number under the root

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.560
being negative, so we're dealing
with complex eigenvalues.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.630
And basically, they're
just complex conjugate

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.210
of each other.

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:39.880
And you can notice here
that the trace would

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.400
be also the sum of
the two eigenvalues,

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:50.040
and basically we would just have
2 times the real part of lambda

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.676
plus or minus, just as a note.

00:03:54.676 --> 00:03:58.550
And in the third case, where
we have that the determinant is

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:03.350
below T square over 4,
we're in the case where

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:05.390
this number under
the root is positive,

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.010
so we're dealing with
two real eigenvalues.

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.590
So here, I should
mention this is real.

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.070
Lambda plus, lambda minus real.

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:17.940
And we can have multiple cases.

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:23.602
We can have lambda plus
larger than lambda minus,

00:04:23.602 --> 00:04:24.185
both positive.

00:04:24.185 --> 00:04:29.007
We can have lambda plus,
less than lambda minus,

00:04:29.007 --> 00:04:29.590
both negative.

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.585
Or we can have lambda plus
positive and lambda minus

00:04:34.585 --> 00:04:35.085
negative.

00:04:35.085 --> 00:04:38.570
And each case will give
us a different behavior

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:39.660
of the system.

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.650
So let's first summarize
this in this following

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.200
determinant-trace
diagram, and then we'll

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.074
start labeling this diagram.

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:55.506
I should probably keep a
little more space here.

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.450
So this is basically D
equal T square over 4

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:11.940
in our trace-determinant
diagram.

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:20.970
I'm going to also erase this
part and just keep it in dots.

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:23.730
So in the first case
that we looked at,

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:27.420
we are in the case where we
are right on this parabola.

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:31.870
So that's the case where we have
lambda plus equal lambda minus.

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.430
And you can see that if
the trace is positive,

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.060
so if we are on the right
hand side of the diagram,

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.140
that we're going to have two
positive eigenvalues that

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:44.120
are both real, and
they are repeated.

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:45.920
So we can have multiple cases.

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:49.700
We can have the case where we
have a defective matrix, where

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.880
basically here we only have
one eigenvector associated

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.610
with this repeated eigenvalue.

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.560
And we have a
defective case where

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.260
we need to come up with a
second eigenvector using

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.600
the generalized
eigenvector formula.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.210
And I'm not going
to write this here,

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:06.140
but I'm going to just
to do the diagram.

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:12.480
So for example, we would
have one direction, v_1,

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:16.410
where we would have in this
case lambda_1 and lambda minus

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:18.960
positive.

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:23.332
So in the phase space, in
y-x, the little diagram

00:06:23.332 --> 00:06:24.790
would show us that
the solution are

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:28.100
escaping from the critical
point, the equilibrium point.

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.280
And the second solution that we
build would have a dependence

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:35.610
in t*v_1, plus the
second eigenvector v_2,

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:38.420
also directed by the
positive eigenvalue.

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:40.020
And so, we would
have a solution,

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:46.740
for example, that would look
like this, with the solution

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:50.380
escaping from the critical
point because, again, we

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:53.310
are in the case where the
two eigenvalues are positive.

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:55.430
And so here, we could
have it in this form,

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:59.780
or we can also have the
diagram in the other direction.

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:03.523
And I'll to it in the other
direction on the other wing

00:07:03.523 --> 00:07:04.610
of the diagram.

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:05.860
So this is the defective case.

00:07:09.684 --> 00:07:13.330
Defective node.

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:17.220
The other possibility that we
could have on this parabola--

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:20.180
and I'm going to just to it
here-- will be the case where

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:23.990
we actually have
all the direction

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:27.850
could be eigenvectors
associated with this eigenvalue.

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:30.410
And this would be, for
example, for a diagonal matrix.

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:32.680
In which case,
all the directions

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:38.330
would be escaping-- all
the trajectories would

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.880
be escaping-- from
the critical point.

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:44.190
And this would be a star.

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:49.040
Obviously here, we are
in the unstable case

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:51.150
for the defective
node, and we are also

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:55.670
in the unstable
case for the star,

00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:58.420
because all the solutions are
escaping and basically going

00:07:58.420 --> 00:07:58.920
away.

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:02.377
So if I start at the equilibrium
and I perturb it a little bit,

00:08:02.377 --> 00:08:04.710
the solutions would want to
escape from that equilibrium

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:06.980
point.

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:12.060
On the other side here, it would
be exactly the same structure,

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:14.730
except that I would
have stability

00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:16.150
because the trace is negative.

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:25.390
So I would have
asymptotically stable star.

00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:26.460
Why asymptotically?

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:27.950
Because basically,
it's when t goes

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:29.950
to infinity that the
trajectories reach

00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:31.580
the critical point.

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:36.240
And this is again in the
phase space y-x diagram.

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:40.020
For the defective node,
we would have this time,

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:42.970
for example, direction
v_1 attracting

00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:44.980
the solutions, the ray v_1.

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:49.810
And the new trajectory that
we will be constructing based

00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:55.050
on v_1 again would be t*v_1 plus
v_2, generalized eigenvector.

00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:58.129
Both of them would
give us solutions

00:08:58.129 --> 00:08:59.670
that converge toward
the equilibrium,

00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:02.600
because the two eigenvalues
here are negative.

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:14.409
And so, we have that for
large time, minus infinity,

00:09:14.409 --> 00:09:16.200
the solution follows
v_1, for plus infinity

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.040
it's going toward the
equilibrium point,

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:19.860
also follows V1.

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:26.870
So the solutions would have to
look like this, for example.

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:38.880
And this would be asymptotically
stable defective node.

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:39.380
OK.

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:43.020
So we're done with the
points on the parabola.

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:44.650
So now let's look
at the other points,

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:47.890
and I'll go maybe a bit
less in the details.

00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:54.640
So for the case where we have
the determinant larger then T

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:57.790
square over 4, so we are
just above this parabola now,

00:09:57.790 --> 00:10:03.420
we have the case where we
have two complex eigenvalues.

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:05.370
They are two complex conjugates.

00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:10.080
So let's assume that we can
just expand our solution

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:12.210
and write it in terms
of the exponential,

00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:16.570
in terms of the real
part of the eigenvalue.

00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:18.550
So it would be determined,
again, the trace

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:20.940
will give us the sign of the
real part of the eigenvalue,

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:22.520
multiplying a cosine and a sine.

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:27.600
So we have something that
is rotating in phase space,

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:30.080
because we have basically
the periodicity.

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:32.900
But the distance to the
critical point is changing,

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:34.500
and it's either
growing, if we have

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:36.450
a positive real part
for our eigenvalues,

00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:38.110
so if we are on this side.

00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:42.620
Or decaying if we are on the
left side of the diagram.

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:46.010
So that gives us
typically spirals.

00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:53.870
So for example, that would
be a spiral, going toward 0,

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:56.160
toward the equilibrium
point in phase space.

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:57.850
And here, we would
be in the case

00:10:57.850 --> 00:11:02.770
where we have instability
due to the fact

00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:05.000
that the real part of the
eigenvalue determining

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.590
stability is positive.

00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:08.950
And so the solution
of the trajectories

00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:12.450
escape from the critical point.

00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:16.585
And similarly here, we could
have the same structure,

00:11:16.585 --> 00:11:20.250
but I'm just going to draw
it in another direction.

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:22.920
Where here, we would
have stability.

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:23.430
Oops.

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:25.220
They should not cross.

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:27.816
This is not the right
way to draw this.

00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:35.400
And it would be going
toward the critical point.

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:37.110
So here, just a quick note.

00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:39.480
You can have this trajectory
being drawn this way.

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:42.665
So here, we have basically
a clockwise motion.

00:11:42.665 --> 00:11:44.690
But we could also
have it be drawn

00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:49.180
in the other way for both cases,
giving us another direction

00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:50.610
of rotation in phase space.

00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:52.410
And the direction
that you choose

00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:59.060
will be determined by the lowest
left entry of your matrix A,

00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:02.090
and I will just explain
quickly how we do that.

00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:02.590
OK.

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:06.980
So we have basically here
unstable spiral node,

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:16.270
and here it's again
asymptotically stable spiral.

00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:18.620
So what happens now if
we are in this case?

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:20.640
We're still above
the parabola, so we

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:25.410
have still complex eigenvalues.

00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:29.600
However, we have now
the fact that the trace

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:32.600
is equal to 0, which means
that the eigenvalues don't

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:33.760
have any real part.

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:36.450
So basically, we have
pure oscillation.

00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:38.660
And in the phase
space, that corresponds

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:43.060
to closed trajectories that
could be circles or ellipses,

00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:44.100
basically.

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:48.460
And so for example,
we would have

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:50.995
something in this form that
would be called the center.

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:58.540
And here again, you can
have either counterclockwise

00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:01.900
or a clockwise rotation
in phase space depending

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:07.740
on the signs of the
entries of your matrix.

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:13.110
So one thing I want to note
is that here, the stability

00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:18.020
for the center we say that
it's simply stable, and not

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:20.250
asymptotically stable,
because the solution

00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:23.390
never actually reaches
the critical point,

00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:26.800
but stays in the region
around the critical point.

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:30.290
So we're left with a
few other cases that

00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:32.490
are now all below the parabola.

00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:35.990
And for that, we just
have real eigenvalues.

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:39.010
So let's look at the case
where the eigenvalues have

00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:40.500
two different signs.

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:43.430
So for that, we have to have
the determinant being negative.

00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:46.102
So this whole lower
part of the diagram,

00:13:46.102 --> 00:13:48.685
because the determinant is the
product of the two eigenvalues.

00:13:48.685 --> 00:13:51.080
So if they have different
signs, we're in this region.

00:13:51.080 --> 00:14:00.690
So in this case, we could have,
for example, one eigenvalue,

00:14:00.690 --> 00:14:04.420
with associated eigenvector
v_1, being negative.

00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:06.990
So the trajectories
along this ray

00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:09.110
would be going toward
equilibrium point.

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:15.915
And then the other
eigenvalue will be positive.

00:14:15.915 --> 00:14:19.230
So for example, lambda_2
here would correspond

00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:23.340
to this other eigenvector v_2.

00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:25.610
And so here, we
would have solutions

00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:28.910
that would be close
to v_2 when we're

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:32.289
coming, for example, from
minus infinity approaching

00:14:32.289 --> 00:14:33.080
the critical point.

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:37.030
And then going back,
approaching v_2

00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:39.350
when we go at t plus
infinity, for example.

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:44.750
And so it gives us
pseudo-hyperbola form here,

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:45.850
of this form.

00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:57.330
And this is said to be unstable,
because all those solutions do

00:14:57.330 --> 00:14:58.740
not go to the critical point.

00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:00.400
But we have some
stable manifolds.

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:01.980
For example, the v_1.

00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:03.757
If we start on this
ray, we would be going

00:15:03.757 --> 00:15:04.840
toward the critical point.

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:06.330
And if we start at the
critical point itself,

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:07.830
it would stay at
the critical point.

00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:09.150
But it is unstable.

00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:11.350
So now what happened in
these two different regions,

00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:12.506
to finish.

00:15:12.506 --> 00:15:15.130
In these two different regions--
and I'm going to have a little

00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:16.230
bit more space here--

00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:18.037
AUDIENCE: It's called a saddle.

00:15:18.037 --> 00:15:19.120
LYDIA BOUROUIBA: Oh, yeah.

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:19.715
Thank you.

00:15:19.715 --> 00:15:22.340
And this would be a saddle, and
it's just because of the shape.

00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:29.230
I'm going to just add
a little bit of space

00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:34.750
here, so that we can
complete the diagram.

00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:38.820
I'll be basically looking at
the regions here in the wedge,

00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:40.790
where we are below the parabola.

00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:42.800
And I'm looking
for another color.

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:46.210
Maybe I'll just use white.

00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:51.360
Now we are in the case where
we would have two eigenvalues.

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:53.480
Both real, so no oscillation.

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:57.480
But let's say both positive,
because we're basically

00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:00.370
on the region where
the trace is positive.

00:16:00.370 --> 00:16:02.810
Let's say that we
have one ray, v_1.

00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:04.250
One ray, v_2.

00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:07.100
The trajectories are going
away from the critical point,

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:10.840
because the two
eigenvalues are positive.

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:13.730
And now, what do the
other trajectories do,

00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:17.845
where they follow--
so for example,

00:16:17.845 --> 00:16:22.110
they would be following v_2.

00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:24.220
And I'm going to explain how.

00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:28.800
So here, we're in the case
where obviously we're unstable,

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:30.730
because again, the
solution, the trajectories

00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:32.530
are going away from
the critical point.

00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:36.530
And here, how do
you pick which ray

00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:38.970
do you follow when you get
closer to the critical point?

00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:41.630
Where in this case, we
would be in a situation

00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:49.720
where we have lambda_2 smaller
than lambda_1, larger than 0.

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:53.215
So basically, the lambda 2
that is the closer to 0--

00:16:53.215 --> 00:16:55.090
and that's also the
case for the positive

00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:57.550
and the negative
eigenvalues-- is

00:16:57.550 --> 00:17:00.360
the one that determines
the solution closer

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:01.390
to the critical point.

00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:05.950
And the larger in absolute
value eigenvalue and its ray

00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:07.635
then determines the behavior--

00:17:11.839 --> 00:17:12.339
Oh, sorry.

00:17:12.339 --> 00:17:13.297
There's a mistake here.

00:17:13.297 --> 00:17:14.530
It should be lambda_1.

00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:19.720
I said it, but I think
I wrote it reversely.

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:23.079
Yeah The eigenvalue closer
to 0 is the one that

00:17:23.079 --> 00:17:24.329
determines the behavior at 0.

00:17:24.329 --> 00:17:26.280
So here, when we're
going to infinity,

00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:28.910
the larger eigenvalue lambda_2
will determine the behavior,

00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:32.530
and the trajectories will become
more and more parallel to v_2.

00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:34.510
So what happens
on this side would

00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:36.880
be exactly the same
diagram, and I'm just

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:45.560
going to do it with the
same-- let's say, v_2 here.

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:54.790
Except that we would
have our trajectories

00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:56.260
going toward the critical point.

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:03.950
And the trajectory
here again would

00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:07.240
be closer to v_1, which means
that we would have a case where

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:12.600
we have lambda_1 less than
0 and larger than lambda_2.

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:14.920
So that finishes
roughly the diagram.

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:18.530
I didn't detail a few
borderline regions.

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:22.360
For example, the region where
the determinant equals to 0.

00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:25.740
And we will discuss that
in another recitation.

00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:29.330
And the case also at which
the determinant and the trace

00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:30.057
are equal to 0.

00:18:30.057 --> 00:18:31.140
So we'll detail that also.

00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:35.890
But try to think about it,
to complete this diagram.

00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:38.280
So the key points
here were to remember

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:42.960
what is the determinant-trace
diagram, how

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:45.910
to basically deduce the nature
of the eigenvalues based

00:18:45.910 --> 00:18:47.710
on T and D, their sign.

00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:51.000
And where to place the
different structures

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.540
on this determinant-trace
diagram.

00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:55.820
And that ends this recitation.
