00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.010
PROFESSOR: Welcome back.

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:08.468
So today we're
going to take a look

00:00:08.468 --> 00:00:11.230
at a problem with
partial fractions,

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.360
and specifically how to
use these partial fractions

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.379
to compute Laplace inverses.

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.230
So just as a
warm-up, we're asked

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.690
to recall what the formula is
for the Laplace transform of f

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:26.690
prime, in terms of the
Laplace transform of f.

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:28.430
In the second part,
we're asked to find

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.070
the inverse Laplace transform
for three different functions.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.750
The first one is 1
over s squared minus 4,

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.240
s squared divided by
s squared plus 4, e

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.800
to the minus 5s divided
by s squared minus 4.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.340
And notice how none
of these functions

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.930
appear in the look-up table
for Laplace transform.

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.460
So in each case, we have
to use partial fractions

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.620
to convert it or massage
these functions into something

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.820
which we do know the Laplace
transform inverse for.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.530
And then lastly, for
the third problem

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.800
we're asked to write
down the partial fraction

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.330
decomposition of this
function, 1 over s

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.430
squared times s squared plus 4
times s plus 1 times s plus 3.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.540
And specifically, when we do the
partial fraction decomposition,

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.840
we're just going to leave
the undetermined coefficients

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:20.340
unknown.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.330
We're not actually
going to solve for them.

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.830
OK?

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.310
So I'll let you think
about this problem.

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:25.518
And I'll be back in a moment.

00:01:35.521 --> 00:01:36.640
Hi everyone.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:37.800
Welcome back.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:38.300
OK.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.485
So for part one,
we're just asked

00:01:41.485 --> 00:01:45.250
to recall the Laplace
transform of f prime in terms

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.410
of the Laplace transform of f.

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.700
So the Laplace
transform of f prime

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:58.230
we can write down as s times the
Laplace transform of F, which

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:04.640
I'll use capital F, minus
f evaluated at the lower

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.440
bound of the Laplace transform
integral, which in this case

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.220
is just zero minus.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:10.720
OK.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:11.900
So this is just part one.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.690
This is a warm-up problem.

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.310
For part two,
we're asked to find

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.540
the inverse Laplace transform
for three different functions.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.480
The first one is 1
over s squared minus 4.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.720
And we see here that we can
factor the denominator into 1

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:38.870
over s minus 2 times 1 over s
plus 2, which means that we can

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.820
use a partial fraction
decomposition which

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:47.030
has the form of A
divided by s minus 2

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.220
plus B divided by s plus 2.

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.034
And then we need to solve
for the coefficients A and B.

00:02:56.034 --> 00:02:57.700
So one way to solve
for the coefficients

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.310
A and B is just to multiply
both sides of this equation

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.060
through by the factors
s minus 2 and s plus 2.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.595
We can then plug in values
of s and solve for A and B.

00:03:08.595 --> 00:03:10.220
There's another way,
which is sometimes

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.920
referred to a cover-up method.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.780
And in this case,
what we do is we pick,

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.600
for example, say
one of the places

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.310
where the denominator blows up.

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.460
So for example, if we look
at this factor s minus 2,

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:28.260
this factor diverges
when s approaches 2.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.120
So then what we do is we go
back to our original function,

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.420
we cover up the term s minus
2 where it diverges, and then

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.690
in the remaining term, we
plug in the value of s which

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.570
causes the factor s
minus 2 to diverge.

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:48.940
So in this case, s
minus 2 diverges at 2.

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.260
So we would cover this
factor up and then plug

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.440
in s is equal to 2.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.615
And this would give us the
value of A. So for this problem,

00:03:57.615 --> 00:04:04.760
A is equal to 1 over 2 plus
2, which is just 1 over 4.

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.530
For B, we look at plugging
in s equals negative 2.

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.520
So we cover up the
factor that diverges

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.720
in the original function.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.029
Plugging in s equals negative
2 gives me negative 2

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:17.720
minus negative 2.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:18.970
So B is just negative 4.

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:30.820
So this function is 1/4 1
over s minus 2 minus 1/4 1

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.160
over s plus 2.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.960
And when we take the
inverse Laplace transform,

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:46.060
so the inverse Laplace transform
of 1 over s squared minus 4

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.440
is going to be 1 over 4-- the
inverse Laplace transform of s

00:04:50.440 --> 00:05:01.180
minus 2 is e to the plus 2t.

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:06.215
The second factor is negative
1/4 e to the negative 2t.

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.150
And this concludes
the first problem.

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:18.230
For the second function,
we have s squared

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:21.810
divided by s squared plus 4.

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.150
So again, this function's
not in the correct form

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.050
to use a Laplace
transform look-up table.

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.880
But what we can do
is we can divide--

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.484
long division of polynomials--
the numerator out

00:05:33.484 --> 00:05:34.275
by the denominator.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:48.300
So when we do that we end
up with 1 minus 4 divided by

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.190
s squared plus 4.

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:55.010
So when we take the inverse
Laplace transform of s

00:05:55.010 --> 00:06:00.050
squared divided by
s squared plus 4,

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.820
we're left with the inverse
Laplace transform of 1

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:08.060
minus the inverse
Laplace transform of 4

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:09.460
divided by s squared plus 4.

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:14.730
And if we use our
look-up table, we

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:17.260
know that the inverse
Laplace transform of 1

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:18.200
is the delta function.

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.740
Meanwhile, the inverse
Laplace transform

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:28.810
of some number
divided by s squared

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:35.320
plus 4 looks like, in
this case, sine of 2t.

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:38.000
Now we need a 2 upstairs,
so this is going

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.100
to give us 2 times sine of 2t.

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:52.490
And I obtain this by noting that
the Laplace transform of sine

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:58.900
omega*t is equal to omega
divided by s squared plus omega

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:00.340
squared.

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:04.190
So that's how I went from
this function, this Laplace

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:09.050
transform inverse, to 2 sine 2t.

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:14.090
Lastly, for part three,
the third problem,

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:16.190
we're asked for the inverse
Laplace transform of e

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:19.825
to the minus 5s divided
by s squared minus 4.

00:07:22.595 --> 00:07:25.960
Now note that we already know
the inverse Laplace transform

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:28.210
to 1 over s squared minus 4.

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:32.320
In this case, we're
just multiplying 1

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:35.430
over s squared minus 4
by e to the minus 5s.

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:39.770
So we can use the shift
formula in addition

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:43.030
to what we already computed,
the inverse Laplace transform

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:45.910
to 1 over s squared
minus 4, to compute

00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:48.460
this inverse Laplace transform.

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:50.790
So the shift
formula says that we

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:57.540
need to multiply by the
step function t minus 5.

00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:02.980
So we're shifting with
the step function.

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:06.680
And then what we do
is we want to shift

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:09.790
the inverse Laplace transform
of 1 over s squared minus 4.

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:13.420
So the inverse Laplace transform
to 1 over s squared minus 4

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:16.020
is 2 t minus 5.

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:21.430
So if we shift t by 5,
we end up with 1/4 e

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:31.266
to the 2 t minus 5 minus 1/4
e to the minus 2 t minus 5.

00:08:31.266 --> 00:08:32.640
So again, just to
reiterate, when

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:37.406
we have an exponential
e to the minus, say, 5s

00:08:37.406 --> 00:08:40.030
and we already know the inverse
Laplace transform of everything

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:46.530
else, we just multiply
by the step function u

00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:48.510
t minus 5, the same shift.

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:50.870
And then wherever we see
the t in the inverse Laplace

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:56.060
transform, we just replace it
with t minus 5, in this case.

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:56.560
OK?

00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:00.550
And now lastly, for
part three we're

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:04.840
just asked to write down the
decomposition for this very

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:10.990
large function, the partial
fraction decomposition

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:14.230
of this large function.

00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:18.260
So it's s squared times
s squared plus 1 times

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:22.810
s plus 1 times s plus 3.

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:29.600
Let me just double
check. s squared plus 4.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.040
OK?

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:38.600
And unfortunately
this function's

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:41.360
going to be a little ugly.

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:45.700
We're going to have a constant,
A, divided by s plus B divided

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:47.450
by s squared.

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:52.420
So these first two terms come
from this term right here.

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:54.060
For the s squared
plus 4 term, we're

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:58.560
going to seek a C
times s plus D--

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:02.870
so we need both factors,
Cs plus D-- divided by

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:05.820
s squared plus 4.

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:09.840
We have E divided by s plus 1.

00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:15.820
And then plus F
divided by s plus 3.

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:28.590
So just to associate each
factor in the partial fraction

00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:32.075
decomposition with
the original function,

00:10:32.075 --> 00:10:34.980
I've just drawn some arrows.

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:35.480
OK?

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:37.562
And then lastly,
although I didn't

00:10:37.562 --> 00:10:39.020
state this in the
original problem,

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:42.040
we can also just write down
the inverse Laplace transform

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:47.737
of this entire mess
without actually

00:10:47.737 --> 00:10:48.820
determining the constants.

00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:50.790
We can just keep
the constants in.

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:56.310
So if we wanted to compute
the inverse Laplace transform,

00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:59.460
well, it would just be A--
because inverse Laplace

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:03.890
transform of 1 over s is
1-- plus B-- inverse Laplace

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:08.100
transform of s
squared is t-- plus,

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:13.810
now this part has two terms,
Cs divided by s squared plus 4.

00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:18.800
That's going to give us
C times cosine of 2t.

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:22.780
The D divided by s squared plus
4 is going to give us, well,

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:26.820
we need to multiply upstairs by
2 and divide downstairs by 2.

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:32.500
So we get D divided
by 2 of sine 2t.

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:37.030
This term, E, is going
to give us E times

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:42.060
the exponential of negative t.

00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:53.554
And then the last term is
going to give us F times e

00:11:53.554 --> 00:11:54.220
to the minus 3t.

00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:54.719
OK?

00:11:57.590 --> 00:12:00.470
So just as a quick
wrap-up, in this problem

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:03.310
we've computed partial
fraction decompositions

00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:04.610
of several functions.

00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:08.390
And the reason we've done
this is because we often

00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:11.850
end up in a situation when
we want to solve an ODE using

00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:16.430
Laplace transforms where we
have some complicated function

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:19.340
and we need to use partial
fraction decomposition to write

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:21.570
down simpler functions,
in which case

00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:23.980
we can then use the Laplace
inverse formula on each

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:25.651
of the simpler functions.

00:12:25.651 --> 00:12:26.150
OK?

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:29.570
So I'll just conclude here,
and I'll see you next time.
