00:00:06.409 --> 00:00:08.320
PROFESSOR: Welcome
to this recitation

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.680
on the phase portrait.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.520
So you're given matrix A, a
two-by-two matrix with entries

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.840
minus 1, minus 1,
1 minus c, where

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.770
c is a constant we will
be varying, and minus 1.

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.690
As c increases from 0 to
other positive values,

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.920
determine the path of the
system on the trace-determinant

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.810
diagram that we saw in
previous recitations

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.840
and draw the phase
portraits that

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.020
corresponds to the critical
points and the nature

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.260
of the critical points.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.720
So here, we're basically
talking of a system that

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:43.830
would be a two-by-two system
where we have derivatives

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.940
of entries x, y for vector,
equals to this matrix, A_c,

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.470
multiplying the
unknown vector x_c.

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.122
So take a few minutes and
work out through this problem

00:00:55.122 --> 00:00:56.080
and I'll be right back.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.150
Welcome back.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.100
So I already prepared the
trace-determinant diagram

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.860
for you.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.330
So here as a reminder,
this is the parabola

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.360
that determines whether
we're going to have

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.640
repeated eigenvalues or not.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.780
Above this parabola, we have two
complex conjugate eigenvalues.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.650
Below this parabola, we have
real eigenvalues, either

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.610
of the same signs,
positive or negative,

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:32.680
or of different signs.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.860
And then, we have
the borderline cases.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.470
In our case here, we're
looking in a matrix A

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.470
with the trace equals to minus
1 minus 1, so it's minus 2,

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:51.870
and a determinant that
is equal to 2 minus c.

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.120
So here, we are basically
along this dotted line

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.600
where the trace
equals to minus 2.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.540
So either we're going
to have complex values

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.810
with negative real parts
or negative eigenvalues.

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.900
So we're in stable
configurations.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.720
So we're going to be
moving at c equal to 0

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:14.820
from a case where-- I'm just
going to label this point 1.

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:20.580
For example, we have the
matrix, minus 1, 1, 1, minus 1

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.150
with the trace
equals to minus 2,

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.990
and the determinant equals to 2.

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:31.960
So clearly, we are this point.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.530
And we are just going to be
increasing the value of c

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.150
and moving along these lines,
crossing this first boundary

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.160
case where we will have
either defective or not case.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.990
And I'll discuss very
briefly what we have.

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.350
And then, we have other
value where we are basically

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.620
in this area where we have
real eigenvalues, both of them

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.800
negative, so we have stability.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.820
And it would
basically be a sink.

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.350
And then we cross this
other borderline case

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.410
where the determinant
is equal to 0.

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.030
And here, we have one eigenvalue
that is equal to 0 and one

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.020
that is negative.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.980
And then, we get to do
the part of the diagram

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.860
where the determinant
is negative,

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.300
and the trace is negative.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.670
And we basically have
a saddle structure

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.220
where we have one
eigenvalue as negative

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.430
and another eigenvalue
that is positive.

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.570
So let's get through
these five cases.

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.620
And I'll just do more
detailed picture illustrating

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.760
what I just said.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.330
So just write down a bit more
in detail the first case here.

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.510
So we have the case
where the eigenvalues are

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.500
both complex
conjugate, and we have

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.170
their real part being negative.

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:58.290
So basically, we have spirals,
asymptotically stable spirals.

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.370
And the spirals could be either
clockwise or counterclockwise.

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:09.310
And one way of determining
the direction of these spirals

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.530
is to look at the
sign of the velocity

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.840
vector of the trajectories
in the phase space.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.840
So the phase space
basically diagram here

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:21.019
where we have x and y as
the axes of this space.

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:31.430
So let's look, for example, at
a particular point here that

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.550
would be velocity vector [1, 0].

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:40.100
And this position vector [1, 0]
would give us a velocity vector

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:41.970
of minus 1 and plus 1.

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.920
So basically, this vector
would be directed upward,

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.470
which means that we are in
the case where we would have

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:56.420
a spiral coming this way
toward the critical point

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:59.500
and basically with the velocity
vector here going this way.

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.680
You don't have to
actually do all this

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.680
to figure out which direction
of the spiral you should choose.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.490
You can just look-- for these
cases, two-by-two matrices--

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.400
at the entry at the lower
left part of your matrix.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.500
And if the coefficient
here is positive,

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.020
then it will determine the
direction of the velocity

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.986
vector at this point.

00:05:17.986 --> 00:05:19.360
So if it's positive
in this case,

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.440
you would have this
counterclockwise direction

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.290
of rotation of the spiral.

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:28.550
So now we can move on and do the
following cases a bit faster.

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.420
So the second case, we are
in the case where we now

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:33.420
have two repeated eigenvalues.

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:34.980
Both of them are negative.

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.900
So we can have either
a complete case.

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:39.740
If we had a matrix
that was diagonal,

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:41.680
we would have basically a star.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.600
But that's not the case,
because if we pick, for example,

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:48.430
the value c equals to 1 that
puts us on the parabola,

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:50.710
we can see that the matrix
A_c is not diagonal.

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:52.600
So we are in a defective case.

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:57.340
The defective case, if you
compute the eigenvalues

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:00.450
and eigenvector would give you
something that looks like that.

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:02.940
The first ray of the
eigenvector corresponding

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:08.400
to your eigenvalues would be
in the direction of [1, 0].

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.450
We have negative eigenvalues,
so it's going to 0.

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:13.910
And basically, to
determine the direction,

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:18.890
you have to see that we are
also following a transition here

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:20.710
on the trace-determinant
diagram.

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:24.300
And so basically, we
will have a spiral

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.130
that would look like this.

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:30.800
What am I doing?

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.018
Am I doing the same thing?

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:50.140
And it would basically
rotate, as you can see here,

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:57.750
in the same direction as the
case that we had just before.

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:00.330
Because we basically have the
transition of the structure

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:02.320
of the critical point.

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:05.510
And the arrows are pointing
toward the critical point

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:10.080
again, because our two
eigenvalues are basically

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:10.690
here negative.

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:14.270
It is just a repeated
eigenvalue that is negative.

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:16.500
So now we can move
on to a third case

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:19.640
where here we move
into the wedge area

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:22.820
where we have the two
eigenvalues now being real,

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:27.370
and both of them are negative.

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:34.100
So for example, we would
have two eigenvalues that

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:36.880
would give us two eigenvectors
that are basically,

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:37.660
they're rays.

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:39.940
The direction of the
trajectories on these two rays

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:41.580
would be toward
the critical point,

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:44.740
because we have, again,
negative eigenvalues.

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:50.190
And the trajectories then
would be following the lambda.

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:57.530
So if I, for example, pick
lambda_1 less than lambda_2,

00:07:57.530 --> 00:08:01.385
then I would have something
like this going to 0.

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:08.820
And we would have this
trajectory corresponding

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:11.130
to the eigenvalue
that is closer to 0.

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:15.560
And again, the
arrows would be going

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.340
toward this critical point.

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:19.670
So we can now move on.

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:25.130
And if we keep increasing
c, we reach now the point

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:26.970
4 where we are in
the special case,

00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:29.910
again, a boundary case
where the determinant is 0.

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:31.120
But the trace is non-zero.

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:33.630
If the determinant is 0, which
is the product of the two

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:36.059
eigenvalues, it means that
we have one eigenvalue that

00:08:36.059 --> 00:08:42.299
is equal to 0 and another
eigenvalue that is actually,

00:08:42.299 --> 00:08:44.920
in this case, minus
2, so just negative.

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:46.400
So what happens here?

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:50.690
What happens is that we
have now the eigenvector

00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:53.550
that corresponds to the
eigenvalue equals to 0

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:57.940
is basically just defining a
whole line of critical points.

00:08:57.940 --> 00:08:59.980
So all the points
on this line that

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:02.330
would correspond, so
for example, to lambda 0

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:03.530
are all critical points.

00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:05.830
So we don't need to
actually draw arrows here.

00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:07.700
All the points would
be critical points.

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:09.660
And another direction
or ray would

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:13.090
be determined by the second
eigenvalue, lambda_2.

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:19.877
And we would have, for example,
directions in this way.

00:09:19.877 --> 00:09:21.710
It would correspond to
the direction of v_2.

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:23.670
So all these would
be parallel to v_2.

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:28.800
And we would have
the trajectories

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:32.167
going toward all the
critical points on this line.

00:09:32.167 --> 00:09:34.250
So in this case, we're in
a case where we actually

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:36.240
don't have one
localized critical point

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:38.260
like in the previous
case that we saw.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.980
We've actually have a whole
line of critical points.

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:44.180
So let's move one
more point down.

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:47.550
So here, another
value of c, we now

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:49.840
are in the lower
part of the diagram

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:53.220
where we now have
two eigenvalues that

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:54.510
are again real.

00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:56.667
But now, the
determinant is negative.

00:09:56.667 --> 00:09:58.250
Determinant is the
product of the two.

00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:00.020
So basically we know
that one is positive

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:02.060
and the other one is negative.

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:11.980
So for example here, we
would have one positive,

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:13.990
the negative eigenvalue.

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:31.870
So we would have the
positive eigenvalue

00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:33.650
and the negative
eigenvalue here.

00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:37.680
So here, again, we're just
moving in the structure

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.520
of the critical point.

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:42.770
So we should have a smooth
transition between the diagrams

00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:44.160
going 1 to 5.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.320
And so here, what we
see is that we actually

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:51.990
have the ray that is basically
the stable space here

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:55.490
that would give us the
trajectories going to 0.

00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:58.776
But it's the only region
where we have stability.

00:10:58.776 --> 00:11:00.400
And all the trajectories
will just then

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:08.300
be tangent in minus
infinity to the ray v_1,

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:11.220
corresponding to the
negative eigenvalue,

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:14.880
and going towards the
direction of the ray

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:19.451
with a positive eigenvalue
at plus infinity.

00:11:19.451 --> 00:11:24.060
So we would have
something like that, that

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:25.420
would correspond to a saddle.

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:30.205
This would be a comb.

00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:39.160
This is basically a sink
or basically a stable node.

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:43.900
This would be
defective stable node.

00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:49.920
And here, we just have a
asymptotically stable spiral.

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:52.830
So basically here
what you could see

00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:54.950
is that we have,
by just changing

00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:59.740
the value of the constant
c, had moved the structure

00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:02.060
of the critical
point of the system

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:04.760
from the phase
diagrams one to five.

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:07.680
And the transitions can
be seen to be smooth

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:10.410
if you had a continuum
of values for c.

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:12.770
So that ends this recitation.
