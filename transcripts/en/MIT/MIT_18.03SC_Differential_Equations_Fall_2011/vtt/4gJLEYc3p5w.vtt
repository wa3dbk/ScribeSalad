00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.060
PROFESSOR: Welcome back.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.300
In this session, we're going to
tackle initial value problem y

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.510
dot plus t*y equals to t.

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:15.970
And this initial
value problem is

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:18.530
going to be subject to the
initial condition, y of 0

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:20.030
equals to 3.

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:26.760
We are going to use the
method of integration factor.

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:41.970
And what I want you to use
is both definite integrals

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:43.160
and indefinite integrals.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:52.866
So why don't you
take a few minutes

00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:53.990
to think about the problem?

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:55.730
And we will be right back.

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:02.280
Welcome back.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.850
So I hope that you worked out
the first part of the problem.

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.780
So what are we going to
do to solve this ODE?

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.180
First, we need to review what
is the method of integrating

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.200
factor.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.060
So when we use the
integrating factor,

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:23.980
basically, we're
trying to write down

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:30.110
our ODE in a different form
by introducing a function u.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.930
And the goal is to find
the function u such

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.181
that we can rewrite
this left-hand side

00:01:36.181 --> 00:01:40.130
as the derivative of
the product y dot u.

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.510
So in this case, if we're
looking at identifying

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:49.360
the function u that would
give us this form, y*u dot,

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.530
we need to just basically
identify that this is u dot.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.650
And from previous
sessions, we saw

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:06.540
that this would give us
classical solution that

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.730
involves an exponential of the
integral of the right-hand side

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:18.716
after dividing by u,
which gives us exponential

00:02:18.716 --> 00:02:20.980
of t squared over 2.

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.720
So integrating factor is
just using a trick so that we

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.270
simplify our left-hand side
and write it in the form

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.120
of the derivative
of the product, y*u.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.690
So now, we identified
our integration factor.

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:37.570
It's u equals exponential
of t squared over 2.

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.730
Now, we can go back
to our equation.

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.050
And I'm going to just
label it with a star here.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:48.120
So now, this equation
is written in this form.

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:54.340
t.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.630
and the integral of just
basically derivative, just

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:58.130
itself.

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.510
So if we use first the approach
of definite integrals--

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.260
actually, we're going
to switch the order,

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.240
and I'm going to start with
indefinite integrals first.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.030
So using indefinite
integrals, we'll

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.895
be integrating both sides.

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:25.420
And on the left-hand side, we
would just be left with y*u,

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.800
remembering that u is just
exponential of t squared over

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:28.460
2.

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:29.900
On the right-hand
side, we're just

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.307
integrating t exponential
of t squared over 2.

00:03:34.307 --> 00:03:36.890
And here, you can recognize that
the derivative of exponential

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.584
of t squared over 2 would
have a t in front of it.

00:03:39.584 --> 00:03:41.500
So this is actually a
very simple integration.

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.690
But we are in the case of
a differential equation

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.550
where we need a
constant of integration.

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:53.890
And again, here, we would
end up with two constants

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:55.119
of integration on both sides.

00:03:55.119 --> 00:03:57.660
But given that we are dealing
with a first-order differential

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.310
equation, we can regroup
that in one constant.

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.850
And then, we can just
find our solution

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.950
by dividing this equation by u.

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.020
And u, if you remember, is
just exponential of t squared

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.650
over 2, so it's
equivalent to multiplying

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.050
both sides by exponential
of minus t squared over 2.

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:19.430
So I'm just going
to write it down.

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.110
Then, it just gives
us exponential minus t

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.085
squared over 2 multiplied by
exponential t squared over 2,

00:04:32.085 --> 00:04:40.700
which is 1 and c exponential
of minus t squared over 2.

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:43.430
So that's our solution.

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.790
But remember that we're trying
to solve an initial value

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:48.340
problem they subject to
an initial condition.

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:53.800
And our initial
condition is y of 0

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.010
equals to 3, which
means that here, y of 0

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:00.060
would give us exponential to
0, which is just a constant.

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:05.830
So we end up with 3
equals to 1 plus c.

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:10.480
Therefore, c is equal to 2.

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:11.980
And the final form
of the solution

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.115
would just be 1
plus 2 exponential

00:05:14.115 --> 00:05:16.200
of minus t squared over 2.

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.180
So we started with the
indefinite integral.

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.070
So what if we would do this
using definite integrals?

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:35.760
So we don't need to
start from the beginning.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:39.580
We just need to take the
problem a few steps before

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:43.260
when we integrated both
sides of the equation.

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:50.107
And here, specify the
bounds of the integral.

00:05:50.107 --> 00:05:52.440
So how do we want to specify
the bounds of the integral?

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.640
We're given an initial condition
that is at t equals to 0.

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:58.370
So that's what we want here.

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:02.330
And we're integrating
to the variable t.

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.020
But one thing is
important when you

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.340
do that is that you have
the variable t that is

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:08.010
in the bounds of the integral.

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:11.120
So we want the
integrand to not be

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.800
written in terms of the
variable of integration.

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.410
So it is very
important to change

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:22.490
the label of your
variables in the integrand.

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:28.620
That's how you proceed
for different integrals.

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:35.110
So in this case then,
we end up with similar--

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:42.400
so u dot y evaluated at t
minus u dot y evaluated at 0.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.570
And from our initial
conditions and the form of u,

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:48.360
we know the value of this side,
of this term in the equation.

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.790
And here, we're just
again recognizing

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:54.580
that this is just the derivative
of exponential to s squared

00:06:54.580 --> 00:07:03.490
over 2 evaluated
between 0 and t.

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:06.480
So here, if I just carry
on with the right-hand side

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:09.460
and then go back to left-hand
side in the next step,

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:14.930
we would end up here with
just t squared over 2 minus 1.

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:17.060
Exponential of 0 is 1.

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:19.070
And now, let's deal with
this left-hand side.

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:26.510
So again, we end up with u*y
minus u dot y evaluated at 0.

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:30.650
However, u of 0 is
just the function

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:35.400
exponential to t squared over
2 evaluated at 0, which is 1.

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:39.910
And y of 0, we have it because
that was our initial condition,

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:42.340
and this is only 3.

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:47.230
So we have u*y minus 1 dot 3,
which is just basically minus

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:47.812
3.

00:07:47.812 --> 00:07:49.770
And on the right-hand
side, we have exponential

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:57.550
of t squared over 2 minus 1,
which gives us exponential

00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:01.070
of t squared over 2 minus 1.

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:03.670
Now bring in this minus
3 on the other side,

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:07.650
you now have a plus 3,
all of this multiplied

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:12.420
by 1 over u, which was our
exponential of minus t squared

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:14.240
over 2.

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:17.830
And therefore, we end up
with a similar solution

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:21.250
that we had for the indefinite
integral, 3 minus 1 is just 2.

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:30.600
So we have minus t
squared over 2 plus 1.

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:38.700
So using both the definite
integrals approach

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:41.559
and the indefinite integrals,
we recover the same results.

00:08:41.559 --> 00:08:43.610
And the main point
of this problem

00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:46.540
was really to practice
using the integration factor

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:48.740
and practice using
both approaches

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:51.110
with the definite and
indefinite integrals.

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:53.410
So this ends the problem.

00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:55.372
And I'll see you next time.
