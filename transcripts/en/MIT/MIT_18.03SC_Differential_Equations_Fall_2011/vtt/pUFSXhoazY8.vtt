00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:06.590
PROFESSOR: Welcome.

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:09.290
In this session, we're going
to examine pole diagrams.

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.000
So let's consider the pole
diagrams for the linear

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.270
time-independent systems
of the form p(D)y equals f.

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.245
So here, we have a
few pole diagrams

00:00:19.245 --> 00:00:22.580
to examine with the poles
marked with the red crosses.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.620
The axes are imaginary
axis and the real axis.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.030
And the questions are list
all the stable systems.

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:31.550
Choose the systems
with the fastest decay.

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.970
And last, choose fastest
decay without oscillation.

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.400
So you have to think of how
to interpret these diagrams

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.400
and what are the meanings of the
position of the different poles

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.810
to address these questions.

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:44.640
So pause the video.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.642
Take a few minutes.

00:00:45.642 --> 00:00:46.600
And I'll be right back.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.570
Welcome back.

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.160
So the first question asks us
to list all the stable systems.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.190
So if you recall, all
the stable systems

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.720
would be the ones for which
the real part of the pole

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:11.940
are all negative.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:18.490
So if we have all the poles
with real part negative,

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.210
we would have a stable
system for which

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.060
the solution after a long
time would decay, basically.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.320
It would be transient.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.700
So here, if we look
at our pole diagrams,

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.970
we have diagram B for which
the real part of the two poles

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.240
are minus 3 and minus 2.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.020
So this would
definitely generate

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.740
a decaying exponential,
exponential minus 2t,

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.780
exponential minus 3t type
function at large time

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.650
for this system.

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.310
In A, we have a minus 1 and a 1.

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.010
So the real part
here would give us

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.576
a decay, an exponential
decay, exponential minus t.

00:01:54.576 --> 00:01:56.200
But we would have
here a term that will

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.770
diverge with exponential t.

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.170
So this would have basically
behavior at long time

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.450
that diverges and
doesn't go to 0.

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.740
So this would not, basically,
be a stable system.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.970
For C, we have all the
real parts negative.

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.730
So we're in the stable case.

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.600
For D, we also have the same.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.110
All the real parts are negative.

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.620
So these are imaginary,
3i-- minus 2 plus 3i.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.540
So both of them have
also negative real parts.

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.290
Everything is on the
left side of the plane.

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.340
Same thing for E.
And for F, we're

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.700
right on the
imaginary axis, which

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.440
means that we can't
tell if it's going

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.370
to be an exponential--
it's not going

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.930
to be an exponential decay
or growth at this point.

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:48.870
So to answer the first
question, the stable systems

00:02:48.870 --> 00:03:02.110
would be B, C, D,
E, and that's it.

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.090
So now, for the second
part, choose the system

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.920
with the fastest decay.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.520
So here, again, as we just
saw, the real part of the poles

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.010
gives us the speed at which
the system is going to decay.

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.050
And so we have to
look for a system that

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:25.860
has its pole on the
rightmost part of the plane.

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.180
So for example, if we
restrict ourselves here,

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.620
the fastest decay here
is going to be governed

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.580
by the rightmost pole,
so exponential minus 2t,

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.290
that we need to examine.

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.820
Here, we have an exponential
minus 3t decay time.

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:44.320
Here, we would have an
exponential minus t decay.

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:49.870
Here, we would have something
a little bit-- minus 0.5t.

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.750
And here, again, this
is not stable system,

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.700
with a decay at large time.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.120
So which of the system
has the fastest decay?

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:03.070
We would need to select the one
with the rightmost pole that

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:05.810
is the most on the left.

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.620
So we would need to compare
this minus 2, with this minus 3,

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.860
with this minus 1,
with this minus 0.5.

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:19.430
And from all these poles, the
one that has the minus 3 here

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.410
would be the one that would
be decaying the fastest.

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:33.060
So we would have system C
decaying as exponential minus

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.120
3t.

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.000
And I'm going to just
write down the others.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.620
And these would be
the dominant terms

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.870
that would basically subscribe
the behavior at large t.

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:42.870
So this is the fastest.

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.730
For our system B, which
is not the fastest,

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:52.510
I'm just going to
write it, it's going

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.630
to be dominated by a minus 2t.

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:04.280
For the system D, it would
be dominated by a minus 1t.

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:12.650
For the system E, it would be
dominated by the minus 0.5t.

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:17.890
So the fastest decay would
definitely be system C.

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:20.780
So the last question,
choose the fastest decay

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:22.340
without oscillations.

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:26.570
So now, we need to pay attention
to whether the poles are

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:28.820
on the imaginary axis,
on the real axis,

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:30.870
or somewhere in the middle.

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.920
So let's again, examine
only the stable cases.

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.230
So here, the two poles
are in the real axis.

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:38.480
So it's going to give
us a behavior that

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:42.080
is only pure decay, exponential
decay, exponential minus

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.952
2t, exponential minus
3t, with no oscillation.

00:05:44.952 --> 00:05:46.410
Because basically,
these two people

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:48.230
don't have any imaginary parts.

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:51.530
Here, we have a term in
exponential minus 3t.

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:55.550
But we would have a term
that would show oscillations

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:58.130
with the circular
frequencies of 3.

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:01.620
So you would have an
exponential minus 3t cosine 3t

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:06.410
plus exponential minus
3t sine 3t, for example.

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:08.720
So here, we would have a
system that shows oscillation.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.530
So we don't want that.

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:12.480
For this case, that
would be similar.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:13.440
So you see the pattern.

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.400
Here, we have an
exponential decay.

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.720
Here, we would have
decaying oscillations.

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.500
So there is oscillations.

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:20.910
Same thing here.

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:25.220
And so we're left with only
system B, which basically

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:28.210
does not show any oscillation
but only an exponential decay.

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:35.495
Pure decay.

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:43.786
And it's dominated by
the exponential minus 2t

00:06:43.786 --> 00:06:44.660
without oscillations.

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:51.830
So that ends this first
part of the problem.

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:54.529
I'm just going to take
a minute and come back

00:06:54.529 --> 00:06:56.320
to show you the second
part of the problem.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:04.670
Welcome back for the
second part of the problem.

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:07.585
So here, another pole
diagram that we're going

00:07:07.585 --> 00:07:10.050
to label J for this system.

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:14.080
And the poles are
basically here,

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:17.940
0.5 plus 4i, 0.5 minus 4i.

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:20.330
And then here, we
have almost a minus 3.

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:23.690
And here, it would be a minus 4.

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:28.700
So the question is to consider
now the previous system we had,

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:32.590
p of D y equals f of t.

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:37.140
But now, with f of t equals
F_0 cos omega*t, and omega,

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:40.480
the circular frequency
going between 1 and 5.

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:44.010
And the question is for
which values of omega

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:49.000
do we have the largest
response from the system G?

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
So basically, we're looking
at phenomenon of resonance

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.140
where we want to
find the frequency

00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:57.350
omega for which the
response of the system

00:07:57.350 --> 00:08:00.150
is going to be the biggest.

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:01.840
So I give you just
a few minutes,

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:03.040
and we'll be right back.

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:13.980
Welcome back for
this second part.

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:19.040
So here, if you recall,
the amplitude response from

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:24.060
the previous recitations, the
amplitude is governed by 1 over

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:26.640
the characteristic polynomial
evaluated at i*omega.

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:27.927
Where does i omega come from?

00:08:27.927 --> 00:08:30.510
If you recall, it comes from the
exponential response formula.

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:34.409
Because on the right-hand side
here, we have a cosine omega*t,

00:08:34.409 --> 00:08:38.299
then we complexify, exponential
i*omega*t, et cetera,

00:08:38.299 --> 00:08:40.530
to get the amplitude response.

00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:44.540
So the amplitude is going to
be the largest for basically

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:47.950
values of i*omega that are
the closest to the poles

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:53.640
of the polynomial-- to the
poles of this function.

00:08:56.300 --> 00:09:00.500
Basically, the poles of the 1
over characteristic polynomial

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:04.660
is going to give
us the 1 over 0,

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:07.400
which will give an amplitude
response that goes to infinity,

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:09.420
so the largest response.

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:12.280
So we want to choose
our frequency, i*omega.

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:14.320
Basically, we want to
look at this diagram

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:19.665
and look at the poles that are
the closest to the values that

00:09:19.665 --> 00:09:22.100
are going to give us
p of s equals to 0.

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:24.560
And this is basically
diagram that gives us

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.630
the pole of this 1 over p.

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:30.630
And so we want to choose
a value for i*omega,

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:32.580
which will be on
the imaginary axis,

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:35.830
that is the closest to
one of these two poles.

00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:40.590
Given that we work with positive
frequencies, we would want,

00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:46.460
for example, to choose
i*omega equals i*4.

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:51.040
So it would be here, or
just omega equals to 4.

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:53.130
And this value of
omega would get

00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:56.330
us very close to this
pole, which would mean then

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:59.120
that we are 1 over a
very small number, which

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:01.790
means that the amplitude
response will be the biggest.

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:05.350
So that's the idea--
look behind the resonance

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:08.050
and looking at,
again, the phenomenon

00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:11.120
of the resonance from the
pole diagram perspective

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:15.480
and with the idea of the
use of the Laplace transform

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.810
behind the whole technique.

00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:19.360
So that ends this session.

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:22.860
And the goal was really
to learn to interpret

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:25.180
the meaning of the poles
in the pole diagram

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:28.190
and how do the polls
give us an idea

00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:31.800
and insight on the behavior of
the system in the long term.
