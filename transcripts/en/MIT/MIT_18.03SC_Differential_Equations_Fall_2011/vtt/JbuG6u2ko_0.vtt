00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.760
PROFESSOR: Convolution
is a tricky concept

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.420
and hard to understand.

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:06.800
But it gives so much
insight that it's worthwhile

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.710
coming to grips with it.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:10.840
The Convolution:
Accumulation mathlet

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.710
provides one perspective on
the convolution integral.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:18.080
I'll explain the
applet using a story.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.890
There's a lake in Iowa with
a stream running into it

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.000
and a stream running out of it.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.560
Farm runoff puts
phosphate into the lake.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.150
The rate of deposition of the
phosphate varies over the year.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.550
Most in the summer, none
in the dead of winter.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.330
Suppose the farm is new
and that t equals 0,

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.550
there is no phosphate
in the lake.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.780
This is called rest
initial conditions.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.980
The question is, how
much phosphate is there

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.860
in the lake at some
later time, say t.

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.290
This will be an accumulation
of contributions from earlier

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.770
times, but the
earlier contributions

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.650
will have decayed
somewhat by time t.

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.710
We can visualize this process
using the Convolution:

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.780
Accumulation mathlet.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.100
I'll set it up to model
what we're looking at.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.010
The signal f of t is the
rate of input of phosphate

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:14.290
into the lake.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:20.260
And I will model it by the menu
item f of t is 1 plus cosine

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:21.810
b*t.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.765
You can see it drawn in the
lower graphing window here.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.700
A certain proportion of
the phosphate in the lake

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.200
leaves it during
each unit of time.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.710
This results in an exponential
decay of each contribution.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.690
This decay profile is called the
weight function, denoted here

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.390
by g of t.

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.755
And I will select
the weight function,

00:01:48.755 --> 00:01:52.320
giving exponential decay
e to the minus a*t.

00:01:56.082 --> 00:01:57.540
Now let's see what
happens if I let

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.620
a small amount of time elapse.

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:00.990
How small?

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.630
Well I can select that
by picking the step size.

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.479
And I will select a
step size of one eighth.

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.810
So now let's let a little
bit of time elapse.

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:17.060
Say, amount of
time of one eighth.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.650
If I click on the time slider at
one eighth, I get this picture.

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.570
t equals 0 happens to
occur at mid-summer,

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.980
so that the signal
has a value of 2

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.090
in kilograms per unit time.

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:35.780
This phosphate decays away
as water comes into the lake

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.360
and carries it off according
to the weight function.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.927
And this is indicated by the
exponential decay function

00:02:41.927 --> 00:02:43.010
here in the bottom window.

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.940
The weight function is a rate.

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.540
It needs to get multiplied
by the step size

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.450
before it gives an actual
amount of phosphate in the lake.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.270
The step size is one
eighth, and the product

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.980
is the signal, the
value of the signal at t

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.840
equals 0, that's 2, times
the weight function, that's

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:12.360
the exponential decay, times the
step size, which is one eighth.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.010
So that gives all
together one quarter

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.380
times that exponential decay.

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.090
And you see that drawn in
the top graphing window here,

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.480
the value near t
equals 0 is a quarter

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.880
and it decays away
exponentially.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.370
Now let's move on to
the next time interval.

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:36.450
I'll click here, and
you see what happens.

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.970
The signal is now
a little bit less

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.180
and the time is a
little bit later.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.580
So the weight function is
scaled and shifted a little bit

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.980
differently in this
bottom graphing window.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.620
It gets multiplied by the
step size one eighth again,

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.690
and laid down on top of
the graph of the phosphate

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.450
arising from the
first time interval.

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.870
So the sum of those
two is a record

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.610
of the phosphate in the lake
arising from these first two

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:14.070
time intervals as it
decays away in later time.

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:16.050
This process continues.

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:19.060
You can see the next few
steps by clicking them up.

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.490
Here's the effect of
the third time interval

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:25.190
as it decays away, but laid
down on top of the preceding

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:29.530
contributions to
the lake, and so on.

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.070
Or I can animate
the entire process

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.925
and watch the thing
evolve as time increases.

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.470
So you can see, the
effect is a steady state

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:53.210
is reached after a while, you
get a sinusoidal total amount

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.950
of phosphate in the lake.

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:00.040
It's delayed a little
bit from the peak.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.286
The maximum amount of
phosphate in the lake

00:05:02.286 --> 00:05:03.660
occurs a little
after mid-summer.

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:10.820
Now imagine shrinking
the step size.

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:14.340
In the limit, as the
step size goes to 0,

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.940
this process is described
by the convolution integral.

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:22.970
At time t, all the contributions
from time 0 to time t

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:24.560
are present.

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.800
And so we're going to take an
integral from u equals 0 to u

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.230
equals t.

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:35.650
The contribution from time u
decays by the factor of g of t

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:39.970
minus u by time t.

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:45.930
So the contribution from between
time u and time u plus du

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:51.690
is given by the product f of u,
the signal of time u, times g

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:54.700
of t minus u, the weight
function evaluated

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:57.010
at t minus u, times du.

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:01.720
And the integral of
this differential,

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.790
from u equals 0
to u equals t, is

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:07.570
the amount of phosphate
in the lake at time t.

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:11.810
And it's given by the
convolution integral.

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:14.820
This system is modeled by
a differential equation,

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:20.600
namely dx/dt plus
a*x equals f of t.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:26.940
The weight function of the
operator dx/dt plus a*x is e

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:29.290
to the minus a*t.

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:31.400
And the solution to the
differential equation

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.220
with rest initial
conditions is given

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:36.290
by the convolution integral
of the input signal

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:38.260
with the weight function.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.740
This statement is a general
fact for LTI operators,

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.590
not just first-order operators.
