00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.029
PROFESSOR: Welcome to this
session on separable equations.

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:11.000
So in this problem, you're
asked in the first question

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.920
to solve the initial
value problem

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.150
dy/dx equals y square with the
initial condition y of zero

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.024
equals 1.

00:00:19.024 --> 00:00:20.440
In the second part
of the problem,

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.290
you're asked to find
the general solution

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:24.620
where no initial
condition is imposed.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.890
So here you need to remember
your method of separation

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.980
of variables to tackle
the first question.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.369
And then in the second
part of the problem,

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.300
remember all the types of
solutions and conditions

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.230
that you applied the first part
to recover the lost solutions.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.720
So why don't you take a
minute, pause the video,

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.570
work through questions a and b.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.990
And then we'll continue
together when I come back.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.470
Welcome back.

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.250
So in the first
part of the problem,

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.350
we'll be solving the equation
dy/dx equals y squared.

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.780
So here the method of
separation of variables

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.630
tells us that we should regroup
the variables of the same kind,

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.480
so all the y variables on
one side and dx variable

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.300
on the other side
of the equation

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.500
and then integrate
from this point.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.030
So here for this step,
notice that I divided by y

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.940
squared, which
means that we need

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.080
to impose the condition y not
equal to zero from now on.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.910
So from this step, we just
use indefinite integrals

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:44.030
to integrate both
sides of the equation.

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.310
So the left-hand side is the
integral dy over y squared.

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.380
So integral of this
gives us minus 1 over y.

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.820
And the right-hand side,
integral dx, is just x.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.465
Both sides would give us
constant of integrations,

00:02:00.465 --> 00:02:02.610
but we only need
one because this

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.640
is a first-order
differential equation.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.850
And so we group them together
on the right-hand side

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:07.670
with constant c.

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.800
So from this point, given that
we're interested in variable y,

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.045
we need just to
invert the expression.

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.880
And that gives us
partial answer,

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.190
which is y of x equals
minus 1 over x plus c.

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.110
So now we need to use our
initial condition, y of zero

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.860
equals to 1, to
determine the value

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.100
of c for this particular
initial value problem.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:55.700
So our initial condition
was y of zero equals 1.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.630
So if we substitute
this in the expression

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:03.780
that we just
obtained, we just have

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:11.480
zero plus c, which then
only gives us c equal to 1.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.150
So we end up with the value for
our constant of integration,

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.570
c equals minus 1.

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:27.440
And so the solution
to this problem is

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.290
y of x equals 1 over 1 minus x.

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.090
So if you examine
this expression,

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.340
you see right away that
we have a problem for x

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.390
equals to 1 because
at x equals to 1,

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.440
we have 1 over 0 which means
that, then, the solution blows

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.210
up and we have a
vertical asymptote.

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:45.775
So let me draw this here.

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:58.830
So we're going to have
an asymptote at x equals

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:08.010
1 and a solution that passes
through our initial condition,

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:13.670
y equals 1, going to infinity
when approaching x equals 1.

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:18.070
But then on the right side
of the value x equals 1,

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.339
we have another part of
the solution that goes

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:23.610
to zero as x goes to infinity.

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.300
And that diverges to minus
infinity when x approaches 1.

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.240
So by convention, the solutions
of differential equations

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.150
are defined on one
single interval.

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:39.600
So we need here to realize
that the solution we had

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.140
is basically two
parts, the parts

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:43.950
on the left of the
asymptote and the part

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:45.350
on the right of the asymptote.

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:03.960
So the solution to
our initial value

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.680
problems needs to
be the solution that

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.290
passes through the imposed
initial condition, which

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:10.270
was y of zero equals to 1.

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.615
So it needs to be this solution.

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:23.170
So now, if we move on to the
solution of the second part

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:26.770
of the problem, b, we were asked
to find the general solution

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:29.750
of the problem, which means
that we need to account now

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:31.460
for all the
solutions, regardless

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:32.910
of their initial condition.

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:35.270
So we already answered
this partially

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:38.260
during the solution
of part a where

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.550
we solved using
indefinite integrals

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:46.410
and arrived to the
solution minus 1

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:48.540
over x plus c,
where here we had,

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:51.420
basically, an undetermined
constant of integration.

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:54.010
So this is one general solution.

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:57.250
But remember that
we need to give all

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:58.790
the solutions of the problem.

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:00.760
So when we arrived
at the solution,

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.760
we excluded the
solution y equals

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.530
zero, which was basically
a lost solution because we

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:10.870
had to impose the condition
y not equal to zero.

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:15.310
So we need, when we give
the general solution

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:20.010
to this differential equation,
to recover the lost solution.

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:23.720
And then we basically have
one kind of solution, minus 1

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.560
over x plus c, that
excludes y equals to zero

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.020
and another kind
of solution that

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:30.760
is simply the zero solution.

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:33.280
So to summarize,
the important points

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:35.820
of this problem is to remember
the separation of variables

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:40.660
and how to use it and
the fact that using it

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:44.544
imposes conditions that require
us to recover lost solutions

00:06:44.544 --> 00:06:45.960
at the end of the
problem if we're

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.210
asked to give general solution.

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:51.810
Another point to remember
is that even a simple ODE

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:54.814
can lead to relatively
complex behavior which

00:06:54.814 --> 00:06:56.730
drives the presence of
this vertical asymptote

00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:00.330
that you need to then know
how to deal with and determine

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:02.890
which part of the solutions
that you've obtained

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:05.180
is the real solution to
the initial value problem

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:06.610
that you're given.

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:12.520
So I hope that you are
OK with this problem

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:16.040
and you will use these
approaches many times

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:17.750
for the rest of the course.
