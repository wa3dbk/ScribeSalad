00:00:05.784 --> 00:00:06.760
PROFESSOR: Hi.

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.770
Today we'll explore the complex
numbers and Euler formula.

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:11.670
So the first part
of the problem is

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.110
to write this complex number,
minus 2 plus 3i, in polar form.

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.242
And at this point, it's written
in rectangular coordinate form.

00:00:20.242 --> 00:00:22.200
The second question asks
you to do the reverse,

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.680
to write three exponential to
the i*pi over 6 in rectangular

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.390
coordinate form.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.080
Question c asks you to
draw and label the triangle

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.200
relating the
rectangular coordinates

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.310
to the polar coordinate form.

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.760
D asks you to compute 1 over
this reverse complex number

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.670
that we already
saw in question a.

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.590
And e asks you to find
the cube root of 1.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.030
And in all these questions,
you'll be using Euler formula.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.450
So why don't you
pause the video,

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:51.387
take a few minutes to
work out the problem,

00:00:51.387 --> 00:00:52.220
and we'll come back.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.060
Welcome back.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.660
So we're asked
throughout the problem

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.200
to go back and forth between
coordinates in polar form

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.850
and in rectangular form.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:18.220
So a key thing to remember is
Euler formula from the start.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.542
So we're just going
to write it up here.

00:01:25.352 --> 00:01:27.900
It allows us to express
a complex exponential

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.250
into the sum of its
cosine plus i sine theta.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.660
So how do we tackle question a?

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:42.460
Question a gives us a complex
number in rectangular form.

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.840
So in this form, a plus i*b.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:52.930
And we're asked to write
it in polar form, which

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.460
introduces the modulus of the
complex number r and its phase

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.470
theta.

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.895
So r, the modulus of
the complex number

00:02:01.895 --> 00:02:06.810
that we can compute when we
know its rectangular form,

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.230
with its real form squared
plus imaginary part squared,

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.660
the whole thing under the root.

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.570
So in this case,
we have 4 plus 9.

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.360
So we end up with root
of 13 for the modulus

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.230
of the complex number z.

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.070
So now for the phase.

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.510
Using Euler formula,
we can see that we

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.660
can relate the rectangular
form to the polar form

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:44.270
by just introducing--
I'm going to keep r.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.080
And you can see now
that we can extract

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.050
the sine and the cosine
of the angle theta

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.090
and relate that to a ratio of a.

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.010
And the modulus r
that we just found,

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.700
b modulus r that we just found.

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:09.540
Or in one move, just express
it as the tangent of the angle

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.770
theta, just sine
over the cosine,

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:22.250
just becomes basically b
over a, which we have here.

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.430
So we have the modulus r,
which is now root of 13,

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.930
and the angle theta
that we can now

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:42.560
extract by using the
reverse of the function tan.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.560
So just before we move
to the next question,

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.990
this is not one of the classical
angles that you learned.

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:54.290
So just to have an idea
of where this angle lies

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.500
on the trigonometric
unit circle,

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.020
just recall here that
the sine is positive

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:04.310
and the cosine of this
angle is negative.

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:13.560
So we're bound to be in this
region, where basically theta

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.260
is between pi and pi over 2.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.244
And that's the
answer to question a.

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.210
So now for question b, we're
asked to do the reverse,

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:35.980
expressing the polar number
3 i*pi over 6 in rectangular

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:37.020
coordinates.

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.660
So now this is just a
straightforward application

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.810
of the Euler formula
that we just saw.

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.540
By just expanding
the exponential,

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:46.700
as I already wrote there.

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:59.080
Plus i 3 sine pi over 6.

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:03.810
And on the same
trigonometric circle

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:10.720
here, that's roughly
where pi over 6 lie.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:20.490
And you can just re-express this
as 3 root of 3 over 2, plus i 3

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:21.820
over 2.

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:26.390
So that ends the
solution for question b.

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:27.570
So now question c.

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:35.350
Let me just add a line here.

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:38.430
Question c we're asked
to draw and label

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.770
the triangle relating
rectangular to polar

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:42.690
coordinates.

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:47.810
So that's what we already had
a sense with when we wrote this

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:54.090
formula going from a plus i*b
to r exponential of i*theta.

00:05:54.090 --> 00:06:02.950
So in the complex plane,
we have the real axis,

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:09.790
an imaginary axis,
and a complex number

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:16.134
lying on this plane
written in this form

00:06:16.134 --> 00:06:17.300
in a rectangular coordinate.

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:25.420
You'd have a projection of a
in the real axis, projection

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:29.130
of value b on the
imaginary axis.

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:35.740
And in polar form this
would be its modulus

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:42.010
or distance from the origin,
and its phase theta that

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:44.680
would come in the polar form.

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:52.030
So that's the
triangle that allows

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:55.420
us to go back and forth between
the rectangular and polar

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:57.090
coordinates.

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:02.800
So to almost finish,
question d now

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:06.880
asks us to compute the reverse
of the original complex number

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:07.600
that we used.

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:15.710
So 1 over minus 2 plus 3i.

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:20.000
So to do this, we can
stay in rectangular form

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.880
and basically multiply the
numerator and denominator

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.530
by the complex
conjugate of the number.

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:26.610
But clearly now
that we learned how

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:31.120
to use polar coordinate
expressions of this number,

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:34.750
it's much easier to just write
it directly in this form.

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:49.310
In one step we basically
arrived to the results,

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:58.900
where we express that the angle
was the reverse tan of minus 3

00:07:58.900 --> 00:07:59.530
over 2.

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:01.600
And that's done.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:08.010
So now are for
the last question,

00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:13.400
we were asked to compute
the one third root of 1.

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:16.260
So basically, 1 to the 1/3.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:20.310
So here, obviously, we're
treating 1 as a complex number.

00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:26.830
And if we go in
the complex plane

00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:29.900
and I just introduce
here the number 1,

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:32.424
we see that in polar
form 1 is just basically

00:08:32.424 --> 00:08:38.919
a complex number with modulus
1, and angle 0, modulo 2pi.

00:08:38.919 --> 00:08:50.140
So we can write 1 as
exponential 2n*pi,

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:52.450
because it's basically
angle 0 modulus 2pi.

00:08:55.330 --> 00:09:00.830
And from here we know that
we're looking at third roots,

00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:03.240
so we're going to
have three roots.

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:04.960
And these roots are
going to be expressed

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:08.690
by changing the value of n.

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:11.890
First one, n equals
to 0 is just going

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:15.710
to give us back root
of 1, because we're

00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:18.260
going to have exponential
to 0 is just 1.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.950
Power of 1/3 is just 1.

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:25.490
n equals to 1.

00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:28.180
We are going to have
exponential of 2pi

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:40.360
over 3, which we can express,
again using the Euler formula,

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:42.180
also in coordinate form.

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:49.430
And then just write
down the values.

00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:57.720
And for the third root we
take the value n equals to 2,

00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:13.560
so we have i*4pi over 3,
which again we can express

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:16.790
as the cosine plus the
sine of 4pi over 3.

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:19.150
So where do these roots lie?

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:22.440
So we have root 1
for n equals to 0.

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:27.130
The second root, exponential 2pi
over 3, basically in polar form

00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:32.170
would be here, where we would
have the angle 2pi over 3.

00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:35.500
So 1pi over 3 would here.

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:37.140
2pi over 3 would be here.

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:38.380
3pi over 3 would be here.

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:41.730
And 4pi over 3 is our third
root, it would be here.

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:54.920
So then we can just
write down the values.

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:57.030
And you can do that when
you know the angles,

00:10:57.030 --> 00:11:00.910
or just keep it in either form
when you don't know directly

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:02.650
the expression for the angles.

00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:05.785
So this completes the problems.

00:11:05.785 --> 00:11:08.310
In all of these problems
what we kept using

00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:11.900
is Euler formula to go back
and forth between coordinate

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:14.610
in rectangular
form to expression

00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:16.450
of complex number in polar form.

00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:18.840
And that's the key formula
that we kept using.

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:21.460
And you'll be using
this repeatedly when

00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:23.770
we will be solving
other ODEs for which we

00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:27.030
can use complex number
as a trick for solutions.

00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:29.398
And this ends this session.
