00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.280
PROFESSOR: Hi, everyone.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.570
Welcome back.

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.900
So today we're going to take
a look at solving differential

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.920
equations using the
Laplace transforms,

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.280
and the problem we're going to
take a look at is a simple ODE,

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:24.170
x-dot plus 2x equals
3 delta of t plus 5,

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.770
as a forcing on the
right hand side.

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.060
We're going to look at having
rest initial conditions,

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.612
x of 0 minus is
equal to 0, and we're

00:00:31.612 --> 00:00:34.070
asked to use Laplace transforms
to solve this initial value

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:35.630
problem.

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.240
For part B, we're asked
to have the initial value

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.790
problem without any
delta function forcing

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.760
on the right-hand side to give
an equivalent initial value

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.570
problem without a delta function
forcing on the right-hand side,

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.050
but yields the same
solution as in part A.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.960
And then in question
two, we're asked

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.140
to solve the
second-order differential

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.390
equation, x-dot-dot
plus 9x equals u of t

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.150
with rest initial conditions,
so x of 0 minus is 0,

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.370
x-dot of 0 minus is also 0.

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.010
So I'll let you work
on this problem,

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:08.218
and I'll be back in a moment.

00:01:18.548 --> 00:01:19.620
Hi, everyone.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.350
Welcome back.

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.900
OK, so for part
A, the first step

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.510
is to Laplace transform
both sides of the equation.

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:32.640
So we take the Laplace
transform of x-dot plus 2x,

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.640
and that's going to be equal
to the Laplace transform of 3

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.850
delta of t plus 5.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.270
And we can use the distribution
properties of the Laplace

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.270
transform, so this is going to
be Laplace transform of x-dot

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.540
plus 2 times the
Laplace transform of x.

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.410
On the right-hand side, we have
3 times the Laplace transform

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:04.440
of the delta function plus 5
times the Laplace transform

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.940
of 1.

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:15.040
Now, we can replace the
Laplace transform of x-dot

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.430
if we use the identity with
s times the Laplace transform

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.570
of x minus x at 0 minus.

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.450
And we're told that x
of 0 minus in this case

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.130
is just 0, so this
term's going to vanish.

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.910
And just for brevity,
I'm going to write X of s

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.190
as the Laplace transform of x.

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.640
So we now have s
times X of s plus 2 X

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.550
of s equals, and on
the right-hand side,

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.600
we have three times
the Laplace transform

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.280
of the delta function.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.470
Laplace transform of the
delta function is just 1,

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.510
so we have 3 plus 5, and
the Laplace transform of 1

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:00.510
is just 1 over s.

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.340
So I can now factor
the left-hand side,

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:18.110
and I get X of s times s plus
2 equals 3 plus 5 over s.

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.620
And note how, when we
have X of s multiplied

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.370
by some polynomial
in s, this is always

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.830
going to be the
characteristic polynomial.

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.530
So if we look back, s plus 2 is
the characteristic polynomial

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:29.925
of x-dot plus 2x.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:42.150
So this yields 3 divided by s
plus 2, on the right-hand side,

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:48.740
plus 5 divided by
s times s plus 2.

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:52.570
And for the second piece,
we can use partial fractions

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:56.470
to decompose it
into a term times s

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.810
and a term times s plus 2.

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:11.350
And when we do that, we end up
getting 5/2 1 over s minus 1

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:12.120
over s plus 2.

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:22.920
So I can combine the 3 divided
by s plus 2 with the minus 5/2

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.550
divided by s plus
2 into one term.

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:37.930
So this gives you 1/2 1 over s
plus 2, and we also have 5/2 1

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.630
over s.

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.720
And now we just take the
inverse Laplace transform

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.940
of both sides.

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:50.490
So on the left-hand side, we
recover x of t, so we get 1/2 e

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:55.200
to the minus 2t plus 5/2.

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.230
The inverse Laplace
transform of 1/s is just 1.

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:09.190
So we end up with x of t is
1/2 e to minus 2t plus 5/2,

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:13.200
and this solution is
valid for t bigger than 0.

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.050
Sometimes, people write
it as this quantity

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.940
multiplied by step function.

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:25.180
And x of t is also 0 for t
less than 0, for example.

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:33.890
And it's just useful to quickly
sketch what x of t looks like,

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:38.010
so it's an exponential
decay for t bigger than 0,

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:41.930
and it's flat for t less than 0.

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:44.053
So here's our x of t.

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:52.220
So for part B, now, we're asked
to find a differential equation

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:56.970
and new initial conditions that
reproduce the solution offered

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:58.970
t bigger than 0.

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:05.080
So note how we'd be looking
for a new solution, x of t,

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.090
which would be an
exponential decay.

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:10.620
And essentially, we
just grow, so we're

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:18.230
looking at initial
conditions, which start at 0.

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:21.670
If I were to write the original
differential equation-- so this

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:25.940
is the original differential
equation from part

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:31.500
A. Looks like this.

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:34.830
And just quickly to note
that x-dot near the origin

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:37.890
is going to be approximately e
times the delta function, which

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:40.790
means in the original
differential equation,

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:45.880
x is going to have a jump
of 3 about the origin.

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:51.460
So the new initial
value problem--

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:53.380
well, we don't want
the delta function

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:58.290
on the right-hand side, so we're
going to solve x-dot plus 2x

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:00.390
is equal to 5.

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:02.520
But what initial
conditions do we need?

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:10.430
Well, we need x of
0 minus to now be 3.

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:15.250
So when we eliminate the 3
delta on the right-hand side,

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:18.670
we have to introduce new initial
conditions so that the solution

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:21.380
agrees for t bigger than 0.

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:27.020
OK, so this concludes part one.

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:32.520
For part two, we're asked
to solve a new differential

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:42.314
equation, x-dot-dot
plus 9x equals u of t,

00:07:42.314 --> 00:07:44.730
and we're just going to follow
the same procedure where we

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:48.130
Laplace transform both sides.

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:50.260
So Laplace transforming
the left-hand side gives me

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:57.160
x-dot-dot plus 9x equals the
Laplace transform of u of t.

00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:04.060
And again, I can use
the formula which

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:08.230
relates derivatives of x
back to the Laplace transform

00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:14.840
of x, and so in this case, the
Laplace transform of x-dot-dot

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:20.130
is going to be s squared times
the Laplace transform of x.

00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:22.850
And then I'm going to
have plus a term which

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:25.750
involves x of 0 minus
and a term which

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:28.000
involves x-dot of 0 minus.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.300
And if your initial
conditions were not 0,

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:32.070
you would have to
keep these terms in.

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:33.919
However in our case,
these terms are

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:36.919
both 0 because we deal with
rest initial conditions,

00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:40.400
I'm just not going
to write them.

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:47.390
Plus 9 X of s equals-- the
Laplace transform of u of t

00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:47.980
is 1/s.

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:57.410
So again, we have X of s s
squared plus 9-- so note again

00:08:57.410 --> 00:08:59.920
how this is the same
characteristic polynomial

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:03.220
as in our differential
equation-- is equal to 1/s.

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:12.930
So X of s is 1/s
s squared plus 9,

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:14.690
which we can use
partial fractions, now,

00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:22.075
to decompose it into A over s
plus B*s plus C divided by s

00:09:22.075 --> 00:09:24.980
squared plus 9.

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:32.180
And if I were to take a look at
my notes, I have, in this case,

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:41.170
A is 1/9, B is negative
1/9, and C is equal to 0,

00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:44.470
if you were to work
out these coefficients.

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:58.920
So what this means is X of s
is 1/9 1 over s minus 1/9 1

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:01.400
over s squared plus 9.

00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:15.370
And when we invert the Laplace
transform, the inverse of 1/s

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:18.790
is just 1, so x of
t becomes 1 over 9.

00:10:21.645 --> 00:10:25.390
Sorry, this should be s up here.

00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:27.390
The inverse Laplace
transform of s divided by s

00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:31.390
squared plus 9 is
cosine 3, so we end up

00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:37.760
with negative 1/9 cosine
of 3t, and again, this

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:41.770
is a solution for
t bigger than 0.

00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:45.610
So as soon as we turn on the
input, the function x of t

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:48.220
starts growing
continuously from 1,

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:50.665
and then achieves an
oscillation with period 3.

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:55.870
So just to quickly
recap, in this problem,

00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:59.650
we solved several ODEs,
several initial value problem

00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:02.492
ODEs using Laplace transforms.

00:11:02.492 --> 00:11:04.700
Laplace transforms are
particularly nice because they

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:07.810
convert an ODE into an
algebraic equation, which

00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:09.970
we can solve fairly easily.

00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:11.450
The drawback is
we sometimes have

00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:13.390
to manipulate, using
partial fractions,

00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:15.490
the right-hand
side into functions

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:19.940
that we know how to invert using
the Laplace transform inverse.

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:23.400
So I'll just conclude here,
and I'll see you next time.
