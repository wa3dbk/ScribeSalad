00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.530
PROFESSOR: So let's
go ahead and start

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.260
Lecture 6, which is
all about strategy.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.900
And we're going to try
to be numerical about it

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.310
because numbers
make us feel smart.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:40.230
So strategy is a nebulous thing.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.760
It can't be easily defined,
and very many people

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.190
spend all day talking
about it without giving

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.630
any statistics or
numerical results.

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.810
Which I think is quite a
shame because, especially

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:56.020
in this Battlecode,
we can actually

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.630
do computations and say, OK,
if I build this many of x,

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.890
I can build this many of y.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.300
And we can get to some
pretty interesting results.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.770
I'm going to start out by
just having a seat here,

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.160
and I'm going to talk about
some sort of general stuff.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.820
And then we'll move straight
into numerical strategy, which

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.120
I've got here on the
right of the view screen.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.710
And you can see, like,
I've implemented Battlecode

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.730
in Mathematica to
a limited extent

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:26.114
for the express purpose of
showing graphs like these.

00:01:26.114 --> 00:01:27.030
So we'll get to those.

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.550
Let's talk about
Battlecode a little bit.

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.830
The way I see it
is that strategy

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.950
can be expressed as having
a triangle aspect to it

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.180
because you're basically
picking between a technology

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:46.190
route, an econ route,
and a military route.

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.510
And then among military, I like
to try to draw another line.

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.890
And you can sort of imagine this
triangle as being on a plane.

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.780
This is on a plane that's like
perpendicular to this line,

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.890
indicating that you can
sort of be in any of them.

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.450
I could have drawn it
as a triangular prism,

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.860
but I chose not to.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.840
So then this
triangle, you can have

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.980
a defensive military
strategy, or you

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.280
can have an offensive one.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.920
Offensive is spelled that way.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.660
And I also like to populate
this map with even more things

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.770
to make it less clear
what's going on.

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.050
So I'm going to put
over here large map,

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.460
and I'm going to put
over down here small map.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.450
Because if you're
on a small map,

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.920
you want to have more
military, at least early on.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.660
I mean, this is
all time-changing.

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.086
So you could describe a
strategy in time as being like,

00:02:38.086 --> 00:02:39.960
OK, first, I'm going to
do a lot of military,

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.619
and then I'm going
to get some econ,

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:42.910
and then I'm going to get tech.

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.060
So like that's a strategy,
though it looks pretty weird.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.560
That looks pretty weird, and
it's crossing out my small map.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.400
Anyway, so small
map, it is really

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.600
another way of saying
it's far to the enemy base

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.459
or it's close.

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.750
So on a small map, you can
get right to the enemy base.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.255
You got to be prepared if
they've got a rush strategy.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.550
Maybe what you ought to
do instead of saying,

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.960
OK, I'm going to use
the map size, is do

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.140
sort of a heuristic.

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.850
Because you could
imagine this map--

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.340
I'm going to do
example maps here--

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.320
and this map
currently identical.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.040
Now let's make them different.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.020
This one's got
like tons of mines,

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.800
and this one has a
little bit of mines.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.150
Obviously, they're different.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.760
I mean, if the headquarters
are here and here in these two

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.670
maps, well, this one is
effectively a small map,

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.600
and this one is
effectively a large map.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.250
So here's a suggestion.

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.060
It's not very expensive to
sense mines at location.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.190
It costs 10 in the
MethodCosts.txt file.

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.380
So you could consider
saying, all right,

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:49.680
I'm this headquarters.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.190
For the first couple
of rounds, I'm

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.060
going to compute the sum of
the number of mines between me

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.240
and the enemy in sort of a
volume looking like that.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.790
And so I'm just going
to compute this number,

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.310
just going to total it all up.

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:08.615
If the map is, say, 50 by
50, then how many tiles

00:04:08.615 --> 00:04:09.600
do you need to count?

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.720
Well, say you make it 4
wide, just for halibut.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.240
And then down in
this direction, I

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.529
guess it would end up
being sort of like 50.

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:23.880
So you'd have about 200
tiles to look at times 10.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.880
That's going to be 10
bytecodes per sense tile,

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.550
and so you've only got 2,000.

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.520
You can do that
easily in one turn

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.740
because the bytecode
limit is 10,000.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.410
So then you could very
quickly get an estimate

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.810
of how easy or difficult
it is to get to your enemy

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:39.740
right off there.

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.860
And so then you
could find your spot,

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.290
say, OK, I'm here or
here on my Tech Tree.

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:49.690
The system doesn't have to
be incredibly complicated.

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.080
So let's delete
some of this mess

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.820
that I've made
here so that I can

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.340
make some notes
about the differences

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.400
between defensive and
offensive strategy.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.350
Later on, we're going to
see the number of units

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:08.250
that you can get if you're
pushing for an early advantage,

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.980
and that's going to
sort of tie into this.

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.250
So there's a time
aspect, where you're

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:17.410
saying, if you're defending,
you have a number of advantages.

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:20.160
One is that you can have
additional units up at the time

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.530
when the enemy arrives.

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.720
Another is that the
pathing is much easier

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.380
because you don't
have to go anywhere.

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:32.040
You can establish a
better concave in theory

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:36.056
because the enemy might
have to defuse mines.

00:05:36.056 --> 00:05:37.680
It's worth noting
here that, of course,

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.950
you're not guaranteed
this advantage

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:43.170
because the enemy
knows where you are.

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:45.700
You're sort of around
your headquarters.

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.690
I mean, it's generally true that
if you can recognize the enemy

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:50.850
is around his headquarters,
so he's all sort of

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.340
clumped up here.

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.910
Well, it's pretty easy
for you to say, all right,

00:05:54.910 --> 00:06:00.900
I'm going to stay at a
distance r from that enemy,

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.560
and I'm just going to
sort of group up there.

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:08.010
And as soon as everybody is
within a distance r and not

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:11.425
farther than a distance
this other letter,

00:06:11.425 --> 00:06:14.860
then I know that I'm in a good
position to attack all at once.

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:18.650
And so if the enemy's just sort
of hiding there in its hole,

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:22.220
then that's also a vulnerability
as well as an advantage.

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.010
So you could imagine that case.

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:25.540
And you could also
imagine the case

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:29.010
where there's a ton of mines,
and so the minefield is

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:36.460
like this giant, thick
thing, which is filled.

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:40.320
And so you're
defending over here.

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:44.960
And yeah, you're defending here,
and the enemy's coming at you.

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.700
And they kind of
have to go in a line

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:48.540
because it's such
a big mine field,

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:50.010
so you can just
sort surround them.

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:51.926
Yeah, I meant to do that
outlining on purpose.

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:55.660
Oh, my goodness.

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:57.090
Who can use Microsoft Paint?

00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:58.560
I certainly can.

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.220
Let's see here.

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:03.340
So yeah, there's
this concave issue.

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.355
And then there's
another issue that you

00:07:05.355 --> 00:07:07.760
can have the base take hits.

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:10.730
So your base has 500 hit points.

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:13.600
So you can use that
as a sort of buffer

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.870
to try to protect your robot.

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:18.510
It's a very good idea,
but it would spread out

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:19.790
the damage a little bit.

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:21.390
So in the event of
an emergency, it

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:24.800
could be superior to being
farther from your base.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:29.230
Also consider that it's
easier to heal your robots

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:31.927
because you're going to have
this area sort of established.

00:07:31.927 --> 00:07:33.510
You're going to know
where things are.

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:36.035
You're going to have a safe
path to the nearest medbay

00:07:36.035 --> 00:07:36.910
that you might build.

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:40.830
And later on we're going to
look at the effects of building

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:41.992
medbay versus other things.

00:07:41.992 --> 00:07:43.200
It's going to be really good.

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:48.270
So these are just sort of
a first look at things.

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:51.270
There's some other
stuff in here,

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:53.140
like about tactical withdrawal.

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:56.130
When do you realize that
everything's gone to shit,

00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:58.550
and you've got to back out?

00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:03.320
What's the value of preserving
your units versus the penalty

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:04.940
of having them not in combat?

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:07.990
They're in transit
between wherever they are

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:10.250
and the medical bays
that you've built.

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:12.420
Because you could easily
imagine filling the whole

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:15.270
map with medical bays just
to reduce that transit time.

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:19.020
And would that be worth
it compared to just not

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:21.420
having them go to medbay
or only engaging in battles

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:23.200
within a certain
range of the medbay?

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:25.560
So you might actually
be retreating to a range

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:29.280
rather than directly
to the thing itself.

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:31.000
These are things
that you'll probably

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.100
end up thinking about
if you haven't already.

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:37.549
Let's jump straight
into some simulations.

00:08:37.549 --> 00:08:39.720
So what I've done
in this model--

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:43.145
let me zoom in just
a little bit-- is

00:08:43.145 --> 00:08:46.890
I've got a system where
you can build bots.

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:52.360
Bots will die if you have
less than zero resources.

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:54.329
You can build generators,
as you can see here.

00:08:54.329 --> 00:08:56.120
I mean, I'm not expecting
you to read this.

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:58.990
But just showing you the
parts that are in the model

00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:01.779
so that when you look
at the model results,

00:09:01.779 --> 00:09:04.320
you can see for yourself whether
you think they're realistic.

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:05.900
So you can build generators.

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:07.980
And as in the game,
the generators

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:12.140
will provide you an additional
10 resources per turn.

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:15.620
And the cost of
building a generator

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:17.660
is 20 times the
number of encampments

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:18.870
that are currently built.

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:20.600
And here's plus 1 for
the additional one

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:23.060
that you're building.

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:24.870
Same thing applies
for suppliers.

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:27.180
It's got the same build cost.

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:30.610
But instead, it's advantage
is that the spawn time then

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:31.770
becomes this number.

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:34.330
Note that this is different
from what it was in Lecture 1.

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:38.580
In Lecture 1, the spawn
time was 10-- it was this.

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:43.514
It was 10 times 0.95 to the
power of supplier number,

00:09:43.514 --> 00:09:45.930
where supplier number is the
number of suppliers you have.

00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:47.250
That's what it used to be.

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:49.920
But it's been switched
to this number

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:54.000
in order to make it slightly
worse, because it was too good.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.170
This and the other changes have
been updated on the Battlecode

00:09:57.170 --> 00:09:59.097
data sheet that I
made that you might

00:09:59.097 --> 00:10:00.180
remember from the website.

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:02.096
So if you're using that,
make sure that you've

00:10:02.096 --> 00:10:03.070
updated recently.

00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:06.000
And when you download
it, hit F5 or Refresh,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.990
because it has the same
file name as before.

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:09.860
So your computer might
not download it again

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:11.500
unless you specifically
tell it to.

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:13.041
That's just something
to worry about.

00:10:13.041 --> 00:10:15.545
Because it's terrible to be
on a bad version of the specs

00:10:15.545 --> 00:10:16.920
because then you
think I'm wrong,

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:21.970
and that's just very, very
hard to handle for me.

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:23.830
So here's your spawn time here.

00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:25.920
So that's what your
suppliers are doing for you.

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:30.070
And so I've made this model that
tries to build these things,

00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:33.550
tries to build robots, and
it kills the excess ones.

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:37.050
So we're trying to reach
a large number of robots.

00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:39.830
to Zoom out just
a little bit here.

00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:44.070
So you can see here that
we've got power over time,

00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:45.464
and this is for 500 rounds.

00:10:45.464 --> 00:10:46.880
I've got it so
that you can change

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:48.130
the length of the simulation.

00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:50.340
And we're going to see quite
a number of simulations

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:51.840
here today.

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:54.250
So you could see here
that, at first, you

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:55.290
start out with no power.

00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:57.760
I don't know if this is 100%
realistic because I think

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:00.660
in the game you might actually
start out with full power

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:01.950
to begin with.

00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:03.575
But that's a transient effect.

00:11:03.575 --> 00:11:04.950
I wouldn't really
worry about it.

00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:06.300
We're physicists here.

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:08.750
We talk about
orders of magnitude.

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:10.290
Yes.

00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:13.080
So you could see here that
initially your power decays

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:15.770
upward to some
relatively stable value.

00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:18.210
But it begins to decrease
as you build robots,

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:21.760
because as the number of
robots increases over time,

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:23.340
the upkeep is increasing.

00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:26.800
And so you're decaying downward
to stable values as you go.

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:29.580
And then it becomes a
stable number of robots

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:33.590
as they are produced, and then
they also run out of energy.

00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:36.130
So I've also plotted down
here the maximum number

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:38.840
of robots that are achieved
within a simulation.

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:43.050
So this shows that you hit
40 robots at round 391.

00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:45.000
We're going to end up
looking at this quantity

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.170
and trying to see how
we can make the most

00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:49.780
robots at the
shortest round number.

00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:52.850
Or how we can have a trade-off
between maybe getting

00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:55.350
the most robots
at an early number

00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:57.670
or getting more robots
at a later number, which

00:11:57.670 --> 00:11:59.920
would embody the
difference between a rush

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:03.020
strategy and an econ strategy.

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:04.820
I've also plotted
the spawn time so

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:07.030
that you can see how
the effect of suppliers

00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:10.180
is changing how long it
takes for robots to spawn.

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:12.700
In this example, there
aren't any suppliers,

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:14.730
so the spawn time is flat.

00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:16.439
So let's change the
example a little bit.

00:12:16.439 --> 00:12:18.021
I'm going to zoom
out just a tiny bit,

00:12:18.021 --> 00:12:20.290
making everything illegible,
so that you can see also

00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:23.140
the inputs to this
function that I've made.

00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:27.550
And so I'm going to make it
so that the bytecode usage is

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:28.470
5,000.

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:30.610
And what effect
should that have?

00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:33.600
It should decrease the number
of robots that we can sustain.

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.720
And sure enough, we see
that when we run it,

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:40.120
the maximum number we hit is
now 27 robots at round 261.

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:42.776
So we've hit there sooner,
but it's a smaller number.

00:12:42.776 --> 00:12:45.110
It's just worse in every way.

00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:46.650
You want to save bytecodes.

00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:48.530
So let's go back
to that example.

00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:50.560
Now, generator built
rounds and supplier

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:53.520
built rounds is the number of
rounds between every time it

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:56.610
will attempt to build a
generator or a supplier.

00:12:56.610 --> 00:12:58.660
This is the basic version
that I started with.

00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:01.127
So let's start by building
generators every 10 rounds.

00:13:01.127 --> 00:13:03.460
This is assuming that there
are enough generators around

00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:04.740
for us to build on.

00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:07.320
So you can see here that the
first generator is built around

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:07.850
here.

00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:11.184
There's a tiny dip, and
here's another and another.

00:13:11.184 --> 00:13:12.600
But the generator
doesn't actually

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:15.790
kick in and start to take
effect until 50 turns later

00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:18.360
because there's a capture delay,
and it doesn't do anything

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:20.010
while it's being captured.

00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:23.390
Then once these are
captured, the amount of power

00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:24.890
you have skyrockets.

00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:27.240
So this was the
previous maximum of 200.

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:30.450
And now we're up to 2,000
power in just 500 rounds.

00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:35.520
This shows that you can really
amplify your economy rapidly.

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:39.210
You'll notice here that
the sawtooth behavior

00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:41.380
is becoming increasingly severe.

00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:44.070
This is because each
one of these motions

00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:47.690
downward indicates the purchase
of yet another generator, which

00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:49.160
costs more than the last.

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:51.280
Because as I mentioned
before, the cost

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:54.052
of capturing an encampment is 20
times the number of encampments

00:13:54.052 --> 00:13:54.760
you have already.

00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:57.080
So that's going to
linearly increase.

00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:59.350
You could see that it's
recovering faster and faster

00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:02.530
though because, as
has been mentioned,

00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:06.300
the generators do produce
10 energy per turn.

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:08.830
So here we can see that
it's not hitting any limit

00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:10.580
to the number of robots
that can be built.

00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:13.660
And if we extend the
simulation out to 2,000 rounds,

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:16.690
we can see that it just
continues on as it was before,

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:18.780
and the number of
robots is unlimited.

00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:23.370
So if you do find a map that
has a whole lot of encampments

00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:25.360
to capture-- and we
haven't specified

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:27.330
that there's a maximum
number of encampments

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:29.610
as far as I know--
then you could end up

00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:31.270
just continuing to
build these things.

00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:33.800
And then it doesn't matter
how terrible your micro is

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:38.180
or how terrible your tech
is because you'll just

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:39.020
overwhelm the enemy.

00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:42.880
Hey, look, at round
1991, what a good year.

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:45.080
That's pretty special.

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:46.780
So let's go back
down to 500 where

00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:49.360
we can see what's going on,
and let's change generator

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:50.510
built rounds to 1.

00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:53.290
So now we're going to try to
build a generator every round.

00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:54.340
But look at here.

00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:57.010
These red dots indicating
the completion of generators

00:14:57.010 --> 00:14:58.970
are non-uniformly spaced.

00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:00.590
That seems to
indicate that it's not

00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:02.950
able to build
generators every turn.

00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:04.750
That's because there's
not enough power.

00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:07.270
You can see here that the
power is as close to 0

00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:10.560
as it possibly can
without destroying robots

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:12.930
from bringing it down
to negative values.

00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:15.360
So you can see here
that you can now

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:18.480
get to have more robots than
you otherwise would have.

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:19.447
No, that's not true.

00:15:19.447 --> 00:15:21.530
You can't have any more
robots because we're still

00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:23.820
limited by the rate at which
they're being produced.

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:25.850
They're only being produced
one every 10 rounds,

00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:28.970
and that's really cramping
our style, as it were.

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:31.790
So let's increase this
back up to a million

00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:34.260
so that it's not building
any more generators.

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:36.290
Let's try building
just suppliers.

00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:38.990
So let's build a
supplier every 10 rounds.

00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:40.800
As you can see here,
here's the money

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:42.650
being expended on suppliers.

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:45.840
And pretty soon, even
before round 100,

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:48.640
we start hitting a point where
the number of robots we have,

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:51.500
which is accelerating over
time as the spawn time

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:54.100
is decreasing, the
number of robots going up

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:56.360
is preventing us from
getting enough power

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:58.100
to continue building suppliers.

00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:00.500
So we're actually capped.

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:04.030
This behavior, where the
power goes down and crashes,

00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:08.440
is going to really hurt our
ability to play the game.

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:12.630
It becomes exacerbated the
faster you build suppliers.

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:15.850
Because you see here, I built
these suppliers, and then,

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:16.570
bingo.

00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:19.040
I've only built a total
of-- let's see here,

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:24.700
supplier number, I've built
a total of eight suppliers

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:29.050
within the first, I don't
know, this looks like 40 turns.

00:16:29.050 --> 00:16:30.830
And now I'm not going
to be able to build

00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:32.680
anything else for
the whole game,

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:36.760
because the next encampment
that I buy would cost 8 times 20

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:41.590
is 160, plus 20 for the next
one, is going to be 180.

00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:43.740
I simply can't afford
that if my power is never

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:45.770
exceeding 170 over here.

00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:48.460
So that's pretty much going
to be a crippling blow.

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:51.880
So maybe, as my player, I
need to do one of two things.

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:54.780
One, maybe I should build
suppliers and generators.

00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:57.610
Two, I could notice that
maybe the enemy has killed

00:16:57.610 --> 00:17:00.430
a bunch of my generators, but I
still have suppliers left over.

00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:01.626
Have you thought about that?

00:17:01.626 --> 00:17:03.000
Maybe some of your
suppliers will

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.540
have to destroy
themselves to make room

00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:07.250
for more power generation.

00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:10.790
It could be something that
happens to you less than not

00:17:10.790 --> 00:17:15.200
ever, or which is to say
more often than not ever.

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:17.460
So let's make it 10 and 10.

00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:18.919
So we're trying to
do some of each.

00:17:18.919 --> 00:17:20.168
Well, it's not really working.

00:17:20.168 --> 00:17:22.130
It's like building some,
and then the others

00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:24.970
because one of them is taking
precedence over the first.

00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:28.329
Maybe we'll try building these
every 20 and these every 10.

00:17:28.329 --> 00:17:29.870
Well, now it's
building some of each.

00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:31.280
This is not so bad.

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:33.880
So now we're getting
to 76 robots at 496.

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:35.850
Our power is going up,
but we're not so much

00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:37.620
wasting it as we were before.

00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:40.120
And we can see that the spawn
time has gone all the way down

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:41.110
to half.

00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:43.640
Now, this does assume
that none of your robots

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:44.860
are being destroyed.

00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:46.880
If you're actively
losing robots,

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:49.370
it makes perfect sense
to build only suppliers

00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:51.660
because, at that point,
you can clump up your units

00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:53.900
and lose them, which
will give you the money

00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:55.260
to continue building units.

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:59.450
It's only when you've favored
suppliers and then not attacked

00:17:59.450 --> 00:18:02.020
that you're wasting
your effort and time.

00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:04.560
So this is something that I
saw in some of the scrimmage

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:06.020
matches that I've
been looking at,

00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:08.840
because we devs have access to
all kinds of secret information

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:12.189
about you, including
the performance

00:18:12.189 --> 00:18:13.730
of your players in
scrimmage matches.

00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:16.040
And so I've been downloading
these maps and looking at them.

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:17.430
And in these
matches, I've tended

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:19.580
to see that, a lot
of times, we're

00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:21.957
favoring suppliers
but not attacking.

00:18:21.957 --> 00:18:23.540
Other times, we're
favoring suppliers,

00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:25.990
and we're just sending
our units one by one

00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:27.820
to be killed by the enemy blob.

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:30.470
I think that's also sub-optimal.

00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:32.680
But at the same
time, we have seen

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:34.300
quite a few good strategies.

00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:36.470
I've seen some great
pathing, and I've

00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:38.660
seen some great
solving for the map.

00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:40.494
I think that there's a
lot to be done there.

00:18:40.494 --> 00:18:42.076
And I have confidence
that we're going

00:18:42.076 --> 00:18:44.440
to see a lot of great matches
in the sprint tournament.

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:47.540
So let's go back to the
model here and look again

00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:49.490
at maybe getting a build order.

00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:52.020
So here, the build
order I'm defining as,

00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:54.580
what order do you get
suppliers and generators?

00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:57.840
This way of doing it, as you
see I've implemented it here,

00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:00.200
is kind of inefficient,
because whichever

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:02.810
one goes first is
just whichever one

00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:04.720
hit the round
counter or something.

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:07.970
So here I re-implement the
whole system with an explicit

00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:09.150
build order.

00:19:09.150 --> 00:19:13.560
So I can say, all right,
please give me a bunch of 2,

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:18.050
and then give me 2 and then
1 in alternating turns.

00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:20.740
So you can see here-- it's
not working very well--

00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:25.100
2 is my number for
the supplier, and 1

00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:27.240
is my indicator
for the generator.

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:31.830
So here we do five 2's, and then
we alternate 2 and 1 forever.

00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:35.665
So there are the five 2's, and
then we've got a 2, 1, and a 2,

00:19:35.665 --> 00:19:36.690
and a 1.

00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:39.010
Well, that's not very good
because we still crash,

00:19:39.010 --> 00:19:41.490
and we only hit a
maximum of 57 robots.

00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:44.570
So let's consider reducing
this number of 2's.

00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:46.010
Well, that's much better.

00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:50.035
So now we've gotten up
to 87 robots around 495.

00:19:50.035 --> 00:19:51.410
Now, if you've
been keeping track

00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:53.060
in your mind of which
number of robots

00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:54.990
we've hit at which
round, congratulations.

00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:56.606
You're much better
at that than me.

00:19:56.606 --> 00:19:58.230
Later on, I'm going
to be showing plots

00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:00.690
so that we don't have to
memorize how many robots we

00:20:00.690 --> 00:20:01.940
have at what round.

00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:03.600
But for the sake
of illustration,

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:06.150
it's pretty useful to be
able to say, all right, if I

00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:09.740
add one more supplier here,
how does that help me?

00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:11.570
Well, if you look
very carefully,

00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:14.232
it's going to shift your
early number of robots up,

00:20:14.232 --> 00:20:16.690
and it's probably going to
shift your late number of robots

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:17.189
down.

00:20:17.189 --> 00:20:18.900
That's the way it's
changing the shape.

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:22.490
So you can see here that
that's a very subtle change.

00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:24.910
Let's change it so that we're
only building suppliers,

00:20:24.910 --> 00:20:27.020
and then we're only
building generators.

00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:29.000
So there we've built a
few suppliers, and then

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.280
a lot of generators.

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:31.770
That's 62 robots.

00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:33.480
We can keep changing it and try.

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:34.700
Here's a few more suppliers.

00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:35.491
Well, look at that.

00:20:35.491 --> 00:20:38.210
We never got the chance to
build any generators because we

00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:40.340
ran out of energy when we
were building suppliers.

00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:43.790
This is the same issue
that we were seeing before.

00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:45.730
So let's explore the
space automatically.

00:20:45.730 --> 00:20:47.350
This is kind of weird.

00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:49.130
What I'm going to
show you is a plot

00:20:49.130 --> 00:20:50.960
of the peak number
of robots that you've

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:54.799
gotten during the simulation
versus the number of rounds.

00:20:54.799 --> 00:20:56.340
And what I'm going
to do is I'm going

00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:59.140
to sort of move along the
space in some line, which

00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:02.340
is going to be an automatic
search for these various things

00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:03.950
that we're looking for.

00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:07.220
So yeah, so where do you
want to be on this graph?

00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:09.270
You want to be up
here at the upper left

00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:11.670
because that means that
you're getting a lot of robots

00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:13.920
at a small number of rounds.

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:16.240
This is the phenomenon
that we were seeing before,

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:20.344
where going from
1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8--

00:21:20.344 --> 00:21:23.010
you could see that it's skipping
some numbers because they would

00:21:23.010 --> 00:21:25.720
have written over one another.

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:27.950
Yeah, I'll show it
with all the numbers.

00:21:31.122 --> 00:21:31.830
Well, that's odd.

00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:34.450
It changed shape.

00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:38.300
Ba, ba da, ba, ba,
ba, ba, ba, ba.

00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:39.680
Well, let's go with it.

00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:44.690
So this example is-- did I
define the explicit system?

00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:46.720
This is the explicit
system here.

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:48.160
Did I set that?

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:49.250
And then did I define it?

00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:51.810
Well, all right,
that's how it is.

00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:57.610
So this system is showing
you from 0 up to 15

00:21:57.610 --> 00:21:59.630
for every time it's
trying a longer

00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:03.160
or a shorter system of
building the suppliers.

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:05.120
So if it says 0,
it means it just

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:06.650
goes straight into generators.

00:22:06.650 --> 00:22:08.540
And if it says a
higher number, then it

00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:12.450
has built that many suppliers
before it goes into generators.

00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:15.020
So you could see,
yeah, so that's there.

00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:17.322
And the numbers sort of
start to overlap one another,

00:22:17.322 --> 00:22:19.780
so I made this little function
that gets rid of the numbers

00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:21.600
if they're too close
to another number.

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:24.211
And that changed the way
it looked quite a bit.

00:22:24.211 --> 00:22:27.925
[INAUDIBLE] 2,000 at the bottom
if you take that [INAUDIBLE]?

00:22:27.925 --> 00:22:29.440
I see, I see.

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:30.660
It was going out to 2,000.

00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:32.050
Thank you, thank you.

00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:35.240
So let's make this, yeah,
let's make this just to 1,000.

00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:37.250
Strategy exploration is there.

00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:39.820
Simplified exploration is here.

00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:40.760
Yeah.

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:42.240
So there are the numbers.

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:45.470
And this phenomenon is the thing
that we've been seeing before,

00:22:45.470 --> 00:22:49.840
that as you have more and
more suppliers to begin with,

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:52.530
it's OK up to a
point, at which you

00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:54.230
can't build any more robots.

00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:56.480
And you hit a limit because
you've run out of power.

00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:56.980
OK.

00:22:56.980 --> 00:22:58.900
That's what we've
seen, seen it 100 ways.

00:22:58.900 --> 00:22:59.720
That's good.

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:01.450
Let's switch to a mix of things.

00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:04.370
So instead of doing
all one, we do a mix

00:23:04.370 --> 00:23:06.540
so that we're alternating
one and the other.

00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:09.640
So in this example,
we're starting

00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:13.490
with i numbers of
suppliers, and then we're

00:23:13.490 --> 00:23:15.840
going to follow it
up with alternating

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:17.540
generators and suppliers.

00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:19.290
And you can see
here that the best

00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:21.680
result seems to be something.

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:23.180
I mean, you really
can't decide just

00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:26.340
based on this graph because
these are maximum points.

00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:29.400
And if this is 8,
is that a better way

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:31.690
to operate for a rush strategy?

00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:33.700
Well, here's a way of
addressing that question.

00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:36.130
Here I've plotted
the number of robots

00:23:36.130 --> 00:23:38.479
versus the round for this 0.

00:23:38.479 --> 00:23:40.020
And you can see here
that it's always

00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:42.060
above the other
peak robot counts.

00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:45.040
So that indicates that
it's definitively better

00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:47.980
to start building generators
before you start building

00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:51.070
suppliers, at least if you're
aiming for the peak robot

00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:51.570
condition.

00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:55.020
You're trying to get the
greatest number of robots.

00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:56.130
So there you go.

00:23:56.130 --> 00:23:57.440
It's better always to use zero.

00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:01.480
And here if we compare
different strategies,

00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:03.040
we can see them
on the same space.

00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:04.620
And one is obviously better.

00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:07.750
This one above here that's new
is much better than the one

00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:08.350
we had before.

00:24:08.350 --> 00:24:10.750
It gets us more robots
at the same round number.

00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:12.750
And again, we're trying
to get to the upper left

00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:13.860
of this graph.

00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:17.460
This strategy consists
of building a generator,

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:23.300
and then building
a supplier i times.

00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:25.450
So we'll do that set i
times, and then we'll

00:24:25.450 --> 00:24:27.795
go into building 1, 2, 2.

00:24:27.795 --> 00:24:29.920
So then we'll be building
a generator for every two

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:31.210
suppliers.

00:24:31.210 --> 00:24:35.570
And we could see that this
is much better at any point.

00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:38.755
So that's pretty interesting.

00:24:38.755 --> 00:24:39.880
That is pretty interesting.

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:41.620
Because then we
can say, all right,

00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:43.430
I've played around with this.

00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:44.960
Maybe it's better to have three.

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:45.870
Is that even better?

00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:47.730
We'll see, we'll see.

00:24:47.730 --> 00:24:49.450
That changes the
shape a little bit.

00:24:49.450 --> 00:24:51.830
So that gives me a bit of an
improvement in this region.

00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:55.270
So if we really want to have
the most robots at this round,

00:24:55.270 --> 00:24:57.865
possibly the best way to
do it is to start here.

00:24:57.865 --> 00:25:00.320
And I know that these are
all pretty obscure-looking,

00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:04.610
so I'm going to just skip
straight on down to over here,

00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:06.930
where we can look at
the effect of a rush.

00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:08.960
And we can see it
very concretely

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:16.050
that, in this example, we've
got the first guy in blue.

00:25:16.050 --> 00:25:20.330
He's building only
generators for 40 rounds,

00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:22.790
and then he's going to
start building suppliers.

00:25:22.790 --> 00:25:25.160
So there you can see blue
is building only generators,

00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:26.743
and then he starts
building suppliers.

00:25:26.743 --> 00:25:29.970
And his robot production
rate increases.

00:25:29.970 --> 00:25:33.510
Here in red, the red guy is
starting by building suppliers.

00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:38.870
And so you can see he caps out
at 41 suppliers, or 41 robots

00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:41.490
for a moment, and then
he's back to oscillating.

00:25:41.490 --> 00:25:45.990
So he's got a military advantage
in this window starting

00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:49.500
from round 100 going up to
round 300, where, for a time,

00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:51.650
he's going to
outnumber the enemy.

00:25:51.650 --> 00:25:54.500
And his goal is to
win during this time.

00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:58.120
So if you outnumber the
enemy starting at round 100

00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:01.140
and going to 300, here's
what you have to do.

00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:03.960
You have to get to the enemy
and start shooting at him.

00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:07.670
So if the map is
really, really big,

00:26:07.670 --> 00:26:10.009
like if the map
is 100, size 100,

00:26:10.009 --> 00:26:11.425
you don't have the
pickax upgrade.

00:26:11.425 --> 00:26:17.470
So you're going to be defusing
mines at 12 rounds per mine.

00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:20.694
If you've got 50 mines
in the way and 12 each,

00:26:20.694 --> 00:26:22.610
there's no way that
you're going to get there.

00:26:22.610 --> 00:26:24.550
Because it's going to
take you 500 rounds just

00:26:24.550 --> 00:26:26.091
to get to the enemy,
and you'll never

00:26:26.091 --> 00:26:27.970
actually get to start shooting.

00:26:27.970 --> 00:26:30.320
But if you can find a
straight path to your enemy,

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:32.570
even if the map
is 50 units long,

00:26:32.570 --> 00:26:34.950
you can get there and start
capitalizing on your unit

00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:37.560
advantage before his
econ play kicks in.

00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:40.392
So there you go, a
very concrete example

00:26:40.392 --> 00:26:43.177
of the effects of rushing
or playing an econ.

00:26:43.177 --> 00:26:44.760
At the same time,
you could definitely

00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:46.499
imagine intermediate strategies.

00:26:46.499 --> 00:26:48.290
So here I'm just going
to go ahead and plot

00:26:48.290 --> 00:26:52.670
a third strategy, which
maybe I'll make in green.

00:26:52.670 --> 00:26:54.600
And maybe this strategy
is a mix of the two.

00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:59.380
So instead of starting with just
generators or just suppliers,

00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:02.470
we'll do a combination of
generators and suppliers.

00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:03.180
Now look at that.

00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:04.550
That's pretty interesting.

00:27:04.550 --> 00:27:09.030
Let's extend the simulation
length to 800 rounds,

00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:11.470
and we'll be able
to see the effects.

00:27:11.470 --> 00:27:14.600
So now we see that the green
player does almost as well

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:15.510
as the red player.

00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:17.850
It's almost indistinguishable
at this distance.

00:27:17.850 --> 00:27:19.410
And given the
defensive advantage

00:27:19.410 --> 00:27:22.040
we talked about earlier, it may
be enough for the green player

00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:23.060
to hold off.

00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:25.400
He'll still be able to
smash the red player.

00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:27.950
And he's still got an
advantage over the blue player

00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:30.340
without being that
much at a disadvantage.

00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:32.570
That is to say that the
green advantage lasts

00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:34.330
until about round 600.

00:27:34.330 --> 00:27:37.270
Let's zoom in a little bit
so that we can see round 600

00:27:37.270 --> 00:27:40.320
and try to assess how much
better the green player is

00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:41.385
than the blue player.

00:27:41.385 --> 00:27:43.680
So here, once again,
green is building

00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:47.230
alternating generators
and suppliers.

00:27:47.230 --> 00:27:49.240
And he has an
advantage over blue

00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:54.540
starting at about round 100
and going to about round 450.

00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:56.040
That's a pretty big
round and that's

00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:58.360
a pretty big advantage
for a pretty long time.

00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:01.400
It's only at that time that
blue begins to take off

00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:03.490
and gets a serious advantage.

00:28:03.490 --> 00:28:07.150
So you can see here that there's
a pretty significant difference

00:28:07.150 --> 00:28:09.510
between different
strategies and that you

00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:11.900
can achieve a significant
difference of units.

00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:14.080
But how many different
differences of units

00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:16.920
are important to start
really making a difference?

00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:19.650
I mean, if you have 10
units versus their 11,

00:28:19.650 --> 00:28:21.040
how good is that?

00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:22.130
Is that a lot?

00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:22.755
Is it a little?

00:28:22.755 --> 00:28:24.512
It doesn't seem like very much.

00:28:24.512 --> 00:28:25.970
Well, to answer
that question, I've

00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:27.550
made yet another simulation.

00:28:27.550 --> 00:28:29.920
Because why not do a simulation?

00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:31.750
Simulations are fun.

00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:33.910
So here's a look at it.

00:28:33.910 --> 00:28:37.377
And what I've made here is
sort of a very basic simulator

00:28:37.377 --> 00:28:38.710
that works in the following way.

00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:40.920
I'm going to zoom
in a little bit.

00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:42.536
So this is some
combat, and I'm going

00:28:42.536 --> 00:28:45.139
to simulate the combat
between 10 and 11 units.

00:28:45.139 --> 00:28:46.680
I'm going to do it
a couple of times.

00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:49.525
I'll start out doing
it slowly, so I'm

00:28:49.525 --> 00:28:50.900
decreasing the
compute time here.

00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:53.005
So there's 11 units
on the bottom,

00:28:53.005 --> 00:28:54.490
and these are their hit points.

00:28:54.490 --> 00:28:57.100
And there are 10
units on the top.

00:28:57.100 --> 00:28:58.350
I'm going to do it once again.

00:28:58.350 --> 00:28:59.766
I'm going to start
with 10 and 10.

00:28:59.766 --> 00:29:02.360
This is team A on top
and team B on bottom.

00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:03.950
As you can see here,
that when there

00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:05.480
are the same number of
units, they all lose

00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:07.190
hit points at the same
rate, and they all

00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:10.080
die at the same time, at
least in my simulation.

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:13.130
When there's an advantage,
that extra robot that you have

00:29:13.130 --> 00:29:15.910
can start dealing additional
damage to his robots.

00:29:15.910 --> 00:29:19.500
And so that advantage becomes
more significant over time.

00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:23.840
So if we have 100
units versus 101 units,

00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:25.390
then we'll be here all day.

00:29:25.390 --> 00:29:27.040
But the point is
that you'll end up

00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:28.840
seeing a more and
more significant

00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:30.880
difference between the two.

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:33.860
That didn't seem to work
quite right, did it?

00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:35.290
But perhaps it did.

00:29:35.290 --> 00:29:37.160
It may just have the
exact same result.

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:38.036
I'd be quite curious.

00:29:38.036 --> 00:29:39.743
Well, in any case,
we're going to go back

00:29:39.743 --> 00:29:41.370
to the example we
were showing before.

00:29:41.370 --> 00:29:44.050
What I'm going to do is I'm
going to say, OK, when you have

00:29:44.050 --> 00:29:48.920
10 versus 11, the 11 team
ends up with four units left.

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:52.000
And two of them are very low
hit points, but two of them

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.730
have a lot of the
points remaining.

00:29:53.730 --> 00:29:56.880
So we can start to define two
quantities, the robot kill

00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:59.890
ratio and the HP kill ratio.

00:29:59.890 --> 00:30:04.760
So the robot kill ratio is
to say I put in 11 units,

00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:07.760
and I got out four
of mine remaining.

00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:09.890
So 11 is the bottom.

00:30:09.890 --> 00:30:12.620
I got four remaining,
so that cost me seven.

00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:14.680
But in the process
of costing me seven,

00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:17.200
I was able to take
out 10 enemy units.

00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:19.536
So that's 10 divided
by 7, and if we

00:30:19.536 --> 00:30:21.410
make it numerical with
a decimal point there,

00:30:21.410 --> 00:30:22.201
we see that number.

00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:25.420
Question.

00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:28.270
Yeah, how [INAUDIBLE]?

00:30:28.270 --> 00:30:30.220
So I'm actually
modeling the combat

00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:32.720
by distributing
the attack evenly

00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:34.030
from one side and the other.

00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:36.730
And then any remaining units
will have the opportunity

00:30:36.730 --> 00:30:39.950
to deal more damage
to the enemy team.

00:30:39.950 --> 00:30:42.390
So I don't know exactly
how accurate it is.

00:30:42.390 --> 00:30:45.070
And if you can manage to
maintain a tight choke point,

00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:47.130
then you can trade
evenly with your enemy.

00:30:47.130 --> 00:30:50.470
But that's the best you can
do if you're outnumbered.

00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:52.824
If you have the advantage
and you surround the enemy,

00:30:52.824 --> 00:30:54.490
then you could do
even better than this.

00:30:54.490 --> 00:30:58.280
This is something like a middle
ground between those two cases.

00:30:58.280 --> 00:30:59.610
Good question.

00:30:59.610 --> 00:31:01.840
If you want to see the
actual way that it works,

00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:05.210
learn Mathematica and read
the code that's right here.

00:31:05.210 --> 00:31:07.950
So we see here that there's
the robot kill ratio.

00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:09.520
That's pretty good.

00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:12.300
We came to the fight with
10% additional units,

00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:16.730
and we end up getting 40%
more value out of our units

00:31:16.730 --> 00:31:18.825
that we lost.

00:31:18.825 --> 00:31:22.830
On a hit point basis, we didn't
get that much of an advantage.

00:31:22.830 --> 00:31:27.630
Bringing a 10% advantage got
us 6% hit point advantage

00:31:27.630 --> 00:31:30.840
on how many hit points we were
able to lose versus the enemy.

00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:32.750
So let's look at
a lot of results.

00:31:32.750 --> 00:31:34.440
So here on the left,
I made a table.

00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:38.650
So I've just done the simulation
for 20 units versus i units,

00:31:38.650 --> 00:31:40.960
where i goes from 21 to 30.

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:44.510
So you can see the force ratio
that I'm bringing to the table.

00:31:44.510 --> 00:31:47.140
Here I'm imagining that I
have more than the enemy.

00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:49.140
But of course, you can
just invert these numbers

00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:50.810
and get the reverse case.

00:31:50.810 --> 00:31:55.080
The force ratio I'm bringing is
5% extra, 10% extra, and so on,

00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:57.630
and that achieves
these unit kill ratios.

00:31:57.630 --> 00:31:59.750
You can see here I've
capped it out at 20,000

00:31:59.750 --> 00:32:01.870
so that it doesn't
display the infinity sign.

00:32:01.870 --> 00:32:06.970
Because here, once you have more
than 1/3 more than the enemy,

00:32:06.970 --> 00:32:09.790
you don't lose any units
at all during combat.

00:32:09.790 --> 00:32:12.100
That's according to the
simulation that I've set up.

00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:14.720
A pretty amazing
result if you ask me.

00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:17.500
So you can see here that the
unit kill ratio magnifies quite

00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:18.530
intensely.

00:32:18.530 --> 00:32:21.470
The hit point kill ratio
doesn't magnify that intensely.

00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:26.670
So here, 5% force ratio gets
you about 20% unit kill.

00:32:26.670 --> 00:32:28.670
10% gets you 40%.

00:32:28.670 --> 00:32:31.450
15% gets you 80% extra.

00:32:31.450 --> 00:32:33.620
And then once you get
up higher, it just

00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:35.150
ramps up more from there.

00:32:35.150 --> 00:32:40.700
So it shows that even it's
a fight of five versus four,

00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:43.690
it's probably a very bad
idea to engage the enemy.

00:32:43.690 --> 00:32:46.860
Because you're not going to be
able to kill any of their units

00:32:46.860 --> 00:32:49.460
before they kill all of yours,
which means that all of theirs

00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:51.310
can sort of head
back to a medbay,

00:32:51.310 --> 00:32:54.510
get healed up, and then
be back to the fight.

00:32:54.510 --> 00:32:58.480
It's worth mentioning here
that the medbay can end up

00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:00.630
being as productive
as your headquarters.

00:33:00.630 --> 00:33:06.260
So let's go back up to where
I've talked about the medbay.

00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:07.480
Let's talk about it here.

00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:09.690
So let's talk about the
production abilities

00:33:09.690 --> 00:33:11.380
of your various capabilities.

00:33:11.380 --> 00:33:13.610
You've got your
headquarters, which

00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:17.240
is making units at
40 hit points each.

00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:20.430
And let's say that it produces
them every 10 rounds, or maybe

00:33:20.430 --> 00:33:23.380
every 5 rounds at best if
you've got a lot of suppliers.

00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:25.400
So this is your
headquarters building units.

00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:28.410
So it's building hit
points every turn.

00:33:28.410 --> 00:33:31.240
So it's building from four
to eight hit points per turn.

00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:32.630
Well, that's not too bad.

00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:34.980
That's building four to
eight hit points per turn.

00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:36.860
But what about everything else?

00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:40.350
A medbay can heal two
hit points for every

00:33:40.350 --> 00:33:41.750
of the adjacent units.

00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:44.660
So that there, right there--
if you can multiply correctly--

00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:46.610
it's 16 hit points per turn.

00:33:46.610 --> 00:33:48.180
That's so many.

00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:51.470
That's the value of two
headquarters right there,

00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:54.640
even considering headquarters
at full supplier capacity.

00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:56.810
That just shows that even
if you're using medbays

00:33:56.810 --> 00:34:00.850
incorrectly or doing it wrong in
the various ways that you can,

00:34:00.850 --> 00:34:03.580
you'll still be doing a much
better job than a headquarters

00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:04.279
alone.

00:34:04.279 --> 00:34:06.070
I mean, that's ignoring
the fact that there

00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:08.239
are other things at play here.

00:34:08.239 --> 00:34:09.830
Like you have to
have injured units

00:34:09.830 --> 00:34:12.230
in order to produce
hit points in a medbay.

00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:13.900
But it's certainly
worth mentioning

00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:17.179
that even this basic
analysis shows what it is.

00:34:17.179 --> 00:34:18.696
Very clear.

00:34:18.696 --> 00:34:20.570
Now, what's the killing
ability of artillery?

00:34:20.570 --> 00:34:22.236
It's been said that
they're overpowered.

00:34:22.236 --> 00:34:24.560
Or that they're quite strong,
and they're definitely

00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:25.460
worth using.

00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:28.320
But is the killing power
of an artillery worth

00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:30.810
it compared to the
healing power of a medbay?

00:34:30.810 --> 00:34:32.520
Purely from a
numerical standpoint,

00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:35.500
you can see here that the
best the artillery can do

00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:38.420
is to deal 40 damage to
its target and 20 damage

00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:41.980
to each of eight targets
adjacent for a total of 200,

00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:43.520
if I did that math correctly.

00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:47.040
And it does that every 20 turns,
which is its attack delay.

00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:49.948
So that gives us 10
hit points per turn.

00:34:49.948 --> 00:34:50.489
Look at that.

00:34:50.489 --> 00:34:52.929
Oftentimes, 10 less than 16.

00:34:52.929 --> 00:34:53.947
True.

00:34:53.947 --> 00:34:55.280
It's even going to tell me that.

00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:56.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:56.870 --> 00:34:58.990
Well, what a big surprise.

00:34:58.990 --> 00:35:02.850
So you can make the
decision for yourself.

00:35:02.850 --> 00:35:04.900
And of course, each
one has its own uses,

00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:07.340
because the artillery
is not always

00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:08.980
going to be able to
deal 10 hit points.

00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:11.090
Medbay's not always going
to be able to heal units.

00:35:11.090 --> 00:35:12.756
Maybe it's too far
from the headquarters

00:35:12.756 --> 00:35:14.300
to be a real defensive asset.

00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:14.846
Maybe not.

00:35:14.846 --> 00:35:16.720
There are a lot of
considerations to include.

00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:18.340
But doing a
calculation like this

00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:21.380
can certainly help you out
in making your decisions.

00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:23.140
For example, I mean,
I think it's worth

00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:24.590
doing the following check.

00:35:24.590 --> 00:35:27.360
Check if there's an
encampment near your base.

00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:30.000
If there is, go ahead
and make it a medbay.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:31.434
If it's not that
near, maybe it's

00:35:31.434 --> 00:35:32.600
better to make it artillery.

00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:35.120
Like if it's adjacent, you
probably want a medbay.

00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:36.610
But if it's not
close, the medbay

00:35:36.610 --> 00:35:38.090
becomes less and less valuable.

00:35:38.090 --> 00:35:40.120
Whereas if it's in
still artillery range,

00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:41.679
maybe it's still worth having.

00:35:41.679 --> 00:35:44.220
It's the kind of question-- this
is the kind of trade-off you

00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:46.178
could make, and you could
just hard-code it in.

00:35:46.178 --> 00:35:48.700
If it's more than a
distance 16, distance

00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:50.510
squared 16, then go
ahead, do it this way.

00:35:50.510 --> 00:35:52.180
Otherwise, do it that way.

00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:54.450
Very simple way of
addressing the problem.

00:35:54.450 --> 00:35:56.810
So let's go back down
and let's talk more

00:35:56.810 --> 00:35:59.230
about encounters of units.

00:35:59.230 --> 00:36:04.030
So let's continue with this
unit kill ratio results table.

00:36:04.030 --> 00:36:05.235
So we're here.

00:36:05.235 --> 00:36:07.360
And you know, it's kind of
hard to look at numbers.

00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:08.980
Oftentimes when people
have a lot of numbers,

00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:10.670
especially in a
table, they plot it.

00:36:10.670 --> 00:36:11.670
So here I've got a plot.

00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:13.540
Doesn't mean that much.

00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:16.280
Let's do a list plot
so we've got points.

00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:20.160
And so we're asking the
question-- here is the input.

00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:20.910
Is that the input?

00:36:20.910 --> 00:36:23.870
No, the input, it
goes up to 1.3.

00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:25.400
Yeah, the input is here.

00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:30.960
So this is having 5% advantage,
10% advantage, and so on.

00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:33.700
And the question is,
how many hit points

00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:34.630
is that worth for you?

00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:36.650
What hit point advantage
does that get you?

00:36:36.650 --> 00:36:41.090
And so we could do a best
fit for these results.

00:36:41.090 --> 00:36:43.890
So in Mathematica that would
look like-- find a fit.

00:36:43.890 --> 00:36:45.936
You put the data in.

00:36:45.936 --> 00:36:48.870
You put the
expression ax plus b,

00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:50.590
where a and b are
the parameters,

00:36:50.590 --> 00:36:52.830
and x is the
variable in question.

00:36:52.830 --> 00:36:54.940
And this is your fit
rule, and then you

00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:58.450
can just apply that
to the expression.

00:36:58.450 --> 00:37:04.270
And in one line--
we'll have a plot.

00:37:04.270 --> 00:37:07.142
So we'll plot this
thing, mess that it is.

00:37:07.142 --> 00:37:08.850
Well, OK, why don't
we just call it here.

00:37:08.850 --> 00:37:12.400
The line is this, so we're
finding the best fit line here.

00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:19.220
And x goes from-- I
don't know-- 0 to 1.5,

00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:21.560
and that ought to do it for us.

00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:23.700
We'll plot that line, and
we'll plot these points.

00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:25.200
So we'll call it
points equals that,

00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:29.670
and we'll show the line
together with the points.

00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:34.700
And we'll also be able
show other things.

00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:36.440
PlotStyle Red.

00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:38.970
We'll make the line red
because that's real style.

00:37:38.970 --> 00:37:40.660
That's real style.

00:37:40.660 --> 00:37:43.070
That almost worked.

00:37:43.070 --> 00:37:43.620
There you go.

00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:44.980
So there's a line.

00:37:44.980 --> 00:37:46.200
What line is that?

00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:50.820
It's the line where-- the line.

00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:52.340
Please tell me the line.

00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:53.174
It's 0.69.

00:37:53.174 --> 00:37:53.840
So there you go.

00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:56.806
The slope here is 0.69.

00:37:56.806 --> 00:37:58.430
I mean, of course,
this is probably not

00:37:58.430 --> 00:38:00.250
valid down at these low numbers.

00:38:00.250 --> 00:38:08.480
But the point is that for
every additional 1% or one unit

00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:14.710
that you add, that's going to be
an extra 0.7 units that you're

00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:16.160
going to damage of your enemy.

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:19.710
And it's sort of fairly
linear between 1 and 5.

00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:21.740
Let's see if we really
dominate the enemy how

00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:24.340
the results will
sort of stack up.

00:38:24.340 --> 00:38:26.340
So here it's simulating
a whole bunch of combat,

00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:27.570
and it's going really slowly.

00:38:27.570 --> 00:38:28.450
Why is it going slowly?

00:38:28.450 --> 00:38:30.230
Well, because I put in
like that delay thing

00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:31.896
so that you could see
what was going on.

00:38:31.896 --> 00:38:33.510
So I'm going to
change the delay to 0

00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:35.468
and scroll right on back
down, giving everybody

00:38:35.468 --> 00:38:36.922
in the room nausea.

00:38:36.922 --> 00:38:38.630
There's also a bunch
of print statements.

00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:40.630
So we're seeing like 200
print statements, which

00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:42.620
was to print the dynamic
results of the match

00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:45.020
so that you could see them
fighting, sort of seeing

00:38:45.020 --> 00:38:48.050
numbers decrease on a board,
which is a lot like combat

00:38:48.050 --> 00:38:49.590
in the eyes of a nerd.

00:38:49.590 --> 00:38:51.720
So then we can see here
a bunch of force ratios.

00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:53.680
And here in this example,
we see that we're

00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:55.260
maxing out at a certain number.

00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:58.290
So according to the way that
I've set up this simulation,

00:38:58.290 --> 00:39:01.040
beyond a force
ratio of 2, you're

00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:02.630
not getting any
additional advantage

00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:05.760
out of your additional
troops because they just

00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:07.270
can't find a place to stand.

00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:11.160
In reality, when you have four
versus one or eight versus one,

00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:12.950
there's a place for
all of your eight guys

00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:15.560
to stand around all of
their one poor little guy.

00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:18.080
But if you have a
large number of units,

00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:20.130
it may be less realistic
to assume that there's

00:39:20.130 --> 00:39:22.140
that much room available
for them to double

00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:26.280
team, or quadruple team, or
eight-tuple team the enemy.

00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:28.486
So you could see here that
these are some results.

00:39:28.486 --> 00:39:29.860
And now if we plot
them again, we

00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:32.240
see that we sort of hit the
ceiling right over here,

00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:35.040
and so the line sort
of is totally destroyed

00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:37.890
and comes out wrong.

00:39:37.890 --> 00:39:40.670
Let's go up to 3 so we
see how bad-looking it is.

00:39:40.670 --> 00:39:42.170
And this is just
yet another example

00:39:42.170 --> 00:39:45.140
of how doing a best
fit line to something

00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:47.840
is not the right answer
100% of the time.

00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:50.874
It's the right answer
99.99% of the time.

00:39:50.874 --> 00:39:53.290
Or basically use the r squared
number to see if it's-- no,

00:39:53.290 --> 00:39:54.170
I'm just kidding.

00:39:54.170 --> 00:39:55.770
That's not genuine statistics.

00:39:55.770 --> 00:39:58.720
And most of you are
probably poo-pooing the idea

00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:01.480
that I even considered for
a moment or a nanosecond

00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:03.900
including the two words
in the same sentence.

00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:09.770
So that's a sort of
summary of these issues.

00:40:09.770 --> 00:40:12.440
Like what force ratio
gets you what unit or hit

00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:13.630
point kill ratio?

00:40:13.630 --> 00:40:17.680
You can see here a big takeaway
lesson that just 25% more units

00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:19.860
or just 30% more
units than the enemy

00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:21.350
can make a giant difference.

00:40:21.350 --> 00:40:23.840
And you should never engage
when you're outnumbered,

00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:25.790
unless you're right
next to the headquarters

00:40:25.790 --> 00:40:27.482
and there's no choice.

00:40:27.482 --> 00:40:29.065
I strongly recommend
that you consider

00:40:29.065 --> 00:40:31.470
the little micro-tricks,
trying to get

00:40:31.470 --> 00:40:33.590
your units into the
right place, withdrawing

00:40:33.590 --> 00:40:35.020
when it's a good idea.

00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:38.470
Remember that if you're
retreating from the enemy

00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:40.730
and the enemy is
adjacent to you,

00:40:40.730 --> 00:40:43.450
that means you can take
damage every turn while you're

00:40:43.450 --> 00:40:44.250
retreating.

00:40:44.250 --> 00:40:47.930
So in this game, retreating
is definitely not

00:40:47.930 --> 00:40:49.370
encouraged for that reason.

00:40:49.370 --> 00:40:51.380
What you need is
like allied units

00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:54.570
to sort of distract the enemy
while your injured ones are

00:40:54.570 --> 00:40:55.290
going to heal.

00:40:55.290 --> 00:40:57.960
Or you need to have your
medbays close enough

00:40:57.960 --> 00:40:59.490
that you can
survive the retreat.

00:40:59.490 --> 00:41:02.180
Because the way the
game works is, you move,

00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:03.620
and then you deal attack damage.

00:41:03.620 --> 00:41:05.120
So if you retreat
from your enemy,

00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:07.789
you're not adjacent to him
anymore after you've moved.

00:41:07.789 --> 00:41:09.705
And then he moves toward
you and deals damage.

00:41:09.705 --> 00:41:11.440
And then you retreat, and
you don't deal damage.

00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:13.148
And he moves toward
you and deals damage.

00:41:13.148 --> 00:41:14.820
And it's just a
very bad situation.

00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:16.030
I've been in it myself.

00:41:16.030 --> 00:41:17.930
It was very painful to watch.

00:41:17.930 --> 00:41:21.737
So with that, I mean,
I think that's going

00:41:21.737 --> 00:41:23.320
to be all that I've
got for you today,

00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:25.778
even though it's slightly early
on the days I've gone over.

00:41:25.778 --> 00:41:27.900
And so I recommend that
you just sort of sit

00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:30.290
here, enjoy yourselves,
ask me questions.

00:41:30.290 --> 00:41:32.730
And when the Bubble tea
arrives, the deputies

00:41:32.730 --> 00:41:33.900
will spring into action.

00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:37.385
So thank you very much
for coming to Lecture 6.

00:41:37.385 --> 00:41:42.080
I guess I should explain what's
going on in the next lectures.

00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:44.880
Next lecture is going to be
an exciting guest lecture,

00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:47.050
where we've got one of the
developers of Battlecode

00:41:47.050 --> 00:41:48.825
who's been remote and
who was the winner

00:41:48.825 --> 00:41:52.830
of Battlecode last year,
fun gamers, on that team.

00:41:52.830 --> 00:41:56.890
He's coming here to talk about
various important things.

00:41:56.890 --> 00:41:59.460
I forgot what he's--
oh, my goodness.

00:41:59.460 --> 00:42:02.040
What a terrible
plug for his talk.

00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:05.150
It was going to be about-- no,
that wasn't a helpful comment.

00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:07.450
That was just talking.

00:42:07.450 --> 00:42:11.810
Yeah, he's going to talk about,
I think, emergent complexity

00:42:11.810 --> 00:42:14.710
and like really awesome
tricks that you learn

00:42:14.710 --> 00:42:18.860
if you do Battlecode N years,
where N is a large number.
