00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.610
PROFESSOR: Alright,
and with that,

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.510
I think we'll be ready to
start on lecture seven.

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:33.350
Not really a lecture,
we're just talking

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.130
about lessons from
the Sprint Tournament.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.440
And you could whine and
complain about the map set

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.380
and I would totally support you.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.067
Because that map set was crazy.

00:00:44.067 --> 00:00:45.650
So, I'm just going
to have a seat here

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:50.020
and I'll bring up this little
Word document that I've got.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.780
Where we're going to talk
about a few aspects of maps,

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.840
a few aspects of teams.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.600
So let's zoom right on in.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.330
So, map dependent stuff,
which is written here.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.510
So, we saw a bunch of stuff that
really killed a bunch of teams.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.550
We had mines in
the way of spawn.

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.500
Make sure you check
that you don't

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.020
try to spawn a unit
on top of a mine.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.460
That's another thing, if a
unit is on top of a mine,

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.210
for whatever reason, he
should probably try to move.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.030
In previous years,
we've had spawn delays,

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.580
so that when a
unit is spawned it

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.330
can't move for a certain
number of rounds.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.520
But not this year, he
can move immediately.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.750
So if you're on top of a mine,
and you have a hit point number

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:33.030
x, and the defuse time is
y, and the number of rounds

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.644
it would take to kill you
with the mine doing damage z,

00:01:35.644 --> 00:01:37.060
you would just do
the math and see

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.160
whether it's worthwhile
to try to defuse it.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.980
Because you can't
have multiple units

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:43.480
defuse the mine on
different rounds.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.480
It doesn't continue
defusion progress.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:47.740
So anyway, they'll just die.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.240
And we saw some
real hero mines that

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.590
have been promoted
to Supreme Commander

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.440
and they're now commanding
fleets in the Pacific.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.940
Another thing was encampments.

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.510
So, sometimes the encampments
block off other things.

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:02.300
I mean, certainly we
saw a lot of teams

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.570
lose because they built
encampments around their base

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.150
and couldn't get out.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.864
OK, so it seems
like a dumb thing

00:02:07.864 --> 00:02:09.280
when you're looking
at it, but how

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.820
do you check for it in the code?

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:11.740
What's the best way?

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.410
I mean, it would be
obvious to just try

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.380
to maintain a diagonal line
straight from you to the enemy

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.290
and never lay
bases on that line.

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.310
But maybe that's the only base.

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.400
So, I don't know
exactly what the best

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.830
way around that
kind of problem is.

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.580
Yeah so, the encampments
can block each other off,

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.950
or you could block
off the enemy.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.220
We saw some of
them, you couldn't

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.360
get to those other ones.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.752
Let's see if I can
open up that map.

00:02:36.752 --> 00:02:39.210
Oh gosh, what are the chances
I'm going to be able to-- No,

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:40.360
the chances are zero.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.720
Yeah, I'll do it in
Paint because it's just

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:43.540
the general idea.

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.300
This was one of the
maps that I did design.

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.510
I didn't design all of them.

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.120
This was the one that
looked like-- Oh, I

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.662
guess I can just
use continual lines.

00:02:51.662 --> 00:02:54.078
Oh man, this is going to be
great, it's going to be great,

00:02:54.078 --> 00:02:55.190
I'm looking forward to it.

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.550
Yeah, it was just like that.

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.210
And then the encampments
where arranged a little bit

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.690
like this.

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:03.970
Yeah, yeah, it was like this.

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.470
These were the encampments and
they were connected this way.

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:07.678
So there was a pretty short--

00:03:07.678 --> 00:03:10.280
[STUTTERING]

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.670
Distance between Team A and B.
So, Team A and B were there.

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:21.170
We had hero mines H and H
that would kill entire armies.

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.024
Actually, I'd said
that they went on

00:03:23.024 --> 00:03:24.690
to be Supreme Commanders
in the Pacific,

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.590
but then they were subsequently
arrested for war crimes,

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.480
and executed.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.340
But their descendants live
on, the map is still there.

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.262
So there you have it, the
cycle of life and history.

00:03:35.262 --> 00:03:37.220
So anyway, the point that
I was trying to make,

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:38.860
before I confuse
myself here, was

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.210
that B would go ahead and
build a bunch of encampments

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:44.900
and then he wouldn't be able
to get to these ones back here.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.100
He couldn't get to them
because he couldn't find them.

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.820
So, that's definitely
something to worry about.

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.160
Maybe what you should
do is say, I'm just

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.200
sort of speaking off
the top my head here,

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.300
is if you can't get
there and you're a robot

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.150
and you're trying
to path around them,

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.430
maybe you should send
a signal to this fellow

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.780
that he should suicide, and
then the team should remember,

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.539
from now on into
the future of time,

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:10.580
that they shouldn't try
to build something there.

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.760
And then maybe that'll
be the new route

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.669
to the expansion of new
colonies and exploring space

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:17.835
for the benefit of humanity.

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:22.470
So, we see that they
can be blocked off,

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.030
don't know exactly how
to fix that problem.

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:32.110
We saw other issues,
like Team 0 or 116.

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.410
They shouted attack and
they died at round 2,002.

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.180
That was too sad.

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.490
I have the match here.

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:38.900
And it was like
they were cut off

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.860
and maybe that was an exception.

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.050
So, definitely want
to look for exceptions

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.230
that will take place
if you're cut off.

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:47.550
And maybe just communicate
to the other bases,

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:52.000
hey, I'm cut off,
please kill yourself.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.900
And I'm sure they'll comply.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.080
Luckily, Battlecode is
not like the actual world

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.580
where it would be really hard
to make that argument to them.

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.515
They're like, yeah,
but, but it's me.

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.680
I've heard a little bit
about rush distance.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.290
We had one map that
was called something

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:11.040
like, I don't remember
what it was called,

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.280
but we kept calling
it Bad Ideas.

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.380
Where the map was like this.

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.630
Oh man, that map was fantastic.

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:20.000
I didn't make this one.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.640
It had a big minefield
in the middle

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:27.330
and then there was a
and b located here.

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.460
And then on the very
edges of the map,

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:35.740
there were encampments
in these corners.

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:39.660
And so, the idea was that if
you actually take some of your,

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.390
you're pretty close
here, this distance

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:45.450
was, I don't know
15, or something.

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:48.140
And so, if you would send
your guys out in this way,

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:50.740
by the time you built the
encampment-- first of all,

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.540
you're losing soldiers,
second they're

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:54.249
not going to help you
defend, the enemy's

00:05:54.249 --> 00:05:55.748
just going to go
ahead and kill you.

00:05:55.748 --> 00:05:57.470
So, if you see this
distance, I mean,

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:01.110
I think a decent set
of heuristics for a map

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:02.980
should be the following.

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:06.650
Here's map heuristics.

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:08.730
[SLOWLY SPELLS HEURISTICS]

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:11.990
I think that you could
say, distance to enemy

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:17.740
and distance to
closest encampment.

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:20.070
[SLOWLY SPELLS ENCAMPMENT]

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:23.099
And then you could do, I
guess that's pretty much

00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:23.640
all you need.

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.890
Because I think, distance
to enemy is unimportant.

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:30.250
What you should do
is number of mines

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:33.240
to the enemy and that
encapsulates distance.

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.430
And so, then you could be like,
OK, if this distance is big

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:38.880
and this number is
small, then there you go.

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:42.820
So, all you've got to do is say,
that number minus that number.

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:44.930
And now, you're starting
to have something

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:48.480
that you can compare to if
it's big, if this quantity is

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.880
greater than some number,
then do something.

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.420
Anyway, you guys get the idea.

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:56.650
We had a couple of maps where
we had lanes next to the mines.

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:58.010
I think we do that quite a bit.

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:00.050
Some of the maps that we
gave you initially, you

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:01.880
could just walk
straight to the enemy

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.590
if you path around the mines.

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:07.680
And the lanes weren't that
complicated, all you have to do

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:10.240
is make one little turn and
then you're going straight

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.970
to the enemy, all the way.

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:14.490
And we saw some teams
use this, but we also

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:17.844
saw them put
encampments on the lanes

00:07:17.844 --> 00:07:19.260
and then they
couldn't walk there.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:24.920
I think there was one very
critical match and that match

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:27.120
went something like this.

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:28.752
Are some of you
obsessive compulsive?

00:07:28.752 --> 00:07:30.960
You're get a little bit
annoyed by these little bits?

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:32.386
OK, there you go.

00:07:32.386 --> 00:07:34.010
I think on the map
that I'm describing,

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:36.990
it had these late like this.

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:39.210
And so, these are the
mines that I'm drawing

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:42.260
and then between those
we saw the encampments

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:43.750
that you could capture.

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:46.125
Some I'm just going to make
it slightly more symmetrical.

00:07:46.125 --> 00:07:50.130
We had Team a over here
and Team b over here.

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:53.320
And the teams were just lined
up exactly with the mines.

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:55.089
So, that if you counted
the mines directly

00:07:55.089 --> 00:07:57.130
between you and the enemy,
it was a large number,

00:07:57.130 --> 00:08:00.580
but if you counted this
number, it was a zero number.

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:02.939
So what Team a started
doing, and I'll just

00:08:02.939 --> 00:08:05.230
recap because not all of you
will have seen that match,

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:08.140
is they started defusing
these mines this way,

00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:10.810
but simultaneously, they
were capturing encampments.

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:13.930
So, I believe they
didn't think that there

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:15.970
was a straight
path to the enemy.

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:17.880
Because whenever they
captured something,

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:20.700
they also got these
as soon as possible,

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:22.540
so they could never
really get around.

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:25.250
And simultaneously,
B was building up

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:29.660
a minefield and
researching nuke.

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:32.250
Yeah, nukes for the win.

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:33.750
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:36.809
PROFESSOR: So, I think
it was pretty weird.

00:08:36.809 --> 00:08:40.200
We ended up seeing, I
guess you could classify it

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:44.169
as almost three
strategies, there's a rush,

00:08:44.169 --> 00:08:48.900
there's an econ strategy, and
then there's a nuke strategy.

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:51.307
There's overlap, of
course, but it almost

00:08:51.307 --> 00:08:52.890
seems like there are
three strategies.

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:55.360
In this map, for
this particular map,

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:57.974
we saw that econ-- he's
building these encampments,

00:08:57.974 --> 00:09:00.140
if he didn't build those
he would have gone straight

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:02.765
to the enemy, it would have been
great-- this econ strategy was

00:09:02.765 --> 00:09:03.960
defeated by the nuke.

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.570
So, I'm just going
to do an arrow.

00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:10.980
Econ on a large map would
kill a rush and on a small map

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:12.670
a rush would kill a nuke.

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:14.360
Is this Rock, Paper, Scissors?

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:19.160
No, but given a map set it can
be rock, paper, scissors, e.

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:20.640
It could be scissors, e.

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.780
Anyway, the point
is that whenever

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:26.090
we have something like
this, if you're not

00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:28.920
taking into account the maps,
so that it's just picking it

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:31.200
at random, then one
result that you get

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:35.860
is the tournament
can not make sense.

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:41.050
It's more than just some
simple concept in your head,

00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:43.010
that the tournament
isn't making sense.

00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:45.190
Because the basis
of a tournament

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:48.430
is that when it's done you
know who's the best, right.

00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:51.190
It's supposed to be
that teams, they've

00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:55.200
got a fundamental goodness,
and that the top team is best.

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:57.790
But if you have three teams,
rock, paper, and scissors,

00:09:57.790 --> 00:10:01.874
and you hold a tournament, what
is the point of the tournament?

00:10:01.874 --> 00:10:04.290
You're not to find anything
out at the end and, of course,

00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:05.630
you all know this.

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:08.457
And my point is that you
feel it so viscerally

00:10:08.457 --> 00:10:09.540
when it ends up happening.

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:11.850
So, the only solution
is to use that map data

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:14.130
and to say, OK, I
know it's a short map,

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:16.596
or I know it's a large map, or
something along those lines.

00:10:16.596 --> 00:10:18.220
That's the only thing
you've got to do.

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:19.594
And I'm very
confident that we're

00:10:19.594 --> 00:10:22.299
going to see a whole lot of
that in the following matches.

00:10:22.299 --> 00:10:24.090
Not in the ones we're
going to watch today,

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:25.840
in the ones that are
going to be submitted

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:28.790
to the subsequent tournaments.

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:31.160
So, we saw the lanes
next to the mines.

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:35.330
We saw some really good
positioning of artillery.

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:37.390
It made the difference
between victory and loss

00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:38.410
in a lot of cases.

00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:40.170
And I'd like to
point out, especially

00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:43.160
in the presence of
my simulator here,

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:45.760
that a little artillery
can go a long way.

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:47.490
So, I don't know
how many of you have

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:51.000
had a chance to look at the
latest update of my Battlecode

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.600
simulator, but it works
the following way.

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:55.640
So here, I'm going to
compare two strategies.

00:10:55.640 --> 00:11:00.090
This strategy is to build robots
and no generators or suppliers

00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:02.180
and this strategy
is just to continue

00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:05.940
building two stands
for a supplier.

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:09.214
So, there you can see the
first strategy is in green.

00:11:09.214 --> 00:11:10.130
How does that show up?

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:11.000
That shows up pretty well.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.090
First strategy in green is
to just build the soldiers

00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:14.180
and you hit the maximum.

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:15.850
And then, the second
strategy here,

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:18.830
you can see now in this updated
version of this Battlecode

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:22.660
simulator, that you
actually do lose some units.

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:25.120
You lose units that
you would have had,

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:27.610
those soldiers are destroyed
in capturing the encampments.

00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:29.110
And then, you only
pay it off later.

00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:31.700
So, here you see the
150 rounds, or so,

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:35.820
between starting to buy those
things and having it pay off.

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:37.880
And you can similarly
see that that round

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:39.200
number is going to change.

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:41.830
If you only build
two of these things,

00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:43.855
it's going to be quite
different and, well, I

00:11:43.855 --> 00:11:45.980
guess it ends up paying
off at about the same time.

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:47.860
That's curious,
that's pretty curious,

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:52.600
but I'm sure its basis in fact.

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:54.580
Let's just double check here.

00:11:54.580 --> 00:12:00.890
The suppliers do reduce
your spawn delay.

00:12:00.890 --> 00:12:02.990
So, here on the left,
I've provided a table.

00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:04.820
And this is all available
on the internet.

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:07.180
So, you don't need
Mathematica, because I did also

00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:08.470
save this is a PDF.

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:10.970
But you can make this
yourself in Microsoft Excel,

00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:13.511
or something like that, where
you see the number of suppliers

00:12:13.511 --> 00:12:16.610
on the left, going
from zero up on through

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:18.230
to some incredibly large number.

00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:20.680
Which we did see in this
tournament, if you guys saw.

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:23.230
I really love to watch
some of those macro games.

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:26.180
And then, we see on the old
spec what the spawn delay would

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:28.250
have been and then
the latest spec.

00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:33.810
So, the spec used to be
10 times 0.95 to the n,

00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:35.520
where n is the
number of suppliers.

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:40.100
The latest spec is 100
divided by 10 plus n.

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:43.240
So, the effect is that now,
with the latest spawn delay,

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:45.290
we go down from 10 faster.

00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:48.240
So, you see here, we're at six
when the old one was at seven.

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:49.820
But later on we're higher.

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:53.039
So, we level off much sooner.

00:12:53.039 --> 00:12:55.330
And so, we're at two here
when the other one is at one.

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:58.670
So, there's a crossover and it's
favoring getting them earlier.

00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:00.740
Anyway, my point is
we can go with number

00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:02.440
of suppliers and
the spawn delay.

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:04.440
So, when I get one
supplier I should

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:07.610
see a spawn delay
that improves by one.

00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:09.770
And so, you can say,
OK, the headquarters

00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:11.550
is producing hit
points per round.

00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:13.710
That's the point of
the headquarters.

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:16.570
I mean, sure number of
units is a different metric

00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:17.820
than number of hit points.

00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:19.840
Because units deal
damage, not hit points,

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:23.460
but it's similar because you're
dealing damage and taking

00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:24.502
damage, and there you go.

00:13:24.502 --> 00:13:26.960
It's all a question of micro
when you get right down to it,

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:28.850
it's all very clear
and straightforward.

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:30.490
So, hit points
per round is four.

00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:32.430
If you build a single artillery.

00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:35.490
OK, you build a single
supplier, now your spawn delay

00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:39.340
is nine so you're producing 4.4
repeating hit points per round.

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:42.760
So, that's an additional 0.4
repeating hit points per round.

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:44.980
That's what you've got out
of building that supplier.

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:46.390
You got this.

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:48.730
And the next one you
build will get you this.

00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:51.172
I mean, if you build this
one, you get even more.

00:13:51.172 --> 00:13:53.630
I mean, some of them that you
build don't get you anything.

00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:55.713
So, you can see, incremental
hit points per round.

00:13:55.713 --> 00:13:58.710
But look, all these numbers,
none of them are that big.

00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:01.660
Whereas, if you got
something like an artillery,

00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:04.064
it can get you a large number
of hit points per round.

00:14:04.064 --> 00:14:05.730
Because really what
you're interested in

00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:07.359
is not just hit
points for your team,

00:14:07.359 --> 00:14:08.900
it's the difference
between your team

00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:10.150
and the enemy team hit points.

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:12.990
So if you build artillery
that does get shots off,

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:16.480
I mean, if it
shoots all the time,

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:19.180
then it's going to be dealing
40 damage every 20 turns.

00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:21.000
And that's infinity, isn't it?

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.320
That's 40, 40 over, that's
two hit point per turn.

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:24.885
That's a lot.

00:14:24.885 --> 00:14:26.260
I mean, of course,
it's not going

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.710
to do that because a lot of
the time it isn't shooting.

00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:31.910
But if it's shooting only
20 percent of the time,

00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:35.691
then it's two times one
fifth and now you have 0.4.

00:14:35.691 --> 00:14:37.440
So, it's starting to
be competitive to get

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:40.960
an artillery compared
to a supplier.

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:43.020
So that's just one way
of looking at things.

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:45.680
Definitely worth thinking
about, I should say.

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:47.666
Because one of these
artilleries can be,

00:14:47.666 --> 00:14:50.040
as we've seen in some of these
matches, worth its weight.

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:52.575
So now, the question is, is
this code working properly?

00:14:52.575 --> 00:14:54.200
And I think the answer
is no, actually,

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:55.360
in characteristic fashion.

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:58.132
So, here I built one supplier
and the production rate

00:14:58.132 --> 00:15:00.090
of robots is approximately
identical to the way

00:15:00.090 --> 00:15:00.870
that it was.

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:02.990
So I'm just going to
debug this a second.

00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:03.810
Let's see here.

00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:05.976
I think we have
here, OK, so that's

00:15:05.976 --> 00:15:07.850
the supplier number
there and the question is

00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:09.680
if that supplier
number is there,

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:13.740
and the spawn time is being
updated, then why wouldn't it

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:14.570
take effect.

00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:16.850
Because that certainly does
look like the latest spec.

00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:19.120
Well, in any case, I think
it will be safe for us just

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:22.480
to start with one and that's
a decent fudge factor.

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:23.220
Let's do that.

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:27.270
Let's start with-- Oh my god,
I'm terrible, terrible person.

00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:28.319
Let's see it happen.

00:15:28.319 --> 00:15:29.360
I'll figure it out later.

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:31.443
So there, now we see a
little bit of a difference.

00:15:31.443 --> 00:15:33.754
And we get the second
one that should have, OK,

00:15:33.754 --> 00:15:34.670
that had a big effect.

00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:36.005
Was it supposed to?

00:15:36.005 --> 00:15:36.505
It was.

00:15:36.505 --> 00:15:38.820
The third one should
have no effect.

00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:40.370
Let's just double check that.

00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:42.120
And then, what we're
going to end up doing

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:43.540
is we'll watch some matches.

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:45.490
OK, so let's go
back to having two.

00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:47.160
And now, we'll go
to having three.

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:49.450
And yeah, the slope
didn't change.

00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:49.880
I don't think the slope changed.

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:51.490
It just moved left
and right because we

00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:52.500
had to lose another soldier.

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:53.230
So, that's good.

00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:55.730
I think there was
just an offset of one.

00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:59.450
I guess that makes perfect
sense to me for some reason.

00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:00.630
Yeah, I'll understand it.

00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:02.944
In fact, let's pretend
I understand it now.

00:16:02.944 --> 00:16:04.360
It's just a question
of when we're

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:07.030
pretending I'm understanding
it, not a question of whether.

00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:09.990
Alright, so, let's
go ahead and watch

00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:11.540
some matches because
I really want

00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:14.430
to illustrate a few interesting
things about mines, and micro,

00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:16.500
and so on.

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:17.570
So let's go.

00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:18.655
All of you can do it.

00:16:18.655 --> 00:16:20.030
I don't know if
you've seen this,

00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:21.540
but you simply go
to Tournaments,

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:23.832
and you go to Results, and
you click on Sprint Bracket,

00:16:23.832 --> 00:16:25.248
and now you have
access to all the

00:16:25.248 --> 00:16:26.540
matches that you can download.

00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:30.364
I mean it's not as great as
being able to, for example,

00:16:30.364 --> 00:16:33.030
get everybody else's code so you
can play against it infinitely,

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:34.250
but it's pretty good.

00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:39.410
And you can also convert this
match data into XML files

00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:42.030
that you can parse
to find matches

00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:43.530
that match a certain
characteristic.

00:16:43.530 --> 00:16:46.320
For instance, let's
just do an example.

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:48.550
I guess we'll just
pick any random match,

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:50.040
let's pick the final match.

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:52.114
Oh, I don't know, the
final match was-- I mean,

00:16:52.114 --> 00:16:53.530
I think what ended
up happening is

00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:57.480
we started having teams that
rushed get to the finals.

00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:59.320
And I think that
was map dependent.

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:02.953
In the future, it may be
less so that rush teams are

00:17:02.953 --> 00:17:04.369
really making it
up to the finals.

00:17:04.369 --> 00:17:06.630
And there may be other,
like an econ team--

00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:09.510
We see one of the best econ
teams here, hey I just met you,

00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:11.810
was actually a cross
between rush and econ.

00:17:11.810 --> 00:17:15.839
We saw them, sometimes, build
absolutely massive numbers

00:17:15.839 --> 00:17:20.200
of macro buildings, and
other times we saw them not.

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:21.878
I see one question.

00:17:21.878 --> 00:17:24.579
AUDIENCE: Are you going to have
best of five matches later?

00:17:24.579 --> 00:17:25.829
PROFESSOR: Mr. Pipe Nexus?

00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:27.530
AUDIENCE: Best of five matches.

00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:29.150
PROFESSOR: Oh, best
of five matches.

00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:31.660
That's been introduced
as a concept.

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:33.180
Sorry about my misunderstanding.

00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:35.750
Best of five matches
may be introduced later,

00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:38.350
but it's still on
the table because it

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:41.062
would require a large reworking
of our tournament code.

00:17:41.062 --> 00:17:42.520
Because, of course,
we write things

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:44.520
in the most flexible and
reusable way possible.

00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:45.954
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:17:45.954 --> 00:17:47.866
And the question
about the previous one

00:17:47.866 --> 00:17:50.740
that the suppliers
cost upkeep, right?

00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:53.254
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
I think they do.

00:17:53.254 --> 00:17:54.920
We can actually go
straight into a match

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:56.380
and just double check that.

00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:57.963
Because all we have
to do is go to one

00:17:57.963 --> 00:18:00.030
of those matches where
one of the teams walls

00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:02.140
itself in and just look at that.

00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:05.499
Because then they have
suppliers, but not soldiers.

00:18:05.499 --> 00:18:06.540
So, let's go to that one.

00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:08.740
I think I have it
loaded already.

00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:10.450
Those poor fellows.

00:18:10.450 --> 00:18:13.600
I'm sorry Team 0, I'm
sorry, but here you go.

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:18.560
They have a supplier
and they are team 116.

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:21.340
And they're steady
at 225 resources.

00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:23.729
Whereas, I don't
know, is that more

00:18:23.729 --> 00:18:26.020
than they would be spending
if they were doing nothing?

00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:28.050
I think it might be.

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:31.430
There's a chance
that it could be.

00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:33.030
I'm going to go with yes.

00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:34.980
But that's a guess.

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:36.570
I don't know.

00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:37.280
I don't know.

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:38.350
It probably is.

00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:41.042
It probably takes upkeep.

00:18:41.042 --> 00:18:42.418
I guess that's
another thing that

00:18:42.418 --> 00:18:43.708
may be wrong with my simulator.

00:18:43.708 --> 00:18:45.510
Anyway, I'm tired of
saying that I'm wrong.

00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:46.801
Let's talk about how I'm right.

00:18:46.801 --> 00:18:47.600
Come on.

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:49.110
Come on guys.

00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:51.680
Alright, so let's
open up a match.

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:56.600
I want to start before teams
that are rushing are winning.

00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:58.100
Citizen Snips, for
example, I think,

00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:00.780
was doing some decent macro.

00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:02.120
So, let's open that one up.

00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:04.340
I think I was pretty
impressed with that team.

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:07.312
There were also some teams
that were brand new that

00:19:07.312 --> 00:19:08.770
came from the bottom
of the ladder.

00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:11.126
And I think we'll have
a chance today to talk

00:19:11.126 --> 00:19:12.500
about those a
little bit as well.

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:14.166
So, I'm just going
to make sure that I'm

00:19:14.166 --> 00:19:16.590
looking at the latest one.

00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:17.707
Oh man, please sort them.

00:19:17.707 --> 00:19:19.290
Would you mind sorting
them, computer?

00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:20.186
Thank you.

00:19:20.186 --> 00:19:23.160
Man, I tell you, there's a
problem with subordination

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:24.180
these times.

00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:28.370
So yeah, we see Team Snips, on
the right, is getting vision.

00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:30.890
Vision was not a
very popular upgrade,

00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:34.370
but they're building these
artillery in the front,

00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:36.710
and then they're building
supplier in the back.

00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:39.430
I think that a pretty
interesting approach.

00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:42.290
And because of the
map layout, they're

00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:44.800
ending up using the
artillery quite a bit.

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:47.570
So, we see a good shot
there, it's not bad.

00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:50.700
It does seem to
deal some damage.

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:52.920
No, it deals no damage
to allied units.

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:53.740
So that's great.

00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:55.469
But I think later on
we might see, yeah,

00:19:55.469 --> 00:19:57.260
I don't know if that
was such a great shot.

00:19:57.260 --> 00:20:00.540
Because we took out two
enemies at the cost of two

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:01.910
allied units.

00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:05.387
So, I don't know, that seemed
like breaking even in my eyes.

00:20:05.387 --> 00:20:06.970
So, there's something
you can do there

00:20:06.970 --> 00:20:10.120
with writing artillery code
to try to avoid allied units.

00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:13.370
Maybe, I don't know, you
shoot at-- You could literally

00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:16.500
compute the value of every tile,
but it seems pretty expensive.

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:18.992
So, I'm not sure exactly what
the best way to do that is.

00:20:18.992 --> 00:20:21.200
So, we see them getting
vision, one of the rare teams

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:22.020
to get vision.

00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:24.520
And we see them upgrading
that, interlaced

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:27.120
with building their other robots
and their other structures.

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:29.834
So, I don't know how I
feel about interlacing

00:20:29.834 --> 00:20:30.750
one thing and another.

00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:33.760
So, I guess the idea
is that it's not

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:35.830
quite as fast as
researching it straight out,

00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:38.940
but it's not quite
as slow as getting it

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:40.240
after you get all your robots.

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:43.180
But actually, when it
comes right down to it,

00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:46.750
if you build, let's get
out a simple program here,

00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:48.430
such as Paint.

00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:54.700
If you build four robots,
1, 2, 3, and 4, and you

00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:58.260
research 25%, which I'll
indicate as maybe there's

00:20:58.260 --> 00:20:59.700
a completion bar.

00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:03.430
And you research, I don't know,
this much, and then this much,

00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:05.600
and then this much,
and then you're done.

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:07.590
How is that any different
from researching,

00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:10.950
from getting robot,
robot, robot, robot,

00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:13.646
and then getting
out the full bar?

00:21:13.646 --> 00:21:15.270
I don't think it's
incredibly different

00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:17.580
and it may be just that it
gives you more flexibility

00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:19.220
to make decisions part way.

00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:21.909
Because maybe if
you do this thing,

00:21:21.909 --> 00:21:23.450
which I should change
the color here.

00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:25.870
Maybe if you get three of
these straight out then

00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:28.094
now you're fixed
and you can't finish

00:21:28.094 --> 00:21:29.510
this for a certain
amount of time.

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:32.150
Whereas here, you give
yourself more flexibility

00:21:32.150 --> 00:21:33.790
to cancel this part way through.

00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:35.790
But I just feel like this
is the stronger move.

00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:39.370
Because if you go up against
this team versus that team,

00:21:39.370 --> 00:21:42.900
then if there's an engagement
at time, this time,

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:45.990
then right then and there you're
going to have four on three.

00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:47.970
And so, when it
comes down to here,

00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:50.620
you're going to
have two guys left

00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:52.210
and he's going to have one guy.

00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:54.737
And it's going to be pretty
clear who's going to win.

00:21:54.737 --> 00:21:56.320
And it doesn't matter
that both of you

00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:57.445
have this stuff at the end.

00:21:57.445 --> 00:21:59.590
It's just not going
to matter, so I

00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:01.480
don't know how I feel
about the interlacing.

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:02.900
So, we see a bunch of that.

00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:05.620
And we also see
here that Team 70

00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:09.640
is a team that either rushes,
or goes for a heavy macro play.

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:11.480
And I get the feeling
that on this map,

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:14.790
they've decided that the rush
distance, the distance from one

00:22:14.790 --> 00:22:16.720
team to the other, is not huge.

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:17.680
It's not that big.

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:20.750
And so, and there aren't
that many mines either.

00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:24.870
So, I think this is the reason
why they're doing this rush.

00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:27.350
I think it's pretty impressive
that even though they're

00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:31.810
down on units, pretty often we
see two units from blue and one

00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:34.020
unit from red,
nevertheless, red is

00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:38.160
able to hold off
this blue attack.

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:43.040
I think Team 70 has some
really excellent micro.

00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:47.610
And I will remind you that
Team 70 has one author who

00:22:47.610 --> 00:22:50.730
was a former member
of a team with Corey.

00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:52.620
Who spoke yesterday at lecture.

00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:54.990
And you remember that Corey
talked all about micro.

00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:57.594
Micro being the important
thing that wins matches.

00:22:57.594 --> 00:22:59.260
We're going to see
that again and again.

00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:00.730
You saw that the
Sprint Tournament.

00:23:00.730 --> 00:23:02.800
And I have ways of
indicating again to you,

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:06.260
in video that we watch today,
that that was incredibly key

00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:08.010
in a lot of circumstances.

00:23:08.010 --> 00:23:08.867
We saw that happen.

00:23:08.867 --> 00:23:10.450
And so, it makes
perfect sense that we

00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:12.870
would see red have
some really good micro.

00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:14.550
But at the same
time, he's not going

00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:17.320
to make any inroads against this
player who's doing artillery.

00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:19.620
And you've got to wonder
whether that's detectable.

00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:22.457
Whether he can tell that
he's dying to artillery.

00:23:22.457 --> 00:23:24.040
And whether he can
tell the main base,

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:26.150
hey, this is our
artillery, so we've

00:23:26.150 --> 00:23:27.690
got basically two choices.

00:23:27.690 --> 00:23:31.000
One, we bunch up a
lot of units and we

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.780
make sure we attack all at
once and spread out enough

00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:36.190
so we're not taking splash
damage from that artillery.

00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:38.890
Or, we've got to get
shields, or we've

00:23:38.890 --> 00:23:40.480
got to do a massive econ play.

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:42.570
Basically, we've got
those three choices.

00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:45.910
And neither of those choices,
neither of those three,

00:23:45.910 --> 00:23:48.350
are among the choice
of just simply sending

00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:50.140
one unit at a time.

00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:51.090
So, I think a lot--

00:23:51.090 --> 00:23:52.720
Now see, did you
see that happen?

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:54.200
That's pretty surprising.

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:58.140
You see the enemy attack
and you see red outnumbered.

00:23:58.140 --> 00:24:00.790
So, this is two
enemies to one red.

00:24:00.790 --> 00:24:03.470
OK, and the two
enemies are grouping

00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:05.056
around the enemy headquarters.

00:24:05.056 --> 00:24:06.680
Because they're not
really prioritizing

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:08.620
attacking that one red guy.

00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:12.710
They're just going toward
the enemy, it seems.

00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:14.740
It's not, I mean,
it's not that obvious

00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:17.140
that they're
prioritizing enemy units.

00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:19.015
So what ends up happening
is this one red guy

00:24:19.015 --> 00:24:21.730
is managing to kite and
attack only one blue guy.

00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:23.360
See that?

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:25.304
And, I guess, there's
probably awesome stuff

00:24:25.304 --> 00:24:27.470
that you could read in their
indicator strings here.

00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:29.310
Remember that when we
show the tournament,

00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:31.220
the indicator string
bar is not there.

00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:33.230
That's just not part of
the tournament viewer.

00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:35.470
But if you watch the replay,
you can read their indicator

00:24:35.470 --> 00:24:37.969
strings and you might learn
some about what those robots are

00:24:37.969 --> 00:24:39.780
trying to think about,
or trying to do.

00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:42.267
So, here you see the red is
really kiting these guys.

00:24:42.267 --> 00:24:43.850
And he's almost using
his headquarters

00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:45.850
as a defensive structure.

00:24:45.850 --> 00:24:47.560
You can see here,
he's almost come back

00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:50.070
because he's got two units
and this guy's capturing

00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:52.100
an encampment and you
can't cancel that.

00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:54.949
So, he's almost
recovering here and just

00:24:54.949 --> 00:24:55.990
through the use of micro.

00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:57.270
I think it's very impressive.

00:24:57.270 --> 00:25:00.000
And it's only because he
walks into that artillery fire

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.250
again that it seems like
he has some trouble.

00:25:02.250 --> 00:25:05.880
I mean, there are multiple ways
of reading the system, reading

00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:07.582
what happened in this match.

00:25:07.582 --> 00:25:09.290
But, I think that was
pretty interesting.

00:25:09.290 --> 00:25:11.780
This is one of the only
shields that we ever see.

00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:14.510
I don't see any reason why blue
would have decided to build it,

00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:16.759
especially in this location,
especially given this guy

00:25:16.759 --> 00:25:19.170
has no artillery, especially,
especially, especially.

00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:22.910
So, I think this game's
pretty much foregone.

00:25:22.910 --> 00:25:25.780
And I think this one
is also foregone.

00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:27.800
OK, here's a great example.

00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:29.980
So he has built three suppliers.

00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:32.600
OK, three suppliers
out of Team 216.

00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:34.890
And there you go, he has 180.

00:25:34.890 --> 00:25:37.337
Whereas, at the beginning, I
think you were stable at 194.

00:25:37.337 --> 00:25:39.670
So there we have our definitive
answer to that question.

00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:42.730
I think you are stable at 194,
so these do take hit point,

00:25:42.730 --> 00:25:44.917
they do take and upkeep,
these supplier units

00:25:44.917 --> 00:25:46.000
that he does end up doing.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:46.680
So, that's good.

00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:47.940
That makes me feel happy.

00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:49.315
So that goes on
to a round three.

00:25:49.315 --> 00:25:51.576
I mean, yeah, you've
got to check that.

00:25:51.576 --> 00:25:53.450
OK, I've said it before,
don't want to repeat

00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:54.240
myself, very good.

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:57.515
So, Team 70, both teams are
deciding this is a macro map.

00:25:57.515 --> 00:25:59.140
Pretty interesting,
because once again,

00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:01.170
we saw team 70 not do macro.

00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:03.770
But look at this, he's not
running straight for macro.

00:26:03.770 --> 00:26:05.340
He's got this decision in mind.

00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:07.450
That's one generator
and four suppliers.

00:26:07.450 --> 00:26:11.110
Wow, let's just rewind, just
rewind just a little bit,

00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:12.790
just a little bit right now.

00:26:12.790 --> 00:26:14.920
So yeah, he's getting
the generator first

00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:15.980
and then those three.

00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:18.020
Meanwhile, he's getting fusion.

00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:19.250
He's already got fusion.

00:26:19.250 --> 00:26:21.420
And I think he
prioritizes that upgrade.

00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:23.910
It's pretty strange because
you see him, I think,

00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:25.980
get it before even
is first unit.

00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:27.730
So here, we're
looking at round 20.

00:26:27.730 --> 00:26:30.510
Round 15,16, 17, he still
hasn't built a unit.

00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:32.526
Whereas, blue has built
two units already.

00:26:32.526 --> 00:26:34.400
It's questionable whether
prioritizing fusion

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:37.550
is going to be that good,
because he prioritizes

00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:39.920
fusion but then doesn't
actually use all that energy.

00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:41.640
He's still at 1,600.

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:43.320
Does he ever actually use it?

00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:43.960
Maybe.

00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:45.100
It's going to be later.

00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:47.900
And this team could
be even more powerful

00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:50.294
than it was, perhaps,
if it perhaps

00:26:50.294 --> 00:26:51.460
did that a little bit later.

00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:53.920
So yeah, let's go back and
let's think about this.

00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:56.730
Because this set
up here is meant

00:26:56.730 --> 00:26:59.130
to strike at a certain time.

00:26:59.130 --> 00:27:01.042
And the time when
he's meant to strike,

00:27:01.042 --> 00:27:03.000
imagine setting up this
way, where you're like,

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.290
OK, I know that depending on
the number of macro buildings

00:27:06.290 --> 00:27:08.490
I build, that will give
me an attack timing.

00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:10.400
Where it'll be the
perfect moment for me

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:12.566
to attack because I'm just
running out of resources,

00:27:12.566 --> 00:27:14.380
I'm just hitting
the peak of units.

00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:16.900
Well, maybe that attack
timing should exactly

00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:18.430
match how long I
estimate it will

00:27:18.430 --> 00:27:20.072
take for me to get to the enemy.

00:27:20.072 --> 00:27:21.530
Now, you could use
the headquarters

00:27:21.530 --> 00:27:24.480
to say, to just
calculate explicitly,

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:26.530
it will take me this
long to get the enemy,

00:27:26.530 --> 00:27:28.700
I had better have some
macro up by that time.

00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:30.500
And that could be
exactly what he's doing.

00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:32.300
So, let's do a little
check in Mathematica,

00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:35.387
where we'll say he's going to
build four of these suppliers

00:27:35.387 --> 00:27:36.970
and he's going to
build one generator.

00:27:36.970 --> 00:27:39.260
So there, we see that
he's going to cross over

00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:41.820
and he's going to be even
with the enemy at 200.

00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:44.410
So, let's hope that he attacks
the enemy closer to 300.

00:27:44.410 --> 00:27:45.530
Let's see what happens.

00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:47.207
So there, he's just pausing.

00:27:47.207 --> 00:27:48.290
All his units are pausing.

00:27:48.290 --> 00:27:51.310
It's round 269, they're
not doing anything.

00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:53.960
It's round 300, they're
still not doing anything.

00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:56.810
I guess it's because he's taking
more bases that he's decided,

00:27:56.810 --> 00:28:00.060
OK, I have something,
that's a lot of units.

00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:01.890
I'm pretty sure this
is a defensive move.

00:28:01.890 --> 00:28:03.431
That he's just going
to move out here

00:28:03.431 --> 00:28:05.870
and he's expecting
these to defend him.

00:28:05.870 --> 00:28:07.690
Unfortunately,
that's not exactly

00:28:07.690 --> 00:28:09.554
on the midpoint
between the two armies.

00:28:09.554 --> 00:28:11.970
And you've got to wonder whether
that's a deliberate idea,

00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:14.400
or whether he's chosen
to go in this direction

00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:15.702
for some other reason.

00:28:15.702 --> 00:28:17.910
Because we're going to see
blue go ahead and take out

00:28:17.910 --> 00:28:19.470
a lot of those
bases, a lot of that

00:28:19.470 --> 00:28:21.060
stuff that he had on the bottom.

00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:25.620
So, we see once again
that red ends up using,

00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:27.520
and does in most
of his matches, he

00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:31.910
ends up using his reinforcing
stream as a defensive tool.

00:28:31.910 --> 00:28:33.760
If he didn't have
that stream of units

00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:35.830
continually coming
out of the base,

00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:37.810
there's no way he would
be able to defend this.

00:28:37.810 --> 00:28:39.351
Because these guys
are not programmed

00:28:39.351 --> 00:28:41.520
to turn around and come back.

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:45.120
Once again, blue has this
great, look at this positioning.

00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:47.956
I think it's probably not
just great positioning.

00:28:47.956 --> 00:28:49.830
It's probably just that
every other time he's

00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:50.913
building one or the other.

00:28:50.913 --> 00:28:52.580
Because we see another
artillery here,

00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:55.480
and here, and here, and
here, and here, whereas red

00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:57.210
has not built a
single artillery.

00:28:57.210 --> 00:29:00.040
So the question is,
is it the building

00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:01.700
of one thing or
another that has made

00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:03.080
the difference in this match?

00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:05.360
Because we're
starting to see red

00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:08.400
is starting to get
a lot more units.

00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:11.410
And that artillery is
not always shooting.

00:29:11.410 --> 00:29:13.775
So, I think it's a
pretty open question

00:29:13.775 --> 00:29:15.150
whether it was
actually worth it.

00:29:15.150 --> 00:29:16.880
Because in this long
match, it ends up

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:20.110
being that red prevails.

00:29:20.110 --> 00:29:24.290
So yeah, I mean, that's
pretty interesting how red

00:29:24.290 --> 00:29:26.530
has got a relatively
simple move.

00:29:26.530 --> 00:29:28.370
He's just picking rush or econ.

00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:30.370
And when he goes econ,
he goes econ all the way,

00:29:30.370 --> 00:29:31.960
and when he goes rush,
he goes rush all the way,

00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:33.210
and his micro is fantastic.

00:29:33.210 --> 00:29:36.890
And those little things alone,
little, though I may call them,

00:29:36.890 --> 00:29:38.300
are really significant.

00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:42.270
OK, so that's spending a
long time on just one match.

00:29:42.270 --> 00:29:44.300
Let's look a little bit,
let's look a little bit

00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:45.260
at Game of Death.

00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:49.120
Game of Death is a team
that started out really low.

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:51.030
So, let's see here,
Game of Death.

00:29:51.030 --> 00:29:53.710
So, we can click on them
here under Battlecode Teams.

00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:56.020
We see that they were
13 and 3, their ranking

00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:58.860
was at the bottom of
the scrimmage ranks.

00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:01.800
So, let's have a look at how
they made it up to round four

00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:04.500
from the very bottom round.

00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:07.934
They had a bad seed
at the beginning

00:30:07.934 --> 00:30:09.600
and they made it all
the way up to here.

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:11.370
How were they able to do that?

00:30:11.370 --> 00:30:14.192
Because they must be
doing something right.

00:30:14.192 --> 00:30:15.150
What's this turnaround?

00:30:15.150 --> 00:30:16.820
Let's, have a look at this.

00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:18.855
So, I'm going to go
over here and I'm

00:30:18.855 --> 00:30:20.030
going to run that match.

00:30:20.030 --> 00:30:24.540
And I'm pretty sure we'll
have time to talk about all

00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:27.210
of the interesting things
that happen in this one

00:30:27.210 --> 00:30:29.440
and in the next ones.

00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:33.040
So, here on the right,
we have that team,

00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:36.580
that new team
which is upsetting,

00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:38.174
one after another, other team.

00:30:38.174 --> 00:30:39.590
And he's going to
build suppliers,

00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:42.230
so he's built two suppliers,
and he's building a few mines

00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:43.400
around the headquarters.

00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:45.230
And it looks like
he's just rolling

00:30:45.230 --> 00:30:48.927
over team 172 which
was Drunkasaurus.

00:30:48.927 --> 00:30:51.010
Drunkasaurus is another
one of these rush players,

00:30:51.010 --> 00:30:53.640
and you'd expect rush to be
pretty effective on this map.

00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:54.750
So what happened?

00:30:54.750 --> 00:30:58.620
I think it's worth mentioning
that a rush player would

00:30:58.620 --> 00:31:00.390
do well.

00:31:00.390 --> 00:31:04.360
If this rush player is not
really pathing around mines,

00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:05.830
if that's not the
way that they're

00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:08.540
planning to play the
game, then they probably

00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:10.230
ought to get defusion.

00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:13.820
I mean they've spent a
few rounds buying fusion,

00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:15.279
doesn't make that
much sense to me.

00:31:15.279 --> 00:31:17.570
I think you might get one
free around at the beginning.

00:31:17.570 --> 00:31:19.195
It seems like a lot
of people will just

00:31:19.195 --> 00:31:20.980
put one point into something.

00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:22.580
But the amount of
time it takes him

00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:25.821
to get the enemy he can compute
because he just went straight

00:31:25.821 --> 00:31:26.320
there.

00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:28.530
So, he can compute that time
and he can say, alright,

00:31:28.530 --> 00:31:30.762
was that worth it.

00:31:30.762 --> 00:31:32.470
It's also worth
mentioning that, I think,

00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:33.928
in a lot of these
engagements, he's

00:31:33.928 --> 00:31:36.050
busy defusing mines
during combat.

00:31:36.050 --> 00:31:37.800
And like we said
before, you can't

00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:40.090
attack while you're
defusing a mine.

00:31:40.090 --> 00:31:44.350
So, part of the best
reason of getting defusion

00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:47.970
is so that you only have
five rounds of inaction.

00:31:47.970 --> 00:31:50.315
So that, let's say,
nobody's around.

00:31:50.315 --> 00:31:52.870
It's perfectly safe, great
time to defuse a mine.

00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:54.490
So, you start
defusing that mine.

00:31:54.490 --> 00:31:55.450
Now, you see the enemy.

00:31:55.450 --> 00:31:58.300
You can't cancel the
defusion process.

00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:01.210
So, if you were going to
do a 12-turn diffusion

00:32:01.210 --> 00:32:03.700
and you see the enemy and
he's at a distance of,

00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:05.150
wait, what's the distance?

00:32:05.150 --> 00:32:06.710
All we have to do is look it up.

00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:09.420
So, let's go to my
Useful Specs document,

00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:11.720
which is neither
handy nor dandy.

00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:14.350
It's, in fact, much more
serious and much more useful

00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:16.460
than both of those
terms would suggest.

00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:18.470
So, range 14 is
your sight range.

00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:20.539
You can see a unit
that's three tiles away.

00:32:20.539 --> 00:32:22.080
I can zoom in a
little bit more here.

00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:23.830
It's rastered, so it
looks kind of silly.

00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:25.850
I always think it's interesting
how when you raster something,

00:32:25.850 --> 00:32:27.270
sometimes it becomes
orange on one side

00:32:27.270 --> 00:32:28.390
and blue on the other side.

00:32:28.390 --> 00:32:30.070
I'm sure some of you in
this room understand it.

00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:31.819
And I'm sure that some
of you in this room

00:32:31.819 --> 00:32:33.890
don't care to understand
it and never want to.

00:32:33.890 --> 00:32:35.756
So, he's three units
away, right, the enemy

00:32:35.756 --> 00:32:37.130
is three units
away, and you just

00:32:37.130 --> 00:32:39.030
started defusing
the round before.

00:32:39.030 --> 00:32:42.150
So if that's a
12-round defusion,

00:32:42.150 --> 00:32:44.350
then by the time he
gets to you, you've

00:32:44.350 --> 00:32:48.020
still got seven or nine rounds
left, if you subtract correctly

00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:50.569
and depending on the turn
counts, and whatever.

00:32:50.569 --> 00:32:52.110
That's a lot of time
that you're just

00:32:52.110 --> 00:32:52.820
going to spend doing nothing.

00:32:52.820 --> 00:32:54.986
And how long does it take
for the enemy to kill you?

00:32:54.986 --> 00:32:57.810
They deal six damage per
round, you have 40 hit points.

00:32:57.810 --> 00:33:01.650
I can't divide, but that sounds
like seven-ish, seven rounds.

00:33:01.650 --> 00:33:04.470
Well, look at that, so you had
12, you didn't see anybody,

00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:07.270
they had time to approach
and kill you and go away

00:33:07.270 --> 00:33:08.230
before you finished.

00:33:08.230 --> 00:33:09.710
That's really lousy.

00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:11.211
Even if they get
one hit off on you,

00:33:11.211 --> 00:33:12.793
that's going to make
a huge difference

00:33:12.793 --> 00:33:14.360
because this is a
knife edge game.

00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:17.570
It's a game of instabilities
because we don't start you off

00:33:17.570 --> 00:33:20.284
with a command center that
deals damage, for example.

00:33:20.284 --> 00:33:22.325
We don't give you that
many defensive advantages.

00:33:22.325 --> 00:33:24.965
So, as soon as the enemy gets
a couple more units in you,

00:33:24.965 --> 00:33:27.090
it's just going to start
pushing in that direction,

00:33:27.090 --> 00:33:29.330
unless they start
making mistakes.

00:33:29.330 --> 00:33:30.830
So, that's one of
the reasons why

00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:34.680
defusing a mine without
defusion and without vision

00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:35.560
is a problem.

00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:37.480
Let's say you have both
vision and defusion.

00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:39.860
I mean, of course, they're
very expensive upgrades,

00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:41.460
but let's say you've got them.

00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:43.430
Well now, it's only
going to take five rounds

00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:46.030
to defuse something
and you have can

00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:49.560
see a unit that's
five tiles away.

00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:51.610
So, let's say he's over
here, you don't see him,

00:33:51.610 --> 00:33:52.610
you start defusing.

00:33:52.610 --> 00:33:55.050
Now, he's starting to show up
and he's moving toward you.

00:33:55.050 --> 00:33:56.720
By the time he gets there,
you're done defusing

00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:57.900
and you can start shooting.

00:33:57.900 --> 00:33:59.282
That's a pretty big difference.

00:33:59.282 --> 00:34:00.990
And I think that's
one of the reasons why

00:34:00.990 --> 00:34:03.010
we see a lot of
successful rush teams

00:34:03.010 --> 00:34:04.900
go ahead and get that defusion.

00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:07.600
Whereas, we see Drunkasaurus
here not getting defusion.

00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:09.730
We see decent micro
on both teams' side.

00:34:09.730 --> 00:34:13.080
I don't know exactly if this is
good micro coming out of both,

00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:16.750
there's certainly a
lot of motion going on.

00:34:16.750 --> 00:34:18.699
It's anybody's guess.

00:34:18.699 --> 00:34:20.739
Here both teams
are defusing mines.

00:34:20.739 --> 00:34:22.630
They're just
watching each other,

00:34:22.630 --> 00:34:28.199
maybe they're playing Parcheesi
with the mine defusion,

00:34:28.199 --> 00:34:30.790
exchanging tips on how
not to get blown up.

00:34:30.790 --> 00:34:31.900
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:34.409
PROFESSOR: I think it's
a very odd thing to see,

00:34:34.409 --> 00:34:36.150
I think it's quite strange.

00:34:36.150 --> 00:34:38.760
But yeah, the point
has been made,

00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:41.850
the point has been
abundantly made.

00:34:41.850 --> 00:34:43.513
Another thing, if
you're retreating

00:34:43.513 --> 00:34:44.929
and you are adjacent
to the enemy,

00:34:44.929 --> 00:34:46.428
I think we've seen
this a lot, and I

00:34:46.428 --> 00:34:49.080
think that is what's going
on in some of these cases,

00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:51.113
maybe this guy is
adjacent to the enemy

00:34:51.113 --> 00:34:53.540
and maybe he's retreating
because he's got one energon.

00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:55.719
He's like, get me
the hell out of here.

00:34:55.719 --> 00:34:58.610
I think he's maybe or was
trying to retreat at some point,

00:34:58.610 --> 00:35:01.820
but it's a bad idea
to defuse a mind when

00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:03.180
you're adjacent to the enemy.

00:35:03.180 --> 00:35:05.440
Don't start, just don't start.

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:08.400
It's like smoking,
just don't start.

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:10.480
Yes, this advertisement
brought to you

00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:12.560
by the American
Society for lungs.

00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:14.750
I don't know, I just
thought that sounded right.

00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:19.300
So yeah, here once again we see
this is the same two players.

00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:23.250
But in this case, the blue
team just, I don't know,

00:35:23.250 --> 00:35:25.500
he's dancing, or something.

00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:26.810
It's not super effective.

00:35:26.810 --> 00:35:28.300
He's building nukes.

00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:31.347
Somehow he's decided, yeah,
now's the time to get nukes.

00:35:31.347 --> 00:35:32.180
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:34.890
PROFESSOR: I've gotten
Pickaxe, but I'm not using it.

00:35:34.890 --> 00:35:39.200
So, I think, but no, to be fair,
I think, what he's trying to do

00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:41.800
is lay a bunch of
mines into a minefield.

00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:43.404
And he's doing that
using his Pickaxe.

00:35:43.404 --> 00:35:44.820
But, I think, maybe
he's thinking,

00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:46.070
alright, there's a
lot of neutral mines,

00:35:46.070 --> 00:35:48.590
these are supposed to help me
out, I shouldn't destroy them.

00:35:48.590 --> 00:35:53.690
But nevertheless, the red team
is able to just roll this over,

00:35:53.690 --> 00:35:55.950
so it does go on to a
third a third match.

00:35:55.950 --> 00:35:57.230
But what a difference.

00:35:57.230 --> 00:35:59.370
What a difference we see here.

00:35:59.370 --> 00:36:01.120
He's getting close
to his maximum.

00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:03.400
But we see he's
optimized for this.

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:04.150
Look at his units.

00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:06.660
He's using 500 bytecodes,
that's effectively zero.

00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:09.490
So, he's going to be able to
get up to the full 40 units.

00:36:09.490 --> 00:36:13.350
And that strength
of that 40 units,

00:36:13.350 --> 00:36:15.600
what is the strength
point of that 40 units?

00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:20.120
Well, let's simply go back
here to here, to here.

00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:23.300
That 400 round counter?

00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:26.304
That's exactly when
you hit your maximum

00:36:26.304 --> 00:36:27.720
if you haven't
built any upgrades.

00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:30.210
And that's exactly when he
arrives at the enemy base.

00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:34.130
So, unless we start changing
the maps, not getting upgrades

00:36:34.130 --> 00:36:35.410
is going to be fine for you.

00:36:35.410 --> 00:36:38.000
As long as you're
not doing what he

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:42.002
did in the last round,
which was somehow bad.

00:36:42.002 --> 00:36:43.960
I mean, you've got to
have that clump of units.

00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:46.190
And, I think, one thing
that we see again and again,

00:36:46.190 --> 00:36:48.864
is once a team loses
its clump of units

00:36:48.864 --> 00:36:50.030
it sends them in one by one.

00:36:50.030 --> 00:36:52.870
Now, it's not obvious
but that's a bad idea.

00:36:52.870 --> 00:36:54.700
Because we've seen
teams win that way.

00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:55.510
So, what do you do?

00:36:55.510 --> 00:36:58.740
OK, now that was pretty
one-sided, what happened there?

00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:01.550
Did blue have more units
or did red have more units.

00:37:01.550 --> 00:37:04.370
OK, let's go and say
this is three by five.

00:37:04.370 --> 00:37:06.730
So that's 15 units because
these three go into it,

00:37:06.730 --> 00:37:07.600
and that's 18.

00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:08.700
So, that's 18 units.

00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:10.540
This is three by five
with three missing,

00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:14.040
so that's 15 units plus,
OK, that's 18,19, 20.

00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:15.250
So, this guy's got 20.

00:37:15.250 --> 00:37:18.757
I guess that accounts for these
guys that blue left behind.

00:37:18.757 --> 00:37:20.090
So red's got a slight advantage.

00:37:20.090 --> 00:37:23.932
All teams are defusing mines,
these two could be fighting.

00:37:23.932 --> 00:37:25.890
There is no reason for
them not to be fighting.

00:37:25.890 --> 00:37:29.180
Now, red has managed to kill
this guy off very handily,

00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:30.910
because of that advantage.

00:37:30.910 --> 00:37:32.760
We saw before, in
Corey's lecture,

00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:34.440
how he's talking
about this being

00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:36.720
a very unstable situation,
where if you've got

00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:38.200
one gap between the two.

00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:40.880
The person who closes
that gap first will win.

00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:43.170
So, let's see if somebody's
going to close that gap.

00:37:43.170 --> 00:37:46.120
Well, now look at how
much damage blue is doing?

00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:47.810
That's pretty
impressive and, I think,

00:37:47.810 --> 00:37:50.389
part of that is we're seeing
that a lot of red's units

00:37:50.389 --> 00:37:52.680
are just spending time
defusing, this one and this one,

00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:55.890
in particular, also this one,
which is right in the middle.

00:37:55.890 --> 00:37:59.780
These three in the back,
definitely not ones to ignore.

00:37:59.780 --> 00:38:01.910
So yeah, blue ends
up coming in here

00:38:01.910 --> 00:38:03.670
and capitalizes on
a little advantage.

00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:08.070
Now, red, OK, red
is still attacking.

00:38:08.070 --> 00:38:09.506
There's a point in this battle.

00:38:09.506 --> 00:38:11.130
One of things about
battles is that you

00:38:11.130 --> 00:38:12.680
know where the enemy is.

00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:14.420
Right, so you can
make that count.

00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:15.650
You can count them,
you can say, alright,

00:38:15.650 --> 00:38:16.960
we're about to lose this battle.

00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:18.450
Here's an interesting
question for you.

00:38:18.450 --> 00:38:20.075
You're losing a
battle, what do you do?

00:38:20.075 --> 00:38:21.970
Do you call for
reinforcements and say, OK,

00:38:21.970 --> 00:38:25.040
if we have more reinforcements,
we won't lose as badly?

00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:26.640
Or, do you say to
the reinforcements,

00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:28.265
please go back to
the base and regroup,

00:38:28.265 --> 00:38:31.640
it's your only chance to live?

00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:35.450
I mean, I don't think we have,
I'm hitting the b button,

00:38:35.450 --> 00:38:37.890
there's no broadcast
going on in the whole map.

00:38:37.890 --> 00:38:39.432
But you could imagine
the case where

00:38:39.432 --> 00:38:40.890
they would be like,
OK, I'm telling

00:38:40.890 --> 00:38:43.260
my allies get the
hell out of there.

00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:47.030
And this guy, so, he sees
a very bad situation,

00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:50.550
and here he's two tiles
away from an enemy.

00:38:50.550 --> 00:38:51.660
He's got the choice.

00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:52.580
Do I move?

00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:53.705
Close that gap?

00:38:53.705 --> 00:38:55.080
I mean, that's a
bad idea, right?

00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:57.329
From Corey's lecture, you
don't close a gap of two,

00:38:57.329 --> 00:38:59.370
because then you won't
have the attack advantage.

00:38:59.370 --> 00:39:01.020
That's not a good idea.

00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:02.250
But what's he going to do?

00:39:02.250 --> 00:39:03.572
So, let's click on it.

00:39:03.572 --> 00:39:04.280
Oh, look at that.

00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:04.847
He moved in.

00:39:04.847 --> 00:39:06.180
And what's he going to do again?

00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:08.070
Oh, he's kiting a
little bit well,

00:39:08.070 --> 00:39:09.590
he's only fighting
one of the enemy.

00:39:09.590 --> 00:39:11.800
That's not so bad, but he
ends up being destroyed.

00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:13.142
I mean, what can he expect.

00:39:13.142 --> 00:39:14.600
I think it would
be very reasonable

00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:16.170
for you to write
code that says, OK,

00:39:16.170 --> 00:39:18.044
if the enemy is there,
what am I going to do.

00:39:18.044 --> 00:39:19.890
A lot of times we've
seen teams back away.

00:39:19.890 --> 00:39:21.290
They try to do a retreat.

00:39:21.290 --> 00:39:23.240
Of course, a retreat doesn't
work if you're already engaged.

00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:24.448
Let's say you're not engaged.

00:39:24.448 --> 00:39:27.230
OK, we're smart people, we don't
retreat when we're engaged,

00:39:27.230 --> 00:39:28.560
that would be a bad idea.

00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:29.440
We keep with it.

00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:30.560
We have our commitment.

00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:32.185
But we back out.

00:39:32.185 --> 00:39:33.060
Where do we back out?

00:39:33.060 --> 00:39:35.304
We've seen teams, time and
again, try to back away

00:39:35.304 --> 00:39:37.720
and then they get stuck, because
there's mines in the way.

00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:40.480
They only cleared a very narrow
path through to the enemy.

00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:42.200
So, why not remember
the path that you

00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:44.810
took to get to that enemy,
so that you can then, just

00:39:44.810 --> 00:39:46.110
follow that backwards?

00:39:46.110 --> 00:39:49.010
You have omnidirectional
view, so that might work.

00:39:49.010 --> 00:39:50.800
It might not, it might
be a terrible idea.

00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:52.250
But I'm just putting
it out there.

00:39:52.250 --> 00:39:55.370
Because you can save map
locations pretty easily,

00:39:55.370 --> 00:39:56.410
to an array.

00:39:56.410 --> 00:39:58.740
And then, it's, OK, just
pop that array back.

00:39:58.740 --> 00:40:00.610
So, you're pushing
to an array and then

00:40:00.610 --> 00:40:02.500
you're popping the
array values back,

00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:05.070
so it's its own ordered
list of where I've been,

00:40:05.070 --> 00:40:06.900
and where I want to
go back to, and what

00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:08.090
I want to do with my
life, and whether I

00:40:08.090 --> 00:40:09.880
want to visit Paris
and eat baguettes.

00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:13.860
So it's a full integrated
system for traveling the world.

00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:15.290
And, I think, red
could definitely

00:40:15.290 --> 00:40:17.450
benefit from that, especially
in a case like this.

00:40:17.450 --> 00:40:19.449
I mean, would he be able
to come back from this?

00:40:19.449 --> 00:40:20.180
Probably no.

00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:22.680
I mean, just a little bit
of macro from blue, I think,

00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:24.750
ends up making a
huge difference.

00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:27.320
But nevertheless,
it's worth mentioning.

00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:29.860
So, why does red
not win this map?

00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:31.866
We've seen rush teams do well.

00:40:31.866 --> 00:40:33.490
I think it's just
because blue actually

00:40:33.490 --> 00:40:34.900
built any units at all.

00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:36.870
But there you have it.

00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:37.570
Good game.

00:40:37.570 --> 00:40:38.840
That's a good game.

00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:41.450
Let's make sure that we're
getting to everything.

00:40:41.450 --> 00:40:44.630
So, we've seen some games
where we had a run around.

00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:47.390
Where one team would
run around, would

00:40:47.390 --> 00:40:49.557
circumvent the other
team, and deal damage

00:40:49.557 --> 00:40:50.390
to the headquarters.

00:40:50.390 --> 00:40:53.112
As we've said before, the
win condition is as follows.

00:40:53.112 --> 00:40:55.320
I don't think we've been
that straightforward on what

00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:56.879
the win conditions are.

00:40:56.879 --> 00:40:58.920
First and foremost, it's
a headquarter hit point.

00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:01.170
So if you can get one
hit off the enemy,

00:41:01.170 --> 00:41:03.170
that's a good time
to just back out.

00:41:03.170 --> 00:41:06.780
Maybe, the time now is
to just lay some mines

00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:07.780
and play defensively.

00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:12.540
As long as you have registered
a hit on the enemy headquarters.

00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:15.660
Let's say, if your soldier
moves to the enemy headquarters

00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:18.840
and is adjacent, that's a nice
time for him to broadcast,

00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:22.050
hey, I was adjacent to the
enemy headquarters, ergo,

00:41:22.050 --> 00:41:23.260
I did damage to him.

00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:24.420
That's a given.

00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:25.730
That's always true.

00:41:25.730 --> 00:41:30.380
Unless the enemy has a med bay
adjacent to his headquarters,

00:41:30.380 --> 00:41:33.266
dealing damage-- No,
that's not going to work?

00:41:33.266 --> 00:41:34.700
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:36.790
PROFESSOR: Well,
there you go folks,

00:41:36.790 --> 00:41:40.980
you've heard it from the words
of somebody knowledgeable.

00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:43.004
So yeah, so there you
go, so you would know,

00:41:43.004 --> 00:41:45.170
so you could message and
you could play defensively.

00:41:45.170 --> 00:41:47.150
Headquarter hit points
first and foremost,

00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:49.350
number of encampments,
second, number of mines,

00:41:49.350 --> 00:41:53.060
third, number of
robots, third, fourth.

00:41:53.060 --> 00:41:55.067
Good one.

00:41:55.067 --> 00:41:56.400
Yeah, so we saw some runarounds.

00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:58.990
We saw some teams
running around the enemy.

00:41:58.990 --> 00:42:02.710
And we've also seen,
especially at the lower

00:42:02.710 --> 00:42:06.220
levels of the bracket, if your
headquarters is under attack,

00:42:06.220 --> 00:42:09.860
it is of paramount
importance, tantamount

00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:13.470
to paramount importance, that
you come back and defend it.

00:42:13.470 --> 00:42:15.520
Definitely worth
sending a signal.

00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:20.100
Allied soldiers, either
protect me or just declare

00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:22.119
yourselves null and
void and you're not

00:42:22.119 --> 00:42:23.410
going to get a Christmas bonus.

00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:31.030
So, like I said before, Game
of Death was a great team.

00:42:31.030 --> 00:42:32.970
We saw them get really far.

00:42:32.970 --> 00:42:35.080
Velociraptors,
Drunkasaurus, and Cortege,

00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:37.140
we saw them rush and be
very effective with that.

00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:39.570
There are ways of making
a rush more effective,

00:42:39.570 --> 00:42:40.910
we saw them do those things.

00:42:40.910 --> 00:42:42.970
I think it was very impressive.

00:42:42.970 --> 00:42:45.530
We saw Soda, which was
a really good team.

00:42:45.530 --> 00:42:48.690
They did well in the
newbie tournament last year

00:42:48.690 --> 00:42:51.289
and I'm excited to see
them back again this year.

00:42:51.289 --> 00:42:52.830
There were certain
things they didn't

00:42:52.830 --> 00:42:56.170
do that we're kind of
strange and a lot of teams

00:42:56.170 --> 00:42:59.080
here probably felt that
they could have done better.

00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:01.650
These little edge cases
end up being so important.

00:43:01.650 --> 00:43:03.770
On Little Forts, they're
standing right next

00:43:03.770 --> 00:43:05.550
to the enemy, this
was so sad, they're

00:43:05.550 --> 00:43:07.550
standing right next to
the enemy while the enemy

00:43:07.550 --> 00:43:08.367
researchers nuke.

00:43:08.367 --> 00:43:10.700
And they're surrounding them,
they've got tons of units,

00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:11.908
but they just didn't move in.

00:43:11.908 --> 00:43:14.290
I mean, there's this certain
state machine code, maybe

00:43:14.290 --> 00:43:17.020
a couple of mines, maybe
they had indigestion.

00:43:17.020 --> 00:43:20.510
There's clearly a good reason,
but they just didn't do it.

00:43:20.510 --> 00:43:25.880
And checking for those edge
cases is just so hard to do.

00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:27.880
I think is all going to
be so cleared up though.

00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:29.660
We're going to see
some great stuff.

00:43:29.660 --> 00:43:34.270
Hey, I Just Met You, again,
we saw their bipolar response

00:43:34.270 --> 00:43:34.870
to maps.

00:43:34.870 --> 00:43:36.890
I thought that was
just fantastic,

00:43:36.890 --> 00:43:39.310
absolutely fantastic.

00:43:39.310 --> 00:43:42.860
I want to finish by
talking a little bit

00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:46.810
about the way the game
might change in the future.

00:43:46.810 --> 00:43:51.370
So, you saw certain specs
and you saw certain maps.

00:43:51.370 --> 00:43:53.745
This is the kind of thing that
we change after the Sprint

00:43:53.745 --> 00:43:55.286
Tournament or the
Seeding Tournament,

00:43:55.286 --> 00:43:57.250
where we go, OK, we want
to tweak this a little

00:43:57.250 --> 00:43:59.150
to make sure the
game is interesting.

00:43:59.150 --> 00:44:00.880
That's our big focus.

00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:02.580
We want the game
to be interesting.

00:44:02.580 --> 00:44:03.830
We don't want it to be random.

00:44:03.830 --> 00:44:06.760
We want to showcase how
amazing you guys are.

00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:09.990
So if it ends up being the
case that rushes are the best

00:44:09.990 --> 00:44:11.830
and that a little
bit of microcode

00:44:11.830 --> 00:44:13.750
makes a difference
between winning and losing

00:44:13.750 --> 00:44:16.870
100% of the time, I don't
think that that's great.

00:44:16.870 --> 00:44:17.660
I don't like that.

00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:20.970
So, let's say that
there could be changes.

00:44:20.970 --> 00:44:23.050
Now, when you hear
that, you probably go,

00:44:23.050 --> 00:44:25.080
aha, he's going to tell
me the changes that

00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:26.505
are going to
happen, but he's not

00:44:26.505 --> 00:44:28.130
allowed to tell me
the changes, so he's

00:44:28.130 --> 00:44:29.280
going to tell them
hypothetically,

00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:30.490
but they will actually happen.

00:44:30.490 --> 00:44:32.864
But no, that's not the case,
I'm just coming up with them

00:44:32.864 --> 00:44:34.810
hypothetically, I guarantee it.

00:44:34.810 --> 00:44:37.210
OK, so the changes are,
OK, we've got a nuke.

00:44:37.210 --> 00:44:39.850
The nuke is 400 rounds.

00:44:39.850 --> 00:44:44.900
OK, we have the
maximum soldier count

00:44:44.900 --> 00:44:47.370
for a rush is at 400 rounds.

00:44:47.370 --> 00:44:49.517
We've seen that using my
Mathematica simulator,

00:44:49.517 --> 00:44:51.350
we've seen it with
soldiers, I'm sure you've

00:44:51.350 --> 00:44:52.870
written it yourself.

00:44:52.870 --> 00:44:55.190
I mean, it's
technically 200 rounds

00:44:55.190 --> 00:45:00.940
if you're computing
digits of pi.

00:45:00.940 --> 00:45:03.440
Yeah, because, as
we've said before, that

00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:06.160
would mean that you have
a whole lot less tabs.

00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:09.040
So, that's 400 rounds.

00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:15.780
The minimum distance
between headquarters is 10.

00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:18.780
The maximum distance
between headquarters

00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:24.850
is, I think we said it was
200 rounds of walking mining.

00:45:24.850 --> 00:45:26.460
I think that's what
we said it was.

00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:29.510
So, in the current
set, you're not

00:45:29.510 --> 00:45:33.250
going to get a map
that's 400 on the side.

00:45:33.250 --> 00:45:35.010
I think the maximum
we said is 70.

00:45:35.010 --> 00:45:38.330
So, if it were 70 on
a side, then there

00:45:38.330 --> 00:45:40.370
would be exactly 70
mines between you

00:45:40.370 --> 00:45:44.060
and the enemy times 5
rounds per mine is 350.

00:45:44.060 --> 00:45:46.460
So that's absolute
worst, worst, worst,

00:45:46.460 --> 00:45:49.410
that it could possibly be and
that would look like this.

00:45:49.410 --> 00:45:52.010
That would be all
grey, full of mines.

00:45:52.010 --> 00:45:53.510
And that's just not
going to happen.

00:45:53.510 --> 00:45:57.140
Realistically, we're going
to put in some silly path,

00:45:57.140 --> 00:45:59.700
and you can just walk there.

00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:01.710
So, with the current
spec, the point

00:46:01.710 --> 00:46:05.499
that I'm trying to make-- I
mean, OK, you could add 25

00:46:05.499 --> 00:46:07.290
because it'll take you
a little bit of time

00:46:07.290 --> 00:46:09.150
to research defusion,
so you can get

00:46:09.150 --> 00:46:12.470
to the other side-- but my
point is that this is only 350.

00:46:12.470 --> 00:46:15.950
And so, you're really only going
to have 200 rounds of walking.

00:46:15.950 --> 00:46:19.480
And the fact is we don't want to
get that close to that number,

00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:22.600
so we end up 99% of
the time, right now

00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:24.413
we're making it 100
rounds of walking.

00:46:24.413 --> 00:46:25.871
AUDIENCE: That
would be six, right?

00:46:25.871 --> 00:46:28.204
Because you're moving for
five rounds and then you move,

00:46:28.204 --> 00:46:29.690
right?

00:46:29.690 --> 00:46:32.680
PROFESSOR: OK, sure so it's six.

00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:33.180
Very good.

00:46:33.180 --> 00:46:40.010
So that's a six and that's
a 420 + 25 = ugly, no,

00:46:40.010 --> 00:46:42.350
it's a-- I don't
know, it's ugly.

00:46:42.350 --> 00:46:43.467
You made my diagram ugly.

00:46:43.467 --> 00:46:44.050
You know what?

00:46:44.050 --> 00:46:45.860
I'd rather be correct
than beautiful.

00:46:45.860 --> 00:46:48.240
I mean, oh, I can't have both?

00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:49.310
OK, so anyway.

00:46:49.310 --> 00:46:51.376
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:46:51.376 --> 00:46:53.940
PROFESSOR: My poor diagram.

00:46:53.940 --> 00:46:55.654
I knew you well.

00:46:55.654 --> 00:46:56.570
Yeah so, there you go.

00:46:56.570 --> 00:46:58.740
See, just looking at
these numbers here

00:46:58.740 --> 00:47:01.060
you can add them
up and you get 730

00:47:01.060 --> 00:47:02.390
and it doesn't mean anything.

00:47:02.390 --> 00:47:03.950
No, I'm kidding.

00:47:03.950 --> 00:47:05.660
You can see these
numbers, they just

00:47:05.660 --> 00:47:07.316
don't make sense
for econ strategies.

00:47:07.316 --> 00:47:08.440
They just don't make sense.

00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:10.550
So, what we might
do, and what I've

00:47:10.550 --> 00:47:14.690
been telling the others I would
like to do, is set nuke to 600,

00:47:14.690 --> 00:47:16.230
let's say nuke were 600.

00:47:16.230 --> 00:47:18.235
This can stay at-- it
doesn't matter what things

00:47:18.235 --> 00:47:19.610
are in absolute
terms, it matters

00:47:19.610 --> 00:47:21.640
what they are compared
to other terms--

00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:23.780
so the soldier rush,
OK, let's keep that 400.

00:47:23.780 --> 00:47:28.460
The nuke is 600, let's make
the maximum distance 300.

00:47:28.460 --> 00:47:30.660
So now, these are
changing at the same rate,

00:47:30.660 --> 00:47:33.400
the nuke and the distance are
changing at the same rate.

00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:35.270
So nukes will be
no more favored.

00:47:35.270 --> 00:47:41.190
What will be favored is now it's
farther to get to the enemy.

00:47:41.190 --> 00:47:43.450
And you still have the
same number of, maybe

00:47:43.450 --> 00:47:45.057
a smaller number of
soldiers relative

00:47:45.057 --> 00:47:46.140
to what the other guy has.

00:47:46.140 --> 00:47:47.630
So, this would favor econ.

00:47:47.630 --> 00:47:49.990
If we increase nuke
and the distance then

00:47:49.990 --> 00:47:51.570
that will favor econ strategy.

00:47:51.570 --> 00:47:54.879
And so, then I think
we'll start to see

00:47:54.879 --> 00:47:57.170
some more interesting games
where there's just a couple

00:47:57.170 --> 00:47:58.570
more encampments being taken.

00:47:58.570 --> 00:48:02.130
And this competition is
moving in wonderful directions

00:48:02.130 --> 00:48:06.160
and it's moving that way
under the fiery engines

00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:07.920
of your spirit.

00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:10.200
Thank you for attending
the last lecture

00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:12.530
and I'll be around here
for questions afterward.

00:48:17.630 --> 00:48:19.180
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]
