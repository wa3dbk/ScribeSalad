00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.610
PROFESSOR: All right, so that's
a good start to Battlecode

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.490
Lecture 2.

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:29.700
Welcome.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.200
Today, we'll be talking about
how to write your first player

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.660
and then at 6:00 PM we're going
to be having some Indian food.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:36.790
I'm pretty excited.

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.631
And it looks like there will
be enough Indian food for all

00:00:39.631 --> 00:00:40.130
of you.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.730
I correctly estimated how many
of you would show up today.

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.120
Isn't that a curious
aspect of statistics,

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.380
that you cannot tell what one
person is going to do tomorrow,

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.330
but you can tell, very
accurately, what everyone,

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.500
in aggregate, is
going to do tomorrow?

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.680
Quite interesting.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:02.600
I believe in 2006, the number
of automobile accident deaths

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.790
was correctly estimated
to the last man,

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.980
or something absolutely
crazy like that.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.250
Because it's a number like
40,000 and it was unbelievable.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:21.480
So with that heartwarming opener
about automobile homicide,

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:27.410
I'm going to play
some slightly less--

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.880
some slightly more
calming images.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.240
So you'll see here
on the screen is

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.300
the evolution of a
very simple rule.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.850
This rule is
something like sum up

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.800
the number of nearest neighbors
and if that number is even then

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.440
the square will be
white in the next turn,

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.880
and if the number is odd then
the square will be black.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.570
It's something like
that, in essence.

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.560
And it ends up making this
repeating pattern that

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.470
is quite mesmerizing to see
and is an excellent example

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.650
of emergent complexity.

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:04.530
So, what we'll be
doing today is we're

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.050
going to write code
that's pretty darn simple.

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.010
A rule like mod two =
zero, something like that.

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.290
And what we're going to
get is some really awesome

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.260
looking behavior that comes
out of that very simple rule.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.610
So there you go, that's
my tie-in for that.

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.800
Administration
stuff, so here I've

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.960
brought up the
Battlecode website.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.660
You should all be set up with
Eclipse right now, already.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.705
If you haven't then
you're falling behind,

00:02:33.705 --> 00:02:35.330
but then again, at
the same time you've

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.205
saved yourself some
effort because we've just

00:02:37.205 --> 00:02:38.840
put out another release.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.440
So, what you want to do
is download the installer

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.370
and install it to
the same directory

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.146
where you currently
have Battlecode.

00:02:46.146 --> 00:02:47.520
And that should
update everything

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.228
without deleting the
progress that you've

00:02:49.228 --> 00:02:50.070
made on your player.

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:53.792
So there's that.

00:02:53.792 --> 00:02:57.090
There's also some
exciting things

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.280
I'm supposed to be announcing.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:06.420
That we'll be giving away prizes
for things other than winning.

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.290
So, if you're going
to see my amazing code

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.056
and you're going to
go, man, I didn't

00:03:11.056 --> 00:03:12.180
think I could do that well.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.080
Although, I find
it much more likely

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.230
that you could watch what I'm
going to do and then go, pfft,

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.300
I could have done
that in my sleep,

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.630
I can't believe this guy.

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.640
But yeah, we'll be
giving away prizes

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.870
for doing things other
than winning this year.

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.494
And those things I'll be
announcing throughout the year

00:03:28.494 --> 00:03:30.910
so you can keep them in the
back of your mind and be like,

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:36.450
oh I have code that does that I
should think about doing this.

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.790
There will be beating
the reference player

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.030
with the fewest total bytecodes,
beating the reference player

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.470
in the shortest possible time.

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.678
By the way, we haven't
released the reference player.

00:03:46.678 --> 00:03:51.740
We will be releasing one within
the next couple of weeks.

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:53.580
And, I don't know
if I've said it yet,

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.830
but to get credit
for the course you

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.770
have to beat the reference
player that we'll

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.150
provide on a map
set that we provide.

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.750
So it'll be called
reference player

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.680
and there will be more
information about that later.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.110
You're also able to get credit
by writing a short report

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:13.534
on how your code
works if you weren't

00:04:13.534 --> 00:04:14.950
able to beat the
reference player.

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.329
So don't fret too much.

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:19.640
So, those two ways are
ways of winning money.

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.000
You can also have the most
interesting use of our source

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.210
code, like if you want to
make it so that Nyan Cats are

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.200
part of Battlecode, or
some other silly thing,

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.180
that might get you something.

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.440
And there's also most
impressive non-winning strategy,

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.990
which may very well be the
thing that we see today.

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.310
All right, so here I'm
going to go to Eclipse,

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.880
this is our supported
development environment,

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.660
and I'm going to start
setting up a new player.

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.180
So, I've got all these extra
Battlecode installs because

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.470
of the development
nonsense that went on.

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.670
So what I'm going to do
is I'm going to just start

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:00.220
from scratch and I'm
going to make sure

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:04.840
that I talk about the functions
that I'm using in ways that

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.900
are useful to both beginners
and intermediate people.

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.310
So, beginners have to
like hurry to catch up

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.900
and intermediate people are more
hearing about the Battlecode

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:19.220
API and hearing about how things
are put together, specifically,

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.070
about Battlecode that
they wouldn't already

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.940
know from their job
experience, for example.

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.310
So, let's start this way.

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:28.070
I'm going to make
a new team that I

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:31.290
can fight against my
other teams that are here.

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:33.310
Because I want to
keep trying this.

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:35.760
A big thing about
programming is making

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.070
it iteritable-- Iterable?

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.670
Iterable.

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:43.680
Interval implements runnable,
anyway these kinds of things.

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.214
And so, you'll want to have
a bunch of different robots

00:05:46.214 --> 00:05:47.630
that can play
against one another.

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:48.910
And so, you can be
like, all right,

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:50.860
I'm going to right-click
this team's folder

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:52.880
and I'm going to go
to Create Package

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.450
and I'm going to
call it-- What's

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:57.540
a good name for this awesome
robot that we're going to make?

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:59.200
Yeah, Awesome Robot.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:05:59.700
OK.

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:03.510
Play Awesome Robot player, all
right, I guess that's decent.

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:04.510
Yeah.

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:08.050
And then, in this
one, I go New File,

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:10.785
and I call it robotplayer.java.

00:06:10.785 --> 00:06:13.410
It has to be called that because
that's the thing that our game

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:15.270
engine is looking for.

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.080
So then, at the very
top, we're going

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:27.150
to write down package
Awesome Robot player,

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:28.910
and then we're going
to put a semi-colon.

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:30.970
Yeah, because you've
got to do that.

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:34.200
Then we'll import
everything in Battlecode.

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:41.090
So, we can use the Battlecode,
the Battlecode API which

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:44.440
is here in
battlecode.common.star.

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:47.280
So that'll give us everything
that's in the Java Docs.

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:51.080
So, what I'll want to do
is have open the Java Docs,

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.080
maybe in one window
or on the side,

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:54.730
and have open this
in another window

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:56.707
so that I can bounce
back between them.

00:06:56.707 --> 00:06:58.290
I'm not going to do
that at the moment

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:01.891
because that would make
things even harder to see.

00:07:01.891 --> 00:07:03.390
So, what I'm going
to do here is I'm

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:04.840
going to increase the
text size because I

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:06.339
know some of you
at the back are not

00:07:06.339 --> 00:07:08.460
going to be able to see
100% of what I'm doing.

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.440
If you want to follow along
on your laptops, go ahead.

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:15.980
I believe we'll be able to
post this code after lecture,

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:19.910
so don't worry too
much about making sure

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:23.050
that you can type
as slowly as I can.

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:24.140
Awesome.

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:25.100
Is that too big?

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:25.910
It might be.

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:28.326
Here we're going to-- we're
just going to run straight in.

00:07:28.326 --> 00:07:30.410
So, public class RobotPlayer.

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:31.700
You've got to write that.

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:34.250
So now, so you've written that.

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:38.110
The Java IDE, you notice,
will put these brackets

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:39.690
in for us real nice.

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:44.470
And you need a run method,
public static void run.

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:48.129
And that's going to take the
argument, RobotController,

00:07:48.129 --> 00:07:49.920
and then you can name
it whatever you want.

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:52.520
I generally call it myRC.

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:58.310
So, this RobotController object
is the thing that is a robot.

00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:04.000
So, when you run this code
every robot has is its own myRC.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.070
And so, the methods of myRC,
which you'll see later,

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:09.440
will apply to that
particular robot.

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:10.830
You'll see some examples.

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:12.760
So, what I like to do
is I like to make--

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:17.661
I like to define the variable
for this RobotController

00:08:17.661 --> 00:08:18.160
object.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:19.760
I like to define
a variable so it

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:23.870
can be used throughout this
class, throughout this package.

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:29.060
So I'm going to type private
static RobotController RC.

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:33.780
And RC is going to be the
thing that I define to myRC.

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:36.260
I'm just going to say, there
you are, now you've got it

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:40.510
and I can use all of the
methods in RobotController

00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:42.549
by typing rc.

00:08:42.549 --> 00:08:46.150
and then, bingo,
right there, you

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:48.460
see Eclipse is telling me
all of the methods that

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:52.980
are in the Battlecode.common
directory that

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:54.900
are all these methods
that you can use.

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:56.680
So, right here,
it's like this is

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:59.940
a really convenient
way of doing things.

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:04.420
And so, you're going to see
that throughout today's lecture.

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:07.540
So, what I want to do
is I want to make sure

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:10.770
that I've got everything
organized in a way

00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:11.580
that I can use it.

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:13.580
Because I'm sure everybody
here has written code

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:16.300
in some language or other that
just goes on and on and on

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:18.319
and it's absolutely massive.

00:09:18.319 --> 00:09:20.360
And so, every time you
want to make a change down

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:25.490
here, and up, and down here,
you just get a headache

00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:28.470
and you have to fall over
and it's not very good.

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:31.990
Because you could be at
elevation and falling over

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:35.360
at elevation is highly damaging.

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:38.190
So, what we want is
this method will run,

00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:41.766
but if we only run it like
this let's see what happens.

00:09:41.766 --> 00:09:43.140
Can any of you
guess what's going

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:45.594
to happen if we run
Awesome Robot player?

00:09:45.594 --> 00:09:46.760
AUDIENCE: It's going to die.

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:47.190
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:47.800
It's going to die.

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:49.430
Can you tell me why
it's going to die?

00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:52.010
AUDIENCE: Because run will
reach the end of the method.

00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:53.010
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:55.460
That's right, because run will
reach the end of a method.

00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:57.980
So, both of the teams explode.

00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:01.116
I'm kind of curious which
team won that match.

00:10:01.116 --> 00:10:01.740
Let's see here.

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:04.030
It says they both died.

00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:05.740
Ah, Team A won.

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:09.780
Good thing to know, Team A
will win if both teams die.

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:13.566
So, let's make a while true.

00:10:13.566 --> 00:10:15.440
Yeah, yeah, all right,
the game's unbalanced.

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:16.390
I recognize that.

00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:19.570
We'll patch it in, I don't know,
in two seconds or ten minutes,

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:20.700
or whatever.

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:25.850
We're up to-- did I mention
that we're up to 1.1.0.

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:28.040
So, definitely go install that.

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:30.820
1.1.1, that's so fast.

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:33.050
Our development
cycle is amazing.

00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:35.330
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:38.840
PROFESSOR: So, while true
will just keep looping and so

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:40.622
let's try this,
let's do while true.

00:10:40.622 --> 00:10:41.580
What's going to happen?

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:45.060
Can anybody tell me what's going
to happen when I do while true?

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:47.237
Something that's undesirable.

00:10:47.237 --> 00:10:50.040
AUDIENCE: It's going to stall?

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:53.509
PROFESSOR: These guys are
going to use 10,000 bytecodes

00:10:53.509 --> 00:10:55.800
because they just keep looping,
while true, while true,

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:56.758
while true, while true.

00:10:56.758 --> 00:10:58.350
And I guess, this
one comparison,

00:10:58.350 --> 00:11:00.683
this going to the end of the
loop and coming to the top,

00:11:00.683 --> 00:11:02.220
I guess, costs some
non-zero amount.

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:05.630
So, they end up reaching their
bytecode limit, that's no good.

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:08.800
So if we do RC.yield
that ends the turn.

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:14.140
So, whatever happens here
above rc.yield will happen

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:16.540
and then it will go
to the next round.

00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:20.562
So now the bytecode usage
for each robot, you'll see--

00:11:20.562 --> 00:11:23.020
and right now all we've got
are these headquarters robots--

00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:24.560
the bytecodes used is three.

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:26.310
I'll just have to read
it out because it's

00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:27.750
so small you can't see.

00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:29.370
Yeah.

00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:31.480
Yeah, it's three so
that's fantastic.

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:33.780
That's the minimum
that you can get.

00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:36.420
All right, so now we're
going to put real stuff in.

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:38.710
We want the headquarters
to behave differently

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:39.650
from the robots.

00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:42.140
For example, because the
headquarters can never move,

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:43.380
it can't walk around.

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:46.522
So let's use if rc.

00:11:46.522 --> 00:11:49.630
Now, what we want is we want to
figure out what type of robot

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:53.140
it is, so let's look at
the different options here.

00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:54.576
Oh look, there is an rc.getType.

00:11:58.320 --> 00:11:59.030
Yeah.

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:01.000
All right, so now
we can just say

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.260
if that = RobotType.SOLDIER.

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:07.400
That's not what I wanted.

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:10.060
Soldie-- Yeah, if
it's a soldier then

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:13.510
we can put soldier code
here and, otherwise, we

00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:15.750
can put headquarters code here.

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:20.342
So, let's make a very
simple, a very simple thing.

00:12:20.342 --> 00:12:22.050
Let's say we want to
just kill the enemy.

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:22.550
Kill them.

00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:23.850
Kill them dead.

00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:28.670
So, let's have, let's
have us do this.

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:32.480
We will define a new variable,
right here now, in this space.

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:34.810
Direction dir =
rc.getLocation.directionTo.

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:40.890
And now, we'll just-- we want
to go straight to the enemy.

00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:43.640
We want to make, we want to
find the direction to the enemy

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:45.922
and then we want to
go that direction.

00:12:45.922 --> 00:12:47.380
So it's telling me
there's an error

00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:50.360
because the directionTo
needs a direction to what.

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:52.332
So let's give it a location.

00:12:52.332 --> 00:12:53.790
We're going to give
it the location

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:54.790
rc.senseEnemyHQLocation.

00:12:57.592 --> 00:12:58.300
So, there you go.

00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:00.670
Now we've already
got the direction.

00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:02.860
I'm going to put a semicolon
at the end of the line.

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:06.180
And now, I can see I'm going
to try to go that direction.

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:08.571
To move in a direction
you've got to be active.

00:13:08.571 --> 00:13:10.070
Because there are
certain things you

00:13:10.070 --> 00:13:11.980
can do, like laying
mines and defusing them,

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:13.310
that make you inactive.

00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:15.880
So, I'm going to
check if I'm active.

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:17.920
If rc.

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:22.360
is active which returns a
Boolean true if I'm active.

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:24.720
Well then, let's go
ahead and try to move.

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:26.610
And we'll see what
happens when we

00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:30.810
try this, rc.move
in direction dir.

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:32.310
And so, now we're
just going to see,

00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:33.330
we're going to see what happens.

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:34.160
Oh, what's this?

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:36.700
It's telling me that an
unhandled exception is here.

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:39.100
Move can throw exceptions.

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:43.130
And so what we do is we put
in add throws declaration.

00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:46.040
So then, up here
RobotController is

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:49.900
going to throw an error if
this thing has a problem.

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:51.770
And this is a way
you can use-- this

00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:53.619
is Java's built-in
form of debugging.

00:13:53.619 --> 00:13:56.160
And you're going to find it very
useful because when you have

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.240
a problem, it'll tell
you what the problem is.

00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:00.040
So let's go ahead and do that.

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:02.880
Hm, well, the problem is
we don't have any soldiers,

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:05.160
we can't produce any
units, so there's

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:06.910
nobody who can run this code.

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:09.820
So, let's go ahead and add in
some unit spawning abilities

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:10.759
right over here.

00:14:10.759 --> 00:14:12.550
So I'm going to go to
example folks player,

00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:14.840
open up
robotplayer.Java, and I'm

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:18.420
going to copy this part
which is for if the robot is

00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:19.560
a headquarters.

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:22.018
And I'm just going to go ahead
and paste it right in there.

00:14:22.018 --> 00:14:24.060
And now, all of a sudden,
I'm spawning units

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:27.230
at random directions around
myself as the headquarters.

00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:29.939
So now, we should have units
in our Awesome Robot player

00:14:29.939 --> 00:14:31.480
and they start to
run at one another.

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:33.320
Oh, but something
strange is happening,

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:35.380
when they run into one
another it seems like they

00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:38.430
are immediately colliding
and exploding, boom.

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:41.600
That one exploded, and then that
one exploded, and that one did.

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:42.900
That's weird looking, isn't it?

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:45.350
It almost looks like this
guy is changing color,

00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:48.420
but no, they're running into
each other and exploding.

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:51.104
And the problem, it's not just
that they're going too fast,

00:14:51.104 --> 00:14:52.520
because that isn't
the thing, it's

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:54.380
that there's a game
action exception.

00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:57.930
And you can see here that
there's tons of exceptions.

00:14:57.930 --> 00:14:59.170
And they all showed up here.

00:14:59.170 --> 00:15:01.640
And I can be like, OK, I don't
understand anything at all,

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:05.400
I can't read any of this
language, oh, but look,

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:07.530
it says robotplayer.Java:15.

00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:09.170
I can just click
there and it shows

00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:11.120
me what's throwing
the exception.

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:12.060
Oh, it's this line.

00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:14.730
Oh, I see, I see, it's
having trouble moving there

00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:16.840
because, maybe, there's
something in the way.

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:19.870
So let's also stipulate that rc.

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:21.247
move in the direction.

00:15:21.247 --> 00:15:22.830
This is another
method that's provided

00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:25.070
to you that lets you check
whether the direction is

00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:25.990
movable.

00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:29.160
So now, when we run
the code, they're

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:31.190
going to just go
to the middle, kiss

00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:33.000
and kill each other
nice and slow.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.100
Just like that.

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:35.307
Wow, that's beautiful.

00:15:35.307 --> 00:15:36.140
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:37.556
PROFESSOR: And I
think that's just

00:15:37.556 --> 00:15:41.220
going to happen all day long
until the end of, see when you

00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:43.710
get past a certain number
of rounds, the headquarters

00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:45.670
begin to take end
of round damage.

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:48.020
So you can see, the headquarters
are just going to die.

00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:48.960
And that happens.

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:50.660
And they both die at once.

00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:53.104
And I believe player
A will have won.

00:15:53.104 --> 00:15:54.048
Oh no, player B won.

00:15:54.048 --> 00:15:55.510
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:15:55.510 --> 00:15:58.415
PROFESSOR: Now, let me
tell you, that's balanced.

00:15:58.415 --> 00:16:00.740
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:02.920
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so we
know what we're doing.

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:07.570
All right, this is starting
to get cluttered, right,

00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:08.740
I'm not happy with this.

00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:12.640
I'm not a neat freak,
my wife kind of is.

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:14.874
No, I shouldn't say anything
about my wife on this

00:16:14.874 --> 00:16:16.290
because it's going
to be recorded.

00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:19.170
No, she's not a neat freak,
she's a very wonderful woman.

00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:22.109
OK, so, god I'm in
so much trouble.

00:16:22.109 --> 00:16:24.400
All right, all right, so
here's what we're going to do.

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:26.983
We're going to make a new method
that will clean the place up.

00:16:26.983 --> 00:16:32.980
We'll call it public static
void, we'll call it hqCode.

00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:35.360
This is the headquarters
code and it's the stuff

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:36.990
that I want the
headquarters to do.

00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:40.000
And I'm just going
to copy this in here

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:45.700
and then I'm going to
put hqCode there, bing.

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:49.150
So now, I'm calling this method
which I've defined below.

00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:53.120
And that'll just insert
that code right in there,

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:54.151
really convenient.

00:16:54.151 --> 00:16:55.650
Now, can anybody
tell me why there's

00:16:55.650 --> 00:16:58.517
a red underline under spawn?

00:16:58.517 --> 00:16:59.850
AUDIENCE: Game action exception.

00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:01.600
PROFESSOR: Yeah, a
game action exception.

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:04.530
So what'll happen is I'll
just click on this button

00:17:04.530 --> 00:17:07.788
and now this code
will have-- this guy

00:17:07.788 --> 00:17:08.829
will throw the exception.

00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:11.069
So, exceptions from
here will throw up

00:17:11.069 --> 00:17:14.160
and they'll throw to here and
then they'll throw even more.

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:17.074
Now, let's say
that we don't want

00:17:17.074 --> 00:17:18.740
to throw them all the
way up to the top.

00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:21.980
Because you don't want run
to ever throw an exception

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:24.300
because it causes
your robot to explode.

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:29.370
So, how do you prevent thrown
things from getting out?

00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:31.942
If Billy throws
me a football, how

00:17:31.942 --> 00:17:33.400
do I keep the
football from hitting

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:34.800
my house, which is behind me?

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:35.600
AUDIENCE: Catch it.

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:37.100
PROFESSOR: That's
right, I catch it.

00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:38.950
OK, and in Java,
the way that that's

00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:41.570
done-- I know a lot of you
this already, but some of you

00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:43.611
don't and you're going to
think that was a really

00:17:43.611 --> 00:17:47.380
clever analogy-- is you
put try on the outside.

00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:52.250
All right, and then you put,
I think I want to put it here,

00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:53.870
I want to put catch here.

00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:54.490
Yeah.

00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:57.080
And so, specifically,
I want to make sure

00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:58.450
that I catch the exception.

00:17:58.450 --> 00:18:00.290
So, I'll go, I'll
catch exception

00:18:00.290 --> 00:18:03.590
e, which will be whatever
exception comes out of try

00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:05.070
will go into e.

00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:06.980
Now, you see that the
tabbing is messed up

00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:08.770
because try should
have a tab after it.

00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:10.990
So I just highlight
this and I do control I

00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:13.310
and that automatically
tabs it out.

00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:16.570
95% of you knew that
already, but the 1%, the 5%--

00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:20.170
I can add-- the 5% that
didn't know are like, oh,

00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:23.250
that saved me so much
time, I'm so happy.

00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:25.310
Yeah, so you we're going
to catch the exception

00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:28.660
and then we're going to
do System.out.printline

00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:32.790
and we're just going to
say "caught exception

00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:36.270
before it killed us."

00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:38.310
Yeah, and we're going
to just print it.

00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:43.126
So we're going to go
e.printStack.Trace,

00:18:43.126 --> 00:18:45.250
and we'll pick the third
one because it looks good.

00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:48.000
Yeah, so now when
there's an error

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.470
it'll just print down to here,
rather than killing the robot.

00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:54.900
At the same time, I should
mention, that any time a try

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:58.340
finds an error and moves to
catch you get 500 bytecode

00:18:58.340 --> 00:18:59.550
penalty right there.

00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:02.110
So, that's not a great
way to write code.

00:19:02.110 --> 00:19:04.282
You want to avoid,
you want to avoid

00:19:04.282 --> 00:19:05.490
having the exceptions at all.

00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:07.330
All right, all right,
but we're getting

00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:10.050
stuck because we haven't
had as much killing

00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:11.930
as we really wanted to have.

00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:20.300
So, I've got an idea for how to
make code that kills the enemy.

00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:26.380
So, let's go with that idea that
I have, that I definitely have,

00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:29.400
and I'm not coming
up with on the spot.

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:31.510
So that, let's--
that was a joke,

00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:33.590
I actually am not coming
up with it on the spot.

00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:36.230
I'm so offended that you
didn't find that it was joke.

00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:38.360
I just have to find out
where it is in the notes.

00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:44.040
It's in, it's in,
capture encampments,

00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:47.180
oh, yeah, let's not
capture an encampment yet,

00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:50.170
because that's not as exciting
as-- because what we'd really

00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:52.240
like to do is just
defeat the enemy

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:57.610
and then we'll worry
about shaming them

00:19:57.610 --> 00:20:00.510
into a greater
defeat, subsequently.

00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:02.870
So, let's see here,
if you're a soldier,

00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:06.150
maybe the right
thing to do is start

00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:08.860
by massing up your
troops in a place.

00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:11.760
So, let's get a place
to mass up the troops.

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:14.190
Now, maybe you only
want to do this once.

00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:16.950
It's like a rally
point for everybody.

00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:18.427
So, let's get this rally point.

00:20:18.427 --> 00:20:20.510
I'm going to make it here
because I want everybody

00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:22.780
to know where this
rally point is.

00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:25.030
So, a rally point
is a map location

00:20:25.030 --> 00:20:28.550
because you want everybody
to localize around a place.

00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:30.560
Now, a map location
is yet another object,

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:36.640
like RobotController, and it has
its own methods and properties

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:39.220
associated with it that you
can find in the Java Docs

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:41.790
and that you can call-- and
that you can find your own way.

00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:45.381
So, let's do this,
MapLocation rallyPoint.

00:20:45.381 --> 00:20:47.130
Yeah, we're just going
to rally somewhere.

00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:49.860
This is going to be a
good strategy, trust me

00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:51.260
you're going to be excited.

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:53.950
So, let's do, let's find
the rally point, start out.

00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:56.010
So, let's make a function
because it's already

00:20:56.010 --> 00:21:01.300
getting far too fluffy, I think.

00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:02.800
So, let's find the
rally point here.

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:06.390
We'll say rallyPoint
= findRallyPoint.

00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:07.340
Yeah.

00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:08.740
Now, where should we rally?

00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:10.691
I think a decent place--
oh, look at this,

00:21:10.691 --> 00:21:12.190
it's even going to
help me out here.

00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:13.606
It noticed that
there's no method,

00:21:13.606 --> 00:21:16.680
so I can just click here and
it'll make me a nice method.

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:19.100
Look at that, it's
just like this hqCode

00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:20.690
with the private
static and then it

00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:22.870
has the type that it returns.

00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:25.870
See, this time we're making a
function that returns a type.

00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:30.000
This didn't return anything,
it just did code here.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.172
But now, we want it
to spit out an answer.

00:21:32.172 --> 00:21:34.380
So, we're going to have it
return a map location when

00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:35.430
it's done.

00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:38.626
So, what we'll do is we're going
to get some location between us

00:21:38.626 --> 00:21:40.250
and the enemy, seems
like a great place

00:21:40.250 --> 00:21:41.650
to rally our troops.

00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:43.190
So, between us and the enemy.

00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:44.960
Let's see, the
enemy location-- so,

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:47.350
I'm just going to make this
nice and simple-- MapLocation

00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:48.224
enemyLoc.

00:21:48.224 --> 00:21:49.890
You can define variables
anyway, this'll

00:21:49.890 --> 00:21:51.631
be local to this function.

00:21:51.631 --> 00:21:53.130
The enemy location
is rc.senseEnemy.

00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:57.490
Yeah, there.

00:21:57.490 --> 00:22:01.450
OK, MapLocation, our location
is rc.senseHQLocation.

00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:05.230
Yeah.

00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:06.874
And now, I want to
find the average.

00:22:06.874 --> 00:22:09.040
I'm not going to do it in
the smartest possible way,

00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:11.289
I'm going to do it in a way
that's easy to understand.

00:22:11.289 --> 00:22:13.520
Is I'm going to say
there's an integer

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:20.700
x which is enemyLoc.x
+ ourLoc.x.

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:24.090
All right, now, I guess if you
took the average of the two

00:22:24.090 --> 00:22:27.000
that would be in between,
right, that would

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.997
be in between the two.

00:22:29.997 --> 00:22:32.080
But we don't want it
completely in between the two

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:35.130
because we want to just
move a little bit out.

00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:38.360
So let's make it more of ourLoc
and less of theirs, so three

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:39.130
of ours.

00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:42.410
And now we put a
multiply and that

00:22:42.410 --> 00:22:45.300
should get us one quarter
of the way to the enemy,

00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:47.830
because it's mostly
us and somewhat them.

00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:48.450
Yeah.

00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:50.575
We'll do that for y as well.

00:22:50.575 --> 00:22:53.200
There's probably smarter ways of
doing it than just writing out

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:55.380
two lines, but
it's pretty clear.

00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:56.840
And now, what we'll
do is we'll use

00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:58.850
the constructor
for map location.

00:22:58.850 --> 00:23:05.650
So, we'll say mapLocation
rallyPoint = new MapLocation

00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:09.930
and we give it an x and a y.

00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:10.810
Yeah.

00:23:10.810 --> 00:23:14.180
Yeah, all right, now we can
just say return rallyPoint.

00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:17.060
OK, so now, we're going to
try to go to the rally point.

00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:21.070
RallyPoint has been defined
here, that's useful.

00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:23.800
So now, later we don't have
to give it a direction.

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:28.065
We can just say Direction dir
= getLocation.DirectionTo.

00:23:28.065 --> 00:23:30.490
Now we'll go to the
rallyPoint instead.

00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:32.490
Yes, yes, to the rallyPoint.

00:23:36.530 --> 00:23:40.680
Let's see if our robots are
going to the rallyPoint.

00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:43.900
I recommend that you try
running your code every time

00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:45.761
you make a significant change.

00:23:45.761 --> 00:23:47.760
And look, they did, they
went to the rallyPoint,

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:49.790
but they went there
in a dumb way.

00:23:49.790 --> 00:23:51.980
Because when one of them
was in front of the other,

00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:54.200
they couldn't go around.

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:56.980
Because now, this guy
can't spawn anymore robots.

00:23:56.980 --> 00:23:59.650
I'm pretty sure he's trying,
but it's not working.

00:23:59.650 --> 00:24:02.340
In fact, what error
am I getting here?

00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:04.880
I'm getting you cannot move
in the direction non or Omni.

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:07.030
That's an interesting problem.

00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:10.290
That's the problem that when
a robot is on top of the spot

00:24:10.290 --> 00:24:13.070
he shouldn't try to move to
the spot that he's on top of.

00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:16.380
So, we should also specify
that there's a distance

00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:18.570
and he should only try
moving if there's a distance.

00:24:18.570 --> 00:24:23.250
So, let's just put dist
= rc.getLocation.--

00:24:23.250 --> 00:24:26.590
do you always do that too,
I always put i before o--

00:24:26.590 --> 00:24:32.750
.distanceSquaredTo, and
distanceSquaredTo rallyPoint.

00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:35.260
Yes, that's a useful method.

00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:37.520
There are a lot of useful
methods for getLocation.

00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:38.560
And you might say,
all right, how

00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:40.434
was I supposed to know
that distanceSquaredTo

00:24:40.434 --> 00:24:41.830
was a method from getLocation.

00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:44.430
I was going to write my
own manual function that

00:24:44.430 --> 00:24:46.620
goes looking for x's
and y's, and squaring

00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:49.800
them, and subtracting them,
and so on, not that subtraction

00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:51.240
is really even relevant here.

00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:52.749
But, how was I supposed to know?

00:24:52.749 --> 00:24:54.790
Well I'll tell you how
you were supposed to know.

00:24:54.790 --> 00:24:56.850
You just go to where
you installed it.

00:24:56.850 --> 00:24:59.440
I put it in Battlecode 2013.

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:03.750
You go to doc and you go to
this thing, all classes frame,

00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:05.695
and this shows you
all the classes.

00:25:05.695 --> 00:25:08.440
And one of those classes
here is Map Location.

00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:11.360
And under Map Location, you see
that you can add map locations

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:15.380
to directions, you can add
them to x's and y's, you

00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:17.230
can use directionTo,
distanceSquared,

00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:19.650
you can check whether two map
locations are equal to one

00:25:19.650 --> 00:25:20.990
another, if they're
adjacent to one another.

00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:22.170
That's pretty useful.

00:25:22.170 --> 00:25:26.320
So, having a working
understanding or memorization

00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:29.630
of these things will
help you along the way.

00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:31.180
So, now we've got
distanceSquaredTo.

00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:34.900
So now, we only want to
move toward the enemy.

00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:38.610
So, if our distance
is greater than 0,

00:25:38.610 --> 00:25:40.250
then we'll try moving there.

00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:42.530
Otherwise, let's not,
because it's just

00:25:42.530 --> 00:25:44.030
going to end up
giving us trouble.

00:25:44.030 --> 00:25:47.300
And once again I'm going to do
control i to do this indenting.

00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:48.980
But this is getting
somewhat cluttered,

00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:52.230
so why don't I just make
this soldierCode, especially

00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:55.340
here when everything
is a giant font 16.

00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:56.960
So, this is soldierCode
and I'll just

00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:58.710
go ahead and have
it automatically

00:25:58.710 --> 00:25:59.940
create me that method.

00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:02.230
I'm going to go ahead and
put this in the method.

00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:04.660
And now rc.move has got
a throw declaration.

00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:06.217
Do you see this?

00:26:06.217 --> 00:26:07.800
Pretty soon I'm not
even going to need

00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:10.732
to be here because it's doing
everything for me, my goodness.

00:26:10.732 --> 00:26:12.440
So now, they should
go to the rally point

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:14.530
and they shouldn't be throwing
quite as many exceptions

00:26:14.530 --> 00:26:15.363
as they were before.

00:26:15.363 --> 00:26:18.150
Oh, look at that, in
the game output window

00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:21.710
you see no exceptions from
round 0 to 5,000, excellent.

00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:24.430
But, again, they're just
stuck behind one another.

00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:26.620
How can we make it so
that they're not stuck?

00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:29.150
Well, here's a
good way to do It.

00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:31.380
So, here you're only
trying one direction,

00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:35.170
but now let's make a way
to try multiple directions.

00:26:35.170 --> 00:26:38.940
The way that I'm about to show
has its own emergent complexity

00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:39.610
built in.

00:26:39.610 --> 00:26:43.090
You're going to like this
a lot, I believe, so.

00:26:43.090 --> 00:26:45.120
Yes, let's do it.

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:46.580
Let's define a list.

00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:49.682
Now, lists are defined this way,
you put an open square bracket

00:26:49.682 --> 00:26:51.390
and I'm going to make
a list of integers.

00:26:51.390 --> 00:26:54.464
Because I'm also going to
use some tricks for direction

00:26:54.464 --> 00:26:56.630
because a lot of you are
probably thinking, oh gosh,

00:26:56.630 --> 00:27:00.250
I noticed in the Java Docs
that direction-- oh here, I'm

00:27:00.250 --> 00:27:03.160
going to go to Java Docs
again-- direction is here

00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:05.190
and there's all
these directions,

00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:06.885
east, north, northeast, blah.

00:27:06.885 --> 00:27:08.740
There are eight directions.

00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:10.730
I can rotate them
left and right,

00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:13.350
but am I really going to
enjoy rotating them again

00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:16.750
and again to find which
direction I'm going to.

00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:20.010
OK, I could go forward,
if forward is blocked,

00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:23.150
then rotate the direction
left, if the left is blocked,

00:27:23.150 --> 00:27:25.220
then rotate-- no that
would be actually really

00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:26.320
annoying to write.

00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:29.034
And it's not the most
elegant way to do it.

00:27:29.034 --> 00:27:30.450
The way we're going
to do is we're

00:27:30.450 --> 00:27:32.440
going to get the
direction values

00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:35.790
and then we're going to
use the direction list.

00:27:35.790 --> 00:27:38.809
So, the direction list
consists of these eight things.

00:27:38.809 --> 00:27:40.350
I believe it starts
at north and then

00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:43.200
it goes around to northwest.

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:46.910
And so, direction
list at 0 is north.

00:27:46.910 --> 00:27:49.360
And so, I'm going to show you
how we're going to do that

00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:52.090
and what amazing result it
has, because a lot of you

00:27:52.090 --> 00:27:53.510
already know how
to code, but you

00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:55.220
don't know what amazing
result it's going to have,

00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:56.090
or maybe you do.

00:27:56.090 --> 00:28:00.095
So, this integer I'm going
to call the directionOffsets.

00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:05.540
And you can define
an integer list

00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:08.350
by setting it equal
to this construct.

00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:11.230
So, I'm just going
to put curly brackets

00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:17.210
and now I'm going to do
0, 1, -1, 2, -2, yes.

00:28:17.210 --> 00:28:20.520
So, that now gets me
some direction offsets

00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:23.090
and I need to start
checking directions.

00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:32.590
So I'll use for integer d among
the list directionOffsets.

00:28:32.590 --> 00:28:35.650
So now, this for loop
will loop again and again

00:28:35.650 --> 00:28:40.380
and it'll put one of these
integers in each time it runs.

00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:43.040
So, the first times
it runs, d will be 0,

00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:46.370
the second time d
will be 1, and so on.

00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:49.610
So this is for d
in directionOffsets

00:28:49.610 --> 00:28:52.048
and there needs to be an s.

00:28:52.048 --> 00:28:55.350
And what I'll check is if I
can move in that direction.

00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:56.980
So, let's go ahead
and check that.

00:28:56.980 --> 00:28:59.347
Oh, by the way, let's
simplify matters a little,

00:28:59.347 --> 00:29:01.180
because we've got is
active here but there's

00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:03.840
no reason to look at directions
if you're not active.

00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:07.274
So, let's go ahead and put
this is active up here.

00:29:07.274 --> 00:29:09.690
Oh gosh, the guys of you who
are following on your laptops

00:29:09.690 --> 00:29:12.750
must be just frantic
at this point,

00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:14.890
yes, because it's
like that, it's

00:29:14.890 --> 00:29:17.010
very emotional, very personal.

00:29:17.010 --> 00:29:19.920
So then, what we'll do is
we'll check if you can move.

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:22.190
If you can move-- Oh, but
wait this isn't right,

00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:23.980
what direction is now important?

00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:26.965
Direction
lookingatCurrently-- you

00:29:26.965 --> 00:29:29.550
can name these whatever you
want-- the direction you're

00:29:29.550 --> 00:29:32.630
currently looking
at is the following.

00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:35.350
First, you want to
look at direction.

00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:39.930
And so, see dir up here is the
direction to the rally point.

00:29:39.930 --> 00:29:43.410
So, we'll look at
direction we'll say, OK,

00:29:43.410 --> 00:29:47.030
what is, oh, let's
see here, ordinal?

00:29:47.030 --> 00:29:49.760
Ordinal gives me
which number this

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:51.870
is in the list of
eight directions.

00:29:51.870 --> 00:29:55.831
So, if I'm currently
looking at north,

00:29:55.831 --> 00:29:58.330
that is to say if the direction
of the rally point is north,

00:29:58.330 --> 00:30:01.070
then dir.ordinal will return 0.

00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:06.420
Because the list of directions
starts with north and in Java

00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:11.590
the index of a list starts at
0, so the first element is at 0.

00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:14.500
So dir.ordinal gets me 0.

00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:18.630
And then I'll add the
direction offset number

00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:21.460
and now I will index
into directions again.

00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:26.300
So, I'll say Direction.values
is a list of directions.

00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:28.410
And the part of
that that I take,

00:30:28.410 --> 00:30:33.150
indicated by the square
brackets, will be dir.ordinal

00:30:33.150 --> 00:30:34.260
+ d.

00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:36.630
I'll add 8 to make sure
that's it's not negative,

00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:39.610
and then I'll do mod
8, the %8 is a mod 8.

00:30:39.610 --> 00:30:42.450
And you're going to find,
this may be alien to you

00:30:42.450 --> 00:30:46.190
to begin with, but you'll find
that this kind of construction

00:30:46.190 --> 00:30:47.280
helps you out immensely.

00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:49.760
So now, you're looking
at a direction currently.

00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:52.060
If you can move in that
direction, what you want to do

00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:54.280
is leave this loop.

00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:57.500
You don't want to stay
in the loop anymore.

00:30:57.500 --> 00:31:00.080
It's giving me this,
oh yes, semicolon?

00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:02.160
No, that's not right.

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:03.700
Oh right, right, if I can move.

00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:05.470
I forgot to put if I can.

00:31:05.470 --> 00:31:09.590
Yeah, thank you for
catching that me, yes.

00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:11.990
If I can move the direction
I'm currently looking at I

00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:15.230
want to leave this loop, so
I'm throwing a lot at you,

00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:17.290
but here you go.

00:31:17.290 --> 00:31:20.880
We'll name this thing
the lookAround loop.

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:25.370
And now, we can do
break lookAround.

00:31:25.370 --> 00:31:30.650
And now, that will get
us out of this piece.

00:31:30.650 --> 00:31:31.450
Yeah.

00:31:31.450 --> 00:31:33.200
Everybody likes
to be splashed in.

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:39.300
Nobody likes the first 27 pages
of that intro to C++ book that

00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:42.140
talks about declaring variables
and what the hell private

00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:43.020
static means.

00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:45.110
It doesn't matter what
private static means,

00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:48.550
you don't need to know,
you don't need to know.

00:31:48.550 --> 00:31:49.470
Don't you think?

00:31:49.470 --> 00:31:50.050
I hate that.

00:31:50.050 --> 00:31:52.650
I tried to learn
languages so many times,

00:31:52.650 --> 00:31:55.180
here I'm thumping the desk.

00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:59.220
Anyway, I have
nothing but animosity

00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:01.329
for their correct
ways of doing things.

00:32:01.329 --> 00:32:03.495
That's why I don't study
number theory, my goodness.

00:32:03.495 --> 00:32:04.195
AUDIENCE: Nonsense.

00:32:04.195 --> 00:32:05.653
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
because they prove

00:32:05.653 --> 00:32:08.490
that addition works before
they do any addition.

00:32:08.490 --> 00:32:10.930
I can't imagine how
they get anything

00:32:10.930 --> 00:32:12.890
done under those circumstances.

00:32:12.890 --> 00:32:17.236
So, you can see here that
nothing works at all.

00:32:17.236 --> 00:32:18.110
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:21.760
PROFESSOR: Let's see, the robot
is spawned, but it never moves.

00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:25.640
OK, so it can move, but it
never actually did move.

00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:27.900
That's right, so what we
need to do is make it move.

00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:31.630
So, within this loop, we've
just exited the lookAround loop,

00:32:31.630 --> 00:32:32.810
that's this one.

00:32:32.810 --> 00:32:37.550
So, we're just going to
put rc.move-- please move,

00:32:37.550 --> 00:32:41.210
please move-- atCurrently.

00:32:41.210 --> 00:32:48.030
Yes, when this guy
moves-- Did I-- Oh, scope.

00:32:48.030 --> 00:32:49.330
Oh man, these guys are smart.

00:32:49.330 --> 00:32:53.500
So, you see here that
this is inside this block

00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:55.080
so it can't be
accessed from outside.

00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:59.870
So, what I'll do is I'll define
it outside and I'll just equal,

00:32:59.870 --> 00:33:03.590
I'll pre-initialize it at dir
and then when I use it in here

00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:05.270
it'll be accessible
to that out there.

00:33:05.270 --> 00:33:07.120
Look, you think
I made a mistake,

00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:09.630
but it was actually
deliberate so that everybody

00:33:09.630 --> 00:33:13.390
would know about this scope
problem, as you refer to it.

00:33:13.390 --> 00:33:18.190
Although, to be honest, Scope
to me just means Listerine.

00:33:18.190 --> 00:33:21.520
All right, so now, what they're
doing, it's hard to see,

00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:23.490
but they're moving
around one another

00:33:23.490 --> 00:33:24.900
and they're oscillating.

00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:25.400
See that?

00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:27.030
Look at yellow.

00:33:27.030 --> 00:33:30.360
He's going around and
that's because he's

00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:33.029
looking at the best
direction that he can go in.

00:33:33.029 --> 00:33:34.070
Yeah, that's pretty cool.

00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:36.120
What is going on here?

00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:38.710
Cannot move in the given
direction west, south, blah,

00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:39.550
blah, blah.

00:33:39.550 --> 00:33:42.180
Now why can't they
move in that direction

00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:43.750
is an interesting
question to ask.

00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:46.730
And it may be
because some of them

00:33:46.730 --> 00:33:49.470
are entirely surrounded
by other robots.

00:33:49.470 --> 00:33:52.744
This guy, for
example, may end up

00:33:52.744 --> 00:33:54.410
being entirely
surrounded by the robots.

00:33:54.410 --> 00:33:56.750
One of the problems
that you will encounter

00:33:56.750 --> 00:34:00.690
is that every round
robots move and they

00:34:00.690 --> 00:34:03.020
don't move synchronously.

00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:05.310
So it'll be really
instructive, if I

00:34:05.310 --> 00:34:07.890
had the time I would
show you that the number

00:34:07.890 --> 00:34:11.270
of adjacent robots is not the
number that you might expect.

00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:13.855
Because, for example,
let's say this guy

00:34:13.855 --> 00:34:14.980
wants to move to the right.

00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:17.070
Let's just say he does.

00:34:17.070 --> 00:34:18.880
He can't move to
the right this turn

00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:21.894
if he executes before this guy.

00:34:21.894 --> 00:34:23.810
Let's say they both want
to move to the right.

00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:25.960
But if this guy
executes first then

00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:28.120
he'll move to the right,
that'll take place,

00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:30.199
and then when this guy
looks surround himself

00:34:30.199 --> 00:34:32.239
he's going to see
an empty spot there.

00:34:32.239 --> 00:34:36.130
It can be very
confusing for debugging.

00:34:36.130 --> 00:34:39.210
So, that's going to happen.

00:34:39.210 --> 00:34:41.810
And you might ask, OK, OK,
I recognize that nothing

00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:44.550
can run synchronously because
then two robots can try

00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:47.980
to move onto the same tile and
who knows what would happen.

00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:51.000
It could be like Pauli
Exclusion Principle is violated,

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.500
two electrons occupy
the same orbital

00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:58.140
and the world comes to an end,
a screeching halt, as it were.

00:34:58.140 --> 00:34:59.200
So, here's how we do it.

00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:00.400
We use the robot ID.

00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:03.040
Now this is going to come back
later, so don't think that it's

00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:05.040
just an obscure little
thing, this is important.

00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:06.900
So, you can see here that
when I click on a robot

00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:08.630
it tells me-- Oh, is
this bothering you?

00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:10.100
I can tell it's
bothering half of you.

00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:11.599
You've got like a
twitch developing,

00:35:11.599 --> 00:35:14.350
you're starting to shake,
the sweats are coming out.

00:35:14.350 --> 00:35:16.780
No sorry, that's me.

00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:18.990
So, the robot, you
can see here, this

00:35:18.990 --> 00:35:20.860
is robot 38, the headquarters.

00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:24.740
This is robot 115, the lower
the robot number, the sooner it

00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:26.830
executes, because they
execute in that order.

00:35:26.830 --> 00:35:29.710
And I think when a robot dies
it's number becomes available

00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:31.675
and another one can
spawn into that number,

00:35:31.675 --> 00:35:32.800
in case you wanted to know.

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:34.130
That's all too nitty gritty.

00:35:34.130 --> 00:35:35.620
So anyway, there we've got it.

00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:39.170
Let's start owning
some noobs as it were.

00:35:39.170 --> 00:35:41.150
Let's destroy the enemy.

00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:45.460
It's not going to be as exciting
if we're all the same person.

00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:48.810
So, let's make sure
that we know who we are.

00:35:48.810 --> 00:35:51.900
Now, one problem here is that
this only goes to rallyPoint.

00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:55.000
Let's put in an argument
to soldierCode and change

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:56.520
the name so it's
more reasonable.

00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:59.440
So, that it's goToLocation.

00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:01.060
That's kind of nice.

00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:05.570
And we'll give it
MapLocation whereToGo.

00:36:05.570 --> 00:36:09.920
Yeah, now we'll just
put this in here

00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:12.720
and now this goToLocation
function can be reused.

00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:16.340
So first, we'll just
goToLocation rallyPoint

00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:18.880
and then after a certain
number of turns maybe

00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:20.466
then we'll just go
to the enemy base.

00:36:20.466 --> 00:36:22.340
Because we'll have all
these clumped up guys,

00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:25.030
we'll be ready to
own some noobs.

00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:26.640
So let's do that.

00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:30.150
Let's go to the enemy
base, let's kill them dead.

00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:33.300
So let's say here,
how are we going

00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:35.070
to figure out what round it is?

00:36:35.070 --> 00:36:38.904
This is sort of an obscure
function, Clock.getRoundNum.

00:36:38.904 --> 00:36:40.320
I don't think that
there's really,

00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:43.500
is there anything else under
clock that's worth looking at?

00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:46.414
Clock, get bytecode
number, oh, you

00:36:46.414 --> 00:36:48.330
can get the number of
bytecodes you have left,

00:36:48.330 --> 00:36:49.530
that's pretty useful.

00:36:49.530 --> 00:36:51.980
So you can say, oh, is it
worth doing this computation,

00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:55.600
I don't know if I need that
many extra digits of pi.

00:36:55.600 --> 00:37:00.010
So here, if my clock,
which returns an integer,

00:37:00.010 --> 00:37:04.610
if that clock number
is less than 500,

00:37:04.610 --> 00:37:08.270
yeah maybe, let's just make
it 200, we don't have all day.

00:37:08.270 --> 00:37:09.470
Yeah, we'll make it 200.

00:37:09.470 --> 00:37:11.950
If it's less than 200,
then go to the rallyPoint.

00:37:11.950 --> 00:37:17.820
If it is more than
200, or equal to 200,

00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:24.060
let's go to rc.senseEnemy--
Yeah, let's go to the enemy,

00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:25.650
let's just go ahead
and kill them.

00:37:25.650 --> 00:37:28.200
So now, we've got these
two pieces in here.

00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:31.500
We're going to take our
Awesome Robot player.

00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:33.700
We're going to play
against Hardbot.

00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:37.470
Yeah, a bot that's supposed
to be hard on my map tiny.

00:37:37.470 --> 00:37:38.382
Yeah.

00:37:38.382 --> 00:37:40.840
Cannot move and get-- Well,
let's just hope that that's not

00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:41.756
going to be a problem.

00:37:41.756 --> 00:37:43.560
OK, so I'm getting
ready, getting ready,

00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:44.560
get ready for the blitz.

00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:48.860
It's round, it's round 150,
it's round 150, go, go, yeah.

00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:51.120
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:54.560
PROFESSOR: Yes,
knocking them out.

00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:55.850
Wa-bam.

00:37:55.850 --> 00:37:57.220
Wa-bam.

00:37:57.220 --> 00:38:00.200
One thing that's
important is you've

00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:03.450
got give yourself a little pat
on the back from time to time.

00:38:03.450 --> 00:38:07.974
That's what teammates are for,
to pat each other on the back.

00:38:07.974 --> 00:38:09.390
My brother always
used to do that.

00:38:09.390 --> 00:38:12.010
He'd give me a giant five
star, when you slap someone

00:38:12.010 --> 00:38:15.250
so hard on the back that
it leaves a handprint.

00:38:15.250 --> 00:38:18.227
Yeah, but that let me know that
he cared, that was important.

00:38:18.227 --> 00:38:19.184
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:38:19.184 --> 00:38:20.850
PROFESSOR: I think
every younger brother

00:38:20.850 --> 00:38:23.490
needs that and if you're the
oldest brother in your family

00:38:23.490 --> 00:38:27.510
then just hit the
guy twice as hard.

00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:29.520
So yeah, you see here
that that worked.

00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:32.400
I might just go ahead and send
myself an email saying Max,

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:35.290
you sly dog, you made a player
that beats the hard bot.

00:38:35.290 --> 00:38:37.540
I mean, the hard bot's
not actually very hard.

00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:39.742
All right, all right,
so we've got that.

00:38:39.742 --> 00:38:44.080
That was good, that was good,
but maybe what we'd rather do

00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:48.690
is be more hunter like
about, we'll be stealthy.

00:38:48.690 --> 00:38:50.530
What I think will
be really cool is

00:38:50.530 --> 00:38:52.860
to go after the
closest enemy unit.

00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:55.880
Now, you'll find in
the documentation

00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:58.230
a lot of ways of
getting enemy data.

00:38:58.230 --> 00:39:00.230
You can sense where their
encampments are and go

00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:03.740
after those, you can sense
where your mines are,

00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:05.480
you can sense where
its headquarters are,

00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:08.430
you can sense where
the enemy robots are.

00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:11.570
And you'll probably find
yourself, at some point,

00:39:11.570 --> 00:39:13.900
going through a list and
trying to find the closest

00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:16.460
enemy, or maybe the
closest allied unit.

00:39:16.460 --> 00:39:18.580
So, we're going to do
an example of that.

00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:20.490
And what we're going
to use it for is--

00:39:20.490 --> 00:39:23.520
See, for example, this case
where they're trying to build

00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:26.030
this encampment and they're
shooting at all of our dudes,

00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:29.220
and our dudes are just,
they're getting hurt.

00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:31.814
They should just go
gang up on that guy.

00:39:31.814 --> 00:39:33.230
Why aren't they
ganging up on him?

00:39:33.230 --> 00:39:37.160
So, let's make a function
for ganging up on the enemy.

00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:39.816
And it'll require that we
locate the closest enemy.

00:39:39.816 --> 00:39:41.190
I mean, we could
probably just go

00:39:41.190 --> 00:39:43.890
to the first one
that's in the list.

00:39:43.890 --> 00:39:45.980
So, I don't know which
one should we do?

00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:49.060
In fact, how about
this, we could,

00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:52.230
we could make code--
Yeah, let's try this.

00:39:52.230 --> 00:39:53.230
OK, this is interesting.

00:39:53.230 --> 00:39:57.520
I don't always plan, but when
I do I drink-- No, nevermind,

00:39:57.520 --> 00:39:59.370
that doesn't work.

00:39:59.370 --> 00:40:01.547
So, let's see if you
can copy a package

00:40:01.547 --> 00:40:03.380
and then we'll be able
to play Awesome Robot

00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:05.940
player against
Awesomer Robot player.

00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:07.110
Yeah, paste.

00:40:07.110 --> 00:40:08.470
OK, enter a new name.

00:40:08.470 --> 00:40:10.000
Oh, that was helpful.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.930
I mean, it's not very smart,
AwesomeRobotplayer.copy?

00:40:12.930 --> 00:40:14.480
No, it's Awesomer.

00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:15.200
Yeah.

00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:17.060
Look at that, and it
even changed it for me.

00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:18.410
I tell you, I'm going
to be out of a job

00:40:18.410 --> 00:40:19.710
before the end of the week.

00:40:19.710 --> 00:40:23.350
So, what we want to do now,
in the remaining moments

00:40:23.350 --> 00:40:27.210
of lecture, is we want to
find the closest enemy robot.

00:40:27.210 --> 00:40:29.590
Now, it may be that there
are no enemy robots.

00:40:29.590 --> 00:40:31.709
This is the thing that I
was talking about before.

00:40:31.709 --> 00:40:32.750
Let's do it, let's do it.

00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:33.520
OK, try.

00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:34.561
So here, I'm a soldier.

00:40:34.561 --> 00:40:36.560
OK, I don't need to do
it if I'm a headquarters.

00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:38.143
So, let's just do
it if I'm a soldier.

00:40:38.143 --> 00:40:40.450
We'll say MapLocation
of the enemy robot

00:40:40.450 --> 00:40:43.430
because, after all, all we
currently do is go to places,

00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:45.530
we go there and
it's implied that we

00:40:45.530 --> 00:40:47.430
kill all the things
that we find.

00:40:47.430 --> 00:40:52.060
Yes, so the map location
of the closest enemy.

00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:52.950
Now, let's see here.

00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:55.200
This is only going to be
valid when there are enemies.

00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:56.750
You've got to think about this.

00:40:56.750 --> 00:40:59.790
So let's instead do, let's
get all the enemy robots.

00:40:59.790 --> 00:41:03.030
So, this is a robot list,
a list of enemy robots,

00:41:03.030 --> 00:41:04.739
we'll call it
enemyRobots, if we like.

00:41:04.739 --> 00:41:06.030
Doesn't matter what we call it.

00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:11.330
And we'll go rc.sense--
now this is the hardest

00:41:11.330 --> 00:41:13.936
thing to remember, this is the
hardest ever possible thing

00:41:13.936 --> 00:41:15.907
to remember--
senseNearbyGameObjects.

00:41:15.907 --> 00:41:16.740
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:20.940
PROFESSOR: It's hard to remember
because it's so accurate.

00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:26.640
Robot.class, so we want
robots, we want them anywhere.

00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:29.090
This is the range,
the squared range

00:41:29.090 --> 00:41:31.630
that we're interested
in picking up enemies.

00:41:31.630 --> 00:41:34.110
Now note, they won't
show up unless they

00:41:34.110 --> 00:41:36.620
are within one of my
allied units' sight range.

00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:39.130
I put in this huge
number just because I'm

00:41:39.130 --> 00:41:42.330
willing to take those.

00:41:42.330 --> 00:41:44.670
I put in a million and then
I'm going to make sure that

00:41:44.670 --> 00:41:49.510
they're enemy by doing
rc.getTeam, so that's my team,

00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:53.570
and .opponent is a team method
that gets me the opposing team.

00:41:53.570 --> 00:41:56.260
Now the two teams are
Team A and Team B.

00:41:56.260 --> 00:41:59.450
So, that's literally
written out as Team.A.

00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:03.150
So I could have written
Team.A or Team.B,

00:42:03.150 --> 00:42:05.570
but then I would have had to
check if I was Team A or Team

00:42:05.570 --> 00:42:07.530
B. So, you're better
off doing it this way.

00:42:07.530 --> 00:42:09.500
So, I'm sensing the
nearby game objects.

00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:12.860
Now, I need to know if that
gave me any game objects.

00:42:12.860 --> 00:42:14.750
So, I don't know how
big this list is.

00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:24.640
If the list has a length, if
enemyRobots.length = 0, well,

00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:26.480
then there are no enemy robots.

00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:28.970
So, I should just do the same
thing I was doing before.

00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:30.570
So, there you go.

00:42:30.570 --> 00:42:33.100
Now, we've got code
that should be working.

00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:35.590
But, if there are robots--
Now, what have I done here?

00:42:35.590 --> 00:42:37.750
I haven't commented a
single line of code.

00:42:37.750 --> 00:42:42.100
OK, enemies, no enemies nearby.

00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:42.820
Yeah.

00:42:42.820 --> 00:42:44.820
I heard somebody tell a
real zinger over there.

00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:46.460
No, I'm just kidding.

00:42:46.460 --> 00:42:50.160
So, no enemies--
OK, someone spotted.

00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:52.060
OK, enemy is spotted.

00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:54.760
So, yeah, no that's not right,
I put this in the wrong spot.

00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:57.180
You guys are not
helping me, not helping

00:42:57.180 --> 00:42:59.030
me nearly as much
as I was expecting.

00:42:59.030 --> 00:43:00.516
So, now what I'll
do is I'll loop

00:43:00.516 --> 00:43:01.640
through each of the robots.

00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:03.360
Now, I could do the
same looping thing

00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:05.490
that I did before,
where I could say,

00:43:05.490 --> 00:43:10.000
Robot arobot among enemyRobots.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.985
And then, it would put
arobot into each one,

00:43:11.985 --> 00:43:14.110
but instead I'm going to
do it a different way just

00:43:14.110 --> 00:43:15.140
to demonstrate it.

00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:18.670
I'm going to define
an integer i = 0.

00:43:18.670 --> 00:43:20.830
And then, there you go.

00:43:20.830 --> 00:43:22.910
Oh, thank you, I saw you
we're going to help me

00:43:22.910 --> 00:43:24.460
and I really appreciate it.

00:43:24.460 --> 00:43:26.450
And we'll make sure
that i-- And so, this

00:43:26.450 --> 00:43:29.735
is the format for a loop
that goes with this type.

00:43:29.735 --> 00:43:31.360
Some of you are going
to be like that's

00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:34.800
not the way that the words
work that make it explained.

00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:37.490
And I'll tell you
that you are right

00:43:37.490 --> 00:43:41.980
and you get a gold medal,
as soon as we mint them.

00:43:41.980 --> 00:43:46.095
So yeah, enemyRobots.length
and we'll do i++.

00:43:46.095 --> 00:43:48.950
So this'll make, i will
go up by one every turn.

00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:54.600
So now, I can type Robot
arobot, it's an enemy robot,

00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:59.820
= enemyRobots at i.

00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:02.150
And now, I'm going to look
through and find the closest

00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:02.560
one.

00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:04.490
Now, I'm sure somebody's going
to show me a way that I'm

00:44:04.490 --> 00:44:06.573
doing it wrong, but here's
how I'm going to do it.

00:44:06.573 --> 00:44:09.440
I'm going to keep track
of which one was closest

00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:10.590
and how close it was.

00:44:10.590 --> 00:44:12.560
So int closestDist,
and I'm going

00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:14.500
to initialize it
at a large number.

00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:18.540
And I'm going to
make it a location.

00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:22.950
And I'll do MapLocation
closestEnemy.

00:44:22.950 --> 00:44:24.800
Yeah, closestEnemy.

00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:29.910
OK, so now, we'll have--
Now this is very tricky.

00:44:29.910 --> 00:44:33.320
This little bit of sequence is
very tricky in the Battlecode

00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:33.986
API.

00:44:33.986 --> 00:44:35.360
When I first did
Battlecode, they

00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:37.930
didn't give an example of
this and it took me 10 years

00:44:37.930 --> 00:44:38.730
to figure it out.

00:44:38.730 --> 00:44:41.050
This is how to find
out where an enemy is.

00:44:41.050 --> 00:44:43.220
You type rc, that's
like you're starting

00:44:43.220 --> 00:44:47.580
from you, senseRobotInfo.

00:44:47.580 --> 00:44:52.410
All right, and then
you pass it the robot.

00:44:52.410 --> 00:44:55.066
You tell it to sense
the robot info.

00:44:55.066 --> 00:44:56.190
Now what does that get you?

00:44:56.190 --> 00:44:57.740
Does that get you the location?

00:44:57.740 --> 00:44:59.280
No, that would be
too easy. , So,

00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:02.200
that gets you a
robot info object.

00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:08.660
So, now you've got
RobotInfo arobotInfo = that.

00:45:08.660 --> 00:45:10.360
So now, I've got
some robot info.

00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:13.760
Robot Info is yet another
one of these classes.

00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:15.300
So here in the Java docs.

00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:17.700
Look at this, I keep opening
more and more of them.

00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:18.890
That's another one,
there's another one,

00:45:18.890 --> 00:45:19.460
they're multiplying.

00:45:19.460 --> 00:45:20.530
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:45:20.530 --> 00:45:24.610
PROFESSOR: So here, you could
see Robot Info, there it was.

00:45:24.610 --> 00:45:27.070
So, you can see that information
about the enemy robots

00:45:27.070 --> 00:45:29.195
can be things like the
amount of shields they have,

00:45:29.195 --> 00:45:32.440
the type of robot, its location.

00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:34.730
One of the Robot
Info things is Robot.

00:45:34.730 --> 00:45:36.810
So, what you can do is
you can sense the robot,

00:45:36.810 --> 00:45:39.380
you can get the
robot, sense its info,

00:45:39.380 --> 00:45:42.810
and then do info.Robot, and
then sense that things info,

00:45:42.810 --> 00:45:44.107
and then you'll have the info.

00:45:44.107 --> 00:45:45.690
So, you go back to
the robot and it'll

00:45:45.690 --> 00:45:46.898
be a really nice little loop.

00:45:46.898 --> 00:45:49.120
It's wonderful, it's just,
[KISSING SOUND] mmm, just

00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:50.520
great.

00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:53.210
I highly recommend
that kind of code.

00:45:53.210 --> 00:45:55.900
It just warms my heart.

00:45:55.900 --> 00:46:01.580
So, like what a little kid
does, is that computationally

00:46:01.580 --> 00:46:02.080
impressive?

00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:04.380
No, but it's cute, so
it warms it anyway.

00:46:04.380 --> 00:46:07.140
So, that was the reasoning
behind that crazy stream

00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:07.670
of logic.

00:46:07.670 --> 00:46:09.281
So, here we go,
we got Robot Info.

00:46:09.281 --> 00:46:11.280
Let's check the distance,
we'll be done with it.

00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:14.180
So we'll say that the
distance, which is an integer,

00:46:14.180 --> 00:46:16.180
equals
 arobotInfo.location.distanceSquaredTo.

00:46:21.374 --> 00:46:23.790
Of course, you can write your
own distanceSquaredTo metric

00:46:23.790 --> 00:46:26.373
or something or other, but we're
just going to do it this way.

00:46:26.373 --> 00:46:28.430
And we're going to make
it the distance from,

00:46:28.430 --> 00:46:31.470
I guess, it could be
myself, as the robot.

00:46:31.470 --> 00:46:35.640
So, distanceSquaredTo, hmm,
it's sort of hard to decide.

00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:37.990
It could be the one
that's closest to me,

00:46:37.990 --> 00:46:41.090
or let's just do
me for the moment.

00:46:41.090 --> 00:46:42.910
Maybe later we'll make
it more complicated.

00:46:42.910 --> 00:46:43.914
Actually, we're going
to run out of time

00:46:43.914 --> 00:46:45.230
and we're just going to
end up eating Indian food.

00:46:45.230 --> 00:46:46.850
But that's wonderful.

00:46:46.850 --> 00:46:49.090
How many of you have
eaten at India Samraat?

00:46:49.090 --> 00:46:51.030
That place is fantastic.

00:46:51.030 --> 00:46:53.880
Wow, oh my goodness,
you're in for such a treat.

00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:56.180
I don't know if it's
going to be considered

00:46:56.180 --> 00:46:57.860
the same level of
treat as-- Oh anway,

00:46:57.860 --> 00:46:59.110
I'm just going on and on.

00:46:59.110 --> 00:47:03.190
So if the distance that we're
currently looking at is less

00:47:03.190 --> 00:47:07.690
than the closestDist, then
we'll say that is the new

00:47:07.690 --> 00:47:12.690
closestDist, and we will
assign closestEnemy=.

00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:22.297
Well, I didn't
record it anywhere.

00:47:22.297 --> 00:47:22.880
It's this one.

00:47:26.260 --> 00:47:27.809
Yes, so there it is.

00:47:27.809 --> 00:47:28.850
That's the closest enemy.

00:47:28.850 --> 00:47:31.041
So, once again, if
there were no enemies

00:47:31.041 --> 00:47:33.540
nearby we would either go to
the rallyPoint or goToLocation.

00:47:36.130 --> 00:47:38.460
But now, what we want
to do-- Oh, goodness,

00:47:38.460 --> 00:47:42.080
hey quit sending me
things on the-- Anyway.

00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:44.756
So now, what we'll do is we'll
just go straight to the enemy.

00:47:44.756 --> 00:47:45.630
That's what we'll do.

00:47:45.630 --> 00:47:47.780
If we see one,
we'll go kill them.

00:47:47.780 --> 00:47:50.430
So now, what we'll do
is we'll pit this code

00:47:50.430 --> 00:47:52.650
against the previous
version of this code

00:47:52.650 --> 00:47:53.950
and we'll see which one wins.

00:47:53.950 --> 00:47:56.100
It's an interesting question.

00:47:56.100 --> 00:47:59.220
Which code is better, to go
straight for the enemy base,

00:47:59.220 --> 00:48:01.300
or to go for the
closest enemy robot?

00:48:01.300 --> 00:48:03.020
Because maybe on
their way to the base,

00:48:03.020 --> 00:48:05.317
I mean everybody shoots
on the way to everywhere,

00:48:05.317 --> 00:48:06.400
but what's the best thing?

00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:08.230
I'm think it'll be
quite interesting.

00:48:08.230 --> 00:48:09.580
So let's see, where do we shoot?

00:48:09.580 --> 00:48:10.080
It's here.

00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:11.880
So, now we can go
to the location.

00:48:11.880 --> 00:48:13.900
And we can go to
the closest enemy.

00:48:13.900 --> 00:48:18.490
Yeah, because there's guaranteed
to be an enemy to go to.

00:48:18.490 --> 00:48:19.220
Oh bother.

00:48:19.220 --> 00:48:20.595
It's another one
of these things.

00:48:20.595 --> 00:48:22.800
No, wait that's there,
goToLocation, closestEnemy.

00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:24.300
Oh, right I've got
to initialize it.

00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:25.590
Yes, so I put null.

00:48:25.590 --> 00:48:28.270
It'll never see null, but I've
got to put it there anyway

00:48:28.270 --> 00:48:29.740
so that it's comforted.

00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:32.100
I believe that's the technical
explanation for what's

00:48:32.100 --> 00:48:36.370
going on in the
background of Eclipse.

00:48:36.370 --> 00:48:37.710
I'm pretty sure.

00:48:37.710 --> 00:48:38.670
So now let's run.

00:48:38.670 --> 00:48:40.960
Oh man, this is getting
exciting, it's 5:55.

00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:44.170
I guess I'll have
some closing remarks.

00:48:44.170 --> 00:48:46.390
But this'll be the
thing that is supposed

00:48:46.390 --> 00:48:47.770
to be exciting and amazing.

00:48:47.770 --> 00:48:49.930
We'll have awesome
versus awesomer.

00:48:49.930 --> 00:48:55.600
All right, these guys are
so, they have a lot of fun.

00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:56.570
That's so important.

00:48:56.570 --> 00:48:58.210
I didn't say that again.

00:48:58.210 --> 00:49:01.420
All right so, raise your hand
if you think that Awesome Robot

00:49:01.420 --> 00:49:05.510
player, the original
awesome is going to win.

00:49:05.510 --> 00:49:06.800
Three hands.

00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:11.000
How many people think that
Awesomer Robot is going to win?

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:13.600
Four hands.

00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:16.960
OK, well, I recognize
that premature arthritis

00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:18.580
can be caused by coding.

00:49:18.580 --> 00:49:21.230
Raising an arm may
be beyond some of us,

00:49:21.230 --> 00:49:25.300
in terms of, oh, ohh.

00:49:25.300 --> 00:49:26.850
OK, we're going to find out.

00:49:26.850 --> 00:49:28.920
OK, I actually don't
know the answer.

00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:31.590
OK, so they're just grouping.

00:49:31.590 --> 00:49:34.130
It's round 70, round
80, it's round 100.

00:49:34.130 --> 00:49:36.239
At round 200, exciting
stuff's going to happen.

00:49:36.239 --> 00:49:37.530
I wish we could slow this down.

00:49:37.530 --> 00:49:38.905
It's going to
happen all at once.

00:49:38.905 --> 00:49:39.500
Boom.

00:49:39.500 --> 00:49:40.880
Ah.

00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:42.550
Oh, but they stopped them.

00:49:42.550 --> 00:49:44.420
They stopped them.

00:49:44.420 --> 00:49:47.500
The Awesomer player
has won, hurray.

00:49:47.500 --> 00:49:48.570
Did you see that?

00:49:48.570 --> 00:49:50.360
It was all too fast.

00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:53.420
It just went by before, I mean
before I even noticed it was,

00:49:53.420 --> 00:49:55.140
ah goodness gracious.

00:49:55.140 --> 00:49:56.510
So, here it goes.

00:49:56.510 --> 00:49:58.400
These guys will run
back to the base,

00:49:58.400 --> 00:50:00.970
but these guys will be following
them the whole way through.

00:50:00.970 --> 00:50:03.260
OK, so let's back
it up a little bit.

00:50:03.260 --> 00:50:04.495
This is interesting.

00:50:04.495 --> 00:50:08.490
Now, I think if you
push like f, or b, or c,

00:50:08.490 --> 00:50:11.480
you can turn off the
circles, maybe not.

00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:15.440
OK, so they're
forming a concave.

00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:17.334
Oh man, a lot of
them are blowing up.

00:50:17.334 --> 00:50:18.750
It's hard to tell
what's going on.

00:50:18.750 --> 00:50:21.774
OK, so here it looks pretty
darn even, 1,2,3, 4,5,6,

00:50:21.774 --> 00:50:27.510
7,8,9 versus 1, I can't
tell if he's dying,

00:50:27.510 --> 00:50:30.650
2,3,4, 5,6,7, 8,9,10.

00:50:30.650 --> 00:50:32.390
OK, so it's 10 versus 9.

00:50:32.390 --> 00:50:35.205
The blue guys have done
well, pretty well already.

00:50:35.205 --> 00:50:37.470
Oh, but then they
just ping, they just

00:50:37.470 --> 00:50:39.190
ping and turn around
and kill everything.

00:50:39.190 --> 00:50:41.280
I've got to step
forward more slowly.

00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:43.635
This is a fast-paced
game, let me tell you.

00:50:43.635 --> 00:50:45.010
Let me tell you,
you're not going

00:50:45.010 --> 00:50:47.440
to be here for an hour
watching somebody--

00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:47.940
Oh man.

00:50:47.940 --> 00:50:50.060
OK, so these guys are
all working over there.

00:50:50.060 --> 00:50:51.180
Oh, look at that.

00:50:51.180 --> 00:50:53.870
Meanwhile, these
guys are ganging up

00:50:53.870 --> 00:50:58.310
on him and these three guys are
getting totally double-teamed,

00:50:58.310 --> 00:51:00.950
or quadruple-teamed, or whatever
the word is, by these fellows.

00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:04.351
Oh, I'm pointing with my
finger, how can you see that?

00:51:04.351 --> 00:51:05.915
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:51:05.915 --> 00:51:07.040
PROFESSOR: Oh, my goodness.

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:12.567
Look I'm enjoying myself OK.

00:51:12.567 --> 00:51:14.900
Yeah, and then they turn
around and they kill the enemy,

00:51:14.900 --> 00:51:17.191
and then they turn around
and they kill the enemy base.

00:51:17.191 --> 00:51:18.980
There you have it, boom, done.

00:51:18.980 --> 00:51:21.470
All right so, final
closing remarks.

00:51:25.740 --> 00:51:28.120
I'm looking at the wrong page.

00:51:28.120 --> 00:51:32.250
Yeah, so improvements
to this robot,

00:51:32.250 --> 00:51:35.280
there's lots of things that you
could do, that you would do,

00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:37.340
that are worth doing.

00:51:37.340 --> 00:51:39.830
For example, everybody's
making decisions independently,

00:51:39.830 --> 00:51:41.640
you could be using messaging.

00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:44.900
I think this is a big point
because somebody asked me

00:51:44.900 --> 00:51:48.270
the other day, what is
the point of messaging.

00:51:48.270 --> 00:51:50.150
Because all of my
robots have access

00:51:50.150 --> 00:51:52.130
to all of my other robots' data.

00:51:52.130 --> 00:51:53.710
And you saw that happen here.

00:51:53.710 --> 00:51:55.350
Because would these
guys have been

00:51:55.350 --> 00:51:57.990
able to respond intelligently?

00:51:57.990 --> 00:52:00.590
Would this guy have come--
Gosh, I'm using my finger

00:52:00.590 --> 00:52:05.290
again-- would these fellows be
able to come all the way back?

00:52:05.290 --> 00:52:08.827
I agree Steven, I should
close GChat when presenting.

00:52:08.827 --> 00:52:11.160
Would these guys have been
able to come all the way back

00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:13.781
to here if they didn't
have shared data?

00:52:13.781 --> 00:52:14.530
No, they wouldn't.

00:52:14.530 --> 00:52:17.530
So, they have shared data, why
would you ever use messaging?

00:52:17.530 --> 00:52:21.400
Because you could simplify it
by having your headquarters do

00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:23.150
the processing,
and say, all right,

00:52:23.150 --> 00:52:25.220
I want everybody
to attack this guy.

00:52:25.220 --> 00:52:27.775
And then they all just go
ahead and follow that command,

00:52:27.775 --> 00:52:29.900
rather than having to do
the processing themselves.

00:52:29.900 --> 00:52:31.524
Because if everybody
has the same data,

00:52:31.524 --> 00:52:34.170
why should everybody
process on the same data?

00:52:34.170 --> 00:52:35.920
So, there you go
that is a reason,

00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:37.865
it doesn't prove that
it's always better,

00:52:37.865 --> 00:52:40.490
because it may be much better to
have a decentralized approach,

00:52:40.490 --> 00:52:41.124
and so on.

00:52:41.124 --> 00:52:43.040
There are very many
reasons, but there you go,

00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:44.456
that's an answer
to that question.

00:52:44.456 --> 00:52:45.990
You saw Awesome,
you saw Awesomer,

00:52:45.990 --> 00:52:47.580
and you saw it right here.

00:52:47.580 --> 00:52:48.680
Thank you for coming.

00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:52.240
The next-- Just remain
calm in your seats

00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:53.380
and there will be food.

00:52:53.380 --> 00:52:55.380
The food guy probably
arrive already, I'm sorry,

00:52:55.380 --> 00:52:57.596
yesterday I thought the
food guy hadn't arrived.

00:52:57.596 --> 00:52:59.220
They don't mind being
called food guys,

00:52:59.220 --> 00:53:00.894
don't worry it's not insulting.

00:53:00.894 --> 00:53:02.310
I thought he hadn't
arrived, but I

00:53:02.310 --> 00:53:04.809
think he was poking is head in
and out like a drinking bird,

00:53:04.809 --> 00:53:08.810
and I just didn't see it because
of various myopia and such, no,

00:53:08.810 --> 00:53:10.310
what do they call
it, tunnel vision.

00:53:10.310 --> 00:53:12.890
So, yes, the next lecture.

00:53:12.890 --> 00:53:14.450
I'm sure you enjoyed
this one a lot,

00:53:14.450 --> 00:53:16.570
even if you know Java already.

00:53:16.570 --> 00:53:18.929
Because you could see
the warmth and the smiles

00:53:18.929 --> 00:53:21.220
on the faces of the people
who didn't know Java and now

00:53:21.220 --> 00:53:24.110
do because of this
amazing whirlwind tour.

00:53:24.110 --> 00:53:27.920
So, yes, the next lecture
will be on navigation,

00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:29.570
as if this one wasn't.

00:53:29.570 --> 00:53:32.120
Yeah, and you're going to hear
all kinds of amazing things

00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:33.495
that you never
would've expected.

00:53:33.495 --> 00:53:36.275
And you're going to see this
like awesome visualizer that's

00:53:36.275 --> 00:53:38.650
a little bit like the fractals
that I was showing before.

00:53:38.650 --> 00:53:42.040
It's made in Mathematica
and it's made in the USA.

00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:44.710
And yeah, hurray.

00:53:44.710 --> 00:53:45.752
So, thank you for coming.

00:53:45.752 --> 00:53:47.043
And this is the end of lecture.

00:53:47.043 --> 00:53:48.840
And I'll just be here
answering questions.

00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:50.380
Again, there's
lab after lecture.

00:53:50.380 --> 00:53:52.838
My god, this is like one of
those symphonies that you think

00:53:52.838 --> 00:53:54.490
keeps ending, but
it doesn't end.

00:53:54.490 --> 00:53:55.560
And that will be all.

00:53:55.560 --> 00:53:57.880
Thank you.

00:53:57.880 --> 00:53:59.430
AUDIENCE: [APPLAUSE]
