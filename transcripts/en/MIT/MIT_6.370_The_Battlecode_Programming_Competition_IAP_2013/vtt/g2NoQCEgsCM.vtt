00:00:28.462 --> 00:00:29.920
MAXWELL MANN: I'm
going to tell you

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.545
why I think that organization
of your code is the bee's knees.

00:00:33.545 --> 00:00:35.820
It's the coolest thing ever.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.600
If you organize your
code well, then you

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.450
can end up having not
a horrible player.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.040
I think lecture three robot
release is kind of long.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.710
I released some
code, and it's long.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:53.910
Look at all that stuff.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.460
It's especially large when
you want have 16 point font so

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.710
that everybody can see
from back at the end.

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.250
But it's just too
much, so here I'm

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.874
going to propose that you
organize your code into, as you

00:01:05.874 --> 00:01:08.770
can see here on the left,
many separate files.

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.110
So this is-- I think
it's [? Hitav's ?] code.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.290
He's one of the devs
this year, and you

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.840
can see here his robot player.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.210
He's got the package name,
and he imports some things,

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.710
and right after that, he defines
these new types, like base

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.450
player, headquarters
player, soldier player,

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:32.420
and encampment player.

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.790
And each of these things
is part of base player.

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.450
You can see here base player
is this public, abstract class

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.860
that he defines here.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.710
And it has certain things
he wants to use later.

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.810
And then later when
he has other players,

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.410
like an encampment
player, he can just

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:54.345
say, OK, I am going to call
this public class encampment

00:01:54.345 --> 00:01:56.260
player extends base player.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.370
And now, this guy has access
to all of this guy's method.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.040
And it's also located in
his own convenient place.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.990
So I'm going to post
some example that

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.047
shows how to get your code
separated in a convenient way

00:02:08.047 --> 00:02:09.380
if you haven't done that before.

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.790
So you've got your
code separated,

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.457
and you want to make life easy.

00:02:15.457 --> 00:02:17.040
You don't want to
code in a way that's

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.450
going to make it hard for you to
make changes and make updates.

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.570
Steven Arcangeli,
who won Battlecode

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.925
two or three years ago,
has posted on his blog

00:02:26.925 --> 00:02:30.670
a description of coding
best practices that

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.850
enabled him to really
do well in Battlecode.

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.020
He did things like
make sure that things

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.080
are in separate files,
that they have subpackages.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.340
And that he worked on
this framework code

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.070
most of the time.

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.110
He wasn't trying to just
mash out a strategy.

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.660
He was building systems
that he could reuse and use

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:50.910
multiple times.

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.040
He also made a rapid
iteration system

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.090
so he could test his code
against other ways of running

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.890
the same code.

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.130
And today, Aaron is
here with me to set up

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.720
a system for trading
code between us

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.780
so we can work more efficiently.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:11.330
So according to Stephen,
he was doing strategy only

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.090
in the last week
of the competition.

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.730
The rest of the time, he
was basically just writing

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.199
navigation code, or
something very basic,

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:21.240
and then he would sort of
figure out the strategy

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.730
after watching the tournaments,
like the sprint tournament

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:24.855
and the seeding tournament.

00:03:27.191 --> 00:03:28.940
AARON EPSTEIN: OK,
just steal the strategy

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.231
instead of writing it yourself.

00:03:30.231 --> 00:03:30.900
Awesome.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.240
MAXWELL MANN: Yeah, I guess
that's one way to do it.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.020
So I'm going to go ahead
and switch on over to Aaron,

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.680
and he's going to show
how he would set things up

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.080
to start sending me files
in the most efficient way.

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.700
AARON EPSTEIN: Hello, I'm Aaron,
the less effective lecturer,

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.520
and I'm going to tell you that
the most efficient way to share

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.660
files between me and Max is Git.

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:56.930
Spoiler alert, it's Git.

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:05.220
So I have my directory,
it's called user test,

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.830
but it's a Battlecode
installation, the same as you

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:09.330
guys have.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.280
I have some stuff in here
that I want to share with Max,

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.500
particularly something
in the team's directory.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.650
This awesome player--
awesomer player-- and I

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.490
want Max to have it.

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.610
So how do I get it to him?

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.330
So first, I made a
Bitbucket account.

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.110
It's free, it's
similar to GitHub,

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.800
except the problem with GitHub
is if you want a private repo,

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.180
you'd have to pay for it.

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.192
So you'd probably
abusing a public repo,

00:04:40.192 --> 00:04:42.400
which means anybody who can
guess your user name just

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.245
has access to all
your robots, which

00:04:44.245 --> 00:04:46.980
makes it even easier for them
to your code and strategies.

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:48.150
It's kind of silly.

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:53.470
Bitbucket gives you a private
repo with up to five users.

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.170
We only give you four users,
so a Bitbucket's perfect.

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:00.230
So you make your
Bitbucket account.

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:05.460
And then I want to make a repo
for Max and I to share code.

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:10.170
So I'm going to call
it Battlecode example.

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:12.650
I want it to be private
so that other teams can't

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:13.337
steal our stuff.

00:05:13.337 --> 00:05:14.920
It's going to be
Git, because that's I

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.050
all that I know how to use.

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.927
It's going to be Java.

00:05:18.927 --> 00:05:19.510
Now create it.

00:05:23.484 --> 00:05:25.150
MAXWELL MANN: So this
repository, Aaron,

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.342
is going to be on the
internet, and so we'll really

00:05:28.342 --> 00:05:29.800
be able to access
it from anywhere.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.900
It's sort of its own
backup system, isn't it?

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:34.570
AARON EPSTEIN: Yep.

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:36.670
It's backup, it's
version intelligent,

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:38.620
cross platform, et cetera.

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:39.799
It's perfect.

00:05:39.799 --> 00:05:40.590
MAXWELL MANN: Yeah.

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.720
Yesterday or the day
before, my computer

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.330
gave me a bunch of
Blue Screens of Death.

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:48.742
I think one of my memory
sectors is failing or something.

00:05:48.742 --> 00:05:50.950
But I wasn't that nervous,
because we have everything

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:53.010
stored online.

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:53.510
True story.

00:05:58.232 --> 00:05:59.190
AARON EPSTEIN: Alright.

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:03.380
So Bitbucket goes ahead and
gives me the instructions.

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:07.651
So I'm basically just going
to follow these instructions.

00:06:07.651 --> 00:06:09.900
I've already made the directory
and I'm already in it,

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:11.025
so I don't need to do this.

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:18.360
So right now the
installation's not a Git repo.

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.210
So I'm going to go
ahead and make it one.

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:24.190
Get in it, now it's empty.

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:27.420
And then it tells me to
add this thing as remote.

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:28.350
I'll do that later.

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:31.230
OK, so right now it's
an empty Git repository.

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:33.880
It's not very useful,
because it's empty.

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:38.325
If I use Git status, it tells
me that it's basically empty.

00:06:46.094 --> 00:06:48.260
Yeah, it tells me that
there's all these things that

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.520
are untracked.

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.380
It's not tracking anything.

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:53.634
And there's nothing in it.

00:06:53.634 --> 00:06:56.175
AUDIENCE: What does it mean when
they're tracked or untracked

00:06:56.175 --> 00:06:57.670
By Git?

00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:59.880
AARON EPSTEIN: So it said
when I initialized it here

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:01.450
that it was empty.

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:03.802
So even though there's a bunch
of things in this folder,

00:07:03.802 --> 00:07:05.760
Git doesn't really know
or care about them yet,

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:07.290
because I haven't told
them where they are,

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:08.460
or what it should
pay attention to

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:10.085
and what it shouldn't
pay attention to,

00:07:10.085 --> 00:07:11.180
so it's just empty.

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:13.310
That's why it's labeled
"everything untracked",

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:15.850
because they're not yet tracked.

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:18.710
So let me make some of
these things tracked.

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:20.840
And by some, I mean only
the awesomer player,

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:22.770
because that's the only thing
I want to give Max right now.

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:25.190
So I'm going to do Git add,
because I want to add it

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:26.864
to the list of things
that's tracked.

00:07:26.864 --> 00:07:28.280
And go team/awesomer
player/robot.

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:34.060
OK, cool.

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:35.070
Now it's added.

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:39.560
So now if I look at the
status, I have one new file.

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.780
I didn't make it, so
it's not new with respect

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:43.613
to the hard drive, but
it's new with respect

00:07:43.613 --> 00:07:46.180
to Git, because Git didn't
know about it before.

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:48.140
And then these are
still on track.

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:52.410
So now to share it with Max,
I have to commit this change.

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:54.770
Right now, it's just
been added, but it's

00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:57.730
sort of floating
around in space.

00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:01.490
So "commit" really solidifies
it into a block of changes

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:03.130
that I can give to max.

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:07.500
So "initial commit",
just because that's

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:10.700
the best practices name
for the first commit.

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:13.410
MAXWELL MANN: You see here
he's put a message with it,

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:15.240
so that when we look
at the commit logs,

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:17.260
we'll be able to see
his descriptions of what

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:21.470
went on for all the changes, all
the way back to the beginning.

00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:24.150
And we'll have all
these things posted

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:27.730
in the handy-dandy guide--
gosh, I said it again--

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:30.440
so you don't have to
worry about memorizing it.

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:33.750
Right now you just want to
get the overview of how we're

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:37.885
doing it, and how many
millions of times more awesome

00:08:37.885 --> 00:08:42.350
it is to do it this way,
than to email to one another.

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:45.210
AARON EPSTEIN: I should
mention hyphen a means "all",

00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:49.500
like for everything, and
m means give a message

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:51.740
here with strings
rather than having

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:54.620
to type it into an editor.

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:56.649
On Windows, if you
leave out the m switch,

00:08:56.649 --> 00:08:58.690
you get notepad, which is
not that big of a deal,

00:08:58.690 --> 00:08:59.980
because it's just notepad.

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:01.813
Just type it in and hit
Save, and it's okay,

00:09:01.813 --> 00:09:03.840
and you remember to use
the m switch next time.

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:07.760
But on Linux, if you forget
the m switch, most likely

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:11.750
it'll give you Vim, which is so
complicated and arcane that it

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:15.460
took me many times before I
even knew how to close it.

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:19.370
MAXWELL MANN: It's like
escape:wq or something.

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:20.390
It's absolutely crazy.

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:23.820
AARON EPSTEIN: I think I've
gathered that colon q quits it,

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:24.917
and colon w saves.

00:09:24.917 --> 00:09:26.500
MAXWELL MANN: I think
you have to push

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:28.140
s to start typing again.

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:30.154
It doesn't even let
you put commands in.

00:09:30.154 --> 00:09:31.570
AARON EPSTEIN: You
want to say out

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:33.914
of Vim if you're not initiated.

00:09:33.914 --> 00:09:34.789
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:40.660
AARON EPSTEIN: OK.

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:41.590
Got it.

00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:43.940
Well I just the m switch
so I can stay out of Vim,

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:46.930
because it's only
for the initiated.

00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:48.860
MAXWELL MANN: I
see one question.

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:51.070
AUDIENCE: So do you
guys recommend only

00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:52.980
sharing specific
files at a time,

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:54.560
instead of the entire project?

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:57.845
AARON EPSTEIN: Yes,
and I will discuss

00:09:57.845 --> 00:10:02.470
that eventually, but for now the
only things you want to share

00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:04.950
are things that you wrote
yourself and are changing

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:06.270
yourself.

00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:08.870
But I will discuss more
of that in the future.

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:11.970
So right now I just want to
share that one specific file.

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:18.090
So now it's committed.

00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:21.700
I need to get onto
here, so I do this thing

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:23.800
that it tells me to do.

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:25.810
Basically I'm going
to add as a remote,

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:27.050
like a thing that's not here.

00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:29.810
It's a remote, it's somewhere
else, so the server.

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:32.810
I'm going to add one called
"origin", because origin

00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:35.930
is the canonical name
for this sort of thing,

00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:37.310
and then I follow the URL.

00:10:43.469 --> 00:10:45.510
MAXWELL MANN: You can't
copy and paste into that?

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:46.414
AARON EPSTEIN: No.

00:10:46.414 --> 00:10:47.580
MAXWELL MANN: Oh, you can't?

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:48.430
AARON EPSTEIN: No.

00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:49.900
MAXWELL MANN: Oh, mine's better.

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:55.090
Right now, he's using MinGW
shell to type these commands.

00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:57.140
If you just put it in
Windows command prompt,

00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:59.640
I don't think it would work.

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:03.700
I'm going to use to Git
Bash, which you can get--

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:06.530
AARON EPSTEIN: No,
you're using Git Shell,

00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:08.400
which opens Windows PowerShell.

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:10.592
MAXWELL MANN: And you
can get that online just

00:11:10.592 --> 00:11:11.550
by Google searching it.

00:11:30.435 --> 00:11:32.060
AARON EPSTEIN: Cool,
well there you go.

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:35.730
That's how you remove remotes.

00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:36.872
Two birds, one stone.

00:11:36.872 --> 00:11:38.330
MAXWELL MANN: That's
pretty useful.

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:40.008
We did that on purpose.

00:11:40.008 --> 00:11:41.490
That guy's a plant.

00:11:44.454 --> 00:11:46.430
I'll pay you after lecture.

00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:50.386
AARON EPSTEIN: So to check what
I have, I do the hyphen v. You

00:11:50.386 --> 00:11:53.220
might be familiar with
a verbose, hyphen v.

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:55.770
So I have this, it
looks spelled correctly.

00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:57.390
Cool.

00:11:57.390 --> 00:12:01.240
Now I push to it, like take
my changes and push them,

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:04.845
to "origin", which is the
name I've given to this URL.

00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:11.920
"Master" is the master branch.

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:13.640
It's going to ask
me for my password,

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:16.280
because I haven't
configured SSH correctly,

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:18.530
but Bitbucket has
instructions for setting this

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:20.820
up so that your computers
recognize each other.

00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:22.903
You don't need to type in
the password every time.

00:12:22.903 --> 00:12:24.560
I just haven't done it yet.

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:29.540
OK, now it looks
like I successfully

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:31.610
wrote things to the server.

00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:33.890
So Max should be
able to get them.

00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:39.580
Oh, no, he shouldn't be able
to, because my repo is private,

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:41.710
and nobody's allowed
to access it but me.

00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:42.960
Let me change that.

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:49.885
Settings, access management.

00:12:49.885 --> 00:12:53.180
MAXWELL MANN: So I'm M4X Mann.

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:55.500
AARON EPSTEIN: And I want
to give him read and write,

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:57.125
but I don't trust
him to administer it.

00:13:00.492 --> 00:13:02.180
MAXWELL MANN: It's a good idea.

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:04.780
I have a certain
tendency of screwing up

00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:10.120
certain administration
jobs, this one not included.

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:12.450
So I'm going to go ahead
and switch on over to Me.

00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:15.650
Now I'm me.

00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:18.810
I wasn't before, but I am now.

00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:20.000
Let's make some space here.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.890
On the left, this
is where I have

00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:25.250
Battlecode installed,
on the desktop.

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:29.410
And I guess what I want to do
is I want to make this existing

00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:35.500
Battlecode directory the
main directory for the root

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:40.160
for my Github version of
the thing that he has.

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:41.730
Yeah, that's the technical term.

00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:46.110
So I'm going to go into it.

00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:48.100
So now I'm in this directory.

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:51.980
And what I'm going to do is
I'm going to initialize GIt

00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:54.620
so that now it knows that
I'm interested in using

00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:57.300
Git in this folder.

00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:04.290
And now that I'm in it,
I will do Git remote add.

00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:10.060
And I'll go onto
this website, I'm

00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:12.450
just going to hit refresh here.

00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:14.147
Is this it,
"Battlecode-example"?

00:14:14.147 --> 00:14:14.980
AARON EPSTEIN: Yeah.

00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:16.170
MAXWELL MANN: OK, so you
named it the same thing

00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:17.450
as you named the previous one?

00:14:17.450 --> 00:14:17.970
AARON EPSTEIN: Yep.

00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:18.910
MAXWELL MANN: OK.

00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:19.770
So I'm in here.

00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:21.560
And I can just right
click and hit Paste

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:24.470
because I have PowerShell.

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:26.780
So now I've now I've added it.

00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:29.780
And so I'll then follow
that up with a "git pull" .

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:41.690
And that's going to give me--
oh, it says it's not my--

00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:43.000
I need a name?

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.850
AARON EPSTEIN: Yeah.

00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:46.900
You didn't name it.

00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:51.107
Yeah, you just did Git remote
add, and you just put the URL.

00:14:51.107 --> 00:14:52.690
MAXWELL MANN: OK,
I'll name it origin.

00:14:52.690 --> 00:14:53.670
AARON EPSTEIN: No,
the other way around.

00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:55.030
MAXWELL MANN: OK.

00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:57.410
So I'll name it--
what do I name it?

00:14:57.410 --> 00:14:59.140
AARON EPSTEIN: Origin,
and then the URL.

00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:01.495
MAXWELL MANN: Add origin,
and then and then the URL.

00:15:01.495 --> 00:15:03.120
We'll have this all
written down so you

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:05.400
have the instructions in
front of you when you do it.

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:07.316
AARON EPSTEIN: Now you
should be able to pull.

00:15:07.316 --> 00:15:09.420
MAXWELL MANN: OK so
now I can Git pull.

00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:13.660
And this should get me the
stuff he wanted to give me.

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:15.225
Now it may end up
being a problem--

00:15:15.225 --> 00:15:17.100
AARON EPSTEIN: No, you've
got to specifically

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:19.100
from origin master.

00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:21.190
MAXWELL MANN: Ah, git
pull, origin master.

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:26.510
Yeah.

00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:28.864
For those of you who
know Git already,

00:15:28.864 --> 00:15:31.280
I think it may be giving you
trouble because I may already

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:33.260
have awesomer player.

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:38.010
so we're going to pretend
that I don't have it.

00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:40.220
Yeah, so let's go let's
go back to Eclipse.

00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:42.400
Oh, it's black.

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:45.440
What is that?

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:48.810
I think Eclipse.
is very unhappy.

00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:51.789
Have you ever had this?

00:15:51.789 --> 00:15:52.830
OK, where's the package--

00:15:56.646 --> 00:15:58.020
AARON EPSTEIN:
There are Windows,

00:15:58.020 --> 00:16:00.179
so we should probably just
restart both computers.

00:16:00.179 --> 00:16:01.720
MAXWELL MANN: Restart
both computers?

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:04.220
AARON EPSTEIN: Yeah, and every
Windows computer in the room.

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:05.265
MAXWELL MANN: Oh, right.

00:16:05.265 --> 00:16:06.890
Now let's see, which
is the button that

00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:08.480
gets me the package?

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:10.440
Package inspector window?

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:11.440
Open perspective?

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:14.770
Show view, OK.

00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:15.980
I've got.

00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:17.790
Hey look, it's not dead.

00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:20.980
So let's refresh it
and now it's updating.

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:23.150
You see it hasn't got
awesomer player there,

00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:25.835
so that when I do this.

00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:30.870
Yeah, that wrapped around.

00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:34.470
But now I've done this,
if I push that F5,

00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:35.760
is that going to-- No?

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:37.100
Did it not work?

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:39.630
It says here,
already up to date.

00:16:42.057 --> 00:16:42.890
I think we broke it.

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:48.010
What are we gonna do, Aaron?

00:16:48.010 --> 00:16:50.555
AARON EPSTEIN: I don't know.

00:16:50.555 --> 00:16:51.680
I don't know what happened.

00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:56.536
So you don't have awesomer?

00:16:56.536 --> 00:16:57.410
Do you have awesomer?

00:16:57.410 --> 00:16:58.784
MAXWELL MANN: I
may have awesomer

00:16:58.784 --> 00:17:00.190
without knowing I have awesomer.

00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:02.805
I'm that awesome.

00:17:02.805 --> 00:17:05.339
Nope, there's nothing in there.

00:17:05.339 --> 00:17:07.819
Should we kill everything
and start over?

00:17:07.819 --> 00:17:09.030
AARON EPSTEIN: Yep.

00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:11.560
MAXWELL MANN: Right.

00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:12.554
Doing it the right way.

00:17:12.554 --> 00:17:13.470
You saw it here first.

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:20.810
AARON EPSTEIN: OK, so
Bitbucket tells me--

00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:22.839
MAXWELL MANN: OK,
I've got an idea.

00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:24.960
Make a new package
and send that one.

00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:30.660
Something else.

00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:32.400
Something different.

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:36.860
OK, let's go back
to Aaron's computer.

00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:39.027
So you made a a super thing?

00:17:39.027 --> 00:17:40.610
AARON EPSTEIN: A
super awesome player.

00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:42.510
MAXWELL MANN: A
super awesome player.

00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:45.390
Oh my goodness.

00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:49.300
So now you're pushing
that onto the master,

00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:52.941
and then once that's done, I'm
going to go back to me, right?

00:17:52.941 --> 00:17:53.440
OK.

00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:02.350
SO I'm going back to
my Battlecode folder.

00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:02.850
OK.

00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:05.060
And now it's already
got Git in it.

00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:06.220
I'm already good to go.

00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:09.850
I've set up the remote by
doing Git, remote, add,

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:12.826
origin and then
the HTTPS URL that

00:18:12.826 --> 00:18:14.450
was available on the
Bitbucket website.

00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:15.870
AARON EPSTEIN: Well, why
don't you Git status.

00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:16.589
Just to check.

00:18:16.589 --> 00:18:17.880
MAXWELL MANN: I like that idea.

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:20.230
OK, so I deleted a thing.

00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:24.122
Maybe if I just push the fact
that I deleted that thing.

00:18:24.122 --> 00:18:26.080
AARON EPSTEIN: Yeah,
maybe that was a bad idea.

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:27.621
MAXWELL MANN: Well
in any case, we're

00:18:27.621 --> 00:18:30.080
going to see what happens.

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:32.640
Maybe if I add, so that
it's tracking the thing that

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:36.520
isn't there, then
that'll improve matters.

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:41.235
AARON EPSTEIN: Let me
just make the reaper.

00:18:41.235 --> 00:18:43.401
Oh no, but then you'd have
to type in the URL again.

00:18:43.401 --> 00:18:46.890
MAXWELL MANN: Yeah, I could just
paste, but let's do Git pull.

00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:51.650
And let's see if
it works, shall we?

00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:53.979
AARON EPSTEIN: Nothing to lose.

00:18:53.979 --> 00:18:55.270
MAXWELL MANN: Only our dignity.

00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:56.940
AARON EPSTEIN: I'm going to
pull from the origin master

00:18:56.940 --> 00:18:57.481
specifically.

00:18:57.481 --> 00:19:00.890
MAXWELL MANN: Well, what happens
if I just do it as it is?

00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:01.860
It's no good?

00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:02.700
AARON EPSTEIN: You've
got to configure it

00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:03.410
before you do that.

00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:05.118
MAXWELL MANN: It said,
unpacking objects.

00:19:05.118 --> 00:19:06.770
I think it did things.

00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:09.240
AARON EPSTEIN: Well it
unpacked a bunch of objects,

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:11.190
but it didn't know where
to put them, I think.

00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:12.060
MAXWELL MANN: It didn't
know where to put them.

00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:13.351
Well, I put them somewhere now.

00:19:13.351 --> 00:19:15.300
It says, one file changed.

00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:15.800
It's fussy?

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:16.990
I'm fussy.

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:20.000
We work together.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:20.500
OK.

00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:21.950
Now the thing is there.

00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:24.950
And if we wait 10 minutes,
Eclipse will start.

00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:27.687
But while I'm doing
that, you could

00:19:27.687 --> 00:19:28.770
talk about the next thing.

00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:35.490
Yay, there it is.

00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:37.100
Super awesome.

00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:38.240
Yeah, that's pretty cool.

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:38.920
AARON EPSTEIN: You
should watch it.

00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:39.160
It's super good.

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:40.780
MAXWELL MANN: I
should to watch it?

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:42.130
Is it the same as the other one?

00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:43.190
AARON EPSTEIN: No, it's mine.

00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:43.840
It's my special one.

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:45.180
MAXWELL MANN: Oh,
it's your special one?

00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:47.160
Oh my goodness, you guys
are in for real treat.

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:51.690
Aaron is a coding
beast, I gotta tell you.

00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:54.820
This is the representation of
his might and his capability,

00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:56.250
right here.

00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:58.725
Super awesome is the
red fellow and there he

00:19:58.725 --> 00:20:02.903
is, going, capturing
things, defusing mines.

00:20:02.903 --> 00:20:07.974
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:07.974 --> 00:20:09.390
AARON EPSTEIN: Oh,
it didn't work.

00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:10.819
Oh well.

00:20:10.819 --> 00:20:11.944
MAXWELL MANN: Sorry, Aaron.

00:20:11.944 --> 00:20:13.322
Next time.

00:20:13.322 --> 00:20:14.863
AARON EPSTEIN: It's
just a small map.

00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:24.605
So you could rush, strategy,
rush OP, et cetera.

00:20:24.605 --> 00:20:25.980
MAXWELL MANN: I'll
tell you what,

00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:27.860
we'll change the game specs.

00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:29.220
We'll change the game engine.

00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:31.215
AARON EPSTEIN: I've
already done it.

00:20:31.215 --> 00:20:32.090
MAXWELL MANN: Oh, OK.

00:20:32.090 --> 00:20:33.750
That makes sense.

00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:36.500
I just didn't get
the latest version.

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:38.300
The "Aaron wins all
matches" version.

00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:40.430
AARON EPSTEIN: Yep.

00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:43.059
OK, anyway-- What?

00:20:43.059 --> 00:20:45.350
AUDIENCE: Why don't you change
your team name to Aaron?

00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:49.690
AARON EPSTEIN: From what?

00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:50.830
What do you mean?

00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:53.754
Sorry, I don't understand.

00:20:53.754 --> 00:20:54.670
MAXWELL MANN: It's OK.

00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:57.671
It's got to do with corruption.

00:20:57.671 --> 00:20:58.670
I'll teach you sometime.

00:20:58.670 --> 00:20:59.970
AARON EPSTEIN: OK.

00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:01.950
Yeah, I don't know
anything about, of course.

00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:10.580
So I did Git status, which
is always a good thing to do.

00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:14.380
Between every command
that you execute,

00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:17.170
that you ask Git to do,
before you should do a status,

00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:18.640
and after you
should do a status.

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:21.895
Which means that since I wanted
to execute status to show you,

00:21:21.895 --> 00:21:24.320
I should have done Git
status three times.

00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:26.310
One before the Git
status, one to execute

00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:28.520
the Git status, and one after.

00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:30.830
Just so that you get
a really good feeling

00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:33.149
for what the status is.

00:21:33.149 --> 00:21:35.190
And you should actually
read it a bunch of times.

00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:37.040
So Git status, that's
the command I type.

00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:39.590
On branch master,
master's a branch.

00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:40.090
Got it.

00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:41.881
MAXWELL MANN: We'll do
branches in the lab.

00:21:41.881 --> 00:21:42.860
AARON EPSTEIN: Yeah.

00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:44.080
Untracked files.

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:46.280
OK, that's a lot
of untracked files.

00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:48.640
Nothing added to commit,
but untracked files present.

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:51.360
OK, nothing added to commit,
means I haven't done anything.

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:52.600
But there's untracked files.

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:53.100
That's bad.

00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:58.320
When I tell you status is
really important, I mean it.

00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:01.110
But if all this red stuff comes
up every time you type status,

00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:03.510
you're going to start not
paying attention to it.

00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:05.340
So an important thing
to do is to tell

00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:08.600
Git to ignore these things
that I never want to add.

00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:11.270
So I just want
them to be ignored.

00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:18.960
So what I do is I open up my
favorite text editor eMags,

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:25.870
and I go to
directory, and I make

00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:28.330
a file called dot Git ignore.

00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:33.540
And I no longer exist.

00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:34.040
OK.

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:42.729
Oh man, eMags is too
clever sometimes.

00:22:42.729 --> 00:22:45.145
MAXWELL MANN: Because he made
this file before the lecture

00:22:45.145 --> 00:22:47.211
in preparation, and
then deleted it.

00:22:47.211 --> 00:22:48.710
But eMags was like,
are you sure you

00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:51.050
didn't want to not have
the things you deleted

00:22:51.050 --> 00:22:53.570
and then looked for later
in a different place?

00:22:53.570 --> 00:22:54.660
And then he said, yes.

00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:55.080
AARON EPSTEIN: Now it's empty.

00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:55.810
OK, cool.

00:22:55.810 --> 00:22:57.850
So I have this empty
file, and to make it

00:22:57.850 --> 00:23:00.650
ignore this dot installation
information, which I'm never

00:23:00.650 --> 00:23:02.450
going to add to the
repo, I just type

00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:06.090
in dot installation information.

00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:07.640
And then to make it
ignore everything

00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:08.830
in the doc folder,
because I'm never

00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:10.996
going to have to share that
with Max, because he has

00:23:10.996 --> 00:23:12.820
from the installer,
do doc slash star,

00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:16.180
and then version
dot text, et cetera.

00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:20.380
Or I get this handy-dandy one
that I've already written,

00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:21.880
and just copy all of it.

00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:30.060
Yeah.

00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:36.500
So now that I've made the
dot Git ignore and saved it,

00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:39.210
now the only untracked
things are the other teams.

00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:43.330
So I could
specifically add those.

00:23:43.330 --> 00:23:50.230
Teams slash example,
teams slash macro player,

00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:54.630
team slash suicide player.

00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:57.090
MAXWELL MANN: Yet another
one of his classics.

00:23:57.090 --> 00:24:00.680
AARON EPSTEIN: Yeah, right.

00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:03.840
Save that, Git status.

00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:09.960
The thing with the squiggly
is just another eMags Folder.

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:12.085
I'll just ignore everything
that ends in squiggles.

00:24:14.637 --> 00:24:16.470
Cool, so now the only
thing that's untracked

00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:18.750
is a dot Git ignore.

00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:22.120
So I'll just add
the dot Git ignore.

00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:24.370
Because I do want to share
that with Max so he doesn't

00:24:24.370 --> 00:24:26.495
to go through all that
trouble I just went through.

00:24:26.495 --> 00:24:30.420
Now if I do status I get
this really nice-- oh, no.

00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:33.930
Now to commit the fact that
I've added the Git ignore.

00:24:33.930 --> 00:24:35.160
I do the AM switch again.

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:37.470
A for everything in the index.

00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:40.860
And m for not bringing up
VIM and pulling my hair out.

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:51.820
Make a nice commit message so
Max knows what this file's for.

00:24:56.120 --> 00:25:03.025
OK, now if I do status I get
this really clean status.

00:25:03.025 --> 00:25:06.170
It even says that my working
directory's clean, nothing

00:25:06.170 --> 00:25:06.960
to commit.

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:08.090
Perfect.

00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:11.870
So I'll push that to Max and
he can get it, if he wants.

00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:18.300
Type my password again, 123ABCD.

00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:27.355
MAXWELL MANN: So I noticed that
we untracked a bunch of things

00:25:27.355 --> 00:25:28.980
because we didn't
want to include them.

00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:31.590
But I was saying before this
that it might be convenient

00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:35.130
for us to just share
the whole of everything.

00:25:35.130 --> 00:25:36.960
Why wouldn't we do that?

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:40.070
AARON EPSTEIN: OK, there's a
lot of reasons not to do it.

00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:43.640
A couple things you don't
want in your Git repo.

00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:46.050
Anything that's
platform specific,

00:25:46.050 --> 00:25:48.120
probably you don't
want in your Git repo.

00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:51.050
So right now I'm using Windows
and Max is using Windows,

00:25:51.050 --> 00:25:53.910
but Steven doesn't use Windows.

00:25:53.910 --> 00:25:56.560
So anything that's
on our team-- if I

00:25:56.560 --> 00:26:00.374
have a path that
is something like C

00:26:00.374 --> 00:26:04.410
backslash users, that's going to
look like nonsense once Stephen

00:26:04.410 --> 00:26:05.190
checks it out.

00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:09.080
So anything platform specific
doesn't go in the repo.

00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:10.770
Another thing you
don't want in the repo

00:26:10.770 --> 00:26:14.250
is stuff that we distribute.

00:26:14.250 --> 00:26:16.064
By we, I mean we as
Battlecode people,

00:26:16.064 --> 00:26:17.480
not we as in this
false Battlecode

00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:18.860
team that has the repo.

00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:21.370
So we as Battlecode people
release an installer

00:26:21.370 --> 00:26:23.820
that gives you things like
example [? flux ?] player,

00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:27.130
and documents, and
stuff like that.

00:26:27.130 --> 00:26:30.580
You don't want those in
the repo because, let's say

00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:32.640
I add example [? flux ?]
player to the repo.

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:35.690
I check it in-- now, this
is I as in this guy--

00:26:35.690 --> 00:26:37.550
I check in example
[? flux ?] player.

00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:40.550
Max is working on really
complex navigation code.

00:26:40.550 --> 00:26:43.557
I have version 1.3, and
Max has version 1.0.

00:26:43.557 --> 00:26:45.890
An example [? flux ?] player,
the one I just checked in,

00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:48.000
makes a 1.3 specific
function call

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.940
that breaks if
you use it in 1.0.

00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:52.010
So I check it in, I upload it.

00:26:52.010 --> 00:26:55.320
Max downloads my code expecting
to get some more navigation

00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:56.450
stuff that he really needs.

00:26:56.450 --> 00:26:58.741
But he also gets this new
version of example [? flux ?]

00:26:58.741 --> 00:27:02.130
player that makes a 1.3
specific function call,

00:27:02.130 --> 00:27:04.810
and now his code
won't compile at all.

00:27:04.810 --> 00:27:06.810
And now he has to
interrupt the workflow

00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:09.820
that he was really
deep into navigation,

00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:12.730
and isolate where is
this red X coming from,

00:27:12.730 --> 00:27:15.550
and find out that it's because
it was in a different version.

00:27:15.550 --> 00:27:17.860
Then he has to go download
it from Battlecode.org,

00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:21.287
and then install it again,
and then update, and then

00:27:21.287 --> 00:27:23.370
find that the update doesn't
work on his computer.

00:27:23.370 --> 00:27:24.530
Then he has to fix that.

00:27:24.530 --> 00:27:26.520
All of this, and then in the
process, forgetting everything

00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:27.490
he knew about navigation.

00:27:27.490 --> 00:27:29.365
So when he gets back
to, he's already forgot.

00:27:29.365 --> 00:27:30.340
It's just a pain.

00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:33.270
So anything that we update,
just get it from the installer.

00:27:33.270 --> 00:27:35.070
Don't put in the repo.

00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:37.160
There's no need.

00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:42.040
Anything binary, don't
put that in the repo,

00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:43.650
because it's inefficient.

00:27:43.650 --> 00:27:47.650
Git has really good algorithms
for compressing and storing

00:27:47.650 --> 00:27:49.770
only meaningful
things about text,

00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:52.670
so if there's a huge
one megabyte text file

00:27:52.670 --> 00:27:55.780
and I change one line,
Git stores one line.

00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:58.350
None of those algorithms that
it has applied to binaries.

00:27:58.350 --> 00:28:02.730
So if I upload a binary, and I
change one line in a binary--

00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:05.840
a binary meaning a zip
archive or a picture.

00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:08.110
If I change one
pixel in the image,

00:28:08.110 --> 00:28:10.000
Git just has to
store both copies

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.160
of the image, which
is inefficient.

00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:14.820
So if you store our
whole installer,

00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:16.040
it's like 30 megabytes.

00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:18.560
Every time we update, you'll
add another 30 megabytes.

00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:22.180
So instead of this 500 kilobyte
repo that Max and I have right

00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:25.210
now, if you kept going like
30 megabytes per installer,

00:28:25.210 --> 00:28:26.790
you'd end up with 500 megabytes.

00:28:26.790 --> 00:28:27.750
Bad.

00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:28.810
Not good.

00:28:28.810 --> 00:28:31.050
And then, anything
that's personal,

00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:34.310
like project settings
you don't need them.

00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:36.480
So what do you put in the repo?

00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:38.340
Text documents that
you've created,

00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:42.990
like source code, or new maps
that you want, or a script.

00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:45.540
Or all the incredible
documentation

00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:48.250
that you're going to have
for your players, all

00:28:48.250 --> 00:28:51.920
of that, that can
go in the repo.

00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:52.421
Cool.

00:28:52.421 --> 00:28:53.795
MAXWELL MANN: In
some past years,

00:28:53.795 --> 00:28:55.520
we've offered another
one of these side

00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:58.080
prizes for best documented code.

00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:00.300
Are we going to be doing
that this year, Stephen?

00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:02.810
Think a best documented
code side prize this year?

00:29:02.810 --> 00:29:03.654
AUDIENCE: Probably

00:29:03.654 --> 00:29:04.920
MAXWELL MANN: Probably.

00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:06.080
Something to keep in mind.

00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:09.180
Keep those forward
slashes on your left ring

00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:12.070
finger, which is to say, ready.

00:29:15.230 --> 00:29:17.090
Do you hit it with
your pinky finger?

00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:19.550
AARON EPSTEIN: Mine is
on the left bracket,

00:29:19.550 --> 00:29:20.620
because I use Dvorak.

00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:21.470
MAXWELL MANN: Right.

00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:22.899
But it's still the same finger.

00:29:22.899 --> 00:29:24.315
AARON EPSTEIN: No,
it's the pinky.

00:29:24.315 --> 00:29:26.799
How do you go all the way over
there with the ring finger?

00:29:26.799 --> 00:29:28.340
MAXWELL MANN: I
think I was mistaken.

00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:30.506
AARON EPSTEIN: I think--
yes, it is the same finger.

00:29:30.506 --> 00:29:32.960
Yeah, pinky.

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:35.360
Pinky active coding.

00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:36.110
Cool.

00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:40.570
So then we just showed you an
example where I made a repo

00:29:40.570 --> 00:29:42.710
and put some files in
it and push to server.

00:29:42.710 --> 00:29:45.560
Max made his own repo,
pulled some stuff.

00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:46.310
He got it.

00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:47.400
He could do the
same thing, where

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:49.441
he can add files and push
it, and I can get them.

00:29:49.441 --> 00:29:50.540
And that's great.

00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:54.120
But now we have to show you what
happens if Max and I both try

00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:58.780
and change one thing,
the same thing.

00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:00.290
Then we get a conflict.

00:30:00.290 --> 00:30:03.100
It's really scary,
and the reason why--

00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:05.570
or, it's a reason that
some people give up on Git.

00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:07.790
But we're going to navigate it.

00:30:07.790 --> 00:30:09.600
It's going to be OK.

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:11.132
MAXWELL MANN: OK, let's do this.

00:30:13.644 --> 00:30:16.060
AARON EPSTEIN: OK, so let's
go to my super awesome player.

00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:24.760
I have this number
capturing channel here.

00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:26.469
I think it's not big enough.

00:30:26.469 --> 00:30:28.010
So I think you should
make it bigger.

00:30:28.010 --> 00:30:29.870
MAXWELL MANN: Well, I think
it's not well commented enough.

00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:32.060
AARON EPSTEIN: OK,
I'll make it bigger,

00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:33.214
but you try and explain it.

00:30:33.214 --> 00:30:35.380
Which is silly because you
don't know what it's for.

00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:37.796
But I'll make it bigger, because
I think that's important.

00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:43.511
It's a radio channel, so
in case you didn't get it,

00:30:43.511 --> 00:30:45.510
making it bigger's not
going to change anything.

00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:47.400
But anyway, I'll pretend.

00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:49.210
MAXWELL MANN: Okay,
I've saved my changes.

00:30:49.210 --> 00:30:51.210
AARON EPSTEIN: OK so I
did a status, because I'm

00:30:51.210 --> 00:30:52.260
about to execute commit.

00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:53.580
So first I did a status.

00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:57.400
Yeah, you're getting
the hang of this?

00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:59.455
Now I'm going to do a
commit, because modified,

00:30:59.455 --> 00:31:00.330
that's what I wanted.

00:31:00.330 --> 00:31:02.950
I wanted this player modified.

00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:03.700
Do a nice commit.

00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:10.980
OK.

00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:12.840
I would use an
exclamation mark here,

00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:15.690
but no exclamation marks
in Git commit messages

00:31:15.690 --> 00:31:17.900
because bash handles
them correctly.

00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:20.099
So they can't have
exclamation marks in them.

00:31:20.099 --> 00:31:22.390
MAXWELL MANN: Alright, I've
pushed my excellent change.

00:31:22.390 --> 00:31:26.150
I hope you learned
something from it.

00:31:26.150 --> 00:31:28.570
If I may say so, it's
a wonderful comment.

00:31:28.570 --> 00:31:34.550
I think that you really
couldn't expect much better.

00:31:34.550 --> 00:31:37.250
AARON EPSTEIN: Alright, I'm also
pushing my change, but wait.

00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:38.050
It didn't work.

00:31:38.050 --> 00:31:39.020
Why?

00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:41.497
Updates were rejected
because the tip of the branch

00:31:41.497 --> 00:31:45.310
is behind remote
counterpart pull.

00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:48.760
OK, I think what that means
is that because Max pushed

00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:52.246
and I tried to push
to the same place,

00:31:52.246 --> 00:31:53.920
Git doesn't like
that because then it

00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:55.795
wouldn't know which is
mostly recent version.

00:31:55.795 --> 00:31:57.739
So it tells to
resolve it by pull.

00:31:57.739 --> 00:31:59.530
A lot of commands, when
they give an error,

00:31:59.530 --> 00:32:01.730
will tell you what
command to fix it with.

00:32:01.730 --> 00:32:03.680
So because I'm
about to do a pull,

00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:06.520
first I'm going to do a status.

00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:08.744
OK, that's cool.

00:32:08.744 --> 00:32:09.660
And I'm going to pull.

00:32:12.191 --> 00:32:12.690
123ABCDE.

00:32:19.270 --> 00:32:20.480
Oh no.

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:21.730
Conflict.

00:32:21.730 --> 00:32:23.030
Look at that, all caps.

00:32:23.030 --> 00:32:24.620
Automatic merge
failed, fix conflicts

00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:27.770
and commit the result.

00:32:27.770 --> 00:32:32.204
So team super awesome robot
player dot java had a conflict.

00:32:32.204 --> 00:32:34.120
MAXWELL MANN: So Aaron,
I guess it's up to you

00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:35.380
now to fix that conflict.

00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:36.910
AARON EPSTEIN: Yeah, it is.

00:32:36.910 --> 00:32:39.474
So I go to robot
player dot Java.

00:32:39.474 --> 00:32:41.890
MAXWELL MANN: Oh man, why don't
you do window preferences,

00:32:41.890 --> 00:32:43.730
and change your size
to something non-zero.

00:32:45.966 --> 00:32:47.340
AARON EPSTEIN: Aw
man, but I'm so

00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:50.315
excited about
fixing the conflict.

00:32:50.315 --> 00:32:51.940
I just want to fix
the conflict though.

00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:52.900
Is this going to
fix the conflict?

00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:54.070
MAXWELL MANN: Appearance.

00:32:54.070 --> 00:32:56.445
Some conflicts have been going
on for thousands of years,

00:32:56.445 --> 00:32:58.550
I think it can wait.

00:32:58.550 --> 00:33:01.330
Yeah, then you go to Java.

00:33:01.330 --> 00:33:04.900
And it's only like
another 16 Windows.

00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:06.517
Text editor font.

00:33:06.517 --> 00:33:07.850
AARON EPSTEIN: This is terrible.

00:33:07.850 --> 00:33:08.771
MAXWELL MANN: I know.

00:33:08.771 --> 00:33:10.020
I have to do it every lecture.

00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:11.556
16 is a good number.

00:33:11.556 --> 00:33:13.930
Let's make it bigger, because
you have better resolution.

00:33:13.930 --> 00:33:16.465
His computer's a beast.

00:33:16.465 --> 00:33:18.280
It's a pretty darn
nice computer.

00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:20.190
AARON EPSTEIN: OK cool.

00:33:20.190 --> 00:33:22.602
Alright, I've got tons of red.

00:33:22.602 --> 00:33:24.030
It didn't work.

00:33:24.030 --> 00:33:29.820
OK, so the conflict markers
are as obvious as they can be.

00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:32.350
Really big, loud, not part
of any programming language.

00:33:32.350 --> 00:33:34.280
Obviously errors that
you want to clean up.

00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:35.710
Nice x's.

00:33:35.710 --> 00:33:40.800
So what this is, head is the
head of my current stuff,

00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:42.670
so that's going to be my copy.

00:33:42.670 --> 00:33:45.900
And then this really
long number here

00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:50.070
is the hash name
of Max's commit.

00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:52.290
So this is Max's thing.

00:33:52.290 --> 00:33:55.220
Max made a comment, and
I changed the number.

00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:59.200
And so even though I know
that all of my changes

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:01.760
are going to be superior
to anything that Max wrote,

00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:03.350
Git doesn't know that.

00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:08.400
So since it's conflicted,
it asked me to fix it.

00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:15.239
In this case, I'll take what
Max wrote and add it to mine.

00:34:15.239 --> 00:34:17.350
And then delete it.

00:34:17.350 --> 00:34:21.050
Not the other way
around, by the way.

00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:23.050
MAXWELL MANN: Everybody's
got to have standards.

00:34:23.050 --> 00:34:23.969
AARON EPSTEIN: Yeah.

00:34:23.969 --> 00:34:26.719
Oh, I didn't delete that.

00:34:26.719 --> 00:34:29.630
Cool, so now it compiles.

00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:32.110
Probably still doesn't
beat the stupid [? rush ?]

00:34:32.110 --> 00:34:34.870
player OP stuff.

00:34:34.870 --> 00:34:38.949
[INAUDIBLE] It
compiles, and now I

00:34:38.949 --> 00:34:40.500
have to tell Git
about the success.

00:34:43.139 --> 00:34:48.045
So I do a commit, but before
I do the commit-- yeah?

00:34:48.045 --> 00:34:48.670
Getting it yet?

00:34:51.290 --> 00:34:53.020
Oh, it deleted awesomer player.

00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:55.210
That's what Max did
on his computer.

00:34:55.210 --> 00:34:58.540
And we both modified
robot player dot java.

00:34:58.540 --> 00:35:01.040
Pointing with my
mouse, remember.

00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:05.650
That's cool, but I fixed it.

00:35:05.650 --> 00:35:11.260
So, "merge a success.

00:35:11.260 --> 00:35:13.330
Cake imminent."

00:35:13.330 --> 00:35:14.490
Is that the right spelling?

00:35:14.490 --> 00:35:15.531
MAXWELL MANN: It's close.

00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:19.670
AARON EPSTEIN: OK.

00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:20.790
And then I push that.

00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:22.206
MAXWELL MANN: I'm
going to get it.

00:35:24.850 --> 00:35:26.940
Git pull origin master.

00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:29.550
I'm ready to push this button.

00:35:29.550 --> 00:35:36.141
And-- yeah.

00:35:36.141 --> 00:35:36.640
Cool,

00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:38.680
AARON EPSTEIN: So that's
a conflict resolution,

00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:41.580
which happens more
than is pleasant,

00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:46.364
but is not too hard to deal
with once you know you're doing.

00:35:46.364 --> 00:35:48.780
MAXWELL MANN: If we had edited
different lines of the same

00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:52.060
file, there'd be no conflict
because Github is so smart

00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:54.832
about which lines were
changed and which weren't.

00:35:54.832 --> 00:35:56.790
It would just go ahead
and it would merge those

00:35:56.790 --> 00:35:58.560
automatically.

00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:01.330
AARON EPSTEIN: Alright, so
before Max takes my changes

00:36:01.330 --> 00:36:03.470
and starts messing
around with them,

00:36:03.470 --> 00:36:06.800
I'm going to just mention,
but not thoroughly explain,

00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:10.190
a bunch of super
useful Git commands.

00:36:10.190 --> 00:36:12.790
If this wasn't enough, then if
you go look up these commands

00:36:12.790 --> 00:36:14.720
and what they're
for, then you'll

00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:19.299
be convinced that
Git is essential.

00:36:19.299 --> 00:36:19.840
Git checkout.

00:36:24.115 --> 00:36:24.615
Git log.

00:36:24.615 --> 00:36:26.025
Let me do this.

00:36:26.025 --> 00:36:28.400
If I show you the log, which
is something I forgot to do,

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:30.790
if you do a status before
and after each command,

00:36:30.790 --> 00:36:33.290
after you're done with the
second status, do a log.

00:36:33.290 --> 00:36:35.561
And log tells you
what's happened.

00:36:35.561 --> 00:36:36.560
Pointing with the mouse.

00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:38.510
OK, right?

00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:41.100
This is the whole
history of what happened.

00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:47.430
So Git checkout lets you take
any of these points in time

00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:50.330
and set your
repository, like you're

00:36:50.330 --> 00:36:53.100
working copy, the copy on
disk, to what was here.

00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:55.410
So if I want to go to what
happened before the bigger

00:36:55.410 --> 00:36:59.850
numbers commit, I could check
this out, and do Git checkout.

00:36:59.850 --> 00:37:01.190
Git branch.

00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:03.960
Branches lets you have
parallel workflows.

00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:06.006
It's really smooth.

00:37:06.006 --> 00:37:07.380
I have this document
that I found

00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:09.300
online that describes
a really good, really

00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:11.870
useful way of using branches.

00:37:11.870 --> 00:37:13.020
I'll discuss in the lab.

00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:18.930
Git reset hard.

00:37:18.930 --> 00:37:21.560
So, commit is like
a way of saying,

00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:22.580
these changes are great.

00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:23.163
They're solid.

00:37:23.163 --> 00:37:26.310
I like them, keep them.

00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:28.000
Anything you
haven't yet commited

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.260
can be obliterated
by reset hard.

00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:35.140
So you accidentally RMRF
one of your players.

00:37:35.140 --> 00:37:38.380
Or you make some change that
actually causes a divide

00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:39.870
by zero, and you
have no idea how,

00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:42.120
and you've spent half
an hour looking for.

00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:45.010
You've just given up and
you just want it gone.

00:37:45.010 --> 00:37:48.870
Git reset hard just obliterates
anything that's not committed.

00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:51.590
Stash does the same thing,
but puts it somewhere.

00:37:51.590 --> 00:37:54.900
And then you can take it
back off with stash pop.

00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:59.790
Git k summons a GUI visualizer
of the entire history.

00:37:59.790 --> 00:38:01.820
I'll just go ahead
and summon it.

00:38:01.820 --> 00:38:06.200
There's our history, there's
some diffs, what was changed.

00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:08.240
This was the merge,
how it looks.

00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:11.450
Great for visualizing
stuff if you're not,

00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:13.535
or even if you are good
at reading the terminal.

00:38:16.590 --> 00:38:17.440
Other commands.

00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:20.290
Diff shows you the difference
between two commits.

00:38:20.290 --> 00:38:22.844
Like if I added comment
to message channel, what?

00:38:22.844 --> 00:38:23.760
I don't remember that.

00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:24.810
What comment was it?

00:38:24.810 --> 00:38:30.170
I could do Git diff between
31d and the thing before it.

00:38:34.750 --> 00:38:37.700
Oh, 31d was ambiguous?

00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:40.420
One six.

00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:42.680
490 was ambiguous.

00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:44.940
MAXWELL MANN: Make it E36.

00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:46.950
AARON EPSTEIN: Cool.

00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:49.706
Oh, that's where I
deleted awesome player.

00:38:49.706 --> 00:38:51.580
It looks like you added
awesome player, which

00:38:51.580 --> 00:38:55.010
means I probably specified
in the wrong order.

00:38:55.010 --> 00:38:56.380
Yeah, so that's a comment.

00:38:56.380 --> 00:38:56.930
Cool.

00:38:56.930 --> 00:38:59.330
That's diff.

00:38:59.330 --> 00:39:02.800
Revert makes the
inverse of a commit,

00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:05.130
if you want to get rid of one.

00:39:05.130 --> 00:39:09.600
Bisect lets you do a binary
search through your history

00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:10.830
to find a bug.

00:39:10.830 --> 00:39:14.870
If you find out that
something-- you find out

00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:19.190
some cache you wrote three
weeks ago doesn't work anymore.

00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:21.480
It worked when you wrote,
but it doesn't work anymore,

00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:22.979
but you haven't
worked on it at all.

00:39:22.979 --> 00:39:25.835
So it's clearly something
caused by something else.

00:39:25.835 --> 00:39:28.460
It doesn't work this commit, it
doesn't work the commit before,

00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:31.850
so something you wrote somewhere
in the last three weeks

00:39:31.850 --> 00:39:34.880
broke your cache system and
you have no idea where it was.

00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:36.860
Git bisect lets you
binary search through

00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:41.190
your commit history to pinpoint
the location of the bug.

00:39:41.190 --> 00:39:44.340
Look it up, it's too complicated
to be explained in 30 seconds.

00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:46.300
But it saved me a
lot of time once,

00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:48.960
where I was looking a
bug for like four hours.

00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:49.880
I gave up.

00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:53.170
Bisect let me find
it in 30 minutes,

00:39:53.170 --> 00:39:56.684
and-- you know, programmer time.

00:39:56.684 --> 00:39:58.600
I hadn't used bisect, I
really would have just

00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:00.450
had to rewrite
sections of the engine.

00:40:00.450 --> 00:40:02.116
There was no way I
was going to find it.

00:40:02.116 --> 00:40:04.190
It was something really dumb.

00:40:04.190 --> 00:40:07.940
Blame does what it sounds like.

00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:19.110
So if I do get
blame on-- it tells

00:40:19.110 --> 00:40:21.870
me who was responsible
for every line.

00:40:21.870 --> 00:40:25.130
And the evidence is clear.

00:40:25.130 --> 00:40:27.100
The only person
I can claim blame

00:40:27.100 --> 00:40:31.450
for super awesome
players loss is myself.

00:40:31.450 --> 00:40:34.230
There's nothing here except me.

00:40:34.230 --> 00:40:36.180
It's all me.

00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:39.670
If Mad had changed some line,
like this one or whatever,

00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:42.050
if it wasn't checking this
encampment thing right,

00:40:42.050 --> 00:40:43.625
and it would have said Max man.

00:40:43.625 --> 00:40:45.000
And I could have
tracked it down.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.950
But no, it looks like
this file is all me.

00:40:47.950 --> 00:40:50.130
It's the only person I
can blame for my defeat.

00:40:50.130 --> 00:40:51.130
But anyway, blame.

00:40:51.130 --> 00:40:52.740
Blame people.

00:40:52.740 --> 00:40:53.390
It's great.

00:40:53.390 --> 00:40:55.181
MAXWELL MANN: That's
a pretty good summary.

00:40:55.181 --> 00:40:58.742
It seems like you've talked
about quite a lot of functions.

00:40:58.742 --> 00:41:00.450
AARON EPSTEIN: No
praising, only blaming.

00:41:00.450 --> 00:41:03.074
I actually think there is a less
negative version of blame that

00:41:03.074 --> 00:41:05.840
does the same thing,
but use blame.

00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:06.390
OK.

00:41:06.390 --> 00:41:09.220
MAXWELL MANN: So you've
covered what you need to cover.

00:41:09.220 --> 00:41:10.720
We've shown you
examples and things.

00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:12.450
We've given you summaries.

00:41:12.450 --> 00:41:14.260
I'm sure your mouths
are watering already.

00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:16.680
I want to give a
little bit of a demo,

00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:18.840
because the sprint tournament
is coming up so soon.

00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:21.120
The sprint tournament
submission deadline is Monday.

00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:22.890
So this is how you would submit.

00:41:22.890 --> 00:41:25.290
So if you haven't
submitted already,

00:41:25.290 --> 00:41:27.730
you right click on the
robot you want to submit.

00:41:27.730 --> 00:41:29.610
And you go to export.

00:41:29.610 --> 00:41:33.290
And I think the instructions
for this online.

00:41:33.290 --> 00:41:35.360
Yeah, we're going to
switch to my computer.

00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:37.920
My goodness, that
makes a lot of sense.

00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:41.620
So here we are, I'm going to
right click on the robot player

00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:43.390
that I want to submit.

00:41:43.390 --> 00:41:44.280
This is the package.

00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:47.860
I export, archive file.

00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:50.530
And I have to name it my team.

00:41:50.530 --> 00:41:53.840
So I need to actually change
the package name to team,

00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:56.270
and then my team
number in three digits.

00:41:56.270 --> 00:41:57.830
Otherwise it doesn't work.

00:41:57.830 --> 00:42:00.120
And then I'll just export
it to an archive file.

00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:03.370
This would export
to the desktop.

00:42:03.370 --> 00:42:06.770
And then later I can
go on to battle code,

00:42:06.770 --> 00:42:09.740
and I can say, alright,
upload my player.

00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:13.070
And I'll be able to choose
the JAR file from the desktop

00:42:13.070 --> 00:42:14.360
where I've got it.

00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:16.800
And I can give it my own name
and then I can submit it,

00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:20.330
and it'll tell me whether
it was compiled and worked

00:42:20.330 --> 00:42:21.380
successfully.

00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:23.870
So that's a complete
introduction,

00:42:23.870 --> 00:42:27.486
an entirely complete
explanation of Git.

00:42:27.486 --> 00:42:29.860
Everything you ever needed to
know, except for the things

00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:31.439
we're going to go over in lab.

00:42:31.439 --> 00:42:32.480
Aaron's shaking his head.

00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:35.850
There's a lot to learn, and it
only makes your life easier.

00:42:35.850 --> 00:42:38.140
It only helps.

00:42:38.140 --> 00:42:40.720
Except when it doesn't.

00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:44.390
So with that, the next lecture
is going to be on swarm,

00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:46.860
and I'll also cover some
topics in debugging.

00:42:46.860 --> 00:42:49.000
So you're going to watch
robots dancing around

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:52.340
in very mellifluous--
is that the right word?

00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:55.080
In any case, they're going
to dance in fancy ways.

00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:56.230
Fancy pants dance.

00:42:56.230 --> 00:42:57.734
And that'll take care of it.

00:42:57.734 --> 00:42:59.400
So thank you for
coming to this lecture.

00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:02.810
I hope you enjoy the Thai food,
and I'll see you tomorrow.
