00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:23.470
PROFESSOR: OK, let us start.

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.480
So maybe start by
reminding you what

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.900
we did in the last lecture.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.920
So you take the
black hole metric

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.740
so we explain that
you can actually

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:39.680
extend-- so this is the other
black hole horizon-- so you can

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.760
actually extend the
region outside the horizon

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.100
to actually four total regions
for the four black hole

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.600
spacetime.

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:55.680
And then this [? tag, ?]
this is a singularity.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.870
And of course, this
is only the rt plane,

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:06.440
and then you also have
[? s2. ?] So now [INAUDIBLE],

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.230
let me show that in
order for the metric

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.050
to be regular at the horizon
into this when you go

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.910
to Euclidean signature then
you want to identify Tau to be

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.860
periodic with this period.

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.990
So in essence, when you
go to Euclidean signature,

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.430
then this rt plane becomes,
essentially, a disc.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.860
And this Tau is in the angular
direction, and then the rho,

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.040
this r is in the
radial direction.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.980
And then the region of
this disc is the horizon.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.160
The region of the
disc is the horizon.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:51.590
So when you say, yeah, so
this Tau has to be periodic.

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.040
So that means if you fit any
theories in this spacetime,

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.050
then that theory must be
at a finite temperature

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.560
with inverse of this, which
gives you this [? H ?]

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.760
kappa divided by beta.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.400
And the kappa is
the surface gravity.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.220
So you can do a similar
thing with the [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.660
And the [INAUDIBLE] is just
1/4 of a Minkowski, which

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.570
[? forniated ?] in this way.

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.920
This is a constant
of the rho surface,

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.070
and this is a constant
of the eta surface.

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:30.220
And, again, [INAUDIBLE]
in eta to Euclidean.

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.660
And in order for the Euclidean
need [? congestion ?]

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.560
to be regular, the
region, then the theta

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.710
have to be periodical in 2pi.

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.900
And then this theta
essentially, again,

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.810
becomes an angular direction.

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.330
And then this implies
that the local observer

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.690
in the window of spacetime must
observe a temperature given

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.210
by this formula, OK?

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.400
Any questions regarding that?

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:26.041
Good, so today we
will talk about

00:03:26.041 --> 00:03:28.040
the physical interpretation
of this temperature.

00:03:47.291 --> 00:03:47.790
OK?

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.840
So let me just write down
what this temperature

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:02.830
means in words, so I will
use black hole as an example.

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.040
We can stay exactly
parallel [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.880
It says if you consider
a quantum fields

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:26.290
theory in the black
hole spacetime, then

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:30.540
the vacuum state-- so when
you put the quantum fields

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:35.375
theory, say, in the spacetime,
always ask, what is the vacuum?

00:04:35.375 --> 00:04:45.950
Then the vacuum state
for this curve t

00:04:45.950 --> 00:05:03.860
obtained via the analytic
continuation procedure

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:10.720
where the analytic continuation
procedure from Euclidean

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:24.340
signature is a
thermal equilibrium

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:40.400
state with the stated
temperature, OK?

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:57.930
So emphasize when you want
to talk about temperature,

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:03.830
you first have to specify
what is the time you use.

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:09.640
So this temperature refers to
this particular choice of time,

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.560
and so this is the temperature
corresponding to an observer

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.300
while using this time.

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.620
And then this is the time, as we
said, corresponding to observer

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.510
leaving at infinity.

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:22.690
And so this would
be the temperature

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:25.920
observed by the infinity.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:35.110
So similarly, this
temperature is the temperature

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:38.140
for given [? with ?]
the observer

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:40.370
at some location of rho.

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:41.770
So this is for local observer.

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:43.960
If you just talk about the
eta, then the temperature

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:48.460
is just h divided by 2pi because
theta is periodical in 2pi.

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:50.610
And if you ask what is
the temperature associated

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:53.230
with eta, it's just
h pi divided by 2pi.

00:06:59.686 --> 00:07:01.435
So any questions
regarding this statement?

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:12.040
So now let me
[INAUDIBLE] is going

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:15.347
to be abstract, so let me
elaborate a little bit,

00:07:15.347 --> 00:07:16.555
and let me make some remarks.

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:36.850
So the first is that
the choice of vacuum

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:50.740
for QFT in the curved
spacetime is not unique.

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:57.640
So this is a standard feature.

00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:59.880
This is a standard
feature, so if you

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:02.734
want to define a quantum fields
theory in the curved space time

00:08:02.734 --> 00:08:04.650
because, in general, in
the curved space time,

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:08.080
there's no prefer
the choice of time.

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.910
So in order to quantize here,
you have to choose a time.

00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:14.210
So depending on
your choice of time,

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:17.190
then you can quantize your
theory in a different way.

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:20.800
And then you have a
different possibility

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.660
of what is your vacuum.

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:26.840
So in other words, in
the curved spacetime,

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:28.965
in general, the vacuum
is observer dependent.

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:37.360
So of course, the black hole
is the curved spacetime, so

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:42.539
the particular
continuation procedure

00:08:42.539 --> 00:09:05.580
we described corresponds
to a particular choice,

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:14.890
to a special choice,
of the vacuum.

00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:20.110
In the case of a
black hole, this

00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:32.340
has been called to be
the Hartle-Hawking vacuum

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:36.090
because the Hartle-Hawking
first defined it

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:39.750
from this Euclidean procedure.

00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:45.430
And for the Rindler
spacetime, time

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:49.962
so we see a little bit
later in today's class

00:09:49.962 --> 00:09:55.370
that this is actually--
the choice of vacuum

00:09:55.370 --> 00:10:00.190
actually just goes one into the
standard of the Minkowski way

00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:00.690
vacuum.

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:10.320
reduced to the Rindler patch.

00:10:25.889 --> 00:10:27.430
So of course, you
can actually choose

00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:30.860
the vacuum in some other way.

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:50.550
For example, say if
for a black hole,

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:54.870
instead of periodically
identify Tau with this period,

00:10:54.870 --> 00:11:00.090
we can choose not to
identify Tau at all.

00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:13.390
Suppose for a black hole,
in Euclidean signature

00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:18.550
we take Tau to be uncompact.

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:26.022
So we don't identify.

00:11:26.022 --> 00:11:30.520
So this, of course, runs into
a different Euclidean manifold.

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:33.570
Then that corresponds to a
different Euclidean manifold.

00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:39.322
And, again, you can really
continue the Euclidean theory

00:11:39.322 --> 00:11:42.240
on this manifold
back to [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:45.150
to define our vacuum.

00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:47.310
And that gives you
a different vacuum

00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:51.520
from the one in which
you identified Tau.

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:53.910
So this gives you a so-called
Schwarzschild vacuum.

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:05.520
Or sometimes people
call it Boulware vacuum

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:12.550
because Boulware had worked
on it in the early days

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:13.490
before other people.

00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:20.120
And, in fact, this
Schwarzschild vacuum

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:21.245
is the most natural vacuum.

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:33.720
In fact, this is
the vacuum that one

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:55.150
would get by doing
canonical connotation

00:12:55.150 --> 00:13:05.490
in the black hole in terms
of this Schwarzschild time t.

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:19.585
So let me just emphasize, so
this is a curbed spacetime.

00:13:19.585 --> 00:13:20.960
You can just put
a quantum fields

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:23.630
theory in this spacetime,
and then there's

00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:29.110
a time here which, actually,
the spacetime is time dependent.

00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:32.360
So you have a time-independent
Hamiltonian [? so ?] respect

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:33.527
to this time.

00:13:33.527 --> 00:13:34.943
And so, in principal,
you can just

00:13:34.943 --> 00:13:38.150
do a straightforward
canonical connotation.

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:41.520
And then that connotation
will give you a vacuum.

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:45.560
And that vacuum would
corresponding to the same

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:48.040
as you do analytic
continuation to the Euclidean.

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:53.364
And don't compact Phi
Tau because there's

00:13:53.364 --> 00:13:54.030
nothing special.

00:13:56.817 --> 00:13:58.650
Just like when you do
a 0 temperature fields

00:13:58.650 --> 00:14:03.400
theory in the standard
Minkowski spacetime.

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:05.877
But when you compactify
Tau, then you

00:14:05.877 --> 00:14:06.835
get a different vacuum.

00:14:06.835 --> 00:14:10.750
It is what would be now called
a Hartle-Hawking vacuum,

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:14.890
and it's what you get
a finite temperature.

00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:15.540
Is this clear?

00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:19.846
Yes?

00:14:19.846 --> 00:14:22.095
AUDIENCE: So in what sense
are these different vacuums

00:14:22.095 --> 00:14:23.110
physical or not?

00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:26.990
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I will answer
this question in a little bit.

00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:30.450
Right now, I want
you to be clear.

00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:33.830
Right now we have two
different vacuum here

00:14:33.830 --> 00:14:36.475
corresponding to
two different ways

00:14:36.475 --> 00:14:38.710
of doing analytic continuation.

00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:41.625
And one way you compactify
Tau, and one way

00:14:41.625 --> 00:14:43.440
you don't compactify Tau.

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:45.680
And the way you
don't compactify Tau

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:48.080
is actually the most
straightforward way.

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:50.090
So if you just do a
straightforward canonical

00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:53.400
connotation using
this time, then that

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:54.870
will be the vacuum you get.

00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:58.526
So that's why this is called
a Schwarzschild vacuum, OK?

00:14:58.526 --> 00:15:03.390
AUDIENCE: So do you not have
a similarity in writing?

00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:05.030
PROFESSOR: I will
talk about that.

00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:13.280
So similarly for
the Rindler, again,

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:16.590
if you do straightforward
canonical connotation,

00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:20.080
in this spacetime with
eta has your time,

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:21.900
then when you go to
Euclidean signature,

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:24.780
you want compactify the
Euclidean version of eta.

00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:26.120
Then you won't compactify theta.

00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:42.824
So if you take the
theta to be uncompact,

00:15:42.824 --> 00:15:44.740
then you get what is
so-called Rindler vacuum.

00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:54.520
So it just, again,
can be obtained.

00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:32.430
So then you ask them, why do we
bother to define those vacuums?

00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:37.810
Why do we bother to make this
identification given that this

00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:39.190
is the most
straightforward thing

00:16:39.190 --> 00:16:42.010
to do, say, when we
consider this quantum fields

00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:45.850
theory inside curved spacetimes.

00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:49.050
So here is the
key, and so that's

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:50.820
where the geometric
consideration becomes

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:52.260
important.

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:55.940
So, again, let me just
first use the black hole

00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:58.090
as an example case.

00:16:58.090 --> 00:17:15.839
So in the Schwarzschild vacuum,
the corresponding Euclidean

00:17:15.839 --> 00:17:28.990
manifold is singular
add to the horizon.

00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:38.760
So we explained last time,
when we do this [INAUDIBLE],

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:43.970
the spacetime is
regular only for

00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:46.260
this periodic identification.

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:48.880
For any other
possibilities, then you

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:54.980
will have a conical
singularity add to the horizon.

00:17:54.980 --> 00:18:04.310
So this implies the Euclidean
manifold singular horizon.

00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:06.470
Say, if you cut computer
correlation function

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:12.161
[INAUDIBLE], then you can have
single behavior at the horizon.

00:18:12.161 --> 00:18:13.660
In particular, when
you analytically

00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:15.895
continue to
[INAUDIBLE] signature,

00:18:15.895 --> 00:18:29.180
then that means that
physical observables often

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:41.660
are singular after the horizon.

00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:50.310
So we need to continue
to [INAUDIBLE] signature.

00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:54.630
For example-- which actually
I should have maybe the

00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:58.240
[INAUDIBLE] problem but
then forgot earlier.

00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:00.890
For example, you
can check yourself

00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:04.610
that just take a free
scalar fields theory.

00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:08.910
You compute the stress tensor
from this free scalar fields

00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:13.020
theory, and you find
the stress tensor

00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:20.640
of this theory blows up after
the horizon in the Minkowski

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:21.140
vacuum.

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:29.470
And if this is not the
case, for the vacuum

00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:35.080
we obtained by doing analytic
continuation this way--

00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:44.850
so this is not the case for
a Hartle-Hawking vacuum.

00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:53.247
So Hartle-Hawking vacuum
just is [? lame ?]

00:19:53.247 --> 00:19:55.580
for the vacuum we obtained
by this analytic continuation

00:19:55.580 --> 00:20:08.410
procedure for which all
observer was regular just,

00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:11.095
essentially, by definition,
by construction.

00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:27.360
So essentially by construction
because Euclidean manifold

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:31.410
is completely smooth, and if you
want to compute any correlation

00:20:31.410 --> 00:20:34.350
function-- for example, you can
compute the Euclidean signature

00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:37.360
and then I need you to continue
back to [INAUDIBLE] signature

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:39.860
because it's the smooth side
of the horizon of the Euclidean

00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:40.030
signature.

00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:41.238
I need the continuation back.

00:20:41.238 --> 00:20:44.565
We also give you a regular
function at the horizon there.

00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:53.520
So similar remarks apply
to the Rindler space,

00:20:53.520 --> 00:21:02.870
and this Rindler vacuum will
be singular at this Rindler

00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:04.200
horizon.

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:07.600
It will be singular
at Rindler horizon.

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:15.800
So since from the
general relativity,

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:17.570
the horizon is a smooth place.

00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:25.397
The curvature there
can be very small

00:21:25.397 --> 00:21:27.105
if you have a big
black hole [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:35.270
So physically, we believe that
these Hartle-Hawking vacuums

00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:38.390
are more physical then, for
example, the Schwarzschild

00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:40.130
vacuum.

00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:44.140
But Schwarzschild is still
often used for certain purposes.

00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:47.400
But if you want to consider
these physical observables,

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:50.050
then the Hartle-Hawking
vacuum should be the right one

00:21:50.050 --> 00:21:53.460
to use if you don't want
to encounter singularities

00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:56.310
at the horizon.

00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:58.980
Any questions?

00:21:58.980 --> 00:21:59.591
Yes?

00:21:59.591 --> 00:22:00.507
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:04.583
PROFESSOR: No.

00:22:04.583 --> 00:22:05.499
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:05.499 --> 00:22:07.350
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:12.994
Yeah, because, for example,
Euclidean Tau is uncompact.

00:22:12.994 --> 00:22:16.264
AUDIENCE: So the singularity
of the physical variables

00:22:16.264 --> 00:22:21.720
[INAUDIBLE] to become
singular to Hartle-Hawking?

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:23.444
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's right.

00:22:23.444 --> 00:22:24.360
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:35.550
PROFESSOR: I would say this
is the physical reason.

00:22:35.550 --> 00:22:41.750
If I think about it, I might
other not-so-essential reasons.

00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:44.926
Yeah, but at the moment, I
could not think of any others.

00:22:44.926 --> 00:22:45.782
Yeah?

00:22:45.782 --> 00:22:47.407
AUDIENCE: So if I
understand correctly,

00:22:47.407 --> 00:22:49.365
when you quantize a theory
in curved spacetime,

00:22:49.365 --> 00:22:51.875
you have to choose a space-like
foliation of your spacetime,

00:22:51.875 --> 00:22:54.370
then you quantize it on
that foliation basically.

00:22:54.370 --> 00:22:57.590
So the problem is that I
still don't understand.

00:22:57.590 --> 00:22:59.300
So the different
ground suits that you

00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:01.680
get for different possible
quantizations based

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:02.680
on different foliations.

00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:05.750
Like, to what degree are
they compatible versus

00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:07.730
incompatible with each other?

00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:10.430
Are they at odds
with each other?

00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:12.170
Like is one more real
than another one,

00:23:12.170 --> 00:23:14.160
or is it just sort of an
artifact of your coordinates,

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:15.210
and there are things
that we can do

00:23:15.210 --> 00:23:17.330
which are independent of
which one we end up with.

00:23:17.330 --> 00:23:22.630
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so
first, in general, they

00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:25.165
are physically
inequivalent to each other.

00:23:25.165 --> 00:23:28.170
For example, in this case,
the Schwarzschild vacuum

00:23:28.170 --> 00:23:32.340
is physically inequivalent
to the Hartle-Hawking vacuum.

00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:37.080
And actually, with a
little bit of work,

00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:40.360
one can write down the
explicit relation between them.

00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:44.885
And so from the perspective
of the Schwarzschild vacuum,

00:23:44.885 --> 00:23:46.760
the Hartle-Hawking vacuum
is a highly excited

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:50.550
state and vice versa.

00:23:50.550 --> 00:23:52.140
So vice versa.

00:23:52.140 --> 00:24:03.285
And so, yeah, for local
observable, say in the local,

00:24:03.285 --> 00:24:04.490
it depends.

00:24:04.490 --> 00:24:18.550
I think the vacuum is
more like-- sometimes

00:24:18.550 --> 00:24:21.070
certain vacuums are more
convenient for a certain

00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:22.740
observer and a
certain vacuum is more

00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:24.170
convenient for that observer.

00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:26.270
Sometimes it depends on
your physical [INAUDIBLE],

00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:26.770
et cetera.

00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:31.470
And other questions?

00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:36.290
AUDIENCE: So we cannot treat
these two vacuums as like some

00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:37.852
transformation?

00:24:37.852 --> 00:24:40.310
PROFESSOR: Yeah, there is some
transformation between them.

00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:44.170
AUDIENCE: So they
stay just the same?

00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:47.710
Like do [INAUDIBLE]?

00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:49.420
PROFESSOR: No, they
are different states.

00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:51.324
They are completely
different states.

00:24:51.324 --> 00:24:52.990
You can relate to
them in a certain way,

00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:54.769
but they're different states.

00:24:54.769 --> 00:24:56.060
Yeah, they're different states.

00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:58.750
AUDIENCE: If they are
different, than why can

00:24:58.750 --> 00:25:02.080
we only say one is wrong?

00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:06.600
Because, for example, if it's
singular, it's not physical,

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:09.475
why don't we just discard it?

00:25:09.475 --> 00:25:10.350
PROFESSOR: I'm sorry?

00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:11.990
AUDIENCE: Why we--

00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:14.390
PROFESSOR: Yeah, physically
we do discard it.

00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:18.730
Physically we don't think
the Schwarzschild vacuum is--

00:25:18.730 --> 00:25:20.840
so here there's assumption.

00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:25.110
So the assumption is that we
believe that the physics is now

00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:26.290
single at the horizon.

00:25:26.290 --> 00:25:29.260
So this is a basic assumption.

00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:32.730
And if that's the
basic assumption,

00:25:32.730 --> 00:25:35.710
then you should abandon
Schwarzschild vacuum

00:25:35.710 --> 00:25:39.160
as the physical
choice of the vacuum.

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:44.160
Then you say, then if we really
do experiment in the black hole

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:45.830
geometry, then what
you will discover

00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:50.060
is the property of the
Hartle-Hawking vacuum.

00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:53.730
But if our physical
assumption is wrong

00:25:53.730 --> 00:25:56.500
that actually a black
hole horizon is singular,

00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:59.490
then maybe Schwarzschild horizon
will turn out to be right.

00:25:59.490 --> 00:26:02.127
But in this case, we
actually don't know.

00:26:02.127 --> 00:26:04.210
We cannot really do
experiments in the black hole,

00:26:04.210 --> 00:26:07.400
so we cannot really check it.

00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:09.990
AUDIENCE: But we can measure
black hole temperature

00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:12.240
from infinitely far away,
and the Schwarzschild

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:13.480
vacuum it would be 0.

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:15.560
PROFESSOR: No, but
you cannot measure it.

00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:17.625
We have not been
able to measure it.

00:26:17.625 --> 00:26:19.370
AUDIENCE: And what
about the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:24.790
PROFESSOR: Yeah, first
produce the black hole first.

00:26:24.790 --> 00:26:27.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:29.570
Yeah, we will worry
about it after we

00:26:29.570 --> 00:26:30.779
have produced the black hole.

00:26:30.779 --> 00:26:32.319
AUDIENCE: But if
they didn't radiate,

00:26:32.319 --> 00:26:33.544
they would not decay at all.

00:26:33.544 --> 00:26:35.460
PROFESSOR: Yeah, then
you may also not see it.

00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:47.820
Anyway, so this can considered
as a physical interpretation

00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:51.270
of the temperature inside
the regularity at the horizon

00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:54.010
force us to be in this
Hartle-Hawking vacuum.

00:26:54.010 --> 00:26:55.860
And then the
Hartle-Hawking vacuum

00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:57.210
is like [? a similar ?] state.

00:26:57.210 --> 00:27:02.160
OK, so now they may
explain why [? they ?] say,

00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:04.970
they will behavior like
[? a similar ?] state, OK?

00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:08.490
So let me go to the second
thing I will explain today.

00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:11.194
It's the physical origin
of the temperature.

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:25.390
So, again, I can use either
black hole or the Rindler

00:27:25.390 --> 00:27:25.970
example.

00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:28.780
The mathematics are
almost identical.

00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:30.310
But I will use the
Rindler example

00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:35.270
because the mathematics
are slightly simpler.

00:27:35.270 --> 00:27:37.760
So I will use the
window of spacetime.

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:49.250
So I will explain using
the Rindler example.

00:27:55.360 --> 00:28:04.710
So I will explain at A
that this choice of theta

00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:08.800
to periodically identify theta
plus theta plus 2pi [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:11.600
into the choice of
a Minkowski vacuum.

00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:25.960
Then the second
thing I will do is

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:41.439
I will derive this temperature--
derive the temperature using

00:28:41.439 --> 00:28:42.230
a different method.

00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:52.950
So that's I will do today.

00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:56.380
So here, when me say,
this temperature,

00:28:56.380 --> 00:28:59.890
we just directly
read the temperature

00:28:59.890 --> 00:29:09.480
from the period of the
Tau, OK but I will really

00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:13.880
derive with the
thermal density matrix.

00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:17.270
And then you will see that
this temperature is indeed

00:29:17.270 --> 00:29:19.745
the temperature with appears
in the density matrix.

00:29:27.362 --> 00:29:27.945
Any questions?

00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:37.640
So these two
together also amounts

00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:39.304
to the following statement.

00:29:39.304 --> 00:29:40.720
So this is an
important statement,

00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:46.660
so let me just write it
down, so this A and B also

00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:48.472
amounts to be the
following-- also

00:29:48.472 --> 00:29:50.180
is equivalent to the
following statement.

00:29:53.450 --> 00:30:13.111
It says, the vacuum
inside the Minkowski--

00:30:13.111 --> 00:30:14.860
the standard of the
Minkowski vacuum where

00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:20.350
you do your quantum
fields theory,

00:30:20.350 --> 00:30:28.390
the Minkowski vacuum appears
to be in a similar state.

00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:43.940
This temperature which
is pi divided by 2pi or T

00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:47.690
equal to hbar divided
by 2pi in terms of eta.

00:30:52.470 --> 00:31:05.291
OK, it depends on which time
you use to a Rindler observer

00:31:05.291 --> 00:31:06.540
of constant acceleration rate.

00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:28.684
So a says, actually, this choice
[INAUDIBLE] a periodic of 2pi,

00:31:28.684 --> 00:31:30.600
actually we are choosing
the Minkowski vacuum.

00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:36.660
And then the second
statement you said,

00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:38.910
but the stand of the
Minkowski vacuum, which

00:31:38.910 --> 00:31:44.130
appears to be 0 temperature
to ordinary Minkowski observer

00:31:44.130 --> 00:31:49.450
than appears to be a similar
state to a Rindler observer.

00:31:49.450 --> 00:31:51.860
OK, so that's the
physical content

00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:55.470
of this things
which we will show.

00:31:55.470 --> 00:31:56.450
Any questions on this?

00:32:06.130 --> 00:32:06.807
Yes?

00:32:06.807 --> 00:32:07.723
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:32:15.709 --> 00:32:17.500
PROFESSOR: It's actually
a tricky question.

00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:24.390
In some sense, they don't really
belong to the same Hilbert

00:32:24.390 --> 00:32:25.474
space.

00:32:25.474 --> 00:32:27.640
Yeah just when you talk
about quantum fields theory,

00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:28.560
it's a little bit
tricky when you have

00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:29.851
an infinite number [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:35.368
Yeah, but one can write down
the relation between them.

00:32:35.368 --> 00:32:37.760
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:40.260
PROFESSOR: Yeah, one can write
down a relation between them,

00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:42.737
and then if you take the
[? modulus ?] of that vacuum.

00:32:42.737 --> 00:32:44.570
Then you'll find that
it's actually infinite

00:32:44.570 --> 00:32:46.780
because you have an infinite
number that [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:54.350
It's not possible to
normalize that state.

00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:57.300
OK, so that's what
we are going to show.

00:32:57.300 --> 00:33:01.560
Hopefully, we will reach
it by the end of this hour.

00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:10.300
But before that, we need a
little bit of preparation

00:33:10.300 --> 00:33:11.550
to remind you of a few things.

00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:17.140
So once we go through
these preparation,

00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:24.500
then final derivation only
takes less than 10 minutes.

00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:28.865
So first, he said, they are
actually two descriptions

00:33:28.865 --> 00:33:30.110
of a similar state.

00:33:37.815 --> 00:33:38.690
So let me remind you.

00:33:38.690 --> 00:33:40.565
They are two descriptions
of a similar state.

00:33:49.690 --> 00:33:53.880
So we will use harmonic
oscillator as an example.

00:34:01.290 --> 00:34:06.470
So now let's consider a
single harmonic oscillator

00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:09.600
a finite temperature.

00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:13.039
So the standard
way of doing it is

00:34:13.039 --> 00:34:14.830
that if you want to
compute the expectation

00:34:14.830 --> 00:34:17.889
value of some operator,
of some observable

00:34:17.889 --> 00:34:21.389
at finite temperature,
you just do

00:34:21.389 --> 00:34:26.659
the standard canonical average.

00:34:32.239 --> 00:34:35.150
So the H would be,
say, the Hamiltonian

00:34:35.150 --> 00:34:37.400
of this single
harmonic oscillator,

00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:41.120
and the z is the
partition function.

00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:46.635
So can also be written as trace
x and as a thermal density

00:34:46.635 --> 00:34:47.135
matrix.

00:34:51.080 --> 00:35:07.590
So the thermal density
matrix is 1/z minus beta h,

00:35:07.590 --> 00:35:11.340
and the z is just the sum
of all possible states.

00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:21.390
So this is a standard
way you would do, say,

00:35:21.390 --> 00:35:24.430
the finite temperature physics.

00:35:24.430 --> 00:35:28.240
So this, of course, applies
to any quantum systems

00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:31.890
causal quantum fields
theories, et cetera.

00:35:31.890 --> 00:35:35.570
But actually, this
alternative way

00:35:35.570 --> 00:35:42.630
to do thermal physics-- so
this was realized by Umezawa

00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:52.900
in the 1960s.

00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:57.790
So he said, instead
of considering

00:35:57.790 --> 00:36:01.730
this thermal density
matrix, let me just consider

00:36:01.730 --> 00:36:03.339
two copies of the same.

00:36:03.339 --> 00:36:05.380
Let's consider two copies
of harmonic oscillator.

00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:30.840
Let's double the copy,
and then now we have H1.

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:35.660
Then the foreseeable
space for these two copies

00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:40.150
will be the H1 of one
system tensor product of H2

00:36:40.150 --> 00:36:43.500
and the Hilbert
space of the other.

00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:50.100
And then you will have H1
H2, the Hamiltonian H1 H2

00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:52.020
associated with each of them.

00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:53.960
But, of course, these
two H's are the same.

00:36:58.350 --> 00:37:10.210
Then the [INAUDIBLE]
system in a typical state

00:37:10.210 --> 00:37:18.610
would be, say, of the form
sum mn, amn, m1 [? canceled ?]

00:37:18.610 --> 00:37:22.950
with n and 2.

00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:26.170
So the general state, say,
of this doubled system

00:37:26.170 --> 00:37:26.920
will be like this.

00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:32.520
So this is two copies of the
same system with no interaction

00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:33.210
with each other.

00:37:36.182 --> 00:37:38.390
So now he says, in order to
consider thermal physics,

00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:42.900
let's consider
special state defined

00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:50.868
by the following, 1 over
square root of z sum over n.

00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:07.850
And he said, now let's
consider the following states.

00:38:10.570 --> 00:38:14.350
So this is an entangled state
between the two systems.

00:38:14.350 --> 00:38:15.870
So this is an entangled state.

00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:33.140
So the key observation
is that if you

00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:36.980
want to consider
the thermal physics,

00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:48.370
it says, for any observable,
say this x-- so [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:48.370 --> 00:38:53.270
1, which only acts in
one of the systems.

00:39:01.450 --> 00:39:05.720
[INAUDIBLE] act on
the first system.

00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:08.830
So let's consider
any such observable.

00:39:08.830 --> 00:39:10.420
So now, if you to
take the expectation

00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:43.950
value between the sides,
the x between the sides,

00:39:43.950 --> 00:39:45.770
so you essentially
have a side squared.

00:39:45.770 --> 00:39:48.540
Then you have 1/z.

00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:52.596
Then also Tau will
become better En,

00:39:52.596 --> 00:40:08.130
and then this just becomes 1/z
sum over n [INAUDIBLE] and x n.

00:40:08.130 --> 00:40:10.110
So this is the thermal average.

00:40:15.140 --> 00:40:16.080
This is sum average.

00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:27.720
So if you understand
the why, you can also

00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:34.000
consider because if we are
interested only in system 1,

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.700
then you can just
integrate our system 2.

00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:39.630
We can trace our system 2.

00:40:39.630 --> 00:40:42.530
Say, suppose we
trace our system 2

00:40:42.530 --> 00:40:53.550
of this state, then, of
course, what do you find?

00:41:04.750 --> 00:41:09.880
Which is the thermal density
matrix of the system 1.

00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:19.290
So in other words, the thermal
density matrix in one system

00:41:19.290 --> 00:41:23.800
can be considered as
[? entangled ?] pure states

00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:26.870
of a doubled system.

00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:30.450
And because we know nothing
about the other system,

00:41:30.450 --> 00:41:36.550
once we trace the l to
the other system, then

00:41:36.550 --> 00:41:40.060
you get a density matrix.

00:41:40.060 --> 00:41:43.610
And this density matrix comes
from our insufficient knowledge

00:41:43.610 --> 00:41:44.570
of the other system.

00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:50.310
So this is another way to think
about this thermal behavior.

00:41:53.761 --> 00:41:55.530
Do you have any
questions on this?

00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:22.730
So the temperature arises due
to an ignorance of system 2.

00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:32.060
So because if you now have full
knowledge of one of the two,

00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:36.060
then this would be just the
[? size ?] of a pure state.

00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:40.370
It's just a very
special pure state.

00:42:40.370 --> 00:42:44.040
But if you don't know
anything about system 2

00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:46.882
and if you consent of
only about system 1,

00:42:46.882 --> 00:42:48.590
then when you trace
out system 2 then you

00:42:48.590 --> 00:42:53.180
get the thermal
density matrix for 1.

00:42:53.180 --> 00:42:55.790
So let me make some
additional remarks on this.

00:42:58.119 --> 00:42:59.410
I'll make some further remarks.

00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:09.300
First, this, of course,
applies to any--

00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:13.440
even though I'm saying I'm using
the harmonic oscillator, this,

00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:19.551
of course, applies to any
quantum systems including

00:43:19.551 --> 00:43:20.050
the QFT's.

00:43:25.620 --> 00:43:29.250
So the second remark is
that this side is actually

00:43:29.250 --> 00:43:31.560
a very special state.

00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:47.110
This size is invariant under
H1 minus H2, H1 minus H2.

00:43:47.110 --> 00:43:48.980
So you can see it very
clearly from here.

00:43:52.750 --> 00:43:59.030
It says, if you add H1 and
H2 on this state, H1 minus H2

00:43:59.030 --> 00:44:03.420
because both n's have the same
energy, so they just cancel.

00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:11.640
So this is invariant
under this-- yeah,

00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:25.730
I should say, more precisely,
it's [? annihilated ?]

00:44:25.730 --> 00:44:28.570
by H1 minus H2.

00:44:28.570 --> 00:44:33.080
And it's invariant
under any translation

00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:35.864
created by H1 minus H2.

00:44:35.864 --> 00:44:36.780
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:44:42.444 --> 00:44:44.110
PROFESSOR: Yeah, just
double the system.

00:44:44.110 --> 00:44:45.832
It's two copies of
the same system.

00:44:57.150 --> 00:45:08.130
So the third remark now relies
on the harmonic oscillator.

00:45:08.130 --> 00:45:18.750
For the harmonic
oscillator, we can write

00:45:18.750 --> 00:45:21.250
this psi in the following form.

00:45:26.539 --> 00:45:27.830
So this you can check yourself.

00:45:27.830 --> 00:45:31.010
I only write down the answer.

00:45:31.010 --> 00:45:34.690
You can easily convince
yourself this is true.

00:45:34.690 --> 00:45:37.481
Some of you might be able
to see it immediately just

00:45:37.481 --> 00:45:38.230
on the blackboard.

00:45:50.150 --> 00:45:52.540
As you actually
write this in the--

00:45:52.540 --> 00:45:56.550
if you can write this as some
explanation of some-- so a1 a2

00:45:56.550 --> 00:46:02.310
are creation operators
respectfully for two systems.

00:46:02.310 --> 00:46:06.280
And then the 0 1 and 0 2
are the vacuum of the two

00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:09.350
harmonic oscillator systems.

00:46:09.350 --> 00:46:11.210
And you can easily
see yourself, when

00:46:11.210 --> 00:46:15.250
you expand this exponential,
then you essentially

00:46:15.250 --> 00:46:18.130
just take the power of n.

00:46:18.130 --> 00:46:21.350
And then that will give you n.

00:46:21.350 --> 00:46:25.900
Yeah, when you act on 0 0,
then that will n a times n, OK?

00:46:29.310 --> 00:46:32.980
So this is normally
called a squeezed state.

00:46:32.980 --> 00:46:36.050
So this tells you
that this psi is

00:46:36.050 --> 00:46:39.280
related to the
vacuum of the system

00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:42.900
by some kind of squeezed--
so this is a squeezed state

00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:46.480
in terms of the vacuum.

00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:51.015
So this form is useful
for the following reason.

00:46:53.710 --> 00:47:01.740
It's that now, based
on these three,

00:47:01.740 --> 00:47:11.880
one can show it's
possible to construct

00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:23.420
two oscillators, which are
b1 and b2, which [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:23.420 --> 00:47:24.280
the psi.

00:47:27.690 --> 00:47:33.270
So the b1 and b2 are
constructed by the following.

00:47:33.270 --> 00:47:36.360
So, again, this you
should check yourself.

00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:39.540
It's easy to do a
little bit of algebra.

00:47:55.280 --> 00:48:03.670
So cos theta is
equal to 1 over 1

00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:07.860
minus the exponential
minus beta omega.

00:48:07.860 --> 00:48:12.240
So the omega is the frequency
for this harmonic oscillator

00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:14.840
system and the [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:40.267
So this b1 b2 are
related to a1 a2

00:48:40.267 --> 00:48:41.516
by some linear transformation.

00:48:44.770 --> 00:48:54.730
So what this shows is that
[? while ?] 0 1 and the 0 2

00:48:54.730 --> 00:49:05.920
is a vacuum for a1
and a2, and this side

00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:11.370
is a vacuum for b1 b2.

00:49:14.182 --> 00:49:15.640
So then maybe you
can see that this

00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:17.514
goes [? into ?] a
different choice of vacuum.

00:49:20.340 --> 00:49:21.990
So as we'll see
later, the relation

00:49:21.990 --> 00:49:23.490
between the so-called
Hartle-Hawking

00:49:23.490 --> 00:49:26.900
vacuum and the Schwarzschild
vacuum is precisely like this.

00:49:30.149 --> 00:49:32.190
They just, of course, run
into a different choice

00:49:32.190 --> 00:49:33.274
of alternators.

00:49:33.274 --> 00:49:34.690
And, in particular,
their relation

00:49:34.690 --> 00:49:38.810
is precise over this
form because, say,

00:49:38.810 --> 00:49:41.099
if you consider some
[? three ?] series

00:49:41.099 --> 00:49:43.390
because the [? three ?] series
essentially just reduces

00:49:43.390 --> 00:49:44.390
to harmonic oscillators.

00:49:46.726 --> 00:49:50.170
OK, so this is the
first preparation.

00:49:50.170 --> 00:49:52.140
And those things are
very easy check yourself

00:49:52.140 --> 00:49:56.710
because this is just a
single harmonic oscillator.

00:49:56.710 --> 00:49:57.710
Any questions on this?

00:50:12.230 --> 00:50:18.076
Oh, by the way, this
kind of transformation

00:50:18.076 --> 00:50:19.825
is often called
Bogoliubov transformation.

00:50:32.220 --> 00:50:39.560
So the [INAUDIBLE] you
assume by this transformation

00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:43.040
is that in the
expression for b1 b2,

00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:46.390
a [? dagger ?] appears here.

00:50:46.390 --> 00:50:52.610
If there is only a that appears
here, then b1 b2, a1, a2,

00:50:52.610 --> 00:50:55.470
they will have the same
vacuum because they will

00:50:55.470 --> 00:50:57.831
[INAUDIBLE] the same states.

00:50:57.831 --> 00:51:00.330
So the [? nontrivial ?] thing
is because of the [? dagger ?]

00:51:00.330 --> 00:51:05.750
appearing here, so now the state
which they are [INAUDIBLE] are

00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:07.980
completely different and
[? graded ?] by this kind

00:51:07.980 --> 00:51:11.760
of squeezed-state relation.

00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:12.470
Yes?

00:51:12.470 --> 00:51:15.330
AUDIENCE: So it's related
to the H2 minus H2?

00:51:15.330 --> 00:51:16.240
PROFESSOR: I'm sorry?

00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:18.185
AUDIENCE: The
operators like b1 b2

00:51:18.185 --> 00:51:20.114
are somewhat similar
to the H1 minus H2?

00:51:20.114 --> 00:51:21.030
PROFESSOR: Not really.

00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:26.250
You can write down H1 H2
in terms of b1 and b2.

00:51:26.250 --> 00:51:28.140
You can certainly do that.

00:51:28.140 --> 00:51:30.157
Yeah, but H1 H2 is
also very simply.

00:51:30.157 --> 00:51:31.490
You write in terms of a1 and a2.

00:51:34.225 --> 00:51:40.140
AUDIENCE: If a letter
transformation [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:40.140 --> 00:51:45.002
we get-- never mind.

00:51:45.002 --> 00:51:47.520
PROFESSOR: Yeah, you can
find the b1 [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:50.520
Just take the conjugate.

00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:55.620
Good, so this is the
first preparation,

00:51:55.620 --> 00:52:02.490
which is just something about
the harmonic oscillator, which

00:52:02.490 --> 00:52:10.480
actually can be generalized
also to general quantum systems.

00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:16.730
So the second is I need
to remind you a little bit

00:52:16.730 --> 00:52:27.060
the Schrodinger
representation of QFT's.

00:52:32.420 --> 00:52:35.635
So normally when we talk
about quantum field theory,

00:52:35.635 --> 00:52:37.320
you always use the
Heisenberg picture.

00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:40.780
We don't talk about
wave function.

00:52:40.780 --> 00:52:44.190
But this equivalent formulation
of, of course, quantum

00:52:44.190 --> 00:52:47.970
fields theory, which you can
just talk about wave functional

00:52:47.970 --> 00:52:53.160
and talk about it in terms
of the Schrodinger picture.

00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:55.591
So for example, let me just
consider a scalar field's

00:52:55.591 --> 00:52:56.090
theory.

00:53:11.710 --> 00:53:23.800
Then the Hilbert space,
the configuration space,

00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:30.200
of this theory of this
system is just phi x.

00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:33.370
You validate it at
some given time.

00:53:33.370 --> 00:53:37.340
Say, you validate it at t
equals to 0, for example.

00:53:37.340 --> 00:53:38.670
So let me just write it as 5x.

00:53:45.850 --> 00:53:48.040
The configuration space
is just all possibles

00:53:48.040 --> 00:53:55.850
of phi defining
the spatial slice.

00:53:55.850 --> 00:54:00.100
OK, so this your configuration
space for the quantum

00:54:00.100 --> 00:54:01.750
fields theory.

00:54:01.750 --> 00:54:11.030
And the Hilbert
space of the system

00:54:11.030 --> 00:54:18.080
just given by all
possible y functionals

00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:20.520
of this configuration
space variables.

00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:30.220
So if you feel this is a
little bit too abstract to you,

00:54:30.220 --> 00:54:36.420
then just think of
space is discrete,

00:54:36.420 --> 00:54:41.390
and then you can just write
this as some discrete set

00:54:41.390 --> 00:54:44.530
of variables that
them become identical

00:54:44.530 --> 00:54:46.300
to the ordinary quantum system.

00:54:52.580 --> 00:54:58.490
So two things to remind
you, two more things.

00:54:58.490 --> 00:55:02.080
First, just as in
quantum mechanics,

00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:10.760
if you ask the value
of, say, a time t2,

00:55:10.760 --> 00:55:13.080
you are in the [INAUDIBLE]
state of this phi,

00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:16.390
this [INAUDIBLE]
value phi 2 and the

00:55:16.390 --> 00:55:24.200
overlap we said t1 in the
[INAUDIBLE] state of phi,

00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:26.500
this [INAUDIBLE] value phi 1.

00:55:26.500 --> 00:55:31.030
This is given by a path
integral [? d ?] phi.

00:55:40.700 --> 00:55:45.420
You integrate with the
following boundary condition.

00:56:05.720 --> 00:56:08.500
And actually, just
[INAUDIBLE] for this theory.

00:56:15.610 --> 00:56:21.599
In particular, by taking
a linear of this formula,

00:56:21.599 --> 00:56:23.640
one can write down a path
integral representation

00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:28.150
of the vacuum wave function.

00:56:34.530 --> 00:56:45.950
So the vacuum wave
function, in this case,

00:56:45.950 --> 00:56:49.790
will be very functional.

00:56:49.790 --> 00:56:53.850
[INAUDIBLE], so if you
have a vacuum state,

00:56:53.850 --> 00:56:55.670
then you just
consider the overlap

00:56:55.670 --> 00:57:00.210
with the vacuum to your
configuration space variable.

00:57:00.210 --> 00:57:06.110
So I will denote
it by phi 0 phi x.

00:57:06.110 --> 00:57:07.730
This is the vacuum.

00:57:07.730 --> 00:57:14.910
And this has a path
integral [INAUDIBLE]

00:57:14.910 --> 00:57:18.620
is that you
compactify your time.

00:57:18.620 --> 00:57:22.280
OK, so it's where this
is your real time,

00:57:22.280 --> 00:57:26.796
and this is your imaginary
time, which I call t e.

00:57:29.390 --> 00:57:33.090
You compactify your time.

00:57:33.090 --> 00:57:40.795
And then integrate the
path integral or back

00:57:40.795 --> 00:57:43.790
to imaginary time.

00:57:43.790 --> 00:57:50.160
So this can be written from the
path integral as t phi t e x.

00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:57.880
So you go to Euclidean, the but
integrate all t's more than 0

00:57:57.880 --> 00:58:02.536
with the boundary
condition te equal to 0x.

00:58:02.536 --> 00:58:07.590
You can do phi x, and
your Euclidean action.

00:58:12.770 --> 00:58:16.732
OK, I hope you're
familiar with this.

00:58:16.732 --> 00:58:20.160
This is where we obtain the
vacuum [INAUDIBLE] function.

00:58:24.470 --> 00:58:26.950
So if this is not for me
to [INAUDIBLE] say, well,

00:58:26.950 --> 00:58:31.340
how do you get to
the wave function

00:58:31.340 --> 00:58:35.390
of a harmonic oscillator in
the vacuum from path integral?

00:58:38.160 --> 00:58:39.124
Yes?

00:58:39.124 --> 00:58:40.040
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:58:48.210 --> 00:58:50.739
PROFESSOR: You will
see it in a few minutes

00:58:50.739 --> 00:58:52.405
because I'm going to
use those formulas.

00:58:59.840 --> 00:59:00.630
Yes?

00:59:00.630 --> 00:59:02.180
AUDIENCE: So one
question is that

00:59:02.180 --> 00:59:06.582
what is the analog of the
wave equation for the wave

00:59:06.582 --> 00:59:07.760
functional?

00:59:07.760 --> 00:59:09.630
Like what is the
[INAUDIBLE] equation

00:59:09.630 --> 00:59:11.430
for the wave functional?

00:59:11.430 --> 00:59:13.150
PROFESSOR: The same thing.

00:59:13.150 --> 00:59:17.486
i [? partial ?] t
phi equal to H phi.

00:59:17.486 --> 00:59:19.571
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:59:19.571 --> 00:59:21.820
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it just has
more [INAUDIBLE] freedom.

00:59:21.820 --> 00:59:24.298
The quantum mechanics
works the same.

00:59:24.298 --> 00:59:26.567
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:59:26.567 --> 00:59:28.150
PROFESSOR: So is
this familiar to you?

00:59:28.150 --> 00:59:31.660
If not familiar
to you, I urge you

00:59:31.660 --> 00:59:34.449
to think about the case
of a harmonic oscillator.

00:59:34.449 --> 00:59:36.490
For the harmonic oscillator,
that will be the way

00:59:36.490 --> 00:59:42.090
you obtain the ground state wave
function from the path integral

00:59:42.090 --> 00:59:43.530
is that you first
need to continue

00:59:43.530 --> 00:59:46.120
the system to the Euclidean.

00:59:46.120 --> 00:59:50.380
And they integrate the path
integral all the way from minus

00:59:50.380 --> 00:59:55.530
Euclidean time equal to infinity
to Euclidean time equal to 0.

00:59:55.530 --> 00:59:59.540
Let me just write down the--
so the standard of quantum

00:59:59.540 --> 01:00:04.830
mechanics if you want to right
down to the ground state wave

01:00:04.830 --> 01:00:09.710
function, so that's what you do.

01:00:09.710 --> 01:00:12.240
Again, you go to
the path integral.

01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:20.250
You go to go to
Euclidean, and you really

01:00:20.250 --> 01:00:25.150
integrate of all
tE smaller than 0.

01:00:25.150 --> 01:00:27.850
And with the boundary condition
that x [? evaluated ?]

01:00:27.850 --> 01:00:33.590
at tE equal to tE
equal to 0 equal to x.

01:00:33.590 --> 01:00:36.331
So that gives you
the wave function,

01:00:36.331 --> 01:00:37.497
gives you the wave function.

01:00:40.700 --> 01:00:46.290
OK, now with this
preparation, that's

01:00:46.290 --> 01:00:49.220
just some ordinary
quantum mechanics.

01:00:49.220 --> 01:00:51.370
And this is a
generalization of that

01:00:51.370 --> 01:00:54.675
to quantum fields theory
just replace that x by 5.

01:01:00.090 --> 01:01:02.150
Good, so now let's
go back to prove

01:01:02.150 --> 01:01:07.960
the statement we claim you're
going to prove, this one, OK?

01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:10.611
So now let's come back.

01:01:10.611 --> 01:01:13.070
So we finished our preparation.

01:01:13.070 --> 01:01:15.620
Now come back to Rindler space.

01:01:25.060 --> 01:01:27.575
So it is considered scalar
field theory, for example.

01:01:30.670 --> 01:01:34.200
So let me just remind you,
again, this Rindler-- so

01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:37.890
write down some
key formulas here--

01:01:37.890 --> 01:01:48.820
so Rindler is the right quadrant
of the Minkowski time, which is

01:01:48.820 --> 01:01:51.220
separated by this right column.

01:01:51.220 --> 01:01:57.450
Suppose this is X. This is
T. Then Minkowski [INAUDIBLE]

01:01:57.450 --> 01:02:01.591
is minus dT squared
plus dX squared.

01:02:01.591 --> 01:02:08.060
And then the Rindler path
is minus rho squared to eta

01:02:08.060 --> 01:02:13.120
squared plus the rho squared.

01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:15.165
And so this is the
rho equal to constant.

01:02:18.700 --> 01:02:20.505
And this is the eta
equal to constant.

01:02:23.410 --> 01:02:27.210
And here is eta equal
to minus infinity.

01:02:27.210 --> 01:02:30.530
So here is eta equal
to plus infinity.

01:02:30.530 --> 01:02:33.400
So spacetime foliates
like this, OK?

01:02:36.410 --> 01:02:50.240
And when we go to Euclidean
signature for the Minkowski,

01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:54.654
of course, it's just
T goes to minus iTE.

01:02:54.654 --> 01:02:57.420
So I call this Euclidean time.

01:02:57.420 --> 01:03:03.765
For the Rindler, I
will do minus i theta.

01:03:03.765 --> 01:03:04.890
This is my notation before.

01:03:21.630 --> 01:03:35.080
So in the Euclidean signature,
the standard Minkowski

01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:39.010
just becomes TE squared
plus the dX squared.

01:03:39.010 --> 01:03:45.470
And then this Rindler
is just rho squared

01:03:45.470 --> 01:03:47.670
[? to ?] theta squared
plus the rho squared.

01:03:52.550 --> 01:03:58.550
In particular, this
theta identified

01:03:58.550 --> 01:04:00.805
to be plus period 2pi.

01:04:04.530 --> 01:04:19.220
The Euclidean, under
the continuation

01:04:19.220 --> 01:04:26.920
of Minkowski and Rindler,
are actually identical.

01:04:36.740 --> 01:04:44.926
Both of them are the full
two-dimensional Euclidean

01:04:44.926 --> 01:04:45.425
space.

01:04:48.020 --> 01:04:50.000
So if you do the standard
of the Minkowski,

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:51.945
just replace X by TE.

01:04:54.510 --> 01:05:03.240
But for the Rindler, you
just replace it by rho theta.

01:05:08.010 --> 01:05:11.130
So they just go one into
a different foliation,

01:05:11.130 --> 01:05:14.270
and this goes one
into the [INAUDIBLE].

01:05:14.270 --> 01:05:18.170
And this one is bound for
the Cartesian coordinate.

01:05:18.170 --> 01:05:22.100
So the remarkable
thing is that even

01:05:22.100 --> 01:05:25.915
in the Lorentzian signature,
the Rindler is only part

01:05:25.915 --> 01:05:27.210
of the Minkowski spacetime.

01:05:30.130 --> 01:05:37.010
But once you go to Euclidean,
if you do this identification

01:05:37.010 --> 01:05:41.030
theta cos theta plus 2pi, they
have exactly the same Euclidean

01:05:41.030 --> 01:05:43.920
manifold, just identical.

01:05:48.950 --> 01:05:50.800
So this immediately
means one thing.

01:05:54.800 --> 01:06:08.370
It's that all the
Euclidean observables just

01:06:08.370 --> 01:06:10.120
with the trivial
coordinate transformation

01:06:10.120 --> 01:06:17.040
from the Cartesian to
the polar coordinates,

01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:25.580
all the Euclidean observables
are identical in two theories.

01:06:30.450 --> 01:06:32.770
AUDIENCE: What is that down
there, "are identical?"

01:06:32.770 --> 01:06:35.580
What's R sub E squared?

01:06:35.580 --> 01:06:38.370
PROFESSOR: Yeah, this just means
the Euclidean two-dimensional

01:06:38.370 --> 01:06:40.620
spacetime.

01:06:40.620 --> 01:06:41.577
AUDIENCE: Oh, I see.

01:06:41.577 --> 01:06:43.160
PROFESSOR: Yeah, let
me just right it.

01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:48.830
This is R subscript E squared 2.

01:06:48.830 --> 01:06:51.940
So this is just a
two-dimensional Euclidean

01:06:51.940 --> 01:06:52.440
space.

01:07:02.390 --> 01:07:05.020
So from here, we
can immediately lead

01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:14.586
to the conclusion we said
earlier because for Minkowski--

01:07:14.586 --> 01:07:16.460
say, if you compute the
Euclidean correlation

01:07:16.460 --> 01:07:20.280
functions, and then [INAUDIBLE]
to the Lorentzian signature,

01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:23.710
what you get is that
you get the correlation

01:07:23.710 --> 01:07:26.660
function in the standard
Minkowski vacuum.

01:07:29.730 --> 01:07:39.320
So for Minkowski and
then back to Lorentzian,

01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:48.700
so the typical observables--
so Euclidean, say,

01:07:48.700 --> 01:07:58.550
correlation functions just
goes to correlation functions

01:07:58.550 --> 01:08:02.330
in the standard
Minkowski vacuum, OK?

01:08:07.170 --> 01:08:14.503
Yeah, this is just trivial
QFT in your high school.

01:08:14.503 --> 01:08:20.279
[LAUGHTER]

01:08:20.279 --> 01:08:27.140
But with this top statement,
we reach a very [INAUDIBLE]

01:08:27.140 --> 01:08:35.149
conclusion is that for Rindler,
when you go back to Lorentzian

01:08:35.149 --> 01:08:41.090
signature, then that
tells you for the Rindler

01:08:41.090 --> 01:08:42.880
when you do that
[INAUDIBLE] continuation

01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:46.370
and back to the Lorentzian
signature, what do you get?

01:08:46.370 --> 01:08:56.970
It's that you get a
correlation function

01:08:56.970 --> 01:09:00.000
in the standard
Minkowski vacuum.

01:09:06.750 --> 01:09:24.560
But for observables,
restricted to Rindler

01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:26.740
because it's the same thing.

01:09:26.740 --> 01:09:29.640
It's just the same function
when we do a [? continuation, ?]

01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:31.689
just you do it differently.

01:09:31.689 --> 01:09:34.000
It's just on the
continuation procedure,

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:35.180
it's a little bit different.

01:09:35.180 --> 01:09:37.680
And a way to go into
Rindler, you just

01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:41.260
get observable restriction
to the Rindler path.

01:09:41.260 --> 01:09:44.560
So the Euclidean things
are exactly the same.

01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:49.660
So that tells you that the
corresponding Lorentzian

01:09:49.660 --> 01:09:53.700
Rindler correlation function
is the same as the correlation

01:09:53.700 --> 01:09:56.180
function in the standard
Minkowski vacuum,

01:09:56.180 --> 01:10:00.120
but you just restrict
to the Rindler patch.

01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:03.020
OK, now is our final step.

01:10:06.590 --> 01:10:09.950
So now let's talk a bit
more about the structure

01:10:09.950 --> 01:10:10.855
of the Hilbert space.

01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:17.015
So now I have to
derive the temperature,

01:10:17.015 --> 01:10:20.904
but somehow in the Minkowski,
there's no temperature.

01:10:20.904 --> 01:10:22.070
Here there's no temperature.

01:10:22.070 --> 01:10:25.210
It's T equal to 0
from your high school.

01:10:25.210 --> 01:10:28.830
And here, we must
see a temperature.

01:10:28.830 --> 01:10:31.900
So where does this
temperature come from?

01:10:31.900 --> 01:10:35.580
So now let's look a little bit
at the structure of the Hilbert

01:10:35.580 --> 01:10:37.000
space.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:40.620
So using that picture-- so let
me write here-- so the Hilbert

01:10:40.620 --> 01:10:45.170
space of the Rindler-- so this
is all not in the Lorentzian

01:10:45.170 --> 01:10:47.870
picture.

01:10:47.870 --> 01:10:49.680
So the Hilbert
space in the Rindler

01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:54.580
is essentially all possible
square integrable wave

01:10:54.580 --> 01:11:02.740
functional of the phi, which
defines in the right patch.

01:11:02.740 --> 01:11:06.210
So when we define
this wave functional,

01:11:06.210 --> 01:11:08.569
we verify at the
single time slice.

01:11:08.569 --> 01:11:10.360
So that's evaluated at
a slice which is eta

01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:11.850
equal to 0, which is just here.

01:11:14.830 --> 01:11:28.640
So with phi R is essentially
just phi for x greater than 0

01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:29.715
and the T equal to 0.

01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:41.630
This is the right
half of the real axis.

01:11:41.630 --> 01:11:46.150
So this is a Hilbert
space of the Rindler.

01:11:46.150 --> 01:11:49.060
And, of course, we can also
write down the Hamiltonian

01:11:49.060 --> 01:11:55.490
for the Rindler respect to eta.

01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:01.630
So this is called the
Rindler Hamiltonian.

01:12:01.630 --> 01:12:05.630
And as I said before, you
can quantize this here unit,

01:12:05.630 --> 01:12:11.316
this Hamiltonian, then
you will get-- say,

01:12:11.316 --> 01:12:12.690
you can quantize
this Hamiltonian

01:12:12.690 --> 01:12:15.640
to construct all the excited
states, so to me just label

01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:18.080
them by n.

01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:34.180
So I say, this complete
set of eigenstate for HR,

01:12:34.180 --> 01:12:37.750
so the second
value will say, En.

01:12:37.750 --> 01:12:40.570
OK, you can just
quantize it, then

01:12:40.570 --> 01:12:42.000
you can find your full state.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:46.002
In particular, the ground
state, when you do that,

01:12:46.002 --> 01:12:47.460
is what we call
the Rindler vacuum.

01:12:50.590 --> 01:12:54.140
We said before that if you
just to straightforward

01:12:54.140 --> 01:12:58.820
canonical connotation, you
get the Rindler vacuum, which

01:12:58.820 --> 01:13:02.190
is different from the vacuum
which we identify theta by 2pi.

01:13:02.190 --> 01:13:08.870
And this we just straightforward
quantize respect to eta.

01:13:08.870 --> 01:13:10.570
So now let's go back.

01:13:10.570 --> 01:13:14.290
So this is a structure
of the Hilbert space

01:13:14.290 --> 01:13:17.590
in some sense for this Rindler.

01:13:30.030 --> 01:13:34.430
So now let's look at the
Hilbert space for the Minkowski.

01:13:37.310 --> 01:13:40.310
So Minkowski is defined--
by Minkowski, I mean,

01:13:40.310 --> 01:13:43.180
the theory defined for
the whole Minkowski

01:13:43.180 --> 01:13:47.900
spacetime is this T. Quantize
with respect to this T.

01:13:47.900 --> 01:13:53.555
So this would be just
standard psi phi x.

01:13:56.960 --> 01:14:02.990
Now this x can be
anything, and then

01:14:02.990 --> 01:14:05.940
we also have a Minkowski
Hamiltonian defined

01:14:05.940 --> 01:14:11.810
with respect to T,
to capital T. OK,

01:14:11.810 --> 01:14:14.700
so this is the standard of
the Minkowski Hamiltonian.

01:14:14.700 --> 01:14:18.070
And then the vacuum, which
I denote to be the Minkowski

01:14:18.070 --> 01:14:33.140
vacuum is M. And then vacuum
functional phi x is just phi

01:14:33.140 --> 01:14:42.800
x 0 M.

01:14:42.800 --> 01:15:01.870
So now the key
observation here is

01:15:01.870 --> 01:15:10.940
at phi x, which this phi x
is for the full real axis,

01:15:10.940 --> 01:15:12.850
for the full horizontal axis.

01:15:12.850 --> 01:15:15.200
So this is in some
[? contained ?]

01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:20.450
phi Lx and the phi Rx.

01:15:20.450 --> 01:15:22.460
This goes one into
the variable of phi.

01:15:22.460 --> 01:15:25.730
You [? variate ?] it
to the right patch,

01:15:25.730 --> 01:15:29.725
and the value you've
added to the left patch.

01:15:29.725 --> 01:15:34.440
So the space of phi x,
it's the combination

01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:38.370
of space of phi L x for the
left part and space for the phi

01:15:38.370 --> 01:15:39.127
right part.

01:15:42.011 --> 01:15:48.936
In particular, this tells us
the Minkowski Hilbert space,

01:15:48.936 --> 01:15:53.740
which is defined as a
functional of this full phi x,

01:15:53.740 --> 01:15:58.270
should be the tensor
product of the Rindler

01:15:58.270 --> 01:16:05.700
to the right tensor product
of the Rindler to the left.

01:16:05.700 --> 01:16:08.980
Notice that we talk
about this right Rindler,

01:16:08.980 --> 01:16:13.550
but there's a similar
Rindler to the left,

01:16:13.550 --> 01:16:18.180
but the structure of the
Minkowski space or Hilbert

01:16:18.180 --> 01:16:21.610
space, it's the tensor
product of the two.

01:16:21.610 --> 01:16:28.110
In particular, this ground
state wave functional,

01:16:28.110 --> 01:16:31.610
you can write it as
phi Lx and phi Rx.

01:16:35.220 --> 01:16:37.510
So this ground
state way functional

01:16:37.510 --> 01:16:42.450
should also be understood
as the functional for phi L.

01:16:42.450 --> 01:16:46.620
OK, so now here is my last key.

01:17:06.042 --> 01:17:07.410
And here is last key.

01:17:10.270 --> 01:17:15.180
So remember, the ground
state wave function

01:17:15.180 --> 01:17:23.870
will be obtained by doing path
integral on the Euclidean half

01:17:23.870 --> 01:17:24.380
plane.

01:17:24.380 --> 01:17:26.360
So T is smaller than 0, OK?

01:17:30.260 --> 01:17:38.930
So let me just draw the
Euclidean space again, X, TE.

01:17:38.930 --> 01:17:47.530
So the wave function
can be written

01:17:47.530 --> 01:18:10.140
as define [? tE ?] x [INAUDIBLE]
minus SE Euclidean action.

01:18:10.140 --> 01:18:14.420
And the lower half plane
of the Euclidean space

01:18:14.420 --> 01:18:21.700
with the boundary
condition-- OK,

01:18:21.700 --> 01:18:26.540
remember from path
integral, that's

01:18:26.540 --> 01:18:29.910
how you obtain the-- so that
means you integrate over

01:18:29.910 --> 01:18:33.400
all this region, path integral
over all of this region.

01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:36.590
Then with boundary
condition fixed at here,

01:18:36.590 --> 01:18:41.576
we do this path integral, you
get the Minkowski vacuum wave

01:18:41.576 --> 01:18:42.075
function.

01:18:48.420 --> 01:18:51.670
Now here is the key.

01:18:51.670 --> 01:18:56.360
So this half space, when
I write in this form,

01:18:56.360 --> 01:19:01.470
you treat this T as
the time, but now let's

01:19:01.470 --> 01:19:03.630
consider a different foliation.

01:19:03.630 --> 01:19:06.060
I don't have colored chalk here.

01:19:06.060 --> 01:19:08.920
I can consider a
different foliaton.

01:19:08.920 --> 01:19:10.670
It's that foliation
in terms of the theta.

01:19:14.650 --> 01:19:18.080
Then you just have
this foliation,

01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:23.320
so for each value of
theta, you have a rho.

01:19:23.320 --> 01:19:27.810
So integration for
minus theta to theta.

01:19:27.810 --> 01:19:31.190
So if you think about
from this foliaion-- so

01:19:31.190 --> 01:19:33.810
think about from this foliation,
then this path integral

01:19:33.810 --> 01:19:42.430
can be written as a
following, D phi theta

01:19:42.430 --> 01:19:52.850
rho, which you fix phi
theta equal to minus pi rho.

01:19:52.850 --> 01:19:57.110
Rho here when theta equal
to minus pi becomes x,

01:19:57.110 --> 01:19:58.115
you could do phi Lx.

01:20:04.860 --> 01:20:09.220
And the phi theta
equal to pi-- theta

01:20:09.220 --> 01:20:22.790
equal to 0rho equal to phi
Rx and exponential minus S,

01:20:22.790 --> 01:20:26.000
so these two should be the same.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.370
I just chose the
different foliation

01:20:28.370 --> 01:20:29.500
to do my path integral.

01:20:34.210 --> 01:20:42.130
But now if you think
from this point of view,

01:20:42.130 --> 01:20:51.100
this a precisely like that
because theta 0 and theta

01:20:51.100 --> 01:20:54.320
minus pi are just two
different times in terms

01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:57.015
of this Euclidean Rindler time.

01:20:59.900 --> 01:21:06.700
So this you can write it as phi,
so let me write one more step.

01:21:06.700 --> 01:21:09.560
So this can written
as phi2 [INAUDIBLE]

01:21:09.560 --> 01:21:14.770
minus iH t2 minus t1 phi1.

01:21:21.870 --> 01:21:26.750
So this last step
can be now written

01:21:26.750 --> 01:21:42.901
as I can think in
terms of the time

01:21:42.901 --> 01:21:49.140
within the Rindler
of time, this can

01:21:49.140 --> 01:21:59.140
be written as phi R
exponential minus i minus i

01:21:59.140 --> 01:22:06.940
pi because we have a Euclidean
time H Rindler Hamiltonian phi

01:22:06.940 --> 01:22:08.790
L, OK?

01:22:15.160 --> 01:22:23.606
So this tells me that
Minkowski wave functional

01:22:23.606 --> 01:22:26.650
can be written as
the following-- can

01:22:26.650 --> 01:22:40.310
be written as phi R
exponential pi HR phi L.

01:22:40.310 --> 01:22:51.790
So now let me expand this in the
complete set of states of HR.

01:22:51.790 --> 01:22:57.335
Then this is sum of
n, so if you expand

01:22:57.335 --> 01:23:00.905
in terms of a complete
[INAUDIBLE] to HR,

01:23:00.905 --> 01:23:02.530
then this is, [? say, ?]
wave function.

01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:24.440
So with this chi n equal
to chi n phi equal to phi.

01:23:24.440 --> 01:23:29.040
So remember, this n is defined
from this Rindler Hamiltonian.

01:23:34.840 --> 01:23:36.270
Now let me erase this.

01:23:41.380 --> 01:23:44.580
So I can slightly rewrite
this because I don't

01:23:44.580 --> 01:23:47.310
like this complex conjugate.

01:23:47.310 --> 01:23:48.886
I can slightly rewrite this.

01:23:52.550 --> 01:24:03.170
It's thi0 phi x is equal to sum
over n [? and then ?] minus pi

01:24:03.170 --> 01:24:11.690
En chi n phi R and
the chi and tilde

01:24:11.690 --> 01:24:25.790
phi L. So chi and tilde define
to be phi and star phi L.

01:24:25.790 --> 01:24:31.130
So this chi and tilde
can be considered--

01:24:31.130 --> 01:24:35.430
just like in ordinary
quantum mechanics,

01:24:35.430 --> 01:24:42.160
this can be considered to belong
to a slightly different Rindler

01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:55.770
Hilbert space whose time
duration is opposite.

01:24:55.770 --> 01:25:01.140
So when you switch
the direction of time,

01:25:01.140 --> 01:25:05.550
you put a complex conjugate.

01:25:05.550 --> 01:25:07.140
So this complex
conjugate can also

01:25:07.140 --> 01:25:11.910
be thought of just as a wave
function in the Hilbert space

01:25:11.910 --> 01:25:14.750
with the opposite
time direction,

01:25:14.750 --> 01:25:19.930
with opposite to the
Rindler we started with,

01:25:19.930 --> 01:25:25.398
to the right patch Rindler.

01:25:35.090 --> 01:25:39.940
So now this form is exactly
the form we have seen before.

01:25:39.940 --> 01:25:43.175
In this [INAUDIBLE] way to
think about thermal state.

01:25:46.690 --> 01:25:56.700
So this is exactly that
because this tells you

01:25:56.700 --> 01:26:00.310
that the Cartesian in
the Minkowski vacuum

01:26:00.310 --> 01:26:04.490
is the sum of
expression minus pi

01:26:04.490 --> 01:26:12.550
En with n Rindler of 1 patch
[? tensor ?] and Rindler

01:26:12.550 --> 01:26:14.962
of the other one.

01:26:14.962 --> 01:26:16.420
So this or the
other Rindler should

01:26:16.420 --> 01:26:19.510
be considered
Rindler of the left

01:26:19.510 --> 01:26:23.790
except we should quantize the
theory with the opposite time

01:26:23.790 --> 01:26:30.745
direction, which gives you this
Rindler tilde Rindler left.

01:26:33.880 --> 01:26:40.020
So this is just precisely
the structure we saw before.

01:26:40.020 --> 01:26:42.860
In particular, if
you are ignorant

01:26:42.860 --> 01:26:46.670
about the left
Rindler, you can just

01:26:46.670 --> 01:27:00.850
trace it out, trace out the left
part of this ground state wave

01:27:00.850 --> 01:27:03.310
function.

01:27:03.310 --> 01:27:10.720
Then, of course, you
just get rho Rindler,

01:27:10.720 --> 01:27:14.320
the thermal density
matrix in the Rindler.

01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:22.920
And this is equal to, of course,
1 over Rindler exponential

01:27:22.920 --> 01:27:24.350
minus 2pi HR.

01:27:28.470 --> 01:27:35.110
And we see that the
beta is equal to 2pi,

01:27:35.110 --> 01:27:37.120
but this is the beta
associated with eta.

01:27:41.680 --> 01:27:45.210
As we said, when you change
to a different observer,

01:27:45.210 --> 01:27:48.360
a different rho, then you have
to go to the local proper time.

01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:50.240
But this is precisely
what we found before.

01:27:59.720 --> 01:28:06.810
So now we understand that the
thermal nature of this Rindler

01:28:06.810 --> 01:28:12.190
observer is just precisely that
because this observer cannot

01:28:12.190 --> 01:28:17.590
access the physics
to the left patch.

01:28:17.590 --> 01:28:21.910
But the vacuum state of
the Minkowski spacetime

01:28:21.910 --> 01:28:26.140
is an entangled state between
the left and the right.

01:28:26.140 --> 01:28:28.590
And when you trace
out the left part,

01:28:28.590 --> 01:28:31.575
then you get a similar
state on the right part,

01:28:31.575 --> 01:28:33.075
so that's how the
temperature rises.

01:28:36.561 --> 01:28:38.810
And the same thing can be
said about black hole, which

01:28:38.810 --> 01:28:40.640
we'll say a little
bit more next lecture.

01:28:40.640 --> 01:28:42.487
And let's stop here.
