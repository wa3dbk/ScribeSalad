00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.670
HONG LIU: So last time we
talked about what corresponding

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:35.790
to external fundamental
quark in [INAUDIBLE] series.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:50.970
So you can see there [? m ?]
plus 1 is [? rebrain. ?] Then

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:52.410
you separate one of them.

00:00:58.919 --> 00:00:59.960
You separate one of them.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:10.496
And then you can see there
one string connect between,

00:01:10.496 --> 00:01:12.370
then you can see that
the open string connect

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.035
between this [? m ?] and this 1.

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:21.960
And such object from
the point of view,

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.040
because this end
have a unique index.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.360
And this end have indices.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.950
So this will transform
on the fundamental

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.330
[? representation ?]
of this SU(N).

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.940
Because when you're reshuffling
the indices of this [? n, ?]

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.650
and this will
transform as a vector,

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:46.190
because there's only one
end [INAUDIBLE] on it.

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.215
So this is the field
series picture.

00:01:49.215 --> 00:01:52.760
Then in the gravity
picture, when

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.090
you go to AdS, so when
you take a [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.390
in the gravity side, then
this M-Brain just disappeared.

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.580
And then you have
a boundary, say

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.090
i equal to infinity,
or z equal to 0.

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.170
And then you find in
a suitable [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.970
that the single brain
still remains there.

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.460
And then this string
become a string

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:25.280
just an ending on this
brain, but extend all the way

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.260
to i equal to 0.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.910
Because all the other
end, this [? rebrain ?]

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.730
not disappeared, but
replaced by the geometry.

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.850
So now what you find
in the gravity side,

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.040
this just become
a single D-Brain,

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:46.250
single [? D ?] [? rebrain ?] now
in the AdS 5 Now in the AdS 5.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.930
And there's one point on the S5.

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.250
So depending on the direction.

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.530
So this will be extended
in some direction,

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.200
in the transverse direction,
to this [? rebrain. ?]

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.010
And so that direction
determines the point on the S5.

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.960
So we're relying on the
single point on the S5.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.700
And all this special
dimension is parallel

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.310
to the boundary direction.

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.700
So this, is the geometry clear?

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.450
Good.

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.870
And now if we want, you can
see the external quark which

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.390
have infinite
mass, then you want

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.760
to put this brain
to the boundary,

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.730
because the mass of this quark
is controlled by the length.

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.490
So you want this
length go to infinite.

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:26.070
Then you put it to the boundary.

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.040
And, yeah.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.480
Essentially.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:42.310
So this picture tells
you that the external

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:51.670
quark in [INAUDIBLE] theory.

00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:03.110
Then you just mapped to a
string ending on the boundary.

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.080
A string ending on the boundary.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.150
Do you have any questions
regarding this picture?

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.329
And the mass of the string,
as we discussed before,

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:29.950
either from this picture
the mass of the string

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.218
would be the length divided
by 2 pi alpha prime.

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.800
And that this mass getting
[INAUDIBLE] to this picture.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.140
And then you can check it
as a self-consistency check

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:48.280
that the straight string
extend all the way say

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.060
from some radius,
from some location r,

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.160
to the i equal to 0, and
precisely have this mass.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.175
So now let me make a note.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.700
So as we said before, if
you say an ordinary [? K ?]

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.650
[? series ?], if you
take an external quark,

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:21.140
say moving in the fundamental
[? representation. ?] And when

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:26.220
you parallel transport that
quark say along some loop,

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.460
then you get the Wilson loop.

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.320
Then you get the Wilson loop.

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.940
But in this case, the
parallel transport

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:52.116
of this m of such
an external quark

00:05:52.116 --> 00:05:53.490
actually gives
something which is

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:57.950
slightly different from
the standard Wilson loop.

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:00.405
So at the standard Wilson
loop is the following.

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:11.270
It's you take the trace,
[? your ?] path order,

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:17.610
and the exponential--
say i, A mu,

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:24.120
say supposed S parameterize
the length along the path.

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.930
And then you have A mu.

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:29.101
And then you have dx mu ds.

00:06:29.101 --> 00:06:30.600
So this is the
standard Wilson loop.

00:06:32.785 --> 00:06:34.660
But in this case, actually
you have something

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:38.094
more in the exponential
for the following reason.

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:45.300
So in the [INAUDIBLE]
series, you'll

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:46.477
not only have a gate field.

00:06:46.477 --> 00:06:47.810
You'll also have a scalar field.

00:06:50.339 --> 00:06:52.130
As we [? stated ?]
before, the scalar field

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:57.890
parameterizes the
external fluctuation

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:02.100
in the transverse
direction of the D-Brains.

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:09.180
So now if you imagine you have a
string ending on such D-Brains,

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:12.550
just by mechanical thinking,
really mechanical thinking,

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:15.190
if you have something
ending on the D-Brain,

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:17.360
and if this thing
have a mass, and it

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:20.690
got to pull this D-Brain
in the direction.

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:23.490
Because this thing have a
[? finite ?] [? tension. ?] So

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:25.130
you want to pull the D-Brain.

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:28.520
So that means that
the string actually

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:31.790
will deform as a shape
of the D-Brain around

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:33.270
at the ending point.

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:36.340
So what that means is
that the string should

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:39.320
couple to the scalar
field on the D-Brain.

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:41.826
Such open string should
couple to the scalar

00:07:41.826 --> 00:07:42.700
field on the D-Brain.

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:45.535
The scalar field paramertize
the transfer direction

00:07:45.535 --> 00:07:47.440
and the transfer motion.

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:49.820
And the string should
pull the D-Brain.

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:57.880
So this open string got to
couple to the scalar fields.

00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:59.620
So this is a rough
[? infusion. ?]

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:04.520
But you can work
this out explicitly.

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:06.110
You just take this series.

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:10.580
So this is SU(N)
[INAUDIBLE] series, N + 1,

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:11.580
your [INAUDIBLE] series.

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:14.690
And then you break
to SU (N) times u(1).

00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:19.300
So this open string
goes bounding

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:21.980
to the off diagonal
degree of freedom,

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:25.960
of going into this breaking
between the N and the 1,

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:28.299
and corresponding to explicit
field in this series.

00:08:28.299 --> 00:08:30.840
And you can just work out the
[? dynamically ?] of the field.

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:32.770
You can usually check
that actually this

00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:33.980
coupled to the scalar field.

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:36.740
So I will not go
into detail there.

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:40.960
But you can work
out more explicitly.

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:45.430
So the bottom line
is that such objects,

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:48.210
we are not only coupled
to the gate field,

00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:51.430
but also coupled to
the scalar fields.

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:54.190
And if you work
it out explicit;y,

00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:56.550
it will couple to the scalar
field in the following way.

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:05.374
So a limit you not [? define. ?]
So you have six scalar fields.

00:09:05.374 --> 00:09:06.665
Let me denote them as a vector.

00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:16.190
Yeah.

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:19.760
So now let me explain
this notation.

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:22.770
So this n essentially the
direction of the string.

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:33.430
So n is a unit
vector on S 5, which

00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:35.550
is a location of
that D-Brain, which

00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:37.185
is enabled the location
of this D-Brain

00:09:37.185 --> 00:09:42.170
is 5, because it's in
some transverse direction.

00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:49.550
And the 5 is just the
six scalar fields,

00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:53.920
which I writed the vector, six
fields of [INAUDIBLE] series.

00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:02.090
And then the dot x squared is
just the modulus of this guy.

00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:06.350
You have any questions on this?

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:11.550
So now, because this is the
Wilson loop corresponding

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:16.540
to such an external quark.

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:21.540
And actually, when you
consider the string dynamics

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:23.286
on the gravity
side, that we will

00:10:23.286 --> 00:10:25.160
relate to the expectation
value, for example,

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:26.970
of this Wilson loop.

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:28.152
Not the standard one.

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:56.385
So now let's consider such
a quark traverses some path

00:10:56.385 --> 00:11:02.500
C, some loop C on the boundary.

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:15.377
So I will make two statements.

00:11:15.377 --> 00:11:16.960
And from these two
statements, then we

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:19.150
will be able to
guess what the Wilson

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:22.660
loop will be corresponding
to on the gravity sides.

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:32.388
So the first statement
is that this quark,

00:11:32.388 --> 00:11:47.110
lies under the endpoint
of a string in AdS.

00:11:54.740 --> 00:12:02.470
So that means the C-- so the
loop formed by this quark

00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:21.750
trajectory, there must be the
boundary of the corresponding

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:29.570
string [? worksheet. ?] So let
me call this [? worksheet ?]

00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:32.070
sigma.

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:36.380
So in other words, the
C must be corresponding

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:37.660
to the boundary of the sigma.

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:56.760
So the second statement is
that the expectation value

00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:01.360
of the Wilson loop-- so this can
see considered as the partition

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:13.560
function of this quark system.

00:13:22.384 --> 00:13:24.800
So you can think about the
expectation value of the Wilson

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:26.280
loop as the following.

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:28.830
So you take the quark, and
write down the path integral

00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:30.720
for this quark.

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:34.630
Write down the path of
the quark along this loop,

00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:43.550
and then just integrate all
of the dynamics of the quark.

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:51.020
And then what you remaining
would be just the Wilson loop.

00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:54.982
So you can just imagine this
Wilson loop corresponding

00:13:54.982 --> 00:13:56.940
to the partition function
of this quark system.

00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:08.330
So now from our experience
with the duality, now

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:11.459
we can just make a guess.

00:14:11.459 --> 00:14:13.250
We can just make a
guess, because we always

00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:15.583
identify one partition function
with the other partition

00:14:15.583 --> 00:14:16.500
function.

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:18.380
They should be the same object.

00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:23.660
So now we should be able to
identify the expectation value

00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:29.315
of the Wilson loop with the
string [? Cartesian ?] function

00:14:29.315 --> 00:14:34.030
of this particular string,
which ending at the boundary,

00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:40.580
the string partition
function, and the host whose

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:50.360
[? worksheet ?] ending
at the boundary as at C.

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:54.350
So this is just, you can
just make a natural guess.

00:14:59.162 --> 00:15:00.995
You have any questions
regarding this guess?

00:15:09.281 --> 00:15:09.780
Good.

00:15:14.969 --> 00:15:17.010
So now let me may say a
few words about this guy.

00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:35.840
So suppose an [INAUDIBLE] just
parameterize say M sigma alpha

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:47.100
to parameterize the
[? worksheet. ?] Say sigma

00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:51.120
alpha is the
worksheet coordinates,

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:55.460
and [? XM ?] are the
coordinate on the AdS.

00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:58.860
And then this parameterized
a string moving AdS.

00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:07.070
And then the string
partition function,

00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:11.010
you can just write it as DX.

00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:17.950
You integrate of all possible
X. And then the string action

00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:21.790
with the boundary condition that
the worksheet of the boundary

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:27.780
should ending on C.
So this essentially

00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:28.820
is the right-hand side.

00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:33.390
So according to
your convenience,

00:16:33.390 --> 00:16:37.040
you can either choose
the string action

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:46.730
say to be a lambigoto or
[? Poliakoff ?] as you want.

00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:47.230
A Poliakoff.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.700
For example, let me just write
down the remind you what is

00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:58.450
the [? lambigoto. ?] For the
[? lambigoto, ?] you just 2 pi

00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:06.929
alpha prime delta h.

00:17:06.929 --> 00:17:09.790
And the h is the
induced the matrix on

00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:23.934
the [? worksheet. ?]
H is induced matrix on

00:17:23.934 --> 00:17:29.520
the [? worksheet. ?] Yeah.

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:38.240
So in principle we have
a precise mathematical

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:41.664
formulation we can work with.

00:17:41.664 --> 00:17:43.330
Then you can check
whether this proposal

00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:44.680
makes sense, et cetera.

00:17:52.546 --> 00:17:56.496
Of course, again, this object
is very hard to calculate.

00:17:56.496 --> 00:18:01.320
Yeah, I should say you may also
include the fermions, depending

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:04.100
on superstring [INAUDIBLE]
you may have other things.

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:11.940
But this is the
most basic object,

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:13.840
So again, this
object in principle

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:19.420
very difficult to calculate,
but then become simple

00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:23.304
if we can see the g string
goes to the 0 limit,

00:18:23.304 --> 00:18:24.970
and the alpha prime
goes to the 0 limit.

00:18:29.530 --> 00:18:31.380
So in the g string
goes to 0 limit,

00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:39.210
you remember, then we connect
a different topologies.

00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:42.230
You can just stick to
the lowest topology.

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:52.430
So in other words, you can,
when g string goes to 0,

00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:57.690
you can neglect splitting
or joining on the string.

00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:17.110
So you can just can see that
the worksheet with the simplest

00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:17.610
topology.

00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:24.570
And in alpha prime
goes to 0 limit.

00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:27.510
So alpha prime appears
as a prefactor.

00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:30.010
1 over alpha prime
appears as a prefactor

00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:31.717
in this [? worksheet ?] series.

00:19:31.717 --> 00:19:33.550
Whether you do the
[? Poliakoff ?] or you do

00:19:33.550 --> 00:19:35.770
the [? lambogotto, ?]
it's the same thing.

00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:38.610
So alpha prime essentially
plays to the coupling

00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:41.650
constant on the [? worksheet. ?]

00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:44.260
So the alpha prime
goes to 0 limit.

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:47.530
So alpha prime is
essentially the h bar

00:19:47.530 --> 00:19:49.660
on the [? worksheet, ?]
is the [? factive ?] h bar

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:53.520
on the [? worksheets. ?] So
when alpha prime goes to 0,

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:59.540
you can evaluate, then
the path integral.

00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:05.110
Just LIKE in the
gravity formulation,

00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:06.880
we can evaluate
the path integral

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:08.730
when the g Newton goes to 0.

00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:11.287
So here we can evaluate path
integral using the sadale point

00:20:11.287 --> 00:20:11.870
approximation.

00:20:18.832 --> 00:20:19.540
The sadale point.

00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:26.120
So this is [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:29.290
It implies, in the
sadale point especially,

00:20:29.290 --> 00:20:33.330
essentially you just evaluate
the classical action.

00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:35.550
Just find the
classical solution,

00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:38.840
classical string solution.

00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:43.000
And then evaluate the action
on that classical solution.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.361
And so this is
corresponding to [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:48.361 --> 00:20:49.860
fluctuation of the
[? worksheets. ?]

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:02.840
So as I said, this
alpha prime appears

00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:05.610
in a [? worksheet ?]
action just as the place

00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:07.989
which the h bar appears.

00:21:07.989 --> 00:21:09.530
And so when you take
alpha prime goes

00:21:09.530 --> 00:21:11.160
to 0 limit, then
corresponding to your,

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:13.285
you neglect the fluctuation
of the [? worksheet. ?]

00:21:13.285 --> 00:21:16.685
Then you can just can see that
the classical string dynamics.

00:21:20.770 --> 00:21:26.030
Then in this limit, then
we can do this easily.

00:21:26.030 --> 00:21:29.800
So that means in the g
string goes to the 0 limit,

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:31.610
and the alpha prime
goes to 0 limit, which

00:21:31.610 --> 00:21:35.500
again translate on
the field series side

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:37.920
to include infinity.

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:41.330
And the lambda goes
to infinite limit.

00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:47.590
Then we can write the
expectation value of the Wilson

00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:58.569
loop just as the classical
action-- the action

00:21:58.569 --> 00:22:00.610
for the string evaluated
as a classical solution.

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:26.770
So S cl is the action evaluated
at a classical solution.

00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:45.090
So essentially you just have a
[? regions ?] [? worksheet. ?]

00:22:45.090 --> 00:22:46.240
Any questions on this?

00:22:55.865 --> 00:22:57.490
So now we can talk
about some examples.

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:15.197
So the simplest example
is that it's just

00:23:15.197 --> 00:23:16.280
considered a static quark.

00:23:22.550 --> 00:23:24.540
A static quark does not move.

00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:26.756
So if this is a
time direction, then

00:23:26.756 --> 00:23:28.130
the [INAUDIBLE]
line of the quark

00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:32.030
is just a straight line
moving in the time direction.

00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:37.330
And say from minus
infinity, plus infinity.

00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:40.390
And then you can imagine
close to the loop at infinity.

00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:43.410
Anyway, this is just
a straight line.

00:23:43.410 --> 00:23:45.550
So this is a simple situation.

00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:49.640
And so a level is convenient
to give a length to this line,

00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:51.060
the time direction.

00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:58.270
So they record the total
length as T-- capital T.

00:23:58.270 --> 00:24:01.570
And then without
calculating, essentially

00:24:01.570 --> 00:24:06.390
by definition the expectation
value of the Wilson loop

00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:10.720
should be just minus i MT.

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:15.110
So this is just the phase factor
associated with [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:19.140
This [? thing ?] under
the quark does not move.

00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:21.630
And the M is the total
energy of the quark,

00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:23.080
the mass of the quark.

00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:25.230
And then you just have
the standard [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:25.730
[? i ET. ?]

00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:40.442
So now let's try to calculate
on the gravity side.

00:24:40.442 --> 00:24:42.900
Now let's try to calculate what
is the corresponding object

00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:44.140
to this on the gravity side.

00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:57.600
So now let me just remind
you the AdS [? metric. ?]

00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:00.340
So we can use the
two difference way,

00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:11.760
say whether using
this R coordinate,

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:13.030
or using this Z coordinate.

00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:25.730
And they're related by
a very simple coordinate

00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:26.355
transformation.

00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:31.649
Just 1 over.

00:25:31.649 --> 00:25:32.440
Remind you of that.

00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:43.440
So on the gravity side, so
let's now draw our boundary.

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:46.555
So this is r equal to
infinity, or z equal to 0.

00:25:49.410 --> 00:25:53.425
So the r increase in this
direction, and the z increase

00:25:53.425 --> 00:25:54.175
in that direction.

00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:01.030
So such objects on
the gravity side,

00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:04.222
just from the description
we said earlier,

00:26:04.222 --> 00:26:05.680
was just corresponding
to a string.

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:08.765
Does not move at all.

00:26:08.765 --> 00:26:11.015
Extends from the boundary
all the way to the interior.

00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:16.880
And because this is just a
single quark and does not move.

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:18.440
This is just our
previous picture.

00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:27.690
So we can parameterize it.

00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:33.520
So as we discussed
before, this action

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:40.850
is reparameterization
environment.

00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:44.070
So that means we can choose
the sigma and the tau

00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:45.910
at this 2 sigma coordinate.

00:26:45.910 --> 00:26:48.970
So sigma alpha.

00:26:48.970 --> 00:26:51.901
And we'll call the
tau on the sigma.

00:26:51.901 --> 00:26:53.400
So I can choose the
tau on the sigma

00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:55.855
as we want according
to the convenience.

00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:04.880
So for this one, let
me choose tau equal

00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:08.820
just t at the real space time t.

00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:11.030
So that's t.

00:27:11.030 --> 00:27:16.560
And then take the sigma along
the radial direction, this r.

00:27:23.010 --> 00:27:26.170
So this straight string
just corresponding

00:27:26.170 --> 00:27:33.700
to the solution, which x
i t r equal to constant.

00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:36.600
So this is a string
which does not move.

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:41.730
So the other directions,
it just a constant.

00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:43.980
If you put it at some
point, it stays there.

00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:50.210
So this is the obvious
solution of that configuration.

00:27:55.782 --> 00:27:56.490
So you can check.

00:27:56.490 --> 00:27:59.056
This is indeed a solution to
the [? lambogoto ?] action.

00:27:59.056 --> 00:28:00.680
I will not check
there, because this is

00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:02.910
the essentially started with.

00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:05.100
So you can immediately tell
this must be a solution.

00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:12.490
So low let's try to find the
classical action corresponding

00:28:12.490 --> 00:28:13.775
to this solution.

00:28:16.770 --> 00:28:19.620
So for this purpose, we
have to work the [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:25.590
[? metric. ?] So the easiest
way to work out this the reduced

00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:28.020
[? metric ?] as follows.

00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:33.510
So the [? worksheet ?]
[? metric ?] would be h alpha

00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:35.220
beta.

00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:38.870
So it is sigma
alpha to sigma beta.

00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:40.700
And h alpha beta is
given by this guy.

00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:50.140
And the easiest way to work
out is that you just write down

00:28:50.140 --> 00:29:06.230
the AdS [? metric. ?] And now
you think that [? ht ?] and X

00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:09.480
and r as a function
of the sigma tau.

00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:13.490
And you just substitute
the functions in.

00:29:13.490 --> 00:29:14.912
So t just equal to tau.

00:29:14.912 --> 00:29:16.370
So this just becomes
t tau squared.

00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:23.530
But X is independent of t and r.

00:29:23.530 --> 00:29:27.850
So when I write the space
time coordinates, I use x.

00:29:27.850 --> 00:29:29.540
But when I write
it as a coordinate

00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:31.620
as a function of
the [? worksheet ?],

00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:33.240
then I use the capital.

00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:37.310
So this is just to emphasize,
this is a function.

00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:40.640
Anyway, and here I replace by
that X which is independent

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:41.170
of [? ht ?].

00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:43.670
So there's nothing here.

00:29:43.670 --> 00:29:46.760
And now the R square
become sigma squared.

00:29:50.050 --> 00:29:55.129
So it become sigma squared,
because i just equal to sigma.

00:29:55.129 --> 00:29:57.170
And then this is my
[? worksheet ?] [? metric. ?]

00:29:57.170 --> 00:30:06.660
Sigma square, r square minus d
tau square plus r square sigma

00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:11.090
square [? d sigma ?] squared.

00:30:11.090 --> 00:30:14.110
So this is my induced
[? worksheet ?] [? metric ?]

00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:16.675
for this special worksheet.

00:30:16.675 --> 00:30:18.550
And if you imagine,
there's a time direction,

00:30:18.550 --> 00:30:20.165
which is this string
just translate

00:30:20.165 --> 00:30:21.227
in the time direction.

00:30:21.227 --> 00:30:21.810
Does not move.

00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:28.830
So now we can easily work
out what is the determinant.

00:30:28.830 --> 00:30:31.850
This is diagonal [? metric. ?]
You see these two cancel.

00:30:31.850 --> 00:30:33.420
So the determinant
just equal to one.

00:30:40.734 --> 00:30:42.900
So now we can write down
the [? worksheet ?] action.

00:30:47.650 --> 00:30:48.445
Let me erase here.

00:30:55.980 --> 00:31:07.960
So the [? worksheet ?] action S
N [? g ?] will be just minus 1

00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:09.402
over 2 pi alpha prime.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:15.060
Now the theta h is
just equal to 1.

00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:17.590
Then I just have
integration of dt.

00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:21.340
Then I have integration of
dr, because tau equal to t

00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:22.315
and sigma equal to r.

00:31:28.030 --> 00:31:29.620
And r should be
from 0 to infinity.

00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:39.725
So this integration of dt just
give us a capital T factor.

00:31:48.485 --> 00:31:49.610
And then this is divergent.

00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:56.765
So normally when we see
something divergent,

00:31:56.765 --> 00:32:03.220
as we always do, we just
say this is not at infinity.

00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:06.375
Let's put a small cutoff
here at i equal to lambda.

00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:17.175
So if I do that, and then
this here become lambda.

00:32:23.210 --> 00:32:27.080
So now if you read
from here, this

00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:30.500
should be identified with wc.

00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:33.900
I times of that object
should be identified with wc.

00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:37.630
And that should be
equal to minus iMT.

00:32:37.630 --> 00:32:46.290
So we conclude that
the mass must be

00:32:46.290 --> 00:32:48.615
lambda over 2 pi alpha prime.

00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:58.680
But this is actually what I
just advertised earlier, said

00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:02.120
you can check it explicitly,
that the mass of the object

00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:06.610
is precisely just the radial
location divided by r, divided

00:33:06.610 --> 00:33:07.720
by 2 pi alpha prime.

00:33:10.590 --> 00:33:14.569
And I just confirmed
that expectation.

00:33:14.569 --> 00:33:15.985
I just confirmed
that expectation.

00:33:21.090 --> 00:33:27.270
So this is infinite
by design, because I

00:33:27.270 --> 00:33:29.620
want to have an infinite
mass quark so that I

00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:30.760
don't have a fluctuation.

00:33:34.270 --> 00:33:36.300
And so in principle
I can take lambda.

00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:38.130
It's not just I want.

00:33:38.130 --> 00:33:40.010
But actually I can
show the lambda.

00:33:40.010 --> 00:33:42.010
So it actually make sense.

00:33:42.010 --> 00:33:44.926
So physically you
should think there's

00:33:44.926 --> 00:33:46.300
some kind of
[? disequilibrium ?]

00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:48.566
here which I can
show the location.

00:33:48.566 --> 00:33:50.440
And in the end, I take
lambda go to infinity,

00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:52.250
because I want the
mass go to infinity.

00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:03.050
So it's also instructive to
rewrite this in terms of the z.

00:34:10.050 --> 00:34:16.400
So in terms of the d, and
the z is related to capital R

00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:18.520
by this way, So in
this corresponding

00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:20.650
to a small thing in z.

00:34:20.650 --> 00:34:23.310
So z will be R squared.

00:34:23.310 --> 00:34:27.330
So this corresponding to
a cut off z at epsilon.

00:34:30.630 --> 00:34:31.239
At epsilon.

00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:39.431
So we can write this
M in terms of z.

00:34:39.431 --> 00:34:43.545
Then equal to become
2 pi alpha prime R

00:34:43.545 --> 00:34:44.670
squared divided by epsilon.

00:34:55.489 --> 00:34:57.930
So now let me do one more step.

00:34:57.930 --> 00:35:03.590
So as we said before, that
in terms of z-coordinate,

00:35:03.590 --> 00:35:05.090
so you'll also have
checked yourself

00:35:05.090 --> 00:35:08.480
by doing this holographic
bound exciter.

00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:10.710
So this epsilon can be
conceived as a short distance

00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:29.220
cutoff because of the
boundary, [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:32.280
cut off at boundary.

00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:35.800
So this can also be conceived
as the mass of the quark.

00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:40.340
And due to that, you put
some short distance cutoff.

00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:44.270
Say epsilon distance
away from the quark.

00:35:44.270 --> 00:35:51.800
And so now let's remember the
dictionary R square divided

00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:55.410
by alpha prime is related to
on the gravity side to what?

00:35:55.410 --> 00:35:57.590
Do you remember?

00:35:57.590 --> 00:35:58.465
Yeah.

00:35:58.465 --> 00:35:59.090
A limit, right?

00:35:59.090 --> 00:36:00.305
The big box here.

00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:08.340
So R to the power of 4
divided by alpha prime

00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:10.210
squared equal to what?

00:36:10.210 --> 00:36:13.180
Equal to lambda, which
is the g [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:21.960
square N [INAUDIBLE]
g square N. And then

00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:25.250
the five-dimensional
Newton constant divided

00:36:25.250 --> 00:36:29.286
by R cubed, that is related
to the N. So this is-- I

00:36:29.286 --> 00:36:32.760
think it's pi divided
by 2 N squared.

00:36:38.650 --> 00:36:41.530
You don't need to remember
the precise prefactors.

00:36:41.530 --> 00:36:45.890
But you should remember that R
squared divided by alpha prime

00:36:45.890 --> 00:36:46.765
is related to lambda.

00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:54.070
So lambda is the root coupling.

00:36:54.070 --> 00:36:58.140
So now we can rewrite this as
the square root lambda divided

00:36:58.140 --> 00:37:01.139
by 2 pi, then 1 over epsilon.

00:37:09.522 --> 00:37:11.105
So there's something
interesting here.

00:37:14.370 --> 00:37:18.090
He said there's a
square root lambda.

00:37:18.090 --> 00:37:20.200
It's the square root
lambda appearing here.

00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:23.820
And this is a square
root, g squared times N.

00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:27.040
So if you remember
in the [? QED ?],

00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:29.380
so if you try to calculate
what the [? self ?] energy

00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:33.130
of the electron in
the most naive way.

00:37:33.130 --> 00:37:36.170
So electron naively have an
infinite potential energy,

00:37:36.170 --> 00:37:38.760
because if you go
closer to the electron,

00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:41.880
and then the energy
will blow up.

00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:44.357
But if you put a small
cutoff around the electron,

00:37:44.357 --> 00:37:45.440
then what would be energy.

00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:47.587
You would you get?

00:37:47.587 --> 00:37:48.462
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:52.370
HONG LIU: Yep.

00:37:52.370 --> 00:37:54.950
Say if you put two electrons.

00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:57.530
Two electrons.

00:37:57.530 --> 00:37:58.810
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:58.810 --> 00:37:59.435
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:37:59.435 --> 00:38:00.560
You use a lot of electrons.

00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:03.390
You probe it.

00:38:03.390 --> 00:38:06.110
Then you would get e square.

00:38:06.110 --> 00:38:07.890
You would get e square.

00:38:07.890 --> 00:38:09.630
But here, interesting
thing is that it's

00:38:09.630 --> 00:38:12.620
proportional to the square
root of the e square.

00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:16.560
This is proportional to the
square root of e square.

00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:19.261
So this square root lambda is
essentially the strong coupling

00:38:19.261 --> 00:38:19.760
prediction.

00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:28.620
We will say more about this.

00:38:42.030 --> 00:38:43.530
So we have finished.

00:38:43.530 --> 00:38:47.130
This simple example
seems to make sense.

00:38:47.130 --> 00:38:50.550
So this just corresponding
to a mass of the quark.

00:38:50.550 --> 00:38:53.640
So now let's do something
a little bit more

00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:55.400
[? nontrivial ?].

00:38:55.400 --> 00:39:12.230
So let's consider the static
potential between a quark

00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:13.210
and the anti-quark.

00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:28.169
So from the field
series side, we

00:39:28.169 --> 00:39:29.585
can see that such
a configuration.

00:39:34.530 --> 00:39:38.920
So suppose this is
some x 1 direction.

00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:40.810
So this is a time direction.

00:39:40.810 --> 00:39:43.180
So we can see
there's such a loop.

00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:47.800
So this is L in
the x 1 direction.

00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:49.880
Say this is L divided by 2.

00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:52.240
And this is minus
L divided by 2.

00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:54.840
And in the T direction,
again the length

00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:59.960
is capital T. The
length is capital T.

00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:02.620
And we always take the T
to be much, much greater

00:40:02.620 --> 00:40:07.410
than L. Essentially you can
imagine this T as infinite.

00:40:10.330 --> 00:40:16.660
So as we mentioned last time, if
you can see the loop like this,

00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:18.710
when the T become much,
much greater than L,

00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:21.010
you can forget about the
beginning part and the end

00:40:21.010 --> 00:40:21.509
part.

00:40:21.509 --> 00:40:23.580
Essentially, you have
two parallel line.

00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:26.211
And the parallel lines in the
opposite direction in time,

00:40:26.211 --> 00:40:28.210
then you can see that
this is this corresponding

00:40:28.210 --> 00:40:31.320
to a quark, this corresponding
to the anti-quark moving

00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:34.020
parallel in time.

00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:38.820
And then again, the
expectation of the Wilson loop

00:40:38.820 --> 00:40:41.740
should give you-- so
this is a static system.

00:40:45.950 --> 00:40:49.380
This is a system with
translation variance in time.

00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:53.290
If I take T go to infinite, you
can imagine as a translation

00:40:53.290 --> 00:40:55.780
variance in time.

00:40:55.780 --> 00:40:58.710
And then due to this
translation variance in time,

00:40:58.710 --> 00:41:03.040
you can write it to [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:07.490
It must have the falling
form, just on general ground.

00:41:07.490 --> 00:41:11.850
And e totally is just the
total energy of the system.

00:41:11.850 --> 00:41:13.180
Just in quantum mechanics.

00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:16.180
In quantum mechanics, any
translation variance system,

00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:20.080
the whole thing just minus iE T.

00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:23.300
And the total
should corresponding

00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:28.950
to the mass over the
two external quark,

00:41:28.950 --> 00:41:34.377
then plus the potential energy
between them [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:34.377 --> 00:41:35.210
energy between them.

00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:43.510
So if you calculate this
Wilson loop in say [? QCD. ?]

00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:46.448
So that will give you the
force between the quark

00:41:46.448 --> 00:41:47.697
and the anti-quark, et cetera.

00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:55.110
But in general, if you have
a strongly coupled [? gate ?]

00:41:55.110 --> 00:42:00.160
series, we don't know how
to do such a calculation.

00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:02.340
It's very hard to do.

00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:11.650
But in this case, equipped with
this, equipped by this, then

00:42:11.650 --> 00:42:15.090
the gravity will help us
to do this calculation.

00:42:15.090 --> 00:42:29.875
So the gravity can help us
find V(L) and strong coupling.

00:42:42.090 --> 00:42:45.290
So now we want to calculate
the string [? worksheets ?]

00:42:45.290 --> 00:42:46.790
corresponding to
such configuration.

00:42:56.150 --> 00:42:58.182
Do you have any questions
regarding our set-up?

00:43:11.490 --> 00:43:12.810
Good.

00:43:12.810 --> 00:43:21.210
So now let's write.

00:43:21.210 --> 00:43:23.240
You can see that the
gravity side again, this

00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:24.335
is the boundary of AdS.

00:43:27.220 --> 00:43:32.450
And now let's imagine
this is our x 1 direction.

00:43:32.450 --> 00:43:36.990
Then we have a quark
here at L divided by 2.

00:43:36.990 --> 00:43:41.860
And then have anti-quark
here at minus L divided by 2.

00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:44.235
So you can see that these two
lines, it's one from quark,

00:43:44.235 --> 00:43:46.190
one from anti-quark.

00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:48.820
And now this is
translates in time.

00:43:53.820 --> 00:43:59.260
So this the r equal to
infinite, or z equal to 0.

00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:03.030
So if we just have two
isolated quark, if each of them

00:44:03.030 --> 00:44:05.300
are isolated, then the
string [? worksheet ?],

00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:07.860
we are just as we said before,
just two straight line.

00:44:10.570 --> 00:44:12.100
Just two straight line.

00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:15.510
And that's corresponding
to an isolated quark.

00:44:15.510 --> 00:44:20.765
But now these two
quark can interact.

00:44:20.765 --> 00:44:22.760
Can interact.

00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:25.980
So the magic expectation is
that this string [? worksheet ?]

00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:29.600
will get deformed, and the
[INAUDIBLE] expectations

00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:31.900
that they will just
connect to each other.

00:44:41.724 --> 00:44:43.390
So you expect the
string [? worksheet ?]

00:44:43.390 --> 00:44:45.334
will be like this.

00:44:45.334 --> 00:44:47.250
So if the string
[? worksheet ?] is like this,

00:44:47.250 --> 00:44:48.770
that means there's no
interaction between these two

00:44:48.770 --> 00:44:49.269
quarks.

00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:59.817
And now if the two string,
yeah, so this is the quark.

00:44:59.817 --> 00:45:01.150
And then this is the anti-quark.

00:45:01.150 --> 00:45:04.520
So they should have
opposite orientation.

00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:06.570
And then the string
[? worksheet ?],

00:45:06.570 --> 00:45:09.190
we have orientation like this.

00:45:09.190 --> 00:45:11.890
So it will go off like this.

00:45:11.890 --> 00:45:18.011
So now you expect that
the [? worksheet ?]

00:45:18.011 --> 00:45:18.760
will be like this.

00:45:21.489 --> 00:45:23.280
And again, it's transition
variant in time.

00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:28.135
Any questions on this?

00:45:28.135 --> 00:45:29.010
Is this clear to you?

00:45:32.740 --> 00:45:34.500
So geometrically,
this is only way

00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:38.480
which these two quark can have
interactions is by joining

00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:40.442
their [? worksheet ?] together.

00:45:40.442 --> 00:45:42.900
AUDIENCE: So generally, we
would be doing the path integral

00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:47.070
over all the closed strings that
have those boundary emissions.

00:45:47.070 --> 00:45:47.570
Sorry.

00:45:47.570 --> 00:45:48.234
Open string.

00:45:48.234 --> 00:45:48.859
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:45:48.859 --> 00:45:49.058
That's right.

00:45:49.058 --> 00:45:49.554
That's right.

00:45:49.554 --> 00:45:50.054
Yeah.

00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:54.680
Good.

00:45:54.680 --> 00:46:00.010
So now with this
realization, then the rest

00:46:00.010 --> 00:46:01.691
become mechanical.

00:46:01.691 --> 00:46:02.565
Not quite mechanical.

00:46:07.830 --> 00:46:08.330
Yeah.

00:46:08.330 --> 00:46:15.390
So we can choose, as
before, tau equal to T.

00:46:15.390 --> 00:46:17.650
So T equals infinity.

00:46:17.650 --> 00:46:20.410
So we can consider the system
translation variant in time.

00:46:30.050 --> 00:46:35.040
So let's choose again tau
equal to T. So we can also

00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:38.150
chose the sigma
still equal to R.

00:46:38.150 --> 00:46:40.540
But now let me do it
slightly differently.

00:46:40.540 --> 00:46:43.230
So let me do it
sigma equal to x 1.

00:46:43.230 --> 00:46:44.090
So you can do both.

00:46:44.090 --> 00:46:47.592
But just to give you
a variety, [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:47.592 --> 00:46:49.800
sigma equals to x 1, because
x 1 [? direction also ?]

00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:52.510
become nontrivial.

00:46:52.510 --> 00:46:55.224
And let me choose
sigma equal to x 1.

00:46:55.224 --> 00:46:56.640
And then this
[? worksheet ?] then

00:46:56.640 --> 00:47:01.440
is parameterized
just by z, which

00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:02.695
is only a function of sigma.

00:47:05.330 --> 00:47:09.650
So sigma runs from
minus half L to L.

00:47:09.650 --> 00:47:12.150
And then this string would be
parameterized by some function

00:47:12.150 --> 00:47:13.704
z as a function of sigma.

00:47:13.704 --> 00:47:15.370
And because of the
translation variance,

00:47:15.370 --> 00:47:18.540
you cannot have dependence on t.

00:47:18.540 --> 00:47:20.840
Cannot have dependence on t.

00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:27.220
And also, all the other
directions are not equal to 1.

00:47:27.220 --> 00:47:33.100
They should be just
constant, because they're not

00:47:33.100 --> 00:47:34.980
moving in the other directions.

00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:36.560
So they should be
just constants.

00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:41.760
So the only non-trivial thing
would be in the x 1 direction.

00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:44.590
You can also choose
the sigma to be z,

00:47:44.590 --> 00:47:47.830
and the x 1 would
be a function of z,

00:47:47.830 --> 00:47:49.619
then the x 1 would be
a function of sigma.

00:47:49.619 --> 00:47:50.660
You can do it either way.

00:47:50.660 --> 00:47:52.890
Doesn't matter.

00:47:52.890 --> 00:47:59.180
So the boundary condition
would be z re-evaluated

00:47:59.180 --> 00:48:02.797
at plus minus 1/2 L.
Then this of course

00:48:02.797 --> 00:48:03.880
should be at the boundary.

00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:06.805
So it should be equal to 0.

00:48:06.805 --> 00:48:08.180
So this is the
boundary condition

00:48:08.180 --> 00:48:09.775
that this starting
from the boundary.

00:48:16.910 --> 00:48:20.789
So now let's try to write down
the [? worksheet ?] action.

00:48:20.789 --> 00:48:22.580
Let's try to write down
the [? worksheet ?]

00:48:22.580 --> 00:48:25.870
metric under the
[? worksheet ?] action.

00:48:25.870 --> 00:48:28.217
So the [? worksheet ?]
metric is again as

00:48:28.217 --> 00:48:29.300
what we were doing before.

00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:33.590
You can just write down
i equal to z square minus

00:48:33.590 --> 00:48:39.115
dt square plus dx
square plus tz square.

00:48:41.810 --> 00:48:44.900
So now t equal to tau.

00:48:44.900 --> 00:48:46.990
So dt squared just
become d tau square.

00:48:52.090 --> 00:48:54.632
And the [? dx 1 ?] square just
become [? d ?] sigma square.

00:48:54.632 --> 00:48:55.340
under the others.

00:48:55.340 --> 00:48:56.210
We don't need to care.

00:48:56.210 --> 00:48:57.668
So this just become
d sigma square.

00:49:00.840 --> 00:49:03.220
And the z is a
function of sigma.

00:49:03.220 --> 00:49:10.970
So this just become z prime
sigma square d sigma square.

00:49:14.070 --> 00:49:17.240
And then you just find
this is equal to R square

00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:24.855
z square d tau square plus
1 plus z prime squared

00:49:24.855 --> 00:49:26.980
d sigma square.

00:49:26.980 --> 00:49:31.992
So this is the induced metric
on the [? worksheet ?].

00:49:31.992 --> 00:49:34.450
And then you can now write down
the [? lambagoto ?] action.

00:49:37.330 --> 00:49:43.625
So it just 1 over 2 pi
alpha prime d 2 sigma.

00:49:43.625 --> 00:49:45.000
And then you take
the determinant

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.460
of this metric,
which is easy to do.

00:49:47.460 --> 00:49:50.620
You get R square factor out.

00:49:50.620 --> 00:49:53.855
And then you get
1 over d square.

00:49:57.330 --> 00:50:00.465
And it just square root
of 1 plus z prime squared.

00:50:00.465 --> 00:50:02.090
So this is the square
root determinant.

00:50:09.260 --> 00:50:13.380
So we can do a little bit of
[? massage. ?] So this d 2

00:50:13.380 --> 00:50:18.460
sigma is dt d sigma.

00:50:18.460 --> 00:50:23.210
And the sigma is from minus L to
1/2 L, because this is a sigma,

00:50:23.210 --> 00:50:27.760
is x 1 from minus L to 1/2 L.

00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:30.170
So [INAUDIBLE] depend on t.

00:50:30.170 --> 00:50:38.470
So we can just replace it
by a factor of capital T.

00:50:38.470 --> 00:50:41.910
And obviously this system
have symmetry between the x

00:50:41.910 --> 00:50:45.015
and the minus x.

00:50:45.015 --> 00:50:48.980
And then I can just choose the
integration from half of it.

00:50:48.980 --> 00:50:53.560
So I do it from 0
to L divided by 2.

00:50:53.560 --> 00:50:56.360
And then I eliminated 2
on the [? downstairs. ?]

00:51:04.980 --> 00:51:08.310
So this is my action.

00:51:08.310 --> 00:51:10.560
Then what I need to do is
I need to [? extremize ?].

00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:18.380
This is action
respect to z sigma.

00:51:23.070 --> 00:51:24.590
Then you solve
for z sigma, which

00:51:24.590 --> 00:51:27.390
satisfy the boundary condition.

00:51:27.390 --> 00:51:34.630
And then solve for z sigma.

00:51:34.630 --> 00:51:38.650
And then find S
classical action.

00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:56.050
So now this reduce to
a freshmen problem--

00:51:56.050 --> 00:52:00.050
literally, little
cute freshman problem.

00:52:07.950 --> 00:52:13.640
So which is actually quite fun
to do with a little bit twist.

00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:15.060
With a little bit twist.

00:52:17.830 --> 00:52:19.330
So do you want to
do it immediately,

00:52:19.330 --> 00:52:22.190
or do want to have a break?

00:52:22.190 --> 00:52:26.860
So now let's try to do this.

00:52:26.860 --> 00:52:28.520
Try to do this.

00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:37.090
So first, just by
consistency we expect

00:52:37.090 --> 00:52:43.890
this thing must be divergent,
because this contains 2M.

00:52:43.890 --> 00:52:47.580
But 2M in our set-up,
if you start something

00:52:47.580 --> 00:52:50.480
from the boundary,
and the M is infinite,

00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:54.370
then we would expect this
thing to be divergent.

00:52:54.370 --> 00:52:57.380
We would expect something
to be divergent.

00:52:57.380 --> 00:53:01.120
And indeed, you see
the dangerous thing

00:53:01.120 --> 00:53:07.470
is that when the sigma
approach [INAUDIBLE] over 2,

00:53:07.470 --> 00:53:09.980
then you have a 1
over d square here,

00:53:09.980 --> 00:53:14.470
and at this z of 1
over 2, this is 0.

00:53:14.470 --> 00:53:16.970
So there is some potential
divergences here.

00:53:16.970 --> 00:53:18.940
But of course you
also have to look

00:53:18.940 --> 00:53:20.840
at the behavior of this term.

00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:24.790
By this you see there is some
potential divergence here.

00:53:24.790 --> 00:53:26.460
And this is expected,
because we know

00:53:26.460 --> 00:53:29.860
that this must contain the 2M.

00:53:29.860 --> 00:53:31.640
And if this whole
story is consistent,

00:53:31.640 --> 00:53:35.350
there must be a divergent.

00:53:35.350 --> 00:53:41.240
So let us just write
with that in mind.

00:53:43.790 --> 00:53:47.660
So let me just subtract
the 2 MT from here.

00:53:47.660 --> 00:53:49.390
So this [? UNG ?].

00:53:49.390 --> 00:53:54.880
So this is supposed
to be minus i E

00:53:54.880 --> 00:54:05.940
total T. So from
this expectation,

00:54:05.940 --> 00:54:09.455
we would write V(L).

00:54:09.455 --> 00:54:14.680
So now again I replace the R
square divided by alpha prime

00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:16.950
by square root lambda.

00:54:16.950 --> 00:54:18.695
So we have square
root lambda pi.

00:54:21.440 --> 00:54:29.680
Then L divided by 2 d
sigma 1 over z square 1

00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:33.820
plus z prime square.

00:54:33.820 --> 00:54:40.450
And the minus now
1 over epsilon.

00:54:40.450 --> 00:54:42.580
Because the [? twice ?]
the M is just

00:54:42.580 --> 00:54:45.370
the square root of pi divided by
the square root lambda divided

00:54:45.370 --> 00:54:47.100
by pi times 1 over epsilon.

00:54:47.100 --> 00:54:48.970
So I take out this factor.

00:54:48.970 --> 00:54:50.718
And so we expect the
V(L) [INAUDIBLE].

00:54:54.070 --> 00:55:00.990
So if this guess we have
said earlier is correct,

00:55:00.990 --> 00:55:05.164
that the partition
function. of the Wilson loop

00:55:05.164 --> 00:55:06.580
should be related
to the partition

00:55:06.580 --> 00:55:08.620
function of the string,
and then reduced

00:55:08.620 --> 00:55:13.810
to a classical action, et
cetera-- if that idea is right,

00:55:13.810 --> 00:55:16.880
we should find by
self consistency

00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:19.310
that this thing
should be finite.

00:55:19.310 --> 00:55:22.330
This thing should be
finite, and should also

00:55:22.330 --> 00:55:25.560
be [? inactive, ?] because
the quark and the anti-quark

00:55:25.560 --> 00:55:31.700
have an attractive force.

00:55:31.700 --> 00:55:36.270
So we should find this thing
to be finite and negative.

00:55:36.270 --> 00:55:39.360
You see, this guy is
actually positive.

00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:43.020
And no matter what is z, this
guy is actually positive.

00:55:43.020 --> 00:55:46.290
So that means that this guy must
be smaller than 1 over epsilon.

00:55:46.290 --> 00:55:49.170
And so you get something active.

00:55:49.170 --> 00:55:53.040
So this guy must be some 1
over epsilon lambda something.

00:55:56.250 --> 00:55:58.680
So now let me call this
to be my Lagrangian.

00:55:58.680 --> 00:56:01.575
So now we had to do a small
variation of the problem.

00:56:04.870 --> 00:56:05.600
Yeah.

00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:09.380
Maybe not confused by that
L. Let me put this script

00:56:09.380 --> 00:56:14.190
L. So this is my Lagrangian.

00:56:14.190 --> 00:56:19.130
And then this is a
one-dimensional Lagrangian

00:56:19.130 --> 00:56:20.966
problem.

00:56:20.966 --> 00:56:22.840
And this Lagrangian does
not depend on sigma.

00:56:25.740 --> 00:56:28.272
So we treat the sigma as time.

00:56:28.272 --> 00:56:29.980
So this is like a
one-dimensional problem

00:56:29.980 --> 00:56:31.660
with the sigma as time.

00:56:31.660 --> 00:56:35.180
So if the Lagrangian
does not depend on time,

00:56:35.180 --> 00:56:36.300
what's going to happen?

00:56:36.300 --> 00:56:37.550
AUDIENCE: Energy conservation.

00:56:37.550 --> 00:56:38.216
HONG LIU: Exact.

00:56:38.216 --> 00:56:39.750
The energy's conserved.

00:56:39.750 --> 00:56:40.830
The energy's conserved.

00:56:40.830 --> 00:56:43.890
So we can write down the energy
corresponding to this guy.

00:56:43.890 --> 00:56:51.690
And the energy is z
prime pi z minus L.

00:56:51.690 --> 00:56:54.110
So this must be constant.

00:56:54.110 --> 00:56:59.260
And the pi z, just the economic
momentum conjugates to the z.

00:57:05.180 --> 00:57:06.520
So all this is very elementary.

00:57:06.520 --> 00:57:10.915
You can immediately
write down this equation,

00:57:10.915 --> 00:57:12.040
[? h of 1 over ?] d square.

00:57:18.040 --> 00:57:20.260
So you find the
pi you plug here.

00:57:20.260 --> 00:57:21.600
Then you find this equation.

00:57:21.600 --> 00:57:23.389
This equation just become that.

00:57:31.220 --> 00:57:35.591
So now let's try to
parameterize this constant.

00:57:35.591 --> 00:57:37.840
So the way to do it is just
look for the special point

00:57:37.840 --> 00:57:39.820
on the trajectory.

00:57:39.820 --> 00:57:42.605
So the special point on the
trajectory is this point.

00:57:42.605 --> 00:57:44.230
By symmetry, it should
be corresponding

00:57:44.230 --> 00:57:45.390
to sigma equal to 0.

00:57:47.677 --> 00:57:49.260
So this point, it
should corresponding

00:57:49.260 --> 00:57:51.030
to sigma equal to zero.

00:57:51.030 --> 00:57:55.030
And so let me call
this point a z 0.

00:57:55.030 --> 00:58:00.408
So this is essentially how
deep this string are going

00:58:00.408 --> 00:58:04.980
into the [? back. ?] So
let's call that 2 [? bz ?] 0.

00:58:04.980 --> 00:58:09.580
So it's clear at sigma
equal to zero, the z

00:58:09.580 --> 00:58:13.390
prime should be equal to zero.

00:58:13.390 --> 00:58:15.880
So this should be just
equal to 1 over z 0 squared.

00:58:19.580 --> 00:58:22.370
Should be 1 over z 0 squared.

00:58:22.370 --> 00:58:25.030
And then you can just
immediately rewrite

00:58:25.030 --> 00:58:28.020
this as ordinary
differential equation.

00:58:43.020 --> 00:58:45.470
So now you can immediately
integrate this equation.

00:58:48.680 --> 00:59:01.230
And say z 0 is found, it's
determined at the boundary

00:59:01.230 --> 00:59:05.610
condition by requiring
z L equal to 0.

00:59:08.860 --> 00:59:15.130
So I will not do it here, but
you can do it in 30 seconds

00:59:15.130 --> 00:59:16.345
to find the z 0.

00:59:16.345 --> 00:59:18.220
You actually don't need
to actually integrate

00:59:18.220 --> 00:59:18.830
this equation.

00:59:18.830 --> 00:59:20.730
There's a simple trick to do it.

00:59:20.730 --> 00:59:24.410
Anyway so let me just
write down the answer.

00:59:24.410 --> 00:59:29.700
You can find the z 0 equal
to L. It's proportional to L,

00:59:29.700 --> 00:59:35.430
under the square root of
pi divided by 2 comma 1/4,

00:59:35.430 --> 00:59:37.471
and become 3/4.

00:59:37.471 --> 00:59:40.200
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:59:40.200 --> 00:59:43.670
HONG LIU: Oh, this funny number.

00:59:43.670 --> 00:59:44.999
AUDIENCE: 30 seconds.

00:59:44.999 --> 00:59:45.624
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:59:49.745 --> 00:59:50.245
Yeah.

00:59:50.245 --> 00:59:51.328
Mathematica will tell you.

00:59:55.410 --> 00:59:56.530
Take you 25 seconds.

00:59:56.530 --> 01:00:00.610
You type into the Mathematica,
and the four seconds

01:00:00.610 --> 01:00:03.290
to check the error,
and the Mathematica one

01:00:03.290 --> 01:00:04.540
second to give you the answer.

01:00:09.940 --> 01:00:11.180
So you find this.

01:00:16.530 --> 01:00:19.560
So we will comment on this
implication a little bit later.

01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:25.350
So now we can plug
this into this action.

01:00:25.350 --> 01:00:28.670
So let me see.

01:00:28.670 --> 01:00:30.460
Yeah.

01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:36.030
So now let me plug this equation
back into this equation.

01:00:43.712 --> 01:00:44.670
[INAUDIBLE] [? star ?].

01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:51.100
So there's again a
simple trick to do it.

01:00:51.100 --> 01:00:54.690
You don't need to know
the expressive form of z,

01:00:54.690 --> 01:00:59.320
because what you can do is
you can rewrite this V(L).

01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:03.490
You can rewrite this
integral as follows-- V(L),

01:01:03.490 --> 01:01:07.520
say this square root of
lambda divided by pi.

01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:11.910
So this d sigma, you can write
it as dz divided by z prime.

01:01:11.910 --> 01:01:13.180
So this is the d sigma.

01:01:13.180 --> 01:01:16.270
You can change the
variable from sigma to z.

01:01:16.270 --> 01:01:21.960
And then this just
integration become z 0 to z 0.

01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:30.030
And then you have the 1 over z
square, 1 plus z prime square.

01:01:30.030 --> 01:01:33.330
So now you can substitute
what is the z prime into here.

01:01:33.330 --> 01:01:35.920
And now this just
become integral over z,

01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:37.030
and just pure integral.

01:01:39.772 --> 01:01:41.230
We still need to
minus [INAUDIBLE].

01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:48.550
So if you plug into the
expression for the z prime,

01:01:48.550 --> 01:01:53.250
and then do a
scaling-- say take z

01:01:53.250 --> 01:01:56.620
equal to z 0 y--
because there you

01:01:56.620 --> 01:02:00.790
see this all have the
nice scaling form.

01:02:00.790 --> 01:02:03.800
So it's good to
scale the z 0 out.

01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:06.680
So let's do a scaling,
z equal to z 0 y.

01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:08.860
Then you could
rewrite that integral.

01:02:08.860 --> 01:02:10.375
Sorry this is no V(Z).

01:02:10.375 --> 01:02:11.840
This is V(L).

01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:15.995
So you can rewrite that integral
as V(L) equal to square root

01:02:15.995 --> 01:02:20.000
of pi, square root of lambda
divided by pi 1 over z 0.

01:02:27.380 --> 01:02:31.840
So now I have to put
the epsilon in here

01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:35.900
anticipating that this integral
will be divergent here.

01:02:35.900 --> 01:02:38.310
So this is the same
epsilon we put in there

01:02:38.310 --> 01:02:41.210
when we do the single quark.

01:02:43.980 --> 01:02:45.390
So we put it there.

01:02:49.110 --> 01:02:49.610
Yeah.

01:02:49.610 --> 01:02:52.000
Maybe let me just
write one more step

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.530
so that you can see
it more explicitly.

01:02:55.530 --> 01:03:02.090
Yeah, so I just plug this
in, plug this into here.

01:03:02.090 --> 01:03:09.330
Then what you get square root
lambda z zero square epsilon.

01:03:09.330 --> 01:03:12.170
Then I put a cutoff
in the epsilon.

01:03:12.170 --> 01:03:13.890
And this becomes
[? tz ?] square.

01:03:25.670 --> 01:03:28.920
And now I can do this scaling
to express in terms of y.

01:03:32.450 --> 01:03:36.060
And then this becomes
square root lambda pi 1

01:03:36.060 --> 01:03:45.986
over z 0 t y over 1
all over y square.

01:03:49.914 --> 01:03:56.680
[? of ?] [? 4. ?] So
minus 1 over epsilon.

01:03:56.680 --> 01:03:59.860
For simplicity, I will slightly
rewrite this 1 over epsilon

01:03:59.860 --> 01:04:04.900
into the following
thing just as a contrast

01:04:04.900 --> 01:04:09.630
as from infinite, epsilon
divided by z zero dy divided

01:04:09.630 --> 01:04:10.410
by y squared.

01:04:15.980 --> 01:04:17.400
You can easily do this integral.

01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:20.697
This integral you
integrate as 1 over y.

01:04:20.697 --> 01:04:22.030
And the other end it give you 0.

01:04:22.030 --> 01:04:25.730
Lower end they give you
z 0 divided by epsilon.

01:04:25.730 --> 01:04:28.050
And then z 0 cancels with z 0.

01:04:28.050 --> 01:04:31.770
So you just get 1 over epsilon.

01:04:31.770 --> 01:04:35.860
But the reason to
write in this form

01:04:35.860 --> 01:04:39.780
is to see that this two
singularity indeed cancel.

01:04:39.780 --> 01:04:42.330
So these have a singularity.

01:04:42.330 --> 01:04:46.030
As y goes to 0, this
is non-integrable.

01:04:46.030 --> 01:04:47.840
And here you have
the same singularity.

01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:50.430
They cancel.

01:04:50.430 --> 01:04:52.850
So when [? d ?] over [? y ?]
equal to 0, they cancel,

01:04:52.850 --> 01:04:56.520
and the next order term come
from by expanding this term.

01:04:56.520 --> 01:04:59.850
Then you get the y to the power
4 when you expand to this term.

01:04:59.850 --> 01:05:02.870
[? In the upstair ?] you
get 1 over y power 4.

01:05:02.870 --> 01:05:05.530
[? Other ?] than that, will
give you something finite.

01:05:05.530 --> 01:05:07.400
So that just tells
you immediately

01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:10.530
see that the singularity
have canceled.

01:05:10.530 --> 01:05:14.440
So you will guaranteed
to get something finite.

01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:16.870
You are guaranteed to
get something finite.

01:05:16.870 --> 01:05:20.300
And another reason
to write in this form

01:05:20.300 --> 01:05:23.280
is that this is
[? something ?] integrate to 1,

01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:26.266
and this is something
integrate to infinity,

01:05:26.266 --> 01:05:27.890
even though the
difference between them

01:05:27.890 --> 01:05:32.530
is negative, because you have
agreed to do the calculation.

01:05:32.530 --> 01:05:37.970
But this is because integrand
is not exactly the same.

01:05:37.970 --> 01:05:39.970
But the fact that this
is going to infinite

01:05:39.970 --> 01:05:42.160
give you a chance that
this become active.

01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:45.740
And when you calculate
it, it indeed negative.

01:05:45.740 --> 01:05:50.050
And the [INAUDIBLE],
literally you can do it.

01:05:50.050 --> 01:05:51.976
Yeah.

01:05:51.976 --> 01:05:53.350
So you can write
down the answer.

01:05:53.350 --> 01:05:55.516
You find the answer is given
by something like this.

01:05:55.516 --> 01:05:58.390
It's minus square root
lambda divided by pi,

01:05:58.390 --> 01:06:02.421
then some numerical factor,
which is not very important,

01:06:02.421 --> 01:06:03.670
but let me just write it down.

01:06:08.621 --> 01:06:09.370
To the power of 4.

01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:24.890
So this answer is nice.

01:06:24.890 --> 01:06:27.880
So then now let me make
some final remarks.

01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:31.170
So this is finite and negative.

01:06:34.860 --> 01:06:39.009
So this pass the minimal
consistency check

01:06:39.009 --> 01:06:40.550
that we are doing
something sensible.

01:06:43.662 --> 01:06:44.995
We are doing something sensible.

01:06:44.995 --> 01:06:48.860
If we find something
infinite, then that proposal

01:06:48.860 --> 01:06:49.510
must be wrong.

01:06:49.510 --> 01:06:51.632
You can immediately rule it out.

01:06:51.632 --> 01:06:53.090
And if you find
something positive,

01:06:53.090 --> 01:06:55.640
then you can also
immediately rule it out.

01:06:55.640 --> 01:07:00.860
And so this is a
self-consistency check.

01:07:00.860 --> 01:07:06.350
Oh, I forgot the
1 over y at z 0.

01:07:06.350 --> 01:07:10.530
Oh, actually, if you
plug in the 1 over z 0,

01:07:10.530 --> 01:07:13.470
I think you just--
no no, no, no.

01:07:13.470 --> 01:07:14.555
I write it wrong.

01:07:14.555 --> 01:07:15.180
This is not pi.

01:07:15.180 --> 01:07:19.990
This is L. So I have
already plugged in z 0.

01:07:19.990 --> 01:07:21.860
So z 0 is given by this.

01:07:21.860 --> 01:07:28.770
It's proportionate to L.
And then this is 1 over L.

01:07:28.770 --> 01:07:32.226
So this 1 over L is also
makes sense physically,

01:07:32.226 --> 01:07:34.570
because 1 over L is just
the cooling potential.

01:07:39.300 --> 01:07:42.240
And we do expect the
cooling potential,

01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:46.580
because [INAUDIBLE]
as we said is a scale

01:07:46.580 --> 01:07:48.640
[? invariant ?] theory.

01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:51.800
And in four-dimensional
scale, [? invariant ?] series,

01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:54.740
potential just [INAUDIBLE] the
[? ground ?] it will be 1 over

01:07:54.740 --> 01:07:57.520
L, just by scaling symmetry.

01:07:57.520 --> 01:08:00.090
It just exactly
[INAUDIBLE] [? why ?]

01:08:00.090 --> 01:08:02.955
[? electromagnetism ?]
is 1 over L.

01:08:02.955 --> 01:08:08.167
And so this just from
the scale invariance.

01:08:08.167 --> 01:08:09.125
There's no other scale.

01:08:11.770 --> 01:08:14.360
So the dependence on
L must be 1 over L,

01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:17.850
because we have dimension mass.

01:08:17.850 --> 01:08:19.475
So they cannot have
other L dependence.

01:08:23.399 --> 01:08:27.859
So the second point is now we
again see this proportional

01:08:27.859 --> 01:08:28.775
to square root lambda.

01:08:31.670 --> 01:08:34.175
Again, this is a strong
coupling with that.

01:08:40.170 --> 01:08:52.130
Because at weak
coupling, we know

01:08:52.130 --> 01:08:56.720
it must be [? proportional ?]
to lambda divided by L.

01:08:56.720 --> 01:09:00.540
And lambda is just the analog
of the fine structure constant.

01:09:00.540 --> 01:09:03.399
And then this is the
cooling potential.

01:09:03.399 --> 01:09:14.920
So 1 over L is always
true, no matter

01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:17.010
the value of the coupling.

01:09:17.010 --> 01:09:22.080
So you see, when you [INAUDIBLE]
the coupling from lambda

01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:24.574
equal to 0, then it should
be linear in lambda.

01:09:24.574 --> 01:09:25.990
Then when lambda
goes to infinity,

01:09:25.990 --> 01:09:27.573
then become the
square root in lambda.

01:09:34.670 --> 01:09:35.670
So now the final remark.

01:09:39.060 --> 01:09:47.410
[INAUDIBLE] we see that z 0 is
proportional to L. So now let's

01:09:47.410 --> 01:09:51.229
look at the geometrical
meaning of this z 0.

01:09:51.229 --> 01:09:59.260
So this z 0 is how far a string
extends into the [? back. ?]

01:09:59.260 --> 01:10:05.055
So if you say L is
small, then z 0 is small.

01:10:10.970 --> 01:10:17.180
Now if L is large, if I make L
large, then z 0 become bigger.

01:10:17.180 --> 01:10:18.930
That means that the
string extends further

01:10:18.930 --> 01:10:23.200
into the [? back. ?] And when
you take L goes to infinity,

01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:26.865
and this go all
the way to the AdS.

01:10:29.970 --> 01:10:32.410
And again this is the
refraction of IR/UV.

01:10:35.290 --> 01:10:42.790
Refraction of IR/UV,
because L corresponding

01:10:42.790 --> 01:10:44.720
to whether you measure
UV physics or IR

01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:46.630
physics in the field series.

01:10:46.630 --> 01:10:48.430
So L small is a short
distance. [INAUDIBLE]

01:10:48.430 --> 01:10:50.470
is long-distance physics.

01:10:50.470 --> 01:10:55.140
And you see when you probe
long-distance physics,

01:10:55.140 --> 01:11:01.150
then you are probing much
deeper in the interior in AdS.

01:11:01.150 --> 01:11:03.190
And if you're looking
at short distance,

01:11:03.190 --> 01:11:05.810
then you're probing the region
very close to the boundary.

01:11:09.630 --> 01:11:11.820
Any questions on this?

01:11:11.820 --> 01:11:12.580
Yes.

01:11:12.580 --> 01:11:14.376
AUDIENCE: So are there any
interesting experimental

01:11:14.376 --> 01:11:15.917
implications of
these sorts of things

01:11:15.917 --> 01:11:18.540
that we couldn't get otherwise?

01:11:18.540 --> 01:11:22.426
Could we have known these
four facts basically

01:11:22.426 --> 01:11:24.050
without doing this
calculation by doing

01:11:24.050 --> 01:11:25.790
more standard techniques?

01:11:25.790 --> 01:11:27.040
HONG LIU: You mean this thing?

01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:27.800
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:30.730
HONG LIU: No.

01:11:30.730 --> 01:11:33.344
Yeah, so this is really
strong coupling prediction.

01:11:33.344 --> 01:11:35.010
AUDIENCE: So what
would that correspond?

01:11:35.010 --> 01:11:36.684
What sort of thing
could you measure

01:11:36.684 --> 01:11:38.205
in nature that would sort of--?

01:11:38.205 --> 01:11:38.830
HONG LIU: Yeah.

01:11:38.830 --> 01:11:43.310
So then what you would
do in your p-set.

01:11:43.310 --> 01:11:45.090
So in your p-set,
in the last problem,

01:11:45.090 --> 01:11:48.080
you will calculate this thing
at the finite temperature,

01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:53.380
which we will talk of finite
temperature in a few minutes.

01:11:53.380 --> 01:11:55.630
You do it in the
finite temperature.

01:11:55.630 --> 01:11:59.780
And then you can essentially
calculate this potential

01:11:59.780 --> 01:12:02.024
at the finite temperature.

01:12:02.024 --> 01:12:03.690
And as you will do
in the p-set, there's

01:12:03.690 --> 01:12:05.065
a [? screening ?] length.

01:12:05.065 --> 01:12:07.440
And the finite temperature is
no longer scale invariance.

01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:10.800
Beyond a certain length, the
potential will go to zero.

01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:12.540
And you can measure
the screening length.

01:12:12.540 --> 01:12:14.500
And people on the
[? lattice, ?] [? QCD ?],

01:12:14.500 --> 01:12:16.080
that precisely match with that.

01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:18.160
So you can compare
AdS calculation

01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:24.240
to the strongly coupled
[? QCD ?] calculation,

01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:27.920
spend a huge amount of computing
time, large amount of money,

01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:30.520
large amount of
manpower on the computer

01:12:30.520 --> 01:12:33.580
to do that kind of Wilson loop
calculation on the computer.

01:12:33.580 --> 01:12:37.938
And then you see the
answer is very similar.

01:12:37.938 --> 01:12:38.910
Yeah.

01:12:38.910 --> 01:12:41.826
AUDIENCE: That's interesting.

01:12:41.826 --> 01:12:47.047
[INAUDIBLE] the strong
coupling I guess

01:12:47.047 --> 01:12:48.630
is proportional to
square root lambda.

01:12:48.630 --> 01:12:51.001
But the square
root of lambda was

01:12:51.001 --> 01:12:52.375
what you said from
the beginning,

01:12:52.375 --> 01:12:55.782
because [INAUDIBLE]
of the alpha prime.

01:12:55.782 --> 01:12:57.630
It does not involve
the calculation at all.

01:12:57.630 --> 01:13:00.200
So this [INAUDIBLE] produce
a weak coupling result.

01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:00.950
HONG LIU: Oh sure.

01:13:00.950 --> 01:13:01.780
Sure.

01:13:01.780 --> 01:13:04.850
Because we are calculating
a strong coupling.

01:13:04.850 --> 01:13:07.430
Because we are calculating
the strong coupling.

01:13:07.430 --> 01:13:08.050
Yeah.

01:13:08.050 --> 01:13:10.884
So this whole set-up is
for the strong coupling.

01:13:10.884 --> 01:13:14.710
AUDIENCE: So this [INAUDIBLE].

01:13:14.710 --> 01:13:15.357
HONG LIU: No.

01:13:15.357 --> 01:13:17.440
But weak coupling you can
do [INAUDIBLE] diagrams.

01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:19.480
You don't need this.

01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:22.720
But strong coupling,
we have no other way

01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:26.180
to do this kind of
calculation, other than doing

01:13:26.180 --> 01:13:29.320
massive computer simulation.

01:13:29.320 --> 01:13:33.100
And for some things, you cannot
even do computer calculation.

01:13:33.100 --> 01:13:33.600
Good.

01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:35.551
Any other questions?

01:13:35.551 --> 01:13:36.050
Yeah.

01:13:36.050 --> 01:13:37.910
So this is a good question.

01:13:37.910 --> 01:13:41.280
So this actually
a very good point.

01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:42.869
So this tells you
on the gravity side,

01:13:42.869 --> 01:13:44.910
essentially anything
involving these [? always ?]

01:13:44.910 --> 01:13:46.743
[? pointing ?] to the
square root of lambda,

01:13:46.743 --> 01:13:48.350
just related one of alpha prime.

01:13:48.350 --> 01:13:48.850
Yeah.

01:13:48.850 --> 01:13:52.385
It just come from
the kinematics.

01:13:52.385 --> 01:13:57.752
Yeah, but [INAUDIBLE] the system
the very nontrivial prediction

01:13:57.752 --> 01:13:59.085
of the strong coupling behavior.

01:14:02.980 --> 01:14:03.480
Good.

01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:09.270
We need to go to the
finite temperature.

01:14:09.270 --> 01:14:12.990
Because I want you to be
able to do your p-set.

01:14:12.990 --> 01:14:18.300
So now we have talked
about how to calculate

01:14:18.300 --> 01:14:20.337
the various observables.

01:14:20.337 --> 01:14:22.920
Now we can pause a little bit
to talk about other generations.

01:14:25.690 --> 01:14:28.770
So the first generalization
is [INAUDIBLE],

01:14:28.770 --> 01:14:31.530
let's do finite temperature,
do a [? langio ?] temperature.

01:14:39.900 --> 01:14:43.160
So so far, we, can
see that so far we

01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:46.970
discussed AdS 5 times [? AdS ?]
5 string series AdS [INAUDIBLE]

01:14:46.970 --> 01:14:49.430
is 5 string.

01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:56.010
In AdS 5 times [? s ?] 5 is
related to [INAUDIBLE] series.

01:15:00.470 --> 01:15:05.980
So we talked about this in
terms of small perturbations.

01:15:05.980 --> 01:15:21.470
The normalizable mode on this
side should map to some state.

01:15:21.470 --> 01:15:24.270
Say you have some
normalizable mode,

01:15:24.270 --> 01:15:27.100
should do [INAUDIBLE]
some states.

01:15:27.100 --> 01:15:28.950
And for example, the pure AdS 5.

01:15:32.066 --> 01:15:33.190
So there's nothing excited.

01:15:33.190 --> 01:15:37.140
This is example of
this [INAUDIBLE] kind

01:15:37.140 --> 01:15:40.610
of normalizable mode.

01:15:40.610 --> 01:15:43.349
So this is should be
due to the vacuum,

01:15:43.349 --> 01:15:45.390
because nothing excited
on the field series side.

01:15:45.390 --> 01:15:48.770
So this must be
due to the vacuum.

01:15:48.770 --> 01:15:52.590
So now start with
this pure AdS 5.

01:15:52.590 --> 01:15:56.430
Now as you start putting things
inside, excited the system,

01:15:56.430 --> 01:16:01.760
then you will say in some sense
excite some normalizable modes.

01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:06.560
Then you go to excited states
in your [INAUDIBLE] series.

01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:09.325
And then one of the
obvious excited states

01:16:09.325 --> 01:16:12.150
is the finite
temperature states.

01:16:12.150 --> 01:16:14.945
So the obvious question is
what does the thermal state

01:16:14.945 --> 01:16:15.564
correspond to?

01:16:26.030 --> 01:16:26.530
Yeah.

01:16:26.530 --> 01:16:27.863
corresponding to just save time.

01:16:32.300 --> 01:16:34.549
So the gravity description
should have satisfied

01:16:34.549 --> 01:16:35.590
the following conditions.

01:16:46.770 --> 01:16:49.447
To satisfy the
following features.

01:16:49.447 --> 01:16:51.030
So now we want to
guess what should be

01:16:51.030 --> 01:16:53.620
the thing on the gravity side.

01:16:53.620 --> 01:16:58.416
First he said it should
be asymptotic AdS 5.

01:17:02.230 --> 01:17:04.565
That means that there should
be only normalizable modes.

01:17:09.850 --> 01:17:11.650
There should be only
normalizable mode,

01:17:11.650 --> 01:17:14.730
because the finite temperature
state is a specific state

01:17:14.730 --> 01:17:16.410
of the field series.

01:17:16.410 --> 01:17:21.120
So there should be no
non-normalizable modes excited.

01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:28.300
And of course if the
field series have

01:17:28.300 --> 01:17:30.300
a finite temperature,
the other side

01:17:30.300 --> 01:17:32.680
must also have a
finite temperature.

01:17:32.680 --> 01:17:35.705
So it must have a
finite temperature.

01:17:39.340 --> 01:17:41.280
So now I use T means
the temperature.

01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:44.690
Now the capital T
means the temperature.

01:17:44.690 --> 01:17:49.425
And in particular,
this should satisfy

01:17:49.425 --> 01:17:50.550
all laws of thermodynamics.

01:18:03.451 --> 01:18:04.950
And the third one
is that you should

01:18:04.950 --> 01:18:08.320
have of course all
of the symmetries

01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:10.070
of the finite
temperature system.

01:18:10.070 --> 01:18:12.910
So you should have translation
variance, rotational symmetry,

01:18:12.910 --> 01:18:15.200
et cetera.

01:18:15.200 --> 01:18:18.810
Of course, a Lorentz symmetry,
Lorentz boost would be broken.

01:18:18.810 --> 01:18:24.023
So you still should have
translation symmetry

01:18:24.023 --> 01:18:25.273
and the rotational symmetries.

01:18:29.560 --> 01:18:31.604
But the boost will be
broken, because now when

01:18:31.604 --> 01:18:34.020
you add finite temperature,
you no longer have the Lorentz

01:18:34.020 --> 01:18:35.820
boost.

01:18:35.820 --> 01:18:38.300
So you need to find some
kind of gravity solution

01:18:38.300 --> 01:18:44.015
which will satisfy
those criteria.

01:18:44.015 --> 01:18:45.515
So there are two
obvious candidates.

01:19:06.104 --> 01:19:07.270
So there are two candidates.

01:19:16.094 --> 01:19:17.760
So the first is just
you can see there's

01:19:17.760 --> 01:19:24.680
some kind of thermal gas in AdS.

01:19:28.610 --> 01:19:32.435
So just imagine I have
some thermal gas in AdS.

01:19:32.435 --> 01:19:34.810
And the second possibility is
that you have a black hole.

01:19:38.030 --> 01:19:41.539
Because we also know a black
hole is a thermal object.

01:19:41.539 --> 01:19:43.372
We also know black hole
is a thermal object.

01:19:51.730 --> 01:19:55.110
So it turns out so
we will only consider

01:19:55.110 --> 01:19:56.735
the [INAUDIBLE]
[? patch. ?] So we only

01:19:56.735 --> 01:20:03.280
consider the boundaries is
really the r [INAUDIBLE]

01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:05.550
rather than the [INAUDIBLE].

01:20:05.550 --> 01:20:06.650
So the thermal gas.

01:20:06.650 --> 01:20:09.360
So let me first describe the
thermal gas, a description.

01:20:14.909 --> 01:20:16.700
So normally in the
field series, how do you

01:20:16.700 --> 01:20:17.950
describe a thermal system?

01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:25.640
So how would you describe
a thermal system?

01:20:25.640 --> 01:20:27.560
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:20:27.560 --> 01:20:29.583
HONG LIU: In field series.

01:20:29.583 --> 01:20:30.940
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:20:30.940 --> 01:20:33.270
HONG LIU: Yeah.

01:20:33.270 --> 01:20:36.965
A partition function is one
observable of a thermal system.

01:20:36.965 --> 01:20:39.590
Say if you want to describe the
thermal system in field series,

01:20:39.590 --> 01:20:40.907
what do you do?

01:20:40.907 --> 01:20:42.990
Say if you want to calculate
correlation function,

01:20:42.990 --> 01:20:45.390
you want to calculate
many other things?

01:20:45.390 --> 01:20:47.230
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
Euclidean [INAUDIBLE]?

01:20:47.230 --> 01:20:48.430
HONG LIU: Exactly.

01:20:48.430 --> 01:20:51.760
So normally in the field
series, what you do

01:20:51.760 --> 01:20:55.070
is that you go to Euclidean
signature, and then

01:20:55.070 --> 01:20:57.060
periodically identify time.

01:20:57.060 --> 01:21:00.450
And the period of time is
the inverse temperature.

01:21:00.450 --> 01:21:01.340
So we can do it here.

01:21:01.340 --> 01:21:04.530
The thermal gassing idea is
essentially is what we do.

01:21:04.530 --> 01:21:06.660
You say we go to the
Euclidean signature.

01:21:13.860 --> 01:21:17.190
Yeah, let me call it t E.
We go to Euclidean time.

01:21:22.930 --> 01:21:25.880
We go to Euclidean time.

01:21:25.880 --> 01:21:32.270
And then we identify
Euclidean time periodically

01:21:32.270 --> 01:21:34.595
with inverse temperature,
which we always call beta.

01:21:37.440 --> 01:21:41.190
And so in particular, the
fermions is anti-periodic.

01:21:45.857 --> 01:21:46.440
Anti-periodic.

01:21:53.980 --> 01:21:56.520
That means anti-periodic.

01:21:56.520 --> 01:22:00.150
Of course, the
Boson is periodic.

01:22:00.150 --> 01:22:04.710
But actually, this metric is
bad for the following reason.

01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:16.900
So in gravity as a
general rule, whenever

01:22:16.900 --> 01:22:22.060
you see a compact
space go to 0 sites,

01:22:22.060 --> 01:22:26.160
then there's a danger of
having a curvature singularity.

01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:28.620
It's almost always you have
a curvature singularity.

01:22:28.620 --> 01:22:32.440
Only for some special
situations it does not have it.

01:22:32.440 --> 01:22:36.800
And so this is bad,
because now when

01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:38.510
you compactify this
Euclidean time,

01:22:38.510 --> 01:22:40.200
this become a compact direction.

01:22:40.200 --> 01:22:41.910
This is a circle.

01:22:41.910 --> 01:22:44.550
And when you go to
z goes to infinity,

01:22:44.550 --> 01:22:47.099
this circle goes to zero sides.

01:22:47.099 --> 01:22:48.640
You can check that
actually this have

01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:51.530
more curvature singularity.

01:22:51.530 --> 01:22:53.320
So this is actually bad.

01:22:53.320 --> 01:22:56.260
So when t is
uncompact, then this

01:22:56.260 --> 01:22:58.550
is a coordinate singularity.

01:22:58.550 --> 01:23:01.200
But when t become
compact, and then this

01:23:01.200 --> 01:23:02.863
become a [? general ?]
singularity.

01:23:02.863 --> 01:23:04.446
This become [? general ?]
singularity.

01:23:08.730 --> 01:23:12.560
So first this metric's bad,
because I have singularity.

01:23:18.772 --> 01:23:19.730
At z equal to infinity.

01:23:22.730 --> 01:23:26.200
At deep in the interior of AdS.

01:23:26.200 --> 01:23:29.140
There's also a second reason,
which is more stringent reason,

01:23:29.140 --> 01:23:31.890
which you don't need to care.

01:23:31.890 --> 01:23:36.400
Let me just write it
down for completeness.

01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:38.280
So if you actually
analyze a string theory

01:23:38.280 --> 01:23:41.380
in such kind of space time.

01:23:41.380 --> 01:23:47.150
So also there's a generic
rule in string theory

01:23:47.150 --> 01:23:50.430
is that if you have a
very small circle, then

01:23:50.430 --> 01:23:53.570
the string can wind
around the circle.

01:23:53.570 --> 01:23:56.440
The string can wind
around the circle.

01:23:56.440 --> 01:23:59.890
And then when that circle
become very, very small,

01:23:59.890 --> 01:24:02.430
then it takes less and
less energy for string

01:24:02.430 --> 01:24:03.817
to wind around that circle.

01:24:07.170 --> 01:24:10.420
And then normally, so if
you have supersymmetry,

01:24:10.420 --> 01:24:13.800
and also you have a
string wind around circle,

01:24:13.800 --> 01:24:16.430
there's a [? casmir energy. ?]
And the [? casmir ?] energy is

01:24:16.430 --> 01:24:18.300
typically is inactive
for the Boson,

01:24:18.300 --> 01:24:19.657
and the fermion is positive.

01:24:19.657 --> 01:24:22.240
And if you have a supersymmetry,
then that [? casmir ?] energy

01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:23.220
cancels.

01:24:23.220 --> 01:24:26.590
And then when the circle
shrink to zero size,

01:24:26.590 --> 01:24:28.550
then the string become massless.

01:24:28.550 --> 01:24:31.210
So that's typical
in the superstring.

01:24:31.210 --> 01:24:35.090
But if you in the situation
where you just saw a symmetry's

01:24:35.090 --> 01:24:37.100
broken, then
typically then there's

01:24:37.100 --> 01:24:40.060
an active
[? casmir image. ?] And then

01:24:40.060 --> 01:24:45.977
when the circle side
becomes smaller and smaller,

01:24:45.977 --> 01:24:48.060
and then it take lower and
lower energy for string

01:24:48.060 --> 01:24:49.540
to wrap around circle.

01:24:49.540 --> 01:24:52.719
And then anyway,
if you include the

01:24:52.719 --> 01:24:55.010
[? casmir image, et cetera, ?]
then you find the string

01:24:55.010 --> 01:24:57.370
actually become
[? negative image. ?]

01:24:57.370 --> 01:25:11.540
And you find that the
strings winding around t E

01:25:11.540 --> 01:25:16.980
actually develops
negative mass square.

01:25:21.760 --> 01:25:24.660
So as we discussed before,
this is called [INAUDIBLE],

01:25:24.660 --> 01:25:26.770
and signals instability.

01:25:26.770 --> 01:25:31.062
And here there's a circle
which become a small size.

01:25:31.062 --> 01:25:33.020
And here there's no
supersymmetry, because when

01:25:33.020 --> 01:25:35.519
you have a finite temperature,
your supersymmetry is broken,

01:25:35.519 --> 01:25:40.690
because both on fermion have
different boundary conditions.

01:25:40.690 --> 01:25:46.090
Anyway, so that means that this
option is gone, cannot work.

01:25:46.090 --> 01:25:48.090
So the only thing we know
is to do a black hole.

01:25:50.570 --> 01:25:53.070
So now we need to find a black
hole with the right symmetry.

01:26:08.410 --> 01:26:10.820
So the reason I emphasized
with the right symmetry is

01:26:10.820 --> 01:26:14.120
because when we say
black hole, it's

01:26:14.120 --> 01:26:17.500
because a black hole is
a hole, is a [INAUDIBLE]

01:26:17.500 --> 01:26:20.390
symmetric hole.

01:26:20.390 --> 01:26:26.000
But here we need to have
a translation symmetry,

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:29.320
because this is a [INAUDIBLE].

01:26:29.320 --> 01:26:32.990
So here now we need
to have a black brain,

01:26:32.990 --> 01:26:34.209
black the whole horizon.

01:26:34.209 --> 01:26:35.250
It's actually not a hole.

01:26:35.250 --> 01:26:37.940
It's actually a plane.

01:26:37.940 --> 01:26:43.260
So I did the black
hole in this topology

01:26:43.260 --> 01:26:46.855
for the horizon topology.

01:26:50.260 --> 01:26:56.320
Topology should be r to the d
minus 1, rather than a sphere.

01:27:03.050 --> 01:27:07.040
Once you've realized that,
then it's easy to do.

01:27:07.040 --> 01:27:10.080
Once you realize
that, it's easy to do.

01:27:10.080 --> 01:27:14.130
So you can just write down the
answers, because this system

01:27:14.130 --> 01:27:16.854
have lots of symmetries.

01:27:16.854 --> 01:27:18.520
And you can just write
down the answers,

01:27:18.520 --> 01:27:23.242
and then just plug into the
Einstein equation to solve it.

01:27:23.242 --> 01:27:25.200
Say for example you can
write down the answers.

01:27:27.860 --> 01:27:30.540
So you can write
down say r square.

01:27:30.540 --> 01:27:33.640
So you can write down
answer's ds square equal

01:27:33.640 --> 01:27:37.250
to r squared
divided by z square.

01:27:37.250 --> 01:27:42.930
So now you still get
translation symmetry,

01:27:42.930 --> 01:27:46.080
so you can put something
before dt square.

01:27:46.080 --> 01:27:48.170
But you still have
rotation symmetry.

01:27:48.170 --> 01:27:52.780
Yeah, so anyway, you can
write down answers like this.

01:27:52.780 --> 01:27:54.310
Put in some two functions here.

01:28:00.070 --> 01:28:01.420
Put in some two functions here.

01:28:01.420 --> 01:28:03.860
So this is a most
general solution,

01:28:03.860 --> 01:28:06.450
which is consistent with the
translation symmetry in the t

01:28:06.450 --> 01:28:09.221
and x direction, and the
rotational symmetry in the t

01:28:09.221 --> 01:28:09.930
and x directions.

01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:15.240
And then you have
just two functions

01:28:15.240 --> 01:28:16.500
which can only depend on z.

01:28:16.500 --> 01:28:18.720
You cannot depend on t and x.

01:28:18.720 --> 01:28:20.619
Otherwise you'll break
translation symmetry.

01:28:20.619 --> 01:28:22.660
So these are the most
[? general ?] [? metric ?],

01:28:22.660 --> 01:28:24.820
you have two
undetermined functions.

01:28:24.820 --> 01:28:26.830
Then you plug into
Einstein equation.

01:28:26.830 --> 01:28:27.640
Then you solve it.

01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:44.510
So you find in fact h
actually equal to 1 over g

01:28:44.510 --> 01:28:47.900
equal to something like this.

01:28:47.900 --> 01:28:49.860
It's in d-dimension.

01:28:49.860 --> 01:28:53.710
In d-dimension, say if
I have AdS d plus, 1

01:28:53.710 --> 01:28:56.250
and then you find a very
simple [? metric ?] like this.

01:29:02.980 --> 01:29:08.130
So let me again give
you a slight quiz.

01:29:08.130 --> 01:29:09.622
So why I don't put
a function here?

01:29:15.090 --> 01:29:20.557
So why in principle, I can also
put a function here, right?

01:29:20.557 --> 01:29:22.890
So why I only put a function
here and the function here,

01:29:22.890 --> 01:29:24.330
but not put the function here?

01:29:24.330 --> 01:29:26.330
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
[? Because it redefines ?]

01:29:26.330 --> 01:29:26.950
[? z. ?]

01:29:26.950 --> 01:29:28.260
HONG LIU: Yeah, exactly.

01:29:28.260 --> 01:29:34.000
Because you can imagine this
just as a definition of z.

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:37.150
But then I don't have
freedom to choose this z.

01:29:37.150 --> 01:29:39.240
Or I can choose here
to be 1, and then I

01:29:39.240 --> 01:29:40.611
need to put the function there.

01:29:43.910 --> 01:29:53.960
So in this metric, the horizon
we set z is equal to z 0.

01:29:53.960 --> 01:29:55.840
z 0 is some constant.

01:29:55.840 --> 01:29:57.645
So z 0 is some constant.

01:30:01.210 --> 01:30:02.940
Zero some constant.

01:30:02.940 --> 01:30:03.440
Right.

01:30:03.440 --> 01:30:04.250
Is z 0.

01:30:04.250 --> 01:30:09.320
And indeed I have a
topology of the R t minus 1,

01:30:09.320 --> 01:30:13.550
because [? the d, ?] z equal to
0, the topology is at this r.

01:30:13.550 --> 01:30:14.600
It's not at the sphere.

01:30:17.560 --> 01:30:24.400
And also you see that when you
go to infinity, the f and the g

01:30:24.400 --> 01:30:30.089
approach 1 with a very fast
fall-off with d to the power d.

01:30:30.089 --> 01:30:31.255
So this is the normalizable.

01:30:33.880 --> 01:30:35.110
And this is normalizable.

01:30:35.110 --> 01:30:37.616
So this behavior
is normalizable.

01:30:48.810 --> 01:30:54.690
So this is metric satisfy
all our criterions.

01:30:54.690 --> 01:30:57.570
And under the standard
black hole thermodynamics,

01:30:57.570 --> 01:30:59.620
we are sure this is a
thermodynamical system.

01:31:02.430 --> 01:31:09.317
So this must be [? due ?] to our
finite temperature [INAUDIBLE]

01:31:09.317 --> 01:31:09.817
series.

01:31:14.180 --> 01:31:18.310
So now let's work out the
temperature in terms of z 0.

01:31:18.310 --> 01:31:23.190
So it's just using
the standard trick

01:31:23.190 --> 01:31:32.225
going to the Euclidean signature
which we have discussed before.

01:31:35.160 --> 01:31:42.664
And the required the metric
is regular at the horizon.

01:31:42.664 --> 01:31:44.080
When you go to
Euclidean signature

01:31:44.080 --> 01:31:46.640
require the metric is
regular at the horizon.

01:31:46.640 --> 01:31:51.060
And then you can
deduce that this should

01:31:51.060 --> 01:31:54.710
have some specific periodicity.

01:31:54.710 --> 01:31:58.070
Anyway, I hope you
still remember that.

01:31:58.070 --> 01:32:03.720
So you can deduce a
temperature of the black hole.

01:32:03.720 --> 01:32:10.100
So beta is equal to 4
pi to the d times z 0.

01:32:13.370 --> 01:32:16.340
So you can deduce.

01:32:16.340 --> 01:32:19.065
So this you remember, right?

01:32:19.065 --> 01:32:19.565
OK.

01:32:19.565 --> 01:32:20.065
Good.

01:32:25.750 --> 01:32:30.496
So emphasize this is the
temperature matched in t.

01:32:30.496 --> 01:32:32.954
Because whenever, as we
emphasized many times before,

01:32:32.954 --> 01:32:34.620
but whenever you talk
about temperature,

01:32:34.620 --> 01:32:38.280
you have to refer to
a time, time units

01:32:38.280 --> 01:32:40.200
to define the temperature.

01:32:40.200 --> 01:32:44.240
And this temperature is defined
with respect to this time.

01:32:44.240 --> 01:32:46.940
So in other words, this
is boundary temperature.

01:32:55.280 --> 01:32:57.920
So in the [? back ?], of course,
depending on the value of z,

01:32:57.920 --> 01:33:00.270
the local temperature
is different.

01:33:00.270 --> 01:33:02.978
And this is the temperature
corresponding to the boundary.

01:33:09.670 --> 01:33:13.080
So this relation is
again very interesting.

01:33:17.550 --> 01:33:30.530
So this is z equal
to 0 boundary.

01:33:30.530 --> 01:33:34.080
And now on the gravity side
now there's a horizon at

01:33:34.080 --> 01:33:40.000
z equal to 0, z equal to z 0.

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:43.100
And this horizon
according to this formula

01:33:43.100 --> 01:33:45.026
is proportional to 1 over t.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.980
It's proportional to 1 over t.

01:33:55.980 --> 01:33:58.915
Again, this is the refraction
of the IR/UV connection.

01:34:02.080 --> 01:34:08.090
Because if you can see
the very high temperature,

01:34:08.090 --> 01:34:12.740
it means you are probing
very high energy process.

01:34:12.740 --> 01:34:14.935
Then the z 0 becomes small.

01:34:14.935 --> 01:34:16.560
Then the horizon
moves to the boundary.

01:34:20.240 --> 01:34:22.230
And the horizon moves
to the boundary.

01:34:22.230 --> 01:34:25.290
And when t becomes small,
then z 0 becomes big,

01:34:25.290 --> 01:34:26.430
then the horizon move down.

01:34:29.720 --> 01:34:32.090
So that means that
depending on the value of t,

01:34:32.090 --> 01:34:35.260
you can probe different
regions in the gravity side.

01:34:35.260 --> 01:34:37.100
So for very high
temperature, you

01:34:37.100 --> 01:34:40.200
probe very tiny region
near the infinity.

01:34:40.200 --> 01:34:43.440
And for a small t, you can
probe one or more regions.

01:34:43.440 --> 01:34:44.940
Again this is a
refraction of IR/UV.

01:34:49.960 --> 01:34:52.320
Any questions on this?

01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:53.759
Now with this black
hole solution,

01:34:53.759 --> 01:34:55.550
we can work out
[INAUDIBLE] thermodynamics.

01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:05.392
And then we should be able to
work essentially by definition.

01:35:05.392 --> 01:35:07.100
Then, for example,
the black hole entropy

01:35:07.100 --> 01:35:10.580
should be identified with
the field series entropy,

01:35:10.580 --> 01:35:12.070
or black hole free
energy should be

01:35:12.070 --> 01:35:16.120
identified with the free field
series for energy, et cetera.

01:35:16.120 --> 01:35:18.970
It just essentially,
if there's a relation,

01:35:18.970 --> 01:35:22.420
if black hole describe the field
series at finite temperature,

01:35:22.420 --> 01:35:24.630
then you should
be able to equate

01:35:24.630 --> 01:35:28.040
the thermodynamic quantities.

01:35:28.040 --> 01:35:30.460
And in this way, we can
actually use the black hole

01:35:30.460 --> 01:35:34.190
thermodynamics now to calculate
the thermodynamical behavior

01:35:34.190 --> 01:35:38.150
of a strongly coupled
[INAUDIBLE] series.

01:35:38.150 --> 01:35:45.705
So we can now obtain
thermodynamical behavior,

01:35:45.705 --> 01:36:02.280
thermodynamical quantities
at strong coupling

01:36:02.280 --> 01:36:06.520
in the [INAUDIBLE]
series in a black hole.

01:36:12.440 --> 01:36:13.980
So now let's do that.

01:36:13.980 --> 01:36:17.950
So now let's specify
to d equal to 4.

01:36:17.950 --> 01:36:20.910
So that's corresponding to the
four-dimensional boundaries,

01:36:20.910 --> 01:36:24.300
and that's [? 2t ?] equal to 4.

01:36:24.300 --> 01:36:27.140
So now let's first do
the black hole entropy,

01:36:27.140 --> 01:36:29.730
which is the
easiest thing to do.

01:36:29.730 --> 01:36:33.810
So the black hole entropy,
just the area of the horizon

01:36:33.810 --> 01:36:36.580
divided by Newton constant.

01:36:36.580 --> 01:36:39.160
So we have to use the factor
of five-dimensional Newton

01:36:39.160 --> 01:36:40.130
constants.

01:36:40.130 --> 01:36:41.790
So we work with AdS 5.

01:36:41.790 --> 01:36:43.990
So we dimension
reduction on the S 5.

01:36:43.990 --> 01:36:48.530
So we work with the
five-dimension Newton constant.

01:36:48.530 --> 01:36:55.790
And then the area here
is just infinite volume.

01:36:55.790 --> 01:37:00.424
It is just dx 1, dx 2, dx 3,
because this is just parallel

01:37:00.424 --> 01:37:01.090
to the boundary.

01:37:01.090 --> 01:37:02.720
It doesn't matter.

01:37:02.720 --> 01:37:05.770
It doesn't matter.

01:37:05.770 --> 01:37:07.890
So what this defines,
or [INAUDIBLE]

01:37:07.890 --> 01:37:17.070
times R cubed to the
z 0 cubed, because you

01:37:17.070 --> 01:37:20.570
have to multiply the
area at the horizon.

01:37:20.570 --> 01:37:24.520
So you essentially compute the
determinant of the spatial part

01:37:24.520 --> 01:37:27.630
at the horizon, you
evaluate it at the z 0.

01:37:27.630 --> 01:37:29.470
You evaluate it at z 0.

01:37:29.470 --> 01:37:31.010
So you have this factor.

01:37:31.010 --> 01:37:33.640
And then you have
this infinite factor.

01:37:33.640 --> 01:37:35.560
But this infinite factor,
it doesn't matter.

01:37:35.560 --> 01:37:37.100
We can just take it out.

01:37:37.100 --> 01:37:40.010
Then what you get is
the entropy density.

01:37:40.010 --> 01:37:48.920
So then we find the entropy
density is essentially

01:37:48.920 --> 01:37:52.490
just given by this R
cubed divided by z 0

01:37:52.490 --> 01:37:55.430
to the cube 4G 5.

01:38:02.150 --> 01:38:05.550
So now you can just
plug in the numbers.

01:38:05.550 --> 01:38:08.890
So now you have to
use this equation.

01:38:08.890 --> 01:38:12.370
G 5 divided by R
cubed is related

01:38:12.370 --> 01:38:18.390
to the [INAUDIBLE] related
to pi divided by 2 N square.

01:38:18.390 --> 01:38:24.860
And then you plug in this
relation to relate z 0 to t.

01:38:24.860 --> 01:38:30.170
And then, after a
tiny bit of algebra,

01:38:30.170 --> 01:38:33.160
so you find N squared T cubed.

01:38:38.860 --> 01:38:41.870
Again this answer makes sense.

01:38:41.870 --> 01:38:45.891
Again, you can do some very
minimal consistency check.

01:38:45.891 --> 01:38:47.390
So first thing you
said is that this

01:38:47.390 --> 01:38:50.230
is proportional to T cubed.

01:38:50.230 --> 01:38:52.110
It makes sense,
because we are working

01:38:52.110 --> 01:38:55.500
with a four-dimensional
scale invariant series.

01:38:55.500 --> 01:38:59.520
And entropy by itself
does not have a dimension.

01:38:59.520 --> 01:39:04.840
And entropy density should
have dimension cubed

01:39:04.840 --> 01:39:06.380
because of the volume.

01:39:06.380 --> 01:39:08.410
You divide it by the volume.

01:39:08.410 --> 01:39:09.409
Should be 1 over volume.

01:39:15.370 --> 01:39:16.410
Do you follow?

01:39:16.410 --> 01:39:18.290
So entropy density
should have dimension.

01:39:20.920 --> 01:39:25.810
Entropy density should
have dimension M d minus 1.

01:39:25.810 --> 01:39:28.940
Because at the d minus 1 come
from because you divide it

01:39:28.940 --> 01:39:32.140
by entropy by the volume,
and the volume have,

01:39:32.140 --> 01:39:34.980
yeah, 1 over volume have
dimension M d minus 1.

01:39:38.900 --> 01:39:40.350
But here in the
scale environment

01:39:40.350 --> 01:39:42.040
you don't have any
of the scale factor.

01:39:42.040 --> 01:39:46.440
You only have T. So it must
come from T to the d minus 1.

01:39:46.440 --> 01:39:48.720
So you get T cubed.

01:39:48.720 --> 01:39:51.340
And also, this is a
proponent to N square.

01:39:51.340 --> 01:39:53.100
And of course in the
[INAUDIBLE] series

01:39:53.100 --> 01:39:54.516
should be [INAUDIBLE]
to N square.

01:39:57.830 --> 01:40:01.710
So now you can also obtain, say
for example, the energy density

01:40:01.710 --> 01:40:06.240
and the pressure, et cetera,
by calculating the T m

01:40:06.240 --> 01:40:09.120
[INAUDIBLE] mu.

01:40:09.120 --> 01:40:11.240
So you can calculate say
one [? point ?] function

01:40:11.240 --> 01:40:12.790
of the stress
tensor Then you can

01:40:12.790 --> 01:40:15.590
read what is the energy
density, and what

01:40:15.590 --> 01:40:17.700
is the pressure, et cetera.

01:40:17.700 --> 01:40:20.560
And so this is the
same as what we did.

01:40:20.560 --> 01:40:24.920
It's very similar procedure
as what we did before

01:40:24.920 --> 01:40:26.810
for the scalar field series.

01:40:26.810 --> 01:40:31.680
The one point function
of the stress tensor,

01:40:31.680 --> 01:40:33.670
you can read it
from the counterpart

01:40:33.670 --> 01:40:37.870
of the [? B ?] modes, a
counterpart of the [INAUDIBLE]

01:40:37.870 --> 01:40:39.150
modes.

01:40:39.150 --> 01:40:43.610
So here the [INAUDIBLE] mode
is just this z to the power d.

01:40:43.610 --> 01:40:46.830
And the [? corruption ?]
is 1 over 0, 1 over z 0

01:40:46.830 --> 01:40:48.310
to the power d.

01:40:48.310 --> 01:40:52.710
And so that tells you you should
be proportional to 1 over z

01:40:52.710 --> 01:40:54.560
to the 0 to the 4.

01:40:58.610 --> 01:41:00.460
Because that's an
analog of this [? B ?]

01:41:00.460 --> 01:41:05.460
mode-- the normalizable mode--
to the 1 over z to the 0 4.

01:41:05.460 --> 01:41:07.480
And again, this will
be proportional to T

01:41:07.480 --> 01:41:08.380
to the power of 4.

01:41:08.380 --> 01:41:11.580
Again, this is consistent
on dimensional ground,

01:41:11.580 --> 01:41:15.280
because energy density have
dimension m to the power d.

01:41:15.280 --> 01:41:18.440
And so it's T to the power 4.

01:41:18.440 --> 01:41:24.730
But you actually work out the
prefactor request [INAUDIBLE]

01:41:24.730 --> 01:41:27.260
effort.

01:41:27.260 --> 01:41:31.930
Yeah, in a scalar case, we
say it's 2 [? mu ?] times b.

01:41:31.930 --> 01:41:34.827
So in the gravity case,
in the [? metric ?] case,

01:41:34.827 --> 01:41:36.410
it gets a little bit
more complicated.

01:41:36.410 --> 01:41:42.330
Anyway, but you
can read the scale.

01:41:42.330 --> 01:41:47.120
I will not calculate the
prefactor using this method.

01:41:47.120 --> 01:41:49.799
So to calculate the
prefactor, it's easier

01:41:49.799 --> 01:41:51.090
just to use the thermodynamics.

01:41:58.820 --> 01:42:10.550
So because S just equal to
the free energy divided by T.

01:42:10.550 --> 01:42:12.590
So now everything
here, we can see

01:42:12.590 --> 01:42:15.090
that the density is
S is entropy density,

01:42:15.090 --> 01:42:18.540
and F is the free energy
density [? exciter. ?]

01:42:18.540 --> 01:42:21.010
So we know now the entropy.

01:42:21.010 --> 01:42:24.394
You can just integrate
the free energy density.

01:42:32.590 --> 01:42:37.670
So this is equal to pi square
divided by 8 N squared T

01:42:37.670 --> 01:42:40.340
to the 4.

01:42:40.340 --> 01:42:46.190
And then you can find out the
energy density of plus TS.

01:42:46.190 --> 01:42:50.990
So you find this 3
pi square [INAUDIBLE]

01:42:50.990 --> 01:42:51.950
squared [INAUDIBLE].

01:43:00.457 --> 01:43:02.290
Now if you work hard,
the one point function

01:43:02.290 --> 01:43:05.385
of the stress tensor carefully
of the [? free ?] factor, you

01:43:05.385 --> 01:43:06.110
will find this.

01:43:09.100 --> 01:43:13.074
So this is, as a result, at
lambda equal to infinity.

01:43:13.074 --> 01:43:14.740
So these are the
strong coupling we got.

01:43:14.740 --> 01:43:16.448
All these are the
strong coupling we got.

01:43:25.027 --> 01:43:25.902
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:43:29.585 --> 01:43:31.210
HONG LIU: The
thermodynamical behavior?

01:43:31.210 --> 01:43:33.020
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
How do you get N?

01:43:33.020 --> 01:43:33.561
HONG LIU: No.

01:43:33.561 --> 01:43:35.980
You just integrate
this equation.

01:43:35.980 --> 01:43:36.480
Yeah.

01:43:36.480 --> 01:43:39.260
Just integrate that equation.

01:43:39.260 --> 01:43:42.510
So this is the behavior,
that infinite lambda.

01:43:42.510 --> 01:43:47.710
So now let's compare
with the free series.

01:43:55.250 --> 01:43:57.500
So this is the undergraduate
thermodynamics.

01:44:01.550 --> 01:44:05.734
So let's just calculate
the entropy density

01:44:05.734 --> 01:44:06.525
with zero coupling.

01:44:09.710 --> 01:44:13.480
So I have to remind
you one thing.

01:44:13.480 --> 01:44:18.630
It said in each massless
[INAUDIBLE] degree of freedom

01:44:18.630 --> 01:44:22.520
contribute to the entropy
density 2 pi square divided

01:44:22.520 --> 01:44:25.610
by 45 to the power T cube.

01:44:25.610 --> 01:44:28.640
I don't know whether you
still remember this thing.

01:44:28.640 --> 01:44:32.130
So in four dimension, a single
massless degree of freedom

01:44:32.130 --> 01:44:35.110
contribute to the
entropy density.

01:44:35.110 --> 01:44:38.490
Yeah, this come from-- doing
a single massless [INAUDIBLE]

01:44:38.490 --> 01:44:41.850
degree of freedom contributed
entropy like this.

01:44:44.450 --> 01:44:47.340
This is a good
thing to remember.

01:44:47.340 --> 01:44:50.850
And now in the
[INAUDIBLE] series

01:44:50.850 --> 01:44:53.170
we have eight Boson,
as we said before.

01:44:53.170 --> 01:44:55.430
We have eight massless
Boson degrees of freedom.

01:44:59.120 --> 01:45:03.820
And then we have eight fermionic
massless degrees of freedom.

01:45:03.820 --> 01:45:08.930
And each fermionic degrees of
freedom contribute to how much

01:45:08.930 --> 01:45:09.935
of the Boson?

01:45:09.935 --> 01:45:13.230
Do anybody know?

01:45:13.230 --> 01:45:15.820
A massless fermion compared
to the massless Boson.

01:45:15.820 --> 01:45:17.871
What is the ratio for
each degrees of freedom

01:45:17.871 --> 01:45:20.120
contributed to the entropy
density in the free series,

01:45:20.120 --> 01:45:21.152
free particle?

01:45:21.152 --> 01:45:22.300
AUDIENCE: One half?

01:45:22.300 --> 01:45:24.170
HONG LIU: No [INAUDIBLE]

01:45:24.170 --> 01:45:24.949
AUDIENCE: One.

01:45:24.949 --> 01:45:25.490
HONG LIU: No.

01:45:25.490 --> 01:45:25.990
7/8.

01:45:30.940 --> 01:45:34.650
And now in the SU(N)
[? Gate ?] series,

01:45:34.650 --> 01:45:36.870
we have N squared minus 1.

01:45:36.870 --> 01:45:40.240
We have N squared minus 1 in
the join [? representation. ?]

01:45:40.240 --> 01:45:43.800
So now you can calculate this
is a [INAUDIBLE] free series.

01:45:43.800 --> 01:45:47.780
So let's take [INAUDIBLE],
forget about the 1.

01:45:47.780 --> 01:45:53.090
So then you get 2
pi over 3, 2/3 pi

01:45:53.090 --> 01:45:56.579
squared N squared T
to the power cubed.

01:45:56.579 --> 01:45:58.120
So now you find
something remarkable.

01:46:01.960 --> 01:46:03.710
So now you find
something remarkable.

01:46:03.710 --> 01:46:07.210
You find S lambda
equal to infinity

01:46:07.210 --> 01:46:12.950
divided by S lambda equal to 0
is equal to 1/2 divided by 2/3.

01:46:12.950 --> 01:46:14.434
So it becomes 3/4.

01:46:21.850 --> 01:46:26.822
So you go from zero coupling
just to infinite coupling,

01:46:26.822 --> 01:46:28.490
and the entropy change by 3/4.

01:46:31.660 --> 01:46:33.290
So there's a long story.

01:46:33.290 --> 01:46:35.230
There are several
long story I can tell,

01:46:35.230 --> 01:46:37.480
a good story I can
tell about this thing.

01:46:37.480 --> 01:46:41.560
But now I run out of time.

01:46:41.560 --> 01:46:49.046
But let me mention a couple
words on your p-set problem.

01:46:49.046 --> 01:46:50.420
So in the p-set
problem, you want

01:46:50.420 --> 01:46:53.160
to compute that this Wilson
loop, the same Wilson

01:46:53.160 --> 01:46:58.480
loop, the L and the T at
the finite temperature.

01:46:58.480 --> 01:47:01.290
So now instead of
the pure AdS, you

01:47:01.290 --> 01:47:03.660
use this black hole geometry.

01:47:03.660 --> 01:47:05.035
You use this black
hole geometry.

01:47:07.570 --> 01:47:09.510
Use this black hole geometry.

01:47:09.510 --> 01:47:16.960
So what you will find,
so physical expectation,

01:47:16.960 --> 01:47:19.790
physically the V(L).

01:47:23.780 --> 01:47:25.820
So you expect the
potential between the quark

01:47:25.820 --> 01:47:30.680
and anti-quark will go
to 0 when L is large.

01:47:37.990 --> 01:47:42.030
So physically for
this reason, so here

01:47:42.030 --> 01:47:44.580
this is the same thing
happens even in the [? QED ?].

01:47:47.500 --> 01:47:49.849
So this is just the
story of the screening.

01:47:49.849 --> 01:47:51.640
Suppose you have
electrons, anti-electrons.

01:47:51.640 --> 01:47:54.100
So of course they have
interaction between them.

01:47:54.100 --> 01:47:55.850
But now if you have a
plasma between them,

01:47:55.850 --> 01:47:57.560
you have many positive
and [INAUDIBLE]

01:47:57.560 --> 01:48:00.870
charge of particles
[INAUDIBLE] running around.

01:48:00.870 --> 01:48:03.635
And then they interacting
will be screened.

01:48:03.635 --> 01:48:05.010
The interaction
will be screened,

01:48:05.010 --> 01:48:06.970
because there will be
slightly more active particle

01:48:06.970 --> 01:48:09.080
here, and slightly more
positive particle here.

01:48:09.080 --> 01:48:10.251
Then they will be screened.

01:48:10.251 --> 01:48:12.500
Similarly, if you have a
quark and an anti-quark which

01:48:12.500 --> 01:48:17.450
[INAUDIBLE] object, and we input
them at the finite temperature,

01:48:17.450 --> 01:48:21.430
in the finite temperature, you
can cite many other massless

01:48:21.430 --> 01:48:23.010
[INAUDIBLE] degrees of freedom.

01:48:23.010 --> 01:48:24.080
Then they running
around [INAUDIBLE]

01:48:24.080 --> 01:48:25.121
quark and the anti-quark.

01:48:25.121 --> 01:48:26.550
Then they will screen them.

01:48:26.550 --> 01:48:30.300
So when they take the
distance sufficiently large,

01:48:30.300 --> 01:48:35.575
then you will find the potential
between them goes to 0.

01:48:35.575 --> 01:48:44.370
So on the gravity side,
what you will see--

01:48:44.370 --> 01:48:50.570
so now you cannot do
everything analytically.

01:48:50.570 --> 01:48:52.480
But you can derive the
qualitative behavior

01:48:52.480 --> 01:48:53.750
analytically.

01:48:53.750 --> 01:48:59.680
It said if the L is small-- so
suppose here is the horizon.

01:48:59.680 --> 01:49:02.360
When the L is small,
then of course

01:49:02.360 --> 01:49:03.660
we just connect a string.

01:49:03.660 --> 01:49:05.790
We're close-by.

01:49:05.790 --> 01:49:06.980
Nothing changes.

01:49:06.980 --> 01:49:11.567
Nothing much changes from our
zero temperature calculation.

01:49:11.567 --> 01:49:13.650
And this makes sense,
because at a short distance,

01:49:13.650 --> 01:49:16.940
you probe the UV physics.

01:49:16.940 --> 01:49:19.010
And the probe, the
UV physics, of course

01:49:19.010 --> 01:49:21.300
you don't see the temperature.

01:49:21.300 --> 01:49:26.120
So for L is much, much smaller
than 1 over temperature.

01:49:26.120 --> 01:49:29.200
Then you don't see the
effect of the temperature,

01:49:29.200 --> 01:49:33.060
and [INAUDIBLE] will be
just like small corrections

01:49:33.060 --> 01:49:35.880
to the vacuum [? we got. ?]

01:49:35.880 --> 01:49:37.480
But now when L
become of [? all ?]

01:49:37.480 --> 01:49:40.600
the 1 over the
temperature, then you

01:49:40.600 --> 01:49:43.270
find something
interesting happens.

01:49:43.270 --> 01:49:49.810
Then the L, then
this [? worksheet ?]

01:49:49.810 --> 01:49:52.690
will roughly go to the horizon.

01:49:52.690 --> 01:49:54.200
Then what we will
find in the end

01:49:54.200 --> 01:49:58.240
when the L become say
larger than some value say

01:49:58.240 --> 01:50:06.120
of all the 1 over t, the
only solution you can find

01:50:06.120 --> 01:50:08.820
is that this string just
two string heading down.

01:50:08.820 --> 01:50:10.830
That's the only solution.

01:50:10.830 --> 01:50:14.440
And then that means that the
quark, anti-quark no longer

01:50:14.440 --> 01:50:17.540
interact with each other.

01:50:17.540 --> 01:50:20.180
And then they are screened.

01:50:20.180 --> 01:50:21.570
Then they are screened.

01:50:21.570 --> 01:50:23.890
So a short distance is
the same as in the vacuum.

01:50:23.890 --> 01:50:26.375
But when you go to
long distance, of all

01:50:26.375 --> 01:50:28.740
the 1 over temperature, and
then eventually it would get

01:50:28.740 --> 01:50:29.910
screened.

01:50:29.910 --> 01:50:38.240
So this is another
cute calculus problem

01:50:38.240 --> 01:50:39.490
which I'm sure you will enjoy.

01:50:43.080 --> 01:50:45.720
Yeah.

01:50:45.720 --> 01:50:47.570
That's all for today.
