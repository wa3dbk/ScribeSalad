00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.550
HONG LIU: OK, let us start.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.510
So first, let me
remind you what we did

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.330
at the end of the last lecture.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:38.480
So we can see there's a
large N matrix field theory.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:48.020
And then we saw that when
you write down your Feynman

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.040
diagrams to calculate
things, then

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.850
there's a difference now between
the order of contractions.

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.970
Which is now
refracted whether you

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.950
have a Planar diagram or
non-planar diagram, et cetera.

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:07.190
And that in turn, also
affects your end counting.

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:13.920
So at the end, we
discussed two observations.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.770
One observation we said, is for
the example to be considered is

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.840
the non-planar diagram, even
though it cannot be drawn

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.060
on the plane without
crossing lines,

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.560
can actually be drawn on the
torus without crossing lines.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.900
So the diagram can actually be
straightened out on the torus.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:44.200
And another observation,
is that the power of N

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:50.490
is related to the number of
faces you have in your diagram

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.960
after you have
straightened it out.

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:02.535
So now, I'm going to generalize
these two observations.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.605
So first, I will
tell you a fact.

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.847
Many of you may
already know this.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:28.270
So I'll first tell you a
fact that any orientable two

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:58.986
dimensional surface is
classified topologically

00:02:58.986 --> 00:03:05.960
by integer, which I will call h.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.723
So this h is called a genus.

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:35.010
So heuristically, this genus
is equal to the number of holes

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.020
a surface has.

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:46.850
So for example, if
you have a plane,

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.860
the plane topologically
is actually

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.470
equivalent to a
sphere, so when I

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.380
draw a sphere,
that means a plane,

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.180
because if you
identify the point

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.770
on the plane of the infinity,
then it becomes a sphere.

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:04.590
So topologically, a plane is
no different from a sphere.

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.900
So this genus 0.

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:08.723
So this is plane.

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.330
So h is equal to 0.

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:26.920
And then for torus,
then there's one hole,

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:27.980
and this is just genus 1.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.560
So this is torus.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:40.995
You can also draw surfaces
with as many holes as you want.

00:04:40.995 --> 00:04:42.952
So this is surface
with two holes.

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:50.800
A surface with two holes,
and so this is genius 2.

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.050
So the remarkable thing
is that this actually

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:03.296
classifies the topology of
all two-dimensional surfaces.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:12.090
And this so-called
topological invariant,

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:18.930
there's a topological number
a so-called Euler number,

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:25.710
which is defined to be Chi
is equal to 2 minus 2h.

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:32.720
So if h labels the
topology, and so the Chi

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.010
is related to h in this way.

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:39.865
So any two surfaces
with the same topology

00:05:39.865 --> 00:05:43.330
will have the same Chi, because
if they have the same h,

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:44.520
they have the same Chi.

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.385
So Chi is what we call the
topological invariants.

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:54.790
So this is just a
mathematical fact.

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:58.700
So now I'm going
to make two claims.

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:02.430
So these two claims
are in some sense,

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:07.360
still evident after you
have studied a little bit.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.390
I'm not going to prove it
here, will just make the claim,

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:16.980
and then I will leave the
task to familiarize these two

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:20.490
claims to yourself.

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:24.150
But as I said, these two claims
are actually self-evident,

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:26.370
if you just do a
little bit of studying.

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:36.830
So claim one-- so
this is regarding

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:39.900
the structural Feynman diagrams.

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:48.350
So remember, the example
theory we conceded last time

00:06:48.350 --> 00:07:04.360
was something like this, which
phi is [INAUDIBLE] matrix.

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:10.690
So if you can look at
the Feynman diagrams

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:16.180
of the theories, the
claim is the following.

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:29.360
for any non-planar
diagram, there

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:49.430
exists integer h
so that the diagram

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:53.342
can be straightened out.

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:11.950
Straightened out just means
non-crossing on a genus h

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:33.080
surface, but not on a
surface with a smaller genus.

00:08:43.669 --> 00:08:52.190
So actually, you can classify
all the non-planar diagrams

00:08:52.190 --> 00:09:00.630
by drawing it on
a genus h surface

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:04.900
on two-dimensional surfaces
with non-trivial topology.

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:07.410
And then you should be able
to find the number h, which

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:13.000
is the lowest genus you
need to make this diagram

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.670
to be non-crossing,
instead of crossing.

00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:20.820
Last time, we saw an example
which you can stretch it out

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:24.160
on the torus, but it was
a more complicated diagram

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.230
and torus would not be enough.

00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:29.020
You would need, say, a genus
2 surface or higher genus

00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:29.520
surface.

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:38.290
So you can easily
convince yourself

00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:44.890
that this is doable
just by some practice.

00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:46.146
Also, this is very reasonable.

00:09:46.146 --> 00:09:48.104
Do you have any questions
regarding this claim?

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:52.830
Good.

00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:56.670
So this was claim one.

00:09:56.670 --> 00:10:04.450
The claim two-- and
this is a generalization

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:06.434
of the second observation.

00:10:06.434 --> 00:10:07.850
It's a claim of
the generalization

00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:10.300
of the first observation
of last time,

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:12.190
and claim two will
be the generalization

00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:13.273
of the second observation.

00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:43.040
For any diagram, the power
of n coming from contracting

00:10:43.040 --> 00:11:20.706
propagators is given
by the number of faces

00:11:20.706 --> 00:11:24.390
on such a genus h surface.

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:41.820
As we explained last
time, the number of faces

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:47.260
just means the number of
these connected regions

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:47.975
in the diagram.

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:53.830
But if you are
stretching it out,

00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:55.710
then there's an
ambiguous way you

00:11:55.710 --> 00:12:01.010
can count the number
of disconnected regions

00:12:01.010 --> 00:12:02.570
In the diagram.

00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:10.660
And that number is the power of
n coming from the contracting

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:12.180
propagators.

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:16.290
So this claim is
also self-evident

00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:20.790
because each power of n comes
from a single connected line.

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:22.840
And essentially, a
single connected line

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:26.830
will be circles some face and
so the number of independents

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:29.350
inside the face of course, are
just the number of power n.

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:35.695
Any questions regarding
the second claim?

00:12:41.367 --> 00:12:41.866
Good.

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:49.257
So based on these two claims,
now immediately write down

00:12:49.257 --> 00:12:49.965
the independents.

00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:58.550
So from this, we can
find a vacuum diagram.

00:12:58.550 --> 00:13:02.496
Again, we have been only talking
about the vacuum diagram.

00:13:02.496 --> 00:13:07.810
Vacuum diagram means the
diagram has no external lags,

00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:09.570
has the full independence.

00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:13.140
So from here, we
immediately conclude

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:25.965
that the vacuum diagram has
the following, g squared

00:13:25.965 --> 00:13:26.590
and dependence.

00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:34.810
So g squared is just
the carpeting constant.

00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:39.990
So remember, each propagator
is proportional to g squared

00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:47.233
and that each vertex
is one over g squared.

00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:53.210
Just from there.

00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:55.940
So let's just take an
arbitrary vacuum diagram.

00:13:55.940 --> 00:14:02.470
Let me call this amplitude
to be A. And A should

00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:05.760
be proportional to g
squared to the power

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:21.620
E. E should be the
number of propagators,

00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:24.450
because each propagator gives
you a factor of g squared.

00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:33.630
And also minus V.
And V is the number

00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:38.130
of vertices below to
the number of vertices.

00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:40.970
And each vertex gives
you one over g squared,

00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:45.890
so that should
give you E minus V.

00:14:45.890 --> 00:14:50.530
And then we just multiply
N to the power of F,

00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:52.010
and F is the number of faces.

00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:07.690
So without doing
any calculation,

00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:15.222
so this has essentially
characterized the N and the g

00:15:15.222 --> 00:15:17.222
and the accompanying
dependents of any diagrams.

00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:25.470
Now, if you look
at this expression,

00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:31.550
you say we are doomed, because
this kind of expression

00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:36.730
does not have a
sensible [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:41.460
So remember our goal, the
original goal of the 't Hooft

00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:44.690
is that you treat
this N as a parameter

00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:48.990
and then you want to
take it N to be large

00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:54.160
and then to it's ranking, one
over N. Doing expansion in one

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:59.170
over N means you are expanding
around the including infinity.

00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:03.480
You want to expand around
the including infinity.

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:06.260
But if you look
at this expression

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:10.920
and then go to infinity, it's
not a well-defined limit,

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:15.850
because I can draw a [INAUDIBLE]
Feynman diagram, which

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:18.000
F can be as large as possible.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.720
So you just have
sufficiently many vertices,

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:28.290
and sufficient to be mainly
propogators, F is unbounded.

00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:33.130
So then, there's another
well-defined angle

00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:34.115
to infinity limits.

00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:45.340
So this expression is not a
sensible N of infinity limit.

00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:52.880
If you don't have a
sensible N infinity limit,

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:56.140
then you cannot talk about
doing a longer expansion,

00:16:56.140 --> 00:17:01.545
and you cannot even define
the limit we just finished.

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:06.224
Yes?

00:17:06.224 --> 00:17:10.705
AUDIENCE: I remember people
do partial sum to-- can

00:17:10.705 --> 00:17:12.490
they do the same thing here?

00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:16.900
Put the large in the
denominator pattern from series

00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:20.222
of singular bubbles and--

00:17:20.222 --> 00:17:21.210
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:17:21.210 --> 00:17:23.486
AUDIENCE: Like a random
face approximation--

00:17:23.486 --> 00:17:24.069
HONG LIU: Yes.

00:17:24.069 --> 00:17:27.109
AUDIENCE: Somehow they
can infinite a sum

00:17:27.109 --> 00:17:31.053
over an infinite number
of A, and put the margin

00:17:31.053 --> 00:17:36.360
into like 1 minus N something
for the denominator--

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:37.770
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:17:37.770 --> 00:17:41.450
So people certainly have
been talking about expansion.

00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:46.540
And certainly, if
this just failed here,

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:48.100
we will not be
talking about this.

00:17:54.102 --> 00:17:55.560
I'm just setting
up a target, which

00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:57.510
I'm going to shoot it down.

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:04.500
Right.

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:11.470
Yeah, I would just say if
you do the margin expansion,

00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:14.530
this probably would be the
place which would turn you back.

00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:18.844
You say, ah, there's
no margin limits,

00:18:18.844 --> 00:18:20.710
and that's from another problem.

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:27.590
But hopefully, that's
no ordinary person.

00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:31.900
And so remember, there are
several nice mathematical

00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:33.670
tricks you have to go through.

00:18:33.670 --> 00:18:36.180
First, you have to invent the
stop line notation so that you

00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:37.730
can count the end very easily.

00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:39.980
Yeah, first you have to come
up with this margin idea.

00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:42.800
I think maybe not due to
him, maybe other people

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:45.090
already considered similar
things like right here.

00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:47.610
But first you have to think
about the double line notation

00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:51.420
to make your computation easier,
and then even after you reach

00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:54.040
the staff and then you need
to know this kind of topology,

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:55.684
et cetera.

00:18:55.684 --> 00:18:57.350
After you reach this
staff, still, there

00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:59.740
is a roadblock here.

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:02.173
But 't Hooft found a very
simple way to go around it.

00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:12.850
Because when I say this
limit it is not well-defined,

00:19:12.850 --> 00:19:17.420
I made the assumption that
when I go to infinity limit,

00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:19.735
the g is kept fixed.

00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:31.470
So that's the reason
that this will blow up.

00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:37.070
But then 't Hooft came up
with a different image.

00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:40.026
He said when you can see
that N goes infinity,

00:19:40.026 --> 00:19:41.400
but at the same
time, you can see

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:42.720
that g squared goes to zero.

00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:49.800
At the same time, you can see
that g squared goes to zero.

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:52.930
Because the problem
with this, is

00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:57.450
that if you have a
diagram with lots of faces

00:19:57.450 --> 00:20:01.670
and if you multiply
by a finite number,

00:20:01.670 --> 00:20:06.590
if you take g equal to
0, then you have infinity

00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:08.650
multiply something
potentially goes to 0,

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:12.020
maybe you will get
something finite.

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:13.030
One second.

00:20:13.030 --> 00:20:16.220
So you said let's
consider this limit,

00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:20.520
so that the product of
them is kept finite.

00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:27.030
Let's consider this limit.

00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:31.140
So in this limit, the end
counting will be different.

00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:39.750
So this A will be g squared
N, E minus l, because we

00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:42.040
want to keep this fixed.

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:45.600
So we put an N factor here,
then we take the N factor out.

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:52.900
N plus F plus V
minus E. And then

00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:55.230
let me just write this
slightly differently.

00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:56.120
So this is Lambda.

00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:59.190
If I use this notation,
Lambda now is finite.

00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:03.490
So this is E minus
V. So let me just

00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:08.930
write it as Lambda L minus
1 N to the power of Chi.

00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:12.240
Now, let me explain [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:25.610
First, L is equal
to E minus V plus 1,

00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:27.660
is the number of
loops in the diagram.

00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:37.820
So do you guys remember this
formula, why this is true?

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:44.590
The reason this is true is
very easy to understand.

00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:49.810
So if you look at the Feynman
diagram, the number of loops

00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:51.790
is exactly the
same as the number

00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:53.010
of undetermined momentum.

00:21:55.730 --> 00:22:01.510
And each propagator will carry
momentum, and at each vertex,

00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:03.670
you have momentum conservation.

00:22:03.670 --> 00:22:05.630
But then this overall
momentum conservation,

00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:09.370
which is guaranteed, so the
number of independent momentum

00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:12.360
is E minus V and then plus 1.

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:18.260
Yeah, it's just E
minus V minus 1,

00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:21.970
because there's only V
minus 1 independent momentum

00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:22.960
constraints.

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:26.150
So this is the number of
independent momentums,

00:22:26.150 --> 00:22:29.280
and so this is the
number of loops.

00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:37.950
And the Chi is just defined
to be the number of faces

00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:41.300
plus the number of vertices
minus the number of edge.

00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:46.640
Yes?

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:48.810
AUDIENCE: Is there any--
in general, is there

00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:51.370
a relation between E, V, and
F, like are they completely

00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:52.740
independent to each other?

00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:53.700
HONG LIU: E, V, and F?

00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:56.110
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:22:56.110 --> 00:22:59.630
HONG LIU: Yeah, that
I'm going to explain.

00:22:59.630 --> 00:23:01.640
Any other questions?

00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:04.620
AUDIENCE: So the reason
that you can take the F

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:06.120
to infinity limits
without taking it

00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:10.700
to 0, is that why we can't
apply this to QCD to get a--

00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:13.800
HONG LIU: No, because
we apply this.

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:16.044
AUDIENCE: But if g is not small?

00:23:16.044 --> 00:23:17.210
HONG LIU: It doesn't matter.

00:23:22.550 --> 00:23:28.130
So this is an expansion scheme.

00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:31.340
And you can apply
it to QCD, then

00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:33.940
you can ask whether this
particular expansion scheme is

00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:35.970
a good approximation or not.

00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:37.380
That's a separate question.

00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:39.960
And the focus is pretty
good, it's not that bad.

00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:45.840
Yeah, focus of each
squaring is finite.

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:47.205
AUDIENCE: But it's [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:47.205 --> 00:23:48.830
HONG LIU: No, here
it does not tell you

00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:51.500
if lambda has to be small.

00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:54.200
Lambda can be very big here.

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:58.000
It just tells you the lambda
in this limit has to be finite.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.700
Lambda can be convening
and it can be very big.

00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:03.700
And actually, in the
future, we will take lambda

00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:04.450
to go to infinity.

00:24:12.030 --> 00:24:17.030
So now, in order to have
a well-defined limit

00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:20.210
still depends on this chi.

00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:29.040
So now, you ask why this works
because we still have this chi,

00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:31.358
but now again, we need
another piece of mathematics.

00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:43.300
First, when you
draw, let me remind

00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:51.590
you some diagram
we had last time,

00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:53.994
so this is the simplest diagram.

00:24:53.994 --> 00:24:55.660
And there's a lot of
non-planar diagrams

00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:59.610
which you can draw
on the torus, which

00:24:59.610 --> 00:25:02.710
is the non-planar version
of this, et cetera.

00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:05.224
And you can also have
more complicated diagrams.

00:25:05.224 --> 00:25:06.640
So suppose you are
on the torus, I

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:10.250
can consider more complicated
diagrams, like that.

00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:11.845
For example, such diagrams.

00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:22.440
So if you think about such
diagrams, then in a sense,

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:34.530
each Feynman diagram
can be considered

00:25:34.530 --> 00:25:45.220
as a partition of the surface.

00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:55.640
So if you draw a diagram of
the surface into polygons.

00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:04.370
Yeah, it's very clear here.

00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:08.660
I drew this now with wavy
lines, just make them straight.

00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:13.270
And this one topologically,
I can just draw like this,

00:26:13.270 --> 00:26:21.270
and then I have one, one, and
the other part, similarly here.

00:26:21.270 --> 00:26:23.600
So each Feynman diagram
can be concealed

00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:28.750
if you just partition whatever
surface you draw the diagram.

00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:30.280
Is this clear to you?

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:32.570
So this is a very
important point.

00:26:32.570 --> 00:26:33.970
Yes?

00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:35.220
AUDIENCE: Can you repeat that?

00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:37.010
HONG LIU: Yes.

00:26:37.010 --> 00:26:38.500
Look at this diagram.

00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:41.890
So this is a Feynman
diagram drawn on the torus.

00:26:41.890 --> 00:26:46.460
Does this look like a partition
of torus into polygons?

00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:48.870
Yes, so that's what
I'm talking about.

00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:51.260
And the statement that this
would apply for any Feynman

00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:52.750
diagrams.

00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:56.250
Yes, so this is like a
partition of a sphere.

00:26:56.250 --> 00:26:59.520
You separate a sphere into
three regions, one, two, three.

00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:08.260
Any questions about this thing?

00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:10.780
Yes, do you have a question?

00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:13.798
AUDIENCE: Yeah, in that case
the third one isn't abandoned,

00:27:13.798 --> 00:27:15.280
is it?

00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:15.820
The third--

00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:16.720
HONG LIU: So this one
I am going to show you,

00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:18.670
you should view the
plane as a sphere.

00:27:18.670 --> 00:27:20.780
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:23.960
HONG LIU: Topologically,
it's the same as a sphere.

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:30.460
So now, once you
recognize this, now you

00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:37.200
can use a famous
theorem due to Euler.

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:42.110
Some of you could have learned
it in junior in high school,

00:27:42.110 --> 00:28:00.490
because the-- so this theorem,
given a surface composed

00:28:00.490 --> 00:28:08.770
of polygons-- so if you're
not familiar with this,

00:28:08.770 --> 00:28:22.420
you can go to Wikipedia-- with F
faces, E edges, and V vertices.

00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:36.690
Suppose you have a surface
like this, and then

00:28:36.690 --> 00:28:39.730
this particular
combination chi, which

00:28:39.730 --> 00:28:44.580
is defined to be F plus V
minus E is precisely equal

00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:47.820
to 2 minus h.

00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:53.330
So this is the-- this is why
this is called Euler's number.

00:28:53.330 --> 00:28:56.840
And they only depend
on the topology.

00:28:56.840 --> 00:29:00.500
So this combination only depends
on the topology of the surface

00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:01.355
and nothing else.

00:29:04.890 --> 00:29:08.450
So we can imagine 't Hooft a
very good high school student.

00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:11.250
So he already knew this.

00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:15.320
So now, we can
rewrite this thing

00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:23.540
as A, reading script A lambda
to the power L minus 1 N

00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:24.890
to the power 2 minus 2h.

00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:29.680
So remember h is
greater than zero.

00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:35.110
So now this expression
has a well-defined limit.

00:29:38.939 --> 00:29:40.980
So now this has a well-defined
analogy and limit.

00:29:44.010 --> 00:29:48.240
So to the leading order,
and in particular,

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:52.206
this N dependence only depends
on the topology of the diagram.

00:29:52.206 --> 00:29:53.997
Only depend on the
topology of the diagram.

00:29:58.970 --> 00:30:18.190
For example, to leading
order in large N,

00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:20.926
then the leading order will be
given by the planar diagrams.

00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:27.620
Because that should
be the diagrams with h

00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:30.440
equal zero because
h is not negative.

00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:33.920
So the leading term
is given by h zero.

00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:39.190
So all of the planar
diagrams in this limit,

00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:45.190
in this so-called
't Hooft limit,

00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:47.326
will have N dependence
which is in N squared.

00:30:50.570 --> 00:30:51.890
N squared.

00:30:51.890 --> 00:30:54.700
So now if you go
back to your loads,

00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:57.800
above the fourth diagram
we started last time,

00:30:57.800 --> 00:31:00.510
above the two planar diagrams
we started last time,

00:31:00.510 --> 00:31:02.415
you can immediately
tell that indeed it

00:31:02.415 --> 00:31:04.010
is N squared in this limit.

00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:14.220
Then you still haven't
explained in terms of lambda.

00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:16.830
So you can do Feynman
diagrams, et cetera.

00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:19.560
Say lambda just depends
on the number of loops.

00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:23.580
So if you have one
loop, then start it

00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:27.940
with a lambda equal to zero,
start it with some constant.

00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:33.680
If it's two loops, then lambda,
three loops, lambda squared,

00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:34.180
et cetera.

00:31:37.650 --> 00:31:41.847
So the sum of four--
sum of all planar

00:31:41.847 --> 00:31:43.222
diagrams, we have
this structure.

00:31:46.410 --> 00:31:49.280
So you can imagine
you can sum all this,

00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:50.990
if you're powerful enough.

00:31:50.990 --> 00:31:53.030
And then you can write
it as N squared, then

00:31:53.030 --> 00:31:56.580
some function of lambda.

00:31:56.580 --> 00:32:00.620
So the planar diagram would
be just N squared time

00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:02.390
some function of lambda.

00:32:02.390 --> 00:32:08.870
So if you are powerful enough to
compute this f0 lambda exactly,

00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:12.080
then you can say you
have solved the planar.

00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:15.610
You have solved the large
N limit of this series.

00:32:15.610 --> 00:32:18.460
Unfortunately for lambda being
in gauge theory we cannot do

00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:19.134
that.

00:32:19.134 --> 00:32:20.550
We don't know how
to compute this.

00:32:20.550 --> 00:32:22.970
We can on only compute
perturbatively which

00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:26.600
actually does not work for QCD.

00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:27.980
Yes?

00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:30.450
AUDIENCE: But N
going to be infinite.

00:32:30.450 --> 00:32:34.140
It just seems like-- why does
this overcome the same problem

00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:35.610
that we had before?

00:32:35.610 --> 00:32:37.940
HONG LIU: Because this
is a specific power.

00:32:37.940 --> 00:32:39.430
Here there's no specific power.

00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:45.469
That F can be as
large as you want.

00:32:45.469 --> 00:32:47.260
AUDIENCE: But wasn't
the other problem also

00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:48.990
that N was going to infinity?

00:32:48.990 --> 00:32:50.550
HONG LIU: No that's
another problem.

00:32:50.550 --> 00:32:53.400
Because here, there is a
specification limit, when

00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:55.490
you take N going to infinity.

00:32:55.490 --> 00:32:57.270
In there, there's
no specific limit.

00:32:57.270 --> 00:33:00.340
There's no limit when you
take N go to infinity.

00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:03.350
No, the limit is N squared.

00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:08.750
I can say-- this is
your essentially,

00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:12.410
your vacuum energy, right?

00:33:12.410 --> 00:33:15.709
I can say E0,
divided by N squared

00:33:15.709 --> 00:33:16.750
has a well defined limit.

00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:24.850
So the key is that this is
a specific dependence on N.

00:33:24.850 --> 00:33:26.544
But there it's unbounded.

00:33:26.544 --> 00:33:27.960
AUDIENCE: I guess
another question

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:31.067
is, we didn't assume that
lambda is a small prohibiter.

00:33:31.067 --> 00:33:32.650
HONG LIU: No we did
not assume lambda.

00:33:32.650 --> 00:33:35.060
AUDIENCE: So isn't this kind
of perturbative analysis,

00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:38.340
saying that that series
converges to some function,

00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:41.148
is that OK?

00:33:41.148 --> 00:33:46.350
HONG LIU: It's a very good
question, and it is OK.

00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:49.080
But the reasoning
is more complicated.

00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:51.285
The reasoning is
more complicated.

00:33:51.285 --> 00:33:52.160
The keys are falling.

00:33:55.730 --> 00:33:59.870
What I'm writing here
you can understand

00:33:59.870 --> 00:34:01.400
using two perspectives.

00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:03.220
Just one is heuristic.

00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:07.020
Just one say, suppose you can
only do perturbation series,

00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:09.510
and that would be the
thing you compute.

00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:11.710
And then say, if you
are powerful enough

00:34:11.710 --> 00:34:13.620
to solve the theory
with perturbity,

00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:16.409
then you're guaranteed just to
find some general functions.

00:34:16.409 --> 00:34:18.969
Yeah but whether
this series actually

00:34:18.969 --> 00:34:22.989
converges is an important
mathematical question,

00:34:22.989 --> 00:34:24.760
of course, one has to answer.

00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:27.190
It turns out, actually
this is convergent.

00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:29.730
You can mathematically
prove this is convergent,

00:34:29.730 --> 00:34:30.789
for very simple reasons.

00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:37.780
Yeah this is a side remark,
but let me mention it

00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:41.110
because this is a cool fact.

00:34:41.110 --> 00:34:47.050
So if you do just
lambda of g 5, 4 series,

00:34:47.050 --> 00:34:50.770
just do the standard
Feynman diagram

00:34:50.770 --> 00:34:53.409
calculation, input
the basic series,

00:34:53.409 --> 00:34:56.489
the series is divergent.

00:34:56.489 --> 00:34:59.950
The series is
divergent, no matter how

00:34:59.950 --> 00:35:03.790
g is small, just as the
radius of convergence

00:35:03.790 --> 00:35:07.200
is 0 for any non-zero value.

00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:10.520
Yeah the radius of convergence
is 0 in terms of g,

00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:12.370
no matter how small g is.

00:35:12.370 --> 00:35:14.440
The reason that
it's divergent is

00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:16.940
because the number of diagrams.

00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:22.210
So when you go to Nth order, it
increases exponentially in N.

00:35:22.210 --> 00:35:25.370
So the coefficient of
g-- say to the power

00:35:25.370 --> 00:35:27.756
N-- the coefficient
can become huge.

00:35:27.756 --> 00:35:29.130
Because of the
number of diagrams

00:35:29.130 --> 00:35:31.680
to increase exponentially
in N. So you think,

00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:35.630
I have g to the power N times N
factorial, something like that.

00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:39.690
And that series
is not convergent.

00:35:39.690 --> 00:35:42.640
But the thing that
is convergent here,

00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:46.300
because can see the planar
diagram, the number of planar

00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:48.620
diagram is very, very small.

00:35:48.620 --> 00:35:52.720
It only increases with
N as a power of N,

00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:55.990
rather than as a
factorial of N. And so you

00:35:55.990 --> 00:35:59.000
can make lambda small enough,
then this can be convergent.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:35:59.500
Yeah.

00:36:01.973 --> 00:36:04.556
AUDIENCE: Didn't we already see
at the end of the last lecture

00:36:04.556 --> 00:36:07.770
that only planar diagrams keep
the biggest contribution, so

00:36:07.770 --> 00:36:10.770
why is that equal to--

00:36:10.770 --> 00:36:12.220
HONG LIU: Sorry?

00:36:12.220 --> 00:36:14.790
AUDIENCE: So at the end of the
last lecture, we saw that--

00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:15.998
HONG LIU: No not necessarily.

00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:20.330
That is only for
the two diagrams.

00:36:20.330 --> 00:36:23.680
If you look at this thing, I
can draw arbitrary complicated

00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:27.400
non-planar diagrams, with
a very large F. They only

00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:30.820
depend on F. It does not
depend on anything else,

00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:31.616
if you do this.

00:36:41.570 --> 00:36:47.130
OK so in general,
then of course if you

00:36:47.130 --> 00:36:50.720
include the higher non-planar
diagram, et cetera--

00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:56.820
so in general the vacuum
energy, which you would normally

00:36:56.820 --> 00:36:58.260
call log z.

00:36:58.260 --> 00:37:03.260
OK log z is, essentially, the
sum of all vacuum diagrams.

00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:11.390
So this is the
partition functions,

00:37:11.390 --> 00:37:13.050
so it's a path integral.

00:37:13.050 --> 00:37:16.555
So log z, then we'll
have the expansion from h

00:37:16.555 --> 00:37:21.560
equal to 0 to infinity,
N two the power 2

00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:26.230
minus 2h, F h lambda.

00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:31.980
OK so at each genus
level, you will

00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:33.330
have some function of lambda.

00:37:40.620 --> 00:37:47.300
Yeah the leading, order
we just showed is f0.

00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:49.760
And then if you add
the Taurus now--

00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:52.490
we'll add to the torus now
our on non-planar diagram.

00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:54.680
It's order one.

00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:56.780
And then, for the
two genus, it's

00:37:56.780 --> 00:38:00.650
f over n squared, et cetera.

00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:12.900
So let me just write
down z explicitly.

00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:22.430
Z is the partition
function, i S phi.

00:38:22.430 --> 00:38:27.060
So if you compute this, with
the right boundary condition--

00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:29.000
if you compute
this path integral,

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:30.730
with the proper
boundary conditions,

00:38:30.730 --> 00:38:35.290
then that gives you
the vacuum diagrams.

00:38:35.290 --> 00:38:38.310
The log z is the sum of all
connected vacuum diagrams.

00:38:38.310 --> 00:38:43.510
I should say, the sum of all
connected vacuum diagrams.

00:39:02.530 --> 00:39:03.785
Any questions regarding this?

00:39:12.050 --> 00:39:13.280
Good.

00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:24.927
Now there is a heuristic way we
can understand this expansion.

00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:38.260
So it's actually a
heuristic way to understand

00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:41.150
this one-way expansion.

00:39:41.150 --> 00:39:46.690
So let's just look at
this path integral.

00:39:46.690 --> 00:39:49.270
So let's look at the Lagrangian.

00:39:49.270 --> 00:39:52.070
So the Lagrangian I wrote there.

00:39:52.070 --> 00:39:53.830
In this 't Hooft
limit, I can write it

00:39:53.830 --> 00:39:57.460
as minus N divided by lambda.

00:39:57.460 --> 00:40:00.280
So I want to write things
in terms of lambda.

00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:04.630
So I multiply the pre-factor N
downstairs, and then upstairs.

00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:06.240
So g squared N give me lambda.

00:40:09.750 --> 00:40:13.920
And then I have a
trace, et cetera.

00:40:19.490 --> 00:40:24.170
So now it's easy to see
that you're leading order,

00:40:24.170 --> 00:40:27.170
this things should give
you order N squared.

00:40:27.170 --> 00:40:30.880
Because there is already a
factor of N here, and the trace

00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:33.960
is the sum of N things.

00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:37.290
So generically, this should
be of the order N squared.

00:40:43.070 --> 00:40:47.200
So now we-- a little
bit leap of faith--

00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:53.880
say supposing the large N
limit, since the leading order

00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:56.540
is order N squared, you can
argue that actually all the N

00:40:56.540 --> 00:40:58.250
squared is the
expansion parameter,

00:40:58.250 --> 00:41:00.240
if you do scatter
point approximation.

00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:03.750
And then naturally, you
will see the power will

00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:05.760
be given by 1 over N squared.

00:41:18.070 --> 00:41:20.100
any questions regarding this?

00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:21.322
Yes?

00:41:21.322 --> 00:41:24.770
AUDIENCE: What does N
over lambda factor to?

00:41:24.770 --> 00:41:26.459
HONG LIU: It's--

00:41:26.459 --> 00:41:27.000
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:41:33.530 --> 00:41:35.060
HONG LIU: So clearly
this discussion

00:41:35.060 --> 00:41:39.580
actually does not-- so
when I say clearly here,

00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:42.670
it requires a little
bit of practice.

00:41:42.670 --> 00:41:48.660
But clearly, our
discussion only depend

00:41:48.660 --> 00:41:53.173
on the matrix nature of the
Lagrangian and the fields.

00:41:55.810 --> 00:41:58.610
So I'm going to make a claim.

00:41:58.610 --> 00:42:19.520
It says for any Lagrangian,
of matrix valued fields

00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:29.790
of the form L, which is N
divided by some coupling

00:42:29.790 --> 00:42:32.967
constant, times a
trace of something.

00:42:32.967 --> 00:42:34.800
Doesn't matter what you
put inside the trace

00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:37.720
here, as far as you
have a single trace.

00:42:40.350 --> 00:42:45.983
Such a series will always
have the expansion like this.

00:43:00.450 --> 00:43:06.040
It will always have an
expansion like this.

00:43:21.297 --> 00:43:22.338
So let me just summarize.

00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:57.460
In the 't Hooft limit--
by 't Hooft limit,

00:43:57.460 --> 00:44:05.770
I always mean this form-- the
coupling constant is defined

00:44:05.770 --> 00:44:10.830
such that you have some
coupling concept here,

00:44:10.830 --> 00:44:13.220
and then you have over N factor.

00:44:13.220 --> 00:44:16.660
And then of course, you can
also have some coupling constant

00:44:16.660 --> 00:44:17.160
inside here.

00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:18.410
It doesn't matter.

00:44:18.410 --> 00:44:21.100
As far as those coupling
constants are independent of N.

00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:26.040
And as far as things inside
the trace are independent of N.

00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:36.050
So for such a kind of series,
the 1 over N expansion

00:44:36.050 --> 00:44:43.100
is equal to the
topological expansion.

00:44:49.050 --> 00:45:06.905
It's the expansion in terms of
topology of Feynman diagrams.

00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:23.090
So this is a very,
very beautiful--

00:45:23.090 --> 00:45:30.420
and as I said, it's [INAUDIBLE],
because in principle, it

00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:36.429
puts a very simple structure
into something that's,

00:45:36.429 --> 00:45:37.720
in principle, very complicated.

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:44.520
Yeah, any questions
regarding this?

00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:45.290
Yes?

00:45:45.290 --> 00:45:48.090
AUDIENCE: Maybe it's not
can I just understand it

00:45:48.090 --> 00:45:50.270
in such a way that he
kind of treats the Feynman

00:45:50.270 --> 00:45:56.730
diagram as a triangulation
of different spaces.

00:45:56.730 --> 00:45:59.300
HONG LIU: Yeah for example, you
can think of from that point.

00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:02.660
Yeah, so we use that to
derive, to use this formula.

00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:14.020
Yeah and that picture will be
very useful in a little bit

00:46:14.020 --> 00:46:15.460
from now on.

00:46:15.460 --> 00:46:16.880
Keep that picture in mind.

00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:23.690
The Feynman diagram is like
the partition of some surfaces.

00:46:23.690 --> 00:46:25.570
And that will be
very useful later.

00:46:25.570 --> 00:46:27.530
AUDIENCE: Does there
ever arise a situation

00:46:27.530 --> 00:46:29.830
in which you care not
about two surfaces,

00:46:29.830 --> 00:46:32.740
but Feynman diagrams on
three surfaces or something

00:46:32.740 --> 00:46:33.750
like that?

00:46:33.750 --> 00:46:35.904
Because this asks
the question, you

00:46:35.904 --> 00:46:37.320
don't necessarily
have to consider

00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:38.870
the topology of two surfaces.

00:46:38.870 --> 00:46:41.290
Are there any situations in
which it's more complicated?

00:46:41.290 --> 00:46:43.373
HONG LIU: Yeah but we
always draw Feynman diagrams

00:46:43.373 --> 00:46:47.260
on the paper, which
is two dimensional.

00:46:47.260 --> 00:46:48.200
Yeah it's enough.

00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:49.560
Two dimensions is enough.

00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:51.694
You don't need to go
to three dimensions.

00:46:51.694 --> 00:46:53.110
Yeah and this
structure only comes

00:46:53.110 --> 00:46:54.610
when you go to two
dimensions, because if you

00:46:54.610 --> 00:46:56.735
go to three dimension, of
course, they don't cross.

00:46:58.619 --> 00:47:00.160
In three dimension,
you can no longer

00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:03.489
distinguish planar or
non-planar diagram.

00:47:03.489 --> 00:47:04.780
AUDIENCE: Well if you did-- OK.

00:47:10.224 --> 00:47:11.682
HONG LIU: Good any
other questions?

00:47:14.300 --> 00:47:16.300
AUDIENCE: Why is it always
orientable surfaces?

00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:25.340
HONG LIU: That's
a good question.

00:47:25.340 --> 00:47:31.480
It's because those lines
are orientable because when

00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:34.590
we draw the double
roation, so you

00:47:34.590 --> 00:47:36.140
have this two, double rotation.

00:47:36.140 --> 00:47:38.390
So essentially those
lines are orientable.

00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:39.810
They have a direction.

00:47:39.810 --> 00:47:42.450
And essentially, this is,
of course, one and two.

00:47:42.450 --> 00:47:45.960
Yeah so those Feynman diagrams
actually have a direction,

00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:48.670
have a sense of orientation.

00:47:48.670 --> 00:47:50.750
So I'm going to mention,
by passing in nature,

00:47:50.750 --> 00:47:52.570
but let me just
mention also now.

00:47:52.570 --> 00:47:57.890
So if it's not
[INAUDIBLE] matrix,

00:47:57.890 --> 00:48:01.500
say if it's a real symmetric
matrix, then the then

00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:03.530
there's no difference
between two index.

00:48:03.530 --> 00:48:05.270
And then there's no orientation.

00:48:05.270 --> 00:48:08.690
And that would be related
to m orientable surfaces.

00:48:08.690 --> 00:48:11.115
And then you need to
slightly generalize this.

00:48:16.070 --> 00:48:18.662
Any other questions?

00:48:18.662 --> 00:48:20.120
AUDIENCE: Now you
mentioned that it

00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:22.325
has something to do
with string theory,

00:48:22.325 --> 00:48:25.607
but does that it has anything
to do with scatter particles--

00:48:25.607 --> 00:48:27.690
HONG LIU: Yeah, so we're
going to talk about that.

00:48:30.122 --> 00:48:31.580
No, we're going to
talk about that.

00:48:35.590 --> 00:48:36.090
Good?

00:48:36.090 --> 00:48:37.965
So now let me talk about
general observables.

00:48:41.182 --> 00:48:42.890
I think we're a little
bit short on time,

00:48:42.890 --> 00:48:44.650
if we want to reach
the punchline today.

00:48:48.210 --> 00:48:54.260
So right now we only have
looked at the vacuum diagrams.

00:48:56.900 --> 00:49:01.972
So now let's look at
the general observables.

00:49:01.972 --> 00:49:03.680
Before talking about
general observables,

00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:06.640
let me just again
make a side remark,

00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:09.800
Which is the gauge
versus global symmetries.

00:49:17.047 --> 00:49:18.630
So in the example
we talk about here--

00:49:18.630 --> 00:49:22.780
let me call this a, equation a.

00:49:22.780 --> 00:49:24.450
Then let me write
down another equation

00:49:24.450 --> 00:49:27.078
b, which is a Yang-Mills theory.

00:49:42.260 --> 00:49:51.240
So the difference between
a and b-- so a is this guy.

00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:53.630
So the difference
between a and b,

00:49:53.630 --> 00:49:55.340
is that a, as we
discussed last time,

00:49:55.340 --> 00:49:57.200
is invariant on the
global symmetry,

00:49:57.200 --> 00:49:58.967
is a U(N) global symmetry.

00:50:06.650 --> 00:50:16.810
It's that phi is invariant under
the acting of a unitary matrix.

00:50:16.810 --> 00:50:18.195
But this U must be constant.

00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:25.480
Only for a constant
U is this a symmetry.

00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:28.754
But if you have studied a
little bit of gauge theory,

00:50:28.754 --> 00:50:30.420
or if you have not
studied gauge theory,

00:50:30.420 --> 00:50:45.320
just take my word
for it, the b is

00:50:45.320 --> 00:50:53.852
invariant under a local
symmetry, a local U(N)

00:50:53.852 --> 00:50:54.351
symmetry.

00:50:57.060 --> 00:51:00.460
He said A miu-- so
A mu is what make up

00:51:00.460 --> 00:51:12.370
the F-- U x A mu x, U dagger
x minus i partial mu U x.

00:51:12.370 --> 00:51:14.820
It doesn't matter.

00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:21.755
The only thing I want to say
is that this U x is arbitrary.

00:51:21.755 --> 00:51:27.230
It can have arbitrary
space time dependence.

00:51:42.820 --> 00:51:46.040
Just like of the
generalization of the QED,

00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:49.340
it's the gauge symmetry.

00:51:49.340 --> 00:51:51.050
So the key difference
between the two.

00:51:55.900 --> 00:51:59.170
the key difference between this
local and the global symmetry,

00:51:59.170 --> 00:52:05.360
are manifested in what kind of
observables we can see there.

00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:07.280
For example, for a--

00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:10.180
AUDIENCE: I think that should
be U dagger, partial mu and then

00:52:10.180 --> 00:52:11.122
U dagger.

00:52:16.110 --> 00:52:18.210
HONG LIU: HONG LIU:
So this difference,

00:52:18.210 --> 00:52:19.610
you can say what's the big deal?

00:52:19.610 --> 00:52:22.100
in one case, this is
constant, and this

00:52:22.100 --> 00:52:24.130
is dependent on space time.

00:52:24.130 --> 00:52:27.100
So the key difference
between them

00:52:27.100 --> 00:52:38.480
is that in the case for a,
operator like this phi squared,

00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:39.330
phi is a matrix.

00:52:39.330 --> 00:52:41.600
So phi squared is a matrix.

00:52:41.600 --> 00:52:44.530
Phi squared x is an
allowed operator.

00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:56.590
So this operator is
not invariant under

00:52:56.590 --> 00:52:59.420
this global U(N) symmetry.

00:52:59.420 --> 00:53:01.930
But it doesn't matter because
this is a global symmetry.

00:53:01.930 --> 00:53:03.450
So this is an allowed operator.

00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:11.181
But if you have gauge
symmetry, all operators

00:53:11.181 --> 00:53:12.180
must be gauge invariant.

00:53:21.898 --> 00:53:24.530
That means that
all operator must

00:53:24.530 --> 00:53:27.310
be invariant under this
kind of transformations.

00:53:27.310 --> 00:53:32.854
So the analog of this
is not allows operators.

00:53:35.740 --> 00:53:38.600
So observables in the gauge
theory are much more limited.

00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:49.220
So we will be interested
gauge theories.

00:53:49.220 --> 00:53:51.440
We will be interested
in gauge theories.

00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:55.812
So that means we are always
interested in observables,

00:53:55.812 --> 00:53:57.436
which are invariant
under the symmetry.

00:54:21.737 --> 00:54:23.320
So we're interested
in gauge theories.

00:54:36.170 --> 00:54:38.830
So that means we're always
interested in gauge invariant

00:54:38.830 --> 00:54:41.720
operators.

00:54:41.720 --> 00:54:44.820
So the kind of Lagrangian
does not matter.

00:54:44.820 --> 00:54:46.732
So you can have
the gauge fields.

00:54:46.732 --> 00:54:48.190
You can also have
some other field,

00:54:48.190 --> 00:54:51.600
say some matrix phi, et cetera.

00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:55.720
As phi is the Lagrangian
of this form, it's OK.

00:54:55.720 --> 00:54:59.100
We always only consider the
Lagrangian of that form.

00:54:59.100 --> 00:55:02.280
But it doesn't have an
arbitrary number of fields,

00:55:02.280 --> 00:55:04.330
and with arbitrary
kind of interactions.

00:55:14.260 --> 00:55:15.305
So you start your theory.

00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:22.247
So let's for simplicity, this
can see the local operators.

00:55:25.010 --> 00:55:34.750
In this kind of theory, then
allowed, say local operators,

00:55:34.750 --> 00:55:37.820
must always have some
kind of trace in it.

00:55:37.820 --> 00:55:44.390
Say you must have some
form trace, F mu U, F mu U,

00:55:44.390 --> 00:55:50.790
a trace phi squared, et cetera.

00:55:50.790 --> 00:55:57.370
A trace phi to some power F N,
phi to some power k, et cetera.

00:56:01.790 --> 00:56:04.650
You can also have operators
with more than one

00:56:04.650 --> 00:56:18.090
trace, say trace phi squared,
trace F mu U, F mu U.

00:56:18.090 --> 00:56:22.430
So we are going to
make a distinction

00:56:22.430 --> 00:56:25.380
because the operator
with only a single trace,

00:56:25.380 --> 00:56:26.892
we call them single
trace operator.

00:56:31.210 --> 00:56:33.810
And the operator with
more than one trace,

00:56:33.810 --> 00:56:35.512
we call them multiple
trace operators.

00:56:42.260 --> 00:56:45.400
OK so the reason for this
distinction will be clear soon.

00:56:52.040 --> 00:56:57.884
So multiple trace operators--
it's self-evident again--

00:56:57.884 --> 00:56:59.550
that multiple trace
operators can always

00:56:59.550 --> 00:57:01.760
be written as products of
single trace operators.

00:57:04.834 --> 00:57:06.000
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:10.890
Is it a possible case to have a
local gauge invariant operator,

00:57:10.890 --> 00:57:12.846
the F mu U times F mu U?

00:57:12.846 --> 00:57:15.220
HONG LIU: Yeah I always can
see the local gauge invariant

00:57:15.220 --> 00:57:16.910
operators.

00:57:16.910 --> 00:57:20.500
We can see the gauge theories.

00:57:20.500 --> 00:57:24.309
AUDIENCE: So this combination,
F mu U times F mu U, it's only--

00:57:24.309 --> 00:57:25.850
HONG LIU: No this
is gauge invariant.

00:57:25.850 --> 00:57:29.944
AUDIENCE: Is that the only
gauge invariant component?

00:57:29.944 --> 00:57:30.610
HONG LIU: Sorry?

00:57:30.610 --> 00:57:33.120
AUDIENCE: Is this is
the only gauge invariant

00:57:33.120 --> 00:57:36.160
component that we can use
to construct the gauge

00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:38.087
invariant local operators?

00:57:38.087 --> 00:57:40.420
HONG LIU: Sorry, I don't quite
understand what you mean.

00:57:40.420 --> 00:57:44.311
No this is just one
specific operator.

00:57:44.311 --> 00:57:50.420
No, you can take F to the power
N, an arbitrary number of-- as

00:57:50.420 --> 00:57:53.820
far as they're inside the trace,
it's always gauge invariant.

00:57:53.820 --> 00:57:56.410
AUDIENCE: I see.

00:57:56.410 --> 00:57:59.380
HONG LIU: I'm just writing
down a particular example.

00:57:59.380 --> 00:58:02.220
So just for
notational simplicity,

00:58:02.220 --> 00:58:05.610
I will just write-- so
from now on I will just

00:58:05.610 --> 00:58:15.990
denote the single trace
operators collectively just

00:58:15.990 --> 00:58:19.540
as O with some script
n, which denotes

00:58:19.540 --> 00:58:22.080
the different operators.

00:58:22.080 --> 00:58:24.820
so n denotes
different operators.

00:58:24.820 --> 00:58:28.810
And then for the multiple trace
operator, then you have O1, O2.

00:58:28.810 --> 00:58:30.830
That would be a
double trace operator.

00:58:30.830 --> 00:58:34.730
And O1, O2, O3,
say times O3 would

00:58:34.730 --> 00:58:38.530
be a triple trace operator.

00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:46.400
n just labels
different operators.

00:58:46.400 --> 00:58:48.245
I'm just using
abstract notation.

00:58:53.500 --> 00:59:01.880
And the reason for this-- a
distinction will be clear soon.

00:59:01.880 --> 00:59:15.540
Then for such gauge theories,
the general observables,

00:59:15.540 --> 00:59:26.362
in the quantum field theory
is just correlation functions

00:59:26.362 --> 00:59:27.570
of gauge invariant operators.

00:59:40.591 --> 00:59:42.090
So by gauge invariant
operators, you

00:59:42.090 --> 00:59:44.465
can have local operators,
non-local operators, et cetera.

00:59:48.100 --> 00:59:52.580
So for simplicity, I will
restrict my discussion only

00:59:52.580 --> 00:59:54.010
on the local operators.

00:59:54.010 --> 00:59:56.400
But local operators
means that the fields

00:59:56.400 --> 00:59:57.812
evaluated at a single point.

01:00:05.100 --> 01:00:09.870
So the typical
correlation functions,

01:00:09.870 --> 01:00:12.660
then the typical observables
will have this form,

01:00:12.660 --> 01:00:15.070
will be just a product of
some correlation functions,

01:00:15.070 --> 01:00:19.000
a product of some operators,
and I say their correlation

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.260
functions.

01:00:20.260 --> 01:00:23.993
By c I mean the connected
correlation functions.

01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:32.330
So you can see
immediately, these multi

01:00:32.330 --> 01:00:34.440
trace operators are
just the product

01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:36.440
of a single trace operator.

01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:38.900
And the correlation function
of a multiple trace operator

01:00:38.900 --> 01:00:41.840
can be obtained from those
of a single trace one.

01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:44.230
You just identify
some of the acts.

01:00:44.230 --> 01:00:45.685
Then that will be enough.

01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:50.750
So we only need to talk about
the correlation function

01:00:50.750 --> 01:00:51.850
of single trace operators.

01:00:56.730 --> 01:00:59.950
So now the question-- let
me call this equation one.

01:00:59.950 --> 01:01:03.890
So now the question follows
what we discussed before,

01:01:03.890 --> 01:01:07.932
is how do we decide the
N dependence of the guy?

01:01:07.932 --> 01:01:09.640
Previously we determined
the N dependence

01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:13.496
of this vacuum diagrams
of this petition function.

01:01:13.496 --> 01:01:15.120
But now want should
be the N dependence

01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:16.494
of general
correlation functions?

01:01:23.090 --> 01:01:26.460
One way to do it, you just
start immediately calculating.

01:01:26.460 --> 01:01:29.590
And then you can find
some root, et cetera.

01:01:29.590 --> 01:01:32.680
But actually there's
a very simple trick.

01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:35.580
There's a very simple
trick to determine

01:01:35.580 --> 01:01:37.220
the N dependence of this.

01:01:37.220 --> 01:01:39.010
So now I will explain.

01:01:39.010 --> 01:01:41.460
Now I will tell you.

01:01:41.460 --> 01:01:42.970
So I will not give
you any examples

01:01:42.970 --> 01:01:46.820
because this trick is so nice,
and it just works very easy.

01:01:55.720 --> 01:02:06.270
And so the question, what
is N dependence of one?

01:02:06.270 --> 01:02:08.363
So this is the question
we want to address.

01:02:11.030 --> 01:02:14.110
so here is a very
simple, beautiful, trick.

01:02:14.110 --> 01:02:18.232
So let's consider the following
generating functional.

01:02:18.232 --> 01:02:19.690
So in quantum field
theory, when we

01:02:19.690 --> 01:02:21.590
talk about
correlation functions,

01:02:21.590 --> 01:02:24.040
it's always convenient to
talk about the generating

01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:24.540
functional.

01:02:32.340 --> 01:02:37.830
So whatever is your field,
you do the path integral

01:02:37.830 --> 01:02:41.140
of all fields.

01:02:41.140 --> 01:02:45.470
And then you look at the action.

01:02:45.470 --> 01:02:50.260
So you have your regional
action, which I call S0.

01:02:50.260 --> 01:02:54.322
And then that's add
those operators.

01:02:58.010 --> 01:03:06.285
Ji x, O i x.

01:03:19.670 --> 01:03:21.990
Yes so this is a standard story.

01:03:21.990 --> 01:03:24.910
When you take the
derivative over Ji,

01:03:24.910 --> 01:03:28.130
then you will bring
down a factor of O i.

01:03:28.130 --> 01:03:30.880
Then that essentially give
you the correlation function.

01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:33.280
You have, for example,
a correlation function,

01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:34.738
the connected
correlation function.

01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:41.680
O n, the connected
correlation function

01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:49.290
would be just you take
the derivative of log z.

01:03:49.290 --> 01:03:58.220
And then delta J1 x delta Jn xn.

01:03:58.220 --> 01:04:00.310
And then you set
J equal to zero.

01:04:00.310 --> 01:04:02.560
You set all the J equal to zero.

01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:06.660
And that gives you the
end point function.

01:04:06.660 --> 01:04:10.096
I should write i here,
so i to the power n.

01:04:17.540 --> 01:04:21.890
So now here is the
beautiful trick.

01:04:21.890 --> 01:04:26.062
You can determine this
in a single shot, the N

01:04:26.062 --> 01:04:27.295
dependence of this guy.

01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:33.090
And this simple trick
is just to add N here.

01:04:37.580 --> 01:04:39.640
You add N here.

01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:41.530
In order to get the
correlation function,

01:04:41.530 --> 01:04:45.200
we need to divide it by
N to the power N. Now you

01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:48.460
wanted to get O i, you need
to divide-- take the root of N

01:04:48.460 --> 01:04:55.190
times Ji, so you also need
to divide it by 1 over N.

01:04:55.190 --> 01:04:57.880
But why does this help?

01:04:57.880 --> 01:05:00.220
Why does this help?

01:05:00.220 --> 01:05:01.650
It helps for the
following reason.

01:05:01.650 --> 01:05:06.020
Let me call this whole
thing iS effective.

01:05:10.430 --> 01:05:15.070
iS effective, so
the key thing is

01:05:15.070 --> 01:05:26.360
that this O i, single
trace operators,

01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:37.670
then this S effective
then has the form

01:05:37.670 --> 01:05:39.807
N times the trace something.

01:05:43.690 --> 01:05:48.060
Because you already know S0,
which is our starting point,

01:05:48.060 --> 01:05:49.720
has this form.

01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:54.920
And now the term you added in,
precisely, also has this form,

01:05:54.920 --> 01:05:57.635
is the N factor times
something single trace.

01:06:04.630 --> 01:06:09.370
So that means the whole
thing still has this form.

01:06:09.370 --> 01:06:13.010
Then now we can
immediately conclude

01:06:13.010 --> 01:06:22.200
this log z J1, Jn, must
have this expansion.

01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:28.960
h from 0 to infinity,
and to the 2 minus 2h, f

01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:31.771
h lambda J1, et cetera.

01:06:41.330 --> 01:06:47.130
So adding that N is a
powerful, powerful trick.

01:06:47.130 --> 01:06:52.790
So now you can immediately,
just from here,

01:06:52.790 --> 01:07:13.200
we can immediately find out
that for endpoint function,

01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:18.860
connected endpoint function,
the leading order is 2 minus n,

01:07:18.860 --> 01:07:20.910
because the leading
order is n squared.

01:07:20.910 --> 01:07:23.790
Yeah it's 2 minus n.

01:07:23.790 --> 01:07:28.408
And then suppressed by 1
over N squared, et cetera.

01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:40.800
Good?

01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:44.830
So for example, if you look
at a 0 point function, which

01:07:44.830 --> 01:07:48.440
is essentially the partition
function, so this is order

01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:49.030
N squared.

01:07:49.030 --> 01:07:51.113
So this is what we found
before, to leading order.

01:07:53.510 --> 01:07:55.370
And if you look at the
one point function,

01:07:55.370 --> 01:07:57.110
some operator,
then, will be order

01:07:57.110 --> 01:08:00.750
N. If you look at the two point
function, connected two point

01:08:00.750 --> 01:08:03.910
function of some operator,
so it would be order one.

01:08:03.910 --> 01:08:07.560
And the three point
function of some operator

01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:10.860
will be order 1 over N,
as the leading order.

01:08:14.010 --> 01:08:16.680
And then all higher order
just down by 1 over N

01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:19.010
squared, compared to
the leading order.

01:08:19.010 --> 01:08:23.149
And again, the leading order is
given by the planar diagrams.

01:08:23.149 --> 01:08:25.910
Because of the leading
order contribution to here,

01:08:25.910 --> 01:08:29.210
in terms of this S
effective is planar diagram.

01:08:29.210 --> 01:08:32.180
And then they must be,
under those things,

01:08:32.180 --> 01:08:35.080
just obtained by through
[INAUDIBLE], so they

01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:37.569
must be planar diagrams.

01:08:37.569 --> 01:08:39.435
so again this comes
from planar diagrams.

01:08:44.170 --> 01:08:46.930
Good?

01:08:46.930 --> 01:08:51.189
So now let's talk about the
physical implications of this.

01:08:51.189 --> 01:08:54.439
So what does this mean?

01:08:54.439 --> 01:09:03.710
So we have found out, this is
our N dependence for our gauge

01:09:03.710 --> 01:09:06.229
invariant operators.

01:09:06.229 --> 01:09:07.716
So what does this mean?

01:09:07.716 --> 01:09:09.549
Now let me talk about
physical implications.

01:09:21.994 --> 01:09:25.403
AUDIENCE: What did one of
those [INAUDIBLE] have with--

01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:31.529
HONG LIU: Yeah, I
defined them without chi.

01:09:31.529 --> 01:09:34.180
AUDIENCE: Then something like--

01:09:34.180 --> 01:09:38.140
HONG LIU: You define something.

01:09:38.140 --> 01:09:40.740
So when you write
down your theory,

01:09:40.740 --> 01:09:42.935
you define this 't Hooft limit.

01:09:42.935 --> 01:09:44.810
Then everything is
already in terms of lambda

01:09:44.810 --> 01:09:46.560
or some other order one number.

01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:48.900
So that can depend on those
numbers in an arbitrary way.

01:09:48.900 --> 01:09:50.983
It doesn't matter can
depend on coupling constants

01:09:50.983 --> 01:09:53.710
in an arbitrary, but it cannot
have N dependence defined

01:09:53.710 --> 01:09:56.606
inside the operator.

01:10:00.550 --> 01:10:04.750
Once we introduce
this 't Hooft limit,

01:10:04.750 --> 01:10:12.670
then the operator can depend
on the coupling in the 't Hooft

01:10:12.670 --> 01:10:15.300
limit in an arbitrary way.

01:10:15.300 --> 01:10:17.515
Because they're all just
all the one constant.

01:10:21.270 --> 01:10:24.320
Let's talk about physical
implications of this.

01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:27.210
It turns out, these simple
and [INAUDIBLE] behavior

01:10:27.210 --> 01:10:35.760
actually has a very simple
physical picture behind it.

01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:41.180
So first he said, in the
large N limit-- so let's just

01:10:41.180 --> 01:10:44.630
look at leading order behavior.

01:10:44.630 --> 01:10:51.445
So in a large N limit, if
we consider this state of O

01:10:51.445 --> 01:10:55.250
i x acting on the vacuum.

01:10:55.250 --> 01:10:58.990
So some single trace operator
acting on the vacuum.

01:10:58.990 --> 01:11:00.860
So i, again, just
labels different state,

01:11:00.860 --> 01:11:02.040
different operators.

01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:18.560
These can be interpreted as
creating a "single particle"

01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:19.060
state.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:35.500
I'm first describing
the conclusion.

01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:37.510
Then I will explain why.

01:11:37.510 --> 01:11:39.210
So you can see that
the state obtained

01:11:39.210 --> 01:11:43.030
by adding a single trace
operator on the vacuum,

01:11:43.030 --> 01:11:46.860
then this can be interpreted
as a single particle state.

01:11:46.860 --> 01:11:51.560
So if you add on the double
trace operator on the vacuum,

01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:53.762
then this can be interpreted
as two particle state.

01:11:57.090 --> 01:12:03.110
Similarly, say O n
acting on the vacuum

01:12:03.110 --> 01:12:04.950
would be N particle states.

01:12:10.990 --> 01:12:13.710
So why is this so?

01:12:13.710 --> 01:12:14.726
Why this is so.

01:12:17.540 --> 01:12:24.790
So I will support this
statement using three arguments.

01:12:29.820 --> 01:12:36.150
First remember O i O j, the
connecting Green function

01:12:36.150 --> 01:12:38.350
of any two operators
of order one.

01:12:42.050 --> 01:12:46.500
So we can actually
just diagonalize them.

01:12:46.500 --> 01:13:00.450
If you can just diagonalize
them, so that O i O j

01:13:00.450 --> 01:13:03.960
are proportional to delta i j.

01:13:08.350 --> 01:13:10.940
So in some sense, a
two point function,

01:13:10.940 --> 01:13:13.277
those operators can be
considered as independent.

01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:19.723
And now the second statement.

01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:26.420
So if you want to call
this single particle,

01:13:26.420 --> 01:13:30.870
this two particle, multi
particle, then they

01:13:30.870 --> 01:13:32.430
should be that
they don't overlap.

01:13:32.430 --> 01:13:34.888
Because a single particle cannot
overlap with two particle,

01:13:34.888 --> 01:13:37.260
et cetera.

01:13:37.260 --> 01:13:40.100
And then to see the overlap
between a single particle

01:13:40.100 --> 01:13:44.340
with a multi particle, you look
at these correlation functions.

01:13:44.340 --> 01:13:50.530
So if you look at the overlap
of a single particle state,

01:13:50.530 --> 01:13:53.940
with a two particle state, say
some double trace operator.

01:13:53.940 --> 01:13:55.980
Let me just, to
avoid confusion, let

01:13:55.980 --> 01:14:08.030
me just use the inside--
use this notation

01:14:08.030 --> 01:14:09.610
to see this as a
single operator.

01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:17.010
So you can see
that the overlap we

01:14:17.010 --> 01:14:19.950
saw of the single trace
operator with this double trace

01:14:19.950 --> 01:14:22.190
operator.

01:14:22.190 --> 01:14:24.150
And they start off--
this whole thing

01:14:24.150 --> 01:14:26.860
is like a three point function.

01:14:26.860 --> 01:14:29.616
Just put these two
over the same point.

01:14:29.616 --> 01:14:31.990
So from our discussion here,
is how you connect the Green

01:14:31.990 --> 01:14:36.710
functions of order 1 over N.

01:14:36.710 --> 01:14:45.580
So this goes to 0, compared
to this overlap with itself.

01:14:45.580 --> 01:14:53.350
So that means in the N
goes to infinity limit,

01:14:53.350 --> 01:15:03.350
there is no mixing between
what we called single particle

01:15:03.350 --> 01:15:12.936
state, single trace, and
the multiple trace states.

01:15:31.860 --> 01:15:41.190
So the third thing
is that now let's

01:15:41.190 --> 01:15:56.160
look at the two point function
of two double trace operator.

01:15:56.160 --> 01:16:08.740
So O1 O2 x, say O1 O2 and y.

01:16:08.740 --> 01:16:11.266
OK double trace operators.

01:16:11.266 --> 01:16:12.890
So let's look at the
two point function

01:16:12.890 --> 01:16:14.056
with double trace operators.

01:16:31.530 --> 01:16:34.980
So there's an even
contribution to this.

01:16:34.980 --> 01:16:36.230
So let's include all diagrams.

01:16:36.230 --> 01:16:40.240
Also these can all be
connected So leading order

01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:42.200
is a disconnected diagram,
which is essentially

01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:51.520
O1 x O1 y and O2 x and O2 y.

01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:56.440
Because I have a
diagonal next to them.

01:16:56.440 --> 01:16:59.780
have And then plus
the connected Green

01:16:59.780 --> 01:17:05.856
functions, which is
order 1 over N squared.

01:17:10.390 --> 01:17:13.850
So if you see this leading
order contribution,

01:17:13.850 --> 01:17:17.120
it's just like two independent
particle propagating.

01:17:17.120 --> 01:17:20.650
Just like the product of
two independent propagators.

01:17:20.650 --> 01:17:24.480
So it's sensible
to interpret this

01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:26.350
as just the propagating
of two particles.

01:17:26.350 --> 01:17:28.660
So it's sensible to
interpret this two particle

01:17:28.660 --> 01:17:31.100
state, this double
trace operator

01:17:31.100 --> 01:17:32.900
as just creating some
two particle state.

01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:42.293
Yeah, again this goes to
zero, in the large N limit.

01:17:47.680 --> 01:17:52.920
So I should emphasize when we
call this a single particle

01:17:52.920 --> 01:17:56.550
state, it's not
necessary they really

01:17:56.550 --> 01:18:01.180
exist on a shell particle
corresponding to this state.

01:18:01.180 --> 01:18:04.370
We're just saying that the
behavior of these states

01:18:04.370 --> 01:18:07.660
can be interpreted as some
kind of single particles.

01:18:12.506 --> 01:18:16.170
The behavior you can just
interpret as single particles.

01:18:16.170 --> 01:18:18.810
It's not really
necessary they exist

01:18:18.810 --> 01:18:21.210
as stable on shell particles.

01:18:21.210 --> 01:18:23.900
In certain cases,
there might be.

01:18:23.900 --> 01:18:25.980
There might be actual
particles, actual stable,

01:18:25.980 --> 01:18:28.605
on shell particles associated
with these kind of states.

01:18:28.605 --> 01:18:30.230
But for this
interpretation to be true,

01:18:30.230 --> 01:18:32.320
it does not have to be.

01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:37.970
So in QCD actually sometimes--
so I just say they exist.

01:18:37.970 --> 01:18:39.471
So we call them
"glueball" state.

01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:48.570
For example, in QCD, the
analog of this kind of operator

01:18:48.570 --> 01:18:52.560
can create some state,
which they are short-lived.

01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:53.920
They are not long-lived.

01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:56.030
They quickly decay.

01:18:56.030 --> 01:19:00.180
And so they're typically
called the glueball state.

01:19:00.180 --> 01:19:04.077
So from now on we just
call them glueballs.

01:19:04.077 --> 01:19:04.910
Call them glueballs.

01:19:09.410 --> 01:19:15.740
So this is one of the
first implication--

01:19:15.740 --> 01:19:17.850
the first indication
is that they're just

01:19:17.850 --> 01:19:20.060
a single particles.

01:19:20.060 --> 01:19:21.900
A single trace operator
can be interpreted

01:19:21.900 --> 01:19:24.150
as creating single
particle states,

01:19:24.150 --> 01:19:25.990
and the multiple
trace operator can

01:19:25.990 --> 01:19:28.688
be interpreted as creating
multi particle states.

01:19:31.870 --> 01:19:38.900
Another second, he said if
this glueball operators, so

01:19:38.900 --> 01:19:52.966
fluctuations of
glueballs suppressed.

01:19:59.470 --> 01:20:02.940
So let me explain
what this means.

01:20:02.940 --> 01:20:08.630
So let me suppose some
single trace operator, O,

01:20:08.630 --> 01:20:14.210
which has a non-zero
expectation value,

01:20:14.210 --> 01:20:17.360
suppose some state has a
non-zero expectation value.

01:20:22.650 --> 01:20:25.420
And then let's look at the
variance of this operator,

01:20:25.420 --> 01:20:30.440
the variance of the
expectation value, which

01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:36.452
is given by O squared, minus
O squared for the fluctuation.

01:20:39.450 --> 01:20:44.860
And this is, by definition, just
a collected Green function of O

01:20:44.860 --> 01:20:46.440
squared.

01:20:46.440 --> 01:20:49.280
The is the full O squared.

01:20:49.280 --> 01:20:51.860
This is the disconnected one.

01:20:51.860 --> 01:20:55.560
So this is just a collected
part of the O squared.

01:20:55.560 --> 01:20:57.250
And this one, N
dependence, we know

01:20:57.250 --> 01:20:59.977
this is order one,
order N to the power 0.

01:21:05.080 --> 01:21:09.680
So that means that these
to below this order

01:21:09.680 --> 01:21:22.480
N. So the variance of this,
compared to the expectation

01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:26.890
value of this operator itself is
surprising, the large N limit.

01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:37.050
So essentially, in
the large N limit,

01:21:37.050 --> 01:21:41.380
so that means the variance
provided by the operator

01:21:41.380 --> 01:21:45.600
itself is 1 over N because of
the 0 in the large N limit.

01:21:49.310 --> 01:21:53.010
So assuming that if you have
a two point function-- so

01:21:53.010 --> 01:21:58.430
suppose each two point
function, so each O2

01:21:58.430 --> 01:22:01.340
have a non-zero
expectation value,

01:22:01.340 --> 01:22:05.530
then you can factorize
this O1 O2, plus O1 O2.

01:22:05.530 --> 01:22:09.510
So this is disconnected part.

01:22:09.510 --> 01:22:13.290
And again this will
be of order one.

01:22:13.290 --> 01:22:17.328
But this part is
of order N squared.

01:22:20.930 --> 01:22:25.770
So essentially the disconnected
the part is always factorized.

01:22:25.770 --> 01:22:29.860
So the disconnected part
is always factorized.

01:22:29.860 --> 01:22:32.367
Yeah this connected
part is always small,

01:22:32.367 --> 01:22:33.783
compared to the
disconnected part.

01:22:37.820 --> 01:22:39.480
So this is like a
classical theory.

01:22:50.450 --> 01:22:52.440
AUDIENCE: We have
just five minutes.

01:22:52.440 --> 01:22:54.989
We can proceed before it's 5:00

01:22:54.989 --> 01:22:56.780
HONG LIU: Yeah but it
may go to 10 minutes.

01:22:56.780 --> 01:22:59.840
It's just hard to say.

01:22:59.840 --> 01:23:01.790
It's just hard to say.

01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:09.630
Yeah, let me do it next time.
