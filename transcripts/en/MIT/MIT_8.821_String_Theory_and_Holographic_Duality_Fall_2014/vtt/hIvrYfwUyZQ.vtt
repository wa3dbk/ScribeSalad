00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.650
HONG LIU: OK, so let me
first summarize what we

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.790
did at the end of last lecture.

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:43.990
So we can see that
the Rindler space

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:50.490
can be separated
from the right column

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.960
into into four
different patches.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:03.120
In particular, there's a left
patch and the right patch,

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:13.790
and this is a constant
row slice in the Rindler.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.330
So what we showed is that
the Minkowski vacuum,

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.900
the standards, the
vacuum we defined,

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.990
the Minkowski
quantum field theory,

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:30.560
can be written as
an entangled state,

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.620
and we express it in terms of
the Hilbert space of the left

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:34.670
and the right patch.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.820
So this n sum over all possible
in the [INAUDIBLE] state.

00:01:50.870 --> 00:02:02.780
So this n and n are eigen
vectors, eigen values,

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:12.079
and eigen vectors of the
Rindler Hamiltonian, which

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:12.620
we called HR.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:23.610
And so this, similarly,
is an L. So an R

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.700
means the eigen vector
in the right patch

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.210
and an L is the eigen
vector for the left patch.

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:39.780
And now when you trace out,
for example, the left patch,

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.060
suppose you're only
interested in the physics

00:02:44.060 --> 00:03:01.390
in the right patch when you
trace out the left patch,

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:07.150
then you find the sum of density
matrix for the right patch.

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:16.500
[? Under ?] the [? sum ?] of the
density matrix is the partition

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:25.460
function for the full Rindler
minus 2 pi h and so you

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:29.440
conclude that the
temperature is 1 over 2 pi.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:41.580
So that's what we did at
the end of last lecture.

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.096
So there are several
key elements here.

00:03:45.096 --> 00:03:46.720
So there are several
key elements here.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.910
So the first key element is
that the Minkowski [? ground ?]

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.660
state turned out to
be a particular kind

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.980
of entangled state between
the left and the right patch.

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.510
And then you get the
[? sum ?] of density matrix

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.030
when you have a Lorenz
above the left patch.

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.670
So these are two of
the basic elements.

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.140
So any questions on this?

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.640
Yes.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.105
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
left patch.

00:04:14.105 --> 00:04:17.141
Is there any physical
meaning to the left patch?

00:04:17.141 --> 00:04:19.640
HONG LIU: It's the same physical
meaning to the right patch.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.030
For the observer in the
right patch, of course,

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.269
you don't see the left
patch, and so that's

00:04:35.269 --> 00:04:37.560
why you get the [? sum ?] of
density-- yeah, that's why

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.370
you have to integrate them out.

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.585
Yeah, they play a very
important physical role.

00:04:43.585 --> 00:04:46.435
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
observable [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.300
HONG LIU: This is just
pure Minkowski space.

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.800
Yeah, this is just
pure Minkowski space.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.500
This is Minkowski space.

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.600
So this kind observer can
only observe the right patch,

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.980
so to this kind of
observer then you

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.650
must integrate out all the
physics in the left patch.

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.197
So that's why they
see a similar physics.

00:05:12.197 --> 00:05:14.030
Yeah, so this is just
a physical explanation

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:15.650
why this is similar physics.

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.720
AUDIENCE: Why do we need to
introduce a harmonic oscillator

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.190
during [INAUDIBLE]
HR can be anything?

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.770
I forgot the reason why we
introduced harmonic oscillator.

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:33.690
HONG LIU: Oh, I just
gave you a simple example

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:38.110
to explain this kind of
physics using a simple example.

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:40.830
just in case you're not
familiar with this kind physics

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:43.220
I gave you a simple example
to build up your intuition.

00:05:51.781 --> 00:05:53.780
the reason we considered
the harmonic oscillator

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:57.360
is not an important reason.

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.240
Say if you [? quantize ?]
the scalar field theory-- so

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.520
any theory on this space,
say if you [? quantize ?]

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.590
a free quantum field theory,
that just reduce the harmonic

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:07.860
oscillator.

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.780
So the harmonic
oscillator in fact

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:12.924
have the exact same physics as
general quantum field theory

00:06:12.924 --> 00:06:13.465
you consider.

00:06:17.304 --> 00:06:18.265
Any other questions?

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:23.614
AUDIENCE: May I
repeat my question?

00:06:23.614 --> 00:06:25.452
The right patch, the
[INAUDIBLE] patch,

00:06:25.452 --> 00:06:27.660
corresponds to the exterior
of the black hole, right?

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:34.390
HONG LIU: In the
black hole problem,

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:36.290
the counterpart
of the right patch

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:37.970
is exterior over the black hole.

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:38.650
That's right.

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:40.526
AUDIENCE: So the upper
patch is the interior?

00:06:40.526 --> 00:06:41.483
HONG LIU: That's right.

00:06:41.483 --> 00:06:43.410
AUDIENCE: So what are
the kind of [INAUDIBLE]?

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:46.230
HONG LIU: The left patch is
[INAUDIBLE] asymptotical region

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:49.930
over the black hole, which
is also outside the horizon.

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:53.785
So the extended black hole
has two asymptotical regions.

00:06:53.785 --> 00:06:54.284
Yeah.

00:06:54.284 --> 00:06:57.303
AUDIENCE: So is there any
kind of [INAUDIBLE] way

00:06:57.303 --> 00:06:59.187
with the left patch [INAUDIBLE]?

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:04.130
HONG LIU: Yeah, as I said.

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:06.340
Yeah, I'm going to talk
about this a little bit.

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:08.464
I'm going to talk about
black hole in a little bit.

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:12.260
Any other questions?

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:15.360
Good?

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:24.160
So let me make some
further remarks.

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:44.910
The first is that this Minkowski
vacuum-- this entangled

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:48.710
state between the left
and the right-- is

00:07:48.710 --> 00:08:03.000
invariant under the
[? axim-- ?] Or maybe

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.720
I should say-- let
me just say it.

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:18.040
It's invariant under
HR R minus HR left.

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:29.080
By invariant under this
I mean-- so this state

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:34.570
is [INAUDIBLE] by this, and this
invariant under any translation

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:37.740
generated by this combination.

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:39.360
I'm not using very
precise English,

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:41.610
but I think you
understand what I mean.

00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:44.450
Anyway, so this you can
see immediately from there.

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:51.840
I just [INAUDIBLE] this
harmonic oscillator example,

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:55.990
and if you act this on that--
so this R means Rindler,

00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:59.410
and this R means the right
patch and left patch.

00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:04.230
So act this on that
state, then they just get

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:05.650
an E because of the minus sign.

00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:08.660
They just canceled.

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:14.360
And so this minus
sign is related.

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:18.437
What I said last time is that
you can think of the left patch

00:09:18.437 --> 00:09:20.145
half the time running
over the direction.

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:26.830
By time I mean this
[INAUDIBLE], OK?

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:48.640
So what this operator
gener-- it does

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:55.860
is the generator flow--
there's a generate flow in eta.

00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:58.372
So the eta goes
running to so this

00:09:58.372 --> 00:10:00.330
goes running to [? comes ?]
in the low surface.

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:12.620
And the flow in the right
quadrant is going up,

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:14.370
but in the left quadrant
it should go down

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:16.660
so the time should be moving
[? normally ?] direction,

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:18.243
and that's what this
minus sign means.

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:24.130
And then this
transformation, we'll

00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:25.275
leave this state invariant.

00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:29.270
And you [? graph ?]
the same thing

00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:31.228
like we did before for
the harmonic oscillator.

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:36.120
Any questions on this?

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:39.010
So you can immediately
see from that equation

00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:40.955
this operator
[INAUDIBLE] that state.

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:52.840
So this can also
be-- so do you have

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:55.820
any problems saying that
the HR generated translation

00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:56.470
along this?

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:03.802
Is this clear to you?

00:11:03.802 --> 00:11:06.658
AUDIENCE: So the [INAUDIBLE],
the time [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:06.658 --> 00:11:08.042
are opposite.

00:11:08.042 --> 00:11:13.625
Does it mean that any other
physical is the opposite time

00:11:13.625 --> 00:11:15.050
and [? changing weight ?]?

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:18.020
HONG LIU: It doesn't
matter what you mean.

00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:20.757
It doesn't matter how you
interplay, physically.

00:11:20.757 --> 00:11:23.090
Right now, I'm talking about
the mathematical statement.

00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:26.380
I want to first understand
the mathematical statement.

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:29.610
So this mathematical
statement has two layers.

00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:31.780
Let me write explicitly.

00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:53.770
This means i HR R minus HL, HR
left acting on 0N with reach

00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:58.020
any eta this is invariant.

00:11:58.020 --> 00:11:58.770
This is invariant.

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:06.030
This, you can just
see directly from that

00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:09.850
the fact this
[INAUDIBLE] that state.

00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:13.520
And then that means
that this thing

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:16.240
leaves this thing invariant.

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:22.410
Under the action of
this guy, this operator,

00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:25.360
from the point of view of the
red patch because one thing,

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:28.150
you generate the
translation in the eta

00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:31.700
because HR is the
[INAUDIBLE] for the eta,

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:35.340
so this just generates
the translation in eta,

00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:37.530
which leaves rho invariant.

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:41.450
And this slice I'm showing here
is the constant, the rho slice,

00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:44.410
so that means this generates
a translation along that arrow

00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:49.500
direction, moving
to positive time.

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:53.030
And this minus sign means
that, in the left patch--

00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:54.660
because [INAUDIBLE]
transformation

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:57.450
we are moving
[? in the only ?] direction.

00:12:57.450 --> 00:13:01.820
And then that operation, we
will leave this state invariant.

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:02.340
Yes.

00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:03.010
AUDIENCE: So one question.

00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:04.730
So sometimes people have
this interpretation--

00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:06.430
I'm not sure if this picture is
correct-- but in the black hole

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:08.040
picture, we interpret
the bottom thing

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:10.560
as being some sort of white
hole, which sort of spews out

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:11.550
things.

00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:14.290
So if we reverse time, then does
it sort of become a black hole

00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:15.780
again because now it's--

00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:16.520
HONG LIU: No, no.

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:18.561
We are talking about
completely different things.

00:13:18.561 --> 00:13:21.750
Here, I'm just talking about--
in the left and in the right

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:25.280
you can choose whatever
time direction you want.

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:28.080
I'm just making a
statement that said,

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:33.800
if I make this
kind of operation--

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:38.250
do a time translation in
the positive time direction,

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:41.280
but in the opposite time
direction in the left--

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:46.565
that particular operation
leaves the this state invariant.

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:53.030
For physical applications
you can choose whatever time

00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:55.550
direction you want.

00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:57.620
You can choose whatever
time direction you want.

00:13:57.620 --> 00:13:59.330
And this is a
mathematical statement

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:03.330
saying this particular operator
leaves this state invariant,

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:05.445
and this particular
operator half

00:14:05.445 --> 00:14:08.800
of the interpretation of
generate opposite time

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:11.410
translation in the left
and the right patch.

00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:18.200
So this is an
algebraic statement,

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:21.931
but this can also be
seen geometrically.

00:14:21.931 --> 00:14:23.430
This can also be
seen geometrically.

00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:32.500
So if you work out the relation
between the Minkowski's

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:44.680
coordinates and the
Rindler coordinates,

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:48.650
you can actually
immediately just see

00:14:48.650 --> 00:15:03.230
is that, geometrically,
eta translation is a boost.

00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:15.720
in x, T. So what that does,
it just generates a boost.

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:17.800
So if this is not
immediately clear to you,

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:22.920
just go back and try to look at
a translation between the two

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:23.420
coordinates.

00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:26.360
Then you will see
it immediately.

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:31.960
So in other words, this HR
actually generates a boost.

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:37.160
This Hamiltonian essentially
generates a boost.

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:39.190
This Rindler Hamiltonian
generates a boost.

00:15:43.470 --> 00:15:43.970
One second.

00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:45.660
Let me finish.

00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:53.140
So, clearly, by definition,
the Minkowski vacuum

00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:54.500
is invariant on the boost.

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:06.540
So this statement is
essentially the statement

00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:11.190
that this thing is
invariant on the boost.

00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:15.210
And then you can see
this negative sign.

00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:18.750
Then you can see the
negative sign from the fact

00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:22.990
that if you make
a Lorenz boost--

00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:25.890
and this is the trajectory
of the Lorenz boost,

00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:29.629
and it acts off the direction
in the left and in the right.

00:16:29.629 --> 00:16:31.420
So that's why there's
a negative sign here.

00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:37.100
So this negative sign
goes [? bonds, ?]

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:39.120
so the geometric
statement that when

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:42.190
you make a Lorentz boost
in the Minkowski plane,

00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:44.430
and the action on the
left and on the right

00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:47.830
is in the opposite
direction, so the same boost

00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:52.920
will take a point here to there,
but we'll take a point here

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:54.850
to here.

00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:57.100
And you can check yourself.

00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:59.440
And this translates into
an algebraic statement--

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:01.010
just become this statement.

00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:04.079
And this statement is
the same-- that this

00:17:04.079 --> 00:17:07.079
is invariant on the boost.

00:17:07.079 --> 00:17:10.290
So this is the first remark.

00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:23.344
And the second remark is that,
if we expand the field phi

00:17:23.344 --> 00:17:33.387
R in the right patch in terms
of a complete set of modes,

00:17:33.387 --> 00:17:34.970
just ask, what do
you normally do when

00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:36.178
you do canonical [INAUDIBLE]?

00:17:52.990 --> 00:18:18.680
In the right patch,
say-- so this

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:20.470
defines a [INAUDIBLE]
and the creation

00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:27.830
operators for the theory
in the right patch.

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:31.290
And, similarly, you can
do it in the left patch.

00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:35.460
And then you can show, just
based on that relation--

00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:37.654
just based on that
relation, you can show--

00:18:37.654 --> 00:18:39.820
so let's consider the
freescale [? of ?] [? field ?]

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:44.110
[? series ?] so you
can show that this--

00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:48.920
just as the harmonic oscillator
example we discussed before--

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:55.340
and this Minkowski state can
be written as a [? squeezed ?]

00:18:55.340 --> 00:19:01.470
state in terms of
[? their ?] vacuum.

00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:07.780
And now you have to take the
product of all possible modes,

00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:10.010
and only the j is the
frequency for each mode.

00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:25.510
So this is a precise analog
of the harmonic oscillator

00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:29.820
example, just because
each set of modes

00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:31.470
gives you a harmonic oscillator.

00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:33.136
So you just take the
[INAUDIBLE] product

00:19:33.136 --> 00:19:35.130
of all these
harmonic oscillators,

00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:38.600
and then you have this relation.

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:53.510
Also, very similarly,
the usual Minkowski

00:19:53.510 --> 00:20:06.210
creation and the relation
operators are related.

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:39.010
So this ajr, ajl by Bogoliubov
transformations, just

00:20:39.010 --> 00:20:45.740
as the harmonic
oscillator example.

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:54.110
So we are allowed to write
this transformation explicitly.

00:20:57.990 --> 00:21:00.330
But he's saying here,
just direct generalize

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:02.634
of the harmonic
oscillator example

00:21:02.634 --> 00:21:04.300
because the field
series is just a bunch

00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:05.300
of harmonic oscillators.

00:21:07.439 --> 00:21:09.730
A field series is just a
bunch of harmonic oscillators.

00:21:12.302 --> 00:21:13.760
Any questions
regarding this point?

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:21.180
Yes.

00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:26.776
AUDIENCE: So, just to
check-- so the right only

00:21:26.776 --> 00:21:29.150
affects the right patch and
its identity everywhere else.

00:21:29.150 --> 00:21:29.870
HONG LIU: Sure.

00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:32.752
AUDIENCE: So that the
combination leaves the bottom

00:21:32.752 --> 00:21:36.222
and the top portion just fixed.

00:21:36.222 --> 00:21:38.040
So the combination
leaves the bottom

00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:40.520
and the top quarter fixed?

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:48.010
HONG LIU: You don't get back
to the-- yeah, when we-- yeah,

00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:54.160
so this is-- so this
operation itself does not

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:58.160
direct-- so this operation
itself does not direct access

00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:00.970
to the top and bottom portion.

00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:03.054
And this is a
[? trajectoral ?] for them.

00:22:03.054 --> 00:22:04.470
So if you have a
point there, just

00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:06.490
take them to the
[? hyperbolic ?] trajectory.

00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:07.854
So we're not taking to there.

00:22:07.854 --> 00:22:08.520
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:11.244
And the top and the bottom
are just-- it's [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:15.239
So it keeps them fixed?

00:22:15.239 --> 00:22:15.780
HONG LIU: No.

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:20.550
When you define
the Hilbert space,

00:22:20.550 --> 00:22:22.440
you only define for
the left and the right

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:24.660
because they don't
define Hilbert space.

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:30.850
The Hilbert space defines
the given time slice,

00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:33.460
so that only includes
the left and the right.

00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:36.600
And those particles run
into future evolution,

00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:41.070
and that evolution is
not controlled by them

00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:44.720
because they only take you
along the hyperbolic trajectory.

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:52.000
Any other questions?

00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:56.770
Good?

00:22:56.770 --> 00:23:08.350
So the third remark is
that all of the discussions

00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:41.770
generalizes in complete parallel
to Schwarzschild space time

00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:51.410
In particular, we said
before, the Schwarzschild time

00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:54.770
have the falling space
time causal structure.

00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:58.280
You have a whole-- so this
is your regional region

00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:07.067
outside the horizon,
but then you

00:24:07.067 --> 00:24:11.970
can extend this part of the
space time into four regions.

00:24:11.970 --> 00:24:14.510
In particular, you
have two-- again,

00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:18.890
you have R and L-- two
asymptotical regions.

00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:21.650
So this way the R
goes to infinity,

00:24:21.650 --> 00:24:26.230
and similarly this way,
also, R goes infinity.

00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:33.660
So, again, in this
[INAUDIBLE] vacuum state,

00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:37.456
which it can be defined
from going to create

00:24:37.456 --> 00:24:39.830
the [? signature ?] and the
[? compact ?] [INAUDIBLE] phi

00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:42.300
this tau.

00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:44.230
Again, corresponding
to an entangled state

00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:47.070
between the left and the right.

00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:49.270
And if you ignore the
left, again, you'll

00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:51.937
get a similar state
from the right.

00:24:51.937 --> 00:24:53.520
So the story's
completely in parallel.

00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:57.840
It's what we discussed before.

00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:03.930
The only different thing
is the technicalities

00:25:03.930 --> 00:25:06.585
that, of course, in the
specific metric are different.

00:25:06.585 --> 00:25:08.185
The specific metric
are different.

00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:13.960
And in particular,
this [INAUDIBLE] vacuum

00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:17.535
can be obtained by doing
Euclidean paths integral.

00:25:20.150 --> 00:25:26.570
Again, will be the half space,
so this is the tau direction.

00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:32.480
Again, you do the half
space, and the times S2.

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:37.450
It's the same thing exactly
as we did for the Rindler.

00:25:42.330 --> 00:25:46.717
You do the half
space and when you're

00:25:46.717 --> 00:25:49.050
interpreting in terms of this
tau [? foliation ?], which

00:25:49.050 --> 00:25:53.612
is angle, then you get
this entangled state.

00:25:53.612 --> 00:25:54.820
You get this entangled state.

00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:58.740
So any questions on this?

00:25:58.740 --> 00:25:59.360
Yes.

00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:00.443
AUDIENCE: Just to clarify.

00:26:00.443 --> 00:26:02.450
So this entangled
state is really

00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:05.170
nothing more than a
mathematical trick to help us?

00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:07.010
Or should I think
about it physically?

00:26:07.010 --> 00:26:08.218
HONG LIU: No, this is a fact.

00:26:08.218 --> 00:26:11.190
This is not a
mathematical trick.

00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:16.920
If we're grabbing that
case, the Minkowski vacuum

00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:19.580
is entangled state.

00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:22.710
If you write it in terms of
the Hilbert space over the left

00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:24.170
and the right patch.

00:26:24.170 --> 00:26:25.930
This is a mathematical fact.

00:26:25.930 --> 00:26:29.260
This is not a
mathematical trick.

00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:31.860
AUDIENCE: Well in the sense
that I'm perfectly also allowed,

00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:34.174
I can create something
which, in my patch,

00:26:34.174 --> 00:26:35.882
gives me the same
description-- if I just

00:26:35.882 --> 00:26:37.480
think of a perfectly
thermal state,

00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:38.660
and I don't even have to
think about that being

00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:40.070
en entangled with anything.

00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:41.810
Is that also OK?

00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:43.690
HONG LIU: Oh, sure.

00:26:43.690 --> 00:26:48.360
Yeah, but I'm just
telling you-- if you

00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:50.920
are observer in the
right patch, of course

00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:53.920
you will never see
anything on the left patch.

00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:56.220
I'm just giving you a
physical explanation.

00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:57.732
Where does that
physically-- where

00:26:57.732 --> 00:26:59.440
does that thermal
[? nature ?] come from?

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:00.272
AUDIENCE: Sure, OK.

00:27:00.272 --> 00:27:00.690
Yeah.

00:27:00.690 --> 00:27:01.940
I just wanted to clarify that.

00:27:03.955 --> 00:27:05.580
AUDIENCE: Is this
Minkowski [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:08.520
defined in the upper patch?

00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:09.830
HONG LIU: Sorry?

00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:10.860
Yeah.

00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:14.766
So you're talking
about this upper patch?

00:27:14.766 --> 00:27:16.550
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:27:16.550 --> 00:27:20.670
HONG LIU: So the stories are
[? falling. ?] In the standard

00:27:20.670 --> 00:27:23.500
[? QFT, ?] in the
Minkowski spacetime,

00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:28.080
you define whatever your states
at [INAUDIBLE] equal to 0,

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:30.410
then you move this time.

00:27:30.410 --> 00:27:34.400
Then, of course, that
will include this part.

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:37.080
And then the standard
Minkowski time evolution,

00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:40.800
in terms of capital T,
will include this part.

00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:44.430
But if you do the
Rindler time evolution,

00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:47.580
then you will not
involve that part.

00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:48.080
Yeah.

00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:48.850
Is that what you are asking?

00:27:48.850 --> 00:27:50.891
AUDIENCE: So it's not
defined in the upper patch?

00:27:50.891 --> 00:27:51.638
HONG LIU: Hmm?

00:27:51.638 --> 00:27:53.659
AUDIENCE: So it's not
defined in upper patch?

00:27:53.659 --> 00:27:54.200
HONG LIU: No.

00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:58.910
It's not-- it just does not
access those informations,

00:27:58.910 --> 00:28:03.550
because the time translation
is always like this.

00:28:03.550 --> 00:28:05.570
The time translation
will always--

00:28:05.570 --> 00:28:09.040
will never take you there.

00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:13.460
You have to ask, what is
your time translation?

00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:18.550
So in quantum mechanics,
you define an initial state

00:28:18.550 --> 00:28:20.860
and then you have
a [? tone ?] intake

00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:24.200
you wove into future time.

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:28.700
And in-- then,
depend on which time

00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:33.260
you use, then cover different
regions of the Minkowski

00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:34.640
spacetime.

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:36.830
If you use the standard
Minkowski time,

00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:39.460
capital T, then that
will cover everything.

00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:42.340
If you only use
the Rindler time,

00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:45.200
then that only covers this
region or this region.

00:28:51.312 --> 00:28:52.145
Any other questions?

00:28:56.701 --> 00:28:57.200
Good.

00:28:59.930 --> 00:29:00.700
The fourth remark.

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:09.740
So now, let me call this--
so this is r and l and then

00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:11.176
this f.

00:29:11.176 --> 00:29:12.710
OK?

00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:15.910
So let me call this region f.

00:29:15.910 --> 00:29:22.840
So this story, experienced
perfectly in this Schwarzschild

00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:28.750
spacetime, why an
observer in infinity

00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:33.905
will see, say,
thermal radiation.

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:38.440
But actually, this
does not apply

00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:46.340
to the real-life black holes,
because the black hole formed

00:29:46.340 --> 00:30:04.074
by gravitational collapse
only have the right

00:30:04.074 --> 00:30:04.990
and the future region.

00:30:08.650 --> 00:30:12.290
You don't have the left region.

00:30:12.290 --> 00:30:14.710
You don't have the left region.

00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:15.210
OK?

00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:24.730
So this discussion
does not apply.

00:30:24.730 --> 00:30:26.320
OK?

00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:29.510
This discussion does not apply.

00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:33.700
But this is only one of the ways
to derive that the black hole

00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:35.620
have a finite temperature.

00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:38.280
In fact, the Hawkings
original derivation,

00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:42.510
just by considering
scalar field,

00:30:42.510 --> 00:30:45.720
just by considering
quantizing scalar field alone,

00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:47.970
in the right patch,
and he already

00:30:47.970 --> 00:30:53.112
did deduce the thermal nature.

00:30:53.112 --> 00:30:54.820
So even though this
particular discussion

00:30:54.820 --> 00:31:01.140
does not apply,
all our conclusion,

00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:03.380
all our conclusion does apply.

00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:03.880
OK?

00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:09.830
Our conclusion does
apply, including

00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:12.020
the finite
temperature, et cetera.

00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:16.120
OK?

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:24.747
So now, to interpret, where
does this temperature come from?

00:31:24.747 --> 00:31:27.080
And later we will say, actually,
the black hole not only

00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:31.330
have a temperature, it can
satisfy all the thermodynamics.

00:31:31.330 --> 00:31:33.250
So in this case,
to interpret where

00:31:33.250 --> 00:31:37.390
this temperature come from
is physically more intricate.

00:31:37.390 --> 00:31:37.890
OK?

00:31:37.890 --> 00:31:40.030
So I will not try to do it now.

00:31:40.030 --> 00:31:44.950
But later, when we talk
about the duality, and then

00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:48.270
that will be a better place
to go back to this question.

00:31:48.270 --> 00:31:51.830
And then we can ask the precise
difference between these two

00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:52.330
cases.

00:31:52.330 --> 00:31:57.370
Between the case which
you have all patches,

00:31:57.370 --> 00:31:59.290
and the case which
you only have two

00:31:59.290 --> 00:32:01.400
pat-- only have two regions.

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:04.870
And that they are, actually,
physically fundamentally

00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:06.230
different.

00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:08.380
Physically
fundamentally different.

00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:11.960
But the reason those
conclusion applies

00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:15.510
is because the
temperature, in fact,

00:32:15.510 --> 00:32:18.570
is a state that can be
made by the local observer.

00:32:18.570 --> 00:32:22.070
For local observer,
outside the horizon,

00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:25.890
he's not going to tell the
difference between this metric

00:32:25.890 --> 00:32:30.090
and the exac-- and the
almost identical metric

00:32:30.090 --> 00:32:30.990
in outside horizon.

00:32:30.990 --> 00:32:32.830
Outside the horizon,
Schwarzschild metric

00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:34.547
is a perfect one.

00:32:34.547 --> 00:32:36.380
So locally, he will not
tell any difference.

00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:38.820
So that's why the local
observer should always

00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:40.170
see the temperature.

00:32:40.170 --> 00:32:44.400
If you see it in one case, you
will see it in the other case.

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:45.770
OK?

00:32:45.770 --> 00:32:48.791
But the underlying physics will
turn out to be very different.

00:32:48.791 --> 00:32:49.290
Yes?

00:32:49.290 --> 00:32:51.882
AUDIENCE: How are we
defining temperature here?

00:32:51.882 --> 00:32:54.875
Are we defining it by means of
energy, like we do [INAUDIBLE]?

00:32:54.875 --> 00:32:55.500
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:55.860
Yeah.

00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:56.360
Yeah.

00:32:56.360 --> 00:33:00.147
Yeah, here, we define it in
terms of the density matrix.

00:33:00.147 --> 00:33:01.980
AUDIENCE: Oh, it's
defined by that equation?

00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:02.646
HONG LIU: Right.

00:33:02.646 --> 00:33:03.420
Yeah.

00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:08.500
So the density matrix-- so if
you have a density matrix like

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:16.600
this, which z is traced explain
[? to ?] [? matters ?] beta h,

00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:19.740
then you say the temperature
is one over beta.

00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:21.460
So that's how we
define temperature

00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:23.710
in quantum statistical physics.

00:33:23.710 --> 00:33:24.210
Yeah.

00:33:24.210 --> 00:33:24.550
Yeah.

00:33:24.550 --> 00:33:25.110
Yeah.

00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:28.370
So this defines a
canonical example for you.

00:33:28.370 --> 00:33:31.397
And this beta is the
temperature, the [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:31.397 --> 00:33:31.897
temperature.

00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:35.910
OK.

00:33:35.910 --> 00:33:36.995
So any questions on this?

00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:43.590
I hope not, because I want to
discuss this later, not now.

00:33:48.367 --> 00:33:48.950
AUDIENCE: Sir?

00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:50.100
HONG LIU: Yes?

00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:54.944
AUDIENCE: If we hold up
a thermometer like this,

00:33:54.944 --> 00:33:57.510
should we get some
different temperature

00:33:57.510 --> 00:33:59.810
than if we let it fall?

00:33:59.810 --> 00:34:02.430
It's accelerated right now.

00:34:02.430 --> 00:34:04.520
Can this has been measured?

00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:06.590
HONG LIU: No.

00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:08.929
Because it's too
low, the temperature.

00:34:08.929 --> 00:34:10.310
Right.

00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:12.122
Yeah.

00:34:12.122 --> 00:34:13.580
Yeah, because our
temperature would

00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:16.699
be much bigger than
this temperature

00:34:16.699 --> 00:34:18.530
you are able to-- yeah.

00:34:18.530 --> 00:34:23.880
Just the fluctuation
of air in this room

00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:27.019
will create fluctuations in
temperature which much higher

00:34:27.019 --> 00:34:28.269
than that kind of temperature.

00:34:28.269 --> 00:34:30.519
AUDIENCE: In space,
can be a vacuum.

00:34:30.519 --> 00:34:32.060
HONG LIU: In the
space, you also have

00:34:32.060 --> 00:34:34.179
to do very precise measurement.

00:34:34.179 --> 00:34:37.060
It's-- yeah, you
have to calculate it.

00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:39.870
h bar is very small.

00:34:39.870 --> 00:34:42.929
AUDIENCE: Divide by the mass.

00:34:42.929 --> 00:34:44.440
HONG LIU: Yes?

00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:47.400
AUDIENCE: To-- constructing
on that same question.

00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:51.040
So the same thermometer that
is being held in position.

00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:54.370
So if I observe it
while sitting down here,

00:34:54.370 --> 00:34:58.950
so I'm accelerating with it,
I'm like the Rindler observer,

00:34:58.950 --> 00:35:01.502
and I would see it at a
certain temperature, right?

00:35:01.502 --> 00:35:03.335
Although it's very
small, so we haven't been

00:35:03.335 --> 00:35:04.830
able to measure everything.

00:35:04.830 --> 00:35:07.010
But if I am,
instead, free-falling

00:35:07.010 --> 00:35:09.890
while the thermometer
is being held in place,

00:35:09.890 --> 00:35:13.504
would I then not see-- would I
then not measure a temperature?

00:35:13.504 --> 00:35:14.670
Would I measure temperature?

00:35:14.670 --> 00:35:15.030
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:15.529
Yeah.

00:35:15.529 --> 00:35:17.340
You wouldn't be able
to see a temperature.

00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:17.840
Yeah.

00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:18.842
Free-falling.

00:35:18.842 --> 00:35:19.675
Although won't see--

00:35:19.675 --> 00:35:21.216
AUDIENCE: So the
thermometer is being

00:35:21.216 --> 00:35:22.989
held-- so the thermometer
is accelerating?

00:35:22.989 --> 00:35:23.530
HONG LIU: No.

00:35:23.530 --> 00:35:25.732
Thermometer is
also free-falling.

00:35:25.732 --> 00:35:27.940
No, if you free-fall, the
thermometer also free-fall.

00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:30.106
AUDIENCE: No, no, I mean--
he holds the thermometer,

00:35:30.106 --> 00:35:32.753
and he is sitting in
his chair, but I'm

00:35:32.753 --> 00:35:36.484
the one who measures the
reading on the thermometer,

00:35:36.484 --> 00:35:37.448
and I'm free-falling.

00:35:40.830 --> 00:35:43.960
HONG LIU: Yeah, that's
an intricate experiment.

00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:47.500
Then we have to analyze that.

00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:50.310
So the photon from
his thermometer

00:35:50.310 --> 00:35:54.250
then will somehow go into your
eyes, and you will analyze it.

00:35:54.250 --> 00:35:57.080
Then whatever is the
reading on his thermometer,

00:35:57.080 --> 00:35:58.450
you will see it.

00:35:58.450 --> 00:36:00.459
Yeah.

00:36:00.459 --> 00:36:02.000
No, you're not doing
any measurement.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.805
You just see the reading
on his thermometer.

00:36:03.805 --> 00:36:05.346
If his thermometer
has a temperature,

00:36:05.346 --> 00:36:06.706
then you will see a temperature.

00:36:06.706 --> 00:36:08.956
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:36:08.956 --> 00:36:11.330
HONG LIU: Yeah, you are not
doing a measurement yourself.

00:36:11.330 --> 00:36:12.050
AUDIENCE: So, OK.

00:36:12.050 --> 00:36:15.360
So now, bringing it back to
non-gravitational physics,

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:16.940
flat spacetime.

00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:19.650
I'm a [? neutral ?] observer,
and I see a thermometer

00:36:19.650 --> 00:36:21.030
accelerating by me.

00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:26.350
I would therefore see it as
reading a certain temperature?

00:36:26.350 --> 00:36:29.592
The thermometer itself
isn't a measurement.

00:36:29.592 --> 00:36:31.550
You need to have something
to measure yourself.

00:36:31.550 --> 00:36:33.990
HONG LIU: Yeah, it's
not [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:34.800
AUDIENCE: Sorry?

00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:35.530
HONG LIU: No.

00:36:35.530 --> 00:36:38.000
No, the thermometer--
whatever thermometer

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:44.090
is doing, what you are doing--
you just read the thermometer.

00:36:44.090 --> 00:36:47.320
And it has nothing to do
whether the thermometer has

00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:48.040
a temperature.

00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:49.350
Thermometer maybe
have a temperature

00:36:49.350 --> 00:36:50.391
due to some other reason.

00:36:50.391 --> 00:36:52.085
Whether you have--
what you could do

00:36:52.085 --> 00:36:54.770
is just read that thing.

00:36:54.770 --> 00:36:55.270
Yeah.

00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:00.490
HONG LIU: OK.

00:37:00.490 --> 00:37:01.935
So let me continue.

00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:25.361
OK.

00:37:25.361 --> 00:37:27.360
So now, we found a black
hole has a temperature.

00:37:30.580 --> 00:37:37.240
So then, you only need to take
a very small leap of faith.

00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:41.190
Saying, if this guy
has a temperature,

00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:43.350
then it should satisfy
thermodynamics.

00:37:43.350 --> 00:37:45.100
OK?

00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:52.040
Then we say, this must
obey thermodynamics.

00:38:01.130 --> 00:38:01.787
OK?

00:38:01.787 --> 00:38:02.870
Also obeys thermodynamics.

00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:03.369
Black hole.

00:38:08.277 --> 00:38:09.860
And then, you
immediately deduce there

00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:13.740
should be entropy,
because now you

00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:16.550
can just apply the first law.

00:38:16.550 --> 00:38:21.580
For example, we have the
thermodynamical relation dSdE

00:38:21.580 --> 00:38:24.220
should be 1 over t.

00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:25.180
OK?

00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:28.604
Say, if we think of
t as a function of e,

00:38:28.604 --> 00:38:30.020
then by integrating
this equation,

00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:35.190
we should deduce what is the
entropy of the black hole.

00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:40.920
So remember the t of the black
hole is 1 over-- remember,

00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:46.780
the t of the black hole,
the t of the black hole.

00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:49.550
Yeah, let me do it here.

00:38:49.550 --> 00:38:53.380
t b h of the black
hole is h bar kappa

00:38:53.380 --> 00:39:00.155
divided by 2 pi, which is the
h bar divided by 8 pi g n times

00:39:00.155 --> 00:39:00.655
m.

00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:12.380
So this would be just
8 pi g n times m h bar.

00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:14.970
Of course, you identify
the mass of the black hole

00:39:14.970 --> 00:39:20.430
with its [? image. ?]
So you identify them.

00:39:20.430 --> 00:39:23.890
So now, you can
just integrate this.

00:39:23.890 --> 00:39:27.840
You can just now become
a trivial exercise.

00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:33.870
Then you find s e
is equal to 4 pi

00:39:33.870 --> 00:39:38.470
g n e square divided by h bar.

00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:42.240
And the plus
integration constant.

00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:44.740
OK?

00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:47.140
And this integration
constant we can

00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:50.830
say to be zero, because
if the black hole have

00:39:50.830 --> 00:39:53.600
zero mass, of course
there's nothing there.

00:39:53.600 --> 00:40:00.370
And so then, we just
have this formula.

00:40:00.370 --> 00:40:03.480
So this formula can be written
a little bit more geometrically.

00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:08.330
So also remember, the black
hole-- the Schwarzschild radius

00:40:08.330 --> 00:40:11.255
is 2 g n m.

00:40:11.255 --> 00:40:13.030
OK?

00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:17.130
So this can be written a little
bit in the geometric way.

00:40:17.130 --> 00:40:24.630
So this can be written in terms
of s 4 pi r s square divided

00:40:24.630 --> 00:40:28.160
by 4 h bar g n.

00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:28.660
OK?

00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:32.410
Now g n goes to the
downstairs, because the r s

00:40:32.410 --> 00:40:34.680
contain two powers of g n.

00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:41.110
So this is given by the horizon
area of the black hole, divided

00:40:41.110 --> 00:40:44.390
by 4 h bar g n.

00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:44.890
OK?

00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:52.990
So now we conclude--
we conclude just

00:40:52.990 --> 00:40:56.660
a bit-- let's connect these
two formulas together.

00:40:56.660 --> 00:40:58.200
The temperature
of the black hole

00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:02.740
is h bar times the surface
gravity divided by 2 pi.

00:41:02.740 --> 00:41:08.580
And the entropy of a black hole
is the area of the black hole,

00:41:08.580 --> 00:41:13.700
area of the horizon of the black
hole, divided by 4 h bar g m.

00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:15.670
So as I said before,
for the black hole,

00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:19.930
there are two very important
geometric quantities.

00:41:19.930 --> 00:41:22.730
One is kappa, surface gravity.

00:41:22.730 --> 00:41:24.790
The other is the horizon area.

00:41:24.790 --> 00:41:28.970
And then they enter in a very--
in a nice and simple way,

00:41:28.970 --> 00:41:31.880
into the temperature
and the horizon--

00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:34.930
the entropy of a black hole.

00:41:34.930 --> 00:41:36.410
And let me call
this equation one.

00:41:36.410 --> 00:41:37.740
This is an important equation.

00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:49.410
So let me just note one thing.

00:41:49.410 --> 00:41:51.840
This temperature
is rather funny,

00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:56.140
if you look at that
formula, because the mass is

00:41:56.140 --> 00:41:58.800
in the downstairs.

00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:02.240
Say, if you increase the mass,
then the temperature actually

00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:03.730
decrease.

00:42:03.730 --> 00:42:07.670
This is actually opposite
to your everyday experience.

00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:08.700
OK?

00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:10.880
Because when we
increase the mass,

00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:14.410
the black hole
temperature decreases.

00:42:14.410 --> 00:42:14.910
OK?

00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:26.030
If you calculate the,
say, specific heat,

00:42:26.030 --> 00:42:29.950
the specific heat is
smaller than zero.

00:42:29.950 --> 00:42:31.240
OK.

00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:34.845
So we will later
see this is actually

00:42:34.845 --> 00:42:39.820
an artifact of a black hole in
asymptotically flat spacetime.

00:42:39.820 --> 00:42:42.660
So here, we're considering black
holes in asymptotically flat

00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:44.230
spacetime.

00:42:44.230 --> 00:42:46.590
If you think about black
holes, say, in the spacetime

00:42:46.590 --> 00:42:50.390
like [INAUDIBLE] space, and
then actually, the temperature

00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:51.865
will go up with the mass.

00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:55.710
As in the ordinary story.

00:42:55.710 --> 00:42:56.300
OK?

00:42:56.300 --> 00:42:59.810
So this is just
the third remark.

00:42:59.810 --> 00:43:05.460
So another third remark is that
this equation, these equations

00:43:05.460 --> 00:43:07.940
tend not to be universal.

00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:13.650
So we derive it to the simplest
Schwarzschild black hole,

00:43:13.650 --> 00:43:18.360
but actually, those relations
apply to all black holes

00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:20.180
have been discovered.

00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:22.290
Just apply to every black hole.

00:43:22.290 --> 00:43:24.040
OK?

00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:27.130
So now let me talk about
general black holes.

00:43:42.130 --> 00:43:45.750
So we are mostly just
making some statements.

00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:47.520
Because most of the
statement I make here,

00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:49.620
they are highly nontrivial.

00:43:49.620 --> 00:43:51.550
And each statement
may take one lecture

00:43:51.550 --> 00:43:55.460
to prove, or even more, so I
will not really prove them.

00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:57.640
I just [? coat ?] them.

00:43:57.640 --> 00:44:00.210
And I can also not
prove it on the spot.

00:44:04.700 --> 00:44:08.710
So first is something
called the no-hair theorem.

00:44:16.310 --> 00:44:24.340
So no-hair theorem says that
stationary-- stationary's

00:44:24.340 --> 00:44:33.640
a key word-- and asymptotically
flat-- this is also

00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:52.480
a key word-- black hole
is fully characterized

00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:56.725
by the first, mass.

00:45:00.530 --> 00:45:02.430
Second, angular momentum.

00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:20.010
Third, conserved gauge charges.

00:45:24.820 --> 00:45:25.320
OK?

00:45:31.689 --> 00:45:34.230
So the Schwarzschild black hole
we talked about corresponding

00:45:34.230 --> 00:45:37.850
to a special case, which
angular momentum is zero,

00:45:37.850 --> 00:45:40.546
and the conserved charge--
yeah, conserved charge--

00:45:40.546 --> 00:45:41.920
for example, the
electric charge.

00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:50.977
For example, electric charge.

00:45:50.977 --> 00:45:52.470
OK?

00:45:52.470 --> 00:45:55.500
And so-- yeah, so
let me just give

00:45:55.500 --> 00:46:00.310
some-- so typically
we denote mass by m,

00:46:00.310 --> 00:46:04.754
and angular momentum by j,
and the electric charge by q.

00:46:04.754 --> 00:46:06.420
So the Schwarzschild
black hole goes one

00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:09.870
into the j equal to zero,
and the q equal to zero,

00:46:09.870 --> 00:46:14.082
but more general black holes
you can have both j and the q.

00:46:17.180 --> 00:46:21.240
So for our-- in
string theory, there

00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:23.535
can be many, many
different gauge fields.

00:46:23.535 --> 00:46:25.260
So in string theory,
actually there

00:46:25.260 --> 00:46:26.935
are many, many
different charges.

00:46:26.935 --> 00:46:28.310
So black holes,
in string theory,

00:46:28.310 --> 00:46:32.660
can have many, many more
charges than, say, just

00:46:32.660 --> 00:46:34.586
in the standard model.

00:46:34.586 --> 00:46:35.710
Just in the standard model.

00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:38.460
Yeah.

00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:43.410
Just for all those black holes,
this equation one still holds.

00:46:43.410 --> 00:46:46.060
OK?

00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:46.930
Yes?

00:46:46.930 --> 00:46:49.520
AUDIENCE: So in
proving this theorem,

00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:52.610
we're going to kind of start
off with a certain definition

00:46:52.610 --> 00:46:55.880
of what is a black hole and
what isn't a black hole.

00:46:55.880 --> 00:46:58.550
So what is the key
feature that defines it?

00:46:58.550 --> 00:47:00.150
Because there's lots of metrics.

00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:02.020
And some of them
are characterized

00:47:02.020 --> 00:47:05.380
by only these three things,
and some are not, and--

00:47:05.380 --> 00:47:07.810
HONG LIU: You must
have an event horizon.

00:47:07.810 --> 00:47:09.750
AUDIENCE: Just the
presence of some horizon?

00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:10.080
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:10.805
So event horizon.

00:47:10.805 --> 00:47:11.979
Yeah.

00:47:11.979 --> 00:47:12.520
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:14.733
But in Rindler we
have an event horizon.

00:47:14.733 --> 00:47:15.316
HONG LIU: Hmm?

00:47:15.316 --> 00:47:17.482
AUDIENCE: In Rindler we
have an event horizon that's

00:47:17.482 --> 00:47:18.974
not a black hole [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:18.974 --> 00:47:19.890
HONG LIU: That's true.

00:47:22.412 --> 00:47:23.980
You should at least have object.

00:47:27.100 --> 00:47:29.340
You should have some mass.

00:47:29.340 --> 00:47:30.840
You should have
some quantum number.

00:47:30.840 --> 00:47:32.580
AUDIENCE: I could
be accelerating next

00:47:32.580 --> 00:47:34.210
to the [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:34.210 --> 00:47:37.310
HONG LIU: So, no,
no, no, no, no.

00:47:37.310 --> 00:47:40.030
Rindler is called
observer horizon.

00:47:40.030 --> 00:47:42.440
It's observer-dependent horizon.

00:47:42.440 --> 00:47:44.030
And in the black hole, it's not.

00:47:44.030 --> 00:47:46.404
AUDIENCE: So you cannot go to
any frame where there is no

00:47:46.404 --> 00:47:46.818
[INAUDIBLE].

00:47:46.818 --> 00:47:47.646
What if you are free-falling?

00:47:47.646 --> 00:47:48.100
HONG LIU: Hmm?

00:47:48.100 --> 00:47:49.724
AUDIENCE: What if
you are free-falling?

00:47:49.724 --> 00:47:51.612
HONG LIU: No no no.

00:47:51.612 --> 00:47:57.730
Yeah, what I'm just saying that
the-- here, here the horizon,

00:47:57.730 --> 00:48:01.560
you can-- different observers
have different horizons.

00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:05.940
AUDIENCE: So you can [INAUDIBLE]
the horizon out of the picture?

00:48:05.940 --> 00:48:08.600
HONG LIU: So here, the
horizon is arbitrary.

00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:10.420
It depends on your observer.

00:48:10.420 --> 00:48:16.810
Even though I draw here,
but-- this does not

00:48:16.810 --> 00:48:18.660
have to cross the origin.

00:48:18.660 --> 00:48:21.087
This can be anywhere.

00:48:21.087 --> 00:48:21.670
It's anywhere.

00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:25.654
Just here, there's no
[? generating ?] a horizon.

00:48:25.654 --> 00:48:27.820
AUDIENCE: But if I'm
free-falling into a black hole,

00:48:27.820 --> 00:48:29.589
I also don't have
a horizon, right?

00:48:29.589 --> 00:48:30.130
HONG LIU: No.

00:48:30.130 --> 00:48:31.340
AUDIENCE: Because I'm causally
connected [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:31.340 --> 00:48:33.460
HONG LIU: That's
true, but independent

00:48:33.460 --> 00:48:35.760
of that, there's the
spacetime structure,

00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:37.980
there's a horizon there.

00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:40.810
In the spacetime structure
of the Minkowski space,

00:48:40.810 --> 00:48:42.369
there's no horizon.

00:48:42.369 --> 00:48:44.160
In order to talk about
[INAUDIBLE] horizon,

00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:46.170
you have to talk about
specific observer

00:48:46.170 --> 00:48:48.035
to have specific motion.

00:48:51.110 --> 00:48:55.980
Yeah, I write down the
Schwarzschild metric.

00:48:55.980 --> 00:48:58.110
And the different
[INAUDIBLE] in the way.

00:48:58.110 --> 00:49:00.654
There is already
an event horizon.

00:49:00.654 --> 00:49:02.320
AUDIENCE: How do you
write down a metric

00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:03.839
in a [INAUDIBLE] invariant way?

00:49:03.839 --> 00:49:06.130
HONG LIU: No, I'm just saying
the motion of the horizon

00:49:06.130 --> 00:49:07.491
is a [INAUDIBLE] variant.

00:49:07.491 --> 00:49:08.032
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:49:08.032 --> 00:49:08.532
Yeah.

00:49:08.532 --> 00:49:11.990
But if I'm in a frame
that's free-falling,

00:49:11.990 --> 00:49:13.520
then I don't see
a horizon, right?

00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:16.302
Isn't that [INAUDIBLE] which
transported me to a frame

00:49:16.302 --> 00:49:19.290
where there is no horizon?

00:49:19.290 --> 00:49:21.545
HONG LIU: Maybe let me say this.

00:49:21.545 --> 00:49:24.330
If this can make you
a little bit happier.

00:49:24.330 --> 00:49:27.527
To a [? symptotic ?]
observer, there's a horizon.

00:49:27.527 --> 00:49:29.610
There's a different
[INAUDIBLE] invariant horizon.

00:49:29.610 --> 00:49:30.360
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:31.996
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:49:31.996 --> 00:49:33.594
Yeah, yeah.

00:49:33.594 --> 00:49:35.760
Yeah, if you don't want to
fall into the black hole,

00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:37.450
for those people,
there's a horizon.

00:49:37.450 --> 00:49:41.087
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:41.087 --> 00:49:43.670
And the difference from here,
if you fall through the horizon,

00:49:43.670 --> 00:49:44.336
nothing happens.

00:49:46.910 --> 00:49:51.370
So this no-hair
theorem is remarkable,

00:49:51.370 --> 00:49:58.880
because it says if you
have a star which collapsed

00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:02.720
to form a black hole,
in this process,

00:50:02.720 --> 00:50:05.710
all the features of
the star were lost.

00:50:05.710 --> 00:50:10.150
Because black hole only are
characterized by those numbers.

00:50:10.150 --> 00:50:10.746
OK?

00:50:10.746 --> 00:50:12.370
But star, you can
characterize in many,

00:50:12.370 --> 00:50:13.700
many other different ways.

00:50:13.700 --> 00:50:17.620
But the black hole, essentially,
don't have any features.

00:50:17.620 --> 00:50:19.080
So this is called
no-hair theorem.

00:50:21.824 --> 00:50:22.365
All features.

00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:41.423
Yes?

00:50:41.423 --> 00:50:43.395
AUDIENCE: What if
I add something

00:50:43.395 --> 00:50:47.339
like [INAUDIBLE] scalar field
or other field into that

00:50:47.339 --> 00:50:48.325
[INAUDIBLE].

00:50:48.325 --> 00:50:52.270
[INAUDIBLE] theorem?

00:50:52.270 --> 00:50:53.880
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:50:53.880 --> 00:50:54.380
Yeah.

00:50:54.380 --> 00:50:56.280
The story is a little
bit more complicated.

00:50:56.280 --> 00:50:59.019
Let's try to not go into that.

00:50:59.019 --> 00:51:01.060
There's something called
a secondary [INAUDIBLE],

00:51:01.060 --> 00:51:02.880
et cetera.

00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:04.632
Yeah.

00:51:04.632 --> 00:51:06.390
It can.

00:51:06.390 --> 00:51:08.990
It can, but this is
refers to Einstein.

00:51:08.990 --> 00:51:13.770
But if you go to the frame
of Einstein plus-- Einstein

00:51:13.770 --> 00:51:17.740
plus some meta-field, and then
this as a statement is true.

00:51:21.970 --> 00:51:22.810
Any other questions?

00:51:26.250 --> 00:51:28.470
OK.

00:51:28.470 --> 00:51:32.610
So now-- so
historically, of course,

00:51:32.610 --> 00:51:36.130
people did not discover
the temperature first.

00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:43.070
So historically, people first
have the no-hair theorem.

00:51:43.070 --> 00:51:45.900
So it seems like black hole
is completely featureless.

00:51:45.900 --> 00:51:47.000
OK?

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:52.770
It's a very boring object
that don't have any feature.

00:51:52.770 --> 00:51:54.910
And then, people discovered
the so-called four laws

00:51:54.910 --> 00:51:56.170
of black hole mechanics.

00:52:01.290 --> 00:52:04.520
For general black holes-- for
general stationary black holes,

00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:05.020
again.

00:52:08.270 --> 00:52:12.115
So the zeroth law-- again,
we just [? coat ?] them.

00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:16.595
[INAUDIBLE] is gravity.

00:52:20.690 --> 00:52:29.050
Kappa is constant
over the horizon.

00:52:39.390 --> 00:52:45.830
The first law is
that if you change

00:52:45.830 --> 00:52:48.535
the mass of the black
hole a little bit-- OK,

00:52:48.535 --> 00:52:51.076
imagine you put something, throw
something into a black hole,

00:52:51.076 --> 00:52:53.955
you change the mass of the
black hole a little bit,

00:52:53.955 --> 00:52:55.205
then you find such a relation.

00:53:02.130 --> 00:53:10.580
a is the area of the horizon

00:53:10.580 --> 00:53:12.050
So J is the angle of momentum.

00:53:12.050 --> 00:53:15.955
And omega is the angle of
where you can see the horizon.

00:53:15.955 --> 00:53:18.080
So if you have angle of
momentum on the black hole,

00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:18.955
we would be rotating.

00:53:20.662 --> 00:53:22.120
So omega is the
angle of frequency.

00:53:29.630 --> 00:53:34.900
And fie is the
electric potential.

00:53:34.900 --> 00:53:37.660
So if you have a charge,
than the back hole, all

00:53:37.660 --> 00:53:40.230
the current electric
fields, this

00:53:40.230 --> 00:53:44.625
is electric potential
at the horizon.

00:53:47.410 --> 00:53:50.470
And you always, in
this old notation,

00:53:50.470 --> 00:53:56.690
you normalize the electric
potential to infinity to be 0.

00:53:56.690 --> 00:53:58.330
So this is the first law.

00:53:58.330 --> 00:54:04.700
It just say if you change
mass of a black hole,

00:54:04.700 --> 00:54:06.410
and change some
angle of momentum

00:54:06.410 --> 00:54:09.170
and change some charge then
to the first order they

00:54:09.170 --> 00:54:12.010
satisfy this relation.

00:54:12.010 --> 00:54:13.960
They satisfy this relation.

00:54:13.960 --> 00:54:17.770
So this is just purely
mechanics, a classical of gr.

00:54:17.770 --> 00:54:19.245
This is pure, classical gr.

00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:29.170
And then there's a second law,
which is also classical gr,

00:54:29.170 --> 00:54:34.625
is that horizon area
never decreases.

00:54:46.380 --> 00:54:55.970
And the third law, says
the surface gravity--

00:54:55.970 --> 00:54:59.500
let me just call it kappa.

00:54:59.500 --> 00:55:08.840
This kappa surface gravity over
black hole cannot be reduced

00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:16.410
to 0 in the finite
number of steps.

00:55:26.924 --> 00:55:29.949
AUDIENCE: What do you
mean by number of steps?

00:55:29.949 --> 00:55:31.615
HONG LIU: Find the
number of procedures.

00:55:33.905 --> 00:55:34.530
AUDIENCE: Like?

00:55:37.640 --> 00:55:39.570
HONG LIU: Say if
each time you throw

00:55:39.570 --> 00:55:42.620
a particle to a black hole,
this is called a step.

00:55:42.620 --> 00:55:43.365
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:55:43.365 --> 00:55:43.865
OK.

00:55:43.865 --> 00:55:45.340
Thermometer, like [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:45.340 --> 00:55:46.390
HONG LIU: That's right.

00:55:46.390 --> 00:55:47.430
Yeah.

00:55:47.430 --> 00:55:48.410
This is called a step.

00:55:48.410 --> 00:55:48.620
Yeah.

00:55:48.620 --> 00:55:49.120
Right.

00:55:52.280 --> 00:55:52.780
OK.

00:55:52.780 --> 00:55:56.040
So all of these are
classical statement.

00:55:56.040 --> 00:55:59.335
And so this tells
the second law.

00:55:59.335 --> 00:56:01.760
For example, if you throw
something to a black hole,

00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:03.830
the black area will increase.

00:56:03.830 --> 00:56:07.180
So if you collide
the two black holes,

00:56:07.180 --> 00:56:09.710
and then if you collide
two black holes,

00:56:09.710 --> 00:56:11.990
they will merge into
a bigger black hole.

00:56:11.990 --> 00:56:13.830
And this bigger
black hole, the area

00:56:13.830 --> 00:56:20.850
will be larger than the sum of
the area of two black holes--

00:56:20.850 --> 00:56:24.170
than the area of
two black holes.

00:56:24.170 --> 00:56:26.500
Yeah.

00:56:26.500 --> 00:56:35.650
So of course this law
just-- these four laws

00:56:35.650 --> 00:56:39.320
then become immediately
just like the four laws

00:56:39.320 --> 00:56:41.470
of thermodynamics.

00:56:41.470 --> 00:56:45.280
You make this
identification of one.

00:56:45.280 --> 00:57:02.980
This identification of
one-- so if it's one,

00:57:02.980 --> 00:57:07.870
this just becomes the four
laws of thermodynamics.

00:57:15.520 --> 00:57:16.020
Yeah.

00:57:16.020 --> 00:57:16.645
Thermodynamics.

00:57:25.380 --> 00:57:27.680
The four laws of thermodynamics.

00:57:27.680 --> 00:57:36.790
In particular, the first law, if
you substitute the copper and A

00:57:36.790 --> 00:57:40.610
by the temperature under
the entropy, than this just

00:57:40.610 --> 00:57:47.620
becomes the standard, the
first law, in particular.

00:57:47.620 --> 00:57:58.470
The first law, it's just
dm, sdt, tds plus omega

00:57:58.470 --> 00:58:02.768
dj plus 5 dq.

00:58:02.768 --> 00:58:06.450
So this is really the first
law of thermodynamics.

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:20.830
So historically, these
four laws of mechanics

00:58:20.830 --> 00:58:25.680
actually was discovered
before Hawkings radiation.

00:58:25.680 --> 00:58:29.640
So first they discovered
this black hole law theorem.

00:58:29.640 --> 00:58:31.470
And then they discovered
these four laws

00:58:31.470 --> 00:58:34.160
of black hole mechanics.

00:58:34.160 --> 00:58:35.690
Then they say,
ah, this is really

00:58:35.690 --> 00:58:38.500
look like thermodynamics.

00:58:38.500 --> 00:58:40.630
And they even patterned
these four laws

00:58:40.630 --> 00:58:44.750
to precisely like the four
laws of thermodynamics.

00:58:44.750 --> 00:58:47.710
But they could not
imagine the black hole

00:58:47.710 --> 00:58:50.860
was a thermodynamic object.

00:58:50.860 --> 00:58:55.400
They could not imagine the black
hole was thermodynamic object.

00:58:55.400 --> 00:58:58.290
So they were saying, if you
look at the old paper-- there

00:58:58.290 --> 00:59:02.430
was a very famous paper by
Bardeen, Carter, and Hawking,

00:59:02.430 --> 00:59:07.120
which discuss these four
laws of black hole mechanics.

00:59:07.120 --> 00:59:10.820
And they said, this four
laws of black hole mechanics

00:59:10.820 --> 00:59:14.534
should actually transcend the
standard of thermodynamics.

00:59:14.534 --> 00:59:16.200
The black hole actually
should transcend

00:59:16.200 --> 00:59:18.288
all of these, our
traditional physics.

00:59:22.670 --> 00:59:30.250
But in 1971 or 1972, a
young graduate student

00:59:30.250 --> 00:59:36.780
called Bekenstein, so he was a
graduate student at Princeton.

00:59:36.780 --> 00:59:40.270
So he was studying
under a guy called

00:59:40.270 --> 00:59:44.490
Wheeler, studied under Wheeler.

00:59:44.490 --> 00:59:51.070
And so he was very
uncomfortable with the fact

00:59:51.070 --> 00:59:54.830
that if you throw something
into a black hole,

00:59:54.830 --> 00:59:57.540
than that thing is gone.

00:59:57.540 --> 00:59:59.620
So he was a very
uncomfortable with that.

00:59:59.620 --> 01:00:02.520
Because if you throw something
to a black hole, it's gone,

01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:06.920
then he concluded that's
really the second law

01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:08.780
of thermodynamics.

01:00:08.780 --> 01:00:12.530
Because if you throw to a
black hole, that thing is gone,

01:00:12.530 --> 01:00:14.950
then the entropy associated
with that thing is gone.

01:00:14.950 --> 01:00:16.533
And the black hole
is just black hole,

01:00:16.533 --> 01:00:18.270
have this no-hair theorem.

01:00:18.270 --> 01:00:21.015
And then you violate the
second law of thermodynamics.

01:00:24.310 --> 01:00:27.960
People like Wheeler or Hawking,
they say, ah, this is great.

01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:31.470
Black hole transcend
the thermodynamics.

01:00:31.470 --> 01:00:33.320
But Bekenstein
was uncomfortable.

01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:35.600
He thinks thermodynamics
should transcend black hole.

01:00:39.070 --> 01:00:43.370
And then based on the second
law of the black hole,

01:00:43.370 --> 01:00:53.760
then he said, so maybe--
so he wrote a series

01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:55.560
of papers, a few papers.

01:00:55.560 --> 01:00:57.200
I don't remember.

01:00:57.200 --> 01:01:01.530
He say, if we think black
hole has entropy proportional

01:01:01.530 --> 01:01:08.601
to the area, then the second law
of thermodynamics can be saved.

01:01:08.601 --> 01:01:11.749
Because this area
of level decrease,

01:01:11.749 --> 01:01:13.540
and if you throw
something to a black hole,

01:01:13.540 --> 01:01:16.870
even thought that, the entropy
associated to that guy's lost.

01:01:16.870 --> 01:01:19.010
But that area also increased.

01:01:19.010 --> 01:01:20.460
The area also increased.

01:01:20.460 --> 01:01:23.090
And then you can say it's the
second law of thermodynamics.

01:01:23.090 --> 01:01:25.540
Now, he actually proposed
to generalize the second law

01:01:25.540 --> 01:01:26.290
of thermodynamics.

01:01:32.030 --> 01:01:34.370
So he proposed a
generalized second law.

01:01:34.370 --> 01:01:36.070
He said, you take
the total, if you

01:01:36.070 --> 01:01:38.190
take the total
entropy of the system

01:01:38.190 --> 01:01:41.090
to be that of the black
hole, and then matter

01:01:41.090 --> 01:01:46.440
field outside the black
hole, then this ds total

01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:48.796
must be non-decreasing.

01:01:53.520 --> 01:02:01.860
Of course, now if we accept,
if we take this leap of faith

01:02:01.860 --> 01:02:05.530
to really think black hole as
a sum or object, then of course

01:02:05.530 --> 01:02:07.350
this generalized
second law has to be

01:02:07.350 --> 01:02:09.555
true because the
thermodymaics-- some object.

01:02:12.190 --> 01:02:14.650
But when Bekenstein
proposed it, it

01:02:14.650 --> 01:02:23.460
was really bizarre
to say in a nice way

01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:28.140
because it just sounded
crazy, just outright crazy.

01:02:28.140 --> 01:02:32.720
Because how can black
hole have entropy?

01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:34.350
Black hole absorb everything.

01:02:34.350 --> 01:02:36.080
Just how can it have entropy?

01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:40.510
And it just completely
was disregarded by people.

01:02:40.510 --> 01:02:42.670
And it was discarded by people.

01:02:42.670 --> 01:02:46.610
And anyway, but then
now that he was right,

01:02:46.610 --> 01:02:49.950
then of course after Hawking's
discovery of a Hawking

01:02:49.950 --> 01:02:54.050
radiation, they become very
natural for the black hole

01:02:54.050 --> 01:02:55.880
to have entropy.

01:02:55.880 --> 01:03:03.700
And in particular, this
formula, after you determine

01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:07.140
that the black hold have
this temperature, after you

01:03:07.140 --> 01:03:10.895
fix this pre-factor,
then you can

01:03:10.895 --> 01:03:16.320
also, just from the first law,
just from here, just from here,

01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:19.250
to fix that pre-factor
of a black hole.

01:03:19.250 --> 01:03:20.800
So Bekenstein could
not decide what's

01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:24.190
the proportional constant.

01:03:24.190 --> 01:03:26.010
But once you get
the temperature,

01:03:26.010 --> 01:03:27.940
then this proportional
constant just uniquely

01:03:27.940 --> 01:03:33.820
fixed from this equation,
so without using that.

01:03:33.820 --> 01:03:36.270
Just using the first
law of mechanics,

01:03:36.270 --> 01:03:41.090
then you can immediately
integrate that as entropy.

01:03:41.090 --> 01:03:41.770
Anyway--

01:03:41.770 --> 01:03:43.228
AUDIENCE: How did
Bekenstein find--

01:03:46.465 --> 01:03:47.590
HONG LIU: It's a postulate.

01:03:47.590 --> 01:03:49.470
It's a gas.

01:03:49.470 --> 01:03:49.970
Yeah.

01:03:49.970 --> 01:03:53.640
He just postulate,
if we imagine--

01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:56.780
AUDIENCE: He didn't derive it?

01:03:56.780 --> 01:03:59.405
HONG LIU: No there's
no way to derive it.

01:03:59.405 --> 01:04:01.880
He was just saying,
if you imagine

01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:04.940
black hole has entropy
proportion to the area,

01:04:04.940 --> 01:04:07.750
than the second law of
thermodynamics can be saved.

01:04:07.750 --> 01:04:10.020
And he wants to save the
second law of thermodynamics.

01:04:10.020 --> 01:04:10.757
Yes.

01:04:10.757 --> 01:04:11.840
AUDIENCE: So one question.

01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:13.660
So this makes sense classically.

01:04:13.660 --> 01:04:16.860
If I have a system of entropy,
I throw them to a black hole.

01:04:16.860 --> 01:04:17.963
Entropy is like ignorance.

01:04:17.963 --> 01:04:20.140
If I throw ignorance
into the black hole,

01:04:20.140 --> 01:04:22.060
maybe there's somehow
the black hole

01:04:22.060 --> 01:04:24.032
also becomes more
ignorant or something.

01:04:24.032 --> 01:04:26.240
But what does this mean in
terms of quantum mechanics

01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:28.360
when I have a pure state?

01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:30.570
From quantum
statistical mechanics,

01:04:30.570 --> 01:04:33.520
substance the entropy, you
just don't know something

01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:34.440
about your state.

01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:35.860
And it's your
fault. And it's not

01:04:35.860 --> 01:04:38.006
like the black hole should
car if it's your fault

01:04:38.006 --> 01:04:38.839
or not or something.

01:04:38.839 --> 01:04:41.560
So why does this makes
sense quantum mechanically?

01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:43.100
Maybe it doesn't.

01:04:43.100 --> 01:04:46.310
HONG LIU: You mean, why does
black law have entropy make

01:04:46.310 --> 01:04:47.617
sense quantum mechanically?

01:04:47.617 --> 01:04:48.200
AUDIENCE: Yes.

01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:55.200
HONG LIU: It's the same thing
as-- this room has entropy.

01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:57.710
This room we use quantum
statistical physics.

01:04:57.710 --> 01:05:01.530
If you believe black hole is
an ordinary object, then--

01:05:01.530 --> 01:05:03.530
AUDIENCE: We only quantum
statistical physics

01:05:03.530 --> 01:05:06.250
because we're ignorant,
the full state of--

01:05:09.050 --> 01:05:09.710
HONG LIU: Yeah.

01:05:09.710 --> 01:05:12.180
For a black hole, we
are also ignorant.

01:05:12.180 --> 01:05:12.715
Yeah.

01:05:12.715 --> 01:05:16.351
This is actually something
I'm going to talk about now.

01:05:16.351 --> 01:05:17.730
Any other questions?

01:05:17.730 --> 01:05:21.670
AUDIENCE: I have
something [INAUDIBLE].

01:05:21.670 --> 01:05:26.016
So basically, I think it can
be [? a healing ?] experiment.

01:05:26.016 --> 01:05:29.408
So where we hear
things of [INAUDIBLE].

01:05:29.408 --> 01:05:33.340
There is one unit of entropy,
and it enters black hole.

01:05:33.340 --> 01:05:36.650
It increased the energy
of black hole, which

01:05:36.650 --> 01:05:39.040
increased the mass
of black hole, which

01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:40.952
increased the [INAUDIBLE]
of the black hole.

01:05:40.952 --> 01:05:45.870
So in this way you can actually
derive the semi-qualitatively

01:05:45.870 --> 01:05:50.140
derived out of proportionality.

01:05:50.140 --> 01:05:51.290
HONG LIU: Yeah.

01:05:51.290 --> 01:05:54.854
To derive with these precise
[? cohortions-- ?] no,

01:05:54.854 --> 01:05:56.770
I don't think they derive
the [? cohortion ?],

01:05:56.770 --> 01:05:58.150
but I need to check.

01:05:58.150 --> 01:05:59.950
I don't think there's
any way to derive

01:05:59.950 --> 01:06:06.439
the-- you can, say, put some
bond on the [? cohortions ?].

01:06:06.439 --> 01:06:08.230
But you cannot derive
the [? cohortions ?].

01:06:08.230 --> 01:06:10.880
I think that argument
would not enable you

01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:12.980
to derive the [? cohortions. ?]

01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:22.880
Anyway, so let me just
mention a few more things

01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:24.010
about black hole.

01:06:24.010 --> 01:06:32.660
This is just pure-- actually,
I'm running out of time.

01:06:32.660 --> 01:06:46.400
So let me just mention
some paradox or paradoxes

01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:47.390
for the black hole.

01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:52.948
So we have shown that the
black hole is some object.

01:06:56.230 --> 01:06:59.830
So Jordan just asked.

01:06:59.830 --> 01:07:04.480
But we know the ordinary
thermodynamics has

01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:07.790
statistical physics behind it.

01:07:07.790 --> 01:07:09.920
So the immediate
question is actually,

01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:17.044
does the black hole
entropy, for example,

01:07:17.044 --> 01:07:18.460
have a statistical
interpretation?

01:07:31.750 --> 01:07:34.440
So this is one question.

01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:38.970
And another question is that,
does black hole actually

01:07:38.970 --> 01:07:40.515
respect quantum mechanics?

01:07:48.540 --> 01:07:52.750
Does black hole respect
quantum mechanics?

01:07:52.750 --> 01:07:59.130
So if black hole entropy have
a statistical interpretation,

01:07:59.130 --> 01:08:06.447
then this give you a
very-- so it black hole

01:08:06.447 --> 01:08:08.030
have a statistical
interpretation that

01:08:08.030 --> 01:08:22.370
means-- so A, if
affirmative, that

01:08:22.370 --> 01:08:31.569
implies that each black
hole, even though black hole

01:08:31.569 --> 01:08:34.670
at a macroscopic level only is
characterized by these three

01:08:34.670 --> 01:08:54.685
things, But macroscopically,
must have internal states.

01:09:01.910 --> 01:09:12.840
Or, maybe I should call
it macrostate of order

01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:19.260
to the entropy, which is
the A of the black hole area

01:09:19.260 --> 01:09:19.985
4h bar e.

01:09:29.990 --> 01:09:31.939
So hidden behind
this no-hair theorem

01:09:31.939 --> 01:09:33.829
is actually a huge
number of macrostates.

01:09:37.330 --> 01:09:41.779
Just like the air
in this room, even

01:09:41.779 --> 01:09:44.770
though we describe the
unit temperature, pressure,

01:09:44.770 --> 01:09:49.270
and the energy stature, but
given that macroscopic data,

01:09:49.270 --> 01:09:53.370
they can be huge
number of macro states.

01:09:53.370 --> 01:09:56.960
And then a similar thing should
happen to the black hole.

01:09:56.960 --> 01:10:00.800
And in order to see that
the black hole does have,

01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:02.770
a statistical
interpretation, then you

01:10:02.770 --> 01:10:07.150
have to find so many states
for a black hole and in order

01:10:07.150 --> 01:10:16.640
to answer the question
A. So this question

01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:20.230
has to be answered
in the affirmative

01:10:20.230 --> 01:10:24.100
for many different
type of black holes.

01:10:24.100 --> 01:10:27.725
Say in string theory and
also [INAUDIBLE] spacetime,

01:10:27.725 --> 01:10:30.330
and they see the spacetime.

01:10:30.330 --> 01:10:34.070
Using string theory method or
using this holographic duality,

01:10:34.070 --> 01:10:40.120
we will see examples later.

01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:42.660
We will see examples later.

01:10:42.660 --> 01:10:46.790
So these really confirms
that the black hole is really

01:10:46.790 --> 01:10:49.570
a quantum statistical system.

01:10:52.140 --> 01:11:02.360
So regarding this question B,
then this long time paradox--

01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:07.350
so this A has also been
a paradox for many years,

01:11:07.350 --> 01:11:18.430
and was only resolved--
the basic calculations were

01:11:18.430 --> 01:11:25.170
able to do only in 1996,
when the [INAUDIBLE],

01:11:25.170 --> 01:11:28.040
they did some very special
[? Schwarzschild ?]

01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:32.470
black hole, which they counted
this exact number of states.

01:11:32.470 --> 01:11:35.760
They counted the exact,
this number of states,

01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:40.230
and about for a very
specific type of black hole.

01:11:40.230 --> 01:11:54.907
So B is rated to the so-called
Hawkins information paradox,

01:11:54.907 --> 01:11:55.948
information loss paradox.

01:11:59.692 --> 01:12:02.100
So I will not have time
to go into detail here.

01:12:02.100 --> 01:12:04.620
Let me just give you a
very rough version of it.

01:12:08.990 --> 01:12:11.190
So you can see the
pure state, could see

01:12:11.190 --> 01:12:17.240
the star, a big star
in the pure state.

01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:21.120
So we know from gr that a
sufficiently massive star

01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:25.610
will eventually always
collapse to form a black hole.

01:12:25.610 --> 01:12:29.900
So if we imagine you have a pure
star in the pure state collapse

01:12:29.900 --> 01:12:35.880
to form a black hole, and if
quantum mechanics is preserved

01:12:35.880 --> 01:12:39.330
throughout the process,
then this black hole

01:12:39.330 --> 01:12:41.360
should also be a pure state.

01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:43.280
So that means the
black hole should

01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:49.210
be just one of all those max
number of possible states.

01:12:49.210 --> 01:12:51.370
There should be a pure
state, but only one

01:12:51.370 --> 01:12:55.080
of those all possible states.

01:12:55.080 --> 01:13:00.780
But then Hawkins had an argument
saying this is impossible.

01:13:00.780 --> 01:13:04.840
Because if black hole is
a pure state, then when

01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:08.720
black hole evaporates-- so
the black hole evaporates,

01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:11.240
eventually the black
hole will be gone.

01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:14.200
So the one funny
thing about black hole

01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:17.560
is that the temperature
is inverse proportionate

01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:19.370
to the mass.

01:13:19.370 --> 01:13:23.630
So when the black hole is big,
then the temperature is low,

01:13:23.630 --> 01:13:26.200
then the radiation is small.

01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:28.980
But when you start radiate,
then the black hole mass

01:13:28.980 --> 01:13:30.440
will decrease.

01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:33.450
And then the temperature will
be higher than we radiate mole.

01:13:33.450 --> 01:13:36.170
So it will be
acceleration process.

01:13:36.170 --> 01:13:42.220
And eventually-- presumably
black hole will be gone.

01:13:44.990 --> 01:13:47.650
So this kind of semi-classical
argument that we are given

01:13:47.650 --> 01:13:49.870
applies only for a
massive black hole

01:13:49.870 --> 01:13:54.480
much greater than the planck
mass, only much larger

01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:56.380
than a planck mass.

01:13:56.380 --> 01:13:59.020
So below planck
mass, what happens?

01:13:59.020 --> 01:14:00.400
Nobody knows.

01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:04.220
But at least this
radiation statement

01:14:04.220 --> 01:14:06.390
should be robust for the
mass much, much larger

01:14:06.390 --> 01:14:08.500
than the planck mass.

01:14:08.500 --> 01:14:10.770
Now Hawking then say
this is a paradox

01:14:10.770 --> 01:14:16.090
because according
to his calculation,

01:14:16.090 --> 01:14:18.319
the radiation is simple.

01:14:18.319 --> 01:14:19.860
And we know that
the sum of radiation

01:14:19.860 --> 01:14:22.200
does not contain
any information.

01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:24.880
It cannot contain information
but it's pure state,

01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:29.130
because sum or radiation
is information free.

01:14:29.130 --> 01:14:32.110
And so the sum of
radiation which come out,

01:14:32.110 --> 01:14:36.862
come out until you reach say
the mass of all the planck mass.

01:14:41.110 --> 01:14:45.880
And here we reach
the planck mass.

01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:50.770
And then before you reach that
mass, because the radiation is

01:14:50.770 --> 01:14:54.240
simple, there can be no
information can come out.

01:14:56.960 --> 01:14:59.860
And when you reach
that planck mass,

01:14:59.860 --> 01:15:03.430
it just becoming possible
for such a huge amount

01:15:03.430 --> 01:15:09.580
of internal state to be encoded
in the planck mass object.

01:15:09.580 --> 01:15:13.340
So he concluded that the
information must be lost,

01:15:13.340 --> 01:15:17.550
and the black hole
must violate mechanics.

01:15:17.550 --> 01:15:21.210
So this is a very
heuristic argument.

01:15:21.210 --> 01:15:23.060
But I highly suggest,
if you are interested,

01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:27.680
to go read his original paper,
which is very beautiful.

01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:30.200
Because he was really trying
to think of black hole

01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:33.070
as a ordinary quantum
mechanical object.

01:15:33.070 --> 01:15:37.590
And the way he was thinking
about it is really very nice.

01:15:37.590 --> 01:15:41.880
And actually, it's
not very different

01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:44.010
from we are thinking
about black hole

01:15:44.010 --> 01:15:47.414
right now, from the
holographic duality.

01:15:47.414 --> 01:15:48.830
He was really
thinking that's it's

01:15:48.830 --> 01:15:50.500
a quantum mechanical object.

01:15:50.500 --> 01:15:54.150
But then he reached
this paradox.

01:15:54.150 --> 01:15:58.960
Anyway, so this paradox
had bothered the people

01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:01.860
for more than 30 years.

01:16:01.860 --> 01:16:05.820
So he discovered the
Hawking radiation in 1974.

01:16:05.820 --> 01:16:09.270
I think he proposed
this paradox in 1976.

01:16:09.270 --> 01:16:14.500
So for more than
30 years, people

01:16:14.500 --> 01:16:18.680
argue with each other
what is going to happen.

01:16:18.680 --> 01:16:22.410
It's typically divided
into two camps.

01:16:22.410 --> 01:16:26.040
So the gr people, they think
black hole is everything,

01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:28.390
quantum mechanics nothing.

01:16:28.390 --> 01:16:32.060
And the black hole must be able
to violate quantum mechanics

01:16:32.060 --> 01:16:38.440
and will bring us to a new
frontier we never see before.

01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:40.630
And the particle, these
people are saying,

01:16:40.630 --> 01:16:46.020
a black hole-- oh, we can even
creating the accelerator--

01:16:46.020 --> 01:16:51.340
must obey quantum mechanics.

01:16:51.340 --> 01:16:53.890
So people would just
argue with each other

01:16:53.890 --> 01:16:57.150
and without really setting
the question in a very

01:16:57.150 --> 01:17:00.810
convincing way to either camp.

01:17:00.810 --> 01:17:06.940
But this holographic
duality, in the context

01:17:06.940 --> 01:17:09.470
of holographic duality, then
the black hole [INAUDIBLE]

01:17:09.470 --> 01:17:13.450
spacetime, then you
can actually rephrase

01:17:13.450 --> 01:17:16.290
this question about the
black hole information laws.

01:17:16.290 --> 01:17:19.090
And the holographic
duality strongly

01:17:19.090 --> 01:17:21.840
suggests-- I think it's
maybe not really completely

01:17:21.840 --> 01:17:25.340
proved-- strongly suggests at
least that the black hole is

01:17:25.340 --> 01:17:27.460
just a ordinary quantum
mechanical object.

01:17:31.500 --> 01:17:35.210
We are not transcend
the quantum mechanics.

01:17:35.210 --> 01:17:39.041
We are not transcend
the quantum mechanics.

01:17:39.041 --> 01:17:39.540
Yeah.

01:17:39.540 --> 01:17:41.840
I am really out of time.

01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:42.650
Yes?

01:17:42.650 --> 01:17:45.980
AUDIENCE: So you said the
star is in a pure state.

01:17:45.980 --> 01:17:49.220
But how can that be,
because it has a temperature

01:17:49.220 --> 01:17:50.992
and it's also thermal system?

01:17:50.992 --> 01:17:52.770
So how can you put
it in a pure state?

01:17:52.770 --> 01:17:53.311
HONG LIU: No.

01:17:53.311 --> 01:17:56.508
Black hole does not have
to be in the thermal state.

01:17:56.508 --> 01:17:57.340
No.

01:17:57.340 --> 01:18:01.710
I can certainly imagine a star,
which is in the pure state.

01:18:01.710 --> 01:18:05.350
In real life, maybe it's
hard to construct them.

01:18:05.350 --> 01:18:07.286
But on the paper, I can do it.

01:18:07.286 --> 01:18:11.660
[LAUGHTER]

01:18:11.660 --> 01:18:16.700
In principle, so how
many atoms in the star?

01:18:16.700 --> 01:18:17.840
I don't know.

01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:18.630
Maybe 10 to 100?

01:18:18.630 --> 01:18:20.880
Now let's imagine there's
10 to the 100 atoms.

01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:23.302
AUDIENCE: But it's radiating
all the time though.

01:18:23.302 --> 01:18:25.790
Doesn't it entangle with
things and make it not pure?

01:18:25.790 --> 01:18:26.790
HONG LIU: Don't worry.

01:18:26.790 --> 01:18:28.870
Don't worry.

01:18:28.870 --> 01:18:31.280
I can certainly write down
a wave function for 10

01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:35.350
to the 100 particles,
which is in the pure state.

01:18:35.350 --> 01:18:37.870
And this will be a big object.

01:18:37.870 --> 01:18:40.490
And according to the
rule of gr, this thing

01:18:40.490 --> 01:18:42.340
will collapse to
form a black hole.

01:18:42.340 --> 01:18:43.596
AUDIENCE: What about the
light that it's emitting,

01:18:43.596 --> 01:18:44.310
which it has--

01:18:44.310 --> 01:18:44.851
HONG LIU: No.

01:18:44.851 --> 01:18:45.570
There's no light.

01:18:45.570 --> 01:18:46.070
No.

01:18:46.070 --> 01:18:48.035
We work with zero
temperature, just pure state.

01:18:48.035 --> 01:18:49.600
There's nothing.

01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:50.531
There's nothing.

01:18:50.531 --> 01:18:51.572
AUDIENCE: No temperature?

01:18:51.572 --> 01:18:52.520
Zero temperature?

01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:53.490
HONG LIU: Yeah.

01:18:53.490 --> 01:18:57.400
In principle, I can do that.

01:18:57.400 --> 01:18:59.528
AUDIENCE: In that case,
will the black hole

01:18:59.528 --> 01:19:02.455
have the temperature,
Hawking temperature?

01:19:02.455 --> 01:19:03.080
HONG LIU: Yeah.

01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:05.100
The black hole will have
Hawking temperature.

01:19:05.100 --> 01:19:08.700
AUDIENCE: But it's still
in it's first state?

01:19:08.700 --> 01:19:11.360
HONG LIU: The black hole will
have a Hawking temperature,

01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:13.600
will have-- similar,
have entropy,

01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:15.640
but will be a pure state.

01:19:15.640 --> 01:19:19.960
So this is the essence of
the information paradox.

01:19:19.960 --> 01:19:22.240
So this is the essence of
the information paradox.

01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:24.420
And then we will be
able to explain it,

01:19:24.420 --> 01:19:28.117
why this is so, using
the holographic duality.

01:19:28.117 --> 01:19:29.700
AUDIENCE: So as the
star collapses, it

01:19:29.700 --> 01:19:31.157
gains a non-zero temperature.

01:19:31.157 --> 01:19:33.740
It starts at zero temperature,
and then collapses, and becomes

01:19:33.740 --> 01:19:34.190
[INAUDIBLE].

01:19:34.190 --> 01:19:34.470
HONG LIU: Yeah.

01:19:34.470 --> 01:19:34.602
It can.

01:19:34.602 --> 01:19:35.420
Yeah.

01:19:35.420 --> 01:19:39.780
It seemingly have a
long zero temperature.

01:19:39.780 --> 01:19:41.680
Yeah.

01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:42.180
Yeah.

01:19:42.180 --> 01:19:44.202
Maybe let's stop here.
