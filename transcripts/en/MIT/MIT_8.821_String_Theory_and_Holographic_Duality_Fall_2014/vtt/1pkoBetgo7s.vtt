00:00:21.715 --> 00:00:22.340
HONG LIU: Good.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.510
So before we start, do
you have any questions

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.490
on what we did before?

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:33.430
OK.

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:39.600
So we have discussed
that a black hole can be

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.250
considered as a similar object.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.911
And that, actually, black
holes obey the standard law

00:00:47.911 --> 00:00:48.660
of thermodynamics.

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:59.260
And now we also mentioned
that it's a natural question

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.530
to ask whether the
black hole should we

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.200
be considered as an ordinary
quantum mechanical object.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.020
And so this is related to the
issue of information paradox.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.790
So by this regard, this
information paradox,

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:21.560
which I think now has a
very good-- in principle

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.950
has a reasonable resolution,
which we will talk about later.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.770
But if we do treat the black
hole as an ordinary quantum

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:36.080
mechanical object,
then they actually

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.055
are very important implications.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.115
So one implication is called
the holographic principle.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.290
So, the holographic principle
by itself is, in some sense,

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:11.280
a rather heuristic
concept at the moment.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:19.450
And I will also only give you
a very heuristic discussion.

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.830
And it's possible to make it
a little bit more rigorous.

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:27.370
But we will do it a
rather heuristic level,

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.340
just to give you a
feeling that there

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:38.410
is something profound going
on in quantum gravity because

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:39.490
of black holes.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:03:03.960
So let's consider an
isolated system of mass.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:17.900
Say E and, say,
entropy as zero, say

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.340
in asymptotic flat spacetime.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:47.600
And then we also denote A
as the area of the smallest

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:59.045
sphere that closes the system.

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:13.745
And also let me
introduce-- let MA

00:04:13.745 --> 00:04:27.350
be the mass of the black hole,
of the same horizon area.

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.330
Yes.

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:42.415
Black hole with
horizon area A. OK?

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:53.490
So in GR, anything which
is sufficiently massive

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.980
will eventually collapse
to form a black hole.

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:10.720
Because of that-- so we must
have E is smaller than MA,

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.230
So we must have E--
so whatever energy

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:16.790
you can put in this
region surrounded by area

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:22.850
A must be smaller than
the mass of a black hole

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:24.840
which you can put
in that region.

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:25.340
OK?

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:30.750
Because otherwise,
if we have more mass,

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:34.215
then it will already
be a black hole.

00:05:34.215 --> 00:05:35.549
AUDIENCE: Should that be equal?

00:05:35.549 --> 00:05:36.090
HONG LIU: Hm?

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:36.946
AUDIENCE: Should it be equal?

00:05:36.946 --> 00:05:37.760
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:38.380
Say equal.

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.670
So now let's suppose
E is smaller than MA.

00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:04.100
So we can now-- so suppose
E is smaller than MA

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:09.720
and now we can add
this amount of energy,

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:21.840
say MA minus E amount of
energy, to the system.

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:30.700
OK.

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:32.395
Suppose we can do
that and keep A fixed.

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:42.490
Suppose we can do
that and keep A fixed.

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:45.140
And then this will
reach a black hole mass.

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:59.410
Then the final system
will have a black hole,

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:01.790
will have the
energy given by MA.

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:13.380
And that object
must be a black hole

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:15.755
because that's the black hole
with the same horizon area.

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:26.740
Because this process
also tells you

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:32.050
that the black hole entropy
must be greater than the S0,

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:37.650
the initial entropy of this
system, plus the S prime-- S

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:39.635
prime is the entropy
of added energy.

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:49.690
OK.

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:52.290
So just because of the
second law of thermodynamics,

00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:55.450
your entropy should
not decrease.

00:07:55.450 --> 00:08:02.376
So the final-- so you add this
amount of energy so to MA,

00:08:02.376 --> 00:08:07.630
so then you will precisely form
a black hole over the mass MA,

00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:11.450
and with the horizon area A.
But this black hole entropy

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:15.550
should be greater than its
zero plus the entropy you

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:17.550
added from the second
law of thermodynamics.

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:29.090
So then that means your
initial entropy must be smaller

00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:31.650
than the black hole entropy.

00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:41.020
Must be smaller than A
divided by 4 h bar G newton.

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:59.630
So this argument tells you
that the maximal entropy

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:16.360
inside a region bounded
by area A is given by--

00:09:28.615 --> 00:09:29.115
OK.

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:33.780
Yes?

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:37.210
AUDIENCE: So will keeping
A fixed add entropy

00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:38.680
to the system?

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:40.038
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:09:40.038 --> 00:09:44.299
AUDIENCE: So in that case,
why don't we have such a term?

00:09:44.299 --> 00:09:44.965
HONG LIU: Sorry?

00:09:44.965 --> 00:09:47.760
AUDIENCE: So you said
we want to keep A fixed.

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:48.343
HONG LIU: Yes.

00:09:48.343 --> 00:09:50.760
AUDIENCE: Will that add
extra entropy to the system?

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:52.450
HONG LIU: Yes.

00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:56.370
AUDIENCE: So according to the
second law of thermodynamics,

00:09:56.370 --> 00:10:00.630
why will we claim that
the entropy of the hole

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:05.000
is greater than or
equal than S0 plus S--

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.144
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:10:06.144 --> 00:10:06.685
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:10:06.685 --> 00:10:07.185
OK.

00:10:07.185 --> 00:10:08.370
It's add the energy.

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:08.600
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:09.350
Because it-- Yeah.

00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:11.356
This is the energy
of added energy.

00:10:11.356 --> 00:10:14.670
AUDIENCE: How about
the extra energy

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:17.840
that might be introduced
by keeping A fixed?

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:18.915
Because it's not--

00:10:18.915 --> 00:10:19.540
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:20.720
Whatever it is.

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:21.670
Whatever it is.

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:24.300
Suppose you can keep A fixed.

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:25.930
Suppose you can keep A fixed.

00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:29.680
Then whatever things
you added to that--

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:33.070
that total entropy-- must be
smaller than the [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:34.780
because black hole
is the final state.

00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:40.036
AUDIENCE: You said it's an
isolated system, so with that,

00:10:40.036 --> 00:10:42.210
how can you make
sure that A is fixed?

00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:43.190
HONG LIU: Hm?

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:44.760
AUDIENCE: Why is an
isolated system--

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:45.255
HONG LIU: Oh.

00:10:45.255 --> 00:10:45.755
Yeah.

00:10:45.755 --> 00:10:48.010
I'm just saying, we are
doing a thought experiment.

00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:52.130
Imagine you can do this
by keeping A fixed.

00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:58.600
Yeah, just say you just put
stuff in into this region.

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:04.320
So that stuff does not come out.

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:08.790
Yeah, you just have some
region A. Let me do it here.

00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:16.570
You have some region A. And
there is a mass inside here.

00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:18.330
There's some energy
stuff inside here.

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:23.980
So this is region A. And then
you just keep putting stuff in.

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:26.690
Just keep putting stuff
in so that those things

00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:29.990
don't come out A-- don't
come out of this region.

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:32.830
That's what this means.

00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:35.670
AUDIENCE: Then A is not
the smallest sphere?

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:36.590
HONG LIU: Hm?

00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:40.730
AUDIENCE: Then A is not
the smallest sphere?

00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:41.640
HONG LIU: A is what?

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:43.690
AUDIENCE: Not the
smallest sphere

00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:45.485
that can enclose the system.

00:11:45.485 --> 00:11:47.010
So it's not--

00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:47.640
HONG LIU: No.

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:50.370
A is not the smallest
sphere in the system.

00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:56.750
A is just-- maybe I
should call this-- A is

00:11:56.750 --> 00:12:01.164
the area of a sphere.

00:12:01.164 --> 00:12:02.640
Yeah.

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:03.880
Sorry.

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:04.800
Yeah.

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:06.520
Thanks.

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:11.820
So just enough A to be a sphere
that encloses the system.

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:12.410
Yeah.

00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:15.340
Should not put the smallest
sphere for some reason.

00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:18.770
Yeah.

00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:19.290
No, no, no.

00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:20.970
A should not be the smallest.

00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:25.200
Just-- A is any sphere.

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:29.680
Just some sphere which
encloses the region.

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:30.180
Yes?

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:32.305
AUDIENCE: So it seems that
this argument implicitly

00:12:32.305 --> 00:12:34.110
assumed that in
order to add entropy,

00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:36.770
that sort of corresponds to
adding some amount of energy.

00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:38.840
But is it possible to
add entropy to the system

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:40.840
without adding
energy to the system?

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:42.041
HONG LIU: Oh, you can.

00:12:42.041 --> 00:12:42.540
You can.

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:44.420
They just make it even more.

00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:47.760
Whatever it is, this
is the final state.

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:51.290
So the base
assumption of this is

00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:57.310
that if you can put stuff
inside this region, whatever

00:12:57.310 --> 00:13:02.146
is inside, the sum is,
the maximal stuff you

00:13:02.146 --> 00:13:05.020
can put inside the region is
a black hole with the horizon

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:06.992
area.

00:13:06.992 --> 00:13:08.700
AUDIENCE: Well, I
guess what I'm confused

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:11.270
about is that it seems, that--
I certainly believe when

00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:13.170
you said, you can't
have a certain amount

00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:14.050
of energy in an area.

00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:15.620
But I'm not sure
why you can't have

00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:17.220
a certain amount of
entropy in an area

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:19.130
if energy and entropy are not--

00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:19.950
HONG LIU: No.

00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:22.070
We're not making
that assumption.

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:26.720
The entropy is just a
consequence of that.

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:29.070
This is the final state entropy.

00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:31.080
And the final state
entropy is always

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:34.566
larger than the entropy
of your initial state.

00:13:34.566 --> 00:13:35.107
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:13:35.107 --> 00:13:35.607
Sure.

00:13:35.607 --> 00:13:36.360
Fine.

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:36.680
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:37.180
Yeah.

00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:38.157
Entropy is derived.

00:13:38.157 --> 00:13:39.490
This equation is not assumption.

00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:40.065
It's derived.

00:13:40.065 --> 00:13:40.690
AUDIENCE: Fine.

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:41.680
OK.

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:45.790
HONG LIU: The assumption
is that the black hole

00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:49.460
is the maximal-- is the
most massive object you

00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:51.860
can put inside this region.

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:52.484
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:13:52.484 --> 00:13:52.983
I see.

00:13:52.983 --> 00:13:54.790
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:57.550
AUDIENCE: But you can't
have a less massive object

00:13:57.550 --> 00:13:59.929
with more than that entropy.

00:13:59.929 --> 00:14:00.470
HONG LIU: Hm?

00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:03.000
AUDIENCE: You can't have a less
massive object with entropy

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.670
that is more than that value.

00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:06.640
Inside the same region.

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:10.750
HONG LIU: This is
ruled out by this--

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:14.790
once you get this equation, then
you don't ask about the mass.

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:17.490
It just-- any entropy must
be smaller than this value.

00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:24.610
Any other questions?

00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:28.656
AUDIENCE: How do we keep track
of what the area of [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:31.554 --> 00:14:32.220
HONG LIU: Right.

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:37.277
So that's why I say this is a
little bit heuristic argument.

00:14:37.277 --> 00:14:39.360
And that's why I say this
is a heuristic argument.

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:40.514
Yeah.

00:14:40.514 --> 00:14:42.430
Yeah, indeed, you have
to be a little bit more

00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:43.450
careful about that.

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:58.060
Yeah but say if you-- the
key thing is about the area.

00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:00.975
And then this other
one cautions one maybe

00:15:00.975 --> 00:15:02.300
to have to think about it.

00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:04.015
When you include the
quantum corrections

00:15:04.015 --> 00:15:07.550
et cetera-- the back
reaction, et cetera.

00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:09.650
But the key thing is the
area of the black hole.

00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:12.650
It must be proportionate
to the area.

00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:14.010
AUDIENCE: Well.

00:15:14.010 --> 00:15:19.320
[INAUDIBLE] for some
function that the area

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:25.355
of the horizon with the black
hole is only based on the mass.

00:15:25.355 --> 00:15:25.980
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:26.240
Yeah.

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:26.740
Yeah.

00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:27.950
Yeah.

00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:31.440
So let me say again, there's
two natures of this argument.

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:35.750
The first nature
of the argument is,

00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:40.440
the maximal energy you
can put inside the region

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:43.630
is a black hole whose
horizon area is given

00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:45.387
by the area of this region.

00:15:45.387 --> 00:15:46.720
AUDIENCE: This is an assumption.

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:46.860
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:47.920
This is assumption.

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:49.840
Yeah, because we
know, in the GR,

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:51.430
any sufficiently
massive thing will

00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:53.144
collapse to form a black hole.

00:15:53.144 --> 00:15:53.810
AUDIENCE: Mmhmm.

00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:54.435
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:15:54.435 --> 00:15:57.030
And if you have a more
mass, then the horizon area

00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:58.260
would be outside.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.330
And then you will be
outside this area.

00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:04.420
You can no longer
keep this A fixed.

00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:05.900
So that's the first assumption.

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:11.000
So we said that assumption--
that assumption then

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.950
just follows from the second
law of thermodynamics.

00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:16.170
Because this is
whatever-- the entropy

00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:20.650
of the matter inside-- then this
is whatever the initial entropy

00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:22.935
of the energy-- you
need to put it in

00:16:22.935 --> 00:16:24.630
to make it into a black hole.

00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:26.640
And then that must be
smaller than the entropy

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:29.680
of the final state, which is
the entropy of the black hole.

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:33.433
AUDIENCE: But my question
is that by keeping A fixed,

00:16:33.433 --> 00:16:37.297
you might introduce extra
entropy into the system.

00:16:37.297 --> 00:16:38.270
HONG LIU: Hm?

00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:38.820
Yeah.

00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:39.680
It doesn't matter.

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:44.097
As far as the black hole
is the final entropy state.

00:16:44.097 --> 00:16:45.680
What you're saying
is that there might

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:46.763
be some other things here.

00:16:46.763 --> 00:16:47.710
It's fine.

00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:51.630
That does not change
the direction of this--

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:53.774
AUDIENCE: The entropy
might be negative.

00:16:53.774 --> 00:16:57.089
I'm not sure-- just--

00:16:57.089 --> 00:16:57.630
HONG LIU: No.

00:16:57.630 --> 00:16:58.130
No.

00:16:58.130 --> 00:17:01.710
Whatever it is--
this is my initial.

00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:03.760
So that's why this is
an inequality here.

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:05.270
This is not the equality.

00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:06.660
Inequality.

00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:10.260
And we're just using the
second law of thermodynamics.

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:11.750
This is your initial
state entropy.

00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:13.739
This is my final state entropy.

00:17:13.739 --> 00:17:15.030
This must be greater than that.

00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:19.200
We're not asking the
specific process.

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:22.551
We're not asking the
specific process.

00:17:22.551 --> 00:17:23.050
Yeah.

00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:25.591
Just, the final state must be
greater than the initial state.

00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:29.310
Good?

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:33.480
OK.

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:38.950
So now let's see what we can
try to go a little bit further

00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:41.030
from here.

00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:41.970
So now let's recall.

00:17:45.364 --> 00:17:46.905
So now we really
treat the black hole

00:17:46.905 --> 00:17:49.840
as a quantum statistical object.

00:17:49.840 --> 00:18:00.950
So now recall the
definition of entropy

00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:02.365
in quantum statistical physics.

00:18:41.741 --> 00:18:42.240
OK.

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:48.230
So if you say I
have some system,

00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:52.620
and the state of that system
is described by some density

00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:55.162
operator, or density
matrix, and then

00:18:55.162 --> 00:18:57.745
that the entropy of that system
is just given by this formula.

00:19:03.670 --> 00:19:23.250
In particular, for a system with
n-dimensional Hilbert space.

00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:32.350
OK.

00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:34.470
So this is the
n-dimensional Hilbert space.

00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:38.220
This is a dimension
of the Hilbert space.

00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:43.220
Let S max is log
N. So the maximum

00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:48.154
possible entropy you
can have is log N.

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:53.960
OK.

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:55.775
Is this fact familiar to you?

00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:02.492
So you can convince
yourself the maximal entropy

00:20:02.492 --> 00:20:08.900
is realized when role is just
given by 1/n times the identity

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:10.700
matrix.

00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:17.400
And so is the density matrix
which has low information.

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:20.120
Because every state
plays the same role.

00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:23.640
And this state-- then
you can plug in here

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:26.430
and give your log N.
And the maximum entropy

00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:28.810
means you have
minimal information.

00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:32.360
And that is the state
with minimal information.

00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:38.350
And you can also just prove
yourself using some algebra.

00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:42.490
But this is the physical
argument for this.

00:20:45.730 --> 00:20:51.380
So now, if you compare
with these two formula,

00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:55.160
then we can draw
a conclusion, is

00:20:55.160 --> 00:21:00.080
that-- so let me
add a word called

00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:08.775
effective-- effective
dimension-- of the Hilbert

00:21:08.775 --> 00:21:36.540
space for a system
inside a region of area A

00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:47.940
is bounded by log N must
be smaller than A h bar GN.

00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:59.700
So that tells you-- so
whatever you can put inside

00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:03.310
of this region of area A,
that's the maximal entropy you

00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:05.180
can have.

00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:07.619
So if you have N
degrees of freedom,

00:22:07.619 --> 00:22:09.160
then the maximal
entropy you can have

00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:11.935
for this N degrees
of freedom is log N.

00:22:11.935 --> 00:22:14.310
Then that tells you that log
N must be smaller than this.

00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:14.900
OK?

00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:18.320
Smaller or equal to that.

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:20.070
And so let me
write this in terms

00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:24.660
of the-- so this
can also, 4 h bar N

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:28.950
is also Planck length square.

00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:30.930
So it's also four times
a Planck length square.

00:22:34.318 --> 00:22:37.720
AUDIENCE: So for this
part, really Hilbert space

00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:39.780
really can be even infinite.

00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:40.847
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:22:40.847 --> 00:22:41.680
And let me say that.

00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:44.300
So that's why we
need "effective."

00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:45.860
So now let me make some remarks.

00:22:48.570 --> 00:22:49.975
Let me make some remarks.

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:02.550
So zero remarks.

00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:11.950
It says, for system of n spins
say, n spins half particle--

00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:15.850
so when I say spins, I always
means spins half-- then

00:23:15.850 --> 00:23:18.660
the dimension of the Hilbert
space is 2 to the power n.

00:23:21.370 --> 00:23:22.260
Just to remind you.

00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:37.200
But the dimension of h-- the
Hilbert space-- so normally I

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:41.090
just group h to denote
the Hilbert space--

00:23:41.090 --> 00:23:43.570
for a single
harmonic oscillator.

00:23:49.890 --> 00:23:52.240
So the simplest system is spin.

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:54.730
Then the next simplest
system is essentially

00:23:54.730 --> 00:23:57.260
a harmonic oscillator.

00:23:57.260 --> 00:24:01.520
And even for a single
harmonic oscillator, then

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:03.070
the dimension of h is infinite.

00:24:06.010 --> 00:24:07.510
OK.

00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:10.280
And then you ask what
I'm talking about here.

00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:12.110
Because here I say
the Hilbert space

00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:13.300
should be smaller than that.

00:24:16.570 --> 00:24:19.252
But.

00:24:19.252 --> 00:24:21.460
So even though, even for a
single harmonic oscillator

00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:28.325
the Hilbert space is infinite,
but for a quantum mechanical

00:24:28.325 --> 00:24:38.780
system, for a quantum system
with a finite number of degrees

00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:46.680
of freedom-- by finite
number of degrees of freedom,

00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:49.040
for example, you can
interpret this, for example,

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:53.560
as a finite number of
harmonic oscillators, OK--

00:24:53.560 --> 00:25:02.130
the dimension of
the Hilbert space

00:25:02.130 --> 00:25:12.160
below some finite energy scale.

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:15.995
Energy is always finite.

00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:23.700
It's always finite.

00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:28.020
And so that's why I use
the word "effective" there.

00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:32.280
And because normally we all
consider the finite energy,

00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:34.460
because the system will
have finite energy,

00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:36.790
and then you have,
effectively, a finite dimension

00:25:36.790 --> 00:25:38.010
of Hilbert space.

00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:40.400
OK?

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:43.080
So this equation
is not that crazy.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:53.750
So I mean typical-- so actually,
in typical physical systems,

00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:56.980
even for harmonic oscillators,
both for spin or harmonic

00:25:56.980 --> 00:26:12.380
oscillators, essentially,
number of degrees of freedom

00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:20.420
is of all the log N. Yeah,
N is the effective dimension

00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:23.780
of your Hilbert space.

00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:27.350
Yeah, this is obvious
from the spin.

00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:31.370
This is also obvious if you
have a harmonic oscillator.

00:26:31.370 --> 00:26:34.980
So if each harmonic oscillator
is finitely excited.

00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:39.110
And again, roughly the
log N is the number

00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:40.110
of harmonic oscillators.

00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:47.900
So because of this we can
also write this equation

00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:58.320
as the number of degrees of
freedom of any quantum gravity

00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:12.260
system inside the
region A can be--

00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:15.410
should be smaller
than-- should be bounded

00:27:15.410 --> 00:27:16.700
by the area of that region.

00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:49.710
So this bond is
certainly violated

00:27:49.710 --> 00:28:03.200
in non-gravitational
systems because

00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:06.460
in non-gravitational
systems whose number

00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:15.340
of degrees of freedom
and thus, the log

00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:19.420
N, the log of your dimension
of your Hilbert space,

00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:31.620
is proportional to the
volume rather than area.

00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:40.790
So when the reading
is big enough,

00:28:40.790 --> 00:28:44.710
then you are guaranteed
to violate this bound.

00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:49.670
Because, of course, the volume
grows faster than the area

00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:53.320
if you have a sufficiently
larger region.

00:28:53.320 --> 00:29:05.210
So for example, consider
just a lattice of spins--

00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:09.610
so a three dimensional lattice
of spins-- of lattice spacing

00:29:09.610 --> 00:29:28.730
a-- say of lattice spacing a--
then the total number of spins

00:29:28.730 --> 00:29:35.240
that is given by volume
divided by A cubed.

00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:38.180
So this is essentially the
number of degrees of freedom.

00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:43.760
And then this is given by A,
the area, divided by a squared,

00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:45.250
times L divided by a.

00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:49.710
And this can be
much, much greater

00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:57.380
than a divided by Planck
square, Planck length square,

00:29:57.380 --> 00:29:58.730
for L sufficiently large.

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:09.750
They are large enough.

00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:12.930
So if you have a long
gravitational system,

00:30:12.930 --> 00:30:14.680
then this boundary can
be easily violated.

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:23.190
In particular, this
equation can also

00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:32.330
be violated because the
dimension of the Hilbert space

00:30:32.330 --> 00:30:37.510
that in this case would
2 to the power a cubed,

00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:44.050
and similarly-- so a-- so
the maximal entropy would be,

00:30:44.050 --> 00:30:50.410
say, v divided by a cubed log
2, because it's a spin 2 system,

00:30:50.410 --> 00:30:51.610
spin half system.

00:30:51.610 --> 00:30:55.050
So this can be larger than
the entropy of a black hole.

00:30:58.090 --> 00:31:06.320
So it's key that we can see
the gravitational systems.

00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:08.370
Only in gravitational
systems you

00:31:08.370 --> 00:31:11.470
have this remarkable
feature that if you-- things

00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:13.355
will collapse.

00:31:13.355 --> 00:31:14.230
Things will collapse.

00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:19.210
And then you will
have this upper limit

00:31:19.210 --> 00:31:20.833
provided by the black hole.

00:31:20.833 --> 00:31:21.333
Yes?

00:31:21.333 --> 00:31:23.249
AUDIENCE: So in the real
world, every system's

00:31:23.249 --> 00:31:24.216
a gravitational system.

00:31:24.216 --> 00:31:24.840
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:26.655
AUDIENCE: So this is
just-- in some sense,

00:31:26.655 --> 00:31:28.850
this is not actually
correct in the real world.

00:31:28.850 --> 00:31:32.216
HONG LIU: Yeah, but you need
this L to be not enough.

00:31:32.216 --> 00:31:33.245
AUDIENCE: I see.

00:31:33.245 --> 00:31:33.870
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:38.330
Yes?

00:31:38.330 --> 00:31:39.380
AUDIENCE: So, right.

00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:42.370
In the real world, this bound
has to be obeyed by systems.

00:31:42.370 --> 00:31:46.630
So does that put some bounds
on QFT UV completions?

00:31:46.630 --> 00:31:47.820
HONG LIU: Hm?

00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:49.800
AUDIENCE: So, in the
real world this bound

00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:51.316
has to be obeyed by everything.

00:31:51.316 --> 00:31:51.940
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:54.106
AUDIENCE: So does that put
some kind of restrictions

00:31:54.106 --> 00:31:55.900
on QFT UV completion?

00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:57.830
Because we usually say
it's infinite density

00:31:57.830 --> 00:32:00.010
of degrees of freedom.

00:32:00.010 --> 00:32:02.480
HONG LIU: No, because
UV completion of QFT

00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:04.812
is provided by gravity.

00:32:04.812 --> 00:32:05.970
AUDIENCE: For any QFT.

00:32:05.970 --> 00:32:09.470
I just mean, like,
a scalar fuel.

00:32:09.470 --> 00:32:12.042
HONG LIU: Then that's not
the theory of gravity.

00:32:12.042 --> 00:32:13.750
AUDIENCE: Right, but
if you have a scalar

00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:18.575
fuel in space time, which has GR
in it, is otherwise like, flat?

00:32:18.575 --> 00:32:19.200
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:22.330
Then the GR-- then the gravity
will provide the UV completion

00:32:22.330 --> 00:32:24.465
on that scalar field.

00:32:24.465 --> 00:32:25.090
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:32:25.090 --> 00:32:25.715
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:30.360
Right.

00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:32.410
I was going to say something
else, but I forgot.

00:32:32.410 --> 00:32:34.096
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:32:34.096 --> 00:32:34.720
HONG LIU: Haha.

00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:36.568
AUDIENCE: What about the
ones that are to be complete?

00:32:36.568 --> 00:32:37.030
HONG LIU: Hm?

00:32:37.030 --> 00:32:38.460
AUDIENCE: What
about the theories

00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:41.295
that are to be complete
at least, formally?

00:32:41.295 --> 00:32:43.220
HONG LIU: Uh.

00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:44.270
Sorry, say it again?

00:32:44.270 --> 00:32:46.915
AUDIENCE: The QFTs that
are to be complete.

00:32:46.915 --> 00:32:47.540
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:48.570
They are limited by gravity.

00:32:48.570 --> 00:32:48.840
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:49.465
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:32:49.465 --> 00:32:51.360
The gravity will still
provide something.

00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:53.735
Because a QFT have infinite
number of degrees of freedom.

00:32:58.210 --> 00:33:00.690
Yeah.

00:33:00.690 --> 00:33:03.790
So as an example of
this, for example you

00:33:03.790 --> 00:33:09.330
can think of a classroom,
say, full of photons,

00:33:09.330 --> 00:33:11.480
and then you can
calculate entropy.

00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:14.090
Again, that entropy will be
proportional to the volume.

00:33:14.090 --> 00:33:17.200
So if you make the
classroom big enough,

00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:20.010
then that will
violate this bound.

00:33:20.010 --> 00:33:22.612
But it's a simple exercise
for you to do yourself,

00:33:22.612 --> 00:33:24.820
that if you put the classroom
at a finite temperature

00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:28.780
of photons, then when
the room is big enough,

00:33:28.780 --> 00:33:32.010
there's always a
radius that will

00:33:32.010 --> 00:33:35.157
collapse to form a black hole
before this bound is violated.

00:33:35.157 --> 00:33:35.990
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:36.400
HONG LIU: OK.

00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:38.400
I think maybe I have this
formula in the p-set.

00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:39.816
I forgot whether
I have it or not.

00:33:39.816 --> 00:33:43.420
Yeah, you can do this
simple exercise yourself.

00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:47.590
Yeah just imagine you
have a box of photons

00:33:47.590 --> 00:33:49.970
at any non-zero
temperature t, and then

00:33:49.970 --> 00:33:54.110
when you put the box big enough,
then at a certain point then

00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:58.485
this whole box of photons will
collapse to form a black hole.

00:34:01.870 --> 00:34:07.560
And that's within to make
this bound to be satisfied.

00:34:10.489 --> 00:34:17.790
So what this means--
that if you have gravity,

00:34:17.790 --> 00:34:31.794
the quantum gravity leads to
a huge reduction of number

00:34:31.794 --> 00:34:32.710
of degrees of freedom.

00:34:38.449 --> 00:34:42.446
It's really bounded
by your area.

00:34:42.446 --> 00:34:45.694
AUDIENCE: Now, in previous
argument [INAUDIBLE],

00:34:45.694 --> 00:34:48.369
you have a conformal
field theory.

00:34:48.369 --> 00:34:55.060
And so this other [INAUDIBLE] we
don't need to have [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:55.749
HONG LIU: No.

00:34:55.749 --> 00:34:56.429
Yeah.

00:34:56.429 --> 00:35:01.520
As I was answering Pavel before,
if you have a conformal field

00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:04.660
theory just by itself,
then there's no bound.

00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:05.370
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:35:05.370 --> 00:35:06.250
HONG LIU: Then there's no bound.

00:35:06.250 --> 00:35:06.900
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:09.191
HONG LIU: But if you couple
this conformal field theory

00:35:09.191 --> 00:35:12.117
to gravity, then at
sufficiently high energy,

00:35:12.117 --> 00:35:14.700
and then the degrees of freedom
of this conformal field theory

00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:15.366
must be reduced.

00:35:15.366 --> 00:35:18.920
AUDIENCE: No, but, if you just
had a conformal field theory,

00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:19.920
then there's no bound.

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:20.711
HONG LIU: No bound.

00:35:20.711 --> 00:35:21.720
Yeah.

00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:23.410
Yeah, but you can
ask what happens

00:35:23.410 --> 00:35:28.670
if we couple a conformal
field theory to gravity.

00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:31.420
Not even conformal field theory,
just any quantum field theory,

00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:33.047
because any quantum field
theory has an infinite number

00:35:33.047 --> 00:35:35.505
of degrees of freedom, and the
number of degrees of freedom

00:35:35.505 --> 00:35:37.690
is also proportional
to the volume.

00:35:37.690 --> 00:35:42.420
And if you couple it to
gravity, then this reduction

00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:44.180
must happen.

00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:45.640
This reduction must happen.

00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:47.430
OK.

00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:53.970
So now if we take a
small leap of faith--

00:35:53.970 --> 00:35:56.870
so we already have taken
some leaps of faith,

00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:59.640
but let's take one more
stab, or leap of faith-- then

00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:01.330
you can formulate
something called

00:36:01.330 --> 00:36:02.415
the holographic principle.

00:36:09.302 --> 00:36:10.760
So given that the
number of degrees

00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:16.720
of freedom inside the region
is always bounded by the area,

00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:19.170
and this area actually
has a very nice way,

00:36:19.170 --> 00:36:22.720
it's area in the unit
of a Planck lens--

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:26.980
it looks like we have a minimal
lens-- minimal area which

00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:29.140
is a Planck's square
lens-- and just

00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:32.020
the area divided by that gives
you the total number of degrees

00:36:32.020 --> 00:36:32.520
of freedom.

00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:33.820
OK.

00:36:33.820 --> 00:36:38.090
So if you try to extrapolate
a little bit further,

00:36:38.090 --> 00:36:40.840
then we have the so-called
holographic principle.

00:36:40.840 --> 00:37:02.860
It says, in quantum gravity,
a region of boundary area A

00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:18.700
can be fully described--
can be fully described

00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:26.120
by no more than--
so essentially it's

00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:37.874
just A h bar hN equals
A [INAUDIBLE] squared

00:37:37.874 --> 00:37:38.540
degrees freedom.

00:37:41.370 --> 00:37:49.380
In other words, one degree
of freedom per Planck area.

00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:09.670
So this is a rough formulation
of the holographic principle.

00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:22.560
So what we just said--
it just highlights

00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:27.750
a point we made earlier--
is that even though naively,

00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:32.270
from dimensional analysis,
that the quantum gravity

00:38:32.270 --> 00:38:36.230
is only operating, say,
at the Planck scale.

00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:39.136
Say, at the Planck mass
or [INAUDIBLE], et cetera.

00:38:39.136 --> 00:38:44.450
And we see that the
black hole actually

00:38:44.450 --> 00:38:47.300
brings the quantum
gravity really

00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:49.350
need to macroscopic level.

00:38:49.350 --> 00:38:50.070
OK.

00:38:50.070 --> 00:38:53.740
Because this is, really
macroscopic statement

00:38:53.740 --> 00:38:57.230
can apply to regions
of arbitrary sides.

00:38:57.230 --> 00:39:01.420
But somehow, they are limited by
constraints of quantum gravity.

00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:01.950
OK.

00:39:01.950 --> 00:39:07.950
So this is a remarkable
manifestation

00:39:07.950 --> 00:39:11.470
of the quantum effect.

00:39:11.470 --> 00:39:12.490
Any questions on this?

00:39:12.490 --> 00:39:13.240
Yes?

00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:14.615
AUDIENCE: What's
so special about

00:39:14.615 --> 00:39:17.089
the dimensional differences?

00:39:17.089 --> 00:39:17.630
HONG LIU: Oh.

00:39:17.630 --> 00:39:17.950
Yeah.

00:39:17.950 --> 00:39:18.110
Yeah.

00:39:18.110 --> 00:39:20.060
This we can generalize
to any dimension.

00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:21.700
There's always
core dimension two.

00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:27.410
So if you live in
five dimensions,

00:39:27.410 --> 00:39:29.595
then becomes three
dimensions-- yeah,

00:39:29.595 --> 00:39:34.750
it's always co-dimension
y in the spatial region.

00:39:34.750 --> 00:39:39.070
Because the black hole--
just area of the black hole

00:39:39.070 --> 00:39:41.940
is always co-dimension
y in terms of spatial.

00:39:41.940 --> 00:39:42.934
Yeah.

00:39:42.934 --> 00:39:48.401
AUDIENCE: Well, can't it
be just [INAUDIBLE] sphere,

00:39:48.401 --> 00:39:49.760
and then it's [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:50.450
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:39:50.450 --> 00:39:52.660
10-dimensional
space, then naively,

00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:58.072
this would be constrained by
eight-dimensional surface.

00:39:58.072 --> 00:39:59.840
Yeah.

00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:01.579
Yeah, just, no matter
what dimension,

00:40:01.579 --> 00:40:03.870
it's always constrained by
the surface, not constrained

00:40:03.870 --> 00:40:05.409
by the volume.

00:40:05.409 --> 00:40:06.450
No matter what dimension.

00:40:10.589 --> 00:40:11.255
Other questions?

00:40:11.255 --> 00:40:13.705
AUDIENCE: I just have a
question about [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:13.705 --> 00:40:14.330
HONG LIU: Yeah?

00:40:14.330 --> 00:40:18.885
AUDIENCE: So it seems like
we are constraining a system

00:40:18.885 --> 00:40:24.258
[INAUDIBLE] theory that its
number of states for a given

00:40:24.258 --> 00:40:31.174
energy must grow slower somehow
because we must be lower

00:40:31.174 --> 00:40:32.310
than some finite energy.

00:40:32.310 --> 00:40:32.935
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:40:32.935 --> 00:40:34.991
AUDIENCE: The number of
[INAUDIBLE] must be below

00:40:34.991 --> 00:40:35.490
certain--

00:40:35.490 --> 00:40:36.370
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:40:36.370 --> 00:40:44.760
Just say-- essentially,
what we said earlier,

00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:47.390
is if you are in the
theory of quantum gravity,

00:40:47.390 --> 00:40:50.860
there's a cutoff on the
maximal energy you can have.

00:40:50.860 --> 00:40:54.270
And there's a cutoff also on
the maximal energy you can have,

00:40:54.270 --> 00:40:56.570
because otherwise you
form a black hole,

00:40:56.570 --> 00:40:59.780
and then that cutoff
will translate

00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:02.090
into the state of the
[INAUDIBLE] of entropy

00:41:02.090 --> 00:41:04.460
and into the number
of degrees of freedom.

00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:05.500
AUDIENCE: Yes, I mean--

00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:07.291
HONG LIU: Because much
easier-- yeah, yeah.

00:41:07.291 --> 00:41:08.768
AUDIENCE: I mean,
for example, we

00:41:08.768 --> 00:41:11.469
have-- first we start
with a simple series,

00:41:11.469 --> 00:41:14.906
and maybe, for example, we add,
for example, standard model,

00:41:14.906 --> 00:41:19.325
then we add super symmetry,
then-- energy spectrum-- the

00:41:19.325 --> 00:41:23.660
limiting energy that is there,
but the number of Hilbert space

00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:27.696
state is more, and we can
keep doing things like that.

00:41:27.696 --> 00:41:28.320
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:29.650
AUDIENCE: But we can't.

00:41:29.650 --> 00:41:32.695
Because it must be
below these values.

00:41:32.695 --> 00:41:33.320
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:37.580
But you see, there is something
about the volume here.

00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:42.450
You have to talk about
within some region.

00:41:42.450 --> 00:41:46.410
Of course, abstractly, you
can put some degree-- yeah,

00:41:46.410 --> 00:41:49.590
maybe I'm not getting
your question.

00:41:49.590 --> 00:41:52.100
AUDIENCE: How do
you say-- naively,

00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:56.970
we think, we can
just, for example,

00:41:56.970 --> 00:41:59.930
say if the energy boundary
is here, and below this,

00:41:59.930 --> 00:42:01.665
how many states we could have?

00:42:01.665 --> 00:42:02.540
HONG LIU: No, no, no.

00:42:02.540 --> 00:42:03.956
This is not the
direction in terms

00:42:03.956 --> 00:42:05.810
of the entropy-- energy bound.

00:42:05.810 --> 00:42:13.220
This is, in the end, is the
bound on the [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:17.780
degrees of freedom you
can put inside a region.

00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:20.720
If you put too many degrees
of freedom inside the region,

00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:22.840
then you need to
enlarge the region.

00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:23.340
Yeah.

00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:25.800
Just say, look at the
number of degrees of freedom

00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:26.960
is incompatible.

00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:29.684
Something like that.

00:42:29.684 --> 00:42:30.225
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:42:30.225 --> 00:42:33.111
I have a question
regarding [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:33.111 --> 00:42:34.710
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:36.174
AUDIENCE: I still
don't understand.

00:42:36.174 --> 00:42:40.175
Shouldn't an isolated
system mean also included

00:42:40.175 --> 00:42:42.719
the machinery to
do these things?

00:42:42.719 --> 00:42:43.260
HONG LIU: No.

00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:45.760
I'm just saying you start
with the isolated system.

00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:49.440
Then you can add something
to that isolated system.

00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:51.403
AUDIENCE: What about
if we take matters out

00:42:51.403 --> 00:42:55.670
of the black hole,
these [INAUDIBLE]?

00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:57.550
HONG LIU: That thing,
that isolated system,

00:42:57.550 --> 00:42:59.690
does not have to
be a black hole.

00:42:59.690 --> 00:43:01.340
It can be anything.

00:43:01.340 --> 00:43:02.460
It just can be anything.

00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:05.310
AUDIENCE: So if we instead
of putting energy inside,

00:43:05.310 --> 00:43:08.115
we take energy out,
entropy will decrease?

00:43:08.115 --> 00:43:08.740
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:43:08.740 --> 00:43:10.010
Just take entropy out.

00:43:10.010 --> 00:43:11.320
Yeah.

00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:14.011
Then this bound will
be even more satisfied.

00:43:14.011 --> 00:43:15.935
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:15.935 --> 00:43:17.859
AUDIENCE: I have
a question there,

00:43:17.859 --> 00:43:22.791
that the degree of freedom--
I mean log of the degree

00:43:22.791 --> 00:43:23.380
of freedom--

00:43:23.380 --> 00:43:23.570
HONG LIU: No.

00:43:23.570 --> 00:43:24.070
No.

00:43:24.070 --> 00:43:27.364
N is the dimension
of the Hilbert space.

00:43:27.364 --> 00:43:29.030
N is the dimension
of the Hilbert space.

00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:30.817
That's why I called it N, here.

00:43:30.817 --> 00:43:31.400
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:33.812
HONG LIU: N, the dimension
of the Hilbert space.

00:43:33.812 --> 00:43:35.720
AUDIENCE: But-- the
degree of freedom is--

00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:38.420
HONG LIU: Typically, the
number of-- the dimension

00:43:38.420 --> 00:43:41.960
of the Hilbert space is
exponential of the lambda

00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:42.940
of degrees of freedom.

00:43:42.940 --> 00:43:43.481
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:43:43.481 --> 00:43:44.130
OK.

00:43:44.130 --> 00:43:45.000
HONG LIU: Just look at here.

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:45.260
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:45.890
I see.

00:43:45.890 --> 00:43:47.056
HONG LIU: Just look at here.

00:43:47.056 --> 00:43:48.780
Yeah.

00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:50.791
Any other questions?

00:43:50.791 --> 00:43:51.290
OK.

00:43:55.162 --> 00:43:56.995
AUDIENCE: If we have a
quantum field theory,

00:43:56.995 --> 00:43:58.680
it has a certain
vacuum energy, right?

00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:02.460
And then if you now consider
that to be the vacuum energy

00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:05.020
and you expand it at some
point, it will actually

00:44:05.020 --> 00:44:06.820
collapse into a black hole?

00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:09.660
So if you take the
vacuum energy to be

00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:13.185
that predicted by QFT,
then for the universe,

00:44:13.185 --> 00:44:15.430
it would not work.

00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:17.758
Even theoretically-- I know
the [INAUDIBLE] constant

00:44:17.758 --> 00:44:20.450
is like 120 orders less, but.

00:44:20.450 --> 00:44:24.870
HONG LIU: Yeah, that's a little
bit tricky because-- yeah,

00:44:24.870 --> 00:44:27.737
so the vacuum energy
will make it into, say,

00:44:27.737 --> 00:44:30.320
depending on whether the vacuum
energy is positive or negative

00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:34.230
will make it into de Sitter,
anti-de Sitter, then, yeah,

00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:40.237
then you try to see whether--
it depends on details.

00:44:40.237 --> 00:44:41.695
AUDIENCE: But if
you go big enough,

00:44:41.695 --> 00:44:44.289
it's going to collapse, or--

00:44:44.289 --> 00:44:44.830
HONG LIU: No.

00:44:44.830 --> 00:44:45.430
Not necessarily.

00:44:45.430 --> 00:44:47.180
I'm just saying that
you have to formulate

00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:48.525
a little bit differently.

00:44:48.525 --> 00:44:50.150
You're talking about
a particular state

00:44:50.150 --> 00:44:53.080
of certain energy to
couple to gravity,

00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:56.110
then you just take that
state coupled to gravity

00:44:56.110 --> 00:44:57.950
to see what you get.

00:44:57.950 --> 00:44:59.758
Yeah, then ask
questions from there.

00:44:59.758 --> 00:45:01.900
Yeah.

00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:03.440
Good.

00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:06.780
So now let's move
to a new topic.

00:45:06.780 --> 00:45:15.720
Still, it's in the preparation
to go to the duality

00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:23.200
but we need a lot of pieces
of important intuition

00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:26.045
in order to fully
appreciate the duality.

00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:34.100
And in this piece of
intuition is Large N theories.

00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:39.710
And let me call it
Large N matrix theories.

00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:57.220
So now we try to look at the
hint for holographic duality

00:45:57.220 --> 00:46:01.060
from the field theory side.

00:46:01.060 --> 00:46:05.110
So so far, we have been talking
about the hint for holographic

00:46:05.110 --> 00:46:08.910
from the gravity
side, and now we

00:46:08.910 --> 00:46:10.800
look at it from the
field theory side,

00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:13.430
to see, actually from
field theory side,

00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:17.470
there also some hints
to relate a long gravity

00:46:17.470 --> 00:46:19.720
system to a gravity system.

00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:21.100
OK.

00:46:21.100 --> 00:46:22.200
So let's start with QCD.

00:46:28.580 --> 00:46:37.890
So QCD is a SU(3) gauge
theory plus quarks.

00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:45.470
So let me just write
down it's Lagrangian.

00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:13.670
So this F describes the
gluon fields and this side

00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:14.990
describes the quarks.

00:47:14.990 --> 00:47:16.510
OK.

00:47:16.510 --> 00:47:24.010
So this F is built out of
the standard partial mu

00:47:24.010 --> 00:47:33.110
A mu minus partial mu
A mu minus A mu A mu,

00:47:33.110 --> 00:47:37.760
and A mu-- each gauge field
is a 3 by 3 Hermitian matrix.

00:47:43.220 --> 00:47:46.030
So these are 3 times
3 Hermitian matrix.

00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:51.540
So this is using
the matrix notation,

00:47:51.540 --> 00:47:53.010
so F is also a matrix.

00:47:53.010 --> 00:47:55.150
So there's a trace here.

00:47:55.150 --> 00:47:57.100
OK.

00:47:57.100 --> 00:47:57.845
Hermitian matrix.

00:48:03.820 --> 00:48:06.688
And then the T to a is
just generators of SU(3).

00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:14.740
So it doesn't matter
if you don't know QCD.

00:48:14.740 --> 00:48:19.590
It doesn't matter if you
have not seen QCD before.

00:48:19.590 --> 00:48:23.150
The only thing that
matters is just

00:48:23.150 --> 00:48:28.140
to remember that QCD is
a series of matrices.

00:48:28.140 --> 00:48:30.130
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:48:30.130 --> 00:48:33.221
HONG LIU: QCD is a series
of 3 by 3 matrices.

00:48:33.221 --> 00:48:33.720
OK.

00:48:33.720 --> 00:48:38.270
So the gluon field
is 3 by 3 matrices.

00:48:38.270 --> 00:48:42.750
It's described by matrices.

00:48:42.750 --> 00:48:44.550
So of course, one of
the remarkable things

00:48:44.550 --> 00:48:48.710
about the QCD-- what's the most
remarkable thing about QCD,

00:48:48.710 --> 00:48:49.838
do you know?

00:48:49.838 --> 00:48:52.086
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:52.086 --> 00:48:52.710
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:48:52.710 --> 00:48:53.766
That's one.

00:48:53.766 --> 00:48:54.700
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:48:54.700 --> 00:48:57.110
HONG LIU: And what other
remarkable thing about the QCD?

00:48:57.110 --> 00:48:58.852
AUDIENCE: Soft coupling?

00:48:58.852 --> 00:48:59.393
HONG LIU: Hm?

00:48:59.393 --> 00:49:00.340
AUDIENCE: Soft coupling.

00:49:00.340 --> 00:49:00.630
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:49:00.630 --> 00:49:01.700
It's related to that.

00:49:01.700 --> 00:49:02.392
AUDIENCE: Confinement, then.

00:49:02.392 --> 00:49:04.683
HONG LIU: Yeah, confinement,
it's also related to that.

00:49:04.683 --> 00:49:09.840
It's just-- yeah, one of
the most remarkable things

00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:12.040
about QCD is it's
still not solvable.

00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:16.540
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:18.414
HONG LIU: And the
reason it's not solvable

00:49:18.414 --> 00:49:20.080
is because when you've
got low energies,

00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:22.160
the coupling becomes
strong, then we

00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:23.700
don't know how to deal with it.

00:49:23.700 --> 00:49:25.500
OK.

00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:27.250
So we still don't know
how to calculate it

00:49:27.250 --> 00:49:28.250
from first principle.

00:49:28.250 --> 00:49:31.290
Of course, we can put
it on the computer,

00:49:31.290 --> 00:49:36.810
but just from the-- in terms
of theoretical understanding,

00:49:36.810 --> 00:49:39.420
it's hard.

00:49:39.420 --> 00:49:49.750
So in 1974-- so this is an old
problem-- so starting in 1974--

00:49:49.750 --> 00:49:54.960
starting in 1971, people
already tried to solve it.

00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:57.850
So in 1974-- so the big
problem with of this thing

00:49:57.850 --> 00:50:01.530
is that in quantum field theory,
normally we do expansions.

00:50:01.530 --> 00:50:02.680
OK.

00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:06.670
Say we find some starting
point, so in physics, that's

00:50:06.670 --> 00:50:07.730
what we always do.

00:50:07.730 --> 00:50:10.700
We find the starting
point, which can be solved.

00:50:10.700 --> 00:50:13.600
Then we expand around
that starting point.

00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:17.490
And that starting point
is often a free theory.

00:50:17.490 --> 00:50:22.430
And then it may expand
upon the free theory.

00:50:22.430 --> 00:50:26.570
So the difficult thing about
this theory is at first,

00:50:26.570 --> 00:50:30.310
it's hard, when you go
to low energies-- first

00:50:30.310 --> 00:50:32.630
it's hard to find
the starting point.

00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:35.330
And the second is that's
there's nothing to expand.

00:50:35.330 --> 00:50:37.250
Because there's no
small parameters.

00:50:37.250 --> 00:50:37.750
OK.

00:50:37.750 --> 00:50:40.034
There's no small parameters.

00:50:40.034 --> 00:50:41.700
When you need to
expand, you will always

00:50:41.700 --> 00:50:43.710
need a small parameter.

00:50:43.710 --> 00:50:48.722
So in 1974, t' Hooft came
up with a very nice idea.

00:50:48.722 --> 00:50:49.680
He said, this is SU(3).

00:50:52.812 --> 00:50:54.270
He said, let's just
think of taking

00:50:54.270 --> 00:51:04.075
the number of colors, which is
N equal to 3, as a parameter.

00:51:08.830 --> 00:51:14.770
So even though you
realize, he said, there's

00:51:14.770 --> 00:51:16.700
only three types of colors.

00:51:16.700 --> 00:51:20.030
But let's imagine we treat
it as a free parameter.

00:51:20.030 --> 00:51:21.300
OK.

00:51:21.300 --> 00:51:31.480
So this just implies, say
you promote the gauge field

00:51:31.480 --> 00:51:33.140
by M matrices.

00:51:33.140 --> 00:51:34.481
And by N Hermitian matrices.

00:51:34.481 --> 00:51:34.980
OK.

00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:44.252
He said, let's just treat this
in terms of N by N matrices.

00:51:44.252 --> 00:51:46.710
And then this let's consider
that N goes to infinity limit.

00:52:04.271 --> 00:52:06.270
So let's consider that N
goes to infinity limit.

00:52:13.110 --> 00:52:17.180
So he reasoned, if N
goes to infinity limit,

00:52:17.180 --> 00:52:21.880
it's sufficiently simple, then
maybe we can solve that limit.

00:52:21.880 --> 00:52:26.340
And then do 1/N expansion.

00:52:26.340 --> 00:52:28.090
1/N is a small parameter.

00:52:28.090 --> 00:52:31.620
Then we can treat 1/N
as a small parameter

00:52:31.620 --> 00:52:34.540
and then do one
of the expansions.

00:52:34.540 --> 00:52:36.760
OK.

00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:38.540
So that's the rough idea.

00:52:38.540 --> 00:52:41.150
And then you get a
small parameter of 1/N.

00:52:41.150 --> 00:52:43.270
So in real life,
N will be three.

00:52:43.270 --> 00:52:45.630
So 1/3.

00:52:45.630 --> 00:52:49.060
It's not very small, but
it's at least smaller than 1.

00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:57.230
OK, so, this turns out
to be a genius idea.

00:52:57.230 --> 00:52:59.590
Turns out to be a genius idea.

00:52:59.590 --> 00:53:02.845
But unfortunately, QCD still
cannot be solved this way.

00:53:02.845 --> 00:53:05.475
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:53:05.475 --> 00:53:06.850
HONG LIU: But
there's a surprise.

00:53:06.850 --> 00:53:09.430
But there's a surprise.

00:53:09.430 --> 00:53:12.290
So, still, QCD, you
cannot solve this way.

00:53:12.290 --> 00:53:16.200
Even N going to infinity limit
turned out to be too hard.

00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:18.120
But there's a surprise.

00:53:18.120 --> 00:53:32.530
It turns out this 1/N expansion
gives you a string theory.

00:53:37.580 --> 00:53:40.160
OK.

00:53:40.160 --> 00:53:44.460
So I will now explain this, OK.

00:53:44.460 --> 00:53:46.830
I will now explain this.

00:53:46.830 --> 00:53:50.350
So there's a byproduct
of his large N expansion.

00:53:50.350 --> 00:53:54.710
You said, you find that
this actually-- such a gauge

00:53:54.710 --> 00:53:58.920
theory actually sticks
with real string theory.

00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:04.880
So the key is that these
fields are matrices.

00:54:04.880 --> 00:54:05.380
OK.

00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:13.537
So the key reason
this emerges is

00:54:13.537 --> 00:54:15.870
because we are working with
a field, which are matrices.

00:54:19.820 --> 00:54:26.621
So to illustrate this,
I will not do the QCD.

00:54:26.621 --> 00:54:27.870
It's a little bit complicated.

00:54:27.870 --> 00:54:29.790
I will just do a simple
scalar field theory.

00:54:29.790 --> 00:54:31.700
OK.

00:54:31.700 --> 00:54:33.680
So I will just do a
simple scalar field theory

00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:35.311
as an illustration.

00:54:35.311 --> 00:54:36.936
So let's consider
the following theory.

00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:05.080
OK.

00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:09.040
So this g is still
coupling constants.

00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:11.045
But what we do is actually
convenient to put it

00:55:11.045 --> 00:55:12.780
in the front.

00:55:12.780 --> 00:55:15.810
Of course you can rescale
it-- you can rescale it,

00:55:15.810 --> 00:55:18.300
you put it here, which
is the normal place.

00:55:18.300 --> 00:55:20.470
But I put it in the front.

00:55:20.470 --> 00:55:23.620
Just like what we
normally do also for QCD.

00:55:23.620 --> 00:55:26.940
So this g is coupling constant
which we put in the front.

00:55:26.940 --> 00:55:29.010
And then each phi,
again, I take it to be

00:55:29.010 --> 00:55:30.790
N by N in the Hermitian matrix.

00:55:33.450 --> 00:55:37.550
Phi x, each one
is a matrix a, b.

00:55:37.550 --> 00:55:40.190
So I have two index.

00:55:40.190 --> 00:55:41.860
So this N by N Hermitian matrix.

00:55:44.270 --> 00:55:44.770
Yeah.

00:55:44.770 --> 00:55:45.890
N by N, Hermitian matrix.

00:55:49.840 --> 00:56:04.610
So which means that phi a b,
equal to star equal to phi b a.

00:56:04.610 --> 00:56:05.110
OK.

00:56:10.190 --> 00:56:12.690
So there's a difference between
the upper and lower indices.

00:56:12.690 --> 00:56:13.189
OK.

00:56:16.575 --> 00:56:18.866
So I can write it more explicit
in terms of components.

00:56:21.580 --> 00:56:24.610
So just to give you,
in case some of you

00:56:24.610 --> 00:56:29.802
are not familiar with this kind
of matrix kind of field theory,

00:56:29.802 --> 00:56:32.225
so let me just also write
it in terms of components.

00:56:36.810 --> 00:56:43.658
So writing in terms
of components,

00:56:43.658 --> 00:56:50.710
it's 1/2 partial mu, phi
a b, then partial mu,

00:56:50.710 --> 00:57:09.380
phi b a, then plus 1/4 phi a b,
phi b c, phi c a, no-- phi c d,

00:57:09.380 --> 00:57:11.210
phi d a.

00:57:11.210 --> 00:57:14.000
OK.

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:17.320
So this is the just having
writing down explicitly

00:57:17.320 --> 00:57:18.040
using components.

00:57:22.330 --> 00:57:35.670
So this L, by definition,
is invariant under,

00:57:35.670 --> 00:57:38.300
in addition to the
usual translation

00:57:38.300 --> 00:57:46.140
rotation symmetries, et cetera,
has also internal symmetry--

00:57:46.140 --> 00:57:48.860
under UN, global symmetry.

00:57:54.840 --> 00:57:55.620
OK.

00:57:55.620 --> 00:58:04.500
So say phi x goes to
U, phi x u dagger,

00:58:04.500 --> 00:58:13.522
for any u, any
constant, is u N matrix.

00:58:19.060 --> 00:58:21.400
So this series is
invariant under-- so this

00:58:21.400 --> 00:58:25.770
is obvious from here,
because of this trace,

00:58:25.770 --> 00:58:27.751
so this is invariant under this.

00:58:27.751 --> 00:58:28.250
Hm?

00:58:31.180 --> 00:58:33.240
So let me just
make some remarks.

00:58:33.240 --> 00:58:35.770
Before we proceed to talk about
the features of this series,

00:58:35.770 --> 00:58:37.695
let me just make
some quick remarks.

00:58:44.540 --> 00:58:46.170
Zero.

00:58:46.170 --> 00:58:48.005
This is a theory of N
squared scalar field.

00:58:52.600 --> 00:58:53.510
OK.

00:58:53.510 --> 00:58:57.300
So if this is intuitive
to you, then this just

00:58:57.300 --> 00:58:59.530
means you have many, many
fields coupled together

00:58:59.530 --> 00:59:00.540
in some specific way.

00:59:04.440 --> 00:59:09.130
And also we don't have to
consider Hermitian matrices.

00:59:09.130 --> 00:59:11.740
To consider Hermitian
matrices just for simplicity,

00:59:11.740 --> 00:59:20.230
one can also consider
other types of matrices.

00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:31.330
For example, real
symmetric matrices.

00:59:33.970 --> 00:59:38.485
So it's real symmetrical,
anti-symmetric matrices.

00:59:42.040 --> 00:59:46.840
So in those cases, if you
consider, say, real matrices,

00:59:46.840 --> 00:59:49.620
then symmetric or anti-symmetric
matrices, in that case,

00:59:49.620 --> 00:59:56.175
this global symmetry becomes
s o N, rather than u n.

01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:04.580
So in here, this u
is a global symmetry.

01:00:04.580 --> 01:00:07.380
This u has become and
cannot depend on x.

01:00:07.380 --> 01:00:10.390
You see from here, it
cannot depend on x.

01:00:10.390 --> 01:00:26.350
But you can also-- can
also introduce gauge fields

01:00:26.350 --> 01:00:30.088
to make this u n symmetry local.

01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:42.320
So I will not do it
now, but this will be

01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:44.730
important a little bit later.

01:00:44.730 --> 01:00:48.410
So later, we will indeed make
it into a local gauge symmetry.

01:00:48.410 --> 01:00:53.190
But for now, let we just
consider this simple example.

01:00:53.190 --> 01:00:55.648
Because I don't want to
introduce too many fields,

01:00:55.648 --> 01:00:56.148
et cetera.

01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:02.539
So any questions regarding
the setup of this theory?

01:01:02.539 --> 01:01:05.080
AUDIENCE: Yes, can you explain
that last point one more time?

01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:06.853
What do you mean
the-- if you-- how

01:01:06.853 --> 01:01:09.102
does introducing gauge fields
make the symmetry local?

01:01:12.615 --> 01:01:13.240
HONG LIU: Yeah.

01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:19.167
You have to take
8324 to know that.

01:01:19.167 --> 01:01:20.000
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:25.801
HONG LIU: But the simple
way to explain it--

01:01:25.801 --> 01:01:28.130
yeah, there's no simple
way to explain it.

01:01:28.130 --> 01:01:29.364
[LAUGHTER]

01:01:29.364 --> 01:01:31.030
AUDIENCE: I'll draw
the fields, I guess.

01:01:31.030 --> 01:01:31.654
HONG LIU: Yeah.

01:01:31.654 --> 01:01:38.130
Yeah, just say-- let me
just explain the statement.

01:01:38.130 --> 01:01:40.560
If you introduce
some gauge fields,

01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:45.160
then you can make this u to be
some arbitrary function of x,

01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:47.032
rather than a constant.

01:01:47.032 --> 01:01:48.490
So that's the
statement of a local.

01:01:48.490 --> 01:01:49.210
AUDIENCE: That's fine.

01:01:49.210 --> 01:01:50.030
HONG LIU: Yeah.

01:01:50.030 --> 01:01:52.690
Just so I can
generalize this theory,

01:01:52.690 --> 01:01:55.880
so that this symmetry
becomes local--

01:01:55.880 --> 01:01:56.421
AUDIENCE: Ah.

01:01:56.421 --> 01:01:57.260
I see.

01:01:57.260 --> 01:01:59.000
HONG LIU: Becomes a
symmetry so that u

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.350
can have arbitrary x
dependence-- can have

01:02:01.350 --> 01:02:03.510
arbitrary spacetime dependence.

01:02:03.510 --> 01:02:06.577
So right now, u
must be a constant.

01:02:06.577 --> 01:02:07.410
Any other questions?

01:02:12.405 --> 01:02:12.905
Good.

01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:19.660
OK.

01:02:19.660 --> 01:02:25.670
So now, let's just try to
do perturbation theory.

01:02:25.670 --> 01:02:28.150
Think g squared small.

01:02:28.150 --> 01:02:30.240
Try to do perturbation theory.

01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:31.640
OK.

01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:34.164
So the first thing
you do-- of course,

01:02:34.164 --> 01:02:35.830
you should write down
the Feynman rules.

01:02:42.322 --> 01:02:44.530
Say, first thing, you have
to look at the propagator.

01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:52.590
Look at the propagator.

01:02:52.590 --> 01:02:57.880
So you can, essentially-- you
are all field theory experts,

01:02:57.880 --> 01:03:00.610
so just by looking
at that Lagrangian,

01:03:00.610 --> 01:03:03.320
then you can immediately
write down this propagator.

01:03:06.190 --> 01:03:09.470
We can just write
down x minus y.

01:03:09.470 --> 01:03:12.660
So whatever propagator--
whatever spacetime dependence,

01:03:12.660 --> 01:03:15.320
let me just call it x minus y.

01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:18.120
But also there's the
nontrivial index structure.

01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:21.050
First there's also g squared.

01:03:21.050 --> 01:03:21.770
OK.

01:03:21.770 --> 01:03:24.640
Because there's a
prefactor 1/g squared.

01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:26.140
So when you invert
the connection,

01:03:26.140 --> 01:03:28.960
there's a g squared.

01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:33.390
But the index structure
is at a b, b a.

01:03:33.390 --> 01:03:39.080
So that a must contract with
d and b must be the same as c.

01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:45.900
So that means we have
delta a d and delta b c.

01:03:45.900 --> 01:03:48.740
OK.

01:03:48.740 --> 01:03:51.610
Because in the Lagrangian,
only those fields are paired.

01:03:51.610 --> 01:03:55.450
So the propagator must
have this structure.

01:03:55.450 --> 01:03:58.742
So similarly, we
can write down the--

01:03:58.742 --> 01:04:00.700
so there is a four particle
interaction vertex.

01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:08.818
So each particle has two
index, so this is a b,

01:04:08.818 --> 01:04:15.795
c d, e f, oh yeah, right, sorry.

01:04:15.795 --> 01:04:17.150
Let me add one more.

01:04:17.150 --> 01:04:19.240
And then I can denote
this diagramatically just

01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:24.710
as a b c d, OK.

01:04:24.710 --> 01:04:27.090
Just denote this diagramatically
as the propagator,

01:04:27.090 --> 01:04:29.650
which is wavy line a b c d.

01:04:29.650 --> 01:04:31.770
OK.

01:04:31.770 --> 01:04:35.820
And now, also, we have this
quartic interaction vertices,

01:04:35.820 --> 01:04:37.850
which is involving four fields.

01:04:37.850 --> 01:04:42.245
So each field has two index,
because a b, so a b c d, f g h.

01:04:46.002 --> 01:04:47.710
But this is another
arbitrary interaction

01:04:47.710 --> 01:04:48.585
they have contracted.

01:04:48.585 --> 01:04:51.770
In the interaction, they
contract in a specific way.

01:04:51.770 --> 01:04:55.730
So you get 1/g squared
because of [INAUDIBLE] factor

01:04:55.730 --> 01:04:56.660
g squared.

01:04:56.660 --> 01:05:01.560
And then you have
delta b c, delta

01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:07.009
d e, delta f g, delta h a.

01:05:07.009 --> 01:05:08.633
OK, because they have
to be contracted.

01:05:11.710 --> 01:05:14.910
Better to write it as
a b, this way. a b.

01:05:14.910 --> 01:05:15.750
OK.

01:05:15.750 --> 01:05:19.715
So a b, b contracted with
c, d contracted with e, e

01:05:19.715 --> 01:05:22.090
contracted with g, h contracted
with a, so this gives you

01:05:22.090 --> 01:05:23.840
a matrix product.

01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:25.624
So just like that, OK.

01:05:25.624 --> 01:05:27.540
AUDIENCE: So it doesn't
propagate or anything.

01:05:27.540 --> 01:05:28.659
It just changes a and b.

01:05:28.659 --> 01:05:29.200
HONG LIU: Hm?

01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:32.610
a b

01:05:32.610 --> 01:05:34.035
AUDIENCE: --contracted with d.

01:05:34.035 --> 01:05:34.660
HONG LIU: Yeah.

01:05:34.660 --> 01:05:35.826
Let me just [INAUDIBLE] d c.

01:05:35.826 --> 01:05:36.619
That's right.

01:05:36.619 --> 01:05:37.119
OK.

01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:43.081
So this is a Feynman rule.

01:05:43.081 --> 01:05:44.455
So now you can
start calculating.

01:05:47.790 --> 01:05:50.354
So if you have calculated
this for a while,

01:05:50.354 --> 01:05:52.145
then you find this is
a little bit tedious.

01:05:52.145 --> 01:05:54.440
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:59.540
HONG LIU: With all these
indices, it's quite annoying.

01:05:59.540 --> 01:06:04.720
But t' Hooft was a smart fellow.

01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:07.540
He said, let me find a way
so that I don't have to keep

01:06:07.540 --> 01:06:10.760
track of all these indices.

01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:12.846
Then he invented
a very nice way.

01:06:12.846 --> 01:06:14.470
So this is called
double line notation.

01:06:24.450 --> 01:06:33.470
So first, this
propagator a b c d,

01:06:33.470 --> 01:06:36.610
since that a is
contracted with c, c

01:06:36.610 --> 01:06:39.040
is contracted with b
separately, he said,

01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:40.680
let's just write it
as a double line.

01:06:43.460 --> 01:06:46.700
But since there's a difference
between the upper the lower

01:06:46.700 --> 01:06:51.440
indices, so let's define a
direction for this double line.

01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:54.060
So let's define the direction
to go from the upper index

01:06:54.060 --> 01:06:55.660
to the lower index.

01:06:55.660 --> 01:07:00.690
Then you will have a b,
then you have d, then c b.

01:07:00.690 --> 01:07:04.810
Because for c, is upper to
lower index, to go from c d.

01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:16.180
So now you don't have to worry
about this thing anymore,

01:07:16.180 --> 01:07:19.820
because it's automatically
taken care of by this notation.

01:07:19.820 --> 01:07:26.800
Similarly, this one is
also automatically taken

01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:35.050
care of because each one, if you
replace it, by the double line

01:07:35.050 --> 01:07:43.190
notation, then you
just make it a,

01:07:43.190 --> 01:07:47.980
b, then b is equal to c, b equal
to it here, c equal to c, d

01:07:47.980 --> 01:07:52.660
equal to d, and a to a.

01:07:52.660 --> 01:07:57.240
And then we have g squared,
here you have g squared.

01:08:00.940 --> 01:08:03.690
So once you do all the
double line notation-- so

01:08:03.690 --> 01:08:15.040
let me also draw the arrow--
once you have double line

01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:21.410
notation, then all of
those annoying deltas,

01:08:21.410 --> 01:08:22.921
they're automatically
taken care of.

01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:30.068
AUDIENCE: On the left,
that side, [INAUDIBLE]

01:08:30.068 --> 01:08:30.609
HONG LIU: Hm?

01:08:30.609 --> 01:08:33.386
AUDIENCE: c is on the top of d.

01:08:33.386 --> 01:08:34.510
HONG LIU: Sorry, which one?

01:08:34.510 --> 01:08:36.995
AUDIENCE: That [INAUDIBLE]

01:08:36.995 --> 01:08:37.620
HONG LIU: Here?

01:08:37.620 --> 01:08:39.840
AUDIENCE: Yes, c is on the top.

01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:41.359
HONG LIU: That--

01:08:41.359 --> 01:08:43.472
AUDIENCE: Yeah, if
we write [INAUDIBLE]

01:08:43.472 --> 01:08:44.013
HONG LIU: Oh.

01:08:44.013 --> 01:08:45.605
OK.

01:08:45.605 --> 01:08:46.520
delta b c.

01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:48.520
That's right.

01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:49.520
b c.

01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:52.420
Good.

01:08:52.420 --> 01:08:52.919
Good.

01:08:52.919 --> 01:08:55.550
Good.

01:08:55.550 --> 01:08:58.609
So now let us give you some
examples of using this diagram

01:08:58.609 --> 01:09:01.399
to calculate things.

01:09:01.399 --> 01:09:03.479
And also try to calculate
the independents.

01:09:03.479 --> 01:09:06.439
Because eventually we want
to take a large N limit.

01:09:06.439 --> 01:09:06.941
OK.

01:09:06.941 --> 01:09:08.815
So we want to keep track
of the independents.

01:09:17.370 --> 01:09:18.340
HONG LIU: Yes?

01:09:18.340 --> 01:09:20.034
AUDIENCE: The four
point coupling?

01:09:20.034 --> 01:09:23.090
Does that come from the
commutator in the f [INAUDIBLE]

01:09:23.090 --> 01:09:24.495
in the gauge theory?

01:09:24.495 --> 01:09:26.370
HONG LIU: No, I just
wrote it down by myself.

01:09:26.370 --> 01:09:28.200
AUDIENCE: OK, so it's
an additional thing.

01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:28.529
HONG LIU: Yeah.

01:09:28.529 --> 01:09:28.880
Yeah.

01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:29.880
AUDIENCE: So [INAUDIBLE]

01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:31.600
HONG LIU: It's actually-- yeah.

01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:33.968
Just arbitrary field theory.

01:09:33.968 --> 01:09:34.634
Just an example.

01:09:37.529 --> 01:09:38.029
OK.

01:09:38.029 --> 01:09:42.029
So now let's start calculating.

01:09:42.029 --> 01:09:44.709
You already have
the Feynman rule.

01:09:44.709 --> 01:09:45.750
What are you waiting for?

01:09:45.750 --> 01:09:46.224
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

01:09:46.224 --> 01:09:47.172
HONG LIU: Haha.

01:09:47.172 --> 01:09:50.970
So let's just calculate.

01:09:50.970 --> 01:09:55.750
So the first thing, let's
look at the vacuum energy.

01:09:55.750 --> 01:09:59.440
So that's the first
thing to calculate.

01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:02.140
So what's the vacuum energy?

01:10:02.140 --> 01:10:05.577
The vacuum energy
is all the diagrams.

01:10:05.577 --> 01:10:07.910
It's a summation of all of
the diagrams without external

01:10:07.910 --> 01:10:08.450
[INAUDIBLE].

01:10:08.450 --> 01:10:08.950
OK.

01:10:15.850 --> 01:10:22.017
So the simplest diagram
is just with one vertex.

01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:28.260
OK.

01:10:28.260 --> 01:10:30.220
So this is the simplest diagram.

01:10:33.650 --> 01:10:37.830
But now, so if you
do lambda 5 4 theory,

01:10:37.830 --> 01:10:40.430
then that will be
the end of the story.

01:10:40.430 --> 01:10:42.410
OK.

01:10:42.410 --> 01:10:44.440
You just contract them.

01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:51.920
But now, the matrix, because
we have contracting matrices,

01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:55.000
so this is like contracting
to four matrices.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.060
When you're contracting
matrices-- but matrices

01:10:57.060 --> 01:10:58.770
don't commute.

01:10:58.770 --> 01:11:01.750
So actually there's
a difference.

01:11:01.750 --> 01:11:12.740
So you should convince
yourself there's

01:11:12.740 --> 01:11:14.690
a difference which
I actually connect

01:11:14.690 --> 01:11:23.070
these two from which I connect
these two and these two.

01:11:23.070 --> 01:11:24.777
OK.

01:11:24.777 --> 01:11:27.360
Because this corresponding to I
connect with neighboring ones.

01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:30.100
And this one I connect
with diagonal ones.

01:11:30.100 --> 01:11:32.740
And the order actually matters.

01:11:32.740 --> 01:11:34.380
The order actually matters.

01:11:34.380 --> 01:11:37.356
Because matrices don't commute.

01:11:37.356 --> 01:11:46.807
So if I call this a and the
b, and a not equal to b.

01:11:46.807 --> 01:11:48.265
Because the matrices
don't commute.

01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:55.880
So now let's do the N counting.

01:11:55.880 --> 01:11:57.880
So to do the N counting
is actually much simpler

01:11:57.880 --> 01:12:00.400
if we use the double
line notation.

01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:02.810
So let's now use the
double line notation.

01:12:02.810 --> 01:12:06.990
Because all these N, so when
you do the contractions,

01:12:06.990 --> 01:12:11.270
you have all these indices, you
sum all those indices-- when

01:12:11.270 --> 01:12:13.710
you sum all those indices, you
will get some factors of N.

01:12:13.710 --> 01:12:18.560
So that's how N will
come into this theory.

01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:23.849
But double line notation makes
the constraint all manifest,

01:12:23.849 --> 01:12:25.390
so the contraction
will be automatic.

01:12:25.390 --> 01:12:28.940
You don't have to worry
about all those deltas.

01:12:28.940 --> 01:12:31.954
So let's just do that.

01:12:31.954 --> 01:12:33.370
Let's draw this
four point vertex.

01:12:36.590 --> 01:12:39.430
For this one, we just
contract the neighboring ones.

01:12:42.420 --> 01:12:44.310
For this one, we
do the same thing.

01:12:51.810 --> 01:12:55.384
We contract the
neighboring ones.

01:13:01.390 --> 01:13:01.890
Yeah.

01:13:01.890 --> 01:13:03.180
I did not draw very well.

01:13:03.180 --> 01:13:06.496
Let me--

01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:18.280
OK.

01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:22.910
So this one should be
contracted with this one.

01:13:22.910 --> 01:13:26.870
This one should be
contracted with that one.

01:13:26.870 --> 01:13:31.620
And this one contract with
this one, and this one

01:13:31.620 --> 01:13:32.730
is contracted there.

01:13:32.730 --> 01:13:34.220
OK.

01:13:34.220 --> 01:13:37.720
There's some intersection.

01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:39.250
So now let's come to the end.

01:13:43.870 --> 01:13:45.055
So now here is the key.

01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:54.370
Each loop corresponding
to a contracted indices.

01:13:54.370 --> 01:13:59.460
So for example, in here,
this is already a and a.

01:13:59.460 --> 01:14:02.560
And then if you contract these
two, then you sum over this a

01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:04.320
when you calculate
the propagator.

01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:06.760
And then that gives
you a factor of n.

01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:09.630
So each contract, each
closed loop, essentially

01:14:09.630 --> 01:14:12.550
gives you a factor of n.

01:14:12.550 --> 01:14:15.660
Just because you
contract-- yeah.

01:14:15.660 --> 01:14:17.570
So there are three loops here.

01:14:17.570 --> 01:14:19.190
Three contracted loops.

01:14:19.190 --> 01:14:20.493
So this gives you n cubed.

01:14:23.660 --> 01:14:26.940
And if you look at the
g squared dependence,

01:14:26.940 --> 01:14:30.050
so you have two
propagators here.

01:14:30.050 --> 01:14:31.570
You have two propagators.

01:14:31.570 --> 01:14:33.370
Each propagator gives
you a g squared.

01:14:33.370 --> 01:14:35.750
Then you have one vertex.

01:14:35.750 --> 01:14:40.710
Each vertex gives you 1/g
squared, so you have g squared.

01:14:40.710 --> 01:14:43.140
OK.

01:14:43.140 --> 01:14:46.090
So now let's look at this one.

01:14:46.090 --> 01:14:48.030
This one, this says
follow this line-- oh, you

01:14:48.030 --> 01:14:49.904
should also draw the
arrow, because the arrow

01:14:49.904 --> 01:14:52.370
should follow.

01:14:52.370 --> 01:14:55.200
I did not draw the arrow,
but arrows should all follow.

01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:04.880
The arrow should be consistent.

01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:06.590
Similarly, here.

01:15:06.590 --> 01:15:08.270
So here, if you go
around, you find

01:15:08.270 --> 01:15:12.150
there is only a single
contracted line.

01:15:12.150 --> 01:15:14.620
So this, only a factor of n.

01:15:14.620 --> 01:15:16.860
Of course, g squared
dependency is the same.

01:15:16.860 --> 01:15:19.279
So you have g squared.

01:15:19.279 --> 01:15:20.820
So now you already
see the difference

01:15:20.820 --> 01:15:22.285
between these two diagrams.

01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:28.490
One is proportionate to n, one
is proportionate to n cubed.

01:15:33.190 --> 01:15:45.095
So a, diagram a, can be drawn
on the plane-- we are drawing it

01:15:45.095 --> 01:15:56.700
on the plane without
crossing lines,

01:15:56.700 --> 01:15:58.420
so we call it a planar diagram.

01:16:05.270 --> 01:16:12.520
And b cannot be drawn on the
plane without crossing lines,

01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:15.432
so we call it a
non-planar diagram.

01:16:24.110 --> 01:16:26.807
So let's do one more step.

01:16:26.807 --> 01:16:28.015
So let's do one more diagram.

01:16:39.100 --> 01:16:40.320
So let's do one more diagram.

01:16:46.750 --> 01:16:54.760
So next order, you just get
two, next order [INAUDIBLE]

01:16:54.760 --> 01:17:01.630
diagram without [INAUDIBLE]
you have two vertices.

01:17:01.630 --> 01:17:03.260
OK.

01:17:03.260 --> 01:17:04.450
So you can connect this way.

01:17:08.250 --> 01:17:10.230
So this is one diagram.

01:17:10.230 --> 01:17:14.152
You can also have a
non-planar diagram-- yeah,

01:17:14.152 --> 01:17:16.110
let me just draw the
straight line, rather than

01:17:16.110 --> 01:17:20.480
the wavy line, just
to save trouble.

01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:23.000
You can, for example,
you can draw like this,

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:24.560
so this is a non-planar diagram.

01:17:29.190 --> 01:17:35.090
So now I'll give you an
exercise today when you go home.

01:17:35.090 --> 01:17:39.760
Turn those into
double line diagrams.

01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:42.800
Then you should find
yourself that this

01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:45.375
is n to the power of 4.

01:17:45.375 --> 01:17:45.875
Yeah.

01:17:45.875 --> 01:17:46.833
Maybe I should do this.

01:17:49.630 --> 01:17:52.960
Yeah, let me do
this one for you.

01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:55.156
So let me just do this
one quickly for you.

01:18:03.870 --> 01:18:06.900
But I will not draw the
arrows, just to save time.

01:18:22.380 --> 01:18:27.390
So this one, you count
how many contracted lines?

01:18:27.390 --> 01:18:31.460
One, two, three, four, so
this gives you n to the 4th

01:18:31.460 --> 01:18:34.500
for the area.

01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:36.410
And this I will not do it now.

01:18:36.410 --> 01:18:38.100
You do it yourself.

01:18:38.100 --> 01:18:40.220
So, also, if you count
the g dependents,

01:18:40.220 --> 01:18:42.820
this gives you g
to the power of 4.

01:18:42.820 --> 01:18:50.600
And this gives you n
squared, g to the power of 4.

01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:51.910
Is it g to the power of 4?

01:18:51.910 --> 01:18:53.730
Maybe I'm counting wrong.

01:18:53.730 --> 01:18:54.946
One, two, three, four.

01:18:54.946 --> 01:18:57.490
Four propagators is g squared.

01:18:57.490 --> 01:18:58.610
Yeah. g to the power of 4.

01:18:58.610 --> 01:19:01.430
Yeah.

01:19:01.430 --> 01:19:01.970
Yes?

01:19:01.970 --> 01:19:05.060
AUDIENCE: So in general, the
more-- the more crossings,

01:19:05.060 --> 01:19:06.000
would that decrease n?

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:09.010
HONG LIU: Yeah, that's right.

01:19:09.010 --> 01:19:10.420
OK.

01:19:10.420 --> 01:19:12.950
So now you can just continue.

01:19:12.950 --> 01:19:17.210
With three vertices, with
four vertices, et cetera.

01:19:17.210 --> 01:19:22.500
But of course, the smart fellows
will not stop, and they ask,

01:19:22.500 --> 01:19:25.950
can I find some
rules in doing this?

01:19:25.950 --> 01:19:30.180
So, how do you get the
general n counting?

01:19:30.180 --> 01:19:34.340
And whether that's the old
planar diagram with the same,

01:19:34.340 --> 01:19:37.120
or does one need to
classify them further?

01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:37.710
OK.

01:19:37.710 --> 01:19:39.870
So these are the
obvious questions.

01:19:39.870 --> 01:19:42.740
So let me just tell
you some observations.

01:19:42.740 --> 01:19:46.656
Then we are closed for today.

01:19:46.656 --> 01:19:48.370
Then we will close for today.

01:19:52.550 --> 01:19:53.690
So the first observation.

01:19:59.534 --> 01:20:02.200
So just from those examples, let
me just draw some observations.

01:20:06.770 --> 01:20:14.209
Observation one-- so this
one requires a little bit

01:20:14.209 --> 01:20:14.750
of ingenuity.

01:20:18.655 --> 01:20:24.400
It says, even a and
b-- so this a and b--

01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:28.130
they cannot be
drawn on the plane.

01:20:28.130 --> 01:20:33.700
They cannot be drawn on the
plane without crossing lines.

01:20:33.700 --> 01:20:47.080
But a and b can be drawn on a
torus without crossing lines.

01:20:57.180 --> 01:21:01.390
So now let me show it to you.

01:21:01.390 --> 01:21:04.270
So what is a torus?

01:21:04.270 --> 01:21:07.380
So we can draw a torus on
the plane, like follows,

01:21:07.380 --> 01:21:08.960
so we draw a square.

01:21:08.960 --> 01:21:12.000
Then we identify this
side with that side.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.730
Identify this side
with that side.

01:21:14.730 --> 01:21:16.460
Then this gives us a torus.

01:21:16.460 --> 01:21:18.060
OK.

01:21:18.060 --> 01:21:22.722
Because when you do that,
that give you cylinder.

01:21:22.722 --> 01:21:24.930
And then you do that again,
and it gives you a torus.

01:21:27.780 --> 01:21:32.170
But on the plane, just
simple identification.

01:21:32.170 --> 01:21:34.720
So let's try to
see this diagram.

01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:38.160
Now let me show this diagram
can be drawn on the torus

01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:41.865
without crossing, because
the vertex is like this.

01:21:45.110 --> 01:21:47.990
We want to contract with this
guy with that guy, and that guy

01:21:47.990 --> 01:21:49.520
with that guy, right?

01:21:49.520 --> 01:21:51.060
Not labeling lines.

01:21:51.060 --> 01:21:54.550
But now I can just go up.

01:21:54.550 --> 01:21:56.330
Now this is
identified with here,

01:21:56.330 --> 01:21:58.230
then I can come back here.

01:21:58.230 --> 01:22:01.590
Can go here, come back here.

01:22:01.590 --> 01:22:03.200
So this is contracted.

01:22:03.200 --> 01:22:07.370
And I don't have to cross lines.

01:22:07.370 --> 01:22:08.780
Yes?

01:22:08.780 --> 01:22:09.280
Good.

01:22:09.280 --> 01:22:12.880
Similarly, let me do that one.

01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:16.090
Yeah, that one, maybe I
will let you do yourself.

01:22:16.090 --> 01:22:20.020
Yeah, do the-- so this a--
no, this is not a and b.

01:22:20.020 --> 01:22:22.440
This is b and d.

01:22:22.440 --> 01:22:29.380
Let me call this-- b, this
is-- let me call it c and d.

01:22:29.380 --> 01:22:32.870
So a and c are
planar diagrams and b

01:22:32.870 --> 01:22:35.020
and d are non-planar diagrams.

01:22:35.020 --> 01:22:37.360
OK.

01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:40.070
So this is b.

01:22:40.070 --> 01:22:43.045
So try to do it yourself, the d.

01:22:43.045 --> 01:22:44.670
So you essentially
you have two vertex.

01:22:47.720 --> 01:22:49.450
How to make that
non-planar diagram

01:22:49.450 --> 01:22:53.920
to be planar on this torus
when you identify here

01:22:53.920 --> 01:22:56.200
with there, and
there with there?

01:22:56.200 --> 01:22:56.700
OK.

01:22:56.700 --> 01:22:57.930
So this observation one.

01:23:00.791 --> 01:23:02.290
Actually, let me
just do it for you.

01:23:02.290 --> 01:23:03.686
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

01:23:03.686 --> 01:23:05.060
HONG LIU: So we
connect because I

01:23:05.060 --> 01:23:09.680
need to do-- because it's
better I have this example

01:23:09.680 --> 01:23:13.550
to make my second point.

01:23:13.550 --> 01:23:16.420
So now I need to connect
this to that guy,

01:23:16.420 --> 01:23:21.012
but I can do it by going up.

01:23:21.012 --> 01:23:23.160
I can-- this guy can go here.

01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:24.130
And then go there.

01:23:24.130 --> 01:23:25.870
Similar thing, OK.

01:23:25.870 --> 01:23:30.750
And then this is-- I can connect
them without crossing lines.

01:23:30.750 --> 01:23:34.100
So this is observation one.

01:23:34.100 --> 01:23:40.850
So now, observation two, again,
is a little bit ingenious,

01:23:40.850 --> 01:23:46.936
but maybe slightly easier if
you have done it long enough.

01:23:51.900 --> 01:23:57.410
For all the a to d, the
Fourier rule is true.

01:23:57.410 --> 01:24:08.390
The power of n is equal
to number of faces.

01:24:08.390 --> 01:24:14.000
So this one, we call-- so even
though they cannot be crossed,

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:17.510
they cross nice on the plane,
but we can actually straighten

01:24:17.510 --> 01:24:18.860
them out on the torus.

01:24:18.860 --> 01:24:19.760
OK.

01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:23.090
So here we can straighten
them out on the torus.

01:24:23.090 --> 01:24:24.940
So the second [INAUDIBLE]
is a power of n,

01:24:24.940 --> 01:24:28.525
it's the number of
faces in each diagram.

01:24:32.810 --> 01:24:36.990
After we straighten it out.

01:24:46.911 --> 01:24:47.410
OK.

01:24:47.410 --> 01:24:48.855
First, let's look
at this diagram.

01:24:51.460 --> 01:24:53.490
This is a planar diagram.

01:24:53.490 --> 01:24:55.570
So there's one face.

01:24:55.570 --> 01:24:57.096
There's two faces.

01:24:57.096 --> 01:24:59.720
And then there's a face outside,
because there's a whole plane.

01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:01.240
So there's three faces.

01:25:01.240 --> 01:25:04.380
So this is n cubed.

01:25:04.380 --> 01:25:10.640
And the b, on the torus,
there's only one face,

01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:13.500
because each region is
connected to each other.

01:25:13.500 --> 01:25:14.359
OK.

01:25:14.359 --> 01:25:15.400
So there's only one face.

01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:17.900
You see the power n.

01:25:17.900 --> 01:25:22.370
So now you see you had one
face, you have two faces,

01:25:22.370 --> 01:25:24.380
we have three faces,
we have four faces,

01:25:24.380 --> 01:25:27.730
so this is n to the power of 4.

01:25:27.730 --> 01:25:32.060
And for this one, you have one
face corresponding to here.

01:25:34.690 --> 01:25:38.150
And then you easily
convince yourself everything

01:25:38.150 --> 01:25:40.460
outside this region,
they're connected

01:25:40.460 --> 01:25:44.541
through the identification,
so you get n squared.

01:25:44.541 --> 01:25:45.040
OK.

01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:47.140
Then n squared.

01:25:47.140 --> 01:25:49.010
So there's two observations.

01:25:49.010 --> 01:25:51.110
So let me stop here.

01:25:51.110 --> 01:25:54.380
And then, from here, you can
figure out the general rules

01:25:54.380 --> 01:25:55.650
for everything.

01:26:03.660 --> 01:26:05.210
[APPLAUSE]
