00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.470
HONG LIU: OK let's start.

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.790
So let me just
mention brief-- first

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:29.250
let me just mention briefly,
this story regarding

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.740
the D-brane and the
Higgs mechanism,

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.950
which we discussed at
the end of last lecture.

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.740
So there was a P-set problem
which was related to this.

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.770
Yes, I expected maybe the
P-set problem was a little bit

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.700
tough because we did
not go to many details.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.225
We did not go to many details.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:03.459
Yeah, so in grading we will
be very flexible because we--

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:05.459
So let me just say a few
more things about that,

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:06.885
just to make sure--

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.020
So here is the action.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.900
If you have n-- say
if you supposedly

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.884
have N D-branes together--
and then in such case--

00:01:20.884 --> 00:01:22.300
so this is a low
energy defractive

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.690
action for the massless
degree of freedom

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.450
on the D-brane for which you
have a gauge field, which

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.690
is a matrix, and then
you also have a scalar

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.130
field, a number
of scalar fields,

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.500
which are also n-by-n matrices.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.990
And the number of
scalar fields is

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.050
the same as the number
of transverse dimensions.

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:46.430
And then we also discussed
that the scalar fields

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.030
can be considered as describing
the transverse dynamics

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.280
of the brain.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.400
Say, let's consider
you have-- let's

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.339
consider you have a single
brane and there's only

00:01:59.339 --> 00:02:00.380
one transverse direction.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.590
Say let's call it
the phi direction.

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.070
There's only one direction,
say phi 1 direction.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.420
Then essentially the location
of the brane then essentially

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.500
the expectation
value of phi 1 can

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.660
be considered-- say suppose
this is the direction of x1,

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.030
and the corresponding
scalar field is phi 1.

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.420
And then the expectation
value of phi 1

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.340
can be considered
as the location

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.880
of the brane and this
phi is the string which

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.835
ending on this brain
and come back to itself.

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.680
So now let's consider if you
have two branes-- now consider

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.370
you have n-branes-- again, b is
only one transverse direction.

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.740
I now have n-branes with
one transverse direction,

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.030
which again is x1.

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.584
And now you can
just separate them.

00:02:54.584 --> 00:02:56.750
So now let's consider the
process which you separate

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:02.310
these n-branes into-- say
completely separate them

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.830
in different locations.

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.450
So this is x1, x2, to xn.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.570
So this situation can be
considered as a situation.

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.703
So in this case,
the phi is the-- phi

00:03:20.703 --> 00:03:22.930
is the m-by-n matrices.

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.780
And then this can be considered
as phi having an expectation

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:36.930
value which is only
in the diagonal entry,

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.090
and each that diagonal
entry describes

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.400
the location of each D-brane.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.880
And it's natural
to think that why

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.700
this is the diagonal entry
because the diagonal entry

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.480
describes the string, which
ending on the brane itself.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.650
So this is a one-one
string, and this is

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.970
a two-two string, and n-string.

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.560
And so the diagonal
string is the excitation

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.857
on the brane itself.

00:04:02.857 --> 00:04:04.440
And the off-diagonal
degree of freedom

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.160
corresponding to, essentially
corresponding to the excitation

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.519
between the string
between the branes.

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:11.060
And so it's natural
that the location

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.090
of the branes, and
then just corresponding

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.779
to the diagonal entries.

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:23.680
And so now we can generalize
to the general dimensions.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:29.660
Now suppose there are two
transverse dimensions--

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.300
let me call them x1
and x2-- and then

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.950
now you have two scalar fields.

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:39.840
So now the story is a
little bit more complicated

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.060
because when you have two
transverse directions,

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.226
say if you have more than
two transverse directions,

00:04:44.226 --> 00:04:47.320
now you have nontrivial
potential term.

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.870
And under the law of
the configuration,

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.580
say suppose it's five, have
low space time-dependent

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:58.571
on the law of configuration, say
the minimum with the potential,

00:04:58.571 --> 00:05:00.570
the mass was corresponding
to the configuration,

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.320
which the commutative phi
a and phi b to be zero.

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:11.000
Right now, say we have
two transverse directions,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.480
so we only have two, but you
can generalize to any number

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.070
of transverse directions.

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:22.100
So that means that
the phi, or the phi

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:23.670
equals 1, or the
scalar field, they

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:25.045
have to converge
with each other.

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:31.420
That means they can be
simultaneously diagonalized.

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:34.840
That means they
simultaneously diagonalized.

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:41.190
That means we can choose
a basis, say if I write

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:50.880
the phi, the collection
of all the D-branes,

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.110
then I can simultaneously
diagonalize them, and then

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:56.140
have the following form.

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.070
So each x1 goes one into--
so each vector goes one

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:08.810
into-- for example
here, is x1-- I should

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:13.940
use a different notation, so let
me call the spacetime y1, y2--

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:17.950
and say this is x2, et cetera.

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:19.640
So this defines
the configuration,

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:21.940
which you have one D-brane
here and one D-brane

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:26.990
at this point, and
at x3, and et cetera.

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:30.360
And again, it's only
the diagonal entry

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.595
that describes the
location of the D-branes.

00:06:33.595 --> 00:06:35.970
The diagonal entry describe
the location of the D-branes.

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:41.227
And these, because they are
all diagonal and the commutator

00:06:41.227 --> 00:06:43.435
is zero, and these are the
law of the configurations.

00:06:46.902 --> 00:06:48.360
So this is a very
important lesson.

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:52.590
It tells you that even you have
a potential, still the D-brane,

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:54.780
you can put it
anywhere you want.

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:57.220
And you have the freedom
to put the D-brane-- you

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:58.620
don't break translations image.

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:04.510
Any questions on this?

00:07:14.926 --> 00:07:21.110
Of course when you say, when
the scalar field develops

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:24.360
expectation value and then your
original un gauge symmetry's

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:29.070
broken, and then
broken into the just

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:32.790
in the standard
story to whatever

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:35.700
[INAUDIBLE] group
allowed by this--

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:41.470
so if all the x1-- if all
of them are different,

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:44.440
then the remaining just
be 1 to the power n.

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:46.950
Because now you just have
each brane separated,

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:49.062
then you just have
1 to the power n.

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:55.280
Good?

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:03.680
So not let's move to new stuff.

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:06.000
So now let's say I little
bit about the D-branes

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.740
in super string theory.

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:09.700
So what we said so
far actually applies

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:13.200
to D-branes in bosonic
string and in superstring.

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:17.960
Now let's say a little bit
more above the D-branes.

00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:34.970
So as we discussed before, when
we quantized the open string,

00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:47.200
the D-branes in
bosonic string always

00:08:47.200 --> 00:09:02.010
have a tachyon-- always
have open string tachyon,

00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:06.430
no matter what D-brane you have
because as we discussed before,

00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:08.720
the quantization, the
zero-point energy on the string

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:11.680
is the same no matter which
dimension of the brane

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:12.819
is et cetera.

00:09:12.819 --> 00:09:14.610
And so you always have
open string tachyon.

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:24.450
So that means, as we
said before, tachyon

00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:30.953
means that you are seeking-- if
you have a scalar field which

00:09:30.953 --> 00:09:34.730
have a negative mass squared,
that means you're essentially

00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:37.245
sitting at the top of the
potential-- in the top

00:09:37.245 --> 00:09:39.130
of some potential.

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:42.220
And so that's why you get
the negative mass squared.

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:43.852
And so that means
you have-- this

00:09:43.852 --> 00:09:45.060
is an unstable configuration.

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:54.190
Because if you, say, give the
tachyon a little bit back,

00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:56.447
then the tachyon
want to roll down,

00:09:56.447 --> 00:09:58.405
and then you move away
from this configuration.

00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:05.600
You move away from
this configuration.

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:17.240
So when you go to superstring--
so we also discussed before,

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:20.940
for the bosonic string, the
close string factor also

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:24.790
has a tachyon, and then you
can get rid of those tachyons

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:27.540
by going to the superstring.

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:35.010
So similarly, going into the
superstring, the D-branes

00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:42.250
of certain dimensions--
not for all dimensions,

00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:46.900
but only for some dimensions--
do not have tachyons.

00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:55.850
So they are stable.

00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:03.604
So their lowest modes
are just massless modes.

00:11:03.604 --> 00:11:05.395
They don't have negative
mass square modes.

00:11:15.246 --> 00:11:21.120
In particular-- so this I
will-- this is a long story.

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:24.660
This is a somewhat long story
which I will not explain here,

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:27.450
but I will just
make the statement.

00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:32.630
In particular you can show
that for those stable D-branes

00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:36.040
in superstring, they always
carry a conserved charge.

00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:48.080
So I will explain where does
this conserved charge come

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:51.730
from, and they always carry
some conserved charged.

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:54.920
And which is also a reason
why they are stable.

00:11:54.920 --> 00:12:05.270
And the second feature is
that the worldvolume theory

00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:06.020
is supersymmetric.

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:19.860
So in addition to this
phi-- so in addition to this

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:34.880
say A alpha phi we are looking
at here, A alpha and phi a,

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:37.407
which we already see
in the bosonic string,

00:12:37.407 --> 00:12:38.740
they are also massless fermions.

00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:49.120
So the open string excitations
also include massless fermions.

00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:55.000
They also include
massless fermions.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.180
And in particular, the
low energy theories,

00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:02.920
all of them together, is the
supersymmetric version of this.

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:05.621
It's a super-Yang-Mills theory,
supersymmetric version of this.

00:13:05.621 --> 00:13:07.537
And it's some kind of
super-Yang-Mills theory.

00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:27.810
So now let me elaborate a
little bit on the first point.

00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:31.210
They carry a conserved charged.

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:33.560
Let me elaborate a little
bit on the first point.

00:13:37.612 --> 00:13:41.800
So maybe go to the one,
elaborate more on one.

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:51.890
So let me just remind you
again, the bosonic part of the

00:13:51.890 --> 00:14:03.170
of massless closed
superstring spectrum,

00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:09.110
which we briefly
mentioned before--

00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:12.700
so this is so-called type
II string, so-called type II

00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:13.200
string.

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:15.533
When I say the superstring I
always mean type II string.

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:26.460
So if you quantize
the superstring,

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:31.260
then you find that they are
again, you find the metric,

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.540
you find the graviton,
then you find

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:35.760
that there are
this metric tensor,

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:38.320
and you find that there
are scalar fields just

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:42.080
as what we did in
the bosonic string.

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:46.990
But they have some
additional massless modes.

00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:49.020
Depending on your
quantization or how

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:52.730
you treat the fermions in the
superstring, then there can be,

00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:57.970
say IIA or IIB, there are
two types of superstring.

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:04.810
And for IIA you have one
additional 1-form field

00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:06.490
and additional 3-form field.

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:16.880
And for IIB, you have
additional scalar fields,

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:21.290
and additional 2-form fields,
and additional 4-form fields.

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:34.690
In particular, this is
so-called self-dual.

00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:37.260
I will explain that
in a little bit.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.100
In the IIB, contain
a self-dual 4-form.

00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:47.590
And this additional field are
called the Ramond-Ramond field,

00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:48.420
typically.

00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:51.836
Just a name, it's called
the Ramond-Ramond fields.

00:15:51.836 --> 00:15:56.048
And so this called the
Ramond-Ramond fields.

00:15:56.048 --> 00:15:58.800
AUDIENCE: C1 and C3?

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:00.450
HONG LIU: C1 and
C3, that's right.

00:16:00.450 --> 00:16:02.320
They're all called
Ramond-Ramond fields.

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:02.820
Yeah.

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:09.060
So the story is
essentially the same,

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:13.290
very similar as to what we
did for the bosonic string.

00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:17.270
For the bosonic string you
only have x on one sheet,

00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:19.850
when you quantize x then
you find the graviton,

00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:23.860
you find those B, you find the
phi, and in the superstring

00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:26.380
you pull some additional
fermions on the world-sheets,

00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:28.580
and those fermions give
you additional modes,

00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:32.920
and then you will have those
additional-- they will also

00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:37.390
give rise to additional
massless modes in the spacetime,

00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:39.830
and those are this
Ramond-Ramond fields.

00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:45.870
They are also massless fermions,
which I will not write here.

00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:46.650
Yes?

00:16:46.650 --> 00:16:50.450
AUDIENCE: So why is it that type
IIA and type IIB string theory,

00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:53.840
they appear to be very, very
different, which seems bad.

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:56.256
It just seems like there's
this arbitrary choice about how

00:16:56.256 --> 00:16:57.672
you go about doing
the mathematics

00:16:57.672 --> 00:17:00.370
and you get this spectrum of
particles or this spectrum.

00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:04.384
So who do you get
around this problem?

00:17:04.384 --> 00:17:05.800
HONG LIU: This is
not the problem.

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:06.829
This is a fact of life.

00:17:09.339 --> 00:17:12.369
This is just what you find.

00:17:12.369 --> 00:17:13.700
This is just what you find.

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:15.108
AUDIENCE: So which one is right?

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:25.430
HONG LIU: They
both can be right,

00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:27.300
and they both can be wrong.

00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:33.840
And our goal is just to find
all possible theories are there.

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:37.020
And this just allow
the quantizations.

00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:40.830
A lot consists in
the quantizations.

00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:45.920
And both of them give you
consistent quantum gravity.

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:51.890
And if I have time, if this is
a string theory class, if this

00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:53.840
were a string
theory class, then I

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:59.452
would explain that actually
secretly they are equivalent,

00:17:59.452 --> 00:18:00.660
secretly they are equivalent.

00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:06.090
So in some sense, they
are not that different.

00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:17.170
Anyway, for your purpose,
at the perturbative level,

00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:20.320
when we can see that the
string coupling to be small,

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:24.060
then they appear
to be different,

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:28.100
and yeah, we have two
types of strings here.

00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:32.550
And so let me mention a
little bit about those forms.

00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:36.050
All of these are
anti-symmetric potentials,

00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:48.310
so these anti-symmetric
potentials

00:18:48.310 --> 00:19:05.880
are generalizations of the
Maxwell fields, of the Maxwell

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:06.590
field A mu.

00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:13.110
So mathematically, you can
write-- say for example,

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:16.540
mathematically you can
write the gauge field A mu

00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:21.925
as the so-called 1-form,
so-called 1-form, and then

00:19:21.925 --> 00:19:25.660
A mu, it just coefficients
of this 1-form.

00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:29.120
And then the field strings
is just so the derivative,

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:33.480
it's just exterior
derivative of this 1-form.

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:36.910
And then the
Lagrangian will be just

00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:40.730
minus one quarter
F mu mu, F mu mu

00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:44.590
construct from this procedure.

00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:46.380
So you can just
general-- mathematically

00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:48.210
straightforward to
generalize this you

00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:49.770
have dimension of forms.

00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:54.010
So for example, we
can consider n-form,

00:19:54.010 --> 00:20:00.730
which is the n-component
tensor, but all indices

00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:02.565
are fully anti-symmetric
with each other.

00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:15.194
So all the indices are fully
anti-symmetric with each other.

00:20:15.194 --> 00:20:16.610
So these are fully
anti-symmetric.

00:20:23.764 --> 00:20:25.180
If they depend on
the conventions,

00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:27.346
sometimes we also put the
one over n-factorial here.

00:20:31.659 --> 00:20:34.075
So you can define such objects,
such as the generalization

00:20:34.075 --> 00:20:38.960
of A, and the corresponding
field strings for this C,

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:46.080
we also called F. So
the field strings for C

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:51.330
is just a n plus 1-form, which
is exterior derivative of dC.

00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:56.530
And then this is n plus 1-form.

00:20:56.530 --> 00:21:00.310
Again, this is a fully
anti-symmetric tensor

00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:03.390
now with n plus 1 indices.

00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:07.590
And then you can write down
your Lagrangian similarly

00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:10.880
by generalizing these,
you can write s1

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:16.880
over-- let me write it here--
you can write the Lagrangian s

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:23.470
minus 1 over 1/2 times
n factorial-- 2 times

00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:29.520
n factorial, not 2n factorial--
2 times n factorial F mu1,

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:36.090
mu n plus 1, F mu1 mu n plus 1.

00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:42.370
So F is n plus 1-form, so it's
a tensor of n plus 1 indices,

00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:45.830
fully anti-symmetric
fully anti-symmetric.

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:56.550
So those fields essentially
have this kind of structure,

00:21:56.550 --> 00:21:58.620
essentially have this
kind of structure.

00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:03.120
And say the 1-form is very
similar to our Maxwell.

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:07.650
So this is a 3-form and
this is a scalar, then just

00:22:07.650 --> 00:22:10.550
a massless scalar,
then this is a 2-form

00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:12.790
whose field string
will be a 3-form,

00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:14.760
and then this is
a 4-form factor.

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:23.550
And then just by
definition, just like here,

00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:28.160
there's a gauge symmetry
because F equal to dA, here,

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:30.720
because this is F equal to dC.

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:38.500
So there's a gauge
symmetry because I

00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:45.470
can add C n, the total
derivative, of any n plus 1,

00:22:45.470 --> 00:22:48.270
n minus 1-form.

00:22:48.270 --> 00:22:51.560
So I can make a gauge
symmetry, so lambda n minus 1

00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:52.915
can be any n minus 1-form.

00:22:59.710 --> 00:23:07.040
And because of this square equal
to zero, now F is invariant.

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:08.476
So F n plus 1 is invariant.

00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:18.280
So if you put this into here,
and because this is already

00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:21.396
a total derivative,
and so F is invariant.

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:31.950
So there's a great
symmetry, then

00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:37.207
there will be a conserved charge
associated with those n-forms.

00:23:37.207 --> 00:23:39.790
You can define conserved charge
associated with those n-forms.

00:23:46.811 --> 00:23:47.810
So so far any questions?

00:23:50.641 --> 00:23:51.140
Yes.

00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:53.770
AUDIENCE: And maybe, so
there's a C field that they

00:23:53.770 --> 00:23:56.390
denoted fermions of bosons.

00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:58.500
HONG LIU: Bosons,
it's all bosons.

00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:04.670
AUDIENCE: But it looks--
so this anti-symmetric has

00:24:04.670 --> 00:24:06.490
nothing to do with fermions?

00:24:06.490 --> 00:24:10.080
HONG LIU: No, this
is just the indices.

00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:14.080
This just indices which
are anti-symmetric.

00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:17.730
This is not the location,
spacetime location.

00:24:17.730 --> 00:24:19.970
This is just indices.

00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:22.510
It's the same thing,
I think, F mu mu.

00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:24.580
F mu mu, the indices
are anti-symmetric.

00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:25.825
It's the same thing here.

00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:32.060
Are the people comfortable
with this differential form

00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:34.930
notation?

00:24:34.930 --> 00:24:36.174
Yes.

00:24:36.174 --> 00:24:37.098
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:24:40.959 --> 00:24:42.500
HONG LIU: Bosons,
they're all bosons.

00:24:47.704 --> 00:24:49.620
AUDIENCE: And where are
the partners of those?

00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:50.830
HONG LIU: Sorry?

00:24:50.830 --> 00:24:56.870
AUDIENCE: Hb and phi,
where are their partners?

00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:59.030
HONG LIU: So far I did
not write them down.

00:24:59.030 --> 00:25:00.420
So they are also fermionics.

00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:01.753
They are also massless fermions.

00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:10.970
We will not need to
worry about them.

00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:12.825
So they are massless
fermions in this.

00:25:12.825 --> 00:25:13.741
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:25:25.294 --> 00:25:25.960
HONG LIU: Right.

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:27.281
AUDIENCE: With superstrings.

00:25:27.281 --> 00:25:28.780
HONG LIU: Yeah those
just come from,

00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:31.130
because when you go
to the superstring,

00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:33.600
you have additional
fermions on the world-sheet.

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:36.720
And then they can give you
additional massless modes

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:39.400
essentially come from them.

00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:44.250
The story, the real story is
a little bit more complicated

00:25:44.250 --> 00:25:46.210
because actually
in the superstring,

00:25:46.210 --> 00:25:50.530
even those come from the
fermions, world-sheet fermions.

00:25:50.530 --> 00:25:54.070
Yeah but anyway vehicle
you have at the formula

00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:57.595
for the world-sheet, then you
have more possibilities then

00:25:57.595 --> 00:25:59.920
that give rise to those modes.

00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:01.990
That's the long story.

00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:05.830
AUDIENCE: Those modes are also
for bosons, not for fermions?

00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:12.030
HONG LIU: No, these are all of
the spacetime bosonic fields,

00:26:12.030 --> 00:26:15.000
which are low energy
excitations of the strings.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.690
And how they arise
on the world-sheet,

00:26:18.690 --> 00:26:21.140
whether they come from
fermions or from bosons

00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:25.680
on the world-sheet,
it's a separate issue.

00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:27.930
And, in fact, all
of them actually

00:26:27.930 --> 00:26:33.941
arise from world-sheet fermions,
but they are spacetime bosons.

00:26:33.941 --> 00:26:34.440
Yes.

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:40.205
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] of
these Ramond-Ramond fields?

00:26:40.205 --> 00:26:47.920
HONG LIU: Yeah, you just
workout their repetitions

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:50.585
under their say,
Lorentz symmetry.

00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:55.820
They're all integer
spin-- they're

00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:59.680
all integer spin-- they're
all integer spin repetitions

00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:01.600
of the Lorentz group.

00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:04.840
And not like fermions,
then will be half integer.

00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:14.160
They are generating repetitions
of the rotational group.

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:18.460
AUDIENCE: So they are
like spin 2, spin--

00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:22.060
HONG LIU: No, normally we don't
call them spin 2 or spin three.

00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:26.730
When we call spin 2, we mean
a fully symmetric indices,

00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:27.730
symmetric and traceless.

00:27:27.730 --> 00:27:30.063
AUDIENCE: But anti-symmetric,
we would never call them--

00:27:30.063 --> 00:27:32.600
HONG LIU: Yeah, we
don't call them spin.

00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:34.960
Just the repetitions
of the Lorentz group,

00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:38.000
it's-- it's just some
repetitions of it's integer.

00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:43.330
Good?

00:27:43.330 --> 00:27:52.280
And in the case of the Maxwell,
we know that for the 1-form,

00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:59.422
for the case of the Maxwell, its
source, where for A, its source

00:27:59.422 --> 00:28:00.255
is a point particle.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:14.270
So we can couple the--
so the point particle

00:28:14.270 --> 00:28:17.720
interact say with
this extender vector

00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:19.280
potential in the following way.

00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:27.530
So suppose a particle following
some trajectory described

00:28:27.530 --> 00:28:32.170
by x mu tau, and
then this particle,

00:28:32.170 --> 00:28:37.420
we are intact with this vector
potential in the following way.

00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:41.700
This is familiar from
E and M. So you just

00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:47.370
integrate essentially with
A along the trajectory

00:28:47.370 --> 00:28:48.770
of the particle.

00:28:48.770 --> 00:28:52.830
And you can write this in the
more compact mathematical form.

00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:56.800
You just say you integrate
along the trajectory

00:28:56.800 --> 00:29:00.680
and A is a 1-form, and you
just integrate this 1-form

00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:02.910
along the trajectory.

00:29:02.910 --> 00:29:17.154
And so this is so-called pull
back of this 1-form A to C.

00:29:17.154 --> 00:29:18.695
So this is the
mathematical language.

00:29:21.250 --> 00:29:26.150
Similarly, we can generalize to
these higher dimensional forms.

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:33.650
So 1-form, naturally coupled
to a point particle--

00:29:33.650 --> 00:29:38.250
which can be considered as
a zero-dimensional object.

00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:54.880
So a p plus 1-form, then
naturally-- I should say

00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:55.700
is fermion.

00:29:55.700 --> 00:30:08.360
Then a p-dimensional object
that naturally couples-- just

00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:17.090
as a generalization of
this-- to a p plus 1-form.

00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:29.150
As follows, you can
just-- the worldvolume

00:30:29.150 --> 00:30:33.880
of a p-dimensional object is a
surface of p plus 1 dimension.

00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:40.520
So the worldvolume of
p-dimensional objects--

00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:43.000
p plus 1 dimensions
because there's also time.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.810
You also move in the-- it's
a p-dimensional object moving

00:30:45.810 --> 00:30:48.550
the time, then in the
p plus one dimension.

00:30:48.550 --> 00:30:52.350
So let me call that
worldvolume sigma.

00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:55.090
And then the
naturalization of this

00:30:55.090 --> 00:31:02.690
will be this, the coupling
between a p-dimensional object

00:31:02.690 --> 00:31:05.240
to a p plus 1-form
will be like this.

00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:08.990
Just you integrate
this p plus 1-form

00:31:08.990 --> 00:31:12.920
on the worldvolume of
this p-dimensional object.

00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:25.400
And again, this is
the pull back of C

00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:32.790
to sigma, C plus 1 to sigma.

00:31:32.790 --> 00:31:37.410
And let me just write it
in a more explicit form.

00:31:37.410 --> 00:31:40.730
So here I use tau to
parametrize the trajectory

00:31:40.730 --> 00:31:42.010
along the [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:42.010 --> 00:31:45.440
So here, let me use
psi to parametrize

00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:49.600
the worldvolume
coordinate of this brane.

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:59.910
Then this pull back means mu
1, mu p plus 1, partial x mu

00:31:59.910 --> 00:32:08.980
1, partial psi 1, partial x mu
p plus 1, partial psi p plus 1.

00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:19.995
And x mu psi one,
psi zero to psi p

00:32:19.995 --> 00:32:21.870
describe the embedding
of sigma in spacetime.

00:32:33.570 --> 00:32:34.956
Any questions on this?

00:32:38.430 --> 00:32:43.140
So it tells you that-- so
this just tells you that the

00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:46.544
AUDIENCE: There is
[INAUDIBLE] p plus 1 back

00:32:46.544 --> 00:32:52.236
there could say zero because
of p because of notation.

00:32:52.236 --> 00:32:53.718
HONG LIU: Let me just do zero.

00:32:58.164 --> 00:33:01.660
AUDIENCE: Yes, so here
the p-dimensional object

00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:04.060
in the simple case is just
like the point particle

00:33:04.060 --> 00:33:05.340
is a zero-dimensional object.

00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:06.612
So that's what the object is.

00:33:06.612 --> 00:33:07.570
HONG LIU: That's right.

00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:14.390
The zero-dimensional object
naturally couple to 1-form

00:33:14.390 --> 00:33:15.250
in this way.

00:33:15.250 --> 00:33:17.760
And then a p-dimensional
object naturally couple to a p

00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:19.323
plus 1 dimensional this way.

00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:47.070
So let me just make,
in the Maxwell case,

00:33:47.070 --> 00:33:53.060
the gate symmetry here
implies an electric charge is

00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:57.290
conserved, OK, the electrical
charge is conserved.

00:33:57.290 --> 00:34:01.060
So for a p-dimensional
object coupled

00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:04.980
to a p plus 1 dimensional
form, and because

00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:09.755
of this gate symmetry and then
this charge is also conserved.

00:34:15.790 --> 00:34:18.780
In particular, the object
with minimal charge

00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:22.190
must be a stable object because
there's nothing to decay to.

00:34:27.070 --> 00:34:35.000
So again, after generalization
of this case, so

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.540
in the standard story, in the
standard electromagnetism,

00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:42.101
we can have an
electrically-charged particle,

00:34:42.101 --> 00:34:45.409
we can also have a
magnetically-charged particle.

00:34:45.409 --> 00:34:49.540
We can have a
magnetically-charged particle.

00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:57.270
In particular, you can talk
about the magnetic monopole

00:34:57.270 --> 00:34:59.497
in quantum mechanics
and et cetera,

00:34:59.497 --> 00:35:01.080
even though we have
not observed them.

00:35:04.570 --> 00:35:08.400
So similarly one can
generalize that concept

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:10.360
to higher dimensions.

00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:13.910
So let me first just
remind you of how

00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:17.710
we define the magmatic--
the mathematical way of how

00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:22.060
we define the
magnetically-charged object EM.

00:35:22.060 --> 00:35:29.030
So EM-- so because
F is a 2-form,

00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:34.500
we can dualize F-- so
this is Hodge dual.

00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:37.015
We can define
another form, which

00:35:37.015 --> 00:35:43.950
I call F tilde, which is related
to original F by Hodge dual.

00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:45.560
So this is a 2-form,
the Hodge dual

00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:49.650
of a 2-form in the four
dimension is another 2-form.

00:35:49.650 --> 00:35:55.850
And then I can write it
as the total derivative

00:35:55.850 --> 00:35:59.360
with another 1-form potential.

00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:05.590
And then the object-- so you
know that the under this dual,

00:36:05.590 --> 00:36:10.680
so F 0,1 is mapped
to F tilde 2, 3.

00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:13.520
So the electric field is
mapped to the magnetic field,

00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:16.410
and similarly, the
magnetic field here

00:36:16.410 --> 00:36:20.980
is mapped to the electric field
here, so under this Hodge dual,

00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:22.790
under this Hodge dual.

00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:25.290
I should not just write this.

00:36:25.290 --> 00:36:28.760
So after some minus sign
we'll not keep track of,

00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:31.370
and under this Hodge
dual, you essentially

00:36:31.370 --> 00:36:36.640
say the electric field
now I call magnetic field.

00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:48.780
So now object
coupled to a tilde,

00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:50.270
then it's magnetically charged.

00:37:03.140 --> 00:37:08.230
Because in terms of
A tilde, such objects

00:37:08.230 --> 00:37:11.870
they generate electric fields,
and from our original F point

00:37:11.870 --> 00:37:14.082
there is a magnetic fields.

00:37:14.082 --> 00:37:16.040
So there will be a
magnetically-charged object.

00:37:18.570 --> 00:37:21.325
So essentially that's how we
think about the magnetic moment

00:37:21.325 --> 00:37:24.560
pole, EM.

00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:29.462
So this can also be generalized
to this n-form case.

00:37:29.462 --> 00:37:36.200
So one can also
dualize an n-form.

00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:47.670
Is that we introduce use
a lot of C tilde, which

00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:50.390
is the dual of dC.

00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:56.330
So dC is the field strength
for C. So this is n-form.

00:37:56.330 --> 00:38:00.580
And the dC is the
field strength of C,

00:38:00.580 --> 00:38:09.070
and then I do a Hodge dual, and
then I define to be dC tilde.

00:38:09.070 --> 00:38:10.920
I define to be dC tilde.

00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:16.640
And the dC tilde--
so this is n-form.

00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:21.140
When you do a field strength
become n plus 1-form.

00:38:21.140 --> 00:38:30.652
And when you do the Hodge dual,
when you take the Hodg-- dual,

00:38:30.652 --> 00:38:35.330
the Hodge dual of
n-form is D minus n, OK?

00:38:35.330 --> 00:38:39.330
So this is D min n minus 2.

00:38:42.390 --> 00:38:46.440
So this should be a D
minus n minus 2-form

00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:48.850
because when you
take the D, then that

00:38:48.850 --> 00:38:52.160
makes into D minus
n minus 1-form,

00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:54.920
and this Hodge dual
take this n plus 1-form

00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:59.230
into D minus n minus 1 form.

00:38:59.230 --> 00:39:01.930
So you map your n-form to
a D minus n minus 2-form.

00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:07.230
So essentially,
it's the integration

00:39:07.230 --> 00:39:15.150
of the electric-magnetic
dual of E and M.

00:39:15.150 --> 00:39:34.230
So now you can couple a D minus
n minus 3-dimensional object

00:39:34.230 --> 00:39:35.265
to C tilde.

00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:50.430
And in terms of C, in
terms of regional C--

00:39:50.430 --> 00:39:52.560
so this is a
magnetic object, OK?

00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:07.070
Just the same as we
define magnetic object

00:40:07.070 --> 00:40:14.910
or magnetic monopole for
E and M. So is the clear?

00:40:14.910 --> 00:40:15.936
Yes.

00:40:15.936 --> 00:40:18.652
AUDIENCE: In order to
write F tilde and A tilde,

00:40:18.652 --> 00:40:22.700
do we have to assume that
there are no electric charges?

00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:24.780
HONG LIU: That's a good point.

00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:31.010
No, you don't have
to-- so you do this,

00:40:31.010 --> 00:40:33.040
you have to assume that
the equation of motion

00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:33.719
is satisfied.

00:40:33.719 --> 00:40:36.010
You have to assume the equation
of motion is satisfied,

00:40:36.010 --> 00:40:37.426
then you can write
this procedure.

00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:46.550
AUDIENCE: So if dF is equal
to J, then that is non-zero.

00:40:46.550 --> 00:40:48.047
So if there are--

00:40:48.047 --> 00:40:50.130
HONG LIU: So you have the
exact the same situation

00:40:50.130 --> 00:40:52.490
with E and M. It's just
identical situation

00:40:52.490 --> 00:40:55.170
with E and M. It's just
whatever you do in E and M

00:40:55.170 --> 00:40:57.122
you do it here.

00:40:57.122 --> 00:40:58.830
AUDIENCE: So I thought
that we could only

00:40:58.830 --> 00:41:02.138
write F equals to
dA because there

00:41:02.138 --> 00:41:04.940
were no magnetic monopole?

00:41:04.940 --> 00:41:07.470
HONG LIU: No, so
you can do that,

00:41:07.470 --> 00:41:10.950
now you have to introduce
some similarity,

00:41:10.950 --> 00:41:14.520
so that's why the magnetic
monopole have a Dirac string.

00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:16.729
That's why the magnetic
monopole have a Dirac string,

00:41:16.729 --> 00:41:18.728
then you have this Dirac
quantization condition,

00:41:18.728 --> 00:41:19.290
et cetera.

00:41:19.290 --> 00:41:22.870
So as you would then,
say either in E and M,

00:41:22.870 --> 00:41:26.800
or in the quantum mechanics,
say in the graduate quantum

00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:32.730
mechanics, or E and M.

00:41:32.730 --> 00:41:35.670
So are people familiar with the
concept of magnetic monopole

00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:38.440
and the Dirac-- so-called Dirac
string and Dirac quantization

00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:40.750
condition?

00:41:40.750 --> 00:41:44.140
Yeah, I saw some nodding heads.

00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:47.730
So you're not familiar
with it, then look at,

00:41:47.730 --> 00:41:52.380
for example, in one
chapter of Jackson

00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:57.240
have a very detailed discussion
of magnetic monopoles.

00:41:57.240 --> 00:41:59.890
But the best, actually,
was Dirac's original paper.

00:41:59.890 --> 00:42:03.300
It was really beautiful,
very, very beautiful.

00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:07.090
But Jackson has a rather
pedagogical discussion.

00:42:07.090 --> 00:42:10.210
Jackson's in actual
dynamics, that's a rather--

00:42:10.210 --> 00:42:12.584
AUDIENCE: Does he discuss the
differential forms, though,

00:42:12.584 --> 00:42:13.175
or no?

00:42:13.175 --> 00:42:14.300
HONG LIU: I don't remember.

00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:15.060
Oh, you mean Jackson?

00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:15.790
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:42:15.790 --> 00:42:16.915
HONG LIU: I don't remember.

00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:24.660
Yeah, it's the fact that you
can allow the magnetic monopole

00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:28.620
then if you allow the certain
singularities in the vector

00:42:28.620 --> 00:42:29.967
potential.

00:42:29.967 --> 00:42:31.550
And that's the
so-called Dirac string.

00:42:34.550 --> 00:42:36.170
So you don't have a thing to do.

00:42:36.170 --> 00:42:40.680
So the idea is that you--
what you were saying is right,

00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:42.400
the fact that you
could write F as dA

00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:44.540
means there's no
magmatic source,

00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:46.470
but you can introduce
a magnet source

00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:48.510
if you allow certain
singularities,

00:42:48.510 --> 00:42:52.235
and that's what Dirac realized.

00:42:55.810 --> 00:42:56.980
Good.

00:42:56.980 --> 00:43:03.630
So now, this other gauge
fields, in type IIA and type

00:43:03.630 --> 00:43:08.370
IIB string, and
they can give rise

00:43:08.370 --> 00:43:11.600
to extended objects
which couple to them.

00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:15.010
And it turns out
the extended object

00:43:15.010 --> 00:43:18.080
cover to those Ramond-Ramond
fields, are precisely D-branes.

00:43:22.580 --> 00:43:26.160
And they are precisely
D-branes, and because they

00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:31.090
couple to those gauge fields,
and they are stable objects.

00:43:31.090 --> 00:43:35.000
At least the minimally-charged
ones are stable objects.

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.440
So this is related to the
statement that actually

00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:40.660
in superstring you actually
find some stable branes.

00:43:40.660 --> 00:43:42.620
And the other
dimensions-- so let

00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:56.030
me just list them just to--
So with this preparation,

00:43:56.030 --> 00:44:05.380
then in IIA, so we can have the
following electric and fully

00:44:05.380 --> 00:44:08.480
magnetic object.

00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:11.442
See in the IIA we have a C mu1.

00:44:11.442 --> 00:44:12.150
We have a 1-form.

00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:20.490
So that means there's a
natural object coupled to it--

00:44:20.490 --> 00:44:21.990
electric object coupled to it.

00:44:21.990 --> 00:44:23.198
Turns out this is a D0-brane.

00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:30.130
A zero-dimension object coupled
to a 1-form, this is D0-brane.

00:44:30.130 --> 00:44:34.320
And as a 1-form
in 10 dimension--

00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:40.080
so in superstring we have
10 dimension-- is dual to--

00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:53.430
so D is 10 minus 1
is 9, minus 3 is 6,

00:44:53.430 --> 00:44:55.610
and a then the magnetic
object will be a D6-brane.

00:44:58.240 --> 00:45:04.300
So similarly we have a
3-form, and then this

00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:07.660
gave an electric D2-brane,
and a magmatic D4-brane.

00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:14.520
So if you just follow this rule.

00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:25.930
So for the type IIB, so let me
now first start with this C2.

00:45:25.930 --> 00:45:29.740
So this gives you a D-string
one-dimensional object

00:45:29.740 --> 00:45:32.740
coupled to it for the D-string.

00:45:32.740 --> 00:45:35.292
And then the
mathematical object will

00:45:35.292 --> 00:45:36.500
be a five-dimensional object.

00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:38.460
It's called a D5-brane.

00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:41.410
So this string is a D1-brane.

00:45:41.410 --> 00:45:44.010
So now, let's look
at this 4-form.

00:45:48.740 --> 00:45:52.270
So the so-called self-dual--
so sometimes we put a plus here

00:45:52.270 --> 00:45:54.100
to indicate this is a self-dual.

00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:57.860
So let me now explain
what this self-dual means.

00:45:57.860 --> 00:46:07.090
So self-dual means that from
C4, as we construct an F5--

00:46:07.090 --> 00:46:13.640
and construct an
F5 from this C4--

00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:16.920
to be a self-dual form means
that this forms satisfies

00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:21.970
the condition that
F5 equal to F5 dual.

00:46:21.970 --> 00:46:24.260
So this is a self-dual.

00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:28.379
Just means this is a constraint
that this C has to satisfy.

00:46:28.379 --> 00:46:29.920
So this is called
a self-dual 4-form.

00:46:36.950 --> 00:46:39.230
If you look at repetitions
of the Lorentz symmetry,

00:46:39.230 --> 00:46:42.330
you'll find that this is
actually a repetition.

00:46:42.330 --> 00:46:46.780
And so for this C,
you have to satisfy

00:46:46.780 --> 00:46:49.590
this self-duality condition.

00:46:49.590 --> 00:46:54.010
Then now, for object
which coupled to the C,

00:46:54.010 --> 00:46:57.450
would be a naturally
D3-brane because

00:46:57.450 --> 00:47:01.130
the three-dimensional
object coupled to a 4-form,

00:47:01.130 --> 00:47:03.900
so it would be a D3-brane.

00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:09.330
And this D3-brane, because of
this self-duality condition,

00:47:09.330 --> 00:47:17.410
we have to be both electrically
and magnetically-charged

00:47:17.410 --> 00:47:18.990
because this is
a self-dual form.

00:47:26.540 --> 00:47:29.060
So this must source
both electric flux

00:47:29.060 --> 00:47:32.600
and the magnetic flux to be
consistent with self-duality.

00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:42.730
And then finally,
you can also have

00:47:42.730 --> 00:47:47.080
a scalar field in the type IIB.

00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:49.330
And the scalar field,
now eventually you

00:47:49.330 --> 00:47:53.620
will couple to so-called the
D minus 1 dimensional brane.

00:47:53.620 --> 00:47:56.550
Because scalar field, by
itself, is zero dimension.

00:47:56.550 --> 00:47:59.610
It's already zero
dimensional form.

00:47:59.610 --> 00:48:01.110
So following this
convention we will

00:48:01.110 --> 00:48:04.350
couple to a D minus
1 dimensional brane.

00:48:04.350 --> 00:48:08.410
And that obviously
not make much sense,

00:48:08.410 --> 00:48:11.750
but actually can make sense when
you go to Euclidean signature,

00:48:11.750 --> 00:48:15.920
and then it turns out
this scalar fields

00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:18.210
couple to something
called the instanton,

00:48:18.210 --> 00:48:19.700
which I will not go into there.

00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:20.908
Something called D-instanton.

00:48:23.580 --> 00:48:28.710
So the bottom line
is that the object,

00:48:28.710 --> 00:48:30.880
they are charged under
[INAUDIBLE] fields,

00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:32.325
they are all D-branes.

00:48:32.325 --> 00:48:38.480
They are all D-branes, and they
come into those dimensions.

00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:41.090
And any D-brane-- of
course you can define

00:48:41.090 --> 00:48:43.220
D-branes with other dimensions.

00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:47.290
So you can consider
in IIA a D3-brane.

00:48:47.290 --> 00:48:50.510
But in IIA, a D3-brane
will not be a stable object

00:48:50.510 --> 00:48:53.520
because there's not conserved
charge for you to couple to.

00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:57.080
So even though in IIA you
can consider a D3-brane,

00:48:57.080 --> 00:49:00.120
but it's not a stable
object, and actually,

00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:04.286
when you quantized the spectrum
on the D3-brane in IIA, then

00:49:04.286 --> 00:49:05.410
you find there's a tachyon.

00:49:05.410 --> 00:49:08.040
Again there's a tachyon in
the worldvolume that indicates

00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:10.320
that's not a stable object.

00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:14.280
But those branes
don't have a tachyon.

00:49:16.950 --> 00:49:18.500
And in particular,
on those branes,

00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:23.100
these are all
supersymmetric field series.

00:49:23.100 --> 00:49:25.680
For example, the
most important one

00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:28.350
is this D3-brane
because then you

00:49:28.350 --> 00:49:30.217
have four dimensions
of worldvolume,

00:49:30.217 --> 00:49:32.050
then you actually have
four-dimension theory

00:49:32.050 --> 00:49:36.160
on this D3-brane,
and that's what

00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:39.565
gives you so-called
super-Yang-Mills theory.

00:49:39.565 --> 00:49:45.980
So on these branes, on
these stable branes,

00:49:45.980 --> 00:49:56.490
all of the theories--
super-Yang-Mills theory,

00:49:56.490 --> 00:50:01.270
in particular for D3, it's
given by a so-called n

00:50:01.270 --> 00:50:06.230
equal to four super-Yang-Mills
theory in four dimensions.

00:50:14.310 --> 00:50:17.144
AUDIENCE: So what you're saying
is for any sign table, does

00:50:17.144 --> 00:50:19.004
it mean dissolving--

00:50:19.004 --> 00:50:21.090
HONG LIU: Yeah, it can decay.

00:50:21.090 --> 00:50:21.800
It can decay.

00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:23.591
AUDIENCE: But you lower
dimension of brane?

00:50:26.286 --> 00:50:27.910
HONG LIU: It's possible
for it to decay

00:50:27.910 --> 00:50:30.140
into lower dimensional
brane, and it can also

00:50:30.140 --> 00:50:32.850
for it just to decay
into closed string modes,

00:50:32.850 --> 00:50:36.296
radiated closed string modes.

00:50:36.296 --> 00:50:38.848
AUDIENCE: But, I mean the
dimensions of these two objects

00:50:38.848 --> 00:50:40.060
are different.

00:50:40.060 --> 00:50:42.850
It sounds like if branes
decay to a string,

00:50:42.850 --> 00:50:44.250
it will become infinite string.

00:50:44.250 --> 00:50:46.625
HONG LIU: Yeah, that's right,
ud type density of strings.

00:50:53.630 --> 00:50:55.770
It's actually a
beautiful subject

00:50:55.770 --> 00:50:57.870
to discuss those
branes, how they decay.

00:51:04.060 --> 00:51:08.550
Yeah, it's a nice subject, but
it's way out of our discussion

00:51:08.550 --> 00:51:09.050
here.

00:51:12.570 --> 00:51:13.750
Any questions?

00:51:13.750 --> 00:51:14.380
Yes.

00:51:14.380 --> 00:51:17.820
AUDIENCE: As to four, if we
consider stacks of such branes,

00:51:17.820 --> 00:51:19.572
do we get higher-ranked
age groups?

00:51:19.572 --> 00:51:20.780
HONG LIU: Yeah, that's right.

00:51:20.780 --> 00:51:21.460
Exactly.

00:51:21.460 --> 00:51:23.070
It always give you n.

00:51:27.570 --> 00:51:37.220
Good, so that concludes our
discussion of the D-branes

00:51:37.220 --> 00:51:40.750
from the point of view as
the rich boundary conditions.

00:51:48.220 --> 00:51:52.284
So now, I want to take a
slightly different perspective

00:51:52.284 --> 00:51:52.950
on the D-branes.

00:51:56.060 --> 00:52:02.030
From this perspective,
from the perspective

00:52:02.030 --> 00:52:06.180
the object, which are
charged under those

00:52:06.180 --> 00:52:09.510
generalized gauge fields.

00:52:09.510 --> 00:52:12.000
And now I want to
view those D-branes.

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:14.420
I have some objects,
some solitons,

00:52:14.420 --> 00:52:16.290
if you want some
solitons, which are

00:52:16.290 --> 00:52:18.940
charged under those
generalized gauge fields.

00:52:21.740 --> 00:52:23.365
I want elaborate from
this perspective.

00:52:41.600 --> 00:52:45.620
I talk about the
different perspective.

00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:20.250
So D-brane has
math, has tension.

00:53:20.250 --> 00:53:22.510
Also D-brane carry--
so now we only

00:53:22.510 --> 00:53:24.440
consider those stable D-branes.

00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:26.830
So they have a mass, they
also carry those charges,

00:53:26.830 --> 00:53:28.320
conserved charges.

00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:30.610
So that means there will
be flux coming out--

00:53:30.610 --> 00:53:33.380
electrical or magnetic flux
coming out of those branes.

00:53:36.440 --> 00:53:41.470
So that will deform
the spacetime

00:53:41.470 --> 00:53:43.940
because the gravity
will deform spacetime.

00:53:48.220 --> 00:53:49.670
And so now, we'd
like to find out

00:53:49.670 --> 00:53:52.860
what are the spacetime
around those D-branes.

00:53:52.860 --> 00:53:55.640
How do they deform spacetime?

00:53:55.640 --> 00:54:00.060
So for example, say
it consider charge

00:54:00.060 --> 00:54:02.190
as a total example of this.

00:54:02.190 --> 00:54:05.520
Say, let's consider just
again in the Maxwell theory,

00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:08.540
in Einstein-Maxwell theory,
consider, for example,

00:54:08.540 --> 00:54:25.130
a charged particle
sitting at the origin

00:54:25.130 --> 00:54:33.395
of a four-dimensional
spacetime, Minkowski spacetime,

00:54:33.395 --> 00:54:34.280
for example.

00:54:39.180 --> 00:54:43.110
So if you include
both GR and E and M,

00:54:43.110 --> 00:54:45.080
then the dynamics of
this series controlled

00:54:45.080 --> 00:54:47.650
by so-called
Einstein-Maxwell-- so you

00:54:47.650 --> 00:54:54.900
will have a Einstein
theory and the Maxwell.

00:54:58.470 --> 00:55:00.560
So the dynamics
of such particles

00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:02.000
should be captured by them.

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:05.101
And so this captures the
gravity due to the particle.

00:55:05.101 --> 00:55:06.850
This captures E and M
due to the particle.

00:55:11.960 --> 00:55:17.560
So from here, you can work out
how does this particle deform

00:55:17.560 --> 00:55:22.170
spacetime from the
Einstein equation?

00:55:22.170 --> 00:55:24.810
So the equation
motion of this system

00:55:24.810 --> 00:55:31.950
would be, you have
a standard Maxwell--

00:55:31.950 --> 00:55:37.490
so I will be careful about
the minus sign-- and also

00:55:37.490 --> 00:55:46.587
the Einstein equation,
the stress tensor.

00:55:53.330 --> 00:56:03.680
So j is just the-- if I have a
charged particle sitting there,

00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:06.010
there's no current, there's
only a charged density.

00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:15.920
And the stress tensor
contains two parts.

00:56:15.920 --> 00:56:20.610
It's the stress tensor
due to the particle

00:56:20.610 --> 00:56:25.000
and also the stress due to
the electromagnetic fields.

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:29.490
Because this excited the
electrogmagnetic fields.

00:56:29.490 --> 00:56:36.670
And the particle part only
have a zero component,

00:56:36.670 --> 00:56:38.580
so you only have a mass.

00:56:38.580 --> 00:56:40.310
There's no momentum.

00:56:40.310 --> 00:56:46.850
So this is just a--
maybe I should write r.

00:56:46.850 --> 00:56:48.790
I think I'm using
the notation of r.

00:56:51.580 --> 00:56:55.550
So the particle part
of the stress tensor

00:56:55.550 --> 00:56:57.850
would be just the data function.

00:56:57.850 --> 00:57:02.000
The only non-zero component
are zero-zero component.

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:04.450
You only have energy
density and just given

00:57:04.450 --> 00:57:07.070
by the data function
of the mass.

00:57:09.660 --> 00:57:13.610
So from here, by
solving those equations

00:57:13.610 --> 00:57:17.170
we see those forces
then you can work out

00:57:17.170 --> 00:57:19.800
how a charged particle
deforms your spacetime.

00:57:47.980 --> 00:57:51.879
So let me just say
I'm a bit further,

00:57:51.879 --> 00:57:54.170
for example you can easily
solve the Einstein equation,

00:57:54.170 --> 00:57:57.010
we all know the
solutions, so you just

00:57:57.010 --> 00:58:06.800
have a coulomb potential,
and in other words

00:58:06.800 --> 00:58:10.670
you have electric
flux surrounding

00:58:10.670 --> 00:58:16.050
the s2 around the point
particle, you go to q.

00:58:19.630 --> 00:58:24.470
Again, this is the dual of F.
You have electric field, when

00:58:24.470 --> 00:58:27.820
you dualize that hyperspatial
component, then that gives you

00:58:27.820 --> 00:58:30.830
the-- so this a Gauss node, OK?

00:58:30.830 --> 00:58:32.060
This is a Gauss node.

00:58:38.300 --> 00:58:43.730
And you can also work out
the metric surrounding

00:58:43.730 --> 00:58:45.780
this charged particles.

00:58:45.780 --> 00:58:50.446
So because of the spacetime
symmetric, spherical symmetric,

00:58:50.446 --> 00:58:53.070
then you can actually write down
the spherical symmetric ansatz

00:58:53.070 --> 00:58:54.610
for the metric
around the particle.

00:59:10.570 --> 00:59:19.415
So from the Einstein equation,
you can find out what's-- you

00:59:19.415 --> 00:59:22.610
can work out what
is f(r) and h(r).

00:59:25.230 --> 00:59:29.860
Some of you may have already
done this exercise before.

00:59:29.860 --> 00:59:34.920
So if your q is zero,
what answer would you get?

00:59:34.920 --> 00:59:35.960
That's right.

00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:41.930
So if the q is
zero, then you just

00:59:41.930 --> 00:59:43.840
get the Schwarzschild metric.

00:59:43.840 --> 00:59:46.550
And it's the exactly
the metric say produced

00:59:46.550 --> 00:59:48.170
by a song, et cetera, far away.

00:59:51.630 --> 00:59:53.520
So here we have a
charge, then what

00:59:53.520 --> 00:59:57.120
you get is something called
the Reissner-Nordstrom metric.

00:59:57.120 --> 01:00:02.770
And when you have a charge
having electromagnetic fields.

01:00:02.770 --> 01:00:15.540
So you will get so-called
Reissner-Nordstrom metric.

01:00:19.412 --> 01:00:21.370
AUDIENCE: So that's
if q equals 0?

01:00:21.370 --> 01:00:22.356
If q equals 0?

01:00:22.356 --> 01:00:26.460
HONG LIU: No, q larger equal to
zero is the Reissner-Nordstrom.

01:00:26.460 --> 01:00:28.300
And when q equal to
zero, then you just

01:00:28.300 --> 01:00:36.772
get the Schwarzschild That's how
you calculate the precession.

01:00:36.772 --> 01:00:39.105
That's what you use to calculate
the precession of, say,

01:00:39.105 --> 01:00:39.730
of the mercury.

01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:45.510
Similarly, you can
also do this for

01:00:45.510 --> 01:00:47.730
magnetically-charged particle.

01:00:47.730 --> 01:01:00.170
So the only difference for
magnetically-charged particle,

01:01:00.170 --> 01:01:03.150
the difference is
that this equation now

01:01:03.150 --> 01:01:08.150
becomes just directly
magnetic flux

01:01:08.150 --> 01:01:21.145
equal to G. Say for example,
if the magnetic charge is G,

01:01:21.145 --> 01:01:24.130
and then you will get this.

01:01:24.130 --> 01:01:27.150
Then instead you have
this, and then you

01:01:27.150 --> 01:01:32.490
have yeah-- We have
a magnetic flux.

01:01:32.490 --> 01:01:35.545
And again, you could
plug into any equation

01:01:35.545 --> 01:01:40.030
you solve, you get the same
Reissner-Nordstrom metric.

01:01:40.030 --> 01:01:50.790
It's also a Dirac
quantization telling you

01:01:50.790 --> 01:01:59.680
that the qg should be quantized
in integers of 2 pi n-- so n

01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:01.560
equal one, two, et cetera.

01:02:10.410 --> 01:02:12.720
So this is the familiar
story in the GR,

01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:19.040
so if you want to look at how
the gravity and the E and M

01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:23.210
surrounding the charged objects,
and so you can generalize

01:02:23.210 --> 01:02:27.480
this story immediately
to those branes, which

01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:29.930
are charged-- which
have their own mass

01:02:29.930 --> 01:02:34.560
and charged under some
generalized gauge fields.

01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:37.940
So you can generalize
that immediately.

01:02:37.940 --> 01:02:39.874
So you can generalize
procedure immediately

01:02:39.874 --> 01:02:41.040
to higher-dimension objects.

01:02:46.780 --> 01:02:53.260
So you can just, as a
single exercise in GR,

01:02:53.260 --> 01:02:56.690
you can just carry
out this procedure,

01:02:56.690 --> 01:03:01.540
just replace this to some
higher-dimensional form,

01:03:01.540 --> 01:03:03.970
under the source is some
higher-dimensional object,

01:03:03.970 --> 01:03:05.469
then you can work
out the solutions.

01:03:10.070 --> 01:03:14.890
And that was a simple exercise
which actually Horowitz

01:03:14.890 --> 01:03:17.310
and Strominger-Dietz,
in the early '90s,

01:03:17.310 --> 01:03:21.600
in 1991, it's a trivial
generalization you can do,

01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:22.895
why not do it?

01:03:22.895 --> 01:03:27.640
But turns out that's a
very, very important step

01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:34.310
to do for the reason
which I will explain.

01:03:34.310 --> 01:03:37.010
So for simplicity, let
me just talk a little bit

01:03:37.010 --> 01:03:39.980
about doing this
for this D3-brane,

01:03:39.980 --> 01:03:42.620
also for definite entities, you
could do it for any of this.

01:03:42.620 --> 01:03:47.752
And let me just say
it for D3-brane.

01:03:47.752 --> 01:03:56.450
So now consider the D3-brane--
so D3-brane is part of the type

01:03:56.450 --> 01:04:03.350
IIB theory, so of course,
we don't know to really do

01:04:03.350 --> 01:04:04.910
this in the full
type IIB string,

01:04:04.910 --> 01:04:08.280
so we will do the low energy
limit of the type IIB sting.

01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:11.010
So we will do this
for the D3-brane.

01:04:11.010 --> 01:04:14.422
In the low energy limit
of type IIB stream,

01:04:14.422 --> 01:04:16.130
which is so-called
type IIB supergravity.

01:04:19.937 --> 01:04:22.020
So it doesn't matter that
you don't learn anything

01:04:22.020 --> 01:04:22.670
about type IIB.

01:04:22.670 --> 01:04:25.310
Supergravity, and
essentially, that's

01:04:25.310 --> 01:04:28.020
just some generalization
of this equation.

01:04:28.020 --> 01:04:29.980
Type IIB supergravity
is some generalization

01:04:29.980 --> 01:04:33.090
of this equation.

01:04:33.090 --> 01:04:35.550
But nevertheless let me just
introduce some notations just

01:04:35.550 --> 01:04:47.590
to be-- So type
IIB supergravity--

01:04:47.590 --> 01:04:52.180
we will do this in the law
of limit of the IIB string.

01:04:52.180 --> 01:05:03.235
So this is the law
energy effective theory

01:05:03.235 --> 01:05:11.960
for massless modes
of IIB string.

01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:24.880
So it has the form as
what we had before.

01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:28.230
You have 1 over 6 pi, T pi GN.

01:05:28.230 --> 01:05:30.980
But not this is a
10-dimensional Newton constant,

01:05:30.980 --> 01:05:36.050
so this is a 10-dimensional
theory equal to 10.

01:05:36.050 --> 01:05:40.300
And you have the Einstein
term, and then you

01:05:40.300 --> 01:05:45.610
have forms associated with all
of this flux, generalized gauge

01:05:45.610 --> 01:05:47.665
fields, et cetera,
fermions, et cetera.

01:05:50.470 --> 01:05:55.600
And as we said before, the
relation with string theory,

01:05:55.600 --> 01:06:02.700
the Newton constant should be
proportional to gs squared.

01:06:02.700 --> 01:06:06.690
So you can actually work
out the prefactor precisely.

01:06:06.690 --> 01:06:08.900
So let me just write
down the prefactor.

01:06:08.900 --> 01:06:11.720
So the relation with
the string is-- just

01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:14.480
on the dimensional ground,
so this is the Newton

01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:16.680
constant in 10
dimensions, so this

01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:21.930
would have dimension
eight in terms of the lens

01:06:21.930 --> 01:06:23.002
have dimension eight.

01:06:23.002 --> 01:06:25.460
So the right-hand side I must
be upper prime to the power 4

01:06:25.460 --> 01:06:28.989
because this is only lens
scale in string theory.

01:06:28.989 --> 01:06:30.530
And then the prefactor,
it turned out

01:06:30.530 --> 01:06:35.680
to be-- so you can
work out the prefactor,

01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:40.980
so turns out 16 pi GN is
equal to 2 pi to the power 7.

01:06:46.709 --> 01:06:49.000
Say, when you work out the
law energy effective theory,

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:53.020
you can work out
this precise factor.

01:06:53.020 --> 01:06:55.370
And the regime of the
validity of this type IIB

01:06:55.370 --> 01:07:08.065
supergravity is that the gs
is much, much smaller than 1.

01:07:08.065 --> 01:07:11.620
The string [INAUDIBLE] should
be much, much smaller than 1.

01:07:11.620 --> 01:07:14.589
So that just tells-- this is
a statement the string loop

01:07:14.589 --> 01:07:16.380
correction should be
small because the when

01:07:16.380 --> 01:07:19.640
the string become big,
the loop correction

01:07:19.640 --> 01:07:21.165
become more and more important.

01:07:26.170 --> 01:07:27.920
The loop correction
would be more and more

01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:33.110
important from the
point of view of gravity

01:07:33.110 --> 01:07:35.800
this quantum
gravitational corrections.

01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:38.460
And so when G string become
big, the quantum gravitational

01:07:38.460 --> 01:07:41.586
corrections-- so spacetime
will fluctuate more.

01:07:41.586 --> 01:07:44.700
And then of course you cannot
trust the classical gravity

01:07:44.700 --> 01:07:45.790
in that region.

01:07:45.790 --> 01:07:47.930
So if you want to trust
the classical gravity,

01:07:47.930 --> 01:07:51.120
you want to have small
coupling, or translate

01:07:51.120 --> 01:07:55.620
into this language, the Newton
constant has to be small.

01:07:55.620 --> 01:07:56.120
OK?

01:07:56.120 --> 01:07:57.620
The Newton constant
has to be small.

01:07:57.620 --> 01:07:58.990
That means the gravity's weak.

01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:06.240
But in real life,
gravity's weak, so it's OK.

01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:13.586
And so this means the
quantum correction is small,

01:08:13.586 --> 01:08:15.210
so you can trust the
classical gravity.

01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:21.870
So you can trust
classical gravity.

01:08:21.870 --> 01:08:26.450
And then we also want
the energy-- no energy,

01:08:26.450 --> 01:08:28.290
so we want energy
squared to be smaller

01:08:28.290 --> 01:08:31.580
then one over alpha prime.

01:08:31.580 --> 01:08:34.189
Because when energy squared
becomes more than one

01:08:34.189 --> 01:08:36.446
over alpha prime, then
the massless string modes

01:08:36.446 --> 01:08:38.279
become important because
all of the massless

01:08:38.279 --> 01:08:41.729
string modes have mass square
of one over alpha prime.

01:08:41.729 --> 01:08:43.430
And if we only
want to concentrate

01:08:43.430 --> 01:08:46.250
on the massless modes, and then
you don't want to excite them.

01:08:50.140 --> 01:08:53.319
And also you want the curvature
of the spacetime-- here

01:08:53.319 --> 01:08:56.390
we're considering
curve spacetime--

01:08:56.390 --> 01:08:58.689
so you want the curvature
to be much smaller than one

01:08:58.689 --> 01:08:59.740
over alpha prime.

01:09:04.813 --> 01:09:06.229
So this gravity,
essentially, when

01:09:06.229 --> 01:09:07.854
you consider the mass
of this particle,

01:09:07.854 --> 01:09:11.270
you consider the particle
limit of the spacetime.

01:09:11.270 --> 01:09:13.590
So this can be
considered-- as you

01:09:13.590 --> 01:09:16.300
can see, the
spacetime curvature--

01:09:16.300 --> 01:09:19.479
the spacetime curvature radius
is much much-- so alpha prime

01:09:19.479 --> 01:09:25.363
is essentially it gives us the
rough lens scale of a string.

01:09:25.363 --> 01:09:27.779
And then when the curvature
is much, much smaller than one

01:09:27.779 --> 01:09:30.154
over alpha prime, that means
that the sight of the string

01:09:30.154 --> 01:09:34.979
is tiny compared to
the curvature radius,

01:09:34.979 --> 01:09:37.210
the typical size of your system.

01:09:37.210 --> 01:09:41.090
And that you can roughly
treat them as point particles,

01:09:41.090 --> 01:09:43.840
and that's what the
gravity theory does.

01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:46.060
In the supergravity theory
it's all point particles.

01:09:49.819 --> 01:09:54.735
And so this means we
decouple massless modes.

01:10:04.180 --> 01:10:05.884
So you can count
on massless modes.

01:10:09.970 --> 01:10:13.010
So whenever you take
a limit, you always

01:10:13.010 --> 01:10:14.881
have to take the
dimensionless number small.

01:10:14.881 --> 01:10:16.380
So the dimensionless
number is alpha

01:10:16.380 --> 01:10:20.360
prime times curvature, of
alpha times energy squared.

01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:23.820
But in reality, we often--
when we work with a theory,

01:10:23.820 --> 01:10:25.950
we often just keep
our curvature,

01:10:25.950 --> 01:10:29.299
or our energy scale
as what we want.

01:10:29.299 --> 01:10:30.840
And then in talking
about this limit,

01:10:30.840 --> 01:10:34.970
we just say, we take alpha
prime goes to zero limit.

01:10:34.970 --> 01:10:37.061
We say we take alpha
prime goes to zero limit.

01:10:37.061 --> 01:10:38.560
So that means a law
of energy limit.

01:10:41.130 --> 01:10:44.170
Even though, legitimately,
this is not the right thing

01:10:44.170 --> 01:10:47.880
to say because this is the
dimensional prime integral.

01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:53.210
And so the regime where
supergravity works,

01:10:53.210 --> 01:10:56.760
can be formulated, say, as
alpha prime goes to zero

01:10:56.760 --> 01:10:57.940
and the g string goes to 0.

01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:06.470
So in this regime, now you
can work with supergravity,

01:11:06.470 --> 01:11:14.105
and now you can now generalize
this story to the branes.

01:11:14.105 --> 01:11:16.137
Now generalize this
story for branes.

01:11:16.137 --> 01:11:18.720
So now let me say a few things
about the D-branes-- D3-branes.

01:11:44.070 --> 01:11:53.100
So they D-brane, D3-brane's
charged under C 4

01:11:53.100 --> 01:11:59.014
plus-- process and
we said this C 4 plus

01:11:59.014 --> 01:12:00.180
is required to be self-dual.

01:12:02.740 --> 01:12:06.050
That means any
source of C 4 plus

01:12:06.050 --> 01:12:08.630
must carry both electric
and magnetic charge.

01:12:08.630 --> 01:12:15.520
So that means that
for the D3-brane-- say

01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:23.060
if we define an electric
charge to be-- So now,

01:12:23.060 --> 01:12:27.860
so the D3-brane is a
three-dimensional object

01:12:27.860 --> 01:12:31.060
and the transverse direction is
a six-dimensional because this

01:12:31.060 --> 01:12:34.240
is 3 plus 1 including time,
so the transverse direction

01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:36.080
is six-dimensional.

01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:39.790
So we can similarly just
think about the D3-brane.

01:12:39.790 --> 01:12:45.790
So if we ignore the spatial
direction along the brane, then

01:12:45.790 --> 01:12:48.300
the D3-brane, the
transverse direction

01:12:48.300 --> 01:12:52.560
then can be just considered
a point in R6, OK?

01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:55.170
So a way to think about the
D3-brane, the surrounding

01:12:55.170 --> 01:12:59.420
of the D3-brane, it's an
analog of a point in R6,

01:12:59.420 --> 01:13:01.360
in the six-dimensional space.

01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:03.700
Is this clear?

01:13:03.700 --> 01:13:05.790
This is going to
be very important.

01:13:05.790 --> 01:13:12.400
And then the surrounding this
point, the sphere will S5.

01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:16.460
Just like in the electric case,
just like the E and M case,

01:13:16.460 --> 01:13:19.220
this is the S2 surround
the point particle,

01:13:19.220 --> 01:13:21.220
and this S5 is the
sphere, which is

01:13:21.220 --> 01:13:23.720
surrounding the whole D3-brane.

01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:26.620
And then this D3 can have
electric and magnetic flux

01:13:26.620 --> 01:13:29.580
through this S5.

01:13:29.580 --> 01:13:38.300
And so electric charge would
be just the 5-form running

01:13:38.300 --> 01:13:38.910
through it.

01:13:41.430 --> 01:13:52.500
And the magnetic charge
would be just-- right.

01:13:52.500 --> 01:13:55.610
Minus the dual of
5-form is 1-form--

01:13:55.610 --> 01:13:58.270
just make the relation
between these two.

01:14:01.090 --> 01:14:06.070
And now because of
self-duality condition,

01:14:06.070 --> 01:14:07.980
then they must be the same.

01:14:07.980 --> 01:14:10.430
So that means for the D3-brane,
the electric and magnetic

01:14:10.430 --> 01:14:11.430
charge must be the same.

01:14:14.980 --> 01:14:17.870
And also for
higher-dimensional object--

01:14:17.870 --> 01:14:20.510
AUDIENCE: Excuse me, why
should they be the same?

01:14:20.510 --> 01:14:21.090
Why not--

01:14:21.090 --> 01:14:24.930
HONG LIU: It's because
of F5, you get F5 star.

01:14:24.930 --> 01:14:26.424
It's because of that.

01:14:26.424 --> 01:14:28.663
Because of that
self-dual condition.

01:14:31.402 --> 01:14:33.360
So electric and magnetic
charge of the D3-brane

01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:34.068
must be the same.

01:14:34.068 --> 01:14:38.120
It must carry both electric
and magnetic charge.

01:14:38.120 --> 01:14:42.840
And now, this Dirac
quantization condition

01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:49.240
also works for
higher-dimensional objects.

01:14:49.240 --> 01:14:52.230
And again, it's a
very simple exercise

01:14:52.230 --> 01:14:57.290
to do it-- very simple
exercise to generalize Dirac's

01:14:57.290 --> 01:14:59.770
argument to higher dimension.

01:14:59.770 --> 01:15:01.380
Again, it's just
related to how you

01:15:01.380 --> 01:15:04.660
treat those higher-dimensional
forms, et cetera.

01:15:04.660 --> 01:15:08.780
Again, it's a very simple step,
but it's a very important step.

01:15:08.780 --> 01:15:14.470
So that tells mu that's for
D3-brane, which is self-dual,

01:15:14.470 --> 01:15:18.170
which carry both electric
and magnetic charge,

01:15:18.170 --> 01:15:21.950
then you have to satisfy
this quantization condition.

01:15:21.950 --> 01:15:25.960
Then that means the
minimal single D3-brane,

01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:31.634
the minimally-charged
object, the charge

01:15:31.634 --> 01:15:32.800
must be square root of 2 pi.

01:15:36.680 --> 01:15:45.586
And for n of them, it must D3
equal to q3 equal to 2 pi n.

01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:01.850
So now we have to
specify the analog

01:16:01.850 --> 01:16:03.640
for E and M, those conditions.

01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:10.150
Now we also have to specify
the mass of the D3-brane.

01:16:10.150 --> 01:16:12.040
So as we discussed
before, tension

01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:19.730
over the D3-brane,
tension over D-brane

01:16:19.730 --> 01:16:24.260
should be proportional
to one over gs.

01:16:24.260 --> 01:16:27.070
That you also did
in your P-sets.

01:16:27.070 --> 01:16:30.780
And again, by doing a
precise calculation,

01:16:30.780 --> 01:16:33.210
you can work out the
precise prefactors.

01:16:33.210 --> 01:16:38.500
It turns out actually to
be the following form.

01:16:38.500 --> 01:16:43.791
It's the q3 divided by 16 pi GN.

01:16:47.850 --> 01:16:52.220
And the GN is just gs
squared, so if you translate

01:16:52.220 --> 01:16:58.170
into-- so for n D3-brane,
that would be n divided

01:16:58.170 --> 01:17:04.690
by 2 pi cubed gs
alpha prime squared.

01:17:04.690 --> 01:17:06.780
So this gs and
alpha prime squared

01:17:06.780 --> 01:17:08.140
we know on general grounds.

01:17:08.140 --> 01:17:11.150
So gs we'd-- one over gs
we know on general ground,

01:17:11.150 --> 01:17:14.170
and alpha prime squared just
from dimensional analysis.

01:17:14.170 --> 01:17:17.010
Because this is a
three-dimensional object,

01:17:17.010 --> 01:17:18.790
the tension we'll
have mass dimension

01:17:18.790 --> 01:17:22.360
4, so that's why you have one
over alpha prime squared here.

01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:26.450
And then the other 2 pi cubed
from precise calculations.

01:17:26.450 --> 01:17:28.360
And you can also
write it in this form

01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:29.636
in terms of Newton constants.

01:17:32.140 --> 01:17:34.120
And the reason I write
this form because this

01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:36.594
is a very special case.

01:17:36.594 --> 01:17:39.010
And you see that the tension
is actually precisely related

01:17:39.010 --> 01:17:41.780
to the charge and divided by
the square root of Newton's

01:17:41.780 --> 01:17:42.890
constant.

01:17:42.890 --> 01:17:47.060
And it turns out that
only special objects

01:17:47.060 --> 01:17:48.820
have this kind of property.

01:17:48.820 --> 01:17:51.022
And this is so-called
BPS objects.

01:17:51.022 --> 01:17:51.980
I will not go to there.

01:17:51.980 --> 01:17:54.188
It's related to those branes
that are supersymmetric.

01:17:57.160 --> 01:18:01.380
Anyway, so these are the
mass over the-- essentially,

01:18:01.380 --> 01:18:04.370
this is the mass of
the brane, and these

01:18:04.370 --> 01:18:06.846
are the charge of the brane.

01:18:06.846 --> 01:18:10.560
When you specify the charge,
than those fields, then

01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:13.290
those flux that you
uniquely determined,

01:18:13.290 --> 01:18:17.720
and then the C4 potential
uniquely determined,

01:18:17.720 --> 01:18:20.024
up to gauge symmetry
are determined.

01:18:20.024 --> 01:18:22.065
And then now you can plug
into the generalization

01:18:22.065 --> 01:18:26.360
of the Einstein equation
to work out the geometry.

01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:31.440
So again, the symmetry
here-- I won't

01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:34.760
have time for the bottom
line, so that's OK.

01:18:34.760 --> 01:18:42.670
So the symmetry
preserved by the D-brane,

01:18:42.670 --> 01:18:47.080
by D3-brane as we said before,
similar to all D-branes

01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:51.020
is you have a Poincare symmetry
along the brane direction,

01:18:51.020 --> 01:18:52.697
and then you have
rotational symmetry

01:18:52.697 --> 01:18:54.530
in the transverse
direction along the brane.

01:18:54.530 --> 01:18:56.370
So the transverse we
have six dimensions.

01:18:56.370 --> 01:19:01.071
So there's SO(6) directions
you can rotate in the--

01:19:01.071 --> 01:19:03.070
and then you have Poincare
symmetry in the (1,3)

01:19:03.070 --> 01:19:04.320
direction.

01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:08.440
So based on these symmetries
you can write down

01:19:08.440 --> 01:19:10.280
what the metric looks like.

01:19:10.280 --> 01:19:12.680
You can write down
answers for the metric.

01:19:12.680 --> 01:19:14.350
Just like right here,
you can write down

01:19:14.350 --> 01:19:18.100
the answers for the metric
of a point particle based

01:19:18.100 --> 01:19:19.310
on symmetry.

01:19:19.310 --> 01:19:25.470
So here, if you can write down
the answers for the metric

01:19:25.470 --> 01:19:26.610
based on symmetry.

01:19:26.610 --> 01:19:31.350
So first, you should
have a part which

01:19:31.350 --> 01:19:34.700
is preserved Poincare symmetry.

01:19:38.460 --> 01:19:41.460
Means that this part
can only be this form.

01:19:41.460 --> 01:19:43.530
Say along the brane
direction, can only

01:19:43.530 --> 01:19:47.370
be this form times
some other factor which

01:19:47.370 --> 01:19:49.840
depends on r, so r is
the transverse radius

01:19:49.840 --> 01:19:51.600
from the brane.

01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:58.530
And then, the other dimension
must be spherical symmetric,

01:19:58.530 --> 01:20:00.350
so you can have
a lot of factors.

01:20:00.350 --> 01:20:06.180
And then the r squared
d omega 5 squared.

01:20:06.180 --> 01:20:08.830
So this is s5
surrounding the brane,

01:20:08.830 --> 01:20:10.690
and then this is the
radial direction.

01:20:10.690 --> 01:20:14.970
So this is the only
form of the metric.

01:20:14.970 --> 01:20:18.830
And then essentially, again, as
in the charged particle case,

01:20:18.830 --> 01:20:21.879
you need to determine
these two functions.

01:20:21.879 --> 01:20:23.670
Which you can plug in
the Einstein equation

01:20:23.670 --> 01:20:26.130
to determine these
two functions.

01:20:26.130 --> 01:20:28.380
So let me just write down
the form of those functions,

01:20:28.380 --> 01:20:32.758
then we discuss what
they mean next time.

01:20:38.750 --> 01:20:42.300
Some how, this year I'm
consistently much, much slower

01:20:42.300 --> 01:20:44.300
than what I did before.

01:20:44.300 --> 01:20:45.800
Maybe I'm explaining
physics better.

01:20:50.090 --> 01:20:53.430
Anyway, so now it's just
a mechanical exercise.

01:20:53.430 --> 01:20:56.790
You plug in these answers
into the Einstein equation,

01:20:56.790 --> 01:21:01.840
then you can find the two
equations for f and h,

01:21:01.840 --> 01:21:03.030
then you can solve it.

01:21:03.030 --> 01:21:07.850
In the old days, when Horowitz
and Strominger did it--

01:21:07.850 --> 01:21:09.610
maybe they did not
have Mathematica yet,

01:21:09.610 --> 01:21:11.240
but nowadays you can do it.

01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:14.110
Using Mathematica, if you
have the right program,

01:21:14.110 --> 01:21:16.340
you can do it in five minutes.

01:21:16.340 --> 01:21:18.870
But in the old days-- they
were friends with Wolfram,

01:21:18.870 --> 01:21:21.670
maybe they already have
the program at that time.

01:21:21.670 --> 01:21:27.310
Anyway, so it was a [INAUDIBLE]
exercise to do at the time.

01:21:27.310 --> 01:21:30.240
So you find actually the
answer is very simple.

01:21:30.240 --> 01:21:34.230
Turns out, both f
and h, they just--

01:21:34.230 --> 01:21:36.178
can be written in
the following form.

01:21:45.410 --> 01:21:47.435
H is just a harmonic function.

01:21:54.100 --> 01:22:06.850
And R to the power 4 is
given by some constant GN,

01:22:06.850 --> 01:22:11.960
Newton's constant times the
D3-brane tension times n.

01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:16.840
And it can also be written as
4 pi gs N alpha prime squared.

01:22:20.770 --> 01:22:23.080
So turns out that those
functions are very simple.

01:22:23.080 --> 01:22:26.610
They just square root
of a harmonic function.

01:22:26.610 --> 01:22:30.410
So this is a harmonic function
for the transverse R6.

01:22:30.410 --> 01:22:33.370
So if you solve a
coulomb problem,

01:22:33.370 --> 01:22:35.560
and that will be the solution.

01:22:35.560 --> 01:22:38.150
And this is the harmonic-- so
this is the generalization of 1

01:22:38.150 --> 01:22:40.070
over R potential.

01:22:40.070 --> 01:22:42.350
So this is just generalization
of 1 over R potential.

01:22:42.350 --> 01:22:46.460
And then f and g is very simply
related to this by square root.

01:22:46.460 --> 01:22:50.230
And this constant R to the power
4, so this is not curvature,

01:22:50.230 --> 01:22:53.260
this is just some constant.

01:22:53.260 --> 01:22:55.210
I'm using the standard notation.

01:22:55.210 --> 01:22:57.770
And then this can be--
this is just related

01:22:57.770 --> 01:23:00.830
to the mass of the brane.

01:23:00.830 --> 01:23:03.200
Mass of the brane, of
course, is proportional to n.

01:23:06.870 --> 01:23:07.370
Yeah.

01:23:07.370 --> 01:23:09.345
AUDIENCE: In this
case, is the mass,

01:23:09.345 --> 01:23:11.414
the charge is it massless?

01:23:11.414 --> 01:23:12.080
HONG LIU: Sorry?

01:23:12.080 --> 01:23:14.560
AUDIENCE: The
charge is massless?

01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:15.655
HONG LIU: Sorry?

01:23:15.655 --> 01:23:19.280
AUDIENCE: Is the charge
considered on the D3-brane

01:23:19.280 --> 01:23:23.210
brane massless or massive?

01:23:23.210 --> 01:23:24.660
HONG LIU: No.

01:23:24.660 --> 01:23:25.920
Charge are just charge.

01:23:25.920 --> 01:23:27.545
What do you mean by
charge is massless?

01:23:30.490 --> 01:23:34.210
This is just the charge
carried by this D3-brane.

01:23:34.210 --> 01:23:40.989
Anyway, so this R4 is just
like GN times the tension,

01:23:40.989 --> 01:23:41.780
N have the tension.

01:23:41.780 --> 01:23:44.070
We have n objects.

01:23:44.070 --> 01:23:46.580
So this is what you're
familiar with the Schwarzschild

01:23:46.580 --> 01:23:47.710
black hole.

01:23:47.710 --> 01:23:50.600
Schwarzschild metric just
using constant times mass,

01:23:50.600 --> 01:23:52.490
so this is just
generalization of that.

01:23:52.490 --> 01:23:55.090
The Newton constant times the
tension, and you have n-branes,

01:23:55.090 --> 01:23:56.610
we just multiply n.

01:23:56.610 --> 01:23:59.430
And you write it-- if you
write everything from gs,

01:23:59.430 --> 01:24:01.720
this is a proponent
to gs squared,

01:24:01.720 --> 01:24:03.490
this is a proponent
to one over gs,

01:24:03.490 --> 01:24:06.500
so and that, the thing's
proportionate to gs.

01:24:06.500 --> 01:24:07.700
OK.

01:24:07.700 --> 01:24:10.150
OK we'll stop here.
