00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.270
HONG LIU: OK, let us start.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:29.460
So last time, we
finished discussing

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:36.940
quantization of closed
strings and open strings.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:47.190
And we see-- we saw that if
you want to quantize strings

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.970
consistently in
Minkowski spacetime,

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:53.460
then you need 26 dimensions.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.110
We also saw that when you
quantize the photon-- when

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.350
you quantize open
strings, then you

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.410
see a vector field, a massless
vector field in the spectrum

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.600
plus an infinite of [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.880
And when you quantize
closed strings,

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.920
then you see massless
spin-2 particles,

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.440
which is a graviton in
your massless spectrum

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.940
plus infinite number
of [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.460
So that essentially is the
essence of string theory,

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.235
is that the strings
contain graviton

00:01:32.235 --> 00:01:33.740
in a quantum mechanical way.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.970
So it should be consistent--
should be considered

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.580
as a serial quantum gravity.

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.730
So today, we start talking
about another object

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.510
in string theory.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.000
It's called the D-branes.

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.190
OK?

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.350
So we discussed open
strings, so let's

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.136
go back to the open string.

00:02:05.136 --> 00:02:10.500
For the open string, say
after we fixed the [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.537
to be flat, the
[INAUDIBLE] action

00:02:14.537 --> 00:02:15.870
can be written as the following.

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.920
OK?

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.020
So you can-- when
you get the-- when

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:43.600
you obtain the equation
of motion for x,

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.830
you will have
something like this.

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:57.780
So you need to do an
integration by parts

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.130
plus a total derivative term,
or plus a total derivative term

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:07.160
until the derivative term we
induce a term on the boundary

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.285
if you have an open string.

00:03:21.931 --> 00:03:26.170
Say at sigma equal to 0 and pi.

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.670
OK?

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:35.280
So this is still d tau.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:44.230
And so from this term, you
get equation of motion.

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:50.406
And then you induce a
boundary term, evaluate it.

00:03:50.406 --> 00:03:55.110
If it's open string, there's
two boundaries, at 0 and pi.

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.350
To do such a boundary
term at the boundary,

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:01.840
we need to also get
rid of-- otherwise,

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.240
the equation of motion
is not satisfied.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.450
And what we discussed
is [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.850
Neumann boundary conditions.

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.410
It's just taking the pi of
sigma equal to 0, pi of sigma x

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.190
mu to be 0.

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:21.046
But in general, for
any mu, say for any mu,

00:04:21.046 --> 00:04:24.150
you have a choice of
four boundary conditions.

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.120
You can choose delta
x mu equal to 0,

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:33.550
or partial sigma
x mu equal to 0.

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:38.790
Say and sigma equal to 0.

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:42.030
And you have the same
choices at sigma equal to pi.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:49.020
So altogether, you have
actually four possible boundary

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.535
conditions for each direction.

00:04:51.535 --> 00:04:54.430
So for each direction, you
have four possible boundary

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:55.070
conditions.

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:56.861
If you can see the all
possible directions,

00:04:56.861 --> 00:04:59.510
there are many, many
different boundary conditions.

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:00.431
OK?

00:05:00.431 --> 00:05:02.680
There are, in principle,
many, many different boundary

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.190
conditions.

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.420
So let's now look at what the
other boundary conditions mean.

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:09.810
OK?

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.600
We looked at the case which
the-- you just imposed this

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:17.080
everywhere, at both sigma equal
to 0 and sigma equal to pi,

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.490
and the four directions.

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.750
But now let us explore
these more general boundary

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.430
conditions.

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:30.441
First let's just quickly look at
what this boundary-- so this is

00:05:30.441 --> 00:05:31.940
called Dirichlet
boundary condition,

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:33.537
this is called the Neumann.

00:05:33.537 --> 00:05:36.120
So first let's look at what does
this boundary condition mean.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:36.619
OK?

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:42.420
So if we have-- say let's
consider some direction,

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:45.740
i, set delta xi equal to 0.

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:55.200
Say at sigma equal to
0, say tau equal to 0.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.310
So this is the example of
this Dirichlet boundary

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:00.600
condition in the i direction.

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:07.040
Say suppose that sigma equal to
0, you have-- you impose this.

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:13.170
So what this means is that
the vibration of xi at sigma

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:16.030
equal to 0 at all
time does not change.

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:20.080
So tau is like a parameter
I should watch it-- time,

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.290
the watch it motion.

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:26.900
So this tells you that, at
all time, the value of the xi

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:29.730
does not change at the endpoint.

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:33.500
So what this means,
this directly

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:38.730
translates into xi
sigma equal to 0,

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:42.040
and tau should be a constant.

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.036
OK?

00:06:43.036 --> 00:06:45.690
Should be a constant.

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:47.630
So this is the
Dirichlet condition.

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:54.140
And so let's look
at some examples

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:58.960
to understand a little
bit more explicitly

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.900
what this kind of
condition-- want

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:04.080
this Dirichlet condition means.

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.360
OK?

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:08.010
So let's first
consider the example.

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:18.250
Say suppose in all directions,
say from 0 to d minus 2,

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:29.630
OK, we use-- suppose use
Neumann boundary condition

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:37.680
as what we did before for
both sigma equal to 0 and pi.

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.865
But for the last
coordinate, [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:40.865 --> 00:07:48.890
xt minus 1, so let's impose the
Dirichlet boundary condition.

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:54.970
So let's take it to be
A at sigma-- both sigma

00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:55.750
and 0 equal to pi.

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:56.250
OK?

00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:58.470
So for the moment, let's
take the boundary condition

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:03.830
to be same at both
sigma equal to 0 and pi.

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:07.020
So let's look at what
did this condition means.

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:08.465
Let's look at this example.

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:16.710
So what this condition means--
so let's draw a figure.

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:24.250
So, I cannot draw
many directions.

00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:28.250
In particular, I cannot
draw 6x26 dimensions.

00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:31.895
So let me call the
horizontal axis as all the--

00:08:31.895 --> 00:08:37.240
the connection of all the
dimensions up to d minus 2.

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:41.419
And under this axis
is the d minus 1.

00:08:41.419 --> 00:08:41.918
OK?

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:52.750
Then the endpoint, the x d minus
1 equal to a at the endpoint--

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:56.870
so suppose that this is
the line of x equal to a.

00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:07.955
So suppose this is the
hypersurface for x equals-- x d

00:09:07.955 --> 00:09:12.820
minus 1 equal to a, then that
boundary condition tells you

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:16.890
that whatever open
string the motion,

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:21.580
the endpoint must be restricted
to this hypersurface.

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:22.182
OK?

00:09:22.182 --> 00:09:23.890
So that's what this--
geometrically, what

00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:26.130
this condition means.

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:28.810
It just says, let's
consider xt minus 1

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:32.140
equal to a, which is a
hypersurface in spacetime,

00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:39.760
and then this condition means
that the endpoint of the string

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:42.660
must be restricted
to this surface.

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:44.180
The interior of
the string can be

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:47.680
any-- can be out-- can
have no restriction,

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:50.491
but the endpoint have
to be on this surface.

00:09:50.491 --> 00:09:50.990
OK?

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:51.573
Is this clear?

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:55.670
OK.

00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:57.990
So you can generalize.

00:09:57.990 --> 00:09:59.410
So this is the first example.

00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:00.300
You can generalize.

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:06.262
Let's consider x from
0 to some value, p.

00:10:06.262 --> 00:10:08.190
Of course, p is smaller
than the total number

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:15.120
of dimensions, which is n
for sigma at 0 and the pi.

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:28.170
And then the rest-- say xp plus
1, xp plus 2, to xp minus 1,

00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:34.600
these directions we impose the
Dirichlet boundary conditions.

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:39.580
And then let me call
this one back to a.

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:40.790
So I'm back to a.

00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:44.410
For both sigma
equal to 0 and pi.

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:44.940
OK?

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:47.460
So a is just some constant
vector of the same dimension

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:50.770
as the number of x here.

00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:53.270
The same as the
number of x here.

00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:55.660
And this is just
a more general way

00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:57.980
to impose this to
more directions.

00:10:57.980 --> 00:10:58.480
OK?

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:06.280
Is this notation clear?

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:06.780
Yes?

00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:09.750
AUDIENCE: Why is there
a repeated superscript?

00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:11.370
HONG LIU: Oh, sorry.

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:12.680
It's p plus 2.

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:17.806
Yes?

00:11:17.806 --> 00:11:19.180
AUDIENCE: Maybe
do we talk about,

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:21.431
like, a different
0 pi behaviors,

00:11:21.431 --> 00:11:22.555
or is that not interesting?

00:11:22.555 --> 00:11:24.138
HONG LIU: No, we
will talk about that.

00:11:24.138 --> 00:11:26.200
Let's look at the
simple case first.

00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:32.680
So is this notation clear?

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:38.660
So again, I can do this on
the similar plots like this.

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:45.140
So now horizontal axis
[INAUDIBLE] x 0 to p,

00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:49.750
and the vertical
axis I do p plus 1

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:51.850
all the way to d minus 1.

00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:55.270
So now those axes are
multiple dimensional.

00:11:55.270 --> 00:12:03.550
And then this
specifies-- so this a

00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:14.480
specifies a p plus 1 dimensional
hypersurface-- surface.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.010
So the value of those
coordinates are fixed,

00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:30.550
but the value of those
coordinates can be arbitrary.

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:33.816
So this p plus 1
free parameter here.

00:12:33.816 --> 00:12:35.040
OK?

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:38.330
And so this is a p plus
1 dimensional surface

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:40.130
in the spacetime.

00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:44.870
And this condition
means that the endpoint

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:49.180
of whatever open string must
be restricted to this surface.

00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:55.630
OK?

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:02.260
Is the picture clear?

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:14.190
Yes?

00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:17.340
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:18.105
HONG LIU: Hmm?

00:13:18.105 --> 00:13:18.680
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:19.390
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:21.540
We are talking
about how to impose

00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:24.450
the-- what's the meaning of
imposing the Dirichlet boundary

00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:26.650
condition.

00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:29.340
Instead of Neumann
boundary condition.

00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:31.530
So we now impose the
Dirichlet boundary condition,

00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:34.300
which goes one into the
[INAUDIBLE] of the endpoint

00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:36.440
should be 0.

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:39.280
And then this can be
specified by the endpoint

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:41.490
if you take some constant value.

00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:45.120
And so that's the
geometric way to think

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:48.015
about these different
Dirichlet boundary conditions.

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:59.230
So if you look at this
naively, so previously, when

00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:04.630
we can see the Neumann boundary
condition for all directions,

00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:09.720
then the string-- then there's
no restriction to the string.

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:12.360
Then the string
can move anywhere.

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:14.760
So now when you-- when
in some directions

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:17.220
we impose the
Dirichlet condition,

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:20.590
then we see that-- then
the motion of the string

00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:23.330
get restricted, and
that this endpoint now

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:27.410
have to [INAUDIBLE] some soft
dimension of the spacetime.

00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:29.500
OK?

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:32.390
So at first sight, this may
seem to be a nonsensical thing

00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:34.080
to do.

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:37.640
Just say-- you ask
why somehow I have

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:42.050
to restrict some open
strings to some sub-manifold

00:14:42.050 --> 00:14:44.430
in the spacetime.

00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:46.310
So why should I do that?

00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:49.167
In particular, that breaks
the Lorentz symmetry.

00:14:49.167 --> 00:14:50.750
In particular, that
breaks Lorentzian.

00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:55.080
So the nice thing about the
Neumann boundary condition

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:58.160
we did before, in more
directions, so that

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:00.520
respects Lorentz symmetry.

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:03.660
And once we introduce some
directions to the Dirichlet

00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:05.520
boundary condition,
you necessarily

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:12.080
break Lorentz symmetry, because
we select out some directions

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:13.320
with some others.

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:14.770
OK?

00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:17.620
And so you necessarily
break Lorentz symmetry.

00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:22.520
You also break translation
symmetry because of the-- you

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:24.390
have to specify
some sub-manifold.

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:28.500
You also break the
translation symmetry.

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:32.420
So at first sight, this seems
to be a nonsensical thing to do.

00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:35.080
So that's why, for many
years, actually people did not

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:42.170
look at this object,
even though for a person

00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:46.990
to work out string
theory on the first day,

00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:50.354
you should already realize those
are the boundary conditions.

00:15:50.354 --> 00:15:51.770
But for many years,
people did not

00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:54.582
pay attention to this kind
of boundary conditions.

00:15:54.582 --> 00:15:59.680
It turns out that
standard of conditions

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:03.410
plays a key role
in string theory.

00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:09.640
And the key is to take a
slight different perspective

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:11.650
at [INAUDIBLE] sub-manifold.

00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:13.910
OK?

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:16.070
So now what you
should think about

00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:20.490
is-- and now what you think
about is the following.

00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:28.350
So you think about maybe
for the whole spacetime,

00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:32.200
the whole spacetime,
only closed string

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:35.525
is the most natural object,
because it can move anywhere.

00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:42.930
But then there's
some special places

00:16:42.930 --> 00:16:47.860
in the spacetime,
some kind of defect.

00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:50.690
And at those defect,
the closed string

00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:53.490
can break to become open string.

00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:54.640
OK?

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:56.840
Can become open string.

00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:59.017
And if you take
that perspective,

00:16:59.017 --> 00:17:00.850
then that gives special
meaning to such kind

00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:03.950
of special sub-manifold
which open string can end,

00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:07.000
then there's some
kind of object there.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.119
Because of the existence
of certain object there,

00:17:10.119 --> 00:17:15.450
then the open string
can end there.

00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:16.290
OK?

00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:16.834
Yes.

00:17:16.834 --> 00:17:19.459
AUDIENCE: So indeed, if you have
that perspective, then instead

00:17:19.459 --> 00:17:22.530
of having it lie
along hyperplanes,

00:17:22.530 --> 00:17:24.200
is it more natural
to have it just lie

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:25.241
upon some other manifold?

00:17:25.241 --> 00:17:27.047
HONG LIU: Oh, you
can-- yeah, I'm

00:17:27.047 --> 00:17:28.630
just taking you--
I'm just sending you

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:29.420
the simplest example.

00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:30.294
AUDIENCE: Sure, sure.

00:17:30.294 --> 00:17:32.960
HONG LIU: And once you realize
in this simple example,

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:35.160
then you can generalize
the [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:37.890
complicated scenario
you can imagine.

00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:43.320
Now let's just think about,
in the simplest case, imposing

00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:47.220
those boundary
conditions become natural

00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:52.640
if you think those
places in spacetime

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:57.380
are special places which
something can happen.

00:17:57.380 --> 00:18:00.710
It's not the same
as other places.

00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:05.390
And to say those
[INAUDIBLE] give a name.

00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:11.250
So you imagine--
so for example, you

00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:36.600
can imagine some spacetime
defect sitting at, say,

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:46.425
this xp plus 1, x equal to
a, sitting at that location.

00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:52.170
So where open string can end.

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:06.590
So such a defect,
we'll call it D-brane.

00:19:11.895 --> 00:19:12.520
We give a name.

00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:25.730
So D is clear because
it's Dirichlet boundary

00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:28.820
condition, and the brane because
it's some extended surface.

00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:29.320
OK?

00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:39.080
And so we often use a
notation to say Dp-brane.

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:46.550
So p denotes the [INAUDIBLE]
spatial dimensions

00:19:46.550 --> 00:19:47.750
along the brane.

00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:48.580
OK?

00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:51.490
So in this case, there's
p spatial dimensions

00:19:51.490 --> 00:20:00.360
along the plane-- along this
brane, so we call it Dp-brane.

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:00.860
OK?

00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:17.330
So right now, Dp-brane
is merely just a place

00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:19.620
which impose a boundary
conditions which

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:24.750
open strings can end.

00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:28.610
But we will soon see
that actually a Dp-brane

00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:32.900
is a dynamic object, and it's
actually a dynamic object.

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:36.770
And this actually can move,
can fluctuate, can jump around,

00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:37.730
et cetera.

00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:39.790
OK?

00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:44.070
And so also from
this perspective,

00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:46.295
our previous Neumann
boundary condition,

00:20:46.295 --> 00:20:50.950
if we have Neumann
in all direction,

00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:59.060
so if we have Neumann boundary
condition in all directions,

00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:03.925
then in this case the open
string can end everywhere.

00:21:10.229 --> 00:21:10.770
End anywhere.

00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:27.690
From this new perspective, we
call this space-filling brane.

00:21:27.690 --> 00:21:30.620
We call this actually
a space-filling brane.

00:21:34.241 --> 00:21:34.740
OK?

00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:40.610
So the Dirichlet boundary--
the Neumann boundary condition

00:21:40.610 --> 00:21:43.530
we considered before should
be considered as actually you

00:21:43.530 --> 00:21:46.040
fill the whole spacetime
with such a brane,

00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:50.219
and then the string can, in
principle, move anywhere.

00:21:50.219 --> 00:21:51.760
So for example, in
the bosonic string

00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:57.150
we talked about before, this
group because one and two

00:21:57.150 --> 00:22:02.440
are D 25 brane, so D 25
brane because there's

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:04.980
25 spatial dimensions.

00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:06.750
OK?

00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:08.920
Such a brane when you
impose the Neumann boundary

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:10.800
condition in all directions.

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:14.050
Or if you are in the
super string, which

00:22:14.050 --> 00:22:18.480
the total number
of spacetime is 10,

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:21.740
and then the spatial number--
spatial dimension is nine,

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:24.560
then you have D9-- then
these other D9 branes.

00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:37.893
Any questions about this?

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:48.820
Yes?

00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:51.634
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
boundary conditions,

00:22:51.634 --> 00:22:54.448
they're imposed at the
quantum level, right?

00:22:54.448 --> 00:22:57.116
It's not just that the
classical solution has

00:22:57.116 --> 00:23:00.044
to have its endpoints
on this D-brane,

00:23:00.044 --> 00:23:02.484
but it's the fluctuations
around it [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:02.484 --> 00:23:03.894
solution that we consider?

00:23:03.894 --> 00:23:05.310
HONG LIU: We will
talk about that.

00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:06.375
We will talk about that.

00:23:14.137 --> 00:23:14.970
Any other questions?

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:21.390
Good.

00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:23.080
So let me make a note.

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:28.620
You can, in principle,
impose the Dirichlet boundary

00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:33.600
condition in any
direction you like, except

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:34.650
in the x0 direction.

00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:49.010
OK?

00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:51.290
It's because x0
cannot be a constant.

00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:56.620
x0 have-- so x0 is a
time, is our real time

00:23:56.620 --> 00:23:58.690
in the Minkowski space.

00:23:58.690 --> 00:24:03.080
So the string moves in
this Minkowski spacetime,

00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:06.240
and this x0 is that time.

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:08.420
And the time cannot stand still.

00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:09.310
OK?

00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:13.610
And in order to have this,
you needed that location

00:24:13.610 --> 00:24:15.330
to stand still.

00:24:15.330 --> 00:24:18.300
And the time cannot stand still.

00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:20.620
So this cannot be a constant.

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:31.130
So you cannot impose the
Dirichlet boundary condition

00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:33.310
in the time direction.

00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:37.690
So the smallest in the Minkowski
spacetime, the smallest

00:24:37.690 --> 00:24:43.170
would be at D0 brane, which we
impose the Dirichlet boundary

00:24:43.170 --> 00:24:48.080
condition in all spatial
directions except in time.

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:51.120
In time, you always
impose the Neumann.

00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:54.060
Then the smallest
situation will be called

00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:58.770
D0 brane, which is a point.

00:24:58.770 --> 00:25:01.275
And then the open string
can end on this point.

00:25:04.448 --> 00:25:04.948
OK?

00:25:16.390 --> 00:25:16.890
Yes?

00:25:16.890 --> 00:25:18.100
AUDIENCE: So I have question.

00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:23.255
So this idea about calling the
Neumann boundary conditions

00:25:23.255 --> 00:25:26.060
to D25 branes or D9 branes.

00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:28.030
So this is a little
bit perplexing,

00:25:28.030 --> 00:25:31.786
because it seems like not
imposing Dirichlet boundary

00:25:31.786 --> 00:25:34.841
conditions, this implies that
not imposing Dirichlet boundary

00:25:34.841 --> 00:25:37.708
conditions is equivalent to
applying Neumann boundary

00:25:37.708 --> 00:25:40.230
conditions, which is not--
they're not, like-- I mean,

00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:41.840
they're like mutually exclusive.

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:43.520
It's not like--
so I mean, I don't

00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:47.090
understand why it is that--
so does this thing behave

00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:48.350
like a 24 brane?

00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:50.934
Like, does it have the same
properties as, like, a 24 brane

00:25:50.934 --> 00:25:51.892
or something like that?

00:25:51.892 --> 00:25:53.550
HONG LIU: Sorry, which?

00:25:53.550 --> 00:25:54.300
You mean 25 brane.

00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:57.254
AUDIENCE: So what I'm saying is
that it seems that the Neumann

00:25:57.254 --> 00:25:59.170
boundary conditions have
a different character

00:25:59.170 --> 00:26:00.770
than-- like a
different flavor of how

00:26:00.770 --> 00:26:02.935
they work than the Dirichlet
boundary conditions.

00:26:02.935 --> 00:26:05.060
So it just seems strange
to me that you would still

00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:07.855
call it a brane, like a D 25
brane when you impose them

00:26:07.855 --> 00:26:08.592
or not.

00:26:08.592 --> 00:26:10.730
HONG LIU: No.

00:26:10.730 --> 00:26:16.340
So in those cases, in
those cases-- for example,

00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:19.710
in this case, which we Neumann
boundary conditions in all

00:26:19.710 --> 00:26:22.420
the other directions
except one, then

00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:24.790
this is a 24
dimensional-- then this

00:26:24.790 --> 00:26:30.110
is a 25 dimensional manifold
which the string can end on.

00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:31.889
And I just--

00:26:31.889 --> 00:26:33.180
AUDIENCE: Oh, I see, of course.

00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:33.450
So, right.

00:26:33.450 --> 00:26:35.560
You have to apply the Neumann
boundary conditions to all

00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:36.643
of the other [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:36.643 --> 00:26:37.590
OK, I understand.

00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:37.820
Yeah.

00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:38.945
HONG LIU: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:26:38.945 --> 00:26:40.427
Yeah, so it's-- yeah.

00:26:40.427 --> 00:26:41.260
Any other questions?

00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:50.890
OK, good.

00:26:50.890 --> 00:26:53.000
So now let's consider
more complicated--

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.150
slightly more complicated
boundary conditions.

00:26:56.150 --> 00:27:00.180
So by introducing
this D-brane, now you

00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:06.240
can actually have all different
possible boundary conditions.

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:08.980
As we said here, there--
for each direction,

00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:13.150
you can have in principle
four possible choices.

00:27:13.150 --> 00:27:15.997
And then if you
have [INAUDIBLE],

00:27:15.997 --> 00:27:17.330
so for time direction you don't.

00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:20.840
But for the 25 dimensions,
25 spatial dimensions.

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:23.100
And each dimension,
you have four choices,

00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:26.450
and you have four to the
power 25 possible choices

00:27:26.450 --> 00:27:28.690
of different
boundary conditions.

00:27:28.690 --> 00:27:31.810
Now let's talk about the
other boundary conditions.

00:27:31.810 --> 00:27:35.680
So by using the
picture of D-brane,

00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:38.610
we can talk about them all.

00:27:38.610 --> 00:27:39.835
We can talk about them all.

00:27:44.350 --> 00:27:51.630
So then let's consider
model 1 branes.

00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:03.730
OK?

00:28:03.730 --> 00:28:07.960
So let's consider the situation
we have two such Dp-brane.

00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:19.730
So this direction is
still x1-- x01 to p.

00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:26.040
And then this is all
the other directions.

00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:34.900
So suppose we have a brane
at a and another brane at b,

00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:37.645
at the vector specified by b.

00:28:40.590 --> 00:28:42.230
OK?

00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:46.880
So now in this case, we can
have four types of open strings.

00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:01.620
We can have four
types of open strings.

00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:06.080
For example, I can have an
open string which ends of b.

00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:09.860
I'm going to have an
open string end on a.

00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:13.110
But then I can also
have an open string

00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:17.350
which goes from b to a, and
for open string from a to b.

00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:26.280
OK?

00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:28.430
So in this case, the
boundary condition

00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:34.400
would be the x01 to p is
still a Neumann boundary

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:40.610
condition for both sigma equal
to 0 and sigma equal to pi.

00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:53.040
But for the other
directions, you

00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:58.120
can have either-- your sigma
0 can either be in a or b.

00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:04.525
Or sigma, you could do
pi can either be a or b.

00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:13.550
So that gives you the
four types of strings.

00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:18.297
OK?

00:30:18.297 --> 00:30:20.255
That gives you four types
of different strings.

00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:30.786
Now you also can see the
branes of different dimensions.

00:30:30.786 --> 00:30:32.660
So now you can see the
branes of [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:52.930 --> 00:30:57.440
So for example, say
suppose let's think

00:30:57.440 --> 00:31:02.261
of the two directions,
D minus 2 and D minus 1.

00:31:02.261 --> 00:31:04.010
And let's suppose all
the other directions

00:31:04.010 --> 00:31:06.600
are in the Neumann direction.

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:08.890
So this can see the
two kinds of branes.

00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:13.960
One is extended in the D
minus 2 direction [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:17.261
some value of D minus 1.

00:31:17.261 --> 00:31:18.870
And then you can
see another brane,

00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:23.440
which is localized in both
D minus 1 and D minus 2.

00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:23.940
OK?

00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:37.390
Then you can again have
four types of strings.

00:31:37.390 --> 00:31:43.800
[INAUDIBLE] and the
ending between these two.

00:31:47.697 --> 00:31:49.530
So again, you can see
the [INAUDIBLE] string

00:31:49.530 --> 00:31:51.279
because we can see the
[INAUDIBLE] string.

00:31:51.279 --> 00:31:54.630
So you can again see
the string like that.

00:31:57.430 --> 00:32:03.520
So let me call this
brane 1, this brane 2.

00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:07.210
So let's consider
the 1-2 string.

00:32:07.210 --> 00:32:09.150
It reaches from 1 to 2.

00:32:09.150 --> 00:32:13.040
Then the 1-2 string, with the
corresponding to the boundary

00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:22.670
condition, say at D minus
2, say at sigma equal to 0,

00:32:22.670 --> 00:32:30.450
you impose the Neumann
boundary condition

00:32:30.450 --> 00:32:36.660
because it can move freely
in the D minus 2 direction.

00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:44.140
And but in the-- at
sigma equal to pi, then

00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:46.280
this should be
fixed at some value.

00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:50.115
So let's suppose,
say, this is a 1, b1.

00:32:52.790 --> 00:32:55.040
Then add to that,
we are fixed at a1.

00:32:57.321 --> 00:32:57.820
OK?

00:32:57.820 --> 00:32:59.030
So this is 1-2 string.

00:32:59.030 --> 00:33:01.907
Then you can have one end
which is a Neumann boundary

00:33:01.907 --> 00:33:04.240
condition, but the other end
which is Dirichlet boundary

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:04.740
condition.

00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:07.900
OK?

00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:09.280
Is this clear to you?

00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:13.870
And then for this 2-1 string
that will be opposite,

00:33:13.870 --> 00:33:16.870
for the 2-1 string for the
D minus 2 direction at sigma

00:33:16.870 --> 00:33:19.640
equal to 0 will be the
Dirichlet condition,

00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:22.070
but at sigma equal to pi would
be the Neumann condition.

00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:38.940
Any questions about this?

00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:41.630
So these are pretty simple.

00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:46.770
You just need to get used to
it and spend a couple minutes

00:33:46.770 --> 00:33:48.200
drawing a couple of diagrams.

00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:50.450
Then you will be an expert.

00:33:50.450 --> 00:33:51.877
You will be an expert.

00:33:51.877 --> 00:33:52.960
This is pretty elementary.

00:33:56.647 --> 00:33:57.480
So important remark.

00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:12.760
So a Dp-brane, as
we said before,

00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:14.190
it breaks translation symmetry.

00:34:27.010 --> 00:34:29.239
Translation and the
Lorentz symmetries.

00:34:40.032 --> 00:34:40.532
OK?

00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:54.570
Of the original Minkowski
spacetime to your sub-group.

00:34:54.570 --> 00:34:58.630
So the subgroup is
that you have-- still

00:34:58.630 --> 00:35:01.700
have translational symmetry
and the Lorentz symmetry

00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:03.980
along the brane direction.

00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:06.080
So along the brane
direction, you still

00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:08.330
can translate-- your
string can still

00:35:08.330 --> 00:35:09.990
translate in that direction.

00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:13.350
And there's still Lorentz
symmetry in that direction.

00:35:13.350 --> 00:35:18.000
So there's still Poincare
symmetry in 1,p-- 1 comma p--

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.620
so in the time and the p spatial
dimensions along the brane.

00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:25.890
And then you have rotational
symmetries in the direction

00:35:25.890 --> 00:35:27.570
transverse to the brane.

00:35:27.570 --> 00:35:31.120
So that's D minus 1 minus p.

00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:36.550
So that's the rotation
among those coordinates.

00:35:36.550 --> 00:35:38.050
So you can have the
Lorentz symmetry

00:35:38.050 --> 00:35:40.660
along those directions,
then the rotational symmetry

00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:41.751
is along those directions.

00:35:41.751 --> 00:35:42.250
OK?

00:35:42.250 --> 00:35:43.920
So this is for Dp-brane.

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:47.495
So this is the
remaining symmetry.

00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:54.590
So this is remaining
symmetry say if you have

00:35:54.590 --> 00:35:58.275
a Dp-brane in the spacetime.

00:35:58.275 --> 00:36:01.850
Of course, if you have
multiple Dp-brane, et cetera,

00:36:01.850 --> 00:36:05.480
then it's broken even more.

00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:05.980
Yes?

00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:11.980
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] branes
are [INAUDIBLE] open not

00:36:11.980 --> 00:36:12.480
[INAUDIBLE].

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:13.440
HONG LIU: Oh.

00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:15.259
Yeah, we can talk--
here, I'm just

00:36:15.259 --> 00:36:16.800
talking about the
simplest situation.

00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:18.890
I'm imposing the simplest
boundary condition, just

00:36:18.890 --> 00:36:21.060
like these kind of
boundary conditions.

00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:23.170
And then these kind
of boundary conditions

00:36:23.170 --> 00:36:26.380
is-- applies to the
infinite-- yeah,

00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:29.620
you can-- once later we
talk about the D-brane can

00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:32.010
be dynamically excited, then
you can see the complicated

00:36:32.010 --> 00:36:34.830
configurations.

00:36:34.830 --> 00:36:35.810
Yes?

00:36:35.810 --> 00:36:43.650
AUDIENCE: So [INAUDIBLE]
boundary condition [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:43.650 --> 00:36:44.630
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:59.392
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
x plus [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:59.392 --> 00:37:00.615
HONG LIU: Ah.

00:37:00.615 --> 00:37:02.320
You are saying
something like this--

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:05.060
you're saying some
combination of this?

00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:07.360
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
x plus [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:08.920
HONG LIU: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:11.540
That can happen.

00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:14.930
That does not happen in the
straight Minkowski space,

00:37:14.930 --> 00:37:16.840
because in the straight
Minkowski space

00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:18.360
this is the action.

00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:21.720
So you only have
one or the other.

00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:25.510
But if you, say, have
Minkowski but you

00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:30.070
turn on some
electric field, then

00:37:30.070 --> 00:37:33.000
you can actually have such kind
of mixed boundary conditions.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:33.500
Yeah.

00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:37.260
Just they exist-- it depends
on the specific dynamical

00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:38.370
situation.

00:37:38.370 --> 00:37:42.179
So this is empty,
flat Minkowski space,

00:37:42.179 --> 00:37:44.220
then you can only have
those boundary conditions.

00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:45.648
AUDIENCE: And when [INAUDIBLE]?

00:37:50.884 --> 00:37:51.700
HONG LIU: Sorry?

00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:53.053
AUDIENCE: When [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:55.759 --> 00:37:58.252
HONG LIU: That I'm not sure.

00:37:58.252 --> 00:38:00.640
That is different.

00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:04.720
Yeah, because that does
not satisfy that boundary

00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:05.270
condition.

00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:08.912
And so we have a look at
the specific situation.

00:38:08.912 --> 00:38:12.100
We have to look at the
specific situation.

00:38:12.100 --> 00:38:13.830
Just for the flat
Minkowski space,

00:38:13.830 --> 00:38:16.490
these are the only boundary
conditions you can have.

00:38:16.490 --> 00:38:19.800
And we will not
have-- we will not

00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:22.820
be able to do it in
this course, but you

00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:26.942
can see the situation because
of the-- in open string,

00:38:26.942 --> 00:38:28.400
you can have
electromagnetic field.

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:29.316
You can have a photon.

00:38:29.316 --> 00:38:32.410
So you can, in principle, turn
on electromagnetic fields.

00:38:32.410 --> 00:38:34.199
And then we modify the
boundary condition.

00:38:34.199 --> 00:38:36.407
Then you can have actually
mixed boundary conditions.

00:38:39.536 --> 00:38:41.710
AUDIENCE: Do people
ever consider

00:38:41.710 --> 00:38:45.960
this is a [INAUDIBLE] between
two D-branes as a [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:46.850
defect?

00:38:46.850 --> 00:38:48.700
Because [INAUDIBLE] between--

00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:51.270
HONG LIU: You mean string
between different-- string

00:38:51.270 --> 00:38:53.020
before-- between
different D-branes.

00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:55.645
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:38:55.645 --> 00:38:57.800
HONG LIU: You can see that
the D-branes themselves

00:38:57.800 --> 00:39:01.400
have topological defect, rather
than the string between them

00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:03.480
has the topological defect.

00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:06.300
The D-branes
themselves are defects.

00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:10.340
Strings are just-- as we will
talk about-- we will talk about

00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:13.785
it now, the strings
on the D-brane,

00:39:13.785 --> 00:39:15.660
they're just the
excitations of the D-branes.

00:39:22.390 --> 00:39:25.610
So now after talking about
those boundary conditions,

00:39:25.610 --> 00:39:27.580
then we can again go
through the procedure

00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:32.580
of quantizing open strings
with those boundary conditions.

00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:33.785
Then we see what do we get.

00:39:54.110 --> 00:39:55.610
Now let's talk about
the open string

00:39:55.610 --> 00:39:57.810
spectrum on the Dp-brane.

00:39:57.810 --> 00:40:04.220
So as you can see already
from those pictures,

00:40:04.220 --> 00:40:09.410
because of the restriction on
the endpoints, so essentially

00:40:09.410 --> 00:40:12.090
those strings, they
can only move along

00:40:12.090 --> 00:40:14.520
the direction of the brane.

00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:16.920
They can only move in the
direction along the brane.

00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:21.320
So essentially, they
can be considered

00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:22.710
as living on the brane.

00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:23.530
OK?

00:40:23.530 --> 00:40:26.450
So those open strings are
living on those Dp-branes.

00:40:26.450 --> 00:40:27.340
OK?

00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:29.660
So when we quantize
those open strings,

00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:32.450
then we will get the excitations
of those open strings,

00:40:32.450 --> 00:40:35.170
the state of those open
strings, on the D-branes.

00:40:35.170 --> 00:40:35.670
OK?

00:40:38.450 --> 00:40:40.280
So let me first
introduce some notations.

00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:44.490
Previously, we have the notation
mu refers to all directions.

00:40:44.490 --> 00:40:47.960
So now I separate into
[INAUDIBLE] and a.

00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:52.520
And [INAUDIBLE] is the Neumann
boundary-- Neumann directions

00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:55.700
from 0 to p.

00:40:55.700 --> 00:41:00.420
And the a are the Dirichlet
directions from p plus 1 to D

00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:03.070
minus 1.

00:41:03.070 --> 00:41:06.290
So there's D minus
1 minus p of them.

00:41:06.290 --> 00:41:08.670
So D minus 1 minus p of them.

00:41:12.527 --> 00:41:14.110
So for the Neumann
boundary condition,

00:41:14.110 --> 00:41:17.980
it's just identical
to what we had before.

00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:20.780
So let me just write
it down to remind you.

00:41:47.190 --> 00:41:47.690
OK.

00:41:47.690 --> 00:41:51.600
So these are the, say,
the most general solution.

00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:55.410
So in this case in particular,
if you remember you have xa

00:41:55.410 --> 00:41:57.482
you could do xr.

00:41:57.482 --> 00:41:58.940
So the left moving
and right moving

00:41:58.940 --> 00:42:03.180
are the same, controlled
by the same function.

00:42:03.180 --> 00:42:06.410
And so that's why you get
this cosine sig cosine.

00:42:06.410 --> 00:42:09.180
And when you take the derivative
of a sigma becomes sine,

00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:10.730
then vanishes at the endpoints.

00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:11.230
OK?

00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:19.460
So for this story, it's just
exactly identical as before.

00:42:19.460 --> 00:42:24.380
So now let's look at the
Dirichlet conditions.

00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:28.300
So for the Dirichlet
conditions, let's again

00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:37.990
write down the most general
possible boundary conditions

00:42:37.990 --> 00:42:41.610
for Dirichlet boundary--
yeah, first write down

00:42:41.610 --> 00:42:46.710
the most general solution
for such a field.

00:42:46.710 --> 00:42:53.280
So you have xa then 2ipa tau.

00:42:53.280 --> 00:43:00.800
Then you have [INAUDIBLE]
tau [INAUDIBLE] sigma

00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:08.000
and [INAUDIBLE] sigma.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.130
OK?

00:43:10.130 --> 00:43:15.510
But now the boundary
condition we need to impose

00:43:15.510 --> 00:43:21.320
is xa at sigma
equal to 0 and pi.

00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:31.080
Sigma 0 tau and sigma
pi tau equal to ba.

00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:33.660
So here, I call them
a, but let me call them

00:43:33.660 --> 00:43:38.882
b because [INAUDIBLE]
write a to the index a.

00:43:38.882 --> 00:43:41.720
So let me just them
b, the vector b.

00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:43.629
OK?

00:43:43.629 --> 00:43:45.670
So now we have to impose
this boundary condition.

00:43:48.250 --> 00:43:51.480
So you can immediately see
that because of this boundary

00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:54.270
condition xa have to be ba.

00:43:56.990 --> 00:43:59.660
OK, xa have to be ba.

00:43:59.660 --> 00:44:01.430
And this pa have to be 0.

00:44:04.170 --> 00:44:06.670
pa have to be 0, otherwise you
won't satisfy this condition,

00:44:06.670 --> 00:44:09.780
because this changes with time.

00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:11.810
And then you want
the sum of them

00:44:11.810 --> 00:44:16.130
to be 0 at x equal
to-- sigma equal to 0.

00:44:16.130 --> 00:44:22.510
So that gives you xao
equal to [INAUDIBLE] xr.

00:44:22.510 --> 00:44:26.520
So this is from the boundary
condition at sigma equal to 0.

00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:27.740
OK?

00:44:27.740 --> 00:44:33.170
And then the boundary
condition is sigma equal to pi,

00:44:33.170 --> 00:44:36.370
you deduce both of them are
periodic boundary conditions.

00:44:36.370 --> 00:44:41.960
They are periodic
functions in 2pi.

00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:44.130
OK?

00:44:44.130 --> 00:44:47.510
They're periodic in 2pi.

00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:49.260
You can see it easily.

00:44:49.260 --> 00:44:51.810
So at the tau--
sigma equal to 0,

00:44:51.810 --> 00:44:55.760
we just have xr tau plus
xao tau equal to-- yeah,

00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:58.460
it should be equal to 0, so you
xao equal to [INAUDIBLE] xr.

00:45:04.610 --> 00:45:07.070
So now, you can just
write down explicitly

00:45:07.070 --> 00:45:10.730
just-- still, this is a
periodic function in 2pi,

00:45:10.730 --> 00:45:13.250
so the expansion is
essentially the same.

00:45:13.250 --> 00:45:19.690
So the only difference
for those directions

00:45:19.690 --> 00:45:23.220
is that now you
have b alpha, ba.

00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:26.460
Now you don't have this
term, because this term is 0.

00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:33.020
And then a not equal to 0
alpha [INAUDIBLE] divided by n

00:45:33.020 --> 00:45:37.670
minus [INAUDIBLE]
tau sine in sigma.

00:45:37.670 --> 00:45:41.020
OK, there's some pre-factors
here I forgot to write.

00:45:41.020 --> 00:45:43.270
Some alpha prime
[INAUDIBLE] by convention,

00:45:43.270 --> 00:45:44.740
let's not worry
about those things.

00:45:56.350 --> 00:45:56.850
OK?

00:46:01.420 --> 00:46:03.380
So now you do quantization.

00:46:06.970 --> 00:46:15.110
So the quantization in
Neumann boundary condition,

00:46:15.110 --> 00:46:18.950
of course identical
to before-- oh yeah,

00:46:18.950 --> 00:46:21.610
first let me just
explain the pa equal 0.

00:46:21.610 --> 00:46:24.340
I just want to make one remark.

00:46:24.340 --> 00:46:27.590
So this is, of course, expected.

00:46:27.590 --> 00:46:30.770
Because if the string is
limited in moving on this plane,

00:46:30.770 --> 00:46:33.590
then of course it cannot move
in the perpendicular direction,

00:46:33.590 --> 00:46:36.270
so cannot have central mass,
momentum in the-- so cannot

00:46:36.270 --> 00:46:39.320
have central mass, momentum in
the perpendicular direction.

00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:42.600
So this is indeed what
we intuitively expect.

00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:44.170
OK?

00:46:44.170 --> 00:46:48.370
The central mass momentum can
only be in the one direction,

00:46:48.370 --> 00:46:50.330
or can only be in the
Neumann directions.

00:46:53.257 --> 00:46:55.465
So the quantization of the
Neumann boundary condition

00:46:55.465 --> 00:46:57.820
is exactly the same as before.

00:46:57.820 --> 00:47:07.740
And actually, quantization
in Dirichlet directions

00:47:07.740 --> 00:47:14.535
which this is set up also the
same, also exactly the same.

00:47:18.350 --> 00:47:20.900
Because essentially the
only change is cosine

00:47:20.900 --> 00:47:22.040
sigma goes to sine sigma.

00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:24.280
You can walk through
that procedure,

00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:26.740
and you find that
nothing really changes.

00:47:26.740 --> 00:47:31.860
So it's exactly the
same as that of n.

00:47:37.231 --> 00:47:37.730
OK?

00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:47.490
In particular, the
commutation relations

00:47:47.490 --> 00:47:52.000
between all those modes
does not change at all,

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:53.600
just [INAUDIBLE]
exactly the same

00:47:53.600 --> 00:48:02.350
as what you would have
in the Neumann case.

00:48:02.350 --> 00:48:04.400
So this is also [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:10.000
This is [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:13.510
So imposing such
boundary conditions,

00:48:13.510 --> 00:48:16.570
essentially you're only
restricted to the central mass

00:48:16.570 --> 00:48:18.820
motion, so you can no longer
move in the perpendicular

00:48:18.820 --> 00:48:20.380
directions.

00:48:20.380 --> 00:48:22.220
But the string can oscillate.

00:48:22.220 --> 00:48:24.610
But string can still oscillate
in all 10 dimensions.

00:48:24.610 --> 00:48:27.990
There's no difference in the
way the string oscillates.

00:48:27.990 --> 00:48:31.560
And so strings still
oscillate in 10 dimensions,

00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:33.450
so everything is the same.

00:48:36.910 --> 00:48:37.730
Yeah.

00:48:37.730 --> 00:48:41.500
A string is still oscillating
in all directions.

00:48:41.500 --> 00:48:45.395
In particular, the zero
point energy is the same.

00:48:49.050 --> 00:48:51.110
Zero point energy on the
worksheet is the same.

00:48:51.110 --> 00:48:51.610
OK?

00:49:00.270 --> 00:49:04.330
So this means that the mass
formula we derived before

00:49:04.330 --> 00:49:07.410
for the Neumann
boundary condition

00:49:07.410 --> 00:49:10.560
will exactly apply
without any change.

00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:11.060
OK?

00:49:11.060 --> 00:49:13.396
Without any change.

00:49:13.396 --> 00:49:15.020
In particular, the
mass of the spectrum

00:49:15.020 --> 00:49:19.600
will also be essentially--
the mass of the spectrum

00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:23.992
will also be essentially
exactly the same as before.

00:49:23.992 --> 00:49:24.660
One second.

00:49:28.980 --> 00:49:38.910
So let me just mention one
point, that this is identical.

00:49:38.910 --> 00:49:40.840
This is identical.

00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:45.440
This is actually related to
that for the Dirichlet boundary

00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:47.550
condition on both sides.

00:49:47.550 --> 00:49:49.620
This is still a
periodic boundary--

00:49:49.620 --> 00:49:51.740
a periodic function in 2pi.

00:49:51.740 --> 00:49:54.810
And so you get this.

00:49:54.810 --> 00:49:58.710
In such a case, say if one
endpoint is the Neumann

00:49:58.710 --> 00:50:01.330
boundary condition
but the other endpoint

00:50:01.330 --> 00:50:03.090
is a Dirichlet
boundary condition,

00:50:03.090 --> 00:50:05.450
then the story is a
little bit more subtle.

00:50:05.450 --> 00:50:06.280
OK?

00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:12.420
And then you actually get
to the-- then the frequency

00:50:12.420 --> 00:50:16.040
of each modes become half
integer rather than integer.

00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:18.930
And then you will get the
difference [INAUDIBLE],

00:50:18.930 --> 00:50:21.370
and there the spectrum
will change, et cetera.

00:50:21.370 --> 00:50:23.400
OK?

00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:26.360
So I will not do it now.

00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:28.840
Maybe I will put it in
your [INAUDIBLE] p set,

00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:31.880
so that you can do it yourself.

00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:32.380
Yeah?

00:50:32.380 --> 00:50:33.213
You have a question?

00:50:33.213 --> 00:50:35.590
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
question was what happens

00:50:35.590 --> 00:50:37.970
when p equals 0 [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:41.302 --> 00:50:42.260
HONG LIU: Oh, yeah.

00:50:42.260 --> 00:50:43.840
Yeah, for the p
equal to 0, yeah,

00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:46.180
indeed it's a little bit
tricky to do the [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:46.180 --> 00:50:46.680
Yeah.

00:50:49.304 --> 00:50:51.720
Yeah, for p equal to 0, it's
tricky to do the [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:55.640
But you can do-- using other
quantization procedures,

00:50:55.640 --> 00:50:57.284
then you can do the same thing.

00:50:57.284 --> 00:50:59.700
Yeah, but the conclusion does
not change between different

00:50:59.700 --> 00:51:01.170
p's.

00:51:01.170 --> 00:51:02.150
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:02.150 --> 00:51:03.130
HONG LIU: Yes?

00:51:03.130 --> 00:51:05.907
AUDIENCE: Maybe I missed this,
but for the two different brane

00:51:05.907 --> 00:51:08.240
that you have a string going
from one brane to another--

00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:09.120
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:11.073
AUDIENCE: You said from a point
to a brane, the story changes.

00:51:11.073 --> 00:51:13.037
What about, like, from
one brane to another?

00:51:13.037 --> 00:51:15.640
Is it exactly the same
as this, or is it--

00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:19.700
HONG LIU: Oh yeah, that's
also a good question,

00:51:19.700 --> 00:51:21.580
which I might already
have something

00:51:21.580 --> 00:51:23.910
like this in the current p set.

00:51:23.910 --> 00:51:27.070
If not, it's something
I'll put in the next p set

00:51:27.070 --> 00:51:28.255
because you asked.

00:51:31.710 --> 00:51:35.380
Yeah, you see there's a
distance between them.

00:51:35.380 --> 00:51:38.581
So now you actually need
to include the sigma term.

00:51:38.581 --> 00:51:42.110
Now you actually need to
include the sigma term here

00:51:42.110 --> 00:51:44.180
to account this difference.

00:51:44.180 --> 00:51:47.710
Because now the 0 and the
pi is no longer the same.

00:51:47.710 --> 00:51:49.810
Yeah, here I don't need
to put in the sigma term

00:51:49.810 --> 00:51:51.540
because the 0 and
the pi are the same.

00:51:54.222 --> 00:51:56.074
AUDIENCE: So the zero
point would change--

00:51:56.074 --> 00:51:57.990
HONG LIU: Yeah, zero
point energy will change.

00:51:57.990 --> 00:52:00.810
And essentially, it's given
by the mass of the strings

00:52:00.810 --> 00:52:02.970
stretched between them.

00:52:02.970 --> 00:52:06.507
Yeah, so that's-- yeah, that's
a very instructive exercise.

00:52:06.507 --> 00:52:08.590
Actually maybe I already
put in the current p set.

00:52:08.590 --> 00:52:10.280
I don't remember.

00:52:10.280 --> 00:52:11.674
Anyway.

00:52:11.674 --> 00:52:12.340
Other questions?

00:52:17.060 --> 00:52:17.990
Good.

00:52:17.990 --> 00:52:20.626
So now let's look at the-- more
explicitly at the open string

00:52:20.626 --> 00:52:21.125
spectrum.

00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:56.860
So again, it's the same thing.

00:52:56.860 --> 00:53:04.260
You just [INAUDIBLE]
and 1, mu 1.

00:53:04.260 --> 00:53:14.930
You can act m1
times n k, mu k, mk.

00:53:14.930 --> 00:53:18.740
The only difference is
now your vacuum state

00:53:18.740 --> 00:53:22.850
is only-- can only have momentum
in the p alpha direction.

00:53:22.850 --> 00:53:24.970
That's essentially
the only difference.

00:53:24.970 --> 00:53:25.470
OK?

00:53:29.470 --> 00:53:32.640
And again, the mass
square now it just matters

00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:35.560
p alpha-- p alpha.

00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:39.680
OK, only around the
Neumann directions.

00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:42.990
So this is really--
then each mode

00:53:42.990 --> 00:53:46.950
on the string-- each
oscillation mode of the string

00:53:46.950 --> 00:53:53.200
now should really be
corresponding to a particle

00:53:53.200 --> 00:54:09.810
or field in p plus 1 dimensional
world-volume of the Dp-brane.

00:54:13.980 --> 00:54:14.547
OK?

00:54:14.547 --> 00:54:16.130
So we call-- this
is the world-volume.

00:54:16.130 --> 00:54:18.390
We call the directions,
all these directions

00:54:18.390 --> 00:54:22.480
together, as the
world-volume of the Dp-brane.

00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:27.180
So since the string can only
move along the Dp-brane,

00:54:27.180 --> 00:54:29.840
so they can only correspond
into the field of particles

00:54:29.840 --> 00:54:31.030
within the Dp-brane.

00:54:31.030 --> 00:54:32.910
They cannot move in
the opposite direction.

00:54:32.910 --> 00:54:35.455
They cannot move in the
perpendicular direction.

00:54:38.510 --> 00:54:39.240
OK?

00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:42.910
So [INAUDIBLE]
lives on the brane.

00:54:42.910 --> 00:54:43.410
OK?

00:54:46.150 --> 00:54:49.970
And in this-- then
all of those things

00:54:49.970 --> 00:54:55.260
may be considered as the
excitations of the branes.

00:54:55.260 --> 00:54:56.112
OK?

00:54:56.112 --> 00:54:57.036
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:57.036 --> 00:54:57.812
HONG LIU: Hm?

00:54:57.812 --> 00:55:00.270
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] string
can be part of the excitation.

00:55:00.270 --> 00:55:01.240
HONG LIU: Yeah, that's right.

00:55:01.240 --> 00:55:01.590
Yeah.

00:55:01.590 --> 00:55:04.173
Because you can excite certain
strings and not excite strings,

00:55:04.173 --> 00:55:05.156
et cetera.

00:55:05.156 --> 00:55:06.780
And they're all moving
along the brane.

00:55:12.150 --> 00:55:17.340
And the important thing
is that the states

00:55:17.340 --> 00:55:25.984
should fall into repetitions
now of this symmetry,

00:55:25.984 --> 00:55:27.775
because that's the only
remaining symmetry.

00:55:34.620 --> 00:55:41.590
[INAUDIBLE] when p
under the rotation

00:55:41.590 --> 00:55:44.650
in the transverse directions.

00:55:44.650 --> 00:55:45.150
OK?

00:55:48.870 --> 00:55:53.760
And again, just by
this, you can show

00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:58.290
that it actually makes sense
only in the 26th dimension.

00:55:58.290 --> 00:55:59.034
OK?

00:55:59.034 --> 00:56:00.950
Again, makes sense only
in the 26th dimension.

00:56:03.670 --> 00:56:07.680
So now let's again look
at the massless states.

00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:10.235
So as I mentioned before,
the mass [INAUDIBLE]

00:56:10.235 --> 00:56:12.360
exactly the same as before,
because the oscillation

00:56:12.360 --> 00:56:14.630
modes behaves exactly the same.

00:56:14.630 --> 00:56:17.730
So the mass [INAUDIBLE] exact
behaves the same as before.

00:56:17.730 --> 00:56:21.995
So the massless states,
that is the following.

00:56:25.511 --> 00:56:26.010
Yeah?

00:56:26.010 --> 00:56:28.860
AUDIENCE: When we say the
particles in [INAUDIBLE]

00:56:28.860 --> 00:56:29.970
dimensional world-volume--

00:56:29.970 --> 00:56:30.756
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:56:30.756 --> 00:56:36.975
AUDIENCE: But [INAUDIBLE]
particles [INAUDIBLE] object,

00:56:36.975 --> 00:56:38.800
whereas the open
string can-- you

00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:43.090
know, one end of the
open string located

00:56:43.090 --> 00:56:45.710
at one point [INAUDIBLE]
the other one [INAUDIBLE]

00:56:45.710 --> 00:56:47.110
very far away.

00:56:47.110 --> 00:56:49.130
But is that picture [INAUDIBLE]?

00:56:49.130 --> 00:56:51.540
HONG LIU: No.

00:56:51.540 --> 00:56:53.600
That's a good question.

00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:59.480
So when I say particles,
I'm talking about the center

00:56:59.480 --> 00:57:01.460
of mass motion.

00:57:01.460 --> 00:57:02.920
OK?

00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:04.855
Therefore, each
oscillation modes

00:57:04.855 --> 00:57:06.730
that you see, that's
corresponding to-- yeah,

00:57:06.730 --> 00:57:11.810
for particular
oscillation modes, then

00:57:11.810 --> 00:57:17.090
the-- other than those
quantum number-- yeah,

00:57:17.090 --> 00:57:17.970
let me finish this.

00:57:17.970 --> 00:57:20.584
I will answer that question.

00:57:20.584 --> 00:57:24.110
I will write this
down explicitly.

00:57:24.110 --> 00:57:26.330
So let's talk about
massless states.

00:57:26.330 --> 00:57:32.010
So again, using [INAUDIBLE].

00:57:32.010 --> 00:57:34.250
So again, we are
using the [INAUDIBLE].

00:57:34.250 --> 00:57:41.810
You can separate the [INAUDIBLE]
and i in the Neumann direction.

00:57:41.810 --> 00:57:44.640
And in the Dirichlet
direction, again it's

00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:47.216
just the p plus 1 to D minus 1.

00:57:47.216 --> 00:57:48.960
OK?

00:57:48.960 --> 00:57:52.120
And then the massless modes
would be the same as before.

00:57:52.120 --> 00:57:58.760
You have [INAUDIBLE]
1i acting on p alpha.

00:57:58.760 --> 00:58:03.660
And the alpha minus 1
a acting on p alpha.

00:58:08.160 --> 00:58:12.230
And the plus infinite number.

00:58:14.780 --> 00:58:18.570
Plus infinite number
of massless modes.

00:58:18.570 --> 00:58:20.880
OK?

00:58:20.880 --> 00:58:24.450
So let me just
illustrate this point.

00:58:24.450 --> 00:58:32.630
So this [INAUDIBLE] as
before, the [INAUDIBLE]

00:58:32.630 --> 00:58:36.466
further breaks this Poincare
symmetry to only a sub-group.

00:58:36.466 --> 00:58:37.840
But you can already
see from here

00:58:37.840 --> 00:58:40.970
this must be corresponding
to a vector particle.

00:58:40.970 --> 00:58:44.337
So this is like a
massless vector.

00:58:53.400 --> 00:58:54.260
Massless vector.

00:58:57.370 --> 00:59:01.770
Yeah, so to answer your
question, so example,

00:59:01.770 --> 00:59:05.040
for typical modes like this,
the only quantum number

00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:12.020
you have is p alpha and
this vector indices.

00:59:12.020 --> 00:59:14.970
This vector index.

00:59:14.970 --> 00:59:18.980
So from the perspective
of the quantum number--

00:59:18.980 --> 00:59:22.760
and this really is just
like a vector particle.

00:59:26.140 --> 00:59:27.450
Just like a vector particle.

00:59:30.180 --> 00:59:35.710
And then you can describe it
by a vector field, et cetera.

00:59:35.710 --> 00:59:38.210
It is very good question.

00:59:38.210 --> 00:59:43.260
Say suppose in this situation
which I have a string,

00:59:43.260 --> 00:59:45.590
suppose a string is
really very known.

00:59:45.590 --> 00:59:47.220
It's very big.

00:59:47.220 --> 00:59:51.160
Then I should be able to see
this one-dimensional structure.

00:59:51.160 --> 00:59:54.549
Indeed, then that
means that, even

00:59:54.549 --> 00:59:57.090
though this corresponding-- this
is just corresponding to one

00:59:57.090 --> 00:59:59.070
particular mode of the string.

00:59:59.070 --> 01:00:01.670
And to see the string structure
you have to be able to see,

01:00:01.670 --> 01:00:05.720
you can excite this into other
different modes, et cetera.

01:00:09.995 --> 01:00:13.125
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
stretch the string.

01:00:13.125 --> 01:00:13.873
HONG LIU: Yeah.

01:00:13.873 --> 01:00:15.030
AUDIENCE: I mean, [INAUDIBLE]--

01:00:15.030 --> 01:00:17.155
HONG LIU: Yeah, stretching
the string corresponding

01:00:17.155 --> 01:00:19.130
to exciting the string
in a different way.

01:00:19.130 --> 01:00:21.400
It means leaving this
particular state.

01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:22.640
AUDIENCE: Oh, I see.

01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:23.920
HONG LIU: Yeah.

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:25.470
I'm talking about
the interpretation

01:00:25.470 --> 01:00:27.710
of this particular
state, which is

01:00:27.710 --> 01:00:29.280
[INAUDIBLE] spacetime particle.

01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:33.180
AUDIENCE: Actually
this data conversely

01:00:33.180 --> 01:00:36.416
decided the other
configuration of--

01:00:36.416 --> 01:00:38.040
HONG LIU: Yeah.

01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:39.720
It determines all
the configuration.

01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:41.459
It determines all
the oscillation modes

01:00:41.459 --> 01:00:42.250
of the open string.

01:00:42.250 --> 01:00:43.624
Just the other
oscillation modes,

01:00:43.624 --> 01:00:45.850
they are all not excited.

01:00:45.850 --> 01:00:47.935
But of course, if
when [INAUDIBLE]

01:00:47.935 --> 01:00:49.560
this one-dimensional
object [INAUDIBLE]

01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:51.430
find the ways to excite them.

01:00:51.430 --> 01:00:53.170
And then you know this
is not a particle,

01:00:53.170 --> 01:00:54.878
it's a one-dimensional
object, et cetera.

01:00:56.845 --> 01:00:58.970
But in order to see this
one-dimensional structure,

01:00:58.970 --> 01:01:01.369
you have to probe the final
structure that just loads

01:01:01.369 --> 01:01:02.035
quantum numbers.

01:01:04.594 --> 01:01:06.760
If those are the only quantum
numbers you can probe,

01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:07.843
then [INAUDIBLE] particle.

01:01:13.630 --> 01:01:15.980
So this is the massless vector.

01:01:15.980 --> 01:01:21.730
But now those guys,
they have index a, which

01:01:21.730 --> 01:01:24.010
is not in the Poincare here.

01:01:24.010 --> 01:01:26.080
So those are now scalar fields.

01:01:31.910 --> 01:01:32.410
OK?

01:01:32.410 --> 01:01:36.585
Those are scalar fields on the
world-volume of the D-branes.

01:01:39.810 --> 01:01:40.900
OK?

01:01:40.900 --> 01:01:55.320
So now we find--
so previously, when

01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:57.670
we can see the all Neumann
directions, we only

01:01:57.670 --> 01:01:59.680
see a vector field.

01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:02.030
So moving more 26th dimension.

01:02:02.030 --> 01:02:06.820
But now-- so these
massless modes,

01:02:06.820 --> 01:02:15.750
they give rise to
a vector field,

01:02:15.750 --> 01:02:21.510
the massless vector
field A alpha,

01:02:21.510 --> 01:02:31.272
and D minus p minus 1
scalar fields phi a.

01:02:31.272 --> 01:02:31.772
OK?

01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:41.200
So essentially, when
you introduce D-brane

01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:43.340
compared to the space-fitting
brane cage, which

01:02:43.340 --> 01:02:47.360
we can see the before in
the Neumann direction,

01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:51.220
just some component
of those cage fields

01:02:51.220 --> 01:02:54.350
now become the oscillation
in the transverse direction,

01:02:54.350 --> 01:02:57.130
and now they just essentially
become scalar fields.

01:02:57.130 --> 01:02:57.630
OK?

01:02:57.630 --> 01:02:59.980
Is this clear?

01:02:59.980 --> 01:03:03.560
So now instead you have
a smaller vector field,

01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:05.570
plus a bunch of scalar fields.

01:03:10.100 --> 01:03:21.190
As we said before,
[INAUDIBLE] defective action,

01:03:21.190 --> 01:03:35.530
so the [INAUDIBLE] defective
action for such massless modes

01:03:35.530 --> 01:03:39.380
must be-- have the
structure, say--

01:03:39.380 --> 01:03:42.560
so this is in the p plus
1 dimensional world-volume

01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:47.370
of the string, say,
of a Maxwell series.

01:03:52.820 --> 01:03:57.160
And they're just the same
as with scalar fields.

01:04:00.210 --> 01:04:04.390
And then of course, they are
more complicated contributions.

01:04:04.390 --> 01:04:07.419
Just this is a no energy.

01:04:07.419 --> 01:04:09.085
Then the structure
of those excitations,

01:04:09.085 --> 01:04:11.970
they must be described by
this kind of low-energy factor

01:04:11.970 --> 01:04:14.012
series.

01:04:14.012 --> 01:04:15.470
And this is, again,
just determined

01:04:15.470 --> 01:04:17.220
by the universality
of massless modes.

01:04:26.390 --> 01:04:32.160
So now there's a
very-- so now let me--

01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:38.880
the first node-- let me
emphasize this point,

01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:45.260
is that the number of massless
modes, massless scalar fields.

01:04:50.020 --> 01:04:53.960
So we have such a
bunch of scalar fields.

01:04:53.960 --> 01:05:09.550
It's exactly the number
of transverse directions

01:05:09.550 --> 01:05:10.580
to the D-brane.

01:05:15.970 --> 01:05:17.365
OK?

01:05:17.365 --> 01:05:19.740
So essentially, associated
with each transverse direction

01:05:19.740 --> 01:05:21.550
you have scalar excitations.

01:05:21.550 --> 01:05:24.860
You have massless scalar fields.

01:05:24.860 --> 01:05:26.860
OK?

01:05:26.860 --> 01:05:28.340
So let me emphasize this point.

01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:41.820
So those scalar fields, some of
you maybe already have guessed,

01:05:41.820 --> 01:05:46.530
they have a very simple
physical explanation--

01:05:46.530 --> 01:05:52.090
they have a very simple
physical interpretation.

01:05:52.090 --> 01:05:53.880
And those scalar
fields, they can

01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:58.890
be considered as describing the
motions and the fluctuations

01:05:58.890 --> 01:06:02.211
of the D-brane in the
transverse directions.

01:06:02.211 --> 01:06:02.710
OK?

01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:10.080
So for each
transverse direction,

01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:13.320
you have such massless
scalar fields.

01:06:13.320 --> 01:07:13.110
And each of scalar
fields-- so more precisely,

01:07:13.110 --> 01:07:18.170
so more explicitly, just
as a cartoon picture,

01:07:18.170 --> 01:07:20.130
suppose let's
consider, say, the p

01:07:20.130 --> 01:07:24.010
minus 1 direction,
p plus 1 direction.

01:07:24.010 --> 01:07:27.120
This direction, p
plus 1 direction.

01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:30.280
So suppose you have a
D-brane sitting here

01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:32.520
at some value of a.

01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:34.290
OK?

01:07:34.290 --> 01:07:42.050
So when we impose the Dirichlet
boundary condition-- yeah,

01:07:42.050 --> 01:07:46.460
so those are the
x1 01 p directions.

01:07:46.460 --> 01:07:48.850
OK?

01:07:48.850 --> 01:07:50.670
Yeah.

01:07:50.670 --> 01:07:55.720
Yeah, this is the other
x0 and p directions.

01:07:55.720 --> 01:08:01.440
You have a D-brane sitting
here at some value of a.

01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:05.775
So when we impose the
Dirichlet boundary conditions,

01:08:05.775 --> 01:08:07.400
that boundary condition
does not depend

01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:09.160
on the value of x0 and p.

01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:11.010
So they're the same everywhere.

01:08:11.010 --> 01:08:16.439
So that's why I draw
it flat, exact flat.

01:08:16.439 --> 01:08:19.170
But now, if you have some
excitations in the phi

01:08:19.170 --> 01:08:22.460
p plus 1 direction,
so phi p plus 1

01:08:22.460 --> 01:08:29.100
is a field in the
world-volume of the half--

01:08:29.100 --> 01:08:32.370
can have p alpha momentum.

01:08:32.370 --> 01:08:34.470
You can go to coordinate space.

01:08:34.470 --> 01:08:39.689
Then their function's
just x1, xp.

01:08:39.689 --> 01:08:41.490
OK?

01:08:41.490 --> 01:08:43.580
xi, xp.

01:08:43.580 --> 01:08:49.920
And then the profile
of this phi essentially

01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:58.020
tells you that the D-brane--
say if you have a scalar field

01:08:58.020 --> 01:09:00.910
excitation like this, then
the shape of the D-brane

01:09:00.910 --> 01:09:04.290
actually is no
longer strictly flat.

01:09:04.290 --> 01:09:07.510
Actually have a profile
given by these scalar fields.

01:09:14.859 --> 01:09:18.750
So we are not justify
this precise--

01:09:18.750 --> 01:09:22.500
so this can be justified
mathematically to really show

01:09:22.500 --> 01:09:23.939
that this is the case.

01:09:23.939 --> 01:09:24.970
OK?

01:09:24.970 --> 01:09:27.279
And I will not do
that here, but let

01:09:27.279 --> 01:09:32.291
me just mention some
support for this picture.

01:09:36.219 --> 01:09:44.430
So-- OK.

01:09:44.430 --> 01:09:53.410
So first you can show
at [INAUDIBLE] level

01:09:53.410 --> 01:09:59.030
having such excitations-- OK?

01:09:59.030 --> 01:10:02.556
So having such excitations,
so we can just call it

01:10:02.556 --> 01:10:03.555
[INAUDIBLE] excitations.

01:10:09.990 --> 01:10:13.020
So this is a picture
in momentum space.

01:10:13.020 --> 01:10:21.560
[INAUDIBLE] excitations
modifies the Dirichlet boundary

01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:24.450
condition.

01:10:24.450 --> 01:10:25.010
OK?

01:10:25.010 --> 01:10:26.620
So this you can show explicitly.

01:10:32.690 --> 01:10:36.210
So this is first point, which
I will not go into there.

01:10:39.670 --> 01:10:43.360
And the second point is that
you can actually work out

01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:46.180
the precise pre-factor.

01:10:46.180 --> 01:10:52.110
There's a way, say by doing
string theory calculation,

01:10:52.110 --> 01:10:54.020
say by computing
the [INAUDIBLE],

01:10:54.020 --> 01:10:56.930
there's a way you
can actually work out

01:10:56.930 --> 01:10:58.620
the pre-factor,
precise pre-factor.

01:11:01.210 --> 01:11:06.500
So let me call this
the equation star.

01:11:06.500 --> 01:11:15.780
So you can actually work out--
so that was just by general--

01:11:15.780 --> 01:11:17.960
this is just by
general principle.

01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:20.390
Say if you have a massless
spectrum, then the [INAUDIBLE]

01:11:20.390 --> 01:11:22.750
must behave like this.

01:11:22.750 --> 01:11:25.580
But this pre-factor
is not fixed.

01:11:25.580 --> 01:11:27.720
OK?

01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:34.077
But you can actually, with
the interpretation phi,

01:11:34.077 --> 01:11:36.660
[INAUDIBLE] fluctuations of this
Dirichlet boundary condition,

01:11:36.660 --> 01:11:41.260
you can actually fix the
precise pre-factor here.

01:11:41.260 --> 01:11:55.690
So working out the
[INAUDIBLE] you

01:11:55.690 --> 01:11:58.665
can show that actually
this action can

01:11:58.665 --> 01:12:01.570
be written as the following.

01:12:01.570 --> 01:12:09.410
Tp-- again, it's integrated
only over the [INAUDIBLE]

01:12:09.410 --> 01:12:11.250
of the D-branes, p plus 1.

01:12:14.069 --> 01:12:15.860
And actually first we
find actually there's

01:12:15.860 --> 01:12:19.020
a constant term.

01:12:19.020 --> 01:12:21.420
We will call that
action precisely.

01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:35.120
And then you have this F term
under this-- and let me-- yeah,

01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:38.400
actually I should
have done it there.

01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:42.780
So there is a summation
a over here, right?

01:12:42.780 --> 01:12:54.406
So this Tp, this
pre-factor, is actually--

01:12:54.406 --> 01:12:56.030
we can work out the
precise pre-factor.

01:12:59.750 --> 01:13:10.504
And this pre-factor is given
by the mass of our Dp-brane

01:13:10.504 --> 01:13:11.170
per unit volume.

01:13:15.090 --> 01:13:18.590
Or in other words,
the brane tension.

01:13:18.590 --> 01:13:22.210
So I will explain where
does this come from, where--

01:13:22.210 --> 01:13:24.235
how do we define brane tension.

01:13:24.235 --> 01:13:26.030
But for now, let
me just introduce

01:13:26.030 --> 01:13:27.630
this concept of brane tension.

01:13:30.084 --> 01:13:31.500
So if you work out
the pre-factor,

01:13:31.500 --> 01:13:36.050
you find the pre-factor is
precisely the brane tension,

01:13:36.050 --> 01:13:37.270
OK?

01:13:37.270 --> 01:13:39.070
Brane tension.

01:13:39.070 --> 01:13:44.770
So now if you look at this
equation, so then this 1,

01:13:44.770 --> 01:13:47.840
it's just like a
static mass term.

01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:50.950
This 1 is like a
static mass term.

01:13:50.950 --> 01:13:55.420
So you also find this 1 in
this [INAUDIBLE] action.

01:13:55.420 --> 01:14:00.860
But this 1 is very important
because of the-- so this 1

01:14:00.860 --> 01:14:02.460
is like static term.

01:14:02.460 --> 01:14:05.790
And now if you
look at this term,

01:14:05.790 --> 01:14:11.850
so now if you consider the
situation which A alpha is

01:14:11.850 --> 01:14:15.170
equal to 0-- so you don't have
an excitation of the vector

01:14:15.170 --> 01:14:19.558
field, but phi a
only depend on t.

01:14:19.558 --> 01:14:21.040
Only depend on the time.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.670
And then this
effective action then

01:14:27.670 --> 01:14:34.620
will become Tp, then
the volume of the p,

01:14:34.620 --> 01:14:39.303
then dt 1/2 phi dot a square.

01:14:42.201 --> 01:14:45.110
OK?

01:14:45.110 --> 01:14:51.240
And so Vp is the
volume of Dp-brane.

01:14:56.710 --> 01:14:57.880
Volume of the Dp-brane.

01:14:57.880 --> 01:15:00.447
And this tension times
Dp-brane-- so this

01:15:00.447 --> 01:15:01.155
is just the mass.

01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:08.570
So this is just the mass.

01:15:08.570 --> 01:15:18.330
So you can rewrite this just
1/2 and p-brane phi dot square.

01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:29.330
And then D-brane [INAUDIBLE]
Tp times the volume.

01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:39.655
So you see, this is
precisely like a particle.

01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:46.600
Like the whole brane moving--
the [INAUDIBLE] motion

01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:50.620
moving of some object.

01:15:50.620 --> 01:15:51.660
OK?

01:15:51.660 --> 01:15:53.960
So again, this give
you the interpretation

01:15:53.960 --> 01:16:01.280
that the phi can be interpreted
as the [INAUDIBLE] describe

01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:04.240
the motion of the brane.

01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:04.740
OK?

01:16:30.390 --> 01:16:30.890
OK.

01:16:34.030 --> 01:16:35.850
So do you have any
questions about this?

01:16:35.850 --> 01:16:36.350
Yes?

01:16:36.350 --> 01:16:38.558
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
introduce the dynamics of brane

01:16:38.558 --> 01:16:39.308
from [INAUDIBLE].

01:16:46.210 --> 01:16:47.196
HONG LIU: Sorry?

01:16:47.196 --> 01:16:51.140
AUDIENCE: If we [INAUDIBLE]
brane [INAUDIBLE],

01:16:51.140 --> 01:16:53.605
then with the
pre-factors [INAUDIBLE].

01:17:03.310 --> 01:17:04.120
HONG LIU: No.

01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:07.600
Those pre-factors depend
on your normalization.

01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:10.230
Those pre-factors
depend on normalization.

01:17:10.230 --> 01:17:14.350
So you can normalize them
in some particular way.

01:17:14.350 --> 01:17:18.420
You can normalize
them-- here, what

01:17:18.420 --> 01:17:21.640
I'm saying is that there is a
specific normalization, which

01:17:21.640 --> 01:17:24.725
then the phi can
precisely be interpreted

01:17:24.725 --> 01:17:28.744
as the motion of the D-brane--
yeah, phi always corresponding

01:17:28.744 --> 01:17:31.285
to the motion of the D-brane,
but this specific normalization

01:17:31.285 --> 01:17:35.210
in phi can be really interpreted
as a dynamical version

01:17:35.210 --> 01:17:37.590
of this coordinate in
the transverse direction.

01:17:37.590 --> 01:17:39.600
And with that
normalization, then you

01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:42.610
see that this
[INAUDIBLE] action is

01:17:42.610 --> 01:17:46.241
like the motion of
a massive object.

01:17:46.241 --> 01:17:46.740
OK?

01:17:46.740 --> 01:17:50.670
It's like the motion
of a massive object.

01:17:50.670 --> 01:17:52.670
And this gives you
the confirmation

01:17:52.670 --> 01:17:55.560
that the phi indeed is
degrees freedom-- should

01:17:55.560 --> 01:17:58.600
be considered degrees
freedom to describe

01:17:58.600 --> 01:18:00.350
the motion of the D-brane.

01:18:00.350 --> 01:18:01.221
Yes?

01:18:01.221 --> 01:18:05.550
AUDIENCE: That's-- I mean, that
is only in the [INAUDIBLE].

01:18:05.550 --> 01:18:07.474
If that analogy
continued, [INAUDIBLE]

01:18:07.474 --> 01:18:10.360
higher excitations of those
closed-- open strings?

01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:11.880
HONG LIU: Yeah.

01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:14.370
So that's a good question,
which I don't have time

01:18:14.370 --> 01:18:18.320
to discuss now but
I can-- but I will

01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:21.540
describe at the beginning
of next lecture.

01:18:21.540 --> 01:18:24.600
So this is a no-energy story.

01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:28.520
Then you can actually include
a subset of higher-order terms.

01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:30.740
Then you find that
there's an infinite number

01:18:30.740 --> 01:18:33.020
of higher-order
terms you can sum,

01:18:33.020 --> 01:18:35.760
and then this precisely
generalize to the motion

01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:37.497
of a [INAUDIBLE] object.

01:18:37.497 --> 01:18:40.080
Yeah, because if you want to--
yeah, because this is no-energy

01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:42.310
[INAUDIBLE] have to
be non-relativistic.

01:18:42.310 --> 01:18:44.160
But then you can
generalize, generally

01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:48.050
if you sum over an infinite
number of higher terms, then

01:18:48.050 --> 01:18:51.930
this describes [INAUDIBLE]
motion of object.

01:18:51.930 --> 01:18:54.490
And again, that's another
independent confirmation

01:18:54.490 --> 01:18:58.020
that this is the-- describe
the motion of the D-brane.

01:18:58.020 --> 01:18:58.695
Yes?

01:18:58.695 --> 01:19:02.890
AUDIENCE: So I'm kind of
fundamentally confused

01:19:02.890 --> 01:19:05.320
about how-- so we started
with a D-brane which

01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:08.155
was a topological defect
in our background manifold.

01:19:08.155 --> 01:19:08.820
HONG LIU: Yeah.

01:19:08.820 --> 01:19:10.333
AUDIENCE: So like a
[INAUDIBLE] or something.

01:19:10.333 --> 01:19:11.060
HONG LIU: Yeah.

01:19:11.060 --> 01:19:14.654
AUDIENCE: And we are
looking at motion of strings

01:19:14.654 --> 01:19:15.820
in this background manifold.

01:19:15.820 --> 01:19:16.640
HONG LIU: Yeah.

01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:19.500
AUDIENCE: And this
is-- so why do

01:19:19.500 --> 01:19:23.475
we all of a sudden have
the string motion affect

01:19:23.475 --> 01:19:24.100
the background?

01:19:24.100 --> 01:19:26.570
Like we never even introduced
any coupling to the background.

01:19:26.570 --> 01:19:27.194
HONG LIU: Yeah.

01:19:27.194 --> 01:19:32.030
So that's precisely-- so
this is a very good question.

01:19:32.030 --> 01:19:38.150
This is precisely the remarkable
thing about this string theory.

01:19:38.150 --> 01:19:42.950
So yeah, so I was going
to say at the beginning

01:19:42.950 --> 01:19:46.570
of next lecture, but
now let me say it.

01:19:46.570 --> 01:19:50.650
So at the beginning, you
introduce the D-brane just

01:19:50.650 --> 01:19:53.150
by some rigid
boundary conditions.

01:19:53.150 --> 01:19:56.440
Some rigid boundary conditions.

01:19:56.440 --> 01:19:58.890
And looks like this is
a non-dynamical object

01:19:58.890 --> 01:20:02.840
because you are introducing
some rigid boundary conditions.

01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:07.120
But now, when you quantize
the strings under D-branes,

01:20:07.120 --> 01:20:13.830
and then you find that those
strings now give the D-brane

01:20:13.830 --> 01:20:15.435
itself [INAUDIBLE].

01:20:18.510 --> 01:20:20.857
AUDIENCE: Is it because
there's a graviton here?

01:20:20.857 --> 01:20:22.940
HONG LIU: No, it has nothing
to do with gravitons.

01:20:22.940 --> 01:20:24.148
[INAUDIBLE] do with graviton.

01:20:24.148 --> 01:20:27.150
Generally, you start with
rigid boundary conditions.

01:20:27.150 --> 01:20:30.360
But now you find [INAUDIBLE]
boundary conditions.

01:20:30.360 --> 01:20:33.620
Then you can generate-- then
you have some excitations.

01:20:33.620 --> 01:20:36.510
Then the coherent motions
of these excitations

01:20:36.510 --> 01:20:42.090
now give this object dynamics.

01:20:42.090 --> 01:20:45.015
So that's a precisely remarkable
thing about string theory.

01:20:45.015 --> 01:20:47.860
AUDIENCE: What if you have
two strings both ending

01:20:47.860 --> 01:20:49.286
on the same brane?

01:20:49.286 --> 01:20:50.207
HONG LIU: No, no, no.

01:20:50.207 --> 01:20:51.790
No, this is including
all the strings.

01:20:51.790 --> 01:20:54.205
You can have as many
strings as you want.

01:20:54.205 --> 01:20:55.830
AUDIENCE: Well I
mean, we're quantizing

01:20:55.830 --> 01:20:57.206
one particular object,
and we're looking

01:20:57.206 --> 01:20:59.242
at a spectrum of a single
string starting here--

01:20:59.242 --> 01:21:01.325
HONG LIU: Yeah, each string
have such excitations.

01:21:01.325 --> 01:21:03.270
AUDIENCE: But then
each different string

01:21:03.270 --> 01:21:05.330
will generate a different
dynamics for the--

01:21:05.330 --> 01:21:06.550
HONG LIU: No, they're
the same dynamic.

01:21:06.550 --> 01:21:07.320
We just have two particles.

01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:08.700
It's just like we
have one photon here,

01:21:08.700 --> 01:21:09.110
another photon there.

01:21:09.110 --> 01:21:10.022
It's the same thing.

01:21:14.130 --> 01:21:19.480
And this is the same thing about
how string theory generates

01:21:19.480 --> 01:21:21.440
gravity.

01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:25.010
So let me just say
a few words here.

01:21:25.010 --> 01:21:28.550
So at the beginning, when we
quantize the closed string,

01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:31.400
we can see the closed
string moving, again,

01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:35.320
in the rigid
Minkowski spacetime.

01:21:35.320 --> 01:21:37.280
Yeah, because that
[INAUDIBLE] region.

01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:41.010
We just consider in the
region in Minkowski spacetime.

01:21:41.010 --> 01:21:43.670
But now, when you quantize
that closed string,

01:21:43.670 --> 01:21:47.130
when you see that the closed
string actually half spin-2 two

01:21:47.130 --> 01:21:49.440
excitations.

01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:51.700
Half spin-2 excitations.

01:21:51.700 --> 01:21:56.610
That means that string actually
has gravitational effect.

01:21:56.610 --> 01:22:02.010
Unless you have spin-2
excitations, then

01:22:02.010 --> 01:22:06.430
Einstein-- already
from Einstein,

01:22:06.430 --> 01:22:11.662
gravity tells us that the
spacetime is no longer rigid,

01:22:11.662 --> 01:22:15.380
that actually you can
deform the Minkowski

01:22:15.380 --> 01:22:18.170
spacetime by putting
in those excitations,

01:22:18.170 --> 01:22:20.400
these spin-2 excitations.

01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:23.390
And if you put enough of
them, then [INAUDIBLE]

01:22:23.390 --> 01:22:26.280
deform the Minkowski spacetime
to some other curve spacetime,

01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:30.440
then you can actually
describe generically

01:22:30.440 --> 01:22:32.360
the quantum
gravitational dynamics

01:22:32.360 --> 01:22:34.350
of a general curved spacetime.

01:22:34.350 --> 01:22:35.980
So here, it's the same thing.

01:22:35.980 --> 01:22:37.780
We start with a
reach of the D-brane.

01:22:37.780 --> 01:22:40.070
Then we quantize the
excitations-- then

01:22:40.070 --> 01:22:42.410
we quantize the degrees
freedom on the D-brane.

01:22:42.410 --> 01:22:45.000
And then we find that
those degrees freedom

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.250
corresponding to the
fluctuation of the D-brane.

01:22:47.250 --> 01:22:49.530
And if you have
enough of them-- say

01:22:49.530 --> 01:22:54.030
if you have phi only depend on
p to be the same everywhere,

01:22:54.030 --> 01:22:58.170
so that's some coherent motion
for every point on this brane.

01:22:58.170 --> 01:23:02.530
So then if you build enough
[INAUDIBLE] excitations,

01:23:02.530 --> 01:23:05.780
then you can actually make
the D-brane move [INAUDIBLE]

01:23:05.780 --> 01:23:08.544
become a fully dynamic object.

01:23:08.544 --> 01:23:10.210
So that's precisely
the remarkable thing

01:23:10.210 --> 01:23:11.110
about string theory.

01:23:11.110 --> 01:23:11.385
Yes?

01:23:11.385 --> 01:23:12.260
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:23:18.969 --> 01:23:21.510
HONG LIU: No, we don't know how
to describe a dynamical brane

01:23:21.510 --> 01:23:22.301
from the beginning.

01:23:24.830 --> 01:23:26.370
No, that's how we do it.

01:23:26.370 --> 01:23:30.050
We first start
with some-- so this

01:23:30.050 --> 01:23:33.420
is called a background
dependent quantization.

01:23:33.420 --> 01:23:36.496
You start with a
specific solution.

01:23:36.496 --> 01:23:38.120
You start with a
specific configuration

01:23:38.120 --> 01:23:41.910
of the D-brane, which you
happen to be able to quantize.

01:23:41.910 --> 01:23:43.650
Then you can find
all the excitations

01:23:43.650 --> 01:23:45.910
around that particular
configuration,

01:23:45.910 --> 01:23:48.520
and then you can turn
on those excitations

01:23:48.520 --> 01:23:49.955
to move away from those points.

01:23:53.100 --> 01:23:55.190
So that's essentially
what we're doing here.

01:23:55.190 --> 01:23:55.690
OK.

01:23:55.690 --> 01:23:57.323
Let's stop.
