00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.490
HONG LIU: So let me first
just remind you briefly

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.444
what we did in last lecture--

00:00:25.444 --> 00:00:26.360
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.390
HONG LIU: --which was ages ago.

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.430
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:40.570
So we, say, quote unquote,
derived the AdS duality.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.600
And then we also
described a little bit

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.330
to the geometry of the
Anti-de Sitter spacetime.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.250
So there are two things
I want you to remember

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.280
about Anti-de Sitter spacetime.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.560
You said, there's two
ways to think about it.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.050
One is so-called
the Poincare patch,

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.680
is that, say, we have a
coordinate z or R. It depends

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.080
on your choice.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.959
So for each constant--
z is equal to 0.

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:08.520
Add to the boundary of AdS.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:27.120
So AdS have a boundary,
symmetric, yeah, so R squared.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.050
So z goes from 0 to infinity.

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:35.550
And at z equal to 0, the
overall [? prefect ?] blows up.

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.770
So the spacetime become
bigger and bigger.

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.970
So this is what we will
normally call the AdS boundary.

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.140
And then when z become bigger,
then you go to the interior.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.300
And then at each consonant z
the spacetime is [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.090
Minkowski space, say, our D
dimension in Minkowski space.

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.340
So this give you
an AdS d plus 1.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.890
OK, so this gave
you an AdS d plus 1.

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.770
And so of each z [INAUDIBLE],
it's an AdS space.

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.130
So this is so-called
the Poincare patch.

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.850
And another way
to think about AdS

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.343
is so-called the global AdS.

00:02:12.343 --> 00:02:16.130
In the global AdS, AdS
is just essentially

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.260
a [? sort ?] in the cylinder.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.000
And it is a time direction,
which we call tau.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.450
And then there's a radial
direction we call rho.

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.370
And then there's some
angular direction.

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.160
And then the boundary of
the surface-- for example,

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.860
you can write in this
global case as 1 over,

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.506
say R squared cosine squared
rho, say, minus dt squared

00:02:41.506 --> 00:02:49.230
plus d rho squared plus sine
squared rho [? d ?] omega

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.350
squared d minus 1 squared.

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.270
OK?

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.310
And this rho, and
the angular direction

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.530
is this omega d minus
1, so d tau squared.

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:02.390
OK?

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.940
And then when [? rho ?] goes
to pi over 2, then the, again,

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.410
the overall
[? prefactor ?] blows up.

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.240
So at the rho power over
2, so this is the boundary.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:18.960
So the boundary here is S3
times R. So SD minus 1 times

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.290
the time.

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.160
So it's just really a cylinder.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.730
So here, the boundary
is the R1 d minus 1,

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.010
just the Minkowski
spacetime, OK?

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.160
So this is two way I want you to
think about the Anti-de Sitter

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.990
spacetime.

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:45.980
And also, yeah-- so
before we continue,

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:47.064
do you have any questions?

00:03:47.064 --> 00:03:47.563
Yes?

00:03:47.563 --> 00:03:48.717
AUDIENCE: Just a short one.

00:03:48.717 --> 00:03:51.436
So you draw a cylinder, But
the spatial part of that metric

00:03:51.436 --> 00:03:52.882
is not precisely a cylinder.

00:03:52.882 --> 00:03:53.485
HONG LIU: Hm?

00:03:53.485 --> 00:03:55.485
AUDIENCE: I mean, the
spatial part of the metric

00:03:55.485 --> 00:03:56.480
is not precisely [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:57.813
HONG LIU: You mean the boundary?

00:03:57.813 --> 00:04:00.421
AUDIENCE: No, I mean the
sine squared rho term.

00:04:00.421 --> 00:04:01.170
That's a cylinder.

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.961
HONG LIU: Oh, I'm just
saying the topology.

00:04:02.961 --> 00:04:05.620
I'm saying the topology is
[? a sorted ?] cylinder.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.845
Yeah, the topology is
[? a sorted ?] cylinder, yeah.

00:04:12.322 --> 00:04:13.155
Any other questions?

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:17.350
OK, good.

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:26.790
So also, let me remind you
this original definition

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:28.590
of the Anti-de Sitter spacetime.

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:37.550
So Anti-de Sitter
spacetime can also

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.940
be defined as a hyperboloid.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.210
Hyperboloid in the d plus
2 dimensional Minkowski

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.710
spacetime.

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:10.780
OK, so this is the
AdS d plus 1 can also

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:15.360
be defined as
hyperboloids in the d plus

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.100
2 dimensional
Minkowski spacetime.

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:19.960
It's 2 time.

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.400
So it's a 2,d
signature with 2 time.

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:23.900
OK?

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:28.975
So now, let's talk
a little bit more

00:05:28.975 --> 00:05:32.440
about the-- the last time we
talked about geometry of AdS.

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:37.740
Now, we talk about little
bit the symmetries of AdS.

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:58.530
So let's just further
that discussion, so d

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:01.470
plus 1 dimension of AdS,
Anti-de Sitter spacetime.

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.060
So I assume all of
you are familiar of is

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.380
the concept called isometry.

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:15.575
If not, it's very
easy to understand.

00:06:15.575 --> 00:06:19.970
So isometry refers to
the class of coordinate

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:23.490
transformations, which
leaves the metric invariant.

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:24.840
OK?

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:29.230
And it's, say, if it's a
Minkowski spacetime, then

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:32.050
the isometry will the
Lorentz transformation

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:33.859
plus the translations, OK?

00:06:33.859 --> 00:06:34.900
So that's the isometries.

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:41.860
And so for this
AdS, by definition,

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:47.620
the isometry would be SO(d,2),
because this is hyperbole

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:52.560
for AdS, because the AdS
is defined as a hyperboloid

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:57.640
in this d plus 2 dimensional
Minkowski spacetime with

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:00.420
signature (2,d).

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:04.810
And this hyperboloid preserves
the Lorentz transformation.

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:10.970
So the AdS, the symmetry
will be SO(d,2).

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:14.350
Just the Lorentz symmetry
of this embedded Minkowski

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:15.000
spacetime.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.910
There's no translation
because this equation

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:19.420
breaks the translation.

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:20.695
OK?

00:07:20.695 --> 00:07:22.570
Because this equation
breaks the translation.

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:30.920
So yeah, so you can see
immediately just from there.

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:32.820
But what we will
be useful later is

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:36.490
to understand how
this is refracted

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:38.510
in the so-called Poincare patch.

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:40.020
OK?

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:42.590
So let's talk about how
this symmetry is realized

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:50.150
in the Poincare
patch, which I will

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:55.660
use these z coordinates, which
I will use these z coordinates.

00:07:55.660 --> 00:08:01.520
So first, they are translations,
which we can translate, say,

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.405
x mu to some constant.

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:09.960
So by x mu, I always
refer to using

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:11.180
these Poincare coordinates.

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:15.120
The x mu always refer
to t and the vector x.

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:15.800
OK?

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:19.370
So this is the--
so first, obvious,

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:22.800
there's a translation in
the t and x direction,

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:26.710
because that's independent
here [? in the ?] x.

00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:31.550
And then this also
Lorentz transformation

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:42.049
in the x direction, because of
the dependence on the t and x

00:08:42.049 --> 00:08:45.670
is just the Minkowski metric,
because each is [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:47.060
that Minkowski metric.

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:49.940
OK?

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:52.530
So this has d generators.

00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:56.561
So this have 1/2
d times d minus 1,

00:08:56.561 --> 00:08:59.400
because this is the
Lorentz transformation

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:02.360
in the d dimension.

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:04.800
And then, also, there's scaling.

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:19.780
So that metric, it's invariant
under such a scaling.

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:23.190
So just scale x
mu and z together.

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:25.590
And clearly, the
metric does not change.

00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:28.380
So if you scale
z and x together,

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:30.390
then all the scaling cancels.

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:32.920
No, of course, this does
not change the metric.

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:35.249
OK?

00:09:35.249 --> 00:09:37.415
So there's also scaling,
so this have one generator.

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:47.484
So the last isometry
in the-- it's

00:09:47.484 --> 00:09:49.150
called special conformal
transformation.

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:57.690
The last image of
this space, which

00:09:57.690 --> 00:10:00.192
is called the special
conformal transformation,

00:10:00.192 --> 00:10:01.650
it's a little bit
more complicated.

00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:03.530
Let me just first write it down.

00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:06.520
Then I will try to give you
some intuition about it.

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:09.050
So the [? free ?] parameter,
so the parameter for this

00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:12.640
transformation of
[? actor ?] b mu.

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:13.480
OK?

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:14.990
So I will introduce.

00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:17.020
So the transformation
is the following.

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:33.460
z go to z prime equal to-- and
the x mu goes to x mu prime.

00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:47.310
OK?

00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:51.600
So b mu is just an arbitrary
constant vector, just constant

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:52.100
vector.

00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:58.360
And so b mu squared,
so b squared is just

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:01.760
your standard b mu b mu.

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:06.325
Under the A square, it's defined
to be z square plus x mu x mu.

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:11.490
OK?

00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:13.410
So you can check
yourself, requires

00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:15.390
a little bit of effort.

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:18.790
You plug this transformation
into this expression.

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:21.600
And then you can show
that this is invariant.

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:22.520
OK?

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:27.005
So this have d
parameters, because b.

00:11:27.005 --> 00:11:28.380
So the transformation
parameters,

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:29.960
they are the d parameters.

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:33.360
So they are d parameters here.

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:33.860
OK?

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:34.693
Because of the b mu.

00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:41.840
So this transformation
can be understood

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:46.550
in a slightly easier
way, as follows.

00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:52.310
It's as you will also
do this in your p

00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:54.710
set, is that you can check.

00:11:57.490 --> 00:12:06.580
So to understand this Special
Conformal Transformation,

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:07.320
so I called SCT.

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:16.380
First, you can check the
following is isometry,

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:19.040
something we call inversion.

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:25.920
It said if z goes to z divided
by A, so A is this quantity.

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:31.460
Oh, A, I think I'm having
some notation error, myself.

00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:37.700
So I should call it
A, rather, A squared.

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:38.520
Sorry.

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:38.900
It doesn't matter.

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:40.775
I can also call it A
squared, but let me just

00:12:40.775 --> 00:12:50.760
call it A. I think that one
would be [? A2. ?] Yeah,

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:52.677
that is [? A2. ?] So,
yeah, I could just

00:12:52.677 --> 00:12:53.760
call everything A squared.

00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:56.840
But to be consistent with my
notation on the [? notes, ?]

00:12:56.840 --> 00:13:00.270
just let me call it A.

00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:03.330
So you can also check that
the following discrete

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:05.470
transformation is
also isometry, so when

00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:09.070
z equal to z divided
by A, and x mu

00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:12.730
goes to x mu divided by A. OK?

00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:14.420
You can check this is isometry.

00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:19.240
So if you plug this
into this metric,

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:21.650
you find this [? leaves ?]
the metric invariant.

00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:24.790
And this thing is
much easier to check.

00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:27.470
But as you will
do in your p set,

00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:32.010
and you can check yourself,
this discrete transformation

00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:36.590
actually is not
part of the SO(d,2).

00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:40.170
It's, in fact,
part of the O(d,2).

00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:43.280
So if you calculate its
determinant, say the Jacobean,

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:45.890
actually find the
minus 1, rather than 1.

00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:46.610
OK?

00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:50.810
So this is not a proper
Lorentz transformation.

00:13:50.810 --> 00:13:52.240
It's not a proper
transformation,

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:55.520
what we normally call the
proper transformation.

00:13:55.520 --> 00:14:03.210
But however, if
you do this twice,

00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:05.460
the minus 1 times
minus 1 equal to 1,

00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:07.679
then you get the
proper transformation.

00:14:07.679 --> 00:14:09.220
But, of course, if
you do this twice,

00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:10.437
you just go back to itself.

00:14:10.437 --> 00:14:11.020
You can check.

00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:12.940
This is inverse of itself.

00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:15.740
So this is like a
[? z2 ?] transformation.

00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:17.930
But you can do
[? a slightly ?] [? trick ?].

00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:23.100
Then you can show that
this special conformal

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:26.045
transformation is
given by an inversion.

00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:33.030
You first do an inversion, and
then you follow the [? bad ?]

00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:39.300
translation in b mu.

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:41.700
And then invert it back.

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:42.940
OK?

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:47.804
So even though you can check
that I squared is equal to 1,

00:14:47.804 --> 00:14:50.350
well, now in the middle, you
have added the translation

00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:52.750
in b mu, a constant.

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:54.900
And this is a symmetry.

00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:57.220
And, of course, the whole
thing will be a symmetry.

00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:58.928
But now, this is a
proper transformation,

00:14:58.928 --> 00:15:02.010
because I have act I twice, OK?

00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:04.630
So you can now check this
transformation is precisely--

00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:08.150
if you do this, it's precisely
just that transformation.

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:08.650
OK?

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:15.880
So if you add all
of them together,

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:19.220
d will have d minus 1 d.

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:24.030
Then you can show actually
they form this symmetry group.

00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:26.216
They form this symmetry group.

00:15:26.216 --> 00:15:38.080
So altogether, you
have d plus 1/2 d times

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:42.450
d minus 1 plus 1 plus d.

00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:45.960
Then that give you 1/2 d.

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:48.960
You can check yourself,
like 1/2 d plus 1 and d

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:53.470
plus 2, which is precisely the
number generated for that one.

00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:55.350
OK?

00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:56.660
Yes?

00:15:56.660 --> 00:16:00.090
AUDIENCE: So the total here
that dimension, the d plus 1--

00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:01.334
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:16:01.334 --> 00:16:02.930
AUDIENCE: Why like
even translation,

00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:06.900
it only has a d
dimensional invariant.

00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:09.950
HONG LIU: No, because this
depend on z, so the translation

00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:11.700
[? in ?] z is not invariant.

00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:13.083
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:16:13.083 --> 00:16:14.470
Yeah, so that would be--

00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:16.053
HONG LOU: Because
this depend on z.

00:16:16.053 --> 00:16:17.460
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:21.219
HONG LIU: So if you translate
z, this is not the isometry

00:16:21.219 --> 00:16:22.510
[? under ?] the metric changes.

00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:27.020
So only the translation
t and x is a symmetry.

00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:29.867
So that's why we only
do the translation x mu.

00:16:29.867 --> 00:16:31.200
AUDIENCE: I have some questions.

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:31.783
HONG LIU: Yes?

00:16:31.783 --> 00:16:34.185
AUDIENCE: So
conversion is isometry.

00:16:34.185 --> 00:16:34.810
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:35.393
AUDIENCE: Yes?

00:16:35.393 --> 00:16:38.630
OK, so but inversion,
there's a [? release ?] not

00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:39.820
in the SO(d,2)?

00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:40.750
HONG LIU: Yeah, right.

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:42.680
AUDIENCE: So that
means the symmetry,

00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:45.016
isometry [? work ?] [? with ?]
[INAUDIBLE] [? SO? ?]

00:16:45.016 --> 00:16:45.890
HONG LIU: Yeah, yeah.

00:16:45.890 --> 00:16:47.030
It's the standard story.

00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:51.460
You have O. You can
have an O symmetry.

00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:54.820
There's a discrete
part, which is O/ When

00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:57.950
you're transformation,
you're changing the Jacobean,

00:16:57.950 --> 00:16:59.730
whether your Jacobean
is 1 or minus 1.

00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:05.240
You just actually
[? exactly ?] the standards

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:07.854
of the transformation in
the Minkowski spacetime.

00:17:07.854 --> 00:17:09.520
In the Minkowski
spacetime, you can also

00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:10.269
can see the [? site ?]
transmissions.

00:17:10.269 --> 00:17:11.492
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:17:11.492 --> 00:17:13.119
HONG LIU: Yeah,
just the same thing,

00:17:13.119 --> 00:17:15.970
because this is just the
transformation in the Minkowski

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:17.460
spacetime of this
embedded space.

00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:20.349
AUDIENCE: So in the
[INAUDIBLE] metric,

00:17:20.349 --> 00:17:23.920
we also have a, like a--
determine [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:25.119
transformation.

00:17:25.119 --> 00:17:28.059
HONG LOU: Exactly the same as
the standard Minkowski space.

00:17:28.059 --> 00:17:28.959
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:17:28.959 --> 00:17:32.450
AUDIENCE: But discrete part
just like a [INAUDIBLE]?

00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:36.960
HONG LIU: Oh, no, it depends.

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:42.500
Yeah, in the old dimension,
yeah, in the 3 plus 1

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:44.560
dimension, just the
[? parity. ?] That's right.

00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:47.550
In the 2 plus 1 dimension,
if we invert all directions,

00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:48.310
then it's not.

00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:51.198
Right?

00:17:51.198 --> 00:17:51.698
Yes?

00:17:51.698 --> 00:17:55.086
AUDIENCE: Is there
an easy way to see

00:17:55.086 --> 00:17:58.901
the special conformal
symmetry of the system?

00:17:58.901 --> 00:17:59.442
HONG LIU: Hm?

00:17:59.442 --> 00:18:01.378
AUDIENCE: Is there
an easy way to see

00:18:01.378 --> 00:18:03.317
a symmetry from the metric?

00:18:03.317 --> 00:18:04.900
HONG LIU: Yeah, you
just plug this in.

00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:05.400
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:07.702
AUDIENCE: Well, I
mean, how do you

00:18:07.702 --> 00:18:10.280
know that there is such
symmetry, [? complicated ?]

00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:11.360
symmetries?

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:13.380
HONG LIU: No, just say
another way to understand

00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:15.910
is to do this one.

00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:19.210
So this inversion is a much
simpler transformation,

00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:22.380
which you can easily
check [? its ?] isometry.

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:26.840
And then this procedure will
guarantee this is isometry.

00:18:29.790 --> 00:18:31.320
[? because ?] each
step is isometry.

00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:39.430
Good?

00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:42.030
OK, so after talking
about the-- so

00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:45.990
that concludes our very quick
review about the geometry

00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:49.005
and properties of
Anti-de Sitter spacetime.

00:18:49.005 --> 00:18:51.187
AUDIENCE: But maybe one
more quick question.

00:18:51.187 --> 00:18:54.700
So since you said the isometry
[? bigger, ?] and so if you why

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:56.140
you only answer on the [? SO? ?]

00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:57.390
HONG LIU: It's the same thing.

00:18:57.390 --> 00:18:59.780
In Minkowski space,
we can also separate

00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:02.409
the discrete transformations and
consider the continuous part.

00:19:02.409 --> 00:19:02.950
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:04.310
HONG LIU: Yeah, so it's
just exactly the same thing.

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:04.851
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:19:04.851 --> 00:19:05.957
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:19:05.957 --> 00:19:08.040
Certainly here, we can
consider the inversion too.

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:09.950
We just here, I'm
considering the part, which

00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:11.429
connect to the [? identity ?].

00:19:11.429 --> 00:19:11.970
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:19:16.252 --> 00:19:17.460
HONG LIU: Any other question?

00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:19.745
AUDIENCE: So is it true
that in some dimensions

00:19:19.745 --> 00:19:22.165
the inversions
[INAUDIBLE] isometry?

00:19:22.165 --> 00:19:24.540
HONG LIU: I think-- no, I
think actually more dimensions.

00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:25.880
This is not.

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:27.680
In more dimension,
this is [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:28.180
Yeah, it--

00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:30.610
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:30.610 --> 00:19:34.465
HONG LIU: Inversion is always
isometry in any dimension.

00:19:34.465 --> 00:19:36.840
AUDIENCE: But it's just that
the determinant [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:38.881
HONG LIU: No, it's always
minus 1, any dimension.

00:19:38.881 --> 00:19:39.845
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:19:39.845 --> 00:19:40.470
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:19:46.224 --> 00:19:46.890
Other questions?

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:50.930
Good.

00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:54.760
So after talk about Anti-de
Sitter spacetime, now

00:19:54.760 --> 00:20:00.524
we can talk a little bit
about the string theory

00:20:00.524 --> 00:20:01.690
in Anti-de Sitter spacetime.

00:20:06.970 --> 00:20:07.470
OK?

00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:08.804
We can talk about string theory.

00:20:08.804 --> 00:20:11.303
Now, let's talk a little bit
more about a string [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:11.303 --> 00:20:12.680
the distance [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:17.370
This discussion is very
easy and essentially trivial

00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:20.154
because we know very little
about this string theory

00:20:20.154 --> 00:20:21.320
in Anti-de Sitter spacetime.

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:22.010
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:25.500
And so there's not
much to talk about.

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:29.460
But there are a few general
statements we can say.

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:33.250
So there are a few general
statements we can say.

00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:38.050
First is that both
AdS 5-- so we have

00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:43.880
said that AdS 5 is the
maximally symmetric space

00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:47.370
of negative curvature.

00:20:47.370 --> 00:20:51.700
And we all know from your
really kindergarten years,

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:58.850
that S5 is the maximal symmetric
space of positive curvature.

00:20:58.850 --> 00:21:00.440
So this combined
together is really

00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:05.030
a maximally symmetric space OK?

00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:14.390
So this AdS 5 times
S5, so AdS 5 times

00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:29.025
S5 is a homogeneous space,
homogeneous spacetime,

00:21:29.025 --> 00:21:31.650
maximally symmetric
homogeneous spacetime.

00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:40.080
So whatever string
theory in this space,

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:46.440
it's-- so the only scale in
this space is the curvature,

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:50.261
curvature radius, and which
is the same everywhere.

00:21:50.261 --> 00:21:50.760
OK?

00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:51.468
It's homogeneous.

00:21:51.468 --> 00:21:52.530
It's the same everywhere.

00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:59.520
So essentially, R, so this R
will be just a single parameter

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:02.110
to characterize the curvature
of this spacetime, so

00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:04.739
single number,
which characterize

00:22:04.739 --> 00:22:06.030
the curvature of the spacetime.

00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:07.982
So even the space
is not homogeneous,

00:22:07.982 --> 00:22:10.190
and you have to specify
which place, which curvature,

00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:10.810
et cetera.

00:22:10.810 --> 00:22:13.320
But this is the maximally
symmetric space, homogeneous.

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:19.130
So a single number captures
the curvature everywhere.

00:22:19.130 --> 00:22:26.310
So that means that in string
theory on this spacetime,

00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:36.530
it's really just characterized
by the following dimensionless

00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:40.890
parameter, so alpha prime
divided by R squared.

00:22:40.890 --> 00:22:43.330
I mean, alpha prime is
a dimensional parameter.

00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:46.480
But in the end, it's given by
the following dimensionless

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:47.220
parameter.

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:51.380
And only for any
physical process can

00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:53.210
only this
dimensionless parameter

00:22:53.210 --> 00:22:55.220
goes in, not separate
of them, because there's

00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:56.491
no other scales.

00:22:56.491 --> 00:22:58.990
i is the only scale, and alpha
prime is the only [? other ?]

00:22:58.990 --> 00:22:59.780
scale.

00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:02.780
And so for any physics, the
only dimension parameter

00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:04.600
can come in is this one.

00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:07.840
And, of course, there's
another dimensionless parameter

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:11.050
is the gs, is what we
call the string coupling.

00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:13.290
So essentially, the
series is specified

00:23:13.290 --> 00:23:15.487
by these two parameters.

00:23:15.487 --> 00:23:15.987
OK?

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:22.160
And depend on what
you want, you can also

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:25.256
construct the Newton constant.

00:23:25.256 --> 00:23:26.755
The Newton constant
can be expressed

00:23:26.755 --> 00:23:29.770
in terms of gs and 1/2 prime.

00:23:29.770 --> 00:23:31.892
So in type IIB
string, the relation,

00:23:31.892 --> 00:23:34.100
so we are talking about type
IIB string, the relation

00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:39.095
between the Newton
constant and the,

00:23:39.095 --> 00:23:41.550
say, alpha prime and the gs
is given by the following.

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:48.580
So instead of a considering
these two parameters,

00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:53.460
you can exchange gs
by Newton constant.

00:23:53.460 --> 00:24:01.160
So you can alternatively
consider, say,

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:08.390
gn to the R to the power 8, or
alpha prime to the R squared,

00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:13.185
or just characterized by these
two dimensionless numbers.

00:24:13.185 --> 00:24:17.050
After your choice, sometimes
this is more convenient,

00:24:17.050 --> 00:24:19.090
and sometimes, this
is more convenient.

00:24:19.090 --> 00:24:20.684
So if you talk
about string theory,

00:24:20.684 --> 00:24:23.100
work with the string theory
[? parse ?] [? integral, ?] et

00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:25.590
cetera, then this
is more convenient.

00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:27.420
But if you think
about the gravity,

00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:29.650
then the Newton constant
appears naturally.

00:24:29.650 --> 00:24:33.680
And then this become
more [? natural. ?] OK?

00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:41.040
So the fact of the theory
is controlled by these two

00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:42.550
dimensionless parameters.

00:24:42.550 --> 00:24:45.621
AUDIENCE: The R is a constant R?

00:24:45.621 --> 00:24:47.870
HONG LIU: Yeah, same R. It's
just the curvature radius

00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:49.340
over the spacetime.

00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:53.415
The whole spacetime, it's just
controlled by the single R.

00:24:53.415 --> 00:24:54.290
AUDIENCE: Yeah, yeah.

00:24:54.290 --> 00:25:01.840
HONG LIU: Yeah, yeah, also,
implicit in the discussion

00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:04.070
here, which is in the metric
where I wrote last time,

00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:06.380
is that the
curvature radius here

00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:09.260
is exactly the same as
the curvature radius here.

00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:11.060
And so the single
curvature radius

00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:12.366
characterizes the whole thing.

00:25:12.366 --> 00:25:12.865
OK?

00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:17.520
OK, good.

00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:21.040
So this means that whatever
quantum gravitational theory

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:23.120
or string theory
in this spacetime,

00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:27.180
you can consider q limit,
based on this 2 dimensionless

00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:28.076
parameter.

00:25:28.076 --> 00:25:30.200
So first is so-called the
classical gravity limits.

00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:41.290
So this is the limit, which
the string coupling goes to 0.

00:25:41.290 --> 00:25:45.440
So that means-- remember,
the string coupling controls

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:47.870
the [? loop ?] [? corrections ?]
over the strings.

00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:51.410
And also, essentially, it's the
fluctuation over the spacetime.

00:25:51.410 --> 00:25:53.040
And so the string coupling is 0.

00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:57.000
And also, the alpha prime
divided by R squared goes to 0.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.450
OK?

00:25:58.450 --> 00:26:01.010
So this alpha prime divided
by R squared goes to 0.

00:26:01.010 --> 00:26:04.170
So this is can be considered
as a point particle limit.

00:26:04.170 --> 00:26:06.580
Because alpha prime
essentially characterize

00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:08.430
so the [? sides ?] of a string.

00:26:08.430 --> 00:26:10.760
And when the side of the
string is much smaller

00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:13.410
than the curvature radius,
and then essentially,

00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:14.880
it's a point particle limit.

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:17.640
So this is the standard
classical gravity limit.

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:20.210
So in this region, we
have classical gravity.

00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:23.310
And you cannot tell that
those particles are strings.

00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:26.090
They're just like
ordinary particles.

00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:27.550
OK?

00:26:27.550 --> 00:26:31.170
So similarly, so g string
[? to ?] [? 0 ?] can also be

00:26:31.170 --> 00:26:33.260
considered as the limit.

00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:34.510
The Newton constant goes to 0.

00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:35.990
It's the same thing.

00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:37.046
OK?

00:26:37.046 --> 00:26:39.730
It's same thing.

00:26:39.730 --> 00:26:43.960
And so in this region,
[? you ?] get classical gravity.

00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:46.040
And more specifically,
in our case,

00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:51.770
we get to have to be super
gravity, which we briefly

00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:52.560
mentioned before.

00:26:55.390 --> 00:27:02.580
So there's a lot of the region
is called the classical string

00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:03.080
limit.

00:27:08.030 --> 00:27:10.359
In this case, the alpha
prime divided by R

00:27:10.359 --> 00:27:11.400
squared can be arbitrary.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.420
Does not have to be small.

00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:20.940
So in this region, than the
string [? G ?] [? fact ?] will

00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:21.620
be important.

00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:24.620
So you should be
able-- then that means

00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:28.990
that the spacetime
curvature radius is

00:27:28.990 --> 00:27:31.140
comparable to the string sides.

00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:33.410
Then in this case, you can
no longer treat the string

00:27:33.410 --> 00:27:35.450
as a point particle.

00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:39.110
But we still take
g string goes to 0.

00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:43.200
So that means that the
quantum fluctuation is small.

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:48.640
The spacetime quantum
fluctuation is small.

00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:51.210
So in this case, you still
have a classical theory.

00:27:51.210 --> 00:27:53.200
But it's a classical
string theory, rather than

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:55.051
a classical gravity theory.

00:27:55.051 --> 00:27:55.550
OK?

00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:05.330
Any questions regarding this?

00:28:10.175 --> 00:28:13.700
So there's another--
something else?

00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:15.766
AUDIENCE: No.

00:28:15.766 --> 00:28:17.890
HONG LIU: So there's one
feature in this spacetime.

00:28:17.890 --> 00:28:22.170
So this is altogether 10
dimensional spacetime.

00:28:22.170 --> 00:28:23.880
There's one feature
of this spacetime.

00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:29.140
It said S5 is a compact
space with a finite volume.

00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:32.990
And AdS 5 is uncompact OK?

00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:38.315
So normally, when you
have a compact space,

00:28:38.315 --> 00:28:41.250
so it's convenient--
so S5 is compact.

00:28:47.410 --> 00:28:54.630
So it's actually convenient
inside your situation

00:28:54.630 --> 00:29:15.830
to express whatever, say, 10
dimensional field in terms

00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:29.262
of-- yeah, it may be to
not express, to expand,

00:29:29.262 --> 00:29:31.510
but in 10 dimensional
fields, in terms

00:29:31.510 --> 00:29:38.570
of harmonics, [? inverse ?] 5.

00:29:38.570 --> 00:29:40.690
OK?

00:29:40.690 --> 00:29:44.820
Because there's a discrete
set of harmonics on S5,

00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:48.590
you can always expand some
10 dimensional field on it.

00:29:48.590 --> 00:29:52.840
So for example, if you
have a scalar field,

00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:59.360
so supposing if you have a
10 dimensional scalar field,

00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:01.250
say we have x mu.

00:30:01.250 --> 00:30:02.040
We have z.

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:03.920
So this is AdS5 part.

00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:08.170
And them let me call it
omega 5, which is S5 part.

00:30:08.170 --> 00:30:13.510
Then you can always, say, so you
can expand these scalar fields

00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:15.930
in terms of spherical
harmonics on S5.

00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:30.070
OK?

00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:33.620
Then what you get is you
get a tau field in AdS 5.

00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:50.420
And then this are
spherical harmonics in S5.

00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:50.920
OK?

00:30:57.850 --> 00:31:05.310
And in particular, when you do
this expansion, than the higher

00:31:05.310 --> 00:31:09.100
harmonics, they will
develop a mass, because

00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:12.160
of the curvature of the S5.

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:14.350
So the lowest mode
will be independent,

00:31:14.350 --> 00:31:16.190
say, of the
coordinate on the S5,

00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:18.624
where the higher mode will
depend on the coordinate of S5.

00:31:18.624 --> 00:31:20.290
And because of those
dependence, because

00:31:20.290 --> 00:31:23.780
of the curvature of [? base ?]
5, they will develop a mass.

00:31:23.780 --> 00:31:25.690
So the lowest mode
would be massless,

00:31:25.690 --> 00:31:29.130
then they will be followed
by tau of massive modes,

00:31:29.130 --> 00:31:32.024
controlled by the
[? size ?] of AdS 5.

00:31:32.024 --> 00:31:32.524
OK?

00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:39.120
So you can do this for any
field, any particular [? the ?]

00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:40.770
metric.

00:31:40.770 --> 00:31:43.570
So when you do
this, essentially,

00:31:43.570 --> 00:31:47.880
only the massless graviton in 5
dimension will [? mediate ?] no

00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:54.400
[? range, ?] say, gravitation
[? interactions ?] in AdS 5.

00:31:54.400 --> 00:32:01.630
So essentially, so the
gravity, so at a long distance,

00:32:01.630 --> 00:32:04.770
the gravity is
essentially 5 dimensional.

00:32:04.770 --> 00:32:05.270
OK?

00:32:16.549 --> 00:32:18.590
It's the same in 5 dimen--
because you can always

00:32:18.590 --> 00:32:20.530
reduce on S5.

00:32:20.530 --> 00:32:24.550
So there's a slightly
tricky thing here.

00:32:24.550 --> 00:32:29.390
But it's only-- it's
that the size of S5,

00:32:29.390 --> 00:32:31.270
the curvature radius
of S5 is actually

00:32:31.270 --> 00:32:33.750
the same as the curvature
radius of AdS 5.

00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:36.295
So there's not really a
hierarchy here in terms

00:32:36.295 --> 00:32:37.295
of the curvature radius.

00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:42.270
But there's still an
important difference.

00:32:42.270 --> 00:32:43.530
These have infinite volume.

00:32:43.530 --> 00:32:44.570
These only have a finite volume.

00:32:44.570 --> 00:32:45.445
So these are compact.

00:32:45.445 --> 00:32:46.510
These are uncompact.

00:32:46.510 --> 00:32:48.590
OK?

00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:51.097
AUDIENCE: But why the
gravity [? doesn't-- ?]

00:32:51.097 --> 00:32:51.638
HONG LIU: Hm?

00:32:51.638 --> 00:32:53.626
AUDIENCE: But why
the gravity doesn't

00:32:53.626 --> 00:32:56.120
say this string [? S5? ?]

00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:59.890
HONG LIU: No, it-- [INAUDIBLE]
[? this thing ?] radius--

00:32:59.890 --> 00:33:02.829
this [? thing ?] S5.

00:33:02.829 --> 00:33:04.620
But just as I said,
this is a compact part.

00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:06.160
You can always do a reduction.

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:09.352
And then the higher graviton
mode will develop a mass.

00:33:09.352 --> 00:33:10.530
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:33:10.530 --> 00:33:13.237
HONG LIU: Yeah, we
develop a mass, yeah,

00:33:13.237 --> 00:33:14.820
even though that
mass is not very big.

00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:15.746
Yes?

00:33:15.746 --> 00:33:21.270
AUDIENCE: So if we applied
this to the real world, then

00:33:21.270 --> 00:33:23.410
what would estimate for R?

00:33:23.410 --> 00:33:24.076
HONG LIU: Sorry?

00:33:24.076 --> 00:33:25.950
AUDIENCE: What's the
estimate of this radius,

00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:30.000
this curvature for if
it's should be comparables

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.390
are of the original worlds?

00:33:31.390 --> 00:33:32.930
HONG LIU: [INAUDIBLE]
the size of the universe.

00:33:32.930 --> 00:33:34.400
AUDIENCE: But then
doesn't it mean

00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:41.988
that we only should worry about
the mass of this compact mode?

00:33:41.988 --> 00:33:42.613
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:33:42.613 --> 00:33:44.706
AUDIENCE: Only on distances
much longer than ours?

00:33:44.706 --> 00:33:45.580
HONG LIU: Yeah, yeah.

00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:48.220
I mean, just saying,
at very large distance,

00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:49.500
essentially is 5 dimensions.

00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:52.390
But it's still-- you can
talk about the distance

00:33:52.390 --> 00:33:53.910
scale, et cetera.

00:33:53.910 --> 00:33:55.900
But here, R is the only scale.

00:33:55.900 --> 00:33:57.740
It doesn't matter how
large is R. Everything

00:33:57.740 --> 00:34:00.428
matches against R. R
provides your units.

00:34:00.428 --> 00:34:02.386
AUDIENCE: Yes, but when
we talk about distances

00:34:02.386 --> 00:34:03.774
shorter than R then--

00:34:03.774 --> 00:34:05.940
HONG LIU: Yeah, if you talk
about a distance shorter

00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:07.870
than R, it doesn't matter.

00:34:07.870 --> 00:34:09.400
It's like a 10 dimensional.

00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:11.179
It's like a 10
dimension [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:11.179 --> 00:34:16.260
But AdS is uncompact, you can
go as much distance as you want.

00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:20.100
I'm just saying, the
story is slightly tricky

00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:22.730
because they have the
same curvature radius.

00:34:22.730 --> 00:34:25.219
But I'm trying to
describe it in the spirit.

00:34:25.219 --> 00:34:28.130
And also, mathematically,
you can always,

00:34:28.130 --> 00:34:30.190
because S5 is uncompact,
you can always

00:34:30.190 --> 00:34:31.940
do dimensional reduction on it.

00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:33.929
And this provides
a convenient way

00:34:33.929 --> 00:34:37.151
to organize fields, in terms
of 5 dimensional fields.

00:34:37.151 --> 00:34:37.692
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:34:40.290 --> 00:34:41.060
HONG LIU: OK.

00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:44.210
So one thing we will
often use is, indeed,

00:34:44.210 --> 00:34:47.250
just consider the dimensional
reduction of the gravity

00:34:47.250 --> 00:34:49.179
to 5 dimension.

00:34:49.179 --> 00:34:51.460
So if you have, say,
say suppose this is

00:34:51.460 --> 00:34:53.889
Einstein-Hilbert action in 10d.

00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:59.600
So this is AdS 5 part.

00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:01.770
This is the S5 part.

00:35:01.770 --> 00:35:07.580
So you have some 10
dimensional, so curvature.

00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:10.910
So R is a [? rich ?]
scalar in 10d.

00:35:10.910 --> 00:35:13.530
OK.

00:35:13.530 --> 00:35:16.400
Now, suppose the metric,
suppose this considered

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:22.520
the lowest mode for the metric,
which have low S5 dependence.

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:26.620
And then you can just reduce
this to a 5 dimensional theory.

00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:30.050
Gravity, so the
volume of the S5 part,

00:35:30.050 --> 00:35:43.530
we are just
[? factorize. ?] Then

00:35:43.530 --> 00:35:45.230
you have a 5 dimensional scalar.

00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:45.970
OK?

00:35:45.970 --> 00:35:49.765
And this b5 is just
the volume of S5.

00:35:49.765 --> 00:35:50.760
OK?

00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:51.260
5.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:58.460
And now, we can absorb this b5
into downstairs, then define

00:35:58.460 --> 00:36:00.525
or you factor your 5
dimension Newton constant.

00:36:05.350 --> 00:36:07.570
5 [INAUDIBLE] Newton
constant, which

00:36:07.570 --> 00:36:11.360
we are call G5, which is
defined to be GN divided

00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:15.390
by the volume of the 5 sphere.

00:36:15.390 --> 00:36:16.550
OK?

00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:23.425
And the volume of the 5 sphere
is, essentially, just pi q.

00:36:23.425 --> 00:36:23.925
OK?

00:36:23.925 --> 00:36:28.330
And then, of course, there's
R to the power [? of 5th. ?]

00:36:28.330 --> 00:36:30.260
So this is the quantity
we will often use.

00:36:33.608 --> 00:36:34.108
OK?

00:36:42.790 --> 00:36:47.060
So of the dimensional
reduction, in the end,

00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:52.910
you get the action [? we will ?]
have the form 14 pi G5,

00:36:52.910 --> 00:37:00.040
so 5 dimensional Newton
constant, say, [? d5x ?],

00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:02.180
just AdS part.

00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:05.690
And then you have the
gravity part of the action.

00:37:05.690 --> 00:37:09.310
And then you plus many,
many matter fields.

00:37:09.310 --> 00:37:13.980
So this is, the essentially will
be the structure of your action

00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:16.080
when you do the
dimensional reduction.

00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:17.050
OK?

00:37:17.050 --> 00:37:21.420
AUDIENCE: Shall we have
matter fields in the S5?

00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:24.690
HONG LIU: No, you
reduce everything on S5.

00:37:24.690 --> 00:37:28.700
And once you have done that,
then S5 will disappear.

00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:30.990
AUDIENCE: But when
we do, say, the R

00:37:30.990 --> 00:37:34.600
is [? always ?] a constant, so
we can do the integral easily

00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:35.846
in S5.

00:37:35.846 --> 00:37:38.620
But if we don't have
some mass [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:43.760
HONG LIU: Yeah, so
no, it doesn't matter.

00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:47.320
So you can take-- this is a
standard story for [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:48.710
reduct-- a standard story.

00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:55.680
When you expand around in this,
so this will go into here.

00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:58.940
Then the only dependence
on the S5 part

00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:00.350
will depend on those things.

00:38:00.350 --> 00:38:00.650
AUDIENCE: Uh-huh.

00:38:00.650 --> 00:38:02.190
HONG LIU: Then you just
can't integrate those things.

00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:02.500
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:04.200
HONG LIU: You can
always integrate them.

00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:05.740
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:11.151
HONG LIU: And they just give you
some integrals, some numbers.

00:38:11.151 --> 00:38:12.650
It would just give
you some numbers.

00:38:12.650 --> 00:38:14.608
And in the end, you can
always write the action

00:38:14.608 --> 00:38:17.450
in terms of 5
dimensional action.

00:38:17.450 --> 00:38:20.840
AUDIENCE: But that solution
is a classical solution

00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:22.115
for the [INAUDIBLE] equation.

00:38:22.115 --> 00:38:22.990
HONG LIU: No, no, no.

00:38:22.990 --> 00:38:24.480
This is not a
classical solution.

00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:26.092
I'm just doing an expansion.

00:38:26.092 --> 00:38:27.800
It's just like doing
a Fornier transform.

00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:28.508
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:38:28.508 --> 00:38:30.690
HONG LIU: This is expand
in terms-- in some basis.

00:38:30.690 --> 00:38:32.700
No, have not done anything.

00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:35.340
This just a
mathematical rewriting,

00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:36.212
AUDIENCE: Mm-hm, OK.

00:38:36.212 --> 00:38:36.795
HONG LIU: Yes?

00:38:36.795 --> 00:38:40.190
AUDIENCE: But I think in terms
of expression for G Newton

00:38:40.190 --> 00:38:45.540
into the affected-- don't we
have that this G5 is like G

00:38:45.540 --> 00:38:48.210
squared alpha for the
[INAUDIBLE] [? divided by ?]

00:38:48.210 --> 00:38:50.830
[? R to the 5th y ?] can put
[? a use it ?] to this alpha R

00:38:50.830 --> 00:38:52.510
squared combination?

00:38:52.510 --> 00:38:55.458
HONG LIU: Sorry--

00:38:55.458 --> 00:39:00.190
AUDIENCE: Express G5 in
terms of GS and alpha prime.

00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:00.970
HONG LIU: Yeah?

00:39:00.970 --> 00:39:02.750
AUDIENCE: And [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:02.750 --> 00:39:07.787
Why don't it look like only
combinations of R prime over R

00:39:07.787 --> 00:39:10.650
squared and GS?

00:39:10.650 --> 00:39:13.320
HONG LIU: Sorry, I don't
understand what you're asking.

00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:15.800
No, G5 is a
dimensional parameter.

00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:18.930
5 dimension Newton
constant had dimensions 3.

00:39:18.930 --> 00:39:22.150
So whatever dimension here,
some [? other ?] dimension

00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:23.910
there would be
compensated by R5.

00:39:23.910 --> 00:39:27.130
But you always have
3 dimension left.

00:39:27.130 --> 00:39:32.062
So this is a dimension
3 number, yeah.

00:39:32.062 --> 00:39:32.895
Any other questions?

00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:38.370
Good.

00:39:38.370 --> 00:39:41.060
OK, so then this
concludes our discussion

00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:43.860
about string theory
in AdS 5 times S5.

00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:47.270
As I said, there's not
much to talk about it.

00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:51.080
And so now, let's look
at the other object,

00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:52.830
which is the N equal
to 4 super-Yang-Mills

00:39:52.830 --> 00:39:59.360
theory, which is the other
side of the equation,

00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:01.536
of the duality equation.

00:40:01.536 --> 00:40:03.230
OK?

00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:06.734
So in this case, we have
a lot to talk about it.

00:40:06.734 --> 00:40:08.650
We, in principle, have
a lot to talk about it,

00:40:08.650 --> 00:40:10.500
but we won't have time.

00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:13.940
So we will also not
talk much about it.

00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:19.810
So we are only mentioning
a few essential things, OK?

00:40:19.810 --> 00:40:23.160
So the field content, say, of
a N equal to 4 super-Yang-Mills

00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:29.630
theory, which we
already learned,

00:40:29.630 --> 00:40:33.580
which we already learned
from the [INAUDIBLE] theory

00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:38.360
on the D3-brane is that you
should have a gauge field.

00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:40.656
And then you have a 6 scalar
field, because 1 into 6

00:40:40.656 --> 00:40:42.280
transverse direction
over the D3-brane.

00:40:47.010 --> 00:40:49.780
OK, you have 6 scalar fields.

00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:54.190
And then when you include
the super symmetric center,

00:40:54.190 --> 00:40:56.830
in the super string,
then they actually also

00:40:56.830 --> 00:41:01.580
the massless of fermions.

00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:03.890
So this is 3 plus 1 dimension.

00:41:03.890 --> 00:41:04.435
OK?

00:41:04.435 --> 00:41:07.650
So this is 3 plus 1 dimension.

00:41:07.650 --> 00:41:13.200
So in 3 plus 1 dimension, you
can represent the fermions

00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:15.920
conveniently by two components,
for example, two component Weyl

00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:18.020
fermions.

00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:21.650
They it turns out there
are 4 such Weyl fermions.

00:41:21.650 --> 00:41:25.070
So A will go to 1 to 4.

00:41:25.070 --> 00:41:27.930
So alpha is a spinor indices.

00:41:27.930 --> 00:41:30.010
And A just neighbor
different spinors.

00:41:30.010 --> 00:41:32.890
So altogether, you
have four spinors.

00:41:32.890 --> 00:41:34.940
OK?

00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:37.440
And so this is, essentially,
the field content

00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:39.400
of the N equal to 4
super-Yang-Mills theory.

00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:42.140
So we would not worry
about the fermions.

00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:46.346
So but I'm just mention
here for completeness.

00:41:46.346 --> 00:41:50.625
So if you have a
U(N) gauge theory,

00:41:50.625 --> 00:41:53.200
if you have a U(N)
guage theory, say,

00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:57.570
for the N D3-brane,
then all this,

00:41:57.570 --> 00:42:06.615
all this field is in the
of the [INAUDIBLE] of U(N).

00:42:06.615 --> 00:42:11.850
In other words, each of
them is an N by N matrix,

00:42:11.850 --> 00:42:15.021
is N by N Hermitian matrix.

00:42:15.021 --> 00:42:15.520
OK?

00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:21.880
So each of them
can be represented

00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:23.110
by Hermitian matrices.

00:42:26.110 --> 00:42:36.970
So altogether, yeah, yeah--
so let me not write it.

00:42:36.970 --> 00:42:38.540
Let me just say it in words.

00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:41.250
So altogether, you
have 8 [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:41.250 --> 00:42:43.640
You have 8 bosonic
degrees of freedom.

00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:46.390
Because for the
photon, you have 2.

00:42:46.390 --> 00:42:49.380
For photon, you have 2
[INAUDIBLE] degrees of freedom.

00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:51.420
And here, 6 scalar field,
you have 8 [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:52.696
degrees of freedom.

00:42:52.696 --> 00:42:54.070
And for the fermion,
you can also

00:42:54.070 --> 00:42:58.375
count that the 4 Weyl spinors
actually have 8 [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:58.375 --> 00:43:01.310
degrees of freedom.

00:43:01.310 --> 00:43:04.720
So altogether, you
have 8 N square.

00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:07.440
Each of them is
an N by N matrix.

00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:10.570
So you have 8 N squared, say,
[INAUDIBLE] bosonic degrees

00:43:10.570 --> 00:43:13.779
of freedom, and eight 8 N
squared for mionic [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:13.779 --> 00:43:14.570
degrees of freedom.

00:43:14.570 --> 00:43:17.992
OK, for the--

00:43:17.992 --> 00:43:21.315
AUDIENCE: Why would
we have 8 fermions?

00:43:21.315 --> 00:43:21.856
HONG LIU: Hm?

00:43:21.856 --> 00:43:23.125
AUDIENCE: We have 8 fermions?

00:43:23.125 --> 00:43:24.500
HONG LIU: No, we
have 4 fermions,

00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:26.150
but each fermion have
some spinor component.

00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:27.025
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK, OK.

00:43:27.025 --> 00:43:27.811
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:43:27.811 --> 00:43:29.680
AUDIENCE: Where did
the number come from?

00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:30.346
HONG LIU: Sorry?

00:43:30.346 --> 00:43:32.906
AUDIENCE: Where did 4 fermions?

00:43:32.906 --> 00:43:34.530
HONG LIU: That come
from a calculation.

00:43:34.530 --> 00:43:37.230
This I cannot explain here.

00:43:37.230 --> 00:43:38.800
This, I can only
quote this fact.

00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:42.290
It's just that if you work out
the theory on the D3-brane,

00:43:42.290 --> 00:43:47.650
then [INAUDIBLE] there's
4 Weyl fermions, yeah,

00:43:47.650 --> 00:43:50.120
which we did not go through
that, because we did not

00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:51.840
do super string.

00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:52.830
Yeah.

00:43:52.830 --> 00:43:57.285
AUDIENCE: Should this come
from the fact that it's where

00:43:57.285 --> 00:43:58.270
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:43:58.270 --> 00:43:58.770
Symmetry?

00:43:58.770 --> 00:44:01.080
HONG LIU: Yeah, it's come
from the super symmetry.

00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:05.250
Yeah, come form the string
theory, super string theory.

00:44:05.250 --> 00:44:09.060
So in our discussion, we
only discussed bosonic part.

00:44:09.060 --> 00:44:14.160
We never had time to discuss
for mionic part, et cetera.

00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:18.240
So let me now mention one
important point, which

00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:20.470
I think is-- I hope
is self-obvious,

00:44:20.470 --> 00:44:23.570
self-evident to you.

00:44:23.570 --> 00:44:31.160
It's that this U(N)-- actually,
there's a U(1) which decouples,

00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:33.840
which U(1) decouples,
just actually,

00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:38.140
let me just write down the
Yang-Mills theory first.

00:44:38.140 --> 00:44:40.360
So let me write down the
Yang-Mills theory first.

00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:44.050
So you can write down the
Yang-Mills theory, which we are

00:44:44.050 --> 00:44:46.090
actually wrote it down before.

00:44:46.090 --> 00:44:48.220
Let me only write
down the bosonic part.

00:44:51.930 --> 00:44:57.310
So essentially, just given
by Yang-Mills coupling trace.

00:45:03.890 --> 00:45:06.180
And this is a covariant
derivative acting

00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:08.970
on the scalar, standard
covariant derivatives.

00:45:13.090 --> 00:45:15.950
And the I and the
j are all summed.

00:45:15.950 --> 00:45:18.430
OK?

00:45:18.430 --> 00:45:20.280
So I and the j are all summed.

00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:23.430
So this is the Lagrangian,
then plus the fermionic part.

00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:26.241
So this is the bosonic part,
then plus the fermionic part.

00:45:26.241 --> 00:45:26.740
OK?

00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:34.420
Yes?

00:45:34.420 --> 00:45:36.530
AUDIENCE: Are fermions
coupled through 5 fields?

00:45:36.530 --> 00:45:38.030
HONG LIU: Yeah,
they're all coupled.

00:45:41.090 --> 00:45:42.118
They're all coupled.

00:45:42.118 --> 00:45:43.950
AUDIENCE: How do they couple?

00:45:43.950 --> 00:45:45.616
HONG LIU: Standard
[INAUDIBLE] coupling.

00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:57.180
Yeah, so the key, so they couple
through a particular coupling.

00:45:57.180 --> 00:46:00.820
The hosting, it just can show
to have a single coupling.

00:46:00.820 --> 00:46:02.592
In principle, if you
have so many fields,

00:46:02.592 --> 00:46:04.800
you can have many, many
different possible couplings.

00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:07.389
You can have one
coupling between them,

00:46:07.389 --> 00:46:08.930
one coupling between
them, et cetera.

00:46:08.930 --> 00:46:11.530
You can have different
components, but

00:46:11.530 --> 00:46:13.300
and self-couplings, et cetera.

00:46:13.300 --> 00:46:15.820
And under the key of N
equal to 4 super-Yang-Mills

00:46:15.820 --> 00:46:22.120
theory is that every coupling,
they equal up to some constant,

00:46:22.120 --> 00:46:25.200
up to some constant
factors, which is precisely

00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:26.780
give you the supersymmetry.

00:46:26.780 --> 00:46:32.510
Anyway, so I think
it's obvious to you

00:46:32.510 --> 00:46:38.910
that you have a U(N)
Yang-Mills theory that the U(1)

00:46:38.910 --> 00:46:39.695
part decouples.

00:46:44.930 --> 00:46:45.430
OK?

00:46:48.730 --> 00:46:49.855
OK, you unplug the couples.

00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:56.200
So U(N), you can
always decompose it

00:46:56.200 --> 00:47:02.640
into SU(N) times U(1).

00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:05.880
Under the U(1)
part, [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:10.280
So each A, each field
is N by N matrix.

00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:13.010
And the U(1) part
is the part which

00:47:13.010 --> 00:47:15.720
is proportional to
the identity matrix.

00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:19.680
And the SU(N) part is
the part which given

00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:23.240
by N by N trace this matrix.

00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:26.800
And so the U(1) part is
proportional to the identity

00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:28.740
matrix.

00:47:28.740 --> 00:47:31.120
So but you can immediately
see from here, anything which

00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:32.890
is proportional to
the identity matrix

00:47:32.890 --> 00:47:35.110
all the commentators
will vanish.

00:47:35.110 --> 00:47:35.930
OK?

00:47:35.930 --> 00:47:38.840
So essentially, U(1)
part is a free theory.

00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:40.090
So U(1) part is a free theory.

00:47:51.264 --> 00:47:52.680
Yeah, if this is
not clear to you,

00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:55.820
you can easily convince
yourself afterwards.

00:48:02.240 --> 00:48:05.610
And this is also
where-- this is also

00:48:05.610 --> 00:48:08.720
physically clear from
the point of view,

00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:12.305
thinking that this is
coming from the D-branes.

00:48:12.305 --> 00:48:14.430
Coming from the D-brane,
you have, essentially, you

00:48:14.430 --> 00:48:17.140
have N D-brane together.

00:48:17.140 --> 00:48:20.510
And this Yang-Mills
theory essentially

00:48:20.510 --> 00:48:23.010
describes the low energy
dynamics of D-branes, brains,

00:48:23.010 --> 00:48:25.780
so how all these N D-branes
interact with each other.

00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:27.780
But no matter know how
they [? co-communicate ?]

00:48:27.780 --> 00:48:30.405
[? interact ?] with each other,
there's always a center of mass

00:48:30.405 --> 00:48:31.640
motion.

00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:34.970
Does not depend on their
internal structure.

00:48:34.970 --> 00:48:38.450
And that central mass motion
essentially is just this U(1).

00:48:38.450 --> 00:48:40.610
And the central mass
motion always decouple.

00:48:40.610 --> 00:48:41.490
OK?

00:48:41.490 --> 00:48:42.992
So U(1) decouples.

00:48:42.992 --> 00:48:44.450
And you can do the
check from here.

00:48:44.450 --> 00:48:45.320
A U(1) decouples.

00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:45.820
OK?

00:48:45.820 --> 00:48:47.055
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:48:47.055 --> 00:48:47.680
HONG LIU: Good.

00:48:53.390 --> 00:48:57.950
So now let me-- so the
interacting part is just SU(N).

00:48:57.950 --> 00:48:59.300
OK?

00:48:59.300 --> 00:49:02.700
The interacting
part is just SU(N).

00:49:02.700 --> 00:49:04.430
So now, let me say a
few words regarding

00:49:04.430 --> 00:49:05.770
the properties of the theory.

00:49:14.610 --> 00:49:18.140
So first, it's that this theory
has N equal to 4 supersymmetry.

00:49:28.510 --> 00:49:29.640
OK?

00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:31.430
So this is another
important remark.

00:49:31.430 --> 00:49:35.990
This is just explain the
name, just explains the name.

00:49:38.660 --> 00:49:42.950
So in supersymmetric
theories, so you

00:49:42.950 --> 00:49:45.730
have a transformation between
boson and the fermion.

00:49:45.730 --> 00:49:46.360
OK?

00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:49.700
You have some-- the theory is
invariant on the transformation

00:49:49.700 --> 00:49:51.840
between boson and fermion.

00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:54.090
So on the [? side of ?]
transformation,

00:49:54.090 --> 00:49:57.300
the [? conserved ?] charge, so
for [INAUDIBLE] transformation,

00:49:57.300 --> 00:49:59.570
then you have loss of charge.

00:49:59.570 --> 00:50:01.835
[? For ?] [? such ?] [? as ?]
transformation and loss

00:50:01.835 --> 00:50:05.690
of charge can be
described by a spinor.

00:50:05.690 --> 00:50:06.190
OK?

00:50:09.030 --> 00:50:12.140
So normally, we say N
equal to 1 supersymmetry

00:50:12.140 --> 00:50:15.030
if the super charge is
given by a single Weyl

00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:16.800
spinor in 4 dimension.

00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:20.530
So N equal to 4 means
that the total number

00:50:20.530 --> 00:50:24.470
of such [? conserved ?] charge
is actually given by the 4 Weyl

00:50:24.470 --> 00:50:25.910
spinors in the 4 dimension.

00:50:25.910 --> 00:50:27.780
So it doesn't
matter, so these have

00:50:27.780 --> 00:50:30.140
a number of supersymmetries.

00:50:30.140 --> 00:50:31.570
OK?

00:50:31.570 --> 00:50:34.300
And also, if you know a
little bit of supersymmetry,

00:50:34.300 --> 00:50:36.490
then this is actually
the maximally allowed,

00:50:36.490 --> 00:50:38.320
the supersymmetry
in 4 dimensions,

00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:40.640
for [INAUDIBLE] field theory.

00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:43.970
So this is actually maximum
allowed supersymmetry.

00:50:43.970 --> 00:50:45.590
But this will not
be important for us.

00:50:45.590 --> 00:50:46.090
OK?

00:50:49.090 --> 00:50:50.030
But this will be.

00:50:50.030 --> 00:50:52.345
But the next point will
be very important for us.

00:50:56.010 --> 00:51:03.680
It's that because of this
theory is so symmetric,

00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:08.730
so G Yang-Mills coupling, its
dimensionless, classically.

00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:18.760
OK?

00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:22.220
Because this is a 4 dimension,
the Yang-Mills coupling

00:51:22.220 --> 00:51:25.360
is dimensionless, classically.

00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:29.110
And the same thing with
our own QCD, our own QCD

00:51:29.110 --> 00:51:32.110
coupling this
dimensionless, classically.

00:51:32.110 --> 00:51:36.260
But then quantum mechanically,
then the coupling actually

00:51:36.260 --> 00:51:39.010
changes with the scale, OK,
because over the quantum

00:51:39.010 --> 00:51:40.280
corrections, et cetera.

00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:43.430
So generic coupling
changes with scale.

00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:45.610
But N equal to 4
super-Yang-Mills theory

00:51:45.610 --> 00:51:47.049
is special.

00:51:47.049 --> 00:51:48.840
But this actually, this
Yang-Mills coupling

00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:52.322
does not change with the scale,
even at the quantum level.

00:51:52.322 --> 00:51:53.780
So the quantum
level, this remains,

00:51:53.780 --> 00:51:54.863
so dimensionless coupling.

00:51:57.530 --> 00:52:03.090
So using the technical
term, for those of you who

00:52:03.090 --> 00:52:06.180
have studied the QC
Yang-Mills theory,

00:52:06.180 --> 00:52:10.470
is that the beta function at
the quantum mechanical level,

00:52:10.470 --> 00:52:17.450
the beta function
for G Yang-Mills

00:52:17.450 --> 00:52:29.280
is actually 0, which means
you can really treat this G

00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:45.090
Yang-Mills as a parameter, as
a dimensionless parameter, even

00:52:45.090 --> 00:52:46.090
quantum mechanically.

00:52:46.090 --> 00:52:46.590
OK?

00:52:51.050 --> 00:52:54.180
So this is a genuine parameter.

00:52:54.180 --> 00:52:58.340
In contrasting our QCD,
there's no such parameter.

00:52:58.340 --> 00:52:58.840
OK?

00:52:58.840 --> 00:53:01.225
In QCD, we only have a scale.

00:53:01.225 --> 00:53:02.100
There's no parameter.

00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:06.180
Good?

00:53:06.180 --> 00:53:08.996
So any questions
regarding these?

00:53:08.996 --> 00:53:10.454
AUDIENCE: But you
said you wouldn't

00:53:10.454 --> 00:53:14.810
know the coupling [INAUDIBLE]
coupling because of

00:53:14.810 --> 00:53:16.760
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:18.420
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:53:18.420 --> 00:53:21.592
AUDIENCE: That means
this is not [INAUDIBLE]?

00:53:21.592 --> 00:53:22.550
HONG LIU: No, it's not.

00:53:22.550 --> 00:53:23.909
No, in the--

00:53:23.909 --> 00:53:25.200
AUDIENCE: It's not [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:28.949
HONG LIU: In QCD, the Yang-Mills
coupling is not the parameter.

00:53:28.949 --> 00:53:30.490
It's not the
dimensionless parameter.

00:53:30.490 --> 00:53:31.031
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:53:31.031 --> 00:53:32.693
HONG LIU: It translates
into a scale.

00:53:32.693 --> 00:53:33.276
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:53:33.276 --> 00:53:34.780
HONG LIU: It translates
into a scale.

00:53:34.780 --> 00:53:35.363
AUDIENCE: So--

00:53:35.363 --> 00:53:38.360
HONG LIU: It translates
into a mass scale.

00:53:38.360 --> 00:53:41.755
AUDIENCE: Yes, but can we
find a massless parameter

00:53:41.755 --> 00:53:44.050
in [INAUDIBLE] like this?

00:53:44.050 --> 00:53:47.292
HONG LIU: No, because the beta
function is nonzero there.

00:53:47.292 --> 00:53:50.130
AUDIENCE: Ah.

00:53:50.130 --> 00:53:52.960
HONG LIU: Yeah, yeah because the
beta function is nonzero there.

00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:53.960
OK?

00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:58.280
And also because of this,
the beta function is 0.

00:53:58.280 --> 00:54:03.768
This theory is actually
conformally invariant,

00:54:12.740 --> 00:54:14.460
theory is actually
conformally invariant.

00:54:14.460 --> 00:54:15.540
OK?

00:54:15.540 --> 00:54:18.250
So which we'll normally call,
say, it's a conformal field

00:54:18.250 --> 00:54:19.980
theory, because it's a CFT.

00:54:26.210 --> 00:54:32.390
So one way to understand this
is because of the beta function

00:54:32.390 --> 00:54:36.210
is 0, essentially, the
theory does not have a scale.

00:54:36.210 --> 00:54:38.670
So theory classical scale,
invariant quantum mechanically

00:54:38.670 --> 00:54:40.262
remains scale invariant.

00:54:40.262 --> 00:54:41.970
And then you can show
that there actually

00:54:41.970 --> 00:54:45.840
is a little bit more generous
conformally invariant.

00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:49.860
So let me say a little
bit about the-- are people

00:54:49.860 --> 00:54:53.190
familiar with the concept of
the conformally invariant,

00:54:53.190 --> 00:54:54.020
or conformal?

00:54:54.020 --> 00:54:54.899
AUDIENCE: No.

00:54:54.899 --> 00:54:55.440
HONG LIU: No?

00:54:55.440 --> 00:54:55.985
OK.

00:54:55.985 --> 00:54:59.310
Yeah, so let me say a few
words about the conformal.

00:54:59.310 --> 00:55:01.810
So conformally invariant
means that the theory

00:55:01.810 --> 00:55:03.920
were under the conformal
transformations.

00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:04.860
OK?

00:55:04.860 --> 00:55:07.318
So let me say a few words on
the conformal transformations.

00:55:11.830 --> 00:55:16.930
So conformal transformations
are the following.

00:55:16.930 --> 00:55:21.680
Say, suppose your
spacetime metric

00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:25.430
is given by some G mu mu.

00:55:25.430 --> 00:55:28.100
So the conformal
transformations are those

00:55:28.100 --> 00:55:30.600
coordinate transformations.

00:55:30.600 --> 00:55:31.100
OK?

00:55:31.100 --> 00:55:34.620
You go from x to x prime.

00:55:34.620 --> 00:55:39.010
So that under such a
transformation, your metric,

00:55:39.010 --> 00:55:43.850
the transformed metric is
related to the original one

00:55:43.850 --> 00:55:47.610
only by an overall scale factor.

00:55:47.610 --> 00:55:48.110
OK?

00:55:55.150 --> 00:55:57.990
So if lambda is
equal to 1, then this

00:55:57.990 --> 00:56:01.330
is what we called
earlier isometry, which

00:56:01.330 --> 00:56:04.810
leave the metric invariant,
will be isometry.

00:56:04.810 --> 00:56:07.440
And if you leave
the metric invariant

00:56:07.440 --> 00:56:09.980
after your overall
scale factor, then this

00:56:09.980 --> 00:56:12.330
is called the conformal
transformation.

00:56:12.330 --> 00:56:14.690
OK?

00:56:14.690 --> 00:56:19.990
And for the Minkowski spacetime,
for Minkowski spacetime,

00:56:19.990 --> 00:56:22.930
actually, I can just
even use this thing here.

00:56:22.930 --> 00:56:29.499
Yeah, maybe let me--
yeah, let me erase here.

00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:42.645
So for Minkowski
spacetime, say if the G mu

00:56:42.645 --> 00:56:46.190
mu is equal to [INAUDIBLE]
mu mu-- suppose this

00:56:46.190 --> 00:56:54.390
is a d dimensional
Minkowski spacetime-- OK?

00:56:54.390 --> 00:56:57.940
Then you can show--
you can just work

00:56:57.940 --> 00:57:00.560
how to solve this
equation, work out

00:57:00.560 --> 00:57:01.976
all possible such
transformations.

00:57:01.976 --> 00:57:02.476
OK?

00:57:06.240 --> 00:57:11.260
And you can show that
conformal transformations

00:57:11.260 --> 00:57:12.260
are the following.

00:57:12.260 --> 00:57:15.041
First, they are the
standard isometry,

00:57:15.041 --> 00:57:17.290
which is the translation,
because the translation does

00:57:17.290 --> 00:57:20.230
not give you lambda 1.

00:57:20.230 --> 00:57:23.590
And then you have a
Lorentz transformation,

00:57:23.590 --> 00:57:26.260
which also give you lambda 1.

00:57:26.260 --> 00:57:27.680
OK?

00:57:27.680 --> 00:57:29.210
And they you can have a scaling.

00:57:29.210 --> 00:57:33.326
Of course, if you
scale your coordinate

00:57:33.326 --> 00:57:38.100
with some factor,
then, of course,

00:57:38.100 --> 00:57:42.214
the metric will only
change by overall factor.

00:57:42.214 --> 00:57:43.255
So this is a translation.

00:57:47.140 --> 00:57:51.000
So this is s Lorentz symmetry.

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:54.790
And this is scaling.

00:57:54.790 --> 00:57:56.329
And then we also
have something what

00:57:56.329 --> 00:57:58.120
we call a special
conformal transformation.

00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:20.390
So this is for-- OK?

00:58:20.390 --> 00:58:22.620
And the b, again, is
some constant parameter.

00:58:22.620 --> 00:58:25.160
OK?

00:58:25.160 --> 00:58:31.660
And also for the
discrete transformation,

00:58:31.660 --> 00:58:32.910
also, you can have a discrete.

00:58:37.530 --> 00:58:41.075
Also you can have a discrete
transformations inversion.

00:58:45.042 --> 00:58:49.946
You [? said ?] x prime mu equal
to x mu divided by x squared.

00:58:49.946 --> 00:58:50.446
OK?

00:58:54.430 --> 00:58:58.530
So these are all
the transformations.

00:58:58.530 --> 00:59:01.800
In general dimension, which
leave you metric invariant,

00:59:01.800 --> 00:59:04.130
leave the Minkowski
metric invariant number

00:59:04.130 --> 00:59:07.210
up to overall factor.

00:59:07.210 --> 00:59:10.070
And the conformal
invariant theory

00:59:10.070 --> 00:59:14.130
is a theory which
[? involves ?] transformations.

00:59:14.130 --> 00:59:16.120
OK?

00:59:16.120 --> 00:59:20.211
And so obviously,
a Yang-Mills theory

00:59:20.211 --> 00:59:22.460
are always invariant on the
translation on the Lorentz

00:59:22.460 --> 00:59:24.220
transformation.

00:59:24.220 --> 00:59:26.250
But when the beta
function is 0, the system

00:59:26.250 --> 00:59:27.440
does not have a scale.

00:59:27.440 --> 00:59:31.180
Then it's invariant
on the scaling.

00:59:31.180 --> 00:59:35.055
But typically, in general,
4 dimensional theory,

00:59:35.055 --> 00:59:36.550
any theory invariant
on the scaling

00:59:36.550 --> 00:59:38.350
is also invariant on
this special conformal

00:59:38.350 --> 00:59:39.550
transformations.

00:59:39.550 --> 00:59:42.110
So actually, the N equal
to 4 super-Yang-Mills

00:59:42.110 --> 00:59:44.140
theory is actually
conformal theory,

00:59:44.140 --> 00:59:47.630
OK, conformally
invariant theory.

00:59:47.630 --> 00:59:51.310
So now, as part
of your p set, you

00:59:51.310 --> 00:59:57.630
can actually see that this
conformal transformations

00:59:57.630 --> 00:59:59.790
in fact [? have ?] 1
to 1 correspondence

00:59:59.790 --> 01:00:04.750
with these isometries
of the AdS.

01:00:04.750 --> 01:00:06.050
OK?

01:00:06.050 --> 01:00:07.750
And this we will see later.

01:00:07.750 --> 01:00:10.690
This is a part, important part
of the relation between AdS.

01:00:13.330 --> 01:00:16.750
This is an important part
of this duality relation.

01:00:16.750 --> 01:00:20.362
It's that the symmetry
have to be the same.

01:00:20.362 --> 01:00:21.320
So you compare the two.

01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:24.840
You can see that, indeed, they
1 to 1 correspond to each other.

01:00:30.930 --> 01:00:38.070
So the conformal transformation
add together give you SO(d,2).

01:00:38.070 --> 01:00:39.650
OK?

01:00:39.650 --> 01:00:45.505
So this is the conformal group,
so-called the conformal group

01:00:45.505 --> 01:00:46.240
in d dimension.

01:00:52.910 --> 01:00:55.940
Then you get to the
[? SO(d,2). ?] OK?

01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:08.200
And but in this theory,
there's actually also

01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:13.000
global symmetry, because the
N equal to 4 super-Yang-Mills

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:17.020
theory come from the D3-brane,
which is a transverse space,

01:01:17.020 --> 01:01:19.580
is the [? rotation of ?]
invariant.

01:01:19.580 --> 01:01:24.750
So this actually our SO(6)
symmetry rotates different phi

01:01:24.750 --> 01:01:26.050
i's.

01:01:26.050 --> 01:01:36.810
So actually, there's also
global SO(6) symmetry,

01:01:36.810 --> 01:01:43.243
which rotates phi i,
OK, and the fermions.

01:01:47.573 --> 01:01:48.073
OK?

01:01:53.460 --> 01:02:03.980
And then when you include
in the supersymmetry

01:02:03.980 --> 01:02:06.320
then you get a huge
symmetry group.

01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:09.630
It's normally called a
super conformal symmetry.

01:02:09.630 --> 01:02:12.480
Anyway, let me just
write some notation down.

01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:13.419
It doesn't matter.

01:02:13.419 --> 01:02:15.710
So if you include the symmetry,
the full symmetry group

01:02:15.710 --> 01:02:17.510
is what we normally call it.

01:02:17.510 --> 01:02:21.520
So this is a super group, so
[? SU(2,2|4) ?] Doesn't matter.

01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:31.930
So the bottom line is that the
N equal to 4 super-Yang-Mills

01:02:31.930 --> 01:02:35.500
theory is the most symmetric
4 dimensional theory.

01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:36.580
OK?

01:02:36.580 --> 01:02:40.250
And almost-- no theory
has more symmetries than N

01:02:40.250 --> 01:02:41.708
equal to 4
super-Yang-Mills theory.

01:02:46.100 --> 01:02:47.064
Any questions?

01:02:47.064 --> 01:02:47.980
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:02:47.980 --> 01:02:48.563
HONG LIU: Yes?

01:02:48.563 --> 01:02:51.198
AUDIENCE: So How do you know
that the [? flows are ?]

01:02:51.198 --> 01:02:53.620
[INAUDIBLE]?

01:02:53.620 --> 01:02:56.250
[? HONG LIU: Though ?] you can
classify it by solving this

01:02:56.250 --> 01:02:58.584
equation.

01:02:58.584 --> 01:03:00.750
You can classify it by
solving this equation.

01:03:04.375 --> 01:03:08.650
AUDIENCE: But what's
the q [INAUDIBLE]?

01:03:08.650 --> 01:03:10.265
HONG LIU: No, this
is just a notation.

01:03:10.265 --> 01:03:11.140
AUDIENCE: A notation?

01:03:11.140 --> 01:03:11.765
HONG LIU: Yeah.

01:03:14.957 --> 01:03:15.790
Any other questions?

01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:21.240
So I can say a few words about
the conformal field theories.

01:03:29.722 --> 01:03:34.100
But it's getting
a little bit late,

01:03:34.100 --> 01:03:35.780
and I want to talk
about other things.

01:03:39.930 --> 01:03:43.660
So let me just say it in words.

01:03:43.660 --> 01:03:46.920
And then you can try to
read it in other places.

01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:50.000
Because even if I just write
a couple formulas here,

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.670
it still won't
change you very much.

01:03:51.670 --> 01:03:52.170
[LAUGHTER]

01:03:52.170 --> 01:03:55.920
I won't teach you too much.

01:03:55.920 --> 01:04:00.790
So important thing about
this conformal field theory

01:04:00.790 --> 01:04:07.110
is that each operator, say
each local operator-- yeah,

01:04:07.110 --> 01:04:10.470
you can classify local operators
by how they transform, say,

01:04:10.470 --> 01:04:12.470
under these
conformal symmetries.

01:04:12.470 --> 01:04:14.490
And then you can
associate, say, a dimension

01:04:14.490 --> 01:04:17.160
to each operator,
related to how they

01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:23.030
transform in these
conformal transformations.

01:04:23.030 --> 01:04:26.200
And then you can also show
that the symmetry actually

01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:30.170
dictates the 2-point function
and the 3-point function

01:04:30.170 --> 01:04:31.990
of such operators.

01:04:31.990 --> 01:04:34.330
And essentially, the structure
of the 2-point function

01:04:34.330 --> 01:04:36.940
and 3-point function
are completely fixed.

01:04:39.495 --> 01:04:41.120
But not higher point
function, but only

01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:42.520
2 and 3-point functions.

01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:48.610
Yeah, so that's essentially it.

01:04:48.610 --> 01:04:52.930
Not much known, many things
are known about conformal field

01:04:52.930 --> 01:04:55.160
theory in 1 plus 1 dimension.

01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:59.790
And but higher
dimensions, yeah, other

01:04:59.790 --> 01:05:02.280
than what I said, not much.

01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:04.386
Not too much more
is known, yeah.

01:05:07.260 --> 01:05:11.760
So any questions regarding this?

01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:17.520
OK, so let me just summarize,
then we can have a break.

01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:19.860
So we can summarize.

01:05:19.860 --> 01:05:24.630
So let me just summarize what
we have done so far, and also,

01:05:24.630 --> 01:05:25.903
with an important refinement.

01:05:31.860 --> 01:05:35.580
So what we said is we
started with two picture.

01:05:35.580 --> 01:05:39.780
One is D-brane with
some open strings,

01:05:39.780 --> 01:05:43.550
and then some closed strings
can interact with it.

01:05:43.550 --> 01:05:46.362
And then when we go to
the low energy limit,

01:05:46.362 --> 01:05:48.070
then we get N equal
to 4 super-Yang-Mills

01:05:48.070 --> 01:06:07.500
theory with, now, I say SU(N)
plus a decoupled U(1), and then

01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:15.640
plus what we discussed last
time, a decoupled the gravitons

01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:17.860
in the low energy limit.

01:06:17.860 --> 01:06:22.290
So let me just write
E equal to 0 limit.

01:06:22.290 --> 01:06:26.580
On the other side, we have this
[? pure, ?] [? geometric ?]

01:06:26.580 --> 01:06:33.400
picture of the curved spacetime
produced by those D-branes.

01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:35.290
So those curved
spacetime at infinity

01:06:35.290 --> 01:06:38.890
behaves like just 10
dimensional Minkowski spacetime.

01:06:38.890 --> 01:06:42.090
And then when you go to
the close to the brane,

01:06:42.090 --> 01:06:46.380
then the space deforms
into the AdS 5 times S5.

01:06:50.860 --> 01:06:55.020
OK, form into AdS 5 times S 5.

01:06:55.020 --> 01:06:59.890
Under the low energy limit,
because 1 into-- we can see

01:06:59.890 --> 01:07:03.230
the string theory in the
[? very ?] [? much ?]

01:07:03.230 --> 01:07:05.780
[? tongue ?] this
[? throat. ?] OK?

01:07:09.130 --> 01:07:13.320
So the low energy limit
is the string theory.

01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:16.380
The one here when you're
take E equal to 0,

01:07:16.380 --> 01:07:25.810
we get string theory
in AdS 5 times S5,

01:07:25.810 --> 01:07:28.485
then plus decoupled graviton.

01:07:36.440 --> 01:07:44.920
Here, also, here, when we look
at the geometry of the brane,

01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:47.560
essentially, we have fixed
the location of the brane.

01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:51.100
So essentially, we have fixed
to the center of mass motion.

01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:54.700
But in principle,
you can allow, also,

01:07:54.700 --> 01:07:56.990
the brane to move anywhere.

01:07:56.990 --> 01:08:03.170
So here, essentially, there's
also a decoupled center

01:08:03.170 --> 01:08:05.830
of mass motion.

01:08:05.830 --> 01:08:08.620
OK?

01:08:08.620 --> 01:08:13.390
So now, let's get rid of
this decoupled graviton.

01:08:13.390 --> 01:08:17.050
Let's get rid of
this decoupled U(1),

01:08:17.050 --> 01:08:19.140
or decoupled center
of mass motion.

01:08:19.140 --> 01:08:22.840
Then what we get is the
fully interacting part.

01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:23.340
OK?

01:08:26.140 --> 01:08:28.000
So the fully interacting
part is so small

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:32.410
refinement than what
we said last time.

01:08:32.410 --> 01:08:37.450
We said N equal to 4
super-Yang-Mill theory

01:08:37.450 --> 01:08:42.890
with [? stage ?] group SU(N)
should be the same as the type

01:08:42.890 --> 01:08:48.340
IIB string in AdS 5 times S5.

01:08:51.270 --> 01:08:53.051
OK?

01:08:53.051 --> 01:08:58.060
So, now, other side,
now, this is SU(N).

01:08:58.060 --> 01:09:02.819
And more precisely, this is AdS
prime S5 in the Poincare patch.

01:09:06.791 --> 01:09:07.290
OK?

01:09:10.420 --> 01:09:11.229
Yes?

01:09:11.229 --> 01:09:13.330
AUDIENCE: The N
just to recall, is

01:09:13.330 --> 01:09:16.140
the that N comes from the
amount of flux on the S5.

01:09:16.140 --> 01:09:16.870
Is that correct?

01:09:16.870 --> 01:09:18.078
HONG LIU: Yeah, that's right.

01:09:18.078 --> 01:09:18.680
That's right.

01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:23.240
So the N here related to
the flux on the AdS 5,

01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:29.510
it's also related,
as we will see,

01:09:29.510 --> 01:09:31.350
related the Newton
Constant, et cetera.

01:09:31.350 --> 01:09:34.670
Yeah, we will see that, yeah.

01:09:34.670 --> 01:09:35.899
OK?

01:09:35.899 --> 01:09:41.779
So now, we can look at
this geometric picture.

01:09:41.779 --> 01:09:42.279
OK?

01:09:42.279 --> 01:09:45.369
We can look at this
geometric picture.

01:09:45.369 --> 01:09:46.994
Then we observer
something interesting.

01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:57.040
So this SU(N) group, let
me say, [INAUDIBLE] R 1,3.

01:09:57.040 --> 01:09:58.050
OK?

01:09:58.050 --> 01:10:00.640
On the 3, approximate
dimensional-- yeah,

01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:08.630
let me write it better--
this SU(N) on the space,

01:10:08.630 --> 01:10:14.790
on the Minkowski space, R 1,3.

01:10:14.790 --> 01:10:18.180
So now, let's note.

01:10:18.180 --> 01:10:22.630
Make a simple observation
based on the geometry of AdS

01:10:22.630 --> 01:10:31.310
is that this R 1,3 is actually
the boundary of AdS 5.

01:10:34.591 --> 01:10:35.090
OK?

01:10:35.090 --> 01:10:37.089
It's essentially the
boundary manifold of AdS 5.

01:10:40.900 --> 01:10:45.346
And the right hand
side, no matter

01:10:45.346 --> 01:10:47.220
whether you do field
theory or string theory,

01:10:47.220 --> 01:10:49.136
you can always do
dimensional reduction on S5.

01:10:49.136 --> 01:10:50.860
You can always
decompose everything

01:10:50.860 --> 01:10:54.420
on S5 in terms harmonics.

01:10:54.420 --> 01:10:57.020
So essentially, the
right hand side,

01:10:57.020 --> 01:11:01.260
because S5 is a compact
space, the right hand side

01:11:01.260 --> 01:11:03.070
is a 5 dimensional
gravity theory.

01:11:11.230 --> 01:11:14.030
OK?

01:11:14.030 --> 01:11:19.515
So we actually now here see a
5 dimensional gravity theory.

01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:25.400
Now, it's equivalent that your
4 dimensional theory [? lives ?]

01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:27.810
on its boundary.

01:11:27.810 --> 01:11:30.330
OK?

01:11:30.330 --> 01:11:36.806
So this really can be considered
[? actually ?] realization

01:11:36.806 --> 01:11:38.230
of holographic principle.

01:11:58.497 --> 01:12:00.580
So actually, there are two
ways to think about it.

01:12:00.580 --> 01:12:05.425
One way is to think from this--
so previously, we motivated.

01:12:08.310 --> 01:12:12.250
Long time ago, we
motivated the duality using

01:12:12.250 --> 01:12:13.890
two perspec-- [INAUDIBLE].

01:12:13.890 --> 01:12:16.499
One is the
holographic principle.

01:12:16.499 --> 01:12:19.040
Some gravity theory should be
[INAUDIBLE] to the [? theory ?]

01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:20.800
living on this boundary.

01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:30.350
And also, motivated that the
Yang-Mills theory in the gauge

01:12:30.350 --> 01:12:34.700
group SU(N) or U(N), when you
do the [? large N ?] expansion,

01:12:34.700 --> 01:12:36.580
then behaves like
a string theory.

01:12:36.580 --> 01:12:37.300
OK?

01:12:37.300 --> 01:12:39.635
So this could also be considered
as an explicit example

01:12:39.635 --> 01:12:41.800
of that relation.

01:12:41.800 --> 01:12:44.300
That this is a Yang-Mill
male theory, and then

01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:46.630
turned out to be [INAUDIBLE]
to a string theory.

01:12:46.630 --> 01:12:49.140
OK?

01:12:49.140 --> 01:12:53.050
So now, if you look
at this statement,

01:12:53.050 --> 01:12:57.040
you say, is this a coincidence?

01:12:57.040 --> 01:13:03.040
Because I don't really see
somehow in this picture

01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:09.410
not so much somehow how why this
Yang-Mills theory is actually

01:13:09.410 --> 01:13:12.600
should be considered as living
on the boundary of AdS 5 times

01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:15.340
S5, because the boundary
of AdS 5 times S5,

01:13:15.340 --> 01:13:16.960
somewhere around here.

01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:18.940
Yeah, I don't see some
Yang-Mills theory living

01:13:18.940 --> 01:13:20.590
on there, OK?

01:13:20.590 --> 01:13:22.690
So is this really
just some coincidence

01:13:22.690 --> 01:13:26.779
that just happened to be that?

01:13:26.779 --> 01:13:28.820
But actually, there's a
very important prediction

01:13:28.820 --> 01:13:31.750
one can make if you
take this point of view.

01:13:35.185 --> 01:13:37.305
Now, I can erase here.

01:13:37.305 --> 01:13:38.880
Maybe I will do it here.

01:13:42.768 --> 01:13:46.260
Yeah, but if you take
this point of view,

01:13:46.260 --> 01:13:48.770
then there's a very important
prediction you can make.

01:13:51.730 --> 01:13:53.660
Then there's a very
important prediction

01:13:53.660 --> 01:13:56.030
you can make, and then
check whether that

01:13:56.030 --> 01:13:57.460
has any chance of working.

01:14:00.020 --> 01:14:05.780
So if you believe this
picture, then we can have

01:14:05.780 --> 01:14:16.820
a [? non-trivial ?] prediction,
because AdS also have

01:14:16.820 --> 01:14:22.789
[? a lot ?] of description
in terms of the global AdS.

01:14:22.789 --> 01:14:24.830
Then let's say, what
happens if we put the string

01:14:24.830 --> 01:14:27.650
theory in this global
AdS, which certainly, we

01:14:27.650 --> 01:14:31.100
should be able to do,
because these two only differ

01:14:31.100 --> 01:14:32.790
by some global structure.

01:14:32.790 --> 01:14:34.110
OK?

01:14:34.110 --> 01:14:35.780
And this is one part of that.

01:14:35.780 --> 01:14:38.480
They only differ by
some global structure.

01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:42.670
So if this is really true,
if this is not a coincidence,

01:14:42.670 --> 01:14:45.770
then we can make a non-trivial
prediction is that N equal to 4

01:14:45.770 --> 01:14:57.100
is a type IIB string in
global AdS 5 times S5.

01:14:57.100 --> 01:14:59.810
So now, the AdS 5 we
take to be the global,

01:14:59.810 --> 01:15:03.380
to take to be the cylinder.

01:15:03.380 --> 01:15:07.140
That should be equal to the N
equals to 4 super-Yang-Mills

01:15:07.140 --> 01:15:11.690
theory, which now, should
live on the boundary

01:15:11.690 --> 01:15:20.990
of that cylinder, which
is our S3 times R. OK?

01:15:20.990 --> 01:15:22.500
So this realization
will give you

01:15:22.500 --> 01:15:26.230
a powerful prediction, which
in principle, you can check.

01:15:26.230 --> 01:15:27.847
OK?

01:15:27.847 --> 01:15:29.555
And, of course, if
this is a coincidence,

01:15:29.555 --> 01:15:31.919
then there's no reason
why this to be true.

01:15:31.919 --> 01:15:33.460
Because from the
brane point of view,

01:15:33.460 --> 01:15:36.090
we cannot really do the sphere.

01:15:36.090 --> 01:15:38.890
OK?

01:15:38.890 --> 01:15:42.294
AUDIENCE: Why is [INAUDIBLE]?

01:15:42.294 --> 01:15:42.794
Oh.

01:15:45.807 --> 01:15:47.390
HONG LIU: So any
questions about this?

01:15:51.309 --> 01:15:52.850
AUDIENCE: One question
[? on that. ?]

01:15:52.850 --> 01:15:56.030
so when we derive the
right hand picture,

01:15:56.030 --> 01:15:59.410
we impose that there's
some charge on the D-brane.

01:15:59.410 --> 01:16:01.670
But on the left
hand side, it seems

01:16:01.670 --> 01:16:04.930
that we-- [INAUDIBLE] a
the charge [INAUDIBLE]?

01:16:04.930 --> 01:16:07.800
HONG LIU: No, the
charge is just reflected

01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:10.940
in open string dynamics.

01:16:10.940 --> 01:16:11.580
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:16:11.580 --> 01:16:14.960
So by your right hand side,
we will have the charge.

01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:16.920
HONG LIU: No, you
essentially have a charge.

01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:18.410
But in that
description, you don't

01:16:18.410 --> 01:16:20.840
need to introduce a charge.

01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:21.560
Whatever charge--

01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:25.060
AUDIENCE: If we impose charge
if the left hand side will never

01:16:25.060 --> 01:16:25.670
be changed?

01:16:25.670 --> 01:16:26.900
HONG LIU: No, no.

01:16:26.900 --> 01:16:29.202
Just there from the side,
you just talk about strings.

01:16:29.202 --> 01:16:29.910
AUDIENCE: Uh-huh.

01:16:29.910 --> 01:16:32.034
HONG LIU: You don't talk
about the whatever charge.

01:16:32.034 --> 01:16:33.685
The charge is a
gravity description.

01:16:33.685 --> 01:16:34.130
AUDIENCE: Uh-huh.

01:16:34.130 --> 01:16:35.950
HONG LIU: The charge don't
even arise in this picture.

01:16:35.950 --> 01:16:36.910
I just have some strings.

01:16:36.910 --> 01:16:37.460
I have some open strings.

01:16:37.460 --> 01:16:38.584
I have some closed strings.

01:16:38.584 --> 01:16:40.869
They interact with each other.

01:16:40.869 --> 01:16:41.410
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:16:41.410 --> 01:16:43.656
And did this picture
go to low energy means

01:16:43.656 --> 01:16:47.602
it will appear as a charge of
the super-Yang-Mills theory.

01:16:47.602 --> 01:16:48.810
HONG LIU: No, no, no, no, no.

01:16:48.810 --> 01:16:49.000
No, no.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.375
This goes [? in ?] [? order. ?]
You just super-Yang-Mills

01:16:51.375 --> 01:16:52.716
theory.

01:16:52.716 --> 01:16:54.840
Yeah.

01:16:54.840 --> 01:16:55.340
Good?

01:16:55.340 --> 01:16:57.210
Any other questions?

01:16:57.210 --> 01:16:57.790
Yes?

01:16:57.790 --> 01:16:59.032
AUDIENCE: Is this true?

01:16:59.032 --> 01:17:00.240
HONG LIU: Yeah, this is true.

01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:00.781
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:17:00.781 --> 01:17:04.470
[LAUGHTER]

01:17:04.470 --> 01:17:07.720
HONG LIU: And the yeah.

01:17:07.720 --> 01:17:13.542
So that means this
is not a fantasy.

01:17:13.542 --> 01:17:15.000
Yeah, this tells
this is a fantasy.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.760
This is actually a
powerful realization.

01:17:17.760 --> 01:17:21.850
This is a powerful
realization, yeah.

01:17:21.850 --> 01:17:25.730
So let me before
conclude-- Let me

01:17:25.730 --> 01:17:31.530
just quickly mention something
just in terms of semantics.

01:17:31.530 --> 01:17:36.830
So I always say, type IIB
string in AdS 5 times S5.

01:17:36.830 --> 01:17:41.310
So you may ask, does this
make sense to say such things?

01:17:41.310 --> 01:17:43.550
Because if we think
this is really

01:17:43.550 --> 01:17:46.050
as a quantum
gravitational theory,

01:17:46.050 --> 01:17:48.050
so if you have a
finite string coupling,

01:17:48.050 --> 01:17:49.960
then everything fluctuates.

01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:54.480
And then why we specify
a rigid spacetime here?

01:17:54.480 --> 01:17:55.390
OK?

01:17:55.390 --> 01:17:57.560
Why do we specify a
rigid spacetime here?

01:18:00.460 --> 01:18:03.900
So the way you should understand
the statement is the following,

01:18:03.900 --> 01:18:06.150
is that indeed, if you,
say, consider the finite G

01:18:06.150 --> 01:18:08.040
Newton, the finite
G string, then

01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:10.860
the spacetime can
fluctuate a lot,

01:18:10.860 --> 01:18:14.920
will typical be a deviate
from AdS 5 times S5.

01:18:14.920 --> 01:18:18.700
But this AdS 5
times S5 specifies

01:18:18.700 --> 01:18:22.170
it's asymptotic geometry of AdS.

01:18:22.170 --> 01:18:24.800
It's asymptotic geometry.

01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:31.030
It's the geometry of AdS very
far away near the boundary.

01:18:31.030 --> 01:18:33.010
And essentially, this
can be considered

01:18:33.010 --> 01:18:36.270
as specifying the
boundary condition

01:18:36.270 --> 01:18:40.040
for gravity, the boundary
condition for the quantum

01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:41.302
gravity.

01:18:41.302 --> 01:18:43.510
So this, essentially, specify
the boundary condition.

01:18:46.070 --> 01:18:49.190
Good, so let's have a
couple minutes break.

01:18:49.190 --> 01:18:52.680
Then we will talk more
about the duality.

01:18:52.680 --> 01:18:53.430
OK, good.

01:18:53.430 --> 01:18:55.346
So let's start again.

01:18:55.346 --> 01:18:59.154
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

01:18:59.154 --> 01:19:04.820
So now, let's move
to a new chapter.

01:19:04.820 --> 01:19:07.840
So now, have we
established the duality.

01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:11.410
So let's try to
understand the duality.

01:19:11.410 --> 01:19:13.980
So let me call it
the duality toolbox.

01:19:17.810 --> 01:19:19.320
And then we can try to use it.

01:19:28.110 --> 01:19:36.410
So first, let me say some
general aspect on the duality.

01:19:36.410 --> 01:19:38.480
Oh, I erased.

01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:40.570
Oh, I should keep
that figure there.

01:19:40.570 --> 01:19:48.030
Anyway, so the first
important thing

01:19:48.030 --> 01:19:49.884
is so-called IR/UV connection.

01:19:57.050 --> 01:20:06.480
So here, we see the equivalents,
say, from the AdS 5 gravity.

01:20:06.480 --> 01:20:09.230
So we have some
AdS 5 gravity to go

01:20:09.230 --> 01:20:18.490
to N equal to 4 super-Yang-Mills
theory in d equal to 4.

01:20:18.490 --> 01:20:20.977
So from this direction, we
may consider as a realization

01:20:20.977 --> 01:20:22.185
of the holographic principle.

01:20:25.710 --> 01:20:27.710
OK?

01:20:27.710 --> 01:20:31.550
We can consider this direction
as a holographic principle.

01:20:31.550 --> 01:20:37.590
And then you may ask, from
the field perspective,

01:20:37.590 --> 01:20:44.659
if we think from this
angle, why somehow,

01:20:44.659 --> 01:20:47.200
this description of the field
theory have one more dimension.

01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:48.640
So this is a 4
dimensional theory.

01:20:48.640 --> 01:20:50.520
This is a 5 dimensional theory.

01:20:50.520 --> 01:20:52.760
OK?

01:20:52.760 --> 01:20:55.430
What does this actual
dimension does?

01:20:55.430 --> 01:20:58.740
What does this x
dimension do, OK?

01:20:58.740 --> 01:21:01.050
How do we understand
from the field theory

01:21:01.050 --> 01:21:05.580
perspective somehow this
increase of one dimension?

01:21:05.580 --> 01:21:07.250
OK?

01:21:07.250 --> 01:21:12.230
So the answer turns out-- the
answer is actually very simple.

01:21:12.230 --> 01:21:16.560
And it's already nice in a way.

01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:18.160
The answer is already
in the way which

01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:20.200
we take the low energy limit.

01:21:20.200 --> 01:21:21.680
OK?

01:21:21.680 --> 01:21:23.810
So remember, when we take
the low energy limit-- so

01:21:23.810 --> 01:21:32.370
let me draw this figure
again-- in the gravity side,

01:21:32.370 --> 01:21:36.320
and this is going
to R goes to 0.

01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:38.780
OK?

01:21:38.780 --> 01:21:45.090
So by studying the red shift
due to the curved spacetime,

01:21:45.090 --> 01:21:48.370
we show that if you want
to go to low energies,

01:21:48.370 --> 01:21:52.350
then you want to go to
smaller and smaller R. OK?

01:21:52.350 --> 01:21:54.150
So you want to go to
smaller and smaller R

01:21:54.150 --> 01:21:57.040
if you want to go to [? lower ?]
and [? lower ?] emerges.

01:21:57.040 --> 01:21:58.580
OK?

01:21:58.580 --> 01:22:05.530
So smaller r, and then
give you smaller energy.

01:22:08.410 --> 01:22:11.020
So we use this
argument to decouple

01:22:11.020 --> 01:22:13.930
this, the other factor.

01:22:13.930 --> 01:22:16.350
We say, if you want
to go to low energy,

01:22:16.350 --> 01:22:17.580
you take r go to 0 limit.

01:22:17.580 --> 01:22:21.310
Then there are infinite
distance between them.

01:22:21.310 --> 01:22:22.850
But the nice thing
about infinities

01:22:22.850 --> 01:22:24.790
is that after you
go to infinity,

01:22:24.790 --> 01:22:27.000
there's still infinite left.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:28.330
OK?

01:22:28.330 --> 01:22:32.390
So the same argument
also applies in AdS,

01:22:32.390 --> 01:22:36.130
in the AdS part, after you
decouple the other stuff.

01:22:36.130 --> 01:22:39.230
And the AdS part of this
argument still applies.

01:22:39.230 --> 01:22:41.060
Still, the same thing happens.

01:22:41.060 --> 01:22:44.599
The same red shift
argument applies.

01:22:44.599 --> 01:22:46.140
So if you want to
go to low energies,

01:22:46.140 --> 01:22:48.260
you want to go to smaller r.

01:22:48.260 --> 01:22:49.810
OK?

01:22:49.810 --> 01:22:55.550
And so this immediately tells
us that this actual dimension,

01:22:55.550 --> 01:23:00.967
this r direction, it's precisely
the direction, which external

01:23:00.967 --> 01:23:02.800
to the N equal to 4
super-Yang-Mills theory,

01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:05.520
transverse to the N equal to
4 super-Yang-Mills theory.

01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:07.561
So this [? immediate ?]
[? here is ?] this actual

01:23:07.561 --> 01:23:12.120
dimension, this r, or in
this coordinate z-- remember,

01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:16.540
in this z, z related to that
thing just by R squared divided

01:23:16.540 --> 01:23:22.030
by r, so that r
related to that z.

01:23:22.030 --> 01:23:27.940
So that the r goes to
0 limit, it tells you

01:23:27.940 --> 01:23:38.490
that that r dimension,
r can be considered,

01:23:38.490 --> 01:23:40.140
this actual dimension
can be considered

01:23:40.140 --> 01:23:58.240
as representing the energy
scale of the Yang-Mills theory,

01:23:58.240 --> 01:24:04.210
OK, or the energy scale
of the boundary theory.

01:24:04.210 --> 01:24:06.420
So if you want to
go to low energy,

01:24:06.420 --> 01:24:10.230
you go down [? farthest ?]
[? route. ?] OK?

01:24:10.230 --> 01:24:14.480
This is a very, very
important point.

01:24:14.480 --> 01:24:18.140
And this nice into many
phenomenon between AdS

01:24:18.140 --> 01:24:20.410
and the CFT and
the disconnection.

01:24:22.940 --> 01:24:25.410
Very important, and if you
have a good understanding,

01:24:25.410 --> 01:24:28.770
it will give you lots
of good intuitions

01:24:28.770 --> 01:24:31.480
in you understand the relation.

01:24:31.480 --> 01:24:35.800
So let me just to elaborate
the argument again,

01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:38.890
now using this metric.

01:24:38.890 --> 01:24:40.700
OK?

01:24:40.700 --> 01:24:44.380
OK, so now, we'll go over
this red shift argument again,

01:24:44.380 --> 01:24:46.871
and to use this metric.

01:24:46.871 --> 01:24:47.370
OK?

01:24:52.590 --> 01:24:57.280
So again, so the key thing
is that the x mu, which

01:24:57.280 --> 01:25:03.280
you t go to x appear
in this metric,

01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:05.120
is defining the boundary unit.

01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:06.950
OK?

01:25:06.950 --> 01:25:11.570
So this defines-- so this
defined in the boundary unit.

01:25:11.570 --> 01:25:17.540
So this is the unit we use
in the Yang-Mills theory.

01:25:17.540 --> 01:25:18.210
OK?

01:25:18.210 --> 01:25:21.700
So those coordinates are
defined in the boundary units.

01:25:21.700 --> 01:25:27.280
So now, if we want to talk
about energies in some bulk,

01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:38.260
say, the local proper
time, and the length,

01:25:38.260 --> 01:25:45.110
and the total proper length
at some, say, at some z,

01:25:45.110 --> 01:25:49.260
OK, so at some
location z in the bulk

01:25:49.260 --> 01:25:53.590
is related by the
standard relation,

01:25:53.590 --> 01:25:55.130
which we can read from there.

01:25:55.130 --> 01:26:00.340
It say d tau should be equal to
R, so this local proper time.

01:26:03.330 --> 01:26:09.060
Local proper time should be
equal to R divided by z dt.

01:26:09.060 --> 01:26:12.470
And the dl, so
local length scale,

01:26:12.470 --> 01:26:18.180
should be a proper length,
should be related R z times dx.

01:26:18.180 --> 01:26:18.680
OK?

01:26:22.448 --> 01:26:24.430
OK, just because of this.

01:26:24.430 --> 01:26:27.720
You can just read it from here.

01:26:27.720 --> 01:26:31.010
Locally, you can always write
this as a Minkowski metric

01:26:31.010 --> 01:26:33.480
in d plus 1 dimension.

01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:35.740
And then for the local
observer, and this

01:26:35.740 --> 01:26:39.300
is the local time, local proper
time and local proper length.

01:26:39.300 --> 01:26:40.490
OK?

01:26:40.490 --> 01:26:43.270
And then this tells
you that you can easily

01:26:43.270 --> 01:26:45.060
invert this relation.

01:26:45.060 --> 01:26:48.150
This tells you the energy
we observe in the Yang-Mills

01:26:48.150 --> 01:26:53.190
theory, was just energy
we measure in terms of t

01:26:53.190 --> 01:26:56.300
should be related to the energy,
which we measure locally,

01:26:56.300 --> 01:27:02.030
so all these relation,
local energy.

01:27:02.030 --> 01:27:07.340
And length scale, now
d in Yang-Mills theory,

01:27:07.340 --> 01:27:14.120
is related to the local
length scale by this relation.

01:27:14.120 --> 01:27:14.620
OK?

01:27:18.120 --> 01:27:20.820
So this is an inverse of
that because of the tau

01:27:20.820 --> 01:27:23.680
and the [? energy. ?] This
is just the same as that.

01:27:26.690 --> 01:27:29.518
OK?

01:27:29.518 --> 01:27:30.018
Good?

01:27:33.890 --> 01:27:39.500
So now, let's consider
the same bulk process.

01:27:39.500 --> 01:27:41.370
OK?

01:27:41.370 --> 01:27:44.860
So let's consider the
same bulk process.

01:27:44.860 --> 01:27:48.570
Say, for example,
this process we

01:27:48.570 --> 01:27:51.700
are sitting in this
classroom, say, supposing we

01:27:51.700 --> 01:27:52.450
[? leaving ?] AdS.

01:27:52.450 --> 01:27:55.670
Let's imagine that happens
at different values of z,

01:27:55.670 --> 01:28:08.748
OK say, for the same bulk
process, at different z.

01:28:14.604 --> 01:28:17.050
OK.

01:28:17.050 --> 01:28:21.330
Then, of course, the E
local, the local energy scale

01:28:21.330 --> 01:28:24.150
and the local length
scale would be the same.

01:28:31.601 --> 01:28:32.100
OK?

01:28:32.100 --> 01:28:33.770
So if we consider
the different process

01:28:33.770 --> 01:28:36.380
at different z, the
same physical process

01:28:36.380 --> 01:28:40.690
at different z, in terms of a
local observers, it's the same.

01:28:40.690 --> 01:28:44.481
So E local and the d
local does not change.

01:28:44.481 --> 01:28:44.980
OK?

01:28:47.780 --> 01:28:55.730
But if you translate into
the Yang-Mills scale,

01:28:55.730 --> 01:28:59.660
then you find now that the
corresponding Yang-Mills energy

01:28:59.660 --> 01:29:05.076
scale now proportional
to 1 over z,

01:29:05.076 --> 01:29:09.030
OK, because now, we
have fixed E local.

01:29:09.030 --> 01:29:09.550
OK?

01:29:09.550 --> 01:29:10.870
We have fixed E local.

01:29:10.870 --> 01:29:12.910
We are changing z.

01:29:12.910 --> 01:29:15.880
So now, you find at a different
location, now corresponding

01:29:15.880 --> 01:29:19.750
to a different energy scale
in the Yang-Mills theory.

01:29:19.750 --> 01:29:25.065
Say, the d Yang-Mills we
will [? portion it ?] to z.

01:29:25.065 --> 01:29:25.565
OK?

01:29:28.350 --> 01:29:52.980
And in particular, for
the same process as z

01:29:52.980 --> 01:30:00.630
equal to 0, if we move this
process close to the boundary--

01:30:00.630 --> 01:30:05.275
z equal to 0 means close
to the boundary-- then

01:30:05.275 --> 01:30:07.400
the Yang-Mills energy, the
corresponding Yang-Mills

01:30:07.400 --> 01:30:10.510
energy, actually
goes to infinity.

01:30:10.510 --> 01:30:12.760
Under the corresponding
Yang-Mills scale,

01:30:12.760 --> 01:30:16.160
actually goes-- distance
scale goes to 0.

01:30:16.160 --> 01:30:18.640
So that means this is
a mapped to some UV

01:30:18.640 --> 01:30:20.295
process in the
Yang-Mills theory.

01:30:29.281 --> 01:30:29.780
OK?

01:30:32.950 --> 01:30:37.060
And but if you take the
z goes to infinity, which

01:30:37.060 --> 01:30:42.206
means you go to interior,
far away from the boundary--

01:30:42.206 --> 01:30:45.110
so you go to infinity, far
away from the boundary,

01:30:45.110 --> 01:30:50.330
go to interior-- then
this E Yang-Mills,

01:30:50.330 --> 01:30:52.380
then the corresponding
Yang-Mills energy scale

01:30:52.380 --> 01:30:54.560
will go to 0.

01:30:54.560 --> 01:30:57.500
And the corresponding
Yang-Mills length scale

01:30:57.500 --> 01:30:59.340
will go to infinity.

01:30:59.340 --> 01:30:59.850
OK?

01:30:59.850 --> 01:31:03.160
So this would corresponding
to the IR process.

01:31:03.160 --> 01:31:05.240
So this will be a
low-energy process,

01:31:05.240 --> 01:31:07.600
and [? much ?] distance
in the Yang-Mills theory.

01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:09.600
So there, of course,
[? those run ?] into the IR

01:31:09.600 --> 01:31:12.310
process in the Yang-Mills.

01:31:12.310 --> 01:31:13.700
OK?

01:31:13.700 --> 01:31:15.350
And [? this-- ?]

01:31:15.350 --> 01:31:18.740
So normally, if you think
about the perspective

01:31:18.740 --> 01:31:25.430
from AdS point of view,
when you go to the boundary,

01:31:25.430 --> 01:31:27.700
means you've got
a long distance.

01:31:27.700 --> 01:31:32.930
So from AdS point of view,
this is going to the IR.

01:31:32.930 --> 01:31:33.760
OK?

01:31:33.760 --> 01:31:36.600
And then when you go to the
infinity, z go to infinity.

01:31:36.600 --> 01:31:39.530
You are going to the
interior in the bulk.

01:31:39.530 --> 01:31:42.450
So roughly, it's not precisely--
[? if you ?] [? risk, ?] you

01:31:42.450 --> 01:31:44.700
can think of this actually
going to the short distance

01:31:44.700 --> 01:31:49.960
in the-- not really the
short distance, just-- yeah,

01:31:49.960 --> 01:31:52.460
this name is not very proper,
but let's just call it the UV.

01:31:52.460 --> 01:31:55.720
Just go into the
interior of the bulk.

01:31:55.720 --> 01:31:58.190
So now, since you see an
[? opposite ?] process going

01:31:58.190 --> 01:32:01.774
on, in the AdS will go to IR.

01:32:01.774 --> 01:32:03.690
Then from the Yang-Mills
theory, corresponding

01:32:03.690 --> 01:32:10.280
to going to the UV, but in
the AdS, you go to interior.

01:32:10.280 --> 01:32:11.780
And then from the
Yang-Mills theory,

01:32:11.780 --> 01:32:14.200
corresponding to go
to the IR low energy.

01:32:14.200 --> 01:32:14.940
OK?

01:32:14.940 --> 01:32:19.027
So here, we have something
like IR-UV connection.

01:32:25.205 --> 01:32:25.705
OK?

01:32:28.460 --> 01:32:35.910
In particular, I already
said in particular once.

01:32:35.910 --> 01:32:40.160
[LAUGHS] So but I
don't have other words.

01:32:40.160 --> 01:32:41.575
So in particular--

01:32:41.575 --> 01:32:44.020
[LAUGHTER]

01:32:44.020 --> 01:32:48.610
--if you really consider the
typical gravity process, OK,

01:32:48.610 --> 01:32:54.710
so if you consider the
typical gravity process,

01:32:54.710 --> 01:32:58.910
so not consider string
theory, just consider gravity.

01:32:58.910 --> 01:33:01.010
Typical gravity process,
a classical gravity

01:33:01.010 --> 01:33:06.660
processes, then essentially,
the curvature radius

01:33:06.660 --> 01:33:07.880
defines your scale.

01:33:07.880 --> 01:33:08.850
OK?

01:33:08.850 --> 01:33:12.330
So that means that the
typical gravity processes,

01:33:12.330 --> 01:33:16.040
the E local is of order 1
over the curvature scale.

01:33:16.040 --> 01:33:19.200
And the typical length
scale in the bulk,

01:33:19.200 --> 01:33:23.310
you can also see that it's
also the curvature radius.

01:33:23.310 --> 01:33:29.680
So in these cases, if you
plug this into this relation,

01:33:29.680 --> 01:33:32.920
then you can see that for
the typical bulk process,

01:33:32.920 --> 01:33:37.410
you can really identify the
E Yang-Mills, essentially,

01:33:37.410 --> 01:33:40.270
just with the radial
direction, OK,

01:33:40.270 --> 01:33:45.400
because this product will be 1.

01:33:45.400 --> 01:33:47.780
This product will be of order 1.

01:33:47.780 --> 01:33:53.400
And then you can really just
identify the z, the inverse

01:33:53.400 --> 01:33:55.330
z with the Yang-Mills energy.

01:33:55.330 --> 01:33:57.940
OK?

01:33:57.940 --> 01:34:02.440
So let me just say this
in the little bit slide

01:34:02.440 --> 01:34:07.740
today, in the picture.

01:34:07.740 --> 01:34:11.100
Maybe I'll do it here,
maybe just do it here.

01:34:11.100 --> 01:34:14.360
So think about this
in the picture.

01:34:14.360 --> 01:34:15.750
So suppose this is a boundary.

01:34:18.650 --> 01:34:20.655
So this is the picture.

01:34:25.880 --> 01:34:30.460
This is the picture, which
on the back page of the class

01:34:30.460 --> 01:34:32.540
it said, if you consider
some process here,

01:34:32.540 --> 01:34:34.980
which we draw a
cow, which I don't

01:34:34.980 --> 01:34:36.623
know how to draw a cow here.

01:34:36.623 --> 01:34:38.100
[LAUGHTER]

01:34:38.100 --> 01:34:41.950
And at some distance,
say, here, some value

01:34:41.950 --> 01:34:46.640
of z here, and similar process
as some other value of z,

01:34:46.640 --> 01:34:50.550
then the corresponding
boundary image of them,

01:34:50.550 --> 01:34:53.210
so this will corresponding
to a bigger guy.

01:34:53.210 --> 01:34:55.880
And this guy will corresponding
slightly small guy.

01:34:55.880 --> 01:34:56.530
OK?

01:34:56.530 --> 01:34:59.100
Yeah, I hope you
understand the picture.

01:34:59.100 --> 01:35:02.160
Yeah, [? so ?] the
further away, the same

01:35:02.160 --> 01:35:05.430
process in the interior,
they corresponding

01:35:05.430 --> 01:35:09.810
to a process with a larger
distance and a lower energy

01:35:09.810 --> 01:35:12.250
from the field
theory perspective.

01:35:12.250 --> 01:35:12.750
OK?

01:35:24.505 --> 01:35:25.880
So now, let me
make some remarks.

01:35:29.890 --> 01:35:32.430
Yeah, I did not
show it very well.

01:35:32.430 --> 01:35:35.440
Is this clear what I
mean by this picture?

01:35:35.440 --> 01:35:36.420
OK, good.

01:35:40.830 --> 01:35:42.560
Yeah, a more fancy
picture is just

01:35:42.560 --> 01:35:43.815
in the web page of the class.

01:35:46.535 --> 01:35:47.910
So now, let me
make some remarks.

01:35:52.660 --> 01:36:00.630
The first remarks is that
the AdS, if you, say,

01:36:00.630 --> 01:36:05.780
calculate the volume
of AdS, so calculate

01:36:05.780 --> 01:36:09.500
the determinant of this guy,
square root of the determinant

01:36:09.500 --> 01:36:11.180
of the metric,
and then integrate

01:36:11.180 --> 01:36:12.330
over the [? O ?] space.

01:36:12.330 --> 01:36:14.220
Then you find it's divergent.

01:36:14.220 --> 01:36:15.890
And particularly,
it's divergent because

01:36:15.890 --> 01:36:21.480
of the infinite distance
in going to the boundary.

01:36:21.480 --> 01:36:22.590
OK?

01:36:22.590 --> 01:36:27.800
So often, we will, say, put
some cut-off, IR cut-off,

01:36:27.800 --> 01:36:29.550
near the boundary,
say, rather than

01:36:29.550 --> 01:36:32.200
let z go all the
way to z equal to 0.

01:36:32.200 --> 01:36:36.300
We, say, we stop the space at
z equal to some [? epsilon. ?]

01:36:36.300 --> 01:36:37.080
OK?

01:36:37.080 --> 01:36:39.650
That's the procedure
we often do, just

01:36:39.650 --> 01:36:41.630
as a mathematical convenience.

01:36:41.630 --> 01:36:44.130
Because if you go all
the way to z equal to 0,

01:36:44.130 --> 01:36:45.890
then this factor blows up.

01:36:45.890 --> 01:36:49.210
And then many things
become tricky to do.

01:36:49.210 --> 01:36:53.320
And then we often, in order
to get the finite answer,

01:36:53.320 --> 01:36:56.490
we always put the z--
put the boundary at z

01:36:56.490 --> 01:36:57.520
equal to some epsilon.

01:36:57.520 --> 01:36:59.030
And epsilon's some
small parameter.

01:36:59.030 --> 01:37:00.690
OK?

01:37:00.690 --> 01:37:05.105
So and for example, this is
what you will do in your p set,

01:37:05.105 --> 01:37:08.190
in one of the p set problem.

01:37:08.190 --> 01:37:11.190
OK, when we try
to-- when you will

01:37:11.190 --> 01:37:12.555
check this holographic bound.

01:37:12.555 --> 01:37:14.430
And that's the trick
[? you're ?] [? ready ?]

01:37:14.430 --> 01:37:17.490
to use.

01:37:17.490 --> 01:37:30.760
So putting the IR
cut-off in AdS, at some z

01:37:30.760 --> 01:37:37.030
equal to epsilon, then
from this IR-UV picture,

01:37:37.030 --> 01:37:41.555
then translate in the boundary.

01:37:45.030 --> 01:37:51.290
In the boundary, we introduce
a short distance cut-off,

01:37:51.290 --> 01:38:02.110
or UV cut-off, say, at
some short distance scale,

01:38:02.110 --> 01:38:08.310
say, [? data ?] x say or order
epsilon, or energy cut-off,

01:38:08.310 --> 01:38:17.660
or UV energy cut-off
at, say, energy, say,

01:38:17.660 --> 01:38:18.660
of order 1 over epsilon.

01:38:18.660 --> 01:38:19.160
OK?

01:38:26.100 --> 01:38:30.850
So this just a [? natural-- ?]
the reason this

01:38:30.850 --> 01:38:37.270
goes 1 into a UV cut-off
because of this relation,

01:38:37.270 --> 01:38:39.120
because of this relation.

01:38:39.120 --> 01:38:43.940
When you cut-off
the space at some z,

01:38:43.940 --> 01:38:46.690
then you can no longer
go to infinite energy.

01:38:46.690 --> 01:38:50.230
You can no longer go to
infinite distance scale, OK?

01:38:50.230 --> 01:38:53.380
And essentially, equivalently
providing a short distance

01:38:53.380 --> 01:38:55.510
cut-off from that relation.

01:38:55.510 --> 01:38:57.990
OK?

01:38:57.990 --> 01:38:59.570
Is it clear?

01:38:59.570 --> 01:39:02.612
And you will use
this in your p set.

01:39:02.612 --> 01:39:03.112
OK?

01:39:13.970 --> 01:39:18.895
So the second remark is that
here, we are considering,

01:39:18.895 --> 01:39:21.120
so N equal to 4 super-Yang-Mills
theory, as we said,

01:39:21.120 --> 01:39:23.200
it's a conformal theory.

01:39:23.200 --> 01:39:26.340
Or it's a scale
invariant theory.

01:39:26.340 --> 01:39:28.020
A feature for scale
invariant theory

01:39:28.020 --> 01:39:31.410
is that there's no scale.

01:39:31.410 --> 01:39:35.060
There's no scale means you can
have arbitrarily low energy

01:39:35.060 --> 01:39:36.310
excitations.

01:39:36.310 --> 01:39:38.320
OK?

01:39:38.320 --> 01:39:54.560
So for conformal theory,
say, in R(1,3), there exists,

01:39:54.560 --> 01:39:58.750
because of the scale invariants,
there exist arbitrarily low

01:39:58.750 --> 01:39:59.555
energy excitations.

01:40:15.010 --> 01:40:16.530
OK?

01:40:16.530 --> 01:40:20.520
So from this IR-UV,
then this corresponding

01:40:20.520 --> 01:40:25.610
to-- then this just
map to the z equal

01:40:25.610 --> 01:40:29.050
to infinity region in the bulk.

01:40:29.050 --> 01:40:29.550
OK?

01:40:38.194 --> 01:40:40.610
So this map to the z equal to
infinity region in the bulk.

01:40:43.350 --> 01:40:47.010
So it's a very good
thing that this z

01:40:47.010 --> 01:40:49.780
equal to infinity region.

01:40:49.780 --> 01:40:50.280
OK?

01:40:50.280 --> 01:40:53.200
It's a very good thing, this
z equal to infinity region,

01:40:53.200 --> 01:40:58.729
because otherwise, those
modes have nothing to map to.

01:40:58.729 --> 01:41:00.270
So on the other
hand, even the theory

01:41:00.270 --> 01:41:12.440
have a gap, on the
other hand, if, say,

01:41:12.440 --> 01:41:35.230
if the corresponding bulk
spacetime, say, "ends"

01:41:35.230 --> 01:41:45.060
at the finite proper distance,
OK, so important thing

01:41:45.060 --> 01:41:46.300
is the following.

01:41:46.300 --> 01:41:47.695
So let's take any point here.

01:41:50.340 --> 01:41:51.650
Take any point here.

01:41:51.650 --> 01:41:54.610
So this is some
reference scale, say.

01:41:54.610 --> 01:41:59.300
Choose it as a reference
scale in the field theory,

01:41:59.300 --> 01:42:01.600
because of this [? UV ?]
[? R ?] connection.

01:42:01.600 --> 01:42:04.150
So now, we want to consider
arbitrary low energy scale

01:42:04.150 --> 01:42:05.816
compared to this scale.

01:42:05.816 --> 01:42:07.440
Then what you want
to do, then you just

01:42:07.440 --> 01:42:10.030
you go to z equal to infinity.

01:42:10.030 --> 01:42:15.080
And this, what is
actually hidden here

01:42:15.080 --> 01:42:17.520
when you do this
argument, is actually

01:42:17.520 --> 01:42:21.275
the proper distance going to z
equal to infinity is infinite.

01:42:21.275 --> 01:42:25.950
And because when you do
this proper distance, yeah,

01:42:25.950 --> 01:42:28.200
essentially, there's infinite
proper distance [? in ?]

01:42:28.200 --> 01:42:29.660
go to z equal to infinity.

01:42:29.660 --> 01:42:32.220
And then you can go to
infinite low energy scales.

01:42:32.220 --> 01:42:34.310
OK?

01:42:34.310 --> 01:42:43.380
But now, if you look
at the global AdS,

01:42:43.380 --> 01:42:46.190
then take some interior point.

01:42:46.190 --> 01:42:49.810
Then actually, you
can easily check.

01:42:49.810 --> 01:42:55.570
When you go to the most interior
point, it's just ro equal to 0.

01:42:55.570 --> 01:42:56.390
OK?

01:42:56.390 --> 01:42:58.440
And that is finite
proper distance away.

01:42:58.440 --> 01:43:01.075
So in some sense,
the spacetime ends

01:43:01.075 --> 01:43:05.600
at the finite proper distance
in the radial direction.

01:43:05.600 --> 01:43:08.090
OK?

01:43:08.090 --> 01:43:13.620
In this case, if you apply
this, this will tell you that

01:43:13.620 --> 01:43:17.285
the theory cannot have arbitrary
low energy excitations.

01:43:20.020 --> 01:43:22.467
OK?

01:43:22.467 --> 01:43:23.050
Is this clear?

01:43:31.430 --> 01:43:33.590
Let me just say it again.

01:43:33.590 --> 01:43:38.660
In this theory, in the
Poincare patch, in the bulk,

01:43:38.660 --> 01:43:41.090
we can go to z
equal to infinity.

01:43:41.090 --> 01:43:44.110
And that's infinite
proper distance away.

01:43:44.110 --> 01:43:46.190
And using this UV
IR argument, that

01:43:46.190 --> 01:43:49.720
translates to infinite low
energy process in the field

01:43:49.720 --> 01:43:51.480
theory.

01:43:51.480 --> 01:43:55.120
But now, let's consider what's
happening in the global AdS.

01:43:55.120 --> 01:43:57.260
Just from the geometry,
we see something dramatic

01:43:57.260 --> 01:44:02.330
happens, because now,
this is a cylinder.

01:44:02.330 --> 01:44:04.100
And look at the metric.

01:44:04.100 --> 01:44:07.470
You take finite
distance from some point

01:44:07.470 --> 01:44:10.450
to go to the most center
point, which is rho 0.

01:44:10.450 --> 01:44:13.490
So you no longer have
infinite distance to go to.

01:44:13.490 --> 01:44:17.560
So if this argument
is consistent,

01:44:17.560 --> 01:44:21.810
then this must be
due to a theory

01:44:21.810 --> 01:44:24.831
without arbitrary low
energy excitation.

01:44:24.831 --> 01:44:25.330
OK?

01:44:29.620 --> 01:44:31.980
But this is, indeed, the
case, because according

01:44:31.980 --> 01:44:35.150
to what I erased,
just before we break,

01:44:35.150 --> 01:44:39.600
we say for the gravity theory
in the global AdS, that

01:44:39.600 --> 01:44:42.220
should be due to a
Yang-Mills theory,

01:44:42.220 --> 01:44:44.100
and the boundary
over here, which

01:44:44.100 --> 01:44:50.870
is S times R. For any field
theory [? under ?] S-- again,

01:44:50.870 --> 01:44:53.150
this is a compact
manifold-- then

01:44:53.150 --> 01:44:56.900
there's a mass gap
from the vacuum.

01:44:56.900 --> 01:44:59.540
And so this theory
actually have a mass gap.

01:44:59.540 --> 01:45:00.060
OK?

01:45:00.060 --> 01:45:02.840
So that means if the
corresponding bulk space that

01:45:02.840 --> 01:45:19.410
ends this on finite proper
distance, the boundary theory

01:45:19.410 --> 01:45:29.890
must have a mass
gap, and vice versa.

01:45:29.890 --> 01:45:32.850
If the fields theory
have a mass gap,

01:45:32.850 --> 01:45:35.940
which you cannot go to
arbitrary low energies,

01:45:35.940 --> 01:45:38.330
and then the bulk spacetime
have to be end somewhere.

01:45:41.040 --> 01:45:44.270
Otherwise, these
statements will not apply.

01:45:44.270 --> 01:45:45.650
OK?

01:45:45.650 --> 01:45:47.980
So consistency check
of that statement

01:45:47.980 --> 01:45:50.120
is that this has to be true.

01:45:50.120 --> 01:45:50.620
OK?

01:45:50.620 --> 01:45:52.350
So in the p set,
you should think

01:45:52.350 --> 01:45:56.220
through these for the
process over the field theory

01:45:56.220 --> 01:45:57.102
on the cylinder.

01:45:57.102 --> 01:45:57.602
OK?

01:46:01.450 --> 01:46:05.012
OK, I think I will stop here.

01:46:05.012 --> 01:46:08.150
Do you have any
questions regarding this?

01:46:08.150 --> 01:46:09.000
Yes?

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.086
AUDIENCE: I was somewhat
under the impression

01:46:11.086 --> 01:46:12.580
that the global AdS
and the Poincare patch

01:46:12.580 --> 01:46:14.580
were just different
coordinates for presentation

01:46:14.580 --> 01:46:17.062
with the same thing, sort of?

01:46:17.062 --> 01:46:20.060
So how -- would that be correct?

01:46:20.060 --> 01:46:20.650
HONG LIU: Hm?

01:46:20.650 --> 01:46:22.150
AUDIENCE: I was
under the impression

01:46:22.150 --> 01:46:23.962
that the global AdS
and the Poincare patch

01:46:23.962 --> 01:46:28.024
are just different coordinate
charts on the same sort

01:46:28.024 --> 01:46:29.190
of structure or [INAUDIBLE].

01:46:29.190 --> 01:46:30.350
HONG LIU: Yeah.

01:46:30.350 --> 01:46:32.758
AUDIENCE: So why do we have
infinite distance in one

01:46:32.758 --> 01:46:34.494
and finite distance in another?

01:46:34.494 --> 01:46:36.610
Is that?

01:46:36.610 --> 01:46:38.890
HONG LIU: Figured out.

01:46:38.890 --> 01:46:40.590
Figured it out.

01:46:40.590 --> 01:46:42.010
And this is geometry.

01:46:42.010 --> 01:46:44.660
You can just look at them.

01:46:44.660 --> 01:46:49.310
It depend on how you
slice the spacetime.

01:46:49.310 --> 01:46:50.900
Yeah, it's very easy to see.

01:46:50.900 --> 01:46:54.667
Just see how you map one point
to the other point, et cetera.

01:46:54.667 --> 01:46:55.166
Yeah.

01:46:55.166 --> 01:46:56.940
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:46:56.940 --> 01:47:01.270
HONG LIU: But the important
thing, the important thing

01:47:01.270 --> 01:47:07.560
is that the-- yeah,
I'll give you a hint.

01:47:07.560 --> 01:47:10.310
So this z equal to
infinity can be considered

01:47:10.310 --> 01:47:13.190
as a coordinate singularity
of that [? thing. ?]

01:47:13.190 --> 01:47:15.770
so even though here
it's completely smooth,

01:47:15.770 --> 01:47:18.649
but in here is like a coordinate
singularity because of this.

01:47:18.649 --> 01:47:19.190
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:47:19.190 --> 01:47:21.800
HONG LIU: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:47:21.800 --> 01:47:26.590
Yeah, so that's why, actually,
to talk about theory on R3

01:47:26.590 --> 01:47:30.140
and the theory on S3 is heading
[? on 2 ?] because the physics

01:47:30.140 --> 01:47:31.260
are very different.

01:47:31.260 --> 01:47:35.140
Because here, yeah,
because here, you always

01:47:35.140 --> 01:47:36.560
have a mass gap.

01:47:36.560 --> 01:47:38.260
And here, you don't.

01:47:38.260 --> 01:47:41.940
And so that refract the
geometry very different.

01:47:41.940 --> 01:47:44.270
The way you view the
geometry are very different.

01:47:47.770 --> 01:47:50.355
AUDIENCE: So the
[INAUDIBLE] 5 [INAUDIBLE]?

01:47:50.355 --> 01:47:51.180
HONG LIU: Hm?

01:47:51.180 --> 01:47:52.263
AUDIENCE: The [INAUDIBLE]?

01:47:52.263 --> 01:47:53.694
HONG LIU: Yeah,
yeah. [INAUDIBLE]

01:47:53.694 --> 01:47:56.079
AUDIENCE: But if you
change this [INAUDIBLE],

01:47:56.079 --> 01:47:58.619
then it's still N equal 4
super-Yang-Mills [INAUDIBLE].

01:47:58.619 --> 01:48:00.410
HONG LIU: Yeah, it
would be something else.

01:48:00.410 --> 01:48:01.243
AUDIENCE: Then yeah.

01:48:01.243 --> 01:48:03.940
HONG LIU: Yeah, yeah.

01:48:03.940 --> 01:48:07.290
[APPLAUSE]
