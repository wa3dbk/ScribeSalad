00:00:21.077 --> 00:00:21.660
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:22.420
Good.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.900
So let us start.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:32.369
So last time, we talked about
finding the spacetime geometry

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.180
produced by D3 brane.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.450
Such just based on symmetry,
you can write down the metric

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:41.690
as the following.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:58.730
So it's some function, and
then a Minkowski metric--

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.975
a Minkowski metric for
the 3 plus 1 direction.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:13.910
And then the path for the
transverse direction, which

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.690
you have rotation symmetry.

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:26.296
So you should think of h--
the D3 brane as a point in R6,

00:01:26.296 --> 00:01:27.670
then there's a
spherical symmetry

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.950
in R6 around this point.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.555
And then there are other
3 plus 1 direction, which

00:01:33.555 --> 00:01:35.250
is this 3 plus 1 direction.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.680
OK?

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:43.150
So when you solve the
Einstein equation--

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:51.400
when you find that this f,
h, can be solved explicitly

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.760
by the following form--
some other function

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:06.800
of H by the same function,
with H given by--

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:12.230
and R is the constant, which
is given by the following form.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.970
So R essentially
have the form of

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:30.570
some constant,
Newton constant times

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.880
the tension of the D3 brane.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.107
And then you have N of them.

00:02:35.107 --> 00:02:37.440
And then this can also be--
if you've written everything

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.711
in terms of Gs and
alpha prime, it

00:02:40.711 --> 00:02:44.370
can be written as 4 pi gs
and alpha prime squared.

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.870
OK?

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.330
So this R-- so this is
just like what you normally

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.590
see in the Schwarzchild metric.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.480
It's now G times the mass.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.990
Except, because of the
translation symmetry

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.440
in this 3 plus 1 direction,
so we have the tension

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.270
appear here.

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.907
So GN is proportional
to-- so Newton constant is

00:03:06.907 --> 00:03:09.410
proportional to gs squared.

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.770
And T3 is proportional
to 1 over gs.

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.435
So this product is
proportional to gs.

00:03:15.435 --> 00:03:16.140
OK?

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.170
And there's N of them.

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.600
So there's N here.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.780
And on dimension of ground,
this is dimension 4.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.760
So you have alpha
prime squared here.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:25.450
OK?

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.075
So again, you can
write down everything

00:03:27.075 --> 00:03:28.380
on dimensional ground.

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.580
And the only thing
is just this 4 pi.

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:31.874
You have to be careful.

00:03:31.874 --> 00:03:32.374
OK?

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.260
So this is the full
D3 brane metric.

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.310
So this is the full
D3 brane metric.

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:49.430
So now let's understand a little
bit of physics of this metric,

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.394
which gave us a
deeper understanding

00:03:52.394 --> 00:03:53.560
of the physics of D3 branes.

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:01.690
So first, let's consider
various regime of r.

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.370
OK?

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:09.520
So let's consider, say-- first
consider r goes to infinity.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:15.120
So in r goes to infinity,
Hr just become 1.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.690
H just become 1.

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:19.300
OK?

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:24.710
And then you just recover
a 10-dimensional Minkowski

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.990
metric.

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:28.090
OK?

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:29.670
So this is very
easy to understand.

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.500
You are infinity away
from the D3 brane.

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.420
Of course, you
don't feel anything.

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:37.460
And so you just recovered
the 10-dimensional Minkowski

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:38.540
spacetime.

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:39.530
So here is 1.

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.230
Here is 1.

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:44.180
Just is a funny way to write
down 10-dimensional Minkowski

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:45.270
spacetime.

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.740
So this is just
a flat R6 metric.

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.330
OK?

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.960
And now-- let's now
consider r go to infinity

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.590
is just only r
much, much smaller

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:06.150
than R-- than this capital R.
Then this function-- so again,

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:07.200
let me call this f.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:12.710
Let me call this
H. So for example--

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:14.840
did I call them H or g?

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.340
H. Yeah.

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:20.890
So for example, the f-- it's a
similar thing with g, with H.

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:25.140
So the f will be 1 plus--
so something of order R

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:29.585
to the power of 4 divided
by r to the power of 4.

00:05:29.585 --> 00:05:33.451
Similar with the H.

00:05:33.451 --> 00:05:38.980
So now you recognize
that this 1 over r4

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:58.250
is precisely long range Coulomb
potential in six dimension.

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:58.750
OK?

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:00.350
In R6.

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:03.762
Because only transverse
direction matters.

00:06:03.762 --> 00:06:05.970
And in three spacial
dimensions, if you have a point,

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:08.930
then you have 1 over r.

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:13.030
And in six dimensions, then you
again-- you go down two powers,

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:15.640
and then you get 1 over r4.

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:19.090
So this behavior can
simply be understood--

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:21.875
say, essentially, as you have
some kind of Coulomb potential.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.010
Both due to the--
say the conserved--

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:32.700
both due to the
charge of the brane

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:34.230
and also due to the gravity.

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:35.800
OK?

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.875
So you have some
long range potential.

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:50.800
So now the interesting thing--
things become more interesting

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:56.140
is when r become of order
R. When r become order R,

00:06:56.140 --> 00:07:01.540
then this Hr start to be
significantly different from 1.

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:02.420
OK?

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:06.800
And then that
tells you-- so this

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:16.590
is the-- when r order 1,
the deformation-- yeah,

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:31.280
at this range, the deformation
of spacetime metric from D3

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:35.936
branes becomes significant.

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:43.250
OK?

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:47.700
So in other words, this
capital R, this constant,

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:53.530
essentially signals the
distance from the brane

00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:59.340
where the gravitational
effect becomes strong.

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:00.240
OK?

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:05.980
The gravitational effect of
the D brane becomes strong.

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:08.610
And in particular, you
can check yourself.

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:16.710
You can calculate yourself the
curvature radius now become

00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:21.490
of order R. Or the
curvature itself-- yeah,

00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:24.260
let me just say the
curvature itself becomes R

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:28.930
to the minus 2.

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:30.550
OK?

00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:36.640
So essentially, the
R gives you a measure

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:39.850
of when the gravity
becomes strong,

00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:43.316
or the scale of the curvature.

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:49.985
So we solve this
metric in the context

00:08:49.985 --> 00:08:52.110
of the super gravity-- in
the context of low energy

00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:55.020
effect of super gravity.

00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:58.270
So in order for the
approximation to work,

00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:01.820
we said before, we wanted alpha
prime times the curvature to be

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:03.340
much, much smaller than 1.

00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:04.720
So we said less time.

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:08.000
So that means we want this
to be much, much smaller

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.760
than 1 so that the super gravity
approximation can be valid.

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:17.160
So now, if you look at
expression of the R,

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:21.020
so this tells you that
the gsN must be much,

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:22.550
much greater than 1.

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:23.050
OK?

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:28.340
Yes.

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:32.140
N must be much,
much greater than 1.

00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:36.070
And also, in order to have the
string loop crack into small,

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:38.892
we also need gs to be
much, much smaller than 1.

00:09:38.892 --> 00:09:40.850
So we need gsN to be
much, much greater than 1,

00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:43.230
but also gs to be much,
much smaller than 1.

00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:51.131
So in order for the-- super
gravity approximation to work.

00:09:51.131 --> 00:09:51.630
OK?

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:58.930
So now let's consider--
so when we set up

00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:04.710
the problem, so this metric
is written that r equal to 0

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:06.050
is the location of the brane.

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:07.760
OK?

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:10.310
r equal to 0 is the
location of the brane.

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:15.550
When we solve this
problem, i equal to 0

00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:17.990
is the presumed
location of the brane.

00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:22.930
So now let's see what
happens when we-- yeah,

00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:24.740
that's where you put the source.

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:25.510
OK?

00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:27.630
That's where you put the source.

00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:30.890
So now let's consider--
now let's ask

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:40.680
the question, what happens
to the metric if r goes to 0?

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:42.590
If we try to approach the brane.

00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:44.310
OK?

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:47.420
We try to approach brane.

00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:50.970
So this is very easy to do.

00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:54.575
So when r become much smaller
than r to the capital R,

00:10:54.575 --> 00:10:58.160
when r goes to 0, then
in this expression,

00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:59.860
this term will dominate.

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:01.030
OK?

00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:02.250
We can forget about the 1.

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:03.920
This term will dominate.

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:11.690
So in this case, the H will
be given by R to the 4-- R4.

00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:12.720
OK?

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:17.450
Then we just plug this
into your original metric.

00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:18.090
OK?

00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:19.090
So you plug this back.

00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:36.960
So when you plug this back-- so
H is equal to-- so H minus 1/2

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:41.020
then just become r squared
divided by R squared.

00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:45.850
Then we still have dt
squared plus dx squared.

00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:49.850
Then plus R squared
divided by r squared.

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:53.470
So it's positive 1/2.

00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:56.850
Then dr squared plus r squared.

00:11:56.850 --> 00:11:58.310
d omega 5 squared.

00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:02.230
OK?

00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:13.251
But now something
miraculous happened.

00:12:13.251 --> 00:12:14.500
Something miraculous happened.

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:17.170
So let me slightly
write this metric

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:19.265
in the slightly
more explicit way.

00:12:19.265 --> 00:12:31.080
When I write it-- so let me
just separate these two terms.

00:12:38.235 --> 00:12:40.176
OK?

00:12:40.176 --> 00:12:41.925
So there are two
important thing happened.

00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:46.790
There are two important
thing happened.

00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:53.911
Just to give you a-- yeah,
let me just do it here.

00:12:53.911 --> 00:12:54.410
Yeah.

00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:55.440
Let me do it here.

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:56.980
Maybe it's good enough.

00:12:56.980 --> 00:12:59.470
Maybe that would be
good, just to be safe.

00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:02.970
So previously, let's just
draw the product like this.

00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:05.061
So let's call this R6.

00:13:05.061 --> 00:13:05.560
OK?

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:11.470
Just for my purpose-- yeah,
let's consider this is the R6.

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:19.940
And yeah, forget
about what's outside.

00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:23.850
Just imagine the-- yeah.

00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:25.146
There's no outside.

00:13:25.146 --> 00:13:26.270
Just the whole thing is R6.

00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:27.280
OK?

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.520
And when we start
solving this problem,

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:34.490
the D3 brane-- D3 branes
are a point in this R6.

00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:38.550
And then, there's some
flux coming out of it.

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:39.050
OK?

00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:42.160
There's some F5 flux
coming out of it.

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:43.706
So this is the picture.

00:13:43.706 --> 00:13:47.047
AUDIENCE: The flux
is normal to the F6?

00:13:47.047 --> 00:13:47.630
PROFESSOR: Hm?

00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:50.667
AUDIENCE: The flux
is normal to R6?

00:13:50.667 --> 00:13:51.250
PROFESSOR: No.

00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:55.929
The flux is normal to the
S5 surrounding the point.

00:13:55.929 --> 00:13:56.720
And just like that.

00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:00.630
I'm just saying, think about
the plane as a whole R6.

00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:02.506
There's nothing
outside the plane.

00:14:02.506 --> 00:14:03.260
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:04.050
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:05.966
I want to reserve the
things outside the plane

00:14:05.966 --> 00:14:07.310
for other purpose.

00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:09.210
I just now think about
R6 is the whole thing.

00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:11.710
This is your whole space.

00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:13.330
OK?

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:16.510
So if you look at
this situation,

00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:18.880
there are two things.

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:22.760
First, there's a
source at i equal to 0.

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:27.520
You should see a data function
which is a source of the flux

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:28.970
and is a source of the mass.

00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:29.470
OK?

00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:31.554
There's some tension there.

00:14:31.554 --> 00:14:32.970
And the other thing
is that if you

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:38.370
look at S5 around this
point-- and this 5,

00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:41.950
when you go to the point,
then S5 will become 0 sides.

00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:42.670
OK?

00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:45.350
So around this point.

00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:50.120
Yeah just in flat
space, around the--

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:52.690
if you write in the
polar coordinates--

00:14:52.690 --> 00:14:55.250
so the sides of this S5
surrounding this point

00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:58.220
become 0 sides when
you go to that point.

00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:00.730
OK?

00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:02.630
Yeah.

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:07.500
But now, if you look
at this metric--

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:11.610
now if you look at
this metric, now

00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:14.765
actually when you
go to the-- when

00:15:14.765 --> 00:15:18.290
you go to the
location of the brane,

00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:21.130
actually, you never
reach i equal to 0.

00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:24.440
Actually, this S5 will now
become a constant side.

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:25.610
OK?

00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:30.240
Also, if you look at this-- so
there are two things happening.

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:31.530
So first this is 1.

00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:33.040
This is 2.

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:40.210
So the first thing is
that S5 direction--

00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:55.760
let me call S5-- now has
a constant radius given

00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:58.470
by this R. So this
is the first thing.

00:15:58.470 --> 00:16:02.970
And the second thing is
that, because of this,

00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:07.457
the R squared-- over
R squared structure--

00:16:07.457 --> 00:16:09.540
say if you write as the
proper distance-- write it

00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:14.414
as a dl squared, so dl will
be the proper distance.

00:16:14.414 --> 00:16:15.830
Then when you solve
this, then you

00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:19.765
find l is essentially log
r, say, plus some constant.

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:27.840
Then as r goes to 0, the l
goes to-- when r goes to 0,

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:29.335
the l goes to minus infinity.

00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:36.890
That means that i
equal to 0-- yeah,

00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:39.200
let me just write it here.

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:47.500
This means i equal
to 0-- see it's

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:49.100
at infinite proper
distance away.

00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:08.710
So for all practical purposes,
the brain has disappeared.

00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:09.550
OK?

00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:13.254
So the geometric
picture is that when

00:17:13.254 --> 00:17:16.200
you include this--
when you include

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:23.349
the gravity of this source, so
now I have to draw something

00:17:23.349 --> 00:17:25.150
called the embedding
diagram just

00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:29.580
to use this extra direction
to show the curvature.

00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:30.950
OK?

00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:35.620
So when you go-- when
you approach this point,

00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:36.770
what do you find?

00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:37.860
You don't find the point.

00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:39.910
Actually, you find there's
an infinite throat.

00:17:43.170 --> 00:17:45.770
And so when you try to
go approach this point,

00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:52.400
and this is the cross section
of this throat, which I can now

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:57.810
draw, is S5 with
the constant radius.

00:17:57.810 --> 00:18:01.580
And then this throat has
an infinite long distance.

00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:03.950
OK?

00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:11.841
So l and here and have
an infinite distance.

00:18:11.841 --> 00:18:12.340
OK?

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:19.380
So that's what's happening here.

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:22.500
And yeah, the sides of
this sphere, of course,

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:34.770
is R, of radius R.

00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:40.040
So in this picture-- so when
you include, what we say,

00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:43.510
the back reaction of the D3
branes, essentially the D3

00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:45.780
branes themselves
have disappeared.

00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:51.430
The only thing left are this
curved geometry and the fluxes.

00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:54.710
Yeah, they're still--
the fluxes won't go away.

00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:57.770
So you will still
see the S5 flux--

00:18:57.770 --> 00:19:01.341
the F5 flux through this S5.

00:19:01.341 --> 00:19:01.840
OK?

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:04.680
So there's still
flux through this S5.

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:13.310
OK?

00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:17.356
Under this metric-- so this is
S5, which completely decoupled

00:19:17.356 --> 00:19:18.480
from the rest of the parts.

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:20.270
So this have a constant radius.

00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:23.030
So this S5 have decoupled
from the rest part.

00:19:23.030 --> 00:19:25.540
So it's natural just
to look at this part.

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:30.380
And this is actually at
AdS5 So let me call it 1.

00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:36.780
So 1 is just AdS5.

00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:38.900
It's the metric of--
5-dimensional anti-de Sitter

00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:42.790
spacetime times an S5.

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:43.640
OK?

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:48.280
And the idea is 5
have the metric.

00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:50.680
So let me just copy here.

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:54.020
Essentially just
this part-- r squared

00:19:54.020 --> 00:20:01.832
R minus dt squared plus
dx squared plus R squared

00:20:01.832 --> 00:20:03.281
r squared dr squared.

00:20:03.281 --> 00:20:03.780
OK?

00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:04.670
So this is the S5.

00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:14.710
So something magic has happened.

00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:17.240
When you try to reach
the brane, then you

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:20.000
find the brain is
no longer there.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.100
And actually develop
an infinite throat.

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:25.876
And this throat, the metric
is given by the S5 times S5.

00:20:25.876 --> 00:20:26.376
OK?

00:20:26.376 --> 00:20:30.260
And of course, at infinity,
you still see a flat space.

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:33.710
And infinity, you still
see a flat Minkowski space.

00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:34.210
OK?

00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:42.680
So now, we have to take a
little bit conceptual leap.

00:20:45.342 --> 00:20:47.550
So now, we have to take a
little bit conceptual leap.

00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:48.360
Yes?

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:51.870
AUDIENCE: So we just basically
bound the most general solution

00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:55.120
of gr with the given
symmetries given by the brane?

00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:56.030
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:20:56.030 --> 00:20:58.620
With-- what do you
mean by most general?

00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:01.150
We have specific D3 branes.

00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:03.230
AUDIENCE: Well, so
we fixed the symmetry

00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:05.777
given by the D3
brane, and then--

00:21:05.777 --> 00:21:08.110
PROFESSOR: No, you also fixed
the D3 brane charge and D3

00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:09.309
brane tension.

00:21:09.309 --> 00:21:09.850
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:11.720
PROFESSOR: That fix everything.

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:12.220
Yeah.

00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:12.720
Yes?

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:14.640
AUDIENCE: So what is the
nature of the source?

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:18.965
Originally, in D3 brane,
it's like electromagnetic--

00:21:18.965 --> 00:21:19.911
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:21:19.911 --> 00:21:22.394
AUDIENCE: --but now
it's like a mass.

00:21:22.394 --> 00:21:23.810
PROFESSOR: No, now
the mass-- even

00:21:23.810 --> 00:21:29.820
the mass is gone, you only
see a curved space time

00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:30.864
and with some fluxes.

00:21:30.864 --> 00:21:32.280
AUDIENCE: But I
mean, [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:39.390
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:41.575
But the mass now
is completely gone.

00:21:41.575 --> 00:21:44.240
It's, in some sense, sitting
at an infinite distance away.

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:45.350
You can never reach it.

00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:48.160
And for all practical purpose,
if you leave this spacetime,

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:50.110
you will never see the source.

00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:52.080
What you will see--
what you will observe

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:55.900
is just a curved spacetime
with some fluxes.

00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:58.870
And this R also,
perfect solution

00:21:58.870 --> 00:22:00.382
of the Einstein equation.

00:22:00.382 --> 00:22:01.840
Yeah, because away
from the source,

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:04.000
it's also perfect solution
of Einstein equations.

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:08.770
Yeah, you have first?

00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:11.020
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so I was
just trying to understand.

00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:14.130
So the point is that-- so is
this somehow protecting us

00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:16.960
from these issues that--
even electromagnetism or even

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:18.900
quantum electromagnetic
field has issues

00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:21.556
of like the divergence, of
kind of going towards a point

00:22:21.556 --> 00:22:21.600
charge?

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:21.670
PROFESSOR: Right, right.

00:22:21.670 --> 00:22:24.390
AUDIENCE: So is this
somehow getting around that

00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:25.677
by making it go far away?

00:22:25.677 --> 00:22:26.260
Or not really?

00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:26.930
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:28.429
No, this is not
getting around that.

00:22:28.429 --> 00:22:32.300
This is-- the solution
presents itself.

00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:34.040
We did not dictate the solution.

00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:36.350
This is pure mathematics.

00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:39.017
And we're just trying to
interpret these mathematics.

00:22:39.017 --> 00:22:41.350
AUDIENCE: But it does achieve
that-- I mean, we didn't--

00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:41.760
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:42.180
Yeah, achieved that.

00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:42.770
Right, right.

00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:44.480
Yeah, just the solution
presented itself.

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:44.892
AUDIENCE: That's crazy.

00:22:44.892 --> 00:22:45.392
OK.

00:22:45.392 --> 00:22:46.130
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:22:46.130 --> 00:22:47.378
Yes?

00:22:47.378 --> 00:22:51.330
AUDIENCE: So all the
electromagnetic charge,

00:22:51.330 --> 00:22:53.306
wouldn't this tear
the space like this,

00:22:53.306 --> 00:22:54.788
but at least [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:54.788 --> 00:22:58.064
What about other [INAUDIBLE]?

00:22:58.064 --> 00:22:58.730
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:22:58.730 --> 00:22:59.251
Yeah.

00:22:59.251 --> 00:23:00.750
Yeah, something
similar will happen,

00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:03.240
but the story is even
more complicated.

00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:06.530
And so the D3 brane,
the metric is simplest.

00:23:06.530 --> 00:23:11.090
Yeah, for reasons that
I will mention later.

00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:12.820
So the reason I choose
D3 brane is just

00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:14.940
because of the-- the
metric is the simplest one.

00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:20.680
Other questions?

00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:23.920
AUDIENCE: So the long-range
Coulmomb potential,

00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:26.220
that's from the
charge of the brane?

00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:27.089
PROFESSOR: Both.

00:23:27.089 --> 00:23:27.630
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:29.550
You can't really
separate them I guess.

00:23:29.550 --> 00:23:30.860
PROFESSOR: Yeah, in
principal, you can separate.

00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:32.040
It'll depend on your probe.

00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:32.540
Yeah.

00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:35.420
But from the metric--
from the metric,

00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:37.550
actually, from the
metric it's just

00:23:37.550 --> 00:23:43.290
from the assumption that
come from the-- from metric,

00:23:43.290 --> 00:23:44.790
of course, you
should just interpret

00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:46.393
that as the gravitational part.

00:23:46.393 --> 00:23:47.976
Yeah, this is just
gravitational part.

00:23:47.976 --> 00:23:49.142
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:23:49.142 --> 00:23:54.050
So there, you'll draw the flux
as flowing out of the cylinder

00:23:54.050 --> 00:23:55.110
or along the cylinder?

00:23:55.110 --> 00:23:56.265
I guess it's along the cylinder.

00:23:56.265 --> 00:23:56.660
PROFESSOR: No, no.

00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:57.460
Not along the cylinder.

00:23:57.460 --> 00:23:59.043
Along the cylinder
is the r direction.

00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:04.000
The flux is in the S5.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.780
Just think of a hollow S2.

00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:09.720
Think of a hollow square.

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:11.750
Think of a hollow S2.

00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:14.057
Then S2 you can
have magnetic flux.

00:24:14.057 --> 00:24:14.640
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:17.940
And the flux is all over
the radial direction.

00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:20.260
PROFESSOR: And then there's
no radial direction.

00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:23.010
If you only have S2, then
there's no radial direction.

00:24:23.010 --> 00:24:23.990
Just only have S2.

00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:24.900
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:27.690
PROFESSOR: And then you
can have a flux on that S2.

00:24:27.690 --> 00:24:28.714
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:24:28.714 --> 00:24:29.380
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:31.520
Something proportional
to F theta phi,

00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:33.070
say in the natural magnetism.

00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:37.062
Yeah, so this would be a
magnetic flux in the-- yeah.

00:24:41.290 --> 00:24:42.110
AUDIENCE: Oh, yes.

00:24:42.110 --> 00:24:45.390
But you write it like in R6.

00:24:45.390 --> 00:24:50.304
If you write it in R6, it is
along the radius direction.

00:24:50.304 --> 00:24:50.970
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:24:50.970 --> 00:24:57.200
Just forget about the--
in this picture it's back

00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:58.910
in the radial direction.

00:24:58.910 --> 00:25:00.810
But once we're in this
picture, and then this

00:25:00.810 --> 00:25:01.934
becomes completely coupled.

00:25:01.934 --> 00:25:02.780
AUDIENCE: Oh, oh.

00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:03.490
I see.

00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:06.145
PROFESSOR: And then you
just have separate S5.

00:25:06.145 --> 00:25:07.061
AUDIENCE: I see, yeah.

00:25:07.061 --> 00:25:07.977
PROFESSOR: Yeah, yeah.

00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:12.710
OK.

00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:15.800
So now, we have to do a
little bit conceptual leap.

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:17.540
It's not too big.

00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:33.790
It's that now we have
two of the three braes.

00:25:37.336 --> 00:25:39.210
OK?

00:25:39.210 --> 00:25:44.950
So in the description one,
you just have a D brane.

00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:49.200
You really just have some
Dirichlet boundary conditions

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:56.500
in flat Minkowski
10-dimensional spacetime,

00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:58.520
and where open strings can end.

00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:00.950
Where open strings leave, say.

00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:13.430
So in this picture, you
just-- you specify some plane,

00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:18.200
some surface in the
Minkowski 10-dimension.

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:22.110
And so this is R3.

00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:24.990
Say 01, 3 if you include
the time direction.

00:26:24.990 --> 00:26:29.450
So you just specify some
plane in the spacetime,

00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:33.290
in the 10-dimensional
spacetime where, on this plane,

00:26:33.290 --> 00:26:39.070
you can have open
string citations, OK?

00:26:39.070 --> 00:26:44.372
And then the system, of course,
can also have closed strings.

00:26:44.372 --> 00:26:45.830
Then this close
string can interact

00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:48.260
with the brane, can interact
with the open strings,

00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:49.280
et cetera.

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:54.870
And the only-- so everything
is in the flat space.

00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:57.280
Everything is in the flat space.

00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:59.952
And you have open string, you
have close string, open string.

00:26:59.952 --> 00:27:01.410
Even on the brane,
the close string

00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:03.451
can interact with the
brane, can-- a close string

00:27:03.451 --> 00:27:04.910
can interact with open string.

00:27:04.910 --> 00:27:07.700
In particular, for example,
you can send the close string

00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:10.720
and absorb by the brane, and
then decay into open string.

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:12.470
It's possible.

00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:15.230
So this just goes
one into say, yeah.

00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:18.010
Or you can have two
open strings collide,

00:27:18.010 --> 00:27:20.510
then become a closed string,
and then jump out of the brane.

00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:23.400
Yeah, you can have all kinds
of this kind of interaction.

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:27.540
The key point is that in this
description, the only thing

00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:33.790
you did is Dirichlet
boundary conditions

00:27:33.790 --> 00:27:41.940
specified on some component
your worksheet fields,

00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:43.070
for the string.

00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:45.120
OK?

00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:47.830
So this is-- but
now, from here, we

00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:52.500
have also found the
different, second description.

00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:54.170
Inside, we have
spacetime metric.

00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:03.970
One which is some
curved spacetime,

00:28:03.970 --> 00:28:09.465
them plus F5 flux on s5.

00:28:12.790 --> 00:28:14.150
OK?

00:28:14.150 --> 00:28:15.935
So here, there's no
D branes anymore.

00:28:15.935 --> 00:28:19.340
We just have some curved
spacetime with some fluxes.

00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:21.990
So here, the only thing
leaves is a closed string.

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:31.625
So only closed strings.

00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:40.010
But those closed strings
see a curved geometry.

00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:40.510
OK?

00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:43.880
So now I can include
all dimensions.

00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:46.970
To contrast these two, let
me draw this picture again.

00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:49.780
Now let's draw a
10-dimensional picture.

00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:54.280
So this is R, Minkowski 10.

00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:56.940
So this is Minkowski 10.

00:28:56.940 --> 00:29:02.280
So when you now go to
smaller radius r, and then

00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:06.530
you develop an infinite throat--
so this becomes AdS 5 times s5.

00:29:10.545 --> 00:29:11.970
OK?

00:29:11.970 --> 00:29:14.610
5 down the throat.

00:29:14.610 --> 00:29:19.800
And here, only closed
string can propagate.

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:23.430
There's no D brane, but the
closed string at infinity

00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:26.930
in Ads5, so you can
have closed strings.

00:29:26.930 --> 00:29:27.430
OK?

00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:32.460
So is this clear?

00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:34.212
AUDIENCE: What would
have closed strings?

00:29:34.212 --> 00:29:36.850
Because in low energy
cases, no strings

00:29:36.850 --> 00:29:41.350
would only have effective field.

00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:43.445
PROFESSOR: But you have-- yeah.

00:29:43.445 --> 00:29:45.780
But this is a geometry.

00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:47.010
This provides the geometry.

00:29:47.010 --> 00:29:50.010
In principle, the expectations
would be closed string.

00:29:50.010 --> 00:29:53.332
Now you can do string
theory in this geometry.

00:29:53.332 --> 00:29:53.873
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:29:53.873 --> 00:29:55.239
Oh, I see.

00:29:55.239 --> 00:29:56.530
PROFESSOR: So now essentially--

00:29:56.530 --> 00:29:58.160
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
as a target.

00:29:58.160 --> 00:29:58.959
New targets space--

00:29:58.959 --> 00:29:59.750
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:29:59.750 --> 00:30:02.410
AUDIENCE: Oh, and do
new string theory--

00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:03.350
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:05.610
So we started with a D brane.

00:30:05.610 --> 00:30:09.610
And then we solved the geometry
due to the D branes-- geometry

00:30:09.610 --> 00:30:11.320
due to that D branes.

00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:14.160
And then now you can
quantize the string theory

00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:16.040
in that new geometry.

00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:17.800
Then that will
describe how things

00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:18.940
interact with the D brane.

00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:20.070
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:20.910
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:30:20.910 --> 00:30:22.910
But in this picture,
there's no D brane anymore.

00:30:22.910 --> 00:30:26.370
There's only closed strings.

00:30:26.370 --> 00:30:27.890
OK?

00:30:27.890 --> 00:30:31.380
So we just have-- yeah.

00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:31.880
Good?

00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:33.545
Yes?

00:30:33.545 --> 00:30:34.044
Hm?

00:30:34.044 --> 00:30:35.870
AUDIENCE: What was F5?

00:30:35.870 --> 00:30:41.160
PROFESSOR: F5, it's this F5 form
of the type IIB string, which

00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:43.120
this D3 brane carry the charge.

00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:45.290
So this generalized charge
I discussed last time.

00:30:48.330 --> 00:30:50.518
Other questions?

00:30:50.518 --> 00:30:53.950
AUDIENCE: But in
last class, we know

00:30:53.950 --> 00:30:59.324
the F5 is from the
effective theory.

00:30:59.324 --> 00:31:00.240
PROFESSOR: Yeah, yeah.

00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:00.865
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:31:00.865 --> 00:31:04.387
And the effective theory is
from the open string spectrum.

00:31:04.387 --> 00:31:04.970
PROFESSOR: No.

00:31:04.970 --> 00:31:05.710
No, no.

00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:07.400
F5 is close string spectrum.

00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:09.360
AUDIENCE: Oh, it's
closed string spectrum.

00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:13.413
So why can't we apply
string theory twice?

00:31:13.413 --> 00:31:15.274
The first time we get a flux.

00:31:15.274 --> 00:31:15.940
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:18.330
AUDIENCE: And then we get
to modify the targets with--

00:31:18.330 --> 00:31:20.570
PROFESSOR: Yeah, right.

00:31:20.570 --> 00:31:21.540
Yeah.

00:31:21.540 --> 00:31:23.180
Yeah, you can.

00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:24.550
Yeah.

00:31:24.550 --> 00:31:29.510
String theory, you can work
with any field of spacetime.

00:31:29.510 --> 00:31:31.220
You can think about
propagating a string

00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:34.034
in the generic closed spacetime.

00:31:34.034 --> 00:31:34.575
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:43.340
Because it seems like the second
application of string theory

00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:45.820
is like a higher
order correction.

00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:46.650
PROFESSOR: No.

00:31:46.650 --> 00:31:50.440
No this picture-- this picture,
I'm just looking at-- forgot

00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:51.190
about D branes.

00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:53.590
I just look at
some charge object.

00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:56.050
I look at some charge
object in string theory.

00:31:56.050 --> 00:31:58.200
And that object have some
charge, have some mass.

00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:00.130
Then I will call this metric.

00:32:00.130 --> 00:32:01.520
I will call this metric.

00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:04.840
And the string must be
able to live in that-- must

00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:06.510
be able to live in that metric.

00:32:06.510 --> 00:32:09.480
And if I want to work out
the property of the string,

00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:14.750
then the metric-- I quantize
the string in this geometry.

00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:15.990
And quantum string geometry.

00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:18.740
So this point, if you were just
purely to view the D3 brane

00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:23.360
as some charged object
in the string theory.

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:26.530
You just solve this geometry.

00:32:26.530 --> 00:32:27.620
OK?

00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:28.730
Any other questions?

00:32:28.730 --> 00:32:31.200
So this is a very
important point.

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:33.580
It's a very important point.

00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:46.070
So now, the key is that
consistency A must equal to B.

00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:49.404
So these two descriptions
must be equivalent.

00:32:49.404 --> 00:32:50.840
OK?

00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:54.250
So this can be generalization
as the simple exercise

00:32:54.250 --> 00:32:56.550
we described earlier.

00:32:56.550 --> 00:32:59.890
That if you want to describe the
interaction between the two D

00:32:59.890 --> 00:33:06.320
branes, you can do it
in two equivalent way.

00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:10.050
One is to consider some loops
of open strings, which only need

00:33:10.050 --> 00:33:11.880
to consider the flat space.

00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:14.370
Just consider loops
of open strings.

00:33:14.370 --> 00:33:18.770
Or you can see that the graviton
exchange between the two D

00:33:18.770 --> 00:33:19.480
branes.

00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:21.680
And the graviton exchange
between the two D brane

00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:25.920
is to view that the other
D brane have already

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:28.425
curved your spacetime and
that the other D brane live

00:33:28.425 --> 00:33:30.010
in that curved spacetime.

00:33:30.010 --> 00:33:31.855
So this are a precise
generalization

00:33:31.855 --> 00:33:33.640
of that equivalent.

00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:34.140
OK?

00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:45.670
Now we have two
descriptions of the D branes

00:33:45.670 --> 00:33:48.960
which are completely
different-- this one involving

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:51.102
flash space and open
and closed strings,

00:33:51.102 --> 00:33:52.810
and this one only
involving closed string

00:33:52.810 --> 00:33:54.050
but in some curved spacetime.

00:33:54.050 --> 00:33:56.450
OK?

00:33:56.450 --> 00:34:08.040
And in principle,
both descriptions

00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:24.330
can in principle be valid for
all value of alpha prime and g

00:34:24.330 --> 00:34:26.271
string.

00:34:26.271 --> 00:34:26.770
OK?

00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:32.360
So the two parameters
in the string theory

00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:35.230
is alpha prime and--
by all alpha prime,

00:34:35.230 --> 00:34:38.080
just consider for all energies.

00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:39.961
Yeah.

00:34:39.961 --> 00:34:40.460
OK?

00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:44.632
AUDIENCE: Why?

00:34:44.632 --> 00:34:45.000
PROFESSOR: Hm?

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.739
AUDIENCE: It seems like
they're constrained, no?

00:34:46.739 --> 00:34:47.139
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:34:47.139 --> 00:34:47.850
Yeah.

00:34:47.850 --> 00:34:50.389
So first, in this
picture, there's

00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:55.070
no restriction what is the
alpha prime or g string.

00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:57.890
And you just impose the
Dirichlet boundary condition.

00:34:57.890 --> 00:34:59.494
And when you have a
g string, you just

00:34:59.494 --> 00:35:02.830
need to include the higher
loop diagrams, et cetera.

00:35:02.830 --> 00:35:08.430
So when we work
out this geometry,

00:35:08.430 --> 00:35:11.830
so this statement is
more try to apply to b.

00:35:11.830 --> 00:35:20.150
In b, when we work out this
geometry, and also that AdS5,

00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:23.410
we were working using
the approximation

00:35:23.410 --> 00:35:26.536
that the alpha prime
should be small

00:35:26.536 --> 00:35:27.910
and the g string
should be small.

00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:28.902
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:35:28.902 --> 00:35:30.560
PROFESSOR: But once
we have worked out

00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:33.855
that solution in these
regime, in principle,

00:35:33.855 --> 00:35:36.440
if you're technically
powerful enough, you

00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:40.215
should be able to extend this
to general values of g string

00:35:40.215 --> 00:35:41.740
and alpha prime.

00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:44.330
It may not be
precisely this metric,

00:35:44.330 --> 00:35:45.830
but with some kind
of formation of

00:35:45.830 --> 00:35:47.710
that from other
prime corrections

00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:49.020
and g string corrections.

00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:52.500
But you should be
able to do that.

00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:53.040
Yeah.

00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:56.160
Yeah, so that's why
I said in principle.

00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:57.120
AUDIENCE: Got it.

00:35:57.120 --> 00:35:58.860
PROFESSOR: OK?

00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:01.280
So we must have these
two descriptions.

00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:04.460
And these can be valid for all
range of the parameters you

00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:06.950
can be interested in.

00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:07.450
OK?

00:36:10.050 --> 00:36:13.910
And so this is a very surprising
statement, this A equal to B.

00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:17.150
But there's not
much to do about it,

00:36:17.150 --> 00:36:19.909
because of this is
a complicated thing.

00:36:19.909 --> 00:36:21.450
And this is also a
complicated thing.

00:36:21.450 --> 00:36:23.560
This is even more complicated,
doing string theory

00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:25.060
on some curved spacetime.

00:36:25.060 --> 00:36:27.510
In particular--
say if you consider

00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:30.040
g string is a very
small, et cetera, then

00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:31.522
maybe you can do something.

00:36:31.522 --> 00:36:32.980
But then it's not
that interesting,

00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:34.938
because on both sides,
you do some perturbation

00:36:34.938 --> 00:36:36.470
theory, et cetera.

00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:36.970
Anyway.

00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:55.190
But the remarkable thing--
which Maldacena realized in 1997

00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:58.274
is that you can actually take
a limit of this statement.

00:36:58.274 --> 00:37:01.100
And when you take a
limit of this statement,

00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:03.670
then the statement
becomes very interesting.

00:37:03.670 --> 00:37:05.740
Then you can actually do a lot.

00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:06.910
OK?

00:37:06.910 --> 00:37:11.170
And the limit is the
low energy limit.

00:37:11.170 --> 00:37:15.030
So if you consider
the low energy limit,

00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:19.706
then you derive what
is now called AdS/CFT.

00:37:19.706 --> 00:37:22.800
We will now explain
how to do that.

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:23.502
Yes?

00:37:23.502 --> 00:37:25.960
AUDIENCE: It seems like this
correspondence between A and B

00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:27.480
only exists in the
low energy limit.

00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:31.153
Because here, the closed
string is traveling

00:37:31.153 --> 00:37:32.250
in the base spacetime.

00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:34.850
That spacetime is only
the low energy corrections

00:37:34.850 --> 00:37:38.755
from the D brane, not
the higher corrections.

00:37:38.755 --> 00:37:42.990
Because we only solved the
low energy effective theory.

00:37:42.990 --> 00:37:46.070
PROFESSOR: No, that's--
this is a good question,

00:37:46.070 --> 00:37:50.110
but that's what I was
trying to say earlier.

00:37:50.110 --> 00:37:58.110
So we find this metric by
working in this regime.

00:37:58.110 --> 00:38:01.190
But now if I want to go
away from this regime--

00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:03.870
if I want to go away
from this regime,

00:38:03.870 --> 00:38:08.385
then if I want to go
away from this regime,

00:38:08.385 --> 00:38:10.760
then I have to take into
account other prime corrections,

00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:11.820
et cetera.

00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:13.590
And this is a
complicated process.

00:38:13.590 --> 00:38:15.830
But in principle, I can do that.

00:38:15.830 --> 00:38:18.530
In principle, I can do that.

00:38:18.530 --> 00:38:20.740
So that geometry may get
modified, the schedule.

00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:22.085
But, in principle, I can do.

00:38:30.661 --> 00:38:32.160
So now it turns
out, if you consider

00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:34.180
lower energy limit
of this A equal to B,

00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:37.040
then you can actually derive
a very powerful statement.

00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:38.400
OK?

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:41.100
AUDIENCE: Is this actually
the lower energy limit?

00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:44.520
PROFESSOR: No, this itself
is not low energy limit.

00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:46.822
This is a classical
gravity limit.

00:38:46.822 --> 00:38:48.207
AUDIENCE: What's the difference?

00:38:48.207 --> 00:38:48.790
PROFESSOR: Hm?

00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:49.890
AUDIENCE: What's the difference?

00:38:49.890 --> 00:38:51.290
PROFESSOR: I will explain that.

00:38:51.290 --> 00:38:53.183
No, this is the
classical gravity limit.

00:38:53.183 --> 00:38:53.910
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:38:53.910 --> 00:38:55.743
PROFESSOR: And at least
the low energy limit

00:38:55.743 --> 00:38:58.730
does not involve this.

00:38:58.730 --> 00:39:00.730
Yeah, I will explain what
this low energy limit.

00:39:00.730 --> 00:39:01.747
Yeah.

00:39:01.747 --> 00:39:02.580
Any other questions?

00:39:05.661 --> 00:39:06.160
Good?

00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:07.120
OK.

00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:08.703
So now let's look
at low energy limit.

00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:26.180
In particular, here, I
don't do any restriction

00:39:26.180 --> 00:39:27.060
on the g string.

00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:29.420
So g string can, in
principle, be strong here.

00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:32.660
I don't impose any constraint
on the string happening now.

00:39:32.660 --> 00:39:34.010
I only consider low energy.

00:39:34.010 --> 00:39:35.960
OK?

00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:38.330
So low energy
limit-- because when

00:39:38.330 --> 00:39:45.360
I fix the energy,
E-- some process

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:49.020
I'm interested in, some typical
energy I'm interested in.

00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:54.140
Then I want to take the
alpha prime go to 0 limit.

00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:55.420
OK?

00:39:55.420 --> 00:40:00.570
Or you fix-- equivalent,
you can fix alpha prime.

00:40:00.570 --> 00:40:02.320
Then you take E equal to 0.

00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:03.080
OK?

00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:05.810
Because only the dimension
is product of the matters.

00:40:05.810 --> 00:40:07.850
And I can describe either way.

00:40:07.850 --> 00:40:09.080
OK?

00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:13.190
So physicality, what is more
convenient-- mathematically,

00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:15.870
normally what is more convenient
is that we think we fix E,

00:40:15.870 --> 00:40:17.130
and then take alpha
prime goes to 0.

00:40:17.130 --> 00:40:18.338
But you can think either way.

00:40:18.338 --> 00:40:18.999
OK?

00:40:18.999 --> 00:40:20.790
So the low energy limit
is essentially just

00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:26.110
the limit of alpha prime
times e squared goes to 0.

00:40:26.110 --> 00:40:27.440
That's the dimension statement.

00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:27.940
OK?

00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:30.240
So this is the low energy limit.

00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:33.790
I only consider those
physical process with E

00:40:33.790 --> 00:40:36.610
that would satisfy this region.

00:40:36.610 --> 00:40:37.110
OK?

00:40:39.690 --> 00:40:41.650
Good?

00:40:41.650 --> 00:40:46.730
And I'm doing no
restriction on the gs.

00:40:46.730 --> 00:40:49.835
So now, let's consider A. What
is the low energy limit for A?

00:40:53.410 --> 00:40:57.340
For A, we know-- so A,
we have two factors.

00:40:57.340 --> 00:40:59.940
We have open string factor,
which is live on the D brane.

00:40:59.940 --> 00:41:01.980
Then we also have
close string factor.

00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:03.840
OK?

00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:05.600
Which live outside the brane.

00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:13.600
For the open string
factor, we just recover.

00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:15.850
So we discussed
before-- on the D brane,

00:41:15.850 --> 00:41:18.930
when you go to low
energy, what do you get?

00:41:22.115 --> 00:41:23.240
AUDIENCE: Super Yang-Mills?

00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:24.190
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:41:24.190 --> 00:41:26.360
You just recover
your Mills series.

00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:28.470
It just recover super
Yang-Mills series.

00:41:28.470 --> 00:41:32.610
And in this case-- let me give
a special name for the D3 brane.

00:41:32.610 --> 00:41:36.390
It turns out you get to the
n equals 4 super Yang-Mills.

00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:38.526
Just the specific
super Yang-Mills theory

00:41:38.526 --> 00:41:40.460
in four dimension.

00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:44.070
And then we sketch group un.

00:41:44.070 --> 00:41:44.570
OK?

00:41:44.570 --> 00:41:45.890
Because we have D branes.

00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:52.020
And in particular,
as we said before,

00:41:52.020 --> 00:41:59.100
the Yang-Mills coupling
is related to the gs.

00:41:59.100 --> 00:41:59.780
OK?

00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:02.250
It's proportional to the gs.

00:42:02.250 --> 00:42:07.100
And so the D3 brane give rise
to a 3 plus 1 dimensional

00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:08.192
field theory.

00:42:08.192 --> 00:42:09.900
In the 3 plus 1
dimensional field theory,

00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:12.810
the Yang-Mills company
is dimensionless.

00:42:12.810 --> 00:42:15.410
So there's no other
dimensional parameter here.

00:42:15.410 --> 00:42:20.200
So there's only-- so there's
only numerical factor, 4 pi,

00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:23.270
which you can work out
by explicit calculations.

00:42:23.270 --> 00:42:27.270
So this is key, because
if there's a scale here,

00:42:27.270 --> 00:42:30.290
then the story is more
complicated, because you

00:42:30.290 --> 00:42:32.750
have to take alpha
goes to 0, et cetera.

00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:33.250
OK?

00:42:33.250 --> 00:42:35.460
So the key is that this is
a dimensionless coupling.

00:42:35.460 --> 00:42:38.470
So they have a simple relation.

00:42:38.470 --> 00:42:41.600
So in open string, when
you take low energy limit,

00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:44.870
you just get a Yang-Mills
series and some finite coupling.

00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:45.900
OK?

00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:49.720
Which is determined by the
string coupling constant.

00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:52.235
But in this series, there's
also closed string factor.

00:42:56.880 --> 00:43:05.065
In a closed string
factor, again,

00:43:05.065 --> 00:43:06.440
when you take a
low energy limit,

00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:08.790
you get the massless modes.

00:43:08.790 --> 00:43:16.700
You get graviton,
dilaton, et cetera.

00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:17.940
But only massless modes.

00:43:17.940 --> 00:43:18.440
OK?

00:43:24.574 --> 00:43:26.240
But now, there's a
very important point.

00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:34.310
The carpeting between the
closed and open string

00:43:34.310 --> 00:43:36.830
are mediated through
gravitational effect.

00:43:36.830 --> 00:43:38.310
OK?

00:43:38.310 --> 00:43:45.690
So the coupling
between the massless--

00:43:45.690 --> 00:43:47.140
so only massless modes are left.

00:43:47.140 --> 00:43:52.810
So the coupling between the
massless closed and open

00:43:52.810 --> 00:44:15.040
string, or closed
string themselves, those

00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:22.920
interactions just-- it's
always controlled by G Newton.

00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:25.410
This we know, because this
is a low energy limit.

00:44:25.410 --> 00:44:27.860
Graviton, it's
controlled by G Newton.

00:44:27.860 --> 00:44:30.330
It's gravitational by
gravitational interactions.

00:44:30.330 --> 00:44:35.620
Another key is that g newton,
in contrast to this Yang-Mills

00:44:35.620 --> 00:44:37.420
coupling, which
is dimensionless,

00:44:37.420 --> 00:44:40.250
G Newton is dimensional.

00:44:40.250 --> 00:44:43.810
And the g newton is
proportional to gs squared

00:44:43.810 --> 00:44:48.200
alpha prime to the power of 4.

00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:54.390
So that means, in
the low energy limit,

00:44:54.390 --> 00:44:57.100
then the dimension
is coupling-- then

00:44:57.100 --> 00:45:01.630
the dimensionless parameter
is g to the power, say, 8.

00:45:01.630 --> 00:45:03.430
Because this have dimension 8.

00:45:03.430 --> 00:45:07.040
So these is dimension--
this one goes to 0.

00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:09.100
OK?

00:45:09.100 --> 00:45:14.110
So that actually tells
you, in a low energy limit,

00:45:14.110 --> 00:45:17.130
the interaction between open
and closed string will decouple.

00:45:17.130 --> 00:45:18.240
OK?

00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:21.020
This is our familiar fact.

00:45:21.020 --> 00:45:23.240
That electron-- when
we talk about electron,

00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:26.090
you don't have to
talk about gravity.

00:45:26.090 --> 00:45:29.000
Because their energy is so
low, their gravity is so weak.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:29.610
OK?

00:45:29.610 --> 00:45:32.450
And the gravity only become
strong if their energy become

00:45:32.450 --> 00:45:33.140
big.

00:45:33.140 --> 00:45:34.600
OK?

00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:36.640
It's just because of this.

00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:39.370
In 3 plus 1, we just
GN times E squared.

00:45:39.370 --> 00:45:42.120
But here we are in 10
dimensions, E to the power 8

00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:44.610
doesn't matter.

00:45:44.610 --> 00:45:53.520
So now that means, in the E
goes to 0 limit, what we find

00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:56.070
is we find that interacting
n equals 4 super Yang-Mills

00:45:56.070 --> 00:46:06.770
theory plus three gravitons
plus other massless modes.

00:46:06.770 --> 00:46:10.320
But they all become free,
because the interaction

00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:11.960
essentially switches off.

00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:14.319
Any interaction in this
factor, they switch off.

00:46:14.319 --> 00:46:15.860
In particular,
there's no interaction

00:46:15.860 --> 00:46:18.480
between these two factors.

00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:21.420
OK?

00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:24.650
So this is what we
get on the A picture.

00:46:29.070 --> 00:46:32.500
AUDIENCE: So the top really
is actually G Newton E8.

00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:33.212
Times E8.

00:46:33.212 --> 00:46:34.670
PROFESSOR: No, I'm
just saying this

00:46:34.670 --> 00:46:37.246
is a dimensionless
combination of them.

00:46:37.246 --> 00:46:39.374
AUDIENCE: It's the
actual coupling?

00:46:39.374 --> 00:46:41.290
PROFESSOR: No, the actual
coupling can be 1/2.

00:46:41.290 --> 00:46:42.390
It can be square root of these.

00:46:42.390 --> 00:46:43.360
Controlled by the G Newton.

00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:45.370
And the key thing, it's
controlled by G Newton.

00:46:45.370 --> 00:46:50.200
And G Newton is a
dimensional parameter.

00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:51.320
That's just the key.

00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:51.910
Yes?

00:46:51.910 --> 00:46:54.076
AUDIENCE: Why can't they
direct through gauge boson?

00:46:55.856 --> 00:46:57.730
PROFESSOR: No the gauge
gauge bosons interact

00:46:57.730 --> 00:46:58.467
with themselves.

00:46:58.467 --> 00:47:00.550
The interaction with the
gauge boson with graviton

00:47:00.550 --> 00:47:02.350
is gravitational.

00:47:02.350 --> 00:47:03.580
Have to go through G Newton.

00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:10.590
The gauge boson will
interact with themselves.

00:47:10.590 --> 00:47:13.890
It's captured by here.

00:47:13.890 --> 00:47:17.800
So anything involving gravity,
involve dimensional couplings,

00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:20.740
then they will switch off
in the low energy limit.

00:47:20.740 --> 00:47:25.010
Just like we don't have to
worry about the gravitational

00:47:25.010 --> 00:47:30.985
interaction of an electron when
we talk about hydrogen atom.

00:47:30.985 --> 00:47:32.965
AUDIENCE: But we know
that from [INAUDIBLE],

00:47:32.965 --> 00:47:34.950
but how do we see
from here that--

00:47:34.950 --> 00:47:36.550
PROFESSOR: No, no.

00:47:36.550 --> 00:47:39.510
It's just from here.

00:47:39.510 --> 00:47:41.990
This is just the same.

00:47:41.990 --> 00:47:43.420
You can calculate it carefully.

00:47:43.420 --> 00:47:46.420
You can calculate-- you can
calculate it precisely, work

00:47:46.420 --> 00:47:49.040
out the sketching amplitude
between the photon

00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:50.895
and the graviton, take
the low energy limit,

00:47:50.895 --> 00:47:55.180
and you find that
sketching goes to 0.

00:47:55.180 --> 00:47:58.120
You can do that calculation
explicitly and take the limit.

00:47:58.120 --> 00:47:59.870
But this argument tells
you that you don't

00:47:59.870 --> 00:48:01.120
have to do the calculation.

00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:02.000
It will always work.

00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:09.530
OK.

00:48:09.530 --> 00:48:12.810
So now let's look
at Picture B, when

00:48:12.810 --> 00:48:14.910
we take the low energy limit.

00:48:14.910 --> 00:48:18.368
And now let's go
back to this metric.

00:48:18.368 --> 00:48:21.020
Now let's go back
to this metric.

00:48:21.020 --> 00:48:24.330
Actually, it's handy.

00:48:24.330 --> 00:48:27.787
So now, let's look at picture
B, the low energy limit.

00:48:27.787 --> 00:48:28.870
Let's look at this metric.

00:48:35.830 --> 00:48:39.220
So this is a curved space time.

00:48:39.220 --> 00:48:42.960
So when we take low energy
limit, we have to be careful.

00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:45.930
Because one important
thing you always

00:48:45.930 --> 00:48:48.450
keep in mind when you
have a curve of spacetime,

00:48:48.450 --> 00:48:50.760
the time depends
on where you sit.

00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:53.940
You have to always
specify a reference time.

00:48:53.940 --> 00:48:56.101
Because time is no longer
the absolute thing.

00:48:56.101 --> 00:48:56.600
OK?

00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:58.710
Because at the local
time, et cetera,

00:48:58.710 --> 00:49:00.380
you have to specify
your time frame.

00:49:00.380 --> 00:49:02.480
OK?

00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:05.850
And so we have to
ask what is this E?

00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:14.490
In picture A, translate
into this picture.

00:49:14.490 --> 00:49:19.910
In Picture A, everything
is in Minkowski spacetime.

00:49:19.910 --> 00:49:27.380
And that E is essentially E
for the Minkowski spacetime

00:49:27.380 --> 00:49:30.430
at the infinity in
the picture B. OK?

00:49:30.430 --> 00:49:35.420
So in other words, the
E-- in other words--

00:49:35.420 --> 00:49:42.510
so here, let me just say
the curve of spacetime

00:49:42.510 --> 00:49:54.114
must be careful to
specify what energy we

00:49:54.114 --> 00:49:56.280
are interested in, what
energy we are talking about.

00:50:01.404 --> 00:50:03.380
OK?

00:50:03.380 --> 00:50:07.235
So the energy depends on
now your choice of time,

00:50:07.235 --> 00:50:09.070
or it depends on your observer.

00:50:09.070 --> 00:50:09.570
OK?

00:50:15.430 --> 00:50:18.310
But in order to
compare a with b,

00:50:18.310 --> 00:50:30.860
we have to translate what is
E in A. This translated into B

00:50:30.860 --> 00:50:41.840
is defined with respect
to the t-- this t there.

00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:43.530
OK?

00:50:43.530 --> 00:50:49.602
In other words, it's the
time at i equal to infinity.

00:50:49.602 --> 00:50:50.101
OK?

00:50:52.910 --> 00:50:57.410
So that energy scale is
defined to that specific time.

00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:11.530
But now, when we talk
about the physics happening

00:51:11.530 --> 00:51:13.940
in this spacetime--
for example, we're

00:51:13.940 --> 00:51:15.740
talking about the
string theory string g

00:51:15.740 --> 00:51:20.130
excitations of the mass
of the string, et cetera,

00:51:20.130 --> 00:51:22.980
you have to refer to
the local proper time

00:51:22.980 --> 00:51:27.790
at whatever place-- at
whatever place you are talking

00:51:27.790 --> 00:51:30.270
about your physical process.

00:51:30.270 --> 00:51:32.060
OK?

00:51:32.060 --> 00:51:47.710
So that means-- oh, actually
today we are going to 6:30.

00:51:47.710 --> 00:51:48.449
Yeah, right.

00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:57.260
So suppose you are
at some location, r.

00:51:57.260 --> 00:52:04.210
Then the local proper
time, which I will call

00:52:04.210 --> 00:52:11.880
tau-- the local
proper time, the tau,

00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:17.637
then it's related to the time
at infinity by this factor.

00:52:17.637 --> 00:52:20.380
OK?

00:52:20.380 --> 00:52:21.970
By the factor.

00:52:21.970 --> 00:52:26.130
This-- the local observed
equals this, the tau squared.

00:52:26.130 --> 00:52:30.240
So they're related to
this by this factor.

00:52:32.910 --> 00:52:37.830
So now you can easily convert--
then the local proper energy

00:52:37.830 --> 00:52:40.696
is related to the energy
we are talking about here,

00:52:40.696 --> 00:52:45.396
by H to a power of 1/4 E. OK?

00:52:48.820 --> 00:52:50.150
OK?

00:52:50.150 --> 00:52:52.980
So now, it's very important,
when we take the low energy

00:52:52.980 --> 00:52:56.970
limit, we take this E small.

00:52:56.970 --> 00:52:59.500
But due to the gravitational
redshift effect,

00:52:59.500 --> 00:53:02.080
this E tau does not
have to be small.

00:53:02.080 --> 00:53:02.680
OK?

00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:06.690
And so this is the thing
will be important here.

00:53:06.690 --> 00:53:12.640
So when r is much,
much greater than r--

00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:23.360
so when we are sitting
around here, then H is 1.

00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:24.760
OK?

00:53:24.760 --> 00:53:28.040
Then the limit E
square alpha prime

00:53:28.040 --> 00:53:33.320
goes to 0 really just tells
you that all massive closed

00:53:33.320 --> 00:53:34.280
string decouple.

00:53:50.290 --> 00:53:52.446
All massive closed
string decouple.

00:53:52.446 --> 00:53:54.300
OK?

00:53:54.300 --> 00:53:58.330
In particular, though,
the interaction among

00:53:58.330 --> 00:53:59.900
closed string themselves.

00:53:59.900 --> 00:54:02.300
By the same argument, they
also become weaker and weaker

00:54:02.300 --> 00:54:03.640
when you go to low energy limit.

00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:07.140
So essentially, again,
they become free gravitons.

00:54:07.140 --> 00:54:07.640
OK?

00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:18.361
But now let's look at the
other regime and r around here.

00:54:18.361 --> 00:54:18.860
OK?

00:54:22.490 --> 00:54:26.170
So this is for that.

00:54:26.170 --> 00:54:31.130
But now, let's consider r
smaller than R, capital R.

00:54:31.130 --> 00:54:35.835
And then, in this regime,
we go to this AdS5 times S5.

00:54:35.835 --> 00:54:39.980
Then H becomes R to
the power of 4, r4.

00:54:39.980 --> 00:54:45.590
And now this statement, and
the E squared, alpha prime,

00:54:45.590 --> 00:54:48.620
go to 0, translates.

00:54:48.620 --> 00:54:51.060
Now you have a redshift factor.

00:54:51.060 --> 00:54:53.005
And tau squared.
if I translate it

00:54:53.005 --> 00:54:55.490
in tau, the local energy scale.

00:55:16.250 --> 00:55:18.720
In particular,
now, let's remember

00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:22.120
this r4 is given by that.

00:55:22.120 --> 00:55:28.630
So this can be
written e tau squared

00:55:28.630 --> 00:55:34.295
r squared 4 pi gsN goes to 0.

00:55:37.690 --> 00:55:41.100
So now, important
thing happened.

00:55:41.100 --> 00:55:43.011
Important thing just happened.

00:55:43.011 --> 00:55:45.010
Then you find this alpha
prime actually canceled

00:55:45.010 --> 00:55:46.170
with each other.

00:55:46.170 --> 00:55:50.370
Alpha prime here and alpha prime
there, they cancel each other.

00:55:50.370 --> 00:55:53.900
And here, there's nothing
in alpha prime left.

00:55:53.900 --> 00:55:54.590
OK?

00:55:54.590 --> 00:56:00.800
So when you take this limit--
when you take this limit

00:56:00.800 --> 00:56:05.780
and it's-- then this
quantity goes to 0.

00:56:05.780 --> 00:56:11.080
And now, E tau can
actually be anything.

00:56:11.080 --> 00:56:14.340
As far as r sufficiently small.

00:56:14.340 --> 00:56:15.730
OK?

00:56:15.730 --> 00:56:25.090
So that means for any E tau,
you can even have huge energy--

00:56:25.090 --> 00:56:26.160
local proper energy.

00:56:29.850 --> 00:56:37.310
You can satisfy the
low energy limit

00:56:37.310 --> 00:56:42.780
if that mode live at
r very close to 0.

00:56:42.780 --> 00:56:48.490
Means that they live on
these throat deep enough.

00:56:48.490 --> 00:56:51.150
So this is a very simple.

00:56:51.150 --> 00:56:54.830
Physically, this is very simple.

00:56:54.830 --> 00:56:58.940
Because of this
curved space effect,

00:56:58.940 --> 00:57:02.470
because of H, this
curved space effect,

00:57:02.470 --> 00:57:05.530
there's a huge amount of
red shift between here

00:57:05.530 --> 00:57:09.050
and there-- between the local
proper time here and there.

00:57:09.050 --> 00:57:12.680
Very big energy here.

00:57:12.680 --> 00:57:16.880
Viewed from here, can
become very, very small.

00:57:16.880 --> 00:57:23.650
In particular, you go
deeper into this throat,

00:57:23.650 --> 00:57:26.030
the redshift factor is bigger.

00:57:26.030 --> 00:57:31.720
So normally, the higher the
energy, if you go deep enough,

00:57:31.720 --> 00:57:35.970
will always appear within
the low energy limit here.

00:57:35.970 --> 00:57:38.150
OK?

00:57:38.150 --> 00:57:39.000
OK?

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:42.072
So that means, when
you sit deep enough,

00:57:42.072 --> 00:57:48.130
that actually
anything is allowed,

00:57:48.130 --> 00:57:50.480
including a massive stream mode.

00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:52.340
OK?

00:57:52.340 --> 00:57:54.510
Including massive string mode.

00:57:54.510 --> 00:57:57.310
So now, we remember,
when r goes to 0,

00:57:57.310 --> 00:57:59.130
essentially you get
this AdS5 times S5.

00:58:02.210 --> 00:58:04.930
So in r equal to 0, we
just get this geometry,

00:58:04.930 --> 00:58:07.640
which is AdS5 times S5.

00:58:07.640 --> 00:58:17.860
So now what we find is that in
a low energy limit, in the B,

00:58:17.860 --> 00:58:24.195
we get free gravitons
at r equal to infinity.

00:58:27.770 --> 00:58:37.990
And then plus full string
theory AdS5 times S5.

00:58:41.266 --> 00:58:41.766
OK?

00:58:44.285 --> 00:58:45.660
Full string theory
AdS5 times S5.

00:58:53.900 --> 00:58:57.050
And again, the two
factors decouple,

00:58:57.050 --> 00:58:59.250
because when you take
the low energy limit,

00:58:59.250 --> 00:59:02.730
then those strings in
mode have to live very far

00:59:02.730 --> 00:59:06.150
down in the throat.

00:59:06.150 --> 00:59:08.600
And then they have low
overlap with the graviton

00:59:08.600 --> 00:59:10.610
and live at infinity.

00:59:10.610 --> 00:59:11.110
OK?

00:59:11.110 --> 00:59:13.651
And they have low overlap with
graviton and live at infinity.

00:59:13.651 --> 00:59:14.290
Yes?

00:59:14.290 --> 00:59:16.790
AUDIENCE: So I'm confused about
the way that you wrote that.

00:59:16.790 --> 00:59:19.054
So you say three-- so
there's three gravitons that

00:59:19.054 --> 00:59:19.720
are at infinity.

00:59:19.720 --> 00:59:21.779
But also full string theory.

00:59:21.779 --> 00:59:23.820
But doesn't full string
theory include gravitons?

00:59:23.820 --> 00:59:24.700
PROFESSOR: No, no, no.

00:59:24.700 --> 00:59:25.200
Yeah.

00:59:25.200 --> 00:59:32.180
This is-- there's some different
graviton ideas, 5 times S5.

00:59:32.180 --> 00:59:35.160
Full string theory
in AdS5 times S5.

00:59:35.160 --> 00:59:38.065
Those are Minkowski
space graviton.

00:59:38.065 --> 00:59:41.705
This is Minkowski
space graviton.

00:59:41.705 --> 00:59:45.452
So this is a Minkowski
space graviton.

00:59:45.452 --> 00:59:46.660
I think we should leave here.

00:59:51.310 --> 00:59:54.640
The natures are very different.

00:59:54.640 --> 00:59:55.606
OK?

00:59:55.606 --> 00:59:56.105
Yes?

00:59:56.105 --> 00:59:58.010
AUDIENCE: Is full string
theory only for closed strings?

00:59:58.010 --> 00:59:58.660
PROFESSOR: Only closed string.

00:59:58.660 --> 00:59:59.830
There's no open string
in this picture.

00:59:59.830 --> 01:00:00.996
They're only closed strings.

01:00:08.255 --> 01:00:08.830
OK?

01:00:08.830 --> 01:00:09.746
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

01:00:20.710 --> 01:00:22.990
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

01:00:22.990 --> 01:00:26.030
AUDIENCE: So [INAUDIBLE]?

01:00:26.030 --> 01:00:26.780
PROFESSOR: No, no.

01:00:26.780 --> 01:00:28.155
There's no artificial
separation.

01:00:28.155 --> 01:00:29.460
That's what I just explained.

01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:31.960
No free graviton live here.

01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:35.980
And the string theory live
infinite down the throat.

01:00:35.980 --> 01:00:37.990
Throat, in the low energy limit.

01:00:37.990 --> 01:00:43.250
There are infinite--
there are essentially

01:00:43.250 --> 01:00:46.770
as large proper distance as
you want to separate them.

01:00:46.770 --> 01:00:49.526
Depends how low
energy you want to go.

01:00:49.526 --> 01:00:52.900
AUDIENCE: But there is something
living at finite r, right?

01:00:52.900 --> 01:00:54.164
There is always [INAUDIBLE].

01:00:54.164 --> 01:00:54.830
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:00:54.830 --> 01:00:59.820
I'm just saying, when you
take the low energy limit,

01:00:59.820 --> 01:01:03.748
then the separation
then becomes infinite.

01:01:03.748 --> 01:01:05.831
AUDIENCE: I just don't
understand why [INAUDIBLE].

01:01:10.190 --> 01:01:10.940
PROFESSOR: No, no.

01:01:10.940 --> 01:01:12.870
They have nothing to
do with each other.

01:01:12.870 --> 01:01:14.170
AUDIENCE: Oh.

01:01:14.170 --> 01:01:18.401
PROFESSOR: Geographically, one
is in this side of the galaxy.

01:01:18.401 --> 01:01:20.400
The other is living on
the other side of galaxy.

01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:22.840
So their wave functions have
low overlap with each other.

01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:29.490
AUDIENCE: But with the
[INAUDIBLE] clearly something

01:01:29.490 --> 01:01:30.184
between there.

01:01:30.184 --> 01:01:30.850
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:01:30.850 --> 01:01:33.672
I'm just saying when you
take the low energy limit,

01:01:33.672 --> 01:01:37.160
then the only mode
which can survive,

01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:39.890
other than the massless mode,
which lives around here--

01:01:39.890 --> 01:01:42.500
just in the finite energy mode
that cannot live in this place.

01:01:46.790 --> 01:01:47.300
Yeah?

01:01:47.300 --> 01:01:50.340
AUDIENCE: Because the string
theory, or [INAUDIBLE],

01:01:50.340 --> 01:01:51.704
flux as well?

01:01:51.704 --> 01:01:52.370
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:01:52.370 --> 01:01:52.869
Yeah, yeah.

01:01:52.869 --> 01:01:55.600
Yeah, with the flux, yeah.

01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:00.140
Yeah.

01:02:03.111 --> 01:02:03.610
OK?

01:02:06.256 --> 01:02:07.880
Then these two factors
should decouple.

01:02:12.450 --> 01:02:21.480
So now we have derived--
see from this A equal to B,

01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:24.300
then we take the
low energy limit.

01:02:24.300 --> 01:02:28.368
So here, we have n equals
4 super Yang-Mills series

01:02:28.368 --> 01:02:30.263
plus three gravitons.

01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:43.370
And here, you have type
II B string and AdS5 times

01:02:43.370 --> 01:02:47.978
S5 plus free graviton.

01:02:52.660 --> 01:02:53.160
OK?

01:02:56.830 --> 01:03:00.030
And then the free
graviton part is the same.

01:03:00.030 --> 01:03:02.900
Then you conclude--
and they're just free.

01:03:02.900 --> 01:03:05.290
And they interact, in
part, of both sides,

01:03:05.290 --> 01:03:07.280
then you just equate them.

01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:18.200
You find the input for super
Yang-Mills series with uN,

01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:26.370
then it's equal to Type II
B strong AdS 5 times S5.

01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:45.690
So this was a surprising
statement, saying A equal to B.

01:03:45.690 --> 01:03:50.920
But A and B are both,
say, complicated objects.

01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:53.360
Both are complicated objects.

01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:57.370
But now, when we take
the low energy limit,

01:03:57.370 --> 01:03:59.370
and then you reach
something very surprising,

01:03:59.370 --> 01:04:03.160
because on this side,
there's no gravity.

01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:05.270
On this side,
there's no gravity.

01:04:05.270 --> 01:04:07.760
But this side is a
full string theory.

01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:10.615
So now you equate
some field theory

01:04:10.615 --> 01:04:14.020
with the full string theory.

01:04:14.020 --> 01:04:14.520
OK?

01:04:20.220 --> 01:04:20.760
Yes?

01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:22.240
AUDIENCE: So the
super Yang-Mills

01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:23.963
is living just on the D3 brane.

01:04:23.963 --> 01:04:24.629
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:04:24.629 --> 01:04:25.170
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:30.724
PROFESSOR: Any questions
regarding this?

01:04:30.724 --> 01:04:33.676
AUDIENCE: So for
example, [INAUDIBLE].

01:04:39.088 --> 01:04:40.570
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:04:40.570 --> 01:04:41.420
Yeah.

01:04:41.420 --> 01:04:44.540
But that's always valid
proper distance away.

01:04:44.540 --> 01:04:46.880
They always valid
proper distance.

01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:51.080
So the key is when you talk
about the general mode,

01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:54.270
you can-- anything you talk
about is finite distance away.

01:04:54.270 --> 01:04:55.790
If we are taking
a limit here, then

01:04:55.790 --> 01:04:57.164
this throat is
going to infinity,

01:04:57.164 --> 01:05:00.110
you are living infinite
down the throat.

01:05:00.110 --> 01:05:02.386
AUDIENCE: So anything
finite is free.

01:05:02.386 --> 01:05:07.195
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
anything-- when you

01:05:07.195 --> 01:05:10.100
talk about the finite energy,
than the story is always

01:05:10.100 --> 01:05:11.260
complicated.

01:05:11.260 --> 01:05:14.290
And then all this
geometry will matter.

01:05:14.290 --> 01:05:16.590
And the thing only becomes
simple-- you really

01:05:16.590 --> 01:05:19.010
take the E goes to 0 limit.

01:05:19.010 --> 01:05:22.300
It's the same thing here.

01:05:22.300 --> 01:05:24.710
Same thing, in this picture,
when we say you go to the n

01:05:24.710 --> 01:05:27.200
equals 4 super
Yang-Mills series,

01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:31.454
you always have to take that
limit-- E goes to 0 limit.

01:05:31.454 --> 01:05:33.370
Then you completely
decouple the other things.

01:05:33.370 --> 01:05:35.840
Because any tiny,
tiny non-zero E,

01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:37.830
there's always
some gravity left.

01:05:37.830 --> 01:05:39.950
So you really, really
have to take that energy,

01:05:39.950 --> 01:05:42.010
go to 0 limit.

01:05:42.010 --> 01:05:44.320
And then you rescale
the energy to be finite.

01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:45.960
You understand what I mean?

01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:47.902
You always have to take
that singular limit.

01:05:47.902 --> 01:05:49.860
It's just like, when you
take the-- [INAUDIBLE]

01:05:49.860 --> 01:05:51.850
you have to take the
infinite volume limit,

01:05:51.850 --> 01:05:53.970
and then things become simple.

01:05:53.970 --> 01:05:56.160
And here, it's the same thing.

01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:56.660
Yeah.

01:05:56.660 --> 01:05:58.500
Whenever you have
some finite energy,

01:05:58.500 --> 01:06:01.160
there's always some
coupling between them.

01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:06.999
Good?

01:06:06.999 --> 01:06:08.290
So do you want to have a break?

01:06:08.290 --> 01:06:09.060
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:06:09.060 --> 01:06:10.950
PROFESSOR: This is like
a physicist's guess

01:06:10.950 --> 01:06:13.670
that, somehow, these
two must be the same.

01:06:13.670 --> 01:06:15.940
OK?

01:06:15.940 --> 01:06:18.590
These two must be the same.

01:06:18.590 --> 01:06:21.090
So this is a
surprising statement.

01:06:21.090 --> 01:06:25.520
Because on the one side,
it's a field theory.

01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:28.466
And then on the other side,
it's a full gravity theory.

01:06:28.466 --> 01:06:29.915
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

01:06:29.915 --> 01:06:32.088
So you said that,
in principle, you

01:06:32.088 --> 01:06:36.194
can generalize the
solution for any metric

01:06:36.194 --> 01:06:39.092
in the full string
theory for any regime.

01:06:39.092 --> 01:06:40.058
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:06:40.058 --> 01:06:44.305
AUDIENCE: But in that case,
maybe you will probably not

01:06:44.305 --> 01:06:47.840
get a geometry as same as AdS5.

01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:48.570
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:06:48.570 --> 01:06:51.310
That's a very good question.

01:06:51.310 --> 01:06:53.050
That's a very good question.

01:06:53.050 --> 01:06:58.230
It turns out, indeed,
logically, you may not.

01:06:58.230 --> 01:07:02.976
But actually, AdS 5
times S5 is a highly--

01:07:02.976 --> 01:07:03.980
I said I will explain.

01:07:03.980 --> 01:07:06.450
It's a very highly
symmetric space.

01:07:06.450 --> 01:07:10.860
It turns out actually it
is exact string theory.

01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:14.050
At least we believe it's
exact string city geometry.

01:07:14.050 --> 01:07:16.050
And then when you include
all those corrections,

01:07:16.050 --> 01:07:16.924
this will not change.

01:07:19.930 --> 01:07:20.570
Yes?

01:07:20.570 --> 01:07:23.490
AUDIENCE: So with this in
mind, that means that people

01:07:23.490 --> 01:07:25.860
don't-- they only know
this heuristically.

01:07:25.860 --> 01:07:26.554
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:07:26.554 --> 01:07:28.054
AUDIENCE: So there's
no actual proof

01:07:28.054 --> 01:07:30.850
of this, besides the fact that
everyone believes it works.

01:07:30.850 --> 01:07:31.670
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:07:31.670 --> 01:07:33.610
It depends on what-- the label.

01:07:33.610 --> 01:07:34.817
What do you mean--

01:07:34.817 --> 01:07:36.250
AUDIENCE: Both.

01:07:36.250 --> 01:07:39.764
PROFESSOR: So the
physicist, the way it works

01:07:39.764 --> 01:07:41.930
is that 1 works, 2 works--
yeah, n equal to 1 works,

01:07:41.930 --> 01:07:44.830
n equal to 2 works, n equal to
3 works, n equal to 4 works,

01:07:44.830 --> 01:07:46.410
then we say it works.

01:07:46.410 --> 01:07:49.150
And under this,
I'm way past that.

01:07:49.150 --> 01:07:52.710
So maybe this works to n to the
10,000, something like that.

01:07:52.710 --> 01:07:53.595
But it's not a proof.

01:07:53.595 --> 01:07:54.220
AUDIENCE: Sure.

01:07:54.220 --> 01:07:54.600
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:55.710
But it worked to
the n to the 10,000.

01:07:55.710 --> 01:07:55.995
Something like that.

01:07:55.995 --> 01:07:56.536
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:08:00.497 --> 01:08:01.080
PROFESSOR: OK.

01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:02.240
Good?

01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:07.269
So now let's talk
about this duality.

01:08:07.269 --> 01:08:09.060
So this is normally
called AdS/CFT duality.

01:08:12.790 --> 01:08:13.290
OK?

01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:21.260
So to understand this
duality, let's first

01:08:21.260 --> 01:08:23.899
understand the object
in this relation.

01:08:23.899 --> 01:08:24.680
OK?

01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:27.155
So let me just say a
little bit about the object

01:08:27.155 --> 01:08:27.979
in this relation.

01:08:27.979 --> 01:08:31.740
First, let me say a little bit
about anti-de Sitter space,

01:08:31.740 --> 01:08:45.590
since that may not be something
you have worked before.

01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:50.029
OK?

01:08:50.029 --> 01:08:54.029
So one way to write the
metric is this metric.

01:08:54.029 --> 01:08:56.742
So this is AdS5.

01:08:56.742 --> 01:08:57.870
So this is AdS5.

01:09:00.580 --> 01:09:02.084
So this is AdS5 metric.

01:09:04.990 --> 01:09:07.830
So you can actually
write it as AdS-- yeah,

01:09:07.830 --> 01:09:10.149
let me just copy it down.

01:09:10.149 --> 01:09:14.600
So you can generalize to
any number of dimensions.

01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:18.100
You can generalize any
number of dimensions.

01:09:18.100 --> 01:09:21.300
If we make-- if
you make this part

01:09:21.300 --> 01:09:26.576
into a 3-dimensional
Minkowski spacetime, OK?

01:09:26.576 --> 01:09:34.665
And then this would
be the metric of AdS--

01:09:34.665 --> 01:09:36.899
say D plus 1 dimension.

01:09:36.899 --> 01:09:40.550
So this is a D plus 1
dimension, Minkowski.

01:09:40.550 --> 01:09:42.560
Than you have
another r direction.

01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:48.677
So let we call this my-- so now
let me relabel this to be 1.

01:09:48.677 --> 01:09:49.177
OK?

01:09:52.660 --> 01:09:56.820
So r can be considered
as a curvature radius

01:09:56.820 --> 01:09:58.270
of this spacetime.

01:09:58.270 --> 01:10:00.550
So this r is a constant.

01:10:00.550 --> 01:10:06.470
And this radius, r,
goes from 0 to infinity.

01:10:06.470 --> 01:10:08.980
OK?

01:10:08.980 --> 01:10:10.780
r goes to 0 from infinity.

01:10:10.780 --> 01:10:14.080
So roughly, a
geometric picture here

01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:19.120
is that-- so you can see
that you have half space.

01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:19.620
OK?

01:10:19.620 --> 01:10:21.860
You have a half space,
r from 0 to infinity.

01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:31.620
And that each value of
r-- at each value of r,

01:10:31.620 --> 01:10:33.140
there's a Minkowski spacetime.

01:10:35.750 --> 01:10:37.720
There's a d dimension
Minkowski spacetime.

01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:41.510
So if you fix r, then you just
get some d dimension Minkowski

01:10:41.510 --> 01:10:43.050
spacetime.

01:10:43.050 --> 01:10:46.040
And then with some pre-factor
to define the scale

01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:48.190
of that Minkowski spacetime.

01:10:48.190 --> 01:10:48.920
OK?

01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:53.310
So just like this, you
have a half line-- r from 0

01:10:53.310 --> 01:10:54.240
to infinity.

01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:57.110
Then at each point
of this half line,

01:10:57.110 --> 01:11:00.240
it's 48 D dimensional
Minkowski spacetime.

01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:02.100
So that's essentially
what this does.

01:11:02.100 --> 01:11:04.390
So the key thing is that
the Minkowski time is

01:11:04.390 --> 01:11:06.630
what we normally called warped.

01:11:06.630 --> 01:11:12.890
It's that the scale factor
of this Minkowski spacetime

01:11:12.890 --> 01:11:17.040
depends on where you sit
in the radial direction.

01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:17.590
OK?

01:11:17.590 --> 01:11:19.690
So this r, we normally
call radial direction.

01:11:19.690 --> 01:11:22.970
It depends on where you sit
in the radial direction.

01:11:22.970 --> 01:11:32.030
So when your r goes to
infinity, the scale size

01:11:32.030 --> 01:11:33.890
becomes infinite.

01:11:33.890 --> 01:11:36.578
So this, we'd normally
call it to be the boundary.

01:11:42.510 --> 01:11:44.610
So this we call to
be the boundary.

01:11:44.610 --> 01:11:46.270
So r equals infinity,
we call to be

01:11:46.270 --> 01:11:51.520
the boundary of the spacetime.

01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:53.180
So this is similar
to, say, when we

01:11:53.180 --> 01:11:59.220
say-- when we write-- a
Euclidean metric in this form,

01:11:59.220 --> 01:12:02.270
when r goes to infinity, the
sphere size become infinite,

01:12:02.270 --> 01:12:05.190
and then this is essentially
the spacetime boundary, roughly.

01:12:05.190 --> 01:12:08.460
And so this can be
similarly understandable.

01:12:08.460 --> 01:12:08.960
OK?

01:12:11.470 --> 01:12:16.180
So this idea is
spacetime-- idea is

01:12:16.180 --> 01:12:23.561
spacetime of constant
curvature-- constant negative

01:12:23.561 --> 01:12:24.060
curvature.

01:12:32.826 --> 01:12:34.300
OK?

01:12:34.300 --> 01:12:37.020
In fact, this is the
most symmetric spacetime

01:12:37.020 --> 01:12:38.875
of [INAUDIBLE]
constant curvature.

01:12:41.740 --> 01:12:44.930
So you can easily check.

01:12:44.930 --> 01:12:48.650
You can easily check this
satisfy the Einstein equation

01:12:48.650 --> 01:12:51.660
with the [INAUDIBLE] constant.

01:12:51.660 --> 01:12:55.110
So you can easily check if
you satisfied the Einstein

01:12:55.110 --> 01:12:56.380
equation.

01:12:56.380 --> 01:12:59.980
So now, because I'm using
this r to denote this radius,

01:12:59.980 --> 01:13:01.110
this curvature radius.

01:13:01.110 --> 01:13:02.980
So now I will quote my
curvature [INAUDIBLE]

01:13:02.980 --> 01:13:05.890
always using the script now.

01:13:05.890 --> 01:13:10.580
So also, MN now refers to
all directions in this AdS.

01:13:15.890 --> 01:13:19.060
So you can easily check if you
satisfy this Einstein question

01:13:19.060 --> 01:13:21.150
with some cross-module constant.

01:13:21.150 --> 01:13:23.950
And you can just
compute the-- it's

01:13:23.950 --> 01:13:26.060
easy to compute the
curvature of this guy.

01:13:26.060 --> 01:13:27.990
So let me just write
down the answer.

01:13:27.990 --> 01:13:30.400
So yeah, at first
you can-- yeah,

01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:32.400
you can compute the
curvature of this guy.

01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:33.608
You can just find the answer.

01:13:33.608 --> 01:13:38.480
You find the curvature,
the rich scalar

01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:43.980
is given by minus D
times D plus 1 R squared.

01:13:43.980 --> 01:13:45.400
OK?

01:13:45.400 --> 01:13:46.610
So this is a rich scalar.

01:13:46.610 --> 01:13:50.557
This R is the same as this R.

01:13:50.557 --> 01:13:52.890
And then similarity, you find
the cross-module constant.

01:13:52.890 --> 01:13:54.850
Then you can find here.

01:13:54.850 --> 01:14:02.240
It's given by minus 1/2 D
minus 1 divided by R squared.

01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:04.854
Sorry, here it
should be minus 2.

01:14:08.111 --> 01:14:08.610
OK?

01:14:14.340 --> 01:14:21.450
And I said that this is the
most symmetric homogeneous

01:14:21.450 --> 01:14:24.350
negative curvature spacetime.

01:14:24.350 --> 01:14:27.550
So this is reflected
in that actually you

01:14:27.550 --> 01:14:36.680
can write the Riemann
tensor-- the Riemann tensor

01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:41.780
of this spacetime purely in
terms of this metric itself.

01:14:41.780 --> 01:15:01.839
Without using derivative-- OK?

01:15:01.839 --> 01:15:03.380
So this is essentially
the definition

01:15:03.380 --> 01:15:07.150
of the most
symmetric [INAUDIBLE]

01:15:07.150 --> 01:15:11.100
active curvature spacetime,
is that the Riemann tensor

01:15:11.100 --> 01:15:14.856
can be written solely in
terms of metric itself.

01:15:14.856 --> 01:15:15.356
OK?

01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:28.120
So these are just some
facts of this space.

01:15:28.120 --> 01:15:33.090
So often, we use a
lot of coordinates.

01:15:33.090 --> 01:15:36.970
Sometimes it's often
convenient to use--

01:15:36.970 --> 01:15:41.855
instead of using this r, we will
introduce another coordinate.

01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:47.520
We introduce a z.

01:15:47.520 --> 01:15:51.690
You go to R squared divided
by-- capital R squared

01:15:51.690 --> 01:15:54.430
divided by small r.

01:15:54.430 --> 01:15:57.440
Essentially, it's
just the 1 over R.

01:15:57.440 --> 01:16:02.400
And because the capital R
goes from 0 to infinity,

01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:07.020
then it's more z also
going from 0 to infinity.

01:16:07.020 --> 01:16:10.820
But now, the boundary--
but now it's equal to 0

01:16:10.820 --> 01:16:19.470
is the boundary, rather
than equal to infinity.

01:16:19.470 --> 01:16:23.430
And then the metric
can be written

01:16:23.430 --> 01:16:27.500
in the slightly different way
in terms of this z coordinate.

01:16:39.230 --> 01:16:40.280
We can in this form.

01:16:40.280 --> 01:16:40.780
OK?

01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:46.240
You can see there is a d.

01:16:49.070 --> 01:16:54.730
So again, here, you just
change the label r by z.

01:16:54.730 --> 01:16:57.780
And now it's equal to
0, is the boundary.

01:16:57.780 --> 01:17:00.362
And they're going to interior,
because one increases D.

01:17:00.362 --> 01:17:02.070
So D equals 1 into a
different direction.

01:17:06.440 --> 01:17:07.518
OK?

01:17:07.518 --> 01:17:08.434
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

01:17:20.150 --> 01:17:21.470
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:17:21.470 --> 01:17:23.690
That's a very good question.

01:17:23.690 --> 01:17:27.310
I'm waiting for
some of you to ask.

01:17:27.310 --> 01:17:38.400
So this is the physicist's
metric which we described.

01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:40.450
Yeah, this is the
physicist's metric.

01:17:40.450 --> 01:17:43.950
So yeah, let me just
say it this way.

01:17:48.314 --> 01:17:49.605
So you have an infinite throat.

01:17:52.450 --> 01:17:56.810
So going to low energy limit,
we should just go very much down

01:17:56.810 --> 01:17:58.240
in the throat.

01:17:58.240 --> 01:17:59.860
OK?

01:17:59.860 --> 01:18:04.510
Because once you decouple
those decreased freedom,

01:18:04.510 --> 01:18:07.310
then you can just
rescale your energy scale

01:18:07.310 --> 01:18:09.520
to whatever you want.

01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:11.317
You go to finite
energy, et cetera.

01:18:11.317 --> 01:18:12.650
And that's why you go into AdS5.

01:18:16.070 --> 01:18:16.650
Yeah.

01:18:16.650 --> 01:18:21.980
Once you decouple those things,
then you are living AdS.

01:18:21.980 --> 01:18:23.955
Then you are living
in the AdS, and then

01:18:23.955 --> 01:18:26.160
you can talk about
the energy scale,

01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:27.970
or any radius as you want.

01:18:27.970 --> 01:18:31.360
It just becomes
relative to itself.

01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:32.586
You see what I mean?

01:18:32.586 --> 01:18:34.211
AUDIENCE: That's kind
of normalization?

01:18:36.257 --> 01:18:36.840
PROFESSOR: No.

01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:38.150
This is not normalization.

01:18:38.150 --> 01:18:42.340
This is just-- normally,
when we take a low energy

01:18:42.340 --> 01:18:45.890
limit, the reason
we take a low energy

01:18:45.890 --> 01:18:49.860
limit is we want to decouple
those massive modes.

01:18:49.860 --> 01:18:52.480
As once we decouple
those massive modes,

01:18:52.480 --> 01:18:55.100
then we consider
the finite energy.

01:18:55.100 --> 01:18:56.820
And we include
the finite energy.

01:18:56.820 --> 01:19:01.350
Because we consider finite
energy relative to low--

01:19:01.350 --> 01:19:04.310
we still consider a
finite range of energy.

01:19:04.310 --> 01:19:05.700
It's the same thing as that.

01:19:08.230 --> 01:19:09.400
Is this clear to everybody?

01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:11.930
This is a very important point.

01:19:11.930 --> 01:19:14.600
Yeah.

01:19:14.600 --> 01:19:15.820
Good.

01:19:15.820 --> 01:19:16.390
Yeah?

01:19:16.390 --> 01:19:17.860
AUDIENCE: What was the question?

01:19:17.860 --> 01:19:22.030
PROFESSOR: The question
is that previously,

01:19:22.030 --> 01:19:25.690
in order to decouple
those high energy

01:19:25.690 --> 01:19:28.300
modes, when we take
a low energy limit,

01:19:28.300 --> 01:19:30.850
we have to take r equal to 0.

01:19:30.850 --> 01:19:33.940
And why here we worry
about r goes to infinity--

01:19:33.940 --> 01:19:36.850
r equals infinity here?

01:19:36.850 --> 01:19:37.770
OK?

01:19:37.770 --> 01:19:40.100
Why are we worried
about r equals infinity.

01:19:40.100 --> 01:19:44.720
It seems like this is going
outside our previous regime.

01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:49.880
But the answer is that, once
we decouple those high energy

01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:54.230
modes, then you can just
extend to whatever energy range

01:19:54.230 --> 01:19:55.300
you want.

01:19:55.300 --> 01:19:57.690
Because you have served
the purpose of discover--

01:19:57.690 --> 01:20:00.730
decouple those-- yeah,
because those things already

01:20:00.730 --> 01:20:02.060
went to infinity.

01:20:02.060 --> 01:20:05.360
You don't have to
worry about them.

01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:05.860
Is it clear?

01:20:08.440 --> 01:20:10.409
Just like in the
Yang-Mills theory,

01:20:10.409 --> 01:20:11.950
we said we take the
low energy limit.

01:20:11.950 --> 01:20:14.092
We decouple those massive modes.

01:20:14.092 --> 01:20:15.800
But eventually, in
the Yang-Mills theory,

01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:17.820
we would consider very
high energy processing

01:20:17.820 --> 01:20:20.990
in the Yang-Mills theory.

01:20:20.990 --> 01:20:21.900
OK?

01:20:21.900 --> 01:20:26.386
But those things we decouple
have even higher energy scale.

01:20:26.386 --> 01:20:26.886
OK?

01:20:30.310 --> 01:20:33.010
Good, good, good.

01:20:33.010 --> 01:20:38.770
So we call this-- so
this is 1 and this is 2.

01:20:38.770 --> 01:20:41.970
So in fact, actually
1 and 2, they're

01:20:41.970 --> 01:20:47.300
not covering the full
anti-de Sitter spacetime.

01:20:47.300 --> 01:20:48.855
So actually, they
only cover a part

01:20:48.855 --> 01:20:51.090
of anti-de Sitter spacetime.

01:20:51.090 --> 01:20:55.530
So they only cover, say, what
is so-called Poincare patch,

01:20:55.530 --> 01:20:59.200
a patch of de-Sitter spacetime,
anti-de Sitter spacetime.

01:20:59.200 --> 01:21:02.470
So now let me just mention a
little bit what is normally

01:21:02.470 --> 01:21:03.900
called a global AdS.

01:21:03.900 --> 01:21:04.950
OK?

01:21:04.950 --> 01:21:13.120
So the AdS, or global
AdS-- so let me first

01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:14.310
write down this sentence.

01:21:14.310 --> 01:21:32.660
So 1, 2-- 1 over 2 only
covers a part of full AdS.

01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:40.220
OK?

01:21:40.220 --> 01:21:48.380
So the global AdS, the
so-called global AdS,

01:21:48.380 --> 01:21:57.380
can be defined--
can be described

01:21:57.380 --> 01:22:00.411
as a hyperboloid in
the Lorentz spacetime.

01:22:00.411 --> 01:22:00.910
OK?

01:22:03.420 --> 01:22:15.615
Hyperboloid in Minkowski--
d plus 2 Minkowski

01:22:15.615 --> 01:22:22.730
spacetime of signature 2, d.

01:22:22.730 --> 01:22:24.080
OK?

01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:30.880
So to make this precise,
say, for example,

01:22:30.880 --> 01:22:33.380
if you go to the
[INAUDIBLE]-- for example,

01:22:33.380 --> 01:22:39.120
the book by Hawking and
Ellis called The Large Scale

01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:44.990
Structure of Spacetime, the way
they define the anti-de Sitter

01:22:44.990 --> 01:22:47.220
as follows.

01:22:47.220 --> 01:22:52.730
So you consider d + 2 dimension
of Minkowski spacetime

01:22:52.730 --> 01:22:55.340
with signature 2, d.

01:22:55.340 --> 01:22:59.850
So you consider a Minkowski
spacetime like this.

01:23:12.999 --> 01:23:14.460
OK?

01:23:14.460 --> 01:23:18.850
So now you have d,
positive signature,

01:23:18.850 --> 01:23:20.960
and the two negative signature.

01:23:20.960 --> 01:23:26.050
So x starts from minus 1
index to 0, which gives you

01:23:26.050 --> 01:23:27.770
the negative signature.

01:23:27.770 --> 01:23:31.170
And then you have-- so this is
Minkowski spacetime of the 2,

01:23:31.170 --> 01:23:33.930
d signature.

01:23:33.930 --> 01:23:36.650
So now you can see that
the following hyper surface

01:23:36.650 --> 01:23:37.400
in that spacetime.

01:23:50.470 --> 01:23:52.460
OK?

01:23:52.460 --> 01:23:56.410
So this is a hyperboloid
in that spacetime.

01:23:56.410 --> 01:23:58.760
And this defines your AdS.

01:23:58.760 --> 01:23:59.260
OK?

01:23:59.260 --> 01:24:01.090
So this surface defines AdS.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.330
This surface defines AdS.

01:24:12.430 --> 01:24:14.280
So, of course, this is
a very different way

01:24:14.280 --> 01:24:18.850
to parametrize AdS.

01:24:18.850 --> 01:24:20.920
Then either this
metric or that metric.

01:24:23.610 --> 01:24:25.350
And you can actually
parametrize AdS

01:24:25.350 --> 01:24:27.150
in many, many different ways.

01:24:27.150 --> 01:24:29.550
So now let me just
mention a few ways

01:24:29.550 --> 01:24:33.420
to-- a few choices of different
coordinates to parametrize

01:24:33.420 --> 01:24:34.251
this hyperboloid.

01:24:34.251 --> 01:24:34.750
OK?

01:24:37.780 --> 01:24:40.650
So the first is-- one is called
the Poincare coordinates.

01:24:40.650 --> 01:24:41.470
It's this one.

01:24:53.800 --> 01:24:57.490
So first is what we call
the Poincare coordinates.

01:24:57.490 --> 01:25:00.600
So in this Poincare
coordinates, you introduce r.

01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:07.410
So r there is given
by x minus 1 plus xd.

01:25:07.410 --> 01:25:10.980
So you take the 1 over
the negative signature

01:25:10.980 --> 01:25:13.352
and the 1 over the
positive signature.

01:25:13.352 --> 01:25:16.150
You take x minus 1xd,
add them together.

01:25:16.150 --> 01:25:19.270
So this is like some
kind of [INAUDIBLE].

01:25:19.270 --> 01:25:23.600
And then you write x mu.

01:25:23.600 --> 01:25:30.366
So there, we always
write x mu equal to tx.

01:25:30.366 --> 01:25:31.220
OK?

01:25:31.220 --> 01:25:33.935
So this is a three-dimensional
Minkowski coordinate.

01:25:33.935 --> 01:25:44.510
You add x mu equal to r times
capital mu divided by r.

01:25:44.510 --> 01:25:46.630
OK?

01:25:46.630 --> 01:25:56.370
So in this hyperboloid,
you make this definition.

01:25:56.370 --> 01:25:59.270
And then you restrict to the
region of r greater than 0.

01:26:02.450 --> 01:26:04.340
Then you recover.

01:26:04.340 --> 01:26:16.700
So 1 corresponds to r greater
than 0 part of this metric,

01:26:16.700 --> 01:26:18.154
of this spacetime.

01:26:18.154 --> 01:26:19.570
And you can easily
check yourself.

01:26:19.570 --> 01:26:23.310
Just make this definition-- this
is the exercise you should do,

01:26:23.310 --> 01:26:25.080
which I don't have
time to do here.

01:26:25.080 --> 01:26:26.710
Just plug this in.

01:26:26.710 --> 01:26:29.680
Plug this into that metric.

01:26:29.680 --> 01:26:32.350
Plug this parametrization
into that metric,

01:26:32.350 --> 01:26:36.050
and then you find
you will recover 1.

01:26:36.050 --> 01:26:40.260
Of course, 1 is only restricted
to r equal to 0 to infinity.

01:26:40.260 --> 01:26:44.357
So you only restrict to r
greater than 0 part of this.

01:26:44.357 --> 01:26:46.690
And if you just introduce
this in [INAUDIBLE], of course

01:26:46.690 --> 01:26:48.471
r can be smaller than 0.

01:26:48.471 --> 01:26:48.970
OK?

01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:53.680
So these are
Poincare coordinates.

01:26:53.680 --> 01:26:56.620
So once you go to that metric,
you then go to this metric.

01:26:56.620 --> 01:26:58.974
It's the same.

01:26:58.974 --> 01:27:00.390
Now also let me
describe something

01:27:00.390 --> 01:27:01.640
called the global coordinates.

01:27:12.810 --> 01:27:16.810
So this is-- if I notice
the following structure.

01:27:16.810 --> 01:27:23.240
So this has the form of the
difference of two squares.

01:27:23.240 --> 01:27:32.670
So I can write-- so
let's write xi to 1

01:27:32.670 --> 01:27:38.120
to d xi squared to
be some function,

01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:40.920
r squared and r squared--
times r squared.

01:27:40.920 --> 01:27:43.490
So this r have nothing
to do with that r now.

01:27:43.490 --> 01:27:45.770
We are doing a different
set of coordinates.

01:27:45.770 --> 01:27:48.975
I'm just using the same
notation for convenience.

01:27:51.540 --> 01:27:54.890
So let's introduce a new
coordinate, r, which is just

01:27:54.890 --> 01:27:58.070
the sum of all these squared.

01:27:58.070 --> 01:28:02.335
And then I introduce--
then from this equation,

01:28:02.335 --> 01:28:07.460
the x1 minus x0 squared
should be equal to r

01:28:07.460 --> 01:28:11.650
squared plus 1 times r squared.

01:28:11.650 --> 01:28:12.150
OK?

01:28:15.570 --> 01:28:20.070
So now I can-- so
this is a circle.

01:28:20.070 --> 01:28:21.850
So for fixed r,
this is a circle.

01:28:24.420 --> 01:28:29.400
For fixed r, this is a d
minus 1 dimensional sphere.

01:28:29.400 --> 01:28:31.160
OK?

01:28:31.160 --> 01:28:35.560
So I can introduce the d minus
1 spherical coordinates on this

01:28:35.560 --> 01:28:38.880
and then introduce a
circular coordinate on this.

01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:42.080
So if I do that--
so let me just call

01:28:42.080 --> 01:28:46.890
the circular coordinate on
here tau, the polar coordinate

01:28:46.890 --> 01:28:49.000
in the x minus y.

01:28:51.520 --> 01:29:03.380
Polar coordinate in the x
minus 1 and the x0 plane.

01:29:03.380 --> 01:29:04.730
So let me call this tau.

01:29:04.730 --> 01:29:06.880
And let me call
[INAUDIBLE] coordinate

01:29:06.880 --> 01:29:11.020
here omega d minus 1.

01:29:11.020 --> 01:29:12.960
OK?

01:29:12.960 --> 01:29:16.270
Then you plug this into here.

01:29:16.270 --> 01:29:18.316
Then you find the
following metric.

01:29:30.640 --> 01:29:33.310
So you find the
following metric.

01:29:33.310 --> 01:29:44.005
You find ds squared equal to r
squared minus 1 plus r squared

01:29:44.005 --> 01:29:53.790
d tau squared plus the r
squared plus 1 plus r squared

01:29:53.790 --> 01:29:59.080
plus r squared d omega
d minus 1 squared.

01:29:59.080 --> 01:29:59.580
OK?

01:30:10.910 --> 01:30:13.310
So remember, tau is
the polar coordinate

01:30:13.310 --> 01:30:15.910
in this x minus 1 and x0 plane.

01:30:15.910 --> 01:30:19.420
And the omega d minus 1 is
the polar coordinate in the x1

01:30:19.420 --> 01:30:23.560
to xd OK?

01:30:23.560 --> 01:30:26.019
And then you get this.

01:30:26.019 --> 01:30:28.310
Again, it's an exercise you
should go through yourself.

01:30:28.310 --> 01:30:28.760
Yes?

01:30:28.760 --> 01:30:29.110
AUDIENCE: So I have a question.

01:30:29.110 --> 01:30:30.568
So I'm just trying
to visualize it.

01:30:30.568 --> 01:30:33.425
So there's these-- at least the
way it works in [INAUDIBLE].

01:30:33.425 --> 01:30:35.110
So you have these
two sheets which

01:30:35.110 --> 01:30:36.690
are disjoint from each other.

01:30:36.690 --> 01:30:42.061
So how is it that this enables
us to go smoothly between them?

01:30:42.061 --> 01:30:44.560
It seems that there's-- so maybe
I'm confused about what you

01:30:44.560 --> 01:30:45.984
did.

01:30:45.984 --> 01:30:47.150
PROFESSOR: What do you mean?

01:30:47.150 --> 01:30:50.170
AUDIENCE: So we're trying to
describe this object, which

01:30:50.170 --> 01:30:52.030
is two disjoint components.

01:30:52.030 --> 01:30:55.524
PROFESSOR: We only
look at one component.

01:30:55.524 --> 01:30:57.750
AUDIENCE: So what's the
point of global coordinates?

01:30:57.750 --> 01:30:59.154
Is it just a different--

01:30:59.154 --> 01:31:00.070
PROFESSOR: No, no, no.

01:31:00.070 --> 01:31:02.028
No, that only covers part
of the one component.

01:31:05.700 --> 01:31:06.819
AUDIENCE: Oh, I see.

01:31:06.819 --> 01:31:07.777
OK.

01:31:07.777 --> 01:31:08.548
Yes.

01:31:08.548 --> 01:31:09.214
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:31:15.450 --> 01:31:16.650
OK, good.

01:31:16.650 --> 01:31:21.900
So you look at here-- yeah.

01:31:21.900 --> 01:31:25.140
Again, r goes from
0 to infinity.

01:31:25.140 --> 01:31:27.160
But this r is very
different from this r now.

01:31:27.160 --> 01:31:29.720
OK?

01:31:29.720 --> 01:31:35.020
So in this definition,
tau is a polar coordinate.

01:31:35.020 --> 01:31:38.360
So in this definition, tau
will go from 0 to 2 pi.

01:31:38.360 --> 01:31:40.170
OK?

01:31:40.170 --> 01:31:46.135
But once you write it in this
form, nothing depends on tau.

01:31:46.135 --> 01:31:49.040
So you can extend tau
to any range you want.

01:31:49.040 --> 01:31:50.870
So once we write
this form, we take

01:31:50.870 --> 01:31:55.890
tau goes to minus
infinity to plus infinity.

01:31:55.890 --> 01:32:01.480
So this is [INAUDIBLE],
rather than from 0 to 2 pi,

01:32:01.480 --> 01:32:04.580
we take tau from minus
infinity to plus infinity.

01:32:04.580 --> 01:32:08.210
So sometimes, this is
also called extended AdS.

01:32:08.210 --> 01:32:11.180
Sometimes people don't
just bother to do that.

01:32:11.180 --> 01:32:12.650
You just extend
it automatically.

01:32:12.650 --> 01:32:13.250
OK?

01:32:13.250 --> 01:32:19.310
So strictly speaking, this,
as a definition of AdS,

01:32:19.310 --> 01:32:22.220
only corresponding to the
part of tau from 0 to 2 pi.

01:32:22.220 --> 01:32:23.040
OK?

01:32:23.040 --> 01:32:26.919
And when you extend
tau from minus infinity

01:32:26.919 --> 01:32:29.460
to plus infinity, you actually
have an infinite copy of this.

01:32:33.601 --> 01:32:34.100
OK.

01:32:34.100 --> 01:32:38.340
So now, with one more thing,
we can-- so this coordinate

01:32:38.340 --> 01:32:40.140
is nice.

01:32:40.140 --> 01:32:42.569
Now it covers everything.

01:32:42.569 --> 01:32:44.860
Covers everything, but even
actually a little bit more.

01:32:44.860 --> 01:32:49.750
Because now you extend
the tau to minus infinity.

01:32:49.750 --> 01:32:51.200
We can visualize
this metrically.

01:32:51.200 --> 01:32:54.350
It might be better by
doing the following.

01:32:54.350 --> 01:32:56.110
Allow the transformation.

01:32:56.110 --> 01:33:00.440
So now let's take--
yeah, before I do

01:33:00.440 --> 01:33:03.240
that, let me say a
few words about-- let

01:33:03.240 --> 01:33:05.880
me just do this first.

01:33:05.880 --> 01:33:08.560
Let's take tau again.

01:33:08.560 --> 01:33:10.300
Take r equal to tangent rho.

01:33:10.300 --> 01:33:13.710
Rho is some other coordinate.

01:33:13.710 --> 01:33:15.400
And r from 0 to infinity.

01:33:15.400 --> 01:33:21.170
Then rho would be from
0 to 2 pi, pi over 2.

01:33:21.170 --> 01:33:22.900
OK?

01:33:22.900 --> 01:33:26.050
0 to pi over 2.

01:33:26.050 --> 01:33:31.530
And you park this into
here with a little bit

01:33:31.530 --> 01:33:36.980
tiny-- so after two seconds,
you find the following metric.

01:33:48.712 --> 01:33:49.212
OK?

01:33:58.674 --> 01:34:00.830
So this is easy to see.

01:34:00.830 --> 01:34:02.750
Because 1 plus
[INAUDIBLE] rho squared

01:34:02.750 --> 01:34:08.150
is just 1 over cosine
squared, et cetera.

01:34:08.150 --> 01:34:10.285
So the reason this
metric is nice,

01:34:10.285 --> 01:34:13.360
because other than
this conformal factor,

01:34:13.360 --> 01:34:16.660
this thing we can
easily rationalize.

01:34:16.660 --> 01:34:18.830
So this is just a cylinder.

01:34:18.830 --> 01:34:22.384
So this is just a cylinder.

01:34:22.384 --> 01:34:23.356
Let me draw it here.

01:34:35.020 --> 01:34:36.200
So this is a cylinder.

01:34:44.510 --> 01:34:46.520
OK?

01:34:46.520 --> 01:34:48.670
So this direction
can be considered--

01:34:48.670 --> 01:34:53.895
the radial direction
is the rho direction.

01:34:56.570 --> 01:34:59.775
And this direction
is the tau direction.

01:35:04.530 --> 01:35:09.794
And this direction is
the omega d minus 1,

01:35:09.794 --> 01:35:11.210
or the polar
coordinate direction.

01:35:11.210 --> 01:35:14.660
I'm only drawing one of them.

01:35:14.660 --> 01:35:17.270
OK?

01:35:17.270 --> 01:35:20.740
So essentially, this I have
a structure of a cylinder.

01:35:20.740 --> 01:35:24.630
And at the center here,
I have rho equal to 0.

01:35:24.630 --> 01:35:28.290
And here, I have rho
equal to pi over 2.

01:35:28.290 --> 01:35:29.010
OK?

01:35:29.010 --> 01:35:31.832
Took rho from 0 to pi over 2.

01:35:31.832 --> 01:35:32.790
OK?

01:35:32.790 --> 01:35:37.660
And when you go to pi over 2,
its quotient factor goes to 0.

01:35:37.660 --> 01:35:40.510
So the overall scale blows up.

01:35:40.510 --> 01:35:41.995
But here is your boundary.

01:35:44.580 --> 01:35:53.630
So pi over 2-- yeah, so
pi over 2 is the boundary.

01:35:57.860 --> 01:36:00.100
OK?

01:36:00.100 --> 01:36:03.010
Is this clear?

01:36:03.010 --> 01:36:04.390
So pi over 2 is the boundary.

01:36:04.390 --> 01:36:05.870
Now the boundary map.

01:36:05.870 --> 01:36:14.810
So the boundary of the
cylinder-- so the boundary now

01:36:14.810 --> 01:36:21.150
is sitting at rho
equal to pi over 2,

01:36:21.150 --> 01:36:27.920
has the topology of
r times s d minus 1.

01:36:27.920 --> 01:36:28.590
OK?

01:36:28.590 --> 01:36:30.914
So the boundary itself,
it's-- so the boundary itself,

01:36:30.914 --> 01:36:31.580
it's a cylinder.

01:36:31.580 --> 01:36:33.770
The whole space is
a solid cylinder.

01:36:33.770 --> 01:36:35.480
It's a field cylinder.

01:36:35.480 --> 01:36:38.060
OK?

01:36:38.060 --> 01:36:40.706
But the scale factor blows up
when you approach the boundary,

01:36:40.706 --> 01:36:42.134
because of this prefactor.

01:36:46.420 --> 01:36:49.610
And the r is the time
and the sd minus 1

01:36:49.610 --> 01:36:57.030
is the-- now, to visualize
this space a little bit better,

01:36:57.030 --> 01:36:59.710
let's look at the cross section.

01:36:59.710 --> 01:37:02.830
So imagine you put a
plane in this space.

01:37:02.830 --> 01:37:04.020
OK?

01:37:04.020 --> 01:37:10.170
So now let me call this circular
direction, it's called theta.

01:37:10.170 --> 01:37:12.370
And then now let's
consider the cross section

01:37:12.370 --> 01:37:15.580
across this solid cylinder.

01:37:15.580 --> 01:37:17.770
So then we just have a plane.

01:37:20.850 --> 01:37:21.998
OK?

01:37:21.998 --> 01:37:22.996
A plane.

01:37:22.996 --> 01:37:29.120
I should not have-- let's
consider this cross section.

01:37:29.120 --> 01:37:29.810
OK?

01:37:29.810 --> 01:37:32.840
In the center of this cylinder.

01:37:32.840 --> 01:37:34.570
Cut half.

01:37:34.570 --> 01:37:37.260
Cylinder cut in half.

01:37:37.260 --> 01:37:41.790
So for example,
in this notation,

01:37:41.790 --> 01:37:44.410
so this will be rho equal to 0.

01:37:44.410 --> 01:37:47.690
So here is rho
equal to pi over 2.

01:37:47.690 --> 01:37:50.620
And I introduced this
angular coordinate.

01:37:50.620 --> 01:37:53.600
So that equals 1 into
theta equal to 0.

01:37:53.600 --> 01:37:59.450
And here will be, again, rho
equal to pi over 2 of theta

01:37:59.450 --> 01:38:01.122
equal to pi.

01:38:01.122 --> 01:38:01.621
OK?

01:38:06.689 --> 01:38:08.230
And again, this is
the tau direction.

01:38:11.260 --> 01:38:13.200
Is it clear what I'm doing?

01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:16.695
I cut the cylinder in half,
and that's that cross section.

01:38:24.200 --> 01:38:29.406
So now, because of
the structure of this

01:38:29.406 --> 01:38:34.740
times a conformal factor
overall, a scale factor.

01:38:34.740 --> 01:38:37.690
So the propagation
of a light ray

01:38:37.690 --> 01:38:40.720
does not depend on
this overall factor.

01:38:40.720 --> 01:38:43.680
The propagation of that
ray can be seen from here.

01:38:43.680 --> 01:38:44.650
OK?

01:38:44.650 --> 01:38:47.120
So now, let's consider
radial light ray,

01:38:47.120 --> 01:38:49.460
which only goes into
the rho direction.

01:38:49.460 --> 01:38:52.860
There's no in this
angular direction.

01:38:52.860 --> 01:38:55.850
Let's consider radial light ray.

01:38:55.850 --> 01:38:59.670
Then from that picture,
it's very clear--

01:38:59.670 --> 01:39:01.290
let's say this is
tau equal to 0.

01:39:04.070 --> 01:39:08.651
Then it actually
takes only pi over 2

01:39:08.651 --> 01:39:10.150
for light ray to
reach the boundary.

01:39:13.300 --> 01:39:13.800
OK?

01:39:13.800 --> 01:39:16.840
Because rho only
goes from pi over 2,

01:39:16.840 --> 01:39:20.490
and light ray always
travel in 45 degrees.

01:39:20.490 --> 01:39:23.060
So this is just like-- if
you look at the [INAUDIBLE]

01:39:23.060 --> 01:39:26.680
plus the rho squared,
this is Minkowski.

01:39:26.680 --> 01:39:29.090
And so light ray
travel 45 degree.

01:39:32.560 --> 01:39:34.880
And then you reach the boundary.

01:39:34.880 --> 01:39:36.370
And then take log of pi over 2.

01:39:36.370 --> 01:39:37.920
Yeah, so this is pi over 2.

01:39:37.920 --> 01:39:39.010
So this is tau equal to 0.

01:39:39.010 --> 01:39:48.710
And then this would be
tau equal to pi over 2.

01:39:48.710 --> 01:39:52.589
Then suppose that you put
some reflecting wall here.

01:39:56.900 --> 01:40:05.130
And by the time tau equal
to pi, it has bounced back.

01:40:05.130 --> 01:40:06.950
OK?

01:40:06.950 --> 01:40:09.820
And now, if you go
another round, then

01:40:09.820 --> 01:40:12.970
at tau equal to 2
pi, then precisely

01:40:12.970 --> 01:40:15.220
go back to the origin.

01:40:15.220 --> 01:40:17.470
Then go through a period.

01:40:17.470 --> 01:40:18.330
OK?

01:40:18.330 --> 01:40:19.910
And that actually
precisely is tau

01:40:19.910 --> 01:40:23.000
equal to 2 pi, which would
define the angular coordinates.

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:27.240
If you follow that,
then that equals 1

01:40:27.240 --> 01:40:30.790
into precisely one period
of the light ray traveling.

01:40:30.790 --> 01:40:31.370
OK?

01:40:31.370 --> 01:40:35.150
But the key thing is that the
light ray will travel pi over 2

01:40:35.150 --> 01:40:38.044
to the boundary.

01:40:38.044 --> 01:40:38.960
And now you can check.

01:40:38.960 --> 01:40:42.510
If you look at--
not the light ray.

01:40:42.510 --> 01:40:45.750
So light ray travels along
the light magnitude axis.

01:40:45.750 --> 01:40:47.910
But if you look at the
time magnitude axis,

01:40:47.910 --> 01:40:50.995
which is travelled
by massive particle,

01:40:50.995 --> 01:40:53.540
then you can show that the
massive particle never reach

01:40:53.540 --> 01:40:54.960
the boundary.

01:40:54.960 --> 01:40:59.174
We'll go into a
motion like this.

01:40:59.174 --> 01:41:00.632
OK?

01:41:00.632 --> 01:41:02.090
So this is a massive particle.

01:41:09.380 --> 01:41:13.890
So the massive particle will
never reach the boundary.

01:41:13.890 --> 01:41:19.550
It will always be
reflected back intuitively,

01:41:19.550 --> 01:41:22.770
from the gravity potential.

01:41:22.770 --> 01:41:23.420
OK?

01:41:23.420 --> 01:41:25.770
So you will show
this fact yourself.

01:41:25.770 --> 01:41:29.380
And your P-set show that
actually the massive particle

01:41:29.380 --> 01:41:32.790
will never reach the boundary.

01:41:32.790 --> 01:41:42.460
So in a sense, so if you
look at this metric, at rho

01:41:42.460 --> 01:41:48.520
equal to 0, at rho equal
to 0, this is essentially

01:41:48.520 --> 01:41:49.350
like a flat metric.

01:41:49.350 --> 01:41:52.530
Because at rho equal to
0, this is just a sphere.

01:41:52.530 --> 01:41:53.390
So this becomes 1.

01:41:53.390 --> 01:41:55.950
This is a sphere.

01:41:55.950 --> 01:41:57.450
Yeah.

01:41:57.450 --> 01:41:58.290
Yeah.

01:41:58.290 --> 01:42:02.630
Rho equal to 0, this is
just like Euclidian space.

01:42:02.630 --> 01:42:05.340
Because the sine of rho
squared become rho squared.

01:42:05.340 --> 01:42:05.840
OK?

01:42:05.840 --> 01:42:08.590
So this just becomes
like a Euclidian space

01:42:08.590 --> 01:42:09.850
in polar coordinates.

01:42:09.850 --> 01:42:11.290
And then you have a time.

01:42:11.290 --> 01:42:13.160
And then this scale
factor becomes 1.

01:42:13.160 --> 01:42:16.080
So at rho equal to 0, just like
you have ordinary Minkowski

01:42:16.080 --> 01:42:18.080
spacetime.

01:42:18.080 --> 01:42:23.410
And then the curvature comes
in when you go to finite rho,

01:42:23.410 --> 01:42:25.786
and then those factors
become important.

01:42:25.786 --> 01:42:27.910
And then you can show--
yeah, just because of that,

01:42:27.910 --> 01:42:30.690
you can show that the massive
particle will never actually

01:42:30.690 --> 01:42:31.650
travel to the boundary.

01:42:31.650 --> 01:42:32.150
OK?

01:42:32.150 --> 01:42:33.600
Always reflected back.

01:42:33.600 --> 01:42:36.280
In some sense, you can think
that the massive particle

01:42:36.280 --> 01:42:40.060
is always pulled back by
the gravitational potential.

01:42:40.060 --> 01:42:41.130
OK?

01:42:41.130 --> 01:42:42.980
Pulled by gravitational
potential.

01:42:42.980 --> 01:42:46.590
So from a different
point of view,

01:42:46.590 --> 01:42:53.130
it's that another way to say it
is a familiar statement, which

01:42:53.130 --> 01:42:58.640
people often make and often
can give you great intuition,

01:42:58.640 --> 01:43:04.730
physical intuition in
many physical problems,

01:43:04.730 --> 01:43:08.554
is that AdS is like
a confining box.

01:43:13.970 --> 01:43:15.560
Just like a box.

01:43:15.560 --> 01:43:17.170
So things cannot escape from it.

01:43:17.170 --> 01:43:17.670
OK?

01:43:20.550 --> 01:43:21.290
OK?

01:43:21.290 --> 01:43:28.630
And in particular, the
typical curvature radius is r.

01:43:28.630 --> 01:43:31.750
So you can roughly imagine
this-- because in the center,

01:43:31.750 --> 01:43:34.020
it's like a flat space.

01:43:34.020 --> 01:43:36.980
So it's more like
a box of size r.

01:43:36.980 --> 01:43:39.680
OK?

01:43:39.680 --> 01:43:42.480
You can heuristically think
of it as a box of size r.

01:43:42.480 --> 01:43:43.590
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:43:43.590 --> 01:43:45.646
Does it have finite
or infinite volume?

01:43:45.646 --> 01:43:46.229
PROFESSOR: Hm?

01:43:46.229 --> 01:43:48.065
AUDIENCE: Does it have
finite or infinite volume?

01:43:48.065 --> 01:43:48.983
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it
has infinite volume.

01:43:48.983 --> 01:43:49.901
AUDIENCE: It's infinite volume.

01:43:49.901 --> 01:43:50.360
OK.

01:43:50.360 --> 01:43:51.026
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:43:51.026 --> 01:43:53.980
But because it's confining,
most of the particles

01:43:53.980 --> 01:43:56.033
will only see the sides r.

01:43:56.033 --> 01:43:57.366
AUDIENCE: So one other question.

01:43:57.366 --> 01:44:02.624
So is it correct to say that
it's like an antiharmonic trap?

01:44:02.624 --> 01:44:04.637
So if I'm in the space,
and I throw a ball

01:44:04.637 --> 01:44:06.762
that it's going to come
and hit me back in the head

01:44:06.762 --> 01:44:08.975
or something like that?

01:44:08.975 --> 01:44:09.600
It seems like--

01:44:09.600 --> 01:44:09.670
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:44:09.670 --> 01:44:10.253
Right, right.

01:44:10.253 --> 01:44:10.752
Yeah.

01:44:10.752 --> 01:44:11.918
AUDIENCE: It'll bounce back?

01:44:11.918 --> 01:44:12.960
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:44:12.960 --> 01:44:18.690
Yeah, actually, our own friend,
Frank Wilczek, in the '80s,

01:44:18.690 --> 01:44:22.360
have tried to use these
ideas, this feature, to say,

01:44:22.360 --> 01:44:26.580
maybe this actually
describes confinement.

01:44:26.580 --> 01:44:29.630
Because if you put [INAUDIBLE]
there, they're confined.

01:44:29.630 --> 01:44:30.130
Anyway.

01:44:33.060 --> 01:44:37.120
Yeah, but keep this
heuristic picture in mind.

01:44:37.120 --> 01:44:39.250
Because many physical
problems actually,

01:44:39.250 --> 01:44:42.260
if you think in terms of this
picture, become very intuitive.

01:44:42.260 --> 01:44:42.760
OK?

01:44:45.950 --> 01:44:48.310
OK.

01:44:48.310 --> 01:44:53.810
And often-- so you say this is
an exception for the light ray.

01:44:53.810 --> 01:44:56.775
But often, we impose
the reflecting boundary

01:44:56.775 --> 01:44:58.230
coming on the light ray.

01:44:58.230 --> 01:45:00.770
And from the light ray,
this is also like a box.

01:45:00.770 --> 01:45:04.710
And you go to the boundary,
and you bounce back, et cetera.

01:45:04.710 --> 01:45:06.350
OK?

01:45:06.350 --> 01:45:08.050
So now let me again just say it.

01:45:08.050 --> 01:45:11.060
But you should go back
to check yourself.

01:45:11.060 --> 01:45:14.920
Now, by looking at the
relation between here--

01:45:14.920 --> 01:45:19.530
so here is a specific
relation between r and x.

01:45:19.530 --> 01:45:23.550
And here is a specific
relation between this

01:45:23.550 --> 01:45:27.160
x and this tau and this r.

01:45:27.160 --> 01:45:29.630
You can find the relation
between this Poincare

01:45:29.630 --> 01:45:32.940
coordinate and this
global coordinate.

01:45:32.940 --> 01:45:33.940
OK?

01:45:33.940 --> 01:45:35.490
Use a little bit effort.

01:45:35.490 --> 01:45:42.370
And then you can show yourself--
let me just draw the picture.

01:45:42.370 --> 01:45:43.932
Again, using the same picture.

01:45:51.520 --> 01:45:55.520
You can show that the Poincare
patch cover a wedge-- say

01:45:55.520 --> 01:45:58.790
in this cross section.

01:45:58.790 --> 01:46:06.100
The Poincare patch cover a cross
section of this global AdS.

01:46:06.100 --> 01:46:06.880
OK?

01:46:06.880 --> 01:46:12.130
So here is tau
equal to minus pi.

01:46:12.130 --> 01:46:14.970
And here is tau
equal to plus pi.

01:46:14.970 --> 01:46:20.310
And here, say tau equal to 0.

01:46:20.310 --> 01:46:26.530
And in this Poincare patch-- and
then this 9 become r equal to 0

01:46:26.530 --> 01:46:29.070
and t equal to minus infinity.

01:46:29.070 --> 01:46:34.980
And this line become r equal
to 0 and t plus infinity.

01:46:34.980 --> 01:46:35.480
OK?

01:46:35.480 --> 01:46:36.450
Plus infinity.

01:46:39.310 --> 01:46:42.730
So the time essentially
goes around like this.

01:46:42.730 --> 01:46:44.180
Time goes around like this.

01:46:44.180 --> 01:46:47.584
And this line
equals t equal to 0.

01:46:47.584 --> 01:46:48.360
OK?

01:46:48.360 --> 01:46:49.830
So t equal to 0
and tau equal to 0

01:46:49.830 --> 01:46:52.290
coincides, and then goes
to minus infinity rotating

01:46:52.290 --> 01:46:54.240
into that.

01:46:54.240 --> 01:46:58.866
And the constant r
surface-- so this

01:46:58.866 --> 01:47:05.260
is a constant r surface in
the Poincare coordaintes--

01:47:05.260 --> 01:47:06.030
goes like this.

01:47:06.030 --> 01:47:08.100
So the time goes up.

01:47:08.100 --> 01:47:09.580
OK?

01:47:09.580 --> 01:47:11.880
And you can check yourself
just by working out

01:47:11.880 --> 01:47:15.980
the relation between those
coordinates through the x.

01:47:15.980 --> 01:47:19.430
AUDIENCE: You mean this is
wrapped on the cylinder?

01:47:19.430 --> 01:47:20.530
PROFESSOR: No, no, no.

01:47:20.530 --> 01:47:22.010
No, I'm just saying--

01:47:22.010 --> 01:47:24.140
AUDIENCE: This picture?

01:47:24.140 --> 01:47:26.060
PROFESSOR: Just within
this cross section,

01:47:26.060 --> 01:47:28.320
I can look at this
cross section,

01:47:28.320 --> 01:47:31.059
I see how this translates
into Poincare coordinates.

01:47:31.059 --> 01:47:32.225
And that's what's happening.

01:47:32.225 --> 01:47:35.140
A Poincare coordinate
covers this part.

01:47:35.140 --> 01:47:36.740
OK?

01:47:36.740 --> 01:47:38.225
It cover this part.

01:47:38.225 --> 01:47:42.310
I can also draw a more
fancy picture here.

01:47:42.310 --> 01:47:45.820
Then roughly, what
you can show is

01:47:45.820 --> 01:47:51.200
that in this general
picture, the Poincare patch

01:47:51.200 --> 01:47:53.740
covers something like this.

01:47:53.740 --> 01:47:54.350
OK?

01:47:54.350 --> 01:47:57.740
And the region between
these two lines.

01:47:57.740 --> 01:48:05.480
So this is a spacial infinity
of the-- in this Poincare patch,

01:48:05.480 --> 01:48:07.160
the boundary is
Minkowski spacetime.

01:48:15.040 --> 01:48:20.000
So you see-- so the Poincare
patch cover like that.

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.270
And then this is
a spatial infinity

01:48:22.270 --> 01:48:23.880
over the Minkowski spacetime.

01:48:23.880 --> 01:48:27.590
This is times infinity and
times a path in the Minkowski

01:48:27.590 --> 01:48:28.650
spacetime.

01:48:28.650 --> 01:48:29.290
OK?

01:48:29.290 --> 01:48:32.787
So I urge use to do it yourself.

01:48:32.787 --> 01:48:34.370
Because this kind
of thing, you really

01:48:34.370 --> 01:48:38.470
have to work through yourself to
have intuitive feeling for it.

01:48:38.470 --> 01:48:41.310
But this the picture.

01:48:41.310 --> 01:48:43.970
Once you work hard yourself,
you compare with my picture,

01:48:43.970 --> 01:48:45.290
and then you will understand.

01:48:45.290 --> 01:48:47.700
OK?

01:48:47.700 --> 01:48:50.190
So I will stop here today.

01:48:50.190 --> 01:48:54.430
So in some sense-- yeah, let
me just say one more sentence.

01:48:54.430 --> 01:48:58.110
This extended ideas
contain infinite copies

01:48:58.110 --> 01:48:59.910
of this Poincare patch.

01:48:59.910 --> 01:49:01.460
OK?
