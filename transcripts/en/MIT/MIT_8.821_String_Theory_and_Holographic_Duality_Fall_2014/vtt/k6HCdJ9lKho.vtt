at ocw.mit.edu.

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:27.310
HONG LIU: So last time, we
talked about-- we introduced

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.950
the concept of D-branes.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:34.720
And then we quantized open
strings on the D-branes.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:40.880
And we see the massive
spectrum on the D-branes

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.520
includes, say,
massless gauge field,

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.030
and also some massless
scalar fields.

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:58.030
And then I described
that one can interpolate

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:59.770
the dynamics of
the scalar fields

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.500
actually as the motion
of the D-branes.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.860
So in other words,
at the beginning,

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.700
even when we quantize
the open string,

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.230
we started with a rigid
boundary condition,

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:13.550
so we started with a rigid ring.

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:19.470
But now, after you quantize it,
then you get the fluctuations.

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.291
And because of
those fluctuations,

00:01:21.291 --> 00:01:22.540
the D-branes become dynamical.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.000
Those fluctuations
of the D-branes

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.750
make it into a dynamic
object in principle

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.140
to make it move, or et cetera.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.630
So now let's say a
little bit regarding

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.120
the math of a D-brane.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.680
In the gravitational
theory, anything gravitates.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.080
D-brane will have energy.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.440
It will have a mass, et cetera.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.210
so let's talk about what
should be the mass of a D-brane

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:51.435
if it's a dynamic object.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.340
So here, there's a very
simple and intuitive answer.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:18.450
So on the D-brane, there
are many open strings.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.600
In principle, there
are an infinite number

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.970
of open string excitations
live on the D-brane.

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.750
And each of them can
be considered, say,

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.070
as a space time field living
on the D-brane, et cetera.

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:42.990
So actual definition for
the mass of a D-brane

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:48.010
is that this should be the
energy of a D-brane, which

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.930
essentially should be the ground
state, the energy of the ground

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.280
state of the D-brane.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.220
The energy of the ground
state of a D-brane

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.150
could be corresponding to the
energy of the D-brane none

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.300
of those strings are excited.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:08.656
That should correspond
to the vacuum energy

00:03:08.656 --> 00:03:17.006
of open strings living on it.

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.440
So this is very
intuitive definition

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.520
and obviously makes sense.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.800
So we can write the mass
of a D-brane, DP-brane,

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.890
as the tension, which
is the mass per unit

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.490
volume times the total volume.

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:45.080
And this should be
equal to the vacuum

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.590
energy of all the open strings.

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.170
So say each open string
excitation corresponding

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.680
to a field.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:56.785
You have a tachyon.

00:03:56.785 --> 00:03:58.196
You have gauge field.

00:03:58.196 --> 00:03:59.820
You have massive
scalar field, and also

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.420
infinite number
of massive fields.

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.460
All those fields, they
have vacuum energy.

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:07.235
So you need to sum
all of them together.

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.400
The sum of those
vacuum energies would

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.174
be the mass of the D-brane.

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.560
So this can be achieved
just by doing the vacuum

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.980
diagram of open strings.

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.660
So we describe in the
closed stream case,

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.340
if you want to find the vacuum
energy in the closed string,

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:34.010
you just sum of all possible.

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:35.910
So this will be just
the vacuum diagram.

00:04:51.036 --> 00:04:54.580
In other words,
so the difference

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.840
between the open string is
that open strings have boundary

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.810
and closed strings are closed.

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:14.450
So that means the sum of
all two dimensional surfaces

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:32.610
with this one boundaries but
no external open strings.

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:40.180
This is the natural definition
of the vacuum diagram,

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.860
as we would do.

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:44.890
And we will do in the
Euclidean path integral.

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:47.222
So you can do this in the
Euclidean path integral.

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:56.480
You sum over all surfaces.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:00.770
In the case when you need
the sum of all surfaces,

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:03.460
in some sense, the only way we
know how to define such a sum

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.270
is to do the Euclidean
path integral.

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:21.820
And this sum-- so previously,
we talked about the vacuum

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:24.280
energy of the closed
stream, the sum

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:30.150
of all possible closed surfaces,
say of different topology.

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:33.070
So here, again, you sum
of all possible surfaces

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:35.160
with this one boundaries.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.766
So the simplest surface
with one boundary is a disk.

00:06:41.446 --> 00:06:43.070
The difference with
closed string case,

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:46.960
now you have to sum over
surfaces with boundaries.

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.518
So the simplest one
would be a disk.

00:06:49.518 --> 00:06:53.025
And the next would be annulus.

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:01.196
Now you have two boundaries
rather than one boundary.

00:07:01.196 --> 00:07:03.445
And exactly you can consider
more and more complicated

00:07:03.445 --> 00:07:04.169
diagrams.

00:07:04.169 --> 00:07:06.335
You can consider more and
more complicated diagrams.

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:13.410
And the way to weight those
surfaces exactly the same

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:17.970
as before is that you
have this g string

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:20.065
than to the power
minus chi, and the chi

00:07:20.065 --> 00:07:24.860
is the Euler number, just
exactly as we described before.

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:29.740
And Euler number now to apply
surfaces with boundaries

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:33.524
would be-- so previously,
Euler number is 2 minus 2h.

00:07:33.524 --> 00:07:39.279
h is number of genuses,
or number of holes.

00:07:39.279 --> 00:07:41.695
But now you also need to include
the number of boundaries,

00:07:41.695 --> 00:07:44.660
which are called b.

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:46.190
So when you include
the boundaries,

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:48.890
then that will change
your Euler number,

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:53.150
and also change the
weight for each diagram.

00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:58.140
You can also add handles here.

00:07:58.140 --> 00:07:59.760
You can also add handles here.

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:01.755
You can also add
genuses to the disk.

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:07.030
You can also add h here.

00:08:10.114 --> 00:08:11.780
So according to this
counting, then this

00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:13.900
would count as gs minus 1.

00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:21.200
So this one has zero
holes and one boundaries.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.740
So this is 2 minus 1.

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:23.840
So this is 1.

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:26.840
So this is gs to the
power negative 1.

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:30.350
And this one has low
hole but two boundaries.

00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:31.680
2 minus 2 is 0.

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:35.990
This is 1 to the
power gs to the 0.

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:38.230
And then you have
higher diagrams.

00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:43.409
You have higher surfaces
with all positive powers, gs.

00:08:43.409 --> 00:08:44.344
Yes?

00:08:44.344 --> 00:08:46.044
AUDIENCE: What about
like a Mobius strip

00:08:46.044 --> 00:08:46.960
that has one boundary?

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:48.020
HONG LIU: Right.

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:50.480
So the Mobius strip is
a very good question.

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:53.320
A Mobius strip is
unoriented surface.

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:55.890
So here, we can see
the oriented string.

00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:59.750
You can consider
unoriented string.

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:04.120
But most of what we said
applies to that case.

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:06.900
It's just we have to worry a
little bit about orientation,

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:08.520
so we don't go there.

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:10.330
AUDIENCE: Will that
really contribute

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:12.089
to the vector [INAUDIBLE]?

00:09:12.089 --> 00:09:12.630
HONG LIU: Hm?

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:16.240
AUDIENCE: Will the Mobius
strip contribute to the--

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:17.580
HONG LIU: Yeah, yeah, it will.

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:24.880
In the case when you
have unoriented string.

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:27.750
AUDIENCE: But you make
a restriction and say,

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:31.985
on this D-brane, we have
or not have unoriented--

00:09:31.985 --> 00:09:34.110
HONG LIU: Here, we only
consider oriented surfaces.

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:35.860
We only consider
oriented strings.

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:39.940
We have not talked about
unoriented strings.

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:42.610
AUDIENCE: But no
restriction in principle.

00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:43.360
HONG LIU: You can.

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:48.750
It's actually a
technical complication

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:51.454
I don't want to
go into right now.

00:09:51.454 --> 00:09:52.340
Yes?

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:54.960
AUDIENCE: So we think of
vertical axis as time.

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:57.062
So the disk would
be a string kind

00:09:57.062 --> 00:09:58.760
of nucleating and propagating--

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:00.720
HONG LIU: No.

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.820
This is a Euclidean and
you can think of time

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:04.214
as whatever you want.

00:10:04.214 --> 00:10:04.880
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:07.540
But still, so the disk would be
like a nucleating open string

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:10.300
that propagates and
then disappears, right?

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:12.340
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:14.530
For example, this open
string you can consider.

00:10:19.386 --> 00:10:21.010
Heuristically, you
may be able to think

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:26.025
of some kind of a single string,
just rotate, for example.

00:10:26.025 --> 00:10:27.875
AUDIENCE: Like forever?

00:10:27.875 --> 00:10:28.500
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:30.180
For example, I
just said a single.

00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:33.620
I'm just saying it's hard
to interpret as a time now.

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:37.489
But the time in this direction
would be periodic time

00:10:37.489 --> 00:10:39.030
if you think from
that point of view.

00:10:42.862 --> 00:10:44.320
But the good thing
is that when you

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:50.700
go to Euclidean, what you call
time and the spatial direction

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:53.330
then becomes obscured.

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:54.640
It depends on your convenience.

00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:00.989
AUDIENCE: In the
center, is that a genus?

00:11:00.989 --> 00:11:01.530
HONG LIU: No.

00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:05.515
The center is completely smooth.

00:11:05.515 --> 00:11:07.339
AUDIENCE: It's not like a torus?

00:11:07.339 --> 00:11:07.880
HONG LIU: No.

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:09.010
A disk is a disk.

00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:11.120
A disk is not a torus.

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:13.000
AUDIENCE: But there's a--

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.740
HONG LIU: You're
talking about this one?

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:15.365
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:11:15.365 --> 00:11:16.570
HONG LIU: Oh.

00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:19.630
This one is annulus.

00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:20.620
This guy is annulus.

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:21.645
This is a flat surface.

00:11:24.255 --> 00:11:26.590
AUDIENCE: So the inside
and outside are the--

00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:27.865
HONG LIU: They are different.

00:11:27.865 --> 00:11:31.330
If you identify this and that,
then they become a torus.

00:11:36.154 --> 00:11:37.820
When you identify
this one and that one,

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:39.985
then they become a torus.

00:11:39.985 --> 00:11:41.617
Then you get rid
of the boundaries.

00:11:41.617 --> 00:11:43.950
When you identify them, then
there's no boundary anymore

00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:45.935
because they become a circle.

00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:51.810
Good?

00:11:51.810 --> 00:12:01.110
So that means if I have
weak coupling, that

00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:05.920
means when gs is much smaller
than 1, which is the cases we

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:09.420
can only consider because if
you have gs more than 1, then

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:11.620
you have some infinite
number of diagrams.

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:15.590
And we don't know how
to deal with this.

00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:20.840
So weak coupling, when gs more
than 1, then the brane tension,

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:25.360
then the D-brane
will be always scaled

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:28.510
with string coupling at 1
over gs because of that,

00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:32.390
because this term will dominate.

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:33.880
This term will dominate.

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:35.630
And then the energy
should be 1 over gs.

00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:45.060
This is a very important result.
It's a very important result.

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:48.170
The mass of the D-brane
is actually 1 over gs.

00:12:52.010 --> 00:13:03.680
So on dimensional ground, you
can just essentially write down

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:06.180
what's the tension
of the D-brane

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:08.765
because the only dimensional
parameter is alpha prime.

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:13.250
So the dimension of
the D-brane should

00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:18.160
be-- so this is mass
per unit volume.

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:20.780
So you have a p
dimension of volume, then

00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:22.830
that would be p plus 1.

00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:26.900
So the mass dimension of the
tension would be p plus 1.

00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:30.045
So just on dimension
ground, I can write gs

00:13:30.045 --> 00:13:37.000
because it's 1 over s,
alpha prime 1/2 p plus 1.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.940
So that gives you
the right dimension.

00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:43.210
And then you can have
some numerical constant

00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:46.106
which you need to determine.

00:13:46.106 --> 00:13:54.500
You have some numerical
constant which

00:13:54.500 --> 00:14:01.871
you can determine string theory
by doing that path integral.

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:06.880
Any questions about this?

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:07.839
Yes?

00:14:07.839 --> 00:14:10.284
AUDIENCE: Do these open
string vacuum diagrams

00:14:10.284 --> 00:14:12.718
have any interpretations
like half of a closed string

00:14:12.718 --> 00:14:13.218
diagram?

00:14:13.218 --> 00:14:15.180
So if you put two disks
together, you have a sphere.

00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:15.910
HONG LIU: Right.

00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:18.950
We will talk about
this in a minute.

00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:19.742
Yes?

00:14:19.742 --> 00:14:22.700
AUDIENCE: With the
logical decomposition

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:26.080
of the powers of g, why
is the disk g minus 1.

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:30.155
HONG LIU: This comes
from this formula.

00:14:30.155 --> 00:14:33.760
As we discussed before, the
weight of different topology

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:38.820
is always weighted by some
constant to the power of Euler

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:40.060
number.

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:42.560
Now, the Euler number, if you
have surfaces with boundaries,

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:46.910
then the Euler number depends
on the number of boundaries.

00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:48.990
And then you can
just work it out.

00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:55.650
So this is based
on simple topology.

00:14:55.650 --> 00:14:58.316
Any other questions?

00:14:58.316 --> 00:14:58.815
Yes?

00:14:58.815 --> 00:14:59.560
AUDIENCE: I'm sorry.

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:01.809
I'm just a little bit confused
about the vacuum energy

00:15:01.809 --> 00:15:05.200
here as the one-- remember
when you calculate

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:06.421
the mass of the string.

00:15:06.421 --> 00:15:08.480
You know, we have a
naught term there.

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:11.234
There is no excitation.

00:15:11.234 --> 00:15:11.900
HONG LIU: Sorry.

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:12.441
Say it again.

00:15:12.441 --> 00:15:15.125
AUDIENCE: So when we calculate
the mass of the open string

00:15:15.125 --> 00:15:18.030
and there is a0 term, which
is completely different.

00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:20.680
HONG LIU: That's
completely different.

00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:25.270
So that a0, we
considered before, it's

00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:27.770
the zero point energy
for the oscillation

00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:29.510
modes on the screen.

00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:37.740
So that a0 is that
we are considering

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:45.300
this string, and the zero point
energy for the oscillation

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:47.200
mode on this string.

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:49.770
But here, we are
considering the zero point

00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:50.970
energy not of the string.

00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:54.790
We are considering the zero
point energy of the D-brane.

00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:56.820
And the zero point
energy of the D-brane

00:15:56.820 --> 00:16:01.760
would be to write down the
vacuum energy of all the fields

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:03.350
living on the D-brane.

00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:05.700
And all the fields living
on the D-brane corresponding

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:09.600
to all the-- now,
each string excitation

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:11.390
becomes a field on the D-brane.

00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:13.540
And so that's corresponding
to sum of that.

00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:15.280
And that, then, in
turn corresponding

00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:16.795
to sum of these
kind of surfaces.

00:16:19.896 --> 00:16:21.380
Any other questions?

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:26.230
So there's an
alternative way to think

00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:30.115
about how to compute
the D-brane mass

00:16:30.115 --> 00:16:38.960
or energy as follows, which is
actually extremely instructive.

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:40.985
There is an alternative
way of doing this.

00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:50.280
So let's consider just D-brane.

00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:57.060
So consider the interaction
between the two D-branes.

00:16:57.060 --> 00:17:00.580
So let's consider two D-branes
separated by some distance.

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:08.838
And then they have a mass.

00:17:08.838 --> 00:17:13.126
Then they will interact
gravitationally.

00:17:13.126 --> 00:17:14.750
In particular, in a
weak coupling limit

00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:16.490
they're pretty massive.

00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:19.650
They're very massive because
it's 1 over the g string.

00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:24.670
So when g string is small,
which is the only regime

00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:26.890
we're working with, so
the D-brane is very heavy.

00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:31.970
And so you can ask, what is
the gravitational attraction

00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:33.830
between the two?

00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:37.170
What is the interaction
between the two?

00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:41.960
And we know that
at low energies,

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:44.170
say if the two D-branes
are not excited,

00:17:44.170 --> 00:17:48.400
if their distance
are very far apart,

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:51.770
then the leading
interaction between them

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:53.710
just comes from
the massless mode

00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:57.540
because only massless mode
mediates normal interactions.

00:17:57.540 --> 00:18:00.210
And so interaction
between them just

00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:06.630
comes from graviton
or this [INAUDIBLE],

00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:11.040
essentially just corresponding
to small number of massless

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:12.540
closed string modes.

00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:14.650
Only those massless
modes will contribute

00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:16.410
because the massive mode
only contributes short range

00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:16.951
interactions.

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:25.540
AUDIENCE: Why not the
vector mode in open string?

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:27.660
HONG LIU: No.

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:30.740
Vector mode of open string
only lives on each brane.

00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:34.960
AUDIENCE: But we can have
an open string like--

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:37.500
HONG LIU: I will talk
about that separately.

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:38.480
Just wait a little bit.

00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:45.154
So if I think purely from
the alternative gravity

00:18:45.154 --> 00:18:47.320
point of view, not from
string theory point of view,

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:50.310
I have two massive objects.

00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:53.060
I want to look at the
interaction between them.

00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:58.350
And then interaction will
be proportional to gn,

00:18:58.350 --> 00:19:00.920
say their mass.

00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:04.312
So if I factor out
the volume factor,

00:19:04.312 --> 00:19:08.030
it would be just GN TP squared.

00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:10.694
So this essentially is the
gravitational interaction

00:19:10.694 --> 00:19:11.360
between the two.

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:16.230
And from the string
theory point of view,

00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:17.740
such a diagram
corresponding to you

00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:19.580
exchange your closed string.

00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:27.380
So this diagram
corresponding says,

00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:29.370
suppose you have
brane one, brane two.

00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:37.950
So this picture that brane
one will emit graviton

00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:39.940
absorbed by the other brane.

00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:45.440
And then that's how we
measure, say, the newtons

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:49.000
force between them.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.500
And it translates to the
string theory picture.

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:56.150
This corresponding to one
D-brane emits a closed string,

00:19:56.150 --> 00:20:00.689
and then absorbed by
the other D-brane.

00:20:00.689 --> 00:20:02.230
And when you go to
[INAUDIBLE], which

00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:05.310
only massless mode matters,
and then becomes this picture.

00:20:08.272 --> 00:20:10.480
So this is the string theory
version of that diagram.

00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:17.330
So now essentially,
what you need

00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:21.790
to do to calculate this
thing in the string theory

00:20:21.790 --> 00:20:26.110
is to calculate this
thing in the diagram.

00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:29.270
So form the string
theory point of view,

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:39.205
now what you need to consider
is to do path integral

00:20:39.205 --> 00:20:43.220
on the topology of
a cylinder with one

00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:46.420
boundary on the brane one
and the other boundary

00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:47.040
on brane two.

00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:54.560
So this corresponds to
exchange of a closed

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:56.350
string in this direction.

00:21:03.299 --> 00:21:04.090
AUDIENCE: Question.

00:21:04.090 --> 00:21:06.860
HONG LIU: Yes?

00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:09.240
AUDIENCE: What's the mechanism
for the D-brane emitting

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:10.440
a closed string?

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:13.960
Or equivalently, on
the other picture,

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:16.500
why can it emit a graviton?

00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:18.830
HONG LIU: It's
coupled to graviton.

00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:21.469
AUDIENCE: So how did we
introduce the coupling?

00:21:21.469 --> 00:21:22.010
HONG LIU: Hm?

00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:23.130
AUDIENCE: How did we
introduce the coupling?

00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:24.740
I mean, we introduced them
as boundary conditions

00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:25.620
for open strings.

00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:26.570
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:29.445
AUDIENCE: So does that
naturally introduce coupling?

00:21:29.445 --> 00:21:30.320
HONG LIU: No, no, no.

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:32.410
This is what I'm writing here.

00:21:32.410 --> 00:21:36.040
And this diagram, you emit from
a closed string corresponding

00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:38.950
to look at the cylinder.

00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:47.390
One boundary of the cylinder on
the location with one D-brane,

00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:49.680
and the other boundary of
the cylinder on the location

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:51.140
of the other D-brane.

00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:54.290
And then you just integrate
over this surface.

00:21:54.290 --> 00:22:00.235
And then that will give
you the graviton exchange.

00:22:00.235 --> 00:22:01.735
That will give you
the closed string

00:22:01.735 --> 00:22:03.254
exchange between the two.

00:22:03.254 --> 00:22:05.920
AUDIENCE: So the coupling of the
closed string to the brane kind

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:07.860
of naturally arises?

00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:10.860
HONG LIU: In the boundary
condition imposed here.

00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:17.630
So you impose this closed
string to initiate it

00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:20.260
from-- so you impose the
boundary condition here

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:25.140
so that this closed string
starts from brane one

00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:27.440
and then ends on brane two.

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:30.200
And then you integrate
over all surfaces

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:31.880
this cylinder topology.

00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:36.690
AUDIENCE: We know the
interaction constant

00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:41.620
for closed string is g closed,
but is it the same here?

00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:42.390
HONG LIU: No.

00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:45.427
That's what I'm
going to talk about.

00:22:45.427 --> 00:22:46.010
Is this clear?

00:22:49.090 --> 00:22:49.590
OK.

00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:52.080
So now I'm going to
mention two things.

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:54.340
First, as I said
before, whenever

00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:57.850
we do some calculations, we
often do analytic integration

00:22:57.850 --> 00:23:00.420
to the Euclidean signature.

00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:04.240
So now it will be the same.

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:08.550
When we do this calculation,
we have a closed string start

00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:11.610
at location of the brane
one, and move forward

00:23:11.610 --> 00:23:14.740
in time to end on the brane two.

00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:17.130
So this is the simplest diagram.

00:23:17.130 --> 00:23:20.660
You can also add
some holes here.

00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:22.390
You can also add
some holes here.

00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:25.110
And then that corresponds to
higher order diagram structure.

00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:27.650
So now don't worry about that.

00:23:27.650 --> 00:23:29.030
Just the simplest diagram.

00:23:29.030 --> 00:23:29.998
Yes?

00:23:29.998 --> 00:23:34.260
AUDIENCE: Was it time
dimension inside brane

00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:37.592
to define time dimension
as one of the dimensions

00:23:37.592 --> 00:23:39.083
that lived inside brane?

00:23:39.083 --> 00:23:40.080
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:46.280
But this is not a
space time [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:48.380
This is virtual time.

00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:52.590
This is virtual time
associated with this graviton.

00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:55.740
So essentially, I do create
the closed string here

00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:58.670
on this brane and then
propagate then absorbed

00:23:58.670 --> 00:24:00.370
by the other D-brane.

00:24:03.150 --> 00:24:04.900
AUDIENCE: Can you also
think about this as

00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:06.180
like an open string--

00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:07.440
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:09.330
One second.

00:24:09.330 --> 00:24:10.230
I'm going to explain.

00:24:14.130 --> 00:24:18.200
So now there are two remarkable
things about this diagram.

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:20.270
The two remarkable things
about this diagram.

00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:24.640
First, this is a
cylinder diagram.

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:27.476
And this is a diagram
with two boundaries

00:24:27.476 --> 00:24:31.180
because we have to emit a
closed string from here.

00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:32.520
And so you have one boundary.

00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:34.250
You have an initial
closed string,

00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:36.260
then you have a
final closed string.

00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:41.148
So this is a surface with
two boundaries with no holes.

00:24:41.148 --> 00:24:45.190
And if you calculate the
chi, so this would be zero.

00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:51.190
Then that means this
diagram is gs to power of 0.

00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:53.779
And then from here,
we know that then

00:24:53.779 --> 00:24:55.320
this from string
theory point of view

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:57.400
will be gs to the power of 0.

00:24:57.400 --> 00:25:01.050
And so this is another way
to see that the TP should

00:25:01.050 --> 00:25:03.096
be 1 over g string.

00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:11.990
Because we said before
that the G Newton--

00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:14.690
so we explained before G Newton
would be order of gs squared.

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:22.470
G Newton is the
g string squared.

00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:25.374
So do you remember G
Newton is g string squared?

00:25:25.374 --> 00:25:25.874
Good.

00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:34.860
But something remarkable
about this diagram

00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:37.870
is that you can also
view this diagram.

00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:40.229
So right now, we see
it from this direction.

00:25:40.229 --> 00:25:42.270
Now we can also view it
from the other direction.

00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:49.035
Viewed from this
direction, so now

00:25:49.035 --> 00:25:50.410
try to think about
this direction

00:25:50.410 --> 00:25:56.160
as the time and this
direction as the sigma.

00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:59.770
So right now, we are
seeing this as virtual time

00:25:59.770 --> 00:26:01.860
and this as sigma.

00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:04.990
This is a closed string.

00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:09.860
So now think about
this direction as sigma

00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:12.180
and this direction as time.

00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:19.260
And then this is an open
string with one end ending

00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:24.160
on brane two and the other
end ending on brane one,

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:27.440
and then going in the loop.

00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:29.600
So this is the one
loop open string.

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:31.350
So even though this
is tree-level exchange

00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:33.270
in closed string.

00:26:33.270 --> 00:26:36.910
So here is the tree-level
exchange in closed string.

00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:50.130
So here is one loop
in open string.

00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:57.875
So this tells you
the same process.

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:03.760
You can really view it
from two perspectives.

00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:12.810
From one perspective, it's
the standard point of view,

00:27:12.810 --> 00:27:16.280
is that we exchange
some closed strings.

00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:19.440
So we exchange some gravitons,
some massless particles,

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:22.240
some particles
between these two.

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:29.220
But there's another way to
think about it is we say,

00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:32.514
because we have
two D-branes here

00:27:32.514 --> 00:27:34.930
and because D-branes correspond
in two places, open string

00:27:34.930 --> 00:27:44.940
can end, then I have open
string connect between them.

00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:47.650
And this one loop open
string is essentially

00:27:47.650 --> 00:27:51.745
corresponding to the vacuum
diagram of those open strings

00:27:51.745 --> 00:27:53.775
connect between them.

00:27:53.775 --> 00:27:55.150
So when you add
the vacuum energy

00:27:55.150 --> 00:27:59.480
of all those open strings
ending between them,

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:02.700
then you're effectively
calculating the interaction

00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:06.770
between the two D-branes.

00:28:06.770 --> 00:28:09.730
So we have two completely
different perspectives

00:28:09.730 --> 00:28:12.970
to look at the same process.

00:28:12.970 --> 00:28:18.527
And this is very, very
deep and profound.

00:28:18.527 --> 00:28:19.235
Deep is profound.

00:28:22.510 --> 00:28:27.770
Because that means
the process that you

00:28:27.770 --> 00:28:30.340
can think from closed
string perspective

00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:34.920
can be fully understood
in a different way

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:37.400
from the open
string perspective,

00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:38.940
in a completely equivalent way.

00:28:41.636 --> 00:28:43.635
And this is normally
called the channel duality.

00:28:50.050 --> 00:28:55.200
So it's a very
simple geometric fact

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:57.320
about two dimensional surfaces.

00:28:57.320 --> 00:29:00.222
But physical significance
is very profound.

00:29:00.222 --> 00:29:01.756
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:29:01.756 --> 00:29:02.630
HONG LIU: One second.

00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:04.430
Let me finish.

00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:10.840
And this is precisely
the string theory

00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:15.140
origin of the holographic
duality or the idea, say, of t

00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:18.860
we are going to see in
a couple of lectures.

00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:23.150
Just because of this
simple geometric picture.

00:29:28.510 --> 00:29:36.610
This side is gravity, and the
D-brane is about gauge theory.

00:29:36.610 --> 00:29:42.140
And then we see gravity to be
equivalent to gauge theory.

00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:45.770
That's something we
are going to see later.

00:29:45.770 --> 00:29:48.200
Yeah?

00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:52.030
AUDIENCE: So you said the
dynamics of closed string

00:29:52.030 --> 00:29:54.880
can be fully understood
by open string.

00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:57.290
Is that why you say
it's a closed surface

00:29:57.290 --> 00:29:58.870
formed by a closed string?

00:29:58.870 --> 00:30:00.686
How can you interpret?

00:30:00.686 --> 00:30:01.310
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:03.967
I'm talking about this
particular diagram.

00:30:03.967 --> 00:30:06.050
I'm just saying this gives
you a hint of something

00:30:06.050 --> 00:30:07.272
very profound.

00:30:07.272 --> 00:30:08.480
AUDIENCE: And one more thing.

00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:11.879
Why is the gs 0?

00:30:11.879 --> 00:30:12.420
HONG LIU: No.

00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:16.290
This is the surface
of two boundaries.

00:30:16.290 --> 00:30:18.539
AUDIENCE: But that
is for open string.

00:30:18.539 --> 00:30:19.080
HONG LIU: No.

00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:21.140
Chi is for everything.

00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:22.030
Chi is everything.

00:30:22.030 --> 00:30:23.830
Doesn't matter open
or closed string.

00:30:23.830 --> 00:30:26.030
This is the universal formula.

00:30:26.030 --> 00:30:26.572
This is open.

00:30:26.572 --> 00:30:29.071
The open string just means we
imposed the boundary condition

00:30:29.071 --> 00:30:29.970
on the open string.

00:30:29.970 --> 00:30:31.600
The topology is the same.

00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:34.260
We understand the
topology is the same.

00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:34.955
Yes?

00:30:34.955 --> 00:30:36.470
AUDIENCE: Why do you
call it one loop string?

00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:36.830
Where is the loop?

00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:38.910
HONG LIU: Because this
is the open string.

00:30:38.910 --> 00:30:39.960
So this is the open.

00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:41.210
Think from this point of view.

00:30:41.210 --> 00:30:44.990
This is the open string on
brane one and brane two.

00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:48.620
And then you go around
once, go around in circle.

00:30:48.620 --> 00:30:51.905
So this is one loop.

00:30:51.905 --> 00:30:54.722
AUDIENCE: What's
the free momentum?

00:30:54.722 --> 00:30:55.680
HONG LIU: What is this?

00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:00.270
What is this?

00:31:00.270 --> 00:31:02.590
This is one loop if
you have a particle.

00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:03.670
And so you have a string.

00:31:03.670 --> 00:31:04.920
Then you go around the circle.

00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:05.950
This is one loop.

00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:14.960
And indeed, when you
sum over such surfaces,

00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:18.000
you will lead to sum of all
possible momentums, et cetera.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.520
So the field theory
momentum is one

00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:21.710
of the modes you
have to sum over

00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:25.530
when you do past integral
over surface of such topology.

00:31:25.530 --> 00:31:26.080
Yes?

00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:29.384
AUDIENCE: Once you go to strings
connecting different branes,

00:31:29.384 --> 00:31:33.380
your quantization
conditions change.

00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:34.890
HONG LIU: We will
talk about that.

00:31:34.890 --> 00:31:37.230
Quantization condition
almost does not change.

00:31:37.230 --> 00:31:39.570
We will talk about that.

00:31:39.570 --> 00:31:41.310
We'll talk about
that in a little bit.

00:31:41.310 --> 00:31:42.810
But right now, it's
just intuitively

00:31:42.810 --> 00:31:45.520
clear you have open string
connect between them

00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:47.526
and they just go around.

00:31:47.526 --> 00:31:49.275
You have open string
connect between them.

00:31:49.275 --> 00:31:51.340
You can just go
around the circle.

00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:52.765
AUDIENCE: But this
correspondence

00:31:52.765 --> 00:31:57.040
doesn't count the tree-level
around the open string.

00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:58.005
HONG LIU: Count what?

00:31:58.005 --> 00:32:02.955
AUDIENCE: If we generalize
the tree-level open string.

00:32:02.955 --> 00:32:03.830
HONG LIU: No, no, no.

00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:10.160
This doesn't have to account
for the tree-level open string.

00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:13.120
AUDIENCE: Tree-level open string
contributes to the interaction?

00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:13.661
HONG LIU: No.

00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:21.150
Here, I'm only talking
about this diagram

00:32:21.150 --> 00:32:23.410
and just say this
hints that there

00:32:23.410 --> 00:32:26.120
are certain closed string
processes can be completely

00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:27.386
described by the open string.

00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:37.100
So what want to extrapolate
is that open string

00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:39.480
is a more fundamental
description

00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:42.110
because the tree-level
diagram in closed string

00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:44.110
can be described
by the open string.

00:32:44.110 --> 00:32:47.580
And now if you can generalize
that maybe everything closed

00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:49.570
string can be described
by open string.

00:32:49.570 --> 00:32:51.660
But you don't want to
do in the opposite way.

00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:53.302
Open string is open string.

00:32:57.616 --> 00:32:58.115
Good?

00:33:00.810 --> 00:33:03.160
Any other questions?

00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:05.782
AUDIENCE: Once you
go higher dimensions,

00:33:05.782 --> 00:33:09.897
when you leave tree-level
closed string can be distinct?

00:33:09.897 --> 00:33:10.480
HONG LIU: Yes.

00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:11.771
Things become more complicated.

00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:16.800
Things become more complicated.

00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:19.720
But the similar
picture will exist.

00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:27.230
But nobody has made it work.

00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:31.000
Nobody has made it work at
full string theory level

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.740
to construct the whole
closed string theory

00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:35.110
from the open string theory.

00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:36.780
Nobody has made it work.

00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:41.870
But there are many such kind of
indications from the geometry

00:33:41.870 --> 00:33:44.053
of the surface point of view.

00:33:47.290 --> 00:33:54.314
So now let's talk about relaxing
the strength of open string

00:33:54.314 --> 00:33:54.855
interactions.

00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:10.199
Actually, before I do
that, now is a good place

00:34:10.199 --> 00:34:14.440
to go back to examine
what we discussed

00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:18.010
at the end of last lecture.

00:34:18.010 --> 00:34:23.090
Now is a good time to go back
to talk about what we did

00:34:23.090 --> 00:34:25.810
at the end of the last lecture.

00:34:25.810 --> 00:34:33.429
So in the last
lecture, at the end,

00:34:33.429 --> 00:34:35.540
we described that
one can work out

00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:38.469
the low energy effective
action of the massless modes

00:34:38.469 --> 00:34:40.320
on the D-branes.

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:42.469
So the massless modes on
the D-branes on the gauge

00:34:42.469 --> 00:34:49.159
fields along the D-brane,
so A alpha from 0, 1, to p.

00:34:49.159 --> 00:34:54.754
And then the scalar field and
a label all the perpendicular

00:34:54.754 --> 00:34:55.254
directions.

00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:08.020
So you can write down
effective action for them.

00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:12.300
I mentioned if you work
out things carefully,

00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:15.950
then you find the
prefactor is actually

00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:19.250
just the brane tension.

00:35:19.250 --> 00:35:25.590
And if last thing is
excited, p plus 1.

00:35:25.590 --> 00:35:28.690
If last thing is
excited, then you just

00:35:28.690 --> 00:35:32.390
have the vacuum energy,
so you will have a one.

00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:37.240
So this is just the brane
mass, the total brane mass.

00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:37.950
This is et.

00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:44.380
So if last thing is
excited, then you just

00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:46.180
have the zero
point energy, which

00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:50.950
is just tp times the volume.

00:35:50.950 --> 00:35:55.140
But now, if you also
have gauge field, then

00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:59.380
based on general argument,
you must have the Maxwell.

00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:03.620
And if the scalar
field is excited,

00:36:03.620 --> 00:36:13.890
then you also have the action
for massless scalar field.

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:30.760
And then we mentioned
that for example, you

00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:33.250
can consider special case.

00:36:33.250 --> 00:36:42.810
Suppose A alpha is not excited
but the brane, rather than

00:36:42.810 --> 00:36:46.010
a scalar field that
moves in a coherent way

00:36:46.010 --> 00:36:56.670
the same at all points on
the D-brane, just phi a,

00:36:56.670 --> 00:37:01.220
is a function of
t rather than x.

00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:02.165
So phi, in general.

00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:09.860
Suppose the brane
coordinates our x0 and the p.

00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:15.760
So in general, A alpha is
the function of x0, xp.

00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:20.340
And phi a is x0 and xp.

00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:22.545
So they describe you can
have arbitrary profile

00:37:22.545 --> 00:37:23.415
on the world-volume.

00:37:25.930 --> 00:37:28.910
But suppose, say, let me
consider the uniform situation

00:37:28.910 --> 00:37:35.180
which I only consider
every point has

00:37:35.180 --> 00:37:38.380
the same behavior for phi.

00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:46.130
And then this s just becomes
1/2, dt just becomes dt.

00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:57.070
And D-brane plus 1/2 and
D-brane phi dot squared.

00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:13.840
So this is precisely the motion
of just a massive object.

00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:23.120
OK And m is just this guy.

00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:26.040
So if last thing depends
on the spatial coordinate,

00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:28.190
then the integration of
the spatial coordinate

00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:29.590
becomes the volume.

00:38:29.590 --> 00:38:32.080
Combine the volume with
that, becomes the mass,

00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:33.326
and then just becomes that.

00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:43.650
I think this is minus sign.

00:38:43.650 --> 00:38:45.060
This is plus sign.

00:38:51.310 --> 00:38:53.970
So as I mentioned,
this is another way

00:38:53.970 --> 00:38:56.940
to see that the D-brane
becomes dynamical,

00:38:56.940 --> 00:38:58.690
and that in particular,
this phi describes

00:38:58.690 --> 00:38:59.773
the motion of the D-brane.

00:39:05.370 --> 00:39:11.170
So in fact, this result can
be much, much strengthened.

00:39:11.170 --> 00:39:15.140
But I will only
quote the result.

00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:18.440
I will only quote the result.

00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:28.520
It turns out for
D-brane with constant.

00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:35.170
So as opposed to the D-brane
move with constant velocity,

00:39:35.170 --> 00:39:38.020
so now you can
also have a motion

00:39:38.020 --> 00:39:40.560
in the spatial direction.

00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:45.855
You have a constant of
this and F alpha beta.

00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:51.180
You can also excite
the gauge field,

00:39:51.180 --> 00:39:52.685
but the field
strength is constant.

00:39:55.950 --> 00:40:00.010
Or this quantity is small.

00:40:00.010 --> 00:40:01.980
They don't have to
be strictly constant,

00:40:01.980 --> 00:40:05.110
but at least their
derivatives are small.

00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:16.120
In such a situation,
one can actually

00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:22.650
sum all the higher order terms
from string theory corrections.

00:40:22.650 --> 00:40:25.420
So this is just a low energy,
just like field theory.

00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:28.850
And in such a situation,
you can actually

00:40:28.850 --> 00:40:32.160
sum over infinite number
of higher order terms.

00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:33.110
And what do you find?

00:40:33.110 --> 00:40:35.700
You find so-called wave sum
of all infinite number higher

00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:37.560
terms.

00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:39.720
You find so-called
Dirac-Born-Infeld action.

00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:45.590
You find that this effective
action becomes like this.

00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:55.327
This is very [INAUDIBLE] result.
So I just want to mention it.

00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:15.710
You can actually
sum into this form.

00:41:15.710 --> 00:41:20.200
So you can sum into this form.

00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:25.925
And this g alpha beta
is the [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:49.524
So let me just explain
a little bit the physics

00:41:49.524 --> 00:41:50.190
of this formula.

00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:05.050
So let's consider
the case of the phi

00:42:05.050 --> 00:42:07.660
is not excited at all,
just phi for the constant,

00:42:07.660 --> 00:42:08.760
say, for example.

00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:10.620
Then this term vanishes.

00:42:10.620 --> 00:42:15.630
Then this g alpha beta just
becomes eta alpha beta.

00:42:15.630 --> 00:42:17.750
And now you just
have a square root,

00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:21.430
say, your Minkowski
metric plus F alpha beta.

00:42:21.430 --> 00:42:24.580
Forget about this
2 pi alpha prime.

00:42:24.580 --> 00:42:27.310
This is just some
dimensional factor.

00:42:27.310 --> 00:42:30.910
And then you just have eta
alpha beta plus F alpha beta.

00:42:30.910 --> 00:42:34.370
And then you write
the determinant.

00:42:34.370 --> 00:42:38.700
And suppose when F alpha beta is
small, when alpha prime times F

00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:41.005
alpha beta is small,
then you can expand it

00:42:41.005 --> 00:42:44.440
in powers of F alpha beta.

00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:48.800
It's a simple exercise
but instructive exercise.

00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:55.050
You see that precisely
reproduces the Maxwell term.

00:42:55.050 --> 00:42:58.540
But this will give rise
to higher nonlinear terms.

00:42:58.540 --> 00:43:02.060
There will be higher
order nonlinear terms.

00:43:02.060 --> 00:43:05.800
So this can be considered as
a nonlinear generalization

00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:08.494
of the Maxwell theory.

00:43:08.494 --> 00:43:09.910
It turns out
actually, this theory

00:43:09.910 --> 00:43:17.295
was considered in the '30s
by this guy, Born and Infeld.

00:43:21.210 --> 00:43:23.610
Actually, maybe '30s or '40s.

00:43:23.610 --> 00:43:25.965
Anyway, prehistory.

00:43:29.430 --> 00:43:38.510
They invented as a
way to avoid-- they

00:43:38.510 --> 00:43:41.500
want to avoid the similarity
of the Maxwell theory.

00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:44.700
So in the Maxwell theory, if
you have a charged particle,

00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:47.154
and then the location
of the charged particle,

00:43:47.154 --> 00:43:48.570
then the field due
to that charged

00:43:48.570 --> 00:43:52.580
particle is singular and the
location of that particle.

00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:54.890
And so they want to avoid
that singular behavior,

00:43:54.890 --> 00:43:57.890
so they invented this
Born-Infeld action.

00:43:57.890 --> 00:44:02.800
And for many years, this action
does not have any applications.

00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:07.210
But if you invent something
nice, it will find its use.

00:44:07.210 --> 00:44:11.040
Just like in this
movie, Jurassic Park,

00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:12.220
life finds a way.

00:44:15.010 --> 00:44:16.320
Life always finds a way.

00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:20.810
So that's Born-Infeld.

00:44:24.420 --> 00:44:28.670
Now let's set F equal to 0.

00:44:28.670 --> 00:44:30.805
Let's just look at g alpha beta.

00:44:34.390 --> 00:44:37.460
Now let's look at g alpha beta.

00:44:37.460 --> 00:44:40.160
So g alpha beta, we can write it
in a slightly more transparent

00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:40.660
form.

00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:49.590
We can write a form which makes
it a bit more transparent.

00:44:49.590 --> 00:44:52.510
I can write it as the following.

00:44:52.510 --> 00:44:56.345
So even mu, remember,
is the Minkowski metric

00:44:56.345 --> 00:44:59.650
of the full space time.

00:44:59.650 --> 00:45:02.290
And I can write
this as following.

00:45:02.290 --> 00:45:12.640
x mu beta x mu x mu with
x alpha equal to x alpha,

00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:17.420
which is along the brane
direction, and xa to be phi a.

00:45:20.450 --> 00:45:24.780
So if you look at
this formula, you

00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:31.930
can see this is an induced
metric for some brane embedded

00:45:31.930 --> 00:45:33.920
in the full
Minkowski space time.

00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:36.710
And the x describes
such embedding.

00:45:43.250 --> 00:45:45.550
This generalization of this
induces the metric formula

00:45:45.550 --> 00:45:47.464
we encountered before
for the string.

00:45:47.464 --> 00:45:48.880
But right now, the
only difference

00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:51.260
is that now alpha
beta, they run all

00:45:51.260 --> 00:45:53.610
in the world-volume
direction of the D-brane.

00:45:53.610 --> 00:45:55.330
And then this becomes
an induced metric

00:45:55.330 --> 00:45:59.670
on the D-brane when it's
embedded in the space time.

00:45:59.670 --> 00:46:02.040
And this x alpha
equal to x alpha,

00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:04.180
it just means that
when we embed it,

00:46:04.180 --> 00:46:06.770
and we choose the
world-volume direction

00:46:06.770 --> 00:46:09.480
to be the same as the
space time direction

00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:11.430
along the brane direction.

00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:15.320
And in the perpendicular
direction, this is just phi a.

00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:19.760
And if you look at this,
this is exactly that.

00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:23.680
It's exactly that because
x alpha equal to x alpha.

00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:26.500
And then you just get
the eta alpha beta.

00:46:26.500 --> 00:46:31.160
And then for the other
direction, you get this one.

00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:33.410
Is this clear?

00:46:33.410 --> 00:46:50.850
So when f equal to 0, so this S
just becomes eta g alpha beta.

00:46:50.850 --> 00:47:07.960
So this is precisely the
volume element of DB-brane.

00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:10.439
Because this is the induced
metric, and then this

00:47:10.439 --> 00:47:12.480
is just the total volume
element of the DP-brane.

00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:18.810
And we see this is precisely
is the relativistic

00:47:18.810 --> 00:47:19.434
generalization.

00:47:23.330 --> 00:47:26.730
So this is just a generalization
of the [INAUDIBLE] action

00:47:26.730 --> 00:47:30.720
we wrote earlier,
which is for a string.

00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:34.540
Then this would be a
two dimensional area.

00:47:34.540 --> 00:47:37.450
And here, you just integrate
over the volume element

00:47:37.450 --> 00:47:39.830
of the whole D-brane.

00:47:39.830 --> 00:47:42.725
So we see that this
Born-Infeld corresponding

00:47:42.725 --> 00:47:47.519
to really describes the
relativistic motion of a p

00:47:47.519 --> 00:47:48.310
dimensional object.

00:47:52.250 --> 00:47:55.810
Describes the relativistic
motion of a p dimensional

00:47:55.810 --> 00:47:58.150
object.

00:47:58.150 --> 00:48:01.810
And this Dirac-Born-Infeld, when
you combine these two together,

00:48:01.810 --> 00:48:07.660
it magically combines these
two things into a single thing.

00:48:07.660 --> 00:48:09.484
Yes?

00:48:09.484 --> 00:48:11.150
AUDIENCE: So I recall
you saying earlier

00:48:11.150 --> 00:48:16.130
that-- you said that
people have played

00:48:16.130 --> 00:48:17.930
with this idea of
thinking about branes

00:48:17.930 --> 00:48:20.940
instead of just generically
higher dimensional objects

00:48:20.940 --> 00:48:23.250
and strings but no one
really understood the theory

00:48:23.250 --> 00:48:25.525
of these things because
the topology and geometry

00:48:25.525 --> 00:48:26.710
were too complicated.

00:48:26.710 --> 00:48:29.430
So it seems to me that wouldn't
you run into that same problem

00:48:29.430 --> 00:48:31.630
right here if it's indeed
some generalization

00:48:31.630 --> 00:48:32.750
of the [INAUDIBLE] action?

00:48:32.750 --> 00:48:36.370
HONG LIU: Yeah, but we
don't try to quantize it.

00:48:36.370 --> 00:48:38.770
At least we don't try
to quantize this action.

00:48:38.770 --> 00:48:41.080
And we know how to
quantize this action.

00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:46.520
And this is just our
ordinary field theory.

00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:48.060
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:48:48.060 --> 00:48:56.770
Here, we must impose the
big x as the coordinates

00:48:56.770 --> 00:48:58.640
in the target space.

00:48:58.640 --> 00:49:00.070
HONG LIU: That's right.

00:49:00.070 --> 00:49:05.530
AUDIENCE: So phi a must
be kind of a constant?

00:49:05.530 --> 00:49:09.200
I mean, why there should
be a constant part on--

00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:11.370
HONG LIU: No.

00:49:11.370 --> 00:49:14.920
If the derivative of those
things are not small,

00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:18.210
then there will be
many other terms.

00:49:18.210 --> 00:49:19.660
This will not be
the only action.

00:49:19.660 --> 00:49:21.572
AUDIENCE: Given a constant.

00:49:21.572 --> 00:49:22.882
HONG LIU: Sorry?

00:49:22.882 --> 00:49:24.340
AUDIENCE: You said
with a constant.

00:49:24.340 --> 00:49:26.506
HONG LIU: The partial alpha
phi a equal to constant.

00:49:26.506 --> 00:49:28.240
AUDIENCE: Oh, equals a constant.

00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:29.190
So that means--

00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:30.580
HONG LIU: No.

00:49:30.580 --> 00:49:33.020
What I'm saying is that if
these are constants, then

00:49:33.020 --> 00:49:36.920
this is our exact
string theory action.

00:49:36.920 --> 00:49:38.512
And when these
are not constants,

00:49:38.512 --> 00:49:40.220
and then this is a
leading approximation,

00:49:40.220 --> 00:49:41.860
there will be higher
order terms which

00:49:41.860 --> 00:49:46.790
depend on their derivatives.

00:49:46.790 --> 00:49:47.684
Yes?

00:49:47.684 --> 00:49:48.350
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:49:48.350 --> 00:49:49.808
One thing I just
don't understand--

00:49:49.808 --> 00:49:52.230
why is it that we don't want
to try to quantize anything?

00:49:52.230 --> 00:49:55.200
Shouldn't it be
quantized in principle?

00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:57.249
These are the sort
of classical analogs

00:49:57.249 --> 00:49:58.640
of things you want to quantize.

00:49:58.640 --> 00:49:59.717
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:49:59.717 --> 00:50:01.550
AUDIENCE: So this is
to say that this object

00:50:01.550 --> 00:50:03.258
that we don't really
know how to quantize

00:50:03.258 --> 00:50:05.997
is-- we just don't do it
because we don't know how.

00:50:05.997 --> 00:50:06.622
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:50:06.622 --> 00:50:07.095
AUDIENCE: I see.

00:50:07.095 --> 00:50:07.595
OK.

00:50:07.595 --> 00:50:09.495
It's not because-- fair enough.

00:50:09.495 --> 00:50:10.120
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:50:10.120 --> 00:50:12.960
You should try anything.

00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:17.460
And only those people who have
succeeded in the history books.

00:50:21.670 --> 00:50:24.194
Only a few have won the
battle in the history books.

00:50:24.194 --> 00:50:26.860
And if you just fail the battle,
you're not in the history book.

00:50:30.964 --> 00:50:32.630
So people have tried
this but failed it,

00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:34.740
but that won't be
written in the books.

00:50:34.740 --> 00:50:36.620
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:50:36.620 --> 00:50:37.410
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:50:37.410 --> 00:50:39.540
So you did the square
root by summing over

00:50:39.540 --> 00:50:43.000
all the massive terms in the--

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:43.680
HONG LIU: Sorry?

00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:45.380
AUDIENCE: You get
the square root term

00:50:45.380 --> 00:50:49.070
by summing the series,
including the massive fields?

00:50:49.070 --> 00:50:49.640
HONG LIU: No.

00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:51.554
This is still the gauge
field and the phi.

00:50:51.554 --> 00:50:52.220
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:50:52.220 --> 00:50:53.850
So how do you get it?

00:50:53.850 --> 00:50:55.919
What's the series
that you're summing?

00:50:55.919 --> 00:50:56.460
HONG LIU: Hm?

00:50:56.460 --> 00:50:57.650
AUDIENCE: What's the
series that you're summing?

00:50:57.650 --> 00:50:57.800
HONG LIU: Oh.

00:50:57.800 --> 00:50:59.341
I'm just saying in
the string theory,

00:50:59.341 --> 00:51:01.700
typically you don't
start by f squared.

00:51:01.700 --> 00:51:04.220
You have f cubed,
f four, et cetera.

00:51:04.220 --> 00:51:08.010
You can sum all
of them together.

00:51:08.010 --> 00:51:12.520
Even for the massless mode,
these are just leading terms.

00:51:12.520 --> 00:51:15.910
And these terms would be the
smallest number of derivatives,

00:51:15.910 --> 00:51:20.250
and so they dominate
at low energies.

00:51:20.250 --> 00:51:24.950
But in general, even just
for the effective serial

00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:28.150
massless mode, you can have
many, many other terms.

00:51:28.150 --> 00:51:29.790
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:51:29.790 --> 00:51:33.050
If we assume that partial
alpha phi a is a constant,

00:51:33.050 --> 00:51:37.135
then we can solve out the phi
a is proportional to x alpha.

00:51:37.135 --> 00:51:40.220
But how can you
assume they're just

00:51:40.220 --> 00:51:42.402
the coordinate in target space?

00:51:42.402 --> 00:51:43.110
HONG LIU: No, no.

00:51:43.110 --> 00:51:45.780
This is a function of alpha.

00:51:45.780 --> 00:51:47.660
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:51:47.660 --> 00:51:51.040
But since it's a
function of x alpha,

00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:56.157
why it can be regarded as the
coordinate in target space?

00:51:56.157 --> 00:51:56.823
HONG LIU: Sorry.

00:51:56.823 --> 00:51:58.230
I don't understand.

00:51:58.230 --> 00:51:59.730
AUDIENCE: All the
coordinates should

00:51:59.730 --> 00:52:02.124
be independent in target space.

00:52:02.124 --> 00:52:02.790
HONG LIU: Sorry.

00:52:02.790 --> 00:52:03.550
I don't understand.

00:52:03.550 --> 00:52:04.425
They are independent.

00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:10.240
These are the
virtual coordinates.

00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:13.640
These are the volume
coordinates of D-brane.

00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:16.860
And these are the target
space coordinates.

00:52:16.860 --> 00:52:18.710
I'm just choosing the
function of the target

00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:19.683
space coordinates.

00:52:23.140 --> 00:52:25.530
I'm choosing here
just to be identical

00:52:25.530 --> 00:52:27.502
to the world-volume coordinate.

00:52:27.502 --> 00:52:29.210
And this one I choose
to be some function

00:52:29.210 --> 00:52:30.633
of the world-volume coordinate.

00:52:30.633 --> 00:52:32.112
Of course I can do that.

00:52:35.467 --> 00:52:36.300
Any other questions?

00:52:46.420 --> 00:52:50.580
So again, this highlights
that D-brane is really

00:52:50.580 --> 00:52:52.550
a dynamical object.

00:52:52.550 --> 00:53:00.900
In fact, at low energies, they
move like [INAUDIBLE] motion.

00:53:00.900 --> 00:53:04.090
And they actually
move relativistically

00:53:04.090 --> 00:53:06.180
if you give enough
velocity, et cetera.

00:53:11.170 --> 00:53:13.290
Because of the fluctuations
of the D-brane,

00:53:13.290 --> 00:53:18.920
they become a really
full dynamical object.

00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:19.810
They have a mass.

00:53:19.810 --> 00:53:21.380
They can move around.

00:53:21.380 --> 00:53:23.775
And now you can
deform their shape.

00:53:23.775 --> 00:53:27.212
If you have enough energy,
you can bend them, et cetera.

00:53:27.212 --> 00:53:28.420
You can do whatever you want.

00:53:37.290 --> 00:53:42.150
So let me mention
one last thing.

00:53:42.150 --> 00:53:50.060
So you may ask,
why somehow those

00:53:50.060 --> 00:53:53.500
fields which describe the
motion of the D-brane,

00:53:53.500 --> 00:53:56.330
they're corresponding
to the massless modes

00:53:56.330 --> 00:54:04.390
on the world-volume
of the D-branes?

00:54:04.390 --> 00:54:08.730
Whether this is a
coincidence, or why it somehow

00:54:08.730 --> 00:54:14.710
happens to be the massless
mode on the D-brane

00:54:14.710 --> 00:54:18.820
which describes the
motion of the D-brane.

00:54:18.820 --> 00:54:21.710
So this is not an accident.

00:54:21.710 --> 00:54:23.490
This is not an accident.

00:54:23.490 --> 00:54:42.910
The reason is
that-- so why modes

00:54:42.910 --> 00:55:04.000
describing motions of D-branes
appear as massless modes?

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:05.560
So this is not accident.

00:55:05.560 --> 00:55:13.630
So underlying reason, it's
because the underlying

00:55:13.630 --> 00:55:27.980
Minkowski space is
translation invariant.

00:55:31.390 --> 00:55:37.330
So that means that no matter
where you put the D-brane,

00:55:37.330 --> 00:55:40.950
it should be a
well-defined configuration.

00:55:40.950 --> 00:55:43.810
Should be a well-defined
configuration no matter where

00:55:43.810 --> 00:55:45.226
you put on the D-brane.

00:55:45.226 --> 00:55:50.990
Then that means that the
[INAUDIBLE] action for the phi

00:55:50.990 --> 00:55:53.620
cannot contain a potential term.

00:55:53.620 --> 00:55:54.880
They cannot be potential term.

00:55:54.880 --> 00:55:57.420
They should not be, say,
somewhere is the minimum,

00:55:57.420 --> 00:55:59.330
somewhere is the
maximum, cannot happen.

00:55:59.330 --> 00:56:01.030
Everywhere must be the same.

00:56:01.030 --> 00:56:05.175
So it means the dependence
on y can only be derivative.

00:56:05.175 --> 00:56:07.370
Can only depend on derivatives.

00:56:07.370 --> 00:56:11.140
And of course, at low energies,
if you have derivatives,

00:56:11.140 --> 00:56:12.860
then can only be the
massless particle.

00:56:15.940 --> 00:56:18.880
So translation invariant.

00:56:18.880 --> 00:56:26.090
So this means that any
phi a equal to constant

00:56:26.090 --> 00:56:31.080
should be allowed
configurations.

00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:47.790
That means cannot
have potential.

00:56:50.470 --> 00:56:52.475
So max term is like
a potential for phi.

00:56:59.560 --> 00:57:03.140
To say in the fancy words
of Quantum Field Theory

00:57:03.140 --> 00:57:11.920
II or Quantum Field Theory III,
that the phi a, in other words,

00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:29.451
phi a are the Goldstone
bosons for breaking

00:57:29.451 --> 00:57:30.437
translation symmetries.

00:57:46.740 --> 00:57:51.566
So previously, Minkowski space
is translation invariant.

00:57:51.566 --> 00:57:53.210
And now if you put
a D-brane there,

00:57:53.210 --> 00:57:55.161
then you break that
translation symmetry.

00:57:55.161 --> 00:57:57.285
The location of the D-brane
breaks that translation

00:57:57.285 --> 00:57:58.535
symmetry.

00:57:58.535 --> 00:58:01.700
If I even put the
D-brane anywhere,

00:58:01.700 --> 00:58:04.260
then that means the
modes, the dynamics

00:58:04.260 --> 00:58:07.130
control the location
of the D-brane

00:58:07.130 --> 00:58:10.805
must not have any potential,
can only have derivative terms.

00:58:14.470 --> 00:58:17.390
So in other words, when
you put the D-brane in,

00:58:17.390 --> 00:58:23.740
you spontaneously break
the translation symmetry

00:58:23.740 --> 00:58:25.102
on the line in Minkowski space.

00:58:33.634 --> 00:58:34.800
So let me mention one thing.

00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:35.880
Then we can have a break.

00:58:39.920 --> 00:58:41.270
I'll mention one quick thing.

00:58:58.440 --> 00:59:05.619
So let me say a few words on
the strength of the open string

00:59:05.619 --> 00:59:06.160
interactions.

00:59:27.160 --> 00:59:34.500
So previously, we described
that the closed strings, they

00:59:34.500 --> 00:59:40.350
interact by such joining
and splitting procedure.

00:59:45.770 --> 00:59:47.390
And the strength
here is capped by gs.

00:59:50.104 --> 00:59:52.270
So the closed string coupling
is essentially the gs,

00:59:52.270 --> 00:59:55.187
which describes such a process.

00:59:55.187 --> 00:59:57.020
So if you have an open
string, of course you

00:59:57.020 --> 01:00:00.840
have a similar process, just
string ends joined together.

01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:05.272
You can join string
ends together.

01:00:08.190 --> 01:00:11.760
So here, you really
just have open string.

01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:16.200
So now these lines are the
boundaries of open string,

01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:18.680
or the endpoints of open string.

01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:21.210
So you have two open
strings joined together

01:00:21.210 --> 01:00:23.050
from another one.

01:00:23.050 --> 01:00:25.940
So let's call this
interaction go

01:00:25.940 --> 01:00:28.508
describing the interaction
of the open string.

01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:33.685
So the question is, how
is this go related to gs?

01:00:36.820 --> 01:00:38.940
And there's a single way
we can figure it out.

01:00:42.430 --> 01:00:44.780
So let's consider the
simplest situation.

01:00:44.780 --> 01:00:50.390
Just have open string
propagate in time.

01:00:50.390 --> 01:00:52.680
Again, this is two
boundaries open string.

01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:53.970
We just propagate in time.

01:01:02.020 --> 01:01:05.300
Now let's consider a
more complicated process.

01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:07.600
So the open string
propagates in time.

01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:15.030
So this is just a simple surface
with one initial open string

01:01:15.030 --> 01:01:17.756
and one final open string.

01:01:17.756 --> 01:01:19.990
And you can see the
complicated process

01:01:19.990 --> 01:01:23.210
because we have a
hole in the middle.

01:01:23.210 --> 01:01:27.770
So now the string worksheet
is like this, just this part.

01:01:27.770 --> 01:01:29.440
We have a hole in the middle.

01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:34.250
And this is another
configuration

01:01:34.250 --> 01:01:36.050
to have some initial
open string propagate

01:01:36.050 --> 01:01:39.230
to some final open string.

01:01:39.230 --> 01:01:49.150
So now we know, by counting
we did before described here.

01:01:49.150 --> 01:01:52.240
So here, we're
adding one boundary.

01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:55.390
We are adding one boundary.

01:01:55.390 --> 01:01:56.480
So this adds a boundary.

01:02:01.580 --> 01:02:06.880
So that means we must
add a factor of gs.

01:02:10.310 --> 01:02:13.200
Because from this formula,
this is g minus chi.

01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:16.120
And chi is minus b.

01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:18.370
So if we increase one
boundary, then you

01:02:18.370 --> 01:02:19.460
increase a factor of gs.

01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:28.100
But we can also
view this diagram

01:02:28.100 --> 01:02:30.500
as a single open
string comes in.

01:02:35.330 --> 01:02:39.350
The opposite of this splits
into two open strings

01:02:39.350 --> 01:02:42.667
and then they close together.

01:02:42.667 --> 01:02:48.950
So one split operation,
and the one join operation.

01:02:51.930 --> 01:02:56.160
So that should
correspond to go squared.

01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:58.910
So then this means that
we conclude that gs must

01:02:58.910 --> 01:03:01.920
be proportional to go squared.

01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:06.320
The open string coupling
strings is the square root

01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:08.880
of the closed
string interaction.

01:03:13.201 --> 01:03:13.700
Yes?

01:03:13.700 --> 01:03:15.985
AUDIENCE: What's the
strength of the process when

01:03:15.985 --> 01:03:17.770
closed string becomes open
string and vice versa?

01:03:17.770 --> 01:03:18.035
HONG LIU: Sorry?

01:03:18.035 --> 01:03:20.415
AUDIENCE: What's the strength
of the process when closed

01:03:20.415 --> 01:03:21.706
string becomes and open string?

01:03:21.706 --> 01:03:22.390
HONG LIU: Right.

01:03:22.390 --> 01:03:24.210
Yeah, you can
consider such process.

01:03:27.020 --> 01:03:33.620
Again, you can just
do it by counting

01:03:33.620 --> 01:03:35.462
the topology of the surface.

01:03:35.462 --> 01:03:36.420
Such process can exist.

01:03:44.510 --> 01:03:45.010
OK.

01:03:45.010 --> 01:03:46.260
Then let's have a short break.

01:03:48.940 --> 01:03:53.130
So what time is it?

01:03:53.130 --> 01:03:53.740
It's 38.

01:03:57.390 --> 01:04:02.030
When should we start again?

01:04:02.030 --> 01:04:03.380
41?

01:04:03.380 --> 01:04:03.880
OK, 41.

01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:06.370
Let's start at 41.

01:04:06.370 --> 01:04:08.980
So we have talked about
D-branes, et cetera.

01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:14.710
And we have already seen
some remarkable aspects

01:04:14.710 --> 01:04:16.380
of the D-brane,
including this channel

01:04:16.380 --> 01:04:23.530
duality between the
closed string exchange

01:04:23.530 --> 01:04:26.744
can be considered
open string loop.

01:04:26.744 --> 01:04:29.160
And now we are going to see a
lot of magic of the D-brane.

01:04:35.081 --> 01:04:37.330
And this comes when you put
several D-branes together.

01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:18.160
So normally, our
conventional intuition

01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:26.050
says if you find some
particle, say in this case,

01:05:26.050 --> 01:05:27.320
you find the D-brane.

01:05:27.320 --> 01:05:29.980
So if you put two
particles together,

01:05:29.980 --> 01:05:31.710
nothing much really changes.

01:05:31.710 --> 01:05:33.170
It's two particles.

01:05:33.170 --> 01:05:35.590
Put three particles together.

01:05:35.590 --> 01:05:36.436
Not much changes.

01:05:36.436 --> 01:05:37.310
It's three particles.

01:05:39.940 --> 01:05:43.370
But when you put multiple
D-branes together,

01:05:43.370 --> 01:05:48.690
things change a lot in
a very profound way.

01:05:48.690 --> 01:05:53.640
So now let's consider
just two D-branes.

01:05:53.640 --> 01:05:55.010
So let's consider two D-branes.

01:06:23.310 --> 01:06:26.380
Let's consider example.

01:06:26.380 --> 01:06:29.366
So let me first just tell
you the naive intuition.

01:06:33.590 --> 01:06:35.840
Suppose you have D-brane
one, D-brane two.

01:06:38.990 --> 01:06:42.850
So for this one, we
have a u1 gauge field.

01:06:42.850 --> 01:06:46.840
For this one, you
have a u1 gauge field.

01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:50.510
Because each one, we have
a gauge field, a Maxwell.

01:06:50.510 --> 01:06:53.420
When you put together,
from conventional wisdom,

01:06:53.420 --> 01:06:55.290
you say, maybe I just
have two Maxwell.

01:06:57.890 --> 01:06:59.850
From conventional
wisdom, you two Maxwell.

01:06:59.850 --> 01:07:02.600
Naively, if I put them together,
I just have two Maxwells.

01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:05.683
1 plus 1 equal to 2.

01:07:10.780 --> 01:07:15.800
But in string theory,
1 plus 1 equal to 4.

01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:17.370
It's actually equal to 2.

01:07:17.370 --> 01:07:21.810
It's also equal to 2, depending
on how you think about it.

01:07:21.810 --> 01:07:26.050
Anyway, one way to think about
it is 1 plus 1 becomes 4.

01:07:26.050 --> 01:07:31.410
So to see 1 plus 1
become 4 is very easy.

01:07:31.410 --> 01:07:34.636
So let's consider these two
branes on top of each other.

01:07:34.636 --> 01:07:36.510
But in order to distinguish
these two branes,

01:07:36.510 --> 01:07:38.350
I just separate
them a little bit.

01:07:38.350 --> 01:07:42.550
But you should really think
of them on top of each other.

01:07:42.550 --> 01:07:47.040
And so now you have
four types of strings.

01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:52.970
You can have string going
to 1, 1, going to 2, 2,

01:07:52.970 --> 01:07:56.180
then going to 1,
2, going to 2, 1.

01:07:56.180 --> 01:08:00.080
So 2, 1 and 1, 2 are different
because the oriented string.

01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:02.850
So I put arrow there.

01:08:02.850 --> 01:08:04.880
So this is from 1 to 2.

01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:05.740
This is from 2 to 1.

01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:15.769
So we have four types of
strings-- 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1,

01:08:15.769 --> 01:08:16.269
2, 2.

01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:23.256
AUDIENCE: Why is oriented--

01:08:23.256 --> 01:08:24.779
HONG LIU: Hm?

01:08:24.779 --> 01:08:28.609
AUDIENCE: Why the 1 to
2, 2 to 1 are different?

01:08:28.609 --> 01:08:32.550
HONG LIU: It's because for
this string, sigma 0 here.

01:08:32.550 --> 01:08:33.899
For this one, sigma pi there.

01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:39.140
For this string, sigma 0 there.

01:08:39.140 --> 01:08:41.189
And for this one,
sigma pi there.

01:08:46.149 --> 01:08:48.410
Let me just elaborate
on this point.

01:08:48.410 --> 01:08:52.040
So suppose I have
a string like this.

01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:55.819
Then this string is sigma
0 point ending on 1,

01:08:55.819 --> 01:08:58.170
sigma equal to pi ending on 2.

01:08:58.170 --> 01:08:59.880
But if I have a
string like that,

01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:03.066
then there's a sigma 0 ending
here and sigma pi ending there.

01:09:09.386 --> 01:09:13.370
So you have four
types of open strings.

01:09:13.370 --> 01:09:15.120
And now if you think
about how we quantize

01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:18.569
those strings, and the
four types of open strings,

01:09:18.569 --> 01:09:21.370
they actually have
identical spectrum.

01:09:21.370 --> 01:09:23.370
Because for all of them,
the boundary conditions

01:09:23.370 --> 01:09:25.446
are exactly the same.

01:09:25.446 --> 01:09:26.946
Because the boundary
conditions only

01:09:26.946 --> 01:09:29.359
know the location
of the D-branes.

01:09:29.359 --> 01:09:31.810
So all four types
of open strings

01:09:31.810 --> 01:09:35.140
have identical spectrum.

01:09:35.140 --> 01:09:46.890
So in other words, each
string excitation--

01:09:46.890 --> 01:09:53.750
say this is the state on the
worksheet-- each state becomes

01:09:53.750 --> 01:09:58.270
four states because
I can label IJ.

01:09:58.270 --> 01:10:02.170
Now suppose I use I and
J to label 1 and the 2.

01:10:02.170 --> 01:10:05.850
I and J can be 1 and 2.

01:10:05.850 --> 01:10:08.590
So depending on whether this
is 1, 1 string, or 1, 2 string,

01:10:08.590 --> 01:10:12.100
or 2, 1 string, or 2, 2 string.

01:10:12.100 --> 01:10:15.030
So this is what I said
1 plus 1 equal to 4.

01:10:15.030 --> 01:10:19.070
Because naively, you would
say I have two massless modes.

01:10:19.070 --> 01:10:20.150
But now I have four.

01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:37.910
For example, the massless modes
become four copies of them.

01:10:51.990 --> 01:11:19.815
In other words, you can think
each open string excitation a 2

01:11:19.815 --> 01:11:20.380
by 2 matrix.

01:11:26.210 --> 01:11:28.616
I can use 2 index to label them.

01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:34.570
In particular, for example,
the corresponding fields--

01:11:34.570 --> 01:11:38.210
so each string excitation
corresponding to some field.

01:11:38.210 --> 01:11:43.020
For example, the gauge
field associated with this

01:11:43.020 --> 01:11:48.270
now has two index, I
J. And similar with phi

01:11:48.270 --> 01:12:04.050
a I J. Of course, this
generalizes immediately

01:12:04.050 --> 01:12:20.186
to if you have n branes,
then just becomes n times

01:12:20.186 --> 01:12:20.920
n matrices.

01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:30.741
So 1 plus 1 plus 1 to
n becomes n squared.

01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:40.740
So now let me give some remarks.

01:12:45.150 --> 01:12:48.330
So this basic
structure turns out

01:12:48.330 --> 01:12:52.340
to be, again, very,
very profound.

01:12:52.340 --> 01:12:54.234
Now let me give some remarks.

01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:09.070
So there's a reason
I call-- so this

01:13:09.070 --> 01:13:11.135
is something with the 2 index.

01:13:16.010 --> 01:13:19.330
So of course, you
naturally call it a matrix.

01:13:19.330 --> 01:13:22.010
But there's another reason
to think about this really

01:13:22.010 --> 01:13:25.100
as a matrix.

01:13:25.100 --> 01:13:29.640
It's because the
strings, as we were

01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:32.394
doing there, the open
strings, they interact

01:13:32.394 --> 01:13:33.310
by joining their ends.

01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:54.270
So this naturally leads to--
when those strings interact

01:13:54.270 --> 01:13:59.150
with each other, and
those parts naturally

01:13:59.150 --> 01:14:14.970
just emerges as a matrix
product, I, J indices.

01:14:19.450 --> 01:14:22.990
So it's easy to see.

01:14:25.810 --> 01:14:27.410
So let me just draw that.

01:14:27.410 --> 01:14:30.730
Let me just do it here
to save some time.

01:14:30.730 --> 01:14:37.320
Suppose this is I. This is J.
So this is sigma equal to 0,

01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:38.740
sigma equal to pi.

01:14:38.740 --> 01:14:41.090
And the sigma equal to
pi joins with stigma 0

01:14:41.090 --> 01:14:42.279
to end of the other one.

01:14:42.279 --> 01:14:44.320
But of course, if you want
to join them together,

01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:46.570
their J's have to be the same.

01:14:46.570 --> 01:14:51.870
This is K. Then you go to I,
K. And when they join together,

01:14:51.870 --> 01:14:54.390
then you sum of
all possible J's.

01:14:54.390 --> 01:14:56.164
Then this is like
a matrix product.

01:15:00.680 --> 01:15:05.450
So if I draw it in the
diagram not very well.

01:15:05.450 --> 01:15:11.560
Now let me separate I,
J, K to be three things.

01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:14.010
But they don't have
to be separated.

01:15:14.010 --> 01:15:17.560
I, J, K can also be the same.

01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:20.410
But in order to
emphasize this picture is

01:15:20.410 --> 01:15:28.700
that you have a string to go
from I to J. Suppose this is I,

01:15:28.700 --> 01:15:31.890
this is J, this is
K. Go from I to J,

01:15:31.890 --> 01:15:37.830
then from J to K. So
sigma 0, sigma pi.

01:15:37.830 --> 01:15:40.280
And the pi end joins
with the sigma 0 end.

01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:42.185
And then here, you
get the string.

01:15:45.830 --> 01:15:49.290
So that diagram
roughly can also be

01:15:49.290 --> 01:15:51.350
think of a diagram like this.

01:15:51.350 --> 01:15:57.350
Two strings join into one
string with index I and K.

01:15:57.350 --> 01:15:58.850
And the I, K, K can
all be the same.

01:15:58.850 --> 01:16:03.690
I just make them different
to make it clear.

01:16:03.690 --> 01:16:09.950
And of course, when
you join J together,

01:16:09.950 --> 01:16:14.860
you have the sum of them because
they can be in principle all

01:16:14.860 --> 01:16:15.570
possible J's.

01:16:19.615 --> 01:16:23.810
So it naturally appears
as a matrix product.

01:16:23.810 --> 01:16:28.720
Just follows by the nature
of string interaction.

01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:32.180
And now there's another
remarkable thing

01:16:32.180 --> 01:16:35.330
is that if you can see the phi
a, so the same thing applies

01:16:35.330 --> 01:16:39.370
for a alpha applies
to any field.

01:16:39.370 --> 01:16:43.240
It's that 1q-- so
this corresponds

01:16:43.240 --> 01:16:49.849
to a string with sigma equal
to 0 at 1 and sigma pi.

01:16:49.849 --> 01:16:51.390
So this corresponds
to a 1, 2 string.

01:16:53.940 --> 01:16:59.875
And then we can also think
about the 2, 1 string.

01:17:02.650 --> 01:17:06.500
So it turns out
that these two can

01:17:06.500 --> 01:17:20.009
be considered as complex
conjugates of each other

01:17:20.009 --> 01:17:21.050
for the following reason.

01:17:28.820 --> 01:17:34.910
Again, now let me just
again separate this 1 and 2

01:17:34.910 --> 01:17:37.360
to make it clear.

01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:40.350
So this is a 1, 2 string.

01:17:40.350 --> 01:17:41.903
So this is a 2, 1 string.

01:17:45.980 --> 01:17:54.639
So I claim string interactions
defined by this way

01:17:54.639 --> 01:17:55.805
have the following symmetry.

01:17:58.410 --> 01:18:06.507
So string interactions
described by joining the ends

01:18:06.507 --> 01:18:08.590
or splitting the ends have
the following symmetry.

01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:34.258
It's that I can associate
each brane by a phase factor.

01:18:38.700 --> 01:18:43.099
So I explained to you i theta
I. So I labeled to the brane

01:18:43.099 --> 01:18:45.265
and the theta can be some
different-- can be a phase

01:18:45.265 --> 01:18:47.840
factor.

01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:51.010
And now the rule is
that if the sigma is

01:18:51.010 --> 01:18:58.875
equal to 0 and on
that brane, then

01:18:58.875 --> 01:19:04.250
I multiply it by the
exponential of i theta I.

01:19:04.250 --> 01:19:14.335
And the sigma equal to pi
ends on that brane, ends on I.

01:19:14.335 --> 01:19:15.585
Let me write it more explicit.

01:19:15.585 --> 01:19:23.692
So if sigma 0 ending
on I, then I multiply

01:19:23.692 --> 01:19:26.880
by a phase factor,
exponential i theta I.

01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:31.390
And if the sigma equal
to pi factor ending on I,

01:19:31.390 --> 01:19:40.020
then I multiply by
exponential minus i theta I.

01:19:40.020 --> 01:19:41.530
So let's consider
this operation.

01:19:41.530 --> 01:19:44.850
And I claim this operation
is the symmetry of the string

01:19:44.850 --> 01:19:46.050
interaction.

01:19:46.050 --> 01:19:50.090
So let's first consider if
you just have a single brane.

01:19:50.090 --> 01:19:54.290
So if you have a single
brane like this, then just

01:19:54.290 --> 01:19:55.790
nothing changes
because you multiply

01:19:55.790 --> 01:19:59.190
one end by i theta and the other
by exponential minus i theta,

01:19:59.190 --> 01:20:02.260
does not change.

01:20:02.260 --> 01:20:06.470
But now, if you have such
kind of interactions,

01:20:06.470 --> 01:20:14.750
because the sigma 0 and
sigma pi ends join together,

01:20:14.750 --> 01:20:18.280
and they can only join if they
are ending on the same brane,

01:20:18.280 --> 01:20:21.640
then those factors
always cancel each other.

01:20:21.640 --> 01:20:25.340
And so this would be a symmetry.

01:20:25.340 --> 01:20:26.170
Is this clear?

01:20:28.980 --> 01:20:41.280
So under this operation, phi
a ending on the same brane

01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:41.880
is invariant.

01:20:49.268 --> 01:20:55.508
And phi a I J then transforms
by a phase factor theta

01:20:55.508 --> 01:21:05.290
I minus theta J of phi
a I J. And the phi a J

01:21:05.290 --> 01:21:17.890
I transforms as a factor
minus I theta I minus theta J.

01:21:17.890 --> 01:21:22.039
So we can actually think of
them as complex conjugates.

01:21:22.039 --> 01:21:24.580
So they're transforming opposite
way under this phase change.

01:21:24.580 --> 01:21:25.020
Yes?

01:21:25.020 --> 01:21:26.978
AUDIENCE: And this is
because we're considering

01:21:26.978 --> 01:21:28.000
them to be u1 branes?

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:28.500
HONG LIU: Sorry?

01:21:28.500 --> 01:21:30.916
AUDIENCE: Is this because we're
considering them to be u1?

01:21:30.916 --> 01:21:32.620
HONG LIU: No.

01:21:32.620 --> 01:21:34.350
This is a good point.

01:21:34.350 --> 01:21:36.330
I will talk about this more.

01:21:36.330 --> 01:21:38.455
Right now, let's think
about each brane separately.

01:21:42.264 --> 01:21:43.430
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

01:21:43.430 --> 01:21:48.310
In principle, can we write
the interaction of open string

01:21:48.310 --> 01:21:52.154
with the same note,
J, J by random number?

01:21:52.154 --> 01:21:52.820
HONG LIU: Sorry.

01:21:52.820 --> 01:21:54.660
What do you mean
by random number?

01:21:54.660 --> 01:21:57.840
AUDIENCE: Say it's I, J, K, L.

01:21:57.840 --> 01:21:58.800
HONG LIU: No, no, no.

01:21:58.800 --> 01:21:59.490
The strings can
only join together

01:21:59.490 --> 01:22:01.329
if they're ending
on the same brane.

01:22:01.329 --> 01:22:01.870
AUDIENCE: Oh.

01:22:01.870 --> 01:22:02.422
OK.

01:22:02.422 --> 01:22:04.130
HONG LIU: So the J's
have to be the same.

01:22:06.179 --> 01:22:07.970
So this guarantees that
this will symmetry.

01:22:12.150 --> 01:22:14.910
Good?

01:22:14.910 --> 01:22:18.570
So in this sense, they're
complex conjugates.

01:22:18.570 --> 01:22:21.160
And now we can build on
this a little bit further.

01:22:21.160 --> 01:22:22.729
So this actually works.

01:22:22.729 --> 01:22:24.270
Doesn't matter
whether the branes are

01:22:24.270 --> 01:22:26.870
coincident or not coincident.

01:22:26.870 --> 01:22:28.596
This is a generally true.

01:22:28.596 --> 01:22:29.970
Now let's consider
all the branes

01:22:29.970 --> 01:22:31.261
are coincident with each other.

01:22:36.801 --> 01:22:57.660
So for coincidental
branes, since branes

01:22:57.660 --> 01:23:12.960
are indistinguishable
from each other,

01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:15.010
so they are higher
dimensional generalization

01:23:15.010 --> 01:23:19.330
of what we call
identical particles.

01:23:19.330 --> 01:23:25.050
So if they're
indistinguishable from each,

01:23:25.050 --> 01:23:31.274
we can shuffle their indices.

01:23:31.274 --> 01:23:33.690
We should have the symmetry
to reshuffle their symmetries.

01:23:43.260 --> 01:23:47.515
So whether we call this 1,
1 or this 1, 2 or this 1,

01:23:47.515 --> 01:23:48.565
1 should not matter.

01:23:53.230 --> 01:23:58.810
So if I combine these two facts,
two observations together,

01:23:58.810 --> 01:24:03.720
then when we have n
coincidental branes,

01:24:03.720 --> 01:24:06.664
then there's in
fact u(n) symmetry.

01:24:18.100 --> 01:24:23.510
If that whole string
interaction is invariant, say

01:24:23.510 --> 01:24:39.200
if I have psi, I, J goes to say
U, I, K, U, J, L, star, psi, K,

01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:49.150
L. So back here on U
just corresponding to I

01:24:49.150 --> 01:24:50.710
reshuffle all the indices.

01:24:50.710 --> 01:24:53.880
So I have to do the same to U.
So I reshuffle the two indices

01:24:53.880 --> 01:24:55.000
in the same way.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.214
But I have a star here.

01:24:57.214 --> 01:24:58.380
It's because of this reason.

01:24:58.380 --> 01:25:02.870
Because in some sense,
the sigma 0 and sigma pi,

01:25:02.870 --> 01:25:07.390
they're only symmetries if I
multiply opposite phase factor.

01:25:07.390 --> 01:25:10.950
I can rewrite this
as a matrix notation.

01:25:10.950 --> 01:25:13.010
If you think about
each side as a matrix,

01:25:13.010 --> 01:25:14.634
then this is the
symmetry corresponding

01:25:14.634 --> 01:25:17.288
to psi U psi dagger.

01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:29.840
And the U can be arbitrary
unitary matrices.

01:25:36.210 --> 01:25:40.610
So in fact, when you have n
coincidental branes together,

01:25:40.610 --> 01:25:43.810
there's u(n) symmetries for
the string interactions.

01:25:52.320 --> 01:26:02.670
So to say it in a more
fancy mathematical language

01:26:02.670 --> 01:26:15.140
is that each open
string excitation

01:26:15.140 --> 01:26:30.510
transforms under the adjunct
representation of this u(n).

01:26:34.950 --> 01:26:36.650
So this is like a
join representation.

01:26:36.650 --> 01:26:38.496
If you have u(n)
symmetry, then this

01:26:38.496 --> 01:26:40.222
is like a join representation.

01:26:47.130 --> 01:26:57.256
So on the string worksheet, this
is really a global symmetry.

01:27:10.380 --> 01:27:14.090
So it's just a phase factor
associated with each n.

01:27:14.090 --> 01:27:15.730
There's nothing.

01:27:15.730 --> 01:27:17.416
It's a global symmetry.

01:27:22.260 --> 01:27:28.850
But the remarkable thing
is that in the space time,

01:27:28.850 --> 01:27:32.220
this becomes a gauge symmetry.

01:27:32.220 --> 01:27:36.050
So this tells you, because of
the presence of this u(n) gauge

01:27:36.050 --> 01:27:39.140
symmetry and
because of each mode

01:27:39.140 --> 01:27:44.170
transforms under a join
representation of some u(n),

01:27:44.170 --> 01:27:48.480
that as a space-time
field, they also

01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:53.890
must transform under a join
representation of some u(n).

01:27:53.890 --> 01:27:57.445
And interpreting the
space-time, then this u(n)

01:27:57.445 --> 01:28:01.120
must be a gauge symmetry.

01:28:01.120 --> 01:28:03.820
On the worksheet, it's
a global symmetry.

01:28:03.820 --> 01:28:15.342
But in space-time-- so
let me just write it down.

01:28:15.342 --> 01:28:22.110
In space-time--
or in other words,

01:28:22.110 --> 01:28:31.720
in the world volume
of D-branes, this u(n)

01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:46.230
must be a gauge symmetry
for the following reason.

01:28:53.760 --> 01:29:01.480
Because the only way
we know-- for example,

01:29:01.480 --> 01:29:05.910
this gauge field
becomes transformed

01:29:05.910 --> 01:29:12.380
under a join representation
of some u(n) symmetry.

01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:21.030
And all the excitations
will have this symmetry.

01:29:21.030 --> 01:29:22.650
And then the only
way we can make

01:29:22.650 --> 01:29:26.970
sense the gauge field
under such symmetry

01:29:26.970 --> 01:29:31.210
is that this is a gauge
symmetry and this is the gauge

01:29:31.210 --> 01:29:34.520
boson for that symmetry.

01:29:34.520 --> 01:29:37.780
Is it clear?

01:29:37.780 --> 01:29:43.571
So let me just say it in words.

01:29:43.571 --> 01:29:45.943
It must be a gauge symmetry.

01:29:45.943 --> 01:30:16.096
And in particular, a alpha I J
must be the corresponding gauge

01:30:16.096 --> 01:30:16.596
bosons.

01:30:22.392 --> 01:30:27.590
Because this is the only way
we know how to make sense,

01:30:27.590 --> 01:30:29.160
because this is the
only way we know

01:30:29.160 --> 01:30:32.260
can happen at low energies.

01:30:32.260 --> 01:30:37.710
Some gauge fields transformed
as a matrix interact

01:30:37.710 --> 01:30:39.180
with each other.

01:30:39.180 --> 01:30:41.315
And this can only be
Yang-Mills theory.

01:30:41.315 --> 01:30:42.690
And if this is
Yang-Mills theory,

01:30:42.690 --> 01:30:45.721
then this must be
a gauge symmetry.

01:30:45.721 --> 01:30:46.970
So this is the basic argument.

01:30:49.690 --> 01:31:04.992
And at low energies, we
must have Yang-Mills theory.

01:31:10.800 --> 01:31:12.185
So something remarkable happens.

01:31:17.830 --> 01:31:25.420
So each D-brane, when
we separate them.

01:31:25.420 --> 01:31:27.590
is a Maxwell theory.

01:31:27.590 --> 01:31:30.820
When you put them together,
they become Yang-Mills theory.

01:31:33.400 --> 01:31:35.060
And somehow, they
become non-Rubinian.

01:31:39.480 --> 01:31:44.790
And everything comes from,
in the very trivial way

01:31:44.790 --> 01:31:50.762
in string theory, you
just count the indicies.

01:31:50.762 --> 01:31:52.470
But the physical
implication is profound.

01:31:55.780 --> 01:31:57.680
And this can be
confirmed, again,

01:31:57.680 --> 01:31:59.509
by just starting
the explicit string

01:31:59.509 --> 01:32:00.675
theory scattering amplitude.

01:32:04.530 --> 01:32:10.007
You can calculate the scattering
of 3a in string theory.

01:32:10.007 --> 01:32:12.590
Then you find it's precisely--
at low energy, precisely given,

01:32:12.590 --> 01:32:18.960
but the same vertex as the
Yang-Mills theory, et cetera.

01:32:18.960 --> 01:32:20.100
So you can do that.

01:32:20.100 --> 01:32:22.184
Then you find the low
energy effective action can

01:32:22.184 --> 01:32:23.350
be written as the following.

01:32:25.980 --> 01:32:34.210
Some Yang-Mills coupling trace.

01:32:34.210 --> 01:32:36.444
Let me just write down
the Yang-Mills theory.

01:33:00.020 --> 01:33:03.160
You find the low
energy effective action

01:33:03.160 --> 01:33:05.910
can be written in this form.

01:33:05.910 --> 01:33:08.577
So this is standard
Yang-Mills field strings

01:33:08.577 --> 01:33:10.035
because now everything
is a matrix.

01:33:15.262 --> 01:33:16.220
Everything is a matrix.

01:33:29.240 --> 01:33:35.040
And both A alpha and phi a
now are embedded in matrices.

01:33:55.300 --> 01:34:01.400
So this g Yang-Mills is
the Yang-Mills coupling

01:34:01.400 --> 01:34:03.620
which describes how the
gauge fields interact

01:34:03.620 --> 01:34:05.160
with each other.

01:34:05.160 --> 01:34:11.350
And obviously, this should
be related to the open string

01:34:11.350 --> 01:34:17.590
interaction because-- I think
I have already erased it.

01:34:17.590 --> 01:34:22.110
This kind of interaction,
joining the string.

01:34:25.120 --> 01:34:26.700
This corresponding
to two strings

01:34:26.700 --> 01:34:30.260
joined into one string, and
this proportional to g0.

01:34:30.260 --> 01:34:33.690
And this, from the field
theory point of view,

01:34:33.690 --> 01:34:37.590
it just controls the
interaction of the three A's.

01:34:37.590 --> 01:34:39.600
So that must be the
Yang-Mills coupling.

01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:41.810
So this must be the
Yang-Mills coupling.

01:34:41.810 --> 01:34:44.365
And then this should
be related to gs

01:34:44.365 --> 01:34:50.480
to the power 1/2, which we
just derived slightly earlier.

01:34:50.480 --> 01:34:59.770
So now, on dimensional ground,
the g Yang-Mills square

01:34:59.770 --> 01:35:01.590
can be written as--
let me write it here.

01:35:01.590 --> 01:35:03.930
This is an important formula.

01:35:03.930 --> 01:35:08.420
On dimensional grounds,
the g Yang-Mills square,

01:35:08.420 --> 01:35:11.930
I should be able
to write it as gs.

01:35:11.930 --> 01:35:17.240
So on the Yang-Mills
coupling, we

01:35:17.240 --> 01:35:21.160
will use the standard
convention that A

01:35:21.160 --> 01:35:24.450
has the dimension of mass.

01:35:24.450 --> 01:35:27.552
And then this is a
dimension 4 object.

01:35:27.552 --> 01:35:30.402
And this is a
dimension p plus 1.

01:35:30.402 --> 01:35:31.860
And so the Yang-Mills
coupling, you

01:35:31.860 --> 01:35:38.370
can deduce the dimension of
the Yang-Mills coupling there.

01:35:38.370 --> 01:35:47.790
And it just turns out to
be p minus 3 dense-- again,

01:35:47.790 --> 01:35:53.000
because alpha prime in string
theory is only length scale.

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:57.200
So the alpha prime
must come from here.

01:35:57.200 --> 01:35:59.170
And then times some constant.

01:35:59.170 --> 01:36:01.248
So again, dp is just
some numerical constant.

01:36:09.650 --> 01:36:16.730
And you can see explicitly
that when p equal to 3,

01:36:16.730 --> 01:36:18.760
then you have d3 brane.

01:36:18.760 --> 01:36:22.175
Then the world volume
theory is four dimensional.

01:36:22.175 --> 01:36:24.790
Then we recall that
in four dimensions,

01:36:24.790 --> 01:36:26.940
Yang-Mills theory
is dimensionless.

01:36:26.940 --> 01:36:29.370
QCD [INAUDIBLE].

01:36:37.200 --> 01:36:38.170
Good?

01:36:38.170 --> 01:36:39.740
Any questions?

01:36:39.740 --> 01:36:40.240
Yes?

01:36:40.240 --> 01:36:42.829
AUDIENCE: What to do with phi h?

01:36:42.829 --> 01:36:43.370
HONG LIU: Hm?

01:36:43.370 --> 01:36:44.770
AUDIENCE: What to do with phi h?

01:36:44.770 --> 01:36:45.770
HONG LIU: What to do with phi h?

01:36:45.770 --> 01:36:47.394
What do you mean what
to do with phi h?

01:36:47.394 --> 01:36:49.970
AUDIENCE: Scalar
color particles?

01:36:49.970 --> 01:36:52.560
HONG LIU: Yeah.

01:36:52.560 --> 01:36:55.510
I forgot to mention here is the
standard derivative, covariant

01:36:55.510 --> 01:36:57.130
derivative.

01:36:57.130 --> 01:37:02.130
So the alpha phi a is just
the standard particle phi

01:37:02.130 --> 01:37:08.250
a minus i a alpha phi a.

01:37:08.250 --> 01:37:15.420
So it's the standard gauge
covariant derivative.

01:37:15.420 --> 01:37:19.510
AUDIENCE: Shouldn't phi be more
fundamental presentation of--

01:37:19.510 --> 01:37:20.230
HONG LIU: No.

01:37:20.230 --> 01:37:22.910
Everything is to the
join because everything

01:37:22.910 --> 01:37:24.111
has two ends.

01:37:24.111 --> 01:37:26.152
AUDIENCE: So how to
interpret phi, then, in our--

01:37:26.152 --> 01:37:27.010
HONG LIU: Hm?

01:37:27.010 --> 01:37:29.765
AUDIENCE: From the present
zoology of particles,

01:37:29.765 --> 01:37:32.400
where to put phi, the
observed particles?

01:37:32.400 --> 01:37:33.795
HONG LIU: Sorry?

01:37:33.795 --> 01:37:36.944
AUDIENCE: If a is just the
gauge boson [INAUDIBLE]

01:37:36.944 --> 01:37:38.800
or something, what is phi?

01:37:38.800 --> 01:37:40.590
HONG LIU: Phi is
some scalar field

01:37:40.590 --> 01:37:45.180
transformed on the join
representation of the gauge

01:37:45.180 --> 01:37:45.680
group.

01:37:45.680 --> 01:37:48.690
It's a matter field describing
the motion of the brane.

01:37:51.372 --> 01:37:52.720
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

01:37:52.720 --> 01:37:55.920
There you say that we can
reshuffle their indexes.

01:37:55.920 --> 01:37:59.489
So that symmetry should
be permutation symmetry?

01:37:59.489 --> 01:38:00.030
HONG LIU: No.

01:38:00.030 --> 01:38:01.113
AUDIENCE: Why [INAUDIBLE]?

01:38:05.690 --> 01:38:07.590
HONG LIU: But I reshuffle
because I say it

01:38:07.590 --> 01:38:10.420
in the more heuristic way.

01:38:10.420 --> 01:38:15.580
But normally, if the indices
is not-- these are the states.

01:38:15.580 --> 01:38:17.580
And you can just
swivel-post them.

01:38:17.580 --> 01:38:20.010
A different i, they
should be the same thing.

01:38:20.010 --> 01:38:22.426
They're just corresponding to
relabeling, I'm just saying.

01:38:24.689 --> 01:38:26.980
The lateral action of anything
on the state, of course,

01:38:26.980 --> 01:38:28.230
is the unitary transformation.

01:38:35.300 --> 01:38:39.206
AUDIENCE: Is there
anything to do with that?

01:38:41.639 --> 01:38:42.180
HONG LIU: No.

01:38:42.180 --> 01:38:44.010
That thing is
related to this star,

01:38:44.010 --> 01:38:45.300
why we put this star here.

01:38:50.500 --> 01:38:53.030
This is the reason why
we put the star there,

01:38:53.030 --> 01:38:55.250
because the two
endpoints, they should

01:38:55.250 --> 01:38:56.400
transform in opposite way.

01:38:59.630 --> 01:39:00.950
Yes?

01:39:00.950 --> 01:39:03.840
AUDIENCE: Since the
branes become dynamical,

01:39:03.840 --> 01:39:06.490
can't they fluctuate
in different ways

01:39:06.490 --> 01:39:09.494
and so no longer coincide?

01:39:09.494 --> 01:39:10.160
HONG LIU: Sorry?

01:39:10.160 --> 01:39:13.210
AUDIENCE: Since the
branes are dynamical,

01:39:13.210 --> 01:39:15.680
you put them all in
one place at first.

01:39:15.680 --> 01:39:18.870
But can't they now start
fluctuating and separate?

01:39:18.870 --> 01:39:20.844
HONG LIU: They can certainly.

01:39:20.844 --> 01:39:23.330
AUDIENCE: They're
no longer symmetric.

01:39:23.330 --> 01:39:24.900
They become distinguishable.

01:39:24.900 --> 01:39:26.622
HONG LIU: They can
certainly start

01:39:26.622 --> 01:39:32.030
moving apart if you give
them some initial motion.

01:39:32.030 --> 01:39:38.530
But the fluctuation,
the system is isotropic.

01:39:38.530 --> 01:39:41.315
There's no place for them
to-- they will fluctuate,

01:39:41.315 --> 01:39:43.190
but they will still at
that point on average.

01:39:46.176 --> 01:39:47.800
There's no preferred
direction for them

01:39:47.800 --> 01:39:50.730
to go unless you give
them a direction.

01:39:50.730 --> 01:39:53.019
You say, I want them to
go in that direction.

01:39:53.019 --> 01:39:53.810
Then you push them.

01:39:53.810 --> 01:39:55.185
AUDIENCE: But you
can still think

01:39:55.185 --> 01:39:57.300
of them fluctuating
kind of separately,

01:39:57.300 --> 01:39:59.090
separating in
their fluctuations?

01:39:59.090 --> 01:40:00.500
HONG LIU: Sure.

01:40:00.500 --> 01:40:01.760
This a are their fluctuations.

01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:05.250
Phi are their fluctuations.

01:40:05.250 --> 01:40:07.950
AUDIENCE: Is this commutative
term belonging to the effective

01:40:07.950 --> 01:40:11.735
action an interaction between
the D-branes or is it--

01:40:11.735 --> 01:40:12.360
HONG LIU: Yeah.

01:40:15.870 --> 01:40:17.850
Good point.

01:40:17.850 --> 01:40:21.940
Let me just comment
on this term.

01:40:21.940 --> 01:40:28.160
So if you think about
it, as we said before,

01:40:28.160 --> 01:40:33.490
a D-brane, no matter
what dimension

01:40:33.490 --> 01:40:35.490
of the D-brane, the story
when we quantize them,

01:40:35.490 --> 01:40:36.967
they're almost the same.

01:40:36.967 --> 01:40:37.925
It's the same spectrum.

01:40:42.120 --> 01:40:43.920
If you have a
space-feeling brane

01:40:43.920 --> 01:40:46.156
that everything is
A alpha, and then

01:40:46.156 --> 01:40:48.840
if you have some lower
dimensional brane, some of them

01:40:48.840 --> 01:40:50.580
become scalar field, et cetera.

01:40:50.580 --> 01:40:54.710
So essentially, they all
have the same dynamics.

01:40:54.710 --> 01:40:59.540
So this interaction can be
considered just come from here.

01:40:59.540 --> 01:41:02.110
So you can start with a
space time feeling brane,

01:41:02.110 --> 01:41:03.750
and then you go to
lower dimensions.

01:41:03.750 --> 01:41:08.100
And then this just can be
considered to come from there.

01:41:08.100 --> 01:41:10.720
It's part of the gauge theory.

01:41:10.720 --> 01:41:13.144
AUDIENCE: So the whole
low energy actions

01:41:13.144 --> 01:41:17.016
are the action of supergravity
plus this D-brane interaction,

01:41:17.016 --> 01:41:20.900
you can think of the
whole low energy action?

01:41:20.900 --> 01:41:23.356
HONG LIU: You mean if you
include the closed string?

01:41:23.356 --> 01:41:23.980
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:41:23.980 --> 01:41:24.722
HONG LIU: Yeah.

01:41:24.722 --> 01:41:26.180
That's right, if
you have D-branes.

01:41:26.180 --> 01:41:26.950
That's right.

01:41:26.950 --> 01:41:30.270
This is effective
action on the D-brane.

01:41:30.270 --> 01:41:32.860
This is the effective
action on the D-brane.

01:41:32.860 --> 01:41:37.690
AUDIENCE: I mean if you
extend D-brane [INAUDIBLE],

01:41:37.690 --> 01:41:41.426
then where does this
action come from?

01:41:41.426 --> 01:41:43.664
HONG LIU: No, that's
what you said.

01:41:43.664 --> 01:41:46.165
AUDIENCE: It's just two
actions crossed together?

01:41:46.165 --> 01:41:46.790
HONG LIU: Yeah.

01:41:49.640 --> 01:41:50.140
Good?

01:41:53.469 --> 01:41:54.435
AUDIENCE: Excuse me.

01:41:54.435 --> 01:41:56.430
How come it has the
term in action that's

01:41:56.430 --> 01:41:59.869
proportional to phi
without derivative?

01:41:59.869 --> 01:42:00.410
HONG LIU: No.

01:42:00.410 --> 01:42:01.270
They have derivative.

01:42:01.270 --> 01:42:02.519
This is covariant derivatives.

01:42:02.519 --> 01:42:03.859
AUDIENCE: The commutator.

01:42:03.859 --> 01:42:05.900
HONG LIU: No, but phi have
covariant derivatives.

01:42:05.900 --> 01:42:06.830
AUDIENCE: But the next time.

01:42:06.830 --> 01:42:07.454
HONG LIU: Yeah?

01:42:07.454 --> 01:42:10.692
AUDIENCE: That thing appears
to be proportional to phi

01:42:10.692 --> 01:42:11.664
without derivative.

01:42:11.664 --> 01:42:13.122
HONG LIU: Yes?

01:42:13.122 --> 01:42:15.630
AUDIENCE: But this is the
Minkowski space or something.

01:42:15.630 --> 01:42:16.369
HONG LIU: Yeah.

01:42:16.369 --> 01:42:17.410
That's a very good point.

01:42:17.410 --> 01:42:19.740
I'm going to mention that point.

01:42:19.740 --> 01:42:24.266
But the key is that this
particular potential-- this

01:42:24.266 --> 01:42:25.140
is a very good point.

01:42:25.140 --> 01:42:27.394
I'm going to mention that.

01:42:27.394 --> 01:42:28.935
I will mention that
in a few minutes.

01:42:31.910 --> 01:42:35.770
I do because I do want
you to do your p-set.

01:42:48.750 --> 01:42:52.065
So now let's consider
separating the branes.

01:42:55.599 --> 01:42:57.390
Now we will consider
separating the branes.

01:43:10.782 --> 01:43:12.240
Again, let's consider
the situation

01:43:12.240 --> 01:43:13.495
we just have two of them.

01:43:16.460 --> 01:43:18.680
So at the beginning,
they're coincidental.

01:43:18.680 --> 01:43:21.690
And then now let's separate
them in some direction.

01:43:21.690 --> 01:43:24.312
Let's call that direction x.

01:43:24.312 --> 01:43:26.270
So let's say they separate
by some distance, d.

01:43:28.940 --> 01:43:30.748
This is 1, this is 2.

01:43:34.180 --> 01:43:36.690
So of course, this 1, 1
and 2, 2 string, nothing

01:43:36.690 --> 01:43:43.570
changes because they're just
still ending on the same brane.

01:43:43.570 --> 01:43:45.129
But those strings
are now different.

01:43:49.720 --> 01:43:51.690
So now 1, 2 and 2, 1
strings become different.

01:43:58.420 --> 01:44:01.750
So 1, 1, 2, 2, exactly
the same as before.

01:44:11.070 --> 01:44:12.130
And the 1, 2 string.

01:44:12.130 --> 01:44:13.963
For example, let's
consider the 1, 2 string.

01:44:16.440 --> 01:44:18.780
Then the boundary
condition changes

01:44:18.780 --> 01:44:22.940
in the way I have sigma equal
to 0, say, in the x direction.

01:44:22.940 --> 01:44:23.770
Sigma equal to 0.

01:44:26.692 --> 01:44:28.239
Tau, say, is at some location.

01:44:28.239 --> 01:44:29.030
Let's call this x0.

01:44:33.190 --> 01:44:39.640
And then x sigma equal to pi
tau then becomes x0 plus d.

01:44:43.290 --> 01:44:46.480
So now it means when
you contact this string,

01:44:46.480 --> 01:44:51.560
you have to do a slightly
modified boundary condition.

01:44:51.560 --> 01:44:54.000
So you have start
with x equal to 0.

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.768
Now you must include a
term depend on sigma.

01:45:08.140 --> 01:45:11.020
And again, as before,
we take the xL

01:45:11.020 --> 01:45:14.080
to be minus xR and
periodic, et cetera.

01:45:17.730 --> 01:45:20.295
So for sigma equal to 0,
then this boundary condition

01:45:20.295 --> 01:45:21.570
is satisfied.

01:45:21.570 --> 01:45:24.410
But in order to satisfy the
boundary condition at pi,

01:45:24.410 --> 01:45:28.130
then you now need this w
equal to d divided by pi.

01:45:32.020 --> 01:45:36.490
You need to develop
d divided by pi.

01:45:36.490 --> 01:45:37.770
So now, you have a sigma term.

01:45:37.770 --> 01:45:41.419
So that will change your
[INAUDIBLE] condition.

01:45:41.419 --> 01:45:42.960
So remember the
[INAUDIBLE] condition

01:45:42.960 --> 01:45:48.190
we had before is something like
this, q alpha prime p minus,

01:45:48.190 --> 01:45:53.770
say, is p plus 4 pi alpha prime.

01:45:53.770 --> 01:45:54.770
Say for the open string.

01:45:54.770 --> 01:45:56.270
I'm writing the
open string version,

01:45:56.270 --> 01:46:00.085
which is, up to some numerical
factor, the same as closed

01:46:00.085 --> 01:46:01.948
string we wrote down before.

01:46:10.890 --> 01:46:15.440
So now, because of
this term, then there's

01:46:15.440 --> 01:46:19.630
additional contribution
on the right hand side.

01:46:19.630 --> 01:46:22.030
It makes sense
because now string

01:46:22.030 --> 01:46:24.490
has to be stretched
over some distance.

01:46:24.490 --> 01:46:26.580
That costs energy.

01:46:26.580 --> 01:46:30.630
So take one minute
to do it yourselves.

01:46:30.630 --> 01:46:31.820
Just plug this into here.

01:46:31.820 --> 01:46:35.270
You only need to look at
the behavior of this term.

01:46:35.270 --> 01:46:36.330
Just plug in there.

01:46:36.330 --> 01:46:40.170
Take you, say, five seconds.

01:46:40.170 --> 01:46:44.900
You find that the
massless condition now

01:46:44.900 --> 01:46:54.720
has one more term plus
the rest, as before.

01:46:54.720 --> 01:47:04.920
And that means now all the
previously massless particle,

01:47:04.920 --> 01:47:08.315
this here with the
corresponding a alpha and phi a,

01:47:08.315 --> 01:47:13.660
are no longer massless.

01:47:15.997 --> 01:47:17.580
Because previously,
they were massless

01:47:17.580 --> 01:47:19.520
because those terms are 0.

01:47:19.520 --> 01:47:22.210
But now you have one more term.

01:47:22.210 --> 01:47:27.240
And they have a mass
given by M divided

01:47:27.240 --> 01:47:31.070
by d divided by 2 alpha prime.

01:47:31.070 --> 01:47:33.790
Just take the
square root of that.

01:47:33.790 --> 01:47:37.925
And because this is precisely
the d times the string tension,

01:47:37.925 --> 01:47:40.280
because 1 over 2 pi alpha
prime is the string tension.

01:47:40.280 --> 01:47:42.720
So this is exactly the
energy we expect, just

01:47:42.720 --> 01:47:44.527
from a classical picture.

01:47:44.527 --> 01:47:46.360
You have a string
stretched between the two.

01:47:46.360 --> 01:47:50.860
Then this is the tension times
the length of the string.

01:47:59.310 --> 01:48:01.060
So now you can also
easily understand

01:48:01.060 --> 01:48:05.170
what's going on from field
theory point of view.

01:48:05.170 --> 01:48:11.930
And now you only have two
sets of massless modes

01:48:11.930 --> 01:48:14.370
now rather than four.

01:48:14.370 --> 01:48:22.840
So what's happening is that now,
the gauge symmetry is broken

01:48:22.840 --> 01:48:25.330
from u(2) to u(1) times u(1).

01:48:34.780 --> 01:48:45.210
So the separation of
the branes essentially

01:48:45.210 --> 01:48:55.310
corresponding to
the Higgs mechanism

01:48:55.310 --> 01:48:56.355
in the following sense.

01:49:01.160 --> 01:49:05.240
When you separate
the brane, I said

01:49:05.240 --> 01:49:10.420
before phi should be
interpreted as the [INAUDIBLE]

01:49:10.420 --> 01:49:12.120
location of the brane.

01:49:12.120 --> 01:49:13.630
But you separate the brane.

01:49:13.630 --> 01:49:15.720
That means one of the
five fields corresponding

01:49:15.720 --> 01:49:18.307
to the x-- the x is in
the transverse direction

01:49:18.307 --> 01:49:18.890
for the brane.

01:49:18.890 --> 01:49:21.889
One of the five fields
corresponding to the x

01:49:21.889 --> 01:49:23.180
must develop expectation value.

01:49:26.970 --> 01:49:31.808
And that expectation value
then gives rise to this mass.

01:49:31.808 --> 01:49:34.203
So this is precisely
a Higgs mechanism.

01:49:38.040 --> 01:49:45.650
So now let's go
back to the question

01:49:45.650 --> 01:49:50.310
what this potential term
means, whether we can actually,

01:49:50.310 --> 01:49:53.910
as we said before, because
of the translation symmetry,

01:49:53.910 --> 01:49:57.940
in principle, we can
pull the brane anywhere.

01:49:57.940 --> 01:50:01.070
And now, I'm out of time.

01:50:01.070 --> 01:50:07.830
So let me just say, if you
look at this potential,

01:50:07.830 --> 01:50:12.726
this becomes 0 precisely
when phi a and phi b all

01:50:12.726 --> 01:50:14.220
become commutes.

01:50:17.590 --> 01:50:20.470
So that means we can diagonalize
the phi corresponding to all

01:50:20.470 --> 01:50:23.429
the transverse directions.

01:50:23.429 --> 01:50:24.970
You can diagonalize
phi corresponding

01:50:24.970 --> 01:50:27.234
to all the transverse
directions.

01:50:27.234 --> 01:50:28.900
And then they correspond
to the location

01:50:28.900 --> 01:50:31.780
you put all your branes.

01:50:31.780 --> 01:50:37.190
Go do your p-set, and you will
see a more explicit discussion

01:50:37.190 --> 01:50:38.917
of this.

01:50:38.917 --> 01:50:40.000
And then one final remark.

01:50:42.700 --> 01:50:47.100
At the beginning, you started
with n branes together.

01:50:47.100 --> 01:50:50.900
And then because of this,
we can separate them.

01:50:50.900 --> 01:50:54.670
So we can find a solution
which, say they commute.

01:50:54.670 --> 01:51:01.825
We separate them into different
stacks, n1, n2, n3, et cetera.

01:51:05.410 --> 01:51:09.760
So this corresponds to
the configuration of phi.

01:51:16.190 --> 01:51:19.340
So let me just write
all phi as a vector.

01:51:19.340 --> 01:51:23.385
Say there's a1, n1 of
them at location a1,

01:51:23.385 --> 01:51:27.820
and n2 of them at
location a2, and ak.

01:51:31.580 --> 01:51:36.980
If I separate them into n
stacks, then will be like this.

01:51:36.980 --> 01:51:42.710
So n1 of them at location a1,
and n2 of them at location a2.

01:51:42.710 --> 01:51:45.090
You can check.

01:51:45.090 --> 01:51:53.206
So this is n1 times
n1 identity matrix.

01:51:53.206 --> 01:51:56.565
This is n2 times n2.

01:51:56.565 --> 01:52:00.480
And you can check that such
a configuration does satisfy

01:52:00.480 --> 01:52:03.290
this condition so
that you actually

01:52:03.290 --> 01:52:05.890
can separate the brane
into such configurations.

01:52:05.890 --> 01:52:07.830
And in this case, then
the gauge symmetry

01:52:07.830 --> 01:52:14.320
is broken into u
n1 times u n2 times

01:52:14.320 --> 01:52:18.620
u nk, because only those points
[INAUDIBLE] parts survives.

01:52:21.390 --> 01:52:23.930
And all the other strings
between them become massive.

01:52:23.930 --> 01:52:24.430
OK.

01:52:24.430 --> 01:52:26.312
Let's stop here.
