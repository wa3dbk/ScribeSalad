00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.060
PROFESSOR: All right, why don't
we go ahead and get started.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.680
So today what we
want to do is start

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.350
thinking a bit about evolution
in finite populations.

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:32.549
And of course, what
we mean by that,

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:36.530
is evolution in populations
where we have to really think

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.750
about stochastic dynamics.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.120
And now in general,
just like in the context

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.230
of gene networks within
cells, the situation

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.250
where we have to worry
about stochastic dynamics

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.570
is in the small
number kind of limit.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.690
What's perhaps surprising
about evolution

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.720
is that they're always--
the small numbers

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.570
are always important.

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.570
Even if you're in
a large population,

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.311
I'd say 10 to the 9 individuals,
if you want to study evolution,

00:01:04.311 --> 00:01:06.560
then you're interested in
cases where new mutants will

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.560
arise in the population.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.270
And kind of by definition,
those new mutants

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.040
start out as kind of a single
member of the population.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.450
Which means that in the
context of evolution,

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:22.490
we always have to think about
stochastic type dynamics.

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.500
Now the basic model that we're
going to use in this class

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.440
is the Moran process,
which is a model that

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.220
fixes population size.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.870
And then instead of having
discrete generations, where

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:38.414
all the individuals
are reproducing

00:01:38.414 --> 00:01:40.580
at the same time-- which
is what you might have seen

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.314
in the Wright-Fisher
process-- instead,

00:01:42.314 --> 00:01:43.980
we're going to think
about the situation

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.180
where it occurs more stepwise.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.390
In the sense that individuals
reproduce one at a time.

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.050
And then we contract the
dynamics of the population.

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.900
So we're going to think about
both the situation where we're

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.100
trying to understand neutral
dynamics, when we're tracking

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.850
the composition of a population
when the fitness of individuals

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.639
is equal or nearly equal.

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:10.199
But because in
stochastic dynamics,

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:12.250
there are interesting
things that happen.

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.750
But then we'll get
into the question

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.114
of non-neutral evolution.

00:02:15.114 --> 00:02:17.280
And really, we want to
consider both halves of that.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.020
All right, so in many cases,
in the context of evolution,

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.520
we're interested in, or
focused on beneficial mutants.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.939
Now for those
beneficial mutants,

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:27.730
one of the basic things
we're going to find

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:33.460
is that even beneficial mutants
will typically go extinct.

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.790
It doesn't mean that they're
not important over the long run.

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.690
But it does mean that
there is a very real sense

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.630
that randomness is
dominating the life of even

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.360
beneficial mutants.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.140
And then finally,
if there's time,

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.310
we will discuss this idea
of Muller's ratchet, which

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.770
is basically pointing
out that if there

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.190
are deleterious mutants or
mutations in the population,

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.300
those deleterious
mutations can in some cases

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:59.830
spread and fix in
the population.

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.550
And when that
happens, you can have

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.590
a decrease in the fitness
of a population over time.

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.020
And this is particularly
a strong effect

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.410
for small populations,
because small populations,

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.290
they're not as effective,
what you might call filters,

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:16.460
for selection.

00:03:19.054 --> 00:03:20.470
And so what we
want to do is start

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.011
by thinking about
this Moran process.

00:03:27.887 --> 00:03:29.470
And the key feature
here is that we're

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.840
going to have a constant
population size, constant N.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.060
And that's not
because we believe

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.550
that real populations always
have a fixed population size,

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:44.100
but rather, we want to
try to get some intuition

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.570
in this simple model.

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:47.950
And then of course, it's
reasonable to ask, well,

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.410
which aspects of the
mathematics or intuition

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.700
we develop are going to
change as a result of allowing

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.974
fluctuations in the
total population size?

00:03:56.974 --> 00:03:58.390
But I think there's
a lot of value

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.384
in starting out by analyzing
the simplest model that you can.

00:04:02.384 --> 00:04:03.800
So what we're going
to think about

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.380
is a situation where we
have a population composed

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:07.380
of N individuals.

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.930
And for now we'll just
consider two types, A and B.

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:16.890
And this is going to be a
model for asexually reproducing

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:17.589
populations.

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:19.440
Constant N, asexual.

00:04:22.964 --> 00:04:24.380
What that means
is, in particular,

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:29.710
that we're going to assume
that an A individual can

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.170
lead to two individuals.

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:36.130
Similarity, a B individual
can lead to two B individuals.

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.300
Right, so you can think about
this as, for example, a model

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.450
for how microbial
populations may evolve.

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.179
And for now, we will not
consider any mutations.

00:04:47.179 --> 00:04:49.470
All right, so we're going to
think about the process of

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.400
assume that those mutations
are already there.

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.510
So A and B could be different.

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:56.630
They could have, for
example, different--

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.270
they could be different
at some point mutation

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.940
side of some gene that
is relevant for growing

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:04.760
a low glucose
concentration, for example.

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.170
OK?

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:09.460
So here we're going to--
so this is birth slash

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.860
division, and in particular
here we're going to, for now,

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.420
assume no mutation.

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:17.200
So we'll assume that
A's always give birth

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.340
to A's, and B's always
give birth to B's.

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.330
We'll follow the
nomenclature from the reading

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.060
that you guys did last night,
Martin Nowak's book, chapter

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.230
six, where we're going
to think about-- we're

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:47.580
going to assume that there
are initially i A individuals,

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.610
and therefore, N
minus i B individuals.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:02.840
Now we'll assume that the basic
process for the-- in this Moran

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.630
process is that you have
reproduction, or birth, that's

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:08.695
proportional to fitness.

00:06:15.942 --> 00:06:17.400
And then the
resulting kind of what

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.170
you might call a daughter
cell replaces one member

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:21.670
of the population at random.

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:24.650
So there's birth and
then replacement.

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:27.360
And indeed we'll assume
that replacement,

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.860
that the daughter
cell, for example,

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:34.040
could even replace the
mother cell, if we want.

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.520
So this is just the birth.

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.645
So A is going to lead--
there's going to be two As,

00:06:37.645 --> 00:06:39.290
and this new A will
have to replace

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:41.570
one of the other individuals
in the population,

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:43.210
to keep constant
population size.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:47.846
All right.

00:06:47.846 --> 00:06:50.230
Are there any questions
about the basic model?

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.210
OK.

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:58.945
So that, in principle,
here we can use this model

00:06:58.945 --> 00:07:01.600
to try to understand both
neutral and non-neutral

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:02.100
evolution.

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:04.391
But let's start out by thinking
about the neutral case.

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:13.630
So in particular, the
fitness, rA is equal to rB.

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:19.600
Now what I want to do
is, given the rules we

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:24.730
just kind of laid out for you,
let's assume that i over n

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:28.790
is equal to one third.

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:32.870
So for now, we'll say, OK a
third of the population is A,

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:35.610
2/3 is then B.

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:38.640
And we can think about
these probabilities

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:41.230
of going from i to i
plus 1, as compared

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:44.210
to going from i to i minus 1.

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:48.280
So these are the probabilities
that in one cycle of birth

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:52.600
replacement, the number of A's
goes up one or goes down one.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:56.420
Can you ever go up two or three
or four in the Moran process

00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:57.500
in one step?

00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:58.300
No.

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:02.860
Because each step is always
one birth and one replacement.

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:04.240
So you can move, at most, one.

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:08.100
Do you always move--
does i change always?

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:09.489
No.

00:08:09.489 --> 00:08:11.280
And what we want to
know is the probability

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:16.620
of going from i to i plus 1,
as compared to the probability

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:18.680
of going from i to i minus one.

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.940
The ratio of these
probabilities is equal to what?

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:42.380
We're considering a case
where the A's and B's have

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:44.560
the same fitness,
so they're somehow

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:48.190
equal per capita probability
of being chosen to reproduce.

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:51.297
But there's-- but we're not
in a symmetric population

00:08:51.297 --> 00:08:52.130
distribution, right?

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:57.300
So 1/3 of the population
is A, 2/3 is B.

00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:00.800
So I'll give you 20 seconds
to think about this.

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:27.570
All right, do you
need more time?

00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:32.670
Everybody nod or shake.

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:35.490
Do you need more time?

00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:35.990
OK.

00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:37.990
I'll give you another 10
seconds, because it's--

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:51.350
Let's go ahead and
see where we are.

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:52.530
Ready?

00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:55.850
Three, two, one.

00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:56.510
All right.

00:09:56.510 --> 00:10:01.780
We have a wide range of
different answers here.

00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:03.020
OK, perfect.

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:06.599
This is exactly the
situation that we hope for.

00:10:06.599 --> 00:10:07.640
So turn to your neighbor.

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:09.420
You should certainly be
able to find somebody

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:10.480
that disagrees with you.

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:12.990
So if the first person you
turn to agrees with you,

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:14.699
try to find somebody
else talk to.

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:28.210
All right, why don't we
go ahead and reconvene.

00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:30.606
I know that there was quite
a lot of disagreement,

00:11:30.606 --> 00:11:32.480
so that means that you
guys will probably not

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:35.280
be able to converge in
this one minute time frame.

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:39.160
But let me just see, let
me see if anybody's mind

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:40.550
was changed by their neighbors.

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:42.190
All right, let's re-vote.

00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:45.730
Ready, three, two, one.

00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:50.330
OK, all right, so
it's pretty much

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:53.270
the same as where
we started, maybe.

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:54.970
All right.

00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:57.610
OK I would say-- does
anybody want to volunteer

00:11:57.610 --> 00:11:59.747
what their neighbor said?

00:11:59.747 --> 00:12:01.080
I know what your neighbors said.

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:03.550
So tell us.

00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:07.130
AUDIENCE: OK, so if you--
so I would say it's E.

00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:09.130
And the reason is that--
so there are two cases.

00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:12.260
In the first case, both the
number A and B stay the same.

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:15.050
Right, for example, A
gets born and A dies.

00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:18.226
So you first decide, is the
pop-- is the number of A and B

00:12:18.226 --> 00:12:20.499
going to change, or is
it not going to change?

00:12:20.499 --> 00:12:21.082
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:12:21.082 --> 00:12:22.873
AUDIENCE: Once you've
decided that it's not

00:12:22.873 --> 00:12:24.550
going to change-- I'm sorry.

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:25.750
Once you've decided that
it is going to change--

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:26.690
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:28.481
AUDIENCE: --then you
just want to know, OK,

00:12:28.481 --> 00:12:31.762
then what's the probability
that you just choose A to change

00:12:31.762 --> 00:12:33.590
[INAUDIBLE].

00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:35.051
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:12:35.051 --> 00:12:35.550
Yeah.

00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:37.542
AUDIENCE: And then the
probability that A--

00:12:37.542 --> 00:12:38.540
you choose--

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:39.520
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:42.590
But you haven't said anything
about replacement yet.

00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:46.830
So I'm-- replacement should
be-- because certainly,

00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:49.620
we're talking about the ratio of
the probability that the number

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:52.120
of A goes up, as compared to
the probability that the number

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:52.810
of A goes down.

00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:53.310
Right?

00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:56.160
So we've already, in some
ways, excluded the cases

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:59.540
where the number of A
individuals doesn't change.

00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:02.300
And in your-- what
you just told us,

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:03.790
you're asking about
the probability

00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:08.831
that individuals are going
to be chosen to reproduce.

00:13:08.831 --> 00:13:11.657
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
because [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:11.657 --> 00:13:12.240
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:13.465
Yeah, but I guess
all I'm saying is

00:13:13.465 --> 00:13:14.850
that there're going to be
two halves to this, right?

00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:15.990
So you have to think
about the probability

00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:18.910
that an individual is being
chosen to reproduce, and also

00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:22.440
the probability that a
particular type of individual

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:24.260
will be chosen to get replaced.

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.660
So it's the-- there's somehow
a balance of those two.

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:28.004
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:28.004 --> 00:13:29.670
PROFESSOR: Right,
because in this case--

00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:30.180
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] replace--

00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:33.340
PROFESSOR: --replace, this is--
right, death, slash-- right.

00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:35.680
And I should maybe just
highlight-- if you want,

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:37.490
you could call--
replacement-- I mean,

00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:40.566
this is just a nice way
of saying death, right?

00:13:40.566 --> 00:13:41.065
Death--

00:13:44.641 --> 00:13:45.640
AUDIENCE: Yeah, you can.

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:48.150
I mean, [? the point ?]
[? is ?] once you've ruled out--

00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:49.941
once you say, OK, the
populations are going

00:13:49.941 --> 00:13:53.940
to change, then if you choose an
A to reproduce, a B has to die.

00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:55.836
PROFESSOR: Oh, OK,
once you've already--

00:13:55.836 --> 00:13:57.544
AUDIENCE: If an A is
chosen to reproduce,

00:13:57.544 --> 00:13:59.040
and an A is chosen
to die, then--

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:00.489
PROFESSOR: OK, yeah, right.

00:14:00.489 --> 00:14:02.530
But, OK, I think I understand
what you're saying.

00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:05.000
But we-- you still have
to keep track of there

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.060
are the two sides.

00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:07.810
There's the replace--
there's the birth,

00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:08.685
and the replacements.

00:14:08.685 --> 00:14:12.180
And we have to figure out how
the relative probabilities

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:14.144
or rates that those
two things happen.

00:14:14.144 --> 00:14:16.560
Does somebody want to make an
argument for something else?

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:18.737
I mean, we'll see how this
plays out in a moment.

00:14:18.737 --> 00:14:20.078
AUDIENCE: I want to argue for C.

00:14:20.078 --> 00:14:21.420
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:22.859
AUDIENCE: So take the numerator.

00:14:22.859 --> 00:14:23.525
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:14:23.525 --> 00:14:26.000
AUDIENCE: In order to
go from i to i plus 1--

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.857
so we're going to
take two individuals

00:14:27.857 --> 00:14:28.690
from the population.

00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:31.695
We need one of them to be
type A, that's the one that's

00:14:31.695 --> 00:14:32.514
going to reproduce.

00:14:32.514 --> 00:14:33.005
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:14:33.005 --> 00:14:34.478
AUDIENCE: And the other to
be type B, the one that's

00:14:34.478 --> 00:14:35.019
going to die.

00:14:35.019 --> 00:14:35.951
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:14:35.951 --> 00:14:37.430
AUDIENCE: So we get
the product of those--

00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:37.840
PROFESSOR: Perfect.

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:38.220
OK.

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:40.750
And we can actually just be
more-- be explicit about this.

00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:43.880
OK, so the probability-- in
one cycle, the probability

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:45.680
that you go from
i to i plus one.

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:48.690
That requires that
two things happen.

00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:52.550
One is that you choose an
A individual to reproduce.

00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:54.300
And what's the probability
that you choose

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:55.520
an A individual to reproduce?

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:57.019
AUDIENCE: It's going
to be i over N.

00:14:57.019 --> 00:15:00.450
PROFESSOR: i over N. So
we have i over N. Right,

00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:08.350
so this the probability
that A reproduces.

00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:12.370
And then for i to go
from-- to increase by one,

00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:15.020
requires not only that
an A individual is chosen

00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:17.880
to reproduce, but that
a B individual is chosen

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:19.910
for replacement, or death.

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:22.217
And what's the probability
that that's going to happen?

00:15:22.217 --> 00:15:24.960
AUDIENCE: That's N
minus i all over N.

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:30.720
PROFESSOR: N minus
i, all over N. OK.

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:34.680
So this is the probability
that in one cycle

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:37.380
you're going to go
from i to i plus 1.

00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:40.570
Now of course it's
not-- we haven't

00:15:40.570 --> 00:15:42.520
said what the probability
of staying in i is,

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:45.050
but this is the probability
that i will increase by one.

00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:51.380
Do we agree?

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:53.480
And indeed, where is it
that we've assumed-- where

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:58.400
is it that we've assumed
neutrality in this calculation?

00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:02.606
That A and B have equal fitness?

00:16:02.606 --> 00:16:03.106
Yep?

00:16:03.106 --> 00:16:05.189
AUDIENCE: Just take the
probability of reproducing

00:16:05.189 --> 00:16:06.890
to be about-- or, the--

00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:08.020
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:08.980
That's right.

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:13.090
So indeed, we've-- this
probability that A reproduces,

00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:15.630
we've assumed that it's just
simply i over N. Whereas,

00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:18.380
if it were non-neutral we'd
have to write something else.

00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:20.838
Maybe we'll figure out what
that's going to be in a moment.

00:16:20.838 --> 00:16:22.710
But it's in here that
we've assumed that.

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:24.150
Incidentally, you
could write down

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:26.710
a reasonable model similar
to the Moran process,

00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:29.110
where differences
in fitness show up

00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:31.680
instead of here, in the
probability of reproduction,

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:34.620
you can have it as a difference
in probability of death,

00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:35.966
or being replaced.

00:16:35.966 --> 00:16:37.632
But this is the most
maybe intuitive way

00:16:37.632 --> 00:16:39.342
of thinking about it.

00:16:39.342 --> 00:16:41.050
And this is very
similar to, for example,

00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:46.660
what happens in a,
what you might call,

00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:50.530
a turbidostat, where you keep
constant population size.

00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:55.630
And as the cells divide other
cells are randomly sucked out.

00:16:55.630 --> 00:17:00.110
So I'd say that this
Moran process is really

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:03.000
a theoretical kind
of implementation

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.500
of what you could
do experimentally,

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:05.569
is this turbidostat.

00:17:05.569 --> 00:17:07.230
Which is like a
chemostat, instead

00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:11.653
of keeping constant dilution
rate, you fix population size.

00:17:11.653 --> 00:17:12.152
Yes.

00:17:12.152 --> 00:17:16.274
AUDIENCE: So do we care about
the step of, OK, first A

00:17:16.274 --> 00:17:17.010
reproduces.

00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:19.545
Then, from the pool
of new individuals--

00:17:19.545 --> 00:17:22.760
because you're going
to have N plus 1, so--

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:24.055
PROFESSOR: OK, so all right.

00:17:24.055 --> 00:17:25.930
I think maybe I wasn't
totally clear on this.

00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:27.535
OK so, you have N
individuals here.

00:17:27.535 --> 00:17:28.910
What you're going
to do is you're

00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:30.940
going to choose one
of them randomly,

00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:33.070
maybe proportional to
fitness for reproduction.

00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:34.910
And then, but then,
from this original N,

00:17:34.910 --> 00:17:37.230
you choose one of
them for death.

00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:38.480
So it's not-- you're not, yes.

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:41.650
It's not-- so the daughter
cell is not allowed to--

00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:42.252
AUDIENCE: Die.

00:17:42.252 --> 00:17:42.960
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:44.990
The daughter cell always
replaces somebody,

00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:46.632
but it could've been
the mother cell.

00:17:46.632 --> 00:17:48.840
If we're thinking about this
in the context of cells.

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:57.660
So we haven't yet figured out
which answer is which, right?

00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:59.044
But we can go ahead.

00:17:59.044 --> 00:18:00.960
OK, this is the probability
that A reproduces,

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:03.460
and over here, this
is the probability

00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:06.611
that a B individual is replaced.

00:18:06.611 --> 00:18:07.110
Right?

00:18:13.182 --> 00:18:14.640
What we can do is,
we can ask, well

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:18.780
what's the probability that
we go from i to i minus 1?

00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:21.272
Well it's the exact kind
of same calculation,

00:18:21.272 --> 00:18:22.730
except now what we
want to know is,

00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:24.970
we want to know the
probability that a B is

00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:26.952
chosen for reproduction.

00:18:26.952 --> 00:18:28.160
And what is that going to be?

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:28.660
Somebody?

00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:34.430
N minus i, right, the
number of B individuals

00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:36.550
divided by the total
number of individuals.

00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:40.170
So this is the probability
that a B reproduces.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.470
And then what's the
probability that A--

00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:47.360
that an A type
individual will be chosen

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:51.000
for replacement or death?

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.090
That's just i over N. The
number of A individuals divided

00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:55.310
by the total population size.

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:08.220
All right, does everybody
agree with the two calculations

00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:08.930
that we just did?

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:13.160
Let's re-vote.

00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:20.955
All right, ready,
three, two, one.

00:19:20.955 --> 00:19:23.080
All right, see, you know,
if we do the calculation,

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:24.470
we can convince you.

00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:28.040
So indeed, these are equal,
these two probabilities.

00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:34.930
Right, and this is funny.

00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:38.560
Because on the one hand it's
like blindingly obvious,

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:40.880
but then the other hand,
you get yourself all tied up

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:42.005
in knots thinking about it.

00:19:42.005 --> 00:19:45.750
So I don't understand why or
how those two statements can

00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:50.090
be true at the same
time, but they are.

00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:55.420
So this is indeed a
random walk in i space,

00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:56.420
number of A individuals.

00:20:01.314 --> 00:20:03.230
And it sort of has to
be, because these things

00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:04.340
are neutral.

00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:07.610
The fact that i over N
is not equal to a half

00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:11.230
doesn't matter, because these
two terms kind of cancel.

00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:14.240
But indeed, all of the things
that you know have to be true

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:19.040
based on the fact that A
and B have equal fitness,

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:22.920
they're going to not work if
this thing were not equal to 1,

00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:25.550
if these two probabilities
were not equal.

00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:28.751
So any of these other answers
would lead to things that you

00:20:28.751 --> 00:20:30.750
would clearly agree are
going to be nonsensical,

00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:34.110
if you think through
the consequence of this.

00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:35.610
And we're going to
do one right now.

00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:49.010
All right, let's imagine
that we start-- so here's

00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:53.060
the number of A individuals, i.

00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:55.060
I apologize that that's
the nomenclature we

00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:57.720
have for a number
of A individuals,

00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:01.320
but we want to be consistent
with Martin's book.

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:07.660
Now let's say this
is N and let's say

00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:12.250
we start out at some i here.

00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:16.855
The question is, what's the
probability that B fixes?

00:21:16.855 --> 00:21:19.230
I want to make sure I write
down some reasonable options.

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:30.680
So what we want to know is
the probability that B fixes,

00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:36.560
and that means that it
takes over eventually.

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:38.050
That B, we'll say eventually.

00:21:45.210 --> 00:21:49.270
In the Moran process
with neutral dynamics.

00:22:15.266 --> 00:22:18.160
AUDIENCE: I's the
number of A, right?

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:19.580
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:23.320
i is the number
of A individuals.

00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:45.125
I'm going to give you
seven more seconds.

00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:05.336
All right, ready,
three, two, one.

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:11.260
All right, so we have-- it's
kind of mostly split between

00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:12.354
C's and D's.

00:23:12.354 --> 00:23:14.770
Although I'd say a majority
of the group is going to say--

00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:20.330
is saying that it's going to be
D. All right, can-- all right,

00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:24.940
and this is the distinction
between the probability that B

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:27.424
fixes and that A fixes.

00:23:27.424 --> 00:23:28.840
I'm not trying to
be super tricky,

00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:30.839
but I just want to make
sure that you keep track

00:23:30.839 --> 00:23:33.580
of A's and B's.

00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:38.590
And in particular,
as i increases,

00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:41.660
the probability that A
fixes should go up or down?

00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:44.033
Verbally, three, two, one.

00:23:44.033 --> 00:23:44.880
AUDIENCE: Up.

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:47.270
PROFESSOR: Up.

00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:52.070
This here-- over here is a bunch
of A's, here is a bunch of B's.

00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:54.010
So if you have a
larger here, than you

00:23:54.010 --> 00:24:00.560
should be more likely to fix
the A individuals, vice versa.

00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:04.510
So in particular, this-- the
probability that B eventually

00:24:04.510 --> 00:24:07.820
fixes is going to be this,
whereas the probability that A

00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:12.100
will fix eventually is just
going to be 1 minus that,

00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:13.020
it's i over N.

00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:18.910
So this is indeed what was
pointed out in the book.

00:24:18.910 --> 00:24:24.040
All right, and can somebody
give an argument, verbally,

00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:26.480
for why the-- I mean,
this is a result,

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:29.350
that if you think
about in the right way,

00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:32.640
you can just verbally say
why it has to be this.

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:39.442
Rather than writing down all
the equations that-- so why

00:24:39.442 --> 00:24:41.650
is it that the probability
that A will eventually fix

00:24:41.650 --> 00:24:42.816
has to be equal to i over N?

00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:49.568
Yeah.

00:24:49.568 --> 00:24:51.660
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] book.

00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:54.480
PROFESSOR: Yeah, perfect.

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:57.480
AUDIENCE: So at this given
time, there are N individuals--

00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:58.755
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:24:58.755 --> 00:25:00.380
And there will always
be N individuals,

00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:01.463
because we're keeping it--

00:25:01.463 --> 00:25:04.590
AUDIENCE: OK, yeah, right.

00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:06.410
Their descendents,
at some point,

00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:08.354
the descendents
of one of them is

00:25:08.354 --> 00:25:10.020
going to take over
the whole population.

00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:10.645
That's a given.

00:25:10.645 --> 00:25:12.460
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:13.690
And that's fine.

00:25:13.690 --> 00:25:16.530
It's at first glance
kind of surprising

00:25:16.530 --> 00:25:22.817
but, it's just the nature of--
if you imagine that they all

00:25:22.817 --> 00:25:24.900
were individually tagged,
right, so it wasn't just

00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:26.900
that we had two types, A
and B. But if they were

00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:30.390
all color coded
using rainbow colors,

00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:32.410
then you could
keep track of them.

00:25:32.410 --> 00:25:37.850
And one of the individuals
will eventually fix.

00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:40.612
Now, OK, and then what's next?

00:25:40.612 --> 00:25:42.590
AUDIENCE: So there
are i individuals

00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:46.980
that are type A,
so the probability

00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:51.150
that this one individual
[INAUDIBLE] will fix.

00:25:51.150 --> 00:25:54.790
PROFESSOR: And then there is
one ingredient in that argument

00:25:54.790 --> 00:25:57.170
that you didn't say, but
I'm sure is in your mind.

00:25:57.170 --> 00:25:59.890
Which is, how is it that
the probability-- so

00:25:59.890 --> 00:26:02.930
among these N
individuals, right?

00:26:02.930 --> 00:26:04.840
One of them will eventually fix.

00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:08.480
And what's the
probability that each one

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:12.408
will be the lucky ancestor
for all of the population?

00:26:12.408 --> 00:26:13.991
AUDIENCE: So it's
equally distributed.

00:26:13.991 --> 00:26:14.657
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:26:14.657 --> 00:26:15.860
It's just 1 over N, right?

00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:18.235
So the idea is there are N
individuals in the population,

00:26:18.235 --> 00:26:19.762
they're all identical.

00:26:19.762 --> 00:26:21.220
We know that
eventually one of them

00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:23.450
is going to take over
the population, just

00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:25.694
due to random
stochastic dynamics.

00:26:25.694 --> 00:26:27.485
What that means is that
each individual has

00:26:27.485 --> 00:26:32.760
a probability of 1 over N of
taking over the population.

00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:35.220
And this is very important.

00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:46.480
So each individual has a 1
over N probability of fixing.

00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:53.150
And that's assuming that
everybody in the population

00:26:53.150 --> 00:26:54.980
has the same fitness.

00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:57.819
And that's just by symmetry.

00:26:57.819 --> 00:26:59.610
But then of course,
you can also say, well,

00:26:59.610 --> 00:27:02.870
you know if the probability of
each individual is 1 over N,

00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:07.160
then the probability that one of
these i individuals takes over

00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:11.969
is going to be i over N.

00:27:11.969 --> 00:27:14.404
AUDIENCE: The
generalization [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:14.404 --> 00:27:17.813
reproducing organisms is
that [INAUDIBLE] organisms

00:27:17.813 --> 00:27:21.709
every individual is probably
the ancestor of [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:21.709 --> 00:27:25.150
Like ever individual
takes [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:25.150 --> 00:27:26.230
PROFESSOR: OK, all right.

00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:29.610
OK, now you want to
allow for recombination.

00:27:29.610 --> 00:27:30.550
Is that--

00:27:30.550 --> 00:27:31.816
AUDIENCE: I mean, yeah.

00:27:31.816 --> 00:27:32.690
PROFESSOR: Right, OK.

00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:36.960
So yes, there are several
important aspects of sex.

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:39.420
But one of the major ones
is the recombination.

00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:43.530
And so if you have
enough recombination,

00:27:43.530 --> 00:27:47.950
then everybody will
contribute-- well, everybody.

00:27:47.950 --> 00:27:51.100
Then there will be-- then
many, many individuals

00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:53.860
will contribute to
the [? lineage. ?]

00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:56.190
What you often will
hear people talk about

00:27:56.190 --> 00:28:01.120
is the ancestral Adam
and the ancestral Eve.

00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:04.250
And that-- and what are people
referring to about that?

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:11.130
Yes, in the back.

00:28:11.130 --> 00:28:17.539
AUDIENCE: An individual
with the-- an individual

00:28:17.539 --> 00:28:23.455
that [INAUDIBLE]
early on [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:27.390
PROFESSOR: Yes, right.

00:28:27.390 --> 00:28:29.150
So there's this
idea-- OK, so I don't

00:28:29.150 --> 00:28:31.340
want to get too much into
the sexual-- sexually

00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:32.980
reproducing populations
because that's

00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:34.590
covered more in other classes.

00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:38.370
And it's a totally different
models you would typically use.

00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:41.230
But I think the simplest
way to think about some

00:28:41.230 --> 00:28:45.740
of this is just that there's
some part the genome that

00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:48.260
does not have recombination
in the same way.

00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:49.650
So it's simpler.

00:28:49.650 --> 00:28:52.512
What part of the
genome is that in us?

00:28:52.512 --> 00:28:53.470
AUDIENCE: Y chromosome.

00:28:53.470 --> 00:28:54.178
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:28:54.178 --> 00:28:57.170
So the Y chromosome, and that
means that in principle you

00:28:57.170 --> 00:29:02.340
could track the dynamics
along the male lineages.

00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:05.920
So there are all these studies,
whatever, Genghis Khan, maybe

00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:08.240
lots of us are descendants of.

00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:11.550
Right, because he had lots of
wives, or something like that.

00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:14.810
So his Y chromosome
supposedly occupies

00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:18.490
a non negligible fraction
of the population.

00:29:18.490 --> 00:29:21.480
OK, so but then what
about-- what's the other,

00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:23.340
yeah, so on the female side?

00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:24.642
What would be the equivalent?

00:29:24.642 --> 00:29:25.600
AUDIENCE: Mitochondria.

00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:26.690
PROFESSOR: Mitochondria.

00:29:26.690 --> 00:29:27.190
Right.

00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:29.270
So in principle,
you can-- so I think

00:29:29.270 --> 00:29:32.140
for an awful lot of
these studies you can--

00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:37.290
the genetics are much simpler
for those two lineages.

00:29:37.290 --> 00:29:39.500
Because you don't have
the recombination.

00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:42.410
AUDIENCE: So why is the
mitochondria-- I mean,

00:29:42.410 --> 00:29:45.025
you say that it's the
most obvious thing.

00:29:45.025 --> 00:29:45.900
PROFESSOR: OK, yeah--

00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:47.919
AUDIENCE: I've never heard that.

00:29:47.919 --> 00:29:49.210
PROFESSOR: Yeah, OK, OK, right.

00:29:49.210 --> 00:29:49.525
So--

00:29:49.525 --> 00:29:50.130
AUDIENCE: I mean,
we don't have to--

00:29:50.130 --> 00:29:51.546
PROFESSOR: OK,
well, you're right.

00:29:51.546 --> 00:29:55.880
So basically the situation
is that we have cells,

00:29:55.880 --> 00:30:00.670
and most of the genome
is in the nucleus.

00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:02.510
But then, but the
mitochondria actually

00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:06.350
have their own
mitochondrial DNA.

00:30:06.350 --> 00:30:09.664
And then the issue is,
OK, well, what happens?

00:30:09.664 --> 00:30:11.830
You know, here's the birds
and the bees talk for you

00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:12.530
guys, all right?

00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:18.510
Right, so the sperm
comes, fertilizes the egg.

00:30:18.510 --> 00:30:25.570
And the vast majority
of the mitochondria

00:30:25.570 --> 00:30:28.130
come from, or were
in the egg, as

00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:30.000
compared to the
mitochondria from the sperm.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.640
And I don't-- does anybody
know if any of the sperm

00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:35.770
mitochondria
actually contribute?

00:30:35.770 --> 00:30:38.645
Are they selectively-- does
something happen to them?

00:30:38.645 --> 00:30:40.070
AUDIENCE: They don't have any.

00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:41.000
PROFESSOR: Oh, they
just don't have any?

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.120
All right, whoo.

00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:43.770
All right, well, OK.

00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:48.630
OK, well that
solves that problem.

00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:49.536
OK.

00:30:49.536 --> 00:30:51.820
AUDIENCE: Wait.

00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:55.940
PROFESSOR: Is that not your--
all right, well-- all right,

00:30:55.940 --> 00:30:59.030
this is the kind of thing that
somebody could maybe Wikipedia

00:30:59.030 --> 00:31:01.550
this while we're going.

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:06.205
But that's the
basic idea, though.

00:31:10.090 --> 00:31:12.621
All right, does anybody have
any questions about these two

00:31:12.621 --> 00:31:13.120
statements?

00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:16.550
Probability that A fixes,
probability that B fixes?

00:31:19.690 --> 00:31:23.830
Incidentally, you should be
able to draw-- these are random.

00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:29.430
From this point moving forward,
am I more likely-- OK, so

00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:32.950
given where i is here, am I
more likely to fix B or A?

00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:34.490
Ready, three, two, one.

00:31:34.490 --> 00:31:34.990
AUDIENCE: B.

00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:37.560
PROFESSOR: B. Does that
mean that my first step is

00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:39.920
more likely to be in the
direction of B than in A?

00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:40.420
Yes or no.

00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:41.719
Ready, three, two, one.

00:31:41.719 --> 00:31:42.260
AUDIENCE: No.

00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:43.070
PROFESSOR: No.

00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:45.160
OK, so this is a random lock.

00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:47.060
All right, it doesn't
always take steps,

00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:49.660
but sometimes it goes
up and then down.

00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:53.184
All right, so it's going
to- now I'm-- you know,

00:31:53.184 --> 00:31:55.300
I understand it's not
to-- you know, whatever.

00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:55.800
OK.

00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:04.510
But the idea is
that once it hits

00:32:04.510 --> 00:32:06.264
0 or 1 here in terms
of the fraction,

00:32:06.264 --> 00:32:07.430
then you stay where you are.

00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:08.721
These are absorbing boundaries.

00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:17.756
But every now and then
it's going to hit there.

00:32:23.250 --> 00:32:25.610
Before we get going
too much more in this,

00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:28.560
I want to mention something
about time in this model.

00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:32.520
Because time is a little
bit of a funny entity here.

00:32:35.082 --> 00:32:36.040
So here's the question.

00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:41.020
How long-- and long is
funny-- but how long

00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:43.740
does one-- I don't know.

00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:45.882
Do we want to call this
an iteration or a cycle?

00:32:45.882 --> 00:32:47.160
On iteration of the model?

00:32:58.130 --> 00:33:01.060
And what I mean by that is
that in units of something that

00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:06.920
would be like real time,
you know what I mean?

00:33:12.670 --> 00:33:21.289
Is it a second, a
generation time-- so this

00:33:21.289 --> 00:33:22.830
would be like a cell
generation time.

00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:44.360
Or don't know, something.

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:46.900
OK, I'll give you 15 seconds.

00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:48.950
Can you guys all read this?

00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:52.690
Seconds, generation time, N
times generation time, or 1

00:33:52.690 --> 00:33:55.716
over N times generation time.

00:33:55.716 --> 00:33:58.244
AUDIENCE: What do
we want [INAUDIBLE]?

00:33:58.244 --> 00:33:59.910
PROFESSOR: Yeah, well
let's say that I--

00:33:59.910 --> 00:34:02.190
let's just imagine that
I was using this to model

00:34:02.190 --> 00:34:06.410
the dynamics of
the neutral drift

00:34:06.410 --> 00:34:12.020
dynamics of some bacteria
in my test tube in the lab.

00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:14.300
Right, so let's say I have
one of these tubridostats.

00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:16.429
So I-- question is,
how long does this

00:34:16.429 --> 00:34:20.288
last in the units of-- right.

00:34:20.288 --> 00:34:21.704
Or equivalent, how
many iterations

00:34:21.704 --> 00:34:27.420
do I have to go to get through
some period of time in the lab.

00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:30.989
So I grow my bacteria
in my turbidostat, say.

00:34:30.989 --> 00:34:34.469
And I do it for 100 hours.

00:34:34.469 --> 00:34:37.940
Now your advisor says,
OK, go do a simulation,

00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:39.171
so you get something.

00:34:39.171 --> 00:34:41.420
And your advisor goes, all
right, do a simulation, use

00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:43.590
the Moran process.

00:34:43.590 --> 00:34:45.090
You guys are going
to be doing this,

00:34:45.090 --> 00:34:47.600
so this is not
entirely hypothetical.

00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:53.731
But right, so your advisor
says, go simulate this process.

00:34:53.731 --> 00:34:54.230
Right?

00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:56.300
So the question is,
how many iterations

00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:59.320
do you have to do to make it
equivalent to that 100 hours

00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:00.680
that you did in the lab?

00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:03.500
How do you-- how do
you make a connection

00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:07.170
between a model, well,
this model, and something

00:35:07.170 --> 00:35:08.920
that actually happens
in your laboratory?

00:35:15.470 --> 00:35:17.110
Ready?

00:35:17.110 --> 00:35:21.505
Three, two, one.

00:35:21.505 --> 00:35:23.880
OK, all right, so we got a
majority of the group agreeing

00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:28.466
that it's going to be D. Can
somebody just say why this is?

00:35:28.466 --> 00:35:30.936
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
one cell [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:34.030 --> 00:35:35.980
PROFESSOR: Right, so
each iteration, there's

00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:40.831
only one cell out of N that
actually divide, right?

00:35:40.831 --> 00:35:43.330
And that means that if you want,
like for example, everybody

00:35:43.330 --> 00:35:45.070
to have had a chance,
roughly, to divide,

00:35:45.070 --> 00:35:47.580
you need to go N iterations.

00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:50.770
And it also makes
sense, if you ask--

00:35:50.770 --> 00:35:57.200
let's imagine you have a test
tube with a million bacteria.

00:35:57.200 --> 00:36:00.710
Now it's going to take some
time before one of them divides.

00:36:00.710 --> 00:36:04.180
Now the question is, if
you had 10 million bacteria

00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:06.070
in your test tube,
you have to wait 1/10

00:36:06.070 --> 00:36:10.340
as long before the
first one divides.

00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:12.550
So the amount of real
time that elapses

00:36:12.550 --> 00:36:15.280
in each one of these
iterations goes as 1 over N,

00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:19.300
where N is the population size.

00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:22.240
So I got some unhappy
looks, so that means that I

00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:24.890
expect an unhappy question.

00:36:24.890 --> 00:36:25.390
Maybe.

00:36:30.374 --> 00:36:32.040
OK, well, if you don't
ask the question,

00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:33.510
then in the teaching
evaluations you're

00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:35.051
not allowed to write
that you did not

00:36:35.051 --> 00:36:39.716
like the explanation of
time in the Moran process.

00:36:39.716 --> 00:36:40.632
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:40.632 --> 00:36:42.602
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:42.602 --> 00:36:43.810
PROFESSOR: Well, that worked.

00:36:43.810 --> 00:36:46.103
A little bit too well.

00:36:46.103 --> 00:36:48.311
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
question, just a clarification.

00:36:48.311 --> 00:36:49.297
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:36:49.297 --> 00:36:51.515
AUDIENCE: So an
iteration is when

00:36:51.515 --> 00:36:54.432
one cell or thing increases?

00:36:54.432 --> 00:36:55.140
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:36:55.140 --> 00:36:57.880
OK, an iteration in this
model is both of these things.

00:36:57.880 --> 00:37:01.470
So it's a birth, and a
death, or a replacement.

00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:03.950
So it's one duration here,
another-- so each iteration

00:37:03.950 --> 00:37:07.566
involves one birth
and one replacement.

00:37:07.566 --> 00:37:08.066
Yeah.

00:37:08.066 --> 00:37:10.010
AUDIENCE: What is
one generation time?

00:37:10.010 --> 00:37:11.874
Is that when the
population [INAUDIBLE]?

00:37:11.874 --> 00:37:13.540
PROFESSOR: Right, so
the generation time

00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:16.580
is the typical
time that it takes

00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:18.330
for one of these
individuals to give birth

00:37:18.330 --> 00:37:19.470
to another individual.

00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:22.080
So in the case of the cells,
it might be half an hour.

00:37:27.830 --> 00:37:30.375
I'm going to try to leave this
up just so that you guys can

00:37:30.375 --> 00:37:31.340
continue to look a bit.

00:37:44.942 --> 00:37:46.900
So I want to say just
something about this idea

00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:50.360
of a molecular clock
while we're here.

00:38:06.869 --> 00:38:08.660
All right, so now that
we've said something

00:38:08.660 --> 00:38:11.880
about how much time is
actually elapsing here,

00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:14.450
we can think a little
bit about the rate--

00:38:14.450 --> 00:38:18.110
now we want to allow mutations.

00:38:18.110 --> 00:38:25.970
So let's assume that there is
a mutation rate or probability.

00:38:25.970 --> 00:38:33.642
Mu is the probability
of a mutation.

00:38:33.642 --> 00:38:35.725
And we're going to say
this is a neutral mutation.

00:38:39.630 --> 00:38:43.680
And this is per
division, or per birth.

00:38:48.690 --> 00:38:50.940
So the idea is that
when-- all right,

00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:53.040
we might start out with
just all A individuals

00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:55.314
in the population.

00:38:55.314 --> 00:38:58.560
But then an A individual
will give-- OK,

00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:00.602
here is the mother
cell, the original A.

00:39:00.602 --> 00:39:02.060
And the mother
cell, for now, we'll

00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:03.970
assume just doesn't ever mutate.

00:39:03.970 --> 00:39:06.710
But that the daughter
cell has a probability,

00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:15.450
mu, of being a new type,
say B. And we often

00:39:15.450 --> 00:39:20.950
call this a mutation rate, but
it's a probability per birth.

00:39:25.584 --> 00:39:27.000
So what we want
to know is what is

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.580
the what we want to
calculate is what's

00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:35.700
the rate at which new
neutral mutants both appear

00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:38.500
and then fix in the population.

00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:44.190
So what we're asking about
is, from the standpoint of us

00:39:44.190 --> 00:39:47.910
as scientists, we do sequencing
of different lineages,

00:39:47.910 --> 00:39:49.390
say humans and chimpanzees.

00:39:49.390 --> 00:39:51.635
And we're looking at the
accumulation of these, what

00:39:51.635 --> 00:39:53.440
we think are neutral mutations.

00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:56.460
Question is, how many neutral
mutations do we expect to see?

00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:02.420
So we need to know the rate
that these things happen.

00:40:07.470 --> 00:40:12.530
So this is the rate of
fixation of neutral mutations,

00:40:12.530 --> 00:40:17.200
and so this is somehow the
rate of neutral evolution.

00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:19.867
There are two steps in here.

00:40:19.867 --> 00:40:21.700
What are the two things
that have to happen?

00:40:25.524 --> 00:40:26.634
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:26.634 --> 00:40:28.050
PROFESSOR: Right,
needs to appear.

00:40:28.050 --> 00:40:30.607
So we'll call this the
rate of appearance.

00:40:30.607 --> 00:40:32.190
And then what else
do we need to know?

00:40:42.669 --> 00:40:43.929
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:43.929 --> 00:40:45.345
PROFESSOR: I'm
sorry, what's that?

00:40:45.345 --> 00:40:46.429
AUDIENCE: Population size.

00:40:46.429 --> 00:40:48.136
PROFESSOR: Right, so
the population size.

00:40:48.136 --> 00:40:49.430
And why are you saying that?

00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:52.780
Or what's-- I mean, the
population size is certainly

00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:56.180
going to be relevant, but
I guess the question is,

00:40:56.180 --> 00:40:58.630
will the rate of
neutral evolution,

00:40:58.630 --> 00:41:02.849
the rate in which you see
neutral mutants in a lineage,

00:41:02.849 --> 00:41:05.390
will that be just equal to this,
or do we need to multiply it

00:41:05.390 --> 00:41:05.800
by something else?

00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:06.410
Yeah.

00:41:06.410 --> 00:41:07.330
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:07.330 --> 00:41:07.600
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:09.150
And it's a rate of fixation.

00:41:09.150 --> 00:41:11.840
We'll say it's really kind
of a probability of fixation.

00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:13.830
Because there's some
rate per unit time.

00:41:13.830 --> 00:41:15.663
Maybe even like real
time in terms of number

00:41:15.663 --> 00:41:16.890
of generations in real time.

00:41:16.890 --> 00:41:18.973
But we need to know the
probability that it fixes.

00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:31.142
Great.

00:41:31.142 --> 00:41:32.850
So let's-- all right,
we're going to do--

00:41:32.850 --> 00:41:35.550
we're going to do a very
detailed calculation here.

00:41:35.550 --> 00:41:36.365
Yes.

00:41:36.365 --> 00:41:39.490
AUDIENCE: So I'm just
curious, [INAUDIBLE] for this

00:41:39.490 --> 00:41:43.330
probability [INAUDIBLE]
time is completely left out

00:41:43.330 --> 00:41:44.770
of the picture,
so in principle--

00:41:44.770 --> 00:41:46.322
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:41:46.322 --> 00:41:48.178
AUDIENCE: --it could
take a very long time.

00:41:48.178 --> 00:41:49.178
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:41:49.178 --> 00:41:52.510
AUDIENCE: But we don't take
this into account because--

00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:53.910
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:41:53.910 --> 00:42:00.380
So for now, let's just assume
that the rate of appearance

00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:03.770
of these is small,
so that you don't

00:42:03.770 --> 00:42:07.339
have to worry about
different mutants competing

00:42:07.339 --> 00:42:08.130
against each other.

00:42:08.130 --> 00:42:09.562
We're going to
spend a lot of time

00:42:09.562 --> 00:42:11.270
on Thursday talking
about this phenomenon

00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:14.140
of clonal interference, when
multiple mutant lineages are

00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:16.722
coexisting and perhaps
competing in a population.

00:42:16.722 --> 00:42:19.180
But for simplicity for now,
what we're just going to assume

00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:22.451
is that there's a
separation of time scales.

00:42:22.451 --> 00:42:22.950
Right?

00:42:22.950 --> 00:42:25.390
Which means that the rate at
which these neutral mutants

00:42:25.390 --> 00:42:28.860
appear in the population
is very small compared

00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:35.950
to the 1 over the time that
it takes for the fixation

00:42:35.950 --> 00:42:39.230
to occur.

00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:41.650
So what we want is what's
the rate of appearance

00:42:41.650 --> 00:42:46.727
here in units of real time.

00:42:46.727 --> 00:42:48.810
What are the things that
are going to appear here?

00:42:52.865 --> 00:42:53.990
AUDIENCE: Rate of mutation.

00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:55.650
PROFESSOR: All right,
rate of mutation,

00:42:55.650 --> 00:43:01.840
mu, times population size.

00:43:04.470 --> 00:43:06.720
And that's just because
a larger population

00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:10.570
will experience a larger rate
of these mutants appearing

00:43:10.570 --> 00:43:11.320
in the population.

00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:13.969
And it's a linear.

00:43:13.969 --> 00:43:15.760
And that's actually
just-- that is, indeed,

00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:18.220
the rate of appearance.

00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:20.100
And the probability of
fixation of each one?

00:43:23.049 --> 00:43:24.424
AUDIENCE:
[? Excuse me, ?] but it

00:43:24.424 --> 00:43:28.590
doesn't have the unit of rate.

00:43:28.590 --> 00:43:30.320
PROFESSOR: Oh, yes.

00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:33.000
OK, so this is-- OK so
we have to actually--

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.210
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] times
is that per iteration?

00:43:35.210 --> 00:43:35.835
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:43:35.835 --> 00:43:41.900
So this is per, this is per-- so
this is a rate per generation.

00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:48.450
So I guess I'd define
mu as the probability--

00:43:48.450 --> 00:43:52.000
so this is all in units of
per generation, basically.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:53.590
Because mu is a per.

00:43:58.063 --> 00:44:00.550
AUDIENCE: Generation
or iteration?

00:44:00.550 --> 00:44:03.660
PROFESSOR: OK, let's
make sure that I--

00:44:03.660 --> 00:44:08.700
mu-- this is a generation.

00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:15.170
Because if we have-- right.

00:44:15.170 --> 00:44:17.870
So let's say that, for example,
there's 10 to the 6 individuals

00:44:17.870 --> 00:44:21.418
here, and the mutation
rate is-- yeah.

00:44:24.100 --> 00:44:26.273
All right, probability
of fixation was what?

00:44:26.273 --> 00:44:27.220
AUDIENCE: 1 over N.

00:44:27.220 --> 00:44:34.350
PROFESSOR: 1 over
N. So this is great.

00:44:34.350 --> 00:44:38.920
Because this is saying that
the rate at which you expect

00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:42.080
neutral mutants to actually
appear in the population,

00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:44.140
in terms of like,
in terms of fixing,

00:44:44.140 --> 00:44:47.070
if you were to sequence
along a lineage,

00:44:47.070 --> 00:44:50.280
that it is independent
of the population size.

00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:55.890
And it's given by
the rate of mutation.

00:44:59.110 --> 00:45:00.990
But what you expect
is it's on-- it should

00:45:00.990 --> 00:45:02.555
be on a per generation basis.

00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:13.280
So this thing is perhaps useful
in several different ways.

00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:17.390
And there are some subtleties,
like always, to this.

00:45:17.390 --> 00:45:21.226
If you go out and you
measure the rates of fixation

00:45:21.226 --> 00:45:22.600
of neutral mutants,
what you find

00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:25.850
is that it's not really constant
on a per generation basis.

00:45:25.850 --> 00:45:30.400
But more on a-- maybe even
closer on a per actual year

00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:32.200
basis, say.

00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:34.280
In particular,
this would predict

00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:39.300
that if organisms have
the same mutation rate,

00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:42.580
I'd say roughly maybe
humans and mice.

00:45:42.580 --> 00:45:44.910
But yet humans and mice have
very different generation

00:45:44.910 --> 00:45:45.410
times.

00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:51.280
By [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:53.580
Then you would expect
the rate of accumulation

00:45:53.580 --> 00:45:56.540
of neutral mutants in the human
population on a per year basis

00:45:56.540 --> 00:45:59.090
to be much lower than mice.

00:45:59.090 --> 00:46:01.290
But that's not true.

00:46:01.290 --> 00:46:03.780
We'll get into a bit
later why that might be.

00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:07.160
But I just want to highlight
that that's-- that this model

00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:08.930
is very simple.

00:46:08.930 --> 00:46:12.330
And it predicts something
that is too simple, maybe.

00:46:12.330 --> 00:46:14.814
But at least it's
saying that there's

00:46:14.814 --> 00:46:16.730
some sense in which the
population size is not

00:46:16.730 --> 00:46:19.630
as relevant as you might have
thought it was going to be.

00:46:19.630 --> 00:46:21.624
And at least within
a particular lineage,

00:46:21.624 --> 00:46:23.290
if you're talking
about the accumulation

00:46:23.290 --> 00:46:24.920
of neutral mutations
along humans,

00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:29.280
for example, then you can say,
maybe that's roughly constant.

00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:31.372
It gets very-- it
gets very tricky.

00:46:31.372 --> 00:46:33.330
I mean, if you look at
the rate of accumulation

00:46:33.330 --> 00:46:35.680
of neutral mutants in
one protein in humans,

00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:38.650
it's at a different rate than
another protein in humans.

00:46:38.650 --> 00:46:39.860
So everything is complicated.

00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:42.230
But at least each-- along
each of these proteins,

00:46:42.230 --> 00:46:44.880
maybe it still is roughly
some sort of clock,

00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:49.620
because it accumulates
mutations at some rate that's

00:46:49.620 --> 00:46:51.445
roughly linear with time.

00:46:51.445 --> 00:46:53.820
Of course, it's hard to imagine
how any process like this

00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:56.920
can not go with time like that.

00:46:56.920 --> 00:46:59.470
But at least this is
potentially a useful thing.

00:46:59.470 --> 00:47:02.220
And indeed, when you
read about studies

00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:04.730
from sequences
trying to estimate

00:47:04.730 --> 00:47:07.860
the time since the
last common ancestor,

00:47:07.860 --> 00:47:10.200
this is the category
of technique

00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:14.720
that is the basis for that, is
that you're just counting up

00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:16.920
how many neutral mutations
appeared along these

00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:18.211
along these different lineages.

00:47:21.340 --> 00:47:24.660
And I think that there are a
number of really fascinating

00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:26.520
things that you
can try to address

00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:30.280
with this kind of
molecular clock.

00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:32.440
And I'll maybe bring
up one of them.

00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:36.570
Incidentally, I'm not a huge
fan of memorizing things.

00:47:36.570 --> 00:47:41.130
But for both size
scales, and time scales,

00:47:41.130 --> 00:47:44.410
and so forth, I really very much
do like the idea of everybody

00:47:44.410 --> 00:47:47.920
having memorized
a few sign posts.

00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:50.056
Because that way, when
you hear something new,

00:47:50.056 --> 00:47:51.430
you have some way
of interpreting

00:47:51.430 --> 00:47:54.440
whether it's big, or
small, or something else.

00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:59.770
So for example, the time
since the last common ancestor

00:47:59.770 --> 00:48:02.460
between humans and chimpanzees.

00:48:02.460 --> 00:48:05.790
Does anybody have
any sense of-- well,

00:48:05.790 --> 00:48:08.150
I'll actually have us vote,
because I think it's useful.

00:48:08.150 --> 00:48:11.790
In case you're off by
many orders of magnitude,

00:48:11.790 --> 00:48:14.930
that you make-- OK.

00:48:14.930 --> 00:48:20.672
So the last common
ancestor, human, chimpanzee.

00:48:20.672 --> 00:48:22.130
And incidentally,
this is something

00:48:22.130 --> 00:48:24.140
that people do
argue a lot about.

00:48:24.140 --> 00:48:27.860
But it's within a factor
of two of something.

00:48:27.860 --> 00:48:32.350
So I'm going to go ahead
and make some-- so hold on.

00:48:32.350 --> 00:48:52.970
I just want to make sure I get
my-- well, 7 times 10 to the 6.

00:48:59.615 --> 00:49:00.115
All right.

00:49:06.580 --> 00:49:08.570
All right, I'll
give you 10 seconds

00:49:08.570 --> 00:49:10.420
to orient yourself
relative to other things

00:49:10.420 --> 00:49:11.920
that you might know
about the world.

00:49:16.550 --> 00:49:22.900
OK, ready, three, two, one.

00:49:22.900 --> 00:49:29.670
All right, we got--
that's interesting.

00:49:29.670 --> 00:49:30.220
OK, yes.

00:49:30.220 --> 00:49:34.870
I would say it's kind of
uniformly distributed-- oh.

00:49:34.870 --> 00:49:36.080
It's pretty unified.

00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:38.770
There are a minority
of-- not very many E's.

00:49:38.770 --> 00:49:44.090
But I would say that the other
things are pretty-- it's maybe

00:49:44.090 --> 00:49:45.100
peaked around here.

00:49:48.600 --> 00:49:51.150
I don't want to get into
any biblical debates here.

00:49:56.770 --> 00:49:58.200
But right, OK.

00:49:58.200 --> 00:50:00.480
So what are some
things that if we

00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:02.590
have a timeline of the world.

00:50:02.590 --> 00:50:08.400
OK, this is going to be a
flash course in-- all right.

00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:13.870
OK, here's, here I am,
and I'm unhappy because we

00:50:13.870 --> 00:50:16.910
don't know when humans
and chimps-- all right.

00:50:16.910 --> 00:50:18.370
So this is us.

00:50:18.370 --> 00:50:20.122
All right.

00:50:20.122 --> 00:50:21.580
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:50:21.580 --> 00:50:22.290
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:50:22.290 --> 00:50:22.790
OK.

00:50:22.790 --> 00:50:24.463
So let's say-- we
could start with-- you

00:50:24.463 --> 00:50:25.504
want to start with earth?

00:50:25.504 --> 00:50:26.130
OK.

00:50:26.130 --> 00:50:28.970
Four and a half billion.

00:50:28.970 --> 00:50:32.010
This might be on a
logarithmic scale, somehow.

00:50:32.010 --> 00:50:34.936
So we're going to-- just to
space things out a little bit.

00:50:34.936 --> 00:50:35.810
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:50:35.810 --> 00:50:37.851
PROFESSOR: Right, you
know, the universe is what,

00:50:37.851 --> 00:50:38.940
13 ish billion years?

00:50:38.940 --> 00:50:40.590
I don't know.

00:50:40.590 --> 00:50:43.790
People are calculating
with these-- 13 billion,

00:50:43.790 --> 00:50:47.590
four and a half billion,
you know earth congeals,

00:50:47.590 --> 00:50:50.360
it's hot, whatever.

00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:53.765
All right, so life gets started,
maybe, a billion years later.

00:50:56.467 --> 00:50:57.660
AUDIENCE: 3.9 [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:57.660 --> 00:51:00.130
PROFESSOR: 3.9 sounds
like a fine number.

00:51:00.130 --> 00:51:02.350
Wait, what did you vote
for human and chimpanzee?

00:51:02.350 --> 00:51:04.870
You're very specific
on this one.

00:51:04.870 --> 00:51:07.509
AUDIENCE: I actually voted
for 3.5 times [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:07.509 --> 00:51:08.550
PROFESSOR: OK, all right.

00:51:08.550 --> 00:51:11.360
So you're-- you want to get
involved in this actual debate.

00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:13.300
OK, that's why.

00:51:13.300 --> 00:51:16.260
I just want to--
yeah, now I'm going

00:51:16.260 --> 00:51:18.950
to be stuck doing the linear
and logarithmic scaling of how

00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:23.730
I want to-- this is
going to some sort

00:51:23.730 --> 00:51:27.350
of funny logarithmic
scaling from here to here.

00:51:27.350 --> 00:51:35.830
So dinosaurs-- all right,
60 some million years ago.

00:51:35.830 --> 00:51:40.845
Right, so, say bye
to the dinosaurs.

00:51:40.845 --> 00:51:41.345
Dinosaurs.

00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:47.296
[INAUDIBLE]

00:51:47.296 --> 00:51:49.766
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:49.766 --> 00:51:53.030
PROFESSOR: [INAUDIBLE]
explosion was before that.

00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:59.010
Yeah, I don't-- OK,
it's-- OK, all right.

00:51:59.010 --> 00:52:02.250
All right, so this is
around human chimp.

00:52:02.250 --> 00:52:07.160
And indeed, people argue
about whether it's five or 10.

00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:09.830
But you know, given
that we were uniformly

00:52:09.830 --> 00:52:12.980
distributed across
this number, we

00:52:12.980 --> 00:52:16.280
shouldn't be nit picky
about the left one.

00:52:19.020 --> 00:52:20.550
Right, OK.

00:52:20.550 --> 00:52:25.730
And agriculture was
maybe 12,000 years ago.

00:52:25.730 --> 00:52:27.754
Some sense of things.

00:52:27.754 --> 00:52:30.239
AUDIENCE: B is good for
human and Neanderthal,

00:52:30.239 --> 00:52:31.730
and homo erectus.

00:52:31.730 --> 00:52:33.830
PROFESSOR: Yeah, human
and Neanderthals, right.

00:52:33.830 --> 00:52:38.590
That's-- 70, OK, let's say yeah.

00:52:38.590 --> 00:52:39.542
This is when-- right.

00:52:39.542 --> 00:52:41.750
AUDIENCE: Common ancestor
was definitely [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:41.750 --> 00:52:43.500
PROFESSOR: Oh, common
ancestor was before.

00:52:43.500 --> 00:52:45.810
But in terms of interbreeding,
was sort-- all right.

00:52:45.810 --> 00:52:48.650
So this was the interbreeding,
if you want to read that paper.

00:52:53.450 --> 00:52:55.000
But human chimp is here.

00:52:57.592 --> 00:52:58.930
Around seven million years.

00:52:58.930 --> 00:53:01.417
And it's not that this is
the number that's magical,

00:53:01.417 --> 00:53:02.500
that you have to memorize.

00:53:02.500 --> 00:53:06.870
But I think that you
should have some event

00:53:06.870 --> 00:53:10.820
in the history of the world
at each logarithmic spacing.

00:53:10.820 --> 00:53:14.570
Just so that you-- when you hear
about when something happened

00:53:14.570 --> 00:53:16.590
you know kind of
vaguely where to put--

00:53:16.590 --> 00:53:19.364
where to put something.

00:53:19.364 --> 00:53:21.030
Otherwise it just
doesn't mean anything.

00:53:24.210 --> 00:53:27.270
One of my favorite examples
of how the molecular clock was

00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:30.090
used to come up with
something that I think

00:53:30.090 --> 00:53:32.136
is pretty neat
and nontrivial, is

00:53:32.136 --> 00:53:34.010
to try to answer this
question of when humans

00:53:34.010 --> 00:53:36.070
started wearing clothing.

00:53:36.070 --> 00:53:40.050
So this is, a priori,
not very obvious.

00:53:40.050 --> 00:53:40.550
Right?

00:53:40.550 --> 00:53:44.800
Because we know we have
evidence for clothing

00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:47.070
maybe 30,000 years ago.

00:53:47.070 --> 00:53:51.250
And there are needles that
were used for clothing.

00:53:51.250 --> 00:53:56.120
There were-- and some of these
little figurines, at least

00:53:56.120 --> 00:54:00.315
some fraction of the figurines,
like fertility goddess

00:54:00.315 --> 00:54:02.940
kind of thing, some fraction of
them have some clothing, right?

00:54:02.940 --> 00:54:05.825
So then it suggests
that there were clothes.

00:54:05.825 --> 00:54:08.450
But the question is, before that
it's actually rather difficult

00:54:08.450 --> 00:54:11.950
to know when we started
wearing clothes, right?

00:54:11.950 --> 00:54:17.700
Apparently, we lost
our body hair something

00:54:17.700 --> 00:54:19.030
like a million years ago.

00:54:19.030 --> 00:54:20.780
So you might say, oh,
maybe that's around

00:54:20.780 --> 00:54:22.840
when we started wearing clothes.

00:54:22.840 --> 00:54:26.510
Of course a lot of animal hide
and so forth wouldn't last.

00:54:26.510 --> 00:54:28.440
So there's not any
archaeological evidence

00:54:28.440 --> 00:54:31.010
of this.

00:54:31.010 --> 00:54:35.927
And so is anybody aware
of how researchers

00:54:35.927 --> 00:54:37.760
have used the molecular
clock ideas in order

00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:39.335
to try to answer this question?

00:54:57.452 --> 00:54:58.436
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:55:03.848 --> 00:55:07.880
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
this is amazing.

00:55:07.880 --> 00:55:10.455
So you use lice.

00:55:10.455 --> 00:55:13.050
There have been a number
of studies doing this,

00:55:13.050 --> 00:55:17.170
and apparently, there was
a researcher in Germany,

00:55:17.170 --> 00:55:20.980
who was at the Max Planck
Institute for genomics

00:55:20.980 --> 00:55:26.860
or something, and his son
came home with a note saying--

00:55:26.860 --> 00:55:28.790
and actually this
happened to me recently,

00:55:28.790 --> 00:55:31.757
they got an email that
there's a lice outbreak

00:55:31.757 --> 00:55:33.340
to stay out of
preschool, so watch out

00:55:33.340 --> 00:55:36.560
when you're going
by the play area--

00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:40.470
so he got this note back from
his son's preschool that said,

00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:42.030
oh yeah, there's
a lice outbreak,

00:55:42.030 --> 00:55:43.780
so this is what you
have to watch out for.

00:55:43.780 --> 00:55:47.120
But it said, oh, there's a
different species of lice

00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:52.260
that inhabits our
clothing as our hair.

00:55:52.260 --> 00:55:54.980
All right, so I'd say this
is one of those things

00:55:54.980 --> 00:55:57.420
that you could just read that
and say, oh, well whatever.

00:55:57.420 --> 00:55:59.076
Or if you're a
geneticist you read that

00:55:59.076 --> 00:56:03.462
and say, oh, I can use this to
figure out when humans started

00:56:03.462 --> 00:56:04.420
wearing clothes, right?

00:56:04.420 --> 00:56:08.170
Because presumably
the species that

00:56:08.170 --> 00:56:13.960
specializes in living in our
clothing was probably not there

00:56:13.960 --> 00:56:17.717
or had not yet speciated
before we had clothes.

00:56:17.717 --> 00:56:19.800
Course, you can imagine
ways that this could fail,

00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:23.494
but it's a neat hypothesis.

00:56:23.494 --> 00:56:25.160
So then you can go
and you can basically

00:56:25.160 --> 00:56:29.940
sequence the species of lice
that lives in our clothing as

00:56:29.940 --> 00:56:31.990
compared to the kind
that lives in our hair,

00:56:31.990 --> 00:56:35.260
and you can ask, how many
neutral mutations accumulated

00:56:35.260 --> 00:56:37.820
along these different lineages.

00:56:37.820 --> 00:56:40.950
Now, you can imagine that
based on, since we just

00:56:40.950 --> 00:56:43.490
did this very nice
study, we know

00:56:43.490 --> 00:56:47.590
that it should be
more than 30,000 years

00:56:47.590 --> 00:56:53.530
and it should be less than 7
million, probably, hopefully.

00:56:53.530 --> 00:56:56.130
Although, it's always possible
that our ancestral state was

00:56:56.130 --> 00:56:57.796
wearing clothes and
that the chimpanzees

00:56:57.796 --> 00:57:00.200
stopped wearing clothes.

00:57:00.200 --> 00:57:02.790
But we'd be surprised
if that were the case.

00:57:06.100 --> 00:57:07.940
All right, so this is
basically just asking

00:57:07.940 --> 00:57:16.370
about head lice
versus clothing lice.

00:57:16.370 --> 00:57:19.760
And the original study by
this researcher Max Planck

00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:22.950
estimated 70,000 years, but then
just a couple years ago there

00:57:22.950 --> 00:57:25.570
was another publication
from a professor

00:57:25.570 --> 00:57:28.720
at the University of Florida
that estimated 170,000.

00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:31.810
So there still is
a fair range, but I

00:57:31.810 --> 00:57:42.867
guess the most recent estimate
we'd have to say is 170,000.

00:57:42.867 --> 00:57:43.450
Which is neat.

00:57:43.450 --> 00:57:46.760
I don't know-- it's
not that it changes,

00:57:46.760 --> 00:57:50.330
necessarily, how I go
about my daily life,

00:57:50.330 --> 00:57:55.550
but I really love this idea
that it's a very basic question

00:57:55.550 --> 00:58:00.280
that your toddler son might
ask you-- something that you'd

00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:04.730
think that might be totally
unknowable in the sense

00:58:04.730 --> 00:58:07.960
that we would never have any
way of getting any estimate all,

00:58:07.960 --> 00:58:08.460
right?

00:58:08.460 --> 00:58:16.720
But using some clever
theoretical ideas together

00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:23.110
with data on this accumulation
of neutral mutations

00:58:23.110 --> 00:58:26.860
allows one to at least make a
ballpark estimate of something

00:58:26.860 --> 00:58:29.540
that there's no physical
record of except

00:58:29.540 --> 00:58:32.435
in the DNA of our louses.

00:58:32.435 --> 00:58:33.940
Is that a word?

00:58:33.940 --> 00:58:35.080
AUDIENCE: It's lice.

00:58:35.080 --> 00:58:35.300
PROFESSOR: It's just lice?

00:58:35.300 --> 00:58:35.800
All right.

00:58:39.030 --> 00:58:41.650
Are there any questions
about this point?

00:58:47.700 --> 00:58:51.160
So this is all neutral
mutation, but of course we'd

00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:54.450
like to move beyond
these neutral mutations

00:58:54.450 --> 00:58:59.002
to try to understand how
non-neutral mutations spread.

00:58:59.002 --> 00:59:00.460
I'm not going to
do the derivation,

00:59:00.460 --> 00:59:02.990
because the derivation
is in your book,

00:59:02.990 --> 00:59:04.360
and you just read about it.

00:59:04.360 --> 00:59:06.850
But I do want to just make
sure that we understand what

00:59:06.850 --> 00:59:10.470
this equation is telling us.

00:59:10.470 --> 00:59:14.990
So first of all we're
going to assume that A

00:59:14.990 --> 00:59:17.930
has some relative fitness r.

00:59:17.930 --> 00:59:21.250
So r is defined as basically
the relative fitness of of A,

00:59:21.250 --> 00:59:24.450
or the fitness of A divided
by the fitness of B.

00:59:24.450 --> 00:59:27.460
So r is greater than 1 means
that A is advantageous.

00:59:27.460 --> 00:59:31.990
Less than 1 means
it's deleterious.

00:59:31.990 --> 00:59:38.130
And what we're
told is that x sub

00:59:38.130 --> 00:59:47.820
i, which is the
probability that A fixes,

00:59:47.820 --> 00:59:49.685
is equal to this expression.

00:59:58.980 --> 01:00:06.310
If A fixes, given
i A individuals

01:00:06.310 --> 01:00:08.870
and N minus i B individuals.

01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:11.153
AUDIENCE: So I guess that
this assumes that they die

01:00:11.153 --> 01:00:12.850
at the same rate [INAUDIBLE].

01:00:12.850 --> 01:00:13.850
PROFESSOR: That's right.

01:00:13.850 --> 01:00:14.391
That's right.

01:00:14.391 --> 01:00:17.410
The assumption is that we're
placement is unbiased, purely

01:00:17.410 --> 01:00:24.650
random, and it's only birth that
is different by a factor of r.

01:00:24.650 --> 01:00:28.710
And so I think that this
is, on one level, wonderful.

01:00:28.710 --> 01:00:32.410
It's kind of a simple
expression describing

01:00:32.410 --> 01:00:35.010
a lot of information
of the dynamics

01:00:35.010 --> 01:00:36.180
of the stochastic process.

01:00:38.552 --> 01:00:40.760
On another level, the problem
is that you look at it,

01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:44.560
and I think it's easy to have
like absolutely zero intuition

01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:47.090
for what this thing does.

01:00:47.090 --> 01:00:52.110
So what I always like to do when
a student comes to my office

01:00:52.110 --> 01:00:55.740
and says, oh I derived
something great for our project.

01:00:55.740 --> 01:00:58.860
You take a few
limits to get a sense

01:00:58.860 --> 01:01:00.550
of what's going on with it.

01:01:00.550 --> 01:01:02.360
At half-time you find
that it's not true.

01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:05.650
But at least it's a way
of developing intuition

01:01:05.650 --> 01:01:07.210
for what's happening.

01:01:07.210 --> 01:01:10.970
All right, so what are limits
that this thing should behave--

01:01:13.946 --> 01:01:19.450
AUDIENCE: It should
be 0 if there's no A.

01:01:19.450 --> 01:01:25.510
PROFESSOR: Right, so x of
0 should be equal to 0,

01:01:25.510 --> 01:01:27.260
is what you're saying.

01:01:27.260 --> 01:01:28.970
If you have 0
individuals, you should

01:01:28.970 --> 01:01:31.911
have 0 probability of fixing,
independent of your fitness,

01:01:31.911 --> 01:01:32.410
right?

01:01:35.780 --> 01:01:39.240
All right, that sounds like
a reasonable thing to check.

01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:42.160
And does it work?

01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:44.590
So r to the 0 is equal to 1.

01:01:44.590 --> 01:01:47.750
So that's 1, so
it's 1 minus 1-- 0.

01:01:47.750 --> 01:01:50.565
Yep.

01:01:50.565 --> 01:01:51.555
Yes?

01:01:51.555 --> 01:01:54.030
AUDIENCE: r goes to
infinity independently

01:01:54.030 --> 01:01:58.561
of what you start with in step
zero, then you expect A to fix?

01:01:58.561 --> 01:01:59.560
PROFESSOR: That's right.

01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:06.090
So the limit of xi for
any i other than 0--

01:02:06.090 --> 01:02:10.580
as r goes to infinity,
this should be equal to 1.

01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:18.400
All right, so let's see.

01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:29.526
If r goes to infinity, you get
0-- this is also 0-- 1 divided

01:02:29.526 --> 01:02:31.320
by 1 is equal to 1-- all right.

01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:35.370
Did everybody agree with that?

01:02:39.410 --> 01:02:44.109
And that makes sense just that
if A is just super, super fit,

01:02:44.109 --> 01:02:44.900
then it should fix.

01:02:47.590 --> 01:02:49.010
And of course,
what's tricky here

01:02:49.010 --> 01:02:53.380
is that r has to be surprisingly
large before this thing ends up

01:02:53.380 --> 01:02:56.170
being true.

01:02:56.170 --> 01:03:00.370
This limit is great, and
it's correct and true,

01:03:00.370 --> 01:03:01.870
but it's also a
little bit dangerous

01:03:01.870 --> 01:03:06.810
because-- well we'll see
that even things that you

01:03:06.810 --> 01:03:10.390
think of as being very
beneficial mutations typically

01:03:10.390 --> 01:03:11.310
do not fix.

01:03:11.310 --> 01:03:17.690
So this is the danger, but at
least the limit is still true.

01:03:17.690 --> 01:03:20.560
Any other limits that we
think ought to happen?

01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:23.537
AUDIENCE: If an i goes to N?

01:03:23.537 --> 01:03:24.620
PROFESSOR: An i goes to N?

01:03:24.620 --> 01:03:27.040
OK, right.

01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:28.560
This is the opposite
of this one.

01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:32.266
This is just saying that if
you already have fixed then

01:03:32.266 --> 01:03:32.765
you fixed.

01:03:36.270 --> 01:03:38.425
Indeed, if i is equal
to N-- that works.

01:03:42.970 --> 01:03:47.046
Any other limits that you
believe should be true,

01:03:47.046 --> 01:03:47.920
think should be true?

01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:52.200
AUDIENCE: The one we already
checked for r equals one?

01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:53.591
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:03:53.591 --> 01:03:54.090
Indeed.

01:03:54.090 --> 01:04:00.860
So if it's neutral-- so the
limit as r goes to 1 of xi

01:04:00.860 --> 01:04:03.104
should be equal to what?

01:04:03.104 --> 01:04:04.030
AUDIENCE: i/N.

01:04:04.030 --> 01:04:06.730
PROFESSOR: Should be
equal to i/N. So this one

01:04:06.730 --> 01:04:10.570
is a little bit less
obvious, because if you

01:04:10.570 --> 01:04:20.537
set r equal to 1, does this
mean that it's equal to 0?

01:04:20.537 --> 01:04:21.495
And what's the problem?

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

that statement's not true.

01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:36.068
PROFESSOR: Right.

01:04:36.068 --> 01:04:37.746
This is the L'Hopitals.

01:04:37.746 --> 01:04:39.120
There was another
context already

01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:41.360
were L'Hopitals came up, right?

01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:42.810
Maybe?

01:04:42.810 --> 01:04:45.440
OK, so the problem is that
if you set r equal to 1 here,

01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:46.140
then you get 0.

01:04:46.140 --> 01:04:48.220
So then you think,
oh, the answer is 0.

01:04:48.220 --> 01:04:50.720
But you have to be more careful
than that, because this also

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:53.710
is equal to 0.

01:04:53.710 --> 01:05:03.010
And so L'Hopital's-- L-H-
-- is it above the H?

01:05:07.510 --> 01:05:08.820
AUDIENCE: No, that looks right.

01:05:08.820 --> 01:05:09.360
PROFESSOR: Is it good?

01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:09.943
AUDIENCE: Yes.

01:05:09.943 --> 01:05:11.420
PROFESSOR: All right.

01:05:11.420 --> 01:05:12.960
You're French, right?

01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:14.680
I mean, sort of.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:22.755
He's from Quebec, so I don't
know what that question--

01:05:22.755 --> 01:05:23.630
how it's interpreted.

01:05:26.740 --> 01:05:28.500
So this [INAUDIBLE]
looks all right.

01:05:28.500 --> 01:05:31.450
See, what you just
have to do is then

01:05:31.450 --> 01:05:33.600
you take the
derivative with respect

01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:36.240
to r for both the numerator
and the denominator,

01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:38.940
and then you see what ha--
but you take the limit again.

01:05:38.940 --> 01:05:41.130
And sometimes you have
to apply L'Hopital's rule

01:05:41.130 --> 01:05:42.610
multiple times, right?

01:05:42.610 --> 01:05:47.630
So what we write here is this
is the limit as r goes to 1,

01:05:47.630 --> 01:05:51.810
and we take the derivative of
the numerator respect to r.

01:05:51.810 --> 01:06:00.540
So we get out an i, 1 over
r to the i plus 1, maybe?

01:06:06.470 --> 01:06:14.960
And here we get out an N.

01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:18.940
All right, so we took the
derivatives back to r here.

01:06:18.940 --> 01:06:20.750
But we left it as a
limit because we might

01:06:20.750 --> 01:06:22.170
need to apply it again, right?

01:06:22.170 --> 01:06:23.440
Just because after you
take the derivative

01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:25.731
you're not guaranteed that
it's going to work out fine,

01:06:25.731 --> 01:06:26.800
but in this case it does.

01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:28.850
Because already,
this limit, we're

01:06:28.850 --> 01:06:32.320
allowed to just set equal to
1 because nothing blows up.

01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:38.270
So this is indeed
equal to i/N. N.

01:06:38.270 --> 01:06:41.250
And the important point here
is that it's not necessarily

01:06:41.250 --> 01:06:43.080
approximately equal to 0.

01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:46.690
It could be anywhere
between 0 and 1

01:06:46.690 --> 01:06:49.490
depending what i and N are.

01:06:49.490 --> 01:06:52.150
PROFESSOR: So that means
that this expression here

01:06:52.150 --> 01:06:58.142
captures the dynamics,
actually, for all i, r,

01:06:58.142 --> 01:07:01.630
N within the Moran process.

01:07:01.630 --> 01:07:07.320
This thing is simply
just true in this model.

01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:11.020
There are no approximations yet.

01:07:11.020 --> 01:07:13.205
There is, however,
one approximation

01:07:13.205 --> 01:07:16.300
that is very useful
to make, which

01:07:16.300 --> 01:07:19.170
is the approximation
of what happens

01:07:19.170 --> 01:07:22.130
when r is approximately 1.

01:07:27.949 --> 01:07:29.490
In particular what
we're going to ask

01:07:29.490 --> 01:07:32.450
is, if we define something
called a selection

01:07:32.450 --> 01:07:46.020
coefficient, that is
1 plus s, the idea

01:07:46.020 --> 01:07:49.664
here is that in many
cases-- well for Thursday

01:07:49.664 --> 01:07:51.330
we're going to read
a paper that I think

01:07:51.330 --> 01:07:53.000
this is quite interesting.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:59.080
And where they were
analyzing the appearance

01:07:59.080 --> 01:08:01.180
of these mutations
that would allow

01:08:01.180 --> 01:08:04.790
bacteria to survive in some
environment to do better.

01:08:04.790 --> 01:08:06.310
And typical selection
coefficients

01:08:06.310 --> 01:08:09.990
here are kind of 1% to 3%.

01:08:09.990 --> 01:08:13.980
So the mutations that appear and
that allow one of these cells

01:08:13.980 --> 01:08:15.610
to do better in this
new environment,

01:08:15.610 --> 01:08:20.240
convert an advantage that was
on the order of 1% or 2%, or so.

01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:24.580
Which means that s here
would be like 0.01, 0.02.

01:08:24.580 --> 01:08:28.040
Which means that for basically
all the situations that you

01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:30.529
see in the laboratory and
so forth, what you really

01:08:30.529 --> 01:08:34.390
want to know is what
happens for small s.

01:08:34.390 --> 01:08:36.770
So for s, much less than 1.

01:08:36.770 --> 01:08:38.713
So where r is
approximately equal to 1.

01:08:45.029 --> 01:08:51.750
And in this case, we
can say xi, well--

01:08:51.750 --> 01:08:56.670
and we actually are going to
want to ask about x sub 1.

01:08:56.670 --> 01:08:58.370
So that's a 1 now.

01:09:02.010 --> 01:09:04.010
And the reason for that
is that we want to know,

01:09:04.010 --> 01:09:06.370
are there some rate
that new mutations

01:09:06.370 --> 01:09:07.632
will appear in the population?

01:09:07.632 --> 01:09:10.090
When they appear they'll be
present in a single individual,

01:09:10.090 --> 01:09:13.130
and we want to know what
is the probability that one

01:09:13.130 --> 01:09:17.460
individual-- let's say
has a beneficial mutation,

01:09:17.460 --> 01:09:21.410
well, the probability it'll
fix-- so we want to know

01:09:21.410 --> 01:09:27.500
is for s, much less than
1, but larger than 0.

01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:30.720
So far, it's a beneficial
mutation of modest effect.

01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:33.580
What's the probability
that it will fix?

01:09:33.580 --> 01:09:40.359
Well the idea here
is that r to the N

01:09:40.359 --> 01:09:44.590
is going to be much larger
than 1, because N is often

01:09:44.590 --> 01:09:47.460
a big population.

01:09:47.460 --> 01:09:50.040
Now in that situation,
this is just

01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:53.490
approximately equal to 1 over r.

01:09:58.350 --> 01:10:01.920
And r, we've already decided
it can be expressed as 1

01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:05.390
plus the selection coefficient.

01:10:05.390 --> 01:10:08.490
Now this is something
that you want

01:10:08.490 --> 01:10:14.270
to be able to simplify
in your sleep.

01:10:14.270 --> 01:10:16.630
1 divided by 1 plus
s is approximately

01:10:16.630 --> 01:10:19.560
equal to 1 minus 1 minus s.

01:10:24.790 --> 01:10:27.190
And this is indeed
approximately equal to s.

01:10:30.580 --> 01:10:33.600
This is saying that
in the Moran process,

01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:36.180
if a beneficial mutation
appears in the population

01:10:36.180 --> 01:10:41.230
with selection code coefficient
s, that might be 1% to 3%,

01:10:41.230 --> 01:10:46.040
then it has a 1% to 3%
probability of surviving.

01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:49.180
Because this is the
probability of fixing,

01:10:49.180 --> 01:10:51.627
but in this situation
fixation and survival

01:10:51.627 --> 01:10:53.210
are the same thing,
because we're just

01:10:53.210 --> 01:10:55.730
considering this one mutation.

01:10:55.730 --> 01:10:57.120
So it's the only
thing that we're

01:10:57.120 --> 01:10:59.480
considering is the fate of this
one mutation of the population.

01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:00.870
We're going to assume
for now that you

01:11:00.870 --> 01:11:03.286
can't get new mutations in the
population to compete with.

01:11:03.286 --> 01:11:05.040
And then either you
go extinct, or you

01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:07.610
take over the population.

01:11:07.610 --> 01:11:11.120
And what's surprising
here is that even

01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:16.290
if it's a fact that you think
it was big, like 3%, 4%.

01:11:16.290 --> 01:11:18.380
I would love to get
such a mutation.

01:11:18.380 --> 01:11:22.420
But still, in a population
in the Moran process,

01:11:22.420 --> 01:11:25.350
or really in any
other model like this,

01:11:25.350 --> 01:11:28.900
it will typically go extinct.

01:11:28.900 --> 01:11:31.990
Now, it's worth
saying that depending

01:11:31.990 --> 01:11:35.290
upon the model
that you're using,

01:11:35.290 --> 01:11:40.050
you'll get different
numbers in here.

01:11:40.050 --> 01:11:43.900
In this case, the probability
of fixation or survival

01:11:43.900 --> 01:11:46.000
is 1 times s.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:47.650
But in some other
models and it depends

01:11:47.650 --> 01:11:48.720
on the branching process.

01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:50.460
It could be two times s.

01:11:50.460 --> 01:11:55.185
But it's something of
order unity times s.

01:11:55.185 --> 01:12:03.610
AUDIENCE: And so we say that
if s is equal to 0, then x of 1

01:12:03.610 --> 01:12:05.570
should be--

01:12:05.570 --> 01:12:06.460
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:12:06.460 --> 01:12:08.640
PROFESSOR: Right.

01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:09.140
Exactly.

01:12:09.140 --> 01:12:10.973
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
assume that s is much,

01:12:10.973 --> 01:12:12.819
much greater than 1/N?

01:12:12.819 --> 01:12:13.610
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

01:12:13.610 --> 01:12:19.030
So what we've assumed
is that this is true

01:12:19.030 --> 01:12:25.870
and that I think that's
actually already sufficient.

01:12:25.870 --> 01:12:30.960
And indeed, you can go and
you can do the expansion

01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:35.030
and find what x sub 1 should
be equal to in general here.

01:12:35.030 --> 01:12:41.420
And for small s, but
including the possibility

01:12:41.420 --> 01:12:45.935
that it's very-- I'm sorry-- for
small s but not super small s.

01:12:45.935 --> 01:12:47.685
It's a matter of what
you're comparing to.

01:12:50.540 --> 01:12:55.310
And you end up
getting 1/N plus s/2.

01:12:58.380 --> 01:13:04.780
And this is for s times
N much less than 1.

01:13:09.010 --> 01:13:10.980
And indeed, this
is the definition

01:13:10.980 --> 01:13:13.170
of what we mean
by nearly neutral.

01:13:18.580 --> 01:13:21.530
Because up to now we've been
talking about neutral mutations

01:13:21.530 --> 01:13:24.570
as if they just had to be
exactly, exactly neutral,

01:13:24.570 --> 01:13:29.220
but then really, that probably
doesn't actually literally

01:13:29.220 --> 01:13:29.990
exist.

01:13:29.990 --> 01:13:32.790
But if a mutation appears and
it only changes your fitness

01:13:32.790 --> 01:13:35.790
by one part in 10
to the minus 30,

01:13:35.790 --> 01:13:40.220
then it is equivalent to being
a truly neutral mutation.

01:13:40.220 --> 01:13:43.060
But the way that you
quantify that is this thing.

01:13:43.060 --> 01:13:45.270
s times N. You want
to know whether it's

01:13:45.270 --> 01:13:46.760
larger or smaller than 1.

01:13:51.300 --> 01:14:00.285
So for example if you plot x
sub 1 as a function of s-- 0,

01:14:00.285 --> 01:14:02.590
right?

01:14:02.590 --> 01:14:04.326
It crosses 1 over N here.

01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:14.070
Now, it's going to have
a slope here-- s over 2--

01:14:14.070 --> 01:14:16.220
but then it kind of goes up.

01:14:16.220 --> 01:14:22.075
It eventually hits this--
this is just the s line--

01:14:22.075 --> 01:14:25.410
because if s is
much less than 1,

01:14:25.410 --> 01:14:29.590
yet s times N is
much larger than 1,

01:14:29.590 --> 01:14:31.635
then x1 is approximately
equal to s.

01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:38.925
And then over here, this
goes down exponentially.

01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:46.190
But the statement is that if
s times N is much less than 1,

01:14:46.190 --> 01:14:50.590
then the mutation acts
essentially as if it's neutral.

01:14:50.590 --> 01:14:53.830
So then you can
just work with that,

01:14:53.830 --> 01:14:56.160
whereas, if s times N
is much larger than 1,

01:14:56.160 --> 01:14:58.700
then you end up--
it's not guaranteed

01:14:58.700 --> 01:15:02.200
that it's going to fix, but it's
much larger than a probability

01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:06.120
of 1/N. Whereas down
here, it becomes

01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:10.434
very unlikely to fix once
s times N is larger than 1

01:15:10.434 --> 01:15:11.392
on the deleterial side.

01:15:17.300 --> 01:15:20.320
Are there any questions
about what's going on here?

01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:20.820
Yes.

01:15:20.820 --> 01:15:23.814
AUDIENCE: I'm wondering
about that factor of 1/2.

01:15:23.814 --> 01:15:29.053
[INAUDIBLE] seems like we didn't
get it over here when we had N

01:15:29.053 --> 01:15:30.121
equals--

01:15:30.121 --> 01:15:31.120
PROFESSOR: That's right.

01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:31.855
Yeah, sorry.

01:15:31.855 --> 01:15:33.980
And indeed, when I did this
calculation originally,

01:15:33.980 --> 01:15:36.354
I was very confused, because
I thought it should be that.

01:15:36.354 --> 01:15:38.330
But what you see is
that if you plot this,

01:15:38.330 --> 01:15:42.501
the slope here, which is
the 1/2, is less than slope

01:15:42.501 --> 01:15:43.417
over here, which is 1.

01:15:51.369 --> 01:15:52.363
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:15:57.656 --> 01:15:59.780
PROFESSOR: Well, what's
funny is, I actually spent,

01:15:59.780 --> 01:16:01.400
like, hours, trying
to figure out

01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:03.830
where I had made my mistakes.

01:16:03.830 --> 01:16:06.880
No, but I think that
if you just draw it,

01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:08.635
I think it's all consistent.

01:16:08.635 --> 01:16:09.510
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:16:12.870 --> 01:16:15.660
PROFESSOR: I mean, I'm
plotting the entire curve,

01:16:15.660 --> 01:16:17.656
analytically, perfectly.

01:16:17.656 --> 01:16:19.510
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:16:19.510 --> 01:16:23.520
PROFESSOR: It's just
that what we know,

01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:25.600
is that it behaves
like this around here,

01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:33.409
and like s up here, and
I've just connected them--

01:16:33.409 --> 01:16:35.450
it probably doesn't answer
your question but it--

01:16:39.900 --> 01:16:42.610
So I think we have just
enough time to say something

01:16:42.610 --> 01:16:44.090
about this Muller's
ratchet idea.

01:16:46.660 --> 01:16:50.820
Verbally, can a deleterious
mutation, s less than 0,

01:16:50.820 --> 01:16:52.450
can it fix in a population?

01:16:52.450 --> 01:16:52.950
Yes or no?

01:16:52.950 --> 01:16:55.487
Ready, three, two, one.

01:16:55.487 --> 01:16:56.070
AUDIENCE: Yes.

01:16:56.070 --> 01:16:58.500
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:16:58.500 --> 01:17:00.650
This is greater than 0.

01:17:00.650 --> 01:17:04.070
Now it's, very unlikely to
fix if the negative s times N

01:17:04.070 --> 01:17:06.040
is much larger than 1.

01:17:06.040 --> 01:17:10.040
But for small size
populations, you

01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:13.140
could actually fix relatively
deleterious mutations.

01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:20.090
So the idea is that
for small populations,

01:17:20.090 --> 01:17:23.330
it's easy to accumulate
deleterious mutations.

01:17:23.330 --> 01:17:26.738
And indeed, This is related
to something called a mutation

01:17:26.738 --> 01:17:27.529
accumulation assay.

01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:35.230
So if you take a
population of bacteria

01:17:35.230 --> 01:17:47.500
or other microorganism--
so you grow up

01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:49.780
your bacteria in a test tube.

01:17:49.780 --> 01:17:51.990
And so you have a
bunch of bacteria.

01:17:51.990 --> 01:17:54.490
So now there's selection acting
in here, because the faster

01:17:54.490 --> 01:17:56.040
dividing cells are spreading.

01:17:56.040 --> 01:18:00.790
However, what you do is that
you then plate them as colonies.

01:18:00.790 --> 01:18:03.976
And these colonies each
started as single cells.

01:18:03.976 --> 01:18:05.350
Then what you do
is you just take

01:18:05.350 --> 01:18:10.760
a random cell, a random colony,
that came from a single cell,

01:18:10.760 --> 01:18:14.920
and you grow it up here.

01:18:14.920 --> 01:18:17.572
Or you could just replay
directly if you like.

01:18:17.572 --> 01:18:19.155
And then you just
repeat this process.

01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:27.744
The idea is that you've
picked a random cell

01:18:27.744 --> 01:18:29.910
from this population that
you allowed it to grow up,

01:18:29.910 --> 01:18:32.160
and so you've kind of removed
the effects of selection

01:18:32.160 --> 01:18:34.220
in here.

01:18:34.220 --> 01:18:35.910
So when you pick a
random colony here,

01:18:35.910 --> 01:18:37.706
maybe that colony got
some weird mutation

01:18:37.706 --> 01:18:40.080
that decreased its fitness,
but it wasn't really selected

01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:41.810
against because you
just kind of picked

01:18:41.810 --> 01:18:44.440
one of these colonies randomly.

01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:47.610
So this kind of process
is a way of reducing

01:18:47.610 --> 01:18:50.155
what's known as the effective
population size-- N effective.

01:18:52.730 --> 01:18:56.020
So when populations are
not constant in time,

01:18:56.020 --> 01:18:58.420
but instead oscillate
or fluctuate,

01:18:58.420 --> 01:19:03.040
then in many cases the dynamics
or the strength of this drift,

01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:05.900
or the stochastic stuff,
that could be characterized

01:19:05.900 --> 01:19:06.755
by some ineffective.

01:19:06.755 --> 01:19:09.170
And of course, depending
on which variable

01:19:09.170 --> 01:19:11.171
or which quantity
you're trying to study,

01:19:11.171 --> 01:19:13.170
you might have a slightly
different N effective.

01:19:13.170 --> 01:19:15.930
But the point is that if you
have fluctuating population

01:19:15.930 --> 01:19:21.420
sizes, then the relevant
population size for thinking

01:19:21.420 --> 01:19:23.650
about these sorts
of ideas, is often

01:19:23.650 --> 01:19:25.590
towards the smaller
side of the range

01:19:25.590 --> 01:19:26.840
of the fluctuating population.

01:19:26.840 --> 01:19:31.284
So you're kind of dominated by
how small the bottleneck gets.

01:19:31.284 --> 01:19:33.450
And here, you're kind of
going through a single cell

01:19:33.450 --> 01:19:36.190
bottleneck, so that leads
to a very small N effective,

01:19:36.190 --> 01:19:38.039
and it allows for
the accumulation

01:19:38.039 --> 01:19:39.080
of deleterious mutations.

01:19:44.905 --> 01:19:47.280
Now, we'll say something more
about this Muller's ratchet

01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:50.080
idea, because in the
field of evolution,

01:19:50.080 --> 01:19:53.340
I'd say one of the big
overriding questions

01:19:53.340 --> 01:19:56.590
is trying to understand
the evolutionary advantages

01:19:56.590 --> 01:19:59.030
of sexual reproduction.

01:19:59.030 --> 01:20:02.220
Because of this famous
twofold cost of sex.

01:20:02.220 --> 01:20:04.760
That it seems that
an asexual population

01:20:04.760 --> 01:20:08.830
should be able to grow
twice as fast as a sexually

01:20:08.830 --> 01:20:13.440
reproducing population, because
the males are not giving birth.

01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:15.940
So it's a huge cost associated
with sexual reproduction.

01:20:15.940 --> 01:20:20.020
The question is, why is it that
so many organisms engage in it?

01:20:20.020 --> 01:20:23.800
And one of the explanations
that's been proposed

01:20:23.800 --> 01:20:26.680
is this Muller's
ratchet idea, that it

01:20:26.680 --> 01:20:31.320
may alleviate this accumulation
of deleterious mutations.

01:20:31.320 --> 01:20:34.270
We'll talk more about
how this works out,

01:20:34.270 --> 01:20:36.630
maybe quantitatively,
and the other proposals

01:20:36.630 --> 01:20:39.710
and so forth later, but
you may, over the course

01:20:39.710 --> 01:20:42.350
of your studies, come across
this Muller's ratchet vis-a-vis

01:20:42.350 --> 01:20:43.850
the question of
sexual reproduction.

01:20:43.850 --> 01:20:45.475
So I just wanted you
to know that there

01:20:45.475 --> 01:20:48.200
is this discussion out there,
about how sexual reproduction

01:20:48.200 --> 01:20:51.270
may allow for the separation
of these beneficial and

01:20:51.270 --> 01:20:54.000
deleterious mutations
that would otherwise

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.150
accumulate in the population.
