00:00:20.976 --> 00:00:23.160
PROFESSOR: So today
the basic idea

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.050
is to try to understand
the toggle switch.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.260
How such a thing can be made,
why it represents a memory

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:31.656
module.

00:00:31.656 --> 00:00:33.030
But then we'll
relatively quickly

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.209
get into two themes
that are going

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:37.250
to be useful throughout
the rest of the semester.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.960
First is these
dimensionless equations

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.780
that often pop up in the
analysis of these gene

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.130
circuits.

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.880
And it's absolutely
essential that you understand

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.220
how to get to the
dimensionless equations,

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:58.140
and also what these
parameters end up meaning.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.850
And then we'll, at the end,
talk about stability analysis.

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.010
How is it that you can determine
whether a particular set

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.060
of interacting pieces in
a cell or in an ecosystem

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.600
whatnot-- once you get it in
the form of an equation, how's

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.480
is it you can determine whether
a particular fixed point

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.150
or a particular
location is going

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.696
to be stable to perturbations?

00:01:17.696 --> 00:01:19.070
This is going to
be useful for us

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.540
to determine where
the gene network is

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.850
going to kind of move towards.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.600
Also it'll be useful for us
to determine whether a gene

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.140
network is going to oscillate.

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.710
And later, it'll be relevant
in the context of predator prey

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.280
oscillations, and
a bunch of things.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.450
So can somebody
maybe explain briefly

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:45.850
the idea of the toggle switch?

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:49.720
Yes, please.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.154
AUDIENCE: You have these two
genes that repress expression

00:01:53.154 --> 00:01:54.360
to each other.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.216
So when one of them is
large, the other one

00:01:57.216 --> 00:01:58.494
is not expressed. [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:58.494 --> 00:02:00.320
PROFESSOR: Perfect.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.111
So you'll have two genes that
are going to mutually repress

00:02:03.111 --> 00:02:03.610
each other.

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.190
So in this case, each of them
will be a transcription factor

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.080
of some sort that will
bind to the other promoter

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.910
and repress it.

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.985
So there are various
levels of abstraction

00:02:14.985 --> 00:02:17.030
that we might use to
describe such things.

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.370
So we might, for example,
just say A repressing B,

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.109
B repressing A. Of course
when you write it that way,

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:25.400
it doesn't have to be in the
context of a gene network.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.030
This A's and B's could
just be chemicals,

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.780
they could be species
eating each other.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.130
It could be almost anything.

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.940
Now in this framework,
to get a basic sense

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.560
of why this thing might have
two alternative stable states,

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.360
is that often we like to take
the Boolean approximation.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.560
This thing will not always
work, but it's a useful thing

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.120
to do to just kind of first get
a sense of what might possibly

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.710
be happening.

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:56.420
So we might say, 0 corresponds
to some sort of low.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.630
1 might correspond to high.

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.559
And of course, these
things have to be put it

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:03.100
in quotes, because we haven't
specified what we mean by this.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.840
But it's useful
to just make sure

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.140
that we're all thinking
about the same things.

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.610
And then in the
context of A and B,

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.190
we can just say, well, there's
a number of different states

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.690
it could possibly be in.

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:19.650
And you can ask whether this
assignment of logic values

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.050
keeps everybody happy.

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:30.274
And so you might ask, well, is
0, 0 a mutually happy state?

00:03:30.274 --> 00:03:31.690
And of course then
you have to say

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.630
well, if you're in
the 0 state, you're

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.252
not repressing the
other guy, but maybe 0

00:03:39.252 --> 00:03:40.710
is sort of your
equilibrium anyway.

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:43.330
So what we have to do is we
have to make the assumption

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.670
that when you're not being
repressed, in that case

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.820
the promoter will be
actively making that protein.

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.845
So then you'll go to some
sort of high or 1 state.

00:03:52.845 --> 00:03:55.470
So in that case, you say, if you
start out with both repressed,

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.910
maybe both of them
should start trying

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.430
to increase their levels.

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.610
So this, in some ways,
is not a stable state.

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.730
Similarly here, this is
also not a stable state.

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.460
Because in this
case, they're both

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:09.550
going to be trying to
repress one another.

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:11.133
So then they'll both
start coming down

00:04:11.133 --> 00:04:14.080
and then the situation may
resolve into one of these two.

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:18.019
So this is just where
either A or B is on,

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:19.390
and repressing the other one.

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.010
And so for example, in
context of the repressilator,

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.730
on Thursday, this
is just a useful way

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:28.350
to start imagining how
this A repressing B,

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.790
repressing C repressing
A-- how such a loop can

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:32.780
lead to oscillations.

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.840
This kind of analysis
does not at all

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.334
prove that there are
oscillations in any given

00:04:38.334 --> 00:04:39.500
manifestation of this thing.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:40.874
But it's useful
to just make sure

00:04:40.874 --> 00:04:44.480
that you're roughly getting the
idea of what the system might

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.440
be doing.

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.250
Now in many cases, we'll want to
be a little bit more explicit,

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.740
and draw the gene
network in more detail.

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.946
And there are multiple
manifestations

00:04:55.946 --> 00:04:56.820
of the Thomas Switch.

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.270
There are many of them
that have been made.

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.170
So the important thing
is not too necessarily

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:03.990
keep track of exactly
what the components are,

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:08.440
but in one case for example,
we might have A corresponding

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.140
to something here.

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:16.030
It's coming back and
repressing again.

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:20.720
Expression of this
B. And this might all

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.790
be on one piece of DNA.

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:29.110
Whereas this B here will
come back and repress A.

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.260
Now one thing that is-- and
I just want to mention here,

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:34.970
they also have a GFP.

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.440
And this actually
is a case where

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.480
those two can be expressed
off of a single promoter.

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.460
So this is often
done in bacteria

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.100
where there's a
single promoter--

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:53.380
so RNA polymerase actually will
transcribe both of these genes.

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:57.060
This repressor B, as well
as this fluorescent protein.

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.630
So there are going to be
alternative loading sites

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:01.600
for the ribosome in that case.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.880
And eukaryotes typically
do not do this.

00:06:06.657 --> 00:06:07.156
Yeah?

00:06:07.156 --> 00:06:08.092
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:12.011 --> 00:06:13.010
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:13.280
So--

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.405
AUDIENCE: And it will
transcribe everything until--

00:06:15.405 --> 00:06:16.500
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:21.030
So here comes-- so an
RNA polymerase down here

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:22.210
made this whole thing.

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:24.410
And now you might have two
separate locations where

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:28.840
the ribosome loads and
makes this protein B.

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.257
And then a different
ribosome would make this GFP.

00:06:31.257 --> 00:06:32.590
AUDIENCE: And when does it stop?

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:33.631
It just keeps going down?

00:06:33.631 --> 00:06:34.590
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:36.398
So there's a
termination sequence.

00:06:36.398 --> 00:06:38.314
AUDIENCE: No, no, but
it would B and then GFP,

00:06:38.314 --> 00:06:39.170
and then it would
just keep going?

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:39.880
PROFESSOR: No.

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:43.550
The ribosome is told to
basically start here and end

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:44.150
here.

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:46.100
So then it just
makes the B protein.

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:48.926
And then another
ribosome binds here.

00:06:48.926 --> 00:06:52.610
AUDIENCE: If you had more
proteins on the same strand

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:53.540
after GFP--

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:54.350
PROFESSOR: And when
you say protein,

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:55.210
you're referring
to the ribosome.

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:56.527
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:06:56.527 --> 00:06:57.837
AUDIENCE: I mean G's right?

00:06:57.837 --> 00:06:58.420
PROFESSOR: Oh!

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:00.294
OK, you're saying if
there were another gene?

00:07:00.294 --> 00:07:02.660
AUDIENCE: No, if you
have more genes coded,

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:04.950
if you're coding for
more proteins after GFP--

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:06.600
if you have more genes on a

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.226
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:07:08.226 --> 00:07:12.816
--it will just keep going
for an arbitrarily long--

00:07:12.816 --> 00:07:14.991
[INAUDIBLE]

00:07:14.991 --> 00:07:16.990
PROFESSOR: Arbitrary is
always a dangerous word.

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:18.595
But they can be more than two.

00:07:18.595 --> 00:07:21.650
And actually at the biophysics
retreat that some of you guys

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:24.320
were at just last two days,
there was a great talk

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:27.140
by Gene-Wei Li, who's going
to be a new incoming biology

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:27.890
faculty member.

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:32.310
And he was talking about
the FO F1 ATP synthase.

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:34.635
So it's the thing
responsible for making ATP.

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:38.710
He analyzes process work.

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:39.950
And there are many sub units.

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:41.570
So there are half a dozen or so.

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:44.190
And so it's a very
long transcript.

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:46.330
And then what he showed
is that actually you

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:48.180
have different
rates of synthesis

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:51.620
of the different genes
on this one transcript.

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:55.590
And in some cases you want
actually more copies of one

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:57.340
of the subunits
than another one.

00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:01.030
And so then actually
if the final protein,

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:03.980
if it needs 12 of these,
only one of these, then

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:05.990
actually you can make 12
times as much of this,

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:08.460
because you just
have more translation

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:09.460
here than you did here.

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:10.640
And then it's great,
because then you

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:12.514
have all the right
ratios, all the components

00:08:12.514 --> 00:08:14.260
to make the protein.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.220
So you can actually have
additional regulation

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:17.510
even at that stage.

00:08:21.262 --> 00:08:23.470
It's possible not everybody
followed that discussion,

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:24.810
and my apologies.

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:27.180
But feel free to just
erase it from your brain

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:31.520
if you're too confused.

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:36.500
But what you need to keep track
of here is the level of GFP

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:41.730
is going to be perhaps
proportional to the level of B.

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:46.160
Because they're being
expressed at the same time.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:50.460
Now in order for this thing
to be a memory module,

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:52.970
you also want to be
able to reset the state.

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:54.759
So if you were in
this state, you'd

00:08:54.759 --> 00:08:57.050
like to be able to somehow
get it to move to this state

00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:58.440
instead.

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:00.190
Does anybody remember
what the inputs

00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:04.030
were in the context of
the sample toggle switch,

00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:07.330
that it was in that review?

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:10.240
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:11.310
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:14.530
OK, so there are multiple
versions of toggle switch.

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:19.120
And indeed in one case this was
just a small molecule, IPTG,

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:25.570
and that's because this was
in that case, the lac I.

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:28.950
And this then represses
the repression.

00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:30.610
So in many contexts
this class, you'll

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:34.890
have to remember that a minus,
minus is equal to a plus.

00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:38.850
And in different toggle
switches you indeed

00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:42.600
have different ways of
inhibiting this repression.

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:44.600
So this could be another
small molecule, ATCN.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:48.970
In the example that
they had in this review,

00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:52.310
it was actually
heat that did this.

00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:54.909
But that's just because this
transcription factor was

00:09:54.909 --> 00:09:56.200
a temperature sensitive mutant.

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:58.450
So above some temperature,
it could no longer repress.

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:06.370
So for example, if
you start out in high

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:10.050
GFP-- so in this case,
where they-- all right.

00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:16.740
If the cells are in
high GFP, and you

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:21.640
want to switch it into
the alternative state,

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:25.660
what stimulus do you
want to apply here?

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:27.169
So I'll give you a guess.

00:10:27.169 --> 00:10:28.710
It's going to be
either heat or IPTG.

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:35.290
I just want to make sure that
we can all read these diagrams.

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:42.990
This is to switch
from the high GFP,

00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:46.210
and we want to go
to the low GFP.

00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:50.815
Give you 15 seconds to just
try to read off this diagram.

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:01.103
Do you need more time?

00:11:01.103 --> 00:11:02.020
No.

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:02.520
Ready.

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:06.730
Three, two, one.

00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:10.170
So we have a majority are
B. So a majority of people

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:15.120
are saying, well, in this
case, you have a lot of GFP.

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:16.620
Means you have a
lot of this protein

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:19.810
B. In this case, the lac I.

00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:24.330
And we don't have very
much of this other protein.

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:26.840
So that means that if we
want to switch the state,

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:31.160
and get a lot of A, we have
to stop this repression.

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:34.440
So we have to add IPTG.

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:37.740
Any questions about what we
mean by the various symbols

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:38.810
up on this board?

00:11:47.445 --> 00:11:55.962
So after we had IPTG, then
indeed the GFP should go down.

00:11:55.962 --> 00:11:57.920
How long is it going to
take for it to go down?

00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:59.505
Does this switch go
down immediately?

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:04.570
After you add the
IPTG, how long do you

00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:07.210
think it's going to take
for this repressor, lac

00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:10.410
I to fall off of that promoter?

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:16.600
Do you think it's going
to be seconds or hours?

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:18.480
It's actually
seconds, and that's

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:22.470
because this IPTG rapidly
can go across the membrane,

00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:25.660
it'll rapidly bind to
the inhibitor lac I,

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:28.730
and then lac I will fall off.

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:31.720
So in this case, lac I is
actually still present,

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:35.600
so it's going to take hours,
actually for lac I to go away.

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:40.670
But it takes seconds for the
lac I to become inactive,

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:42.490
ineffective.

00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:45.640
So this is the separation
of time scales idea.

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:48.070
But how long is it going to
take for the concentration

00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:52.070
of-- well, how long is it going
to take for GFP to go away

00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:52.859
maybe?

00:12:52.859 --> 00:12:54.400
Is that going to be
seconds or hours?

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:55.346
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:55.346 --> 00:12:59.130
PROFESSOR: Yeah, In this
environment the bacterium--

00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:03.300
they might be dividing
every half hour.

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:05.637
That's the characteristic
time-- if these are stable,

00:13:05.637 --> 00:13:07.970
that would be the characteristic
time scale for example,

00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:10.070
for GFP to go down.

00:13:10.070 --> 00:13:13.270
And of course, that's
even after it's inhibited.

00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:15.080
After you stop making GFP.

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:18.374
In this case, once you
had the IPTG, the lac

00:13:18.374 --> 00:13:20.040
I is going to fall
off of this promoter,

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:22.530
and then we have
to first make A.

00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:25.490
And only after we make A
will we start repressing

00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:27.430
expression of the B and GFP.

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:36.660
That's the process that
you expect to take, hours,

00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:40.440
based on the generation times.

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:43.210
But this is a memory
module because after we've

00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:50.340
added the IPTG, now we can, in
principle, take the IPTG away,

00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:51.270
and it'll stay low.

00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:57.750
So in principle,
this IPTG signal

00:13:57.750 --> 00:13:59.700
can be a transient signal.

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:02.000
And the cells will remember
that they encountered IPTG.

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:07.380
That's what makes this a memory.

00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:10.720
This input can be transient.

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:12.250
Transient signal is remembered.

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:25.080
Now a big part of why this
why this paper was important

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:27.970
is because this toggle
switch was constructed out

00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:32.910
of components that previously
in principle, had not even ever

00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:34.410
seen each other before.

00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:39.320
So maybe that lac I and this
promoter had been put together,

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:42.920
but this whole system,
this whole gene network

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:46.490
was composed of
individual components

00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:48.809
that they were synthetic.

00:14:48.809 --> 00:14:50.600
And were put together
because they thought,

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:51.770
oh this should kind of work.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.260
And it's led to, I think
a real flowering of,

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.930
this intersection between
modeling and experiment.

00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:04.830
This thing was built based
on a model that told them

00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:07.720
that maybe if we do
this, these things

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:12.104
they multiplarize in order
to repress and so forth.

00:15:12.104 --> 00:15:14.520
So there was a real sense in
which the modeling-- and then

00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:16.940
we're going to talk more
about the modeling-- on how

00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:21.560
it was essential to get an
idea of how we should construct

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:23.290
this thing, and
to guide our work.

00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:25.780
Because if any of you
do work in the lab,

00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:27.290
you'll know that
things are hard.

00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:30.039
And often components
don't behave

00:15:30.039 --> 00:15:31.830
the way you think they
should and so forth.

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:34.134
Now modeling can't save
you from all that pain,

00:15:34.134 --> 00:15:36.300
but at least it can guide
you in the right direction

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:38.770
so that it limits the number
of things you have to try.

00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:45.160
Are there any questions about
this element, before we switch

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:47.956
over to some of
the dimensionless

00:15:47.956 --> 00:15:49.580
equations that we're
going to be using?

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:58.180
So the reading for
today was composed

00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:01.200
of a review that
these two pieces,

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:03.940
and one of which I think
might be hard for some people,

00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:06.590
and the other one might
be hard for other people.

00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:10.540
For those of you with maybe more
limited experimental experience

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:13.130
in biology, maybe the
review was a challenge

00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:15.380
to try to understand
all of the nomenclature

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:18.764
and the words, whereas
those of you that have not

00:16:18.764 --> 00:16:20.930
played with differential
equations as much recently,

00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:26.040
may have found the reading
on modeling the toggle switch

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:29.090
and stability analysis
to be more challenging.

00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:30.760
We will, in some
cases, do this where

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:34.660
we have two different hopefully
shorter kinds readings.

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:37.280
And hopefully they're
not both hard for you,

00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:39.280
because then you'll spend
a lot of time reading.

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:40.840
But then it will
be good for you.

00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:44.480
So don't run away quite yet.

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:47.250
But from my standpoint,
it's essential

00:16:47.250 --> 00:16:51.020
that you develop intuition
behind these ideas.

00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:54.736
So once you have this equation
that somebody gives you,

00:16:54.736 --> 00:16:56.110
you have to be
able to figure out

00:16:56.110 --> 00:17:00.620
what assumptions have they made,
and what should the behavior be

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:03.290
roughly, before you go
off and you do simulations

00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:05.589
and full mathematical analysis.

00:17:05.589 --> 00:17:07.630
So a lot of what we're
going to do in this class,

00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:09.650
and in particular
during the lectures,

00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:12.234
is to try to work
on that intuition.

00:17:12.234 --> 00:17:13.650
And the first thing
you need to do

00:17:13.650 --> 00:17:16.490
is make sure that you know if
you don't understand something.

00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:18.430
Sometimes things
look really simple,

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:20.240
especially these
dimensionless equations.

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:23.319
Part of what's attractive about
them is that they are simpler.

00:17:23.319 --> 00:17:26.460
But the connection
to experiments

00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:29.350
can be quite challenging.

00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:31.290
And we'll kind of
see some of this.

00:17:31.290 --> 00:17:33.520
So these dimensionless
equations--

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:38.130
dimensionless
equations-- I think

00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:43.600
that they're both good and bad.

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:46.590
The good is that
you can figure out

00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:50.130
what are the essential
features of the model.

00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:54.131
So you can focus your attention
on the essential mathematical

00:17:54.131 --> 00:17:54.630
features.

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:02.780
The disadvantage is
that you might not even

00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:06.300
know which of the parameters
change when you do something

00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:08.630
experimentally.

00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:11.200
So the problem is
that the connection

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:18.130
to the biology or experiments
is obscured in some cases.

00:18:20.567 --> 00:18:21.650
Connection to experiments.

00:18:26.450 --> 00:18:28.470
And as an example of
this, what we want to do

00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:31.759
is look at these equations
for the toggle switch.

00:18:31.759 --> 00:18:33.300
I know that you guys
just did reading

00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:36.830
on how to get to these
final pair of equations.

00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:39.330
It's important to remember that
in the context of the paper,

00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:40.870
they had a model.

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:42.370
Here are the
dimensionless equations

00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:44.010
that describe our system.

00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:46.470
And we use them to
design the toggle switch.

00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:50.110
But just from that,
you don't necessarily

00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:52.880
realize what's been done.

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:54.990
So we want to make
sure we understand it.

00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:58.400
So the equations that we
want to be comfortable with

00:18:58.400 --> 00:18:59.650
are the following.

00:18:59.650 --> 00:19:04.970
So it's u dot du dt.

00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:09.310
Now here they use alpha
as the rate of expression.

00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:11.450
So beware, in the
past, we sometimes

00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:13.620
used alpha as a
rate of degradation.

00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:16.240
So fair warning.

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:27.150
Alpha 1 1 plus that's v beta.
v to the beta minus u v dot

00:19:27.150 --> 00:19:35.080
is equal to-- here is an
alpha 2 divided by 1 plus u

00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:41.630
to the gamma minus v.
Now in many, many cases,

00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:43.980
we're going to
get-- equations that

00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:46.330
look like this are going to
pop up time and time again

00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:48.163
over the rest of this
semester, and you just

00:19:48.163 --> 00:19:52.500
have to be intimately
familiar with them.

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:54.060
So first of all,
can somebody say

00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:57.740
why this might be capturing the
dynamics of a toggle switch?

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:09.380
I can say something.

00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:13.480
Yes, please.

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:17.384
AUDIENCE: There's some more
of each u or [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:22.160
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:26.070
So the more v you have,
the less production you're

00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:30.000
going to have of
u, and vice versa.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.020
Now in many cases,
beta and gamma

00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:34.160
are going to be something
that's larger than 1.

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:36.880
This is capturing some
element of cooperativity

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:39.970
in the repression on each side.

00:20:39.970 --> 00:20:43.150
So this thing is indeed just a u
repressing a v, and vice versa.

00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:50.850
Now these things are
wonderfully simple equations.

00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:54.880
See that there are four
parameters that are completely

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:57.810
specifying the dynamics.

00:20:57.810 --> 00:20:59.640
Now you'll notice that
the world is always

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:02.220
to be more complicated
than the four parameters.

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:05.750
Now there are two ways in which
these complications went away.

00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:09.420
One is that we are
modeling a simple--

00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:11.709
it's a simple model
of a complex system.

00:21:11.709 --> 00:21:13.500
But the other is that
even the simple model

00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:17.950
has been simplified by going
to this dimensionless version.

00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:23.520
So I want to make sure that
you understood the reading

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:26.310
to the point where at
least you understand

00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:30.660
what units of concentrations,
times, and so forth

00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:33.230
are in this model.

00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:39.460
So first I want to ask about the
effective lifetimes of proteins

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:59.410
u and v. Of u verses v. So
we'll maybe call this tau u

00:21:59.410 --> 00:22:03.530
and tau v. And I want
to know which one--

00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:06.260
and how these things are
related to each other.

00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:12.074
Tau u greater than [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:41.573
DK is again, don't know.

00:22:55.560 --> 00:23:00.220
Now of course in principle,
the lifetimes of u and v

00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:01.589
can be anything.

00:23:01.589 --> 00:23:03.880
The question is, once we've
written down that equation,

00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:05.710
have we actually said
anything about that?

00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:07.460
Have we already made
in assumption or not?

00:23:19.895 --> 00:23:23.470
Do you need more time?

00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:31.060
I see a fair number of
quizzical faces, which

00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:33.920
may mean that even with extra
time, the quizzical faces

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:35.061
would not go away.

00:23:35.061 --> 00:23:35.560
Question.

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:36.050
Yes?

00:23:36.050 --> 00:23:37.841
AUDIENCE: Are you asking
about the lifetime

00:23:37.841 --> 00:23:40.181
of individual [INAUDIBLE]?

00:23:40.181 --> 00:23:41.040
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:43.010
All right.

00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:43.510
Yeah.

00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:46.280
So when I say
effective lifetime,

00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:50.330
that's because if
it's a stable protein,

00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:53.250
then the lifetime of
that individual protein

00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:56.800
is maybe infinite, but you get
an effective lifetime because

00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:58.177
of this dilution effect.

00:23:58.177 --> 00:24:00.010
So when I say effective
lifetime in general,

00:24:00.010 --> 00:24:01.510
in this class, what
I'm referring to

00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:06.250
is the sum of two effects of
dilution to the cell growth,

00:24:06.250 --> 00:24:09.888
as well as actual degradation.

00:24:09.888 --> 00:24:11.776
AUDIENCE: And you're
saying [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:14.608 --> 00:24:15.500
PROFESSOR: No.

00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:19.690
No, I'm saying given that the
Collins Lab-- in their paper,

00:24:19.690 --> 00:24:22.010
wrote down those
set of equations.

00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:25.410
I'm asking have they
already specified anything

00:24:25.410 --> 00:24:28.090
about the effective lifetimes
of these two proteins?

00:24:30.815 --> 00:24:33.270
AUDIENCE: So in those
equations, [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:42.907
Your question asks in units
of that dimensionless time?

00:24:42.907 --> 00:24:44.490
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I
mean we can compare

00:24:44.490 --> 00:24:46.170
two times in some
dimensionless-- yeah,

00:24:46.170 --> 00:24:47.669
we're going to also
talk about that.

00:24:47.669 --> 00:24:49.804
Maybe I should have
done that first.

00:24:49.804 --> 00:24:51.470
But this is a nice
question because it's

00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:53.650
highlighting that you
get a pair of equations,

00:24:53.650 --> 00:24:58.110
they look obvious, but then
some of those basic things

00:24:58.110 --> 00:25:01.350
about the system are
some how not quite clear.

00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:03.670
So I'm going talk about in
this units of whatever time

00:25:03.670 --> 00:25:05.600
is being-- however
time-- we're going

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:08.450
to discuss how time is being
measured in a moment as well.

00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:11.930
But however time
is being measured,

00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:15.150
is there some
relationship here or not?

00:25:18.690 --> 00:25:20.400
Let's go ahead and vote.

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:23.530
And it's fine, if
you really do not

00:25:23.530 --> 00:25:28.040
know what I'm talking about,
you can say E and that's fine.

00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:29.440
Let's see where we are.

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:31.670
Ready, three, two, one.

00:25:35.130 --> 00:25:38.460
So I would say that it's
split between B's and D's.

00:25:41.866 --> 00:25:43.490
And that's great,
because that means we

00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:45.490
have something to talk about.

00:25:45.490 --> 00:25:47.914
There's broad agreement
that it's one of these two.

00:25:47.914 --> 00:25:48.830
So turn your neighbor.

00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:50.330
You should be able
to find somebody

00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:51.897
that disagrees with you.

00:25:51.897 --> 00:25:53.980
If you can't find anybody
that disagrees with you,

00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:55.814
you could think
about how parameters

00:25:55.814 --> 00:25:58.230
are going to change as you
vary other experimental things.

00:26:01.526 --> 00:26:04.016
[CLASSROOM CHATTER]

00:27:21.442 --> 00:27:23.400
PROFESSOR: Why don't we
go ahead and reconvene?

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:25.320
I just want to see where we are.

00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:28.120
So let's get our cards ready.

00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:31.930
And we're still working on this
one, so you can ignore this.

00:27:31.930 --> 00:27:32.501
Is it B or D?

00:27:32.501 --> 00:27:33.000
Ready?

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.125
Three, two, one.

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:41.640
So I'd say there's some
migration towards B,

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:43.190
but not 100% still.

00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:46.790
So I'm going to
side with this here.

00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:52.142
Can somebody volunteer
why they're saying that?

00:27:52.142 --> 00:27:59.990
AUDIENCE: Well, if I remember
correctly then they [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:03.328
time by multiplying time
by degradation rate.

00:28:03.328 --> 00:28:05.718
And they do that with
the same degradation

00:28:05.718 --> 00:28:08.522
rate for both [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:08.522 --> 00:28:09.230
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:11.820
So the answer here is yeah-- so
the way that we got to this non

00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:14.236
dimensional time, that we're
going to discuss in a moment,

00:28:14.236 --> 00:28:17.820
is multiplying by-- or divided
by some degradation rate.

00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:19.830
And you remember the derivation.

00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:22.400
You remember that
it was [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:27.310
But in many cases you don't
get to read the derivation

00:28:27.310 --> 00:28:29.530
before you have to answer it.

00:28:29.530 --> 00:28:31.620
In many cases you just
get these equations,

00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:34.500
and you have to figure out
what the authors have assumed.

00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:37.360
So I think your answer
is very much correct,

00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:39.570
but it might be--
I'm glad that you're

00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:43.282
using the pre-class reading,
but at the same time

00:28:43.282 --> 00:28:45.240
we have to be able to
answer this question just

00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:47.150
from these equations.

00:28:47.150 --> 00:28:48.776
Because it is contained there.

00:28:48.776 --> 00:28:49.276
Yeah?

00:28:49.276 --> 00:28:52.657
AUDIENCE: So if you remove
production [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:52.657 --> 00:28:53.460
PROFESSOR: Perfect.

00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:55.001
AUDIENCE: If you
solve that equation,

00:28:55.001 --> 00:28:57.316
it's exponential to E,
and the [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:00.648 --> 00:29:01.820
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:02.430
That's right.

00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:05.050
So the statement
here is that it's

00:29:05.050 --> 00:29:07.300
nice to just imagine that
we shut down production.

00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:09.260
So these first terms go away.

00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:12.330
All right now we just have
u dot is equal to minus u.

00:29:12.330 --> 00:29:16.145
So the concentration of u and
B will both fall exponentially.

00:29:16.145 --> 00:29:18.520
And they're going to fall the
same rate in whatever units

00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:20.490
of time-- and we'll
discuss this in a moment--

00:29:20.490 --> 00:29:23.270
but however time
is being measured,

00:29:23.270 --> 00:29:24.860
they're going to
fall at the same rate

00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:28.310
because it's whatever
appears in front of these two

00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:29.830
that determines that rate.

00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:32.630
So we've already assumed
that the effective lifetime

00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:34.862
of u and v are the
same once we've

00:29:34.862 --> 00:29:36.070
written down these equations.

00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:37.444
Now that doesn't
have to be true.

00:29:37.444 --> 00:29:39.300
That means that if
experimentally, you

00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:41.640
want to make a toggle
switch with two proteins,

00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:43.570
with different st
abilities, then

00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:44.820
you can't use these equations.

00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:47.412
You have to add a delta on
one of the two equations

00:29:47.412 --> 00:29:49.870
to capture that dynamic that
they have different lifetimes.

00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:55.860
So these equations are
simple because we've already

00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:59.010
combine things, but they've
also already assumed some things

00:29:59.010 --> 00:30:01.890
to make it look more
simple and more symmetric.

00:30:01.890 --> 00:30:04.100
So for example,
they're allowing for

00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:07.490
different effective
cooperativities, beta gamma,

00:30:07.490 --> 00:30:09.190
for the two repressors.

00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:11.446
They didn't have to do that
if they didn't want to.

00:30:11.446 --> 00:30:13.070
If they wanted to,
they could have just

00:30:13.070 --> 00:30:16.060
had beta in both equations.

00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:18.200
And that case they
would be assuming

00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:20.620
that the effective
cooperativity of the repression

00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:21.930
is the same for the two.

00:30:21.930 --> 00:30:23.820
So depending on
what you write down,

00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:26.272
you're making different
assumptions about the system.

00:30:26.272 --> 00:30:28.480
And so you have to be able
to look at these equations

00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:30.526
and figure out what
assumptions have been made.

00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:33.920
Yes, question.

00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:35.396
AUDIENCE: I'm having
trouble seeing

00:30:35.396 --> 00:30:37.364
what the first term is doing.

00:30:37.364 --> 00:30:41.300
So the second one
is [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:44.780
PROFESSOR: So broadly, the
first term in these equations

00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:46.620
is the production
rate of the protein.

00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:49.260
And the second term is some
sort of effective degradation,

00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:50.593
but it could be due to dilution.

00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:55.570
The nice thing about just
ignoring the production term

00:30:55.570 --> 00:30:58.250
is that it's a way of focusing
only on the effective lifetime

00:30:58.250 --> 00:30:58.750
portion.

00:31:02.730 --> 00:31:06.820
This effective lifetime
is it's captured here,

00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:09.475
irrespective of whether
there's production or not.

00:31:09.475 --> 00:31:10.850
Of course the
production is going

00:31:10.850 --> 00:31:14.410
to affect what the equilibrium
is that we go to and so forth,

00:31:14.410 --> 00:31:18.759
but remember for example, that
this effective lifetime that's

00:31:18.759 --> 00:31:21.050
set for time scale both to
come up to some equilibrium,

00:31:21.050 --> 00:31:23.070
as well as come down
to some equilibrium.

00:31:23.070 --> 00:31:25.500
That's telling us about
this effective lifetime

00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:30.110
is essential to tell
us about the rate

00:31:30.110 --> 00:31:32.520
that concentration is going
to change within the cell,

00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:35.390
whether you're going up or down.

00:31:35.390 --> 00:31:38.370
Did that answer your
question a little bit?

00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:39.148
Yes?

00:31:39.148 --> 00:31:41.770
AUDIENCE: That
last thing you said

00:31:41.770 --> 00:31:43.710
is not quite true because--

00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:45.350
PROFESSOR: Because
of the toggle.

00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:47.510
I agree.

00:31:47.510 --> 00:31:50.500
What I was really referring to
there was if we get rid of one,

00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:52.450
and we're just talking
about where we just

00:31:52.450 --> 00:31:55.030
manually set the production
rate to one thing or another.

00:31:55.030 --> 00:31:57.780
The actual dynamics of this are
more complicated, certainly.

00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:03.470
So is everybody
happy with this idea

00:32:03.470 --> 00:32:05.678
that just by writing down
those equations, we've made

00:32:05.678 --> 00:32:08.440
some assumptions constraining
relationships between u and v

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:10.430
in some ways, but
not in other ways.

00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:11.652
Yeah?

00:32:11.652 --> 00:32:14.110
So we've kind of already danced
around this other question,

00:32:14.110 --> 00:32:17.730
but I want to make sure
that we address it head on.

00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:22.730
We want to know what
is this unit of time.

00:32:22.730 --> 00:32:25.550
If I say oh, at time T
[INAUDIBLE] 1 versus time

00:32:25.550 --> 00:32:31.080
[INAUDIBLE] to 2-- so if delta
t-- what is 1 in this case?

00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:33.630
Are we referring to one second?

00:32:33.630 --> 00:32:34.660
CGS.

00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:38.680
Or is it one hour
corresponding to another unit?

00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:41.256
Cell generation time, effective
lifetime, or don't know?

00:32:44.904 --> 00:32:48.430
Ten seconds, since we've
already kind of said this,

00:32:48.430 --> 00:32:52.040
but it's important
enough to make sure.

00:33:02.041 --> 00:33:02.540
Ready?

00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:09.100
No?

00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:09.599
Yes?

00:33:12.362 --> 00:33:14.570
I'll give you another ten
seconds, just to make sure.

00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:37.010
Do you need more time?

00:33:37.010 --> 00:33:37.510
Let's vote.

00:33:37.510 --> 00:33:38.070
Ready?

00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:41.797
Three, two, one.

00:33:41.797 --> 00:33:42.296
OK.

00:33:45.850 --> 00:33:47.970
A majority of the group
is agreeing in this case

00:33:47.970 --> 00:33:49.136
it's the effective lifetime.

00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:55.590
And it's not the cell
generation time necessarily

00:33:55.590 --> 00:33:58.720
because if we actually
have a degradation

00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:02.046
tag on this protein, if it's
not a stable protein then

00:34:02.046 --> 00:34:03.920
the effective lifetime
is going to be shorter

00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:06.980
than the cell generation time.

00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:09.780
So we've normalized
time by dividing out

00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:16.320
that-- whatever that delta thing
would have been on the right.

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:22.360
Now this is great because it
makes the equations simple.

00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:25.870
But remember what that
means is that if we change

00:34:25.870 --> 00:34:28.510
the degradation rate,
then all of a sudden

00:34:28.510 --> 00:34:32.122
it's not obvious
what's going to happen.

00:34:32.122 --> 00:34:33.580
Experimentally
we're always allowed

00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:37.060
to affect the degradation rate.

00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:41.620
But the question is, which
parameter or parameters

00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:47.194
change if you add
a degradation tag?

00:34:47.194 --> 00:34:48.860
So if you increase
the degradation rate.

00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:58.332
That's what I want to do.

00:34:58.332 --> 00:34:59.790
We'll do that in
just moment there.

00:34:59.790 --> 00:35:01.623
I have another question
that I wanted to do.

00:35:01.623 --> 00:35:03.647
Do you guys remember
the equations up there?

00:35:03.647 --> 00:35:05.230
Maybe I'll come over
to the other side

00:35:05.230 --> 00:35:08.080
just so that I-- it's useful
to be able to stare at those

00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:10.344
equations as we discuss.

00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:24.070
So the question is,
what is the unit

00:35:24.070 --> 00:35:25.720
of concentration of protein u?

00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:32.620
And of course, these
are dimensionless.

00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:36.820
What I really mean is
what does u equal to 1

00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:37.990
mean in real units?

00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:44.450
I'll just write that.

00:35:44.450 --> 00:35:48.000
What does u equal to 1 mean?

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.130
What does u equal
to 1 correspond to?

00:35:50.130 --> 00:35:53.800
In something that
is recognizable to

00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:55.470
an experimentalist in the lab?

00:36:34.667 --> 00:36:36.000
You guys understand what I mean?

00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:41.190
So if in this model I
say, u is equal to 1,

00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:42.340
or u is equal to 10.

00:36:42.340 --> 00:36:45.360
What do those numbers--
what do they mean?

00:36:54.450 --> 00:36:57.258
So are there any questions
about my question first of all?

00:36:57.258 --> 00:36:57.758
Yes?

00:36:57.758 --> 00:37:01.704
AUDIENCE: Are we [INAUDIBLE]
solely on seeing those

00:37:01.704 --> 00:37:02.204
equations?

00:37:02.204 --> 00:37:06.650
Or based on the
reading of [INAUDIBLE]?

00:37:06.650 --> 00:37:09.890
PROFESSOR: I would say
that the reading actually

00:37:09.890 --> 00:37:11.660
has a somewhat more
complicated model,

00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:13.790
and involves multiple steps.

00:37:13.790 --> 00:37:16.500
So this is really just
looking at those equations,

00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:20.310
given that we can
see that there is

00:37:20.310 --> 00:37:25.370
some statement about how u and
v are repressing each other.

00:37:25.370 --> 00:37:28.710
So we're saying that there is
some function that describes--

00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:31.170
it's a phenomenological
function-- describes the input

00:37:31.170 --> 00:37:33.711
output relationship in terms of
some concentration of u leads

00:37:33.711 --> 00:37:36.540
to some repression
of v and vice versa.

00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:39.464
From that actually, we should
be able to say something

00:37:39.464 --> 00:37:41.630
about what we've already
assumed in these equations.

00:38:05.914 --> 00:38:06.830
Do you need more time?

00:38:06.830 --> 00:38:07.455
Yeah, question.

00:38:07.455 --> 00:38:12.420
AUDIENCE: So the k of u promoter
is-- that's defined as the--

00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:15.870
PROFESSOR: That's the binding of
v to the u promoter-- the piece

00:38:15.870 --> 00:38:18.135
of DNA in front of the u gene.

00:38:24.090 --> 00:38:28.190
Do we need more time, or
shall we give it a go?

00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:28.760
Ready?

00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:33.000
Three, two, one.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:33.500
All right.

00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:37.203
So we got some A, B, C, D's.

00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:41.660
No E's.

00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:44.500
At least it means that your
neighbor has an opinion.

00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:49.790
He or she cannot say that-- Turn
to your neighbor and discuss.

00:38:49.790 --> 00:38:52.778
[CLASSROOM CHATTER]

00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:43.210
Did you guys all decide
you're comfortable?

00:40:43.210 --> 00:40:45.500
Why don't we go
ahead and reconvene.

00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:48.450
It seems like it may be we're
coming to consensus here.

00:40:48.450 --> 00:40:49.320
Ready?

00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:52.790
Three, two, one.

00:40:52.790 --> 00:41:04.830
So now we got a clear majority
agreeing that it should be D.

00:41:04.830 --> 00:41:09.690
So what happened was that over
here in the original equations

00:41:09.690 --> 00:41:14.720
we had a real concentration
of u divided by some k.

00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:18.540
And that was the k for
repressing v. Because v

00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:21.500
is this guy that is over here.

00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:25.540
And what we did is we then
just turned u divided by this k

00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:28.920
for binding this v
promoter into just u.

00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:33.400
So in particular, when
that concentration of u

00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:36.330
is equal to its
associated k, that

00:41:36.330 --> 00:41:38.430
corresponds to half repression.

00:41:38.430 --> 00:41:39.540
Same thing here.

00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:42.736
One way to think about this is
just that when u is equal to 1,

00:41:42.736 --> 00:41:47.760
we're getting half of
maximum possible repression.

00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:51.100
Similarly, that's what
v equal to 1 means.

00:41:51.100 --> 00:41:55.770
U and v, do they have to
have the same-- I mean,

00:41:55.770 --> 00:41:57.670
does u equal to 1
and v equal to 1

00:41:57.670 --> 00:41:59.420
mean the same thing
in terms of the number

00:41:59.420 --> 00:42:01.350
of the proteins in the cell?

00:42:01.350 --> 00:42:01.850
No.

00:42:01.850 --> 00:42:03.850
Not necessarily.

00:42:03.850 --> 00:42:07.170
So we've allowed
for the possibility

00:42:07.170 --> 00:42:11.660
that those things are measured
in different real units.

00:42:11.660 --> 00:42:13.960
But in both cases,
it's telling us

00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:16.740
about how the strength
of repression.

00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:19.840
And u and v equal to 1 tells
us about that crossing point

00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:22.530
where the other promoter
is half repressed.

00:42:25.530 --> 00:42:29.190
Are there any questions
about what happened there?

00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:32.673
This is especially confusing
because it doesn't enter

00:42:32.673 --> 00:42:35.080
into the equations at all.

00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:37.910
Things just went away.

00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:40.110
But you know that this is
the dimensionless versions

00:42:40.110 --> 00:42:42.550
of the equations
because we have u here,

00:42:42.550 --> 00:42:44.420
and we're adding 1 to it.

00:42:44.420 --> 00:42:48.128
Are we allowed to add
things with different units?

00:42:48.128 --> 00:42:50.700
No.

00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:53.420
Never.

00:42:53.420 --> 00:42:56.736
What that means is that--
since they're being added,

00:42:56.736 --> 00:42:58.360
that means that we
already know that we

00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:01.677
made-- this is the dimensionless
version of the equation.

00:43:01.677 --> 00:43:03.260
And it actually then
immediately tells

00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:05.190
us what u equal to 1 means.

00:43:09.630 --> 00:43:11.130
So now what we want
to do is we want

00:43:11.130 --> 00:43:14.940
to make sure that our intuition
on this is tip top shape.

00:43:14.940 --> 00:43:17.130
In particular, we
want to know if I

00:43:17.130 --> 00:43:19.530
want to change the
dynamics of the system--

00:43:19.530 --> 00:43:22.707
so let's say that we go
and we spend lots of time

00:43:22.707 --> 00:43:24.290
calculating the fixed
point stability,

00:43:24.290 --> 00:43:26.540
and we do everything
on these equations.

00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:28.120
And then we know
what we need to do

00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:29.953
is we need to change
some parameter in order

00:43:29.953 --> 00:43:32.020
to get say, a toggle switch.

00:43:32.020 --> 00:43:34.100
We need to know how we do that.

00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:38.820
We need to know how the
parameters in real life,

00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:41.390
or even in the context
of the model, how is it

00:43:41.390 --> 00:43:44.420
that the parameters you can
actually change experimentally,

00:43:44.420 --> 00:43:50.400
how is it that the affect or not
the parameters in this model?

00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:55.680
So the question is, let's say
we increase the degradation

00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:58.267
rate of these two
transcription factors u

00:43:58.267 --> 00:44:01.375
and v, which of the parameters
are going to change?

00:44:08.770 --> 00:44:12.029
So I'll give you 30
seconds to think about what

00:44:12.029 --> 00:44:13.070
should be happening here.

00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:47.180
Do you need more time?

00:44:49.850 --> 00:44:51.372
Let's see where we are.

00:44:51.372 --> 00:44:52.030
Ready?

00:44:52.030 --> 00:44:54.675
Three, two, one.

00:44:54.675 --> 00:44:56.050
And this is the
possibility where

00:44:56.050 --> 00:44:57.270
you can put up two things.

00:44:57.270 --> 00:45:01.320
Remember our
fabulous card system?

00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:03.575
So I think most people are
saying it's going to be A

00:45:03.575 --> 00:45:06.860
and B are going to change.

00:45:06.860 --> 00:45:10.210
So beta and gamma are capturing
how cooperative that transition

00:45:10.210 --> 00:45:10.710
is.

00:45:10.710 --> 00:45:14.180
And the cooperativity
is not affected

00:45:14.180 --> 00:45:20.089
by the questions of the exact
concentration, or time scale

00:45:20.089 --> 00:45:20.630
and so forth.

00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:23.090
Because that has to do
with the molecular nature

00:45:23.090 --> 00:45:26.480
of the interactions
with the promoter.

00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:29.520
So in some ways beta gamma
are the simplest things

00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:32.620
in this system.

00:45:32.620 --> 00:45:37.122
Now the question is, do
alpha 1-- do they go up

00:45:37.122 --> 00:45:38.010
or do they go down?

00:45:38.010 --> 00:45:39.676
Now that I've told
you that they change.

00:45:42.750 --> 00:45:46.075
If degradation rate goes
up, alpha 1 and alpha 2,

00:45:46.075 --> 00:45:47.450
do they go up or
do they go down?

00:45:51.900 --> 00:45:54.060
I'll give you 10 seconds
to think about it.

00:46:03.744 --> 00:46:04.660
Do you need more time?

00:46:10.630 --> 00:46:11.340
Let's see it.

00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:11.840
Ready?

00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:13.215
Three, two, one.

00:46:17.540 --> 00:46:20.380
It's a majority are
saying it's going go down.

00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:22.440
Can somebody offer up
an intuitive explanation

00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:23.356
for why this might be?

00:46:28.460 --> 00:46:28.960
[INAUDIBLE]

00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:31.852
AUDIENCE: The
degradation rate goes up,

00:46:31.852 --> 00:46:34.262
it means the times
scale goes down.

00:46:34.262 --> 00:46:37.154
As you produce a fixed
number of per unit time,

00:46:37.154 --> 00:46:39.256
the unit time gets
smaller and produces less.

00:46:39.256 --> 00:46:41.860
PROFESSOR: Right, so if the
degradation rate goes up,

00:46:41.860 --> 00:46:44.039
that's kind of reducing
this unit of time.

00:46:44.039 --> 00:46:46.080
So you just are not going
to make as much protein

00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:48.610
in that unit of time.

00:46:48.610 --> 00:46:50.290
The way that I like
to think about this

00:46:50.290 --> 00:46:52.370
maybe is that if the
degradation rate goes up,

00:46:52.370 --> 00:46:57.180
then the real concentration
of the protein should go down.

00:46:57.180 --> 00:47:00.260
And that means
that the repression

00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:02.894
should be less effective.

00:47:02.894 --> 00:47:04.310
And then wait, is
this helping me?

00:47:04.310 --> 00:47:13.635
No, now that I'm saying
this-- I don't like

00:47:13.635 --> 00:47:14.760
to think about it that way.

00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:24.179
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:47:24.179 --> 00:47:24.720
That's right.

00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:26.650
Yeah, so-- that's right.

00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:33.135
You should decrease
the sort of-- So

00:47:33.135 --> 00:47:35.480
if the degradation rate
goes up, you decrease

00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:38.160
the real concentration,
which it means indeed

00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:39.570
that you are at steady state.

00:47:39.570 --> 00:47:41.940
Say a less effective repressor.

00:47:41.940 --> 00:47:43.900
That means the
concentration goes down

00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:48.260
in these units of how
repressive are you.

00:47:48.260 --> 00:47:50.910
I think the way of thinking
about it was correct,

00:47:50.910 --> 00:47:54.880
just the words were not.

00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:59.180
You can also then go-- and it's
useful in the context of when

00:47:59.180 --> 00:48:01.600
you actually go and you do
the math of removing all

00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:04.080
these parameters, just to
make sure that-- because it's

00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:07.040
easy to do this thing where
you just divide everything out,

00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:09.120
and you're happy, and
whistling and so forth.

00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:10.870
But at the end of the
day, you really just

00:48:10.870 --> 00:48:13.690
have no sense of what happened.

00:48:13.690 --> 00:48:17.430
Of how the parameters
that come out of the model

00:48:17.430 --> 00:48:21.700
are affected by the real
things that you can change.

00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:23.900
And in some ways what's
funny about these equations

00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:27.550
is that essentially
everything is in the alphas.

00:48:27.550 --> 00:48:30.940
Because beta and gamma, that's
this cooperativity parameter.

00:48:30.940 --> 00:48:32.420
That's what it is.

00:48:32.420 --> 00:48:33.320
That's all it is.

00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:35.745
So that means that everything
else ends up in the alphas.

00:48:39.290 --> 00:48:44.340
So the strength of the
promoter, the concentration

00:48:44.340 --> 00:48:46.880
you need to repress,
the lifetime, everything

00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:48.380
rolls up in these alphas.

00:48:48.380 --> 00:48:51.130
And this is the beauty of
the dimensionless equations.

00:48:51.130 --> 00:48:53.630
Is it's telling you that you
don't have all these different,

00:48:53.630 --> 00:48:55.110
separate knobs.

00:48:55.110 --> 00:48:57.360
You can't change one
and change another,

00:48:57.360 --> 00:48:59.280
and go into some funny regime.

00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:02.010
Because it's all rolled into
one fundamental parameter,

00:49:02.010 --> 00:49:03.250
these alphas.

00:49:03.250 --> 00:49:05.370
That's telling you that
once you understand

00:49:05.370 --> 00:49:08.577
how these equations behave,
then you in principle understand

00:49:08.577 --> 00:49:11.035
everything that could possibly
happen in that simple model.

00:49:11.035 --> 00:49:12.350
But that's what's
wonderful about

00:49:12.350 --> 00:49:13.516
the dimensionless equations.

00:49:13.516 --> 00:49:15.150
But the problem is
that you sometimes

00:49:15.150 --> 00:49:17.610
lose track of how it's related
to the real experimental

00:49:17.610 --> 00:49:18.110
things.

00:49:18.110 --> 00:49:21.770
So I would say that I very
much like these dimensionless

00:49:21.770 --> 00:49:22.360
equations.

00:49:22.360 --> 00:49:24.894
They clarify things for you.

00:49:24.894 --> 00:49:26.685
But you have to spend
the time to make sure

00:49:26.685 --> 00:49:32.080
that you understand where
all of reality went.

00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:36.070
Because it all ends up in
this mathematical equation,

00:49:36.070 --> 00:49:37.680
and that simplifies things.

00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:43.700
You're not floating in a
sea of symbols anymore,

00:49:43.700 --> 00:49:47.220
but it's really easy to
lose track of the connection

00:49:47.220 --> 00:49:49.450
to real measurements.

00:49:49.450 --> 00:49:51.620
And that's why we
want to do modeling

00:49:51.620 --> 00:49:54.090
so we can make that connection.

00:49:54.090 --> 00:49:57.580
So do the dimensionless
equations, but make sure

00:49:57.580 --> 00:50:00.380
that you play with them
a bit so you know what

00:50:00.380 --> 00:50:02.190
changes when you change what.

00:50:02.190 --> 00:50:05.680
And we'll actually see a
bit later, some other cases

00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:10.880
where it's actually quite tricky
to figure out what's happening.

00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:13.890
On exams I always want to
just ask a equation like this,

00:50:13.890 --> 00:50:16.690
if this parameter goes off--
and then the TAs always say,

00:50:16.690 --> 00:50:20.050
it's too hard of an question.

00:50:20.050 --> 00:50:22.760
I feel like it's like the most
basic thing you would want

00:50:22.760 --> 00:50:25.050
from an equation like this.

00:50:25.050 --> 00:50:28.330
Is that if you increase
the strength of this--

00:50:28.330 --> 00:50:31.170
But it actually is-- it's
surprisingly difficult.

00:50:31.170 --> 00:50:33.780
So maybe this year
I'll convince the TAs

00:50:33.780 --> 00:50:37.150
that it's an OK question.

00:50:37.150 --> 00:50:39.830
Are there any questions
about where we are right now?

00:50:44.209 --> 00:50:46.000
So what I want to do
for the last half hour

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:48.125
is talk about
stability analysis.

00:50:50.970 --> 00:50:53.220
The first context in
which stability comes up

00:50:53.220 --> 00:50:56.240
in this class is indeed
in this toggle switch.

00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:59.449
But it's not-- I would say--
the most satisfying application

00:50:59.449 --> 00:51:00.240
of it in some ways.

00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:04.070
Just because you end up with
equations that all you can do

00:51:04.070 --> 00:51:04.630
is plot them.

00:51:04.630 --> 00:51:06.500
And it's useful to be
able to recapitulate,

00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:09.250
to understand how the figures
from that paper come about.

00:51:09.250 --> 00:51:14.110
But at the same time
it's not always--

00:51:14.110 --> 00:51:19.851
after you find the solution,
you don't feel so happy about it

00:51:19.851 --> 00:51:20.350
either.

00:51:20.350 --> 00:51:23.510
Because in terms of complexity
as a function of time,

00:51:23.510 --> 00:51:25.020
things always start out simple.

00:51:25.020 --> 00:51:27.160
And then in the course
of the calculations

00:51:27.160 --> 00:51:28.470
things get complicated.

00:51:28.470 --> 00:51:30.400
And the problems
that are fun to solve

00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:32.150
are the cases where
it comes simple again.

00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:36.624
This one-- it never
quite converges.

00:51:36.624 --> 00:51:38.540
I do want to talk about
the stability analysis

00:51:38.540 --> 00:51:41.232
so that you can understand
the calculation that

00:51:41.232 --> 00:51:41.940
was in the notes.

00:51:41.940 --> 00:51:44.169
But also so that you can
just get some more intuition

00:51:44.169 --> 00:51:45.960
about some of the other
problems that we're

00:51:45.960 --> 00:51:47.710
going to be solving
in the next few weeks.

00:51:51.170 --> 00:51:56.040
Just to make sure that we're all
talking about the same thing,

00:51:56.040 --> 00:51:58.930
it's useful to start
by just making sure

00:51:58.930 --> 00:52:02.269
that in a one
dimensional problem,

00:52:02.269 --> 00:52:03.935
we understand what
we mean by stability.

00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:15.800
We're going to be fast.

00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:20.760
X equals 0 is stable
if and only if what?

00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:37.710
I'll give you 10 seconds.

00:52:47.910 --> 00:52:48.710
Ready?

00:52:48.710 --> 00:52:50.295
Three, two, one.

00:52:53.321 --> 00:52:53.820
All right.

00:52:56.340 --> 00:53:01.530
So this is always--
So there's actually

00:53:01.530 --> 00:53:05.060
a fair number of answers here.

00:53:05.060 --> 00:53:10.990
And this is tricky because
the temptation is always

00:53:10.990 --> 00:53:12.880
to jump into the two
dimensional stability

00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:15.350
analysis, or the n dimensional
stability analysis.

00:53:15.350 --> 00:53:19.150
And the thing is that
we have to make sure

00:53:19.150 --> 00:53:21.640
that we are completely
comfortable with a one-- talked

00:53:21.640 --> 00:53:24.223
about one dimension before you
talk about multiple dimensions,

00:53:24.223 --> 00:53:25.630
because then everything is lost.

00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:32.690
I'm not going to have
you guys discuss,

00:53:32.690 --> 00:53:37.380
the but it's going to
be C. Many people are

00:53:37.380 --> 00:53:41.980
saying A or other things.

00:53:41.980 --> 00:53:45.060
There is a context in
which this guy comes in.

00:53:45.060 --> 00:53:46.120
But let's just make sure.

00:53:50.310 --> 00:53:51.440
So x equal to 0.

00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:54.520
Now first of all, is this
thing-- is x equals 0,

00:53:54.520 --> 00:53:58.250
is it always a fixed
point of the system?

00:53:58.250 --> 00:53:59.060
Yes.

00:53:59.060 --> 00:54:01.280
So fixed point means that
if you go right there, then

00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:03.015
in principle you
don't move off it.

00:54:03.015 --> 00:54:04.890
So it doesn't say anything
about whether it's

00:54:04.890 --> 00:54:05.750
stable or unstable.

00:54:05.750 --> 00:54:08.960
But if x equals zero, then
indeed x dot is equal to 0.

00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:11.240
So that's a fixed point.

00:54:11.240 --> 00:54:16.380
But if you have positive x--
in order for that to be stable,

00:54:16.380 --> 00:54:18.220
you have to have a
negative change in x.

00:54:23.917 --> 00:54:26.250
So if you talk about the
behavior as a function of time,

00:54:26.250 --> 00:54:28.160
this function of x here.

00:54:28.160 --> 00:54:31.190
If you start out above 0,
the definition of stable

00:54:31.190 --> 00:54:33.470
is if you go a little bit
away, you should come back.

00:54:38.350 --> 00:54:41.780
And that means that x
dot has to be negative.

00:54:41.780 --> 00:54:44.710
So if positive x-- and
similarly if x is negative,

00:54:44.710 --> 00:54:49.380
you want it to be
stable, then you

00:54:49.380 --> 00:54:50.630
need the x dot to be positive.

00:54:50.630 --> 00:54:54.130
So this is-- A less than 0.

00:54:54.130 --> 00:54:57.220
Now there is a context in
which a stability condition

00:54:57.220 --> 00:54:59.570
looks something a little
bit more like this.

00:54:59.570 --> 00:55:05.080
And can somebody say when
it is that you get something

00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:06.505
to look-- condition around 1?

00:55:11.430 --> 00:55:11.930
Yes?

00:55:11.930 --> 00:55:12.870
AUDIENCE: Discreet.

00:55:12.870 --> 00:55:15.270
PROFESSOR: Yeah, in
discrete maps then indeed

00:55:15.270 --> 00:55:17.890
the condition for stability
looks something like this.

00:55:17.890 --> 00:55:21.590
If you have something that
looks the x of t plus 1,

00:55:21.590 --> 00:55:32.030
is equal to axt, then
if the condition for x

00:55:32.030 --> 00:55:35.857
equal to 0 being stable is for
indeed a to be less than 1.

00:55:35.857 --> 00:55:38.440
Or it's in this case it's really
the magnitude of a being less

00:55:38.440 --> 00:55:38.940
than 1.

00:55:38.940 --> 00:55:41.190
Because in that case
you might get hopping.

00:55:41.190 --> 00:55:43.560
But then the condition
is around the 1 thing,

00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:46.110
whereas here 0
[INAUDIBLE] indeed.

00:55:46.110 --> 00:55:50.300
Solution is different-- it's
going to go exponentially

00:55:50.300 --> 00:55:54.650
to-- so x is a function
of time is just

00:55:54.650 --> 00:55:58.580
going to be some x naught
e to the-- and is it at,

00:55:58.580 --> 00:56:02.900
or a is less than 0.

00:56:02.900 --> 00:56:03.800
It's just at, right?

00:56:09.250 --> 00:56:12.510
And in this case, we
just have one dimension.

00:56:12.510 --> 00:56:16.520
So the eigenvector
[INAUDIBLE] is really just x.

00:56:16.520 --> 00:56:19.270
There's just one eigenvalue,
and a is indeed the eigenvalue.

00:56:19.270 --> 00:56:22.710
So the stability for x
equals 0 to be stable

00:56:22.710 --> 00:56:26.290
is that all-- and in
general, for n dimensions,

00:56:26.290 --> 00:56:28.965
is that you need all the
eigenvalues to be less than 0.

00:56:28.965 --> 00:56:30.840
And in this case, a is
indeed the eigenvalue.

00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:33.260
And you need that
to be less than 0.

00:56:33.260 --> 00:56:35.480
So if you're not
comfortable with this,

00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:38.340
or you got something
other than C,

00:56:38.340 --> 00:56:43.960
then I think it's essential
that you take the time now

00:56:43.960 --> 00:56:47.192
to go over all of these ideas.

00:56:47.192 --> 00:56:48.150
First in one dimension.

00:56:48.150 --> 00:56:49.941
Make sure you're all
comfortable with that.

00:56:49.941 --> 00:56:52.160
But then to look again
at these two dimensional,

00:56:52.160 --> 00:56:53.800
high dimensional
stability analyses.

00:56:53.800 --> 00:56:57.402
Because if these things
you're finding tricky

00:56:57.402 --> 00:56:59.360
just because it's been
a while since you looked

00:56:59.360 --> 00:57:00.680
at this stuff, that's fine.

00:57:00.680 --> 00:57:02.930
But if you don't spend
the time to iron out now,

00:57:02.930 --> 00:57:06.890
then everything gets
much more painful later.

00:57:06.890 --> 00:57:11.970
I highly recommend Strogatz's
book on dynamical systems.

00:57:11.970 --> 00:57:15.190
It's a beautiful
book with just as

00:57:15.190 --> 00:57:17.300
clear as a textbook could be.

00:57:17.300 --> 00:57:20.150
So that book is available at
various libraries and reading

00:57:20.150 --> 00:57:21.100
rooms and so forth.

00:57:21.100 --> 00:57:22.840
So it's a great reference.

00:57:25.570 --> 00:57:28.820
Now we want to do is
generalize this idea

00:57:28.820 --> 00:57:30.930
to think about in n dimensions.

00:57:30.930 --> 00:57:36.470
So now what we have a vector x.

00:57:36.470 --> 00:57:41.650
And there's going to be some
matrix A that-- oh, and x dot.

00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:47.430
So the change in
this vector x is

00:57:47.430 --> 00:57:51.660
going to be described by
a linear set of equations,

00:57:51.660 --> 00:57:53.535
so that they can be
specified by some matrix.

00:57:57.050 --> 00:57:58.540
To determine the
stability, we're

00:57:58.540 --> 00:58:04.500
going to then look at the
eigenvalues of this matrix.

00:58:04.500 --> 00:58:07.770
Now in many cases in this
class, what we're going to do

00:58:07.770 --> 00:58:11.259
is we're going to find that
some set of non-linear equations

00:58:11.259 --> 00:58:13.050
has a fixed point
somewhere, and then we're

00:58:13.050 --> 00:58:15.760
going to linearize
around that fixed point

00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:18.570
to convert into a linear
problem that looks like this.

00:58:21.810 --> 00:58:24.552
But for now what
we're going to do--

00:58:24.552 --> 00:58:26.385
the general statement
is for n n dimensions.

00:58:29.070 --> 00:58:33.060
You want all the eigenvalues--
lambda I in particular--

00:58:33.060 --> 00:58:37.740
to be the real part
to be less than 0.

00:58:37.740 --> 00:58:40.110
And that has to be true
for all the eigenvalues.

00:58:40.110 --> 00:58:43.210
We're going to be talking
about the conditions in a two

00:58:43.210 --> 00:58:44.695
dimensional system
where there are

00:58:44.695 --> 00:58:47.070
in principles and shortcuts,
but it's all the same thing.

00:58:47.070 --> 00:58:48.036
It's all that you need.

00:58:48.036 --> 00:58:50.160
The real part of all the
eigenvalues be less than 0

00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:51.409
for the fixed point be stable.

00:59:10.920 --> 00:59:12.670
So for now what we're
going to do is we're

00:59:12.670 --> 00:59:14.930
just going to imagine
that we have-- assume we

00:59:14.930 --> 00:59:19.010
have two dimensional problem.

00:59:19.010 --> 00:59:21.200
This vector x, we're
going to write as x and y.

00:59:28.370 --> 00:59:31.050
So we can write the
dynamics like this.

00:59:34.180 --> 00:59:34.750
This is x.

00:59:34.750 --> 00:59:36.035
This is x dot, y dot.

00:59:36.035 --> 00:59:37.410
And this is really
the same thing

00:59:37.410 --> 00:59:43.190
as saying that x dot can be
described by some ax plus by,

00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:47.675
and y dot is some cx plus dy.

00:59:52.730 --> 00:59:55.360
And so we want to be as
comfortable as we can

00:59:55.360 --> 00:59:57.255
with all the
possible things that

00:59:57.255 --> 01:00:03.710
could happen in these two linear
and differential equations.

01:00:03.710 --> 01:00:06.470
And particularly we want to
know what the condition for 0,

01:00:06.470 --> 01:00:09.090
0 being stable?

01:00:09.090 --> 01:00:15.760
0, 0 is stable if and
only if-- now there's

01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:18.021
a rule that you
found in your reading

01:00:18.021 --> 01:00:20.020
having to do with the
trace and the determinant.

01:00:20.020 --> 01:00:21.980
So trace is the
sum of these two.

01:00:21.980 --> 01:00:25.280
Determinant is product
minus the product here.

01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:27.800
Now this is not
the kind of thing

01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:29.020
that you have to memorize.

01:00:29.020 --> 01:00:31.270
But it's useful to know
that there is a simple rule,

01:00:31.270 --> 01:00:33.770
because it allows you to quickly
determine whether something

01:00:33.770 --> 01:00:35.900
could possibly be stable.

01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:37.400
And you don't have
to memorize it,

01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:43.460
but you should be able to
figure it back out later.

01:00:43.460 --> 01:00:48.747
So what we have is the trace of
this thing being less than 0--

01:00:48.747 --> 01:00:50.330
so I'm going to give
you some options.

01:00:53.930 --> 01:00:56.560
Now of course, you can
always look at your notes

01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:58.437
and that is not
going to help you.

01:00:58.437 --> 01:01:00.520
You're not being graded
on your answers right now.

01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:04.164
I'm going to encourage you
to try and think about it

01:01:04.164 --> 01:01:06.580
and see if you can recapitulate
what this thing should be.

01:01:06.580 --> 01:01:09.390
So it's less than,
greater than--

01:01:22.380 --> 01:01:24.230
So for example you
can start to think

01:01:24.230 --> 01:01:29.500
about-- you should be able
to write down some equation

01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:32.120
that you know is stable.

01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:35.010
And figure out, OK, what
conditions would it satisfy.

01:01:35.010 --> 01:01:39.500
That's a common, useful trick
to be able to do in life.

01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:43.019
To dredge these
things out of memory.

01:01:43.019 --> 01:01:44.310
Do you understand the question?

01:01:48.740 --> 01:01:51.830
I'm going to give you
30 seconds because it's

01:01:51.830 --> 01:01:56.751
well worth trying to figure
out what this rule should be.

01:01:56.751 --> 01:01:58.250
So from the reading
you know there's

01:01:58.250 --> 01:02:00.940
some rule about the trace
and the determinant.

01:02:00.940 --> 01:02:02.970
And indeed they
both have to be true

01:02:02.970 --> 01:02:07.280
in order-- this is an and sign.

01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:08.544
May be an and sign.

01:02:46.582 --> 01:02:48.190
Do you need more time?

01:02:48.190 --> 01:02:53.340
It's OK if you haven't actually
been able to recapitulate this.

01:02:53.340 --> 01:02:58.454
But it's useful
to think about it.

01:02:58.454 --> 01:03:00.120
Should we go ahead
and vote just to see?

01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:02.200
I'm just curious where we are.

01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:02.830
Ready?

01:03:02.830 --> 01:03:07.630
Three, two, one.

01:03:07.630 --> 01:03:10.770
So we have a lots of B's.

01:03:10.770 --> 01:03:15.670
And can somebody give me
an example of a matrix A

01:03:15.670 --> 01:03:18.506
that really ought to be stable?

01:03:18.506 --> 01:03:19.006
Yeah?

01:03:19.006 --> 01:03:20.440
AUDIENCE: Negative identity.

01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:22.010
PROFESSOR: Negative
identity, OK.

01:03:22.010 --> 01:03:26.750
So if the matrix A is
something that's minus 1 here.

01:03:26.750 --> 01:03:30.800
0, 0 minus 1.

01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:33.360
Then x and y are uncoupled.

01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:37.512
x decays exponentially,
y decays exponentially.

01:03:37.512 --> 01:03:39.220
Now we can just directly
say, well, this,

01:03:39.220 --> 01:03:41.780
the trace is
definitely negative,

01:03:41.780 --> 01:03:44.610
and the determinant's positive.

01:03:44.610 --> 01:03:46.460
It's 1 minus 0.

01:03:46.460 --> 01:03:48.939
So that gets us here.

01:03:48.939 --> 01:03:50.980
Because I think there are
many situations in life

01:03:50.980 --> 01:03:53.660
that are like this, where you
know that there's some rule

01:03:53.660 --> 01:03:55.480
and you can't
remember what it is.

01:03:55.480 --> 01:03:57.211
You don't need to
actually remember,

01:03:57.211 --> 01:03:58.710
once you know that
there's the rule,

01:03:58.710 --> 01:04:02.130
then you can figure out
what it had to have been.

01:04:02.130 --> 01:04:03.480
This is not a proof.

01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:05.070
The proof is only a few lines.

01:04:05.070 --> 01:04:07.940
You can do it, but the point
is that this kind of situation

01:04:07.940 --> 01:04:09.090
comes up a lot.

01:04:09.090 --> 01:04:11.274
It's useful to just
have simple things

01:04:11.274 --> 01:04:12.940
that you know what
the answer has to be,

01:04:12.940 --> 01:04:15.530
and then that allows you to
figure out where things were.

01:04:18.470 --> 01:04:20.560
And indeed what you'll
find is that for a two

01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:22.889
dimensional system,
this condition

01:04:22.889 --> 01:04:24.680
that the trace of the
matrix is less than 0

01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:26.830
and the determinant
is larger, that

01:04:26.830 --> 01:04:29.760
is equivalent to the
statement that the real part

01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:31.470
of both eigenvalues
is less than 0.

01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:38.784
And there's the derivation is
simple, and it's in your notes.

01:04:38.784 --> 01:04:41.434
Are there any questions
about where we are right now?

01:04:47.070 --> 01:04:50.200
So what I want to just
say a few more things

01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:53.610
about the trajectories here.

01:04:53.610 --> 01:04:56.920
Can somebody explain
the notion of what's

01:04:56.920 --> 01:04:58.860
an intuitive statement
about the eigenvectors

01:04:58.860 --> 01:05:00.309
that you get out here?

01:05:08.570 --> 01:05:10.430
Why do we like eigenvectors?

01:05:10.430 --> 01:05:12.340
What are they useful for?

01:05:19.052 --> 01:05:21.052
AUDIENCE: Decoupling the
differential equations.

01:05:21.052 --> 01:05:23.300
PROFESSOR: Right, so
they're decoupling,

01:05:23.300 --> 01:05:25.730
and there's a sense
that-- I guess

01:05:25.730 --> 01:05:29.580
the way I like to think
about this is that you have

01:05:29.580 --> 01:05:32.830
a fixed point say, like this.

01:05:32.830 --> 01:05:37.250
Now if these things
are stable, that

01:05:37.250 --> 01:05:39.300
means the arrows are
all say coming in.

01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:56.140
Are these eigenvalues--
are they purely real,

01:05:56.140 --> 01:05:57.199
or are they complex?

01:05:57.199 --> 01:05:57.990
Reminder, somebody?

01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:03.480
Real and negative.

01:06:03.480 --> 01:06:05.550
There's no imaginary component.

01:06:05.550 --> 01:06:08.970
This is a stable fixed point
with real negative eigenvalues.

01:06:08.970 --> 01:06:11.270
Now the idea of
these eigenvectors

01:06:11.270 --> 01:06:12.810
is that these are
the two directions

01:06:12.810 --> 01:06:15.393
in which if you start out on one
of them, you'll stay on them.

01:06:18.260 --> 01:06:21.040
And in general then you
can-- any other trajectory

01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:24.180
you can decompose as a
combination of the pads

01:06:24.180 --> 01:06:24.720
on the two.

01:06:29.530 --> 01:06:33.620
The position as function
of time can always

01:06:33.620 --> 01:06:42.150
described as the sum
of the eigenvectors

01:06:42.150 --> 01:06:44.340
where you grow or
you shrink along

01:06:44.340 --> 01:06:47.419
each eigenvector exponentially.

01:06:47.419 --> 01:06:49.460
Now for this thing to be
stable, all these lambda

01:06:49.460 --> 01:06:50.668
I's are going to be negative.

01:06:53.400 --> 01:07:02.550
We have this property
that-- that the dynamics

01:07:02.550 --> 01:07:06.680
of this matrix kind of keep
you along the direction

01:07:06.680 --> 01:07:09.950
of the eigenvector.

01:07:09.950 --> 01:07:13.456
What this is saying is that
if you start somewhere random,

01:07:13.456 --> 01:07:14.830
that is off one
the eigenvectors,

01:07:14.830 --> 01:07:18.530
then you can decompose
the trajectory along each.

01:07:18.530 --> 01:07:23.110
But I just want to
highlight that it's often

01:07:23.110 --> 01:07:25.610
useful to draw what these
things end up looking like.

01:07:31.372 --> 01:07:33.330
Now I want to make sure
I get this one correct.

01:07:39.295 --> 01:07:41.670
I'm a little bit worried I'm
going to do something funny.

01:07:44.430 --> 01:07:48.440
So here-- we're going to say
this is v1 and this is v2.

01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:50.854
So this direction
is one eigenvector,

01:07:50.854 --> 01:07:52.020
this direction is the other.

01:08:03.311 --> 01:08:05.560
So let's imagine that the
trajectories look like this.

01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:08.500
The question is which
eigenvalue is closer to 0?

01:08:31.149 --> 01:08:42.840
Is it A eigenvector v1, or B
eigenvector-- So this is really

01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:45.620
lambda 1 verses lambda 2.

01:08:45.620 --> 01:08:47.410
1 is closer to 0 than is 2.

01:08:51.149 --> 01:08:57.220
Which of the eigenvalues
is closer to 0?

01:08:57.220 --> 01:09:01.359
I'll give you 20 seconds to
think about this because it's

01:09:01.359 --> 01:09:04.029
useful to be able to
extract these things

01:09:04.029 --> 01:09:05.220
from the trajectories.

01:09:29.594 --> 01:09:30.510
Do you need more time?

01:09:33.819 --> 01:09:37.350
And it's fine if
you don't really

01:09:37.350 --> 01:09:42.640
understand how you can get to
this question from this figure,

01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:51.069
then go ahead and flash C, D, or
E, just so I know where we are.

01:09:51.069 --> 01:09:51.670
Let's vote.

01:09:51.670 --> 01:09:52.170
Ready?

01:09:52.170 --> 01:09:54.335
Three, two, one.

01:09:57.280 --> 01:10:00.350
All right, so there's
at least a majority

01:10:00.350 --> 01:10:04.470
are saying that it's
going to be lambda 2.

01:10:04.470 --> 01:10:07.651
Can somebody offer why that is?

01:10:07.651 --> 01:10:08.150
Yes?

01:10:08.150 --> 01:10:12.632
AUDIENCE: I sort of
see it as whichever

01:10:12.632 --> 01:10:14.877
one is bigger is
going to be more

01:10:14.877 --> 01:10:17.053
effective at squeezing
things toward the origin

01:10:17.053 --> 01:10:17.955
along that axis.

01:10:17.955 --> 01:10:21.100
PROFESSOR: OK and bigger-- and
you're saying more negative,

01:10:21.100 --> 01:10:24.070
in this case, you're saying?

01:10:24.070 --> 01:10:24.840
Yes, right.

01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:26.940
So yeah that's right.

01:10:26.940 --> 01:10:32.400
So there's some notion
that lambda 1 has

01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:33.810
to be more negative
than lambda 2

01:10:33.810 --> 01:10:39.840
because you first collapse along
the direction of eigenvector 1,

01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:42.255
and then you slowly come
in along the direction

01:10:42.255 --> 01:10:44.980
of eigenvector 2.

01:10:44.980 --> 01:10:49.470
That's saying that you have
these two exponential decays,

01:10:49.470 --> 01:10:51.180
and the directional
on the eigenvector 1

01:10:51.180 --> 01:10:55.820
is more rapid than the
directional on eigenvector 2.

01:10:55.820 --> 01:10:58.760
I think in many of these
cases in dynamical systems,

01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:01.040
differential equations,
it's hugely valuable

01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:03.490
to be able to draw
the trajectories.

01:11:03.490 --> 01:11:04.907
So in many cases,
what we're going

01:11:04.907 --> 01:11:06.573
to do over the course
of the semester is

01:11:06.573 --> 01:11:09.140
we're going to have a simple
pair of differential equations

01:11:09.140 --> 01:11:11.090
that are going to
be two proteins,

01:11:11.090 --> 01:11:15.690
or they're going to be
rabbits and foxes or whatever.

01:11:15.690 --> 01:11:18.324
So we're going to locate
where the fixed points are.

01:11:18.324 --> 01:11:19.740
And then we're
going to figure out

01:11:19.740 --> 01:11:21.740
the stabilities and
the eigenvectors.

01:11:21.740 --> 01:11:24.520
And then we can really
understand the entire dynamics

01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:27.700
of the system without
solving the full thing,

01:11:27.700 --> 01:11:29.064
without using a computer.

01:11:29.064 --> 01:11:31.230
But just by figuring out
where the fixed points are,

01:11:31.230 --> 01:11:32.810
and then the dynamics
around there.

01:11:32.810 --> 01:11:35.200
Then you can
basically understand

01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:37.590
all the dynamics of the system.

01:11:37.590 --> 01:11:40.080
But you have to
make sure that you

01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:43.690
develop intuition of how systems
behave near their fixed points.

01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:51.050
Now this is a case where both
of the eigenvalues were real.

01:11:51.050 --> 01:11:56.094
But of course, if you
have complex eigenvalues,

01:11:56.094 --> 01:11:57.510
if you do the
calculations, you'll

01:11:57.510 --> 01:11:59.017
see that the
eigenvalues are going

01:11:59.017 --> 01:12:00.930
to be a complex
conjugates of each other.

01:12:00.930 --> 01:12:02.470
And there you get spirals.

01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:13.670
So trajectories
might look like so.

01:12:13.670 --> 01:12:17.160
So there are two qualitatively
different ways that the fixed

01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:18.500
point can be stable.

01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:23.730
You can have spiraling through
a state of the fixed point,

01:12:23.730 --> 01:12:29.080
or you can come in via
these straight lines.

01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:31.420
Of course, the specific
trajectories in some cases,

01:12:31.420 --> 01:12:32.090
can be curved.

01:12:32.090 --> 01:12:34.140
And so if you look at a
particular trajectory,

01:12:34.140 --> 01:12:37.170
sometimes even these can
look a little bit spirally,

01:12:37.170 --> 01:12:40.580
so be careful.

01:12:40.580 --> 01:12:44.130
Those are the two
basic ways it works.

01:12:44.130 --> 01:12:46.950
There's a simple way
of getting a sense

01:12:46.950 --> 01:12:50.220
of the dynamics of a system,
as a function of the trace

01:12:50.220 --> 01:12:52.180
and the determinant.

01:12:52.180 --> 01:12:55.180
So what we have--
something here.

01:12:59.296 --> 01:13:04.150
If you go ahead and you do
the calculation, what you find

01:13:04.150 --> 01:13:14.860
is that the two eigenvalues are
going to be described by this.

01:13:30.574 --> 01:13:32.990
And then the basic dynamics
are going to be the following.

01:13:32.990 --> 01:13:41.050
So down here, you have a case
where the eigenvalues are real,

01:13:41.050 --> 01:13:44.231
and they're of opposite sign.

01:13:44.231 --> 01:13:46.105
And in this case, is
that stable or unstable?

01:13:51.050 --> 01:13:52.660
Unstable.

01:13:52.660 --> 01:13:55.020
So in order for it to be
stable, all the eigenvalues

01:13:55.020 --> 01:13:56.890
have to have negative
real components.

01:13:56.890 --> 01:13:58.840
So if they have opposite
sign, one of them

01:13:58.840 --> 01:13:59.890
is going to be positive.

01:13:59.890 --> 01:14:01.430
So this is all
unstable down here.

01:14:04.130 --> 01:14:07.300
Over here you have a case
where the eigenvalues are real,

01:14:07.300 --> 01:14:08.410
greater than 0.

01:14:08.410 --> 01:14:10.870
So in this case,
the trajectories

01:14:10.870 --> 01:14:14.300
are also coming out somehow.

01:14:14.300 --> 01:14:17.910
All right, here, this is the
case where they are real,

01:14:17.910 --> 01:14:19.540
but now both less than 0.

01:14:19.540 --> 01:14:21.890
So this is again, this is
like what we drew here, where

01:14:21.890 --> 01:14:25.200
everything is stable coming in.

01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:29.410
And up here is where
we get the spirals.

01:14:29.410 --> 01:14:32.970
But over here, it's the
real part is less than 0.

01:14:32.970 --> 01:14:36.547
So this is where we have
the spirals coming in,

01:14:36.547 --> 01:14:38.630
whereas over here, the
real part is greater than 0

01:14:38.630 --> 01:14:39.980
and we have spirals coming out.

01:14:44.340 --> 01:14:45.747
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:14:45.747 --> 01:14:47.080
Uh, that would have been useful.

01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:50.775
So this is in the trace of A
and this is in the determinant.

01:14:55.400 --> 01:15:01.460
So these are the variety
of possible outcomes

01:15:01.460 --> 01:15:05.030
when you have a two
dimensional system that's

01:15:05.030 --> 01:15:07.403
already a linear two
dimensional system.

01:15:15.117 --> 01:15:16.700
And this is indeed
consistent with it,

01:15:16.700 --> 01:15:18.075
to have a stable
fixed point, you

01:15:18.075 --> 01:15:19.600
need to have the
trace less than 0,

01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:21.113
and the determinant
greater than 0.

01:15:21.113 --> 01:15:22.154
So it's in this quadrant.

01:15:30.390 --> 01:15:48.700
Now it's-- finally it's useful
to-- so let's just for now,

01:15:48.700 --> 01:15:50.910
stick with the linear system.

01:15:50.910 --> 01:16:00.680
And just imagine a case
where we have in this A-- so

01:16:00.680 --> 01:16:05.080
remember it's A,
B, C, and D. So we

01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:08.290
saw one way in which this
thing could be stable.

01:16:08.290 --> 01:16:10.850
Was that if b and
c were both equal

01:16:10.850 --> 01:16:13.610
to 0, so there's no
cross interaction,

01:16:13.610 --> 01:16:15.880
but a and d were both
less than 0, then

01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:17.220
it's all trivially stable.

01:16:17.220 --> 01:16:18.690
Now the question
is, if something

01:16:18.690 --> 01:16:22.430
that looks like this, a
is equal to minus 2 and d

01:16:22.430 --> 01:16:25.720
is equal to plus 1.

01:16:25.720 --> 01:16:28.304
Questions is, could
such a system be stable?

01:16:37.570 --> 01:16:39.367
So I'm seeing some nods.

01:16:39.367 --> 01:16:41.200
And on the face of this,
you say, oh, that's

01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:43.030
a little bit surprising.

01:16:43.030 --> 01:16:46.790
Because d being plus
1, what that's saying

01:16:46.790 --> 01:16:50.740
is that y on its
own is unstable.

01:16:50.740 --> 01:16:54.967
So if you start out
with no x and no y,

01:16:54.967 --> 01:16:57.550
and you add a little bit of y,
y starts growing exponentially.

01:17:00.550 --> 01:17:06.160
So y on its own is unstable,
but x is stable its own.

01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:09.010
And the trace
being less than 0--

01:17:09.010 --> 01:17:14.130
that's saying that there's
some sense in which if y

01:17:14.130 --> 01:17:16.920
is unstable on its own,
then x has to somehow be

01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:20.390
more stable than y is unstable.

01:17:20.390 --> 01:17:24.520
Because the sum of those things
still has to be negative.

01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:26.335
Now that was necessary,
but not sufficient,

01:17:26.335 --> 01:17:27.460
in order to have stability.

01:17:27.460 --> 01:17:31.520
Because we also need to have a
condition on the determinant.

01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:37.119
Now so the trace of a
here-- that's minus 1.

01:17:37.119 --> 01:17:37.910
That's less than 0.

01:17:37.910 --> 01:17:38.840
OK, that's great.

01:17:38.840 --> 01:17:44.020
Now the determinant-- now
it's going to be a times d.

01:17:44.020 --> 01:17:47.440
That's minus 2.

01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:49.960
But then we also have to
say minus b times c, right?

01:17:52.470 --> 01:17:55.500
And this thing has
to be greater than 0.

01:17:55.500 --> 01:17:58.280
So what you see here
is that b and c-- they

01:17:58.280 --> 01:18:03.880
have to have opposite signs
order for this thing to work,

01:18:03.880 --> 01:18:07.310
in order for the
origin to be stable.

01:18:07.310 --> 01:18:09.785
And the product has
to somehow be strong.

01:18:13.070 --> 01:18:17.240
Now this makes sense, because
of course, if b and c,

01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:20.050
or even for matter,
just one of them were 0,

01:18:20.050 --> 01:18:23.530
then it would be impossible
to get the stability.

01:18:23.530 --> 01:18:28.480
But for example, if we
have some situation where

01:18:28.480 --> 01:18:35.020
we have some x that's inhibiting
itself-- that's a here--

01:18:35.020 --> 01:18:37.310
but then y is activating itself.

01:18:37.310 --> 01:18:42.750
So y here is somehow
on its own, unstable.

01:18:42.750 --> 01:18:47.190
Then what you need is you
need maybe something that

01:18:47.190 --> 01:18:49.280
looks like this.

01:18:49.280 --> 01:18:52.240
Some cross activation
and or repression.

01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:55.710
And what's interesting is
that it doesn't matter which

01:18:55.710 --> 01:18:58.560
of the two, b or c is negative.

01:18:58.560 --> 01:19:03.200
You can get actually, the origin
to be stable in either way.

01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:08.710
But in this situation, you need
the direction of the regulation

01:19:08.710 --> 01:19:10.720
to be in opposite directions.

01:19:15.650 --> 01:19:17.070
And if you'd like,
you could then

01:19:17.070 --> 01:19:23.540
play with-- you could
think for example

01:19:23.540 --> 01:19:27.090
about the directions of these
trajectories around the origin,

01:19:27.090 --> 01:19:27.970
and so forth.

01:19:27.970 --> 01:19:31.390
But it's useful, I think, to
play with the simplest toy

01:19:31.390 --> 01:19:33.797
systems that you can imagine,
just so that you can get

01:19:33.797 --> 01:19:35.880
a sense of what are the
basic ingredients that you

01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:38.530
need in order to get stability
in something like this.

01:19:38.530 --> 01:19:42.027
Because once you start doing
the whole linearization

01:19:42.027 --> 01:19:43.860
around the fixed point,
and then calculating

01:19:43.860 --> 01:19:46.430
traces and determinants,
you're not going to have it.

01:19:46.430 --> 01:19:47.880
You're going to lose all
your intuition about that

01:19:47.880 --> 01:19:49.004
about things at that stage.

01:19:49.004 --> 01:19:51.550
So it's useful to make
sure that you nail things

01:19:51.550 --> 01:19:53.320
down in this context.

01:19:53.320 --> 01:19:56.660
We are out of time,
so I'll let you go.
