00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.850
PROFESSOR: So today
we're going to take

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:29.270
a little bit of a lightning
tour through some basic topics

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:34.060
on chemical enzyme kinetics,
before thinking a little bit

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.110
about some, what you might
call, simple input-output

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.814
relationships, in terms
of gene expression.

00:00:40.814 --> 00:00:42.230
I've got separation
of time scale,

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.910
and also this basic notion
that for a stable protein

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:47.809
there's a natural
time scale over which

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:49.350
the concentration
will go up or down,

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.640
and that's dictated by
the cell generation time.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.610
At the end, we'll then talk
about different ways you get

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:59.800
this thing of ultrasensitivity.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.080
So, how is it that
you can make it

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.090
so that a small change in
the input concentration,

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:07.090
say the concentration of
a transcription factor,

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.010
might be able to lead to a
large change in the output,

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.930
or the gene expression
of its target?

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.620
We'll talk about
how you can have,

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.760
for example, cooperative
binding at the promoter,

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.520
or you can have multimerization,
kind of leads to similar things

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:19.200
here.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.420
But also, we're going
to talk about this idea

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.860
of molecular titration.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.980
So if you have another protein
that acts as kind of a sponge,

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.780
then this connect can
lead to a similar effect.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.450
And this is indeed observed
in various natural contexts.

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:43.010
So this is motivated by a work
by Nick Buchler, B-U-C-H-L-E-R.

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.680
Turns out I was down
at Princeton, no sorry,

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.920
I was out at Duke yesterday, and
so I got to hang out with Nick

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.580
and talk about this work.

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.669
I had previously told him
that in my first lecture

00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:56.210
in the systems
biology class, we like

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.440
to discuss this molecular
titration effect.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.880
He was instrumental in
elucidating how it worked.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.910
All right so let's go
ahead and get started.

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.904
So hopefully you all
have these cards.

00:02:11.904 --> 00:02:14.070
We're going to start out
with some simple questions,

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:15.610
just to make sure
that you know how

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.040
to use the complicated
devices that

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.320
are sitting in front of you.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.819
OK?

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.250
So what we want
to do is to start

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.360
by thinking about a situation
where you have two molecules.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.300
We're going to
call them E and S,

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.620
and of course, you can imagine
what these might possibly stand

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.140
for in one context or another.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.840
There are two rates
here that are describing

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.140
the rate that these molecules,
E and S, find each other, Kf.

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.780
And Kr is defining the rate
at which this complex is

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.390
going to fall apart.

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:56.820
So there's this
forward rate that

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.870
is sum Kf, times
concentration of E,

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.350
times the
concentration of S. Now

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.640
I'd say for the first
part of this lecture,

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.360
we will indeed use the chemistry
convention of concentrations

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.680
here, although we will quickly
get tired of these brackets

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.930
and we'll just start
writing the letters.

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.397
And hopefully it is self
evident in the context

00:03:19.397 --> 00:03:21.230
that I'm referring to
a concentration rather

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.980
than something else, but if
you're ever confused, please

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.440
ask.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.630
So this is forward rate,
and then the reverse rate

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:31.890
is something similar.

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.024
So we have this Kr.

00:03:34.024 --> 00:03:35.440
Now this is just
the concentration

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:36.490
of the complex ES.

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:42.360
Many of you have spent
a lot of time thinking

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.770
about how we often
define things.

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.670
This Kd, dissociation
constant, is defined

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:52.760
as the ratio Kr over Kf.

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.682
Now, just so we can practice
using our cards, what

00:03:58.682 --> 00:04:03.615
we're going to ask first is what
the units of this Kd thing is.

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.260
Now, in general, when
I ask such a question,

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.875
I will give you some
A, B, C, D options.

00:04:14.242 --> 00:04:16.200
You can start thinking
even before I write down

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.839
the options.

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:20.630
Yes?

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.130
I'll encourage you
to think before I

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:23.255
start writing down options.

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:34.070
So it's either dimensionless,
units of concentration,

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:39.790
1 over concentration,
1 over time,

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:42.740
and I will often include at
the bottom something that

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.080
simply is, don't know.

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.744
And that is if you're
really confused

00:04:48.744 --> 00:04:50.160
about what I'm
talking about, then

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.430
feel free to just flash me
that, and that at least tells me

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.480
that I'm gibbering nonsense.

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.440
So there's going to be a
very strict set of rules

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.620
for how we do these
flash cards, all right?

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.400
You don't get to vote
before I tell you to vote.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.226
You have to keep on thinking.

00:05:08.226 --> 00:05:09.850
If you think you know
the right answer,

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:14.460
check limits, just do whatever
it is to keep on thinking.

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.630
And then we vote simultaneously.

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:20.240
That way, it builds up the
tension, everyone gets excited,

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.000
and then you vote.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.312
It also provides
me an opportunity

00:05:24.312 --> 00:05:26.770
to make sure that I can see
that everybody's participating.

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.210
So if you don't vote, then
you have the opportunity

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.190
to tell the group what you think
the answer should be and why.

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:41.010
And the cards
they're both colored,

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:44.190
and they have letters on there,
so the letters correspond

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:45.689
to the answer.

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:46.730
We're all on top of this?

00:05:49.799 --> 00:05:51.090
Have you had a chance to think?

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:54.831
Or has my talking bothered you?

00:05:54.831 --> 00:05:55.330
Both.

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:56.490
OK.

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.980
So what we do is I'm going to
ask, do you need more time?

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:02.680
If you need more time, just
nod or something like that,

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.690
and if more than a few people
nod, I'll give you more time.

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:10.580
But you guys are
totally all right.

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.390
OK let's see how we are.

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:14.650
So then I'll say,
OK, we're ready.

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:17.060
And then we're going to go
three, two, one, and then

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:18.860
I want a vote by your chest.

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:21.250
You don't need to
display it to the group.

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:23.542
It's just here, and then
tell me what you think.

00:06:23.542 --> 00:06:24.250
All right, ready.

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:26.210
Three, two, one.

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:32.870
Broadly, people know
how to use the cards.

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:35.650
And there's a clear
majority of the group,

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:38.414
although it's not 100%, that
are saying that this thing is

00:06:38.414 --> 00:06:39.080
a concentration.

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:46.730
I'd say that if the group
is maybe between 25,

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:48.930
75% correct on these
sorts of things,

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:53.330
then I will often have you
pair off in, well, in pairs.

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:55.050
And the goal there
would be to try

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:56.883
to convince your neighbor
that you're right.

00:06:56.883 --> 00:06:59.680
In this case we're
a bit above 75%,

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:04.700
so I've already indicated
what the answer is.

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:09.800
Can somebody just quickly say,
why is this a concentration?

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:10.840
Maybe in the back.

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:12.963
AUDIENCE: So, we know
that both rates need

00:07:12.963 --> 00:07:14.270
to have the same dimensions--

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:16.769
PROFESSOR: Yeah, and what are
the dimensions of these rates?

00:07:16.769 --> 00:07:18.870
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:21.230
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:26.320
So, there are actually different
conventions, in principle,

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:31.960
but we will often be
working in numbers

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:33.654
in most of this
class, in which case

00:07:33.654 --> 00:07:35.320
it would actually
just be a 1 over time.

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:38.670
But depending on whether
you're doing chemistry-- So

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:41.100
the numerators may be
ambiguous, depending,

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:45.280
but the important thing is that
they're definitely the same.

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:48.140
These are definitely
going to be the same.

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:50.514
But it is true that in an
awful lot of this class,

00:07:50.514 --> 00:07:52.180
we're going to be
thinking about numbers

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:53.140
rather than the concentrations.

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:54.681
Because, for a lot
of the class we'll

00:07:54.681 --> 00:07:58.930
be thinking about finite
number fluctuations

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:03.020
of stochastic dynamics, in which
case, concentration, who knows

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:04.420
what's going to happen?

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:07.730
But these have to have
the same units, right?

00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:10.270
And the important thing here
is if you look at the right,

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:14.720
you see this guy has an
extra concentration up here.

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:18.690
So, I think this is, on the
one hand, a trivial point,

00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:21.097
but it's just really
easy to forget about

00:08:21.097 --> 00:08:21.930
as you move forward.

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:24.640
Because these things, they
look awfully similar, right?

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:27.430
There's a K, little
subscript something, right?

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:29.620
So just be careful about
this kind of thing.

00:08:34.929 --> 00:08:38.419
Are there any questions
about what I've said so far?

00:08:38.419 --> 00:08:39.610
So in these cases.

00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:41.640
I think that it's
really very useful

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:44.890
to try to get some intuition
for what's going on.

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:46.820
These are all just
definitions, but you

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:48.861
want to ask, well, what
happens if concentrations

00:08:48.861 --> 00:08:50.415
of various things move around?

00:08:50.415 --> 00:08:52.840
What we want to think
about is just the fraction.

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:56.420
And the reason we call this
E is because, for now, we

00:08:56.420 --> 00:09:03.550
might be calling this an enzyme
and, over here, a substrate,

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:06.370
something that the
enzyme is acting on.

00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:08.499
But we'll see that,
in many cases,

00:09:08.499 --> 00:09:10.540
we might be thinking about
one of these as being,

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:12.319
let's say, the piece
of DNA, and then

00:09:12.319 --> 00:09:13.610
this is not even the substrate.

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:15.885
Then maybe this is the
RNA polymerase that

00:09:15.885 --> 00:09:17.010
will lead to transcription.

00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:20.560
So in various contexts, we'll
think about these things having

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.510
different molecular identities.

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:26.360
But for now, E and S,
possibly enzyme substrate.

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:29.520
So the question is, if
for now we just think,

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:32.620
these are just two
molecules of whatever sort,

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:35.070
at some concentration, and
we just want to make sure

00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:37.040
that we are on top
of what's going

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:39.000
to happen if the
concentrations of each

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.390
of these molecular
components goes

00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:43.830
either to 0 or to infinity.

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:47.170
I think that before you
do any math in life,

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:49.510
it's good to just think
about these sorts of limits,

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:53.690
because it helps to make sure
that your intuition is correct.

00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:57.972
In many, many cases, if
you think about the problem

00:09:57.972 --> 00:10:00.180
before you do any math, then
when you go do the math,

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:01.221
you'll get some solution.

00:10:01.221 --> 00:10:03.330
You can check to see
whether your solution is

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:05.665
consistent with what
your intuition said.

00:10:05.665 --> 00:10:07.040
And if they disagree
it means you

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:10.290
have to update either your
intuition, or the solution,

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:11.610
or maybe both.

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:13.110
It's possible.

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:15.130
But at least one of
them has to be updated,

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:18.830
and that's a way of both getting
better scores on your exams,

00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:22.660
but also improving your
scientific intuition.

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:25.810
So, in particular, we just
want to do some limits.

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:33.040
We'll think in the
context, for example,

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:36.240
if the total concentration--
your adding of the small S--

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:38.150
if it goes to zero,
what we're going

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:43.570
to try to get intuition about
is this fraction of E-bound.

00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:44.590
It might be the enzyme.

00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:46.160
So the fraction of
this thing bound,

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:50.260
it's defined by the
concentration of the complex,

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.290
divided by the
concentration of the enzyme,

00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:56.490
plus the concentration of
the enzyme in the complex,

00:10:56.490 --> 00:11:00.360
assuming that this is the only
two places that the enzyme can

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:02.310
be located.

00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:09.890
Now, these three arrows, that,
in general, means a definition.

00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:13.070
So the question is,
if we come here,

00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:18.090
what happens to the fraction
of this enzyme that's bound?

00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:34.180
And, again, can't be
determined-- which

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:35.650
is different from don't know.

00:11:40.729 --> 00:11:42.770
And we're going to just
do a few different limits

00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:45.430
so we want to maybe go
through these quickly.

00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:47.990
I'll give you 10 seconds
to prepare your card.

00:11:58.460 --> 00:11:59.500
All right, ready?

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:01.315
Three, two, one.

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:10.300
So we're pretty good.

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:12.570
So I'd say a majority,
at least, of the group

00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:16.630
is saying that in this case, the
fraction bound should go to 0.

00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:18.974
Intuitively, why should that be?

00:12:18.974 --> 00:12:21.340
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:23.662
PROFESSOR: A little louder.

00:12:23.662 --> 00:12:25.120
AUDIENCE: You have
nothing to bind.

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.078
PROFESSOR: Yeah, right.

00:12:26.078 --> 00:12:30.120
So if there's no
S around at all,

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:33.130
then you shouldn't have
much of this complex, right?

00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:35.220
But you still have some enzymes.

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:38.750
This thing should go to 0,
and that kind of makes sense.

00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:46.470
And, similarly, if you add a
lot, a lot of this substrate?

00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:49.478
I'll give you eight seconds.

00:12:49.478 --> 00:12:52.160
AUDIENCE: So, you're moving
the substrate [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.900
PROFESSOR: Yes, so S
total, this is the total.

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:56.800
This is if you have
a test tube, and this

00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:03.040
is the amount of this sugar
that you add in there.

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:09.170
So S total, then, is
the sum of that and S.

00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:12.450
Do you need more time?

00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:12.950
Ready.

00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:16.640
Three, two, one.

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:21.760
So we have maybe an island
of people that disagree.

00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:28.070
At least a majority are
saying, in this case,

00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:31.120
it should have to go to 1.

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:35.454
Of course, this is
a limit and a limit.

00:13:35.454 --> 00:13:37.870
It's always going to be between
0 and 1, but in the limit,

00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:38.890
it does go to 1.

00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:41.560
So if you just add so
much of the substrate

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:44.240
then you should be able
to saturate that binding

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:47.210
and drive all of that
enzyme into the bound state.

00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:54.460
So this one is actually, maybe,
a little bit more subtle.

00:13:54.460 --> 00:14:02.627
So what if we take this limit?

00:14:02.627 --> 00:14:04.960
I'm going to give you 20
seconds to think about it, just

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:08.446
because it's roughly three
times as hard as the last one.

00:14:34.454 --> 00:14:35.370
Do you need more time?

00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:37.660
Or do you think that you have
something you believe in,

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:39.493
that you're willing to
turn to your neighbor

00:14:39.493 --> 00:14:41.990
and-- Let's see where we are.

00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:42.840
Ready.

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:44.445
Three, two, one.

00:14:47.426 --> 00:14:48.550
All right, so this is good.

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:54.170
So we have a fair
distribution, and this is one

00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:57.970
that reasonable people might
be able to argue about.

00:14:57.970 --> 00:15:00.890
It's worth having the argument.

00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:03.040
Give yourself 30 seconds,
turn your neighbor,

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:05.280
preferably a neighbor
that disagrees with you,

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:07.780
and tell them why you
said what you said.

00:16:08.890 --> 00:16:10.640
If in a pair, you've
already convinced

00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:12.890
each other of something,
then go ahead and look around

00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:15.000
to see if there's another
pair that has maybe

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.380
settled on a different answer.

00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:47.380
I think that you guys are still
kind of passionately arguing,

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:50.800
but maybe we'll go
ahead and convene,

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:55.379
and try to get a sense of--
I think, from the sound of it

00:16:55.379 --> 00:16:57.420
at least, there's some
disagreement about the way

00:16:57.420 --> 00:17:00.390
to think about this.

00:17:00.390 --> 00:17:01.890
In general, if you
want to volunteer

00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:04.780
an opinion or an explanation,
what I like to do is,

00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:08.440
I like to tell the group
what your neighbor thought.

00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:13.276
So go ahead, anybody, it
could be a neighbor in quotes.

00:17:13.276 --> 00:17:15.359
Anybody want to volunteer
one possible explanation

00:17:15.359 --> 00:17:18.109
of how to think about this?

00:17:18.109 --> 00:17:21.109
AUDIENCE: Well, what
my neighbors thought

00:17:21.109 --> 00:17:27.440
was if E total is
defined as E plus ES,

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:33.450
then as E total goes to 0,
then this goes to 0 over 0

00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:37.930
at some vague, unclear--

00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:39.700
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
although, right.

00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:41.750
So you're saying, maybe
it's all going to 0,

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:43.580
and then this is
just philosophy.

00:17:45.984 --> 00:17:48.150
Not that I'm putting words
in your neighbor's mouth.

00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:55.885
So there's a sense in which this
is true, but mathematically,

00:17:55.885 --> 00:17:59.630
and actually also physically,
there are well-defined ways

00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:01.430
of taking such a limit, right?

00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:05.350
So if you get 0 over 0, then
you can use L'Hopital's Rule,

00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:07.840
which we'll have the
opportunity to pull out sometime

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:08.710
within the class.

00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:10.395
Of course, the most difficult
part of L'Hopital's Rule

00:18:10.395 --> 00:18:11.760
is knowing how to spell it.

00:18:21.214 --> 00:18:23.130
So that's one answer,
the mathematical answer,

00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:25.860
that you should be able to just
take this limit and so forth.

00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:28.110
But I think there is another
physical answer, which is

00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:30.870
that this could happen, right?

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:36.206
And something is
going to occur, right?

00:18:36.206 --> 00:18:37.580
You could, in
principle, measure.

00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:39.980
And even if you just had
a single enzyme there,

00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:45.170
this Fb would be the fraction of
time that that enzyme is bound.

00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:49.820
So this is a well-defined
experimental question

00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:52.430
and the answer should arise
from these interactions.

00:18:56.150 --> 00:19:00.290
But then how do we edit
it-- what does it all mean?

00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:02.850
How do we figure out the answer?

00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:06.930
What's another
possible view on this?

00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:08.242
Maybe in the back.

00:19:08.242 --> 00:19:09.700
AUDIENCE: My neighbor
thought that,

00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:12.694
if there's a non-zero
concentration of S,

00:19:12.694 --> 00:19:15.480
and the concentration
of E goes to 0,

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:18.047
then all E will be bound
[? at some point ?].

00:19:18.047 --> 00:19:19.630
PROFESSOR: This is
interesting, right?

00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:22.800
So, if there's a finite
concentration of S,

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:24.870
if E goes to 0, then
you say well there's

00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:28.934
plenty of S to go around, so
I should always get bound.

00:19:28.934 --> 00:19:35.326
Is that what the neighbor--
that's another option.

00:19:35.326 --> 00:19:36.700
So, so far, we've
had an argument

00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:40.630
for can't be determined,
it's philosophy.

00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:44.800
We've had an argument for 1.

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:45.870
Other possibilities?

00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:49.694
This is an interesting
question, because depending

00:19:49.694 --> 00:19:51.860
on how you think about it,
you can convince yourself

00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:54.670
that it's anything, right?

00:19:54.670 --> 00:19:55.726
Other possible answers?

00:19:59.270 --> 00:20:00.695
No.

00:20:00.695 --> 00:20:02.595
AUDIENCE: So, I don't
hear the good answer.

00:20:05.868 --> 00:20:10.206
I said E because, when
there isn't very much E,

00:20:10.206 --> 00:20:19.035
then it's true that a lot of
people go into yes, but yeah.

00:20:19.035 --> 00:20:20.520
I don't know what to say.

00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:26.870
PROFESSOR: Now, that's OK.

00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:29.312
Another take on that
answer, or a different one?

00:20:29.312 --> 00:20:30.270
AUDIENCE: I don't know.

00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:31.644
If I had to complete
that answer,

00:20:31.644 --> 00:20:34.210
maybe something like,
but there still might not

00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:36.480
be a total large
concentration of either,

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:38.736
so there might still be
a decent chance for E

00:20:38.736 --> 00:20:41.434
to be around for a while
without encountering some of S.

00:20:41.434 --> 00:20:43.100
AUDIENCE 2: So the
forward reaction rate

00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:45.400
will also go to 0.

00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:47.650
Even though S is very large,
the forward reaction rate

00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:50.290
will also go to 0, as the
concentration [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:51.940
PROFESSOR: By the
forward rate, it's

00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:53.481
not necessarily a
variable. it's just

00:20:53.481 --> 00:20:56.197
that it depends on the substrate
concentration in this case.

00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:01.765
Other takes on it?

00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:08.810
This is interesting.

00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:12.750
So I'm going to argue that the
most reasonable way to view

00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:14.970
this would give you--
as long as there

00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:17.620
is some finite concentration
of that substrate around,

00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:20.840
and I think that there's a very
well-defined sense in which

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:24.170
it's going to go to
some finite fraction.

00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:26.990
And I think that when
you're thinking about this

00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:32.250
in the context of molecular
kinetics, the chemistry of you,

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:34.660
it still is all
well-defined, but the way

00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:37.130
that I think that I get the
most clear intuition is just

00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:41.480
to imagine myself as being that
one and only enzyme in the test

00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:42.870
tube.

00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:44.600
Now there's going to
be some rate that I

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:48.000
bind to the substrates, right?

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.910
And what's going to
determine that rate?

00:21:53.776 --> 00:21:55.740
AUDIENCE: The concentration
of the substrate?

00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:57.781
PROFESSOR: The concentration
of substrate, right.

00:21:57.781 --> 00:21:59.690
So if I double the
substrate concentration,

00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:02.690
what should that do to
the rate of me binding?

00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:03.875
It should double it, yeah.

00:22:03.875 --> 00:22:05.250
And then of course
there's always

00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:07.700
this Kf somewhere in there,
and some units, right?

00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:10.070
But there's going to be
some rate that I bind.

00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:11.550
And then when I bind again?

00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:14.180
Now I'm just an
enzyme substrate.

00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:16.739
Now, instead thinking about
this in the context of chemical

00:22:16.739 --> 00:22:18.280
kinetics, I can just
think about this

00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:20.920
from the standpoint of an
individual molecule, where

00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:24.080
I'm a complex, S-bound,
and there's some rate

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:25.680
that I fall apart.

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:27.640
And it's just the balance
of those two rates

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:30.050
of finding a substrate
and falling part

00:22:30.050 --> 00:22:32.430
that's going to lead
to this fraction bound.

00:22:35.150 --> 00:22:36.858
AUDIENCE: Taking what
you just explained,

00:22:36.858 --> 00:22:41.425
couldn't you think about it
as E always either 0 or 1,

00:22:41.425 --> 00:22:42.300
because when you're--

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:42.625
PROFESSOR: Yeah

00:22:42.625 --> 00:22:45.041
AUDIENCE: --in the case of
having one [? and the same-- ?]

00:22:45.041 --> 00:22:46.020
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:51.290
So, if you'd like, we could
put an average sign here,

00:22:51.290 --> 00:22:52.821
to say an average over time.

00:22:52.821 --> 00:22:55.320
Because in many, many cases,
what we're really interested in

00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:58.872
is the fraction of time that,
say, the promoter is bound,

00:22:58.872 --> 00:23:00.330
or the enzyme is
bound, or whatnot.

00:23:00.330 --> 00:23:04.550
And if you have many,
many, many molecules, then

00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:07.911
at any moment in time, the
average is the time average.

00:23:07.911 --> 00:23:09.660
But once you're down
to a single molecule,

00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:11.493
then you really want
to take a time average.

00:23:17.445 --> 00:23:20.967
We'll revisit this in just
a moment using the math,

00:23:20.967 --> 00:23:23.300
but what's interesting is the
math also can mislead you.

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:29.890
Other questions?

00:23:29.890 --> 00:23:32.582
If somebody wants
to argue forcefully

00:23:32.582 --> 00:23:34.040
what their neighbor
said was right,

00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:42.420
then I'm happy to-- we will come
back to this in a little bit.

00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:44.910
If I want to do the
fourth possibility, which

00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:47.697
is the total concentration
of the enzyme,

00:23:47.697 --> 00:23:48.905
it's going to go to infinity.

00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:55.270
I'll give you, again, eight
seconds to think and then

00:23:55.270 --> 00:23:56.860
get your card ready.

00:24:10.450 --> 00:24:12.380
Are you ready?

00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:13.870
Three, two, one.

00:24:16.461 --> 00:24:16.960
OK.

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:21.100
So we actually have a fair
amount of disagreement,

00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:25.260
between As and Bs it seems.

00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:27.890
Go ahead and, again,
turn to your neighbor,

00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:31.760
but maybe find somebody
that disagrees with you.

00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:33.565
Sometimes there are
pockets of people that

00:24:33.565 --> 00:24:34.690
agree one way or the other.

00:24:34.690 --> 00:24:38.140
So try to find each other.

00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:11.570
Yeah, I know.

00:25:11.570 --> 00:25:12.162
I understand.

00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:18.280
You can try to figure out the
expression for the fraction

00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:23.409
bound, and how that behaves.

00:25:23.409 --> 00:25:25.534
And that's actually kind
of weird as well, frankly.

00:25:32.450 --> 00:25:35.707
Why don't we go ahead and
reconvene, just so I can see.

00:25:35.707 --> 00:25:37.290
And maybe, let's go
ahead and re-vote,

00:25:37.290 --> 00:25:38.870
so I can see if
anybody convinced

00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:41.050
anybody of anything else.

00:25:41.050 --> 00:25:41.640
Ready.

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:44.570
Three, two, one.

00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:47.035
So it seems like now there's
pretty good agreement.

00:25:47.035 --> 00:25:48.410
The answer to this
is going to be

00:25:48.410 --> 00:25:52.880
A. There were a fair number
of people that said B before.

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:54.724
So here comes our curvy lines.

00:25:57.830 --> 00:26:00.890
And so the idea here
is that in the limit

00:26:00.890 --> 00:26:03.410
of the enzyme concentration
going to infinity,

00:26:03.410 --> 00:26:05.740
in that limit the fraction
bound has to go to 0,

00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:09.170
because you just don't
have any substrate to bind.

00:26:09.170 --> 00:26:12.016
And even if all the
substrate's bound-- and indeed

00:26:12.016 --> 00:26:13.890
in this limit, what
fraction of the substrate

00:26:13.890 --> 00:26:16.051
ends up being bound?

00:26:16.051 --> 00:26:17.110
AUDIENCE: All of it.

00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:19.090
PROFESSOR: All of it, right.

00:26:19.090 --> 00:26:20.760
So then, indeed,
the fraction bound

00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:21.780
is just going to be
the concentration

00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:24.279
of the substrate divided by the
concentration of the enzyme.

00:26:27.895 --> 00:26:29.270
In the limit of
the concentration

00:26:29.270 --> 00:26:31.353
of the enzyme going to
infinity, then the fraction

00:26:31.353 --> 00:26:33.470
of the enzyme bound
is going to go to 0.

00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:34.550
You're unhappy.

00:26:34.550 --> 00:26:38.090
AUDIENCE: I think having made
an extremely eloquent argument,

00:26:38.090 --> 00:26:42.560
number 3 for B, I actually
think that that answer is wrong.

00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:44.020
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:45.664
So this one, right?

00:26:45.664 --> 00:26:47.080
Yes, I mean, you
had convinced me.

00:26:51.450 --> 00:26:56.160
AUDIENCE: So if you take
E total to 0 at fixed S--

00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:57.160
PROFESSOR: Fixed S, yes.

00:26:57.160 --> 00:27:01.228
AUDIENCE: --then the
reaction rate is--

00:27:04.306 --> 00:27:06.722
PROFESSOR: You have to take
the limits carefully, I think.

00:27:06.722 --> 00:27:10.658
AUDIENCE: --is a ratio
of the forward propensity

00:27:10.658 --> 00:27:12.134
and the backwards propensity.

00:27:14.894 --> 00:27:15.560
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:27:18.242 --> 00:27:20.200
I think that the clearest
way to think about it

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:22.460
is as just that single enzyme.

00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:25.632
Because, it's certainly going
to have some rate of binding,

00:27:25.632 --> 00:27:27.090
and then once it's
bound it's going

00:27:27.090 --> 00:27:28.548
to have some rate
of falling apart.

00:27:30.565 --> 00:27:32.690
And that ratio is not a
function of whether there's

00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:35.230
one enzyme-- I mean, that
ratio is well-defined.

00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:40.890
The time average
of the probability

00:27:40.890 --> 00:27:42.710
of that enzyme being
bound is, indeed,

00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:43.710
a well-defined quantity.

00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:50.080
AUDIENCE: So can Ethan say
D and it depends on the Kd?

00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:54.270
PROFESSOR: Well, people
always like to argue Ds.

00:27:58.170 --> 00:28:00.590
We can write down what the
expression is, actually, now.

00:28:00.590 --> 00:28:05.560
And then you can decide whether
you think D is justified.

00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:07.310
We can also just
try to figure out,

00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:09.250
what's the equilibrium
of this thing?

00:28:09.250 --> 00:28:14.972
So the change in the
complex concentration

00:28:14.972 --> 00:28:16.430
as a function of
time is just going

00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:19.020
to be the rate of creation
minus the rate of destruction.

00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:21.640
So there's just going
to be this K forward,

00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:35.470
ES-- oh sorry, these
brackets are awful-- Kr, ES.

00:28:35.470 --> 00:28:37.320
And we just want to
set this equal to 0,

00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:40.950
if we want to figure out what
the equilibrium there is.

00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:46.840
And in one line, you can find
that the fraction bound can

00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:50.860
be written as a concentration
of the substrate here,

00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:56.996
divided by Kd, plus S. Is
this correct from standpoint

00:28:56.996 --> 00:28:57.495
of units?

00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:09.300
So there's something that
you might find troubling

00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:11.114
about this expression, though.

00:29:15.650 --> 00:29:17.090
Is anybody troubled by it?

00:29:19.850 --> 00:29:22.317
AUDIENCE: But it equals 0.

00:29:22.317 --> 00:29:24.275
PROFESSOR: You could say,
what if E total is 0?

00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:31.760
I'd say that if E total
is actually zero, now

00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:33.430
I think that's an
ill-defined quantity.

00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:36.620
So, at some point, I'll side
with the philosophers here.

00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:41.160
But if there is an enzyme to
talk about fraction bound,

00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:44.840
then-- So it's related
to this, but it's--

00:29:47.756 --> 00:29:52.032
AUDIENCE: But whenever you
have [INAUDIBLE] E [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:52.032 --> 00:29:52.740
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:55.730
So we've already discussed
from our intuition

00:29:55.730 --> 00:29:59.390
that as E total
goes to infinity,

00:29:59.390 --> 00:30:03.260
then the fraction bound
is supposed to go what?

00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:05.360
To 0, we decided, right?

00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:08.436
And does this
expression do that?

00:30:08.436 --> 00:30:10.266
AUDIENCE: Well this
is S, not S total.

00:30:10.266 --> 00:30:10.890
PROFESSOR: Yes!

00:30:10.890 --> 00:30:12.360
So this is S, not S total.

00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:16.940
And once again, really
easy to screw this up.

00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:22.790
Because, in many contexts, S
and S total are the same thing.

00:30:22.790 --> 00:30:24.850
Especially, in context
of enzyme kinetics,

00:30:24.850 --> 00:30:27.880
it's often the case that the
concentration enzyme is really

00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:30.680
rather low, and then the
substrate concentration

00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:33.630
is huge, so then S and
S total we can really

00:30:33.630 --> 00:30:37.090
treat as being interchangeable.

00:30:37.090 --> 00:30:41.100
But here, in the general
context, we can't.

00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:44.210
And this concentration
of S, this thing

00:30:44.210 --> 00:30:49.470
is a function of the
concentration of the enzyme.

00:30:49.470 --> 00:30:52.590
So this guy here,
it's a function

00:30:52.590 --> 00:30:56.100
of the total amount
of substrate you have

00:30:56.100 --> 00:31:00.695
and also E total, and
for that matter, Kd.

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:11.180
So really this thing
is a true statement,

00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:14.337
but it's very misleading
if you're not keeping track

00:31:14.337 --> 00:31:15.420
of what these things mean.

00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:19.594
Because, this thing is very
simple, except for that

00:31:19.594 --> 00:31:22.010
it's really actually complicated
because S section depends

00:31:22.010 --> 00:31:24.720
on everything right?

00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:26.220
Now there's one
context in which you

00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:29.470
can be safe in assuming that
S and S total are the same,

00:31:29.470 --> 00:31:32.540
and that's in the limit of, for
example, E total going to 0.

00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:38.080
So if you just have 1
enzyme, then this expression

00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:41.400
is, essentially, always valid.

00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:43.344
Every now and then,
you might be using up

00:31:43.344 --> 00:31:45.260
one of your substrate
molecules, occasionally.

00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:46.240
Right?

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:49.050
But it's pretty safe to say
that in the limit of E total

00:31:49.050 --> 00:31:51.600
going 0, when it's just in
the limit of one enzyme,

00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:54.130
then it's really just
described by a curve that

00:31:54.130 --> 00:31:56.110
looks like this.

00:31:56.110 --> 00:31:59.220
And this curve is something
that you see over, and over,

00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:02.080
and over again.

00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:03.720
And this is the
fundamental reason

00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:08.020
that Michaelis Menten kinetics
looks the way it does.

00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:10.390
But this is going to
be very useful for us

00:32:10.390 --> 00:32:13.770
because, in many contexts
that we're interested in,

00:32:13.770 --> 00:32:15.810
we want to think
about, for example,

00:32:15.810 --> 00:32:19.610
the rate expression
of some gene.

00:32:19.610 --> 00:32:22.180
And what we want to know
about is the fraction of time

00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:25.890
that it's going to be bound by,
say, a transcription factor.

00:32:25.890 --> 00:32:27.530
So then, in the
simplest case, we

00:32:27.530 --> 00:32:31.010
get an input-output relationship
that is just given by this.

00:32:31.010 --> 00:32:34.120
Because, there's just one,
or few copies, of that DNA,

00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:36.740
so it doesn't really sequester
the transcription factor

00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:37.990
that's going to be binding it.

00:32:43.810 --> 00:32:48.640
Do you guys understand
why this is weird?

00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:50.240
A thing you have
to be careful of?

00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:56.770
And more generally,
I strongly recommend

00:32:56.770 --> 00:32:59.390
that, in all of these
sorts of problems,

00:32:59.390 --> 00:33:02.884
it's good to just
plot some things.

00:33:02.884 --> 00:33:04.300
For example, the
fraction bound is

00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:08.850
a function of if you vary
the substrate concentration.

00:33:08.850 --> 00:33:12.420
Because, often you think that
you know what's going on,

00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:15.460
and then when you just go and
sit down to draw some curve,

00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:17.070
just get your
intuition, you realize

00:33:17.070 --> 00:33:18.860
you don't know where it starts,
you don't where it ends,

00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:20.630
you don't know what
it does in between.

00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:22.010
It's embarrassing,
but it's only when

00:33:22.010 --> 00:33:24.301
you sit down and try to do
something like that that you

00:33:24.301 --> 00:33:26.450
realize that it's not obvious.

00:33:26.450 --> 00:33:29.700
So just, for example, it's
useful to imagine a situation,

00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:32.280
just between a
similar E and S, where

00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:36.390
we, for the sake
of argument, say

00:33:36.390 --> 00:33:39.690
that S total is around this Kd.

00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:47.460
Now what we want to do is
ask, what's the fraction

00:33:47.460 --> 00:34:00.000
bound as a function of E total?

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.530
So we're going to
fix total substrate,

00:34:02.530 --> 00:34:05.555
vary the enzyme concentration.

00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:11.770
So we already know what
the limit here should be.

00:34:11.770 --> 00:34:13.560
We go to infinity,
what should this go to?

00:34:17.429 --> 00:34:18.651
0.

00:34:18.651 --> 00:34:20.400
We know that eventually
it should go to 0,

00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:24.360
and we already figured that
out for any finite substrate

00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:25.330
concentration.

00:34:25.330 --> 00:34:28.739
Incidentally, on
many of the exams,

00:34:28.739 --> 00:34:33.210
I will ask for plots
of curves like this.

00:34:33.210 --> 00:34:36.940
So basically you
want to indicate

00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:38.941
where it goes on one
end, where it starts--

00:34:38.941 --> 00:34:41.440
and where is it going to start
in the limit of E total going

00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:44.239
to 0?

00:34:44.239 --> 00:34:46.460
Half.

00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:50.489
Then it's actually
accurately described by that.

00:34:50.489 --> 00:34:51.250
So we start here.

00:34:51.250 --> 00:34:52.210
This is 1.

00:34:52.210 --> 00:34:55.199
So we start at 1/2.

00:34:55.199 --> 00:34:59.590
And it's going to have to go
in between those two, right?

00:34:59.590 --> 00:35:02.480
So what's the characteristic
concentration here

00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:05.360
where something-- where
it's changing a lot?

00:35:14.162 --> 00:35:15.107
AUDIENCE: Kd?

00:35:15.107 --> 00:35:15.940
PROFESSOR: Yeah, Kd.

00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:18.470
Kd's actually the only
concentration in the problem.

00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:20.260
So that means that's
what sets scale.

00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:22.340
And I don't know, Kd,
exactly where it should

00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:24.680
be, but something in there.

00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:26.980
So in these sorts
of situations, you

00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:30.910
want to get the limits and
what is it that sets the scale?

00:35:30.910 --> 00:35:32.960
If there's a peak,
is where is it?

00:35:37.390 --> 00:35:39.639
I encourage for a
few toy examples,

00:35:39.639 --> 00:35:40.930
just draw some of these things.

00:35:40.930 --> 00:35:45.460
It's a fun way to spend
a Saturday afternoon.

00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:49.215
Are there any questions
about what we've said so far?

00:35:49.215 --> 00:35:49.715
Yes.

00:35:49.715 --> 00:35:53.352
AUDIENCE: What's the Fb
when E total equals Kd?

00:35:53.352 --> 00:35:54.810
PROFESSOR: So the
question is, what

00:35:54.810 --> 00:35:57.790
is the fraction of the
enzyme that's bound

00:35:57.790 --> 00:36:03.270
when E total is equal to Kd?

00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:06.790
I think we could figure it
out, but it might actually

00:36:06.790 --> 00:36:09.770
be a little bit of math.

00:36:09.770 --> 00:36:10.270
Let me see.

00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:17.070
I would have to think
about it, but it's

00:36:17.070 --> 00:36:21.070
going to be around a third or
a fifth, somewhere in there.

00:36:24.117 --> 00:36:25.950
If somebody gets bored
with what I'm saying,

00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:27.590
they can do the calculation
and report to us

00:36:27.590 --> 00:36:28.423
at the end of class.

00:36:34.830 --> 00:36:41.120
So what we've just done,
it feels like a lot of time

00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:44.000
to spend on two molecules
binding to each other,

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.020
but I think that it's
good to just make sure

00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:48.629
that you're comfortable with
the simplest kind of process

00:36:48.629 --> 00:36:50.420
before you start thinking
about things that

00:36:50.420 --> 00:36:53.650
are super complicated, for
example, Michaelis Menten

00:36:53.650 --> 00:36:55.030
kinetics.

00:36:55.030 --> 00:36:57.380
So it's not super complicated.

00:36:57.380 --> 00:37:01.260
E plus S. So now it's
the same thing here,

00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:05.760
where we have K forward, K
reverse, to this complex.

00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:13.290
But here, at some rate,
Kcat, enzyme does something,

00:37:13.290 --> 00:37:15.710
turns it into a product.

00:37:15.710 --> 00:37:19.410
Now this is a model of
how an enzyme works.

00:37:19.410 --> 00:37:26.170
It is not a perfect description
of reality in any given case,

00:37:26.170 --> 00:37:27.740
or in general.

00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:30.560
What's the most obvious
possible point of concern?

00:37:34.402 --> 00:37:35.860
AUDIENCE: There's
no way to go back

00:37:35.860 --> 00:37:37.160
PROFESSOR: No way to go
back, well that's OK.

00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:38.368
What's that matter with that?

00:37:38.368 --> 00:37:39.870
AUDIENCE: Well,
sometimes there is.

00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:40.980
PROFESSOR: Well
sometimes there is.

00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:41.479
OK.

00:37:44.089 --> 00:37:45.630
I'd say the problem
is, in some ways,

00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:47.691
more fundamental than
just, sometimes there is.

00:37:47.691 --> 00:37:48.190
Right?

00:37:53.239 --> 00:37:55.530
It's true that sometimes--
but sometimes lots of things

00:37:55.530 --> 00:37:56.029
happen.

00:37:56.029 --> 00:38:01.430
Sometimes the enzyme
binds 2 substrates.

00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:03.660
On any specific case,
there are many ways

00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:08.050
that this thing can
fail, but there's

00:38:08.050 --> 00:38:10.285
a more fundamental sense
which is a problem.

00:38:10.285 --> 00:38:15.430
AUDIENCE: The rate at which it
produces the-- P doesn't depend

00:38:15.430 --> 00:38:17.020
on any other small molecules.

00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:18.520
It depends on other
concentrations--

00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:19.990
PROFESSOR: OK, right.

00:38:19.990 --> 00:38:22.124
So what Sam is saying
is, well this Kcat

00:38:22.124 --> 00:38:23.540
is not a function
of other things.

00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:25.359
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:38:25.359 --> 00:38:27.400
PROFESSOR: It's true, and
in many cases in might,

00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:37.200
but there's a real sense in
which this thing is failing

00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:39.140
fundamentally for any enzyme.

00:38:39.140 --> 00:38:41.848
And I just want to make
sure that we're all--

00:38:41.848 --> 00:38:43.560
AUDIENCE: Dissociation of P.

00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:45.370
PROFESSOR: Dissociation
of P, and what--

00:38:45.370 --> 00:38:47.320
AUDIENCE: From the enzyme.

00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:50.500
PROFESSOR: So, you don't
like the dissociation?

00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:52.374
AUDIENCE: We don't have
an association there.

00:38:52.374 --> 00:38:54.248
You're assuming that
the Kf of disocciation--

00:38:54.248 --> 00:38:55.940
PROFESSOR: Oh, right.

00:38:55.940 --> 00:39:00.690
Although, I could argue, Kcat
is some kind of bulk parameter

00:39:00.690 --> 00:39:03.340
that tells you about the
rate of breaking some bond

00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:04.570
and dissociating.

00:39:04.570 --> 00:39:08.150
And it's just a simple model.

00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:10.595
We don't want to
ask too much of it.

00:39:14.554 --> 00:39:16.842
AUDIENCE: K reverse is huge.

00:39:16.842 --> 00:39:18.050
PROFESSOR: K reverse is huge?

00:39:18.050 --> 00:39:19.841
Well, I haven't told
you what K reverse is.

00:39:19.841 --> 00:39:23.100
So, it's not huge.

00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:24.020
I mean, it could be.

00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:26.061
So far we haven't said
anything about what it is.

00:39:29.230 --> 00:39:32.540
What are the fundamental
properties of an enzyme?

00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:34.220
Or a catalyst, for that matter?

00:39:38.570 --> 00:39:40.460
When you go home
for Thanksgiving,

00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:44.030
your grandmother asks
you, honey, tell me,

00:39:44.030 --> 00:39:46.094
what's a catalyst?

00:39:46.094 --> 00:39:48.260
AUDIENCE: It's doesn't get
used during the reaction.

00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:48.710
PROFESSOR: What's that?

00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:50.310
AUDIENCE: It doesn't get
used up during the reaction.

00:39:50.310 --> 00:39:52.393
PROFESSOR: It doesn't get
used up in the reaction.

00:39:52.393 --> 00:39:55.110
OK, perfect, not used up.

00:39:55.110 --> 00:39:58.084
And does this
model violate that?

00:39:58.084 --> 00:39:58.890
AUDIENCE: No.

00:39:58.890 --> 00:40:00.630
PROFESSOR: So all right.

00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:01.500
Grandma's happy.

00:40:06.750 --> 00:40:10.145
AUDIENCE: You can deactivate
or activate these catalysts?

00:40:10.145 --> 00:40:11.610
I don't know.

00:40:11.610 --> 00:40:13.350
PROFESSOR: Right, so
it's true, there's

00:40:13.350 --> 00:40:15.230
some enzymes you can
activate, deactivate.

00:40:15.230 --> 00:40:20.702
How you deactivate a protein
enzyme, if you wanted to?

00:40:20.702 --> 00:40:21.670
AUDIENCE: Denature.

00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:24.600
PROFESSOR: You could denature
it from heat or salt.

00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:31.620
But that's maybe not one
of the most fundamental.

00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:34.766
AUDIENCE: You should have a rate
from S to P without the enzyme.

00:40:34.766 --> 00:40:37.140
PROFESSOR: Right so maybe
there should be a rate, S to P,

00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:39.230
without the enzyme.

00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:40.970
Although, I'm just
trying to tell you

00:40:40.970 --> 00:40:43.200
about the rate of what
the enzyme is doing,

00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:47.620
so you could write a
difference equation.

00:40:47.620 --> 00:40:51.132
If I just let this model go to
infinity, then what happens?

00:40:51.132 --> 00:40:52.980
AUDIENCE: You get P.

00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:55.800
PROFESSOR: You get P.
And how much P is it?

00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:56.340
A lot of P?

00:40:56.340 --> 00:40:57.090
A little bit of P?

00:40:57.090 --> 00:40:58.805
AUDIENCE: As much
as it can make.

00:40:58.805 --> 00:41:00.370
PROFESSOR: It's all pee.

00:41:00.370 --> 00:41:01.170
Right?

00:41:01.170 --> 00:41:03.390
And how much substrate?

00:41:03.390 --> 00:41:05.250
None, right?

00:41:05.250 --> 00:41:08.600
So if I just let this go, you
have 0 substrate, all product.

00:41:11.210 --> 00:41:11.990
Is that OK?

00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:18.160
I mean is that, in
general-- I like product.

00:41:23.490 --> 00:41:25.330
AUDIENCE: Time.

00:41:25.330 --> 00:41:26.661
PROFESSOR: Time?

00:41:26.661 --> 00:41:29.455
AUDIENCE: How much
time it would make too.

00:41:29.455 --> 00:41:30.830
PROFESSOR: Well,
we can calculate

00:41:30.830 --> 00:41:32.690
what the V is in this
model, and then we

00:41:32.690 --> 00:41:33.981
could figure out what the time.

00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:40.310
But there's something
wrong with that.

00:41:40.310 --> 00:41:42.880
And normally I wouldn't
want to belabor the point,

00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:45.105
but it's worth belaboring maybe.

00:41:45.105 --> 00:41:45.730
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:41:45.730 --> 00:41:48.705
If we had a back reaction,
then that wouldn't happen.

00:41:48.705 --> 00:41:50.330
PROFESSOR: Right,
OK, so this gets back

00:41:50.330 --> 00:41:52.490
to your back reaction, right?

00:41:52.490 --> 00:41:54.260
And I like the back rate.

00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:56.790
It's just there was
something a little more

00:41:56.790 --> 00:42:00.540
fundamental than the way you
phrased it, was my concern.

00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:04.250
Because what you said is,
there might be some back rate.

00:42:04.250 --> 00:42:05.020
Right?

00:42:05.020 --> 00:42:09.960
And I guess what I would say
is that there's kind of always

00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:13.850
some back rate, or that
the equilibrium-- this is

00:42:13.850 --> 00:42:17.160
fundamental-- the equilibrium
ratio between S and P,

00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:18.775
how does the enzyme change it?

00:42:18.775 --> 00:42:19.650
AUDIENCE: Not at all.

00:42:19.650 --> 00:42:21.510
PROFESSOR: It doesn't
change it, right?

00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:24.950
So if you take the
enzyme, invertase,

00:42:24.950 --> 00:42:28.050
and you put it in a
test tube with sucrose,

00:42:28.050 --> 00:42:32.040
it's going to break down almost
all that sucrose, really fast.

00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:36.530
It's going to speed things up
by a factor of 10 to the 5,

00:42:36.530 --> 00:42:38.690
or I don't know, by a lot.

00:42:38.690 --> 00:42:42.869
But if you leave the
test tube for a year,

00:42:42.869 --> 00:42:44.660
it comes to an equilibrium
with the enzyme.

00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:47.490
If you left it in the test
you without the enzyme

00:42:47.490 --> 00:42:52.010
for a million years, you
would get to the same outcome.

00:42:52.010 --> 00:42:55.605
You come to some equilibrium
between the substrate

00:42:55.605 --> 00:42:56.630
and the product.

00:42:56.630 --> 00:43:00.200
And that's a function
of the kinetics.

00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:03.215
There's a delta G and so
forth, but the important point

00:43:03.215 --> 00:43:06.210
is that the enzyme does not
change that equilibrium.

00:43:08.739 --> 00:43:10.114
AUDIENCE: I just
have a question.

00:43:10.114 --> 00:43:13.042
This molecule is
effectively [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:13.042 --> 00:43:15.482
If you leave it in a test
tube for a million years,

00:43:15.482 --> 00:43:16.950
then the ATP will
all be consumed.

00:43:16.950 --> 00:43:18.300
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:20.268
AUDIENCE: But if
you keep providing

00:43:20.268 --> 00:43:22.649
ATP, then you should--

00:43:22.649 --> 00:43:24.940
PROFESSOR: Well, first of
all, not all enzymes actually

00:43:24.940 --> 00:43:26.005
are coupled to ATP.

00:43:26.005 --> 00:43:29.560
So ATP is a way of putting
out a big delta G, right?

00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:33.180
So that you can really
push things far.

00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:36.340
And ATP could, in principle,
be included as a co-factor,

00:43:36.340 --> 00:43:38.670
and then you take the
overall delta G of that,

00:43:38.670 --> 00:43:40.380
and then calculate it.

00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:41.985
But if you want
to keep on adding,

00:43:41.985 --> 00:43:43.110
then it complicates things.

00:43:43.110 --> 00:43:44.545
But I think, for many enzymes,
it's more straightforward

00:43:44.545 --> 00:43:46.900
just to think about
enzymes that don't require

00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:48.530
any extra input of energy.

00:43:48.530 --> 00:43:50.390
So they're just lowering
the energy barrier

00:43:50.390 --> 00:43:52.740
and they're just speeding
up the rate of reaction.

00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:53.900
But the important point
there is that they're

00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:55.020
speeding up both rates.

00:43:57.960 --> 00:44:01.670
So the equilibrium between those
two is not going to change.

00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:05.550
And that's why, this
thing, it's a great model,

00:44:05.550 --> 00:44:08.290
but like all models
you have to make

00:44:08.290 --> 00:44:11.680
sure you keep track of what the
assumptions are going into it.

00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:14.659
Because this is going to
violate the laws of physics

00:44:14.659 --> 00:44:16.200
if you take this
model too seriously.

00:44:18.971 --> 00:44:21.429
AUDIENCE: I don't understand
what the fundamental principle

00:44:21.429 --> 00:44:22.674
that's being violated is.

00:44:22.674 --> 00:44:26.160
Because why is it not that
if you have it stable,

00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:29.148
everything is product.

00:44:29.148 --> 00:44:31.140
You never see as in nature.

00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:34.973
I mean, how is that not
a physical situation?

00:44:34.973 --> 00:44:37.014
AUDIENCE 2: So if you can
get a really small test

00:44:37.014 --> 00:44:41.365
tube with one G and one
S, isn't it just like--

00:44:41.365 --> 00:44:42.740
PROFESSOR: But
the same statement

00:44:42.740 --> 00:44:44.260
that we talked about
for single, then

00:44:44.260 --> 00:44:46.490
you would want-- if you had
just a single substrate going

00:44:46.490 --> 00:44:48.281
to product-- then you
want to look probably

00:44:48.281 --> 00:44:49.290
at the time average.

00:44:49.290 --> 00:44:53.100
Because, the thing is that
the equilibrium is determined

00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:57.280
by the delta G of the reaction.

00:44:57.280 --> 00:45:00.670
And that's going to determine
the equilibrium, whether you

00:45:00.670 --> 00:45:05.380
have the enzyme there or not.

00:45:05.380 --> 00:45:08.960
So if the delta G
is such that it's

00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:12.110
at equilibrium--
sort of 90% product,

00:45:12.110 --> 00:45:14.812
10% substrate-- then
what you can do is go,

00:45:14.812 --> 00:45:16.520
well if you start out
with all substrate,

00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:18.240
this model may work wonderfully.

00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:20.490
But then as you're getting
closer to that equilibrium,

00:45:20.490 --> 00:45:22.281
then this model's going
to be breaking down

00:45:22.281 --> 00:45:23.930
because this model
is not accounting

00:45:23.930 --> 00:45:26.780
for the back reaction,
as you were saying.

00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:29.990
But I just want to stress that
it's not just a detailed model,

00:45:29.990 --> 00:45:32.124
or it's not just a
failure for some enzymes,

00:45:32.124 --> 00:45:33.540
this is the way
that enzymes work.

00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:39.536
Are there other
questions about this?

00:45:39.536 --> 00:45:41.160
Or different ways of
thinking about it?

00:45:44.375 --> 00:45:45.250
So, it's not used up.

00:45:45.250 --> 00:45:51.990
It speeds up reaction
in both directions.

00:46:03.655 --> 00:46:05.738
AUDIENCE: I mean, but
that's not necessarily true.

00:46:05.738 --> 00:46:07.702
You can have an
enzyme that is only

00:46:07.702 --> 00:46:11.160
really capable of
going in one direction.

00:46:11.160 --> 00:46:12.140
PROFESSOR: Really?

00:46:12.140 --> 00:46:15.510
We should meet after class
and you can give me your--

00:46:15.510 --> 00:46:18.456
AUDIENCE: It basically binds
in a particular direction.

00:46:18.456 --> 00:46:19.830
PROFESSOR: It's
just not allowed.

00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:28.744
So it's true that
enzymes can be--

00:46:28.744 --> 00:46:31.410
and this is getting to the other
fundamental point of an enzyme,

00:46:31.410 --> 00:46:35.090
which is that they,
especially enzymes in biology,

00:46:35.090 --> 00:46:39.690
can be exquisitely specific.

00:46:39.690 --> 00:46:43.420
What you're saying
is that it's really

00:46:43.420 --> 00:46:46.010
only catalyzing this
one, weird reaction,

00:46:46.010 --> 00:46:50.380
going from some funny substrate
to some funny product, right?

00:46:50.380 --> 00:46:55.360
But that enzyme also speeds
up that back reaction,

00:46:55.360 --> 00:46:59.590
going from the funny product
to the funny substrate.

00:46:59.590 --> 00:47:04.560
And that's just like
the nature of the beast.

00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:09.140
I'm try to think of what I can--

00:47:09.140 --> 00:47:11.575
AUDIENCE: That's where you
have one enzyme going one way,

00:47:11.575 --> 00:47:15.900
and another going the
other way in biology.

00:47:15.900 --> 00:47:17.510
PROFESSOR: So it
does happen there,

00:47:17.510 --> 00:47:20.400
but then what they
are often doing

00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:24.670
is they're coupling things to
ATP hydrolysis or something,

00:47:24.670 --> 00:47:31.240
in order to actually make that
reaction go in the single way.

00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:34.440
Just as kind of like a general
statement-- because the way

00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:40.010
these things work is that
there's some over here

00:47:40.010 --> 00:47:43.080
and it's over here
somehow, and these enzymes,

00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:46.236
they just lower
this energy barrier.

00:47:46.236 --> 00:47:47.736
AUDIENCE: So the
thing that confused

00:47:47.736 --> 00:47:49.950
me at first is that I was
just thinking of rates,

00:47:49.950 --> 00:47:52.019
and I think the thing
that's important

00:47:52.019 --> 00:47:55.931
is to just realize again that
the enzyme doesn't change

00:47:55.931 --> 00:47:59.090
the thermodynamics, it
only changes that variable

00:47:59.090 --> 00:48:00.180
to change where they are.

00:48:00.180 --> 00:48:02.600
So the key thing
is that it doesn't

00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:06.071
change the ratio of the
product through the substrate,

00:48:06.071 --> 00:48:08.020
the rates are realatively--

00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:10.580
PROFESSOR: Right, because from
a thermodynamic standpoint,

00:48:10.580 --> 00:48:13.350
it's not used up, which
means there's an enzyme here

00:48:13.350 --> 00:48:15.230
and an enzyme here.

00:48:15.230 --> 00:48:17.840
So these final states,
you can think about only

00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:19.620
in terms of the substrate
and the product,

00:48:19.620 --> 00:48:23.582
because the enzyme was there
in both beginning and ending.

00:48:23.582 --> 00:48:25.040
So from a thermodynamic
standpoint,

00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:26.980
it's just you're not
allowed to change

00:48:26.980 --> 00:48:28.413
one rate without the other.

00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:42.970
Now in the reading, you saw
the Michaelis Menten kinetics,

00:48:42.970 --> 00:48:48.980
where you found
that once you reach

00:48:48.980 --> 00:48:52.510
this equilibrium between the
enzyme substrate complex,

00:48:52.510 --> 00:48:54.330
the velocity can be
described by something

00:48:54.330 --> 00:48:57.140
that is rather simple.

00:48:57.140 --> 00:49:03.820
There's some Km plus S,
and then there's some Vmax.

00:49:06.500 --> 00:49:08.940
And if the substrate
concentration,

00:49:08.940 --> 00:49:10.540
the total concentration
is very large,

00:49:10.540 --> 00:49:14.810
then you can just think
about this is the S total.

00:49:14.810 --> 00:49:18.520
Now in this case,
this, once again,

00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:21.450
can be thought of in this limit
of if the enzyme concentration

00:49:21.450 --> 00:49:23.950
is really small, then this
is really just the fraction

00:49:23.950 --> 00:49:25.350
of the enzyme that's bound.

00:49:29.825 --> 00:49:31.700
So we've already spent
a lot of time thinking

00:49:31.700 --> 00:49:36.830
about how to get at
the fraction bound,

00:49:36.830 --> 00:49:42.670
and the question is, what
should this Km be here?

00:49:42.670 --> 00:49:45.000
Now that I've told you that
it's the fraction bound,

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:49.480
is it just going to be the
same thing that we had before?

00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:51.020
Is the Km the same
thing is the Kd?

00:49:55.490 --> 00:50:00.075
So remember, before, we found
that Kd was just Kr over Kf.

00:50:03.710 --> 00:50:07.770
But you should, in principle,
be able ti just look at that

00:50:07.770 --> 00:50:10.420
and say what fraction
bound should be.

00:50:13.294 --> 00:50:16.647
AUDIENCE: Is it Kr over Kf
plus-- other way around,

00:50:16.647 --> 00:50:19.050
Kr plus Kcat over Kf

00:50:19.050 --> 00:50:21.475
PROFESSOR: Yes, because
now, from the standpoint

00:50:21.475 --> 00:50:27.330
of the enzyme, there's some rate
at which you form the complex.

00:50:27.330 --> 00:50:29.650
And now the lifetime
of that complex

00:50:29.650 --> 00:50:31.496
has been reduced,
because now there

00:50:31.496 --> 00:50:33.790
are two ways for the complex
to fall apart, right?

00:50:33.790 --> 00:50:36.680
One, is could just go
back where it came from,

00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:40.200
but the other is that you
can catalyze the reaction.

00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:43.350
So, from the standpoint of the
enzyme and the fraction bound,

00:50:43.350 --> 00:50:45.330
then we can just--
the entire discussion

00:50:45.330 --> 00:50:47.130
that we had before--
we can just replace Kd

00:50:47.130 --> 00:50:51.680
with this new
Michaelis constant, Km.

00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:56.130
Where now, we say now it's the
Kr up in the numerator still,

00:50:56.130 --> 00:50:58.810
but now, instead of just
being Kf at the bottom,

00:50:58.810 --> 00:51:00.760
we have to add Kcat,
because there are just

00:51:00.760 --> 00:51:04.510
two ways that that
enzyme substrate

00:51:04.510 --> 00:51:06.430
complex can fall apart.

00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:15.354
Oh I'm sorry, I've
already messed up.

00:51:18.258 --> 00:51:26.815
Kf over-- So Kcat
has to be with Kr.

00:51:36.490 --> 00:51:39.265
So it just kind of speeds up the
effective rate of dissociation.

00:51:42.730 --> 00:51:46.300
And of course, depending
whether Kcat is large or small

00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:50.860
as compared to Kr, this can be
either a large or small effect.

00:51:50.860 --> 00:51:55.100
But these rates, they just add.

00:51:55.100 --> 00:51:58.630
And we'll spend a lot of time
thinking about how rates add

00:51:58.630 --> 00:52:02.259
and so forth in a few weeks.

00:52:02.259 --> 00:52:04.008
AUDIENCE: For this
expression to be valid,

00:52:04.008 --> 00:52:06.664
don't you need Kcat to be much
longer than the other rates?

00:52:06.664 --> 00:52:07.580
PROFESSOR: Right, yes.

00:52:07.580 --> 00:52:10.485
So you want Kcat
to be-- So there's

00:52:10.485 --> 00:52:13.110
various kinds of limits in which
you can talk about this thing.

00:52:13.110 --> 00:52:15.600
So in general, what you
want is Kcat to be small,

00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:19.652
and you also want the initial
transient to have gone away.

00:52:19.652 --> 00:52:21.360
Because when you first
add the substrate,

00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:24.290
you don't yet have any
enzyme substrate complex.

00:52:24.290 --> 00:52:26.460
So you have to wait
until you've gotten

00:52:26.460 --> 00:52:30.454
to this so-called steady state,
where the Michaelis Menten

00:52:30.454 --> 00:52:31.120
formula applies.

00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:33.150
And then you also
can't have let it

00:52:33.150 --> 00:52:34.890
go too far, because
then of course you're

00:52:34.890 --> 00:52:36.556
going to start running
out of substrate.

00:52:49.326 --> 00:52:51.200
In the homework, you're
going to get a chance

00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:53.366
to play with Michaelis
Menten kinetics a little bit,

00:52:53.366 --> 00:52:56.420
and think about the
dynamics when you have

00:52:56.420 --> 00:52:58.270
different kinds of inhibitors.

00:52:58.270 --> 00:53:02.320
So you can imagine having
inhibitors that inhibit

00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:03.390
multiple different ways.

00:53:03.390 --> 00:53:08.270
You could have an inhibitor
the binds the enzyme,

00:53:08.270 --> 00:53:12.230
and prevents the enzyme from
providing the substrate.

00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:13.875
Now should this effect the Vmax?

00:53:21.802 --> 00:53:23.260
We'll think about
it for 10 seconds

00:53:23.260 --> 00:53:28.050
and we'll vote because
it's so much fun.

00:53:28.050 --> 00:53:29.760
We have these cards.

00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:35.930
Vmax change-- and this
is with an inhibitor

00:53:35.930 --> 00:53:41.650
that binds here-- and forming
an EI complex, reversibly.

00:53:41.650 --> 00:53:43.655
The question is,
does Vmax change?

00:53:55.020 --> 00:53:58.560
A is yes and B is no.

00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:06.630
I'll give you 10 seconds
to think about this.

00:54:06.630 --> 00:54:12.570
So Vmax is, again, defined as
this rate of product formation

00:54:12.570 --> 00:54:15.370
at saturation, when you
have a lot of the substrate.

00:54:34.460 --> 00:54:36.290
Do you need time?

00:54:36.290 --> 00:54:39.489
Or will time help?

00:54:39.489 --> 00:54:40.530
Well who wants more time?

00:54:40.530 --> 00:54:41.821
Just nod if you want more time.

00:54:45.260 --> 00:54:46.930
OK, well let's see how we feel.

00:54:46.930 --> 00:54:48.820
Let's go ahead and vote.

00:54:48.820 --> 00:54:53.510
If I add this
competitive inhibitor,

00:54:53.510 --> 00:54:55.640
the question is,
will be Vmax change?

00:54:55.640 --> 00:54:56.300
Ready.

00:54:56.300 --> 00:54:59.930
Three, two, one.

00:54:59.930 --> 00:55:04.830
So we have a majority
of Bs, but some As.

00:55:04.830 --> 00:55:07.570
Can somebody give the intuition
for why the Vmax should not

00:55:07.570 --> 00:55:08.070
change?

00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:12.156
Yes.

00:55:12.156 --> 00:55:18.108
AUDIENCE: Vmax is
when substrate is

00:55:18.108 --> 00:55:21.580
far excess to the enzyme
and, at that time,

00:55:21.580 --> 00:55:25.260
all of the enzymes bond to the
substrate not to the inhibitor.

00:55:25.260 --> 00:55:26.260
PROFESSOR: Right, right.

00:55:26.260 --> 00:55:30.415
So Vmax occurs when you have
lots and lots of substrate.

00:55:30.415 --> 00:55:31.790
And, of course,
the condition you

00:55:31.790 --> 00:55:33.170
have to be a little bit
careful, because it's not just

00:55:33.170 --> 00:55:35.120
having more substrate
than the enzyme,

00:55:35.120 --> 00:55:38.490
but it's when the
substrate is saturating.

00:55:38.490 --> 00:55:40.470
So if you have lots
and lots of substrate,

00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:42.210
then the important
point there is

00:55:42.210 --> 00:55:45.436
that it's when you've
pushed this reaction all

00:55:45.436 --> 00:55:49.414
the way over here, all
the enzyme is bound,

00:55:49.414 --> 00:55:51.580
and that's when you get
this maximal rate of product

00:55:51.580 --> 00:55:52.680
formation.

00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:55.328
And that's true, you might
need more substrate in order

00:55:55.328 --> 00:55:57.036
to get all that enzyme
bound, because you

00:55:57.036 --> 00:56:00.870
have to pull the enzyme away
from this side reaction.

00:56:00.870 --> 00:56:03.330
And, indeed, this
kind of inhibitor

00:56:03.330 --> 00:56:07.820
alters the Km, the effect
of Km of the reaction.

00:56:07.820 --> 00:56:13.380
But it does not
affect this Vmax,

00:56:13.380 --> 00:56:18.300
whereas other inhibitors
can bind this complex

00:56:18.300 --> 00:56:22.300
and prevent it from
catalyzing the reaction.

00:56:22.300 --> 00:56:26.800
And that will instead affect
Vmax, but won't affect Km.

00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:30.340
So this was a powerful
way that enzymologists

00:56:30.340 --> 00:56:34.020
have used to try to get at
mechanism of inhibitors.

00:56:34.020 --> 00:56:35.550
So if you have
some small molecule

00:56:35.550 --> 00:56:38.309
you know somehow inhibits
some enzymatic reaction

00:56:38.309 --> 00:56:40.100
and you want to know,
how is it doing that?

00:56:40.100 --> 00:56:43.630
One thing you can do is you
can titrate in that inhibitor

00:56:43.630 --> 00:56:47.130
and then measure
the Michaelis Menten

00:56:47.130 --> 00:56:50.520
curve to get out the
Vmax and Km to try

00:56:50.520 --> 00:56:52.820
to get a sense mechanism.

00:56:52.820 --> 00:56:55.340
And I always say we should
be drawing these things.

00:56:55.340 --> 00:56:58.240
So V is a function
of-- and this is

00:56:58.240 --> 00:56:59.950
in the [? lit ?] for
a lot of substrate

00:56:59.950 --> 00:57:02.780
relative to the enzyme--
then we can indeed

00:57:02.780 --> 00:57:10.620
say it's going to plateau
in Vmax at concentration Km.

00:57:10.620 --> 00:57:11.150
It's at 1/2.

00:57:15.580 --> 00:57:17.040
And then it plateaus.

00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:20.390
This is a very, very,
very common curve.

00:57:20.390 --> 00:57:26.090
Lots of things in biology and
life start at 0 and plateau,

00:57:26.090 --> 00:57:28.455
and there are almost only
two ways you can do that.

00:57:28.455 --> 00:57:29.830
OK, there are more
than two ways,

00:57:29.830 --> 00:57:32.880
but there are a very small
number of ways you can do that.

00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:33.919
This is one of them.

00:57:38.050 --> 00:57:42.480
Any questions on these Michaelis
and Menten kinetics inhibitors?

00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:46.990
You're going to spend a couple
hours over the next few days

00:57:46.990 --> 00:57:48.270
thinking about this.

00:57:54.720 --> 00:57:57.190
So what I want to do
for the last 20 minutes

00:57:57.190 --> 00:57:59.250
is switch gears a
little bit and to think

00:57:59.250 --> 00:58:03.757
about the simple dynamics
of gene expression.

00:58:03.757 --> 00:58:05.590
The ideas that we've
just been talking about

00:58:05.590 --> 00:58:10.915
end up being just very relevant
for the simple models here.

00:58:10.915 --> 00:58:13.040
So what we want to think
about is a situation where

00:58:13.040 --> 00:58:18.740
we have some transcription
factor, X, that is activating

00:58:18.740 --> 00:58:26.930
expression of gene Y. So we
have X activating Y. Now,

00:58:26.930 --> 00:58:28.810
the way we can think
about this, for example,

00:58:28.810 --> 00:58:34.350
is that we may have X,
which together with some

00:58:34.350 --> 00:58:42.530
signal S of X, turns
into some X star

00:58:42.530 --> 00:58:48.150
It's X star that can
bind to the promoter

00:58:48.150 --> 00:58:59.360
and lead to expression of Y.

00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:02.040
Now in Uri's book, he
talks about this idea

00:59:02.040 --> 00:59:04.160
of a separation of
time scales that

00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:08.360
is often useful to invoke when
thinking about gene expression.

00:59:08.360 --> 00:59:11.860
In this context, what
was the fast event?

00:59:17.527 --> 00:59:18.610
AUDIENCE: Activation of X?

00:59:18.610 --> 00:59:21.360
PROFESSOR: Activation
of X. So in many cases,

00:59:21.360 --> 00:59:26.730
if this is a sugar or a small
molecule that is going to be,

00:59:26.730 --> 00:59:31.150
in this case, activating X, that
can occur really quite quickly.

00:59:31.150 --> 00:59:34.180
Often maybe less than a second.

00:59:34.180 --> 00:59:36.900
The rate-limiting step
would then, in many cases,

00:59:36.900 --> 00:59:38.980
be getting the signal
into the cell, so

00:59:38.980 --> 00:59:42.450
depending on how that works.

00:59:42.450 --> 00:59:45.680
So this occurs very rapidly.

00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:49.160
What that means is if
we look at a signal Sx,

00:59:49.160 --> 00:59:53.790
as a function of time, where
it starts out being absent

00:59:53.790 --> 00:59:58.430
and then, all of a sudden, sugar
appears in the environment,

00:59:58.430 --> 01:00:02.100
we can think about the
concentration of X and X star

01:00:02.100 --> 01:00:09.400
So X starts out high and then
quickly goes down, right?

01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:16.270
Whereas X star will do the
reverse here, quickly comes up.

01:00:16.270 --> 01:00:17.345
And this should be flat.

01:00:20.090 --> 01:00:23.180
Now, what is it that Y will
do as a function of time?

01:00:27.050 --> 01:00:31.360
So if X is an activator that
means that before X star became

01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:36.500
available, there was
no expression of Y.

01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:37.490
So it should be low.

01:00:42.130 --> 01:00:44.550
So X is quickly activated,
turns into X star.

01:00:44.550 --> 01:00:52.171
So we start expressing
Y. So, roughly,

01:00:52.171 --> 01:00:53.462
what does this curve look like?

01:01:03.100 --> 01:01:05.666
Somebody please help me.

01:01:05.666 --> 01:01:08.155
AUDIENCE: It's S-shaped.

01:01:08.155 --> 01:01:09.780
PROFESSOR: OK, so it
could be S-shaped.

01:01:15.590 --> 01:01:18.420
The thing that's very
fast is activation of X,

01:01:18.420 --> 01:01:21.570
and then what's really
still rather fast

01:01:21.570 --> 01:01:24.450
is equilibration of X
star on this promoter.

01:01:24.450 --> 01:01:27.270
So that might
still be very rapid

01:01:27.270 --> 01:01:31.610
because these things were
nearly instantaneous, But.

01:01:31.610 --> 01:01:34.590
Coming to equilibrium here
still might happen over

01:01:34.590 --> 01:01:37.580
time scales of seconds.

01:01:37.580 --> 01:01:39.730
So that means that you
actually, sort of quickly,

01:01:39.730 --> 01:01:43.710
start getting expression,
at least on time scales

01:01:43.710 --> 01:01:46.180
are relevant in terms of
hours kind of time scales.

01:01:46.180 --> 01:01:48.750
Of course, it still does
take time to express.

01:01:48.750 --> 01:01:54.950
So it takes minutes for the
RNA polymerase to transcribe,

01:01:54.950 --> 01:01:56.720
and then of course
the ribosome's

01:01:56.720 --> 01:01:57.970
going to have to do something.

01:02:04.024 --> 01:02:04.940
What do I want to ask?

01:02:09.530 --> 01:02:11.500
Let's write down the
equation that Uri

01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:15.569
invokes because there's a
very real sense in which it

01:02:15.569 --> 01:02:17.360
does, maybe, look a
little bit more S-like.

01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:21.010
But at least in terms of
Uri's kind of formalism,

01:02:21.010 --> 01:02:23.510
he often would say, the
change in the concentration

01:02:23.510 --> 01:02:28.260
of this protein, it's going
to be some function of,

01:02:28.260 --> 01:02:29.510
in this case X star.

01:02:32.590 --> 01:02:35.740
And then there's another term
here, which was the minus alpha

01:02:35.740 --> 01:02:39.714
Y. What was the
minus alpha Y due to?

01:02:39.714 --> 01:02:40.630
AUDIENCE: Degradation.

01:02:40.630 --> 01:02:43.210
PROFESSOR: Right, so
there are two terms.

01:02:43.210 --> 01:02:47.150
So there's alpha, and it's going
to be the sum of two things.

01:02:47.150 --> 01:02:51.060
There's alpha due
to degradation.

01:02:51.060 --> 01:02:55.230
So if the protein is degraded
actively in some way.

01:02:55.230 --> 01:02:56.960
If the protein is
not degraded, then

01:02:56.960 --> 01:02:59.940
does that mean that
alpha is equal to 0?

01:02:59.940 --> 01:03:00.750
No.

01:03:00.750 --> 01:03:04.504
So what is this other term?

01:03:04.504 --> 01:03:05.420
AUDIENCE: Cell growth.

01:03:05.420 --> 01:03:07.544
PROFESSOR: Right, so it's
alpha due to some growth.

01:03:07.544 --> 01:03:13.800
And cell growth leads
to some dilution effect.

01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:16.260
So if you have the same
number of proteins in the cell

01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:17.760
that the cell is
growing, that means

01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:19.240
the concentration is shrinking.

01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:19.780
Right?

01:03:19.780 --> 01:03:22.210
Now the reality
of this process is

01:03:22.210 --> 01:03:26.380
that it's complicated, because
cell growth is not uniform.

01:03:26.380 --> 01:03:29.610
But if you kind of
average over things,

01:03:29.610 --> 01:03:32.230
then a reasonable
description is just to say,

01:03:32.230 --> 01:03:35.540
just a first order
effective dilution rate.

01:03:35.540 --> 01:03:41.960
If you want to, you can write
down a more detailed formula,

01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:44.900
or a model where, you say
if cell growth does this,

01:03:44.900 --> 01:03:47.164
then-- It's going to kind
of wiggle a little bit

01:03:47.164 --> 01:03:48.580
over the course
of the cell cycle,

01:03:48.580 --> 01:03:50.860
but this is a
reasonable description.

01:03:50.860 --> 01:03:55.700
Now what this is saying
is that even if there

01:03:55.700 --> 01:03:57.550
is no active degradation,
then there still

01:03:57.550 --> 01:04:00.760
is an effective term
due to this dilution.

01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:05.610
And this means that if
we immediately activate,

01:04:05.610 --> 01:04:09.070
and if F of X star-- at time
T equal to 0 here-- if it just

01:04:09.070 --> 01:04:12.880
goes to some beta, then
what is the long time

01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:13.990
solution of this equation?

01:04:17.750 --> 01:04:18.700
AUDIENCE: Beta/alpha.

01:04:18.700 --> 01:04:19.970
PROFESSOR: Beta/alpha, right?

01:04:19.970 --> 01:04:23.140
So we know it should
eventually come to beta/alpha.

01:04:27.538 --> 01:04:29.912
What's the characteristic time
scale for it to get there?

01:04:36.716 --> 01:04:40.582
AUDIENCE: Cell alpha's
rate, it's 1/alpha.

01:04:40.582 --> 01:04:41.290
PROFESSOR: Right.

01:04:41.290 --> 01:04:44.141
So characteristic
time is 1/alpha.

01:04:44.141 --> 01:04:45.890
The solution to this
differential equation

01:04:45.890 --> 01:04:53.850
is just an exponential where,
if extend this line here,

01:04:53.850 --> 01:04:56.580
this is 1/alpha.

01:04:56.580 --> 01:04:58.120
So that's time.

01:04:58.120 --> 01:05:00.060
And then, of course,
the T 1/2, the time

01:05:00.060 --> 01:05:03.340
it takes to get to 1/2, is
indeed different by log 2,

01:05:03.340 --> 01:05:04.877
and that's the
cell division time.

01:05:10.330 --> 01:05:17.220
This point here-- this is
at T 1/2-- is cell division.

01:05:17.220 --> 01:05:21.155
This is for a stable protein,
assuming that alpha degradation

01:05:21.155 --> 01:05:21.738
is equal to 0.

01:05:25.950 --> 01:05:29.150
So the thing to remember is
that this basic differential

01:05:29.150 --> 01:05:34.450
equation of Y dot is equal
to a minus alpha Y, is

01:05:34.450 --> 01:05:37.264
an exponential by going to 0.

01:05:37.264 --> 01:05:39.180
Whereas if you have a
constant term here, then

01:05:39.180 --> 01:05:41.180
it's an exponential going
to some nonzero value.

01:05:43.750 --> 01:05:49.990
So, indeed, if the
signal here goes away,

01:05:49.990 --> 01:05:52.250
then we quickly come back here.

01:05:52.250 --> 01:05:53.755
So this comes here.

01:05:53.755 --> 01:05:59.620
This comes here, and then this--
does it go back down to 0?

01:05:59.620 --> 01:06:02.840
Is it more or less
rapid returning to 0

01:06:02.840 --> 01:06:04.810
than it took to come up?

01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:09.820
All right.

01:06:09.820 --> 01:06:10.320
OK.

01:06:15.860 --> 01:06:17.585
So, how can I phrase this?

01:06:20.570 --> 01:06:27.330
OK, faster decay, question mark.

01:06:27.330 --> 01:06:32.840
A is yes, and B is
no, and you can always

01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:35.500
do C or something if you
don't know what I'm asking.

01:06:35.500 --> 01:06:40.460
The question is, we've
turned off the signal,

01:06:40.460 --> 01:06:43.580
is it going to go away faster,
or slower, or the same?

01:06:47.830 --> 01:06:48.455
This is faster.

01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:54.530
B can even be slower maybe.

01:06:54.530 --> 01:06:55.175
C is same.

01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:01.900
Do you understand
the options now?

01:07:01.900 --> 01:07:06.734
So we stopped expressing
Y, so concentration of X

01:07:06.734 --> 01:07:07.900
is going to decrease, right?

01:07:07.900 --> 01:07:12.110
Question is, it is going
to go away faster, slower,

01:07:12.110 --> 01:07:15.310
or the same as the
rate that it came up?

01:07:20.330 --> 01:07:23.150
Do you need more time?

01:07:23.150 --> 01:07:23.980
Ready.

01:07:23.980 --> 01:07:26.060
Three, two, one.

01:07:30.100 --> 01:07:35.000
OK so we have a fair
agreement that, this thing,

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:36.140
it's going to be the same.

01:07:36.140 --> 01:07:38.550
So there's a characteristic
time for it to come

01:07:38.550 --> 01:07:45.350
and it's the same characteristic
time for it to degrade away.

01:07:45.350 --> 01:07:51.570
So this, I would say,
is not a priori obvious,

01:07:51.570 --> 01:07:55.450
but it's really just
the nature of when you

01:07:55.450 --> 01:07:58.122
have these sorts of situations.

01:07:58.122 --> 01:07:59.580
This sets the time
scale for if you

01:07:59.580 --> 01:08:01.650
want to change the
concentration-- doesn't matter

01:08:01.650 --> 01:08:03.441
whether you're going
to 0, a finite number,

01:08:03.441 --> 01:08:05.630
or if you go from high
to low, but not 0.

01:08:05.630 --> 01:08:07.796
Again, it's going to be
exponential in the same time

01:08:07.796 --> 01:08:09.930
scale.

01:08:09.930 --> 01:08:12.722
So if you want
that to be faster,

01:08:12.722 --> 01:08:14.680
if you want to be able
to respond more rapidly,

01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:21.420
then one solution would be to
actively degrade the protein.

01:08:21.420 --> 01:08:21.970
Right?

01:08:21.970 --> 01:08:25.500
Now it's obvious that
degrading the protein actively

01:08:25.500 --> 01:08:28.470
will allow it to go
way more rapidly.

01:08:28.470 --> 01:08:30.700
What's perhaps less
obvious is that there's

01:08:30.700 --> 01:08:34.229
a real sense in which
degrading the protein allows

01:08:34.229 --> 01:08:37.930
this response to be
more rapid as well.

01:08:37.930 --> 01:08:42.440
But of course, did we
keep everything constant?

01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:44.502
If I say, oh I want the
curve to look like this,

01:08:44.502 --> 01:08:46.210
can I just increase
the degradation rate?

01:08:49.472 --> 01:08:52.279
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:08:52.279 --> 01:08:55.500
PROFESSOR: Well let's say
that X star is already maximal

01:08:55.500 --> 01:08:56.380
saturating.

01:08:56.380 --> 01:08:59.193
So we're already-- well, OK.

01:08:59.193 --> 01:08:59.859
So I understand.

01:08:59.859 --> 01:09:02.630
OK, now I understand
what you're saying.

01:09:02.630 --> 01:09:04.630
You need to increase beta,
and that could either

01:09:04.630 --> 01:09:06.609
be by increasing
X star or it could

01:09:06.609 --> 01:09:11.060
be just by increasing the
strength of that promoter.

01:09:11.060 --> 01:09:15.039
So the idea is that if you
want a more rapid on or off,

01:09:15.039 --> 01:09:16.830
you can also increase
the degradation rate.

01:09:16.830 --> 01:09:18.640
But there's a cost
to that, which

01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:22.109
is that you have to
make more protein.

01:09:22.109 --> 01:09:27.640
And, indeed, many transcription
factors are actively degraded.

01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:31.520
And that may be because if you
are using these transcription

01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:33.069
factors to turn
things on and off,

01:09:33.069 --> 01:09:37.350
then you want to
get rapid responses.

01:09:37.350 --> 01:09:39.560
And, also, transcription
factors are often not

01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:42.314
expressed at the same high
levels as structural proteins.

01:09:42.314 --> 01:09:44.189
So that means that the
cost of degrading them

01:09:44.189 --> 01:09:46.450
is not going to be as severe.

01:09:46.450 --> 01:09:52.024
If you're actively degrading
cell wall type of things,

01:09:52.024 --> 01:09:53.399
that's going to
be really costly.

01:09:56.175 --> 01:09:57.550
Are there any
questions of what I

01:09:57.550 --> 01:09:59.790
mean by this discussion
of active degradation,

01:09:59.790 --> 01:10:03.370
why it might help, costs?

01:10:03.370 --> 01:10:05.540
Because, over the
next week or two,

01:10:05.540 --> 01:10:08.560
we're going to see
multiple possible solutions

01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:09.320
to this problem.

01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:12.260
If you want to increase
the rate that you respond

01:10:12.260 --> 01:10:14.490
to some environmental
change, one way you can do it

01:10:14.490 --> 01:10:17.824
is by actively degrading some
of the signaling proteins.

01:10:17.824 --> 01:10:20.240
But there are other solutions
we're going to come up with,

01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:21.240
such as auto regulation.

01:10:29.167 --> 01:10:30.750
In the last few
minutes here, I wanted

01:10:30.750 --> 01:10:36.240
to say something about this
question of ultrasensitivity.

01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:37.660
So there are many
cases where you

01:10:37.660 --> 01:10:43.350
would like to get very
sensitive responses, i.e.

01:10:43.350 --> 01:10:45.570
you'd like to be able
to make a modest change

01:10:45.570 --> 01:10:48.080
in the concentration of some,
for example, transcription

01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:51.965
factor, and get a significant
change in-- I don't know why

01:10:51.965 --> 01:10:55.272
I erased that but--
and you want to be

01:10:55.272 --> 01:10:58.370
able to get a significant
change in the output.

01:10:58.370 --> 01:11:00.050
And one way that
you can do this is

01:11:00.050 --> 01:11:02.490
by having some sort of
cooperative binding.

01:11:02.490 --> 01:11:05.070
If you have dimerization
of a transcription factor

01:11:05.070 --> 01:11:06.930
before binding then
you, for example,

01:11:06.930 --> 01:11:09.470
can get a more
sensitive response.

01:11:09.470 --> 01:11:14.760
So one way to think that this
is if you have an X activating Y

01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:21.280
right in this simple
case, then the rate

01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:27.440
of Y expression
as a function of--

01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:30.680
and here we're going
to write X for now

01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:35.500
and we'll just assume that
all Xs are indeed active.

01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:37.380
OK?

01:11:37.380 --> 01:11:39.910
Now if it just is a
single X binding Y,

01:11:39.910 --> 01:11:43.580
then this should behave just
like this Michaelis Menten

01:11:43.580 --> 01:11:46.280
formula, where there's some
maximal rate of expression

01:11:46.280 --> 01:11:47.730
here.

01:11:47.730 --> 01:11:54.100
There's going to be some Kd,
which is bound 1/2 the time,

01:11:54.100 --> 01:11:56.454
and then some curve
that looks like this.

01:11:56.454 --> 01:11:58.120
So this would be an
example of something

01:11:58.120 --> 01:12:01.310
that is not ultrasensitive
and that you

01:12:01.310 --> 01:12:06.350
don't get a significant change
in the rate of Y expression--

01:12:06.350 --> 01:12:12.500
or the equilibrium Y
value, if you'd like--

01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:15.110
as a function of changing X.

01:12:15.110 --> 01:12:17.212
As you start having
more and more X,

01:12:17.212 --> 01:12:18.670
you would need get
more and more Y,

01:12:18.670 --> 01:12:23.080
but that ratio, if you
double X, you always

01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:29.260
get less than a doubling
of Y. So the question is,

01:12:29.260 --> 01:12:33.230
what can you do to make
things somehow more sensitive?

01:12:33.230 --> 01:12:37.580
You'd like something that
looks a little bit more--

01:12:37.580 --> 01:12:44.160
well the ultimate would
be 0 and then beta.

01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:49.170
And indeed this would be
this logic kind of limit.

01:12:49.170 --> 01:12:53.380
So this is Y expression
as a function of X.

01:12:53.380 --> 01:12:56.760
If you didn't get any until some
Kd and then all of a sudden you

01:12:56.760 --> 01:12:59.880
had beta, that would be
as sensitive as you could

01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:02.550
possibly-- this is
ultra-, ultra- sensitive.

01:13:06.450 --> 01:13:09.164
So there's one solution that
was talked about in the book

01:13:09.164 --> 01:13:11.330
to get something that's a
little bit more like this.

01:13:14.460 --> 01:13:15.710
AUDIENCE: Cooperative binding.

01:13:15.710 --> 01:13:17.251
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
cooperative binding.

01:13:17.251 --> 01:13:23.700
So we often describe
these functions--

01:13:23.700 --> 01:13:26.080
this is the rate of expression
as a function of X--

01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:28.420
as via some hill equation.

01:13:28.420 --> 01:13:30.580
So I'm just going
to write Xs here.

01:13:30.580 --> 01:13:37.720
So it could be there's
X, K plus X here.

01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:41.180
Now if you have
cooperative binding

01:13:41.180 --> 01:13:43.560
either at the side of the
promoter or dimerization,

01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:45.950
trimerzation, something
before binding,

01:13:45.950 --> 01:13:49.810
you can get some effective
hill coverage in here,

01:13:49.810 --> 01:13:52.516
where this is going to be
up X to the n, X to the n, K

01:13:52.516 --> 01:13:53.240
to then.

01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:55.965
We put K to n here just so
that all the units are still

01:13:55.965 --> 01:13:58.260
reasonable.

01:13:58.260 --> 01:14:01.920
And as n increases, this thing
becomes more and more sensitive

01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:03.220
or ultrasensitive.

01:14:03.220 --> 01:14:05.950
So this is with n
just equal to 1,

01:14:05.950 --> 01:14:09.430
just a monomer binding
in a simple way.

01:14:09.430 --> 01:14:11.150
Kd is still the 1/2 mark.

01:14:11.150 --> 01:14:15.590
So things always cross
here, but if it's 2

01:14:15.590 --> 01:14:20.610
then it might look like
this, now three, four.

01:14:20.610 --> 01:14:24.121
So it gets steeper and steeper
as that hill coefficient

01:14:24.121 --> 01:14:24.620
increases.

01:14:34.090 --> 01:14:38.065
As Uri mentions, for many input
in many genes, if you go in

01:14:38.065 --> 01:14:39.690
and you measure these
things, you often

01:14:39.690 --> 01:14:42.265
get something that's reasonably
well-defined by the S

01:14:42.265 --> 01:14:45.060
with a n somewhere
between 1 and 4.

01:14:45.060 --> 01:14:47.251
So things are often
moderately cooperative.

01:14:57.020 --> 01:15:00.120
Maybe I'll just tell you
about this other mechanism

01:15:00.120 --> 01:15:04.620
for ultrasensitivity, this
idea of molecular titration.

01:15:04.620 --> 01:15:08.010
I'm going to leave you with the
basic model, or the basic idea,

01:15:08.010 --> 01:15:10.820
and then at the beginning
of class on Thursday,

01:15:10.820 --> 01:15:12.390
we will try to
figure out what are

01:15:12.390 --> 01:15:15.227
the requirements for the
various binding affinities

01:15:15.227 --> 01:15:16.560
in order for that model to work.

01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:24.460
So what's neat
about this is it's

01:15:24.460 --> 01:15:26.440
a situation where
you can get something

01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:29.705
that is ultrasensitive
without any cooperativity.

01:15:33.950 --> 01:15:40.530
The idea is that you have
some X that is indeed

01:15:40.530 --> 01:15:46.250
binding to the promoter to
activate expression of Y,

01:15:46.250 --> 01:15:51.720
but, in addition, you have
some other protein, say W,

01:15:51.720 --> 01:15:58.535
that can bind to X and turn
it into this complex XW.

01:16:01.710 --> 01:16:06.580
So we can always describe
things as there's some Kw here,

01:16:06.580 --> 01:16:11.900
some Kd for X to
bind to the promoter,

01:16:11.900 --> 01:16:20.960
and for some relations
of Kw, Kd, and W

01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:24.450
total, you can get
ultrasensitivity.

01:16:24.450 --> 01:16:28.810
What happens is that if you look
at this rate of expression--

01:16:28.810 --> 01:16:34.250
so this is Y expression--
as a function of X,

01:16:34.250 --> 01:16:39.260
if you don't have any W here,
then indeed it just looks

01:16:39.260 --> 01:16:40.540
like our standard thing here.

01:16:43.290 --> 01:16:47.960
Whereas in the this
is when you add W,

01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:51.790
when you add this molecular
titration phenomenon,

01:16:51.790 --> 01:16:54.710
you can make this curve
slide over so you don't

01:16:54.710 --> 01:16:59.310
get significant
expression until X--

01:16:59.310 --> 01:17:00.790
or this is X total
if you'd like--

01:17:00.790 --> 01:17:03.974
is larger than W total and this
whole curve just slides over.

01:17:09.170 --> 01:17:12.367
You can see this
is ultrasensitive.

01:17:12.367 --> 01:17:14.200
So nothing happens until
all of a sudden you

01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:16.280
start getting expression.

01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:18.530
So what we're going to do
is on the beginning of class

01:17:18.530 --> 01:17:21.330
on Thursday, we'll
try to figure out

01:17:21.330 --> 01:17:26.390
what is the relationship
between these different binding

01:17:26.390 --> 01:17:30.240
parameters in order to get
something that looks like this.

01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:36.910
Are there any questions
about anything

01:17:36.910 --> 01:17:38.527
that we've said so far today?

01:17:42.350 --> 01:17:45.180
With that, why don't
we go ahead and quit.
