00:00:20.285 --> 00:00:21.910
PROFESSOR: Today what
we're going to do

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.078
is we're going to talk about
some of the big ideas in class.

00:00:34.042 --> 00:00:36.775
Today what we're going to do
is talk about pattern formation

00:00:36.775 --> 00:00:39.220
in biology, some of the
different mechanisms

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.010
that are employed in development
and other contexts in order

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.130
for organisms to figure
out where to put things.

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.110
Now before I get
into that too much,

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.330
I wanted to make couple
administrative type

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:52.830
announcements.

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.090
So first, we have
graded the exams

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.440
and we'll hand them back
at the end of class today.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.850
If I try to forget then
please somebody remind me.

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.391
What we're going to
do is we're going

00:01:02.391 --> 00:01:05.736
to start by just talking
about diffusion a bit more.

00:01:05.736 --> 00:01:07.110
I think that
there's a fair range

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.490
of different maybe experiences
thinking about diffusion

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:11.770
and what it can do for you.

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.090
So we'll work on our
intuition a little bit.

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.370
And then I'll say
something about the reading

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.810
that you did from
[INAUDIBLE] book

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.010
about robust mechanisms
for pattern formation

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.650
in the context of development.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.943
So simple diffusion
with degradation leads

00:01:25.943 --> 00:01:28.650
to these exponential
profiles that are not

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.470
robust to changes in the
concentration or production

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.690
rate of the morphogen.
Whereas if you have self

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.940
enhanced degradation then
this leads to power law

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.350
fall off it's more robust
to the concentration

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.660
of this morphogen.

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.640
Then what we're going to do
is transition to these turning

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.640
patterns, reaction
to fusion systems

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.620
where you can have a
really surprising effect,

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.670
whereby in a well mixed
situation these chemicals

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.220
or proteins or reactants,
they might just

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.800
reach a stable state.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.100
However, once you add
diffusion, then you

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.120
can start getting
pattern formation, which

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.690
is a very funny thing because
diffusion is normally something

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.485
that's smooths out profiles.

00:02:14.485 --> 00:02:15.860
Normally we think
about diffusion

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.260
as being something
that removes patterns

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.210
and indeed that's
generally what happens.

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:23.360
But following from
this class of work

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.970
from Alan Turing at
the end of his life,

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.430
he showed that it's
actually in principle

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.780
possible to have the emergence
of patterns from diffusion.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.720
And we'll talk about some of
the ways that could possibly

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:35.220
happen.

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.510
So Turing patterns are already
a surprising case where

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.140
diffusion leads to patterns.

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.860
There's another
interesting phenomenon

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.850
where if you add another
source of noise that-- again,

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.940
you think noise, demographic
noise, the random creation

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.260
destruction of individuals
or chemicals or proteins.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.245
Normally, we think this
should also kind of be

00:02:58.245 --> 00:02:59.980
a force for removing patterns.

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.520
But there's been
a number of pieces

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.920
of work over the last decade
showing that in some cases,

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.880
demographic noise
can actually lead

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.210
to patterns either
in space or in time.

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:12.990
We're going to talk
more about this

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.380
in the context of these
so-called noise induced

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:16.810
predator-prey oscillations.

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.890
But since we're
talking about patterns

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.785
here I will tell you something
about how such noise can

00:03:22.785 --> 00:03:24.830
enhance the
formations of patterns

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.340
in the context of
the Turing mechanism.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.020
And then we'll end by talking
some about recent work of how

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:36.250
E. coli find the center of their
cell when they want to divide.

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.609
So you can imagine this
is not an obvious thing

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:40.900
to figure out how you might do.

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.751
And we'll talk about
the so-called Min system

00:03:44.751 --> 00:03:46.750
that E. coli use to find
the center of the cells

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.395
so they know where
to septate, where

00:03:48.395 --> 00:03:49.915
to cut off and make two cells.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.750
So I just want to
start by making sure

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.456
that when we talk
about diffusion,

00:03:58.456 --> 00:04:00.080
we're all talking
about the same thing.

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.072
Now, hopefully for
those of you that

00:04:07.072 --> 00:04:09.405
have not been thinking about
diffusion so much recently,

00:04:09.405 --> 00:04:12.420
you did read the notes that
Alexander Van Oudenaarden

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.550
put together for Systems
Biology a few years ago.

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:20.950
I think it's useful, but
in addition to the math,

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:24.300
as maybe many of you
know I'm a huge fan

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.760
of graphical
representations of ideas.

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.940
So I just want to
make sure that we all

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.900
agree on some of the basic
ideas of how, for example, we

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.240
get flux in the
context of diffusion.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.350
So imagine that we
have a one dimension

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:49.270
system where there's some
chemical with concentration c.

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:55.720
We can imagine, for example, it
starts out looking like this.

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.690
This is a concentration profile
as a function of position

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:05.880
x where we have maybe
a box of length l.

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.800
Concentration of some chemicals
of function of position

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.715
x in some space.

00:05:17.715 --> 00:05:20.340
Now I just want to make
sure that we're all

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:21.590
thinking about the same thing.

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:23.340
So it starts out some
concentration of c1,

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.600
over might be some c2.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.670
Linearly here.

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:29.350
I just want to make
sure we all agree

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:36.060
on the magnitude of the flux
at some different points.

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:47.650
So, in particular, we can think
about A, B, this is capital C.

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:50.360
So where is the magnitude
of the flux largest?

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:08.130
A, B, C. D corresponds
to them being the same.

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:10.170
E as don't know.

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:14.680
Are there any questions
about the question?

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:15.180
Yes.

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:17.530
AUDIENCE: On the y-axis,
you're plotting concentration?

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:19.320
PROFESSOR: Yes, this
y-axis is the concentration

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:20.570
is the function of position x.

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:29.614
All right, I'll give another
five seconds to think about it.

00:06:36.175 --> 00:06:37.550
All right, do you
need more time?

00:06:40.461 --> 00:06:40.960
Let's vote.

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:44.770
Ready three, two, one.

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:46.530
OK, great.

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:48.800
So I'd say a vast
majority here are agreeing

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:54.250
that it's going to D. The
flux is going to the same

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:56.080
everywhere.

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.110
Now the flux-- can
somebody remind us?

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:01.995
We'll say the flux of J.
And what is it going to be?

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:15.720
So there's a minus D times the
change in c with respect to x.

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.170
This was derived in the notes.

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:21.990
So this is highlighting
that what leads to a flux

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:26.880
is the change in a concentration
with respect to position.

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.790
And so it doesn't matter that
the concentration is higher

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:32.310
here than here, we
have the same flux.

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:34.610
And the flux is in
which direction?

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:36.170
Left, right, up, down?

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:37.880
Three, two, one.

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:40.170
Left, so the flux is here.

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:52.400
Minus sign-- like always, it's
hard to remember from equations

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:54.230
whether they're plus
minus signs but you

00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:56.680
should be able to just
remember you can draw something

00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:00.900
like this and say OK,
this is a positive DCDX,

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:04.495
so flux is going to be in the
negative direction, right?

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:16.260
Now, what will be the change in
the concentration with respect

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.940
to time at this point right now?

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:25.110
So this is change in the
conservation at point

00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:28.100
b with respect to time.

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:33.390
Is it greater than
0, equal to 0,

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:37.110
less than 0, or can't determine?

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:51.830
Does everybody understand the
question I'm trying to ask?

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:53.360
Change in the
concentration at this

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:58.112
point with respect to time,
at this time that's wrong.

00:08:58.112 --> 00:08:59.400
I'll give you 5 seconds.

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:09.050
Ready?

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:13.890
Three, two, one.

00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:15.580
OK.

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:22.370
And so this, again, it's
pretty good but not everyone.

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:23.420
So it is going to be b.

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:27.301
Can somebody explain
why it's b here?

00:09:27.301 --> 00:09:27.800
Yes.

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:29.892
AUDIENCE: There's as
much flux coming in

00:09:29.892 --> 00:09:31.520
as coming out on the other side?

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:32.520
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:36.689
So it's true that there's a net
flux here coming to the left.

00:09:36.689 --> 00:09:38.980
But from the sample, if we
want to know whether there's

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:42.270
a change in the
concentration at that point,

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:45.150
we need to know what's the
net number of particles moving

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:47.990
to the left verses the net
particle number there that

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:51.730
are coming in from the right.

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:56.740
Now of course, on this left
face-- if I draw a little box

00:09:56.740 --> 00:10:02.092
here-- are all the particles
crossing this position?

00:10:02.092 --> 00:10:03.425
Are they all moving to the left?

00:10:09.161 --> 00:10:09.660
No.

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:16.450
So the idea is that all the
particle motion is random.

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:18.600
And indeed, there's
only a slight access

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.975
of particles moving to the
left as compared to the right.

00:10:20.975 --> 00:10:23.584
In the sense that, if you look
at the concentration there,

00:10:23.584 --> 00:10:25.000
the concentration
is rather large,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.970
it's only a little
bit larger to right

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:28.450
than to the left of this plane.

00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:30.480
Which means that there's only
a slight excess of particles

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:32.313
defusing to the left
as coming to the right,

00:10:32.313 --> 00:10:35.862
but that leads to a net
flux of particles crossing

00:10:35.862 --> 00:10:36.820
this plane to the left.

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:50.280
So where will the
concentration be changing?

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:52.206
At this point here
will the concentration

00:10:52.206 --> 00:10:53.580
be changing with
respect to time?

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:56.120
Ready three, two, one.

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:57.490
No.

00:10:57.490 --> 00:11:03.980
So well does it change at all
ever anywhere in this example?

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:05.730
Is this a steady state
profile, yes or no?

00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:07.329
Ready three, two, one.

00:11:07.329 --> 00:11:07.870
AUDIENCE: No.

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:09.430
PROFESSOR: No.

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:11.695
What should be the
steady state profile?

00:11:11.695 --> 00:11:12.320
AUDIENCE: Flat.

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:13.700
PROFESSOR: Flat, OK.

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:16.330
So how does that come about
if the concentration is not

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:18.210
changing any?

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:19.190
Yeah.

00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:21.260
AUDIENCE: It'll only
change at the edges.

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.343
PROFESSOR: It's only
changing the edges initially.

00:11:25.454 --> 00:11:27.720
Now, it's important
to note that it's not

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:31.230
that the concentration
profile is not going

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:34.680
to start looking like this.

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:37.633
So that will not actually
be how it-- eventually it's

00:11:37.633 --> 00:11:38.800
going to be flat.

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:42.020
But it's going to
smooth out on the edges.

00:11:44.794 --> 00:11:46.710
Do you guys understand
what I'm trying to say?

00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:49.080
It's not that it's a line
that kind of goes like this,

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:51.520
but instead we do end
up getting curvature.

00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:56.430
One more of these,
and then we'll

00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:59.540
consider ourselves to
be expert diffusionists.

00:12:01.477 --> 00:12:03.185
All right, so let's
say the concentration

00:12:03.185 --> 00:12:05.525
as a function of position
looks something like this.

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:18.210
What I want to know is,
where is DCDT maximal?

00:12:26.931 --> 00:12:28.180
We have some different points.

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:42.920
We have A, B, C,
D. Five seconds.

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:54.040
Ready three, two, one.

00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:01.920
All right, so we finally
got a lot of disagreement.

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:03.860
I like it.

00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:05.550
Turn to your
neighbor, you should

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:08.626
be able to find somebody
that disagrees with you.

00:13:08.626 --> 00:13:09.750
What is it that determines?

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:12.240
AUDIENCE: [ALL DISCUSSING]

00:13:58.675 --> 00:14:00.550
PROFESSOR: All right,
did you guys all agree?

00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:10.262
You all agree on it?

00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:15.420
OK let's go ahead and reconvene.

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:18.150
And let me see, maybe
they were forming

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:19.610
the domains of some sort.

00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:21.330
All right, ready.

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:22.430
Wait, he says, no, no.

00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:26.570
All right, OK, one question.

00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:31.784
AUDIENCE: Is this
instantaneous in some sense?

00:14:31.784 --> 00:14:32.450
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:34.609
AUDIENCE: Exactly at the inset.

00:14:34.609 --> 00:14:36.650
PROFESSOR: All right, so
I guess what I would say

00:14:36.650 --> 00:14:39.830
is that this is
concentration profile

00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:43.790
at some time as a function
of position in time.

00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:47.010
If you want to know the
concentration profile

00:14:47.010 --> 00:14:48.900
some time delta t later, right?

00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:54.190
t plus delta t.

00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:56.860
Well then, it's going to
be the concentration we

00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:59.530
had before then a little bit.

00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:05.460
Plus delta t times the
derivative with respect

00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:08.130
to time.

00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:12.780
Right, so this is the
concentrate file at this time.

00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:15.370
And I want to how
much is it going

00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:16.910
to change in the next delta t?

00:15:22.982 --> 00:15:24.690
And I'm assuming, of
course, that I'm not

00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:26.822
adding any particles or
taking any particles away.

00:15:26.822 --> 00:15:28.240
So just do the diffusion.

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:29.656
All right, let's
see where we are.

00:15:29.656 --> 00:15:33.120
Ready three, two, one.

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:34.080
OK.

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:37.540
All right so it's we got
domain, definitely some domains.

00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:38.040
All right.

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:42.676
Well, it's going
to end up being A,

00:15:42.676 --> 00:15:46.730
as I think the majority of
the group is now saying.

00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:50.625
And why is it a?

00:15:50.625 --> 00:15:52.500
AUDIENCE: Because of
the second derivative.

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:54.000
PROFESSOR: Second
derivative, right?

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.550
So just what we
said before is that,

00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:58.955
if we wanted to know the
change of concentration

00:15:58.955 --> 00:16:01.900
with respect of time, at
this point that was zero.

00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:08.930
Because the flux particle was
leading that point and the flux

00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:09.930
coming in were the same.

00:16:15.147 --> 00:16:17.230
And we can also think about
the second derivative.

00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:19.640
So this indeed just
from fix, like I said,

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:26.550
was first law/ we got a D, so
this gives second derivative c

00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:28.532
with respect to x squared.

00:16:28.532 --> 00:16:29.115
So that's a 2.

00:16:31.645 --> 00:16:35.180
What this is saying is that,
to determine how rapidly

00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:39.360
this concentration is going to
change at a particular point

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:41.132
with respect of
time, we need to know

00:16:41.132 --> 00:16:43.090
the curvature of the
concentration with respect

00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:45.530
to position.

00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:47.950
So many people
were saying c here.

00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:51.660
And actually, this is
where the concentration

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:56.420
will remain exactly constant
over this next delta t.

00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:57.861
And of course, if
we want to know

00:16:57.861 --> 00:17:00.360
about what the concentration
is going to do for a long time,

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:01.950
then we have to do
something more subtle.

00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:03.700
But if we want to how
the concentration is

00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:08.730
changing right now, then we
just look at the curvature.

00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:11.139
And indeed, the curvature
here is maximal.

00:17:14.599 --> 00:17:18.131
So concentration
DCDT at this point,

00:17:18.131 --> 00:17:19.839
is it going to be
greater or less than 0?

00:17:19.839 --> 00:17:22.770
Ready three, two, one.

00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:24.770
PROFESSOR: Less than 0, right?

00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:28.413
Now, it's true that only the
curvature at a particular point

00:17:28.413 --> 00:17:31.760
and matter is to know how the
concentrations going to change

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:33.191
over this next delta t.

00:17:33.191 --> 00:17:34.690
But if you want to
know about what's

00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:36.150
going to happen over
longer periods of time,

00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:38.566
than you have to worry about
more of the global structure.

00:17:38.566 --> 00:17:42.650
And what's true is that this
local maximum may quickly

00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:44.374
go away.

00:17:44.374 --> 00:17:46.790
So you don't have to wait very
long before this thing gets

00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:53.590
smooth and then DCDT will--
the magnitude will go to 0.

00:17:53.590 --> 00:18:00.810
And sometimes this big hump
will stick around longer,

00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:02.940
but because of the
curvature, this

00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:06.830
has the maximal
magnitude of DCDT.

00:18:10.972 --> 00:18:12.680
And it makes sense
that the concentration

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:15.680
is going to go down because the
net flux here is to the right

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:16.635
and to the left.

00:18:16.635 --> 00:18:18.510
And so there's a net
flux, particles leaving,

00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:20.010
concentration is
going to come down.

00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:28.730
Now are there any questions
about what we've said?

00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:31.870
If you find this
discussion confusing,

00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:35.560
I would strongly encourage you
to get together with a friend

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:38.485
and just draw some
random lines, curves,

00:18:38.485 --> 00:18:39.860
and just make sure
you understand

00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:42.197
where diffusion is going to
pull things and so forth.

00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:45.505
No questions?

00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:56.780
All right, I just want
to say a few things

00:18:56.780 --> 00:19:01.120
about the so-called French
flag model in development.

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:05.709
This is perhaps the most famous.

00:19:05.709 --> 00:19:07.875
Does everybody know what
the French flag looks like?

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:12.860
What's that?

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:13.470
All right.

00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:16.430
There are three stripes
and some orientation.

00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:19.310
No, but the idea here is
just that a simple way

00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:23.610
to specify a structure
across one axis

00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:28.280
is to have a defusing chemical
or generally a protein.

00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:31.040
And then based on the
concentration of that protein

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:34.430
or morphogen, you can just
have the tissue read out

00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:37.500
what it's supposed to be,
or what it's supposed to do.

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:40.720
So the idea here
is that, you have

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:45.620
some morphogen that starts
maybe on one end of an embryo

00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:48.340
and then diffuses.

00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:50.790
So we end up with
some curve that

00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:55.090
tells us about the
morphogen concentration

00:19:55.090 --> 00:19:57.730
as a function of position.

00:19:57.730 --> 00:19:59.450
This is a functional position.

00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:03.620
So this is along the embryo.

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:06.040
Now the general challenge in
the context of development

00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:10.900
is asking-- we
started this embryo

00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:13.130
with many different
cells, they're

00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:15.870
all genetically identical,
and they all start out maybe

00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:18.050
without any positional
information.

00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:19.360
They don't know where they are.

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:20.735
But what that
means is they don't

00:20:20.735 --> 00:20:25.000
know they need to develop into
a head or a tail or something

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.630
in between.

00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:31.920
Now what often happens is that
you can have a deposition often

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:35.100
by the mother so you have a
maternal deposition of, say,

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:39.170
RNA that leads to expression
of some morphogen on one end

00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:40.134
and then it diffuses.

00:20:40.134 --> 00:20:41.550
And based on the
concentration you

00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:46.120
can say what part of the body
you should be developing into.

00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:49.410
So the idea is you just
have these thresholds that

00:20:49.410 --> 00:20:51.570
might be some M1, M2.

00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:59.870
All right, now all
the cells over here

00:20:59.870 --> 00:21:03.030
know that they should
maybe develop into a head.

00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:06.830
Over here, they're going to
develop into the mid body.

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:10.420
And over down here it could
be the low body, for example.

00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:14.270
So just from the
concentration that a cell

00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:15.840
feels at a particular location.

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:18.260
So if you had a cell
right here, you just

00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:21.540
say OK the concentration of
morphogens between M1 and M2

00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:26.770
and then from that you know
what l you're supposed be.

00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:35.500
Now if you have no
degradation within the body.

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:43.950
Let's just imagine you
say, that at one end is 0.

00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:48.380
We're told morphogen
concentration is M0.

00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:51.810
And let's say that the other
end, we know the morphogen

00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:53.560
concentration is going to be 0.

00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:58.520
Let's say there's a lot
of degradation at an end.

00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:00.480
If there's no
degradation in between,

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:04.620
what should the profile
look like given these?

00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:05.580
So, no.

00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:09.490
All right.

00:22:09.490 --> 00:22:13.960
So just diffusion with
these boundary conditions.

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:17.030
I'm going to draw some
options and hopefully you

00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:19.970
can close your eyes and
imagine what it should be.

00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:26.350
All right, we know that starts
out M0 over L is equal to 0.

00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:45.930
Is it closer to A, B, C, or D?

00:22:56.450 --> 00:22:59.030
Do you understand
what I'm asking?

00:22:59.030 --> 00:22:59.800
Yes.

00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:01.360
AUDIENCE: That is
a steady state.

00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:04.620
PROFESSOR: This is the steady
state concentration profile

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:09.390
of the morphogen given there's
no degradation in the interior.

00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:12.270
Ready three, two, one.

00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:16.020
All right.

00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:19.100
So at least a majority are
agreeing it's going to be B.

00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:23.940
Although, there's a significant
minority that's saying A.

00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:27.030
This is why I'm bring
this up because, we're

00:23:27.030 --> 00:23:29.100
so used to seeing
exponential profiles

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:31.610
and think that you should
always be getting them.

00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:34.860
And I want to be clear why
it's an exponential profile.

00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:36.940
That's the thing we start
with, and for example

00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:39.670
this model in [INAUDIBLE] book.

00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:43.140
Noori's book, you get
exponential profiles

00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:47.140
as a result of first
order degradation.

00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:51.390
Whereas if you don't have any
degradation in the interior,

00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:58.840
then we say, OK, DCD-- well,
do we want to use C or M now?

00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:00.610
We'll use M, just
because now we're

00:24:00.610 --> 00:24:03.130
thinking very particularly
for morphogen.

00:24:03.130 --> 00:24:04.585
All so DMDT.

00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:15.290
We want to know the
steady state profile.

00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:16.535
We set this thing equal to 0.

00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:22.920
Integrate twice.

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:25.790
Right, so we're going to get--
morphogen profile should just

00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:28.914
be some Ax plus B, OK?

00:24:35.310 --> 00:24:37.200
My line's kind of
crappy, I'm sorry.

00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:43.780
However, when we have
first order degradation,

00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:46.100
then we get these
exponential profiles.

00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:52.750
Are there any questions about--?

00:24:52.750 --> 00:24:56.710
AUDIENCE: Is it possible
to have [INAUDIBLE]?

00:24:56.710 --> 00:24:59.420
PROFESSOR: Yeah, right.

00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:01.659
What does this require?

00:25:01.659 --> 00:25:05.603
AUDIENCE: The morphogen
is generated into halves.

00:25:05.603 --> 00:25:07.876
X equals 0 and then--

00:25:07.876 --> 00:25:09.000
PROFESSOR: Degraded it at--

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:09.900
AUDIENCE: Disappearing.

00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:10.566
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:25:10.566 --> 00:25:11.820
Right.

00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:16.430
That's what I'm saying, is that
when I said that at the end

00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:19.940
it was a 0, this means that we
have degradation at this point.

00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:24.470
Any time that the morphogen
reaches the end of the embryos,

00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:25.400
it gets degraded.

00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:31.420
So it's not degradation inside
if it's only degradation here.

00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:34.100
And this of course a situation
where you have constant flux

00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:36.860
throughout the embryo,
constant rate of production

00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:40.100
of the morphogen, constant
rate of degradation over here.

00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:47.490
But when you have this
first order degradation--

00:25:47.490 --> 00:25:51.430
if we're told that
instead-- well, maybe.

00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:12.000
So, if in addition
to having diffusion,

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.180
you also have this
first order degradation.

00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:17.910
Now remember M is a function
of both x and t, right?

00:26:17.910 --> 00:26:23.890
And this is the situation where
we get exponential profiles.

00:26:23.890 --> 00:26:27.500
Now in Murray's book,
he often discusses

00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:32.310
this where the
boundary condition

00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:37.540
is that you have some
concentration M0 at one end.

00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:44.002
And then we get an
exponential profile here.

00:26:44.002 --> 00:26:45.710
What was the characteristic
length scale?

00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:54.930
This is something we should
be able to figure out.

00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:07.160
You should, of course, be
able to solve the equations,

00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:10.590
but you should be
able to figure it out

00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:13.670
from our favorite approach
of dimensional analysis.

00:27:13.670 --> 00:27:17.040
What's the units of things here?

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:20.740
So units of D is what?

00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:21.910
Length squared over time.

00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:29.500
Units of alpha?

00:27:34.930 --> 00:27:38.220
So this is a morphogen
concentration over a time.

00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:40.812
This is a morphogen
concentration.

00:27:40.812 --> 00:27:42.395
So this thing has
to be one over time.

00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:47.620
So the length
scale is then going

00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:58.960
to have to go as the
square root of D over L.

00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:01.790
And indeed, if you solve it,
it's exactly equal to that,

00:28:01.790 --> 00:28:04.199
but this dimensional
analysis just told us

00:28:04.199 --> 00:28:05.490
that it had to scale like that.

00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:10.780
So this is telling us about
a characteristic length

00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:13.930
of which this morphogen
profile is going to fall off.

00:28:13.930 --> 00:28:20.100
This is the
characteristic length L.

00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:22.860
Incidentally, you'll
see many cases

00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:24.800
of things that look like this.

00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:28.060
So if there's first
order rate that's

00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:32.940
something is either degraded
or is uptaken or whatnot, then

00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:37.450
together with diffusion, you'll
get an exponential profile

00:28:37.450 --> 00:28:39.964
with a [INAUDIBLE] length scale
that's given by this ratio.

00:28:39.964 --> 00:28:41.880
And you'll see this in
many different contexts

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:46.890
of, for example, nutrients
going into a biofilm.

00:28:46.890 --> 00:28:49.780
If you have cells
picking up nutrients

00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:53.340
then it's not that
it's being degraded,

00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:55.162
but it's being imported.

00:28:55.162 --> 00:28:56.620
Then you'll have
a similar process.

00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:07.310
This is a nice, fine situation
except for what was the problem

00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:08.520
that [INAUDIBLE] pointed out?

00:29:11.490 --> 00:29:12.187
It's not robust.

00:29:12.187 --> 00:29:13.395
It's not robust against what?

00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:20.500
Initial condition.

00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:24.630
Yes, but I think we have to be
a little more specific on that.

00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:26.420
Right, it's not robust
to changes in M0.

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:39.760
Incidentally, in
most context, I think

00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:41.300
for mathematical
simplicity, it's

00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:45.820
useful to just have a banner
condition where M0 is constant.

00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:50.560
But in general, is
that what the mother is

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:53.070
going to be fixing necessarily?

00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:54.820
What would the mother
typically be fixing?

00:29:58.370 --> 00:29:59.625
What was that?

00:29:59.625 --> 00:30:00.960
AUDIENCE: Production rate.

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:02.824
PROFESSOR: Production rate.

00:30:02.824 --> 00:30:04.490
How do we figure out
what the production

00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:05.700
rate is in this situation?

00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:13.990
That's right, the flux ware.

00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:15.020
That's right.

00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:18.055
The production rate is
the flux right at or just

00:30:18.055 --> 00:30:21.310
to the right of 0.

00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:23.680
Incidentally, where's
the flux maximal here?

00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:27.560
Is it maximal at A, B, or C?

00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:29.660
Ready three, two, one.

00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:30.690
You can do it verbally.

00:30:30.690 --> 00:30:31.270
Fun.

00:30:31.270 --> 00:30:33.160
A. Right.

00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:36.720
And that's because the
profile steepest here and then

00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:39.510
shallows out.

00:30:39.510 --> 00:30:41.450
So flux is decreasing here.

00:30:41.450 --> 00:30:46.110
And that's because some of the
morphogen is being degraded.

00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:49.990
So indeed, we can figure
out the production rate.

00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:54.360
Right.

00:30:54.360 --> 00:31:02.950
This is equal to the flux,
which is equal to minus

00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:06.290
DCDX at that location.

00:31:06.290 --> 00:31:08.825
Right, so the
morphogen profile M

00:31:08.825 --> 00:31:13.380
is a function of x is
some M0e to the minus x

00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:16.160
over L, where L is given by
this character of lengthscale,

00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:18.080
right?

00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:22.290
So if we ask what's DMDX?

00:31:22.290 --> 00:31:26.330
Well, it's going to
be-- we get a minus M0

00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:35.690
over L. Evaluated at x equal
to 0 just makes that go away,

00:31:35.690 --> 00:31:38.640
so we end up with this.

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:42.030
So you figure out
what flux is, right?

00:31:42.030 --> 00:31:45.310
Yeah, so, it's just an extra
couple terms, it's fine.

00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:47.450
But that would be what
would typically be constant

00:31:47.450 --> 00:31:51.800
because there might be
some RNA deposit there

00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:56.110
or if it's actually
transcription off of the genes

00:31:56.110 --> 00:32:00.230
at in the cells in
this location and then

00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:03.538
it's based on whether there's
one or two copies and so forth.

00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:14.630
So this is all fine, except
that this thing is not robust.

00:32:14.630 --> 00:32:17.647
It changes in M0 or
this production rate.

00:32:17.647 --> 00:32:19.730
Whereas in many cases,
what we seek experimentally

00:32:19.730 --> 00:32:23.670
is that if we, for example,
have the production rate,

00:32:23.670 --> 00:32:26.410
then the profile
that we see out here

00:32:26.410 --> 00:32:29.511
is somehow remarkably similar.

00:32:29.511 --> 00:32:30.010
Yes?

00:32:30.010 --> 00:32:31.978
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:35.172 --> 00:32:35.880
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:38.940
Yeah, OK.

00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:41.980
So I'd say that in
many cases, it's

00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:46.500
not that it's directly
this M squared business.

00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:50.230
But there are a number of
cases in Drosophila, where

00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:53.060
they actually do see this.

00:32:53.060 --> 00:33:00.310
In many cases, it was a self
enhanced degradation but not

00:33:00.310 --> 00:33:03.690
that it was directly, it was
via binding to a receptor.

00:33:03.690 --> 00:33:07.180
So this was seen in
patch lists together.

00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:15.060
I want to remember which
were the models that-- I'm

00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:17.310
worried I'm always doing it
get so it's like patchless

00:33:17.310 --> 00:33:20.780
and frizzled, or-- are
there any Drosophila people

00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:24.650
here that came up with
these crazy names?

00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:33.700
All right, yeah, so
I always got confused

00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:35.857
which are the
morphogens and which

00:33:35.857 --> 00:33:37.440
are the receptors
in these situations.

00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:41.320
But I'd say that it
is something that's

00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:46.790
observed in number of
different contexts,

00:33:46.790 --> 00:33:49.050
at different stages of
development, both in Drosophila

00:33:49.050 --> 00:33:53.160
and-- they see this in the
wing as well as in the body.

00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:58.480
And so in different stages
I think it is signature.

00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:01.520
But I'm very much not a
developmental biologist.

00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:16.050
All right so the proposal that
[INAUDIBLE] suggests as a way

00:34:16.050 --> 00:34:23.540
to make this thing more robust
is to somehow change this term.

00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:30.429
Now, the goal in all this was
to have some degradation rate.

00:34:30.429 --> 00:34:33.570
And he writes it as F is
a function concentration

00:34:33.570 --> 00:34:35.710
M. In principle,
this thing could

00:34:35.710 --> 00:34:38.370
be a function of the position
x, but he doesn't want that.

00:34:38.370 --> 00:34:40.036
And why was it that
he didn't want that?

00:34:44.642 --> 00:34:45.142
Yeah.

00:34:45.142 --> 00:34:48.723
AUDIENCE: Because we
already know [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:48.723 --> 00:34:49.639
PROFESSOR: Yes, right.

00:34:49.639 --> 00:34:51.420
So the whole goal
is that we want

00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:53.170
to start with some
situation where

00:34:53.170 --> 00:34:56.469
we don't know where we are
as a function of position x.

00:34:56.469 --> 00:34:59.504
And then from that get
some spatial information.

00:34:59.504 --> 00:35:00.920
So we really want
something that's

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:03.210
not a function of x in there.

00:35:03.210 --> 00:35:05.947
Because then we've
already solved the problem

00:35:05.947 --> 00:35:07.155
that we're trying to address.

00:35:18.050 --> 00:35:20.060
And so one proposal
is indeed just

00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:21.660
to have something
that-- and this is

00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:24.230
very much a phenomenological
approach-- which

00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:28.250
is to have this thing be
self enhanced degradation.

00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:44.837
So the idea is that here if we
have the morphogen profile that

00:35:44.837 --> 00:35:45.920
looks something like this.

00:35:51.310 --> 00:35:52.810
There are multiple
ways you can have

00:35:52.810 --> 00:35:54.290
something that looks like this.

00:35:54.290 --> 00:35:59.040
So if along the way to
degradation, if the morphogen

00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:02.930
actually binds the receptor, but
then activates the degradation.

00:36:02.930 --> 00:36:07.590
And this is seen, for
example, in Drosophila.

00:36:07.590 --> 00:36:10.110
This is Hedgehog and Patched.

00:36:10.110 --> 00:36:15.380
So R is-- in this case,
you have the morphogen

00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:17.110
is diffusing outside the cells.

00:36:17.110 --> 00:36:20.830
It binds to the receptor,
and then the receptor

00:36:20.830 --> 00:36:24.860
activates imported
degradation of the morphogen.

00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:27.950
So it's not that the
morphogen is directly

00:36:27.950 --> 00:36:31.980
leading to its own degradation,
but it's via some network here.

00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:34.695
And there was another
one that they talk about,

00:36:34.695 --> 00:36:40.710
which is that, when the
degradation is mediated by 2.

00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:42.640
These look like this,
and this is in context.

00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:46.260
And this is again Drosophila,
but you could probably

00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:47.650
guess what this thing does.

00:36:51.410 --> 00:36:53.460
And so it is a wing
development as well.

00:36:58.646 --> 00:37:01.020
If you write down an actual
model of one of these things,

00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:02.260
and you could play
with it and see

00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:03.730
where you're going to get
something that's going to look

00:37:03.730 --> 00:37:05.700
like an M squared type term.

00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:08.714
But the nice thing about this
phenomenological approach

00:37:08.714 --> 00:37:11.005
is it kind of gives you a
sense of the kinds of effects

00:37:11.005 --> 00:37:13.239
that you should be looking
for that will enhance

00:37:13.239 --> 00:37:14.488
the robustness of the pattern.

00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:21.690
Now the key thing in this
whole discussion to remember

00:37:21.690 --> 00:37:27.970
is that if you have a
profile here, if you change,

00:37:27.970 --> 00:37:29.495
it's just somehow
translationally

00:37:29.495 --> 00:37:31.260
invarion in the sense
that since there's

00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:33.850
no information about
where you are here,

00:37:33.850 --> 00:37:35.930
these patterns can
kind of slide over.

00:37:35.930 --> 00:37:38.860
So if you change the
boundary condition M0,

00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:41.340
that's just equivalent to
sliding this over some distance

00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:44.120
and you could figure out
where everything has to go.

00:37:48.270 --> 00:37:50.990
And that's true not just
for the exponential profile,

00:37:50.990 --> 00:37:52.580
but for any of the profiles.

00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:55.460
And that's just because there's
no information about what's

00:37:55.460 --> 00:37:57.910
going on once you're
inside the embryo.

00:38:00.730 --> 00:38:03.620
Can somebody give the
intuitive explanation

00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:06.490
for why some sort of self
enhanced degradation like this

00:38:06.490 --> 00:38:09.245
might make the
pattern more robust?

00:38:15.566 --> 00:38:19.030
AUDIENCE: Decrease
faster [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:21.200
PROFESSOR: Decrease
faster when M is big.

00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:21.950
That's right.

00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:26.947
And so the idea is that
if you change the M0 here,

00:38:26.947 --> 00:38:28.780
for example, you double
it, then with a self

00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:30.863
enhanced degradation you
kind of quickly come back

00:38:30.863 --> 00:38:31.892
to where you were.

00:38:31.892 --> 00:38:36.340
So there's some sense that if
the pattern quickly comes down,

00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:40.280
then you can get it
being more robust.

00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:47.230
In particular, this
profile for large x

00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:50.210
in the proper regime,
this thing falls off

00:38:50.210 --> 00:38:56.540
as some A a over x squared.

00:38:56.540 --> 00:38:58.950
And indeed, one of the
problems in Murray's book

00:38:58.950 --> 00:39:02.070
is that if this is just
degrading as M to some power n,

00:39:02.070 --> 00:39:04.940
then you can calculate
what happens here.

00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:07.980
But this is some sort
of power law fall off.

00:39:16.010 --> 00:39:20.290
So of course, it's falling
off rapidly here, but not

00:39:20.290 --> 00:39:23.130
as rapidly as if it
were an exponential.

00:39:23.130 --> 00:39:25.350
And this is just like in
the case of the power law

00:39:25.350 --> 00:39:27.700
distributions of networks
that we were talking about

00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:31.110
before, that for the
exponential fall off,

00:39:31.110 --> 00:39:32.620
then it's just
very, very unlikely

00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:35.310
that you'll find some
node with many edges.

00:39:35.310 --> 00:39:39.790
Similarly here, you quickly
fall to zero here as compared

00:39:39.790 --> 00:39:41.040
to a power law distribution.

00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:46.380
So that means that you can
specify patterns out further

00:39:46.380 --> 00:39:47.070
in some sense.

00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:56.340
Are there any questions
about this basic idea

00:39:56.340 --> 00:39:57.510
and where it comes from?

00:40:06.161 --> 00:40:07.910
I think the discussion
in [INAUDIBLE] book

00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:09.820
is actually reasonable.

00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:14.960
So I don't really want to
spend too much time on it.

00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:19.100
In the context of
the eldar model

00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:24.014
that was from the last
section of that chapter.

00:40:24.014 --> 00:40:25.430
One thing I just
want to highlight

00:40:25.430 --> 00:40:31.360
is that it's useful to be
able to look at these models,

00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:33.580
and from the equations
that you see-- for example,

00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:35.440
the supplemental
material of a paper--

00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:39.160
make sure you are very clear
about what assumptions they've

00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:42.630
made in getting to this model.

00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:49.615
And so maybe we'll just spend a
few minutes talking about this.

00:40:52.530 --> 00:40:56.270
So this is again a
Drosphil embryo two,

00:40:56.270 --> 00:41:02.970
two and a half hours
after fertilization

00:41:02.970 --> 00:41:09.710
where at that stage, you
really have the embryo that

00:41:09.710 --> 00:41:13.020
looks like a-- we're trying
to understand the patterning

00:41:13.020 --> 00:41:17.060
around the front back.

00:41:17.060 --> 00:41:19.810
So we think about diffusion
along in one dimension,

00:41:19.810 --> 00:41:23.180
but it's really around
this radial direction.

00:41:23.180 --> 00:41:28.290
And in particular, where this is
trying to understand patterning

00:41:28.290 --> 00:41:29.330
in the dorsal region.

00:41:32.690 --> 00:41:36.810
And what we have is
a situation where we

00:41:36.810 --> 00:41:40.610
have this protease inhibitor.

00:41:40.610 --> 00:41:43.090
And so the protease
distributed uniformly.

00:41:43.090 --> 00:41:46.210
Inhibitor starts out
out there, and then we

00:41:46.210 --> 00:41:48.820
have the morphogen that
somehow starts out in here.

00:41:48.820 --> 00:41:50.650
And we want to end
up with a situation

00:41:50.650 --> 00:41:55.090
where the morphogen profile in
here is kind of well defined.

00:41:55.090 --> 00:41:56.590
So where you just
have the morphogen

00:41:56.590 --> 00:41:59.401
at the center of
this dorsal region.

00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:05.490
And then we have diffusion
of these inhibitors

00:42:05.490 --> 00:42:07.710
coming in and then the
morphogen coming out.

00:42:07.710 --> 00:42:13.040
And the question is, how
can we make sense of this?

00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:19.220
And if you look at the equations
that they write down-- So

00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:20.770
we have diffusion
of the inhibitor.

00:42:33.350 --> 00:42:36.950
This is the complex
of the inhibitor

00:42:36.950 --> 00:42:40.660
and the morphogen-- complex c.

00:43:10.610 --> 00:43:13.380
And so this is a case
where they wrote down

00:43:13.380 --> 00:43:15.950
what they basically knew
about the biologists system.

00:43:15.950 --> 00:43:19.130
And then they asked, well,
what range of parameters

00:43:19.130 --> 00:43:26.690
would lead to a robust pattern
of the morphogen in here,

00:43:26.690 --> 00:43:30.340
if you vary things such as the
total concentration inhibitor,

00:43:30.340 --> 00:43:32.130
the morphogen or the protease?

00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:39.540
So we have diffusion of each
of these things, the inhibitor,

00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:42.690
the morphogen complex.

00:43:42.690 --> 00:43:44.670
We're not going to worry
about the protease,

00:43:44.670 --> 00:43:46.645
because this thing is
uniformly distributed.

00:43:46.645 --> 00:43:49.020
You can argue about whether
that's the right thing to do,

00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:51.350
but that's based on the model.

00:43:51.350 --> 00:43:54.920
So we have diffusion
of each of these guys.

00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:56.745
Can somebody say
what's going on here?

00:44:07.870 --> 00:44:10.304
What are these things
trying to capture?

00:44:10.304 --> 00:44:10.804
John?

00:44:10.804 --> 00:44:12.414
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:12.414 --> 00:44:13.830
PROFESSOR: So this
is just saying,

00:44:13.830 --> 00:44:17.412
OK, the complex is formed
as a result of binding

00:44:17.412 --> 00:44:18.870
of the inhibitor
and the morphogen.

00:44:18.870 --> 00:44:21.080
It's proportional to
concentration those two things,

00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:24.080
at that particular position
at the particular time.

00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:28.820
And just remember that any
time that you create something,

00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:31.130
if you have binding at
two things together,

00:44:31.130 --> 00:44:34.875
then you have to consider
these things going away.

00:44:34.875 --> 00:44:36.850
And it's not they're
being degraded,

00:44:36.850 --> 00:44:39.482
it's just that they're
forming this complex.

00:44:39.482 --> 00:44:40.940
So in these equations
you just have

00:44:40.940 --> 00:44:42.523
to be very careful
about keeping track

00:44:42.523 --> 00:44:44.624
of which things are
really going away

00:44:44.624 --> 00:44:46.290
and which things are
just changing form.

00:44:46.290 --> 00:44:46.772
Yeah?

00:44:46.772 --> 00:44:47.688
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:53.580 --> 00:44:55.930
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:44:55.930 --> 00:45:00.540
You're saying why that
there's not a minus term?

00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:02.242
So this is an assumption.

00:45:02.242 --> 00:45:03.700
And I think this
is a kind of thing

00:45:03.700 --> 00:45:06.300
that you have to be clear
about in any of these,

00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:09.440
because that's always going
to occur at some rate.

00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:12.830
And the assumption is
that this is dominant.

00:45:16.154 --> 00:45:18.320
And then just be clear in
words, what is this thing?

00:45:27.554 --> 00:45:30.202
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:30.202 --> 00:45:30.910
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:45:30.910 --> 00:45:32.900
The protease.

00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:34.949
And you're saying
cleaving inhibitor.

00:45:34.949 --> 00:45:36.490
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
cleaving the compacts

00:45:36.490 --> 00:45:39.372
by degrading the [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:39.372 --> 00:45:40.080
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:43.340
So at a rate proportional to
the Proteus concentration--

00:45:43.340 --> 00:45:47.519
the complex concentration--
this complex goes away.

00:45:47.519 --> 00:45:49.810
Now the question is we have
to figure out where it went

00:45:49.810 --> 00:45:52.180
or what happened, right?

00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:54.210
Well we have a
minus alpha c here

00:45:54.210 --> 00:45:56.750
but then we have a
plus alpha c here.

00:45:56.750 --> 00:46:00.570
But this isn't the
morphogen right.

00:46:00.570 --> 00:46:05.020
This is at the rate
that the complex somehow

00:46:05.020 --> 00:46:07.180
is being disappeared
by the protease,

00:46:07.180 --> 00:46:11.340
the morphogen is appearing.

00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:15.620
But then, we don't have
the same term here.

00:46:15.620 --> 00:46:19.270
And that's how you know that
what the protease is doing

00:46:19.270 --> 00:46:26.670
is it's degrading the inhibitor
as part of the complex.

00:46:26.670 --> 00:46:28.070
So by looking at
these equations,

00:46:28.070 --> 00:46:30.710
you can actually figure out
what are the assumptions that

00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:32.805
have been made of
what the biology is

00:46:32.805 --> 00:46:33.960
that's being captured here.

00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:36.209
But in many cases, there are
assumptions of what's big

00:46:36.209 --> 00:46:38.547
and what's small.

00:46:38.547 --> 00:46:39.880
And then what's this thing here?

00:46:50.050 --> 00:46:52.647
Somebody else that has not
yet-- do these equations

00:46:52.647 --> 00:46:53.230
look familiar?

00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:56.981
Yes, please.

00:46:56.981 --> 00:47:00.750
AUDIENCE: It's the
protease [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:00.750 --> 00:47:01.750
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:47:01.750 --> 00:47:05.380
It's the protease degrading the
inhibitor when the inhibitor is

00:47:05.380 --> 00:47:09.840
not down to the
morphogen. Now of course,

00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:13.540
what the authors did next
is they searched numerically

00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:16.000
across parameter space
over [INAUDIBLE] magnitude,

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.570
and they found that for
some parameter regime

00:47:18.570 --> 00:47:22.960
there was a robust pattern
of the morphogen developed

00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:24.879
in here.

00:47:24.879 --> 00:47:26.920
There's no reason for you
to necessarily remember

00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:29.620
which thing it was.

00:47:29.620 --> 00:47:35.070
But what they found is
that if this term went away

00:47:35.070 --> 00:47:40.340
and this term went
away, then you

00:47:40.340 --> 00:47:46.460
end up getting a robust
profile of the morphogen

00:47:46.460 --> 00:47:49.430
against changes in the
overall morphogen inhibitor

00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:50.760
concentration.

00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:52.860
Now this is pretty
weird, I would say.

00:47:55.192 --> 00:47:57.150
I don't know, do you
think-- is this one weird?

00:48:01.830 --> 00:48:03.910
Weirdness is in the
eye of the beholder.

00:48:03.910 --> 00:48:06.520
But I would say it's
not so shocking.

00:48:11.650 --> 00:48:15.465
Can somebody say verbally
what this would correspond to?

00:48:15.465 --> 00:48:17.671
AUDIENCE: The protease
doesn't degrade the inhibitor

00:48:17.671 --> 00:48:18.170
on its own.

00:48:18.170 --> 00:48:19.800
PROFESSOR: That's right,
the protease doesn't degrade

00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:21.310
the inhibitor on
its own, only when

00:48:21.310 --> 00:48:23.560
it's part of the complex
with the morphogen.

00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:25.780
And independently there was
experimental data already

00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:26.821
indicating that was true.

00:48:26.821 --> 00:48:28.780
So you could have if
you want to just written

00:48:28.780 --> 00:48:31.285
the model without that,
because there was already

00:48:31.285 --> 00:48:32.120
evidence for that.

00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:39.190
But as I said, this is
a pretty weird thing.

00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:43.180
And so, this would be saying
that, for some reason,

00:48:43.180 --> 00:48:49.940
diffusion of the morphogen
on its own is very small.

00:48:49.940 --> 00:48:52.280
In particular, small compared
diffusion of the morphogen

00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:53.195
when it's a complex.

00:48:58.190 --> 00:49:01.499
Now can somebody say why I
might think that's weird?

00:49:01.499 --> 00:49:03.040
You don't have to
believe it's weird.

00:49:08.752 --> 00:49:10.755
AUDIENCE: You'd think
bigger is better.

00:49:10.755 --> 00:49:12.210
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:49:12.210 --> 00:49:13.102
Exactly.

00:49:13.102 --> 00:49:15.310
This is saying, well, when
it's complex, it's bigger,

00:49:15.310 --> 00:49:16.800
it's somehow diffusing faster.

00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:22.750
So this would not happen do
the simple Stokes type drag.

00:49:22.750 --> 00:49:24.940
This would have to be biology.

00:49:28.776 --> 00:49:31.150
Somebody's biology is allowed
to do anything that doesn't

00:49:31.150 --> 00:49:32.550
violate the laws of physics.

00:49:32.550 --> 00:49:35.720
Indeed, later there was
experimental evidence

00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:39.015
of something like this
was actually happening.

00:49:39.015 --> 00:49:40.670
And you could
imagine having either

00:49:40.670 --> 00:49:44.530
from sort of active transport
type dynamics for the complex,

00:49:44.530 --> 00:49:52.380
or from binding type
dynamics of the morphogen.

00:49:52.380 --> 00:49:54.650
I think the key thing to
take from this example

00:49:54.650 --> 00:49:58.030
is just that, in
general, we would

00:49:58.030 --> 00:50:01.420
like biological function--
biology would like

00:50:01.420 --> 00:50:05.150
biological function to be
robust to things that are often

00:50:05.150 --> 00:50:06.840
fluctuating or varying.

00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:10.755
And that's one way to try to
make guesses about what might

00:50:10.755 --> 00:50:11.880
be happening in the system.

00:50:11.880 --> 00:50:14.560
This sort of
computational exercise

00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:18.200
is not all a proof that this
has to be what's happening.

00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:19.700
They wrote down a
particular model--

00:50:19.700 --> 00:50:22.074
it could have been that there
are other terms they're not

00:50:22.074 --> 00:50:23.010
aware of and so forth.

00:50:23.010 --> 00:50:25.010
But it's at least a way
of generating hypotheses

00:50:25.010 --> 00:50:28.690
that you can go and test.

00:50:28.690 --> 00:50:30.840
And quite generally,
I'd also say

00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:37.030
that its essential for all
of us as consumers of models

00:50:37.030 --> 00:50:40.190
to be able to look at
some of these equations

00:50:40.190 --> 00:50:42.440
and figure out what it
is that they've assumed.

00:50:49.620 --> 00:50:53.970
I want to move on to
this idea of pattern

00:50:53.970 --> 00:50:57.150
formation via the
reaction diffusion

00:50:57.150 --> 00:50:59.480
or Turing-type patterns.

00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:01.400
And I think it's
really important

00:51:01.400 --> 00:51:05.950
to start by just acknowledging
that this is really

00:51:05.950 --> 00:51:09.230
a surprising finding, that
it's even possible for this

00:51:09.230 --> 00:51:10.430
to happen.

00:51:10.430 --> 00:51:12.860
Because this is
a situation where

00:51:12.860 --> 00:51:17.490
you have a couple
chemicals-- or proteins,

00:51:17.490 --> 00:51:23.910
or reacting elements--
and if you just mix them,

00:51:23.910 --> 00:51:26.730
if you have them in
some well mixed tube,

00:51:26.730 --> 00:51:30.270
they reach some steady state.

00:51:30.270 --> 00:51:32.250
Whereas somehow if
you allow diffusion,

00:51:32.250 --> 00:51:36.590
then you can get these patterns.

00:51:36.590 --> 00:51:38.667
And I would say based on
my intuition at least,

00:51:38.667 --> 00:51:40.875
I would not have thought
that this would be possible.

00:51:43.590 --> 00:51:47.520
And this really just is because
if you can just imagine,

00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:49.140
you start with some profile.

00:51:49.140 --> 00:51:51.810
Now there's some structure here.

00:51:51.810 --> 00:51:53.700
But diffusion's going
to actually cause

00:51:53.700 --> 00:51:56.080
this to come down,
and this to come up.

00:51:56.080 --> 00:52:00.720
So diffusion acts to remove
these spatial patterns.

00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:03.870
But somehow in
some prime regimes,

00:52:03.870 --> 00:52:07.280
if you have coupled
reactions that

00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:09.140
are activating and
inhibiting each other,

00:52:09.140 --> 00:52:12.900
then you can actually get
these spatial patterns.

00:52:12.900 --> 00:52:16.910
And as you read about,
there's some idea

00:52:16.910 --> 00:52:19.730
that you need to have
a local activation

00:52:19.730 --> 00:52:21.550
and a global inhibition.

00:52:21.550 --> 00:52:25.266
But ultimately the
mathematical-- you always

00:52:25.266 --> 00:52:27.640
have to go and think about
more carefully about the math,

00:52:27.640 --> 00:52:30.060
and would be indicated
just by those words.

00:52:30.060 --> 00:52:33.820
This is at least a way to guide
your thinking a little bit.

00:52:33.820 --> 00:52:38.010
But ultimately what
matters are around this

00:52:38.010 --> 00:52:40.330
stable what would be
the stable fixed point,

00:52:40.330 --> 00:52:43.490
you have to actually look at
these derivatives and so forth.

00:52:43.490 --> 00:52:47.312
And the derivatives can
be subtle I would say.

00:52:47.312 --> 00:52:48.770
Just because you
think of something

00:52:48.770 --> 00:52:51.070
as activator
inhibitor doesn't mean

00:52:51.070 --> 00:52:54.300
that it's going to have that
role around the fix point

00:52:54.300 --> 00:52:55.200
that you're studying.

00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:56.770
So this is just a caution.

00:53:04.030 --> 00:53:05.630
What I want to do
is just give you,

00:53:05.630 --> 00:53:08.410
for example, one example
of a simple model

00:53:08.410 --> 00:53:11.850
that does experience
these Turing patterns.

00:53:11.850 --> 00:53:13.610
And in an appropriate regime.

00:53:13.610 --> 00:53:18.254
And this Levin-Segel model
of pattern formation.

00:53:25.900 --> 00:53:29.120
And this was published in
1976, and it was actually

00:53:29.120 --> 00:53:33.520
meant as a model of
predator-prey interactions

00:53:33.520 --> 00:53:35.990
in ecology.

00:53:35.990 --> 00:53:38.570
We'll talk
significantly more about

00:53:38.570 --> 00:53:40.530
predator-prey interactions
in a few weeks.

00:53:40.530 --> 00:53:45.900
But I just want to write
down what they said.

00:53:45.900 --> 00:53:48.710
And this is a simplified
model of their stuff.

00:53:48.710 --> 00:53:55.780
So it's actually trying to think
about some plankton herbivore

00:53:55.780 --> 00:53:58.110
before interactions.

00:53:58.110 --> 00:54:02.120
And this is derivative
with respect to time.

00:54:02.120 --> 00:54:05.410
We're going to follow the
nomenclature of a paper

00:54:05.410 --> 00:54:08.350
by Butler and Goldenfeld
a few years ago,

00:54:08.350 --> 00:54:09.850
because they're the
ones who thought

00:54:09.850 --> 00:54:11.974
about the demographic noise
enhancing the patterns.

00:54:30.090 --> 00:54:53.160
PROFESSOR: All right, so we have
[? phi ?] and [? phi. ?] First

00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:54.420
of all, who's eating whom?

00:55:07.460 --> 00:55:09.560
All right, we're going
to say it verbally.

00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:11.710
Who is the predator?

00:55:11.710 --> 00:55:14.730
Ready three, two, one.

00:55:14.730 --> 00:55:15.620
AUDIENCE: Herbivore.

00:55:15.620 --> 00:55:16.495
PROFESSOR: Herbivore.

00:55:19.590 --> 00:55:22.210
Herbivores are not
what they used to be.

00:55:22.210 --> 00:55:26.570
So indeed, the herbivore
benefits from the presence

00:55:26.570 --> 00:55:29.140
of the plankton.

00:55:29.140 --> 00:55:31.456
So nobody cares about
plankton, I guess.

00:55:34.210 --> 00:55:38.740
So this corresponds to the
predator-prey type interaction.

00:55:38.740 --> 00:55:41.100
So there's some death rate.

00:55:41.100 --> 00:55:45.100
So let's see, the
herbivore or the predator.

00:55:45.100 --> 00:55:47.460
And then what you see is
there's these two growth

00:55:47.460 --> 00:55:49.640
terms for the plankton.

00:55:49.640 --> 00:55:51.400
So there's this term,
which would be kind

00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:54.779
of simple, exponential growth.

00:55:54.779 --> 00:55:56.320
And then this term,
which is actually

00:55:56.320 --> 00:55:58.850
some sort of super
exponential growth.

00:55:58.850 --> 00:56:05.690
There's some sense in which the
plankton benefit each other.

00:56:05.690 --> 00:56:08.320
And this was originally
introduced because of something

00:56:08.320 --> 00:56:10.200
called predator satiation.

00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:14.150
But it's just a general
reflection of the fact

00:56:14.150 --> 00:56:16.650
that in many cases, individuals
benefit from the presence

00:56:16.650 --> 00:56:19.679
of other individuals.

00:56:19.679 --> 00:56:21.845
And in particular, this is
known as the ally effect,

00:56:21.845 --> 00:56:24.960
and we'll spend time talking
about this in a few weeks

00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:27.550
as well in the context of
populations and ecology.

00:56:27.550 --> 00:56:32.360
For now, I just want to use this
as an example of a model that

00:56:32.360 --> 00:56:35.435
gives you these Turing patterns.

00:56:41.367 --> 00:56:43.450
So if you want to, you can
go ahead and ask, well,

00:56:43.450 --> 00:56:46.600
what happens if we just
have a well mixed situation?

00:56:46.600 --> 00:56:50.030
If everything is not a
function of x, but it's still

00:56:50.030 --> 00:56:51.370
can to be a function of time.

00:56:51.370 --> 00:56:53.030
You can solve these
equations, and you

00:56:53.030 --> 00:56:56.150
can find what the steady
states are equal to.

00:56:56.150 --> 00:57:00.110
So there is indeed a steady
state stable coexistence

00:57:00.110 --> 00:57:04.260
of the predator and the prey
in a well mixed situation.

00:57:09.950 --> 00:57:12.070
However, if you then
go and you analyze

00:57:12.070 --> 00:57:16.240
the stability of different
spatial modes, what you'll find

00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:20.570
is that in some situations,
particular wavelength or wave

00:57:20.570 --> 00:57:23.650
vectors become unstable.

00:57:23.650 --> 00:57:26.050
And it's just over some
range of wavelengths,

00:57:26.050 --> 00:57:29.340
and that corresponds to the wave
length of the Turing patterns

00:57:29.340 --> 00:57:30.290
that you'll see.

00:57:30.290 --> 00:57:32.640
If you're curious about
these things in more depth,

00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:37.410
I encourage you to attend Mehran
Kardar's class Statistical

00:57:37.410 --> 00:57:40.790
Physics in Biology, he is
an expert on these topics

00:57:40.790 --> 00:57:44.115
and I think is a
wonderful clear lecturer.

00:57:49.410 --> 00:57:55.400
Now there's going to be some
condition for these things

00:57:55.400 --> 00:57:56.890
leading to Turing patterns.

00:58:00.500 --> 00:58:05.420
Now from your reading, do you
think it's going to be mu--?

00:58:19.130 --> 00:58:31.620
So this is Turing patterns
require-- I'll give you

00:58:31.620 --> 00:58:33.130
30 seconds to think about what.

00:58:48.620 --> 00:58:50.260
Do you need more time?

00:58:50.260 --> 00:58:51.360
I'm not sure where we are.

00:58:54.050 --> 00:58:55.871
Maybe another 15
seconds just to--

00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:18.450
Let's see where we are.

00:59:18.450 --> 00:59:21.710
Ready three, two, one.

00:59:24.650 --> 00:59:27.460
OK, we're all over the place.

00:59:27.460 --> 00:59:30.940
I think we're uniformly
distributed between A, B,

00:59:30.940 --> 00:59:34.490
and C. So there's
an idea that you're

00:59:34.490 --> 00:59:37.670
supposed to have
so-called local activation

00:59:37.670 --> 00:59:38.715
and global inhibition.

00:59:48.040 --> 00:59:51.240
Why don't we turn to a neighbor
and see if you can figure out

00:59:51.240 --> 00:59:52.734
what's going on.

01:01:21.010 --> 01:01:23.420
OK, why don't we
reconvene, I'm curious

01:01:23.420 --> 01:01:25.440
where you're thinking is.

01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:26.500
Let's go ahead and vote.

01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:29.310
Ready three, two, one.

01:01:32.460 --> 01:01:36.440
OK, so we have many, many C's.

01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:39.105
The idea that some mu has
to be much less the nu.

01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:44.070
Yes.

01:01:44.070 --> 01:01:44.980
I want to make sure.

01:01:49.210 --> 01:01:54.370
All right, mu is telling us
about the diffusion coefficient

01:01:54.370 --> 01:01:57.620
of the prey.

01:01:57.620 --> 01:02:02.580
Nu is the diffusion
coefficient of the predator.

01:02:02.580 --> 01:02:07.990
So what you want is to
have local activation.

01:02:07.990 --> 01:02:11.740
And the thing that's activating
itself is the plankton.

01:02:11.740 --> 01:02:14.740
So you can see that that's like,
for example, psi squared term.

01:02:18.710 --> 01:02:21.450
And from the stand point of a
spatial situation, you can say,

01:02:21.450 --> 01:02:23.720
all right, well, let's
say we have some region

01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:25.580
with a lot of this prey.

01:02:25.580 --> 01:02:28.340
Well, it's able to activate
itself, so it kind of comes up.

01:02:28.340 --> 01:02:33.610
And as it does that, it is
creating more of the predator,

01:02:33.610 --> 01:02:34.970
phi.

01:02:34.970 --> 01:02:40.024
But because the predator has a
larger diffusion coefficient--

01:02:40.024 --> 01:02:41.690
well, it's obviously
going to grow here.

01:02:41.690 --> 01:02:44.740
But it will also diffuse away.

01:02:44.740 --> 01:02:46.990
And that's this
global inhibition

01:02:46.990 --> 01:02:49.920
of neighboring regions.

01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:52.060
Now of course, these
are just words,

01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:55.170
you have to take it a little
bit of a grain of salt.

01:02:55.170 --> 01:02:59.300
But if you can actually do
this calculation analytically,

01:02:59.300 --> 01:03:02.890
and derive in this
model the condition

01:03:02.890 --> 01:03:07.400
for Turing patterns to emerge
as a function of everything.

01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:12.261
And for example, if
you have b 1/2, p 1.

01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:21.400
So for unity type parameters,
then the requirement

01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:25.050
to get Turing patterns
is that nu over mu

01:03:25.050 --> 01:03:32.555
is the greater than 27.8.

01:03:32.555 --> 01:03:34.180
The key thing though
is that this thing

01:03:34.180 --> 01:03:35.280
is much larger than 1.

01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:41.190
So a general thing that emerges
in these Turing patterns

01:03:41.190 --> 01:03:45.850
is that you need this
so-called inhibiting type

01:03:45.850 --> 01:03:48.400
partner to have a much larger
effective diffusion coefficient

01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:51.900
than the activating partner.

01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:55.930
Now the problem with this
is that this thing is indeed

01:03:55.930 --> 01:04:03.840
much larger than 1, which limits
the overall usefulness of this

01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:04.670
is a mechanism.

01:04:04.670 --> 01:04:11.700
Because if it really is simple
diffusion, how much bigger

01:04:11.700 --> 01:04:15.644
would the-- let's say, low
Reynolds number regime,

01:04:15.644 --> 01:04:17.560
these are just molecules
experience diffusion.

01:04:24.650 --> 01:04:30.320
How much bigger does the--
this is so confusing.

01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:33.550
So this is big and
this is little, right?

01:04:33.550 --> 01:04:43.270
So how much bigger
does the activator--

01:04:43.270 --> 01:04:45.530
they're too many things
to keep track of here.

01:04:45.530 --> 01:04:47.529
It's because I don't have
anything written down.

01:04:47.529 --> 01:04:49.870
So that's the activator.

01:04:49.870 --> 01:04:54.780
So this one's the activator,
and this one's the inhibitor.

01:04:58.920 --> 01:05:01.150
And the inhibitors has
to diffuse much more

01:05:01.150 --> 01:05:03.340
than the activator.

01:05:03.340 --> 01:05:06.106
So the inhibitor has to be much
smaller than the activator.

01:05:06.106 --> 01:05:08.230
OK good, so how much bigger
does the activator have

01:05:08.230 --> 01:05:11.640
to be than the inhibitor
for this to be true?

01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:16.137
Does it scale as this 28
or 28 squared or 28 cubed?

01:05:21.870 --> 01:05:23.210
In terms of radius, how much?

01:05:27.180 --> 01:05:29.730
Scales linearly, remember?

01:05:29.730 --> 01:05:33.150
Einstein equation, you guys had
fun thinking about on the exam.

01:05:33.150 --> 01:05:34.950
KT over gamma.

01:05:34.950 --> 01:05:37.060
This would require, for
example, the activator

01:05:37.060 --> 01:05:40.650
to be 30 times bigger
in terms of radius.

01:05:40.650 --> 01:05:42.720
And the inhibitor,
in order to have this

01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:46.870
emerge just as a result of
diffusion, simple diffusion.

01:05:46.870 --> 01:05:50.650
And that's just
not a typical thing

01:05:50.650 --> 01:05:53.305
for just a range
of protein sizes.

01:05:53.305 --> 01:05:55.180
But you could imagine
putting up various ways

01:05:55.180 --> 01:05:56.570
to make this happen.

01:05:56.570 --> 01:06:00.530
But there is a very nice
development that I mentioned,

01:06:00.530 --> 01:06:04.910
which is that there's another
surprising aspect in these

01:06:04.910 --> 01:06:07.150
problems, which is
that in many cases,

01:06:07.150 --> 01:06:10.410
demographic noise can
lead to patterns-- --

01:06:10.410 --> 01:06:12.480
or maybe you might call
them quasi-patterns.

01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:15.070
But things that, for all
intents and purposes, look

01:06:15.070 --> 01:06:18.870
like some of this
pseudo-periodic.

01:06:23.160 --> 01:06:27.780
So there's a pseudo-Turing
pattern, maybe.

01:06:27.780 --> 01:06:32.340
And indeed, if you
actually do this simulation

01:06:32.340 --> 01:06:36.370
with those parameters
where you do

01:06:36.370 --> 01:06:40.160
the explicit demographic
fluctuations-- i.e.

01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:42.580
you take into account
that this corresponds

01:06:42.580 --> 01:06:45.165
to a prey giving birth.

01:06:45.165 --> 01:06:47.040
This corresponds to a
predator eating a prey,

01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:48.700
random events just
like what we've

01:06:48.700 --> 01:06:52.860
done in the context of
a Gillespie simulation.

01:06:52.860 --> 01:06:58.415
Then what you find is that
with demographic fluctuations

01:06:58.415 --> 01:07:04.730
or demographic noise, then
the condition here nu over mu

01:07:04.730 --> 01:07:08.370
has to be only 2.48.

01:07:08.370 --> 01:07:15.900
And indeed in Butler
and Goldenfeld,

01:07:15.900 --> 01:07:21.140
they derive these things using
field theoretic approaches.

01:07:21.140 --> 01:07:25.781
There was a 2011 paper
and also 2008 or 2009.

01:07:25.781 --> 01:07:27.280
The nice thing here
is that what you

01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:32.020
see is that in the presence of
these demographic noise that

01:07:32.020 --> 01:07:36.910
will be there, the difference
in diffusivity that are required

01:07:36.910 --> 01:07:39.630
is not nearly as large
as when you're thinking

01:07:39.630 --> 01:07:42.495
about the mean field equations.

01:07:52.774 --> 01:07:54.190
Are there any
questions about this

01:07:54.190 --> 01:07:57.717
before we talk about
center fighting in E. coli?

01:07:57.717 --> 01:07:58.262
Yeah.

01:07:58.262 --> 01:07:59.178
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:08:05.974 --> 01:08:07.390
PROFESSOR: OK, now
you're thinking

01:08:07.390 --> 01:08:08.890
about the actual
plankton-herbivore.

01:08:13.230 --> 01:08:16.800
I think there are
many things to say.

01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:19.680
One of them would just be that
maybe the patterns that you

01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:22.090
see between actual plankton
and actual herbivores

01:08:22.090 --> 01:08:23.660
is not due to the
Turing mechanism.

01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:32.950
For the Turing
mechanism to be at play

01:08:32.950 --> 01:08:37.550
to generate spatial
patterns, it requires

01:08:37.550 --> 01:08:42.281
that this inhibitor do
something equivalent

01:08:42.281 --> 01:08:43.364
to diffusion more rapidly.

01:08:43.364 --> 01:08:46.549
It has to have to move
away more rapidly.

01:08:46.549 --> 01:08:47.830
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:08:47.830 --> 01:08:50.029
PROFESSOR: Right.

01:08:50.029 --> 01:08:53.060
It could be on the plankton only
move around on the currents,

01:08:53.060 --> 01:08:55.644
whereas the herbivore
actually has direct motions.

01:08:55.644 --> 01:08:58.060
I have to say, I don't actually
know enough about plankton

01:08:58.060 --> 01:09:01.766
to know whether this is at
all-- That base statement I thin

01:09:01.766 --> 01:09:05.729
is true, but I don't know
how the numbers work out.

01:09:05.729 --> 01:09:06.229
Yeah.

01:09:06.229 --> 01:09:07.145
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:09:10.670 --> 01:09:12.560
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:16.290
Both in this case and the simple
predator-prey oscillations.

01:09:18.554 --> 01:09:20.970
One thing we're going to see
the predator-prey populations

01:09:20.970 --> 01:09:23.630
later is that you can also
get this sort of oscillations

01:09:23.630 --> 01:09:24.630
in time.

01:09:24.630 --> 01:09:28.319
So this could be in time or this
could be a function of space.

01:09:28.319 --> 01:09:30.149
But in both cases,
it's really that you

01:09:30.149 --> 01:09:34.090
have a resonant
enhancement in some areas.

01:09:34.090 --> 01:09:36.250
So that the demographic
fluctuation somehow

01:09:36.250 --> 01:09:40.840
excite all frequencies
or all wavelengths.

01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:43.870
But then what happens
is that, in this case,

01:09:43.870 --> 01:09:49.975
if you look at the eigenvalues--
OK, I want to be close to 0,

01:09:49.975 --> 01:09:50.474
though.

01:09:54.040 --> 01:09:56.290
If you look at how
the modes decay--

01:09:56.290 --> 01:10:00.260
so the eigenvalue's function
of a wave number-- what you see

01:10:00.260 --> 01:10:02.900
is that you end up getting
things that look like this.

01:10:02.900 --> 01:10:05.680
So whereas a Turing
pattern is when

01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:08.420
particular wave
length or wave modes

01:10:08.420 --> 01:10:12.180
actually becomes
unstable, and then you

01:10:12.180 --> 01:10:13.850
get mean field type patterns.

01:10:13.850 --> 01:10:15.840
And in this situation
what happens

01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:20.110
is that you're just close here,
so then you excite all the wave

01:10:20.110 --> 01:10:21.390
numbers or wavelengths.

01:10:21.390 --> 01:10:23.740
And then some of them take
a long time to go away,

01:10:23.740 --> 01:10:26.360
so then they build up and then
that's the resulting patterns

01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:27.821
that you see.

01:10:33.190 --> 01:10:35.440
So what I want to do is
just for the last 10 minutes

01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:37.520
to talk about this Min system.

01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:39.520
Because it's I think
it's a beautiful example

01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:43.780
of a combination of Systems
Biology questions together

01:10:43.780 --> 01:10:46.440
with reaction diffusion
systems, and also

01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:48.240
some beautiful in
vitro experiments

01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:53.130
that I've quite appreciated.

01:10:53.130 --> 01:10:55.660
So the question is--
imagine yourself,

01:10:55.660 --> 01:10:58.080
you've gone to all this work
right, so now you're nice

01:10:58.080 --> 01:10:59.070
and long.

01:10:59.070 --> 01:11:00.960
So you'd like to
divide into two cells.

01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:03.168
And the question is, how do
you know where to divide?

01:11:06.350 --> 01:11:10.890
So you imagine that
you're some E. coli cell.

01:11:10.890 --> 01:11:16.320
You're maybe six microns
long, everything is great.

01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:19.650
And the question is,
you want to divide?

01:11:19.650 --> 01:11:22.260
Where would you like to divide
if you're an E. coli cell?

01:11:22.260 --> 01:11:22.760
Middle.

01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:25.890
OK, so what you'd
like to do is go here.

01:11:25.890 --> 01:11:30.300
And indeed, what happens is that
there's the so-called z-ring.

01:11:30.300 --> 01:11:32.420
There's a a
pseudo-polymer protein

01:11:32.420 --> 01:11:33.946
that forms a ring
around here, then

01:11:33.946 --> 01:11:38.120
it constricts itself and
pinches off the membrane.

01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:40.250
And that's how
you get two cells.

01:11:40.250 --> 01:11:43.220
So there's this
formation of this z-ring

01:11:43.220 --> 01:11:47.480
that constricts and that's
this cell division event.

01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:50.960
The question is how do
you know where to put it?

01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:54.360
And that's what this
Min system is for.

01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:56.900
And it's, of course,
like everything

01:11:56.900 --> 01:12:01.460
in bacterial genetics, it
was identify by mutations.

01:12:05.030 --> 01:12:11.790
So the Min system it's called
that because these mutants

01:12:11.790 --> 01:12:13.370
formed so-called mini cells.

01:12:18.150 --> 01:12:21.560
If you, instead of
dividing the center where

01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:24.520
you might have two copies
of the genome here.

01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:26.770
If instead you divide
over here, then what

01:12:26.770 --> 01:12:28.810
your going to end up
with is a very long cell

01:12:28.810 --> 01:12:31.220
with two copies of the genome.

01:12:31.220 --> 01:12:35.290
You're going to end up with
this mini cell without any DNA.

01:12:35.290 --> 01:12:37.520
And those mini
cells, are they going

01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:40.120
to do well for the long term?

01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:41.060
AUDIENCE: No.

01:12:41.060 --> 01:12:42.000
PROFESSOR: Right.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.430
They actually can
survive for a little bi.

01:12:44.430 --> 01:12:46.830
And people have argued
that maybe that could

01:12:46.830 --> 01:12:49.897
be useful for synthetic
biology because they still

01:12:49.897 --> 01:12:52.480
make proteins, but they're not
going to go take over the world

01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:54.790
because they don't have any DNA.

01:12:54.790 --> 01:12:57.140
But these are the
so-called mini cells

01:12:57.140 --> 01:13:02.380
that happen if you have
mutations in The min system.

01:13:02.380 --> 01:13:08.750
Now, I think the three players
are MinC, MinD, and MinE.

01:13:16.660 --> 01:13:20.080
So I think that MinA and MinB
ended up not actually existing

01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:22.970
or something, in the sense that
they identified the mutants,

01:13:22.970 --> 01:13:25.290
but then they were
wrong about something.

01:13:25.290 --> 01:13:27.720
So the three that
actually ended up

01:13:27.720 --> 01:13:30.640
being involved in the actual
Min system are C, D and E.

01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:35.606
So this MinC prevents
formation of the z-ring.

01:13:43.550 --> 01:13:46.890
Now MinD and MinE are
kind of the amazing guys.

01:13:46.890 --> 01:13:54.070
So this guy binds to the
membrane and recruits MinC.

01:14:01.930 --> 01:14:09.430
Whereas MinE-- what it does is
it pulls MinD off the membrane.

01:14:09.430 --> 01:14:15.800
So it binds to MinD and
ejects from the membrane.

01:14:22.710 --> 01:14:28.020
And what has been seen by doing
imaging in live E. coli cells

01:14:28.020 --> 01:14:31.040
with fluorescently
labeled MinD and MinE

01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:35.540
is that there are remarkable
oscillations from pole to pole.

01:14:35.540 --> 01:14:37.940
And indeed, that
doesn't require MinC,

01:14:37.940 --> 01:14:39.740
so MinC is somehow
following the others.

01:14:39.740 --> 01:14:43.420
What happens is that
MinD binds over here,

01:14:43.420 --> 01:14:46.300
then MinE binds
and pushes it off.

01:14:46.300 --> 01:14:48.110
And then the MinD
comes over here,

01:14:48.110 --> 01:14:52.140
and then MinE pulls it off,
and it goes back and forth.

01:14:52.140 --> 01:14:56.220
The period is minutes, maybe.

01:14:58.920 --> 01:15:03.600
So it's a really remarkable
thing that happens in vivo.

01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:07.060
And the idea of what's happening
is that if MinD comes here

01:15:07.060 --> 01:15:09.240
and then it comes here,
on each of the edges,

01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:11.670
then it doesn't hang
out in the middle.

01:15:11.670 --> 01:15:16.080
And that means that it's only in
the middle where MinC can then

01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:20.150
bind-- oh, sorry.

01:15:20.150 --> 01:15:22.860
Because MinC is following
MinD, then only in the middle

01:15:22.860 --> 01:15:25.750
can you form the z-ring, because
that's where MinC is not.

01:15:25.750 --> 01:15:26.250
Right.

01:15:30.450 --> 01:15:32.170
It's wonderful to do
things in live cells

01:15:32.170 --> 01:15:34.866
because that's the native
context and so forth.

01:15:34.866 --> 01:15:36.990
But I think that in some
cases, it's also wonderful

01:15:36.990 --> 01:15:39.370
if you can take
purified components

01:15:39.370 --> 01:15:42.980
and recapitulate interesting
behaviors in vitro.

01:15:42.980 --> 01:15:45.131
Because then at
least you know what

01:15:45.131 --> 01:15:51.360
is sufficient to generate
a particular kind

01:15:51.360 --> 01:15:52.890
of dynamical behavior.

01:15:52.890 --> 01:15:55.155
And because this system
had been proposes

01:15:55.155 --> 01:15:59.040
as a model system for
reaction diffusion mechanism

01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:00.360
to get this behavior.

01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:03.800
And so there's this
paper by Martin Loose,

01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:09.610
in Petra Schwille's
lab in-- where was it?

01:16:09.610 --> 01:16:12.660
In Dresden.

01:16:12.660 --> 01:16:15.990
And what they did is they took
a supported lipid bilayer-- so

01:16:15.990 --> 01:16:19.240
a membrane on
glass-- and then they

01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:23.110
added purified components
of MinD and MinE

01:16:23.110 --> 01:16:24.810
that were fluorescently labeled.

01:16:24.810 --> 01:16:28.580
And then they saw
amazing patterns,

01:16:28.580 --> 01:16:32.959
these amazing reaction
diffusion waves traveling along.

01:16:32.959 --> 01:16:34.750
Now on the first day
of lecture, I actually

01:16:34.750 --> 01:16:38.780
showed you what some of
those things look like.

01:16:38.780 --> 01:16:42.270
I didn't want to use
up the projector again,

01:16:42.270 --> 01:16:44.580
but maybe I can
pull up this movie

01:16:44.580 --> 01:16:47.730
because it is kind of fabulous.

01:16:47.730 --> 01:16:50.590
So maybe you can't see
these things very well.

01:16:50.590 --> 01:16:57.640
But this is a MinD and MinE
and an overlay of the two,

01:16:57.640 --> 01:17:01.790
imaged on a two
dimensional membrane.

01:17:01.790 --> 01:17:04.580
And the movies are just amazing.

01:17:04.580 --> 01:17:07.160
When you see this, you think
that it's a simulation.

01:17:07.160 --> 01:17:10.250
It's so incredible
watching these things go.

01:17:10.250 --> 01:17:12.720
After class, you can come
up, I can show you the paper,

01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:16.510
and you can look at the
movie in more depth.

01:17:16.510 --> 01:17:19.330
But they're really
amazing patterns,

01:17:19.330 --> 01:17:21.330
and it's patterns
that you would predict

01:17:21.330 --> 01:17:23.845
from some sort of Turing type
reaction diffusion mechanism.

01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:31.140
So there are few things
that are may be worth

01:17:31.140 --> 01:17:32.500
saying in this business.

01:17:32.500 --> 01:17:36.260
So these are fluorescently
labeled MinD, MinE.

01:17:36.260 --> 01:17:39.036
They started out with
MinD that was uniform.

01:17:39.036 --> 01:17:41.077
And then they added MinE,
and over the time scale

01:17:41.077 --> 01:17:43.770
of about an hour they started
seeing these sorts of patterns.

01:17:46.460 --> 01:17:51.150
And as maybe you expected
from the in vivo behavior,

01:17:51.150 --> 01:17:59.430
what you see are these things
where MinD looks like this,

01:17:59.430 --> 01:18:05.270
whereas MinE looks like that.

01:18:05.270 --> 01:18:08.460
And then the wave
travels here to the left.

01:18:08.460 --> 01:18:12.780
Because the MinE is ejecting
the MinD from the membrane,

01:18:12.780 --> 01:18:17.060
causing this whole
thing to move.

01:18:17.060 --> 01:18:19.180
So this is a situation
where you have

01:18:19.180 --> 01:18:22.570
both of these proteins
in the liquid.

01:18:22.570 --> 01:18:25.440
All right, so in buffer, as well
as on the membrane and they're

01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:28.020
coming on and off and so forth.

01:18:28.020 --> 01:18:30.060
And in this situation,
it's wonderful

01:18:30.060 --> 01:18:32.360
because they can do all
sorts of things like control

01:18:32.360 --> 01:18:34.560
the concentration
of MinE, and see

01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:37.920
that the velocity of
these waves changes as you

01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:39.480
change concentration in MinE.

01:18:39.480 --> 01:18:40.860
So this is a really
experimentally trackable

01:18:40.860 --> 01:18:41.430
system.

01:18:41.430 --> 01:18:43.750
And then you can ask
what kind of model

01:18:43.750 --> 01:18:45.250
would lead to that
sort of behavior?

01:18:49.160 --> 01:18:51.790
Such waves, do you think
that it requires ATP?

01:19:00.820 --> 01:19:03.540
Just for fun, we can vote
yes or no, it's all right.

01:19:03.540 --> 01:19:05.486
Ready three, two, one.

01:19:05.486 --> 01:19:06.134
AUDIENCE: Yes.

01:19:06.134 --> 01:19:06.800
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:08.600
So indeed it does require ATP.

01:19:14.680 --> 01:19:18.550
And that's a general
feature of these Turing type

01:19:18.550 --> 01:19:22.277
patterns is that there is
a non-equilibrium structure

01:19:22.277 --> 01:19:22.776
formation.

01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:31.810
Now one nice thing you can
do in this sort of system

01:19:31.810 --> 01:19:33.435
is you can ask, well,
what happens if I

01:19:33.435 --> 01:19:36.310
photo bleach a particular area?

01:19:36.310 --> 01:19:37.680
So I come in and I photo bleach.

01:19:37.680 --> 01:19:43.860
So now the profile
looks like-- I locally

01:19:43.860 --> 01:19:48.160
deplete the fluorescence here.

01:19:48.160 --> 01:19:51.860
Question is, will this move
together with the traveling

01:19:51.860 --> 01:19:54.280
wave, or does it stay fixed?

01:19:56.960 --> 01:19:59.830
And in these mechanisms, do
you think should this locally

01:19:59.830 --> 01:20:02.696
depleted area, should it move
or should it stay where it is?

01:20:02.696 --> 01:20:03.987
Do you understand the question?

01:20:06.930 --> 01:20:07.960
Move, yes/no.

01:20:07.960 --> 01:20:10.044
Ready three, two, one.

01:20:10.044 --> 01:20:10.960
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:20:14.320 --> 01:20:17.430
PROFESSOR: It
actually doesn't move.

01:20:17.430 --> 01:20:19.336
Depleted area doesn't move.

01:20:27.070 --> 01:20:29.650
And this is just a reflection.

01:20:29.650 --> 01:20:33.032
These waves are not the result
of individual molecules moving

01:20:33.032 --> 01:20:33.990
together with the wave.

01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:41.130
A wave like what you see in
the ocean, or on a stream,

01:20:41.130 --> 01:20:41.940
or what not.

01:20:41.940 --> 01:20:48.657
So the motion is a result of
the individual molecules coming

01:20:48.657 --> 01:20:50.490
and going and communicating
with each other,

01:20:50.490 --> 01:20:53.270
but it's not a reflection
of actual molecules

01:20:53.270 --> 01:20:55.210
having directed motion.

01:20:55.210 --> 01:20:58.580
Because indeed,
there's no mechanism

01:20:58.580 --> 01:21:02.070
in these models for
directed motion.

01:21:02.070 --> 01:21:05.700
What you see is that
in all these models,

01:21:05.700 --> 01:21:11.070
the only thing that is
a function of position

01:21:11.070 --> 01:21:12.760
is diffusion terms.

01:21:12.760 --> 01:21:18.070
So it's all random diffusion,
but then you get global motion.
