00:00:20.482 --> 00:00:22.690
PROFESSOR: So yeah, but
today, what we're going to do

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:24.590
is talk about evolution.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.340
And in particular,
we're going to complete

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.750
our discussion of
evolution in the presence

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.440
of clonal interference when
multiple mutant lineages are

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.640
competing in the
population a the same time.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.320
And then, we'll move
on to try to think

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.850
about evolution on these
so-called rugged fitness

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.290
landscapes.

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.750
So such ruggedness
occurs when there

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.025
are interactions between the
mutations within the organism.

00:00:45.025 --> 00:00:47.560
So a so-called
epistatic interactions

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.070
can, perhaps, constrain
the path of evolution.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.566
So we'll complete our discussion
of Roy Kashoney's paper

00:00:54.566 --> 00:00:56.440
on the equivalence
principle and the presence

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.730
of clonal interference.

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.390
Then we'll say something about
how clonal interference slows

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:02.565
down the rate of evolution.

00:01:02.565 --> 00:01:06.700
It slows down the rate at which
the population can increase

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.760
in fitness because
of this competition

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.640
between different
beneficial lineages.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.280
And then, we'll
discuss this paper

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.790
by Daniel Weinreich,
which I think,

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.120
for many of us, had a
real important effect

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.950
in just terms of getting
us to think about evolution

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.100
in a different way.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.826
Any questions before?

00:01:29.826 --> 00:01:30.325
Yes.

00:01:30.325 --> 00:01:32.116
AUDIENCE: Question
about the exam.

00:01:32.116 --> 00:01:33.580
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.570
In case you've
tried to forget, we

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.370
have an exam again next week.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.680
So research and
education indicates that

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.080
the more exams, the better.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.200
So if that makes you feel any
better in terms of process,

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.510
then use that.

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:57.210
So next Thursday, 7 o'clock, we
will announce the room later.

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.028
Did you have a
question about that?

00:01:59.028 --> 00:02:01.370
AUDIENCE: Is it everything
from the start or [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.500
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so it will be
weighted towards the material

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.190
that we did not test
through exam one.

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.160
But you can expect to
get two plus or minus

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.520
1 questions on material
that was covered

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.720
in the first part of the class.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:20.220
OK.

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.053
Any other questions?

00:02:24.236 --> 00:02:27.160
OK.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.500
All right, so coming
back to this discussion

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.780
of the equivalence principle.

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:42.360
So the last figure of the
paper-- it's a figure of four--

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:48.262
illustrated some alternative
underlying distribution.

00:02:48.262 --> 00:02:49.970
So what we wanted to
know is-- all right,

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.100
so they're going to be
some beneficial mutations

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.117
that these E.coli can get
in this new environment.

00:02:56.117 --> 00:02:58.700
And they're going to distributed
according to some probability

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:59.762
distribution.

00:02:59.762 --> 00:03:01.345
So what we, in
principle, want to know

00:03:01.345 --> 00:03:04.300
is this distribution of effects
of beneficial mutations.

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.360
So the probability of
distribution, P beneficial,

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.940
is a function of s.

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.410
And what was, kind of, the
scale of beneficial mutations

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:19.246
that they observe in the paper.

00:03:19.246 --> 00:03:21.760
All right, how much
better do the populations

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.075
get after these few
100 generations?

00:03:27.196 --> 00:03:27.695
Hm?

00:03:27.695 --> 00:03:28.610
AUDIENCE: 1%.

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.609
PROFESSOR: All right, so
[? order of ?] percent.

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:32.870
A few percent, right?

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:33.440
Precisely.

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.570
And indeed, they had
three different models

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.437
for some of the
underlying distributions

00:03:38.437 --> 00:03:39.520
and how they might behave.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.827
So they had the exponential
uniform and the [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:43.827 --> 00:03:44.785
kind of delta function.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.490
And in all these
cases, are those

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:56.190
the only three possible
underlying distributions?

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.620
Those are just, kind of,
typical distributions.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.712
What you want, in this case,
is you want these three degree

00:04:01.712 --> 00:04:03.920
distributions to, somehow,
be qualitatively different

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.290
so you can drive home
the point that you

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.430
can, in principle, describe
the results of their evolution

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:15.020
experiment via wildly different
underlying distributions.

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:16.240
OK.

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:21.380
Now in all these cases,
you have to specify

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:30.582
the mutation rate, as well as
the mean selection coefficient.

00:04:30.582 --> 00:04:32.550
All right, so the mean
of this distribution.

00:04:45.684 --> 00:04:50.110
OK, now the question is, can
we get any intuitive insight

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.040
into why there were the patterns
that they observe in terms

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.407
of the mutation rate
that they had to assume

00:04:56.407 --> 00:04:57.865
and the mean
selection coefficient.

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:03.110
There were some region of
parameter space for those two

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.809
distributions, for each of those
distributions, that were, kind

00:05:05.809 --> 00:05:07.100
of, consistent with their data.

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:14.160
So in particular, there
was a mutation rate-- mu--

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:19.206
for the exponential
distribution,

00:05:19.206 --> 00:05:25.270
a mutation rate for the
uniform, and a mutation rate

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:30.290
for the delta function.

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:36.440
And also, there was
a mean s associated

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:42.960
with the exponential,
mean s for the uniform

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:48.275
and, again, a mean
s for the delta.

00:05:48.275 --> 00:05:53.032
AUDIENCE: Were they trying to
minimize the parameter numbers?

00:05:53.032 --> 00:05:53.740
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:57.750
OK, so in this case, they
wanted to compare these three

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:59.590
distributions.

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:03.370
Each of them were specified
by two parameters.

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:05.835
You could come up with other
underlying distributions that

00:06:05.835 --> 00:06:07.210
might, for example,
have a larger

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:09.751
number that might be specified
by a larger number parameters.

00:06:09.751 --> 00:06:12.140
But then, it's harder to
compare the quality of the fit

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:12.770
and so forth.

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:15.580
So they chose these
three distributions

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:17.410
just because this
is, somehow, the rate

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:19.830
that these new mutations will
appear in the population.

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:22.260
And then, this tells us
something about how good

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:23.296
those mutations are.

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:28.530
Right.

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:34.300
Now some of you have the
paper in front of you.

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:35.760
And that's OK.

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:41.620
But based on our understanding
of how the clonal interference,

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:44.510
kind of, manifests itself
in terms of leading,

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:48.110
eventually, they have
the log of the fraction.

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:54.320
So the fraction
starts out 50-50.

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.530
Log F1 over F2.

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:59.390
So like, cyan and yellow, say?

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:00.220
All right.

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:01.680
So this thing starts out here.

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.340
And then, one side gets
beneficial mutation.

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:05.610
So it, kind of, comes up.

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:09.800
So they measure the
slope, for example,

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:14.270
of the lineage that is
taking over the population.

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:19.130
So they want to know, well,
which of these distributions

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:20.760
and associated
parameters will be

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:24.210
able to explain the range
of different trajectories

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:25.110
that they saw?

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:40.340
So the question is, can
we order these things?

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:41.000
And why?

00:07:48.251 --> 00:07:49.750
All right, which
one of these should

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:53.340
be the largest, second largest,
third largest, and so forth?

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:55.130
OK.

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:59.006
Now it's OK if you
just-- well, if you

00:07:59.006 --> 00:08:01.710
had the paper in front of you,
you could just read it off.

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:02.726
But ultimately,
you're going to have

00:08:02.726 --> 00:08:04.392
to be able to explain
why it is that one

00:08:04.392 --> 00:08:07.034
is larger than the other.

00:08:07.034 --> 00:08:08.938
OK?

00:08:08.938 --> 00:08:14.610
So what I want to know is, for
example, at what order should

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:15.795
these things come in?

00:08:15.795 --> 00:08:16.320
All right.

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:21.250
So what I want to do is let you
think about it for a minute.

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:23.110
And then, we're going
to vote by putting

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:26.050
our cards from
high mutation rate

00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:31.550
to low mutation rate
among a, b, and c.

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:32.332
Yes?

00:08:32.332 --> 00:08:34.592
AUDIENCE: So the means are
constrained to be the same?

00:08:37.377 --> 00:08:39.960
PROFESSOR: So it's really going
to be some range of parameters

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:41.020
on each of these.

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:43.809
So the question is, why is it
that in the range of parameters

00:08:43.809 --> 00:08:45.335
that are consistent with what
they observe experimentally,

00:08:45.335 --> 00:08:47.190
that these things
have some order?

00:09:03.479 --> 00:09:05.520
Are there any other
questions about the question?

00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:15.970
I'll give you 30
seconds to think

00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:17.820
about what the
mutation rate should,

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:19.445
kind of, be in this situation.

00:09:28.606 --> 00:09:31.442
AUDIENCE: The answer is highest
to lowest mutation rate.

00:09:31.442 --> 00:09:32.150
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:35.060
So you're going to put the
highest mutation rate up high,

00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:37.270
the lowest mutation
rate down there,

00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:38.800
and the middle one in between.

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:39.300
Yeah.

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:24.170
All right.

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:25.150
Do you need more time?

00:10:27.778 --> 00:10:30.890
All right, let's
see where we are.

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:34.300
And it's OK if you're
confused or don't

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:35.485
know what I'm trying to ask.

00:10:35.485 --> 00:10:38.011
But let me see
where the group is.

00:10:38.011 --> 00:10:38.510
Ready?

00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:42.870
Three, two, one.

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:43.410
All right.

00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:48.170
So I would say it's, pretty
much, all over the place,

00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:51.270
whether people are voting
something in reality or not.

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:54.840
OK, right.

00:10:54.840 --> 00:11:01.819
So the situation is that
we have the data, which

00:11:01.819 --> 00:11:04.360
is shown in figure 3A, which is
a bunch of these things that,

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:05.360
kind of, look like this.

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:11.195
All right.

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:17.410
So we have some times.

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:19.500
We have some slopes.

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:23.250
We want to know how can
we understand that data

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:24.138
that we get out.

00:11:27.074 --> 00:11:28.490
So what we're going
to do is we're

00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:30.040
going to take a model
in which we say,

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:32.498
all right, we're going to start
with this population that's

00:11:32.498 --> 00:11:33.230
all identical.

00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:38.720
And then, we're going to allow
some mutations to accumulate.

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:41.730
And we're going to let them
compete against each other.

00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:45.154
And then, see what
happens to the other.

00:11:45.154 --> 00:11:47.570
So there's going to be some,
again, distribution of slopes

00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:48.970
and so forth.

00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:49.470
All right.

00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:51.450
To what degree does
this sort of data

00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:56.280
constrain that
underlying distribution?

00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:59.920
Between something that
looks like an exponential,

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:03.060
something that has a
uniform distribution,

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:06.220
and something that
is a delta function.

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:12.031
So that's the exponential.

00:12:12.031 --> 00:12:12.780
This is the delta.

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:13.780
And this is the uniform.

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:22.145
Yeah.

00:12:22.145 --> 00:12:25.610
AUDIENCE: So we measure the
slope at what time [INAUDIBLE]?

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:30.959
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it could.

00:12:30.959 --> 00:12:31.500
That's right.

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:35.790
So this thing could turn
around at various times.

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:39.864
So I think that there are
a number of different ways

00:12:39.864 --> 00:12:42.030
that you could argue about
the right way to do this.

00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:43.488
In practice, I
think it's not going

00:12:43.488 --> 00:12:47.590
to be very sensitive because
there's a minority of them that

00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:50.850
will actually be turning
around, for example.

00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:53.054
So you could, for
example, just say

00:12:53.054 --> 00:12:54.970
all of the trajectories
that cross some point,

00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:56.180
I mean, measure the slope.

00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:59.760
And I think that
would be sufficient.

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:07.110
AUDIENCE: But if you don't
see this fraction turn over,

00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:09.226
you could still have
clonal interference?

00:13:09.226 --> 00:13:11.230
PROFESSOR: If you
don't see the fraction.

00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:11.855
AUDIENCE: Like, in the sense--

00:13:11.855 --> 00:13:12.854
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:13:12.854 --> 00:13:17.100
So even if you don't see these
things like, the flatten out,

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:20.870
for example, then you could
still have clonal interference

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:23.270
because the slope
might still be steeper

00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:25.880
than it would be in the
absence of clonal interference.

00:13:39.154 --> 00:13:40.570
All right, what
I'm going to do is

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:44.140
I'm going to let you discuss
with a neighbor for one minute.

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:45.989
And then, we'll, maybe,
discuss as a group

00:13:45.989 --> 00:13:48.530
just because I want to make sure
that everybody gets a chance

00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:52.250
to try and verbalize
their thought process.

00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:55.219
And if we discuss in a group,
then only a few of us get to.

00:13:55.219 --> 00:13:56.260
All right, so one minute.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:57.890
Try to discuss it
with your neighbor.

00:13:57.890 --> 00:14:00.256
And then we'll reconvene.

00:14:00.256 --> 00:14:03.742
[SIDE CONVERSATIONS]

00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:54.310
Yeah, and we're going to
discuss the means in a moment.

00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:56.110
So indeed, these
distributions will not

00:15:56.110 --> 00:15:59.110
end up having the same mean s.

00:15:59.110 --> 00:16:01.576
AUDIENCE: What are
you controlling?

00:16:01.576 --> 00:16:02.950
PROFESSOR: What
we're controlling

00:16:02.950 --> 00:16:05.490
is that we're asking
about what range

00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:07.310
of parameters for
each distribution

00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:08.855
will adequately fit the data.

00:16:12.934 --> 00:16:14.368
AUDIENCE: I know [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:16.919 --> 00:16:18.210
Does it depend on what you get?

00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:19.910
PROFESSOR: The data
will be, basically,

00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:23.620
the initial slopes
here and when they

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:25.379
deviated from a 50-50 mixture.

00:16:25.379 --> 00:16:25.920
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:26.850
PROFESSOR: All right, so
that's what [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:27.970
is those histograms.

00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:30.350
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:31.278
OK.

00:16:31.278 --> 00:16:31.778
[INAUDIBLE]

00:16:36.062 --> 00:16:38.880
PROFESSOR: All right, so it
seems like we've quieted down,

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:41.880
which means that we all
agree on the answer.

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:44.200
Is that-- no?

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:47.690
OK, well I think that this
is, actually, pretty tricky.

00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:48.315
So that's fine.

00:16:48.315 --> 00:16:49.981
I just want to see
where we are, though.

00:16:49.981 --> 00:16:50.580
All right.

00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:52.530
Reconfigure your cards.

00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:58.280
Your best guess for the
orders of the mutation rates

00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:01.130
between exponential
uniform and delta.

00:17:01.130 --> 00:17:01.920
All right, ready?

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:03.490
Three, two, one.

00:17:06.619 --> 00:17:12.089
OK, so we're migrating
towards some things.

00:17:12.089 --> 00:17:17.990
OK, great.

00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:26.310
And can somebody verbalize the
answer that their group got?

00:17:33.114 --> 00:17:37.487
AUDIENCE: So our
answer is A, B, and C.

00:17:37.487 --> 00:17:38.070
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:40.450
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
exponential [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:44.734 --> 00:17:53.380
We can not see most
of the [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:57.340
lower selection
coefficient mutations.

00:17:57.340 --> 00:17:58.330
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:17:58.330 --> 00:18:00.805
AUDIENCE: So we're actually
underestimating the mutation

00:18:00.805 --> 00:18:03.775
rate from the data.

00:18:03.775 --> 00:18:05.089
PROFESSOR: Underestimate.

00:18:05.089 --> 00:18:06.630
OK, no, I can see
what you're saying.

00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:08.130
OK, yeah, so the
idea is that you're

00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:10.420
saying that we don't see an
awful lot of the mutations

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:13.550
here, which means
that the true mutation

00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:14.967
rate, the underlying
mutation rate

00:18:14.967 --> 00:18:17.383
is, somehow, much larger than
you would have thought based

00:18:17.383 --> 00:18:20.130
on the mutations that you
actually see here or something.

00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:21.750
And there's maybe another.

00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:23.400
OK, so they're different.

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:26.480
All right.

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:29.339
OK, it's certainly along--
yeah, sometimes it's true.

00:18:29.339 --> 00:18:31.880
And then, of course, there are
different ways of saying this.

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:33.250
Yes?

00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:36.136
AUDIENCE: Yeah, same answer
but a slightly different way

00:18:36.136 --> 00:18:37.010
of thinking about it.

00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:42.912
If you're just randomly sampling
any of these distributions,

00:18:42.912 --> 00:18:49.164
then your sample drawn from
the exponential distribution.

00:18:49.164 --> 00:18:52.918
It's going to be low
selection [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:52.918 --> 00:18:55.084
more often than it's going
to be for the other ones.

00:18:55.084 --> 00:18:56.270
Like the delta is [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:56.520
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:57.228
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:18:57.228 --> 00:18:59.560
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
every time the uniform.

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:04.325
It's going to be equally
likely to be a high selection

00:19:04.325 --> 00:19:06.800
coefficient as opposed to a
low selection coefficient.

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:08.425
But with the exponential
distributions,

00:19:08.425 --> 00:19:10.760
your most likely to be a
low selection coefficient.

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:12.160
So you want more mutations.

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:13.160
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:16.200
You, somehow, need more
mutations of that exponential

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:18.041
in order to sample out there.

00:19:18.041 --> 00:19:18.540
Right?

00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:22.104
So which one is going to have
a more clonal interference?

00:19:22.104 --> 00:19:23.770
Which of these
distributions will end up

00:19:23.770 --> 00:19:25.645
having the most clonal
interference after you

00:19:25.645 --> 00:19:26.930
fit the data?

00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:33.903
Yeah?

00:19:33.903 --> 00:19:34.870
AUDIENCE: The one with
the highest mutation.

00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:37.036
PROFESSOR: The one with the
highest mutation, right?

00:19:37.036 --> 00:19:37.990
Kind of has to.

00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:39.620
Of course, and even though
some of those mutations

00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:40.476
are going to be loss,
still it's going

00:19:40.476 --> 00:19:42.370
to have the most colonel
interference there.

00:19:42.370 --> 00:19:45.540
And indeed, if the
underlying distribution

00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:48.990
were modeling as
a delta function

00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:51.610
and, in their
[? fit ?], what they got

00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:56.580
was that this might be
around 5 and 1/2%, I think.

00:19:59.165 --> 00:20:01.250
Yeah, so [? 5 to 5 and 1/2 ?].

00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:01.750
OK.

00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:09.810
So here, this guy
was around 0.055.

00:20:09.810 --> 00:20:11.110
Between 5 and 5 and 1/2%.

00:20:13.624 --> 00:20:15.540
So what they're saying
is, all right, well you

00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:18.210
could explain all
of our data just

00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:21.930
by assuming that there's
some mutation rate where,

00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:25.420
periodically, some individual
gets a beneficial mutation that

00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:28.420
is a 5, 5 and 1/2%.

00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:30.500
And that could, in
principle, be used

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:34.240
to explain the base
features here, how long have

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:37.310
to wait before anything happens,
and the slope when something

00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:38.840
starts happening.

00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:41.780
So the histogram that they
plot is actually, somehow,

00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:44.380
this initial this initial
slope once you start

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:47.330
seeing it deviate from 50/50.

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:47.830
OK?

00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:48.330
All right.

00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:50.190
But their point is
it that that does not

00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:51.900
prove that the underlying
distribution is

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:54.740
a delta function
with some mutation.

00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:57.210
And indeed, to explain the
data with a delta function,

00:20:57.210 --> 00:21:01.780
you don't actually don't
need any clonal interference.

00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:02.280
Right?

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:04.279
You just say, OK, well
somebody gets a mutation.

00:21:04.279 --> 00:21:05.530
It's 5%.

00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:07.140
And eventually, it's
going to spread.

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:08.830
And that's what we see.

00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:11.350
If you want to explain the
later dynamics of flattening

00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:15.160
out and so forth, then you
have to allow the other lineage

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:18.580
to get a mutations, as
well to cause a flattening.

00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:21.010
But as far as the
base dynamics of when

00:21:21.010 --> 00:21:23.104
you leave the 50-50
in the initial slope,

00:21:23.104 --> 00:21:25.520
you don't even really need to
have any clonal interference

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:30.312
to explain their data with
a delta function underlined.

00:21:30.312 --> 00:21:32.770
And that's why you also can
get by with a very low mutation

00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:34.606
rate because you
don't really need much

00:21:34.606 --> 00:21:35.980
in the way of
competing lineages.

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:40.120
Yeah?

00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:42.564
AUDIENCE: But what if the
slopes are [INAUDIBLE]?

00:21:42.564 --> 00:21:43.480
PROFESSOR: Yeah, yeah.

00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:43.980
No, right.

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:47.510
So you're not actually going
to get the true distribution

00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:48.560
of slopes.

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:52.267
But their argument
is that a lot of that

00:21:52.267 --> 00:21:54.100
could just be noise and
measuring the slopes

00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:56.620
and so forth because, if
everything is a delta function,

00:21:56.620 --> 00:22:00.560
then you would start out
by just getting one slope,

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:02.847
unless you offer multiple
mutations on a lineage.

00:22:02.847 --> 00:22:04.680
And then, things could
get more complicated.

00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:06.340
But yeah.

00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:10.010
In this case, all of these
guys would have the same slope.

00:22:10.010 --> 00:22:14.170
But that's, at least, a
reasonable first order

00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:16.830
approximation to the data.

00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:19.090
However, as you move to these
distributions in uniform

00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:21.649
and exponential, you're going
to need more and more clonal

00:22:21.649 --> 00:22:23.440
interference to, kind
of, explain the data.

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:26.422
So you'll need higher
and higher mutation rate.

00:22:26.422 --> 00:22:27.880
What's interesting
is that you also

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:32.031
have a lower and lower mean s.

00:22:32.031 --> 00:22:32.531
OK?

00:22:36.010 --> 00:22:37.998
AUDIENCE: Can you
just explain why

00:22:37.998 --> 00:22:42.924
you need to explain the data?

00:22:42.924 --> 00:22:43.840
PROFESSOR: Yeah, sure.

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:47.580
And I think that drawing
these underlying distributions

00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:49.250
is really helpful.

00:22:49.250 --> 00:22:52.060
So first, we're going to
draw the delta function.

00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:53.910
That, kind of,
makes sense that you

00:22:53.910 --> 00:22:57.400
can fit everything just by
assuming 5, 5 and 1/2%, right.

00:22:57.400 --> 00:23:02.240
So what we're going to
do is draw the various P.

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:03.810
So I drew those distributions.

00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:06.390
But they weren't
necessarily to scale.

00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:09.520
i.e, they didn't necessarily
have the proper mean selection

00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:11.220
coefficient.

00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:13.380
What we can do
here is we can draw

00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:16.330
this is the mean s of
the delta function, which

00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:18.285
was 5, 5 and 1/2%.

00:23:18.285 --> 00:23:22.350
All right, we got this guy here.

00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:27.190
Now the question
is can we describe

00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:33.480
the data using a
uniform distribution

00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:36.105
with the same mean
selection coefficient?

00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:42.680
All right, so we're going
to have you vote yes and no.

00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:45.260
And if you say no,
then you have to say

00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:46.951
what's going to go wrong.

00:23:46.951 --> 00:23:47.451
All right?

00:23:47.451 --> 00:23:51.550
The question is can we just
use the same mean selection

00:23:51.550 --> 00:23:53.555
coefficient for our
uniform distribution.

00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:57.170
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:00.372 --> 00:24:01.080
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:01.700
So what we're going
to do is we're

00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:04.370
going to measure the
experiment where we would have,

00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:07.289
say, 96 different evolutionary
trajectories where we measure

00:24:07.289 --> 00:24:09.580
the time that it takes for
something to happen and then

00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:10.454
the initial slope.

00:24:10.454 --> 00:24:12.620
And we're going to take a
histogram of those things,

00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:14.170
and compare it
between what we would

00:24:14.170 --> 00:24:16.310
get in the model with what
we got experimentally.

00:24:21.816 --> 00:24:23.190
All right, the
question is can we

00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:26.340
use the same mean
s for a uniform

00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:28.532
as we did for the
delta function.

00:24:28.532 --> 00:24:30.680
And if you say no, you
have to say why not.

00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:31.370
A is yes.

00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:31.880
B is no.

00:24:34.661 --> 00:24:35.160
Ready?

00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:42.074
Three, two, one.

00:24:42.074 --> 00:24:44.220
All right, so we
have a bunch of no's.

00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:45.030
Maybe a few yes's.

00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:48.570
All right but then
some of the no's,

00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:50.104
it's incumbent on
you [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:50.104 --> 00:24:50.770
So I don't know.

00:24:50.770 --> 00:24:54.992
So yes, so one of
the no's, why not?

00:24:54.992 --> 00:24:57.457
AUDIENCE: So if we
have [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:57.457 --> 00:25:00.168
if it has the same
average, then there

00:25:00.168 --> 00:25:02.217
are going to be
outliers that are more

00:25:02.217 --> 00:25:03.931
better for the [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:03.931 --> 00:25:04.930
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:25:04.930 --> 00:25:07.513
So the problem here is that, if
we use the same mean selection

00:25:07.513 --> 00:25:10.500
coefficient pretty
for the uniform,

00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:12.000
then what we're
going to end up with

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.326
is something that
comes out twice as far.

00:25:15.326 --> 00:25:15.951
AUDIENCE: Wait.

00:25:15.951 --> 00:25:19.879
But the delta function is just
a uniform distribution with 0.

00:25:19.879 --> 00:25:20.702
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:25:20.702 --> 00:25:23.160
AUDIENCE: So you could always
just fit it with [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:23.820
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
we're assuming it's

00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:25.380
a uniform distribution
that starts at 0

00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:27.005
and then goes out to
some [? amount ?].

00:25:29.379 --> 00:25:31.560
Yeah.

00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:34.440
So the idea is that--
I mean, whatever.

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:35.330
That's the model.

00:25:35.330 --> 00:25:37.620
And I think it's
a reasonable model

00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:40.350
because we know that there
are a lot of mutations

00:25:40.350 --> 00:25:41.480
that have little effect.

00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:44.670
So it makes sense for a
distribution to start at 0,

00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:47.231
if you're going to have
something like a uniform.

00:25:47.231 --> 00:25:47.730
Right?

00:25:47.730 --> 00:25:50.420
And the problem with such
a uniform distribution

00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:53.564
is that because there's going
to be some clonal interference,

00:25:53.564 --> 00:25:55.730
what that means is that
you're going to be, kind of,

00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:57.270
weighted out here.

00:25:57.270 --> 00:25:58.770
And that means that
you'll, kind of,

00:25:58.770 --> 00:26:01.310
see mutations that are
out here around 10%,

00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:05.050
instead of around 5%.

00:26:05.050 --> 00:26:06.624
So what you actually
want, then, is

00:26:06.624 --> 00:26:08.040
something where
the mean selection

00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:09.760
coefficient is
around half of what

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:11.650
you had as the delta function.

00:26:11.650 --> 00:26:14.180
So you want something that
really looks more like this.

00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:18.785
And that's actually why,
if you look at the data

00:26:18.785 --> 00:26:23.774
or if you look at this
figure, then the area that

00:26:23.774 --> 00:26:25.190
works for the
uniform distribution

00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:27.900
has a mean/coefficient of 3%.

00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:31.120
So this thing comes
out to around 6% here.

00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:37.380
So just beyond the s correspond
to the delta function.

00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:38.650
So this is the delta.

00:26:38.650 --> 00:26:41.470
And this is the uniform.

00:26:41.470 --> 00:26:43.552
So here is around 6%.

00:26:43.552 --> 00:26:45.468
And the mean of this is
[? at half ?] of that.

00:26:45.468 --> 00:26:47.700
Right?

00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:50.420
What's happening is that there's
some clonal interference.

00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:53.450
And you only need a modest
amount of clonal interference

00:26:53.450 --> 00:26:56.120
because if you sample from a
uniform distribution just a few

00:26:56.120 --> 00:27:03.130
then, the most fir one
will be around here.

00:27:03.130 --> 00:27:06.190
And it'll already be
relatively peaked.

00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:08.020
And of course, there's
also this issue

00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:09.978
that you have to survive
stochastic extinction.

00:27:09.978 --> 00:27:12.210
So that amplifies
the effect further.

00:27:12.210 --> 00:27:16.152
So really, if you just have,
say, two mutations sampled

00:27:16.152 --> 00:27:18.360
from the uniform that survives
stochastic extinction,

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:19.960
you're already going
to get something

00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:24.020
that's peaked around there.

00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:25.422
Does that make sense?

00:27:25.422 --> 00:27:25.922
Yeah.

00:27:25.922 --> 00:27:27.463
AUDIENCE: But what
if we [INAUDIBLE]?

00:27:29.709 --> 00:27:32.000
PROFESSOR: So then, the
question is what exact mutation

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:32.740
rate do you need.

00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:38.240
And basically, you need a
high enough mutation rate

00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:40.130
that you get some
mutations and that you can

00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:42.507
have some clonal interference.

00:27:42.507 --> 00:27:44.090
And the question is,
what prevents you

00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:47.980
from having a mutation rate
that's too high, maybe?

00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:51.310
AUDIENCE: My question was why
do you need clonal interference

00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:54.084
to explain the data.

00:27:54.084 --> 00:27:55.920
PROFESSOR: Ah, right.

00:27:55.920 --> 00:28:00.076
AUDIENCE: I mean, of course, you
have these [INAUDIBLE] focused

00:28:00.076 --> 00:28:01.299
on what happened early on.

00:28:01.299 --> 00:28:02.540
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:05.050
Yeah.

00:28:05.050 --> 00:28:05.550
Right, OK.

00:28:05.550 --> 00:28:08.610
So in there it comes
down to how peaked

00:28:08.610 --> 00:28:13.645
this distribution of
slopes is because there

00:28:13.645 --> 00:28:15.625
are very few shallow slopes.

00:28:15.625 --> 00:28:18.000
And of course, then, it gets
into questions about quality

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.370
of data and so forth.

00:28:19.370 --> 00:28:21.120
And that's more subtle.

00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:23.845
But certainly in
principal, in the absence

00:28:23.845 --> 00:28:27.310
of clonal interference, you
would have some fair number

00:28:27.310 --> 00:28:29.654
of shallow slopes.

00:28:29.654 --> 00:28:31.070
It would be under
represented just

00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:33.080
because of the stochastic
extinction business.

00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:36.215
But still, you need some
to explain the, sort of,

00:28:36.215 --> 00:28:38.590
peakiness of that distribution
of the slope distribution.

00:28:42.610 --> 00:28:44.540
Now the exponential
is interesting

00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:48.570
because it's in a very,
very different regime.

00:28:48.570 --> 00:28:54.660
So I just want to show this
is mean s for the uniform.

00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:56.970
And actually, if you
look at the figure

00:28:56.970 --> 00:29:00.140
of the mean s for
the exponential,

00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:05.030
it's down there around
1%, which is a little bit

00:29:05.030 --> 00:29:08.530
surprising because
what this is saying

00:29:08.530 --> 00:29:11.320
is that, if you look
at this distribution,

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:16.350
this initial slope, kind
of, extends down here.

00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:21.130
And you have something
that falls off,

00:29:21.130 --> 00:29:23.710
dramatically, though, right.

00:29:23.710 --> 00:29:24.210
OK.

00:29:24.210 --> 00:29:26.040
So how is it possible
that you could

00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:28.310
use such a distribution
that's peaked over here

00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:31.270
that's so far over on the
left and still explain

00:29:31.270 --> 00:29:32.393
the same data?

00:29:32.393 --> 00:29:33.309
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:35.870 --> 00:29:36.870
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:39.810
So it's true that I've drawn
this, kind of, around 0.

00:29:39.810 --> 00:29:41.470
But the exponential
and principle

00:29:41.470 --> 00:29:41.880
goes to [? infinity ?].

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:43.630
It's just that it falls
off exponentially.

00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:46.490
But what this means is that
you're sampling pretty far

00:29:46.490 --> 00:29:52.500
out on the exponential in order
to get the same mean effect.

00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:55.790
So you're actually going
out to five or six times

00:29:55.790 --> 00:29:57.690
this characteristic s.

00:29:57.690 --> 00:30:00.170
So you're talking
e to the minus 5.

00:30:00.170 --> 00:30:00.760
Right?

00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:02.718
That means there's a lot
of clonal interference

00:30:02.718 --> 00:30:05.530
that has to be happening in
order to explain this, right?

00:30:05.530 --> 00:30:07.500
But why is it that
it's way over here?

00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:10.990
I mean, why not just use an
exponential with an s that's

00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:12.480
more like 3, 4, 5, 6%?

00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:19.120
What's that?

00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:19.620
Well OK.

00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:21.470
But, you know, I mean,
this is just a model.

00:30:21.470 --> 00:30:25.120
I can do whatever I want
because, actually, they fit

00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:26.740
their data with these models.

00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:30.890
So realistic just means
that it explains their data.

00:30:30.890 --> 00:30:33.870
So there's nothing a priori
wrong with saying, oh,

00:30:33.870 --> 00:30:38.270
here's an exponential with a
characteristic fall off of 5%.

00:30:38.270 --> 00:30:40.252
That's, in principle, fine.

00:30:40.252 --> 00:30:41.960
I mean, it doesn't
work, for some reason,

00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:45.240
but we have to figure out why.

00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:45.740
Yeah.

00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:46.690
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:50.440
PROFESSOR: OK, right.

00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:54.852
So you're likely going to get a
low selection coefficient, OK.

00:30:54.852 --> 00:30:55.734
Is that the problem?

00:30:55.734 --> 00:30:56.650
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:03.564 --> 00:31:05.000
PROFESSOR: OK, that's true.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:12.766
But I guess the question
is why can't we use?

00:31:12.766 --> 00:31:15.664
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:15.664 --> 00:31:17.119
PROFESSOR: Two mutations?

00:31:17.119 --> 00:31:17.660
Two clusters?

00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:18.512
What do you mean?

00:31:18.512 --> 00:31:19.496
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:26.384 --> 00:31:28.370
PROFESSOR: OK, the
time between two.

00:31:28.370 --> 00:31:30.460
OK, that's an
interesting statement.

00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:34.610
Although, the region or
parameter space that they claim

00:31:34.610 --> 00:31:38.300
works is actually a region where
we have a really high mutation

00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:39.230
rate.

00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:41.730
Orders of magnitude higher than
the other two distributions.

00:31:41.730 --> 00:31:43.640
So in that sense, the
time between mutations

00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:46.570
being established
is really small

00:31:46.570 --> 00:31:48.444
because they're saying
that, oh, if you

00:31:48.444 --> 00:31:50.110
want to fit the
[INAUDIBLE] exponential,

00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:52.276
then you have to assume
lots of clonal interference.

00:31:52.276 --> 00:31:55.590
So that means the time between
successive establishments

00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:58.560
or mutations is really,
actually, very short.

00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:03.190
So that's actually the regime
where they claim works.

00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:04.690
So the question is
why is it that we

00:32:04.690 --> 00:32:08.074
can't go to this other regime?

00:32:08.074 --> 00:32:09.490
In this figure
that they make, why

00:32:09.490 --> 00:32:13.810
is it that the allowed mean
coefficient doesn't extend out

00:32:13.810 --> 00:32:16.494
to over there?

00:32:16.494 --> 00:32:16.994
Yeah.

00:32:16.994 --> 00:32:17.956
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:24.209 --> 00:32:25.160
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:27.120
AUDIENCE: Because
the exponential is

00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:29.080
[INAUDIBLE] that [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:30.660
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:31.960
Yeah, that's right.

00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:33.940
The point is that, to
explain their data,

00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:36.360
you need something to
cause this distribution

00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:38.340
to get more peaked
over here, which

00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:41.340
means you need to have a fair
amount of clonal interference.

00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:45.510
But that means you need to
have a high mutation rate.

00:32:45.510 --> 00:32:47.260
But once you have that
high mutation rate,

00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:49.090
if you have an exponential
that comes out here,

00:32:49.090 --> 00:32:51.420
then you would actually
sample way out here, as well.

00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:53.742
So the only way to get a
peaks distribution around here

00:32:53.742 --> 00:32:55.700
is to have it so that
the exponential is really

00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:57.790
suppressing those
really good mutations.

00:32:57.790 --> 00:33:01.020
But you have a lot of
clonal interference

00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:03.650
that, kind of, pulls things out.

00:33:03.650 --> 00:33:08.610
Now there still is a fair range
of parameters that work here.

00:33:08.610 --> 00:33:11.390
You know, it goes from,
say, half a percent up

00:33:11.390 --> 00:33:14.676
to, maybe, 1 and 1/2% in
terms of this mean selection

00:33:14.676 --> 00:33:15.670
coefficient.

00:33:15.670 --> 00:33:19.430
And the mutation rate
that works then changes.

00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:22.610
So as you got a larger
mean selection coefficient,

00:33:22.610 --> 00:33:24.610
the mutation rate
that is compatible

00:33:24.610 --> 00:33:27.830
goes down because you need
less clonal interference.

00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:31.550
So that's why, if you look at
this figure for the region that

00:33:31.550 --> 00:33:34.340
works in terms of
the mutation rate

00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:37.900
for the beneficial
mutation and the mean s,

00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:41.890
there's some region that
looks, kind of, like this

00:33:41.890 --> 00:33:43.900
that works for the exponential.

00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:47.010
And this is,
actually, a big range.

00:33:47.010 --> 00:33:51.980
So this is, actually, a
factor of 100 in mutation rate

00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:53.250
that would be compatible.

00:33:53.250 --> 00:33:56.602
And then, a factor of, maybe,
three in mean selection

00:33:56.602 --> 00:33:58.610
coefficient.

00:33:58.610 --> 00:34:00.934
So there's some range
of parameters that work.

00:34:00.934 --> 00:34:03.100
And you can understand why
it is that this thing has

00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:04.420
to be shaped the way it is.

00:34:09.069 --> 00:34:09.944
Does that make sense?

00:34:12.689 --> 00:34:13.677
Yeah.

00:34:13.677 --> 00:34:14.665
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:25.039 --> 00:34:29.239
PROFESSOR: Right because
the uniform is out here.

00:34:29.239 --> 00:34:31.710
And then, the delta
function is here.

00:34:31.710 --> 00:34:36.804
So this is delta,
uniform, and exponential.

00:34:36.804 --> 00:34:39.345
And you're just saying that it
all, [? kind of ?], following.

00:34:39.345 --> 00:34:40.844
Is that-- yeah.

00:34:40.844 --> 00:34:41.838
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:58.180
PROFESSOR: Yeah, well maybe
some power law fall off

00:34:58.180 --> 00:35:01.611
would do that.

00:35:01.611 --> 00:35:03.601
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:03.601 --> 00:35:05.600
PROFESSOR: There's nothing
there's nothing magic

00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:08.280
about these three regions.

00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:12.016
And it's not that we're
claiming that the mean selection

00:35:12.016 --> 00:35:14.157
coefficient cannot be in here.

00:35:14.157 --> 00:35:16.240
It's just that, if you
pick these three underlined

00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:18.450
distributions, you get this
range of different values

00:35:18.450 --> 00:35:19.116
that would work.

00:35:19.116 --> 00:35:21.100
So if you chose other
underlying distributions,

00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:23.380
you could get other blogs.

00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:25.450
But it's true that
there is a general trend

00:35:25.450 --> 00:35:27.610
that, the higher the mean
selection coefficient,

00:35:27.610 --> 00:35:29.750
the less clonal
interference you need

00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:31.821
or want to explain the data.

00:35:31.821 --> 00:35:32.775
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:36.591 --> 00:35:37.330
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:35:37.330 --> 00:35:40.231
Why can't it go higher or lower?

00:35:40.231 --> 00:35:40.730
Yeah.

00:35:43.598 --> 00:35:44.830
I don't know.

00:35:44.830 --> 00:35:47.310
A factor of 100
isn't enough for you?

00:35:47.310 --> 00:35:49.280
Yeah, it's a good question.

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:52.240
I'd have to think about
it to figure out which--

00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:54.740
because there's going to be a
different effect on each side,

00:35:54.740 --> 00:35:55.239
presumably.

00:35:59.310 --> 00:36:01.374
Yeah, and all of
these distributions,

00:36:01.374 --> 00:36:02.790
there's some floor
just because we

00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:06.980
know that you have to get
these beneficial mutations

00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:09.550
within the first few
tens of generations.

00:36:09.550 --> 00:36:12.220
Otherwise, the mutation
wouldn't have gotten a chance

00:36:12.220 --> 00:36:15.240
to spread when it did.

00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:16.670
So that means we
know that there's

00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:18.490
going to be a lower
bound on the mutation

00:36:18.490 --> 00:36:22.590
always because, if
it's too low, then we

00:36:22.590 --> 00:36:24.810
wouldn't have gotten
the mutations in time.

00:36:24.810 --> 00:36:30.817
And now, in terms of why
it can't be higher, yeah,

00:36:30.817 --> 00:36:37.180
I'd have to think about it.

00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:39.280
Are there any other
questions about this paper?

00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:41.190
I think it's a challenging
paper, kind of,

00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:43.860
conceptually/mathematically.

00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:45.900
But I think it's
interesting because it

00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:48.875
does get you to think about this
process of clonal interference

00:36:48.875 --> 00:36:49.375
in new ways.

00:36:53.582 --> 00:36:54.570
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:54.570 --> 00:36:55.558
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:36:55.558 --> 00:36:57.534
AUDIENCE: So is that enough?

00:36:57.534 --> 00:37:03.462
Like, is this condition
rate known [INAUDIBLE]?

00:37:03.462 --> 00:37:04.546
PROFESSOR: Oh, I see.

00:37:04.546 --> 00:37:05.670
Oh, that's a good question.

00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:06.674
Yeah.

00:37:06.674 --> 00:37:08.090
Yeah, so I think
that the mutation

00:37:08.090 --> 00:37:13.730
rates that-- first of all, this
is not a per base pair mutation

00:37:13.730 --> 00:37:14.400
rate.

00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:17.225
This is the rate that you
get beneficial mutations.

00:37:20.180 --> 00:37:23.172
So I'd say, the numbers
are not ridiculous.

00:37:23.172 --> 00:37:24.630
But it's not that
you can just take

00:37:24.630 --> 00:37:28.340
the known per base [? pair of ?]
mutation rate and say, oh, well

00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:31.310
it has to be here because
an awful lot of them

00:37:31.310 --> 00:37:33.660
are deleterious.

00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:35.767
And it's very sensitive
because the mutations that

00:37:35.767 --> 00:37:37.350
are occurring around
here don't really

00:37:37.350 --> 00:37:40.484
matter for evolution because
they tend not to survive

00:37:40.484 --> 00:37:41.400
stochastic extinction.

00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:43.220
They're not going to
survive clonal interference.

00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:44.900
Yet, it could be a big
part of the distribution.

00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:45.399
Right?

00:37:45.399 --> 00:37:48.290
It could be that the majority
of the mutations-- for example,

00:37:48.290 --> 00:37:50.410
in the exponential-- is there.

00:37:50.410 --> 00:37:53.899
So you can actually have
very different distributions

00:37:53.899 --> 00:37:55.940
that don't really change
the evolutionary process

00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:59.330
but would change the rate
of beneficial mutations.

00:37:59.330 --> 00:38:02.209
So I think the numbers
are not ridiculous.

00:38:02.209 --> 00:38:03.750
But it's hard to
constrain, actually.

00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:13.919
What I want to do
is, before talking

00:38:13.919 --> 00:38:15.460
about these rugged
fitness landscapes

00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:18.020
and the Weinreich paper,
let's just say something

00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:21.660
about the rate of evolution.

00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:27.990
And when we say
rate, we're referring

00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:31.266
to the change and the mean
fitness of the population

00:38:31.266 --> 00:38:32.140
with respect to time.

00:38:41.469 --> 00:38:44.850
All right, so this is
the rate of evolution.

00:38:48.170 --> 00:38:52.240
So this is the change
in the mean fitness.

00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:54.220
Delta.

00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:58.700
Delta mean fitness
divided by delta time.

00:39:01.460 --> 00:39:03.025
So what we want to
do is just start

00:39:03.025 --> 00:39:05.780
by thinking about
a situation where

00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:10.060
we assume that we're not all
running out of new mutations

00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:11.090
that are good for us.

00:39:11.090 --> 00:39:14.840
All right, so what we can do is
just assume that, at some rate,

00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:21.580
mu-- so there's at rate
mu beneficial, we'll say.

00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:23.990
We sample from some
probabilities distribution

00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:27.010
of beneficial mutations.

00:39:27.010 --> 00:39:31.300
And then, something happens
to cast an extinction.

00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:33.290
Maybe clonal
interference and whatnot.

00:39:33.290 --> 00:39:34.900
But someone of them will fix.

00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:36.441
And then, that
increases the fitness.

00:39:36.441 --> 00:39:41.180
And then, for now, we'll just
assume that the fitness is add.

00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:42.780
But for small S's,
it doesn't matter

00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:43.730
whether we're thinking
about [? fitness as ?]

00:39:43.730 --> 00:39:45.005
adding or multiplying.

00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:50.300
You guys understand
what I just said there?

00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:57.461
So if you get a mutation
that has affect S1 and maybe

00:39:57.461 --> 00:39:59.210
the right way to think
about this is that,

00:39:59.210 --> 00:40:02.425
if you get a mutation s2, then
the [? fitnesses ?] perhaps ,

00:40:02.425 --> 00:40:04.480
should multiply as
the [? mu ?] model.

00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:06.870
But this is, of course,
for a small s1 and s2,

00:40:06.870 --> 00:40:10.410
this is around 1 plus s2.

00:40:10.410 --> 00:40:12.730
So for small S's for
short times, maybe

00:40:12.730 --> 00:40:18.625
we don't need to worry about
this because this is, for s1

00:40:18.625 --> 00:40:23.271
and s2, much less than 1.

00:40:23.271 --> 00:40:23.770
Yes?

00:40:23.770 --> 00:40:25.936
AUDIENCE: My intuition would
be that, if you already

00:40:25.936 --> 00:40:28.004
had a 5% increase
i [? fitness ?],

00:40:28.004 --> 00:40:29.896
it would be harder
to get [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:29.896 --> 00:40:31.439
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:40:31.439 --> 00:40:33.022
So eventually, that
certainly is going

00:40:33.022 --> 00:40:35.310
to be the case that
we're going to run out

00:40:35.310 --> 00:40:37.560
of these beneficial mutations.

00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:44.440
But for the first few
thousand generations,

00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:45.920
it's roughly linear.

00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:48.390
So eventually, it does
start curving over.

00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:52.010
But maybe not as fast as
you would have thought.

00:40:56.500 --> 00:41:00.230
And at the very least, this
is a good [? no ?] model.

00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:03.134
And then, we can, of course,
complicate things later.

00:41:03.134 --> 00:41:05.050
But for now, we'll just
assume that you always

00:41:05.050 --> 00:41:06.925
sample from the same
probability distribution

00:41:06.925 --> 00:41:09.386
of beneficial mutations,
just for simplicity.

00:41:09.386 --> 00:41:13.170
The question is, how fast will
the fitness of the population

00:41:13.170 --> 00:41:15.835
increase with time?

00:41:15.835 --> 00:41:16.335
OK?

00:41:24.506 --> 00:41:26.005
Do you guys understand
the question?

00:41:30.190 --> 00:41:32.840
All right, let's start by
thinking about the regime where

00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:39.670
mu b N is much less than 1.

00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:47.860
So very low rates of mutation
relative to the population

00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:50.010
size.

00:41:50.010 --> 00:41:55.390
Now you might recall--
for clonal interference.

00:41:58.710 --> 00:42:02.400
So clonal interference
not relevant.

00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:05.280
What we found last
time was it required

00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:10.370
that the time that it
took for mutation to fix

00:42:10.370 --> 00:42:12.530
had to be much
less than the time

00:42:12.530 --> 00:42:16.570
between successive
establishments

00:42:16.570 --> 00:42:19.180
of these beneficial mutations.

00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:22.910
And this was 1 over s log N's.

00:42:31.890 --> 00:42:34.040
You should be able to
[? derive ?] both of these.

00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:39.255
This and that and this,
and the next step, as well.

00:42:51.264 --> 00:42:53.964
All right, so you can
ignore clonal interference

00:42:53.964 --> 00:42:54.630
if this is true.

00:42:57.430 --> 00:43:02.483
So let's say that we can
ignore clonal interference.

00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:10.660
So for small population
sizes or in the limit

00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:13.080
of low mutation rates.

00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:15.750
What we want to know is
the rate of evolution.

00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:17.585
How will it scale
with various things?

00:43:23.230 --> 00:43:25.340
I'll go ahead and
have us vote for-- OK.

00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:37.155
How does it scale with,
[? particular ?], both,

00:43:37.155 --> 00:43:39.970
the mutation rate and
the population size?

00:43:51.307 --> 00:43:52.390
It's proportional to what?

00:44:12.624 --> 00:44:14.040
Holding another
thing is constant.

00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:19.170
Holding, for example, the
distribution and n constant.

00:44:19.170 --> 00:44:19.670
OK?

00:44:26.144 --> 00:44:30.050
Do you understand the question?

00:44:30.050 --> 00:44:30.550
Yes.

00:44:30.550 --> 00:44:33.427
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:33.427 --> 00:44:34.010
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:44:34.010 --> 00:44:37.590
So this is just the rate
of beneficial mutations.

00:44:37.590 --> 00:44:39.132
And this is just
to the 0th power.

00:44:39.132 --> 00:44:40.090
i.e, it doesn't defend.

00:44:40.090 --> 00:44:42.280
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:44:42.280 --> 00:44:43.815
PROFESSOR: Linearly,
it's squared.

00:44:54.292 --> 00:44:55.776
All right, ready?

00:44:55.776 --> 00:44:56.742
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:59.574 --> 00:45:02.120
PROFESSOR: Yeah, assuming that
clonal interference is not

00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:04.150
relevant.

00:45:04.150 --> 00:45:06.130
So assuming, for a
small mutation rate,

00:45:06.130 --> 00:45:09.535
how does it scale
in mutation rate?

00:45:09.535 --> 00:45:12.260
OK, ready.

00:45:12.260 --> 00:45:14.790
Three, two, one.

00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:23.260
All right, so we got a
lot of B's, which is nice.

00:45:23.260 --> 00:45:27.440
So this is saying that, indeed,
if mutation rate is small,

00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:30.120
then there's going to be
some rate that mutations

00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:31.610
enter into the population.

00:45:31.610 --> 00:45:35.190
They may or may not survive
stochastic extinction.

00:45:35.190 --> 00:45:37.760
But if they do, and that
doesn't depend on mutation rate,

00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:40.720
then they can fix.

00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:42.560
And in this low
mutation rate regime,

00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:45.550
they don't compete
with each other.

00:45:45.550 --> 00:45:48.130
In which case, if you double
the rate of these things entered

00:45:48.130 --> 00:45:49.921
into the population,
you'll double the rate

00:45:49.921 --> 00:45:51.020
that they get established.

00:45:51.020 --> 00:45:53.920
And you'll double the rate that
these beneficial mutations will

00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:58.190
fix in the population
So you double the rate.

00:45:58.190 --> 00:46:00.080
OK?

00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:03.940
All right, now as
a function of n.

00:46:03.940 --> 00:46:11.906
Does it go as N
to the 0 or other?

00:46:11.906 --> 00:46:22.210
We got A, B, C, D. All right,
I'll give you 15 seconds

00:46:22.210 --> 00:46:23.689
to think about it.

00:46:41.950 --> 00:46:42.620
Ready?

00:46:42.620 --> 00:46:47.290
Three, two, one.

00:46:47.290 --> 00:46:50.920
OK, so now we're getting
more disagreement.

00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:51.790
All right.

00:46:51.790 --> 00:46:55.655
And I'd say,
largely, A's and B's.

00:46:55.655 --> 00:46:57.280
All right, there's
enough disagreement.

00:46:57.280 --> 00:47:00.290
Let's go ahead and
spend just 30 seconds.

00:47:00.290 --> 00:47:01.846
Turn to your neighbor.

00:47:01.846 --> 00:47:05.332
[SIDE CONVERSATIONS]

00:47:35.310 --> 00:47:36.499
Per individual, yeah.

00:47:36.499 --> 00:47:38.495
[SIDE CONVERSATIONS]

00:48:15.199 --> 00:48:16.740
All right, let's go
ahead and re-vote

00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:19.091
just so I can see where we are.

00:48:19.091 --> 00:48:20.590
How is it that the
rate of evolution

00:48:20.590 --> 00:48:22.540
in this regime, no
clonal interference,

00:48:22.540 --> 00:48:23.950
how is this going to
scale the population size?

00:48:23.950 --> 00:48:24.450
Ready?

00:48:24.450 --> 00:48:27.940
Three, two, one.

00:48:27.940 --> 00:48:28.440
OK

00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:30.530
So, I'd say that we have
not really convinced

00:48:30.530 --> 00:48:31.640
each other of anything.

00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:34.350
All right, so A's B's?

00:48:34.350 --> 00:48:39.225
Somebody explain the reasoning.

00:48:39.225 --> 00:48:39.724
Yeah.

00:48:39.724 --> 00:48:48.060
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
mutation rate [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:48.060 --> 00:48:50.140
larger the population,
the larger we're

00:48:50.140 --> 00:48:53.417
going to get
[INAUDIBLE] population.

00:48:53.417 --> 00:48:54.000
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:55.840
All right, so if you double
the size of the population,

00:48:55.840 --> 00:48:57.605
you'll double the rate
the new mutations enter

00:48:57.605 --> 00:48:58.438
into the population.

00:48:58.438 --> 00:49:00.260
AUDIENCE: And the
other important thing

00:49:00.260 --> 00:49:04.845
is that the fixation time
just goes, like, [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:04.845 --> 00:49:05.720
PROFESSOR: OK, right.

00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:07.760
So then there's the
fixation time business.

00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:09.980
So how is that relevant?

00:49:09.980 --> 00:49:16.015
Yeah, somebody that said A, what
was your partners reasoning?

00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:26.425
Or where you convinced
by this argument?

00:49:26.425 --> 00:49:28.900
Or confused.

00:49:28.900 --> 00:49:32.855
AUDIENCE: Well if it's
[INAUDIBLE], then the

00:49:32.855 --> 00:49:33.355
[INAUDIBLE].

00:49:35.807 --> 00:49:36.390
PROFESSOR: Ah.

00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:38.556
Right, so if it's a nearly
new [INAUDIBLE] mutation,

00:49:38.556 --> 00:49:42.075
then it's true that the
[INAUDIBLE] would be 1/N but--

00:49:42.075 --> 00:49:45.136
AUDIENCE: But if N is very
large then, sometimes,

00:49:45.136 --> 00:49:46.534
s will not [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:46.534 --> 00:49:48.280
PROFESSOR: OK, right.

00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:50.540
But now you're
invoking N being large,

00:49:50.540 --> 00:49:54.689
which I don't think we
necessarily want to do.

00:49:54.689 --> 00:49:56.980
I mean, I guess there are a
couple things to say there.

00:49:56.980 --> 00:50:00.800
One is that the mutations
that are really nearly neutral

00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:07.580
will not have a very significant
effect on the fitness.

00:50:07.580 --> 00:50:12.870
And within that
regime, I think, yeah,

00:50:12.870 --> 00:50:16.000
you'd have to check what
happens there, right?

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:21.980
But I think that, in most of
these cases, small population,

00:50:21.980 --> 00:50:24.830
we're often saying population
[? must be ?] 10 to the 4

00:50:24.830 --> 00:50:26.350
or so.

00:50:26.350 --> 00:50:28.560
In which case, the
nearly neutral mutations

00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:31.100
are not very relevant.

00:50:31.100 --> 00:50:31.900
Right?

00:50:31.900 --> 00:50:34.620
So indeed, over a broad range of
conditions, in this situation,

00:50:34.620 --> 00:50:41.610
it's going to scale as
N. So the rate, so far,

00:50:41.610 --> 00:50:47.730
it's going to equal to
there's a mu b times an N.

00:50:47.730 --> 00:50:52.780
And that's basically because
the rate the new mutations enter

00:50:52.780 --> 00:50:57.880
into the populations is mu
N. And the rate that they get

00:50:57.880 --> 00:50:59.500
established is just mu N's.

00:50:59.500 --> 00:51:03.420
This is, indeed, what this
calculation is telling us.

00:51:03.420 --> 00:51:08.010
Now the question is, how much
of a fitness gain will we get?

00:51:08.010 --> 00:51:11.696
How is it going to scale with
this probability distribution.

00:51:11.696 --> 00:51:13.570
So this probability
distribution will give us

00:51:13.570 --> 00:51:17.950
some function of s.

00:51:17.950 --> 00:51:19.910
So this distribution
has to be relevant.

00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:21.470
Do we agree?

00:51:21.470 --> 00:51:24.750
So we want to know in
what way is it relevant.

00:51:24.750 --> 00:51:35.440
Is it relevant via the
mean, via the mean squared,

00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:50.090
the mean cubed-- I don't know--
the mean squared, or other?

00:51:50.090 --> 00:51:51.460
This one is harder.

00:51:51.460 --> 00:51:54.130
So it's worth spending,
I'll give you,

00:51:54.130 --> 00:51:56.000
a full 30 seconds
to think about it.

00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:58.083
So the question is, how
is it that the probability

00:51:58.083 --> 00:52:00.320
distribution will enter
into the rate of evolution

00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:01.070
in this situation?

00:52:03.690 --> 00:52:04.190
OK?

00:52:04.190 --> 00:52:05.476
Question.

00:52:05.476 --> 00:52:06.462
No?

00:52:06.462 --> 00:52:07.941
AUDIENCE: Can [INAUDIBLE]?

00:52:14.350 --> 00:52:16.000
PROFESSOR: I'm
sorry, multiple what?

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:17.659
AUDIENCE: Is it
possible that it's

00:52:17.659 --> 00:52:19.320
entered in multiple situation?

00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:20.837
PROFESSOR: Oh, yeah.

00:52:20.837 --> 00:52:22.670
You know, this is why
I gave you flashcards.

00:52:22.670 --> 00:52:25.800
You can put up any
combination you want.

00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:30.560
Another 15 seconds.

00:52:30.560 --> 00:52:31.790
This one is trickier.

00:52:59.800 --> 00:53:02.100
Let's go ahead and vote.

00:53:02.100 --> 00:53:02.790
Ready?

00:53:02.790 --> 00:53:07.130
Three, two, one.

00:53:07.130 --> 00:53:11.140
All right, so we got
a lot of A's and B's.

00:53:11.140 --> 00:53:12.630
Some, maybe, C's and D's.

00:53:16.380 --> 00:53:17.400
All right, so yeah.

00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:19.300
We're pretty far.

00:53:19.300 --> 00:53:20.960
OK, we're all over the place.

00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:24.230
All right, so there's going
to be some distribution.

00:53:24.230 --> 00:53:31.220
There might be, for example,
probability distribution

00:53:31.220 --> 00:53:32.620
function of s, function of s.

00:53:32.620 --> 00:53:34.110
We want to know it's
going to something that's

00:53:34.110 --> 00:53:35.330
going to fall off in some way.

00:53:35.330 --> 00:53:36.080
Maybe exponential.

00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:38.330
Maybe something else.

00:53:38.330 --> 00:53:40.640
Now to keep track of
this, what we need to do

00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:48.900
is remember that the probability
of establishment goes as s.

00:53:48.900 --> 00:53:51.550
The probability
of establishment.

00:53:51.550 --> 00:53:53.667
And the [INAUDIBLE]
model is equal to s.

00:53:53.667 --> 00:53:55.000
In other models, it might be 2s.

00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:55.960
But it's around s.

00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:03.460
And then, the question
is, how much of a benefit

00:54:03.460 --> 00:54:05.410
will you get if
you do establish?

00:54:08.092 --> 00:54:09.670
All right.

00:54:09.670 --> 00:54:11.900
And that is, again,
going to go as--

00:54:11.900 --> 00:54:17.210
and whatever the delta fitness
is actually, again, equal

00:54:17.210 --> 00:54:21.540
to whatever acid is
that you sampled.

00:54:21.540 --> 00:54:27.980
And the given mutation that
appeared, you sample somewhere.

00:54:27.980 --> 00:54:33.390
It has to, both, survive and
well- if it survives, then

00:54:33.390 --> 00:54:35.452
it gives you an s.

00:54:35.452 --> 00:54:37.160
So what that means is
that, actually, you

00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:43.150
end up averaging s squared
of the distribution

00:54:43.150 --> 00:54:45.140
to determine the
rate of evolution.

00:54:49.810 --> 00:54:51.710
If it was just a
delta function at s,

00:54:51.710 --> 00:54:53.380
then it's just an s squared.

00:54:53.380 --> 00:54:55.831
So then you think, oh, it's
going to be mean of x squared.

00:54:55.831 --> 00:54:56.330
Right?

00:54:56.330 --> 00:54:57.880
But if it's a delta
function, then the mean

00:54:57.880 --> 00:55:00.171
of s squared and the mean s
squared are the same thing.

00:55:02.930 --> 00:55:05.020
But in this situation,
it's just useful to play

00:55:05.020 --> 00:55:06.395
with some different
distributions

00:55:06.395 --> 00:55:13.320
and see how it plays out.

00:55:13.320 --> 00:55:18.380
But in this case, it is,
indeed, mean s squared.

00:55:18.380 --> 00:55:25.210
So the rate of evolution in the
limit of no clonal interference

00:55:25.210 --> 00:55:27.691
is, actually, rather simple.

00:55:27.691 --> 00:55:29.830
It just goes as mu
N. But then, you

00:55:29.830 --> 00:55:31.230
have to take the
expectation of s

00:55:31.230 --> 00:55:33.480
squared of whatever
this distribution is

00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:35.739
of underlying mutations.

00:55:35.739 --> 00:55:36.239
OK?

00:55:41.241 --> 00:55:42.990
But of course, this
is going to break down

00:55:42.990 --> 00:55:46.740
at some point, as
everything does.

00:55:46.740 --> 00:55:49.559
And can somebody
remind us why it is

00:55:49.559 --> 00:55:50.808
that it's going to break down?

00:55:59.900 --> 00:56:01.450
Clonal interference.

00:56:01.450 --> 00:56:03.130
Perfect.

00:56:03.130 --> 00:56:06.330
And we know exactly where
clonal interference is going

00:56:06.330 --> 00:56:08.094
to start being relevant here.

00:56:08.094 --> 00:56:09.510
In particular,
what we can imagine

00:56:09.510 --> 00:56:11.135
drawing is something
that's [INAUDIBLE]

00:56:11.135 --> 00:56:15.640
the rate of evolution
as a function of N.

00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:21.120
So rate is a function
of N. And we might even

00:56:21.120 --> 00:56:23.170
want to plot in
a log, log scale.

00:56:26.190 --> 00:56:31.450
So we'll say the
log of the rate.

00:56:31.450 --> 00:56:33.490
The log of N.

00:56:33.490 --> 00:56:41.216
And at the beginning, what
do I draw here for small n?

00:56:45.980 --> 00:56:50.615
A line with slope 1.

00:56:50.615 --> 00:56:51.590
OK.

00:56:51.590 --> 00:56:53.700
If i had depended
on n squared, then

00:56:53.700 --> 00:56:57.000
what would I be drawing here?

00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:00.290
A line with slope 2.

00:57:00.290 --> 00:57:00.992
Yep.

00:57:00.992 --> 00:57:02.950
Don't mess that up because
it's really easy to.

00:57:02.950 --> 00:57:06.250
OK, so it's a line with slope 1.

00:57:06.250 --> 00:57:07.820
Right?

00:57:07.820 --> 00:57:10.454
So at the beginning, for
small population size,

00:57:10.454 --> 00:57:11.870
if you double the
population size,

00:57:11.870 --> 00:57:14.050
you should double the
rate of evolution.

00:57:14.050 --> 00:57:16.482
But this can't go on
forever, and it won't.

00:57:16.482 --> 00:57:18.065
So it's going to
curve over somewhere.

00:57:21.146 --> 00:57:22.014
all right.

00:57:22.014 --> 00:57:23.972
AUDIENCE: How can the
rate go down [INAUDIBLE]?

00:57:29.745 --> 00:57:32.245
PROFESSOR: the rate goes down
relative to what it would have

00:57:32.245 --> 00:57:34.280
if it had continued.

00:57:34.280 --> 00:57:36.077
And that's because
you're wasting

00:57:36.077 --> 00:57:37.160
some beneficial mutations.

00:57:37.160 --> 00:57:38.909
With clonal interference,
what's happening

00:57:38.909 --> 00:57:40.870
is that you have a
great mutation over here

00:57:40.870 --> 00:57:42.370
but also a great
mutation over here.

00:57:42.370 --> 00:57:44.850
And only one of those
great mutations can win.

00:57:44.850 --> 00:57:46.750
So with clonal
interference, you're,

00:57:46.750 --> 00:57:49.500
somehow, wasting some of
the beneficial mutations

00:57:49.500 --> 00:57:50.250
that you acquired.

00:57:54.026 --> 00:57:55.599
AUDIENCE: Even
though you're always

00:57:55.599 --> 00:57:57.432
taking the maximum
because what you're doing

00:57:57.432 --> 00:57:59.204
is you're [INAUDIBLE].

00:57:59.204 --> 00:58:00.870
PROFESSOR: Right
because the alternative

00:58:00.870 --> 00:58:04.030
would have been to take
the sum of them, which

00:58:04.030 --> 00:58:05.320
is what happens over here.

00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:07.520
If they're not competing,
then you got one.

00:58:07.520 --> 00:58:08.000
And you get the other.

00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:09.458
And you just get
higher and higher.

00:58:09.458 --> 00:58:12.820
With clonal interference,
you indeed take the maximum.

00:58:12.820 --> 00:58:14.130
But that's lower than sum.

00:58:16.782 --> 00:58:18.490
And that affect just
gets worse and worse

00:58:18.490 --> 00:58:21.140
as you get to larger
population sizes.

00:58:21.140 --> 00:58:26.410
So although it's
relatively simple

00:58:26.410 --> 00:58:28.210
to calculate the
rate of evolution

00:58:28.210 --> 00:58:29.857
in the limit of
small populations,

00:58:29.857 --> 00:58:32.190
the rate of evolution in the
case of clonal interference

00:58:32.190 --> 00:58:36.790
is, actually, a
very hard problem.

00:58:36.790 --> 00:58:42.650
Hard, well, experimentally,
theoretically, and in all ways.

00:58:42.650 --> 00:58:45.975
I just want to say a few things.

00:58:45.975 --> 00:58:48.350
There have been some really,
I think, interesting studies

00:58:48.350 --> 00:58:51.900
occurring over the last 10 years
trying to get at this regime.

00:58:51.900 --> 00:58:55.540
So the question is
how should it behave.

00:58:55.540 --> 00:59:07.640
And there's a paper by
Desai, Fisher, and Murray

00:59:07.640 --> 00:59:10.010
when they were all at Harvard.

00:59:10.010 --> 00:59:12.140
Since then, Daniel
Fisher, the [INAUDIBLE],

00:59:12.140 --> 00:59:14.010
has moved to Stanford.

00:59:14.010 --> 00:59:17.700
Desai went to Princeton but
then came back to Harvard.

00:59:17.700 --> 00:59:20.820
So he's now Harvard faculty.

00:59:20.820 --> 00:59:28.350
So this is current
biology in 2006, '07, '08.

00:59:28.350 --> 00:59:30.980
It's 2007.

00:59:30.980 --> 00:59:35.930
So they have, kind of,
a simplification of this

00:59:35.930 --> 00:59:37.870
where they asked
let's just assume

00:59:37.870 --> 00:59:39.750
that we don't have a
probability distribution

00:59:39.750 --> 00:59:41.970
of beneficial mutations.

00:59:41.970 --> 00:59:46.960
Instead, let's just assume
that there's some mutation rate

00:59:46.960 --> 00:59:50.690
to acquire beneficial
mutation that's exactly s.

00:59:50.690 --> 00:59:51.190
OK?

00:59:51.190 --> 00:59:53.398
So you say, all right, well
that sounds super simple.

00:59:53.398 --> 00:59:54.840
Of course, it's not true.

00:59:54.840 --> 00:59:57.300
But even that problem is hard.

00:59:57.300 --> 00:59:59.120
But what they can
do in this regime

00:59:59.120 --> 01:00:02.180
is that then it's nice because
everything's, kind of, discrete

01:00:02.180 --> 01:00:03.680
because then the
population is going

01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:10.480
to described by a
series of-- so this

01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:13.150
is abundance as a
function of the fitness.

01:00:13.150 --> 01:00:17.340
So this is, maybe, the bulk
minus fitness relative 0.

01:00:17.340 --> 01:00:23.030
Here, this is s, 2s, 3s, 4s, and
maybe there's a little bit here

01:00:23.030 --> 01:00:23.730
at 5s.

01:00:23.730 --> 01:00:25.909
OK?

01:00:25.909 --> 01:00:27.450
So what happens is
that there's going

01:00:27.450 --> 01:00:30.540
to be some equilibrium
distribution of this front

01:00:30.540 --> 01:00:33.660
or the nose of the population.

01:00:33.660 --> 01:00:35.920
And at some rate, these
guys get mutations

01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:38.812
where some individual, kind of,
comes like this because it gets

01:00:38.812 --> 01:00:40.020
a mutation that's beneficial.

01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:41.980
But that doesn't actually
affect the dynamics

01:00:41.980 --> 01:00:45.480
very much because all these
guys are growing exponentially.

01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:49.230
What's really relevant
are when individuals that

01:00:49.230 --> 01:00:51.870
have several or more of
these beneficial mutations

01:00:51.870 --> 01:00:56.650
than the rest of the population,
when these guys get a mutation

01:00:56.650 --> 01:00:58.610
that they can move forward.

01:00:58.610 --> 01:01:01.260
And it's this dynamic
that is, kind of,

01:01:01.260 --> 01:01:03.320
pulling the population here.

01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:07.270
So you can actually do analytic
calculations on this model

01:01:07.270 --> 01:01:09.895
that you would not be able to do
if you did a full distribution

01:01:09.895 --> 01:01:11.670
of mutations here.

01:01:11.670 --> 01:01:14.460
But it's actually still
complicated and hard.

01:01:14.460 --> 01:01:17.350
And I do not claim to have gone
through the full derivation

01:01:17.350 --> 01:01:20.500
because the full
thing is they get

01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:24.626
that the velocity in this
model approximately equal to.

01:01:24.626 --> 01:01:25.750
By then, it's an s squared.

01:01:47.630 --> 01:01:52.170
All right, so you might sneer
at this model and say, oh, well,

01:01:52.170 --> 01:01:54.790
you know, this is an
oversimplification,

01:01:54.790 --> 01:01:55.965
blah, blah, blah.

01:01:55.965 --> 01:01:57.180
But even this is hard.

01:01:57.180 --> 01:02:00.610
And you get a
complicated expression.

01:02:00.610 --> 01:02:02.419
And it's describing
something fundamental

01:02:02.419 --> 01:02:03.960
that's happening in
these populations

01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:05.330
with clonal interference.

01:02:05.330 --> 01:02:08.690
The important thing is that
you can-- more or less,

01:02:08.690 --> 01:02:11.774
this term is going to be the
dominant one in many cases,

01:02:11.774 --> 01:02:13.940
especially because we're
interested in the large end

01:02:13.940 --> 01:02:14.840
regime here.

01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:18.800
So what you see is that,
for large N in this model

01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:20.690
and they did experiments
in this paper that

01:02:20.690 --> 01:02:23.740
are consistent
with it, they find

01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:27.400
that the velocity-- the rate of
evolution-- this is the rate.

01:02:30.150 --> 01:02:33.740
You see her the s squared term
that we already talked about.

01:02:33.740 --> 01:02:34.844
Right?

01:02:34.844 --> 01:02:36.510
And there's no
probability distribution,

01:02:36.510 --> 01:02:37.920
so it's just an s squared.

01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:41.050
But what you see is that it ends
up going as log N for large N.

01:02:41.050 --> 01:02:43.400
So this is when there's a
lot of clonal interference.

01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:48.070
So maybe this thing
goes as log N.

01:02:48.070 --> 01:02:52.190
But I'd say, maybe, this is
not an open and shut case

01:02:52.190 --> 01:02:54.540
because real populations are
more complicated than this

01:02:54.540 --> 01:02:57.110
because it's not that every
mutation has magnitude s.

01:02:57.110 --> 01:03:00.110
But I think it's a
reasonable first order model.

01:03:00.110 --> 01:03:03.530
And I think this is a
nice set of calculations

01:03:03.530 --> 01:03:04.545
to make sense of things.

01:03:08.510 --> 01:03:12.700
Are there any questions
about that calculation

01:03:12.700 --> 01:03:15.490
or why this thing
curves off [INAUDIBLE]?

01:03:15.490 --> 01:03:16.407
Yes.

01:03:16.407 --> 01:03:18.275
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:03:18.275 --> 01:03:19.209
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:03:19.209 --> 01:03:22.478
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

01:03:22.478 --> 01:03:23.270
PROFESSOR: Sure.

01:03:23.270 --> 01:03:27.450
OK, so the question is why is
it that it's average s squared

01:03:27.450 --> 01:03:32.760
instead of average s squared?

01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:35.870
So what is it that's
useful to say?

01:03:35.870 --> 01:03:38.370
I'm trying to think of a
nice probability distribution

01:03:38.370 --> 01:03:42.730
where those things will
have very different--

01:03:47.310 --> 01:03:49.021
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

01:03:49.021 --> 01:03:50.520
PROFESSOR: For a
delta distribution,

01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:52.130
they're the same thing.

01:03:52.130 --> 01:03:57.650
So if we wanted to do an
intuitive explanation, maybe,

01:03:57.650 --> 01:04:00.870
[? probably ?]-- I'm
trying to think if we

01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:02.540
had two delta distributions.

01:04:02.540 --> 01:04:04.760
So the mean s would be here.

01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:05.260
Yeah, OK.

01:04:05.260 --> 01:04:09.170
So imagine that--
I know that this

01:04:09.170 --> 01:04:12.577
is not a real beneficial
mutation so maybe but OK.

01:04:12.577 --> 01:04:13.910
But it's something that's small.

01:04:13.910 --> 01:04:18.660
You know, negligently small
here and magnitude s over here.

01:04:18.660 --> 01:04:26.880
So the mean s is, indeed,
equal to this s 0 over 2.

01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:28.680
Right?

01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:35.735
Whereas, the mean of s squared
is, then, s squared 0 over 4.

01:04:38.507 --> 01:04:40.090
Are we looking at
something different?

01:04:40.090 --> 01:04:41.770
Oh, no.

01:04:41.770 --> 01:04:47.110
OK, I think I'm going to have
to come up with a better example

01:04:47.110 --> 01:04:47.610
to answer.

01:04:47.610 --> 01:04:50.540
So maybe after class we
can come up with one.

01:04:50.540 --> 01:04:52.499
I don't want to take
five minutes finding

01:04:52.499 --> 01:04:53.290
a good explanation.

01:04:53.290 --> 01:04:53.790
Yeah?

01:04:53.790 --> 01:04:54.772
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:01.140
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
so this is the rate

01:05:01.140 --> 01:05:05.700
of evolution in the regime
of large population size.

01:05:05.700 --> 01:05:06.520
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:08.150
PROFESSOR: And I
don't know how small

01:05:08.150 --> 01:05:11.360
you have to go before
[? funny ?] [INAUDIBLE].

01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:15.022
AUDIENCE: That's only for
the [? large ?] [INAUDIBLE].

01:05:15.022 --> 01:05:15.960
PROFESSOR: Yep.

01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:17.585
Yeah, and, of course,
you could imagine

01:05:17.585 --> 01:05:19.560
that taking various limits
is complicated here.

01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:23.890
But the important
thing is that the rate

01:05:23.890 --> 01:05:30.153
goes as log N for, in the
case, a clonal interference

01:05:30.153 --> 01:05:34.130
because that's the key thing
to remember, besides the fact

01:05:34.130 --> 01:05:37.540
that they actually had to
work to analyze this model.

01:05:44.785 --> 01:05:48.190
OK, so what I want to do is,
in the last 10, 15 minutes,

01:05:48.190 --> 01:05:50.640
to talk about this
[INAUDIBLE] paper

01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:54.620
because I think it's pretty.

01:05:54.620 --> 01:06:02.040
And I mean, it's
an elegant example

01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:05.340
of how, if you look at a
problem in a different way,

01:06:05.340 --> 01:06:09.390
then you can get, I think,
really interesting insights

01:06:09.390 --> 01:06:16.160
using a minimal amount
of, like, measurements.

01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:19.992
I mean, basically, how many
measurements are in this paper?

01:06:19.992 --> 01:06:20.824
AUDIENCE: 32.

01:06:20.824 --> 01:06:22.290
PROFESSOR: Basically, 32.

01:06:22.290 --> 01:06:24.960
Right?

01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:27.630
So what they are doing is
they're analyzing mutations

01:06:27.630 --> 01:06:29.620
in the enzyme beta
lactamase or the gene

01:06:29.620 --> 01:06:32.630
encoding beta lactamase,
which confers resistance

01:06:32.630 --> 01:06:36.051
to beta lactam drugs like,
in this case, cefataxime

01:06:36.051 --> 01:06:42.550
OK, so this guy gives
resistance to these beta lactam

01:06:42.550 --> 01:06:46.700
drugs that are like
ampicillin or penicillin.

01:06:46.700 --> 01:06:50.590
In this case, cefataxime.

01:06:50.590 --> 01:06:54.440
but not all of the versions
of this gene or the enzyme,

01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:59.250
actually, can break
down this new drug.

01:06:59.250 --> 01:07:03.180
So all 32 versions of the
enzyme that they study

01:07:03.180 --> 01:07:05.230
break down, for
example, ampicillin.

01:07:05.230 --> 01:07:10.110
But they had widely varying
levels of resistance or ability

01:07:10.110 --> 01:07:12.060
to break down this
drug, cefataxime.

01:07:15.966 --> 01:07:17.840
So they wanted to try
to understand something

01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:22.330
about what happens if you
start out with this base

01:07:22.330 --> 01:07:23.460
version of the enzyme.

01:07:23.460 --> 01:07:25.280
You know, if you
just look up what's

01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:28.850
the sequence for beta lactamase.

01:07:28.850 --> 01:07:30.340
What's going to be the sequence?

01:07:30.340 --> 01:07:33.220
And that we're going to call
the minus, minus, minus, minus,

01:07:33.220 --> 01:07:33.720
minus.

01:07:36.460 --> 01:07:39.660
And we might,
reasonably, want to know

01:07:39.660 --> 01:07:43.399
how does it get to the version
of the enzyme that has all five

01:07:43.399 --> 01:07:44.690
of these [? point ?] mutations?

01:07:48.190 --> 01:07:52.110
Does anybody remember what
those five mutations were?

01:07:52.110 --> 01:07:54.748
Like, what kind of
mutations are they?

01:07:54.748 --> 01:07:55.700
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:07:55.700 --> 01:07:58.170
PROFESSOR: They're all
[? point ?] mutations.

01:07:58.170 --> 01:08:01.380
And are they all protein
coding mutations?

01:08:01.380 --> 01:08:02.030
No.

01:08:02.030 --> 01:08:05.220
So actually, this
one here is actually

01:08:05.220 --> 01:08:07.880
a promoter mutation that
increases expression

01:08:07.880 --> 01:08:10.540
by a factor of two or three.

01:08:10.540 --> 01:08:12.420
Whereas, these things
here are indeed protein

01:08:12.420 --> 01:08:16.529
coding and change
the amino acid.

01:08:16.529 --> 01:08:17.736
Protein coding.

01:08:17.736 --> 01:08:20.050
The amino acids in the end.

01:08:20.050 --> 01:08:24.115
Well they each change one amino
acid in the resulting protein.

01:08:28.149 --> 01:08:31.670
So what Weinreich
in this paper was

01:08:31.670 --> 01:08:35.300
trying to understand is what
is the shape of these fitness

01:08:35.300 --> 01:08:36.120
landscapes?

01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:39.779
And what does that mean
about the course of evolution

01:08:39.779 --> 01:08:43.210
or the repeatability or
predictability of evolution?

01:08:45.982 --> 01:08:50.800
And I just want to stress
this is the Weinreich

01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:58.220
2006 because this version
of the gene/enzyme

01:08:58.220 --> 01:09:02.040
is, essentially, unable to
break down cefataxime at all.

01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:07.080
So E-coli that has
this version of enzyme,

01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:09.729
it's almost as if they don't
have any enzyme at all.

01:09:09.729 --> 01:09:11.439
Whereas, this
version of the enzyme

01:09:11.439 --> 01:09:16.174
is able to break down this drug,
cefataxime, at very high rates.

01:09:16.174 --> 01:09:17.715
And indeed, the way
that these things

01:09:17.715 --> 01:09:20.319
are quantified in this paper is
we have what's known as the MIC

01:09:20.319 --> 01:09:21.985
or the Minimum
Inhibitory Concentration.

01:09:26.580 --> 01:09:30.490
And basically, you
just ask-- oops,

01:09:30.490 --> 01:09:35.000
inhibitory
concentration-- what's

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:36.654
the minimum amount
of the antibiotic

01:09:36.654 --> 01:09:39.390
that you have to add
to prevent growth

01:09:39.390 --> 01:09:42.649
of the bacterial population
after 20 hours starting

01:09:42.649 --> 01:09:45.180
from some standard
cell density, OK?

01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:47.160
So it's a very easy
experiment to do

01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:52.290
because, 96 well [? plate ?],
you just have many wells.

01:09:52.290 --> 01:09:55.610
And you just go down a
concentration, maybe,

01:09:55.610 --> 01:09:59.220
by a factor of a
root 2 each time.

01:09:59.220 --> 01:10:01.580
So then, you go across 12 or 24.

01:10:01.580 --> 01:10:04.480
And you get over a broad range
of antibiotic concentrations.

01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:07.250
And what you should see
is that this is, maybe,

01:10:07.250 --> 01:10:08.850
dividing by route 2 each time.

01:10:08.850 --> 01:10:10.190
So you get growth here.

01:10:10.190 --> 01:10:11.620
You get growth here.

01:10:11.620 --> 01:10:14.270
Growth here but then no
growth, no growth, no growth.

01:10:14.270 --> 01:10:17.890
And the concentration and that
you added here is the MIC.

01:10:17.890 --> 01:10:19.510
What you'll see
is that, depending

01:10:19.510 --> 01:10:23.150
on the version of the enzyme
that the bacteria have,

01:10:23.150 --> 01:10:26.960
the growth will occur up to
different concentrations.

01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:29.215
AUDIENCE: Why would
you [INAUDIBLE]

01:10:29.215 --> 01:10:30.639
PROFESSOR: Why would you?

01:10:30.639 --> 01:10:31.180
Why is that--

01:10:31.180 --> 01:10:32.122
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:10:32.122 --> 01:10:33.580
PROFESSOR: Oh, I'm
just telling you

01:10:33.580 --> 01:10:35.780
what they actually did
experimentally in this paper.

01:10:35.780 --> 01:10:37.500
You could do a factor of 2.

01:10:37.500 --> 01:10:42.860
Or it's just a question how
fine of a resolution you want.

01:10:42.860 --> 01:10:46.170
How to do root 2?

01:10:46.170 --> 01:10:49.560
OK, so this is like a
mathematicians question,

01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:53.290
all right because your
point is going to be that--

01:10:53.290 --> 01:10:54.646
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] route 2.

01:10:54.646 --> 01:10:56.340
PROFESSOR: OK, so it's true.

01:10:56.340 --> 01:11:00.430
Root 2, it's an
irrational number.

01:11:00.430 --> 01:11:04.530
It's the first proof
in a analysis textbook.

01:11:04.530 --> 01:11:06.190
It doesn't matter, OK?

01:11:06.190 --> 01:11:09.920
Our error in pipe
heading is a percent,

01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:18.860
which means that if you
do 1.41, that's fine.

01:11:18.860 --> 01:11:20.280
Yes.

01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:23.320
So don't be paralyzed
by petting a root 2.

01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:24.820
OK?

01:11:24.820 --> 01:11:29.095
AUDIENCE: Is it always very
sharp, this changing in growth?

01:11:29.095 --> 01:11:31.250
PROFESSOR: You know,
biology and the word

01:11:31.250 --> 01:11:36.290
always should never be
used in the same sentence.

01:11:36.290 --> 01:11:38.820
I'd say that it's a
reasonable [? assay. ?]

01:11:38.820 --> 01:11:41.030
It's, typically, sharp.

01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:43.260
It happens, though, that
you get growth here.

01:11:43.260 --> 01:11:45.010
And then, you get
stressed out because you

01:11:45.010 --> 01:11:46.030
don't know what to do.

01:11:46.030 --> 01:11:50.050
I mean, the important thing
is that you do the experiment

01:11:50.050 --> 01:11:52.390
multiple times and you
have some reasonable rule

01:11:52.390 --> 01:11:54.270
for treating these things.

01:11:54.270 --> 01:11:56.320
Yeah, it can be more
complicated though.

01:12:00.924 --> 01:12:02.340
All right, what
we're going to use

01:12:02.340 --> 01:12:03.881
in the context of
this paper, though,

01:12:03.881 --> 01:12:06.650
is we're just going to
assume that this MIC is

01:12:06.650 --> 01:12:09.940
a measure for fitness.

01:12:09.940 --> 01:12:13.570
The mapping from MIC to fitness
is, actually, very nontrivial.

01:12:13.570 --> 01:12:16.130
Something my group has spent
a long time thinking about.

01:12:16.130 --> 01:12:20.090
But for the purpose of this
paper, just when you hear MIC,

01:12:20.090 --> 01:12:22.195
you can just say think
of it as fitness.

01:12:22.195 --> 01:12:26.130
OK, [? higher ?] MIC,
he assumes that it could

01:12:26.130 --> 01:12:27.520
be selected for by evolution.

01:12:30.860 --> 01:12:36.490
So there are, in principle, 2
to the five different states.

01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:43.560
Different versions of this gene.

01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:45.670
So what he did is he
constructed each 2 to the 5

01:12:45.670 --> 01:12:50.930
versions of the gene, put them
into the same strain of E-coli,

01:12:50.930 --> 01:12:55.041
and then measured the MIC
of each of those 32 strains.

01:12:55.041 --> 01:12:57.040
And that was all the
measurements in this paper,

01:12:57.040 --> 01:13:00.040
basically because
everything else is just

01:13:00.040 --> 01:13:02.950
analysis of that resulting
fitness landscape.

01:13:02.950 --> 01:13:05.940
But what's exciting
about this is just

01:13:05.940 --> 01:13:09.530
the ability to have an
experimental fitness

01:13:09.530 --> 01:13:12.720
landscape because we've
talked about fitness

01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:13.730
landscapes for years.

01:13:13.730 --> 01:13:16.710
But then, it tends to be
much more like what you saw

01:13:16.710 --> 01:13:19.237
in Martin Novak's book, right?

01:13:19.237 --> 01:13:21.320
That you can think about
these fitness landscapes.

01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:25.614
And you can do calculations
of what should happen on them.

01:13:25.614 --> 01:13:27.280
But this is a case
where we can actually

01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:29.280
just measure something akin
to a fitness landscape,

01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:30.700
and to try to say what it means.

01:13:30.700 --> 01:13:34.120
So you can ask questions about
how rugged is the landscape.

01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:37.240
How many different paths can
you take from this version

01:13:37.240 --> 01:13:40.490
to this version?

01:13:40.490 --> 01:13:44.910
So first of all, how many
peaks were in this landscape

01:13:44.910 --> 01:13:46.162
that he measured?

01:13:50.581 --> 01:13:51.563
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:13:51.563 --> 01:13:53.670
PROFESSOR: One peak.

01:13:53.670 --> 01:13:55.330
This is important.

01:13:55.330 --> 01:13:58.020
This was the one and only peak.

01:14:00.660 --> 01:14:03.210
And when you read this paper,
you come away thinking,

01:14:03.210 --> 01:14:05.690
oh yeah, this is a really
rugged landscape, right?

01:14:05.690 --> 01:14:08.480
Many of the paths were not
allowed by so-called Darwinian

01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:10.690
or selective evolution.

01:14:10.690 --> 01:14:14.030
But it's easy to forget that,
actually, it's not that.

01:14:14.030 --> 01:14:15.910
It's a moderately
rugged landscape

01:14:15.910 --> 01:14:19.690
because there was
still one peak.

01:14:19.690 --> 01:14:27.080
In particular, if you just
assume that the population

01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:29.860
starts at that minus,
minus, minus, state,

01:14:29.860 --> 01:14:32.170
starts travelling
uphill in fitness,

01:14:32.170 --> 01:14:35.190
gets a mutation and goes uphill,
is there any possibility for it

01:14:35.190 --> 01:14:37.670
to get trapped in a non-optimal?

01:14:37.670 --> 01:14:42.090
No because there
are no other peaks.

01:14:42.090 --> 01:14:43.740
So there's only one peak.

01:14:43.740 --> 01:14:46.050
That's the same thing
as saying that you

01:14:46.050 --> 01:14:48.240
can take any path you
like going uphill,

01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:50.580
and you will always get to
the same final location.

01:14:50.580 --> 01:14:54.940
You will never get
stuck anywhere.

01:14:54.940 --> 01:14:59.150
I mean, it does not
mean that you can take

01:14:59.150 --> 01:15:01.280
any old path that you want.

01:15:01.280 --> 01:15:03.410
Many of the paths may
be blocked in the sense

01:15:03.410 --> 01:15:06.250
that they may go
downhill and so forth.

01:15:06.250 --> 01:15:08.850
But at any location you're
at, there's always, at least,

01:15:08.850 --> 01:15:11.392
one path going up in
fitness, up in MIC.

01:15:11.392 --> 01:15:12.850
Doesn't matter
which path you take.

01:15:12.850 --> 01:15:15.980
You will always be able to get
to the peak of this landscape.

01:15:15.980 --> 01:15:17.450
OK?

01:15:17.450 --> 01:15:20.319
So it's not too rugged of
a landscape, in that sense.

01:15:20.319 --> 01:15:20.819
Yeah?

01:15:20.819 --> 01:15:23.652
AUDIENCE: Wasn't
it, [INAUDIBLE]?

01:15:23.652 --> 01:15:24.360
PROFESSOR: Right.

01:15:24.360 --> 01:15:26.710
So some paths are not
allowed in the sense

01:15:26.710 --> 01:15:30.957
that some paths decrease
fitness, locally.

01:15:30.957 --> 01:15:33.540
But what I'm saying is that you
can take a different path that

01:15:33.540 --> 01:15:34.331
goes up in fitness.

01:15:34.331 --> 01:15:37.922
And you'll still get
to the same peak.

01:15:37.922 --> 01:15:41.331
AUDIENCE: Right, but you
started in that [? wrong path ?]

01:15:41.331 --> 01:15:42.772
and you [INAUDIBLE].

01:15:42.772 --> 01:15:43.730
PROFESSOR: Well no, no.

01:15:43.730 --> 01:15:45.780
The thing is that you
can't take that path

01:15:45.780 --> 01:15:50.640
because that path goes down
in fitness is the claim.

01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:52.860
So the statement
from this paper is

01:15:52.860 --> 01:15:57.650
that, if we just assume
that the only mutations that

01:15:57.650 --> 01:15:59.980
can fix in a population
are mutations that increase

01:15:59.980 --> 01:16:02.845
fitness, than it
does not matter which

01:16:02.845 --> 01:16:04.220
of those beneficial
mutations you

01:16:04.220 --> 01:16:06.880
take because you will always
end up reaching the peak.

01:16:14.610 --> 01:16:16.987
So there are 120
possible trajectories.

01:16:16.987 --> 01:16:18.320
Can somebody say how we got 120?

01:16:25.952 --> 01:16:27.860
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:16:27.860 --> 01:16:29.000
PROFESSOR: Right.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:30.075
So this is 5 factorial.

01:16:34.210 --> 01:16:37.180
What he found by analyzing the
resulting fitness landscape

01:16:37.180 --> 01:16:40.070
is that 102 were
selectively inaccessible.

01:16:46.190 --> 01:16:50.790
Oh, I don't know how many--
is that the right way to spell

01:16:50.790 --> 01:16:52.048
that?

01:16:52.048 --> 01:16:53.750
Yeah.

01:16:53.750 --> 01:16:57.230
And what he's assuming is that
the only mutations that can fix

01:16:57.230 --> 01:17:00.360
are beneficial mutations.

01:17:00.360 --> 01:17:01.480
OK, right.

01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:03.310
In particular, if
you have two states,

01:17:03.310 --> 01:17:05.659
there's a mutation
that you could acquire.

01:17:05.659 --> 01:17:07.450
From here, let's say
you get this mutation,

01:17:07.450 --> 01:17:09.570
and that just leads
to the same MIC.

01:17:09.570 --> 01:17:13.054
He assumes that that
is inaccessible.

01:17:13.054 --> 01:17:14.032
All right?

01:17:14.032 --> 01:17:15.740
You know, and of
course, like all things,

01:17:15.740 --> 01:17:17.150
you can argue about it.

01:17:17.150 --> 01:17:19.300
What he's saying
is that it won't

01:17:19.300 --> 01:17:24.490
fix in reasonable times,
which is fair if it's really

01:17:24.490 --> 01:17:26.060
a neutral mutation.

01:17:26.060 --> 01:17:29.410
In particular, if you
have 10 to the 6 bacteria,

01:17:29.410 --> 01:17:32.670
and if the mutation rates
are the same everywhere

01:17:32.670 --> 01:17:36.280
and some mutations lead
to a significant increase

01:17:36.280 --> 01:17:38.430
in fitness, then
a neutral mutation

01:17:38.430 --> 01:17:41.150
would be unlikely to fix.

01:17:41.150 --> 01:17:43.500
So what he found is
that there were only,

01:17:43.500 --> 01:17:49.820
then, 18 of the 120 paths off
this fitness landscape that

01:17:49.820 --> 01:17:52.170
had monotonically
increasing fitness values.

01:17:55.150 --> 01:17:57.275
And indeed, if you analyze
those trajectories, what

01:17:57.275 --> 01:18:00.000
he found is that, actually,
18 [? isn't ?] maybe even

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.690
over [INAUDIBLE] because only
a few of those trajectories

01:18:02.690 --> 01:18:06.310
would likely occupy
majority of what

01:18:06.310 --> 01:18:09.730
you might call the actually
observed paths just because

01:18:09.730 --> 01:18:13.060
of the statistics of when those
paths branch and so forth.

01:18:13.060 --> 01:18:15.120
So the argument from
this paper is that we

01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:16.915
can measure fitness landscapes.

01:18:16.915 --> 01:18:18.290
And from it, we
can say something

01:18:18.290 --> 01:18:20.580
about the path of
evolution, perhaps.

01:18:20.580 --> 01:18:22.580
Other people have since
gone and done, actually,

01:18:22.580 --> 01:18:24.355
laboratory evolution on a
different antibiotic resistance

01:18:24.355 --> 01:18:25.970
gene-- again, Roy
[? Kashoney ?],

01:18:25.970 --> 01:18:28.500
actually-- to confirm
that these landscapes,

01:18:28.500 --> 01:18:32.580
at least in some cases, can
inform laboratory evolution.

01:18:32.580 --> 01:18:35.670
So there is a sense that maybe
evolution is more predictable

01:18:35.670 --> 01:18:37.800
than you would have thought.

01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:38.640
We're out of time.

01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:41.290
But if you have any questions,
please, go ahead and come on up

01:18:41.290 --> 01:18:43.190
and ask them.

01:18:43.190 --> 01:18:43.790
All right?

01:18:43.790 --> 01:18:45.340
Thanks.
