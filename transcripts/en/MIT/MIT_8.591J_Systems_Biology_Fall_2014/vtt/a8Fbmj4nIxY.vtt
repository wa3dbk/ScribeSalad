00:00:20.152 --> 00:00:22.360
PROFESSOR: All right, so
today what we're going to do

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.170
is we're just start with
a short review problem

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.070
on rugged landscapes,
just so that you

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:28.770
get some sense of
the kind of thing

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.330
that I would expect you to be
able to do a week from today.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.680
And then we'll get into the
core topic of the class, which

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.150
is evolutionary game theory.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.180
And we'll discuss
why it is that you

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.519
don't need to invoke any
notion of rationality, which

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:45.560
is kind of the traditional
thing we do when we're

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.685
talking about game theory
applied to human decision

00:00:47.685 --> 00:00:48.820
making.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.806
Then we'll try to
understand this difference

00:00:50.806 --> 00:00:53.180
to know what a Nash equilibrium
is in the context of game

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.120
theory versus an
evolutionary stable strategy

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.924
in this context.

00:00:57.924 --> 00:01:00.340
And we'll say something about
the evolution of cooperation

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.260
and experiments that one can
do with microbial populations

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.010
in the laboratory.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.045
Are there any questions
before I get started?

00:01:19.312 --> 00:01:25.330
All right, so just on this
question of evolutionary paths,

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.780
on Tuesday we discussed
the Weinreich paper

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.510
where he talked about
sort of different models

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.350
that you might use to try to
make estimates of the path

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.480
that evolution might take
on that fitness landscape

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.930
that he measured.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.560
So he measured this MIC,
the minimum inhibitory

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.097
concentration, on all 2 to
the 5 or 32 different states,

00:01:45.097 --> 00:01:47.305
and then tried to say
something about the probability

00:01:47.305 --> 00:01:49.370
that different
paths will be taken.

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.870
So I just want to
explore this question

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.162
about paths in a
simpler landscape, where

00:01:55.162 --> 00:01:57.620
by construction here, I'm to
going to give you some fitness

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.130
values just so that we
can be clear about why

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.194
it is that there might
be different paths,

00:02:02.194 --> 00:02:03.610
or what determines
the probability

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.146
that different paths are taken.

00:02:05.146 --> 00:02:06.770
So what we want to
do is assume that we

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:12.445
are in a population that is
experiencing this Moran process

00:02:12.445 --> 00:02:18.660
or Moran model, constant
population size N equal to,

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.780
in this case, we'll say 1,000.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.740
And let's say that the mutation
rate is 10 to the minus 6.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.204
So each time that an
individual divides, it has a 1

00:02:30.204 --> 00:02:32.610
in a million
probability of mutating.

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.785
And that's a per base
pair mutation rate.

00:02:36.785 --> 00:02:39.494
And I'll show you
what I mean by that.

00:02:39.494 --> 00:02:41.535
And in particular, we're
going to have genotypes.

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.360
Originally when
we discussed this,

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.845
we were talking about just
mutations, maybe A's and B's.

00:02:48.845 --> 00:02:50.220
But now, what
we're going to have

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.920
is just a short genome
that's string length 2.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:02.890
So we might have 0, 0, which
has relative fitness 1, 0, 1.

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.810
So we're assuming that
this is relative fitness

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.380
as compared to the 0, 0 state.

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:25.350
We're going to start in
the 0, 0 state with 1,000

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.390
isogenic individuals, all 0, 0.

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.020
And the question is, what's
going to happen eventually?

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:55.980
And in particular, what path
will be taken on this landscape

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:56.480
here?

00:04:03.372 --> 00:04:04.830
In particular, what
we want to know

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.000
is the probability
of taking this path.

00:04:33.989 --> 00:04:36.030
You can start thinking
about it while I write out

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.630
some possibilities
that we can vote for,

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:40.626
and I'll give you a
minute to think about it.

00:04:40.626 --> 00:04:45.090
So don't--

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:22.644
Are there any questions about
what I'm trying to ask here?

00:05:22.644 --> 00:05:28.299
AUDIENCE: So this
is the long time?

00:05:28.299 --> 00:05:30.480
So we assume that
in the long time,

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.880
it will go from 0, 0 to 1, 1?

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.400
PROFESSOR: That's right, yes,
so if we wait long enough,

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.900
the population will get
there, and the 1, 1 genotype

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.210
will fix in the population.

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:44.490
We can talk a bit later
about how long it's

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:46.432
going to take to get
there, and so forth.

00:05:46.432 --> 00:05:48.892
AUDIENCE: And we're
assuming that from 0, 1,

00:05:48.892 --> 00:05:52.342
it can't go back to 0, 0?

00:05:52.342 --> 00:05:53.050
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:57.080
Yeah, so we'll
discuss the situations

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.480
when we have to
worry about that,

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.010
and when we don't, and so forth.

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:02.320
But for now, if
you'd like, we can

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:05.400
say that this is even just mu
sub b, the beneficial mutation

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.200
rate per base pair, assuming
that the 0's can only

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.770
turn into 1s.

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:13.130
Then after we think
about this, we

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:17.029
could figure out if
that's important,

00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:18.570
or when it's important,
and so forth.

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:23.880
Yes.

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:24.796
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:31.540
PROFESSOR: No.

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:34.720
All right, so we're starting
with all 1,000 individuals

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.770
being in the 0, 0
state, because now we're

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:38.187
allowing some mutation rate.

00:06:38.187 --> 00:06:39.141
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:45.579 --> 00:06:47.120
PROFESSOR: And you
also have to think

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:51.370
about this first mutation--
will it fix or not?

00:06:55.128 --> 00:06:59.000
AUDIENCE: But it's not
[INAUDIBLE] first mutation,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.904
the mutation of one
element of that population

00:07:01.904 --> 00:07:06.141
will go to 0, 1 [INAUDIBLE]?

00:07:06.141 --> 00:07:08.390
PROFESSOR: I'm not sure if
I understand your question.

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:11.785
AUDIENCE: So if we start out
with all 0, 0, and then one

00:07:11.785 --> 00:07:12.755
mutation [INAUDIBLE]?

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:19.545
And if that mutation--
are we assuming

00:07:19.545 --> 00:07:22.470
that that mutation is 0, 1 and
then figuring out [INAUDIBLE]?

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:24.740
PROFESSOR: Well, OK,
you're asking kind

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:26.902
of what I mean by path here.

00:07:26.902 --> 00:07:28.230
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I guess.

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:31.180
PROFESSOR: Yeah, all
right, so I'll say path

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:37.130
means that that this was
the dominant probability

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:40.180
trajectory of the
population through there.

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:43.140
We'll also discuss
whether it somehow

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:46.690
is very likely is going to
kind of have to go through one

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:48.930
or the other of them.

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:52.450
The probability of getting both
mutations in one generation

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:55.230
is going to be 10
to the minus 12.

00:07:55.230 --> 00:08:00.040
So that's going to be a very
rare thing, at least given

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:02.157
these parameters, and so forth.

00:08:02.157 --> 00:08:03.990
And then there's another
question, which is,

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:07.780
will 0, 1 actually
fix in the population

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:12.247
before you later
fix this population?

00:08:12.247 --> 00:08:14.580
And actually, I think the
answers to all these questions

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:16.163
are in principal
already on the board.

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:22.404
Because there's a
question of do we

00:08:22.404 --> 00:08:24.070
have to worry about
clonal interference?

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:27.060
Are these things neutral or not?

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:30.500
And really, this is in some
ways a very simple problem.

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:32.010
But in another way,
you have to keep

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:34.110
track of lots of
different things,

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:37.080
and which regime
we're in and so forth.

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:40.820
So that's what makes it such
a wonderful exam problem.

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:44.780
If you understand
what's going on,

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:46.477
you can answer it in a minute.

00:08:46.477 --> 00:08:48.310
But if you don't
understand what's going on,

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:49.590
it'll take you an hour.

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:52.510
Yes?

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:53.010
No?

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:53.610
Maybe?

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:57.269
Well, I'll give you
another 20 seconds.

00:08:57.269 --> 00:08:58.935
Hopefully, you've
been thinking about it

00:08:58.935 --> 00:08:59.976
while we've been talking.

00:09:19.305 --> 00:09:20.680
All right, do you
need more time?

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.470
Why don't we go ahead and vote?

00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:13.820
I think it's very
likely that we will not

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:15.889
be at the kind of 100%
mark, in which case

00:10:15.889 --> 00:10:18.222
you'll have a chance to talk
about it and think about it

00:10:18.222 --> 00:10:18.722
some more.

00:10:18.722 --> 00:10:19.370
Ready?

00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:21.460
Three, two, one.

00:10:25.476 --> 00:10:29.710
OK, all right, so we do have
a fair range of answers.

00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:32.050
I'd say it might be kind
of something like 50-50.

00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:33.090
And that's great.

00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:35.880
It means that there should
be something to talk about.

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:37.072
So turn to a neighbor.

00:10:37.072 --> 00:10:38.530
You should be able
to find somebody

00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:40.180
that disagrees with you.

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:44.080
And if everyone around you
agrees, you can maybe--

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:46.690
all right, so there's a group
of D's and a group of B's here,

00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:48.064
which means that everybody--

00:10:48.064 --> 00:10:48.980
AUDIENCE: Let's fight.

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:49.680
PROFESSOR: All
right, so everybody

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:50.950
thinks that everybody
agrees with them,

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:53.366
but you just need to look a
little bit more long distance.

00:10:53.366 --> 00:10:55.270
So turn to a pseudo-neighbor.

00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:58.910
You should be able to
find somebody there.

00:10:58.910 --> 00:11:02.695
It's roughly even here, so you
should be able to find someone.

00:11:02.695 --> 00:11:06.118
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:11:46.329 --> 00:11:48.495
So I don't see much in the
way of vibrant discussion

00:11:48.495 --> 00:11:49.280
and argument.

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:52.882
You guys should be passionately
defending your choice here.

00:11:52.882 --> 00:11:56.354
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:12:41.264 --> 00:12:42.680
Yeah, that's a
higher order point.

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:43.846
I wouldn't worry about that.

00:12:46.089 --> 00:12:46.922
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:12:59.350 --> 00:13:02.050
All right, it looks like people
are having a nice discussion.

00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:04.350
But I might still go
ahead and cut it short,

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:07.842
just so that we can get on
to evolutionary game theory.

00:13:07.842 --> 00:13:09.550
But I would like to
see where people are.

00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:11.730
And we'll discuss it
as a group, so don't

00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:14.960
be too disappointed if you
don't get finished there.

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:17.140
But I do want to see
kind of where we are.

00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:18.150
Ready?

00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:19.970
Three, two, one.

00:13:23.748 --> 00:13:30.090
OK, so it still is, maybe,
split roughly equally between D

00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:35.200
and maybe a B-ish and some C's.

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:38.840
All right, does somebody want
to volunteer their explanation?

00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:45.468
Yes.

00:13:45.468 --> 00:13:47.963
AUDIENCE: I'm not
sure how good it is,

00:13:47.963 --> 00:13:51.955
but I was thinking about
what's the probability of going

00:13:51.955 --> 00:13:55.448
to 0, 1 instead of 1, 0.

00:13:55.448 --> 00:14:04.929
And I just took it as the ratio
of the extra benefit of 0, 1

00:14:04.929 --> 00:14:07.460
over the benefit of 1, 0.

00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:09.910
PROFESSOR: Sure, OK,
and just to start out,

00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:11.510
which answer are
you arguing for?

00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:12.100
AUDIENCE: D.

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:13.130
PROFESSOR: D, OK, all right.

00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:15.180
So you're saying D. And
you're saying, all right,

00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:18.500
maybe because of the
extra, that 1, 0 is somehow

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:20.520
more fit than 0, 1.

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:24.290
And you've taken some
relative rates or ratios

00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:27.218
for which reason?

00:14:27.218 --> 00:14:31.130
AUDIENCE: Well, I took 0.02
and then 0.1, which is 1/5.

00:14:31.130 --> 00:14:34.176
And then I decided
that that should

00:14:34.176 --> 00:14:36.509
be around what it is, but
slightly less, because there's

00:14:36.509 --> 00:14:40.010
also a chance that [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:40.810
PROFESSOR: OK, yes.

00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:43.320
I think the arguments
there-- there's

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:46.730
a lot of truth to the
arguments that you're saying.

00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:50.580
Yeah, it's a little--
right and another question

00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:55.080
is exactly why might it
be 1/6 instead of 1/5 is,

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:58.630
I think, a little bit
hazy in this here.

00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:00.309
It's OK, but it's close.

00:15:00.309 --> 00:15:02.100
Does somebody want to
offer an explanation?

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:05.580
So here, that was an argument
of roughly maybe why it's D-ish.

00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:07.720
Because D is very
different from B--

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:09.930
order of magnitude different.

00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:13.460
So can somebody offer why their
neighbor thought it was B?

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:14.460
Yeah.

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:18.039
AUDIENCE: So I knew that it was
B, because I considered the two

00:15:18.039 --> 00:15:20.631
paths, both from 0, 0 to 0, 1.

00:15:20.631 --> 00:15:23.310
I first checked S, N
and it's non-neutral.

00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:27.766
So probably [INAUDIBLE]
S. So the probability

00:15:27.766 --> 00:15:31.378
for that first path
would be the S for 0, 1,

00:15:31.378 --> 00:15:34.820
so it's 0.02, which is 1/50,
multiplied by the probability

00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:38.800
that the other [INAUDIBLE] 1,
0 would die out [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:41.360
PROFESSOR: Right, so there
are two related questions.

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:43.150
And I think that
this explanation here

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:45.780
is answering a slightly
different question.

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:47.350
OK, so let me try
to explain what

00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:50.050
the two questions are here.

00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:51.830
So the question that
you're answering

00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:58.410
is, if you have kind
of 998 individuals that

00:15:58.410 --> 00:16:01.860
are 0, 0 individuals, and
you have one that's 0, 1,

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:05.200
and you have one
individual that is 1, 0.

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:08.660
So this is like these problems
that we did a couple weeks ago,

00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:11.324
where we said, you imagine
in the population you have

00:16:11.324 --> 00:16:13.740
a couple different kinds of
mutants that are present maybe

00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:15.599
in one copy.

00:16:15.599 --> 00:16:17.140
And then we were
asking, well, what's

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:19.930
the probability that this
individual is going to fix?

00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:21.440
And what's the probability this
individual is going to fix?

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:23.380
And what's the probability
that these guys are

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:26.580
going to go extinct, and
this one will therefore fix?

00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:30.270
And I think that's the
calculation that you're

00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:32.440
describing, where
you say, OK, well,

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:35.710
in order for this
individual to fix,

00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:40.840
he has to survive stochastic
extinction, which happens

00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:43.820
with the probability of 2%.

00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:49.190
And the 1, 0 individual
has to go extinct,

00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:53.220
which happens 90% of the time.

00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:57.340
And so this is, indeed,
answering the question

00:16:57.340 --> 00:17:02.300
that if you had one copy of each
of these two mutant individuals

00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:06.910
in the population,
that's the answer to what

00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:10.460
is the probability
that this 0, 1 mutant

00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:11.880
would fix in the population.

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:13.300
Right?

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:16.290
But that's a slightly different
question than if we ask,

00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:19.236
we're going to start with an
entire population at 0, 0,

00:17:19.236 --> 00:17:21.319
and now these mutations
will be occurring randomly

00:17:21.319 --> 00:17:22.200
at some rate.

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:23.970
And then something's
going to happen.

00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:25.250
Somehow the population
is going to climb up

00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:26.349
this fitness landscape.

00:17:26.349 --> 00:17:29.230
And we're trying to figure
out the relative probability

00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:32.010
that it's going to take
kind of one path or another.

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:37.090
Do you see the difference
between these two questions?

00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:44.550
So indeed, this is the correct
answer to a different question.

00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:47.260
And so it's going
to end up being D.

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:50.990
And now we want to try to
figure out how to get there.

00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:54.310
Because I think it
is a bit tricky.

00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:56.580
And in order in order to
figure out to get there,

00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:59.860
we have to make sure
we keep track of which

00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:01.210
parameter regime we're in.

00:18:01.210 --> 00:18:03.390
So there are a couple of
questions we have to ask.

00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:05.590
First of all, we
have to remember

00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:07.940
that we start out with
everybody, all 1,000

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:09.190
individuals in the 0, 0 state.

00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:12.210
So there are initially no
mutants in the population.

00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:14.240
But they're just
replicating at some rate.

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:16.910
And every now and then,
mutation's going to occur.

00:18:16.910 --> 00:18:20.480
Now one thing we have to
answer, we have to think about,

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:22.550
is whether these are
nearly neutral mutations.

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:29.350
Verbally yes or no?

00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:29.850
Ready?

00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:31.610
Three, two, one.

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:32.180
AUDIENCE: No.

00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:33.570
PROFESSOR: No, right.

00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:35.017
And that's because
we want to ask

00:18:35.017 --> 00:18:36.850
for, if it's nearly
neutral, we want to ask,

00:18:36.850 --> 00:18:40.510
is the magnitude of S times
N much greater or much less

00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:42.040
than 1?

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:44.450
In particular, if they're
much greater than 1,

00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:49.559
as is the case here, then
we're in a nice, simple regime.

00:18:49.559 --> 00:18:51.600
And it's easy to get
paralyzed in this situation,

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:56.920
because there's more than
one S. But in both cases,

00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:58.260
S times N is much larger than 1.

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:01.580
We can take the smaller
S, which is 2 over 100,

00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:03.540
and S times N is 20, right?

00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:10.680
So S for the 0, 1
state times N is 20,

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:14.080
which is much greater than 1.

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:15.710
What this tells us
is that if we do

00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:19.340
get this mutant appearing
in the population,

00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:23.810
then he or she will have a
probability S of surviving

00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:24.810
stochastic extinction.

00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:34.470
So probability of surviving
stochastic extinction

00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:38.220
if the individual
appears is equal to S 0,

00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:42.450
1, which is equal to 2%.

00:19:42.450 --> 00:19:57.500
Whereas for the 1, 0 state,
that's going to be 0.1.

00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:00.660
Now, this is assuming
that the mutation appears

00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:03.350
in the population, that's the
probability it will survive

00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:05.300
stochastic extinction.

00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:08.730
Now, just as a reminder,
surviving stochastic extinction

00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:12.540
roughly corresponds to this
becoming an established idea.

00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:14.600
And becoming established
was what again?

00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:22.952
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:22.952 --> 00:20:23.910
PROFESSOR: What's that?

00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:26.090
AUDIENCE: S1 is [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:27.440
PROFESSOR: It's when S1--

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:28.380
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:29.630
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's right.

00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:32.860
All right, so established--
when we say established,

00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:37.960
what we mean is that
this corresponds

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:42.280
to saying that this probability
that we talked about

00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:47.050
before this X sub i is
approximately equal to 1.

00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:49.050
So this question is, how
many individuals do you

00:20:49.050 --> 00:20:51.910
have to get to in the
population before you're

00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:54.030
very likely to fix?

00:20:54.030 --> 00:21:00.130
And what we found is that that
number established went as 1

00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:02.570
over the selection coefficient.

00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:06.264
So in this case, you would
need to have 50 individuals

00:21:06.264 --> 00:21:08.430
before you were kind of
more likely to fix than not.

00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:10.013
So if you want to
be much more likely,

00:21:10.013 --> 00:21:13.420
you might need twice that or so.

00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:16.242
Do you guys remember that?

00:21:16.242 --> 00:21:18.450
This is not important for
this question, necessarily,

00:21:18.450 --> 00:21:22.284
but it might be important
at a later date.

00:21:22.284 --> 00:21:24.260
AUDIENCE: And so for
nearly neutral mutations,

00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:25.989
the whole point is
that the number needed

00:21:25.989 --> 00:21:29.200
to become established is
equal to the population.

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:32.430
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so everything
kind of works, right?

00:21:35.910 --> 00:21:37.710
OK, so the way that we
can think about this

00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:41.020
is, now we have this
population, 1,000 individuals.

00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:43.590
They're dividing at some rate.

00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:45.060
Mutations are going to appear.

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:51.270
Now we know if they did appear,
the probability they would fix.

00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:53.785
This is assuming there's no
clonal interference, right?

00:22:05.375 --> 00:22:07.000
Because if there's
clonal interference,

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.450
then surviving
stochastic extinction

00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:11.572
is not the same thing as fixing.

00:22:11.572 --> 00:22:13.155
If they both appear
in the population,

00:22:13.155 --> 00:22:15.780
and they both survive
stochastic extinction,

00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:19.440
then this mutant
loses to this mutant.

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:21.570
That's the clonal interference.

00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:24.236
Do we have to worry about clonal
interference in this situation?

00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:54.340
So remember, this was
comparing the two time scales.

00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:57.400
This was comparing
the time between

00:22:57.400 --> 00:23:06.998
successive establishment events,
which went as 1 over mu N S.

00:23:06.998 --> 00:23:11.200
And the other one is the
time between the time to fix,

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:16.130
which went as 1 over
S log of NS, right?

00:23:16.130 --> 00:23:17.710
So we can ignore
clonal interference

00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:19.180
if this is much
larger than that.

00:23:22.730 --> 00:23:24.820
So no clonal
interference corresponds

00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:32.960
to mu N log NS much less than 1.

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:35.860
No clonal interference,
same as this statement.

00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:36.480
Is that right?

00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:41.386
Did I do it right?

00:23:41.386 --> 00:23:43.920
OK.

00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:47.650
So and once again, there
are multiple S's, and it's

00:23:47.650 --> 00:23:50.220
easy to get kind of
upset about this.

00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:53.096
But you can just use
whichever S would be--

00:23:53.096 --> 00:23:54.970
which S would you want
to use to be kind of--

00:23:57.221 --> 00:23:58.762
AUDIENCE: Small or
large [INAUDIBLE]?

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:04.550
PROFESSOR: To be on the
safe or conservative side,

00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:06.760
we want to take this to
be as big as possible.

00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:11.120
So we take S actually
as big as we can, right?

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:12.250
It's in the log.

00:24:12.250 --> 00:24:13.720
So details, right?

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:20.900
But we can see we have 10
to the minus 6, 10 to the 3,

00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:28.430
and then this is the
log of maybe 100, which

00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:32.012
is, like, 4 or 5.

00:24:32.012 --> 00:24:32.970
Is it closer to 4 or 5?

00:24:32.970 --> 00:24:35.480
I don't know, but
it doesn't matter.

00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:36.680
We'll say 5.

00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:38.070
This is indeed much less than 1.

00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:45.010
So indeed, we
don't have to worry

00:24:45.010 --> 00:24:46.680
about clonal interference.

00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:49.240
This is a wonderful
simplification.

00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:52.440
What it's saying is that
the population is dividing.

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:55.760
Every now and then, a mutation
occurs in the population.

00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:58.290
It could be either
the 0, 1 or the 1, 0.

00:24:58.290 --> 00:25:01.000
But in either case, the
fate of that mutation

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.039
is resolved before the
next mutation occurs.

00:25:04.039 --> 00:25:05.580
So you don't need
to worry about them

00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:06.900
competing in the population.

00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:10.440
Instead, just at some constant
rate they're appearing.

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:13.290
And given that they appear,
there's some probability

00:25:13.290 --> 00:25:14.610
that they're going to fix.

00:25:14.610 --> 00:25:17.420
So that leads to effective
rates going to each of those two

00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:20.690
steps-- going to 0, 1 or 1, 0.

00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:24.570
And in particular, this is like
a chemical reaction, where we

00:25:24.570 --> 00:25:29.110
have some chemical state here.

00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:30.540
We have two rates.

00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:35.760
There's the k going to 0,
1, the k going to 1, 0.

00:25:39.410 --> 00:25:41.899
And what we know is we know
the ratio of those rates.

00:25:41.899 --> 00:25:43.440
And that's everything
we need to know

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:45.481
to calculate the relative
probabilities of taking

00:25:45.481 --> 00:25:50.810
those states, because the
probability of going through

00:25:50.810 --> 00:25:53.960
to 0, 1-- we want to go
that direction-- 0, 1, this

00:25:53.960 --> 00:26:02.330
is going to be given by k 0, 1
divided by k 0, 1 plus k 1, 0.

00:26:02.330 --> 00:26:05.810
So this is how we get
1/6 instead of 1/5.

00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:10.950
Because this thing
is 1/5 of that.

00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:12.870
So it's like 1, and then 1, 5.

00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:24.270
So this is actually, in
principle, not quite answering

00:26:24.270 --> 00:26:26.320
the question that I
asked, because this

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:30.250
is talking about the relative
probability of the first state,

00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:32.120
the first mutant to fix.

00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:35.780
In principle, it is possible
that from there, there's

00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:37.040
some rate of coming back.

00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:40.214
Or they might not necessarily
move forward on up that hill.

00:26:40.214 --> 00:26:42.130
Do you guys understand
what I'm talking about?

00:26:42.130 --> 00:26:43.588
Because it goes
from here to there.

00:26:43.588 --> 00:26:47.520
Because we really want to
know about this next step,

00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:49.290
going to the 1, 1 state.

00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:57.760
But in this case do we have to
worry about going backwards?

00:26:57.760 --> 00:26:58.320
No.

00:26:58.320 --> 00:26:58.990
And why not?

00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:03.720
It's very unlikely.

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:05.502
And in particular,
you could think now

00:27:05.502 --> 00:27:07.710
that you're here you can
talk about the rate of going

00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:11.310
to the 1, 1 state as compared
to the rate of going to 0, 1.

00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:17.080
And those are going to be
exponentially different.

00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:19.950
Because just as this was
a non-neutral beneficial

00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:21.820
mutation, that means
that going from 0,

00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:24.260
1 back is going to be a
non-neutral deleterious

00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:25.685
mutation.

00:27:25.685 --> 00:27:28.310
So the probability of fixing it
in the back direction is not 0,

00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:29.726
but it's exponentially
suppressed.

00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:38.890
I think it's very
important to understand

00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:41.290
all the different pieces
of this kind of puzzle,

00:27:41.290 --> 00:27:44.070
because it incorporates many
different ideas that we've

00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:46.665
talked about over
the last few weeks.

00:27:46.665 --> 00:27:50.480
If there are questions,
please ask now.

00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:51.277
Yes.

00:27:51.277 --> 00:27:52.818
AUDIENCE: What about
the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:27:58.285 --> 00:28:09.219
[INAUDIBLE] 0, 0
to 1, 0 to 1, 1?

00:28:09.219 --> 00:28:13.195
Then it seems like the benefit
of 1, 0 versus [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:19.300
PROFESSOR: All right, so
you're wondering about--

00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:22.810
so the fitness of the
1, 1 state was 1.2.

00:28:22.810 --> 00:28:26.860
So you're pointing out
that it's actually easier

00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:29.700
to go from the 0, 1
state to the 1, 1 as

00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:31.645
compared to the
1, 0 to the 1, 1.

00:28:31.645 --> 00:28:34.615
AUDIENCE: Right, which
seems like a reason for why

00:28:34.615 --> 00:28:38.486
we wouldn't care
about [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:38.486 --> 00:28:39.610
PROFESSOR: Yeah, OK, right.

00:28:39.610 --> 00:28:43.810
So if anything,
in some ways, this

00:28:43.810 --> 00:28:46.590
actually provides a bias
going towards the 0, 1 state,

00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:49.456
because it's saying that
if we do get to 0, 1,

00:28:49.456 --> 00:28:51.080
it's actually easier
to move forward as

00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:52.324
compared to this other path.

00:28:52.324 --> 00:28:53.990
In practice, it doesn't
actually matter,

00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:56.890
because this acts as a ratchet.

00:28:56.890 --> 00:28:59.220
Because all these
mutations are non-neutral,

00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:03.660
once you fix this state or
this one, you can't go back.

00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:05.980
So the population
will move forward

00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:07.835
once it gets to one
of those two states.

00:29:07.835 --> 00:29:09.960
Now I mean, it would be a
very interesting question

00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:14.920
to ask if we instead did
a different arrangement.

00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:18.060
What would the rate of
evolution be, and so forth?

00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:21.690
Yeah, but what you're
saying is certainly true,

00:29:21.690 --> 00:29:24.360
that if this took up all
of the benefit going here,

00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:25.957
then it may not
actually be somehow

00:29:25.957 --> 00:29:28.540
an optimal path in terms of the
rate of evolution or something

00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:29.039
like that.

00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:34.510
I'll think about
that when designing.

00:29:34.510 --> 00:29:36.848
Problems.

00:29:36.848 --> 00:29:42.560
AUDIENCE: In this system, 0,
0 eventually becomes 1, 1.

00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:43.560
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:46.590
AUDIENCE: So the
probability is 1.

00:29:46.590 --> 00:29:50.310
PROFESSOR: That's right,
so we are guaranteed

00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:53.470
that we will eventually evolve
to this peak in the fitness

00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:53.970
landscape.

00:29:53.970 --> 00:29:57.430
And so what we're asking here
is which of these two paths

00:29:57.430 --> 00:29:58.621
is going to be taken.

00:29:58.621 --> 00:30:02.058
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so how
to mathematically prove

00:30:02.058 --> 00:30:06.995
that the system will
go from 0, 0 to 1, 1?

00:30:06.995 --> 00:30:09.120
PROFESSOR: I mean, I feel
like I kind of proved it,

00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:11.411
although I understand that
nothing I said was rigorous.

00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:18.670
And of course, there are
non-zero probabilities

00:30:18.670 --> 00:30:19.620
of going backwards.

00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:22.390
It's just that they are reduced.

00:30:22.390 --> 00:30:24.510
And actually, you can
prove, for those of you

00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:26.580
who are interested
in such things,

00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:31.510
that over long time
scales, there's

00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:34.260
going to be an equilibrium
that distribution

00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:40.610
over all these states, where
the probability of being

00:30:40.610 --> 00:30:47.490
in a particular state will--
it goes as the fitness.

00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:52.100
It scales as the relative
fitness to the Nth power.

00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:57.940
So we talk about these
fitness landscapes

00:30:57.940 --> 00:30:59.670
as energy landscapes.

00:30:59.670 --> 00:31:04.760
And indeed, in this regime where
you have small mutation rates,

00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:06.550
then it's going to be
a detailed balance.

00:31:06.550 --> 00:31:08.570
And it's actually a
thermodynamic system.

00:31:08.570 --> 00:31:11.930
So then in that case, you
can make a correspondence

00:31:11.930 --> 00:31:14.210
between everything that
we normally talk about,

00:31:14.210 --> 00:31:18.020
where fitness is like
energy and population

00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:20.720
size is like temperature.

00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:24.610
So the relative amplitude of
being in this peak as compared

00:31:24.610 --> 00:31:27.670
to the other states is
going to be, in this case,

00:31:27.670 --> 00:31:30.150
the ratios of those things
is, indeed, described

00:31:30.150 --> 00:31:33.160
by the ratios of the fitnesses.

00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:38.550
And it's going to go as kind of
like 1.1 to the 1,000th power,

00:31:38.550 --> 00:31:40.690
which is big.

00:31:40.690 --> 00:31:42.760
Which means that the
population has really

00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:47.500
cohered at this peak in
the finished landscape.

00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:48.726
Yeah.

00:31:48.726 --> 00:31:52.386
AUDIENCE: So if you want to
calculate a problem going

00:31:52.386 --> 00:31:57.022
from 0, 1 to 0, 0,
then [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:57.022 --> 00:32:01.440
that would just be--
I guess I'm not sure.

00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:03.225
PROFESSOR: OK, you
want to know the rate

00:32:03.225 --> 00:32:04.080
that that's going to happen.

00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:04.500
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:04.990
PROFESSOR: No, that's fine.

00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:05.690
Let's do that.

00:32:10.170 --> 00:32:13.110
So for example,
let's imagine that we

00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:23.650
don't have-- so let's imagine
that we just have the 0, 0

00:32:23.650 --> 00:32:28.190
and the 0, 1 states, just
so we don't have to worry

00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:29.980
about going up the landscape.

00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:38.090
And so what we have is we have r
is relative fitness 1 and 1.02.

00:32:38.090 --> 00:32:41.200
Now what we want to do
is we want to ask, well,

00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:44.390
what is the rate of
going back and forth?

00:32:44.390 --> 00:32:51.620
Well, so the rate
of going forward,

00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:55.760
well, we sample
mutations at a rate mu.

00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:57.980
And this is mu only
for this one state,

00:32:57.980 --> 00:33:02.270
because pretend that we're not
going to mutate this other one.

00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:07.580
So rate mu N, you have
mutations appearing.

00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:10.789
And times this s, 0.02,
is the probability

00:33:10.789 --> 00:33:12.830
that it'll actually fix
in the forward direction.

00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:19.700
And now what we want to know
is the rate of coming back.

00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:21.720
Well, the beginning
part's the same,

00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:25.640
because we have mu N
is the rate that you

00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:27.970
get this deleterious
mutant in the population.

00:33:27.970 --> 00:33:30.595
But then we need to multiply it
by the probability of fixation.

00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:36.630
And the probability
of fixation is--

00:33:36.630 --> 00:33:43.290
there was this thing X1, which
was 1 minus-- now this is r,

00:33:43.290 --> 00:33:45.670
but it's r in the other
direction, so be careful.

00:33:45.670 --> 00:33:47.550
Because the general
equation was 1 over.

00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:55.750
But now r, instead of
being 1.02, is 1/1.02.

00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:05.000
So which of these terms
is going to be dominant?

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.540
This thing gets up to be
some really big number

00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:09.090
is our problem.

00:34:09.090 --> 00:34:11.780
So we should be able to
figure this out, though.

00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:14.389
Because this new r is 1/1.02.

00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:21.300
So we for example, have 1
minus 1.02, 1 minus 1.02

00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:24.754
to the 1,000.

00:34:24.754 --> 00:34:26.420
All right, so this
is a negative number,

00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:27.878
but this is a
negative number, too.

00:34:27.878 --> 00:34:37.925
So we end up with 0.02--

00:34:37.925 --> 00:34:39.280
AUDIENCE: 200.

00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:41.550
PROFESSOR: Is it 200?

00:34:41.550 --> 00:34:44.139
Yeah, you're keeping
only the first,

00:34:44.139 --> 00:34:47.000
which, since it's much larger
than 1, it's bigger than 200.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:47.500
Right?

00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:50.480
I mean do you guys
understand what I'm saying?

00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:52.550
You can't keep just the
first term in a series.

00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:57.070
If the terms grow with number.

00:34:57.070 --> 00:35:02.340
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
squared, 3.98 or something.

00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:03.948
PROFESSOR: Wait, which one?

00:35:03.948 --> 00:35:07.760
AUDIENCE: 1.02 to the 1,000.

00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:08.800
PROFESSOR: It's 4?

00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:11.440
OK, all right.

00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:15.040
OK, so it's 1 minus 4.

00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:21.200
So it's 2/300.

00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:26.430
OK, so this is teamwork, right?

00:35:26.430 --> 00:35:30.859
OK, so there's less than a
1% probability of it fixing.

00:35:30.859 --> 00:35:31.650
Is this believable?

00:35:37.592 --> 00:35:39.972
AUDIENCE: It's about right.

00:35:39.972 --> 00:35:47.055
PROFESSOR: 2,
1,000, 50-- I think

00:35:47.055 --> 00:35:52.465
that you did it 1.02 to the 100
rather than 1.02 to the 1,000.

00:35:52.465 --> 00:35:54.900
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:56.330
PROFESSOR: No?

00:35:56.330 --> 00:35:57.987
Do you not have it
in front of you?

00:35:57.987 --> 00:35:59.448
AUDIENCE: No, it's
3-- [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:02.857 --> 00:36:05.407
AUDIENCE: 4 times 10 to the 8.

00:36:05.407 --> 00:36:07.240
AUDIENCE: I never thought
that my calculator

00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:08.710
would become so controversial.

00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:10.126
AUDIENCE: Oh, 4
times 10 to the 8.

00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:21.080
PROFESSOR: Yes, sorry,
I was just saying this

00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:23.580
doesn't-- so this is why I'm
saying you always check to make

00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:26.900
sure that your calculation
makes any sense at all.

00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:29.780
So it's not this.

00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:31.817
But it's tiny, right?

00:36:31.817 --> 00:36:34.620
AUDIENCE: Yes, [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:36.620
PROFESSOR: Yeah, because
this didn't make sense,

00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:39.520
because this was of the
same order as-- well,

00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:43.772
this would be larger than 1 over
N, so it's totally nonsensical.

00:36:43.772 --> 00:36:45.980
Because 1 over N would be
the probability of fixation

00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:47.050
of a neutral mutation.

00:36:47.050 --> 00:36:49.182
This is a deleterious mutation.

00:36:49.182 --> 00:36:50.390
It's not even nearly neutral.

00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:54.481
So it has to be much less
than 1 over N, right?

00:36:54.481 --> 00:36:58.317
So this whole thing
is 10 to the minus 10,

00:36:58.317 --> 00:36:59.275
or something like that?

00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:08.309
OK, 4 times 10 to the minus 8.

00:37:08.309 --> 00:37:09.100
Well, OK, whatever.

00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:12.630
It's 10 to the minus 9.

00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:14.440
It's something small.

00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:18.080
So this times the probability of
fixation, which is 10 minus 9--

00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:20.607
this is how you would calculate
the rate of going backwards.

00:37:20.607 --> 00:37:22.440
There's some rate that
the mutation appears,

00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:24.450
and you multiply by the
probability that it would fix.

00:37:24.450 --> 00:37:25.120
And it's tiny.

00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:30.020
OK?

00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:34.950
All right, any other
questions about how

00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:37.120
to think about these sorts
of evolutionary dynamics

00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:40.594
with presence of mutation,
fixation, everything?

00:37:40.594 --> 00:37:41.814
Yeah.

00:37:41.814 --> 00:37:43.272
AUDIENCE: Can we
handle a situation

00:37:43.272 --> 00:37:48.350
where [INAUDIBLE] interference
is important at this point?

00:37:48.350 --> 00:37:51.150
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so this is
what you do in your problem set

00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:54.090
with simulations.

00:37:54.090 --> 00:37:54.590
Yeah.

00:37:54.590 --> 00:37:55.923
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] numerical.

00:37:55.923 --> 00:37:59.780
PROFESSOR: You know,
I think that it

00:37:59.780 --> 00:38:01.988
gets really messy with clonal
interference, I'll say.

00:38:01.988 --> 00:38:05.059
AUDIENCE: But,
like, with basic--

00:38:05.059 --> 00:38:07.308
I guess I was thinking about
it and you could probably

00:38:07.308 --> 00:38:10.284
imagine that [INAUDIBLE]
calculate the probability

00:38:10.284 --> 00:38:14.760
that 1, 0 doesn't arise first.

00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:17.500
PROFESSOR: Right, yeah, OK,
this is an important statement.

00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:20.850
In the limit, as you get
more and more mutations, when

00:38:20.850 --> 00:38:22.600
clonal interference
is really significant,

00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:24.224
then you're pretty
much just guaranteed

00:38:24.224 --> 00:38:25.600
to take the 1, 0 path.

00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:29.037
Because if you
have many mutants,

00:38:29.037 --> 00:38:30.870
the definition of clonal
interference is you

00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:33.332
have multiple mutations
that have established.

00:38:33.332 --> 00:38:35.040
And once you have
multiple mutations that

00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:37.350
have established, then it's
likely that one of them

00:38:37.350 --> 00:38:38.520
is going to be this.

00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:41.957
And if it's established,
it's going to win.

00:38:41.957 --> 00:38:44.540
But the other thing is that as
you go up in the mutation rate,

00:38:44.540 --> 00:38:47.260
you don't even do
successive fixations.

00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:50.785
So it may be that neither
state ever actually fixes,

00:38:50.785 --> 00:38:52.410
because it could be
that the 1, 0 state

00:38:52.410 --> 00:38:55.100
is growing exponentially, but
is a minority of the population.

00:38:55.100 --> 00:38:57.740
And it gets another mutation
that allows it to go to 1, 1.

00:38:57.740 --> 00:39:00.000
So as you increase
the mutation rate,

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.450
you don't have to actually
take single steps.

00:39:02.450 --> 00:39:04.730
You can kind of
move through states.

00:39:04.730 --> 00:39:08.760
And there's a whole literature
of the rate at which you

00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:10.410
cross fitness valleys.

00:39:10.410 --> 00:39:12.650
So this is like tunneling
in quantum mechanics or so.

00:39:12.650 --> 00:39:14.275
And it has a lot of
the same behaviors,

00:39:14.275 --> 00:39:17.029
in the sense of exponential
suppression of probabilities

00:39:17.029 --> 00:39:19.570
as a function of the depth and
the width of the valley you're

00:39:19.570 --> 00:39:20.390
trying to traverse.

00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:22.870
And there's some
very nice papers,

00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:25.420
if you're interested in
looking at this stuff.

00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:28.775
And one of them is actually in
the syllabus that I mentioned.

00:39:28.775 --> 00:39:29.900
I'm trying to remember who.

00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:32.020
It was Journal of
Theoretical Biology,

00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:34.629
but I put it on as optional
reading for those of you

00:39:34.629 --> 00:39:35.420
who are interested.

00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:41.505
All right, OK.

00:39:41.505 --> 00:39:43.630
So what I want to do now
is I want to switch gears,

00:39:43.630 --> 00:39:45.330
so we can think about this
evolutionary game theory

00:39:45.330 --> 00:39:45.829
business.

00:39:49.950 --> 00:39:51.830
And I think the
most important thing

00:39:51.830 --> 00:39:54.200
to stress when thinking about
evolutionary game theory

00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:57.721
is just that this point that we
don't need to assume anything

00:39:57.721 --> 00:39:58.470
about rationality.

00:40:02.750 --> 00:40:10.270
Because the puzzles that we like
to give each other in your dorm

00:40:10.270 --> 00:40:13.600
rooms Friday night,
you give these logic

00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:15.850
puzzles to each other.

00:40:15.850 --> 00:40:17.140
Is that-- I don't know.

00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:18.330
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:18.330 --> 00:40:21.330
OK, let me just say, back when I
was in college, that was, like,

00:40:21.330 --> 00:40:23.930
all the cool kids were doing it.

00:40:23.930 --> 00:40:27.600
But in these puzzles, you assume
that there's hyper-rationality.

00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:32.130
You assume that
if this guy knows

00:40:32.130 --> 00:40:33.896
that I did this,
and that, and if I

00:40:33.896 --> 00:40:35.020
did that, he would do that.

00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:36.645
And then you end
up, and then you

00:40:36.645 --> 00:40:38.270
have the villagers
that are jumping off

00:40:38.270 --> 00:40:40.625
cliffs on the seventh day.

00:40:40.625 --> 00:40:42.000
Have you guys done
these puzzles?

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:42.360
No?

00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:42.720
OK.

00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:42.980
All right.

00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:43.480
Well.

00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:45.960
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:49.620
So the point was
that people assume

00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:51.740
that when we're talking
about game theory,

00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:55.320
you have to invoke this
hyper-rationality even

00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:57.060
humans don't engage in.

00:40:57.060 --> 00:40:59.130
And I think that it's
just very important

00:40:59.130 --> 00:41:01.379
to remember that we're talking
about evolutionary game

00:41:01.379 --> 00:41:04.990
theory in the case of,
well, biological evolution.

00:41:04.990 --> 00:41:06.840
You don't assume anything
about rationality.

00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:11.656
Instead, you simply have
mutations that sample

00:41:11.656 --> 00:41:12.530
different strategies.

00:41:17.550 --> 00:41:26.050
And then you have
differences in fitness

00:41:26.050 --> 00:41:29.470
that just lead to evolution
towards the same solutions

00:41:29.470 --> 00:41:31.080
of the game.

00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:36.710
So it's evolution to
the game solutions,

00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:38.710
so the Nash equilibrium,
for example.

00:41:43.020 --> 00:41:45.840
So it's not that we
think that the cells are

00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:50.210
engaging in any sort of
weird puzzle solving.

00:41:50.210 --> 00:41:52.290
Instead, they're just mutations.

00:41:52.290 --> 00:41:56.190
And the more fit individuals
spread in the population.

00:41:56.190 --> 00:41:59.400
And somehow, you evolve to
the same or similar solutions,

00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:02.360
to these Nash equilibria in
the context of game theory.

00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:10.040
And we'll see how this plays
out in a few concrete examples.

00:42:15.130 --> 00:42:20.640
Now, there are always different
ways of looking at these games.

00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:23.579
One thing I want to
stress, though, is that all

00:42:23.579 --> 00:42:25.120
the selection that
we've been talking

00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:29.210
about in the last
few weeks, that all

00:42:29.210 --> 00:42:31.250
is consistent with game
theory in the sense

00:42:31.250 --> 00:42:33.500
that the idea of
the game theory is

00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:36.200
that we allow for
the possibility

00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:38.240
that the fitness of
individuals depends

00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:41.060
upon the rest of the population.

00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:43.200
Whereas in all these
calculations we've been doing,

00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:47.210
I told you, all right, I
just gave you some fitnesses.

00:42:47.210 --> 00:42:50.550
So I said, here we have a 0,
0 state that has some fitness.

00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:53.090
0, 1 has a higher
fitness, and so forth.

00:42:53.090 --> 00:42:56.050
But in general,
these fitness values

00:42:56.050 --> 00:43:00.990
may depend upon what the
population composition is.

00:43:00.990 --> 00:43:03.590
And in that situation, then you
want to use evolutionary game

00:43:03.590 --> 00:43:05.910
theory.

00:43:05.910 --> 00:43:08.870
In many cases,
people just assume

00:43:08.870 --> 00:43:12.950
that you can do something like
this-- that you can describe it

00:43:12.950 --> 00:43:14.290
as some fitness landscape.

00:43:14.290 --> 00:43:17.950
But you can't do that if
there's this frequency-dependent

00:43:17.950 --> 00:43:20.260
selection-- if there's any
sort of evolutionary game

00:43:20.260 --> 00:43:22.340
interactions going on.

00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:27.410
So it's just important.

00:43:27.410 --> 00:43:32.280
If the fitnesses
depend on composition--

00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:34.990
this is the population
composition--

00:43:34.990 --> 00:43:39.610
then you cannot even
define a fitness landscape.

00:43:43.250 --> 00:43:44.430
Then no fitness landscape.

00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:51.120
For example, you can have
situations where the population

00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:54.700
evolves to lower fitness.

00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:56.510
So you can have a
situation where,

00:43:56.510 --> 00:44:00.040
if I tell you individual
0, you measure its growth

00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:05.760
rate, whatnot, its
fitness might be 1.

00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:10.680
So this is genome,
and this is fitness.

00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:13.090
Now, if I go and I
measure the fitness

00:44:13.090 --> 00:44:17.380
of some other individual,
different genome-- so

00:44:17.380 --> 00:44:20.480
another strain of bacteria
or yeast or whatever--

00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:23.650
and you say, oh, well,
its fitness is 1.2.

00:44:23.650 --> 00:44:26.730
So this strain has higher
fitness than this strain.

00:44:26.730 --> 00:44:32.160
Now, it would be very natural
to assume that this strain will

00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:34.380
out-compete this strain.

00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:37.080
And indeed, that's been the
assumption in everything

00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:38.690
we've been talking about.

00:44:38.690 --> 00:44:41.580
But it's not necessarily true.

00:44:41.580 --> 00:44:45.840
And that's the basic insight
of evolutionary game theory,

00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:50.130
is that just knowing the
fitness of a pure population

00:44:50.130 --> 00:44:53.110
is not actually enough
information to know that it's

00:44:53.110 --> 00:44:54.600
going to be selected for.

00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:57.800
Because it's still possible
that in a mixed population,

00:44:57.800 --> 00:45:00.880
the genome 0 may actually
have higher fitness

00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:01.892
than the genome 1.

00:45:06.050 --> 00:45:08.760
And once you kind of
study these things,

00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:10.430
it's kind of clear
that it can happen.

00:45:10.430 --> 00:45:12.800
But then it's easy to
then go back to the lab

00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:13.900
and forget that it's true.

00:45:17.930 --> 00:45:21.933
And so we'll see
how this plays out.

00:45:21.933 --> 00:45:25.790
AUDIENCE: On this game
theory, [INAUDIBLE]?

00:45:25.790 --> 00:45:27.530
PROFESSOR: No.

00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:29.710
That's the other
thing, is that I

00:45:29.710 --> 00:45:31.842
like to just draw these
things as graphs, because I

00:45:31.842 --> 00:45:33.800
think it's much easier
to see what's happening.

00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:35.800
And it's clear that
things can be non-linear.

00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:39.940
But the basic insights
are all intact.

00:45:39.940 --> 00:45:42.800
From my standpoint as kind
of an experimentalist--

00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:47.090
don't forget about
the exam-- I think

00:45:47.090 --> 00:45:50.689
that the more formal
evolutionary game theory

00:45:50.689 --> 00:45:52.730
thing-- these two-player
games that you guys just

00:45:52.730 --> 00:45:56.200
read about-- I think they're
important because they tell you

00:45:56.200 --> 00:46:00.054
what are the possible outcomes
of measurements or of systems,

00:46:00.054 --> 00:46:02.220
even in the most simple
situation where everything's

00:46:02.220 --> 00:46:02.950
linear.

00:46:02.950 --> 00:46:04.700
Now, when things are
not linear, of course

00:46:04.700 --> 00:46:06.530
you can get even
richer dynamics.

00:46:06.530 --> 00:46:10.391
But in practice, you basically
get the categories of outcomes

00:46:10.391 --> 00:46:11.140
that we saw there.

00:46:22.230 --> 00:46:27.350
So maybe what I'll do is--
so what we're going to do

00:46:27.350 --> 00:46:30.380
is think about competition
between two individuals

00:46:30.380 --> 00:46:38.260
A and B. And often, we
talk about these things

00:46:38.260 --> 00:46:41.866
in the context of the two-player
games, where we have A, B, C,

00:46:41.866 --> 00:46:47.390
D. And because this is really
importing the kind of approach,

00:46:47.390 --> 00:46:51.230
or the nomenclature, from
conventional game theory,

00:46:51.230 --> 00:46:54.020
and then immediately applying
it to populations where you just

00:46:54.020 --> 00:46:55.990
assume that all the
individuals have

00:46:55.990 --> 00:46:58.280
equal probability of
interacting with everybody

00:46:58.280 --> 00:46:59.317
in the population.

00:46:59.317 --> 00:47:00.900
So it's what you
would get if you just

00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:04.850
had some two-player game like
they study in game theory,

00:47:04.850 --> 00:47:07.290
but in a population
of 1,000 or whatnot.

00:47:07.290 --> 00:47:09.790
You just made a bunch of
random pairwise interactions.

00:47:09.790 --> 00:47:10.930
You had them play the game.

00:47:10.930 --> 00:47:12.846
And then you had them
do that again over time.

00:47:12.846 --> 00:47:18.550
And then this is the
payouts that you read about

00:47:18.550 --> 00:47:20.577
in Chapter Four are kind
of what would happen

00:47:20.577 --> 00:47:22.410
in that sort of situation,
where everybody's

00:47:22.410 --> 00:47:26.020
interacting with everybody
else with equal probability.

00:47:26.020 --> 00:47:28.450
Now, remember the
way that you read

00:47:28.450 --> 00:47:33.340
this is that, depending upon
the strategy that these guys are

00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:37.590
following, you get
different payouts.

00:47:37.590 --> 00:47:41.990
And normally what we say
is that if this could be,

00:47:41.990 --> 00:47:45.350
for example, strategy one and
two, strategy one and two.

00:47:45.350 --> 00:47:47.880
And this is telling
us about the payout

00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:50.670
that the A individual gets
depending on what he does,

00:47:50.670 --> 00:47:52.986
and depending upon
what his opponent does.

00:47:52.986 --> 00:47:55.360
Now, we're not explicitly
saying what the payout to the B

00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:56.785
individual is,
but we're assuming

00:47:56.785 --> 00:47:59.160
that this is a symmetric game,
so you could figure it out

00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:02.290
by looking at the
opposite entry.

00:48:02.290 --> 00:48:05.710
So if A follows strategy
one, B follows strategy one,

00:48:05.710 --> 00:48:10.420
then individual A
gets little a fitness,

00:48:10.420 --> 00:48:13.030
whereas B also gets
little a fitness,

00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:15.840
because it's a symmetric game.

00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:18.930
So the case it's different is
when we're in the diagonals.

00:48:22.410 --> 00:48:26.240
And from this
framework, you can see

00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:28.470
that there are
going to be already

00:48:28.470 --> 00:48:30.550
a bunch of kind of
non-trivial things

00:48:30.550 --> 00:48:33.470
that can happen, even in this
regime where everything's

00:48:33.470 --> 00:48:35.750
linear.

00:48:35.750 --> 00:48:42.070
And the probably best
well-known of these

00:48:42.070 --> 00:48:50.500
is this Prisoner's
Dilemma, which

00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:53.770
is the standard
model of cooperation

00:48:53.770 --> 00:48:54.949
in the field of game theory.

00:48:54.949 --> 00:48:56.740
So there's a story that
goes along with it.

00:48:56.740 --> 00:49:02.120
It's this idea that-- I'm sure
you guys watch these cop shows,

00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:05.110
where you have the cops
bring in the two accomplices.

00:49:05.110 --> 00:49:07.300
And then they put them
in separate rooms.

00:49:07.300 --> 00:49:09.220
And they tell them
that they have

00:49:09.220 --> 00:49:11.520
to confess to
committing the crime,

00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:13.800
because the guy in the
other room is confessing,

00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:15.300
and if he doesn't
confess, then he's

00:49:15.300 --> 00:49:16.880
going to be in
trouble, et cetera.

00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:20.470
You've seen these cop shows?

00:49:20.470 --> 00:49:23.900
And incidentally,
in these questions,

00:49:23.900 --> 00:49:25.510
when cops are
questioning witnesses,

00:49:25.510 --> 00:49:31.730
they're actually allowed to lie
to the person being questioned,

00:49:31.730 --> 00:49:34.250
which feels a little
bit weird, actually.

00:49:34.250 --> 00:49:35.670
Doesn't it?

00:49:35.670 --> 00:49:37.630
I know, I know, this
is not relevant.

00:49:40.459 --> 00:49:42.000
So the idea of the
prisoner's dilemma

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:46.787
is that if you set up these
jail sentences in the right way,

00:49:46.787 --> 00:49:48.870
then it could be the case
that each individual has

00:49:48.870 --> 00:49:52.260
the incentive to confess, even
though both individuals would

00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:57.200
be better off if
they cooperated.

00:49:57.200 --> 00:50:01.132
And you can come up with some
reasonable payout structure

00:50:01.132 --> 00:50:02.090
that has that property.

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:24.515
And we'll call this-- so
this is for individual one,

00:50:24.515 --> 00:50:26.010
say and individual two.

00:50:26.010 --> 00:50:29.550
So there are different
strategies you can follow.

00:50:29.550 --> 00:50:32.920
And do you guys remember
from the reading

00:50:32.920 --> 00:50:35.800
slash my explanation how
to read these charts?

00:50:39.460 --> 00:50:44.510
All right, now the question
is, just to remind ourselves,

00:50:44.510 --> 00:50:47.370
what is the Nash
equilibrium of this game?

00:50:51.290 --> 00:50:54.300
And I know that you read
about it last night.

00:50:54.300 --> 00:50:55.640
Well, use your cards.

00:50:55.640 --> 00:50:59.190
Is it C or is it D?

00:50:59.190 --> 00:51:02.910
Or is there no Nash equilibrium,
you can flash something else.

00:51:10.590 --> 00:51:12.520
AUDIENCE: Are those
negative or positive?

00:51:12.520 --> 00:51:14.103
PROFESSOR: These are
positive fitness.

00:51:16.670 --> 00:51:19.970
I kind of don't like the
Prisoner's Dilemma as a story,

00:51:19.970 --> 00:51:22.164
because it's not very
intuitive, because you

00:51:22.164 --> 00:51:23.830
have to actually
specify the jail terms,

00:51:23.830 --> 00:51:25.990
and you have to remember that
jail terms are bad, not good.

00:51:25.990 --> 00:51:27.370
So these are good things, OK?

00:51:27.370 --> 00:51:30.960
These are years off
that you get as a result

00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:32.210
of doing one thing or another.

00:51:35.930 --> 00:51:37.560
You want to get big numbers.

00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:38.360
Ready?

00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:40.220
Three, two, one.

00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:46.980
So at least we have a
majority that are D,

00:51:46.980 --> 00:51:49.270
but it's not all of them.

00:51:49.270 --> 00:51:51.300
And I think this is
basically a reflection--

00:51:51.300 --> 00:51:53.300
and D is indeed the
Nash equilibrium.

00:51:56.550 --> 00:51:58.690
It's to do this strategy
D that we're saying here.

00:51:58.690 --> 00:52:01.060
All right, now the
question is why?

00:52:01.060 --> 00:52:03.320
And part of the challenge
here is just understanding

00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:05.540
how to read these charts.

00:52:05.540 --> 00:52:09.670
Now, first of all, the payout
that everybody gets if everyone

00:52:09.670 --> 00:52:12.130
follows strategy D is what?

00:52:12.130 --> 00:52:14.130
Verbally, three, two, one.

00:52:14.130 --> 00:52:15.170
AUDIENCE: One.

00:52:15.170 --> 00:52:17.440
PROFESSOR: So everybody
gets payout one.

00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:20.100
Now, if you look
at this chart, you

00:52:20.100 --> 00:52:23.410
say, well, gee, that is a shame.

00:52:23.410 --> 00:52:28.900
Because 1 is just not the
biggest number you see here.

00:52:28.900 --> 00:52:30.820
And indeed, the
important point to note

00:52:30.820 --> 00:52:34.670
here is that if both players
had followed this strategy

00:52:34.670 --> 00:52:39.930
C for cooperate, D for defect,
then both individuals would be

00:52:39.930 --> 00:52:43.840
getting fitness 3, or payout 3.

00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:46.550
So the idea here is that
both individuals would

00:52:46.550 --> 00:52:49.140
do better if they both
played strategy C.

00:52:49.140 --> 00:52:51.660
But the problem is that that's
not evolutionarily stable.

00:52:51.660 --> 00:52:53.590
Or in the context
of game theory,

00:52:53.590 --> 00:52:56.770
that is cheatable in some ways.

00:52:56.770 --> 00:52:59.020
And so the reason that
this is a Nash equilibrium

00:52:59.020 --> 00:53:01.890
is that you ask-- so a Nash
equilibrium, what it means,

00:53:01.890 --> 00:53:05.070
if you recall, is
that if everyone's

00:53:05.070 --> 00:53:07.640
playing that strategy, then
nobody has the incentive

00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:09.770
to change strategy.

00:53:09.770 --> 00:53:11.825
So no incentive to
change strategy.

00:53:17.902 --> 00:53:19.360
So now you just
imagine, let's say,

00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:20.390
that you're playing
against somebody else,

00:53:20.390 --> 00:53:22.100
or in the context
of biology, it's

00:53:22.100 --> 00:53:24.746
a population of individuals
following the D strategy.

00:53:24.746 --> 00:53:27.740
The question is whether
you as an individual

00:53:27.740 --> 00:53:32.040
would have the incentive to
switch to the other strategy?

00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:34.830
And the answer is no, because
what you have control over

00:53:34.830 --> 00:53:38.510
is this rows.

00:53:38.510 --> 00:53:41.450
The column is specified by
the rest of the population.

00:53:41.450 --> 00:53:45.095
So if you're in this state,
what you have a choice of

00:53:45.095 --> 00:53:47.612
is to switch to the
cooperate strategy, which

00:53:47.612 --> 00:53:48.570
would be to go up here.

00:53:48.570 --> 00:53:53.890
So you have a choice to
move up to this 0 payout,

00:53:53.890 --> 00:53:55.732
but that's not to
your advantage.

00:53:55.732 --> 00:53:57.940
Now, it's true that your
opponent would get payout 5.

00:53:57.940 --> 00:54:01.170
So you opponent would
actually do wonderfully.

00:54:01.170 --> 00:54:02.370
But you would do poorly.

00:54:02.370 --> 00:54:05.890
So you'd be selected
against, if you imagine

00:54:05.890 --> 00:54:07.980
this being in the
context of biology--

00:54:07.980 --> 00:54:09.990
that you have a genotype
that are playing

00:54:09.990 --> 00:54:13.120
D. If you're a mutant that
starts following this strategy

00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:17.627
C, you have lower fitness,
so you're selected against.

00:54:17.627 --> 00:54:19.835
So that's saying that the
strategy D is noninvadable.

00:54:23.050 --> 00:54:25.040
We can also think about
what happens if we're

00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:28.710
a population of cooperators.

00:54:28.710 --> 00:54:31.251
Now everybody has high
fitness-- fitness 3.

00:54:31.251 --> 00:54:32.750
Question is, what
happens if there's

00:54:32.750 --> 00:54:35.070
a mutation that leads to one
individual following the D

00:54:35.070 --> 00:54:35.570
strategy?

00:54:41.560 --> 00:54:45.426
Is he selected four or not?

00:54:45.426 --> 00:54:46.320
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:48.570
PROFESSOR: Yes,
so the point here

00:54:48.570 --> 00:54:53.410
is that you always will
have higher fitness,

00:54:53.410 --> 00:54:57.010
regardless of what your opponent
does in the context of a game

00:54:57.010 --> 00:54:59.260
theory situation, or
regardless of the distribution

00:54:59.260 --> 00:55:00.910
of cooperation and
defection in the population.

00:55:00.910 --> 00:55:02.410
It's always better
to be a defector.

00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:11.308
So the problem here is, it's
always better to play D.

00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:28.911
Now, I really like drawing
the graphs of these things,

00:55:28.911 --> 00:55:30.660
because I think it's
just much more clear.

00:55:34.770 --> 00:55:37.940
And you can either
draw the fitness

00:55:37.940 --> 00:55:41.860
of the two types minus each
other, or just the raw fitness.

00:55:41.860 --> 00:55:43.086
Yes.

00:55:43.086 --> 00:55:45.537
AUDIENCE: So what if
instead of 5, you have 7?

00:55:45.537 --> 00:55:49.830
Because then the population
as a whole's fitness

00:55:49.830 --> 00:55:54.123
decreases when you [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:54.123 --> 00:55:56.680
So how does that--

00:55:56.680 --> 00:55:59.236
PROFESSOR: So you're saying
if this 5 were a 7 instead?

00:55:59.236 --> 00:55:59.930
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:55:59.930 --> 00:56:01.950
PROFESSOR: Right, then
what you're saying

00:56:01.950 --> 00:56:04.020
is that-- so it doesn't change.

00:56:04.020 --> 00:56:07.940
The Nash equilibrium
is still defect.

00:56:07.940 --> 00:56:13.600
The subtle thing here
is that, in general,

00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:17.180
in terms of game theory, we like
it when the mean of these two

00:56:17.180 --> 00:56:19.437
is smaller than this one.

00:56:19.437 --> 00:56:20.770
That's why you're asking, right?

00:56:20.770 --> 00:56:23.120
Exactly, because that's right.

00:56:23.120 --> 00:56:24.130
Exactly, right.

00:56:24.130 --> 00:56:27.630
So yeah, so that's a slightly
more complicated situation,

00:56:27.630 --> 00:56:31.490
because in that situation, then,
if you had two rational agents,

00:56:31.490 --> 00:56:34.820
say, playing this game, then
you could alternate cooperation

00:56:34.820 --> 00:56:35.940
and defection.

00:56:35.940 --> 00:56:39.060
And that would actually be the
ultimate form of cooperation

00:56:39.060 --> 00:56:42.030
in such a game, because you
could actually get a higher

00:56:42.030 --> 00:56:45.180
payout by alternating.

00:56:45.180 --> 00:56:47.390
Right, so we've
chosen the numbers

00:56:47.390 --> 00:56:54.480
as they are so that this is
subtlety is not an issue.

00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:56.280
Does everybody understand
the issue there?

00:57:00.030 --> 00:57:02.850
So in the context of
evolutionary game theory, what

00:57:02.850 --> 00:57:07.030
we can do is we can plot as
a function of the fraction

00:57:07.030 --> 00:57:10.610
of the population that's
cooperator between 0 and 1,

00:57:10.610 --> 00:57:12.770
say.

00:57:12.770 --> 00:57:16.420
And we can plot the
payout for the cooperator

00:57:16.420 --> 00:57:17.350
and for the defector.

00:57:23.020 --> 00:57:29.510
For example, I'm going to draw
a solid line for the cooperator,

00:57:29.510 --> 00:57:32.450
dashed line for the defector.

00:57:32.450 --> 00:57:39.150
Now the question is, what should
be the y-axes on either ends

00:57:39.150 --> 00:57:39.730
and so forth?

00:57:39.730 --> 00:57:40.479
Do you understand?

00:57:43.030 --> 00:57:45.850
So what should these
things look like?

00:57:45.850 --> 00:57:47.780
I'd like to encourage
you to-- I'll

00:57:47.780 --> 00:57:51.055
give you 30 seconds
to try to draw

00:57:51.055 --> 00:57:52.180
what this should look like.

00:57:52.180 --> 00:57:59.610
So this is the payout
or the expected payout.

00:57:59.610 --> 00:58:03.610
So we're assuming that you're
going to interact randomly

00:58:03.610 --> 00:58:05.860
with the other members of
the population as a function

00:58:05.860 --> 00:58:07.290
of the fraction cooperator.

00:58:07.290 --> 00:58:09.570
So then 1 minus that will
be the fraction defector.

00:58:13.170 --> 00:58:15.321
Do you understand what I'm
trying to ask you to do?

00:58:15.321 --> 00:58:17.966
AUDIENCE: So the scale on
the right-hand side supposed

00:58:17.966 --> 00:58:20.140
to be for the defectors?

00:58:20.140 --> 00:58:21.759
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:58:21.759 --> 00:58:24.050
PROFESSOR: This is just a
legend, or key, or something.

00:58:24.050 --> 00:58:26.630
So I want you to draw
something over here that's

00:58:26.630 --> 00:58:28.030
a solid line and a dashed line.

00:58:28.030 --> 00:58:29.380
AUDIENCE: All right,
so it's just one scale.

00:58:29.380 --> 00:58:30.005
And you don't--

00:58:30.005 --> 00:58:31.088
PROFESSOR: It's one scale.

00:58:31.088 --> 00:58:32.230
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:58:32.230 --> 00:58:34.614
PROFESSOR: Oh, yeah, sorry.

00:58:34.614 --> 00:58:36.780
I'm just telling you what's
going to be a solid line

00:58:36.780 --> 00:58:39.540
and what's going to
be a dashed line.

00:58:39.540 --> 00:58:42.290
And I'll give you a hint,
that up here is number 5.

00:59:23.450 --> 00:59:27.775
This is going to be the expected
payout for a lone individual

00:59:27.775 --> 00:59:29.650
given the rest of the
population is following

00:59:29.650 --> 00:59:31.070
some fraction of cooperator.

01:00:05.630 --> 01:00:08.136
Do you guys understand
what I'm asking you to do?

01:00:08.136 --> 01:00:10.010
Because I'm a little
bit concerned that there

01:00:10.010 --> 01:00:14.706
are very few plots in front.

01:00:14.706 --> 01:00:16.020
AUDIENCE: What is fc?

01:00:16.020 --> 01:00:17.660
PROFESSOR: So this is the
fraction of the population

01:00:17.660 --> 01:00:18.409
that's cooperator.

01:00:40.700 --> 01:00:44.530
Well, I was giving you a
chance to think about it.

01:00:44.530 --> 01:00:46.930
But from looking around,
I think that maybe you're

01:00:46.930 --> 01:00:48.960
not quite sure what I'm
trying to ask you to do.

01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:50.964
So I'm trying to plot
the expected payout

01:00:50.964 --> 01:00:53.380
for an individual that is
either cooperating or defecting,

01:00:53.380 --> 01:00:55.421
based on the fact that
the rest of the population

01:00:55.421 --> 01:01:00.590
has some composition between
all cooperate or all defect.

01:01:00.590 --> 01:01:03.170
So it's the evolution
game theory extension

01:01:03.170 --> 01:01:06.460
of this simple model.

01:01:06.460 --> 01:01:11.360
So first, we can ask, well,
if the entire population is

01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:15.460
cooperating, we want to know
the fitness for a cooperator

01:01:15.460 --> 01:01:16.000
or defector.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:20.710
Well, this is really
just saying that we're

01:01:20.710 --> 01:01:25.190
all the way over on here, and
we just choose between the two.

01:01:25.190 --> 01:01:27.250
And the defector is the 5 one.

01:01:27.250 --> 01:01:30.390
So this is going to be
a dashed line that's

01:01:30.390 --> 01:01:31.880
going to start from here.

01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:33.530
And then this is 2 and 1/2, 3.

01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:40.435
So this is cooperator starts
here, and defector starts here.

01:01:40.435 --> 01:01:43.390
Do you understand what I'm?

01:01:43.390 --> 01:01:45.290
Now, OK, let's see.

01:01:45.290 --> 01:01:48.740
So now this is the one where
if everybody else is defecting,

01:01:48.740 --> 01:01:51.250
well, now, the cooperator
line goes to what?

01:01:51.250 --> 01:01:54.160
Verbally, three, two, one.

01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:54.740
AUDIENCE: 0.

01:01:54.740 --> 01:01:56.900
PROFESSOR: 0.

01:01:56.900 --> 01:01:58.410
The defector line goes to 1.

01:02:09.310 --> 01:02:11.640
OK, that line, I started
going the wrong direction,

01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:13.370
but that's supposed
to be a line.

01:02:15.940 --> 01:02:18.020
So this is an
example of what this

01:02:18.020 --> 01:02:20.914
looks like for the
Prisoner's Dilemma.

01:02:20.914 --> 01:02:22.580
And what you see is
the defector fitness

01:02:22.580 --> 01:02:25.180
is always above the
cooperator fitness.

01:02:25.180 --> 01:02:27.502
So for any population
composition,

01:02:27.502 --> 01:02:29.460
defectors have higher
fitness than cooperators.

01:02:29.460 --> 01:02:34.630
So evolution brings you to
the pure defecting state,

01:02:34.630 --> 01:02:36.170
where you have fitness 1.

01:02:40.001 --> 01:02:41.500
And if you want,
you could calculate

01:02:41.500 --> 01:02:45.230
what the mean fitness of the
population is, for example.

01:02:45.230 --> 01:02:48.400
And the mean fitness
starts out over here,

01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:49.830
and ends up over here.

01:02:49.830 --> 01:02:51.930
So the mean fitness
decreases over time.

01:02:54.610 --> 01:03:01.240
Now, you can imagine that in
the simple, two-player models,

01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:02.590
all these are lines.

01:03:02.590 --> 01:03:04.970
But you can imagine that the
only thing that's important

01:03:04.970 --> 01:03:09.340
are how these lines
cross each other.

01:03:09.340 --> 01:03:12.090
So for example, there are
only a few different things

01:03:12.090 --> 01:03:14.160
that can happen.

01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:24.260
You can have one
strategy that dominates,

01:03:24.260 --> 01:03:26.660
which is what occurred here.

01:03:26.660 --> 01:03:29.240
And surprisingly,
that does not mean

01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:32.290
that that strategy
is higher fitness,

01:03:32.290 --> 01:03:36.070
in the sense that you may evolve
to a state of low fitness.

01:03:36.070 --> 01:03:37.166
That's what's weird.

01:03:37.166 --> 01:03:43.930
You can have coexistence, or
you can have bi-stability.

01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:53.175
So I'll give you
another example of this.

01:03:59.420 --> 01:04:01.990
So now we're just going
to have two strategies.

01:04:01.990 --> 01:04:07.516
The strategies-- we'll
just call them A and B.

01:04:11.460 --> 01:04:16.045
And the question is, what
is the Nash equilibrium?

01:04:22.620 --> 01:04:34.500
Is it A, B, or C should
be neither, D is both.

01:04:34.500 --> 01:04:35.950
Do you understand?

01:04:35.950 --> 01:04:38.950
I'm going to ask, because
if this is the game

01:04:38.950 --> 01:04:41.670
and this is the interaction,
is the Nash equilibrium A,

01:04:41.670 --> 01:04:43.400
Nash equilibrium B?

01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:47.240
If you vote C, it means
neither, D means both.

01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:50.590
Do you understand the question?

01:04:50.590 --> 01:04:53.474
I'll give you 30 seconds
to think about it.

01:05:38.660 --> 01:05:44.670
All right, are we ready to vote?

01:05:44.670 --> 01:05:47.935
Ready, three, two, one.

01:05:53.621 --> 01:05:55.370
All right, so we have
a fair distribution.

01:05:55.370 --> 01:06:01.250
I may not have us vote,
but yeah, in this case,

01:06:01.250 --> 01:06:04.970
they're actually
both Nash equilibria.

01:06:04.970 --> 01:06:06.500
So let's see this.

01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:09.290
If both individuals, or
an entire population,

01:06:09.290 --> 01:06:13.000
say, is playing A,
they're getting fitness 5.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.790
Question is, as a
lone individual,

01:06:14.790 --> 01:06:17.720
you can choose to switch
over and get fitness 3.

01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:19.610
Do you want to do that?

01:06:19.610 --> 01:06:21.150
No.

01:06:21.150 --> 01:06:23.510
So that means that A is going
to be a Nash equilibrium.

01:06:23.510 --> 01:06:25.010
Incidentally, the
difference between

01:06:25.010 --> 01:06:27.780
the so-called regular Nash
equilibrium and the strict Nash

01:06:27.780 --> 01:06:32.050
equilibrium is that
Nash equilibrium

01:06:32.050 --> 01:06:35.630
means that no individual has the
incentive to change strategy.

01:06:35.630 --> 01:06:40.860
A strict Nash equilibrium means
that any change in strategy

01:06:40.860 --> 01:06:42.800
leads to an actual
decrease in fitness.

01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:45.920
So it's a question of whether
you can make neutral changes

01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:47.690
in strategy or not.

01:06:47.690 --> 01:06:48.440
Do you understand?

01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:54.540
So A is a Nash equilibrium.

01:06:54.540 --> 01:06:55.570
What about B?

01:06:55.570 --> 01:06:59.530
Well, in that case, everybody's
getting to fitness 1.

01:06:59.530 --> 01:07:02.980
Now, as a lone individual,
what can you do?

01:07:02.980 --> 01:07:04.850
All you can do is switch.

01:07:04.850 --> 01:07:07.050
As an individual, you
can only choose rows.

01:07:07.050 --> 01:07:08.260
So you go up to 0.

01:07:08.260 --> 01:07:09.950
That's a decrease of fitness.

01:07:09.950 --> 01:07:14.530
So that means that strategy
B is also a Nash equilibrium.

01:07:17.410 --> 01:07:19.450
So there are two Nash
equilibria in this game.

01:07:19.450 --> 01:07:21.850
And what does that
mean about which regime

01:07:21.850 --> 01:07:25.830
you're in here, if you convert
this into an evolutionary game

01:07:25.830 --> 01:07:27.075
theory scenario?

01:07:37.460 --> 01:07:41.700
Ready, three, two, one.

01:07:41.700 --> 01:07:43.550
OK, so a majority is saying yes.

01:07:43.550 --> 01:07:47.130
This is indeed a situation in
which you have bi-stability.

01:07:50.030 --> 01:07:53.417
So what does that mean in terms
of these lines if we draw them?

01:07:57.730 --> 01:08:07.130
So this is payout as a
function of the fraction that

01:08:07.130 --> 01:08:08.555
is playing the A strategy.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:13.100
Should the lines cross?

01:08:13.100 --> 01:08:13.620
Yes or no?

01:08:13.620 --> 01:08:15.997
Ready, three, two, one.

01:08:15.997 --> 01:08:16.580
AUDIENCE: Yes.

01:08:16.580 --> 01:08:20.898
PROFESSOR: Yes, and
indeed, in principle,

01:08:20.898 --> 01:08:22.689
the math that we do in
all these situations

01:08:22.689 --> 01:08:25.319
is kind of super simple.

01:08:25.319 --> 01:08:28.540
Yet it's easy to get confused
about what's going on

01:08:28.540 --> 01:08:29.770
in all these situations.

01:08:29.770 --> 01:08:33.930
So the idea here is that if
the population is A, that

01:08:33.930 --> 01:08:37.044
means that the A here is at 5.

01:08:41.390 --> 01:08:42.694
But then it goes down to 0.

01:08:47.140 --> 01:08:50.448
Whereas over here, B here is 3.

01:08:50.448 --> 01:08:51.364
And then it goes to 1.

01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:01.960
Because these two
lines cross, does that

01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:06.970
mean that you have bi-stability?

01:09:06.970 --> 01:09:10.278
Ready, yes or no,
three, two, one,

01:09:10.278 --> 01:09:10.819
AUDIENCE: No.

01:09:10.819 --> 01:09:13.780
PROFESSOR: No, and why not?

01:09:13.780 --> 01:09:15.210
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:09:15.210 --> 01:09:16.120
PROFESSOR: That's right,
because you can also

01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:18.411
do the other thing, and then
that leads to coexistence.

01:09:22.310 --> 01:09:26.270
Now, in some ways coexistence
is the most subtle

01:09:26.270 --> 01:09:27.580
of the situations.

01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:30.955
And that's for an
interesting reason.

01:09:30.955 --> 01:09:32.746
AUDIENCE: Sorry, sir,
you said you can also

01:09:32.746 --> 01:09:33.537
do the other thing.

01:09:33.537 --> 01:09:34.830
What is the other thing here?

01:09:37.398 --> 01:09:39.189
PROFESSOR: I'm saying
that these things can

01:09:39.189 --> 01:09:42.250
cross in the other orientation.

01:09:42.250 --> 01:09:52.734
Let me put a matrix
out there, and then--

01:09:52.734 --> 01:09:56.130
so this is something that,
for example, is what's

01:09:56.130 --> 01:09:57.480
known as a Hawk/Dove game.

01:09:57.480 --> 01:09:58.755
Or it has many other names.

01:10:12.341 --> 01:10:14.840
And we can maybe figure out
what would be the Hawk strategy,

01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:16.048
and what's the Dove strategy.

01:10:19.710 --> 01:10:23.080
Now, we want to ask the
same question-- is A a Nash

01:10:23.080 --> 01:10:23.630
equilibrium?

01:10:23.630 --> 01:10:25.480
Is B a Nash equilibrium?

01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:26.440
Is it neither?

01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:27.300
Or is it both?

01:10:27.300 --> 01:10:30.104
And maybe I shouldn't
have covered this up,

01:10:30.104 --> 01:10:32.020
so you're not influenced,
in case you actually

01:10:32.020 --> 01:10:34.290
did do the reading.

01:10:34.290 --> 01:10:37.090
Then I don't want to you
to be influenced by this.

01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:42.590
So think about it
for 30 seconds.

01:11:09.430 --> 01:11:11.047
Do you need more time?

01:11:11.047 --> 01:11:12.130
Let's go see where we are.

01:11:12.130 --> 01:11:16.650
Ready, three, two, one.

01:11:16.650 --> 01:11:19.200
All right, so most of the
group is agreeing in this case,

01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:21.320
neither are the
Nash equilibrium.

01:11:24.590 --> 01:11:29.320
So neither are a
Nash equilibrium.

01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:32.810
Does that mean that this
game has no Nash equilibrium?

01:11:32.810 --> 01:11:36.556
Yes or no, verbally--
ready, three, two, one.

01:11:36.556 --> 01:11:37.270
AUDIENCE: No.

01:11:37.270 --> 01:11:39.140
PROFESSOR: No, it
does not mean that.

01:11:39.140 --> 01:11:40.920
This game has a
Nash equilibrium.

01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:43.505
And indeed, all games like
this have Nash equilibria.

01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:49.270
And this is what Nash
won the Nobel Prize for,

01:11:49.270 --> 01:11:53.660
so this is the famous one-page
paper published in PNAS.

01:11:53.660 --> 01:11:56.500
If you look at it, I have
no idea what it says.

01:12:00.510 --> 01:12:03.930
I mean, he basically
just pointed out

01:12:03.930 --> 01:12:07.950
that this theorem implies
this, implies that-- done.

01:12:07.950 --> 01:12:14.390
And so it's good that somebody
knew what he was saying,

01:12:14.390 --> 01:12:17.050
otherwise we'd be in
trouble, all of us.

01:12:17.050 --> 01:12:20.760
So what he proved
is that such games,

01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:26.050
even with more players,
more options, and so forth,

01:12:26.050 --> 01:12:30.860
they always have such a
solution in this sense.

01:12:30.860 --> 01:12:32.870
There exists some strategy
such as if everybody

01:12:32.870 --> 01:12:34.870
were playing in, nobody
would have the incentive

01:12:34.870 --> 01:12:36.290
to change strategy.

01:12:36.290 --> 01:12:39.330
But you have to include
so-called probabilistic or

01:12:39.330 --> 01:12:40.180
mixed strategies.

01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:49.350
And we can draw
what this thing is.

01:12:49.350 --> 01:12:53.590
So just like always, so
everyone else is following A,

01:12:53.590 --> 01:12:55.045
then A starts here at 3.

01:12:58.170 --> 01:12:59.660
And then it goes to 1.

01:13:04.010 --> 01:13:07.830
Whereas the B individuals
start at 5, and they go to 0.

01:13:14.220 --> 01:13:17.530
So this looks very
similar to that,

01:13:17.530 --> 01:13:19.720
but they're rather
different, in the sense

01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:26.120
that in this situation,
we had bi-stability.

01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:31.410
So if you look at the
direction of evolution,

01:13:31.410 --> 01:13:32.970
depending upon
where you start, you

01:13:32.970 --> 01:13:36.330
go to either all B
or all A. Whereas

01:13:36.330 --> 01:13:41.210
in this situation over
here, we have coexistence.

01:13:41.210 --> 01:13:42.840
Does not matter where you start.

01:13:42.840 --> 01:13:44.940
So long as you have some
members of both A and B

01:13:44.940 --> 01:13:47.810
in the population, you'll always
evolve to the same equilibrium.

01:13:47.810 --> 01:13:50.860
Now, the important thing
here that's, I think,

01:13:50.860 --> 01:13:54.220
interesting is that
in a population,

01:13:54.220 --> 01:13:57.430
if you have genetic A's and
genetic B's that are each

01:13:57.430 --> 01:14:00.840
giving birth to
their own type, then

01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:05.020
you evolve to some
coexistence of genotypes.

01:14:05.020 --> 01:14:08.020
So here, this is some fraction.

01:14:08.020 --> 01:14:17.677
f a star is the equilibrium
fraction, fraction

01:14:17.677 --> 01:14:18.635
of A in the population.

01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:25.320
So this is a case where you
have genetic diversity that

01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:28.590
leads to phenotypic
diversity in the population.

01:14:28.590 --> 01:14:34.430
Whereas the mixed Nash
equilibrium-- this

01:14:34.430 --> 01:14:37.560
is a situation where
you have, in principle,

01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:41.020
genetic homogeneity.

01:14:41.020 --> 01:14:48.849
So this is a single genotype
that is implementing

01:14:48.849 --> 01:14:49.890
phenotypic heterogeneity.

01:14:58.174 --> 01:14:59.840
And indeed, one of
the things that we've

01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:01.860
been excited about
exploring in my group

01:15:01.860 --> 01:15:09.160
is this distinction here, where
it's known that in many cases,

01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:12.360
isogenic populations
of microbes can exhibit

01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:15.100
a diversity of phenotypes
as a result of, for example,

01:15:15.100 --> 01:15:17.555
stochastic gene expression
and bi-stability.

01:15:21.150 --> 01:15:23.230
So that's a molecular
mechanism for how

01:15:23.230 --> 01:15:25.400
you might get heterogeneity.

01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:28.280
Another question is, what
is the evolution explanation

01:15:28.280 --> 01:15:31.140
for why that behavior
might have evolved?

01:15:31.140 --> 01:15:33.820
Now in general, we cannot
prove why something evolved,

01:15:33.820 --> 01:15:37.390
but we can make educated
guesses that make experimentally

01:15:37.390 --> 01:15:38.684
testable hypotheses.

01:15:38.684 --> 01:15:40.100
And for example,
in the experiment

01:15:40.100 --> 01:15:44.360
that we've been doing, we've
been looking at bi-modality

01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:48.230
in expression of the
galactose genes in yeast.

01:15:48.230 --> 01:15:53.815
And that was still a
problem set in early-- oh,

01:15:53.815 --> 01:15:55.700
no, we removed
that one this year.

01:15:55.700 --> 01:16:02.880
Well, so experimentally
yeast, in some environments,

01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:04.840
bimodally or
stochastically activate

01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:07.470
the genes required to break
down the sugar galactose.

01:16:07.470 --> 01:16:09.600
And what we've
demonstrated is that if you

01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:13.590
make the mutants that always
turn on or always don't

01:16:13.590 --> 01:16:16.160
turn on these genes, then
they're actually playing game

01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:20.050
where you actually get
this exact thing-- where

01:16:20.050 --> 01:16:22.640
you get evolution towards
coexistence of those two

01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:23.740
strategies.

01:16:23.740 --> 01:16:26.070
So that's saying that
maybe the wild type that

01:16:26.070 --> 01:16:29.270
follows this stochastic,
mixed strategy-- it

01:16:29.270 --> 01:16:32.210
may be implementing the
solution of some game that

01:16:32.210 --> 01:16:34.640
is a result of such
frequency dependence.

01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:36.720
There are other possible
explanations to this.

01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:38.760
In the coming weeks,
we'll talk about this idea

01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:41.801
of bet hedging-- that given
uncertain or fluctuating

01:16:41.801 --> 01:16:43.300
environments, it
may be advantageous

01:16:43.300 --> 01:16:46.520
for clonal populations to have a
variety of different strategies

01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:47.890
to cope with that uncertainty.

01:16:47.890 --> 01:16:50.225
So we'll talk about
those models later.

01:16:50.225 --> 01:16:52.350
But since we're talking
about mixed strategies now,

01:16:52.350 --> 01:16:53.647
I wanted to mention that.

01:16:53.647 --> 01:16:54.810
Yeah.

01:16:54.810 --> 01:16:56.658
AUDIENCE: So f a
star, just to be sure,

01:16:56.658 --> 01:16:59.440
is going to converge to this
probability [INAUDIBLE]?

01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:04.380
PROFESSOR: Exactly, so the
Nash equilibrium mixed strategy

01:17:04.380 --> 01:17:08.680
plays A with probability--
so it's p should

01:17:08.680 --> 01:17:10.020
be equal to f a star.

01:17:13.260 --> 01:17:16.710
Exactly, so indeed,
the heterogeneity there

01:17:16.710 --> 01:17:19.980
can be implemented either way.

01:17:19.980 --> 01:17:22.516
It's either coexistence
of genotypes following

01:17:22.516 --> 01:17:23.890
different strategies,
or it could

01:17:23.890 --> 01:17:25.587
be one genotype
implementing both,

01:17:25.587 --> 01:17:27.420
or it could be a mixture
of those, actually.

01:17:27.420 --> 01:17:30.670
Indeed, a characteristic
of these situations

01:17:30.670 --> 01:17:38.070
is that, let's say that you have
a genotype-- a population has

01:17:38.070 --> 01:17:40.810
this genotype that is
implementing the mixed Nash

01:17:40.810 --> 01:17:44.680
equilibrium choosing strategy
A with probability p.

01:17:44.680 --> 01:17:46.400
That's that
equilibrium fraction.

01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:49.530
What's interesting is
that any individual

01:17:49.530 --> 01:17:54.850
in the population following any
strategy has the same fitness.

01:17:54.850 --> 01:17:58.280
And of course, that's kind of
why this was in equilibrium.

01:17:58.280 --> 01:18:01.295
This equilibrium is when the two
strategies have equal fitness.

01:18:01.295 --> 01:18:02.920
But the funny thing
is, what that means

01:18:02.920 --> 01:18:05.137
is, it doesn't matter what
you do at the equilibrium.

01:18:05.137 --> 01:18:06.970
Depending on how you
look at it, it's either

01:18:06.970 --> 01:18:09.030
super deep or super trivial.

01:18:09.030 --> 01:18:11.630
But it's a weird thing that
if your at the equilibrium,

01:18:11.630 --> 01:18:13.520
or if the population
or the opponent

01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:15.942
is playing this Nash
equilibrium in these games,

01:18:15.942 --> 01:18:17.650
then it just does not
matter what you do.

01:18:17.650 --> 01:18:21.920
You can do A. You can do B,
actually, in any fraction.

01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:23.810
So since A and B have
the same fitness,

01:18:23.810 --> 01:18:26.480
you can choose between them
at any frequency you want,

01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:29.270
and you have the same fitness,
if the rest of the population

01:18:29.270 --> 01:18:33.330
is playing this mixed
Nash equilibrium.

01:18:33.330 --> 01:18:37.490
And indeed, in this
there are nice conditions

01:18:37.490 --> 01:18:42.070
for what makes it
this Nash equilibrium.

01:18:42.070 --> 01:18:46.770
And I'm going to just highlight
that you should make sense

01:18:46.770 --> 01:18:49.910
of why it means what it is.

01:18:49.910 --> 01:18:54.690
So if the payout, the
expected fitness or payout--

01:18:54.690 --> 01:18:56.820
if you're following
the Nash equilibrium

01:18:56.820 --> 01:19:03.890
against Nash equilibrium--
is equal to this guy.

01:19:03.890 --> 01:19:07.230
So that's what I
just said-- that it

01:19:07.230 --> 01:19:09.700
doesn't matter what you do.

01:19:09.700 --> 01:19:11.490
If everyone else
is doing p star,

01:19:11.490 --> 01:19:14.370
you have the same fitness.

01:19:14.370 --> 01:19:16.360
So that's saying it's
a Nash equilibrium.

01:19:19.430 --> 01:19:22.980
Whereas there's another
interesting kind of statement

01:19:22.980 --> 01:19:25.010
here, that--

01:19:25.010 --> 01:19:27.435
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

01:19:27.435 --> 01:19:30.587
That you can't unilaterally
increase your fitness

01:19:30.587 --> 01:19:32.770
by switching.

01:19:32.770 --> 01:19:34.900
PROFESSOR: Right, it's
an equality, which

01:19:34.900 --> 01:19:36.250
means it is a Nash equilibrium.

01:19:36.250 --> 01:19:38.599
Because it's saying that
you don't have the incentive

01:19:38.599 --> 01:19:39.390
to change strategy.

01:19:39.390 --> 01:19:42.080
It's true that you're
not dis-incentivized.

01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:43.810
So it's a Nash equilibrium.

01:19:43.810 --> 01:19:45.914
It's not a strict
Nash equilibrium.

01:19:45.914 --> 01:19:46.830
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:19:50.754 --> 01:19:52.920
PROFESSOR: Well, it has to
be greater than/equal to,

01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:55.084
and it's actually equal to.

01:19:55.084 --> 01:19:57.250
The condition it has to be
greater than or equal to,

01:19:57.250 --> 01:20:00.239
but it's equal to, which means
it is a Nash equilibrium.

01:20:00.239 --> 01:20:03.017
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] Nash
equilibrium for that situation,

01:20:03.017 --> 01:20:04.410
[INAUDIBLE] strategy.

01:20:04.410 --> 01:20:04.710
PROFESSOR: That's right.

01:20:04.710 --> 01:20:06.293
So this is not the
definition of that.

01:20:06.293 --> 01:20:08.070
But this thing is
true, which means

01:20:08.070 --> 01:20:09.278
that it's a Nash equilibrium.

01:20:12.500 --> 01:20:18.690
And this other thing that's
interesting is that--

01:20:18.690 --> 01:20:21.690
so this tells us that it's
actually one of these ESS's.

01:20:21.690 --> 01:20:28.340
And if you have questions about
this, I'm happy to answer it.

01:20:28.340 --> 01:20:30.640
It's explained in
the book as well.

01:20:30.640 --> 01:20:32.700
We are out of time, so
I should let you go.

01:20:32.700 --> 01:20:35.645
But good luck on the
exam next Thursday.

01:20:35.645 --> 01:20:37.770
If you have questions and
you want to meet with me,

01:20:37.770 --> 01:20:38.811
I'm available on Tuesday.

01:20:38.811 --> 01:20:40.940
So please let me know.
