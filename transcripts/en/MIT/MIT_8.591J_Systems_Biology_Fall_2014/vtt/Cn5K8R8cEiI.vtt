00:00:20.975 --> 00:00:22.350
PROFESSOR: So
today, what we want

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.402
to do is we want to talk
about two related topics.

00:00:25.402 --> 00:00:26.860
The first is going
to this question

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.670
of the evolution of
virulence and how

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.830
to model host-parasite
interactions more broadly.

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.580
That's kind of modeled on
chapter 11 of Martin's book.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:38.040
We'll focus on the first half
of it for the discussions today.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.320
This is in the context of
when a given host can only

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.320
have one strain of the
parasite or virus or whatnot

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.890
inside that body.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.630
The model presented
in Martin's book

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:56.590
is very similar to classic
models in epidemiology, which

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.750
are the so-called
SIR type models,

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.130
where you divide up
the host population

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.200
into whether the they
are sensitive-- i.e.,

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.360
non-infected--
infected, or resistant.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.120
And then, we'll
draw the parallels

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.030
of how we get from the model
that you read about in Martin's

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.990
book to the classic SIR models.

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.450
But in both of these cases,
the fundamental parameter

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.690
that drives these things
is this R0 parameter.

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.989
It tells us about the
expected number of new cases

00:01:29.989 --> 00:01:32.280
that will result when you
introduce one infected member

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.664
into the population.

00:01:33.664 --> 00:01:37.460
AUDIENCE: Sorry, will you be
taking about super-infections?

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.280
PROFESSOR: Only a
little bit but, I

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.920
would say, depending on time.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.530
But if you're interested in
the super-infection discussion

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.156
more, we can talk about
it after class, maybe.

00:01:46.156 --> 00:01:46.655
All right.

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:51.150
And so, for the
second half of class,

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:52.733
what we're going to
do though is we're

00:01:52.733 --> 00:01:56.320
going to talk about the possible
evolutionary benefits of sex.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.700
And in particular, we'll talk
about this hypothesis, which

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.110
is one of the reigning
hypotheses for why it might

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.640
be that sex is as widespread as
it is, which is the Red Queen

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.970
hypothesis, from
Lewis Carroll's novel.

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.730
And we're going to discuss this
paper that you guys read about,

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.188
"Running with the
Red Queen," which

00:02:15.188 --> 00:02:18.290
I think has a nice
discussion of this debate

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.130
and, then, some nice
experiments looking

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.880
at experimental coevolution
between the C. elegans worm

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.420
and it's infecting parasite,
which is a serratia bacterium.

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.880
Any questions
before we get going?

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.390
OK, what I want to do
is start by discussing

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.630
this model in Martin's book.

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.860
But also, there's a little bit
of this philosophical question.

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.600
Any time, that you are
modeling, you always

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.869
had to make decisions
about which of the details

00:02:55.869 --> 00:02:57.910
you want to try to model
and which of the details

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.290
you do not want to model.

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.750
And depending upon
the situation,

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.890
it may be that some
assumptions are more or less

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:05.510
appropriate than others.

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:11.920
Now, in the model that
Martin wrote down-- well,

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.150
we'll try to figure out what
the assumptions are here.

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.140
So we have what
you might think of

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.840
as some sensitive individuals.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.240
Plus, the infected
individuals are going

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.590
to interact at some rate, beta.

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.230
So this is how the
sensitive become infected.

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.300
And it results in, now,
two infected individuals.

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:37.920
Now of course, each
of these individuals

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.810
will, say, have some
lifespan or die at some rate.

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:47.200
All right, so the sensitive
or uninfected individuals

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.840
die at rate u.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.290
Whereas, infected individuals,
others-- an increase

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.658
in the death-rate, described
by some virulence, v. OK?

00:04:01.817 --> 00:04:03.230
OK.

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.136
Now, the model as
written-- what's

00:04:05.136 --> 00:04:06.760
going to be the fate
of the population?

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.774
AUDIENCE: Everyone all dies.

00:04:13.774 --> 00:04:14.730
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.579
Everyone's going to die, right?

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:18.279
And that's even true
in the-- it's not

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:22.910
even that the population's dying
as a result of the infection.

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.216
Because even in the absence
of any infected individuals,

00:04:26.216 --> 00:04:27.340
you just have people dying.

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.270
So you need to have some way of
keeping the population going,

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.080
so you can study it perhaps.

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.830
What we're going to assume is
that sensitive individuals,

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.770
or uninfected individuals,
will enter the population just

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:40.650
at some rate, k.

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:50.120
Now, in terms of the
philosophical question,

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.680
in the beginning of
the chapter, Martin

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.820
talks a bit about this
question of microparasites

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.460
versus macroparasites.

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.425
And I can somebody remind
us, what's the distinction?

00:05:02.425 --> 00:05:06.695
and For what kind of
parasite might this

00:05:06.695 --> 00:05:07.790
be intended to model?

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:13.080
Yes?

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:20.460
AUDIENCE: Well, what I got
from it is that microparasites

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:27.348
are on the order of
single-cellular organisms,

00:05:27.348 --> 00:05:34.256
generally things that have much
shorter reproductive steps,

00:05:34.256 --> 00:05:35.679
I guess.

00:05:35.679 --> 00:05:37.220
They reproduce a
lot more frequently.

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:38.768
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:05:38.768 --> 00:05:40.184
AUDIENCE: Whereas,
macro-parasites

00:05:40.184 --> 00:05:43.642
are like the [INAUDIBLE] or
the tapeworm or something,

00:05:43.642 --> 00:05:48.088
which would not
necessarily reproduce

00:05:48.088 --> 00:05:49.570
a lot inside the host.

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:50.710
PROFESSOR: Mm-hm.

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:51.210
Right.

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:53.690
And I would say, that just
given this distinction

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:56.420
between the microparasites, that
might be viruses and bacteria,

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:57.836
as compared to the
macroparasites,

00:05:57.836 --> 00:06:00.720
that are things like
tapeworms and so forth, it's

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.950
not obvious from that
that you would have two

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:05.520
different modeling frameworks.

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:11.050
But what is the argument that
is made in Martin's book?

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:13.030
Or can you think up
an argument for why

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:15.270
it is that it might be this
kind of model you would

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:16.561
want to use for microparasites?

00:06:19.145 --> 00:06:19.726
Yes.

00:06:19.726 --> 00:06:21.101
AUDIENCE: Because
we don't really

00:06:21.101 --> 00:06:22.568
care about-- he
mentioned something

00:06:22.568 --> 00:06:24.035
that the microparasites
reproduce

00:06:24.035 --> 00:06:26.480
in large numbers in
infected individuals.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.169
So we don't have to keep
track of the internal state

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:31.380
of someone that's infected.

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:32.510
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:35.440
And some of it's, maybe,
even a historical thing.

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:40.590
There might be huge numbers of
viruses-- a flu virus or so--

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:42.440
in an infected individual.

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.430
And in some ways,
maybe, the number

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:48.409
of viruses that is in that host
is not the most relevant thing.

00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:49.950
And it's certainly
would be much more

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:51.730
complicated to try to
keep track of that.

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:57.635
And so, if you can get
meaningful predictions-- rather

00:06:57.635 --> 00:07:00.260
than keeping track of the number
of viruses, say, in each host,

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.570
instead you just put the
host into different classes--

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:06.199
sensitive and
infected, for example.

00:07:06.199 --> 00:07:07.990
Later, we'll talk about
what happens if you

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:10.150
have a resistant type of class.

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:13.730
But the idea there is that
there's, maybe, even also

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:15.550
some separation of time scales.

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:16.830
Because you get infected.

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:22.376
And kind of quickly, you're
just sick and may be infective.

00:07:22.376 --> 00:07:23.750
But at some rate,
you get better.

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:26.120
And it's not that
you'll necessarily

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.890
gain very much by keeping
track of the precise number

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:30.450
of viruses in the host.

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:33.050
Of course, this is ultimately
an experimental observational

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:34.840
question of whether
this sort of model

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:36.552
provides you inside
that you're going

00:07:36.552 --> 00:07:38.510
to need to make sense of
these diseases, right?

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:40.995
AUDIENCE: And then it also
seems like your method

00:07:40.995 --> 00:07:43.977
of transmission
of macroparasites

00:07:43.977 --> 00:07:45.480
can be very different.

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:46.480
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:48.510
So the mechanism of
transmission depends

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:52.310
very much on the disease
that you're studying.

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:55.200
And the macroparasites,
in many cases,

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:58.260
they're transmitted not
from direct interactions

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:02.450
between the hosts, but through
the environment or something

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:02.950
else.

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:09.140
It's also, perhaps,
just worth pointing out

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:14.260
that parasites are just a
ubiquitous aspect of life.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:19.290
So you can name an organism,
and you can pretty much

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:21.560
be guaranteed that there's
going to be some notion

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:23.650
of a parasite on that organism.

00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:26.860
And there can be
multiple layers of this.

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:30.590
So we certainly
have many parasites.

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:34.630
We're infected by many viruses
and bacteria and other things.

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:37.830
But bacteria-- we think of
them as being very small--

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:42.289
they're also preyed upon
by these phage, which

00:08:42.289 --> 00:08:46.842
is a parasite that targets
specifically bacteria.

00:08:46.842 --> 00:08:48.800
So it's not just that
it's an incidental thing.

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:52.570
But these are really viruses
that have evolved specifically

00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:55.920
to divide in bacteria.

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:58.560
And we didn't really talk
about this very much.

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:02.890
But one of the classic models
for cooperation and cheating

00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:05.690
is based on what you
could think about as

00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:10.120
some sort of parasitic
sub-population within phage.

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:12.110
So this is a classic
paper by Lin Chow where

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:14.480
he showed that if you
evolved phage and bacteria

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:18.290
in a condition where many phage
infect a given bacteria, then,

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:22.394
you can evolve what you
could think of as cheater

00:09:22.394 --> 00:09:23.560
strategies or cheater phage.

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:26.270
Because these are
phage that maybe

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:28.680
can't reproduce on their
own, but have shorter genomes

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:32.350
and can out-replicate
the normal phage.

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:35.550
So if both of these end up
in a single bacterial cell,

00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:38.560
then these cheater
phage can spread

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:40.810
by taking advantage of, say,
the replication machinery

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:42.060
from the rest of the phage.

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:44.740
So in some ways, you might
call that some sort of DNA

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:46.172
parasite or so.

00:09:46.172 --> 00:09:48.630
So there's really parasites in
many, many different levels.

00:09:53.965 --> 00:09:55.280
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:55.905
PROFESSOR: Yes?

00:09:55.905 --> 00:09:58.330
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
ultimately think about is, k,

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:01.260
is this really the number--

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.050
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
you know, I would

00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:08.470
say that the k is, in some ways,
not a very satisfying feature

00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:09.120
of this model.

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:12.670
Because it makes it feel that
the model is very special,

00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:13.170
right?

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:15.265
AUDIENCE: But I mean,
in a natural population

00:10:15.265 --> 00:10:19.740
and rate at which people are
born, is that the same change?

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:21.460
Or--

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:23.060
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:25.320
That was the example
I was going to give.

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:31.170
It's not clear-- of course,
it requires somebody

00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:33.370
to give birth to kids, right?

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:36.705
So in that sense, modeling this
as a constant number per unit

00:10:36.705 --> 00:10:39.660
of time-- which is what
we're doing-- this rate k,

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:40.730
is a little bit funny.

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:42.480
Because then, what
you'd really want to do

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.970
is say, oh, maybe
it's these guys that

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:47.130
give birth at some rate
or so, if you really

00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:48.420
wanted to be accurate.

00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:50.470
So I'd say that this
is, in some ways, just

00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:53.142
a mathematical simplification
so that we can get

00:10:53.142 --> 00:10:54.350
at the heart of the dynamics.

00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:57.020
And what we'll see is
that, in these SIR models,

00:10:57.020 --> 00:11:00.180
you don't invoke
anything like this.

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:03.510
But rather, what you do is
you assume that, at some rate,

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:07.430
infected individuals
don't just die.

00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:09.500
But they become resistant.

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:12.560
And then, maybe later, they
become sensitive again.

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:14.956
So you need some way of
being sure that it's not

00:11:14.956 --> 00:11:19.080
the case that everybody
just always dies.

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:21.700
So in some ways, this is more
mathematical convenience.

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:23.589
And the basic
conclusions end up being

00:11:23.589 --> 00:11:25.130
very robust to these
sorts of things.

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:34.250
All right, so in
these models, it's

00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:37.180
always good to be
clear about how

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:40.280
we go from this framework
to something that is more

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:42.870
of a differential equation.

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:44.500
And what we can
do is we can think

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:49.920
about these uninfected
individuals, i.e.

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:51.605
the S-es as compared
to the infected.

00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:57.335
And we're going to
have these guys be x.

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:05.040
And this S and I.

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:08.670
So the way that the
x will be changing

00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:11.135
is that we're assuming
that there's always

00:12:11.135 --> 00:12:12.510
some influx of
individuals, which

00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:15.035
could be birth or migration
or something else,

00:12:15.035 --> 00:12:17.537
that are just always entering.

00:12:17.537 --> 00:12:19.120
But then, there's
going to be two ways

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:21.670
that x is going to decrease.

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:25.780
One is that there's just a
death rate that is resulting

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:27.627
in the absence of infection.

00:12:27.627 --> 00:12:29.085
But then, also,
there's going to be

00:12:29.085 --> 00:12:30.110
some rate of infection,
which is going

00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:31.470
to be proportional to beta.

00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:33.960
So this is the
simplest way that you

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:37.890
can imagine capturing
this element

00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:42.870
that the infected individuals
can transmit the infection

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:45.090
to the sensitive individuals.

00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:50.290
So we're modeling them as
a well-mixed population,

00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:51.780
just like in chemical reactions.

00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:54.500
And somehow, the
rate of infection

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:58.080
is proportional to the frequency
that they hit each other.

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:02.810
Certainly, the simplest kind
of model you can imagine.

00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:06.250
Whereas, the infected
individuals-- well,

00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:09.530
we're going to have an
increased rate of death.

00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:12.180
So this is a simplified
way to write it.

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:20.230
So this is really that there's
a minus, u plus v times y.

00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:23.130
So this is just the death rate.

00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:27.530
But then, any individual that
leaves the sensitive class--

00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:31.460
this minus beta xy--
enters the infected class.

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:37.860
This makes a lot
of sense, I think.

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:42.310
Now, the question is, can we
make sense of what's going on?

00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:49.215
Now, you saw in your reading
what this R0 parameter was.

00:13:49.215 --> 00:13:50.960
And you should always
remember that it's

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:54.970
defined as this thing
of, if you introduce

00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:57.460
one infected individual
into a population

00:13:57.460 --> 00:13:59.540
of sensitive
individuals, what is

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:03.430
the mean number of new
infections that you get?

00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:07.730
And it makes sense that the
key thing is whether that R0

00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:09.026
is greater or less than 1.

00:14:09.026 --> 00:14:10.400
Because if it's
greater than one,

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:13.204
that leads to this
exponential explosion

00:14:13.204 --> 00:14:14.370
of the infected individuals.

00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:17.500
It doesn't mean that everyone's
going to die, necessarily.

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:18.580
We'll get into that.

00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:20.760
But if R0 is less
than 1, then you

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:23.710
expect that
infection to die out.

00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:27.380
So why is it that if
R0 is greater than 1,

00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:29.130
and you introduce one
infected individual,

00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:33.149
it doesn't necessarily
lead to a wipe-out

00:14:33.149 --> 00:14:34.190
of the entire population?

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:44.822
Or maybe it does.

00:14:44.822 --> 00:14:46.030
This model is a little funny.

00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:47.988
Because you always have
an individual entering.

00:14:51.581 --> 00:14:52.080
But--

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:54.415
AUDIENCE: If the [INAUDIBLE]
is really virulent,

00:14:54.415 --> 00:14:56.872
then only infected
individuals die before--

00:14:56.872 --> 00:14:57.580
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:14:57.580 --> 00:14:59.984
So if it's very virulent,
then the infected individuals

00:14:59.984 --> 00:15:00.650
may die quickly.

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:01.930
And this gets into
this question of there

00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:03.804
may be some trade-offs
in terms of virulence.

00:15:03.804 --> 00:15:07.190
And we'll talk more about, then,
the evolution of virulence.

00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:12.820
But there's a wide variety
of classes of models,

00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:16.020
not just the ones where
you have k entering.

00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:20.461
But the question somehow
is-- just because R0

00:15:20.461 --> 00:15:21.960
is greater than 1,
that doesn't mean

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:25.667
that the entire population will
necessarily become infected.

00:15:25.667 --> 00:15:27.750
Because we have this idea
of an exponential growth

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:32.740
of the infected population
if R0 is greater than 1.

00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:35.330
So why is it that
it's not necessarily

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:40.780
going to happen that the
entire population is-- well,

00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:43.411
this question's a little
bit ill-posed in this model.

00:15:43.411 --> 00:15:47.259
AUDIENCE: Is it because the
number of sensitive individuals

00:15:47.259 --> 00:15:49.320
becomes very low
at some point and--

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:50.320
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:52.010
And I think this is
the basic intuition.

00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:56.440
As more and more members of
the population become infected,

00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:58.610
then that could, in
principle, reduce

00:15:58.610 --> 00:16:04.760
to the possibilities for new
individuals to be susceptible.

00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:15.310
And I'm using susceptible and
sensitive interchangeably.

00:16:15.310 --> 00:16:18.990
And so eventually,
this exponential growth

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:20.951
of the population can
be limited in some way.

00:16:20.951 --> 00:16:22.700
We'll maybe look at
this a little bit more

00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:23.960
in this SIR model.

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:25.636
Because it's more clear.

00:16:25.636 --> 00:16:29.890
AUDIENCE: So we
basically collect a rate.

00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:31.404
R0 is a rate, right?

00:16:34.258 --> 00:16:34.758
[INAUDIBLE]

00:16:34.758 --> 00:16:36.240
PROFESSOR: No.

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:38.440
It's a number.

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:40.894
It's the expected
number of new infections

00:16:40.894 --> 00:16:43.185
that you get when you introduce
one infected individual

00:16:43.185 --> 00:16:45.681
into the population.

00:16:45.681 --> 00:16:46.180
And we're--

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:47.801
AUDIENCE: It's like, period.

00:16:47.801 --> 00:16:51.730
So there's not, like,
per-unit time or--

00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:55.030
PROFESSOR: It's
a number, period.

00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:57.940
AUDIENCE: OK, so if
you have R equal to 1,

00:16:57.940 --> 00:16:59.386
you expect that
when you introduce

00:16:59.386 --> 00:17:01.073
an infected individual
into a population

00:17:01.073 --> 00:17:04.051
of sensitive individuals, you
will get one other infected

00:17:04.051 --> 00:17:04.550
individual.

00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:04.710
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:07.240
So that's kind of the
neutrally-stable situation.

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:09.516
If R0 is 1, then you add
one infected individual

00:17:09.516 --> 00:17:12.099
and you expect to get one other
one, so you have a random walk

00:17:12.099 --> 00:17:14.970
and-- well, in general,
it will randomly

00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:16.221
go extinct, eventually.

00:17:16.221 --> 00:17:16.720
Yes?

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:19.672
AUDIENCE: What is the
lifetime of the infected--

00:17:19.672 --> 00:17:21.530
PROFESSOR: So it depends.

00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:23.560
And so, that's what we're
going to do right now

00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:27.339
is see if we can reconstruct
what this R0 is equal to

00:17:27.339 --> 00:17:28.860
in this model.

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:30.720
AUDIENCE: Another
quick question--

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:34.060
what's the distribution
of the-- so--

00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:34.690
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:35.340
AUDIENCE: --a
deterministic role--

00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:36.360
PROFESSOR: Yes, exactly.

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:38.317
So this is very interesting.

00:17:38.317 --> 00:17:40.400
The question is, what is
going to the distribution

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:44.160
of the number of
infected individuals?

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:45.920
And in this model,
we're assuming

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:49.690
that every infected
individuals is the same.

00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:51.590
So we should be able
to-- I wish that we

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:54.580
just, on the wall somewhere,
had our five different standard

00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:56.860
probability distributions,
so that we could always

00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:58.980
go back to them.

00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:01.180
So the question
is, in this model,

00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:04.486
if you introduce one infected
individual in the population,

00:18:04.486 --> 00:18:06.360
how many new infected
individuals do you get?

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:08.800
R0 tells you about the mean.

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:11.270
But will you always
get the mean?

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:13.270
No.

00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:15.160
So let's all think about
this for 10 seconds.

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:17.500
And we will verbally
yell out what

00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:19.250
we think the
distribution will be

00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:21.610
of the number of new infections
from a single infected

00:18:21.610 --> 00:18:22.110
individual.

00:18:24.755 --> 00:18:25.255
OK?

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:32.870
Verbally, ready!

00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:34.146
Five, (WHISPERING) four--

00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:37.480
AUDIENCE: Poisson.

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:39.722
AUDIENCE: Piosson.

00:18:39.722 --> 00:18:41.384
AUDIENCE: Exponential

00:18:41.384 --> 00:18:43.550
PROFESSOR: All right,
everybody thinks it's Poisson.

00:18:43.550 --> 00:18:44.549
Why would it be Poisson?

00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:50.539
AUDIENCE: Because
you have a rate--

00:18:50.539 --> 00:18:51.622
AUDIENCE: It's not a rate.

00:18:51.622 --> 00:18:53.598
AUDIENCE: It's not?

00:18:53.598 --> 00:18:55.862
AUDIENCE: The initial
population is much larger--

00:18:55.862 --> 00:18:56.570
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:58.510
OK, so the idea
is that we imagine

00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:00.490
we're some infected individual.

00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:04.770
And there's some rate that
we are infecting others.

00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:09.110
Now, if I ask you the question,
how many individuals will I

00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:13.990
infect in the next 10 days?

00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:17.030
Or we could do 21 days
if you guys like that.

00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:19.760
So all right, if I
ask, how many do I

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:23.010
infect in the next 10 days?

00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:24.680
Now, I'm assuming
that I stay alive.

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:26.349
But let's say,
assuming I stay alive,

00:19:26.349 --> 00:19:28.140
how many do I infect
over the next 10 days?

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:33.750
That's going to be distributed
as-- that is Poisson.

00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:36.280
But the question you're
asking is a different one.

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:39.440
You're asking,
what is going to be

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:41.690
the distribution of the total
number of new infections

00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:43.710
that I cause?

00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:48.130
And this is precisely
the same situation

00:19:48.130 --> 00:19:50.930
that we've analyzed
lots and lots of times.

00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:52.155
What does it look like?

00:19:52.155 --> 00:19:53.580
AUDIENCE: Geometric
distribution.

00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:54.205
PROFESSOR: Hmm?

00:19:54.205 --> 00:19:55.480
AUDIENCE: Geometric.

00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:56.750
PROFESSOR: OK, yes.

00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:57.910
It's going to be a
geometric distribution.

00:19:57.910 --> 00:19:58.470
But why?

00:19:58.470 --> 00:20:01.890
AUDIENCE: Well, because you
can have an infection and then

00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:02.640
another infection.

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:04.050
And so then, it's,
like, multiples of ten.

00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:05.050
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:08.530
So we have an
infected individual.

00:20:08.530 --> 00:20:10.120
There's two things
that can happen.

00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:14.600
He's going to die at some rate.

00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:21.560
And there's this
other rate, which

00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:25.367
is going to go as
beta times x or so,

00:20:25.367 --> 00:20:27.200
telling us about the
rate of new infections.

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:28.908
And we want to know,
how many times do we

00:20:28.908 --> 00:20:34.310
go around this loop before we
degrade, or die, or something,

00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:35.849
disappear from the population?

00:20:35.849 --> 00:20:37.140
Does this look at all familiar?

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:38.170
AUDIENCE: Mm-hmm.

00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:38.460
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:40.145
Were you guys the
same students that

00:20:40.145 --> 00:20:41.345
were here for the first
half of the class?

00:20:41.345 --> 00:20:42.240
AUDIENCE: Ha.

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:43.038
PROFESSOR: Yeah?

00:20:43.038 --> 00:20:43.538
No.

00:20:43.538 --> 00:20:47.031
AUDIENCE: And so, R0 is
like the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:20:47.031 --> 00:20:52.021
It's like the number of--

00:20:52.021 --> 00:20:54.017
AUDIENCE: It's the
mean number for bursts.

00:20:54.017 --> 00:20:56.530
AUDIENCE: You haven't
evaluated when the population--

00:20:56.530 --> 00:21:00.342
PROFESSOR: So R0 is the
mean size of protein bursts,

00:21:00.342 --> 00:21:02.050
in the context of this
other model, which

00:21:02.050 --> 00:21:03.258
was-- what was the situation?

00:21:05.471 --> 00:21:07.720
And this one's a really good
one for you guys to know.

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:08.719
It's going to be useful.

00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:17.970
So we saw this exact model in
the context of gene expression.

00:21:17.970 --> 00:21:20.381
And what was the
situation that we--

00:21:20.381 --> 00:21:21.880
AUDIENCE: Production
of [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:22.877
PROFESSOR: Production of--

00:21:22.877 --> 00:21:24.160
AUDIENCE: --proteins
from a single mRNA.

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:26.610
PROFESSOR: Yeah, the production
of proteins from a single mRNA.

00:21:26.610 --> 00:21:26.840
Right?

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:29.130
Because remember, we had this
thing where we had the mRNA.

00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:30.850
And we said, oh, well
the mRNA is going

00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:32.450
to be degraded at some rate.

00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:35.732
But also, it's going to be
translated at some rate.

00:21:35.732 --> 00:21:37.190
So the distribution
number of times

00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:39.149
that it's translated
before it degrades

00:21:39.149 --> 00:21:40.190
is going to be geometric.

00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:42.500
Because we go around this
loop some number of times.

00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:46.050
All right, so this
is the same thing.

00:21:46.050 --> 00:21:52.150
And the paper that I put
as supplementary reading,

00:21:52.150 --> 00:21:54.870
by Jamie Lloyd-Smith?

00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:57.200
I always get his name and
Jamie Lloyd Wright-- right?

00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:58.075
Something-- mixed up.

00:21:58.075 --> 00:21:59.241
But yeah, Jamie Lloyd-Smith.

00:21:59.241 --> 00:21:59.770
Smith.

00:21:59.770 --> 00:22:05.050
So he was studying the
dynamics of infections

00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:07.110
when you have this
thing where there's

00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:11.100
intrinsic variation in, say, the
infectivity of an individual.

00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:13.380
Because here, you get this
geometric distribution,

00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:17.010
even though all the individuals
are, in principal, identical.

00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:20.140
Now, the question is, if there's
some distributions of, say,

00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:23.650
infectivities, then
you'll get an even broader

00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:26.585
distribution of resulting
number of new infections.

00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:31.670
So there's this classic
thing of Typhoid Mary.

00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:38.346
She's was a nurse-- OK, now
I don't remember the story.

00:22:38.346 --> 00:22:38.846
Yeah?

00:22:38.846 --> 00:22:39.840
AUDIENCE: She was a cook.

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:40.589
PROFESSOR: A cook.

00:22:40.589 --> 00:22:41.400
Oh, a cook, nurse--

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:43.733
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] so she
cooked for a lot of people.

00:22:43.733 --> 00:22:46.120
PROFESSOR: OK, so she was
somehow resistant to typhoid.

00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:48.852
But then, she was cooking for
other people and, so then,

00:22:48.852 --> 00:22:50.060
caused a bunch of infections.

00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:50.560
Is that--?

00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:51.366
OK.

00:22:51.366 --> 00:22:52.740
Yeah, so this
would be an example

00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:54.810
of a very infective
individual that's

00:22:54.810 --> 00:22:58.590
beyond the assumptions
in this model.

00:22:58.590 --> 00:23:00.800
And as you can imagine,
if you have variations

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:04.490
in this infectivity, then
what it does, for a given R0--

00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:07.080
so if you fix R0, then you
have a broader distribution

00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:07.720
of infectivity.

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:11.270
What it means is that a larger
fraction of the infections

00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:12.310
will go extinct.

00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:16.826
But those that get
going will be explosive.

00:23:16.826 --> 00:23:18.700
If you're curious about
these sorts of ideas,

00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:21.380
you should look at this
optional reading paper

00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:24.697
that I put out there.

00:23:24.697 --> 00:23:26.280
All right, so I just
want to be clear.

00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:33.221
This is geometric number of
new infections, distribution

00:23:33.221 --> 00:23:33.970
of new infections.

00:23:39.550 --> 00:23:40.050
Yes?

00:23:40.050 --> 00:23:43.410
AUDIENCE: So is
this just one cycle?

00:23:43.410 --> 00:23:45.350
Like, one--

00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:49.320
PROFESSOR: So we're talking
about the number of infections

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:51.915
that result when you just
add one infected individual

00:23:51.915 --> 00:23:52.685
to the population.

00:23:52.685 --> 00:23:55.222
AUDIENCE: OK, so then, you
don't think about, afterwards,

00:23:55.222 --> 00:23:56.972
what happens to those
infected individuals

00:23:56.972 --> 00:23:58.064
and if they infect--

00:23:58.064 --> 00:24:00.230
PROFESSOR: Well, we are not
yet thinking about them.

00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:03.460
Although, in this case,
those are also geometrically

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:04.260
distributed.

00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:06.690
But what you expect is that
the mean of those things

00:24:06.690 --> 00:24:07.620
will change.

00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:10.970
Because the number of
susceptible or whatnot

00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:14.300
individuals-- that's
going to change.

00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:17.200
So the mean number
is going to change.

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:19.381
But the distributions
will still be geometric.

00:24:19.381 --> 00:24:21.786
AUDIENCE: But in total, that
won't be geometric anymore.

00:24:21.786 --> 00:24:23.619
Because if we're looking
at the total number

00:24:23.619 --> 00:24:27.077
of infected individuals after
learning about the geometric--

00:24:27.077 --> 00:24:27.660
PROFESSOR: No.

00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:31.100
So just because each of
these sub-steps is geometric

00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:34.910
does not mean that you end up
with a geometric distribution.

00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:40.977
Indeed, let's say that i put
in 20 infected individuals

00:24:40.977 --> 00:24:41.810
into the population.

00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:43.990
And I ask, what's going
to be the distribution

00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:46.750
of the number of infections
caused immediately

00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:47.770
from those 20?

00:24:47.770 --> 00:24:49.030
That's going to be what?

00:24:49.030 --> 00:24:51.010
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:24:51.010 --> 00:24:54.020
Yeah, and for 20, it's going
to be basically Gaussian.

00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:58.414
OK, well if I said 100,
well definitely Gaussian.

00:24:58.414 --> 00:25:00.330
It's a gamma distribution
that looks very much

00:25:00.330 --> 00:25:04.062
look a Gaussian, in that case.

00:25:04.062 --> 00:25:05.837
All right?

00:25:05.837 --> 00:25:09.240
All right.

00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:11.610
So we've been talking about
the definition of this R0.

00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:15.495
But of course, we should
figure out what it is.

00:25:15.495 --> 00:25:18.900
We want R0 is
equal to-- and what

00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:26.262
I'm going to tell you is that
there's a 1 over u plus v.

00:25:26.262 --> 00:25:27.720
But then, there's
some other terms.

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:30.330
And I've unfortunately
lost my notes.

00:25:30.330 --> 00:25:33.479
So you guys are going to have
to help me figure this out.

00:25:33.479 --> 00:25:35.020
And what you're
going to do is you're

00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:36.603
going to take advantage
of your cards.

00:25:36.603 --> 00:25:38.390
And again, put things
in the numerators

00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:39.884
and the denominators,
corresponding

00:25:39.884 --> 00:25:41.800
to how I'm supposed to
fill out this equation.

00:25:44.039 --> 00:25:46.580
You can start thinking about it
while I give you the options.

00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:02.820
OK.

00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:05.809
So I guess you could
recapitulate this

00:26:05.809 --> 00:26:07.600
by just putting B and
C, although maybe you

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:09.772
need it more than once.

00:26:09.772 --> 00:26:10.480
Do what you will.

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:13.404
Do you understand the question?

00:26:13.404 --> 00:26:14.820
There's going to
be something else

00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:15.790
I'm going to put right here.

00:26:15.790 --> 00:26:16.756
And I want to know--
there are going

00:26:16.756 --> 00:26:18.290
to be somethings in the
numerator, somethings

00:26:18.290 --> 00:26:19.081
in the denominator.

00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:24.380
I'm going to give you 30
seconds to think about it.

00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:26.714
Because it's important
to be able to reason

00:26:26.714 --> 00:26:27.630
your way through this.

00:27:13.786 --> 00:27:16.136
All right, do need more time?

00:27:16.136 --> 00:27:18.080
Yep, OK.

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:19.680
I'll give you
another 15 seconds.

00:27:46.021 --> 00:27:48.420
All right, let's
go ahead and vote.

00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:49.370
Ready?

00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:54.040
Three, two, one.

00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:55.320
All right.

00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:55.820
I like it!

00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:58.064
We're really looking quite nice.

00:27:58.064 --> 00:27:59.480
So there's a claim
that it's going

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:08.336
to be AD over B. We should
be writing a beta k over u.

00:28:08.336 --> 00:28:10.770
All right.

00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:12.880
Can somebody explain
how they got there?

00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:22.957
Yes, please.

00:28:22.957 --> 00:28:29.747
AUDIENCE: Well, it's
going to be-- these two--

00:28:29.747 --> 00:28:30.580
PROFESSOR: OK, yeah.

00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:31.640
This helped, right?

00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:34.390
OK, good, perfect.

00:28:34.390 --> 00:28:38.392
So this thing is what?

00:28:38.392 --> 00:28:41.242
What is this term here?

00:28:41.242 --> 00:28:43.034
AUDIENCE: That's the death rate.

00:28:43.034 --> 00:28:43.830
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:48.095
Which means that the one over
it is the expected lifetime

00:28:48.095 --> 00:28:49.970
of an infected individual.

00:28:49.970 --> 00:28:53.360
So the definition of R0 is,
you put an infected individual

00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:57.027
into a population
of susceptibles.

00:28:57.027 --> 00:28:58.610
Now, we want to know,
OK, well there's

00:28:58.610 --> 00:29:01.860
a expected lifetime of this
infected individual, which

00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:02.915
is given by this.

00:29:02.915 --> 00:29:04.540
And then, we have to
think about, well,

00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:07.081
what's the rate that we're going
to be infecting individuals?

00:29:07.081 --> 00:29:10.850
And that's going
to be beta times x.

00:29:10.850 --> 00:29:15.590
But what we want to know is, is
x before we add any infection?

00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:19.251
And without any infection, then
we just have a rate of entry

00:29:19.251 --> 00:29:20.250
and, then, a death rate.

00:29:20.250 --> 00:29:22.067
So it's just k over u.

00:29:22.067 --> 00:29:22.567
OK?

00:29:25.850 --> 00:29:28.960
Now, the key thing in all of
these epidemiological models

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:33.190
is whether this R0 is
greater or less than 1.

00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:36.340
And that's going to tell us
whether the disease becomes

00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:40.920
endemic or not, whether,
at steady state,

00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:46.140
we have a population of
infected individuals.

00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:52.060
So R0, greater than one, means
it's in an endemic population.

00:30:05.530 --> 00:30:09.884
Now, in this model,
we can then ask--

00:30:09.884 --> 00:30:12.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:13.551 --> 00:30:16.036
AUDIENCE: That really
is really funny.

00:30:16.036 --> 00:30:17.530
AUDIENCE: That is the hard part.

00:30:17.530 --> 00:30:18.405
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:30:18.405 --> 00:30:22.300
So do you like A, donuts,
B, cupcakes, or C, carrots?

00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:24.074
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:30:24.074 --> 00:30:24.990
Yeah, it's quite nice.

00:30:24.990 --> 00:30:28.130
Does anybody have any
notion of why somebody might

00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:30.570
have-- so Sam likes cupcakes.

00:30:30.570 --> 00:30:32.000
That's good to know.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.130
Yeah, they're so pretty that I
actually feel bad erasing it.

00:30:36.130 --> 00:30:37.661
OK, well, we'll
leave it up there --

00:30:37.661 --> 00:30:38.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:41.090
--for a little bit longer.

00:30:41.090 --> 00:30:43.240
Everybody can just
smile, because they know

00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:45.348
that the drawing is back there.

00:30:45.348 --> 00:30:46.782
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:49.530
All right.

00:30:49.530 --> 00:30:54.880
So in this model,
the fact that R0

00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:56.520
is this parameter
that tells us about

00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:58.894
whether there's going to be
an epidemic and then, indeed,

00:30:58.894 --> 00:31:01.640
whether later the
disease will be endemic,

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:04.240
does that already
tell us that R0 is

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:05.785
what's maximized by selection?

00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:10.231
No.

00:31:10.231 --> 00:31:10.730
Right?

00:31:10.730 --> 00:31:14.020
What was the key thing that
Martin does in the chapter

00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:16.260
in order to try to understand
something about what

00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:17.520
strain is selected for?

00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:37.140
Yes?

00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:42.475
AUDIENCE: Are you thinking of
when he introduces [INAUDIBLE]?

00:31:42.475 --> 00:31:45.020
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:31:45.020 --> 00:31:48.160
Yes, although, the part of the
chapter your thinking about is,

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:49.582
I think, the second half.

00:31:49.582 --> 00:31:51.040
It's talking about
super-infection,

00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:53.331
where there's all these
different types, and craziness,

00:31:53.331 --> 00:31:54.110
and so forth.

00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:56.800
But the initial
insight about what

00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:58.580
is going to be
selected for comes

00:31:58.580 --> 00:32:00.688
from a simpler model than that.

00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:07.340
So you don't have to think
about all those many parasites

00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:09.910
and those triangles
and all the craziness.

00:32:09.910 --> 00:32:12.228
Instead, there was a
simpler model that-- yeah?

00:32:12.228 --> 00:32:14.618
AUDIENCE: If you have
multiple parasites,

00:32:14.618 --> 00:32:18.560
then study states only
that one parasite exists.

00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:19.560
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:22.240
And so, what he does
is he just writes down

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:28.180
this model of where he now
allows two different parasites

00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:29.860
to be spreading the population.

00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:32.380
And at the beginning--
well, we'll write it down.

00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:33.890
And we want to be clear.

00:32:33.890 --> 00:32:36.080
There's a very important
assumption that he makes.

00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:42.400
What he's going to find is
that selection maximizes R0,

00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:43.988
the basic reproductive ratio.

00:32:47.749 --> 00:32:49.165
And it's going to
be in this model

00:32:49.165 --> 00:32:50.560
that I'm writing down now.

00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:52.530
So there's this x dot.

00:32:52.530 --> 00:32:53.950
And things look very similar.

00:33:17.806 --> 00:33:18.350
All right.

00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:20.349
Now, the question is,
what is the key assumption

00:33:20.349 --> 00:33:22.580
that we're making in writing
down these equations?

00:33:36.606 --> 00:33:37.105
Thought?

00:33:40.869 --> 00:33:42.910
AUDIENCE: One cannot have
more than one type of--

00:33:42.910 --> 00:33:43.909
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:33:43.909 --> 00:33:47.710
A host cannot be infected by
more than one type of strain.

00:33:47.710 --> 00:33:49.830
So that's very, very important.

00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:52.514
So there's no
super-infection, as they say.

00:33:59.554 --> 00:34:00.970
And depending on
the disease, this

00:34:00.970 --> 00:34:04.170
could either be a better
or worse assumption.

00:34:04.170 --> 00:34:07.330
But then, what is it that
is defining these two

00:34:07.330 --> 00:34:08.150
strains then?

00:34:08.150 --> 00:34:09.483
In what ways are they different?

00:34:13.919 --> 00:34:15.889
AUDIENCE: In virulence.

00:34:15.889 --> 00:34:19.489
PROFESSOR: Their
virulence is different.

00:34:19.489 --> 00:34:21.430
And what is virulence again?

00:34:21.430 --> 00:34:23.514
AUDIENCE: How likely it
is that it could kill you.

00:34:23.514 --> 00:34:24.513
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:34:24.513 --> 00:34:26.159
It's the additional
mortality that

00:34:26.159 --> 00:34:29.717
is caused by being
affected by that strain.

00:34:29.717 --> 00:34:31.550
Is that the only way
that they're different?

00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:32.092
AUDIENCE: No.

00:34:32.092 --> 00:34:32.675
PROFESSOR: No.

00:34:32.675 --> 00:34:33.683
What else is different?

00:34:33.683 --> 00:34:34.116
AUDIENCE: The infectivity.

00:34:34.116 --> 00:34:35.600
PROFESSOR: The
infectivity, right.

00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:38.850
So the betas are also different.

00:34:38.850 --> 00:34:41.190
And it's imported to
note that in this model--

00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:42.750
it's a very simple
model-- but we're

00:34:42.750 --> 00:34:46.360
allowing the strains to be
different in these two ways.

00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:49.090
And I think that
it's very intuitive

00:34:49.090 --> 00:34:53.080
to just say that, oh, well,
you want to have a larger beta,

00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:55.000
all other things equal.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.650
Because you would
like to spread.

00:34:57.650 --> 00:35:00.480
But I'd say, maybe,
it's not as obvious what

00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:02.160
happens in terms of virulence.

00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:03.730
And then, of
course, if you think

00:35:03.730 --> 00:35:07.200
about these two parameters--
in any biological context

00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:08.510
they may be coupled.

00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:13.176
In which case, things
are more subtle.

00:35:13.176 --> 00:35:18.016
AUDIENCE: So how reasonable
is something of something

00:35:18.016 --> 00:35:20.440
of [INAUDIBLE] on the strain?

00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:22.972
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I think that
this depends on the disease.

00:35:22.972 --> 00:35:23.888
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:23.888 --> 00:35:27.372
Is it that you're trading
virulence and new response

00:35:27.372 --> 00:35:27.872
and--

00:35:27.872 --> 00:35:31.740
PROFESSOR: Right, so that's
somehow the argument.

00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:38.510
And I'd say that,
depending on whether you're

00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:42.380
thinking about the host at the
level of an organism or a cell,

00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:45.920
then this would correspond
to very different worlds.

00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:49.680
So certainly, in the
context of viral infections

00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:51.870
and individual cells, there
are various mechanisms

00:35:51.870 --> 00:35:55.020
where, if one strain gets
in, then other strains

00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:57.960
have trouble getting in.

00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:00.920
Or if they do get in,
they can't do anything.

00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:03.446
So I think, this really
depends on the biology

00:36:03.446 --> 00:36:05.821
of the situation, whether this
is a reasonable assumption

00:36:05.821 --> 00:36:06.321
or not.

00:36:20.242 --> 00:36:22.200
So I'm not going to go
through all of the math.

00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:26.150
Because it ends up being
a little bit involved.

00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:31.610
But the condition for the mutual
invasibility of the two strains

00:36:31.610 --> 00:36:33.300
is a little bit subtle.

00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:37.130
So I do want to talk
about that a little bit.

00:36:37.130 --> 00:36:39.930
And so, in general,
in this model

00:36:39.930 --> 00:36:53.900
there's some equilibrium,
x star and y star.

00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:57.677
And indeed, there will
generally be damped oscillations

00:36:57.677 --> 00:36:58.510
to this equilibrium.

00:37:03.470 --> 00:37:05.480
So this is in the model
where there's just

00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:09.460
a single strain that's
described by some beta

00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:12.740
and some v. Of
course, you can also

00:37:12.740 --> 00:37:18.640
think about the equilibria, E1
and E2, that would result when

00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:24.050
you have-- so E1 is what would
happen at the equilibrium

00:37:24.050 --> 00:37:30.550
when you have x star evaluated
for the particular parameters

00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:32.850
of strain one, i.e.

00:37:32.850 --> 00:37:36.810
evaluated for beta1 and for v1.

00:37:36.810 --> 00:37:39.120
x star-- and that's also y star.

00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:41.120
Whereas, you would have
a different equilibrium,

00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:46.030
E2-- so this is a x
star and a y star--

00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:49.110
evaluated at beta2 and v2.

00:37:49.110 --> 00:37:50.890
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

00:37:50.890 --> 00:37:52.390
So these are the
equilibria that you

00:37:52.390 --> 00:37:54.645
would have if this was
the only strain that

00:37:54.645 --> 00:37:57.350
was present in the population
or if this was the only strain

00:37:57.350 --> 00:37:59.620
in the population.

00:37:59.620 --> 00:38:01.880
Now, it's not obvious that
those-- the equilibria--

00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:04.010
are the result when
you have both strains

00:38:04.010 --> 00:38:05.670
present in the population.

00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:07.560
But that's what we want
to try to figure out.

00:38:10.510 --> 00:38:12.895
But certainly, if you
only added strain one

00:38:12.895 --> 00:38:15.520
and you didn't add strain 2, you
would come to equilibrium, E1.

00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:25.745
So the question is, if we
start out at equilibrium E1,

00:38:25.745 --> 00:38:27.370
how is it we can
determine what happens

00:38:27.370 --> 00:38:32.040
if we now add an
infected individual,

00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:34.510
but infected by strain two?

00:38:43.730 --> 00:38:46.895
So what we want to know
is-- strain 2 can invade.

00:38:52.799 --> 00:38:54.340
And really, what
we're thinking about

00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:58.190
is a situation-- these
are the equilibria if it's

00:38:58.190 --> 00:39:03.155
the case that R1 is greater
than 1 and R2 is greater than 1.

00:39:03.155 --> 00:39:05.100
Because in some ways,
it's clear what happens.

00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:09.430
If both of the R1 and R2 are
less than 1, then what happens?

00:39:12.995 --> 00:39:14.120
AUDIENCE: It would die out.

00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:15.160
PROFESSOR: They both die out.

00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:17.368
If one of them is greater
than 1, one is less than 1.

00:39:17.368 --> 00:39:20.660
Then, right, the
strain that's below 1

00:39:20.660 --> 00:39:23.230
goes-- so the only interesting
or the only the only

00:39:23.230 --> 00:39:25.460
non-obvious question,
somehow, is what happens

00:39:25.460 --> 00:39:28.800
if they're both larger than 1?

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:30.465
What that means is
that, for example,

00:39:30.465 --> 00:39:32.590
if you had a population of
susceptible individuals,

00:39:32.590 --> 00:39:36.030
and you had one
infected by strain one,

00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:38.040
one infected by
strain two, then,

00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:40.420
in the deterministic
differential equation limit,

00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:43.470
they would both spread.

00:39:43.470 --> 00:39:45.939
So they're both
exponentially growing.

00:39:45.939 --> 00:39:47.480
Does that already
tell us that you're

00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:51.380
going to have coexistence
of the two strains?

00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:52.116
No.

00:39:52.116 --> 00:39:54.240
It means that they're both
exponentially spreading.

00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:56.800
But who knows what's
going to happen later?

00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:59.250
And indeed, what you can show
is that only one of the two

00:39:59.250 --> 00:40:00.250
strains is going to win.

00:40:00.250 --> 00:40:03.280
And it's the strain with the
higher reproductive ration,

00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:05.810
the higher R0, or
in this case, here.

00:40:08.291 --> 00:40:10.457
So how is it that we can
determine if strain two can

00:40:10.457 --> 00:40:13.510
invade equilibrium one?

00:40:13.510 --> 00:40:15.795
It's if-and-only-if something.

00:40:15.795 --> 00:40:18.170
Does anybody remember what
this condition ended up being?

00:40:30.988 --> 00:40:34.470
AUDIENCE: y2 dot at
E1 has to be positive?

00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:39.010
PROFESSOR: All right, y2 dot
at E1 has to be positive.

00:40:39.010 --> 00:40:39.540
Yes.

00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:41.370
And this ends up being
equivalent, I think,

00:40:41.370 --> 00:40:43.190
to what he writes.

00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:44.390
So let's write.

00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:45.770
I'll write and tell you.

00:40:45.770 --> 00:40:49.540
So the way that he wrote
it, is that it's y2

00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:52.761
dot, with respect to y2.

00:40:52.761 --> 00:40:55.260
But I think that this is really
equivalent to what you said.

00:41:00.310 --> 00:41:02.850
Because you said, OK, y2 dot
has to be something, right?

00:41:02.850 --> 00:41:04.632
But then, y2 dot evaluated what?

00:41:04.632 --> 00:41:06.090
And you would say,
evaluated at E1.

00:41:06.090 --> 00:41:11.244
But then, at E1-- what is
y2 dot evaluated at E1?

00:41:11.244 --> 00:41:12.170
AUDIENCE: 0.

00:41:12.170 --> 00:41:13.890
PROFESSOR: 0, right?

00:41:13.890 --> 00:41:17.280
Because at E1, there is 0 y2.

00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:19.865
So then, of course, y2 dot is 0.

00:41:19.865 --> 00:41:23.340
So it's almost what you
want, but not quite.

00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:25.640
So this condition,
which looks very weird,

00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:30.210
is really saying that, if
we are at E1-- so there's

00:41:30.210 --> 00:41:34.770
no infected type-two
infections-- what we want to do

00:41:34.770 --> 00:41:36.840
is add a little bit of y2.

00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:39.360
And then, we want to
ask, what is y2 dot?

00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:41.000
And this derivative,
evaluated at E1,

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.080
somehow allows you to do that.

00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:46.220
And do we want this
to be greater than 0?

00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:48.060
Or less than 0?

00:41:48.060 --> 00:41:49.661
We're going to do verbal answer.

00:41:49.661 --> 00:41:50.160
Ready?

00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:52.100
Three, two, one.

00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:52.850
AUDIENCE: Greater.

00:41:52.850 --> 00:41:53.750
PROFESSOR: Greater, right.

00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:55.400
Because if it's
saying you add a y2,

00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:56.710
you want y2 to start growing.

00:41:59.610 --> 00:42:01.450
So you want this thing
to be greater than 0.

00:42:01.450 --> 00:42:03.870
And this looks really crazy.

00:42:03.870 --> 00:42:05.370
But it's actually
pretty easy to do.

00:42:05.370 --> 00:42:07.286
Because you take the
derivative of this thing,

00:42:07.286 --> 00:42:08.240
with respect to y2.

00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:11.070
And you just get the thing
in parentheses, right?

00:42:11.070 --> 00:42:12.700
But you evaluated it at E1.

00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:15.400
So it's beta2.

00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:23.954
And this is x star at
E1, minus u, minus v2.

00:42:23.954 --> 00:42:25.620
And this thing has
to be greater than 0.

00:42:28.910 --> 00:42:34.340
But this is x at E1.

00:42:34.340 --> 00:42:38.710
That's u plus v1
divided by beta1.

00:42:38.710 --> 00:42:47.650
So what we have is beta 2, then,
u plus v1 divided by beta1.

00:42:47.650 --> 00:42:50.220
And this thing has to be greater
than-- we'll move this over

00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:53.830
to the other side-- u plus v2.

00:42:53.830 --> 00:42:57.680
OK, so this is not
so horrible, right?

00:42:57.680 --> 00:43:00.610
There's a u plus
v1, beta1, right?

00:43:00.610 --> 00:43:04.839
I just want to make sure I
write-- (WHISPERING) u plus v1.

00:43:04.839 --> 00:43:07.130
(NORMAL VOICE) OK, we have
to these in the denominators

00:43:07.130 --> 00:43:07.671
now, somehow.

00:43:10.730 --> 00:43:13.550
So we'll put divide by
both of these things.

00:43:13.550 --> 00:43:18.250
So we have a 1 divided
by a u plus v2.

00:43:18.250 --> 00:43:21.350
1 divided by u plus v1.

00:43:21.350 --> 00:43:23.820
So we put these things
in the denominator.

00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:26.550
And now, the beta1 is
going to come up here.

00:43:26.550 --> 00:43:30.550
So we have a beta1 and a beta2.

00:43:30.550 --> 00:43:33.420
And there still is
a greater-than sign.

00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:36.250
Did I screw anything up yet?

00:43:36.250 --> 00:43:36.750
Maybe?

00:43:36.750 --> 00:43:37.920
No?

00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:38.420
All right.

00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:43.020
Now, we can do
something wonderful,

00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:45.100
which is we can just
multiply by k divided by u.

00:43:51.918 --> 00:43:53.490
And so what does this say?

00:43:56.822 --> 00:43:58.730
AUDIENCE: R2 is greater than R1.

00:43:58.730 --> 00:44:00.790
PROFESSOR: R2 is
greater than R1, right?

00:44:03.359 --> 00:44:04.900
And what were we
trying to calculate?

00:44:07.671 --> 00:44:09.170
How did we get
started on this math?

00:44:12.044 --> 00:44:13.960
AUDIENCE: What can
[INAUDIBLE] the strains.

00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:15.418
PROFESSOR: Right,
we wanted to ask,

00:44:15.418 --> 00:44:19.000
strain two can invade
the equilibrium one,

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:31.457
if and only if R2 is
greater than-- now,

00:44:31.457 --> 00:44:32.540
that's interesting, right?

00:44:32.540 --> 00:44:34.164
So that's saying
that, if you start out

00:44:34.164 --> 00:44:37.290
with the endemic strain
one and you add the strain

00:44:37.290 --> 00:44:39.590
two in there, it's going
to be able to invade

00:44:39.590 --> 00:44:42.000
if it's R2 is greater than R1.

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:43.720
That's not obvious.

00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:45.600
Because R2 and R1,
that was telling us

00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:47.317
about a different situation.

00:44:47.317 --> 00:44:48.900
That was telling us
about what happens

00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:52.520
when you add those infected
individuals into a population

00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:54.260
of susceptibles.

00:44:54.260 --> 00:44:57.590
But this also ends up
telling us about what

00:44:57.590 --> 00:45:00.860
happens when the strains are
competing against each other.

00:45:00.860 --> 00:45:05.302
So this is so simple
that it feels trivial.

00:45:05.302 --> 00:45:07.260
I'm sure that if you
understood it well enough,

00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:08.093
it would be trivial.

00:45:08.093 --> 00:45:11.540
But you'd have to think
about it more than I have.

00:45:11.540 --> 00:45:13.110
So I think this is surprising.

00:45:13.110 --> 00:45:15.900
Now, you can also ask
the same question,

00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:26.010
which is about whether strain
one can invade strain two.

00:45:26.010 --> 00:45:27.570
And that is kind
of the same thing.

00:45:27.570 --> 00:45:32.840
So it all comes down to
the orderings of R2 and R1.

00:45:32.840 --> 00:45:38.390
And what you find is that, if
this condition is satisfied,

00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:42.140
strain two will drive strain
one out of the population.

00:45:47.996 --> 00:45:50.904
AUDIENCE: What if they
strains are the same?

00:45:50.904 --> 00:45:52.320
PROFESSOR: So if
they're the same,

00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:55.050
then you can get coexistence.

00:45:55.050 --> 00:45:58.920
But as Martin says,
it's non-generic,

00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:02.380
in a sense that it's
kind of a coincidence,

00:46:02.380 --> 00:46:04.810
or it's of measure
0, the situations

00:46:04.810 --> 00:46:10.960
in which the two will have
the same R parameters.

00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:12.674
But of course, you
could imagine--

00:46:12.674 --> 00:46:14.840
just like we talked about
all this neutral evolution

00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:16.770
business-- things
are nearly neutral

00:46:16.770 --> 00:46:19.730
and so forth, da-da-da-- you can
kind of invoke similar ideas.

00:46:19.730 --> 00:46:22.310
Because you can imagine that,
as these two become closer

00:46:22.310 --> 00:46:23.810
and closer to each
other, it's going

00:46:23.810 --> 00:46:27.165
to take longer and longer
for the more-fit strain

00:46:27.165 --> 00:46:28.880
to out-compete the
less-fit strain.

00:46:31.820 --> 00:46:36.310
Now, even though this is
such a simple condition

00:46:36.310 --> 00:46:41.560
and the R parameters have
such a simple physical origin

00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:45.260
or mathematical origin, the
actual expression for the Rs

00:46:45.260 --> 00:46:46.880
is kind of complicated.

00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:48.829
But again, it's a
combination of all

00:46:48.829 --> 00:46:50.620
of these different
parameters, whether it's

00:46:50.620 --> 00:46:52.860
the beta1, B1, or beta2, v2.

00:47:06.190 --> 00:47:08.205
Which board do you
think is least useful?

00:47:13.530 --> 00:47:16.079
Well, I don't want
this one anymore.

00:47:16.079 --> 00:47:17.870
But in particular, we
want to say something

00:47:17.870 --> 00:47:21.510
about the evolution of
virulence in this model

00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:24.577
and what the expectation is.

00:47:24.577 --> 00:47:26.160
So what we're going
to do is I'm going

00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:29.180
to give you some different
situations, in terms

00:47:29.180 --> 00:47:34.220
of how the infectivity
depends upon the virulence.

00:47:34.220 --> 00:47:36.390
And then, you guys
will get to tell me

00:47:36.390 --> 00:47:38.185
how the virulence will evolve.

00:47:55.520 --> 00:48:24.720
Now, this is virulence, v. All
right, so the first situation

00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:30.230
is if beta as a function
of the virulence-- so

00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:35.250
the infectivity as a function
of virulence is, we'll say,

00:48:35.250 --> 00:48:37.110
some beta0.

00:48:37.110 --> 00:48:40.570
So first, the question is,
if the infectivity does not

00:48:40.570 --> 00:48:47.940
depend upon the virulence,
where will virulence go to?

00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:55.460
You have equation, various
places that'll help you.

00:49:07.270 --> 00:49:09.170
Do you need more time?

00:49:09.170 --> 00:49:09.670
No?

00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:14.820
All right, ready,
three, two, one.

00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:16.860
OK, we've got many A's.

00:49:16.860 --> 00:49:17.460
That's great.

00:49:21.690 --> 00:49:25.550
So if it's the case
that the parasite,

00:49:25.550 --> 00:49:28.360
regardless of how rapidly
it's killing the individual,

00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:31.220
has the same rate of getting
to other individuals,

00:49:31.220 --> 00:49:37.220
then we want to make the R0
to get as large as possible.

00:49:37.220 --> 00:49:40.134
So then, we make v go
as small as possible.

00:49:40.134 --> 00:49:42.050
That's the mathematical
thing you can look at.

00:49:42.050 --> 00:49:43.350
And why does this make sense?

00:49:51.093 --> 00:49:52.592
AUDIENCE: You're
killing people off,

00:49:52.592 --> 00:49:54.089
and you're infecting
most people.

00:49:54.089 --> 00:49:55.090
But--

00:49:55.090 --> 00:49:55.940
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:49:55.940 --> 00:50:00.480
So from the standpoint
of the parasite,

00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:03.190
in this situation where the
infectivity doesn't depend

00:50:03.190 --> 00:50:05.080
on the virulence,
well in that case,

00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:06.570
you don't want to
kill your host.

00:50:06.570 --> 00:50:09.530
Because the longer
that the host lives,

00:50:09.530 --> 00:50:11.380
the more other individuals
you can infect.

00:50:14.060 --> 00:50:19.310
And this is the basic statement
underlying the statement

00:50:19.310 --> 00:50:22.960
you often hear that a
well-adapted parasite does not

00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:25.236
harm its host.

00:50:25.236 --> 00:50:26.860
And I think this is
one of those things

00:50:26.860 --> 00:50:29.620
that you can write
down a simple model

00:50:29.620 --> 00:50:32.390
and convince yourself
it should be true.

00:50:32.390 --> 00:50:34.360
You can maybe find
a few case studies

00:50:34.360 --> 00:50:36.180
where it seems to be true.

00:50:36.180 --> 00:50:40.179
But then, you always have to be
careful about how strongly you

00:50:40.179 --> 00:50:41.720
should believe such
a statement based

00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:43.110
on those kinds of evidence.

00:50:43.110 --> 00:50:46.500
Because it's a
very simple model.

00:50:46.500 --> 00:50:49.770
It's making an assumption
that is very likely not true

00:50:49.770 --> 00:50:53.130
and, actually, many assumptions
that are very likely not true.

00:50:53.130 --> 00:50:54.710
And there are counterexamples.

00:50:54.710 --> 00:50:57.590
So Martin talks
about malaria, which

00:50:57.590 --> 00:51:00.110
humans have had for
millions of years,

00:51:00.110 --> 00:51:05.450
and still causes
a lot of problems.

00:51:05.450 --> 00:51:06.950
And so you might
imagine, what would

00:51:06.950 --> 00:51:11.510
happen if the infectivity is
a function of the virulence?

00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:13.960
Maybe it's just proportional
to the virulence.

00:51:13.960 --> 00:51:15.850
And this kind of
would make sense.

00:51:15.850 --> 00:51:19.590
Because you say, oh well,
let's imagine that the number

00:51:19.590 --> 00:51:25.560
of viruses in the host--
that somehow, the virulence

00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:27.070
is proportional to that number.

00:51:27.070 --> 00:51:30.182
And also, the infectivity is
proportional to that number.

00:51:30.182 --> 00:51:31.640
In that case,
infectivity will just

00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:38.330
scale linearly with v. It's kind
of another reasonable world.

00:51:38.330 --> 00:51:42.540
So in this situation, where
does the virulence evolve to?

00:51:42.540 --> 00:51:44.700
We'll think about
this for 10 seconds.

00:52:01.100 --> 00:52:01.660
Ready?

00:52:01.660 --> 00:52:03.480
Three, two, one.

00:52:11.130 --> 00:52:13.780
All right, so now we
actually have votes that

00:52:13.780 --> 00:52:16.010
are pretty distributed around.

00:52:19.310 --> 00:52:21.880
OK, I'm just going to
write down the expression.

00:52:21.880 --> 00:52:23.720
Just because I think
we can do it quickly.

00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:27.399
So now, the R0 is going
to be given by-- we're

00:52:27.399 --> 00:52:28.690
going to be thinking about a 1.

00:52:28.690 --> 00:52:31.120
There's a u plus v down here.

00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:33.730
But beta-- we're going
to put beta here.

00:52:33.730 --> 00:52:39.173
This is an a times v,
and then a k over u.

00:52:39.173 --> 00:52:41.140
Right?

00:52:41.140 --> 00:52:46.161
So if we plot this as a function
of v, what does it look like?

00:52:46.161 --> 00:52:47.862
AUDIENCE: It
monotonically increases.

00:52:47.862 --> 00:52:49.320
PROFESSOR:
Monotonically increases.

00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:52.420
This is a
Michaelis-Menten type form

00:52:52.420 --> 00:52:58.680
where the R0 is a function
of v. It starts out

00:52:58.680 --> 00:52:59.885
linear and, then, saturates.

00:53:04.170 --> 00:53:05.770
Oops, this is not v. This is R0.

00:53:08.540 --> 00:53:14.706
If we want to maximize R0,
then v goes to infinity, right?

00:53:20.060 --> 00:53:22.430
There was one other model
that Martin talked about,

00:53:22.430 --> 00:53:25.745
which was the situation
if the infectivity itself.

00:53:25.745 --> 00:53:28.550
It had a kind of
Michealis-Menten type form.

00:53:28.550 --> 00:53:32.390
And we still have an a there.

00:53:32.390 --> 00:53:38.630
So it's some a,v c plus v. So
this would be the situation

00:53:38.630 --> 00:53:41.360
where, initially, the
infectivity increases with

00:53:41.360 --> 00:53:41.870
virulence.

00:53:41.870 --> 00:53:46.110
But beyond some
virulence, you no longer

00:53:46.110 --> 00:53:47.484
get an increase in infectivity.

00:53:47.484 --> 00:53:49.650
So for example, if it's the
case that every time you

00:53:49.650 --> 00:53:51.884
sneeze on somebody you're
going to infect them,

00:53:51.884 --> 00:53:54.300
then it doesn't matter if you
double the number of viruses

00:53:54.300 --> 00:53:54.966
you have.

00:53:54.966 --> 00:53:56.590
You've still saturated
the infectivity.

00:54:00.700 --> 00:54:07.400
Now, I'll just tell
you that, in this case,

00:54:07.400 --> 00:54:11.540
there ends up being some
intermediate infectivity

00:54:11.540 --> 00:54:14.850
that you evolve to,
which comes here.

00:54:14.850 --> 00:54:16.750
And indeed, this makes sense.

00:54:16.750 --> 00:54:31.590
As c goes to infinity,
so if c is very large,

00:54:31.590 --> 00:54:34.217
then it just looks like this.

00:54:34.217 --> 00:54:35.550
It's divided by something large.

00:54:35.550 --> 00:54:38.530
But in terms of the scaling
with v, it's just linear in v.

00:54:38.530 --> 00:54:42.670
And that means that the evolved
virulence goes very large.

00:54:46.575 --> 00:54:49.850
Does that make sense?

00:54:49.850 --> 00:54:50.350
No?

00:54:50.350 --> 00:54:51.320
OK.

00:54:51.320 --> 00:54:54.560
So I guess what I'm
saying is that, if you're

00:54:54.560 --> 00:55:00.120
in the region where c is
somehow very large, then

00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:02.080
you end up with the
infectivity just being

00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:04.700
proportional to the virulence.

00:55:04.700 --> 00:55:07.580
Because the virulence, the
v here in the denominator,

00:55:07.580 --> 00:55:09.510
doesn't really
contribute very much.

00:55:09.510 --> 00:55:12.076
And that means that it's
going to be the same kind

00:55:12.076 --> 00:55:13.200
of functional form as this.

00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:14.670
Except if it's a divided by c.

00:55:14.670 --> 00:55:16.950
But it's still proportional
to the virulence.

00:55:16.950 --> 00:55:21.772
And that leads to a larger
and larger evolved virulence.

00:55:21.772 --> 00:55:24.240
OK?

00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:24.890
Yep?

00:55:24.890 --> 00:55:25.390
Yes?

00:55:25.390 --> 00:55:29.471
AUDIENCE: Is it possible
to say something

00:55:29.471 --> 00:55:32.894
in actual infection,
what the data is?

00:55:32.894 --> 00:55:33.872
Is it virulunce?

00:55:33.872 --> 00:55:34.880
Or can you [INAUDIBLE]--

00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:35.546
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:55:35.546 --> 00:55:37.296
AUDIENCE: --other than
just these verbal--

00:55:37.296 --> 00:55:38.600
PROFESSOR: Yeah, right.

00:55:38.600 --> 00:55:43.160
So I think, from real data, I
think people do argue about it.

00:55:43.160 --> 00:55:52.180
But I think it seems to be
there is some sense that it

00:55:52.180 --> 00:55:54.020
does plateau.

00:55:54.020 --> 00:55:58.460
But it's an increasing
function of v, but sub-linear.

00:55:58.460 --> 00:56:00.729
And the question is how
strong of a statement

00:56:00.729 --> 00:56:01.520
you can make there.

00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:03.769
Because also, in many cases,
there is super-infection.

00:56:03.769 --> 00:56:07.460
And super-infection tends to
lead to even higher virulence

00:56:07.460 --> 00:56:10.510
than what you would
expect from this.

00:56:10.510 --> 00:56:14.340
Because you're competing against
viruses in the same host.

00:56:14.340 --> 00:56:19.570
So you have to out-compete the
other parasite in the host,

00:56:19.570 --> 00:56:21.340
as well as go on.

00:56:21.340 --> 00:56:23.260
And you don't pay the
full cost associated

00:56:23.260 --> 00:56:25.210
with keeping the host alive.

00:56:25.210 --> 00:56:26.710
So when you have
super-infection,

00:56:26.710 --> 00:56:29.981
there's this notion that
the better strategy,

00:56:29.981 --> 00:56:31.480
from the standpoint
of the parasite,

00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:34.336
can be to just evolve
very high virulence.

00:56:34.336 --> 00:56:35.710
So you're going
to kill the host.

00:56:35.710 --> 00:56:37.340
But you can get out quickly.

00:56:37.340 --> 00:56:41.170
So then, you can imagine
that the less-virulent strain

00:56:41.170 --> 00:56:44.380
was kind of stranded
in that host that died.

00:56:44.380 --> 00:56:46.770
So from that standpoint,
you can think about,

00:56:46.770 --> 00:56:48.650
in some cases, for
a parasite, evolving

00:56:48.650 --> 00:56:52.620
low-virulence is somehow like
some cooperative behavior.

00:56:52.620 --> 00:56:56.810
Because you're keeping
this host alive.

00:56:56.810 --> 00:56:59.010
You're using the
resources in a wise way,

00:56:59.010 --> 00:57:01.240
so that you can infect
other individuals.

00:57:01.240 --> 00:57:03.356
But then, that
kind of strategy is

00:57:03.356 --> 00:57:05.230
susceptible to these
cheating strategies that

00:57:05.230 --> 00:57:07.340
just have high virulence
and kill the host

00:57:07.340 --> 00:57:09.645
and, then, get on to a new host.

00:57:09.645 --> 00:57:11.730
Yeah, so I think there
are enough of these issues

00:57:11.730 --> 00:57:16.370
that it's hard to take
any of this too seriously.

00:57:16.370 --> 00:57:18.590
I would say that,
perhaps, where this field

00:57:18.590 --> 00:57:22.375
has had the biggest impact is
in the context of vaccinations.

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:34.840
Because you can really measure
R0 for many different diseases.

00:57:34.840 --> 00:57:36.430
And I think that's
somehow easier

00:57:36.430 --> 00:57:37.846
to measure than
many other things.

00:57:37.846 --> 00:57:42.700
Because you can try to
do tracing of infections.

00:57:42.700 --> 00:57:45.620
So if you think about
somebody that gets infected

00:57:45.620 --> 00:57:48.040
and moves to a new city
or lands in a new city,

00:57:48.040 --> 00:57:50.840
you can try to figure
out who they infected.

00:57:50.840 --> 00:57:55.250
So then, you can go and
measure these R0 parameters.

00:57:55.250 --> 00:57:58.410
And of course, the diseases
that we worry about

00:57:58.410 --> 00:58:01.810
tend to have R0s larger than 1.

00:58:01.810 --> 00:58:04.630
And how large they are tells
you about how difficult

00:58:04.630 --> 00:58:09.470
the vaccination will be
in order to be successful

00:58:09.470 --> 00:58:12.800
and to remove the disease
from the population.

00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:15.520
So if you're curious, after
class, you can come up.

00:58:15.520 --> 00:58:18.550
And there's a nice
table that I have here

00:58:18.550 --> 00:58:21.550
for smallpox, measles,
whooping cough, German measles,

00:58:21.550 --> 00:58:23.881
chickenpox, diphtheria,
scarlet fever, mumps,

00:58:23.881 --> 00:58:24.630
and poliomielitis.

00:58:27.240 --> 00:58:34.456
Estimates of R0s-- and
they kind of range 5 to 15,

00:58:34.456 --> 00:58:36.680
to give you a sense.

00:58:36.680 --> 00:58:40.820
And so, if you want
to remove the disease

00:58:40.820 --> 00:58:43.300
from the population,
what is it that changes?

00:58:43.300 --> 00:58:47.230
--in terms of vaccination, in
order to remove the disease.

00:58:55.260 --> 00:58:55.760
Yes?

00:58:55.760 --> 00:58:58.586
AUDIENCE: In R0, then,
the [INAUDIBLE] for u,

00:58:58.586 --> 00:59:02.230
as the population
available [INAUDIBLE].

00:59:02.230 --> 00:59:03.230
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:59:03.230 --> 00:59:07.189
So by vaccinating
you're removing

00:59:07.189 --> 00:59:08.980
susceptible individuals
from the population

00:59:08.980 --> 00:59:11.420
and making them
resistant somehow.

00:59:11.420 --> 00:59:15.670
And the R0 parameter tells
you about what fraction

00:59:15.670 --> 00:59:17.670
of the population you
have to vaccinate in order

00:59:17.670 --> 00:59:20.830
to remove the parasite
from the population.

00:59:20.830 --> 00:59:23.230
And so, basically,
you have to vaccinate

00:59:23.230 --> 00:59:29.000
a fraction, a percentage, p
that's greater than 1 minus 1

00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:30.630
over R0.

00:59:30.630 --> 00:59:33.850
So as R0 gets very
large, it means

00:59:33.850 --> 00:59:37.770
that you have to vaccinate,
essentially, everybody.

00:59:37.770 --> 00:59:39.787
So if you have R0
of, say, five--

00:59:39.787 --> 00:59:41.620
which is typical of
many of these diseases--

00:59:41.620 --> 00:59:44.170
it's saying you
have to vaccinate

00:59:44.170 --> 00:59:46.260
80% of the population.

00:59:46.260 --> 00:59:48.084
You can never get to 100%.

00:59:48.084 --> 00:59:49.500
And that's why
it's very difficult

00:59:49.500 --> 00:59:53.860
to get rid of these
diseases with large R0s.

00:59:53.860 --> 00:59:58.730
And incidentally, they note that
smallpox has an R0 of 3 to 5.

01:00:01.330 --> 01:00:03.960
And this always depends
on the environment.

01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:06.420
But in the case
where they measured,

01:00:06.420 --> 01:00:10.380
smallpox R0 is 3 to 5.

01:00:10.380 --> 01:00:12.027
And this is sort of
small, as compared

01:00:12.027 --> 01:00:13.110
to many of these diseases.

01:00:13.110 --> 01:00:17.660
And this is telling us
that smallpox is easier

01:00:17.660 --> 01:00:19.360
to get rid of via
vaccinations than many

01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:20.360
of these other diseases.

01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:24.940
And indeed, the
vaccination procedures

01:00:24.940 --> 01:00:28.882
have been more successful
in smallpox than the others.

01:00:28.882 --> 01:00:31.740
AUDIENCE: Do you
know what is 3, 4?

01:00:31.740 --> 01:00:32.750
PROFESSOR: I don't.

01:00:32.750 --> 01:00:35.070
But maybe in the
next 20 minutes,

01:00:35.070 --> 01:00:38.580
somebody can Google this.

01:00:38.580 --> 01:00:41.450
We can estimate this
right now, though.

01:00:41.450 --> 01:00:42.840
We've had, what?

01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:45.710
--five Ebola patients
come to the United States.

01:00:45.710 --> 01:00:49.470
And we've gotten two
or three infections.

01:00:49.470 --> 01:00:51.815
So I'll say, 3/5.

01:00:51.815 --> 01:00:53.342
[LAUGHTER]

01:00:53.342 --> 01:00:55.300
It obviously depends on
the environment, right?

01:00:55.300 --> 01:00:57.040
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:00:57.040 --> 01:00:57.665
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:00:57.665 --> 01:00:59.623
AUDIENCE: I mean, I guess
that was my question.

01:00:59.623 --> 01:01:01.449
You're not going to
take someone with Ebola

01:01:01.449 --> 01:01:05.097
and throw them in New York
City and just measure how

01:01:05.097 --> 01:01:06.235
many people they infect.

01:01:06.235 --> 01:01:06.690
PROFESSOR: That's right.

01:01:06.690 --> 01:01:07.145
AUDIENCE: So--

01:01:07.145 --> 01:01:08.060
AUDIENCE: That would
be [INAUDIBLE].

01:01:08.060 --> 01:01:09.005
AUDIENCE: Like--

01:01:09.005 --> 01:01:09.921
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:01:09.921 --> 01:01:12.327
PROFESSOR: Yeah, but
the thing is, you

01:01:12.327 --> 01:01:14.160
don't have to do anything
that's so immoral.

01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:15.630
Because what you're
interested in

01:01:15.630 --> 01:01:18.309
is the R0 for individual
in an actual environment

01:01:18.309 --> 01:01:19.850
that they're actually
going to be in.

01:01:19.850 --> 01:01:24.210
So this is a situation where the
doctor comes back from Africa

01:01:24.210 --> 01:01:27.170
after working with
Doctors Without Borders.

01:01:27.170 --> 01:01:29.704
In this day and age, he knows
that he has to watch out

01:01:29.704 --> 01:01:30.620
for a fever, da-da-da.

01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:32.910
And then, if he gets
a fever, he calls in.

01:01:32.910 --> 01:01:34.440
And he's brought
to the hospital.

01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:36.240
And that's the world that
we're interested in of what

01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:36.950
the R0 is.

01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:40.050
It's not the world in which
there's fevers everywhere

01:01:40.050 --> 01:01:43.470
and nobody knows.

01:01:43.470 --> 01:01:45.280
So the R0 in the
United States is

01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:50.108
going to be much lower
than the R0 somewhere else.

01:01:50.108 --> 01:01:51.056
Yeah?

01:01:51.056 --> 01:01:53.599
AUDIENCE: Is there enough
of R0 for a disease that you

01:01:53.599 --> 01:01:54.848
don't transmit between people?

01:01:54.848 --> 01:01:56.952
You get malaria of the plague--

01:01:56.952 --> 01:01:57.910
PROFESSOR: Yeah, right.

01:01:57.910 --> 01:02:03.024
So I think that you could try
to generate a similar kind of R0

01:02:03.024 --> 01:02:03.940
for those to diseases.

01:02:03.940 --> 01:02:05.990
Although, it's going
to be very muddled,

01:02:05.990 --> 01:02:08.540
in the case of where you have
all the vectors and so forth.

01:02:08.540 --> 01:02:13.830
Because it's not
even clear-- yeah,

01:02:13.830 --> 01:02:16.360
I'm hesitant to say too much.

01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:18.736
Because I don't know anything.

01:02:18.736 --> 01:02:20.155
AUDIENCE: According
to Wikipedia,

01:02:20.155 --> 01:02:23.315
it's like 1.5 to 2.5.

01:02:23.315 --> 01:02:24.190
PROFESSOR: For Ebola?

01:02:24.190 --> 01:02:24.550
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:02:24.550 --> 01:02:25.216
PROFESSOR: Here?

01:02:25.216 --> 01:02:26.522
Or in--

01:02:26.522 --> 01:02:31.076
AUDIENCE: It says the 2014
West Africa aggregate.

01:02:31.076 --> 01:02:33.876
PROFESSOR: Ah, so this
is in West Africa then.

01:02:33.876 --> 01:02:34.750
AUDIENCE: Apparently.

01:02:34.750 --> 01:02:35.458
PROFESSOR: Right.

01:02:35.458 --> 01:02:38.460
Yeah And it has obviously
spread exponentially,

01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:40.779
which means it had to
have been larger than 1.

01:02:40.779 --> 01:02:43.320
And I think it's important to
remember that, just because you

01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:47.130
have a chart with a bunch of
R0s, this is not set in stone.

01:02:47.130 --> 01:02:50.640
Public policy, hygiene, and
everything changes this.

01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:52.850
And we'd like to drive it down.

01:02:52.850 --> 01:02:54.258
Was there a question
in the back?

01:02:54.258 --> 01:02:56.620
AUDIENCE: I just was
going to say about two.

01:02:56.620 --> 01:02:57.995
PROFESSOR: Same
thing, about two.

01:02:57.995 --> 01:03:02.170
OK, so that means that we
could actually, in principle,

01:03:02.170 --> 01:03:03.950
vaccinate against Ebola.

01:03:03.950 --> 01:03:07.580
We'd only have to get over 50%
of the population vaccinated

01:03:07.580 --> 01:03:08.230
in West Africa.

01:03:08.230 --> 01:03:11.940
And then, we can maybe make it
so it cannot spread and become

01:03:11.940 --> 01:03:12.750
an epidemic.

01:03:12.750 --> 01:03:17.434
Of course, we need to
have a vaccine first.

01:03:17.434 --> 01:03:19.046
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:03:19.046 --> 01:03:20.670
PROFESSOR: So I think
I'm going to skip

01:03:20.670 --> 01:03:22.350
the discussion of SIR models.

01:03:22.350 --> 01:03:24.670
Because you are going to
play with some of them

01:03:24.670 --> 01:03:27.140
in the context of
your problem set.

01:03:27.140 --> 01:03:30.180
And if you just Google
SIR, you can find it.

01:03:30.180 --> 01:03:31.712
And a very similar
kind of intuition

01:03:31.712 --> 01:03:32.920
that you get from this model.

01:03:35.895 --> 01:03:38.270
Because I do want to spend
the last 15 minutes, at least,

01:03:38.270 --> 01:03:39.728
talking about the
evolution of sex.

01:03:39.728 --> 01:03:41.850
Because it is an
interesting topic.

01:03:41.850 --> 01:03:47.126
And I think the paper is
a nice discussion of it.

01:03:54.920 --> 01:04:00.540
So can somebody say why it is
that this is a puzzle at all?

01:04:11.408 --> 01:04:13.813
Yeah?

01:04:13.813 --> 01:04:15.854
AUDIENCE: In almost all
the situations we imagine

01:04:15.854 --> 01:04:19.806
and things that can be
[INAUDIBLE] introduce much

01:04:19.806 --> 01:04:21.501
faster, even violating
the [INAUDIBLE]--

01:04:21.501 --> 01:04:22.500
PROFESSOR: That's right.

01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:25.634
AUDIENCE: --80%
[INAUDIBLE] right?

01:04:25.634 --> 01:04:29.130
PROFESSOR: So sex is costly,
and in particular, if you have

01:04:29.130 --> 01:04:33.130
this obligate bi-parental sex.

01:04:33.130 --> 01:04:37.795
In particular, there's
the so-called twofold cost

01:04:37.795 --> 01:04:38.295
of males.

01:04:41.670 --> 01:04:44.200
Because you can imagine
comparing these two

01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:47.660
populations, one of which
has both males and females.

01:04:47.660 --> 01:04:51.984
And one of them is just,
maybe, reproducing asexually,

01:04:51.984 --> 01:04:53.900
or parthenogenetically,
or hermaphroditically,

01:04:53.900 --> 01:04:56.310
or what not.

01:04:56.310 --> 01:04:59.810
And so, if you have
a male and a female,

01:04:59.810 --> 01:05:01.570
then on average, if
they have two kids,

01:05:01.570 --> 01:05:03.999
you end up with another
male and a female.

01:05:03.999 --> 01:05:06.040
And of course, this could
be many different males

01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:06.539
and females.

01:05:06.539 --> 01:05:08.990
So you don't have to have
any sibling anything.

01:05:08.990 --> 01:05:15.125
But if, every
generation, each female

01:05:15.125 --> 01:05:18.610
is giving birth to
two progeny, then you

01:05:18.610 --> 01:05:20.610
end up with a constant
population size.

01:05:20.610 --> 01:05:22.970
Whereas, if you started
out in a population

01:05:22.970 --> 01:05:25.950
with just two females
and they were reproducing

01:05:25.950 --> 01:05:32.290
hermaphroditically, then you
end up with-- whatever-- more.

01:05:32.290 --> 01:05:33.660
8.

01:05:33.660 --> 01:05:35.650
So you can see that
you get a factor of 2

01:05:35.650 --> 01:05:38.096
in the rate of exponential
growth of the population.

01:05:38.096 --> 01:05:38.596
Yeah?

01:05:38.596 --> 01:05:41.054
AUDIENCE: Well, it seems to me
the question is not why sex,

01:05:41.054 --> 01:05:42.932
but it's why males.

01:05:42.932 --> 01:05:44.670
Right, I mean--

01:05:44.670 --> 01:05:46.010
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:05:46.010 --> 01:05:52.150
So I think this is the
most extreme cost of sex.

01:05:52.150 --> 01:05:55.400
But then, also, you can
think about even just

01:05:55.400 --> 01:05:57.730
horizontal gene-transfer
among bacteria.

01:05:57.730 --> 01:05:59.740
It's a costly behavior
in some way or another.

01:05:59.740 --> 01:06:02.010
It's not as costly as this.

01:06:02.010 --> 01:06:05.670
But if you're going to
think about bacteria

01:06:05.670 --> 01:06:08.440
in their competence state,
when B. subtilis kind of pulls

01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:10.630
in DNA, it stops dividing.

01:06:10.630 --> 01:06:12.930
And then, it enters a state
where it reels things in.

01:06:12.930 --> 01:06:17.530
And it can pick up DNA that
may be harmful in some cases.

01:06:17.530 --> 01:06:23.042
So there are various costs
for, if you want to call it,

01:06:23.042 --> 01:06:24.250
horizontal gene-transfer sex.

01:06:26.970 --> 01:06:29.100
So the key thing of
sexual reproduction

01:06:29.100 --> 01:06:33.020
is it somehow is the
sharing of the DNA.

01:06:33.020 --> 01:06:36.730
And I'd say that this can
either be relatively low cost

01:06:36.730 --> 01:06:37.739
or relatively high cost.

01:06:37.739 --> 01:06:39.530
But this is the most
extreme version of it.

01:06:39.530 --> 01:06:44.560
And I'd say, as a
species that reproduces

01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:46.520
with obligate
bi-parental sex, then

01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:52.770
I'd say that, not only
humans, but almost all animals

01:06:52.770 --> 01:06:55.500
have this form of reproduction.

01:06:55.500 --> 01:06:57.420
I would say it's
sort of surprising,

01:06:57.420 --> 01:06:59.130
given that this is a huge cost.

01:07:01.484 --> 01:07:02.900
But it's not that
all species that

01:07:02.900 --> 01:07:05.480
engage in any sort
of gene-transfer

01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:07.190
bear this large of a cost.

01:07:07.190 --> 01:07:09.100
But they bear more modest costs.

01:07:09.100 --> 01:07:13.410
AUDIENCE: Well, although,
other species do-- even

01:07:13.410 --> 01:07:15.310
with this [INAUDIBLE],
it's like having

01:07:15.310 --> 01:07:18.668
multiple children per sex.

01:07:18.668 --> 01:07:21.126
PROFESSOR: You're saying that
they can just have more kids.

01:07:21.126 --> 01:07:21.980
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I mean--

01:07:21.980 --> 01:07:23.620
PROFESSOR: Yeah, although the
basic statement is still true.

01:07:23.620 --> 01:07:26.349
Let's say that these
females all have three kids.

01:07:26.349 --> 01:07:27.640
They get to grow exponentially.

01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:29.210
But then, these
guys grow faster.

01:07:29.210 --> 01:07:31.793
And ultimately, there's going
to be competition for resources.

01:07:31.793 --> 01:07:33.575
And these ones will still win.

01:07:33.575 --> 01:07:34.200
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:35.674
PROFESSOR: So the
question is-- you

01:07:35.674 --> 01:07:37.340
can imagine you have
a population that's

01:07:37.340 --> 01:07:40.480
reproducing sexually-- if one
female has a mutation that

01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:43.744
leads her to start
reproducing parthogenetically,

01:07:43.744 --> 01:07:45.410
that mutation you'd
expect should spread

01:07:45.410 --> 01:07:47.900
throughout the
population very rapidly.

01:07:47.900 --> 01:07:50.550
And indeed, there are these
cases of, for example,

01:07:50.550 --> 01:07:53.950
sharks held in captivity
where a female held

01:07:53.950 --> 01:07:56.370
in captivity for years
eventually gives birth

01:07:56.370 --> 01:07:58.925
to daughters.

01:08:02.780 --> 01:08:05.100
So this sort of virgin
birth is possible.

01:08:05.100 --> 01:08:07.275
I'm not aware-- well, I'm
not going to talk about--

01:08:07.275 --> 01:08:08.280
[LAUGHTER]

01:08:10.730 --> 01:08:15.520
But in some animals, it is
at least possible, I'll say.

01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:18.870
So then, you have
to ask, well, what

01:08:18.870 --> 01:08:22.220
kind of selective advantage
could sexual reproduction have

01:08:22.220 --> 01:08:25.460
that could possibly compensate
for this so-called twofold cost

01:08:25.460 --> 01:08:27.727
of sex or twofold cost of males?

01:08:30.910 --> 01:08:36.120
And what is the argument
that's made in this paper?

01:08:54.220 --> 01:08:54.720
Anybody?

01:08:58.828 --> 01:08:59.780
Yes?

01:08:59.780 --> 01:09:03.588
AUDIENCE: The recombination
favors genetic diversity.

01:09:03.588 --> 01:09:04.910
PROFESSOR: That's right.

01:09:04.910 --> 01:09:07.880
This recombination is
favoring genetic diversity.

01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:10.260
So there are a number
of different mechanisms.

01:09:10.260 --> 01:09:13.399
I'd say that at the heart of
this idea of the Red Queen

01:09:13.399 --> 01:09:17.330
hypothesis is-- let
me see if I can find

01:09:17.330 --> 01:09:21.060
the actual quote for you guys.

01:09:21.060 --> 01:09:21.700
Maybe not.

01:09:24.229 --> 01:09:26.840
So it's from a
Lewis Carroll novel,

01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:28.290
Through the Looking Glass.

01:09:28.290 --> 01:09:31.845
The quote was something--
run-- oh, shoot.

01:09:37.370 --> 01:09:39.740
Never mind, I can't
remember what the quote was.

01:09:39.740 --> 01:09:44.010
But the idea is that
sexual reproduction

01:09:44.010 --> 01:09:46.830
may allow a population
to adapt against, say,

01:09:46.830 --> 01:09:49.830
changing environments
more rapidly.

01:09:49.830 --> 01:09:51.580
And this has a
couple of reasons.

01:09:51.580 --> 01:09:53.910
Because you generate
genetic diversity.

01:09:53.910 --> 01:09:56.565
You don't have the same
clonal interference effects

01:09:56.565 --> 01:09:58.650
that we talked about earlier.

01:09:58.650 --> 01:10:00.780
So if you have asexual
lineages, then,

01:10:00.780 --> 01:10:02.640
if you have two
beneficial mutations,

01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:04.960
they cannot both fix.

01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:06.647
So the more fit version
is going to fix.

01:10:06.647 --> 01:10:08.480
And then, you have to
wait for the next one.

01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:11.360
Whereas, in sexually
reproducing populations,

01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:14.240
those genes can spread
throughout the population,

01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:16.390
sort of as genes,
rather than being tied

01:10:16.390 --> 01:10:18.007
to a particular individual.

01:10:18.007 --> 01:10:20.590
So that means that, if you find
yourself in a new environment,

01:10:20.590 --> 01:10:23.140
it may be the case that
sexual reproduction can

01:10:23.140 --> 01:10:25.670
allow for the population
to adapt more rapidly.

01:10:25.670 --> 01:10:28.671
But on one hand, you might say,
well, the environment's always

01:10:28.671 --> 01:10:29.170
changing.

01:10:29.170 --> 01:10:31.030
So that can always favor
the sexually reproducing

01:10:31.030 --> 01:10:31.550
populations.

01:10:31.550 --> 01:10:33.680
But then, there's
a feeling out there

01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:35.760
that maybe that's not
enough, in the sense

01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:37.800
that the environment
is not changing

01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:39.520
rapidly enough and
dramatically enough

01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:43.880
to force the population to
reproduce sexually as compared

01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:46.270
to asexually.

01:10:46.270 --> 01:10:49.040
And so, the proposal from
the Red Queen Hypothesis

01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:52.060
is that the constantly
changing environment

01:10:52.060 --> 01:10:55.870
is a result of
co-evolution between hosts

01:10:55.870 --> 01:10:57.930
and their parasites.

01:10:57.930 --> 01:11:01.650
Because parasites are always
trying to target common host

01:11:01.650 --> 01:11:02.180
genotypes.

01:11:02.180 --> 01:11:04.490
Because they can
spread on those.

01:11:04.490 --> 01:11:06.140
So the parasites are evolving.

01:11:06.140 --> 01:11:08.860
And then, the host
populations or genotypes

01:11:08.860 --> 01:11:11.570
are kind of being chased
away by those parasites that

01:11:11.570 --> 01:11:12.860
are targeting them.

01:11:12.860 --> 01:11:16.120
So the notion is that
parasites, as a result

01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:18.800
of this co-evolution, can be
the source for the constantly

01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:23.440
changing environment that may
be driving the evolution of sex.

01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:23.940
Yeah?

01:11:23.940 --> 01:11:26.910
AUDIENCE: And this, proportional
with [INAUDIBLE], bacteria

01:11:26.910 --> 01:11:30.870
also get parasites [INAUDIBLE].

01:11:30.870 --> 01:11:32.899
PROFESSOR: That's right.

01:11:32.899 --> 01:11:35.800
AUDIENCE: So--

01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:38.440
PROFESSOR: Yes, so is
the question is why--

01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:40.530
AUDIENCE: Why only in multi--

01:11:40.530 --> 01:11:42.260
PROFESSOR: Right.

01:11:42.260 --> 01:11:45.690
So I can give you my
best guess on this.

01:11:45.690 --> 01:11:49.090
First of all, not everybody
agrees that the Red Queen

01:11:49.090 --> 01:11:52.200
Hypothesis is the
true explanation,

01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:55.730
if a true explanation
even exists.

01:11:55.730 --> 01:11:58.120
But within this
framework, you definitely

01:11:58.120 --> 01:12:04.030
want to try to explain why it
is that large life forms seem

01:12:04.030 --> 01:12:06.350
to have a lot of obligate
sexual reproduction.

01:12:06.350 --> 01:12:08.711
Because this is a very
strong pattern that you see.

01:12:08.711 --> 01:12:10.960
And I guess what I would say
is that there's certainly

01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:17.620
a correlation between physical
size and generation time.

01:12:17.620 --> 01:12:19.490
And generation time
tells you something

01:12:19.490 --> 01:12:22.130
about the typical time scales
over which you can evolve.

01:12:22.130 --> 01:12:23.920
So my sense of this
is it just maybe

01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:29.190
that, in general, large
animals, by their nature,

01:12:29.190 --> 01:12:32.552
will evolve rather slowly as
compared to their parasites.

01:12:32.552 --> 01:12:34.760
And so, that means that they
are the populations that

01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:41.200
are most in need of
speeding up their evolution.

01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:44.180
And it's hard to know how
convincing that argument

01:12:44.180 --> 01:12:44.680
should be.

01:12:44.680 --> 01:12:48.640
But-- yes?

01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:52.922
AUDIENCE: What's the difference
in reproductive productive time

01:12:52.922 --> 01:12:55.916
between phage and bacteria?

01:12:55.916 --> 01:12:57.912
Like, how fast does phage--

01:12:57.912 --> 01:12:59.120
PROFESSOR: Right.

01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:03.230
So bacteria can--
as we've discussed,

01:13:03.230 --> 01:13:05.870
division times are order hour.

01:13:05.870 --> 01:13:11.410
And phage-- when you get a
phage infection, what happens

01:13:11.410 --> 01:13:14.250
is that the phage you can
infect as a single phage.

01:13:14.250 --> 01:13:21.130
And then, they will divide
within the bacterial cell

01:13:21.130 --> 01:13:24.986
and then burst out as
a population of 100,

01:13:24.986 --> 01:13:26.890
200-- typical of phage.

01:13:26.890 --> 01:13:30.800
And I think that that
might take four or five

01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:32.240
hours, is kind of my sense.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.180
And then, they go off and
they find new bacteria.

01:13:37.180 --> 01:13:42.181
So in that sense, it's a little
bit faster than the bacteria,

01:13:42.181 --> 01:13:42.681
I'd say.

01:13:49.070 --> 01:13:52.320
So can somebody say what the
core experiment was that they

01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:53.670
did in this experiment?

01:14:15.538 --> 01:14:17.029
Yes?

01:14:17.029 --> 01:14:25.975
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
and one time,

01:14:25.975 --> 01:14:29.951
it was reproducing
asexually when they always

01:14:29.951 --> 01:14:31.442
produce sexually.

01:14:31.442 --> 01:14:33.001
And the other time,
it was dividing.

01:14:33.001 --> 01:14:34.000
PROFESSOR: That's right.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:40.232
So this worm, C. Elegans--
sort of a millimeter in size--

01:14:40.232 --> 01:14:42.440
and there are going to be
three different conditions.

01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:51.270
One is the wild type that can
out-cross, can have males mate.

01:14:51.270 --> 01:14:54.510
Then, there's the
obligate out-crossing,

01:14:54.510 --> 01:15:00.310
which means they have
to mate with males.

01:15:00.310 --> 01:15:03.950
And then, there's the--
what did they call it?

01:15:06.759 --> 01:15:07.550
--obligate selfing.

01:15:13.505 --> 01:15:14.005
OK.

01:15:18.870 --> 01:15:23.146
And then, what they
do with those worms?

01:15:23.146 --> 01:15:25.122
AUDIENCE: They put
them right back

01:15:25.122 --> 01:15:31.121
to [INAUDIBLE] more typical.

01:15:31.121 --> 01:15:32.120
PROFESSOR: That's right.

01:15:32.120 --> 01:15:37.360
So then, there's a bacterial
pathogen, Serratia marcescens.

01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:41.610
And they're going to have these
three different conditions.

01:15:41.610 --> 01:15:45.300
For the SM, the
bacteria, they're

01:15:45.300 --> 01:15:51.520
either going to allow
for co-evolution, where

01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:54.670
they take the bacteria
from each of the infections

01:15:54.670 --> 01:15:55.940
and propagate.

01:15:55.940 --> 01:16:00.180
Or they're going to do the
no evolution, where you just

01:16:00.180 --> 01:16:03.060
compete against the ancestor.

01:16:03.060 --> 01:16:04.190
And there's also a control.

01:16:04.190 --> 01:16:05.720
So there's co-evolution.

01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:08.544
There's this no evolution
of the bacteria.

01:16:08.544 --> 01:16:10.960
And then, there's also control,
where there's no bacteria.

01:16:17.246 --> 01:16:18.745
And what was the
most striking thing

01:16:18.745 --> 01:16:20.120
that they saw in
this experiment?

01:16:28.825 --> 01:16:32.290
AUDIENCE: I guess I would
say that the obligate-selfing

01:16:32.290 --> 01:16:33.990
population died in evolution.

01:16:33.990 --> 01:16:35.020
PROFESSOR: That's right.

01:16:35.020 --> 01:16:39.140
So if you allowed the
bacteria to be evolving,

01:16:39.140 --> 01:16:44.659
against this obligately
selfing population,

01:16:44.659 --> 01:16:45.575
this killed the worms.

01:16:48.740 --> 01:16:50.430
And what was the
other thing that

01:16:50.430 --> 01:16:55.060
was, maybe, very striking
about their experiment?

01:16:55.060 --> 01:16:56.530
Yeah.

01:16:56.530 --> 01:17:00.889
AUDIENCE: The worms that did
the out-cross or self increased.

01:17:00.889 --> 01:17:01.430
[INAUDIBLE]--

01:17:01.430 --> 01:17:03.510
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so this
was kind of amazing.

01:17:03.510 --> 01:17:06.130
So they saw, as a
function of time,

01:17:06.130 --> 01:17:10.400
if you look at out-crossing--
the rate of mating

01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:15.340
with the males-- this
started out at, like, 0.2.

01:17:15.340 --> 01:17:19.130
And then, in the presence of
the co-evolution, it went up.

01:17:19.130 --> 01:17:22.510
And it goes up to, maybe, 80%.

01:17:25.760 --> 01:17:29.470
And for co-evolution,
it stayed up high.

01:17:29.470 --> 01:17:35.250
Whereas, if the
wild-type worms continued

01:17:35.250 --> 01:17:38.780
to be just challenged by
the ancestral bacteria,

01:17:38.780 --> 01:17:39.890
it initially came up.

01:17:39.890 --> 01:17:41.324
But then, it came back down.

01:17:41.324 --> 01:17:42.490
So this is the co-evolution.

01:17:45.340 --> 01:17:51.950
And this is the ancestral SM.

01:17:51.950 --> 01:17:54.205
So there was a sense that
that wild-type population

01:17:54.205 --> 01:17:57.040
had initially evolved
to out-cross more.

01:17:57.040 --> 01:17:59.040
But then, once it had
solved this problem of how

01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:01.249
to handle the
ancestral Serratia,

01:18:01.249 --> 01:18:02.790
the out-crossing
rate went back down.

01:18:05.450 --> 01:18:07.550
So we are pretty
much out of time.

01:18:07.550 --> 01:18:09.869
But I don't know
if you guys noticed

01:18:09.869 --> 01:18:11.160
the last sentence of the paper.

01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:15.405
It is amazing that they got
this through the publication

01:18:15.405 --> 01:18:15.905
process.

01:18:18.810 --> 01:18:21.100
All right, so they
say, "taken together,

01:18:21.100 --> 01:18:24.150
the results demonstrate that
sex can facilitate adaptation

01:18:24.150 --> 01:18:25.700
to novel environments.

01:18:25.700 --> 01:18:27.620
But the long-term
maintenance of sex

01:18:27.620 --> 01:18:30.396
requires that the novelty
does not wear off."

01:18:30.396 --> 01:18:31.870
[LAUGHTER]

01:18:31.870 --> 01:18:36.310
It's one of those things that
you read and you think-- OK.

01:18:36.310 --> 01:18:38.570
So I will leave that
sentence with you.

01:18:38.570 --> 01:18:43.670
And then, we'll
meet on Tuesday, OK?
