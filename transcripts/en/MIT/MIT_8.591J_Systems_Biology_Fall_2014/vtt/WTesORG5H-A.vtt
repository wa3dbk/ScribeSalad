00:00:21.312 --> 00:00:23.270
PROFESSOR: Why don't we
go ahead and get going.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.420
Today what we want
to do is talk about

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:26.650
predator/prey interactions.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.393
In particular, how a predator
and its associated prey

00:00:29.393 --> 00:00:32.860
can in principal
oscillate over time.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.700
Now in this area there's this
very important model block,

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.311
a Volterra model,
that has been used

00:00:40.311 --> 00:00:41.560
as kind of the standard model.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.851
It's given us some intuition
for how this might happen.

00:00:43.851 --> 00:00:46.830
But mathematical
biologists really

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.165
don't like this model very
much, because the oscillations

00:00:50.165 --> 00:00:54.010
that it give are neutral,
or neutrally stable

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.440
cycles or orbits.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.520
What I mean is that
it's not a limit cycle.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.390
It doesn't have a characteristic
amplitude, nor a period.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.420
And associated with that--
and it's not a concidence--

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.430
and associated with
it, what it means

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.060
is that if you make sort
of very small modifications

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.640
to the model, then you can
get qualitatively different

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:13.140
outcomes.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.470
In particular, you can either
abolish the cycles-- i.e.,

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.130
you can turn these
neutrally stable orbits

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.190
into stable limits--
or I'm sorry.

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.120
Into a stable spiral.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.824
So it may have damped
the oscillations.

00:01:25.824 --> 00:01:27.990
So it could be that the
oscillations kind of go away

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.730
over time.

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.680
Or it could be that you turn
them into true limit cycle

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.530
oscillations.

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.290
And this could just be from
very small changes in the model.

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.900
That's associated with this
fact that the logical Volterra

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.217
model was neutrally stable.

00:01:40.217 --> 00:01:42.050
Then we'll kind of
switch gears a little bit

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.080
and talk about
these experiments--

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.350
that Yoshida paper that you
guys read-- where they looked

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.310
at this question of what
happens in kind of a laboratory

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.450
experiment where you have
a predator and its prey.

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:54.920
And in particular
what they found

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.050
is that if there is evolution
in the prey population,

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.710
that you can get qualitatively
different oscillations

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:02.530
in particular.

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.946
Instead of having a 90 degree
phase shift between predator

00:02:04.946 --> 00:02:07.690
and prey, you can end
up with 180 degrees

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.830
phase shift, so kind of
anti-correlated oscillations.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.400
But also that the oscillations
could be much longer than what

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.899
you'd.

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:17.240
Expect

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.840
And finally we'll
say something about

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.640
these noise-induced
oscillations, which

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.120
I believe that
you guys have been

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:28.540
playing with a bit in the
context of your homework.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:29.670
Is it the next one?

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:30.870
Oh, I get it.

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.650
Well, you will get a chance
to play with a great deal.

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.240
So pay attention then.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.110
All right.

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.290
Any questions
before we get going?

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.180
Problem set's due tomorrow so
that you can enjoy Thanksgiving

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.780
with your family or friends.

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.506
And then we'll have
one more problem set.

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.480
So this Lotka-Volterra model.

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.330
There's kind of a
fun history of this,

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:05.570
which I'll tell you about.

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.857
But I just want to
highlight that there

00:03:09.857 --> 00:03:12.190
are two important things that
you should be remembering.

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.680
And I'm getting these two
points from Mark Kot in his book

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.400
Elements of Theoretical
Ecology, where

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.150
he says there are two things you
need to know about this model.

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.290
One is that it's a bad model.

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.890
And of course you can
argue what you mean by bad.

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:29.420
I think it's maybe
overstating it.

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.790
But we'll try to be explicit
about why he might say that.

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.500
But then it's sort of
profoundly important.

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.260
He kind of says from a
historical perspective.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.840
But I would say that maybe
both of these statements

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:45.720
are sort of true.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.810
It's a bad model
mathematically in some ways,

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.570
because it's somehow
structurally unstable, but also

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:51.450
profoundly important.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.800
The mark of
intelligence is being

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.810
able to keep two incompatible
ideas in your mind

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.230
at the same time.

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.120
Somebody said
something like that.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.780
More than two?

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.166
OK.

00:04:04.166 --> 00:04:06.290
Well, we'll try to figure
out what we mean by this.

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:07.750
All right.

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:13.640
So Kot, it's a nice book
on mathematical ecology,

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.530
if you're curious.

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:23.180
The history of this is that
it was in the mid-1920s.

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.860
And there was a marine biologist
named Humberto D'Ancona.

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.550
Does anybody speak Italian?

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.550
Well, he was a marine biologist.

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.190
And he had been studying the
prevalence of different fish

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:42.080
species in fish markets, and
kind of throughout Italy.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.250
So he went to fish markets.

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:52.600
Over the course of about
R-K. For about 10 years.

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.100
Right?

00:04:53.100 --> 00:05:00.300
So kind of roughly
from 1912 to 1923.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.140
Something like that.

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:04.010
And he basically
asked, well, what

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:05.720
is the kind of the
composition of fish

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.870
being sold in all these
fish markets across Italy.

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.700
And he noticed something
that was very interesting,

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:16.060
which is that there was a
marked change in the composition

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.910
between more predatory
fish as compared

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:21.650
to more prey-like fish.

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.025
And this was associated with
something that was happening

00:05:24.025 --> 00:05:25.360
in Europe around that time.

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:30.130
World War I. OK.

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:31.610
So World War I in the middle.

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:39.120
And what he found was that
in the middle of this period

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.330
there was an increase,
and then later a decrease

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:50.601
of what he called selachians,
which is apparently

00:05:50.601 --> 00:05:53.510
a word for sharks
and shark-like fish.

00:05:57.354 --> 00:06:01.675
But for our purposes, we'll
just say they are typically

00:06:01.675 --> 00:06:02.425
kind of predators.

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:10.500
So what he saw is that
this number of selachians,

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:14.340
a function of time, kind
of went like this, right.

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:18.960
Where this was kind of
roughly World War I.

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:22.970
And he wanted to try to
understand why did this happen.

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:25.290
Why is it that war
favors predators?

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:39.700
Probably not just having to
do with the general zeitgeist

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:43.390
at the time.So it's probably a
more mechanistic explanation.

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:49.820
And luckily, Humberto was
engaged to the beautiful Luisa

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:50.320
Volterra.

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:50.819
OK.

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:56.780
Oops.

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:03.240
Engaged to Luisa Volterra.

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:09.490
So one day mid-1920s,
our hero Humberto

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:15.110
was visiting his girlfriend.

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:19.720
And he started chatting with
his future father-in-law, who

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:24.240
was Vito Volterra, and
asked him this question.

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:28.110
And luckily, Vito Volterra
was a famous mathematician.

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:29.770
So he could write
down a fancy model

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:31.728
and try to get some
insight into this question.

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:37.620
So this is a case of random
personal interaction leading

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:38.840
to something interesting.

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:42.950
That's the Volterra--
Lotka had actually

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:47.360
studied these equations
almost 15 years earlier.

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.810
First in the context of auto
catalytic kind of chemical

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:50.900
reactions and so forth.

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:53.800
But then later indeed, in the
context of population dynamics.

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:57.220
So Lotka wrote a book
in the mid-1920s.

00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:03.297
Volterra wrote an article
analyzing D'Ancona's data.

00:08:03.297 --> 00:08:05.380
And then now it's called
the Lotka-Volterra model.

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:10.300
And we'll come
back to this thing

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:13.770
about why is it that war
favors predators after we

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:15.580
get a sense of the model.

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:24.650
So what Volterra wrote
down was the following.

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.590
First of all, we should all
make sure we can figure out

00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:43.710
which one is the predator
and which one is the prey.

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:47.170
So let's think about
this for 15 seconds.

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:49.110
And then we're going to
yell it out verbally.

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.640
Is y the predator or the prey?

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.899
Ready, three, two, one.

00:09:02.899 --> 00:09:03.690
AUDIENCE: Predator.

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:04.523
PROFESSOR: Predator.

00:09:04.523 --> 00:09:05.220
All right.

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:10.610
So we have a predator
here and prey.

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:19.960
Is the total size
of the population

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:23.790
constant? i.e, is x plus
y equal to a constant?

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:25.340
Ready, yes or no.

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:25.840
Verbally.

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:28.780
Three, two, one.

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:31.260
No.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:35.520
It would be a constant
perhaps if these two terms--

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:37.711
if b were equal to d or so.

00:09:37.711 --> 00:09:38.210
No.

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:39.150
That's not even true.

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:39.930
Never mind.

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:40.430
Yeah.

00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:40.929
OK.

00:09:40.929 --> 00:09:43.810
I guess really what
I'm thinking about is

00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:46.680
this tells us about
how many predators can

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:47.670
be created from a prey.

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:49.700
But then there's also
the growth in death rate.

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:50.920
All right.

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:55.010
But even this act
of converting prey

00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:58.087
into a predator,
even on that level

00:09:58.087 --> 00:09:59.170
it's not conserved, right?

00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:01.980
And of course, vegetarians
like to point out

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:09.420
that you can create many corn
burgers for the price of making

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:10.487
a hamburger.

00:10:10.487 --> 00:10:11.320
Something like that.

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:11.820
OK.

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:15.780
Except in the case of salmon.

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:16.730
This is not true.

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:20.380
Well, all right.

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:23.000
We can analyze the
ratio of d over b

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.250
for a variety of
different newt sandwiches

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:26.410
after class, perhaps.

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:29.780
OK.

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:33.110
So this is pretty much
the simplest model

00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:34.840
you can kind of
possibly write down

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:39.140
that captures this basic
idea that when these two

00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:43.080
species interact, we're assuming
that there's this mass action

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:44.290
kind of rate.

00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:46.360
That it's just
proportional to the number

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:48.701
of the density of x and y.

00:10:48.701 --> 00:10:50.950
Now I think that in the
context of chemical reactions,

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:54.780
this is going to be true over
a huge range of densities,

00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:57.700
and perhaps almost
even rigorously true

00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:00.590
if they are just single.

00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:03.430
There's just some x and y
that bounce into each other.

00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:06.140
And at some rate
they do something.

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:09.210
Whereas I think in the
context of predator and prey,

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:12.670
this is on much
less firm footing.

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:13.510
That's OK.

00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:14.870
So it's at least the simplest
thing we can write down.

00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:16.810
And of course, then we'll
have to ask, how is it

00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:18.185
that the conclusions
of the model

00:11:18.185 --> 00:11:22.210
might vary depending on the
assumptions that go in here.

00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:25.050
One thing that we've spent a
lot of time in this class doing

00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:29.670
is trying to look at a set
of equations, and in words,

00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:32.910
be able to extract what the
assumptions were that went

00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:35.030
into writing the equation.

00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:36.690
And associated
with that, you can

00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:39.660
think about all these things
about the nondimensionalized

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:41.080
versions of these equations.

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:43.610
You'll often see the
predator/prey models written

00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:48.980
in some nondimensionalized
version, where for example, you

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:52.230
get rid of maybe the
a and maybe the c.

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:53.760
I think that in
many cases I prefer

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:56.730
to just leave these terms in
here, because that way we can

00:11:56.730 --> 00:11:59.639
immediately see what
happens if we go hunting,

00:11:59.639 --> 00:12:00.680
or if we do this or that.

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:05.110
OK.

00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:08.550
Can we try to figure
out what-- there

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:12.250
are four assumptions,
at least, that

00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:16.180
have gone into this that are
relevant and are worth saying.

00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:17.570
Can you guys help me out?

00:12:31.367 --> 00:12:31.867
Yeah.

00:12:31.867 --> 00:12:32.950
AUDIENCE: It's well-mixed.

00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:35.387
The interaction in
terms of [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:35.387 --> 00:12:35.970
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:36.469
Right.

00:12:36.469 --> 00:12:37.490
So it's well-mixed.

00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:40.730
And there's two aspects that
we might-- So one thing,

00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:44.310
it is certainly worth
saying that it's well-mixed.

00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:46.360
But associated with
that, you're going to say

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:47.760
that it's because of x times y.

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:50.120
Right?

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:50.620
Yeah.

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:53.470
I guess that's what I feel
you were about to say.

00:12:54.919 --> 00:12:57.340
AUDIENCE: I mean, I guess.

00:12:57.340 --> 00:12:58.020
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:12:58.020 --> 00:12:58.460
Right I guess.

00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:00.668
But I think we have to keep
these things a little bit

00:13:00.668 --> 00:13:05.730
separate in the
context of chemistry,

00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:08.620
those are maybe the
same statements, right?

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:10.324
Of course, we're
writing these things.

00:13:10.324 --> 00:13:12.740
These are just quantities that
are just functions of time.

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:14.670
We have not included
space explicitly.

00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:17.110
So in that sense, it's
definitely a well-mixed model.

00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:22.720
But just because we're
assuming that it's well-mixed,

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:24.834
we're not keeping track
of the state of density

00:13:24.834 --> 00:13:26.250
as a function of
position does not

00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:29.290
mean that they have to
interact with this term.

00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:32.920
And for two molecules that are
bouncing against each other,

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:34.860
then I think that is the case.

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:37.681
But we have to keep these
assumptions separate.

00:13:37.681 --> 00:13:39.722
AUDIENCE: You could imagine
a colony of bacteria,

00:13:39.722 --> 00:13:43.060
for example, where
they're all-- you can only

00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:45.530
prey on the outside.

00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:46.650
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:47.680
Necessary.

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:51.702
I guess what I would say is
that if it were not well-mixed,

00:13:51.702 --> 00:13:53.660
it could still be that
they interact like this.

00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:56.200
And you just keep track of
the predator/prey density

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:57.620
as a function of position.

00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:00.270
And they could still interact
in this way, possibly.

00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:08.370
And in particular, in the
context of Turing patterns,

00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:10.880
what we did is we
allowed these things

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:12.574
to vary as a
function of position.

00:14:12.574 --> 00:14:14.490
But then we would have
still typically written

00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:17.330
the interaction
term as x times y.

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:21.186
So it is true
we're modeling this

00:14:21.186 --> 00:14:22.310
as a well-mixed population.

00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:25.215
But I think that's
independent of this statement.

00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:30.770
Do you agree or disagree?

00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:33.660
Or?

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:35.100
AUDIENCE: But if
it's well-mixed,

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:41.340
the encounter frequency will
be proportional to [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:43.194
AUDIENCE: That's sort
of the secret, right?

00:14:43.194 --> 00:14:43.860
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:46.644
AUDIENCE: The assumption
is the encounter frequency

00:14:46.644 --> 00:14:49.124
is proportionate, right?

00:14:49.124 --> 00:14:49.790
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:50.290
OK.

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:55.020
So what I would say
is-- well, certainly

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:57.070
in the context of
predators and prey,

00:14:57.070 --> 00:14:59.940
it could be that if
the prey is full,

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:04.650
then it's not going
to be so simple.

00:15:04.650 --> 00:15:07.000
In a sense, is that I
guess it could be more

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.850
complicated than that is all.

00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:11.689
But my statement--

00:15:11.689 --> 00:15:14.022
AUDIENCE: So you're saying--
I'm sorry-- the interaction

00:15:14.022 --> 00:15:18.330
term would not necessarily be
just a function of x times y.

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:19.500
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:21.370
It could be more
complicated than that.

00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:24.030
And the other thing is that
even if it were not well-mixed,

00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:27.127
in the context of these
reaction diffusion models,

00:15:27.127 --> 00:15:29.710
we would typically say that the
rate that these two things hit

00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:30.710
each other is x times y.

00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:32.360
But they're each a
function of position.

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:32.520
Right.

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:34.680
So it's not that there's--
it can either be well-mixed

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:35.130
or not.

00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:36.505
And it can either
be this or not.

00:15:36.505 --> 00:15:38.167
I guess.

00:15:38.167 --> 00:15:40.125
AUDIENCE: But it's not
quite the same variable,

00:15:40.125 --> 00:15:43.100
because in that case it would
be the density, whereas--

00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:44.220
PROFESSOR: I agree.

00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:46.850
Although here, it's not
obvious whether we're

00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:50.220
talking about number
or density, frankly.

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:50.800
Right.

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:55.040
And we often talk about this as
if it's the number of predator,

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:55.780
number of prey.

00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:58.350
But then that's a little bit
inconsistent with this in that

00:15:58.350 --> 00:16:00.840
if you were-- this
should really be,

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:03.310
if you're thinking about
these terms being the product.

00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:06.300
And it should really
be the density.

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:09.020
And if you're looking
at the population

00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:13.547
size in some fixed area or
volume, then it doesn't matter.

00:16:13.547 --> 00:16:15.380
But even in the context
of predator or prey,

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:18.160
I'd say that the way in
which this would make senses

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:18.976
is via densities.

00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:27.560
Does this discussion make sense?

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:29.540
Maybe?

00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:32.320
We are assuming it's
well-mixed, because we're not

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:35.410
thinking about these things
as a function of position.

00:16:35.410 --> 00:16:38.590
But I would say that we
cannot get that from just

00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:41.256
the interaction term.

00:16:41.256 --> 00:16:42.922
We are assuming it's
well-mixed, though.

00:16:47.059 --> 00:16:48.600
Other things that
we've assumed here?

00:16:57.224 --> 00:16:59.182
AUDIENCE: Something along
the lines of the prey

00:16:59.182 --> 00:17:01.110
doesn't need the
predator, for instance.

00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:01.818
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:17:01.818 --> 00:17:05.119
The prey does not
need the predator.

00:17:05.119 --> 00:17:06.910
And in particular, what
happens to the prey

00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:08.140
in the absence of predator?

00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:09.819
AUDIENCE: It grows.

00:17:09.819 --> 00:17:11.660
PROFESSOR: So the prey
grows exponentially.

00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:13.493
AUDIENCE: Because it's
not diet [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:21.282
PROFESSOR: Without predator.

00:17:21.282 --> 00:17:22.990
And the other thing
that is perhaps worth

00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:26.450
mentioning in all this
though is that this

00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:29.880
is a deterministic
description of the world.

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:32.990
So a here is telling us about--
the normal way that we would

00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:37.570
interpret a is it's the rate
of division of the cells,

00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:43.350
or the rate of new deer
being born, or whatnot.

00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:44.830
But of course, a
could actually be

00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:48.074
the difference between this
growth rate and a death rate.

00:17:48.074 --> 00:17:50.240
So just because we don't
have an explicit death rate

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:52.410
doesn't mean that
there's no death.

00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:59.369
So I think you can't actually
say that the prey does not

00:17:59.369 --> 00:18:00.660
die in the absence of predator.

00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:04.920
What you can say is that
the prey population--

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:06.700
we're assuming that
a is greater than 0.

00:18:09.912 --> 00:18:12.120
So what you can say is that
the prey population grows

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:14.390
exponentially without
the predator at rate a.

00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:16.590
But this is really in
principle the difference

00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:19.940
between the growth rate and
the death rate of the prey

00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:22.590
in the absence of the predator.

00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:24.710
And in the context of a
differential equation,

00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:26.330
this doesn't make
any difference.

00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:29.157
But if we were to go and do a
master equation type formalism,

00:18:29.157 --> 00:18:30.365
would this make a difference?

00:18:32.961 --> 00:18:33.460
Yeah.

00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:33.960
Right.

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:37.615
So this is the whole thing about
the Fokker-Planck approach.

00:18:37.615 --> 00:18:41.880
And you can get different
variances at equilibrium,

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:44.880
depending on whether the rate
of forward back reactions and so

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:46.430
forth.

00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:48.983
Does that sound
familiar to you guys?

00:18:48.983 --> 00:18:49.482
No.

00:18:54.874 --> 00:18:56.540
What else have we
assumed in this model?

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:03.316
AUDIENCE: The predator
dies exponentially.

00:19:03.316 --> 00:19:04.024
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:19:04.024 --> 00:19:07.610
So the predator dies
exponentially when?

00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:12.925
So the predator dies
exponentially without the prey.

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:27.485
So it's a nice
simple assumption.

00:19:27.485 --> 00:19:29.860
Other things that you might
like to point out about this?

00:19:32.668 --> 00:19:36.547
AUDIENCE: A single
predator is [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:36.547 --> 00:19:37.130
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:37.629
Right.

00:19:37.629 --> 00:19:40.060
So there is a sense that
it's just x times y.

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:41.910
So the most simple way
to think about this

00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:45.820
is that it somehow is a single
predator eating a single prey.

00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:48.300
There's maybe no group
hunting type behavior.

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:52.530
So if we wanted to try to
understand how a pack of wolves

00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:55.290
can bring down a
buffalo, then you

00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:59.700
might not want to
use this equation.

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:03.870
So this is that the
rate of predation

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:12.930
is proportional-- we'll
say goes as x times y.

00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:18.720
And that embodies many
different kinds of assumptions.

00:20:29.371 --> 00:20:30.370
These are four findings.

00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:42.560
OK.

00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:45.440
So since it's such a simple
model, we can go ahead

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:46.630
and we can just solve it.

00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:47.130
Right.

00:20:49.670 --> 00:20:51.790
How many fixed points
are there going to be?

00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:06.620
Two.

00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:08.100
OK.

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:09.880
It's always good to
remember these things.

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:13.156
And so what we can
think about, this as x.

00:21:13.156 --> 00:21:16.050
This is y.

00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:18.610
There's indeed going to be a
fixed point somewhere in here.

00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:21.860
But then the other one is
going to be at zero, zero.

00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:24.022
Because the top equation
has x's everywhere.

00:21:24.022 --> 00:21:25.480
Bottom equation
has y's everywhere.

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:28.960
So indeed, there's going to be
one fixed point at zero,zero.

00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:34.770
So-called the
trivial fixed point.

00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:41.760
Is this a stable, or is this
an unstable fixed point?

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:43.260
Let's think about
this for a moment.

00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:46.270
And then we'll vote verbally.

00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:48.160
Stable or unstable?

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:48.660
OK.

00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:51.560
Ready, three, two, one.

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:52.846
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:52.846 --> 00:21:55.220
PROFESSOR: So I think there
were some disagreements there

00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:57.620
probably.

00:21:57.620 --> 00:22:02.040
It was a little hard to
tell from the verbal.

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:04.670
And one way that we can
think about this as that we

00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:08.150
can ask, well, the predator in
the absence of the prey, what

00:22:08.150 --> 00:22:10.110
happens to it?

00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:14.290
So it kind of comes down here.

00:22:14.290 --> 00:22:17.550
So along this axis it's stable.

00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:20.060
However, in the
absence of predator,

00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:22.460
if you think about the
prey, that'll grow.

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:29.620
So this is actually an
unstable fixed point.

00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:33.471
Stable along one axis and
unstable on the other.

00:22:33.471 --> 00:22:34.970
Incidentally, what
does this tell us

00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:41.379
about the eigenvectors
around this fixed point?

00:22:41.379 --> 00:22:42.990
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:43.990
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:47.275
The eigenvectors are
really just 0, 1, 1, 0.

00:22:47.275 --> 00:22:49.650
Because you can see that if
you start along one of these,

00:22:49.650 --> 00:22:50.360
you come straight down.

00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:52.443
Start along the other one,
you come straight down.

00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:59.930
And the other one we
can just see by-- well,

00:22:59.930 --> 00:23:02.160
we can solve it directly.

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:03.630
Just we pull out an x.

00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:07.000
It's when a minus
by is equal to zero.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:13.610
And also when minus c
plus dx is equal to zero.

00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:18.790
So the other fixed point,
this x star, y star, and this

00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:20.720
is maybe the important one.

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:28.960
It's going to be just
c over d and a over b.

00:23:36.130 --> 00:23:37.410
Super simple model.

00:23:37.410 --> 00:23:38.000
Right?

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.340
You can calculate
where the fixed

00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:42.630
points are kind of immediately.

00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:46.670
But it's actually a model that
has many weird properties.

00:23:46.670 --> 00:23:50.640
Some of which you might
think of as features.

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:52.660
Some of which you
might think of as bugs.

00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:58.800
But in particular, the location
of this fixed point, I think,

00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:05.720
is really sort of surprising
in that its dependence on this

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:07.010
abcd.

00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:09.100
This is part of
why I really think

00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:12.790
that when analyzing this
model, I very much prefer

00:24:12.790 --> 00:24:15.450
to keep the a's, b's, c's,
d's, rather than using

00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:17.200
the nondimensionalized
version of it.

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:21.160
Because when you do that, you
lose track of what's going on.

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:25.230
So this model for example,
makes very clear predictions

00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:29.180
of what should happen if
you hunt the predator.

00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:43.920
There are various contexts
in which wildlife managers

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:50.260
have been interested in trying
to help a prey population.

00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:52.660
So if a prey population
is suffering in some way,

00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:56.810
then you can reasonably think
what you should want to do

00:24:56.810 --> 00:25:00.940
is kill the predator.

00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:04.850
And this is all these debates
where you have the wildlife

00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:09.480
managers, where they buy
automatic rifles in order

00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:12.010
to shoot wolves
from helicopters.

00:25:12.010 --> 00:25:14.970
We have a Canadian
in the room, right?

00:25:14.970 --> 00:25:17.454
I mean, wasn't this
a Canadian proposal?

00:25:17.454 --> 00:25:18.620
AUDIENCE: I'm very American.

00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:19.785
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:25:19.785 --> 00:25:24.020
We'll have to do some more
research to figure out exactly.

00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:24.520
OK.

00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:25.810
Right.

00:25:25.810 --> 00:25:28.680
So the question is, well, what
happens at least in this model?

00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:31.020
And people apparently
have seen this sort

00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:34.650
of thing occurring in natural
populations as well, right?

00:25:34.650 --> 00:25:41.870
If you hunt the predator by
going out and shooting them,

00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:44.580
what does this do to the
predator and the prey

00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:46.440
populations.

00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:56.130
In particular, we think
about x star, y star.

00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:33.345
Well maybe this-- am I confused?

00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:43.590
Maybe this is the example
that I'm confused by.

00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:46.270
Well we have to complete
it now that I started it.

00:26:46.270 --> 00:26:48.390
But now I might
have gone backwards.

00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:53.660
We'll see what happens,
and then discuss.

00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:54.160
All right.

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:55.100
Ready.

00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:57.564
Three-- Oh wait.

00:26:57.564 --> 00:26:58.730
I don't have enough options.

00:26:58.730 --> 00:26:59.320
OK.

00:26:59.320 --> 00:26:59.820
Sorry.

00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:02.440
We should do one,
then the other.

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:04.690
Because sometimes things
don't change, right?

00:27:04.690 --> 00:27:08.535
So how do I do this?

00:27:08.535 --> 00:27:09.320
OK.

00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:09.820
Sorry.

00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:10.320
OK.

00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:12.380
We should just do one,
then the other, right?

00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:22.070
No change.

00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:23.810
This is down.

00:27:23.810 --> 00:27:24.310
OK.

00:27:27.995 --> 00:27:29.620
There's gonna be a
problem [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:36.490 --> 00:27:37.610
Let's first do y star.

00:27:37.610 --> 00:27:40.320
Cause that's the
most direct one.

00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:40.820
Sorry.

00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:42.830
I think that my story
I got backwards.

00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:43.914
But we'll figure this out.

00:27:43.914 --> 00:27:44.413
OK.

00:27:44.413 --> 00:27:44.930
Ready?

00:27:44.930 --> 00:27:45.430
OK.

00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:48.080
So the question is,
there's a population

00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:49.300
that you want to-- all right.

00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:51.540
Now I'm going to redo
my story to make it--

00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:55.640
but there's a population you
want to keep in check somehow.

00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:58.000
So you might reasonably
go out and shoot it.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.355
Right?

00:27:59.355 --> 00:28:00.730
So the question
is, if you go out

00:28:00.730 --> 00:28:03.400
and you do this on
the predator, at least

00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:05.670
in this model, what happens?

00:28:05.670 --> 00:28:06.170
All right.

00:28:06.170 --> 00:28:06.740
Ready.

00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:08.940
Three, two, one.

00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:09.690
Right.

00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:12.739
So although we actually
have a fair number

00:28:12.739 --> 00:28:13.780
of disagreements on this.

00:28:19.690 --> 00:28:21.810
So we're actually kind
of 50-50 at this stage.

00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:28.280
What is it if you go out
and from the helicopter,

00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:30.470
you start shooting
this animal, what

00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:34.570
does that do from the
standpoint of this model?

00:28:34.570 --> 00:28:35.070
Right.

00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:37.260
So we're shooting the predator.

00:28:40.170 --> 00:28:41.720
a, b, c, d, what you think?

00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:43.601
What should it change?

00:28:43.601 --> 00:28:44.100
c.

00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:46.330
And does c go up or go down?

00:28:46.330 --> 00:28:47.320
C goes up.

00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:48.010
OK.

00:28:48.010 --> 00:28:50.255
Well, how does
that affect y star?

00:28:50.255 --> 00:28:51.130
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:55.034 --> 00:28:56.010
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:28:56.010 --> 00:28:56.885
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:00.694 --> 00:29:01.360
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:01.860
Right.

00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:04.550
You know, I mean, I'm thinking
daily helicopter rides

00:29:04.550 --> 00:29:08.185
where you shoot wolves
as you see them.

00:29:08.185 --> 00:29:09.226
AUDIENCE: This is Canada.

00:29:09.226 --> 00:29:10.309
PROFESSOR: This is Canada.

00:29:10.309 --> 00:29:11.090
This is Canada.

00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:13.782
Yeah, those Canadians.

00:29:13.782 --> 00:29:16.973
AUDIENCE: So effectively,
you're changing the death rate

00:29:16.973 --> 00:29:18.265
of-- that's what you're saying.

00:29:18.265 --> 00:29:19.098
PROFESSOR: Well, OK.

00:29:19.098 --> 00:29:19.900
So that's my claim.

00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:23.330
Of course, all of these things
can be more complicated.

00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:27.470
But it certainly is
change in the death rate

00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:30.580
when you go and shoot them.

00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:32.330
So I guess I would say
that in the context

00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:34.705
of this model, that's the
simplest way to think about it.

00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:42.397
So the statement is that
if you hunt this predator,

00:29:42.397 --> 00:29:44.480
you're increasing the death
rate for the predator.

00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:46.410
You're increasing c.

00:29:46.410 --> 00:29:47.950
Hunting predator.

00:29:47.950 --> 00:29:50.960
This causes c to go up.

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:54.120
And the striking thing is
that y star does not change.

00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:54.620
OK.

00:29:58.092 --> 00:30:00.076
AUDIENCE: I believe you.

00:30:00.076 --> 00:30:01.467
I think it's funny.

00:30:01.467 --> 00:30:02.050
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:03.156
[LAUGHS] You believe me.

00:30:03.156 --> 00:30:04.279
OK, I'm glad.

00:30:04.279 --> 00:30:06.570
One thing is believing me in
the context of this model.

00:30:06.570 --> 00:30:09.780
Another thing is asking whether
this is happening in real life.

00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:12.460
But I think people have
seen such weird phenomenon

00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:13.416
in the context.

00:30:13.416 --> 00:30:14.790
But then of course,
it's a matter

00:30:14.790 --> 00:30:17.020
of is this a dominant source?

00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:17.740
What's going on?

00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:19.080
Like many, many things.

00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:19.881
Right.

00:30:19.881 --> 00:30:21.380
But certainly in
this model, there's

00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:27.130
this weird phenomenon where
the death rate of the predator

00:30:27.130 --> 00:30:32.360
does not alter this y star.

00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:32.860
OK.

00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:35.401
We have to figure out what the
y star means here in a moment.

00:30:38.290 --> 00:30:44.360
What is the effect on
this fixed point number

00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:47.810
concentration of the prey?

00:30:47.810 --> 00:30:49.030
It goes up.

00:30:49.030 --> 00:30:52.420
So my original story, I
think I was getting confused.

00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:54.180
So at least in
this model there's

00:30:54.180 --> 00:30:56.660
a sense that if you
hunt the predator,

00:30:56.660 --> 00:31:00.210
it's true that you don't
bring down the steady state,

00:31:00.210 --> 00:31:03.600
or the time average-- we'll
see-- time averaged number

00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:05.300
of the predator population.

00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:08.190
But you do increase
the prey population.

00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:10.277
Because in this case
you can help the prey.

00:31:10.277 --> 00:31:11.860
But you don't bring
down the predator.

00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:18.790
Now I want to say something
more about justifying

00:31:18.790 --> 00:31:21.370
this thing about why we might
care about x star and y star

00:31:21.370 --> 00:31:22.870
so much.

00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:24.460
So this thing is x star/y star.

00:31:27.374 --> 00:31:28.040
Well, maybe all.

00:31:34.771 --> 00:31:35.270
Yes.

00:31:35.270 --> 00:31:37.735
AUDIENCE: As soon as
you stop shooting,

00:31:37.735 --> 00:31:40.693
this is a very
temporary solution.

00:31:40.693 --> 00:31:43.170
When you stop shooting, c goes
back to its original value.

00:31:43.170 --> 00:31:44.220
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:46.120
When you stop
shooting, c goes back

00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:48.290
to its original model,
or original value.

00:31:48.290 --> 00:31:51.020
And then the prey population
will come back down.

00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:53.020
So this is something you
have to continue to do.

00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:02.190
Yes.

00:32:02.190 --> 00:32:06.440
What do I wanna say?

00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:09.070
If you go ahead
and you calculate

00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:14.170
the-- if we linearize around
this fixed point x star/y

00:32:14.170 --> 00:32:17.240
star, that's our standard
thing that we did early

00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:21.920
on the semester, what we
find is that this Jacobian,

00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:27.000
this matrix A, the linearized
matrix you get is-- all right.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.650
Well, we come here and we take
the derivative with respect

00:32:30.650 --> 00:32:31.310
to x.

00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:32.485
So we get a minus by.

00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:39.000
Derivative of this guy
up top with respect to y.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.440
And we get minus bx.

00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:47.900
And derivative of this g
function with respect to x.

00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:50.520
We get dy.

00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:55.810
Now aspect to y, we
have a minus c plus dx.

00:32:55.810 --> 00:32:59.870
Now we want to evaluate
this around that fixed point

00:32:59.870 --> 00:33:07.410
at x star/y star,
which is given here.

00:33:07.410 --> 00:33:09.920
We plug this in.

00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:11.220
So evaluate at y star.

00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:13.845
It's a over b 0.

00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:19.770
Evaluate at x star.

00:33:19.770 --> 00:33:22.280
This is just minus bc over d.

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:29.960
Now y star, this is ab over b.

00:33:33.770 --> 00:33:35.410
And here we can get 0.

00:33:38.210 --> 00:33:42.510
So this is telling us about
the linearized dynamics

00:33:42.510 --> 00:33:44.550
around a fixed
point x star/y star.

00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:52.315
Now for this sort of matrix,
what are the eigenvalues?

00:33:58.642 --> 00:34:01.660
It's not that the
eigenvalues are 0.

00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:04.400
It's a slightly
different statement.

00:34:44.679 --> 00:34:48.989
What are the eigenvalues
for a matrix like this?

00:34:48.989 --> 00:34:49.620
What's that?

00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:50.800
AUDIENCE: They're imaginary.

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:51.508
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:34:51.508 --> 00:34:53.610
They're purely imaginary.

00:34:53.610 --> 00:34:56.040
So the real part
is equal to zero.

00:34:56.040 --> 00:34:58.309
So indeed, we can
figure out this.

00:34:58.309 --> 00:35:00.600
Cause remember, to figure
out what the eigenvalues are,

00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:04.500
you take the determinant
of this vector

00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:08.015
a minus this lambda times
the identity matrix.

00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:14.610
So we end up with, we want to
take the determinant of-- we

00:35:14.610 --> 00:35:18.140
have a minus lambda,
a minus lambda,

00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:19.530
and then minus bc over d.

00:35:29.367 --> 00:35:30.325
This is lambda squared.

00:35:33.970 --> 00:35:40.750
And then this is a plus, we
have bc over d, ab over b.

00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:51.020
So we end up that
the eigenvalues

00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:54.273
are equal to plus minus
square root of a times ci.

00:35:57.570 --> 00:36:00.585
So they're purely
imaginary eigenvalues.

00:36:07.711 --> 00:36:08.960
And what does this mean again?

00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:28.520
What can you say when you
do this sort of analysis

00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:30.270
and you have purely
imaginary eigenvalues?

00:36:37.136 --> 00:36:39.432
AUDIENCE: The orbits look
like ellipses or something

00:36:39.432 --> 00:36:41.272
like that.

00:36:41.272 --> 00:36:41.980
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:44.130
So the statement is that-- OK.

00:36:44.130 --> 00:36:47.310
And then we have to be careful
in all of this business.

00:36:47.310 --> 00:36:49.210
So what we've done
is we've taken

00:36:49.210 --> 00:36:51.770
a set of non-linear, a pair
of non-linear differential

00:36:51.770 --> 00:36:52.340
equations.

00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:56.000
We've done the linear
stability analysis.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.080
And we get purely imaginary.

00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:00.290
So one thing that you can
say is that if you started

00:37:00.290 --> 00:37:02.770
with a linear
system, and you got

00:37:02.770 --> 00:37:05.420
purely imaginary eigenvalues,
that would tell you

00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:08.860
that indeed, you have these
neutrally stable orbits,

00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:10.710
they go around.

00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:14.940
They can have a variety
of different shapes.

00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:17.832
But given that the order
that we did things in

00:37:17.832 --> 00:37:19.290
is that we took a
nonlinear system,

00:37:19.290 --> 00:37:21.697
and we linearized,
and then got this.

00:37:21.697 --> 00:37:23.030
What does that allow you to say?

00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:34.200
Does that prove
that you actually

00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:39.410
have these neutrally
stable [INAUDIBLE]?

00:37:39.410 --> 00:37:40.520
Yeah.

00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:43.120
Because this is one
of those border cases,

00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:45.370
it unfortunately
does not actually

00:37:45.370 --> 00:37:48.040
allow you to say that you
have neutrally stable orbits.

00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:52.250
Because it turns out that
the slight nonlinearities

00:37:52.250 --> 00:37:55.330
in the equations
could cause problems,

00:37:55.330 --> 00:37:58.580
and cause it to go either
to a stable limit cycle

00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:01.570
or to a stable spiral.

00:38:01.570 --> 00:38:03.790
The confusing thing
is that in this case

00:38:03.790 --> 00:38:08.140
it is true that you have
neutrally stable orbits.

00:38:08.140 --> 00:38:10.410
But that did not
have to be true.

00:38:10.410 --> 00:38:15.010
And guys will get the chance
to do this proof and so forth.

00:38:15.010 --> 00:38:17.625
Because there some
conserved quantities.

00:38:17.625 --> 00:38:20.000
Of course, people have analyzed
this thing in more depth.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.550
And it is true that you have
neutrally stable orbits.

00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:24.820
But what is very
hard to remember

00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:27.320
is that it didn't have
to be the case just based

00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:29.910
on what we've said so far.

00:38:29.910 --> 00:38:30.410
Yeah.

00:38:30.410 --> 00:38:32.535
AUDIENCE: So you mentioned,
it's not a coincidence.

00:38:32.535 --> 00:38:35.180
There is a deeper reason why?

00:38:35.180 --> 00:38:36.522
PROFESSOR: Well, coincidence.

00:38:36.522 --> 00:38:37.980
I guess what I'm
saying is that you

00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:40.700
can prove that this
thing does have

00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:43.860
these neutrally stable orbits.

00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:46.090
But we have not proven that.

00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:47.382
And we're not going to.

00:38:50.590 --> 00:38:55.180
Do these orbits go around
clockwise or counterclockwise?

00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:55.680
Ready.

00:38:55.680 --> 00:39:00.475
Three, two, one.

00:39:00.475 --> 00:39:01.600
AUDIENCE: Counterclockwise.

00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:02.700
PROFESSOR: Counterclockwise.

00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:03.199
Right.

00:39:03.199 --> 00:39:06.554
And you can get that
from thinking about what

00:39:06.554 --> 00:39:07.720
predator and prey should do.

00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:09.916
But also I've already
drawn some arrows here.

00:39:09.916 --> 00:39:11.790
And that kind of helps
provide some guidance.

00:39:15.370 --> 00:39:17.980
So they kind of come
around like this.

00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:23.360
Now is this the only orbit
that I should be drawing here?

00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:24.280
No.

00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:24.990
Right.

00:39:24.990 --> 00:39:28.120
Because it turns out
that in this case

00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:30.670
there are an
infinitely large number

00:39:30.670 --> 00:39:34.238
of orbits that could
possibly come around.

00:39:39.451 --> 00:39:39.950
Yes.

00:39:39.950 --> 00:39:40.825
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:45.020
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:39:45.020 --> 00:39:48.157
Well, in the context
of our simulation,

00:39:48.157 --> 00:39:50.240
the simplest thing that
you guys would probably do

00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:52.300
is you would simulate and
see what comes around.

00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:54.290
But yeah.

00:39:54.290 --> 00:39:56.767
I think even in the
reading, did they prove it?

00:39:56.767 --> 00:39:59.350
Different authors in different
books either prove it or don't.

00:39:59.350 --> 00:40:02.040
And there are a
number of different--

00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:03.930
you'll see in the
problems, you can

00:40:03.930 --> 00:40:08.440
find that there is a
quantity that is conserved

00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:09.870
along the equations of motion.

00:40:15.020 --> 00:40:17.821
But the quantity's different
for each of these orbits.

00:40:17.821 --> 00:40:18.320
Right.

00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:19.820
So it's really saying
that as you go,

00:40:19.820 --> 00:40:21.236
there's some
quantities conserved.

00:40:21.236 --> 00:40:23.980
And it still has the same
value when you go around.

00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:25.896
And so that means you
had to kind of come back

00:40:25.896 --> 00:40:28.040
to where you were.

00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:31.077
So there is a
conserved quantity.

00:40:31.077 --> 00:40:31.660
You'll see it.

00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:40.230
Now these neutrally
stable orbits

00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:42.170
are kind of funny
in several ways.

00:40:54.180 --> 00:40:57.470
Well, first of all,
this eigenvalue

00:40:57.470 --> 00:41:00.740
tells you about the
period of the orbits

00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:02.420
when you're close
to the fixed point.

00:41:05.917 --> 00:41:07.500
And you can see that
it doesn't depend

00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:08.625
on everything in the model.

00:41:08.625 --> 00:41:11.530
It depends on a and c.

00:41:11.530 --> 00:41:13.110
Does that kind of
make sense, maybe?

00:41:17.420 --> 00:41:17.920
Yeah.

00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:18.580
Sort of.

00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:22.270
Cause a is telling us about
how rapidly we grow up here.

00:41:22.270 --> 00:41:25.190
c is talking about how
rapidly we die over here.

00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:27.930
So you know, it has
something that at least

00:41:27.930 --> 00:41:30.850
has units of 1 over time.

00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:36.560
It makes sense that a
and c should appear here.

00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:40.669
But I would submit that it's
not totally obvious that b

00:41:40.669 --> 00:41:41.960
and d should not appear at all.

00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:51.230
So neutrally stable
orbits, there's

00:41:51.230 --> 00:42:04.000
no characteristic amplitude to
the oscillations, nor period.

00:42:07.410 --> 00:42:11.580
And this is at least true
far from the fixed point.

00:42:11.580 --> 00:42:13.986
This tells you about
maybe these orbits.

00:42:13.986 --> 00:42:16.360
But then it doesn't tell you
about what happens far away.

00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:23.110
And these are not the
kind of oscillations

00:42:23.110 --> 00:42:25.230
that from a
mathematical standpoint

00:42:25.230 --> 00:42:28.000
we like the most,
which are limit cycles.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:33.810
And remember, a limit
cycle would look like this.

00:42:33.810 --> 00:42:35.450
If it were a limit
cycle, it would

00:42:35.450 --> 00:42:39.390
be that there's some orbit
that is stable in the sense

00:42:39.390 --> 00:42:41.810
that if you start
inside of it, then

00:42:41.810 --> 00:42:43.450
you would approach it over time.

00:42:43.450 --> 00:42:45.117
If you start outside
of it, then again,

00:42:45.117 --> 00:42:46.450
you would approach it over time.

00:42:50.070 --> 00:42:54.670
And this orbit then would have
a characteristic amplitude,

00:42:54.670 --> 00:42:59.909
and a characteristic period,
because it's one orbit.

00:42:59.909 --> 00:43:01.950
Whereas here, this has
kind of an infinite number

00:43:01.950 --> 00:43:03.039
of different orbits.

00:43:03.039 --> 00:43:04.580
What this means is
that just any sort

00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:07.180
of noise-- demographic
fluctuations and so forth--

00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:10.010
would cause the system to
drift over time in terms

00:43:10.010 --> 00:43:13.044
of this amplitude of period.

00:43:13.044 --> 00:43:14.919
So it's true that if
you got it started

00:43:14.919 --> 00:43:16.460
in the absence of
any noise, it would

00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:19.750
keep on doing that oscillation
forever with that amplitude.

00:43:19.750 --> 00:43:23.220
But any random noise will
cause the thing to drift.

00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:38.295
The other thing that
is worth stressing

00:43:38.295 --> 00:43:42.110
in this is that if you do a
time average of the predator

00:43:42.110 --> 00:43:45.890
concentration, or the
prey concentration,

00:43:45.890 --> 00:43:57.820
so if you do the average or the
mean, x as a function of time,

00:43:57.820 --> 00:44:03.910
or y is a function of time
is indeed x star y star.

00:44:03.910 --> 00:44:07.180
That's also something
that you'd have to show.

00:44:07.180 --> 00:44:09.120
Not at all obvious from this.

00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:11.840
It's not a surprise for these
orbits that are out here that

00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:13.620
the time average is
indeed x star /y star.

00:44:13.620 --> 00:44:17.380
But for these big orbits,
they probably already

00:44:17.380 --> 00:44:19.050
didn't have to be.

00:44:19.050 --> 00:44:21.666
So this is telling us that the
analysis that we were talking

00:44:21.666 --> 00:44:23.040
about-- well, what
happens if you

00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:26.990
do one thing or another
thing-- that's actually

00:44:26.990 --> 00:44:30.360
kind of a reasonable quantity
to be trying to calculate,

00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:34.760
because that is the
average or the mean number

00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:36.140
of predator/prey in this model.

00:44:38.740 --> 00:44:39.560
Yes.

00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:42.440
AUDIENCE: So in a
zombie apocalypse,

00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:45.330
how do we thin down
the zombie [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:45.330 --> 00:44:46.060
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:44:46.060 --> 00:44:47.550
That's a very
important question.

00:44:47.550 --> 00:44:50.610
In the event of a
zombie apocalypse,

00:44:50.610 --> 00:44:53.400
what do we have to do
in order to thin out

00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:54.810
the zombie population?

00:44:54.810 --> 00:44:55.310
All right.

00:44:55.310 --> 00:44:58.676
Well, the zombie
movies typically

00:44:58.676 --> 00:44:59.800
are not yet at equilibrium.

00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:07.520
But certainly at equilibrium,
what do you want to do?

00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:14.160
This is not a formal
recommendation, by the way.

00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:16.770
But in this model, if
you want to decrease

00:45:16.770 --> 00:45:21.576
the number of the predator,
what is it that we want to do?

00:45:27.810 --> 00:45:28.310
Right.

00:45:28.310 --> 00:45:28.840
Well, OK.

00:45:28.840 --> 00:45:31.690
So in this model, if
you want to decrease

00:45:31.690 --> 00:45:34.000
the number of the
zombies at equilibrium,

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:41.124
you want to decrease a,
which corresponds to--

00:45:41.124 --> 00:45:42.576
AUDIENCE: So it's
a is equal to 0.

00:45:42.576 --> 00:45:44.512
So the birth rate is
equal to the death rate,

00:45:44.512 --> 00:45:46.944
then there aren't new zombies.

00:45:46.944 --> 00:45:47.610
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:45:47.610 --> 00:45:49.020
There are probably
also no people.

00:45:49.020 --> 00:45:50.020
AUDIENCE: But there are.

00:45:50.020 --> 00:45:51.699
The birth rate is
equal to the-- so you

00:45:51.699 --> 00:45:52.810
have a stable population.

00:45:52.810 --> 00:45:53.518
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:45:53.518 --> 00:45:55.190
So in the limit, as
a goes to 0, it's

00:45:55.190 --> 00:45:57.280
true that the number
of zombies goes to 0.

00:46:00.208 --> 00:46:02.605
AUDIENCE: So you just
have to beat [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:02.605 --> 00:46:03.230
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:08.270
This is a good
situation where it's

00:46:08.270 --> 00:46:10.770
important to ask about whether
your assumptions in the model

00:46:10.770 --> 00:46:14.811
are good before making
public policy based on them.

00:46:14.811 --> 00:46:16.901
OK?

00:46:16.901 --> 00:46:17.400
Indeed.

00:46:22.410 --> 00:46:24.260
But can we go back
just for a moment

00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:28.165
before we switch gears, to
ask about this question of why

00:46:28.165 --> 00:46:36.270
it was that war might have
favored these predator fish?

00:46:36.270 --> 00:46:38.730
And by favored, what
he really measured,

00:46:38.730 --> 00:46:40.920
he measured the number
of the frequency

00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:44.590
of these kind of predator
fish at the markets.

00:46:44.590 --> 00:46:48.940
So it's somehow is maybe the
ratio of those two, or so.

00:47:00.170 --> 00:47:01.010
Yeah.

00:47:01.010 --> 00:47:01.580
That's right.

00:47:04.350 --> 00:47:09.700
Yes, it could that the
fisherman just-- yeah.

00:47:09.700 --> 00:47:12.070
So they could have fished
in a different region.

00:47:12.070 --> 00:47:14.861
And so the explanation
could be something--

00:47:14.861 --> 00:47:16.860
AUDIENCE: Because it's
not very well controlled.

00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:18.100
PROFESSOR: It's not a
controlled experiment.

00:47:18.100 --> 00:47:20.590
That's why you need to have
many different wars in order

00:47:20.590 --> 00:47:23.175
to average the
importance of large data.

00:47:27.860 --> 00:47:31.182
AUDIENCE: That's going to
be a great [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:31.182 --> 00:47:31.890
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:47:31.890 --> 00:47:33.556
And then of course,
in all this business

00:47:33.556 --> 00:47:36.500
you have to ask, well, which
thing are you varying more

00:47:36.500 --> 00:47:39.010
or less, et cetera, et cetera.

00:47:39.010 --> 00:47:41.340
But let's say that
to first order,

00:47:41.340 --> 00:47:42.715
the fishermen are
going out there

00:47:42.715 --> 00:47:44.298
and they're just
catching all the fish

00:47:44.298 --> 00:47:45.350
in an unbiased fashion.

00:47:45.350 --> 00:47:47.650
But the war is making it
more difficult to fish.

00:47:47.650 --> 00:47:49.610
So not as many fishermen go out.

00:47:49.610 --> 00:47:53.025
And then what does that
do to these parameters?

00:47:55.811 --> 00:47:56.310
Right.

00:47:56.310 --> 00:47:58.420
So it might increase a,
because the prey are not

00:47:58.420 --> 00:47:59.970
getting caught as much.

00:47:59.970 --> 00:48:02.060
And it might do something
also to the predator.

00:48:02.060 --> 00:48:02.560
What?

00:48:10.329 --> 00:48:12.120
So the predator fish
are also being caught,

00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:14.120
cause they're showing
up at the market.

00:48:14.120 --> 00:48:15.620
Right.

00:48:15.620 --> 00:48:21.415
So which other parameters
does it change?

00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:26.625
So what's that?

00:48:26.625 --> 00:48:27.810
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:27.810 --> 00:48:27.950
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:48:27.950 --> 00:48:28.890
So lets be clear.

00:48:28.890 --> 00:48:36.080
It's a war makes a go down.

00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:36.580
All right.

00:48:40.190 --> 00:48:42.480
And what other
parameter might change?

00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:46.767
AUDIENCE: Fewer fishermen.

00:48:46.767 --> 00:48:47.350
PROFESSOR: Oh.

00:48:47.350 --> 00:48:47.850
I'm sorry.

00:48:47.850 --> 00:48:49.729
I'm sorry.

00:48:49.729 --> 00:48:50.270
You're right.

00:48:50.270 --> 00:48:50.930
You're right.

00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:55.660
I was starting to think
about the next one.

00:48:55.660 --> 00:48:56.160
OK.

00:48:56.160 --> 00:48:57.270
So a goes up.

00:48:57.270 --> 00:49:00.110
And what also happens?

00:49:00.110 --> 00:49:00.960
And c goes down.

00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:05.720
And this is just because a is a
growth rate. c is a death rate.

00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:09.750
So it's not that the
fishermen are preferentially

00:49:09.750 --> 00:49:12.095
changing what they're
doing between the prey

00:49:12.095 --> 00:49:15.079
fish and the predator
fish, but it's

00:49:15.079 --> 00:49:16.870
just that these are
defined different ways.

00:49:16.870 --> 00:49:17.720
Right?

00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:21.880
And in particular, what this
means is that in times of war,

00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:24.490
Voltaire's argument to
his future son-in-law

00:49:24.490 --> 00:49:29.130
was that what you expect is that
the predator population should

00:49:29.130 --> 00:49:30.550
go up.

00:49:30.550 --> 00:49:32.700
And the prey population
should go down.

00:49:32.700 --> 00:49:35.070
So the ratio of them
should certainly

00:49:35.070 --> 00:49:37.859
shift in favor of the predator.

00:49:37.859 --> 00:49:39.400
Or maybe it's just
that the fishermen

00:49:39.400 --> 00:49:42.280
didn't go into the deep
regions of water or something,

00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:44.980
where predator fish
like to hang out.

00:49:44.980 --> 00:49:48.370
But it's striking at least
that a simple model like this

00:49:48.370 --> 00:49:51.380
can actually provide
some insight.

00:50:00.510 --> 00:50:02.682
Any questions about
where we are before we

00:50:02.682 --> 00:50:03.890
modify the model in some way?

00:50:15.270 --> 00:50:18.220
Now, the problem
with this model is

00:50:18.220 --> 00:50:19.850
that it's making
lots of assumptions

00:50:19.850 --> 00:50:23.430
that we very much
think are not true.

00:50:23.430 --> 00:50:26.910
So we have a few of the
assumptions up there.

00:50:30.672 --> 00:50:32.130
Which ones are you
guys least happy

00:50:32.130 --> 00:50:35.310
about among those assumptions?

00:50:38.181 --> 00:50:38.680
Yeah.

00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:41.020
The second one, the prey
grows exponentially,

00:50:41.020 --> 00:50:42.220
i.e., without bound.

00:50:44.790 --> 00:50:46.210
That's not physical.

00:50:46.210 --> 00:50:47.540
We should fix that.

00:50:47.540 --> 00:50:49.330
So let's go ahead and do that.

00:50:49.330 --> 00:50:49.910
All right.

00:50:49.910 --> 00:50:57.581
So real prey populations-- and
all populations-- populations

00:50:57.581 --> 00:50:59.450
saturate.

00:50:59.450 --> 00:51:02.540
Don't go to infinity, right.

00:51:07.150 --> 00:51:10.540
We can just make a quick
little fix to our model

00:51:10.540 --> 00:51:11.770
to capture this, right?

00:51:11.770 --> 00:51:12.780
X dot.

00:51:12.780 --> 00:51:16.160
So now it's going to be this ax.

00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:19.930
But what we can do is we can
add a logistic term here.

00:51:23.130 --> 00:51:24.880
And we can leave
everything else constant.

00:51:34.170 --> 00:51:36.590
So we just add this
logistic row term.

00:51:36.590 --> 00:51:40.180
So now in the absence
of a predator, what

00:51:40.180 --> 00:51:42.670
will happen is that the
prey population saturates

00:51:42.670 --> 00:51:46.690
at some point, at some value k.

00:51:46.690 --> 00:51:48.430
Right?

00:51:48.430 --> 00:51:50.490
And k could be rather
large, if you like.

00:51:53.610 --> 00:51:56.604
And I think this is
the kind of situation

00:51:56.604 --> 00:51:58.020
where you say, oh
well, that could

00:51:58.020 --> 00:52:00.060
be just a really modest change.

00:52:00.060 --> 00:52:02.110
Because it's primarily
telling us about what

00:52:02.110 --> 00:52:04.310
happens kind of in the
absence of the predator.

00:52:04.310 --> 00:52:10.400
But really, the dynamics
around here could be unchanged.

00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:12.270
But what's striking
is that because

00:52:12.270 --> 00:52:14.860
of this neutral
stability of the model,

00:52:14.860 --> 00:52:19.110
any little change can lead
to a qualitative change

00:52:19.110 --> 00:52:20.540
in the outcome at equilibrium.

00:52:20.540 --> 00:52:23.280
And in particular, adding
a carrying capacity

00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:28.830
causes the sustained
oscillations to disappear.

00:52:28.830 --> 00:52:30.365
Instead you get
damped oscillations.

00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:38.090
So in this case, xy, you
still have this fixed point.

00:52:38.090 --> 00:52:44.790
But what happens is that you
get-- it orbits the look.

00:52:44.790 --> 00:52:46.700
Kind of like this.

00:52:46.700 --> 00:52:47.220
Yes.

00:52:47.220 --> 00:52:48.136
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:50.769 --> 00:52:51.560
PROFESSOR: Yeah OK.

00:52:51.560 --> 00:52:54.870
So that depends
upon [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:54.870 --> 00:52:58.590
And indeed, as k
goes to infinity,

00:52:58.590 --> 00:53:02.616
the timescale of this decay
goes to infinity as well.

00:53:02.616 --> 00:53:07.250
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
clean scaling.

00:53:07.250 --> 00:53:08.984
PROFESSOR: A clean scaling.

00:53:08.984 --> 00:53:10.567
AUDIENCE: But I mean
just [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:13.075 --> 00:53:18.820
PROFESSOR: I mean, I don't have
nothing intelligent to say.

00:53:18.820 --> 00:53:23.970
But what I can say is
that if you put in a k

00:53:23.970 --> 00:53:27.650
at values that are close
to this fixed point,

00:53:27.650 --> 00:53:29.810
then the oscillations
really disappear.

00:53:29.810 --> 00:53:32.240
It's really only as
k goes way, way out.

00:53:40.890 --> 00:53:42.860
And I maybe won't
do this calculation.

00:53:42.860 --> 00:53:45.151
But you can do it quickly.

00:53:45.151 --> 00:53:47.650
It's the kind of thing you can
do in five minutes on an exam

00:53:47.650 --> 00:53:48.332
or so, right?

00:53:50.986 --> 00:53:52.610
But then the question
you might ask me,

00:53:52.610 --> 00:53:55.951
well what can you do in order to
get these oscillations that we

00:53:55.951 --> 00:53:56.450
really like?

00:53:56.450 --> 00:53:59.410
These sustained limit
cycle oscillations?

00:53:59.410 --> 00:54:03.370
And there are two ways
you can think about this.

00:54:03.370 --> 00:54:05.610
One is by a kind of
taking this sort of model

00:54:05.610 --> 00:54:08.680
and adding features and
playing with it and so forth.

00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:12.060
Or you can ask a mathematician
who kind of derives everything

00:54:12.060 --> 00:54:14.200
in kind of totality.

00:54:14.200 --> 00:54:16.500
And then you can see it.

00:54:16.500 --> 00:54:19.650
I'll say that one thing you
can do on a concrete basis

00:54:19.650 --> 00:54:23.770
to change the outcome of this
is you can add something that

00:54:23.770 --> 00:54:29.570
is kind of like some
saturation effect

00:54:29.570 --> 00:54:34.350
at the level of the interaction
between predator and prey.

00:54:34.350 --> 00:54:40.430
So instead of scaling
purely as x times y,

00:54:40.430 --> 00:54:46.600
if instead there some sort of
Michaelis-Menten type behavior

00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:50.500
as a function of the
prey, then this model

00:54:50.500 --> 00:54:56.360
is actually converted to one
that has a stable limit cycle.

00:54:56.360 --> 00:54:59.190
And in this case,
can you guys remember

00:54:59.190 --> 00:55:01.892
how you show that something
has a stable limit cycle?

00:55:14.784 --> 00:55:15.284
Yes.

00:55:15.284 --> 00:55:18.260
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
use the Poincare--

00:55:18.260 --> 00:55:20.090
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:55:20.090 --> 00:55:22.730
There's this
Poincare-Bendixson theorem,

00:55:22.730 --> 00:55:26.630
which tells us that if we
can draw some box out here

00:55:26.630 --> 00:55:30.025
where the trajectories are all
kind of coming in, indeed, here

00:55:30.025 --> 00:55:31.650
the trajectories are
kind of coming in.

00:55:36.020 --> 00:55:38.230
Now in this case
the trajectories

00:55:38.230 --> 00:55:39.830
have to come in everywhere.

00:55:39.830 --> 00:55:41.930
But this is
typically true in any

00:55:41.930 --> 00:55:44.380
of these reasonable systems.

00:55:44.380 --> 00:55:48.120
Because they should, if there's
just not that much food,

00:55:48.120 --> 00:55:49.850
they should be coming in.

00:55:49.850 --> 00:55:52.962
Now in this case, there's
a single fixed point.

00:55:52.962 --> 00:55:55.170
So then the question of
whether there's a limit cycle

00:55:55.170 --> 00:55:57.450
is equivalent to the
question of the stability

00:55:57.450 --> 00:55:59.140
of this interior fixed point.

00:55:59.140 --> 00:56:02.080
It's a stable fixed point,
then all of these trajectories

00:56:02.080 --> 00:56:03.250
will spiral in.

00:56:06.420 --> 00:56:08.310
However, if it's an
unstable fixed point,

00:56:08.310 --> 00:56:10.685
then you have to have a limit
cycle oscillation somewhere

00:56:10.685 --> 00:56:11.990
in between.

00:56:11.990 --> 00:56:13.148
Yes.

00:56:13.148 --> 00:56:16.016
AUDIENCE: It could be that
it's a stable midpoint.

00:56:16.016 --> 00:56:19.840
And then you have
two limit cycles.

00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:22.202
Could that be?

00:56:22.202 --> 00:56:22.910
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:56:22.910 --> 00:56:26.370
So the question is whether
there can be a stable limit

00:56:26.370 --> 00:56:30.130
cycle and two limit cycles.

00:56:30.130 --> 00:56:34.550
I think that that requires
more fixed points.

00:56:34.550 --> 00:56:40.500
Because let's say you
had a limit cycle here.

00:56:40.500 --> 00:56:42.750
That this is saying that
the trajectories come in.

00:56:42.750 --> 00:56:45.680
But it's also saying the
trajectories are coming out.

00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:48.620
I think that you have to have
a fixed point inside here

00:56:48.620 --> 00:56:53.120
in order to have these
trajectories going--

00:56:53.120 --> 00:56:55.362
AUDIENCE: So what I'm
saying [INAUDIBLE]

00:56:55.362 --> 00:56:58.743
two circles, and way
outside, all the trajectory

00:56:58.743 --> 00:57:00.250
is [INAUDIBLE].

00:57:00.250 --> 00:57:02.124
But between the two
circles, the trajectories

00:57:02.124 --> 00:57:04.539
go from the outer circle
to the inner circle.

00:57:04.539 --> 00:57:08.370
And then from the inner
circle in [INAUDIBLE].

00:57:08.370 --> 00:57:10.750
PROFESSOR: Are the circles
encircling each other?

00:57:10.750 --> 00:57:11.697
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:57:11.697 --> 00:57:12.280
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:57:12.280 --> 00:57:13.380
So here's one circle.

00:57:13.380 --> 00:57:15.670
Here's another circle.

00:57:15.670 --> 00:57:19.950
And the trajectories
are coming into this one

00:57:19.950 --> 00:57:21.245
and what are they doing?

00:57:21.245 --> 00:57:23.920
AUDIENCE: So each of these limit
cycles are only semi-stable.

00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:24.744
There are some--

00:57:24.744 --> 00:57:25.410
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:57:25.410 --> 00:57:25.909
All right.

00:57:25.909 --> 00:57:26.640
All right.

00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:28.390
So you're talking about
these limit cycles

00:57:28.390 --> 00:57:31.260
where the trajectories
come to it from one side,

00:57:31.260 --> 00:57:33.000
but then leave from
the other side.

00:57:36.650 --> 00:57:38.750
I'd have to think
about this more.

00:57:38.750 --> 00:57:40.300
Everything that
I'm talking about

00:57:40.300 --> 00:57:42.897
are the limit cycles that
are stable from both sides.

00:57:42.897 --> 00:57:45.230
And I think that in the
presence of any amount of noise,

00:57:45.230 --> 00:57:47.790
those are the only ones
that we care about.

00:57:47.790 --> 00:57:51.791
Because you can write these
models where you have orbits

00:57:51.791 --> 00:57:53.790
that are stable from one
side but not the other.

00:57:53.790 --> 00:57:58.169
But then they don't
matter in any real system

00:57:58.169 --> 00:57:59.210
that is subject to noise.

00:57:59.210 --> 00:58:01.590
Because it's not a stable
orbit in that case, right?

00:58:01.590 --> 00:58:04.412
AUDIENCE: Then we can make
the outer circle stable

00:58:04.412 --> 00:58:06.570
from both sides, and the
inner circle [INAUDIBLE]

00:58:06.570 --> 00:58:11.080
from both sides, and we
could get it [INAUDIBLE].

00:58:11.080 --> 00:58:13.010
PROFESSOR: OK So it
could go like this.

00:58:13.010 --> 00:58:14.885
So you're saying that
this outer orbit is now

00:58:14.885 --> 00:58:16.130
stable from both sides.

00:58:16.130 --> 00:58:19.620
And then this one is
unstable from here.

00:58:19.620 --> 00:58:23.090
And oh, OK.

00:58:23.090 --> 00:58:25.940
Now you're saying this thing
is unstable from-- so now

00:58:25.940 --> 00:58:28.528
it's stable.

00:58:28.528 --> 00:58:29.986
AUDIENCE: So we can have--

00:58:34.965 --> 00:58:35.590
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:58:35.590 --> 00:58:35.790
OK.

00:58:35.790 --> 00:58:37.510
So I can certainly
draw the trajectories,

00:58:37.510 --> 00:58:38.470
as you pointed out.

00:58:38.470 --> 00:58:39.220
And it works.

00:58:42.781 --> 00:58:43.280
Yeah.

00:58:43.280 --> 00:58:44.696
I don't know if
this is a loophole

00:58:44.696 --> 00:58:47.500
in the wording of the theorem,
or if this is just not

00:58:47.500 --> 00:58:48.390
possible.

00:58:48.390 --> 00:58:53.850
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] There's
like one way in which it

00:58:53.850 --> 00:58:54.350
applies.

00:58:54.350 --> 00:58:56.400
And then the other way
you kind of usually

00:58:56.400 --> 00:58:58.080
think that it applies,
but then you're

00:58:58.080 --> 00:59:00.038
wrong because there are
these counter examples.

00:59:00.038 --> 00:59:00.920
PROFESSOR: I see.

00:59:00.920 --> 00:59:03.230
Well, how about this.

00:59:03.230 --> 00:59:04.180
I will look it up.

00:59:04.180 --> 00:59:08.520
And then I will tell you
what I think the answer is.

00:59:08.520 --> 00:59:13.270
I'm certainly not going to be
able to derive it on the spot.

00:59:13.270 --> 00:59:15.970
But You're right, though.

00:59:15.970 --> 00:59:19.042
I can draw the orbits
and they do it.

00:59:19.042 --> 00:59:20.250
I don't know what that means.

00:59:24.612 --> 00:59:26.070
AUDIENCE: So I
think the theorem is

00:59:26.070 --> 00:59:28.171
if on this large circle
on the outside everything

00:59:28.171 --> 00:59:30.435
is coming in, then if your
fixed point is unstable,

00:59:30.435 --> 00:59:32.894
then you must have at least
one stable [INAUDIBLE] outside.

00:59:32.894 --> 00:59:34.935
Or you must have at least
one that is [INAUDIBLE]

00:59:34.935 --> 00:59:35.970
or something like that.

00:59:35.970 --> 00:59:36.553
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:59:36.553 --> 00:59:38.110
But you're saying that it--

00:59:38.110 --> 00:59:41.400
AUDIENCE: But if you flip it
so the fixed point is stable,

00:59:41.400 --> 00:59:44.182
then you could have--

00:59:44.182 --> 00:59:44.890
PROFESSOR: I see.

00:59:44.890 --> 00:59:45.980
That may be right.

00:59:48.810 --> 00:59:51.460
I can't remember
which direction.

00:59:54.940 --> 00:59:58.370
But I'll look it up.

00:59:58.370 --> 01:00:00.950
But if you are curious about
the situations in which

01:00:00.950 --> 01:00:04.310
these predator/prey functions
will have limit cycles,

01:00:04.310 --> 01:00:07.730
you can look up
Kolmogorov's conditions.

01:00:07.730 --> 01:00:11.440
So he basically has
these four conditions

01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:13.430
in which you will
get a stable limit

01:00:13.430 --> 01:00:16.140
cycle in the
predator/prey populations.

01:00:16.140 --> 01:00:18.640
And maybe I will.

01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:20.450
And they're surprisingly simple.

01:00:32.039 --> 01:00:33.080
They were in the reading.

01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:34.210
So you can look at them.

01:00:34.210 --> 01:00:37.790
But they're basically just these
questions of the derivatives.

01:00:37.790 --> 01:00:40.730
And they're derivatives of
the per capita growth rates.

01:00:40.730 --> 01:00:43.010
So you take those
functions, you divide by x.

01:00:43.010 --> 01:00:44.250
So it's x dot over x.

01:00:44.250 --> 01:00:47.230
And then it's some f,
y dot over y, sub g.

01:00:47.230 --> 01:00:51.740
And the derivatives of
those functions withe

01:00:51.740 --> 01:00:53.570
respect to x and y
have to be something,

01:00:53.570 --> 01:00:55.050
at least in some limits.

01:00:55.050 --> 01:00:58.990
And then you get limit cycles.

01:00:58.990 --> 01:01:01.150
But I want to talk
about the experiments.

01:01:01.150 --> 01:01:03.450
Because I think that
they were quite pretty.

01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:09.740
So this is a paper
by Yoshida, et al.

01:01:16.290 --> 01:01:27.340
This is Nature 2003.

01:01:27.340 --> 01:01:30.380
And the title was "Rapid
Evolution Drives Ecological

01:01:30.380 --> 01:01:33.031
Dynamics in a
Predator/ Prey System."

01:01:33.031 --> 01:01:34.780
Could somebody kind
of say what they think

01:01:34.780 --> 01:01:37.020
is the big point of this paper?

01:01:50.936 --> 01:01:55.560
Do you guys like the
paper, dislike the paper?

01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:56.210
Too long?

01:01:56.210 --> 01:01:57.330
Was it three pages?

01:02:00.304 --> 01:02:02.470
Although it's really only--
I mean, one of the pages

01:02:02.470 --> 01:02:03.870
is figures.

01:02:03.870 --> 01:02:06.370
And one of the pages
is essentially methods.

01:02:06.370 --> 01:02:09.000
So it's really basically
a one-page paper,

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.550
so it's not such
heavy lifting, maybe.

01:02:19.340 --> 01:02:19.840
All right.

01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:21.970
Maybe I'll be concrete.

01:02:21.970 --> 01:02:25.230
What features of their
predator/prey oscillations

01:02:25.230 --> 01:02:27.876
were different from a normal
predator/prey oscillation?

01:02:27.876 --> 01:02:30.000
What were the features they
were trying to explain?

01:02:37.175 --> 01:02:40.607
AUDIENCE: There's a longer
phase life between the maximum.

01:02:40.607 --> 01:02:42.940
PROFESSOR: And this is an
interesting history, actually,

01:02:42.940 --> 01:02:47.970
that these are authors-- they
took what I think are basically

01:02:47.970 --> 01:02:51.200
like samples from the Great
Lakes, or something like that.

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:53.210
So they took a
predator and prey.

01:02:53.210 --> 01:02:59.070
So it's a rotifer algal system.

01:02:59.070 --> 01:03:02.920
So the rotifer eats algae.

01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:09.937
They had previously published a
paper just a few years before,

01:03:09.937 --> 01:03:11.770
where it was called
something like "Crossing

01:03:11.770 --> 01:03:14.640
the Hopf Bifurcation in
a Predator/Prey System."

01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:17.380
And so what they did is
they had a chemostat where

01:03:17.380 --> 01:03:20.330
there was some constant rate
of dilution in their chemostat.

01:03:20.330 --> 01:03:24.100
And then they measured the
dynamics between the predator

01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:25.780
and the prey.

01:03:25.780 --> 01:03:27.980
And they showed
that depending upon,

01:03:27.980 --> 01:03:30.670
for example, the
nutrients or this dilution

01:03:30.670 --> 01:03:33.240
rate in their chemostat, they
could go from a situation

01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:38.066
where you have a
stable coexistence--

01:03:38.066 --> 01:03:40.190
so a stable fixed point
between the predator/prey--

01:03:40.190 --> 01:03:42.510
but at increasing dilution
rate, they started

01:03:42.510 --> 01:03:45.990
getting these oscillations.

01:03:45.990 --> 01:03:49.070
So they went from
stable to oscillations.

01:03:49.070 --> 01:03:50.880
And then at higher
dilution rates,

01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:54.330
they got collapse of this
predator/prey system.

01:03:54.330 --> 01:03:56.590
So this is crossing the
so-called Hopf bifurcation,

01:03:56.590 --> 01:03:59.350
where you go from
stable to unstable.

01:03:59.350 --> 01:04:03.440
So they could actually see that
they could use a simple model

01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:04.910
to try to get some
insight into why

01:04:04.910 --> 01:04:06.737
it is that a predator/prey
system might oscillate

01:04:06.737 --> 01:04:07.950
or it might not oscillate.

01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:12.040
And so that was great.

01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:13.790
But there were some
features in their data

01:04:13.790 --> 01:04:16.220
that they didn't understand.

01:04:16.220 --> 01:04:21.090
So the features were
that the oscillations

01:04:21.090 --> 01:04:22.280
had a really long period.

01:04:25.030 --> 01:04:26.100
Long period oscillations.

01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:37.820
And in all this data,
it's a little bit hard

01:04:37.820 --> 01:04:42.550
to get the exact phase lag,
but in many of the cases

01:04:42.550 --> 01:04:45.830
they saw that the
predator and prey were not

01:04:45.830 --> 01:04:49.380
at this 90 degrees out of
phase like you would expect.

01:04:49.380 --> 01:04:51.930
And in particular,
for the predator/prey,

01:04:51.930 --> 01:04:56.380
given that you have x and y, and
it's going around some circle,

01:04:56.380 --> 01:05:01.840
the idea is that first
the prey population peaks.

01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:07.080
And then kind of 90
degrees later phase,

01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:09.960
you get a peak of the predator.

01:05:09.960 --> 01:05:15.190
And you can imagine that
in any predator/prey model

01:05:15.190 --> 01:05:17.265
that you write down,
not just Lotka-Volterra,

01:05:17.265 --> 01:05:19.140
but if you write down
a differential equation

01:05:19.140 --> 01:05:23.980
with some x and some y,
it's hard to get something

01:05:23.980 --> 01:05:25.800
where it looks much different.

01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:28.740
Of course, you can imagine
maybe funny orbits or something

01:05:28.740 --> 01:05:29.920
like that.

01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:36.040
But generically you really
expect this 90 degree phase

01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:38.320
lag of the predator
relative to the prey.

01:05:41.137 --> 01:05:42.720
Whereas in the
experiments, they often

01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:57.204
saw 180 degree lag, lack of
predator relative to the prey.

01:05:57.204 --> 01:05:57.704
Yes.

01:05:57.704 --> 01:06:00.184
AUDIENCE: So when you
say [INAUDIBLE] theory

01:06:00.184 --> 01:06:02.664
of oscillation,
what does that mean?

01:06:02.664 --> 01:06:04.650
What's the time scale?

01:06:04.650 --> 01:06:05.517
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:06:05.517 --> 01:06:08.380
AUDIENCE: What would make
this suprisingly [INAUDIBLE]?

01:06:08.380 --> 01:06:09.251
PROFESSOR: Right.

01:06:09.251 --> 01:06:09.750
Yeah.

01:06:09.750 --> 01:06:09.930
OK.

01:06:09.930 --> 01:06:11.805
So this is really in
the context of-- I mean,

01:06:11.805 --> 01:06:14.800
they wrote down a model
where they did basically have

01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:18.514
something like this, where
they said there's some--

01:06:18.514 --> 01:06:21.340
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:06:21.340 --> 01:06:22.830
PROFESSOR: That's right.

01:06:22.830 --> 01:06:25.390
And in particular the
predator, I think,

01:06:25.390 --> 01:06:27.260
was not really
dying on it's own.

01:06:27.260 --> 01:06:29.300
Except for the dilution.

01:06:29.300 --> 01:06:32.920
So it's really the dilution rate
from the chemostat gave them c.

01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:35.570
And they could see that indeed,
the rotifer wasn't dying much.

01:06:35.570 --> 01:06:37.150
And then a is telling
you about what

01:06:37.150 --> 01:06:39.834
happens if you don't
have the rotifer,

01:06:39.834 --> 01:06:41.000
you don't have the predator.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:42.680
And then at that
dilution rate, you

01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:45.050
ask what the division rate is.

01:06:45.050 --> 01:06:47.530
And that's essentially
the growth rate

01:06:47.530 --> 01:06:50.360
of that prey population
minus the dilution

01:06:50.360 --> 01:06:51.560
rate of the chemostat.

01:06:51.560 --> 01:06:54.880
I'd say that they had these
parameters pretty well.

01:07:01.620 --> 01:07:02.120
Yes.

01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:07.740
And what they saw experimentally
was that it took much longer.

01:07:07.740 --> 01:07:12.264
I mean, the period was
5 times, 10 times longer

01:07:12.264 --> 01:07:13.680
than what they
would have expected

01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:17.810
based on the measured parameters
for the predator and the prey.

01:07:24.980 --> 01:07:27.140
And of course, that
was annoying for them,

01:07:27.140 --> 01:07:29.400
because they're actually
doing the experiments.

01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:31.483
So they had to do these
chemostat experiments that

01:07:31.483 --> 01:07:33.660
lasted six months or
something like that, in order

01:07:33.660 --> 01:07:35.770
to see a couple oscillations.

01:07:35.770 --> 01:07:40.120
And so this longer period
wasn't just a mathematical--

01:07:40.120 --> 01:07:42.270
I'm sure that they were
disappointed to see

01:07:42.270 --> 01:07:44.734
these really long time-scale
oscillations, because it was

01:07:44.734 --> 01:07:46.650
something that made it
very difficult for them

01:07:46.650 --> 01:07:47.608
to do the measurements.

01:07:51.940 --> 01:07:54.670
But this is what they
saw experimentally.

01:07:54.670 --> 01:07:57.970
And they didn't know
what was causing it.

01:07:57.970 --> 01:08:02.600
But they later then
did more modeling

01:08:02.600 --> 01:08:05.880
where they asked, which
of the assumptions

01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:09.200
in our original model
might not be true.

01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:10.685
And the nature of
these things is

01:08:10.685 --> 01:08:12.060
that there are an
infinite number

01:08:12.060 --> 01:08:16.380
of things are true that are
not incorporated in the model.

01:08:16.380 --> 01:08:17.939
And this makes it
quite challenging

01:08:17.939 --> 01:08:19.569
to isolate what the
effects might be.

01:08:19.569 --> 01:08:22.960
But at the very least what
they can do is they can go in.

01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:24.944
And they have some
sense of their system.

01:08:24.944 --> 01:08:26.319
And they can make
guesses of what

01:08:26.319 --> 01:08:27.960
might have been the
primary things missing.

01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:29.290
And then they kind of
went through the models

01:08:29.290 --> 01:08:30.749
and they asked,
well, if we kind of

01:08:30.749 --> 01:08:32.498
change this assumption
or that assumption,

01:08:32.498 --> 01:08:34.439
what does it do in terms
of the oscillations.

01:08:34.439 --> 01:08:37.729
And then what they found
in a modeling paper--

01:08:37.729 --> 01:08:41.779
so this is their previous
experimental paper before this.

01:08:41.779 --> 01:08:46.020
What they found in
their models was

01:08:46.020 --> 01:08:50.259
that prey evolution was
kind of the one thing

01:08:50.259 --> 01:08:52.100
that if they allowed
prey evolution, i.e.

01:08:52.100 --> 01:08:54.450
If they allowed
different types of prey

01:08:54.450 --> 01:08:56.029
in their prey
population that might

01:08:56.029 --> 01:08:58.840
be oscillating
independently, then they

01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:00.670
could get both of these effects.

01:09:00.670 --> 01:09:02.240
So from the models
they concluded

01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:07.420
that prey evolution
could give this,

01:09:07.420 --> 01:09:09.950
could maybe explain
those two things.

01:09:14.613 --> 01:09:16.279
These are the two
experimental features.

01:09:19.819 --> 01:09:21.064
Yeah.

01:09:21.064 --> 01:09:22.540
AUDIENCE: It might
be that you have

01:09:22.540 --> 01:09:24.508
[INAUDIBLE] symantic point.

01:09:24.508 --> 01:09:29.889
If you have two types of
species, pre-species--

01:09:29.889 --> 01:09:34.116
[INAUDIBLE] they have
these characteristics

01:09:34.116 --> 01:09:36.044
and they're not evolving.

01:09:36.044 --> 01:09:37.490
They're just fixed.

01:09:37.490 --> 01:09:38.356
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:09:38.356 --> 01:09:39.939
AUDIENCE: You would
still be able to--

01:09:39.939 --> 01:09:40.479
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

01:09:40.479 --> 01:09:40.979
Right.

01:09:40.979 --> 01:09:41.826
This is a major--

01:09:41.826 --> 01:09:42.700
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:43.160
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:45.618
You can argue about what you
want to call evolution and not

01:09:45.618 --> 01:09:47.359
revolution.

01:09:47.359 --> 01:09:51.350
Over these time scales what
they are not looking at

01:09:51.350 --> 01:09:55.070
is the de novo kind of emergence
of new mutants spreading

01:09:55.070 --> 01:09:55.990
in the population.

01:09:55.990 --> 01:10:00.410
What they're looking at
is variations in say,

01:10:00.410 --> 01:10:03.703
different types of prey.

01:10:03.703 --> 01:10:08.020
AUDIENCE: So is that what
we would call evolution?

01:10:08.020 --> 01:10:09.450
PROFESSOR: Well, OK.

01:10:09.450 --> 01:10:10.700
This is a major question.

01:10:10.700 --> 01:10:13.926
I think different people call
evolution different things.

01:10:13.926 --> 01:10:15.550
And in particular
there's a distinction

01:10:15.550 --> 01:10:22.100
between the ecologists and
the evolutionary biologists,

01:10:22.100 --> 01:10:24.250
or evolutionary
microbiologists, or whatnot.

01:10:24.250 --> 01:10:29.390
And this is something that
I certainly encounter.

01:10:29.390 --> 01:10:32.310
For the experimental
microbial evolution guys,

01:10:32.310 --> 01:10:35.224
I'd say that for them, if you
use the word "evolution," what

01:10:35.224 --> 01:10:36.890
they really want to
see, or what they're

01:10:36.890 --> 01:10:39.930
expecting to see is kind
of new mutants arising

01:10:39.930 --> 01:10:42.479
in the population,
spreading, fixing,

01:10:42.479 --> 01:10:44.520
and that changes the
character of the population.

01:10:44.520 --> 01:10:47.110
Whereas from that
standpoint of ecologists--

01:10:47.110 --> 01:10:50.880
and indeed, if you look up
the definition of evolution,

01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:53.660
it's some change in allele
frequency over time.

01:10:53.660 --> 01:10:56.200
And this could certainly be
a change allele frequency

01:10:56.200 --> 01:10:59.010
over time in the sense that you
could imagine this arising just

01:10:59.010 --> 01:11:03.630
from, for example, there
could be a point mutation

01:11:03.630 --> 01:11:06.470
in some gene that leads it
to do something or another.

01:11:06.470 --> 01:11:08.070
And in this paper
they didn't identify

01:11:08.070 --> 01:11:09.070
exactly what was going on.

01:11:09.070 --> 01:11:11.236
I'll tell you a little bit
about a later paper where

01:11:11.236 --> 01:11:12.540
they get a better sense of it.

01:11:12.540 --> 01:11:14.540
But at least you could
imagine it being the case

01:11:14.540 --> 01:11:16.700
that there's just a point
mutation, some gene that

01:11:16.700 --> 01:11:19.750
has some fitness defect in
the absence of the predator,

01:11:19.750 --> 01:11:22.541
but then allows the algae to
avoid the predator in some way.

01:11:22.541 --> 01:11:25.490
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:11:25.490 --> 01:11:26.629
PROFESSOR: That's right.

01:11:26.629 --> 01:11:27.170
That's right.

01:11:27.170 --> 01:11:29.080
As far as the model
goes, it could

01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:31.800
be that the prey are
really-- one species was just

01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:32.550
a point mutation.

01:11:32.550 --> 01:11:33.550
Then you'd say, oh yeah.

01:11:33.550 --> 01:11:35.420
That's kind of evolution.

01:11:35.420 --> 01:11:40.230
Or it could be two different
prey populations and so forth.

01:11:40.230 --> 01:11:40.730
Right?

01:11:40.730 --> 01:11:44.330
And depending upon what
information you have access to,

01:11:44.330 --> 01:11:46.899
you would either be aware
of these things or not.

01:11:46.899 --> 01:11:48.940
In this case, they just
look under the microscope

01:11:48.940 --> 01:11:51.790
and say, oh yeah, this looks
like an algae, or whatnot.

01:11:51.790 --> 01:11:54.040
And maybe they know that
it's the same species.

01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:58.570
But they could be different
in lots of different ways.

01:11:58.570 --> 01:12:01.830
And I think this
discussion is highlighting

01:12:01.830 --> 01:12:07.290
that a lot of the same effects
that you see in ecology also

01:12:07.290 --> 01:12:09.420
you see in evolution
and vice versa.

01:12:09.420 --> 01:12:15.019
And depending upon
your focus, you

01:12:15.019 --> 01:12:17.060
might want to put it more
in the bin of evolution

01:12:17.060 --> 01:12:18.850
or in terms of
population dynamics.

01:12:18.850 --> 01:12:23.890
I think that's a matter of
taste at some point, actually.

01:12:23.890 --> 01:12:24.390
Yeah.

01:12:24.390 --> 01:12:25.764
Because they say
rapid evolution.

01:12:25.764 --> 01:12:27.001
And I think--

01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:31.302
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:12:31.302 --> 01:12:32.260
PROFESSOR: Yeah, right.

01:12:32.260 --> 01:12:35.352
So I think that
different people will

01:12:35.352 --> 01:12:36.560
have different takes on this.

01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:38.018
I think, once again,
this is really

01:12:38.018 --> 01:12:39.980
very much from the
standpoint of an ecologist,

01:12:39.980 --> 01:12:41.040
this is rapid evolution.

01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:45.674
Because every cycle, the
allele frequency is changing.

01:12:45.674 --> 01:12:47.340
And that's what's
maybe leading to this.

01:12:47.340 --> 01:12:49.670
But the thing is,
it's very easy for you

01:12:49.670 --> 01:12:51.720
to read certainly the
title, and come away

01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:54.270
thinking it's something
different from what it was.

01:12:56.780 --> 01:12:57.403
I agree.

01:13:00.930 --> 01:13:04.150
But one of the things I
like about this whole line

01:13:04.150 --> 01:13:06.720
of research that took place over
the course of say, 15 years,

01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:12.060
was that they did these
nice measurements.

01:13:12.060 --> 01:13:15.050
They're guided by models.

01:13:15.050 --> 01:13:17.430
They saw some things
that they were expecting,

01:13:17.430 --> 01:13:18.960
some things they
couldn't explain.

01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:20.869
And then they went
and did more modeling.

01:13:20.869 --> 01:13:22.160
And then they could explain it.

01:13:22.160 --> 01:13:26.162
And that guided this experiment.

01:13:26.162 --> 01:13:27.870
Because before what
they did is they just

01:13:27.870 --> 01:13:30.954
took kind of the sludge,
or whatever, from the lake.

01:13:30.954 --> 01:13:32.370
So there were many
different types

01:13:32.370 --> 01:13:34.360
of algae and of the
rotifer, for that matter.

01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:36.610
And then they looked at the
predator/prey oscillations

01:13:36.610 --> 01:13:37.480
between those.

01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:39.090
And then in this
paper what they did

01:13:39.090 --> 01:13:41.470
is they took individual
prey populations that

01:13:41.470 --> 01:13:42.990
came from a single prey.

01:13:42.990 --> 01:13:45.619
So they were kind of isogenic.

01:13:45.619 --> 01:13:48.160
Of course eventually they would
evolve, and blah, blah, blah.

01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:51.190
But in this case they
took individual isolates

01:13:51.190 --> 01:13:52.090
from the prey.

01:13:52.090 --> 01:13:56.120
And then what they saw is that
these two features went away.

01:13:56.120 --> 01:13:58.540
The oscillation period was
more what they were expecting.

01:13:58.540 --> 01:14:01.740
And they got the 90
degree phase lag.

01:14:01.740 --> 01:14:04.160
So it's was really a
case of these models

01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:13.720
led to the experiments where
they took kind of clonal prey.

01:14:13.720 --> 01:14:16.160
And then they recovered
their classical predictions.

01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:31.172
And indeed, they've recently
done some other measurements

01:14:31.172 --> 01:14:32.380
that I think were quite nice.

01:14:32.380 --> 01:14:35.760
They had an ecology letters
paper just a couple years ago

01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:42.450
where what they did is they
took two different algae that

01:14:42.450 --> 01:14:47.310
had different types embodying
these trade-offs that we

01:14:47.310 --> 01:14:48.530
were talking about.

01:14:48.530 --> 01:14:53.970
In particular, one of the
algae can divide rapidly.

01:14:53.970 --> 01:14:55.840
But it kind of
exists as singles.

01:14:55.840 --> 01:15:01.240
Another algae is kind of clumpy.

01:15:01.240 --> 01:15:04.920
So this algal type was
able to divide more rapidly

01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:06.220
than this algal type.

01:15:06.220 --> 01:15:12.070
But this type was harder to
eat just because it was clumpy.

01:15:12.070 --> 01:15:12.630
OK?

01:15:12.630 --> 01:15:18.220
It's one of things that once
you hear it, you say, oh yeah.

01:15:18.220 --> 01:15:18.780
Sure.

01:15:18.780 --> 01:15:24.510
But then in the abstract,
when you read this 2003 paper,

01:15:24.510 --> 01:15:27.720
you think, oh, I can't
imagine what kind of behavior

01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:31.190
could possibly help the
algae avoid these rotifers.

01:15:31.190 --> 01:15:34.710
But then in this ecology
letters paper, what they did

01:15:34.710 --> 01:15:38.070
is they actually tracked
population densities

01:15:38.070 --> 01:15:42.090
of this type, this type, and
of the rotifer over time.

01:15:42.090 --> 01:15:46.024
So then they could see all three
sub-populations oscillating.

01:15:46.024 --> 01:15:47.440
So then you can
really kind of see

01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:51.710
how this evolution, if you
want, or you could just say it's

01:15:51.710 --> 01:15:52.210
ecology.

01:15:52.210 --> 01:15:54.620
Because it could be different
species for all we care.

01:15:56.970 --> 01:16:02.380
But in any case, it's certainly
prey heterogeneity anyway you

01:16:02.380 --> 01:16:02.880
look at it.

01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:04.296
Whether it's
evolution or ecology.

01:16:04.296 --> 01:16:07.930
It's heterogeneity in
the prey population that

01:16:07.930 --> 01:16:11.194
leads to these
very qualitatively

01:16:11.194 --> 01:16:12.610
different population
oscillations.

01:16:17.730 --> 01:16:19.480
Any other questions
on that before we--

01:16:23.050 --> 01:16:24.550
And so just for the
last few minutes

01:16:24.550 --> 01:16:26.620
I'll say something
about this question

01:16:26.620 --> 01:16:29.040
of noise-induced oscillations.

01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:31.890
This is going to
be something you're

01:16:31.890 --> 01:16:35.630
going to be playing
with over the next week.

01:16:35.630 --> 01:16:39.940
So you'll be experts eventually.

01:16:39.940 --> 01:16:42.300
And the discussion
in the homework

01:16:42.300 --> 01:16:44.680
is really guided by this
paper by McKane and Newman.

01:16:49.290 --> 01:16:50.830
All right.

01:16:50.830 --> 01:16:51.570
So McKane.

01:16:51.570 --> 01:16:53.200
Newman.

01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:56.300
McKane is a professor
at Manchester.

01:16:56.300 --> 01:17:03.360
And what they showed is that
if you take this model here,

01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:06.560
did this model have
limit cycle oscillations,

01:17:06.560 --> 01:17:08.520
sustained oscillations?

01:17:08.520 --> 01:17:09.560
No.

01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:12.160
So this model where we
include the carrying

01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:13.920
capacity of the
prey, this does not

01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:15.380
have sustained oscillations.

01:17:15.380 --> 01:17:23.350
So you take a model like this
that just has a stable spiral.

01:17:23.350 --> 01:17:26.200
Now this is a model in
the context of-- it's

01:17:26.200 --> 01:17:28.270
a differential equation model.

01:17:28.270 --> 01:17:33.080
Now the question is, how
do you incorporate noise?

01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:35.730
Just the fact that
individuals give birth,

01:17:35.730 --> 01:17:37.140
they die at random times.

01:17:39.860 --> 01:17:42.260
The first order way that we
often think to do this is we

01:17:42.260 --> 01:17:46.270
just add some noise on to
the differential equations.

01:17:46.270 --> 01:17:50.010
So what we do is, you might say,
oh well, you could add some a

01:17:50.010 --> 01:17:54.390
to x, and some a to y.

01:17:54.390 --> 01:17:57.970
Maybe this noise should be
proportional to x or something.

01:17:57.970 --> 01:18:00.000
So you could think about
the strength of this

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.180
might be some pre-factor.

01:18:02.180 --> 01:18:05.550
So you could just take kind
of a [INAUDIBLE] approach

01:18:05.550 --> 01:18:08.480
where you add noise onto
the differential equations.

01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:11.800
And then what you
get is a noisy kind

01:18:11.800 --> 01:18:16.155
of path to that fixed point.

01:18:16.155 --> 01:18:21.940
The perhaps surprising thing
is that instead of adding noise

01:18:21.940 --> 01:18:24.280
to a differential
equation, if instead you

01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:26.670
start with the individual
based approach,

01:18:26.670 --> 01:18:28.300
and you take kind
of a master equation

01:18:28.300 --> 01:18:30.810
approach where you say
they're individuals

01:18:30.810 --> 01:18:32.420
and they're doing something.

01:18:32.420 --> 01:18:35.740
Individual predators are eating
individual prey, et cetera.

01:18:35.740 --> 01:18:44.160
So if instead you take
a master equation,

01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:48.210
just like what we
did for the chemical

01:18:48.210 --> 01:18:50.406
equations modeling
the cells and so forth

01:18:50.406 --> 01:18:52.530
that we talked about at
the beginning of the class,

01:18:52.530 --> 01:18:55.780
if you formulate this
predator/prey system

01:18:55.780 --> 01:19:00.460
as an underlying set of kind of
individual based interactions,

01:19:00.460 --> 01:19:04.720
then what you actually find is
that you get surprisingly large

01:19:04.720 --> 01:19:08.250
sustained oscillations.

01:19:08.250 --> 01:19:09.800
So you really end
up with a situation

01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:11.350
where this thing comes.

01:19:11.350 --> 01:19:14.580
And it's noisy, of course.

01:19:14.580 --> 01:19:17.450
But it kind of comes
around here in some way

01:19:17.450 --> 01:19:20.200
that looks like this.

01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:24.380
And you'll see this in your
simulations next week where--

01:19:24.380 --> 01:19:26.750
and I don't know if you
can see this at all.

01:19:26.750 --> 01:19:30.590
But this is some plots
of predator and prey

01:19:30.590 --> 01:19:33.420
at reasonably large numbers,
where you can actually

01:19:33.420 --> 01:19:35.520
have 1,000 predator or prey.

01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:39.880
Somehow you can get some
sort of resonant enhancement

01:19:39.880 --> 01:19:41.190
of these oscillations.

01:19:41.190 --> 01:19:42.660
And kind of what's
going on is that

01:19:42.660 --> 01:19:46.720
the demographic fluctuations
of the demographic noise

01:19:46.720 --> 01:19:49.720
excites the system
at all frequencies.

01:19:49.720 --> 01:19:52.240
But then there is a
characteristic frequency

01:19:52.240 --> 01:19:56.150
given basically
by this frequency

01:19:56.150 --> 01:19:58.180
of the inherent
oscillation there

01:19:58.180 --> 01:20:00.500
that is somehow amplified.

01:20:00.500 --> 01:20:02.000
So you end up with
a situation where

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:03.125
you get these oscillations.

01:20:06.690 --> 01:20:09.020
And they're noisy and whatnot.

01:20:09.020 --> 01:20:13.570
But it's really because it's
this particular frequency that

01:20:13.570 --> 01:20:15.280
was amplified.

01:20:15.280 --> 01:20:18.010
And just because it takes
a long time for those

01:20:18.010 --> 01:20:19.340
oscillations to go away.

01:20:19.340 --> 01:20:23.580
So you can imagine that the
amplitude of the oscillation

01:20:23.580 --> 01:20:26.020
falls off as kind of
a root end scaling,

01:20:26.020 --> 01:20:29.130
because it's kind of a
demographic type noise.

01:20:29.130 --> 01:20:31.715
So it is true that
the relative amplitude

01:20:31.715 --> 01:20:33.940
of these oscillations,
it gets larger as you

01:20:33.940 --> 01:20:35.890
to smaller population sizes.

01:20:35.890 --> 01:20:40.850
But it still ends up being
a surprisingly large effect.

01:20:40.850 --> 01:20:43.910
And you'll see how this plays
out in this model that's

01:20:43.910 --> 01:20:45.680
basically guided by this paper.

01:20:45.680 --> 01:20:48.030
And this was a PRL in 2005.

01:20:48.030 --> 01:20:49.650
Incidentally, other
people have since

01:20:49.650 --> 01:20:52.010
studied how these
sorts of ideas can

01:20:52.010 --> 01:20:56.935
result in noise-induced
pattern formation, as well.

01:20:56.935 --> 01:20:59.399
All right, with that,
I will let you guys go.

01:20:59.399 --> 01:21:00.440
Have a good Thanksgiving.

01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:02.810
I'll see you guys on Tuesday.
