00:00:21.012 --> 00:00:22.470
PROFESSOR: Today
what we want to do

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.750
is use the two papers that
you read as kind of a backdrop

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.660
to try to think something
about the regulation of genes

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.730
in response to
changing environments.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.130
So there's the
Mitchell paper that

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.880
is talking about this idea
of anticipatory regulation,

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.530
whereby if the
environmental changes have

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.330
some typical pattern, then maybe
the cells can take advantage

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.480
of that and start preparing
for environment number two

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.000
when the cell sees
environment number one.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.470
But in other cases, it may be
that the environment fluctuates

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.370
in ways that are really
fundamentally unpredictable.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.900
In that case, you can't use the
sort of anticipatory regulation

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.130
strategy, but instead,
there may be a way

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.459
that you can just
stochastically switch

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:07.440
between the different strategies
and implement what's known

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.140
as a bet hedging strategy.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.490
And this is modeled
largely on the work

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.910
that you just read about in
the Kussell paper, Science

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:19.870
maybe May 2005.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:24.560
I do want to stress,
however, that if you observe

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.550
phenotypic heterogeneity
in a clonal population,

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.040
that does not necessarily mean
that the cell or the population

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.970
is implementing one of these
bet hedging strategies.

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.600
In particular, I would
argue rather strongly

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.256
that there are other
possible evolutionary drivers

00:01:39.256 --> 00:01:40.630
for such phenotypic
heterogeneity

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:41.730
in the population.

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.390
First of all, just
because you see

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.740
some phenomena does not mean
it is necessarily selected for.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.830
So it's possible that it's a
side effect of something else.

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.960
However, if you're looking
for an evolutionary kind

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.857
of explanation for
something like this,

00:01:55.857 --> 00:01:57.190
bet hedging is not the only one.

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.030
In particular,
we'll talk about two

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.780
other possible
explanations, and they both

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.870
have to do with kind
of game dynamics

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.900
that we might illuminate
or talk about.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.101
But I guess our game
theory talk was--

00:02:08.101 --> 00:02:10.100
that was a week and a
half ago, almost two weeks

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.170
ago now-- so maybe you've
forgotten all the game

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:13.550
theory that we discussed.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.400
But in particular,
it could be that

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.733
the phenotypic heterogeneity
might be the implementation

00:02:17.733 --> 00:02:19.390
of a mixed strategy.

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.640
Or possibly it could be
an example of some sort

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.630
of altruistic self-sacrifice.

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.980
And we'll try to explain
the theory behind each

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.790
of these three things as well
as possible biological examples

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:32.920
of each of the three.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.240
In this case, we may
think about bet hedging

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:43.770
as maybe an explanation
for antibiotic persistence,

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.150
this idea that cells can
switch into these slow-growing

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.525
persister states
in which they're

00:02:47.525 --> 00:02:49.680
resistant to antibiotics
and other stresses.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.900
Mixed strategies
could be-- well,

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.570
we're going to argue
it could be implemented

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.080
in the context of mixed
sugar environments.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.680
And altruistic
self-sacrifice may

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.954
be the explanation behind
colicin production in bacteria,

00:03:03.954 --> 00:03:04.620
so it's a toxin.

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.230
So I want to start by
thinking about this thing

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.030
about adaptive prediction
of environmental changes

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.050
by Mitchell.

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.810
I think this is a
very interesting paper

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.700
in a number of different ways.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.600
One is, I think that it's
sort of a big idea that

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.550
can be explored in these
simple experiments.

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.990
I think that it's an
exceptionally clear paper

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:34.870
in some ways, and
that they really say,

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.300
oh, we're going to propose
that this strategy should

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.450
be characterized by
these three things.

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.550
And then they go and they try
to show you the three things.

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.270
The figures, I think,
are also very nice,

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:48.010
in the sense that
in many of the cases

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.450
you could have shown the data
just in the context of a table,

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.850
where you said, oh, for
each of these strains, this

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.570
is the up regulation or so.

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.570
But if you had done that,
it would've been much,

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.990
I think, less compelling,
even though of course it's

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:01.410
the same data.

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.780
So I think this is a neat
paper, in my opinion,

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.370
both from the standpoint of the
ideas that are being explored,

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:09.527
but also because it
highlights some of the things

00:04:09.527 --> 00:04:11.110
that you should be
thinking about when

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:12.450
you're writing your own papers.

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.170
You want to try to make the
ideas as clear as possible.

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:18.050
You want to lay
the groundwork so

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:19.730
that what you're
about to show is

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:21.396
going to be-- the
reader's going to feel

00:04:21.396 --> 00:04:23.190
is a really important thing.

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.330
And then you want to take
nice advantage of color

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.290
and some legends that are there.

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:33.280
So we'll kind of talk about
all these issues as we go.

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.280
But before we get
started, can somebody--

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.470
there's a very real sense
that in this field of decision

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:47.000
making and systems biology that
a lot of this research program

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.830
is kind of driven by
following classic ideas

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.370
from other fields.

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.940
And what would be the
corresponding classic idea

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.312
this paper is exploring?

00:04:59.312 --> 00:05:00.270
AUDIENCE: Conditioning.

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:01.269
PROFESSOR: Conditioning.

00:05:01.269 --> 00:05:02.440
Right.

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.062
And whose name do we associate
with conditioning typically?

00:05:05.062 --> 00:05:05.770
AUDIENCE: Pavlov.

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:06.420
PROFESSOR: Pavlov.

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.920
All right.

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.810
So I have not ever
read these studies.

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:11.660
Pavlovian conditioning.

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:16.520
And I think that this is
just-- it's good to highlight.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.061
This is something
that you might have

00:05:18.061 --> 00:05:21.220
learned in your high
school psychology class.

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:26.500
And it's, again, a big idea,
but it's not the kind of thing--

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:27.970
we've all heard--
well, we're going

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:29.261
to talk about this in a moment.

00:05:29.261 --> 00:05:30.980
Many of us, I think,
have heard of this.

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.146
But this is an example
of how you take something

00:05:33.146 --> 00:05:34.770
that you learned in
high school and you

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:39.475
make it useful to your daily
life, or pseudo daily life.

00:05:39.475 --> 00:05:42.100
Because I think you'll see that
there are many kind of examples

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.280
of this throughout
this literature,

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.630
where someone takes an
idea that is, in some ways,

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:51.880
you open up a random textbook
in introductory psychology,

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.420
and you can just
march through and try

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:57.370
to see to what degree the
ideas that were developed

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:59.830
in the context of
humans or animals,

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:02.710
to what degree might they be
relevant in the context of cell

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:03.960
decision making?

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.470
Can somebody just say what is
this Pavlovian conditioning

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:06.970
idea?

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.860
Did you guys take high
school psychology?

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.190
I'm sure somebody did.

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:17.790
No.

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:18.290
All right.

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:20.710
Well, incidentally,
I recommend everybody

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:22.760
should take a solid
introductory psychology

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.400
class if you have not done so.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.420
We offer a class 900.

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:28.700
I'm sure that it's
good and interesting.

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:30.335
Yes.

00:06:30.335 --> 00:06:35.467
AUDIENCE: So there's two
different events or stimuli,

00:06:35.467 --> 00:06:40.377
and in Pavlovian conditioning
you give one and then

00:06:40.377 --> 00:06:43.330
always give the
other one following.

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:44.370
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:48.930
So there's some sense
that what we might call--

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:52.080
there are two
events of some sort.

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.970
One is following the other one,
so it's A and then followed

00:06:55.970 --> 00:07:00.150
by B. And people have done many
different examples of this,

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:03.680
but what's the one
that we typically--

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:08.289
what's the classic
experiment that Pavlov did?

00:07:08.289 --> 00:07:10.330
AUDIENCE: You ring a bell,
and then you get food.

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:10.650
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:11.150
Right.

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:20.860
So you ring a bell and then
you give-- and this is dogs,

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:23.940
at least in the
version I remember.

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:26.117
So you have some dogs,
you do this thing

00:07:26.117 --> 00:07:28.450
where you ring the bell and
then you give them the food.

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:33.048
And what's the response
that you're supposed to get?

00:07:33.048 --> 00:07:33.920
AUDIENCE: Drooling.

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:34.878
PROFESSOR: Yeah, right.

00:07:34.878 --> 00:07:37.080
So the dog is supposed
to start salivating.

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:37.580
OK.

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:39.460
So you might think
your experiments

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:41.190
are gross, but-- right.

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:44.670
So ring a bell, and the idea
is that you can train the dog

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:47.365
to start salivating in response
to the bell, rather than,

00:07:47.365 --> 00:07:48.990
of course, if you
give the food they're

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:50.270
going to start salivating.

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:53.270
But here you can train the
dog to start salivating

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:55.340
in response to the food.

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:59.055
So now, with training,
this results in salivation.

00:08:01.835 --> 00:08:04.870
And did Pavlov show there was
a fitness benefit associated

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:07.430
with the salivation?

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:10.480
Not that I'm not I'm aware of.

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:13.110
But this is the classic
story that we learned

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:14.670
in introductory psychology.

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:19.610
And the question is, can
we apply a similar idea

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:21.340
in the case of microbial
decision making?

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:29.330
Now was this-- can
somebody say what

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:33.510
they think was the
author's contribution

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:37.580
to the literature in the
sense of-- via a vis this?

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:41.450
How much of what-- well, we
can be maybe more concrete.

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:48.239
In the case of E. coli,
what was known-- or maybe

00:08:48.239 --> 00:08:50.030
we should describe the
experiment once more

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:53.930
and then try to figure out
what they did that was new new.

00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:56.714
At least can somebody kind
of summarize the basic idea

00:08:56.714 --> 00:08:57.255
with E. coli?

00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:04.324
AUDIENCE: We know that they have
a certain metabolic life cycle

00:09:04.324 --> 00:09:08.710
and that they exist in
different environments.

00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:09.486
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:09:09.486 --> 00:09:11.610
So that E. coli existent
in different environments.

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:13.401
And what environments
are you referring to?

00:09:13.401 --> 00:09:15.185
AUDIENCE: Gut and outside.

00:09:15.185 --> 00:09:16.310
PROFESSOR: Gut and outside.

00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:19.490
So if this is
true-- then what is

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:21.620
going to be your next
statement based on this?

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:25.103
AUDIENCE: Well, going
through mammalian guts

00:09:25.103 --> 00:09:28.967
there's always a certain
sequence of events.

00:09:28.967 --> 00:09:31.221
At the beginning, there's
some acid, and then

00:09:31.221 --> 00:09:33.095
less acid and more food,
and stuff like that.

00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:36.570
PROFESSOR: RIght.

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:40.340
So in the context of E.
coli, there's this idea

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:43.160
that part of the
life cycle of E. coli

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:46.005
and some other of
these microbes is

00:09:46.005 --> 00:09:49.850
to live inside the
gut of mammals.

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:51.625
And we're going to
focus in particular

00:09:51.625 --> 00:09:55.490
on this aspect, the part of the
life cycle that is in the gut.

00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:59.380
So let's just imagine, so E.
coli in gut or entering gut,

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:03.220
going through the gut,
they might encounter

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:06.700
some sort of typical
environmental cues,

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:10.740
or maybe orders of
environmental exposure.

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:13.680
And actually, even
before this paper,

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:20.530
there was another paper that was
published by Saeed Tavazoie--

00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:23.340
hard name to pronouce-- who
was at Princeton at the time.

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:25.950
So he had published a
Science paper just the year

00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:29.620
before-- well, couple years
before-- demonstrating

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:30.565
a related phenomenon.

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.880
What was it that this other
paper had demonstrated?

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:38.960
Does anybody remember
from the introduction?

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:41.090
So it wasn't the experiment
that these guys did.

00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:43.650
But in the
introduction they spent

00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:46.153
half of a paragraph describing
this other experiment.

00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:53.280
Another kind of
environmental cue

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:56.150
that E. coli get when
they enter the gut.

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:58.352
So what's-- yeah.

00:10:58.352 --> 00:11:02.280
AUDIENCE: Isn't there a
temperature increase and oxygen

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:02.960
decrease?

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:06.200
PROFESSOR: Temperature
increase and oxygen decrease.

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:14.420
So temperature goes up
and oxygen goes down.

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:16.190
And this makes sense.

00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:18.910
The inside of our
bodies typically

00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:20.160
warmer than outside our body.

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:22.500
Also, it's a relatively
anaerobic environment

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:25.510
inside the gut as compared
to the ready availability

00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:28.180
of oxygen outside.

00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:31.630
So what is it that this
other paper then showed?

00:11:47.399 --> 00:11:47.899
Yes.

00:11:47.899 --> 00:11:49.542
AUDIENCE: So I think
they were trying

00:11:49.542 --> 00:11:51.843
to show a symmetric
response [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:55.294 --> 00:11:57.759
If adaptation in one
situation occurred,

00:11:57.759 --> 00:12:02.689
then-- if it received
one stimulus,

00:12:02.689 --> 00:12:04.425
it would adapt to both.

00:12:04.425 --> 00:12:05.050
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:05.550
OK.

00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:08.110
And the word adapt, we always
have to be very careful,

00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:10.110
because it could mean two
very different things.

00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:13.360
And in some cases, it might
be that both-- possibly it

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:15.750
might be true, but when
you say that it receives

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:20.910
one stimuluss-- so
this we might call S1,

00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:24.820
and this is S2-- so these
are stimuli that the cell

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:28.356
senses-- are you saying
that it might sense one,

00:12:28.356 --> 00:12:29.480
and then it adapts to both.

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:31.800
When you say adapt,
are you referring

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:33.890
to evolutionary adaptation
or something else?

00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:35.884
AUDIENCE: I'm referring
to a single cell

00:12:35.884 --> 00:12:37.550
implementing the
appropriate metabolic--

00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:40.910
PROFESSOR: That sort of
cell level adaptation.

00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:43.080
The sort of default thing
is you might, say, well,

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:47.240
if you get the stimuli one
and increase the temperature,

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:52.240
you should implement the program
one or the response one that

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:57.220
corresponds to some set
of genes that are required

00:12:57.220 --> 00:13:00.670
to grow in high temperature.

00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:06.450
Now similarly with stimulus
2-- well, we'll say this is R2.

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:10.460
So these could, in principal,
have different gene network

00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:13.330
responses to these two
environmental changes.

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:16.280
But what they found is that
actually, if you take E. coli

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:19.240
and you expose it to
increase in temperature,

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:21.869
then not only does it
activate the genes required

00:13:21.869 --> 00:13:23.785
to handle high temperature,
but also activates

00:13:23.785 --> 00:13:29.902
the genes required handle
low oxygen, and vice versa.

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:35.290
Now there's a question, though.

00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:37.470
If you see this, it
could just be the case

00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:40.240
that you've mislabeled
what really is R1, R2.

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:43.670
Maybe it's just a single
R, single response

00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:45.910
that allows the population
to adapt to both

00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:49.737
of those environmental changes.

00:13:49.737 --> 00:13:51.320
Does anybody remember
what the authors

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:54.640
did to show that that was
maybe not what was going on?

00:14:10.247 --> 00:14:12.580
You can look at your sheet
of paper while I--I just want

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:16.740
to write down the reference
in case anybody wants to look

00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:17.500
at this more.

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:31.750
This is Tagkopoulos,
Science 2008.

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:33.590
What would you do if
you wanted to show

00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:36.780
that this was a real
regulatory strategy,

00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:40.960
this so-called symmetric
anticipatory regulation?

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:04.540
Yes.

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:06.294
AUDIENCE: Would it
be you could measure

00:15:06.294 --> 00:15:08.855
genes' pressure
somehow, and then you

00:15:08.855 --> 00:15:11.662
could get the function of each

00:15:11.662 --> 00:15:12.370
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:15.035
So you could expose
to this stimulus,

00:15:15.035 --> 00:15:17.660
measure gene expression, expose
to this stimulus, measures gene

00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:19.550
expression, and try
to figure out, maybe,

00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:21.850
based on the difference
which genes were more

00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:24.770
or less-- but the
argument was somehow

00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:30.510
that in response to stimulus
1, there were some genes that

00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:32.059
were really unnecessary.

00:15:32.059 --> 00:15:33.600
So I guess you could
go and you could

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:36.930
do knockouts of each
of these 100 genes,

00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:39.030
and then try to
measure the effects.

00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:42.655
And that would be
a nice direct--

00:15:42.655 --> 00:15:45.030
and it's related to something
that they did in this paper

00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:45.940
with the yeast.

00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:48.370
They went and looked at the
gene expression profiles.

00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:55.230
What they did in
this paper by Saeed

00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:58.350
was that they took
the E. coli that

00:15:58.350 --> 00:16:01.490
displayed this, what they're
arguing is a symmetric--

00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:04.470
and based on some
previous studies, I think,

00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:06.800
saying that, oh, this had
been annotated to be good

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:08.470
for temperature but not
for oxygen and vice versa.

00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:10.680
So there were already hints
that this kind of made sense.

00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:12.720
But what they did is they
evolved the populations

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:13.770
in just one of
these environments

00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:15.478
and showed that they
could decouple them.

00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:20.500
So that's at least
making you feel

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:25.740
that it's a little bit--
that maybe this was not

00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:28.692
due to just some sense that
it's the same genes that

00:16:28.692 --> 00:16:31.150
are required for protection
against these two environments,

00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:36.450
but rather that because they
had evolved in this environment

00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:38.660
where, when they see an
increase in temperature,

00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:42.324
they often see a
decrease in oxygen.

00:16:42.324 --> 00:16:43.824
AUDIENCE: So when
you say decoupled,

00:16:43.824 --> 00:16:48.050
you mean you evolve them in
high-temperature environments?

00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:49.319
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:16:49.319 --> 00:16:51.235
AUDIENCE: You expose
them to decreased oxygen,

00:16:51.235 --> 00:16:52.050
and then they die?

00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:53.133
PROFESSOR: No, no, no, no.

00:16:53.133 --> 00:16:56.420
So just, they showed that
if you evolve the population

00:16:56.420 --> 00:17:00.370
so that it receives this
stimulus without this stimulus,

00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:02.850
then it removes
this arrow, that it

00:17:02.850 --> 00:17:05.500
stops activating these genes.

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:07.500
And then I think
they also did look

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:08.815
at the functional consequences.

00:17:08.815 --> 00:17:10.190
But the first
order thing is just

00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:12.079
that they saw that
they could remove

00:17:12.079 --> 00:17:16.140
one of these arrows, which is
related to something that they

00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:18.930
do here as well.

00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:22.810
Now I think that
it's worth thinking

00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:27.690
about the question of
whether this study, published

00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:30.980
in Science in 2008,
do you think that it's

00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:34.530
a complete scoop of the
paper that you just read,

00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:43.880
which is Amir Mitchell's paper
published in Nature in 2009?

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:44.570
No.

00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:45.070
OK.

00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:46.819
And on one level you
say, well, they still

00:17:46.819 --> 00:17:51.250
got it published in Nature, so
therefore it was not a scoop.

00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:58.260
But I can tell you that
Amir was very worried,

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:02.260
because he had been working
on this paper for many years.

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:05.020
And they really studied
both E. coli and yeasts.

00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:06.590
It was a major thing.

00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:08.850
And then this paper
came out, and I'm

00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:11.260
sure that he was despondent.

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:12.874
And there will be
times where you

00:18:12.874 --> 00:18:14.540
feel despondent as a
result of something

00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:17.990
like this coming out, because it
really is a very similar idea.

00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:20.850
The E. coli stuff
is very similar,

00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:27.200
because it's same organism--
the idea is, in the gut.

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:30.024
So in what ways do you think
that their paper is different,

00:18:30.024 --> 00:18:31.440
and also, what
strategies did they

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:34.370
follow in order to
differentiate their paper?

00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:38.296
Yeah.

00:18:38.296 --> 00:18:40.810
AUDIENCE: Maybe
potentially trying

00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:46.205
to find differing regulation
mechanisms, so they said, well,

00:18:46.205 --> 00:18:48.065
there's a symmetric
regulation mechanism

00:18:48.065 --> 00:18:49.565
that someone talked
about last year,

00:18:49.565 --> 00:18:51.990
and we've got the
asymmetric one.

00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:52.990
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:56.620
And I think that
this is-- of course,

00:18:56.620 --> 00:18:58.860
we cannot replay history.

00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:03.410
But I think that they do a
very nice thing in figure one

00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:07.370
of laying the groundwork
to make it very clear

00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:10.150
that their work is
different from Saeed's work.

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:13.740
And the thing is that if
this had not been published,

00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:16.840
they maybe would have framed
their work differently.

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:18.870
They might not have
had this difference

00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:20.940
between a symmetrical
anticipatory regulation

00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:23.310
and the asymmetrical.

00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:25.850
But by laying
things out that way,

00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:28.200
it clarifies that, oh yeah,
these are different things.

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:30.580
And they're going
to explore this one,

00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:33.240
whereas Saeed's
group had explored

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:34.672
a rather different mechanism.

00:19:34.672 --> 00:19:36.880
But then, of course, depending
on how you look at it,

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:38.379
they're either more
or less similar.

00:19:38.379 --> 00:19:41.140
But I think that they do a
very nice job of kind of right

00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:43.154
at the beginning setting
out how their work is

00:19:43.154 --> 00:19:44.070
going to be different.

00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:52.720
So they explained that there's
the simple direct sensing

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:54.720
mechanisms.

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:59.370
You'd say that you just
have different stimuli that

00:19:59.370 --> 00:20:01.080
lead to different responses.

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:02.354
That's fine.

00:20:02.354 --> 00:20:04.270
They also have the
stochastic switching, which

00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:05.561
we're going to talk about more.

00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:12.540
The idea here is
that even though we

00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:16.582
might be getting different
stimuli at some rates,

00:20:16.582 --> 00:20:18.790
we would still switch into
these different responses.

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:25.000
And we'll talk about various
reasons that this might happen.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.541
Incidentally, these
things don't have

00:20:26.541 --> 00:20:28.070
to happen at the same rates.

00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:31.570
So it could be that stimulus
one it primarily does R1,

00:20:31.570 --> 00:20:35.250
whereas stimulus 2 primarily
does R2, for example.

00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:37.985
If you'd like, these arrows
could have different strengths.

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:43.380
But then what they do is they
point out that there really

00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:48.572
are-- well, this symmetric
anticipatory regulation,

00:20:48.572 --> 00:20:50.030
where it's crossed,
maybe I'll just

00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:51.238
write out the asymmetric one.

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:06.670
Can somebody say
why it is that we

00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:09.350
might want to do the
asymmetrical as compared

00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:10.645
to the symmetrical?

00:21:30.425 --> 00:21:32.900
Yes.

00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:36.860
AUDIENCE: If both of the stimuli
are appearing at the same time,

00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:39.335
then you might want to have
a symmetric anticipatory

00:21:39.335 --> 00:21:40.322
regulation?

00:21:40.322 --> 00:21:41.030
PROFESSOR: Great.

00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:42.770
So the important thin
is here that this

00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:47.055
is, because it's at the same
time, the two stimuli kind

00:21:47.055 --> 00:21:53.230
of come together, or very
similar times, whereas this,

00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:55.330
if there's a clear
temporal order.

00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:01.030
But you could think about
this in some other way

00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:02.090
as well, maybe.

00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:02.850
Can somebody--

00:22:10.261 --> 00:22:11.760
AUDIENCE: It's along
the same lines,

00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:17.070
but there's a cost to
having S2 also performing.

00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:18.195
Then if you ever use that--

00:22:21.162 --> 00:22:21.870
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:23.450
So depending on
the costs, it could

00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:28.540
change what's sort of
optimal, perhaps, right?

00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:30.700
And I think it's also
perhaps worth just saying

00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:32.520
that it may also depend
upon how frequent

00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:34.520
these different environmental
perturbations are,

00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:36.630
because you can also
imagine situations

00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:43.470
where it's very common that
the temperature goes up,

00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:46.180
but it's very rare
that oxygen goes down.

00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:50.431
But there could be a sense
in which this is, basically,

00:22:50.431 --> 00:22:51.930
based on the logic
I just said, this

00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:53.806
would be then less
predictive of this

00:22:53.806 --> 00:22:54.930
than this would be of this.

00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:56.450
Do you guys see what I'm saying?

00:22:56.450 --> 00:22:58.908
Because it could be the case
that any time that oxygen goes

00:22:58.908 --> 00:23:01.810
down, then you really know that
that means that you're entering

00:23:01.810 --> 00:23:04.740
somebody's gut and you
also better activate this,

00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:07.340
whereas it could also be
the case that if you sit out

00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:09.190
in the sun, you get
hot, it doesn't mean

00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:10.481
that oxygen's going to go down.

00:23:10.481 --> 00:23:13.750
So it could be that there
is more or less information,

00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:16.380
or that each of the stimuli
have more or less information

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:17.590
about another stimuli.

00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:19.950
So even if there's
no temporal order,

00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:22.900
it could be the case
that something like that

00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:26.010
could lead to a situation
where this might be optimal.

00:23:29.164 --> 00:23:33.625
AUDIENCE: So it seems
people try to make

00:23:33.625 --> 00:23:37.485
formal statements about
information in this context,

00:23:37.485 --> 00:23:40.275
just like they did in the
context of stochastic theory.

00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:45.990
PROFESSOR: So
there's some of it.

00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:48.280
I haven't seen anything
that's quite as

00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:51.740
clear and formal as what Edo
Kussell did in that Science

00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:53.070
paper you guys just read.

00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:56.250
But for example,
Amir did do a paper,

00:23:56.250 --> 00:24:00.600
he wrote a PNAS paper basically
laying out this model that's

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:03.520
sort of sketched at the end
of this paper a little bit

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:05.830
in more detail in
terms of explaining,

00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:08.310
depending on the probability
that something occurs

00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:10.020
and the time, so
kind of exploring

00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:11.680
this a bit more,
but not as formal

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:14.645
in terms of information as--

00:24:14.645 --> 00:24:16.270
AUDIENCE: So it's
not quite clear to me

00:24:16.270 --> 00:24:20.680
why you would have a symmetric
anticipatory regulation

00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:23.130
comparing direct sensing.

00:24:23.130 --> 00:24:28.070
If you have direct sensing,
you can do the same thing.

00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:29.610
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:30.360
I think it's true.

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:33.730
But it could also be that
because these things are

00:24:33.730 --> 00:24:37.940
both fluctuating and
they are measured

00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:41.922
with some noise and
the environment,

00:24:41.922 --> 00:24:44.130
there could be a sense that--
because you can imagine

00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:46.880
a world in which
these two things are

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:50.210
both uncertain predictors of
whether you're in the gut.

00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:52.690
But if they both
go, then that really

00:24:52.690 --> 00:24:58.620
means something, in which
case then it would make sense

00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:03.120
to really look at both of them
and activate both more strongly

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:05.390
as a result of seeing both.

00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:07.186
AUDIENCE: But it
could also make you

00:25:07.186 --> 00:25:09.800
more susceptible to
trigger a response that you

00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:11.760
don't necessarily want.

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:12.890
PROFESSOR: That's true.

00:25:12.890 --> 00:25:16.420
But if you say, oh, well
this happens at a low rate

00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:17.920
and this happens
at a low rate, then

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:20.720
the probability that both of
them happen at the same time

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:21.850
would be very small.

00:25:21.850 --> 00:25:24.120
So your rate of false
positive, in that sense,

00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:27.760
would be-- you can really reduce
the rate of false positives

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:29.790
by integrating both
pieces of information.

00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:40.980
And this paper, just
to remind ourselves,

00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:42.980
this paper is
primarily exploring

00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:46.280
the idea of asymmetrical
anticipatory regulation.

00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:48.340
And their argument
is because there's

00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:54.420
a typical temporal order to
how E. Coli that are ingested

00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:57.640
encounter different sugar.

00:25:57.640 --> 00:26:02.560
And the claim in the paper is
that bacteria will typically

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:04.060
see what before what?

00:26:11.365 --> 00:26:12.826
AUDIENCE: Lactose
before maltose.

00:26:12.826 --> 00:26:13.617
PROFESSOR: Correct.

00:26:13.617 --> 00:26:18.660
So the claim is that in the gut,
the bacteria will see lactose

00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:22.170
before they see maltose.

00:26:22.170 --> 00:26:25.880
Now in order to evolve this
asymmetrical anticipatory

00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:30.812
regulation, does it have to
be that you kind of always

00:26:30.812 --> 00:26:32.270
see lactose before
you see maltose?

00:26:39.730 --> 00:26:43.450
So let's imagine that only 10%
of the time that the bacteria

00:26:43.450 --> 00:26:46.550
see lactose-- or sorry,
only 10% of the time

00:26:46.550 --> 00:26:49.540
that the bacteria encounter
maltose that they actually saw

00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:50.420
lactose before.

00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:56.010
Since 10% is much less
than 1, should that totally

00:26:56.010 --> 00:26:59.070
scotch this whole mechanism?

00:26:59.070 --> 00:26:59.570
No.

00:26:59.570 --> 00:27:01.880
And can you say why not?

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:04.750
AUDIENCE: Every time they
see lactose they see maltose.

00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:05.750
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:07.910
In some ways, that's
not the right way

00:27:07.910 --> 00:27:12.840
to think about it, but in
terms of a cost-benefit type

00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:16.400
argument, why is it that
maybe it's OK in principle

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:19.220
that maltose is frequently
observed without lactose?

00:27:25.891 --> 00:27:28.326
AUDIENCE: There's no difference
between the two strains

00:27:28.326 --> 00:27:30.032
if you see maltose that way.

00:27:30.032 --> 00:27:30.740
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:33.440
And I think this is a kind of
an interesting, important point,

00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:37.180
which is that if you imagine a
competition between the strain

00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:41.360
that just does, we can imagine,
direct sensing versus we'll

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:42.440
call that AAR.

00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:49.090
So direct sensing versus
asymmetrical anticipatory

00:27:49.090 --> 00:27:50.180
regulation.

00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:56.110
Now if you imagine the
situation where you encounter

00:27:56.110 --> 00:27:59.350
maltose without encountering
lactose, then these two

00:27:59.350 --> 00:28:02.516
strategies behave
essentially identically,

00:28:02.516 --> 00:28:04.140
because they both
just see the maltose,

00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:05.650
they're both surprised.

00:28:05.650 --> 00:28:08.080
They both activate the mall
genes, everything's fine.

00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:12.540
However, it's in
this other direction

00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:13.873
that you have to think about it.

00:28:13.873 --> 00:28:16.420
So the real question is,
when you encounter lactose,

00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:19.230
you want to think about, well,
what fraction of the time

00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:23.220
and how long a delay is there
before you encounter maltose?

00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:28.270
Because if it's the case that
you encounter lactose a lot,

00:28:28.270 --> 00:28:32.140
and only infrequently do
you then come on to maltose,

00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:34.090
that's going to be a
problem for evolving this

00:28:34.090 --> 00:28:36.190
into asymmetrical
anticipatory regulation,

00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:38.900
or it would not necessarily
be optimal to do so,

00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:41.190
because in that case you're
going to be activating

00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:45.150
all those mall genes in
advance, and frequently it

00:28:45.150 --> 00:28:45.920
won't be useful.

00:28:49.690 --> 00:28:54.730
And this is relevant, perhaps,
just because what fraction

00:28:54.730 --> 00:28:58.112
of the time do you think
that E. coli going to the gut

00:28:58.112 --> 00:28:59.070
will encounter lactose?

00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:13.840
We should be able to make a
reasonable estimate of this,

00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:14.620
is my claim.

00:29:22.330 --> 00:29:22.830
All right.

00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:25.360
Where does lactose come from?

00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:28.160
Lactose comes from milk.

00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:37.800
Which animals drink milk?

00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:41.690
Well, right, OK.

00:29:41.690 --> 00:29:43.110
So we're thinking about mammals.

00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:46.142
Just take a random
mammal of your choice.

00:29:46.142 --> 00:29:47.600
You might want to
not choose humans

00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:50.020
just because we're a little
bit atypical in this regard,

00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:51.970
although even there
I think the numbers

00:29:51.970 --> 00:29:53.220
end up being kind of the same.

00:29:53.220 --> 00:30:03.680
But imagine a dog or a bear
or your favorite mammal.

00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:06.890
Which of them are drinking milk?

00:30:06.890 --> 00:30:07.740
The young, right?

00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:08.239
OK.

00:30:08.239 --> 00:30:12.190
So there's some period of one's
life where you drink milk,

00:30:12.190 --> 00:30:15.000
and then as an adult
you typically don't.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.290
I guess all I'm
saying is that if you

00:30:17.290 --> 00:30:20.960
imagine the bacteria entering
into a mammalian gut,

00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:23.350
it might be 20%.

00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:26.560
I don't know what,
but it's basically

00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:27.730
proportional to the years.

00:30:27.730 --> 00:30:31.080
The kids, they may
eat more dirty things.

00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:32.890
So you have to wait or whatever.

00:30:32.890 --> 00:30:35.970
The point is that they're
going to encounter lactose

00:30:35.970 --> 00:30:41.650
if they enter the gut of
a baby or young child,

00:30:41.650 --> 00:30:45.260
whereas if you enter an adult,
then you won't see lactose,

00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:48.650
and you'll just maybe then
directly see the maltose.

00:30:48.650 --> 00:30:50.670
But there's no real
cost associated

00:30:50.670 --> 00:30:52.910
with missing that
signal vis a vis

00:30:52.910 --> 00:30:54.160
the so-called direct strategy.

00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:06.715
I think that they do lay out
some other kind of conditions

00:31:06.715 --> 00:31:10.560
that they think would be
reasonable to demonstrate

00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:15.830
if you want to do the
asymmetrical anticipatory

00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:17.370
regulation.

00:31:17.370 --> 00:31:22.010
And once again, I think
that this is both very clear

00:31:22.010 --> 00:31:23.440
and also just lays
the groundwork

00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:26.310
for the reader in the
sense that they tell you

00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:29.460
what they would need to show in
order for you to be convinced.

00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:31.960
And then they go and
they do those things.

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:34.330
Now in principle,
you could argue

00:31:34.330 --> 00:31:35.700
about one or the other things.

00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:37.570
But I think they
do such a nice job

00:31:37.570 --> 00:31:40.400
of being clear about what would
be needed that you don't even

00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:42.291
think to object about any of it.

00:31:42.291 --> 00:31:44.790
And of course they're not going
to bring up the three things

00:31:44.790 --> 00:31:45.940
that they would
need to demonstrate

00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:48.315
unless they actually were able
to demonstrate those three

00:31:48.315 --> 00:31:49.470
things.

00:31:49.470 --> 00:31:51.720
So the three things
that they claim

00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:58.810
is that for this to have been an
evolved trait that pre-exposure

00:31:58.810 --> 00:32:08.180
to S1 increases the
fitness under S2 or R2--

00:32:08.180 --> 00:32:11.660
I guess in this
case-- that's right.

00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:14.840
So getting S1 helps you in S2.

00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:17.504
So seeing lactose
helps you in maltose.

00:32:17.504 --> 00:32:18.920
Indeed they're
going to show that.

00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:25.780
Second, that there's
some cost associated

00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:29.170
with up regulating
that, in this case

00:32:29.170 --> 00:32:31.990
up regulating the mall genes.

00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:35.600
And third, there's this
idea of specificity.

00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:39.110
Now the claim is
that it's really

00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:41.710
S1 that is activating
this R2 response,

00:32:41.710 --> 00:32:45.010
and that various other S's, in
this case other sugar sources,

00:32:45.010 --> 00:32:46.790
maybe should not pre-activate.

00:32:56.260 --> 00:32:59.120
Now in figure 1,
they basically are

00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:05.950
exploring the difference
between this arrow and this one.

00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:08.710
So if you expose
the cells to maltose

00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:12.370
you activate the mall
genes at a high level.

00:33:12.370 --> 00:33:15.030
Is it required that
exposure to lactose up

00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:20.570
regulates the mall genes to
the same level as maltose?

00:33:20.570 --> 00:33:21.440
No.

00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:23.273
Was it at the same
level as maltose?

00:33:23.273 --> 00:33:23.772
No.

00:33:26.570 --> 00:33:29.750
But the idea is it up
regulates it some, as compared

00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:31.340
to other carbon sources.

00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:50.520
Now they also made a comment
about whether this arrow,

00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:53.010
the so-called
anticipatory regulation,

00:33:53.010 --> 00:33:55.010
whether it was specific
to their E. coli strain,

00:33:55.010 --> 00:33:57.195
and their claim was
that it was or was not?

00:34:03.349 --> 00:34:05.640
Would it be good for it to
be specific to their strain,

00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:06.140
or bad?

00:34:08.620 --> 00:34:12.580
Probably bad, although the
fact that-- but then they

00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:16.290
say, oh, it's not
specific to our strain.

00:34:16.290 --> 00:34:20.150
And then they cite another
paper, which-- and this

00:34:20.150 --> 00:34:21.650
is, again, a nice
way of phrasing

00:34:21.650 --> 00:34:25.082
it because they're adding
strength to their paper

00:34:25.082 --> 00:34:27.290
because they're saying, oh,
it's not just our strain.

00:34:27.290 --> 00:34:29.030
It's in other strains as well.

00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:31.567
So you read that sentence
and say yes, that's good.

00:34:31.567 --> 00:34:33.150
Of course you could
read that sentence

00:34:33.150 --> 00:34:36.290
and say, oh, but somebody
else already showed this?

00:34:36.290 --> 00:34:40.440
But this is, again--
and I don't have

00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:43.650
any real complaint about that,
because I think what they've

00:34:43.650 --> 00:34:47.020
done is they've really
brought a set of measurements

00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:49.110
together in one
conceptual framework

00:34:49.110 --> 00:34:52.260
that I think is
rather compelling.

00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:53.969
Now of course, you
can always argue about

00:34:53.969 --> 00:34:55.780
whether each of
these examples really

00:34:55.780 --> 00:34:58.460
did evolve for this purpose
or not and so forth.

00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:00.190
But just because
somebody else had

00:35:00.190 --> 00:35:03.810
seen that there was some
cross-regulation of the mall

00:35:03.810 --> 00:35:05.091
genes in response to lactose.

00:35:05.091 --> 00:35:06.840
Doesn't mean that this
paper is worthless.

00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:14.460
But it is interesting to note
that somebody else had already

00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:14.960
seen this.

00:35:18.110 --> 00:35:21.610
Moreover, in figure
one they compare

00:35:21.610 --> 00:35:27.310
this asymmetrical anticipatory
regulation for their wild type

00:35:27.310 --> 00:35:29.182
strain as compared
to another strain.

00:35:29.182 --> 00:35:30.640
And what other
strain did they use?

00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:38.580
Yes.

00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:43.680
AUDIENCE: You didn't
expose the cells to maltose

00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:44.962
after the lactose [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:44.962 --> 00:35:45.670
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:51.550
They evolved the cells in
lactose for 500 generations.

00:35:54.345 --> 00:35:55.470
And then what did they see?

00:36:00.915 --> 00:36:01.910
AUDIENCE: The arrow.

00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:02.910
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:36:02.910 --> 00:36:06.890
When they saw was that
evolution-- and this

00:36:06.890 --> 00:36:13.110
is in lactose-- removed that.

00:36:16.910 --> 00:36:19.485
Now 500 generations,
how long do you think

00:36:19.485 --> 00:36:20.610
this is going to take them?

00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:28.900
AUDIENCE: A few months.

00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:29.900
PROFESSOR: A few months.

00:36:33.090 --> 00:36:34.900
Have you guys ever
heard of any other paper

00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:43.540
where they evolved E. coli in
lactose for 500 generations

00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:45.590
in your extensive
reading of the literature

00:36:45.590 --> 00:36:47.425
that you've engaged
in over this semester?

00:36:53.231 --> 00:36:54.710
AUDIENCE: The
cost-benefit paper.

00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:57.450
PROFESSOR: The
cost-benefit paper.

00:36:57.450 --> 00:37:02.230
So it's fascinating to note
that this sentence, they said,

00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:04.520
"We have examined
laboratory-evolved strains

00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:06.180
of E. coli.

00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:08.780
Did they say that they
did the evolution?

00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:10.680
No, they didn't.

00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:16.440
And indeed, if you follow
Citation 14 over here,

00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:19.760
you can say, oh, right.

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:24.790
So it's another paper
by Uri and company.

00:37:24.790 --> 00:37:27.430
So I don't know if it was
the exact same experiment,

00:37:27.430 --> 00:37:29.940
but the idea is
that-- so I think

00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:32.070
what they did is, they
took the strains that

00:37:32.070 --> 00:37:34.440
were evolved for another
purpose, and that's fine.

00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:37.790
If somebody else already
did the daily dilutions

00:37:37.790 --> 00:37:40.330
for three months that is the
exact same that you were going

00:37:40.330 --> 00:37:42.640
to do, then you
might as well just

00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:44.310
analyze their evolved
strains, right?

00:37:44.310 --> 00:37:47.530
There's nothing that says you
have to go and repeat the work.

00:37:47.530 --> 00:37:50.150
You would get the same
thing, maybe, presumably.

00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:51.750
So this is just
worth highlighting.

00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:53.330
But it makes the
paper much stronger

00:37:53.330 --> 00:37:54.960
that they were able to do that.

00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:57.760
So it's good to keep in mind
that in some cases, what you

00:37:57.760 --> 00:38:01.120
need to do to make your
point has already been done

00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:02.920
or has already been
evolved and so forth.

00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:04.560
So now what we
have is a situation

00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:07.950
where somebody else,
maybe, has already seen

00:38:07.950 --> 00:38:11.610
that lactose activates maltose.

00:38:11.610 --> 00:38:14.730
Somebody else already did
this evolution on lactose.

00:38:14.730 --> 00:38:18.340
They didn't yet show that
this regulation was removed.

00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:20.340
So that was something
that these guys had to do,

00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:23.150
and indeed, it looks
like it's removed.

00:38:23.150 --> 00:38:27.820
But once again, I think there's
a sense that they're really

00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:30.570
looking at this problem
from kind of a new, maybe

00:38:30.570 --> 00:38:32.219
comprehensive way
that allows them

00:38:32.219 --> 00:38:33.635
to see the connections
between all

00:38:33.635 --> 00:38:34.801
these different experiments.

00:38:34.801 --> 00:38:36.830
And then they are
doing new measurements.

00:38:36.830 --> 00:38:39.590
But the measurements themselves
are perhaps relatively simple,

00:38:39.590 --> 00:38:41.160
but the trick is knowing
what measurements

00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:42.690
you need to do in
order to say something

00:38:42.690 --> 00:38:43.689
that's very interesting.

00:38:52.610 --> 00:38:55.060
So in figure three, what
they went and they did is

00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:57.310
they asked about this question
of whether there really

00:38:57.310 --> 00:39:01.260
is a fitness benefit
associated with it.

00:39:01.260 --> 00:39:04.120
Now I think this is
another case where

00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:07.450
you could have made this
figure in the form of a table,

00:39:07.450 --> 00:39:11.074
and it just would not
be very compelling.

00:39:11.074 --> 00:39:13.740
So you'd look at it and you just
wouldn't be very excited by it,

00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:17.440
whereas in this case, they
have the figure, which

00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:20.550
are these fitness advantages
associated with whether you

00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:23.290
take the strains, you first
expose them to lactose and then

00:39:23.290 --> 00:39:25.360
go to maltose, or
you go from maltose

00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:29.810
to lactose, or in this case GAL
to maltose, sucrose to maltose.

00:39:29.810 --> 00:39:34.500
What they showed was it was
a selective benefit there,

00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:38.870
that the cells really only gain
the benefit of pre-exposure

00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:41.680
to a sugar if it's lactose.

00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:46.690
And they show that for
the evolved strain,

00:39:46.690 --> 00:39:48.730
not only does it no
longer have that arrow

00:39:48.730 --> 00:39:51.280
in the sense of the response,
but it also no longer

00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:52.100
has the benefit.

00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:53.850
It's good to do both
of those measurements

00:39:53.850 --> 00:39:56.583
because it's possible you
might have missed something.

00:39:56.583 --> 00:39:57.083
Yeah.

00:39:57.083 --> 00:40:00.265
AUDIENCE: So but like, it's for
one protocol going from lactose

00:40:00.265 --> 00:40:01.090
to maltose.

00:40:01.090 --> 00:40:02.090
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:05.940
Yep.

00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:09.532
And this is the
nature of science,

00:40:09.532 --> 00:40:11.490
or in particular this
kind of science, I think,

00:40:11.490 --> 00:40:17.150
that you can
collect data that is

00:40:17.150 --> 00:40:19.380
consistent with
this interpretation,

00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:24.020
but it does not at all prove
that this is not gut, either.

00:40:27.550 --> 00:40:30.260
And so you could have
imagined experiments

00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:33.230
where you maybe mixed
two strains that

00:40:33.230 --> 00:40:36.270
follow this direct
versus the AAR,

00:40:36.270 --> 00:40:39.230
and you mix them together
50-50 in the gut.

00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:41.310
And then you go and you
do sequencing later.

00:40:41.310 --> 00:40:43.690
And actually, people do
such kinds of experiments,

00:40:43.690 --> 00:40:48.820
and in some cases, amazingly,
sometimes something

00:40:48.820 --> 00:40:52.562
comes out the other end
that is interesting.

00:40:52.562 --> 00:40:53.520
I couldn't help myself.

00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:54.228
Sorry about that.

00:40:57.210 --> 00:40:59.040
So yes.

00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:03.270
One other point on this
paper, or this figure,

00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:06.390
that they even color
code the data points.

00:41:06.390 --> 00:41:08.880
So they have their main
thing in this black,

00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:13.190
but then the other ones
are red, yellow, blue.

00:41:13.190 --> 00:41:18.480
it's telling us that this
thing is directional.

00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:23.160
It's S1, S2, S2, S1,
specificity, extinction.

00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:25.790
So they are even
kind of telling us

00:41:25.790 --> 00:41:28.190
what each of those
data points mean.

00:41:28.190 --> 00:41:30.570
And you might say, oh,
that's kind of overkill.

00:41:30.570 --> 00:41:33.660
But given that it's just
so important that you're

00:41:33.660 --> 00:41:37.051
keeping track of why we're
doing each of these measurements

00:41:37.051 --> 00:41:39.300
and what it's supposed to
tell us about the big story,

00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:43.810
I think that it's really just
wonderful to be reminded,

00:41:43.810 --> 00:41:51.410
OK, what is this controlling
for, or what not.

00:41:51.410 --> 00:41:52.648
Yes.

00:41:52.648 --> 00:41:53.680
AUDIENCE: I like the colors
too, but they don't stand out

00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:54.888
very well in black and white.

00:41:57.240 --> 00:41:59.040
PROFESSOR: Yes, well, OK.

00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:02.930
So we can lead entire
discussions about both

00:42:02.930 --> 00:42:05.050
how to write a paper
and how to read a paper.

00:42:05.050 --> 00:42:07.410
How to read a paper is
that you should just

00:42:07.410 --> 00:42:08.960
get a color printer, OK?

00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:10.460
So that's the advice.

00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:11.890
In terms of how
to write a paper,

00:42:11.890 --> 00:42:13.790
I would say, though,
that it's always

00:42:13.790 --> 00:42:17.420
good-- you should take
advantage of colors,

00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:20.740
but you should choose the
color scheme/scale such

00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:24.557
that it is legible or
compelling in both color

00:42:24.557 --> 00:42:25.390
and black and white.

00:42:25.390 --> 00:42:27.440
And actually there's
a very nice set

00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:34.339
of articles written by Wong,
who's a graphic artist that

00:42:34.339 --> 00:42:35.130
works at the Broad.

00:42:35.130 --> 00:42:39.174
He wrote maybe 15 different kind
of one- or two-page articles

00:42:39.174 --> 00:42:40.590
for Nature Methods,
basically just

00:42:40.590 --> 00:42:41.714
about how to write figures.

00:42:41.714 --> 00:42:43.800
And he talks about these
different color scales.

00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:47.990
You know, there's-- what
do the words mean when

00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:50.670
there's brightness?

00:42:50.670 --> 00:42:51.844
Color, hue, saturation.

00:42:51.844 --> 00:42:54.010
I can't remember what all
these things mean anymore.

00:42:54.010 --> 00:42:56.700
But that's why you
should read the articles.

00:42:56.700 --> 00:42:59.456
And it's fascinating
stuff, actually.

00:43:06.820 --> 00:43:10.120
So this is the basic argument
they made in this paper,

00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:14.830
that because E. coli are exposed
to a typical order of carbon

00:43:14.830 --> 00:43:19.510
sources in the mammalian
gut, that that's

00:43:19.510 --> 00:43:22.375
the possible explanation for
why this thing evolved that they

00:43:22.375 --> 00:43:23.750
can measure
experimentally, which

00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:26.890
is that when, these E.
coli, they see lactose,

00:43:26.890 --> 00:43:30.000
they start activating the
mall genes but not vice versa.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.720
Now, like always,
you can't prove

00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:35.280
that this is what's going on.

00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:37.740
I think very interesting
set of ideas.

00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:41.640
Some of the people that
study gut microbes just

00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:45.390
think that it's implausible that
this would actually work out

00:43:45.390 --> 00:43:47.920
in the sense that the fitness
cost benefits, et cetera,

00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:49.704
would be relevant.

00:43:49.704 --> 00:43:51.620
Do we know that the time
scales even work out?

00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:54.200
I don't know how-- so
there are a bunch of things

00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:56.350
that you could worry about.

00:43:56.350 --> 00:43:58.320
And I would say I don't
know enough about what

00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:01.580
goes on in the gut to
actually have an educated

00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:02.680
opinion on that point.

00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:08.200
But I think it's a very kind of
clear exposition of the ideas.

00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:09.676
Yeah.

00:44:09.676 --> 00:44:11.644
AUDIENCE: Do you
have a sense for what

00:44:11.644 --> 00:44:19.024
fraction of E. coli bacteria
are in the gut of animals?

00:44:19.024 --> 00:44:20.008
Do you see what I mean?

00:44:20.008 --> 00:44:22.000
Because it's just a
very small fraction.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:23.000
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:26.930
Yeah, and I guess--
so I myself definitely

00:44:26.930 --> 00:44:29.470
do not know what fraction
of E.coli are in the gut as

00:44:29.470 --> 00:44:31.712
compared to in the
soil or in the--

00:44:31.712 --> 00:44:34.170
it's not that E. coli are the
dominant bacteria in our gut,

00:44:34.170 --> 00:44:34.730
either.

00:44:34.730 --> 00:44:39.250
It's just that they do
enter the gut at some rate.

00:44:39.250 --> 00:44:42.670
And then the question is,
if we knew the answer,

00:44:42.670 --> 00:44:45.852
I don't even know if it
would tell us-- I mean,

00:44:45.852 --> 00:44:46.810
it gives some guidance.

00:44:46.810 --> 00:44:48.470
But there's also a
question of where

00:44:48.470 --> 00:44:50.220
is it that cells are
actually dividing,

00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:52.610
because it could be the
case that the life cycle is

00:44:52.610 --> 00:44:54.370
that they go in the
gut, and that's where

00:44:54.370 --> 00:44:55.540
they're dividing and happy.

00:44:55.540 --> 00:44:58.560
And then they end up
in some soil somewhere,

00:44:58.560 --> 00:45:02.000
and they're in some stationary
phase, and maybe most of them

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:03.870
are dying at some small rate.

00:45:03.870 --> 00:45:05.690
Eventually some of
them get uptaken again

00:45:05.690 --> 00:45:07.231
and then they divide,
divide, divide.

00:45:07.231 --> 00:45:10.730
So it could be the cases that
only 0.1% of all E. coli,

00:45:10.730 --> 00:45:11.980
or 01% of the time.

00:45:11.980 --> 00:45:13.520
It could be a very small
amount of time or something,

00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:15.269
and they're in the
gut, but it could still

00:45:15.269 --> 00:45:20.610
be the dominant
event in their lives.

00:45:20.610 --> 00:45:21.667
So I just don't know.

00:45:25.010 --> 00:45:29.190
I think I'm maybe going to skip
the second half of the talk,

00:45:29.190 --> 00:45:31.480
or second half of the
paper, where they discuss

00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:37.930
this idea of the typical
order of events in which yeast

00:45:37.930 --> 00:45:41.380
in the context of
fermentation and making wine

00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:44.231
might encounter or experience
different environmental

00:45:44.231 --> 00:45:44.730
assaults.

00:45:44.730 --> 00:45:46.854
And it's a similar kind of
idea of cross-protection

00:45:46.854 --> 00:45:49.405
against different assaults.

00:45:49.405 --> 00:45:52.070
But in some ways,
this is really sort

00:45:52.070 --> 00:45:56.210
of two mini-papers
that tie together

00:45:56.210 --> 00:46:00.480
in this general thing of
anticipatory regulation.

00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:04.540
Are there any questions
about this before we move on?

00:46:08.977 --> 00:46:09.963
Yes.

00:46:09.963 --> 00:46:13.003
AUDIENCE: I have a
question about when

00:46:13.003 --> 00:46:15.206
the baby males grow up.

00:46:15.206 --> 00:46:16.372
Do they need this mechanism?

00:46:19.330 --> 00:46:22.207
Do E. coli?

00:46:22.207 --> 00:46:22.790
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:46:22.790 --> 00:46:27.310
So your question is whether
E. coli in the gut of adults

00:46:27.310 --> 00:46:30.280
have this.

00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:37.720
I don't know, but my feeling is
that these things are probably

00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:42.220
fairly transient in the
sense that you probably

00:46:42.220 --> 00:46:47.180
don't have-- well, certainly,
from the standpoint of entering

00:46:47.180 --> 00:46:49.460
the gut, the bacteria
don't have any choice

00:46:49.460 --> 00:46:50.620
about whose gut they enter.

00:46:50.620 --> 00:46:52.870
So it probably is going
to be the case that they

00:46:52.870 --> 00:46:54.560
have to have a
basic strategy that

00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:58.850
is going to work across
both adults and the kids,

00:46:58.850 --> 00:47:01.890
although it's true that
the gut communities in kids

00:47:01.890 --> 00:47:03.550
are different from adults.

00:47:03.550 --> 00:47:06.037
But it's hard to know
what to make of that.

00:47:06.037 --> 00:47:06.975
Yeah.

00:47:06.975 --> 00:47:12.300
AUDIENCE: So here they
decouple the two responses.

00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:16.644
Are there any examples of
researchers coupling them,

00:47:16.644 --> 00:47:17.550
like Pavlov's?

00:47:17.550 --> 00:47:18.670
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:47:18.670 --> 00:47:20.258
That's a good question.

00:47:20.258 --> 00:47:22.216
I know that I've heard
people talking about it,

00:47:22.216 --> 00:47:24.300
but I can't point to
a specific example

00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:27.883
of where it's been convincing.

00:47:27.883 --> 00:47:29.758
That doesn't mean it's
not out there, though.

00:47:33.620 --> 00:47:35.686
It's a very important,
interesting question.

00:47:43.284 --> 00:47:45.200
So what we want to now
is kind of switch gears

00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:48.984
a little bit and switch
to this topic of-- it's

00:47:48.984 --> 00:47:51.400
going to be kind of partly
about phenotypic heterogeneity,

00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:54.660
but partly again about
fluctuating environments.

00:47:54.660 --> 00:47:57.010
And the way that those
two topics are related

00:47:57.010 --> 00:47:58.910
is via bet hedging,
but I just want

00:47:58.910 --> 00:48:04.470
to highlight that bet
hedging is a way of using

00:48:04.470 --> 00:48:08.220
phenotypic heterogeneity in
order to survive fluctuating

00:48:08.220 --> 00:48:12.024
environments, whereas it's
not the only explanation

00:48:12.024 --> 00:48:13.440
for this phenotypic
heterogeneity.

00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:34.940
So yeah, I think maybe
we'll-- so first of all,

00:48:34.940 --> 00:48:39.750
on the topic of
phenotypic heterogeneity,

00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:44.260
when we say that we are often
referring to the fact that even

00:48:44.260 --> 00:48:47.430
clonal populations can be
remarkably heterogeneous

00:48:47.430 --> 00:48:48.710
in a given environment.

00:48:48.710 --> 00:48:50.480
So we'll say phenotypic
heterogeneity

00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:55.397
in clonal populations,
because of course,

00:48:55.397 --> 00:48:57.730
if there's a lot of genetic
diversity in the population,

00:48:57.730 --> 00:48:59.934
then it's not, perhaps,
a surprise there would

00:48:59.934 --> 00:49:01.100
be phenotypic heterogeneity.

00:49:05.050 --> 00:49:07.740
What we're going to do
is go through these three

00:49:07.740 --> 00:49:11.840
different possible explanations
and discuss, maybe,

00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:13.990
canonical biological
examples of each.

00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:25.700
And the examples that
we're going to give-- well,

00:49:25.700 --> 00:49:28.760
the classic example is in the
context of seed germination.

00:49:37.870 --> 00:49:40.520
But more recently
there's this question

00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:45.470
of the persister cells, or
the persistence phenotype.

00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:56.280
Now in both of these
cases, it's really

00:49:56.280 --> 00:49:59.810
a way in which a
clonal population can

00:49:59.810 --> 00:50:03.700
send a small population
of either seeds or cells

00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:08.780
into a protected state that's
protected against some assault.

00:50:08.780 --> 00:50:11.640
So seed germination,
this is a case

00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:14.250
where the seed, if
it doesn't germinate,

00:50:14.250 --> 00:50:17.646
it's protected against draughts.

00:50:17.646 --> 00:50:18.146
Draught.

00:50:23.366 --> 00:50:24.865
And this one, maybe,
is antibiotics.

00:50:30.182 --> 00:50:31.640
What I want to do
is just make sure

00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:36.140
that we understand the
seed germination idea.

00:50:36.140 --> 00:50:39.010
And so this is, from the
standpoint of ecology,

00:50:39.010 --> 00:50:43.580
these ideas came out
in the '70s, at least.

00:50:43.580 --> 00:50:48.520
So what we can imagine is a
situation where you are some,

00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:49.550
maybe, desert annual.

00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:57.310
And so you send out these seeds.

00:50:57.310 --> 00:51:01.030
Now most of the time,
you get enough rain,

00:51:01.030 --> 00:51:02.240
the seeds are fine.

00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:05.430
They can germinate, sprout
the little seedlings,

00:51:05.430 --> 00:51:08.370
and they'll be able
to grow up just fine.

00:51:08.370 --> 00:51:10.830
But at some rate there
might be a severe drought

00:51:10.830 --> 00:51:14.600
that would kill all the cells
that actually germinated.

00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:19.130
So the question is, what
might be the optimal strategy?

00:51:19.130 --> 00:51:20.730
So for example,
let's just imagine

00:51:20.730 --> 00:51:27.840
that we live in a world
in which 75% of the time

00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:34.450
there's rain, 25% of the
time there's no rain.

00:51:37.230 --> 00:51:44.233
Now if you germinate--
so a particular seed,

00:51:44.233 --> 00:51:49.070
if it germinates,
it pops out-- then

00:51:49.070 --> 00:51:55.810
it will expect to send two
seeds to the following year,

00:51:55.810 --> 00:51:59.380
whereas as it germinates
and there's no rain,

00:51:59.380 --> 00:52:05.380
then it only has a 10%
probability of surviving,

00:52:05.380 --> 00:52:10.560
or that it could on
average send 1/10 of a seed

00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:13.910
to the next generation.

00:52:13.910 --> 00:52:15.760
Now of course, you
don't have to germinate.

00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:22.230
If you don't germinate,
then what happens

00:52:22.230 --> 00:52:28.770
is that you just send one
seed to the next year.

00:52:28.770 --> 00:52:31.190
If you'd like, you can
include some probability

00:52:31.190 --> 00:52:34.411
that the seed doesn't survive,
but for simplicity, we

00:52:34.411 --> 00:52:34.910
can do that.

00:52:38.090 --> 00:52:40.840
So the idea is that you don't
know whether it's going to rain

00:52:40.840 --> 00:52:41.890
or not.

00:52:41.890 --> 00:52:44.540
But what you can do is you
can either germinate or not

00:52:44.540 --> 00:52:46.760
germinate.

00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:49.206
And then this tells us
how many seeds make it

00:52:49.206 --> 00:52:50.510
to the following year.

00:52:50.510 --> 00:52:54.530
Do you understand the framework?

00:52:54.530 --> 00:53:00.580
So the question is, which
one of these strategies

00:53:00.580 --> 00:53:03.970
has a higher long
term growth rate

00:53:03.970 --> 00:53:07.257
in terms of the number
of seeds that you

00:53:07.257 --> 00:53:08.215
have in the population?

00:53:21.220 --> 00:53:23.950
I'm going to give
you 30 seconds just

00:53:23.950 --> 00:53:25.450
to kind of think
about this, play

00:53:25.450 --> 00:53:27.130
with the numbers a little bit.

00:53:27.130 --> 00:53:29.570
And the question
is, should you just

00:53:29.570 --> 00:53:32.054
have a strategy where you
germinate or don't germinate?

00:53:32.054 --> 00:53:33.470
And then what we're
going to find,

00:53:33.470 --> 00:53:35.950
maybe, is that the
optimal strategy is

00:53:35.950 --> 00:53:38.464
to do this probabilistically.

00:53:38.464 --> 00:53:40.380
But it's useful to just
play with such numbers

00:53:40.380 --> 00:53:41.088
for a little bit.

00:54:11.840 --> 00:54:13.590
The physics office,
unfortunately,

00:54:13.590 --> 00:54:16.310
is trying to steal our cards
from us, so we don't have them.

00:54:16.310 --> 00:54:18.010
But what we're
going to instead do

00:54:18.010 --> 00:54:20.939
is, if you think you
want to germinate

00:54:20.939 --> 00:54:21.980
you raise your left hand.

00:54:21.980 --> 00:54:24.229
If you don't want to germinate,
raise your right hand.

00:54:24.229 --> 00:54:24.770
OK.

00:54:24.770 --> 00:54:29.460
Ready, 3, 2, 1.

00:54:29.460 --> 00:54:33.710
So we have a fair
distribution of-- it really

00:54:33.710 --> 00:54:35.049
is kind of 50-50.

00:54:35.049 --> 00:54:35.840
That's interesting.

00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:41.106
All right, let's go ahead and--
yeah, let's spend a minute.

00:54:41.106 --> 00:54:43.730
Turn to your neighbor and try to
convince them that it's either

00:54:43.730 --> 00:54:44.854
better to germinate or not.

00:54:44.854 --> 00:55:23.316
[SIDE CONVERSATIONS]

00:55:23.316 --> 00:55:28.601
You can start with 100 of one,
100 of another, and then just--

00:55:28.601 --> 00:55:30.559
AUDIENCE: Start with 100
and then you just go--

00:55:30.559 --> 00:55:40.780
[SIDE CONVERSATIONS]

00:55:40.780 --> 00:55:43.030
PROFESSOR: Let's
say 10 to the 4.

00:55:43.030 --> 00:55:44.885
So we're trying to
not think about this--

00:55:44.885 --> 00:56:06.067
[SIDE CONVERSATIONS]

00:56:06.067 --> 00:56:07.900
So there's another
question about short term

00:56:07.900 --> 00:56:08.810
versus long term.

00:56:08.810 --> 00:56:12.310
And we're actually trying
to not worry about that.

00:56:12.310 --> 00:56:14.917
So you can think about large
populations, so it's really--

00:56:14.917 --> 00:56:16.292
AUDIENCE: This is
after one year.

00:56:16.292 --> 00:56:18.220
You will maximize
your expected value.

00:56:18.220 --> 00:56:19.340
PROFESSOR: That's why
I said the long term

00:56:19.340 --> 00:56:20.381
growth of the population.

00:56:20.381 --> 00:56:25.795
So if we just compare--
so why don't we reconvene.

00:56:25.795 --> 00:56:27.920
Various people have been
talking about the question

00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:30.564
of how many seeds
you're starting with,

00:56:30.564 --> 00:56:32.230
what the population
size is, because you

00:56:32.230 --> 00:56:33.560
have to worry about extinction.

00:56:33.560 --> 00:56:35.518
And that's another kind
of interesting question

00:56:35.518 --> 00:56:37.752
of short term versus long
term payouts of fitness.

00:56:37.752 --> 00:56:39.460
That's actually not
the effect that we're

00:56:39.460 --> 00:56:40.930
trying to get at right now.

00:56:40.930 --> 00:56:43.190
So we can even think about
this in the limit of just

00:56:43.190 --> 00:56:44.420
large population sizes.

00:56:44.420 --> 00:56:47.650
And we want to compare
the two strategies.

00:56:47.650 --> 00:56:49.599
And for any strategy
you choose, including

00:56:49.599 --> 00:56:51.140
the probabilistic
strategies, there's

00:56:51.140 --> 00:56:54.120
going to be a long term
growth rate of the population.

00:56:54.120 --> 00:56:56.882
So it will grow or shrink
exponentially over time.

00:56:56.882 --> 00:56:58.340
And what you want
to do is you want

00:56:58.340 --> 00:57:00.506
to find the strategy, in
the context of bet hedging,

00:57:00.506 --> 00:57:03.831
you want to find the strategy
that maximizes this long term

00:57:03.831 --> 00:57:05.080
growth rate of the population.

00:57:05.080 --> 00:57:09.020
And this is essentially what
Edo talks about in his paper,

00:57:09.020 --> 00:57:12.190
but in a more mathematical,
general-- because he's talking

00:57:12.190 --> 00:57:16.510
about n different
phenotypes and environments

00:57:16.510 --> 00:57:17.790
and arbitrary switching rates.

00:57:17.790 --> 00:57:21.090
And it's beautiful and general
and he makes nice connections

00:57:21.090 --> 00:57:22.650
to information theory.

00:57:22.650 --> 00:57:25.330
But it's possible to read
that paper and then not

00:57:25.330 --> 00:57:28.090
actually understand
what bet hedging,

00:57:28.090 --> 00:57:29.840
or what any of these
things are, quite.

00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:32.050
So it's good to take
the simple thing,

00:57:32.050 --> 00:57:34.780
and then it's also good to
know that somebody like Edo

00:57:34.780 --> 00:57:36.196
has thought about
this very deeply

00:57:36.196 --> 00:57:38.280
and figured out all
these beautiful things.

00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:42.280
And I know that paper was hard,
so don't-- but it's really like

00:57:42.280 --> 00:57:45.580
a two-page paper if
you look at the text.

00:57:45.580 --> 00:57:47.410
So it shouldn't take
too much time just

00:57:47.410 --> 00:57:49.201
to get a sense of what
he's thinking about.

00:57:49.201 --> 00:57:52.570
But then it's good, also, to be
concrete in a simple situation.

00:57:52.570 --> 00:57:55.052
So what we want to know is
that, over the long term--

00:57:55.052 --> 00:57:56.760
then what you can do
is you can just say,

00:57:56.760 --> 00:58:02.290
well, the ratios of rain,
no rain over the long term

00:58:02.290 --> 00:58:06.100
will be 3 to 1, because
it's over a long term.

00:58:06.100 --> 00:58:07.960
It doesn't matter what
order they come in

00:58:07.960 --> 00:58:10.316
because over the long run
it's all going to average out.

00:58:10.316 --> 00:58:12.190
We're assuming we're a
large population size,

00:58:12.190 --> 00:58:14.480
so we don't have to worry
about stochastic extinction.

00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:15.980
The question is,
since we don't have

00:58:15.980 --> 00:58:18.040
to worry about
stochastic extinction,

00:58:18.040 --> 00:58:22.450
then can we just
say that we just

00:58:22.450 --> 00:58:25.660
calculate, for example,
the mean weighted

00:58:25.660 --> 00:58:28.120
by these fractions
of these numbers?

00:58:28.120 --> 00:58:30.710
And actually, the
subtle possible thing

00:58:30.710 --> 00:58:34.350
is that it's the geometric
mean that is relevant,

00:58:34.350 --> 00:58:35.480
not the normal mean.

00:58:38.070 --> 00:58:41.340
And that's somehow tricky
when given these numbers.

00:58:41.340 --> 00:58:46.760
But it's sort of obvious if
you just switch this to a 0.

00:58:46.760 --> 00:58:49.364
Because if this is a
0, then is germinate

00:58:49.364 --> 00:58:50.530
going to be a good strategy?

00:58:53.050 --> 00:58:54.100
No, right?

00:58:54.100 --> 00:58:58.730
Because what that would mean
is that if everybody always

00:58:58.730 --> 00:59:01.770
germinates, it may be that
this number could be 1,000,

00:59:01.770 --> 00:59:05.560
and it's wonderful except
that if, at some low rate,

00:59:05.560 --> 00:59:09.260
there's no rain and this is a
0, then the population's dead.

00:59:09.260 --> 00:59:11.353
And you'll always
encounter that eventually.

00:59:11.353 --> 00:59:12.727
So that just
highlights that it's

00:59:12.727 --> 00:59:15.820
the geometric mean you
want to be focusing on.

00:59:15.820 --> 00:59:18.910
And in particular, we know that
on average, over the long term,

00:59:18.910 --> 00:59:20.160
there are going to be three
of these years for each

00:59:20.160 --> 00:59:20.820
of these years.

00:59:20.820 --> 00:59:22.710
So we can just
multiply the numbers.

00:59:22.710 --> 00:59:26.890
So it's really going to be
there's going to be three times

00:59:26.890 --> 00:59:33.770
where you double for each one
time that you divide by 10.

00:59:33.770 --> 00:59:36.480
What you see is that
over the long run,

00:59:36.480 --> 00:59:44.960
this population shrinks, whereas
in this case it's 1 times

00:59:44.960 --> 00:59:47.030
1 times 1 times 1.

00:59:49.800 --> 00:59:52.350
So the long term
growth rate/shrinking

00:59:52.350 --> 00:59:54.880
rate of these populations
is that in the long run

00:59:54.880 --> 00:59:56.675
this population does
not change in size,

00:59:56.675 --> 00:59:59.540
whereas over the long run,
this population shrinks.

00:59:59.540 --> 01:00:01.790
AUDIENCE: So in the geometric
mean the expected change

01:00:01.790 --> 01:00:04.922
in the log population, which
is also the expected percentage

01:00:04.922 --> 01:00:05.963
change in the population.

01:00:05.963 --> 01:00:06.546
Is that right?

01:00:09.755 --> 01:00:10.380
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:00:10.380 --> 01:00:11.730
So I think that if
you take the logs,

01:00:11.730 --> 01:00:12.730
it ends up being equivalent.

01:00:12.730 --> 01:00:14.605
But you have to make
sure you just do it all.

01:00:18.850 --> 01:00:21.650
And I guess what I want to
highlight in this case is that,

01:00:21.650 --> 01:00:25.310
A, you have to be careful
of taking averages, but B,

01:00:25.310 --> 01:00:27.090
to get the intuition
behind the situations

01:00:27.090 --> 01:00:29.480
where bet hedging, I
think, is really valuable,

01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:34.550
it's situations where
this thing gets very small

01:00:34.550 --> 01:00:36.610
and this might
become rather large.

01:00:36.610 --> 01:00:39.810
So you can imagine
that this could be 200

01:00:39.810 --> 01:00:42.310
and this could be
10 to the minus 9.

01:00:46.430 --> 01:00:48.790
Or if you'd like, you
could say that's 0.

01:00:48.790 --> 01:00:52.160
And it's clear that
if this is 0, then

01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:53.590
you can't germinate
all the time,

01:00:53.590 --> 01:00:55.256
because then the
population's definitely

01:00:55.256 --> 01:00:56.870
going to go extinct
over the long run.

01:00:56.870 --> 01:00:58.290
But this is also
a situation where

01:00:58.290 --> 01:01:01.290
there's real tension between
long term and short term

01:01:01.290 --> 01:01:05.840
situations if this
probability is very small.

01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:08.470
But it's in these
situations that it

01:01:08.470 --> 01:01:12.280
pays, in terms of the long run
growth rate of the population,

01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:16.366
to do this some
fraction of the time.

01:01:16.366 --> 01:01:17.490
And it could be very small.

01:01:17.490 --> 01:01:21.960
It could be that only one
in 10 to the 4 of the cells

01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:25.920
enter this persister state that
is resistant to antibiotics.

01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:27.991
But it can maximize
the long term growth

01:01:27.991 --> 01:01:28.949
rate of the population.

01:01:33.530 --> 01:01:35.952
There are various
models that you

01:01:35.952 --> 01:01:38.410
can write down for either seed
germination or this or that.

01:01:38.410 --> 01:01:43.110
But the relevant thing is, for
example, in the persister case,

01:01:43.110 --> 01:01:46.760
it might be that the rate
of persister formation

01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:49.070
might only be one cell in
10 to the 5 or 10 to the 6.

01:01:49.070 --> 01:01:51.430
So a very small
sub-population of the cells

01:01:51.430 --> 01:01:53.760
are in this so-called
persister state.

01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:56.510
But those cells, they have
a couple of properties.

01:01:56.510 --> 01:01:59.280
One is that they
are dividing slowly.

01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:02.379
That means there really is a
cost to entering that persister

01:02:02.379 --> 01:02:04.170
state, but if it's only
one of 10 to the 5,

01:02:04.170 --> 01:02:07.370
that means that it's really
a rather small cost in terms

01:02:07.370 --> 01:02:10.490
of decreasing the growth
of the population.

01:02:10.490 --> 01:02:13.195
And those cells also could
be resistant to antibiotics.

01:02:13.195 --> 01:02:14.820
So you can select
for them in the sense

01:02:14.820 --> 01:02:16.278
that you add a
bunch of antibiotics

01:02:16.278 --> 01:02:21.360
and maybe only the persister
cells are left after 12 hours.

01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:25.580
But even though I say
you selected for them,

01:02:25.580 --> 01:02:29.350
it's not a true antibiotic
resistance kind of mutation,

01:02:29.350 --> 01:02:31.320
because if you take that
persister population,

01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:32.890
you let it grow
back up, what you

01:02:32.890 --> 01:02:35.949
find is that it is still
sensitive to the antibiotic.

01:02:35.949 --> 01:02:38.240
Now it's also possible that
at some low rate, maybe one

01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:41.150
in 10 to the 8, you evolve
resistance to an antibiotic.

01:02:41.150 --> 01:02:44.010
That's genetic resistance
that stays with you,

01:02:44.010 --> 01:02:46.950
whereas the persister
kind of resistance, this

01:02:46.950 --> 01:02:50.750
is something that is
a phenotypic switch.

01:02:50.750 --> 01:02:52.970
And when it grows
back up, it kind of

01:02:52.970 --> 01:02:55.490
reverts back to the
original phenotype,

01:02:55.490 --> 01:02:58.170
which is being sensitive
to the antibiotic.

01:02:58.170 --> 01:03:00.380
So that's the classic
way that you distinguish

01:03:00.380 --> 01:03:04.114
between genetic resistance
and this persister-based or

01:03:04.114 --> 01:03:05.030
phenotypic resistance.

01:03:05.030 --> 01:03:05.380
Yes.

01:03:05.380 --> 01:03:06.921
AUDIENCE: What would
be the mechanism

01:03:06.921 --> 01:03:08.140
of something like that?

01:03:08.140 --> 01:03:09.139
PROFESSOR: That's right.

01:03:09.139 --> 01:03:11.141
So people argue a fair
amount about this.

01:03:11.141 --> 01:03:12.640
And there's a thought
that there are

01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:19.330
these toxin, anti-toxin modules
in bacteria that are normally

01:03:19.330 --> 01:03:21.070
suppressed but can be
triggered, and then

01:03:21.070 --> 01:03:22.880
can lead to these
states entering,

01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:28.900
although this ends up kind of
a muddy debate/subject somehow.

01:03:28.900 --> 01:03:32.480
But the idea is that there's
something in the cell that

01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:36.290
is normally repressed,
but then at some rate

01:03:36.290 --> 01:03:39.304
activates and causes the
cell to-- and of course,

01:03:39.304 --> 01:03:41.970
you can always argue, OK, did it
evolve for this purpose or not?

01:03:41.970 --> 01:03:44.320
Because also, if
you're dividing slowly,

01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:47.170
then you're going to be
resistant to many things.

01:03:47.170 --> 01:03:49.580
But then there's also arguments
that there are somehow

01:03:49.580 --> 01:03:51.520
more specific
persister-type states

01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:53.810
against particular assaults
or particular antibiotics.

01:03:53.810 --> 01:03:56.485
So I think that there
are many subtleties

01:03:56.485 --> 01:03:57.360
to this whole debate.

01:04:07.850 --> 01:04:11.010
Any other questions about
this idea of bet hedging?

01:04:15.150 --> 01:04:18.290
So I think that bet
hedging is indeed

01:04:18.290 --> 01:04:23.290
one possible way
in which evolution

01:04:23.290 --> 01:04:26.520
could select for phenotypic
heterogeneity in a population.

01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:29.620
So this is a population of seeds
that are all, in principle,

01:04:29.620 --> 01:04:30.480
identical.

01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:32.500
You put them out and
you plant them all

01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:34.320
and they see the
same environment.

01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:36.230
They don't all germinate.

01:04:36.230 --> 01:04:38.560
But it's not that all those
seeds that didn't germinate

01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:41.760
are dead, because actually,
the following year, they still

01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:44.206
go back and they can follow
some stochastic strategy.

01:04:44.206 --> 01:04:46.080
So I just want to stress
that right now we're

01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:49.260
considering the two extremes,
but for bet hedging,

01:04:49.260 --> 01:04:54.117
you say probability germinate,
1 minus p, don't germinate.

01:04:54.117 --> 01:04:56.700
And those are, in general, going
to be some probability p that

01:04:56.700 --> 01:04:58.882
can be non-0 that
maximizes long term growth

01:04:58.882 --> 01:04:59.840
rate of the population.

01:05:04.100 --> 01:05:08.130
But I do want to talk about two
other possible explanations,

01:05:08.130 --> 01:05:12.442
which is this idea of mixed
strategies and altruism.

01:05:12.442 --> 01:05:13.900
Now mixed strategies,
in some ways,

01:05:13.900 --> 01:05:16.040
is an obvious one,
because we just

01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:21.170
got done talking about mixed
strategies in game theory,

01:05:21.170 --> 01:05:25.470
where there is this notion
that in a given game,

01:05:25.470 --> 01:05:29.990
sometimes this Nash equilibrium
was a pure strategy,

01:05:29.990 --> 01:05:31.510
or the evolutionary
stable state.

01:05:31.510 --> 01:05:34.880
But sometimes at the
equilibrium there

01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:36.671
was coexistence of
these two strategies,

01:05:36.671 --> 01:05:38.170
and that could be
either implemented

01:05:38.170 --> 01:05:43.369
by two different genotypes, or
by one genotype implementing

01:05:43.369 --> 01:05:44.035
both phenotypes.

01:05:47.250 --> 01:05:50.540
So this was the classic
game that people talk about

01:05:50.540 --> 01:05:54.580
in this area is
this hawk dove game.

01:05:54.580 --> 01:05:58.700
We talked about this just
a little bit in class.

01:05:58.700 --> 01:06:00.480
So this is a model
of animal conflict.

01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:14.700
And the idea is the
animals can either

01:06:14.700 --> 01:06:19.350
be-- so the idea is that
there are two animals

01:06:19.350 --> 01:06:21.291
and they come across
some resource.

01:06:21.291 --> 01:06:23.040
And the resource could
be food or it could

01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:24.640
be a mate or something else.

01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:26.580
And the question is,
should those animals

01:06:26.580 --> 01:06:29.000
fight for the resource
or should they back down?

01:06:32.090 --> 01:06:33.920
Now the assumption
in all this is

01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:36.840
that the hawk is the strategy
that fights and the dove

01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:39.690
is the strategy that backs down.

01:06:39.690 --> 01:06:43.050
Now the question
is, how do we assign

01:06:43.050 --> 01:06:45.830
some sort of costs and benefits
to these various strategies?

01:06:45.830 --> 01:06:47.550
Again, where this is
the situation where

01:06:47.550 --> 01:06:49.050
we take the two-player
game and then

01:06:49.050 --> 01:06:51.470
we'll kind of generalize
it to the population.

01:06:51.470 --> 01:06:54.250
Well, if two doves
encounter each other,

01:06:54.250 --> 01:06:57.250
then they don't need
to fight at all,

01:06:57.250 --> 01:06:59.340
and they just split the benefit.

01:06:59.340 --> 01:07:01.382
So there's some benefit
to the resource,

01:07:01.382 --> 01:07:02.590
and they each get half of it.

01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:08.502
Now of course, if a
hawk meets a dove,

01:07:08.502 --> 01:07:13.680
the hawk actually does better,
because then the hawk gets

01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:19.220
the entire benefit, doesn't
have to pay the cost.

01:07:19.220 --> 01:07:21.670
So already we can see from
what I've said so far,

01:07:21.670 --> 01:07:25.150
is dove a Nash equilibrium?

01:07:25.150 --> 01:07:28.590
No, because you can already
see that if your opponent is

01:07:28.590 --> 01:07:30.340
a dove, it's better for you.

01:07:30.340 --> 01:07:32.298
If you start in the
situation where everybody's

01:07:32.298 --> 01:07:34.380
a dove, so everybody's
getting b over 2,

01:07:34.380 --> 01:07:36.480
then one individual
has the incentive

01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:40.570
to change strategies and
get the full benefit.

01:07:40.570 --> 01:07:44.370
That hawk never has to fight
anybody because they will all

01:07:44.370 --> 01:07:46.000
back down.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.740
Now of course this
dove that fought

01:07:48.740 --> 01:07:53.160
that hawk doesn't get
any of the resource,

01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:56.190
but also doesn't have to fight.

01:07:56.190 --> 01:07:59.020
However, question is, what
happens if two hawks meet?

01:07:59.020 --> 01:08:02.370
And that's a situation
where they really go at it.

01:08:02.370 --> 01:08:06.220
And what you might say is,
then, there's a 50-50 shot,

01:08:06.220 --> 01:08:10.720
that each individual has a 50%
chance of getting the benefit,

01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:13.222
but then also has
to pay this cost.

01:08:13.222 --> 01:08:14.680
And then you can
decide whether you

01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:17.840
want to have-- so I think
it's normally parameterized

01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:20.841
to b minus c over 2.

01:08:20.841 --> 01:08:23.090
The idea here is that you
have a 50% chance of getting

01:08:23.090 --> 01:08:26.870
the benefit, but you have a 50%
chance of getting beaten up.

01:08:26.870 --> 01:08:28.350
OK.

01:08:28.350 --> 01:08:29.359
Very simple model.

01:08:29.359 --> 01:08:32.090
Now the way that we
normally parameterize

01:08:32.090 --> 01:08:39.837
this is that-- let's say
that we want the hawk-- wait,

01:08:39.837 --> 01:08:41.600
hold on a second.

01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:44.250
Under which circumstances
will the hawk strategy

01:08:44.250 --> 01:08:46.324
be a Nash equilibrium?

01:08:52.228 --> 01:08:53.720
AUDIENCE: If b is larger than c.

01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:53.990
PROFESSOR: That's right.

01:08:53.990 --> 01:08:55.899
If b is larger than
c, then the hawk

01:08:55.899 --> 01:08:58.229
would be a Nash equilibrium,
which is actually what

01:08:58.229 --> 01:08:59.460
we don't want in this game.

01:08:59.460 --> 01:09:02.540
So what we typically
assume is that the benefit

01:09:02.540 --> 01:09:04.720
is less than the cost.

01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:08.240
So in that sense, it's somehow
not worth fighting for.

01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:13.319
And that means that neither
strategy is a Nash equilibrium.

01:09:13.319 --> 01:09:20.747
So neither the hawk nor the
dove is a Nash equilibrium.

01:09:20.747 --> 01:09:24.880
And indeed you can calculate
what the Nash equilibrium is,

01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:30.350
and the Nash equilibrium is
to follow a mixed strategy

01:09:30.350 --> 01:09:34.990
with some probability p star
that is, I think, b over c.

01:09:38.330 --> 01:09:40.847
So if there's a
bigger benefit, p star

01:09:40.847 --> 01:09:42.930
is the probability of
following the hawk strategy.

01:09:53.859 --> 01:09:57.920
But as the costs grow, then this
Nash equilibrium probability

01:09:57.920 --> 01:09:59.750
decreases.

01:09:59.750 --> 01:10:04.390
So this is a case where
it's a mixed strategy that

01:10:04.390 --> 01:10:05.680
is this Nash equilibrium.

01:10:09.060 --> 01:10:11.290
And so this is a
situation that displays

01:10:11.290 --> 01:10:14.644
what we call negative
frequency dependent selection.

01:10:14.644 --> 01:10:16.560
You can see that the
rare strategies do better

01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:18.164
than common strategies.

01:10:18.164 --> 01:10:19.580
The key way to
think about this is

01:10:19.580 --> 01:10:21.630
that if you have a
population of doves,

01:10:21.630 --> 01:10:24.050
then a rare hawk does better.

01:10:24.050 --> 01:10:25.930
However, if you have
a population of hawks,

01:10:25.930 --> 01:10:29.150
then it's a rare dove
that does better.

01:10:29.150 --> 01:10:31.940
And it's that kind of negative
frequency of dependence

01:10:31.940 --> 01:10:35.540
that pushes the population
towards some equilibrium

01:10:35.540 --> 01:10:38.610
between the
phenotypes, or it could

01:10:38.610 --> 01:10:42.200
be equilibrium between genotypes
as well, because you could have

01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:47.100
pure strategists of a hawk and
a dove, so different genotypes

01:10:47.100 --> 01:10:48.760
that just are different.

01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:51.720
And the differences in
fitness will naturally

01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:55.260
lead to evolution to
an equilibrium hawk

01:10:55.260 --> 01:10:56.840
kind of frequency
in the population

01:10:56.840 --> 01:10:58.580
that is equal to this.

01:10:58.580 --> 01:11:01.860
So this tells us either about
the equilibrium frequency

01:11:01.860 --> 01:11:04.210
of the genotype of
hawk in the population.

01:11:04.210 --> 01:11:06.350
Or it could be that it's
a single genotype that

01:11:06.350 --> 01:11:10.105
implements these two strategies
with some frequency that

01:11:10.105 --> 01:11:10.810
is b over c.

01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:23.232
So I'd say that this is a simple
idea from the context of game

01:11:23.232 --> 01:11:25.190
theory, and the question
is, what circumstances

01:11:25.190 --> 01:11:28.315
might this actually arise
in kind of real populations.

01:11:32.215 --> 01:11:33.590
Oh, before I say
anything else, I

01:11:33.590 --> 01:11:34.964
do want to stress
that all of you

01:11:34.964 --> 01:11:37.670
have played mixed strategies
before, because in the Rock

01:11:37.670 --> 01:11:40.086
Paper Scissors game, which
we're going to be talking about

01:11:40.086 --> 01:11:45.580
more in the coming week or
so-- you guys all know this,

01:11:45.580 --> 01:11:48.820
that rock beats-- not paper--
but rock beats scissors,

01:11:48.820 --> 01:11:50.930
scissors beats paper,
paper beats rock--

01:11:50.930 --> 01:11:55.360
so the Nash equilibrium of that
game is to do 1/3 1/3, 1/3,

01:11:55.360 --> 01:11:57.360
because if everybody's
following that strategy,

01:11:57.360 --> 01:11:59.330
nobody has the incentive
to change strategies.

01:11:59.330 --> 01:12:01.300
Definition of the
Nash equilibrium.

01:12:01.300 --> 01:12:05.080
Is that the optimal strategy
against any opponent?

01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:06.330
No.

01:12:06.330 --> 01:12:08.100
And this is very
important to point out,

01:12:08.100 --> 01:12:10.870
because when you think
about these Nash equilibrium

01:12:10.870 --> 01:12:12.750
and everything in
abstract terms,

01:12:12.750 --> 01:12:14.640
it's easy to get
confused about--

01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:17.016
when we say that it's--
sometimes we say optimal,

01:12:17.016 --> 01:12:18.390
or it's the solution
to the game,

01:12:18.390 --> 01:12:20.830
that doesn't mean that it's
the best response to any given

01:12:20.830 --> 01:12:21.690
strategy.

01:12:21.690 --> 01:12:23.064
And you know that,
because if you

01:12:23.064 --> 01:12:26.012
know that your little brother
is going to play rock, then

01:12:26.012 --> 01:12:27.720
you know-- well,
depending on whether you

01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:30.220
want to make him happy or not,
you decide what to do, right?

01:12:30.220 --> 01:12:32.970
So it's clear that this
1/3, 1/3, 1/3 thing

01:12:32.970 --> 01:12:35.197
is, it can be the solution
to the game of the Nash

01:12:35.197 --> 01:12:37.530
equilibrium without being the
best response to any given

01:12:37.530 --> 01:12:38.029
strategy.

01:12:41.384 --> 01:12:43.300
So one of things that
we're doing in my group,

01:12:43.300 --> 01:12:47.370
actually, is we're arguing
that in the case of yeasts that

01:12:47.370 --> 01:12:50.720
are exposed to mixed
sugar environments--

01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:53.850
so yeast in environments that
contain a little bit of glucose

01:12:53.850 --> 01:12:56.415
and a little bit of galactose--
what we and actually

01:12:56.415 --> 01:13:00.420
other people have found is that
there's a bimodal response.

01:13:00.420 --> 01:13:08.200
So if you look at the number of
cells as a function of the GAL

01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:10.472
operon expression, so
GAL is the expression

01:13:10.472 --> 01:13:12.930
of the genes required to break
down galactose, what you see

01:13:12.930 --> 01:13:17.240
is that some of the cells
activate the GAL genes highly,

01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:19.620
some don't activate it at all.

01:13:19.620 --> 01:13:21.420
So the question
is, what might be

01:13:21.420 --> 01:13:23.810
an explanation for this
phenotypic heterogeneity

01:13:23.810 --> 01:13:26.190
observed in a clonal population?

01:13:26.190 --> 01:13:27.960
And one way to
think about this is

01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:29.610
that it could be
the implementation

01:13:29.610 --> 01:13:31.420
of some sort of foraging game.

01:13:31.420 --> 01:13:34.530
So you can imagine a
population of animals that want

01:13:34.530 --> 01:13:36.320
to go and eat some berries.

01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:38.050
So there are two
different food sources--

01:13:38.050 --> 01:13:41.267
say there are blueberries
and there are red berries.

01:13:41.267 --> 01:13:43.350
You can imagine this is
the kind of situation that

01:13:43.350 --> 01:13:45.183
would lead to negative
frequency dependence,

01:13:45.183 --> 01:13:47.464
because if everybody
else goes and eats--

01:13:47.464 --> 01:13:49.880
I guess this was the blueberry--
so if everybody else goes

01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:51.360
and eats the blueberries,
then it's better for you

01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:52.750
to eat the red berry
because you don't have

01:13:52.750 --> 01:13:54.830
to share with anyone, whereas
if everyone else goes and eats

01:13:54.830 --> 01:13:56.650
the red berries, then
it's better for you

01:13:56.650 --> 01:13:58.460
to eat the blueberries.

01:13:58.460 --> 01:14:01.050
So that's the kind of
situation that would naturally

01:14:01.050 --> 01:14:03.860
lead to the so-called negative
frequency dependent selection,

01:14:03.860 --> 01:14:06.644
in which coexistence
of the phenotypes

01:14:06.644 --> 01:14:08.185
is somehow the
equilibrium condition,

01:14:08.185 --> 01:14:11.220
and that can be implemented
either by different genotypes

01:14:11.220 --> 01:14:13.830
or it can be implemented
by a single genotype that

01:14:13.830 --> 01:14:17.050
follows both phenotypes.

01:14:17.050 --> 01:14:20.772
Incidentally, is
this equilibrium--

01:14:20.772 --> 01:14:22.730
does it maximize the
fitness of the population?

01:14:34.260 --> 01:14:34.760
No.

01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:36.210
So what is it that
would maximize

01:14:36.210 --> 01:14:37.460
the fitness of the population?

01:14:39.720 --> 01:14:42.129
If everybody were a dove,
because-- and you can

01:14:42.129 --> 01:14:43.670
you go ahead and do
this calculation,

01:14:43.670 --> 01:14:45.420
find out what the
fitness of everybody is,

01:14:45.420 --> 01:14:49.300
but what you'll see is that p
star does not maximize fitness,

01:14:49.300 --> 01:14:52.800
ford not maximize payoff.

01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:56.799
So in these games, the
equilibrium is not necessarily

01:14:56.799 --> 01:14:57.590
fitness maximizing.

01:15:09.620 --> 01:15:12.280
So so far what
we've done is we've

01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:15.510
given two examples of
different evolutionary drivers

01:15:15.510 --> 01:15:17.550
for phenotypic heterogeneity
in a population.

01:15:17.550 --> 01:15:18.924
And I just want
to highlight what

01:15:18.924 --> 01:15:24.360
I think is maybe the last big
one, which would be altruism.

01:15:24.360 --> 01:15:27.480
And sometimes people call
it division of labor,

01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:29.890
or sacrifice or so.

01:15:29.890 --> 01:15:33.402
And a nice example of this
is colicin production.

01:15:40.790 --> 01:15:44.600
The idea is that
in many bacteria,

01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:47.765
they express these
colicin, which are toxins.

01:15:47.765 --> 01:15:49.940
And we're going to read
more about this later.

01:15:49.940 --> 01:15:51.555
So colicin is a toxin.

01:15:55.020 --> 01:15:57.430
And the perhaps
surprising thing is

01:15:57.430 --> 01:16:03.497
that in many gram-negative
bacteria, like E. coli, when

01:16:03.497 --> 01:16:05.580
they make this colicin,
the only way it's released

01:16:05.580 --> 01:16:06.440
is cell lysis.

01:16:16.770 --> 01:16:21.200
Now the question is, why
would I possibly do this?

01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:24.150
And the answer is,
perhaps, that if there's

01:16:24.150 --> 01:16:27.460
a plasmid that encodes the
genes to make this toxin,

01:16:27.460 --> 01:16:30.940
it also encodes an
immunity protein.

01:16:30.940 --> 01:16:35.090
What that means is that
if one cell lyses--

01:16:35.090 --> 01:16:37.280
so it bursts open and
releases the colicin--

01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:40.010
it will inhibit other
bacteria, but not

01:16:40.010 --> 01:16:43.880
the bacteria that are the
clone mates that are related,

01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:47.065
so not the bacteria that
also carry that plasmid.

01:16:47.065 --> 01:16:48.940
So it's important to
note there that now when

01:16:48.940 --> 01:16:51.760
we talk about kin
selection or relatedness,

01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:54.960
we're talking about the other
cells that carry that gene.

01:16:54.960 --> 01:17:00.990
So what's relevant is that the
plasma that encodes this toxin

01:17:00.990 --> 01:17:05.580
will inhibit other bacteria
that do not encode the toxin.

01:17:05.580 --> 01:17:08.560
Now you can see that this
kind of lysis behavior

01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:10.589
has to be stochastic,
so there has

01:17:10.589 --> 01:17:11.880
to be phenotypic heterogeneity.

01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:12.546
And why is that?

01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:18.690
AUDIENCE: Everyone always lyses.

01:17:18.690 --> 01:17:19.690
PROFESSOR: That's right.

01:17:19.690 --> 01:17:21.610
If this plasmid always
makes everybody lyse,

01:17:21.610 --> 01:17:24.240
then it's not going to
get very far, right?

01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:26.620
But you can kind of
imagine situations

01:17:26.620 --> 01:17:29.270
where, if you just
1% of the population

01:17:29.270 --> 01:17:31.700
lyses but then
inhibits the cells that

01:17:31.700 --> 01:17:33.832
don't care that plasmid,
then the plasmid

01:17:33.832 --> 01:17:35.040
can spread in the population.

01:17:38.810 --> 01:17:40.740
So this has to be stochastic.

01:17:51.030 --> 01:17:53.280
So I think that this is
another general explanation

01:17:53.280 --> 01:17:55.238
for why there might be
phenotypic heterogeneity

01:17:55.238 --> 01:17:56.570
in the population.

01:17:56.570 --> 01:17:59.560
All of these three explanations
are both conceptually different

01:17:59.560 --> 01:18:01.460
and they're
experimentally different.

01:18:01.460 --> 01:18:05.070
They make different
falsifiable predictions

01:18:05.070 --> 01:18:08.690
about what's driving that
phenotypic heterogeneity.

01:18:08.690 --> 01:18:10.740
In this field, I think
often when people

01:18:10.740 --> 01:18:12.660
see phenotypic heterogeneity,
they immediately

01:18:12.660 --> 01:18:16.080
assume that it's bet
hedging, but these other two

01:18:16.080 --> 01:18:18.660
explanations, I think,
are just as general

01:18:18.660 --> 01:18:20.416
and may be just as common.

01:18:20.416 --> 01:18:22.290
So we really have to go
and make measurements

01:18:22.290 --> 01:18:26.280
to try to elucidate what's
going on in each case.
