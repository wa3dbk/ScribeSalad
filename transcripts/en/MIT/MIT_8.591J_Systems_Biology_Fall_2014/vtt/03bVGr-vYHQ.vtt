00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.230
PROFESSOR: Our goal for
today is to basically analyze

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.530
this simple model to death.

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:30.520
So we're first going
to try to understand

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.190
the deterministic behavior
of this model gene

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.130
expression, where we just
get transcription of mRNA,

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.100
and then translation of protein.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.272
And after we think we
understand the mean behavior,

00:00:43.272 --> 00:00:44.730
the deterministic
dynamics, then we

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.490
will try to understand
just stochastic behavior

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:49.400
in this model.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.370
So we're going to
try to understand

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.450
what's the distribution
of mRNA in a cell

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:56.920
in this simple situation.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.770
What's the distribution
of protein?

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.400
What's going to be
the bursting behavior?

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.900
Everything you can
possibly think of

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.070
to ask about this
model, we will hopefully

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.230
have asked by the
end of today's class.

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:10.150
This simple model
of gene expression,

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.830
as was indicated in
the review, is perhaps

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.800
a reasonable description
of gene expression

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:21.180
in bacteria, when the gene
is in some active state.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.312
So there's no repressor,
for example, bound.

00:01:25.312 --> 00:01:26.770
Although maybe even
in the presence

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.660
of a repressor, if it's
binding and unbinding,

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.118
maybe you still end up getting
some sort of renormalization

00:01:31.118 --> 00:01:32.600
that looks like this.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.220
But this is first order,
a reasonable description

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.710
of gene expression in bacteria.

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.460
And it's the model
that was basically

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.070
used in the Sunney Xie
paper that we talked about

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.860
on Tuesday.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.560
And hopefully this
model will allow

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.880
us to think a little bit
more deeply about the data

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.640
that they obtained
in that paper.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.320
As always, we want to
start by understanding

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.612
the basic aspects of the model.

00:01:58.612 --> 00:02:00.070
So what we're going
to do, is we're

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.010
going to go through
a series of questions

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:03.660
of increasing difficulty.

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.580
And in some of
them, we are indeed,

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:12.242
the answers will end up being
something divided by something.

00:02:12.242 --> 00:02:14.200
In which case you take
advantage of your cards,

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.490
and illustrate that by putting
something on top, something

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.990
below.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.270
But just first in this model,
what is the unit of time?

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.072
So if I say t is equal to
1, or delta t is equal to 1,

00:02:32.072 --> 00:02:35.460
what am I referring to?

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:36.860
So we're not use the cards.

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.070
But in particular, the question
is, is delta t equal to 1,

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.560
is that a cell
cycle necessarily?

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.550
Yes or no, ready,
three, two, one.

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:54.850
Well I guess now maybe I've
complicated things by-- well,

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.910
this was really going to be
relevant for the later ones.

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:58.910
All right.

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.000
Now I've totally confused you.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.590
But can somebody offer
why it may or may not

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.920
be-- how do we think about the
unit of time in this model?

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.675
AUDIENCE: Usually
the lifetime of one

00:03:10.675 --> 00:03:11.800
of the species [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:14.322 --> 00:03:15.030
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.640
OK so indeed, what we often do
in these non-dimensionalized

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.530
models is we set
something equal to 1.

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.876
Have we set anything
equal to 1 here?

00:03:23.876 --> 00:03:24.430
No.

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:25.888
So in principle,
we've said there's

00:03:25.888 --> 00:03:28.440
some degradation rate of
the mRNA, some degradation

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.600
rate of the protein.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.780
And in general, those will be
given in some units involving

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.120
seconds or minutes or hours.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.350
So in general, so
at this stage, we

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.240
have not yet-- we
have not actually

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.980
gotten to this sort of
non-dimensionalized version

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:47.110
of any model.

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.490
So in this case this is
going to be something

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:53.500
like a seconds, or
minutes, or hours,

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.230
whatever units we use for
those degradation rates.

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.488
So we have not done anything
where it's the cell generation

00:04:01.488 --> 00:04:03.863
time, or the protein lifetime,
mRNA lifetime, or anything

00:04:03.863 --> 00:04:04.790
like that.

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.260
Here everybody happy with
this statement so far?

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.180
So we'll go ahead and vote here.

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.899
So we're going to do
some A, B, C, D's.

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:19.890
And you can always
combine anything you want.

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.630
So we'll go ahead
and say this is

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.980
the synthesis rate of the mRNA.

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.330
This is the degradation rate
for the mRNA, the synthesis

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.105
rate for the protein,
the degradation

00:04:31.105 --> 00:04:31.980
rate for the protein.

00:04:34.747 --> 00:04:36.830
And if you're just confused,
you can just do this.

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.288
But in general, for any of the
questions we're going to do,

00:04:39.288 --> 00:04:40.997
you can do some
combination of these guys

00:04:40.997 --> 00:04:42.954
by putting things in
numerator and denominator.

00:04:42.954 --> 00:04:43.576
Yes?

00:04:43.576 --> 00:04:45.534
AUDIENCE: Calculate the
population of the cells

00:04:45.534 --> 00:04:46.650
that were hidden?

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:47.930
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.810
Question is, if you just
look at the cell population,

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:53.520
and you find it's
growing exponentially,

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.100
the question is what is
going to be that rate

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.016
of exponential growth.

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:01.090
Have I done something
wrong already?

00:05:04.158 --> 00:05:05.074
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:05:08.317 --> 00:05:08.900
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.450
But I am going to say
that now for this we're

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:13.800
going to assume that
the protein is stable.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.115
So it's not actually degraded.

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.400
This is to remind you of what
we read about in chapter one,

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.986
maybe of Uri's book,
maybe chapter two.

00:05:29.986 --> 00:05:31.860
I'll give you 10 seconds
to think about this.

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:44.070
Do you need more time?

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:48.590
All right, Ready,
three, two, one.

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:50.010
OK.

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:53.230
We got a bunch of C's and a
bunch of D's and some E's.

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:53.730
All right.

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:56.250
So the E's are going to argue
with me, presumably rather than

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:56.750
a neighbor.

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:01.802
OK.

00:06:01.802 --> 00:06:03.510
I think that there
are enough people that

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:06.012
are disagreeing on this to
maybe go ahead, and turn.

00:06:06.012 --> 00:06:07.470
You should be able
to find somebody

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:08.580
that disagrees with you.

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.980
The distribution was a
bit patchy, unfortunately.

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:14.534
Did you guys-- you guys are
worried that you're not going

00:06:14.534 --> 00:06:15.700
to be able to find somebody.

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:16.199
OK.

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:17.650
Fine, fine.

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:18.650
Yeah?

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:22.580
AUDIENCE: So if the
protein is stable, ah,

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:24.512
so the mRNA may not be stable?

00:06:24.512 --> 00:06:26.095
PROFESSOR: The mRNA
may not be stable.

00:06:26.095 --> 00:06:26.926
AUDIENCE: Ah, OK.

00:06:26.926 --> 00:06:27.700
That makes sense.

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:29.980
PROFESSOR: And in general
which one typically

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:31.899
has a longer lifetime?

00:06:31.899 --> 00:06:32.690
AUDIENCE: Proteins.

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:34.931
PROFESSOR: Proteins typically
have a longer lifetime.

00:06:34.931 --> 00:06:35.430
Right.

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:40.810
So mRNA are actively
degraded, typically.

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:44.117
They're also just kind of
less stable intrinsically.

00:06:44.117 --> 00:06:45.700
But what we're going
to assume for now

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:48.890
is that we're working
with stable proteins.

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:54.340
In which case the growth
rate of the population

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:57.270
will just be this
effective degradation

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:59.450
rate of the protein.

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:01.420
So in this model,
even if we say there's

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:04.050
no active degradation
of the protein,

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:08.940
still there's going to be some
effective degradation that's

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:10.930
due to dilution.

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:13.308
So we can say
effective, if you like.

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:18.819
So the rate of exponential
growth of the population

00:07:18.819 --> 00:07:20.610
will be equal to this
effective degradation

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:22.151
rate for the protein,
if it's stable.

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:26.590
AUDIENCE: So you're talking
about the population

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:28.990
of the protein?

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:30.000
PROFESSOR: No.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.240
The growth rate of
the cell population.

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:37.620
So this is if we go
in there, and you

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:38.980
go into your spectrophotometer.

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:42.190
And you measure population--
numbers in function of time

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:43.280
is growing exponentially.

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:45.300
It'll grow exponentially
with this rate.

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.710
Because this is what's
causing the dilution.

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:52.423
In some ways if you
stop making the protein,

00:07:52.423 --> 00:07:54.506
and you double the number
of cells, and that means

00:07:54.506 --> 00:07:57.100
the concentration of
the protein in each cell

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:59.420
has to go down by
a factor of two.

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:00.420
So that's the statement.

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:05.347
Are there any questions about
why I'm making this argument?

00:08:05.347 --> 00:08:05.846
Yes?

00:08:05.846 --> 00:08:08.280
AUDIENCE: What was the relevance
of the protein being stable?

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:08.720
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:10.261
So the relevance of
the protein being

00:08:10.261 --> 00:08:14.700
stable, because this is in
general, this delta, this

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:17.540
is the effective rate.

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:20.970
This is going to be equal to the
growth rate of the population.

00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:25.740
So you might call
it gamma growth

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:30.010
plus the actual degradation.

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:32.599
I don't want to use
the same, but I'll just

00:08:32.599 --> 00:08:34.770
say plus the degradation rate.

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:40.627
And this is a true physical
degradation, true degradation

00:08:40.627 --> 00:08:42.750
rate of the protein.

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:47.380
So if it's stable, then we
say that this thing is zero.

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:48.820
So when we say
stable protein, it

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:50.970
means there's no
degradation of the protein.

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:53.700
So this physical
degradation rate is zero.

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:56.070
And then the effective
degradation rate of the protein

00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:59.148
is just equal to the growth
rate of the population.

00:08:59.148 --> 00:09:02.052
AUDIENCE: OK, so no degradation
means stable, basically?

00:09:02.052 --> 00:09:05.434
PROFESSOR: Yes, sorry, yeah.

00:09:05.434 --> 00:09:07.350
Any other questions about
what I mean by this?

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:13.980
So now what we want to do is
ask a few other quantities

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:15.240
about this model.

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:21.650
So for example, what will be
the number of mRNA per cell?

00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:34.455
And this is always
going to be the mean.

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:42.570
I'll give you 20 seconds.

00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:45.560
In this model what is the
mean number of mRNA per cell?

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:10.280
All right.

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:12.580
Ready?

00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:14.720
Three, two, one.

00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:24.580
And we have let's say
a majority of the group

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:28.420
is saying it's A over B, which
corresponds to the synthesis

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:31.540
rate of the mRNA divided
by the degradation.

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:33.370
Some people are this one?

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:35.750
Yes, so this is
indeed, synthesis rate

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:37.320
divided by the degradation rate.

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:45.330
Now this is saying
that what happens later

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:50.300
doesn't really matter,
for the mean mRNA number.

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:52.860
Because it's just that it's
going to be made at some rate.

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:55.290
Its lifetime is given
by 1 over delta m.

00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:58.509
Now this thing, of course,
is again as always,

00:10:58.509 --> 00:10:59.800
the effective degradation rate.

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:03.440
So it's the sum of the sort
of physical degradation rate,

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:06.570
plus this dilution
due to growth.

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:09.170
But in general, the
true degradation,

00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:11.920
the physical degradation is much
faster than the cell division

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:12.980
rate.

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:15.350
So this is very close
to actually just

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:18.140
the physical degradation rate.

00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:22.640
But in any case, it's
just delta m, regardless.

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:26.920
Are there any questions about
why this is the way it is?

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:27.820
Yes?

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:30.740
AUDIENCE: Does it matter
whether it's only physical?

00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:32.610
Because wouldn't it be
the same if it were--

00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:34.860
PROFESSOR: It doesn't matter
that it's only-- exactly.

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:36.193
That's what I was trying to say.

00:11:36.193 --> 00:11:37.680
So the way that
this is written, it

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:41.952
doesn't matter whether the--
this is the answer regardless

00:11:41.952 --> 00:11:43.410
of whether the
physical degradation

00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:45.990
rate is much larger than
the growth rate or not.

00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:46.490
Yeah.

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.330
All right.

00:11:52.330 --> 00:12:00.150
What is this protein
molecules per mRNA?

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:04.690
How many protein molecules
are made from each mRNA?

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:40.215
Protein produced-- Do
you need more time?

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:52.820
Remember.

00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:56.340
This is again, the
mean number of proteins

00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:58.910
produced from a single
mRNA or each mRNA.

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:05.570
Let's go ahead and vote,
so I can see where we are.

00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:06.330
Ready?

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:08.480
Three, two, one.

00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:14.990
OK.

00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:20.730
So we have, I'd say,
so at least a majority

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:24.961
are saying it's going
to be C over B Now.

00:13:24.961 --> 00:13:25.460
All right.

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:26.510
So this is interesting.

00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:28.660
So this is saying that
really what's happening

00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:34.190
is that there's a
competition once you

00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:37.660
make an mRNA that the proteins
are going to be getting

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:38.752
fired off at some rate.

00:13:38.752 --> 00:13:40.460
But eventually it's
going to be degraded.

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:42.305
It's a competition
between those two rates

00:13:42.305 --> 00:13:45.340
that determines basically
how many proteins,

00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:48.219
how many times do you fire
off a protein before you

00:13:48.219 --> 00:13:48.760
get degraded.

00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:54.230
Any questions about that logic?

00:13:57.767 --> 00:14:00.100
AUDIENCE: Can you please just
repeat that one more time?

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:00.810
PROFESSOR: Sure.

00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:04.054
Right, so what we're assuming
is that OK, an mRNA is produced.

00:14:04.054 --> 00:14:05.220
And that's already happened.

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:07.800
So it doesn't matter
what Sm is anymore.

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:08.780
So now we have an mRNA.

00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:14.580
Eventually this mRNA
will be degraded.

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:18.210
But before that happens,
we want to know, basically

00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:21.710
how many proteins do
we expect to be made.

00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:24.820
Now if Sp and delta m
are the same that means

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:27.800
you kind of expect one
protein to be made on average,

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:28.800
before it's degraded.

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:31.380
Or if Sp we're twice
delta m, then you

00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:34.580
would get two proteins made
before it was degraded.

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:36.680
Now this is a mean statement.

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:39.000
We're about to start
thinking-- in 10 minutes,

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.140
we'll think about
this distribution.

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:42.560
And so we have to be careful.

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:46.504
But in terms of mean
behavior, this thing is true.

00:14:46.504 --> 00:14:48.243
AUDIENCE: So is this
different than it

00:14:48.243 --> 00:14:53.467
has been for the number of
proteins per mRNA in the cell?

00:14:53.467 --> 00:14:55.300
PROFESSOR: Is this
different from the number

00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:57.150
of proteins in the cell?

00:14:57.150 --> 00:15:02.551
AUDIENCE: Number of proteins
per mRNA in the cell.

00:15:02.551 --> 00:15:05.006
Because then you will have to
do the protein concentration

00:15:05.006 --> 00:15:06.107
over mRNA concentration.

00:15:06.107 --> 00:15:06.690
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:07.190
Right.

00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:12.140
So this is not the same thing
as asking about the ratio

00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:13.430
of the number of proteins.

00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:16.239
And we can calculate
that as well.

00:15:16.239 --> 00:15:17.280
Yeah these are different.

00:15:19.775 --> 00:15:21.400
This is the number
of protein molecules

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:22.632
produced from each mRNA.

00:15:22.632 --> 00:15:24.340
So this is just talking
about production.

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:25.740
Because indeed, the
degradation rates

00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:26.823
are going to be different.

00:15:26.823 --> 00:15:31.330
So then we can see what
that ends up being.

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:34.490
Any other questions about
why this one is what it is?

00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:43.150
How about the number of mRNA
produced per cell cycle?

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:52.380
And for now we're going to
ignore factors of log two.

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:37.790
Do you need more time?

00:16:41.704 --> 00:16:42.620
So another 10 seconds.

00:16:54.596 --> 00:16:56.592
AUDIENCE: Produced
but not degraded?

00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:00.524
PROFESSOR: Produced, yes.

00:17:00.524 --> 00:17:02.024
We're just talking
about production.

00:17:05.089 --> 00:17:10.980
Because we've already calculated
a number of mRNA in the cell.

00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:14.670
But now we want to know
the mean number produced.

00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:17.490
For example, this is the
same as the mean number

00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:23.910
of protein bursts observed
in Sunney Xie's paper.

00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:27.089
But this is just the number of
mRNA produced per cell cycle.

00:17:27.089 --> 00:17:27.589
All right.

00:17:27.589 --> 00:17:28.180
Let's see where we are.

00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:28.679
Ready?

00:17:28.679 --> 00:17:31.811
Three, two, one.

00:17:31.811 --> 00:17:32.310
All right.

00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:34.720
So we've got lots
of A's over D's.

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:36.060
That's sounds nice.

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:38.090
So this is going to be
some synthesis rate.

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:40.600
But now the relevant
thing is this delta p.

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:43.250
Because that's the
cell division rate.

00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:46.050
So it's barring
issues of log two,

00:17:46.050 --> 00:17:47.630
it's approximately
the synthesis rate

00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:50.770
of the mRNA divided by delta p.

00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:54.760
Because this is the
growth rate of population.

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:59.595
Cell generation time
is log two off of that.

00:17:59.595 --> 00:18:01.470
Are there any questions
about that statement?

00:18:04.810 --> 00:18:06.870
All right, so this
is the mean number.

00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:09.745
Now from the paper, we know
how this thing is distributed.

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:19.270
We should probably-- we're going
to use a bunch of distributions

00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:21.840
over the next couple.

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:30.540
So we can-- we like
exponential distributions.

00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:33.810
We like geometric distributions.

00:18:36.465 --> 00:18:37.370
We like Poisson.

00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:41.500
We like Gaussian.

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:46.160
And we like gamma.

00:18:51.672 --> 00:18:53.505
These are various
probability distributions.

00:18:53.505 --> 00:18:55.887
The question is, how is
it that now, not the mean,

00:18:55.887 --> 00:18:57.470
but how is the number
of mRNA produced

00:18:57.470 --> 00:19:00.400
per cell cycle distributed.

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:00.960
Ready?

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:02.800
Three, two, one.

00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:08.620
All right.

00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:15.290
We've got some-- this side
of the rooms a little bit

00:19:15.290 --> 00:19:16.530
slower, maybe.

00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:18.710
But that's OK.

00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:22.370
So maybe some people are not
confident of this statement.

00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:22.870
OK.

00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:24.286
So this one ends
up being Poisson.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.630
So this is indeed how
the number of-- this

00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:36.100
is number mRNA per cycle.

00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:38.190
Now this is-- so
Poisson, in general,

00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:41.080
that's what you get if there's
some probability per unit time

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:42.030
that something's
going to happen,

00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:44.696
and you want to know how many of
them happen in some finite time

00:19:44.696 --> 00:19:45.240
period.

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:47.115
That's basically the
definition of a Poisson.

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:54.110
And this is, if you recall,
this is what we talked about

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:54.610
on Tuesday.

00:19:54.610 --> 00:20:00.200
The probability observe n,
it's given by this mean number.

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:01.820
So if lambda is
the mean, then we

00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:04.620
get lambda to the
n, over n factorial,

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:07.020
e to the minus lambda.

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:10.840
If you go ahead and
calculate the mean of this,

00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:12.170
you indeed get lambda.

00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:17.890
So lambda is equal to the
mean, which in this case

00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:21.530
was around, well in the
case of Sunney's paper,

00:20:21.530 --> 00:20:25.821
does anybody remember
what that roughly was?

00:20:25.821 --> 00:20:26.570
It was around one.

00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:37.770
Now what about this other one?

00:20:37.770 --> 00:20:40.600
So we also have
another mRNA problem,

00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:43.900
which is that we calculated the
mean number of mRNA per cell.

00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:46.790
If you look at a cell,
the mean number is this.

00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:48.970
But what's the
probability distribution

00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:51.400
of the number of mRNA per cell?

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:56.940
So we probably-- I'm trying
think it-- you probably

00:20:56.940 --> 00:20:58.980
don't yet know this answer.

00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:00.720
This ends up also being Poisson.

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:02.960
We're going to
calculate this in a bit.

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:05.260
But this is very
confusing somehow.

00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:07.816
That both this thing and
this thing, are Poisson.

00:21:07.816 --> 00:21:09.190
But they're not
the same Poisson,

00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:11.410
in the sense they have
different lambdas.

00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:14.617
Which one is going to be larger?

00:21:14.617 --> 00:21:15.492
This one or this one?

00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:19.030
The bottom one, right?

00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:22.260
And that's because delta m
is much larger than delta p,

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:23.910
typically.

00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:27.800
So indeed, if you ask, in
Sunney's paper, for example,

00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:31.460
there was just over one mRNA
produced per cell cycle.

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:36.420
But the mean number of mRNA
might have been 1/30th of that.

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:39.910
Because the degradation rate
was just 1 and 1/2 minutes.

00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:43.520
What that's saying is that
in a typical situation

00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:47.900
you would not see an mRNA
in a cell in that condition.

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:52.550
We're going to calculate
this in a moment.

00:21:52.550 --> 00:21:55.810
So don't worry if you don't
see why it's a Poisson.

00:21:55.810 --> 00:21:56.859
But don't get confused.

00:21:56.859 --> 00:21:58.400
There are two
different distributions

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:01.869
that arise from the mRNA in
the cell or in the cell cycle.

00:22:01.869 --> 00:22:03.160
And they're different Poissons.

00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:08.980
And I think that-- I mean I'm
sure that in some deep sense

00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:10.605
there's a reason that
they're the same.

00:22:10.605 --> 00:22:13.760
But it's somehow not
immediately obvious.

00:22:18.456 --> 00:22:20.830
So there was another one that
we might have wanted to do,

00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:27.070
which is the mean number
of proteins in each cell.

00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:45.740
Now this one is a bit harder.

00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:49.341
And this one is going to take
full advantage of the cards

00:22:49.341 --> 00:22:50.590
that you have in front of you.

00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:52.425
So be prepared.

00:22:52.425 --> 00:22:53.800
I'm going to give
you 30 seconds.

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:56.201
Because this one
you might-- well

00:22:56.201 --> 00:22:57.784
you might need a
little bit more time.

00:23:33.682 --> 00:23:34.640
AUDIENCE: This is hard.

00:23:38.719 --> 00:23:39.385
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:23:39.385 --> 00:23:42.272
Although I think that
it's useful to see that

00:23:42.272 --> 00:23:43.230
it can be a bit tricky.

00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:46.120
Because this really is the
simplest possible model.

00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:49.370
We're going to talk
about some models that

00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:50.721
get to be horribly complicated.

00:23:50.721 --> 00:23:52.220
And so it's useful
to just make sure

00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:54.401
you can nail down the
intuition on this model.

00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:11.150
All right.

00:24:11.150 --> 00:24:12.066
Do you need more time?

00:24:12.066 --> 00:24:15.179
It's OK if this is escaping
you at this moment.

00:24:15.179 --> 00:24:16.720
Why don't we go and
see where we are?

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:17.350
Ready?

00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:19.030
Three, two, one.

00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:23.520
All right.

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:26.332
So you know all the
naysayers on the cards,

00:24:26.332 --> 00:24:27.790
now that you've
done this, you feel

00:24:27.790 --> 00:24:29.540
like it's an amazing system.

00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:31.200
So it's AC over DB.

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:33.540
So the two, the product
of the synthesis rates

00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:36.060
divided by the product
of degradation rates.

00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:38.040
So what we have is
the synthesis rate

00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:41.000
for the mRNA divided by the
degradation rate for the mRNA.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.666
Synthesis rate for the proteins
divided by the degradation rate

00:24:43.666 --> 00:24:45.800
for the proteins.

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:48.210
Can somebody give us
a verbal explanation

00:24:48.210 --> 00:24:52.014
for why this might have
been, or why this is?

00:24:52.014 --> 00:24:54.002
Yes?

00:24:54.002 --> 00:24:55.990
AUDIENCE: It's
the same reasoning

00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:58.972
as the number of mRNA per cell.

00:24:58.972 --> 00:25:04.439
But instead of just a
basel-- like a synthesis rate

00:25:04.439 --> 00:25:06.427
doesn't depend on
the concentration.

00:25:06.427 --> 00:25:08.940
You're just multiplying
the synthesis rate

00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:11.001
by the number of mRNA.

00:25:11.001 --> 00:25:12.250
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's great.

00:25:12.250 --> 00:25:13.160
OK.

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:17.220
So what you're saying is that
this thing here was indeed,

00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:20.325
we calculate that was the mean
number of mRNA in the cell.

00:25:20.325 --> 00:25:21.700
If you just start
with something,

00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:23.120
and you have a production
and degradation rate.

00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:23.620
OK.

00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:26.510
Well that means that if you had
one mRNA, then indeed that's

00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:30.100
what the concentration would be,
is this Sp divided by delta p.

00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:33.440
But now we-- well we multiply
that by the number of mRNA,

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:34.600
and then we are set.

00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:43.000
All right.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:50.010
Now another question.

00:25:50.010 --> 00:25:53.130
We have a distribution,
or a mean protein--

00:25:53.130 --> 00:25:58.350
wait sorry, mean number.

00:25:58.350 --> 00:26:00.190
We have the mean number
of protein produced

00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:04.730
from each mRNA, is something.

00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:08.720
And the question is, is this the
most likely number of proteins

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:10.420
to observe.

00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:14.195
Is the distribution
here, now this is a mean,

00:26:14.195 --> 00:26:15.570
but now we want
to start thinking

00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:17.960
about the probabilistic
stochastic elements.

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:20.590
Is this the most likely, is
it like the number of proteins

00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:21.932
observed from an mRNA?

00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:29.240
The question is, is
this most likely.

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:31.380
By which I mean is the
probability distribution

00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:33.480
peaked here.

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:37.170
So we're going to do an A
as a yes, and B is a no.

00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:45.520
Does everybody understand the
question I'm trying to ask?

00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:47.612
So an mRNA is here.

00:26:47.612 --> 00:26:49.570
There's going to be some
proteins made from it.

00:26:49.570 --> 00:26:51.040
This is the mean.

00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:54.249
What I want to know is, is
that we should somehow expect?

00:26:54.249 --> 00:26:56.540
In a sense, is the distribution
peaked, the probability

00:26:56.540 --> 00:27:00.630
distribution peaked
around this value?

00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:04.410
And C is-- do I want
to do a depends?

00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:08.321
Well you can always argue after.

00:27:08.321 --> 00:27:11.750
Do you need more time?

00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:13.622
AUDIENCE: Is this,
you're saying,

00:27:13.622 --> 00:27:16.134
is this the most likely
number of proteins?

00:27:16.134 --> 00:27:16.800
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:21.778
What I'm wondering
is the mode there?

00:27:21.778 --> 00:27:22.444
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:27:22.444 --> 00:27:24.560
But only for this quantity?

00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:26.360
PROFESSOR: Only yeah.

00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:28.200
So now we're not
doing means anymore.

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:30.158
We want to know if the
probability distribution

00:27:30.158 --> 00:27:31.980
of the protein
produced from each mRNA

00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:33.950
is the mode around this.

00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:34.960
Ready?

00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:37.810
Three, two, one.

00:27:37.810 --> 00:27:38.310
All right.

00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:41.144
We got a lot of
no's, but some yeses.

00:27:41.144 --> 00:27:42.685
So this is actually
going to be a no.

00:27:42.685 --> 00:27:49.860
And this was because the
probability distribution.

00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:52.150
The question is, what is
the probability distribution

00:27:52.150 --> 00:27:55.551
for the number of proteins
produced from each mRNA.

00:27:55.551 --> 00:27:56.800
It's going to be one of these.

00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:57.640
Ready?

00:27:57.640 --> 00:27:59.400
Three, two, one.

00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:05.110
All right.

00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:06.770
So we've got some difference.

00:28:06.770 --> 00:28:08.634
But I'd say that
most of the group

00:28:08.634 --> 00:28:10.050
is saying it's
going to be A or B.

00:28:10.050 --> 00:28:13.790
And indeed these are almost
the same distributions.

00:28:13.790 --> 00:28:15.727
What's the difference
between them?

00:28:15.727 --> 00:28:16.810
AUDIENCE: One's discrete--

00:28:16.810 --> 00:28:16.980
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:17.938
So this guy's discrete.

00:28:17.938 --> 00:28:19.680
This guy is continuous.

00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:20.180
Right.

00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:21.760
Indeed when we're taking
about the numbers,

00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:23.343
then we should get--
it's a geometric.

00:28:23.343 --> 00:28:27.592
But often we're kind of a little
bit loose about these things.

00:28:27.592 --> 00:28:29.550
So it's not a disaster
if you said exponential.

00:28:29.550 --> 00:28:32.180
But the key thing is
that the distribution

00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:34.380
looks something like--
so now I've certainly

00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:35.930
drawn it as an exponential.

00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:39.250
This is the probability
of n as a function of n.

00:28:39.250 --> 00:28:41.430
Of course, the geometric
thing it looks--

00:28:44.322 --> 00:28:45.286
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:28:45.286 --> 00:28:49.079
So why should we expect
that distribution?

00:28:49.079 --> 00:28:51.120
PROFESSOR: Why should we
expect the distribution?

00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:52.620
So one answer is
that because that's

00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:53.940
what you read on Tuesday.

00:28:53.940 --> 00:29:02.740
But let's go ahead and--
yes, but let's go ahead

00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:04.300
and calculate it.

00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:05.020
That's useful.

00:29:07.530 --> 00:29:09.280
The way to think about
this, in some ways,

00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:11.060
there's another way
to write this perhaps.

00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:12.925
Which is that imagine
you have an mRNA.

00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:20.270
Now at some rate it's
going to be degraded.

00:29:20.270 --> 00:29:22.460
And maybe we'll keep the
degradation rate down,

00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:27.320
just for-- so there's
a degradation rate.

00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:30.090
But then if you'd like, we
could draw it like this.

00:29:30.090 --> 00:29:33.885
Where this is the synthesis
rate for a protein.

00:29:33.885 --> 00:29:36.310
And out pops a protein.

00:29:39.704 --> 00:29:42.120
And so the idea is that is
here we're in some state where,

00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:44.540
OK, here we have an mRNA.

00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:46.495
Here's the state where
we don't have an mRNA.

00:29:46.495 --> 00:29:48.620
Now this is the competition
between those two rates

00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:49.780
that I was telling you about.

00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:51.613
There is some degradation
rate for the mRNA.

00:29:51.613 --> 00:29:54.040
Or there's a synthesis rate
where we go around this loop.

00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:55.550
If we come around this
loop, we come back

00:29:55.550 --> 00:29:56.700
to the state with an mRNA.

00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:58.090
There still is an mRNA intact.

00:29:58.090 --> 00:30:00.776
Just out pops a protein.

00:30:00.776 --> 00:30:02.150
So then what we
want to do, is we

00:30:02.150 --> 00:30:06.310
want to think about what's
the number of proteins

00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:07.929
that we expect,
not just the mean,

00:30:07.929 --> 00:30:09.095
but the actual distribution.

00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:16.980
So it's useful in
these situations

00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:25.185
to define some probability
rho, which is the probability

00:30:25.185 --> 00:30:27.360
you actually, if
you're here, it's

00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:32.110
the probability that you
produce one protein at least.

00:30:32.110 --> 00:30:34.930
The question is, which
path do you take initially.

00:30:34.930 --> 00:30:36.620
Well that's just
given by the ratios.

00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:39.980
So there's the rate that we
take this circular path divided

00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:42.120
by the sum of these
two other rates.

00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:49.710
And then what we can
do is we can ask, well

00:30:49.710 --> 00:30:55.570
what is the probability that
0 proteins are produced,

00:30:55.570 --> 00:30:58.420
probability that we get 0.

00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:02.700
Well if we take
this path initially,

00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:04.019
will we have 0 proteins?

00:31:04.019 --> 00:31:04.560
AUDIENCE: No.

00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:05.150
PROFESSOR: No.

00:31:05.150 --> 00:31:08.110
Right, so this
probability is indeed

00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:12.010
simply equal to the probability
that we do this first, which

00:31:12.010 --> 00:31:13.560
is 1 minus rho.

00:31:20.394 --> 00:31:22.310
Now what's the probably
that we get 1 protein?

00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:24.640
Well, only 1?

00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:28.740
That's equal to the probability
that we first take this path,

00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:30.682
and then we take this path.

00:31:30.682 --> 00:31:32.390
Well we can multiply
those probabilities.

00:31:32.390 --> 00:31:35.350
Because we first take
the circular path

00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:36.770
to make a protein.

00:31:36.770 --> 00:31:39.920
And then we take the
degradation path.

00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:41.690
Well what's the
probability we get 2?

00:31:41.690 --> 00:31:44.110
Well that's just that we
come around here once,

00:31:44.110 --> 00:31:45.450
twice, and then degrade.

00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:52.830
Now if you're not
seeing a pattern here,

00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:54.840
then we're in trouble.

00:31:57.400 --> 00:31:58.910
So this says the
probability of n

00:31:58.910 --> 00:32:02.730
will then just be equal to
rho to the n, 1 minus rho.

00:32:08.850 --> 00:32:11.340
And indeed, it's
always useful in order

00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:13.370
to warm up your
probability muscles,

00:32:13.370 --> 00:32:17.880
to check to make sure that this
is a normalized probability

00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:18.830
distribution.

00:32:18.830 --> 00:32:25.820
So sum over all possible
ends indeed goes to 1.

00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:29.190
And that's just because the sum
over a bunch of rho to the n's

00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:32.440
is equal to 1 divided by 1 minus
rho, which is the term there.

00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:34.591
And that goes to 1.

00:32:34.591 --> 00:32:37.682
AUDIENCE: So this is making
a pretty strong assumption

00:32:37.682 --> 00:32:38.890
that they're all independent?

00:32:38.890 --> 00:32:41.180
PROFESSOR: Yep, yep.

00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:42.540
Yep.

00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:47.970
This is assuming that if you've
gone around once, you return.

00:32:47.970 --> 00:32:50.100
But I've come back to
the original state.

00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:51.962
AUDIENCE: But do
mRNAs like actually

00:32:51.962 --> 00:32:55.060
get caught in ribosomes--

00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:58.720
PROFESSOR: There are a lot
of things that can be true.

00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:03.972
And I would say that
in biology and in life,

00:33:03.972 --> 00:33:05.430
what you do is you
first write down

00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:06.790
the simplest possible model.

00:33:06.790 --> 00:33:08.540
And then you go and
you make measurements.

00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:12.300
And you ask whether the simplest
possible model can adequately

00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:13.380
explain the data.

00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:15.086
And if the answer
is no, then you're

00:33:15.086 --> 00:33:16.960
allowed to start thinking
about other things.

00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:19.770
Because everything's
is in principle true.

00:33:19.770 --> 00:33:22.400
In that mRNA, maybe
it's this or that.

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:24.130
The question is whether
it's significant.

00:33:24.130 --> 00:33:26.046
And at least from the
data from Sunney's group

00:33:26.046 --> 00:33:29.807
would say that in that
condition, in those cells,

00:33:29.807 --> 00:33:31.390
that those things
are not significant,

00:33:31.390 --> 00:33:33.950
in the sense that you still
get a geometric distribution.

00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:37.429
Of course it could also be that
those other things actually are

00:33:37.429 --> 00:33:38.470
true and are significant.

00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:41.120
But then you end up
with some new parameters

00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:45.260
that describe how things look as
a result of all the complexity.

00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:48.762
That's also OK in
the sense that I'd

00:33:48.762 --> 00:33:50.720
say that you can get a
quantitative description

00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:53.300
of the process by describing
it as a geometric with just

00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:54.580
a single free parameter.

00:33:54.580 --> 00:33:58.750
And they found that the mean
was four, or four or five.

00:33:58.750 --> 00:34:01.960
The mean number of proteins
produced from each mRNA.

00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:06.040
But they got this geometric
distribution in that paper.

00:34:10.809 --> 00:34:11.309
Yes?

00:34:15.159 --> 00:34:19.940
And I'll just mention
here that the mean of this

00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:21.730
is rho divided by 1 minus rho.

00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:26.860
So what you see is
that as rho goes to 1,

00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:29.060
then this thing is
going to diverge.

00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:30.050
And that makes sense.

00:34:30.050 --> 00:34:33.540
because as rho goes to 1, it's
saying that you essentially

00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:37.750
always synthesize another
protein rather than degrading.

00:34:37.750 --> 00:34:39.520
And before I move
on, I just want

00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:41.270
to say one more thing,
which is that there

00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:44.507
are many different definitions
of the geometric distribution,

00:34:44.507 --> 00:34:46.382
depending upon whether
the probability of rho

00:34:46.382 --> 00:34:47.390
is the probability
of terminating,

00:34:47.390 --> 00:34:49.640
or the probability of going
around, and also depending

00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:52.300
on whether you're asking
what is the-- here

00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:53.860
we're talking about
the probability

00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:56.320
distribution for the number
of proteins produced.

00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:57.690
Whereas we could have
talked about the probability

00:34:57.690 --> 00:35:00.148
distribution for the number of
times we go around this loop

00:35:00.148 --> 00:35:03.150
before, no, no sorry.

00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:05.200
That is for the number
of proteins produced.

00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:09.000
So the other way you could
have defined this is the number

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:14.960
of times where it's-- the number
of cycles that you had to go

00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:17.360
before you went here, in the
sense that if you first go

00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:19.756
here, you can either
call that a 0 or a 1.

00:35:19.756 --> 00:35:20.880
Do you see what I'm saying?

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:22.890
And reasonable
people can disagree.

00:35:22.890 --> 00:35:25.570
But you end up getting
distributions that are

00:35:25.570 --> 00:35:27.200
just a little bit different.

00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:28.250
So watch out.

00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:30.060
If you just memorize
something, you

00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:32.050
might have memorized
the equation

00:35:32.050 --> 00:35:35.240
for a different definition
of this distribution.

00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:38.780
Does everyone understand
what I tried to say there?

00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:39.380
Maybe?

00:35:39.380 --> 00:35:40.285
Yeah?

00:35:40.285 --> 00:35:41.826
AUDIENCE: When
there's no degradation

00:35:41.826 --> 00:35:43.492
is it still a Poisson?

00:35:43.492 --> 00:35:46.550
PROFESSOR: Ah, if there's no
degradation then would this

00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:48.040
be a Poisson?

00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:52.329
I mean, this would
be infinity, right?

00:35:52.329 --> 00:35:53.870
AUDIENCE: Right,
[INAUDIBLE] protein,

00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:57.216
this is done independently,
like there's an mRNA.

00:35:57.216 --> 00:35:59.620
[INAUDIBLE] proteins
independently.

00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:01.654
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:36:01.654 --> 00:36:02.570
So I want to be clear.

00:36:02.570 --> 00:36:08.000
This is, p of n is,
this is the probability

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:18.150
distribution for
number of proteins n,

00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:19.480
produced from a single mRNA.

00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:30.059
Now if there's no
degradation of the mRNA,

00:36:30.059 --> 00:36:31.600
then this thing is
not even, I think,

00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:35.940
defined in that the
number of proteins

00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:39.330
produced from that mRNA just
really goes to infinity.

00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:43.090
If you wanted to ask about
the probability distribution

00:36:43.090 --> 00:36:45.170
for the number of
proteins produced

00:36:45.170 --> 00:36:49.470
in some unit, some period
of time that would indeed

00:36:49.470 --> 00:36:53.410
be a Poisson
distribution, assuming

00:36:53.410 --> 00:36:56.210
that there's no degradation.

00:36:56.210 --> 00:36:58.972
Do you understand what
I'm trying to say?

00:36:58.972 --> 00:37:02.780
AUDIENCE: So Sp is like 0?

00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:06.330
PROFESSOR: If Sp, I'm sorry.

00:37:06.330 --> 00:37:07.872
If Sp were 0?

00:37:07.872 --> 00:37:09.038
AUDIENCE: Yeah. [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:21.367 --> 00:37:21.950
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:24.325
And you're saying that what
would be Poisson distributed?

00:37:24.325 --> 00:37:26.225
AUDIENCE: The
number of proteins.

00:37:36.090 --> 00:37:38.430
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I think
that actually-- no I

00:37:38.430 --> 00:37:41.940
think that-- I think that
you're probably right.

00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:45.176
That as Sp goes to 0-- I'm
a little bit worried that--

00:37:45.176 --> 00:37:46.050
AUDIENCE: No, no, no.

00:37:46.050 --> 00:37:46.670
Zero-th order, sorry.

00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:47.436
PROFESSOR: Oh.

00:37:47.436 --> 00:37:49.284
AUDIENCE: Not 0.

00:37:49.284 --> 00:37:52.220
[INAUDIBLE]

00:37:52.220 --> 00:37:53.135
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:37:53.135 --> 00:37:55.260
Right, so the mRNA distribution
we're about to find

00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:58.250
is indeed going to be a
Poisson at steady state.

00:37:58.250 --> 00:38:01.090
And so if there's some
process by which the protein

00:38:01.090 --> 00:38:02.980
distribution is
really just mirroring

00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:07.810
the mRNA distribution, then
it will also be Poisson.

00:38:07.810 --> 00:38:10.680
Although I think you have to be
careful about how you actually

00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:12.050
implement that.

00:38:12.050 --> 00:38:15.290
Because even in the absence
of this geometric bursting,

00:38:15.290 --> 00:38:17.390
different things, I
think, can happen.

00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:20.420
Because for example, if there
were exactly 10 proteins

00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:23.800
produced from each mRNA, then
that probability distribution

00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:26.240
is a shift.

00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:29.570
But then it's no
longer actually going

00:38:29.570 --> 00:38:33.150
to be Poisson, because the mean
and variance are going to scale

00:38:33.150 --> 00:38:35.450
differently if you do that.

00:38:35.450 --> 00:38:38.450
Let's maybe do the Poisson
distribution for the mRNA

00:38:38.450 --> 00:38:38.950
first.

00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:42.420
And then we can try
to touch back on this.

00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:49.790
So this is a plot of kind
of geometric distribution

00:38:49.790 --> 00:38:51.155
with a mean of 3-4-ish.

00:38:56.860 --> 00:39:00.312
Is everybody happy
with where we are now?

00:39:00.312 --> 00:39:02.060
OK.

00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:04.290
Now from this, what
we've said so far

00:39:04.290 --> 00:39:06.770
is it obvious what the
distribution of proteins

00:39:06.770 --> 00:39:08.580
will be in a cell?

00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:10.080
We can say obvious, yes.

00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:12.920
Or not obvious, no.

00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:15.330
Ready, just verbal, yes?

00:39:15.330 --> 00:39:16.020
Ready or no?

00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:16.520
All right.

00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:17.020
Ready?

00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:17.690
Three, two, one.

00:39:17.690 --> 00:39:18.317
AUDIENCE: No.

00:39:18.317 --> 00:39:18.900
PROFESSOR: No.

00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:19.570
Right.

00:39:19.570 --> 00:39:22.560
So we've said that
the distribution

00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:25.116
of size of protein bursts
from single mRNA is geometric.

00:39:25.116 --> 00:39:26.490
But that doesn't
mean that that's

00:39:26.490 --> 00:39:29.919
going to be the distribution
of proteins in the cell.

00:39:29.919 --> 00:39:31.460
And indeed after,
we're going to find

00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:33.790
that the distribution of
mRNA is going to be Poisson.

00:39:33.790 --> 00:39:35.830
But even then it's not
obvious what the distribution

00:39:35.830 --> 00:39:36.455
of proteins is.

00:39:47.410 --> 00:39:47.910
All right.

00:39:47.910 --> 00:39:49.410
So what we want to
do now is we want

00:39:49.410 --> 00:39:51.390
to introduce kind of a
simple version of what's

00:39:51.390 --> 00:39:52.650
known as the Master Equation.

00:39:55.390 --> 00:39:58.010
Now you guys are going to
do more reading on this

00:39:58.010 --> 00:40:00.330
for the lecture on Tuesday.

00:40:00.330 --> 00:40:03.080
Where we're going to talk about
the Master Equation, as well

00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:06.310
as the Fokker-Planck
approximation.

00:40:06.310 --> 00:40:08.620
Maybe the Gillespie
algorithm, and so forth.

00:40:08.620 --> 00:40:13.380
But I want to start by
thinking about the this notion

00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:15.084
in the simplest
possible context.

00:40:15.084 --> 00:40:16.500
So what we're going
to do is we're

00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:18.580
going to think about the world.

00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:21.550
So we want to know the steady
state, or the equilibrium

00:40:21.550 --> 00:40:26.170
distribution of mRNA numbers in
the cell, given this process.

00:40:26.170 --> 00:40:27.400
So that's great.

00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:31.630
We can-- so mRNA
distribution, question mark.

00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:43.520
Now in this case we don't
care about Sp, delta p,

00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:47.032
because the only things that are
relevant are going to be these.

00:40:47.032 --> 00:40:48.490
Now what we're
going to do is we're

00:40:48.490 --> 00:40:50.830
going to think about the
world in which we just

00:40:50.830 --> 00:40:54.010
defined states corresponding
to the different numbers

00:40:54.010 --> 00:40:54.950
of these mRNAs.

00:40:57.860 --> 00:41:01.170
So there's a state
where there's 0.

00:41:01.170 --> 00:41:03.120
We can't go to the
left, less than 0,

00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:09.490
but we can go to the state where
there's 1, or the state where

00:41:09.490 --> 00:41:10.620
there's 2, and so forth.

00:41:16.340 --> 00:41:18.590
Now the description
here is supposed

00:41:18.590 --> 00:41:21.680
to be the analog
of this over there.

00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:25.094
So this is trying to
understand the situation where

00:41:25.094 --> 00:41:27.010
the deterministic equations
would be described

00:41:27.010 --> 00:41:32.050
by m dot is equal to
this some synthesis rate,

00:41:32.050 --> 00:41:35.600
minus a degradation rate that's
proportional to the number,

00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:39.186
so minus delta m times m.

00:41:42.590 --> 00:41:46.880
So what you can see is that
the deterministic equations

00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:49.010
are very simple.

00:41:49.010 --> 00:41:51.296
We already calculated
the equilibrium.

00:41:51.296 --> 00:41:52.670
So when this thing
is equal to 0,

00:41:52.670 --> 00:41:55.185
then we get that m
equilibrium is just

00:41:55.185 --> 00:41:57.810
going to equal to the synthesis
rate divided by the degradation

00:41:57.810 --> 00:41:58.309
rate.

00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:03.830
If we're away from
the equilibrium

00:42:03.830 --> 00:42:05.836
in this deterministic
approximation,

00:42:05.836 --> 00:42:07.460
how long is it going
to take us to kind

00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:10.640
of approach our equilibrium?

00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:11.610
Verbal answer, ready?

00:42:11.610 --> 00:42:13.100
Three, two, one.

00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:14.192
[STUDENTS RESPOND]

00:42:14.192 --> 00:42:14.900
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:17.130
So it's going to
be 1 over delta m.

00:42:17.130 --> 00:42:20.320
So this tells us the
characteristic timescale

00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:21.160
to come back.

00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:28.015
So if we're-- this is the
equilibrium Sm over delta m.

00:42:28.015 --> 00:42:31.570
This is m as a function of time.

00:42:31.570 --> 00:42:32.980
If we're below, we come here.

00:42:32.980 --> 00:42:35.070
If we're above, we come here.

00:42:35.070 --> 00:42:41.686
And this time is 1 over delta m.

00:42:41.686 --> 00:42:43.202
Are the any questions about?

00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:53.130
Now this-- so I
want to highlight

00:42:53.130 --> 00:42:58.640
that this is like the world's
simplest dynamical equation,

00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:01.654
almost the world's simplest.

00:43:01.654 --> 00:43:03.820
Yet what we're going to
find is that once we go over

00:43:03.820 --> 00:43:05.695
and we try to understand
the full probability

00:43:05.695 --> 00:43:08.320
distribution of the
stochastic system

00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:10.470
then it's a little
bit more complicated.

00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:13.140
In particular, we end
up with an infinite set

00:43:13.140 --> 00:43:15.710
of differential equations.

00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:18.640
So in general the
Master Equation format,

00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:21.380
where we're going to write
differential equations for how

00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:25.530
these probabilities
change over time.

00:43:25.530 --> 00:43:28.350
Now what we've done is we've
traded a single differential

00:43:28.350 --> 00:43:31.170
equation for an infinite number
of differential equations.

00:43:31.170 --> 00:43:33.650
So that's a bummer.

00:43:33.650 --> 00:43:36.210
But on the other
hand, it will allow

00:43:36.210 --> 00:43:39.830
us to do the full
stochastic treatment.

00:43:39.830 --> 00:43:42.341
And it's also a nice, to
me, the master equation

00:43:42.341 --> 00:43:43.590
is useful in kind of two ways.

00:43:43.590 --> 00:43:46.610
One is that it's going
to be a tool for us to do

00:43:46.610 --> 00:43:48.110
analytic calculations.

00:43:48.110 --> 00:43:51.010
But it's also kind
of a principled way

00:43:51.010 --> 00:43:53.300
of organizing your thoughts
so that you can go and do

00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:55.860
stochastic simulations, if
that's what you want to do.

00:43:55.860 --> 00:43:58.240
So it's also just kind
of like a weigh station

00:43:58.240 --> 00:44:01.150
to kind of help you
set up your simulation.

00:44:15.754 --> 00:44:17.170
So what we're going
to do is we're

00:44:17.170 --> 00:44:20.260
going to ask about
the general way

00:44:20.260 --> 00:44:23.240
that this thing is going to
move between different states.

00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:26.390
In particular, we
are going to have

00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:29.950
some general state in here.

00:44:29.950 --> 00:44:35.365
Mn, which can go forward
or back, Mn plus 1.

00:44:47.060 --> 00:44:50.700
Now what we want to do is think
about how those probabilities

00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:53.970
are going to change over time.

00:44:53.970 --> 00:44:57.640
So we typically have fn.

00:44:57.640 --> 00:45:04.040
So this is often written
as an fn and fn minus 1.

00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:06.710
And then this is a g.

00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:09.040
I want to make sure I get
the n's and n minus ones

00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:09.836
correct here.

00:45:13.030 --> 00:45:17.890
Typically we write
gm plus 1, gn.

00:45:17.890 --> 00:45:21.205
So these are telling
us about the rates

00:45:21.205 --> 00:45:25.350
of being in this state,
with say, n mRNAs, as

00:45:25.350 --> 00:45:27.190
compared to going here.

00:45:27.190 --> 00:45:28.860
We're going here.

00:45:28.860 --> 00:45:31.260
So then what we can
do is we can write

00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:41.560
the change in the probability
of mn with respect to time.

00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:43.750
Well there are just
a few different ways

00:45:43.750 --> 00:45:45.890
that the probability can change.

00:45:45.890 --> 00:45:49.280
So we can leave the state
in two different ways.

00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:51.955
fn, gn.

00:45:55.210 --> 00:45:58.460
So the way that we
lose the probability

00:45:58.460 --> 00:46:03.840
is that we have fn plus
gn times the probability

00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:06.426
that we are in mn.

00:46:06.426 --> 00:46:08.285
That's an n there.

00:46:08.285 --> 00:46:09.910
And then there are
going to be two ways

00:46:09.910 --> 00:46:11.660
that we gain probability.

00:46:11.660 --> 00:46:14.260
We can gain probably
from the mn minus 1.

00:46:14.260 --> 00:46:21.450
So this is fn minus 1,
plus we can get probability

00:46:21.450 --> 00:46:22.960
from the upper state.

00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:30.440
That's a gn plus 1 mn plus 1.

00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:33.590
So this is just saying that
the change in the probability

00:46:33.590 --> 00:46:36.470
of being in this state is going
to be given by the probability

00:46:36.470 --> 00:46:38.061
that we leave the state.

00:46:38.061 --> 00:46:38.560
Sorry.

00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:40.710
The probability that
we enter the state,

00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:42.376
minus the probability
that we're leaving

00:46:42.376 --> 00:46:46.200
the state, kind of the rates.

00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:48.570
Now this is going to
be true for all n,

00:46:48.570 --> 00:46:51.220
except for n equal to
zero, we don't have

00:46:51.220 --> 00:46:54.330
the terms over on the left.

00:46:54.330 --> 00:46:58.170
So this is kind of for all n.

00:46:58.170 --> 00:47:00.630
So this is, in
particular this is for n,

00:47:00.630 --> 00:47:03.250
basically 0 on up to infinity.

00:47:03.250 --> 00:47:06.480
So this is a differential
equation for the probability

00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:07.700
for having an mRNA.

00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:11.790
But this is, we have to have a
different equation for each n,

00:47:11.790 --> 00:47:13.830
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 on up.

00:47:16.510 --> 00:47:20.890
So this is what I mean by
converting single differential

00:47:20.890 --> 00:47:24.990
equation, which is actually an
exceedingly simple one, for one

00:47:24.990 --> 00:47:26.335
that is for an infinite set.

00:47:26.335 --> 00:47:28.460
And each one is even a
little bit more complicated.

00:47:28.460 --> 00:47:33.400
In general, these f's and n's
can be pretty complicated.

00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:37.450
In this situation
they're not so bad.

00:47:37.450 --> 00:47:40.520
But let's make sure.

00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:44.470
Can somebody say what
fn and gn are equal to?

00:47:51.830 --> 00:47:54.144
Any volunteers?

00:47:54.144 --> 00:47:56.000
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:00.670
PROFESSOR: Right so fn, this
is rate that we add a new mRNA.

00:48:00.670 --> 00:48:04.450
Well that's just
synthesis rate for mRNA.

00:48:04.450 --> 00:48:06.774
And this guy is what?

00:48:06.774 --> 00:48:08.686
AUDIENCE: Delta.

00:48:08.686 --> 00:48:10.310
PROFESSOR: So this
is degradation rate.

00:48:10.310 --> 00:48:14.598
And we actually do have to
multiply still by the number n.

00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:22.100
And that's because as we go
further out here to the right,

00:48:22.100 --> 00:48:23.540
then it is true.

00:48:23.540 --> 00:48:26.140
The rate at which we come back
to the left is increasing.

00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:28.670
Because there's just more
mRNA that can be degraded.

00:48:32.010 --> 00:48:37.540
Now it's worth saying that
you can, for example, use

00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:39.880
this to simulate the
probability distribution

00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:41.850
if you start from any
distribution you like.

00:48:41.850 --> 00:48:44.370
So for example, you could
start M0 equal to 1.

00:48:44.370 --> 00:48:48.210
And then just simulate how
the probability recalibrates

00:48:48.210 --> 00:48:50.740
and comes over here.

00:48:50.740 --> 00:48:52.340
Similarly, you could
do it over here.

00:48:52.340 --> 00:48:54.030
You could start with any
probability distribution

00:48:54.030 --> 00:48:54.590
you want.

00:48:54.590 --> 00:48:56.375
And you could use
this as a framework

00:48:56.375 --> 00:48:58.500
to calculate what the
probability distribution will

00:48:58.500 --> 00:48:59.620
be at any time later.

00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:05.460
But you can also use
this just as a way

00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:09.950
of figuring out what the
equilibrium distribution is

00:49:09.950 --> 00:49:10.450
going to be.

00:49:10.450 --> 00:49:14.040
Because at equilibrium,
we can just ask,

00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:15.915
for each one of these
arrows, the probability

00:49:15.915 --> 00:49:18.289
of moving to the right has to
be equal to the probability

00:49:18.289 --> 00:49:21.070
of moving to the left, otherwise
we wouldn't be at equilibrium.

00:49:21.070 --> 00:49:24.202
And that's true for every one of
these kinds of pairs of arrows.

00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:32.090
And in particular,
what we can get,

00:49:32.090 --> 00:49:34.555
and I want to make
sure that-- so but it's

00:49:34.555 --> 00:49:45.360
not that fn is equal to gn--
so it's really going to end up

00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:47.600
being that if you
see what fn and gn,

00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:56.680
so that fn is going to have
to be equal to g of n plus 1

00:49:56.680 --> 00:49:57.350
for all n.

00:49:57.350 --> 00:49:58.320
Yes?

00:49:58.320 --> 00:50:00.260
AUDIENCE: Do you
also need to multiply

00:50:00.260 --> 00:50:01.715
like natural probabilities--

00:50:01.715 --> 00:50:05.860
PROFESSOR: Ah, Yes, yes, indeed.

00:50:05.860 --> 00:50:11.100
So that sorry, times
mn times m of n plus 1.

00:50:14.870 --> 00:50:19.700
So it's the kind of probably
flux so we have to equalize.

00:50:19.700 --> 00:50:23.780
So this is nice because this
gives us a ratio of things.

00:50:23.780 --> 00:50:26.440
In particular, this tells
us that the probability

00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:29.810
of being in the n plus 1 divided
by the probability of being n,

00:50:29.810 --> 00:50:31.350
and this is at equilibrium.

00:50:36.330 --> 00:50:44.130
Is going to be fn
divided by gn plus 1.

00:50:44.130 --> 00:50:46.830
Which is this synthesis rate.

00:50:46.830 --> 00:50:49.710
And then down here is going
to be this degradation rate

00:50:49.710 --> 00:50:53.300
times, in this case, n plus 1.

00:51:00.300 --> 00:51:01.430
So this is useful.

00:51:01.430 --> 00:51:04.790
Because for example,
if we start at m,

00:51:04.790 --> 00:51:11.240
we could say that m1
over m0-- well maybe

00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:14.330
we'll even put the
m0 over on the right.

00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:19.330
So then m1, what
is that equal to?

00:51:19.330 --> 00:51:21.650
That's going to be
synthesis rate divided

00:51:21.650 --> 00:51:28.010
degradation rate, times m0.

00:51:28.010 --> 00:51:33.420
But then we also know that m2,
well that's going to be again,

00:51:33.420 --> 00:51:35.596
synthesis rate divided
by degradation rate.

00:51:35.596 --> 00:51:36.970
And we're going
to get a squared.

00:51:36.970 --> 00:51:42.550
But then now we have to
divide by 1/2 times m0.

00:51:42.550 --> 00:51:51.600
Continuing on, m3 we get
Sm over delta m cubed,

00:51:51.600 --> 00:51:55.750
divided by 1 over
3 times 2 times m0.

00:51:58.830 --> 00:52:01.200
So in general, we
get the probability

00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:05.870
of being in the nth state,
is going to be this thing.

00:52:05.870 --> 00:52:10.480
We'll call it lambda for now.

00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:14.350
Lambda to the n, divided
by n factorial, times m0.

00:52:19.980 --> 00:52:24.280
Now what's the-- and
I'll-- remember lambda here

00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:28.426
we've defined it to be
the ratio Sm over delta m.

00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:33.840
Now if we sum over all
these probabilities,

00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:35.800
what should we get?

00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:36.300
AUDIENCE: 1.

00:52:36.300 --> 00:52:37.460
PROFESSOR: 1.

00:52:37.460 --> 00:52:42.620
Right, if we sum over this
thing, what does that equal to?

00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:48.200
It's what?

00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:49.640
AUDIENCE: Eta lambda.

00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:51.100
PROFESSOR: Eta lambda, right?

00:52:51.100 --> 00:52:57.750
So just remember in this
world-- the sum over lambda

00:52:57.750 --> 00:53:03.490
to the n, n factorial, from
n equal to 0 to infinity,

00:53:03.490 --> 00:53:05.570
this is indeed the definition
of e to the lambda.

00:53:08.420 --> 00:53:11.055
So what that means is that
the normalization condition is

00:53:11.055 --> 00:53:19.951
that m0 has to be equal to e
to the minus lambda, which is

00:53:19.951 --> 00:53:21.200
indeed a Poisson distribution.

00:53:30.548 --> 00:53:32.332
I'll raise it up a little bit.

00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:39.160
So this is saying,
OK, to back up.

00:53:39.160 --> 00:53:42.390
If we just have constant rate
of creation of something,

00:53:42.390 --> 00:53:44.910
constant rate of
degradation of that thing,

00:53:44.910 --> 00:53:47.720
on a per item basis,
per unit basis,

00:53:47.720 --> 00:53:51.050
then you end up getting
a Poisson distribution,

00:53:51.050 --> 00:53:54.760
at equilibrium for the
number of that thing,

00:53:54.760 --> 00:53:57.310
in this case, the number
of mRNA in the cell.

00:54:04.310 --> 00:54:05.940
Questions about why that is?

00:54:05.940 --> 00:54:07.700
What happened?

00:54:07.700 --> 00:54:08.620
How we calculate it?

00:54:11.931 --> 00:54:13.823
AUDIENCE: Could you
explain why [INAUDIBLE]?

00:54:16.954 --> 00:54:17.620
PROFESSOR: Sure.

00:54:24.440 --> 00:54:28.810
So this is basically f of n.

00:54:28.810 --> 00:54:30.850
And this is basically
this g of n.

00:54:30.850 --> 00:54:35.530
But remember here n is
the number of proteins

00:54:35.530 --> 00:54:37.550
or the number of mRNA.

00:54:37.550 --> 00:54:42.480
So then that's in the context
of the master equation,

00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:43.900
then m and n are there.

00:54:43.900 --> 00:54:46.416
You get n by the
current number of m.

00:54:46.416 --> 00:54:47.290
Does that make sense?

00:54:51.250 --> 00:54:53.270
Yes?

00:54:53.270 --> 00:54:57.546
AUDIENCE: I'm confused how
you changed m0 to the e

00:54:57.546 --> 00:54:58.920
to the minus lambda.

00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:00.940
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:55:00.940 --> 00:55:03.130
Well let's just do it.

00:55:03.130 --> 00:55:09.890
So mn, this is the probability
that we observe n mRNA.

00:55:09.890 --> 00:55:13.610
And we know that
the sum over mn,

00:55:13.610 --> 00:55:18.335
so all these probabilities
from n equal to 0 to infinity,

00:55:18.335 --> 00:55:20.410
has to be equal to 1.

00:55:20.410 --> 00:55:22.970
Something has to happen.

00:55:22.970 --> 00:55:24.080
Well let's do this sum.

00:55:24.080 --> 00:55:27.380
This is equal to the
sum of lambda to the n,

00:55:27.380 --> 00:55:29.470
over n factorial m0.

00:55:32.890 --> 00:55:36.490
But m0, is this a function of n?

00:55:39.100 --> 00:55:39.690
No.

00:55:39.690 --> 00:55:42.480
m0 is just, this is just the
probability at equilibrium

00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:44.410
that you have 0 mRNA.

00:55:44.410 --> 00:55:46.479
So we can just pull
this thing out.

00:55:46.479 --> 00:55:48.270
This is just some
number, some probability.

00:55:54.560 --> 00:55:56.720
Now the statement is
that while this thing,

00:55:56.720 --> 00:55:59.610
this is the definition
of e to the lambda.

00:56:03.060 --> 00:56:08.160
So in general, so e to the x
we often write is equal to 1,

00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:12.633
plus x, plus x squared
over 2, plus dot, dot, dot.

00:56:16.190 --> 00:56:20.820
So this thing is indeed
just equal e to the lambda.

00:56:20.820 --> 00:56:24.370
So what we know is
that this is still 1.

00:56:24.370 --> 00:56:27.150
So m0 times e to the
lambda, is equal to 1,

00:56:27.150 --> 00:56:29.614
so m0 is to the minus lambda.

00:56:35.590 --> 00:56:38.750
Any other questions
about how we got here?

00:56:38.750 --> 00:56:40.182
What's going on?

00:56:40.182 --> 00:56:41.598
Yes?

00:56:41.598 --> 00:56:43.570
AUDIENCE: The plot
of the solution

00:56:43.570 --> 00:56:48.060
to the adjoining
equation, that would

00:56:48.060 --> 00:56:50.370
be like the mean
value, that would

00:56:50.370 --> 00:56:52.515
be the behavior of
the mean values?

00:56:52.515 --> 00:56:54.930
PROFESSOR: That Is
the expected behavior

00:56:54.930 --> 00:56:57.570
of the mean value over time.

00:56:57.570 --> 00:57:00.640
In this case, fn and gn
are both linear functions

00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:02.140
of the number of the mRNA.

00:57:02.140 --> 00:57:05.670
Which means that in the
context of the master equation,

00:57:05.670 --> 00:57:14.590
if you ask about the
expectation of mn,

00:57:14.590 --> 00:57:20.300
this quantity is indeed equal
to-- it has the same behavior

00:57:20.300 --> 00:57:28.210
as, over time, as the
deterministic equations.

00:57:28.210 --> 00:57:30.890
So if f and g are
nonlinear, then

00:57:30.890 --> 00:57:33.420
actually you get a deviation.

00:57:33.420 --> 00:57:35.750
But in this case, it
is indeed the same.

00:57:35.750 --> 00:57:41.230
What it means that
if you compare

00:57:41.230 --> 00:57:43.680
the stochastic and the
deterministic trajectories,

00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:45.900
what you would see
is that this thing

00:57:45.900 --> 00:57:51.040
is going to be a little
bit jagged, or whatnot.

00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:52.420
And then even at
equilibrium it's

00:57:52.420 --> 00:57:54.380
going to come up and
down a little bit.

00:57:54.380 --> 00:57:56.213
I'm trying to add a
little bit of jaggedness

00:57:56.213 --> 00:57:57.870
because it's discrete.

00:57:57.870 --> 00:58:01.230
But the deterministic
equation here

00:58:01.230 --> 00:58:03.630
is what you would get
if you average together

00:58:03.630 --> 00:58:07.549
an infinite number of these
stochastic trajectories.

00:58:07.549 --> 00:58:09.465
Because another one might
have come down here.

00:58:13.200 --> 00:58:15.938
Does that answer?

00:58:15.938 --> 00:58:18.686
AUDIENCE: Is m
playing a double role?

00:58:18.686 --> 00:58:20.186
Like in that
deterministic equation,

00:58:20.186 --> 00:58:22.210
m is the concentration of mRNA?

00:58:22.210 --> 00:58:25.410
PROFESSOR: I think that I'm--
yeah I think that I should--

00:58:25.410 --> 00:58:27.320
my nomenclature I think
was not very good.

00:58:27.320 --> 00:58:29.360
I've used two different things.

00:58:29.360 --> 00:58:30.880
And now that I'm
doing this, I think

00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:36.980
that I should have-- I should
have just called it p of n,

00:58:36.980 --> 00:58:38.965
or maybe I should've
used n here.

00:58:44.972 --> 00:58:46.930
I think I was trying to
be consistent with some

00:58:46.930 --> 00:58:49.340
of the previous, but I
think it was a mistake.

00:58:52.460 --> 00:58:53.927
Yes?

00:58:53.927 --> 00:58:55.510
AUDIENCE: Are you
plotting stochastic?

00:58:58.820 --> 00:59:05.720
PROFESSOR: I'm plotting--
OK, so no, I'm not.

00:59:05.720 --> 00:59:11.450
So this is if you run an
actual stochastic trajectory.

00:59:11.450 --> 00:59:13.180
Then at any moment
in time, you just

00:59:13.180 --> 00:59:16.830
have one-- there's
some number of mRNA.

00:59:16.830 --> 00:59:19.410
Whereas the sum
over the mn's, this

00:59:19.410 --> 00:59:21.290
is talking about the
probability distribution

00:59:21.290 --> 00:59:22.430
of the entire thing.

00:59:22.430 --> 00:59:25.580
So really if you started here,
the master equation would give

00:59:25.580 --> 00:59:30.550
you some distribution for the
n's, some distribution for m's.

00:59:30.550 --> 00:59:33.350
And so if you looked
at these over time,

00:59:33.350 --> 00:59:35.510
than the mean of
these distributions

00:59:35.510 --> 00:59:40.481
is indeed equal to the
deterministic behavior.

00:59:40.481 --> 00:59:40.980
Yes?

00:59:40.980 --> 00:59:43.230
AUDIENCE: Is it possible to
recover, like how would we

00:59:43.230 --> 00:59:47.631
recover the differential
equation from the master

00:59:47.631 --> 00:59:48.130
equation?

00:59:48.130 --> 00:59:49.280
Is that possible?

00:59:49.280 --> 00:59:50.630
Maybe that would help.

00:59:50.630 --> 00:59:52.760
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:59:52.760 --> 00:59:54.814
I think that in the
end, there's going

00:59:54.814 --> 00:59:56.730
to be a one-to-one
relationship from, I guess,

00:59:56.730 --> 01:00:00.230
this differential equation
to the master equation.

01:00:00.230 --> 01:00:01.999
I'm trying to think
of any weird case

01:00:01.999 --> 01:00:03.540
or something funny's
going to happen.

01:00:03.540 --> 01:00:04.830
Is something funny
going to happen?

01:00:04.830 --> 01:00:05.371
AUDIENCE: No.

01:00:05.371 --> 01:00:08.246
But like the easy way is just
to write them all in terms

01:00:08.246 --> 01:00:09.222
of the distribution.

01:00:09.222 --> 01:00:13.068
And you can just
differentiate the whole sum.

01:00:13.068 --> 01:00:17.460
And in that sum, we
express the [INAUDIBLE]

01:00:17.460 --> 01:00:20.388
with your last equation.

01:00:20.388 --> 01:00:23.022
[INAUDIBLE]

01:00:23.022 --> 01:00:23.730
PROFESSOR: Right.

01:00:23.730 --> 01:00:25.966
But I think this is the
much more mathematical way.

01:00:25.966 --> 01:00:27.590
I mean because I
think that actually, I

01:00:27.590 --> 01:00:31.810
mean, from the
differential equation, you

01:00:31.810 --> 01:00:34.440
actually from the terms
here, you can actually

01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:36.060
construct the master equation.

01:00:36.060 --> 01:00:39.544
And I think by the same way,
you can go from the master

01:00:39.544 --> 01:00:40.960
equation, and I
think that there's

01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:42.334
going to be a
unique differential

01:00:42.334 --> 01:00:44.950
equation that would have gotten
you to that master equation.

01:00:44.950 --> 01:00:46.990
So I think just from
the terms you can do it.

01:00:46.990 --> 01:00:49.530
You could also do like
moment generating functions

01:00:49.530 --> 01:00:51.620
to get to how things change.

01:00:51.620 --> 01:00:59.540
But I mean I think that it's
really from this, for example,

01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:04.050
I think it tells you that that
was the differential equation.

01:01:04.050 --> 01:01:06.980
Does that--

01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:10.100
I mean it's sort of--
the way that we typically

01:01:10.100 --> 01:01:12.350
do things these things, is
that we have a differential

01:01:12.350 --> 01:01:14.790
equation, and then we
construct the master equation.

01:01:14.790 --> 01:01:17.248
So then we already knew what
the differential equation was.

01:01:17.248 --> 01:01:20.100
But I think just from the
terms in your master equation,

01:01:20.100 --> 01:01:22.769
you can say, all right.

01:01:22.769 --> 01:01:25.102
This was the differential
equation that it started with.

01:01:31.486 --> 01:01:33.360
Any other questions
about what happened here?

01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:43.650
So we have, I think, a fair
number, a fair knowledge

01:01:43.650 --> 01:01:45.890
of what's going on here now.

01:01:45.890 --> 01:01:49.930
We know that the
equilibrium distribution

01:01:49.930 --> 01:01:52.620
of mRNA in the cell is
going to be Poisson.

01:01:52.620 --> 01:01:54.600
We also know that
the distribution

01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:57.230
of the number of mRNA produced
per sell cycle is also Poisson.

01:01:57.230 --> 01:02:00.600
But it's a different
Poisson from the first one.

01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:04.097
We know that the number of
proteins produced per mRNA

01:02:04.097 --> 01:02:05.805
is going to be
geometrically distributed.

01:02:08.775 --> 01:02:10.400
The one thing that
we have not yet done

01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:17.650
is to ask about the distribution
of protein in the cell.

01:02:17.650 --> 01:02:19.352
So let's say
something about that.

01:02:19.352 --> 01:02:21.060
I'm not going to do
the whole derivation.

01:02:21.060 --> 01:02:22.560
Because it's harder.

01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:27.180
But I encourage you to--
even the continuous version

01:02:27.180 --> 01:02:30.840
of the derivation is
definitely harder than this.

01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:36.620
But then the discrete
derivation is even worse.

01:02:36.620 --> 01:02:38.060
So what we're going
to talk about,

01:02:38.060 --> 01:02:39.530
and the way we'll
typically maybe

01:02:39.530 --> 01:02:41.613
think about this from the
standpoint of this class

01:02:41.613 --> 01:02:46.257
is the continuous
approximation to-- oh,

01:02:46.257 --> 01:02:47.840
that might have ended
up being useful.

01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:49.790
Well it's OK.

01:02:49.790 --> 01:02:54.499
Is the continuous approximation
to the real answer.

01:02:54.499 --> 01:02:56.790
And in particular, just the
way that the exponential is

01:02:56.790 --> 01:03:00.820
the continuous approximation
of the geometric distribution,

01:03:00.820 --> 01:03:04.370
in the same way you can
think about the equilibrium

01:03:04.370 --> 01:03:06.370
distribution of
protein in the cell.

01:03:06.370 --> 01:03:08.720
In this model is going
to be gamma distributed.

01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:11.110
But gamma is a
continuous distribution.

01:03:11.110 --> 01:03:17.880
But it's a continuous analog
of the negative binomial.

01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:33.401
So let me just make sure I'm--
and Sunney Xie actually has

01:03:33.401 --> 01:03:38.670
a nice PRL paper where he
derives the gamma distribution.

01:03:38.670 --> 01:03:40.970
But even earlier
actually Paulson

01:03:40.970 --> 01:03:43.700
had derived this negative
binomial distribution,

01:03:43.700 --> 01:03:45.690
the discrete version
of the solution.

01:03:56.910 --> 01:03:59.379
So this is the number
of protein per cell.

01:03:59.379 --> 01:04:00.420
We already know the mean.

01:04:04.870 --> 01:04:09.410
So this is approximately
distributed as a gamma.

01:04:09.410 --> 01:04:12.410
A gamma is a distribution
that requires two parameters

01:04:12.410 --> 01:04:13.330
to describe.

01:04:13.330 --> 01:04:17.230
So a Poisson can be described
by single parameter.

01:04:17.230 --> 01:04:19.150
Gamma is typically
described by two.

01:04:23.580 --> 01:04:29.806
And b is going to
be the burst size,

01:04:29.806 --> 01:04:43.390
whereas a is the mean number
of bursts per cell cycle, which

01:04:43.390 --> 01:04:45.850
is the same as the
mean number of mRNA

01:04:45.850 --> 01:04:47.500
produced, so mean
number of bursts.

01:04:56.670 --> 01:05:00.080
So the gamma of this a, b.

01:05:18.850 --> 01:05:19.350
All right.

01:05:19.350 --> 01:05:23.920
So the gamma of a is
the gamma function.

01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:29.360
It's equal to-- now is
it a minus 1 factorial?

01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:31.770
I always get the-- is it a
minus 1 or a plus 1 factorial.

01:05:31.770 --> 01:05:33.590
Anybody remember this?

01:05:33.590 --> 01:05:34.370
Yeah, a minus 1.

01:05:43.830 --> 01:05:45.290
I mean it's like
a lot of things.

01:05:45.290 --> 01:05:46.740
You look at this equation.

01:05:46.740 --> 01:05:48.980
It doesn't really
mean a whole lot.

01:05:48.980 --> 01:05:51.540
But I think that a reasonable
way to think about this

01:05:51.540 --> 01:05:55.810
is the gamma is
approximately what

01:05:55.810 --> 01:06:02.260
you get when you add together
a different exponentials

01:06:02.260 --> 01:06:06.515
with length scale, given by b.

01:06:06.515 --> 01:06:08.140
When you add probability
distributions,

01:06:08.140 --> 01:06:09.909
you have to do a convolution.

01:06:09.909 --> 01:06:11.700
So in some ways, the
way to think about it,

01:06:11.700 --> 01:06:12.908
and this kind of makes sense.

01:06:12.908 --> 01:06:15.720
Because what is
happening is that it

01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:18.631
takes something of
order cell division time

01:06:18.631 --> 01:06:19.880
for these proteins to go away.

01:06:19.880 --> 01:06:22.200
Because they're stable.

01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:25.070
Now each-- and so then
what you want to know

01:06:25.070 --> 01:06:27.200
is how many proteins
are kind of produced

01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:30.200
over the course of a cell cycle.

01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:36.144
Well that actually you can get
at by asking how many bursts

01:06:36.144 --> 01:06:37.060
are there going to be.

01:06:37.060 --> 01:06:38.430
And then how big are the bursts?

01:06:41.450 --> 01:06:47.580
So indeed, the mean here
is equal to a times b.

01:06:47.580 --> 01:06:50.860
And the variance is equal
to a times b squared.

01:06:56.551 --> 01:06:58.550
So for example, if you
have a single exponential

01:06:58.550 --> 01:07:06.270
distribution, with burst size
b, then this is what you get.

01:07:06.270 --> 01:07:09.820
So this is the probability
that you get n proteins.

01:07:09.820 --> 01:07:11.500
And this is this function of n.

01:07:11.500 --> 01:07:15.500
So for a single burst, this
is exponentially distributed.

01:07:15.500 --> 01:07:18.990
So this is the
continuous version.

01:07:18.990 --> 01:07:22.830
Now if we add together
multiple of these bursts,

01:07:22.830 --> 01:07:25.330
this is really saying that we
sample from this distribution,

01:07:25.330 --> 01:07:26.240
say twice.

01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:29.120
And then we add the
resulting value.

01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:30.790
So this is a convolution.

01:07:30.790 --> 01:07:32.500
You guys will have
an opportunity

01:07:32.500 --> 01:07:35.310
to practice this on
your problem sets.

01:07:35.310 --> 01:07:36.910
But what happens
is that you end up

01:07:36.910 --> 01:07:39.660
getting something that looks
like-- it's going to go.

01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:44.380
So it increases linearly.

01:07:44.380 --> 01:07:46.470
If you added three
of them together

01:07:46.470 --> 01:07:47.871
this increase is quadratic.

01:07:47.871 --> 01:07:49.120
And it kind of goes like that.

01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:52.415
So this thing
becomes kind of-- it

01:07:52.415 --> 01:07:54.652
goes from a
distribution where it's

01:07:54.652 --> 01:07:57.110
peaked at 0, to something that's
peaked at a nonzero value.

01:08:00.060 --> 01:08:02.660
Now you can ask,
for example, what

01:08:02.660 --> 01:08:09.810
happens as for a large a,
if you have many bursts,

01:08:09.810 --> 01:08:11.330
what does this thing look like?

01:08:11.330 --> 01:08:14.415
Oh, I wish I hadn't erased
my probability distributions.

01:08:17.290 --> 01:08:22.233
So what are the gamma
converged to for large a?

01:08:22.233 --> 01:08:23.149
A normal distribution.

01:08:23.149 --> 01:08:23.950
Right?

01:08:23.950 --> 01:08:26.359
So that's the central
limit theorem.

01:08:26.359 --> 01:08:28.939
If you take any well-behaved
probability distribution,

01:08:28.939 --> 01:08:29.649
you add it.

01:08:29.649 --> 01:08:31.821
You sample from it many times.

01:08:31.821 --> 01:08:33.279
Then you end up
getting a Gaussian.

01:08:38.528 --> 01:08:40.069
If you don't remember
that very well,

01:08:40.069 --> 01:08:43.580
then this is something to
read about over the weekend.

01:08:49.109 --> 01:08:50.580
Just like the
Poisson is also going

01:08:50.580 --> 01:08:57.745
to go to-- for large
lambda, the Poisson

01:08:57.745 --> 01:08:58.870
also looks like a Gaussian.

01:08:58.870 --> 01:09:00.330
Can somebody give
an explanation,

01:09:00.330 --> 01:09:03.500
an intuitive explanation
for why that should be?

01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:06.773
Why it-- yes?

01:09:06.773 --> 01:09:08.697
AUDIENCE: Because in a
Poisson distribution,

01:09:08.697 --> 01:09:10.307
you can't have
anything negative.

01:09:10.307 --> 01:09:10.890
PROFESSOR: OK.

01:09:10.890 --> 01:09:12.848
So a Poisson distribution
can't have anything--

01:09:12.848 --> 01:09:14.970
but now I feel like
you're arguing against me.

01:09:14.970 --> 01:09:17.579
Because a Gaussian has
negative values, right?

01:09:17.579 --> 01:09:18.245
AUDIENCE: Right.

01:09:18.245 --> 01:09:22.946
So when the mean is really
small, only have [INAUDIBLE].

01:09:22.946 --> 01:09:23.529
PROFESSOR: OK.

01:09:23.529 --> 01:09:24.100
Yeah.

01:09:24.100 --> 01:09:24.990
All right.

01:09:24.990 --> 01:09:28.755
So what you're saying is
that Poisson for small lambda

01:09:28.755 --> 01:09:30.035
it can't go negative.

01:09:32.221 --> 01:09:32.720
OK.

01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:35.568
No I think that that's true.

01:09:35.568 --> 01:09:37.609
Yeah, and so somehow the
probability distribution

01:09:37.609 --> 01:09:39.974
is somehow piling
up, as you say.

01:09:39.974 --> 01:09:41.974
What are some other ways
of thinking about this?

01:09:50.463 --> 01:09:51.379
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:10:00.289 --> 01:10:04.744
Because if you have a low lambda
that means it's a Poisson.

01:10:04.744 --> 01:10:08.704
And then I'm just
imagining stretching out.

01:10:08.704 --> 01:10:09.240
[INAUDIBLE]

01:10:12.137 --> 01:10:12.720
PROFESSOR: OK.

01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:14.051
So I think that's fair.

01:10:14.051 --> 01:10:15.550
Another way we can
think about this,

01:10:15.550 --> 01:10:17.425
is let's say that we
have some process that's

01:10:17.425 --> 01:10:20.600
occurring randomly over
some period of time.

01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:23.470
And this could be
say, mRNA production.

01:10:23.470 --> 01:10:26.250
And here this is just the
number that we observe here,

01:10:26.250 --> 01:10:29.580
this is going to be a Poisson,
with some mean lambda.

01:10:29.580 --> 01:10:33.580
Now let's just say that I take
another one, same process,

01:10:33.580 --> 01:10:34.520
same period of time.

01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:36.186
How is this guy going
to be distributed?

01:10:38.229 --> 01:10:39.520
So this also Poisson of lambda.

01:10:43.430 --> 01:10:47.740
Now let's say I take this
probability distribution,

01:10:47.740 --> 01:10:49.970
and I take this
probability distribution.

01:10:49.970 --> 01:10:52.259
And I convolve them.

01:10:52.259 --> 01:10:54.050
I'm going to do the
calculation of my head.

01:10:54.050 --> 01:10:57.100
I did it.

01:10:57.100 --> 01:11:02.410
So for those of you who haven't
done convolutions-- whatever.

01:11:02.410 --> 01:11:04.380
Yes, what's the new
distribution going to be?

01:11:11.380 --> 01:11:13.242
Poisson 2 lambda.

01:11:13.242 --> 01:11:14.450
And why does that have to be?

01:11:16.306 --> 01:11:18.306
AUDIENCE: That line was
sort of you put it by n.

01:11:21.690 --> 01:11:22.370
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:11:22.370 --> 01:11:22.911
That's right.

01:11:22.911 --> 01:11:25.100
This line, I just kind of
like I just made it up.

01:11:25.100 --> 01:11:25.990
I could have just said, oh.

01:11:25.990 --> 01:11:27.948
Well it's the same process
occurring over here.

01:11:27.948 --> 01:11:29.247
So we have to have the mean.

01:11:29.247 --> 01:11:31.080
It's still is going to
be a Poisson process.

01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:35.085
And the mean has to
be the-- well we just

01:11:35.085 --> 01:11:35.960
had twice the length.

01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:38.210
And indeed, for independent
probability distributions,

01:11:38.210 --> 01:11:39.655
means always add.

01:11:39.655 --> 01:11:41.780
So this all consistent will
all the things we know.

01:11:41.780 --> 01:11:43.690
So this has to be a
Poisson of 2 lambda.

01:11:43.690 --> 01:11:45.370
If I add another
segment on here,

01:11:45.370 --> 01:11:47.600
it has to Poisson of 3 lambda.

01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:51.590
But what you see is that we see
that Poisson of n lambda, which

01:11:51.590 --> 01:11:52.840
is the sum over many Poissons.

01:11:55.724 --> 01:11:57.890
Poissons are well-behaved
probability distributions.

01:11:57.890 --> 01:11:58.560
You add them
together, you're going

01:11:58.560 --> 01:11:59.990
to have to get a Gaussian.

01:11:59.990 --> 01:12:02.840
So you can see that the
Poisson has to become

01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:03.940
Gaussian for large lambda.

01:12:03.940 --> 01:12:05.010
And indeed it does.

01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:11.660
So there's a comment
about this in the--

01:12:11.660 --> 01:12:13.950
AUDIENCE: It's a little bit
more complicated than this

01:12:13.950 --> 01:12:16.990
because obviously you
always just divide

01:12:16.990 --> 01:12:18.430
from lambda [INAUDIBLE].

01:12:21.895 --> 01:12:24.617
Like you would have to say
that Poisson lambda is just

01:12:24.617 --> 01:12:28.340
like a combination of S--

01:12:28.340 --> 01:12:29.410
PROFESSOR: OK.

01:12:29.410 --> 01:12:31.860
You're saying that if I do
this calculation backwards,

01:12:31.860 --> 01:12:32.710
I'm going to get into trouble.

01:12:32.710 --> 01:12:34.043
Because if I try to break them--

01:12:34.043 --> 01:12:36.689
AUDIENCE: So if you
require lambda to be-- you

01:12:36.689 --> 01:12:39.736
have to have like a significant
probability of getting at least

01:12:39.736 --> 01:12:40.970
one candidate, right?

01:12:40.970 --> 01:12:45.670
PROFESSOR: So I'd say lambda has
to be much, much larger than 1.

01:12:45.670 --> 01:12:50.986
So once you're at lambda of
100, it looks like a Gaussian.

01:12:50.986 --> 01:12:53.110
And in Sunney's paper, he
had a comment about this.

01:12:53.110 --> 01:12:54.526
Does anybody
remember what it was?

01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:01.290
Was mRNA production
really well described

01:13:01.290 --> 01:13:06.395
as-- they mention
that actually there

01:13:06.395 --> 01:13:12.105
is some violation of
this model in the data.

01:13:12.105 --> 01:13:14.079
AUDIENCE: Does it
go into eukaryotes?

01:13:14.079 --> 01:13:16.120
PROFESSOR: Oh, as soon as
you go into eukaryotes,

01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:18.160
this is why I stay
away from them.

01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:21.350
But even in their
data, in E. coli,

01:13:21.350 --> 01:13:23.080
they actually
observed a deviation.

01:13:29.955 --> 01:13:32.500
So what they found is that there
was a cell cycle dependence

01:13:32.500 --> 01:13:36.810
to this bursting rate,
i.e. the mRNA production

01:13:36.810 --> 01:13:39.510
over the course
of the cell cycle.

01:13:39.510 --> 01:13:41.450
And presumably their
conclusion of this

01:13:41.450 --> 01:13:43.740
was that you have this guy.

01:13:43.740 --> 01:13:47.160
And then he turns
into, gets longer.

01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:50.817
And then eventually he septates,
and then you get two cells.

01:13:55.540 --> 01:13:59.940
What he found is that these
longer cells had actually

01:13:59.940 --> 01:14:03.210
a larger rate of mRNA synthesis
than the smaller cells.

01:14:03.210 --> 01:14:04.460
And actually this makes sense.

01:14:04.460 --> 01:14:07.590
Because here you maybe have
just one copy of the genome.

01:14:07.590 --> 01:14:12.930
Whereas here you might have--
you're making a second copy.

01:14:12.930 --> 01:14:16.180
So you might have two
copies of that gene.

01:14:16.180 --> 01:14:21.117
So it may make sense that this
bursting rate should grow.

01:14:21.117 --> 01:14:22.700
But does that mean
that you should not

01:14:22.700 --> 01:14:26.130
expect it to be a Poisson
distribution for the number

01:14:26.130 --> 01:14:27.642
of bursts per cell cycle?

01:14:33.540 --> 01:14:34.040
No.

01:14:34.040 --> 01:14:37.420
It actually is still-- it still
is described by a Poisson.

01:14:37.420 --> 01:14:40.650
Because you can just say,
this is the cell cycle.

01:14:40.650 --> 01:14:43.480
And here this is
Poisson of sum lambda 1.

01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:45.270
Here is a Poisson
of sum lambda 2.

01:14:45.270 --> 01:14:46.970
So there could be
a different rate

01:14:46.970 --> 01:14:47.700
over the course of the thing.

01:14:47.700 --> 01:14:49.241
But you still have
just two Poissons.

01:14:49.241 --> 01:14:51.230
You still get another Poisson.

01:14:51.230 --> 01:14:54.215
So adding Poissons,
gives you backup Poisson.

01:14:54.215 --> 01:14:56.090
They don't have to have
the same mean lambda.

01:15:04.230 --> 01:15:07.550
I just want to make
one comment about what

01:15:07.550 --> 01:15:09.940
you have to do once you start
thinking about eukaryotes.

01:15:09.940 --> 01:15:15.540
And the basic-- so you can
see the gamma distribution

01:15:15.540 --> 01:15:19.877
can either be peaked at 0, or it
can be peaked at nonzero value.

01:15:19.877 --> 01:15:21.710
So most, for like highly
expressed proteins,

01:15:21.710 --> 01:15:24.880
you'll see that it looks
something like this.

01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:27.620
Now for eukaryotes,
you also have

01:15:27.620 --> 01:15:30.490
to consider there's
some rate that you

01:15:30.490 --> 01:15:33.500
go between an active
and inactive promoter.

01:15:37.790 --> 01:15:40.470
And this actually makes
things much more complicated.

01:15:40.470 --> 01:15:43.220
So there's a rate
going to inactive,

01:15:43.220 --> 01:15:45.990
a rate going to active.

01:15:45.990 --> 01:15:48.390
And so now if you
look at, for example,

01:15:48.390 --> 01:15:50.980
the mRNA number per
cell, you'll see

01:15:50.980 --> 01:15:53.950
that it is no longer a Poisson.

01:15:53.950 --> 01:15:57.230
And I encourage you, if you're
curious about such things,

01:15:57.230 --> 01:16:00.340
to come up and look at this.

01:16:00.340 --> 01:16:02.320
The solution for the
steady state distribution

01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:03.528
has been solved analytically.

01:16:03.528 --> 01:16:06.630
For example, Arjun Raj, who
is the author of the review

01:16:06.630 --> 01:16:11.100
that you guys just read,
derived this equation here,

01:16:11.100 --> 01:16:12.756
which I don't know
if you can see.

01:16:12.756 --> 01:16:14.130
But even from a
distance, you can

01:16:14.130 --> 01:16:15.734
see that this is the solution.

01:16:15.734 --> 01:16:17.525
And this is just for
the mRNA distribution.

01:16:17.525 --> 01:16:20.640
This is not even getting to
the level of the protein.

01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:24.620
And it involves many gamma
functions, as well as

01:16:24.620 --> 01:16:29.210
a confluent hypergeometric
function of the first kind,

01:16:29.210 --> 01:16:31.400
which is a disaster.

01:16:31.400 --> 01:16:33.230
But he went to Courant.

01:16:33.230 --> 01:16:34.570
He was an applied mathematician.

01:16:34.570 --> 01:16:36.180
So this is, I
guess, this is what

01:16:36.180 --> 01:16:40.030
you can do after doing a
PhD in applied mathematics.

01:16:40.030 --> 01:16:43.020
The point though is that it
ends up being very complicated.

01:16:43.020 --> 01:16:47.490
And you can get hugely varying
distributions for the mRNA.

01:16:47.490 --> 01:16:50.240
And indeed this is seen
in individual cells.

01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:53.170
If you look at mammalian
cells, just at the mRNA level,

01:16:53.170 --> 01:16:56.260
you can have some cells that
have hardly any mRNA, some

01:16:56.260 --> 01:16:57.920
that have a huge number.

01:16:57.920 --> 01:16:59.720
The protein
distributions actually

01:16:59.720 --> 01:17:03.890
end up being more regular
than the mRNA distributions.

01:17:03.890 --> 01:17:07.290
Because of this
difference in lifetime.

01:17:07.290 --> 01:17:09.800
So the mRNA numbers
may fluctuate wildly.

01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:12.480
But the protein numbers
will fluctuate less,

01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:14.720
because they last longer.

01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:17.360
So then you do some averaging
over this crazy mRNA business.

01:17:23.940 --> 01:17:25.680
Now in the last--
yeah, go ahead.

01:17:25.680 --> 01:17:27.862
AUDIENCE: In terms of
timescale, like all

01:17:27.862 --> 01:17:31.500
this is switching to the
active and inactive promoter,

01:17:31.500 --> 01:17:32.480
like to the other--

01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:33.390
PROFESSOR: Ah, yes.

01:17:33.390 --> 01:17:36.490
That's a good question.

01:17:36.490 --> 01:17:39.470
I think that people argue
very much about this.

01:17:39.470 --> 01:17:41.630
This is kind of minutes.

01:17:41.630 --> 01:17:44.150
This can be hours.

01:17:44.150 --> 01:17:48.370
And this is maybe in
between those timescales

01:17:48.370 --> 01:17:51.020
would be typical.

01:17:51.020 --> 01:17:53.540
And when I say hours, especially
like in mammalian cells,

01:17:53.540 --> 01:17:55.630
they might only divide
once a day or so.

01:17:55.630 --> 01:17:59.460
So then this gets
to be many hours.

01:17:59.460 --> 01:18:03.935
And then I'd say
minutes is kind of the--

01:18:10.110 --> 01:18:13.190
So there were many
biological examples that

01:18:13.190 --> 01:18:14.690
were discussed in that review.

01:18:14.690 --> 01:18:16.560
And I'm not going to
talk about all them.

01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:18.070
But I think that
it's a nice review.

01:18:18.070 --> 01:18:20.492
Because it goes over some of
the papers that you've read,

01:18:20.492 --> 01:18:22.950
or that we've talked about over
the course of the semester.

01:18:22.950 --> 01:18:26.050
It also illustrates some
different biological context

01:18:26.050 --> 01:18:28.460
in which noise may play a role.

01:18:28.460 --> 01:18:30.220
But I want to mention
one study that

01:18:30.220 --> 01:18:33.450
was done by actually
again, Arjun together

01:18:33.450 --> 01:18:37.460
with Hedia Maamar, in
collaboration with Dave Dubnau,

01:18:37.460 --> 01:18:40.130
where they were studying
this process of competence.

01:18:40.130 --> 01:18:43.060
So in B. subtilis, during
sometimes particularly

01:18:43.060 --> 01:18:45.580
of starvation, or other
forms of unhappiness,

01:18:45.580 --> 01:18:49.190
they kind of pick
up DNA from outside.

01:18:49.190 --> 01:18:51.170
So they'll import DNA.

01:18:51.170 --> 01:18:52.740
Some of it may just be consumed.

01:18:52.740 --> 01:18:56.940
But some of it could actually
be incorporated into the genome.

01:18:56.940 --> 01:19:01.130
Now what they found is that
this competence process is

01:19:01.130 --> 01:19:02.830
mediated by this protein comK.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.450
And there was a
positive feedback loop,

01:19:10.450 --> 01:19:14.780
where this guy ends up
positively activating itself.

01:19:14.780 --> 01:19:19.270
And this helps lead to
bistability in this network.

01:19:19.270 --> 01:19:21.270
Only a small
fraction of the cells

01:19:21.270 --> 01:19:23.760
kind of get into this
high feedback state.

01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:26.660
Only a small fraction of them
activate competence and then

01:19:26.660 --> 01:19:28.260
uptake DNA.

01:19:28.260 --> 01:19:30.150
And what they were able
to show in that study

01:19:30.150 --> 01:19:33.270
was that it was sort
of noise-induced.

01:19:33.270 --> 01:19:36.760
That they were able to
vary both the transcription

01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:39.120
rate and the translation
rate, in a way

01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:41.840
so as to reduce the noise.

01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:43.580
The mean is the same.

01:19:43.580 --> 01:19:49.650
So if you in the context of
this model, what they did

01:19:49.650 --> 01:19:52.640
is they varied
transcription rate,

01:19:52.640 --> 01:19:55.640
and they varied
translation rate,

01:19:55.640 --> 01:19:58.180
each say, by a factor of 2.

01:19:58.180 --> 01:20:02.550
So they got the same mean,
but then different noise.

01:20:02.550 --> 01:20:03.630
And we're out of time.

01:20:03.630 --> 01:20:05.340
I would have you vote.

01:20:05.340 --> 01:20:06.800
But can anybody remember?

01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:10.010
If you want to
decrease the noise

01:20:10.010 --> 01:20:12.310
in the number of the
proteins, which of these

01:20:12.310 --> 01:20:15.717
do you want to go up, and
which do you want to go down?

01:20:15.717 --> 01:20:16.800
And which one is going up?

01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:18.599
Which one's going up let's say?

01:20:18.599 --> 01:20:19.140
AUDIENCE: Sm.

01:20:19.140 --> 01:20:20.270
PROFESSOR: Sm.

01:20:20.270 --> 01:20:23.154
Right, so if you want
to reduce the noise,

01:20:23.154 --> 01:20:24.820
but keep the mean
constant, you increase

01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:27.120
the rate of transcription,
and you decrease

01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:28.120
the rate of translation.

01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:30.460
Because the noise is really
driven by this protein

01:20:30.460 --> 01:20:33.250
bursting behavior here.

01:20:33.250 --> 01:20:34.910
And that's precisely
what they did.

01:20:34.910 --> 01:20:36.630
They changed those
two quantities.

01:20:36.630 --> 01:20:38.480
They got the same
mean, lower noise,

01:20:38.480 --> 01:20:41.860
and then they reduced the amount
of competence in that sur--
