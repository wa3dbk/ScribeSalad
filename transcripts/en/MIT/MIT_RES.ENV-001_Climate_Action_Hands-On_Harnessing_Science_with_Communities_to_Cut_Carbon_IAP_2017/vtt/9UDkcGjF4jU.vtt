00:00:25.878 --> 00:00:29.320
PROFESSOR: I'll do
the Vanna White thing.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.340
So this sucks in air
here, and inside,

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.040
57% of methane or other
combustible gases in it.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.330
And it sucks in about I
think half liter a minute.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.900
And so you can get a
percent gas in the air.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.200
And so luckily, at the moment,
there's probably 0% methane.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.410
AUDIENCE: Is that what
gas companies quickly

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:54.160
use to find leaks?

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.660
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
yeah, they normally

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:56.750
have a big probe on it.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.005
And what they do is they
take bang bar, which

00:01:00.005 --> 00:01:02.130
is like a big stick and
they stick it in the ground

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.060
until they get a
hole, and then they

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.250
stick this with a probe
on it, suck air in

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.100
and figure out what the
percent gas is in the soil.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.120
Then they know by where
the highest percentage

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.175
is in the soil.

00:01:13.175 --> 00:01:15.300
They figure, OK, that's
probably where the leak is,

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.180
and they start digging there.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:25.068
So it's a really simple
and fantastic tool.

00:01:25.068 --> 00:01:27.550
CGI, yeah, combustible
gas indicator.

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.850
PROFESSOR: And right here
is where the inlet is,

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.350
OK, just off of here.

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.000
We do this-- it's better to
do it than in the back bumper,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.010
because there can be some
exhaust contamination.

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:49.740
Actually, well, two cars, we've
tested it, do not interfere,

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.720
but this is a little
bit of an old van.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.520
So sometimes-- I mean, it
passed the emissions test,

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.370
but still there can
be some contamination.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.030
That's why when we
stopped, sometimes you'll

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.600
get some measurements, but
when you're moving forward

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.710
and the wind is upstream, you
know you're getting readings.

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:14.440
This is the methane
reading that analyzers

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.720
are reading right now.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.310
So it's anything below
2, it's right now,

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.690
1.96 is pretty clean.

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.660
There's no leak where
we are right now.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:31.510
So if it's under 2, you know
we're in a place with no leak.

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.720
And even if it creeps up over
2, if it's like 2.01, 2.02,

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.330
that's not really
indicative of a leak.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.020
But if you see it
go up to like 2,

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.005
your eyes can tell you
in time that oh, it

00:02:47.005 --> 00:02:50.050
seems to be going up
pretty rapidly here.

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.765
And so you'll see it maybe
go for 2.3 sometimes,

00:02:52.765 --> 00:02:54.460
and then drop back down.

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.380
And that's kind of unusual.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.002
That's like, OK, there's
probably something around here.

00:02:59.002 --> 00:03:00.460
And then every once
in a while, you

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:04.780
might see something that goes
up further, 3, 3 and 1/2,

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.710
and those are like
definite leaks.

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.490
AUDIENCE: What's the highest
number you've ever seen?

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.560
PROFESSOR: Well, in
DC, we got I think very

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.350
near to 100 parts per million.

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.450
And that's in the air
that we're breathing,

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.040
so it's not explosive
at that level.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.260
But it's like 50 times more
than the background value.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.300
AUDIENCE: So 2 is baseline
kind of background.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.008
PROFESSOR: Yeah, yeah,
you can consider 2

00:03:30.008 --> 00:03:32.260
to be a baseline level.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:41.980
Now it's like CO2, well, it used
to be 280 parts per million,

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.320
and now it's like over 400.

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.710
So 2 parts per million
methane is the new normal.

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:52.450
I mean it was 0.7 parts
per million, preindustrial.

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.090
So I would like
to point that out

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.180
that are our normal
baseline is very abnormal.

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.680
So we're going up
about that with leaks.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.270
Now this is a timeline
here, this graph,

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:08.590
and you can see as I came
in here, we did get 6, 7,

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.540
we got a few leaks here.

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.820
And that was right at the
Allston/Brighton tolls

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.610
coming down off
of the Mass Pike.

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:18.820
There's a leak there.

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.000
AUDIENCE: So what happens
in terms the reporting

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.650
that or following up with it?

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.200
PROFESSOR: So we don't
have any evidence,

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.270
but based on driving by.

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:33.550
We can't say whether it's
a green one hazardous leak,

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:38.530
a grade two, or a grade three
so-called non-hazardous leak.

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.040
So I don't feel
obligated that each

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.590
what we see that OK, we got
to call the gas company.

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:48.160
First of all, they do
know about these leaks.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:53.900
They know-- to a large
degree where they are.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.680
But if we get out, and we
could, because we have the CGI.

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.770
If we decide to get out and
poke around and look through it,

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.520
and we find evidence that
it is like a grade one,

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.896
then that's when I feel
obligated to call the leak in.

00:05:07.896 --> 00:05:09.670
'Cause it's like
we have knowledge

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:14.070
that something
seems to be unsafe,

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:15.733
and so then we call it in.

00:05:15.733 --> 00:05:16.233
Yep?

00:05:16.233 --> 00:05:17.732
AUDIENCE: Is there
a clear indicator

00:05:17.732 --> 00:05:19.180
when it's a grade one?

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:20.740
PROFESSOR: This
machine is not going

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.860
to be able to tell us whether
there's a grade one, a grade

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.230
explosive hazard, grade
two, or grade three.

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:34.510
And that's because you can
have big leaks with lots of gas

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:38.320
coming out that are
not explosive hazards.

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.480
Like the Porter
Ranch gas leak in LA,

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:44.800
Audrey makes this point
a lot, it was technically

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.090
a grade three
non-hazardous leak,

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:49.970
'cause it wasn't
going to explode.

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:52.180
And it wasn't that close
to the neighborhood,

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.610
it was like a quarter mile
away from the neighborhood.

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:57.700
So it's an indication
that that grading scheme

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.430
is only a single
variable grading scheme.

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:04.315
And explosion and
hazard is a big deal.

00:06:04.315 --> 00:06:06.440
There's no doubt about
that, and no one wants that.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:12.070
So what the grading
scheme has to incorporate

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:13.510
the amount of the flux.

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:15.910
There is a GPS on
this roof right now,

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:18.185
and it's plugged into
the back of the machine,

00:06:18.185 --> 00:06:22.375
and the data file that comes out
is already integrated with GPS

00:06:22.375 --> 00:06:23.765
with the time stamp.

00:06:23.765 --> 00:06:25.040
Straight?

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:27.554
AUDIENCE: Left, if we can, yep.

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:34.250
So what are the
objectives for today?

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:40.680
Is it just to see how
methane is measured,

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:44.600
or are we trying to answer
any particular questions?

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:48.140
PROFESSOR: So what we call
this is a gas leak safari.

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:50.480
So one of the objectives--

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:55.590
OK, here we are, 2, 3, 2, 3,
so there's something there.

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:02.090
So just to educate
and to show first

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:06.560
of all what this process is
of mapping the gas leaks.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:10.160
I think that we're going to
places that we have surveyed

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:15.530
in the past, Audrey and Heat did
the study now, two years ago,

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:17.810
is it?

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:19.334
But things change.

00:07:19.334 --> 00:07:20.500
AUDIENCE: Take a right here.

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:22.430
PROFESSOR: Right on Portland.

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:26.634
2.1, 2.1, OK, here we
have something, 2.1.

00:07:26.634 --> 00:07:28.050
So there's something
here I think.

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:28.633
AUDIENCE: 2.3.

00:07:28.633 --> 00:07:29.270
AUDIENCE: 2.5.

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:29.862
2.7.

00:07:29.862 --> 00:07:31.320
PROFESSOR: OK,
yeah, read them out.

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:32.980
AUDIENCE: 2.8.

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:39.082
PROFESSOR: OK, so there's a
leak here in this facility.

00:07:39.082 --> 00:07:41.537
AUDIENCE: Portland and Main.

00:07:41.537 --> 00:07:43.010
AUDIENCE: So that's at 2.3.

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:47.066
Oh, 3.3, well, 4.4, 4.4.

00:07:47.066 --> 00:07:48.064
AUDIENCE: 4.2.

00:07:48.064 --> 00:07:49.635
3.8.

00:07:49.635 --> 00:07:51.010
PROFESSOR: So you
can see there's

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:53.210
the spike on the leading edge.

00:07:57.210 --> 00:07:57.710
Right?

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:06.530
It's really as you can imagine,
as any lay person can imagine,

00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:09.610
the vagaries of wind
are going to the plume.

00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:12.500
The plume is coming out of
wherever it can come out.

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:14.780
I could come out of
a man hole slot--

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:15.454
straight on?

00:08:15.454 --> 00:08:16.370
AUDIENCE: Straight on.

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:19.220
PROFESSOR: It could
come out of the soil.

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:21.990
A leak is going to to just
find whatever parallel

00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:24.590
pathways it can get out.

00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:26.750
And so you can
imagine, at the surface

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:31.760
there's some kind of profile
of this stuff coming out.

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:35.059
And then the wind's going to
carry it and blow it around.

00:08:35.059 --> 00:08:40.309
And so that makes
it a little tough.

00:08:40.309 --> 00:08:43.490
We can't really
pinpoint exactly where

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:45.220
it's coming out of the ground.

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:48.000
We can know when we
have driven by it.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.150
There's a leak in this
vicinity, and I would always

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:54.140
say within 50 to
100 feet of where

00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:57.660
we measured it is probably
part of the source coming

00:08:57.660 --> 00:08:59.030
on the ground.

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:03.480
But to actually really pinpoint
where the pipeline leak is

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.480
would require stopping, getting
out, and using the instrument

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:10.290
that Audrey has as well as
maybe some other instruments,

00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:15.950
handheld snippers to really
find out where it's coming out.

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:21.140
What you're realizing right
now that makes it like discreet

00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:26.030
when we see a leak, if you
look at this timeline here,

00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:29.870
this trace, you can see
there's a lot of flat

00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:33.680
and then some fairly
well resolved spikes.

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:38.450
And so it's not very
ambiguous when you get

00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:40.820
an elevated anomalous reading.

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:43.940
It's like, oh, there's one,
there's one, there's one.

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:46.450
Here's a couple that are
small, but they really

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:50.190
need to go very clearly
from the back ground.

00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:53.300
So there's not that much
ambiguity about like, well,

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:57.525
is this kind of giant
blob a leak or not?

00:09:57.525 --> 00:10:02.205
They're well resolved
spikes in time and space.

00:10:02.205 --> 00:10:03.580
AUDIENCE: What's
the biggest leak

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:06.205
you've seen in the Boston area?

00:10:06.205 --> 00:10:09.550
PROFESSOR: Maybe like 40 or 50
parts per million in the air.

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:11.811
AUDIENCE: Where was that?

00:10:11.811 --> 00:10:14.310
PROFESSOR: Well, a couple of
places that were close to that.

00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:21.700
One was Sullivan Square,
Rutherford Street

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:24.760
in Charles Town, kind of on
the Somerville Charles Town

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:26.480
border, the giant rotary.

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:27.210
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:28.960
PROFESSOR: I mean, we
could go over there,

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:30.250
there is a big leak there.

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:33.313
And then Nonantum Road between
kind of Watertown and Newton.

00:10:33.313 --> 00:10:37.248
2.2, 2.3, OK, so there's
something here, OK.

00:10:37.248 --> 00:10:39.470
2.3, OK, so we've got, 2.5.

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:40.782
AUDIENCE: 2.5.

00:10:40.782 --> 00:10:41.674
AUDIENCE: 2.8.

00:10:41.674 --> 00:10:42.803
3.

00:10:42.803 --> 00:10:43.610
3.2.

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:45.482
4.8.

00:10:45.482 --> 00:10:46.450
AUDIENCE: 6.

00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:47.980
AUDIENCE: Oh boy.

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:48.817
Oh boy.

00:10:48.817 --> 00:10:49.400
AUDIENCE: 5.3.

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:52.220
PROFESSOR: So I mean, we
could get out and take a break

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:54.230
and find it if you
wanted on this one.

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:55.520
It's kind of quiet.

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:58.340
This is definitely a
much blunter instrument

00:10:58.340 --> 00:10:59.690
than that one.

00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:05.640
And it's made to find out
like percent level, 50%, 10%,

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:07.146
not parts per million.

00:11:07.146 --> 00:11:09.790
OK, so this is now when
you want to find out

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:14.198
where is it coming out at, OK?

00:11:14.198 --> 00:11:18.272
The professionals right
now would have this bar,

00:11:18.272 --> 00:11:19.230
it's called a bang bar.

00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:22.140
It's like one of those
construction pile drivers,

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:24.160
it's like a handheld
version of that.

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:28.000
And you would find out,
maybe right here, you'd

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.800
like slam it down
maybe up to a meter.

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:34.280
And this would have
a longer thing,

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:35.446
and you'd stick it in there.

00:11:35.446 --> 00:11:40.510
Now I don't do that, because
I'm not certified to do that,

00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:42.820
and I don't want to
puncture any gas lines

00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:44.590
and create an explosion.

00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:49.720
So what I do is I just
kind of do like this,

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:53.220
and sometimes I'll use like
a screwdriver or just a stick

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:56.440
even, and kind of--

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:58.870
this is right at the surface--

00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:00.550
and poke around.

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:04.740
So actually look, there
is something, point 0.2.

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:08.260
Now the fact, 0.25%.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:16.250
So 0.25% is, let's see, 1%
is 10,000 parts per million,

00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:19.020
right, 1% is 10, 000
parts per million.

00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:22.680
This is 8,500 parts
per million right now--

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:24.960
0.85, 0.9.

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:29.040
OK, so the thing is that
this is right at the surface.

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:32.340
If I was down even
probably that much,

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:35.590
it would probably be
I don't know 15%, 20%.

00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:38.940
And if we went down a little
further, this could be 90% gas.

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:44.750
See this is 0.25.

00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:46.370
Yeah, so about the same.

00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:50.300
I'm just like about that far in.

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:54.430
So this is an indication that
there's definitely a leak here.

00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:57.140
And it's no mistake we got
the 15 parts per million

00:12:57.140 --> 00:13:00.260
in the kind of air
that we're breathing.

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:03.020
So now let's look around
for just infrastructure.

00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:07.160
Let's see I mean, that was
a very arbitrary choice

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:07.970
of a place to look.

00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:10.940
It's just we got
out, we're here.

00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:13.500
But now I want to see like,
OK, where is the gas line?

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:15.800
AUDIENCE: And all that.

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:20.110
PROFESSOR: That could be a
vestige of a gas leak marking.

00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:23.240
And this big patch has
been for some purpose,

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:24.950
I don't know if
it was a gas line.

00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:26.930
I see some more
yellow paint out here.

00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:32.902
OK, so this is --

00:13:32.902 --> 00:13:37.040
OK, yeah, always be very
careful with the cars of course.

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:42.920
So this is a service line
coming off of the main, OK?

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:47.960
So service lines going this way,
mains generally going that way.

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:50.480
Mains can be at
an angle, they can

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:55.406
be running under the sidewalk,
so anything can really happen.

00:13:55.406 --> 00:13:56.780
AUDIENCE: So were
mains laid down

00:13:56.780 --> 00:13:59.930
before the streets were
gridded or something or what?

00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:01.809
PROFESSOR: Or
sometimes afterwards.

00:14:01.809 --> 00:14:03.350
AUDIENCE: OK, but
if it's afterwards,

00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:05.070
I'm going to assume that there--
configures to the street.

00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:07.670
PROFESSOR: They probably
would do it running that way

00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:08.810
if it was done afterwards.

00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:09.757
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:14:09.757 --> 00:14:11.465
PROFESSOR: This is an
electrical manhole.

00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:18.100
The gas can come in any--

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:19.700
it can seep in anywhere.

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:23.330
So 0.25, OK, so gas in there.

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:27.470
All right, so we did this.

00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:37.150
OK so, all right, so there's
definitely gas in here.

00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:39.380
That's very, very clear.

00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:40.970
I mean, if you
really wanted to, you

00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:42.770
could smell, and smell
the gas, but I'm not

00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:45.410
going to recommend that.

00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:47.830
But this is not an
explosive thresh hold.

00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:51.620
So I don't feel like, back
off, don't smoke or whatever.

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:57.450
Well, don't smoke,
but if it were 4%,

00:14:57.450 --> 00:15:01.030
then that would be a grade
one explosive hazard, OK?

00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:03.460
And we would call
it in, and they

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:06.750
would come out immediately,
well, within a half hour or so.

00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:10.000
AUDIENCE: And again, 4%
is what on that readout?

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.380
PROFESSOR: 40,000
parts per million.

00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:15.500
4% is equal to 40,000
parts per million.

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:19.270
So if the 4.0, that's
40,000 parts per million.

00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:21.760
And that's the lower
explosion threshold,

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:25.160
the higher explosion
threshold is about 15% gas.

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:28.420
If it gets above that,
there's not enough oxygen

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:29.769
for it to explode.

00:15:29.769 --> 00:15:31.560
PROFESSOR: All right,
where little kids are

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:33.685
like playing in the
playground, there's a grade one

00:15:33.685 --> 00:15:36.540
leak under a manhole,
we call it in,

00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:39.270
and these two guys
from Evershore

00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:43.600
arrive, and they don't
even have like a bang bar,

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:47.358
and they didn't have the right
instrumentation to do anything.

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:52.200
So we pop open the
manhole for them.

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:54.855
And they look and
they're like, yeah.

00:15:54.855 --> 00:15:56.730
Then we go off to the
side, and they actually

00:15:56.730 --> 00:15:58.680
said in front of
me, because I don't

00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:02.070
think they realized that
I wasn't a utility person,

00:16:02.070 --> 00:16:05.460
they're like, yeah, you
just got to think sometimes,

00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:08.617
an explosion is the
price of using gas.

00:16:08.617 --> 00:16:13.534
And like the kids are behind
us playing in the playground.

00:16:13.534 --> 00:16:16.510
AUDIENCE: It wasn't a
facetious comment, huh?

00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:18.899
PROFESSOR: No, it was an--

00:16:18.899 --> 00:16:20.690
AUDIENCE: Like it comes
with the territory?

00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:23.630
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
and I mean, yeah, it

00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:25.950
was sort of, in
front of the kids,

00:16:25.950 --> 00:16:28.192
I just thought that
was really strange.

00:16:28.192 --> 00:16:33.012
AUDIENCE: So did they do
something [INAUDIBLE]??

00:16:33.012 --> 00:16:36.104
PROFESSOR: They did fix it
after a while, what Bob said,

00:16:36.104 --> 00:16:38.594
but they didn't fix
it at that point.

00:16:38.594 --> 00:16:40.260
AUDIENCE: That's the
highest we've seen.

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:44.790
PROFESSOR: Yeah, 1, 1, 1,
it just exceeded 1, 1.2.

00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:47.686
So the gas company, so 2.2.

00:16:47.686 --> 00:16:52.650
OK, so this is too close to this
tree to be good for this tree.

00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:57.810
And clearly this
tree is not that old.

00:16:57.810 --> 00:16:59.640
How long ago did they
put this in here,

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:01.350
how much did it cost
to put this in here?

00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:03.600
And now you've got a leak here.

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:08.220
And this white paint, that's a
sign of the gas company having

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:12.250
been out here at some
point to monitor.

00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:14.880
Here's the service line.

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:17.432
So I don't know, I mean--

00:17:17.432 --> 00:17:19.140
AUDIENCE: Sorry if I
missed this earlier,

00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:20.849
but why does methane
kill the tree?

00:17:20.849 --> 00:17:22.410
PROFESSOR: Oh, yeah, sorry.

00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:25.800
The methane, the natural
gas has no oxygen in it.

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:28.890
And the root systems need
oxygen to metabolize,

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:33.300
so you've got this plume
of anoxic soil volume,

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:35.015
and it kills the roots.

00:17:35.015 --> 00:17:36.390
AUDIENCE: So in
fact, right here,

00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:39.000
isn't it the case that there
could have been an older tree

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.950
the same age as
these tall ones that

00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:43.140
died and was replaced by this.

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:47.190
And possibly it died
because of methane leak.

00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:49.401
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
I mean, it would

00:17:49.401 --> 00:17:51.900
be very interesting to find out
what the history of this is,

00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:53.316
because this is I
don't know, this

00:17:53.316 --> 00:17:55.680
is maybe two to
three years old is

00:17:55.680 --> 00:18:01.090
my guess from the sampling
from whatever it was planted.

00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:04.920
So OK, I'm not getting anything
at the very surface here,

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:09.140
but we definitely
got some there.

00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:11.850
And that's two too close to
this tree, because I mean,

00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:15.160
the root system is
certainly going over there.

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:17.160
Another really interesting
thing, so it actually

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:18.480
does come back to being--

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:22.651
so I'm a tree
physiologist actually.

00:18:22.651 --> 00:18:24.150
That's what I'm
suppose to be doing,

00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:25.524
that's why I got
into this stuff.

00:18:25.524 --> 00:18:28.620
But it's interesting,
because some trees have

00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:32.040
a vasculature that
is called segmented,

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:36.840
and some tree species have an
integrated vascular structure.

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:41.310
What that means is that some
species, the roots on this side

00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:44.670
are connected to the pipes
that run water on this side

00:18:44.670 --> 00:18:47.710
and are connected to the
branches on the side.

00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:52.000
And then this side operates
kind of like as a parallel path.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.450
Whereas other trees
species like pine,

00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:59.330
a lot of the pine species, it's
like whatever comes out of here

00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:02.130
or goes through here could have
been from anywhere in the soil,

00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:05.290
it's integrated, OK,
spatially integrated.

00:19:05.290 --> 00:19:09.960
So if the gas leak has
some spatial pattern to it,

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:13.020
you could see differences in
where it shows up on the tree

00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:16.680
depending on the tree species
and its vascular structure.

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:18.470
Look at this, look
how it's breaking off,

00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:20.900
like the twigs
are just snapping.

00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:23.500
This tree is not in
good, it's dried out.

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:27.300
And so this is not, this
tree is having problems.

00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:29.370
You can just, I mean, I'm
not killing this tree,

00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:32.280
it's just like
these tips are dead.

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:35.390
They're not hydrated.

00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:37.800
AUDIENCE: Well, this one's OK.

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:38.300
OK,

00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:41.900
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so
these are OK over here.

00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:43.740
This side is not doing so good.

00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:44.480
So I don't know.

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:46.438
AUDIENCE: So it's something
that you envisioned

00:19:46.438 --> 00:19:52.652
citizen scientist doing
like measuring for methane

00:19:52.652 --> 00:19:55.510
and trace the problem
for their trees,

00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:58.210
and then reporting it to
the city or reporting it--

00:19:58.210 --> 00:20:00.370
PROFESSOR: Totally, yeah.

00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:04.040
And that's the whole idea behind
making this available through

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:07.000
heat by the Sierra Club, I'm
on the executive committee

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.020
of the Sierra Club, so I'm
like promoting the Sierra Club.

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:15.620
But they're making these things
available for communities

00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:17.990
to do what we're doing,
to use your nose,

00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:22.327
to use your eyes to find.

00:20:22.327 --> 00:20:24.410
People will walk by it's
like, oh, I smell a leak,

00:20:24.410 --> 00:20:27.080
and then you can go and
check this out and actually

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:30.230
find out where it is,
and then report it.

00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:33.320
You don't have to wait to
report it if you smell a leak,

00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:35.220
you can and should report it.

00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:37.940
But it empowers you
to find out more.

00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:44.630
And Mothers Out Front has been
amazing in terms of also--

00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:46.880
it's not just what
they know, but when

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:48.350
they plant that
flag in the ground,

00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:51.380
it's showing everyone else that
there's a leak here as well.

00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:54.140
So just essentially
making the problem

00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:57.304
transparent to everyone.

00:20:57.304 --> 00:20:58.280
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:02.030
PROFESSOR: So Mothers Out
Front has had and maybe

00:21:02.030 --> 00:21:05.055
still do a campaign
where there's a leak,

00:21:05.055 --> 00:21:06.725
they just plant a
yellow flag, and it

00:21:06.725 --> 00:21:09.800
has a sniffing nose on it and
it basically makes it clear

00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:11.090
that there's a leak there.

00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:14.150
AUDIENCE: We did in a
concentrated time period,

00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:17.820
and then we collected
the flags back again.

00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:22.490
But during that process, a
lot of people talked with us

00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:26.330
and were reading the
information that we left

00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:28.532
attached to the flag--

00:21:28.532 --> 00:21:29.990
AUDIENCE: Did the
utility companies

00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:32.420
respond to those
flags at all per se?

00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:35.810
AUDIENCE: Not in any
way that we know.

00:21:35.810 --> 00:21:37.830
Audrey might know
a little bit more.

00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:41.670
We didn't do any
measurements, we were just

00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:44.860
going from the mapping
that had been done,

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:50.046
and we were given points
where there was more

00:21:50.046 --> 00:21:52.602
significant leakage going on.

00:21:52.602 --> 00:21:54.060
PROFESSOR: And so
that was actually

00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:57.090
driven by information
provided by the utilities.

00:21:57.090 --> 00:22:01.761
But like a follow on
development of this could be--

00:22:01.761 --> 00:22:05.790
'cause we know that the leak map
provided by the utilities, as

00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:08.430
good as Audrey did to
put them faithfully

00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:10.200
down where they were looking.

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:12.510
The utilities get
it wrong sometimes,

00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:14.140
or these missing leaks--

00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:15.315
what are we calling them?

00:22:15.315 --> 00:22:16.565
AUDIENCE: Yeah, missing leaks.

00:22:16.565 --> 00:22:19.290
PROFESSOR: Missing leaks
that have come off the books.

00:22:19.290 --> 00:22:23.280
And it doesn't seem like
they like 15% of them

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:27.840
came off like on December
31st, it doesn't make sense.

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:31.000
So it's kind of
auditing them as well.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.654
And this is just us
being parked here, OK?

00:22:33.654 --> 00:22:35.820
So you can see it going up
and down and up and down,

00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:40.140
and that again, is just the
wind wafting this leak around.

00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:42.870
So it gives you an idea of
the vagaries of the weather

00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:43.660
conditions.

00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:48.180
But you can see also that even
when it goes down, I mean,

00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:50.910
the lowest it ever went
here is like, I don't know,

00:22:50.910 --> 00:22:53.340
2.7 or maybe 3 or so.

00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:56.160
So it's obviously a leak.

00:22:56.160 --> 00:23:00.130
But depending on the conditions,
I mean, we were up above 16, we

00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:02.460
we're down to like 3.

00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:04.840
And so if you drive a
leak two different times,

00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:07.336
you're going to get two
different peak readings.

00:23:07.336 --> 00:23:08.794
That's part of the
thing that makes

00:23:08.794 --> 00:23:14.510
it difficult to estimate like
really how big the leak is.

00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:17.430
This is still the
Swiss Alps of leaks.

00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:18.610
OK, here's the school.

00:23:22.602 --> 00:23:24.600
AUDIENCE: What are you at?

00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:27.233
PROFESSOR: 2.4, 3.3, OK, so
there's a leak right here

00:23:27.233 --> 00:23:29.510
at the school, 2.37.

00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:31.100
So when you see it
dip down like that

00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:33.308
and then come back up like
that, that's pretty clear.

00:23:33.308 --> 00:23:37.010
We're moving at a steady pace
here, so got a leak here.

00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:38.700
I didn't pay attention
to the trees.

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:39.600
AUDIENCE: 4.

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:41.350
PROFESSOR: 4, OK.

00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:45.920
Some young trees, patches.

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:50.260
AUDIENCE: 3.8, 3.4, 2.9.

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:52.325
PROFESSOR: OK, that
tree [INAUDIBLE]..

00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:57.670
All right, so leaks there.

00:23:57.670 --> 00:23:59.104
9.

00:23:59.104 --> 00:23:59.997
We got 9.

00:23:59.997 --> 00:24:00.538
AUDIENCE: 12.

00:24:00.538 --> 00:24:01.494
PROFESSOR: 11.

00:24:01.494 --> 00:24:03.265
AUDIENCE: 11.

00:24:03.265 --> 00:24:04.640
PROFESSOR: You
want to pull over?

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:05.265
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:24:05.265 --> 00:24:06.428
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:24:06.428 --> 00:24:08.660
AUDIENCE: And you see the
yellow markings everywhere,

00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:11.200
and that's always gas,
the yellow is gas.

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:15.370
PROFESSOR: Yeah, yellow
always refers to gas.

00:24:15.370 --> 00:24:18.280
Blue is water.

00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:21.900
PROFESSOR: So it's like you
see stuff every time that's

00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:22.900
just a little different.

00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:26.090
Like I don't know if I've
ever seen a marking like right

00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:30.560
on a curbstone like
that for [INAUDIBLE]..

00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:33.609
I guess that's the
arrow [INAUDIBLE]..

00:24:33.609 --> 00:24:35.650
PROFESSOR: Yeah, but there
seems to one here too,

00:24:35.650 --> 00:24:39.246
so are there two 12 inch
mains running down the street

00:24:39.246 --> 00:24:40.440
that way underneath us.

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:42.460
PROFESSOR: You have
multiple mains.

00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:45.380
Oh, I think of
bracketing it here.

00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:47.250
So you can see the
two yellow lines.

00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:50.360
But here it is,
12 inch cast iron.

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:52.800
Cast iron is the
old leaky stuff.

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:58.000
It's the most leak prone, most
prevalent leak prone pipe.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.714
PROFESSOR: So with
cast iron, they

00:24:59.714 --> 00:25:01.130
way they originally
did it is they

00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:04.550
put jute, which is sort of a
grass, between the two joint--

00:25:04.550 --> 00:25:05.840
to close the joints.

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:10.020
And then as gas got
less humid, because they

00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:14.410
decreased the humidity of
the gas, that jute dried out.

00:25:14.410 --> 00:25:18.160
And so they're basically
almost all cast iron

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:22.810
has problems, every 12
feet, because of that.

00:25:22.810 --> 00:25:23.914
AUDIENCE: Wow.

00:25:23.914 --> 00:25:26.736
PROFESSOR: Let's see if we
get anything out of here.

00:25:26.736 --> 00:25:29.157
PROFESSOR: Nathan and
Bob Ackley went out to--

00:25:29.157 --> 00:25:30.990
PROFESSOR: All that
work and we got nothing.

00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:35.410
So it's not [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:39.455 --> 00:25:44.534
Now these are drill holes,
so kind of push it there

00:25:44.534 --> 00:25:45.700
and see if you get anything.

00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:49.440
Just hold it down,
you'll hear it slow down,

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:54.240
the pump slow down if
you push it too hard.

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:55.440
OK, nothing there.

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:58.649
So drill holes are for the gas
company when they come out.

00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:15.300
OK, let's come out
quick and try these.

00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:18.630
All right, so let's go out
here and let's just test--

00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:22.460
let's stick it in one of
these things real quick.

00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:25.460
Leave it in for
about 10 seconds.

00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:28.740
And maybe someone can make
sure we don't get hit.

00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:30.730
Keep an eye out.

00:26:30.730 --> 00:26:33.350
AUDIENCE: OK, there we go.

00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:39.774
40.4.

00:26:39.774 --> 00:26:40.940
PROFESSOR: Keep it in there.

00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:43.644
Keep it in there.

00:26:43.644 --> 00:26:44.560
AUDIENCE: Cars coming.

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:46.060
PROFESSOR: All
right, we can get up.

00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:48.890
OK, so definitely gas in there.

00:26:48.890 --> 00:26:54.620
OK, so yeah, we
didn't really find--

00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:58.385
we found the leak, but we didn't
find any large concentration.

00:26:58.385 --> 00:27:00.260
AUDIENCE: It might have
been a little further

00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:02.090
down the block, the scent.

00:27:02.090 --> 00:27:05.090
PROFESSOR: I mean, it's all
along this block, so yeah.

00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:07.190
This is relatively new,
right, look at the line

00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:10.170
where the new paving was.

00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:13.140
This intersection was redone
with a new everything,

00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:13.830
we got gas.

00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:20.330
So this is an example
of a lost opportunity.

00:27:20.330 --> 00:27:24.610
PROFESSOR: With MAPC, he did
a study to sort of figure

00:27:24.610 --> 00:27:28.840
out how much municipalities
and gas companies could

00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:31.540
save by doing sort of more
integrated infrastructure

00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:33.170
repair and not
screwing up like this.

00:27:33.170 --> 00:27:34.640
AUDIENCE: Here comes a, yep.

00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:38.620
PROFESSOR: And it
was like $1 billion.

00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:42.910
You can check it out
and fixourpipes.org.

00:27:42.910 --> 00:27:45.480
It's a really beautiful website.

00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:48.930
PROFESSOR: So it was
just a little bit.

00:27:48.930 --> 00:27:54.729
But there is gas, I
mean, so that's not good.

00:27:54.729 --> 00:27:56.270
PROFESSOR: So you
can sort of imagine

00:27:56.270 --> 00:27:58.490
like all the infrastructure
underneath, both the gas

00:27:58.490 --> 00:28:00.830
pipes and the electric and
the water mains and stuff

00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:03.150
like that, as well
as the paving.

00:28:03.150 --> 00:28:05.930
And the paving alone
in Massachusetts

00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:10.280
I think is $600,000
on average per mile.

00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:13.720
So it's just expense layered
on expense on expense.

00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:17.160
And so if you fix anything,
if you cut into the pavement

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:20.864
for any reason, you should just
fix all of it at the same time.

00:28:20.864 --> 00:28:22.780
'Cause otherwise,
it's like operating

00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:25.330
on somebody's appendix and
finding a broken artery,

00:28:25.330 --> 00:28:27.900
and be like, oh, whatever.

00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:30.790
Forget that, we'll take care
of that some other time.

00:28:30.790 --> 00:28:32.640
Not our responsibility.
