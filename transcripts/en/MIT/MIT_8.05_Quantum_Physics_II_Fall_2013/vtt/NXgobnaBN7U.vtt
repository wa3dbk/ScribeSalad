BARTON ZWIEBACH: Let's begin.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.730
So today's lecture will
deal with the subject

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.620
of squeeze states
and photon states.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.240
And it all builds up from
the ideas of coherent states

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.130
that we were talking
about last time.

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:46.335
So let me begin by reminding
you about the few facts

00:00:46.335 --> 00:00:49.350
that we had about
coherent states.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.290
So a coherent state was
born by taking the ground

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.870
state of the harmonic
oscillator and displacing it

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.400
with a translation
operator some distance, x0.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.700
And then we let
it go, and we saw

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:09.270
that this sort of wave function
would just move from the left

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.480
and to the right coherently,
without spreading out,

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.180
without changing shape.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.740
It would move in a nice way.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:23.050
Now, this was obtained with
a translation operator, which

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.980
was an exponential that had
on the exponent the momentum

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.900
operator.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.780
But we realized eventually that
the reason it all works out

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.440
is because its exponential
of something that

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.600
depends on creation or
annihilation operators,

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.130
and we could do
something more general,

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.880
which was to use a
complex number, alpha,

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.430
and define a
displacement operator,

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:00.110
a more general one, that is
some linear combination of a

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.370
and a dagger with alpha and
the complex conjugate of alpha.

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:12.230
So this is only proportional to
the momentum if alpha is real,

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.900
but if alpha is not real,
that operator in the exponent

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.700
is not quite the momentum.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.090
It's something that has a
bit of position as well.

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.420
So this is a more
general operator,

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.690
but on the other
hand, it's clear

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.530
that it's anti-Hermitian,
because if you

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.590
take the dagger of this
thing, this term becomes

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.050
that and that term
becomes this one,

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.270
each one with a change of sign.

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.150
So you're really with an
anti-Hermitian operator.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.460
Therefore, the whole
operator is unitary

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.960
and you're acting with a
unitary operator on the vacuum.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.930
And therefore, this state
is also well normalized

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.570
and represents a state
with some expectation

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:01.980
value of the position.

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.850
Just like a coherent state,
we moved it to the right

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.100
and it had some expectation
value of the position.

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.720
But this one also has
some expectation value

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.450
of the momentum.

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:21.930
So in fact, we realize that the
real part of alpha in this axis

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.170
was related to the expectation
value of the position divided

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:27.580
by to the 0.

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.250
So if you produce
a coherent state

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:35.270
with this value of alpha
in the complex alpha plane,

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:38.030
well, you go down and
that's the expectation value

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.220
of the position.

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.420
You go horizontally,
well, that's

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.170
the expectation value
of the momentum scaled

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.110
because this alpha is a
pure number, has no units.

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:55.560
So this x over square root
of 2 d0 and p d0 over h

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:01.210
bar have no units, and
that's how it should be.

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:06.520
So we learned also that the
annihilation operator acting

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:10.560
on this coherent state was
alpha times the coherent state.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.030
So it's a very simple property.

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.160
That number, alpha,
is the eigenvalue

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.020
of the destruction operator.

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.550
Now, that's a one line
computation based on this,

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.820
or a two line computation maybe.

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.360
But it should be a computation
that is easy for you to do.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:40.100
So make sure you
know how to get this

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.750
very quickly from
this definition.

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.570
So that's a coherent state.

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:48.340
And then the thing we
finished the lecture

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:53.080
with was with the time evolution
of this coherent state.

00:04:53.080 --> 00:05:00.360
And the time evolution was that
as the state, alpha, in time

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:06.620
becomes the state alpha at time
t, it remains a coherent state

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.720
but the value of
alpha is changed.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.160
In fact, the value
of alpha is changed

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.890
in such a way that you can just
imagine this thing rotating,

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:20.370
and rotating with
angular velocity, omega.

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:25.870
So this thing was
the coherent state,

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:30.130
e to the minus i omega t alpha.

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:34.050
So this whole complex number,
instead of being alpha,

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:35.030
is just this.

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:37.650
There's no comma t.

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:39.880
This is the time
development of the state.

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:46.330
And there was a phase here, e
to the minus i omega t over 2,

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.540
that was not very relevant.

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:51.830
But that's what the
state was doing in time.

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:56.890
So basically, that's
where we got last time.

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:00.686
Before I push on, do
you have any questions?

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:11.760
I did post the notes associated
to coherent states about half

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:15.760
an hour ago, so you have them.

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:19.830
You do have two problems
on coherent states

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:24.300
in this homework, so the
notes should help you.

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:27.260
But any questions
about this picture?

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:35.690
OK.

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:38.710
So I want to develop
it a little more

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:45.730
before starting
with squeeze states.

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:49.810
So here's what I
want to tell you.

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:54.516
And this is an intuition that
people have about these states.

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.620
Alpha is a complex number.

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:02.970
And you know, it's a
well-defined complex number.

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:06.400
But you know, this
is a coherent state,

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:11.730
so it's not a
position eigenstate.

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:14.755
It's not a momentum eigenstate.

00:07:14.755 --> 00:07:17.130
It's not an energy eigenstate.

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:19.670
It has all kinds
of uncertainties.

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:24.000
It has uncertainties in
position, in momentum,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:24.890
and in energy.

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:26.226
Yes?

00:07:26.226 --> 00:07:30.242
AUDIENCE: On that complex plane
where you have the x and the p,

00:07:30.242 --> 00:07:33.865
are those expectation values
of the position of momentum?

00:07:33.865 --> 00:07:34.740
BARTON ZWIEBACH: Yes.

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:37.220
I think I wrote them
with expectation values

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:39.600
of the position of
momentum last time.

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:40.710
Yes.

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:43.400
So given alpha,
that number you get

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:46.740
is the expectation value
of position or expectation

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:48.336
value of momentum.

00:07:48.336 --> 00:07:48.835
Correct.

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:56.940
So actually, this is
the expectation value

00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:59.810
of the position,
but the position

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:03.726
is a little bit rounded.

00:08:03.726 --> 00:08:06.700
Yeah, this is the expectation
value of the position.

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:07.460
It's a number.

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:11.360
But intuitively, this
is spread out a little.

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:16.020
The position is
not just one point.

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:18.425
This is a coherent state.

00:08:18.425 --> 00:08:21.370
It looks like a
Gaussian wave function.

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:25.650
The momentum is also
spread out a little.

00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:29.900
So in some sense, many people
draw this as a little blob.

00:08:38.419 --> 00:08:43.039
And that blob represents
your intuition

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:46.275
that yes, the
expectation value is this

00:08:46.275 --> 00:08:48.210
and the expectation
value is this,

00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:53.680
but the position is, well,
somewhere around this thing

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:57.890
and somewhere around that stuff.

00:08:57.890 --> 00:09:02.810
You can complain, this is very
hand wavy, but it's useful.

00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:06.660
It's good to have that physical
picture that the state really

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:11.610
is some sort of blob here, not
that the expectation values are

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:16.950
not well defined, but rather
that it's something like this.

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:24.270
And I want to relate it to
an idea that comes along

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:27.890
with waves, and it's
important for what

00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:30.890
we're going to be
doing later today.

00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:41.920
If you have a wave with energy
e, and suppose your wave

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:45.740
is a light wave.

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:49.090
Light wave with energy e.

00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:53.660
And it's described by,
say, A cosine omega t.

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:56.450
That's some component
of the electric field

00:09:56.450 --> 00:10:00.910
or the magnetic
field for this wave.

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:01.970
It is like that.

00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:06.190
Well, we've been talking
about energy time uncertainty,

00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:11.580
and we know that unless we
make things very precise.

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:14.900
It's easy to get things wrong.

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:20.630
So I will first do
something fairly imprecise

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:24.550
to give you a feeling of
what people talk about,

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:27.925
and then we'll use this picture
to do it more precisely.

00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:39.620
So if you have
this wave, the face

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:44.526
of this wave-- we'll
call it phi-- is omega t.

00:10:44.526 --> 00:10:49.350
And if we are naive
there, the face

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:54.280
is divided by omega
is the error in time.

00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:05.650
Now, this wave has energy E.
It has some number of photons.

00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:12.245
So the energy, E, is the number
of photons times h bar omega.

00:11:12.245 --> 00:11:14.380
N is equal to number of photons.

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:29.430
And again, we could say delta
E is delta N h bar omega,

00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:36.270
and then substitute these
two relations into this

00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:37.590
to see what we get.

00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:47.540
Well, delta E is
delta N h bar omega.

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:51.970
Delta t is delta phi over omega.

00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:55.660
This should be h bar over 2.

00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:59.180
The omegas cancel,
the h bar cancels,

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:10.860
and you get delta N delta phi
is about 1, or 1 over 2 or 1

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:12.170
over square root of 2.

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:17.000
And that's, in
fact, the relation

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.340
that people do take
somewhat seriously,

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:24.820
if you have a wave
in quantum optics

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:27.380
and say, well, the uncertainty
in the number of photons

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:31.590
and the uncertainty in the
coherence of these photons,

00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:36.610
the phases, if they're out of
phase, they're not coherent,

00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:38.360
there's a relation of this kind.

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:46.410
And this derivation is
certainly pretty bad.

00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:51.470
It's just not
precise because even

00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:55.210
we started with this that is
not precise unless you really

00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:58.590
explain what you
mean by delta t.

00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:02.605
So let's see if we can make
some sense of this picture here.

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:06.880
So here we go.

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:10.345
I want to do a small
calculation first.

00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:19.000
So let's see what we have.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.600
In this coherent state, what
is the expectation value

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:26.860
of the number operator?

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:31.720
Expectation value of the
number operator in alpha.

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:34.210
Well, the number
operator in alpha,

00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:40.000
you would do this a
dagger a in alpha.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:47.420
These are easy to do because a
on alpha is alpha times alpha,

00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:51.160
and if you dagger that
equation, a dagger on alpha

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:53.090
is alpha star.

00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:59.720
So you get-- I'll go slowly--
alpha alpha star here,

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:02.055
and then you get alpha alpha.

00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:07.200
And alpha has unit norm.

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:12.350
These are numbers, so
this is equal to length

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:13.605
of alpha squared.

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:23.990
So if this is a
harmonic oscillator,

00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:28.450
the expectation value of the
number operator, in fact,

00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:33.030
is the length squared
of this vector.

00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:35.480
Now, how about N squared?

00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:41.430
N squared is a little
more work because you

00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:47.410
have alpha a dagger
a a dagger a alpha.

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:53.885
This one gives me
the factor you know,

00:14:53.885 --> 00:14:56.182
this one gives me
the factor you know.

00:14:56.182 --> 00:15:04.170
And therefore, we already
have alpha squared times alpha

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:07.950
a a dagger alpha.

00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:10.760
And here, the a's
and the a daggers

00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:14.560
are kind of in the
wrong order because I

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:21.110
know what a is on a ket,
but a is now on the bra.

00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:23.840
And I know what a
dagger is on the bra,

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:27.490
but now a dagger is on the ket.

00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:29.130
But the answer is simple.

00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:34.020
You replace this
by the commutator

00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:37.790
plus the reverse order.

00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:41.580
So this is equal to the
commutator, which is 1,

00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:44.425
plus the thing in
the reverse order.

00:15:49.830 --> 00:15:53.380
And this is 1 plus
alpha squared.

00:15:53.380 --> 00:16:00.610
So you have alpha squared
times 1 plus alpha squared,

00:16:00.610 --> 00:16:03.860
and that's the expectation
value of N squared.

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:07.130
All that, because we're
actually interested in what

00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:13.250
is delta N, the uncertainty
in N in the coherent state.

00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:17.060
And that would be
this, square root

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:21.750
of this, which is alpha
to the fourth plus alpha

00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:28.550
squared minus the square of
the expectation value, which

00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:33.100
is minus alpha to the fourth.

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:38.610
And this is length of alpha.

00:16:38.610 --> 00:16:47.876
So the uncertainty in N
is just length of alpha.

00:16:47.876 --> 00:16:55.710
It happens to be the square root
of the expectation value of N.

00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:59.840
So in fact, if you
think of this picture,

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:03.240
you're tempted to say,
oh, this represents

00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:08.750
the number of excited
states that you have.

00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:14.050
This length represents the
expectation value of N. No.

00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:19.329
The expectation value of
N is this length squared.

00:17:19.329 --> 00:17:27.210
This length represents
delta N in the picture.

00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:36.430
So what else can we say?

00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:40.610
Well, this picture is
useful because now, I

00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:42.905
can be a little
more precise here.

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:49.390
This thing is rotating.

00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:54.660
That is time evolution
of your coherent state.

00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:57.250
Now, this thing
this rotating, but I

00:17:57.250 --> 00:18:00.040
can ask now how wide this is.

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:08.400
So what is the uncertainty
in x in a coherent state?

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:11.190
Well, the uncertainty
in x in a coherent state

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:14.650
is the same as the uncertainty
of the ground state

00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:17.710
because you just moved it.

00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:19.940
Uncertainty doesn't change.

00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:28.080
So the uncertainty,
delta x, is in fact

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:36.460
this quantity that we call
d0 over square root of 2.

00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:42.370
That's the uncertainty delta
x, and the uncertainty delta p

00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:49.640
is h bar over d0
square root of 2.

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:52.670
These are not hard to remember.

00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:57.990
d0 is the length scale of
the harmonic oscillator,

00:18:57.990 --> 00:19:01.080
so that's typically what
the uncertainty should be.

00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:04.620
The square root of 2, yes,
it's hard to remember.

00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:07.000
But delta p is this one.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.540
And then the other
thing that you

00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:12.100
know is that the product
should be h bar over 2,

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:14.030
so that is correct.

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:18.970
Now, look at this.

00:19:18.970 --> 00:19:21.715
How big is this thing?

00:19:21.715 --> 00:19:26.980
If the uncertainty in x is
d0 over square root of 2,

00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:36.540
this width is about
how much, roughly?

00:19:47.985 --> 00:19:48.485
Nobody?

00:19:51.170 --> 00:20:00.230
This is the uncertainty in
x, d0 over square root of 2

00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:04.100
in these units, if you move
the expectation value of x

00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:07.305
plus the uncertainty of x over
2 and the other uncertainty

00:20:07.305 --> 00:20:09.130
of x roughly.

00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:12.310
This thing is d0 over
square root of 2,

00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:17.420
so it represents
basically 1/2, because you

00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:21.440
change the expectation
value of x by this amount,

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:26.330
and then this thing moves 1/2.

00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:30.560
The size of this
is 1/2, roughly.

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:36.240
Could be 1/4 or could be
2, but it's roughly 1/2.

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:43.440
And the vertical one corresponds
to the uncertainty in momentum.

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:47.390
So intuitively, this is
h over square root v0,

00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:53.290
so if you plug it in there,
this amount, p plus delta p,

00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:57.460
you'll get 1/2 as well.

00:20:57.460 --> 00:21:01.872
So in this plot-- yes?

00:21:01.872 --> 00:21:03.800
AUDIENCE: Wouldn't
the width be 1

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:05.728
because the uncertainty
is the width

00:21:05.728 --> 00:21:08.717
in one direction [INAUDIBLE]?

00:21:08.717 --> 00:21:10.300
BARTON ZWIEBACH:
Well, the uncertainty

00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:12.970
is neither the width in
one direction or not.

00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:16.445
It's a Gaussian, so I
don't know where it stops.

00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:26.900
This picture is not very
precise when I talk about this,

00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:32.150
so let me leave it with
1/2 or something like that.

00:21:32.150 --> 00:21:34.390
I don't think we can do better.

00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:37.450
Now, there's also 1/2 here.

00:21:37.450 --> 00:21:43.060
So finally, we get to something
that is kind of interesting.

00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:49.050
If really the state in some
sense, in terms of x and p,

00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:54.020
is spread here, and
this is moving around,

00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:58.000
the face is a little ambiguous.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.350
Because you would say,
well, the face is this one,

00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:08.170
but well, you could go the whole
uncertainty that you go here.

00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:12.120
The uncertainty in where
the coherent state is,

00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:21.370
we could call the face here
delta phi in this picture.

00:22:21.370 --> 00:22:26.640
We don't know where this state
is because it's a little blob.

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:29.310
We know the expectation
values where they are,

00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:32.800
but the state itself
is a little imprecise.

00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:35.790
So there's an angle here
in this diagram that

00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:39.790
represents the face because this
is going with frequency omega

00:22:39.790 --> 00:22:40.460
t.

00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:42.670
So this is the face
as this goes around,

00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:46.865
so this angle, delta
phi, is how much.

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:53.090
Well, if this is
1/2 and this is 1/2,

00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:57.750
I'm going to assume that
this is 1/2 as well, or 1,

00:22:57.750 --> 00:22:59.380
or something like that.

00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:02.510
So it's 1 over this length.

00:23:07.938 --> 00:23:08.896
That's the uncertainty.

00:23:11.530 --> 00:23:17.280
But delta N, we calculated.

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:19.940
This is roughly.

00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:25.480
And delta N we calculated,
and it's exactly alpha.

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:32.540
So delta phi delta N
is about 1 correctly.

00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:39.690
And here, there is
at least a picture

00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:42.890
of what the face uncertainty
is and why it originates.

00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:47.154
Yes?

00:23:47.154 --> 00:23:48.612
AUDIENCE: Can you
tell me again how

00:23:48.612 --> 00:23:50.370
the Gaussian relates
to the uncertainty?

00:23:50.370 --> 00:23:51.536
BARTON ZWIEBACH: One second.

00:23:51.536 --> 00:23:52.050
Let me see.

00:23:52.050 --> 00:23:53.216
I've got one question first.

00:23:53.216 --> 00:23:53.892
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:23:53.892 --> 00:23:57.196
Can you explain one more time
where the 1/2's come from?

00:23:57.196 --> 00:23:58.140
[INAUDIBLE] the graph.

00:23:58.140 --> 00:24:00.500
I'm not sure why.

00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:01.597
BARTON ZWIEBACH: Yes.

00:24:01.597 --> 00:24:04.762
AUDIENCE: Are you saying
that the width is 1/2, or is

00:24:04.762 --> 00:24:06.670
that how high it is?

00:24:06.670 --> 00:24:09.118
BARTON ZWIEBACH: The
width of this little ball.

00:24:09.118 --> 00:24:11.926
AUDIENCE: So how does that
follow from the graph?

00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:19.070
BARTON ZWIEBACH: It's
a little hand wavy,

00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:22.410
but I'll say it like this.

00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:41.480
I expect the
position, if measured,

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:52.535
to be between expectation
value of x plus minus delta x.

00:24:52.535 --> 00:24:56.470
So if I'm going to measure
the position of something

00:24:56.470 --> 00:25:01.440
in a state, the most likely
measurement that I will get

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:04.950
is the expectation value
of x, statistically,

00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:06.770
after I repeat this many times.

00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:10.090
But if I just
measure, I'm probably

00:25:10.090 --> 00:25:15.130
going to get some number
between this and this.

00:25:15.130 --> 00:25:21.620
So if you think of this
diagram not as the expectation

00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:25.310
value of x in here,
but whatever you

00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:31.620
got for x as you measured,
if you do 1,000 measurements,

00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:36.860
you're going to get points
all over here in some region

00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:39.290
because you measure
x in one case,

00:25:39.290 --> 00:25:43.300
then you measure the momentum,
you get a plot of data,

00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:47.120
and you measure them all.

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:51.450
And then suppose you're
doing it with x first.

00:25:51.450 --> 00:25:54.910
You measure x and you say,
well, I get all kinds of values.

00:25:54.910 --> 00:25:56.640
I don't know what
the momentum is,

00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:58.820
but I get all kinds of values.

00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:02.400
They're going to run all
over here between these two

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:04.600
positions.

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:10.910
So when I add to the expectation
value of x this thing,

00:26:10.910 --> 00:26:13.530
when I want to see in
this graph, what it is,

00:26:13.530 --> 00:26:17.540
I must divide by
square root of 2d.

00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:26.770
So I divide by 1 over square
root of 2 d0 to see how it goes

00:26:26.770 --> 00:26:29.330
and how I plot it in
this graph because these

00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:31.660
are the units in this graph.

00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:35.460
So if delta x is d0
over square root of 2,

00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:38.420
I'm going to get some values
that go from the expectation

00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:45.408
value of x up to 1/2
more and 1/2 less.

00:26:45.408 --> 00:26:47.256
AUDIENCE: So it's
not actually 1/2.

00:26:47.256 --> 00:26:51.570
It's actually 1/2 times
whatever that set amount.

00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:53.520
BARTON ZWIEBACH:
Well, if I say this,

00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:56.605
that you obtain between this and
that, then I should say it's 1.

00:27:00.290 --> 00:27:02.590
Maybe I had in mind
that you sort of get

00:27:02.590 --> 00:27:07.740
most things between
1/2 of delta x.

00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:11.250
It's not terribly
precise, but it's

00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:12.790
roughly this is the picture.

00:27:12.790 --> 00:27:15.680
You measure the position,
you're going to get that.

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:18.700
Similarly, you decide
to measure momentum.

00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:20.760
You don't measure
position, measure momentum,

00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:24.440
and you're going to get
roughly the expectation value,

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:28.270
but you're going to get a
little plus minus uncertainty.

00:27:28.270 --> 00:27:30.970
So you're going to all points
here in your measurement.

00:27:30.970 --> 00:27:34.740
So this dashed thing
is your histogram

00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:37.350
after doing lots of experiments.

00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:40.370
You have lots of dots in here.

00:27:40.370 --> 00:27:44.190
And roughly, this is
how it comes about.

00:27:44.190 --> 00:27:47.980
It's not terribly precise
because I cannot put a point

00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:52.520
either here, because if I
say the measurement was this,

00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:56.330
I'm suggesting that I also
measured the momentum on that

00:27:56.330 --> 00:28:00.150
state, or I could only
measure the position.

00:28:00.150 --> 00:28:02.730
But it's a rough
idea, rough picture,

00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:05.130
of how big the spread is here.

00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:07.370
There is a mathematical
theory to do

00:28:07.370 --> 00:28:11.400
this more precisely, although
physically not much clearer,

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:15.540
which are called
Wigner distributions.

00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:18.680
I don't think it helps
too much to understand it,

00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:22.480
but the rough picture
is relatively clear.

00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:25.880
So if you divide by 1
over square root of 2,

00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:31.380
this quantity that was equal
to d over square root of 2,

00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:38.420
you get, in this scale plus
1/2 and minus 1/2, so 1, 1, 1,

00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:41.630
and this value there.

00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:42.840
There was a question there.

00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:44.880
Yes?

00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:47.838
AUDIENCE: Can you explain
again how the Gaussian relates

00:28:47.838 --> 00:28:49.372
to the uncertainty [INAUDIBLE]?

00:28:56.540 --> 00:28:58.180
BARTON ZWIEBACH:
So I don't know how

00:28:58.180 --> 00:29:00.520
the Gaussian relates
to uncertainty in x.

00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:05.500
So basically, we computed the
uncertainty in x for the ground

00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:08.820
state, and I claimed that
for a coherent state,

00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:12.120
the uncertainty in x cannot
change because you just took

00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:14.280
the state and you moved it away.

00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:17.980
And the uncertainty
of x doesn't talk

00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:21.390
about what the
expectation value of x is.

00:29:21.390 --> 00:29:23.540
That changes when
you move a state.

00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:26.980
But just how much it's
spread and how much

00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:30.740
the state is spread is not
changed by a translation.

00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:35.240
So this is the old result for
the ground state uncertainty,

00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:37.760
ground state uncertainty,
and neither is changed.

00:29:44.430 --> 00:29:47.055
Let's go now into
our squeezed states.

00:29:57.030 --> 00:30:01.300
So what are going to
be squeezed states?

00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:04.200
They're going to be
pretty useful states.

00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:06.840
They have lots of
applications nowadays.

00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:11.930
They've been constructed
over the last 10 years

00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:14.550
more and more often,
and people are now

00:30:14.550 --> 00:30:18.670
able to construct what is called
squeezed states experimentally.

00:30:18.670 --> 00:30:20.340
And the way we're
going to motivate it

00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:27.190
is by imagining that you have a
harmonic oscillator, a particle

00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:37.770
n, and some spring,
k, or an omega.

00:30:37.770 --> 00:30:39.400
And there's a Hamiltonian.

00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:51.220
H is equal to p squared over 2
m plus 1/2 m omega x squared.

00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:53.220
But this Hamiltonian
is going to be

00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:58.920
the Hamiltonian of a
particle that has mass m1,

00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:05.300
and the oscillator
has frequency w1,

00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:09.940
and that's what we're going
to call the first Hamiltonian.

00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:14.270
After a little while, you
observe this Hamiltonian.

00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:20.560
I will erase this thing.

00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:21.690
We don't need them anymore.

00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:46.380
We observe this thing and this
has an uncertainty, delta x,

00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:51.710
proportional to-- we know this v
over square root of 2, so h bar

00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:55.830
over 2 m1 omega 1.

00:31:55.830 --> 00:32:03.560
And an uncertainty in
p, which is delta p

00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:10.540
equals square root of h
bar m1 omega 1 over 2.

00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:14.410
And again, they
saturate the bound

00:32:14.410 --> 00:32:17.950
if you have your ground state.

00:32:17.950 --> 00:32:19.770
So ground state is here.

00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:27.220
These two uncertainties,
the bound is saturated,

00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:30.620
all is good.

00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:34.730
Nevertheless, suddenly,
at time equals

00:32:34.730 --> 00:32:40.000
0, this state, this particle,
is in the ground state.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.930
The Hamiltonian changes.

00:32:43.930 --> 00:32:47.810
There's an abrupt
change in the physics.

00:32:47.810 --> 00:32:52.270
Maybe the temperature
was changed

00:32:52.270 --> 00:32:59.400
and the spring constant
changed, or the particle, a drop

00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:02.320
was added to it and
its mass changed,

00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:06.550
but the Hamiltonian has
changed all of a sudden.

00:33:06.550 --> 00:33:16.470
So this Hamiltonian, H1,
is valid for H less than 0

00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:22.490
and a particle in
the ground state.

00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:27.720
So the particle's
in the ground state,

00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:33.760
the Hamiltonian is fine there,
but suddenly, the Hamiltonian

00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:36.020
changes.

00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:38.560
The particle identity
has not changed.

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:44.860
The particle is there, but it
is the Hamilton that changes.

00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:49.480
So there's an H2,
p squared over 2 m2

00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:55.550
plus 1/2 m squared w
squared 2 x squared.

00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:00.580
The picture is physically clean.

00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:03.830
The particle is sitting
there in the ground state,

00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:08.480
and suddenly, the parameters
of the system change.

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:12.350
So this particle was
having a good time,

00:34:12.350 --> 00:34:15.679
it was at the ground
state, relaxed.

00:34:15.679 --> 00:34:20.870
Then suddenly, the wave function
didn't change at time equals 0.

00:34:20.870 --> 00:34:23.110
It was spread over
some distance.

00:34:23.110 --> 00:34:25.690
No measurement
was done, nothing.

00:34:25.690 --> 00:34:29.179
And suddenly, this
particle finds itself

00:34:29.179 --> 00:34:33.590
with some wave function
but in another Hamiltonian.

00:34:33.590 --> 00:34:36.620
From now on, its
time evolution is

00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:39.080
going to be governed by
the second Hamiltonian.

00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:43.719
Now, since the
second Hamiltonian

00:34:43.719 --> 00:34:47.000
is different from the
first Hamiltonian,

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:50.350
this particle is not going to
be any more in the ground state.

00:34:50.350 --> 00:34:53.900
Even though it was in the ground
state of the first Hamiltonian,

00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:57.490
it's not anymore in the ground
state of the second Hamiltonian

00:34:57.490 --> 00:35:00.620
as soon as the thing
gets turned on.

00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:06.250
So for t greater than 0,
this Hamilton is there.

00:35:06.250 --> 00:35:12.410
So actually, the wave
function does not change, so

00:35:12.410 --> 00:35:17.660
let me write delta x, and I'll
write it the following way,

00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:22.160
h bar over 2 m2 omega 1.

00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:24.600
But you say, no,
delta x didn't change.

00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:25.450
Correct.

00:35:25.450 --> 00:35:35.560
So I'll put the factor
m2 w2 over m1 w1,

00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:37.515
and now it's the same delta x.

00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:45.810
Similarly, for delta
p, I will write

00:35:45.810 --> 00:35:53.270
that this is square root
of h bar m2 omega 2 over 2,

00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:58.750
and put the factor m1
omega 1 over m2 omega

00:35:58.750 --> 00:36:01.280
2 in front in such
a way that it is

00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:05.430
the same delta x and
the same delta p.

00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:14.240
Now, delta x times delta p
multiply to be h bar over 2,

00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:16.560
and they still
multiply to that number

00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:18.860
because I didn't change them.

00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:28.091
But this is equal-- I'll call
this number e to the minus

00:36:28.091 --> 00:36:28.590
gamma.

00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:36.590
I'll go to another blackboard.

00:36:36.590 --> 00:36:44.020
Delta x is e to the minus
gamma times square root

00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:50.380
of h bar over 2 m2 omega 2.

00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:54.790
And delta p is e to
the gamma, because it's

00:36:54.790 --> 00:36:58.130
the inverse factor
on the one that we

00:36:58.130 --> 00:37:07.850
call gamma, square root of
h bar m2 omega 2 over 2,

00:37:07.850 --> 00:37:14.790
where e to the gamma is
the square root of m1 omega

00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:17.275
1 over m2 omega 2.

00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:22.870
Look, we've done
very simple things.

00:37:22.870 --> 00:37:25.510
We haven't done really much.

00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:29.560
But already, we start
to see what's happening.

00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:34.440
From the viewpoint of
the second Hamiltonian,

00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:38.210
these uncertainties
are not right.

00:37:38.210 --> 00:37:41.180
They are not the uncertainties
of the ground state,

00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:44.020
because from the viewpoint
of the second Hamiltonian,

00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:46.330
the ground state
uncertainty is this

00:37:46.330 --> 00:37:48.540
and the ground state
uncertainty is this.

00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:52.060
And indeed, this particle
was in the ground state,

00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:55.720
it had some Gaussian,
but that's not

00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:58.540
the right Gaussian for
the second Hamiltonian.

00:37:58.540 --> 00:38:01.420
It's the right Gaussian
for the first Hamiltonian.

00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:05.530
So it's not in the ground state
of the second Hamiltonian,

00:38:05.530 --> 00:38:13.465
but it's in a particular state
in which, if gamma is positive,

00:38:13.465 --> 00:38:19.020
the uncertainty in x is squeezed
from the lowest uncertainty

00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:22.660
that you get in an
energy eigenstate.

00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:24.160
And the uncertainty
and the momentum

00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:27.050
will be stretched
in that direction.

00:38:27.050 --> 00:38:32.910
So you see, in the ground state
of the harmonic oscillator,

00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:37.730
you get that uncertainty, and
that's a canonical uncertainty.

00:38:37.730 --> 00:38:40.690
But this uncertainty is
squeezed because it's

00:38:40.690 --> 00:38:43.370
different from what it should
be, and this is squeezed.

00:38:43.370 --> 00:38:48.420
So from the viewpoint of
the second Hamiltonian,

00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:52.290
the ground state of
the first Hamiltonian

00:38:52.290 --> 00:38:54.840
is a squeezed state.

00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:57.790
It's a staple
whose uncertainties

00:38:57.790 --> 00:38:59.900
have been squeezed.

00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:02.580
And those states
exist, and the purpose

00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:04.150
of what we're going
to do now is try

00:39:04.150 --> 00:39:07.610
to determine them, find
them, see what they are,

00:39:07.610 --> 00:39:08.290
how they behave.

00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:12.615
Any questions?

00:39:16.430 --> 00:39:18.154
Yes, Nicholas?

00:39:18.154 --> 00:39:19.740
AUDIENCE: I'm a
little confused why

00:39:19.740 --> 00:39:25.216
we can say that delta x
[INAUDIBLE] these new ones are

00:39:25.216 --> 00:39:28.920
just related to the old
ones by this factor.

00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:30.040
BARTON ZWIEBACH: OK.

00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:38.260
You see, what I assumed is
that before time equals 0,

00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:40.670
you had a Gaussian.

00:39:40.670 --> 00:39:42.860
That was the original Gaussian.

00:39:42.860 --> 00:39:44.770
That was the original
wave function,

00:39:44.770 --> 00:39:48.650
and you had some delta
x and some delta p that

00:39:48.650 --> 00:39:51.840
were given by this
one [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:56.240
Now, I didn't do anything except
rewrite the same quantities

00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:59.100
here, because what
I said next was

00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:01.780
that even though
at time equals 0,

00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:05.360
the Hamiltonian changes,
at time equals 0,

00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:08.110
the wave function
doesn't change.

00:40:08.110 --> 00:40:09.840
The wave function
remains the same.

00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:11.960
After that time,
it's going to start

00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:14.780
changing because the new
Hamiltonian kicks in.

00:40:14.780 --> 00:40:18.230
But this delta x's
are the same as

00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:20.720
that I wrote, and
here are the same.

00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:26.070
But here, you see clearly
that this delta x with respect

00:40:26.070 --> 00:40:29.300
to the second Hamiltonian
is not the one

00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:31.270
that it would be if
it would be a ground

00:40:31.270 --> 00:40:34.680
state, nor the delta p.

00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:35.836
Yes?

00:40:35.836 --> 00:40:39.514
AUDIENCE: Just at the instant
you change the Hamiltonian,

00:40:39.514 --> 00:40:41.180
because they might
have all [INAUDIBLE],

00:40:41.180 --> 00:40:42.940
the uncertainties would change.

00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:44.943
BARTON ZWIEBACH: Sorry?

00:40:44.943 --> 00:40:47.058
AUDIENCE: Is this just
at the instant where

00:40:47.058 --> 00:40:49.182
we change the Hamiltonian,
because after some time,

00:40:49.182 --> 00:40:50.974
the wave function might
change [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:50.974 --> 00:40:52.223
BARTON ZWIEBACH: That's right.

00:40:52.223 --> 00:40:54.530
This is just after I
change the Hamiltonian.

00:40:54.530 --> 00:40:57.180
The time evolution of
this state is something

00:40:57.180 --> 00:40:59.040
that we have to
figure out later.

00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:01.800
But after I've changed
the Hamiltonian,

00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:04.710
the state looks squeezed.

00:41:04.710 --> 00:41:10.130
So how can we calculate and
understand these things?

00:41:10.130 --> 00:41:17.310
So the way to think of
this is the following.

00:41:17.310 --> 00:41:21.520
You see, you have this
system of two Hamiltonians.

00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:26.260
There's an x and a p operator,
and the second Hamiltonian

00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:28.510
has an x and a p operator.

00:41:28.510 --> 00:41:31.960
These are the properties
of the particles.

00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:35.000
Therefore, what that
I'm going to think of

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:38.230
is that the x and
the p operators

00:41:38.230 --> 00:41:42.700
are the operators that
describe the particle.

00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:48.210
They are unchanged
because we're talking

00:41:48.210 --> 00:41:52.020
about this same
object, same particle.

00:41:52.020 --> 00:42:01.895
So if I have the x operator,
which is equal to this formula,

00:42:01.895 --> 00:42:14.470
h bar over 2 m1 omega 1 a1
dagger plus a1 like this.

00:42:14.470 --> 00:42:18.700
From the first
Hamiltonian, the x's

00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:21.600
are related to a1's
and a1 daggers,

00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:25.780
but this is the same x
describing the same position

00:42:25.780 --> 00:42:28.650
as you would do in the
second Hamiltonian.

00:42:28.650 --> 00:42:39.810
So m2 w2 a2 hat
plus a2 hat dagger.

00:42:39.810 --> 00:42:43.400
It's a very strong physical
assumption I'm making here.

00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:46.700
It's an assumption that's
so strong that in many ways,

00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:48.860
you could almost say,
well, I'll buy it,

00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:52.560
but we'll see if it gives
something reasonable.

00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:58.030
I'm saying the x operator
is really the same thing,

00:42:58.030 --> 00:43:00.420
and you could view
it as constructed

00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:02.930
from ingredients of
the first Hamiltonian

00:43:02.930 --> 00:43:05.220
or the second Hamiltonian.

00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:07.610
So is the p operator.

00:43:07.610 --> 00:43:14.060
p, which is-- well, I
have a formula here--

00:43:14.060 --> 00:43:24.420
minus i m1 omega 1 h bar
over 2 a1 minus a1 dagger--

00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:30.460
should be the same as
minus i m2 omega 2 h bar

00:43:30.460 --> 00:43:34.000
over 2 a2 minus a2 dagger.

00:43:42.150 --> 00:43:48.940
So x and p are not changing.

00:43:48.940 --> 00:43:51.960
We're not talking about
two particles that

00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:55.500
have an x1 and a p1, and
the second particle, an x2

00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:56.710
and a p2.

00:43:56.710 --> 00:44:00.920
It's just one particle
has an x and a p

00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:03.235
is what you observe when
you measure position

00:44:03.235 --> 00:44:06.020
and you observe when
you measure momentum.

00:44:06.020 --> 00:44:09.510
Nevertheless, x and p
are related in this way

00:44:09.510 --> 00:44:13.070
to the creation and
annihilation operators.

00:44:13.070 --> 00:44:18.450
So we're going to find from
this some very strange relation

00:44:18.450 --> 00:44:21.620
between the creation
operators, the annihilation

00:44:21.620 --> 00:44:25.310
operators of the first
system and the second system.

00:44:25.310 --> 00:44:27.020
So what do we get, in fact?

00:44:27.020 --> 00:44:30.170
Well, the constants disappear
from the first equation

00:44:30.170 --> 00:44:35.500
roughly, and you get a1
dagger is equal to-- you

00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:40.100
get the ratio of m1
omega 1 over m2 omega 2,

00:44:40.100 --> 00:44:48.390
so you get e to the gamma
a1 a2 plus a2 dagger.

00:44:51.270 --> 00:44:58.590
From the bottom one,
a1 minus a1 dagger

00:44:58.590 --> 00:45:07.830
is equal to e to the minus
gamma a2 minus a2 dagger.

00:45:07.830 --> 00:45:09.650
These two equations
give you that.

00:45:09.650 --> 00:45:11.520
It should be clear.

00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:14.190
You just cancel the
constants and remember

00:45:14.190 --> 00:45:16.050
the definition of
e to the gamma.

00:45:18.620 --> 00:45:25.550
And now we can solve
for a1 and a1 dagger

00:45:25.550 --> 00:45:28.860
in terms of a2 and a2 dagger.

00:45:28.860 --> 00:45:31.790
And what do we find?

00:45:31.790 --> 00:45:49.600
a1 is equal to a2 cosh gamma
plus a2 dagger sinch gamma,

00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:52.090
and the dagger is what
you would imagine.

00:45:52.090 --> 00:45:59.760
So a1 dagger is equal
to a2 dagger cosh

00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:04.675
gamma plus a2 sinch gamma.

00:46:10.250 --> 00:46:15.920
The second equation
that you can calculate

00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:17.920
is the dagger of the first.

00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:19.890
It should be that.

00:46:19.890 --> 00:46:25.820
And now you've
found the scrambling

00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:28.935
of the creation,
annihilation operators.

00:46:34.030 --> 00:46:38.040
The old annihilation
operator is a mixture

00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:43.320
of the new annihilation operator
and a creation operator.

00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:44.820
They're mixed.

00:46:44.820 --> 00:46:49.750
It's a very strange
thing that has happened,

00:46:49.750 --> 00:46:54.930
a mixture between creation
and annihilation operators.

00:46:54.930 --> 00:46:57.910
This is so famous in
physics, it has a name.

00:46:57.910 --> 00:47:02.470
It's called the
Bogoliubov transformation.

00:47:02.470 --> 00:47:07.610
It appears in the analysis
of black hole radiation.

00:47:07.610 --> 00:47:09.490
There's a Bogoliubov
transformation

00:47:09.490 --> 00:47:11.900
between the fields far
away of the black hole

00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:13.580
and the fields near
the black hole.

00:47:13.580 --> 00:47:14.890
It appears everywhere.

00:47:17.590 --> 00:47:20.210
And here it has
appeared, so we're

00:47:20.210 --> 00:47:24.550
going to try to understand
what it does for us.

00:47:24.550 --> 00:47:29.540
Similarly, you can
find what a2 is

00:47:29.540 --> 00:47:35.390
in terms of a1's by the
symmetry of these equations.

00:47:35.390 --> 00:47:39.020
This corresponds to
actually letting gamma

00:47:39.020 --> 00:47:44.200
go to minus gamma, because
if you pass these gammas

00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:48.510
to the other side, the
equations are of the same form.

00:47:48.510 --> 00:47:52.350
By letting 1 become 2,
2 becomes 1 and gamma

00:47:52.350 --> 00:47:55.480
goes to minus gamma.

00:47:55.480 --> 00:47:59.090
So we don't need it right
now, but in case you

00:47:59.090 --> 00:48:03.870
want to find the other ones,
the 2's in terms of the 1's, you

00:48:03.870 --> 00:48:10.830
would just change the sign of
gamma and it would work out.

00:48:10.830 --> 00:48:19.380
So this relation is the key to
allow you to calculate things.

00:48:19.380 --> 00:48:21.135
So what do we want to calculate?

00:48:25.010 --> 00:48:32.710
Well, here is what I
would like to calculate.

00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:37.930
The ground state of
the first oscillator

00:48:37.930 --> 00:48:39.470
is this thing we had.

00:48:39.470 --> 00:48:42.990
It's the thing that
has the wave function.

00:48:42.990 --> 00:48:48.190
But I want to express it as
a superposition of states

00:48:48.190 --> 00:48:52.320
of the second oscillator
because the second oscillator is

00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:54.300
what gives you the
new Hamiltonian

00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:57.250
and what's going to tell
you how the state is

00:48:57.250 --> 00:48:58.770
going to evolve later.

00:48:58.770 --> 00:49:06.830
So presumably, this state is
some number times the ground

00:49:06.830 --> 00:49:13.980
state of the second
oscillator, plus maybe

00:49:13.980 --> 00:49:21.120
some creation operator on
the second vacuum as well

00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:23.660
with a constant.

00:49:23.660 --> 00:49:34.630
Now, this wave function of
the ground state is even,

00:49:34.630 --> 00:49:39.005
and I would expect that
it's a superposition of even

00:49:39.005 --> 00:49:43.990
eigenstates of the second
oscillator as well.

00:49:43.990 --> 00:49:46.710
And even eigenstates
are things that

00:49:46.710 --> 00:49:48.530
have even occupation numbers.

00:49:48.530 --> 00:49:51.030
Those are the even
Hermite polynomials.

00:49:51.030 --> 00:49:56.070
So presumably, it goes
like this and things

00:49:56.070 --> 00:49:58.510
with four oscillators
and things like that.

00:49:58.510 --> 00:50:02.970
So what that after is
this sort of expression

00:50:02.970 --> 00:50:08.670
of the original state in terms
of energy eigenstates in terms

00:50:08.670 --> 00:50:11.365
of anything of the
second oscillator.

00:50:14.230 --> 00:50:16.610
So how can we do that?

00:50:16.610 --> 00:50:20.270
Well, one thing we
know about this state

00:50:20.270 --> 00:50:30.415
is that a1 [? on it ?]
is equal to 0.

00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:44.910
It's killed by a1, but that
a1 is an interesting thing.

00:50:44.910 --> 00:50:54.240
It's a2 cosh gamma plus
a2 dagger sinch gamma,

00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:57.055
and that thing must
kill that state.

00:51:00.590 --> 00:51:08.430
So I could at least, if I had
infinite time, put a few terms

00:51:08.430 --> 00:51:11.860
and try to calculate more
or less what kind of state

00:51:11.860 --> 00:51:16.590
is killed by this strange
combination of creation

00:51:16.590 --> 00:51:19.180
and annihilation operators.

00:51:19.180 --> 00:51:23.700
You see, we know
a ground state is

00:51:23.700 --> 00:51:26.450
killed by the normal
annihilation operator.

00:51:26.450 --> 00:51:28.700
That's what this is.

00:51:28.700 --> 00:51:31.680
But this operator,
now we know it's

00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:34.610
given by this
formula over there,

00:51:34.610 --> 00:51:38.940
and then it must kill all that.

00:51:38.940 --> 00:51:43.360
So we're faced with a problem
that is in principle fairly

00:51:43.360 --> 00:51:49.350
difficult, and you could not
hope for an except solution

00:51:49.350 --> 00:51:52.810
unless there's something
very nice going on.

00:51:52.810 --> 00:51:55.830
Happily, squeezed states
are still very nice

00:51:55.830 --> 00:52:03.550
and tractable states, so
let's see what we can do.

00:52:03.550 --> 00:52:06.660
Well, what I'm going to
do is to put an ansatz

00:52:06.660 --> 00:52:12.580
for this state based on this
expansion that I had there.

00:52:12.580 --> 00:52:21.290
I would say, look, there's going
to be a normalization constant,

00:52:21.290 --> 00:52:25.000
but at the end of the
day, we have things acting

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:27.980
on the vacuum, so there's
going to be something very

00:52:27.980 --> 00:52:31.560
messy acting on the vacuum of 2.

00:52:36.099 --> 00:52:39.960
And what is that going to be?

00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:42.310
Well, we've learned about
coherent states that

00:52:42.310 --> 00:52:46.540
are exponentials of
oscillators, exponentials

00:52:46.540 --> 00:52:50.640
of a's and a daggers added.

00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:52.950
So here, we're going
to attempt something

00:52:52.950 --> 00:52:55.040
a little more general.

00:52:55.040 --> 00:53:04.620
I'll put an exponential minus
1/2, and what should I put?

00:53:04.620 --> 00:53:09.700
Well, let's try to be
simple minded still.

00:53:09.700 --> 00:53:14.690
It seems to go in even power,
so if we're very lucky,

00:53:14.690 --> 00:53:20.170
maybe we can put just an
a2 dagger a2 dagger here,

00:53:20.170 --> 00:53:23.510
an exponential something
quadratic in oscillators.

00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:28.745
And I don't know what the
coefficient is in front,

00:53:28.745 --> 00:53:31.810
and it may depend
on gamma because I

00:53:31.810 --> 00:53:33.550
have to solve an
equation with gamma.

00:53:33.550 --> 00:53:41.370
So I'll put minus 1/2
f of gamma times that.

00:53:43.880 --> 00:53:49.870
And we'll see if
we can solve this.

00:53:49.870 --> 00:53:52.000
So what does it
mean to solve it?

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:57.960
Well, it means that it must be
annihilated by this operator.

00:53:57.960 --> 00:54:01.485
So our computations with the
creation and annihilation

00:54:01.485 --> 00:54:03.845
operators are becoming
more and more complicated.

00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:08.960
They look more and
more complicated.

00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:11.580
They're really not harder.

00:54:11.580 --> 00:54:12.850
Let's see what happens.

00:54:12.850 --> 00:54:23.260
So I need now that a2 cosh
gamma plus a2 dagger sinch gamma

00:54:23.260 --> 00:54:26.030
kill this state.

00:54:26.030 --> 00:54:28.470
So the N is going to go outside.

00:54:28.470 --> 00:54:29.210
It's a number.

00:54:29.210 --> 00:54:35.190
So acting on e to the
minus 1/2 f of gamma a2

00:54:35.190 --> 00:54:41.750
dagger a2 dagger on the
vacuum sub 2, that must be 0.

00:54:48.220 --> 00:54:49.805
How does one solve this?

00:54:52.360 --> 00:54:56.830
Well, let's see what we have.

00:54:56.830 --> 00:54:59.860
Let's see this term.

00:54:59.860 --> 00:55:03.700
a2 dagger, good.

00:55:03.700 --> 00:55:06.270
a2 dagger commutes
with a2 dagger,

00:55:06.270 --> 00:55:10.990
so I can bring the a2 dagger
all the way to the right

00:55:10.990 --> 00:55:16.450
and it doesn't kill the vacuum,
so I don't gain anything.

00:55:16.450 --> 00:55:19.080
Can be to the right or
to the left because it

00:55:19.080 --> 00:55:22.250
commutes with this whole thing,
so I haven't gained anything

00:55:22.250 --> 00:55:25.710
if I move it, so false start.

00:55:25.710 --> 00:55:28.200
I don't want to move that one.

00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:30.760
This one, I want
to leave it here,

00:55:30.760 --> 00:55:33.390
and this one
somehow must produce

00:55:33.390 --> 00:55:35.230
something that cancels this one.

00:55:39.190 --> 00:55:43.340
Now, a2, on the other
hand, is the kind of thing

00:55:43.340 --> 00:55:46.860
that always should be dealt with
because this is an annihilator

00:55:46.860 --> 00:55:49.200
and that does kill that.

00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:52.960
So as it moves along,
it encounters obstacles,

00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:58.420
but obstacles are opportunities
because an obstacle means

00:55:58.420 --> 00:56:03.530
we're going to get something
that maybe cancels that.

00:56:03.530 --> 00:56:06.360
So if it also went through
and killed the vacuum,

00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:07.090
we're finished.

00:56:07.090 --> 00:56:09.020
This doesn't kill the vacuum.

00:56:09.020 --> 00:56:11.300
Happily, it gets stuck here.

00:56:11.300 --> 00:56:12.990
Now the thing that
we have to hope

00:56:12.990 --> 00:56:17.670
is that we can disentangle
that commutator.

00:56:17.670 --> 00:56:20.050
Now, here is a universal thing.

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:28.270
How do I want to write this?

00:56:28.270 --> 00:56:31.910
I'm going to write it like this.

00:56:31.910 --> 00:56:35.720
I have an a2, a
number, I don't care

00:56:35.720 --> 00:56:38.200
about the number, and
a complicated thing,

00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:39.640
and a vacuum.

00:56:39.640 --> 00:56:45.640
Whenever you have an a,
any operator, and a vacuum,

00:56:45.640 --> 00:56:49.380
this is equal to a
commutator with the operator

00:56:49.380 --> 00:56:51.290
on the vacuum.

00:56:51.290 --> 00:56:57.200
That should be second
nature because this is even

00:56:57.200 --> 00:57:02.980
given to that minus oa, but
oa, the a is near to the vacuum

00:57:02.980 --> 00:57:04.030
and it kills it.

00:57:04.030 --> 00:57:08.020
So whenever you
have an a o vacuum,

00:57:08.020 --> 00:57:11.310
you can put the commutator,
so I'll do that here.

00:57:11.310 --> 00:57:19.980
So I put a2, the cosh
gamma, I take it out.

00:57:19.980 --> 00:57:25.110
I put this whole thing minus
1/2 f a dagger a dagger 2.

00:57:27.810 --> 00:57:33.830
This whole thing and the vacuum.

00:57:33.830 --> 00:57:36.860
That's the first term.

00:57:36.860 --> 00:57:40.970
And the second term, I
have to just copy it.

00:57:40.970 --> 00:57:49.270
Sinch gamma a2 dagger
e to the minus 1/2 fa

00:57:49.270 --> 00:57:52.800
squared dagger on the vacuum.

00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:54.230
All that should be 0.

00:57:59.580 --> 00:58:04.460
So what do we get?

00:58:04.460 --> 00:58:07.273
Is that commutator
doable or undoable?

00:58:10.740 --> 00:58:13.410
It's happily a
simple commutator,

00:58:13.410 --> 00:58:16.990
even if it doesn't look
like it, because whenever

00:58:16.990 --> 00:58:22.270
you see a commutator like
that, you think A to the B,

00:58:22.270 --> 00:58:25.020
and then you know
if you're in luck,

00:58:25.020 --> 00:58:30.240
this is just AB e to
the B, and this is true

00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:37.800
if AB commutes with
B. So that's what

00:58:37.800 --> 00:58:42.350
you must think whenever
you see these things.

00:58:42.350 --> 00:58:46.800
Do mind this lucky situation.

00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:53.140
Yes, you are, because
with this commutator,

00:58:53.140 --> 00:58:55.520
one a will kill an
a dagger, so you

00:58:55.520 --> 00:58:58.250
will be left with an dagger.

00:58:58.250 --> 00:59:04.340
But a dagger commutes with b,
which is a dagger a dagger.

00:59:04.340 --> 00:59:12.360
So AB, A with B is
just add an a dagger up

00:59:12.360 --> 00:59:16.030
to a function or a number, and
then a dagger commutes with B

00:59:16.030 --> 00:59:17.830
so you are in good shape.

00:59:17.830 --> 00:59:18.990
This is true.

00:59:18.990 --> 00:59:20.570
So what do we get here?

00:59:20.570 --> 00:59:25.600
We get cosh gamma,
and then we just

00:59:25.600 --> 00:59:32.465
get the commutator
of a2 with minus 1/2

00:59:32.465 --> 00:59:41.512
f a2 dagger a2 dagger times
the whole exponential--

00:59:41.512 --> 00:59:47.980
I won't write it-- times
the vacuum plus sinch times

00:59:47.980 --> 00:59:52.670
a2 dagger times the whole
exponential times the vacuum.

01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:04.210
We have to do this commutator,
but the f doesn't matter.

01:00:04.210 --> 01:00:05.220
It's a constant.

01:00:05.220 --> 01:00:06.560
It's a function.

01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:11.460
No operator in there. a2
with a2 daggers are 1.

01:00:11.460 --> 01:00:13.690
There are two of
them, so you get a 2,

01:00:13.690 --> 01:00:21.372
and the 1/2 cancels this,
so you get minus cosh gamma

01:00:21.372 --> 01:00:32.730
f a2 dagger times
the exponential plus,

01:00:32.730 --> 01:00:42.490
from the other term, sinch gamma
a2 dagger times the exponential

01:00:42.490 --> 01:00:46.070
on the vacuum equals 0.

01:00:46.070 --> 01:00:49.570
And, as promised, we were good.

01:00:49.570 --> 01:00:52.450
We get an a2 dagger, a2 dagger.

01:00:52.450 --> 01:01:00.176
These two terms cancel if f
is equal to tan hyperbolic

01:01:00.176 --> 01:01:05.640
of gamma, which is
sine over cosine

01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:08.790
so that these two things cancel.

01:01:08.790 --> 01:01:18.590
I can write this, of course, as
minus cosh gamma f plus sinch

01:01:18.590 --> 01:01:24.970
gamma a2 dagger, the
exponential, and the vacuum,

01:01:24.970 --> 01:01:25.820
equals 0.

01:01:25.820 --> 01:01:30.580
So it's just a simple
relation, but there we go.

01:01:30.580 --> 01:01:34.060
Tanh gamma is the thing.

01:01:34.060 --> 01:01:38.590
Tanh gamma gives you
the answer, and let

01:01:38.590 --> 01:01:43.210
me write this state
so that you enjoy it.

01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:49.540
Let's see.

01:01:49.540 --> 01:01:55.410
The state is just a
fairly interesting thing,

01:01:55.410 --> 01:02:03.990
this 01 expressed in the new
Hilbert space of the second

01:02:03.990 --> 01:02:10.480
oscillator is some n of gamma
times the exponential of minus

01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:17.220
1/2 tangent hyperbolic
of gamma a2 dagger,

01:02:17.220 --> 01:02:21.965
a2 dagger on the vacuum sub 2.

01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:40.580
And you need the
normalization, n of gamma,

01:02:40.580 --> 01:02:42.520
and it will be done.

01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:44.990
Now, the normalization,
you may say well, look,

01:02:44.990 --> 01:02:47.560
normalizations are good things.

01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:51.580
Sometimes, you work without
normalizations and you're OK,

01:02:51.580 --> 01:02:55.350
but it turns out that these
normalizations are pretty

01:02:55.350 --> 01:02:59.080
useful, and unless you get
them, some calculations

01:02:59.080 --> 01:03:03.150
are kind of undoable.

01:03:03.150 --> 01:03:06.610
So it's a little
bit of a challenge

01:03:06.610 --> 01:03:09.480
to get that normalization.

01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:12.220
You can try in several ways.

01:03:12.220 --> 01:03:16.860
The most naive way
is to say, well, this

01:03:16.860 --> 01:03:21.040
must have unit
norms, so n squared,

01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:25.300
and then I take the bra of
this and the ket of that,

01:03:25.300 --> 01:03:29.430
so it would be a vacuum,
an exponential of minus 1/2

01:03:29.430 --> 01:03:34.430
tangent a a, and an
exponential of minus 1/2

01:03:34.430 --> 01:03:37.890
tangent a dagger, a dagger.

01:03:37.890 --> 01:03:40.820
Must be 1.

01:03:40.820 --> 01:03:43.260
n squared times that.

01:03:43.260 --> 01:03:48.240
The problem is that I've never
been able to compute this.

01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:51.020
At least it takes a
long time and you get it

01:03:51.020 --> 01:03:54.870
by indirect methods, but
getting a number out of this

01:03:54.870 --> 01:03:57.170
is painful.

01:03:57.170 --> 01:04:01.820
So there's one way of getting
the normalization here

01:04:01.820 --> 01:04:04.220
that is not so bad.

01:04:04.220 --> 01:04:07.935
It's a little
surprising what you do.

01:04:07.935 --> 01:04:09.980
You do the following.

01:04:09.980 --> 01:04:11.840
You declare, I'm
going to compute

01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:17.825
the overlap of 2, the vacuum
of 2, with the vacuum of 1.

01:04:26.930 --> 01:04:36.460
And now, what is this,
n gamma vacuum of 2

01:04:36.460 --> 01:04:45.270
here, e to the minus 1/2 tanh
gamma a2 dagger a2 dagger

01:04:45.270 --> 01:04:47.800
vacuum of 2.

01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:53.690
How difficult is it to
compute this inner product?

01:04:53.690 --> 01:04:54.950
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:04:54.950 --> 01:04:56.270
BARTON ZWIEBACH: Sorry?

01:04:56.270 --> 01:04:57.270
AUDIENCE: Not difficult.

01:04:57.270 --> 01:04:58.561
BARTON ZWIEBACH: Not difficult.

01:04:58.561 --> 01:05:00.534
What is it?

01:05:00.534 --> 01:05:01.520
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:03.694
BARTON ZWIEBACH:
Yeah, that thing.

01:05:03.694 --> 01:05:06.283
AUDIENCE: e to the
negative 1/2 tanh gamma.

01:05:09.061 --> 01:05:10.450
It's 1.

01:05:10.450 --> 01:05:11.923
BARTON ZWIEBACH: Sorry?

01:05:11.923 --> 01:05:14.445
AUDIENCE: I mean, you
multiply the a2 dagger right

01:05:14.445 --> 01:05:17.126
across to the left
hand side of the ket.

01:05:17.126 --> 01:05:19.740
BARTON ZWIEBACH: Yeah,
you're saying it, indeed.

01:05:19.740 --> 01:05:23.240
Look, this thing is
as simple as can be.

01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:25.660
This is just 1.

01:05:25.660 --> 01:05:27.580
Why is that so?

01:05:27.580 --> 01:05:32.320
You expand the exponential,
and you have 1 plus things,

01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:34.580
but all the things
have a daggers.

01:05:34.580 --> 01:05:36.960
Now, a daggers
don't kill this 1,

01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:39.440
but they killed the
other 1 on the left,

01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:43.380
and there's nothing obstructing
them from reaching the left,

01:05:43.380 --> 01:05:46.810
so this is 1.

01:05:46.810 --> 01:05:48.960
It's completely
different from this one

01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:52.790
because if you expand this one,
the a daggers kill the thing

01:05:52.790 --> 01:05:55.780
but there's lots
of a's to the left.

01:05:55.780 --> 01:05:57.770
And the a's want to
get here, but there's

01:05:57.770 --> 01:06:00.980
lots of a daggers to the
right, so this is hard,

01:06:00.980 --> 01:06:02.170
but this is easy.

01:06:02.170 --> 01:06:12.880
So n of gamma is 0 2 0 1.

01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:15.060
But what is that?

01:06:15.060 --> 01:06:20.300
If you introduce a complete
set of position states, zx,

01:06:20.300 --> 01:06:29.040
This is 0 2 x x 0 1.

01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:38.050
This one is the ground
state wave function

01:06:38.050 --> 01:06:41.980
of the first
Hamiltonian, and this

01:06:41.980 --> 01:06:44.330
is the start of the
ground state wave

01:06:44.330 --> 01:06:47.280
function of the
second Hamiltonian.

01:06:52.580 --> 01:06:56.082
And those you know
because you know m, omega.

01:06:56.082 --> 01:06:57.790
You know the ground
state wave functions,

01:06:57.790 --> 01:06:59.570
so this integral can be done.

01:06:59.570 --> 01:07:04.510
So this whole normalization
is given by this integral,

01:07:04.510 --> 01:07:11.370
and this integral gives you 1
over square root of cosh gamma.

01:07:11.370 --> 01:07:13.900
That interval takes
a few lines to make,

01:07:13.900 --> 01:07:17.115
but the end result is there.

01:07:19.670 --> 01:07:22.540
So you got your coherent states.

01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:32.340
You got now the squeezed
state completely normalized,

01:07:32.340 --> 01:07:34.550
so let's write it out.

01:07:34.550 --> 01:07:44.690
0 1 is equal to 1 over square
root of cosh gamma exponential

01:07:44.690 --> 01:07:55.710
of minus 1/2 tanh gamma a2
dagger a2 dagger on the vacuum

01:07:55.710 --> 01:07:56.400
sub 2.

01:08:00.030 --> 01:08:00.730
Wow.

01:08:00.730 --> 01:08:01.650
That's it.

01:08:01.650 --> 01:08:07.300
That's a squeeze state that
has been squeezed in such a way

01:08:07.300 --> 01:08:10.570
that the squeezing
parameter appears here

01:08:10.570 --> 01:08:13.660
in the exponential.

01:08:13.660 --> 01:08:15.710
Now, this is the
way we got to it,

01:08:15.710 --> 01:08:20.359
but now I wanted to just think
of it independently, just

01:08:20.359 --> 01:08:21.319
from the beginning.

01:08:21.319 --> 01:08:29.120
If you had a Hamiltonian,
this is an interesting state

01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:33.910
all in itself because
it is a squeezed state.

01:08:33.910 --> 01:08:39.850
It's a Gaussian, but of the
wrong shape for this system.

01:08:39.850 --> 01:08:43.770
This is a Gaussian of the
right shape for system two.

01:08:43.770 --> 01:08:45.830
But once you put all
these oscillators,

01:08:45.830 --> 01:08:49.350
it's not anymore a
Gaussian of the right type.

01:08:49.350 --> 01:08:51.439
It's a squeezed Gaussian.

01:08:51.439 --> 01:08:55.430
So if we forget about
this system one,

01:08:55.430 --> 01:09:00.229
let me write this thing from
the beginning and say like this.

01:09:00.229 --> 01:09:04.710
We have a Hamiltonian,
we have a ground state,

01:09:04.710 --> 01:09:12.240
we have m and omega, and
we have a and a dagger.

01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:19.380
Let's just define what we call
the squeezed vacuum, vacuum sub

01:09:19.380 --> 01:09:23.470
gamma, to be
precisely this thing.

01:09:23.470 --> 01:09:31.380
1 over square root of cosh
gamma exponential of minus 1/2

01:09:31.380 --> 01:09:39.620
tanh gamma a dagger
a dagger, not 2

01:09:39.620 --> 01:09:43.670
anymore because we have
just a single system.

01:09:43.670 --> 01:09:47.100
A single system, the
ground state, and now we've

01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:51.359
defined this state, which
is what we had there before,

01:09:51.359 --> 01:09:53.790
but we don't think of
it anymore as, oh, it

01:09:53.790 --> 01:09:55.770
came from some
other Hamiltonian,

01:09:55.770 --> 01:09:59.650
but rather, this is
a state on its own.

01:09:59.650 --> 01:10:03.060
It's a squeezed vacuum state.

01:10:03.060 --> 01:10:08.220
And from the computations
that we did here,

01:10:08.220 --> 01:10:14.340
the delta x for this state would
be e to the minus gamma h bar m

01:10:14.340 --> 01:10:15.850
omega.

01:10:15.850 --> 01:10:21.810
and m omega over here.

01:10:21.810 --> 01:10:25.940
So these are these,
and you don't

01:10:25.940 --> 01:10:27.860
need to know what gamma is.

01:10:27.860 --> 01:10:31.320
That's a number that
somebody chose for you.

01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:34.730
Any number that
you want is gamma,

01:10:34.730 --> 01:10:38.230
and therefore, you use
it to squeeze the state.

01:10:38.230 --> 01:10:40.280
And that's what you've achieved.

01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:43.720
So you have a Hamiltonian
of a harmonic oscillator.

01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:45.690
You can construct the vacuum.

01:10:45.690 --> 01:10:48.030
You know how to
construct coherent states

01:10:48.030 --> 01:10:49.740
by acting on the vacuum.

01:10:49.740 --> 01:10:53.430
Now you know how to construct
squeezed states, states

01:10:53.430 --> 01:10:56.170
in which the expectation
values do those things.

01:11:01.350 --> 01:11:06.000
We had a very nice formula
where we began the lecture today

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:14.110
in which the coherent
state was just

01:11:14.110 --> 01:11:18.080
a unitary operator
acting on the vacuum.

01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:21.340
Now, we made sure
to normalize this,

01:11:21.340 --> 01:11:24.760
so we did check in
this calculation

01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:30.450
that o gamma 0
gamma is equal to 1.

01:11:30.450 --> 01:11:35.830
So this thing must
come from the action

01:11:35.830 --> 01:11:41.080
of some unitary operator
acting on the vacuum.

01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:46.420
Which is that unitary operator
that acts on the vacuum

01:11:46.420 --> 01:11:49.250
and gives you that?

01:11:49.250 --> 01:11:51.075
Not so easy to find.

01:11:51.075 --> 01:11:53.470
All the computations here
are a little challenging,

01:11:53.470 --> 01:11:54.750
as you've seen.

01:11:54.750 --> 01:11:58.570
But here's the answer.

01:11:58.570 --> 01:12:09.300
Cosh gamma e to the exponential
of minus 1/2 tanh gamma

01:12:09.300 --> 01:12:14.380
a dagger a dagger
should be something

01:12:14.380 --> 01:12:19.820
like an e to the what?

01:12:19.820 --> 01:12:23.630
Should be something
like e to the a dagger

01:12:23.630 --> 01:12:30.290
a dagger minus aa
acting on the vacuum.

01:12:30.290 --> 01:12:31.260
Why?

01:12:31.260 --> 01:12:36.280
Because certainly, the aa's
are going to disappear,

01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:41.820
and you're going to get
products of this one squared.

01:12:41.820 --> 01:12:48.010
And this is anti-Hermitian,
so that operator is unitary,

01:12:48.010 --> 01:12:52.510
but I now must put the
gamma somewhere there.

01:12:52.510 --> 01:12:58.635
So what should I put here in
order to get that to work?

01:13:06.710 --> 01:13:11.790
Well, it's maybe
something you can

01:13:11.790 --> 01:13:17.700
try by assuming gamma is very
small and expanding both sides,

01:13:17.700 --> 01:13:21.270
or finding a differential
equation, or doing things,

01:13:21.270 --> 01:13:25.930
but the answer is
incredibly simple.

01:13:25.930 --> 01:13:32.026
It's e to the minus
just gamma over 2.

01:13:32.026 --> 01:13:33.360
That's it.

01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:37.220
Gamma appears here,
and by the time

01:13:37.220 --> 01:13:41.730
you reorder this
quadratic form--

01:13:41.730 --> 01:13:46.090
you see, what you have
to do here is expand,

01:13:46.090 --> 01:13:47.830
and then you have
powers of these,

01:13:47.830 --> 01:13:51.300
and then you have to bring all
the annihilators to the right

01:13:51.300 --> 01:13:52.370
and kill them.

01:13:52.370 --> 01:13:56.330
And then you have a power
series in squares of this thing.

01:13:56.330 --> 01:13:59.780
That will reassemble
into this exponential.

01:13:59.780 --> 01:14:01.540
It's almost a miracle
that something

01:14:01.540 --> 01:14:07.120
like that could happen,
but it does happen.

01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:10.110
And it's a very interesting
calculation, actually,

01:14:10.110 --> 01:14:10.740
to do that.

01:14:10.740 --> 01:14:13.340
We don't do it in the course.

01:14:13.340 --> 01:14:16.770
I may post some pages that
I did once this computation.

01:14:20.260 --> 01:14:26.350
And that is a nice operator.

01:14:26.350 --> 01:14:29.056
We call it the
squeezing operator.

01:14:33.980 --> 01:14:40.120
So s of gamma is a unitary
operator, s of gamma.

01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:44.600
The squeezed state of
0 gamma is equal to s

01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:49.510
of gamma on the vacuum
where s of gamma

01:14:49.510 --> 01:14:54.560
is equal to e to the minus
gamma over 2 a dagger a dagger

01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:58.370
minus aa, that operator.

01:14:58.370 --> 01:15:02.585
It's a unitary operator
and it does the squeezing.

01:15:05.590 --> 01:15:14.660
Actually, once you have squeezed
states, you can do more things,

01:15:14.660 --> 01:15:18.330
and you can squeeze
and then translate.

01:15:18.330 --> 01:15:20.280
Those are the most
general states

01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:24.280
that people use
in quantum optics.

01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:31.830
So you take a vacuum, you
squeeze it with s of gamma,

01:15:31.830 --> 01:15:36.920
and then you translate
it with v of alpha.

01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:43.540
And this is the state,
alpha gamma, squeeze factor,

01:15:43.540 --> 01:15:46.090
translation factor.

01:15:46.090 --> 01:15:50.490
One picture of that
is in our alpha plane.

01:15:50.490 --> 01:15:54.680
You take the vacuum that
is some spherical ball here

01:15:54.680 --> 01:15:59.860
in the x expectation
value, p expectation value.

01:15:59.860 --> 01:16:00.980
You squeeze it.

01:16:00.980 --> 01:16:06.130
You might decide, I don't
want to have too much delta x,

01:16:06.130 --> 01:16:08.950
so you squeeze it and you
produce something like this.

01:16:13.530 --> 01:16:17.630
That's a squeezed vacuum
by the time you apply this.

01:16:17.630 --> 01:16:22.910
And then you do the alpha,
and you translate it out,

01:16:22.910 --> 01:16:25.140
and this state is now
going to start rotating

01:16:25.140 --> 01:16:28.781
and doing all kinds of motion.

01:16:28.781 --> 01:16:31.410
It's pretty practical stuff.

01:16:31.410 --> 01:16:37.050
Actually, some of you
are taking junior lab,

01:16:37.050 --> 01:16:40.320
and the person that works
a lot there in junior lab

01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:45.060
is Nergis Mavalvala, and she
does gravity wave detection,

01:16:45.060 --> 01:16:47.850
and squeezed states has
been exactly what she's

01:16:47.850 --> 01:16:49.350
been working.

01:16:49.350 --> 01:16:51.890
In order to minimize
displacements

01:16:51.890 --> 01:16:54.960
in the gravity wave
detectors, they

01:16:54.960 --> 01:16:59.200
have a squeeze vacuum state
injected into the detector

01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:02.950
to make the harmonic
oscillator that

01:17:02.950 --> 01:17:07.320
represents the mirror stabilize
its uncertainty in position

01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:09.400
to the maximum possible.

01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:11.570
There's a whole
fabulous technique

01:17:11.570 --> 01:17:14.770
that people use with
the squeezed states.

01:17:14.770 --> 01:17:16.350
Now, the squeezed
states allow you

01:17:16.350 --> 01:17:22.350
to construct some states that
seemed to us that they were

01:17:22.350 --> 01:17:27.710
pretty strange and that we never
had good formulas for them.

01:17:27.710 --> 01:17:30.040
So that's how I want to
conclude the lecture.

01:17:30.040 --> 01:17:34.290
I will leave photon
states for next time,

01:17:34.290 --> 01:17:37.470
but I want to discuss
one more application

01:17:37.470 --> 01:17:43.080
of the squeezed states,
and this comes from limits.

01:17:47.410 --> 01:17:54.740
So here is your squeezed
state, e to the minus gamma.

01:17:54.740 --> 01:17:59.110
So let's squeeze the
state to the end.

01:17:59.110 --> 01:18:01.066
Take gamma to go to infinity.

01:18:04.690 --> 01:18:06.730
What happens to
the squeezed state?

01:18:06.730 --> 01:18:11.420
So you're narrowing out the
ground state in position space

01:18:11.420 --> 01:18:13.310
to the maximum possible.

01:18:13.310 --> 01:18:15.420
What happens to the state?

01:18:15.420 --> 01:18:18.725
Well, it goes a little singular,
but not terribly singular.

01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:27.170
Gamma is going to
infinity, so cosh

01:18:27.170 --> 01:18:30.150
is going to infinity as well.

01:18:30.150 --> 01:18:36.230
So the state is going kind
of to 0, but 0 sub infinity.

01:18:36.230 --> 01:18:39.690
It's proportional, but
the exponential is good.

01:18:39.690 --> 01:18:45.480
Exponential of minus
1/2 tangent of gamma

01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:49.850
as gamma goes to
infinity is just 1.

01:18:49.850 --> 01:18:58.540
And this is a dagger a
dagger on the vacuum.

01:18:58.540 --> 01:19:04.135
This state is in almost
terrible danger to be infinite.

01:19:04.135 --> 01:19:07.260
If you try to find
its wave function,

01:19:07.260 --> 01:19:09.560
you're not going to be
able to normalize it.

01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:11.890
You've reached the
end of the road

01:19:11.890 --> 01:19:15.340
kind of thing because of this.

01:19:15.340 --> 01:19:16.900
Gamma goes to infinity.

01:19:16.900 --> 01:19:19.440
This is going to
be infinite here

01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:21.270
because this state,
if you compute

01:19:21.270 --> 01:19:24.650
its overlap with
itself, is blowing up.

01:19:24.650 --> 01:19:26.670
And here, you see
the niceness of this.

01:19:26.670 --> 01:19:30.000
It also suggests that gamma
can go from plus infinity

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:33.310
to minus infinity, and
that's a natural thing.

01:19:33.310 --> 01:19:37.630
Nevertheless, here, it goes
from plus 1 to minus 1.

01:19:37.630 --> 01:19:40.900
If you had a number 3
here, this is a state

01:19:40.900 --> 01:19:43.600
that blows much worse
than the worst delta

01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:47.570
function or derivative or
square that you've ever had.

01:19:47.570 --> 01:19:51.290
It's just unbelievably
divergent because it just

01:19:51.290 --> 01:19:53.160
can't exist, this state.

01:19:53.160 --> 01:19:58.100
You're going beyond infinity
here to go behind this thing.

01:19:58.100 --> 01:20:00.430
So it's just pretty
much impossible.

01:20:00.430 --> 01:20:03.250
So the limit is
states are reasonable

01:20:03.250 --> 01:20:07.400
as long as this quadratic
form goes from minus 1 to 1.

01:20:07.400 --> 01:20:11.660
And when you go to 1, you get
this, and what should this be?

01:20:11.660 --> 01:20:14.940
This should be the
wave function I

01:20:14.940 --> 01:20:17.240
associated to a delta function.

01:20:17.240 --> 01:20:24.490
This would be the position
state, x equals 0.

01:20:24.490 --> 01:20:27.250
Roughly, it's a delta function.

01:20:27.250 --> 01:20:31.040
And indeed, if you
act with x on it,

01:20:31.040 --> 01:20:33.620
x, remember, is a plus a dagger.

01:20:37.640 --> 01:20:38.750
Act on this exponential.

01:20:42.330 --> 01:20:45.180
Now, do you remember
how to do that?

01:20:45.180 --> 01:20:50.330
This a dagger doesn't do
anything but the a goes here,

01:20:50.330 --> 01:20:52.060
and it's a trivial commutator.

01:20:52.060 --> 01:20:55.400
You get minus a dagger.

01:20:55.400 --> 01:20:58.800
So it actually kills
this and gives you 0.

01:20:58.800 --> 01:21:03.455
So in fact, the exposition
operator acting on here

01:21:03.455 --> 01:21:06.690
gives you 0.

01:21:06.690 --> 01:21:11.590
It looks like it is really
the state x equals 0.

01:21:11.590 --> 01:21:17.210
If you go the other way
around, and you take gamma

01:21:17.210 --> 01:21:23.380
to be minus infinity, the
only thing that changes here

01:21:23.380 --> 01:21:24.110
is the sign.

01:21:24.110 --> 01:21:32.430
So this is like the delta of
x, or the x equals 0 state.

01:21:32.430 --> 01:21:40.410
And if you take 0 minus
infinity, goes like x minus 1/2

01:21:40.410 --> 01:21:47.510
plus 1/2 a dagger a
dagger on the vacuum.

01:21:47.510 --> 01:21:51.430
And this state is a delta
function in momentum.

01:21:51.430 --> 01:21:55.950
It's the momentum
state p equals 0.

01:21:55.950 --> 01:21:57.210
Why?

01:21:57.210 --> 01:22:01.560
Because gamma is going
to minus infinity.

01:22:01.560 --> 01:22:05.380
The uncertainty of
momentum is going to 0.

01:22:05.380 --> 01:22:09.220
And therefore, indeed, if
you act with the momentum

01:22:09.220 --> 01:22:11.570
operator on this
state, it's like acting

01:22:11.570 --> 01:22:15.130
with a minus a
dagger, and you've

01:22:15.130 --> 01:22:18.160
changed the sign of this, but
you've changed the sign here,

01:22:18.160 --> 01:22:20.950
so it also kills this state.

01:22:20.950 --> 01:22:26.240
So it looks like we can really
construct position and momentum

01:22:26.240 --> 01:22:29.000
eigenstates now with
squeezed states,

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.200
and that's what they
are supposed to be.

01:22:31.200 --> 01:22:34.690
A squeezed state is something
that has been squeezed enough

01:22:34.690 --> 01:22:37.060
that you can get
a delta function.

01:22:37.060 --> 01:22:39.490
So how do you finish
that construction?

01:22:39.490 --> 01:22:40.240
Here is the claim.

01:22:43.860 --> 01:22:53.390
Square root of 2 m omega over
h bar x a dagger minus 1/2

01:22:53.390 --> 01:22:59.240
a dagger a dagger
acting on the vacuum.

01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:03.770
This is the claim, that this
is the x position state.

01:23:03.770 --> 01:23:08.150
So basically, you have
to squeeze first and then

01:23:08.150 --> 01:23:13.420
translate this thing
to the exposition.

01:23:13.420 --> 01:23:16.180
So how do you check this?

01:23:16.180 --> 01:23:19.320
Well, you should check
that the x operator, which

01:23:19.320 --> 01:23:27.440
is something times a plus a
dagger acting on this thing

01:23:27.440 --> 01:23:29.420
gives you little x.

01:23:29.420 --> 01:23:32.670
So you should have that
x operator on this thing

01:23:32.670 --> 01:23:35.910
gives you x x.

01:23:35.910 --> 01:23:39.720
And that is going to work out
because the a dagger is going

01:23:39.720 --> 01:23:42.616
to sit here and it's going
to get canceled with the a

01:23:42.616 --> 01:23:46.700
with this, but the
a with this part

01:23:46.700 --> 01:23:49.810
is just going to bring down
an x with the right factor.

01:23:49.810 --> 01:23:54.180
So this state, which is a
squeezed state and a little bit

01:23:54.180 --> 01:24:00.110
of a coherent state as well,
is producing the position

01:24:00.110 --> 01:24:01.830
eigenstate.

01:24:01.830 --> 01:24:04.100
In the harmonic
oscillator, you can really

01:24:04.100 --> 01:24:05.900
construct the
position eigenstate

01:24:05.900 --> 01:24:08.900
and you can calculate
the normalization.

01:24:08.900 --> 01:24:13.290
The normalization comes out
to be a rather simple thing.

01:24:13.290 --> 01:24:17.190
So at the end of the day,
the position eigenstate

01:24:17.190 --> 01:24:27.720
is m omega over pi h bar to the
1/4 e to the minus m omega x

01:24:27.720 --> 01:24:30.580
squared over 2h bar.

01:24:30.580 --> 01:24:33.570
And this whole
exponential, square root

01:24:33.570 --> 01:24:41.150
of 2 m omega over h bar,
x a dagger minus 1/2

01:24:41.150 --> 01:24:45.050
a dagger a dagger
acting on the vacuum.

01:24:50.850 --> 01:24:55.610
So your basis of creation
and annihilation operators

01:24:55.610 --> 01:24:58.930
on the harmonic oscillator
is flexible enough

01:24:58.930 --> 01:25:02.320
to allow for a concrete
description of your position

01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:06.470
eigenstates, and a
tractable one as well.

01:25:06.470 --> 01:25:16.320
And that's the extreme
limit of squeezing, together

01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:21.090
with some little bit of
coherent displacement.

01:25:21.090 --> 01:25:23.210
Next time, we'll do
our photon states

01:25:23.210 --> 01:25:25.790
and we'll illustrate the
ideas of both coherent

01:25:25.790 --> 01:25:28.620
and squeezed states
at the same time.
