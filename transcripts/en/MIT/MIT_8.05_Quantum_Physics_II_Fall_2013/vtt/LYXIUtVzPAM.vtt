00:00:21.152 --> 00:00:22.652
PROFESSOR: I'm going
to get started.

00:00:22.652 --> 00:00:27.520
And after a couple of minutes
there will be an announcement.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:33.700
So today's lecture
will begin by looking

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.370
at the singlet state
for a few minutes,

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:37.990
a couple of its properties.

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:43.370
And then we go into this
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:44.720
argument.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.810
We'll talk about
what they said, what

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:52.700
they wanted to criticize
quantum mechanics for.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.940
And then we'll go
through the answer

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.190
given by Bell that
actually demonstrated

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.510
that Einstein, Podolsky,
and Rosen were wrong.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.790
And after we'll do
those Bell inequalities,

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.990
we'll close this chapter
on quantum states of spins

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.600
and begin our treatment
of angular momentum.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.780
So I want to remind you
of a couple of things.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.740
We've been discussing this
so-called singlet state.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.720
Plus, minus.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:42.060
For the second particle,
minus minus, plus.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.340
First and second particle.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.955
This state.

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.870
A few things we've discovered
about this state--you've been

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:55.650
working with it.

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:01.160
We calculated its z-component
of total angular momentum,

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.200
the angular momentum
of the first particle

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.540
and the second particle.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:05.910
And it was 0.

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:07.760
The x-component was 0.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.990
This y-component is 0.

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.350
In fact it doesn't have
any total angular momentum.

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.250
So this state is rotationally
invariant, we say,

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.050
because it doesn't
have angular momentum.

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.750
You did very fine
in the homework

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.140
that the state is in fact
rotationally invariant.

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.660
Now this state is a
very interesting state.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.320
It's one of those
entangled states

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.140
that we discussed
last time when we

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.000
were talking about
teleportation and Bell states.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.870
And apart from
that, it's a state

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.380
that is not hard to
realize physically.

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.490
In fact, it typically
takes place, for example,

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.660
in reactions in decays
of certain particles.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.110
For example, pi 0 can
decay into two photons.

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.690
Then the two photos can be
in the state of total angular

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.370
momentum 0.

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.430
But more precisely, since we're
talking spin-1/2 particles,

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.090
if you have a meson
called an eta 0,

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:23.480
it's a interacting particle
of strong interactions.

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.890
A meson decays rather quickly
into a mu-plus plus a mu-minus.

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.080
Actually it decays into
other things as well.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.910
So it decays into two
spin-1/2 particles.

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.210
And this particle has
0 angular momentum.

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:42.190
It's a scalar.

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.540
It's not spinning.

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.780
And therefore, if
these two particles

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.670
go into a state of 0
orbital angular momentum,

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.220
conservation of angular
momentum implies

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.290
that these two particles are
in the state of this form that

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:05.660
has 0 spin angular momentum,
total spin angular momentum.

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.220
So the realization of an
entangled state like that

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.380
is fairly common
and fairly easy.

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.830
So you have a decay
of this form and you

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.540
get particles that are
entangled this way.

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:25.070
You showed that
this state actually

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:31.920
could be a written as one
over square root of 2, n-plus,

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:44.130
n-minus, 1, 2, minus
n-minus, n-plus, 1, 2.

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:48.060
Precisely because this
invariant and the rotations,

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:56.620
you could use instead of the
plus-minus basis, any basis n.

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.730
For any direction n,
you have this state.

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:06.540
Now we'll talk about
the probability

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.230
that is of interest to us.

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:16.410
We'll write to this symbol,
probability to get a plus,

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:20.410
say, b plus.

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:31.480
And this means that
probability to get particle--

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:40.860
let me see-- to find the
first particle-- particle

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:54.280
with spin along a so that
this first particle to be

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.830
in the state a plus.

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:09.890
And the second
particle-- particle

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:17.430
will spin along-- along b.

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:23.910
So in this state, b plus.

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:26.780
Now that looks--
this calculation

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:30.730
of this probability-- So you're
going to do some measurement.

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:32.300
And you ask, what
is the probability

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.620
I find the first particle in
this direction, second particle

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:38.900
pointing in this direction?

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:43.120
It may look like a somewhat
non-trivial calculation.

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.180
And it is.

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:47.730
But if you use the fact
this the state over

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:53.020
there-- because we're asking for
this probability on this state.

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:55.360
We're going to be
talking about this state.

00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:03.040
So if you put the state and you
write the state in the form,

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:06.070
you pick one of the
two vectors, say, a.

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:15.470
Well, the state is a-plus,
a-minus, 1, 2, minus a-minus,

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:16.750
a-plus.

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:20.600
Because I could choose
n to be anything.

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:26.400
So might this well choose one
of the two vectors to be a.

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:29.470
And then you ask what
is the probability

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:34.743
to find first
particle in this state

00:07:34.743 --> 00:07:37.320
and second particle
in this state?

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:40.210
Well, when somebody tells
you, what is the probability

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:42.520
to find a particle
in a state, you

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:46.810
put that state into--
you sandwich your psi

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:48.500
with that state.

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:53.080
And this overlap, which is
a number, you square it.

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:56.070
So we're going to do
the same thing here.

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:59.590
So what is this probability?

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:04.740
Probability to find
a plus, b plus,

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:06.820
would be the absolute value.

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:11.850
And then we put here a
plus in the first state.

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:16.550
Tensor product, we could say.

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:21.830
Well, b plus in
the second state.

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:24.960
And we should put-- because
this is what we want to find,

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:29.840
the state on the tensor
product that we're looking for.

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:31.890
And we put the psi here.

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:36.340
So we must put the 1 over
square root of 2 times

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:45.990
the a-plus 1, a-minus 2,
minus a-minus 1, a-plus 2.

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:56.210
So [? overlap ?] time, well,
we go 1 with 1, 2 with 2.

00:08:56.210 --> 00:09:01.150
So well, a-plus with
a-plus will give me 1.

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:04.110
b-plus with a-minus,
I don't know.

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:09.630
Second term, a-plus
with a-minus gives me 0.

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:12.170
So this term is irrelevant.

00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:14.280
I just need this.

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:19.310
So the a-plus with
the a-plus gives me 1.

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:23.120
I have the 1 over
square root of 2 here.

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:27.010
And I must close
this and square.

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:30.140
I forgot to write that.

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:32.410
So what is this probability?

00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:42.300
A-plus, b-plus is equal to-- the
1 over square root becomes 1/2.

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:49.660
And then all we have left
is b-plus with a-minus.

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:55.040
In the second state space, in
the particle 2 state space,

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:57.410
the label doesn't matter
at the end of the day

00:09:57.410 --> 00:10:00.570
now that we've
disentangled the 1 and 2.

00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:02.810
So it's b-plus a-minus.

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:04.970
I don't have to
write that it's 2, 2.

00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:06.760
Or you can write it.

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:08.220
And it's this squared.

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:16.380
So it's simplified a lot but
not quite yet the answer.

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:20.370
What we need here is the overlap
between these two spin states.

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:25.970
And I remind you that when
you had any arbitrary spin

00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:31.960
states with n and n prime,
long, long ago, homework three

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:34.520
or four, something like
that, you calculated

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:39.060
the overlap between
these two spin states.

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:40.990
And the answer
was that you would

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:44.192
take cosine of
1/2 of the angle--

00:10:44.192 --> 00:10:46.580
if there is an angle gamma.

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:53.010
The overlap between
the spin states

00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:57.280
squared was cosine
squared of 1/2 the angle.

00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:12.590
So here we have the vector
a, see, the vector b.

00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:20.195
Here is the vector
a-minus, a-minus direction.

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:30.680
And if we call this theta ab,
this is pi minus theta ab.

00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:34.490
So this should be
1/2 cos squared

00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:40.230
1/2 of pi minus theta ab.

00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:44.020
1/2 cosine square
of half of the angle

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:46.610
between the two
relevant vectors.

00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:50.670
So this is cosine of pi
over 2 minus theta over 2.

00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:57.750
That's sine squared
of theta ab over 2.

00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:58.840
So here it is.

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:06.120
It's our calculation
of this thing.

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:11.920
It's a neat formula that we're
going to need later today.

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:17.050
So one more comment
before a little stop,

00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:20.650
if b is equal to minus a.

00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:32.140
Now in that case you should
be in luck because precisely

00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:38.930
what's happening here
is that if one spin is

00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:40.890
along the plus
direction the other

00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:43.430
has to be along the minus
direction, whichever

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:44.220
you choose.

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:50.640
So in order to have that a
be in plus and b be in plus,

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:54.200
well, this first
term would do it.

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:57.350
a is in plus, the
first particle.

00:12:57.350 --> 00:12:59.550
Here, no.

00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:03.100
And b, which is minus
a, would be in plus.

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:05.120
So the probably should be 1/2.

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:16.590
So if b is minus a, the angle
theta ab is equal to pi.

00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:24.130
And the probability of
ab is 1/2, correctly.

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:33.510
And it's 1/2 because half
of the cases a is in plus.

00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:36.780
The other cases, a is in minus.

00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:40.730
So the other case, for example,
that could be interesting is,

00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:44.590
what is the probability
that the first particle is

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:51.115
in z-plus and the second
particle is in x-plus?

00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:58.770
Well, these two vectors
form 90 degrees.

00:13:58.770 --> 00:14:03.570
So you should have 1/2
of the sine of half that.

00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:14.740
So that should give you 1/2 of
the sine squared of pi over 4.

00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:22.050
And it's 1/2, then it's 1
over square root of 2, that's

00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:23.130
another 1/2.

00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:27.570
So it's one quarter,
for example.

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:30.440
OK, I went long
enough for a moment.

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:32.620
There's an announcement
that [? Preshanth ?] wants

00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:36.630
to make so please listen to him.

00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:41.820
[? PRESHANTH: Hi ?] I'm back
for another announcement.

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:45.930
So tonight, the MIT SPS
is going to be holding

00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:49.450
its fall UROP
lightning lectures.

00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:54.210
So if you don't have a UROP
it's a great opportunity for you

00:14:54.210 --> 00:14:59.440
to come and see what other
research your classmates are

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:01.320
doing in physics.

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:03.645
If you do have a UROP,
I would encourage

00:15:03.645 --> 00:15:06.820
you to come as well because
you can actually come and share

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:10.380
your stories about the
technical content of what

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:12.936
you're doing in your UROP.

00:15:12.936 --> 00:15:17.480
It's 7:30 this evening
in the PCR 8329.

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:21.110
There will be free food,
so please join us then.

00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:23.970
And see you all then.

00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:24.470
Thanks.

00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:25.345
PROFESSOR: Thank you.

00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:34.820
All right.

00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:41.460
So, this was the introduction
to what we really

00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:44.850
need to do today.

00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:49.640
So before we get started,
are there any questions

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:52.910
on what we've done so far?

00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:58.540
On these properties of
this entangled state?

00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:03.870
So this is a measurement
of an entangled state.

00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:07.320
These two particles could have
flown away a big distance.

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:11.660
Two observers, one tries to
see what is the probability.

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:15.080
The first observer
sees the spine

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:16.470
pointing in some direction.

00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:20.110
The other observer sees the spin
pointing in another direction.

00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:21.640
It's a the natural
question which

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:25.440
can be done experimentally.

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:28.325
And we've calculated
that answer.

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:41.156
Now so let's begin
with this EPR story.

00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:51.210
Now, you've seen some of
EPR last semester in 804.

00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:54.330
The only complication with
that is that you really

00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:59.290
needed to have these mathematics
to appreciate it completely.

00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:03.860
So this second
look at EPR should

00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:08.470
be fairly complete in that we
won't leave almost anything out

00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:09.910
of the story.

00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:15.520
There are many ways of doing
EPR and essentially these Bell

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:19.540
inequalities, which is the
really non-trivial thing that

00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:20.980
comes after that.

00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:25.230
So some are in the
homework, some elaborations.

00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:28.960
And probably in recitation
later in the course

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:31.700
we'll see a little more.

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:38.330
But it all begins with a
strange thing, the kind of thing

00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:42.420
that you wouldn't expect
people in physics to discuss.

00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:46.490
And it's the point
of this so-called--

00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:49.480
Einstein, Polosky, and
Rosen wrote a paper.

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:52.993
And they talked
about local realism.

00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:01.270
Now, that sounds
like philosophy.

00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:04.400
And for awhile people
thought, well, this

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:09.200
is interesting, but undecidable.

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:12.290
Can't really do
anything with it.

00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:13.973
So what is local realism?

00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:20.290
Now, again, not being
exactly physics,

00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:23.650
it's not all that easy
to say what it is.

00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:27.340
And people discussed that.

00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:31.570
But some notion of
it is fairly clear.

00:18:31.570 --> 00:18:37.480
The notion is that this reflects
something-- it's basically

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:50.165
two assumptions about
measurement results.

00:18:56.560 --> 00:19:04.130
So you measure something
and obtain a number.

00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:12.780
And the first assumption,
one, is that these measurement

00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:19.090
results correspond to
some aspects of reality.

00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:23.165
Just said like that it
seems a little funny.

00:19:23.165 --> 00:19:25.890
That you measure something,
if get some numbers,

00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:29.110
because that was something
real about this object,

00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:30.710
it had this property.

00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:37.100
And so measurement corresponds
to some aspect of reality.

00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:42.720
So measurements-- assumptions
about measurement results.

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:46.540
So measurements.

00:19:46.540 --> 00:20:01.783
m, correspond to some
aspect of reality.

00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:13.860
Two, the measurements that
you do in you lab are not

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:18.370
affected whatsoever
by the measurements

00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:23.970
that somebody else is doing
at the same time at the moon.

00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:26.340
There's no time
for the information

00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:31.960
of what that result in the
moon has given to reach you.

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:36.750
So at that instant of time,
what they are doing at the moon

00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:39.080
doesn't affect the result
of your experiment.

00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:51.380
So it's measurement is
independent of actions

00:20:51.380 --> 00:21:09.500
performed at a distant
location at the same time.

00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:18.770
Now to Einstein and Polosky
and Rosen-- but Einstein

00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:26.500
was very vocal-- Physics
must satisfy that.

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:29.730
It's kind of sad
I think, actually.

00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:36.640
The person that managed to see
through and discover how nature

00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:42.540
works at so many deep levels--
the photoelectric effect,

00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:45.920
special relatively,
general relativity--

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:50.530
somehow became convinced
that this had to be true.

00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:55.110
And unfortunately, he was wrong.

00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:56.900
Or fortunately, I guess.

00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:59.990
It's not worth trying
to qualify that.

00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:05.490
But these two things that
seem just so reasonable

00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:07.770
are just not true.

00:22:07.770 --> 00:22:10.610
This one, measurements
correspond

00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:14.640
to some aspect of
reality-- you see,

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:18.650
you have a Stern-Gerlach
apparatus, you throw a spin,

00:22:18.650 --> 00:22:20.330
it goes up.

00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:23.670
You say it ended
up with spin up.

00:22:23.670 --> 00:22:27.320
Well, Einstein would say
it always had spin up.

00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:32.090
It was a reality about that
object, at it had spin up.

00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:33.300
You just didn't know.

00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:37.850
You did the experiment
to you discovered it.

00:22:37.850 --> 00:22:43.600
So the thing that people
try to do in order

00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:46.920
to understand this concept,
that it corresponds to something

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:49.540
having to do with
the reality, is

00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:55.220
that you admit that
half of the particles

00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:58.350
go up and half go down.

00:22:58.350 --> 00:23:01.110
But you say, actually,
there's something

00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:03.080
about these particles
you don't know.

00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:08.450
And if you knew that, you
would just be able to tell.

00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:11.320
This is a particle
that has spin up.

00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:13.260
And it will go up.

00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:15.930
But in quantum mechanics,
we have abandoned that.

00:23:15.930 --> 00:23:19.650
We've said these particles here
are a superposition of a state

00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:21.270
up and a state down.

00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:25.070
And there's nothing definitely
up about this particle

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:27.670
or definitely down.

00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:32.800
So the way people do
this, to correspond

00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:35.530
to this aspect of reality
that you don't know,

00:23:35.530 --> 00:23:40.640
is by introducing what is
called hidden variables.

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:44.360
Some things that
allow you-- there's

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:50.710
something hidden about this spin
particle that you don't know.

00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:54.670
But if you knew it you
would know exactly how

00:23:54.670 --> 00:23:59.970
it's going to come out through
this Stern-Gerlach experiment.

00:23:59.970 --> 00:24:02.560
And you say, well, that
sounds fairly untestable.

00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:04.310
But the fact is that it's not.

00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:09.100
Now, so this is
implemented, this assumption

00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:12.080
is-- when people try to
modify quantum mechanics,

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:14.450
they use what is called
hidden variables.

00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:17.630
Some things that you don't
know about the particle,

00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:21.700
but if you knew, you would
see that in fact this particle

00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:23.510
has spin up.

00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:31.190
This second is in some ways even
more disturbing because we got

00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:34.430
accustomed to the
idea that, locally,

00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:38.580
simultaneous things
that cannot be reached--

00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:42.500
events that cannot talk to each
other via the exchange of light

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:43.800
cannot effect each other.

00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:46.810
So simultaneous things
that's happened far away

00:24:46.810 --> 00:24:48.150
can't effect each other.

00:24:48.150 --> 00:24:51.830
So this also sounds
very reasonable.

00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:53.235
But that's also wrong.

00:24:56.250 --> 00:24:59.470
And there's the obvious
question, so if this is wrong,

00:24:59.470 --> 00:25:04.230
can you send information
faster than the speed of light?

00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:08.200
And people looked at
it in many, many ways.

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:09.840
And it's very interesting.

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:11.420
And we could discuss that.

00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:14.330
But it would take us
long, so I will leave it

00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:18.250
to, maybe, the recitations,
maybe other forums.

00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:22.810
But here, actually,
there's no contradiction,

00:25:22.810 --> 00:25:28.960
no way of finding real
information going faster

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:31.720
than the speed of light,
even though things

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:35.310
far away at the same
time can affect you.

00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:38.820
So two very
interesting things that

00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:44.570
seemed very dangerous to discard
but turned out to be wrong.

00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:48.920
So this is what EPR did.

00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:52.740
And they made some
thought experiments

00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:55.250
that we're going to
review to some degree

00:25:55.250 --> 00:26:00.150
and see if we can discard
these assumptions.

00:26:00.150 --> 00:26:03.520
So that's what we're
going to do now.

00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:05.120
We're going to try
to understand that.

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:09.200
Now, if you're interested in
what hidden variables are,

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:13.080
my discussion will not
use hidden variables.

00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:15.160
Although they are
kind of implicit,

00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:18.390
you will see, as I
state some things.

00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:21.530
I'm basically going to be
explicit on the fact that

00:26:21.530 --> 00:26:25.450
things, [? the ?] [? real ?]
[? facts, ?] as Einstein would

00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:27.970
like you to think.

00:26:27.970 --> 00:26:34.580
And we'll try to see if those
real qualities about particles

00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:37.070
get us in trouble.

00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:45.520
So let's begin and try to
discuss this first experiment.

00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:52.870
You see observer one, Alice
and Bob again, if you want.

00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:56.210
Alice is going to
measure about the z-axis.

00:26:56.210 --> 00:26:59.380
Bob is going to measure
about the z-axis.

00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:08.440
And therefore, if Alice finds
spin up, Bob finds spin down.

00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:13.610
If Alice finds spin
down, Bob finds spin up.

00:27:13.610 --> 00:27:15.900
And that's a correlation.

00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:18.980
And it's very interesting.

00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:23.110
But Einstein, Bell, and
Polosky would say, look,

00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:25.740
it's not all that interesting.

00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:31.170
There's nothing all that
mysterious happening here.

00:27:31.170 --> 00:27:41.300
EPR would says, the
pairs that you've built,

00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:44.410
the so-called
entangled pairs, are

00:27:44.410 --> 00:28:00.680
pairs of particles with
definite spins-- spin

00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:02.330
directions, spin vectors.

00:28:02.330 --> 00:28:06.170
So what you have
built, EPR would say,

00:28:06.170 --> 00:28:14.800
if you have here particle
1 and particle 2--

00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:16.480
I'm going to list
the properties.

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:21.176
Suppose you have a
particle 1, you've created.

00:28:21.176 --> 00:28:24.750
Einstein would say
some particle 1s

00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:30.360
with spin up in z and particle
2 with spin down in z.

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:35.970
Or you've created particles
1 with spin down in z

00:28:35.970 --> 00:28:39.400
and particle 2
with spin up in z.

00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:43.810
And you've created [INAUDIBLE]
50% of the particles

00:28:43.810 --> 00:28:46.150
are of this type, of the pairs.

00:28:46.150 --> 00:28:50.340
And 50% of the pairs
are of this kind.

00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:56.706
So don't tell me all this
superposition hocus pocus.

00:28:56.706 --> 00:29:00.220
Half of your pairs, one
particle has spin up,

00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:02.420
one particle has spin down.

00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:09.410
The other 50% of your
pairs, particle one is down,

00:29:09.410 --> 00:29:12.300
the other particle is up.

00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:15.706
No wonder they're correlated.

00:29:15.706 --> 00:29:17.870
You get plus, gets minus.

00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:19.580
Get minus, get plus.

00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:22.170
What is the probability
that you get plus?

00:29:22.170 --> 00:29:23.060
50%.

00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:24.700
What is the probability
you get minus?

00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:26.170
50%.

00:29:26.170 --> 00:29:28.100
Everything is reproduced.

00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:29.340
Mystery over.

00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:31.543
No quantum superpositions.

00:29:35.092 --> 00:29:35.592
OK?

00:29:38.490 --> 00:29:40.870
There's no mistake here.

00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:45.210
No mathematical mistake.

00:29:45.210 --> 00:29:48.120
You're saying that the
particle has a definite spin.

00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:49.710
You maybe not know it.

00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:52.150
But we say, look,
your particles in fact

00:29:52.150 --> 00:29:57.050
have a definite spin, z-plus
and z-minus and those things.

00:29:57.050 --> 00:30:02.560
And this is where hidden
variables would come along.

00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:07.890
You would say, well, if you
have the particle 1, it's spin

00:30:07.890 --> 00:30:11.210
is a function of some hidden
variable that you don't know.

00:30:11.210 --> 00:30:12.710
But if you knew
it, you would know

00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:17.180
what the spin is because
it has a definite spin.

00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:19.760
You don't know what is
the hidden variable.

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:22.150
But as a function of
the hidden variable

00:30:22.150 --> 00:30:26.120
the spin is known, definite,
not a superposition,

00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:28.120
nothing like that.

00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:33.960
It's a very aggressive
attack on quantum mechanics

00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:36.780
and something that
troubled people.

00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:40.220
And in fact fascinates
people even up to now

00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:43.350
because the idea,
these kind of things

00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:45.740
are really absolutely wrong.

00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:48.460
It's very shocking.

00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:53.800
Perhaps the second even more
shocking because, by now

00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:57.590
may be you're accustomed
to all kinds of variables

00:30:57.590 --> 00:31:00.310
that are a little more
detached from reality.

00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:03.010
You have electromagnetic fields.

00:31:03.010 --> 00:31:05.670
And they forced you to
learn about potentials

00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:09.450
that seem to be a
little more abstract.

00:31:09.450 --> 00:31:11.530
And similarly here.

00:31:11.530 --> 00:31:16.550
So no problem at all.

00:31:16.550 --> 00:31:20.980
So people say, OK, this
is a simple situation.

00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:25.900
But it may be that we're
going to do more measurements.

00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:29.605
And we're going to consider two
directions that are different.

00:31:32.306 --> 00:31:39.180
Maybe Alice has two
Stern-Gerlach machines,

00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:43.130
one that measures about z
and one the measures about x.

00:31:43.130 --> 00:31:46.210
And Bob has also to
Stern-Gerlach machines,

00:31:46.210 --> 00:31:49.720
one of the measures about z
and one that measures about x.

00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:54.340
And they are going to
ask different questions.

00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:57.290
Because we know the
spin, how it transforms.

00:31:57.290 --> 00:32:00.180
So getting those results
right with two directions

00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:02.760
is going to be a little
more interesting.

00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:07.410
So we're going to try measuring
in two possible directions.

00:32:07.410 --> 00:32:23.420
Both A and B, Alice and Bob,
can measure in two directions, z

00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:26.310
and x.

00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:30.965
And Einstein would say, look,
you can measure in z and in x.

00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:38.160
To avoid confusion, let's not
talk about one measurement

00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:39.100
after another.

00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:44.810
Particle comes, you measure
in z or you measure in x.

00:32:44.810 --> 00:32:48.670
And realism says
that you don't know

00:32:48.670 --> 00:32:52.000
what you will get because maybe
there are hidden variables.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.940
But each particle
has a definite answer

00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:59.790
if you ask what is the
z direction of the spin

00:32:59.790 --> 00:33:03.800
and has a definite
answer if you ask

00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:07.400
what is the x-component
of the spin.

00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:11.540
Definite answers, real
answers, realism again.

00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:14.360
So I'm going to
label the particles.

00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:26.800
For example, this is a label
for a particle z-plus, x-minus.

00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:33.100
This particle labeled
like that would be such

00:33:33.100 --> 00:33:38.740
that if you measure its spin
in the z direction, it's plus.

00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:43.890
If you measure the spin in
the x direction, it's minus.

00:33:43.890 --> 00:33:57.030
So measured in z, it is up.

00:33:57.030 --> 00:34:02.900
Measured in x, it is down.

00:34:07.290 --> 00:34:11.885
These are the kind of particles
that EPR would say exist.

00:34:14.830 --> 00:34:18.090
It's not that you
got a particle out

00:34:18.090 --> 00:34:22.020
and it's in some
strange entangled state.

00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:24.630
These particles are flying away.

00:34:24.630 --> 00:34:27.030
They're not talking
to each other anymore.

00:34:27.030 --> 00:34:31.120
And this particle, since you
can measure in two directions,

00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:33.530
there's some reality,
and the measurements

00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:36.250
correspond to reality,
so there are attributes.

00:34:36.250 --> 00:34:40.449
And this particle is classified
by having these attributes.

00:34:40.449 --> 00:34:42.389
If you measure z, plus.

00:34:42.389 --> 00:34:46.409
If you measure x, minus.

00:34:46.409 --> 00:34:52.380
So how about this situation.

00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:54.429
Well, let me make a list now.

00:34:54.429 --> 00:35:00.090
Particles 1 and particle 2.

00:35:00.090 --> 00:35:03.540
And this would be the list
that EPR would do for you.

00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:10.630
EPR comes along and says,
look, here's what you're doing.

00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:16.540
Particle 1, suppose
it's a z-plus, x-plus.

00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:22.940
Well, in your beams, actually,
when particle 1 is that,

00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:29.810
your other particles
are z-minus, x-minus.

00:35:29.810 --> 00:35:32.410
So if particle 1
is of this type,

00:35:32.410 --> 00:35:34.130
particle 2 is of this type.

00:35:34.130 --> 00:35:41.790
That way, EPR protect themselves
because they say, look,

00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:45.110
if you measure z-plus
and you measure z-minus,

00:35:45.110 --> 00:35:46.450
you get correlation.

00:35:46.450 --> 00:35:51.240
If you get plus and plus,
you get correlation as well.

00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:57.150
Now there can be particles
in z-plus, x-minus.

00:35:57.150 --> 00:36:01.150
This will go with
a z-minus, x-plus.

00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:05.385
There could be a
particle z-minus, x-plus,

00:36:05.385 --> 00:36:10.270
and this as z-plus, x-minus.

00:36:10.270 --> 00:36:15.940
And there could be
particle z-minus, x-minus,

00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:19.200
z-plus, x-plus.

00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:21.730
So there are four
cases, four types

00:36:21.730 --> 00:36:26.610
of particles they say
have been produced.

00:36:26.610 --> 00:36:32.630
And 25% of pairs
are of this form.

00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:38.400
25% of pairs are of this,
25 of this, and 25 of this.

00:36:44.750 --> 00:36:47.990
So you could ask some
questions to EPR.

00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:56.760
What is the probability
that you get z-plus for 1

00:36:56.760 --> 00:37:01.770
and z-minus on 2.

00:37:01.770 --> 00:37:07.502
Well, z-plus on 1,
it's these two cases.

00:37:07.502 --> 00:37:11.860
And z-minus on 2,
well, those two cases.

00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:14.955
So this is 50% of the times.

00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:20.740
So it's 1/2 that probability.

00:37:20.740 --> 00:37:22.250
It's correct.

00:37:22.250 --> 00:37:26.650
That's what we would predict
from an entangled state

00:37:26.650 --> 00:37:28.350
viewpoint.

00:37:28.350 --> 00:37:30.770
But let's ask something mixed.

00:37:30.770 --> 00:37:32.500
Let's see if we get in trouble.

00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:42.925
P of z-plus on 1, and
let's say x-plus on 2.

00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:53.070
Well, z-plus on 1 and
x-plus on 2, that's not it.

00:37:53.070 --> 00:37:54.130
This case.

00:37:54.130 --> 00:37:58.830
z-plus on one, x-plus on 2.

00:37:58.830 --> 00:38:02.330
25% of the times, one 1/4.

00:38:05.450 --> 00:38:07.490
This was the probability
we calculated.

00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:13.365
So you tried with one direction.

00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:20.240
You don't need quantum
mechanics to produce a result.

00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:24.440
You try with two directions,
you don't need quantum mechanics

00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:27.820
to get the result.

00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:33.020
So people got stuck and
they said, well, maybe it's

00:38:33.020 --> 00:38:33.960
undecidable.

00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:35.810
Maybe this is philosophy.

00:38:35.810 --> 00:38:37.780
Maybe this is something.

00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:40.820
And people had to wait for Bell.

00:38:40.820 --> 00:38:44.340
He said I'm going to
try three directions.

00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:48.600
Now, three directions
makes a big difference.

00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:51.910
This is the first time
it really goes wrong.

00:38:51.910 --> 00:38:57.590
So it's kind of surprising,
perhaps, at some level.

00:38:57.590 --> 00:39:00.850
But this is subtle stuff.

00:39:00.850 --> 00:39:04.770
So it takes a while before
you find something wrong.

00:39:04.770 --> 00:39:08.520
You're talking about
showing Einstein it's wrong,

00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:09.745
so that's not so easy.

00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:16.305
So three directions.

00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:31.450
So particles are going to be
of types-- EPR would say, look,

00:39:31.450 --> 00:39:34.180
I'm going to use
the same strategy.

00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:38.330
I'm going to say that particles
have three attributes now.

00:39:38.330 --> 00:39:39.385
They're all physical.

00:39:39.385 --> 00:39:41.160
They correspond to reality.

00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:44.400
Because if you measure in
either of three directions,

00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:47.120
they have to have
an answer for that.

00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:49.650
So here's a label
for a particle.

00:39:55.688 --> 00:40:02.240
And for example,
a-plus, b-minus, c-plus.

00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:07.100
So if you measure, it would
give spin in a direction

00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:09.440
plus h bar over 2.

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:14.530
Spin in the b direction minus--
well, in the b direction

00:40:14.530 --> 00:40:17.190
would give you
minus h bar over 2.

00:40:17.190 --> 00:40:22.880
Spin in the c direction would
give you plus h bar over 2 .

00:40:25.850 --> 00:40:28.710
So we're not measuring
simultaneously.

00:40:28.710 --> 00:40:31.690
We're just asking, well,
you take a particle,

00:40:31.690 --> 00:40:33.850
do a measurement,
and see what you get.

00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:40.440
And we're always going to
be asking for probabilities

00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:44.380
of this kind, probably that the
first particle is doing this

00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:47.980
and the second is doing that.

00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:53.080
Well, EPR would start
now with particles

00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:58.403
again, particle 1, particle 2.

00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:03.120
And populations.

00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:05.400
So let's list quickly
the particles.

00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:09.040
a-plus, b-plus, c-plus.

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:15.970
Then you will go
a-plus, b-plus, c-minus.

00:41:15.970 --> 00:41:18.540
Then you've done the
c-plus, c-minus here.

00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:20.770
You go for two more.

00:41:20.770 --> 00:41:25.900
A-plus, b-minus, c-plus.

00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:28.750
a-plus, b-minus, c-minus.

00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:37.450
I was supposed to
fit four more there.

00:41:37.450 --> 00:41:38.240
Can I?

00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:41.210
Well, I will try. a-minus.

00:41:41.210 --> 00:41:43.306
Now you've done all
the four a-pluses

00:41:43.306 --> 00:41:44.430
so you need four a-minuses.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:57.810
Then you have b-plus, b-plus,
b-minus, b-minus, c-plus,

00:41:57.810 --> 00:42:01.100
c-minus, c-plus, c-minus.

00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:02.545
I got all, I think.

00:42:05.350 --> 00:42:08.480
And particle two of
course is correlated.

00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:10.800
You would say, well, I
don't need to write it.

00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:15.800
But it helps seeing what's going
on so I'll write it. a-minus,

00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:21.980
b-minus, c-minus,
a-minus, b-minus,

00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:29.810
c-plus, a-minus-- let's use
bars here-- a-minus, b-plus,

00:42:29.810 --> 00:42:38.410
c-minus, a-minus, b-plus,
c-plus, a-plus, b-minus,

00:42:38.410 --> 00:42:47.430
c-minus, a-plus, b-minus,
c-plus, a-plus, b-plus,

00:42:47.430 --> 00:42:54.730
c-minus, a-plus, b-minus,
c-- this one is minus

00:42:54.730 --> 00:42:56.750
so it's plus here.

00:42:56.750 --> 00:42:58.080
We're done.

00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:01.560
Lots of labels.

00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:03.860
And you could say,
well, maybe you

00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:06.710
want to put 1/8 in each of them.

00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:09.290
But actually the argument
is more interesting.

00:43:09.290 --> 00:43:13.700
It doesn't need you have
to try to put fractions.

00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:18.020
So let's consider that there's
a total number of particles

00:43:18.020 --> 00:43:24.030
N, which is N1 plus up to N8.

00:43:24.030 --> 00:43:29.370
And here are N1 of this,
N2 of this, N3 of this,

00:43:29.370 --> 00:43:35.670
N4 of this, N5, N6, N7, and N8.

00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:46.444
Let's see how--

00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:51.640
All right, so we have that.

00:43:55.050 --> 00:43:57.700
Well, it takes
imagination to see

00:43:57.700 --> 00:44:03.370
how you're going to run
into some contradiction.

00:44:03.370 --> 00:44:05.930
So what is the basis
for the contradiction?

00:44:05.930 --> 00:44:12.840
Somehow this formula, which
is really quantum mechanical

00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:17.820
must eventually go wrong
with all these attempts

00:44:17.820 --> 00:44:21.090
to deny that the world
is quantum mechanical.

00:44:21.090 --> 00:44:27.870
So we could split again those
particles into equal fractions.

00:44:27.870 --> 00:44:29.710
But there's no need to do that.

00:44:29.710 --> 00:44:31.950
And it's clearer if you don't.

00:44:31.950 --> 00:44:36.710
So you try to combine the three
directions into one equation.

00:44:36.710 --> 00:44:40.150
So one way to do that
would be to say, OK,

00:44:40.150 --> 00:44:44.830
what is the probability that
you get a-plus and b-plus?

00:44:44.830 --> 00:44:47.700
So this is for the
particle number 1.

00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:50.180
And this is particle number 2.

00:44:50.180 --> 00:44:53.810
So then you must
look at the table

00:44:53.810 --> 00:44:56.000
and say which one's do that.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:57.930
Well, you need
a-plus in the first

00:44:57.930 --> 00:45:00.720
so it's one of the
first four rows.

00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:02.770
And b-plus in the second.

00:45:02.770 --> 00:45:16.600
So actually, it's these two
cases, N3 and N4, over N.

00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:18.970
We want to involve
three directions.

00:45:18.970 --> 00:45:21.660
So let's go for another one.

00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:27.180
P of a-plus with c-plus.

00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:28.900
Let's see how much is that.

00:45:28.900 --> 00:45:31.320
Again, this is for
the first particle.

00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:34.500
This is for the second particle.

00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:39.310
So I must look at
the first four rows.

00:45:39.310 --> 00:45:43.380
And see that you have an a-plus.

00:45:43.380 --> 00:45:46.530
First part is in a-plus
for the first four rows.

00:45:46.530 --> 00:45:48.590
But the second
should be in c-plus

00:45:48.590 --> 00:45:52.860
and that is cases N2 and N4.

00:45:52.860 --> 00:46:00.950
So we get N2 plus
N4 here over N.

00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:06.276
Well, we've involved
this a with b, a with c.

00:46:06.276 --> 00:46:10.880
How about involving b with c?

00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:13.835
So I'll put c-plus,
b-plus, for example.

00:46:18.190 --> 00:46:22.310
OK c-plus, b-plus.

00:46:22.310 --> 00:46:26.260
I must look at c-pluses,
and b-pluses, no.

00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:27.950
C-plus and b-plus, yes.

00:46:27.950 --> 00:46:31.840
N3 is there, which is good
because it already was there.

00:46:34.690 --> 00:46:36.510
And which else?

00:46:36.510 --> 00:46:39.620
c-plus and b-plus.

00:46:39.620 --> 00:46:41.240
c-plus, no.

00:46:41.240 --> 00:46:42.851
c-plus here b-plus, yes.

00:46:42.851 --> 00:46:43.350
N7.

00:46:53.820 --> 00:47:15.870
Now N3 plus N4 is less than
N3 plus N7 plus N4 plus N2.

00:47:15.870 --> 00:47:19.060
You see you have N3 and N4.

00:47:19.060 --> 00:47:24.410
And now I add whatever
N7 and N2 are.

00:47:24.410 --> 00:47:29.110
And that's then an
inequality because it's

00:47:29.110 --> 00:47:31.130
going to be more cases.

00:47:31.130 --> 00:47:40.780
Now I divide by N. So
you obtain an inequality

00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:49.630
that P of a-plus,
b-plus is less than

00:47:49.630 --> 00:47:56.550
or equal than N3 plus
N7 and N4 plus N2.

00:47:56.550 --> 00:48:03.770
I'll right the second
first, P of a-plus, c-plus

00:48:03.770 --> 00:48:07.600
plus P of c-plus, b-plus.

00:48:15.190 --> 00:48:19.700
So I didn't put specific
populations 1/3, 1/4.

00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:25.360
But in general whatever
populations you choose,

00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:28.450
this inequality must hold.

00:48:28.450 --> 00:48:31.040
So that's the more
clever strategy.

00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:34.730
Because suppose you
choose some populations

00:48:34.730 --> 00:48:37.580
and you don't get
in trouble, well,

00:48:37.580 --> 00:48:39.230
maybe with some
other populations

00:48:39.230 --> 00:48:40.480
you would get in trouble.

00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:43.380
Maybe it's not so easy to
get the relative factors.

00:48:43.380 --> 00:48:47.210
So here is something
that must be

00:48:47.210 --> 00:48:50.810
true whatever
populations you choose.

00:48:50.810 --> 00:48:56.030
And now that is
Bell's inequality.

00:48:56.030 --> 00:49:02.190
So the achievement
of Bell is to somehow

00:49:02.190 --> 00:49:08.960
translate this assumption of
realism into an inequality.

00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:17.180
And now quantum mechanics has
a formula for these things,

00:49:17.180 --> 00:49:18.450
for this probability.

00:49:18.450 --> 00:49:22.260
So we can test
whether this is true.

00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:25.030
So let's do that.

00:49:25.030 --> 00:49:28.200
This is the so-called
Bell inequality.

00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:34.605
So if quantum mechanics is
true, the following should hold.

00:49:42.630 --> 00:49:43.865
Let's see that.

00:49:48.590 --> 00:50:02.340
If QM is true,
well, there should

00:50:02.340 --> 00:50:04.600
be a problem with
this inequality.

00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:07.280
So let's see what happens.

00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:09.490
Let's see if it's
true, this inequality.

00:50:13.900 --> 00:50:16.050
Is it really true?

00:50:16.050 --> 00:50:19.980
Well, the left
hand side would be,

00:50:19.980 --> 00:50:23.760
given the formula
that we had, 1/2

00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:29.250
of the sine squared
of theta ab over 2.

00:50:33.750 --> 00:50:37.540
So let me just
emphasize, this was

00:50:37.540 --> 00:50:40.085
derived using local realism.

00:50:44.190 --> 00:50:46.790
Local realism gives that.

00:50:46.790 --> 00:50:50.910
So you do the experiment,
get these probabilities.

00:50:50.910 --> 00:50:55.350
And if realism is
true, this should hold.

00:50:55.350 --> 00:50:58.270
Let's see what quantum
mechanics has to say.

00:50:58.270 --> 00:51:03.390
Let's plug-in the values that
you get from quantum mechanics.

00:51:03.390 --> 00:51:05.500
Now we calculated
this probability.

00:51:05.500 --> 00:51:06.850
We put the first term.

00:51:06.850 --> 00:51:12.950
Here is sine squared of
theta ac over 2 and 1/2

00:51:12.950 --> 00:51:17.130
of sine squared theta bc over 2.

00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:23.810
So does that work?

00:51:23.810 --> 00:51:25.290
Does that always work?

00:51:25.290 --> 00:51:31.310
Can I orient this axis in
such a way to disprove EPR?

00:51:31.310 --> 00:51:36.150
And in fact, it turns out
to be quite easy to do that.

00:51:36.150 --> 00:51:41.280
So you choose three
vectors like this.

00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:50.610
ac, bc, so c here, a here,
and b here, I believe.

00:51:50.610 --> 00:51:52.000
Yep.

00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:55.770
So put an angle theta here.

00:51:55.770 --> 00:51:58.550
An angle theta here.

00:51:58.550 --> 00:52:00.650
And then what do you have?

00:52:00.650 --> 00:52:05.970
Theta ab would be 2 theta.

00:52:05.970 --> 00:52:15.210
Theta ac would be equal to
theta bc equal to theta.

00:52:15.210 --> 00:52:20.300
That's a pretty nice
simple choice of angles.

00:52:20.300 --> 00:52:23.260
If you choose these
angles now, let's

00:52:23.260 --> 00:52:26.060
see what happens
with our inequality.

00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:33.250
So you get 1/2 sine squared
theta ab over 2 would be theta.

00:52:33.250 --> 00:52:37.140
Is it less than
or equal to this?

00:52:37.140 --> 00:52:39.120
Well, these two become the same.

00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:44.090
So you get sine squared
of theta over 2.

00:52:48.080 --> 00:52:50.680
Violated or not violated?

00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:55.530
Is it true or false,
this, for all theta?

00:52:55.530 --> 00:52:56.330
What do you say?

00:53:02.150 --> 00:53:04.094
Yes?

00:53:04.094 --> 00:53:09.670
STUDENT: If theta is less
than pi, that's not true.

00:53:09.670 --> 00:53:11.770
PROFESSOR: Close.

00:53:11.770 --> 00:53:14.440
It's not true for a small theta.

00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:19.640
So if you're this, and
you're desperate to know,

00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:21.290
the thing you have
to do is assume

00:53:21.290 --> 00:53:23.030
theta is very, very small.

00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:24.530
See if you get in trouble.

00:53:24.530 --> 00:53:25.920
How much is this?

00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:27.843
1/2 theta squared.

00:53:31.715 --> 00:53:33.531
Let's see.

00:53:33.531 --> 00:53:34.900
Half of this one?

00:53:34.900 --> 00:53:36.280
Yeah.

00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:37.595
And how much is this?

00:53:37.595 --> 00:53:40.063
This is theta squared over 4.

00:53:40.063 --> 00:53:43.010
Sorry, I was not seeing it.

00:53:43.010 --> 00:53:46.780
Sine theta for small
theta is roughly theta.

00:53:46.780 --> 00:53:49.060
So here is theta over 2 squared.

00:53:49.060 --> 00:53:51.820
But here is 1/2 theta squared.

00:53:51.820 --> 00:53:54.590
And it's false.

00:53:54.590 --> 00:53:57.280
The 1/2 theta squared
is not smaller

00:53:57.280 --> 00:53:59.800
than one quarter theta squared.

00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:04.260
And in fact, for
theta equal pi over 2,

00:54:04.260 --> 00:54:07.640
I think this is an equality.

00:54:07.640 --> 00:54:11.260
Because theta equal
pi over 2, you

00:54:11.260 --> 00:54:14.210
get on the left hand
side 1/2 less than

00:54:14.210 --> 00:54:22.030
or equal than sine of 45
degrees, which is correct.

00:54:22.030 --> 00:54:25.430
So it's an equality
of pi over 2.

00:54:25.430 --> 00:54:27.770
Fails below.

00:54:27.770 --> 00:54:31.760
So it was a shock.

00:54:31.760 --> 00:54:37.370
That if you could do an
experiment in quantum mechanics

00:54:37.370 --> 00:54:45.290
and experiment with correlated,
entangled particles,

00:54:45.290 --> 00:54:48.580
that you could to measure
these probabilities,

00:54:48.580 --> 00:54:50.060
these correlations.

00:54:50.060 --> 00:54:54.740
And you would obtain a result
that actually contradicts

00:54:54.740 --> 00:54:57.710
for certain alignments
of your experiments

00:54:57.710 --> 00:55:00.440
the assumptions
of local realism.

00:55:00.440 --> 00:55:05.360
So it was a great
result of Bell to show

00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:09.630
that quantum mechanics
is in contradiction

00:55:09.630 --> 00:55:12.230
with local realism.

00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:18.600
There's no way to keep the
ideas of quantum mechanics

00:55:18.600 --> 00:55:21.550
and put hidden
variables and assume

00:55:21.550 --> 00:55:24.120
that there's real
values for things

00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:27.190
and that there's no
effect at a distance.

00:55:27.190 --> 00:55:30.330
It would all be contradicted
by an experiment.

00:55:30.330 --> 00:55:34.620
That was done later and
the definite version

00:55:34.620 --> 00:55:39.200
of the experiments
around 1980 or '82

00:55:39.200 --> 00:55:42.000
by Alan Aspect and others.

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:46.300
Very clever experiments worth
reading and understanding.

00:55:46.300 --> 00:55:51.780
But confirmed that the
quantum mechanical result

00:55:51.780 --> 00:55:54.730
is really true by
measuring correlated pairs.

00:55:54.730 --> 00:55:57.493
And this inequality is violated.

00:55:57.493 --> 00:55:57.993
Yes?

00:55:57.993 --> 00:56:00.132
STUDENT: So what about
David Bohm's theory

00:56:00.132 --> 00:56:01.746
of hidden variables
quantum mechanics?

00:56:01.746 --> 00:56:02.245
So--

00:56:02.245 --> 00:56:05.000
PROFESSOR: David
Bohm's theory of what?

00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:07.820
STUDENT: His hidden variable
quantum mechanics theory

00:56:07.820 --> 00:56:10.594
allegedly reproduces the same
results as quantum mechanics

00:56:10.594 --> 00:56:13.024
but it's still a hidden
variables theory.

00:56:13.024 --> 00:56:16.140
PROFESSOR: I don't think there's
any hidden variable theory that

00:56:16.140 --> 00:56:17.630
works.

00:56:17.630 --> 00:56:19.640
David Bohm, I
think, actually was

00:56:19.640 --> 00:56:24.050
credited by rewriting EPR,
who essentially talked

00:56:24.050 --> 00:56:28.580
about position and momenta
to talk about spins.

00:56:28.580 --> 00:56:30.500
And he might have been
the first one that

00:56:30.500 --> 00:56:33.090
began to try to do
hidden variable theory.

00:56:33.090 --> 00:56:36.610
But no hidden variable
theory works at this moment.

00:56:36.610 --> 00:56:38.780
And this shows it.

00:56:38.780 --> 00:56:42.680
So people say that
actually this assumes

00:56:42.680 --> 00:56:47.130
that there's local
hidden variable theories

00:56:47.130 --> 00:56:49.140
and there's non-local
hidden variable

00:56:49.140 --> 00:56:51.290
theories and all kinds
of strange things.

00:56:51.290 --> 00:56:53.760
But it's more and
more unnatural.

00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:56.440
So it doesn't seem to do
something very interesting.

00:56:56.440 --> 00:56:57.690
Yes, there are many questions.

00:56:57.690 --> 00:56:59.586
Aaron, maybe you want
to say something.

00:56:59.586 --> 00:57:02.442
STUDENT: Let's see, I think Bohm
has a non-local hidden variable

00:57:02.442 --> 00:57:03.400
theory solution.

00:57:03.400 --> 00:57:04.610
It's kind of awful looking.

00:57:04.610 --> 00:57:09.696
But I guess violates the
second principle rather than

00:57:09.696 --> 00:57:10.694
the first one.

00:57:10.694 --> 00:57:14.851
It also doesn't extend
to-- this doesn't really

00:57:14.851 --> 00:57:15.684
work for everything.

00:57:15.684 --> 00:57:19.343
We don't know how to make it
work for a spin-1/2 particle

00:57:19.343 --> 00:57:23.169
to find [? a dimension. ?] So
[INTERPOSING VOICES] really

00:57:23.169 --> 00:57:26.670
believe to be a true theory
of [? equivalence. ?]

00:57:26.670 --> 00:57:28.610
PROFESSOR: Thank you.

00:57:28.610 --> 00:57:30.810
More questions.

00:57:30.810 --> 00:57:32.244
Steve?

00:57:32.244 --> 00:57:36.334
STUDENT: In the case with EPR,
is it a problem that we can

00:57:36.334 --> 00:57:40.070
have scenarios where the spin
is greater than a spin-1/2

00:57:40.070 --> 00:57:41.480
particle would have?

00:57:41.480 --> 00:57:43.350
If we had the state
a-plus, b-plus, c-plus,

00:57:43.350 --> 00:57:47.260
we would have 3 h bar over 2?

00:57:47.260 --> 00:57:48.240
PROFESSOR: No.

00:57:48.240 --> 00:57:52.770
The statement that
is done here is not

00:57:52.770 --> 00:57:59.140
that-- well, this is a
label for a particle.

00:57:59.140 --> 00:58:03.110
EPR just assumed
that if you measured

00:58:03.110 --> 00:58:05.700
a you would be able to get this.

00:58:05.700 --> 00:58:09.080
If you measure along
b, you would get this.

00:58:09.080 --> 00:58:12.090
And if you measured along
c, you would get this.

00:58:12.090 --> 00:58:14.210
So this is a single particle.

00:58:14.210 --> 00:58:18.080
Any measurement gives some
results this side of the list.

00:58:18.080 --> 00:58:22.252
There's no sense in
which these are added.

00:58:22.252 --> 00:58:25.280
STUDENT: But even when you
measure one or the other,

00:58:25.280 --> 00:58:28.710
the other values still exist
for those measurements.

00:58:28.710 --> 00:58:32.740
PROFESSOR: Well,
I believe there's

00:58:32.740 --> 00:58:34.830
no need to discuss that.

00:58:34.830 --> 00:58:37.730
So they don't talk
about the statement

00:58:37.730 --> 00:58:41.530
of doing subsequent measurements
within this statement.

00:58:41.530 --> 00:58:44.180
You just take this
particle and you decide.

00:58:44.180 --> 00:58:47.320
You measure a or
measure b or measure c.

00:58:47.320 --> 00:58:49.640
You don't try to
measure simultaneously.

00:58:49.640 --> 00:58:52.650
You don't try to measure
one after another.

00:58:52.650 --> 00:58:54.680
You just do one measurement.

00:58:54.680 --> 00:58:58.070
And that already, which
is the minimum you can do,

00:58:58.070 --> 00:58:59.590
gets you in trouble.

00:58:59.590 --> 00:59:05.230
So I'm not sure how EPR would
phrase subsequent measurements

00:59:05.230 --> 00:59:07.000
after they've done
the first measurement

00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:07.890
or things like that.

00:59:07.890 --> 00:59:13.070
But they're not
necessary for this stage.

00:59:13.070 --> 00:59:17.440
OK, so look, it's a
very interesting thing.

00:59:17.440 --> 00:59:22.560
There's lots to discuss here,
but it's best if you read it.

00:59:22.560 --> 00:59:23.730
James had a question.

00:59:23.730 --> 00:59:26.050
Just let's take
one quick question.

00:59:26.050 --> 00:59:28.845
STUDENT: I was just wondering
if there was any other extension

00:59:28.845 --> 00:59:31.024
beyond three directions
for Bell's inequalities.

00:59:31.024 --> 00:59:33.886
Is there a N-direction
of Bell's inequalities

00:59:33.886 --> 00:59:35.317
or some type of form of it?

00:59:35.317 --> 00:59:36.760
Or is there [INAUDIBLE]

00:59:36.760 --> 00:59:41.110
PROFESSOR: There are other
forms of Bell inequalities.

00:59:41.110 --> 00:59:43.860
I'm not sure if it's
popular with four

00:59:43.860 --> 00:59:45.950
directions or anything.

00:59:45.950 --> 00:59:49.760
But certainly Weinberg, for
example, discuss other ways.

00:59:49.760 --> 00:59:52.740
There are alternative
ways to phrase it.

00:59:52.740 --> 00:59:57.010
I've talked about
here probabilities

00:59:57.010 --> 00:59:58.860
to observe results.

00:59:58.860 --> 01:00:01.520
There is a more,
perhaps, [? common ?] way

01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:06.640
talking about expectation
values or correlation functions.

01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:09.645
This is something you'll
do in the homework.

01:00:09.645 --> 01:00:13.810
The sort of game that is
done in the homework that

01:00:13.810 --> 01:00:17.030
was a suggestion by Aaron
to put it in the homework--

01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:21.340
this game in which with quantum
strategy and entangled pair

01:00:21.340 --> 01:00:25.400
you beat the system-- is yet
another formulation of the Bell

01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:27.850
inequalities as well.

01:00:27.850 --> 01:00:29.710
So lot to do.

01:00:29.710 --> 01:00:36.900
But I think it's better
now that we stop and talked

01:00:36.900 --> 01:00:43.050
about angular momentum from now
until the end of the semester.

01:00:43.050 --> 01:00:45.300
This was about spins,
but we now have

01:00:45.300 --> 01:00:49.540
to put together angular
momentum which is orbital

01:00:49.540 --> 01:00:52.350
and spin and all
the various kinds.

01:00:52.350 --> 01:00:54.965
So we'll begin with
angular momentum.

01:01:01.290 --> 01:01:05.500
So there are notes
on the web on that

01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:09.190
that I wrote and modified
a little this time.

01:01:09.190 --> 01:01:12.640
And lots of little exercises.

01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:15.910
So what I want to
do now is guide you

01:01:15.910 --> 01:01:19.210
through the things that
happen there so that you

01:01:19.210 --> 01:01:21.770
get a view of what
we're going to do.

01:01:21.770 --> 01:01:28.210
We're going to work with this
thing in a elegant way using

01:01:28.210 --> 01:01:30.640
vector notation for
operators is going

01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:33.560
to help us understand
things better.

01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:38.050
So we've seen angular
momentum before.

01:01:38.050 --> 01:01:43.250
And let me summarize simple
things that we know about it.

01:01:43.250 --> 01:01:49.390
If you have angular momentum,
and let's begin with orbital.

01:01:49.390 --> 01:01:56.950
This is what we have when we
take Lx to be y Pz minus z Py.

01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:04.768
Ly equals z Px minus x Pz.

01:02:08.330 --> 01:02:14.432
And Lz to be equal
to x Py minus y Pz.

01:02:18.010 --> 01:02:22.240
These are the angular momentum,
orbital angular momentum

01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:24.760
operators.

01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:28.270
Now, it's better for
many things to use labels

01:02:28.270 --> 01:02:32.900
like x, y, and z,
those operators.

01:02:32.900 --> 01:02:36.460
Call them x1 hat,
x2 hat, x3 hat.

01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:50.165
And Px, Py, Pz, P1, P2, P3.

01:02:53.220 --> 01:02:57.740
In that way you can write
commutation relations like xi,

01:02:57.740 --> 01:03:04.160
Pj equal i h bar delta ij.

01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:13.180
xi with xj equal
pi with pj equal 0.

01:03:13.180 --> 01:03:16.640
So it allows you to write
things more quickly.

01:03:19.570 --> 01:03:22.110
In fact, the angular
momentum operators

01:03:22.110 --> 01:03:24.490
become also a little simpler.

01:03:24.490 --> 01:03:33.360
It's sort of x2 P3 minus x3 P2.

01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:38.900
And you'll have the x,
y, z labels and all that.

01:03:38.900 --> 01:03:43.920
So we want to use
vector notation.

01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:46.820
Now, vector notation, you
can do it in two ways.

01:03:46.820 --> 01:03:48.220
You can talk about triplets.

01:03:48.220 --> 01:03:51.670
Those are vectors.

01:03:51.670 --> 01:03:55.440
Or you can form the
vectors themselves.

01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:57.270
Now if you form the
vectors, you get

01:03:57.270 --> 01:04:00.320
objects that sometimes are
a little disconcerting.

01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:03.480
But we try that they not be so.

01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:10.970
So here is the r
vector operator.

01:04:10.970 --> 01:04:14.250
You could think of it as
the triplet of x, y, and z.

01:04:14.250 --> 01:04:19.700
But let's call it like this,
x thing times the first basis

01:04:19.700 --> 01:04:25.510
vector plus y operator times
the second basis vector

01:04:25.510 --> 01:04:29.470
plus z operator times
the third basis vector.

01:04:29.470 --> 01:04:32.050
And we've done things like that.

01:04:32.050 --> 01:04:35.490
And we understand that
these basis vectors really

01:04:35.490 --> 01:04:38.910
don't talk with these operators.

01:04:38.910 --> 01:04:40.820
They can be moved
across each other.

01:04:40.820 --> 01:04:43.980
The basis vectors
are things that

01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:47.455
help you write
expressions, rather,

01:04:47.455 --> 01:04:50.430
at talking about triplets.

01:04:50.430 --> 01:04:51.765
Same thing for momentum.

01:04:55.030 --> 01:04:56.200
Let's do it this way.

01:04:56.200 --> 01:05:05.370
P1 e1 plus P2 e2 plus P3 e3.

01:05:05.370 --> 01:05:10.420
And finally, well, angular
momentum, the vector operator--

01:05:10.420 --> 01:05:14.930
you've done a lot of the
angular momentum vector operator

01:05:14.930 --> 01:05:16.810
for spin.

01:05:16.810 --> 01:05:30.590
So here you would put Lx or
L1 e1 plus L2 e2 plus L3 e3.

01:05:30.590 --> 01:05:37.510
So those are ways
to write equations

01:05:37.510 --> 01:05:42.850
that carry all the operators
and treat them as vectors, even

01:05:42.850 --> 01:05:44.200
though they're operators.

01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:46.460
So they're unusual vectors.

01:05:46.460 --> 01:05:52.690
They're vectors whose components
are operators, are not numbers.

01:05:52.690 --> 01:06:00.520
So the obvious question
is, what changes then?

01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:03.520
So we're going to define
dot product and cross

01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:06.770
products as we had before.

01:06:06.770 --> 01:06:12.380
But we have to be a little aware
that when we write these things

01:06:12.380 --> 01:06:15.360
we could make a mistake
unless we're not careful.

01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:18.560
So here are two
vector operators.

01:06:25.590 --> 01:06:29.990
What is the dot product of
these two vector operators?

01:06:29.990 --> 01:06:34.870
Well, you know it's supposed to
be the first component of this

01:06:34.870 --> 01:06:37.850
and the first component of that,
second second, third third.

01:06:37.850 --> 01:06:45.970
So it should be ai bi, summed.

01:06:45.970 --> 01:06:49.050
Repeated in this is
our [? summed. ?]

01:06:49.050 --> 01:06:55.110
Now, I should not write
bi ai with a reverse order

01:06:55.110 --> 01:06:59.430
because this thing, the
components, are now operators.

01:06:59.430 --> 01:07:01.840
And maybe they don't commute.

01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:06.573
So I've defined this once
and for all to be this.

01:07:06.573 --> 01:07:14.490
And a cross b, the i-th
component of this thing

01:07:14.490 --> 01:07:18.040
is going to be defined
once and for all

01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:24.454
to be epsilon ijk aj bk.

01:07:28.250 --> 01:07:29.675
Definition.

01:07:29.675 --> 01:07:32.046
The a to the left of the b.

01:07:35.238 --> 01:07:42.770
And with this, we can
check our usual rules

01:07:42.770 --> 01:07:44.730
of manipulation of operators.

01:07:44.730 --> 01:07:46.270
So one more definition.

01:07:46.270 --> 01:07:53.790
a squared is going to be aa,
and it's going to be ai ai.

01:08:00.190 --> 01:08:09.050
Simplest calculation is a
dot b equals to b dot a.

01:08:13.910 --> 01:08:15.100
Yes or not?

01:08:15.100 --> 01:08:16.710
No, they're operators.

01:08:16.710 --> 01:08:18.950
So let's calculate
the difference.

01:08:18.950 --> 01:08:22.822
Let's get a little practice
calculating differences.

01:08:29.750 --> 01:08:38.840
So I write a dot b is
equal to ai bi, its sum.

01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:47.149
So then I say, that's
ai bi plus bi ai.

01:08:47.149 --> 01:08:52.400
You see the commutator
is ai bi minus bi ai.

01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:55.399
And I add it back.

01:08:55.399 --> 01:09:01.149
But this thing,
bi ai is b dot a.

01:09:01.149 --> 01:09:03.319
So here I've got a formula.

01:09:03.319 --> 01:09:12.910
a dot b is equal, actually, to
b dot a plus this commutator,

01:09:12.910 --> 01:09:16.220
ai bi.

01:09:16.220 --> 01:09:23.420
And now you've got a new formula
for operator vector analysis.

01:09:23.420 --> 01:09:26.090
a dot b and b dot
a are not the same

01:09:26.090 --> 01:09:28.850
but they differ by this thing.

01:09:28.850 --> 01:09:35.540
And a very important corollary,
very famous corollary,

01:09:35.540 --> 01:09:39.800
what is r dot p?

01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:43.410
Is it the same as p dot r?

01:09:43.410 --> 01:09:45.649
If you're working
quantum mechanics

01:09:45.649 --> 01:09:48.970
you maybe tempted to, oh r dot
p and p dot r are the same,

01:09:48.970 --> 01:09:52.489
but r and p don't commute,
so what is the difference?

01:09:52.489 --> 01:10:01.095
R dot p is equal to
p dot r plus xi pi.

01:10:05.250 --> 01:10:07.910
And how much is that?

01:10:07.910 --> 01:10:09.670
[INAUDIBLE]

01:10:09.670 --> 01:10:11.145
Sorry?

01:10:11.145 --> 01:10:12.260
STUDENT: i h bar.

01:10:12.260 --> 01:10:13.400
PROFESSOR: i h bar?

01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:14.080
STUDENT: 3.

01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:15.720
PROFESSOR: 3 i h bar.

01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:17.910
Yes, don't forget the sum.

01:10:17.910 --> 01:10:19.620
This is supposed to be summed.

01:10:19.620 --> 01:10:24.920
So it says x1 commutative,
p1, x2 going to 3 i h bar.

01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:28.010
So here's a famous formula.

01:10:28.010 --> 01:10:37.758
rp differs from pr plus three h
bar i-- i h bar, people write.

01:10:37.758 --> 01:10:38.650
i h bar.

01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:51.350
Another formula that you
would be curious to know.

01:10:51.350 --> 01:10:55.500
Well, the dot product was
supposed to be symmetric.

01:10:55.500 --> 01:10:57.240
It's not.

01:10:57.240 --> 01:11:03.230
The cross product is
supposed to be antisymmetric.

01:11:03.230 --> 01:11:04.750
Is it or not?

01:11:04.750 --> 01:11:14.244
a cross b sub i is equal
to epsilon ijk aj bk.

01:11:16.980 --> 01:11:18.530
What do I do next?

01:11:18.530 --> 01:11:21.780
I want to move the
a and b's around.

01:11:21.780 --> 01:11:26.970
So I'm going to replace
this by a commutator

01:11:26.970 --> 01:11:30.550
plus the other ordering, ijk.

01:11:30.550 --> 01:11:36.130
And I put here-- well, this
would be a parentheses-- aj bk

01:11:36.130 --> 01:11:40.860
commutator plus bk aj.

01:11:47.300 --> 01:11:52.290
Now, what do we get?

01:11:52.290 --> 01:11:55.870
Well, you have to look
at the second term.

01:11:55.870 --> 01:12:01.060
Let's put the first term here
because that's-- pretty much,

01:12:01.060 --> 01:12:04.370
we're not going to be
able to do much with it.

01:12:04.370 --> 01:12:05.564
aj bk.

01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:11.400
And the first term, I
would write it like this.

01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:24.510
Minus epsilon, flip
these two, ikj bk aj.

01:12:24.510 --> 01:12:28.360
If you do it like
that, then it sort of

01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:32.100
fits nicely with the definition
of the cross product.

01:12:32.100 --> 01:12:37.320
Because in the cross product,
the first label those here,

01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:41.490
the second label goes with the
last labeled of the epsilon.

01:12:41.490 --> 01:12:50.400
So this thing is
minus b cross a.

01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:52.270
And that was a cross b.

01:12:55.460 --> 01:13:01.690
Plus epsilon ijk aj bk.

01:13:07.330 --> 01:13:11.520
So that's your formula for
of how the cross product.

01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:13.860
Now fails to be antisymmetric.

01:13:16.700 --> 01:13:19.770
It's not necessarily
antisymmetric

01:13:19.770 --> 01:13:23.460
unless you're lucky.

01:13:23.460 --> 01:13:33.700
So here is a property that
you should try to think about.

01:13:33.700 --> 01:13:36.950
How about r cross r?

01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:44.095
Is it 0 or not 0?

01:13:44.095 --> 01:13:45.770
r cross r.

01:13:45.770 --> 01:13:49.970
You could say,
what can I do here?

01:13:49.970 --> 01:13:57.720
Well, r cross r
minus r cross r--

01:13:57.720 --> 01:14:00.440
two r across r's should
be equal to this.

01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:03.740
But both components are x's.

01:14:03.740 --> 01:14:06.355
So r cross r is 0.

01:14:09.230 --> 01:14:20.060
p cross p, that's also 0.

01:14:20.060 --> 01:14:25.145
And therefore, say,
L cross L, is it 0?

01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:29.340
Maybe.

01:14:29.340 --> 01:14:29.946
Is that right?

01:14:32.780 --> 01:14:34.492
No.

01:14:34.492 --> 01:14:38.790
L cross L, we'll see
it a little later,

01:14:38.790 --> 01:14:44.070
but it's not 0 because one L
with another L don't commute.

01:14:47.740 --> 01:14:52.250
Lights, high.

01:14:52.250 --> 01:14:52.830
OK.

01:14:52.830 --> 01:14:58.330
So L cross L is actually not
0 because this thing is not 0.

01:14:58.330 --> 01:15:03.010
We'll talk about
it a little later.

01:15:03.010 --> 01:15:06.480
But actually this is
a very famous one.

01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:11.050
L cross L is proportional
to L with an h bar.

01:15:11.050 --> 01:15:14.660
It's a lovely formula.

01:15:14.660 --> 01:15:18.080
So another interesting thing.

01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:25.520
Well, what is r cross p?

01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:34.380
r cross p, from this formula
we would minus p cross r.

01:15:34.380 --> 01:15:36.120
And how about the other term?

01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:37.860
Is it 0 or not 0?

01:15:37.860 --> 01:15:42.380
Is r cross p equal to minus
p cross r, or does that fail?

01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:47.816
Well, r and p don't commute.

01:15:50.390 --> 01:15:53.570
Actually this formula--
I should have-- somebody

01:15:53.570 --> 01:15:55.050
should have complained.

01:15:55.050 --> 01:15:58.690
This should be the i-th
component, the i-th component,

01:15:58.690 --> 01:16:00.050
and here is the i-th component.

01:16:04.210 --> 01:16:08.120
So i-th component
the i-th component.

01:16:08.120 --> 01:16:09.990
But then let's look at here.

01:16:09.990 --> 01:16:19.580
Epsilon ijk xj pk.

01:16:19.580 --> 01:16:26.670
But xj and pk is
i h bar delta jk.

01:16:26.670 --> 01:16:30.060
Now, this delta jk is symmetric.

01:16:30.060 --> 01:16:31.110
This is antisymmetric.

01:16:34.260 --> 01:16:40.760
You should get accustomed
to the idea that that is 0.

01:16:40.760 --> 01:16:44.730
If this is antisymmetric and
this is symmetric, this is 0.

01:16:44.730 --> 01:16:47.770
Let me do it one more time.

01:16:47.770 --> 01:16:50.620
Maybe this is not
completely obvious.

01:16:50.620 --> 01:16:56.460
But epsilon ijk delta jk.

01:16:56.460 --> 01:16:58.810
The intuition is also obvious.

01:16:58.810 --> 01:17:01.470
Epsilon must have the
three numbers different

01:17:01.470 --> 01:17:03.659
and this forces
them to be the same.

01:17:03.659 --> 01:17:04.575
But it's more general.

01:17:04.575 --> 01:17:07.740
If this is antisymmetric
and this is symmetric,

01:17:07.740 --> 01:17:09.200
they should be 0.

01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:16.560
And the way you do that is
you say relabel j and k.

01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:19.210
Whatever was called j call it k.

01:17:19.210 --> 01:17:21.790
Whatever was called k call it j.

01:17:21.790 --> 01:17:28.850
So this is epsilon ikj delta kj.

01:17:28.850 --> 01:17:31.900
And then we use the
symmetry properties.

01:17:31.900 --> 01:17:35.240
So when you exchange this
back you get a minus sign when

01:17:35.240 --> 01:17:37.360
you exchange this back
you don't get a sign.

01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:42.690
So minus ijk delta jk.

01:17:42.690 --> 01:17:47.480
So you have shown that this
thing is equal to minus itself.

01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:50.440
And therefore it's 0.

01:17:50.440 --> 01:17:52.790
Something that's equal
to minus itself is 0.

01:17:52.790 --> 01:17:55.400
So this is 0.

01:17:55.400 --> 01:18:02.910
And you've got that r cross
p is really minus p cross r.

01:18:02.910 --> 01:18:07.480
And that's what we call the
angular momentum, r cross p.

01:18:07.480 --> 01:18:11.320
But now you know that it's
also equal to minus p cross r.

01:18:18.490 --> 01:18:22.840
Let's see, one other
one, for example,

01:18:22.840 --> 01:18:24.520
that is classically true.

01:18:24.520 --> 01:18:27.450
Let's see if it's quantum
mechanically true.

01:18:32.430 --> 01:18:38.430
r dot L. The angular
momentum L is supposed

01:18:38.430 --> 01:18:41.980
to be perpendicular
to r and perpendicular

01:18:41.980 --> 01:18:44.290
to p because this is
the cross product.

01:18:44.290 --> 01:18:50.440
Is that true quantum
mechanically or not true?

01:18:50.440 --> 01:18:56.550
Well, maybe I didn't say--
well, we said L is r cross p.

01:18:56.550 --> 01:19:02.580
So this is r dot r cross p.

01:19:06.510 --> 01:19:17.942
So this would be ri times
epsilon ijk-- no, x-- xj pk.

01:19:21.790 --> 01:19:24.250
So what is this?

01:19:24.250 --> 01:19:30.554
It's epsilon ijk xi xj pk.

01:19:35.110 --> 01:19:41.100
Well, this is 0 because these
two x's are operators but they

01:19:41.100 --> 01:19:42.130
commute.

01:19:42.130 --> 01:19:46.180
Therefore this object is
symmetrical in i and j.

01:19:46.180 --> 01:19:48.070
This is antisymmetric.

01:19:48.070 --> 01:19:49.430
This is 0.

01:19:49.430 --> 01:19:53.540
So r dot L is actually 0.

01:19:56.730 --> 01:20:02.660
How about p dot L.
Well, there's two ways

01:20:02.660 --> 01:20:05.470
of doing that, one that
looks pretty obvious,

01:20:05.470 --> 01:20:07.700
one that looks a little harder.

01:20:07.700 --> 01:20:09.850
Let's do the one that
looks a little harder.

01:20:09.850 --> 01:20:21.400
This would be pi
epsilon ijk xj pk.

01:20:27.330 --> 01:20:30.910
So here is the temptation.

01:20:30.910 --> 01:20:32.180
Must be 0.

01:20:32.180 --> 01:20:34.840
Because there is a pi pk.

01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:38.680
Symmetric in i and k.

01:20:38.680 --> 01:20:41.175
And here's antisymmetric
in i and k.

01:20:41.175 --> 01:20:44.150
But it's this wrong.

01:20:44.150 --> 01:20:46.030
These are not
obviously symmetric

01:20:46.030 --> 01:20:48.310
unless you can move them across.

01:20:48.310 --> 01:20:52.710
And there's an x in the
middle laughing at you

01:20:52.710 --> 01:20:55.690
and saying, beware.

01:20:55.690 --> 01:20:56.820
This could go wrong.

01:20:59.630 --> 01:21:02.890
So you have to be a
little more careful.

01:21:02.890 --> 01:21:05.880
So let's be careful.

01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:16.490
ijk and you put pi xj
pk, all our operators.

01:21:16.490 --> 01:21:23.050
But pi with xj the commutator
would be a delta ij and that

01:21:23.050 --> 01:21:23.710
vanishes.

01:21:23.710 --> 01:21:31.240
So this p actually can be moved
across the x and therefore show

01:21:31.240 --> 01:21:37.240
that the p is on the other side.

01:21:37.240 --> 01:21:39.350
Because the epsilon is there.

01:21:39.350 --> 01:21:40.840
So it's a lucky thing.

01:21:40.840 --> 01:21:48.490
So pi xj pk is not
symmetrical in i and k.

01:21:48.490 --> 01:21:51.240
But if there's an epsilon,
you're in better shape.

01:21:51.240 --> 01:22:00.260
So here the p can be
moved. ijk xj pi pk.

01:22:00.260 --> 01:22:04.930
And now nobody can stop you
from saying this is symmetric.

01:22:04.930 --> 01:22:08.790
They're next to each other, they
can be moved across each other.

01:22:08.790 --> 01:22:11.422
It's really
symmetric in i and k.

01:22:11.422 --> 01:22:15.370
And therefore i and k
antisymmetric, this is 0.

01:22:15.370 --> 01:22:19.790
p dot L is equal to 0 as well.

01:22:19.790 --> 01:22:22.130
So this was a
little bit hard way.

01:22:22.130 --> 01:22:28.970
If you had to used that L is
actually equal to p cross r,

01:22:28.970 --> 01:22:32.480
then the p would have been next
to the p from the beginning.

01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:34.490
And you would have
saved a little time.

01:22:34.490 --> 01:22:36.780
The same time that it
took you to realize

01:22:36.780 --> 01:22:41.110
that this equality is true.

01:22:41.110 --> 01:22:45.380
So those are true equalities.

01:22:45.380 --> 01:22:47.160
p dot L is 0.

01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:51.320
And it's also equal to L dot p.

01:22:51.320 --> 01:22:54.400
It's not obvious
that L and p commute.

01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:58.930
But in this case L dot p is 0.

01:22:58.930 --> 01:23:02.292
If you use this formula
for L, it's obvious.

01:23:02.292 --> 01:23:03.940
r dot L is 0.

01:23:03.940 --> 01:23:07.650
It's also equal to L dot r.

01:23:07.650 --> 01:23:09.440
Doesn't make a difference.

01:23:09.440 --> 01:23:11.890
It's also true as well.

01:23:11.890 --> 01:23:17.230
So that's roughly what goes on.

01:23:17.230 --> 01:23:22.150
Look, I would like you
to just read those pages.

01:23:22.150 --> 01:23:24.200
It's a continuation of this.

01:23:24.200 --> 01:23:27.230
It's about eight pages.

01:23:27.230 --> 01:23:29.840
I leave exercises to be done.

01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:31.180
That's in the homework.

01:23:31.180 --> 01:23:33.430
They're of this type,
playing with it.

01:23:33.430 --> 01:23:36.690
And this is a good thing that
you get accustomed to it.

01:23:36.690 --> 01:23:39.880
And the material
that you need just

01:23:39.880 --> 01:23:42.690
for the last problem
of the homework

01:23:42.690 --> 01:23:44.430
will be covered on Monday.

01:23:44.430 --> 01:23:47.740
And we can talk about it
in recitation tomorrow.

01:23:47.740 --> 01:23:50.750
So that's it for today.
