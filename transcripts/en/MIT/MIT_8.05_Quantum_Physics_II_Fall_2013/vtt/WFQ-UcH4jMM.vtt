00:00:21.885 --> 00:00:27.260
PROFESSOR: OK so we're going to
do this thing of the hydrogen

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.350
atom and the algebraic solution.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:38.930
And I think it's
not that long stuff

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.140
so we can take it
easy as we go along.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:47.480
I want to remind you of a couple
of facts that will play a role.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.290
One result that is very general
about the addition of angular

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.850
momentum that you
should of course know

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:02.530
is that if you
have a j1 times j2.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.500
What does this mean?

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:15.650
You have some states of--
first angular momentum J1

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.270
that so you have a
whole multiplet with J1

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.060
equals little j1.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:28.260
Which means the states in that
multiplet have J1 squared,

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.160
giving you h squared.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.370
Little j1 times
little j1 plus 1.

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.430
That's having a j1 multiplet.

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.050
You have a j2 multiplet.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.160
And these are two independent
commuting angular momenta

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.440
acting on different
degrees of freedom

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.020
of the same particle
or different particles.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.210
And what you've
learned is that this

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.570
can be written as a
sum of representations.

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.580
As a direct sum of
angular momenta,

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:17.114
which goes from j1 plus
j2 plus j1 plus j2 minus 1

00:02:17.114 --> 00:02:25.490
all the way up to
the representation

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.390
with j1 minus j2.

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.750
And these are all
representations or multiplets

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.070
that live in the
tense or product,

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:42.625
but they are multiplets
of J equals j1 plus j2.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:58.140
These states here
can be reorganized

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.970
into these
multiplets, and that's

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.120
our main result for the
addition of angular momentum.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.435
Mathematically, this
formula summarizes it all.

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.390
These states, when
you write them

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.520
as a basis here-- you
take a basis state here

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.540
times a basis state here-- these
are called the coupled bases.

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.990
And then you reorganize,
you form linear combinations

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:26.220
that you have been
playing with, and then

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.500
they get reorganized
into these states.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.610
So these are called
the coupled bases

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.720
in which we're
talking about states

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.660
of the sum of angular momentum.

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.500
So that's one fact
we've learned about.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.810
Now as far as
hydrogen is concerned,

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.490
we're going to try today
to understand the spectrum.

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:50.830
And for that let me remind
you what the spectrum was.

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:58.750
The way we organized it was
with an L versus energy levels.

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:04.770
And we would put an L equals
0 state here-- well maybe--

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:08.259
there's color, so
why not using color.

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:09.175
Let's see if it works.

00:04:16.715 --> 00:04:18.100
Yeah, it's OK.

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.050
L equals 0.

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:24.280
And this was called n equals 1.

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:31.020
There's an n equals 2 that
has an L equals 0 state

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.915
and an L equals 1 state.

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:42.650
There's an n equals 3
state, set of states

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:47.800
that come within L equals 0 and
L equals 1 and an L equals 2.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.980
And it just goes on and on.

00:04:54.980 --> 00:05:02.910
With the energy levels En
equals minus e squared over 2a0.

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:09.250
That combination is familiar
for energy, Bohr radius, charge

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:13.470
of electron, with
a 1 over n squared.

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:21.280
And the fact is that for
any level, for each n,

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:27.625
L goes from 0, 1,
2, up to n minus 1.

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:39.785
And for each n there's a
total of n squared states.

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:50.310
And you see it here, you have
n equals 2, n equals 1, one

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:50.930
state.

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:54.660
n equals 2, you have
L equals 0, one state.

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:56.530
L equals 1 is 3 states.

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:58.480
So it's 4.

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:01.080
Here we'll have 4 plus 5.

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:01.960
So 9.

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.990
And maybe you can do
it, it's a famous thing,

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:09.470
there's n squared
states at every level.

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:12.990
So this pattern that
of course continues

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:16.380
and-- it's a little
difficult to do

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:19.150
a nice diagram of the
hydrogen atom in scale

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:22.050
because it's all pushed
towards the zero energy

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:25.520
with 1 over n squared,
but that's how it goes.

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:30.165
For n equals 4, you have
1, 2, 3, 4 for example.

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:35.383
And this is what we
want to understand.

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:53.060
So in order to do that, let's
return to this Hamiltonian,

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:59.690
which is p squared over
2m minus e squared over r.

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:04.486
And to the Runge-Lenz vector
that we talked about in lecture

00:07:04.486 --> 00:07:07.340
and you've been playing with.

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:13.170
So this Runge-Lenz
vector, r, is defined

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:26.830
to be 1 over 2me squared p
cross L minus L cross p minus r

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:29.470
over r.

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:30.860
And it has no units.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.290
It's a vector that
you've learned

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:44.150
has interpretation of
a constant vector that

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:48.520
points in this direction, r.

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:52.010
And it just stays fixed
wherever the particle is going.

00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:54.570
Classically this is
a constant vector

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:58.820
that points in the direction of
the major axis of the ellipse.

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:06.080
With respect to this vector,
this vector is Hermitian.

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:10.320
And you may recall that when
we did the classical vector,

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:16.660
you had just p cross
L and no 2 here.

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:19.550
There are now two terms here.

00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:23.040
And they are necessary because
we want to have a Hermitian

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:25.790
operator, and this
is the simplest

00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:29.790
way to construct the
Hermitian operator, r.

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:35.510
And the way is that you
add to this this term,

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:40.580
that if L and p commuted as
they do in classical mechanics,

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:43.240
that the term is
identical to this.

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:45.530
And you get back to
the conventional thing

00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:47.920
that you had in
classical mechanics.

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:51.130
But in quantum mechanics, of
course, they don't commute,

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:54.110
so it's a little bit different.

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:59.580
And moreover this
thing, r, is Hermitian.

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:02.780
L and p are Hermitian but
when you take the Hermitian

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:08.110
conjugate, L goes to
the other side of p.

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:11.050
And since they don't commute,
that's not the same thing.

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:15.100
So actually the Hermitian
conjugate of this term is this.

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:18.100
There's an extra minus
sign in hermiticity

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:20.500
when you have a cross product.

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:22.500
So this is the Hermitian
conjugate of this,

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:25.120
this is the Hermitian
conjugate of this second term,

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:29.300
here's the first and
therefore this is actually

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:31.010
a Hermitian operator.

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:32.120
And you can work with it.

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:39.480
Moreover, in the case
of classical mechanics,

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:42.190
it was conserved.

00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:45.240
In the case of quantum
mechanics this statement

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:47.350
of conservation
quantum mechanics

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:53.610
is something that in one of the
exercises that you were asked

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:57.460
to try to do this computation
so these computations

00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:00.490
are challenging.

00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:04.280
They're not all that trivial
and are good exercises.

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:07.670
So this is one of them.

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:09.400
This is practice.

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:21.940
OK this is the vector r.

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:23.140
What about it?

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:27.900
A few more things about
it that are interesting.

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:31.840
Because of the
hermiticity condition

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:35.840
or in-- a way you can
check this directly

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:39.710
in fact was one of the
exercises for you to do,

00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:42.770
was p cross L-- you
did it long time ago,

00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:50.320
I think-- is equal to minus
L cross b plus 2ih bar p.

00:10:52.833 --> 00:10:53.666
This is an identity.

00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:12.100
And this identity helps
you write this kind of term

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:16.120
in a way in which you have
just one order of products

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:18.400
and a little extra
term, rather than

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:21.290
having two complicated terms.

00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:30.100
So the r can be
written as 1 over me

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:45.650
squared alone, p cross L
minus ihp minus r over r.

00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:46.243
For example.

00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:58.410
By writing this term as another
p cross L minus that thing

00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:01.550
gives you that expression for r.

00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:03.630
You have an
alternative expression

00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:05.720
in which you solve
for the other one.

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:14.820
So it's 1 over me squared
minus L cross p plus ih bar p.

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:27.460
Now, r-- we need to
understand r better.

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:31.930
That's really the challenge
of this whole derivation.

00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:35.250
So we have one thing
that is conserved.

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:37.440
Angular momentum is conserved.

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:40.380
It commutes with
the Hamiltonian.

00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:44.530
We have another thing
that is conserved, this r.

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:47.200
But we have to understand
better what it is.

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:52.560
So one thing that you can
ask is, well, r is conserved,

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:56.320
so r squared is
conserved as well.

00:12:56.320 --> 00:13:01.260
So r squared, if I can simplify
it-- if I can do the algebra

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:06.650
and simplify it-- it should
not be that complicated.

00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:11.810
So again a practice problem was
given to do that computation.

00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:17.840
And I think these forms are
useful for that, to work less.

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:20.520
And the computation
gives a very nice result,

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:29.340
where r squared is equal
to 1 plus 2 H over me

00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:35.690
to the fourth L squared
plus h bar squared.

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:40.160
Kind of a strange result
if you think about it.

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:42.380
People that want to
do this classically

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:44.855
first would find that
there's no h squared.

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:53.040
And here, this h, is that
whole h that we have here.

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:55.430
It's a complicated thing.

00:13:55.430 --> 00:14:00.360
So this right hand side
is quite substantial.

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:03.580
You don't have to worry
that h is in this side

00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:05.670
or whether it's
on the other side

00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:10.480
because h commutes
with L. L is conserved.

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:13.550
So h appears like that.

00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:17.376
And this, again, is the
result of another computation.

00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:23.120
So we've learned something.

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:26.630
r-- oh, I'm sorry,
this is r squared.

00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:29.070
Apologies.

00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:30.590
r is conserved.

00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:34.630
r squared must be conserved
because if h commutes with r

00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:37.310
it commutes with
r squared as well.

00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:40.050
And therefore whatever you
see on the right hand side,

00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:41.810
the whole thing
must be conserved.

00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:44.660
And h is conserved, of course.

00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:49.320
And L squared is conserved.

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:55.220
Now we need one more property
of a relation-- you see,

00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:57.540
you have to do these things.

00:14:57.540 --> 00:15:02.470
Even if you probably don't have
an inspiration at this moment

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:04.610
how you're going to
try to understand this,

00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:06.935
there are things
that just curiosity

00:15:06.935 --> 00:15:09.370
should tell that you should do.

00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:12.270
We have L, we do L squared.

00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:14.560
It's an important operator.

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:15.060
OK.

00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:19.920
We had r, we did r squared,
which is an important operator.

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:23.396
But one thing we
can do is L dot r.

00:15:23.396 --> 00:15:26.030
It's a good question
what L dot r is.

00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:31.430
So what is L dot r?

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:47.560
So-- or r dot L. What is it?

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:53.830
Well a few things that
are important to note

00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:58.902
are that you did
show before that you

00:15:58.902 --> 00:16:07.490
know that r dot L,
little r dot L, is 0.

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:14.220
And little p dot L is 0.

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:18.500
These are obvious
classically, because L

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:21.210
is perpendicular
to both r and p.

00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:26.480
But quantum mechanically
they take a little more work.

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:30.170
They're not complicated,
but you've shown those two.

00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:38.660
So if you have r dot
L, you would have,

00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:42.550
for example, here--
r dot L, you would

00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:50.260
have to do and think
of this whole r

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:52.370
and put an L on the right.

00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:59.660
Well this little r dotted with
the L on the right would be 0.

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:06.569
That p dotted with L on
the right would be 0.

00:17:06.569 --> 00:17:11.530
And we're almost there,
but p cross L dot L,

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:14.460
well, what is that?

00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:16.490
Let me talk about it here.

00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:24.130
P cross L dot L--
so this is part

00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:27.750
of the computation of this
r dot L. We've already

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:29.510
seen this term
will give nothing,

00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:30.990
this term will give nothing.

00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:34.180
But this term could
give something.

00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:37.360
So when you face
something like that,

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:38.900
maybe you say,
well, I don't know

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:41.610
any identities I
should be using here.

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:48.510
So you just do it.

00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:51.180
Then you say, this
is i-th component

00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:53.460
of this vector times
the i-th of that.

00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:55.070
So it's epsilon ijkpjLkLi.

00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:12.960
And then you say look this
looks a little-- you could

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:16.850
say many things that are wrong
and get the right answer.

00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:21.685
So you could say,
oh, ki symmetric

00:18:21.685 --> 00:18:23.560
and ki anti-symmetric.

00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:27.000
But that's wrong, because
these k and i are not

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.280
symmetric really because
these operators don't commute.

00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:39.730
So the answer will be zero, but
for a more complicated reason.

00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:41.600
So what do you have in here?

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:42.930
ki.

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:47.798
Let's move the i to the end
of the epsilon, so jkipjLkLi.

00:18:53.980 --> 00:19:02.390
And now you see this part
is pj L cross cross L j.

00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:12.740
Is the cross product of this.

00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:14.870
But what is L cross L?

00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:16.340
You probably remember.

00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:24.010
This is ih bar L
L cross L, that's

00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:28.240
the computation in relation
of angular momentum.

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:31.680
In case you kind
of don't remember

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:35.120
it was ih bar L. Like that.

00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:40.190
So now p dot L is anyway 0.

00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:43.160
So this is 0.

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:48.485
So it's kind of--
it's a little delicate

00:19:48.485 --> 00:19:50.080
to do these computations.

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:54.830
But so since that term is
zero, this thing is zero.

00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:05.170
Now you may as
well-- r dot L is 0.

00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:09.610
Is L dot r also 0?

00:20:09.610 --> 00:20:12.150
It's not all that obvious
you can even do that.

00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:15.730
Well in a second we'll see
that that's true as well.

00:20:15.730 --> 00:20:20.840
L dot r and r dot
L, capital R, are 0.

00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:37.000
Let's remember-- let's
continue-- let's see,

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.510
I wanted to number some
of these equations.

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:45.090
We're going to need them.

00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:46.850
So this will be equation one.

00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:57.030
This will be equation two,
it's an important one.

00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:11.700
Now what was-- let me
remind you of a notation

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:15.260
we also had about vectors
and their rotations.

00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:19.015
Vector under rotations.

00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:32.020
So what was a vector,
Vi, under rotations

00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:39.380
was something that you had LiVj
equals ih bar epsilon ijkvk.

00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:51.760
So there is a way to write
this with cross products that

00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:53.500
is useful in some cases.

00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:58.270
So I will do it.

00:21:58.270 --> 00:22:00.400
You probably have seen
that in the notes,

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:02.090
but let me remind you.

00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:06.370
Consider this product,
L cross V plus V

00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:11.230
cross L and the i-th
component of it.

00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:17.440
i-th component of this product.

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:25.737
So this is epsilon ijk and
you have LjVk plus VjLk.

00:22:34.130 --> 00:22:42.160
Now in this term you
can do something nice.

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:45.160
If you think of it
like expanded out,

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:48.580
you have the second
term has epsilon ijkVjk.

00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:54.730
Change j for k.

00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:57.286
If you change j for
k, this will be VkLj.

00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:02.320
And these would have
the opposite order.

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:06.460
But this order can be changed
up to the cost of a minus sign.

00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:14.832
So I claim this is ijk-- first
term is the same-- minus VkLj.

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:23.920
So in the second term,
for this term alone, we've

00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:26.960
done for this term, multiplied
with this of course,

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:29.560
we've done j and k relabeling.

00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:46.320
But this is nothing else than
the commutator of L with V.

00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:47.790
So this is epsilon ijkLjVk.

00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:05.560
That's epsilon ijk, and
this is epsilon jkp or LVL.

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:17.380
Now, 2 epsilons with
2 common indices

00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:20.410
is something that it simple.

00:24:20.410 --> 00:24:24.150
It's a commutator dealt
on the other indices.

00:24:24.150 --> 00:24:28.740
Now it's better if they are sort
of all aligned in the same way,

00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:33.140
but they kind of are because
this L, without paying a price,

00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:34.830
can be put as the first index.

00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:38.080
So you have jk as
the second and third

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:40.290
and-- jk as the
second and third--

00:24:40.290 --> 00:24:44.230
once L has been moved
to the first position.

00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:52.720
So this thing is
2 times delta iL.

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:57.660
And there's an h bar,
ih bar I forgot here.

00:24:57.660 --> 00:24:59.070
ih bar.

00:24:59.070 --> 00:25:06.410
2 delta ik ih bar iL ih bar VL.

00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:10.070
So this is 2 ih bar Vi.

00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:16.610
So this whole thing the i-th
component of this thing,

00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:19.720
using this commutation
relation is this.

00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:23.060
So what we've learned
is that L cross

00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:33.820
V plus V cross L you
see go to 2 ih bar V.

00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:42.430
And that's a statement as a
vector relation of the fact

00:25:42.430 --> 00:25:46.160
that V is a vector
in the rotations.

00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:52.830
So for V to be a vector in
the rotations means this.

00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:57.200
And if you wish, it
means this thing as well.

00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:00.470
It's just another
thing of what it means.

00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:05.280
Now R is a vector
in the rotations.

00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:08.980
This capital R. Why?

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:15.850
You've shown that if you have
a vector in the rotations

00:26:15.850 --> 00:26:18.670
and you multiply it by another
vector in the rotations

00:26:18.670 --> 00:26:20.510
under the cross
product, it's still

00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:22.040
a vector in the rotations.

00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:24.810
So this is a vector in
the rotations, this is,

00:26:24.810 --> 00:26:27.850
and this is a vector
in the rotations.

00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:29.620
R is a vector in the rotations.

00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:45.630
So this capital R is a
vector on the rotations,

00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:48.110
which means two things.

00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:52.890
It means it satisfies
this kind of equation.

00:26:52.890 --> 00:27:19.910
So r cross-- or L cross R plus
R cross L is equal to ih bar R.

00:27:19.910 --> 00:27:23.570
So R is a vector
in the rotation.

00:27:23.570 --> 00:27:27.330
It's a fact beyond doubt.

00:27:27.330 --> 00:27:31.030
And that means that we now
know the commutation relations

00:27:31.030 --> 00:27:35.060
between L and R. So we're
starting to put together

00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:39.160
this picture in which
we get familiar with R

00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:41.950
and the commutators
that are possible.

00:27:41.950 --> 00:27:45.470
So I can summarize it here.

00:27:55.170 --> 00:28:03.900
L dot R LiRj is ih
bar epsilon ijkRk.

00:28:08.410 --> 00:28:12.900
That's the same statement as
this one but in components.

00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:23.140
And now you see why R dot
L is equal to L dot R.

00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:29.150
Because actually if you put the
same two indices here, i and i,

00:28:29.150 --> 00:28:30.130
you get zero.

00:28:30.130 --> 00:28:39.410
So when you have R dot L you
have R1L1 plus R2L2 plus R3L3.

00:28:39.410 --> 00:28:41.700
And each of these
two commute when

00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:43.740
the two indices are the same.

00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:45.090
Because of the epsilon.

00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:47.640
So R dot L is 0.

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:54.710
And now you also appreciate
that L dot R is also 0, too.

00:29:00.226 --> 00:29:00.725
OK.

00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:09.440
Now comes, in a sense, the most
difficult of all calculations.

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:11.840
Even if this seemed
a little easy.

00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:15.680
But you can get
quite far with it.

00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:18.800
So what do you do with Ls?

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:22.550
You computed L
commutators and you

00:29:22.550 --> 00:29:24.750
got the algebra of
angular momentum.

00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:29.810
Over here.

00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:32.440
This is the algebra
for angular momentum.

00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:36.610
And this kind of
nontrivial calculation,

00:29:36.610 --> 00:29:38.560
you did it by building results.

00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:41.510
You knew how R was a
vector in the rotation

00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:43.430
or how p was a vector
in the rotation.

00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:48.170
You multiplied the two of them,
and it was not so difficult.

00:29:48.170 --> 00:29:54.070
But the calculation that
you really need to do now

00:29:54.070 --> 00:30:01.540
is the calculation of the
commutator say of Ri with Rj.

00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:04.340
And that looks like a
little bit of a nightmare.

00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:10.420
You have to commute this
whole thing with itself.

00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:13.750
Lots of p's, L's, R's.

00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:16.790
1 over R's, those
don't commute with p.

00:30:16.790 --> 00:30:18.870
You remember that.

00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:21.550
So this kind of calculation
done by brute force.

00:30:21.550 --> 00:30:25.120
You're talking a day, probably.

00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:26.690
I think so.

00:30:26.690 --> 00:30:29.500
And probably it
becomes a mess, but.

00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:32.160
You'll find a little trick
helps to organize it better.

00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:34.380
It's less of a
mess, but still you

00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:38.200
don't get it and--
try several times.

00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:42.320
So what we're going
to do is try to think

00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:46.550
of what the answer could
be by some arguments.

00:30:46.550 --> 00:30:50.210
And then once we know
what the answer can be,

00:30:50.210 --> 00:30:53.020
there's still one
calculation to be done.

00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:55.780
That I will probably
put in the notes,

00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:58.050
but it's not a difficult one.

00:30:58.050 --> 00:31:01.420
And the answer just pops out.

00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:10.220
So the question is what is R
cross R. R cross R is really

00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:14.040
what we have when we
have this commutator.

00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:19.650
So we need to know what R cross
R is, just like L cross L.

00:31:19.650 --> 00:31:25.420
Now R is not likely to
be an angular momentum.

00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:27.880
It's a vector but it's
not an angular momentum.

00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:30.610
Has nothing to do with it.

00:31:30.610 --> 00:31:32.270
It's more complicated.

00:31:32.270 --> 00:31:36.140
So what is R cross R
quantum-mechanically?

00:31:36.140 --> 00:31:40.200
Classically, of course,
it would be zero.

00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:46.230
So first thing is you think
of what this should be.

00:31:50.330 --> 00:31:56.720
We have a vector, because the
cross product of two vectors.

00:31:56.720 --> 00:32:01.900
Now I want to emphasize
one other thing,

00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:08.870
that it should be this
thing-- R cross R-- is

00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:10.330
tantamount to this thing.

00:32:10.330 --> 00:32:11.590
What is this thing?

00:32:14.450 --> 00:32:17.660
It should be
actually proportional

00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:19.675
to some conserved quantity.

00:32:22.510 --> 00:32:26.640
And the reason is
quite interesting.

00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:29.545
So this is a small aside here.

00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:36.870
If some operator
is conserved, it

00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:38.440
commutes with the Hamiltonian.

00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:52.595
Say if S1 and S2 are symmetries,
that means that S1 with h

00:32:52.595 --> 00:32:59.506
is equal to S2 with
h is equal to zero.

00:32:59.506 --> 00:33:05.580
Then the claim is that the
commutator of this S1 and S2

00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:12.255
claim S1 commutator with
S2 is also a symmetry.

00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:21.120
So the reason is
because commutator

00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:29.425
of S1 S2 commutator with h
is equal actually to zero.

00:33:29.425 --> 00:33:32.500
And why would it
be equal to zero?

00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:34.840
It's because of the
so-called Jacobi

00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:37.580
identity for commutators.

00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:41.930
You'll remember when you
have three things like that,

00:33:41.930 --> 00:33:46.355
this term is equal to
1-- this term plus 1,

00:33:46.355 --> 00:33:48.050
in which you cycle them.

00:33:48.050 --> 00:33:51.390
And plus another one
where you cycle them again

00:33:51.390 --> 00:33:53.230
is equal to zero.

00:33:53.230 --> 00:33:55.600
That's a Jacobi identity.

00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:59.460
And in those cyclings
you get an h with S2,

00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:01.710
for example, that is zero.

00:34:01.710 --> 00:34:04.090
And then an h with
S1, which is zero.

00:34:04.090 --> 00:34:08.310
So you use these things
here and you prove that.

00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:09.959
So I write here, by Jacobi.

00:34:14.250 --> 00:34:17.520
So if you have a
conserved-- this

00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:20.630
is the great thing about
conserved quantities,

00:34:20.630 --> 00:34:24.050
if you have one conserved
quantity, it's OK.

00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:26.300
But if you have two,
you're in business.

00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:29.985
Because you can then take the
commutator of these two and you

00:34:29.985 --> 00:34:31.400
get another conserved quantity.

00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:34.830
And then more commutators and
you keep taking commutators

00:34:34.830 --> 00:34:39.420
and if you're lucky you get all
of the conserved quantities.

00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:45.480
So here R cross R refers
to this commutator.

00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:48.670
So whatever is on the
right should be a vector

00:34:48.670 --> 00:34:50.375
and should be conserved.

00:34:57.460 --> 00:35:03.270
And what are our
conserved vectors?

00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:11.210
Well our conserved
vectors-- candidates here--

00:35:11.210 --> 00:35:25.130
are L, R itself, and L cross
R. That's pretty much it.

00:35:25.130 --> 00:35:30.330
L and R are our only conserved
things, so it better be that.

00:35:35.450 --> 00:35:39.370
Still this is far too much.

00:35:39.370 --> 00:35:41.330
So there could be
a term proportional

00:35:41.330 --> 00:35:46.650
to L, a term proportional to R,
a term proportional to L dot R.

00:35:46.650 --> 00:35:51.940
So this kind of analysis
is based by something

00:35:51.940 --> 00:35:53.760
that Julian Schwinger did.

00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:57.090
This same guy that
actually did quantum

00:35:57.090 --> 00:36:01.940
electrodynamics along
with Feynman and Tomonaga.

00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:04.360
And he's the one of
those who invented

00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:07.870
the trick of using
three-dimensional angular

00:36:07.870 --> 00:36:10.770
momentum for the
two-dimensional oscillator.

00:36:10.770 --> 00:36:13.860
And had lots of bags of tricks.

00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:16.920
So actually this whole
discussion of the hydrogen

00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:22.200
atom-- most books just say,
well, these calculations are

00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:22.810
hopeless.

00:36:22.810 --> 00:36:25.330
Let me give you the answers.

00:36:25.330 --> 00:36:28.780
Schwinger, on the other hand, in
his book on quantum mechanics--

00:36:28.780 --> 00:36:33.940
which is kind of interesting
but very idiosyncratic--

00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:37.910
finds a trick to do
every calculation.

00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:41.230
So you never get
into a big mess.

00:36:41.230 --> 00:36:44.980
He's absolutely elegant
and keeps pulling tricks

00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:45.700
from the bag.

00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:49.830
So this is one of those tricks.

00:36:49.830 --> 00:36:54.180
Basically he goes through
the following analysis now

00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:59.490
and says, look, suppose
I have the vector R

00:36:59.490 --> 00:37:01.960
and I do a parity
transformation.

00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:05.490
I change it for minus R.

00:37:05.490 --> 00:37:10.010
What happens under
those circumstances?

00:37:10.010 --> 00:37:15.950
Well the momentum is
the rate of change of R,

00:37:15.950 --> 00:37:18.260
should also change sign.

00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:20.840
Quantum mechanically
this is consistent,

00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:25.590
because a commutation between
R and p should give you h bar.

00:37:25.590 --> 00:37:31.810
And if R changes, p
should change sign.

00:37:31.810 --> 00:37:37.530
But now when you do this,
L, which is R cross p,

00:37:37.530 --> 00:37:47.960
just goes to L. And R,
however, changes sign

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:53.320
because L doesn't change
sign but p does and R does.

00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:57.330
So under these changes--
so this is the originator,

00:37:57.330 --> 00:38:00.140
the troublemaker and
then everybody else

00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:04.875
follows-- R also changes sign.

00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:16.100
So this is extremely powerful
because if you imagine

00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:18.840
this being equal to
something, well it

00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:21.980
should be consistent
with the symmetries.

00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:28.470
So as I change R to minus
R, capital R changes sign

00:38:28.470 --> 00:38:32.550
but the left hand side
doesn't change sign.

00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:36.210
Therefore the right hand
side should not change sign.

00:38:36.210 --> 00:38:42.080
And R changes sign and
L cross R changes sign.

00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:45.590
So computation kind of
finished because the only thing

00:38:45.590 --> 00:38:53.220
you can get on the right is L.

00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:55.520
This is the kind of
thing that you do

00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:57.910
and probably if you
were writing a paper on

00:38:57.910 --> 00:39:01.400
that you would anyway
do the calculation.

00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:05.420
The silly way,
the- the right way.

00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:08.880
But this is quite save of times.

00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:11.300
So actually what
you have learned

00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:24.940
is that R cross R is equal to
some scalar conserved quantity,

00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:28.240
which is something that
is conserved that could

00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:31.020
be like an h, for example, here.

00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:33.130
But it's a scalar.

00:39:33.130 --> 00:39:37.480
And, L.

00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:41.290
Well once you know that much,
it doesn't take much work

00:39:41.290 --> 00:39:43.810
to do this and to
calculate what it is.

00:39:43.810 --> 00:39:47.670
But I will skip
that calculation.

00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:51.440
This is the sort of
thoughtful part of it.

00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:59.820
And R cross R turns out to
be ih bar minus 2 h again.

00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:04.060
h shows up in several
places, like here,

00:40:04.060 --> 00:40:08.920
so it tends-- it has
a tendency to show up.

00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:16.210
me to the fourth L.

00:40:16.210 --> 00:40:24.640
So this is our equation
for-- and in a sense,

00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:29.020
all the hard work has been done.

00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:32.940
Because now you have a complete
understanding of these two

00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:36.470
vectors, L and R. You
know what L squared is,

00:40:36.470 --> 00:40:39.235
what R squared is,
what L dot R is.

00:40:39.235 --> 00:40:41.115
And you know all
the commutators,

00:40:41.115 --> 00:40:46.600
you know the commutation of L
with L, L with R, and R with R.

00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:50.140
You've done all
the algebraic work.

00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:53.360
And the question is, how
do we proceed from now

00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:57.960
to solve the hydrogen atom.

00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:02.610
So the way we proceed
is kind of interesting.

00:41:02.610 --> 00:41:07.270
We're going to try to
build from this L that

00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:09.530
is an angular momentum.

00:41:09.530 --> 00:41:14.890
And this R that is not
an angular momentum.

00:41:14.890 --> 00:41:18.300
Two sets of angular momenta.

00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:19.620
You have two vectors.

00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:23.730
So somehow we want to try to
combine them in such a way

00:41:23.730 --> 00:41:27.500
that we can invent
two angular momenta.

00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:30.070
Just like the
angular momentum in

00:41:30.070 --> 00:41:32.810
the two-dimensional
harmonic oscillator.

00:41:32.810 --> 00:41:37.860
It was not directly
through angular momentum,

00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:40.450
but was mathematical
angular momentum.

00:41:40.450 --> 00:41:43.910
These two angular momenta we're
going to build, one of them

00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:46.870
is going to be recognizable.

00:41:46.870 --> 00:41:49.130
The other one is going to
be a little unfamiliar.

00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:55.540
But now I have to do
something that-- it

00:41:55.540 --> 00:42:00.380
may sound a little
unusual, but is

00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:03.570
necessary to simplify our life.

00:42:03.570 --> 00:42:07.120
I want to say some
words that will

00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:13.640
allow me to think of
this h here as a number.

00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:19.280
And would allow me to think
of this h as a number.

00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:22.150
So here's what
we're going to say.

00:42:22.150 --> 00:42:25.025
It's an assumption--
it's no assumption,

00:42:25.025 --> 00:42:27.180
but it sounds like
an assumption.

00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:29.330
But there's no
assumption whatsoever.

00:42:29.330 --> 00:42:33.880
We say the following:
this hydrogen atom

00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:36.990
is going to have some states.

00:42:36.990 --> 00:42:44.590
So let's assume there is one
state, and it has some energy.

00:42:44.590 --> 00:42:48.180
If I have that state
with some energy, well,

00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:50.360
that would be the
end of the story.

00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:53.570
But in fact, the
thing that they want

00:42:53.570 --> 00:42:57.200
to allow the possibility for is
that at that the energy there

00:42:57.200 --> 00:42:59.870
are more states.

00:42:59.870 --> 00:43:04.070
One state would be OK,
maybe sometimes it happens.

00:43:04.070 --> 00:43:08.250
But in general there are
more states at that energy.

00:43:08.250 --> 00:43:13.370
So I don't-- I'm not making any
physical assumption to state

00:43:13.370 --> 00:43:18.040
that there is a subspace
of degenerate states.

00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:22.530
And in that subspace
of degenerate states,

00:43:22.530 --> 00:43:24.820
there may be just one
state, there are two states,

00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:26.278
there are three
states, but there's

00:43:26.278 --> 00:43:31.740
subspace of degenerate
states that have some energy.

00:43:31.740 --> 00:43:35.750
And I'm going to work
in that subspace.

00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:37.830
And all the
operators that I have

00:43:37.830 --> 00:43:40.500
are going to be acting
in that subspace.

00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:42.790
And I'm going to
analyze subspace

00:43:42.790 --> 00:43:45.840
by subspace of
different energies.

00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:48.320
So we're going to
work with one subspace

00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:49.480
of degenerate energies.

00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:54.750
And if I have, for example,
the operator R squared

00:43:54.750 --> 00:43:58.580
acting on any state
of that subspace,

00:43:58.580 --> 00:44:01.390
since h commutes
with L squared, h

00:44:01.390 --> 00:44:04.740
can go here, acts on this
thing, becomes a number.

00:44:04.740 --> 00:44:07.460
So you might as well
put a number here.

00:44:07.460 --> 00:44:10.440
You might as well put
a number here as well.

00:44:13.272 --> 00:44:15.370
It has to be stated like that.

00:44:15.370 --> 00:44:15.870
Carefully.

00:44:15.870 --> 00:44:18.450
We're going to work on
a degenerate subspace

00:44:18.450 --> 00:44:19.550
of some energy.

00:44:19.550 --> 00:44:24.050
But then we can treat
the h as a number.

00:44:24.050 --> 00:44:25.800
So let me say it here.

00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:38.220
We'll work in a
degenerate subspace

00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:50.080
with eigenvalues of h equal
to h prime, for h prime.

00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:56.100
Now I want to write some numbers
here to simplify my algebra.

00:44:56.100 --> 00:44:59.030
So without loss of
generality we put

00:44:59.030 --> 00:45:08.185
what this dimensionless--
this is dimensionless.

00:45:11.370 --> 00:45:13.010
I'm sorry, this is
not dimensionless.

00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:16.770
This one has units of energy.

00:45:16.770 --> 00:45:19.660
This is roughly
the right energy,

00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:24.050
with this one would be the right
energy for the ground state.

00:45:24.050 --> 00:45:26.530
Now we don't know
the energies and this

00:45:26.530 --> 00:45:28.850
is going to give us
the energies as well.

00:45:28.850 --> 00:45:31.810
So without solving the
differential equation,

00:45:31.810 --> 00:45:33.580
we're going to get the energies.

00:45:33.580 --> 00:45:36.680
So if I say, well that's
the energies you would say,

00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:38.830
come on, you're cheating.

00:45:38.830 --> 00:45:44.190
So I'll put one over nu squared
where nu can be anything.

00:45:44.190 --> 00:45:45.045
Nu is real.

00:45:47.790 --> 00:45:50.540
And that's just a
way to write things

00:45:50.540 --> 00:45:52.610
in order to simplify
the algebra.

00:45:52.610 --> 00:45:55.190
I don't know what nu is.

00:45:55.190 --> 00:45:58.180
How you say-- you don't know,
but you have this in mind

00:45:58.180 --> 00:46:00.450
and it's going to
be an integer, sure.

00:46:00.450 --> 00:46:03.030
That's what good
notation is all about.

00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:06.700
You write things and
then, you know, it's nu.

00:46:06.700 --> 00:46:10.280
You don't call it N. Because
you don't know it's an integer.

00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:14.900
You call it nu, and you proceed.

00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:18.980
So once you have
called it nu, you

00:46:18.980 --> 00:46:22.440
see here that, well, that's
what we call h really.

00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:26.240
h will be-- this h prime
is kind of not necessary.

00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:30.950
This is what-- where h
becomes in every formula.

00:46:30.950 --> 00:46:38.110
So from here you get that
minus 2h over me to the fourth

00:46:38.110 --> 00:46:41.490
is 1 over h squared nu squared.

00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:47.970
I have a minus here, I'm sorry.

00:46:47.970 --> 00:46:53.340
2h minus me to the fourth
down is h squared nu squared.

00:46:53.340 --> 00:46:58.190
So we can substitute
that in our nice formulas

00:46:58.190 --> 00:47:04.790
that hme to the fourth so
our formulas four and five

00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:08.745
have become-- I'm going
to use this blackboard.

00:47:13.370 --> 00:47:18.010
Any blackboard where I
don't have a formula boxed

00:47:18.010 --> 00:47:18.880
can be erased.

00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:20.550
So I will continue here.

00:47:28.350 --> 00:47:31.720
And so what do we have?

00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:40.240
R cross R, from that
formula, well this thing

00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:43.650
is over there minus 2h
over me to the fourth,

00:47:43.650 --> 00:47:45.090
you substitute it in here.

00:47:45.090 --> 00:47:49.680
So it's i over h
bar, one over nu

00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:53.700
squared L. Doesn't
look that bad.

00:47:53.700 --> 00:48:05.260
And, R squared is equal to 1
minus 1 over h bar nu squared.

00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:06.760
Like this.

00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:08.745
L squared plus h squared.

00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:16.204
2h, that's minus h
squared nu squared.

00:48:16.204 --> 00:48:18.180
Yeah.

00:48:18.180 --> 00:48:20.650
So these are nice formulas.

00:48:20.650 --> 00:48:24.570
These are already quite clean.

00:48:24.570 --> 00:48:27.205
We'll call them
five, equation five.

00:48:29.850 --> 00:48:37.330
I still want to rewrite
them in a way that perhaps

00:48:37.330 --> 00:48:41.380
is a little more
understandable or suggestive.

00:48:41.380 --> 00:48:45.230
I will put an h bar nu
together with each R.

00:48:45.230 --> 00:48:55.260
So h nu R cross h
nu R is equal to ih

00:48:55.260 --> 00:49:01.720
bar L. Makes it look nice.

00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:06.440
Then for this one
you'll put h squared

00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:16.150
nu squared R squared is equal
to h squared nu squared minus 1

00:49:16.150 --> 00:49:19.420
minus L squared.

00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:22.190
It's sort of trivial algebra.

00:49:22.190 --> 00:49:25.980
You multiply by h squared
nu squared, you get this.

00:49:25.980 --> 00:49:31.260
You get h squared nu squared
minus L squared because it's

00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:35.010
all multiplied minus h squared.

00:49:35.010 --> 00:49:41.370
So these two equations,
five, have become six.

00:49:41.370 --> 00:49:45.810
So five and six are
really the same equations.

00:49:45.810 --> 00:49:49.760
Nothing much has been done.

00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:55.080
And if you wish, in
terms of commutators

00:49:55.080 --> 00:50:05.590
this equation says that the
commutator h nu Ri with h nu Rj

00:50:05.590 --> 00:50:09.640
is equal to ih
bar epsilon ijkLk.

00:50:14.030 --> 00:50:22.250
H cross this thing h nu R, h nu
R cross equal iHL in components

00:50:22.250 --> 00:50:23.070
means this.

00:50:25.660 --> 00:50:28.770
That is not totally obvious.

00:50:28.770 --> 00:50:32.850
It requires a small computation,
but is the same computation

00:50:32.850 --> 00:50:35.820
that shows that
this thing is really

00:50:35.820 --> 00:50:42.420
LiLj equal ih bar epsilon ijkLk.

00:50:42.420 --> 00:50:45.850
In which these L's
have now become R's.

00:50:48.660 --> 00:50:54.430
OK so, we've cleaned
up everything.

00:50:58.970 --> 00:51:01.550
We've made great progress
even though at this moment

00:51:01.550 --> 00:51:04.745
it still looks like we haven't
solved the problem at all.

00:51:04.745 --> 00:51:07.320
But we're very close.

00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:12.510
So are there any questions
about what we've done so far?

00:51:12.510 --> 00:51:17.350
Have I lost you in the
algebra, or any goals here?

00:51:17.350 --> 00:51:18.100
Yes.

00:51:18.100 --> 00:51:21.490
AUDIENCE: Why is R cross
R not a commutation?

00:51:21.490 --> 00:51:25.440
Why would we expect that
to not be a commutation?

00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:30.480
PROFESSOR: In general, it's
the same thing as here.

00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:33.590
L cross L is this.

00:51:33.590 --> 00:51:38.380
The commutator of two Hermitian
operators is anti-Hermitian.

00:51:38.380 --> 00:51:41.600
So there's always
an i over there.

00:51:44.430 --> 00:51:45.240
Other questions?

00:51:48.232 --> 00:51:49.690
It's good, you have
to-- you should

00:51:49.690 --> 00:51:52.386
worry about those things.

00:51:52.386 --> 00:51:56.020
Are the units right, or
the right number of i's

00:51:56.020 --> 00:51:57.550
on the right hand side.

00:51:57.550 --> 00:52:01.150
That's a great way
to catch mistakes.

00:52:01.150 --> 00:52:05.050
OK so we're there.

00:52:05.050 --> 00:52:08.360
And now it should
really almost look

00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:12.490
reasonable to do what
we're going to do.

00:52:12.490 --> 00:52:15.876
h nu R with h nu R
gives you like L.

00:52:15.876 --> 00:52:20.980
So you have L with L,
form angular momentum.

00:52:20.980 --> 00:52:25.630
L and R are vectors in
their angular momentum.

00:52:25.630 --> 00:52:30.680
Now R cross R is L.
And with these units,

00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:34.570
h nu R and h nu R
looks like it has

00:52:34.570 --> 00:52:37.940
the units of angular momentum.

00:52:37.940 --> 00:52:43.290
So h nu R can be added
to angular momentum

00:52:43.290 --> 00:52:45.840
to form more angular momentum.

00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:48.100
So that's exactly what
we're going to do.

00:52:51.480 --> 00:52:54.170
So here it comes.

00:52:54.170 --> 00:52:54.820
Key step.

00:52:57.600 --> 00:53:01.580
J1-- I'm going to define
two angular momenta.

00:53:01.580 --> 00:53:04.145
Well, we hope that they
are angular momenta.

00:53:04.145 --> 00:53:18.707
L plus h nu R. And J2, one
half L minus h nu R. These

00:53:18.707 --> 00:53:19.373
are definitions.

00:53:22.490 --> 00:53:26.340
It's just defining
two operators.

00:53:26.340 --> 00:53:29.775
We hope something good
happens with these operators,

00:53:29.775 --> 00:53:32.530
but at this moment
you don't know.

00:53:32.530 --> 00:53:36.130
It's a good suggestion
because of the units

00:53:36.130 --> 00:53:37.660
match and all that stuff.

00:53:37.660 --> 00:53:44.200
So this is going to be
our definitions, seven.

00:53:44.200 --> 00:53:50.490
And from these of course follows
that L, the quantity we know,

00:53:50.490 --> 00:53:53.654
is J1 plus J2.

00:53:53.654 --> 00:53:59.360
And R, or h nu R,
is J1 minus J2.

00:54:03.750 --> 00:54:07.600
You solve in the other way.

00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:15.200
Now my first claim is
that J1 and J2 commute.

00:54:18.520 --> 00:54:19.960
Commute with each other.

00:54:28.460 --> 00:54:32.950
So these are nice,
commuting angular momenta.

00:54:32.950 --> 00:54:40.150
Now this computation has
to be done-- let me-- yeah,

00:54:40.150 --> 00:54:42.420
we can do it.

00:54:42.420 --> 00:54:45.580
J1i with J2J.

00:54:49.610 --> 00:54:53.720
It's one half and
one half gives you

00:54:53.720 --> 00:55:06.920
one quarter of Li plus h nu
Ri with LJ minus h nu RJ.

00:55:11.260 --> 00:55:15.430
Now the question
is where do I-- I

00:55:15.430 --> 00:55:17.970
think I can erase most
of this blackboard.

00:55:24.570 --> 00:55:26.300
I can leave this formula.

00:55:26.300 --> 00:55:31.445
It's kind of the only
very much needed one.

00:55:34.360 --> 00:55:38.990
So I'll continue with
this computation here.

00:55:38.990 --> 00:55:45.650
This gives me one quarter-- and
we have a big parentheses-- ih

00:55:45.650 --> 00:55:47.040
bar epsilon iJkLk.

00:55:49.700 --> 00:55:53.470
For the commutator of these two.

00:55:53.470 --> 00:56:00.680
And then you have the
commutator of the cross terms.

00:56:00.680 --> 00:56:04.320
So what do they look like?

00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:19.690
They look like minus h nu
Li with RJ, and minus h

00:56:19.690 --> 00:56:25.995
nu Ri with-- no.

00:56:31.780 --> 00:56:36.810
So I have minus h nu
Li with RJ, and now I

00:56:36.810 --> 00:56:38.720
have a plus of this term.

00:56:38.720 --> 00:56:44.565
But I will write this as a
minus h nu of LJ with Ri.

00:56:47.390 --> 00:56:50.150
Those are the two
cross products.

00:56:50.150 --> 00:56:56.827
And then finally we have this
thing, the h nu with h nu Rijk.

00:56:59.700 --> 00:57:11.914
So I have minus h nu squared,
and you have then RiRJk.

00:57:14.720 --> 00:57:18.940
No, I'll do it this way.

00:57:18.940 --> 00:57:20.290
I'm sorry.

00:57:20.290 --> 00:57:26.180
You have minus over there,
and I have this thing

00:57:26.180 --> 00:57:35.210
so it's minus ih bar epsilon
iJkLk from the last two

00:57:35.210 --> 00:57:36.230
commutators.

00:57:36.230 --> 00:57:40.445
So this one you use
essentially equation six.

00:57:43.260 --> 00:57:44.025
Now look.

00:57:47.780 --> 00:57:51.860
This thing and
this thing cancels.

00:57:51.860 --> 00:57:56.650
And these two terms, they
actually cancel as well.

00:57:56.650 --> 00:58:00.365
Because here you
get an epsilon iJR.

00:58:03.020 --> 00:58:06.560
And here there's an
epsilon Ji something.

00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:10.880
So these two terms
actually add up to zero.

00:58:10.880 --> 00:58:12.000
And this is zero.

00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:20.050
So indeed, J1i and
J2i-- 2J-- is zero.

00:58:20.050 --> 00:58:25.150
And these are commuting things.

00:58:25.150 --> 00:58:27.540
I wanted to say commuting
angular momentum,

00:58:27.540 --> 00:58:30.280
but not quite yet.

00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:33.520
Haven't shown their
angular momenta.

00:58:33.520 --> 00:58:38.520
So how do we show
their angular momenta?

00:58:38.520 --> 00:58:43.790
We have to try it and
see if they really

00:58:43.790 --> 00:58:46.660
do form an algebra
of angular momentum.

00:58:46.660 --> 00:58:53.280
So again, for saving room, I'm
going to erase this formula.

00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:55.470
It will reappear
in lecture notes.

00:58:55.470 --> 00:58:57.760
But now it should go.

00:59:03.240 --> 00:59:06.460
So the next computation is
something that I want to do.

00:59:06.460 --> 00:59:13.080
J1 cross J1 or the
J2 cross J2, to see

00:59:13.080 --> 00:59:15.590
if they form angular momenta.

00:59:15.590 --> 00:59:17.940
And I want to do
them simultaneously,

00:59:17.940 --> 00:59:26.370
so I will do one
quarter of J1 cross

00:59:26.370 --> 00:59:40.680
J2 would be L plus minus h nu
R cross L plus minus h nu R.

00:59:40.680 --> 00:59:45.680
OK that doesn't look bad at
all, especially because we

00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:50.350
have all these
formulas for products.

00:59:50.350 --> 00:59:55.500
So look, you have L
cross L, which we know.

00:59:55.500 --> 00:59:58.720
Then you have L cross
R plus R cross L

00:59:58.720 --> 01:00:01.950
that is conveniently here.

01:00:01.950 --> 01:00:08.350
And finally, you have R
cross R which is here.

01:00:08.350 --> 01:00:11.860
So it's all sort
of done in a way

01:00:11.860 --> 01:00:15.220
that the composition
should be easy.

01:00:15.220 --> 01:00:19.560
So indeed 1 over 4
L cross L gives you

01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:26.820
an ih bar L. From L
cross L. From these ones,

01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:28.910
you get plus minus
with plus minus.

01:00:28.910 --> 01:00:33.780
It's always plus but
you get another ihL.

01:00:33.780 --> 01:00:35.560
So you get another ihL.

01:00:39.070 --> 01:00:49.050
And then you get plus minus
L cross h nu R plus h nu R

01:00:49.050 --> 01:01:00.710
cross L. So here you get
one quarter of 2 ihL.

01:01:03.300 --> 01:01:08.590
And look at this formula, just
put an h nu here and h nu here

01:01:08.590 --> 01:01:10.840
and an h nu here.

01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:25.420
So you get plus minus 2 ih
from here and an h nu R.

01:01:25.420 --> 01:01:31.720
OK so the twos and the fours
and the iH's go out and then you

01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:39.652
get ih times one half
times L plus minus h nu R,

01:01:39.652 --> 01:01:46.130
which is either J1 or J2.

01:01:46.130 --> 01:01:50.810
So, very nicely,
we've shown that J1

01:01:50.810 --> 01:02:02.680
cross J1 is ih bar J1 and
J2 cross J2 is ih bar J2.

01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:09.640
And now finally you
can say that you've

01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:16.120
discovered two independent
angular momenta in the hydrogen

01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:16.840
atom.

01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:21.520
You did have an angular
momentum on an R vector,

01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:24.940
and all of our work has
gone into showing now

01:02:24.940 --> 01:02:26.855
that you have two
angular momenta.

01:02:32.430 --> 01:02:36.150
Pretty much we're
at the end of this

01:02:36.150 --> 01:02:43.620
because, after we do one more
little thing, we're there.

01:02:43.620 --> 01:02:45.255
So let me do it here.

01:02:53.987 --> 01:02:58.630
I will not need these
equations anymore.

01:02:58.630 --> 01:03:00.810
Except this one I will need.

01:03:16.900 --> 01:03:19.686
So

01:03:19.686 --> 01:03:23.580
L dot R is zero.

01:03:23.580 --> 01:03:27.740
So from L dot R
equals zero, this time

01:03:27.740 --> 01:03:37.060
you get J1 plus J2 is
equal to-- no, times--

01:03:37.060 --> 01:03:41.430
J1 minus J2 is equal to zero.

01:03:41.430 --> 01:03:45.080
Now J1 and J2 commute.

01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:48.800
So the cross terms vanish.

01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:50.410
J1 and J2 commute.

01:03:50.410 --> 01:03:55.920
So this implies that J1
squared is equal to J2 squared.

01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:10.120
Now this is a very
surprising thing.

01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:14.530
These two angular momenta
have the same length squared.

01:04:14.530 --> 01:04:18.370
Let's look a little more at
the length squared of it.

01:04:18.370 --> 01:04:21.370
So let's, for
example, square J1.

01:04:21.370 --> 01:04:33.850
Well, if I square J1, I have one
fourth L squared plus h squared

01:04:33.850 --> 01:04:36.470
nu squared R squared.

01:04:36.470 --> 01:04:42.090
No L dot R term,
because L dot R is 0.

01:04:42.090 --> 01:04:47.530
And h squared nu squared
R squared is here.

01:04:47.530 --> 01:04:49.650
So this is good news.

01:04:49.650 --> 01:04:56.150
This is one fourth L
squared plus h squared

01:04:56.150 --> 01:05:00.620
nu squared minus
1 minus L squared.

01:05:00.620 --> 01:05:03.720
The L squared cancels.

01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:09.020
And you've got that J1
equals to J2 squared.

01:05:09.020 --> 01:05:22.680
And it's equal to one fourth of
h squared nu squared minus 1.

01:05:25.625 --> 01:05:26.125
OK.

01:05:29.050 --> 01:05:31.330
Well the problem
has been solved,

01:05:31.330 --> 01:05:35.170
even if you don't
notice at this moment.

01:05:35.170 --> 01:05:37.530
It's all solved.

01:05:37.530 --> 01:05:39.490
Why?

01:05:39.490 --> 01:05:42.210
You've been talking
a degenerate subspace

01:05:42.210 --> 01:05:47.220
with angular momentum
with equal energies.

01:05:47.220 --> 01:05:50.610
And there's two
angular momenta there.

01:05:50.610 --> 01:05:54.480
And their squares equal
to the same thing.

01:05:54.480 --> 01:06:00.250
So these two angular
momenta, our squares

01:06:00.250 --> 01:06:04.800
are the same and the
square is precisely what

01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:13.390
we call h squared J times J
plus 1, where j J is quantized.

01:06:13.390 --> 01:06:19.520
It can be zero, one
half, one, all of this.

01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:23.350
So here comes a quantization.

01:06:23.350 --> 01:06:27.480
J squared being nu squared, we
didn't know what nu squared is,

01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:30.830
but it's now equal
to these things.

01:06:30.830 --> 01:06:36.490
So at this moment, things
have been quantized.

01:06:36.490 --> 01:06:41.520
And let's look into a little
more detail what has happened

01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:44.780
and confirm that we got
everything we wanted.

01:06:57.940 --> 01:07:00.680
So let me write that
equation again here.

01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:07.040
J1 squared is equal J2 squared
is equal to one quarter

01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:10.670
h squared nu squared
minus 1, which

01:07:10.670 --> 01:07:16.110
is h squared J times J plus 1.

01:07:16.110 --> 01:07:22.740
So cancel the h squares
and solve for nu squared.

01:07:22.740 --> 01:07:28.580
Nu squared would
be 1 plus 4J times

01:07:28.580 --> 01:07:36.380
J plus 1, which is 4J
squared plus 4J plus 1,

01:07:36.380 --> 01:07:39.660
which is 2J plus 1 squared.

01:07:42.810 --> 01:07:44.550
That's pretty neat.

01:07:44.550 --> 01:07:46.210
Why is it so neat?

01:07:46.210 --> 01:07:53.220
Because as J is equal to
zero, all the possible values

01:07:53.220 --> 01:07:55.860
of angular momentum--
three halves,

01:07:55.860 --> 01:08:01.780
all these things-- nu,
which is 2J plus 1,

01:08:01.780 --> 01:08:14.220
will be equal to 1, 2,
3, 4-- all the integers.

01:08:14.220 --> 01:08:17.292
And what was nu?

01:08:17.292 --> 01:08:20.609
It was the values
of the energies.

01:08:20.609 --> 01:08:26.420
So actually you've
proven the spectrum.

01:08:26.420 --> 01:08:31.420
Nu has come out to
be either 1, 2, 3,

01:08:31.420 --> 01:08:35.360
but you have all representations
of angular momentum.

01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:38.630
You have the
singlet, the spin one

01:08:38.630 --> 01:08:40.930
half-- where are the spins here?

01:08:40.930 --> 01:08:42.000
Nowhere.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.950
There was an electron,
a proton, we never

01:08:44.950 --> 01:08:47.240
put spin for the hydrogen atom.

01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:51.180
But it all shows up as
these representations

01:08:51.180 --> 01:08:53.880
in which they come along.

01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:57.740
Even more is true, as
we will see right away

01:08:57.740 --> 01:09:02.160
and confirm that everything
really shows up the right way.

01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:06.120
So what happened now?

01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:11.950
We have two independent,
equal angular momentum.

01:09:11.950 --> 01:09:16.149
So what is this degenerate
subspace we were inventing?

01:09:16.149 --> 01:09:24.000
Is the space J, which is
J1 and m1 tensor product

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:28.310
with J, which is J2
but has the same value

01:09:28.310 --> 01:09:31.029
because the squares
are the same, m2.

01:09:34.450 --> 01:09:39.350
So this is an uncoupled basis.

01:09:39.350 --> 01:09:45.000
Uncoupled basis of states
in the degenerate subspace.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:50.720
And now, you know, it's
all a little surreal

01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:55.350
because these don't look
like our states at all.

01:09:55.350 --> 01:09:58.780
But this is the way
algebraically they show up.

01:09:58.780 --> 01:10:05.260
We choose our value of J, we
have then that nu is equal

01:10:05.260 --> 01:10:09.270
to this and for that value of
J there's some values of m's.

01:10:09.270 --> 01:10:13.470
And therefore, this must
be the degenerate subspace.

01:10:13.470 --> 01:10:17.890
So this is nothing
but the tensor product

01:10:17.890 --> 01:10:22.220
of a J multiplet
with a J multiplet.

01:10:25.430 --> 01:10:29.120
Where J is that integer here.

01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:32.400
And what is the tensor
product of a J multiplet?

01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:35.200
First, J is for J1.

01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:37.487
The second J is for J2.

01:10:44.230 --> 01:10:46.220
So at this moment
of course we're

01:10:46.220 --> 01:10:51.680
calling this N for
the quantum number.

01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:53.250
But what is this thing?

01:10:53.250 --> 01:11:01.850
This is 2J plus 2J minus
1 plus-- all the way

01:11:01.850 --> 01:11:02.810
up to the singlet.

01:11:08.430 --> 01:11:12.620
But what are these
representations of?

01:11:12.620 --> 01:11:17.190
Well here we have
J1 and here is J2.

01:11:17.190 --> 01:11:19.790
These must be the
ones of the sum.

01:11:19.790 --> 01:11:22.640
But who is the sum, L?

01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:27.640
So these are the L
representations that you get.

01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:29.850
L is your angular momentum.

01:11:29.850 --> 01:11:32.410
L representations.

01:11:32.410 --> 01:11:39.520
And if 2J plus 1 is N,
you got a representation

01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:46.170
with L equals N minus
1, because 2J plus 1

01:11:46.170 --> 01:11:57.190
is N, L equals N minus 2,
all the way up to L equals 0.

01:11:57.190 --> 01:12:04.780
Therefore, you get precisely
this whole structure.

01:12:04.780 --> 01:12:09.870
So, just in time as
we get to 2 o'clock,

01:12:09.870 --> 01:12:13.520
we've finished the quantization
of the hydrogen atom.

01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:16.340
We've finished 805.

01:12:16.340 --> 01:12:17.560
I hope you enjoyed.

01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:21.820
I did a lot. [INAUDIBLE]
and Will did, too.

01:12:21.820 --> 01:12:25.440
Good luck and
we'll see you soon.
