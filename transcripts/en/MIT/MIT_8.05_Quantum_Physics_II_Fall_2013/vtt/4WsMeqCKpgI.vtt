BARTON ZWIEBACH: [INAUDIBLE]
of today's lecture

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:28.220
is coherent states of
the harmonic oscillator.

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.860
So let me begin by telling
you about some things

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:40.730
we've learned in the last
lecture, and here they are.

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:46.080
We learned how to calculate the
so-called Heisenberg operators.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.480
Remember, if you have
a Schrodinger operator,

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.710
you subject it to
this transformation

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.070
with a unitary operator.

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.880
That creates time evolution
and that gives you

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.980
the Heisenberg operator.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.319
We learned things about
Heisenberg expectation values.

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:09.710
If the Hamiltonian is
time independent, h, time

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.550
independent, the
formula is quite simple

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.180
and gives you the Heisenberg
operator at the later time.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.650
So we did this.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.970
We found, in fact,
Heisenberg operators

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.760
satisfy equations of motion.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.960
And we calculated the
Heisenberg operators

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.260
for the harmonic oscillator.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.430
That was our main
achievement last time,

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.410
a formula for the time
development of the x

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.830
and p operators in the
Heisenberg picture.

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:50.680
And that really contains all
the information of the dynamics,

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:56.000
as you will see today, when
we will be using this stuff.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.242
Now, I suggested that you
read-- and you may do it later.

00:02:02.242 --> 00:02:03.700
There's no need
that you've done it

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.560
for today-- the
information on the time

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.980
development of the creation
and annihilation operators.

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:18.340
You see, the a and a dagger are
different inverses of x and p,

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:19.880
are linear combinations.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.450
So the a and the
a dagger operators

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.776
also can be further
Schrodinger operators

00:02:26.776 --> 00:02:29.530
that have no time dependence.

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.150
And suddenly, if you go
to the Heisenberg picture,

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.290
the creation and
annihilation operators

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.240
become time dependent operators.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.700
So that's in the notes.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.070
You can read about it.

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:49.070
So we define the time
dependent operator, a hat,

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.470
to be the Heisenberg
version of a hat.

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.100
And you're supposed
to do a calculation

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:03.770
and try it or read it, and
the answer is very nice,

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.030
simply a phase dependence.

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:12.450
The a is a at time equals
0, the Schrodinger 1 times

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.550
e to the minus i omega t.

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:21.470
Then a dagger is just
what you would expect,

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:27.330
the dagger of this, which the
face has an opposite sign and a

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.660
becomes a dagger.

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:35.160
Finally, if you
substitute this a and a

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.920
daggers in this formula.

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.640
For example, you
could say x Heisenberg

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.450
is a Heisenberg plus
a dagger Heisenberg.

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.640
And you substitute those
Heisenberg values there,

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.780
you will obtain this.

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.200
Same for the momentum.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.280
If you put Heisenberg,
Heisenberg, Heisenberg,

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.880
remember, if you have an
equality of Schrodinger

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.230
operators, it also
holds when you

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.270
put Heisenberg in
every operator.

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:07.180
And therefore, if you
put the Heisenberg a, a,

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.940
and use those values, you
will recover this equation.

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:17.640
So in a sense, these equations
are equivalent to these ones.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.370
And that's basically
our situation.

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.550
This is what we've
learned so far,

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:35.480
and our goal today is to
apply this to understand

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.660
coherent states of the
harmonic oscillator.

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.570
Now, why do we
want to understand

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.400
coherent states of the
harmonic oscillator?

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.550
You want to understand coherent
states because the energy

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:53.150
eigenstates are
extraordinarily quantum.

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.720
The energy eigenstates of
the harmonic oscillator

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.600
don't look at all-- and
you've seen the expectation

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.120
value of the position.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.350
It's time independent.

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:05.710
It just doesn't change.

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:11.030
Expectation value of any
operator in a stationary state

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:12.400
is a constant.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.730
It just doesn't change.

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:19.295
So you have any eigenstate,
any energy eigenstate

00:05:19.295 --> 00:05:21.680
of the harmonic
oscillator, you ask,

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.660
what is the position
of this particle doing?

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:25.230
Nothing.

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:27.680
What is the momentum
of this particle doing?

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.520
Nothing.

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.230
So nevertheless, of course,
it's an interesting state,

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:38.770
but we want to construct
quantum mechanical states that

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.630
behave a little like the
classical states we're

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:43.830
accustomed to.

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:48.100
And that's what
coherent states do.

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:51.260
We'll have an application
of coherent states

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.710
to light, photons,
coherent photons.

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:55.580
What are they?

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.880
We'll see it later this week.

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.200
So that's the reason we want
to understand coherent states,

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:07.640
because we want some
states that in some ways

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:12.980
behave classically, or
close to classically.

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:15.640
So they have many
applications, these states,

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:20.350
and you will see some
of them in this lecture.

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:24.430
I'm going to try to keep this
blackboard there, untouched,

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:26.336
so that we can refer
to these equations.

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:47.540
So our first step is considering
translation operators.

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:51.740
So let's consider the
unitary translation operator.

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:59.600
So translation operators.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:06.580
So this translation operator
that I will write as T sub x0

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:10.590
will be defined to be
the exponential of e

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:18.090
to the minus i p
hat x0 over h bar.

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:20.565
You have seen such
operators before.

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:27.380
We've seen a lot of
them in the homework.

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:30.770
So first of all,
why is it unitary?

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:43.655
well, it's unitary because x0
is supposed to be a real number.

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:49.650
p is Hermitian.

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:52.565
Therefore, this with
the i is anti-Hermitian,

00:07:52.565 --> 00:07:55.580
and an exponential of
anti-Hermitian operator

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:57.940
is unitary.

00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:01.710
Now, it has, actually,
a very simple property.

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:09.585
The multiplication of two
of those operators is what?

00:08:09.585 --> 00:08:14.130
Well, you have an exponential,
e to the minus ipx0,

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:17.790
and an exponential followed,
e to the minus ipy0.

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:24.120
Now, if you're well
trained in 805,

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:27.850
you should get a little
nervous for a second

00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:30.610
because you don't know,
can I treat it easily?

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:33.690
And then you relax and say,
yes, these two operators,

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:38.929
whatsoever the numbers here,
this with another one with a y0

00:08:38.929 --> 00:08:40.360
would commute.

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:44.260
Therefore, they can be put
together in the exponential,

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.440
and this is T of x0 plus y0.

00:08:54.840 --> 00:09:00.000
No combo Baker-Hausdorff
needed here.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.140
It's just straightforward.

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:11.440
So what is Tx0 dagger?

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:14.610
T x0 dagger, if you
take the dagger,

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:19.580
you change this i for
a minus i, so it's

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:23.920
exactly the same as
changing the sign of x0.

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:29.630
So this is T of minus x0.

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:35.430
And by this identity, T
of minus x0 with a T of x0

00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:39.830
would be T of 0, which
is the unit operator.

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:47.800
So T of minus x0 is
the inverse of T of x0,

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:53.082
confirming that the
operator is unitary.

00:09:53.082 --> 00:09:55.600
The inverse is the dagger.

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:03.040
So I used here that
this is the inverse

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:08.860
because T minus x0 times T
x0 is T of 0 is equal to 1.

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:13.980
So I could mention here, T of 0
is equal to the unit operator.

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:21.170
So these are our
translation operators,

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:23.570
but you don't get
the intuition of what

00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:27.210
they do unless you
compute a little more.

00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:30.700
And a little more than you
should compute is this.

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:36.960
What is T x0 dagger x T x0?

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:49.610
And what is T x0 dagger p T x0?

00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:58.300
Now, why do we ask for
these particular things?

00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:02.410
Why don't I ask, what is
x hat multiplied by T x0?

00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:04.180
Why do I ask this?

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:07.660
It is because an operator
acting on an operator

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:08.820
always does this.

00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:12.490
If you say an operator is
acting on another operator,

00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:14.580
the first operator
that is acting,

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:16.720
you put it here
with its inverse.

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:20.420
It happens to be unitary,
so you put the dagger,

00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:23.750
and you put the operator here.

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:26.580
And this is the
right thing to do.

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:30.200
It has a simple answer and
a simple interpretation,

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:31.190
as we'll see now.

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:35.910
So what is T, this
commutator, supposed to be?

00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:40.220
Well, you can probably
imagine what this is.

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:42.220
You've calculated
it in homework,

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:44.960
so I will not do it again.

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:48.470
This is x plus x0.

00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:54.080
So you get the operator, x,
plus x0 times the unit operator.

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:57.490
That was done before.

00:11:57.490 --> 00:12:03.730
And here, you get just p.

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:04.360
Why?

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:08.690
Because p hat is
the only operator

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:13.880
that exists in this translation
thing, so p commutes with p.

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:19.110
So these two operators commute
and the T tagger hits the T,

00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:21.960
and it's equal to 1, so
that's a simple thing.

00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:30.400
So why is this reasonable?

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:34.160
It's because of the
following situation.

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:40.840
If you have a state, psi,
you can ask, for example,

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:46.120
what is the expectation
value of x in the state psi?

00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:54.970
And if this state
represents a particle that

00:12:54.970 --> 00:13:01.610
is sitting somewhere here,
roughly, the expectation value

00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:05.860
of x is basically
that vector that

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:09.190
tells you where the particle is.

00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:16.260
So you could ask, then,
what is the expectation

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:21.560
value of x in the
state T x0 psi?

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:33.690
So you want to know,
what does T x0 really do?

00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:38.330
Here, it seems to say
something, takes the operator

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:41.440
and displaces it, but
that seems abstract.

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:46.530
If you ask this question,
this seems more physical.

00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:50.470
You had a state, you act with
an operator, it's another state.

00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:52.350
How does it look?

00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:58.140
Well, this expectation value
would be the expectation value

00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:07.470
of x on T x0 psi,
and the [? brau ?]

00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:11.240
would be psi T x0 dagger.

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:17.280
So actually, that
expectation value

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:22.220
builds precisely
this combination,

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:24.660
and that's why it's meaningful.

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:38.790
And since you know what this
is, this is psi x plus x0 psi.

00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:41.910
This is equal to the
expectation value

00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:50.150
of x in the original
state plus x0 times 1.

00:14:53.510 --> 00:15:00.790
So the expectation value of x
in the new state, the x0 psi,

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:05.920
is the expectation value of
x in the old state plus x0.

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:12.050
So indeed, if this is x, you
could do this for vectors,

00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:15.100
and here is x0.

00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:22.680
Well, the expectation value of
x in the new state, the T x0

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:28.800
operator, took the state and
moved it by a displacement x0

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:33.840
so that the new expectation
value is the old one plus x0.

00:15:37.450 --> 00:15:42.320
So that's physically why
these things are relevant.

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:49.420
A couple of other things
you've shown in the homework,

00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:56.900
and you could retry doing them,
is that T x0 on the x state,

00:15:56.900 --> 00:16:04.050
by this intuition, should
be the x plus x0 state.

00:16:04.050 --> 00:16:07.810
It moves the state to the right.

00:16:07.810 --> 00:16:18.745
And if psi has a wave
function, psi of x, T x0 of psi

00:16:18.745 --> 00:16:24.180
has a wave function,
psi of x minus x0,

00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:27.860
since you know that
psi of x minus x0

00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:33.300
is the wave function
translated by x0 to the right.

00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:35.480
The sign is always
the opposite one.

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:37.930
When you write
psi of x minus x0,

00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:42.600
the function has been
moved to the right x0.

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:48.410
So this is our whole
discussion and reminder

00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:52.480
of what the translation
operators are.

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:55.170
So we've got our
translation operator.

00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:57.670
Let's see how we can use it.

00:16:57.670 --> 00:17:01.880
And we'll use it to define
the coherent states.

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:05.715
So here comes the definition
of what the coherent state is.

00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:12.069
It's a beginning definition,
or a working definition,

00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:16.250
until we understand it enough
that we can generalize it.

00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:18.400
By the time we
finish the lecture,

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:23.329
this definition will be
generalized in a very nice way,

00:17:23.329 --> 00:17:25.829
in a very elegant way.

00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:28.975
So coherent states.

00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:37.480
So here it goes.

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:43.010
I'm going to take the
vacuum state of the harmonic

00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:46.840
oscillator, the ground state
of the harmonic oscillator,

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:54.430
and simply displace it with
a translation operator by x0.

00:17:54.430 --> 00:18:04.260
So this is going to be e to the
minus i p hat x0 over h bar 0.

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:06.680
And I want a name
for this state,

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:09.190
and that's the worst part of it.

00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:11.590
There's no great name for it.

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:19.000
I don't know if any
notation is very good.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.760
If it's very good,
it's cumbersome,

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:25.890
so I'll write it like this.

00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:27.230
A little misleading.

00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:30.510
I'll put a tilde over the state.

00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:32.490
You could say it's
a tilde over the x,

00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:34.430
but it really,
morally speaking, is

00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:36.480
a tilde over the whole state.

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:40.440
It means that this
thing, you should

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:44.820
read there's an x0 here used for
the translation operator that

00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:46.480
appears here.

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:50.770
So that's the state, x tilde 0.

00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:54.100
Intuitively, you
know what it is.

00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:57.450
You have the harmonic
oscillator potential.

00:18:57.450 --> 00:18:58.910
Here is x.

00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:02.640
The ground state is some
wave function like that.

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:07.670
This state has been
moved to position x0,

00:19:07.670 --> 00:19:11.880
and presumably some sort
of wave function like that,

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:15.670
because this translates
the wave function.

00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:19.900
So the ground state moves
it up there to the right.

00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:21.260
That's what it is.

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:23.240
That's a coherent state.

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:27.800
And there's no time
dependence here so far,

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:31.020
so this is the state at
some instant of time.

00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:34.580
The coherent state, maybe
call it at time equals zero.

00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:38.850
Let's leave time frozen
for a little while

00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:41.640
until we understand
what this state does.

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:45.190
Then we'll put the time back.

00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:48.475
So a few remarks on this.

00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:58.085
x0 x0 is how much?

00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:07.670
Now, don't think these
are position eigenstates.

00:20:07.670 --> 00:20:09.380
That's a possible mistake.

00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:13.550
That's not a
position eigenstate.

00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:16.780
This is a coherent state.

00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:18.680
If these would be
position eigenstate,

00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:21.220
you say delta of
this minus that,

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:24.890
but it's nothing
to do with that.

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:27.840
Can you tell without
doing any computation what

00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:29.330
is this number?

00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:30.890
How much should be?

00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:31.650
Yes?

00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:32.587
AUDIENCE: 1.

00:20:32.587 --> 00:20:33.920
BARTON ZWIEBACH: It should be 1.

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:34.440
Why?

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:38.630
Because it's a unitary
operator acting on this thing,

00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:40.160
so it preserve length.

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:44.100
So this should be equal
to 0 0, should be 1.

00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:46.680
Very good.

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:48.550
No need to do the computation.

00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:50.710
It's just 1.

00:20:50.710 --> 00:21:02.260
Psi associated to this state is
the ground state wave function

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:04.380
at x minus x0.

00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:14.435
Where this refers to the wave
function, x0 is psi 0 of x.

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:20.400
So this is what I
was saying here.

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:22.830
The wave function
has been translated

00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:27.670
to x0, the remark over there.

00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:33.450
So these are our
coherent states and we

00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:39.240
want to understand the first
few basic things about them

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:42.435
so we can do the following
simple computations.

00:21:51.130 --> 00:21:53.540
So if I have to
do the following,

00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:55.500
if I have to compute
the expectation

00:21:55.500 --> 00:22:04.850
value of any operator,
A, on a coherent state,

00:22:04.850 --> 00:22:09.180
I use the fact that I want
to go back to the vacuum,

00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:15.820
so I put T x0 dagger A T x0 0.

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:25.360
Because that way, I trace back
to what the vacuum is doing.

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:29.840
It's much easier to do that than
to try to calculate something

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:31.250
from scratch.

00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:46.830
So for example, we have
here that x0 x x0, well, you

00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:53.090
would replace it by T x T,
T dagger x T, which you know

00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:56.140
is x hat plus x0.

00:22:56.140 --> 00:23:03.960
We calculated it a few
seconds ago, top blackboard.

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:07.570
And therefore, you got
what is the expectation

00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:10.800
value of x on the ground state?

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:13.210
x0, very good.

00:23:13.210 --> 00:23:18.560
And therefore, we just got x0,
which is what you would expect.

00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:23.100
The expectation value of x
on the coherent state is x0.

00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:24.270
You're there.

00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:26.410
You've been displaced.

00:23:26.410 --> 00:23:37.080
How about the
momentum, x0 p hat x0?

00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:43.430
Well, p acted by the translation
operator is unchanged.

00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:49.570
Therefore, we got 0 p 0, and
again that 0, so this state

00:23:49.570 --> 00:23:53.330
still has no momentum.

00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:57.860
It represents a T equals 0,
a state that is over here.

00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:02.780
And just by looking at it,
it's just sitting there,

00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:05.140
has no momentum whatsoever.

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:11.310
Another question
that is interesting,

00:24:11.310 --> 00:24:16.201
what is the expectation
value of the Hamiltonian

00:24:16.201 --> 00:24:18.010
on the coherent state?

00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:28.640
Well, this should be, now
you imagine in your head,

00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:37.350
T dagger H T. Now, H
is p squared over 2m,

00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:41.800
and that p squared
over 2m gets unchanged.

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:49.520
p squared over 2m is not changed
because T dagger and T does

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:53.330
nothing to it, T dagger
from the left, T.

00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:54.120
Nevertheless.

00:24:54.120 --> 00:25:01.240
the Hamiltonian has a 1/2
m omega squared x hat,

00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:06.960
and x hat is changed by
becoming x hat plus x0.

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:20.840
Well, we don't want to
compute too hard, do

00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:22.280
too much effort here.

00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:26.920
So first, we realize that
here's the p squared over 2m

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:31.070
and here's the m omega squared
x hat squared, so that's

00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:32.980
the whole Hamiltonian.

00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:44.500
So we got 0 H 0 plus the
extra terms that come here.

00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:46.720
But what terms come here?

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:54.250
There's a product of an x0
and an x between 0 and 0.

00:25:54.250 --> 00:26:01.220
x0 is a number, so you have an
x between 0 and 0, and that's 0.

00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:05.810
So the cross product here won't
contribute to the expectation

00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:10.240
value, so the last term
that is there is 1/2 m

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:16.310
is a number omega
squared, x0 squared.

00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:18.200
And what is the
expectation value

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:19.890
of the Hamiltonian
on the vacuum?

00:26:19.890 --> 00:26:28.450
It's h omega over 2 plus 1/2
m omega squared, x0 squared.

00:26:28.450 --> 00:26:35.000
And you start seeing
classical behavior.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.400
The expectation value of
the energy at this point

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:44.840
is a little quantum
thing plus the whole cost

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:49.080
of stretching something
all the way to x0.

00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:57.690
1/2 of k squared, k for
the oscillator, x0 squared.

00:26:57.690 --> 00:27:02.500
So the energy of this thing is
quite reasonably approximated,

00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:07.250
if x0 is large enough,
by the second term,

00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:09.870
and this is the cost
of energy of having

00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:13.450
a particle of the potential.

00:27:13.450 --> 00:27:16.280
So it's behaving in
a reasonable way.

00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:26.910
You can do a couple more
little exercises that I'll

00:27:26.910 --> 00:27:35.613
put here as things
for you to check.

00:27:35.613 --> 00:27:36.113
Exercise.

00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:44.770
x0 tilde x squared x0 tilde.

00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:48.330
Just calculate.

00:27:48.330 --> 00:27:51.250
It's just useful to have.

00:27:51.250 --> 00:27:56.650
x0 squared plus h
bar over 2m omega.

00:27:56.650 --> 00:28:09.290
And x0 tilde p squared x0
tilde is mh omega over 2.

00:28:09.290 --> 00:28:21.535
And finally, x0 tilde xp plus
px x0 tilde is equal to 0.

00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:31.520
Any questions?

00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:34.580
These are exercises
for you to practice

00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:36.072
a little these
expectation values.

00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:40.700
Questions on what
we've done so far?

00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:42.254
Yes?

00:28:42.254 --> 00:28:44.739
AUDIENCE: You said
these coherent states is

00:28:44.739 --> 00:28:47.224
most significant only
in the ground state,

00:28:47.224 --> 00:28:53.964
or is it also important to
use them for [INAUDIBLE]?

00:28:56.770 --> 00:29:01.770
BARTON ZWIEBACH: Well, we've
defined the coherent state

00:29:01.770 --> 00:29:05.110
by taking the ground
state and moving it,

00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:07.420
and these are
particularly interesting.

00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:10.800
You could try to figure out what
would happen if you would take

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:13.320
an excited state
and you move it.

00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:16.410
Things are a little
more complicated.

00:29:16.410 --> 00:29:18.360
PROFESSOR: And in a
sense, they can all

00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:21.790
be understood in terms of what
we do to the ground state.

00:29:21.790 --> 00:29:25.190
So we will not focus
on them too much.

00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:27.860
In a sense, you will
see when we generalize

00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:33.430
this how what we're doing
is very special, in at least

00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:35.660
one simple way.

00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:41.040
So we'll always focus on
translating the grounds.

00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:43.560
Other questions?

00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:44.690
Yes.

00:29:44.690 --> 00:29:47.180
AUDIENCE: Where does the
term [INAUDIBLE] arise

00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:50.120
and why does it
persevere [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:54.940
PROFESSOR: OK, here is the
thing of the coherent state.

00:29:54.940 --> 00:30:00.000
Is this an energy
eigenstate at this moment?

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.030
What do you think?

00:30:01.030 --> 00:30:06.090
Is this an energy eigenstate--
this state over here?

00:30:06.090 --> 00:30:09.250
No, it won't be an
energy eigenstate.

00:30:09.250 --> 00:30:11.050
There's something
funny about it.

00:30:11.050 --> 00:30:15.010
Energy eigenstates are
always diffuse things.

00:30:15.010 --> 00:30:18.050
They never look like that.

00:30:18.050 --> 00:30:19.970
So this is not an
energy eigenstate,

00:30:19.970 --> 00:30:22.820
and you've done things with
non-energy eigenstates.

00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:25.430
They change shape.

00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:28.950
As they evolve,
they change shape.

00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:32.160
What we will see very
soon is that this state,

00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:37.170
if we let it go, it will
start moving back and forth

00:30:37.170 --> 00:30:39.630
without changing shape.

00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:43.450
It's going to do
an amazing thing.

00:30:43.450 --> 00:30:46.120
Energy eigenstates-- you're
super-close to energy

00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:46.870
eigenstates.

00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:50.710
You get something that changes
in time and the shape changes,

00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:53.210
and you've even done
problems like that.

00:30:53.210 --> 00:30:58.620
But this state is so
exceptional that even

00:30:58.620 --> 00:31:01.815
as we let it go in time,
it's going to change,

00:31:01.815 --> 00:31:05.740
but the shape is not
going to spread out.

00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:08.440
Do you remember when
you considered a pulse

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:13.270
in a free particle, how it
disappears and stretches away?

00:31:13.270 --> 00:31:15.460
Well, in the
harmonic oscillator,

00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:19.340
this has been so well prepared
that this thing, as time goes

00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:23.660
by, will just move and
oscillate like a particle.

00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:26.350
And it does so coherently.

00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:28.430
It doesn't change shape.

00:31:28.430 --> 00:31:32.780
When we talk about
light, coherent light

00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:34.610
is what you get from lasers.

00:31:34.610 --> 00:31:36.500
And so if you want
understand lasers,

00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:38.230
you have to understand
coherent states.

00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:46.140
OK, so this brings us
there to time evolution.

00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:48.376
So let's do time evolution.

00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:06.760
So what will happen?

00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:16.440
We'll have a state x0
goes to x0 comma t.

00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:17.880
So that's the notation.

00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:23.530
That's what we'll mean by
the state at a later time.

00:32:23.530 --> 00:32:26.510
And how are we going
to explore this?

00:32:26.510 --> 00:32:30.290
Well, we're all set with our
Heisenberg operator, there.

00:32:30.290 --> 00:32:33.410
We'll take expectation
values of things

00:32:33.410 --> 00:32:36.420
to figure out how things look.

00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:39.300
So what do we have here?

00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:46.550
We'll ask for X0 t, and we'll
put the Schrodinger operator

00:32:46.550 --> 00:32:50.910
in between here--
X0 t, and this is

00:32:50.910 --> 00:32:54.760
what we'll call the
expectation value of A

00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:58.230
as time goes by
in the X0 0 state.

00:33:01.510 --> 00:33:03.120
This is what we call this.

00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:06.720
But then, we have
the time evolution.

00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:14.320
So this is equal to the original
state, Heisenberg operator

00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:17.785
of A-- original state.

00:33:21.650 --> 00:33:26.460
And if you wish, you could
then put the t operator--

00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:30.280
as we have in the top
blackboard to the right--

00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:32.130
and reduce it even more.

00:33:32.130 --> 00:33:37.930
But we've computed a lot of
this coherent state expectation

00:33:37.930 --> 00:33:41.510
value, so let's
leave it like that.

00:33:41.510 --> 00:33:44.810
So you could, if
you wish, say this

00:33:44.810 --> 00:33:56.970
is equal to 0-- T
X0 dagger A T X0 0.

00:33:56.970 --> 00:34:01.080
So you can ultimately reduce
the expectation values

00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:02.810
of things on the vacuum.

00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:07.680
So OK, we're all set.

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:09.125
Let's try to do one.

00:34:17.210 --> 00:34:19.960
And the reason this
is a nice calculation

00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:21.820
is that the time
evolution of this state

00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:23.370
is a little complicated.

00:34:23.370 --> 00:34:26.540
We'll figure it out
later, but it's easier

00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:28.449
to work with the
time evolved state.

00:34:28.449 --> 00:34:31.820
So here it goes-- what
is the expectation

00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:40.120
value of X as a function
of time on the X0 state?

00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:45.620
Well, it says here
take the X0 state,

00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:49.739
and take the
Heisenberg value of X.

00:34:49.739 --> 00:34:56.960
So we have it up there-- X
hat cosine omega t plus b hat

00:34:56.960 --> 00:35:03.260
over M omega sine omega t X0.

00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:06.630
Forget about time evolution
of the coherent states.

00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:09.240
We evolved the operator.

00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:13.510
On the other hand, we have
that the expectation value of p

00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:19.090
is 0 in the coherent state,
and the expectation value of X

00:35:19.090 --> 00:35:20.980
is X0.

00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:27.760
So end of story-- calculation
over-- X0 cosine of omega t.

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:30.630
That's expectation
value in time.

00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:32.806
This thing is
oscillating classically.

00:35:36.110 --> 00:35:39.300
That's nice as can be.

00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:46.720
So classical behavior
again, of a quantum state.

00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:55.690
How about expectation
value of p X0 of t?

00:35:55.690 --> 00:35:58.535
If it's oscillating,
it better be moving,

00:35:58.535 --> 00:36:00.720
and it better have
some momentum.

00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:04.430
So let's put the
momentum operator here,

00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:07.110
the Heisenberg one.

00:36:07.110 --> 00:36:14.500
So we'll have p hat cosine
omega t minus m omega x

00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:22.160
hat sine omega t X0 tilde.

00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:27.080
And this is 0, but
X has X0 there,

00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:35.510
so minus m omega X0
sine of omega t, which

00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:46.110
is equal to m d dt of the
expectation value of X.

00:36:46.110 --> 00:36:50.430
Here it is-- expectation
value of X. m d dt of that

00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:53.900
is minus m omega
X0 sine omega t.

00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:57.220
That's what it should be.

00:36:57.220 --> 00:37:00.760
And this thing is really
oscillating classically--

00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:04.330
not only the exposition, but
the momentum is doing that.

00:37:07.130 --> 00:37:09.750
Now, the other thing
that we can compute--

00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:15.650
and we want to compute--
is the key thing.

00:37:15.650 --> 00:37:17.110
You have this state.

00:37:17.110 --> 00:37:20.420
We said it's coherent evolution.

00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:23.800
So the ground
state is this state

00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:27.190
that is a minimum
uncertainty packet.

00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:31.800
It has a delta X uncertainty
mix and a delta p.

00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:37.280
Their product saturates the
uncertainty in equality.

00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:41.710
And when we move the state
X0, well, the delta X

00:37:41.710 --> 00:37:42.650
will be the same.

00:37:42.650 --> 00:37:45.970
The delta p will be the
same, and it's that.

00:37:45.970 --> 00:37:49.730
But now as it starts
to move, we want

00:37:49.730 --> 00:37:52.630
to see if the shape
is kept the same.

00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:56.100
Maybe it fattens up,
and shrinks down,

00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:58.770
and does things in the middle.

00:37:58.770 --> 00:38:02.200
So the issue of
coherency of this state

00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:07.270
is the issue whether the
uncertainties remain the same.

00:38:07.270 --> 00:38:09.670
If the uncertainties
remain the same,

00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:13.070
and they are saturated--
the product is saturating

00:38:13.070 --> 00:38:17.700
the inequality, you know that
the shape has to be Gaussian,

00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:22.210
and it must be the same
shape that is running around.

00:38:22.210 --> 00:38:28.570
So what we need to compute
is the uncertainty in X,

00:38:28.570 --> 00:38:29.800
for example.

00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:42.130
So how do delta X of t
and delta p of p behave?

00:38:45.610 --> 00:38:48.220
That's our question.

00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:50.305
And let's see how they do.

00:38:54.210 --> 00:38:57.060
Well, we have this
computation-- actually,

00:38:57.060 --> 00:38:59.640
if you don't have the
Heisenberg picture,

00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:02.930
it's kind of a nightmare.

00:39:02.930 --> 00:39:07.450
With the Heisenberg
picture, it's a lot easier.

00:39:07.450 --> 00:39:12.250
Delta x squared of t
would be the expectation

00:39:12.250 --> 00:39:21.120
value of X0 t of
X squared, X0 t,

00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:30.790
minus the expectation value
of X0 t X, X0 t squared.

00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:39.396
I wrote what the definition
of the uncertainty squared is.

00:39:39.396 --> 00:39:43.450
It's the expectation value
of the operator squared,

00:39:43.450 --> 00:39:46.330
minus the square
of the expectation

00:39:46.330 --> 00:39:49.250
value of the operator.

00:39:49.250 --> 00:39:52.390
And of course, everything
is going to turn Heisenberg

00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:57.490
immediately, so this thing--
maybe I can go one more

00:39:57.490 --> 00:40:08.070
line here-- would be X0 X
Heisenberg squared of t,

00:40:08.070 --> 00:40:16.170
X0 minus-- this is simple--
this we've calculated.

00:40:16.170 --> 00:40:20.010
it's that expectation
value at the top

00:40:20.010 --> 00:40:23.530
is the expectation
value of X in time.

00:40:23.530 --> 00:40:24.250
It's that.

00:40:24.250 --> 00:40:29.650
So this is minus X0 squared
cosine squared of omega t.

00:40:37.950 --> 00:40:39.680
So what do we have to do?

00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:42.670
We have to focus on this term.

00:40:45.860 --> 00:40:50.960
So this term is equal to X0.

00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:53.430
And you have X
Heisenberg squared,

00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:57.590
so let's do it-- X
squared cosine squared

00:40:57.590 --> 00:41:04.550
omega t plus p
hat squared over m

00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:12.810
squared w squared sine
squared omega t plus 1

00:41:12.810 --> 00:41:28.240
over mw cosine omega t sine
omega t X p plus pX X0 tilde.

00:41:32.290 --> 00:41:36.500
That shows that term, and
I just squared that thing,

00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:41.260
but that I suggested
a few exercises here.

00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:44.340
This is 0.

00:41:44.340 --> 00:41:48.770
In fact, it's 0 in the ground
state as well, so this is 0.

00:41:51.850 --> 00:41:57.410
X squared gives you
the top equation--

00:41:57.410 --> 00:42:05.420
X0 squared plus h bar
over 2 m omega cosine

00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:21.040
squared omega t-- plus p squared
over m squared w squared,

00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:25.730
so p squared is
m h omega over 2.

00:42:25.730 --> 00:42:28.590
And then you have
m squared omega

00:42:28.590 --> 00:42:31.860
squared sine squared omega t.

00:42:35.590 --> 00:42:38.470
And that's this whole term.

00:42:38.470 --> 00:42:41.020
And the thing that
we're supposed to do

00:42:41.020 --> 00:42:45.370
is subtract this here.

00:42:45.370 --> 00:42:51.210
You see that the X0 squared
cosine squared of omega t

00:42:51.210 --> 00:42:52.130
cancels here.

00:42:56.790 --> 00:42:58.810
So what do we get?

00:42:58.810 --> 00:43:03.680
h bar over 2 mw cosine
squared omega t.

00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:13.980
But this thing is also h bar
over 2 mw sine squared omega t.

00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:16.890
So this whole
thing, all the times

00:43:16.890 --> 00:43:20.840
have disappeared--
delta X squared--

00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:24.410
the time dependence here
has disappeared with that,

00:43:24.410 --> 00:43:28.090
and the cosine squared with
sine squared have combined,

00:43:28.090 --> 00:43:33.050
and you get h bar
over 2 m omega, which

00:43:33.050 --> 00:43:38.500
was-- this is, I'm sorry, of t.

00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:41.000
We work very hard
to put the t there.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:42.970
We should leave it.

00:43:42.970 --> 00:43:48.080
The uncertainty as a function
of time has not changed.

00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:52.160
It is the original uncertainty
of the ground state.

00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:55.030
So this is moving in a nice way.

00:43:55.030 --> 00:44:00.790
You're supposed to compute now
as well the uncertainty in p.

00:44:00.790 --> 00:44:04.050
I leave that as an
exercise-- delta

00:44:04.050 --> 00:44:14.180
p squared of t equal
m h bar omega over 2.

00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:15.290
So this is an exercise.

00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:22.560
Practice with coherent states.

00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:24.520
It's worth doing it, I think.

00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:27.170
Actually there's going to
be a problem in the homework

00:44:27.170 --> 00:44:31.570
set, in which you're going to
ask to do most of these things,

00:44:31.570 --> 00:44:33.970
including things I'm doing
here on the blackboard.

00:44:33.970 --> 00:44:37.350
So you will practice this.

00:44:37.350 --> 00:44:46.230
So between these two, delta
p, delta X-- delta X of t,

00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:52.760
delta p of t is, in fact,
equal to h bar over 2.

00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:57.190
And this is a minimum
uncertainty thing.

00:44:57.190 --> 00:44:58.750
And it behaves quite nicely.

00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:05.950
All right, so the name
coherent now should make sense.

00:45:05.950 --> 00:45:09.480
You've produced a
quantum state that

00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:13.790
has about the energy of a state
that you're familiar with,

00:45:13.790 --> 00:45:18.310
and it moves classically,
and it doesn't change shape

00:45:18.310 --> 00:45:20.575
as it moves, so
it moves coherent.

00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:26.870
So our next task,
therefore, will

00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:30.390
be to understand this
in the energy basis.

00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:34.990
Because in the energy basis,
it looks like a miracle.

00:45:34.990 --> 00:45:36.980
You've suddenly
managed to produce

00:45:36.980 --> 00:45:41.020
a set of states of
different energies,

00:45:41.020 --> 00:45:44.150
created the superposition,
and suddenly, it

00:45:44.150 --> 00:45:45.620
moves in a nice way.

00:45:45.620 --> 00:45:48.450
Why does that happen?

00:45:48.450 --> 00:45:51.550
So we need to understand
the energy basis.

00:45:51.550 --> 00:45:53.560
And as we do that,
we'll understand

00:45:53.560 --> 00:45:58.090
how to generalize the
coherent states completely.

00:45:58.090 --> 00:46:02.690
So let's go on with
that, and let's

00:46:02.690 --> 00:46:04.860
explore this in
the energy basis.

00:46:22.690 --> 00:46:23.985
So what do we have?

00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:33.940
We have the coherent state--
no need to put the time yet--

00:46:33.940 --> 00:46:42.000
is e to the exponential of
minus i p hat X0 over h bar.

00:46:46.370 --> 00:46:48.940
There is, as you've
seen already,

00:46:48.940 --> 00:46:53.040
at length scale in the harmonic
oscillator-- famous length

00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:58.580
scale, and we'll have
an abbreviation for it.

00:46:58.580 --> 00:47:06.060
It's the length scale d0
squared h bar over m omega.

00:47:06.060 --> 00:47:11.850
You can use the parameters of
the harmonic oscillator-- h bar

00:47:11.850 --> 00:47:14.820
and m and omega-- to
produce a length scale.

00:47:14.820 --> 00:47:18.110
And that length scale is d0.

00:47:18.110 --> 00:47:24.930
It's essentially the uncertainty
in the position in the ground

00:47:24.930 --> 00:47:28.770
state, up to the
square root of 2.

00:47:28.770 --> 00:47:32.930
It's the way-- you want to
construct a length-- there

00:47:32.930 --> 00:47:36.060
it is-- the only way you
can construct a length.

00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:38.480
So I'm going to
use that notation.

00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:49.330
So let me put what the p is into
that formula, and simplify it.

00:47:49.330 --> 00:47:53.830
So this is on the vacuum-- I'm
sorry, I stopped half the way.

00:47:53.830 --> 00:48:02.590
So this is the exponential of X0
over square root of 2d a dagger

00:48:02.590 --> 00:48:07.325
minus a on the vacuum.

00:48:13.590 --> 00:48:18.800
Plug in the p, get
the h bars, and you

00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:22.710
will see that d
enters in that way.

00:48:22.710 --> 00:48:27.740
It's the way it has to enter,
because this exponential should

00:48:27.740 --> 00:48:32.850
have no units, and therefore
X0 over d0 has no units,

00:48:32.850 --> 00:48:36.820
and the a's and the a
daggers have no units.

00:48:36.820 --> 00:48:40.640
So it couldn't be any
way different like that.

00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:45.960
The i also shouldn't be
there, because this operator--

00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:49.550
the i was there to make
this anti-Hermitian.

00:48:49.550 --> 00:48:55.942
But this, with this real,
is already anti-Hermitian.

00:48:55.942 --> 00:48:57.150
You see, you take the dagger.

00:48:57.150 --> 00:48:59.450
It becomes minus itself.

00:48:59.450 --> 00:49:01.250
So this is anti-Hermitian.

00:49:01.250 --> 00:49:05.280
No need for an i-- in
fact, an i would be wrong,

00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:07.660
so there's no i.

00:49:07.660 --> 00:49:08.630
And that's this.

00:49:11.940 --> 00:49:17.780
Now, we want to figure out how
this looks in the energy basis,

00:49:17.780 --> 00:49:23.630
so what are we going to do?

00:49:23.630 --> 00:49:25.370
We're going to have
to do something

00:49:25.370 --> 00:49:27.610
with that exponential.

00:49:27.610 --> 00:49:29.710
We're going to
have to reorder it.

00:49:29.710 --> 00:49:31.520
This is a job for
Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff.

00:49:37.570 --> 00:49:38.660
Which one?

00:49:38.660 --> 00:49:45.600
Well, this one-- e to the X
plus Y is equal to e to X,

00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:50.670
e to the Y, e to
the minus 1/2-- I

00:49:50.670 --> 00:49:59.510
don't know this by heart--
XY, and it stops there.

00:49:59.510 --> 00:50:06.460
If and only if X commutator
with Y commutes with X,

00:50:06.460 --> 00:50:09.100
and commutes with Y.

00:50:09.100 --> 00:50:13.700
There was a problem
in the test that there

00:50:13.700 --> 00:50:17.690
was an operator with
Xp plus pX acting on X,

00:50:17.690 --> 00:50:22.630
and after you commuted,
you get X again,

00:50:22.630 --> 00:50:25.830
and you have to keep
including terms.

00:50:25.830 --> 00:50:40.410
So this stops here if XY
commutes with X and Y.

00:50:40.410 --> 00:50:42.330
And why do I want this?

00:50:42.330 --> 00:50:46.990
Because I actually want
to split the creation

00:50:46.990 --> 00:50:49.150
and the manipulation operators.

00:50:49.150 --> 00:50:53.630
I want them in
separate exponentials.

00:50:53.630 --> 00:50:59.650
We have that energy eigenstates
are creation operators

00:50:59.650 --> 00:51:05.080
on the vacuum, but here I have
creation minus destruction.

00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:07.500
So if I expand the
exponential, I'm

00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:10.030
going to get lots of
creation and destruction,

00:51:10.030 --> 00:51:14.510
and I'm going to spend
hours trying to sort it out.

00:51:14.510 --> 00:51:19.460
If you did expand it, I bet
you won't see it through

00:51:19.460 --> 00:51:22.920
so easily-- probably
will take you forever,

00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:26.440
and it might not work out.

00:51:26.440 --> 00:51:29.520
So expanding an
exponential is something

00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:33.480
that we should be
reluctant to do.

00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:36.500
On the other hand,
this is a nice option,

00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:38.810
because then you
think of this as e

00:51:38.810 --> 00:51:47.310
to the X0 over square root
of 2d0 a dagger minus X0

00:51:47.310 --> 00:51:49.525
over square root of 2d0 a.

00:51:55.520 --> 00:52:03.820
And I chose this analogy X
with this, and Y with this.

00:52:03.820 --> 00:52:08.300
It's like Y is this thing
minus that, and X is that.

00:52:08.300 --> 00:52:10.360
You could have done it
the other way around,

00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:13.510
but then you would run
into trouble again.

00:52:13.510 --> 00:52:14.440
Why?

00:52:14.440 --> 00:52:21.040
Because I want a Y factor
that has the manipulators

00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:26.480
to be to the right of the X
factor that has the creation.

00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:27.240
Why?

00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:33.740
Because if I have annihilators
closer to the vacuum,

00:52:33.740 --> 00:52:36.100
that's good.

00:52:36.100 --> 00:52:40.110
Annihilators closer to the
vacuum is what you really want,

00:52:40.110 --> 00:52:42.840
because if you have creators
close to the vacuum,

00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:45.290
they create state, but then
you have the manipulators,

00:52:45.290 --> 00:52:47.640
and you have to start
working them out.

00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:49.590
On the other hand,
if the annihilators

00:52:49.590 --> 00:52:52.880
are close to the vacuum,
they just kill the vacuum

00:52:52.880 --> 00:52:55.020
and you can forget them.

00:52:55.020 --> 00:53:00.130
So it's very important that
you identify X with this,

00:53:00.130 --> 00:53:03.840
and Y with this whole thing.

00:53:07.170 --> 00:53:18.830
So that this is e to the X0 over
square root of 2D0 a dagger, e

00:53:18.830 --> 00:53:26.470
to the minus X0 over
square root of 2d0 a.

00:53:26.470 --> 00:53:29.860
And now you're supposed to do
the commutator of these two

00:53:29.860 --> 00:53:30.600
things.

00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:32.560
And the commutator
is the commutator

00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:39.140
of an a dagger with
an a, and that is 1.

00:53:39.140 --> 00:53:44.860
So this commutator is
a number-- crucial,

00:53:44.860 --> 00:53:46.850
because if it wasn't
a number, if it

00:53:46.850 --> 00:53:49.680
would be an a or an a
dagger, it would not

00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:54.320
commute with a, X, and Y, and
you have to include more terms.

00:53:54.320 --> 00:53:57.190
So the fact that this
commutator is a number

00:53:57.190 --> 00:53:59.680
allows you to use this formula.

00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:05.960
So now we'll put this
factor here, minus 1/2.

00:54:05.960 --> 00:54:08.370
Then you have X
with Y, and that's

00:54:08.370 --> 00:54:17.740
X0 minus X0 over square
root of 2d squared,

00:54:17.740 --> 00:54:20.610
minus-- and this factor
squared-- an a dagger

00:54:20.610 --> 00:54:22.620
with a, which is minus 1.

00:54:25.340 --> 00:54:26.860
So that's that whole operator.

00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:36.860
So let's write it.

00:54:36.860 --> 00:54:40.550
The coherent state,
therefore, X0 tilde,

00:54:40.550 --> 00:54:47.610
is equal to e to the X0 over
square root of 2d0 a hat

00:54:47.610 --> 00:54:55.390
dagger, e to the minus X0
over square root of 2d0 a,

00:54:55.390 --> 00:55:04.130
and this factor that seems
to be e to the minus 1/4 X0

00:55:04.130 --> 00:55:07.420
squared over d0 squared.

00:55:07.420 --> 00:55:12.340
And here is this nice vacuum.

00:55:12.340 --> 00:55:14.770
Yes, factor is right.

00:55:14.770 --> 00:55:17.680
So what is this?

00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:22.540
Well, this is a number, so
I can pull it to the left.

00:55:22.540 --> 00:55:27.280
And here is the exponential
of the annihilator operator.

00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:29.480
Now expand the exponential.

00:55:29.480 --> 00:55:30.680
It's 1.

00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:34.900
That survives, but the first
term has an a-- kills it.

00:55:34.900 --> 00:55:38.120
The second term has an
a squared-- kills it.

00:55:38.120 --> 00:55:40.260
Everything kills it.

00:55:40.260 --> 00:55:44.640
This thing acting on
the vacuum is just 1.

00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:47.380
That's why this is simple.

00:55:47.380 --> 00:55:48.920
So what have we got?

00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:56.290
In the state X0 tilde is e
to the minus 1/4 X0 squared

00:55:56.290 --> 00:56:04.660
over d0 squared times e to
the X0 over square root of 2d0

00:56:04.660 --> 00:56:07.115
a dagger on the vacuum.

00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:22.700
Well this is nice-- not
quite energy eigenstates,

00:56:22.700 --> 00:56:25.480
but we're almost there.

00:56:25.480 --> 00:56:27.050
What is this?

00:56:27.050 --> 00:56:33.780
e to the minus 1/4, X0
squared over d0 squared.

00:56:33.780 --> 00:56:35.210
And now expand.

00:56:35.210 --> 00:56:39.850
This is the sum from n
equals 1 to infinity,

00:56:39.850 --> 00:56:43.600
1 over n factorial.

00:56:43.600 --> 00:56:47.948
X0 over square root
of 2d0 to the n,

00:56:47.948 --> 00:56:52.530
a hat dagger to the
n on the vacuum.

00:56:58.220 --> 00:57:02.680
And what was the nth
energy eigenstate?

00:57:02.680 --> 00:57:04.000
You probably remember.

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:07.130
The nth energy
eigenstate is a dagger

00:57:07.130 --> 00:57:12.370
to the n on the vacuum over
square root of n factorial.

00:57:12.370 --> 00:57:16.320
So we've got a little
more than the square root

00:57:16.320 --> 00:57:17.560
of 2 n factorial.

00:57:17.560 --> 00:57:22.480
So maybe I'll do it here.

00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:31.450
We get e to the minus 1/4
X0 squared over d0 squared,

00:57:31.450 --> 00:57:42.300
sum from n equals
1 to infinity, 1

00:57:42.300 --> 00:57:51.410
over square root of n factorial,
X0 over the square root of 2 d0

00:57:51.410 --> 00:57:55.610
to the n times the
nth energy eigenstate.

00:57:58.730 --> 00:58:07.180
It's a little messy,
but not so bad.

00:58:07.180 --> 00:58:10.080
I think actually I
won't need that anymore.

00:58:10.080 --> 00:58:11.445
Well no, I may.

00:58:11.445 --> 00:58:11.945
I will.

00:58:14.670 --> 00:58:22.650
So let's write it maybe again.

00:58:22.650 --> 00:58:25.630
Well, it's OK.

00:58:25.630 --> 00:58:30.540
Let's write it as
follows-- Cn n.

00:58:37.144 --> 00:58:42.950
OK, so I got some cn's and n's.

00:58:42.950 --> 00:58:46.600
So this is a very
precise superposition

00:58:46.600 --> 00:58:51.040
of energy eigenstates,
very delicate superposition

00:58:51.040 --> 00:58:54.290
of energy eigenstates.

00:58:54.290 --> 00:59:00.610
Let me write it in the
following way-- cn squared.

00:59:03.440 --> 00:59:07.200
Why would I care
about cn squared?

00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:13.940
cn squared is the probability
to find the coherent state

00:59:13.940 --> 00:59:17.020
in the nth energy eigenstate.

00:59:17.020 --> 00:59:21.540
The amplitude to have it in the
nth energy eigenstate is cn.

00:59:21.540 --> 00:59:26.020
So that probability to find it
in the nth energy eigenstate

00:59:26.020 --> 00:59:34.080
is cn squared, is the
probability 4x tilde 0

00:59:34.080 --> 00:59:39.680
2b in the nth energy eigenstate.

00:59:39.680 --> 00:59:40.800
That is what?

00:59:40.800 --> 00:59:50.220
Exponential of minus 1/2
x0 squared over d0 squared.

00:59:50.220 --> 00:59:51.770
And I have to square that.

00:59:51.770 --> 00:59:56.322
So I have 1 over n factorial.

00:59:56.322 --> 00:59:58.980
I have to square that
coefficient there.

00:59:58.980 --> 01:00:03.970
So it's x0 squared over
2d0 squared-- that's

01:00:03.970 --> 01:00:06.700
nice, it's the same
one here-- to the n.

01:00:12.670 --> 01:00:17.210
So it's easier to
think of this if you

01:00:17.210 --> 01:00:28.410
invent a new letter, lambda, to
be x0 squared over 2d0 squared.

01:00:30.940 --> 01:00:39.850
Then, cn squared is equal to
e to the minus lambda lambda

01:00:39.850 --> 01:00:42.170
to the n over n factorial.

01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:07.680
Yes.

01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:10.039
AUDIENCE: Is that
something that we

01:01:10.039 --> 01:01:13.532
should expect to be true
for any time of [INAUDIBLE],

01:01:13.532 --> 01:01:15.528
or is that something
that we [INAUDIBLE]?

01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:24.120
PROFESSOR: Well, let
me say it this way.

01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:26.400
In a second, it
will become clear

01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:29.280
that this was almost necessary.

01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:35.050
I actually don't know very
deeply why this is true.

01:01:35.050 --> 01:01:38.570
And I'm always a little puzzled
and uncomfortable at this point

01:01:38.570 --> 01:01:40.840
in 805.

01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:43.925
So what is really
strange about this

01:01:43.925 --> 01:01:47.245
is that this is the so-called
Poisson distribution.

01:01:49.990 --> 01:01:53.290
So there's something about
this energy eigenstate

01:01:53.290 --> 01:01:58.270
that their Poisson distributed
in a coherent state.

01:01:58.270 --> 01:02:04.150
So these are probabilities,
as I claimed, to find an n.

01:02:04.150 --> 01:02:09.750
And indeed, let's check the
sum of the cn squareds from n

01:02:09.750 --> 01:02:12.410
equals 1 to infinity.

01:02:12.410 --> 01:02:13.500
Let's see what it is.

01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:17.734
And you will see, you
cannot tinker with this.

01:02:17.734 --> 01:02:21.530
This is e to the minus
lambda the sum from n

01:02:21.530 --> 01:02:26.850
equals 1 to infinity lambda
to the n over n factorial.

01:02:26.850 --> 01:02:29.810
And that sum-- it's
not from n equals 1.

01:02:29.810 --> 01:02:32.370
It's 0 to infinity, I'm sorry.

01:02:32.370 --> 01:02:34.750
Did I write once anywhere?

01:02:34.750 --> 01:02:37.940
Yeah, it should be 0.

01:02:37.940 --> 01:02:39.425
OK, this is 0.

01:02:42.250 --> 01:02:49.290
There is the ground state, so
from n equals 0 to infinity.

01:02:49.290 --> 01:02:52.090
And this is e to
the minus lambda e

01:02:52.090 --> 01:02:54.030
to the lambda, which is 1.

01:02:58.140 --> 01:03:01.390
So yes, this is
Poisson distributed.

01:03:04.170 --> 01:03:07.930
It's some sort of
distribution like that.

01:03:07.930 --> 01:03:18.470
So if you have the n's, the
cn's, Poisson distributions

01:03:18.470 --> 01:03:22.485
have to do with if you have
a radioactive material.

01:03:22.485 --> 01:03:24.030
It has a lifetime.

01:03:24.030 --> 01:03:26.870
And you say, how many
events should I--

01:03:26.870 --> 01:03:28.690
the lifetime is five years.

01:03:28.690 --> 01:03:32.850
How many events should you
expect to happen in a week?

01:03:32.850 --> 01:03:34.130
These are Poisson distributed.

01:03:37.100 --> 01:03:40.740
So it's a Poisson distribution.

01:03:40.740 --> 01:03:43.930
It's a very nice thing.

01:03:43.930 --> 01:03:49.160
So let me just make one
more remark about it.

01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:56.530
And it's quite something.

01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:08.380
So one question
that you could ask

01:04:08.380 --> 01:04:13.130
is, what is the most probable n?

01:04:13.130 --> 01:04:15.030
That's a good question.

01:04:15.030 --> 01:04:17.026
You have a coherent state.

01:04:17.026 --> 01:04:18.650
So it's going to have
the superposition

01:04:18.650 --> 01:04:20.570
of the vacuum, the first.

01:04:20.570 --> 01:04:27.300
What is the most probable n,
so the expectation value of n?

01:04:27.300 --> 01:04:30.960
Now, I'm thinking of
it probabilistically.

01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:33.916
So I'm thinking this is a
probability distribution.

01:04:36.860 --> 01:04:40.020
Then, I will show it for
you that this is really

01:04:40.020 --> 01:04:41.390
computing what you want.

01:04:41.390 --> 01:04:46.270
But probabilistically, what
is the expectation value of n?

01:04:46.270 --> 01:04:49.995
You should sum n times the
probability that you get n.

01:04:53.590 --> 01:05:02.160
So this is sum over ne to
the minus lambda lambda

01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:04.570
to the n over n factorial.

01:05:04.570 --> 01:05:07.152
So you got an n there.

01:05:07.152 --> 01:05:11.410
And the way you get an n there--
well, the e to the minus lambda

01:05:11.410 --> 01:05:14.100
goes out.

01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:18.230
And the n can be reproduced
by doing lambda d d

01:05:18.230 --> 01:05:20.670
lambda on the sum.

01:05:23.590 --> 01:05:27.630
Because lambda d d lambda on
this sum brings down this n,

01:05:27.630 --> 01:05:31.380
puts back the lambda so it
gives you the thing you had,

01:05:31.380 --> 01:05:32.700
and that's what it is.

01:05:32.700 --> 01:05:38.485
So here, you get e to
the minus lambda lambda

01:05:38.485 --> 01:05:44.280
d d lambda of e to the lambda.

01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:47.730
And that is lambda, OK?

01:05:51.220 --> 01:05:59.765
So the expectation value of
the most sort of not the peak,

01:05:59.765 --> 01:06:05.590
but the expected value of n in
this distribution, the level

01:06:05.590 --> 01:06:08.980
that you're going to be
excited is basically lambda.

01:06:08.980 --> 01:06:16.140
So if x0 is 1,000
times bigger than d0,

01:06:16.140 --> 01:06:22.290
you've moved this thing 1,000
times the quantum uncertainty.

01:06:22.290 --> 01:06:26.010
Then, you're occupying
most strongly the levels

01:06:26.010 --> 01:06:29.160
at 1 million.

01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:37.590
You get x0 over d0 controls
which n is the most likely.

01:06:37.590 --> 01:06:41.140
Indeed, look, this
n-- suppose you

01:06:41.140 --> 01:06:48.375
would compute x0
tilde n hat x0 tilde.

01:06:53.120 --> 01:06:56.290
This is what you would think
is an occupation number.

01:06:56.290 --> 01:06:59.110
This sounds a little hand wavy.

01:06:59.110 --> 01:07:02.890
But this is the number
operator, the expected value

01:07:02.890 --> 01:07:06.030
of the number operator,
in the coherent state.

01:07:06.030 --> 01:07:12.410
But this is-- you have that
the coherent state is this.

01:07:12.410 --> 01:07:15.640
So let's substitute
that in there.

01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:19.860
So you get two sums
over n and over m.

01:07:19.860 --> 01:07:32.500
And you would have
cm star m N n cn.

01:07:32.500 --> 01:07:37.030
I've substituted
x0 and x0 dagger.

01:07:37.030 --> 01:07:40.140
The c's in fact are real.

01:07:40.140 --> 01:07:44.240
And then, the number
operator on here is little n.

01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:46.380
And then, you get
the Kronecker delta.

01:07:46.380 --> 01:07:53.690
So this is sum over n
and m cmcn-- it's real.

01:07:53.690 --> 01:07:57.880
And then, you get n delta m, n.

01:07:57.880 --> 01:08:03.800
So this is in fact the
sum over ncn squared.

01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:06.780
So what we wrote
here, this is really

01:08:06.780 --> 01:08:09.195
the expectation value
of the number operator.

01:08:12.260 --> 01:08:17.040
And one can do more
calculations here.

01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:20.229
A calculation that is
particularly interesting

01:08:20.229 --> 01:08:24.109
to discover what
these states look like

01:08:24.109 --> 01:08:30.069
is the uncertainty
in the energy.

01:08:30.069 --> 01:08:36.060
So that's another sort
of relevant measure.

01:08:36.060 --> 01:08:39.180
How big is the
uncertainty in the energy?

01:08:41.800 --> 01:08:48.200
What are, basically,
the delta E associated

01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:49.510
to the coherent state?

01:08:49.510 --> 01:08:52.720
How does it look like?

01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:53.795
Is it very sharp?

01:08:56.460 --> 01:08:59.490
So it's a good question.

01:08:59.490 --> 01:09:02.220
And it's in the notes.

01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:05.399
I leave it for you to
try to calculate it.

01:09:05.399 --> 01:09:14.080
Delta E in the coherent
state x0, how much is it?

01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:18.029
And it turns out to be
the following-- h omega

01:09:18.029 --> 01:09:20.384
x0 over square root of 2d.

01:09:24.689 --> 01:09:28.160
So actually, maybe this
is a little surprising.

01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:37.529
But delta E over h omega
is equal to x0 over d.

01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:46.689
So actually, the
energy uncertainty

01:09:46.689 --> 01:09:50.180
for a classical look in
coherent state-- I'm sorry,

01:09:50.180 --> 01:09:52.189
I'm missing a square
root of 2 there.

01:09:56.480 --> 01:10:00.020
So what is a classical
looking coherent state?

01:10:00.020 --> 01:10:05.580
It's a state in which x0 is
much bigger than the quantum d.

01:10:05.580 --> 01:10:09.450
So x0 is much bigger than d.

01:10:09.450 --> 01:10:17.530
So in that case, this is a large
number for a classical state--

01:10:17.530 --> 01:10:21.480
"classical" state.

01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:26.480
But in that case, the
uncertainty in delta E

01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:31.280
is really big compared
to the spacing

01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:33.540
of the harmonic oscillator.

01:10:33.540 --> 01:10:37.150
So you have-- here
is the ground state.

01:10:37.150 --> 01:10:39.270
Here is h omega.

01:10:39.270 --> 01:10:43.040
Here is the coherent
state, maybe.

01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:48.740
And you have a lot of energy
levels that are excited.

01:10:48.740 --> 01:10:52.730
So if x0 over this
is 1,000, well,

01:10:52.730 --> 01:10:57.740
at least 1,000 energy
levels are excited.

01:10:57.740 --> 01:11:01.810
But you shouldn't
fear that too much.

01:11:01.810 --> 01:11:07.960
Because at the same time,
the expectation value of E

01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:11.980
over delta E-- the
expectation of E

01:11:11.980 --> 01:11:15.120
is something we calculated at
the beginning of the lecture.

01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:17.520
You have the
oscillator displaced.

01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:23.320
So this is roughly 1/2 m
omega squared x0 squared.

01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:25.310
Throw away the
ground state energy.

01:11:25.310 --> 01:11:27.570
That's supposed
to be very little.

01:11:27.570 --> 01:11:33.920
Delta E is h bar omega
x0 over square root of 2.

01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:36.265
And this is, again,
the same ratio.

01:11:39.980 --> 01:11:46.620
So yes, this state
is very funny.

01:11:46.620 --> 01:11:52.990
It contains an uncertainty that
measured in harmonic oscillator

01:11:52.990 --> 01:11:56.080
levels contains many levels.

01:11:56.080 --> 01:12:01.280
But still, the uncertainty
is much smaller

01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:05.490
by the same amount than
the average energy.

01:12:05.490 --> 01:12:10.510
So this state is a state of
some almost definite energy,

01:12:10.510 --> 01:12:12.830
the uncertainty
being much smaller.

01:12:12.830 --> 01:12:15.020
But even though
it's much smaller,

01:12:15.020 --> 01:12:19.500
it still contains a lot of
levels of the oscillator.

01:12:22.490 --> 01:12:28.510
So that I think gives you a
reasonable picture of this.

01:12:28.510 --> 01:12:32.010
So you're ready for
a generalization.

01:12:32.010 --> 01:12:37.890
This is a time to generalize
the coherent states

01:12:37.890 --> 01:12:40.220
and produce the set
of coherent states

01:12:40.220 --> 01:12:45.073
that are most useful
eventually, and most flexible.

01:12:48.050 --> 01:12:50.560
And we do them as follows.

01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:59.290
We basically are
inspired by this formula

01:12:59.290 --> 01:13:01.020
to write the following operator.

01:13:05.500 --> 01:13:07.760
And here, we change notation.

01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:09.500
This x0 was here.

01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:11.420
But now we'll introduce
what is called

01:13:11.420 --> 01:13:16.190
the alpha coherent state.

01:13:16.190 --> 01:13:19.860
Most general coherent
state is going

01:13:19.860 --> 01:13:26.070
to be obtained by acted with a
unitary operator on the vacuum.

01:13:26.070 --> 01:13:30.126
So far so good-- D
of alpha unitary.

01:13:34.060 --> 01:13:39.070
But now generalize
what you have there.

01:13:39.070 --> 01:13:42.630
Here, you put a minus
a dagger minus a,

01:13:42.630 --> 01:13:46.030
because that was anti-Hermitian,
and you put the real constant.

01:13:46.030 --> 01:13:52.580
Now this alpha will belong
to the complex numbers.

01:13:52.580 --> 01:13:56.430
Quantum mechanics is all
about complex numbers.

01:13:56.430 --> 01:14:00.570
You've got complex vector
spaces, complex numbers.

01:14:00.570 --> 01:14:02.040
It's all over the place.

01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:04.660
So how do we do this?

01:14:04.660 --> 01:14:10.630
We do this exponential
of alpha a dagger.

01:14:10.630 --> 01:14:13.360
And I want it to
be anti-Hermitian.

01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:24.580
So I should put minus
alpha star a on the vacuum.

01:14:24.580 --> 01:14:29.180
This thing for alpha
equals-- this real number

01:14:29.180 --> 01:14:31.060
reduces to that.

01:14:31.060 --> 01:14:34.720
But now, with
alpha complex, it's

01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:38.210
a little more
complicated operator.

01:14:38.210 --> 01:14:39.460
And it's more general.

01:14:39.460 --> 01:14:42.770
But it's still unitary.

01:14:42.770 --> 01:14:44.840
And it preserves a norm.

01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:49.280
And its most of what you
want from these states.

01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:52.660
So the first thing
you do to figure out

01:14:52.660 --> 01:14:58.740
what this operator does
is to calculate something

01:14:58.740 --> 01:15:03.410
that maybe you would not
expect it to be simple.

01:15:03.410 --> 01:15:06.740
But it's worth doing.

01:15:06.740 --> 01:15:11.330
What is a acting
on the alpha state?

01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:19.590
Well, I would have
to do a acting

01:15:19.590 --> 01:15:26.060
on this exponential of
alpha a dagger minus alpha

01:15:26.060 --> 01:15:29.480
star a on the vacuum.

01:15:34.470 --> 01:15:39.350
Now, a kills the vacuum.

01:15:39.350 --> 01:15:43.460
So maybe you're accustomed
already to the next step.

01:15:43.460 --> 01:15:47.470
I can replace that
product by a commutator.

01:15:47.470 --> 01:15:50.640
Because the other ordering is 0.

01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:54.050
So this is equal
to the commutator.

01:15:54.050 --> 01:16:00.060
Because the other term when a is
on the other side is 0 anyway.

01:16:00.060 --> 01:16:02.900
And now I have to
compute the commutator

01:16:02.900 --> 01:16:04.535
of a with an exponential.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:11.160
Again, it's a little scary.

01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:16.586
But A with an
exponential e to the B--

01:16:16.586 --> 01:16:19.990
it's in the formula sheet,
this Campbell-Baker-Hausdorff

01:16:19.990 --> 01:16:37.080
again-- is A, B e to the
B if A, B commutes with B.

01:16:37.080 --> 01:16:47.310
Well, this is A.
This is B. A with B

01:16:47.310 --> 01:16:53.920
is-- A with B, the
exponent-- just alpha times 1

01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:54.670
because of this.

01:16:54.670 --> 01:16:55.590
So it's a number.

01:16:55.590 --> 01:16:57.770
So this is safe.

01:16:57.770 --> 01:17:01.306
So you get alpha times
the same exponential.

01:17:04.270 --> 01:17:07.180
But the same exponential
means the state

01:17:07.180 --> 01:17:14.120
alpha-- a little
quick, isn't it?

01:17:14.120 --> 01:17:20.190
OK, A with B, this
factor, was alpha.

01:17:20.190 --> 01:17:26.160
And e to the B anyway on the
vacuum is the state alpha.

01:17:26.160 --> 01:17:28.910
So there you go.

01:17:28.910 --> 01:17:30.665
You have achieved
the impossible.

01:17:33.510 --> 01:17:37.375
You've diagonalized a
non-Hermitian operator.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:45.080
This is not Hermitian, and
you found its eigenvalues.

01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:48.850
How could that happen?

01:17:48.850 --> 01:17:52.340
Well, it can happen.

01:17:52.340 --> 01:17:54.350
But then, all of the
theorems that you

01:17:54.350 --> 01:17:58.290
like about Hermitian
operators don't hold.

01:17:58.290 --> 01:17:59.810
So it's a fluke.

01:17:59.810 --> 01:18:01.350
This can be done.

01:18:01.350 --> 01:18:05.860
But then, states that correspond
to different eigenvalues

01:18:05.860 --> 01:18:08.770
will not be orthogonal,
and they will not

01:18:08.770 --> 01:18:11.680
form a complete set
of states, and nothing

01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:16.220
will be quite as you
may think it would be.

01:18:16.220 --> 01:18:19.450
But still, it's quite remarkable
that this can be done.

01:18:22.020 --> 01:18:26.610
So this characterizes the
coherent state in a nice way.

01:18:26.610 --> 01:18:29.600
They're eigenstates of
the destruction operator.

01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:34.310
And they're the most
general exponentials

01:18:34.310 --> 01:18:40.500
of creation and annihilation
operators acting on the vacuum.

01:18:40.500 --> 01:18:49.000
Now, we knew that when alpha
is real, it has to do with x0.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:53.520
So we've put a complex alpha.

01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:55.440
What will it do?

01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:59.650
A complex alpha,
what it does is gives

01:18:59.650 --> 01:19:03.570
the original coherent
state some momentum.

01:19:03.570 --> 01:19:06.760
Remember, the original
state that we had was an x0.

01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:08.490
And how did it move?

01:19:08.490 --> 01:19:11.100
x0 cosine of omega t.

01:19:11.100 --> 01:19:14.550
So at time equals 0,
it had 0 momentum.

01:19:14.550 --> 01:19:19.150
This creates a
coherent state at x0,

01:19:19.150 --> 01:19:21.980
and it gives it a
momentum controlled

01:19:21.980 --> 01:19:25.170
by the imaginary
part of this thing.

01:19:25.170 --> 01:19:28.250
In fact, we can do
this as follows.

01:19:28.250 --> 01:19:30.460
You can ask, what
is the expectation

01:19:30.460 --> 01:19:33.960
value of x in this state?

01:19:33.960 --> 01:19:37.660
Well, x is written here.

01:19:37.660 --> 01:19:49.041
It's d over square root of 2
alpha a plus a dagger alpha.

01:19:49.041 --> 01:19:53.160
And look, these are
easy to compute.

01:19:53.160 --> 01:19:57.110
a gives an alpha,
gives you alpha.

01:19:57.110 --> 01:20:00.380
a dagger and alpha, you
don't know what it is.

01:20:00.380 --> 01:20:05.620
But a dagger on [? brau ?]
alpha is alpha star.

01:20:05.620 --> 01:20:07.940
So this one you
know on the right.

01:20:07.940 --> 01:20:10.980
This one you know on the left.

01:20:10.980 --> 01:20:16.070
It gives you the over
square root of 2 alpha plus

01:20:16.070 --> 01:20:17.880
alpha star.

01:20:17.880 --> 01:20:23.670
So it's square root
of 2d real of alpha.

01:20:23.670 --> 01:20:28.535
So the real part of alpha is
the expectation value of x.

01:20:31.400 --> 01:20:33.475
So I'll go here.

01:20:39.420 --> 01:20:43.840
I'm almost done-- waiting
for the punch line.

01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:52.740
Similarly, you can calculate
the expectation value

01:20:52.740 --> 01:20:55.111
of the momentum.

01:20:55.111 --> 01:21:00.010
It will be alpha p alpha.

01:21:00.010 --> 01:21:02.620
And p is a minus a dagger.

01:21:02.620 --> 01:21:07.230
So you're going to get
alpha star minus alpha, so

01:21:07.230 --> 01:21:08.770
the imaginary part.

01:21:08.770 --> 01:21:15.310
So p is actually
square root of 2 h

01:21:15.310 --> 01:21:20.570
bar over d imaginary
part of alpha.

01:21:20.570 --> 01:21:22.250
So the physics is clear.

01:21:22.250 --> 01:21:24.920
Maybe the formulas
are a little messy.

01:21:24.920 --> 01:21:31.005
But when you have an alpha,
the real part of alpha

01:21:31.005 --> 01:21:34.590
is telling you where you're
positioning the coherent state.

01:21:34.590 --> 01:21:37.020
The imaginary part
of alpha is telling

01:21:37.020 --> 01:21:39.450
what kick are you giving to it.

01:21:39.450 --> 01:21:43.690
And you now have produced the
most general coherent state.

01:21:43.690 --> 01:21:49.490
So how do we describe
that geometrically?

01:21:49.490 --> 01:21:51.655
We imagine it, the alpha plane.

01:21:55.050 --> 01:21:57.970
And here it is.

01:21:57.970 --> 01:22:02.810
The alpha plane, here is the
vector, the complex number

01:22:02.810 --> 01:22:06.530
alpha that you've chosen
maybe for your state,

01:22:06.530 --> 01:22:09.970
some particular
complex value alpha.

01:22:09.970 --> 01:22:13.100
On the x-axis, the
real part of alpha

01:22:13.100 --> 01:22:20.020
is the expectation value of
x over square root of 2d.

01:22:20.020 --> 01:22:22.970
The real part of alpha
is the expectation value

01:22:22.970 --> 01:22:25.620
of x over square root of 2d.

01:22:25.620 --> 01:22:29.670
And the imaginary part of
alpha is the expectation value

01:22:29.670 --> 01:22:35.950
of p over square
root of 2 h bar d.

01:22:39.100 --> 01:22:43.120
And there it is, your
state at time equals 0.

01:22:45.730 --> 01:22:49.880
What is it going to
do a little later?

01:22:49.880 --> 01:22:52.080
Well, that will
be the last thing

01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:54.610
I want to calculate for you.

01:22:54.610 --> 01:22:56.675
It's a nice answer.

01:22:56.675 --> 01:22:58.820
And you should see it.

01:22:58.820 --> 01:23:01.555
It's going to take
me two minutes.

01:23:04.290 --> 01:23:05.990
And what is it?

01:23:05.990 --> 01:23:12.180
Well, alpha at time t, you
have to evolve the state-- e

01:23:12.180 --> 01:23:18.580
to the minus iHt over h
bar on the state, which

01:23:18.580 --> 01:23:27.970
is e to the alpha a dagger minus
alpha star a e to the output

01:23:27.970 --> 01:23:37.090
and into the iHt over h bar,
and an e to the minus iHt over h

01:23:37.090 --> 01:23:38.640
bar on the vacuum.

01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:40.420
So I put the one here.

01:23:40.420 --> 01:23:42.830
I evolve with this.

01:23:42.830 --> 01:23:47.210
But I take the state
and put this and that.

01:23:47.210 --> 01:23:49.265
This is simple.

01:23:49.265 --> 01:23:54.980
It's e to the minus
iH omega over 2.

01:23:54.980 --> 01:23:56.980
That's the energy
of the ground state.

01:23:59.500 --> 01:24:01.850
But what is this part?

01:24:05.980 --> 01:24:11.080
It's pretty much the
Heisenberg operator.

01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:13.020
But the sign came out wrong.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.530
Well, it didn't come out wrong.

01:24:18.530 --> 01:24:21.250
It's what it is.

01:24:21.250 --> 01:24:24.290
It just means that
what I have to put here

01:24:24.290 --> 01:24:29.000
is the Heisenberg
operator at minus t.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.250
Because I have t for minus t.

01:24:31.250 --> 01:24:36.010
So this is e to the
alpha a Heisenberg at

01:24:36.010 --> 01:24:40.536
minus t dagger minus alpha star.

01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:45.910
I'm sorry, I have too
many parentheses here.

01:24:48.690 --> 01:24:52.880
That's it, much
better-- minus alpha

01:24:52.880 --> 01:25:00.050
star a Heisenberg of minus
t acting on this thing.

01:25:00.050 --> 01:25:01.400
And what is this?

01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:04.800
Well, we have the formula for
the Heisenberg states here.

01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:11.840
So you've got e to the
alpha H a dagger of minus t

01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:20.390
would be e to the minus
I omega t a dagger.

01:25:20.390 --> 01:25:23.950
And here, you have
minus alpha star e

01:25:23.950 --> 01:25:30.210
to the i omega t a
on e to the minus

01:25:30.210 --> 01:25:35.110
i omega h bar over
2 times the vacuum.

01:25:35.110 --> 01:25:36.430
And look what has happened.

01:25:39.130 --> 01:25:44.860
Alpha has become alpha times
e to the minus i omega t.

01:25:44.860 --> 01:25:47.200
Because the star is here.

01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:50.200
It's minus the star one.

01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:52.460
So the only thing
that has changed

01:25:52.460 --> 01:25:57.590
is that this state,
alpha at time t,

01:25:57.590 --> 01:26:03.590
is e to the minus
ih bar omega over 2.

01:26:03.590 --> 01:26:05.290
I'm sorry, I'm missing a t here.

01:26:07.810 --> 01:26:09.160
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:26:09.160 --> 01:26:18.800
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I dropped--
yeah, minus i omega t over 2,

01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:29.370
minus i omega t over 2,
minus i omega t over 2,

01:26:29.370 --> 01:26:35.880
times the coherent state, the
time independent coherent state

01:26:35.880 --> 01:26:40.090
of value e to the
minus i omega t alpha.

01:26:40.090 --> 01:26:41.745
That's a new complex number.

01:26:45.390 --> 01:26:48.290
That's what has happened.

01:26:48.290 --> 01:26:51.940
The number alpha has become
e to the minus i omega t.

01:26:51.940 --> 01:26:55.410
Now, this is a face for the
whole state multiplicative.

01:26:55.410 --> 01:26:56.900
It's irrelevant.

01:26:56.900 --> 01:26:59.040
So what has this alpha done?

01:26:59.040 --> 01:27:03.390
It has been rotated by e
to the minus i omega t.

01:27:03.390 --> 01:27:09.880
So this at the time t
is the state alpha t.

01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:11.220
Here is the state alpha.

01:27:11.220 --> 01:27:15.500
And it has rotated by omega t.

01:27:15.500 --> 01:27:18.650
So the coherent state
can be visualized

01:27:18.650 --> 01:27:22.870
as a complex number
in this complex plane.

01:27:22.870 --> 01:27:26.110
This real part is the
expectation value of x at time

01:27:26.110 --> 01:27:28.760
equals 0 whose imaginary
part is the expectation

01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:31.720
value of the momentum
at time equals 0.

01:27:31.720 --> 01:27:33.700
And how does it evolve?

01:27:33.700 --> 01:27:37.480
This state just rotates
with frequency omega

01:27:37.480 --> 01:27:40.510
all along and forever.

01:27:40.510 --> 01:27:43.120
All right, that's it for today.

01:27:43.120 --> 01:27:44.670
See you on Wednesday.

01:27:44.670 --> 01:27:46.470
[APPLAUSE]

01:27:46.470 --> 01:27:48.431
PROFESSOR: Thank you, thank you.
