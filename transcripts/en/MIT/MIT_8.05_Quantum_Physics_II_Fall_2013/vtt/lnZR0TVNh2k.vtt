00:00:21.275 --> 00:00:22.150
PROFESSOR: Very good.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.960
So today, we'll
begin with a study

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.360
of one dimensional potentials
and the energy eigenstates

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.150
or properties.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:39.190
And we'll discuss this for
about half of the lecture.

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.700
And then go into the
variational principle.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.490
So let me go back then to
our discussion of last time,

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:51.960
where we were talking
about energy eigenstates

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.040
and the Schrodinger
equation in one dimension.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.330
So there's a term that
we use all the time.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.850
This term is called
the bound state.

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:06.160
And bound state seems something
sort of very non-trivial.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.650
But mathematically, we can
say quite clearly what it is.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.610
A bound state is
something that is not

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.500
spread all over
space, basically.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.120
And the way we therefore use
the terminology for bound

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.010
state it that we only
speak of bound states

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.420
when there are
energy eigenstates.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.500
So an energy eigenstate may
or may not be a bound state,

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.380
but any bound state is
an energy eigenstate.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.330
So an energy eigenstate
is a bound state

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.710
if the wave function
goes to zero

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.400
when you go
sufficiently far away.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.710
So it's a simple
definition, but it

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.710
helps us understand
that the basic idea is

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.480
at the state is just not
spread all over the world.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:58.240
Now remember we're trying
to find energy eigenstates,

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.020
and that is to find
wave functions, time

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.920
independent wave functions,
that solve the time

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.350
independent
Schrodinger equation.

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.889
Which I have written
there for convenience.

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:15.110
This is the same equation
we wrote last time.

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.500
For a time
independent potential,

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.880
so that the full
wave function can

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.760
be written as a
phase that contains

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.590
the information of the
energy times a function of x,

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.280
sine of x.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.210
That still may be complex, but
it doesn't have to be complex.

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.355
As you can see, this
is a real equation.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:45.010
Now in order to clean up some of
the constants in this equation,

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.146
it's-- yes?

00:02:47.146 --> 00:02:49.257
AUDIENCE: Why is
it not V x minus e?

00:02:49.257 --> 00:02:51.590
PROFESSOR: Well you have to
look back at the Schrodinger

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.680
equation, and bring the
things to the other side,

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.330
and take care of the signs.

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.250
It is correct as stated.

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.965
Check it.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:10.580
Now we have, in order
to do this and just

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.930
to write things with
a little more clarity,

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.580
we scale the energy.

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.590
So we define a
calligraphic energy,

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:33.140
which is 2m over h squared times
energy E. And a calligraphic V

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.100
with the same scaling factor.

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.820
So that the Schrodinger
equation then takes the form--

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.170
this same equation-- sine.

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:53.200
And I'll use the double prime
notation for two derivatives.

00:03:53.200 --> 00:04:03.250
Plus now E minus cal
of x sine equals zero.

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.890
So this is how our
equation looks.

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.030
It's relatively simple.

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.920
And can be treated
without carrying constants

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.120
all over the place.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:23.200
Now we're going to
discuss a few results that

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:28.120
are extremely important that
you keep in mind for the future.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.550
It helps you think clearly.

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:35.360
So these results are
little theorems that I'm

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.080
going to state.

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.980
And the proofs are
given in the notes.

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:42.500
I will skip some of
the proofs, although I

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.630
will tell you what the
strategy is for the proofs

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.950
and then show how
the theorem implies,

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:55.370
as a corollary,
interesting things that

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.110
could easily be misconstrued.

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.890
So let me give you
the first theorem.

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:01.700
Theorem one.

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.110
This is just the
statement that if you

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:13.070
are talking about bound states
in one dimensional potentials,

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.720
there are no degeneracies.

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.080
So let's write it.

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:33.190
There is no degeneracy
for bound states of one

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:35.840
dimensional potentials.

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:44.030
So it's a fundamental result.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:52.080
We'll see some way to
understand it a little later.

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.650
And you have seen this
in 804, I believe.

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:59.610
So what is a
strategy to a proof?

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:01.760
So we want a rigorous proof.

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.490
So what is a strategy?

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:05.380
I will not go through the proof.

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:10.280
The strategy is to assume
there is a degeneracy.

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:18.426
So strategy, assume
a degeneracy.

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:35.930
So sine 1 and sine 2 different
with the same energy.

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:43.180
And then you write this
equation for sine 1 and sine 2,

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:45.600
and they have the same energy.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.360
Then you take the two equations,
and you multiply the first

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.390
by something, the
second by another thing.

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:51.640
Subtract it.

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.340
Do a bit of algebra.

00:06:53.340 --> 00:07:02.640
And you suddenly can
prove that one solution

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:06.490
is equal to a constant
times the other solution.

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:14.890
So you do the work, and
that's what comes out.

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:19.290
Once you've shown that one
is proportional to the other,

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:21.820
we've declared in
quantum mechanics

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:25.030
that two wave functions
that differ by a constant

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:27.580
have exactly the same physics.

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:31.130
You can normalize it,
and normalize them.

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:33.030
And the constant
can be just a phase,

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:34.540
but the phase doesn't matter.

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:38.130
So those two wave functions
are really the same.

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:40.610
So you get a contradiction.

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:42.420
You thought they were different.

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:46.770
But the difference
is just too trivial,

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:50.610
and therefore they are really
the same wave function.

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:52.950
Because we've said that
two wave functions that

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:56.190
differ by a constant
should be identified.

00:07:56.190 --> 00:07:58.410
So that's this theorem.

00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:01.640
And it's a key theorem.

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:10.470
Let's go to the next theorem
that is also important.

00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:11.733
So theorem two.

00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:31.185
Energy eigenstates sine f of
x can be chosen to be real.

00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:40.850
So here it is.

00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:43.650
We mentioned that this
differential equation

00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:45.980
allows for real solutions.

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:49.360
There's no contradiction,
because there's no i in there.

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:52.090
But now we say more.

00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:56.660
That even if you find
a complex solution,

00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:59.070
you can work with
real solutions.

00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:01.590
So what is the strategy here?

00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:02.990
Again strategy.

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:13.005
To have you get a
complex solution.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.160
Sine f of x.

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:28.520
And then you go about
to prove that actually

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:32.240
this complex solution
implies the existence of two

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:34.160
real solutions.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:42.200
So this complex solution
implies existence

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:43.780
of two real solutions.

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:54.960
And moreover, two real-- I
should say it better here--

00:09:54.960 --> 00:10:00.450
degenerate solutions.

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:02.470
How could you prove that?

00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:05.010
Well, it probably
would occur to you

00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:08.910
that you would take a solution
and say, oh, this solves it.

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:13.940
Then you would show that sine
star also solves this equation.

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:17.870
And then by linearity of
the Schrodinger equation,

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:23.270
you could form what we would
call the real solution formed

00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:30.980
by taking sine plus sine
star and adding them.

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:37.450
Or the real solution that
comes from the imaginary part.

00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:42.380
You see the real and imaginary
parts of a complex number

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:43.920
are real.

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:46.490
So is the case here as well.

00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:51.180
That they can take sine and
sine star that are different.

00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:53.930
And the sum is real
by construction.

00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:57.700
You put the star, and
recalling that star of star

00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:02.400
gives nothing, you see that this
function is equal to its star.

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:03.880
So it's real.

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:05.370
So is this one.

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:17.750
This function, which is the
imaginary part of the solution

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:20.760
that you had, is also real.

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:23.270
So you get two real solutions.

00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:27.850
Moreover, you can show
that sine and sine star

00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:29.100
have the same energy.

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:32.780
Therefore sine r and sine
m have the same energy.

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:35.770
So I'm really
skipping very little.

00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:38.940
But I don't want to
clutter the blackboard

00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:42.340
with the whole derivation
at this moment.

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:43.825
So here is the strategy.

00:11:43.825 --> 00:11:47.790
A complex solution implies
two real solutions.

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:51.480
And therefore, since
you have real solutions,

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:55.160
you can always choose
them to be real.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:56.740
No loss of generality.

00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:58.560
You had a complex solution.

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:00.870
You say, I like
just real solutions.

00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:02.700
And you chose your
two real solutions.

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:03.600
You give them.

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:06.850
You've given the whole thing.

00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:10.570
But then there is
a nice corollary

00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:14.370
for the case of one
dimension bound states.

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:20.590
So this is the part that is
perhaps somewhat interesting.

00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:24.070
And the corollary
is that if you're

00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:29.530
talking bound states
of one dimension,

00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:37.970
any solution is equal to a
real solution up to a constant.

00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:39.980
You may say, well
what's the difference?

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:45.970
Let's write it down
and look at it.

00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:58.480
Corollary for bound states of
one dimensional potentials.

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:23.940
Any solution is, up to a phase,
equal to a real solution.

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:37.840
So how does that go?

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:43.580
Maybe we can use more
of this blackboard.

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:46.710
Why would any solution
be, up to a phase,

00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:48.020
equal to a real solution?

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:50.340
OK.

00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:52.870
Suppose you have these
two solutions here.

00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:55.592
Well this is real, so
that's trivially true.

00:13:55.592 --> 00:13:56.300
And this is real.

00:13:56.300 --> 00:14:00.270
But what if I put a linear
combination of them?

00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:02.620
Or take the original
complex solution?

00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:06.880
Why would it be, up to a phase,
equal to a real solution?

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:08.800
The answer is the following.

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:13.470
Because of theorem and,
that there's no degeneracy,

00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:17.180
you've got two
solutions that claim

00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:20.840
to be different and degenerate.

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:22.890
But that can't be.

00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:31.550
So by theorem one, you must
have that-- in the notations,

00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:36.310
I have here-- sine
imaginary of x

00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:41.245
must be equal to a constant
times sine real of x.

00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:54.960
Now if these function's
anyway are real,

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:57.120
the constant here must be real.

00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:05.630
Therefore, even if you form
the original complex solution,

00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:14.501
sine, which is sine real
plus i sine imaginary.

00:15:14.501 --> 00:15:16.470
You can check that.

00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:19.940
It's clear by definition that
that's the way it should be.

00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:25.350
If you think this, this
is equal to 1 plus i times

00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:30.860
c times sine real of x.

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:35.940
Therefore this is equal
to a constant times

00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:39.250
the phase of-- this
is a complex number.

00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:43.070
So this is yet another
constant that we

00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:52.000
could say, the norm of 1 plus
i c times some phase times sine

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.460
r of x.

00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:58.000
So you see that any solution,
any linear combination,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.080
in fact, with any numbers of
sine r and sine imaginary,

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:07.760
will be a constant times
a phase times this thing.

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:13.020
So it is really
just real anyway.

00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:17.455
So you can just
have one solution.

00:16:17.455 --> 00:16:19.950
And any solution
that you may write,

00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:23.960
that represents a bound
state, is, up to a phase,

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:25.115
equal to a real solution.

00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:30.780
OK.

00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:34.690
So that's our theorem two.

00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:35.760
Theorem three.

00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:47.980
It's also very famous.

00:16:47.980 --> 00:17:01.640
If the potential V of x is
even-- that is, V of minus x

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:14.089
is equal to V of x-- the
eigenstate can be chosen

00:17:14.089 --> 00:17:26.730
to be even or odd
under x2 minus x.

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:32.220
OK.

00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:39.040
So here is another claim.

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:41.480
So the potential is even.

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:44.210
There's no theorem for
all the potentials.

00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:47.170
No clear theorems, no simple
theorems for all the--

00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:50.580
but if the potential
is even, the claim

00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:55.280
is that you can choose
eigenstates to be even or odd.

00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:58.460
The word chosen is
very important here.

00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:00.800
Otherwise, this would not
be a precise statement.

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:04.160
You cannot say the
eigenstates are even or odd.

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:06.400
You can choose them to be.

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:08.460
So how does the proof go?

00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:18.200
Strategy begin with
a wave function,

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:22.840
sine of x, that is
neither even nor odd.

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:33.580
And then you do a little work
with the Schrodinger equation.

00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:36.630
Take the Schrodinger
equation, change all x's

00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:42.180
to minus x's and show that,
in fact, not only is sine

00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:48.640
of x a solution, but sine of
minus x is also a solution.

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:50.720
With the same energy.

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:58.250
So prove that sine of
minus x is a solution

00:18:58.250 --> 00:18:59.220
with the same energy.

00:19:07.930 --> 00:19:12.550
And in this case, of
course, we can already

00:19:12.550 --> 00:19:15.090
have shown that we
can choose these wave

00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:16.470
functions to be real.

00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:21.520
So we can choose all of these
wave functions to be real.

00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:24.040
And what do we do next?

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:28.200
If we have these two solutions
with the same energy,

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:31.710
then you can build
of sine s, which

00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:36.800
is 1/2 of sine of x
plus sine of minus x.

00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:43.200
And of sine a.

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:46.500
s for symmetric, and
a for anti-symmetric.

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:50.750
And of sine a,
that is 1/2 of sine

00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:57.900
of x minus sine of minus x.

00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:02.930
And this tool
would be this even,

00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:06.260
under the exchange
of x for minus x.

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:12.350
This one odd, under the
exchange of x for minus x.

00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:15.700
And both would be
solutions by superposition.

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:17.805
And both would have
the same energy.

00:20:21.130 --> 00:20:29.400
So that's the end of the theorem
because then these things are

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:32.640
even or odd and have
the same energy.

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:39.300
So the solutions can be chosen
to be even or odd under x.

00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:43.120
So if you've proven this,
you've got it already.

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:44.805
But now we get the corollary.

00:20:49.490 --> 00:21:01.660
For bound states
in one dimension,

00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:05.900
the solutions not
anymore the word chosen.

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:08.710
We can delete the word chosen.

00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:13.465
The solutions are
either odd or even.

00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:29.810
So it's a lot stronger.

00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:32.380
It's not anymore, you
can choose them to be,

00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:35.981
but a general one is
neither odd nor even.

00:21:35.981 --> 00:21:36.480
No.

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:39.660
You try to find the solution
that is neither odd nor even,

00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:41.800
and you can't find it.

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:42.930
So it's very strong.

00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:44.216
Yes?

00:21:44.216 --> 00:21:46.070
AUDIENCE: Is this
for even potentials?

00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:47.195
PROFESSOR: Even potentials.

00:21:47.195 --> 00:21:47.970
Yes.

00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:52.980
For bound states in one
dimension with even potentials.

00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:54.255
V of x.

00:21:54.255 --> 00:21:56.770
V of minus x equal V of x.

00:21:56.770 --> 00:21:58.940
Yes.

00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:01.720
So how do we show that?

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:07.500
Well, again, you've
got two solutions here

00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:10.750
that are degenerate that
have the same energy.

00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:13.730
Sine of x and sine of minus x.

00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:17.780
So given that there's
no degeneracy in one

00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:21.620
dimensional problems, this thing
that they have the same energy,

00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:23.950
the only thing that
can be happening

00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:30.400
is that sine of minus x is equal
to a constant times sine of x.

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:33.670
Where this constant is real.

00:22:33.670 --> 00:22:34.630
Why real?

00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:37.590
Because we said already
by the previously theorem,

00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:40.590
wave functions can
be chosen to be real.

00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:45.930
So you've got this thing
already that this is true.

00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:51.670
Sine of minus x is equal
to c times sine of x.

00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:55.040
Which, if you use this
property again by saying,

00:22:55.040 --> 00:23:03.400
oh, but sine of x is equal
to c times sine of minus x.

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:06.100
Basically, what this says
is that you can change

00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:09.480
the sign of the argument
by putting an extra c.

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:13.530
So you do it again, sine
of x is equal to this.

00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:18.820
So this is c squared
times sine of minus x.

00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:23.580
So c squared must be equal to 1.

00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:28.290
And therefore c is equal
to either plus or minus 1.

00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:30.030
No other option.

00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:35.060
So the functions are
either even or odd,

00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:38.750
but they can't be arbitrary.

00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:41.270
This point is
sufficiently settled

00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:44.760
that part two
general exam at MIT

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:48.910
10 years ago had a
question like that.

00:23:48.910 --> 00:23:51.700
And the person that
invented the problem

00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:53.990
claimed that there
would be a solution that

00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:57.580
could be neither even nor odd.

00:23:57.580 --> 00:24:01.530
So even faculty members at
MIT sometimes get this wrong.

00:24:01.530 --> 00:24:06.260
It's not as weak as
this, that can be chosen.

00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:11.247
But it's really either
or other in the case

00:24:11.247 --> 00:24:12.205
you have one dimension.

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:16.630
OK.

00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:20.730
So these are our main theorems.

00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:23.670
And we're going to
proceed now by clarifying

00:24:23.670 --> 00:24:26.090
a little more the
nature of the spectrum.

00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:27.225
So are there questions?

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:33.180
Yes?

00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:34.930
AUDIENCE: Can you give
an example of state

00:24:34.930 --> 00:24:36.857
that's not bound?

00:24:36.857 --> 00:24:37.440
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:40.220
The question is can
I give an example

00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:42.870
of a state that is not bound?

00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:43.700
Yes.

00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:45.310
We can give such state.

00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:47.990
You have a potential like this.

00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:51.350
And you have an
energy like that.

00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:53.920
And then the wave function
could look like this.

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:55.940
Then do something like that.

00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:59.260
And then look like that.

00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:02.637
It just doesn't vanish
when you go to infinity.

00:25:02.637 --> 00:25:04.220
AUDIENCE: So that
can't be normalized?

00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:05.640
PROFESSOR: Can't be normalized.

00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:06.230
That's right.

00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:07.980
If it's not bound, it
can't be normalized.

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:16.212
Other questions?

00:25:16.212 --> 00:25:17.156
Yes?

00:25:17.156 --> 00:25:20.932
AUDIENCE: So you can't really
represent-- it's doesn't really

00:25:20.932 --> 00:25:24.250
represent single particles,
more like a stream of particles?

00:25:24.250 --> 00:25:24.900
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:27.680
So it doesn't represent
a single particle.

00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:30.550
Now trying to interpret it
as a stream of particles

00:25:30.550 --> 00:25:32.990
is a little delicate.

00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:37.320
So what we usually do is
we build superpositions

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:42.160
of those states that can
represent a localized thing.

00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:45.130
But it's true that,
morally speaking,

00:25:45.130 --> 00:25:49.370
it seems to represent
more than one particle.

00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:50.510
OK.

00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:53.950
So now we talk a little about
the nature of the spectrum.

00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:12.040
So what do we want to say here?

00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:16.210
We want to go back to the
Schrodinger equation here.

00:26:16.210 --> 00:26:21.050
And just move one term
to the right hand side.

00:26:21.050 --> 00:26:24.160
And just see what
can happen in terms

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:26.860
of singularities
and discontinuities.

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:40.040
So first of all, we
always begin with the idea

00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:44.840
that sine must be continuous.

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:48.060
And the reason sine
must be continuous is

00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:53.930
that we don't want
singularities worse

00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:57.110
than delta functions
in potentials.

00:26:57.110 --> 00:27:03.010
If a function is
continuous, the derivative

00:27:03.010 --> 00:27:06.170
might be discontinuous,
and the second derivative

00:27:06.170 --> 00:27:08.760
would have a delta function.

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:11.540
So the second derivative
would have a delta function.

00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:14.760
But if the function is
not even continuous,

00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:18.480
the second derivative would have
derivatives of delta functions.

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:21.230
So somehow the potential
would have to have that.

00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:22.570
And we don't want it.

00:27:22.570 --> 00:27:27.206
So to simplify our life, we say
that sine must be continuous.

00:27:32.910 --> 00:27:39.060
Now if sine is
continuous, we will

00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:44.850
consider several possibilities,
possibilities for V,

00:27:44.850 --> 00:27:51.370
possibilities for V of x.

00:27:51.370 --> 00:27:55.715
So first possibility--
one, V is continuous.

00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:03.910
So psi is continuous,
and V is continuous.

00:28:03.910 --> 00:28:07.200
If psi is continuous
and V is continuous,

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:08.610
this product is continuous.

00:28:08.610 --> 00:28:11.230
Psi double prime is continuous.

00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:13.230
And psi prime is continuous.

00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:22.810
Two, V has finite jumps.

00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:35.830
Well, if V has finite jumps,
and psi is continuous,

00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:39.590
this product has finite jumps.

00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:44.760
So psi double prime
has finite jumps.

00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:49.360
If psi prime has
finite jumps, the worst

00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:53.715
is that psi prime still
must be continuous.

00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:59.410
But it changes.

00:28:59.410 --> 00:29:02.520
Psi prime could look like
that, could have a corner.

00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:04.620
But it cannot be
worse than that.

00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:10.970
Because if V has finite
jumps, if psi double

00:29:10.970 --> 00:29:15.025
prime has finite jumps, and if
psi prime is not continuous,

00:29:15.025 --> 00:29:16.880
it would have delta functions.

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:22.110
So for these two conditions,
continuous or even

00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:27.760
finite jumps, psi prime
is still continuous.

00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:32.250
Things change qualitatively if
three, V has delta functions.

00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:44.050
If V has a delta
function, then psi

00:29:44.050 --> 00:29:47.670
double prime has
a delta function.

00:29:47.670 --> 00:29:52.410
And psi prime therefore jumps.

00:29:52.410 --> 00:29:54.400
Psi prime is not continuous.

00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:56.860
Psi prime jumps.

00:29:56.860 --> 00:30:00.090
This may be reminiscent
to you whenever

00:30:00.090 --> 00:30:03.290
you had to solve the
problem of a bound state

00:30:03.290 --> 00:30:05.510
of a delta function,
you got a wave function

00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:10.220
that looked like this in
which psi prime jumps.

00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:11.520
And it has to jump.

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:15.970
Because psi double prime
has a delta function.

00:30:15.970 --> 00:30:19.940
Another case in
which psi prime jumps

00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:22.450
is for if V has a hard wall.

00:30:26.530 --> 00:30:30.835
That is, the potential suddenly
at one point becomes infinite,

00:30:30.835 --> 00:30:34.970
and it prevents the
particle from moving across.

00:30:34.970 --> 00:30:38.470
A hard wall is a
place, as you remember

00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:41.350
in the infinite square
well, in which the wave

00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:44.890
function vanishes, but the
derivative doesn't vanish.

00:30:44.890 --> 00:30:49.370
So you could say that
psi is 0 here outside.

00:30:49.370 --> 00:30:55.160
Psi prime, then, jumps
in that it's non-0 here

00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:56.960
and it's 0 afterwards.

00:30:56.960 --> 00:31:02.850
So now, you could
object to what I'm

00:31:02.850 --> 00:31:06.730
saying by explaining that,
well, we shouldn't talk

00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:09.950
about the wave function
beyond the hard wall.

00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:12.010
And in some sense, you're right.

00:31:12.010 --> 00:31:14.850
But suppose we do and we say
the wave function is just

00:31:14.850 --> 00:31:18.390
0 everywhere, we see
that psi prime jumps.

00:31:18.390 --> 00:31:23.640
So really, psi prime jumps.

00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:27.250
So this is as bad
as things can get.

00:31:27.250 --> 00:31:33.570
So we can summarize this
in just one sentence.

00:31:33.570 --> 00:31:39.390
And the sentence reads,
psi and psi prime

00:31:39.390 --> 00:31:57.510
are continuous unless V has
delta functions or hard walls,

00:31:57.510 --> 00:32:07.120
in which case psi prime
can have finite jumps.

00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:19.770
So basically, psi and
psi prime, continuous.

00:32:19.770 --> 00:32:25.850
Exceptions-- delta functions
and hard walls, and psi prime

00:32:25.850 --> 00:32:28.200
can change.

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:30.860
So questions.

00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:32.292
There was a question before.

00:32:32.292 --> 00:32:33.250
Maybe it's still there.

00:32:33.250 --> 00:32:33.860
Yes.

00:32:33.860 --> 00:32:37.668
AUDIENCE: Do you absolutely
need that function [INAUDIBLE]?

00:32:37.668 --> 00:32:40.980
Or do we just assume
that [INAUDIBLE]?

00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:43.150
PROFESSOR: We assume it--
so the question is, do I

00:32:43.150 --> 00:32:46.960
need that in absolute generality
to do quantum mechanics?

00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:49.440
I don't think so.

00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:53.185
I presume you could discuss
some potentials that

00:32:53.185 --> 00:32:56.610
lead to psi that
are not continuous

00:32:56.610 --> 00:32:58.640
and still make sense.

00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:00.320
But we will not discuss them.

00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:03.495
And actually, I don't think
I've encountered any of those.

00:33:06.587 --> 00:33:08.326
Yes.

00:33:08.326 --> 00:33:09.700
AUDIENCE: Can you
give an example

00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:12.015
of a physical system whose
potential is well approximated

00:33:12.015 --> 00:33:13.348
by a delta function [INAUDIBLE]?

00:33:16.150 --> 00:33:24.540
PROFESSOR: Yes, there
are systems like that.

00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:28.450
For example, this one
that is somewhat well

00:33:28.450 --> 00:33:30.790
approximated by
a delta function.

00:33:30.790 --> 00:33:34.000
For example, a
nucleus sometimes is

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:38.990
considered to be like a
spherical cavity in which

00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:42.470
particles are bound by a deep
potential and don't escape.

00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:46.250
So the nuclei are moving
like that and don't escape.

00:33:46.250 --> 00:33:49.030
In that case, it would be
a three dimensional delta

00:33:49.030 --> 00:33:53.410
function that vanishes
at the origin.

00:33:53.410 --> 00:33:56.070
I presume there
are many examples.

00:33:56.070 --> 00:33:59.560
Any potential that
sort of begins

00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:02.850
like a finite square well
that is sufficiently deep

00:34:02.850 --> 00:34:07.235
will start to look like a
delta function after awhile.

00:34:07.235 --> 00:34:08.110
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:12.530 --> 00:34:17.929
PROFESSOR: Well, it's again
neither-- yeah, I guess so.

00:34:17.929 --> 00:34:21.719
But it depends how
big is this psi.

00:34:21.719 --> 00:34:26.050
So yeah, probably you're right.

00:34:26.050 --> 00:34:29.960
This looks a little more like
an analog of a hard wall.

00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:33.690
But if a hard wall is
very narrow and very deep,

00:34:33.690 --> 00:34:35.300
it looks like a delta function.

00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:38.090
So it's idealizations for sure.

00:34:38.090 --> 00:34:42.310
But I'm sure we could
get a better example.

00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:45.580
And I'll try to find one.

00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:48.310
Now, the next
thing we want to do

00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:52.800
is give you intuition for
this incredible result

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:56.380
that there's no degeneratives
in one dimensional potentials.

00:34:56.380 --> 00:35:02.450
That is not to say that the
proof is not good enough.

00:35:02.450 --> 00:35:07.440
It is just to say that
we can illustrate that

00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:09.920
without going into a
mathematical proof that

00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:12.010
is more complicated.

00:35:12.010 --> 00:35:14.970
So how do we do that?

00:35:14.970 --> 00:35:17.980
We'll consider the following
case, a simple case,

00:35:17.980 --> 00:35:23.670
an example of a
potential of this form.

00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:26.260
V of x-- this is x.

00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:27.800
And here is V of x.

00:35:31.390 --> 00:35:36.410
And we will try to find a
solution with some energy that

00:35:36.410 --> 00:35:42.780
is like that, an energy that is
right there below the barrier.

00:35:45.740 --> 00:35:47.720
So this would be a bound state.

00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:48.520
Why?

00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:52.332
Because solutions
here are exponentials

00:35:52.332 --> 00:35:54.820
that decay,
exponentials that decay.

00:35:54.820 --> 00:35:57.500
And here, the wave
function would

00:35:57.500 --> 00:35:59.970
be oscillating presumably.

00:35:59.970 --> 00:36:02.900
So the wave functions
go to 0 and infinity.

00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:04.190
You could get a bound state.

00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:07.150
So let's see how we
get a bound state.

00:36:07.150 --> 00:36:08.970
Now, the argument
I'm going to follow

00:36:08.970 --> 00:36:11.110
is just an elaboration
of something

00:36:11.110 --> 00:36:13.450
you can read in Shankar.

00:36:13.450 --> 00:36:16.900
And it's a nice and
simple argument.

00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:24.000
So we want to understand why we
would get here no degeneracies.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.440
Or even more-- in fact
not just no degeneracies,

00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:32.050
but the spectrum is quantized.

00:36:32.050 --> 00:36:35.710
That is, you find one energy,
and then another energy maybe,

00:36:35.710 --> 00:36:37.730
and another energy.

00:36:37.730 --> 00:36:39.590
So how do we see that?

00:36:39.590 --> 00:36:43.690
Well, you look at the way
you can write solutions

00:36:43.690 --> 00:36:46.750
and count the parameters
of the solutions

00:36:46.750 --> 00:36:50.980
and try to see how many
conditions you have to satisfy.

00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:55.980
So here, the wave function
would be a decay in exponential.

00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:59.160
A decay in exponential
is of the form

00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:06.040
alpha e to the K, kappa, x.

00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:07.730
Because x here is negative.

00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:11.260
So this decays as x
goes to minus infinity

00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:12.810
if kappa is positive.

00:37:12.810 --> 00:37:15.170
And that's how a solution looks.

00:37:15.170 --> 00:37:19.140
You need one coefficient here
to determine this solutions.

00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:20.604
So I'll put a 1 here.

00:37:23.330 --> 00:37:25.650
Now, in here, the
solution is oscillatory.

00:37:25.650 --> 00:37:29.012
So it's a sine plus cosine.

00:37:29.012 --> 00:37:30.220
So you need two coefficients.

00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:37.930
In here, the solution
must again be decaying.

00:37:37.930 --> 00:37:40.810
And therefore, you just
need one coefficient.

00:37:40.810 --> 00:37:45.150
Again, this time it would
be a beta e to the minus Kx.

00:37:45.150 --> 00:37:46.870
The fact that this
potential looks

00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:50.350
symmetric-- I'm
not assuming it is.

00:37:50.350 --> 00:37:50.920
Yes.

00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:52.544
AUDIENCE: Won't one
of the coefficients

00:37:52.544 --> 00:37:53.960
be unconstrained
by normalization?

00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:56.160
Isn't one just the
normalization factor?

00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:58.720
PROFESSOR: OK, how
about normalization?

00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:04.600
Indeed, we have one,
two, and two and one, so

00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:08.230
a total of four coefficients,
four parameters.

00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:17.710
But indeed, suppose you
wrote your whole solution.

00:38:17.710 --> 00:38:21.800
You could say, look, let me
divide this solution by 3.

00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:24.460
That's an equivalent solution.

00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:27.350
I'm just checking if it solves
the Schrodinger equation.

00:38:27.350 --> 00:38:28.520
That's all I have to check.

00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:30.910
I don't have to
check normalization.

00:38:30.910 --> 00:38:34.870
Normalization, in fact, is
sort of irrelevant here.

00:38:34.870 --> 00:38:37.040
You just need to know
if a bound state exists.

00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:42.200
So indeed, even though you have
these four parameters, given

00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:45.670
that you can multiply the
solution by a constant,

00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:51.455
there's just three
constants to fix.

00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:58.660
Four parameters
via normalization

00:38:58.660 --> 00:39:02.540
or the multiplication by
any constant-- just three

00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:04.050
constants to fix.

00:39:04.050 --> 00:39:07.910
But this potential
is nice enough

00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:10.760
that psi and psi prime
must be continuous.

00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:15.690
So you get two conditions
here and two conditions here.

00:39:15.690 --> 00:39:19.680
So four conditions-- continuity
of psi and psi prime,

00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:22.650
continuity of psi and psi
prime, four conditions.

00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:27.730
So what did we get?

00:39:27.730 --> 00:39:30.120
We got in trouble.

00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:34.700
We've shown that this is
unsolvable in general.

00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:38.990
Because there are more
conditions than parameters.

00:39:38.990 --> 00:39:41.350
Now, this equation could
to be a little peculiar.

00:39:41.350 --> 00:39:43.330
Maybe this is not
completely general.

00:39:43.330 --> 00:39:47.810
But you seem to have more
conditions than parameters.

00:39:47.810 --> 00:39:51.210
But here comes the catch.

00:39:51.210 --> 00:39:55.830
The solution really
is determined.

00:39:55.830 --> 00:39:58.670
Like kappa-- do you know kappa?

00:39:58.670 --> 00:40:02.960
Well, you know kappa if you
know the energy of the solution.

00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:05.210
Kappa is determined by the
energy of the solution.

00:40:05.210 --> 00:40:08.890
So some parameters in the
solution depend on the energy.

00:40:08.890 --> 00:40:12.150
So the way we have
to think of this

00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:16.220
is that in fact three constants
to fix, but four conditions.

00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:18.510
So we really need
four constants to fix.

00:40:18.510 --> 00:40:22.090
And the fourth
constant is the energy.

00:40:22.090 --> 00:40:24.980
So the energy is the
fourth constant to fix.

00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:28.040
And with four conditions,
these three constants

00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:32.450
that we had there and the
energy, they can just be fixed.

00:40:32.450 --> 00:40:35.670
So the solution
should fix the energy

00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:39.080
and should fix this coefficient.

00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:50.820
So the solution exists for
some energy, or possibly

00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:54.560
some values of the energies, but
not all values of the energy.

00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:59.030
So this shows, or at least
very clearly illustrates,

00:40:59.030 --> 00:41:04.310
that you are going to find sets
of energies for which you have

00:41:04.310 --> 00:41:08.030
solutions depending on
how the equations look,

00:41:08.030 --> 00:41:09.920
and one solution each time.

00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:17.466
So you get what is called
a discrete non-degenerate

00:41:17.466 --> 00:41:17.965
spectrum.

00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:29.110
Now, there are more
cases to discuss,

00:41:29.110 --> 00:41:31.630
the case in which you
have just the step,

00:41:31.630 --> 00:41:35.540
or the case in which you
have three bound states.

00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:43.340
And I will not do them
but state the results.

00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:46.940
Again, all that I
don't do explicitly

00:41:46.940 --> 00:41:49.180
can be found in the notes.

00:41:49.180 --> 00:41:55.200
So you would look at them later.

00:41:55.200 --> 00:42:00.940
And so here is the second
case, a potential like this

00:42:00.940 --> 00:42:06.460
and an energy like
that, energy level.

00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:10.590
And what you get here is that
in fact, doing the counting

00:42:10.590 --> 00:42:12.700
and analyzing the
boundary conditions,

00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:15.010
you should do it by yourselves.

00:42:15.010 --> 00:42:17.810
But you will see the
answers in the notes.

00:42:17.810 --> 00:42:26.000
You get here continuous
spectrum, non-degenerate.

00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:35.930
So you will get a
solution for every value

00:42:35.930 --> 00:42:40.850
of the energy-- that's to mean,
continuous spectrum-- and one

00:42:40.850 --> 00:42:43.820
solution each time.

00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:52.770
Finally, this case-- if you
have an energy like this,

00:42:52.770 --> 00:43:11.350
e, you get continuous spectrum
and doubly degenerate,

00:43:11.350 --> 00:43:12.320
so two solutions.

00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:25.190
Now, after this,
there's one more result

00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:30.480
that qualifies as a theorem.

00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:35.030
And it's hard to
prove rigorously.

00:43:35.030 --> 00:43:39.650
I will not attempt to prove
it here nor even in the notes.

00:43:39.650 --> 00:43:40.700
It's hard enough.

00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:45.110
So this theorem has
to do with nodes.

00:43:45.110 --> 00:43:58.930
Theorem-- so if you have
the discrete bound state

00:43:58.930 --> 00:44:11.560
spectrum of a one
dimensional potential,

00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:22.620
and you list the energies
E1 less than E2 less than E3

00:44:22.620 --> 00:44:26.080
like that, E1 is the
ground state energy.

00:44:31.940 --> 00:44:34.380
Remember, this
spectrum is discrete.

00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:36.740
So this is less than
E2, less than E3,

00:44:36.740 --> 00:44:40.430
and it goes on like that,
the ground state energy.

00:44:40.430 --> 00:44:45.680
Then, you have associated wave
functions, energy eigenstates

00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:51.470
psi 1 of x, psi 2
of x, psi 3 of x.

00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:56.890
Here is the theorem.

00:44:56.890 --> 00:45:01.220
The theorem tells you something
about the vanishing of the wave

00:45:01.220 --> 00:45:01.990
function.

00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:09.530
It says that psi 1 has no nodes.

00:45:09.530 --> 00:45:14.930
Psi 2 has one node.

00:45:14.930 --> 00:45:19.570
Psi 3 has two nodes.

00:45:19.570 --> 00:45:27.565
And so it goes so that psi
n has n minus one node.

00:45:27.565 --> 00:45:34.500
So psi n is greater
than-- well, it's correct.

00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:41.070
Any n greater or equal
to 1 has n minus 1 nodes.

00:45:41.070 --> 00:45:46.330
Now, there are several
ways people show this.

00:45:46.330 --> 00:45:52.090
Mathematicians show it in
a rather delicate analysis.

00:45:52.090 --> 00:45:55.210
Physicists have an
argument as well

00:45:55.210 --> 00:46:02.800
for this, which is based on
approximating any potential

00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:05.950
by infinite square
wells to begin with.

00:46:05.950 --> 00:46:09.960
So suppose you have a
potential like that.

00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:14.700
Well, think of it as first being
a little potential like that,

00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:16.700
an infinite square well.

00:46:16.700 --> 00:46:21.310
And you start making the window
of the square well bigger.

00:46:21.310 --> 00:46:25.060
The argument-- it's
a neat argument.

00:46:25.060 --> 00:46:28.650
Maybe you can discuss
it in recitation.

00:46:28.650 --> 00:46:30.470
I would suggest that.

00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:31.690
It's a good argument.

00:46:31.690 --> 00:46:33.730
But it's not rigorous.

00:46:33.730 --> 00:46:37.040
But still, one can do
something like that.

00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:38.140
You make it grow.

00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:41.330
And what you know is that
the infinite square well,

00:46:41.330 --> 00:46:43.620
the first wave
function has no node.

00:46:43.620 --> 00:46:48.660
And as you change the screen to
make the potential really what

00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:52.230
it's supposed to be and not
just that of a square well,

00:46:52.230 --> 00:46:57.080
the wave function
cannot gain a node.

00:46:57.080 --> 00:47:00.100
On the other hand, what you
will show in the homework

00:47:00.100 --> 00:47:04.230
is something that is
a partial result which

00:47:04.230 --> 00:47:10.890
says that the
solution with n plus 1

00:47:10.890 --> 00:47:17.200
has at least one more node
than the solution with n.

00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:20.350
So it's part of
what you can show.

00:47:20.350 --> 00:47:22.130
And it doesn't take
too much effort.

00:47:22.130 --> 00:47:23.540
And you can prove it rigorously.

00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:25.740
So we will assign
that eventually

00:47:25.740 --> 00:47:26.940
for a homework to do.

00:47:31.950 --> 00:47:34.630
In the homework that you
have for the first homework,

00:47:34.630 --> 00:47:39.360
you also have a problem
with delta functions.

00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:43.660
And I suggest that you
read the notes that

00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:46.110
will be posted today.

00:47:46.110 --> 00:47:49.030
Because there's an example
there with delta functions.

00:47:49.030 --> 00:47:51.490
If you study that
example, you'll

00:47:51.490 --> 00:47:54.980
find the problem
quite easy to solve.

00:47:54.980 --> 00:47:56.540
You may have solved already.

00:47:56.540 --> 00:48:00.620
Some of you are very eager to
get going with the homework.

00:48:00.620 --> 00:48:07.590
So it's something you
can study first, and then

00:48:07.590 --> 00:48:10.920
make your life a little easier.

00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:17.710
So what we're going to do now
for the rest of the lecture

00:48:17.710 --> 00:48:20.330
is consider the
variational problem, which

00:48:20.330 --> 00:48:24.100
is something you probably
haven't seen before,

00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:25.475
the variational problem.

00:48:38.450 --> 00:48:43.410
This problem has to do with
calculus of variations.

00:48:43.410 --> 00:48:45.680
Now, calculus of
variations is something

00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:49.200
considered fairly advanced.

00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:52.535
And therefore, as
you will see, we

00:48:52.535 --> 00:48:57.390
will avoid some of the major
difficulties of calculus

00:48:57.390 --> 00:49:01.930
of variations in our discussion
of the variational principle.

00:49:01.930 --> 00:49:11.860
But I wanted to mention a
little story about this problem.

00:49:11.860 --> 00:49:18.590
So this calculus of variations
is a more complicated version

00:49:18.590 --> 00:49:26.140
of maxima and minima in which in
maxima and minima of functions

00:49:26.140 --> 00:49:27.800
you look at the function.

00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:30.580
And if you could plot it, you
could say, here's a maximum,

00:49:30.580 --> 00:49:32.360
here's a minimum.

00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:35.427
If you want to figure out
where they are, you know.

00:49:35.427 --> 00:49:38.050
You take a derivative,
set it equal to 0,

00:49:38.050 --> 00:49:41.300
you find the maxima and minima.

00:49:41.300 --> 00:49:44.030
So the typical
calculus problem is

00:49:44.030 --> 00:49:45.635
one in which you
have a function,

00:49:45.635 --> 00:49:47.930
and you want the
maxima and minima.

00:49:47.930 --> 00:49:51.920
The variational
problem is a problem

00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:56.190
in which you want to maximize
or minimize something.

00:49:56.190 --> 00:50:00.890
But what you don't know is not
where the maximum or minimum

00:50:00.890 --> 00:50:04.440
occurs, but which
kind of function

00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:07.090
will give you this
maximum or minimum.

00:50:07.090 --> 00:50:09.890
So your unknown is
not a point where

00:50:09.890 --> 00:50:13.790
there's a maximum or a
minimum but a function where

00:50:13.790 --> 00:50:16.310
there is a maximum
and a minimum.

00:50:16.310 --> 00:50:20.660
So it's slightly
more complicated.

00:50:20.660 --> 00:50:22.940
So this is the
calculus of variations.

00:50:22.940 --> 00:50:28.290
And people wonder
when did it start.

00:50:28.290 --> 00:50:31.530
It actually seems to have
first been discussed by Newton.

00:50:31.530 --> 00:50:36.080
And it's quite an
interesting story.

00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:39.060
Newton was trying to
understand apparently

00:50:39.060 --> 00:50:40.470
the following problem.

00:50:40.470 --> 00:50:49.610
If you would have a cross
sectional area like this,

00:50:49.610 --> 00:50:53.700
he asked the question,
how should you

00:50:53.700 --> 00:50:59.640
make a solid out of this
by tapering it and ending

00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:02.810
with this, tapering
it, in such a way

00:51:02.810 --> 00:51:06.070
that as it moves
in a viscous fluid,

00:51:06.070 --> 00:51:10.980
the resistance is the minimum
possible-- very complicated

00:51:10.980 --> 00:51:12.950
problem.

00:51:12.950 --> 00:51:16.180
And as you can imagine, this
is a complicated problem

00:51:16.180 --> 00:51:19.590
because you're trying to find
a shape-- not just a maximum

00:51:19.590 --> 00:51:22.060
or a minimum of a
function but what

00:51:22.060 --> 00:51:25.930
shape maximizes
or minimizes this.

00:51:25.930 --> 00:51:28.600
So apparently, he
solved the problem

00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:33.950
and wrote it in Principia but
didn't explain his solution.

00:51:33.950 --> 00:51:36.650
And people for years were
trying to figure it out.

00:51:36.650 --> 00:51:41.130
And nobody could figure
out how he did it.

00:51:41.130 --> 00:51:47.710
Then, the story goes that this
mathematician Johann Bernoulli

00:51:47.710 --> 00:51:53.870
in 1696 came up with a
challenge to all mathematicians.

00:51:53.870 --> 00:51:56.380
At that time, people
would announce a problem

00:51:56.380 --> 00:51:59.110
and challenge to
see who's smart,

00:51:59.110 --> 00:52:01.580
who can solve this problem.

00:52:01.580 --> 00:52:13.380
So Johann Bernoulli
in around 1696

00:52:13.380 --> 00:52:18.410
poses a problem of, you're
given two points in the plane,

00:52:18.410 --> 00:52:23.440
in the vertical plane like
this blackboard, point this, A,

00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:28.560
and point B in here.

00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:32.260
You must design the
curve of shortest time

00:52:32.260 --> 00:52:35.430
for fall, so some curve here.

00:52:35.430 --> 00:52:37.465
If you put an object
and let it fall,

00:52:37.465 --> 00:52:42.270
it will get the fastest
to that point, so maybe

00:52:42.270 --> 00:52:44.950
something that looks like this.

00:52:44.950 --> 00:52:49.860
It's a complicated curve, or
at least not all that simple.

00:52:49.860 --> 00:52:56.330
And he asked all the
people to solve it,

00:52:56.330 --> 00:53:00.740
gave them one year to solve it.

00:53:00.740 --> 00:53:03.920
So who was around at that time?

00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:08.060
Well, one person that got
the letter was Leibniz.

00:53:08.060 --> 00:53:12.800
He got it on the 9th of
June of that year, 1696.

00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:17.340
And he answered it,
sent an email back,

00:53:17.340 --> 00:53:20.000
by the 16th of
June with a letter

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:21.285
with a complete solution.

00:53:24.470 --> 00:53:29.640
It's a funny thing that actually
apparently Newton was very busy

00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:32.540
and didn't receive this letter.

00:53:32.540 --> 00:53:35.510
Or something happened,
and he got it one day,

00:53:35.510 --> 00:53:39.750
and he actually solved
the problem in one night.

00:53:39.750 --> 00:53:43.170
It took him one full
night to solve it.

00:53:43.170 --> 00:53:45.090
Now, you say, well,
how brilliant.

00:53:45.090 --> 00:53:49.670
And true, but given that
he had solved this problem,

00:53:49.670 --> 00:53:54.590
he was criticized as being
really slow and-- how come

00:53:54.590 --> 00:53:56.680
you took 12 hours to
solve this problem?

00:54:00.250 --> 00:54:02.210
So it's quite amazing.

00:54:02.210 --> 00:54:03.980
There's a lot of Bernoullis.

00:54:03.980 --> 00:54:08.970
And apparently, this
question by Jacob Bernoulli,

00:54:08.970 --> 00:54:11.990
the main purpose
of this question

00:54:11.990 --> 00:54:16.820
was to demonstrate to everybody
that his older brother,

00:54:16.820 --> 00:54:20.640
Jacob Bernoulli, who had
invented the Bernoulli numbers,

00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:22.790
was actually an
incompetent person that

00:54:22.790 --> 00:54:25.990
could not solve this problem.

00:54:25.990 --> 00:54:29.110
So that was apparently
what he wanted to do.

00:54:29.110 --> 00:54:31.650
It's a rather famous family.

00:54:31.650 --> 00:54:34.000
But they obviously
didn't get along.

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:37.330
But apparently, Jacob did
manage to solve the problem.

00:54:37.330 --> 00:54:41.515
So Jacob Bernoulli, Leibniz, and
Newton all solved the problem.

00:54:44.130 --> 00:54:47.670
Johann Bernoulli, the one that
started this problem-- and I

00:54:47.670 --> 00:54:50.220
think it's maybe
with a double N,

00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:54.510
I'm sorry-- his son
is Daniel Bernoulli.

00:54:54.510 --> 00:54:56.470
And engineers know
him, because that's

00:54:56.470 --> 00:55:01.160
the Bernoulli of the Bernoulli
fluid dynamics stuff.

00:55:01.160 --> 00:55:05.775
So the problem is
not all that easy.

00:55:05.775 --> 00:55:09.490
And calculus of variations
determines this shape.

00:55:09.490 --> 00:55:14.580
So the calculus of variation
applied to quantum mechanics

00:55:14.580 --> 00:55:21.000
asks, here, this function is
determined by the principle

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:24.250
that it minimizes time.

00:55:24.250 --> 00:55:26.730
So you have the
Schrodinger Equation.

00:55:26.730 --> 00:55:31.130
And you could ask, you have
all these Eigenfunctions.

00:55:31.130 --> 00:55:33.870
What do they minimize?

00:55:33.870 --> 00:55:36.610
Is there something
they're minimize?

00:55:36.610 --> 00:55:38.230
And the answer is yes.

00:55:38.230 --> 00:55:40.510
And this is what
you'll understand

00:55:40.510 --> 00:55:43.330
in the next few minutes.

00:55:43.330 --> 00:55:46.060
So what is the problem
we want to solve?

00:55:46.060 --> 00:55:52.280
We want to solve the
problem h psi equal e psi.

00:55:52.280 --> 00:55:54.670
So some Hamiltonian.

00:55:54.670 --> 00:56:00.390
Now my notation
will be such that it

00:56:00.390 --> 00:56:02.740
applies to three
dimensions as well.

00:56:02.740 --> 00:56:04.990
So I'll put just
arrows on top of it,

00:56:04.990 --> 00:56:07.850
and you would have to write
the proper Hamiltonian.

00:56:07.850 --> 00:56:11.690
It will not be necessary for
you to know the Hamiltonian.

00:56:11.690 --> 00:56:15.890
So I'll put psi
of x here, meaning

00:56:15.890 --> 00:56:21.360
that this is equally valid
for more than one dimension.

00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:28.200
Now we want to find
solutions of this equation.

00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:30.870
And you can say, what do
they maximize or minimize?

00:56:30.870 --> 00:56:33.600
Well we won't get to
it until 15 minutes.

00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:37.110
First let's try
something simpler.

00:56:37.110 --> 00:56:39.740
How about, can we
learn something

00:56:39.740 --> 00:56:43.950
about the ground state
energy of the system?

00:56:43.950 --> 00:56:48.360
So let's try to think about
the ground state energy.

00:56:50.950 --> 00:56:53.240
State energy.

00:57:00.670 --> 00:57:05.440
Now consider ground
state energy and we'll

00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:14.390
consider an
arbitrary-- arbitrary

00:57:14.390 --> 00:57:17.960
is the most
important word here--

00:57:17.960 --> 00:57:20.103
psi of x that is normalized.

00:57:23.070 --> 00:57:23.722
Is normalized.

00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:34.020
So integral the x of psi
squared is equal to 1.

00:57:39.480 --> 00:57:42.800
And here comes the claim.

00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:49.030
The first claim
that we can make.

00:57:49.030 --> 00:57:51.470
You see, this wave
function doesn't

00:57:51.470 --> 00:57:53.450
solve the Schrodinger equation.

00:57:53.450 --> 00:57:56.390
That's what we
mean by arbitrary.

00:57:56.390 --> 00:58:02.950
It's just any function of
space that is normalizable.

00:58:02.950 --> 00:58:04.980
Doesn't solve the
Schrodinger equation.

00:58:04.980 --> 00:58:07.110
Never the less,
you are commanded

00:58:07.110 --> 00:58:09.070
to compute the
following quantity.

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:22.090
This quantity is
also by definition

00:58:22.090 --> 00:58:24.480
what we call the
expectation value

00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:29.090
of the Hamiltonian
in the state psi.

00:58:29.090 --> 00:58:33.850
I love the fact, the
remarkable fact that we're

00:58:33.850 --> 00:58:38.000
going to show now, is
that this thing provides

00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:46.615
an upper bound for the ground
state energy for all psi.

00:58:50.230 --> 00:58:54.550
So let me try to make
sure we understand

00:58:54.550 --> 00:58:58.160
what's happening here.

00:58:58.160 --> 00:59:00.990
Here it says you don't know
the ground state energy

00:59:00.990 --> 00:59:03.880
but you're going to
learn something about it.

00:59:03.880 --> 00:59:06.880
Something that's
interesting is if you

00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:10.000
know that it has an upper bound,
so the ground state energy

00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:13.190
is definitely not
higher than this one,

00:59:13.190 --> 00:59:14.230
so you learn something.

00:59:14.230 --> 00:59:17.080
Would be ideal if you
had also lower bound

00:59:17.080 --> 00:59:19.500
so you knew it's in this range.

00:59:19.500 --> 00:59:24.040
But an upper bound is
a nice thing to have.

00:59:24.040 --> 00:59:28.250
And the claim here is that
each time you try an arbitrary

00:59:28.250 --> 00:59:32.090
function, you put anything
here, you ever write,

00:59:32.090 --> 00:59:34.840
you've got an upper bound.

00:59:34.840 --> 00:59:37.020
So how is this used?

00:59:37.020 --> 00:59:42.450
You try arbitrary functions
that you think look possibly

00:59:42.450 --> 00:59:45.560
like the wave function
of a bound state.

00:59:45.560 --> 00:59:47.730
And you get numbers
and you already

00:59:47.730 --> 00:59:49.880
know that the ground
state energy smaller

00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:52.470
than some number.

00:59:52.470 --> 00:59:57.240
So it's a rather nice way
of getting some information

00:59:57.240 --> 00:59:59.350
about the ground state energy.

00:59:59.350 --> 01:00:04.120
So this psi effects is
called a trial wave function.

01:00:06.870 --> 01:00:10.320
Is a trial wave function.

01:00:17.330 --> 01:00:22.040
So is the statement
of this theorem clear?

01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:24.250
Not the proof,
but the statement.

01:00:24.250 --> 01:00:25.260
Do we have questions?

01:00:30.955 --> 01:00:31.455
Yes.

01:00:34.125 --> 01:00:36.368
AUDIENCE: Is there any
statement about how

01:00:36.368 --> 01:00:38.808
using the wave
function will give us

01:00:38.808 --> 01:00:43.200
how accurate an
estimate [INAUDIBLE]

01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:44.870
PROFESSOR: No.

01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:47.655
We're going to become
good and figure out

01:00:47.655 --> 01:00:52.280
some nice way of choosing
wave functions, but no.

01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:55.380
Once you tried you
got some information.

01:00:55.380 --> 01:00:58.420
And you may not know
so easily whether you

01:00:58.420 --> 01:01:00.806
could go much lower.

01:01:00.806 --> 01:01:05.210
You can try a little, but
there's no clear way to know.

01:01:05.210 --> 01:01:10.170
This is just some
partial information.

01:01:10.170 --> 01:01:10.670
OK.

01:01:10.670 --> 01:01:14.270
So let me first prove this.

01:01:14.270 --> 01:01:21.180
We'll prove it and then explain
a little more what it all

01:01:21.180 --> 01:01:23.430
means.

01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:25.350
So the proof.

01:01:28.690 --> 01:01:32.480
Now it's a proof
under quotation marks.

01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:36.360
I will make a few assumptions.

01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:41.030
Basically, that I don't
have a continuous spectrum.

01:01:41.030 --> 01:01:45.740
Now that assumption is done for
me to write a simpler proof,

01:01:45.740 --> 01:01:47.780
not because the
result doesn't hold.

01:01:47.780 --> 01:01:51.830
So the proof is
good, but I will just

01:01:51.830 --> 01:01:55.750
consider for notational
purposes no continuous spectrum.

01:01:55.750 --> 01:01:58.190
So we'll have a
ground state energy

01:01:58.190 --> 01:02:03.610
which is e1 that is maybe less
than or equal to e2 less than

01:02:03.610 --> 01:02:07.550
or equal e3 like that.

01:02:07.550 --> 01:02:13.730
So you even may consider
the [? genorisies. ?]

01:02:13.730 --> 01:02:19.220
And we have h psi n
is equal to en psi n.

01:02:23.580 --> 01:02:26.890
So what do we have?

01:02:26.890 --> 01:02:29.130
We have a trial wave function.

01:02:29.130 --> 01:02:33.810
So your trial wave
function since it's

01:02:33.810 --> 01:02:36.780
an arbitrary
function of x should

01:02:36.780 --> 01:02:42.775
be expandable by completeness
as a serious or a superb

01:02:42.775 --> 01:02:46.670
position of the
energy eigenstates.

01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:52.210
Let me clarify this point.

01:02:52.210 --> 01:02:54.550
This is a trial wave function.

01:02:54.550 --> 01:02:57.910
Doesn't solve the
Schrodinger equation.

01:02:57.910 --> 01:03:04.180
So this Doesn't solve this
energy eigenstate equation.

01:03:04.180 --> 01:03:06.970
So in fact, it doesn't
solve it because this

01:03:06.970 --> 01:03:09.690
is a superb position
of many in here.

01:03:09.690 --> 01:03:13.110
So that's consistent
with this, and the fact

01:03:13.110 --> 01:03:17.970
that this wave function
as given in here

01:03:17.970 --> 01:03:22.200
just can be represented
using the energy eigenstates.

01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:25.050
But being a superb
position, it's

01:03:25.050 --> 01:03:28.490
not an energy eigenstate which
is true because a trial wave

01:03:28.490 --> 01:03:31.100
function is something that
you invent out of your head.

01:03:31.100 --> 01:03:32.670
It's not a solution.

01:03:32.670 --> 01:03:36.090
If you had a solution,
you wouldn't need this.

01:03:36.090 --> 01:03:37.550
So you don't have a solution.

01:03:37.550 --> 01:03:40.080
You invent the trial wave
function, and you have this.

01:03:44.130 --> 01:03:46.160
A couple of things.

01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:51.395
The psi squared
integral being one.

01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:58.960
You can do that
integral, that condition,

01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:05.410
is the sum of their
bn-2nd is equal to 1.

01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:12.880
This I use the orthonormality.

01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:15.190
You can elevate this.

01:04:15.190 --> 01:04:18.430
It's sort of the kinds of
things we're doing last time.

01:04:18.430 --> 01:04:21.910
Please make sure you
know how to do that.

01:04:21.910 --> 01:04:23.960
Then there's the
other computation

01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:28.020
that we also have
sketched last time, which

01:04:28.020 --> 01:04:32.535
is that the integral
of psi star h

01:04:32.535 --> 01:04:37.570
psi which is what
we want to compute,

01:04:37.570 --> 01:04:45.760
h hat psi is actually bn-2nd en.

01:04:51.170 --> 01:04:53.920
So that was
something we're doing

01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:56.650
towards the end of last lecture.

01:04:56.650 --> 01:05:00.920
And this computation takes a
few lines, but it was there.

01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:03.330
It's in the notes.

01:05:03.330 --> 01:05:09.860
And now comes the kind
of thing we want to say.

01:05:09.860 --> 01:05:11.170
Look at this sum.

01:05:11.170 --> 01:05:17.360
It has b1, e1, b2, e2,
b3, e3, but e2, e3, e4,

01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:23.130
all those are bigger,
or at most, equal to e1.

01:05:23.130 --> 01:05:27.440
So if I did, here,
the following bad joke

01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:35.140
of substituting en for e1, which
is not the same, if I put here

01:05:35.140 --> 01:05:39.450
bn squared n equals
1 to infinity.

01:05:39.450 --> 01:05:44.500
I put here e1,
well this is bigger

01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:47.480
than that because e2 is
possibly bigger than e1,

01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:49.450
e3 is bigger than e1.

01:05:49.450 --> 01:05:52.610
But it may be equal.

01:05:52.610 --> 01:05:55.940
But at this moment, e1
can go out of the sum.

01:05:55.940 --> 01:05:59.860
So this is e1 times
this sum which

01:05:59.860 --> 01:06:06.180
is 1 because bn is equal to 1.

01:06:06.180 --> 01:06:10.790
And e1 is the ground state
energy by definition.

01:06:10.790 --> 01:06:13.040
So the ground state
energy is less

01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:15.970
than this which
is the expectation

01:06:15.970 --> 01:06:17.760
value of the Hamiltonian.

01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:19.670
Pretty simple, in
fact, the proof

01:06:19.670 --> 01:06:22.700
is really a little too simple.

01:06:27.530 --> 01:06:30.790
Where do we go from now?

01:06:30.790 --> 01:06:36.540
Well let's make a
more general statement

01:06:36.540 --> 01:06:38.590
of the variational principal.

01:06:38.590 --> 01:06:42.230
Again, sometimes
it's not all that

01:06:42.230 --> 01:06:45.380
convenient to have
normalized wave functions.

01:06:45.380 --> 01:06:58.890
So recall that if psi
of x is not normalized,

01:06:58.890 --> 01:07:06.810
psi of x over the square root
of integral of psi-2nd dx is.

01:07:12.210 --> 01:07:18.510
Therefore if you
hand me an arbitrary

01:07:18.510 --> 01:07:20.950
psi of x that is
really arbitrary.

01:07:20.950 --> 01:07:24.250
You don't even bother
to normalize it.

01:07:24.250 --> 01:07:28.200
Then when I plug
here in this formula

01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:30.190
it is supposed to be normalized.

01:07:30.190 --> 01:07:33.530
So I plug the second
expression there.

01:07:33.530 --> 01:07:40.670
So therefore I get
that egs less than

01:07:40.670 --> 01:07:46.320
or equal to the
integral of psi star h

01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:54.650
psi the x over integral
of psi star psi the x.

01:08:03.890 --> 01:08:08.860
This is actually
nicer in one way

01:08:08.860 --> 01:08:12.770
because you don't have to work
with normalized wave functions.

01:08:12.770 --> 01:08:15.550
And that result
must be true still.

01:08:15.550 --> 01:08:16.430
Yes?

01:08:16.430 --> 01:08:17.305
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:08:21.063 --> 01:08:21.729
PROFESSOR: Sure.

01:08:21.729 --> 01:08:23.779
It cannot be
completely arbitrary,

01:08:23.779 --> 01:08:27.569
the function should
we normalizable.

01:08:27.569 --> 01:08:29.654
Doesn't have to be
normalized but normalizable.

01:08:32.470 --> 01:08:34.160
So here you got.

01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:36.890
And here let me introduce
just a little name.

01:08:39.630 --> 01:08:41.564
f of psi.

01:08:45.710 --> 01:08:49.586
f of psi is what is
called a functional.

01:08:52.810 --> 01:08:54.084
f of is a functional.

01:08:58.100 --> 01:09:00.240
What is a functional?

01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:03.899
A functional is a
machine or an expression

01:09:03.899 --> 01:09:10.750
whose input is a function
and whose output is a number.

01:09:10.750 --> 01:09:16.390
So here f of psi
is a functional.

01:09:16.390 --> 01:09:19.390
And maybe I should use brackets.

01:09:19.390 --> 01:09:23.529
Many times people with brackets
denote that, watch out,

01:09:23.529 --> 01:09:26.710
this is not a function,
it's a functional.

01:09:26.710 --> 01:09:29.680
And here it is.

01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:33.670
No dash there.

01:09:33.670 --> 01:09:38.250
You give me a psi of
x, which is a function,

01:09:38.250 --> 01:09:40.760
and then this is a
number because you've

01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:42.640
done the integrals.

01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:47.600
So that is like the
Brachistochrone problem, that

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:50.590
a funny name for it.

01:09:50.590 --> 01:09:51.359
Here it is.

01:09:51.359 --> 01:09:54.790
There is a function
now which is the time

01:09:54.790 --> 01:09:56.660
that it takes to go here.

01:09:56.660 --> 01:10:00.030
You give me a path,
a function, and I

01:10:00.030 --> 01:10:03.570
can calculate the time it will
take the mass to get here.

01:10:03.570 --> 01:10:08.460
So this was the issue of
finding a critical point

01:10:08.460 --> 01:10:09.840
of a functional.

01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:14.740
So actually we start to see,
it seems that the ground state

01:10:14.740 --> 01:10:17.835
energy is the minimum
of this functional.

01:10:22.300 --> 01:10:25.080
And what this
interesting as well

01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:31.150
is that when you get the
minimum you will have gotten

01:10:31.150 --> 01:10:33.270
a ground state wave function.

01:10:33.270 --> 01:10:36.580
So the ground state
wave function actually

01:10:36.580 --> 01:10:40.830
is the thing that
minimizes this functional

01:10:40.830 --> 01:10:45.250
and gives you some value,
the ground state energy.

01:10:45.250 --> 01:10:50.080
A little more in a
couple of minutes.

01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:52.990
Let's do an example.

01:10:52.990 --> 01:11:08.350
How do we use this so now if
you think about this carefully

01:11:08.350 --> 01:11:14.220
it's kind of dizzying because
what is sell functional,

01:11:14.220 --> 01:11:15.670
really?

01:11:15.670 --> 01:11:19.720
It's, in some sense, a function
in an infinite dimensional

01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:24.770
space because a function
itself is specified

01:11:24.770 --> 01:11:27.670
by infinitely many numbers
that you can change.

01:11:27.670 --> 01:11:33.750
So how many dimensions
you have is how many ways

01:11:33.750 --> 01:11:38.660
you can move your hands, but
they are linearly independent.

01:11:38.660 --> 01:11:41.250
But if you have a function,
and you can change it,

01:11:41.250 --> 01:11:43.490
you can change it here,
you can change it there,

01:11:43.490 --> 01:11:45.760
or you can change it
there, and those are all

01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:48.170
orthogonal directions.

01:11:48.170 --> 01:11:50.180
You're finding a critical point.

01:11:50.180 --> 01:11:52.190
When you find the
critical point,

01:11:52.190 --> 01:11:56.070
you should imagine that you're
plotting a function that is not

01:11:56.070 --> 01:12:00.040
one dimensional function or
two dimensional function,

01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:02.740
but it's infinitely
dimensional function.

01:12:02.740 --> 01:12:09.060
Direction one, direction two,
infinitely many directions.

01:12:09.060 --> 01:12:12.010
And suddenly in this
infinitely many directions

01:12:12.010 --> 01:12:14.770
you find the critical point.

01:12:14.770 --> 01:12:19.720
It's really incredible that
one can do these things.

01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:21.620
So you're at that
critical point,

01:12:21.620 --> 01:12:25.250
and you can deform
the energy eigenstate

01:12:25.250 --> 01:12:28.230
by making it a little
fatter here or thinner

01:12:28.230 --> 01:12:29.460
here or up there.

01:12:29.460 --> 01:12:31.120
And those are the
infinite directions

01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:33.550
in any direction that
you will the energy

01:12:33.550 --> 01:12:37.837
goes up because you're
at the global minimum

01:12:37.837 --> 01:12:38.670
it's pretty amazing.

01:12:41.540 --> 01:12:45.850
Something that you will
prove in the homework

01:12:45.850 --> 01:12:50.550
is that actually it's even more.

01:12:50.550 --> 01:12:58.560
Every single eigenstate
is a critical point

01:12:58.560 --> 01:12:59.580
of this functional.

01:12:59.580 --> 01:13:02.050
So you've got the
lowest energy state

01:13:02.050 --> 01:13:05.850
and in that infinite dimensional
space in every direction

01:13:05.850 --> 01:13:08.700
that you move you go up.

01:13:08.700 --> 01:13:12.960
The first excited state
is another critical point.

01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:17.750
But it will not be
an absolute minimum.

01:13:17.750 --> 01:13:20.530
It will be a [? saddle ?]
an infinite dimensional

01:13:20.530 --> 01:13:22.560
[? saddle ?] which
are infinitely

01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:25.010
many directions in
which you go up.

01:13:25.010 --> 01:13:27.560
There's one direction
in which you go down

01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:31.600
because you could flow
towards the ground state.

01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:35.820
So the first excited state
is the [? saddle ?] but these

01:13:35.820 --> 01:13:38.640
are all stationary points
of this functional.

01:13:41.340 --> 01:13:44.356
So we'll conclude by
doing this example.

01:13:51.650 --> 01:13:52.971
Sorry, what is the question?

01:13:52.971 --> 01:13:53.846
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:13:56.650 --> 01:13:59.380
PROFESSOR: I didn't assume
it's non-degenerate.

01:13:59.380 --> 01:14:02.960
So if you have two things that
have the same ground state,

01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:07.630
the functional will have, in
fact, the degeneracy there

01:14:07.630 --> 01:14:13.040
will be two solutions
that have the same energy.

01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:17.640
And any linear combination of
them will have the same energy.

01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:21.080
The proof that I did here
doesn't assume non-degeneracy,

01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:25.080
it's even true with
degenerate things.

01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:30.910
So the example is an
example for illustration,

01:14:30.910 --> 01:14:35.880
not for solving something
that you can't do otherwise.

01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:38.240
So it's a delta
function potential.

01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:44.580
v of x is minus alpha delta
of x with alpha positive.

01:14:44.580 --> 01:14:47.740
And the ground state
energy is well known.

01:14:47.740 --> 01:14:52.450
It's minus m alpha
squared over 2h-2nd.

01:14:52.450 --> 01:14:57.520
You've solved this
problem many times in 804.

01:14:57.520 --> 01:14:59.390
So trial wave function.

01:14:59.390 --> 01:15:01.130
Well you know how
it should look,

01:15:01.130 --> 01:15:03.550
but let's assume you don't.

01:15:03.550 --> 01:15:07.010
And you say, it's some
sort of [INAUDIBLE].

01:15:07.010 --> 01:15:09.610
So trial.

01:15:09.610 --> 01:15:15.630
It would be psi of x equals
e to the minus x squared.

01:15:15.630 --> 01:15:20.930
While this would do,
you're going to work hard

01:15:20.930 --> 01:15:23.330
and you're not going to
reap all the benefits

01:15:23.330 --> 01:15:25.310
of this calculation.

01:15:25.310 --> 01:15:29.320
So what you should do at this
moment is put a constant here.

01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:35.190
Minus beta squared x squared
and I'll put the minus one half.

01:15:35.190 --> 01:15:36.815
This is our trial wave function.

01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:45.330
You see, by this, you're
going to get an expression.

01:15:45.330 --> 01:15:47.460
You calculate this
number, and you're

01:15:47.460 --> 01:15:49.410
going to get the
function of beta.

01:15:49.410 --> 01:15:50.800
Beta is not going to disappear.

01:15:53.460 --> 01:15:56.040
And therefore, you're going
to know that the ground state

01:15:56.040 --> 01:15:59.360
energy is less than
this function of beta.

01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:04.120
And then you can adjust
beta to get the best bound.

01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:07.020
So beta is put as a
parameter to begin with,

01:16:07.020 --> 01:16:09.260
and we hope to use it.

01:16:09.260 --> 01:16:19.400
So note that integral of
psi squared dx in this case

01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:23.960
is equal to square
root of pi over beta.

01:16:23.960 --> 01:16:29.320
So we have to calculate
this whole functional.

01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:33.656
So this integral
of psi star-- well

01:16:33.656 --> 01:16:36.420
I don't have to bother with
psi star because it's real.

01:16:36.420 --> 01:16:42.920
h psi over psi psi,
and what do we get?

01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:45.070
Well the denominator is easy.

01:16:45.070 --> 01:16:48.840
So we beta over
square root of pi,

01:16:48.840 --> 01:16:51.005
and let me write the
whole thing here.

01:16:51.005 --> 01:16:54.970
dx the psi would have
e to the minus one half

01:16:54.970 --> 01:16:58.750
beta squared x squared
minus h squared

01:16:58.750 --> 01:17:07.100
over 2m d-2nd dx2nd
minus alpha delta of x.

01:17:07.100 --> 01:17:09.910
And another wave function,
e to the minus one

01:17:09.910 --> 01:17:13.980
half beta squared x-2nd.

01:17:13.980 --> 01:17:14.650
OK.

01:17:14.650 --> 01:17:16.390
So you have to evaluate that.

01:17:16.390 --> 01:17:20.096
And that's the part
that is not so much fun.

01:17:20.096 --> 01:17:23.760
For any integral
that you have in 805,

01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:29.340
we believe that you can use
Mathematica or Maple or MATLAB

01:17:29.340 --> 01:17:31.220
or whatever and do it.

01:17:31.220 --> 01:17:34.550
The only reason not to
use any of these things

01:17:34.550 --> 01:17:37.240
is if you think you could
not do the integral.

01:17:37.240 --> 01:17:39.490
But once you realize,
oh, this is an integral,

01:17:39.490 --> 01:17:42.720
I know how to do,
don't waste time.

01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:44.340
Use any of those programs.

01:17:44.340 --> 01:17:48.400
Now, this part of the
integral is kind of easy

01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:51.610
because the delta function
just picks the value of 0.

01:17:51.610 --> 01:17:56.020
So this part of the
integral gives you

01:17:56.020 --> 01:18:00.780
minus beta alpha over
square root of pi.

01:18:00.780 --> 01:18:03.530
The other part of the
integral, however,

01:18:03.530 --> 01:18:06.120
is a little more complicated.

01:18:06.120 --> 01:18:10.240
Believe it or not, it
makes a big difference

01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:12.110
whether you take
the two derivatives

01:18:12.110 --> 01:18:14.710
of this function or
you integrate by parts.

01:18:14.710 --> 01:18:18.500
If you integrate by parts,
you save a lot of work.

01:18:18.500 --> 01:18:20.910
So let me integrate by parts.

01:18:20.910 --> 01:18:26.120
This becomes, plus beta
over square root of h,

01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:32.320
h-2nd over 2m,
integral dx of ddx of e

01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:38.590
to the minus one half beta
squared x-2nd squared.

01:18:38.590 --> 01:18:41.850
So you integrate by
parts one of the ddx

01:18:41.850 --> 01:18:46.020
and then you have the other
ddx, so it's the thing squared.

01:18:46.020 --> 01:18:51.250
And that's an easier
integral to do.

01:18:51.250 --> 01:18:53.850
We don't want to
bother with this,

01:18:53.850 --> 01:18:58.280
but this whole
thing then becomes

01:18:58.280 --> 01:19:04.750
minus beta over square root of
pi, alpha plus beta squared h

01:19:04.750 --> 01:19:06.450
squared over 4m.

01:19:06.450 --> 01:19:11.740
That's the whole
answer And that's

01:19:11.740 --> 01:19:16.330
the valuation of
this whole thing.

01:19:16.330 --> 01:19:18.490
So look what you get.

01:19:18.490 --> 01:19:21.770
You got a function
of beta indeed.

01:19:21.770 --> 01:19:24.800
So how does that
function of beta look?

01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:29.850
It's 0 for beta equals 0 is 0
for some other possible beta,

01:19:29.850 --> 01:19:31.860
it's going to look like this.

01:19:31.860 --> 01:19:34.320
So there's a point at
which this function is

01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:37.800
going to have a minimum, and
we should choose that point

01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:41.545
to get the best upper
bound on the function.

01:19:45.270 --> 01:19:53.040
Our claim is that following
from the variational theorem

01:19:53.040 --> 01:19:55.690
that we've proven
is that the e ground

01:19:55.690 --> 01:20:03.220
state is less than or equal
than the minimum value over beta

01:20:03.220 --> 01:20:09.050
of this beta squared
h squared over 4m

01:20:09.050 --> 01:20:12.875
minus beta square
root of pie alpha.

01:20:12.875 --> 01:20:17.150
So you minimize over beta,
and yet still the ground state

01:20:17.150 --> 01:20:21.440
energy must be a little
smaller than that.

01:20:21.440 --> 01:20:22.860
Well what do you get?

01:20:25.790 --> 01:20:29.910
You do this, this minimization
gives beta equal 2m

01:20:29.910 --> 01:20:34.660
alpha over h squared
square root of pi.

01:20:34.660 --> 01:20:37.190
It's a little messy
but not terrible.

01:20:37.190 --> 01:20:41.230
And you substitute, and you
get that e ground state is

01:20:41.230 --> 01:20:49.140
less than or equal than m alpha
squared over pi h squared.

01:20:49.140 --> 01:20:56.400
And to better write it as 2
over pi times minus m alpha

01:20:56.400 --> 01:21:02.300
squared over 2h-2nd which is
the true ground state energy.

01:21:02.300 --> 01:21:06.660
So let's just make sure we
understand what has happened.

01:21:06.660 --> 01:21:08.640
Here is the energy.

01:21:08.640 --> 01:21:10.880
Here is zero.

01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:15.360
Energy as just a vertical
plot here is zero.

01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:20.350
The true ground state
energy of this problem

01:21:20.350 --> 01:21:25.280
is this one, let's call
it egs, is negative.

01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:27.970
And we go 2 over pi times that.

01:21:27.970 --> 01:21:33.200
2 over pi is about 0.64.

01:21:33.200 --> 01:21:40.560
So the bound says
that here is 0.64 egs.

01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:44.650
So that's what the
bound told you.

01:21:44.650 --> 01:21:49.180
The bound state energy must
be lower than this quantity.

01:21:49.180 --> 01:21:50.490
We got close.

01:21:50.490 --> 01:21:53.590
Not impressively
close, but the work

01:21:53.590 --> 01:21:55.850
functional was not
all that bad either.

01:21:58.800 --> 01:21:59.966
Question?

01:21:59.966 --> 01:22:01.830
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
always going

01:22:01.830 --> 01:22:04.160
to be a constant times
incorrect energy value

01:22:04.160 --> 01:22:06.750
or is it just the
closest approximation?

01:22:06.750 --> 01:22:08.360
PROFESSOR: Is it
going to be what?

01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:10.176
AUDIENCE: Is it
always going to be

01:22:10.176 --> 01:22:12.936
a constant times the correct
energy value or is it just--

01:22:12.936 --> 01:22:14.890
PROFESSOR: Well it
typically is like that

01:22:14.890 --> 01:22:19.000
because of dimensional units.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.900
You're looking for a
constant because you're not

01:22:21.900 --> 01:22:23.150
looking for the function.

01:22:23.150 --> 01:22:28.590
So you will get a number times
a correct value, yes, indeed.

01:22:28.590 --> 01:22:33.646
That's an illustration of the
problem of wave functions.

01:22:33.646 --> 01:22:36.310
You know the variational
principle tells you

01:22:36.310 --> 01:22:38.310
things about the
ground state but allows

01:22:38.310 --> 01:22:41.620
you to find the first
excited state as well

01:22:41.620 --> 01:22:45.570
if the potential is symmetric,
will allow you to prove

01:22:45.570 --> 01:22:49.060
that any attractive
potential has a bound state.

01:22:49.060 --> 01:22:51.750
And you will prove
in the homework

01:22:51.750 --> 01:22:56.040
that stationary points of these
things are the eigenfunctions.

01:22:56.040 --> 01:22:58.210
See you next Monday.
