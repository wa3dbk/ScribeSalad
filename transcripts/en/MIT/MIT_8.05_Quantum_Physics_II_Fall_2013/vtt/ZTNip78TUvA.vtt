00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.770
PROFESSOR: Today we
have plenty to do.

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:29.780
We really begin
in all generality

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.580
the addition of
angular momentum.

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:37.970
But we will do it in the set
up of a physical problem.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.020
The problem of
computing the spin

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:46.960
orbit interactions of
electrons with the nucleus.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.940
So this is a rather interesting
and complicated interaction.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.610
So we'll spend a
little time telling you

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.520
about the physics
of this interaction.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.230
And then once the
physics is clear,

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.720
it will become
more obvious why we

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.980
have to do these mathematical
contortions of adding angular

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.960
momentum in order to solve
this physical problem.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.790
So it's a sophisticated problem
that requires several steps.

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.420
The first step is
something that is

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.480
a result in perturbation theory.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.460
Feynman Hellman Theorem
of perturbation theory.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.270
And that's where we begin.

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.770
So it's called Feynman
Hellman Theorem.

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:41.900
It's a very simple result.

00:01:46.605 --> 00:01:47.105
Theorem.

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.530
And we'll need it in
order to understand

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.990
how a small perturbation
to the Hamiltonian

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.240
changes the energy spectrum.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:12.110
So we have H of lambda be a
Hamiltonian with a parameter

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.252
in lambda.

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.540
Lambda.

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:30.640
And psi n of lambda
being normalized energy

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:40.550
eigenstate with
energy, En of lambda.

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.890
So that's the whole
assumption of the theorem.

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.130
We have a Hamiltonian.

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.080
It depends on some parameter
that we're going to vary.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:01.530
And suppose we consider now an
eigenstate of this Hamiltonian

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.140
that depends on lambda,
so the eigenstate also

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.050
depends on lambda.

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.770
And it has an
energy, En of lambda.

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:11.860
So the purpose of
this theorem is

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.130
to relate these
various quantities.

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:22.530
And the claim is that
the rate of change

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.810
of the energy with
respect to lambda

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:34.900
can be computed pretty much by
evaluating the rate of change

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.140
of the Hamiltonian on
the relevant states.

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:51.660
So that's the claim.

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.740
And it's a pretty nice result.

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:08.940
It's useful in
many circumstances.

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.630
And for us will be a way to
discuss a little perturbation

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:14.470
theory.

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:19.240
Perturbation theory is the
subject of 806 in all details.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.970
And it's a very
sophisticated subject.

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.970
Even today we were going
to be finding that it's not

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.140
all that easy to carry it out.

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.100
So how does this begin?

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.890
Well, proof.

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.410
You begin by saying
that En of lambda

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:42.860
is the energy eigenstate,
is nothing else

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:47.200
but psi n of lambda.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.950
H of lambda.

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.810
Psi n of lambda.

00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:01.860
And the reason is, of
course, that H and psi n

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:07.400
is En of lambda times
psi n of lambda.

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.385
And this is a number goes out.

00:05:09.385 --> 00:05:12.400
And the inner product
of this things

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.140
is 1, because the
state is normalized.

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:18.980
So this is a good
starting point.

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:24.780
And the funny thing that you see
already is that, in some sense,

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:27.840
you just get the
middle term when

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.290
you take the derivative
with respect to lambda.

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:32.320
You don't get anything
from these two.

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:36.540
And it's simple in fact.

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:38.310
So let me just do it.

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:43.880
V, En, V lambda
would be the term

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:49.140
that Feynman and Hellman gave.

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:55.400
V, H, V lambda, psi n of lambda.

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.470
Plus one term in which we
differentiate this one.

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:05.500
V, d lambda of the
state psi n of lambda.

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:17.130
Times H of lambda,
psi n of lambda.

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:21.380
Plus the other term in which
you differentiate the ket.

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:32.610
So psi n of lambda, H of lambda,
d, d lambda of psi n of lambda.

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:46.710
And the reason these
terms are going to vanish

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:53.020
is that you can now act
with H again on psi n.

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:57.620
H is supposed to be Hermitian,
so it can act on the left.

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:07.220
And therefore, these two
terms give you En of lambda,

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:19.400
times d d lambda of psi n of
lambda-- psi n of lambda--

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:23.750
plus the other term, which
would be psi n of lambda,

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:27.395
the bra times the
derivative of the ket.

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:43.550
But this is nothing
else than the derivative

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:44.730
of the inner product.

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:57.250
In the inner product
to differentiate--

00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:00.020
the inner product
differentiates the bra,

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:01.920
it differentiates the ket.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:04.280
And do it.

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:08.220
And this thing is equal to
1, because it's normalized.

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:10.890
So this is 0.

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:12.650
End of proof.

00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:16.320
These two terms vanish.

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:20.860
And the result holds.

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:21.652
Yes?

00:08:21.652 --> 00:08:23.527
AUDIENCE: How do you
know it stays normalized

00:08:23.527 --> 00:08:24.505
when you vary lambda?

00:08:24.505 --> 00:08:28.440
PROFESSOR: It's an assumption.

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:31.770
The state is normalized
for all values of n.

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:34.925
So if you have a state
that you've constructed,

00:08:34.925 --> 00:08:39.669
that is normalized, you
can have this result.

00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:41.030
So it's an assumption.

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:42.845
You have to keep the
state normalized.

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:50.900
Now this is a baby version
of perturbation theory.

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:55.320
It's a result I think that
Feynman did as an undergrad.

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:59.290
And as you can see,
it's very simple.

00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:03.290
Calling it a theorem
is a little too much.

00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:06.540
But still, the fact
is that it's useful.

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:10.670
And so we'll just
go ahead and use it.

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:14.910
Now I want to rewrite
it in another way.

00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:19.250
So, suppose you have
a Hamiltonian, H,

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:24.755
which has a term
H0, plus lambda, H1.

00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:41.770
So, the parameter lambda, H of
lambda, is given in this way.

00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:45.180
And that's a
reasonable H of lambda.

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:49.860
Sometimes, this could be
written as H0 plus something

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:52.670
that we will call the
change in the Hamiltonian.

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:57.540
And we usually think
of it as a small thing.

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:05.190
So what do we have
from this theorem?

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:18.020
From this here we would
have the d, En, d lambda

00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:29.380
is equal to psi n of
lambda, H1, psi n of lambda.

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:37.400
Now, we can be
particularly interested

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:41.250
in the evaluation of this
thing at lambda equals 0.

00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:44.830
So what is d En of lambda?

00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:55.330
d lambda at lambda equals
0 would be psi n at zero,

00:10:55.330 --> 00:11:00.970
H1, psi n at 0.

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:07.870
And therefore, you would say
that the En of lambda energies

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:19.790
would be the energies
at 0, plus lambda, d En

00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:25.510
of lambda, d lambda
at lambda equals 0,

00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:28.093
plus order lambda squared.

00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:38.740
I'm doing just the
Taylor expansion

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:46.450
of En's of lambda
from lambda equals 0.

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:56.480
So this thing tells you that
En of lambda is equal En of 0,

00:11:56.480 --> 00:12:08.302
plus-- this derivative you can
write it as psi n, lambda, H1,

00:12:08.302 --> 00:12:13.008
psi n, all at 0.

00:12:13.008 --> 00:12:13.980
Like that.

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:16.955
Plus order lambda squared.

00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:28.600
So in this step, I just use the
evaluation that we did here.

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:32.380
I substituted that
and put the lambda in.

00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:45.470
So that I recognize now that En
of lambda is equal to En of 0,

00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:53.990
plus psi n of 0-- and I can
write this as delta H-- psi

00:12:53.990 --> 00:13:00.803
n of 0, plus order
delta H squared.

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:12.780
It's nice to write it this
way, because you appreciate

00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:15.540
more the power of the theorem.

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:20.640
The theorem here doesn't assume
which value of lambda you have.

00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:23.070
And you have to have
normalized eigenstates.

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:26.320
And you wonder what is
it helping you with,

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:30.820
if finding the states for every
value of lambda is complicated.

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:37.160
Well, it certainly
helps you to figure out

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:42.960
how the energy of the state
varies by a simple calculation.

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:46.725
Suppose you know the states
of the simple Hamiltonian.

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:55.630
Those are the psi's, n, 0.

00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:59.870
So if you have the
psi n 0 over here,

00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:03.120
you can do the following step.

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:07.930
If you want to figure out
how it's energy has varied,

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:14.260
use this formula in which
you compute the expectation

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:20.370
value of the change in the
Hamiltonian on that state.

00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:26.310
And that is the first correction
to the energy of the state.

00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:29.010
So you have this state.

00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:31.710
You compute the
expectation value

00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:34.880
of the extra piece
in the Hamiltonian.

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:39.270
And that's the
correction to the energy.

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:41.300
It's a little more
complicated of course

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:43.600
to compute the
correction to the state.

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:47.570
But that's a subject
of perturbation theory.

00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:51.790
And that's not what we
care about right now.

00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:57.410
So the reason we're doing this
is because actually whatever

00:14:57.410 --> 00:15:01.010
we're going to have
with spin orbit coupling

00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:04.100
represents an addition
to the hydrogen

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:06.680
Hamiltonian of a new term.

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:10.060
Therefore, you want to know what
happens to the energy levels.

00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:11.970
And the best thing
to think about them

00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:15.360
is to-- if you know the
energy levels of this one,

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:17.980
well, a formula of
this type can let

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:20.082
you know what happens
to the energy levels

00:15:20.082 --> 00:15:21.040
after the perturbation.

00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:25.790
There will be an
extra complication

00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:28.500
in that the energy levels
that we're going to deal with

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:29.930
are going to be degenerate.

00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:32.980
But let's wait for that
complication until it appears.

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:34.650
So any questions?

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:38.870
Yes?

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:40.820
AUDIENCE: So I would
imagine that this

00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:42.704
would work just
as well for time.

00:15:42.704 --> 00:15:45.974
Because time [INAUDIBLE] a
parameter in quantum mechanics.

00:15:45.974 --> 00:15:48.404
So [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:48.404 --> 00:15:50.830
PROFESSOR: Time dependent
perturbation theory

00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:52.930
is a bit more complicated.

00:15:52.930 --> 00:15:56.860
I'd rather not get into it now.

00:15:56.860 --> 00:16:01.450
So let's leave it here, in
which we don't have time.

00:16:01.450 --> 00:16:03.280
And the Schrodinger
equation is something

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:07.617
like H psi equal [INAUDIBLE]
psi, that's all we care.

00:16:07.617 --> 00:16:11.250
And leave it for that moment.

00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:11.933
Other questions?

00:16:21.496 --> 00:16:22.460
OK.

00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:28.530
So let's proceed with
addition of angular momentum.

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:34.160
So first, let me give you
the fundamental result

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.010
of addition of angular momentum.

00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:39.880
It's a little abstract,
but it's what we really

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:41.725
mean by addition of
angular momentum.

00:16:45.197 --> 00:16:48.763
Of angular momentum.

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:53.960
And the main result
is the following.

00:16:53.960 --> 00:17:00.450
Suppose you have a set
of operators, J, i,

00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:04.929
1, that have the algebra
of angular momentum.

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:11.250
Of angular momentum.

00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:21.609
Which is to say
Ji1, JJ1, is equal

00:17:21.609 --> 00:17:25.712
i, h bar, epsilon iJK, JK1.

00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:34.180
And this algebra is realized
on some state space.

00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:41.330
On some vector space, V1.

00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:44.760
And suppose you have
another operator,

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:48.180
J-- set of operators actually.

00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:51.395
Ji2, which have the algebra
of angular momentum.

00:17:51.395 --> 00:17:53.470
I will not write that.

00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:56.280
On some V2.

00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:00.640
OK.

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:03.340
Angular momentum,
some sets of states.

00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:07.570
Angular momentum on some
other set of states.

00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:10.090
Here comes the thing.

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:13.620
There is a new angular
momentum, which

00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:24.970
is the sum Ji defined
as Ji1, added with Ji2.

00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:30.560
Now, soon enough you will
just write Ji1, plus Ji2.

00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:34.590
But let me be a little
more careful now.

00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:45.290
This sum is Ji1,
plus 1, tensor Ji2.

00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:48.080
So i is the same index.

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:53.230
But here, we're
having this operator

00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:57.140
that we're being defined
that we call it the sum.

00:18:57.140 --> 00:19:01.730
Now how do you sum two operators
that act in different spaces?

00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:04.680
Well, the only thing
that you can actually do

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:07.120
is sum them in the
tensor product.

00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:19.136
So the claim is that this is an
angular momentum in V1 tensor

00:19:19.136 --> 00:19:19.635
V2.

00:19:25.810 --> 00:19:28.190
That is an operator.

00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:29.690
You see, you have to sum them.

00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:34.490
So you have to create a
space where both can act,

00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:36.180
and you can sum them.

00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:40.320
You cannot sum a thing, an
operator that acts on one

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:43.420
vector space to an operator that
acts on another vector space.

00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:47.850
You have to create one
vector space where both act.

00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:51.250
And then you can define
the sum of the operators.

00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:53.750
Sum of operators
is a simple thing.

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:56.460
So you form the tensor product.

00:19:56.460 --> 00:20:00.680
In here, this
operator gets upgraded

00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:05.390
in this way, in which in the
tensor product it has a 1

00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:06.970
for the second input.

00:20:06.970 --> 00:20:09.290
This one gets
upgrade to this way.

00:20:09.290 --> 00:20:10.250
And this is the sum.

00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:17.270
So this is a claim--
this is a definition.

00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:18.640
And this is a claim.

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:21.430
So this has to be proven.

00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:23.370
So let me prove it.

00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:28.910
Ji, JJ.

00:20:28.910 --> 00:20:30.730
I compute this commutator.

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:32.930
So I don't have to
do the following.

00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:45.530
I have to do Ji1, tensor
1, plus 1 tensor Ji2.

00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:56.620
And then the JJ would be JJ1,
tensor 1, plus 1, tensor JJ2.

00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:03.320
Have to compute this commutator.

00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:06.880
Now, an important
fact about this

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:09.320
result that I'm not
trying to generalize,

00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:12.700
if you had put a minus
here, it wouldn't work out.

00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:15.480
If you would have put a 2
here, it wouldn't work out.

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:19.130
If you would have put a 1/2
here, it won't work out.

00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:22.060
This is pretty much
the only way you

00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:26.370
can have two angular momenta,
and create a third angular

00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:27.620
momentum.

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:29.240
So look at this.

00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:34.820
It looks like we're going
to have to work hard,

00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:38.490
but that's not true.

00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:40.650
Consider this commutator.

00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:42.970
The commutator of this
term with this term.

00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:47.430
That's 0 actually.

00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:51.950
Because if you multiply them
in this order, this times that,

00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:57.080
you get Ji1 times Ji2,
because the ones do nothing.

00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:59.710
You multiply them in
the reverse order,

00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:03.860
you get again, Ji1 times Ji2.

00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:08.895
This is to say that the
operators that originally lived

00:22:08.895 --> 00:22:13.510
in the different
vector spaces commute.

00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:15.260
Yes?

00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:19.320
AUDIENCE: Since the cross
terms between those two

00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:22.900
are 0-- like you just said,
the cross terms are 0.

00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:27.600
And if you put a minus sign
in there, it will cancel.

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:29.494
But when you do
the multiplications

00:22:29.494 --> 00:22:33.318
with the second ones, why can't
you put a minus sign in there?

00:22:33.318 --> 00:22:34.170
[INAUDIBLE]

00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:35.420
PROFESSOR: In the whole thing?

00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:37.790
In this definition,
a minus sign?

00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:38.720
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:41.900
PROFESSOR: Well, here
if I put a minus--

00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:45.270
it's like I'm going to
prove that this works.

00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:48.860
So if-- I'm going to
get an angular momentum.

00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:51.750
If I put a minus sign
to angular momentum,

00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:54.420
I ruin the algebra here.

00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:56.810
I put a minus minus, it cancels.

00:22:56.810 --> 00:23:00.010
But then I get a
minus sign here.

00:23:00.010 --> 00:23:03.940
So I cannot really
even change a sign.

00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:09.690
So any way, these are operators
acting on different spaces.

00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:11.320
They commute.

00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:13.375
It's clear they commute.

00:23:13.375 --> 00:23:15.700
You just multiply
them, and see that.

00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:18.860
These one's commute as well.

00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:23.730
The only ones that don't
commute are this with this.

00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:25.310
And that with that.

00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:27.520
So let me just write them.

00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:38.430
Ji1, tensor 1,
with JJ1, tensor 1.

00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:50.347
Plus this one, 1 tensor
Ji2, 1 tensor JJ2.

00:23:58.730 --> 00:24:01.870
OK, next step is to
realize that actually

00:24:01.870 --> 00:24:07.280
the 1 is a spectator here.

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:10.180
Therefore, this
commutator is nothing

00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:19.130
but the commutator Ji1
with JJ1, tensor 1.

00:24:23.370 --> 00:24:24.510
You can do it.

00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:27.530
If you prefer to
write it, write it.

00:24:27.530 --> 00:24:32.930
This product is Ji
times JJ, tensor 1.

00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:37.240
And the other product
is JJ, Ji, tensor 1.

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:41.040
So the tensor 1 factors out.

00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:44.980
Here the tensor 1
also factors out.

00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:50.470
And you get an honest
commutator, Ji2, JJ2.

00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:57.290
So one last step.

00:24:57.290 --> 00:25:01.920
This is i, h bar, epsilon, iJK.

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:04.750
I'll put a big parentheses.

00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:12.990
JK1, tensor 1,
for the first one.

00:25:12.990 --> 00:25:17.530
Because J1 forms an
angular momentum algebra.

00:25:17.530 --> 00:25:21.750
And here, 1 tensor JK2.

00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:36.280
And this thing is i,
h bar, epsilon, iJK.

00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:41.880
The total angular
momentum, K. And you've

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:43.990
shown the algebra works out.

00:25:48.370 --> 00:25:52.620
Now most people after
a little practice,

00:25:52.620 --> 00:26:02.890
they just say, oh, Ji is
J1 plus J2, J1 plus J2.

00:26:02.890 --> 00:26:04.910
J1 and J2 don't commute.

00:26:04.910 --> 00:26:07.870
J2 and J1-- I'm sorry.

00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:09.390
J1 and J2 commute.

00:26:09.390 --> 00:26:11.110
J2 and J1 commute.

00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:14.470
Therefore you get
this 2, like that.

00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:18.760
And this gives you--
J1 and J1 gives you J1.

00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:22.230
J2 and J2 gives you J2,
so the sum works out.

00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:25.530
So most people after
a little practice

00:26:25.530 --> 00:26:28.100
just don't put all
these tensor things.

00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:32.320
But at the beginning it's
nice to just make sure

00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:36.700
that you understand what
these tensor things do.

00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:37.280
All right.

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:40.700
So that's our main
theorem-- that you

00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:45.180
start with one angular
momentum on a state space.

00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:49.090
Another angular momentum that
has nothing to do perhaps

00:26:49.090 --> 00:26:53.170
with the first on
another vector space.

00:26:53.170 --> 00:26:58.390
And on the tensor product you
have another angular momentum,

00:26:58.390 --> 00:26:59.420
which is the sum.

00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:02.670
All right.

00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:05.590
So now, we do spin
orbit coupling

00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:08.660
to try to apply these ideas.

00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:25.060
So for spin orbit coupling, we
will consider the hydrogen atom

00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:28.000
coupling.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:36.610
And the new term in the
Hamiltonian, mu dot B.

00:27:36.610 --> 00:27:41.390
The kind of term that we've
done so much in this semester.

00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:43.880
We've looked over magnetic ones.

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:46.700
So which magnetic
moment at which B?

00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:50.050
There was no B in
the hydrogen atom.

00:27:50.050 --> 00:27:54.850
Well, there's no
B to begin with.

00:27:54.850 --> 00:27:58.980
But here is one where you can
think there is a B. First,

00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:06.280
this will be the
electron dipole moment.

00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:07.790
Magnetic dipole moment.

00:28:07.790 --> 00:28:11.350
So we have a formula for it.

00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:17.370
The formula for it is the mu of
the electron is minus E over m,

00:28:17.370 --> 00:28:19.960
times the spin of the electron.

00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:25.090
And I actually will use a
little different formula

00:28:25.090 --> 00:28:28.130
that is valued in
Gaussian units.

00:28:28.130 --> 00:28:35.550
ge over mC, S, in
Gaussian units.

00:28:38.590 --> 00:28:42.070
And g is the g factor of
the electron, which is 2.

00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:42.770
I'm sorry.

00:28:42.770 --> 00:28:44.850
There's a 2 here.

00:28:44.850 --> 00:28:45.440
OK.

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:46.990
So look what I've written.

00:28:46.990 --> 00:28:49.540
I don't want to distract
you with this too much.

00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:53.270
But you know that the magnetic
dipole of the electron

00:28:53.270 --> 00:28:55.310
is given by this quantity.

00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:57.930
Now, you could put a
2 up, and a 2 down.

00:28:57.930 --> 00:29:02.120
And that's why people
actually classically

00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:04.410
there seems to be a 2 down.

00:29:04.410 --> 00:29:08.220
But there's a 2 up, because
it's an effect of the electron.

00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:09.640
And you have this formula.

00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:11.650
The only thing I've
added in that formula

00:29:11.650 --> 00:29:16.390
is a factor of C that is
because of Gaussian units.

00:29:16.390 --> 00:29:20.250
And it allows you to estimate
terms a little more easily.

00:29:20.250 --> 00:29:22.610
So that's the mu
of the electron.

00:29:22.610 --> 00:29:28.600
But the electron apparently
would feel no magnetic field.

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:31.320
You didn't put an
external magnetic field.

00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:37.070
Except that here
you go in this way

00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:40.840
of thinking-- you think
suppose you are the electron.

00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:45.340
You see a proton, which is
a nucleus going around you.

00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:49.750
And a proton going around you
is a current going around you.

00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:52.280
It generates a magnetic field.

00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:54.840
And therefore, you
see a magnetic field

00:29:54.840 --> 00:30:00.260
created by the proton
going around you.

00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:02.400
So there is a magnetic field.

00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:04.720
And there's a magnetic
field experienced

00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:11.440
by the electron--
felt by electron.

00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:19.570
So you can think of
this, the electron.

00:30:19.570 --> 00:30:22.100
Here is the proton
with the plus charge,

00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:25.190
and here's the electron.

00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:29.060
And the electron is
going around the proton.

00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:31.730
Now, from the viewpoint
of the electron,

00:30:31.730 --> 00:30:35.690
the proton is going around him.

00:30:35.690 --> 00:30:38.000
So here is the proton.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.330
Here is the electron
going like that.

00:30:40.330 --> 00:30:42.040
From the viewpoint
of the electron,

00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:44.760
the proton is going like this.

00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:48.350
Also, from the viewpoint
of the electron,

00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:51.335
the proton would be
going in this direction

00:30:51.335 --> 00:30:54.150
and creating a
magnetic field up.

00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:06.570
And the magnetic field
up corresponds actually

00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:11.775
to the idea that the angular
momentum of the electron

00:31:11.775 --> 00:31:16.970
is also up-- L of the
electron is also up.

00:31:16.970 --> 00:31:20.870
So the whole point
of this thing is

00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:25.670
that somehow this magnetic field
is proportional to the angular

00:31:25.670 --> 00:31:27.100
momentum.

00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:29.900
And then, L will come here.

00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:31.770
And here, you have
S. So you have

00:31:31.770 --> 00:31:39.440
L dot S. That's the
fine structure coupling.

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:45.300
Now let me do a little
of this so that we just

00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:49.080
get a bit more feeling,
although it's unfortunately

00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:53.000
a somewhat frustrating exercise.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.790
So let me tell you
what's going on.

00:31:56.790 --> 00:32:00.836
So consider the electron.

00:32:00.836 --> 00:32:05.600
At some point, look at
it and draw a plane.

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:09.000
So the electron-- let's
assume it's going down.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.090
Here is the proton.

00:32:10.090 --> 00:32:11.670
It's going around in circles.

00:32:11.670 --> 00:32:14.660
So here, it's going down.

00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:16.280
The electron is going down.

00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:20.900
Electron, its velocity of
the electron is going down.

00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:24.380
The proton is over here.

00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:28.740
And the electron is
going around like that.

00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:32.350
The proton would produce an
electric field of this form.

00:32:35.770 --> 00:32:42.080
Now, in relativity, the
electric and magnetic fields

00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:44.920
seen by different
observers are different.

00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:48.210
So there is this electric
field that we see.

00:32:48.210 --> 00:32:52.260
We sit here, and we
see in our rest frame

00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:56.330
this proton creates
an electric field.

00:32:56.330 --> 00:33:00.760
And then, from the
viewpoint of the electron,

00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:02.280
the electron is moving.

00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:04.840
And there is an electric field.

00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:09.020
But whenever you are moving
inside an electric field,

00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:12.560
you also see a magnetic field
generated by the motion,

00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:14.910
by relativistic effects.

00:33:14.910 --> 00:33:20.010
The magnetic field
that you see is roughly

00:33:20.010 --> 00:33:27.560
given to first order in
relativity by V cross E over c.

00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:37.120
So V cross E, VE
V cross E over c

00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:39.900
up-- change sign
because of this.

00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:42.740
And the magnetic
field consistently,

00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:45.860
as we would expect,
goes in this direction.

00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:48.210
So it's consistent
with the picture

00:33:48.210 --> 00:33:51.840
that we developed that if you
were the electron, the proton,

00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:53.940
would be going around
in circles like that

00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:55.790
and the magnetic
field would be up.

00:33:58.430 --> 00:34:07.730
Now here I can change the sign
by doing E cross V over c.

00:34:07.730 --> 00:34:11.783
So this is the magnetic
field seen by the electron.

00:34:23.389 --> 00:34:30.010
OK, so we need a little more
work on that magnetic field

00:34:30.010 --> 00:34:33.610
by calculating the
electric field.

00:34:33.610 --> 00:34:36.219
Now, what is the electric field?

00:34:36.219 --> 00:34:39.865
Well, the scalar potential
for the hydrogen atom,

00:34:39.865 --> 00:34:44.670
we write it as minus
e squared over r.

00:34:44.670 --> 00:34:47.159
It's actually not quite
the scalar potential.

00:34:47.159 --> 00:34:49.980
But it is the potential energy.

00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:55.440
It has one factor of e more than
what the scalar potential is.

00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:57.940
Remember, the scalar
potential in electromagnetism

00:34:57.940 --> 00:35:00.260
is charge divided by r.

00:35:00.260 --> 00:35:04.000
So it has one factor of e more.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.100
What is the derivative
of this potential?

00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:12.370
With respect to r, it's
e squared over r squared.

00:35:12.370 --> 00:35:16.990
So the electric field goes
like e over r squared.

00:35:16.990 --> 00:35:29.410
So the electric field is
equal to dV dr divided by e.

00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:34.500
That's the magnitude
of the electric field.

00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:40.150
And its direction is radial from
the viewpoint of the proton.

00:35:40.150 --> 00:35:42.935
The electric field is here.

00:35:47.790 --> 00:35:51.920
So this can be written
as r vector divided by r.

00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:07.000
Therefore, the magnetic field
will-- [INAUDIBLE] this.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:10.320
The magnetic field
now can be calculated.

00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:16.400
And we'll see what
we claimed was

00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:18.930
the relation with
angular momentum.

00:36:18.930 --> 00:36:25.850
Because B prime
is now E cross V.

00:36:25.850 --> 00:36:37.170
So you have 1 over
ec 1 over r dV dr.

00:36:37.170 --> 00:36:38.960
I've taken care of this.

00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:44.770
And now I just have
r cross V. Well,

00:36:44.770 --> 00:36:51.240
r cross V is your angular
momentum if you had p here.

00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:56.970
So we borrow a factor of
the mass of the electron,

00:36:56.970 --> 00:37:06.570
ecm 1 over r dV dr
L, L of the electron.

00:37:11.710 --> 00:37:16.380
p equals mv.

00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:22.180
So we have a nice formula
for B. And then, we

00:37:22.180 --> 00:37:28.460
can go and calculate delta
H. Delta H would then

00:37:28.460 --> 00:37:45.380
be minus mu dot B. And that
would be ge over 2mc spin

00:37:45.380 --> 00:38:01.670
dot L-- mu was given here--
S dot L 1 over r dV dr.

00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:07.150
And that is the split
spin orbit interaction.

00:38:07.150 --> 00:38:10.150
Now, the downside
of this derivation

00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:13.015
is that it has a
relativistic error.

00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:20.370
There's a phenomenon
called Thomas precession

00:38:20.370 --> 00:38:23.870
that affects this result.

00:38:23.870 --> 00:38:26.330
We didn't waste our time.

00:38:26.330 --> 00:38:32.250
The true result is that you
must subtract from this g 1.

00:38:32.250 --> 00:38:37.730
So g must really be
replaced by g minus 1.

00:38:37.730 --> 00:38:41.040
Since g is approximately
2 for the electron,

00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:46.080
the true result is
really 1/2 of this thing.

00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:49.760
So this should not
be in parentheses,

00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:54.200
but true result is this.

00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:59.770
And the mistake that is done
in calculating this spin orbit

00:38:59.770 --> 00:39:04.970
coupling is that this
spin orbit coupling

00:39:04.970 --> 00:39:08.510
affects precession rates.

00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:12.260
All these interactions
of magnetic dipoles

00:39:12.260 --> 00:39:15.540
with magnetic fields
affect precession rates.

00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:18.020
And you have to be a
little more careful here

00:39:18.020 --> 00:39:24.200
that the system where you've
worked, the electron rest frame

00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:26.370
is not quite an inertial system.

00:39:26.370 --> 00:39:29.330
Because it's doing
circular motion.

00:39:29.330 --> 00:39:33.420
So there's an extra correction
that has to be done.

00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:37.350
Thomas precession or Thomas
correction it's called.

00:39:37.350 --> 00:39:41.170
And it would be a
detour of about one hour

00:39:41.170 --> 00:39:43.900
in special relativity
to do it right.

00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:47.676
So Griffiths doesn't do it.

00:39:47.676 --> 00:39:51.010
I don't think Shankar does it.

00:39:51.010 --> 00:39:53.280
Pretty much graduate
books do it.

00:39:56.088 --> 00:39:59.990
So we will not try to do better.

00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:02.550
I mentioned that
fact that this really

00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:06.260
should be reduced to
one half of its value.

00:40:06.260 --> 00:40:08.780
And it's an interesting
system to analyze.

00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:15.170
So Thomas precession is
that relativistic correction

00:40:15.170 --> 00:40:18.540
to precession rates when the
object that is precessing

00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:21.820
is in an accelerated frame.

00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:24.670
And any rotating
frame is accelerated.

00:40:24.670 --> 00:40:31.200
So this result needs correction.

00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:36.450
OK, but let's take this result
as it is-- instead of g,

00:40:36.450 --> 00:40:37.640
g minus 1.

00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:39.810
Let's not worry
too much about it.

00:40:39.810 --> 00:40:44.686
And let's just estimate
how big this effect is.

00:40:44.686 --> 00:40:50.470
It's the last thing I want
to do as a way of motivating

00:40:50.470 --> 00:40:51.460
this subject.

00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:53.850
So delta H is this.

00:40:53.850 --> 00:40:55.770
Let's estimate it.

00:40:55.770 --> 00:41:03.090
Now for estimates, a couple of
things are useful to remember,

00:41:03.090 --> 00:41:08.640
that Bohr radius is h
squared over me squared.

00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:10.740
We did that last time.

00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:13.680
And there's this constant
that is very useful,

00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:18.620
the fine structure constant,
which is e squared over hc.

00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:21.885
And it's about 1 over 137.

00:41:21.885 --> 00:41:27.090
And it helps you estimate
all kinds of things.

00:41:27.090 --> 00:41:31.580
Because it's a rather
complicated number to evaluate,

00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:36.450
you need all kinds of
units and things like that.

00:41:36.450 --> 00:41:43.180
So the charge of the electron
divided by hc being 1 over 137

00:41:43.180 --> 00:41:46.680
is quite nice.

00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:53.050
So let's estimate
delta H. Well, g

00:41:53.050 --> 00:41:58.160
we won't worry-- 2,
1, doesn't matter.

00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:07.530
e mc-- so far, that
is kind of simple.

00:42:07.530 --> 00:42:13.036
Then we have S dot L. Well,
how do I estimate S dot L?

00:42:13.036 --> 00:42:15.740
I don't do too much.

00:42:15.740 --> 00:42:18.850
S spin is multiples of h bar.

00:42:18.850 --> 00:42:23.960
L for an atomic state will be
1, 2, 3, so multiples of h bar.

00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:29.430
So h bar squared,
that's it for S dot L.

00:42:29.430 --> 00:42:33.500
1 over r is 1 over r.

00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:37.570
dV dr is e squared
over r squared.

00:42:37.570 --> 00:42:39.280
And that's it.

00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:43.760
But here, instead of r, I
should put the typical length

00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:46.950
of the hydrogen
atom, which is a0.

00:42:46.950 --> 00:42:48.210
So what do I get?

00:42:53.230 --> 00:42:57.300
I'm sorry, I made
a mistake here.

00:42:57.300 --> 00:42:59.407
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it's up there.

00:42:59.407 --> 00:43:03.079
PROFESSOR: Oh, I
made a mistake here

00:43:03.079 --> 00:43:09.910
in that I didn't put
this factor, 1 over ecm.

00:43:09.910 --> 00:43:11.980
So the e cancels.

00:43:11.980 --> 00:43:15.920
And this is the result
here-- g over 2m

00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:39.900
squared c squared S dot L 1 over
r dV dr. So let me start again.

00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:49.680
1 over m squared c squared h
bar squared 1 over r dV dr--

00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:51.550
that much I got right.

00:43:51.550 --> 00:43:58.810
So this is roughly
1 over [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:58.810 --> 00:44:02.220
of the electron
squared c squared e

00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:08.780
squared over a0 cubed
h squared-- still quite

00:44:08.780 --> 00:44:12.610
messy, but not that terrible.

00:44:12.610 --> 00:44:16.700
So in order to get an
idea of how big this is,

00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:19.720
the ground state energy
of the hydrogen atom

00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:23.400
was e squared over 2a0.

00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:30.610
So let's divide delta H over
the ground state energy.

00:44:30.610 --> 00:44:32.220
And that's how much?

00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:37.850
Well, we have all this
quantity, 1 over m

00:44:37.850 --> 00:44:44.490
squared c squared e
squared a0 cubed h squared.

00:44:44.490 --> 00:44:53.110
And now, we must divide by
e squared over a0 like this.

00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:02.370
Well, the e squareds cancel.

00:45:02.370 --> 00:45:11.800
And we get h squared over m
squared c squared a0 squared.

00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:13.950
You need to know what a0 is.

00:45:13.950 --> 00:45:16.640
Let's just boil it down
to the simplest thing,

00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:20.760
so h squared m
squared c squared.

00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:26.120
a0 squared would be h to
the fourth m squared e

00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:28.540
to the fourth.

00:45:28.540 --> 00:45:33.840
So this is actually e
to the fourth over h

00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:41.200
squared c squared, or e squared
over hc squared, which is alpha

00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:41.700
squared.

00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:45.510
Whew-- lots of work to
get something very nice.

00:45:48.030 --> 00:45:56.910
The ratio of the spin orbit
coupling to the ground state

00:45:56.910 --> 00:46:00.850
energy is 1 over alpha squared.

00:46:00.850 --> 00:46:05.310
It's alpha squared, which
is 1 over 137 squared.

00:46:05.310 --> 00:46:08.040
So it's a pretty small thing.

00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:14.250
It's about 1 over 19,000.

00:46:14.250 --> 00:46:19.850
So when this is called fine
structure of the hydrogen atom,

00:46:19.850 --> 00:46:24.300
it means that it's in
the level in your page

00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:30.040
that you use a few inches
to plot the 13.6 electron

00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:35.450
volts-- well, you're talking
about 20,000 times smaller,

00:46:35.450 --> 00:46:38.820
something that you don't see.

00:46:38.820 --> 00:46:41.410
But of course, it's a
pretty important thing.

00:46:41.410 --> 00:46:48.960
So all in all, in the
conventions of-- this

00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:53.900
is done in Gaussian units.

00:46:53.900 --> 00:47:01.140
In SI units, which is
what Griffiths uses,

00:47:01.140 --> 00:47:08.560
delta H is e squared over
8 pi epsilon 0 1 over m

00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:17.450
squared c squared r cubed S
dot L. That's for reference.

00:47:17.450 --> 00:47:18.275
This is Griffiths.

00:47:22.300 --> 00:47:24.310
But this is correct as well.

00:47:24.310 --> 00:47:27.440
This is the correct value.

00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:30.960
This is the correct
value already taking

00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:33.340
into account the
relativistic correction.

00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:37.270
So here, you're supposed
to let g go to g minus 1.

00:47:37.270 --> 00:47:42.490
So you can put the 1 there,
and it's pretty accurate.

00:47:42.490 --> 00:47:45.590
All right, so what is
the physics question

00:47:45.590 --> 00:47:49.500
we want to answer with
this spin orbit coupling?

00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:54.640
So here it comes.

00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:58.920
You have the hydrogen
atom spectrum.

00:47:58.920 --> 00:48:01.460
And that spectrum you know.

00:48:01.460 --> 00:48:05.050
At L equals 0, you
have one state here.

00:48:05.050 --> 00:48:09.890
Then, that's n
equals 1, n equals 2.

00:48:12.470 --> 00:48:16.580
You have one state here and
one state here at L equals 1.

00:48:16.580 --> 00:48:21.260
Then n equals 3, they start
getting very close together.

00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:25.980
n equals 4 is like that.

00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:31.370
Let's consider if you want
to have spin orbit coupling,

00:48:31.370 --> 00:48:35.880
we must have angular momentum.

00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:42.330
And that's L. And therefore,
let's consider this state here.

00:48:42.330 --> 00:48:47.420
l equals 1, n equals 1--
n equals 2, I'm sorry.

00:48:51.410 --> 00:48:56.520
What happens to those
states, is the question.

00:48:56.520 --> 00:48:59.110
First, how many states
do you have there

00:48:59.110 --> 00:49:02.120
and how should
you think of them?

00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:06.430
Well actually, we know that
an l equals 1 corresponds

00:49:06.430 --> 00:49:07.970
to three states.

00:49:07.970 --> 00:49:13.820
So you'd have lm
with l equals 1.

00:49:13.820 --> 00:49:18.310
And then m can be
1, 0, or minus 1.

00:49:18.310 --> 00:49:20.730
So you have three states.

00:49:20.730 --> 00:49:23.840
But there's not
really three states.

00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:26.420
Because the electron
can have spin.

00:49:26.420 --> 00:49:31.770
So here it is, a tensor product
that appears in your face

00:49:31.770 --> 00:49:36.150
because there is
more than angular

00:49:36.150 --> 00:49:37.430
momentum to the electron.

00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:38.630
There's spin.

00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:42.130
And it's a totally different
vector space, the same particle

00:49:42.130 --> 00:49:45.780
but another vector
space, the spin space.

00:49:45.780 --> 00:49:50.140
So here, you have the possible
spins of the electron.

00:49:50.140 --> 00:49:53.130
So that's another
angular momentum.

00:49:53.130 --> 00:49:57.525
And well, you could have the
plus/minus states, for example.

00:50:00.730 --> 00:50:05.290
So you have three states
here and two states here.

00:50:05.290 --> 00:50:16.440
So this is really six
states, so six states

00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:20.700
whose fate we would
like to understand

00:50:20.700 --> 00:50:23.355
due to this spin orbit coupling.

00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:35.610
So to use the language
of angular momentum,

00:50:35.610 --> 00:50:37.740
instead of writing
plus/minus, you

00:50:37.740 --> 00:50:49.990
could write Smz, if you will--
ms I will call, spin of s.

00:50:49.990 --> 00:50:59.780
You have here spin of 1/2
and states 1/2 or minus 1/2.

00:50:59.780 --> 00:51:01.040
This is the up.

00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:07.040
When the z component of the spin
that we always call m-- m now

00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:09.760
corresponds to the z
component of angular momentum.

00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:12.846
So in general, even
for spin, we use m.

00:51:12.846 --> 00:51:16.410
And we have that our two
spin states of the electron

00:51:16.410 --> 00:51:21.880
are spin 1/2 particle with
plus spin in the z direction,

00:51:21.880 --> 00:51:26.550
spin 1/2 particle with minus
spin in the z direction.

00:51:26.550 --> 00:51:29.380
We usually never
put this 1/2 here.

00:51:29.380 --> 00:51:32.700
But now you have here
really three states--

00:51:32.700 --> 00:51:39.950
1, 1, 1, 0, 1, minus 1,
the first telling you

00:51:39.950 --> 00:51:42.810
about the total
angular momentum.

00:51:42.810 --> 00:51:45.480
Here, the total spin is 1/2.

00:51:45.480 --> 00:51:47.860
But it happens to be
either up or down.

00:51:47.860 --> 00:51:50.550
Here, the total
angular momentum is 1.

00:51:50.550 --> 00:51:56.010
But it happens to be plus
1, 0, or minus 1 here.

00:51:56.010 --> 00:51:58.830
So these are our six states.

00:51:58.830 --> 00:52:01.600
You can combine this with this,
this with that, this with this,

00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:02.320
this with that.

00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:03.870
You make all the products.

00:52:03.870 --> 00:52:06.610
And these are the six
states of the hydrogen

00:52:06.610 --> 00:52:08.090
atom at this level.

00:52:08.090 --> 00:52:13.100
And we wish to know
what happens to them.

00:52:13.100 --> 00:52:17.910
Now, this correction is small.

00:52:17.910 --> 00:52:22.750
So it fits our understanding
of the perturbation theory

00:52:22.750 --> 00:52:25.310
of Feynman-Hellman
in which we try

00:52:25.310 --> 00:52:29.660
to find the corrections
to these things.

00:52:29.660 --> 00:52:35.130
Our difficulty now is a
little serious, however.

00:52:35.130 --> 00:52:37.290
It's the fact that
Feynman-Hellman

00:52:37.290 --> 00:52:39.870
assumed that you had a state.

00:52:39.870 --> 00:52:43.600
And it was an eigenstate of
the corrected Hamiltonian

00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:46.930
as you moved along.

00:52:46.930 --> 00:52:51.220
And then, you could compute
how its energy changes.

00:52:51.220 --> 00:52:56.260
Here, unfortunately, we have a
much more difficult situation.

00:52:56.260 --> 00:52:59.580
These six states that
I'm not listing yet,

00:52:59.580 --> 00:53:07.170
but I will list very soon,
are not obviously eigenstates

00:53:07.170 --> 00:53:12.340
of delta H. In fact, they are
not eigenstates of delta H.

00:53:12.340 --> 00:53:15.790
They're degenerate states,
six degenerate states,

00:53:15.790 --> 00:53:19.440
that are not eigenstates
of delta H. Therefore,

00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:24.360
I cannot use the Feynman-Hellman
theorem until I find what are

00:53:24.360 --> 00:53:28.499
the combinations that
are eigenstates of this

00:53:28.499 --> 00:53:29.040
perturbation.

00:53:32.680 --> 00:53:35.380
So we are a little
bit in trouble.

00:53:35.380 --> 00:53:43.010
Because we have a perturbation
for which these product

00:53:43.010 --> 00:53:52.110
states-- we call them uncoupled
bases-- are not eigenstates.

00:53:52.110 --> 00:53:56.850
Now, we've written this
operator a little naively.

00:53:56.850 --> 00:54:01.270
What does this operator
really mean, S dot L?

00:54:06.150 --> 00:54:15.030
In our tensor products,
it means S1 tensor L1.

00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:19.180
Actually, I'll use
L dot S. I'll always

00:54:19.180 --> 00:54:24.740
put the L information first and
the S information afterward.

00:54:24.740 --> 00:54:29.850
So L dot S is clearly
an operator that

00:54:29.850 --> 00:54:33.910
must be thought to act
on the tensor product.

00:54:33.910 --> 00:54:35.830
Because both have to act.

00:54:35.830 --> 00:54:37.990
S has to act and L has to act.

00:54:37.990 --> 00:54:39.800
So it only lives in
the tensor product.

00:54:39.800 --> 00:54:41.400
So what does it mean?

00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:55.960
It means this-- S2 L2 plus S3
L3, or sum over i Si tensor Li.

00:54:55.960 --> 00:54:59.860
So this is the kind of thing
that you need to understand--

00:54:59.860 --> 00:55:05.080
how do you find for this
operator's eigenstates here?

00:55:07.940 --> 00:55:16.400
So that is our difficulty.

00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:19.910
And that's what
we have to solve.

00:55:19.910 --> 00:55:23.770
We're going to solve it
in the next half hour.

00:55:23.770 --> 00:55:31.140
So it's a complicated operator,
L dot S. But on the other hand,

00:55:31.140 --> 00:55:34.780
we have to use our ideas
that we've learned already

00:55:34.780 --> 00:55:40.090
about summing angular momenta.

00:55:40.090 --> 00:55:49.310
What if I define
J to be L plus S,

00:55:49.310 --> 00:55:58.545
which really means L
tensor 1 plus 1 tensor S?

00:56:03.940 --> 00:56:09.130
So this is what I really
mean by this operator.

00:56:12.170 --> 00:56:17.440
J, as we've demonstrated,
will be an angular momentum,

00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:20.510
because this satisfies the
algebra of angular momentum

00:56:20.510 --> 00:56:23.820
and this satisfies the
algebra of angular momentum.

00:56:23.820 --> 00:56:28.280
So this thing satisfies the
algebra of angular momentum.

00:56:28.280 --> 00:56:32.310
And why do we look at that term?

00:56:32.310 --> 00:56:36.340
Because of the following reason.

00:56:36.340 --> 00:56:39.590
We can square it-- JiJi.

00:56:43.930 --> 00:56:48.870
Now we would have to
square this thing.

00:56:48.870 --> 00:56:50.510
How do you square this thing?

00:56:50.510 --> 00:56:52.590
Well, there's two ways.

00:56:52.590 --> 00:56:56.060
Naively-- L squared
plus L squared plus 2L

00:56:56.060 --> 00:56:59.285
dot S-- basically correct.

00:56:59.285 --> 00:57:01.750
But you can do it a
little more slowly.

00:57:01.750 --> 00:57:07.120
If you square this term,
you get L squared tensor 1.

00:57:07.120 --> 00:57:14.000
If you square this term,
you get 1 tensor S squared.

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:16.210
But when you do
the mixed products,

00:57:16.210 --> 00:57:20.070
you just must take the
i's here and the i's here

00:57:20.070 --> 00:57:21.250
and multiply them.

00:57:21.250 --> 00:57:28.530
So actually, you do get two i's,
the sum over i Li tensor Si.

00:57:35.710 --> 00:57:37.320
This is sum over i.

00:57:37.320 --> 00:57:38.500
This is J squared.

00:57:42.500 --> 00:57:50.420
So basically, what I'm saying
is that J squared naively

00:57:50.420 --> 00:57:56.100
is L squared plus S squared
plus our interaction

00:57:56.100 --> 00:58:01.425
2L dot S defined property.

00:58:04.110 --> 00:58:16.900
So L dot S is equal to 1/2
of J squared minus L squared

00:58:16.900 --> 00:58:19.690
minus S squared.

00:58:19.690 --> 00:58:26.020
And that tells you all kinds of
interesting things about L dot

00:58:26.020 --> 00:58:28.470
S.

00:58:28.470 --> 00:58:34.180
Basically, we can trade
L dot S for J squared,

00:58:34.180 --> 00:58:36.490
L squared, and S squared.

00:58:36.490 --> 00:58:39.590
L squared is very
simple, and S squared

00:58:39.590 --> 00:58:42.190
is extremely simple as well.

00:58:42.190 --> 00:58:46.520
Remember, L squared
commutes with any Li.

00:58:46.520 --> 00:58:51.340
So L squared with
any Li is equal to 0.

00:58:51.340 --> 00:58:55.740
S squared with any
Si is equal to 0.

00:58:55.740 --> 00:58:58.180
And Li's and Si's commute.

00:58:58.180 --> 00:58:59.780
They live in different worlds.

00:58:59.780 --> 00:59:03.280
So L squared and Si's commute.

00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:06.720
S squareds and Li's commute.

00:59:06.720 --> 00:59:11.230
These things are
pretty nice and simple.

00:59:11.230 --> 00:59:15.600
So let's think now
of our Hamiltonian

00:59:15.600 --> 00:59:22.260
and what is happening to it.

00:59:22.260 --> 00:59:31.260
Whenever we had
the hydrogen atom,

00:59:31.260 --> 00:59:39.410
we had a set of commuting
observables H, L squared,

00:59:39.410 --> 00:59:40.120
and Lz.

00:59:44.390 --> 00:59:48.470
It's a complete set of
commuting observables.

00:59:48.470 --> 00:59:53.020
Now, in the hydrogen
atom, you could add to it

00:59:53.020 --> 00:59:57.620
S squared and Sz.

00:59:57.620 --> 01:00:00.160
We didn't talk about
spin at the beginning,

01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:02.760
because we just considered
a particle going

01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:04.520
around the hydrogen atom.

01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:09.330
But if you have spin, the
hydrogen atom Hamiltonian,

01:00:09.330 --> 01:00:13.820
the original one, doesn't
involve spin in any way.

01:00:13.820 --> 01:00:16.890
So certainly, Hamiltonian
commutes with spin,

01:00:16.890 --> 01:00:18.740
with spin z.

01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:21.880
L and S don't talk, so
this is the complete set

01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:24.870
of commuting observables.

01:00:24.870 --> 01:00:27.215
But what happens to this list?

01:00:27.215 --> 01:00:35.210
This is our problem for
H0, the hydrogen atom,

01:00:35.210 --> 01:00:43.450
plus delta H that
has the S dot L.

01:00:43.450 --> 01:00:49.100
Well, what are complete set
of commuting observables?

01:00:49.100 --> 01:00:51.550
This is a very
important question.

01:00:51.550 --> 01:00:53.560
Because this is
what tells you how

01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:56.050
you're going to try to
organize the spectrum.

01:00:56.050 --> 01:01:01.880
So we could have H,
the total, H total.

01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:08.960
And what else?

01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:14.630
Well, can I still
have L squared here?

01:01:18.450 --> 01:01:23.135
Can I include L squared and say
it commutes with the total H?

01:01:27.229 --> 01:01:30.170
A little worrisome,
but actually,

01:01:30.170 --> 01:01:35.500
you know that L squared commutes
with the original Hamiltonian.

01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:38.260
Now, the question is
whether L squared commutes

01:01:38.260 --> 01:01:40.320
with this extra piece.

01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:44.110
Well, but L squared
commutes with any Li.

01:01:44.110 --> 01:01:47.730
And it doesn't even talk
to S. So L squared is safe.

01:01:47.730 --> 01:01:50.400
L squared we can keep.

01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:55.660
OK, S squared-- can
we keep S squared?

01:01:55.660 --> 01:01:57.480
Well, S squared was here.

01:01:57.480 --> 01:02:01.420
So it commuted with the
Hamiltonian, and that was good.

01:02:01.420 --> 01:02:06.000
S squared commutes with any
Si, and it doesn't talk to L.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.730
So S squared can stay.

01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:13.550
But that's not good enough.

01:02:13.550 --> 01:02:16.950
We won't be able to solve
the problem with this still.

01:02:16.950 --> 01:02:17.790
We need more.

01:02:21.100 --> 01:02:22.166
How about Lz?

01:02:22.166 --> 01:02:24.885
It was here, so
let's try our luck.

01:02:29.010 --> 01:02:32.340
Any opinions on Lz--
can we keep it or not?

01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:38.838
Yes.

01:02:38.838 --> 01:02:40.182
AUDIENCE: I don't think so.

01:02:40.182 --> 01:02:44.117
Because in the J term, we
have Lx's and Ly's, which

01:02:44.117 --> 01:02:45.340
don't commute with Lz.

01:02:45.340 --> 01:02:47.980
PROFESSOR: Right,
it can't be kept.

01:02:47.980 --> 01:02:57.540
Here, this term has SxLx
plus SyLy plus SzLz.

01:02:57.540 --> 01:03:02.370
And Lz doesn't
commute with this one.

01:03:02.370 --> 01:03:04.995
So no, you can't
keep Lz-- no good.

01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:14.496
On the other hand, let's
think about J squared.

01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:22.670
J squared is here.

01:03:22.670 --> 01:03:26.685
And J squared commutes with
L squared and with S squared.

01:03:29.690 --> 01:03:36.600
J squared, therefore, is--
well, let me say it this way.

01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:42.460
Here is L dot S, which
is our extra interaction.

01:03:42.460 --> 01:03:44.920
Here we have this thing.

01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:49.700
I would like to say
on behalf of J squared

01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:56.200
that we can include
it here, J squared,

01:03:56.200 --> 01:04:00.840
because J squared is
really pretty much the same

01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:05.860
as L dot S up to this L
squared and S squared.

01:04:05.860 --> 01:04:09.640
But J squared commutes with
L squared and S squared.

01:04:09.640 --> 01:04:11.400
I should probably
write it there.

01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:22.350
J squared commutes
with L squared.

01:04:22.350 --> 01:04:29.010
And J squared communicates with
S squared that we have here.

01:04:29.010 --> 01:04:38.300
And moreover, we have over
here that J squared therefore

01:04:38.300 --> 01:04:41.960
will commute, or it's
pretty much the same,

01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:45.600
as L dot S. J squared
with L dot S would

01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:50.810
be J squared times
this thing, which is 0.

01:04:50.810 --> 01:04:55.840
So J squared commutes
with this term.

01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:59.210
And it commutes with
the Hamiltonian,

01:04:59.210 --> 01:05:02.410
your original
hydrogen Hamiltonian.

01:05:02.410 --> 01:05:06.240
So J squared can be added here.

01:05:09.670 --> 01:05:13.980
J square is a good
operator to have.

01:05:13.980 --> 01:05:19.110
And now we can get one more
kind of free from here.

01:05:19.110 --> 01:05:21.290
It's Jz.

01:05:21.290 --> 01:05:23.280
Z

01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:29.630
Because Jz commutes
with J squared.

01:05:29.630 --> 01:05:32.140
Jz commutes with these things.

01:05:32.140 --> 01:05:38.090
And Jz, which is a symmetry
of the original Hamiltonian,

01:05:38.090 --> 01:05:44.342
also commutes with our new
interaction, the L dot S,

01:05:44.342 --> 01:05:47.770
which is proportional
to J squared.

01:05:47.770 --> 01:05:53.340
So you have to go
through this yourselves

01:05:53.340 --> 01:05:56.980
probably even a little
more slowly than I've gone.

01:05:56.980 --> 01:05:59.660
Just check that
everything that I'm

01:05:59.660 --> 01:06:02.480
saying about whatever
commutes commutes.

01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:06.350
So for example, when I say
that J squared commutes

01:06:06.350 --> 01:06:09.700
with L dot S, it's
because I can put

01:06:09.700 --> 01:06:12.590
instead of L dot S all of this.

01:06:12.590 --> 01:06:15.920
And go slowly through this.

01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:22.030
So this is actually the complete
set of committing observables.

01:06:22.030 --> 01:06:25.510
And it's basically
saying to us, try

01:06:25.510 --> 01:06:31.755
to diagonalize this thing
with total angular momentum.

01:06:34.590 --> 01:06:38.290
So it's about time
to really do it.

01:06:38.290 --> 01:06:39.790
We haven't done it yet.

01:06:39.790 --> 01:06:43.930
But now the part that
we have to do now,

01:06:43.930 --> 01:06:46.470
it's kind of a nice exercise.

01:06:46.470 --> 01:06:48.970
And it's fun.

01:06:48.970 --> 01:06:52.180
Now, there's one problem
in the homework set

01:06:52.180 --> 01:06:55.710
that sort of uses
this kind of thing.

01:06:55.710 --> 01:07:01.850
And I will suggest there to
Will and Aram that tomorrow,

01:07:01.850 --> 01:07:07.120
they spend some time discussing
it and helping you with it.

01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:10.930
The last problem
in the homework set

01:07:10.930 --> 01:07:15.060
would've been better if you
had a little more time for it

01:07:15.060 --> 01:07:17.930
and you had more time to
digest what I'm doing today.

01:07:17.930 --> 01:07:21.920
But nevertheless,
go to recitation,

01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:23.490
learn more about the problem.

01:07:23.490 --> 01:07:26.740
It will not be all
that difficult.

01:07:26.740 --> 01:07:31.900
OK, so we're trying
now to finally form

01:07:31.900 --> 01:07:33.890
another basis of states.

01:07:33.890 --> 01:07:36.970
We had these six states.

01:07:36.970 --> 01:07:39.020
And we're going to
try to organize them

01:07:39.020 --> 01:07:45.480
in a better way-- as eigenstates
of the total angular momentum L

01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:51.210
plus S. So I'm going to
write them here in this way.

01:07:51.210 --> 01:07:58.830
Here is one of the
states of this L equals

01:07:58.830 --> 01:08:04.330
1 electron, the 1, 1
coupled to the 1/2, 1/2.

01:08:04.330 --> 01:08:20.740
Here are two more states- 1, 0,
1/2, 1/2, 1, 1, 1/2, minus 1/2,

01:08:20.740 --> 01:08:27.850
so the 1, 0 with the top,
the 1, 1 with the bottom.

01:08:27.850 --> 01:08:35.020
Here are two more
states-- 1, 0 with 1/2,

01:08:35.020 --> 01:08:43.620
minus 1/2 and 1,
minus 1 with 1/2, 1/2.

01:08:47.790 --> 01:08:56.100
And here is the last state--
1, minus 1 with 1/2, minus 1.

01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:05.832
These are our six states.

01:09:05.832 --> 01:09:09.654
And I've organized them
in a nice way actually.

01:09:12.760 --> 01:09:14.990
I've organized
them in such a way

01:09:14.990 --> 01:09:21.750
that you can read what is
the value of Jz over h bar.

01:09:21.750 --> 01:09:28.563
Remember, Jz is 1
over h bar Lz plus Sz.

01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:35.479
So what is it?

01:09:35.479 --> 01:09:39.760
These are, I claim,
eigenstates of Jz.

01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:40.899
Why?

01:09:40.899 --> 01:09:42.569
Because let's act on them.

01:09:42.569 --> 01:09:45.510
Suppose I act with
Jz on this state.

01:09:45.510 --> 01:09:47.930
The Lz comes here and says, 1.

01:09:47.930 --> 01:09:50.890
The Sz comes here and says, 1/2.

01:09:50.890 --> 01:09:56.337
So the sum of them give you
Jz over h bar equal to 3/2.

01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:05.240
And that's why I organized
these states in such a way

01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:10.510
that these second things add up
to the same value-- 0 and 1/2,

01:10:10.510 --> 01:10:12.590
1 and minus 1/2.

01:10:12.590 --> 01:10:16.360
So if you act with
Jz on this state,

01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:19.330
it's an eigenstate with Jz.

01:10:19.330 --> 01:10:22.470
Here, 0 contribution, here 1/2.

01:10:22.470 --> 01:10:26.700
So this is with plus 1/2.

01:10:26.700 --> 01:10:31.130
Here, you have 0 and minus 1/2,
minus 1, and that is minus 1/2.

01:10:34.330 --> 01:10:36.930
And here you have minus 3/2.

01:10:40.990 --> 01:10:43.943
OK, questions.

01:10:48.980 --> 01:10:50.330
We've written the states.

01:10:50.330 --> 01:10:55.240
And I'm evaluating the total z
component of angular momentum.

01:10:55.240 --> 01:10:58.470
And these two states
are like that.

01:10:58.470 --> 01:11:02.150
So what does our theorem
guarantee for us?

01:11:02.150 --> 01:11:06.670
Our theorem guarantees that we
have-- in this tensor product,

01:11:06.670 --> 01:11:10.770
there is an algebra of angular
momentum of the Jz operators.

01:11:10.770 --> 01:11:14.270
And the states have to
fall into representations

01:11:14.270 --> 01:11:15.930
of those operators.

01:11:15.930 --> 01:11:19.920
So you must have angular
momentum multiplets.

01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:23.710
So at this moment,
you can figure out

01:11:23.710 --> 01:11:30.240
what angular momentum you're
going to get for the result.

01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:36.770
Here we obtained a
maximum Jz of 3/2.

01:11:36.770 --> 01:11:42.005
So we must get a J
equals 3/2 multiplet.

01:11:46.100 --> 01:11:48.660
Because a J equaling
3/2 multiplets

01:11:48.660 --> 01:11:55.650
has Jz 3/2, 1/2,
minus 1/2, and 0.

01:11:55.650 --> 01:12:01.510
So actually, this state must be
the top state of the multiplet.

01:12:01.510 --> 01:12:05.500
This state must be the bottom
state of the multiplet.

01:12:05.500 --> 01:12:10.160
I don't know which one is the
middle state of the multiplet

01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:12.250
and which one is here.

01:12:12.250 --> 01:12:15.670
But we have four states
here, four states.

01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:22.940
So one linear combination
of these two states

01:12:22.940 --> 01:12:29.190
must be, then, that Jz equals
1/2 state of the multiplet.

01:12:29.190 --> 01:12:31.600
And one inner combination
of these two states

01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:35.220
must be that Jz equals minus
1/2 state of the multiplet.

01:12:35.220 --> 01:12:36.750
Which one is it?

01:12:36.750 --> 01:12:38.180
I don't know.

01:12:38.180 --> 01:12:40.010
But we can figure it out.

01:12:40.010 --> 01:12:41.930
We'll figure it out in a second.

01:12:41.930 --> 01:12:44.640
Once you get this
J 3/2 multiplet,

01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:48.270
there will be one linear
combination here left over

01:12:48.270 --> 01:12:51.500
and one linear combination
here left over.

01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:56.300
Those are two state, one with
Jz plus 1/2 and one with Jz

01:12:56.300 --> 01:12:58.060
equals minus 1/2.

01:12:58.060 --> 01:13:01.740
So you also get a J
equals 1/2 multiplet.

01:13:07.670 --> 01:13:11.290
So the whole tensor
product of six

01:13:11.290 --> 01:13:18.260
states-- it was the
tensor product of a spin 1

01:13:18.260 --> 01:13:21.620
with a spin 1/2.

01:13:21.620 --> 01:13:24.560
So we write it like this.

01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:32.940
The tensor product of a
spin 1 with a spin 1/2

01:13:32.940 --> 01:13:43.660
will give you a total
spin 3/2 plus total spin

01:13:43.660 --> 01:13:52.940
1/2-- funny formula.

01:13:52.940 --> 01:13:56.820
Here is the tensor
product, the tensor

01:13:56.820 --> 01:14:01.710
product of these three
states with these two states.

01:14:01.710 --> 01:14:08.720
This can be written as 3
times 2 is equal to 4 plus 2

01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:11.870
in terms of number of states.

01:14:11.870 --> 01:14:16.020
The tensor product of
this spin 1 and spin 1/2

01:14:16.020 --> 01:14:21.040
gives you a spin 3/2
multiplet with four states

01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:23.520
and a spin 1/2 multiplet
with two states.

01:14:27.700 --> 01:14:33.040
So how do you calculate what
are the states themselves?

01:14:35.890 --> 01:14:38.380
So the states themselves
are the following.

01:14:47.100 --> 01:14:51.280
All right, here I have them.

01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:57.560
I claim that the J
equals 3/2 states,

01:14:57.560 --> 01:15:02.610
m equals 3/2 states, the
top state of that multiplet

01:15:02.610 --> 01:15:11.860
can only be the state here,
the 1, 1 tensor 1/2, 1/2.

01:15:11.860 --> 01:15:18.490
And there's no way any other
state can be put on the right.

01:15:18.490 --> 01:15:22.020
Because there's no other
state with total z component

01:15:22.020 --> 01:15:24.160
of angular momentum equals 3/2.

01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:26.490
So that must be the state.

01:15:26.490 --> 01:15:33.000
Similarly, the J
equals 3/2, m equals

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:40.980
minus 3/2 state must be the
bottom one-- 1, minus 1, 1/2,

01:15:40.980 --> 01:15:44.220
minus 1/2.

01:15:44.220 --> 01:15:46.490
The one that we
wish to figure out

01:15:46.490 --> 01:15:53.710
is the next state here, which is
the J equals 3/2, m equals 1/2.

01:15:53.710 --> 01:15:57.200
It's a linear
combination of these two.

01:15:57.200 --> 01:15:58.390
But which one?

01:16:01.060 --> 01:16:05.250
That is kind of the last
thing we want to do.

01:16:05.250 --> 01:16:08.520
Because it will pretty much
solve the rest of the problem.

01:16:13.880 --> 01:16:17.540
So how do we solve for this?

01:16:17.540 --> 01:16:25.270
Well, we had this
basic relation that we

01:16:25.270 --> 01:16:36.470
know how to lower or raise
states of angular momentum--

01:16:36.470 --> 01:16:43.530
m times m plus/minus 1 J--
I should have written it

01:16:43.530 --> 01:16:52.510
J plus/minus Jm equals
h bar square root.

01:16:52.510 --> 01:16:56.790
More space for everybody
to see this-- J times

01:16:56.790 --> 01:17:02.180
J plus 1 minus m
times m plus/minus 1.

01:17:02.180 --> 01:17:08.120
Close the square
root-- Jm plus/minus 1.

01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:14.020
So what I should try to
do is lower this state,

01:17:14.020 --> 01:17:19.630
try to find this state
by acting with J minus.

01:17:19.630 --> 01:17:22.660
So let me try to
lower the state, so

01:17:22.660 --> 01:17:31.170
J minus on this state, on
J equals 3/2, m equals 3/2.

01:17:31.170 --> 01:17:39.770
I can go to that formula and
write it as h bar square root.

01:17:39.770 --> 01:17:47.260
J is 3/2, so 3/2 times
5/2 minus m, which is 3/2,

01:17:47.260 --> 01:17:49.960
times m minus 1, 1/2.

01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:57.570
We're doing the minus--
times the state 3/2, 1/2.

01:17:57.570 --> 01:18:00.030
So the state we want is here.

01:18:00.030 --> 01:18:03.570
And it's obtained by
doing J minus on that.

01:18:03.570 --> 01:18:05.320
But we want the number here.

01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:08.340
So that's why I did
all these square roots.

01:18:08.340 --> 01:18:16.650
And that just gives h bar
square root of 3, 3/2, 1/2.

01:18:16.650 --> 01:18:19.670
Well, that still doesn't
calculate it for me.

01:18:19.670 --> 01:18:21.510
But it comes very close.

01:18:29.490 --> 01:18:33.250
So you have it there.

01:18:33.250 --> 01:18:39.580
Now I want to do this but
using the right hand side.

01:18:39.580 --> 01:18:41.560
So look at the right hand side.

01:18:41.560 --> 01:18:52.570
We want to do J minus, but
on 1, 1 tensor 1/2, 1/2.

01:18:52.570 --> 01:18:55.820
So I applied J minus
to the left hand side.

01:18:55.820 --> 01:19:01.130
Now we have to apply J minus
to the right hand side.

01:19:01.130 --> 01:19:19.680
But J minus is L minus plus S
minus on 1, 1 tensor 1/2, 1/2.

01:19:19.680 --> 01:19:22.750
When this acts, it
acts on the first.

01:19:22.750 --> 01:19:31.570
So you get L minus on
1, 1 tensor 1/2, 1/2.

01:19:31.570 --> 01:19:38.280
And in the second term,
you get plus 1, 1 tensor S

01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:40.520
minus on 1/2, 1/2.

01:19:44.420 --> 01:19:47.540
Now, what is L minus on 1, 1?

01:19:47.540 --> 01:19:50.330
You can use the same formula.

01:19:50.330 --> 01:19:51.450
It's 1, 1.

01:19:51.450 --> 01:19:53.250
And it's an angular momentum.

01:19:53.250 --> 01:20:00.350
So it just goes on and
gives you h bar square

01:20:00.350 --> 01:20:05.520
root of 1 times 2
minus 1 times 0.

01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:10.720
1, 0-- it lowers
it-- times 1/2, 1/2.

01:20:15.080 --> 01:20:19.270
Let me go here-- plus 1, 1.

01:20:19.270 --> 01:20:21.980
And what is S minus on this?

01:20:21.980 --> 01:20:26.390
Use the formula
with J equals 1/2.

01:20:26.390 --> 01:20:37.460
So this is h bar square root of
1/2 times 3/2 minus 1/2 times

01:20:37.460 --> 01:20:43.522
minus 1/2 times 1/2 minus 1/2.

01:20:43.522 --> 01:20:48.620
Whew-- well not too difficult.

01:20:48.620 --> 01:20:57.630
But this gives you h over square
root of 2, 1, 0 tensor 1/2,

01:20:57.630 --> 01:21:01.440
1/2 plus just h bar.

01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:11.030
This whole thing is 1-- 1,
1 tensor 1/2, minus 1/2.

01:21:11.030 --> 01:21:16.800
OK, stop a second to
see what's happened.

01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:18.730
We had this equality.

01:21:18.730 --> 01:21:20.260
And we acted with J minus.

01:21:20.260 --> 01:21:23.390
Acting on the left,
it gives us a number

01:21:23.390 --> 01:21:25.980
times the state we want.

01:21:25.980 --> 01:21:29.950
Acting on the
right, we got this.

01:21:29.950 --> 01:21:36.220
So actually, equating this
to that, or left hand side

01:21:36.220 --> 01:21:41.270
to right hand side, we finally
found the state 3/2, 1/2.

01:21:41.270 --> 01:21:49.630
So the state 3/2,
1/2 is as follows.

01:21:54.410 --> 01:22:06.930
3/2, 1/2 is-- you must
divide by that square root.

01:22:06.930 --> 01:22:09.435
So you get the square
root of 3 down.

01:22:09.435 --> 01:22:12.280
The h bars cancel.

01:22:12.280 --> 01:22:18.290
So here it is, a very nice
little formula-- 2 over 3,

01:22:18.290 --> 01:22:26.450
1, 0 tensor 1/2, 1/2 plus
1 over square root of 3,

01:22:26.450 --> 01:22:34.010
1, 1 tensor 1/2, minus 1/2.

01:22:34.010 --> 01:22:36.730
So we have the top
state of the multiplet.

01:22:40.070 --> 01:22:43.910
We have the next state
of the multiplet.

01:22:43.910 --> 01:22:47.240
We have-- I'm sorry, the
top state of the multiplet

01:22:47.240 --> 01:22:49.250
was this.

01:22:49.250 --> 01:22:51.830
You have the bottom
state of the multiplet,

01:22:51.830 --> 01:22:53.890
the middle state
of the multiplet.

01:22:53.890 --> 01:22:58.920
What you're missing is the
bottom and the middle term.

01:22:58.920 --> 01:23:02.935
And this one can be
obtained in many ways.

01:23:05.660 --> 01:23:08.990
One way would be to
raise this state.

01:23:08.990 --> 01:23:12.330
The minus 3/2 could
be raised by one unit

01:23:12.330 --> 01:23:14.710
and do exactly the same thing.

01:23:14.710 --> 01:23:24.760
Well, the result is square root
of 2 over 3, 1, 0 tensor 1/2,

01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:30.550
minus 1/2 plus 1 over
square root of 3.

01:23:30.550 --> 01:23:35.240
That square root of 2
doesn't look right to me now.

01:23:35.240 --> 01:23:37.830
I must have copied it wrong.

01:23:37.830 --> 01:23:43.940
It's 1 over square root of
3-- 1 over square root of 3,

01:23:43.940 --> 01:23:50.660
1, minus 1 tensor 1/2, 1/2.

01:23:50.660 --> 01:23:52.365
So you've built that
whole multiplet.

01:23:55.420 --> 01:24:00.480
And this state, as we said,
was a linear combination

01:24:00.480 --> 01:24:01.996
of the two possible states.

01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:09.430
This 3 minus 1/2 was
a linear combination

01:24:09.430 --> 01:24:11.530
of these two possible states.

01:24:11.530 --> 01:24:14.690
So the other states
that are left over,

01:24:14.690 --> 01:24:17.785
the other linear
combinations, form

01:24:17.785 --> 01:24:21.090
the J equals 1/2 multiplet.

01:24:21.090 --> 01:24:26.050
So basically, every state must
be orthogonal to each other.

01:24:26.050 --> 01:24:35.200
So the other state, the 1/2, 1/2
and the 1/2, minus 1/2 of the J

01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:41.430
equals 1/2 multiplet must
be this orthogonal to this.

01:24:41.430 --> 01:24:44.810
And this must be
orthogonal to that.

01:24:44.810 --> 01:24:50.760
So those formulas are easily
found by orthogonality.

01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:56.760
So I'll conclude by
writing them-- minus 1

01:24:56.760 --> 01:25:04.010
over square root of
3, 1, 0, 1/2, 1/2

01:25:04.010 --> 01:25:13.170
plus the square root of 2
over 3, 1, 1, 1/2, minus 1/2.

01:25:13.170 --> 01:25:19.770
And here, you get 1 over
square root of 3, 1, 0, 1/2,

01:25:19.770 --> 01:25:31.340
minus 1/2 minus 2 over
square root of 3, 1, minus 1

01:25:31.340 --> 01:25:33.380
tensor 1/2, 1/2.

01:25:36.350 --> 01:25:45.870
So lots of terms, a little
hard to read-- I apologize.

01:25:45.870 --> 01:25:53.120
Now, the punchline here is
that you've found these states.

01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:57.050
And the claim is
that these are states

01:25:57.050 --> 01:26:00.610
in which L dot S is diagonal.

01:26:00.610 --> 01:26:04.310
And it's kind of obvious
that that should be the case.

01:26:04.310 --> 01:26:07.830
Because what was L dot S?

01:26:07.830 --> 01:26:20.150
So one last formula--
L dot S equals

01:26:20.150 --> 01:26:26.220
1/2 of J squared minus L
squared minus S squared.

01:26:26.220 --> 01:26:29.770
Now, in terms of
eigenvalues, this

01:26:29.770 --> 01:26:36.930
is 1/2 h squared J times
J plus 1 minus L times L

01:26:36.930 --> 01:26:42.440
plus 1 minus S times S plus 1.

01:26:42.440 --> 01:26:45.160
Now, all the states
that we built

01:26:45.160 --> 01:26:48.070
have definite
values of J squared,

01:26:48.070 --> 01:26:50.450
definite values of S squared.

01:26:50.450 --> 01:26:52.740
Because L was 1.

01:26:52.740 --> 01:26:55.270
And S is 1/2.

01:26:55.270 --> 01:27:03.400
So here you go h squared over 2
J times J plus 1 minus 1 times

01:27:03.400 --> 01:27:09.450
2 is 2 minus 1/2
times 3/2 is 3/4.

01:27:12.050 --> 01:27:13.630
And that's the whole story.

01:27:13.630 --> 01:27:17.170
The whole story in a sense
has been summarized by this.

01:27:17.170 --> 01:27:22.210
We have four states
with J equals 3/2

01:27:22.210 --> 01:27:25.850
and two states
with J equals 1/2.

01:27:25.850 --> 01:27:31.190
So these six states
that you have here--

01:27:31.190 --> 01:27:33.690
split because of
this interaction

01:27:33.690 --> 01:27:42.700
into four states that have
J equal to 3/2 and two

01:27:42.700 --> 01:27:47.370
states that have J equal to 1/2.

01:27:47.370 --> 01:27:49.640
And you plug the numbers here.

01:27:49.640 --> 01:27:51.456
And that gives you the
amount of splitting.

01:27:54.790 --> 01:28:02.810
So actually, this height
that this goes up here

01:28:02.810 --> 01:28:05.230
is h squared over 2.

01:28:05.230 --> 01:28:08.030
And this is minus h
squared by the time you

01:28:08.030 --> 01:28:11.860
put the numbers J, 3/2, and 1/2.

01:28:11.860 --> 01:28:17.220
So all our work was because
the Hamiltonian at the end

01:28:17.220 --> 01:28:20.360
was simple in J squared.

01:28:20.360 --> 01:28:23.240
And therefore, we
needed J multiplets.

01:28:23.240 --> 01:28:27.900
J multiplets are the addition
of angular momentum multiplets.

01:28:27.900 --> 01:28:31.270
In a sense, we don't have
to construct these things

01:28:31.270 --> 01:28:34.910
if you don't want to calculate
very explicit details.

01:28:34.910 --> 01:28:37.960
Once you have that,
you have everything.

01:28:37.960 --> 01:28:42.620
This product of angular
momentum 1, angular momentum 1/2

01:28:42.620 --> 01:28:45.800
gave you total
angular momentum 3/2

01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:48.990
and 1/2-- four
states, two states.

01:28:48.990 --> 01:28:53.380
So four states split one way,
two states split the other way,

01:28:53.380 --> 01:28:55.210
and that's the end of the story.

01:28:55.210 --> 01:28:58.340
So more of this in recitation
and more of this all

01:28:58.340 --> 01:29:00.580
of next week.

01:29:00.580 --> 01:29:02.790
We'll see you then.
