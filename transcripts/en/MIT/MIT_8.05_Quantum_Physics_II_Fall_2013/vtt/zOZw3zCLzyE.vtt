00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:27.620
PROFESSOR: OK, so let me go
back to what we were doing.

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.090
The plan for today
is as follows.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.240
We're going to look at
this unitary time evolution

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:39.800
and calculate this operator
u, given the Hamiltonian.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.170
That will be the first
order of business today.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.660
Then we will look
at the Heisenberg

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.090
picture of quantum mechanics.

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.270
And the Heisenberg picture
of quantum mechanics

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.140
is one where the operators,
the Schrodinger operators,

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.510
acquire time dependence.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:07.480
And it's a pretty useful way of
seeing things, a pretty useful

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.620
way of calculating
things as well,

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:16.360
and makes the relation between
classical mechanics and quantum

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.270
mechanics more obvious.

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.530
So it's a very important tool.

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.890
So we'll discuss that.

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.020
We'll find the Heisenberg
equations of motion

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.270
and solve them for a
particular case today.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.290
All this material is not so
to be covered in the test.

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.740
The only part-- of course,
the first few things

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.750
I will say today about solving
for the unitary operator

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.770
you've done in other ways, and
I will do it again this time.

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.510
So going back to what we
were saying last time,

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.570
we postulated unitary
time evolution.

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:06.300
We said that psi at t was given
by some operator U of t t0 psi

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.800
t0.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.170
And then we found
that this equation

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.870
implied the Schrodinger
equation with a Hamiltonian

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.480
given by the
following expression.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:32.830
ih dU dt of t t0
u dagger of t t0.

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.740
So that was our derivation
of the Schrodinger equation.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.820
We start with the
time evolution.

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.070
We found that, whenever we
declare that states evolve

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.870
in time in that way, they
satisfy a first order time

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.230
differential equation
of the Schrodinger form

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.491
in which the Hamiltonian
is given in terms of U

00:02:56.491 --> 00:02:58.240
by this equation.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.160
And we talked about
this operator.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.890
First we showed that it
doesn't depend really on t0.

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.250
Then we showed that
it's Hermitian.

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.430
It has units of energy.

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:15.020
And as you may have seen
already in the notes,

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.610
there is a very
clear correspondence

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.330
between this
operator and the way

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:29.870
the dynamics follows with
the ideas of Poisson brackets

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.740
that are the precursors
of commutators

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.480
from classical mechanics.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.040
So that's in the notes.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.050
I will not go in detail in this.

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:43.130
Many of you may have not
heard of Poisson brackets.

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.880
It's an interesting
thing, and really that

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.680
will be good enough.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.180
So our goal today
is to find U given

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.740
H, because as we mentioned
last time, for physics

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.380
it is typically more
easy to invent a quantum

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.340
system by postulating
a Hamiltonian

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:09.290
and then solving it than
postulating a time evolution

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:10.180
operator.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:24.270
So our goal in general is to
find U of t t0 given H of t.

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.060
That's what we're
supposed to do.

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.320
So the first thing
I'm going to do

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.510
is multiply this equation by u.

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.500
By multiplying this equation
by a u from the right,

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:50.110
I will write first this
term. ih dU dt of t t0

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:55.012
is equal to H of t U of t t0.

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.990
So I multiplied this
equation by u from the right.

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:06.090
This operator is unitary,
so u dagger u is one.

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:09.430
That's why this equation
cleaned up to this.

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:13.420
Now there's no confusion
really here with derivatives,

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:17.930
so I might this well write
them with normal derivatives.

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:27.886
So I'll write this
equation as d dt of U t t0

00:05:27.886 --> 00:05:31.780
is equal to H of t U of t t0.

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.960
You should be able to
look at that equation

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:50.230
and say I see the
Schrodinger equation there.

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:51.930
How?

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:59.720
Imagine that you have a psi
of t0 here, and you put it in.

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:06.730
Then the right hand side becomes
h and t acting on psi of t.

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:14.110
And on the left hand
side, this psi of t0

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:18.200
can be put inside the derivative
because it doesn't depend on t.

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:23.640
Therefore this becomes
ih bar d dt of psi of t.

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:29.530
So the Schrodinger
equation is there.

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:31.850
OK so now let's solve this.

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:33.680
We'll go through three cases.

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:37.400
Case one, h is time independent.

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:48.480
So we're doing this
sort of quickly.

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:54.240
So H of t is really H like that.

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:58.700
No explicit time
dependence there.

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:00.510
So what do we have?

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:02.730
ih bar.

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:13.210
Let's write dU dt
is equal H times U.

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:18.020
And we tried to write a
solution of the form U

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:24.630
use equal to e to the minus
iHt over h bar times U0.

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:32.600
Does that work?

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:40.030
Well, we can think du dt and ih.

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:42.090
So we get ih.

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:48.420
When I take dU dt, I have to
differentiate this exponential.

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:53.530
And now in this exponential,
this full operator H is there.

00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:57.850
But we are differentiating
with respect to time.

00:07:57.850 --> 00:08:00.970
And H doesn't depend
on time, so this is not

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:03.330
a very difficult situation.

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:06.640
You could imagine the
power series expansion.

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:10.340
And H, as far as
this derivative goes,

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:12.340
is like if it would
be even a number.

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:15.200
It wouldn't make any
difference if it's an operator.

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:20.040
So the derivative with
respect to time of this thing

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:25.600
is minus iH over h times
the same exponential.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:38.159
Moreover, the position
of this h could be here,

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:41.419
or it could be to the right.

00:08:41.419 --> 00:08:45.030
It cannot be to the
right of U0 though,

00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:49.630
because this is a matrix, a
constant matrix that we've put

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:54.590
in here as a possible thing
for boundary condition.

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:58.320
So so far we've taken
this derivative,

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:03.706
and then i's cancel, the h
bar cancels, and you get H.

00:09:03.706 --> 00:09:07.340
But this whole
thing is, again, U.

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:10.940
So the equation has been solved.

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:14.440
So try this.

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:15.630
And it works.

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:25.120
So having this solution
we can write, for example,

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:31.410
that U of t t0 is going
to be e to the minus

00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:38.110
iHt over h bar, some
constant matrix.

00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:44.940
When t is equal to t0, this
matrix becomes the unit matrix.

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:51.180
So this is e to the minus
iHt0 over h bar times U0.

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:59.140
And therefore from
here, U0 is the inverse

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:06.520
of this matrix, which is nothing
else but e to the iHt0 over h

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:08.140
bar.

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:18.910
So I can substitute back
here what U0 is and finally

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:31.170
obtain U of t t0 is e to the
minus iH over h bar t minus t0.

00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:41.180
And this is for h
time independent.

00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:43.900
And that's our solution.

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:46.435
There's very little
to add to this.

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:53.710
We discussed that in
recitation on Thursday.

00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:56.560
This unitary operator
you've been seeing that

00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:59.420
from the beginning of
the course in some sense,

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:02.800
that you evolve
energy eigenstate.

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:07.110
If this acts on any
energy eigenstate,

00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:13.380
h is an energy-- if you act
here on an energy eigenstate,

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:17.030
the energy eigenstate is an
eigenstate precisely for H,

00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:19.670
you can put just
the number here.

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:26.700
That is e to the, say,
alpha h on a state psi

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:38.290
n is equal to e to the
alpha en psi n if h on psi n

00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:43.110
is equal to en on psi n.

00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:48.910
So the function of an operator
acting on an eigenstate

00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:54.560
is just the function
evaluated at the eigenvalue.

00:11:54.560 --> 00:12:01.600
So this is a rule that you've
been using a really long time.

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:05.140
OK, so when h is time
independent, that's what it is.

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:10.110
How about when h has a
little time dependence?

00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:13.880
What do I call a
little time dependence?

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:19.590
A little time dependence
is an idea, the sign

00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:24.050
to make it possible for
you to solve the equation,

00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:26.800
even though it has
some time dependence.

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:31.180
So you could have Hamiltonians
that are time dependent,

00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:33.870
but still have a
simplifying virtue.

00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:40.290
So H of t is time dependent.

00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:54.655
But assume that H at t1 and h
at t2 commute for all t1 and t2.

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:00.140
So what could that be?

00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:03.890
For example, you know that the
particle in a magnetic field,

00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:15.435
the spin in a magnetic field
is minus gamma B dot the spin.

00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:24.970
And you could have a time
dependent magnetic field, B

00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:28.380
of t times the spin.

00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:30.680
I'm not sure this is the
constant gamma that they

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:35.570
usually call gamma,
but it may be.

00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:41.500
Now then if the magnetic field
is time dependent, but imagine

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:46.350
its direction is
not time dependent.

00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:51.690
So if its direction is not time
dependent, then, for example,

00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:59.450
you would have here minus
gamma Bz of t times Sz.

00:13:59.450 --> 00:14:02.250
And the Hamiltonian at
different times commute

00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:06.260
because Sz commutes with itself,
and the fact that it's time

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:12.770
independent doesn't
make it fail to commute.

00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:17.900
So if you have a magnetic field
that is fixed in one direction

00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:21.330
but change in time, you
can have a situation where

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:24.370
your Hamiltonian
is time dependent,

00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:26.970
but still at different
times it commutes.

00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:30.640
And you will discuss such
case because it's interesting.

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:34.290
But later on as we do
nuclear magnetic resonance,

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:36.550
we will have the
more interesting case

00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:41.400
in which a magnetic field
rotates and therefore it's

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:43.900
not that simple.

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:49.540
So what happens if you have a
time dependent Hamiltonian that

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:51.560
actually commutes?

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:56.780
Well, the claim
is that U of t t0

00:14:56.780 --> 00:15:02.660
is given by a natural extension
of what we had before.

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:08.000
You would want to put
exponential of minus iHt,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.880
but the reason this worked
was because the derivative

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:15.880
with respect to time brought
down an iH over h bar.

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:24.140
So one way to fix this is to
put t t0 H of t prime dt prime.

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:34.635
So this is an
answer to try this.

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:40.630
Look at this.

00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:44.810
If the Hamiltonian were
to be time independent,

00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:46.520
you could take it out.

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:48.480
And then you would
get t minus t0.

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:53.390
That brings you back to this
case, so this looks reasonable.

00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:58.280
So let me call this
quantity R of t.

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:05.660
And then you notice
that R dot of t,

00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:10.050
the derivative of this
quantity with respect to time.

00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:14.090
Well, when you differentiate
an integral the upper argument,

00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:16.460
you get just the
integrand evaluated

00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:21.350
at the time represented
by the upper argument

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:24.140
of the upper limit
of integration.

00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:26.645
So this is H of t.

00:16:29.610 --> 00:16:36.370
And now here comes
a crucial point.

00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:38.900
You're trying to differentiate.

00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:43.580
This U is really e
to the R. And you're

00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:49.910
trying to differentiate to see
if the equation holds dU dt.

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:51.480
So what is the dU dt?

00:16:55.960 --> 00:17:05.897
Would be d dt of 1 plus R
plus RR plus 1 3 factor RRR.

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:15.520
And now what happens?

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:23.280
You differentiate here, and
the first term is R dot.

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:29.520
Here You, would have one
half R dot R plus R R dot.

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:39.480
And then 1 over 3 factorial,
but three factors.

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:46.910
R dot RR plus R R
dot R plus RR R dot.

00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:58.720
But here is the
claim R dot commutes

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:09.050
with R. Claim R
dot and R commute.

00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:10.470
Why is that?

00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:16.320
Well, R dot depends on
H. And R is an integral

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:19.850
of H as well, but the H
at different times commute

00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:22.610
anyway, so this must be true.

00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:25.250
There's no place where you
can get a contribution,

00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:30.100
because R dot is like an H,
and here's an integral of H.

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:34.270
So since the Hamiltonians
are assumed to commute,

00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:38.470
R dot commutes with
R. And this becomes

00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:41.820
like a normal derivative of
an exponential in which you

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:45.840
can move the R dot to
the left everywhere.

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:48.270
And you're differentiating
the usual thing.

00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:59.240
So this is R dot and times
the exponential of R.

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:01.800
So actually that
means that we've

00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:07.010
got pretty much our answer,
because R dot is minus

00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:11.300
i over h bar H of t.

00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:17.810
And e to the R is U,
so we got dU dt equals

00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:21.330
this, which is the
same as this equation.

00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:39.140
The only reason a derivative
with respect to time will not

00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:45.880
give the usual thing is if
R and R dot fail to commute,

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:46.790
and they don't.

00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:48.810
So you could put the R dot here.

00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:50.840
You can put R dot
on the other side,

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:54.660
because it commutes with
R, but it's better here.

00:19:54.660 --> 00:20:01.800
And therefore you've got
this very nice solution.

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:04.650
So the solution is not that bad.

00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:09.790
Now finally, I want to discuss
for a second the general case.

00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:20.806
So that's case-- there was a
1, a 2, a 3 H of t general.

00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:25.270
What can you do?

00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:28.570
Well, if H of t is
general, there's

00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:31.560
not too much you can do.

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:34.350
You can write
something that will

00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:38.570
get you started doing
things, but it's not

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:42.310
obviously terribly useful.

00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:45.060
But it's interesting
anyway that there's

00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:47.530
a way to write something
that makes sense.

00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:50.830
So here it is.

00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:52.450
U of t and t0.

00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:58.230
I'll write the answer
and explain how it looks,

00:20:58.230 --> 00:21:04.090
and then you will
see that it's OK.

00:21:04.090 --> 00:21:05.200
It's interesting.

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:08.710
But it probably is not
the most practical way

00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:09.895
you can solve this problem.

00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:16.790
So here it is.

00:21:16.790 --> 00:21:19.680
There's an acronym
for this thing.

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:23.900
T it's called the time
ordered exponential.

00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:27.750
This operator does something
to the exponential function.

00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:29.470
So it's a definition.

00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:31.350
So I have to say what
this time ordered

00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:37.830
exponential is, and
it's the following.

00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:40.970
You take the exponential
and just begin to expand.

00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:45.217
So 1 minus i over
h bar-- or I'll

00:21:45.217 --> 00:21:51.790
put like this, plus minus
i over h bar integral

00:21:51.790 --> 00:22:01.360
from t0 to t of dt1 H of t1.

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:03.130
So far, so good.

00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:07.270
I've just expanded this.

00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:10.960
Now if I would
continue expanding,

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:15.460
I would get something that
doesn't provide the solution.

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:20.110
You see, this thing
is the solution

00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:23.580
when the Hamiltonian at
different times commute.

00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:26.910
So it's unlikely to
be the solution when

00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:28.000
they don't commute.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.610
In fact, it's not the solution.

00:22:29.610 --> 00:22:32.730
So what is the next term here?

00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:36.390
The next term is you
think of the exponential

00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:38.180
as you would expand as usual.

00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:43.010
So you will have here plus one
half of this thing squared.

00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:48.320
So I will put something and then
erase it, so maybe don't copy.

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:53.370
One half minus i
over h bar squared.

00:22:53.370 --> 00:23:02.700
And you would say, well, t0
to t dt prime H of t prime.

00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:10.680
t0 to t dt double prime
H of double prime.

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:13.010
Well, that would be
just an exponential.

00:23:13.010 --> 00:23:16.620
So what is a time
ordered exponential?

00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:18.480
You erase the one half.

00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:26.885
And then for notation
call this t1 and t1.

00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:37.210
And then the next integral
do it only up to time t1,

00:23:37.210 --> 00:23:38.375
and call this t2.

00:23:44.370 --> 00:23:49.670
So t1 will always
be greater than t2,

00:23:49.670 --> 00:23:53.760
because t2 is integrated
from t0 to t1.

00:23:53.760 --> 00:24:00.410
And as you integrate here over
the various t1's, you just

00:24:00.410 --> 00:24:03.740
integrate up to that value.

00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:06.580
So you're doing less
of the full integral

00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:08.210
then you should be
doing, and that's

00:24:08.210 --> 00:24:12.080
why the factor of one
half has disappeared.

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:14.350
This can be continued.

00:24:14.350 --> 00:24:19.330
I can write the next one would
be minus i over h bar cubed

00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:33.080
integral t0 to t H of t1
integral t0 to t1 dt2 H of t2.

00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:36.370
And then they next
integral goes up to t2.

00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:41.315
So t0 to t2 dt3 H of t3.

00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:50.190
Anyway, that's a time
ordered exponential.

00:24:50.190 --> 00:24:58.970
And I leave it to you to
take the time derivative,

00:24:58.970 --> 00:25:02.660
at least to see that the first
few terms are working exactly

00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:04.550
the way they should.

00:25:04.550 --> 00:25:07.940
That is, if you take a
time derivative of this,

00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:12.710
you will get H times that thing.

00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:14.670
So since it's a
power series, you

00:25:14.670 --> 00:25:16.950
will differentiate
the first term,

00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:18.680
and you will get
the right thing.

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:22.710
Then the second term and you
will start getting everything

00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:25.310
that you need.

00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:27.770
So it's a funny object.

00:25:27.770 --> 00:25:30.950
It's reassuring that
something like this success,

00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:33.150
but in general, you
would want to be

00:25:33.150 --> 00:25:37.560
able to do all these
integrals and to sum them up.

00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:41.420
And in general,
it's not that easy.

00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:45.370
So it's of limited usefulness.

00:25:45.370 --> 00:25:47.670
It's a nice thing
that you can write it,

00:25:47.670 --> 00:25:52.570
and you can prove things
about it and manipulate it.

00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:54.750
But when you have a
practical problem,

00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:57.820
generally that's not
the way you solve it.

00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:01.920
In fact, when we will discuss
the rotating magnetic fields

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:06.680
for magnetic resonance, we
will not solve it in this way.

00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:10.870
We will try to figure out
the solution some other way.

00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:13.290
But in terms of
completeness, it's

00:26:13.290 --> 00:26:16.150
kind of pretty in
that you go from

00:26:16.150 --> 00:26:19.230
the exponential to the
time ordered exponential.

00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:24.080
And I think you'll see
more of this in 806.

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:29.100
So that's basically
our solution for H

00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:35.200
and for the unitary
operator U in terms of H.

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:36.810
And what we're
going to do now is

00:26:36.810 --> 00:26:39.170
turn to the Heisenberg
picture of quantum mechanics.

00:26:39.170 --> 00:26:40.300
Yes, questions?

00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:42.176
AUDIENCE: Why does
R dot [INAUDIBLE]?

00:26:47.210 --> 00:26:53.090
PROFESSOR: Because that's
really a property of integrals.

00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:59.180
d dx integral up
to x from x0 g of x

00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:07.360
prime dx prime is
just equal to g of x.

00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:09.570
This is a constant
here, so you're not

00:27:09.570 --> 00:27:12.310
varying the integral
over in this limit.

00:27:12.310 --> 00:27:16.170
So if this limit would
also be x dependent,

00:27:16.170 --> 00:27:17.830
you would get
another contribution,

00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:20.290
but we only get the
contribution from here.

00:27:20.290 --> 00:27:22.640
What's really happening
is you're integrating up

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:25.740
to x, then up to x plus
epsilon subtracting,

00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:30.810
so you pick up the value of the
function of the upper limit.

00:27:30.810 --> 00:27:31.800
Yes?

00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:35.740
AUDIENCE: So what happens to
the T that was pre factor?

00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:37.452
PROFESSOR: What
happens to this T?

00:27:37.452 --> 00:27:38.660
AUDIENCE: Yeah, what happens?

00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:40.830
PROFESSOR: That's just a symbol.

00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:45.280
It says time order the
following exponential.

00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:49.370
So at this stage,
this is a definition

00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:52.670
of what t on an
exponential means.

00:27:52.670 --> 00:27:54.140
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:57.260
PROFESSOR: It's not--
let me say T is not

00:27:57.260 --> 00:28:00.290
an operator in the usual
sense of quantum mechanics

00:28:00.290 --> 00:28:01.490
or anything like that.

00:28:01.490 --> 00:28:03.680
It's an instruction.

00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:07.560
Whenever you have an
exponential of this form,

00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:10.380
the time ordered
exponential is this series

00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:13.050
that we've written down.

00:28:13.050 --> 00:28:14.250
It's just a definition.

00:28:14.250 --> 00:28:14.926
Yes?

00:28:14.926 --> 00:28:17.050
AUDIENCE: So when we have
operators in differential

00:28:17.050 --> 00:28:20.850
equations, do we
still get [INAUDIBLE]?

00:28:20.850 --> 00:28:22.600
PROFESSOR: If we have what?

00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:24.933
AUDIENCE: If we have operators
in differential equations

00:28:24.933 --> 00:28:27.500
do we still get unique
[INAUDIBLE] solutions?

00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:29.680
PROFESSOR: Yes, pretty much.

00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:32.930
Because at the end
of the day, this

00:28:32.930 --> 00:28:37.940
is a first order matrix
differential equation.

00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:41.730
So it's a collection of first
order differential equations

00:28:41.730 --> 00:28:43.445
for every element of a matrix.

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:51.760
It's pretty much the
same as you have before.

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:57.440
If you know the operator
at any time, initial time,

00:28:57.440 --> 00:28:59.980
with the differential
equation you know the operator

00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:01.510
at a little bit time later.

00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:04.460
So the operator is
completely determined

00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:07.280
if you know it initially and
the differential equation.

00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:09.930
So I think it's
completely analogous.

00:29:09.930 --> 00:29:13.890
It's just that it's
harder to solve.

00:29:13.890 --> 00:29:15.150
Nothing else.

00:29:15.150 --> 00:29:16.556
One last question.

00:29:16.556 --> 00:29:18.306
AUDIENCE: So let's say
that we can somehow

00:29:18.306 --> 00:29:21.620
fly in this unitary operator,
and then we have a differential

00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:23.859
equation, and we
somehow, let's say, get

00:29:23.859 --> 00:29:27.400
a wave function out of it.

00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:30.140
What is the interpretation
of that wave function?

00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:31.515
PROFESSOR: Well,
it's not that we

00:29:31.515 --> 00:29:34.040
get the wave
function out of this.

00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:38.300
What really is
happening is that you

00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:45.020
have learned how to calculate
this operator given H.

00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:49.330
And therefore now you're able
to evolve any wave function.

00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:51.940
So you have solved
the dynamical system.

00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:55.690
If somebody tells you a time
equals 0, your system is here,

00:29:55.690 --> 00:29:59.270
you can now calculate where it's
going to be at the later time.

00:29:59.270 --> 00:30:01.200
So that's really all
you have achieved.

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:05.537
You now know the solution.

00:30:05.537 --> 00:30:07.370
When you're doing
mechanics and they ask you

00:30:07.370 --> 00:30:10.060
for an orbit problem,
they say at this time

00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:11.130
the planet is here.

00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:12.980
What are you supposed to find?

00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:14.830
x is a function of time.

00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:16.910
You now know how it's
going to develop.

00:30:16.910 --> 00:30:19.040
You've solved
equations of motion.

00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:19.860
Here it's the same.

00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:22.020
You know the wave
function of time equals.

00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:26.490
If you know it at any time,
you've solved problem.

00:30:26.490 --> 00:30:29.650
OK, so Heisenberg picture
of quantum mechanics.

00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:38.230
Heisenberg picture.

00:30:43.050 --> 00:30:48.540
So basically the
Heisenberg picture

00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:54.210
exists thanks to the existence
of the Schrodinger picture.

00:30:54.210 --> 00:30:56.240
Heisenberg picture
of quantum mechanics

00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:58.690
is not something
that you necessarily

00:30:58.690 --> 00:31:00.380
invent from the beginning.

00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:05.190
The way we think of it is we
assume there is a Schrodinger

00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:10.020
picture that we've developed in
which we have operators like x,

00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:14.790
p, spin, Hamiltonians,
and wave functions.

00:31:14.790 --> 00:31:19.020
And then we are going to
define a new way of thinking

00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:21.840
about this, which is
called the Heisenberg

00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:24.040
picture of the
quantum mechanics.

00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:29.690
So it all begins by considering
a Schrodinger operator

00:31:29.690 --> 00:31:35.070
As hat, which is s
is for Schrodinger.

00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:48.700
And the motivation comes
from expectation values.

00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:51.190
Suppose you have time
dependent states,

00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:53.440
in fact, matrix elements.

00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:58.780
One time dependent state alpha
of t, one time dependent state

00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:00.640
beta of t.

00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:06.000
Two independent time
dependent states.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:17.090
So you could ask what is
the matrix element of A

00:32:17.090 --> 00:32:20.520
between these two time dependent
states, a matrix element.

00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:31.800
But then, armed with
our unitary operator,

00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:37.980
we know that As is here, and
this state beta at time t

00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:47.190
is equal to U of t
comma 0 beta at time 0.

00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:53.390
And alpha t is equal to
alpha at 0 U dagger of t0.

00:32:56.160 --> 00:33:00.590
So the states have
time dependence.

00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:02.280
But the time
dependence has already

00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:06.850
been found, say, in principle,
if you know U dagger.

00:33:06.850 --> 00:33:13.200
And then you can speak about the
time dependent matrix elements

00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:19.510
of the operator As
or the matrix element

00:33:19.510 --> 00:33:24.960
of this time dependent
operator between the time

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:28.480
equals 0 states.

00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:31.820
And this operator is
sufficiently important

00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:35.520
that this operator is
called the Heisenberg

00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:38.760
version of the operator s.

00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:44.685
Has time dependence, and it's
defined by this equation.

00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:57.560
So whenever you have
Schrodinger operator,

00:33:57.560 --> 00:34:02.190
whether it be time dependent
or time independent,

00:34:02.190 --> 00:34:04.790
whatever the
Schrodinger operator is,

00:34:04.790 --> 00:34:07.150
I have now a
definition of what I

00:34:07.150 --> 00:34:11.409
will call the
Heisenberg operator.

00:34:11.409 --> 00:34:17.719
And it is obtained by acting
with a unitary operator, U.

00:34:17.719 --> 00:34:23.900
And operators always act
on operators from the left

00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:25.360
and from the right.

00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:30.000
That's something that operators
act on states from the left.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.850
They act on the state.

00:34:31.850 --> 00:34:35.730
But operators act on
operator from the left

00:34:35.730 --> 00:34:38.360
and from the right,
as you see them here,

00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:41.739
is the natural, ideal
thing to happen.

00:34:41.739 --> 00:34:45.510
If you have an operator that's
on another from the right only

00:34:45.510 --> 00:34:47.969
or from the left
only, I think you

00:34:47.969 --> 00:34:50.270
have grounds to be
suspicious that maybe you're

00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:53.000
not doing things right.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.440
So this is the
Heisenberg operator.

00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:57.360
And as you can
imagine, there's a lot

00:34:57.360 --> 00:35:01.090
of things to be said
about this operator.

00:35:01.090 --> 00:35:03.060
So let's begin with a remark.

00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:07.970
Are there questions about
this Heisenberg operator.

00:35:07.970 --> 00:35:08.700
Yes?

00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:12.180
AUDIENCE: Do we know anything
about the Schrodinger operator?

00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:13.680
PROFESSOR: You have
to speak louder.

00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:15.221
AUDIENCE: Is the
Schrodinger operator

00:35:15.221 --> 00:35:17.850
related to the
Hamiltonian [INAUDIBLE]?

00:35:17.850 --> 00:35:19.830
PROFESSOR: Any
Schrodinger operator,

00:35:19.830 --> 00:35:22.260
this could be the
Hamiltonian, this

00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:27.550
could be x hat, it
could be Sz, could

00:35:27.550 --> 00:35:29.090
be any of the
operators you know.

00:35:29.090 --> 00:35:34.420
All the operators you know
are Schrodinger operators.

00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:38.330
So remarks, comments.

00:35:38.330 --> 00:35:39.306
OK, comments.

00:35:43.130 --> 00:35:57.730
One, at t equals 0
A Heisenberg becomes

00:35:57.730 --> 00:36:05.630
identical to A
Schrodinger at t equals 0.

00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:16.300
So look why.

00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:22.260
Because when t is equal to 0,
U of t-- of 0 0 is the operator

00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:26.020
propagates no state, so
it's equal to the identity.

00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:28.980
So this is a wonderful
relation that

00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:34.220
tell us you that time equals
0 the two operators are really

00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:36.190
the same.

00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:38.880
And another simple remark.

00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:44.440
If you have the unit operator
in the Schrodinger picture,

00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:49.210
what is the unit operator
in the Heisenberg picture?

00:36:49.210 --> 00:37:00.790
Well, it would be U
t 0 dagger 1 U t 0.

00:37:00.790 --> 00:37:03.300
But 1 doesn't matter.

00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:05.890
U dagger with U is 1.

00:37:05.890 --> 00:37:09.460
This is a 1 Schrodinger,
and therefore it's

00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:11.300
the same operator.

00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:16.170
So the unit operator
is the same.

00:37:16.170 --> 00:37:20.300
It just doesn't
change whatsoever.

00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:23.080
OK, so that's good.

00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:26.470
But now this is something
interesting also happens.

00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:31.380
Suppose you have
Schrodinger operator

00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:37.526
C that is equal to the product
of A with B, two Schrodingers.

00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:47.460
If I try to figure
out what is CH,

00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:53.640
I would put U dagger-- avoid
all the letters, the t 0.

00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:55.750
It's supposed to be t 0.

00:37:55.750 --> 00:38:07.520
Cs U. But that's equal
U dagger As Bs U.

00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:10.270
But now, in between
the two operators,

00:38:10.270 --> 00:38:14.980
you can put a U U dagger,
which is equal to 1.

00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:23.670
So As U U dagger
Bs U. And then you

00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:26.780
see why this is really nice.

00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:31.890
Because what do you get is
that C Heisenberg is just

00:38:31.890 --> 00:38:34.650
A Heisenberg times B Heisenberg.

00:38:34.650 --> 00:38:38.882
So if you have C Schrodinger
equals A Schrodinger, B

00:38:38.882 --> 00:38:45.330
Schrodinger, C Heisenberg is
A Heisenberg B Heisenberg.

00:38:45.330 --> 00:38:49.260
So there's a nice correspondence
between those operators.

00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:58.670
Also you can do is
for commutators.

00:38:58.670 --> 00:39:02.350
So you don't have to
worry about this thing.

00:39:02.350 --> 00:39:13.500
So for example, if A
Schrodinger with B Schrodinger

00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:19.380
is equal to C Schrodinger,
then by doing exactly

00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:27.760
the same things, you see that
A Heisenberg with B Heisenberg

00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:31.400
would be the commutator
equal to C Heisenberg.

00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:35.670
Yes?

00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:38.828
AUDIENCE: That argument
for the identity operators

00:39:38.828 --> 00:39:41.120
being the same in both pictures.

00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:43.970
If the Hamiltonian
is time independent,

00:39:43.970 --> 00:39:46.470
does that work for any
operator that commutes

00:39:46.470 --> 00:39:48.727
with the Hamiltonian?

00:39:48.727 --> 00:39:50.310
PROFESSOR: Hamiltonian
is [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:56.070 --> 00:39:58.280
AUDIENCE: Because then you
can push the operator just

00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:00.850
through the exponential
of the Hamiltonian.

00:40:00.850 --> 00:40:05.010
PROFESSOR: Yeah, we'll
see things like that.

00:40:05.010 --> 00:40:08.430
We could discuss that
maybe a little later.

00:40:08.430 --> 00:40:11.950
But there are some cases,
as we will see immediately,

00:40:11.950 --> 00:40:16.650
in which some operators are
the same in the two pictures.

00:40:16.650 --> 00:40:20.700
So basically operators that
commute with the Hamiltonian

00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:26.320
as you say, since U
involves the Hamiltonian,

00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:28.790
and this is the
Hamiltonian, if the operator

00:40:28.790 --> 00:40:31.310
commutes with the Hamiltonian
and you can move them across,

00:40:31.310 --> 00:40:32.268
then they are the same.

00:40:32.268 --> 00:40:35.880
So I think it's definitely true.

00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:40.640
So we will have an
interesting question,

00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:43.450
in fact, whether the
Heisenberg Hamiltonian is

00:40:43.450 --> 00:40:45.070
equal to the
Schrodinger Hamiltonian,

00:40:45.070 --> 00:40:48.290
and we'll answer that very soon.

00:40:48.290 --> 00:40:52.720
So the one example that here I
think you should keep in mind

00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:54.860
is this one.

00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:56.900
You know this is true.

00:40:56.900 --> 00:41:00.730
So what do you knowing
the Heisenberg picture?

00:41:00.730 --> 00:41:08.150
That X Heisenberg of t times
P Heisenberg of t commutator

00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:12.210
is equal to the Heisenberg
version of this.

00:41:12.210 --> 00:41:15.000
But here was the unit operator.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:20.510
And therefore this is just ih
bar times the unit operator

00:41:20.510 --> 00:41:22.790
again, because
the units operator

00:41:22.790 --> 00:41:25.900
is the same in all pictures.

00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:31.840
So these commutation relation
is true for any Heisenberg

00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:33.950
operator.

00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:37.100
Whatever commutation relation
you have of Schrodinger,

00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:38.990
it's true for
Heisenberg as well.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:46.670
OK, so then let's talk
about Hamiltonians.

00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:53.180
Three, Hamiltonians.

00:41:53.180 --> 00:42:00.160
So Heisenberg
Hamiltonian by definition

00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:07.890
would be equal to U dagger
t 0 Schrodinger Hamiltonian

00:42:07.890 --> 00:42:09.980
times U of t 0.

00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:18.100
So if the Schrodinger
Hamiltonian-- actually,

00:42:18.100 --> 00:42:25.490
if Hs at t1 commutes
units with Hs at t2,

00:42:25.490 --> 00:42:31.270
the Schrodinger Hamiltonian
is such that for all t1 and t2

00:42:31.270 --> 00:42:34.890
they commute with each other.

00:42:34.890 --> 00:42:38.560
Remember, if that is the
case, the unitary operator

00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:42.790
is any way built
by an exponential.

00:42:42.790 --> 00:42:43.880
It's this one.

00:42:47.590 --> 00:42:51.010
And the Schrodinger
Hamiltonians commute.

00:42:51.010 --> 00:42:53.770
So as was asked in
the question before,

00:42:53.770 --> 00:42:57.700
this thing commutes
with that, and you

00:42:57.700 --> 00:43:00.180
get that they are the same.

00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:05.730
So if this is happening, the
two Hamiltonians are identical.

00:43:12.030 --> 00:43:17.110
And we'll have the
chance to check

00:43:17.110 --> 00:43:21.220
this today in a nice example.

00:43:21.220 --> 00:43:29.230
So I will write in this
as saying the Heisenberg

00:43:29.230 --> 00:43:31.550
Hamiltonian as a
function of time

00:43:31.550 --> 00:43:34.580
then is equal to the
Schrodinger Hamiltonian

00:43:34.580 --> 00:43:37.160
as a function of time.

00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:45.160
And this goes Hs of t1
and Hs of t2 commute.

00:43:48.130 --> 00:43:55.990
OK, now I want you
to notice this thing.

00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:15.260
Suppose the Hs of t is some
Hs of x,p, and t, for example.

00:44:15.260 --> 00:44:21.150
OK, now you come and
turn it into Heisenberg

00:44:21.150 --> 00:44:26.930
by putting a U dagger from the
left and a U from the right.

00:44:26.930 --> 00:44:29.560
What will that do?

00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:32.360
It will put U dagger from the
left, U dagger on the right.

00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:36.750
And then it will start
working it's way inside,

00:44:36.750 --> 00:44:41.990
and any x that it will find
will turn into a Heisenberg x.

00:44:41.990 --> 00:44:44.690
Any p will turn
into Heisenberg p.

00:44:44.690 --> 00:44:47.160
Imagine, for example,
any Hamiltonian

00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:49.630
is some function of x.

00:44:49.630 --> 00:44:51.090
It has an x squared.

00:44:51.090 --> 00:44:53.970
Well the U dagger
and U come and turn

00:44:53.970 --> 00:44:57.390
this into x Heisenberg squared.

00:44:57.390 --> 00:45:05.720
So what I claim here happens
is that H Heisenberg of t

00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:15.540
is equal to U dagger H
Schrodinger of x, p, t, U.

00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:22.770
And therefore this
becomes H Schrodinger of x

00:45:22.770 --> 00:45:29.260
Heisenberg of t, P
Heisenberg of t, and t.

00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:41.550
So here is what the
Heisenberg Hamiltonian is.

00:45:41.550 --> 00:45:46.040
It's the Schrodinger Hamiltonian
where X's, and P's, or spins

00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:49.700
and everything has
become Heisenberg.

00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:53.300
So the equality of
the two Hamiltonians

00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:58.110
is a very funny condition on
the Schrodinger Hamiltonian,

00:45:58.110 --> 00:46:02.010
because this is supposed to
be equal to the Schrodinger

00:46:02.010 --> 00:46:05.900
Hamiltonian, which
is of x, p, and t.

00:46:11.710 --> 00:46:16.420
So you have a function
of x, p, and t.

00:46:16.420 --> 00:46:19.430
And you put X
Heisenberg P Heisenberg,

00:46:19.430 --> 00:46:22.040
and somehow the whole
thing is the same.

00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:34.470
So this is something very
useful and we'll need it.

00:46:34.470 --> 00:46:38.170
One more comment,
expectation values.

00:46:38.170 --> 00:46:41.300
So this is three.

00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:47.400
Comment number four on
expectation values, which

00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:51.220
is something you've already--
it's sort of the way

00:46:51.220 --> 00:46:57.770
we began the discussion and
wanted to make sure it's clear.

00:46:57.770 --> 00:47:02.032
So four, expectation values.

00:47:05.430 --> 00:47:09.670
So we started with this
with alpha and beta,

00:47:09.670 --> 00:47:12.610
two arbitrary states,
matrix elements.

00:47:12.610 --> 00:47:17.170
Take them equal and to
be equal to psi of t.

00:47:17.170 --> 00:47:26.120
So you would have psi
t As psi t is, in fact,

00:47:26.120 --> 00:47:39.080
equal to psi 0 A
Heisenberg psi 0.

00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:43.790
Now that is a key equation.

00:47:43.790 --> 00:47:47.920
You know you're doing
expectation value at any given

00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:52.640
time of a Schrodinger operator,
turn it into Heisenberg

00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:55.320
and work at time equals 0.

00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:58.170
It simplifies life tremendously.

00:47:58.170 --> 00:48:00.370
Now this is the key identity.

00:48:00.370 --> 00:48:03.810
It's the way we motivated
everything in a way.

00:48:03.810 --> 00:48:08.180
And it's written in
a way that maybe it's

00:48:08.180 --> 00:48:14.460
a little too schematic,
but we write it this way.

00:48:14.460 --> 00:48:16.620
We just say the
expectation value

00:48:16.620 --> 00:48:23.640
of As is equal to the
expectation value of AH.

00:48:28.140 --> 00:48:31.660
And this, well, we
save time like that,

00:48:31.660 --> 00:48:33.770
but you have to
know what you mean.

00:48:33.770 --> 00:48:36.290
When you're computing
the expectation

00:48:36.290 --> 00:48:37.980
value for a
Schrodinger operator,

00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:40.464
you're using time
dependent states.

00:48:40.464 --> 00:48:42.005
When you're computing
the expectation

00:48:42.005 --> 00:48:44.590
value of the
Heisenberg operator,

00:48:44.590 --> 00:48:48.360
you're using the time equals
0 version of the states,

00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:49.680
but they are the same.

00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:53.530
So we say that the
Schrodinger expectation value

00:48:53.530 --> 00:48:55.680
is equal to the Heisenberg
expectation value.

00:48:55.680 --> 00:49:01.760
We right it in the bottom,
but we mean the top equation.

00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:06.140
And we use it that way.

00:49:06.140 --> 00:49:12.320
So the Heisenberg
operators, at this moment,

00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:14.640
are a little mysterious.

00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:18.920
They're supposed to be
given by this formula,

00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:22.940
but we've seen that
calculating U can be difficult.

00:49:22.940 --> 00:49:25.860
So calculating the
Heisenberg operator

00:49:25.860 --> 00:49:28.010
can be difficult sometimes.

00:49:28.010 --> 00:49:31.740
So what we try to do
in order to simplify

00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:35.950
that is find an equation that
is satisfied by the Heisenberg

00:49:35.950 --> 00:49:40.270
operator, a time
derivative equation.

00:49:40.270 --> 00:49:43.170
So let's try to find
an equation that

00:49:43.170 --> 00:49:47.830
is satisfied by the Heisenberg
operator rather than a formula.

00:49:47.830 --> 00:49:50.150
You'll say, well,
this is better.

00:49:50.150 --> 00:49:54.996
But the fact is that seldom you
know U. And even if you know U,

00:49:54.996 --> 00:49:59.010
you have to do this
simplification, which is hard.

00:49:59.010 --> 00:50:03.080
So finding a differential
equation for the operator

00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:04.090
is useful.

00:50:04.090 --> 00:50:11.300
So differential equation
for Heisenberg operators.

00:50:14.730 --> 00:50:16.300
So what do we want to do?

00:50:16.300 --> 00:50:28.775
We want to calculate ih bar d
dt of the Heisenberg operator.

00:50:32.670 --> 00:50:35.710
And so what do we get?

00:50:35.710 --> 00:50:40.160
Well, we have several things.

00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:42.050
Remember, the
Schrodinger operator

00:50:42.050 --> 00:50:45.160
can have a bit of
time dependence.

00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:48.220
The time dependence would be
an explicit time dependence.

00:50:48.220 --> 00:50:51.360
So let's take the time
derivative of all this.

00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:53.680
So you would have three terms.

00:50:53.680 --> 00:51:06.670
ih bar dU dagger dt
As U plus U dagger

00:51:06.670 --> 00:51:21.455
As dU dt plus-- with an ih bar--
U dagger ih bar dAs minus dt.

00:51:26.050 --> 00:51:40.670
dAs dt and U.

00:51:40.670 --> 00:51:44.060
Well, you have these equations.

00:51:44.060 --> 00:51:45.910
Those were the
Schrodinger equations

00:51:45.910 --> 00:51:49.100
we started with today.

00:51:49.100 --> 00:51:53.600
The derivatives of U, or
the derivatives of U dagger.

00:51:53.600 --> 00:51:56.790
so what did we have?

00:51:56.790 --> 00:52:11.800
Well, we have that ih bar dU dt
was HU-- H Schrodinger times U.

00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:20.160
And therefore ih
bar dU dagger dt.

00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:21.770
I take the dagger of this.

00:52:21.770 --> 00:52:23.510
I would get a minus sign.

00:52:23.510 --> 00:52:25.290
I would put it on
the other side.

00:52:25.290 --> 00:52:32.310
Is equal to U dagger
Hs with a minus here.

00:52:32.310 --> 00:52:37.020
And all the U's are
U's of t and t0.

00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:41.900
I ran out of this thick chalk.

00:52:41.900 --> 00:52:43.890
So we'll continue
with thin chalk.

00:52:46.500 --> 00:52:48.050
All right, so we are here.

00:52:51.890 --> 00:52:54.290
We wrote the time
derivative, and we

00:52:54.290 --> 00:52:58.870
have three terms to work out.

00:52:58.870 --> 00:53:00.450
So what are they?

00:53:00.450 --> 00:53:04.000
Well we have this
thing, ih bar this.

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:16.060
So let's write it. ih bar d
d dt of As-- of A Heisenberg,

00:53:16.060 --> 00:53:27.310
I'm sorry-- Is equal to that
term is minus U dagger Hs A

00:53:27.310 --> 00:53:31.830
Schrodinger U.

00:53:31.830 --> 00:53:37.940
The next term plus ih
bar dU dt on the right.

00:53:37.940 --> 00:53:55.840
So we have plus U dagger
As Hs dU dt, so U. Well,

00:53:55.840 --> 00:53:57.020
that's not bad.

00:53:57.020 --> 00:53:59.250
It's actually quite nice.

00:53:59.250 --> 00:54:03.830
And then the last term, which
I have very little to say,

00:54:03.830 --> 00:54:08.600
because in general, this
is a derivative of a time

00:54:08.600 --> 00:54:11.370
dependent operator.

00:54:11.370 --> 00:54:16.470
Partial with respect to time,
it would be 0 if As depends,

00:54:16.470 --> 00:54:21.160
just say, on X, on P, on
Sx, or any of those things,

00:54:21.160 --> 00:54:23.320
has to have a particular t.

00:54:23.320 --> 00:54:36.800
So I will just leave this as
plus ih bar dAs dt Heisenberg.

00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:40.760
The Heisenberg version
of this operator using

00:54:40.760 --> 00:54:44.790
the definition that anything,
any operator that we have

00:54:44.790 --> 00:54:47.880
a U dagger in front,
a U to the right,

00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:52.620
is the Heisenberg
version of the operator.

00:54:52.620 --> 00:54:58.460
So I think I'm doing all
right with this equation.

00:54:58.460 --> 00:55:00.850
So what did we have?

00:55:00.850 --> 00:55:08.230
Here it is. ih bar d dt
of A Heisenberg of t.

00:55:08.230 --> 00:55:14.850
And now comes the
nice thing, of course.

00:55:14.850 --> 00:55:16.670
This thing, look at it.

00:55:16.670 --> 00:55:21.150
U dagger U. This
turns everything here

00:55:21.150 --> 00:55:22.460
into Heisenberg.

00:55:22.460 --> 00:55:25.170
H Heisenberg, A Heisenberg.

00:55:25.170 --> 00:55:30.160
Here you have A Heisenberg H
Heisenberg, and what you got

00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:32.590
is the commutator between them.

00:55:32.590 --> 00:55:39.000
So this thing is A Heisenberg
commutator with H Heisenberg.

00:55:45.070 --> 00:55:46.330
That whole thing.

00:55:46.330 --> 00:55:54.215
And then you have plus
ih bar dAs dt Heisenberg.

00:56:00.320 --> 00:56:05.280
So that is the Heisenberg
equation of motion.

00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:11.640
That is how you can calculate
a Heisenberg operator

00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:12.290
if you want.

00:56:14.950 --> 00:56:18.020
You tried to solve this
differential equation,

00:56:18.020 --> 00:56:20.060
and many times
that's the simplest

00:56:20.060 --> 00:56:23.320
way to calculate the
Heisenberg operator.

00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:25.840
So there you go.

00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:28.400
It's a pretty
important equation.

00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:34.390
So let's consider
particular cases immediately

00:56:34.390 --> 00:56:36.560
to just get some intuition.

00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:40.175
So remarks.

00:56:43.450 --> 00:56:55.700
Suppose As has no
explicit time dependence.

00:56:55.700 --> 00:56:58.765
So basically, there's
no explicit t,

00:56:58.765 --> 00:57:02.310
and therefore this
derivative goes away.

00:57:02.310 --> 00:57:11.090
So the equation becomes
ih bar dAh, of course,

00:57:11.090 --> 00:57:21.406
dt is equal to Ah
Heisenberg sub h of t.

00:57:21.406 --> 00:57:24.150
And you know the
Heisenberg operator

00:57:24.150 --> 00:57:27.110
is supposed to be simpler.

00:57:27.110 --> 00:57:27.850
Simple.

00:57:27.850 --> 00:57:30.730
If the Schrodinger operator
is time independent,

00:57:30.730 --> 00:57:34.810
it's identical to the
Schrodinger Hamiltonian.

00:57:34.810 --> 00:57:39.020
Even if the Schrodinger
operator has time dependence,

00:57:39.020 --> 00:57:43.620
but they commute, this
will become the Schrodinger

00:57:43.620 --> 00:57:44.470
Hamiltonian.

00:57:44.470 --> 00:57:46.040
But we can leave it like that.

00:57:46.040 --> 00:57:50.870
It's a nice thing anyway.

00:57:50.870 --> 00:57:53.470
Time dependence of
expectation value.

00:57:53.470 --> 00:57:59.841
So let me do a little remark on
time dependence of expectation

00:57:59.841 --> 00:58:00.340
values.

00:58:00.340 --> 00:58:05.310
So suppose you have the usual
thing that you want to compute.

00:58:05.310 --> 00:58:11.620
How does the expectation value
of a Schrodinger operator

00:58:11.620 --> 00:58:12.880
depend on time?

00:58:15.590 --> 00:58:20.050
You're faced with that
expectation value of As,

00:58:20.050 --> 00:58:22.670
and it changes in
time, and you want

00:58:22.670 --> 00:58:24.530
to know how you
can compute that.

00:58:24.530 --> 00:58:30.100
Well, you first say,
OK, ih bar d dt.

00:58:30.100 --> 00:58:41.960
But this thing is nothing but
psi 0 A Heisenberg of t psi 0.

00:58:41.960 --> 00:58:46.230
Now I can let the
derivative go in.

00:58:46.230 --> 00:58:59.690
So this becomes psi 0
ih bar dAh dt psi 0.

00:58:59.690 --> 00:59:09.335
And using this, assuming that
A is still no time dependence,

00:59:09.335 --> 00:59:18.700
A has no explicit
time dependence,

00:59:18.700 --> 00:59:21.910
then you can use
just this equation,

00:59:21.910 --> 00:59:31.935
which give you
psi 0 Ah Hh psi 0.

00:59:34.940 --> 00:59:38.760
So all in all, what
have you gotten?

00:59:44.840 --> 00:59:53.100
You've gotten a rather simple
thing, the time derivative

00:59:53.100 --> 00:59:54.930
of the expectation values.

00:59:54.930 --> 00:59:57.900
So ih bar d dt.

00:59:57.900 --> 01:00:00.420
And now I write
the left hand side

01:00:00.420 --> 01:00:06.780
as just expectation value
of H Heisenberg of t.

01:00:10.588 --> 01:00:15.330
And on the left hand side has
to the A Schrodinger expectation

01:00:15.330 --> 01:00:18.360
value, but we call
those expectation values

01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:22.080
the same thing as a
Heisenberg expectation value.

01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:30.350
So this thing becomes the right
hand side is the expectation

01:00:30.350 --> 01:00:37.050
value of A Heisenberg
H Heisenberg like that.

01:00:40.354 --> 01:00:47.690
And just the way we say
that Heisenberg expectation

01:00:47.690 --> 01:00:50.140
values are the same as
Schrodinger expectation values,

01:00:50.140 --> 01:00:52.760
you could as well
write, if you prefer,

01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:59.600
as d dt of A Schrodinger
is equal to the expectation

01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:02.756
value of A Schrodinger
with H Schrodinger.

01:01:06.990 --> 01:01:09.720
It's really the same equation.

01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:14.240
This equation we derived
a couple of lectures ago.

01:01:16.830 --> 01:01:19.570
And now we know that
the expectation values

01:01:19.570 --> 01:01:22.450
of Schrodinger operators are
the same as the expectation

01:01:22.450 --> 01:01:25.050
value of their
Heisenberg counterparts,

01:01:25.050 --> 01:01:28.890
except that the states are
taking up time equals 0.

01:01:28.890 --> 01:01:34.590
So you can use either
form of this equation.

01:01:34.590 --> 01:01:38.590
The bottom one is one
that you've already seen.

01:01:38.590 --> 01:01:43.340
The top one now looks almost
obvious from the bottom one,

01:01:43.340 --> 01:01:48.140
but it really took
quite a bit to get it.

01:01:48.140 --> 01:01:50.453
One last comment
on these operators.

01:01:54.850 --> 01:01:56.900
How about conserved operators?

01:01:56.900 --> 01:01:58.950
What are those things?

01:01:58.950 --> 01:02:10.440
A time independent As
is set to be conserved

01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:12.400
if it commutes with a
Schrodinger Hamiltonian.

01:02:16.390 --> 01:02:27.190
If As commutes with As equals 0.

01:02:27.190 --> 01:02:41.830
Now you know that if As with
Hs is 0, Ah with Hh is 0,

01:02:41.830 --> 01:02:45.950
because the map between
Heisenberg and Schrodinger

01:02:45.950 --> 01:02:49.650
pictures is a commutator that
is valued at the Schrodinger

01:02:49.650 --> 01:02:52.540
picture is valued in the
Heisenberg picture by putting

01:02:52.540 --> 01:02:53.650
H's.

01:02:53.650 --> 01:02:58.020
So what you realize from
this is that this thing,

01:02:58.020 --> 01:03:05.690
this implies Ah
commutes with Hh.

01:03:05.690 --> 01:03:12.260
And therefore by
point 1, by 1, you

01:03:12.260 --> 01:03:20.810
have to dAh dt is equal to 0.

01:03:20.810 --> 01:03:25.150
And this is nice, actually.

01:03:25.150 --> 01:03:32.530
The Heisenberg operator is
actually time independent.

01:03:32.530 --> 01:03:34.590
It just doesn't depend on time.

01:03:34.590 --> 01:03:39.230
So a Schrodinger operator,
it's a funny operator.

01:03:39.230 --> 01:03:41.020
It doesn't have time in there.

01:03:41.020 --> 01:03:47.790
It has X's, P's, spins, and
you don't know in general,

01:03:47.790 --> 01:03:52.530
if it's time independent
in the sense of conserve

01:03:52.530 --> 01:03:55.430
of expectation values.

01:03:55.430 --> 01:04:00.420
But whenever As
commutes with Hs,

01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:04.740
well, the expectation
values don't change in time.

01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:08.100
But as you know, this
d dt can be brought in,

01:04:08.100 --> 01:04:10.740
because the states are
not time dependent.

01:04:10.740 --> 01:04:14.420
So the fact that this
is 0 means the operator,

01:04:14.420 --> 01:04:18.810
Heisenberg operator, is
really time independent.

01:04:18.810 --> 01:04:22.710
Whenever you have a
Schrodinger operator, has no t,

01:04:22.710 --> 01:04:25.830
the Heisenberg one
can have a lot of t.

01:04:25.830 --> 01:04:29.460
But if the operator
is conserved,

01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:33.640
then the Heisenberg operator
will have no t's after all.

01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:37.260
It will really be conserved.

01:04:37.260 --> 01:04:42.640
So let's use our last 10
minutes to do an example

01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:46.140
and illustrate much of this.

01:04:46.140 --> 01:04:48.560
In the notes, there
will be three examples.

01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:51.860
I will do just one in lecture.

01:04:51.860 --> 01:04:56.580
You can do the other ones
in recitation next week.

01:04:56.580 --> 01:05:00.495
There's no need really
that you study these things

01:05:00.495 --> 01:05:01.990
at this moment.

01:05:01.990 --> 01:05:05.410
Just try to get whatever you
can now from the lecture,

01:05:05.410 --> 01:05:09.840
and next week you'll
go back to this.

01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:13.050
So the example is the
harmonic oscillator.

01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:25.130
And it will illustrate the
ideas very nicely, I think.

01:05:25.130 --> 01:05:28.420
The Schrodinger
Hamiltonian is p squared

01:05:28.420 --> 01:05:35.400
over 2m plus 1/2 m omega
squared x hat squared.

01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:41.350
OK, I could put x Schrodinger
and p Schrodinger, but that

01:05:41.350 --> 01:05:43.880
would be just far
too much. x and p

01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:46.380
are the operators
you've always known.

01:05:46.380 --> 01:05:48.470
They are Schrodinger operators.

01:05:48.470 --> 01:05:51.980
So we leave them like that.

01:05:51.980 --> 01:05:57.150
Now I have to write the
Heisenberg Hamiltonian.

01:05:57.150 --> 01:06:00.490
Well, what is the
Heisenberg Hamiltonian?

01:06:07.540 --> 01:06:08.520
yes?

01:06:08.520 --> 01:06:09.852
AUDIENCE: It's identical.

01:06:09.852 --> 01:06:10.560
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:12.140
AUDIENCE: It's identical.

01:06:12.140 --> 01:06:14.800
PROFESSOR: Identical, yes.

01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:18.280
But I will leave that
for a little later.

01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:21.670
I will just assume,
well, I'm supposed

01:06:21.670 --> 01:06:26.340
to do U dagger U.
As you said, this

01:06:26.340 --> 01:06:28.000
is a time independent
Hamiltonian.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.960
It better be the
same, but it will

01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:35.000
be clearer if we now write
what it should be in general.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.650
Have a U dagger and
a U from the right.

01:06:37.650 --> 01:06:43.550
They come here, and they turn
this into P Heisenberg over 2m

01:06:43.550 --> 01:06:47.380
plus 1/2 m omega
squared x Heisenberg.

01:06:50.300 --> 01:06:55.100
OK, that's your
Heisenberg Hamiltonian.

01:06:55.100 --> 01:06:58.660
And we will check, in fact,
that it's time independent.

01:06:58.660 --> 01:07:09.130
So how about the operators X
Heisenberg and P Heisenberg.

01:07:09.130 --> 01:07:10.810
What are they?

01:07:10.810 --> 01:07:13.040
Well, I don't know
how to get them,

01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:16.240
unless I do this
sort of U thing.

01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:22.170
That doesn't look too bad
but certainly would be messy.

01:07:22.170 --> 01:07:25.430
You would have to do
an exponential of e

01:07:25.430 --> 01:07:30.225
to the minus iHt over
t with the x operator

01:07:30.225 --> 01:07:31.990
and another exponential.

01:07:31.990 --> 01:07:34.290
Sounds a little complicated.

01:07:34.290 --> 01:07:41.150
So let's do it the way the
equations of the Heisenberg

01:07:41.150 --> 01:07:42.740
operators tell you.

01:07:42.740 --> 01:07:46.570
Well, X and P are time
independent Schrodinger

01:07:46.570 --> 01:07:49.950
operators, so that equation
that I boxed holds.

01:07:49.950 --> 01:07:57.290
So ih dx Heisenberg
dt is nothing else

01:07:57.290 --> 01:08:02.910
than X Heisenberg commuted
with H Heisenberg.

01:08:02.910 --> 01:08:05.860
OK, can we do that commutator?

01:08:05.860 --> 01:08:07.030
Yes.

01:08:07.030 --> 01:08:09.580
Because X Heisenberg,
as you remember,

01:08:09.580 --> 01:08:11.670
just commutes with P Heisenberg.

01:08:11.670 --> 01:08:15.422
So instead of the
Hamiltonian, you can put this.

01:08:15.422 --> 01:08:20.720
This is X Heisenberg P
Heisenberg squared over 2m.

01:08:27.352 --> 01:08:30.330
OK well, X Heisenberg
P Heisenberg

01:08:30.330 --> 01:08:34.240
is like you had X and P.
So what is this commutator?

01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:36.200
You probably know it by now.

01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:39.600
You act with this
and these two p.

01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:43.350
So it acts on one, acts on the
other, gives the same on each.

01:08:43.350 --> 01:08:49.100
So you get P Heisenberg times
the commutator of X and P,

01:08:49.100 --> 01:08:53.830
which is ih bar
times a factor of 2.

01:08:57.250 --> 01:09:00.760
So we could put hats.

01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:03.689
Better maybe.

01:09:03.689 --> 01:09:05.960
And then what do we get?

01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:09.069
The ih there and ih cancels.

01:09:09.069 --> 01:09:11.029
And we get some
nice equation that

01:09:11.029 --> 01:09:17.960
says dX Heisenberg dt is
1 over m P Heisenberg.

01:09:21.430 --> 01:09:23.729
Well, it actually
looks like an equation

01:09:23.729 --> 01:09:25.310
in classical mechanics.

01:09:25.310 --> 01:09:28.109
dx dt is P over m.

01:09:28.109 --> 01:09:31.529
So that's a good thing about the
Heisenberg equations of motion.

01:09:31.529 --> 01:09:34.960
They look like
ordinary equations

01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:37.890
for dynamical variables.

01:09:37.890 --> 01:09:39.560
Well, we've got this one.

01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:46.479
Let's get P. Well, we didn't
get the operator still,

01:09:46.479 --> 01:09:49.569
but we got an equation.

01:09:49.569 --> 01:09:53.100
So how about P dP dt.

01:09:53.100 --> 01:10:03.060
So ih dP Heisenberg dt would be
P Heisenberg with H Heisenberg.

01:10:03.060 --> 01:10:06.550
And this time only the
potential term in here matters.

01:10:06.550 --> 01:10:11.090
So it's P Heisenberg
with 1/2 m omega

01:10:11.090 --> 01:10:14.730
squared X Heisenberg squared.

01:10:14.730 --> 01:10:15.695
So what do we?

01:10:15.695 --> 01:10:20.340
We get 1/2 m omega squared.

01:10:20.340 --> 01:10:23.870
Then we get again a factor of 2.

01:10:23.870 --> 01:10:27.420
Then we get one left over Xh.

01:10:27.420 --> 01:10:33.310
And then a P with Xh,
which is a minus ih bar.

01:10:33.310 --> 01:10:43.302
So the ih bars cancel, and we
get dPh dt is equal to-- the h

01:10:43.302 --> 01:10:48.380
bar cancelled-- m
omega squared Xh.

01:10:48.380 --> 01:10:49.250
Minus m.

01:10:56.960 --> 01:11:01.616
All right, so these are our
Heisenberg equations of motion.

01:11:04.570 --> 01:11:08.350
So how do we solve for them now?

01:11:08.350 --> 01:11:12.570
Well, you sort of have
to try the kind of things

01:11:12.570 --> 01:11:14.690
that you would do classically.

01:11:14.690 --> 01:11:18.140
Take a second derivative
of this equation.

01:11:18.140 --> 01:11:29.430
d second Xh dt squared
would be 1 over m dPh dt.

01:11:29.430 --> 01:11:32.550
And the dPh dt
would be [INAUDIBLE]

01:11:32.550 --> 01:11:39.530
1 over m times minus
m omega squared Xh.

01:11:39.530 --> 01:11:50.710
So d second Xh dt squared is
equal to minus omega squared

01:11:50.710 --> 01:11:55.420
Xh, exactly the
equation of motion

01:11:55.420 --> 01:11:57.050
of a harmonic oscillator.

01:12:01.010 --> 01:12:05.060
It's really absolutely
nice that you

01:12:05.060 --> 01:12:09.350
recover those equations
that you had before,

01:12:09.350 --> 01:12:14.310
except that now you're
talking operators.

01:12:14.310 --> 01:12:17.970
And it's going to simplify your
life quite dramatically when

01:12:17.970 --> 01:12:23.400
you try to use these
operators, because, in a sense,

01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:28.840
solving for the time
dependent Heisenberg operators

01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:33.340
is the same as finding the
time evolution of all states.

01:12:33.340 --> 01:12:35.730
This time the operators
change, and you

01:12:35.730 --> 01:12:38.020
will know what they change like.

01:12:38.020 --> 01:12:39.500
So you have this.

01:12:39.500 --> 01:12:48.120
And then you write Xh is equal
to A cosine omega t plus B

01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:54.910
sine omega t where A
and B are some time

01:12:54.910 --> 01:12:56.560
independent operators.

01:12:56.560 --> 01:13:04.360
So Xh of t, well,
that's a solution.

01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:07.880
How about what is P?

01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:18.590
Ph of t would be m dX m dx dt.

01:13:18.590 --> 01:13:31.190
So you get minus m omega
sine omega tA plus m omega

01:13:31.190 --> 01:13:33.100
cosine omega tB.

01:13:38.053 --> 01:13:40.480
OK, so that's it.

01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:42.210
That is the most
general solution.

01:13:44.780 --> 01:13:50.280
But it still doesn't look like
what you would want, does it?

01:13:50.280 --> 01:13:54.580
No, because you haven't used
the time equals 0 conditions.

01:13:54.580 --> 01:13:57.430
At time equals 0, the
Heisenberg operators

01:13:57.430 --> 01:14:00.310
are identical they to the
Schrodinger operators.

01:14:00.310 --> 01:14:09.070
So at t equals 0,
Xh of t becomes A,

01:14:09.070 --> 01:14:15.440
but that must be X hat,
the Schrodinger operator.

01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:21.630
And at t equals
0, Ph of t becomes

01:14:21.630 --> 01:14:30.880
equal to this is 0
m omega B. And that

01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:35.580
must be equal to
the P hat operator.

01:14:35.580 --> 01:14:43.220
So actually we have already
now A and B. So B from here

01:14:43.220 --> 01:14:47.890
is P hat over m omega.

01:14:47.890 --> 01:14:55.040
And therefore Xh
of t is equal to A,

01:14:55.040 --> 01:15:00.370
which is X hat cosine
omega t plus B, which

01:15:00.370 --> 01:15:06.560
is P hat over m
omega sine omega t.

01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:12.660
An Ph of t is here.

01:15:12.660 --> 01:15:23.780
A is-- Ph of t is m omega
B, which is [INAUDIBLE] P.

01:15:23.780 --> 01:15:33.563
So it's P hat cosine
omega t minus m omega X

01:15:33.563 --> 01:15:36.050
hat sine omega t.

01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:43.800
So let's see.

01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:46.380
I hope I didn't make mistakes.

01:15:46.380 --> 01:15:50.360
P hat minus m omega
X hat sine omega t.

01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:53.000
Yep, this is correct.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:59.400
This is your whole solution
for the Heisenberg operators.

01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:04.990
So any expectation value
of any power of X and P

01:16:04.990 --> 01:16:08.630
that you will want to
find its time dependence,

01:16:08.630 --> 01:16:11.490
just put those
Heisenberg operators,

01:16:11.490 --> 01:16:15.630
and you will calculate things
with states at time equals 0.

01:16:15.630 --> 01:16:18.360
It will become very easy.

01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:20.760
So the last thing
I want to do is

01:16:20.760 --> 01:16:26.730
complete the promise
that we had about what

01:16:26.730 --> 01:16:30.520
is the Heisenberg Hamiltonian.

01:16:30.520 --> 01:16:34.440
Well, we had the Heisenberg
Hamiltonian there.

01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:38.300
And now we know the
Heisenberg operators

01:16:38.300 --> 01:16:43.800
in terms of the Schrodinger one.

01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:53.630
So Hh of t is equal to
Ph-- 1/2m Ph squared.

01:16:53.630 --> 01:17:01.550
So I have P hat cosine omega t
minus m omega X hat sine omega

01:17:01.550 --> 01:17:15.120
t squared plus 1/2 m
omega squared Xh squared.

01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:19.940
So X hat cosine
omega t plus P hat

01:17:19.940 --> 01:17:27.150
over m omega sine
omega t squared.

01:17:27.150 --> 01:17:30.810
So that's what the
Heisenberg Hamiltonian is.

01:17:30.810 --> 01:17:36.010
So let's simplify this.

01:17:36.010 --> 01:17:37.790
Well, let's square these things.

01:17:37.790 --> 01:17:47.310
You have 1/2m cosine squared
omega t P hat squared.

01:17:47.310 --> 01:17:50.750
Let's do the square of this one.

01:17:50.750 --> 01:17:57.340
You would have
plus 1/2m m squared

01:17:57.340 --> 01:18:07.440
omega squared sine
squared omega t X squared.

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.340
And then we have
the cross product,

01:18:12.340 --> 01:18:17.465
which would be plus--
or actually minus 1/2m.

01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:22.910
The product of these two things.

01:18:22.910 --> 01:18:29.900
m omega sine omega
t cosine omega t.

01:18:29.900 --> 01:18:35.670
And you have Px plus XP.

01:18:35.670 --> 01:18:45.000
OK, I squared the first terms.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:46.410
Now the second one.

01:18:46.410 --> 01:18:49.120
Well, let's square
the P squared here.

01:18:49.120 --> 01:18:51.540
What do we have?

01:18:51.540 --> 01:18:57.950
1/2 m omega squared
over m squared

01:18:57.950 --> 01:19:06.120
omega squared sine squared
of omega t P squared.

01:19:06.120 --> 01:19:11.740
The x plus 1/2 m
omega squared cosine

01:19:11.740 --> 01:19:14.965
squared omega t X squared.

01:19:17.740 --> 01:19:20.880
And the cross term.

01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:37.990
Plus 1/2 m omega squared over
m omega times cosine omega t

01:19:37.990 --> 01:19:42.863
sine omega t XP plus PX.

01:19:45.540 --> 01:19:49.740
A little bit of work,
but what do we get?

01:19:49.740 --> 01:19:52.330
Well, 1/2 m.

01:19:52.330 --> 01:19:56.170
And here we must
have 1/2 m, correct.

01:19:56.170 --> 01:19:58.190
1/2 m.

01:19:58.190 --> 01:20:01.040
Sine squared omega t P squared.

01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:05.680
So this is equal
1/2 m P squared.

01:20:08.370 --> 01:20:14.180
These one's, hall here you
have 1/2 m omega squared.

01:20:14.180 --> 01:20:18.440
So it's 1/2 m omega
squared cosine and sine

01:20:18.440 --> 01:20:21.930
squared is X hat squared.

01:20:21.930 --> 01:20:26.430
And then here we have
all being over 2.

01:20:26.430 --> 01:20:30.970
And here omega over 2,
same factors, same factors,

01:20:30.970 --> 01:20:33.350
opposite signs.

01:20:33.350 --> 01:20:35.460
Very good.

01:20:35.460 --> 01:20:37.000
Schrodinger Hamiltonian.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:41.340
So you confirm that this
theoretical expectation

01:20:41.340 --> 01:20:43.350
is absolutely correct.

01:20:43.350 --> 01:20:45.100
And what's the meaning?

01:20:45.100 --> 01:20:47.900
You have the
Heisenberg Hamiltonian

01:20:47.900 --> 01:20:51.000
written in terms of the
Heisenberg variables.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:57.040
But by the time you substitute
these Heisenberg variables in,

01:20:57.040 --> 01:21:01.130
it just becomes identical to
the Schrodinger Hamiltonian.

01:21:01.130 --> 01:21:03.530
All right, so that's
all for today.

01:21:03.530 --> 01:21:07.420
I hope to see in office
hours in the coming days.

01:21:07.420 --> 01:21:13.160
Be here Wednesday 12:30,
maybe 12:25 would be better,

01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:16.800
and we'll see you then.

01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:18.350
[APPLAUSE]
