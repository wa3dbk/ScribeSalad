00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:21.480
PROFESSOR: Alright.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.790
So what we are doing
is covering 8.334,

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:30.225
which is statistical physics.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:41.160
ANd let me remind you that
basically statistical physics

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:52.630
is a bridge from microscopic
to macroscopic perspectives.

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:58.330
And I'm going to emphasize a
lot on changing perspectives.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:03.210
So at the level
of the micro, you

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.760
have the microstate that
is characterized, maybe,

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.070
by a collection of momenta
and coordinates of particles,

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.390
such as particles
of gas in this room.

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.830
Maybe those
particles have spins.

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.870
If you are absorbing
things on a surface,

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.840
you may have variables that
denote the occupation--

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.820
whether a particle or
site is occupied or not.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.600
And when you're looking
at the microscopic world,

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.340
typically you are
interested in how

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.800
things change as a
function of time.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.170
You have a kind of
dynamics that is governed

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.340
by some kind of a
[INAUDIBLE] which

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.110
is dependent on the microstate
that you are looking at,

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.071
and tells you about the
evolution of the microstate.

00:01:57.071 --> 00:02:00.460
At the other extreme,
you look at the world

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.780
around you and the macro world.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.919
You're dealing with
things that are described

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:11.910
by completely different things.

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.320
For example, if you're
thinking about the gas,

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.340
you have the pressure.

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.310
You have the volume.

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.450
So somehow, the
coordinates managed

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:26.900
to define and macrostate,
which is characterized

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.860
by a few parameters
in equilibrium.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.680
If you have something like
a collection of spins,

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.030
maybe you will have
a magnetization.

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.870
And again, another
important thing

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.280
that characterizes
the equilibrium we

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.140
describe as temperature.

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.980
And when you're
looking at things

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.870
from the perspective of
macro systems in equilibrium,

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.170
then you have the
laws of thermodynamics

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:01.810
that govern constraints that
are placed on these variables.

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.290
So totally different
perspectives.

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.580
And what we have is that we
need to build a bridge from one

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.710
to the other and this
bridge is provided

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:16.490
by statistical mechanics.

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:21.650
And the way that we described
it in the previous course

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.710
is that to what you need is
a probabilistic prescription.

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:28.950
So rather than following
the time evolution

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.180
of all of these
degrees of freedom,

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.280
you'll have a
probability assigned

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.700
to the different
microstates that

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.640
are dependent on
the macro state.

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.470
And for example,
if you are dealing

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.240
in the canonical
ensemble, then you

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.660
know you're at the
particular temperature

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.040
this form has E to the
minus beta, this Hamiltonian

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.930
that we you have here
governing the dynamics.

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.320
Beta was one over KT.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.070
So I could write
it in this fashion.

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:05.880
And the thing that
enabled us to make

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:11.030
a connection between this
deterministic perspective

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.780
and this equilibrium description
wire probabilities abilities

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:21.910
was relying on the limit
where the number of degrees

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.070
of freedom was very large.

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:28.350
And this very large number
of degrees of freedom

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.840
enabled us to, although we had
something that was probably

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.810
realistic, to really make very
precise statements about what

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.080
was happening.

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:45.036
Now, when we were doing
this program in 8-333,

00:04:45.036 --> 00:04:50.490
we looked at very simple systems
that were essentially non

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.730
interacting, like the ideal gas.

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:58.470
Or we put a little bit
of weak perturbation

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:04.430
and by some manipulations,
we got things like liquids.

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.690
But the important thing is
that where is this program

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:12.380
we could carry out precisely
when we had no interactions.

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:18.320
In the presence
of interactions we

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:22.350
encountered, even in our
simplified perspective,

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:23.140
new things.

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:25.910
We went from the gas
state to a liquid state.

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:28.430
We didn't discuss
it, but we certainly

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:30.850
said a few things about solids.

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:36.700
And clearly there are much
more interesting things

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:39.430
that can happen when
you have interactions.

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:43.060
You could have other phases of
matter that we didn't discuss,

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:50.000
such as liquid crystals,
superconductors,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.050
and many, many other things.

00:05:55.050 --> 00:06:02.570
So the key idea is that you
can solve things that are not

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:04.950
interacting going
their own ways,

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:08.260
but when you put
interactions, you

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.990
get interesting
collective behaviors.

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:22.780
And what we want to do
in 8-334, as opposed

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:26.990
to just building the
machinery in 8-333,

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:30.150
is to think about all
of the different types

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:33.060
of collective behavior
that are possible

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:39.020
and how to describe them in
the realm of classical systems.

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:42.610
So we won't go much into the
realm of quantum systems, which

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:46.420
is also quite interesting as far
as its own collective behaviors

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:48.310
is concerned.

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:51.390
So that's the program.

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:54.630
Now, what I would
like to do is to go

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:58.800
to the description of the
organization of the class,

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:03.770
and hopefully this web
page will come back online.

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:20.700
So repeating what I was
saying before, the idea is

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:24.310
that interactions
give rise to a variety

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:27.950
of interesting
collective behaviors,

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:32.440
starting from pretty much
simple degrees of freedom

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:35.130
such as atoms and molecules
and adding a little bit

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:37.960
of interactions and
complexity to them,

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:43.570
you could get a variety of, for
example, liquid crystal phases.

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:49.150
But one of things to think about
is that you think about all

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:52.260
of the different atoms
and molecules that you

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.670
can put together, and the
different interactions that you

00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:59.270
could put among them-- you
could even imagine things

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:02.970
that you construct in the lab
that didn't exist in nature--

00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:08.570
and you put them together,
but the types of new behavior

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:11.390
that you encounter
is not that much.

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:15.380
At some level, you learn about
the three phases of matter,

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:20.150
gas, liquids, solids, of course,
as I said, there are many more,

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:22.540
but there are not
hundreds of them.

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:24.270
There are just a few.

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:28.790
So the question is why, given
the complexity of interactions

00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:31.530
that you can have at
the microscopic scale,

00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:33.919
you put things
together, and you really

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:37.370
don't get that many
variety of things

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:39.330
at the macroscopic level.

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:44.190
And the answer has to do with
mathematical consistency,

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:47.370
and has at its heart
something that you already

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:51.570
saw in 8-333, which is
the central limit theorem.

00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:56.880
You take many random
variables of whatever ilk

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:59.820
and you add them
together, and the sum

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:03.010
has a nice simple
Gaussian distribution.

00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:08.830
So somehow mathematics forces
things to become simplified

00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:11.740
when you put many
of them together.

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:13.680
So the same thing
is happening when

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:16.950
you put lots of interacting
pieces together.

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:20.290
New collective behaviors
emerge, but because

00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:22.580
of the simplification,
in the same sense

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:25.390
the type of simplification that
we see with the central limit

00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:28.900
theorem, there aren't that
many consistent mathematical

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:31.750
descriptions that can emerge.

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:36.480
Of course, there
are nice new ones,

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:40.050
and the question is
how to describe them.

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:46.500
So this issue of what
are possible consistent

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:49.800
mathematical forms
is what we will

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:53.190
address through constructing
these statistical field

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:54.120
theories.

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:57.830
So one of the
important things that I

00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:05.090
will try to impose upon you
is to change your perspective.

00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:08.640
In the same way that there is
a big change of perspective

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:12.970
thinking about the microscopic
and macroscopic board,

00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:16.770
there is also a change
of perspective involved

00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:22.240
in the idea of starting from
interacting degrees of freedom,

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:24.730
and changing perspective
and constructing

00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:26.770
a statistical future.

00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:29.550
And I'll give you one
example of that today

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:32.370
that you're hopefully
all familiar with,

00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:36.710
but it shows very much how this
change of perspective works,

00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:38.720
and that's the
kind of metallurgy

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:41.800
that we will apply
in this course.

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:47.780
Basically the syllabus
is as follows.

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:56.650
So initially I will try
to emphasize to you how,

00:10:56.650 --> 00:11:00.360
by looking at things,
by averaging over

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:06.660
many degrees of freedom, at long
lens scales and time scales,

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:11.660
you get simplified statistical
field theory descriptions.

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:14.070
The simplest one of
these that appears

00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:18.120
in many different contexts
is this Landau-Ginzburg model

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:22.820
that will occupy us for
quite a few lectures.

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:25.955
Now once you construct
a description of one

00:11:25.955 --> 00:11:27.680
of these statistical
field theories,

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:30.510
the question is how
do you solve it.

00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:32.850
And there are a
number of approaches

00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:37.450
that we will follow such as
mean field theory, et cetera.

00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:40.830
And what we'll find is
that those descriptions

00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:43.430
fail in certain dimensions.

00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:46.070
And then to do
better than that, you

00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:50.160
have to rely on things such
as perturbation theory.

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:52.490
So this is kind of
perturbation theory

00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:55.350
that builds upon the types
of perturbation theory

00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:58.130
that we did in the
previous semester, what

00:11:58.130 --> 00:12:00.860
is closer to the kind
of perturbation theory

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:05.330
that you would be doing
in quantum field theories.

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:07.885
Alongside these
continuum theories,

00:12:07.885 --> 00:12:13.480
I will also develop some lattice
models, that in certain limits,

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:19.040
are simpler and admit
either numerical approaches

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:22.380
or exact solutions.

00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:26.940
The key idea that we
will try to learn about

00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:31.110
is that of Kadanoff's
perspective of renormalization

00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:35.480
group and how you
can, in some sense,

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:38.600
change your perspective
continuously

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:42.160
by looking at how a
system would look over

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:44.730
larger and larger
landscape, and how

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:48.150
the mathematical description
that you have for the system

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:51.250
changes as a function of
the scale of observation,

00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:57.250
and hopefully becomes simple
at sufficiently large scales.

00:12:57.250 --> 00:13:03.060
So we will conclude by looking
at a variety of applications

00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:05.260
of the methodologies
that we have developed.

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:08.640
For example, in the context
of two dimensional films,

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:15.180
and potentially if we have
time, a number of other systems.

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:20.930
The first thing that I'm going--
the rest of the lecture today

00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:24.900
has essentially nothing in
common with the material

00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:29.000
that we will start to cover
as of the second lecture.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.380
But it illustrates this
change in perspective

00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:35.880
that is essential to
the way of thinking

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:38.860
about the material
in this course.

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:45.490
And the context that I will use
to introduce this perspective

00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:47.040
is phonons and elasticity.

00:13:55.810 --> 00:14:00.680
So you look around you,
there's a whole bunch

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:03.360
of different solids.

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:07.090
There's metals, there's
wood, et cetera.

00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:09.380
And for each one
of them, you can

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:13.330
ask things about their
thermodynamic properties, heat

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:17.230
content, for example,
heat capacity.

00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:21.560
They are constructed of various
very different materials.

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:24.900
And so let's try
to think, if you're

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:29.130
going to start
from this left side

00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:31.470
from the microscopic
perspective,

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:35.000
how we would approach
the problem of the heat

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.200
content of these solids.

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:47.570
So you would say that solids,
if I were to go to 0 temperature

00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:52.073
before I put any heat into them,
they would be perfect crystals.

00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:57.570
What does that mean?

00:14:57.570 --> 00:15:06.000
It means that if I look at
the positions of these atoms

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.300
or particles that are making
up the crystal-- I guess

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:15.180
I have to be more specific since
a metal is composed of nuclei

00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:16.940
and electrons--
let's imagine that we

00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:19.860
look at the positions
of the ions.

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:23.320
Then in the perfect
position they

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:27.450
will form a lattice where I
will pick three integers, L M

00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:35.110
N and three unit
vectors, and I can

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:40.960
list the positions of all of
these ions in the crystal.

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:47.180
So this combination
L M N that indicates

00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:52.620
the location of some particular
ion in the perfect solid

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:56.820
that's indicated by,
let's say, the vector r.

00:15:56.820 --> 00:16:03.580
So this is the position that I
would have ideally for the ion

00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:07.530
at zero temperature
that is labelled by r.

00:16:07.530 --> 00:16:10.460
Now, of course when we go
to finite temperatures,

00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:16.815
the particles, rather than
forming this nice lattice,

00:16:16.815 --> 00:16:20.910
let's imagine a square
lattice in two dimension,

00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:24.040
starts to move around.

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:29.980
And they're no longer going
to be perfect positions.

00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:37.800
And these distortions we can
indicate by some vector u.

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:43.980
So when we have perfect
crystals across deformations,

00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:48.930
this Q star changes
to a new position,

00:16:48.930 --> 00:16:57.110
Q of r, which is it's ideal
position plus a distortion

00:16:57.110 --> 00:17:02.350
field u, at each location.

00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:04.260
OK?

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:07.940
Now associated with these
change of positions,

00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:12.619
you have moved away from the
lowest energy configuration.

00:17:12.619 --> 00:17:15.030
You have put energy
in the system.

00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:19.680
And you would say that
the energy of the system

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:22.470
is going to be composed
of the following parts.

00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:26.240
There's always going to be
some kind of a kinetic energy.

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:32.650
That's sum over r p
r squared over 2 m.

00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:36.780
Let's imagine particles
all have the same mass m.

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:43.760
And then the reason
that these particles

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:46.830
form this perfect
crystal was presumably

00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:49.620
because of the overlap
of electronic wave

00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:50.950
functions, et cetera.

00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:54.980
Eventually, if you're
looking at these coordinates,

00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:58.070
there's some kind of
a many body potential

00:17:58.070 --> 00:18:01.546
as a function of the positions
of all of these particles.

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:13.970
Now, what we are doing
is we are looking

00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:17.970
at distortions that are small.

00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:19.690
So let's imagine
that you haven't

00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:24.180
gone to such high temperatures
where this crystal completely

00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:27.300
melts and disappears and
gives us something else.

00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:32.490
But we have small
changes from what

00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:35.740
we had at zero temperature.

00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:39.690
So presumably the
crystal corresponds

00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:44.140
to the configuration that
gives us the minimum energy.

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:50.680
And then if I make a distortion
and expand this potential

00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:54.880
in the distortion field, the
lowest order term proportional

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:58.010
to various u's will
disappear because I'm

00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:00.130
expanding around the minimum.

00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:02.050
And the first thing
that I will get

00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:04.340
is from the second order term.

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:09.685
So I have one half sum over
the different positions.

00:19:09.685 --> 00:19:13.290
I have to do the second
derivative of the potential

00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:14.756
with respect to
these deformations.

00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:22.250
Of course, if I am
in three dimensions,

00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:27.080
I also have three spatial
indices, x, y, and z,

00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:31.170
so I would have to take
derivatives with respect

00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:35.200
to the different
coordinates, alpha and beta,

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:37.130
and summed over them.

00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:42.560
And then I have u alpha
of r, u beta of r prime.

00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:45.060
And then, of course, I will
have higher order terms

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:46.600
in this expansion.

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:50.270
This is a general potential,
so then in higher order terms,

00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:54.040
it would be order of
u cubed and higher.

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:56.730
OK?

00:19:56.730 --> 00:19:58.550
Fine?

00:19:58.550 --> 00:20:02.860
So I have a system of this form.

00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:08.900
Now, typically,
the next stage if I

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:11.520
stop at the quadratic
level-- this

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:14.940
I would do for a molecule
also, not only for a solid--

00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:19.060
is to try to find the
normal modes of the system.

00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:23.260
Normal modes I have to
obtain by diagonalizing

00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:27.150
this matrix of
second derivatives.

00:20:27.150 --> 00:20:31.300
Now, there are a few things
that I know that help me,

00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:33.650
and one of the
things that I know

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:39.090
is that because the original
structure was a perfect solid,

00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:46.120
let's say, then there
will be a matrix-- sorry,

00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:49.180
there will be an element of
the second derivative that

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:52.670
corresponds to that
r and this r prime.

00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:55.720
That's going to be the same
as the second derivative that

00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:59.120
connects these two points,
because this pair of points

00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:01.050
is obtained by the
first pair of points

00:21:01.050 --> 00:21:03.400
by simple translation
among the lattice.

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:06.540
The environment for
this is exactly the same

00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:08.960
as the environment for this.

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:15.250
So essentially, what I'm stating
is that this function does not

00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:20.170
depend on r and r prime
separately, but only

00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:23.216
on the difference
between r and r prime.

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:32.180
So, I know a lot--
so this is not

00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:36.420
if I had n atoms
in my system, this

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:40.560
is not something like n squared
over 2 independent things,

00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:43.970
it is a much lower number.

00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:47.450
The fact that I have
such a lower number

00:21:47.450 --> 00:22:00.720
allows me to calculate the
normal modes of the system

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:01.625
by Fourier transform.

00:22:12.950 --> 00:22:16.530
I won't be very
precise about how

00:22:16.530 --> 00:22:18.800
we perform Fourier transforms.

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:22.380
Basically I start with
this k alpha beta,

00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:25.750
which is a function
of separation.

00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:32.465
I can do a sum over all of
these separations r of e

00:22:32.465 --> 00:22:39.150
to the i K dot r, for
appropriately chosen k.

00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:43.660
And summing over all pairs of
differences, so the argument

00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:49.360
r here now, is what was
previously r minus r prime.

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:53.340
So basically, what I can
do is I can pick one point

00:22:53.340 --> 00:23:00.560
and go and look at all of the
separations from that point.

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:06.520
Construct this object, this will
give me the Fourier transformed

00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:10.422
object that depends
on the vague number k.

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:16.600
So if I look at the
potential energy

00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:24.940
of this system minus its value
at zero temperature, which

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:29.890
from one perspective was
one half sum over r r

00:23:29.890 --> 00:23:37.075
prime alpha beta, is k alpha
beta, r minus r prime, u alpha

00:23:37.075 --> 00:23:46.380
of r, u beta of r prime, in
the quadratic approximation.

00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:55.700
If I do Fourier transforms
what happens because it is only

00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:58.910
a function of r minus r
prime, and not r and r prime

00:23:58.910 --> 00:24:01.935
separately, is that
in Fourier space,

00:24:01.935 --> 00:24:08.630
it separates out into
a sum that depends only

00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:11.110
on individual K modes.

00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:14.450
There's no coupling
between k and k prime.

00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:19.300
So here we have r and r prime,
but by the time we get here,

00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:22.520
we just have one
k, alpha and beta.

00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:26.545
We'll do one example of that
in more detail later on.

00:24:26.545 --> 00:24:32.130
I have the Fourier
transformed object,

00:24:32.130 --> 00:24:36.950
and then I have u alpha
k Fourier transform.

00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:40.550
So in the same manner
that I Fourier transformed

00:24:40.550 --> 00:24:44.565
this kernel, k alpha
beta, I can put here a u

00:24:44.565 --> 00:24:54.690
and end up here with a U tilde
and u tilde beta of k star.

00:25:01.270 --> 00:25:05.910
So we start over
here, if you like.

00:25:05.910 --> 00:25:11.790
If I have n particles with
a matrix that is n by n--

00:25:11.790 --> 00:25:17.630
actually 3n by 3n if I
account for the three

00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:23.300
different orientations-- and
by going to Fourier transforms,

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:29.500
we have separated it out for
each of n potential Fourier

00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:34.020
components, we just have
a three by three matrix.

00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:38.230
And so then we can potentially
diagonalize this three

00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:51.620
by three matrix to get two
eigenvalues, lambda alpha of K.

00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:55.280
Once I have the
eigenvalues of the system,

00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:57.430
then I can find frequencies
or eigenfrequencies.

00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:09.380
Omega alpha of K,
which would be related

00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:12.586
to this lambda alpha
of K divided by m.

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:22.340
So you go through
this entire process.

00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:25.562
The idea was you start
with different solids.

00:26:25.562 --> 00:26:29.220
You want to know what the
heat content of the solid is.

00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:31.890
You have to make
various approximations

00:26:31.890 --> 00:26:35.040
to even think about
the normal modes.

00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:36.828
You can see that you
have to figure out

00:26:36.828 --> 00:26:38.286
what this kernel
of the interaction

00:26:38.286 --> 00:26:42.830
is-- Fourier transform it,
diagonalize it, et cetera

00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:45.730
And ultimately thing that
you're after is that there are

00:26:45.730 --> 00:26:50.550
these frequencies as a
function of wave number.

00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:52.290
Actually, it's
really a wave vector,

00:26:52.290 --> 00:26:56.660
because there will be three
different-- Kx, Ky and Kz.

00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:59.360
And at each one
of these K values,

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:03.350
you will have three
eigenfrequencies.

00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:07.610
And presumably as
you span K, you

00:27:07.610 --> 00:27:12.400
will have a whole
bunch of lines that

00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:16.260
will correspond to the
variations of these frequencies

00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:18.910
as a function of K.

00:27:18.910 --> 00:27:21.030
Why is that useful?

00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:23.180
Well, the reason
that it's useful

00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:26.840
is that as you go
to high temperature,

00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:31.770
you put the energies into these
normal modes and frequencies.

00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:35.380
That's why this whole
lattice is vibrating.

00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:38.150
And the amount of
energy that you

00:27:38.150 --> 00:27:45.110
have put at temperature
T on top of this V0

00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:48.470
that you had at
zero temperature,

00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:51.290
up to constants
of proportionality

00:27:51.290 --> 00:27:54.520
that I don't want
to bother with is

00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:59.410
a sum over all of these normal
modes that are characterized

00:27:59.410 --> 00:28:06.480
by K and alpha, the polarization
and the wave vector.

00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:08.370
And the amount of
energy, then, that you

00:28:08.370 --> 00:28:14.030
would put in one harmonic
oscillator of frequency omega.

00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:16.010
And that is something
that's we know

00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:23.235
to be h bar omega alpha of
K, divided by e to the beta h

00:28:23.235 --> 00:28:26.960
bar omega alpha of K minus 1.

00:28:30.970 --> 00:28:33.650
So the temperature
dependence then

00:28:33.650 --> 00:28:37.480
appears in this factor
of beta over here.

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:40.550
So the energy
content went there,

00:28:40.550 --> 00:28:43.350
and if you want to,
for example, ultimately

00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:46.640
calculate heat capacity,
I have to calculate

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:49.020
this whole quantity as a
function of temperature.

00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:52.150
And then take the derivative.

00:28:52.150 --> 00:28:57.380
So it seems like, OK, I have to
do this for every single solid,

00:28:57.380 --> 00:29:01.970
whether it's copper,
aluminium, wood, or whatever.

00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:05.630
I have to figure out what
these frequencies are,

00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:08.320
what's the energy content
in each frequency.

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:13.415
And it seems like a complicated
engineering problem,

00:29:13.415 --> 00:29:14.900
if you like.

00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:19.150
Is that it about
this that transcends

00:29:19.150 --> 00:29:24.990
having to look at all of these
details and come to this?

00:29:24.990 --> 00:29:27.760
And of course, you know
the answer already,

00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:31.920
which is that if I go to
sufficiently low temperature,

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:37.930
I know that the heat capacity
due to phonons for all solids

00:29:37.930 --> 00:29:40.540
goes like t cubed.

00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:44.100
So somehow, all of
this complexity,

00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:48.010
if I go to low enough
temperature, disappears.

00:29:48.010 --> 00:29:53.610
And some universal law emerges
that is completely independent

00:29:53.610 --> 00:29:56.390
of all of these
details-- microscopics,

00:29:56.390 --> 00:29:58.890
interactions, et cetera.

00:29:58.890 --> 00:30:03.400
So our task-- this is the
change of perspective--

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:08.660
is to find a way to
circumvent all of these things

00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:13.110
and get immediately to the heart
of the matter, the part that

00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:16.510
is independent of the details.

00:30:16.510 --> 00:30:18.320
Not that the details
are irrelevant.

00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:20.900
Because after all, if you
want to give some material

00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:24.030
that functions at some
particular set of temperatures,

00:30:24.030 --> 00:30:28.320
you would need to know much
more than this t cubed law

00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:30.260
that I'm telling you about.

00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:33.460
But maybe from the
perspective of what

00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:37.610
I was saying before-- how
many independent forms there

00:30:37.610 --> 00:30:41.470
are, in the same sense that
adding up random variables

00:30:41.470 --> 00:30:42.896
always gives you a Gaussian.

00:30:42.896 --> 00:30:45.270
Of course, you don't know
where the mean and the variance

00:30:45.270 --> 00:30:48.590
of the Gaussian is, but you are
sure that it's a Gaussian form.

00:30:48.590 --> 00:30:52.420
So similarly, there is some
universality in the knowledge

00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:55.130
that, no matter how
complicated the material is,

00:30:55.130 --> 00:30:58.230
its low temperature heat
capacity is t cubed.

00:30:58.230 --> 00:31:04.750
Can we get that by an approach
that circumvents the details?

00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:07.330
So I'm going to do that.

00:31:07.330 --> 00:31:10.580
But before, since I did a
little bit of hand-waving,

00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:18.580
to be more precise, let's do
the one-dimensional example

00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:21.080
in a little bit more detail.

00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:24.970
So my one-dimensional
solid is going

00:31:24.970 --> 00:31:29.790
to be a bunch of
ions or molecules

00:31:29.790 --> 00:31:32.890
or whatever, whose
zero temperature

00:31:32.890 --> 00:31:42.060
positions is uniformly separated
by some lattice spacing,

00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:44.470
a, around one dimension.

00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:49.260
And if I look at
the formations, I'm

00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:54.720
going to indicate them by the
one-dimensional distortion

00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:59.370
Un of the nth one
along this chain.

00:31:59.370 --> 00:32:04.550
So then I would say, OK, the
potential energy of this system

00:32:04.550 --> 00:32:08.730
minus whatever it is at zero,
just because of the distortion,

00:32:08.730 --> 00:32:14.400
I will write as follows--
it is a sum over n.

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:20.090
And one thing that
I can do is to say

00:32:20.090 --> 00:32:25.010
that if I look at two of these
things that are originally

00:32:25.010 --> 00:32:30.180
at distance a, and then they
go and the deform by Un and Un

00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:34.210
plus 1, the additional
deformation from a

00:32:34.210 --> 00:32:37.520
is actually Un plus 1 minus Un.

00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:39.710
So I can put some
kind of Hookean

00:32:39.710 --> 00:32:44.950
elasticity and write
it in this fashion.

00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:49.450
Now of course, there could be an
interaction that goes to second

00:32:49.450 --> 00:32:50.750
neighbours.

00:32:50.750 --> 00:32:55.240
So I can write that as
K2 over 2, Un plus 2,

00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:59.710
minus Un squared and third
neighbors, and so forth.

00:32:59.710 --> 00:33:03.990
I can add as many
of these as I like

00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:07.930
to make it as
general as possible.

00:33:07.930 --> 00:33:13.060
So in some sense, this is a
kind of rewriting of the form

00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:19.030
that I had written over
here, where these things that

00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:22.010
where a function
of the separation--

00:33:22.010 --> 00:33:27.220
these K alpha beta of separation
or these K1, K2, K3, et

00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:30.970
cetera-- in this series
that you would write down.

00:33:30.970 --> 00:33:36.770
Now if you go to
Fourier space, what

00:33:36.770 --> 00:33:45.210
you can do is each Un
of Un, is the distortion

00:33:45.210 --> 00:33:47.940
in the original perspective,
you can Fourier transform.

00:33:54.170 --> 00:34:02.890
And write it as a sum over K
e to the ik position the nth

00:34:02.890 --> 00:34:09.184
particle is na,
times u tilde of k.

00:34:13.150 --> 00:34:17.770
And once you make
this Fourier transform

00:34:17.770 --> 00:34:21.570
in the expression over
here, you get an expression

00:34:21.570 --> 00:34:25.639
for V minus V0 in terms
of the Fourier modes.

00:34:25.639 --> 00:34:28.420
So rather than
having an expression

00:34:28.420 --> 00:34:33.270
in terms of the amplitudes u
sub n, after Fourier transform,

00:34:33.270 --> 00:34:37.150
I will have an expiration
in terms of u tilde of k.

00:34:37.150 --> 00:34:39.280
So let's see what that is.

00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:41.860
Forget about various
proportionality.

00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:44.590
I have the sum over n.

00:34:44.590 --> 00:34:48.550
Each one of the Un's I can
write in this fashion in terms

00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:52.920
of U tilde of K. Since
this is a quadratic form,

00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:55.380
I need to have two of these.

00:34:55.380 --> 00:34:57.815
So I will have the
sum of k and k prime.

00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:05.980
I have the factor of 1/2.

00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:12.480
Each Un goes with a
factor of e to the i nak.

00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:17.260
But then I had 2 Un.

00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:21.100
There's a term here, if I do the
expansion, which is Un squared.

00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:24.670
So I have one from k
and one from k prime.

00:35:29.910 --> 00:35:33.431
However, if I have
Un plus 1 minus Un,

00:35:33.431 --> 00:35:40.000
what I have is e
to the ika minus 1.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.010
I already took the contribution
that was e to the ink.

00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:48.326
From the second
factor, I will get e

00:35:48.326 --> 00:35:51.570
to the ik prime a minus 1.

00:35:51.570 --> 00:35:56.770
This multiplies K1 over 2.

00:35:56.770 --> 00:36:01.260
And then I will have
something that's K2 over 2,

00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:10.560
e to the 2ika minus 1, e to 2i
k prime a minus 1, and so forth.

00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:14.730
Multiplying at the end
of the day U tilde of k,

00:36:14.730 --> 00:36:17.156
U tilde of k prime.

00:36:25.060 --> 00:36:29.680
Now when I do the sum over
n, and the only n dependence

00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:35.670
appears over here,
then this is the thing

00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:38.920
that forces k and k
prime to add up to 0,

00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:40.680
because if they
don't add up to 0,

00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:43.360
then I'm adding lots of
random phases together.

00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:45.220
And the answer will be 0.

00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:47.700
So essentially, this
sum will give me

00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:53.370
a delta function that forces
k plus k prime to be 0.

00:36:53.370 --> 00:36:58.800
And so then the additional
potential energy that you have

00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:04.930
because of the distortion ends
up being proportional to 1/2,

00:37:04.930 --> 00:37:09.040
sum over the different k's.

00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:11.800
Only one k will
remain, because k prime

00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:14.300
is forced to be minus k.

00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:20.240
And so I have U of k,
U of minus k, which

00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:23.920
is the same thing as U
of k complex conjugate.

00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:26.320
So I will get that.

00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:32.200
And then from here,
I will get K1.

00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:34.810
Now then, k prime
is set to minus k.

00:37:34.810 --> 00:37:37.370
And when I multiply
these two factors,

00:37:37.370 --> 00:37:41.940
I will get 1 plus 1
minus e to the ika minus

00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:43.480
e to the minus ika.

00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:46.880
So I will get 2
minus 2 cosine of ka.

00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:56.888
And then I will have K2, 2 minus
cosine of 2ka, and so forth.

00:38:02.791 --> 00:38:03.874
Why are the lights not on?

00:38:37.806 --> 00:38:42.408
OK, still visible.

00:38:42.408 --> 00:38:45.750
So yes?

00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:48.690
AUDIENCE: So in your last slide,
you have an absolute value Uk,

00:38:48.690 --> 00:38:53.860
but wouldn't it
be-- right above it,

00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:59.280
is it U of k times U star of k
prime, or how does that work?

00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:01.140
PROFESSOR: OK, so
the way that I have

00:39:01.140 --> 00:39:04.820
written is each
Un I have written

00:39:04.820 --> 00:39:08.380
in terms of U tilde of k.

00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:15.020
And at this first stage, the two
factors of Un that I have here,

00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:18.860
I treat them completely
equivalently with indices k

00:39:18.860 --> 00:39:20.030
and k prime.

00:39:20.030 --> 00:39:23.860
So there is no complex
conjugation involved here.

00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:27.920
But when k prime is
set to be minus k,

00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:33.180
then I additionally realize that
if I Fourier transform here,

00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:37.245
I will find that
U tilde of minus k

00:39:37.245 --> 00:39:41.590
is the same thing as
U tilde of k star.

00:39:41.590 --> 00:39:46.180
Because essentially, the complex
conjugation appears over here.

00:39:52.144 --> 00:39:54.640
It's not that important a point.

00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:57.470
The important point
is that we now

00:39:57.470 --> 00:40:00.660
have an expression
for our frequencies,

00:40:00.660 --> 00:40:04.920
or omega alpha of k-- actually,
there's no polarization.

00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:09.060
It's just omega
of k-- are related

00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:12.760
to square root of something
like a mass down here.

00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:14.620
Again, that's not
particularly important,

00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:20.868
but something like k1, 2
minus 2 cosine of ka, k2, 2

00:40:20.868 --> 00:40:26.269
minus 2 cosine of
2ka, and so forth.

00:40:32.190 --> 00:40:37.244
So I can plot these frequencies
omega as a function of k.

00:40:40.190 --> 00:40:43.180
One thing to note
is first of all,

00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:45.740
the expression is
clearly symmetric under k

00:40:45.740 --> 00:40:49.570
goes to minus k, so it only
depends on cosine of k.

00:40:49.570 --> 00:40:52.570
So it is sufficient
to draw one side.

00:40:52.570 --> 00:40:55.920
The other side for negative
k would be the opposite.

00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:59.050
The other thing to
note is that again,

00:40:59.050 --> 00:41:00.852
if I do this Fourier
transformation,

00:41:00.852 --> 00:41:04.240
and I have things
that are spaced by a,

00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:06.620
it effectively means that
the shortest wavelength

00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:10.370
that I have to deal with
are of the order of k, which

00:41:10.370 --> 00:41:17.910
means that the wave numbers
are also kind of limited

00:41:17.910 --> 00:41:20.900
by something that
I can't go beyond.

00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:25.130
So there's something that in
the generalized over here,

00:41:25.130 --> 00:41:29.170
you recall that your k vectors
are within the Brillouin zone.

00:41:29.170 --> 00:41:33.375
In one dimension, the Brillouin
zone is simply between minus 5

00:41:33.375 --> 00:41:36.390
over a and 5 over a.

00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:43.920
Now the interesting thing to
note is that as k goes to 0,

00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:45.130
omega goes to 0.

00:41:45.130 --> 00:41:48.350
Because all of these factors
you can see, as k goes to 0,

00:41:48.350 --> 00:41:49.670
vanish.

00:41:49.670 --> 00:41:52.630
In particular, if I
start expanding around k

00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:56.037
close to zero, what I find
is that all of these things

00:41:56.037 --> 00:41:56.620
are quadratic.

00:41:56.620 --> 00:41:59.110
They go like k squared.

00:41:59.110 --> 00:42:00.855
So when I take the
square root, they

00:42:00.855 --> 00:42:03.950
will have an
absolute value of k.

00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:09.955
So I know for sure that
these omegas start with that.

00:42:12.570 --> 00:42:16.380
What I don't know, since
I have no idea what k1,

00:42:16.380 --> 00:42:21.147
k2, et cetera are, is
what they do out here.

00:42:21.147 --> 00:42:23.230
So there could be some
kind of a strange spaghetti

00:42:23.230 --> 00:42:27.210
or going on over
here, I have no idea.

00:42:27.210 --> 00:42:29.190
There's all kinds of complexity.

00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:32.410
But they are away from
the k close to 0 part.

00:42:34.970 --> 00:42:38.530
Again, why does it go 0?

00:42:38.530 --> 00:42:41.120
Of course, k equals
to 0 corresponds

00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:44.950
to taking the entire
chain and translating it.

00:42:44.950 --> 00:42:48.020
And clearly, I
constructed this such

00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:50.410
that all of the U's
are the same-- I

00:42:50.410 --> 00:42:54.660
take everything and translate
it-- there's no energy cost.

00:42:54.660 --> 00:42:58.930
So there's no energy
costs for k equals to 0.

00:42:58.930 --> 00:43:03.706
The energy costs for
small k have to be small.

00:43:03.706 --> 00:43:06.470
By symmetry, they have
to be quadratic in case,

00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:09.680
so I take the square root
and we will get a linear.

00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:12.670
Of course, you know
that this linear part--

00:43:12.670 --> 00:43:19.140
we can say that omega is
something like a sum velocity.

00:43:19.140 --> 00:43:22.670
So all of these
chains, when I go

00:43:22.670 --> 00:43:29.900
to low enough case or
low enough frequencies,

00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:31.790
admit these sound-like waves.

00:43:36.210 --> 00:43:38.390
Now heat content-- what
am I supposed to do?

00:43:38.390 --> 00:43:41.620
I'm supposed to take
these frequencies,

00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:46.080
put them in the expression
that I have over here,

00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:49.840
and calculate what's going on.

00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:53.252
So again, if I want to look at
the entirety of everything that

00:43:53.252 --> 00:43:56.800
is going on here, I
would need to know

00:43:56.800 --> 00:44:00.040
the details of k2,
k3, k4, et cetera.

00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:01.830
And I don't know all of that.

00:44:01.830 --> 00:44:03.830
So you would say
I haven't really

00:44:03.830 --> 00:44:06.560
found anything universal yet.

00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:11.470
But if I look at one
of these functions,

00:44:11.470 --> 00:44:17.621
and plot it as a function of
the frequency, what do I see?

00:44:17.621 --> 00:44:19.820
Well, omega goes to 0.

00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:21.780
I can expand this.

00:44:21.780 --> 00:44:25.070
What I get is kt.

00:44:25.070 --> 00:44:29.670
Essentially, it's a statement
that low frequencies

00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:32.030
behave like classical
oscillators.

00:44:32.030 --> 00:44:35.670
A classic oscillator
has an energy kt.

00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:37.840
Once I get to a
frequency that is

00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:42.690
of the order of kt
over h bar, then

00:44:42.690 --> 00:44:50.250
because of the exponential,
I kind of drop down to 0.

00:44:50.250 --> 00:44:54.170
So very approximately,
I can imagine

00:44:54.170 --> 00:44:58.100
that this is a function
that is kind of like a step.

00:44:58.100 --> 00:44:59.950
It is either 1 or 0.

00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:06.330
And the change
from 1 to 0 occurs

00:45:06.330 --> 00:45:10.980
at the frequency that is related
to temperatures by k2 over a.

00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:18.300
So if I'm at some high
temperature, up here,

00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:27.216
and I want to-- so this omega
is k v t sum i over h bar--

00:45:27.216 --> 00:45:29.820
that's the corresponding
high frequency--

00:45:29.820 --> 00:45:32.870
I need to know all
of these frequencies

00:45:32.870 --> 00:45:35.890
to know what's going on
for the energy content.

00:45:35.890 --> 00:45:43.489
But if I go to lower
and lower temperatures,

00:45:43.489 --> 00:45:46.740
eventually I will get to
low enough temperatures

00:45:46.740 --> 00:45:52.980
where the only thing that I
will see is this linear portion.

00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:55.910
And I'm guaranteed
that I will see that.

00:45:55.910 --> 00:45:58.470
I know that I will
see that eventually.

00:45:58.470 --> 00:46:00.520
And therefore, I
know that eventually,

00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:04.145
if I go to low
enough temperatures,

00:46:04.145 --> 00:46:10.580
the excitation energy
becomes low enough,

00:46:10.580 --> 00:46:16.040
it's simply proportional
to this integral from 0.

00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:20.600
I can change the upper part
of the infinity if I like.

00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:31.520
dk h bar 1k divided by e to
the beta h bar dk minus 1,

00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:36.220
And again, dimensionally, I
have two factors of k here.

00:46:36.220 --> 00:46:39.280
Each k scales with kt.

00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:44.640
So I know that whole thing is
proportional to kt squared.

00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:47.155
In fact, there's some
proportionality constants

00:46:47.155 --> 00:46:50.390
that depend on h
bar, t, et cetera.

00:46:50.390 --> 00:46:51.240
It doesn't matter.

00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:55.720
The point is this t squared.

00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:59.560
So I know immediately
that my heat capacity

00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:04.560
is proportional to--
derivative of this

00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:06.723
is going to be
proportional to t.

00:47:06.723 --> 00:47:10.680
The heat capacity of a
linear chain independent

00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:11.900
of what you do.

00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:19.148
So no matter what the
state of interactions

00:47:19.148 --> 00:47:24.380
is, if I start with a situation
such as this at 0 temperature,

00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:28.600
I know if I put energy into
it at low enough temperature,

00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:32.130
I would get this heat
capacity that is linear.

00:47:32.130 --> 00:47:35.360
I don't know how
low I have to do.

00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:39.060
Because how I have
to go to depends

00:47:39.060 --> 00:47:42.520
on what this velocity is, what
the other complication is,

00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:43.860
et cetera.

00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:46.850
So that's the part
that I don't know.

00:47:46.850 --> 00:47:50.120
I know for sure of
the functional form,

00:47:50.120 --> 00:47:53.870
but I don't know the amplitude
of that functional form.

00:47:57.230 --> 00:48:02.540
So the question is, can
we somehow get this answer

00:48:02.540 --> 00:48:05.260
in a slightly different
way, without going

00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:07.240
through all of these things?

00:48:07.240 --> 00:48:12.410
And the idea is to
do a coarse grain.

00:48:20.630 --> 00:48:24.030
So what's going on here?

00:48:24.030 --> 00:48:27.750
Why is it that I got is form?

00:48:27.750 --> 00:48:29.950
Well, the reason I
got this form was I

00:48:29.950 --> 00:48:32.130
got to low enough temperature.

00:48:32.130 --> 00:48:36.660
At low enough temperature,
I have only the possibility

00:48:36.660 --> 00:48:41.260
of exciting emote, whose
frequencies were small.

00:48:41.260 --> 00:48:45.755
I find that frequencies small
correspond to wave numbers

00:48:45.755 --> 00:48:48.520
k that are small,
or they correspond

00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:52.830
to wavelengths that
are very large.

00:48:52.830 --> 00:48:56.200
So essentially, if
you have you solid,

00:48:56.200 --> 00:48:58.710
you go to low
enough temperature,

00:48:58.710 --> 00:49:04.330
you will be exciting modes of
some characteristic wavelength

00:49:04.330 --> 00:49:07.570
that are inversely
proportional to temperature,

00:49:07.570 --> 00:49:10.850
and become larger and larger.

00:49:10.850 --> 00:49:14.240
So eventually, these
long wavelength modes

00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:21.620
will encompass whole
bunches of your atoms.

00:49:21.620 --> 00:49:26.190
So this lambda
becomes much larger

00:49:26.190 --> 00:49:28.423
than the spacing of the
particles in the chain

00:49:28.423 --> 00:49:30.640
that you were looking at.

00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:34.540
And what you're looking
at. low temperature,

00:49:34.540 --> 00:49:40.180
is a collective behavior that
encompasses lots of particles

00:49:40.180 --> 00:49:43.470
moving collectively
and together.

00:49:43.470 --> 00:49:47.605
And again, because of
some kind of averaging

00:49:47.605 --> 00:49:51.880
that is going on over
here, you don't really

00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:55.700
care about the interactions
among small particles.

00:49:55.700 --> 00:49:57.350
So it's the same idea.

00:49:57.350 --> 00:50:00.780
It's the same large
n limit appearing

00:50:00.780 --> 00:50:02.500
in a different context.

00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:05.910
It's not the n that
becomes very large,

00:50:05.910 --> 00:50:10.000
but n that becomes of the order
of, let's say, 100 lattice

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:13.395
spacings-- already much larger
than an individual atom doing

00:50:13.395 --> 00:50:15.270
something, because it's
a collection of atoms

00:50:15.270 --> 00:50:18.680
that are moving together.

00:50:18.680 --> 00:50:21.635
So what I drew here was
an example of a mode.

00:50:21.635 --> 00:50:24.780
But I can imagine
that I have some kind

00:50:24.780 --> 00:50:28.030
of a distortion in my system.

00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:34.250
Now, I started with
the distortions Un

00:50:34.250 --> 00:50:37.430
that were defined at the
level of each individual atom,

00:50:37.430 --> 00:50:41.950
or molecule, or variable
that I have over here.

00:50:41.950 --> 00:50:45.170
But I know that things
that are next to each other

00:50:45.170 --> 00:50:47.930
are more or less
moving together.

00:50:47.930 --> 00:50:52.180
So what I can do
is I can average.

00:50:52.180 --> 00:50:54.300
I can sort of pick
aa distance-- let's

00:50:54.300 --> 00:50:59.050
call it the x-- and average
of all of those Un's that

00:50:59.050 --> 00:51:03.470
are within that distance
and find how that averages.

00:51:03.470 --> 00:51:07.100
And as I move my interval
that I'm averaging,

00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:11.620
I'm constructing this
core function U of x.

00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:20.740
So there is a moving window
along the chain constructed

00:51:20.740 --> 00:51:24.470
with the Vx which is
much larger than a,

00:51:24.470 --> 00:51:28.340
but is much less than this
characteristic frequency.

00:51:28.340 --> 00:51:34.340
And using that, I can
construct a distortion field.

00:51:34.340 --> 00:51:38.390
I started discrete variables.

00:51:38.390 --> 00:51:41.690
And I ended up with a
continuous function.

00:51:41.690 --> 00:51:45.042
So this is an example
of a statistical field.

00:51:45.042 --> 00:51:50.550
So this distortion appears
to be defined continuously.

00:51:50.550 --> 00:51:53.920
But in fact, it has much
less degrees of freedom,

00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:57.680
if you like, compared to all of
the discrete variables that I

00:51:57.680 --> 00:51:58.920
started with.

00:51:58.920 --> 00:52:02.360
Because this continuous
function certainly

00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:05.380
does not have, when
I fully transform it,

00:52:05.380 --> 00:52:08.660
variations at short
length scales.

00:52:08.660 --> 00:52:11.370
So we are going
to be constructing

00:52:11.370 --> 00:52:18.350
a lot of these coarse
grained statistical fields.

00:52:18.350 --> 00:52:20.630
If you think about the
temperature in this room,

00:52:20.630 --> 00:52:24.010
bearing from one location to
another location pressure,

00:52:24.010 --> 00:52:26.970
so that we don't strike
sound waves, et cetera.

00:52:26.970 --> 00:52:31.240
All of these things are
examples of a continuous field.

00:52:31.240 --> 00:52:33.130
But clearly, that
continuous field

00:52:33.130 --> 00:52:38.450
comes from averaging things that
exist at the microscopic level.

00:52:38.450 --> 00:52:41.650
So it's kind of
counter-intuitive

00:52:41.650 --> 00:52:43.930
that I start with
discrete variables,

00:52:43.930 --> 00:52:47.250
and I can replace them with
some continuous function.

00:52:47.250 --> 00:52:50.350
But again, the emphasis is
that this continuous function

00:52:50.350 --> 00:52:53.486
has a limited set of
available and surveyed numbers

00:52:53.486 --> 00:52:56.680
over which it is defined.

00:52:56.680 --> 00:52:57.600
OK.

00:52:57.600 --> 00:53:02.920
So we are going to describe
the system in terms of this.

00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:08.560
So that analog of this
potential that we have over here

00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:13.730
is some b function
of this U of x.

00:53:16.310 --> 00:53:20.730
And I want to construct
that function.

00:53:20.730 --> 00:53:28.280
And so the next step
after you decided

00:53:28.280 --> 00:53:32.290
what your statistical
field is to construct

00:53:32.290 --> 00:53:36.110
some relevant thing, such
as an potential energy that

00:53:36.110 --> 00:53:41.250
is appropriate with
that statistical field,

00:53:41.250 --> 00:53:46.970
putting as limited amount
of information as possible

00:53:46.970 --> 00:53:48.920
in construction of that.

00:53:48.920 --> 00:53:50.480
So what are the
things that we are

00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:55.200
going to put in constructing
this function at.

00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:56.750
The first thing
that I will do is

00:53:56.750 --> 00:54:01.694
I will assume that there
is a kind of locality.

00:54:01.694 --> 00:54:04.390
By which, I mean the following.

00:54:04.390 --> 00:54:08.882
While this is in
principle the function

00:54:08.882 --> 00:54:13.070
of the entire function,
locality means

00:54:13.070 --> 00:54:22.570
that I will write it as an
integral of some density, where

00:54:22.570 --> 00:54:26.190
the density at location
x that I'm integrating

00:54:26.190 --> 00:54:30.790
depends on you at that location.

00:54:30.790 --> 00:54:34.703
But not just you, also
including derivatives of you.

00:54:43.100 --> 00:54:45.720
And you can see
that this is really

00:54:45.720 --> 00:54:50.380
a continuum version of what
I have written here, this.

00:54:50.380 --> 00:54:54.510
If I go to the continuum,
this goes like a derivative.

00:54:54.510 --> 00:54:57.225
And if I look at further
and further distances,

00:54:57.225 --> 00:55:01.250
I can construct higher
and higher derivatives.

00:55:01.250 --> 00:55:07.390
So in the sense that this is
a quite general description,

00:55:07.390 --> 00:55:10.680
I can construct any kind
of potential in here

00:55:10.680 --> 00:55:13.330
by choosing interactions.

00:55:13.330 --> 00:55:18.140
K1, K2, K3, K100 that go
further and further apart,

00:55:18.140 --> 00:55:21.750
you would say that if I include
sufficiently high derivatives

00:55:21.750 --> 00:55:25.300
here, I can also
include interactions

00:55:25.300 --> 00:55:29.980
that are extending over
far away distances.

00:55:29.980 --> 00:55:34.760
The idea of locality is that
while you make this expansion,

00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:36.720
our hope is that at
the end of the day,

00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:40.080
we can terminate this
expansion without needing

00:55:40.080 --> 00:55:43.130
to go to many,
many higher orders.

00:55:43.130 --> 00:55:45.940
So locality is two parts.

00:55:45.940 --> 00:55:48.420
One, that you will
write it in this form.

00:55:48.420 --> 00:55:51.315
And secondly, that
this function will not

00:55:51.315 --> 00:55:56.260
depend on many, many
high derivatives.

00:55:56.260 --> 00:56:00.710
The second part of
it is symmetries.

00:56:07.890 --> 00:56:11.860
Now, one of the things
that I constructed in here

00:56:11.860 --> 00:56:16.120
and ultimately was very relevant
to the result that I had

00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:18.230
was that if I take
a distortion U

00:56:18.230 --> 00:56:27.310
of x and I add a
constant to everybody,

00:56:27.310 --> 00:56:32.132
so if I replace all of my Uns
to plus Un plus 5, for example,

00:56:32.132 --> 00:56:34.320
the energy does not change.

00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:40.690
So V of this is the same
thing as V of U of x.

00:56:40.690 --> 00:56:42.140
So that's a symmetry.

00:56:42.140 --> 00:56:45.220
Essentially, it's this
translation of symmetry

00:56:45.220 --> 00:56:49.200
that I was saying right
here at the beginning,

00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:52.540
that this only depends on
the separation of two points.

00:56:52.540 --> 00:56:54.500
It's the same thing.

00:56:54.500 --> 00:56:59.740
But what that means is that
when you write your density

00:56:59.740 --> 00:57:04.540
function, then the density
cannot depend on U of x.

00:57:04.540 --> 00:57:05.950
Because that would violate this.

00:57:05.950 --> 00:57:08.870
So you can only be
start with things

00:57:08.870 --> 00:57:15.162
that depend on the U of V
IBX this second, et cetera.

00:57:15.162 --> 00:57:16.220
So this is 1.

00:57:16.220 --> 00:57:18.210
This is 2.

00:57:18.210 --> 00:57:20.800
Another thing is what
I call stability.

00:57:24.680 --> 00:57:30.790
You are looking at distortions
around a state that corresponds

00:57:30.790 --> 00:57:36.130
to being a stable
configuration of your system.

00:57:36.130 --> 00:57:40.750
What that means is that you
cannot have any pairs in this

00:57:40.750 --> 00:57:42.810
expansion that are linear.

00:57:42.810 --> 00:57:45.760
So again, this was
implicit in everything

00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:47.620
that we did over here.

00:57:47.620 --> 00:57:49.370
We went to second order.

00:57:49.370 --> 00:57:52.920
But there's third order, et
cetera, are not ruled out.

00:57:52.920 --> 00:57:54.610
It is more than that.

00:57:54.610 --> 00:57:58.590
Because you require the second
order terms to have the right

00:57:58.590 --> 00:58:01.090
sign, so that your
system corresponds

00:58:01.090 --> 00:58:04.116
to being at the bottom
of a quadratic potential

00:58:04.116 --> 00:58:06.200
rather than the top of it.

00:58:06.200 --> 00:58:10.040
So there is a bit more than
the absence of linear terms.

00:58:10.040 --> 00:58:13.490
So given that, you would
say that your potential

00:58:13.490 --> 00:58:18.480
for this system as a function
now of this distortion

00:58:18.480 --> 00:58:23.780
is something like
an integral over x.

00:58:23.780 --> 00:58:26.550
And the first thing that is
consistent with everything

00:58:26.550 --> 00:58:29.960
we have written so
far is that if we

00:58:29.960 --> 00:58:34.740
be proportional to
du by dx squared.

00:58:34.740 --> 00:58:36.860
So there's a coefficient
that I can put here.

00:58:36.860 --> 00:58:39.790
Let's call it k over 2.

00:58:39.790 --> 00:58:41.590
It cannot depend on you.

00:58:41.590 --> 00:58:44.530
It has to be quadratic
function of derivative.

00:58:44.530 --> 00:58:46.520
That's the first thing
I can write down.

00:58:46.520 --> 00:58:50.380
I can certainly write
down something like d2u

00:58:50.380 --> 00:58:53.820
by dx to the fourth power.

00:58:53.820 --> 00:58:58.480
And if I consider higher
order terms, why not something

00:58:58.480 --> 00:59:04.039
like the second
derivative squared,

00:59:04.039 --> 00:59:10.830
first derivative squared, a
whole bunch of other things.

00:59:10.830 --> 00:59:15.090
So again, there's still
many, many, many terms

00:59:15.090 --> 00:59:16.570
that I can't write down.

00:59:16.570 --> 00:59:17.825
Yes?

00:59:17.825 --> 00:59:20.300
Is that second
term supposed to be

00:59:20.300 --> 00:59:22.775
a second derivative
to the fourth power?

00:59:22.775 --> 00:59:24.755
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:59:24.755 --> 00:59:27.740
Thank you.

00:59:27.740 --> 00:59:33.460
So that when I fully
transform this,

00:59:33.460 --> 00:59:40.450
the quadratic part becomes
sum over k, k over 2.

00:59:40.450 --> 00:59:44.340
This fully transformed,
becomes k squared.

00:59:44.340 --> 00:59:45.840
This fully transformed,
as you said,

00:59:45.840 --> 00:59:49.560
is second derivative squared.

00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:51.490
So it becomes k to the fourth.

00:59:51.490 --> 00:59:54.416
I have a whole bunch of terms.

00:59:54.416 --> 00:59:58.912
And then I have U of k squared.

00:59:58.912 --> 01:00:01.190
And then I will have higher
order terms from Fourier

01:00:01.190 --> 01:00:02.550
fully transform of this.

01:00:02.550 --> 01:00:03.100
Yes?

01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:05.820
AUDIENCE: Does this actually
forbid odd derivatives?

01:00:05.820 --> 01:00:08.840
Are you saying the third
derivative and stuff don't--

01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:11.790
PROFESSOR: I didn't go into
that, because that depends

01:00:11.790 --> 01:00:14.530
on some additional
considerations,

01:00:14.530 --> 01:00:17.500
whether or not you
have a mirror symmetry.

01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:20.650
If you have a mirror symmetry,
you cannot have terms of that

01:00:20.650 --> 01:00:22.320
are odd and x.

01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:27.040
Whether or not you have some
condition on U and minus U may

01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:30.580
or may not forbid third order
terms in [? U ?] [? by  the ?]

01:00:30.580 --> 01:00:31.330
x.

01:00:31.330 --> 01:00:35.370
So once I go beyond
the quadratic level,

01:00:35.370 --> 01:00:39.500
I need to rely on some
additional symmetry statement

01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:43.750
as to which additional terms
I am allowed to write down.

01:00:43.750 --> 01:00:44.280
Yes?

01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:48.030
AUDIENCE: Also the coefficients
could depend on x, right?

01:00:48.030 --> 01:00:48.640
PROFESSOR: OK.

01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:50.550
So one of the things
that I assumed

01:00:50.550 --> 01:00:55.730
was this symmetry, which
means that every position

01:00:55.730 --> 01:00:58.940
in the crystal is the same
as any other position.

01:00:58.940 --> 01:01:02.905
So here, if I break and
make the coefficient

01:01:02.905 --> 01:01:06.800
to be different from here,
different from there,

01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:12.020
it amounts to the same thing,
that the starting point was not

01:01:12.020 --> 01:01:13.282
the crystal.

01:01:13.282 --> 01:01:14.740
AUDIENCE: Shouldn't
that be written

01:01:14.740 --> 01:01:16.906
as-- in the place where you
wrote down the symmetry,

01:01:16.906 --> 01:01:21.187
it should be U of x plus
c inside the parenthesis?

01:01:21.187 --> 01:01:21.770
PROFESSOR: No.

01:01:21.770 --> 01:01:22.790
No.

01:01:22.790 --> 01:01:24.270
So look at this.

01:01:24.270 --> 01:01:31.340
So if I take Un and I
replace Un to Un plus 5,

01:01:31.340 --> 01:01:33.600
essentially I take
the entire lattice

01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:36.620
and move it by a distance.

01:01:36.620 --> 01:01:39.380
Actually, 5 was
probably not good.

01:01:39.380 --> 01:01:40.600
5.14.

01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:43.299
It's not just anything
I can put over here.

01:01:43.299 --> 01:01:44.257
Energy will not change.

01:01:49.127 --> 01:01:51.730
OK?

01:01:51.730 --> 01:01:53.840
AUDIENCE: That must be
different from adding

01:01:53.840 --> 01:02:00.140
to all the ends a
constant displacement.

01:02:00.140 --> 01:02:04.230
PROFESSOR: Ends are
labels of your variables.

01:02:04.230 --> 01:02:06.170
So I don't know what mean by--

01:02:06.170 --> 01:02:07.670
AUDIENCE: OK, you're right.

01:02:07.670 --> 01:02:10.130
But in that picture, where
instead of N's, we have X?

01:02:10.130 --> 01:02:10.370
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:02:10.370 --> 01:02:12.161
AUDIENCE: It seems like
displacing in space

01:02:12.161 --> 01:02:13.695
would mean adding up to x.

01:02:13.695 --> 01:02:14.771
PROFESSOR: No.

01:02:14.771 --> 01:02:15.270
No.

01:02:15.270 --> 01:02:17.930
It is this displacement.

01:02:17.930 --> 01:02:21.100
I take U1, U2, U3, U4.

01:02:21.100 --> 01:02:23.760
U1 becomes U1 plus .3.

01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:26.162
U2 becomes U2 plus .3.

01:02:26.162 --> 01:02:27.272
Everybody moves in step.

01:02:27.272 --> 01:02:29.230
AUDIENCE: So the conclusion
is the coefficients

01:02:29.230 --> 01:02:31.280
don't depend on x?

01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:36.030
PROFESSOR: If you have a
system that is uniform--

01:02:36.030 --> 01:02:39.780
so this statement here
actually depends on uniformity.

01:02:39.780 --> 01:02:42.265
This is an additional
thing, uniform.

01:02:42.265 --> 01:02:45.150
So one part of the
material is the same.

01:02:45.150 --> 01:02:47.990
Now, you have
non-uniform systems.

01:02:47.990 --> 01:02:50.730
So you take your crystal
and you bombard it

01:02:50.730 --> 01:02:52.510
with neutrons or whatever.

01:02:52.510 --> 01:02:55.300
Then you have defects
all over the place.

01:02:55.300 --> 01:02:57.220
Then one location
will be different

01:02:57.220 --> 01:02:58.330
from another location.

01:02:58.330 --> 01:03:02.160
You are not able to
write that anymore.

01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:05.820
So uniformity is
another symmetry

01:03:05.820 --> 01:03:08.774
that I kind of implicitly used.

01:03:08.774 --> 01:03:10.526
Yes?

01:03:10.526 --> 01:03:12.570
AUDIENCE: When your
uniform is a separate part,

01:03:12.570 --> 01:03:15.318
why isn't it implied by
translational symmetry?

01:03:19.270 --> 01:03:22.780
PROFESSOR: If I take this
material that I neutron

01:03:22.780 --> 01:03:27.300
bombarded, and I
translate it in space,

01:03:27.300 --> 01:03:33.389
it's internal energy will
still not change, right?

01:03:33.389 --> 01:03:35.384
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:03:35.384 --> 01:03:35.884
OK.

01:03:45.380 --> 01:03:52.160
PROFESSOR: So again, once
I come to this stage,

01:03:52.160 --> 01:04:00.100
what it amounts to is
that I have constructed

01:04:00.100 --> 01:04:13.710
a kind of energy as a function
of a deformation field, which

01:04:13.710 --> 01:04:16.800
in the limit of very
long wavelengths

01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:21.535
has this very simple form
which is the integral du by dx

01:04:21.535 --> 01:04:22.035
squared.

01:04:24.620 --> 01:04:26.190
There are higher order terms.

01:04:26.190 --> 01:04:29.460
But hopefully in the
limit of long wavelengths,

01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:32.525
the higher derivatives
will disappear.

01:04:32.525 --> 01:04:35.050
In the limit of
small deformation,

01:04:35.050 --> 01:04:38.280
the higher order
terms will disappear.

01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:41.230
So the lowest order term
at long wavelengths,

01:04:41.230 --> 01:04:45.670
et cetera, is
parametrized by this 1k.

01:04:45.670 --> 01:04:51.110
If I fully transport it, I will
just get k over 2k squared.

01:04:51.110 --> 01:04:53.770
When I take the frequency
that corresponds to that,

01:04:53.770 --> 01:04:57.590
I will get that
kind of behavior.

01:04:57.590 --> 01:05:02.440
So by kind of relying on
these kinds of statements

01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:07.230
about symmetry, et cetera,
I was able to guess that.

01:05:07.230 --> 01:05:09.650
Now, let's go and do
with this for the case

01:05:09.650 --> 01:05:15.660
of material in three dimensions.

01:05:15.660 --> 01:05:18.800
Actually, in any dimensions,
in higher dimensions.

01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:31.120
So I take a solid
in three dimensions,

01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:34.190
or maybe a film in 2 dimensions.

01:05:34.190 --> 01:05:40.380
I can still describe
it's deformations

01:05:40.380 --> 01:05:46.320
at low enough temperature in
terms of long wavelength modes.

01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:47.940
I do the coarse graining.

01:05:47.940 --> 01:05:49.010
I have U of x.

01:05:49.010 --> 01:05:53.760
Actually, both U and
x are now vectors.

01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:57.310
And what I want to
do is to construct

01:05:57.310 --> 01:06:02.680
a potential that
corresponds to this end.

01:06:02.680 --> 01:06:05.200
OK?

01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:09.860
So I will use the
idea of locality.

01:06:09.860 --> 01:06:13.515
And I write it as an integral
over however many dimensions

01:06:13.515 --> 01:06:14.340
I have.

01:06:14.340 --> 01:06:17.880
So d is the
dimensionality of space

01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:22.620
of some kind of
an energy density.

01:06:22.620 --> 01:06:27.480
And the energy density now
will depend on U. Actually,

01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:32.250
U has many components,
U alpha of x.

01:06:32.250 --> 01:06:38.000
Derivatives of U-- so I will
have du alpha by dx beta.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.650
And you can see that
higher order derivatives,

01:06:40.650 --> 01:06:43.240
they're really more
and more indices.

01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:47.458
So the complication
now is that I

01:06:47.458 --> 01:06:49.270
have additional
indices involved.

01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:58.540
The symmetry that I will use
is a slightly more complicated

01:06:58.540 --> 01:07:01.080
version of what I had before.

01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:05.870
I will take the
crystal, U of x, and I

01:07:05.870 --> 01:07:10.895
can translate it
just as I did before.

01:07:10.895 --> 01:07:15.020
And I just say that this
translation of crystal

01:07:15.020 --> 01:07:17.894
does not change its energy.

01:07:17.894 --> 01:07:19.060
But you know something else?

01:07:19.060 --> 01:07:22.990
I can take my crystal,
and I can rotate it.

01:07:22.990 --> 01:07:25.660
The internal energy
should not change.

01:07:25.660 --> 01:07:32.730
So there is a rotation
of this that also you

01:07:32.730 --> 01:07:34.590
can put the c inside of.

01:07:34.590 --> 01:07:37.450
Before or after rotation,
it doesn't matter.

01:07:37.450 --> 01:07:43.050
The energy should
not depend on that.

01:07:43.050 --> 01:07:45.020
OK.

01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:48.660
So let's see what we
have to construct.

01:07:48.660 --> 01:07:50.080
I can write down the answer.

01:07:50.080 --> 01:07:55.720
So first of all, we know
immediately that the energy

01:07:55.720 --> 01:08:00.640
cannot depend on U itself for
the same reason as before.

01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:02.400
It can depend on derivatives.

01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:05.100
But this rotation
and derivatives

01:08:05.100 --> 01:08:07.140
is a little bit strange.

01:08:07.140 --> 01:08:11.200
So I'm going to use a trick.

01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:19.210
If I do this in Fourier
space, like I did over here,

01:08:19.210 --> 01:08:24.230
I went from this to
k over 2 integral dk

01:08:24.230 --> 01:08:28.600
k squared U tilde of k squared.

01:08:31.710 --> 01:08:35.260
If I stick with sufficiently
low derivatives,

01:08:35.260 --> 01:08:39.770
only at the level of the
second order derivatives,

01:08:39.770 --> 01:08:42.890
if I have a second order form
that depends on something

01:08:42.890 --> 01:08:47.160
like this, I can still
go to Fourier space.

01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:51.390
And the answer will be of
the form integral d dk.

01:08:51.390 --> 01:08:56.979
The different k modes will only
get coupled from higher order

01:08:56.979 --> 01:08:58.939
terms, third order
terms, et cetera.

01:08:58.939 --> 01:09:01.160
At the level of
quadratic, I know

01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:04.760
that the answer is
proportional to d dk.

01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:09.029
And for all of the reasons that
we have been discussing so far,

01:09:09.029 --> 01:09:13.640
the answer is going
to be U of k squared

01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:19.090
times some function of k, like
k squared, k to the fourth.

01:09:19.090 --> 01:09:24.300
Now, whatever I
put over here has

01:09:24.300 --> 01:09:28.300
to be invariant under rotations.

01:09:28.300 --> 01:09:31.029
So, let's see.

01:09:31.029 --> 01:09:34.590
I know that the answer
that I write here

01:09:34.590 --> 01:09:36.324
should be quadratic
[INAUDIBLE] tilde.

01:09:39.050 --> 01:09:41.920
It should be at
least quadratic in k,

01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:43.684
because I'm looking
at derivatives.

01:09:43.684 --> 01:09:47.510
In the same way
that I had k here,

01:09:47.510 --> 01:09:52.000
I should have factors of k here.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:55.760
But k is a vector when I
go to three dimensions.

01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:59.590
U becomes a vector when
I go to three dimensions.

01:09:59.590 --> 01:10:03.120
So I want to construct
something that

01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:07.630
involves quadratic in vector
k, quadratic in vector U,

01:10:07.630 --> 01:10:09.830
and is also invariant
under rotations.

01:10:13.140 --> 01:10:16.340
One thing that I
know is that if I

01:10:16.340 --> 01:10:19.500
do a dot product of two
vectors, that dot product

01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:21.480
is invariant on the rotations.

01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:23.050
So I have two vectors.

01:10:23.050 --> 01:10:26.680
So I know, therefore,
that k squared,

01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:30.710
k dot k is a
rotational invariant.

01:10:30.710 --> 01:10:38.830
The tilde of k squared is
rotationally invariant.

01:10:38.830 --> 01:10:48.230
But also, k dot U
tilde of k squared

01:10:48.230 --> 01:10:51.230
is rotationally invariant.

01:10:51.230 --> 01:10:52.630
OK?

01:10:52.630 --> 01:10:57.290
So what I can do is I can say
that the most general form

01:10:57.290 --> 01:11:03.500
that I will write down
will allow 2 terms.

01:11:03.500 --> 01:11:07.830
The coefficients of that
are traditionally called mu.

01:11:07.830 --> 01:11:09.510
This is mu over 2.

01:11:09.510 --> 01:11:13.540
This one is called mu
plus lambda over 2.

01:11:13.540 --> 01:11:15.992
Actually, I have to put an
absolute value squared here.

01:11:21.080 --> 01:11:26.270
So that's the most
general theory

01:11:26.270 --> 01:11:31.330
of elasticity in any
number of dimensions

01:11:31.330 --> 01:11:38.060
that is consistent with this
symmetry that I have here.

01:11:38.060 --> 01:11:39.990
And it turns out
that this corresponds

01:11:39.990 --> 01:11:43.140
to elasticity of materials
that are isotropic.

01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:55.280
And they are described by
2 elastic coefficients,

01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:58.570
mu and lambda, that are called
[INAUDIBLE] coefficient.

01:11:58.570 --> 01:12:01.840
Mu is also related
to shear modules.

01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:07.000
Actually, mu and lambda combined
are related to [INAUDIBLE]

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:10.380
And if I want, in fact,
to fully transform

01:12:10.380 --> 01:12:17.190
this back to the space, in
real space the can be written

01:12:17.190 --> 01:12:24.500
as mu over 2 mu alpha
beta of x mu alpha

01:12:24.500 --> 01:12:29.170
beta over x, where the sum over
alpha and beta takes place.

01:12:29.170 --> 01:12:32.060
Alpha and beta run from 1 to d.

01:12:32.060 --> 01:12:34.710
And the other term,
lambda over 2,

01:12:34.710 --> 01:12:39.960
is U alpha alpha of
x, U beta beta of x.

01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:44.020
And this object, U
alpha beta, is one half

01:12:44.020 --> 01:12:51.395
of the symmeterized derivatives,
du alpha by dx beta plus du

01:12:51.395 --> 01:12:54.470
beta by dx alpha.

01:12:54.470 --> 01:12:59.436
And it's called the strength

01:12:59.436 --> 01:13:00.250
AUDIENCE: Question.

01:13:00.250 --> 01:13:02.340
PROFESSOR: Yes?

01:13:02.340 --> 01:13:05.360
AUDIENCE: So are
you still looking

01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:08.601
in the regime of low
energy expectations?

01:13:08.601 --> 01:13:09.226
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:13:09.226 --> 01:13:10.890
That's right.

01:13:10.890 --> 01:13:13.130
AUDIENCE: So wouldn't
the discreteness

01:13:13.130 --> 01:13:17.470
of the allowed wave
vectors become important?

01:13:17.470 --> 01:13:19.280
And if so, why are
you integrating

01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:20.580
rather than discrete summon?

01:13:23.340 --> 01:13:24.360
PROFESSOR: OK.

01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:28.850
So let's go back to
what we have over here.

01:13:28.850 --> 01:13:32.140
The discreteness is
present over here.

01:13:32.140 --> 01:13:36.730
And what I am looking at for
the discreteness, this spacing

01:13:36.730 --> 01:13:41.700
that I have between these
objects is 2pi over L.

01:13:41.700 --> 01:13:44.840
The L is the size of the system.

01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:48.183
So if you like, what
we are looking at here

01:13:48.183 --> 01:13:52.814
is the hierarchy of
landscapes, where

01:13:52.814 --> 01:13:57.710
L is much larger than
the typical wavelengths

01:13:57.710 --> 01:14:02.250
of these excitations that are
set by the temperature, which

01:14:02.250 --> 01:14:05.610
is turn much larger
than the lattice place.

01:14:05.610 --> 01:14:08.900
And so when we are
talking about, say,

01:14:08.900 --> 01:14:12.790
a solid at around 100
degrees temperature or so,

01:14:12.790 --> 01:14:17.950
this-- then say, over
here, it typically spans

01:14:17.950 --> 01:14:22.440
10 to 100 atoms, where as
the actual size of the system

01:14:22.440 --> 01:14:24.970
spans billions of atoms or more.

01:14:24.970 --> 01:14:28.902
And so the separations
that are imposed

01:14:28.902 --> 01:14:31.290
by the discreteness
of k are irrelevant

01:14:31.290 --> 01:14:34.134
to the considerations
that we have.

01:14:37.926 --> 01:14:38.880
Yes?

01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:42.090
AUDIENCE: So before, with
this adding a constant c, that

01:14:42.090 --> 01:14:47.542
corresponds to translating
almost crystal by some vector.

01:14:47.542 --> 01:14:48.250
PROFESSOR: Right.

01:14:48.250 --> 01:14:51.610
AUDIENCE: For the rotation, is
this a rotation of the crystal

01:14:51.610 --> 01:14:54.460
or is this a rotation of
the displacement field?

01:14:54.460 --> 01:14:56.790
PROFESSOR: It's the rotation
of the entire crystal.

01:14:56.790 --> 01:15:02.100
So you can see that
essentially both x and U

01:15:02.100 --> 01:15:03.730
have to be rotated together.

01:15:03.730 --> 01:15:05.950
I didn't write it
precisely enough.

01:15:05.950 --> 01:15:10.550
But when I wrote the
invariant as being k dot U,

01:15:10.550 --> 01:15:13.190
the implicit thing was
that the debate vector

01:15:13.190 --> 01:15:16.100
and the distortion are rotated.

01:15:16.100 --> 01:15:19.660
AUDIENCE: So does it require an
isotropic crystal in that case?

01:15:19.660 --> 01:15:21.101
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:15:21.101 --> 01:15:23.200
AUDIENCE: I would
think if you're

01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:24.725
rotating everything
together, who

01:15:24.725 --> 01:15:28.642
cares if one axis is
different than another?

01:15:28.642 --> 01:15:30.350
Because if I have a
non-isotropic crystal

01:15:30.350 --> 01:15:32.240
and I rotate it
around, it shouldn't

01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:33.470
change the internal energy.

01:15:45.230 --> 01:15:46.410
PROFESSOR: OK.

01:15:46.410 --> 01:15:50.880
Where it will make difference
is at higher order terms.

01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:54.970
And so then I have to think
about the invariants that

01:15:54.970 --> 01:15:57.560
are possible at the level
of higher order terms.

01:15:57.560 --> 01:15:58.720
But that's a good question.

01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:02.920
Let me come back and try answer
that more carefully next time

01:16:02.920 --> 01:16:04.470
around.
