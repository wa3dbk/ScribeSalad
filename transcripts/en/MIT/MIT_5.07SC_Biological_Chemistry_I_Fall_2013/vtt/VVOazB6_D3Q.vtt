JOANNE STUBBE: Hi, everybody.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.180
You're in 507, and if you
look at your syllabus,

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.380
you'll find one of the things in
the front page of your syllabus

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.950
is called a lexicon.

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:33.316
And I'd like to
introduce you to why

00:00:33.316 --> 00:00:37.010
we've chosen to have a
lexicon for this course.

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.860
So if you look at this
particular slide or overhead,

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.120
this is what John is
going to teach you

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.650
this semester--
introductory metabolism.

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.756
The glycolysis pathway,
fatty acid biosynthesis,

00:00:50.756 --> 00:00:55.630
fatty acid oxidation,
amino acid metabolism.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.160
A complete jungle.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.600
How are we ever going to learn
anything out of this mess?

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.470
Well, that's actually
exactly the point.

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.120
So what we're going to do over
the course of the semester

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.470
is convince you that
all of this mess

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.050
can be simplified to
10 basic reactions.

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:23.690
And those 10 basic reactions
are what's in the lexicon.

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.060
So it turns out
all of biochemistry

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.530
for primary metabolism
can be described

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.500
using 10 different sets of
reactions and your vitamin

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.060
bottle.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.930
And so if you look at
your vitamin bottle,

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:41.890
what do you see?

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.510
Most of you probably
take vitamins.

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.835
You have vitamin B1, vitamin
B2, vitamin B3, vitamin B6,

00:01:47.835 --> 00:01:49.350
vitamin B12.

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.660
All of those provide
enzymes the catalysts

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.980
for all the reactions in this
complex metabolic pathway

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.430
I showed you on
the previous slide.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.050
They expand the
repertoire of reactions

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.450
that enzymes can
actually catalyze.

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.949
And so within the lexicon,
what we're going to show

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:15.140
you is the chemistry of actually
how these vitamins work.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.060
So again, if we come
back to the lexicon,

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.550
we'll talk about how
carbon-carbon bonds are

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:26.320
made and broken, fatty acid
metabolism, sugar metabolism.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.970
We'll talk about oxidation
reduction reactions

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.200
and the vitamins that are
used for that transformation.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.740
We'll talk about the energy
storage and the energy currency

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.130
in the cell-- ATP, etc.

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.760
So what the lexicon
is meant to do

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.680
is be an aid when you
can't remember what

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.300
does oxidation and reduction?

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.560
You can go back to your
lexicon and look up

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.355
what are the redox
cofactors that

00:02:49.355 --> 00:02:51.060
are involved in transformation.

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.840
And by practicing the
chemistry in the first part

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.650
of the semester of
all these reactions,

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.960
metabolism should be
very straightforward

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.330
in terms of all
the connectivities.

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:07.230
So hopefully what you will do
is look through your lexicon

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.860
tonight, see what
these reactions are,

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.070
and then keep it by your
side during the rest

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.957
of the semester.

00:03:12.957 --> 00:03:14.790
And when you're having
trouble understanding

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.340
some chemical
transformation, you

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.800
can use the lexicon as a guide
to think about the chemical

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.000
transformations that
you'll be looking

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.500
at over the course
of the semester.
