00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.960
JOHN ESSIGMANN: We're
still on storyboard 7.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.570
We're on panel C.
Panel C is where

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.030
I introduced the TCA cycle.

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:29.830
As I mentioned
earlier, respiration

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.090
consists of three stages.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.810
The first is the pyruvate
dehydrogenase reaction,

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.950
which we just covered, taking
pyruvate to acetyl-CoA.

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.210
The second is the TCA cycle,
or tricarboxylic acid cycle

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.970
taking that acetyl-CoA
and basically

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.090
oxidizing it in
order to generate CO2

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.550
but also to produce more
reducing equivalents

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.920
in the form of mobile
electron carriers.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.680
And then the third
step of respiration

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.720
is taking those
reducing equivalents

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.100
to the mitochondrial
inner membrane, where

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.970
the molecules containing
those reducing equivalents

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:05.470
are oxidized.

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.890
And then, the electrons
from that oxidation reaction

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.730
are used to power proton pumps
that ultimately will generate

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:16.450
the proton gradient that can
be used for generation of ATP

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.990
or for generation of
movement or for other things.

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.630
The tricarboxylic acid
cycle, which is sometimes

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.630
called the Krebs
cycle, takes acetyl-CoA

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.750
from several different sources.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.640
One of those sources is
glycolysis to pyruvate

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.030
and pyruvate to acetyl-CoA,
as we've just seen.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.950
And the second
source of acetyl-CoA

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.960
is from fatty acid oxidation.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.720
We'll come to that
pathway somewhat later.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.660
Again, looking at
panel C, the TCA cycle

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.190
starts with the reaction
of acetyl coenzyme

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.300
A, a 2-carbon compound
with oxaloacetate,

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.950
a 4-carbon compound, to form
the 6-carbon product citrate.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.450
Citrate will lose 2
carbons as carbon dioxide,

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.160
and in the process, there'll
be a series of oxidation steps

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.120
that generate three
NADHes one FADH2,

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.110
and one either GTP or
ATP by substrate-level

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.430
phosphorylation.

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:11.620
In terms of the banking
system of the cell,

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.290
the NADHes that are generated
in the mitochondrion

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.430
are exchangeable for
about three ATPs.

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.070
FADH2 is exchangeable
for about two ATPs.

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:22.690
So if you look up
the total number

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.990
of nucleotide triphosphate,
or NTP, equivalents

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.390
that can be produced
in the TCA cycle,

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.260
you'll get about 12 ATPs
for each 2-carbon unit

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.020
of acetyl-CoA that's oxidized.

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.760
As a detailed point,
I want to mention

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.860
that the two carbons
that entered the TCA

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.100
cycle as acetyl-CoA are
not exactly the same two

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.190
carbons that come out
as CO2 in that cycle.

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.160
The carbon dioxides from
the input acetyl-CoA

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.940
will emerge in later
turns of the TCA cycle.

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.610
Now we're going to look
at panel D. In panel D,

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.760
we start looking at the
details of the TCA cycle.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.550
JoAnne explained why
nature uses thioesters.

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.520
The sulfur allows
enolization stabilization

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.430
of a carbanion at carbon
2, the carbon that's

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.630
distal to the coenzyme
A functionality.

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.400
The carbanion is then able
to attack the number 2

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.950
carbon, carbonyl,
of oxaloacetate

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.550
in the reaction catalyzed
by citrate synthase.

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.940
An intermediate is formed,
citroyl coenzyme A,

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.060
which loses its coenzyme
A moiety by hydrolysis

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.300
in a very thermodynamically
irreversible step,

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.850
resulting in the
product citrate.

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.040
This step is at the
top of the pathway,

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.940
and as is usually the case,
this highly exothermic step

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.200
makes the pathway,
overall, irreversible.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.630
Chemically, citrate
synthase does

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.810
a mixed aldol-Claisen
ester condensation.

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.240
The product of the citrate
synthase reaction, citrate,

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.240
is a tertiary alcohol,
and tertiary alcohols

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.670
are relatively
difficult to oxidize.

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.160
The next enzyme in the
pathway, aconitase,

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.280
which is shown in
storyboard 8, panel A,

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.580
removes a water molecule and
then adds a different water

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.850
molecule back to rearrange
the hydroxyl group,

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:08.800
making a secondary
alcohol, which

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.200
is much easier to oxidize.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.010
Looking again at panel A,
the hydroxyl group of high

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.380
isocitrate is
oxidized to a ketone,

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.990
with the transfer of hydride
to NAD+ to make NADH.

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:25.190
This reaction is catalyzed
by the enzyme isocitrate

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.910
dehydrogenase, ICDH.

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:29.470
The intermediate
in this reaction

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.310
is oxalosuccinate, which
is a beta-keto acid.

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.340
As we know from what
JoAnne taught us,

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:40.190
beta-keto acids are prone to
spontaneous decarboxylation.

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:43.000
So the second half of the
isocitrate dehydrogenase

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.090
reaction involves the
loss of carbon dioxide

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.810
in what's usually considered
to be an irreversible step.

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:51.760
I do want to point
out, however, that

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.790
under certain circumstances,
you can re-add the carbon

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:57.160
dioxide in order to
make the reaction go

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.200
in the other direction.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.850
After the ICDH reactions, which
generated NADH and resulted

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:06.970
in loss of CO2, the product
is alpha-ketoglutarate,

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.640
a 5-carbon keto acid.

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:12.190
Take a look at the structure
of alpha-ketoglutarate

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:16.150
in the upper right-hand
portion of storyboard 8,

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:19.990
panel A. If you hold your
finger over the top 2

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.190
carbons of
alpha-ketoglutarate, you'll

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.980
notice that the
residue is pyruvate.

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:28.280
So pyruvate plus an
acetyl functionality

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.580
equals, effectively,
alpha-ketoglutarate.

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.830
Now take a look back
at the mechanism

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:39.200
by which pyruvate is oxidized
by pyruvate dehydrogenase.

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.290
It's going to be a very similar
mechanism for the oxidation

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:44.090
of alpha-ketoglutarate.

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:46.520
The product of the
alpha-ketoglutarate

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.280
dehydrogenase reaction
is succinyl-CoA.

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.740
Again, if you look at the
structure of this molecule,

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:56.420
succinyl-CoA, it's actually an
acetyl-CoA with an acetyl group

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:57.970
put onto one end.

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:01.370
Now let's go back and look
at the alpha-ketoglutarate

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.290
from a different perspective.

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:07.010
I want to make a point here
in that alpha-ketoglutarate

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:09.280
is an alpha-keto
acid, and if we were

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.840
to replace its keto group
with an amino group,

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.460
you'd convert this
keto acid into

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.130
the amino acid glutamic acid.

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:19.670
As with most enzymatic reactions
involving such nitrogen

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:24.440
functionalities, a pyridoxal
pyridoxamine phosphate cofactor

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.950
will be needed to interconvert
the alpha-ketoglutarate and

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:29.810
glutamic acid.

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:33.590
So glutamic acid can serve as
a source of alpha-ketoglutarate

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:36.890
if the cell is starved for
TCA cycle intermediates.

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:38.960
Alternatively,
alpha-ketoglutarate

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.570
can be a source
for glutamic acid

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:45.560
when a cell may need amino
acids for protein biosynthesis.

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:48.280
Now, let's turn
to panel B, where

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:52.370
we'll start with succinyl
coenzyme A. Looking

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:54.980
at the molecule of
succinyl-CoA, note

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:58.280
that I've labeled each of
the atoms with a symbol.

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:00.260
The triangle and
square were from

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.690
the original acetyl-CoA
molecule that came

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:05.100
in at the top of the pathway.

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:07.900
The enzyme that processes
succinyl-CoA is succinyl

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:09.950
coenzyme A synthetase.

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:13.070
As JoAnne taught us,
synthetases are enzymes that

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:15.470
typically need a nucleotide.

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:17.420
In this case, the
nucleotide involved

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:22.550
is GDP in mammalian systems
or ADP in bacterial systems.

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:26.160
In the traditional clockwise
direction of the TCA cycle,

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:32.510
they are phosphorylated to
form GTP or ATP, respectively.

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:36.230
The molecule that you get after
the phosphorylation reaction

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:38.180
in the hydrolysis
of the coenzyme A

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:41.420
is succinate, a
4-carbon compound, which

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:43.790
is also a dicarboxylic acid.

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:46.400
This molecule is
perfectly symmetrical

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.370
and can tumble in
three-dimensional space.

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:52.820
The next enzyme in the pathway,
succinate dehydrogenase,

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:56.390
cannot distinguish one arm
of its substrate, succinate,

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:57.500
from the other.

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:00.650
So if there were a radio
label in the acetyl-CoA

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:03.200
at the beginning of the
pathway, that radio label

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:05.390
would become scrambled
at this point,

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:09.740
uniformly distributed among the
two carbons of the two arms.

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:12.810
From this point onward
in the TCA cycle,

00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:15.890
you will note that the label
denoted as the triangle

00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:19.670
and box is scrambled, as
indicated by triangle divided

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:22.700
by 2 or box divided by 2.

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:26.450
The next enzyme in the pathway
is succinate dehydrogenase.

00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:30.680
This is the only membrane-bound
enzyme in the TCA cycle.

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:33.169
It is a dehydrogenase,
and it uses flavin

00:08:33.169 --> 00:08:35.240
as a cofactor to
help remove electrons

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:37.390
from the succinate substrate.

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:40.100
Flavin picks up
electrons from succinate,

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:44.250
converting FAD to FADH2 in
the mitochondrial membrane.

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:47.720
The product of the reaction
is the alkene fumarate.

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:52.100
The enzyme fumarase adds water
to fumarate to form the alcohol

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:53.670
product malate.

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:56.300
The hydroxyl group
of the alcohol malate

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:59.850
is primed for oxidation by the
next enzyme in the pathway,

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:02.200
malate dehydrogenase, or MDH.

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:07.510
MDH oxidizes malate, which
is an alcohol, to a ketone.

00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:10.490
The ketone product
is oxaloacetate.

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:14.660
The hydride removed from malate
is transferred to NAD+ to form

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:16.010
NADH.

00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:18.320
As I mentioned, the product
of the overall reaction

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:21.740
is oxaloacetate, and
its ketone functionality

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:26.360
is now primed for attack by
the next molecule of acetyl-CoA

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:28.730
entering the TCA cycle.

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:31.850
As a final point, I've
mentioned several times

00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:36.050
that oxaloacetate is present at
a very low concentration, only

00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:38.960
in the micromolar range,
inside the mitochondrion

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:40.880
of a mammalian cell.

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:44.660
So it's always at rather
limiting concentration.

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:47.210
The cell has to work very
hard to preserve enough

00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:51.410
of the oxaloacetate to enable
the next cycle of the TCA

00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:54.960
cycle, that is the acquisition
of the next acetyl coenzyme

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:56.150
A group.

00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:59.810
One of the ways that the cell
can generate oxaloacetate

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:05.060
is by deamination, or
transamination of aspartic acid

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:08.870
to the keto acid oxaloacetate.

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:11.020
We typically have
plenty of aspartic acid

00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:13.220
and this PLP-mediated
reaction helps

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:17.510
to maintain a critical
level of oxaloacetate.

00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:20.390
I want to return to storyboard
7 to make some comments

00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:22.700
about the importance
of prochirality

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:25.190
in some enzymatic reactions.

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:27.170
This short interlude
will help explain

00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:29.730
how to track a radio
label in a TCA cycle

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:32.210
intermediate as that
intermediate progresses

00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:33.830
through the TCA cycle.

00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:35.370
As you will note,
at first glance,

00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:37.980
the label does some
unexpected things.

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:39.440
But at the end of
the day, the fact

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:41.120
that the label does
surprising things

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:44.270
helped early biochemists
figure out mechanistically how

00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:47.540
several enzymes work in
concert during the linear steps

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:49.590
of a pathway.

00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:52.830
We're going to look at
storyboards 7, 8, and 9,

00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:54.300
starting with the
chemical reaction

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:56.720
at the bottom right
of storyboard 7,

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:59.670
panel D. This is the
chemical reaction that's

00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:02.202
catalyzed by citrate synthase.

00:11:02.202 --> 00:11:03.660
You'll notice that
I've highlighted

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:08.220
the two carbons with
either a triangle or a box.

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:11.310
As we have seen, the
nucleophile on acetyl-CoA

00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:13.680
attacks the
electropositive carbon

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:18.260
of the carbonyl functionality
of oxaloacetate.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:22.710
The carbonyl functionality is
a flat sp2 hybridized center.

00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:25.830
So if this were a typical
organic chemical reaction,

00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:29.070
the electrophile could
come in from either the top

00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:32.250
or the bottom, and you'd get
two different stereochemistries

00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:33.360
in the product.

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:36.000
That is the citrate
at the very bottom

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.330
would have equally labeled
acetyl arms at the top

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:41.930
and bottom of the
molecule as I've drawn it.

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:45.480
You would have a delta divided
by 2 for the blue methylene

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:47.460
group, and a box
or square divided

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:50.760
by 2 for the red
carboxylate group in each

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:53.010
of the two acetyl arms.

00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:56.610
Again, these arms are at the
bottom and top of the molecule

00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:58.800
as drawn in the
lower right of panel

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:03.360
D. You'll note, however, that
only the top acetyl group

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:05.520
of citrate has the labels.

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:09.390
Initially, the observation that
only the top arm acquired label

00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:12.350
was a puzzle to
early biochemists.

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:15.090
One way to think about the
citrate synthase reaction

00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:17.970
is to think about the
oxaloacetate laying

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:21.180
on the surface of the
citrate synthase enzyme.

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:25.080
Now imagine that the enzyme
precludes, or blocks, access

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:29.010
to the carbonyl from the
bottom and allows access only

00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:31.290
to the top, giving
rise to only one

00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:34.980
stereochemical outcome, the one
that I've shown in the citrate

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:37.030
to the right.

00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:39.790
Now move ahead to
the storyboard number

00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:43.810
9, panel B. This panel
shows a more cartoon-like

00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:46.390
representation of the
molecule of citrate.

00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:51.070
You can see the acetyl arm
on the top, the pro-S arm,

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:52.600
as having the labels.

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:56.290
And the pro-R arm, the one
that came from oxaloacetate,

00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:58.840
at the bottom, is label free.

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:04.280
So while the pro-R and pro-S
arms are chemically identical,

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:06.430
they're going to be
handled by the next enzyme

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:09.250
in the series, aconitase,
as being chemically

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:11.260
different from one another.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.540
All biochemistry is
going to be occurring

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:16.300
on the pro-R arm,
that is the arm that

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:19.690
came in from oxaloacetate
and not the arm that

00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:23.480
came in for acid 2
with acetyl coenzyme A.

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:25.650
In the bottom right
of panel B, I've

00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:30.400
sketched out an imaginary active
site for the aconitase enzyme.

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:32.670
I show a base
picking up a proton

00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:35.880
from the pro-R arm of
the citrate molecule.

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:38.460
And you can see the elimination
of the water molecule

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:40.600
from the 3 carbon.

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:43.930
So despite the fact that the
citrate molecule is chemically

00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:48.250
symmetrical, aconitase, the next
enzyme in the reaction series,

00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:54.060
is able to distinguish between
the pro-R and the pro-S arms.

00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:57.240
At this point, I want you to
look back at storyboard 8,

00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:00.030
panel A. Look once again
at the citrate that

00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:03.910
is at the upper left-hand
corner of storyboard number 8,

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:07.290
and let's imagine that
the aconitase chemistry

00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:11.500
has happened on the pro-S arm,
that is the one in the box.

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:13.680
Keep in mind that these
experiments have shown

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:15.540
that this does not happen.

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:18.940
This is just a
hypothetical scenario.

00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:21.820
In this hypothetical
case, the hydroxyl group

00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:24.550
would end up on the
number 2 carbon,

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:26.470
the one with the blue triangle.

00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:28.450
You have to draw
it out, but if you

00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:31.720
traced this molecule, in
which the chemistry happened

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:36.280
on the pro-S arm, all the way
around to alpha-ketoglutarate,

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:38.780
you would find out that
the alpha-ketoglutarate

00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:42.970
dehydrogenase would liberate
CO2 from the carboxylate that

00:14:42.970 --> 00:14:44.890
has the red box on it.

00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:48.070
This is in contrast to the
molecule succinate that appears

00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:51.640
on storyboard 8, panel
B. Succinate is another

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:54.460
symmetrical molecule,
but for some reason,

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:58.380
succinate dehydrogenase cannot
distinguish between the two

00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:00.160
acetyl arms.

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:03.200
Because the enzyme is unable
to distinguish the two arms,

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:05.710
in this case, unlike
that of aconitase,

00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:08.680
the radio label would
become scrambled.

00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:10.780
The reason that I'm
belaboring this point

00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:13.660
is because one of the ways
that biochemists work out

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:16.560
the chemical reactions involved
in a biochemical pathway

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:19.360
is by putting in some
kind of labeled molecule.

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:22.750
It could be a radio
label or a heavy isotope.

00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:26.590
And then they trace the position
of the label in the molecule

00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:30.830
as you move from molecule to
molecule along the pathway.

00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:33.340
So label tracer studies are
ones that are absolutely

00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:36.340
central to all of biochemistry.

00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:38.200
And as I mentioned
earlier, you'll

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:40.930
get lots of experience
in the problem sets

00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:44.290
in using labels to work out
the details of a pathway.

00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:46.240
Before leaving the
TCA cycle, there

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:49.540
are a couple of big picture
points that I want to make.

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:52.940
You put in two
carbons as acetyl-CoA,

00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:56.450
deposit them into
oxaloacetate to form citrate,

00:15:56.450 --> 00:15:59.260
a 6-carbon compound,
and then in the cycle,

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:02.770
you lose 2 carbons
as carbon dioxide.

00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:05.530
That means that
there's no loss or gain

00:16:05.530 --> 00:16:07.870
of carbon in this cycle.

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:10.720
If you had just one
molecule of oxaloacetate,

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:13.600
you'd be able to
complete the TCA cycle.

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:15.940
What happens,
however, when the cell

00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:20.470
is in an, let's say, "energy
needed" situation, where

00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:22.750
it needs to buff
up this cycle, that

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:25.270
is increase the number
of molecules cycling

00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:28.660
to be able to accommodate the
processing of more and more

00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:31.510
molecules of acetyl-CoA?

00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:34.450
Those molecules of
acetyl-CoA might flood in

00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:37.530
from carbohydrate metabolism
or, as we'll see later,

00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:39.760
from catabolism of lipids.

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:42.850
Let's look at panel
A of storyboard 11.

00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:45.730
As shown in this figure,
one way to accomplish

00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:49.330
increasing the carbon
content of the TCA cycle

00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:51.550
is to take an amino
acid, such as glutamate,

00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:55.870
and remove its amino group
to form alpha-ketoglutarate.

00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:59.740
Note that if you increase
the concentration of any one

00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:03.580
molecule in the TCA cycle, for
example, alpha-ketoglutarate,

00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:06.160
you're effectively
increasing the concentrations

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:08.920
of all molecules in the cycle.

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:11.290
Because it's a cycle,
many of the molecules

00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:13.450
are in equilibrium
with one another.

00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:17.230
Going clockwise around the TCA
cycle from alpha-ketoglutarate,

00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:19.540
we come to succinyl-CoA.

00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:23.290
Succinyl-CoA is an entry
point into the TCA cycle

00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:26.240
from odd-chain fatty acids
in certain amino acids,

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:27.640
such as methionine.

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:32.020
So these molecules can
give rise to succinyl-CoA

00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:34.570
that itself will then
increase the concentration

00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:37.570
of all molecules
in the TCA cycle.

00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:41.570
Our third primary input
point is at oxaloacetate.

00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:46.930
It involves aspartic acid being
deaminated into oxaloacetate.

00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:49.450
This is a very common
way to increase

00:17:49.450 --> 00:17:53.110
the amount of oxaloacetate
available for the TCA cycle.

00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:56.320
This reaction can dramatically
increase the rate of processing

00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:59.230
of molecules by the TCA cycle.

00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:01.600
Finally, there's an
enzyme we'll look at later

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:04.960
called pyruvate
carboxylase, or PC,

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:08.770
which can take pyruvate in the
mitochondrion, add CO2 to it,

00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:10.864
and form oxaloacetate.

00:18:10.864 --> 00:18:12.280
We're going to
come to this enzyme

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:16.370
later when we talk about
carboxylase enzymes as a class.

00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:21.020
This is an important enzyme in
the pathway of gluconeogenesis.

00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:23.950
So overall, I think you can
see that there are several ways

00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:26.500
that a cell can increase
the overall concentration

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:29.680
of the intermediates
of the TCA cycle.

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:33.700
Increasing any one intermediate
increases all of them.

00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:35.660
And that will increase
the rate by which

00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:38.500
acetyl-CoA molecules can
be processed ultimately

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:40.300
to generate energy.

00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:44.290
The general word describing
this buffing up of the TCA cycle

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:48.220
is anapleurosis, which comes
from the Greek word "filling

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:49.770
up."
