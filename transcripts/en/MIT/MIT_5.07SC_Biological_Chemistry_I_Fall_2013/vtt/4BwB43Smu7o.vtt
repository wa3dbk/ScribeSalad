BOGDAN FEDELES: Greetings,
and welcome to 5.07

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.229
Biochemistry online.

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:34.170
I'm Dr. Bogdan Fedeles.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.350
Let's metabolize some problems.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.500
Today we're going to be talking
about problem one of problem

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.670
set seven.

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.160
Now this is a problem
we are chasing labels

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.240
through biochemical pathways.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.270
Although it sounds
funny, it's actually

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.370
one of the established
ways through which we

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.300
can test whether the mechanism
we propose for these pathways

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.810
is in fact consistent with what
we observe inside the cells.

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:02.690
In part a of this
problem, we're going

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.540
to be looking at glycogen,
and try to figure out

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.210
which carbon's in
glycogen end up being

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.200
lost as CO2 in the
pyruvate dehydrogenase

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.420
step of the metabolism.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:15.890
Here is a shorthand
representation

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.880
of glycogen. As you know
glycogen is a polymer formed

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.440
of glucose monomers.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.170
Here is a cyclic
form of glucose,

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.990
and in glycogen we have
these one four linkages as

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.950
shown here.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.890
Occasionally we'll
have one six linkages,

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.420
as in the case for branches.

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.480
But for simplicity we're not
going to represent them here.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.260
Now we want to figure
out which one of these

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.249
carbons in glycogen--

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:43.790
we can label them
starting from here.

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.800
One, two, three,
four, five, and six.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.390
Which one of these
carbons is going

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:56.030
to be lost as CO2 in the
pyruvate dehydrogenase step.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.280
Now let's take a look at
the pyruvate dehydrogenase

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.370
reaction.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.080
As you remember, one of
the endings of glycolysis

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.080
is the pyruvate
dehydrogenase reaction,

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.910
in which pyruvate loses a
CO2 molecule and forms acetyl

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.250
CoA which later can
enter the TCA cycle.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.290
Now this carbon in the
carboxyl or group of pyruvate--

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.155
I'm going to label
with a red dot.

00:02:21.155 --> 00:02:25.700
This is the carbon that
is being lost as CO2.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.620
So we want to find out which
of the carbons in our glycogen

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.460
molecule ends up being this
red dotted carbon that's

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.160
being lost as CO2.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.330
To figure this out we have
to backtrack from pyruvate

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.550
all the way to the
beginning of glycolysis

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.270
to figure out where this
carbon is coming from.

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:52.490
Shown here is a layout of the
entire glycolysis pathways

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.640
starting from glycogen.
Let me walk you through it

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.440
very quickly.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.220
Glycogen, shown here--
we've shown only a couple

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.040
of monomers attached to
the glycogen and protein.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.670
It's going to get hydrolyzed
by glycogen-phosphorylase

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.400
to form glucose-1-phosphate,
which then mutates to glucose

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.300
6-phosphate shown here.

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.340
And then becomes
fructose-6-phosphate,

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.230
fructose 1,6-bisphosphate.

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:22.730
Then the aldolase
reaction splits it

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.225
into dihydroxyacetone-phosphate
and glycerol-dihy-3phosphate,

00:03:26.225 --> 00:03:27.827
or GAP.

00:03:27.827 --> 00:03:30.280
Then the gap
dehydrogenase converts it

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.540
to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate.

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.490
And then it would go
down, 3-phosphoglycerate,

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:37.880
2-phosphoglycerate,
phosphopyruvate, and finally,

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.080
pyruvate.

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.920
And here, I've also written
the pyruvate dehydrogenase

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:42.770
reaction.

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.460
Pyruvate becomes acetyl-CoA
by losing the CO2.

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:49.700
Once again, this carbon
that's lost, the CO2,

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.500
is the carbon that
we want to track.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.690
So we're going to
put a red dot on it.

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.380
And as we just said, this
carbon is the carboxyl group

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.660
in the pyruvate.

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.080
So the way to solve this
problem is basically go backward

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.760
through the pathway
and figure out

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.870
where this carbon is coming
from in the original glycogen

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.870
molecule.

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.110
For these couple of
steps, it's pretty clear.

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:19.760
It's going to be the carboxyl in
each one of these molecules all

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.940
the way to
1,3-bisphosphoglycerate right

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.290
there.

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:26.240
So now this
1,3-bisphosphoglycerate is

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.560
coming from GAP.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.690
So this carbon is, in fact,
the aldehyde carbon in GAP.

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.460
Now, as you guys know, trios
isomerase interconverts

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.410
between dihydroxyacetone
phosphate and GAP.

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:43.040
So this carbon in
dihydroxyacetone phosphate

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.710
is actually this carbon.

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.490
Because the phosphate group
is going to stay unchanged,

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.820
and then the
carbonyl group at C2

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:57.270
can interconvert with C1
to form an aldehyde here.

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.430
So any of these two carbons,
if they were labeled,

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.340
they would end up
being lost as CO2

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.650
in the pyruvate
dehydrogenase step.

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:12.290
Now, if we go backwards
in the aldolase reaction,

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:17.150
GAP and DHAP, when put
together, these carbons

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.920
are going to be carbons 3 and 4.

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.290
So counting here, 1, 2, 3.

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:27.026
This is a carbon that comes
from dihyrdoxyacetone phosphate.

00:05:27.026 --> 00:05:28.400
And this is the
carbon that comes

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.650
from GAP, so carbons 3 and 4.

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:34.250
And obviously, they're going
to be staying carbons 3

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:39.410
and 4 all the way back to
glucose, 1, 2, 3, and 4

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:40.550
right there.

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:45.770
And also in glucose,
1 phosphate,

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:51.410
and consequently in
glycogen as well.

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:56.330
So to answer part
one, we can now

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:02.150
write here that carbons
3 and 4 of glycogen

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:04.700
are going to be lost at
the pyruvate dehydrogenase

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.510
step as carbon dioxide.

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:14.810
Part B of the problem deals
with the metabolism of glycerol.

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:17.840
As you know, glycerol is
formed by the hydrolysis

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.990
of triacylglycerides.

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:21.830
Now, we are asked
to trace a label

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:24.860
from the C2 carbon of
glycerol all the way

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:27.880
to the first step, in
which this carbon is last

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:29.400
as carbon dioxide.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.680
Let's first take a look at
the metabolism of glycerol.

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.820
As I've shown here,
triacylglycerides

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:37.310
can be hydrolyzed
to form glycerol,

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:41.460
which is 1, 2, 3 propane triol.

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:45.480
Now, as you know, glycerol
is metabolized in two steps.

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:48.050
First, we have a
glycerol kinase that's

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:51.440
going to form a glycerol
3-phosphate, as shown here.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:54.260
And then, we're going to
use a dehydrogenase that

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:59.120
uses NAD to oxidize the
second carbon of glycerol

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.310
to dihydroxyacetone phosphate.

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:06.050
Then it can enter glycolysis
very conveniently right here.

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:07.730
And then it's going
to continue getting

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:11.770
metabolized towards
pyruvate and acetyl-CoA,

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:13.890
as we've seen before.

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:19.470
Now, the second carbon in
glycerol is C2 right here.

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:23.165
I'm going to mark it
with a blue square.

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:28.940
So this carbon is
right here, and it's

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:31.490
going to end up right there.

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:37.230
Now, this second carbon in
dihydroxyacetone phosphate

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:40.480
is going to be the
second carbon in GAP

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:46.150
and then second carbon
here, here, here.

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:48.550
Isn't this fun?

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:50.740
Then the second
carbon in pyruvate.

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:53.700
Now, once the pyruvate
decarboxylates,

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:58.560
then it's going to be the
carbonyl of acetyl-CoA.

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.320
It's this carbon right here.

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:04.270
Now, so far, this carbon has
followed the metabolic pathway,

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:08.190
but it has not left yet as CO2.

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:09.990
Now, what happens to acetyl-CoA?

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:12.520
It's going to enter
the TCA cycle.

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:14.430
Now let's take a look
at the TCA cycle.

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:16.970
As we just said,
we're looking now

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:20.740
at the carbon, the first
carbon in acetyl-CoA

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:24.070
here, the carbon that has
the carbonyl group on.

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:27.820
So as I've shown here
in the to TCA cycle,

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:32.010
the two carbons in acetyl-CoA
are marked with this red line.

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:35.870
And they will enter and
combine as oxaloacetate

00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:37.600
to form citrate.

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:41.440
Then citrate isomerizes
to isocitrate.

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:43.780
Then we're going to lose
a CO2 molecule, which

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:47.140
is this middle guy, to
form alpha-ketoglutarate.

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:49.330
But notice, the two
carbons from acetyl-CoA

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:51.380
are still in the molecule.

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:54.760
Then we're going to lose
another CO2 with this bottom one

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.470
to form succinyl-CoA.

00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:59.290
But once again, the two carbons
that came from acetyl-CoA

00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:00.640
are still here.

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:05.350
So in the first TCA
cycle, none of these CO2

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:10.000
will contain the label that
came from the glycerol.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.880
Now, as we go through
the TCA cycle,

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:15.760
we reach this step
where it's succinate.

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:18.910
Now here, I stopped
putting this red mark,

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:21.730
because succinate is
a symmetric molecule.

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:25.120
So therefore, if
these two carbons

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:29.830
were coming from acetyl-CoA, at
this point they will scramble.

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:32.140
So we won't be able to
tell whether it's these two

00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:35.200
carbons or these two carbons.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:38.370
Now, let me backtrack
and put in the labels.

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:41.680
So acetyl-CoA, we
have this carbon

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:43.760
came from the C2 of glycerol.

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:49.725
So we'll find it in this carbon,
this carbon, this carbon,

00:09:49.725 --> 00:09:51.670
this carbon.

00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:53.920
Now, we get to the
succinate step,

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:57.190
and we said, well, it was here.

00:09:57.190 --> 00:10:00.370
This would be the carbon that
corresponds to succinyl-CoA.

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:02.140
But because this
molecule's symmetric,

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:04.180
by the time we get
to the malate step

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:08.200
to add this hydroxyl group,
it's going to be to the carbon

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:12.100
next to the label or the
carbon further from the label.

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:17.320
Now, because the molecule
is symmetric, we can't--

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:21.612
the fumarase enzyme cannot
tell which carbon was labeled

00:10:21.612 --> 00:10:22.320
and which wasn't.

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:24.377
Therefore, malate
is going to be--

00:10:24.377 --> 00:10:25.960
half of the molecules
is going to have

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:28.330
the label on this
carbon, and half

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:30.220
is going to have the
label on this carbon.

00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:34.360
So I'm going to write like
1/2 square and 1/2 square.

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:37.120
Similarly, when we
get to oxaloacetate,

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:41.770
the label is distributed
1/2 on one carboxyl group,

00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:45.840
and the other 1/2 is going to
be on the other carboxyl group.

00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:51.940
So we've gone through
the TCA cycle once,

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:57.080
and we have not lost the carbon
that came from the glycerol.

00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:00.280
But look what happens
when we continue the TCA

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:02.470
cycle a second time.

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:04.930
So now let's say we combine
with an acetyl-CoA that

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:06.670
doesn't have any label at all.

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:09.310
Now, these two
carboxyl groups are

00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:12.970
going to be these two
carboxyl groups in citrate.

00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:16.510
And as we discussed,
both of these two groups

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:19.310
are going to be lost as
CO2 in these two steps.

00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:22.930
First is the middle carboxyl
group that's being lost here.

00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:25.510
And this other
carboxyl is going to be

00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:29.380
lost at the alpha-ketoglutarate
dehydrogenase step.

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:33.050
So the second time we go
through the TCA cycle,

00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:37.660
we lose half of the label at the
isocitrate dehydrogenase step

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:40.040
and half of the label at
the alpha-ketoglutarate

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:42.910
dehydrogenase step.

00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:44.830
So I'm going to circle these.

00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:48.230
So to answer part B, the
C2 carbon of glycerol

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:51.550
is going to be lost as
CO2 in the TCA cycle.

00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:56.650
But we have to go once through
the cycle first, through which

00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:58.330
none of the label will be lost.

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:00.580
And then the second
time, first in

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:02.410
the isocitrate
dehydrogenase, then

00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:04.180
at the alpha-ketoglutarate
dehydrogenase,

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:06.820
we're going to be
losing the CO2 that came

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:08.905
from the C2 carbon of glycerol.

00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:14.590
As you might imagine,
glycerol can also

00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:16.450
be used to produce energy.

00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:19.390
In fact, some bacteria
can grow on glycerol

00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:21.970
using no other carbon source.

00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:23.680
Now, in part C of
the problem, we're

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:26.290
going to explore how
much energy we can get

00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:28.290
from one molecule of glycerol.

00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:31.990
Let's first review the
metabolism of glycerol.

00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:35.310
As we just discussed,
glycerol enters metabolism

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:38.830
with glycerol kinase,
which then in two steps

00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:40.990
becomes dihydroxyacetone
phosphate, which

00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:44.620
can enter glycolysis
all the way to pyruvate,

00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:46.240
and then acetyl-CoA.

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:51.340
Here, the pyruvate dehydrogenase
allows us to lose one CO2,

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:54.820
and then acetyl-CoA
will enter the TCA

00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:58.540
cycle, where within
one cycle, we're

00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:00.610
going to lose two more CO2s.

00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:03.760
So that's a total of three
carbons that we lose.

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:05.410
And that's exactly
how many carbons

00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:07.210
we have in the glycerol.

00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:09.220
Now, what we need to
keep track in order

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:10.750
to evaluate how
much energy we get

00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:15.070
from one molecule of glycerol
is, whenever we need to,

00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:16.750
use ATP.

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:19.090
For example, we need
to put in energy,

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:23.350
or whenever we generate
NADH or FADH2 molecules,

00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:25.810
then we can then take to
the electron transport chain

00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:28.610
and generate ATPs out of them.

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:31.930
So I've put together a list
of the steps in the pathway

00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:35.170
where the energy
balance is affected,

00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:37.870
either we need to use energy
or we are generating energy

00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:41.650
in the form or ATP or in
the form of redox cofactors,

00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:45.490
such as NAD and FAD.

00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:47.860
So the first step,
glycerol kinase,

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:51.020
we're going to need to
spend one molecule of ATP.

00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:55.040
So I'm going to put a minus
1 here for ATP equivalents.

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:59.350
Now, in the glycerol
3-phosphate dehydrogenase step,

00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:02.950
which is shown right
here, we are generating

00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:06.250
one molecule of NADH.

00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:09.130
So plus 1 NADH.

00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:12.130
Now, for the purpose
of this problem,

00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:14.920
we're going to use the
convention the 1 NADH is

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:19.750
worth about 3 ATP equivalents.

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:22.310
Now, later on in
the pathway, we're

00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:26.790
going to get to the GAPDH step
where we generate one more NADH

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:27.900
molecule.

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:32.910
So GAPDH, another NADH molecule.

00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:34.675
That's equivalent to 3 ATPs.

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:42.000
So moving ahead, we have the
phosphoglycerate kinase step,

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.400
where we generate
1 ATP, and then we

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:48.520
have the pyruvate kinase step
where we generate 1 more ATP.

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:52.920
I have these written here.

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:58.500
So plus 1 ATP, and plus 1 ATP.

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:02.430
Now, finally, we know
that pyruvate, it's

00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:06.240
going to be decarboxylated by
the pyruvate dehydrogenase,

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:08.430
and here, too, we're
generating 1 NADH.

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:19.050
So plus 1 NADH, that's going
to be equivalent to 3 ATPs.

00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:21.510
And finally, the TCA cycle.

00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:25.460
Now, we have one
molecule of acetyl-CoA

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:26.820
that enters the TCA cycle.

00:15:31.001 --> 00:15:33.250
As you guys know for every
molecule of acetyl-CoA that

00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:34.790
enters the TCA
cycle, we're going

00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:40.090
to be generating 1, 2, 3 NADHs.

00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:45.260
1 FADH2, and 1 GTP.

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:54.470
So the tally is 3 NADH,
1 FADH2, and 1 GDP.

00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:57.680
Now, GDP is
equivalent to an ATP.

00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:02.110
FADH2 counts as 2 ATPs,
and NADH counts as 3 ATPs.

00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:07.370
So that's a grand
total of 12 ATPs.

00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:09.890
So putting all of
this together from one

00:16:09.890 --> 00:16:13.760
molecule of glycerol, when
fully metabolized to CO2,

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:17.972
we get 22 ATP equivalents.

00:16:17.972 --> 00:16:19.430
So that's the final
answer for part

00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:21.540
C. From one molecule
of glycerol,

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:24.874
we get about 22 ATP equivalents.

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:31.830
In part D of the problem,
we're tracing the same labels

00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:35.970
we had in part A, but instead
of tracing them to CO2,

00:16:35.970 --> 00:16:39.930
we're going to trace them
to the amino acid alanine.

00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:42.630
As you know, one way
to produce alanine

00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:45.750
is by transamination
from pyruvate.

00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:48.120
Since we already tracked
the label to pyrate,

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:51.930
we need to know how do we
convert pyruvate into alanine.

00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:54.740
Let's take a look
at that reaction.

00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:57.810
As you know, alpha-keto
acids, such as pyruvate,

00:16:57.810 --> 00:17:00.630
can be converted
into amino acids

00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:02.910
by a transamination reaction.

00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:05.880
Here, we're going to
use another amino acid

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:09.810
to donate the amino group to
the alpha-keto acid pyruvate

00:17:09.810 --> 00:17:12.906
to form alanine.

00:17:12.906 --> 00:17:14.530
Now, all these
transamination reactions

00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:19.420
are catalyzed by PLP or
pyridoxal 5-phosphate, which

00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:21.500
is a cofactor derived
from vitamin B6.

00:17:24.099 --> 00:17:27.880
So when it's left to right,
in this transformation

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:30.400
is the other pair
of amino acid--

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:31.270
alpha-keto acid.

00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:34.690
So basically, where is this
amino group coming from?

00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:38.470
Typically for most
transaminases the other pair

00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:44.020
is glutamate
alpha-ketoglutarate.

00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:46.010
So I'm going to have
glutamate is going

00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:48.710
to donate the amino group,
and in the process is

00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:52.520
going to become an alpha-keto
acid alpha-ketoglutarate.

00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:57.140
So in this way, pyruvate
becomes alanine.

00:17:57.140 --> 00:18:04.120
Now, we were tracking the label
from this carbon, so the carbon

00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:07.180
that will be lost as CO2 in
the pyruvate dehydrogenase

00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:08.020
reaction.

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:11.290
So that is this carbon
right here in pyruvate.

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:13.980
So in the
transamination reaction,

00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:19.280
this carbon becomes the
carboxyl carbon of alanine.

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:22.730
So if you were to start
with a glycogen that

00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:25.270
was labeled at the 3 or 4--

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:28.550
the carbons 3 and
4, that label would

00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:32.570
be lost as CO2 in the pyruvate
dehydrogenase reaction

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:35.420
that we saw in part A.
But also, that label

00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:38.660
would be incorporated in
alanine at the carboxyl group

00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:39.580
of this amino acid.

00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:44.950
Parts E and F of
the problem deal

00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:48.930
with tracing labels to the amino
acids glutamate and aspartate.

00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:50.650
Now, both of these
amino acids have

00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:54.920
their corresponding alpha-keto
acids as part of the TCA cycle.

00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:57.470
So let's first take a
look at this TCA cycle.

00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:59.470
Here, we have the
TCA cycle where

00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:03.400
I highlighted
alpha-ketoglutarate going

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:06.870
into glutamate through a
transamination reaction.

00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:09.100
Alpha-ketoglutarate
and alpha-keto acid

00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:12.310
can undergo a PLP-catalyzed
transamination

00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:13.780
to form glutamate.

00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:17.140
And similarly, oxaloacetate,
another alpha-keto acid

00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:21.290
can transaminate
to form aspartate.

00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:23.090
Now, in part B of
the problem, we

00:19:23.090 --> 00:19:25.100
were looking at
the label present

00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:28.300
at carbon 1 in acetyl-CoA.

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:31.010
And we said that
this label will stay

00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:36.900
inside the intermediates of the
TCA cycle for the whole round.

00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:40.670
Now, when this label gets
the alpha-ketoglutarate,

00:19:40.670 --> 00:19:42.500
it's going to be on
this carboxyl group.

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:44.510
So in the
transamination reaction,

00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:46.850
the label is going
to end completely

00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:52.880
on the furthermost
carboxyl in glutamate.

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:55.790
So that takes care of part E.

00:19:55.790 --> 00:19:59.840
Now, if we continue
chasing this label,

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:02.480
once we get to the succinate,
the label is going to split

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:07.130
half and half between
these two carboxyl groups,

00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:11.124
because we cannot
tell which one--

00:20:11.124 --> 00:20:13.040
because the molecule is
going to be symmetric.

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:19.880
Similarly, for fumarate
and in malate as well.

00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:28.210
So in oxaloacetate,
the label is going

00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:30.785
to be on both of
the carboxyl group.

00:20:30.785 --> 00:20:32.410
Half of the molecules
will have it one.

00:20:32.410 --> 00:20:34.540
Half of the molecules
will have it on the other.

00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:36.250
So therefore, the
aspartate is going

00:20:36.250 --> 00:20:40.720
to mirror that label
distribution, 1/2 label on one

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:44.590
carboxyl, 1/2 label
on the other carboxyl.

00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:47.470
So that should answer the
final part of this problem.

00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:49.000
Now, I hope this
problem gave you

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.330
a better understanding of
what it means to chase labels

00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:56.170
through biochemical pathways,
and also that chasing labels

00:20:56.170 --> 00:20:59.170
can help us better
understand the mechanisms

00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:01.020
of biochemical transformations.
