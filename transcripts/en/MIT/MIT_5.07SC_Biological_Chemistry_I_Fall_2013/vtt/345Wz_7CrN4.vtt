JOHN ESSIGMANN: The second
carbohydrate biosynthetic

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.700
pathway we're going to look
at is called gluconeogenesis.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.130
Gluconeogenesis is the
synthesis of glucose

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.500
from noncarbohydrate precursors.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.730
Let's look at Panel A of this
storyboard, Storyboard 31.

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.540
There are some organs in the
body that require glucose

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.560
as their metabolic
fuel, yet they

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.220
don't have the capacity to
make it, or to make much of it.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.030
Examples are the brain, renal
medulla, red blood cells,

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.960
and the testes.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.810
To give an idea of the scale
of the problem the body

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:57.130
faces, we only have about 200
grams of glucose or glycogen

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:01.420
stored away in our body, and the
brain alone uses more than half

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.550
of that each day,
so we don't have

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.370
much in the way of a
carbohydrate reserve.

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.640
The body compensates by having
certain organs, specifically

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.260
the liver and renal cortex, act
as specialized manufacturing

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.320
centers to produce
and export glucose.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.660
The chemical raw
materials they use

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.440
include organic acids such
as lactate, some amino acids,

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.380
and the three-carbon residues
from odd-chain fatty acids

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.600
that enter catabolism.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.730
To get an idea of
how gluconeogenesis

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:32.680
works, let's take
a look at the box

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.560
here at the bottom of Panel A.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.300
You see a muscle working very
hard, as evidenced by the fact

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.340
that it's secreting
lactate out into the blood.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.400
The lactate travels
from the working muscle

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.390
by the blood to the liver,
where the lactate is taken in.

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.240
The pathway of
gluconeogenesis, with energy

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.810
and reducing equivalent
input, rebuilds glucose

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.910
from that lactate precursor.

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.030
The glucose is then sent back
out into the blood, returns

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.750
to the muscle, enabling the
muscle to continue hard work.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.300
As I've described
earlier in 5.07,

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.720
this functional relationship
between a muscle and the liver

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.240
is called the Cori Cycle.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.950
Let's look at Panel B.
Depending on how you look at it,

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.350
there are seven
or possibly eight

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.130
noncarbohydrate precursors to
glucose in gluconeogenesis.

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.522
They're listed in this panel.

00:02:19.522 --> 00:02:20.980
And I've indicated
these precursors

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.350
by numbers 1 through 8.

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.490
The first seven are
not carbohydrates,

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.050
so they qualify as
noncarbohydrate precursors

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.430
as fits the definition for
a gluconeogenic compound.

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.290
The eighth is actually
a carbohydrate.

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:36.660
It's ribose.

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.820
I'm semi-illegally
squeezing it in here

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.450
because ribose acts as a major
gluconeogenesis precursor

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.960
by way of the Pentose
Phosphate Pathway, or PPP.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.080
We haven't covered the
Pentose Phosphate Pathway yet,

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.760
but we'll see, when
we do cover it,

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.870
exactly how this pathway
works to manufacture glucose.

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.120
In other words,
ribose from the diet

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.240
can be converted into glucose
by way of the Pentose Phosphate

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.832
Pathway coupled to
gluconeogenesis.

00:03:04.832 --> 00:03:06.290
A little bit later
in this lecture,

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.560
we'll see how each of
these precursors-- that is,

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.910
numbers 1 through 8--

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.930
are converted to glucose by
the pathway of gluconeogenesis.

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.600
The best way to start
thinking about gluconeogenesis

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.960
is to think of it as
glycolysis running in reverse.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.690
As shown here in
Panel C, glycolysis

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.020
is conversion of glucose,
ultimately, to pyruvate.

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:29.950
As we know, that pathway goes
with a net generation of ATP.

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.020
That is, it is exergonic.

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.990
Accordingly.

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:34.930
If we go from pyruvate
back to glucose,

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.140
we know that in order to make
that reverse pathway exergonic,

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.870
we're going to need
to have energy input.

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.540
As we learned earlier, there
are 10 steps in glycolysis

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.050
going from glucose to pyruvate.

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.370
Three of those steps are
thermodynamically irreversible.

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.890
Those are the steps
that commit molecules

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.490
to flow from left to right,
as drawn in this panel.

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:56.710
The thermodynamically
irreversible steps

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:00.610
of glycolysis are first,
hexokinase/glucokinase,

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.520
that is, the conversion of
glucose to glucose 6-phosphate.

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.760
The second irreversible step
is phosphofructokinase 1,

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.798
the conversion of fructose
6-phosphate to fructose 1,

00:04:10.798 --> 00:04:12.310
6-bisphosphate.

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.430
The third irreversible
step is pyruvate kinase,

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.040
the conversion of
phosphoenolpyruvate

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.149
to pyruvate.

00:04:19.149 --> 00:04:21.579
We have to find a way
in gluconeogenesis

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:25.300
to bypass these three
thermodynamically irreversible

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.530
steps.

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.260
The enzymes that were invented
to circumvent the three

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.590
thermodynamically irreversible
steps of glycolysis

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:34.960
are shown in green
asterisks in this panel.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.240
For example, glucose
6-phosphatase

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.930
hydrolyzes the sixth phosphate
from glucose 6-phosphate,

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.570
converting it to glucose.

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.230
A second asterisked enzyme of
gluconeogenesis is fructose

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:49.690
1,6-bisphosphatase,
which converts fructose

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:54.250
1,6-bisphosphate by hydrolysis
to fructose 6-phosphate.

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:56.770
The third irreversible
step that we need to bypass

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:58.540
is pyruvate kinase.

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.600
Two enzymes were invented
to enable this bypass.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.490
Pyruvate carboxylase,
which we have

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.640
studied before in
several contexts in 5.07,

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.310
and a new enzyme,
phosphoenolpyruvate

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.480
carboxykinase, or PEPCK.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.410
Pyruvate, carboxylase,
and PEPCK work

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.080
in a partnership with
several other enzymes,

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.680
actually in a mini-pathway,
to bypass the pyruvate kinase

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.930
step of glycolysis, and
hence, enable gluconeogenesis.

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.100
Lastly, at the
right of this panel

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:31.450
is a large inverted L. This
is meant to symbolize the 8

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:33.760
precursors to gluconeogenesis.

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.365
These precursors will enter
the gluconeogenesis pathway,

00:05:36.365 --> 00:05:39.160
and flow by the
hatched arrow lines

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.860
all the way up to glucose.

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.490
This network of reactions allows
the conversion of molecules,

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:47.920
such as the amino acid
glutamate, all the way

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:49.490
to glucose.

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:52.270
Now we're going to
turn to Storyboard 32.

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:54.610
Let's look at Panel
A. And let's start out

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:58.130
by looking at the mechanisms
by which the four key enzymes

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:00.190
of gluconeogenesis works.

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:03.980
The first two enzymes, glucose
6-phosphatase and glucose

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:08.170
1,6-bisphosphatase, carry
out simple phosphate-ester

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:10.650
hydrolyses as shown.

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:13.110
The third enzyme is
pyruvate carboxylase.

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:14.970
We looked at this
enzyme mechanistically

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:18.390
back in the fatty acid
catabolism lectures,

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:20.700
when I taught about the
mechanisms by which CO2

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:24.030
can be captured and
added to an organic acid.

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:25.890
Pyruvate carboxylase
will convert

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:27.930
pyruvate to oxaloacetate.

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:30.060
Hence, it's in an
anaplerotic enzyme

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:34.170
that helps maintain the
levels of TCA intermediates.

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:35.870
In the cases we've
looked at so far,

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:40.290
PC helps maintain specifically
oxaloacetate levels.

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:42.370
Refer back to the
lecture on carboxylases

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:46.080
to see how this enzyme works
from a mechanistic perspective.

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:50.340
Now let's look at Panel B.
The last and fourth key enzyme

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:52.650
I want to discuss
in gluconeogenesis

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:57.150
is phosphoenolpyruvate
carboxykinase, or PEPCK.

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:59.730
We haven't seen an enzyme
that works like this before,

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:02.790
so let me go through its
mechanism in some detail.

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:05.490
PEPCK is going to
convert oxaloacetate

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:07.500
to phosphoenolpyruvate.

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:10.260
The enzyme is active in
the liver and renal cortex

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.560
under physiological conditions
that mandate gluconeogenesis

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.030
be turned on.

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:18.060
The enzyme takes oxaloacetate,
which, as we know,

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:19.560
is a beta keto acid.

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:22.500
Thus, it's prone
to decarboxylation.

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:25.950
When CO2 is removed
from oxaloacetate,

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:30.450
you get a transient pyruvate
enolate, which is an anion.

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:33.360
The oxygen anion of
the pyruvate enolate

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:35.250
will attack the
gamma phosphate, that

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:37.800
is, the terminal
phosphate of GTP,

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:41.280
and thus, the pyruvate enolate
will become phosphorylated.

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:46.560
The product of phosphorylation
is phosphoenolpyruvate, or PEP.

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:49.470
Hence, the concerted
action of two enzymes,

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:52.980
pyruvate carboxylase
and PEPCK, enables

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:55.980
reversal of the
otherwise irreversible PK

00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:58.770
step, the pyruvate kinase
step, and allows the cell

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:01.260
to do gluconeogenesis.

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.570
Let's look now at
Panel C. Now that we've

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:05.970
seen the identities of
the eight precursors

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:08.700
to glucose in
gluconeogenesis, and we've

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:11.880
done a little bit of learning
about the mechanisms of some

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:13.920
of the key enzymes
in the pathway,

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.630
we can turn our
attention to a network

00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:18.540
analysis of the overall
gluconeogenic pathway.

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:21.570
The pathway in this panel
may seem a bit daunting,

00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:23.910
because it's pretty
much everything

00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:27.040
we've learned about
metabolism so far in 5.07.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:29.880
So let's go through it
slowly in little pieces.

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:32.760
Let's start over on the left,
where the glucose molecule is

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:36.120
situated in a squiggly box.

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:38.110
Note that the glucose
in the squiggly box

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:40.100
is being sent out of the cell--

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:42.945
that is, it's going in
the opposite direction

00:08:42.945 --> 00:08:45.320
from the direction in which
we have dealt with glucose so

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:46.910
far in metabolism.

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:49.820
Usually, we think of glucose
as coming into the cell

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:51.380
and entering metabolism.

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:53.450
This is a liver
cell or renal cortex

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:55.820
cell that's in the
process of manufacturing

00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:58.400
glucose from those eight
precursors, the ones I

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:01.310
mentioned above, and sending
the manufactured glucose out

00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:02.570
into the blood.

00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:05.060
In this metabolic map,
the hatch lines-- that is,

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:07.040
the lines that look
like railroad tracks--

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:09.380
represent that
gluconeogenic pathways.

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:11.930
Now let's start walking
through the metabolic map.

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:15.040
Slightly to the right of
the middle of the diagram,

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:18.170
you see the amino acid alanine
and the three-carbon organic

00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:19.610
acid lactate.

00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:22.130
Lactate is precursor
number one in my scheme.

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:23.840
The numbering,
again, is in Panel B

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:25.900
of the previous storyboard.

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:28.570
And alanine is
precursor number two.

00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:30.110
Let's start with lactate.

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:33.110
Lactate would typically come
into the liver from the blood,

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:34.580
perhaps from a working muscle.

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:37.240
Think about the Cori
Cycle for a moment.

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:39.680
Lactate dehydrogenase
will convert the lactate

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:43.310
into pyruvate in the liver
or in the renal cortex,

00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:46.130
in the other
gluconeogenic organ.

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:48.110
Let's look next at alanine.

00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:51.500
Alanine, gluconeogenic
precursor number two,

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:53.480
is, of course, an amino acid.

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:57.620
And a PLP-mediated reaction
will convert it to pyruvate.

00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:00.350
That reaction involves
specifically the loss

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:02.660
of alanine's amino group.

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:05.090
Now imagine the
resulting pyruvate,

00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:07.500
that is, from either
lactate or alanine,

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:10.900
translocating to the right
into the mitochondrion, where

00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:15.650
it's carboxylated by pyruvate
carboxylase into oxaloacetate.

00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:19.730
This is the reaction mechanism
we looked at a short time ago.

00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:22.880
Now remember that malate
dehydrogenase, or MDH,

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:26.060
thermodynamically favors
the formation of malate

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:28.310
from oxaloacetate.

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:31.940
So our two molecules navigating
the gluconeogenic pathway--

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:36.590
that is, precursors one and
two, transit from oxaloacetate

00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:38.330
into malate.

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:41.180
Malate is in the
mitochondrion at this point.

00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:43.567
In the next step, it
exits the mitochondrion

00:10:43.567 --> 00:10:44.650
and goes into the cytosol.

00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:48.440
As I've mentioned before,
the transporter for malate

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:50.400
works in both directions.

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:53.150
Malate, now transported
into the cytosol,

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:55.580
can be converted
back to oxaloacetate

00:10:55.580 --> 00:11:00.020
by the cytoplasmic version
of malate dehydrogenase.

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:03.170
The oxaloacetate thus
produced in the cytosol

00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:05.540
goes upward, following
the vertical arrow.

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:08.060
Lastly, PEPCK,
phosphoenolpyruvate

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:11.600
carboxykinase, converts
the oxaloacetate

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:15.050
into cytoplasmic
phosphoenolpyruvate.

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:17.330
Let's pause here for
a minute and review.

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:19.250
Look at where
phosphoenolpyruvate

00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:22.490
is on the metabolic map,
and then look to the right.

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:24.020
On the right,
you'll see pyruvate

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:27.170
on the rightward side
of the one-way arrow.

00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:30.410
You will also see lactate and
alanine, molecules one and two,

00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:32.600
respectively, having
their carbons flow

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:34.700
into the pool of pyruvate.

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:38.270
The pyruvate pool, which
starts in the cytosol,

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:40.880
gets shuttled into the
mitochondrion, where

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:43.580
pyruvate carboxylase converts
the molecules derived

00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:46.370
from pyruvate-- that is,
lactate and alanine--

00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:49.730
into mitochondrial oxaloacetate.

00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:54.560
Then the mitochondrial pool
is converted from oxaloacetate

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:58.370
into malate, which
exits the mitochondrion.

00:11:58.370 --> 00:12:01.194
And the molecules now
represent a malate pool

00:12:01.194 --> 00:12:02.110
that's in the cytosol.

00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:07.710
That malate pool, which began as
pyruvate, alanine, and lactate,

00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:09.960
is converted to oxaloacetate.

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:13.170
And lastly, our
new enzyme, PEPCK,

00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:16.120
converts the oxaloacetate
into cytoplasmic

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:18.060
phosphoenolpyruvate.

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:20.430
All that this was done
in order to bypass

00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:23.660
the one-way step between
phosphoenolpyruvate

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:25.610
and pyruvate.

00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:29.390
In other words, I can go
from phosphoenolpyruvate

00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:32.630
to pyruvate quite easily
by pyruvate kinase.

00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:35.900
But because this reaction
is so strongly exothermic,

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:38.420
I cannot go the other way.

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:40.540
The reverse step
is irreversible.

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:43.130
The mini-network that
we've just navigated

00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:46.550
with all of its steps,
some of which require ATP,

00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:50.150
was done in order to bypass the
irreversible pyruvate kinase

00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:51.480
reaction.

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:55.280
We've just worked very hard
to move atoms from pyruvate,

00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:58.280
alanine, and lactate
into the cytosol, where

00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:02.870
those atoms are now packaged
as PEP, or phosphoenolpyruvate.

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:05.820
Now, let's focus on
phosphoenolpyruvate,

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:10.070
and let it flow backward through
the reverse of glycolysis all

00:13:10.070 --> 00:13:13.240
the way up to the next
irreversible step at fructose

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:15.530
1,6-bisphosphate.

00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:18.770
All of the steps between
phosphoenolpyruvate

00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:22.250
and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate
are common to both

00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:25.370
gluconeogenesis and glycolysis.

00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:29.350
Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate
cannot be converted to fructose

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:34.400
6-phosphate by reversal of the
PFK 1, phosphofructokinase 1,

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:35.720
enzymatic step.

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:38.780
That step is too
thermodynamically irreversible.

00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:43.070
Consequently, Nature invented
fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase.

00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:47.210
We saw the mechanism of that
enzyme earlier in the lecture.

00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:50.690
It allows the conversion of
fructose 1,6-bisphosphate

00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:52.400
to fructose 6-phosphate.

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:56.000
Then the molecule continues
upstream to form glucose

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:56.810
6-phosphate.

00:13:56.810 --> 00:14:00.740
And once again, a
gluconeogenic-specific enzyme,

00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:04.490
glucose 6-phosphatase, will
convert glucose 6-phosphate

00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:06.080
into glucose.

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:09.920
Lastly, the manufactured glucose
is exported from the cell

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:12.530
by the glucose transporter.

00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:16.490
So while it was a long
passage, the carbon atoms

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:19.310
from alanine and lactate
have traveled all the way

00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:20.780
to glucose.

00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:23.150
And then the glucose has
been sent out of the cell.

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:26.180
That is, their carbons are now
incorporated into the molecules

00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:29.210
of glucose that go off from
the liver and renal cortex

00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:32.000
to organs that need glucose
to meet their energy

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.910
needs, or their needs
for the glucose skeleton

00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:37.130
for other biochemical purposes.

00:14:37.130 --> 00:14:40.580
Gluconeogenic precursor
three is glutamate.

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:43.790
This is the amino acid
equivalent of the organic acid

00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:45.740
alpha ketoglutarate.

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:49.250
So look at alpha ketoglutarate
at about 3 o'clock

00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:51.000
on the TCA cycle.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.450
You'll see glutamate
precursor three

00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:57.140
being de-aminated by a
PLP-mediated process.

00:14:57.140 --> 00:15:00.740
This converts glutamate
into alpha ketoglutarate.

00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:02.990
Most of the carbons of
the alpha ketoglutarate

00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:06.710
will then move clockwise
around the TCA cycle,

00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:09.590
and end up at about
9 o'clock as malate.

00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:12.440
Then, as we saw for
precursors one and two,

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:15.740
the malate will be exported
from the mitochondrion.

00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:19.130
And next, most of its atoms will
find their way back to glucose,

00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:23.250
just as we saw with alanine
and lactate earlier.

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:25.680
Precursor four is aspartic acid.

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:29.940
Aspartic acid is the amino acid
equivalent of oxaloacetate.

00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:32.940
Aspartate is de-aminated
into oxaloacetate,

00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:36.360
which enters the gluconeogenic
pathway at about 10 o'clock

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:38.130
on the TCA cycle.

00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:41.940
At this point, the oxaloacetate
formed from aspartate

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:45.570
joins the oxaloacetate made from
alanine and lactate, precursors

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:49.280
one and two, and continues
all the way back to glucose.

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:53.130
Gluconeogenic precursor five
comes from odd-chained fatty

00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:55.860
acids, which are depicted
way over on the right

00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:57.420
of the metabolic map.

00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:59.460
As we have seen,
odd-chain fatty acids

00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:02.130
are catabolized into
three- carbon compounds,

00:16:02.130 --> 00:16:05.970
such as propionyl coenzyme
A. One of the carboxlysases,

00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:08.040
propionyl coenzyme
A carboxylase,

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:11.470
will add a carbon to this
three-carbon molecule.

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:14.610
Then methylmalonyl-coenzyme
A mutase and its partner,

00:16:14.610 --> 00:16:17.040
epimerase, will
complete conversion

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:19.350
of the three-carbon
propionyl-CoA

00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:22.680
to the four-carbon product
succinyl-CoA, which will then

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:25.280
integrate into the TCA cycle.

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:28.650
Succinyl-coenzyme A enters
at about five o'clock

00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:30.390
on the TCA cycle.

00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:34.440
The carbons then flow
clockwise to malate.

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:36.480
Just as we've seen before,
most of those carbons

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:40.350
will flow all the way back
to be built into glucose.

00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:43.620
Gluconeogenic precursors
indicated by number six

00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:48.330
are the amino acids, isoleucine,
methionine, and valine.

00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:51.060
These are, once again, way
over on the right-hand side

00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:52.260
of the figure.

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:55.560
These amino acids are also
converted to propionyl-CoA.

00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:58.080
And just as with the
odd-chain fatty acids,

00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:01.380
they will be converted
into succinyl-coenzyme A.

00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:03.120
Then their atoms
follow the pathway

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:07.660
all the way back to glucose, as
we have seen now several times.

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:09.880
Slightly to the left
of center, you'll

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:12.099
see gluconeogenic
precursor number

00:17:12.099 --> 00:17:14.079
seven, which is glycerol.

00:17:14.079 --> 00:17:17.800
Glycerol is a tri-alcohol
produced from the metabolism

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:19.510
of complex lipids.

00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:21.579
It derives from the
three-carbon backbone

00:17:21.579 --> 00:17:25.800
that holds fatty acids and
phosphates by ester linkages.

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:29.640
Glycerol is first phosphorylated
to glycerol 3-phosphate.

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:31.590
And then that
product is oxidized

00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:33.750
to dihydroxyacetone phosphate.

00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:35.850
We've seen this
chemistry before.

00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:39.240
From DHAP, or
dihydroxyacetone phosphate,

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:42.090
the molecules flow leftward
on the chart to fructose

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:45.390
1,6-bisphosphate, and then
they continue on through

00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:48.290
gluconeogenesis to glucose.

00:17:48.290 --> 00:17:51.140
Lastly, precursor
number eight is ribose.

00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:54.239
We mainly obtain
ribose from our diet.

00:17:54.239 --> 00:17:56.780
In the next lecture, I'm going
to cover the pentose phosphate

00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:57.350
pathway.

00:17:57.350 --> 00:17:59.500
In this pathway,
ribose from the diet

00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:02.570
will enter what I call
the "carbon scrambling

00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:05.300
phase" of the pentose
phosphate pathway.

00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:07.460
Ribose goes into the
carbon scrambling

00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:10.130
phase of the pathway,
and GAP, glyceraldehyde

00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:14.410
3-phosphate and fructose
6-phosphate come out.

00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:17.920
Both of these molecules, GAP
and fructose 6-phosphate,

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:20.860
will flow from right to
left all the way to glucose

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:23.830
in the pathway that I've
drawn out in Panel C. Hence,

00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:27.310
ribose is a good
gluconeogenic precursor.

00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:29.590
Let me summarize the
functional dimensions

00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:32.440
of the gluconeogenesis
pathway from a high altitude.

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:34.780
Imagine that overnight,
as you sleep,

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:36.640
you're not consuming any food.

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:38.840
Consequently, at some
point, your blood sugar

00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:40.300
is going to drop.

00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:43.000
Your gluconeogenic organs,
the liver and renal cortex,

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.490
will sense this
drop in blood sugar,

00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:48.910
and turn on the hatched-line
pathways we've seen above,

00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:52.030
in order to take readily
available noncarbohydrate

00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:55.390
precursors, such as lactate,
alanine, ribose, and so on,

00:18:55.390 --> 00:18:57.970
and convert those
noncarbohydrate precursors

00:18:57.970 --> 00:18:59.570
into glucose.

00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:03.280
The liver and renal cortex
will then send that glucose out

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:05.620
into the bloodstream
to client organs,

00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:10.330
for example, the brain, red
blood cells, and renal medulla.

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:12.190
Ultimately, these
client organs will

00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:15.310
be able to rely on a
constant level of glucose.

00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:19.830
That, in a nutshell, is the role
of the gluconeogenic pathway.
