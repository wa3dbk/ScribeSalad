BOGDAN FEDELES:
Hi, welcome back.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.220
I am Dr. Bogdan Fedeles.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.660
Let's solve some more
biochemistry problems.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.050
Today we're going to be talking
about problem 3 of problem set

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.000
10.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.300
Now this is a problem about the
spontaneity of gluconeogenesis.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.360
As you guys have
already learned,

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.710
gluconeogenesis is the process
by which non-sugar precursors

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.650
are used to produce glucose.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.170
This problem should
help you think

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.750
of the following
conundrum-- in a cell,

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.490
when we have glucose we can
make energy by doing glycolysis.

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.080
But at the same
time, the cell can

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.650
take, for example, the endpoints
of glycolysis such as pyruvate,

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.190
or even further metabolites
like amino acids,

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.950
and use the pathway in
reverse to make glucose.

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.970
Now if one process
is spontaneous

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.820
in terms of
thermodynamics, then how

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.685
could we run the
reaction in reverse?

00:01:20.685 --> 00:01:22.060
So here we're
going to be looking

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.230
at a couple of steps
of gluconeogenesis that

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.690
are the exact reverse
of the reactions

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.510
that you've seen
already in glycolysis.

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.730
And then in the end,
we're going to be talking

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.960
about the whole pathway
level and make some comments

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.770
on the spontaneity of both
glycolysis and gluconeogenesis.

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:50.040
Part A of the problem deals
with the aldolase reaction,

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.790
namely going from
fructose 1,6 bisphosphate

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.410
to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
dihydroxyacetone phosphate.

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.470
Now in gluconeogenesis, we will
be going in reverse, starting

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.050
with dihydroxyacetone
phosphate and glyceraldehyde

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.674
3-phosphate to regenerate
fructose 1,6 bisphosphate.

00:02:07.674 --> 00:02:09.090
Let's take a look
at the reaction.

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.090
This is dihydroxyacetone
phosphate.

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.630
This is glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate or GAP.

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:29.110
And these two come together
in the aldolase reaction

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:39.480
to form fructose 1,6
bisphosphate, or F 1,6 BP.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.890
Now the Part 1 of
the question asked

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:47.020
us to write down the detailed
mechanism for this reaction,

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.320
running in reverse.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.400
So as you guys know, aldolase,
specifically the Class II

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.540
aldolases, use an active
site lysine residue

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.320
to covalently bind
the substrates

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.250
during the course
of the reaction.

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.960
So this reaction will proceed
by dihydroxyacetone phosphate

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.150
binding to the active site
lysine of the aldolase.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.500
Here we have the
dihydroxyacetone phosphate

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.810
and the lysine in
the active site.

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.730
So as a first step
to the mechanism,

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.250
the lysine is going to
react as the carbonyl group

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.720
in the dihydroxyacetone
phosphate

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.932
to form a Schiff's
base, or an imine.

00:03:23.932 --> 00:03:25.390
As you can imagine,
the reaction is

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.570
going to be catalyzed
by a general base, which

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:32.140
is going to remove
one of the protons

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.810
from the lysine, which then
becomes a good nucleophile

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.940
and can attack the carbonyl.

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.870
Which can then will be
protonated by a general acid.

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:47.240
So this way you obtain an
intermediate as shown here,

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:51.070
which can then lose
the water molecule

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:52.750
to form the Schiff base.

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:58.770
Once again, we need a base
that will take this proton

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:05.510
and then the water will need
another acid molecule to leave.

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.880
So what we have
formed here, this

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:13.640
is the protonated Schiff base,
or what we call an iminium ion.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.110
And if you look at it
from the point of view

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:20.540
of where we started from,
which was a carbonyl group,

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.775
this is a version of
an activated carbonyl.

00:04:22.775 --> 00:04:27.620
A carbonyl that would it's
now poised to do chemistry.

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:33.490
Once again, this
is a iminium ion.

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.320
Now as we talked in
the carbonyl video,

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.890
iminium ions are
activated carbonyls

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:41.050
that can now undergo some
of the carbonyl reactions

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:42.730
with more ease.

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:45.910
For example, this one is
going to do an enolization.

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:49.150
So we have highlighted
here the alpha hydrogen

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.080
next to the carbonyl group.

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.910
So we're going to form
the enol by removing

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:58.710
this hydrogen, and the carbonyl
with its positive charge

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.110
on the nitrogen, so it's at
a very good electron sync.

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:06.100
So what we're forming
here is an imine

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.080
that's bound to a double bond.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.170
So this we're going
to call an enamine.

00:05:13.174 --> 00:05:17.900
So now this is the
reactive version

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.430
of the dihydroxyacetone
phosphate.

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:22.070
Now it's poised to react
with the other partner

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:27.170
in the reaction, GAP-
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate,

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:28.410
which we've shown here.

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:34.620
Now GAP is going to be the
carbonyl component of this aldo

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.760
reaction, while the enamine from
the dihydroxyacetone phosphate

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:43.810
is going to be the
enolic component.

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:48.940
So the enol is going to
be a very good nucleophile

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:50.650
and is going to
attack the carbonyl.

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:55.990
The reaction is once again
initiated by this amine group.

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:00.550
The electrons move here and
this attacks the carbonyl.

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:05.140
And we can protonate
it with a general acid.

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:10.120
So what we obtain here
is now a molecule that

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:16.250
has from two portions of three,
is going to have six carbons.

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:17.890
And if you look
closely, this is really

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:20.590
the fructose 1,6
bisphosphate bound

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:24.160
to the active site of the
enzyme as a Schiff space.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.140
So now all that
needs to happen now

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:30.490
is to hydrolyze the Schiff space
and release our fructose 1,6

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:32.530
bisphosphate product.

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:37.880
So, we're going to need
one water molecule.

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:39.820
It's going to be activated
by a general base.

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:45.490
Then it is going to
attack this imine

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:48.100
and the electrons will
move to the nitrogen.

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:56.490
We get to this step and here
we need a step in catalysis

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:01.020
to regenerate the enzyme
to its freed lysine form

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:04.110
and then release the
fructose 1,6 bisphosphate

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:05.920
product of the reaction.

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:09.570
So once again, we started with
dihydroxyacetone phosphate

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:12.497
and GAP and you used
this covalent catalysis

00:07:12.497 --> 00:07:14.580
where the substrates were
bound in the active site

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:17.620
of the enzyme to
form our product,

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:19.900
fructose 1,6 bisphosphate.

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:22.600
Now this, as we discussed
in the carbonyl chemistry,

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:25.310
is an example of
direct adol reaction.

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:27.650
And as the name of
the enzyme suggests,

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:30.990
aldolase this is
the reaction going

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:33.360
in that gluconeogenic mode.

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:38.470
Now in Part B of
the question, we're

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:42.070
going to look at another
important reaction that

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:44.440
can run both ways--

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:46.870
glycolysis and gluconeogenesis.

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:49.600
That will be specifically
going from glyceraldehyde

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:54.190
3-phosphate, or GAP, to
1,3 bisphosphoglycerate.

00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:58.930
This is the reaction catalyzed
by GAP dehydrogenase.

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:03.400
Here is a representation
of the reaction.

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.680
We have glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:11.140
that is converted by GAP DH to
the 1,3 bisphosphoglycerate.

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:12.820
Now in the glycolysis
step, we know

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:17.320
we need one NAD equivalent,
and one inorganic

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:19.600
phosphate to go into
the enzyme to be

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:24.390
able to oxidize our aldehyde
to an acidic anhydride in 1,3

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:26.140
bisphosphoglycerate.

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:27.550
Now in the
gluconeogenesis, we're

00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:29.890
going to be going
from right to left.

00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:32.150
We're starting with 1,3
bisphosphoglycerate We're

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:34.870
going to need NADH
and we're going

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:38.260
to generate GAP and
inorganic phosphate.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.640
Now let's take a closer look at
the mechanism of this reaction

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:44.620
as it would run in
gluconeogenesis.

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:48.730
Here we have a representation
of the active site of the GAPDH,

00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:53.650
where we highlighted
the cysteine group, SH.

00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:56.740
And we also have a general
base in the active site

00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:59.729
and we're going to
call it B. And here

00:08:59.729 --> 00:09:01.770
is our starting material
1,3 bisphosphoglycerate.

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:07.090
Now if you remember
how GAPDH works

00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:10.720
in the direct reaction
in the glycolysis,

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:13.690
we're going to have to form
a covalent intermediate,

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:17.400
in which the substrate is
going to bind to the enzyme.

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:21.820
That's going to form a
thioester with that thiol group

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:23.870
of the cysteine.

00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:27.880
So this is what's
going to happen here.

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:29.670
So the base in the
active site actually

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:33.590
is going to assist the
protonation of the cysteine.

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:35.850
Then the thiol now
is activated and can

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:41.544
attack the phosphoanhydride
of the 1,3 biphosphoglycerate.

00:09:41.544 --> 00:09:42.960
And then the first
step, it's just

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:46.590
going to form a
tetrahedral intermediate.

00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:47.500
There you have it.

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:52.140
Now we have a negative
charge on the oxygen

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:55.881
and we spelled out the phosphate
with all the atoms here.

00:09:55.881 --> 00:09:57.630
As you know, this
tetrahedral intermediate

00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:02.620
is now going to fall apart,
releasing the best leaving

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:03.120
group.

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.750
In this case it is going to
be the inorganic phosphate.

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:07.390
So the electrons come down.

00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:11.630
They're going to be
transferred onto the phosphate

00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:13.230
and presumably protonated.

00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:19.250
So after the
phosphate is released,

00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:24.110
now we have formed finally
the thioester of our substrate

00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:26.480
in the active site of GAPDH.

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:28.310
As you remember, this
is a redox reaction

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:30.770
so it involves
the co-factor NAD.

00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:33.230
In this case, running the
reaction from right to left,

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:38.240
we're going to use NADH to
reduce the bisphosphoglycerate

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:41.760
to the aldehyde group.

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:44.940
So here is our
representation of the NADH.

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:49.430
As you remember, one of
these hydrogens together

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:51.560
with its electron pair,
it's is to be donated

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:55.670
as a hydride or H minus.

00:10:55.670 --> 00:11:01.640
So the reaction proceeds by
rearranging the electrons

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:06.700
on the pyradine ring
of NAD and the H minus

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:08.450
is going to be the
nucleophile that's

00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:10.440
attacking now the thioester.

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:12.490
And once again, I'm
going to be forming

00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:16.670
a tetrahedral intermediate,
which is shown here.

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:22.700
Now this hydride here is
the one that came from NADH.

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:30.710
And in the process
the NADH co-factor

00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:32.580
is converted to NAD-plus.

00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:38.180
So now we can see we're
just one step away.

00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:41.290
This is now like a
hemiacetal like molecule.

00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:43.470
So it's one step
away from forming

00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:45.030
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:47.930
All we need to do is
release the enzyme

00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:50.270
in its original confirmation.

00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:55.340
So the electrons will flow
now to reform the carbonyl,

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:58.310
while the sulfur is going
to get its electrons

00:11:58.310 --> 00:12:03.950
from the base and this
regenerates the enzyme

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:05.630
as we had it in the beginning.

00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:09.540
And we're releasing GAP,
the product of the reaction.

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:11.810
So with this
mechanistic insight,

00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:14.660
we have actually addressed
how the GAPDH reaction

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:18.170
runs in the gluconeogenic
mode from bisphosphoglycerate

00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:19.310
to GAP.

00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:21.590
Now Part A of the
problem also asked

00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:24.020
us to look up the
free energy value

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:28.820
for the aldolase reaction that
is that delta G naught prime.

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:31.340
Now, if you're going to look
in your favorite chemistry

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:36.590
textbook, or I have here the
Voet and Voet Third Edition,

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:39.930
the book that we
use in this course.

00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:43.740
Now you're going to
find on page 511,

00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:46.310
you're going to see a table
with all the free energies

00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:48.010
of glycolysis reactions.

00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:49.430
And for the aldolase
step, you're

00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:52.100
going to see that it's a
positive free energy, that

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:54.960
is the reaction is
spontaneous in the reverse

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:57.590
in the gluconeogenic direction.

00:12:57.590 --> 00:13:00.800
So now that may be a little
surprising, but keep in mind

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:03.830
that the reactions
in these pathways

00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:05.930
are more often
than not, governed

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:09.680
by mass action, that is if we
have an excess of the starting

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:12.740
materials, the reaction would
proceed towards the product,

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:14.570
while if we have an
excess of the products,

00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:16.340
the reaction will
proceed backward

00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:18.120
towards the starting materials.

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:21.480
So both the aldolase
reaction and the GAP

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:23.990
dehydrogenase reactions
are very susceptible

00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:25.470
to this mass action.

00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:28.082
So they will be controlled-
the direction, the spontaneity

00:13:28.082 --> 00:13:29.540
of this reaction
will be controlled

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:31.850
by which of the starting
materials or products

00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:32.440
are in excess.

00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:39.280
Part C of this problem
asked us to evaluate

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:41.440
the spontaneity
of gluconeogenesis

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:43.600
at the level of
the whole pathway.

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:47.140
Now we know glycolysis
is a spontaneous process.

00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:52.570
Not only when it goes
from glucose to pyruvate,

00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:55.530
but also it generates
some high energy

00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:58.030
intermediates like
ATP in the process--

00:13:58.030 --> 00:14:00.920
like we get two molecules
of ATP per glucose.

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:02.950
Now if we want to go
backwards from pyruvate

00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:05.920
to glucose, in a
gluconeogenesis pathway,

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:09.070
can this process be spontaneous?

00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:12.610
First let's look at glycolysis.

00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:15.160
Here is a schematic
of a glycolysis.

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:17.470
We're starting here
from glucose and we're

00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:20.350
going to need a couple
of molecules of ATP

00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:23.620
to activate it, to get to
fructose 1,6 bisphosphate.

00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:26.530
And from there on,
we're going to generate

00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:30.040
actually, two molecules
of ATP at this step

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:34.630
and then two molecules of ATP in
the final pyruvate kinase step.

00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:44.320
And of course, we're also going
to need an NAD- plus going

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:46.860
to NADH here at the GAP step.

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:50.820
Well, there's going to be
two of these NAD-plus needed

00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:54.330
to oxidize GAP to 1,3
bisphosphoglycerate.

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:59.250
And as we just said, even
though we have some energy cost

00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:02.610
in early on, we're actually
generating more ATP

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:05.370
by the time we reach
pyruvate so the pathway is

00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:07.260
in fact spontaneous.

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.920
Now what about gluconeogenesis.

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:12.810
In gluconeogenesis, we
are starting with pyruvate

00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:15.760
and we want to go
back to glucose.

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:18.800
Now if we were to reverse
exactly every single step

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:22.620
in glycolysis, that pathway is
not going to be spontaneous.

00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:27.450
Step four in gluconeogenesis
uses these alternate pathways

00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:29.310
in a couple of
the steps in order

00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:31.560
to make the process spontaneous.

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:34.890
For example, going from
pyruvate to phosphoenolpyruvate

00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:38.940
in gluconeogenesis is not a
reverse of the pyruvate kinase

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:39.690
reaction.

00:15:39.690 --> 00:15:41.145
It rather occurs in two steps.

00:15:44.189 --> 00:15:46.230
So the first step we take
pyruvate and convert it

00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:49.410
to oxaloacetate, using
pyruvate carboxylase,

00:15:49.410 --> 00:15:52.660
so it's going to need
a molecule of CO2.

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:54.630
And oxaloacetate
has four carbons.

00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:58.120
And it's also going
to need energy.

00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:03.090
So we're going to need a
molecule of ATP going to ADP.

00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:09.780
Now oxaloacetate
can now be processed

00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:11.610
inside the
mitochondria or it can

00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:15.180
be taken out of the
mitochondria into the cytosol.

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:18.720
And let's say that's the
course of the reaction.

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:23.010
Where it's going to
find an enzyme called

00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:26.730
PEP carboxylic
kinase, or PEPCK, that

00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:29.670
can take oxaloacetate to PEP.

00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:33.330
This enzyme once
again requires energy.

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:36.570
This time in the form
of GTP going to GDP.

00:16:36.570 --> 00:16:39.120
And here we're going to
lose that carboxyl group

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:42.720
that we added on earlier.

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:47.910
Now while this might seem
like a cumbersome way

00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:53.140
to reverse one reaction,
this allows both the part

00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:56.730
of a kinase reaction and
going from pyruvate going back

00:16:56.730 --> 00:17:00.870
to PEP, to be controlled
in different ways

00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:03.300
and therefore allow
both of these processes

00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:06.510
to happen spontaneously.

00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:12.990
The rest of gluconeogenesis
will have exactly the reverse

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:15.420
of these steps in glycolsis.

00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:18.190
For example, PEP going
to 2-phosphoglycerate.

00:17:18.190 --> 00:17:21.501
2-Phosphoglycerate going
to 3-phosphoglycerate.

00:17:21.501 --> 00:17:24.510
3-phosphoglycerate going
to 1,3 bisphosphoglycerate.

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:28.079
Here, since in glycolysis
we generated ATP here,

00:17:28.079 --> 00:17:33.540
we're going to need the
ATP to come in and go

00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:38.630
to ADP in order to accomplish
this step in gluconeogenesis.

00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:41.154
1,3 bisphosphoglycerate
going to GAP,

00:17:41.154 --> 00:17:42.570
this is the step
we just discussed

00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:45.630
in Part 2 of the problem.

00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:51.150
As we said, we're going to
need NADH going to NAD-plus.

00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:55.410
Then GAP and DHAP going to
fructose 1,6 bisphosphate, this

00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:59.070
is the step we discussed in Part
A of this problem, the reverse

00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:00.990
of the aldolase reaction.

00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:05.040
Now going from fructose 1,6
bisphosphate to glucose,

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:08.400
we're not going to do these
kinase reactions in reverse,

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:11.220
where we would be
generating ATP and therefore

00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:14.430
that would be not spontaneous
in the reverse direction.

00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:17.700
But rather, we're going to
use alternate enzymes called

00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:21.540
phosphatases where we lose the
phosphates without regenerating

00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:22.800
an ATP molecules.

00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:28.800
So therefore, by
using these two tricks

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:32.460
we can go back to glucose
without regenerating these ATP

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:36.910
molecules, and therefore the
pathway can be spontaneous.

00:18:36.910 --> 00:18:40.080
Now the bottom line here
is that both glycolysis

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:42.960
and gluconeogenesis
are spontaneous,

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:46.590
but gluconeogenesis uses most
but not all of the glycolysis

00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:48.930
steps to run in reverse.

00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:51.960
And while glycolysis
generates energy,

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:55.590
we get a net of 2 molecules
of ATP per molecule of glucose

00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:59.670
used, gluconeogenesis as
you guys have seen here,

00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:04.320
actually uses energy
to run spontaneously.

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:07.430
That is, we need ATP molecules.

00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:09.120
Now if you look
at our diagram, we

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:12.060
need ATP molecules
to convert pyruvate

00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:15.080
to phosphoenolpyruvate,
actually 2 of them.

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:16.830
And then we're going
to need more ATP here

00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:19.020
to form 1,3 bisphosphoglycerate.

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:23.210
In addition to the
redox, like NADH

00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:26.200
co-factor, to run
the GAP dehydrogenase

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:28.560
reaction in reverse.

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:32.100
So given these considerations,
gluconeogenesis

00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:35.070
is in fact spontaneous,
but it's going to cost us

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:36.890
several ATP equivalents.

00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:41.190
While glycolysis is
spontaneous and generates ATP.

00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:45.290
Well, that solves problem
3 of problem set 10.

00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:48.180
Here, I hope you got a
better understanding of why

00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:50.790
both glycolysis and
gluconeogenesis are

00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:54.090
both spontaneous
pathways inside the cell.

00:19:54.090 --> 00:19:55.830
Thank you.
