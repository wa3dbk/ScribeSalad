00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:28.210
JOANNE STUBBE: OK, so
welcome to class today.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.280
Today, I'm going to
be talking about one

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:35.620
of my favorite topics--
enzymes and catalysis.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.410
And what I would like to
do is give you an outline

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.260
of where we're going today.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.630
First, we're going to
define what a catalyst is.

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.675
And we're going to focus
on enzymes as catalysts.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.170
Then what we're going
to do is describe

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.780
the theory of catalysis.

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:07.930
And we'll show how
the theory can account

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.960
for all experimental
observations or most

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.480
experimental observations.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:19.000
We'll then talk about the
mechanisms of catalysis,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.030
and we'll see that there
are three basic mechanisms.

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.430
I won't write them out,
but we'll come to them.

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.800
And then if time allows, we'll
talk about another property

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:30.490
of enzymes.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:36.330
These are all focused with
amazing rates of reaction.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.700
And the second
property of enzymes,

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.180
besides the fact that they
can accelerate reactions

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.860
by a million to a billion
fold, is their specificity.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.910
So that's where we're going.

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.530
And what I'd like to do
in the very beginning

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.430
is show you why--
spend a little time

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.400
to show you why
enzymes are important.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.590
Why do you care about enzymes?

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.090
That's why you
care about enzymes.

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.620
Look at this mess.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.530
That's what's going
on inside your body.

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.970
There are thousands of reactions
going on inside your body.

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.980
Without enzymes, no reaction.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.800
So you must care about enzymes.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.970
So what we're going to see
over the course of the semester

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.490
is that we can
break down this mess

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.070
into a few basic reactions.

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.670
OK, so here is Waldo.

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.710
And over the course
of this semester,

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:50.350
as you've seen many times, we
walk through central metabolism

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.630
and all of the reactions.

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.000
Now, a second
thing about enzymes

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.130
that I think will be what
you guys do for a living

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.310
if you decide to become
biochemists and enzymologists

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.660
is can we take our understanding
of how these amazing catalysts

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.620
work and design our
own protein catalysts

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.700
to do any reactions we
want not involved in the 10

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.930
or 12 basic reactions we have
going on inside our body?

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.390
And we can't do that
now, but I would

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.890
argue that understanding
catalysis is a key requirement

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.840
for getting to the point
where we can actually

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.970
do catalytic design.

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.460
And the third thing that I
think is really important

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:38.560
is that 40% to 50% of all
the drugs we presently

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.280
use in treatment of
antibacterial infections,

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.130
anti-viral infections,
anti-cancer infections

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.390
are all inhibitors of
enzyme-based reactions.

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.420
And understanding
catalysis helps

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.880
us to design better inhibitors.

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.560
So understanding catalysis
is central to many things

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.090
that are important to
all of us in society.

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.780
So let me just tell you how
I got excited about enzymes.

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.210
So I went to graduate school.

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:12.190
Never had a biochemistry course.

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.890
They didn't do anything
about biochemistry

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:17.350
at the molecular level.

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.870
When I went to graduate
school, I went to a lecture

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.540
in the first year
of graduate school

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.240
that was given by a
faculty member at Stanford.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:31.270
And he talked about an enzyme
called lenosterol cyclase that

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.270
converts a linear molecule.

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.030
So here's the linear
molecule, but I have

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.470
it folded up into four rings.

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.480
And these four rings
provide the basis

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.810
for all steroids like
estrogen and testosterone

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:47.710
and cholesterol.

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.990
And look at what
this reaction does.

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:56.290
One enzyme in a single step
converts this linear molecule

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:00.340
through a series of cascade
transformations in hydride

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.760
and methyl shifts
into this molecule,

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.650
putting in six
asymmetric centers

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:14.070
in a single step in 100%
yield at 37 degrees in a pH 7.

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.980
I said, my god, why do
I want to be a chemist?

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:17.754
You sweat.

00:05:17.754 --> 00:05:19.170
There are no
blocking [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:22.920
You to sweat to put in any
kind of an asymmetric center,

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:26.120
and here, this little
protein has figured out

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:32.050
how to do all of this under
really mild conditions.

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:35.310
And so this was a transformative
experience for me.

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:39.060
I remember the lecture
clearly because I thought

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.520
it was so amazing and I'd
never seen that enzymes could

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.890
catalyze reactions like this.

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:48.210
So enzymes really are amazing.

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:51.600
So what you want
to do now is start

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.790
by defining what a catalyst is.

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:03.870
And a catalyst, it can
be for those of you who

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:05.580
have had more
chemistry, it can be

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:08.880
an inorganic ion for example.

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.750
It can be a small
organic molecule.

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:14.430
But for us, we're
going to be focused

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:18.140
on large macromolecules.

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:21.810
And the macromolecules,
we'll see

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:25.590
that we're getting focused
on, could be proteins or RNA.

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:28.140
But most of the reactions
found in our body

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:32.250
are catalyzed by
protein catalysts.

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:43.050
And these catalysts increase
the rate of the reaction

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:46.177
without themselves being
changed during the reaction.

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:55.580
And furthermore, while
they can increase

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:57.410
the rate of the
reaction, they don't

00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:01.160
affect the overall
equilibrium of the reaction.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:05.180
They just increase the rate
of approach to equilibrium.

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:16.530
So they have no effect on
equilibrium insolution,

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:22.424
but increase the rate of
approach to equilibrium.

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:30.500
So what I want to
do now is define

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:33.920
some of the basic
properties of the catalysts

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:38.690
that we'll be talking about
for the next 15 minutes or so.

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:41.330
So the first thing is that
the catalysts we're going

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:44.972
to be focused on are enzymes.

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:50.060
Remember, we've spent
the last few lectures

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:51.350
talking about proteins.

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:54.080
Enzymes are simply
proteins, but then we

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:57.140
see that they have special
regions in the protein

00:07:57.140 --> 00:08:01.370
structure which allow
them to accelerate

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:04.670
rates of defined reactions.

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:09.920
I also will mention that
we have inside of us

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:12.370
a machine called the ribosome.

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:18.700
And the ribozome is the machine
that makes proteins, makes

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:21.020
polypeptide bonds.

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:22.940
We're not going to
talk about that in 507,

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:25.970
but we talk about it in 508.

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:29.960
And the amazing observation
was made really initially

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:34.350
by the seminal experiments by
Harry Knoller at UC Santa Cruz

00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:38.240
that you don't need any
proteins to make peptide bonds.

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.669
That was heresy at the time.

00:08:40.669 --> 00:08:44.300
In 2001, Steitz
won the Nobel Prize

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:46.880
for the structure of
the ribosome and Harry

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:50.120
didn't get the Nobel Prize.

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:50.810
Bad.

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:54.170
He's the one that made
the seminal discovery,

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:56.030
although the structure
of a ribosome,

00:08:56.030 --> 00:09:01.370
which is 2.3 megadaltons, is
really sort of spectacular.

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:04.610
I still get goosebumps when I
think about that structure that

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:06.470
was published in 2001.

00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:07.880
But Harry didn't get it.

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:09.710
Anyhow, so that
was a digression.

00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:12.760
So that took a few
minutes off my 50 minutes.

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:15.170
Anyhow, we're
going to be focused

00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:17.980
on enzymes as catalysts.

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:21.770
So why are enzymes important.

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:24.410
They're important because
as I already told you,

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:31.080
they accelerate the
rates of reaction 10

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:38.330
to the 6-- a million--
to 10 to the 15-fold.

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:39.260
Whoa.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:41.160
Can you imagine that?

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.980
Essigmann always used to say
to me, give them an example.

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:45.200
That's a lot.

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:49.316
It's faster than
a speeding bullet.

00:09:49.316 --> 00:09:50.690
Do you know where
that came from?

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:52.990
Faster than a speeding bullet?

00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:57.650
See, if this is when I have a
disconnection with my audience.

00:09:57.650 --> 00:10:02.090
It's a bird, it's a plane,
able to leap tall buildings

00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:04.180
in a single bound.

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:07.310
Superman, course five.

00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:10.190
That's where our course
five logo came from.

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:13.610
So let me just give
you an example of this.

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:17.780
And so this is taken from
an article by Wolfenden,

00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:22.230
and this is the
expanse of reactions

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:26.630
that it rates that enzymes
can catalyze that also

00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:28.740
can occur in solution.

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:34.560
So if you take down at this
end a half life of adding water

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:37.760
to CO2 is five seconds.

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:39.380
That's pretty fast.

00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:43.040
Why do you need
water to hydrate CO2?

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:45.410
Anybody got any ideas?

00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:48.760
Where have you seen that
in the last few lectures?

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:50.150
Hemoglobin.

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:51.140
Why do you need that?

00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:56.420
Because in your tissues, all of
the fatty acids of the glucose

00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:57.970
gets breakdown to CO2.

00:10:57.970 --> 00:11:00.720
The CO2, where does it come out?

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:01.910
You exhale it.

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:06.860
Somehow it has to be carried
around and into your lungs

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:08.500
from your tissues.

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:11.970
And there's a key enzyme
called carbonic anhydrase

00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:16.145
that accelerates even this
very fast reaction by a million

00:11:16.145 --> 00:11:16.645
fold.

00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:21.680
Let's look at another one
that might be familiar to you.

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:24.290
Let's think about
peptide bond hydrolysis.

00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:28.040
We just told you the
ribosome makes peptides.

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:30.320
What about peptide
bond hydrolysis, which

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:37.520
plays a major role in cell media
death and blood coagulation

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:41.090
and controlling the levels
of proteins inside the cell?

00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:44.660
If you look at the half
life of peptide bond

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:47.900
hydrolysis, 450 years.

00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:50.360
That means if we needed this
reaction in our lifetime,

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:52.490
it wouldn't ever happen.

00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:55.990
So if you actually look
at the rate acceleration,

00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:59.690
proteases, which
hydrolyze peptide bonds,

00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:02.420
have rate constants of
about 50 per second.

00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:05.940
This rate constant is about
10 to the minus 9 per second.

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:09.110
That's the rate acceleration
of 10 to the 12.

00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:11.510
So without these
kinds of enzymes

00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:14.610
and many other kinds of
enzymes, we would not be alive

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:17.390
and we would not be
able to function.

00:12:17.390 --> 00:12:23.150
So the description
of rate accelerations

00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:28.370
is given by a term we're going
to derive in the next lecture--

00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:31.175
kcat over KM.

00:12:31.175 --> 00:12:33.220
A kcat is a turnover number.

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:35.920
It tells you how good your
catalyst is in terms of per

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:36.890
second.

00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:41.250
KM has a concentration
dependence.

00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:46.160
So this is a second order
rate constant-- concentration

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:50.730
inverse, time inverse.

00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:54.410
And this is what we use to think
about how efficient enzymes

00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:57.240
are, as we'll see
in the next lecture.

00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:00.800
So what I want to show
you here is another graph

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:05.930
that was made by Wolfenden,
who we were talking about data

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:07.670
in the previous slide.

00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:10.760
And what I want to do is
show you his comparison

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:13.620
of enzyme catalyzed
reactions and

00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:15.510
non-enzyme catalyzed reactions.

00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:20.060
And we just heard with peptide
bond hydrolysis, 450-fold rate

00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:20.880
acceleration.

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:22.040
That's a lot.

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:23.750
What do you notice
immediately about

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:26.300
enzyme catalyzed reactions?

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:37.570
The kcat over KM is on the order
of 10 to the 6 to 10 to the 8

00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:40.640
per molar per second.

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:43.310
Does that ring a
bell with anybody?

00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:46.490
Where have you seen a number
like 10 to the 6 to 10 to the 8

00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:48.240
per molar per second?

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:53.480
What that is is a diffusion
constant of any two molecules

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:55.370
finding each other in solution.

00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:57.500
So what is that telling us?

00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:03.210
That's telling us
that inside the cell,

00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:07.280
enzymes have evolved
to be so efficient

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:09.170
that the rate-limiting
steps are going to be

00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:10.520
finding each other in solution.

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:11.230
It's physical.

00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:13.500
It has nothing to do
with the chemistry.

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:15.800
So you've had billions
of years to figure out

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:18.832
all this chemistry, and
what limits everything--

00:14:18.832 --> 00:14:20.540
and we'll come back
to this in a minute--

00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:25.410
is the enzyme and the small
molecule finding themselves.

00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:28.020
And so that's where this
number-- of 10 to the 6 or 10

00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:30.410
to the 8 per molar
per second comes from.

00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:33.530
If you look at the
non-enzymatic reactions,

00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:35.850
we just talked about
hydration of CO2

00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:38.270
versus enzyme
catalyzed reaction,

00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:42.020
what you see is that
they're all over the place.

00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:46.010
So the staggering
rate accelerations

00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:49.710
of 10 to the 6 to 10
to the 15 that you see

00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:54.980
are really based on the rates
of the non-enzymatic reactions.

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:57.140
And the enzymes have
evolved-- most of them

00:14:57.140 --> 00:14:59.730
have evolved over
billions of years

00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:03.360
to be incredibly
effective at what they do.

00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:11.970
So the other thing that I
wanted to say about enzymes

00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:16.520
at this stage is that
enzymes are usually

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:19.490
in addition to being
great catalysts,

00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:24.050
they're also-- you learn, I
think, if you've seen enzymes

00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:34.370
before that they are very
specific for the substrates,

00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:38.040
which I'll call S and we'll
come back to this in a minute.

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:41.220
So they only react-- you
have hundreds of metabolites

00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:42.270
inside of our body.

00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:46.790
That only will pick up and react
with one of those metabolites.

00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:50.540
But in reality, I think what
we found over the last 15 years

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:53.960
or so is enzymes are
not all that specific.

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:58.130
They are specific for what
they encounter inside us.

00:15:58.130 --> 00:16:00.140
So if you take them
out as a biochemist

00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:01.950
and start messing
around with them,

00:16:01.950 --> 00:16:03.800
they aren't anywhere
near as specific.

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:06.960
They don't have to be that
specific because they never

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:10.470
encounter these molecules
inside the cell.

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:16.250
So they are very specific
for substrates in vivo.

00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:19.980
And in fact, many of them
are promiscuous in vitro.

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:22.740
And I think that's something
that's been under-appreciated.

00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:30.480
So this is number three.

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:32.730
I wanted to talk
about specificity.

00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:37.310
Number four, enzymes
in general, if you

00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:41.480
look at that metabolic chart,
almost all those reactions

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:45.020
can be subdivided into
10 to 12 reactions.

00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:47.120
And those 10 to
12 reactions, even

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:49.670
though it looks like
a jungle and a mess,

00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:52.950
are found in the lexicon
that you have been

00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:55.230
given in the first lecture.

00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:59.890
So that lexicon provides a
framework to think about all

00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:01.710
of primary metabolism.

00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:04.980
Now, in reality, there are
many other kinds of reactions.

00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:09.359
But the ones that you're
going to see in 507

00:17:09.359 --> 00:17:12.660
can be limited to
10 to 12 reactions.

00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:29.270
So enzymes have a limited
repertoire of reactions

00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:30.415
in primary metabolism.

00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:38.740
And so in this case, let me
give a plug for the chemists.

00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:40.690
Chemists have the
whole periodic table.

00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:42.590
Do we have a
periodic table here?

00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:43.180
No.

00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:44.430
We're in the wrong department.

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:45.760
We're in the wrong building.

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:48.390
Anyhow, we have
hundreds-- not hundreds--

00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:52.800
we have 50 elements where we
can use to catalyze reactions.

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:56.440
We can do all kinds of
reactions catalytically,

00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:58.560
and we can do it
with something small,

00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:01.240
like a proton, or
something small,

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:05.440
like a metal with a little
organic spinach hanging off

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:06.220
of it.

00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:07.690
But what are we
doing with enzymes?

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:10.580
We have these big
huge molecules.

00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:11.640
So there's a playoff.

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:15.220
Enzymes have a very
limited repertoire

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:19.990
of reactions they catalyze,
while chemists actually

00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:24.300
are limited by their imagination
to catalyze these reactions.

00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:28.350
However, as the world
becomes more and more green,

00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:31.480
chemists are no longer
allowed to use metals.

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:34.510
For example, they can
be toxic to people.

00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:37.800
And so people are
rethinking and refocusing

00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:41.580
on developing green catalysts.

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:43.550
So the question that
you can ask yourself,

00:18:43.550 --> 00:18:47.020
is there any way
that enzymes can

00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:49.660
enhance their
repertoire of reactions

00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:51.360
that they can catalyze?

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:53.306
And they can.

00:18:53.306 --> 00:18:57.460
They do that by using the
vitamins on the vitamin bottle.

00:18:57.460 --> 00:18:59.850
So enzymes have a
limited repertoire,

00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:12.700
but they increase this
repertoire using vitamins.

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:15.550
This is what we eat out
of our vitamin bottle that

00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:18.660
are converted into co-factors.

00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:23.210
So the vitamins we eat
have to be subtly modified

00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:26.280
and then get incorporated
into the protein catalysts

00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:29.490
and greatly expand
the repertoire.

00:19:29.490 --> 00:19:36.070
So many of you probably-- how
many of you take vitamins?

00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:38.415
Everybody should
be taking vitamins.

00:19:38.415 --> 00:19:39.880
Why don't you take vitamins?

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:46.570
Anyhow, so you can see vitamin
B6, vitamin B2, vitamin B1.

00:19:46.570 --> 00:19:50.070
And over the next
three weeks or so,

00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:54.430
we talk about the chemistry
of how these vitamins interact

00:19:54.430 --> 00:19:56.950
with the protein
catalyst to increase

00:19:56.950 --> 00:20:03.580
the repertoire of reactions
to 10 that actual enzymes can

00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:04.930
catalyze.

00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:06.580
But in addition
to the vitamins, I

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:09.700
want to make mention of
another type of catalyst.

00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:13.740
So most of the vitamins
are organic molecules.

00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:17.130
One also needs to think
about inorganic molecules.

00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:28.050
Inorganic molecules--
copper, zinc, iron,

00:20:28.050 --> 00:20:30.150
all those if you look
at your vitamin bottle

00:20:30.150 --> 00:20:34.200
are at the bottom and
they're labeled inorganic.

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:41.280
And they almost always in
introductory biochemistry

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:43.662
courses get swept
under the table.

00:20:43.662 --> 00:20:45.870
And in fact, many biologists
don't think about metals

00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:46.710
at all.

00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:50.790
But 30% to 35% of
all the enzymes

00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:52.750
have metals incorporated.

00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:56.910
And these metals are essential
for the repertoire of reactions

00:20:56.910 --> 00:20:58.350
that enzymes can catalyze.

00:20:58.350 --> 00:21:00.990
So without going
into any details,

00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:03.570
I just want to
whet your appetite.

00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:05.250
Look at this guy.

00:21:05.250 --> 00:21:07.905
Well, what are we
looking at here?

00:21:07.905 --> 00:21:10.650
These yellow things are sulfurs.

00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:14.720
The purple thing is molybdenum,
and the green things are iron.

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:17.490
And in the middle
of all these irons

00:21:17.490 --> 00:21:23.790
is this silver thing, which is
a carbon bonded to four irons.

00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:25.950
Most of you probably
aren't sophisticated

00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:29.400
enough yet to think
that's amazing,

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:33.600
but it was only two years ago
that the x-ray crystallography

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:35.670
where we can look at
things at atomic resolution

00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:38.290
was good enough so
we can see that guy.

00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:39.540
So what does this guy do?

00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:40.920
What's its function?

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:42.720
Pretty damn important.

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:46.000
It converts nitrogen
into ammonia.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.020
So it turns out to be an
eight electron reduction

00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:51.660
because not only do
you produce ammonia--

00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:53.880
two molecules of
ammonia-- but you also

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:56.920
have to produce a molecule of
hydrogen during that reaction.

00:21:57.725 --> 00:21:59.820
So this is the
basic way we control

00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:03.000
nitrogen-- one of the
basic ways we control

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.770
nitrogen in the environment.

00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:07.980
So chemists would
love to understand

00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:11.310
how this spectacular
inorganic molecule can

00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:15.300
mediate what turns out to
be a six electron reduction.

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:18.730
Another molecule--
co-factor molecule

00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:21.780
that's all metal-based that
I think is equally amazing

00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:23.670
is this one.

00:22:23.670 --> 00:22:26.840
We recently got an atomic
resolution structure down

00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:28.950
to 1.5 angstroms.

00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:31.540
It has four manganese
and a calcium.

00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:34.470
Anybody have any
idea what this does?

00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:39.720
This is the co-factor
that takes water

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:42.060
in the presence of
light-- sunlight--

00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:43.950
and converts it to oxygen gas.

00:22:43.950 --> 00:22:45.750
Why is that important?

00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:49.110
Because we need
oxygen gas to breathe.

00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:53.850
So anyhow, on this one co-factor
mediates that transformation.

00:22:53.850 --> 00:22:55.500
Pretty amazing.

00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:57.450
And that's a major
focus of people

00:22:57.450 --> 00:23:01.560
who want to think about how
these catalysts actually work,

00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:04.830
but we won't be
discussing that further.

00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:08.190
We won't be discussing
that further in 507.

00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:15.720
So I just wanted to point
out here that, again, enzymes

00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:18.980
have a limited repertoire.

00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:22.560
Their repertoire is much less
than what chemists can do,

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:26.050
but they're amazingly
efficient at what they do.

00:23:26.050 --> 00:23:28.500
So I would argue if we
really could understand

00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:31.830
the basis of catalysis and
how these things evolve

00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:35.370
to be able to do these
amazing transformations,

00:23:35.370 --> 00:23:38.700
we might, if I was able to
come back 50 years from now,

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:42.240
see that we had designer
proteins all over the place

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:45.930
that could catalyze the
specific reactions that we're

00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:51.570
interested in, not the ones
that are found in our bodies.

00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:56.340
OK, so the next thing I
want to briefly mention

00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:58.505
is that enzymes, so if
you look at an enzyme,

00:23:58.505 --> 00:24:01.020
it's a big macro molecule.

00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:04.560
We've looked at these in
the last few lectures.

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:08.370
The region where the
chemistry or catalysis occurs

00:24:08.370 --> 00:24:10.440
is called the active site.

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:14.700
And we've seen this
before in the TIN barrel

00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:17.860
superfamily of proteins.

00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:22.410
And so there's a region
of about 10 angstroms.

00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:24.234
We have your amino
acid side chains

00:24:24.234 --> 00:24:26.400
that I asked you to try to
remember and think about.

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:28.710
We'll see those are key
to making these rate

00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:32.340
accelerations so fantastic.

00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:34.620
This is where the
chemistry happens.

00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:36.930
But I think it's now
clear from studies

00:24:36.930 --> 00:24:39.210
that have been done
in the last 15 years

00:24:39.210 --> 00:24:41.580
or so this is not true.

00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:45.420
One can make changes
out here or here.

00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:50.850
One can change the amino acids
and totally turn off the enzyme

00:24:50.850 --> 00:24:52.800
or turn on the enzyme.

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:56.340
So chemists use these
small little molecules,

00:24:56.340 --> 00:24:58.860
biology uses big huge molecules.

00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:02.880
Everybody initially focused
on this one little region

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:06.120
where you can see the chemical
transformation occurring.

00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:08.350
But what about the
rest of the molecule?

00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:11.580
The rest of the molecule
is also important.

00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:16.950
You cannot remove, in general,
all of this spinach and come up

00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:21.420
with a catalyst that has these
amazing rate accelerations.

00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:23.850
So the active site
is very important.

00:25:28.930 --> 00:25:39.341
But so are specific amino acids
outside of the active site.

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:46.750
And people have studied
this because of technology

00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:48.970
of sight directed
mutagenesis, which many of you

00:25:48.970 --> 00:25:55.180
have probably done in
either 702 or in 335.

00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:57.280
So what implications
does that have?

00:25:57.280 --> 00:25:59.750
And I just want to
mention one more thing.

00:25:59.750 --> 00:26:01.600
I don't want to spend
a lot of time on this,

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:07.390
but our thinking about catalysis
is changing dramatically

00:26:07.390 --> 00:26:09.430
and has changed and
continues to change.

00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:14.200
I continue to study
this, even to teach 507.

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:18.730
Because it turns out,
how does change out here

00:26:18.730 --> 00:26:21.280
govern what's going
on in this region

00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:23.860
where you think the
chemistry happens?

00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:27.040
And it governs that
chemistry because

00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:30.460
of conformational
changes and movements.

00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:33.040
So another thing
about enzymes that we

00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:34.930
need to do more thinking
about-- and this

00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:40.330
is a major focus of what
people are thinking about now--

00:26:40.330 --> 00:26:47.110
is dynamics in enzyme
catalyzed reactions.

00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:50.230
And so if you look at the
time scale-- and I made

00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:53.590
you think about size scale
in the first few lectures.

00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:58.210
Like how long is
a hydrogen bond?

00:26:58.210 --> 00:27:00.450
How long is a carbon
nitrogen bond?

00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:01.720
A carbon oxygen bond?

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:05.060
You also need to think
about time scales.

00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:08.110
And this is particularly true
in the case of catalysis.

00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:12.070
What happens on the
fantasecond time scale?

00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:13.540
That's pretty fast.

00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:16.270
That's a vibration of the bond.

00:27:16.270 --> 00:27:19.540
But what are you doing during
an enzyme catalyzed reaction?

00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:22.030
You're breaking the bond
and you're making the bond.

00:27:22.030 --> 00:27:24.790
So we'll see that the
transition state of the reaction

00:27:24.790 --> 00:27:27.480
happens on the
fantasecond time scale.

00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:31.210
Yet, if you look at the
criteria kcat, which

00:27:31.210 --> 00:27:33.100
is a turnover number,
the enzyme, which

00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:35.500
is given in time
inverse, they're

00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:41.850
usually on 10 per second
to 1,000 per second.

00:27:41.850 --> 00:27:44.480
So they're on the millisecond
to second time scale.

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:48.130
So catalysis is
happening way up here.

00:27:48.130 --> 00:27:49.960
Now, I've just told
you that mutations

00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:53.080
outside the active site
can affect catalysis,

00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:57.010
and so one also needs to
think about the time scales

00:27:57.010 --> 00:27:59.530
in between these two extremes.

00:27:59.530 --> 00:28:02.650
I've also told you that
finding an enzyme, finding

00:28:02.650 --> 00:28:08.000
its substrate in solution,
can often be the slow step.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.737
So here you have nanosecond,
microsecond time scales,

00:28:11.737 --> 00:28:13.570
and I'm not going to
spend any time on this,

00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:16.000
but you come back
and look at this

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.770
and think about you've
got all these side

00:28:17.770 --> 00:28:19.190
chains of your amino acids.

00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:21.670
You might have loops that
are moving in and out

00:28:21.670 --> 00:28:24.160
and covering the active site.

00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:28.660
All of this dynamic interaction
plays a key role in catalysis,

00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:33.610
making the enzyme
as a whole important

00:28:33.610 --> 00:28:37.090
in the overall
catalytic process.

00:28:37.090 --> 00:28:42.400
So that's my introduction to you
for what an enzyme catalyst is.

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:49.120
And so now what I want to do
is look at the second bullet

00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:52.290
we were going to talk about,
which I've already lost.

00:28:58.120 --> 00:28:59.770
How do we describe catalysis?

00:28:59.770 --> 00:29:04.870
How do we try to conceptualize
in a theoretical framework

00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:07.180
all of the experimental
observations that

00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:09.310
have been made for decades?

00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:12.400
And there are many things that
are wrong with this theory,

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:16.180
but this theory has
stood the test of time,

00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:20.830
not only for biochemists,
but for also chemists.

00:29:20.830 --> 00:29:24.820
And I think it helps us
to think about how enzymes

00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:28.900
are able with just the amino
acid side chains for protein

00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:33.460
to give us these amazing rate
accelerations and specificity

00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:35.300
that we actually observe.

00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:46.020
So what we want is a theory
to conceptualize catalysis.

00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:50.680
And this is transition
state theory.

00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:02.710
And this is-- many of you
have seen this in some form

00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:05.140
before, either in
freshman chemistry

00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:07.570
or maybe if you've had 560.

00:30:07.570 --> 00:30:10.870
People go through and derive
all of the rate equations.

00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:14.500
What I'm going to
do is just show you

00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:17.230
a picture of how
this theory helps

00:30:17.230 --> 00:30:20.170
us think about these
catalytic transformations

00:30:20.170 --> 00:30:23.920
and then how this picture helps
us think more specifically

00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:26.320
about these amazing
rate accelerations

00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:28.850
that we actually observe.

00:30:28.850 --> 00:30:33.430
OK, so I can't remember
what's on the next slide,

00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:36.280
but this is a picture
you often see when you're

00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:40.240
thinking about catalysis.

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:45.310
So this is chemical catalysis,
but again, chemical catalysis,

00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:49.060
biological catalysis, really
the same basic principles

00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:59.190
hold that we have
some substrates A

00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:05.090
and B going to products
and what's required.

00:31:05.090 --> 00:31:07.370
So I think all of
this is intuitive,

00:31:07.370 --> 00:31:10.880
but if you have two
things coming together,

00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:13.340
they have to come together
in exactly the right way

00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:15.890
to be able to make a bond.

00:31:15.890 --> 00:31:20.810
They have to remove all the
solvent from outside them.

00:31:20.810 --> 00:31:23.420
They have to come
together with enough force

00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:27.050
to be able to get over the
barrier, whatever it is,

00:31:27.050 --> 00:31:30.770
to break one bond and
to form a new bond.

00:31:30.770 --> 00:31:35.630
So that's true of all
reactions and everybody faces

00:31:35.630 --> 00:31:40.250
the same issues in terms
of conversion of substrate

00:31:40.250 --> 00:31:41.600
into products.

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:44.030
And the highest point
along the reaction

00:31:44.030 --> 00:31:46.700
coordinate-- so
this is what we call

00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:48.370
a reaction coordinate diagram.

00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:57.130
And this is energy.

00:31:57.130 --> 00:32:00.940
So the highest point along the
reaction coordinate diagram

00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:04.930
is called the
transition state-- TS.

00:32:04.930 --> 00:32:08.060
This is transition state theory.

00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:10.390
OK, TS theory.

00:32:10.390 --> 00:32:13.180
And this is where-- this is
the point where we can ever

00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:15.879
isolate it because
this is a point where

00:32:15.879 --> 00:32:17.170
all the chemistry is happening.

00:32:17.170 --> 00:32:19.210
The bonds are being
made and broken.

00:32:19.210 --> 00:32:21.690
And the lifetime I just showed
you on the previous slide

00:32:21.690 --> 00:32:23.530
is fast-- fentaseconds.

00:32:23.530 --> 00:32:26.710
So you can never isolate
a transition state.

00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:28.420
Everything needs to be aligned.

00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:30.010
That doesn't come
free of charge.

00:32:30.010 --> 00:32:32.170
You have to do a lot of
work to get to the stage

00:32:32.170 --> 00:32:34.420
where you can get this
chemistry to happen.

00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:36.430
That's what our
catalysts are doing.

00:32:36.430 --> 00:32:42.020
And then bang, the reaction
is over at that time.

00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:45.130
So this is another way of
describing the transition

00:32:45.130 --> 00:32:46.870
state of the reaction.

00:32:46.870 --> 00:32:50.260
And in reality,
this is the cartoon

00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:58.270
you see in most introductory
textbooks that are describing

00:32:58.270 --> 00:32:59.590
rates of reaction.

00:32:59.590 --> 00:33:03.100
But the reaction coordinate is
much, much more complicated.

00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:06.250
And that's true in
enzymatic reactions as well.

00:33:06.250 --> 00:33:08.320
So it's true of
chemical reactions,

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:10.001
it's true enzymatic reactions.

00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:16.570
So you might have
a plus b, and they

00:33:16.570 --> 00:33:22.240
might form two or
three intermediates

00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:27.580
along the reaction
pathway where you

00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:32.410
have many transitions-- you
have many transition states

00:33:32.410 --> 00:33:34.990
along the reaction pathway.

00:33:34.990 --> 00:33:39.610
And each of these transitions
states would be non-isolable.

00:33:39.610 --> 00:33:41.360
But what about these
little valleys?

00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:43.610
These little valleys are
where you might have a chance

00:33:43.610 --> 00:33:46.810
to see an intermediate during
the conversion of a plus

00:33:46.810 --> 00:33:49.450
b into p plus q.

00:33:49.450 --> 00:33:53.830
So an intermediate--
and if you're

00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:57.430
interested in studying
catalysis and the chemistry

00:33:57.430 --> 00:33:59.470
of the reaction and
you need to define

00:33:59.470 --> 00:34:03.350
what these intermediates
are, they can be high

00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:04.930
or that could be
lower in energy.

00:34:04.930 --> 00:34:07.900
They may be easy to isolate,
not easy to isolate.

00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:14.230
But they have all
covalent bonds intact.

00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:17.489
So in contrast to the
transition state where

00:34:17.489 --> 00:34:19.466
the bonds are being
made and broken,

00:34:19.466 --> 00:34:20.590
you can never isolate this.

00:34:20.590 --> 00:34:23.980
You have a chance to be able--
if you're clever and creative,

00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:27.130
which people that
study mechanisms are,

00:34:27.130 --> 00:34:29.920
you can actually look
at the intermediates

00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:32.409
along the reaction coordinate.

00:34:32.409 --> 00:34:34.485
So that's a reaction
coordinate diagram.

00:34:34.485 --> 00:34:35.860
We're going to
come back to these

00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:41.290
because I think they really help
us to conceptualize how enzymes

00:34:41.290 --> 00:34:46.510
can go about achieving these
fantastic rate accelerations.

00:34:46.510 --> 00:34:52.780
So from transition
state theory, one

00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:54.400
assumes the following--
I'm not going

00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:56.889
to go through the
details of this at all.

00:34:56.889 --> 00:34:59.980
But the key point that
one needs to think about

00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:02.880
in transition state
theory is that--

00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:06.250
and this was first put
forth by Linus Pauling.

00:35:06.250 --> 00:35:07.270
Who's Linus Pauling?

00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:08.730
He's my hero.

00:35:08.730 --> 00:35:10.920
OK, Linus Pauling,
he's the vitamin C guy.

00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:13.630
He lost it when he got
old, but in the early days,

00:35:13.630 --> 00:35:16.540
he's the one that could take
a polypeptide chain-- just

00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:19.510
a string of amino
acids-- and he sat there

00:35:19.510 --> 00:35:20.950
and he played with it.

00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:22.510
And lo and behold,
he says, we're

00:35:22.510 --> 00:35:24.880
going to have alpha
helices in proteins.

00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:25.930
How amazing is that?

00:35:25.930 --> 00:35:27.820
You've heard me talk
about him before.

00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:31.750
He was the one that I think
conceptualized-- first

00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:36.260
conceptualized-- how an enzyme
might catalyze a reaction.

00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:39.610
What do you want to do
to catalyze a reaction?

00:35:39.610 --> 00:35:42.640
You want to lower this barrier.

00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:45.100
So how do you lower the barrier?

00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:48.640
You don't want the enzyme to
bind the substrates tightly,

00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:50.320
and I'll come back
to this in a minute.

00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:54.790
You want to bind the
transition state tightly.

00:35:54.790 --> 00:35:59.170
So he put forth in the
1940s that the way enzymes

00:35:59.170 --> 00:36:01.510
might be able to catalyze
their reactions is

00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:05.320
by tightly binding--
uniquely and tightly binding

00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:07.850
the transition state
of the reaction.

00:36:07.850 --> 00:36:11.410
And I think that turns out
to be a really good way

00:36:11.410 --> 00:36:15.010
to conceptualize most
enzymatic reactions.

00:36:15.010 --> 00:36:17.950
Now, transition
state theory tells

00:36:17.950 --> 00:36:22.430
us, which again is
not so appealing to me

00:36:22.430 --> 00:36:26.060
but it works to describe
most experimental data,

00:36:26.060 --> 00:36:30.050
that the ground state-- so this
would be the ground state--

00:36:30.050 --> 00:36:32.565
is in equilibrium with
the transition state.

00:36:32.565 --> 00:36:34.190
So you might ask
yourself, how the heck

00:36:34.190 --> 00:36:36.064
can you ever be in
equilibrium with something

00:36:36.064 --> 00:36:37.880
with such a short half life?

00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:39.920
That's a good question to ask.

00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:44.240
But in fact, this framework--
transition state theory--

00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:47.030
allows us to able
to explain almost

00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:49.280
all the experimental
observations

00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:52.850
that we make as both
chemists and biochemists.

00:36:52.850 --> 00:36:55.607
So this goes through and
derives that equation, which

00:36:55.607 --> 00:36:56.690
I'm not going to do today.

00:36:56.690 --> 00:36:58.606
In the old days, I used
to spend a lot of time

00:36:58.606 --> 00:37:00.260
deriving equations.

00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:03.860
Nowadays, I don't derive
equations anymore.

00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:06.590
But the key equation that
you need to think about

00:37:06.590 --> 00:37:09.580
is shown here.

00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:16.550
And the consequences of this
equation are quite simple.

00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:22.850
It tells you that the rate
constant for the reaction-- so

00:37:22.850 --> 00:37:29.820
from transition state
theory, the rate

00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:31.151
constant for the reaction.

00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:41.140
And where is this rate constant?

00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:44.350
Where does this rate
constant come from?

00:37:44.350 --> 00:37:45.670
A is going to some product p.

00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:47.090
You can measure
it experimentally.

00:37:47.090 --> 00:37:50.560
So k observed is an
experimentally measurable

00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:56.650
parameter is equal to a
bunch of constants called

00:37:56.650 --> 00:37:58.110
the transmission coefficient.

00:37:58.110 --> 00:38:00.130
This should be a cappa.

00:38:00.130 --> 00:38:03.460
Boltzmann's
constant, temperature

00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:08.050
in degrees Kelvin,
Planck's constant times

00:38:08.050 --> 00:38:14.440
e to the minus delta
g dagger over rg.

00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:15.624
So this is the equation.

00:38:15.624 --> 00:38:16.415
This is a constant.

00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:21.970
This is Planck's constant,
Boltzmann's constant.

00:38:21.970 --> 00:38:23.590
This you can measure
experimentally.

00:38:23.590 --> 00:38:27.730
Cappa is telling you basically--
the transmission coefficient

00:38:27.730 --> 00:38:30.940
is telling you the frequency
that this transition state

00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:34.210
breaks down to form
products versus going back

00:38:34.210 --> 00:38:38.130
to starting materials and in
general, is on the order of one

00:38:38.130 --> 00:38:39.850
in most reactions.

00:38:39.850 --> 00:38:43.120
And so the key thing to remember
from this equation, which

00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:48.280
explains the data and helps
us to think about catalysis,

00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:54.910
is that as you increase
the rate of the reaction,

00:38:54.910 --> 00:38:58.510
it's inversely related to
the activation barrier.

00:38:58.510 --> 00:39:01.120
So what you want to do,
this equation tells you,

00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:04.840
is you lower this barrier.

00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:08.140
The rate of your reaction
becomes faster and faster.

00:39:08.140 --> 00:39:10.450
So the whole goal is,
then, to figure out

00:39:10.450 --> 00:39:11.740
how to lower the barrier.

00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:14.290
If you can lower the
barrier, this theory

00:39:14.290 --> 00:39:18.310
predicts that the rate of
your reaction will be faster.

00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:20.980
So that's what we
want to be able to do.

00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:24.760
The rate constant
is inversely related

00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:28.880
to the activation barrier.

00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:33.324
And so now let's look at an
enzyme system specifically.

00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:39.130
So I'm going to draw the
same kind of reaction

00:39:39.130 --> 00:39:45.040
coordinate that we've drawn over
there for a chemical reaction.

00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:49.520
And I'm going to use
a simple equation.

00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:56.890
E is the enzyme, s is
the substrate forms

00:39:56.890 --> 00:39:58.750
an enzyme substrate complex.

00:39:58.750 --> 00:40:00.400
The substrate
binds in the region

00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:04.340
that we call the
active site over here.

00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:11.110
Somehow, the enzyme is able to
convert itself into product.

00:40:11.110 --> 00:40:13.560
Now, most reactions are much
more complicated than this.

00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:14.601
You have many substrates.

00:40:14.601 --> 00:40:17.260
You have many products.

00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:19.540
But it doesn't affect
anything in terms

00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:21.550
of thinking about the problem.

00:40:21.550 --> 00:40:25.900
And then in the end,
the product dissociates.

00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:27.640
So that's a simple reaction.

00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:30.640
You get something in there,
a catalyst works on it,

00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:32.350
it gets converted to
the desired product,

00:40:32.350 --> 00:40:35.170
and the product is released.

00:40:35.170 --> 00:40:38.470
So what I've told you
now a couple of times

00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:42.730
is that enzymes have
evolved to such an extent

00:40:42.730 --> 00:40:46.090
that often the physical
steps and not the chemistry

00:40:46.090 --> 00:40:47.140
is rate limiting.

00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:50.290
So what are the physical steps?

00:40:50.290 --> 00:40:53.920
Here are the physical steps.

00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:56.770
Enzyme finding
substrate and solution,

00:40:56.770 --> 00:40:58.250
that's a physical step.

00:40:58.250 --> 00:40:59.800
What is limited by?

00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:01.900
It's limited by
diffusion control.

00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:05.230
How fast can they find
each other in solution?

00:41:05.230 --> 00:41:07.840
That's the number 10
to the 8 per molar

00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:11.500
per second that limits most
enzyme-based reactions that I

00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:14.020
showed you several slides ago.

00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:15.670
What about this?

00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:21.100
We have product dissociation.

00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:22.510
What about product dissociation?

00:41:22.510 --> 00:41:23.670
That's a physical step too.

00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:25.640
You made the product
sitting around,

00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:29.320
but in order for the
enzyme to turn over, again,

00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:31.240
to free up the active
site, the product

00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:35.410
has to come off so it can
bind another substrate.

00:41:35.410 --> 00:41:40.390
And here is the chemistry.

00:41:40.390 --> 00:41:42.810
Ah, that's what I care about.

00:41:42.810 --> 00:41:47.430
But what happens, now, is
that if these steps are

00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:51.120
rate limiting, then you
can't see the chemistry.

00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:54.240
So it's really challenging,
often really challenging,

00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:57.600
to study the chemistry
of a reaction

00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:00.420
because the rate limiting
steps have nothing

00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:01.800
to do with the chemistry.

00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:04.560
So let me just draw a diagram.

00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:06.754
So you can draw a reaction
coordinate diagram.

00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:16.530
And so what you have is
some enzyme plus substrate

00:42:16.530 --> 00:42:22.164
and it can form an
enzyme substrate complex.

00:42:26.430 --> 00:42:29.160
You have a transition
state of your reaction.

00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:32.490
The enzyme product
complex can then

00:42:32.490 --> 00:42:37.080
dissociate to form
enzyme plus product.

00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:38.940
So what you need to
think about if you're

00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:41.940
thinking about how to
accelerate the reaction is

00:42:41.940 --> 00:42:44.797
what is the bottleneck
in the overall reaction?

00:42:44.797 --> 00:42:46.380
You don't want to
start mucking around

00:42:46.380 --> 00:42:47.910
with something that
doesn't control

00:42:47.910 --> 00:42:48.980
the rate of the reaction.

00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:51.900
So you need to know what
the rate limiting step

00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:53.670
is in the reaction.

00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:59.580
And the rate limiting step
is the highest barrier

00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:01.121
along the reaction coordinate.

00:43:11.090 --> 00:43:17.760
OK, now I've already told you
that this is a simple case.

00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:21.210
We have one substrate getting
converted into product.

00:43:21.210 --> 00:43:26.280
Most enzymatic reactions are
going to have many barriers.

00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:31.380
And so in order to affect the
overall rate of the reaction,

00:43:31.380 --> 00:43:33.690
you need to figure out
what's rate limiting,

00:43:33.690 --> 00:43:37.200
and somehow the
enzyme has figured out

00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:41.710
how to lower the barrier to make
this reaction easier to occur.

00:43:41.710 --> 00:43:46.560
Remember, I just told you that
the rate constant is inversely

00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:48.880
related to this
activation barrier.

00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:54.060
So if we can lower
this barrier somehow,

00:43:54.060 --> 00:43:56.310
what we're going to see, if
we can lower this barrier,

00:43:56.310 --> 00:44:01.460
now we have a lower overall
rate of the reaction.

00:44:01.460 --> 00:44:05.430
So this theory
allows us to think

00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:10.200
about what we need to do to
make these catalysts actually

00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:14.070
work with rate constants of
10 to 6 to 10 to 15 times

00:44:14.070 --> 00:44:18.000
faster than
non-catalyzed reactions.

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:20.970
And I want to say one other
thing before you move on.

00:44:20.970 --> 00:44:24.510
As with everything,
I think it's good

00:44:24.510 --> 00:44:29.790
that we're in a field
that's rapidly changing.

00:44:29.790 --> 00:44:33.370
Remember, I told you have
to think about dynamics.

00:44:33.370 --> 00:44:37.170
We no longer think about
a single reaction barrier.

00:44:37.170 --> 00:44:39.360
That's in most of
the textbooks now.

00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:43.710
Really what we think about is
we bring dynamics into this.

00:44:43.710 --> 00:44:46.950
I told you things
outside the active site

00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:50.310
can modulate what's going
on inside the active site.

00:44:50.310 --> 00:44:53.610
What we think about is
a reaction landscape.

00:44:53.610 --> 00:44:57.750
And so one has many barriers
that one has to get over.

00:44:57.750 --> 00:45:01.921
Almost all reactions
involve multiple barriers.

00:45:01.921 --> 00:45:04.170
So you've got to figure out
which one is rate limiting

00:45:04.170 --> 00:45:08.550
and lower that
activation barrier.

00:45:08.550 --> 00:45:11.790
And enzymes, if you think
about this, they're huge.

00:45:11.790 --> 00:45:13.920
Do they all fold
exactly the same way?

00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:15.270
No.

00:45:15.270 --> 00:45:17.710
So we always think we
have a homogeneous enzyme.

00:45:17.710 --> 00:45:18.480
No.

00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:20.310
If any of you work
in UROPs, you'll

00:45:20.310 --> 00:45:21.630
find that out pretty fast.

00:45:21.630 --> 00:45:26.250
You use recombinant technology
to fold things inside the cell.

00:45:26.250 --> 00:45:27.830
They don't all fold right.

00:45:27.830 --> 00:45:30.510
So you have all
mixtures of things.

00:45:30.510 --> 00:45:32.700
And so you get a
reaction landscape.

00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:38.970
And so this axis is
bringing in the dynamics

00:45:38.970 --> 00:45:40.740
that I told you about
earlier on that you

00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:43.560
need to think about-- the
conformational changes that

00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:46.410
occur every step along
the reaction pathway.

00:45:46.410 --> 00:45:51.000
The enzyme is moving
at all kinds of steps,

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:57.300
reorienting everything to get
the chemistry exactly right.

00:45:57.300 --> 00:46:02.220
So what I want to do now
is-- so that gives you

00:46:02.220 --> 00:46:07.110
a way to conceptualize
rate accelerations.

00:46:07.110 --> 00:46:08.790
Now what I want
to do is tell you

00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:13.440
what the major mechanisms are
that the enzyme uses to enhance

00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:14.730
the rates of these reactions.

00:46:14.730 --> 00:46:18.660
How do we lower these
energy barriers?

00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:19.490
So let me see.

00:46:19.490 --> 00:46:22.100
I need to start
erasing somewhere.

00:46:26.490 --> 00:46:29.263
OK, so we're on the
third bullet over here.

00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:34.540
Mechanisms of catalysis.

00:46:34.540 --> 00:46:36.300
And what we're going
to be talking about

00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:39.070
is multiple mechanisms
of catalysis.

00:46:39.070 --> 00:46:43.590
We're going to be talking
about binding energy, which

00:46:43.590 --> 00:46:47.120
is the one people have most
trouble thinking about.

00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:55.950
We're going to be talking about
general acid, general base

00:46:55.950 --> 00:46:57.350
catalysis.

00:46:57.350 --> 00:47:02.580
And we're going to be talking
about covalent catalysis.

00:47:02.580 --> 00:47:06.006
And we will see
that over the course

00:47:06.006 --> 00:47:07.380
of the rest of
the semester, when

00:47:07.380 --> 00:47:09.810
we start talking about
metabolic pathways,

00:47:09.810 --> 00:47:13.590
all of these mechanisms
are used in almost

00:47:13.590 --> 00:47:16.430
all enzyme catalyzed
reactions to give us

00:47:16.430 --> 00:47:20.785
these tremendous
rate accelerations.

00:47:20.785 --> 00:47:24.060
What I want to do-- that's
the first time I did that.

00:47:24.060 --> 00:47:25.106
That wasn't too bad.

00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:33.490
OK, so what are the
mechanisms of catalysis?

00:47:36.300 --> 00:47:46.154
How do we get 10 to the 6 to
10 to the 15 accelerations?

00:47:49.590 --> 00:47:51.870
And so the first
thing, and I think

00:47:51.870 --> 00:47:56.250
the one that really is unique
to enzyme catalysts compared

00:47:56.250 --> 00:47:59.640
to small inorganic
or organic molecules,

00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:03.550
is the use of binding
energy in catalysis.

00:48:03.550 --> 00:48:05.610
So this is the one--
and this is also

00:48:05.610 --> 00:48:08.450
the one that's thought to
contribute the greatest

00:48:08.450 --> 00:48:13.700
amount to these factors
of up to 10 to 15.

00:48:13.700 --> 00:48:23.200
So binding energy in catalysis,
and what does that mean?

00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:26.100
What do we need to think about?

00:48:26.100 --> 00:48:29.370
So the enzyme binds
to a substrate.

00:48:29.370 --> 00:48:34.470
If we take this simple
case, we need it to bind.

00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:36.210
We need it to bind specifically.

00:48:36.210 --> 00:48:37.740
So that's a key
part of the enzyme

00:48:37.740 --> 00:48:40.020
that we haven't gotten
to yet-- specificity.

00:48:40.020 --> 00:48:43.280
But what if it bound its
substrate really tightly?

00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:46.220
Do you think that would be good?

00:48:46.220 --> 00:48:47.220
No.

00:48:47.220 --> 00:48:49.500
So it's not good
because what does it do?

00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:57.090
If it took all of the spinach
changing off of your substrate

00:48:57.090 --> 00:48:59.820
and made hydrogen bonds and
Van Der Waals interactions,

00:48:59.820 --> 00:49:03.000
all the weak
non-covalent interactions

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:05.280
we spent a half
a lecture talking

00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:11.691
about four or five lectures
ago, what would happen is you

00:49:11.691 --> 00:49:12.690
would have type binding.

00:49:12.690 --> 00:49:14.520
You would have lower energy.

00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:20.100
But what does that then do
to the activation barrier?

00:49:20.100 --> 00:49:23.580
It increases the
activation barrier.

00:49:23.580 --> 00:49:37.510
So the binding energy is the
free energy released when

00:49:37.510 --> 00:49:39.400
enzyme combines with substrate.

00:49:45.380 --> 00:49:49.080
But the key is that
this bind energy is not

00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:51.420
used to bind completely.

00:49:51.420 --> 00:49:53.410
It's used for catalysis.

00:49:53.410 --> 00:50:06.690
So this energy is used
both to bind substrate

00:50:06.690 --> 00:50:09.524
and-- and this is the key
thing-- for catalysis.

00:50:15.660 --> 00:50:19.100
So what do we want to be able
to do and how does it do this?

00:50:19.100 --> 00:50:23.100
So if we look at this, if
we look at our reaction

00:50:23.100 --> 00:50:27.870
coordinate diagram over here,
we don't want to bind substrate

00:50:27.870 --> 00:50:30.510
tightly because this is the
biggest barrier-- the rate

00:50:30.510 --> 00:50:33.450
limiting step along
the reaction pathway.

00:50:33.450 --> 00:50:36.000
What we want to do is
lower this barrier.

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:38.460
So how can we lower the barrier?

00:50:38.460 --> 00:50:43.020
We can lower the barrier by
stabilizing the transition

00:50:43.020 --> 00:50:44.060
state.

00:50:44.060 --> 00:50:48.350
That now makes this
barrier-- probably

00:50:48.350 --> 00:50:51.365
can't read anything now, but
that makes this barrier lower.

00:50:51.365 --> 00:50:53.790
How's another way you
could lower the barrier?

00:50:53.790 --> 00:50:57.350
You could lower the barrier
by straining the substrate

00:50:57.350 --> 00:50:59.520
to look more like
the transition state.

00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:03.100
So you could strain the
substrate in this form,

00:51:03.100 --> 00:51:07.260
and now, again, you would
have a lower barrier compared

00:51:07.260 --> 00:51:08.640
to that barrier.

00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:14.610
So you're going to use this
binding energy to stabilize

00:51:14.610 --> 00:51:17.460
a transition state.

00:51:17.460 --> 00:51:31.590
So we want to use binding energy
to stabilize the transition

00:51:31.590 --> 00:51:39.700
state to de-stabilize-- any
of these or all of these

00:51:39.700 --> 00:51:51.490
could be true-- de-stabilize
the ground state-- G-S.

00:51:51.490 --> 00:51:55.060
Or what else do you need
to do to get a reaction

00:51:55.060 --> 00:51:58.030
to work if you have one or
two substrates or even one

00:51:58.030 --> 00:51:59.040
substrate?

00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:02.075
Your molecules in
solution are all solvated.

00:52:02.075 --> 00:52:04.450
What you need to be able to
do is get rid of the solvent.

00:52:04.450 --> 00:52:07.240
If you have two substrates, you
have to bring them together.

00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:10.420
You have to bring them together
at the right orientation.

00:52:10.420 --> 00:52:11.940
That doesn't come
free of charge.

00:52:11.940 --> 00:52:14.110
You have to get the
energy from somewhere,

00:52:14.110 --> 00:52:17.540
and the energy is proposed to
come from this binding energy.

00:52:17.540 --> 00:52:19.270
So the binding
energy is not used

00:52:19.270 --> 00:52:21.250
to completely bind
the substrate,

00:52:21.250 --> 00:52:24.820
but to do all of these
things to get your substrates

00:52:24.820 --> 00:52:26.680
ready to form product.

00:52:26.680 --> 00:52:39.380
So you can dissolvate and
bring reactants together.

00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:49.620
And you can freeze out
rotational, translational

00:52:49.620 --> 00:52:50.200
entropy.

00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:53.610
So you're getting everything
ready for the reaction

00:52:53.610 --> 00:52:54.790
to happen.

00:52:54.790 --> 00:52:57.900
So in this case, then, let me
just erase this and make this

00:52:57.900 --> 00:53:00.150
so that this is clearer.

00:53:00.150 --> 00:53:06.000
What you could have, now, is
you can-- so in the beginning,

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:07.050
this is the barrier.

00:53:07.050 --> 00:53:11.820
If you stabilize the transition
state, this becomes a barrier.

00:53:11.820 --> 00:53:14.760
If you de-stabilize
the ground state,

00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:17.580
then this becomes the barrier.

00:53:17.580 --> 00:53:21.000
So what we're trying to
do is lower this barrier

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:24.630
to get the reaction to work.

00:53:24.630 --> 00:53:28.980
And so the major
way that we do this

00:53:28.980 --> 00:53:33.330
is by using the interactions
between the enzymes

00:53:33.330 --> 00:53:36.240
of the weak non-covalent
interactions between the enzyme

00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:39.300
and substrate to help
us do these things

00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:42.570
to enhance catalysis.

00:53:42.570 --> 00:53:48.350
So that's one of the major
mechanisms of catalysis.

00:53:48.350 --> 00:53:51.510
A second-- and this
type of catalysis

00:53:51.510 --> 00:53:55.120
is unique to proteins.

00:53:55.120 --> 00:54:01.410
So the two types of
catalysis are used widely

00:54:01.410 --> 00:54:03.600
in organic or
inorganic chemistry

00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:06.270
when you're designing
your catalyst.

00:54:06.270 --> 00:54:10.590
I mean, when you're designing
a catalyst substrate binding,

00:54:10.590 --> 00:54:14.130
a small molecule, a big product
release is still an issue.

00:54:14.130 --> 00:54:17.070
If you go and read the
organometallic literature,

00:54:17.070 --> 00:54:19.350
people have trouble with
product release all the time.

00:54:19.350 --> 00:54:23.180
So the issues in catalysis
are exactly the same

00:54:23.180 --> 00:54:26.790
in biochemistry as they are
in organic and inorganic.

00:54:26.790 --> 00:54:29.460
But now we have to deal
with this big protein, which

00:54:29.460 --> 00:54:32.070
has these unique
properties, one of which

00:54:32.070 --> 00:54:36.210
is that the whole protein is
playing a key role in catalysis

00:54:36.210 --> 00:54:40.770
and allowing everything to
align within tenths of angstroms

00:54:40.770 --> 00:54:43.770
to make these reactions work
really efficiently, which

00:54:43.770 --> 00:54:46.560
chemists can't do yet.

00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:49.380
And I don't think we'll
ever be able to design it,

00:54:49.380 --> 00:54:53.340
but we can evolve catalysts
to become better and better

00:54:53.340 --> 00:54:54.930
so that they can
do the same thing.

00:54:54.930 --> 00:54:58.560
That's the beauty of proteins
is you can evolve them to become

00:54:58.560 --> 00:55:01.830
better and better catalysts.

00:55:01.830 --> 00:55:05.790
So the second mechanism--
so the first mechanism

00:55:05.790 --> 00:55:07.390
is binding energy.

00:55:07.390 --> 00:55:10.980
The second mechanism-- I can't
remember whether they're using

00:55:10.980 --> 00:55:11.940
I's or 2's.

00:55:11.940 --> 00:55:22.960
The second mechanism is general
acid, general base catalysis.

00:55:28.440 --> 00:55:31.050
Now, as a chemist,
what do you learn

00:55:31.050 --> 00:55:32.790
about catalyzing reactions?

00:55:32.790 --> 00:55:36.270
Well, one way you could do
it is with a big fat proton.

00:55:36.270 --> 00:55:39.510
Protons are pretty good at
helping you catalyze reactions

00:55:39.510 --> 00:55:44.310
if you go back and think
about chemical transformations

00:55:44.310 --> 00:55:47.580
or hydroxide ions.

00:55:47.580 --> 00:55:51.270
What are the concentration
of protons and hydroxide ions

00:55:51.270 --> 00:55:54.540
in aqueous solution of pH 7?

00:55:54.540 --> 00:55:56.790
10 to the minus 7 molar.

00:55:56.790 --> 00:56:00.300
So you don't have much
protons and hydroxide

00:56:00.300 --> 00:56:01.620
ions in the active site.

00:56:01.620 --> 00:56:04.380
So even though these
are very good catalysts

00:56:04.380 --> 00:56:06.510
that organic chemists
and inorganic chemists

00:56:06.510 --> 00:56:09.579
use all the time, they're
using them in organic solvents,

00:56:09.579 --> 00:56:11.370
you can argue the active
site of the enzyme

00:56:11.370 --> 00:56:13.530
is more like an organic solvent.

00:56:13.530 --> 00:56:18.730
But anyhow, this type of
catalysis is called specific.

00:56:18.730 --> 00:56:23.360
So when you see specific
acid or based catalysis--

00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:27.560
where does the general acid
and base catalysis come from?

00:56:27.560 --> 00:56:30.200
It comes from the side
chain of your amino acids.

00:56:30.200 --> 00:56:33.980
So remember, the second
or third lecture I said,

00:56:33.980 --> 00:56:35.710
oh, here are all
the amino acids.

00:56:35.710 --> 00:56:37.520
Here are all the side chains.

00:56:37.520 --> 00:56:40.310
You really shouldn't know
all of your amino acids.

00:56:40.310 --> 00:56:42.680
It's a basic vocabulary
of all of biochemistry,

00:56:42.680 --> 00:56:44.710
and the pKas of all
the side chains.

00:56:44.710 --> 00:56:45.830
Why?

00:56:45.830 --> 00:56:46.900
That's why.

00:56:46.900 --> 00:56:50.020
Because you can't understand
anything about catalysis

00:56:50.020 --> 00:56:53.540
without knowing what these
side chains of the enzymes

00:56:53.540 --> 00:56:54.790
are actually doing.

00:56:54.790 --> 00:56:57.500
So the general acid
and base catalysis

00:56:57.500 --> 00:57:03.930
come from the side chains
of your amino acids.

00:57:03.930 --> 00:57:07.710
So what side chains do you have?

00:57:07.710 --> 00:57:09.400
You can have carboxylates.

00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:12.225
Anybody know what the
pKa of a carboxylate is?

00:57:14.810 --> 00:57:16.280
Hey, Boggin, what is it?

00:57:16.280 --> 00:57:17.894
STUDENT: Four to five.

00:57:17.894 --> 00:57:19.310
JOANNE STUBBE:
Good, four to five.

00:57:19.310 --> 00:57:20.879
See, he remembers.

00:57:20.879 --> 00:57:21.920
You could have imidazole.

00:57:27.770 --> 00:57:31.850
This has a pKa at neutral pH.

00:57:31.850 --> 00:57:33.580
Anyhow, you need
to go back and look

00:57:33.580 --> 00:57:36.770
at what the groups are that
can be involved in catalysis.

00:57:36.770 --> 00:57:39.790
And chemists, for
decades, have studied

00:57:39.790 --> 00:57:43.150
how you can use general
acid and base catalysis

00:57:43.150 --> 00:57:45.160
to give you rate enhancements.

00:57:45.160 --> 00:57:48.850
Now, what I haven't told you is
the amount of rate enhancement

00:57:48.850 --> 00:57:53.290
And so people over the
years have measured

00:57:53.290 --> 00:57:57.230
that with binding energy, you
can get factors of 10 to the 8.

00:57:57.230 --> 00:58:01.100
If you look at general acid
base catalysis from all

00:58:01.100 --> 00:58:03.080
the organic and
inorganic reactions

00:58:03.080 --> 00:58:09.400
people have studied for decades,
you get factors of 100 to 1,000

00:58:09.400 --> 00:58:11.350
fold.

00:58:11.350 --> 00:58:14.810
Now, we need to get to a factor
of 10 to the 15 in some cases.

00:58:14.810 --> 00:58:17.620
We've already gotten to
the factor of 10 to 6.

00:58:17.620 --> 00:58:19.250
So obviously,
you're going to have

00:58:19.250 --> 00:58:22.360
to use multiple combinations
of these mechanisms

00:58:22.360 --> 00:58:27.130
to give you these tremendous
rate accelerations.

00:58:27.130 --> 00:58:33.290
So you will see over the course
of the rest of the semester

00:58:33.290 --> 00:58:37.690
many active sites of enzymes
with many amino acid side

00:58:37.690 --> 00:58:42.440
chains that are playing roles
in general acid and base

00:58:42.440 --> 00:58:44.560
catalysis.

00:58:44.560 --> 00:58:52.015
And the last type of catalysis
is covalent catalysis.

00:58:56.900 --> 00:59:01.750
And again, covalent catalysis
means that you form--

00:59:01.750 --> 00:59:05.200
and where have you already
seen covalent catalysis?

00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:07.810
You've already seen this
when we talked about, how

00:59:07.810 --> 00:59:10.145
do you study the structure
of the primary structure

00:59:10.145 --> 00:59:11.880
of a protein?

00:59:11.880 --> 00:59:15.300
We use proteases with
tripsin or kimotripsan

00:59:15.300 --> 00:59:18.220
that can break down the big
protein into small pieces.

00:59:18.220 --> 00:59:20.670
We went through the
mechanism of that reaction.

00:59:20.670 --> 00:59:22.570
In the active site
of that enzyme,

00:59:22.570 --> 00:59:26.220
there is a serine that
forms a covalent bond.

00:59:26.220 --> 00:59:28.900
So over the course
of the semester,

00:59:28.900 --> 00:59:30.970
you're going to
see many examples.

00:59:30.970 --> 00:59:33.130
And I'll just put in
parentheses for those of you

00:59:33.130 --> 00:59:38.360
who don't remember, go back
and look at serine proteases.

00:59:38.360 --> 00:59:42.660
This is a classic example
that's in every textbook.

00:59:42.660 --> 00:59:45.580
And how do we know how
much rate acceleration

00:59:45.580 --> 00:59:48.490
you get from covalent
catalysis versus not having

00:59:48.490 --> 00:59:49.560
covalent catalysis.

00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:54.010
We know this, again, because
of organic chemists studying

00:59:54.010 --> 00:59:57.870
the detailed chemical
mechanisms of these reactions,

00:59:57.870 --> 01:00:00.520
and we find out
that in this case,

01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:07.890
we get rate accelerations
of 100 to 1,000 fold.

01:00:07.890 --> 01:00:09.930
So what you see is the enzymes.

01:00:09.930 --> 01:00:13.680
And these are the three
general mechanisms

01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:17.280
by which all enzymes
catalyze their reactions

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:18.870
in some variation.

01:00:18.870 --> 01:00:24.150
Now, attributing out of
this 10 to 15, 10 to the 8

01:00:24.150 --> 01:00:26.320
is associated with
this, and 10 squared

01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:29.010
is associated with that
is extremely challenging.

01:00:29.010 --> 01:00:30.900
And there are a lot
of people still trying

01:00:30.900 --> 01:00:35.320
to dissect reaction
mechanisms in detail.

01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:39.070
And I would argue
that understanding

01:00:39.070 --> 01:00:42.280
how these different methods
work and synergize to give you

01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:45.820
these accelerations is a
key to eventually designing

01:00:45.820 --> 01:00:49.660
new catalysts that
can do what you

01:00:49.660 --> 01:00:52.710
want them to do that's
distinct from biological

01:00:52.710 --> 01:00:54.220
transformations.

01:00:54.220 --> 01:00:56.074
And I think I'm probably over.

01:00:56.074 --> 01:00:57.490
I just want to say
one more thing.

01:00:57.490 --> 01:00:59.550
I just want to
give you a feeling

01:00:59.550 --> 01:01:03.430
for what you have to do.

01:01:03.430 --> 01:01:07.110
If you're thinking about this
reaction coordinate, what

01:01:07.110 --> 01:01:09.210
you need to do is think
about how would you

01:01:09.210 --> 01:01:14.110
stabilize the transition state
relative to the ground state?

01:01:14.110 --> 01:01:16.540
So what we're talking
about is stabilization

01:01:16.540 --> 01:01:21.550
that's unique to the transition
state and not the ground state.

01:01:21.550 --> 01:01:24.510
If you stabilized them
both, what would happen?

01:01:24.510 --> 01:01:44.220
If you stabilized them both--
if you stabilize this guy

01:01:44.220 --> 01:01:48.450
and you stabilize
this guy, the barrier

01:01:48.450 --> 01:01:50.170
would be exactly the same.

01:01:50.170 --> 01:01:54.880
So what you need is some
way to uniquely stabilize

01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:57.951
the transition state
over the ground state.

01:01:57.951 --> 01:01:59.700
So the question is,
how much do you think?

01:01:59.700 --> 01:02:01.116
How much rate
acceleration do you

01:02:01.116 --> 01:02:02.740
think you can get
from a hydrogen bond?

01:02:02.740 --> 01:02:04.070
Does anybody have any idea?

01:02:04.070 --> 01:02:05.490
One hydrogen bond.

01:02:05.490 --> 01:02:10.470
So here, you have a protein
with 1,500 hydrogen bonds.

01:02:10.470 --> 01:02:14.160
But if you can get one
hydrogen bond that's

01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:16.430
here in the transition
state of the reaction,

01:02:16.430 --> 01:02:18.760
that's not over here, how
much rate acceleration

01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:21.820
do you think you can get?

01:02:21.820 --> 01:02:24.870
Anybody got any idea?

01:02:24.870 --> 01:02:29.070
You can get almost 1,000 fold.

01:02:29.070 --> 01:02:32.265
I mean, and you can do a
very simple calculation.

01:02:32.265 --> 01:02:37.320
I can't remember whether I have
this on the-- OK, so that's it.

01:02:40.590 --> 01:02:43.200
So we can do a very
simple calculation,

01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:46.840
and I'll use this to
show you the calculation.

01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:48.210
Here, we have our rate.

01:02:48.210 --> 01:02:51.280
This should be Delta G. The
dagger should be up in the air.

01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:53.590
So this is the
enzymatic reaction.

01:02:53.590 --> 01:02:56.050
This is the
[INAUDIBLE] equation.

01:02:56.050 --> 01:03:00.490
One has the same equation
for non-enzymatic reactions.

01:03:00.490 --> 01:03:03.240
So here's a
non-enzymatic reaction.

01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:05.670
In general, the
non-enzymatic reaction

01:03:05.670 --> 01:03:08.260
can happen by some mechanism.

01:03:08.260 --> 01:03:11.560
To the enzymatic reaction
is just much, much slower.

01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:15.760
So if we assume, for example,
that the rate difference

01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:18.820
between enzymatic and a
non-enzymatic reaction

01:03:18.820 --> 01:03:22.860
is a factor of 10,
how much do you

01:03:22.860 --> 01:03:25.810
get assuming that
all of these terms

01:03:25.810 --> 01:03:29.950
are the same in the enzymatic
and the non-enzymatic reaction?

01:03:29.950 --> 01:03:32.820
You can calculate a
Delta Delta G dagger

01:03:32.820 --> 01:03:35.550
of 1.38 kilocalories per mole.

01:03:35.550 --> 01:03:37.740
For those of you
who are modern, this

01:03:37.740 --> 01:03:39.760
is 5.8 kilojoules per mole.

01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:42.280
Sorry, I'm really
old, so I still

01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:45.180
think in kilocalories per mole.

01:03:45.180 --> 01:03:49.110
But a hydrogen bond, one
hydrogen bond is worth 2 to 7--

01:03:49.110 --> 01:03:51.810
compared to no hydrogen
bond, is worth 2

01:03:51.810 --> 01:03:53.980
to 7 kilocalories per mole.

01:03:53.980 --> 01:03:59.020
So a factor of 10 is 1.4
kilocalories per mole.

01:03:59.020 --> 01:04:02.290
So that shows you, then,
that if you had 2 to 7

01:04:02.290 --> 01:04:04.150
with one hydrogen
bond, it can give you

01:04:04.150 --> 01:04:06.180
these factors of 1,000.

01:04:06.180 --> 01:04:09.100
So I think that's an
observation that's

01:04:09.100 --> 01:04:11.760
something you need to keep
in the back of your mind.

01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:14.160
Because you think about
it over and over again.

01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:18.340
It really doesn't take
much to align everything

01:04:18.340 --> 01:04:19.940
in exactly the right way.

01:04:19.940 --> 01:04:24.930
And when I say hydrogen bond,
these hydrogen bond strengths

01:04:24.930 --> 01:04:29.010
are really dependent on
how everything is aligned.

01:04:29.010 --> 01:04:33.200
If they're exactly aligned, then
you get much stronger bonds.

01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:34.950
They can even approach--
in the gas phase,

01:04:34.950 --> 01:04:38.560
they could approach 30
kilocalories per mole.

01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:40.470
So having everything
aligned, that's

01:04:40.470 --> 01:04:44.220
the job of this
whole big protein,

01:04:44.220 --> 01:04:48.510
to actually give you catalysis.

01:04:48.510 --> 01:04:51.840
And I think I'm at the
end of my lecture now.

01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:54.610
I won't have time to talk
about-- I went over already

01:04:54.610 --> 01:04:56.370
about the question
of specificity.

01:04:56.370 --> 01:04:59.590
But let me just say, I
think enzymes are really

01:04:59.590 --> 01:05:01.620
quite amazing.

01:05:01.620 --> 01:05:03.090
There's nothing like them.

01:05:03.090 --> 01:05:04.800
Faster than a speeding bullet.

01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:09.210
They can catalyze the rates
a million to 10 to the 12, 10

01:05:09.210 --> 01:05:11.640
to the 15-fold.

01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:14.880
And they use really
the simple concepts

01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:17.370
that chemists have
developed over the years.

01:05:17.370 --> 01:05:20.524
But the key to the enzyme
is this big huge molecule,

01:05:20.524 --> 01:05:24.490
and the dynamics within this
molecule that gets everything

01:05:24.490 --> 01:05:29.550
to align exactly right to be
able to lower these barriers so

01:05:29.550 --> 01:05:32.850
that you can convert your
substrate into your product.

01:05:32.850 --> 01:05:35.440
OK guys, see you next time.

01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:37.290
The end.
