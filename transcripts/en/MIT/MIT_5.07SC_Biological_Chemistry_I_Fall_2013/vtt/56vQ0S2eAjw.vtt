00:00:20.486 --> 00:00:24.370
PROFESSOR: Today what I want
to do within the lexicon

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:28.880
is tell you about nature's
most spectacularly beautiful

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.770
cofactors.

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:36.390
And these are formed from
vitamin B-12, which you

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.570
find in your vitamin bottle.

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:39.070
OK.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.920
So what is the structure
of vitamin B-12, and why

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.870
do I say they are
spectacularly beautiful?

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.370
So it's very hard
to see, but if you

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:47.870
look at the structure
of this, where

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.060
have you seen a molecule
this complicated

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.440
with five membered
rings, each of which

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.770
has a nitrogen in this?

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.510
You've seen this when
you studied hemoglobin,

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.720
and you think about heme
and proto protoporphyrin IX.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.050
If you look at the
biosynthetic pathway of heme,

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.530
a branchpoint of that pathway
is to make this ring, which

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.250
is found in adenosylcobalamin
and methylcobalamin, which

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.470
is what we're going to
be focusing on today.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.390
And this ring is
called the corrin ring.

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.630
So what I want to
do is introduce

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.690
you a little bit
to this corrin ring

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.670
and what's unusual about it
compared to protoporphyrin IX

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.810
that you've seen before.

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.130
So the vitamin, as in the case
of all vitamins that we've

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.500
talked about over the
course of the semester,

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.200
is not the actual
cofactor used in

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.190
the enzymatic transformation.

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.450
The vitamin, which in this case
would have this group replaced

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.400
with cyanide, is vitamin B-12.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.570
The actual cofactors
that bind to the enzyme

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.710
have that cyanide replaced
with either a methyl

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.680
group-- and that's
called methylcobalamin--

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.280
or they have it replaced
with 5-prime-deoxyadenosine,

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.690
and that's called
adenosylcobalamin.

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.400
And so the rest of the
molecule is exactly the same.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.230
The only thing that's
distinct is the axial ligands.

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.470
So you remember from your
transition metal chemistry

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.490
you had when you were
freshman that here you

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:29.831
have a cobalt III, and it's
coordinated to four nitrogens.

00:02:29.831 --> 00:02:30.330
OK?

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.450
So this would be the
equatorial plane,

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.540
and we're going to draw it
like this, subsequently,

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.870
because you can see how
complicated this molecule is.

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.232
And the middle sits
right in this plane,

00:02:43.232 --> 00:02:44.690
but you can see
that you don't have

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.280
complete saturation of
these pyrrole- type rings,

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.540
so there's some
pucker in contrast

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.340
with hemes which are very flat.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.180
And then these are called
equatorial ligands,

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.200
and then you have axial ligands.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.610
And so there are
a number of things

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.660
that again I wanted to point
out that are unusual about B-12.

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.460
One is the fact that the
corrin ring again is much more

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.960
reduced than a pyrrole ring.

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.410
And so it's puckered.

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:18.870
And if you look at the visible
spectrum, or you use your eye

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.570
and use your eyeball method,
you see that cyanocobalamin

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.110
is bright purple.

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.860
If you replace this R
group with a methyl group,

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.120
this color turns out to
be sort of yellow-orange.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.020
And if you replace this
with 5-prime-deoxyadenosine,

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:36.330
it turns out to be pink.

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.010
So that's why I say that this
is nature's most spectacularly

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.580
beautiful cofactor.

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.840
So the other thing is you
have two axial ligands.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.010
I just introduced you to
these guys on the top face.

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.120
But what you also see
on the bottom face--

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.900
the bottom axial ligand--
is this unusual structure,

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.620
which is called
dimethylbenzimidazole.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.130
And it's attached to a
ribose, but the unusual thing

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:08.590
is in most nucleosides that
you've encountered like ATP,

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.010
this configuration is
in the beta position--

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:13.490
it's on the top
face of the sugar--

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:15.080
and here it's in
the alpha position.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.320
So that's distinct.

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.430
And the other thing
that's distinct

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.190
is the decorations around
the side chain compared

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.750
to what you see in porphyrins.

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.985
So this is the cofactor we're
going to be talking about,

00:04:29.985 --> 00:04:34.720
and one of the questions
that you're interested in

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.820
is where do we find thes
cofactors in metabolism.

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:43.050
In a mammalian metabolism, the
appearance of these cofactors

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:44.630
is quite limited.

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:50.740
So the only place you see it in
metabolism in mammalian systems

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.950
is you see
methylcobalamin-- OK, where

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:58.120
this is a methyl group-- in
formation of the amino acid

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.040
methionine.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.829
And so the methyl
group from methionine--

00:05:00.829 --> 00:05:02.370
I'll show you briefly
at the very end

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:06.840
of this little presentation--
comes from this methyl group.

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:12.910
You use adenosylcobalamin in
odd chain fatty acid metabolism.

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:17.560
So you have fatty acids that are
either an even or an odd chain.

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.400
When you break the
odd chain ones down,

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.110
you get proprionyl CoA.

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.870
The proprionyl CoA,
through a series of steps,

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:27.770
is converted into
malonyl CoA, which

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.690
then gets converted
to succinyl COA,

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:33.530
which feeds into the TCA cycle.

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:38.750
And in that pathway, you
use an enzyme-- a mutase--

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:40.710
that uses a adenosylcobalamin.

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.300
We'll talk briefly
about the chemistry

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:47.800
of a adenosylcobalamin;
also methylcobalamin.

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:48.300
OK.

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.580
So there were a
few things that I

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.680
wanted to say about-- some
generalizations that I wanted

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:59.740
to make about these cofactors.

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:08.470
And at the first one is
that again, the corrin ring

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:12.310
is much more reduced
than the pyrrole ring

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:18.210
that you see in protoporphyrin
IX, which you've

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:20.900
seen in hemoglobin before.

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.190
The second thing
is that you have

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:26.860
this unusual
dimethylbenzimidazole axial

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:31.290
ligand, which you see nowhere
else in cofactor chemistry.

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:34.700
It's only found in this
particular cofactor.

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.450
The second thing, which I
think is the most amazing,

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:41.890
is that what you see
if you look back here

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:44.740
is that you have-- if
this is a methyl group,

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:47.850
or this is this
5-prime-deoxyadenosine--

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:50.600
you have a carbon cobalt bond.

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.500
Well, this was
discovered in the 1950s,

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:56.910
and the first structure
was solved of this molecule

00:06:56.910 --> 00:07:00.320
by Dorothy Crowfoot
Hodgkin in 1964,

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.510
and she won the Nobel
Prize for this work.

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:06.840
No chemist had ever seen a
carbon cobalt blonde bond,

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:10.520
and thought in fact biochemists
were crazy that they even

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.750
proposed such a structure.

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:14.310
So this structure--
and we'll see

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:16.890
that this is where all
the chemistry happens--

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:18.830
is completely unique.

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:22.230
And people spent 25
years figuring out

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:24.540
how this cofactor
actually worked

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:27.820
to do the transformations that
I'll very briefly introduce you

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:28.320
to.

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:33.460
So this is the first
example of a carbon cobalt--

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:36.630
and will see that cobalt is
in the plus 3 oxidation state

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:45.400
bond-- so it's the first
organo-metallic cofactor.

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:48.690
And what people also found
by studying this molecule

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:52.850
is that the cobalt can actually
exist in three oxidation

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:53.690
states.

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:58.520
It can exist in the
cobalt I state, where

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:01.810
in the d z squared orbital--
if you don't remember what a d

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:04.070
z squared orbital is, you
need to go back and look

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:08.480
at your freshman chemistry--
you have two electrons.

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:14.820
And it turns out that cobalt
I is a super nucleophile.

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:18.940
And we'll see that that plays
a key role in the chemistry.

00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:21.270
And so again, this
is the cobalt. The d.

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:25.600
We're only looking at one of
the orbitals of the cobalt.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:33.130
On the other hand-- and
this is found in methyl--

00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:35.580
this is going to be
used in methylcobalamin.

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:40.340
So when you have a methyl
as the axial ligand,

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:43.760
you're going to use cobalt in
this oxidation state, which

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:45.880
is the plus one state.

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:48.860
For almost all other
B-12 dependent reactions,

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:54.780
you have cobalt II, which
has-- you've lost an electron,

00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:58.630
so you have only one
electron by itself.

00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:00.570
And its d z squared orbital.

00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:03.090
And this really
dictates the chemistry.

00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:08.410
And so this is found in
adenosylcobalamin chemistry.

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:13.320
And then in the resting the
state you have cobalt III.

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:17.120
And cobalt III has none
of the electrons in the d

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.990
z squared orbital.

00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:23.950
And this is basically the
resting state-- its most stable

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:26.260
state-- where you
find this cofactor.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.590
So in cyanocobalamin,
which is vitamin B-12,

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:33.671
the cobalt is in the
plus 3 oxidation state.

00:09:33.671 --> 00:09:34.170
OK.

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:36.530
So we're going to see
very briefly-- we're

00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:41.290
not spending much time on
this-- is the cobalt I state.

00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:42.650
It's a super good nucleophile.

00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:44.900
It affects the chemistry
of the cobalt II state.

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:47.240
It has one unpaired electron.

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:49.380
You haven't been
introduced to chemistry

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:51.000
with one unpaired
electron, which

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.250
is radical chemistry-- that
most people don't spend

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:56.770
a lot of time talking about
adenosylcobalamin because it's

00:09:56.770 --> 00:09:59.090
radicals, and they don't
learn much about radicals

00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:01.360
in introductory
organic chemistry.

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:05.780
But I'll show you briefly
how the enzymes work

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:08.850
that use this cobalt II state.

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:14.500
The other thing I wanted
to mention was the colors.

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:18.640
And so if you want to understand
how these cofactors work,

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:20.100
the different
number of electrons

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:23.060
govern what colors
you can end up seeing.

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:26.360
And again I always use
this is as an example

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:29.550
on MIT'S campus in the spring.

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:35.120
Cobalt II has spectacular orange
color like the orange azaleas,

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:39.630
and cobalt III is
like the pink azaleas.

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:41.580
And so they're really
dramatically different.

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:43.420
And this is why I say
this is nature's most

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:44.710
beautiful cofactor.

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:45.560
OK.

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:52.130
So what I want to do now is
briefly talk about mechanism.

00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:54.900
And I'm going to mostly
talk about mechanism

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:59.380
of the cobalt II state, and
how adenosylcobalamin works,

00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:02.030
since that's the one
that's most complicated.

00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:03.570
So what I'm drawing
here is if we

00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:11.070
look at the structure
of adenosylcobalamin,

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:13.900
you see you have a cobalt
with four nitrogen.

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:15.800
These are the four
nitrogens and these

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:16.970
are the two axial ligands.

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:18.550
So this is the
abbreviation I'm going

00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:21.650
to be using in all the
subsequent chemical

00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:23.740
descriptions of what
I'm talking about, OK?

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:26.290
So I'm not going to draw this
structure out over and over

00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:27.140
again.

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:27.650
OK.

00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:33.770
So here's our adenosylcobalamin
that we just talked about.

00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:35.290
And there's DMB.

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:38.230
It's a dimethylbenzimidazole
axial ligand,

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:40.870
and then you have the
5-prime-deoxyadenosine

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:43.080
in the top face, which is
where all the chemistry is

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:44.060
going to happen.

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:47.390
So the business
end of the molecule

00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:49.550
is going to be this
part of the molecule.

00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:53.430
And the key to everything
is this carbon cobalt bond.

00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:56.240
Now, what's unusual about
a carbon cobalt bond?

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:58.580
It's very weak.

00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:02.560
If you go to 40 degrees,
the bond breaks.

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:04.560
Most things-- you can go
to hundreds of degrees,

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:06.000
and the bond is stable.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.620
So it's thermally labile.

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:11.720
And then the other thing that's
unique about this cofactor

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:16.430
is that it's light sensitive.

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:19.860
So if you put adenosylcobalamin
out on the bench top

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:22.260
here, within two
minutes the whole thing

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:25.870
would be destroyed because you
would break this carbon cobalt

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:26.380
bond.

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:26.900
OK?

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:29.040
And that's the key
to the chemistry

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:31.250
of how this cofactor works.

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:31.960
OK?

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:35.290
So I'm going to give
you a generic mechanism,

00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:38.660
and then I'm going to
focus on the mechanism

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:40.700
of methylmalonyl-CoA
mutase, which

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:43.220
you find in human metabolism.

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:45.330
Before I get started,
let me just show you

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:48.120
what the reaction is and
show you why it's unusual,

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:50.110
and then we'll go back
to the actual mechanism.

00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:50.610
OK.

00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:54.710
So what does
methylmalonyl-CoA mutase do?

00:12:54.710 --> 00:13:00.050
Again it plays a central
role in odd chain fatty acid

00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:02.430
metabolism.

00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:03.900
OK, so this is CoA.

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:05.800
You need to go back and
look at your lexicon

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:09.080
if you can't remember
the structure CoA.

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:10.750
But just remember
it's a thioester.

00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:12.231
That's all you need to know.

00:13:12.231 --> 00:13:12.730
OK.

00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:16.140
So this is the
substrate, and this

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:17.770
is called methylmalonyl-CoA.

00:13:23.301 --> 00:13:23.800
OK.

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:29.735
So adenosylcobalamin
catalyzes rearrangements.

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:36.880
And this reaction has
fascinated chemists for 30 years

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:38.860
because there was no
chemical precedent--

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:41.390
just like there was no chemical
precedent for carbon cobalt

00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:41.890
bonds.

00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:43.460
When biochemists
discovered this,

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:46.220
there was no precedent for the
reaction I'm going to show you.

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:47.430
So what is the reaction?

00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:49.510
It's a rearrangement.

00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:51.800
And it's a rearrangement
because this hydrogen

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:54.650
moves from this
carbon to this carbon.

00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:57.300
And this whole group--
this thioester--

00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:59.750
moves from this
carbon to this carbon.

00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:01.260
So that's the actual reaction.

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.140
It's reversible.

00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:09.298
And so what you do is you
generate succinyl CoA.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.450
OK so this hydrogen
is moved over here.

00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:21.370
And this is succinyl CoA.

00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:24.050
And we haven't
talked about it yet,

00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:26.170
but succinyl CoA
plays a central role

00:14:26.170 --> 00:14:28.610
in metabolism in the TCA cycle.

00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:29.240
OK.

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:31.660
So the question that
we want to focus on now

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:34.000
is how do you catalyze
this weird rearrangement.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.450
What is this cofactor?

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:39.790
This big, huge molecule with
this weak carbon cobalt bond.

00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:40.950
What does it do?

00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:41.690
OK.

00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:44.810
So I'm going to come
back to this in a minute,

00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:46.980
but just let me show
you what it does.

00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:47.480
OK.

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:50.860
So this is a generic
mechanism, because while I

00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:55.220
said there's only one
enzyme in humans that

00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:58.310
uses adenosylcobalamin,
if you move into fungi,

00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:00.500
or you move into
archaea, or bacteria,

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:04.990
you find there are many B-12
dependent reactions that

00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:07.660
also do rearrangements,
but different kinds

00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:08.720
of rearrangements.

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:09.450
OK.

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:11.030
So what's the generic mechanism?

00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:11.530
OK.

00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:14.246
So the generic mechanism
is the following.

00:15:14.246 --> 00:15:16.490
So here we have our
adenosylcobalamin.

00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:18.280
Here's our substrate.

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:18.780
OK.

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:26.301
And the idea is we need to move
the hydrogen from here to here.

00:15:26.301 --> 00:15:26.800
OK?

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:28.980
Does it just jump through space?

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:30.590
And the answer is no.

00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:33.020
The cofactor
adenosylcobalamin is

00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:35.860
going to remove the
hydrogen, and then it's

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:37.770
going to transfer it.

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:39.880
You're going to generate
a reactive speciea,

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:43.450
and then it's going to transfer
it back to form a new product.

00:15:43.450 --> 00:15:46.570
So the cofactor-- and this
took people a long time

00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:49.200
to figure out because there
was no chemical precedent

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:52.480
for this-- is mediating
the hydrogen transfer.

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:56.370
So that's what I'm going to show
you-- how that actually works.

00:15:56.370 --> 00:16:00.150
So here what happens
is the whole key

00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:03.210
to the chemistry of
adenosylcobalamin--

00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:06.860
which again, most of you
haven't seen something like this

00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:13.360
before because you're not
exposed to radical chemistry--

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:18.270
is that you have homolysis
of the carbon cobalt bond.

00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:19.250
So what does that mean?

00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:21.940
It means one electron
goes to the axial ligand,

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:25.190
and one electron
goes to the cobalt.

00:16:25.190 --> 00:16:30.680
So the cobalt III is reduced
from cobalt III to cobalt II,

00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:34.040
and what you're left with
is this radical species

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:42.531
of 5-prime-deoxyadenosyl
radical.

00:16:42.531 --> 00:16:43.030
OK.

00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:45.470
So this is the reactive species.

00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:49.230
Because what you're doing
in these transformations is

00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:53.660
pulling off an amazingly
non acidic hydrogen.

00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:57.670
And normal amino acid side
chains cannot do that kind

00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:58.220
of chemistry.

00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:01.350
You have to go to these
reactive radical species

00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:03.960
to be able to do
this tough chemistry.

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:07.220
So here we generated
a radical species.

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:09.720
It is sitting right
next to the substrate

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:11.450
in the active site
of the enzyme.

00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:12.940
And so what does it do?

00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:17.170
It removes a hydrogen atom--
a hydrogen with one electron.

00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:17.670
OK?

00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:20.859
And so again, this is
free radical chemistry

00:17:20.859 --> 00:17:24.589
that most of you don't
think about that much.

00:17:24.589 --> 00:17:27.380
But what you do is the
hydrogen from the substrate

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:31.260
is now transferred
to this axial ligand

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:33.300
and that stays stuck
in the active site.

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:36.440
So we've seen this
guy move over here.

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:38.700
And now what you've
done is transferred

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:41.440
one radical from the cofactor
into a second radical--

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:42.910
the substrate.

00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:43.410
OK.

00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:44.450
So that's the key.

00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:47.890
Now it's carrying this
hydrogen, and eventually it

00:17:47.890 --> 00:17:51.031
wants to put the hydrogen
back on to form the product.

00:17:51.031 --> 00:17:51.530
OK?

00:17:51.530 --> 00:17:54.200
That's part of the
rearrangement reaction.

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:58.970
So what happens now is--
and this looks like magic.

00:17:58.970 --> 00:18:01.790
I'm just showing that a
substrate radical goes

00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:03.690
to product radical,
and I will show you

00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:06.400
how this works in the case
of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:07.690
in a minute, OK?

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:09.410
So there's some kind
of rearrangement.

00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:12.420
Remember we had two things
rearranging the hydrogen,

00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:16.730
but we also had a second--
a thioester rearranging.

00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:19.200
So we have a
rearrangement reaction,

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:21.960
and this is reversible
in the reaction I'm going

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:24.680
to be talking about today.

00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:27.680
And so this is the same is this.

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:29.250
Structurally these are the same.

00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:31.640
I've just written
the methyl group.

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:33.990
And so we have a
substrate radical

00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:36.320
converting into a
product radical.

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:36.820
OK?

00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:39.940
And now what we want to do
is generate the product.

00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:43.520
And so the hydrogen
from this carrier--

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:46.430
your axial ligand-- is now
going to be transferred

00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:52.060
by hydrogen atom transfer back
to p dot to form the product.

00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:55.800
So again, it's one
electron chemistry,

00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:58.540
and doing one
electron chemistry,

00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:02.710
the hydrogen is transferred back
to p-- and then what do you do?

00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:05.670
You lose one radical, and
you generate another radical.

00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:08.350
You regenerate the
radical we started

00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:12.970
with-- the 5-prime-deoxyadenosyl
radical on the axial ligand.

00:19:12.970 --> 00:19:17.100
Now I have written here
hydrogen in black and in red.

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:18.690
Why is that true?

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:20.870
Because here's a methyl group.

00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:23.070
And if you have free
complete freedom of rotation

00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:25.360
around that carbon
carbon bond, you

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:28.240
can pull off either-- the methyl
hydrogens become equivalent,

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:31.930
so it can pull off a hydrogen
red or a hydrogen black.

00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:32.430
OK?

00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:35.210
Can't distinguish in the
active site of the enzyme.

00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:38.680
So what you now generate is
the same thing we started with,

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:40.090
except we have a product.

00:19:40.090 --> 00:19:42.170
But we have
5-prime-deoxyadenosyl radical

00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:43.070
cobalt II.

00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:45.560
Here we have
5-prime-deoxyadenosyl radical

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:46.670
cobalt II.

00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:50.710
And what you do is you
re-form the carbon cobalt bond

00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:52.810
at the end of every
turnover, and now you're

00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:55.560
ready to start all over again.

00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:57.070
So that's the reaction.

00:19:57.070 --> 00:20:00.280
This 5-prime-deoxyadenosyl
radical.

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:06.430
This axial ligand
sitting over here

00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:09.770
acts as a hydrogen
atom transferring agent

00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:11.920
to remove a hydrogen
from the substrate

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:14.550
and to transfer it
back to the product.

00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:15.404
OK?

00:20:15.404 --> 00:20:17.070
I'm going to show you
how this works now

00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:21.390
in the case of
methylmalonyl-CoA mutase.

00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:25.230
So here's our
methylmalonyl-CoA, and we're

00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:28.180
going to be converted
into succinyl CoA.

00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:32.780
So this guy is migrating, and
this guy is migrating there.

00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:34.030
That's the goal.

00:20:34.030 --> 00:20:38.290
And so what happens here is
you cleave the carbon cobalt

00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:45.070
bond to form cobalt II and
5-prime-deoxyadenosyl radical.

00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:49.300
And now this
5-prime-deoxyadenosyl radical

00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:54.310
can remove a hydrogen
atom from the substrate.

00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:56.280
So it leaves you
with another radical.

00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:57.520
This radical goes away.

00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:59.490
You generate another radical.

00:20:59.490 --> 00:21:02.480
And now this hydrogen
from the substrate

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:05.610
is transferred to our cofactor.

00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:08.430
So it's the hydrogen
transferring agent.

00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:11.000
So now the question is, how
does this weird rearrangement

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:11.560
reaction end?

00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:15.200
How does this CoA migrate
from one place to another?

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:17.050
Again, there was no
chemical precedent

00:21:17.050 --> 00:21:18.640
in the literature for this.

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:20.880
And the answer is we still
don't know the answer.

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:23.960
So there are two
mechanistic possibilities.

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:28.130
One is that you go through a
three membered ring-- cycle

00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:29.620
propane ring intermediate.

00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:31.570
So what you can
picture happening

00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:36.400
is that one of the
electrons from the carbonyl

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:40.960
forms a bond with the unpaired
electron on this carbon.

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:43.760
And you generate this
cycle propane intermediate.

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:46.140
So you've gone from this
radical to another radical.

00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:47.930
We haven't lost any radicals.

00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:52.250
But now what we want to do is
we want this group to migrate.

00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:55.410
So now what happens-- this
intermediate can collapse.

00:21:55.410 --> 00:21:57.220
It can collapse back
to form starting

00:21:57.220 --> 00:22:00.380
material and the
5-prime-deoxyadenosyl radical.

00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:03.230
Or you can break this
bond, in which case

00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:07.600
you collapse to form the direct
precursor to the product.

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:09.790
So it can break down
in either direction,

00:22:09.790 --> 00:22:11.690
and the reaction's reversible.

00:22:11.690 --> 00:22:13.870
And if it breaks down
in this direction,

00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:15.140
you form a new radical.

00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:17.950
This radical is distinct
from this radical.

00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:22.970
And now what happens is that
the hydrogen that you removed

00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:26.510
from your starting material
can be returned back

00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:27.780
to the product.

00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:33.660
And what you generate then is
5-prime-deoxyadenosyl radical

00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:35.870
and cobalt II.

00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:38.820
And now when you transfer
the hydrogen back,

00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:40.910
you form your product
like I showed you

00:22:40.910 --> 00:22:41.940
in the previous slide.

00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:44.830
And now you re-form
the carbon cobalt bond

00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:48.520
to re-form the active
form of the cofactor.

00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:52.800
So alternatively you can
make this arrangement

00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:56.930
happen by another mechanism
which is called a fragmentation

00:22:56.930 --> 00:22:57.519
mechanism.

00:22:57.519 --> 00:22:59.310
And I won't go through
the details of this,

00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:01.518
but you can sit and look at
this for those of you who

00:23:01.518 --> 00:23:05.930
are really interested in
sophisticated proposals

00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:08.910
for the chemical mechanisms
of the rearrangement.

00:23:08.910 --> 00:23:15.710
So adenosylcobalamin chemistry
was unprecedented every step

00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:16.650
along the way.

00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:21.080
And it's now known to be
widely used, but not so much so

00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:21.633
in humans.

00:23:21.633 --> 00:23:25.590
But really humans are only
a small part of the world.

00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:27.460
We have many, many more
bacteria and archaea

00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:28.380
than we have humans.

00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:32.160
So this is a pretty
important transformation.

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:35.620
So hopefully now when
you see this again

00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:38.140
it won't be completely magic.

00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:41.130
But this is a challenging
reaction that most of you

00:23:41.130 --> 00:23:42.550
haven't been exposed to before.

00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:44.580
But hopefully some
of you get excited

00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:47.860
about radical mediated
transformations.

00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:51.660
Just let me close by saying--
from bioinformatic studies

00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:53.790
in the last five
years or so, we now

00:23:53.790 --> 00:23:57.050
know there are over
50,000 reactions that

00:23:57.050 --> 00:23:59.720
use free radical chemistry,
yet we don't talk

00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:02.600
about radical chemistry in 507.

00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:04.960
So hopefully some of you
will get interested enough

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:08.390
in biochemistry to come
in and start figuring out

00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:12.010
how all these radical
dependent reaction occur,

00:24:12.010 --> 00:24:15.680
not in primary metabolism, but
in many secondary metabolic

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:16.631
pathways.

00:24:16.631 --> 00:24:17.130
OK.

00:24:17.130 --> 00:24:18.900
Thank you.
