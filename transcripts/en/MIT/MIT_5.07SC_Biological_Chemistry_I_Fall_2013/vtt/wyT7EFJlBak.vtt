JOHN ESSIGMANN: Welcome
to the metabolism portion

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:25.210
of Biological Chemistry 5.07.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:26.830
My name is John
Essigman and I teach

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:28.840
this course with JoAnne Stubbe.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.640
I'm primarily a
chalkboard teacher,

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.980
as you'll notice from my notes.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.020
In order to make things
as simple as possible,

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.080
I use a lot of abbreviations,
and my abbreviations list

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.090
will be appended elsewhere.

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.760
Let's start by looking at
a metabolic chart, figure

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.370
16-1 from the textbook.

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.680
Obviously it looks very complex.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.930
Part of the challenge of
both teaching and learning

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:51.910
biochemistry is
finding a way to look

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.430
at this pig's breakfast
of biochemical reactions

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.800
and find its
underlying structure.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.200
For the purpose of this course,
the underlying structure

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.070
we're going to look for is
the biochemical pathways

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:04.569
that let us function.

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:07.630
For example, a pathway
could involve making ATP

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.170
or it could be putting an amino
group onto an alpha-keto acid

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.330
in order to make an amino acid.

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.210
Although few people think
of biochemistry as simple,

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.580
formatting the pig's
breakfast into pathways

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.880
that have functional meaning
helps us simplify them and make

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.620
them easier to remember.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.980
The second simplifying point is
that all biochemical pathways

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:28.580
are reversible.

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.420
The gray vertical bar in
the middle of this figure

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.030
is the biochemical
pathway of glycolysis

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.560
going from glucose to pyruvate.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.170
There are 10 steps.

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.030
Some of these steps
have a negative delta

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.360
G. That is, they are favorable
in the direction drawn,

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.110
and some of them
have a positive delta

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.890
G. That is, those
steps are favorable

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.900
in the opposite direction.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.940
But overall, when
you sum them up,

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.790
all of the free energies
of the glycolitic pathway,

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.040
you get a negative
number, which means

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.250
that the pathway of glycolysis
is overall thermodynamically

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.191
irreversible, and progresses
from glucose to pyryvate.

00:02:04.191 --> 00:02:06.190
It turns out that there's
another pathway called

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:07.960
gluconeogenesis.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.470
That pathway involves taking
non carbohydrate precursors,

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.120
such as pyruvate--

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.100
that's just one
example molecule--

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.320
and converting that
precursor to glucose.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.620
In other words,
gluconeogenesis, in effect,

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.380
is the reverse of glycolysis.

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.410
As I said, the pathway going
from glucose down to pyruvate

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:27.880
is exergonic.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.240
So what about the pathway
from pyruvate up to glucose?

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.420
In order to make the pathway
go from pyruvate to glucose,

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.450
what nature did was invent
several biochemical steps that

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.160
are highly exergonic.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.960
That is, what we'll
see is they're

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.730
going to require ATP or some
other form of energy input

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.375
in order to make the entire
pathway of gluconeogeneisis

00:02:50.375 --> 00:02:53.110
exergonic, as is
required of all pathways.

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.810
So we can indeed convert
pyruvate to glucose,

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.330
but it will require
energy input to make

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.600
the pathway of gluconeogenesis
have a net negative delta

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.480
G. That is, be favorable.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.450
The third thing that actually
makes biochemistry tractable

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.960
is the fact that nature uses
only a very limited repertoire

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.760
of chemical reactions.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.070
JoAnne showed us that
despite the complexity

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.050
of this overall
metabolic chart, there

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.620
are only about nine or 10
discrete chemical reactions

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.120
that nature uses.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.630
So, at any given step, for
example, in glycolysis,

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.440
you really only have
about nine or 10 options,

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.700
and of that nine or 10,
only about one or two,

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.720
perhaps three, would be
chemically reasonable.

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.540
If you know your organic
chemistry and these nine or 10

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.120
reaction types, you
should be able to navigate

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.336
the biochemical chart
with comparative ease.

00:03:43.336 --> 00:03:44.710
The fourth point
I wanted to make

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:46.870
is perhaps one of
the most important.

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.750
It's that all biochemical
pathways are regulated.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.730
Chaos would result,
for example, if you

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.740
made glucose and
at the same time

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:56.440
took that molecule of
glucose and degraded it.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.740
That's an example of what
we call a futile cycle.

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:02.530
Sometimes futile cycles can
be beneficial to a cell.

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.440
For example, that could be
a way of generating heat,

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.990
but most of the time
we want to avoid them.

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:10.750
Because we usually want
to avoid futile cycles,

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.750
nature uses pathway
regulation to avoid them.

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.930
To provide directionality to
pathways, what nature does

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.810
is work thermodynamically
irreversible steps

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.080
into the front and back
end of the pathway.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.840
Sometimes nature puts
in an irreversible step

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.910
in the middle of a
pathway if that pathway

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.230
has a branch point.

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:32.990
That happens with
glycolysis, as we'll see.

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.300
Sometimes regulation
is effected by putting

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.510
covalent functionalities,
such as a phosphate,

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.640
onto an amino acid on a protein.

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.010
That modification could
increase or decrease

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.650
the biochemical activity
of that protein.

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.420
Often a phosphorylated
protein is highly active,

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:51.650
turning on a pathway, and
it is dephosphorylated

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.230
when the pathway needs
to be turned off.

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:56.390
A second way to regulate
a step in the pathway

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:00.020
is by allosteric regulation
of the enzymes of the pathway.

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.290
In that case, a small molecule
will interact with the enzyme

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:05.990
in order to increase or
decrease its activity.

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.450
JoAnne taught us about
allostery when she taught us

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:11.000
how hemoglobin is regulated.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.540
To reiterate, nature uses
these regulatable C enzymes

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:17.450
at key places and overall
metabolic pathways

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:19.460
to enable us to
be able to achieve

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.740
the function of the
pathway without wasting

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.550
energy or resources.

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:26.500
The last introductory
point I want to make

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.360
is that all biochemical
pathways tend

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.720
to be compartmentalized, at
least in mammalian cells,

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:34.180
although it's increasingly
becoming obvious that even

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.840
in bacteria there is some
form of compartmentalization.

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.720
That is, clustering of enzymes
for a particular pathway

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.060
in a particular
area of the cell.

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.230
For example, in
a mammalian cell,

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:48.430
the mitochondrian is the site
of fatty acid beta-oxidation,

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:49.540
or break down.

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.390
The tricarboxylic
acid cycle and enzymes

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:56.350
of the pyruvate dehydrogenase
complex are also mitochondrial.

00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:00.610
The cytoplasm is the site where
we do fatty acid biosynthesis,

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.370
most of gluconeogenesis,
glycolysis,

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:05.470
and the pentose
phosphate pathway.

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:08.860
Compartmentalisation helps
keep the metabolic chart

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.504
tidy and organized.

00:06:11.504 --> 00:06:13.170
With that in the way
of an introduction,

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:15.660
let's turn to my lecture
notes, which I present

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:17.690
in the format of storyboards.

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:20.640
In the first
storyboard, panel A,

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.470
I give the definition
of metabolism

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:25.110
as the linked set of
biochemical reactions

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:27.720
by which we obtain
and use free energy.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.930
That is, delta G, for life.

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:33.210
We use that free energy
for a lot of things,

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:36.370
but the use is really
divide into three areas.

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:38.680
The first is to do
mechanical work,

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.310
the second is to generate
concentration gradients,

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:43.560
and the third is
for biosynthesis.

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.570
In a few minutes, I'm
going to be giving you

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:47.980
an example of all three.

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:50.650
Panel B. Biochemists
divide metabolism

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:52.690
into two subcategories.

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:54.340
Catabolism and anabolism.

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:58.690
Briefly, catabolism consists of
the energy yielding pathways,

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:01.600
and anabolism is
basically biosynthesis.

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.570
We use the free energy that
we generate through catabolism

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:09.540
in order to assemble complex
molecules by way of anabolism.

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:11.130
Let's look at panel
C. We're going

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:14.460
to start 5.07 with a
discussion of catabolism.

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:17.040
That is the energy
yielding pathways.

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:19.500
By way of definitions,
a reduced molecule

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.290
is one that is abundantly
supplied with electrons.

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:25.620
Examples are carbohydrates,
fats, and proteins.

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:27.570
These are typically our foods.

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:29.700
The process of
catabolism involves

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:33.300
finding a way to liberate the
electrons from those reduced

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:37.380
substances and transfer those
electrons to mobile electron

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:41.040
carriers, such as
NAD-plus to form NADH,

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:45.090
or NADP-plus to form NADPH.

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:47.970
The process by which electrons
are removed from a molecule

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:50.970
is called oxidation, and
the oxidation products

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:54.060
are, for example, carbon
dioxide that we breathe out,

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:57.030
or in some organisms, lactate,
or other simple molecules

00:07:57.030 --> 00:07:58.230
that are excreted.

00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:01.680
Simple, that is, compared to
the complex reduced molecules

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.810
that we consume as food.

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:08.100
NADH and FADH2, molecules
that JoAnne taught us,

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:11.580
are what I'll refer to as
mobile electron carriers.

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:13.980
They can usually move
around inside the cell,

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:16.530
although sometimes they're
embedded within enzymes.

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:19.590
That is usually the
case with FADH2.

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:23.430
We consume an enormously large
number of reduced substances

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:26.070
due to the complexities
of our diets,

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:28.650
and catabolism involves
taking the electrons out

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:30.990
of this enormously vast
array of substrates

00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:34.799
and transferring those electrons
to a small number of reduced

00:08:34.799 --> 00:08:35.850
electron carriers.

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:38.730
For example, NAD or flavins.

00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:42.059
In the process of respiration,
which we'll come to later,

00:08:42.059 --> 00:08:44.820
the electrons are further
transferred from the reduced

00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:48.370
electron carriers all the
way to molecular oxygen.

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:50.100
The reduction of
molecular oxygen

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:52.440
is a highly exothermic reaction.

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:54.720
We're going to be able
to use the energy that's

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:58.260
generated by oxygen reduction
in order to make ATP,

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.260
and to do some other important
biochemical activities.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.990
Now I'm going to introduce
a physiological scenario

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:07.680
and use it in order to introduce
the pathway of glycolysis.

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.270
In class at this
point, I usually

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:13.010
ask a student to
stand up and sit down.

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:15.260
As you can imagine,
being called on in class

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:18.890
creates more than a little
bit of anxiety in the student.

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:22.250
Let's look at panel D. The
signal to stand up and sit down

00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:25.400
is processed by the brain,
and an electrical signal then

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:28.280
goes by the nerves to the
muscles enabling the student

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:29.810
to stand up.

00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:33.050
The anxiety of being called on
by the teacher in class results

00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:35.930
in a nervous excitation
of the adrenal gland,

00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:38.990
specifically in the adrenal
medulla, which releases

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:40.400
epinephrine.

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.440
Epinephrine is also
known as adrenaline.

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:45.290
It goes to the muscles as well
as other organs of the body,

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:47.630
as we'll see later in 5.07.

00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:50.630
And the epinephrine will
interact at cell membranes

00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:52.670
by way of
transmembrane receptors

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:55.730
in order to turn on
pathways of catabolism,

00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:58.070
in order to generate
the ATP that's

00:09:58.070 --> 00:10:01.910
needed to help the student deal
with this stressful situation.

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:05.840
This is sometimes called the
fight or flight response.

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:09.250
At this point in the class, if
I really wanted to make my point

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:11.690
and have it transferred
to every student,

00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:14.540
I'd announce a pop quiz.

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:16.520
The announcement
of a pop quiz would

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:20.090
cause kind of this cold
feeling throughout your gut.

00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:23.750
That's actually the feeling of
adrenaline preparing your body

00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:26.120
to deal with the stress
situation, in that case,

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:27.600
of the quiz.

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:30.560
Let's look at panel E. As
the scenario progresses,

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:33.200
let me introduce a few
biochemical players.

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:37.040
Glycogen phosphorylase,
glucose, glucose six phosphate,

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:38.685
and glucose one phosphate.

00:10:38.685 --> 00:10:42.110
In panel F we see a muscle cell.

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:44.480
The epinephrine in
the blood is only

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:46.910
going to reach a
concentration of about 10

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:48.650
to the minus 10 molar.

00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:52.290
That's a very, very
low concentration.

00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:54.560
The epinephrine is
going to interact

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:58.440
at the beta and alpha adrenergic
receptors in the muscle cell

00:10:58.440 --> 00:10:59.590
membrane.

00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:01.560
This interaction results
in the activation

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:03.840
of a kinase, that
is a molecule that

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:06.060
transfers a phosphate group.

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:10.560
And that kinase, which is called
SPK, for synthase phosphorylase

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:15.430
kinase, phosphorylate serine
14 on glycogen phosphorylase.

00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:18.780
Phosphorylation activates
glycogen phosphorylase,

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:20.910
which will then begin
to degrade glycogen--

00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:23.820
the polymeric storage form
of glucose in us, that is,

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:24.570
mammals--

00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:27.630
to produce initially
glucose one phosphate.

00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:29.730
Glucose one phosphate
will then go

00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:31.770
through a number
of transformations

00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:35.220
and eventually be converted
into other forms of glucose

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:38.400
and then other molecules
that will generate energy.

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:42.270
In a nutshell, this stand
up, sit down scenario results

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:44.070
in the generation of
energy in a matter

00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:46.080
of seconds which is
one of the things

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:48.750
that we use metabolism for.

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:52.590
Another thing I said earlier was
that you use metabolic energy

00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:55.410
to generate
concentration gradients.

00:11:55.410 --> 00:11:58.320
And it turns out that generation
of concentration gradients

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:01.510
is absolutely critical
for muscle activity.

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:04.110
The sarcoplasmic reticulum
in our muscle cells

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:07.830
must accumulate calcium and
release it at precisely defined

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:11.640
moments in order to enable
the muscle to be able to work.

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:14.730
That concentration grading
of calcium has to be created,

00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:18.450
and it's created with the energy
that we get from metabolism.

00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:20.820
Again, we'll see how
calcium gradients help boot

00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:23.250
up energy generation
in the last lecture,

00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:26.480
which deals with
pathway regulation.
