JOHN ESSIGMANN: Let's take
a look at storyboard 14,

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.500
where I discuss the Q cycle.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.320
If you look back at my previous
lecture in which I introduced

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.820
the respiratory
apparatus, you'll

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.430
see that there are three points
in the electron transport

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.620
chain, at which protons
are translocated

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.260
across the mitochondrial
inner membrane,

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.700
into the intermembrane space.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.070
The three sites are complex one,
complex two, and complex four.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.140
If your entry point
for the electrons

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.810
is a pair of electrons
at NADH, you'll

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.460
translocate about 10 protons.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.670
This generates the
electrochemical gradient

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.530
that will be used in complex
five, the F naught f1 synthase.

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.650
And the energy released in
proton translocation back

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:06.187
into the cytoplasm, eventually
will be used to synthesize ATP.

00:01:06.187 --> 00:01:07.770
At this point, I'd
like to take a look

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.170
at the hypothetical
mechanism by which proton

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.720
translocation into the
intermembrane space

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.150
happens in complex three.

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.790
At the outset, let me say
that the mechanism here

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.070
is different from the
mechanism at complex one

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.150
and complex four.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.900
And I'll also mention that other
organisms have found other ways

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.900
to solve this problem
of translocating protons

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.730
into the intermembrane space.

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.900
Let's look at panel
A of storyboard 14.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.470
At the upper left, we see
coenzyme Q in its quinone form.

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.350
In this form, it's
a taxadiene dione.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.815
It's one of our co-factors.

00:01:41.815 --> 00:01:44.760
And we've also referred to it
in the past as a mobile electron

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:45.840
carrier.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.720
In that regard, it falls into
the same grouping of molecules,

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.860
such as the NAD plus, NADH pair.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.460
The squiggly line
at the lower right

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.730
corner of the quinone molecule
depicts isoprene units.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.040
Actually, there's a
series of about six to 10

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.650
of these isoprenes
in the Q molecule.

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.380
These probably
facilitate association

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.890
with hydrophobic regions,
such as regions in membranes.

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.350
The structure of
coenzyme Q allows

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.690
it to pick up electrons one at
a time from an electron donor.

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.601
And deliver them one
at a time to a place

00:02:15.601 --> 00:02:17.100
where the electrons
are going to go.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.620
That is an electron recipient.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.140
This panel shows the
step-by-step mechanism

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.240
by which electrons,
one at a time,

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.160
can reduce the oxidized form
of coenzyme Q. Called Q here,

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.230
or the quinone, to its fully
reduced form QH2, also known

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.610
as the hydroquinone.

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.520
These electrons come from
complex one, or complex two,

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.550
or another membrane bound
entry point for electrons

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.500
into respiration.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.640
The first electron converts the
quinone Q to the semiquinone

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:48.690
radical.

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.870
The semiquinone will then pick
up another proton and electron

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.050
to form the fully reduced
species, the hydroquinone,

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.020
or QH2.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.920
The hydroquinone QH2 is
fully loaded with electrons.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.740
The fully reduced hydroquinone
will next deliver its two

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.260
electrons to complex three.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.000
The technical name
of complex three

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.500
is coenzyme Q, cytochrome
c oxidoreductase.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.960
This name gives a hint
that the electrons

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.680
are going to pass from
coenzyme Q in its reduced form,

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.890
to an oxidized form
of cytochrome c, which

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.360
is also non-covalently
associated with complex three.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.140
Let's look at panel B. A
single molecule of QH2,

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.720
the hydroquinone, contains
two electrons that

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.480
are going to be transferred
to complex three.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.920
One electron is going to
reduce iron three to iron two,

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.559
in a first molecule
of cytochrome C.

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:43.100
And then the second
electron is going

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.240
to be used to reduce a second
molecule of cytochrome c.

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.730
It's convenient to break
this overall reaction

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:50.880
scheme into two parts.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.020
I'll call them cycle
one and cycle two.

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:55.940
In cycle one, the first
molecule of cytochrome C

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.380
is going to be reduced.

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.720
And then in cycle two,
the second molecule

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.900
will be reduced.

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.130
I've further broken down
the cycle into eight steps.

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.140
At the upper left
of complex three,

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.480
you'll see a site that
I've marked with an x.

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.910
This is an iron
cell for protein.

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.410
This is going to be that docking
site for QH2, the semiquinone.

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.959
Sometimes it is called
the Q delta site.

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:24.910
The reduced quinone, QH2, gives
up two protons and one electron

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.450
to form the semiquinone
radical, Q.minus.

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.610
The electron in
step three goes over

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.430
to reduce ferric ion
to ferrous iron, that

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.180
is iron three to iron
two in cytochrome c.

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.910
As I mentioned
earlier, cytochrome c

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.060
is another one of our
mobile electron carriers.

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.660
It's going to float away
and go off to complex four.

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.900
At this point in step four
B, the semiquinone radical

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.000
is going to give up
its second electron

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.110
to cytochrome bL,
which is a constituent

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.300
of the complex three.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.180
From the standpoint of
coenzyme Q, at this point

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.610
it's lost both of its electrons.

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.190
It has been converted to
the fully oxidized form

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:10.360
Q, as depicted in step
four A. The electron

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.740
at cytochrome bL flows
into cytochrome bH.

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.310
And from there, it
will subsequently

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:20.770
flow into a molecule of the
parental diquinone Q. The one

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.920
electron reduction of
the diquinone Q, results

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.440
in the formation of the
semiquinone radical,

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.230
once again.

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:30.090
This is at position Y--

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:34.980
the way I've drawn the complex
three in panel B. Position Y

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:38.140
is also called the Qi site.

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:40.360
At this point, the
semiquinone radical

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.610
will just stay where it
is for a few minutes.

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:46.540
We'll pick it up again in the
second half of the Q Cycle.

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:49.570
To summarize what happened in
the first half of the Q Cycle,

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:52.810
two protons have been
translocated from the matrix

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:54.910
into the intermembrane space.

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:56.500
And one electron
has been transferred

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:00.250
to cytochrome c, which
then translocates

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:03.580
across the outer surface of the
mitochondrial inner membrane

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.980
to complex four.

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:08.470
At this point, please
look at panel C.

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:11.070
Now we're going to take a look
at the second half of the Q

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:12.040
Cycle.

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:14.200
At the bottom of
complex three in step 1,

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.600
you'll see the orphaned
semiquinone radical

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:17.710
that we just created.

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:20.200
Keep in mind that we
are going to come back

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.070
and use that radical
in a couple of minutes.

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:23.290
So bear with me.

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:25.780
At step two, we see
a second molecule

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:28.850
of the hydroquinone, QH2,
inside the mitochondrial inner

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:29.860
membrane.

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.830
We're going to borrow this
molecule for a short time.

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:34.480
And then we're
going to restore it.

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:37.070
So this QH2 is,
essentially, catalytic

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:39.280
in the overall reaction scheme.

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.340
In step three, we see that
this borrowed molecule

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:47.080
of the hydroquinone, QH2, gives
up two protons and one electron

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.960
just as we had seen in the
first half of the cycle.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.450
You will note that
we are reducing

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:56.200
a second molecule of cytochrome
c, which is then going

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:58.020
to go off to complex four.

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:00.550
And we're also going
to be producing

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:03.850
a second molecule of
coenzyme Q, the fully

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:06.840
oxidized form of the co-factor.

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:09.970
In step four B, the
semiquinone radical, just as

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:12.090
happened in cycle
one, will give up

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:14.650
its electron to cytochrome bL.

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:17.350
The electron will then
go to cytochrome bH,

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:20.650
and then will flow into
the semiquinone radical

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:23.740
that we had left over
from the first cycle.

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:27.310
This radical exists at site
Y, or as I called it before,

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:30.190
the Qi site of complex three.

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:32.800
The reduction of the
semiquinone radical at step six

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:36.160
is concomitant in step
seven with the acquisition

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.680
of two protons from the matrix.

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:41.020
This series of
reactions, ultimately,

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:45.030
results in restoration
of QH2, the semiquinone

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:46.960
in the mitochondrial
inner membrane.

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:49.630
At this point, we have
restored the molecule of QH2,

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:51.850
at step eight, that we
had borrowed, initially,

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:53.260
at step two.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.210
The second cycle
has also produced

00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:58.870
net Q, the oxidized
form of the co-factor,

00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:02.430
which is now free to go on
to complexes one and two,

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:04.990
and to pick up more
reducing equivalents.

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:07.990
Just looking at the second half
of the Q Cycle, what we see

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:10.870
is that we've translocated
another two protons

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:12.850
into the intermembrane space.

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:16.900
And we have transferred a
second electron to cytochrome c.

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:20.500
So cycle one and
cycle two, each,

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.990
result in the translocation
of two protons

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:25.240
from the matrix to the
intermembrane space.

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:28.090
And each results in the
transfer of one electron

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:29.770
to cytochrome c.

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:33.130
Looking at the whole Q Cycle,
that is cycle one and cycle two

00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:37.539
together, we get a pair of
electrons that enter from QH2.

00:08:37.539 --> 00:08:41.320
Four protons are translocated
into the intermembrane space.

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:44.140
And two reduced molecules
of cytochrome c,

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:46.510
which then migrate
to complex four,

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:49.420
where they'll be later oxidized.

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:54.580
Let's turn to storyboard
15 and panel A. In panel A,

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:58.050
I'm showing another way
to look at the Q Cycle.

00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:00.340
I'll emphasize that this
is not as chemically

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:04.290
accurate as the two step process
that I showed you previously.

00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:06.670
And I'm not going to
discuss it here further.

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:08.740
Nevertheless, I think
that this presentation

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:10.810
makes it relatively
easy for you to see

00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:14.850
the overall stoichiometry
of the Q Cycle.

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:18.450
Let's now turn to
storyboard 15, panel B.

00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:22.000
In the way of a high-level
review of electron transport

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.650
so far, electrons from
nutrient oxidation

00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:29.670
have been deposited into the
electron transport chain.

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:32.190
The transfer of
electrons to oxygen

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:35.490
resulted in energy that
is used to power pumps--

00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:39.480
pumps that pump protons into
the intermembrane space.

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:42.480
We've looked at the Q Cycle
as one example, of several,

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:44.970
of how protons are pumped.

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:47.760
It took energy to create
this proton gradient.

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:49.410
When we release
the proton gradient

00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:53.870
by allowing the protons to
flow through the ATP synthase,

00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:56.040
we're going to be able to
use that energy in order

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:58.740
to accomplish the
otherwise energetically

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:03.030
uphill phosphorylation
of ADP into ATP.

00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:06.720
Now let's look at storyboard
15, panel C. This panel

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:11.190
shows the F naught F1 proton
translocating ATP synthase,

00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:13.770
also known as the ATP synthase.

00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:16.020
To put things in
perspective, at the top

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:18.210
is the intermembrane
space, which

00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:20.910
is where the protons
have been translocated.

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:23.610
In the middle is the
mitochondrial inner membrane.

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:26.460
And at the bottom is the
mitochondrial matrix.

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:30.380
Because we've pumped protons
into the intermembrane space,

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:33.030
its pH is about three
quarters of a pH unit

00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:36.810
lower than the pH of the
matrix of the mitochondria.

00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:39.510
Proton flow is going to
be regulated in response

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:41.730
to physiologic needs.

00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:45.610
I'll talk about that regulation
and how it occurs later.

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:49.200
For now, however, let's look at
protons flowing through the F

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.850
naught F1 complex.

00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:52.740
Let's imagine that
the broken line

00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:56.286
indicates a channel, through
which protons will flow.

00:10:56.286 --> 00:10:57.660
Other structural
features include

00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:00.480
a shaft, which I've
indicated as gamma,

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:03.990
and a ring, in which
the shaft is embedded,

00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:06.180
which I've indicated
as the C-ring.

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:09.030
When protons flow, both
the shaft and the C-ring

00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:13.690
will move, as you'll see,
in a clockwise rotation.

00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:15.400
At the bottom of the
overall apparatus

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:18.790
are three alpha and
three beta subunits.

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:20.530
These are not going to rotate.

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:22.270
That is, they're
going to stay fixed

00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:26.272
in position while the C-ring
and the gamma subunit rotate.

00:11:26.272 --> 00:11:29.050
The beta subunit
contains a site x,

00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:32.080
which is going to be the active
site for conversion of ADP

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:34.960
plus inorganic phosphate to ATP.

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:38.890
I've drawn a little elbow on
the bottom of the gamma subunit.

00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:41.080
Let's imagine that
protons are flowing.

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:43.720
And the flow makes that
subunit spin around.

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:45.670
And further, imagine
that the elbow is

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:48.040
bumping into the active sites--

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:49.420
that is, the x sites.

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:51.370
There are three of
the x sites, one

00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:53.230
on each of the b
subunits at the bottom

00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:55.180
of the overall apparatus.

00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:59.500
Imagine that the energy involved
is translocated from the elbow

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:01.150
to the active sites.

00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:05.050
And that's what's going to
help us align ADP and Pi,

00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:08.920
to make the overall
chemical reaction favorable.

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:11.260
That is a hypothetical,
but not far fetched way

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:15.010
to think about the
way that ATP is made.

00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:18.190
Let's now look at panel
D. The current view

00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:21.160
is that the active site
oscillates among three

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:23.260
different conformations
during the time

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.300
the protons are translocated.

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:27.070
These three
conformational states

00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:31.630
are referred to as O for open,
L for loose, and T for tight.

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:35.260
In the open state, nothing is
present at the active site x.

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.240
The conversion of
open to loose is

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:41.620
concomitant with the binding
of ADP and inorganic phosphate.

00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:44.200
As protons continue to
flow, the loose site

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:46.840
is converted into
the tight state.

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:50.020
The energy associated with this
conformational change results

00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:52.810
in the alignment of the
inorganic phosphate,

00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:54.850
such that the conditions
are now favorable

00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:58.300
for it to phosphorylate
ADP and form ATP.

00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:01.780
Further proton flow results in
the tight state being converted

00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:05.620
to the open state, which
ejects the formed ATP out

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:08.090
into the mitochondrial matrix.

00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:12.790
So at each cycle, of
open to loose to tight,

00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:14.980
a molecule of ATP is made.

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:16.780
And then it is ejected.

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:19.520
This goes on again,
and again, and again.

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:23.580
That's the overall mechanism
by which ATP is synthesized.

00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:26.970
At the high level, proton
flow results in the movement

00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:28.420
as the turning of a rotor.

00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:30.000
It is a lot like
a water wheel that

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.030
might drive the rotation of a
millstone, that grinds grain

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:34.530
into flour.

00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:36.840
The rotation of the
shaft provides energy

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:38.970
to bump into the
x sites, resulting

00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:41.160
in the conversion
of a first subunit

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:44.280
to the open conformation,
another subunit

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:49.290
to the loose state, and
a third subunit to tight.

00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:50.970
Then the process
starts over again,

00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:55.050
with each cycle producing
one molecule of ATP.

00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:56.190
As one final point--

00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:59.880
a point that explains how
this process is regulated.

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:03.300
Proton flow results from
the binding of ADP--

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:05.310
that is, ADP.

00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:07.410
This will become
important in a few minutes

00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:11.130
when we talk about how the
whole system is regulated.

00:14:11.130 --> 00:14:13.620
Now let's look at storyboard 16.

00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:16.560
Let's look at all four
panels, panels A through D.

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:18.070
In the last part
of this lecture,

00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:20.010
I'd like to talk
about how respiration

00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:23.280
is coupled to the TCA
cycle and glycolysis.

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:25.314
This is really the
first time in 5.07

00:14:25.314 --> 00:14:26.730
that we're going
to see the beauty

00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:29.250
of coordinated
pathway regulation.

00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:32.190
I'm going to use a
physiological scenario in order,

00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:34.909
hopefully, to make
it all make sense.

00:14:34.909 --> 00:14:37.200
In this scenario, imagine
that you're being chased down

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:39.120
the street by a dog.

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:41.310
In order to start running
away from the dog,

00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:44.490
we're going to need some ATP
that's very quickly generated

00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:46.930
from glucose by glycolysis.

00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:50.040
The TCA cycle is also
going to be operative,

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:52.330
along with a pathway
we haven't seen so far,

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:54.090
fatty acid oxidation.

00:14:54.090 --> 00:14:57.930
In both cases, the TCA cycle
and fatty acid oxidation,

00:14:57.930 --> 00:15:00.580
reduced electron carriers
are going to be produced.

00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:03.150
They're going to give up their
electrons to the electron

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:04.410
transport chain.

00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:08.910
Ultimately, to reduce oxygen
to water and with concomitant

00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:11.860
pumping of protons into
the intermembrane space,

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:13.590
resulting in the
lowering of the pH--

00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:17.890
that is, acidification of
the intermembrane space.

00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:19.690
As I mentioned
earlier, that flow

00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:21.640
of protons through
the ATP synthase

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:23.620
is triggered by
the binding of ADP

00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:27.587
to the x site on the beta
subunit of the enzyme complex.

00:15:27.587 --> 00:15:29.920
As your muscles are working
hard and you're running away

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:32.200
from the dog, the
concentration of ADP

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:35.170
in the mitochondrial matrix
is going to be increasing.

00:15:35.170 --> 00:15:38.650
Thus, proton flow is
going to be initiated.

00:15:38.650 --> 00:15:40.870
As you run more and
more, the protons

00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:43.900
are depleted from the
intermembrane space.

00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:47.500
It's not known exactly how
this reduction in proton

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:49.960
concentration results
in accelerated

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:53.320
movement of electrons through
the electron transport chain.

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:56.050
It's tempting to
speculate that one or more

00:15:56.050 --> 00:15:59.170
of the reductase centers, within
the electron transfer chain,

00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:02.300
may be pH sensitive.

00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:04.420
Let's imagine that
that is the case.

00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:07.030
So let's imagine that
the raising of pH--

00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:10.300
that is, the decrease in
hydrogen ion concentration

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:12.730
in the intermembrane
space, results

00:16:12.730 --> 00:16:16.180
in the facilitated flow of
electrons from complex one

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:18.670
or complex two, to oxygen.

00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:23.500
Next, let's look to the far
left at the bottom of panel D.

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:26.740
As you draw more electrons
into respiration,

00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:30.520
NADH is going to be
converted to NAD plus.

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:34.600
It's important, now, to remember
that NADH feedback inhibits

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:38.070
any step at which it's
produced in the TCA cycle.

00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:40.450
Thus, as you're running
away from the dog,

00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:43.396
the NADH concentration drops.

00:16:43.396 --> 00:16:44.770
And that means
that there's going

00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:48.110
to be less inhibition of
the steps at which NADH

00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:51.340
is produced in the TCA cycle.

00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:54.640
Thus, looking at the
big picture, the binding

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:59.260
of increased concentrations
of ADP to the ATP synthase,

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:02.840
over on the far right, results
in the activation of the TCA

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:05.260
cycle and other
metabolic pathways that

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:07.299
will result in the
delivery of more electrons

00:17:07.299 --> 00:17:09.040
through the electron
transport chain,

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:10.900
in order to allow
you to continue

00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:12.750
to run away from the dog.

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:16.720
Next, let's imagine that you've
been running for quite a while.

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:20.200
And let's look at complex
four, where oxygen is bound.

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:23.470
Sooner or later you're going
to be becoming oxygen limited.

00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:25.329
You're going to be
panting heavily.

00:17:25.329 --> 00:17:28.300
This means that electron
flow from a reduced electron

00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:31.450
carriers to oxygen is
going to slow down.

00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:35.590
As we become more hypoxic,
respiration starts to fail,

00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:38.470
but hypoxia
dramatically increases

00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:41.740
the levels or activities of
the enzymes of glycolysis.

00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:43.990
Thus, glycolysis
will switch over

00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:47.740
to becoming our principal
ATP generation machine.

00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:49.820
As we increase the
rate of glycolysis,

00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:52.360
the flux goes from
glucose to pyruvate,

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:54.880
but the pyruvate
can't be oxidized

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:56.650
because it can't
enter respiration,

00:17:56.650 --> 00:17:59.290
because we don't have enough
oxygen present in order

00:17:59.290 --> 00:18:01.490
to oxidize it.

00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:04.720
So what happens is we
activate lactate dehydrogenase

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:07.300
to convert pyruvate to lactate.

00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:10.790
Conversion of pyruvate to
lactate has two consequences.

00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:13.480
The first is that conversion
results in the conversion

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:15.310
of NADH to NAD plus.

00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:18.190
Remember, that this is
the lactate shuttle.

00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:21.000
And that NAD plus is
now available to allow

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.260
glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate dehydrogenase

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:28.030
to continue processing
molecules of glucose into ATP.

00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:29.830
A second consequence
of activation

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:31.630
of lactate dehydrogenase
is the fact

00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:34.540
that lactate spills out
into the blood, where

00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:35.940
it acidifies the blood.

00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:37.390
The pH drops.

00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:40.150
Now let's think about
what the consequences are

00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:42.610
when the pH of the blood drops.

00:18:42.610 --> 00:18:45.520
I want you to think back to the
lectures in which JoAnne talked

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:48.880
about cooperatively, the
Bohr effect, and the affinity

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:50.730
of oxygen for hemoglobin.

00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:54.910
JoAnne told us that protons
are heterotropic allosteric

00:18:54.910 --> 00:18:58.390
effectors that, effectively,
loosen the affinity of oxygen

00:18:58.390 --> 00:18:59.890
for hemoglobin.

00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:02.950
So as you're running
away from the dog,

00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:05.920
glycolysis becomes
the main pathway.

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:09.040
You produce a lot of lactate
that goes into the blood.

00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:10.570
The pH drops.

00:19:10.570 --> 00:19:13.390
Oxygen lowers its
affinity for hemoglobin,

00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:17.800
and thus, becomes more available
for the pathway of respiration.

00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:22.150
Oxygen is now back in the system
and binds to complex four.

00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:25.930
So you kind of get what we
could call a second wind that

00:19:25.930 --> 00:19:28.690
allows you to continue
using respiration

00:19:28.690 --> 00:19:30.490
to run away from the dog.

00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:33.520
In other words, you've
adapted to the stressful state

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:37.330
and are now able to
continue running.

00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:39.760
Now let's put it all together.

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:41.260
A dog starts chasing you.

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:44.140
Your readily available energy
reserves, and free glucose,

00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:45.640
as well as glycogen,
will produce

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:49.360
rapid ATP that will get you
moving away from the dog.

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:52.720
Additionally, respiration will
be contributing lots of ATP

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:54.640
to allow you to escape the dog.

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:57.640
And as you're running,
ADP concentrations

00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:59.980
will go up inside
your mitochondria.

00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:03.160
That will, basically,
release the proton gradient,

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:07.120
allowing the ATP synthase to
work very quickly and very hard

00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:09.740
to make a lot more ATP.

00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:12.310
NADH concentrations
in the mitochondria

00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:14.710
will drop with
physical activities.

00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:18.250
This helps boot up the
dehydrogenases of the TCA

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:18.820
cycle.

00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:20.830
They become less inhibited.

00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:23.050
Your TCA cycle will
accelerate, in order

00:20:23.050 --> 00:20:25.690
to produce more reducing
equivalents to power

00:20:25.690 --> 00:20:28.030
the electron transport chain.

00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:31.750
All of this will continue until
your oxygen becomes limiting,

00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:37.120
then respiration starts to fail,
but the hypoxic state turns up

00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:39.880
the activities of the
enzymes of glycolysis,

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:44.230
thus glycolysis accelerates
and helps accommodate.

00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:46.810
But pyruvate, at the
end of glycolysis,

00:20:46.810 --> 00:20:49.570
cannot be further oxidized
because there's not enough

00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:53.060
oxygen. It has to be
converted to lactate.

00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:55.420
The lactate acidifies the blood.

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:58.240
The Bohr effect causes
the release of more oxygen

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:01.720
into the blood, making it more
available to complex four,

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:04.840
in order to reboot the
electron transport chain.

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:08.410
Overall, this is a marvelously
regulated physiological system

00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:12.240
that seems to have evolved in
order to promote our survival.
