00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:28.080
PROFESSOR: So as
you recall last time

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.780
we talked about chromatin
structure and chromatin

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.000
regulation.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.390
And now we're going to move
on to genetic analysis.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.160
But before we did that, I
want us to touch on two points

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.440
that we talked about
briefly last time.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.880
One was 5C analysis.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.420
Who was it that brought up--
who was the 5C expert here?

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.010
Anybody?

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.790
No?

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:52.920
Nobody wants to own 5C.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:53.500
OK.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.100
But as you recall, we
talked about ChIA-PET

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.090
as one way of analyzing any
to any interactions in the way

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.370
that the genome folds up and
enhancers talk to promoters.

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.114
And 5C is a very
similar technique.

00:01:06.114 --> 00:01:07.530
I just wanted to
show you the flow

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.260
chart for how the protocol goes.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.950
There is a cross linking.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.720
A digestion with a
restriction enzyme

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.040
step, followed by a
proximity ligation step,

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.900
which gives you molecules
that had been brought together

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.320
by an enhancer, promoter
complex, or any other kind

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.030
of distal protein-protein
interaction.

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:35.660
And then, what happens is that
you design specific timers

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.600
to detect those ligation events.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.150
And you sequence
the result of what

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.390
is known as ligation
mediated amplification.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.730
So those primers are
only going to ligate

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.910
if they're brought together at
a particular junction, which

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.230
is defined by the
restriction sites lining up.

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:58.500
So, 5C is a method of looking
at which regions of the genome

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.170
interact and can produce
these sorts of results,

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.680
showing which
parts of the genome

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.190
interact with one another.

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.630
The key difference, I think,
between chIA-PET and 5C

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.660
is that you actually have to
have these primers designed

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.050
and pick the particular
locations you want to query.

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.110
So the primers that you design
represent query locations

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.840
and you can then either apply
the results to a microarray,

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.710
or to high throughput sequencing
to detect these interactions.

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.900
But the essential
idea is the same.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.540
Where you do proximity
based ligation

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.440
to form molecules that
contain components

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.230
of two different
pieces of the genome

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.270
that have been brought together
for some functional reason.

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.580
The next thing I
want to touch upon

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.500
was this idea of the
CpG dinucleotides

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.930
that are connected
by a phosphate bond.

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.880
And you recall that I
talked about the idea

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.310
that they were symmetric.

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.430
So you could have methyl groups
on the cytosines in such a way

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.810
that, because they could
mirror one another,

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.770
they could be transferred
from one strand of DNA

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.890
to the other strand of DNA,
during cell replication

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.530
by DNA methyltransferase.

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.750
So it forms a more stable kind
of mark and as you recall,

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.750
DNA methylation where
something occurred

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.210
in lowly expressed genes
and typically in regions

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:34.850
of the genome that
are methylated.

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:36.430
Other histone marks
are not present

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.050
and the genes are turned off.

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.680
OK.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.055
So those were the
points I wanted

00:03:41.055 --> 00:03:44.380
to touch upon from last lecture.

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.090
Now we're going to
embark upon an adventure,

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:54.670
looking for the answer to, wear
is missing heritability found?

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.560
So it's a big open
question now in genetics.

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.240
In human genetics,
which is that we really

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.830
can't find all the heritability.

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:06.990
And as a point of
introduction, the narrative

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:10.760
arc for today's lecture is
that, generally speaking,

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.160
you're more like your
relatives than random people

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.480
on the planet.

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:15.770
And why is this?

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:20.529
Well obviously you contain
components of your mom

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:22.089
and dad's genomes.

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:27.800
And they are providing you
with components of your traits.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.580
And the heritability
of a trait is

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.310
defined by the fraction
of phenotypic variance

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:37.830
that can be explained
by genetics.

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.600
And we're going to talk today
about computational models that

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.250
can predict phenotype
from genotype.

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.480
And this is very
important, obviously,

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:51.380
for understanding the sources of
various traits and phenotypes.

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.760
As well as fields such
as pharmacogenomics

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.640
that try and predict the
best therapy for a disease

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.440
based upon your genetic makeup.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:09.110
So, individual
loci in the genome

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.140
that contribute to
quantitative traits

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:17.395
are called quantitative
trait locis, or QTLs.

00:05:17.395 --> 00:05:19.520
So we're going to talked
about how to discover them

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:24.150
and how to build models of
quantitative traits using QTLs.

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.490
And finally, as I
said at the outset,

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.980
our models are
insufficient today.

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:33.150
They really can't find
all of the heritability.

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.730
So we're going to go searching
for this missing heritability

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:39.460
and see where it might be found.

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:44.320
Computationally, we're going to
apply a variety of techniques

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:45.830
to these problems.

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:48.820
A preview is, we're
going to build

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:52.040
linear models of
phenotype and we're

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:56.124
going to use stepwise regression
to learn these models using

00:05:56.124 --> 00:05:57.290
a forward feature selection.

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.210
And I'll talk about
what that is when

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:01.320
we get to that point
of the lecture.

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:04.310
We're going to derive test
statistics for discovering

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:08.530
which QTLs are significant
and which QTLs are not,

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:10.211
to include in our model.

00:06:10.211 --> 00:06:11.960
And finally, we're
going to talk about how

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.200
to measure narrow sense
heritability and broad sense

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.435
heritability in
environmental variance.

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:21.990
OK.

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:30.400
So, one great resource for
traits that are fairly simple.

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:35.600
That primarily are the result
of a single gene mutation,

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:40.040
or where a single gene
mutation plays a dominant role,

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:45.130
is something called Online
Mendelian Inheritance in Man.

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:46.770
And it's a resource.

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:49.690
It has about 21,000
genes in it right now.

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:55.100
And it's a great way to explore
what human genes function

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:57.170
is in various diseases.

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:58.500
And you could query by disease.

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:00.060
You can query by gene.

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:07.130
And it is a very carefully
annotated and maintained

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:10.190
collection that is
worthy of study,

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:13.460
if you're interested in
particular disease genes.

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:19.132
We're going to be looking at
more complex analyses today.

00:07:19.132 --> 00:07:20.590
The analyses we're
going to look at

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:22.275
are where there
are many genes that

00:07:22.275 --> 00:07:23.540
influence a particular trait.

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:25.630
And we would like to come
up with general methods

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:30.902
for discovering how we can de
novo from experimental data--

00:07:30.902 --> 00:07:32.985
discover all the different
genes that participate.

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.910
Now just as a quick
review of statistics,

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:43.660
I think that we've talked
before about means in class

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:44.989
and variances.

00:07:44.989 --> 00:07:46.530
We're also going to
talk a little bit

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:48.732
about covariances today.

00:07:48.732 --> 00:07:50.190
But these are terms
that you should

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:54.210
be familiar with as
we're looking today

00:07:54.210 --> 00:08:01.930
at some of our metrics for
understanding heritability.

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:05.960
Are there any question about any
of the statistical metrics that

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:06.460
are up here?

00:08:09.348 --> 00:08:09.848
OK.

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:16.125
So, a broad overview of
genotype to phenotype.

00:08:18.996 --> 00:08:20.620
So, we're primarily
going to be working

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:24.170
with complete genome
sequences today,

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:26.490
which will reveal all
of the variance that

00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:28.930
are present in the genome.

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:32.264
And it's also the case that
you can subsample a genome

00:08:32.264 --> 00:08:35.070
and only observe
certain variance.

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:37.710
Typically that's
done with microarrays

00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:41.010
that have probes that are
specific to particular markers.

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:42.929
The way those arrays
are manufactured

00:08:42.929 --> 00:08:47.110
is that whole genome sequencing
is done at the outset, and then

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:50.570
high prevalence
variance, at least

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:52.190
common variance,
which typically are

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:55.410
at a frequency of at
least 5% in the population

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:58.390
are queried by
using a microarray.

00:08:58.390 --> 00:09:01.790
But today we'll talk about
complete genome sequence.

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:03.290
An individual's
phenotype, we'll say

00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:05.800
is defined by one
or more traits.

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:09.720
And a non-quantitative trait is
something perhaps as simple as

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:12.590
whether or not something
is dead or alive.

00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:15.820
Or whether or not it can survive
in a particular condition.

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:19.920
Or its ability to produce
a particular substance.

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:22.370
A quantitative trait,
on the other hand,

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:25.274
is a continuous variable.

00:09:25.274 --> 00:09:26.815
Height, for example,
of an individual

00:09:26.815 --> 00:09:28.840
is a quantitative trait.

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:32.610
As is growth rate, expression
of a particular gene,

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:34.490
and so forth.

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:39.310
So we'll be focusing today on
estimating quantitative traits.

00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:41.970
And as I said, a
quantitative trait or loci,

00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:45.240
is a marker that's associated
with a quantitative trait

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:47.160
and could be used to predict it.

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.520
And you can sometimes
hear about eQTLs,

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:52.900
which are expression
quantitative trait loci.

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:55.540
And they're loci that are
related to gene expression.

00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:07.469
So, let's begin then, with
a very simple genetic model.

00:10:07.469 --> 00:10:09.510
It's going to be haploid,
which means, of course,

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:11.218
there's only one copy
of each chromosome.

00:10:11.218 --> 00:10:12.607
Yeast is the model
organism we're

00:10:12.607 --> 00:10:13.940
going to be talking about today.

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:16.190
It's a haploid organism.

00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:18.020
And we have mom
and dad up there.

00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:22.310
Mom on the left, dad on the
right in two different colors.

00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:24.900
And you can see that mom and
dad in this particular example,

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:26.200
have n different genes.

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:29.580
They're going to contribute to
the F1 generation, to junior.

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:37.700
And the relative color is
white for mom, black for dad,

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:41.980
are going to be used to
describe the alleles,

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:44.860
or the allelic variance
that are inherited

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:48.436
by the child, the F1 generation.

00:10:48.436 --> 00:10:50.309
And as I said, a
specific phenotype

00:10:50.309 --> 00:10:52.350
might be alive or dead in
a specific environment.

00:10:55.290 --> 00:11:03.110
And note that I have drawn the
chromosomes to be disconnected.

00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:06.230
Which means that each
one of those genes

00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:09.940
is going to be
independently inherited.

00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:13.160
So the probability
in the F1 generation

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:16.020
that you're going to get
one of those from mom or dad

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:18.420
is going to be a coin flip.

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:19.970
We're going to
assume that they're

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:23.400
far enough away that the
probability of crossing over

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:26.410
during meiosis is 0.5.

00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:28.530
And so we get a
random assortment

00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:32.050
of alleles from mom and dad.

00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:33.130
OK?

00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:37.520
So let us say that you go
off and do an experiment.

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:44.610
And you have 32 individuals
that you produce out of a cross.

00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:47.490
And you test them, OK.

00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:57.130
And two of them are resistant
to a particular substance.

00:11:57.130 --> 00:12:00.155
How many genes do you think are
involved in that resistance?

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:07.885
Let's assume that mom is
resistant and dad is not.

00:12:07.885 --> 00:12:08.385
OK.

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:14.780
If you had two that were
resistant out of 32,

00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:18.350
how many different genes
do you think were involved?

00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:19.635
How do you estimate that?

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:26.970
Any ideas?

00:12:33.667 --> 00:12:34.645
Yes?

00:12:34.645 --> 00:12:39.046
AUDIENCE: If you
had 32 individuals

00:12:39.046 --> 00:12:44.930
and say half of them got it?

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:46.160
PROFESSOR: Two, let's say.

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:51.760
One out of 16 is resistant.

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:53.970
And mom is resistant.

00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:56.940
AUDIENCE: Because I was thinking
that if it was half of them

00:12:56.940 --> 00:13:00.212
were resistant, then you
would maybe guess one gene,

00:13:00.212 --> 00:13:01.170
or something like that.

00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:02.220
PROFESSOR: Very good.

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:04.970
AUDIENCE: So then
if only eight were

00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:09.720
resistant you might guess two
genes, or something like that?

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:11.960
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:15.320
What you say is, that
if mom's resistant, then

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:16.850
we're going to
assume that you need

00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:20.030
to get the right number of
genes from mom to be resistant.

00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:21.390
Right?

00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:25.369
And so, let's say that you had
to get four genes from mom.

00:13:25.369 --> 00:13:27.410
What's the chance of
getting four genes from mom?

00:13:30.236 --> 00:13:33.070
AUDIENCE: Half to
the power of four.

00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:35.290
PROFESSOR: Yeah, which
is one out of 16, right?

00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:39.200
So, if you, for example had two
that were resistant out of 32,

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:41.240
the chances are one in 16.

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:41.960
Right?

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:46.230
So you would naively
think, and properly so,

00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:51.620
that you had to give four
genes from mom to be resistant.

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:54.440
So the way to think
about these sorts

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:57.450
of non-quantitative
traits is that you

00:13:57.450 --> 00:14:00.630
can estimate the number
of genes involved.

00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:02.930
The simply is log
base 2 over the number

00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:07.570
of F1s tested over the number
of the F1s with the phenotype.

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:09.790
It tells you roughly
how many genes

00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:16.160
are involved in providing
a particular trait,

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:18.530
assuming that the
genes are unlinked.

00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:21.415
It's a coin flip, whether
you get them or not.

00:14:21.415 --> 00:14:22.415
Does everybody see that?

00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:26.300
Yes?

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:27.760
Any questions at all about that?

00:14:33.025 --> 00:14:33.775
About the details?

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:38.940
OK.

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:44.400
Let's talk now about
quantitative traits then.

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:47.905
We'll go back to our
model and imagine

00:14:47.905 --> 00:14:50.850
that we have the
same set-- actually

00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:53.110
it's going to a
different set of n genes.

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:56.070
We're going to have
a coin flip as to

00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:58.890
whether or not you're getting
a mom gene or a dad gene.

00:14:58.890 --> 00:15:00.200
OK.

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:05.826
And each gene in dad has
an effect size of 1 over n.

00:15:05.826 --> 00:15:06.326
Yes?

00:15:06.326 --> 00:15:08.618
AUDIENCE: I just
wanted to check.

00:15:08.618 --> 00:15:13.438
We're assuming that the parents
are homozygous for the trait?

00:15:13.438 --> 00:15:14.402
Is that correct?

00:15:14.402 --> 00:15:16.040
PROFESSOR: Remember
these are haploid.

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:17.540
AUDIENCE: Oh, these are haploid.

00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:18.248
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:15:18.248 --> 00:15:23.300
So they only have one
copy of all these genes.

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:24.760
All right.

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:25.774
Yes?

00:15:25.774 --> 00:15:30.220
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] resistant
and they're [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:32.030
That could still
mean that dad has

00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:35.160
three of the four
genes in principle.

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:36.640
PROFESSOR: The previous slide?

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:38.588
Is that where what
you're talking about?

00:15:38.588 --> 00:15:40.527
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
knew about it.

00:15:40.527 --> 00:15:42.360
So really what you mean
is that dad does not

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:44.930
have any of the genes that
are involved with resistance.

00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:45.888
PROFESSOR: The correct.

00:15:48.602 --> 00:15:50.560
I was saying that dad
has to have all of gene--

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:52.670
that the child has to
have all of the genes that

00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:54.290
are operative to
create resistance.

00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:55.750
We're going to
assume an AND model.

00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:58.120
He must have all
the genes from mom.

00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:01.470
They're involved in
the resistance pathway.

00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:04.720
And since only one
out of a 16 progeny

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:08.370
has all those genes
from mom, right, it

00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:11.390
appears that given the chance
of inheriting something from mom

00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:16.040
is 1/2, that it's four genes
you have to inherit from mom.

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:19.787
Because the chance of inheriting
all four is one out of 16.

00:16:19.787 --> 00:16:23.060
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
in which case--

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:27.630
PROFESSOR: No, I'm assuming the
dad doesn't have any of those.

00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:29.660
But here we're asking,
what is the difference

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:32.630
in the number of genes
between mom and dad?

00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:35.520
So you're right, that the
number we're computing

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:39.360
is the relative number of genes
different between mom and dad

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:40.740
you require.

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:43.080
And so it might be
that dad's a reference

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:45.790
and we're asking how many
additional genes mom brought

00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:47.870
to the table to provide
with that resistance.

00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:49.560
But that's a good point.

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:50.060
OK.

00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:54.410
OK.

00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:59.080
So, now let's look at
this quantitative model.

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:04.440
Let's assume that mom has a
bunch of genes that contribute

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:11.089
zero to an effect size
and dad-- each gene

00:17:11.089 --> 00:17:14.640
that dad has produces
an effect of 1 over n.

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:18.560
So the total effect
size here for dad is 1.

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:22.700
So the effect of mom on this
particular quantitative trait

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:23.480
might be zero.

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:25.920
It might be the amount
of ethanol produced

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:28.190
or some other
quantitative value.

00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:31.930
And dad, on the other
hand, since he has n genes,

00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:35.890
is going to produce one,
because each gene contributes

00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:38.275
a little bit to this
quantitative phenotype.

00:17:41.642 --> 00:17:43.050
Is everybody clear on that?

00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:51.550
So, the child is
going to inherit genes

00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:56.290
to our coin flip between
mom and dad, right.

00:17:56.290 --> 00:17:57.880
So the first
fundamental question

00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:01.430
is, how many different
levels are there

00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:04.440
in our quantitative
phenotype in our trait?

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:10.020
How many different
levels can you have?

00:18:16.274 --> 00:18:16.940
AUDIENCE: N + 1?

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:20.270
PROFESSOR: N + 1, right,
because you can either inherit

00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:24.010
zero, or up to n genes from dad.

00:18:24.010 --> 00:18:27.940
And it gets you n plus
1 different levels.

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:29.380
OK.

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:32.410
So, what's the
probability then-- well,

00:18:32.410 --> 00:18:33.660
I'll ask a different question.

00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:38.245
What's the expected value of
the quantitative phenotype

00:18:38.245 --> 00:18:39.060
of a child?

00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:44.700
Just looking at this.

00:18:48.410 --> 00:18:52.860
If dad's one and mom's zero, and
you have a collection of genes

00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:57.507
and you do a coin
flip each time,

00:18:57.507 --> 00:18:59.340
you're going to get
half your genes from mom

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:01.410
and half your genes from dad.

00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:02.990
Right.

00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:11.310
And so the expected
trait value is 0.5.

00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:13.420
So for these added
traits, you're

00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:17.770
going be at the midpoint
between mom and dad.

00:19:17.770 --> 00:19:19.880
Right.

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:28.340
And what is the
probability that you

00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:32.055
inherit x copies of dad's genes?

00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:44.260
Well, that's n choose x, times
1 minus .5 n to the minus

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:47.310
x times 0.5 to the x.

00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:50.080
A simple binomial.

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:51.700
Right.

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:54.980
So if you look at
this, the probability

00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:58.499
of the distribution
for the children

00:19:58.499 --> 00:20:00.040
is going to look
something like this,

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:04.240
where this is the mean, 0.5.

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:09.670
And the number of distinct
values is going to be n plus 1.

00:20:09.670 --> 00:20:12.100
Right.

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:18.860
So the expected value of
x is 0.5 and turns out

00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:26.900
that the expected value, or the
variance of x minus 0.5, which

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:35.012
is the mean squared, is
going to be 0.25 over n.

00:20:35.012 --> 00:20:36.720
So I can show you this
on the next slide.

00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:43.965
So you can see, this could
be ethanol production,

00:20:43.965 --> 00:20:46.700
it could be growth
rate, what have you.

00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:49.210
And you can see that the
number of genes that you're

00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:54.720
going to get from dad follows
this binomial distribution

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:58.810
and gives you a spread
of different phenotypes

00:20:58.810 --> 00:21:00.790
in the child's
generation, depending

00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:03.005
upon how many copies of
dad's genes that you inherit.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.840
But does this make
sense to everybody?

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:11.187
Now would be a great
time to ask any questions

00:21:11.187 --> 00:21:12.270
about the details of this.

00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:13.152
Yes?

00:21:13.152 --> 00:21:15.462
AUDIENCE: Can you
clarify what x is?

00:21:15.462 --> 00:21:17.780
Is x the fraction
of genes inherited--

00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:22.160
PROFESSOR: The number of
genes you inherit from dad.

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:23.790
The number of genes.

00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:27.565
So it would zero,
one, two, up to n.

00:21:27.565 --> 00:21:29.990
AUDIENCE: Shouldn't the
expectation of n [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:32.415
x be n/2?

00:21:32.415 --> 00:21:33.315
PROFESSOR: I'm sorry.

00:21:33.315 --> 00:21:35.810
It is supposed to be n/2.

00:21:35.810 --> 00:21:41.320
But the last two
expectations are

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:44.847
some of the number of genes
you've inherited from dad.

00:21:44.847 --> 00:21:46.835
Right, that's correct.

00:21:46.835 --> 00:21:48.326
Yeah, this slide's wrong.

00:21:55.232 --> 00:21:56.065
Any other questions?

00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:00.220
OK.

00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:06.075
So this is a very simple
model but it tells us

00:22:06.075 --> 00:22:08.550
a couple of things, right.

00:22:08.550 --> 00:22:13.350
Which is that as n
gets to be very large,

00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:16.125
the effect of each gene
gets to be quite small.

00:22:18.650 --> 00:22:21.760
So something could be
completely heritable,

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:26.140
but if it's spread
over, say 1,000 genes,

00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:28.840
then it will be very
difficult to detect,

00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:31.550
because the effect of each
gene would be quite small.

00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:37.300
And furthermore, the variance
that you see in the offspring

00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:40.870
will be quite small
as well, right,

00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:42.450
in terms of the phenotype.

00:22:42.450 --> 00:22:46.170
Because it's going to be 0.25/n
in terms of the expected value.

00:22:46.170 --> 00:22:50.090
So as n gets larger,
the number genes that

00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:52.820
contribute to that
phenotype increase,

00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:54.855
the variance is going
to go down linearly.

00:22:58.580 --> 00:22:59.080
OK.

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:01.390
So we should just
keep this in mind

00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:09.010
as we're looking at discovering
these sort of traits

00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:15.070
and the underlying QTLs that
can be used to predict them.

00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:19.460
And finally, I'd like to point
out one other detail which

00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:21.920
is that, if genes
are linked, that is,

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:25.020
if they're in close proximity
to one another in the genome

00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:26.620
and it makes it very
unlikely there's

00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:29.340
going to be crossing
over between them,

00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:31.876
then they're going
to act as a unit.

00:23:31.876 --> 00:23:38.450
And if they act as a unit, then
we'll get marker correlation.

00:23:38.450 --> 00:23:41.140
And you can also
see, effectively,

00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:42.940
that the effect size
of those two genes

00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:45.520
is going to be larger.

00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:48.500
And in more complicated
models, we obviously

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:52.930
wouldn't have the same
effect size for each gene.

00:23:52.930 --> 00:23:55.250
The effect size might be
quite large for some genes,

00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:56.780
might be quite small
for some genes.

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:04.880
And we'll see the effects
of marker correlation

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:08.150
in a little bit.

00:24:08.150 --> 00:24:12.409
So the way we're going to model
this is we're going to-- this

00:24:12.409 --> 00:24:14.200
is a definition of the
variables that we're

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:17.160
going to be talking about today.

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:21.745
And the essential
idea is quite simple.

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:38.140
So the phenotype of an
individual-- so p sub

00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:40.620
i is the phenotype
of an individual,

00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:45.170
is going to be equal to some
function of their genotype

00:24:45.170 --> 00:24:47.285
plus an environmental component.

00:24:49.890 --> 00:24:57.170
This function is the critical
thing that we want to discover.

00:24:57.170 --> 00:25:00.470
This function, f, is
mapping from the genotype

00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:05.019
of an individual
to its phenotype.

00:25:05.019 --> 00:25:06.560
And the environmental
component could

00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:14.320
be how well something is fed,
how much sunlight it gets,

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:18.910
things that can greatly
influence things like growth

00:25:18.910 --> 00:25:22.550
but they're not
described by genetics.

00:25:22.550 --> 00:25:25.630
But this function is
going to encapsulate

00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:29.150
what we know about
how the genetics

00:25:29.150 --> 00:25:33.145
of a particular individual
influences a trait.

00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:46.710
And thus, if we consider a
population of individuals,

00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:50.250
the phenotypic
variance is going to be

00:25:50.250 --> 00:25:57.220
equal to the genotypic variance
plus the environmental variance

00:25:57.220 --> 00:26:05.295
plus two times the covariance
between the genotype

00:26:05.295 --> 00:26:06.086
in the environment.

00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:12.280
And we're going to assume,
as most studies do,

00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:16.200
that there is no
correlation between genotype

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:17.230
and environment.

00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:19.800
So this term disappears.

00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:23.410
So what we're left with is
that the observed phenotypic

00:26:23.410 --> 00:26:25.660
variance is equal to
the genotypic variance

00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:27.955
plus the environmental variance.

00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:35.870
And what we would like to do
is to come up with a function

00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:41.960
f, that best predicts
the genotypic component

00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:44.340
of this equation.

00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:47.041
There's nothing we can do
about environmental variance.

00:26:47.041 --> 00:26:47.540
Right.

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:53.894
But we can measure it.

00:26:53.894 --> 00:26:55.310
Does anybody have
any ideas how we

00:26:55.310 --> 00:27:00.361
could measure
environmental variance?

00:27:00.361 --> 00:27:00.860
Yes?

00:27:00.860 --> 00:27:02.360
AUDIENCE: Study
populations in which

00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:04.588
there's some kind of
controlled environment.

00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:11.610
So you study populations
that one population

00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:13.610
is one with a homogeneous.

00:27:13.610 --> 00:27:16.332
And another one was a
completely different one.

00:27:16.332 --> 00:27:17.040
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:20.880
So what we could do is
we could use controls.

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:26.290
So typically what we could do is
we could study in environments

00:27:26.290 --> 00:27:28.310
where we try and control
the environment exactly

00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:33.670
to eliminate this as much as
we possibly can, for example.

00:27:33.670 --> 00:27:35.600
As we'll see that we
also can do things

00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:37.590
like study clones,
where individuals

00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:40.770
have exactly the same genotype.

00:27:40.770 --> 00:27:43.340
And then, all of the
variance that we observe--

00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:47.100
if this term vanishes because
the genotypes are identical,

00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:48.370
it is due to the environment.

00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:52.520
So typically, if
you're doing things

00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:56.680
like studying humans, since
cloning humans isn't really

00:27:56.680 --> 00:28:01.670
a good idea to actually
measure environmental variance,

00:28:01.670 --> 00:28:12.110
right, what you could do is you
can look at identical twins.

00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:15.080
And identical twins
give you a way

00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:17.640
to get at the question of
how much environment variance

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:19.325
there is for a
particular phenotype.

00:28:22.110 --> 00:28:28.560
So in sum, this is
replicates what I have here

00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:31.230
on the left-hand
side of the board.

00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:33.177
And note that today
we'll be talking

00:28:33.177 --> 00:28:35.010
about the idea of
discovering this function,

00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:38.120
f, and how well
we can discover f,

00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:39.620
which is really
important, right.

00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:42.530
It's fundamental to be
able to predict phenotype

00:28:42.530 --> 00:28:44.860
from genotype.

00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:51.250
It's an extraordinarily
central question in genetics.

00:28:51.250 --> 00:28:55.510
And when we do the prediction,
there are two kinds of-- oh,

00:28:55.510 --> 00:28:56.480
there's a question?

00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:58.146
AUDIENCE: Could you
please explain again

00:28:58.146 --> 00:29:01.540
why the co-variance drops
out or it goes away.

00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:03.290
PROFESSOR: Yeah, the
co-variance drops out

00:29:03.290 --> 00:29:05.180
because we're going to
assume that genotype

00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:06.513
and environment are independent.

00:29:09.030 --> 00:29:12.220
Now if they're not
independent, it won't drop out.

00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:16.980
But making that assumption--
and of course, for human studies

00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:19.710
you can't really make that
assumption completely, right?

00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:22.020
And one of the problems in
doing these sorts of studies

00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:25.830
is that it's very, very
easy to get confounded.

00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:28.250
Because when you're
trying to decompose

00:29:28.250 --> 00:29:31.694
the observed variance
and height, for example.

00:29:31.694 --> 00:29:35.750
You know, there's what mom and
dad provided to an individual

00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:37.500
in terms of their
height, and there's also

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:40.060
how much junior ate, right.

00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:42.340
And whether he went to
McDonald's a lot, or you know,

00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:44.876
was going to Whole Foods a lot.

00:29:44.876 --> 00:29:46.000
You know, who knows, right?

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.650
But this component
and this component,

00:29:48.650 --> 00:29:50.960
it's easy to get
confounded between them

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:55.330
and sometimes you can
imagine that genotype

00:29:55.330 --> 00:29:58.670
is related to place of
origin in the world.

00:29:58.670 --> 00:30:00.566
And that has a lot to
do with environment.

00:30:00.566 --> 00:30:02.565
And so this term wouldn't
necessarily disappear.

00:30:07.451 --> 00:30:07.950
OK.

00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:09.533
So there are two
kinds of heritability

00:30:09.533 --> 00:30:11.050
I'd like to touch upon today.

00:30:11.050 --> 00:30:14.590
And it's important that you
remember there are two kinds

00:30:14.590 --> 00:30:19.810
and one is extraordinarily
difficult to recover

00:30:19.810 --> 00:30:24.990
and the other one is in some
sense, a more constrained

00:30:24.990 --> 00:30:27.750
problem, because we're much
better at building models

00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:30.430
for that kind of
heritability estimate.

00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:33.810
The first is broad-sense
heritability,

00:30:33.810 --> 00:30:38.560
which describes the upper bound
for phenotypic prediction given

00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:39.980
an arbitrary model.

00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:43.430
So it's the total contribution
to phenotypic variance

00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:45.740
from genetic causes.

00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:47.660
And we can estimate that, right.

00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:51.420
And we'll see how we can
estimate it in a moment.

00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:55.030
And narrow-sense
heritability is defined as,

00:30:55.030 --> 00:30:58.710
how much of the
heritability can we describe

00:30:58.710 --> 00:31:03.750
when we restrict f
to be a linear model.

00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:10.480
So when f is simply linear,
as the sum of terms,

00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:15.000
that describes the maximum
narrow-sense heritability we

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.950
can recover in terms of
the fraction of phenotypic

00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:19.950
variance we can capture in f.

00:31:22.690 --> 00:31:27.820
And it's very useful
because it turns out

00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:32.257
that we can compute both
broad-sense and narrow-sense

00:31:32.257 --> 00:31:33.840
heritability from
first principles-- I

00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:36.590
mean from experiment.

00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:41.860
And the difference between them
is part of our quest today.

00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:44.080
Our quest is, to
answer the question,

00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:45.990
where is the missing
heritability?

00:31:45.990 --> 00:31:52.050
Why can't we build an
Oracle f that perfectly

00:31:52.050 --> 00:31:55.390
predicts phenotype
from genotype?

00:31:58.270 --> 00:32:03.519
So on that line-- I just want
to give you some caveats.

00:32:03.519 --> 00:32:06.060
One is that we're always talking
about populations when we're

00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:07.870
talking about
heritability because it's

00:32:07.870 --> 00:32:10.030
how we're going to estimate it.

00:32:10.030 --> 00:32:13.580
And when you hear people
talk about heritability,

00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:15.550
oftentimes they won't
qualify it in terms

00:32:15.550 --> 00:32:18.030
of whether it's broad-sense
or narrow-sense.

00:32:18.030 --> 00:32:20.170
And so you should
ask them if you're

00:32:20.170 --> 00:32:23.310
engaged in a scientific
discussion with them.

00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:26.750
And as we've already
discussed, sometimes estimation

00:32:26.750 --> 00:32:30.730
is difficult because of matching
environment and eliminating

00:32:30.730 --> 00:32:33.210
this term, the
environmental term

00:32:33.210 --> 00:32:37.260
can be a challenge when
you're out of the laboratory.

00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:40.330
Like when you're
dealing with humans.

00:32:40.330 --> 00:32:43.930
So, let's talk about
broad-sense heritability.

00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:52.980
Imagine that we measure
environmental variants simply

00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:58.650
by looking at environmental
twins or clones, right.

00:32:58.650 --> 00:33:02.470
Because if we, for example,
take a bunch of yeast

00:33:02.470 --> 00:33:04.990
that are genotypically
identical.

00:33:04.990 --> 00:33:07.660
And we grow them up
separately, and we

00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:13.540
measure a trait like
how well they respond

00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:17.870
to a particular chemical
or their growth rate,

00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:21.760
then the variance we see from
each individual to individual

00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:27.850
is simply environmental, because
they're genetically identical.

00:33:27.850 --> 00:33:28.440
So

00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:31.510
we can, in that
particular case, exactly

00:33:31.510 --> 00:33:33.800
quantify the
environmental variance

00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:38.200
given that every individual
is genetically identical.

00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:41.070
We simply measure
all the growth rates

00:33:41.070 --> 00:33:42.450
and we compute the variance.

00:33:42.450 --> 00:33:45.160
And that's the
environmental variance.

00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:47.900
OK?

00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:51.225
As I said for humans, the best
we can do is identical twins.

00:33:53.910 --> 00:33:56.680
Monozygotic twins.

00:33:56.680 --> 00:34:01.320
You can go out and for pairs
of twins that are identical,

00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:04.630
you can measure height or
any other trait that you like

00:34:04.630 --> 00:34:07.370
and compute the variance.

00:34:07.370 --> 00:34:11.239
And then that is an estimate
of the environmental component

00:34:11.239 --> 00:34:16.690
of that, because they should
be genetically identical.

00:34:19.650 --> 00:34:23.300
And big H squared--
broad-sense is always

00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:25.940
capital H squared and
narrow-sense is always

00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:27.420
little h squared.

00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:29.630
Big H squared,
which is broad-sense

00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:32.270
heritability is
very simple then.

00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:35.290
It's the phenotypic variance,
minus the environmental

00:34:35.290 --> 00:34:37.449
variance, over the
phenotypic variance.

00:34:37.449 --> 00:34:40.250
So it's the fraction of
phenotypic experience

00:34:40.250 --> 00:34:44.587
that can be explained
from genetic causes.

00:34:44.587 --> 00:34:46.515
Is that clear to everybody?

00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:52.030
Any questions at all about this?

00:34:55.030 --> 00:34:56.270
OK.

00:34:56.270 --> 00:35:01.030
So, for example, on the
right-hand hand side

00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:04.540
here, those three
purplish squares

00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:09.310
have three different
populations,

00:35:09.310 --> 00:35:12.230
which are genotypically
identical.

00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:15.250
They have two genes, a little a,
a little a, big A, a little A,

00:35:15.250 --> 00:35:19.280
and big A, big A. And each
one is a variance of 1.0.

00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:24.240
out So since there are
genetically identical,

00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:29.340
we know that the environmental
variance has to be 1.0.

00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:33.640
On the left-hand side, you
see the genotypic variance.

00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:37.420
And that reminds us of
where we started today.

00:35:37.420 --> 00:35:40.710
It depends on the number of
alleles you get of big A,

00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:43.390
as to what the value is.

00:35:43.390 --> 00:35:46.110
And when you put all
of that together,

00:35:46.110 --> 00:35:48.920
you get a total variance of 3.

00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:52.840
And so big H squared is
simply the genotypic variance,

00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:55.740
which is 2, over the total
phenotypic variance, which

00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:56.680
is 3.

00:35:56.680 --> 00:35:58.210
So big H squared is 2/3.

00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:04.274
And so that is a
way of computing

00:36:04.274 --> 00:36:05.315
broad-sense heritability.

00:36:09.580 --> 00:36:15.530
Now, if we think
about our models,

00:36:15.530 --> 00:36:18.110
we can see that
narrow-sense heritability

00:36:18.110 --> 00:36:20.150
has some very nice properties.

00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:21.210
Right.

00:36:21.210 --> 00:36:30.175
That is, if we build and
add a model of phenotype,

00:36:30.175 --> 00:36:31.675
to get at narrow-sense
heritability.

00:36:31.675 --> 00:36:37.270
So if we were to constraint
f here to be linear,

00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:40.880
it's simply going to be a
very simple linear model.

00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:46.050
For each particular
QTL that we discover,

00:36:46.050 --> 00:36:49.640
we assign an effect
size beta to it,

00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:52.900
or a coefficient that
describes its deviation

00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:57.330
from the mean for
that particular trait.

00:36:57.330 --> 00:37:00.880
And we have an
offset, beta zero.

00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:03.550
So our simple linear model is
going to take all the discovery

00:37:03.550 --> 00:37:06.270
QTLs that we have--
take each QTL

00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:10.120
and discover which
allelic form it's in.

00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:14.620
Typically it's considered
either in zero or one form.

00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:23.890
And then add a beta j, where
j is the particular QTL

00:37:23.890 --> 00:37:26.220
deviation from mean value.

00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:29.594
Add them all together to
compute the phenotype.

00:37:29.594 --> 00:37:30.950
OK.

00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:36.540
So, this is a very
simple additive model

00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:39.500
and a consequence
of this model is

00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:44.620
that if you think about an
F1 or a child of two parents,

00:37:44.620 --> 00:37:50.740
as we said earlier, a child is
going to inherit roughly half

00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:55.380
of the alleles from mom and
half of the alleles from dad.

00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:58.320
And so for additive
models like this,

00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:04.120
the expected value of
the child's trait value

00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:08.087
is going to be the
midpoint of mom and dad.

00:38:08.087 --> 00:38:10.170
And that can be derived
directly from the equation

00:38:10.170 --> 00:38:13.740
above, because you're
getting half of the QTLs

00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:15.750
from mom and half of
the QTLs from dad.

00:38:18.350 --> 00:38:20.390
So this was observed a
long time ago, right,

00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:30.470
because if you did studies and
you looked at the deviation

00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:35.040
from the midpoint of
parents for human height.

00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:42.320
You can see that the
children fall pretty

00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:49.360
close to mid-parent line,
where the y-axis here

00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:54.980
is the height in inches
and that suggests

00:38:54.980 --> 00:39:04.295
that much of human height can be
modeled by a narrow-sense based

00:39:04.295 --> 00:39:05.160
heritability model.

00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:17.970
Now, once again,
narrow-sense heritability

00:39:17.970 --> 00:39:20.270
is the fraction of
phenotypic variance explained

00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:22.620
by an additive model.

00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:30.690
And we've talked before
about the model itself.

00:39:30.690 --> 00:39:32.770
And little h squared
is simply going

00:39:32.770 --> 00:39:36.100
to be the amount of
variance explained

00:39:36.100 --> 00:39:40.540
by the additive model over
the total phenotypic variance.

00:39:40.540 --> 00:39:45.920
And the additive variance is
shown on the right-hand side.

00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:50.980
That equation boils down to,
you take the phenotypic variance

00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:57.150
and you subtract off the
variance that's environmental

00:39:57.150 --> 00:40:01.260
and that cannot be explained
by the additive variance,

00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:03.885
and what you're left with
is the additive variance.

00:40:09.230 --> 00:40:12.010
And once again, coming
back to the question

00:40:12.010 --> 00:40:15.850
of missing heritability,
if we observe

00:40:15.850 --> 00:40:19.540
that what we can estimate
for little h squared

00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:23.370
is below what we
expect, that gap

00:40:23.370 --> 00:40:24.615
has to be explained somehow.

00:40:27.550 --> 00:40:32.150
Some typical values for
theoretical h squared.

00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:33.800
So this is not
measured h squared

00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:38.020
in terms of building a model
and testing it like this.

00:40:38.020 --> 00:40:40.020
But what we can do is
we can theoretically

00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:43.510
estimate what h
squared should be,

00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:46.585
by looking at the fraction of
identity between individuals.

00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:52.930
Morphological
traits tend to have

00:40:52.930 --> 00:40:55.810
higher h squared for
the fitness traits.

00:40:55.810 --> 00:41:01.320
So human height has a little
h square of about 0.8.

00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:05.300
And for those ranchers
out there in the audience,

00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:08.120
you'll be happy to know that
cattle yearly weight has

00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:10.770
heritability of about 0.35.

00:41:10.770 --> 00:41:14.610
Now, things like life history
which are fitness traits

00:41:14.610 --> 00:41:17.980
are less heritable.

00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:21.980
Which would suggest that looking
at how long your parents lived

00:41:21.980 --> 00:41:24.470
and trying to estimate how
long you're going to live

00:41:24.470 --> 00:41:27.502
is not as productive as
looking at how tall you

00:41:27.502 --> 00:41:28.710
are compared to your parents.

00:41:32.677 --> 00:41:34.260
And there's a complete
table that I've

00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:37.080
included in the slides
for you to look at,

00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:41.050
but it's too small to
read on the screen.

00:41:41.050 --> 00:41:45.020
OK, so now we're going to
turn to computational models

00:41:45.020 --> 00:41:49.660
and how we can discover
a model that figures out

00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:54.870
where the QTLs are, and then
assigns that function f to them

00:41:54.870 --> 00:41:56.870
so we can predict
phenotype from genotype.

00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:04.190
And we're going to be taking
our example from this paper

00:42:04.190 --> 00:42:07.170
by Bloom, et al, which I
posted on the Stellar site.

00:42:07.170 --> 00:42:10.300
And it came out
last year and it's

00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:15.520
wonderful study in QTL analysis.

00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:20.600
And the setup for this
study is quite simple.

00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:23.140
What they did was, is they
took two different strains

00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:28.730
of yeast, RM and BY,
and they crossed them

00:42:28.730 --> 00:42:35.720
and produced roughly 1,000 F1s.

00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:39.750
And RM and BY are very similar.

00:42:39.750 --> 00:42:44.710
They are about, I think
it's about 35,000 snips

00:42:44.710 --> 00:42:46.954
between them.

00:42:46.954 --> 00:42:50.280
Only about 0.5% of their
genomes are different.

00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:52.130
So they're really close.

00:42:55.150 --> 00:42:58.670
Just for point of reference, you
know, the distance between me

00:42:58.670 --> 00:43:03.622
and you is something like
one base for every thousand?

00:43:03.622 --> 00:43:04.455
Something like that.

00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:10.120
And then they assayed
all those F1s.

00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:12.340
They genotyped them all.

00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:14.980
So to genotype
them, what you do is

00:43:14.980 --> 00:43:16.720
you know what the
parental genotypes are

00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:18.980
because they sequence
both parents.

00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:23.250
The mom and dad, so to
speak, at 50x coverage.

00:43:23.250 --> 00:43:25.750
So they knew the genome
sequence is completely

00:43:25.750 --> 00:43:27.780
for both mom and dad.

00:43:27.780 --> 00:43:31.620
And then for each
one of the 1,000 F1s

00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:35.170
they put them on a
microarray and what

00:43:35.170 --> 00:43:38.030
is shown on the
very bottom left is

00:43:38.030 --> 00:43:40.900
a result of genotype
in an individual

00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:44.880
where they can see
each chromosome

00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:47.331
and whether it came
from mom or from dad.

00:43:47.331 --> 00:43:48.830
And you can't see
it here, but there

00:43:48.830 --> 00:43:52.540
are 16 different chromosomes
and the alternating purple and

00:43:52.540 --> 00:43:56.370
yellow colors show whether that
particular part of the genome

00:43:56.370 --> 00:43:59.050
came from mom or from dad.

00:43:59.050 --> 00:44:04.530
So they know for each
individual, its source.

00:44:04.530 --> 00:44:07.000
From the left or
the right strain.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:08.200
OK.

00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:12.150
And they have a thousand
different genetic makeups.

00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:17.010
And then they asked, for each
one of those individuals,

00:44:17.010 --> 00:44:23.420
how well could they grow
in 46 different conditions?

00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:26.610
So they exposed them
to different sugars,

00:44:26.610 --> 00:44:32.130
to different unfavorable
environments and so forth.

00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:36.212
And they measured growth rate
as shown on the right-hand side.

00:44:36.212 --> 00:44:37.920
Or right in the middle,
that little thing

00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:40.800
that looks like a bunch of
little dots of various sizes.

00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:43.420
By measuring colony
size, they could

00:44:43.420 --> 00:44:47.090
measure how well the
yeast were growing.

00:44:47.090 --> 00:44:49.680
And so they had two
different things, right.

00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:53.800
They had the exact genotype
of each individual,

00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:55.520
and they also had
how well it was

00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:59.010
growing in a
particular condition.

00:44:59.010 --> 00:45:01.250
And so for each
condition, they wanted

00:45:01.250 --> 00:45:04.280
to associate the genotype
of the individual

00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:05.582
to how well it was growing.

00:45:05.582 --> 00:45:06.290
To its phenotype.

00:45:09.970 --> 00:45:14.740
Now, one fair question is, of
these different conditions,

00:45:14.740 --> 00:45:18.260
how many of them were
really independent?

00:45:18.260 --> 00:45:20.860
And so to analyze
that, they looked

00:45:20.860 --> 00:45:22.710
at the correlation
between growth rates

00:45:22.710 --> 00:45:26.350
across conditions to try and
figure out whether or not

00:45:26.350 --> 00:45:32.270
they actually had 46 different
traits they were measuring.

00:45:32.270 --> 00:45:35.330
So this is a
correlation matrix that

00:45:35.330 --> 00:45:38.350
is too small to
read on the screen.

00:45:38.350 --> 00:45:41.790
The colors are somewhat
visible, where the blue colors

00:45:41.790 --> 00:45:44.310
are perfect correlation
and the red colors

00:45:44.310 --> 00:45:46.650
are perfect anti-correlation.

00:45:46.650 --> 00:45:50.839
And you can see that in
certain areas of this grid,

00:45:50.839 --> 00:45:52.380
things are more
correlated, like what

00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:57.040
sugars the yeast liked to eat.

00:45:57.040 --> 00:46:01.459
But suffice to say, they
had a large collection

00:46:01.459 --> 00:46:02.875
of traits they
wanted to estimate.

00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:12.720
So, now we want to build
a computational model.

00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:15.030
So our next step
is figuring out how

00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:17.240
to find those places
in the genome that

00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:21.390
allows us to predict,
how well, given a trait,

00:46:21.390 --> 00:46:23.390
the yeast would grow.

00:46:23.390 --> 00:46:26.650
The actual growth rate.

00:46:26.650 --> 00:46:44.110
So the key idea is this-- you
have genetic markers, which

00:46:44.110 --> 00:46:46.670
are snips down the
genome and you're

00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:50.180
going to test a
particular marker.

00:46:50.180 --> 00:46:57.360
And if this is a
particular trait,

00:46:57.360 --> 00:47:01.320
one possibility is
that-- let's say

00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:04.900
that this marker could
be either 0 or 1.

00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:08.310
Without loss of
generality, it could

00:47:08.310 --> 00:47:10.660
be that here are all
the individuals where

00:47:10.660 --> 00:47:12.700
the marker is zero.

00:47:12.700 --> 00:47:19.370
And here are all the markers
where the marker is 1.

00:47:19.370 --> 00:47:25.790
And really, fundamentally,
whether an individual

00:47:25.790 --> 00:47:28.470
has a 0 or a 1 marker,
it doesn't really

00:47:28.470 --> 00:47:33.380
change its growth
rate very much.

00:47:33.380 --> 00:47:34.220
OK?

00:47:34.220 --> 00:47:36.900
It's more or less identical.

00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:50.800
It's also possible
that this is best

00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:57.120
modeled by two different
means for a given trait.

00:47:57.120 --> 00:48:03.780
That when the marker is 1,
you're growing-- actually

00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:10.210
this is going to be the
growth rate on the x-axis.

00:48:10.210 --> 00:48:11.890
The y-axis is the density.

00:48:11.890 --> 00:48:14.970
That you're growing much
better when you have a 1

00:48:14.970 --> 00:48:18.970
in that marker
position than a zero.

00:48:18.970 --> 00:48:22.240
And so we need to distinguish
between these two cases

00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:25.350
when the marker is
predictive of growth rate

00:48:25.350 --> 00:48:28.000
and when the marker is not
predictive of growth rate.

00:48:30.630 --> 00:48:32.770
And we've talked about lod
likelihood tests before

00:48:32.770 --> 00:48:36.060
and you can see one
on the very top.

00:48:36.060 --> 00:48:38.410
And you can see there's an
additional degree of freedom

00:48:38.410 --> 00:48:41.117
that we have in the top
prediction versus the bottom

00:48:41.117 --> 00:48:42.950
because we're using two
different means that

00:48:42.950 --> 00:48:47.530
are conditioned upon
the genotypic value

00:48:47.530 --> 00:48:48.738
at a particular marker.

00:48:53.230 --> 00:48:57.650
So we have a lot of
different markers indeed.

00:48:57.650 --> 00:49:00.980
So we have-- let's see
here, the exact number.

00:49:00.980 --> 00:49:06.770
I think it's about 13,000
markers they had in this study.

00:49:06.770 --> 00:49:07.280
No.

00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:12.620
11,623 different unique
markers they found.

00:49:12.620 --> 00:49:15.500
That they could discover,
that weren't linked together.

00:49:15.500 --> 00:49:18.210
We talked about
linkage earlier on.

00:49:18.210 --> 00:49:23.260
So you've got over
11,000 markers.

00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:26.430
You're going to do
a lod likelihood

00:49:26.430 --> 00:49:29.065
test to compute
this lod odds score.

00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:36.180
Do we have to worry about
multiple hypothesis correction

00:49:36.180 --> 00:49:38.640
here?

00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:41.240
Because you're
testing over 11,000

00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:42.810
markers to see
whether or not they're

00:49:42.810 --> 00:49:45.360
significant for one trait.

00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:45.860
Right.

00:49:52.920 --> 00:50:01.520
So one thing that we could do
is imagine that what we did was

00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:05.970
we scrambled the association
between phenotypes

00:50:05.970 --> 00:50:07.620
and individuals.

00:50:07.620 --> 00:50:11.136
So we just randomized it and
we did that a thousand times.

00:50:11.136 --> 00:50:15.670
And each time we did it, we
computed the distribution

00:50:15.670 --> 00:50:18.330
of these lod scores.

00:50:18.330 --> 00:50:23.400
Because we have broken the
association between phenotype

00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:26.410
and genotype, the
lod scores which

00:50:26.410 --> 00:50:29.680
we should be seeing if we
did this randomization,

00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:33.360
should correspond to
essentially noise.

00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:35.360
But we would see it random.

00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:39.750
So it's a null distribution
we can look at.

00:50:39.750 --> 00:50:44.875
And so what we'll see is a
distribution of lod scores.

00:50:49.410 --> 00:50:51.440
This is the lod.

00:50:51.440 --> 00:51:03.980
This is the probability from
a null, a permutation test.

00:51:03.980 --> 00:51:07.970
And since we actually have
done the randomization

00:51:07.970 --> 00:51:15.725
over all 11,000 markers,
we can directly draw a line

00:51:15.725 --> 00:51:19.960
and ask what are the chances
that a lod score would

00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:25.500
be greater than or equal to
a particular value at random?

00:51:25.500 --> 00:51:27.730
And we can pick an
area inside this tail,

00:51:27.730 --> 00:51:29.660
let's say 0.05,
because that's what

00:51:29.660 --> 00:51:32.590
the authors of this
particular paper used

00:51:32.590 --> 00:51:37.780
and ask what value
of a lod score

00:51:37.780 --> 00:51:42.500
would be very unlikely
to have by chance?

00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:48.330
It turns out in their first
iteration, it was 2.63.

00:51:48.330 --> 00:51:53.500
That a lod score over
2.63 had a 0.05 chance

00:51:53.500 --> 00:51:59.430
or less of occurring in
randomly permuted data.

00:51:59.430 --> 00:52:03.640
And since a permuted data
contained all of the markers,

00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:07.700
we don't have to do any
multiple hypothesis correction.

00:52:07.700 --> 00:52:10.410
So you can directly
compare the statistic

00:52:10.410 --> 00:52:15.520
that you compute
against a threshold

00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:21.330
and accept any marker or QTL
that has a lod score greater,

00:52:21.330 --> 00:52:26.720
in this case then 2.63
and put it in your model.

00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:30.200
And everything else
you can reject.

00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:32.520
And so you start by
building a model out

00:52:32.520 --> 00:52:34.870
of all of the markers
that are significant

00:52:34.870 --> 00:52:36.670
at this particular level.

00:52:39.750 --> 00:52:44.080
You then assemble the
model and you can now

00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:47.860
predict phenotype from genotype.

00:52:47.860 --> 00:52:50.710
But of course, you're going
to make errors, right.

00:52:50.710 --> 00:52:53.490
For each individual, there's
going to be an error.

00:52:53.490 --> 00:53:05.370
You're going to have a residual
for each individual that

00:53:05.370 --> 00:53:15.880
is going to be the
phenotype minus the genotype

00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:18.390
of the individual.

00:53:18.390 --> 00:53:22.200
So this is the error
that you're making.

00:53:22.200 --> 00:53:27.060
So what these folks
did was that you first

00:53:27.060 --> 00:53:34.150
look at predicting the
phenotype directly,

00:53:34.150 --> 00:53:37.620
and you pick all the QTLs that
are significant at that level.

00:53:37.620 --> 00:53:40.097
And then you compute
the residuals

00:53:40.097 --> 00:53:41.680
and you try and
predict the residuals.

00:53:44.700 --> 00:53:49.370
And you try and
find additional QTLs

00:53:49.370 --> 00:53:55.910
that are significant after you
have picked the original ones.

00:53:55.910 --> 00:53:57.410
OK.

00:53:57.410 --> 00:54:02.190
So why might this produce more
QTLs then the original pass?

00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:11.190
What do you think?

00:54:11.190 --> 00:54:14.930
Why is it that trying to
predict the residuals is

00:54:14.930 --> 00:54:17.642
a good idea after
you've tried to predict

00:54:17.642 --> 00:54:18.600
the phenotype directly?

00:54:23.530 --> 00:54:25.168
Any ideas about that?

00:54:34.060 --> 00:54:36.550
Well, what this
is telling us, is

00:54:36.550 --> 00:54:39.640
that these QTLs we're
going to predict now

00:54:39.640 --> 00:54:44.310
were not significant enough
in the original pass,

00:54:44.310 --> 00:54:48.210
but when we're looking at what's
left over, after we subtract

00:54:48.210 --> 00:54:50.660
off the effect of
all the other QTLs,

00:54:50.660 --> 00:54:52.916
other things might pop up.

00:54:52.916 --> 00:54:57.300
But in some sense, we're
obscured by the original QTLs.

00:54:57.300 --> 00:55:00.890
Once we subtract
off their influence,

00:55:00.890 --> 00:55:04.500
we can see things that
we didn't see before.

00:55:04.500 --> 00:55:07.470
And we start gathering
up these additional QTLs

00:55:07.470 --> 00:55:10.340
to predict the
residual components.

00:55:10.340 --> 00:55:13.290
And so they do this three times.

00:55:13.290 --> 00:55:15.650
So they predict the
original set of QTLs

00:55:15.650 --> 00:55:20.390
and then they iterate
three time on the residuals

00:55:20.390 --> 00:55:24.150
to find and fit a linear
model that predicts a given

00:55:24.150 --> 00:55:28.230
trait from a collection of
QTLs that they discover.

00:55:28.230 --> 00:55:29.830
Yes?

00:55:29.830 --> 00:55:30.496
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:55:30.496 --> 00:55:32.670
I'm still confused.

00:55:32.670 --> 00:55:40.328
The second round? [INAUDIBLE]
done three additional times?

00:55:40.328 --> 00:55:41.810
Is that right?

00:55:41.810 --> 00:55:42.798
So the--

00:55:42.798 --> 00:55:45.280
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:47.588
AUDIENCE: Is it done
on the remainder of QTL

00:55:47.588 --> 00:55:50.444
or on the original
list of every--

00:55:50.444 --> 00:55:52.710
PROFESSOR: Each time
you expand your model

00:55:52.710 --> 00:55:55.780
to include all the QTLs you've
discovered up to that point.

00:55:55.780 --> 00:56:01.111
So initially, you discover a
set of QTLs, call that set one.

00:56:01.111 --> 00:56:04.620
You then compute a
model using set one

00:56:04.620 --> 00:56:07.555
and you discover the residuals.

00:56:07.555 --> 00:56:08.505
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:56:08.505 --> 00:56:09.296
PROFESSOR: Correct.

00:56:09.296 --> 00:56:10.890
Well, residual
[INAUDIBLE] so you use

00:56:10.890 --> 00:56:13.425
set one to build a
model, a phenotype.

00:56:16.280 --> 00:56:20.480
So set one is used here
to compute this, right.

00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:21.740
And so set one is used.

00:56:21.740 --> 00:56:23.350
And then you compute
what's left over

00:56:23.350 --> 00:56:26.980
after you've discovered
the first set of QTLs.

00:56:26.980 --> 00:56:30.980
Now you say, we still
have this left to go.

00:56:30.980 --> 00:56:32.380
Let's discover some more QTLs.

00:56:32.380 --> 00:56:35.950
And now you discover
set two of QTLs.

00:56:35.950 --> 00:56:37.260
OK.

00:56:37.260 --> 00:56:41.520
And that set two then is used to
build a model that has set one

00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:44.010
and set two in it.

00:56:44.010 --> 00:56:44.510
Right.

00:56:44.510 --> 00:56:46.200
And that residual
is used to discover

00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:49.850
set three and so forth.

00:56:49.850 --> 00:56:52.790
So each time you're
expanding the set of QTLs

00:56:52.790 --> 00:56:54.860
by what you've discovered
in the residuals.

00:56:54.860 --> 00:56:57.140
Sort of in the trash
bin so to speak.

00:56:57.140 --> 00:56:57.640
Yes?

00:56:57.640 --> 00:57:00.130
AUDIENCE: Each time you're
doing this randomization

00:57:00.130 --> 00:57:01.130
to determine lod cutoff?

00:57:01.130 --> 00:57:02.213
PROFESSOR: That's correct.

00:57:02.213 --> 00:57:04.285
Each time you have to
redo the randomization

00:57:04.285 --> 00:57:05.770
and get to the lod cutoff.

00:57:05.770 --> 00:57:07.502
AUDIENCE: But does
that method actually

00:57:07.502 --> 00:57:10.581
work the way you expect it on
the second pass, given that you

00:57:10.581 --> 00:57:12.205
have some false
positives from the pass

00:57:12.205 --> 00:57:17.052
that you've now
subtracted from your data?

00:57:17.052 --> 00:57:19.135
PROFESSOR: I'm not sure I
understand the question.

00:57:19.135 --> 00:57:21.115
AUDIENCE: So the second time
you do this randomization,

00:57:21.115 --> 00:57:22.739
and you again come
up with a threshold,

00:57:22.739 --> 00:57:27.287
you say, oh, above here
there are 5% false positives.

00:57:27.287 --> 00:57:27.995
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:57:27.995 --> 00:57:31.324
AUDIENCE: But could it be
that that estimate is actually

00:57:31.324 --> 00:57:35.680
significantly wrong based the
fact that you've subtracted off

00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:39.068
false positives before
you do that process?

00:57:41.630 --> 00:57:43.590
PROFESSOR: I mean,
in some sense, what's

00:57:43.590 --> 00:57:46.450
your definition of
a false positive?

00:57:46.450 --> 00:57:46.950
Right.

00:57:46.950 --> 00:57:50.080
I mean it gets down
to that because we've

00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:53.020
discovered there's an
association between that QTL

00:57:53.020 --> 00:57:54.750
and predicting phenotype.

00:57:54.750 --> 00:57:59.230
And in this particular world
it's useful for doing that.

00:57:59.230 --> 00:58:01.860
So it's hard to call something
a false positive in that sense,

00:58:01.860 --> 00:58:03.932
right.

00:58:03.932 --> 00:58:05.390
But you're right,
you actually have

00:58:05.390 --> 00:58:09.327
to reset your
threshold every time

00:58:09.327 --> 00:58:10.785
that you go through
this iteration.

00:58:14.900 --> 00:58:15.650
Good question.

00:58:15.650 --> 00:58:16.316
Other questions?

00:58:19.710 --> 00:58:21.300
OK.

00:58:21.300 --> 00:58:25.160
So, let's see what
happens when you do this.

00:58:25.160 --> 00:58:28.910
What happens is that if
you look down the genome,

00:58:28.910 --> 00:58:30.670
you discover a collection.

00:58:30.670 --> 00:58:42.040
For example, this is
growth in E6 berbamine.

00:58:42.040 --> 00:58:45.130
And you can see the
significant locations

00:58:45.130 --> 00:58:48.590
in the genome, the numbers 1
through 16 of the chromosomes

00:58:48.590 --> 00:58:51.960
and the little red
asterisks above the peaks

00:58:51.960 --> 00:58:54.010
indicate that that was
a significant lod score.

00:58:54.010 --> 00:58:56.729
The y-axis is a lod score.

00:58:56.729 --> 00:58:58.520
And you can see the
locations in the genome

00:58:58.520 --> 00:59:05.030
where we have found places that
were associated with growth

00:59:05.030 --> 00:59:10.010
rate in that
particular chemical.

00:59:10.010 --> 00:59:11.810
OK.

00:59:11.810 --> 00:59:15.890
Now, why is it, do you think,
that in many of those places

00:59:15.890 --> 00:59:20.520
you see sort of a rise and
fall that is somewhat gentle

00:59:20.520 --> 00:59:23.000
as opposed to having
an impulse function

00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:24.400
right at that particular spot?

00:59:30.029 --> 00:59:31.445
AUDIENCE: Nearby
snips are linked?

00:59:31.445 --> 00:59:33.153
PROFESSOR: Yeah, nearby
snips are linked.

00:59:33.153 --> 00:59:37.930
That as you come up to
a place that is causal,

00:59:37.930 --> 00:59:42.000
you get a lot of other
things are linked to that.

00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:44.880
And the closer you get, the
higher the correlation is.

00:59:48.440 --> 00:59:52.910
So that is for 1,000
segregants in the top.

00:59:52.910 --> 00:59:58.550
And what was discovered
for that particular trait,

00:59:58.550 --> 01:00:04.690
was 15 different
loci that explained

01:00:04.690 --> 01:00:10.090
78% of the phenotypic variance.

01:00:10.090 --> 01:00:14.650
And in the bottom,
the same procedure

01:00:14.650 --> 01:00:20.040
was used, but was only
used on 100 segregants.

01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:23.350
And what you can see is that,
in this particular case,

01:00:23.350 --> 01:00:27.330
only two loci were
discovered that explain

01:00:27.330 --> 01:00:28.715
21% of the variance.

01:00:31.450 --> 01:00:33.730
So the bottom study was
grossly under powered.

01:00:36.740 --> 01:00:41.240
Remember we talked about
the problem of finding

01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:45.070
QTLs that had
small effect sizes.

01:00:45.070 --> 01:00:47.230
And if you don't have
enough individuals

01:00:47.230 --> 01:00:49.830
you're going to be under-powered
and you can't actually

01:00:49.830 --> 01:00:51.210
identify all of the QTLs.

01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:57.620
So this is a comparison of this.

01:00:57.620 --> 01:01:00.950
And of course, one of the
things that you don't know

01:01:00.950 --> 01:01:05.010
is the environmental variance
that you're fighting against.

01:01:05.010 --> 01:01:07.160
Because the number
of individuals

01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:11.490
you need, depends both on
the number of potential loci

01:01:11.490 --> 01:01:12.890
that you have.

01:01:12.890 --> 01:01:17.380
The more loci you have, the more
individuals you need to fight

01:01:17.380 --> 01:01:19.210
against the multiple
hypotheses problem,

01:01:19.210 --> 01:01:21.465
which is taken care of by
this permutation implicitly.

01:01:24.870 --> 01:01:28.220
And the more QTLs
that contribute

01:01:28.220 --> 01:01:31.320
to a particular trait,
the smaller they might be.

01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:33.080
And there you need
more individuals

01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:34.900
to provide adequate
power for your test.

01:01:39.810 --> 01:01:43.400
And out of this
model, however, if you

01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:48.090
look at for all the different
traits, the predictive insight

01:01:48.090 --> 01:01:50.040
versus the observed
phenotype, you

01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:52.565
can see that the model
does a reasonably good job.

01:01:56.010 --> 01:02:03.990
So the interesting things
that came out of the study

01:02:03.990 --> 01:02:06.620
were that, first of all,
it was possible to look

01:02:06.620 --> 01:02:11.860
at the effect sizes of each QTL.

01:02:11.860 --> 01:02:16.700
Now, the effect size in terms of
fraction of variance explained

01:02:16.700 --> 01:02:21.590
of a particular marker, is
the square of its coefficient.

01:02:21.590 --> 01:02:23.990
It's the beta squared.

01:02:23.990 --> 01:02:29.350
So you can see here the
histogram of effect sizes,

01:02:29.350 --> 01:02:33.440
and you can see that most
QTLs have very small effects

01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:39.700
on phenotype where phenotype
is scaled between 0 and 1

01:02:39.700 --> 01:02:40.400
for this study.

01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:49.790
So, most traits
as described here

01:02:49.790 --> 01:02:53.690
have between 5 and 29 different
QTL loci in the genome.

01:02:53.690 --> 01:02:56.405
They're used to describe
them with a median of 12.

01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:04.260
Now, the question
the authors asked,

01:03:04.260 --> 01:03:11.280
was if they looked at the
theoretical h squared that they

01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:16.560
computed for the F1s, how
well did their model do?

01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:18.680
And you can see that their
model does very well.

01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:22.630
That, in terms of looking at
narrow sense heritability,

01:03:22.630 --> 01:03:25.560
they can recover almost
all of it, all the time.

01:03:29.860 --> 01:03:35.526
However, the problem comes here.

01:03:35.526 --> 01:03:37.150
Remember we talked
about how to compute

01:03:37.150 --> 01:03:44.430
broad-sense heritability
by looking at clones

01:03:44.430 --> 01:03:47.830
and computing environmental
variance directly.

01:03:47.830 --> 01:03:51.270
And so they were able to
compute broad-sense heritability

01:03:51.270 --> 01:03:55.080
and compare that the
narrow-sense heritability

01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:57.684
that they were able to
actually achieve in the study.

01:03:57.684 --> 01:03:59.475
And you can see there
are substantial gaps.

01:04:02.430 --> 01:04:06.900
So what could be
making up those gaps?

01:04:06.900 --> 01:04:12.380
Why is it that this additive
model can't explain growth rate

01:04:12.380 --> 01:04:15.770
in a particular condition?

01:04:15.770 --> 01:04:20.440
So, the next thing that
we're going to discover

01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:24.680
are some of the sources of this
so-called missing heritability.

01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:26.900
But before I give you
some of the stock answers

01:04:26.900 --> 01:04:29.830
that people in the field give,
since this is part of our quest

01:04:29.830 --> 01:04:33.370
today to actually look
into missing heritability,

01:04:33.370 --> 01:04:36.960
I'll put it to you,
my panel of experts.

01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:39.450
What could be causing this
heritability to go missing?

01:04:39.450 --> 01:04:46.390
Why can't this additive model
predict growth rate accurately,

01:04:46.390 --> 01:04:50.190
given it knows the
genotype exactly?

01:04:50.190 --> 01:04:51.010
Yes.

01:04:51.010 --> 01:04:54.986
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
that you wouldn't

01:04:54.986 --> 01:04:56.980
detect from looking
at the DNA sequence.

01:04:56.980 --> 01:04:59.080
PROFESSOR: So
epidemic factors-- are

01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:00.980
you talking about protein
factors or are you

01:05:00.980 --> 01:05:02.355
talking about
epigenetic effects?

01:05:02.355 --> 01:05:04.117
AUDIENCE: More of
the epigenetic marks.

01:05:04.117 --> 01:05:05.450
PROFESSOR: Epigenetic marks, OK.

01:05:05.450 --> 01:05:09.545
So it might be now, yeast
doesn't have DNA methylation.

01:05:12.490 --> 01:05:15.670
It does have chromatin
modifications

01:05:15.670 --> 01:05:18.020
in the form of histone marks.

01:05:18.020 --> 01:05:20.900
So it might be that there's
some histone marks that

01:05:20.900 --> 01:05:24.750
are copied from generation
to generation that are not

01:05:24.750 --> 01:05:26.310
counted for in our model.

01:05:26.310 --> 01:05:28.330
right?

01:05:28.330 --> 01:05:29.900
OK, that's one possibility.

01:05:29.900 --> 01:05:30.440
Great.

01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:30.940
Yes.

01:05:30.940 --> 01:05:33.874
AUDIENCE: There could
be more complex effects

01:05:33.874 --> 01:05:37.297
so two separate genes may come
out, other than just adding.

01:05:37.297 --> 01:05:38.764
One could turn the other off.

01:05:38.764 --> 01:05:43.170
So it one's on, it
could [INAUDIBLE].

01:05:43.170 --> 01:05:43.910
PROFESSOR: Right.

01:05:43.910 --> 01:05:47.000
So those are called
epistatic effects,

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:48.250
or they're non-linear effects.

01:05:48.250 --> 01:05:51.036
They're gene-gene
interaction effects.

01:05:51.036 --> 01:05:52.410
That's actually
thought to be one

01:05:52.410 --> 01:05:56.915
of the major issues in
missing heritability.

01:06:00.090 --> 01:06:02.570
What else could there be?

01:06:02.570 --> 01:06:03.080
Yes.

01:06:03.080 --> 01:06:03.996
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:06:16.872 --> 01:06:17.580
PROFESSOR: Right.

01:06:17.580 --> 01:06:21.390
So you're saying that there
could be inherent noise that

01:06:21.390 --> 01:06:24.250
would cause there to be
fluctuations in colony size

01:06:24.250 --> 01:06:26.550
that are unrelated
to the genotype.

01:06:26.550 --> 01:06:27.967
And, in fact,
that's a good point.

01:06:27.967 --> 01:06:29.508
And that's something
that we're going

01:06:29.508 --> 01:06:31.530
to take care of with the
environmental variance.

01:06:31.530 --> 01:06:34.580
So we're going to measure
how well individuals

01:06:34.580 --> 01:06:37.900
grow with exactly the same
genotype in a given condition.

01:06:37.900 --> 01:06:40.860
And so that kind of
fluctuation would

01:06:40.860 --> 01:06:43.200
appear in that variance term.

01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:46.010
And we're going to
get rid of that.

01:06:46.010 --> 01:06:48.900
But that's a good thought and
I think it's important and not

01:06:48.900 --> 01:06:53.110
appreciated that there
can be random fluctuations

01:06:53.110 --> 01:06:55.710
in that term.

01:06:55.710 --> 01:06:56.545
Any other ideas?

01:07:02.130 --> 01:07:05.240
So we have epistasis.

01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:06.510
We have epigenetics.

01:07:06.510 --> 01:07:09.170
We've got two E's so far.

01:07:09.170 --> 01:07:10.050
Anything else?

01:07:19.430 --> 01:07:27.870
How about if there are
a lot of different loci

01:07:27.870 --> 01:07:33.860
that are influencing
a particular trait,

01:07:33.860 --> 01:07:37.180
but the effect sizes
are very small.

01:07:37.180 --> 01:07:38.940
That we've captured,
sort of the cream.

01:07:38.940 --> 01:07:40.140
We've skimmed off the cream.

01:07:40.140 --> 01:07:45.110
So we get 70% of the
variance explained,

01:07:45.110 --> 01:07:49.150
but the rest of
the QTLs are small,

01:07:49.150 --> 01:07:50.359
right, and we can't see them.

01:07:50.359 --> 01:07:52.816
We can't see them because we
don't have enough individuals.

01:07:52.816 --> 01:07:54.030
We're underpowered, right.

01:07:54.030 --> 01:07:58.284
We just-- more individuals
more sequencing, right.

01:07:58.284 --> 01:08:00.450
And that would be the only
way to break through this

01:08:00.450 --> 01:08:04.745
and be able to see these
very small effects.

01:08:07.410 --> 01:08:11.630
Because if the effects
are small, in some sense,

01:08:11.630 --> 01:08:13.540
we're hosed.

01:08:13.540 --> 01:08:15.080
Right?

01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:17.859
You just can't see
them through the noise.

01:08:17.859 --> 01:08:24.620
All those effects are
going to show up down here

01:08:24.620 --> 01:08:26.500
and we're going to reject them.

01:08:30.700 --> 01:08:33.645
Anything else, people
can think about?

01:08:36.555 --> 01:08:38.010
Yes?

01:08:38.010 --> 01:08:42.066
AUDIENCE: Could you content
maybe the sum of some areas

01:08:42.066 --> 01:08:48.674
that are-- sorry, the
addition sum of those guys

01:08:48.674 --> 01:08:50.365
that have low effects.

01:08:50.365 --> 01:08:52.604
Or is that not detectable
by any [INAUDIBLE]?

01:08:52.604 --> 01:08:53.979
PROFESSOR: Well,
that's certainly

01:08:53.979 --> 01:08:57.524
what we're trying to do
with residuals, right?

01:08:57.524 --> 01:08:59.149
This multi-round
round thing is that we

01:08:59.149 --> 01:09:01.109
take all the things
we can detect

01:09:01.109 --> 01:09:03.510
that have an effect with
a conservative cut off

01:09:03.510 --> 01:09:05.356
and we get rid of them.

01:09:05.356 --> 01:09:07.189
And then we say, oh,
is there anything left?

01:09:07.189 --> 01:09:10.660
You know, that's hiding, sort
of behind that forest, right.

01:09:10.660 --> 01:09:12.569
If we cut through the
first line of trees,

01:09:12.569 --> 01:09:16.600
can we get to another
collection of informative QTLs?

01:09:21.090 --> 01:09:21.760
Yeah.

01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:23.242
AUDIENCE: I was
wondering if this

01:09:23.242 --> 01:09:24.724
could be an overestimate also.

01:09:24.724 --> 01:09:26.926
Like, for example,
if, when you throw out

01:09:26.926 --> 01:09:28.676
the variance for
environmental conditions,

01:09:28.676 --> 01:09:32.628
the environmental conditions
aren't as exact as we thought

01:09:32.628 --> 01:09:36.860
they were between two yeast
growing in the same set, setup.

01:09:36.860 --> 01:09:37.568
PROFESSOR: Right.

01:09:37.568 --> 01:09:41.026
AUDIENCE: Then maybe you
would inappropriately

01:09:41.026 --> 01:09:43.990
assign a variance to the
environmental condition

01:09:43.990 --> 01:09:51.400
whereas some that could
be, in fact-- something

01:09:51.400 --> 01:09:52.882
that wouldn't be explained by.

01:09:52.882 --> 01:09:55.030
PROFESSOR: And probably
the other way around.

01:09:55.030 --> 01:09:57.000
The other way around
would be that you thought

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:00.522
you had the conditions
exactly duplicated, right.

01:10:00.522 --> 01:10:02.230
But when you actually
did something else,

01:10:02.230 --> 01:10:06.240
they weren't exactly duplicated
so you see bigger variance

01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:07.190
in another experiment.

01:10:07.190 --> 01:10:11.024
And it appears to be
heritable in some sense.

01:10:11.024 --> 01:10:13.190
But, in fact, it would just
be that you misestimated

01:10:13.190 --> 01:10:14.970
the environmental component.

01:10:14.970 --> 01:10:16.870
So, there are a
variety of things

01:10:16.870 --> 01:10:19.000
that we can think about, right.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:20.870
Incorrect heritability
estimates.

01:10:20.870 --> 01:10:23.605
We can think about
rare variance.

01:10:23.605 --> 01:10:25.230
Now in this
particular study we're

01:10:25.230 --> 01:10:27.240
looking at everything, right.

01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:28.330
Nothing is hiding.

01:10:28.330 --> 01:10:30.040
We've got 50x sequencing.

01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:32.400
There are no variants
hiding behind the bushes.

01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:35.080
They are all there
for us to look at.

01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:37.290
Structural variants-- well
in this particular case,

01:10:37.290 --> 01:10:39.770
we know structural
variants aren't present,

01:10:39.770 --> 01:10:42.290
but as you know, many
kinds of mammalian cells

01:10:42.290 --> 01:10:45.470
exhibit structural
variance and other kinds

01:10:45.470 --> 01:10:50.480
of bizarre behaviors
with their chromosomes.

01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:52.280
Many common variants
of low effect.

01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:54.520
We just talked about that.

01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:56.420
And epistasis was brought up.

01:10:56.420 --> 01:10:58.140
And this does not
include epigenetics,

01:10:58.140 --> 01:10:59.720
I'll have to add
that to the listen.

01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:01.490
It's a good point.

01:11:01.490 --> 01:11:03.050
OK.

01:11:03.050 --> 01:11:04.650
And then we talked
about this idea

01:11:04.650 --> 01:11:10.460
that epistasis is the case
where we have nonlinear effects.

01:11:10.460 --> 01:11:14.970
So a very simple
example of this is

01:11:14.970 --> 01:11:17.570
when you have little a and
big B, and big A and big B

01:11:17.570 --> 01:11:19.210
together, they
both had an effect.

01:11:19.210 --> 01:11:22.090
But little a, little
b, have no effect.

01:11:22.090 --> 01:11:25.110
And big A and big B have
no effect by themselves.

01:11:25.110 --> 01:11:26.780
So you have a
pairwise interaction

01:11:26.780 --> 01:11:28.750
between these terms.

01:11:28.750 --> 01:11:29.940
Right.

01:11:29.940 --> 01:11:33.670
So this is sort of the
exclusive OR of two terms

01:11:33.670 --> 01:11:36.420
and that non-linear
effect can never

01:11:36.420 --> 01:11:40.990
be captured when you're
looking at terms one at a time.

01:11:40.990 --> 01:11:42.650
OK.

01:11:42.650 --> 01:11:46.200
Because looking
one at a time looks

01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:49.310
like it has no
effect whatsoever.

01:11:49.310 --> 01:11:52.060
And these effects, of course,
could be more than pairwise,

01:11:52.060 --> 01:11:54.075
if you have a complicated
network or pathway.

01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:03.780
Now, what the authors
did to examine this,

01:12:03.780 --> 01:12:07.610
is they looked at
pairwise effects.

01:12:07.610 --> 01:12:10.710
So they considered
all pairs of markers

01:12:10.710 --> 01:12:14.170
and asked whether or not,
taken two at a time now,

01:12:14.170 --> 01:12:20.930
they could predict a
difference in trait need.

01:12:20.930 --> 01:12:22.547
But what's the
problem with this?

01:12:22.547 --> 01:12:24.130
How many markers did
I say there were?

01:12:28.140 --> 01:12:31.630
13,000, something like that.

01:12:31.630 --> 01:12:35.160
All pairs of markers is a
lot of pairs of markers.

01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:36.600
Right.

01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:39.100
And what happens to
your statistical power

01:12:39.100 --> 01:12:42.320
when you get to
that many markers?

01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:43.590
You have a serious problem.

01:12:43.590 --> 01:12:45.620
It goes right through the floor.

01:12:45.620 --> 01:12:48.450
So you really are very
under-powered to detect

01:12:48.450 --> 01:12:50.820
these interactions.

01:12:50.820 --> 01:12:53.250
The other thing
they did was to try

01:12:53.250 --> 01:12:55.450
to get things a little
bit better as they said,

01:12:55.450 --> 01:12:57.780
how about this.

01:12:57.780 --> 01:13:02.610
If we know that a given QTL is
always important for a trait

01:13:02.610 --> 01:13:05.980
because we discovered it
in our additive model.

01:13:05.980 --> 01:13:07.690
Well consider its
pairwise interaction

01:13:07.690 --> 01:13:10.980
with all the other
possible variants.

01:13:10.980 --> 01:13:13.870
So instead of now
13,000 squared,

01:13:13.870 --> 01:13:17.430
it's only going to be like
22 different QTLs for a given

01:13:17.430 --> 01:13:23.540
trait times 13,000 to
reduce the space of search.

01:13:23.540 --> 01:13:26.410
Obviously I got this explanation
not completely clear.

01:13:26.410 --> 01:13:27.880
So let me try one more time.

01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:30.460
OK.

01:13:30.460 --> 01:13:33.040
The naive way to go at looking
at pairwise interactions

01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:35.570
is consider all pairs
and ask whether or not

01:13:35.570 --> 01:13:38.860
all pairs have an influence
on a particular trait value.

01:13:38.860 --> 01:13:39.390
Right.

01:13:39.390 --> 01:13:40.430
We've got that much?

01:13:40.430 --> 01:13:41.330
OK.

01:13:41.330 --> 01:13:44.100
Now let's suppose we don't
want to look at all pairs.

01:13:44.100 --> 01:13:46.570
How could we pick one
element of the pair

01:13:46.570 --> 01:13:50.082
to be interesting,
but smaller in number?

01:13:50.082 --> 01:13:50.940
Right.

01:13:50.940 --> 01:13:53.370
So what we'll do is,
for a given trait,

01:13:53.370 --> 01:13:57.610
we already know which
QTLs are important for it

01:13:57.610 --> 01:14:00.406
because we've built
our model already.

01:14:00.406 --> 01:14:02.280
So let's just say, for
purpose of discussion,

01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:06.150
there are 20 QTLs that are
important for this trait.

01:14:06.150 --> 01:14:09.010
We'll take each one
of those 20 QTLs

01:14:09.010 --> 01:14:11.870
and we'll examine whether or not
it has a pairwise interaction

01:14:11.870 --> 01:14:14.960
with all of the other variance.

01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:18.220
And that will reduce
our search base.

01:14:18.220 --> 01:14:19.500
Is that better?

01:14:19.500 --> 01:14:21.000
OK, good.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:27.800
So, when they did
that, they did find

01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:30.830
some pairwise interactions.

01:14:30.830 --> 01:14:35.940
In 24 of their 46 traits
had pairwise interactions

01:14:35.940 --> 01:14:36.935
and here is an example.

01:14:40.200 --> 01:14:48.640
And you can see the dot plot,
or the upper right-hand part

01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:52.710
of this slide,
how when you BYBY.

01:14:52.710 --> 01:14:55.920
You have a lower
phenotypic value then

01:14:55.920 --> 01:15:02.220
when you have just
any RM component

01:15:02.220 --> 01:15:04.590
on the right-hand side.

01:15:04.590 --> 01:15:08.680
So those were two
different snips

01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:10.690
on chromosome 7
and chromosome 11

01:15:10.690 --> 01:15:12.915
and showing how they
interact with one another

01:15:12.915 --> 01:15:16.760
in a non-linear way.

01:15:16.760 --> 01:15:21.060
If they were linear, then as you
added either a chromosome at 7

01:15:21.060 --> 01:15:24.560
or a chromosome 11 contribution
it would go up a little bit.

01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:33.410
Here, as soon as you add
either contribution from RM,

01:15:33.410 --> 01:15:38.710
it goes all way up to have
a mean of zero or higher.

01:15:38.710 --> 01:15:44.300
In this particular case, 71%
of the gap between broad-sense

01:15:44.300 --> 01:15:50.360
and narrow-sense was explained
by this one pair interaction.

01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:54.010
So it is the case that
pairwise interactions

01:15:54.010 --> 01:15:56.235
can explain some of the
missing heritability.

01:15:59.540 --> 01:16:01.310
Can anybody think
of anything else

01:16:01.310 --> 01:16:02.893
they can explain
missing heritability?

01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:09.260
OK.

01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:13.967
What's inherited?

01:16:13.967 --> 01:16:15.550
Let's make a list
of everything that's

01:16:15.550 --> 01:16:21.660
inherited from the
parental line to the F1s.

01:16:21.660 --> 01:16:23.450
OK.

01:16:23.450 --> 01:16:24.266
Yes.

01:16:24.266 --> 01:16:27.172
AUDIENCE: I mean,
because there's

01:16:27.172 --> 01:16:29.164
a lot more things inherited.

01:16:29.164 --> 01:16:31.071
The protein levels
are inherited.

01:16:31.071 --> 01:16:31.654
PROFESSOR: OK.

01:16:31.654 --> 01:16:33.734
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
are inherited as well.

01:16:33.734 --> 01:16:34.400
PROFESSOR: Good.

01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:35.909
I like this line of thinking.

01:16:35.909 --> 01:16:36.825
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:16:36.825 --> 01:16:38.325
PROFESSOR: There
are a lot of things

01:16:38.325 --> 01:16:40.130
that are inherited, right?

01:16:40.130 --> 01:16:43.690
So what's inherited?

01:16:43.690 --> 01:16:47.790
Some proteins are
probably inherited, right?

01:16:47.790 --> 01:16:50.760
What is replicable
through generation

01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:54.200
to generation as a genetic
material that's inherited?

01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:56.835
Let's just talk about
that for a moment.

01:16:56.835 --> 01:16:58.710
Proteins are interesting,
don't get me wrong.

01:16:58.710 --> 01:17:01.360
I mean, prions and other
things are very interesting.

01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:03.410
But what else is inherited?

01:17:08.370 --> 01:17:09.137
OK, yes?

01:17:09.137 --> 01:17:10.053
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:17:18.210 --> 01:17:21.230
PROFESSOR: So there are
other genetic molecules.

01:17:21.230 --> 01:17:24.730
Let's just take a really
simple one-- mitochondria.

01:17:24.730 --> 01:17:26.760
OK.

01:17:26.760 --> 01:17:28.830
Mitochondria are inherited.

01:17:28.830 --> 01:17:30.610
And it turns out that
these two strains

01:17:30.610 --> 01:17:35.830
have can have
different mitochondria.

01:17:35.830 --> 01:17:37.120
What else can be inherited?

01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:44.140
Well, we were doing these
experiments with our colleagues

01:17:44.140 --> 01:17:46.822
over at the Whitehead
and for a long time

01:17:46.822 --> 01:17:48.530
we couldn't figure
out what was going on.

01:17:48.530 --> 01:17:50.689
Because we would do the
experiments on day one

01:17:50.689 --> 01:17:52.730
and they come out a
particular way and on day two

01:17:52.730 --> 01:17:54.030
they come out a different way.

01:17:54.030 --> 01:17:55.100
Right.

01:17:55.100 --> 01:17:59.160
And we're doing some very
controlled conditions.

01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:02.460
Until we figured
out that everybody

01:18:02.460 --> 01:18:06.230
uses S288C which is the
genetic nomenclature

01:18:06.230 --> 01:18:10.010
for the lab trained
yeast, right.

01:18:10.010 --> 01:18:12.112
It's lab train because
it's very well behaved.

01:18:12.112 --> 01:18:13.070
It's a very nice yeast.

01:18:13.070 --> 01:18:14.210
It grows very well.

01:18:14.210 --> 01:18:16.220
It's been selected
for that, right.

01:18:16.220 --> 01:18:19.750
And people always do genetic
studies by taking S288C,

01:18:19.750 --> 01:18:22.717
which is the lab yeast, which
has being completely sequenced

01:18:22.717 --> 01:18:24.800
and so you want to use it
because you can download

01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:29.490
the genome with a wild strain.

01:18:29.490 --> 01:18:33.260
And wild strains come
from the wild, right.

01:18:33.260 --> 01:18:35.920
And they come
either off of people

01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:37.230
who have yeast infections.

01:18:37.230 --> 01:18:40.190
I mean, human beings, or
they come off of grape vines

01:18:40.190 --> 01:18:42.120
or God knows where, right.

01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:44.080
But they are not well behaved.

01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:45.760
And why are they
not well behaved?

01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:48.830
What makes these yeast
particularly rude?

01:18:48.830 --> 01:18:51.380
Well, the thing that makes
them particularly rude

01:18:51.380 --> 01:18:54.120
is that they have things
like viruses in them.

01:18:54.120 --> 01:18:55.440
Oh, no.

01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:56.170
OK.

01:18:56.170 --> 01:18:58.470
Because what
happens is that when

01:18:58.470 --> 01:19:01.080
you take a yeast that
has a virus in it,

01:19:01.080 --> 01:19:04.460
and you cross it with
a lab yeast, right.

01:19:04.460 --> 01:19:06.120
All of the kids got the virus.

01:19:08.940 --> 01:19:10.220
Yuck.

01:19:10.220 --> 01:19:11.930
OK.

01:19:11.930 --> 01:19:19.150
And it turns out that the
so-called killer virus in yeast

01:19:19.150 --> 01:19:23.950
interacts with various
chromosomal changes.

01:19:23.950 --> 01:19:25.590
And so now you
have interactions--

01:19:25.590 --> 01:19:29.340
genetic interactions
between a viral element

01:19:29.340 --> 01:19:32.090
and the chromosome.

01:19:32.090 --> 01:19:36.760
And so the phenotype you get
out of particular deletions

01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:41.860
in the yeast genome has
to do with whether or not

01:19:41.860 --> 01:19:44.220
it's infected with
a particular virus.

01:19:44.220 --> 01:19:50.500
It also has to do with which
mitochondrial content it has.

01:19:50.500 --> 01:19:51.970
And people didn't
appreciate this

01:19:51.970 --> 01:19:57.520
until recently because most of
the past yeast studies for QTLs

01:19:57.520 --> 01:20:03.010
were busy crossing lab
strains with wild strains

01:20:03.010 --> 01:20:06.960
and whether it was ethanol
tolerance or growth and heat,

01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:09.620
a lot of the strains
came up with a gene

01:20:09.620 --> 01:20:12.800
as a significant
QTL, which was MKT1.

01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:17.580
And people couldn't understand
why MKT1 was so popular, right.

01:20:17.580 --> 01:20:22.460
MKT1, maintenance
of killer toxin one.

01:20:22.460 --> 01:20:23.050
Yeah.

01:20:23.050 --> 01:20:26.210
That's the viral thing that
enables-- the chromosomal thing

01:20:26.210 --> 01:20:28.130
that enables a viral competence.

01:20:28.130 --> 01:20:34.170
So, it turns out
that if you look

01:20:34.170 --> 01:20:37.440
at this-- in this
particular case,

01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:39.730
we're looking at
yeast that don't

01:20:39.730 --> 01:20:43.220
have the virus in the bottom
little photograph there.

01:20:43.220 --> 01:20:46.595
You can see they're
all sort of, you know,

01:20:46.595 --> 01:20:48.930
they're growing similarly.

01:20:48.930 --> 01:20:53.680
And the yeast with the
same genotype above-- those

01:20:53.680 --> 01:20:56.164
are all in tetrads.

01:20:56.164 --> 01:20:58.080
Two out of the four are
growing, the other two

01:20:58.080 --> 01:21:02.470
are not, because the other two
have a particular deletion.

01:21:02.470 --> 01:21:06.595
And if you look at the
model-- a deletion only model,

01:21:06.595 --> 01:21:09.940
the deletion only, only looks
at the chromosomal compliment

01:21:09.940 --> 01:21:14.660
doesn't predict the
variance very well.

01:21:14.660 --> 01:21:18.150
And if you look at the
deletion and whether or not

01:21:18.150 --> 01:21:21.250
you have the virus,
you do better.

01:21:21.250 --> 01:21:24.190
But you do even
better, if you allow

01:21:24.190 --> 01:21:26.930
for there to be a
nonlinear interaction

01:21:26.930 --> 01:21:29.040
between the chromosomal
modification

01:21:29.040 --> 01:21:31.520
and whether or not
you have a virus.

01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:36.120
And then you recover almost
all of missing heritability.

01:21:36.120 --> 01:21:37.930
So I'll leave you with
this thought, which

01:21:37.930 --> 01:21:45.560
is that genetics is complicated
and QTLs are great, but don't

01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:49.400
forget that there are all
sorts of genetic elements.

01:21:49.400 --> 01:21:50.980
And on that note,
next time we'll

01:21:50.980 --> 01:21:52.490
talk about human genetics.

01:21:52.490 --> 01:21:54.050
Have a great weekend until then.

01:21:54.050 --> 01:21:54.730
We'll see you.

01:21:54.730 --> 01:21:56.440
Take care.
