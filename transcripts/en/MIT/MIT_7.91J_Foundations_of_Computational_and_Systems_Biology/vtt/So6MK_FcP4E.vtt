00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:27.550
PROFESSOR: So you'll
recall last time

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.989
we were working on
protein-protein interactions.

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:32.030
We're going to do a little
bit to finish that up,

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.810
with a topic that will be a
good transition to the study

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.465
of the gene regulatory networks.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.852
And the precise things we're
going to discuss today,

00:00:43.852 --> 00:00:45.810
we're going to start off
with Bayesian networks

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:47.690
of protein-protein
interaction prediction.

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.220
And then we're going to get
into gene expression data,

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:50.170
at several different levels.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:51.753
We'll talk about
some basic questions,

00:00:51.753 --> 00:00:56.120
of how to compare
the two expression

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.462
vectors for a gene,
distance metrics.

00:00:58.462 --> 00:01:00.670
We'll talk about how to
cluster gene expression data.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.250
The idea of
identifying signatures

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.129
of sets of genes, that
might be predictive

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:05.840
of some biological property.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.694
For example, a
susceptibility to a disease.

00:01:08.694 --> 00:01:10.860
And then we'll talk about
a number of different ways

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:11.920
that people have
developed to try

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.596
to identify gene
regulatory networks.

00:01:13.596 --> 00:01:15.220
That often goes by
the name of modules.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.720
I don't particularly
like that name.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.700
But that's what you'll
find in the literature.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.340
And we're going to
focus on a few of these,

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.930
that have recently been
compared head to head, using

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:25.170
both synthetic and real data.

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.660
And we'll see some
of the results

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.920
from that head to
head comparison.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.330
So let's just launch into it.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.160
Remember last time we had
started this unit looking

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.829
at the structural
predictions for proteins.

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:37.620
And we started talking
about how to predict

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:38.900
protein-protein interactions.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.590
Last time we talked about
both computational methods,

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.210
and also experimental
data, that could give us

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.780
information about
protein-protein interactions.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.490
Ostensibly measuring
direct interactions,

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.865
but we saw that there were
possibly very, very high error

00:01:50.865 --> 00:01:51.364
rates.

00:01:51.364 --> 00:01:54.600
So we needed ways of integrating
lots of different kinds of data

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.600
in a probabilistic framework so
we could predict for any pair

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.230
proteins what's the
probability that they interact.

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.160
Not just the fact that
they were detected

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.004
in one assay or the other.

00:02:05.004 --> 00:02:06.920
And we started to talk
about Bayesian networks

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.130
in this context.

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.110
Both useful as we'll see
today, for predicting

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.750
protein-protein
interactions, and also

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.970
for the gene regulatory
network problem.

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.820
So the Bayesian
networks are a tool

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.290
for reasoning probabilistically.

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.680
That's the fundamental purpose.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.040
And we saw that they consisted
of a graph, the network.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.440
And then the probabilities
that represent the probability

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.440
for each edge, the conditional
probability tables.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.289
And that we can learn
these from the data,

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:34.080
either in a completely
objective way, where

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.830
we learn both the structure
and the probability.

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.160
Or where we impose the
structure initially,

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.370
and then we simply learn
the probability tables.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.226
And we had nodes that
represented the variables.

00:02:45.226 --> 00:02:46.600
They could be
hidden nodes, where

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.979
we don't know what the true
answer is, and observed

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:49.770
nodes, where we do.

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.630
So in our case, we're
trying to predict

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.295
protein-protein interactions.

00:02:53.295 --> 00:02:54.670
There's some hidden
variable that

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.380
represents weather protein
A and B truly interact.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:58.970
We don't know that answer.

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.780
But we do know whether
that interaction was

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.090
detected in an experiment
one, two, three or 4.

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.190
Those are the
effects, the observed.

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:06.770
And so we want to
reason backwards

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.355
from the observations,
to the hidden causes.

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.666
So last time we talked about
the high throughput experiments,

00:03:16.666 --> 00:03:18.040
that directly
we're measuring out

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.248
protein-protein interactions.

00:03:19.248 --> 00:03:23.240
We talked about yeast two
hybrid and affinity capture

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.780
mass spec-- here
listed as pull-downs.

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.250
And those could
be used to predict

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.000
protein-protein
directions, by themselves.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
But we want to find out
what other kinds of data

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.010
we can use to amplify
these results, to give us

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.240
independent information about
whether two proteins interact.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.120
And one thing you
could look at is

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.840
whether the expression
of the two genes that you

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.620
think might interact
are similar.

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.130
So if you look over many,
many different conditions,

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.000
you might expect
the two proteins

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.500
that interact with
each other, would

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.957
be expressed under
similar conditions.

00:03:51.957 --> 00:03:53.540
Certainly if you saw
two proteins that

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.550
had exactly opposite
expression patterns,

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:58.862
you would be very unlikely to
believe that they interacted.

00:03:58.862 --> 00:04:01.070
So the question is, how much
is true at the other end

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.850
of the spectrum?

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:04.140
If things are very
highly correlated,

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.200
do they have a high
probability of interaction?

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.970
So this graph is a
histogram for proteins

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.180
that are known to
interact, proteins

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.475
that were shown in these
high throughput experiments

00:04:15.475 --> 00:04:18.815
to interact, and proteins that
are known not to interact,

00:04:18.815 --> 00:04:20.190
of how similar
the expression is.

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:21.731
On the far right
are things that have

00:04:21.731 --> 00:04:25.107
extremely different expression
patterns, a high distance.

00:04:25.107 --> 00:04:26.690
And we'll talk
specifically about what

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:28.127
distance is in just a minute.

00:04:28.127 --> 00:04:30.210
But these are very dissimilar
expression patterns.

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.415
These are very similar ones.

00:04:32.415 --> 00:04:33.790
So what do you
see from this plot

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.340
we looked at the last time?

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:36.930
We saw that the
interacting proteins

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.169
are shifted a bit to the left.

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:41.210
So the interacting ones
have a higher probability

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:42.986
of having similar
expression patterns

00:04:42.986 --> 00:04:44.890
than the ones don't interact.

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:46.530
But we couldn't
draw any cut off,

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.790
and say everything with this
level expression similarity

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:51.150
is guaranteed to interact.

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.617
There's no way to divide these.

00:04:53.617 --> 00:04:55.700
So this will be useful in
a probabilistic setting.

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.600
But by itself, it would
not be highly predictive.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.460
We also talked about
evolutionary patterns,

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.059
and we discussed whether the
red or the green patterns

00:05:04.059 --> 00:05:05.350
here, would be more predictive.

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:06.840
And which one was
it, anyone remember?

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.043
How many people thought the
red was more predictive?

00:05:09.043 --> 00:05:11.390
How many the green?

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:12.410
Right, the greens win.

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.490
And we talked about the
coevolution in other ways.

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.584
So the paper that, I
think, was one of the first

00:05:21.584 --> 00:05:23.250
to do this really
nicely, try to predict

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.330
protein-protein
interaction patterns using

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.160
Bayesian networks, is this
one from Mark Gerstein's lab.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.770
And they start off as we
talked about previously,

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:33.660
we need some gold
standard interactions,

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.150
where we know two proteins
really do interact or don't.

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:40.649
They built their gold
standard data set.

00:05:40.649 --> 00:05:42.190
The positive trending
data, they took

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:44.590
from a database
called MIPS, which

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:47.989
is a hand-curated database
that digs into the literature

00:05:47.989 --> 00:05:50.280
quite deeply, to find out
whether two proteins interact

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:51.400
or not.

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:52.990
And then the negative
data they took

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.100
were proteins that
were identified

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:57.271
as being localized to
different parts of the cell.

00:05:57.271 --> 00:05:58.770
And this was done
in yeast, to where

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:00.860
there is pretty good data
for a lot of proteins,

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.045
to subcellular localization.

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:07.175
So these are the data that
went into their prediction.

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.890
These were the experiments
we've already talked about,

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:14.890
the affinity capture mass
spec and the yeast two hybrid.

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:16.660
And then the other
kinds of data they used

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:19.665
were expression correlation,
one just talked about.

00:06:19.665 --> 00:06:22.860
They also looked at
annotations, whether proteins

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:25.870
had the same annotation
for function.

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:27.460
And essentiality.

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:29.026
So in yeast, it's
pretty easy to go

00:06:29.026 --> 00:06:30.400
through every gene
in the genome,

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.921
knock it out, and determine
whether that kills the cell

00:06:32.921 --> 00:06:33.420
or not.

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:36.050
So they can label
every gene in yeast, as

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:39.625
to whether it's essential
for survival or not.

00:06:39.625 --> 00:06:41.625
And you can see here, the
number of interactions

00:06:41.625 --> 00:06:42.732
that were involved.

00:06:42.732 --> 00:06:44.190
And they decided
to break this down

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:45.773
into two separate
prediction problems.

00:06:45.773 --> 00:06:48.530
So one was an
experimental problem,

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:50.860
using the four
different large scale

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:53.640
data sets in yeast from
protein-protein interactions,

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:55.020
to predict expression.

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:57.450
The other one wore
these other kinds

00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:59.390
of data, that were less direct.

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:01.920
And they used slightly different
kinds of Bayesian networks.

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:05.100
So for this one, they
used a naive Bayes.

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:08.520
And what's the underlying
assumption of the naive Bayes?

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.755
The underlying assumption
is that all the data

00:07:10.755 --> 00:07:11.457
are independent.

00:07:11.457 --> 00:07:12.790
So we looked at this previously.

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:14.960
We discussed how
you could, if you're

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:17.830
trying to identify
the likelihood ratio,

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:19.720
and use it to rank things.

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:23.610
You primarily need to
focus on this term.

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:26.360
Because this term will be the
same for every pair of proteins

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:27.440
that you're examining.

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:28.340
Yes?

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:31.280
AUDIENCE: Could you state
again whether in a naive Bayes,

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.752
all data are dependent
or independent?

00:07:33.752 --> 00:07:34.710
PROFESSOR: Independent.

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:35.251
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:07:38.267 --> 00:07:38.850
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:41.060
So let's actually look
at some of their data.

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:44.780
So in this table, they're
looking at the likelihood ratio

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:47.050
that two proteins
interact, based

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:49.280
on whether the two
proteins are essential.

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:51.400
One is essential, and
one is a nonessential.

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:53.290
Both are nonessential.

00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:56.610
So that's what these
two codes here mean.

00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:57.770
EE, both essential.

00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:01.615
NN, both nonessential,
and any one and the other.

00:08:01.615 --> 00:08:03.490
And so they've computed
for all those protein

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:06.060
pairs, how many in
their gold standard,

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:08.660
are EE, how many are
EN, how many are NN?

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:15.100
So here are the
numbers for the EE.

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:20.090
There are just over 1,000, out
of the 2,000, roughly 2,000

00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:20.775
that are EE.

00:08:20.775 --> 00:08:23.700
So that comes up with a
probability of being essential,

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:25.440
given that I know
that you're positive.

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:28.700
You're in the gold standard
of roughly 50%, right?

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:32.742
And you can assume something
similar for the negatives.

00:08:32.742 --> 00:08:34.950
So these are the ones that
definitely don't interact.

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:36.820
So the probability of
both being essential,

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:41.520
given that it's negative,
is about 15%, 14%.

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:46.340
And so then the likelihood ratio
comes out to just under four.

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:49.200
So there's a fourfold
increase in probability

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:52.700
that something is interacting,
given that it's essential,

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:55.840
then not.

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:57.812
And this is the table
for all of the terms,

00:08:57.812 --> 00:09:00.270
for all of the different things
that they were considering,

00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:01.644
that were not
direct experiments.

00:09:01.644 --> 00:09:03.170
So this is the sensuality.

00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:05.950
This is expression correlation,
with various values

00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:10.590
for the threshold, how similar
the expression had to be.

00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:15.412
And these are the terms from
the databases for annotation.

00:09:15.412 --> 00:09:16.870
And then for each
of these, then we

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:19.119
get a likelihood ratio
of how predictive it is.

00:09:19.119 --> 00:09:21.660
So it's kind of informative to
look at some of these numbers.

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:23.530
We already saw that
essentiality is

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:26.350
pretty weak, predicted the fact
that two genes are essential.

00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:28.530
It only gives you a
slightly increased chance

00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:30.120
that they're
interacting than not.

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:32.971
But if two things, two genes
have extremely high expression

00:09:32.971 --> 00:09:35.220
correlation, then they're
more than a hundredfold more

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:38.280
likely to interact than not.

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:41.270
And the numbers
for the annotations

00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:43.275
are significantly
less than that.

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:47.016
So this is a naive Bayes.

00:09:47.016 --> 00:09:49.390
We're going to multiply all
those probabilities together.

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:52.720
Now for the
experimental data, they

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.970
said, well, these are
probably not all independent.

00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:57.053
The probably that you pick
something up in one two

00:09:57.053 --> 00:09:59.216
hybrid experiment,
is probably highly

00:09:59.216 --> 00:10:01.340
correlated with the
probability that you pick it up

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:03.330
in another two
hybrid experiment.

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:05.990
And one would hope that there's
some correlation between things

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:09.090
are identifying in two hybrid
and affinity caption mass spec.

00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:12.330
Although we'll see whether
or not that's the case.

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:14.950
So they used what they refer
to as a fully connected Bayes.

00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:16.540
And what do we mean by that?

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:18.257
Remember, this was
the naive Bayes,

00:10:18.257 --> 00:10:19.590
where everything is independent.

00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:21.173
So the probability
of some observation

00:10:21.173 --> 00:10:23.984
is the product of all the
individual probabilities.

00:10:23.984 --> 00:10:25.400
But in a fully
connected Bayes, we

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.030
don't have that
independence assumption.

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:30.940
So you need to actually
explicitly compute

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:32.850
what the probability
is for an interaction,

00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:36.139
based on all the possible
outcomes in those experiments.

00:10:36.139 --> 00:10:37.430
So that's not that much harder.

00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:42.630
We simply have a table now,
where these columns represent

00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:45.150
each of the experimental
data types--

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:49.610
the affinity capture mass
spec and the two hybrids.

00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:51.240
Ones indicate that
it was detected,

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:52.390
Zero is that it's not.

00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:54.840
And then we simply look
again in our gold standard,

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:59.490
and see how often a protein that
had been detected in whatever

00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:03.470
the setting is here, in all
of them except Ito, how often

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:05.700
was it, how many of the
gold positives do we get?

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:06.790
And how many of
the gold negatives?

00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:08.539
And then we can compute
the probabilities.

00:11:11.284 --> 00:11:12.700
Now it's important
to look at some

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:14.449
of the numbers in these
tables and dig in.

00:11:14.449 --> 00:11:17.450
Because you'll see the numbers
here are really, really small.

00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:19.770
So they have to be
interpreted with caution.

00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:22.380
So some of the
things that might not

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:23.870
hold up with much
larger data sets.

00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:26.036
You might imagine the things
that are experimentally

00:11:26.036 --> 00:11:27.920
detected in all of the
high-throughput assays

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:30.250
would be the most confident.

00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:32.120
That doesn't turn
out to be the case.

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:36.260
So these are sorted by the
law of likelihood ratio,

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.300
and the best one is not 1, 1, 1.

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:40.160
It's up there.

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:41.700
But it's not the
top of the pack.

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:44.110
And that's probably just the
statistics of small numbers.

00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:46.920
If the databases were larger,
experiments were larger,

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:49.440
it probably would
work out that way.

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:52.530
So any question about how
they formulated this problem,

00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:54.835
as a Bayesian network, or
how they implemented it?

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:01.680
OK.

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:05.480
So the results then-- so once
we have these likelihood ratios,

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:10.050
we can try to choose a threshold
for deciding what we're

00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:12.410
going to consider to be a
true interaction and not.

00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:15.040
So here they've plotted for
different likelihood ratio

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:16.880
thresholds.

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:20.310
On the x-axis, how many of the
true positives you get right,

00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:21.620
versus how many you get wrong.

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:27.030
So the true positive
over the false positive.

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:29.190
And you can
arbitrarily decide, OK,

00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:31.930
well I want to be more-- I want
to get more right than wrong.

00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:34.960
Not a bad way to decide things.

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:37.290
So your passing
grade here is 50%.

00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:39.600
So if I draw a line,
a horizontal line,

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:41.760
and wanted to get
more right than wrong,

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:45.600
you'll see that any
of the individual

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:49.880
signals that they were
using, essentiality,

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:53.390
database sanitation, and so on--
all of those fall below that.

00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:57.320
So individually, they predict
more wrongs than rights.

00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:00.720
But if you combine the data
using this Bayesian network,

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:02.850
then you can choose a
likelihood threshold,

00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:05.740
where you do get more
right than wrong.

00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:08.560
And you can set your
threshold wherever you want.

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:11.670
Similarly for the direct
experimental data,

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:15.560
you do better by combining--
these are light pink lines,

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:18.930
than you would with any of
the individual data sets.

00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:21.350
So this shows the utility
of combining the data,

00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:25.360
and reasoning from the
data probabilistically.

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:28.200
Any questions?

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:29.700
So we'll return to
Bayesian networks

00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:34.340
in a bit in the
context of discovering

00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:35.990
gene regulatory networks.

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:39.010
So we now want to move
to gene expression data.

00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:42.210
And the primary reason to be so
interested in gene expression

00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:44.690
data is simply that there's a
huge amount of it out there.

00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:47.820
So just a short time ago
we passed the million mark,

00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:49.550
with a number of
expression data sets

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:52.260
that had been collected
in the databases.

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.760
There's much less of any other
kind of high throughput data.

00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:58.012
So if you look at proteomics
or high-throughput genetic

00:13:58.012 --> 00:13:59.720
screens, there are
tiny numbers, compared

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:01.030
to gene expression data.

00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:04.209
So obviously techniques for
analyzing gene expression data

00:14:04.209 --> 00:14:06.500
are going to play a very
important role for a long time

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:07.100
to come.

00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:11.730
Some of what I'm
going to discuss today

00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:12.938
is covered in your textbooks.

00:14:12.938 --> 00:14:17.072
I encourage you to look
at text section 16.2.

00:14:17.072 --> 00:14:19.280
The fundamental thing that
we're interested in doing,

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:22.180
is seeing how much
biological knowledge

00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:25.152
we can infer from the
gene expression data.

00:14:25.152 --> 00:14:26.610
So we might imagine
that genes that

00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:28.940
are coexpressed under
particular sets and conditions,

00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:30.790
have functional
similarity, reflect

00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:33.050
common regulatory mechanisms,
and our goal then,

00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:34.900
is to discover those mechanisms.

00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:37.730
So fundamental to this then, any
time we have a pair of genes--

00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:39.521
and we look at their
gene expression data--

00:14:39.521 --> 00:14:41.710
we want to decide
how similar they are.

00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:45.540
So let's imagine that we had
these data for four genes.

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:47.332
And it's a time
series experiment.

00:14:47.332 --> 00:14:49.540
And we're looking at the
different expression levels.

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:51.270
And we want some
quantitative measure

00:14:51.270 --> 00:14:54.580
to decide which two
genes are most similar.

00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:56.250
Well, it turns out
it's a lot more

00:14:56.250 --> 00:14:57.389
subtle than we might think.

00:14:57.389 --> 00:14:59.180
So at first glance,
oh, it's pretty obvious

00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:00.750
that these two are
the most similar.

00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:02.870
But it really depends on
what kind of similarity

00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:04.460
you're asking about.

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:07.930
So we can describe
any expression data

00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:13.930
set for any gene, is simply
a multi-dimensional vector.

00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:16.300
Where this is the set
of expression values

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:18.670
we detected for the
first gene, across all

00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:20.670
the different experimental
conditions and so on,

00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:21.650
for the second.

00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:23.730
And what would be the
most intuitive way

00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:26.410
of describing the
distance between two

00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:27.640
multi-dimensional vectors?

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:30.000
It would simply be
Euclidean distance, right?

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.840
So that's perfectly reasonable.

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:34.660
So we can decide that the
distance between two gene

00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:37.850
expression data sets, is
simply the square root

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:40.030
of the sum of the
squares of the distances.

00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:45.075
So we'll take the sum over all
the experimental conditions

00:15:45.075 --> 00:15:45.950
that we've looked at.

00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:47.170
Maybe it's a time series.

00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:49.080
Maybe it's different
perturbations.

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:52.720
And look at the difference in
expression of gene A and gene

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:56.860
B in that condition, K.
And then evaluating this

00:15:56.860 --> 00:16:00.500
will tell us how similar two
genes are in their expression

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:02.680
profiles.

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:04.970
Well, that's a specific
example of a distance metric.

00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:06.845
It turns out that there's
a formal definition

00:16:06.845 --> 00:16:08.480
for a distance metric.

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:10.430
Distances have the
following properties.

00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:12.150
They're always
greater than zero.

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:14.180
We never have
negative distances.

00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:18.180
They are equal to zero under
exactly one condition-- the two

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:20.080
data points are the same.

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:21.500
And they're symmetric.

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:23.430
So the distance from
A to B is the same

00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:26.240
as the distance from B to A.

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:28.810
Now, to be a true
distance, then you also

00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:30.930
have to satisfy the
triangle inequality,

00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:34.380
that the distance from
x to z is less than

00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:35.880
or equal to the sum
of the distances

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:37.479
through a third point.

00:16:37.479 --> 00:16:39.270
But we will find out
that we don't actually

00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:40.820
need that for
similarity measures.

00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:42.900
So we can have either
a true distance

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:45.110
metric for comparing gene
expression data sets,

00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:48.540
or similarity measures as well.

00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:50.510
So let's go back to
the simple example.

00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:52.900
So we decided that the
red and the blue genes

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:55.580
were nearly identical, in terms
of their distance metrics.

00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:57.720
But that's not always
exactly what we care about.

00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:00.170
So in biological settings,
frequently the absolute level

00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:03.780
of gene expression is
on some arbitrary scale.

00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:05.304
Certainly with
expression arrays,

00:17:05.304 --> 00:17:06.470
it was completely arbitrary.

00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:08.230
It had to do with
fluorescence properties,

00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:10.819
and how well probes
hybridize to each other.

00:17:10.819 --> 00:17:12.670
But even with mRNA,
how do we really

00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:15.300
know that 1,000 copies
is fundamentally

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:18.510
different from 1,200 copies
of an RNA in the cell?

00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:19.650
We don't.

00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:23.339
So we might be more interested
in distance metrics that

00:17:23.339 --> 00:17:25.790
capture not just the
similarity of these two.

00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:28.140
But the fact that these
two are also quite similar,

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:34.930
in terms of the trajectory
of the plot to this one.

00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:37.660
So can we come up with measures
that capture this one as well?

00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:40.800
A very common one for this
is Pearson correlation.

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:43.199
So in Pearson correlation,
we're gonna look at not just

00:17:43.199 --> 00:17:44.990
the expression of a
gene across conditions.

00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:47.590
But we're gonna look at
the z-score of that gene.

00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:50.955
So we'll take all
of the data for all

00:17:50.955 --> 00:17:53.370
of the genes in a
particular condition.

00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:55.270
And we'll compute the
z-score by looking

00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:59.310
at the difference
between the expression

00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:01.600
of a particular gene, in
the average expression

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:03.100
across the whole data set.

00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:04.780
And we're going to normalize
it by the standard deviation.

00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:05.280
Yes?

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:07.282
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
square there?

00:18:07.282 --> 00:18:08.490
PROFESSOR: Yes, you're right.

00:18:08.490 --> 00:18:09.510
There should be a square there.

00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:10.010
Thank you.

00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:16.100
So then to compute the
Pearson correlation,

00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:18.630
we're going between
two genes, A and B,

00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:20.890
we're going to take the
sum over all experiments,

00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:23.920
that the z-score for A
and the z-score for B,

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:27.998
the product of that, summed
over all the experiments.

00:18:27.998 --> 00:18:29.747
And these values as
we'll see in a second,

00:18:29.747 --> 00:18:31.555
are going to range
from plus 1, which

00:18:31.555 --> 00:18:34.030
would be a perfect
correlation, to minus 1,

00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:37.150
which would be a perfect
anti-correlation.

00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:40.610
And then we're going to find the
distance is 1 minus this value.

00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:42.810
So things that are
perfectly correlated then,

00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:44.792
would have an r of zero.

00:18:44.792 --> 00:18:46.250
And things that
are anti-correlated

00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:48.250
would have a large one.

00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:49.626
So if we take a
look at these two

00:18:49.626 --> 00:18:51.250
obviously by Euclidean
distance, they'd

00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:52.740
be quite different
from each other.

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:55.140
But the z-scores have
converted the expression values

00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:57.280
into z-scores over
here, you can see

00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:58.890
that the z-scores
obviously, this one

00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:01.110
is the most negative
of all of the ones.

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:03.102
And this as the lowest
one in all of these.

00:19:03.102 --> 00:19:04.060
This one's the highest.

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:06.340
And similarly for the red
one, lowest to the highest.

00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:08.350
So the z-scores track very well.

00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:09.850
And when I take the
product of this,

00:19:09.850 --> 00:19:13.280
the signs of the z-score for
A and B are always the same.

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:16.439
So I summed the product of the
z-scores, I get a large number.

00:19:16.439 --> 00:19:17.980
And then the
normalization guarantees

00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:20.570
that it comes out to one.

00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:23.000
And so the red
and blue here will

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.720
have a very high
correlation coefficient.

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:27.590
In this case, it's going
to be an r correlation

00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:28.850
coefficient of 1.

00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:33.220
Whereas compared to this one,
which is relatively flat,

00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:36.280
the correlation coefficient
will be approximately zero.

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:37.245
Any questions on that?

00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:46.157
So what about, say
the blue and the red?

00:19:46.157 --> 00:19:47.740
Well, their z-scores
are going to have

00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:50.480
almost the opposite
sign every single time.

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:53.370
And so that's going to add
up to a large negative value.

00:19:53.370 --> 00:19:55.370
So for these, they'll be
highly anti-correlated.

00:19:55.370 --> 00:20:00.220
So A, the blue and the red,
have a correlation coefficient

00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:01.940
of minus 1.

00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:02.440
OK.

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:03.898
So we have these
two different ways

00:20:03.898 --> 00:20:06.080
of computing distance measures.

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:08.600
We can compute the
Euclidean distance,

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:11.270
which would make the
red and blue the same,

00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:13.656
but treat the green one as
being completely different.

00:20:13.656 --> 00:20:15.030
Or we have the
correlation, which

00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:17.579
would group all of these
together, as being similar.

00:20:17.579 --> 00:20:19.870
What you want to do is going
to depend on your setting.

00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:21.369
If you look in your
textbook, you'll

00:20:21.369 --> 00:20:25.015
see a lot of other definitions
of distance as well.

00:20:25.015 --> 00:20:27.140
Now what if you're missing
a particular data point?

00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:29.930
This used to be a lot more
of a problem with arrays

00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:33.430
than it is with [? RNAC. ?]
With arrays, you'd often

00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:36.300
have dirt on the array, that
it actually would literally

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:38.890
cover up spots.

00:20:38.890 --> 00:20:40.660
But you have a bunch of choices.

00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:42.570
The most extreme would
just be to ignore

00:20:42.570 --> 00:20:46.660
that row or column of your
matrix across old data sets.

00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:48.580
That's usually not
what we want to do.

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:50.920
You could put in some
arbitrary small value.

00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:54.450
But frequently we will do what's
called imputing, where we'll

00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:57.340
try to identify the
genes that have the most

00:20:57.340 --> 00:20:59.740
similar expression, and replace
the value for the missing

00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:02.270
one with a value from
the ones that we do know.

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:08.140
Distance metrics,
pretty straightforward.

00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:09.910
Now we want to
use these distance

00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:12.659
metrics to actually
cluster the data.

00:21:12.659 --> 00:21:13.700
And what's the idea here?

00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:16.340
That if we look across
enough data sets,

00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:19.660
we might find certain groups of
genes that function similarly

00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:21.640
across all those
data sets, that might

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:24.674
be revealing as to their
biological function.

00:21:24.674 --> 00:21:27.090
So this is an example of an
unsupervised learning problem.

00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:29.527
We don't know what the
classes are, before we go in.

00:21:29.527 --> 00:21:31.110
We don't even know
how many there are.

00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:32.840
We want to learn from the data.

00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:35.260
This is a very large
area of machine learning.

00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:37.612
We're just gonna
scrape the surface.

00:21:37.612 --> 00:21:39.320
Some of you may be
familiar with the fact

00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:40.730
that these kinds of
machine learning algorithms

00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:42.660
are used widely
outside of biology.

00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:45.000
They're used by
Netflix to tell you

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.410
what would movie to choose next.

00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:48.430
Or Amazon, to try to
sell you new products.

00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:54.630
And all the advertisers who send
pop-up ads on your computer.

00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:56.240
But in our biological
setting then, we

00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:59.030
have our gene expression
data, collected possibly

00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:00.632
over very large
numbers of conditions.

00:22:00.632 --> 00:22:02.090
And we want to find
groups of genes

00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:04.850
that have some similarity.

00:22:04.850 --> 00:22:07.720
This is a figure from one of
these very early papers, that

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:10.260
sort of establish how
people present these datas.

00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:13.020
So you'll almost always see
the same kind of presentation.

00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:16.940
Typically you'll get a heat
map, where genes are rows.

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:18.790
And the different
experiments here time,

00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:22.629
but it could be different
perturbations, are the columns.

00:22:22.629 --> 00:22:24.420
And genes that go up
in expression are red,

00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:26.517
and genes ago down in
expression are green.

00:22:26.517 --> 00:22:29.520
And apologies to anyone
who's colorblind.

00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:33.560
But that's just what the
convention has become.

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:35.280
OK, so then why cluster?

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:38.010
So if we cluster
across the rows, then

00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:40.397
we'll get sets of genes
that potentially behave--

00:22:40.397 --> 00:22:41.980
that hopefully if
we do this properly,

00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:44.320
behave similarly across
different subsets

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:46.630
of the experiments.

00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:48.960
And those might represent
similar functions.

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:51.040
And if we cluster
the columns, then we

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:54.245
get different experiments
that show similar responses.

00:22:54.245 --> 00:22:56.370
So that might be in this
case, different times that

00:22:56.370 --> 00:22:56.870
are similar.

00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:59.210
Hopefully those are ones
that are close to each other.

00:22:59.210 --> 00:23:00.760
But if we have lots
of different patients,

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:02.260
as we'll see in a
second, they might

00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:06.670
represent patients who have a
similar version of a disease.

00:23:06.670 --> 00:23:09.680
And in fact, the clustering
of genes does work.

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:11.400
So even in this
very early paper,

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:15.345
they were able to identify a
bunch of subsets of genes that

00:23:15.345 --> 00:23:17.470
showed similar expression
at different time points,

00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:19.720
and turned out to be enriched
in different categories.

00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:22.640
These ones were enriched in
cholesterol biosynthesis,

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:26.570
whereas these were enriched
in wound healing, and so on.

00:23:26.570 --> 00:23:28.990
So how do you actually
do clustering?

00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:31.160
This kind of clustering
is called hierarchical.

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:32.410
That's pretty straightforward.

00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:35.590
There are two versions of
hierarchical clustering.

00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:39.744
There's what's called
agglomerative and divisive.

00:23:39.744 --> 00:23:41.910
In agglomerative, you start
off with each data point

00:23:41.910 --> 00:23:42.900
in its own cluster.

00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:46.610
And then you search for the
most similar data point to it,

00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:47.890
and you group those together.

00:23:47.890 --> 00:23:49.389
And you keep doing
that iteratively,

00:23:49.389 --> 00:23:53.430
building up larger
and larger clusters.

00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:57.970
So we've discussed how to
compare our individual genes.

00:23:57.970 --> 00:23:59.570
But you should be
able to, right now,

00:23:59.570 --> 00:24:01.860
to find, if I gave you
the vector of expression

00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:04.310
for a single gene, to find
the other genes in the data

00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:06.810
set that's most similar,
by either say, Euclidean

00:24:06.810 --> 00:24:09.650
or Pearson correlation,
or what have you.

00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:12.440
But once you've grouped
two genes together,

00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:14.330
how do you decide
whether a third gene is

00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:16.170
similar to those two?

00:24:16.170 --> 00:24:17.670
So now we have to
make some choices.

00:24:17.670 --> 00:24:19.503
And so there are number
of different choices

00:24:19.503 --> 00:24:21.480
that are commonly made.

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:23.010
So let's say these are our data.

00:24:23.010 --> 00:24:27.600
We've got these two
clusters, Y and Z.

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:30.260
And each circle represents a
data point in those clusters.

00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:31.940
So we've got four
genes in each cluster.

00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:34.090
Now we want to decide
on a distance measure

00:24:34.090 --> 00:24:38.509
to compare cluster Y to
cluster Z. So what could we do?

00:24:38.509 --> 00:24:39.800
So what are some possibilities?

00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:40.550
What might you do?

00:24:45.370 --> 00:24:47.780
AUDIENCE: We could take
the average of all points.

00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:50.238
PROFESSOR: You could take the
average of all points, right.

00:24:50.238 --> 00:24:51.820
What else could you do?

00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:54.310
Only a limited number
of possibilities.

00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:55.265
AUDIENCE: Centroid?

00:24:55.265 --> 00:24:56.640
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
so centroid, you

00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:58.280
could take some sort
of average, right.

00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:00.070
Any other possibilities?

00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:01.695
AUDIENCE: You can
pick a representative

00:25:01.695 --> 00:25:03.932
from each set [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:03.932 --> 00:25:06.140
PROFESSOR: So you could pick
a representative, right?

00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:08.580
How would you decide in advance
what that would be though?

00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:10.875
So maybe you have
a way, maybe not.

00:25:10.875 --> 00:25:13.991
And what other
possibilities are there?

00:25:13.991 --> 00:25:14.490
Yeah?

00:25:14.490 --> 00:25:16.865
AUDIENCE: Measure all
the distances [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:16.865 --> 00:25:18.282
to all the nodes in the other.

00:25:18.282 --> 00:25:18.990
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:25:18.990 --> 00:25:20.250
So you could do all to all.

00:25:20.250 --> 00:25:21.208
What else could you do?

00:25:23.445 --> 00:25:25.320
You can take the minimum
of all those values.

00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:26.930
You can take the maximum
of all those values.

00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:29.221
And we'll see that all those
are things that people do.

00:25:29.221 --> 00:25:32.910
So this clustering,
there are already

00:25:32.910 --> 00:25:36.560
rather uninformative
terms for some

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:37.760
of these kinds of decisions.

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:39.500
So it's called
single linkage, is

00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:42.260
you decide that the distance
between two clusters

00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:45.370
is based on the minimum distance
between any member of cluster Y

00:25:45.370 --> 00:25:48.950
and any member of cluster Z.

00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:54.480
Complete linkage takes
the maximum distance.

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:56.780
And then the extremely
unfortunately named

00:25:56.780 --> 00:26:02.260
Unweighted Pair Group Method
using Centroids-- UPGMC,

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:04.040
I won't try to say
that very often-- takes

00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:09.820
the centroid, which was an
early suggestion from the class.

00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:14.740
And then the UPGMA,
Unweighted Pair Group Method

00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:16.869
with Arithmetic Mean,
takes the average

00:26:16.869 --> 00:26:18.410
of all the distances,
all suggestions

00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:19.740
that people have made.

00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:21.532
So when would you use
one versus the other?

00:26:21.532 --> 00:26:23.323
Well, a priori, you
don't necessarily know.

00:26:23.323 --> 00:26:25.210
But it's good to know
how they'll behave.

00:26:25.210 --> 00:26:26.940
So what do you imagine
is going to happen

00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:31.250
if you use single linkage,
versus complete linkage.

00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:33.690
Remember, single linkage
is the minimum distance.

00:26:33.690 --> 00:26:35.720
And complete linkage is
the maximum distance.

00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:36.710
So what's going to
happen in this case,

00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:37.990
if I use the minimum distance.

00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:39.323
Which two groups will I combine?

00:26:43.269 --> 00:26:44.560
AUDIENCE: The blue and the red.

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:46.185
PROFESSOR: The blue
and the red, right?

00:26:46.185 --> 00:26:48.420
Whereas if I use the
maximum distance,

00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:50.260
then I'll combine the
green and the red.

00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:52.420
So it's important
to recognize, then,

00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:57.590
that the single linkage has this
property of chaining together

00:26:57.590 --> 00:27:00.410
clusters, based on points
that are near each other.

00:27:00.410 --> 00:27:04.880
Whereas the complete linkage
is resistant to grouping things

00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:06.300
together, if they have outliers.

00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:07.550
So they'll behave differently.

00:27:07.550 --> 00:27:09.790
Now, if your data are
compact, and you really

00:27:09.790 --> 00:27:11.810
do have tight clusters,
it's not going

00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:13.355
to matter too much
would you use.

00:27:13.355 --> 00:27:15.980
But in most biological settings,
we're dealing with much noise,

00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:16.721
there's data.

00:27:16.721 --> 00:27:18.470
So you actually will
get different results

00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:19.342
based on this.

00:27:19.342 --> 00:27:21.550
And as far as I know, there's
no really principal way

00:27:21.550 --> 00:27:26.090
to figure out if you have no
prior knowledge, which to use.

00:27:26.090 --> 00:27:28.570
Now all of these
hierarchical clustering

00:27:28.570 --> 00:27:30.910
come with what's
called a dendogram.

00:27:30.910 --> 00:27:34.280
And you'll see these at the
top of all the clustering.

00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:36.060
And this represents
the process by which

00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:37.400
the data were clustered.

00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:39.606
So the things that
are most similar

00:27:39.606 --> 00:27:41.480
are most tightly connected
in this dendogram.

00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:44.210
So these two data
points, one and two, you

00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:49.620
have to go up very little in the
y-axis, to get from one to two.

00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:52.180
Whereas if you want
to go from one to 16,

00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:55.080
you have to traverse
the entire dendogram.

00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:56.780
So the distance
between two samples

00:27:56.780 --> 00:28:00.680
is how far vertically you have
to go to connect between them.

00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:04.370
Now the good things
are that the dendogram

00:28:04.370 --> 00:28:07.350
is, you can then understand
the clustering of the data.

00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:09.860
So I can cut this dendogram
at any particular distance,

00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:13.230
and get clearly divisions
among my data sets.

00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:15.950
So if I cut here at
this distance level,

00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:16.920
then I have two groups.

00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:18.755
One small, one
consisting of these data.

00:28:18.755 --> 00:28:20.820
And one large, one
consisting of these.

00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:23.880
Whereas if I cut down here, I
have more groups of my data.

00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:26.490
So it doesn't require me in
advance to know how many groups

00:28:26.490 --> 00:28:26.990
I have.

00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:29.940
I can look at the
dendogram and infer it.

00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:32.730
The one risk is that you
always get a dendogram that's

00:28:32.730 --> 00:28:35.510
hierarchical, regardless of
if the data were hierarchical

00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:36.310
or not.

00:28:36.310 --> 00:28:38.650
So it's more a reflection of
how you did your clustering

00:28:38.650 --> 00:28:41.180
than any fundamental
structure of the data.

00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:45.294
So the fact that you get
a hierarchical dendogram

00:28:45.294 --> 00:28:46.835
means really nothing
about your data.

00:28:46.835 --> 00:28:48.293
It's simply a tool
that you can use

00:28:48.293 --> 00:28:52.450
to try to divide it up
into different groups.

00:28:52.450 --> 00:28:55.180
Any questions on the
hierarchical clustering?

00:28:58.717 --> 00:28:59.217
Yes?

00:29:01.993 --> 00:29:03.993
AUDIENCE: If each data
point is its own cluster,

00:29:03.993 --> 00:29:09.482
then won't that be consistent
across, like, single linkage,

00:29:09.482 --> 00:29:12.490
complete linkage-- like,
why would you cluster?

00:29:12.490 --> 00:29:13.966
Does that question make sense?

00:29:13.966 --> 00:29:20.854
Like if you cut it down below,
then haven't you minimized--

00:29:20.854 --> 00:29:24.790
don't you successively
minimize the variance, I guess,

00:29:24.790 --> 00:29:27.394
up to your clusters, by--

00:29:27.394 --> 00:29:29.310
PROFESSOR: So if I cut
it at the lowest level,

00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:30.601
everybody is their own cluster.

00:29:30.601 --> 00:29:31.720
That's true.

00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:32.220
Right.

00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:34.011
I'm interested in
finding out whether there

00:29:34.011 --> 00:29:36.330
are genes that behave
similarly across the data sets.

00:29:36.330 --> 00:29:36.585
Or--

00:29:36.585 --> 00:29:37.708
AUDIENCE: My question
is, how would you

00:29:37.708 --> 00:29:39.880
go about determining how
many clusters your want?

00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:40.160
PROFESSOR: Oh, OK.

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:41.576
So we'll come to
that in a second.

00:29:41.576 --> 00:29:43.730
So hierarchical clustering,
you don't actually

00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:45.869
have any objective
way of doing that.

00:29:45.869 --> 00:29:47.660
But we'll talk about
other means right now,

00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:49.000
where it's a little bit clearer.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.880
But actually
fundamentally, there

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:53.220
aren't a lot of good ways
of knowing a priori what

00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:54.840
the right number of clusters is.

00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:57.090
But we'll look at some
measures in a second that help.

00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:03.270
So hierarchical clustering,
as your question implies,

00:30:03.270 --> 00:30:06.520
doesn't really tell you how
many clusters there are.

00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:08.250
Another approach is
to decide in advance

00:30:08.250 --> 00:30:10.000
how many clusters you expect.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.250
And then see whether you can
get the data of the group

00:30:12.250 --> 00:30:13.862
into that number or not.

00:30:13.862 --> 00:30:15.320
And an example of
that is something

00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:16.900
called k-means clustering.

00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:18.324
So the nice thing
about it, is it

00:30:18.324 --> 00:30:19.740
does give you the
sharp divisions.

00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:21.760
But again if you
chose k incorrectly,

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:23.430
we'll see in a
second, you will get--

00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:25.710
you'll never less
still get K-clusters.

00:30:25.710 --> 00:30:28.330
So K refers the
number of clusters

00:30:28.330 --> 00:30:30.950
that you tell the algorithm
you expect to get.

00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:33.340
So you specify that in advance.

00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:35.500
And then you try to
find a set of clusters

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:37.790
that minimizes the distance.

00:30:37.790 --> 00:30:40.540
So everybody's assigned
to a particular cluster,

00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:43.410
and the center of that cluster.

00:30:43.410 --> 00:30:44.000
Is that clear?

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.959
So that's what these
equations represent.

00:30:45.959 --> 00:30:47.750
So the center of the
cluster, the centroid,

00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:50.910
is just the average coordinates,
over all the components

00:30:50.910 --> 00:30:52.180
of that cluster.

00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:55.390
And we're trying to find
this set of clusters, C,

00:30:55.390 --> 00:31:00.110
that minimizes the sum of
the square of the distances

00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:04.010
between each member of that
cluster and the centroid.

00:31:04.010 --> 00:31:07.720
Any questions on how
we're doing this?

00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:10.160
OK.

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:10.660
All right.

00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:11.530
So what's the actual algorithm?

00:31:11.530 --> 00:31:12.680
That's remarkably simple.

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:16.470
I'm choosing that initial
set of random positions.

00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:21.680
And then I have the simple loop,
I repeat until convergence.

00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:25.850
For every point, I assign
it to the nearest centroid.

00:31:25.850 --> 00:31:29.967
So if my starting
centroids would be circles,

00:31:29.967 --> 00:31:31.550
I look at every data
point, and I ask,

00:31:31.550 --> 00:31:33.049
how close is it to
any one of these?

00:31:33.049 --> 00:31:35.660
That's what the boundaries
are, defined by these lines.

00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:39.374
So everything above this
line belongs to the centroid.

00:31:39.374 --> 00:31:41.290
Everything over here
belongs to this centroid.

00:31:41.290 --> 00:31:44.850
So I divide the data up by which
centroid you are closest to.

00:31:44.850 --> 00:31:47.110
And I assign you
to that centroid.

00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:48.960
That's step one.

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:51.371
And step two, I
compute new centroids.

00:31:51.371 --> 00:31:53.120
And that's what these
triangles represent.

00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:54.522
So after I did
that partitioning,

00:31:54.522 --> 00:31:56.230
it turns out that most
of the things that

00:31:56.230 --> 00:32:00.540
were assigned to the triangular
cluster live over here.

00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:03.790
So the centroid moves
from being here to here.

00:32:03.790 --> 00:32:06.360
And I iterate this process.

00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:09.410
That's the entire K-means
clustering algorithm.

00:32:09.410 --> 00:32:12.670
So here's an example
where I generated data

00:32:12.670 --> 00:32:15.210
from three [? calcines. ?]
I chose initial data

00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:18.580
points, which are the circles.

00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:19.830
I follow that protocol.

00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:21.010
Here's the first step.

00:32:21.010 --> 00:32:22.320
It computes new triangles.

00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:25.100
Second step, and
then it converges.

00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:26.700
The distance stops changing.

00:32:30.841 --> 00:32:32.340
Now this question's
already come up.

00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:35.200
So what happens if you
choose the wrong K?

00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:37.269
So I believe there
are three clusters.

00:32:37.269 --> 00:32:38.560
And really that's not the case.

00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:39.971
So what's going to happen?

00:32:39.971 --> 00:32:41.595
So in this data set,
there really were.

00:32:41.595 --> 00:32:45.710
How many, there really
were five clusters.

00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:47.360
Here, they're
clustered correctly.

00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:49.160
What if I told the
algorithm to do

00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:51.826
K-means clustering
with a K of three?

00:32:51.826 --> 00:32:54.200
It would still find a way to
come up with three clusters.

00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:56.677
So now it's grouped these
two things, which are clearly

00:32:56.677 --> 00:32:59.010
generated from different
[? calcines ?] scenes together.

00:32:59.010 --> 00:33:00.843
It's grouped these two,
which were generated

00:33:00.843 --> 00:33:02.970
from different [? calcines ?]
together, and so on.

00:33:02.970 --> 00:33:03.470
All right.

00:33:03.470 --> 00:33:05.270
So K-means clustering
will do what

00:33:05.270 --> 00:33:07.330
you tell it to do, regardless of
whether that's the right answer

00:33:07.330 --> 00:33:07.970
or not.

00:33:07.970 --> 00:33:10.110
And if you tell it there are
more clusters than you expect--

00:33:10.110 --> 00:33:11.550
than really are
there, then it'll

00:33:11.550 --> 00:33:14.920
start chopping up well-defined
clusters into sub-clusters.

00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:19.660
So here it split this elongated
one into two sub-clusters.

00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:21.420
It split this one
arbitrarily into two.

00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:25.677
Just so it gets the final
number that we asked for.

00:33:25.677 --> 00:33:27.010
Then how do you know what to do?

00:33:27.010 --> 00:33:29.500
Well, as I said, you don't--
there's no guarantee to know.

00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:31.670
But one thing you can
do is make this kind

00:33:31.670 --> 00:33:34.370
of plot, which shows for
different values of K

00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:40.500
on the x-axis, the sum of the
distances within the cluster.

00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:42.660
So the distance to the
centroid within each cluster

00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:44.080
on the y-axis.

00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:47.489
And as I increase the number
of K's, when I'm correctly

00:33:47.489 --> 00:33:49.280
[? purchasing ?] my
data, when there really

00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:52.370
are more subgroups than
I've already defined,

00:33:52.370 --> 00:33:53.910
then I'll see big drops.

00:33:53.910 --> 00:33:56.530
So I go from saying there are
two to three in that case.

00:33:56.530 --> 00:34:00.189
I get a big drop in the distance
between members of the cluster.

00:34:00.189 --> 00:34:02.480
Because I'm no longer including
a data point over here.

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:06.010
And in this cluster, with a
data point in that cluster.

00:34:06.010 --> 00:34:09.489
But once I go beyond the
correct number, which was five,

00:34:09.489 --> 00:34:11.920
you see that the benefits
really start to trail off.

00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:13.820
So there's an
inflection point here.

00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:17.199
There's an elbow-- sometimes
it's called an elbow plot.

00:34:17.199 --> 00:34:19.270
After I go past
the right number,

00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:22.940
I get less and less benefit
from each additional clustering.

00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:25.760
So this gives us
an empirical way

00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:31.739
of choosing approximately
a correct value for K.

00:34:31.739 --> 00:34:33.840
Any questions on K-means?

00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:34.820
Yes?

00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:36.820
AUDIENCE: Does K-means
recapitulate the clusters

00:34:36.820 --> 00:34:38.195
that you would
get if you cut off

00:34:38.195 --> 00:34:41.710
your dendogram from hierarchical
clustering at a certain level?

00:34:41.710 --> 00:34:43.143
PROFESSOR: Not necessarily.

00:34:43.143 --> 00:34:44.499
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:34:44.499 --> 00:34:45.314
But maybe.

00:34:45.314 --> 00:34:45.855
I don't know.

00:34:45.855 --> 00:34:48.590
It sort of seems to me
as if you picked a level

00:34:48.590 --> 00:34:50.960
where you have a certain
number of clusters,

00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:53.585
that that's similar, at least by
centroid, by using the center?

00:34:53.585 --> 00:34:56.043
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I think because
of the way that you do it,

00:34:56.043 --> 00:34:58.120
you're not even guaranteed
to have a level, where

00:34:58.120 --> 00:35:01.725
you have exactly the
right-- other questions?

00:35:05.050 --> 00:35:06.052
Yes?

00:35:06.052 --> 00:35:07.593
AUDIENCE: Could you
just very quickly

00:35:07.593 --> 00:35:08.968
go over how you
initialized where

00:35:08.968 --> 00:35:11.050
the starting points
are, and the break ups?

00:35:11.050 --> 00:35:11.590
PROFESSOR: All right,
so the question

00:35:11.590 --> 00:35:13.470
is how do you initialize
the starting points?

00:35:13.470 --> 00:35:16.152
In fact, you have to make some
arbitrary decisions about how

00:35:16.152 --> 00:35:17.610
the initialize the
starting points.

00:35:17.610 --> 00:35:18.900
So they're usually
chose in a random.

00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:20.358
And you will get
different results,

00:35:20.358 --> 00:35:22.190
depending on how you do that.

00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:23.920
So that's another--
so when you do it,

00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:26.330
it's non-deterministic
in that sense.

00:35:26.330 --> 00:35:28.605
And you often want to
initialize multiple times.

00:35:28.605 --> 00:35:30.390
And make sure you
get similar results.

00:35:30.390 --> 00:35:32.350
Very good question.

00:35:32.350 --> 00:35:34.610
And in fact, that
was not a set up.

00:35:34.610 --> 00:35:37.690
But what happens if you
choose pathologically bad

00:35:37.690 --> 00:35:38.960
initial conditions?

00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:42.860
So you have the potential to
converge to the right answer.

00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:46.620
But you're not guaranteed to
converge to the right answer.

00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:50.510
So here's an example where
I had-- I guess there really

00:35:50.510 --> 00:35:52.277
are three clusters in the data.

00:35:52.277 --> 00:35:53.860
I chose [INAUDIBLE]
three, but I stuck

00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:57.270
all my initial coordinates down
in the lower right-hand corner.

00:35:57.270 --> 00:36:03.312
And then when I do the
clustering, if things go well,

00:36:03.312 --> 00:36:04.270
I get the right answer.

00:36:04.270 --> 00:36:05.311
But we're not guaranteed.

00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:14.610
But one thing we are guaranteed,
is we always get convergence.

00:36:14.610 --> 00:36:16.210
So the algorithm will converge.

00:36:16.210 --> 00:36:17.640
Because at each
step, it's either

00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:21.100
reducing the objective function,
or it's leaving it the same.

00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:22.460
So we're guaranteed convergence.

00:36:22.460 --> 00:36:24.960
But it may be as we've seen
previously in other settings,

00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:26.835
we may end up with local
minimum, rather than

00:36:26.835 --> 00:36:28.224
the global optimum.

00:36:28.224 --> 00:36:29.640
And the way to fix
that then would

00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:33.235
be to initialize again,
with new starting positions.

00:36:35.999 --> 00:36:36.665
Other questions?

00:36:44.229 --> 00:36:45.520
What about a setting like this?

00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:48.080
Where we've got two
well-defined clusters,

00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:50.260
and somebody who lives
straight in the middle.

00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:53.120
So what's the
algorithm going to do?

00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:55.640
Well, sometimes it'll put it
in one side, of one cluster.

00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:58.130
And sometimes it'll end
up in the other side.

00:36:58.130 --> 00:37:00.410
So an alternative to
K-means clustering,

00:37:00.410 --> 00:37:03.295
which has to make one or the
other arbitrary decision,

00:37:03.295 --> 00:37:06.230
is something that's called
fuzzy K-means, which

00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:07.950
can put something
actually literally,

00:37:07.950 --> 00:37:10.866
membership into both clusters.

00:37:10.866 --> 00:37:13.121
And it's very similar in
structure to the K-means,

00:37:13.121 --> 00:37:14.620
with one important
difference, which

00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:17.760
is a membership variable,
that tells you for every data

00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:20.450
point, how much it belongs
to the cluster one, cluster

00:37:20.450 --> 00:37:22.060
two, cluster three, and so on.

00:37:25.132 --> 00:37:26.590
So in both algorithms,
we start off

00:37:26.590 --> 00:37:29.180
by choosing initial
points as a cluster means,

00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:31.230
and looping through
each of them.

00:37:31.230 --> 00:37:34.670
Now previously, we would make
a hard assignment of each data

00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:38.650
point x sub i to
a single cluster.

00:37:38.650 --> 00:37:41.220
And here we're going to
calculate the probability

00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:42.995
that each data point
belongs to a cluster.

00:37:42.995 --> 00:37:44.620
And that's where you
get the fuzziness,

00:37:44.620 --> 00:37:48.930
because you could have a non
unit, or a nonzero probability,

00:37:48.930 --> 00:37:51.150
belonging to any
of the clusters.

00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:55.700
And now we're going, K-means,
we recalculated the mean value,

00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:59.550
by just looking at the average
of everybody in that cluster.

00:37:59.550 --> 00:38:02.295
Now in fuzzy K-means, we don't
have everybody in the cluster.

00:38:02.295 --> 00:38:04.420
Because everybody belongs
partially to the cluster.

00:38:04.420 --> 00:38:07.170
So we're going to take
a weighted average.

00:38:07.170 --> 00:38:10.010
So here are the details
of how you do that.

00:38:10.010 --> 00:38:12.160
In K-means, we are
minimizing this function.

00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:14.820
We were trying to decide the
class structure, the class

00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:18.390
memberships, that would minimize
the distance of every member

00:38:18.390 --> 00:38:22.770
of that cluster, to the defined
centroid of that cluster.

00:38:22.770 --> 00:38:24.030
Here it looks almost the same.

00:38:24.030 --> 00:38:26.560
Except we now have
this new variable, mu,

00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:27.890
which is the membership.

00:38:27.890 --> 00:38:32.147
It's the membership of
point j, in cluster i.

00:38:34.949 --> 00:38:37.380
So I'm trying to minimize
a very similar function.

00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:41.020
But now if mu is one--
if all my mus are one,

00:38:41.020 --> 00:38:42.270
then what do I get?

00:38:42.270 --> 00:38:43.400
K-means, right?

00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:45.710
But as soon as the mus are
allowed to vary from one,

00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:47.280
they can be between
zero and one,

00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:49.040
then points can
contribute more or less.

00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:52.160
So that point there was stuck in
the middle of the two clusters,

00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:54.370
if it had a mu of
0.5 for each, it

00:38:54.370 --> 00:38:55.620
would contribute half to each.

00:38:55.620 --> 00:38:57.090
And then both the
centroids would

00:38:57.090 --> 00:38:58.830
move a little bit
towards the middle.

00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:03.540
So what's the
result of K-means--

00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:05.530
I'm sorry, fuzzy
K-means clustering?

00:39:05.530 --> 00:39:06.840
We still get K clusters.

00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:10.730
But now every gene or every
object that we're clustering

00:39:10.730 --> 00:39:12.510
has a partial membership.

00:39:12.510 --> 00:39:15.050
So here's an example
of that, where

00:39:15.050 --> 00:39:17.339
they did K-means
clustering, with these six

00:39:17.339 --> 00:39:18.130
different clusters.

00:39:18.130 --> 00:39:22.190
But now every
profile, every gene,

00:39:22.190 --> 00:39:26.050
has a color associated with it,
that represents this mu value.

00:39:26.050 --> 00:39:29.210
Whether it goes from zero to
one, with these rainbow colors,

00:39:29.210 --> 00:39:32.570
to the things that
are reddish, or pink--

00:39:32.570 --> 00:39:34.155
those are the high
confidence things

00:39:34.155 --> 00:39:36.430
that are very strongly,
only in that cluster.

00:39:36.430 --> 00:39:37.895
Whereas the things that are
more towards the yellow end

00:39:37.895 --> 00:39:39.770
of the spectrum are
partially in this cluster

00:39:39.770 --> 00:39:43.450
and partially in other clusters.

00:39:43.450 --> 00:39:43.950
Questions?

00:39:43.950 --> 00:39:44.740
Any questions?

00:39:54.250 --> 00:39:58.790
So K-means, we've defined in
terms of Euclidean distance.

00:39:58.790 --> 00:40:02.530
And that has clear advantages,
in terms of computing things

00:40:02.530 --> 00:40:03.040
very easily.

00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:05.240
But it has some
disadvantages as well.

00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:08.010
So one of the disadvantages
is because we're

00:40:08.010 --> 00:40:10.650
using the squared
distance, then outliers

00:40:10.650 --> 00:40:12.570
have a very big effect.

00:40:12.570 --> 00:40:17.480
Because I'm squaring the
difference between vectors.

00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:18.910
That may not be the worst thing.

00:40:18.910 --> 00:40:20.700
But they also
restrict us to things

00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:22.700
for which we can
compute a centroid.

00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:25.040
We have to have data
that are-- four or more,

00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:27.530
you can actually
compute the mean value

00:40:27.530 --> 00:40:28.820
of all members of the cluster.

00:40:28.820 --> 00:40:30.050
Sometimes you want
to cluster things

00:40:30.050 --> 00:40:31.410
that we only have
qualitative data.

00:40:31.410 --> 00:40:33.201
Where instead of having
a distance measure,

00:40:33.201 --> 00:40:34.560
we have similarity.

00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:37.249
This doesn't come up
quite as often in-- well,

00:40:37.249 --> 00:40:39.415
it certainly doesn't come
up in gene expression data

00:40:39.415 --> 00:40:42.030
or [? RNAC. ?] But you can
imagine more qualitative data,

00:40:42.030 --> 00:40:44.360
where you ask people
about similarity

00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:48.150
between different things
or behavioral features,

00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:50.800
where you know the similarity
between two objects.

00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:53.600
But you have no way of
calculating the average object.

00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:56.270
One setting that you might
[INAUDIBLE] have looked

00:40:56.270 --> 00:40:59.030
at-- if you're trying to
cluster say, sequence motifs

00:40:59.030 --> 00:41:01.870
that you've computed
with the EM algorithm.

00:41:01.870 --> 00:41:03.746
So what's the average
sequence motif?

00:41:03.746 --> 00:41:05.870
That doesn't necessarily
represent any true object,

00:41:05.870 --> 00:41:06.380
right?

00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:08.430
You might be better off--
you can calculate it.

00:41:08.430 --> 00:41:09.650
But it doesn't mean anything.

00:41:09.650 --> 00:41:11.140
You might be better
off calculating

00:41:11.140 --> 00:41:15.550
using rather than the
average motif, the most

00:41:15.550 --> 00:41:17.870
central of the motifs that
you actually observed.

00:41:17.870 --> 00:41:20.362
So that would be called
a medoid, or an exemplar.

00:41:20.362 --> 00:41:22.820
It's a member of your cluster
that's closest to the middle,

00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:28.130
even if it it's not
smack dab in the middle.

00:41:28.130 --> 00:41:31.690
So instead of K-means, we can
just think, well, K-medoids.

00:41:31.690 --> 00:41:35.090
So in K-means, we actually
computed a centroid.

00:41:35.090 --> 00:41:37.910
And in medoids, we'll
choose the existing data

00:41:37.910 --> 00:41:41.730
point that's most central.

00:41:41.730 --> 00:41:42.770
So what does that mean?

00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:57.715
If these are my data, the true
mean is somewhere over here.

00:42:00.335 --> 00:42:01.460
But this one is the medoid.

00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:08.410
It's an exemplar that's
close to the central point.

00:42:08.410 --> 00:42:11.952
But if there actually
isn't anything here,

00:42:11.952 --> 00:42:12.660
then there isn't.

00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:14.618
So we're going to use
the thing that's closest.

00:42:14.618 --> 00:42:16.680
So if these were
all sequence motifs,

00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:18.550
rather than using some
sequence motif that

00:42:18.550 --> 00:42:20.600
doesn't exist as the
center of your cluster,

00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:22.960
you would use a sequence motif
that actually does exist,

00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:24.222
and it's close to the center.

00:42:29.870 --> 00:42:32.020
So it's a simple
variation on the K-means.

00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:39.540
Instead choosing K
points in arbitrary space

00:42:39.540 --> 00:42:41.600
as our starting
positions, we're going

00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:46.510
to choose K examples from the
data as our starting medoids.

00:42:46.510 --> 00:42:49.180
And then we're going to place
each point in the cluster that

00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:52.310
has the closest medoid,
rather than median.

00:42:52.310 --> 00:42:54.130
And then when we
do the update step,

00:42:54.130 --> 00:42:56.840
instead of choosing the
average position to represent

00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:59.592
the cluster, we'll
choose the medoid.

00:42:59.592 --> 00:43:03.860
The exemplar that's
closest to the middle.

00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:06.495
Any questions on this?

00:43:06.495 --> 00:43:06.995
Yes?

00:43:06.995 --> 00:43:08.453
AUDIENCE: So if
you use the medoid,

00:43:08.453 --> 00:43:10.306
do you lose the
guaranteed convergence?

00:43:10.306 --> 00:43:11.681
Because I can
picture a situation

00:43:11.681 --> 00:43:13.835
where you're sort of
oscillating because now

00:43:13.835 --> 00:43:15.034
you have a discrete stack.

00:43:15.034 --> 00:43:16.794
PROFESSOR: That's
a good question.

00:43:16.794 --> 00:43:17.710
That's probably right.

00:43:17.710 --> 00:43:18.835
Actually, I should
think about that.

00:43:18.835 --> 00:43:19.510
I"m not sure.

00:43:22.570 --> 00:43:25.034
Yeah, that's probably right.

00:43:25.034 --> 00:43:25.700
Other questions?

00:43:30.701 --> 00:43:31.200
OK.

00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:33.325
There are a lot of other
techniques for clustering.

00:43:33.325 --> 00:43:35.840
Your textbook talks about
self organizing maps,

00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:38.366
which were popular at
one point quite a lot.

00:43:38.366 --> 00:43:39.740
And there's also
a nice technique

00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:41.156
called affinity
propagation, which

00:43:41.156 --> 00:43:44.150
is a little bit outside
the scope of this course,

00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:48.880
but has proved quite
useful for clustering.

00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:49.380
OK.

00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:51.530
So why bother to do
all this clustering?

00:43:51.530 --> 00:43:54.960
Our goal is to try to find
some biological information,

00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:56.679
not just to find
groups of genes.

00:43:56.679 --> 00:43:58.220
So what can you do
with these things?

00:43:58.220 --> 00:44:01.120
Well, one thing that
was identified early on,

00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:04.270
is if I could find sets of genes
that behave similarly, maybe

00:44:04.270 --> 00:44:06.300
those could be used
in a predictive way,

00:44:06.300 --> 00:44:08.340
to predict outcomes
for patients,

00:44:08.340 --> 00:44:11.130
or some biological function.

00:44:11.130 --> 00:44:14.320
So we're going to
look at that first.

00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:17.500
So one of the early
papers in this field

00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:20.220
did clustering of
microarrays for patients

00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:22.720
who had B-cell lymphoma.

00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:25.835
The patients had different
kinds of B-cell lymphomas.

00:44:25.835 --> 00:44:28.910
And so they took their
data, they clustered it.

00:44:28.910 --> 00:44:31.610
Again, each row
represents a gene.

00:44:31.610 --> 00:44:33.819
And each column
represents a patient here.

00:44:33.819 --> 00:44:36.110
And with this projector, it's
a little bit hard to see.

00:44:36.110 --> 00:44:38.060
But when you look at
the notes separately,

00:44:38.060 --> 00:44:40.990
you'll be able see
that in the dendogram,

00:44:40.990 --> 00:44:43.420
there's a nice, sharp
division between two

00:44:43.420 --> 00:44:45.270
large groups of patients.

00:44:45.270 --> 00:44:48.824
And it turns out that when
you look at the pathologist's

00:44:48.824 --> 00:44:50.990
annotations for these
patients, which was completely

00:44:50.990 --> 00:44:52.760
independent of the
gene expression data,

00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:54.942
all of patients in
the left hand group--

00:44:54.942 --> 00:44:56.900
almost all the patients
in the left hand group,

00:44:56.900 --> 00:44:59.627
had one kind of lymphoma.

00:44:59.627 --> 00:45:01.460
And all the patients
in the right hand group

00:45:01.460 --> 00:45:02.925
had a different
kind of lymphoma.

00:45:02.925 --> 00:45:04.300
And this got people
very excited.

00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:07.320
Because it suggested that
the pure molecular features

00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:10.815
might be at least as good
as pathological studies.

00:45:10.815 --> 00:45:13.530
So maybe you could completely
automate the identification

00:45:13.530 --> 00:45:15.390
of different tumor types.

00:45:15.390 --> 00:45:17.760
Now the next thing that got
people even more excited,

00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:19.660
was the idea that maybe
you could actually

00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:23.330
use these patterns not
just to recapitulate

00:45:23.330 --> 00:45:25.590
what a pathologist would
find, but go beyond it,

00:45:25.590 --> 00:45:28.102
and actually make predictions
from the patients.

00:45:28.102 --> 00:45:29.810
So in these plots--
I don't know if we've

00:45:29.810 --> 00:45:31.268
seen these before
yet in the class.

00:45:31.268 --> 00:45:34.360
But on the x-axis is survival.

00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:36.240
In the y-axis are the
fraction of patients

00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:39.360
in a particular group,
who survived that long.

00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:40.870
So as the patient's
die, obviously

00:45:40.870 --> 00:45:42.520
the curve is dropping down.

00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:45.110
Each one of these
drops represents

00:45:45.110 --> 00:45:47.280
the death of a patient,
or the loss of the patient

00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:51.110
to the study for other reasons.

00:45:51.110 --> 00:45:53.690
And so in the middle,
let's start with this one.

00:45:53.690 --> 00:45:55.730
This is what the clinicians
would have decided.

00:45:55.730 --> 00:45:57.610
There are here, patients
that they defined

00:45:57.610 --> 00:46:00.247
by clinical standards as
being likely to do well,

00:46:00.247 --> 00:46:02.580
versus patients whom they
defined by clinical standards,

00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:03.619
as likely to do poorly.

00:46:03.619 --> 00:46:05.410
And you could see there
is a big difference

00:46:05.410 --> 00:46:07.420
in the plots for the
low clinical risk

00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:10.120
patients at the top, and
the high clinical risk

00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:11.750
patients at the bottom.

00:46:11.750 --> 00:46:13.600
On the left hand
side, or what you

00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:15.750
get when you use purely
gene expression data

00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:18.630
to cluster the patients into
groups that you turn out

00:46:18.630 --> 00:46:20.800
to be high risk or low risk.

00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:23.370
And you can see that
it's a little bit more

00:46:23.370 --> 00:46:25.610
statistically significant
for the clinical risk.

00:46:25.610 --> 00:46:27.870
But it's pretty
good over here, too.

00:46:27.870 --> 00:46:30.350
Now the really
impressive thing is,

00:46:30.350 --> 00:46:32.600
what if you take the
patients that the clinicians

00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:35.750
define as low clinical risk?

00:46:35.750 --> 00:46:38.290
And then you look at their
gene expression data.

00:46:38.290 --> 00:46:39.900
Could you separate
out the patients

00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:41.571
in that allegedly
low clinical risk

00:46:41.571 --> 00:46:42.820
who are actually at high risk?

00:46:42.820 --> 00:46:44.760
And maybe then they
would be diverted

00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:46.840
to have more aggressive
therapy than patients

00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:49.430
who really and truly
are low risk patients.

00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:51.500
And what they will
show with just barely

00:46:51.500 --> 00:46:53.340
statistical significance,
is that even

00:46:53.340 --> 00:46:56.280
among the clinically
defined low risk patients,

00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:58.792
there is-- based on
these gene signatures--

00:46:58.792 --> 00:47:00.250
the ability to
distinguish patients

00:47:00.250 --> 00:47:02.600
who are going to do
better, and patients

00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:04.990
who are going to do worse.

00:47:04.990 --> 00:47:06.391
So this was over a decade ago.

00:47:06.391 --> 00:47:08.390
And it really set off a
frenzy of people looking

00:47:08.390 --> 00:47:10.720
for gene signatures for
all sorts of things,

00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:12.740
that might be highly predictive.

00:47:12.740 --> 00:47:17.090
Now the fact that
something is correlated,

00:47:17.090 --> 00:47:18.990
doesn't of course
prove any causality.

00:47:18.990 --> 00:47:22.660
So one of the questions is, if
I find a gene signature that

00:47:22.660 --> 00:47:25.272
is predictive of an outcome
in one of the studies,

00:47:25.272 --> 00:47:27.230
can I use it then to go
backwards, and actually

00:47:27.230 --> 00:47:28.810
define a therapy?

00:47:28.810 --> 00:47:32.560
In the ideal setting, I would
have these gene signatures.

00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:34.290
I'd discover that
they are clinically

00:47:34.290 --> 00:47:36.080
associated with outcome.

00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:38.180
I could dig in and
discover what makes

00:47:38.180 --> 00:47:40.720
the patients to do worse, worse.

00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:41.650
And go and treat that.

00:47:41.650 --> 00:47:43.460
So is that the case or not?

00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:47.397
So let me show you some data
from a breast cancer data set.

00:47:47.397 --> 00:47:48.730
Here's a breast cancer data set.

00:47:48.730 --> 00:47:52.350
Again the same kind of plot,
where we've got the survival

00:47:52.350 --> 00:47:56.780
statistic on the y-axis, the
number of years on the x-axis.

00:47:56.780 --> 00:47:59.160
And based on a gene
signature, this group

00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:01.350
has defined a group
that does better,

00:48:01.350 --> 00:48:04.990
and a group that does worse,
the p value is significant.

00:48:04.990 --> 00:48:11.250
And it has a ratio, the
death rate versus control

00:48:11.250 --> 00:48:12.910
is approximately two.

00:48:12.910 --> 00:48:13.620
OK.

00:48:13.620 --> 00:48:16.709
So does this lead us to
any mechanistic insight

00:48:16.709 --> 00:48:17.500
into breast cancer.

00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:20.340
Well, it turns out in this
case, the gene signature

00:48:20.340 --> 00:48:24.390
was defined based on
postprandial laughter.

00:48:24.390 --> 00:48:26.984
So after dinner humor.

00:48:26.984 --> 00:48:28.650
Here's a gene set
that defined something

00:48:28.650 --> 00:48:31.090
that has absolutely nothing
to do with breast cancer,

00:48:31.090 --> 00:48:35.137
and it's predicting the outcome
of breast cancer patients.

00:48:35.137 --> 00:48:36.720
Which leads to
somewhat more of a joke

00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:38.200
that the testing
whether laughter

00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:40.520
really is the best medicine.

00:48:40.520 --> 00:48:41.050
OK.

00:48:41.050 --> 00:48:44.350
So they went on-- they
tried other genes sets.

00:48:44.350 --> 00:48:46.490
Here's the data
set-- gene set that's

00:48:46.490 --> 00:48:47.900
not even defined in humans.

00:48:47.900 --> 00:48:52.240
It's the homologs of
genes that are associated

00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:53.930
with social defeat in mice.

00:48:53.930 --> 00:48:58.670
And once again, you get a
statistically significant

00:48:58.670 --> 00:49:00.929
p-value, and good hazard ratios.

00:49:00.929 --> 00:49:01.720
So what's going on?

00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:03.930
Well, these are not from
a study that's actually

00:49:03.930 --> 00:49:06.130
trying to predict an
outcome in breast cancer.

00:49:06.130 --> 00:49:09.290
It's a study that shows
that most gene expression--

00:49:09.290 --> 00:49:12.360
most randomly selected
sets of genes in the genome

00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:15.810
will give an outcome that's
correlated-- a result that's

00:49:15.810 --> 00:49:18.130
correlated with a patient
outcome in breast cancer.

00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:21.721
Yes?

00:49:21.721 --> 00:49:23.054
AUDIENCE: I'm a little confused.

00:49:23.054 --> 00:49:25.679
In the previous graph, could you
just explain what is the black

00:49:25.679 --> 00:49:26.958
and what is the red?

00:49:26.958 --> 00:49:29.400
Is that individuals or groups?

00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:32.080
PROFESSOR: So the
black are people

00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:34.350
that have the genes
set signature, who

00:49:34.350 --> 00:49:36.265
have high levels
of the genes that

00:49:36.265 --> 00:49:37.969
are defined in this gene set.

00:49:37.969 --> 00:49:40.260
And the red are ones have
low, or the other way around.

00:49:40.260 --> 00:49:43.360
But it's defining all patients
into two groups, based

00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:46.890
on whether they have a
particular level of expression

00:49:46.890 --> 00:49:49.329
in this gene set,
and then following

00:49:49.329 --> 00:49:50.370
those patients over time.

00:49:50.370 --> 00:49:51.849
Do they do better or worse?

00:49:51.849 --> 00:49:53.265
And similarly for
all these plots.

00:49:57.950 --> 00:50:00.775
And he had another one which is
a little less amusing, location

00:50:00.775 --> 00:50:02.710
of skin fibroblasts.

00:50:02.710 --> 00:50:05.820
The real critical point is this.

00:50:05.820 --> 00:50:10.270
Here, they compared
the probability

00:50:10.270 --> 00:50:14.630
based on expectation
an that all genes are

00:50:14.630 --> 00:50:16.830
independent of each
other, the probability

00:50:16.830 --> 00:50:20.510
that that gene signatures
correlated with outcome,

00:50:20.510 --> 00:50:22.700
for genes there were chosen
at random or genes that

00:50:22.700 --> 00:50:25.960
were chosen from a database
of gene signatures,

00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:28.910
that people have identified as
being associated with pathways.

00:50:28.910 --> 00:50:30.850
And you get a very,
very large fraction.

00:50:30.850 --> 00:50:32.380
So this is the p-value.

00:50:32.380 --> 00:50:35.450
So negative log of
p-value, so negative values

00:50:35.450 --> 00:50:36.570
are more significant.

00:50:36.570 --> 00:50:38.910
A huge fraction
of all genes sets

00:50:38.910 --> 00:50:41.130
that you pull at
random from the genome,

00:50:41.130 --> 00:50:43.670
or that you pull from a
compendium of known pathways,

00:50:43.670 --> 00:50:46.010
are going to be
associated with outcome,

00:50:46.010 --> 00:50:48.090
in this breast cancer data set.

00:50:48.090 --> 00:50:51.120
So it's not just well
annotated cancer pathways,

00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:52.180
that are associated.

00:50:52.180 --> 00:50:54.400
Its gene sets
associated as we've

00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:57.200
seen, with laughter or
social defeat in mice,

00:50:57.200 --> 00:50:59.260
and so on-- all sorts
of crazy things,

00:50:59.260 --> 00:51:05.100
that have no mechanistic
link to breast cancer.

00:51:05.100 --> 00:51:08.510
Let's take a second
for that to sink in.

00:51:08.510 --> 00:51:11.350
I pull genes at random
from the genome.

00:51:11.350 --> 00:51:13.520
I define patients
based on whether they

00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:16.260
have high levels of expression
of a random set of genes,

00:51:16.260 --> 00:51:19.100
or low levels of expression
of that random set of genes.

00:51:19.100 --> 00:51:21.970
And I'm extremely likely
to be able to predict

00:51:21.970 --> 00:51:23.210
the outcome in breast cancer.

00:51:25.919 --> 00:51:27.710
So that should be rather
disturbing, right?

00:51:27.710 --> 00:51:30.230
So it turns out-- before
we get to the answer

00:51:30.230 --> 00:51:33.005
then-- so this is not
unique to breast cancer.

00:51:33.005 --> 00:51:35.630
They went through a whole bunch
of data sets in the literature.

00:51:35.630 --> 00:51:38.180
Each row is a different
previously published study,

00:51:38.180 --> 00:51:41.170
where someone had claimed
to identify a signature

00:51:41.170 --> 00:51:45.510
for a particular kind
of disease or outcome.

00:51:45.510 --> 00:51:48.460
And they took their
random gene sets and asked

00:51:48.460 --> 00:51:50.060
how well the random
genes sets did

00:51:50.060 --> 00:51:53.420
in predicting the outcome
in these patients?

00:51:53.420 --> 00:51:56.785
And so these yellow
plots represent

00:51:56.785 --> 00:51:59.090
the probability distribution
for the random gene

00:51:59.090 --> 00:52:00.971
sets-- again on
this projector, it's

00:52:00.971 --> 00:52:03.220
hard to see-- but there's a
highlight in the left hand

00:52:03.220 --> 00:52:07.694
side at where the 5%, the best
5% of the random gene sets are.

00:52:07.694 --> 00:52:09.110
This blue line is
the near measure

00:52:09.110 --> 00:52:10.280
of statistical significance.

00:52:10.280 --> 00:52:12.200
It turns out that a
few of these studies

00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:15.270
didn't even reach a normal level
of statistical significance,

00:52:15.270 --> 00:52:18.160
let alone comparing
to random gene sets.

00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:21.500
But for most of
these, you don't do

00:52:21.500 --> 00:52:24.620
better than a good fraction
of the randomly selected gene

00:52:24.620 --> 00:52:25.630
sets.

00:52:25.630 --> 00:52:27.030
So how could this be?

00:52:27.030 --> 00:52:29.740
So it turns out there is an
answer to why this happens.

00:52:29.740 --> 00:52:31.580
And it's really
quite fascinating.

00:52:31.580 --> 00:52:33.547
So here, we're using
the hazard ratio,

00:52:33.547 --> 00:52:35.380
which is the death rate
for the patients who

00:52:35.380 --> 00:52:38.550
have the signature,
over the control group.

00:52:38.550 --> 00:52:41.180
So high hazard ratio means
it's a very, very dissociative

00:52:41.180 --> 00:52:42.180
outcome.

00:52:42.180 --> 00:52:46.102
And they've plotted that against
the correlation of the genes

00:52:46.102 --> 00:52:48.560
in the gene signature, with
the expression of a gene called

00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:53.610
PCNA, Proliferating
Cell Nuclear Antigen

00:52:53.610 --> 00:52:56.555
And it turns out a very, very
large fraction of the genome

00:52:56.555 --> 00:52:57.180
is coexpressed.

00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:03.640
So genes are not expressed like
random, completely independent

00:53:03.640 --> 00:53:05.060
random variables.

00:53:05.060 --> 00:53:07.550
There are lots of genes that
show very similar expression

00:53:07.550 --> 00:53:09.330
levels, across
all the data sets.

00:53:09.330 --> 00:53:12.105
Now PCNA is a gene that's
been known by pathologists

00:53:12.105 --> 00:53:13.480
for a long time,
as having higher

00:53:13.480 --> 00:53:15.677
levels than most
digressive tumors.

00:53:15.677 --> 00:53:17.510
So a very, very large
fraction of the genome

00:53:17.510 --> 00:53:20.160
is coexpressed with PCNA.

00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:22.590
Then high levels of
randomly selected genes

00:53:22.590 --> 00:53:24.950
are going to be a very good
predictor of tumor outcome.

00:53:24.950 --> 00:53:26.908
Because high levels of
randomly expressed genes

00:53:26.908 --> 00:53:28.500
also means a very
high probability

00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:32.270
of having a high level PCNA,
which is a tumor marker.

00:53:35.930 --> 00:53:37.800
So we have to proceed
with a lot of caution.

00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:41.310
We can find things that are
highly correlated with outcome,

00:53:41.310 --> 00:53:45.690
that could have good value in
terms of prognostic indicators.

00:53:45.690 --> 00:53:47.690
But there are going to
be a lot of possibilities

00:53:47.690 --> 00:53:50.390
for sets of genes that
have that property,

00:53:50.390 --> 00:53:52.130
they're good
predictors of outcome.

00:53:52.130 --> 00:53:54.360
And many of them will
have absolutely nothing

00:53:54.360 --> 00:53:59.170
to causally, with the
process of the disease.

00:53:59.170 --> 00:54:02.110
So at the very least, it means
don't start a drug company

00:54:02.110 --> 00:54:04.010
over every set of genes,
if you identify this

00:54:04.010 --> 00:54:05.620
as associated with outcome.

00:54:05.620 --> 00:54:07.120
But the worst case
scenario, it also

00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:09.760
means that those predictions
will break down under settings

00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:12.580
that we haven't yet examined.

00:54:12.580 --> 00:54:14.410
And so that's the
real fear, that you

00:54:14.410 --> 00:54:16.140
have a gene set
signature that you think

00:54:16.140 --> 00:54:17.473
has a highly predictive outcome.

00:54:17.473 --> 00:54:20.247
It's only because you looked at
a particular set of patients.

00:54:20.247 --> 00:54:22.080
But you look at a
different set of patients,

00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:24.870
and that correlation
will break down.

00:54:24.870 --> 00:54:27.810
So this is an area of research
that's still quite in flux,

00:54:27.810 --> 00:54:29.460
in terms of how
much utility there

00:54:29.460 --> 00:54:32.160
will be in identifying
genes set signatures,

00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:33.827
in this completely
objective way.

00:54:33.827 --> 00:54:35.826
And what we'll see in the
course of this lecture

00:54:35.826 --> 00:54:37.243
and the next one,
is it's probably

00:54:37.243 --> 00:54:39.034
going to be much more
useful to incorporate

00:54:39.034 --> 00:54:40.980
other kinds of information
that will constrain

00:54:40.980 --> 00:54:42.063
us to be more mechanistic.

00:54:44.267 --> 00:54:44.850
Any questions?

00:54:51.892 --> 00:54:52.392
All right.

00:54:52.392 --> 00:54:54.308
So now we're going to
really get into the meat

00:54:54.308 --> 00:54:56.295
of the identification
of gene modules.

00:54:56.295 --> 00:54:59.560
And we're going to try to
see how much we can learn

00:54:59.560 --> 00:55:02.310
about regulatory structure
from the gene expression data.

00:55:02.310 --> 00:55:05.395
So we're going to move up from
just the pure expression data--

00:55:05.395 --> 00:55:07.520
say these genes at the
bottom, to try to figure out

00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:10.225
what set of transcription
factors we're driving,

00:55:10.225 --> 00:55:12.225
and maybe what signaling
pathways lived upstream

00:55:12.225 --> 00:55:14.497
in those transcription
factors, and turn them on.

00:55:14.497 --> 00:55:17.080
And the fundamental difference
then between clustering-- which

00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:19.610
is what we've been looking in
until now, and these modules,

00:55:19.610 --> 00:55:21.542
as people like to call
them-- is that you

00:55:21.542 --> 00:55:23.500
can have a whole bunch
of genes, and we've just

00:55:23.500 --> 00:55:25.458
seen that, that are
correlated with each other,

00:55:25.458 --> 00:55:27.350
without being causally
linked to each other.

00:55:27.350 --> 00:55:30.290
So we like to figure out which
ones are actually functionally

00:55:30.290 --> 00:55:34.202
related, and not just
statistically related.

00:55:34.202 --> 00:55:36.410
And the paper that's going
to serve as our organizing

00:55:36.410 --> 00:55:38.400
principle in the
rest of this lecture,

00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:40.580
maybe bleeding into
the next lecture,

00:55:40.580 --> 00:55:42.910
is this paper,
recently published

00:55:42.910 --> 00:55:45.817
that's called The
DREAM5 Challenge.

00:55:45.817 --> 00:55:48.150
And this, like some of these
other challenges that we've

00:55:48.150 --> 00:55:51.950
seen before, is the case where
the organizers have data sets,

00:55:51.950 --> 00:55:55.370
where are they know
the answer to what

00:55:55.370 --> 00:55:57.230
the regulatory structure is.

00:55:57.230 --> 00:55:58.420
They send out the data.

00:55:58.420 --> 00:56:00.200
People try to make the
best predictions they can.

00:56:00.200 --> 00:56:01.741
And then they unseal
the data, to let

00:56:01.741 --> 00:56:03.495
people know how well they did.

00:56:03.495 --> 00:56:06.480
And so you can get a
relatively objective view

00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:09.920
of how well different
kinds of approaches work.

00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:12.700
So this is the overall
structure of this challenge.

00:56:12.700 --> 00:56:15.600
They had four different
kinds of data.

00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:18.990
Three are real data sets from
different organisms, E. coli,

00:56:18.990 --> 00:56:21.610
yeast, and
Staphylococcus aureus.

00:56:21.610 --> 00:56:23.940
And then the fourth one,
the one at the top here,

00:56:23.940 --> 00:56:26.780
is completely synthetic
data that they generated it.

00:56:26.780 --> 00:56:29.190
And you get a sense of the
scale of the data sets.

00:56:29.190 --> 00:56:33.300
So how many genes are involved,
how many potential regulators.

00:56:33.300 --> 00:56:36.920
In some cases, they've given
you specific information

00:56:36.920 --> 00:56:41.600
on knockouts, antibiotics,
toxins, that are perturbing.

00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:43.990
And again here, the
number of conditions that

00:56:43.990 --> 00:56:46.170
are being looked at,
the number of arrays.

00:56:46.170 --> 00:56:48.170
So then they provide
this data in a way

00:56:48.170 --> 00:56:51.401
that's very hard
for the groups that

00:56:51.401 --> 00:56:53.525
are analyzing to trace it
back to particular genes.

00:56:53.525 --> 00:56:56.680
Because you don't want people to
use external data necessarily,

00:56:56.680 --> 00:56:58.150
to make their predictions.

00:56:58.150 --> 00:57:00.600
So every makes
their predictions.

00:57:00.600 --> 00:57:03.830
They also, as part
of this challenge,

00:57:03.830 --> 00:57:06.390
they actually they made
their own metapredictions,

00:57:06.390 --> 00:57:08.447
based on the
individual predictions

00:57:08.447 --> 00:57:09.280
by different groups.

00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:11.140
And we'll take a look
at that in a second.

00:57:11.140 --> 00:57:14.014
And then they score
how well they did.

00:57:14.014 --> 00:57:16.430
Now we'll get into the details
of the scoring a little bit

00:57:16.430 --> 00:57:16.930
later.

00:57:16.930 --> 00:57:18.790
But what they found
at the highest levels,

00:57:18.790 --> 00:57:22.070
that different kinds of
methods behaved similarly.

00:57:22.070 --> 00:57:24.040
So the main groups
that they found

00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:25.770
were these regression-based
techniques.

00:57:25.770 --> 00:57:27.477
We'll talk about
those in a second.

00:57:27.477 --> 00:57:29.060
Bayesian networks,
which we've already

00:57:29.060 --> 00:57:32.180
discussed in a
different context.

00:57:32.180 --> 00:57:33.930
A hodgepodge of different
kinds of things.

00:57:33.930 --> 00:57:36.970
And then mutual information
and correlation.

00:57:36.970 --> 00:57:40.674
So we're going to look in
each of these main categories

00:57:40.674 --> 00:57:41.590
of prediction methods.

00:57:43.665 --> 00:57:46.040
So we're going to start with
the Bayesian networks, which

00:57:46.040 --> 00:57:47.490
we just finished talking
about in a completely

00:57:47.490 --> 00:57:48.570
different context.

00:57:48.570 --> 00:57:51.420
Here, instead of trying to
predict whether interaction

00:57:51.420 --> 00:57:53.139
is true, based on the
experimental data,

00:57:53.139 --> 00:57:55.680
we're going to try to predict
whether a particular protein is

00:57:55.680 --> 00:57:58.263
involved in regulating a set of
genes, based on the expression

00:57:58.263 --> 00:57:59.910
data.

00:57:59.910 --> 00:58:04.200
So in this context-- let's
say I have cancer data sets,

00:58:04.200 --> 00:58:07.005
and I wanted to decide
whether p53 is activated

00:58:07.005 --> 00:58:11.090
in those tumors, So this
is a known pathway for p53.

00:58:11.090 --> 00:58:13.320
So if I told you
the pathway, how

00:58:13.320 --> 00:58:16.170
might you figure out if p53
is active from gene expression

00:58:16.170 --> 00:58:19.060
data?

00:58:19.060 --> 00:58:21.640
I tell you this pathway, give
you this expression data--

00:58:21.640 --> 00:58:23.980
what's kind of a simple
thing that you could do right

00:58:23.980 --> 00:58:27.380
away, to decide whether you
think p53 is active or not?

00:58:27.380 --> 00:58:28.995
p53 is a transcriptional
activator,

00:58:28.995 --> 00:58:31.910
but it should be turning
on the genes of its targets

00:58:31.910 --> 00:58:33.210
when its on.

00:58:33.210 --> 00:58:36.159
So what's an
obvious thing to do?

00:58:36.159 --> 00:58:38.450
AUDIENCE: Check the expression
levels from the targets.

00:58:38.450 --> 00:58:38.660
PROFESSOR: Thank you.

00:58:38.660 --> 00:58:40.618
Right, so we could check
the expression levels.

00:58:40.618 --> 00:58:43.670
The targets compute some
simple statistics, right?

00:58:43.670 --> 00:58:44.290
OK.

00:58:44.290 --> 00:58:45.620
Well, that could work.

00:58:45.620 --> 00:58:47.080
But of course there could
be other transcriptional

00:58:47.080 --> 00:58:49.080
regulators that regulate
a similar set of genes.

00:58:49.080 --> 00:58:52.010
So that's not a
guarantee that p53 is on.

00:58:52.010 --> 00:58:55.510
It might be some other
transcriptional regulator.

00:58:55.510 --> 00:58:58.560
We could look for the
pathways that activate p53.

00:58:58.560 --> 00:59:01.210
We could ask whether
those genes are on.

00:59:01.210 --> 00:59:04.800
So we've got in this
pathway, a bunch of kinases,

00:59:04.800 --> 00:59:08.422
an ATM, CHK1, and so
on, that activate p53.

00:59:08.422 --> 00:59:10.380
Now if we had proteomic
data, we could actually

00:59:10.380 --> 00:59:12.409
look whether those proteins
are phosphorylated.

00:59:12.409 --> 00:59:14.200
But we have much, much
less proteomic data.

00:59:14.200 --> 00:59:16.770
And most of these settings
only have gene expression data.

00:59:16.770 --> 00:59:18.810
But you look at, is
that gene expressed?

00:59:18.810 --> 00:59:21.160
Has the expression of one
of these activating proteins

00:59:21.160 --> 00:59:21.850
gone up?

00:59:21.850 --> 00:59:23.880
And you can try to
make an inference then.

00:59:23.880 --> 00:59:26.900
From whether there's more of
these activating proteins,

00:59:26.900 --> 00:59:28.640
then maybe p53 is active.

00:59:28.640 --> 00:59:31.490
And therefore it's
turning on it's targets.

00:59:31.490 --> 00:59:32.840
That's one step removed.

00:59:32.840 --> 00:59:35.916
So just the fact that there's
a lot of ATM mRNA around

00:59:35.916 --> 00:59:38.290
doesn't mean that there's a
lot of the ATM protein, which

00:59:38.290 --> 00:59:40.498
certainly doesn't mean that
the ATM is phosphorylated

00:59:40.498 --> 00:59:41.930
and turning on its target.

00:59:41.930 --> 00:59:43.685
So again, we don't
have a guarantee there.

00:59:46.792 --> 00:59:49.000
We could look more specifically
whether the genes are

00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:50.550
differentially expressed.

00:59:50.550 --> 00:59:53.130
So the fact that they're on
may not be as informative

00:59:53.130 --> 00:59:55.240
as if they were uniquely
on in this tumor,

00:59:55.240 --> 00:59:58.740
and not on in control cells
from the same patient.

00:59:58.740 --> 01:00:01.080
So that can be informative.

01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:02.600
But again changes
in gene expression

01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:05.920
are not uniquely related to
changes in protein level.

01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:09.230
So we're going to have to
behave with a bit of caution.

01:00:09.230 --> 01:00:11.750
So the first step we're going
to take in this direction,

01:00:11.750 --> 01:00:13.335
is try to build a
Bayesian network.

01:00:13.335 --> 01:00:15.710
That's going to give us a way
to reason probabilistically

01:00:15.710 --> 01:00:19.090
over all of these kinds of data,
which by themselves are not

01:00:19.090 --> 01:00:21.770
great guarantees that we're
getting the right answer.

01:00:21.770 --> 01:00:25.470
Just like in the protein
prediction interaction problem,

01:00:25.470 --> 01:00:28.920
where individually coexpression
wasn't all that great,

01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:30.680
essentiality wasn't
all that great.

01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:33.509
But taken together, they
could be quite helpful.

01:00:33.509 --> 01:00:35.050
So we want to compute
the probability

01:00:35.050 --> 01:00:39.330
that the p53 pathway is
active, given the data.

01:00:39.330 --> 01:00:41.710
And the only data we're
going to have in the setting

01:00:41.710 --> 01:00:42.910
is gene expression data.

01:00:42.910 --> 01:00:45.950
So we're going to assume
that for the targets

01:00:45.950 --> 01:00:48.210
of a transcription
factor to be active,

01:00:48.210 --> 01:00:50.170
the transcription
factor itself has

01:00:50.170 --> 01:00:52.310
to be expressed
at a higher level.

01:00:52.310 --> 01:00:53.800
That's a restriction
of analyzing

01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:57.070
these kinds of data
that's very commonly used.

01:00:57.070 --> 01:01:00.190
So we're going to try to
compute the probability that p53

01:01:00.190 --> 01:01:02.340
is activated, given the data.

01:01:02.340 --> 01:01:04.750
So how would I compute
the probability,

01:01:04.750 --> 01:01:06.980
that given that some
transcription factors on,

01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:09.967
that I see expression
from target genes?

01:01:09.967 --> 01:01:10.800
How would I do this?

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:13.470
I would just go into the data,
and just count in the same way

01:01:13.470 --> 01:01:16.010
that we did in our
previous setting.

01:01:16.010 --> 01:01:18.680
We could just look over
all the experiments

01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:22.047
and tabulate whether one of the
targets is up in expression,

01:01:22.047 --> 01:01:24.380
how often is the transcription
factor that's potentially

01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:25.088
activating it up?

01:01:25.088 --> 01:01:29.300
And how often are all the
possible combinations the case?

01:01:29.300 --> 01:01:31.330
And then we can use
Bayesian statistics

01:01:31.330 --> 01:01:32.720
to try to compute
the probability

01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:35.860
that a transcription
factor is up, activated,

01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:37.860
given that I've seen the
gene expression data.

01:01:37.860 --> 01:01:38.443
Is that clear?

01:01:41.190 --> 01:01:41.690
Good.

01:01:46.410 --> 01:01:49.854
So we want to try to not include
just the down stream factors.

01:01:49.854 --> 01:01:51.520
Because that leads
possibly, maybe there

01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:52.940
are multiple
transcription factors

01:01:52.940 --> 01:01:54.610
that are equally
likely to be driving

01:01:54.610 --> 01:01:56.060
expressions instead of genes.

01:01:56.060 --> 01:01:59.020
We want to include the
upstream regulators as well.

01:01:59.020 --> 01:02:01.504
And so here, we're going
to take advantage of one

01:02:01.504 --> 01:02:02.920
of the properties
of Bayesian nets

01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:05.245
at where we looked
at, explaining a way.

01:02:05.245 --> 01:02:06.990
And you'll remember
this example, where

01:02:06.990 --> 01:02:10.940
we decided that if see
that the grass is wet,

01:02:10.940 --> 01:02:12.470
and I know that
it's raining, then

01:02:12.470 --> 01:02:15.910
I can consider less likely
that the sprinklers were on.

01:02:15.910 --> 01:02:18.280
Even though there's no causal
relationship between them.

01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:21.640
So if I see that a set of
targets of transcription factor

01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:25.410
A are on, and I have evidence
that the pathway upstream of A

01:02:25.410 --> 01:02:29.740
is on, that reduces my
inferred probability

01:02:29.740 --> 01:02:32.544
that the transcription
factor B is responsible.

01:02:32.544 --> 01:02:34.710
So that's of the nice things
about Bayesian networks

01:02:34.710 --> 01:02:37.010
that gives us a way of
reasoning automatically,

01:02:37.010 --> 01:02:41.090
over all the data, and not
just the down stream targets.

01:02:41.090 --> 01:02:43.330
And the Bayesian networks
can have multiple layers.

01:02:43.330 --> 01:02:44.955
So we can have one
transcription factor

01:02:44.955 --> 01:02:46.621
turning another one,
turns on other one,

01:02:46.621 --> 01:02:47.502
turns on another one.

01:02:47.502 --> 01:02:49.460
Again, we can have as
many layers as necessary.

01:02:49.460 --> 01:02:51.650
But one thing we
can't have are cycles.

01:02:51.650 --> 01:02:54.380
So we can't have a
transcription factor

01:02:54.380 --> 01:02:56.750
that's at the bottom of this,
going back and activating

01:02:56.750 --> 01:02:58.420
things that are at the top.

01:02:58.420 --> 01:02:59.890
And that's a
fundamental limitation

01:02:59.890 --> 01:03:00.810
of Bayesian networks.

01:03:04.362 --> 01:03:05.820
We've already talked
about the fact

01:03:05.820 --> 01:03:09.000
that in Bayesian networks,
with these two problems that we

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:12.150
to have to solve, we have to be
able to define the structure.

01:03:12.150 --> 01:03:13.400
If we don't know any a priori.

01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:14.570
Here, we don't
know what a priori.

01:03:14.570 --> 01:03:16.530
So we're going to have to learn
the structure of the network.

01:03:16.530 --> 01:03:17.920
And then with the
structure of the network,

01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:19.480
we're going to have to
learn all the probabilities.

01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:21.021
So the conditional
probability tables

01:03:21.021 --> 01:03:23.810
that relate to each
variable to every other one.

01:03:23.810 --> 01:03:27.320
And then just two more
small points about it.

01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:30.690
So if I just give
you expression data,

01:03:30.690 --> 01:03:33.540
without any interventions--
just the observations,

01:03:33.540 --> 01:03:37.770
then I can't decide what is a
cause and what is an effect.

01:03:37.770 --> 01:03:40.540
So here this was done in
the context of proteomics,

01:03:40.540 --> 01:03:42.760
but the same is true for
gene expression data.

01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:46.050
If I have two variables, x and
y, that are highly correlated,

01:03:46.050 --> 01:03:47.540
it could be that x activates y.

01:03:47.540 --> 01:03:50.340
It could be that y activates x.

01:03:50.340 --> 01:03:53.440
But if I perturb the system,
and I block the activity of one

01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:55.225
of these two genes
or proteins, then I

01:03:55.225 --> 01:03:56.600
can start to tell
the difference.

01:03:56.600 --> 01:04:00.290
In this case, if
you inhibit x, you

01:04:00.290 --> 01:04:02.010
don't see any activation of y.

01:04:02.010 --> 01:04:04.100
That's the yellow,
all down here.

01:04:04.100 --> 01:04:05.970
But if you inhibit y,
you see the full range

01:04:05.970 --> 01:04:06.767
of activity of x.

01:04:10.180 --> 01:04:13.710
So that implies that x
is the activator of y.

01:04:13.710 --> 01:04:16.209
And so in these settings, if
you want to learn a Bayesian

01:04:16.209 --> 01:04:18.500
network from data, you need
more than just a compendium

01:04:18.500 --> 01:04:19.500
of gene expression data.

01:04:19.500 --> 01:04:21.339
If you want to get the
directions correct,

01:04:21.339 --> 01:04:23.380
you need perturbations
where someone has actually

01:04:23.380 --> 01:04:26.502
inhibited particular
genes or proteins.

01:04:26.502 --> 01:04:28.210
Now, in a lot of these
Bayesian networks,

01:04:28.210 --> 01:04:29.130
we're not going
to try to include

01:04:29.130 --> 01:04:31.380
every possible gene and
every possible protein.

01:04:31.380 --> 01:04:33.380
Either because we don't
have measurements of it,

01:04:33.380 --> 01:04:34.940
or because we need
a compact network.

01:04:34.940 --> 01:04:36.356
So there will often
be cases where

01:04:36.356 --> 01:04:39.220
the true regulator
in some causal chain,

01:04:39.220 --> 01:04:41.700
is missing from our data.

01:04:41.700 --> 01:04:45.110
So imagine this is the true
causal chain-- x activates

01:04:45.110 --> 01:04:47.932
y, which then activates z and w.

01:04:47.932 --> 01:04:49.890
But either because we
don't have the data on y,

01:04:49.890 --> 01:04:52.390
or because we left it out to
make our models more compact,

01:04:52.390 --> 01:04:53.940
it's not in the model.

01:04:53.940 --> 01:04:57.810
We can still pick up the
relationships between x and z,

01:04:57.810 --> 01:04:58.699
and x and w.

01:04:58.699 --> 01:05:00.115
But the data will
be much noisier.

01:05:00.115 --> 01:05:03.720
Because we're missing
that information.

01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:05.360
In the conditional
probability tables,

01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:08.216
relating x to y, and then
y because it's too targets.

01:05:12.972 --> 01:05:15.180
So Bayesian networks, we've
already seen quite a lot.

01:05:15.180 --> 01:05:18.010
We now have some idea of how to
transfer them from one domain

01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:20.180
to the domain of
gene expression data.

01:05:20.180 --> 01:05:21.809
The next approach
we want to look at

01:05:21.809 --> 01:05:23.100
is a regression-based approach.

01:05:25.734 --> 01:05:27.150
So the regression-based
approaches

01:05:27.150 --> 01:05:30.430
are founded on a
simple idea, which

01:05:30.430 --> 01:05:32.200
is that the expression
gene is going

01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:34.330
to be some function
of the expression

01:05:34.330 --> 01:05:35.337
levels of the regulator.

01:05:35.337 --> 01:05:36.920
We're going to
actually try to come up

01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:39.020
with a formula that
relates the activity

01:05:39.020 --> 01:05:40.865
levels of the
transcription factors,

01:05:40.865 --> 01:05:43.620
and the activity
level of the target.

01:05:43.620 --> 01:05:45.390
In this cartoon, I've
got a gene that's

01:05:45.390 --> 01:05:47.090
on under one
condition, that's off

01:05:47.090 --> 01:05:48.470
under some other conditions.

01:05:48.470 --> 01:05:51.177
What transforms it
from being off to on,

01:05:51.177 --> 01:05:53.260
is the introduction of
more of these transcription

01:05:53.260 --> 01:05:55.850
factors, that are
binding to the promoter.

01:05:55.850 --> 01:05:57.740
So in general, I have
some predicted level

01:05:57.740 --> 01:05:59.075
of expression for the gene.

01:05:59.075 --> 01:06:01.370
It's called the
predicted level y.

01:06:01.370 --> 01:06:04.450
And it's some function,
unspecified at this point, f

01:06:04.450 --> 01:06:08.100
of g, of all the expression
levels of the transcription

01:06:08.100 --> 01:06:10.890
factors that regulate that gene.

01:06:10.890 --> 01:06:13.320
So just again,
nomenclature is straight,

01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:16.130
x sub g is going to be
the expression of gene x--

01:06:16.130 --> 01:06:19.710
I'm sorry, expression of gene g.

01:06:19.710 --> 01:06:23.450
This capital X, sub t of g
is the set of transcription

01:06:23.450 --> 01:06:27.660
factors, that I believe
are regulating that gene.

01:06:27.660 --> 01:06:29.390
And then f is an
arbitrary function.

01:06:29.390 --> 01:06:30.730
We're going to have
a noise term as well.

01:06:30.730 --> 01:06:32.604
Because this is the
observed gene expression,

01:06:32.604 --> 01:06:36.700
not some sort of platonic view
of the true gene expression.

01:06:36.700 --> 01:06:39.781
Now frequently, we'll
have a specific function.

01:06:39.781 --> 01:06:41.280
So the simplest one
you can imagine,

01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:42.730
which is a linear function.

01:06:42.730 --> 01:06:45.850
So the expression of
any particular gene

01:06:45.850 --> 01:06:48.850
is going to be a
linear function, a sum,

01:06:48.850 --> 01:06:51.490
of the expression of
all of it's regulators,

01:06:51.490 --> 01:06:54.820
where each one has associated
with it a coefficient beta.

01:06:54.820 --> 01:06:56.240
And that beta
coefficient tells us

01:06:56.240 --> 01:07:00.220
how much particular a
regulator influences that gene.

01:07:00.220 --> 01:07:03.250
So say, p53 might have
a very large value.

01:07:03.250 --> 01:07:05.100
Some other
transcriptional regulator

01:07:05.100 --> 01:07:06.940
might have a small
value, representing

01:07:06.940 --> 01:07:09.430
their relative influence.

01:07:09.430 --> 01:07:11.830
Now, I don't know the
beta values in advance.

01:07:11.830 --> 01:07:14.150
So that's one of the things
that I need to learn.

01:07:14.150 --> 01:07:17.756
So I want to be able to
find a setting that tells me

01:07:17.756 --> 01:07:20.130
what the beta values are for
every possible transcription

01:07:20.130 --> 01:07:21.060
factor.

01:07:21.060 --> 01:07:23.000
If the algorithm sets
the beta value to zero,

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:23.958
what does that tell me?

01:07:26.727 --> 01:07:28.143
If a beta value
is zero here, what

01:07:28.143 --> 01:07:31.620
does that tell me about that
transcriptional regulator?

01:07:31.620 --> 01:07:32.760
No influence, right.

01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:35.310
And the higher the value, then
the greater the influence.

01:07:35.310 --> 01:07:35.810
OK.

01:07:35.810 --> 01:07:38.090
So how do we discover these?

01:07:38.090 --> 01:07:39.540
So the tip of the
approach then is

01:07:39.540 --> 01:07:40.830
to come up with some
objective function

01:07:40.830 --> 01:07:42.330
that we're going
to try to optimize.

01:07:42.330 --> 01:07:44.070
And an obvious
objective function

01:07:44.070 --> 01:07:46.710
is the difference between
the observed expression

01:07:46.710 --> 01:07:49.150
value for each gene,
and the expected one,

01:07:49.150 --> 01:07:50.420
based on that linear function.

01:07:50.420 --> 01:07:52.600
And we're going to choose
a set of data parameters

01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:54.810
that minimize the difference
between the observed

01:07:54.810 --> 01:07:58.220
and the expected, minimize
the sum of the squares.

01:07:58.220 --> 01:08:00.680
So the residual sum
of the squares error,

01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:02.580
between the predicted
and the observed.

01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:08.140
So this is a relatively
standard regression problem,

01:08:08.140 --> 01:08:09.650
just in different setting.

01:08:09.650 --> 01:08:12.490
Now one of the problems with
a standard regression problem,

01:08:12.490 --> 01:08:14.330
is that we'll
typically get a lot

01:08:14.330 --> 01:08:15.850
of very small values of beta.

01:08:15.850 --> 01:08:17.950
So we won't get all
zeros or all ones,

01:08:17.950 --> 01:08:19.950
meaning the algorithm is
100% certain that these

01:08:19.950 --> 01:08:21.620
are the drivers
and these are not.

01:08:21.620 --> 01:08:25.609
We'll get a lot of small values
for many, many transcription

01:08:25.609 --> 01:08:26.760
factors.

01:08:26.760 --> 01:08:28.859
And OK, that could
represent the reality.

01:08:28.859 --> 01:08:30.700
But the bad thing is
that those data values

01:08:30.700 --> 01:08:32.009
are going to be unstable.

01:08:32.009 --> 01:08:33.550
So small changes in
the training data

01:08:33.550 --> 01:08:36.350
will give you big changes, in
which transcription factors

01:08:36.350 --> 01:08:37.479
have which values.

01:08:37.479 --> 01:08:39.069
So that not a desirable setting.

01:08:39.069 --> 01:08:40.902
There's a whole field
built up around trying

01:08:40.902 --> 01:08:43.399
to come up with
better solutions.

01:08:43.399 --> 01:08:45.685
I've given you some
references here.

01:08:45.685 --> 01:08:47.310
One of them is to a
paper that did well

01:08:47.310 --> 01:08:48.268
in the DREAM challenge.

01:08:48.268 --> 01:08:50.649
The other one is to
a very good textbook,

01:08:50.649 --> 01:08:52.180
Elements of
Statistical Learning.

01:08:52.180 --> 01:08:53.840
And there are various
techniques that

01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:56.760
allow you to try to
limit the number of betas

01:08:56.760 --> 01:08:59.660
that are non-zero.

01:08:59.660 --> 01:09:01.960
And by doing that, you get
more robust predictions.

01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:04.584
At a cost, right, because there
could be a lot of transcription

01:09:04.584 --> 01:09:07.490
factors that really do
have small influences.

01:09:07.490 --> 01:09:09.170
But we'll trade
that off, by getting

01:09:09.170 --> 01:09:11.003
more accurate predictions
from the ones that

01:09:11.003 --> 01:09:12.035
have the big influences.

01:09:16.787 --> 01:09:18.370
Are there any questions
on regression?

01:09:21.310 --> 01:09:24.330
So the last of the methods
that we're examining-- this

01:09:24.330 --> 01:09:25.620
is a mutual information.

01:09:25.620 --> 01:09:28.350
We've already seen mutual
information in the course.

01:09:28.350 --> 01:09:30.569
So information
content is related

01:09:30.569 --> 01:09:34.660
to the probability of observing
some variable in an alphabet.

01:09:34.660 --> 01:09:36.239
So in most languages,
the probability

01:09:36.239 --> 01:09:40.004
of observing letters
is quite variable.

01:09:40.004 --> 01:09:41.920
So Es are very common
in the English language.

01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:43.420
Other letters are less common.

01:09:43.420 --> 01:09:48.279
As anyone who plays Hangman or
watches Wheel of fortune knows.

01:09:48.279 --> 01:09:49.830
And we defined the
entropy as the sum

01:09:49.830 --> 01:09:52.460
over all possible outcomes.

01:09:52.460 --> 01:09:55.260
The probability of
observing some variable,

01:09:55.260 --> 01:09:57.580
and the information
on to that variable,

01:09:57.580 --> 01:10:01.410
we can define the discrete
case, or in the continuous case.

01:10:01.410 --> 01:10:03.530
And the critical
thing is to have

01:10:03.530 --> 01:10:05.346
mutual information
between two variables.

01:10:05.346 --> 01:10:07.970
So that's the difference between
the entropy of those variables

01:10:07.970 --> 01:10:10.930
independently, and
then the joint entropy.

01:10:10.930 --> 01:10:13.120
So things with a high
mutual information,

01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:16.580
means that one variable gives
the significant knowledge

01:10:16.580 --> 01:10:18.080
of what the other
variable is doing.

01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:19.830
It reduces my uncertainty.

01:10:19.830 --> 01:10:21.900
That's the critical idea.

01:10:21.900 --> 01:10:22.850
OK.

01:10:22.850 --> 01:10:25.105
So we looked at
correlation before.

01:10:25.105 --> 01:10:26.480
There could be
settings where you

01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:30.390
have very low correlation
between two variables,

01:10:30.390 --> 01:10:32.900
but have high
mutual information.

01:10:32.900 --> 01:10:38.730
So consider these two genes,
protein A and protein b,

01:10:38.730 --> 01:10:42.535
and the blue dots are the
relationship between them.

01:10:42.535 --> 01:10:44.410
You can see that there's
a lot of information

01:10:44.410 --> 01:10:46.900
content in these two variables.

01:10:46.900 --> 01:10:50.680
Knowing the value of A
gives me a high confidence

01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:53.560
in the value of B. But
there's no linear relationship

01:10:53.560 --> 01:10:55.800
that describes these.

01:10:55.800 --> 01:10:57.270
So if I use mutual
information, I

01:10:57.270 --> 01:10:58.875
can capture
situations like this,

01:10:58.875 --> 01:11:02.330
that I can't capture
with correlation.

01:11:02.330 --> 01:11:04.610
And these kinds of
situations actually occur.

01:11:04.610 --> 01:11:06.970
So for example in a
feed-forward loop--

01:11:06.970 --> 01:11:10.680
say we've got a regulator
A, and it directly

01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:15.860
activates B. It also directly
activates C. But C inhibits B.

01:11:15.860 --> 01:11:18.547
So you've got the path on
the left-hand sides that

01:11:18.547 --> 01:11:19.755
are pressing the accelerator.

01:11:19.755 --> 01:11:22.970
And the path on the right hand
side pressing the stop pedal.

01:11:22.970 --> 01:11:25.326
That's called an incoherent
feed-forward loop.

01:11:25.326 --> 01:11:27.700
And you can get under different
settings, different kinds

01:11:27.700 --> 01:11:30.985
of results, where this
is one of those examples.

01:11:30.985 --> 01:11:32.360
You can get much
more complicated

01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:34.990
behavior. [INAUDIBLE] are papers
that have really mapped out

01:11:34.990 --> 01:11:36.990
these behaviors across
many parameters settings.

01:11:36.990 --> 01:11:40.190
You can get switches
in the behavior.

01:11:40.190 --> 01:11:41.890
But in a lot of
these settings, you

01:11:41.890 --> 01:11:43.600
will have high
mutual information

01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:45.550
between two
variables, even if you

01:11:45.550 --> 01:11:48.880
don't have any correlation,
linear correlation

01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:49.762
between them.

01:11:53.122 --> 01:11:55.810
A well-publicized algorithm
that uses mutual information

01:11:55.810 --> 01:11:58.170
to infer gene regulatory
networks is called ARACNe.

01:12:01.249 --> 01:12:03.540
They go through and they
compute the mutual information

01:12:03.540 --> 01:12:07.300
between all pairs of
genes in their data set.

01:12:07.300 --> 01:12:10.330
And now one question you have
with mutual information is,

01:12:10.330 --> 01:12:14.057
what defines a significant
level of mutual information?

01:12:14.057 --> 01:12:16.140
So an obvious way to do
this, to try to figure out

01:12:16.140 --> 01:12:17.974
what's significant, is
to do randomizations.

01:12:17.974 --> 01:12:19.139
And so that's what they did.

01:12:19.139 --> 01:12:20.640
They shuffled the
expression data,

01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:22.780
to compute mutual information
among pairs of genes,

01:12:22.780 --> 01:12:23.870
where there isn't
actually a need--

01:12:23.870 --> 01:12:25.411
there shouldn't be
any relationships.

01:12:25.411 --> 01:12:27.555
Because the data
had been shuffled.

01:12:27.555 --> 01:12:30.180
And then you can decide whether
the observed mutual information

01:12:30.180 --> 01:12:31.940
is significantly
greater than when

01:12:31.940 --> 01:12:34.435
you get from the
randomized data.

01:12:34.435 --> 01:12:36.810
Now, the other thing that
happens with mutual information

01:12:36.810 --> 01:12:38.330
is that indirect
effects still apply

01:12:38.330 --> 01:12:40.140
to degrees of
mutual information.

01:12:40.140 --> 01:12:43.350
So let's consider the set of
genes that are shown on this.

01:12:43.350 --> 01:12:45.530
So you've got G2,
which is actually

01:12:45.530 --> 01:12:49.250
a regulator of G1 and G3.

01:12:49.250 --> 01:12:51.590
So G2 is going to have
high mutual information

01:12:51.590 --> 01:12:56.420
with G1, and with G3.

01:12:56.420 --> 01:12:59.430
Now, what's it going
to be about G1 and G3?

01:12:59.430 --> 01:13:01.610
They're going to behave
very similarly, as well.

01:13:01.610 --> 01:13:03.568
So it'll be a high degree
of mutual information

01:13:03.568 --> 01:13:06.630
between G1 and G3.

01:13:06.630 --> 01:13:08.670
So if I just rely on
mutual information,

01:13:08.670 --> 01:13:11.800
I can't tell what's a
regulator and what's

01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:14.314
a fellow at the same
level of regulation.

01:13:14.314 --> 01:13:16.480
They're both being affected
by something above them.

01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:18.470
I can't tell the difference
between those two.

01:13:18.470 --> 01:13:22.400
So they use what's called the
data processing inequality,

01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:25.730
where they say, well, these
regulatory interactions

01:13:25.730 --> 01:13:27.570
should have higher
mutual information,

01:13:27.570 --> 01:13:30.420
than this, which is just
between two common targets

01:13:30.420 --> 01:13:32.450
in the same parent.

01:13:32.450 --> 01:13:35.110
And so they drop from their
network, those things which

01:13:35.110 --> 01:13:38.116
are the lower of the
three in a triangle.

01:13:41.370 --> 01:13:43.120
So that was the original
ARACNe algorithm,

01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:44.670
and then they modified
it a little bit,

01:13:44.670 --> 01:13:47.086
to try to be more specific in
terms of the regulators that

01:13:47.086 --> 01:13:48.350
were being picked up.

01:13:48.350 --> 01:13:51.500
And so they called
this approach MINDy.

01:13:51.500 --> 01:13:55.055
And the core idea here,
is that in addition

01:13:55.055 --> 01:13:57.550
to the transcription
factors, you

01:13:57.550 --> 01:14:00.600
might have another protein that
turns a transcription factor on

01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:02.590
or off.

01:14:02.590 --> 01:14:04.440
So if I look over
different concentrations

01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:06.898
of the transcription factor,
different levels of expression

01:14:06.898 --> 01:14:09.410
between transcription
factors, I might

01:14:09.410 --> 01:14:12.410
find that there are some cases
where this other protein turns

01:14:12.410 --> 01:14:14.660
it on, and other cases
where it turns it off.

01:14:14.660 --> 01:14:19.532
So here, consider
these two data sets.

01:14:19.532 --> 01:14:20.990
Looking at different
concentrations

01:14:20.990 --> 01:14:22.900
of particular transcription
factor and different expression

01:14:22.900 --> 01:14:25.080
levels, and in one
case-- the blue ones,

01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:27.562
the modulator isn't
present at all,

01:14:27.562 --> 01:14:29.270
or present at it's
lowest possible level.

01:14:29.270 --> 01:14:32.200
And in the red case, it's
present as a high level.

01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:34.520
And you can see that when
the modulator is present only

01:14:34.520 --> 01:14:37.250
in low levels, there's no
relationship between a target

01:14:37.250 --> 01:14:38.809
and it's transcription factor.

01:14:38.809 --> 01:14:40.850
Or when the modulator is
present at a high level,

01:14:40.850 --> 01:14:42.650
then there's this
linear response

01:14:42.650 --> 01:14:44.920
of the target to it's
transcription factor.

01:14:44.920 --> 01:14:47.300
So this modulator seems to
be a necessary component.

01:14:47.300 --> 01:14:48.820
So they went through and
defined a whole bunch

01:14:48.820 --> 01:14:49.736
of settings like this.

01:14:49.736 --> 01:14:53.990
And then systematically search
the data for these modulators.

01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:56.360
So they started off with the
expression data set, genes

01:14:56.360 --> 01:14:59.080
in rows, experiments in columns.

01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:01.710
They do a set of
filtering to remove things

01:15:01.710 --> 01:15:06.120
that are going to be
problematic for the analysis.

01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:07.620
They look, for
example, for settings

01:15:07.620 --> 01:15:10.220
where you have-- they had to
start with a list of modulators

01:15:10.220 --> 01:15:12.303
and transcription factors,
and they moved the ones

01:15:12.303 --> 01:15:15.570
where there isn't enough
variation, and so on.

01:15:15.570 --> 01:15:18.550
And then they examine, for every
modulator and transcription

01:15:18.550 --> 01:15:22.656
factor pair, cases
where the modulator is

01:15:22.656 --> 01:15:24.280
present at its highest
level, and where

01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:26.280
it's present at
it's lowest level.

01:15:26.280 --> 01:15:29.514
So when the modulator is present
at a high level-- let's say,

01:15:29.514 --> 01:15:31.430
when the modulator is
present at a high level,

01:15:31.430 --> 01:15:32.805
there's a high
mutual information

01:15:32.805 --> 01:15:35.140
between the transcription
factor and the target.

01:15:35.140 --> 01:15:38.330
When the modulator is absent,
there's no mutual information.

01:15:38.330 --> 01:15:40.380
That's a setting we
looked at before.

01:15:40.380 --> 01:15:43.200
That would suggest that the
modulator is an activator.

01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:45.310
It's a positive modulator.

01:15:45.310 --> 01:15:46.890
You can have the
opposite situation,

01:15:46.890 --> 01:15:48.870
where when the modulator
is present at low levels,

01:15:48.870 --> 01:15:51.245
there's mutual information
between a transcription factor

01:15:51.245 --> 01:15:52.104
and it's target.

01:15:52.104 --> 01:15:54.020
When the modulator is
present at a high level,

01:15:54.020 --> 01:15:55.120
you don't see anything.

01:15:55.120 --> 01:15:56.661
That would suggest
that the modulator

01:15:56.661 --> 01:15:57.740
is a negative regulator.

01:15:57.740 --> 01:15:59.781
And then there are scenarios
where there's either

01:15:59.781 --> 01:16:01.210
uniformly high
information content

01:16:01.210 --> 01:16:04.640
between transcription factor
target, or uniformly low.

01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:07.000
So the modulator doesn't
seem to be doing anything.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.949
So we break it down
into these categories.

01:16:09.949 --> 01:16:11.990
And you can look at all
the different categories,

01:16:11.990 --> 01:16:14.040
in their supplemental tables.

01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:15.540
One thing that's
kind of interesting

01:16:15.540 --> 01:16:19.090
is they assume that regardless
of how high the transcription

01:16:19.090 --> 01:16:21.470
factor goes, you'll
always see an increase

01:16:21.470 --> 01:16:23.802
in the expression of the target.

01:16:23.802 --> 01:16:25.260
So there is no
saturation, which is

01:16:25.260 --> 01:16:30.240
an unnatural assumption
in these data sets.

01:16:30.240 --> 01:16:30.980
OK.

01:16:30.980 --> 01:16:33.932
So I think I'll close with this
example, from their experiment.

01:16:33.932 --> 01:16:35.390
And then in the
next lecture, we'll

01:16:35.390 --> 01:16:37.640
look at how these
different methods fare

01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:39.970
against each other in
the DREAM challenge.

01:16:39.970 --> 01:16:43.400
So they specifically wanted
to find regulators of MYC.

01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:48.460
So here's data for a
particular regulator, SDK 38.

01:16:48.460 --> 01:16:51.050
Here's the set of
expression of tumors

01:16:51.050 --> 01:16:53.620
where SDK 38
expression is lowest.

01:16:53.620 --> 01:16:57.330
And a set of tumors where
SDK 38 expression is highest.

01:16:57.330 --> 01:16:59.940
And they're sorted by the
expression level of MYC.

01:16:59.940 --> 01:17:01.440
So on the left hand
side, you'll see

01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:02.856
there's no particular
relationship

01:17:02.856 --> 01:17:05.902
between the expression level
of MYC and the targets.

01:17:05.902 --> 01:17:07.860
In the right hand side,
there is a relationship

01:17:07.860 --> 01:17:09.900
between the expression
level of MYC and targets.

01:17:09.900 --> 01:17:12.740
So having, apparently--
at least at this level

01:17:12.740 --> 01:17:16.810
of mutual information, having
higher levels of SDK 38,

01:17:16.810 --> 01:17:18.422
cause a relationship to occur.

01:17:18.422 --> 01:17:20.005
That would be example
of an activator.

01:17:22.310 --> 01:17:22.810
OK.

01:17:22.810 --> 01:17:24.560
So this technique has
a lot of advantages,

01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:27.110
and allows you to search rapidly
over very large data sets,

01:17:27.110 --> 01:17:29.800
to find potential target
transcription factor

01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:32.330
relationships, and also
potential modulators.

01:17:32.330 --> 01:17:33.835
It has some limitations.

01:17:33.835 --> 01:17:35.834
Where the key limitations
is that the signal has

01:17:35.834 --> 01:17:38.320
to be present in the
expression data set.

01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:40.060
So in the case of
a protein like p53,

01:17:40.060 --> 01:17:42.690
where we know it's activated
by all sort of other processes,

01:17:42.690 --> 01:17:45.350
phosphorylation or NF-kappaB,
where it's regulated

01:17:45.350 --> 01:17:48.490
by phosphorylation, you
might not get any signal.

01:17:48.490 --> 01:17:50.720
So there has to be a case
where the transcription

01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:52.630
factor itself, is
changing expression.

01:17:52.630 --> 01:17:54.710
It also won't work if
the modulator is always

01:17:54.710 --> 01:17:56.690
highly correlated
with its target,

01:17:56.690 --> 01:17:58.280
for some other
biological reason.

01:17:58.280 --> 01:18:00.870
So the modulator has to be
on, for other reasons, when

01:18:00.870 --> 01:18:02.330
the target is, then
you'll never be

01:18:02.330 --> 01:18:06.070
able to divide the
data in this way.

01:18:06.070 --> 01:18:07.730
One of the other
things I think that is

01:18:07.730 --> 01:18:08.782
problematic with
these networks is

01:18:08.782 --> 01:18:10.240
that you get such
large networks,

01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:11.698
and they're very
hard to interpret.

01:18:11.698 --> 01:18:13.950
So in this case, this
is the nearest neighbors

01:18:13.950 --> 01:18:16.650
of just one node in ARACNe.

01:18:16.650 --> 01:18:20.910
This is the mutual information
network of microRNA modulators

01:18:20.910 --> 01:18:24.330
that has a quarter of
a million interactions.

01:18:24.330 --> 01:18:26.690
And in these data
sets, often you

01:18:26.690 --> 01:18:28.850
end up selecting a very,
very large fraction

01:18:28.850 --> 01:18:30.430
of all the potential modulators.

01:18:30.430 --> 01:18:32.702
So of all the candidate
transcription factors

01:18:32.702 --> 01:18:34.410
in modulators, it
comes up with an answer

01:18:34.410 --> 01:18:36.510
that's roughly 10% to 20%
of them are regulating

01:18:36.510 --> 01:18:39.460
any particular gene,
which seems awfully high.

01:18:39.460 --> 01:18:40.080
OK.

01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:44.980
So any questions on the
methods we've seen so far?

01:18:44.980 --> 01:18:45.480
OK.

01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:47.026
So when we come
back on Thursday,

01:18:47.026 --> 01:18:48.400
we'll take a look
at head to head

01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:51.610
of how these different methods
perform on both the synthetic

01:18:51.610 --> 01:18:53.800
and the real data sets.
