00:00:25.625 --> 00:00:26.500
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.460
So today, we're going
to briefly review

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.750
classical sequencing and
next-gen or second-gen

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.520
sequencing, which sort of
provides a lot of the data

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:42.660
that the analytical methods
we'll be talking about work on.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.600
And we'll then introduce
local alignment

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.350
a la BLAST and some of
the statistics associated

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:52.830
with that.

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.680
So just a few brief
items on topic one.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:57.230
All right.

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.830
So today, we're going to
talk about sequencing first.

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.350
Conventional-- or Sanger
sequencing-- then next-gen

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.020
or second-gen
sequencing briefly.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.280
And then talk about
local alignments.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.540
So background for the sequencing
part, the Metzger review

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.410
covers everything you'll need.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.180
And for the alignment-- we'll
talk about local alignment

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.110
today, global
alignment on Tuesday--

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.310
then chapters four and five of
the text cover it pretty well.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:28.590
So here's the text.

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.090
If you haven't decided
whether to get it or not,

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.050
I'll have it up here.

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.650
You can come flip
through it after class.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.450
Sequencing is mostly
done at the level of DNA.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:50.202
Whether the original
material was RNA or not,

00:01:50.202 --> 00:01:52.410
usually convert to DNA and
sequence at the DNA level.

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:57.142
So we'll often think about
DNA as sort of a string.

00:01:57.142 --> 00:01:59.100
But it's important to
remember that it actually

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.230
has a three dimensional
structure as shown here.

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.210
And often, it's helpful to
think of it in sort of a two

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:09.710
dimensional
representation where you

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:14.170
think about the bases and
their hydrogen bonding

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.320
and so forth as
shown in the middle.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.530
My mouse is not working
today for some reason,

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.410
but hopefully, we won't need it.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.400
So the chemistry of sequencing
is very closely related

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.970
to the chemistry of
the individual bases.

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.900
And there are really
three main types

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.390
that are going to
be relevant here.

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.170
Ribonucleotides,
deoxyribonucleotides,

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.370
then for Sanger sequencing,
dideoxyribonucleotides.

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.200
So who can tell me which
of these structures

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.860
corresponds to which
of those names?

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.160
And also, please let
me know your name

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.860
and I'll attempt
to remember some

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.580
of your names toward the end
of the semester probably.

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.770
So, which are which?

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:11.386
Yes, what's your name?

00:03:11.386 --> 00:03:12.814
AUDIENCE: I'm Simona.

00:03:12.814 --> 00:03:15.947
So the ribonucleotide
is the top right.

00:03:15.947 --> 00:03:18.566
The deoxy is the one below it.

00:03:18.566 --> 00:03:20.190
And the dideoxy is
the one to the left.

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.820
PROFESSOR: OK, so
that is correct.

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.660
So one way to keep
these things in mind

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.230
is the numbering of the bases.

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.950
So the carbons in the ribo
sugar are numbered one,

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.260
so carbon 1 is the one
where the base is attached.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.560
Two is here, which has an OH
in RNA and just an H in DNA.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.720
And then three is
very important.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.650
Four, and then five.

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.700
So five connects
to the phosphates,

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.941
which then will connect the
base to the sugar phosphate

00:03:52.941 --> 00:03:53.440
backbone.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.720
And three is where you extend.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.480
That's where you're going to
add the next base in a growing

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:01.980
chain.

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:08.810
And so what will happen if you
give DNA polymerase a template

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.185
and some dideoxy nucleotides?

00:04:14.955 --> 00:04:17.329
It won't be able to extend
because there's no 3-prime OH.

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:19.030
And all the chemistry
requires the OH.

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.770
And so that's the basis
of classical or Sanger

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.770
sequencing, which Fred
Sanger got the Nobel

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.400
Prize for in the 1980s-- I think
it was developed in the '70s--

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.940
and it's really
the basis of most

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.190
of the sequencing, or
pretty much all the DNA

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.860
sequencing up until
the early 2000s

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.450
before some newer
technologies came about.

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:45.110
And it takes advantage
of this special property

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:51.860
of dideoxy nucleotides that they
terminate the growing chain.

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.980
So imagine we have
a template DNA.

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.540
So this is the
molecule whose sequence

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:59.290
we want to determine
shown there in black.

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:00.750
We then have a primer.

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.470
And notice the primer's
written in 5-prime to 3-prime

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:04.240
direction.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:09.360
The ends would be
primer sequences

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.829
and then primer complimentary
sequences in the template.

00:05:11.829 --> 00:05:13.870
So you typically will have
your template cloned--

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:15.661
this is in conventional
sequencing-- cloned

00:05:15.661 --> 00:05:19.470
into some vector
like a phage vector

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.080
for sequencing so you know
the flanking sequences.

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.450
And then you do four
sequencing reactions

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.070
in conventional
Sanger sequencing.

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:31.540
And I know some of you have
probably had this before.

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.620
So let's take the first
chemical reaction.

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.340
The one here with a DDGTP.

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.527
So what would you
put in that reaction?

00:05:41.527 --> 00:05:43.360
What are all the
components of that reaction

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.590
if you wanted to do
conventional sequencing

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:49.316
on, say, an acrylonitrile?

00:05:49.316 --> 00:05:51.760
Anyone?

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:55.090
What do you need and
what does it accomplish?

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:56.416
Yeah, what's your name?

00:05:56.416 --> 00:05:57.412
AUDIENCE: I'm Tim.

00:05:57.412 --> 00:05:57.660
PROFESSOR: Tim?

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:58.306
Oh yeah, I know you, Tim.

00:05:58.306 --> 00:05:58.906
OK, go ahead.

00:05:58.906 --> 00:06:02.890
AUDIENCE: So you need
the four nucleotides--

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:04.384
the deoxynucleotides.

00:06:04.384 --> 00:06:08.368
You will need the
dideoxy P nucleotides.

00:06:08.368 --> 00:06:11.356
In addition, you need all
the other [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:11.356 --> 00:06:12.352
You need polymerase.

00:06:12.352 --> 00:06:17.830
Generally, you need a buffer
of some sort, [INAUDIBLE],

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:20.654
to [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:20.654 --> 00:06:22.070
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
primary template.

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.570
Yeah.

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:24.470
Great.

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:24.970
That's good.

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:28.090
It sounds like Tim could
actually do this experiment.

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:35.747
And what ratio would you put in?

00:06:35.747 --> 00:06:37.330
So you said you're
going to put in all

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:40.660
four conventional
deoxynucleotides and then one

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:41.770
dideoxynucleotide.

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:46.120
So let's say dideoxy G
just for simplicity here.

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:49.740
So in what ratio would you
put the dideoxynucleotide

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:51.539
compared to the
conventional nucleotides?

00:06:51.539 --> 00:06:53.080
AUDIENCE: To lower
the concentration.

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:53.788
PROFESSOR: Lower?

00:06:53.788 --> 00:06:55.764
Like how much lower?

00:06:55.764 --> 00:06:56.930
AUDIENCE: Like, a lot lower.

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:58.595
PROFESSOR: Like maybe 1%?

00:06:58.595 --> 00:06:59.220
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:00.511
PROFESSOR: Something like that.

00:07:00.511 --> 00:07:01.900
You want to put it a lot lower.

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:05.858
And why is that so important?

00:07:05.858 --> 00:07:11.325
AUDIENCE: Because you want the
thing to be able to progress.

00:07:11.325 --> 00:07:15.052
Because you need enough of the
ribonucleotide concentration so

00:07:15.052 --> 00:07:19.277
that [INAUDIBLE]
every [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:19.277 --> 00:07:23.982
equivalent or excess and you're
going to terminate [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:23.982 --> 00:07:24.690
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:29.440
So if you put equamolar
deoxy G and dideoxy G,

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:32.050
then it's going to be a
50% chance of terminating

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:33.810
every time you hit
a C in the template.

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:35.480
So you're going to
have half as much

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:38.010
of the material at the second
G, and a quarter as much as

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:41.120
the third, and you're going to
have vanishingly small amounts.

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:42.911
So you're only going
to be able to sequence

00:07:42.911 --> 00:07:45.790
the first few C's
in the template.

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:46.290
Exactly.

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:47.456
So that's a very good point.

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:53.520
So now let's imagine you do
these four separate reactions.

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:55.950
You typically would
have radiolabeled primer

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:57.520
so you can see your DNA.

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.430
And then you would run
it on some sort of gel.

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:03.670
This is obviously not a real
gel, but an idealized version.

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:10.260
And then in the lane
where you put dideoxy G,

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.160
you would see the
smallest products.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.900
So you read these guys
from the bottom up.

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:18.580
And in this lane there
is a very small product

00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:21.896
that's just one base longer
than the primer here.

00:08:21.896 --> 00:08:24.520
And that's because there was a
C there and it terminated there.

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:27.820
And then the next C appears
several bases later.

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:30.010
So you have sort of a gap here.

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:33.330
And so you can see that the
first base in the template

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:35.929
would be a complement
of T, or C.

00:08:35.929 --> 00:08:44.400
And the second base
would be, you can see,

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:46.749
the next smallest product
in this dideoxy T lane,

00:08:46.749 --> 00:08:48.290
therefore it would
be A. And you just

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:50.970
sort of snake your
way up through the gel

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:52.540
and read out the sequence.

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:54.760
And this works well.

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:58.200
So what does it actually
look like in practice?

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.440
Here are some actual
sequencing gels.

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:03.390
So you run four lanes.

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:10.540
And on big polyacrylamide
gels like this.

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:12.237
Torbin, you ever
run one of these?

00:09:12.237 --> 00:09:12.820
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:14.080
PROFESSOR: Yes?

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:17.140
They're a big pain to cast.

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:19.090
Run for several hours, I think.

00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:22.360
And you get these
banding patterns.

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:27.080
And what limits the
sequence read length?

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:31.310
So we normally call
the sequence generated

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:34.560
from one run of a
sequencer as a read.

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:38.640
So that one attempt to sequence
the template is called a read.

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:40.530
And you can see
it's relatively easy

00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:42.710
to read the sequence
toward the bottom,

00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:46.060
and then it gets
harder as you go up.

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:49.510
And so that's really what
fundamentally limits the read

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:53.170
length, is that the bands get
closer and closer together.

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:58.210
So they'll run inversely
proportional to size

00:09:58.210 --> 00:10:00.360
with the small ones
running faster.

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:05.170
But then the difference between
a 20 base product and a 21

00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:06.050
might be significant.

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:09.670
But the difference between a
500 base product and a 501 base

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:11.450
product is going
to be very small.

00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:16.430
And so you basically can't
order the lanes anymore.

00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:19.330
And therefore, that's sort of
what fundamentally limits it.

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:20.780
All right.

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:24.410
So here we had to run
four lanes of a gel.

00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:26.190
Can anyone think of
a more efficient way

00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:29.107
of doing Sanger sequencing?

00:10:29.107 --> 00:10:30.690
Is there any way to
do it in one lane?

00:10:34.468 --> 00:10:35.426
Yeah, what's your name?

00:10:35.426 --> 00:10:36.338
AUDIENCE: Adrian.

00:10:36.338 --> 00:10:39.812
You can use four different
types of the entities.

00:10:39.812 --> 00:10:41.590
Maybe like four
different colors.

00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:42.310
AUDIENCE: Four different colors.

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:44.670
OK, so instead of using radio
labeling on the primary,

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:50.400
you use fluorophore on your
dideoxy entities, for example.

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:53.980
And then you can run them.

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:57.170
Depending where that
strand terminated,

00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:58.680
it'll be a different color.

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:00.221
And you can run them
all in one lane.

00:11:00.221 --> 00:11:02.150
OK, so that looks like that.

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:04.990
And so this was an
important development

00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:08.610
called terminator
sequencing in the '90s.

00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:14.940
That was the basis of the ABI
3700 machine, which was really

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:18.200
the workhorse of
genome sequencing

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:19.910
in the late '90s
and early 2000s.

00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:22.430
Really what enabled the
human genome to be sequenced.

00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:25.960
And so one of the other
innovations in this technology

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:31.034
was that instead of having a
big gel, they shrunk the gel.

00:11:31.034 --> 00:11:32.950
And then they just had
a reader at the bottom.

00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:38.475
So the gel was shrunk to as thin
as these little capillaries.

00:11:38.475 --> 00:11:40.100
I don't know if you
can see these guys.

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:43.500
But basically it's like
a little thread here.

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:46.040
And so each one of these
is effectively-- oops!

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:47.320
Oh no.

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:50.140
No worries, this
is not valuable.

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:54.450
Ancient technology that I
got for free from somebody.

00:11:54.450 --> 00:12:00.702
So the DNA would be
loaded at the top.

00:12:00.702 --> 00:12:02.160
There would be a
little gel in each

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:04.520
of these-- it's called
capillary sequencing.

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:06.060
And then it would
run out the bottom

00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:07.570
and there would be
a detector which

00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:09.240
would detect the
four different flours

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:10.740
and read out the sequence.

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:17.010
So this basically condensed the
volume needed for sequencing.

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:23.630
Any questions about
conventional sequencing?

00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:24.130
Yes?

00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:26.378
AUDIENCE: Where
are the [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:26.378 --> 00:12:28.738
where you'd put the
fluorescent flags?

00:12:28.738 --> 00:12:31.294
Like the topic from
the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:12:31.294 --> 00:12:32.960
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
that's a good question.

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:35.390
I don't actually remember.

00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:39.480
I think there are different
options available.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:41.460
And sometimes with some
of these reactions,

00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:45.940
you need to use modified
polymerases that

00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:48.250
can tolerate these
modified nucleotides.

00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:49.923
Yeah, so I don't remember that.

00:12:49.923 --> 00:12:51.120
It's a good question.

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:52.690
I can look that up.

00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:56.650
So how long can a
conventional sequencer go?

00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:57.920
What's the read length?

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:01.030
Anyone know?

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:04.060
It's about, say, 600 or so.

00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:07.220
And so that's reasonably long.

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:11.360
How long is a typical
mammalian mRNA?

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:12.730
Maybe two, three kb?

00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:16.090
So you have in a typical
exon, maybe 150 bases or so.

00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:17.920
So you have a chunk.

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:19.680
You don't generally
get full length cDNA.

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:22.540
But you get a chunk
of a cDNA that's say,

00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:25.200
three, four exons in length.

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:28.340
And that is actually
generally sufficient

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:32.660
to uniquely identify the gene
locus that that read came from.

00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:35.130
And so that was the
basis of EST sequencing--

00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:38.060
so-called Expressed
Sequence Tag sequencing.

00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:43.510
And millions of these 600 base
chunks of cDNA were generated

00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:48.891
and they have been quite
useful over the years.

00:13:48.891 --> 00:13:49.390
All right.

00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:51.210
So what is next-gen sequencing?

00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:58.980
So in next-gen sequencing, you
only read one base at a time.

00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:04.370
So it's often a
little bit slower.

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:06.260
But it's really
massively parallel.

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.430
And that's the big advantage.

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:12.000
And it's orders of
magnitude cheaper

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.139
per base than
conventional sequencing.

00:14:14.139 --> 00:14:15.555
Like when it first
came out it, it

00:14:15.555 --> 00:14:17.360
was maybe two orders
of magnitude cheaper.

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:21.480
And now it's probably another
four orders of magnitude.

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:24.910
So it really blows away
conventional sequencing

00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:30.600
if the output that
you care about

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:34.960
is mostly proportional to
number of bases sequence.

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:37.910
If the output is proportional
to the quality of the assembly

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:39.740
or something, then
there are applications

00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:42.430
where conventional
sequencing still

00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:45.547
is very useful Because the
next-gen sequencing tends

00:14:45.547 --> 00:14:46.130
to be shorter.

00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:51.870
But in terms of just volume, it
generates much, much more bases

00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:53.390
in one reaction.

00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:58.700
And so the basic ideas are
that you have your template DNA

00:14:58.700 --> 00:14:59.670
molecules.

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:04.960
Now typically, tens of thousands
for technologies like PacBio

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:10.560
or hundreds of millions for
technologies like Illumina that

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:14.890
are immobilized on
some sort of surface--

00:15:14.890 --> 00:15:17.960
typically a flow
cell-- and there

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:19.690
are either single
molecule methods

00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:21.731
where you have a single
molecule of your template

00:15:21.731 --> 00:15:24.950
or there are methods that
locally amplify your template

00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:28.290
and produce, say, hundreds
of identical copies

00:15:28.290 --> 00:15:29.440
in little clusters.

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:32.400
And then you use
modified nucleotides,

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:34.440
often with
fluorophores attached,

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:41.990
to interrogate the next base at
each of your template molecules

00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:44.800
for hundreds and hundreds
of millions of them.

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:46.800
And so there are several
different technologies.

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:48.133
We won't talk about all of them.

00:15:48.133 --> 00:15:49.640
We'll just talk
about two or three

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:52.430
that are interesting
and widely used.

00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:55.170
And they differ depending
on the DNA template, what

00:15:55.170 --> 00:15:57.100
types of modified
nucleotides are used,

00:15:57.100 --> 00:16:00.210
and to some extent, in the
imaging and the image analysis,

00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:03.460
which differs for single
molecule methods, for example,

00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:08.770
compared to the ones
that sequence a cluster.

00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:12.150
So there's a table in
the Metzger review.

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:15.970
And so I've just told you
that next-gen sequencing

00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:16.610
is so cheap.

00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:18.980
But then you see how
much these machines cost

00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:21.790
and you could buy lots of
other interesting things

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:24.670
with that kind of money.

00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:27.330
And I also want to emphasize
that that's not even

00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:28.060
the full cost.

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:33.100
So if you were to buy an
Illumina GA2-- this would

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:35.010
be like a couple years
ago when the GA2 was

00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:38.580
the state of the art-- for
half a million dollars,

00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:41.070
the reagents to run
that thing, if you're

00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:43.420
going to run it continuously
throughout the year,

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:47.120
the reagents to run it
would be over a million.

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:50.470
So this actually
underestimates the cost.

00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:54.170
However, the cost per
base is super, super low.

00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:58.830
Because they generate
so much data at once.

00:16:58.830 --> 00:17:01.410
All right, So we'll talk
about a couple of these.

00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:04.010
The first next-gen
sequencing technology

00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:08.050
to be published and
still used today

00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:13.869
was from 454--
now Roche-- and it

00:17:13.869 --> 00:17:16.979
was based on what's
called emulsion PCR.

00:17:16.979 --> 00:17:19.020
So they have these little
beads, the little beads

00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:23.589
have adapter DNA molecules
covalently attached.

00:17:23.589 --> 00:17:29.020
You incubate the beads
with DNA, and you actually

00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:29.760
make an emulsion.

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:31.740
So it's an oil water emulsion.

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:34.780
So each bead, which
is hydrophilic,

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:38.040
is in the little bubble
of water inside oil.

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:41.030
And the reason for that
is so that you do it

00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:42.520
at a template
concentration that's

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:44.950
low enough that only a
single molecule of template

00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:46.630
is associated with each bead.

00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:49.570
So the oil then
provides a barrier

00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:53.701
so that the DNA can't get
transferred from one bead

00:17:53.701 --> 00:17:54.200
to another.

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:57.010
So each bead will have a
unique template molecule.

00:17:57.010 --> 00:18:00.300
You do sort of a local
PCR-like reaction

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:05.110
to amplify that DNA
molecule on the bead,

00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:10.732
and then you do sequencing
one base at a time using

00:18:10.732 --> 00:18:12.190
a luciferase based
method that I'll

00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:14.400
show you on the next slide.

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:18.410
So Illumina technology differs
in that instead of an emulsion,

00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:20.730
you're doing it on the
surface of a flow cell.

00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:24.450
Again, you start with a
single molecule of template.

00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:26.000
Your flow cell has
these two types

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.610
of adapters covalently attached.

00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:33.080
The template anneals to
one of these adapters.

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:38.180
You extend the adapter molecule
with dNTPs and polymerase.

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:42.620
Now you have the complement of
your template, your denature.

00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:44.340
Now you have the
inverse complement

00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:46.580
of your template
molecule covalently

00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:48.054
attached to the cell surface.

00:18:48.054 --> 00:18:50.220
And then at the other end
there's the other adapter.

00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:51.636
And so what you
could do is what's

00:18:51.636 --> 00:18:56.140
called bridge amplification
where that now complement

00:18:56.140 --> 00:19:00.060
of the template molecule
will bridge over

00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:02.300
hybridized to the other
adapter, and then you

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:03.870
can extend that adapter.

00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:06.336
And now you've regenerated
your original template.

00:19:06.336 --> 00:19:08.210
And so now you have the
complementary strand,

00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:10.280
and the original
strand, your denature.

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:14.140
And then each of those molecules
can undergo subsequent rounds

00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:18.390
of bridge amplification to
make clusters of typically

00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:22.197
several hundred
thousand molecules.

00:19:22.197 --> 00:19:22.780
Is that clear?

00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:23.280
Question.

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:24.486
Yeah, what's your name?

00:19:24.486 --> 00:19:26.458
AUDIENCE: Stephanie.

00:19:26.458 --> 00:19:30.737
How do they get the adapters
onto the template molecules?

00:19:30.737 --> 00:19:32.320
PROFESSOR: How do
you get the adapters

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:34.520
onto the template molecules?

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:38.280
So that's typically
by DNA ligation.

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:43.130
So we may cover
that in later steps.

00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:43.856
It depends.

00:19:43.856 --> 00:19:45.230
There's a few
different protocol.

00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:47.480
So for example, if you're
sequencing microRNAs,

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:50.370
you typically would
isolate the small RNAs

00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:52.850
and use RNA litigation
to get the adapters on.

00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:55.770
And then you would do
an RT step to get DNA.

00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:59.400
With most other applications
like RNA-seq or genome

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:02.950
sequencing-- so with RNA-seq,
you're starting from mRNA,

00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:06.850
you typically will isolate
total RNA, do poly(A) selection,

00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:08.740
you fragment your RNA
to reduce the effects

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:11.450
of secondary structure,
you random prime with,

00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:13.690
like, random hexamers RT enzyme.

00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:18.550
So that'll make little bits
of cDNA 200 bases long.

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:20.200
You use second strand synthesis.

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:23.730
Now you have double
stranded cDNA fragments.

00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:28.310
And then you do, like, blunt end
ligation to add the adapters.

00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:31.086
And then you denature so
you have single strand.

00:20:31.086 --> 00:20:32.946
AUDIENCE: I guess my
question is how do you

00:20:32.946 --> 00:20:35.550
make sure that the two
ends sandwiching the DNA

00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:38.540
are different as opposed to--

00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:40.570
PROFESSOR: That the
two ends are different.

00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:43.670
Yeah, that's a good question.

00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:51.260
I'll post some stuff about--
It's a good question.

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:53.210
I don't want to sweep
it under the rug.

00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:55.600
But I kind of want to move on.

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:59.500
And I'll post a
little bit about that.

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:03.880
All right so we
did 454 Illumina.

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:06.050
Helicos is sort of like
Illumina sequencing

00:21:06.050 --> 00:21:08.360
except single molecule.

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:11.670
So you have your
template covalently

00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:13.560
attached to your substrate.

00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:18.590
You just anneal primer and
just start sequencing it

00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:24.680
And there's major pros and cons
of single molecule sequencing,

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:26.080
which we can talk about.

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:29.770
And then the PacBio
technology is fundamentally

00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:33.980
different in that the
template is not actually

00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:35.890
covalently attached
to the surface.

00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:38.960
The DNA polymerase is covalently
attached to the surface

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:43.260
and the template is sort of
threaded into the polymerase.

00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:46.350
And this is a phage polymerase
that's highly processive

00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:47.940
and strand displacing.

00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:50.640
And the template is often
a circular molecule.

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:54.060
And so you can
actually read around

00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:56.480
the template multiple
times, which turns out

00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:59.795
to be really useful in PacBio
because the error rate is

00:21:59.795 --> 00:22:01.850
quite high for the sequencing.

00:22:01.850 --> 00:22:05.530
So in the top, in
the 454, you're

00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:08.040
measuring luciferase
activity-- light.

00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:09.924
In Illumina, you're
measuring fluorescence.

00:22:09.924 --> 00:22:11.590
Four different
fluorescent tags, sort of

00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:15.030
like the four different tags
we saw in Sanger sequencing.

00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:18.520
Helicose, it's single
tag one base at a time.

00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:21.350
And in PacBio, you actually
have a fluorescently

00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:26.620
labeled dNTP that has
the label on-- it's

00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:28.520
actually
hexaphosphate-- it's got

00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:31.020
the label on the
sixth phosphate.

00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:33.530
So the dNTP is labeled.

00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:36.560
It enters the active site
of the DNA polymerase.

00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:38.530
And the residence
time is much longer

00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:41.600
if the base is actually
going to get incorporated

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:42.900
into that growing chain.

00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:46.960
And so you measure how much time
you have a fluorescent signal.

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:48.830
And if it's long, that
means that that base

00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:51.360
must have incorporated
into the DNA.

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:56.450
But then, the extension
reaction itself

00:22:56.450 --> 00:22:58.390
will cleave off the
last five phosphates

00:22:58.390 --> 00:23:00.640
and the fluorophore tag.

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:03.960
And so you'll
regenerate native DNA.

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:05.390
So that's another difference.

00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:07.315
Whereas in Illumina
sequencing, as we'll see,

00:23:07.315 --> 00:23:09.190
there's this reversible
terminator chemistry.

00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:12.330
So the DNA is not native
that you're synthesizing.

00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:17.800
So this is just a
little bit more on 454.

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:19.300
Just some pretty pictures.

00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:22.030
I think I described that before.

00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:30.080
The key chemistry here is that
you add one dNTP at a time.

00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:33.060
So only a subset of the wells--
perhaps a quarter of them--

00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:36.740
that have that next base,
the complementary base

00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:40.020
free-- as the next
one after the primer--

00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:42.710
will undergo synthesis.

00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:45.920
And when they undergo synthesis,
you release pyrophosphate.

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:48.580
And they have these
enzymes attached

00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:51.410
to these little micro beads--
the orange beads-- sulfurylase

00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:54.680
and luciferase, that use
pyrophosphate to basically

00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:55.650
generate light.

00:23:55.650 --> 00:23:58.760
And so then you have one of
these beads in each well.

00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:04.600
You look at which wells
lit up when we added dCTP.

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:08.030
And they must have had G as
the next base and so forth.

00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:10.019
And there's no termination here.

00:24:10.019 --> 00:24:11.810
The only termination
is because you're only

00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:13.096
adding one base at a time.

00:24:13.096 --> 00:24:14.970
So if you have a single
gene in the template,

00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:15.803
you'll add one base.

00:24:15.803 --> 00:24:19.170
But if you have two Gs in the
template, you'll add two Cs.

00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:21.350
And in principle, you'll
get twice as much light.

00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:24.500
But then you have to sort of
do some analysis after the fact

00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:26.260
to say, OK how much
light do we have?

00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:28.322
And was that one G,
two G, and so forth.

00:24:28.322 --> 00:24:29.780
And the amount of
light is supposed

00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:33.440
to be linear up to
about five or six Gs.

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:38.230
But that's still a
more error-prone step.

00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:41.420
And the most common
type of error in 454

00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:45.700
is actually insertions
and deletions.

00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:48.970
Whereas in Illumina
sequencing, it's substitutions.

00:24:48.970 --> 00:24:51.280
David actually encouraged
me to talk more

00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:55.380
about sequencing errors
and quality scores.

00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:57.510
And I need to do a little
bit more background.

00:24:57.510 --> 00:25:03.580
But I may add that a little
bit later in the semester.

00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:05.810
OK, so in Illumina
sequencing, you

00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:09.180
add all four dNTPs
at the same time.

00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:10.920
But they're non-native.

00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:13.540
They have two major
modifications.

00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:16.490
So one is that they're
three prime blocked.

00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:18.525
That means that
the OH is not free,

00:25:18.525 --> 00:25:20.400
I'll show the chemical
structure in a moment.

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:22.025
So you can't extend
more than one base.

00:25:22.025 --> 00:25:24.710
You incorporate that one
base, and the polymerase

00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:25.880
can't do anything more.

00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:29.670
And they're also tagged
with four different fluors.

00:25:29.670 --> 00:25:31.910
So you add all
four dNTPs at once.

00:25:31.910 --> 00:25:34.590
You let the polymerase
incorporate them.

00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:37.690
And then you image
the whole flow cell

00:25:37.690 --> 00:25:39.150
using two lasers
and two filters.

00:25:39.150 --> 00:25:41.330
So basically, to
image the four fluors.

00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:44.220
So you have to sort of take
four different pictures

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:47.200
of each portion of the flow
cell and then the camera moves

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:49.360
and you scan the whole cell.

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:55.750
And so then, those clusters that
incorporated a C, let's say,

00:25:55.750 --> 00:25:58.710
they will show up in the
green channel as spots.

00:25:58.710 --> 00:26:00.460
And those incorporated
in A, and so forth.

00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:02.660
So you basically have these
clusters, each of them

00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:07.340
represents a distinct
template, and you

00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:08.630
read one base at a time.

00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:11.080
So, first you read the
first base after the primer.

00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:13.990
So it's sequencing
downwards into the template.

00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:15.599
And you read the
first base so you

00:26:15.599 --> 00:26:17.640
know what the first base
of all your clusters is.

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:20.720
And then you reverse
the termination.

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:22.870
You cleave off
that chemical group

00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:26.150
that was blocking the 3-prime
OH so now it can extend again.

00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:28.240
And then you add the
four dNTPs again,

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:31.339
do another round of extension,
and then image again,

00:26:31.339 --> 00:26:31.880
and so forth.

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:33.171
And so it takes a little while.

00:26:33.171 --> 00:26:35.050
Each round of imaging
takes about an hour.

00:26:35.050 --> 00:26:39.560
So if you want to do 100 base
single and Illumina sequencing,

00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:43.110
it'll be running on the machine
for about four days or so.

00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:45.240
Plus the time you have to
build the clusters, which

00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:47.650
might be several hours
on the day before.

00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:51.240
So what is this?

00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:55.570
So actually the whole idea
of blocking termination--

00:26:55.570 --> 00:26:59.300
basically Sanger's idea--
is carried over here

00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:01.140
in Illumina sequencing
with a little twist.

00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:03.760
And that's that you can
reverse the termination.

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:05.830
So if you look down
here at the bottom,

00:27:05.830 --> 00:27:09.030
these are two different
3-prime terminators.

00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:11.330
Remember your base counting.

00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:14.130
Base one, two, three.

00:27:14.130 --> 00:27:16.930
So this was the
3-prime OH, now it's

00:27:16.930 --> 00:27:19.740
got this methyl [INAUDIBLE],
or whatever that is.

00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:22.770
I'm not much of a chemist,
so you can look that one up.

00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:24.400
And then here's another version.

00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:25.816
And this is sort
of chemistry that

00:27:25.816 --> 00:27:27.670
can cleave this off
when you're done.

00:27:27.670 --> 00:27:31.060
And then this whole thing
here, hanging off the base,

00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:34.356
is the fluor.

00:27:34.356 --> 00:27:36.460
And you cleave that off as well.

00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:39.235
So you add this big complicated
thing, you image it,

00:27:39.235 --> 00:27:40.610
and then you cleave
off the fluor

00:27:40.610 --> 00:27:43.330
and cleave off
the 3-prime block.

00:27:45.776 --> 00:27:47.400
These are some actual
sequencing images

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:49.560
you would image in
the four channels.

00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:51.240
They're actually
black and white.

00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:53.080
These are pseudocode.

00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:56.330
And then you can merge
those and you can see then

00:27:56.330 --> 00:27:58.560
all the clusters
on the flow cell.

00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:02.070
So this is from a GA2 with
the recommended cluster

00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:04.960
density back in the day,
like a few years ago.

00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:06.877
And nowadays, the image
now since the software

00:28:06.877 --> 00:28:08.709
has gotten a lot better,
so you can actually

00:28:08.709 --> 00:28:10.840
load the clusters more
densely and therefore

00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:14.787
get more sequence
out of the same area.

00:28:14.787 --> 00:28:16.370
But imagine just
millions and millions

00:28:16.370 --> 00:28:18.820
of these little
clusters like this.

00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:21.570
Notice the clusters are
not all the same size.

00:28:24.390 --> 00:28:25.890
Basically, you're
doing PCR in situ,

00:28:25.890 --> 00:28:30.970
and so some molecules are easier
to amplify by PCR than others.

00:28:30.970 --> 00:28:33.605
And that probably accounts
for these variations in size.

00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:39.800
So what is the
current throughput?

00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:43.860
These data are accurate as
of about, maybe, last year.

00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:47.540
So the HiSeq 2000 instrument
is the most high performance,

00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:49.010
widely used instrument.

00:28:49.010 --> 00:28:51.840
Now there's a 2500, but I
think it's roughly similar.

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:52.820
You have one flow cell.

00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:55.220
So a flow cell looks sort
of like a glass slide,

00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:57.770
except that it has
these tunnels carved

00:28:57.770 --> 00:29:01.420
in it like eight little
tubes inside the glass slide.

00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:05.600
And on the surfaces
of those tubes

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:10.544
is where the adapters
are covalently attached.

00:29:10.544 --> 00:29:11.960
And so you have
eight lanes and so

00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:15.120
you can sequence eight different
things in those eight lanes.

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:20.300
You could do yeast genome
in one and fly RNA-seq

00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:23.850
in another, and so forth.

00:29:23.850 --> 00:29:27.850
And these days, a single
lane will produce something

00:29:27.850 --> 00:29:30.440
like 200 million reads.

00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:34.250
And this is typically routine
to get 200 million reads

00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:34.790
from a lane.

00:29:34.790 --> 00:29:36.770
Sometimes you can get more.

00:29:36.770 --> 00:29:38.200
You can do up to 100 bases.

00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:40.420
You can do 150 these
days on a MiSeq,

00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:41.780
which is a miniature version.

00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:46.000
You can do maybe 300 or more.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.290
And so that's a whole
lot of sequence.

00:29:48.290 --> 00:29:53.510
So that's 160 billion bases of
sequence from a single lane.

00:29:53.510 --> 00:29:56.890
And that will cost you-- that
single lane-- maybe $2,000

00:29:56.890 --> 00:29:59.870
to $3,000, depending
where you're doing it.

00:29:59.870 --> 00:30:03.000
And the cost doesn't
include the capital cost,

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.920
that's just the reagent
cost for running that.

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:11.240
So 160 billion-- the
human genome is 3 billion,

00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:14.850
so you've now sequenced the
human genome over many times

00:30:14.850 --> 00:30:16.440
there.

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:17.520
You can do more.

00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:19.070
So you can do
paired-end sequencing,

00:30:19.070 --> 00:30:21.380
where you sequence both
ends of your template.

00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:24.224
And that'll basically double
the amount of sequence you get.

00:30:24.224 --> 00:30:25.640
And you can also,
on this machine,

00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:26.840
do two flow cells at once.

00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:28.620
So you can actually
double it beyond that.

00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:33.796
And so for many applications,
160 billion bases is overkill.

00:30:33.796 --> 00:30:34.795
It's more than you need.

00:30:34.795 --> 00:30:36.836
Imagine you're doing
bacterial genome sequencing.

00:30:36.836 --> 00:30:39.150
Bacterial genome might
be five megabases or so.

00:30:39.150 --> 00:30:40.570
This is complete overkill.

00:30:40.570 --> 00:30:45.090
So you can do bar coding
where you add little six

00:30:45.090 --> 00:30:50.720
base tags to
different libraries,

00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:53.660
and then mix them together,
introduce them to the machine,

00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:56.370
sequence the tags
first or second,

00:30:56.370 --> 00:30:57.730
and then sequence the templates.

00:30:57.730 --> 00:31:00.980
And then you effectively
sort them out later.

00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:05.280
And then do many
samples in one lane.

00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:07.380
And that's what people
most commonly do.

00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:13.894
So, questions about
next-gen sequencing?

00:31:13.894 --> 00:31:15.060
There's a lot more to learn.

00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:16.393
I'm happy to talk about it more.

00:31:16.393 --> 00:31:18.170
It's very relevant
to this class.

00:31:18.170 --> 00:31:20.680
But I'm sure it'll come up
later in David's sections,

00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:23.610
so I don't want to take
too much time on it.

00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:34.620
So, now once you generate
reads from an Illumina

00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:36.570
instrument or some
other instrument,

00:31:36.570 --> 00:31:38.350
you'll want to align
them to the genome

00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:39.970
to determine, for
example, if you're

00:31:39.970 --> 00:31:44.590
doing RNA-seq mapping
reads that come from mRNA,

00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:47.360
you'll want to know what
genes they came from.

00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:50.900
So you need to map those
reads back to the genome.

00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:55.690
What are some other reasons you
might want to align sequences?

00:31:55.690 --> 00:31:57.950
Just in general, why
is aligning sequences--

00:31:57.950 --> 00:32:03.220
meaning, matching them up
and finding individual bases

00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:06.390
or amino acid residues that
match-- why is that useful?

00:32:06.390 --> 00:32:07.150
Diego?

00:32:07.150 --> 00:32:09.150
AUDIENCE: You can
assemble them if you want.

00:32:09.150 --> 00:32:09.820
PROFESSOR: You
can assemble them?

00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:10.040
Yes.

00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:11.706
So if you're doing
genome sequencing,

00:32:11.706 --> 00:32:13.330
if you align them to
each other and you

00:32:13.330 --> 00:32:16.570
find a whole stack that
sort of align this way,

00:32:16.570 --> 00:32:19.700
you can then assemble
and infer the existence

00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:20.780
of a longer sequence.

00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:21.880
That's a good point.

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:22.904
Yes, your name?

00:32:22.904 --> 00:32:23.810
AUDIENCE: Julianne.

00:32:23.810 --> 00:32:25.409
Looking at homologs.

00:32:25.409 --> 00:32:26.700
PROFESSOR: Looking at homologs.

00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:27.200
Right.

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:31.320
So if you, for example, are
doing disease gene mapping,

00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:35.150
you've identified a human
gene of unknown function

00:32:35.150 --> 00:32:38.230
that's associated
with a disease.

00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:41.580
Then you might want to search
it against, say, the mouse

00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:43.900
database and find
a homolog in mouse

00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:48.422
and then that might be what you
would want to study further.

00:32:48.422 --> 00:32:50.255
You might want to then
knock it out in mouse

00:32:50.255 --> 00:32:52.350
or mutate it or something.

00:32:52.350 --> 00:32:54.570
So those are some good reasons.

00:32:54.570 --> 00:32:56.310
There's others.

00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:59.460
So we're going to first talk
about local alignment, which

00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:01.110
is a type of alignment
where you want

00:33:01.110 --> 00:33:05.670
to find shorter stretches
of high similarity.

00:33:05.670 --> 00:33:08.980
You don't require alignment
of the entire sequence.

00:33:12.390 --> 00:33:15.767
So there are certain
situations where

00:33:15.767 --> 00:33:16.850
you might want to do that.

00:33:16.850 --> 00:33:19.250
So here's an example.

00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:22.020
You are studying a recently
discovered human non-coding

00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:22.520
RNA.

00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:25.330
As you can see, it's 45 bases.

00:33:25.330 --> 00:33:29.250
You want to see if
there's a mouse homolog.

00:33:29.250 --> 00:33:32.390
You run it through NCBI
BLAST, which as we said

00:33:32.390 --> 00:33:35.050
is sort of the Google search
engine of mathematics--

00:33:35.050 --> 00:33:38.890
and you're going get a chance
to do it on pump set one,

00:33:38.890 --> 00:33:42.120
and you get a hit
that looks like this.

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:45.005
So notice, this is
sort of BLAST notation.

00:33:45.005 --> 00:33:46.500
It says Q at the top.

00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:48.800
Q is for "query," that's
the sequence you put in.

00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:50.896
S is "subject,"
that's the database

00:33:50.896 --> 00:33:52.020
you were searching against.

00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:54.480
You have coordinates,
so 1 to 45.

00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:58.130
And then, in the subject, it
happened to be base 403 to 447

00:33:58.130 --> 00:34:00.440
in some mouse
chromosome or something.

00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:04.197
And you can see that
it's got some matching.

00:34:04.197 --> 00:34:05.530
But it also has some mismatches.

00:34:05.530 --> 00:34:09.699
So in all, there are 40
matches and five mismatches

00:34:09.699 --> 00:34:11.130
in the alignment.

00:34:11.130 --> 00:34:12.854
So is that significant?

00:34:15.370 --> 00:34:18.750
Remember, the mouse genome
is 2.7 billion bases long.

00:34:18.750 --> 00:34:19.550
It's big.

00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:22.919
So would you get a match
this good by chance?

00:34:25.570 --> 00:34:28.390
So the question is really,
should you trust this?

00:34:28.390 --> 00:34:30.980
Is this something you
can confidently say,

00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:34.220
yes mouse is a
homolog, and that's it?

00:34:34.220 --> 00:34:36.170
Or should you just
be like, well,

00:34:36.170 --> 00:34:38.059
that's not better
than I get by chance

00:34:38.059 --> 00:34:39.770
so I have no
evidence of anything?

00:34:39.770 --> 00:34:42.370
Or is it sort of
somewhere in between?

00:34:42.370 --> 00:34:46.350
And how would you tell?

00:34:46.350 --> 00:34:47.701
Yeah, what's your name?

00:34:47.701 --> 00:34:49.174
AUDIENCE: Chris.

00:34:49.174 --> 00:34:51.629
You would want to
figure out a scoring

00:34:51.629 --> 00:34:53.593
function for the alignment.

00:34:53.593 --> 00:34:55.557
And then, with that
scoring function,

00:34:55.557 --> 00:34:59.607
you would find whether or not
you have a significant match.

00:34:59.607 --> 00:35:00.190
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:35:00.190 --> 00:35:02.470
So Chris says you want to
define a scoring system

00:35:02.470 --> 00:35:05.430
and then use the
scoring system to define

00:35:05.430 --> 00:35:07.400
statistical significance.

00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:08.900
Do want to suggest
a scoring system?

00:35:12.370 --> 00:35:15.570
What's the simplest
one you can think of?

00:35:15.570 --> 00:35:20.460
AUDIENCE: Just if there's a
match, you add a certain score.

00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:25.230
If it's a mismatch, you
subtract a certain score.

00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:27.440
PROFESSOR: So let's do
that scoring system.

00:35:31.170 --> 00:35:34.520
So the notation that's
often used is Sii.

00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:36.870
So that would be a match
between nucleotide i

00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:38.660
and then another
copy of nucleotide i.

00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:41.890
We'll call that 1,
plus 1 for a match.

00:35:41.890 --> 00:35:46.195
And sij, where i
and j are different,

00:35:46.195 --> 00:35:47.570
we'll give that
a negative score.

00:35:47.570 --> 00:35:48.470
Minus 1.

00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:51.890
So this is i not equal to j.

00:35:51.890 --> 00:35:54.630
So that's a scoring matrix.

00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:57.630
It's a four by four matrix
with 1 on the diagonal

00:35:57.630 --> 00:36:00.540
and minus 1 everywhere else.

00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:02.500
And this is commonly
used for DNA.

00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:04.240
And then there's a
few other variations

00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:07.600
on this that are also used.

00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:09.012
So good, a scoring system.

00:36:09.012 --> 00:36:10.970
So then, how are we going
to do the statistics?

00:36:10.970 --> 00:36:12.169
Any ideas?

00:36:12.169 --> 00:36:13.585
How do we know
what's significant?

00:36:20.435 --> 00:36:22.348
AUDIENCE: The higher
score would probably

00:36:22.348 --> 00:36:28.156
be a little more significant
than a lower score.

00:36:28.156 --> 00:36:29.620
But the scale, I'm not sure--

00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:31.450
PROFESSOR: The scale
is not so obvious.

00:36:31.450 --> 00:36:32.498
Yes, question?

00:36:32.498 --> 00:36:33.664
AUDIENCE: My name is Andrea.

00:36:33.664 --> 00:36:37.600
So if you shuffled the RNA,
like permute the sequence,

00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:39.814
then we'll get the
[INAUDIBLE] genome

00:36:39.814 --> 00:36:42.028
you get with that
shuffled sequence.

00:36:42.028 --> 00:36:43.996
And the score is about
the same as you'd

00:36:43.996 --> 00:36:46.948
get with the non-shuffled
sequence [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:46.948 --> 00:36:48.920
about very significant scores.

00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:51.274
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so
that's a good idea.

00:36:51.274 --> 00:36:52.940
BLAST, as it turns
out-- is pretty fast.

00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:54.870
So you could shuffle
your RNA molecule,

00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:57.330
randomly permute the
nucleotides many times,

00:36:57.330 --> 00:36:59.190
maybe even like
1,000 times, search

00:36:59.190 --> 00:37:00.782
each one against
the mouse genome,

00:37:00.782 --> 00:37:02.490
and get a distribution
of what's the best

00:37:02.490 --> 00:37:05.505
score-- the top score-- that
you get against a genome,

00:37:05.505 --> 00:37:06.880
look at that
distribution and say

00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:08.420
whether the score
of the actual one

00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:10.560
is significantly higher
than that distribution

00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:12.476
or just falls in the
middle of that somewhere.

00:37:12.476 --> 00:37:15.680
And that's reasonable.

00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:18.380
You can certainly do that, and
it's not a bad thing to do.

00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:20.590
But it turns out there is
an analytical theory here

00:37:20.590 --> 00:37:21.720
that you can use.

00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:25.200
And so that you can determine
significance more quickly

00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:28.910
without doing so
much computation.

00:37:28.910 --> 00:37:30.890
And that's what
we'll talk about.

00:37:30.890 --> 00:37:33.489
But another issue, before
we get to the statistics,

00:37:33.489 --> 00:37:35.280
is how do you actually
find that alignment?

00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:39.420
How do you find the top scoring
match in a mouse genome?

00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:43.830
So let's suppose
this guy is your RNA.

00:37:43.830 --> 00:37:45.970
OK, of course, we're
using T's, but that's

00:37:45.970 --> 00:37:48.990
just because you usually
sequences it at the DNA level.

00:37:48.990 --> 00:37:50.300
But imagine this is your RNA.

00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:51.160
It's very short.

00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:54.390
This is like 10 or so, I think.

00:37:54.390 --> 00:37:56.365
And this is your database.

00:37:56.365 --> 00:38:01.490
But it goes on a
few billion more.

00:38:01.490 --> 00:38:02.980
Several more blackboards.

00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:08.410
And I want to come up
with an algorithm that

00:38:08.410 --> 00:38:12.730
will find the highest scoring
segment of this query sequence

00:38:12.730 --> 00:38:17.520
against this database.

00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:18.730
Any ideas?

00:38:18.730 --> 00:38:20.530
So this would be like
our first algorithm.

00:38:20.530 --> 00:38:25.640
And it's not terribly
hard, so that's

00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:28.100
why it's a good
one to start with.

00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:30.200
Not totally obvious either.

00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:33.200
Who can think of an algorithm
or something, some operation

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:36.010
that we can do on
this sequence compared

00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:37.950
to this sequence--
in some way-- that

00:38:37.950 --> 00:38:41.270
will help us find the
highest scoring match?

00:38:44.410 --> 00:38:45.740
I'm sorry.

00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:46.427
Yeah?

00:38:46.427 --> 00:38:49.410
AUDIENCE: You have to consider
insertion and deletion.

00:38:49.410 --> 00:38:50.390
PROFESSOR: Yeah, OK.

00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:52.210
So we're going to
keep it simple.

00:38:52.210 --> 00:38:53.210
That's true, in general.

00:38:53.210 --> 00:38:54.585
But we're going
to keep it simple

00:38:54.585 --> 00:38:57.390
and just say no
insertions and deletions.

00:38:57.390 --> 00:39:00.900
So we're going to look for
an ungapped local alignment.

00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:03.480
So that's the
algorithm that I want.

00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:04.940
First, no gaps.

00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:07.950
And then we'll do
gaps on Tuesday.

00:39:07.950 --> 00:39:08.920
Tim?

00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:11.860
AUDIENCE: You could just
compare your [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:16.270
to [INAUDIBLE] all
across the database

00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:21.170
and turn off all the
[INAUDIBLE] on that [INAUDIBLE],

00:39:21.170 --> 00:39:23.520
and then figure out [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:25.760
PROFESSOR: Yeah, OK.

00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:28.490
Pretty much.

00:39:28.490 --> 00:39:29.920
I mean, that's
pretty much right.

00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:32.800
Although it's not quite as
much of a description as

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:35.049
you would need if you want
to actually code that.

00:39:35.049 --> 00:39:36.590
Like, how would you
actually do that?

00:39:36.590 --> 00:39:38.810
So, I want a
description that is sort

00:39:38.810 --> 00:39:40.730
of more at the
level of pseudocode.

00:39:40.730 --> 00:39:43.670
Like, here's how you would
actually organize your code.

00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:48.560
So, let's say you
entertain the hypothesis

00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:53.690
that the alignment can be
in different registers.

00:39:53.690 --> 00:39:58.090
The alignment can correspond to
base one of the query and base

00:39:58.090 --> 00:39:59.820
one of the subject.

00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:01.500
Or it could be shifted.

00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:04.200
It could be an alignment
where base 1 of the query

00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:05.576
matches these two, and so forth.

00:40:05.576 --> 00:40:07.200
So there's sort of
different registers.

00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:09.280
So let's just consider
one register first.

00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:11.610
The one where base 1 matches.

00:40:11.610 --> 00:40:14.140
So let's just look
at the matches

00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:16.470
between corresponding bases.

00:40:16.470 --> 00:40:22.150
I'm just going to make these
little angle bracket guys here.

00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:25.565
Hopefully I won't
make any mistakes.

00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:30.100
I'm going to take this.

00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:32.460
This is sort of implementing
Tim's idea here.

00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:34.850
And then I'm going to
look for each of these--

00:40:34.850 --> 00:40:36.330
so consider it going down here.

00:40:36.330 --> 00:40:39.450
Now we're sort of looking
at an alignment here.

00:40:39.450 --> 00:40:42.000
Is this a match or a mismatch?

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:43.410
That's a mismatch.

00:40:43.410 --> 00:40:44.720
That's a match.

00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:46.750
That's a mismatch.

00:40:46.750 --> 00:40:47.790
That's a mismatch.

00:40:47.790 --> 00:40:48.860
That's a match.

00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:53.020
Match Match.

00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:53.570
Mismatch.

00:40:53.570 --> 00:40:55.180
Mismatch.

00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:57.760
Mismatch.

00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:01.670
So where is the
top scoring match

00:41:01.670 --> 00:41:04.750
between the query
and the subject?

00:41:04.750 --> 00:41:05.250
Tim?

00:41:11.770 --> 00:41:12.270
Anyone?

00:41:14.835 --> 00:41:16.280
AUDIENCE: 6, 7, 8.

00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:17.170
PROFESSOR: 6, 7, 8.

00:41:17.170 --> 00:41:18.111
Good.

00:41:18.111 --> 00:41:18.610
Oh--

00:41:18.610 --> 00:41:19.860
AUDIENCE: 5, 6, 7.

00:41:19.860 --> 00:41:21.130
PROFESSOR: 5, 6, 7.

00:41:21.130 --> 00:41:21.630
Right.

00:41:21.630 --> 00:41:22.870
Right here.

00:41:22.870 --> 00:41:26.444
You can see there's
three in a row.

00:41:26.444 --> 00:41:27.360
Well, what about this?

00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:28.900
Why can't we add
this to the match?

00:41:32.690 --> 00:41:36.510
What's the reason why
it's not 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7?

00:41:40.358 --> 00:41:42.290
AUDIENCE: Because the
score for that is lower.

00:41:42.290 --> 00:41:43.240
PROFESSOR: Because the
score for that is lower.

00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:43.740
Right.

00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:45.059
We defined top scoring segment.

00:41:45.059 --> 00:41:46.600
You sum up the scores
across the map.

00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:48.810
So you can have
mismatches in there,

00:41:48.810 --> 00:41:53.800
but this will have a score of 3.

00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:56.550
And if you wanted to
add these three bases,

00:41:56.550 --> 00:41:59.220
you would be adding
negative 2 and plus 1,

00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:01.000
so it would reduce your score.

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:02.340
So that would be worse.

00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:06.390
Any ideas on how to do this in
an automatic, algorithmic way?

00:42:10.191 --> 00:42:10.690
Yeah?

00:42:10.690 --> 00:42:11.680
What's your name?

00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:12.670
AUDIENCE: Simon.

00:42:12.670 --> 00:42:18.620
So if you keep shifting the
entire database, [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:21.290
PROFESSOR: OK so you
keep shifting it over,

00:42:21.290 --> 00:42:24.050
and you generate
one of these lines.

00:42:24.050 --> 00:42:27.890
But imagine my query was
like 1,000 or something.

00:42:27.890 --> 00:42:29.500
And my database
is like a billion.

00:42:33.229 --> 00:42:34.270
How do I look along here?

00:42:34.270 --> 00:42:37.000
And here it was obvious what
the top scoring match is.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:43.760
But if I had two
matches here, then we

00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:46.620
would've actually had
a longer match here.

00:42:46.620 --> 00:42:54.610
So in general, how do I
find that that top match?

00:42:54.610 --> 00:42:58.780
For each of those
registers, if you will,

00:42:58.780 --> 00:43:03.240
you'll have a thousand
long diagonal here

00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:06.520
with 1's and minus 1's on it.

00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:10.495
How do I process those scores
to find the top scoring segment?

00:43:16.409 --> 00:43:17.700
What's an algorithm to do that?

00:43:26.916 --> 00:43:28.290
It's kind of
intuitively obvious,

00:43:28.290 --> 00:43:31.190
but I want to do something
with, you define a variable

00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:34.597
and you update it, and you
add to it, and subtract.

00:43:34.597 --> 00:43:35.430
Something like that.

00:43:35.430 --> 00:43:37.700
But, like a computer
could actually handle.

00:43:41.001 --> 00:43:41.500
Yeah?

00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:42.291
What was your name?

00:43:42.291 --> 00:43:42.890
Julianne?

00:43:42.890 --> 00:43:47.246
AUDIENCE: Could you keep track
of what the highest total

00:43:47.246 --> 00:43:50.634
score is, and then you keep
going down the diagonal,

00:43:50.634 --> 00:43:53.197
And then you update it?

00:43:53.197 --> 00:43:53.780
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:43:53.780 --> 00:43:58.262
You keep track of what the
highest total score was?

00:43:58.262 --> 00:43:59.188
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:43:59.188 --> 00:44:01.040
The highest test score.

00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:03.320
PROFESSOR: The
highest segment score?

00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:05.440
OK.

00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:07.950
I'm going to put this up here.

00:44:07.950 --> 00:44:14.240
And we'll define max s.

00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:17.480
That's the highest segment
score we've achieved to date.

00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:21.404
And we'll initialize
that to zero, let's say.

00:44:21.404 --> 00:44:22.820
Because if you had
all mismatches,

00:44:22.820 --> 00:44:25.030
zero would be the
correct answer.

00:44:25.030 --> 00:44:28.320
If your query was A's
and your subject was T's.

00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:32.443
And then what do you do?

00:44:32.443 --> 00:44:37.126
AUDIENCE: As you go down the
diagonal, you keep track of--

00:44:37.126 --> 00:44:39.621
PROFESSOR: Keep track of what?

00:44:39.621 --> 00:44:45.609
AUDIENCE: So you
look at 1 in 1 first.

00:44:45.609 --> 00:44:48.603
And then you go 1 in 2, and
you find a score of zero.

00:44:48.603 --> 00:44:50.100
But that's higher
than negative 1.

00:44:54.110 --> 00:44:56.960
PROFESSOR: But the score of the
maximum segment at that point,

00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:59.870
after base 2, is not zero.

00:44:59.870 --> 00:45:01.970
It's actually 1.

00:45:01.970 --> 00:45:05.732
Because you could have a
segment of one base alignment.

00:45:05.732 --> 00:45:06.940
The cumulative score is zero.

00:45:09.105 --> 00:45:11.230
I think you're onto something
here that may be also

00:45:11.230 --> 00:45:14.640
something useful
to keep track of.

00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:18.280
Let's do the cumulative score
and then you tell me more.

00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:20.380
We'll define cumulative
score variable.

00:45:20.380 --> 00:45:21.930
We'll initialize that to zero.

00:45:21.930 --> 00:45:26.131
And then we'll have some for
loops that, as some of you

00:45:26.131 --> 00:45:29.840
have said, you want to
loop through the subject.

00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:33.120
All the possible
registers of the subject.

00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:35.780
So that would be
maybe j equals 1

00:45:35.780 --> 00:45:39.550
to subject length
minus query length.

00:45:39.550 --> 00:45:40.420
Something like that.

00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:42.290
Don't worry too much about this.

00:45:42.290 --> 00:45:44.200
Again, this is not
real code, obviously.

00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:44.960
It's pseudocode.

00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:47.870
So then this will be,
say, 1 to query language.

00:45:47.870 --> 00:45:50.255
And so this will be
going along our diagonal.

00:45:50.255 --> 00:45:52.130
And we're going to plot
the cumulative score.

00:45:54.690 --> 00:45:59.250
So here you would you have an
update where cumulative score

00:45:59.250 --> 00:46:07.760
plus equals the score
of query position

00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:13.714
i matched against
subject position j.

00:46:13.714 --> 00:46:14.380
And update that.

00:46:14.380 --> 00:46:15.740
So that's just cumulative score.

00:46:15.740 --> 00:46:16.823
So what will it look like?

00:46:16.823 --> 00:46:19.350
So in this case, I'll
just use this down here.

00:46:26.360 --> 00:46:35.390
So you have zero, 1,
2, minus 1, minus 2.

00:46:35.390 --> 00:46:39.460
So you'll start at position
zero in the sequence.

00:46:39.460 --> 00:46:43.400
At position 1 you're
down here at minus 1

00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:44.540
because it was a mismatch.

00:46:44.540 --> 00:46:49.550
Then at position 2, as you
said, we're back up to zero.

00:46:49.550 --> 00:46:51.130
And then what happens?

00:46:51.130 --> 00:46:54.500
Go down to minus
1, down to minus 2.

00:46:54.500 --> 00:47:02.719
Then we go up three times in a
row until we're up here to 1.

00:47:02.719 --> 00:47:04.010
And then we go down after that.

00:47:07.380 --> 00:47:11.780
So where is your highest scoring
match in this cumulative score

00:47:11.780 --> 00:47:12.280
plot?

00:47:16.030 --> 00:47:17.610
People said it was from 5 to 7.

00:47:17.610 --> 00:47:18.733
Yeah, question?

00:47:18.733 --> 00:47:20.816
AUDIENCE: So would it be
from like a local minimum

00:47:20.816 --> 00:47:22.290
to a local maximum?

00:47:22.290 --> 00:47:23.330
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:47:23.330 --> 00:47:24.690
Exactly.

00:47:24.690 --> 00:47:26.458
So, what do you want
to keep track of?

00:47:26.458 --> 00:47:29.916
AUDIENCE: You want to keep track
of the minimum and the maximum.

00:47:29.916 --> 00:47:34.870
And look for the range which
you maximize to different--

00:47:34.870 --> 00:47:37.111
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so
this is now sort of more

00:47:37.111 --> 00:47:38.610
what I was looking
for in terms of--

00:47:38.610 --> 00:47:43.100
so this was the local minimum,
and that's the local maximum.

00:47:43.100 --> 00:47:45.240
This is the score.

00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:48.100
That's your mass s there.

00:47:48.100 --> 00:47:50.910
And you also want to keep
track of where that happened

00:47:50.910 --> 00:47:52.970
in both the query
and the subject.

00:47:52.970 --> 00:47:53.910
Does that make sense?

00:47:53.910 --> 00:47:56.340
So you would keep track of
this running cumulative score

00:47:56.340 --> 00:47:57.200
variable.

00:47:57.200 --> 00:48:01.920
You keep track of
the last minimum.

00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:05.960
The minimum that
you've achieved so far.

00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:17.650
And so that would then
be down here to minus 2.

00:48:17.650 --> 00:48:20.280
And then when your cumulative
score got up to plus 1,

00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:22.760
you always take that
cumulative score,

00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:26.160
minus the last minimum
cumulative score.

00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:28.230
That gives you a
potential candidate

00:48:28.230 --> 00:48:29.370
for a high scoring segment.

00:48:29.370 --> 00:48:33.060
And if that is bigger than
your current max high scoring

00:48:33.060 --> 00:48:36.107
segment, then you update it
and you would update this.

00:48:36.107 --> 00:48:37.690
And then you would
also have variables

00:48:37.690 --> 00:48:41.210
that would store where you are.

00:48:41.210 --> 00:48:44.419
And also, where did
that last minimum occur.

00:48:44.419 --> 00:48:45.710
So I'm not spelling it all out.

00:48:45.710 --> 00:48:47.543
I'm not going to give
you all the variables.

00:48:47.543 --> 00:48:51.745
But this is an algorithm that
would find the maximum score.

00:48:51.745 --> 00:48:52.370
Yeah, question?

00:48:52.370 --> 00:48:53.745
AUDIENCE: So you're
keeping track

00:48:53.745 --> 00:48:56.500
of the global maximum,
local minimum,

00:48:56.500 --> 00:49:00.530
so that you can accept the most
recent local minimum following

00:49:00.530 --> 00:49:02.575
the global maximum?

00:49:02.575 --> 00:49:04.200
PROFESSOR: I'm not
sure I got all that.

00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:07.800
But you're keeping track
of the cumulative score.

00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:12.680
The minimum that that
cumulative score ever got to.

00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:17.556
And the maximum
difference, the maximum

00:49:17.556 --> 00:49:21.940
that you ever in the
past have gone up.

00:49:21.940 --> 00:49:27.060
Where you've had a
net increment upwards.

00:49:27.060 --> 00:49:27.970
Like here.

00:49:27.970 --> 00:49:30.400
So this variable
here, this max s,

00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:32.000
it would be initialized to zero.

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:36.780
When you got to here, your last
minimum score would be minus 1.

00:49:36.780 --> 00:49:38.500
Your cumulative
score would be zero.

00:49:38.500 --> 00:49:40.916
You would take the difference
of those, and you'd be like,

00:49:40.916 --> 00:49:43.204
oh I've got a high scoring
segment of score one.

00:49:43.204 --> 00:49:44.370
So I'm going to update that.

00:49:44.370 --> 00:49:48.690
So now, that variable
is now 1 at this point.

00:49:48.690 --> 00:49:51.300
Then you're going down, so
you're not getting anything.

00:49:51.300 --> 00:49:53.520
You're just lowering this
minimum cumulative score

00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:55.070
down to minus 2 here.

00:49:55.070 --> 00:49:58.057
And then when you
get to here, now you

00:49:58.057 --> 00:50:00.140
check the cumulative score
minus the last minimum.

00:50:00.140 --> 00:50:00.880
It's 1.

00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:02.300
That's a tie.

00:50:02.300 --> 00:50:04.550
We won't keep track of ties.

00:50:04.550 --> 00:50:07.820
Now at here, that
difference is 2.

00:50:07.820 --> 00:50:10.180
So now we've got a new record.

00:50:10.180 --> 00:50:14.090
So now we update this maximum
score to 2 in the locations.

00:50:14.090 --> 00:50:16.830
And then we get here, now
it's 3, and we update that.

00:50:16.830 --> 00:50:17.825
Does that make sense?

00:50:17.825 --> 00:50:20.116
AUDIENCE: Imagine the first
dip-- instead of going down

00:50:20.116 --> 00:50:22.760
to negative 1, it went
down to negative 3.

00:50:22.760 --> 00:50:23.731
PROFESSOR: Negative 3?

00:50:23.731 --> 00:50:25.284
AUDIENCE: That first dip.

00:50:25.284 --> 00:50:26.200
PROFESSOR: Right here?

00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:28.160
So we started back a little bit.

00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:30.265
So back here, like this?

00:50:30.265 --> 00:50:31.250
AUDIENCE: No.

00:50:31.250 --> 00:50:32.500
PROFESSOR: Down to negative 3?

00:50:32.500 --> 00:50:33.550
AUDIENCE: No.

00:50:33.550 --> 00:50:35.341
PROFESSOR: But how do
we get to negative 3?

00:50:35.341 --> 00:50:36.970
Because our scoring is this way.

00:50:36.970 --> 00:50:38.580
You want this dip to minus 3?

00:50:38.580 --> 00:50:39.584
AUDIENCE: No

00:50:39.584 --> 00:50:40.750
PROFESSOR: This one minus 3?

00:50:40.750 --> 00:50:42.367
Imagine we are at minus 3 here?

00:50:42.367 --> 00:50:42.992
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:50:42.992 --> 00:50:45.347
Imagine it dipped to minus 3.

00:50:45.347 --> 00:50:49.770
And then the next one dipped to
higher than that, to minus 2.

00:50:49.770 --> 00:50:51.714
And then it went up to 1.

00:50:51.714 --> 00:50:54.630
And so, would the difference
you look at be negative 2 to 1,

00:50:54.630 --> 00:50:56.100
or negative 3 to 1?

00:50:56.100 --> 00:50:57.710
PROFESSOR: Like that, right?

00:50:57.710 --> 00:51:02.250
So, minus 3, let's
say, minus 2, 1.

00:51:02.250 --> 00:51:04.010
Something like that.

00:51:04.010 --> 00:51:05.856
What do people think?

00:51:05.856 --> 00:51:07.175
Anyone want to--?

00:51:07.175 --> 00:51:08.480
AUDIENCE: Minus 3 to 1.

00:51:08.480 --> 00:51:10.100
PROFESSOR: Minus 3 to 1.

00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:13.051
It's the minimum
that you ever got to.

00:51:13.051 --> 00:51:16.120
This might be a stronger match,
but this is a higher scoring

00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:16.620
match.

00:51:16.620 --> 00:51:18.620
And we said we want
higher scoring.

00:51:18.620 --> 00:51:21.716
So you would count that.

00:51:21.716 --> 00:51:23.966
AUDIENCE: So you keep track
of both the global minimum

00:51:23.966 --> 00:51:25.490
and the global
maximum, and you take

00:51:25.490 --> 00:51:27.322
the difference between them.

00:51:27.322 --> 00:51:29.280
PROFESSOR: You keep track
of the global minimum

00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:31.134
and the current
cumulative score,

00:51:31.134 --> 00:51:32.300
and you take the difference.

00:51:35.186 --> 00:51:38.080
AUDIENCE: The global maximum--

00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:40.210
PROFESSOR: It's not
necessarily global maximum

00:51:40.210 --> 00:51:43.390
because we could be
well below zero here.

00:51:43.390 --> 00:51:44.389
We could do like this.

00:51:49.550 --> 00:51:50.880
From here to here.

00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:53.440
So this is not the
global maximum.

00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:57.270
This just happens
to be, we went up

00:51:57.270 --> 00:51:58.510
a lot since our last minimum.

00:51:58.510 --> 00:52:00.950
So that's your high
scoring segment.

00:52:00.950 --> 00:52:02.582
Does that make sense?

00:52:04.961 --> 00:52:06.460
I haven't completely
spelled it out.

00:52:06.460 --> 00:52:12.300
But I think you guys have given
enough ideas here that there;s

00:52:12.300 --> 00:52:14.100
sort of the core
of an algorithm.

00:52:14.100 --> 00:52:21.230
And I encourage you to think
this through afterwards

00:52:21.230 --> 00:52:24.090
and let me know if
there are questions.

00:52:24.090 --> 00:52:27.700
And we could add an
optional homework

00:52:27.700 --> 00:52:29.700
where I ask you to do
this, that we've sometimes

00:52:29.700 --> 00:52:30.740
had in the past.

00:52:30.740 --> 00:52:33.090
It is a useful thing to look at.

00:52:33.090 --> 00:52:35.530
This is not exactly how
the BLAST algorithm works.

00:52:35.530 --> 00:52:38.330
It uses some tricks
for faster speed.

00:52:38.330 --> 00:52:40.900
But this is sort of
morally equivalent to BLAST

00:52:40.900 --> 00:52:46.340
in the sense that it has the
same order of magnitude running

00:52:46.340 --> 00:52:48.780
time.

00:52:48.780 --> 00:52:54.960
So this algorithm-- what is the
running time in Big-O notation?

00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:58.800
So just for those who
are non-CS people, when

00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:02.840
you use this Big-O notation,
then you're asking,

00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:05.010
how does the running
time increase

00:53:05.010 --> 00:53:07.560
in the size of the input?

00:53:07.560 --> 00:53:08.870
And so what is the input?

00:53:08.870 --> 00:53:10.440
So we have two inputs.

00:53:10.440 --> 00:53:14.070
We have a query of length.

00:53:14.070 --> 00:53:17.670
And let's say
subject of length n.

00:53:17.670 --> 00:53:21.171
So clearly, if those are bigger,
it'll take longer to run.

00:53:21.171 --> 00:53:22.920
But when you compare
different algorithms,

00:53:22.920 --> 00:53:26.971
you want to know how the run
time depends on those lengths.

00:53:26.971 --> 00:53:27.470
Yes.

00:53:27.470 --> 00:53:28.356
What's your name?

00:53:28.356 --> 00:53:29.308
AUDIENCE: Sally.

00:53:29.308 --> 00:53:31.509
m times n.

00:53:31.509 --> 00:53:33.050
PROFESSOR: So with
this, this is what

00:53:33.050 --> 00:53:35.940
you would call an
order mn algorithm.

00:53:35.940 --> 00:53:36.900
And why is that?

00:53:36.900 --> 00:53:38.220
How can you see that?

00:53:38.220 --> 00:53:40.806
AUDIENCE: You have two for
loops And for each length,

00:53:40.806 --> 00:53:42.639
essentially, you're
going through everything

00:53:42.639 --> 00:53:45.094
in the query.

00:53:45.094 --> 00:53:48.040
And then, for everything that
you go through in the query,

00:53:48.040 --> 00:53:49.022
you would [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:52.970 --> 00:53:55.270
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:53:55.270 --> 00:53:59.800
In this second for loop here,
you're going through the query.

00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:02.420
And you're doing that
nested inside of a for loop

00:54:02.420 --> 00:54:05.112
that's basically the
length of the subject.

00:54:05.112 --> 00:54:06.570
And eventually
you're going to have

00:54:06.570 --> 00:54:07.986
to compare every
base in the query

00:54:07.986 --> 00:54:09.296
to every base in the subject.

00:54:09.296 --> 00:54:10.420
There's no way around that.

00:54:10.420 --> 00:54:13.270
And that takes
some unit of time.

00:54:13.270 --> 00:54:15.900
And so the actual time will
be proportional to that.

00:54:15.900 --> 00:54:18.220
So the bigger n gets
and m gets, it's

00:54:18.220 --> 00:54:20.150
just proportional
to the product.

00:54:20.150 --> 00:54:21.460
Does that make sense?

00:54:21.460 --> 00:54:24.010
Or another way to
think about it is,

00:54:24.010 --> 00:54:26.594
you're clearly going to have to
do something on this diagonal.

00:54:26.594 --> 00:54:28.468
And then you're going
to have to do something

00:54:28.468 --> 00:54:30.530
on this diagonal, and
this one, and this one.

00:54:30.530 --> 00:54:34.280
And actually, you have to
also check these ones here.

00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:39.380
And in the end, the total
number of computations

00:54:39.380 --> 00:54:41.900
there is going to
be this times that.

00:54:41.900 --> 00:54:43.680
You're basically doing
a rectangle's worth

00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:45.606
of computations.

00:54:45.606 --> 00:54:47.430
Does that makes sense?

00:54:47.430 --> 00:54:49.120
So that's not bad, right?

00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:50.940
It could be worse.

00:54:50.940 --> 00:54:54.790
It could be, like, mn squared
or something like that.

00:54:57.550 --> 00:55:01.030
So that's basically
why BLAST is fast.

00:55:01.030 --> 00:55:03.190
So what do these things
look like, in general?

00:55:03.190 --> 00:55:07.180
And what is the condition on
our score for this algorithm

00:55:07.180 --> 00:55:07.680
to work?

00:55:12.460 --> 00:55:16.260
What if I gave a score
of plus 1 for a match,

00:55:16.260 --> 00:55:17.820
and zero for a mismatch?

00:55:17.820 --> 00:55:20.340
Could we do this?

00:55:20.340 --> 00:55:21.990
Joe, you're shaking your head.

00:55:21.990 --> 00:55:23.490
AUDIENCE: It would
just be going up.

00:55:23.490 --> 00:55:24.156
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:55:24.156 --> 00:55:26.311
The problem is, it might
be flat for a while,

00:55:26.311 --> 00:55:27.560
but eventually it would go up.

00:55:27.560 --> 00:55:29.143
And it would just
go up and up and up.

00:55:29.143 --> 00:55:30.650
And so your highest
scoring segment

00:55:30.650 --> 00:55:32.430
would, most of the
time, be something

00:55:32.430 --> 00:55:34.040
that started very
near the beginning

00:55:34.040 --> 00:55:36.720
and ended very near the end.

00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:37.790
So that doesn't work.

00:55:37.790 --> 00:55:40.015
So you have to have
a net negative drift.

00:55:40.015 --> 00:55:42.140
And the way that's formalized
is the expected score

00:55:42.140 --> 00:55:43.980
has to be negative.

00:55:43.980 --> 00:55:46.970
So why is the expected score
negative in this scoring system

00:55:46.970 --> 00:55:50.379
that has plus 1 for a match,
and minus 1 for a mismatch?

00:55:50.379 --> 00:55:51.170
Why does that work?

00:55:54.507 --> 00:55:56.840
AUDIENCE: It should be wrong
three quarters of the time.

00:55:56.840 --> 00:55:57.590
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:55:57.590 --> 00:55:59.673
You'll have a mismatch
three quarters of the time.

00:55:59.673 --> 00:56:04.040
So on average, you
tend to drift down.

00:56:04.040 --> 00:56:06.440
And then you have these
little excursions upwards,

00:56:06.440 --> 00:56:09.410
and those are your
high scoring segments.

00:56:09.410 --> 00:56:13.216
Any questions about that?

00:56:13.216 --> 00:56:14.178
AUDIENCE: Question.

00:56:14.178 --> 00:56:17.795
Is there something
better than m times n?

00:56:17.795 --> 00:56:19.920
PROFESSOR: We've got some
computer scientists here.

00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:22.194
David?

00:56:22.194 --> 00:56:23.110
Better than m times n?

00:56:23.110 --> 00:56:24.544
I don't think so,
because you have

00:56:24.544 --> 00:56:25.710
to do all those comparisons.

00:56:25.710 --> 00:56:29.530
And so there's no way around
that, so I don't think so.

00:56:29.530 --> 00:56:31.070
All right.

00:56:31.070 --> 00:56:33.180
But the constant--
you can do better

00:56:33.180 --> 00:56:35.076
on the constant than
this algorithm thing.

00:56:35.076 --> 00:56:36.955
AUDIENCE: With
multiple queries--

00:56:36.955 --> 00:56:38.580
PROFESSOR: With
multiple queries, yeah.

00:56:38.580 --> 00:56:41.720
Then you can maybe
do some hashing

00:56:41.720 --> 00:56:45.720
or find some-- to speed it up.

00:56:45.720 --> 00:56:48.560
OK, so what about the
statistics of this?

00:56:48.560 --> 00:56:54.790
So it turns out that Karlin and
Altschul developed some theory

00:56:54.790 --> 00:56:57.410
for just exactly this problem.

00:56:57.410 --> 00:57:00.210
For searching a query sequence.

00:57:00.210 --> 00:57:04.240
It can be nucleotide or protein
as long as you have integer

00:57:04.240 --> 00:57:09.700
scores and the average-- or the
expected-- score is negative,

00:57:09.700 --> 00:57:13.520
then this theory
tells you how often

00:57:13.520 --> 00:57:17.890
the highest score of all--
across the entire query

00:57:17.890 --> 00:57:20.430
database comparison--
exceeds a cut

00:57:20.430 --> 00:57:25.300
off x using a local alignment
algorithm such as BLAST.

00:57:25.300 --> 00:57:30.380
And it turns out
that these scores

00:57:30.380 --> 00:57:34.240
follow what's called an extreme
value or Gumbel distribution.

00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:39.340
And it has this kind of
double exponential form here.

00:57:39.340 --> 00:57:40.620
So x is some cut off.

00:57:40.620 --> 00:57:43.760
So usually x would be the
score that you actually

00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:46.530
observed when you searched your
query against the database.

00:57:46.530 --> 00:57:47.980
That's the one you care about.

00:57:47.980 --> 00:57:49.870
And then you want
to know, what's

00:57:49.870 --> 00:57:53.980
the probability we would've
seen something higher than that?

00:57:53.980 --> 00:58:00.150
Or you might do x is one less
than the score you observed.

00:58:00.150 --> 00:58:04.190
So what's the chance we
observed something the same,

00:58:04.190 --> 00:58:06.775
as good as this, or better?

00:58:06.775 --> 00:58:07.650
Does that make sense?

00:58:07.650 --> 00:58:11.100
And so this is going to
be your P value then.

00:58:11.100 --> 00:58:13.740
So the probability
of S. The score

00:58:13.740 --> 00:58:16.699
of the highest segment
under a model where

00:58:16.699 --> 00:58:18.740
you have a random query
against a random database

00:58:18.740 --> 00:58:22.500
of the same length is 1
minus e to the minus KMN

00:58:22.500 --> 00:58:24.790
e to the minus lambda x.

00:58:24.790 --> 00:58:30.030
Where M and N are the lengths
of the query and the database.

00:58:30.030 --> 00:58:32.360
x is the score.

00:58:32.360 --> 00:58:35.860
And then K and lambda are
two positive parameters

00:58:35.860 --> 00:58:39.760
that depend actually on the
details of your score matrix

00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:42.990
and the composition
of your sequences.

00:58:42.990 --> 00:58:47.190
And it turns out that lambda
is really the one that matters.

00:58:47.190 --> 00:58:48.940
And you can see
that because lambda

00:58:48.940 --> 00:58:52.279
is up there in that
exponent multiplying x.

00:58:52.279 --> 00:58:53.820
So if you double
lambda, that'll have

00:58:53.820 --> 00:58:56.660
a big effect on the answer.

00:58:56.660 --> 00:58:58.550
And K, it turns
out, you can mostly

00:58:58.550 --> 00:59:01.650
ignore it for most purposes.

00:59:01.650 --> 00:59:04.840
So as a formula, what
does this thing look like?

00:59:04.840 --> 00:59:07.244
It looks like that.

00:59:07.244 --> 00:59:08.160
Kind of a funny shape.

00:59:08.160 --> 00:59:10.210
It sort of looks like
an umlauf a little bit,

00:59:10.210 --> 00:59:15.540
but then has a different shape
on the right than the left.

00:59:15.540 --> 00:59:18.130
And how do you
calculate this lambda?

00:59:18.130 --> 00:59:23.530
So I said that lambda is
sort of the key to all this

00:59:23.530 --> 00:59:31.630
because of its uniquely
important place

00:59:31.630 --> 00:59:36.300
in that formula,
multiplying the score.

00:59:36.300 --> 00:59:39.230
So it turns out that lambda is
the unique positive solution

00:59:39.230 --> 00:59:41.250
to this equation here.

00:59:41.250 --> 00:59:44.990
So now it actually depends
on the scoring matrix.

00:59:44.990 --> 00:59:46.710
So you see there's sij there.

00:59:46.710 --> 00:59:49.190
It depends on the
composition of your query.

00:59:49.190 --> 00:59:50.540
That's the pi's.

00:59:50.540 --> 00:59:55.820
The composition of your
subject, that's the rj's.

00:59:55.820 --> 00:59:59.020
You sum over the i
and j equal to each

00:59:59.020 --> 01:00:01.340
of the four nucleotides.

01:00:01.340 --> 01:00:03.110
And that sum has to be 1.

01:00:03.110 --> 01:00:08.830
So there's a unique positive
solution to this equation.

01:00:08.830 --> 01:00:11.210
So how would we solve
an equation like this?

01:00:11.210 --> 01:00:12.980
First of all, what
kind of equation

01:00:12.980 --> 01:00:17.460
is this, given that we're
going to set the sij,

01:00:17.460 --> 01:00:20.710
and we're going to just
measure the pi and the rj?

01:00:20.710 --> 01:00:23.470
So those are all
known constants,

01:00:23.470 --> 01:00:25.890
and lambda is what we're
trying to solve for here.

01:00:25.890 --> 01:00:28.791
So what kind of an
equation is this in lambda?

01:00:35.850 --> 01:00:36.350
Linear?

01:00:36.350 --> 01:00:38.550
Quadratic?

01:00:38.550 --> 01:00:40.890
Hyperbolic?

01:00:40.890 --> 01:00:43.750
Anybody know what this is?

01:00:43.750 --> 01:00:47.660
So this is called a
transcendental equation

01:00:47.660 --> 01:00:51.430
because you have
different powers.

01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:59.245
That sounds kind of unpleasant.

01:00:59.245 --> 01:01:01.440
You don't take a class in
transcendental equations

01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:01.940
probably.

01:01:01.940 --> 01:01:08.270
So in general, they're not
possible to solve analytically

01:01:08.270 --> 01:01:10.560
when they get complicated.

01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:13.380
But in simple cases, you
can solve them analytically.

01:01:13.380 --> 01:01:17.420
And in fact, let's just do one.

01:01:17.420 --> 01:01:19.450
So let's take the
simplest case, which

01:01:19.450 --> 01:01:25.230
would be that all the
pi's are a quarter.

01:01:25.230 --> 01:01:29.020
All the ri's are a quarter.

01:01:29.020 --> 01:01:31.990
And we'll use the scoring system
that we came up with before,

01:01:31.990 --> 01:01:37.710
where sii is 1,
and sij is minus 1.

01:01:37.710 --> 01:01:41.640
If i does not equal j.

01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:50.250
And so when we plug those in to
that sum there, what do we get?

01:01:50.250 --> 01:01:56.190
We'll get four terms that are
one quarter, times one quarter,

01:01:56.190 --> 01:01:59.710
times e to the lambda.

01:01:59.710 --> 01:02:03.817
There's four possible
types of matches, right?

01:02:03.817 --> 01:02:05.900
They have probability one
quarter times a quarter.

01:02:05.900 --> 01:02:07.710
That's pi and rj.

01:02:07.710 --> 01:02:12.450
And the e to the lambda
sii is just e to the lambda

01:02:12.450 --> 01:02:14.130
because sii is 1.

01:02:14.130 --> 01:02:19.680
And then there's 12 terms that
are one quarter, one quarter,

01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:21.270
e to the minus lambda.

01:02:21.270 --> 01:02:23.150
Because there's
the minus 1 score.

01:02:23.150 --> 01:02:26.610
And that has to equal 1.

01:02:26.610 --> 01:02:32.210
So cancel this, we'll
multiply through by 4, maybe.

01:02:32.210 --> 01:02:39.720
So now we get e to
the lambda plus 3.

01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:43.050
e to the minus lambda equals 1.

01:02:43.050 --> 01:02:45.050
It's still a
transcendental equation,

01:02:45.050 --> 01:02:47.710
but it's looking
a little simpler.

01:02:47.710 --> 01:02:49.630
Any ideas how to
solve this for lambda?

01:02:52.140 --> 01:02:53.228
Sally?

01:02:53.228 --> 01:02:54.875
AUDIENCE: Wouldn't the 1 be 4?

01:02:54.875 --> 01:02:55.750
PROFESSOR: I'm sorry.

01:02:55.750 --> 01:02:56.160
4.

01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:56.670
Thank you.

01:03:06.730 --> 01:03:07.778
Yeah, what's your name?

01:03:07.778 --> 01:03:10.772
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] I think
[INAUDIBLE] quadratic equation.

01:03:10.772 --> 01:03:14.764
If you multiply both sides by
[INAUDIBLE] then [INAUDIBLE].

01:03:16.672 --> 01:03:18.130
PROFESSOR: OK, so
the claim is this

01:03:18.130 --> 01:03:19.460
is basically a
quadratic equation.

01:03:19.460 --> 01:03:21.376
So you multiply both
sides by e to the lambda.

01:03:21.376 --> 01:03:24.697
So then you get e to
the 2 lambda plus 3.

01:03:24.697 --> 01:03:26.530
And then it's going to
move this over and do

01:03:26.530 --> 01:03:31.580
minus 4 e to the
lambda equals zero.

01:03:31.580 --> 01:03:33.340
Is that good?

01:03:33.340 --> 01:03:35.607
So how is it quadratic?

01:03:35.607 --> 01:03:37.190
What do you actually
do to solve this?

01:03:37.190 --> 01:03:38.356
AUDIENCE: Well, [INAUDIBLE].

01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:45.000
PROFESSOR: Change the variable,
x equals e to the lambda.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:46.330
Then it's quadratic in x.

01:03:46.330 --> 01:03:46.990
Solve for x.

01:03:46.990 --> 01:03:48.440
We all know how to solve
quadratic equations.

01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:49.760
And then substitute
that for lambda.

01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:50.800
OK, everyone got that?

01:03:55.845 --> 01:03:58.120
If you use 16 different
scores to represent

01:03:58.120 --> 01:04:00.250
all the different types
of matches and mismatches,

01:04:00.250 --> 01:04:03.060
this will be very unpleasant.

01:04:03.060 --> 01:04:04.940
It's not unsolvable,
it's just that you

01:04:04.940 --> 01:04:08.520
have to use computational
numerical methods to solve it.

01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:10.184
But in simple cases
where you just

01:04:10.184 --> 01:04:11.850
have a couple different
types of scores,

01:04:11.850 --> 01:04:15.530
it will often be a
quadratic equation.

01:04:15.530 --> 01:04:16.080
All right.

01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:20.140
So let's suppose that we have
a particular scoring system--

01:04:20.140 --> 01:04:24.610
particular pi's, rj's-- and
we have a value of lambda that

01:04:24.610 --> 01:04:25.280
satisfies those.

01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:28.370
So we've solved this
quadratic equation for lambda.

01:04:28.370 --> 01:04:30.240
I think we get lambda
equals natural log

01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:32.690
3, something like that.

01:04:32.690 --> 01:04:34.660
Remember, it's a unique
positive solution.

01:04:34.660 --> 01:04:35.370
Quadratic equations
are two solutions,

01:04:35.370 --> 01:04:37.286
but there's going to be
just one positive one.

01:04:37.286 --> 01:04:41.230
And then we have that value.

01:04:41.230 --> 01:04:43.960
It satisfies this equation.

01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:47.200
So then, what if we
double the scores?

01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:50.340
Instead of plus 1 minus
1, we use plus 2 minus 2?

01:04:53.020 --> 01:04:55.850
What would then happen?

01:04:55.850 --> 01:04:58.440
You can see that the
original version of lambda

01:04:58.440 --> 01:05:01.860
wouldn't necessarily still
satisfy this equation.

01:05:01.860 --> 01:05:04.080
But if you think
about it a little bit,

01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:08.370
you can figure out what
new value of lambda

01:05:08.370 --> 01:05:09.692
would satisfy this equation.

01:05:14.860 --> 01:05:19.365
We've solved for the lambda
that solves with these scores.

01:05:23.502 --> 01:05:24.960
Now we're going to
have new scores.

01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:28.530
sii prime equals 2.

01:05:28.530 --> 01:05:34.080
sij prime equals minus 2.

01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:35.666
What is lambda prime?

01:05:35.666 --> 01:05:37.290
The lambda that goes
with these scores?

01:05:39.850 --> 01:05:40.860
Yeah, go ahead.

01:05:40.860 --> 01:05:42.217
AUDIENCE: Half of the original?

01:05:42.217 --> 01:05:43.550
PROFESSOR: Half of the original?

01:05:43.550 --> 01:05:44.050
Right.

01:05:44.050 --> 01:05:46.974
So you're saying that lambda
prime equals lambda over 2.

01:05:46.974 --> 01:05:47.640
And why is that?

01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:50.965
Can you explain?

01:05:50.965 --> 01:05:52.506
AUDIENCE: Because
of the [INAUDIBLE].

01:05:59.530 --> 01:06:03.980
PROFESSOR: Yeah, if you think
about these terms in the sum,

01:06:03.980 --> 01:06:05.940
the s part is all doubling.

01:06:05.940 --> 01:06:09.380
So if you cut the lambda apart,
and the product will equal what

01:06:09.380 --> 01:06:10.650
it did before.

01:06:10.650 --> 01:06:13.370
And we haven't changed the pi's
and rj's, so all those terms

01:06:13.370 --> 01:06:14.590
will be the same.

01:06:14.590 --> 01:06:17.400
So therefore, it will still
satisfy that equation.

01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:19.900
So that's another way
of thinking about it.

01:06:19.900 --> 01:06:21.210
Yes, you're correct.

01:06:21.210 --> 01:06:23.770
So if you double
the scores, lambda

01:06:23.770 --> 01:06:27.090
will be reduced
by a factor of 2.

01:06:27.090 --> 01:06:28.880
So what does that
tell us about lambda?

01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:32.994
What is it?

01:06:32.994 --> 01:06:34.443
What is its meaning?

01:06:40.250 --> 01:06:41.416
Yeah, go ahead, Jeff.

01:06:41.416 --> 01:06:42.874
AUDIENCE: Scale of
the distribution

01:06:42.874 --> 01:06:45.808
to the expectant score?

01:06:45.808 --> 01:06:47.104
Or the range score?

01:06:47.104 --> 01:06:47.770
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:06:47.770 --> 01:06:50.240
It basically scales the scores.

01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:55.040
So we can have the
same equation here used

01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:56.200
with arbitrary scoring.

01:06:56.200 --> 01:06:56.960
It just scales it.

01:06:56.960 --> 01:06:59.410
You can see the way it appears
as a multiplicative factor

01:06:59.410 --> 01:07:00.326
in front of the score.

01:07:00.326 --> 01:07:03.050
So if you double all
the scores, will that

01:07:03.050 --> 01:07:04.880
change what the highest
scoring segment is?

01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:09.620
No, it won't change
it because you'll

01:07:09.620 --> 01:07:11.890
have this cumulative thing.

01:07:11.890 --> 01:07:14.450
It just changes how
you label the y-axis.

01:07:14.450 --> 01:07:19.505
It'll make it bigger, but it
won't change what that is.

01:07:19.505 --> 01:07:21.210
And if you look
at this equation,

01:07:21.210 --> 01:07:23.650
it won't change the
statistical significance.

01:07:23.650 --> 01:07:27.620
The x will double in value,
because all the matches are now

01:07:27.620 --> 01:07:30.360
worth twice as much as
what they were before.

01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:33.110
But lambda will be half
as big, and so the product

01:07:33.110 --> 01:07:35.360
will be the same and therefore,
the final probability

01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:36.150
will be the same.

01:07:36.150 --> 01:07:38.850
So it's just a scaling factor
for using different scoring

01:07:38.850 --> 01:07:39.350
systems.

01:07:44.281 --> 01:07:45.030
Everyone got that?

01:07:47.820 --> 01:07:48.320
All right.

01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:51.820
So what scoring matrix
should we use for DNA?

01:07:51.820 --> 01:07:53.450
How about this one?

01:07:53.450 --> 01:07:56.010
So this is now a
slight generalization.

01:07:56.010 --> 01:08:00.530
So we're going to keep
1 for the matches.

01:08:00.530 --> 01:08:03.450
You don't lose any generality
by choosing 1 here for matches,

01:08:03.450 --> 01:08:07.500
because if you use 2,
then lambda is just

01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:09.990
going to be reduced
to compensate.

01:08:09.990 --> 01:08:11.360
So 1 for matches.

01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:15.590
And then we're going to
use m for mismatches.

01:08:15.590 --> 01:08:21.569
And m must be negative in
order to satisfy this condition

01:08:21.569 --> 01:08:23.910
for this theory to work,
that the average score

01:08:23.910 --> 01:08:24.790
has to be negative.

01:08:24.790 --> 01:08:27.540
Clearly, you have to have
some negative scores.

01:08:27.540 --> 01:08:30.990
And the question then
is, should we use minus 1

01:08:30.990 --> 01:08:31.970
like we used before?

01:08:31.970 --> 01:08:37.580
Or should we use like minus 2
or minus 5, or something else?

01:08:37.580 --> 01:08:38.857
Any thoughts on this?

01:08:43.230 --> 01:08:43.979
Or does it matter?

01:08:43.979 --> 01:08:44.890
Maybe it doesn't matter.

01:08:44.890 --> 01:08:45.848
Yeah, what's your name?

01:08:45.848 --> 01:08:46.823
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:08:46.823 --> 01:08:49.769
Would it make sense to
not use [INAUDIBLE],

01:08:49.769 --> 01:08:52.229
because [INAUDIBLE].

01:08:52.229 --> 01:08:53.340
PROFESSOR: Yeah, OK.

01:08:53.340 --> 01:08:56.580
So you want to use a more
complicated scoring system.

01:08:56.580 --> 01:08:59.069
What particular
mismatches would you

01:08:59.069 --> 01:09:03.080
want to penalize more and less?

01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:09.424
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
I think [INAUDIBLE]

01:09:09.424 --> 01:09:10.888
needs to be [INAUDIBLE].

01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:23.886
PROFESSOR: Yeah, you are
correct in your intuition.

01:09:23.886 --> 01:09:25.260
Maybe one of the
biologists wants

01:09:25.260 --> 01:09:27.240
to offer a suggestion here.

01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:28.218
Yeah, go ahead.

01:09:28.218 --> 01:09:30.652
AUDIENCE: So it's a mismatch
between purine and pyrimidine

01:09:30.652 --> 01:09:31.152
[INAUDIBLE].

01:09:35.349 --> 01:09:37.640
PROFESSOR: OK so now we've
got purines and pyrimidines.

01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:39.840
So everyone
remember, the purines

01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:45.930
are A and G. The
pyrimidines are C and T.

01:09:45.930 --> 01:09:50.370
And the idea is that
this should be penalized,

01:09:50.370 --> 01:09:54.010
or this should be penalized
less than changing

01:09:54.010 --> 01:09:55.760
a purine to a pyrimidine.

01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:58.142
And why does that makes sense?

01:09:58.142 --> 01:09:59.950
AUDIENCE: Well,
structurally they're--

01:09:59.950 --> 01:10:02.260
PROFESSOR: Structurally, purines
are more similar to each other

01:10:02.260 --> 01:10:03.468
than they are to pyrimidines.

01:10:03.468 --> 01:10:04.820
And?

01:10:04.820 --> 01:10:07.997
More importantly, I think.

01:10:07.997 --> 01:10:08.538
In evolution?

01:10:12.452 --> 01:10:13.368
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:10:16.059 --> 01:10:17.684
PROFESSOR: I'm sorry,
can you speak up?

01:10:17.684 --> 01:10:20.044
AUDIENCE: C to C mutations
happen spontaneously

01:10:20.044 --> 01:10:21.215
in [INAUDIBLE] chemistry.

01:10:21.215 --> 01:10:21.840
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:24.810
So C to C mutations
happen spontaneously.

01:10:24.810 --> 01:10:27.440
So basically, it's
easier because they

01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:29.620
look more similar structurally.

01:10:29.620 --> 01:10:31.980
The DNA polymerase is more
likely to make a mistake

01:10:31.980 --> 01:10:33.970
and substitute another purine.

01:10:38.110 --> 01:10:43.940
The rate of purine,
purine or pyrimidine,

01:10:43.940 --> 01:10:46.470
pyrimidine to
transversions which

01:10:46.470 --> 01:10:48.970
switch the type is
about three to one,

01:10:48.970 --> 01:10:50.480
or two to one in
different systems.

01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:51.860
So yeah, that's a good idea.

01:10:51.860 --> 01:10:54.820
But for simplicity, just
to keep the math simple,

01:10:54.820 --> 01:10:57.139
we're just going to go
with one mismatch penalty.

01:10:57.139 --> 01:10:58.180
But that is a good point.

01:10:58.180 --> 01:11:00.470
In practice, you
might want to do that.

01:11:00.470 --> 01:11:02.820
So now, I'm saying
I'm going to limit you

01:11:02.820 --> 01:11:04.340
to one mismatch penalty.

01:11:04.340 --> 01:11:07.710
But I'm going to let you
choose any value you want.

01:11:07.710 --> 01:11:10.050
So what value should you choose?

01:11:10.050 --> 01:11:11.959
Or does it matter?

01:11:15.791 --> 01:11:18.414
Or maybe different applications?

01:11:18.414 --> 01:11:18.944
Tim, yeah?

01:11:18.944 --> 01:11:20.402
AUDIENCE: I've just
got a question.

01:11:20.402 --> 01:11:24.378
Does it depend on pi and ri?

01:11:24.378 --> 01:11:27.857
For example, we could
use all these numbers.

01:11:27.857 --> 01:11:30.342
But if the overall
wants to be negative,

01:11:30.342 --> 01:11:33.324
then you couldn't
use negative .1.

01:11:37.407 --> 01:11:38.990
PROFESSOR: Right,
that's a good point.

01:11:38.990 --> 01:11:42.030
You can't make it too weak.

01:11:42.030 --> 01:11:45.230
It may depend on what your
expected fraction of matches

01:11:45.230 --> 01:11:49.860
is, which actually
depends on pi and ri.

01:11:49.860 --> 01:11:55.210
So if you have very biased
sequences, like very AT rich,

01:11:55.210 --> 01:11:57.830
your expected fraction of
matches is actually higher.

01:11:57.830 --> 01:11:59.145
When you're researching
an AT rich sequence

01:11:59.145 --> 01:12:00.370
against another
AT rich sequence,

01:12:00.370 --> 01:12:01.869
it's actually higher
than a quarter.

01:12:04.300 --> 01:12:06.480
So even minus one might
not be sufficient there.

01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:08.260
You might need to go
down more negative.

01:12:08.260 --> 01:12:11.180
So you may need to use a
higher negative value just

01:12:11.180 --> 01:12:14.050
to make sure that the
expected value is negative.

01:12:14.050 --> 01:12:15.200
That's true.

01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:19.830
And yeah, you may want to adjust
it based on the composition.

01:12:19.830 --> 01:12:22.090
So let's just do a bit more.

01:12:22.090 --> 01:12:25.480
So it turns out that the
Karlin and Altschul theory,

01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:31.190
in addition to telling you what
the p value is of your match--

01:12:31.190 --> 01:12:34.280
the statistical significance--
it also tells you

01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:37.640
what the matches will
look like in terms

01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:41.460
of what fraction of
identity they will have.

01:12:41.460 --> 01:12:45.290
And this is the so-called
target frequency equation.

01:12:45.290 --> 01:12:48.940
The theory says that if
I search a query with one

01:12:48.940 --> 01:12:52.450
particular composition, p,
subject meta-composition r--

01:12:52.450 --> 01:12:54.840
here, I've just assumed
they're the same, both p just

01:12:54.840 --> 01:12:58.250
for simplicity-- with a
scoring matrix sij, which

01:12:58.250 --> 01:13:00.070
has a corresponding of lambda.

01:13:00.070 --> 01:13:03.080
Then, when I take those
very high scoring matches--

01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:05.780
the ones that are
statistically significant--

01:13:05.780 --> 01:13:10.650
and I look at those
alignments of those matches,

01:13:10.650 --> 01:13:15.650
I will get values qij,
given by this formula.

01:13:15.650 --> 01:13:17.110
So look at the formula.

01:13:17.110 --> 01:13:17.790
So it's qij.

01:13:17.790 --> 01:13:19.970
So pipj e to the lambda sij.

01:13:19.970 --> 01:13:22.620
So it's basically
the expected chance

01:13:22.620 --> 01:13:28.970
that you would have base
i matching based j just

01:13:28.970 --> 01:13:29.470
by chance.

01:13:29.470 --> 01:13:30.840
That's pipj.

01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:33.290
But then weighted by
e to the lambda sij.

01:13:33.290 --> 01:13:36.560
So we notice for a match,
s will be positive,

01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:38.060
so e to the lambda
will be positive.

01:13:38.060 --> 01:13:39.710
So that will be bigger than 1.

01:13:39.710 --> 01:13:41.340
And you'll have more
matches and you'll

01:13:41.340 --> 01:13:43.370
have correspondingly
less mismatches

01:13:43.370 --> 01:13:45.320
because the mismatch
has a negative.

01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:47.240
So get the target value score.

01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:52.510
And that also tells you that
the so-called natural scores

01:13:52.510 --> 01:13:56.540
are actually determined
by the fraction of matches

01:13:56.540 --> 01:13:59.500
that you want in your
high scoring segments.

01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:02.830
If we want 90% matches,
we just set qii

01:14:02.830 --> 01:14:06.180
to be 0.9, and use
this equation here.

01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:11.060
Solve for sij.

01:14:14.740 --> 01:14:18.620
For example, if you want to
find regions with R% identities.

01:14:18.620 --> 01:14:22.220
Little r is just the
r as a proportion.

01:14:22.220 --> 01:14:24.550
qii is going to be r over 4.

01:14:24.550 --> 01:14:27.110
This assumes unbiased
base composition.

01:14:27.110 --> 01:14:28.920
A quarter of the
matches are acgt.

01:14:32.060 --> 01:14:35.700
Qij, then, is 1 minus r over 12.

01:14:35.700 --> 01:14:38.750
1 minus r is a fraction
of non-matching positions.

01:14:38.750 --> 01:14:41.360
They're 12 different types.

01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:45.180
Set sii equal to 1, that's
what we said we normally do.

01:14:45.180 --> 01:14:48.560
And then you do a little
bit of algebra here.

01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:50.410
m is sij.

01:14:50.410 --> 01:14:54.730
And you sort of plug in
this equation twice here.

01:14:54.730 --> 01:14:56.740
And you get this equation.

01:14:56.740 --> 01:15:01.350
So it says that m equals
log of 4 1 minus r over 3

01:15:01.350 --> 01:15:03.010
over log 4 r.

01:15:03.010 --> 01:15:06.240
And for this to be
true, this assumes

01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:08.780
that both the query
and the database

01:15:08.780 --> 01:15:11.450
have uniform composition
of a quarter,

01:15:11.450 --> 01:15:16.300
and that r is between
a quarter and 1.

01:15:16.300 --> 01:15:19.294
The proportion of matches in
your high scoring segment--

01:15:19.294 --> 01:15:20.960
you want it to be
bigger than a quarter.

01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:23.014
A quarter is what you
would see by chance.

01:15:23.014 --> 01:15:25.430
There's something wrong with
your scoring system if you're

01:15:25.430 --> 01:15:27.390
considering those
to be significant.

01:15:27.390 --> 01:15:30.280
So it's something above 25%.

01:15:30.280 --> 01:15:35.090
And so it's just
simple algebra--

01:15:35.090 --> 01:15:41.180
you can check my work at
home-- to solve for m here.

01:15:41.180 --> 01:15:44.310
And then this equation
then tells you

01:15:44.310 --> 01:15:49.530
that if I want to find
75% identical matches

01:15:49.530 --> 01:15:51.340
in a nucleotide
search, I should use

01:15:51.340 --> 01:15:53.640
a mismatch penalty of minus 1.

01:15:53.640 --> 01:15:57.160
And if I want 99%
identical matches,

01:15:57.160 --> 01:16:00.200
I should use a
penalty of minus 3.

01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:02.440
Not minus 5, but minus 3.

01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:09.070
And I want you to think
about, does that make sense?

01:16:09.070 --> 01:16:11.640
Does that not make sense?

01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:14.400
Because I'm going to ask you
at the beginning of class

01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:17.950
on Tuesday to
explain and comment

01:16:17.950 --> 01:16:23.470
on this particular phenomenon
of how when you want higher

01:16:23.470 --> 01:16:31.340
percent identities, you want a
more negative mismatch score.

01:16:31.340 --> 01:16:35.410
Any last questions?

01:16:35.410 --> 01:16:36.960
Comments?
