00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:33.820
PROFESSOR: Well, welcome back to
computational systems biology.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.980
We're back here today talking
about genome assembly.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:43.150
How many people have ever
assembled a genome before?

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.050
In your spare time?

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.740
Anybody done any
genome assembly here?

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.330
One person?

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.590
I think genome assembly
is a fascinating topic.

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.830
And as you know, it's at the
bedrock of all modern biology.

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:59.750
We rely upon genome references
for almost everything in terms

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.690
of studying evolution, looking
at the structure of genes,

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.350
regulation of genes,
differences between individuals.

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.970
So it's really a very
fundamental concept.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.220
And we're going to talk today
about two different ways

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.450
of assembling genomes.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.290
And I think one of the takeaway
messages from today's lecture

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.200
is going to be that
genome assembly is more

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.740
of an art, in some
sense, than a science.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.320
And one has to always
be a little bit

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.310
suspicious of a
genome assembly given

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.300
what you're about
to learn today.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.920
And, of course, genome assembly
is becoming even more complex

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.700
because it used to be that
assembling the human genome

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.740
was the big task scientifically
in front of the community.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.230
But now there are billions
of genomes waiting

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:48.020
to be sequenced-- all the
individuals in the world

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.330
and to try and interpret them.

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:50.996
And now you can get
your genome sequence

00:01:50.996 --> 00:01:52.290
for between $5,000 and $10,000.

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.220
How many people here are tempted
to get their genome sequenced?

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.461
OK, I see about five
hands-- six hands.

00:02:00.461 --> 00:02:00.960
Great.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:07.950
So let's look at the science
behind genome assembly.

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.289
The basic concept
is that we're going

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:15.089
to collect some sequence
reads from the genome.

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:16.630
And we're going to
assemble them know

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.870
what are called contigs
for contiguous segments.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.827
And these represent
uninterrupted portions

00:02:22.827 --> 00:02:24.660
of the genome that are
completely covered by

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.485
reads that we believe
are contiguous.

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.730
These contigs then will be
paired together in scaffolds.

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.360
And scaffolds are like contigs
except that there are missing

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.560
parts between the
contigs in a scaffold.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.360
We don't know what
those parts are.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.710
But we're able to actually
glue them together

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:47.750
by using read pairs that allow
us to jump over the missing

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.870
parts because we have read
both ends of a molecule.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.190
But we don't know
what's in the middle.

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.730
And then oftentimes we had
physical mapping technologies

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.240
where we actually can go back
and assign location scaffolds

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.040
to physical locations
on chromosomes

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.260
by using PCR sequences
like sequence tag sites

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.980
that physically locate
a particular sequence

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.655
identity to a physical location
on a particular chromosome.

00:03:16.655 --> 00:03:19.804
And that provides us
with a total genome map.

00:03:19.804 --> 00:03:21.220
So today we're
going to be talking

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.440
about how to go from a
hard drive full sequence

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.505
reads all the way down
to a set of scaffolds

00:03:28.505 --> 00:03:31.820
that include assembled contigs.

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:35.560
And the way to think
about this once again

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.470
is that we start with
conceptually a single copy

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:39.230
of the genome.

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.250
We amplify this.

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:47.020
And in order to sequence it
on contemporary instruments,

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:48.470
we have to fragment it.

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.020
Now for those of you who were
in last Friday's recitation,

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.729
you heard Heng Li talking about
the idea that sequence reads

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:55.520
are getting longer.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.490
In fact, sequence
reads up to 10 to 15

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:59.630
kilobases are now possible.

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.687
And sequence reads
even longer than that

00:04:01.687 --> 00:04:03.520
are going to be possible,
which will greatly

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.636
simplify the assembly process.

00:04:05.636 --> 00:04:07.510
But for now we're talking
about the challenge

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.245
of assembling short reads--
say 100 base pair reads off

00:04:11.245 --> 00:04:14.400
of contemporary
sequencing instruments.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.529
So we take the fragmented
reads and the notion

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:20.250
is that we know
that they're going

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.696
to align up like a puzzle.

00:04:22.696 --> 00:04:24.070
And all we have
to do is line the

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.180
reads up to recover the read
sequence at the bottom--

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.424
the original genome sequence.

00:04:31.424 --> 00:04:33.840
And I should add that many of
the illustrations in today's

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:34.964
lecture are from Ben Lagmi.

00:04:34.964 --> 00:04:39.840
He was kind enough to allow me
to use them for today's talk.

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.860
So the goal is to come up with
that red sequence at the bottom

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.400
from the original set
of reads but, of course,

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.690
the read set that
we're talking about

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:53.680
is perhaps 200 million
reads or even a billion

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.970
reads as we'll see.

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.420
And so it's quite a tough task
to put pieces together given

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:02.170
that we really don't know
where they came from.

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:03.750
And we don't know
where they align

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:08.512
because we don't have
the red part to guide us.

00:05:08.512 --> 00:05:09.970
Now today we're
going to be talking

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.280
about what's called
de novo assembly.

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.490
That means starting
from scratch.

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.030
You hand me your set of reads
for your favorite organism.

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.572
And we're going to
assemble it today.

00:05:20.572 --> 00:05:22.030
That's different
than what's called

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.670
reference-guided
assembly because,

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:27.490
for example, if you're going
to re-sequence me or you,

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.660
there is a reference
human genome.

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:33.900
And it would be a simple matter
to take the reads from you or I

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.930
and map them back onto
the reference genome

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:40.050
as a guide to trying to
reassemble our genomes.

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.070
However, as you can
tell, if there's

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:44.280
a large structural variation
between the reference

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.500
genome and our genomes,
that process can fail.

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:53.230
So we're going to be talking
today about de novo assembly.

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:57.430
And in the process
of de novo assembly,

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.840
oftentimes we talk
about coverage,

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.570
which is on average how
many sequencing bases do

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:06.390
we have for every
base of the genome.

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:10.540
Here we have for this
little illustrative example

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:14.050
coverage of about 7x.

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:18.220
Now, at the origin of
the Human Genome Project,

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:20.710
some calculations were done
about how much coverage

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:23.670
was required to cover
the human genome.

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:28.980
And we talked last time
about library complexity.

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:30.670
This is a slightly
different idea,

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:33.020
which is we want to estimate
the probability the base is

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:34.830
uncovered.

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:37.810
So if we have the genome size
as G and the number of reads

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:40.090
as N and L is the
length of a read,

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:44.030
then N times L is the total
number bases that we have.

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:47.120
And that divided by the
genome is the average coverage

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:49.020
of a base.

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:52.240
And probably the probability
that a base is not covered

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:55.250
is the probability
we're going to observe

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:59.090
zero reads to that base,
which is e to the minus

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:04.330
lambda, roughly speaking, if
we use a Poisson approximation.

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:07.670
And therefore, the number of
uncovered bases it will have

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:12.630
is going to be roughly G
times e to the minus lambda.

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:15.640
The next calculations can
be thought intuitively

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:19.900
as the following way, which is
if we have N reads, if there's

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:21.540
going to be a gap
after a read, there

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:23.669
has to be an uncovered
base after it.

00:07:23.669 --> 00:07:26.210
And so the number of gaps we're
going to have in our assembly

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:30.360
is roughly N times e
to the minus lambda.

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:33.280
So this is a back of
the envelop calculation.

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:38.290
And now if we take some of
our 1,000 genomes data, which

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:42.820
we previously used and asked how
well this approximation works,

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:47.400
we see something like
this where the x-axis is

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:50.340
the total number of reads and
the genome coverage in bases

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:52.141
is shown on the y-axis.

00:07:52.141 --> 00:07:54.265
And these are all different
sequencing experiments.

00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:00.150
So you can see there the
roughly green outline,

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:04.630
which follows the approximately
what we saw before

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:06.137
in this Lander-Waterman rule.

00:08:06.137 --> 00:08:07.720
Could somebody tell
me what they think

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:10.290
is going on with the red lines
that actually don't match up

00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:11.200
with that green line?

00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:17.970
Anybody have any
ideas about why we

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:20.430
need more reads out
of those libraries

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:22.005
to get better coverage?

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:25.503
Yes?

00:08:25.503 --> 00:08:27.044
AUDIENCE: There is
probably some bias

00:08:27.044 --> 00:08:28.211
when you're amplifying them?

00:08:28.211 --> 00:08:29.585
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
there's probably

00:08:29.585 --> 00:08:32.179
skew in the original libraries
we talked about last time.

00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:34.289
In fact, we talked
about last time

00:08:34.289 --> 00:08:37.530
why the Poisson was not
a great approximation

00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:39.120
for looking at libraries.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:41.530
And in fact, we might
want to fit something

00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:44.850
like a negative binomial
in this particular case.

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:50.110
So we've got our read set.

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:52.270
And we can also
talk about coverage

00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:55.940
at a particular base, which is
different than average coverage

00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:58.600
just to be clear that there are
two different kinds of coverage

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.510
that one can think about.

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:05.590
Here we see coverage
at T of level six.

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:12.310
And the other thing that
we need to be cognizant of

00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:16.700
is that there are two
reasons that we might--

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:19.130
two common reasons why
we might actually see

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:23.310
reads that overlap but don't
agree at all positions.

00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:24.790
The obvious reason
is that there's

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:26.330
an error in one of the reads.

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:27.890
We get quality
scores and so forth.

00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:30.610
And that can help us
decide which is the truth.

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:34.330
But the other possibility
is that as you know,

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:36.800
you have one of each
of your chromosomes

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:39.077
from mom one from your dad.

00:09:39.077 --> 00:09:40.660
And there could be
allelic differences

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:41.743
between these chromosomes.

00:09:41.743 --> 00:09:44.810
So when we're doing
assembly, oftentimes we'll

00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:47.530
find that these
allelic differences are

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:53.230
going to pop up in terms of
non-concordance of our reads.

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:55.140
And we'll have to
ultimately decide

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:59.510
if we want to make a single
diploid approximation

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:03.130
of a human genome or
we want to attempt

00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:09.240
to assemble a diploid genome.

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:13.030
And if we're going to
do a diploid genome,

00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:15.250
then we have to be
quite careful and use

00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:18.560
somewhat different
assembly techniques.

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:20.760
But the common reference
genome is haploid.

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:24.500
It's only considering
one chromosomal sequence.

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:27.500
Is that clear to everybody?

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:29.900
OK, great.

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:33.980
So we're going to talk about two
general approaches to assembly

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:34.480
today.

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:38.990
We're going to talk about
overlap layout consensus

00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:43.520
assemblers as exemplified
by a string graph assembler.

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:45.820
And we're also going to
talk about De Bruijn graph

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:48.020
assemblers today.

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:52.850
Now, overlap
consensus assemblers

00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:55.760
were the first ones that
were used in the Human Genome

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:58.940
Project because reads
were longer back then.

00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:02.330
However, as the number
of reads has increased,

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:05.720
those assemblers are
more difficult to utilize

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:09.525
in part because of the need to
find overlaps between reads,

00:11:09.525 --> 00:11:12.239
as we'll see in a moment.

00:11:12.239 --> 00:11:13.780
Whereas to De Bruijn
graph assemblers

00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:15.910
are somewhat more efficient.

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:18.750
But they lose certain
kinds of information.

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:22.550
So let's begin with these
overlap layout consensus

00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:24.830
assemblers.

00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:30.720
And we're going to talk about
three steps to build contigs

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:33.000
and the scaffolding
step can be thought

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.490
of a similar between either
the overlap layout consensus

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:38.735
assemblers or De Bruijn
graph-based assemblers.

00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:45.220
So we're going to first
build an overlap graph.

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:47.420
What's an overlap graph?

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:49.870
The essential idea
is that when we

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:52.280
take our collection
of reads, we look

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:55.060
for overlaps between
the suffix of one read

00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:58.130
and the prefix of another read.

00:11:58.130 --> 00:12:00.040
And if we think of
all of our reads,

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:04.130
we want to build a graph that
describes all of such overlaps.

00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:06.090
And just to be
clear, I'm not going

00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:09.750
to be talking today about
the reverse complement

00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:11.580
of these reads.

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:14.400
Actual assemblers have
to represent that.

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.700
But it just duplicates
all the nodes at edges.

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:18.241
So we're going to
try and keep things

00:12:18.241 --> 00:12:21.330
uncluttered by-- that's OK.

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:23.030
Thank you.

00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:26.150
We're going to try and
keep things uncluttered

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:28.520
by not considering those today.

00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:36.480
Now, one of the
challenges is how

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:38.929
to construct those overlaps.

00:12:38.929 --> 00:12:40.970
And we're going to be
talking about graphs a lot.

00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:44.212
So I thought it was worthwhile
just to review terminology.

00:12:44.212 --> 00:12:46.670
We're going to represent overlap
graphs as directed graphs,

00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:48.980
which consists of a
set of vertices, which

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:52.020
are the objects represented by
the circles in the edges, which

00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:55.500
are the lines and a directed
edge goes from one vertex

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:56.000
to another.

00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:02.460
And there's also an
equivalent representation

00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:06.540
in notational form on the lower
part of the right of the slide

00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:08.790
as well as a graphical
representation.

00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:11.330
We're going to be using the
graphical representations

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:13.710
of these directed graphs today.

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:23.070
So the overlap graph is
simply a representation

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:25.520
of the overlap between reads.

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:30.340
And we pick a minimum
length of overlap at times.

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:34.640
But for the next few
slides, I'm simply

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:39.780
going to represent each
node as an individual read.

00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:42.310
And the edges will be
annotated with the amount

00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:45.190
of overlap between the reads.

00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:48.660
So if I hand you a set of
reads, all we need to do

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:51.130
is to compute this
overlap graph.

00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:53.930
We'll talk about how
to do that in a moment.

00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:58.500
And you'll see graphically
then what comes out

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:00.520
of the process of computing
the overlap graph.

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:08.700
Now, it's possible
that overlap graphs

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:14.250
are cyclic because there
are circular chromosomes.

00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:18.020
And as we'll see, it's also
possible to get a cyclic graph

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:21.600
out of a linear chromosome
if in fact there

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:25.450
are repetitive structures
in the chromosome that

00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:28.130
cause a graph to
cycle back on itself.

00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:37.770
So how to find overlaps
in efficient time

00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:39.230
is a key problem.

00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:41.990
And that's one of the reasons
that people have shied away

00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:44.430
from using these
types of assemblers

00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:48.130
is because the cost
of computing overlaps

00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:50.630
has been thought to be N-squared
where N is the number reads

00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:54.040
because you have to compare
all the reads to one another.

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:58.490
However, a really
clever algorithm

00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:01.630
was devised that
used the technology

00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:04.060
we talked about last time.

00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:09.330
You recall the idea of the FM
index and Burroughs-Wheeler

00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:16.240
transforms allowed us to index
a genome and then to look up

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:21.110
reads in time proportional
to the length of the read.

00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:22.730
So here's the essential idea.

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:26.540
What we're going to do is we're
going to take all of the reads

00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:28.480
that we collect.

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:29.730
And we're going to index them.

00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:36.480
And we can do that
roughly at N log N time.

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:39.640
And after we've indexed
all of the reads,

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:42.497
then we can use that same
index to find overlaps very,

00:15:42.497 --> 00:15:43.205
very efficiently.

00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:49.580
And you can conceptualize this
as simply looking at a read

00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:52.930
that you have in your hand and
looking it up in the index.

00:15:52.930 --> 00:15:54.960
And you'll find all the
places that the suffix

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:57.450
or prefix of that read batches.

00:15:57.450 --> 00:16:00.690
And you can trace back till you
find all the places it matches

00:16:00.690 --> 00:16:03.450
where they hit an end of a read.

00:16:03.450 --> 00:16:06.030
And those all correspond
to edges in the graph.

00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:08.640
And it turns out that
this is so clever

00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:12.450
that it eliminates
redundant edges.

00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:16.190
So, for example, if
I have reads that

00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:21.850
look like this where I have
read one overlaps with read

00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:27.050
two which overlaps
with read three.

00:16:27.050 --> 00:16:29.055
And read one and read
three also overlap.

00:16:32.003 --> 00:16:39.910
An unreduced graph would have
a representation like this.

00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:44.370
But it turns out
that we don't have

00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:50.630
to do that because we can
simply reduce our graph to this

00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:54.640
because we know that
read one and read three.

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:56.700
Actually, this is
the graph that we

00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:59.300
would have that
would be unreduced.

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:03.650
We can reduce the graph to
eliminate this transitive edge

00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:09.040
and simply represent
it in this fashion.

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:11.960
So when we use these
indices, we eliminate

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:14.595
these transitive edges
as we'll see momentarily.

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:22.260
So here's an example graph.

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:25.599
The sequence is
shown on the bottom.

00:17:25.599 --> 00:17:30.660
The read lengths are
of length seven bases.

00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:36.810
And we're going to consider all
overlaps a minimum size three.

00:17:36.810 --> 00:17:39.440
And the edge label
is the actual length

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:42.870
of the overlap
between the reads.

00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:46.660
And you can see
that at the outset

00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:50.310
that these overlap graphs
are not necessarily simple.

00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:52.430
That tracing a path
of the graph that

00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:57.030
represents the original
string is not completely

00:17:57.030 --> 00:17:58.690
and totally straightforward.

00:17:58.690 --> 00:18:03.970
So we need to come up with a
way to articulate our metrics

00:18:03.970 --> 00:18:08.060
for how to trace a path to the
graph to reconstruct a genome.

00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:15.310
And that comes to the
question of layout,

00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:19.760
which is how do we formulate
the problem of tracing

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:25.240
a path through an overlap graph?

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:29.050
So we'll first start with
the idea of the shortest

00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:32.170
common superstring.

00:18:32.170 --> 00:18:38.240
The shortest common
superstring of a string S

00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:42.600
is the shortest string that
contains all the strings in S

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:48.710
as substrings for a particular
length of substring.

00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:53.540
So, for example,
if we didn't have

00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:56.014
the constraint of
shortest, then just

00:18:56.014 --> 00:18:58.430
finding a string that contains
all the substrings is easy.

00:18:58.430 --> 00:19:01.540
You just put them all together.

00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:04.300
But if we want the
shortest, then we

00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:10.450
need to be more thoughtful
in terms of the way

00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:14.210
that we compute this
shortest common substring.

00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:16.530
And here is an example of
the shortest common substring

00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:22.700
for the substrings that I
have shown you up there.

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:25.060
So one way to think about
the assembly problem

00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:28.480
is that we're trying to compute
the shortest common substring

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:31.950
of all the reads that we have.

00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:35.420
And that will be the most
efficient representation

00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:37.015
of those reads in
a linear sequence.

00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:47.350
Now, we can describe
this problem

00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:49.807
in terms of an overlap graph.

00:19:49.807 --> 00:19:51.390
And if you think
about the way that we

00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:55.390
would solve this in overlap
graph, in the shortest strings,

00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:58.680
we want the maximum
amount of overlap.

00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:02.800
So we want to trace a path
through the overlap graph that

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:06.960
gives us the largest
amount of overlap,

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:08.920
which gives us the
shortest string.

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:10.000
Right?

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.680
So if we simply
negate the overlaps,

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:20.340
we want to minimize the
total cost of the graph.

00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:22.130
Now, it turns out
that this problem

00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:24.690
is known to be a very hard
computational problem.

00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:27.600
It's in the class of
something called NP-hard

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:30.296
because it's known as the
traveling salesman problem.

00:20:30.296 --> 00:20:31.670
And when you think
about the fact

00:20:31.670 --> 00:20:34.180
that we're going to have
hundreds of millions of reads,

00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:36.870
this is not really
going to be tractable.

00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:39.740
If we got rid of the
weights, and we simply

00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:42.309
wanted to find a path
through the graph,

00:20:42.309 --> 00:20:44.100
that's called the
Hamiltonian Path problem.

00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:46.880
That's also NP-complete.

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:50.020
So the shortest common
substring is a way

00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:53.390
to think about assembling.

00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:57.070
But we can't really
necessarily optimize metrics

00:20:57.070 --> 00:20:59.640
because it's going
to be intractable.

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:05.165
So think about ways of doing
this that are greedier.

00:21:05.165 --> 00:21:07.540
So here's an example of how
we would compute the shortest

00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:11.460
common substring starting
with the first string.

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:14.970
And each step along the
way, is a concatenation

00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:19.150
of strings or a
collapsing of strings that

00:21:19.150 --> 00:21:23.470
works towards building the
shortest common substring.

00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:29.490
And we get the input string
and the output string.

00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:32.620
So we could articulate
our assembly problem

00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:37.380
as a greedy SCS algorithm
to try and put all the

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:40.590
reads together to come
up with a superstring.

00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:49.800
And let me just describe to you
this will give us an intuition

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:52.960
into what goes wrong with
assembly in a moment.

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:55.580
But we do know there are
some bounds on this--

00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:58.330
that if we actually did
the greedy algorithm, then

00:21:58.330 --> 00:22:01.940
the assembly that we got would
be only two and a half times

00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:05.970
longer than the true
shortest common substring.

00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:08.340
That isn't really very
much comfort to us.

00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:10.590
So we're going to have to
come up with different, more

00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:12.714
heuristic ways of approaching
the assembly problem.

00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:17.710
Here is another example.

00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:20.480
Now, this is the one
that I want to show you

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:23.790
where we start with
a string at the top

00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:27.670
where we're going to be looking
for minimum overlaps of three

00:22:27.670 --> 00:22:32.530
and these are reads of six long.

00:22:32.530 --> 00:22:36.360
And when we do this
greedy algorithm,

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:40.620
we come up with a
string, which is shorter

00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:44.581
than the original beginning
string we started with.

00:22:44.581 --> 00:22:46.080
Can somebody see
what happened here?

00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:49.760
Why are we missing part
of the original string?

00:22:53.156 --> 00:22:53.656
Yes?

00:22:53.656 --> 00:22:55.239
AUDIENCE: The reads
were short enough.

00:22:55.239 --> 00:22:59.410
And they repeated enough
that we never found out

00:22:59.410 --> 00:23:02.510
that it was of the length
that it actually was.

00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:06.530
And so we just kind of
[INAUDIBLE] did it [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:06.530 --> 00:23:09.660
PROFESSOR: So the point
was that the reads were

00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:14.120
too short to be able to
unambiguously identify

00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:15.740
the number of repeats
of long that we

00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:18.860
had in the original sequence.

00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:20.090
That's absolutely correct.

00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:24.650
So we're not able to
disambiguate what was going on.

00:23:24.650 --> 00:23:29.832
And perhaps if we went
back to our graph formalism

00:23:29.832 --> 00:23:31.290
we could solve this
problem, right?

00:23:31.290 --> 00:23:34.640
Because here we have our
graph and the overlaps

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:38.410
are written in on the
edges of the number

00:23:38.410 --> 00:23:40.844
bases that each one of
these reads overlaps.

00:23:40.844 --> 00:23:43.010
And all we need to do is
to trace through this graph

00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:45.450
to find the original string.

00:23:45.450 --> 00:23:50.360
So here is one
tracing, which gives

00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:53.980
a total overlap of 39, which
actually faithfully reproduces

00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:57.680
the original string, right?

00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:02.150
However, that's not
the best tracing.

00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:05.810
A better tracing through this
graph or path through the graph

00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:09.900
would be this, which
gives us more overlap

00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:11.580
and gives us a shorter string.

00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:13.480
But as we know, even
though it's better

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:16.700
according to this metric,
it isn't really optimum

00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:19.560
because it gives us
the wrong answer.

00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:23.070
It's better but wrong.

00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:25.940
So we're going to have to take
into account other things when

00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:29.620
we do our assembly and
our tracing of this graph

00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:33.190
to be able to come up with
the best possible assembly.

00:24:35.730 --> 00:24:40.800
So if we increase
the read length

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:44.450
as was pointed out to
span appropriately,

00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:49.820
we will be able to reconstruct
the original sequence.

00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:53.414
And the point of this
example is that we

00:24:53.414 --> 00:24:55.830
need to consider this when
we're thinking about recovering

00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:58.570
repeat structures in genomes.

00:24:58.570 --> 00:25:04.850
So if we don't have
long enough reads,

00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:09.620
in this case reads
of length 8, we're

00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:12.600
not going to go to recover
the original repeat structure.

00:25:15.390 --> 00:25:20.270
And if we look at this,
repeats are really

00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:22.570
the bane of assemblers
in some sense.

00:25:22.570 --> 00:25:26.740
And as you know, roughly
50% of the human genome

00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:30.110
is repetitive content.

00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:34.620
So we need to be very, very
careful in terms of the way

00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:39.079
that we utilize reads to
be able to recover the best

00:25:39.079 --> 00:25:40.620
approximation of
our genome sequence.

00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:47.680
So here's another
example where we

00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:52.880
look at l is minimum
over length and k

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:55.360
is the length of the reads.

00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:57.500
And you can see the
sequence that we're

00:25:57.500 --> 00:25:59.333
trying to recover-- It
was the best of times

00:25:59.333 --> 00:26:03.800
it was the worst of
times and the output

00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:07.680
from our greedy SCS assembler.

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:10.620
And as you can see,
we need to get up

00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:15.080
to a read length of
13 characters for us

00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:18.475
to be able to properly assemble
that original sentence.

00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:25.390
So the essential message
here is that unless you

00:26:25.390 --> 00:26:29.860
have reads that are long
enough to span repeats,

00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:31.370
you're not going
to go to recover

00:26:31.370 --> 00:26:35.480
the original sequence exactly.

00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:41.410
And this can be also thought
of in the following example.

00:26:41.410 --> 00:26:45.650
Imagine you have repeats
that are tandem repeats out

00:26:45.650 --> 00:26:46.931
at the end of a sequence.

00:26:46.931 --> 00:26:48.430
And we're using the
English language

00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:51.604
here because it's easier
to see than if I put up

00:26:51.604 --> 00:26:52.770
a bunch of genomic sequence.

00:26:52.770 --> 00:26:56.330
But, of course, the
principles are the same.

00:26:56.330 --> 00:26:58.110
You can see that
unless we have reads

00:26:58.110 --> 00:27:01.680
that actually are anchored
and unique sequence

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:04.560
and span out towards
a repetitive sequence,

00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:08.535
we can't really tell
how many times the word

00:27:08.535 --> 00:27:09.285
bells is repeated.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.010
Another possibility
is that we can

00:27:14.010 --> 00:27:16.500
actually coming from both sides.

00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:20.450
And if we can anchor our reads
and unique sequence on both

00:27:20.450 --> 00:27:24.000
the left and the right side
of a repetitive element,

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.940
then we can figure out how many
copies of something like bells

00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:28.740
is present.

00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:30.860
But in the absence of that,
we really can't do it.

00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:34.020
In fact, we wind up with a
structure looks like this.

00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:39.900
We wind up with-- there
it is-- a structure where

00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:41.820
we have-- let's
just say that there

00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:45.300
are four different
stretches of genome

00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:47.430
in disparate parts
of chromosomes

00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:49.910
and we repeat sequence
in the middle.

00:27:49.910 --> 00:27:53.340
The blue parts of
the chromosomes

00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:54.700
are unique sequence.

00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:58.450
And the red parts are
repetitive sequences.

00:27:58.450 --> 00:28:02.770
What will happen is that if
the reads aren't long enough,

00:28:02.770 --> 00:28:06.580
we'll be able to find out in
each one of the four locations

00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:10.310
that we've gone from unique
sequence to repeat sequence.

00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:12.000
And then we will get
lost in the middle

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.030
of this identical
repeated sequence.

00:28:16.030 --> 00:28:18.059
And then on the
right-hand side we'll

00:28:18.059 --> 00:28:20.100
once again transition back
from repeated sequence

00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:21.470
to unique sequence.

00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:24.250
But we won't know how to put
things together in the middle.

00:28:24.250 --> 00:28:24.750
Right?

00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:26.208
We won't be able
to figure out what

00:28:26.208 --> 00:28:31.150
the path is through these
repetitive elements.

00:28:31.150 --> 00:28:36.500
So that's the essential point
I'd like to make about repeats.

00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:39.330
And we can now turn to
the question of layout

00:28:39.330 --> 00:28:44.760
and how to process an overlap
graph towards making contigs.

00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:48.650
This is the actual layout graph.

00:28:48.650 --> 00:28:51.940
When we think about
that sentence up there.

00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:55.270
And we say the minimum over
that length is four characters.

00:28:55.270 --> 00:28:58.750
And we have seven-character
reads out of the sequence.

00:28:58.750 --> 00:29:04.470
You can see it's a
pretty messy graph.

00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:09.220
If we clean up the graph by
removing the redundant edges,

00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:14.430
the edges like
this that span over

00:29:14.430 --> 00:29:17.450
reads and are implied
by other reads,

00:29:17.450 --> 00:29:20.690
we can remove edges that
are transitive over one

00:29:20.690 --> 00:29:22.210
reads or two reads.

00:29:22.210 --> 00:29:28.440
Now, my presentation
is going to talk

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:29.980
about how to remove these edges.

00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:31.960
However, as I said
at the outset,

00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:37.110
if you use the algorithm
by Simpson et al.,

00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:39.400
you actually don't generate
these transitive edges

00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:41.440
in the first place.

00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:43.760
But assuming that you
didn't use an algorithm

00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:45.410
and you did generate
them, you want

00:29:45.410 --> 00:29:49.480
to get rid of these
transitive edges like so.

00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:53.190
And it starts getting
somewhat simpler

00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:54.870
as you begin
simplifying the graph,

00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:58.030
removing these transitive edges.

00:29:58.030 --> 00:30:02.370
And then we can remove
edges that skip two nodes.

00:30:02.370 --> 00:30:05.210
So here's what happens after
you remove the single transitive

00:30:05.210 --> 00:30:06.140
edges in this graph.

00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:07.055
Yes?

00:30:07.055 --> 00:30:10.464
AUDIENCE: So it seems that the
transitive and verbal edges

00:30:10.464 --> 00:30:12.755
gave us a little bit more
information about the genome.

00:30:12.755 --> 00:30:18.124
Do we lose some useful
ordering principles by--

00:30:18.124 --> 00:30:20.040
PROFESSOR: They provide
redundant information.

00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:22.666
They don't really provide
any additional information.

00:30:22.666 --> 00:30:25.165
It's the same linear sequence
that's implied by those edges.

00:30:28.012 --> 00:30:28.845
Any other questions?

00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:37.820
So we can then remove
edges that span two nodes.

00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:41.450
And we get an even
simpler graph like this.

00:30:41.450 --> 00:30:43.900
Now this is beginning to look
more tractable because we

00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:48.270
can look at this and we
can output contigs that

00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:51.150
correspond to linear
portions of the graph, which

00:30:51.150 --> 00:30:53.370
should be linear sequence.

00:30:53.370 --> 00:31:00.590
And when we do that what we
wind up with are two contigs.

00:31:00.590 --> 00:31:03.400
And there's just a bit of
problem in the middle, which

00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:06.980
is that we're unable to
resolve the bit in the middle

00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:10.350
and as a consequence,
we know that that

00:31:10.350 --> 00:31:15.490
is the number of terms that
are in that original sentence

00:31:15.490 --> 00:31:17.550
because we didn't
have a read long

00:31:17.550 --> 00:31:21.670
enough to be able
to resolve that.

00:31:21.670 --> 00:31:24.390
The other problem
that we can have

00:31:24.390 --> 00:31:26.430
in doing this kind of
layout is that when

00:31:26.430 --> 00:31:30.120
there are portions of
the genome that occur

00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:34.200
or sequences in the genome that
occur multiple times, when we

00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:37.308
actually do this
layout, we may find

00:31:37.308 --> 00:31:38.807
that the portions
of the genome that

00:31:38.807 --> 00:31:42.990
occur in two disparate locations
line up with one another.

00:31:42.990 --> 00:31:45.470
And it may be that as you
exit the portion that's

00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:48.540
shared you get a
mismatched base.

00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:51.110
So that mismatch
could be because you

00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:53.400
have disparate parts of
the genome that actually

00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:54.944
have very similar sequence.

00:31:54.944 --> 00:31:56.360
Or it could be
that you had a read

00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:59.400
error at the end of your read.

00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:03.010
And it's difficult to tell the
two apart except by the amount

00:32:03.010 --> 00:32:05.190
of coverage that you have.

00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:06.690
We'll talk about
how to prune graphs

00:32:06.690 --> 00:32:09.930
like this in a few moments.

00:32:09.930 --> 00:32:14.420
But in any event, assuming
that we have pruned the graph,

00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:16.154
we have done our overlap.

00:32:16.154 --> 00:32:17.070
We've done our layout.

00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:19.950
We've found our paths to
the graph for our contigs.

00:32:19.950 --> 00:32:22.500
And then what we find
is that for each contig,

00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:24.810
we have many reads.

00:32:24.810 --> 00:32:26.990
And we're going to
take those reads.

00:32:26.990 --> 00:32:28.910
And we're going to look at them.

00:32:28.910 --> 00:32:30.950
And as you recall,
we could either

00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:34.100
have errors causing
disagreement among the reads.

00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:37.870
We could have allelic
differences between mom and dad

00:32:37.870 --> 00:32:41.270
causing those errors, well, not
really errors-- differences.

00:32:41.270 --> 00:32:43.810
And then we can take
a consensus to come up

00:32:43.810 --> 00:32:48.130
with what the haploid genome is.

00:32:48.130 --> 00:32:54.610
So that's the essential idea
of a overlap layout consensus

00:32:54.610 --> 00:32:55.480
assembler.

00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:58.590
We compute the overlap graph.

00:32:58.590 --> 00:33:01.170
During the layout phase we
actually simplify the graph.

00:33:01.170 --> 00:33:02.710
And we find pass through it.

00:33:02.710 --> 00:33:05.230
And during the consensus
phase, we take our reads,

00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:11.280
and we build a consensus
sequence of the genome.

00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:17.890
And as I said, this graph
building can be slow.

00:33:17.890 --> 00:33:19.746
Although, we'll
talk about how slow

00:33:19.746 --> 00:33:21.830
it is here in just a moment.

00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:25.440
And the challenge is that
modern sequencing data sets

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:28.820
are hundreds of
millions of reads.

00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:33.730
So let's talk about a
contemporary overlap-based

00:33:33.730 --> 00:33:36.680
assembler-- something called
the stream graph assembler,

00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:39.905
which is done over at
the Sanger in the UK.

00:33:39.905 --> 00:33:42.030
And there are three separate
steps it goes through.

00:33:42.030 --> 00:33:45.110
The first step is it
tries to correct reads.

00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:47.070
And the way it does
this is it actually

00:33:47.070 --> 00:33:50.340
looks at all the
k-mers that occur in

00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:53.470
reads-- it tries to find
sequences that are very, very

00:33:53.470 --> 00:33:57.090
rare and find sequences
that are nearby

00:33:57.090 --> 00:33:59.780
in sequence base
that aren't as rare.

00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:04.520
And it can correct bases that it
believes are sequencing errors.

00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:06.090
The next step is
assembly once it

00:34:06.090 --> 00:34:09.030
has taken all these
reads and corrected them.

00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:10.850
It indexes all the
reads as I suggested

00:34:10.850 --> 00:34:14.330
earlier using an FM index.

00:34:14.330 --> 00:34:18.790
And then it can find the overlap
from that FM index directly.

00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:22.170
And part of the assembly
process is throwing away

00:34:22.170 --> 00:34:23.639
duplicate reads
and throwing away

00:34:23.639 --> 00:34:26.250
reads that have
low quality scores.

00:34:26.250 --> 00:34:28.449
So that's the filtering step.

00:34:28.449 --> 00:34:34.860
It then has the set of
contigs that it has generated.

00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:36.500
And it does something
quite interesting

00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:39.429
to find the scaffolds is that
it takes the contigs it's

00:34:39.429 --> 00:34:42.860
assembled in terms
of linear sequence.

00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:45.790
And it completely re-indexes
them once again using

00:34:45.790 --> 00:34:47.394
an FM index.

00:34:47.394 --> 00:34:49.643
And then it takes all the
reads that you started with.

00:34:49.643 --> 00:34:53.770
And it maps them back
onto the contigs.

00:34:53.770 --> 00:34:57.100
And by mapping the paired
reads back on to the contigs,

00:34:57.100 --> 00:35:00.640
it can actually figure
out what contigs

00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:03.890
should be formed into scaffolds
where there are holes that

00:35:03.890 --> 00:35:07.960
are breached by
these longer reads.

00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:11.420
So it's using the FM indexed
both for correction to find out

00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:14.720
nearby k-mers for
assembly to find overlaps

00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:17.290
and for scaffolding to
put things together.

00:35:17.290 --> 00:35:22.119
And it does its indexing
three different times.

00:35:22.119 --> 00:35:24.160
And just to give you an
idea of how long it takes

00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:30.300
for a human-sized
genome, it's actually

00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:33.300
quite expensive in
terms of CPU time.

00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:36.150
It takes many days
have elapsed time

00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:41.610
to assemble an entire
human genome right now.

00:35:41.610 --> 00:35:45.860
And it's thousands of
CPU hours to actually put

00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:47.930
a genome together
starting from scratch.

00:35:50.590 --> 00:35:55.440
OK, so that's the essential idea
of an overlap-based assembler.

00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:58.780
Are there any questions at all
about overlap-based assemblers?

00:35:58.780 --> 00:35:59.643
Yeah?

00:35:59.643 --> 00:36:01.958
AUDIENCE: So in the
case of an error ,

00:36:01.958 --> 00:36:05.210
it's obvious how
you would call that.

00:36:05.210 --> 00:36:08.284
But in an allelic difference,
hypothetically, there

00:36:08.284 --> 00:36:11.067
would be 50% of the reads would
have one and 50% of the reads

00:36:11.067 --> 00:36:11.430
would have another.

00:36:11.430 --> 00:36:11.914
PROFESSOR: That's correct.

00:36:11.914 --> 00:36:14.590
AUDIENCE: So in that case
does it assemble-- do you

00:36:14.590 --> 00:36:17.400
just bias towards whichever
ones weren't easily amplified?

00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:21.960
Or do you assemble
two sequences?

00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:24.540
PROFESSOR: Most assemblers
produce a single sequence.

00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:29.750
And I don't know how SGA decides
between the different alleles

00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:32.710
because I don't recall what
the paper said they did.

00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:34.240
But they have to
essentially flip

00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:37.860
a coin to come up with
a haploid sequence.

00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:38.735
Yes?

00:36:38.735 --> 00:36:40.675
AUDIENCE: You said there was
three different times that you

00:36:40.675 --> 00:36:41.175
index.

00:36:41.175 --> 00:36:44.046
What are the three?

00:36:44.046 --> 00:36:45.420
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
the question was

00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:47.580
I said there are three
different they indexed.

00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:55.620
They indexed at the
outset to find errors.

00:36:55.620 --> 00:37:02.900
They indexed the second time
to do the overlap computation.

00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:06.070
And they indexed the
third time to realign

00:37:06.070 --> 00:37:09.740
all the original reads to the
contigs they have to figure out

00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:11.695
which contigs to put
together into scaffolds.

00:37:15.328 --> 00:37:16.260
Right?

00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:19.430
But they have this essential
foundational platform,

00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:21.490
which is the FM index.

00:37:21.490 --> 00:37:23.450
And so they use that
over and over again

00:37:23.450 --> 00:37:24.700
to be able to do the assembly.

00:37:28.045 --> 00:37:29.295
These are all great questions.

00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:35.295
All right, any other questions
about overlap-based assemblers.

00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:41.550
And you can see that if you
think about how much coverage

00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:43.800
they get out of an assembler
like this, it's actually,

00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:45.841
we'll compare all the
assemblers at the very end.

00:37:45.841 --> 00:37:50.730
But if you look at the
number of bases of autosomes

00:37:50.730 --> 00:37:57.000
and the X chromosome
covered by an assembly,

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.950
you can consider
that as a function

00:37:59.950 --> 00:38:04.180
of the minimum alignment
length to a referenced genome.

00:38:04.180 --> 00:38:07.830
And as the minimum
alignment length goes up,

00:38:07.830 --> 00:38:10.270
that means you have to match
longer and longer portions

00:38:10.270 --> 00:38:16.590
of the reference genome for
your assembly contig to count.

00:38:16.590 --> 00:38:19.126
You can see that the number
of bases dropped somewhat.

00:38:19.126 --> 00:38:20.500
In here they're
showing that they

00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:24.630
do better than another
assembler called SOAPdenovo.

00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:27.930
But they do get a
fairly good coverage.

00:38:27.930 --> 00:38:31.250
On the other hand,
they don't get coverage

00:38:31.250 --> 00:38:34.950
anywhere near as good as
Lander-Waterman might suggest

00:38:34.950 --> 00:38:36.637
because the coverage
should suggest

00:38:36.637 --> 00:38:38.470
that the probability
of uncovered base using

00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:42.700
Lander-Waterman would be roughly
e to the minus 40th-- something

00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:43.200
like that.

00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:46.600
And e to the minus 40th is like
4 times 10 to the minus 18.

00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:48.754
So they're not
anywhere near what

00:38:48.754 --> 00:38:50.670
we would think the
Lander-Waterman bound would

00:38:50.670 --> 00:38:52.350
be for assembly.

00:38:55.690 --> 00:38:59.810
So we've talked about these
overlap-based assemblers.

00:38:59.810 --> 00:39:02.950
Now I'm going to turn to
De Bruijn graph assemblers.

00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:05.490
How many people have heard
of De Bruijn graphs before?

00:39:05.490 --> 00:39:07.560
Anybody?

00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:11.210
One person?

00:39:11.210 --> 00:39:15.860
So before we talk about De
Bruijn graphs themselves,

00:39:15.860 --> 00:39:17.640
let's just talk terminology.

00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:23.415
So when I'm using
terms we're all

00:39:23.415 --> 00:39:27.550
on the same page where we were
talking about k-mers where

00:39:27.550 --> 00:39:32.080
the word mer is from
the Greek "part."

00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:34.380
And we talk about 4-mers
of an original sequence

00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:37.900
as a sequence that's
four bases long.

00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:40.570
And we can think about
all of the 3-mers

00:39:40.570 --> 00:39:43.080
of an original sequence.

00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:45.790
So we talk a lot about k-mers.

00:39:45.790 --> 00:39:51.620
And a k minus 1-mer is a
substring of length k minus 1

00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:52.855
obviously from a k-mer.

00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:58.670
So if we think about the
collection of reads--

00:39:58.670 --> 00:40:03.790
here these are our
super-simple economy sequencers

00:40:03.790 --> 00:40:06.360
producing reads of only
length three, which

00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:07.300
is pretty desperate.

00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:09.670
But at any rate we'll go
with that for the time being.

00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:12.750
And we think about
each one of these reads

00:40:12.750 --> 00:40:19.040
as having a left k minus 1-mer
and a right k minus 1-mer.

00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:22.960
We split them into
two halves that way.

00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:33.320
And we're going to build a
graph that is as follows.

00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:36.420
We're going to take all of the
k minus 1-mers-- in this case

00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:38.030
the 2-mers.

00:40:38.030 --> 00:40:40.850
And for each read,
we're going to draw

00:40:40.850 --> 00:40:46.340
an edge between its left
2-mer and its right 2-mer.

00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:49.690
OK, once again, for
each read, these sort

00:40:49.690 --> 00:40:51.890
of anemic,
three-base-pair reads,

00:40:51.890 --> 00:40:54.140
we're going to draw an
edge between its left 2-mer

00:40:54.140 --> 00:40:55.000
and its right 2-mer.

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:58.020
And they overlap in one base.

00:40:58.020 --> 00:41:02.100
So all of the graphs that are
De Bruijn graphs, the edges

00:41:02.100 --> 00:41:05.860
represent an
overlap of one base.

00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:07.330
OK?

00:41:07.330 --> 00:41:10.390
So if you look at the
graph at the bottom,

00:41:10.390 --> 00:41:15.140
that represents the
overlaps present

00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:17.650
in the original sequence.

00:41:17.650 --> 00:41:21.260
You note that we have
AA as one of the 2-mers.

00:41:21.260 --> 00:41:26.310
And its left half and right half
obviously overlap by one base.

00:41:26.310 --> 00:41:30.170
The triple-A read has
AA as its left read

00:41:30.170 --> 00:41:33.910
and AA as a right read--
thay overlap at one base.

00:41:33.910 --> 00:41:38.330
And that's why we have that
circular edge from A to itself.

00:41:38.330 --> 00:41:42.830
And the next edge
from AA to AB comes

00:41:42.830 --> 00:41:47.200
from the next
read-- the AAB read.

00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:56.640
So each edge then represents
an overlap of one base.

00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:59.330
And therefore, each
edge represents

00:41:59.330 --> 00:42:01.950
a unique k-mer sequence.

00:42:01.950 --> 00:42:04.690
So the way to think
about this graph

00:42:04.690 --> 00:42:08.970
is it that all of the edges
represent the original reads.

00:42:08.970 --> 00:42:13.340
And we have represented the
k minus 1 words as the nodes.

00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:16.150
OK?

00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:21.550
So we can take this graph
then and generalize this idea.

00:42:21.550 --> 00:42:27.440
And if we look at
how the graph changes

00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:29.850
as we add more
structure, here you

00:42:29.850 --> 00:42:31.840
see that we've added an extra b.

00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:35.530
And we get another edge in the
graph back to the same node.

00:42:35.530 --> 00:42:37.030
So when we're
building these graphs,

00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:40.245
if possible, we reuse a
node that already exists.

00:42:42.900 --> 00:42:46.320
Now the way to think
about coming back

00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:48.360
to the original sequence
is finding a path

00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:52.890
through this graph and emitting
sequence as we trace the path.

00:42:52.890 --> 00:42:54.680
And we would like
to have a path that

00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:58.130
traverses all of the nodes.

00:42:58.130 --> 00:43:01.180
And so we have some
definitions here,

00:43:01.180 --> 00:43:07.390
which is that a node is
balanced if its indegree equals

00:43:07.390 --> 00:43:09.400
it's outdegree.

00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:13.960
And you can see that not all
the nodes are balanced down

00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:16.660
the graph of the lower,
right-hand corner.

00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:18.720
And it's connected
if all the components

00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:20.970
or nodes can be reached.

00:43:20.970 --> 00:43:25.650
And a Eulerian walk visit
each edge exactly once,

00:43:25.650 --> 00:43:30.690
which is what we would like to
actually take a De Bruijn graph

00:43:30.690 --> 00:43:34.750
and emit a genome sequence.

00:43:34.750 --> 00:43:37.130
Now, not all graphs
have these walks.

00:43:40.010 --> 00:43:42.290
And graphs do our Eulerian.

00:43:42.290 --> 00:43:47.520
And we won't distinguish
different types

00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:50.430
of these graphs.

00:43:50.430 --> 00:43:54.379
And if a graph has two
semi-balanced nodes

00:43:54.379 --> 00:43:56.170
and all the rest of
the nodes are balanced,

00:43:56.170 --> 00:43:59.650
then it will have
a walk through it.

00:43:59.650 --> 00:44:04.990
So if we think about
our original graph,

00:44:04.990 --> 00:44:09.360
there are two arguments
for it having such a walk.

00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:14.120
The first argument is
that we show the walk.

00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:18.730
And the second is that we
have two semi-balanced nodes

00:44:18.730 --> 00:44:20.355
and the rest of the
nodes are balanced.

00:44:23.620 --> 00:44:26.340
So the reason that
we care about this

00:44:26.340 --> 00:44:30.100
is that we want to study
cases where this goes wrong.

00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:37.800
So to build a De Bruijn
graph of a genome,

00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:42.120
we're going to take our
original sequence reads.

00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:45.570
And we're going to take
all the k-mers that

00:44:45.570 --> 00:44:48.570
occur in those reads.

00:44:48.570 --> 00:44:53.230
And we're going to add
edges to a De Bruijn graph

00:44:53.230 --> 00:44:54.310
based upon those k-mers.

00:44:54.310 --> 00:45:04.530
So if we have a read like
this, and we consider

00:45:04.530 --> 00:45:07.660
a k-mer in the read,
we're going to add an edge

00:45:07.660 --> 00:45:11.070
in the graph between
the left k minus 1-mer

00:45:11.070 --> 00:45:14.250
and the right k minus 1-mer.

00:45:14.250 --> 00:45:18.440
And we'll do that for every
single k-mer in the read.

00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:22.230
Now note what this does is
it destroys some information.

00:45:22.230 --> 00:45:26.230
It destroys information
about the ordering

00:45:26.230 --> 00:45:30.230
of certain of the k-mers in this
read just destroying their read

00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:34.400
contiguity in order to make
some simplifying assumptions

00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:39.360
to represent the
sequence ordering

00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:43.940
of these k minus
1-mers in the graph.

00:45:43.940 --> 00:45:48.910
So we build the
graph in this way

00:45:48.910 --> 00:45:56.120
and if I were to build
the graph like this,

00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:59.370
what is the minimum
sequence overlap for two

00:45:59.370 --> 00:46:02.420
reads to actually share an
edge in the resulting graph?

00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:08.720
Can anybody see how
long the sequence

00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:10.210
must be in the
second read for it

00:46:10.210 --> 00:46:13.270
to actually overlap at
edge with the first read?

00:46:20.570 --> 00:46:23.000
Well, if this second read
also has a k-mer, right?

00:46:25.684 --> 00:46:28.100
It's going to produce another
structure just like this one

00:46:28.100 --> 00:46:30.480
if these two do overlap.

00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:34.180
And thus the edge produced
by this read and the edge

00:46:34.180 --> 00:46:39.520
by this read will
overlap like this.

00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:47.750
And thus all of the nodes that
came from this part of read one

00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:49.470
will feed into this graph.

00:46:49.470 --> 00:46:51.110
And then all the
nodes to come out

00:46:51.110 --> 00:46:54.640
of this k-mer from the
purple read will come out

00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:57.030
of it like so, right?

00:46:57.030 --> 00:46:59.320
And thus when we're
tracing the graph,

00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:01.410
the idea is that the
graph will be connected.

00:47:01.410 --> 00:47:03.500
And we'll be able to
come between these reads

00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:05.912
and reconstruct
the sequence that

00:47:05.912 --> 00:47:07.120
was suggested by the overlap.

00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:15.120
The thing, however, you should
note in this-- yes, question?

00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:18.960
AUDIENCE: So you're
picking two k minus 1

00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:22.970
reads there-- are those
from different reads?

00:47:22.970 --> 00:47:24.464
Or from the white read?

00:47:24.464 --> 00:47:26.130
PROFESSOR: No, it's
from the white read.

00:47:26.130 --> 00:47:30.550
These are the 2k minus 1-mers
that came out of this read.

00:47:30.550 --> 00:47:32.185
So they actually overlap.

00:47:32.185 --> 00:47:34.560
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
but then you were

00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:38.401
talking about how the one
was purple in that case.

00:47:38.401 --> 00:47:40.900
PROFESSOR: Right, well, this
is the same sequence let's say.

00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:44.420
This is the same, exact
sequence down here.

00:47:44.420 --> 00:47:47.990
So if it's the same,
exact sequence,

00:47:47.990 --> 00:47:50.930
it will have the
same k minus 1-mers.

00:47:50.930 --> 00:47:54.230
And when we build the graph
if a node already exists,

00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:55.100
we reuse it.

00:47:58.430 --> 00:48:01.280
And thus if we
reuse the nodes that

00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:04.850
were created when we
built the graph nodes

00:48:04.850 --> 00:48:09.450
and edges for the white read,
then when the purple read comes

00:48:09.450 --> 00:48:11.700
along, we're going to
put another edge here

00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:14.370
between these two k minus 1-mers
because they are contained here

00:48:14.370 --> 00:48:16.594
as well.

00:48:16.594 --> 00:48:18.260
So these are identical
sequences to this

00:48:18.260 --> 00:48:21.430
because these two reads overlap.

00:48:21.430 --> 00:48:23.800
And this part is the same
sequence as that part.

00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:26.280
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so why do
you need k minus 1-mers

00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:30.250
if you have overlapped k?

00:48:30.250 --> 00:48:31.990
PROFESSOR: Because
the way we're finding

00:48:31.990 --> 00:48:35.260
these overlaps is
through the graph.

00:48:35.260 --> 00:48:39.654
And we're not indexing
things of size k, right?

00:48:39.654 --> 00:48:41.320
We're indexing things
of size k minus 1.

00:48:47.130 --> 00:48:55.502
In each edge represents
a sequence of length k

00:48:55.502 --> 00:48:57.460
because we know this
sequence and this sequence

00:48:57.460 --> 00:48:59.320
are overlapped by one base.

00:49:02.150 --> 00:49:04.940
So when we find an edge that's
the same between the white

00:49:04.940 --> 00:49:07.150
and the purple read,
we know that they're

00:49:07.150 --> 00:49:08.370
overlapping by k bases.

00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:13.019
Is that making sense to you?

00:49:13.019 --> 00:49:13.560
AUDIENCE: No.

00:49:13.560 --> 00:49:17.928
PROFESSOR: No, OK, so
let's try it again.

00:49:17.928 --> 00:49:19.136
AUDIENCE: You can keep going.

00:49:19.136 --> 00:49:20.094
PROFESSOR: No, it's OK.

00:49:24.140 --> 00:49:27.580
Let's just start with the purple
read to start for a moment

00:49:27.580 --> 00:49:29.570
because I think if
you have a question,

00:49:29.570 --> 00:49:31.500
other people may
have a question.

00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:38.220
So we have this sequence, which
is this sequence right here,

00:49:38.220 --> 00:49:39.050
right?

00:49:39.050 --> 00:49:41.600
And then we have
this sequence, which

00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:44.070
is the sequence right here.

00:49:44.070 --> 00:49:47.170
They overlap by one base.

00:49:47.170 --> 00:49:50.100
And so we put an edge between
them like this in the graph.

00:49:50.100 --> 00:49:50.600
OK?

00:49:53.380 --> 00:49:56.235
AUDIENCE: Don't they overlap
by more than one base?

00:49:56.235 --> 00:50:00.805
They can only contain
one base from each k-mer.

00:50:00.805 --> 00:50:01.680
PROFESSOR: I'm sorry.

00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:02.665
That's what I meant.

00:50:02.665 --> 00:50:03.165
Yeah.

00:50:06.210 --> 00:50:12.070
And then the same thing
is true down here.

00:50:15.730 --> 00:50:20.969
And so we will find this k minus
1-mer and this k minus 1-mer.

00:50:20.969 --> 00:50:21.885
And then they overlap.

00:50:39.350 --> 00:50:46.920
For genome assembly, we
record the forward and reverse

00:50:46.920 --> 00:50:48.980
complement reads in twin nodes.

00:50:48.980 --> 00:50:51.920
And we're not going to
show those because it just

00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:53.540
complicates our
graphs without really

00:50:53.540 --> 00:50:56.690
adding any illustrative power.

00:50:56.690 --> 00:50:59.854
And we always choose k to
be odd so that a node can't

00:50:59.854 --> 00:51:01.145
be its own reversed complement.

00:51:07.210 --> 00:51:19.200
And here is the graph growing
if we think about k equals 5.

00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:21.360
So we have reads of length five.

00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:25.910
And we are adding
sequences to the graph.

00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:28.290
And you note that
the graph is acyclic

00:51:28.290 --> 00:51:30.390
until we get to the
repeated sequence.

00:51:30.390 --> 00:51:34.000
And we get to the second long
the sequence comes back around

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:37.060
begins a looping back on itself.

00:51:37.060 --> 00:51:42.660
And if we consider the last
part of this De Bruijn graph

00:51:42.660 --> 00:51:47.170
construction, then we wind
up with the finished graph

00:51:47.170 --> 00:51:48.860
on the right-hand side.

00:51:48.860 --> 00:51:51.930
And you can see the
multiplicity of the edges

00:51:51.930 --> 00:51:53.640
correspond to the
number of times

00:51:53.640 --> 00:51:55.665
the long is repeated
in this graph.

00:51:58.550 --> 00:52:03.370
So once again, repeats are
causing the circular structure,

00:52:03.370 --> 00:52:06.460
which only could be resolved if
we had sufficiently long reads,

00:52:06.460 --> 00:52:08.465
which we don't have in
this particular case.

00:52:12.830 --> 00:52:15.920
However, if we consider
perfect sequencing

00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:18.800
we always have a
path to the graph.

00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:25.750
And the reason is
that the leftmost part

00:52:25.750 --> 00:52:31.040
of the genome, so to speak,
is going to be semi-balanced.

00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:33.370
And the rightmost part is
going to be semi-balanced.

00:52:33.370 --> 00:52:38.350
And all the parts in between
are going to be balanced.

00:52:38.350 --> 00:52:42.190
So the k minus 1-mer on the
very left end is semi-balanced

00:52:42.190 --> 00:52:45.650
and the k minus 1-mer on
the right is semi-balanced.

00:52:45.650 --> 00:52:50.220
And all the nodes in
between are balanced.

00:52:50.220 --> 00:52:55.470
Now, this does not allow
for errors of course.

00:52:55.470 --> 00:53:04.320
And we talk about following
this Eulerian walk

00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:06.349
to find the original sequence.

00:53:06.349 --> 00:53:08.640
But the question we can ask
ourselves is whether or not

00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:10.430
this walk always
really corresponds

00:53:10.430 --> 00:53:13.250
to the original genome sequence.

00:53:13.250 --> 00:53:16.010
It turns out I can show
you this example, which

00:53:16.010 --> 00:53:20.200
is we have this graph
for this sequence.

00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:25.040
And there are two different
walks through this graph.

00:53:25.040 --> 00:53:31.070
And the two different
walks produced

00:53:31.070 --> 00:53:32.630
two different sequences.

00:53:32.630 --> 00:53:35.080
And they depend
upon which way you

00:53:35.080 --> 00:53:39.580
start walking from the node AB.

00:53:39.580 --> 00:53:43.620
So once again, here we
have seen that even when

00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:48.480
we have a path to the graph,
the path may not be unique.

00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:51.290
It may not be able to
generate the original sequence

00:53:51.290 --> 00:53:52.170
that we started with.

00:53:55.750 --> 00:54:01.670
So the other problem
we can have when

00:54:01.670 --> 00:54:04.960
we are building a graph like
this is that gaps in coverage

00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:07.810
can create holes in the graph.

00:54:07.810 --> 00:54:11.970
So if we omit
certain of our reads,

00:54:11.970 --> 00:54:16.640
we'll come up with a graph
that is broken into two parts.

00:54:16.640 --> 00:54:18.660
And this corresponds
to the idea that we're

00:54:18.660 --> 00:54:22.660
going to create two different
contigs that are contiguous

00:54:22.660 --> 00:54:25.720
sequence but will be unable
to fill in the middle part.

00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:26.220
OK?

00:54:29.370 --> 00:54:39.140
So we also can have differences
in coverage of a graph

00:54:39.140 --> 00:54:44.480
when we have extra reads
at particular locations

00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:45.710
in the genome.

00:54:45.710 --> 00:54:51.030
And that causes the degrees on
the individual nodes to vary

00:54:51.030 --> 00:54:56.560
and causes us to not be able
to rely upon the indegree

00:54:56.560 --> 00:55:00.629
and outdegree as an
absolute metric for how

00:55:00.629 --> 00:55:02.045
to trace a path
through the graph.

00:55:07.470 --> 00:55:12.544
And the other thing is that
if you have differences

00:55:12.544 --> 00:55:14.460
between the chromosomes,
which we talked about

00:55:14.460 --> 00:55:20.450
last time in our overlap
layout consensus assembler,

00:55:20.450 --> 00:55:25.150
it also can cause
graphs to split apart

00:55:25.150 --> 00:55:27.120
and to have subgraphs
that correspond

00:55:27.120 --> 00:55:31.020
to one allele versus the
other allele, which is present

00:55:31.020 --> 00:55:33.760
perhaps in the main graph.

00:55:33.760 --> 00:55:40.000
All right, so it's
actually the case

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:45.710
that these graphs are attractive
for a very important reason,

00:55:45.710 --> 00:55:48.180
which is there extraordinarily
efficient to build.

00:55:48.180 --> 00:55:51.600
That is in order to
build a graph like this,

00:55:51.600 --> 00:55:54.420
you need to take each one
of these k minus 1-mers

00:55:54.420 --> 00:55:57.517
and actually find the node,
which you can do by hashing

00:55:57.517 --> 00:55:59.100
and then put the
edges into the graph.

00:55:59.100 --> 00:56:02.870
And so you find that you need
to put in an edge and two nodes

00:56:02.870 --> 00:56:05.210
for each k-mer.

00:56:05.210 --> 00:56:08.810
And if you have a hash map that
encoded these nodes and edges,

00:56:08.810 --> 00:56:11.460
it's constant time work.

00:56:11.460 --> 00:56:14.660
So you wind up
with a graph which

00:56:14.660 --> 00:56:18.330
costs order of the
number of reads to build.

00:56:18.330 --> 00:56:21.620
So it's a linear time
graph construction problem.

00:56:21.620 --> 00:56:26.510
Recall that our last
overlap construction,

00:56:26.510 --> 00:56:30.130
we thought we could
get down to N log N.

00:56:30.130 --> 00:56:34.430
And here is an example of
sub-setting part of the lambda

00:56:34.430 --> 00:56:38.840
phage genome using a De
Bruijn graph assembler.

00:56:38.840 --> 00:56:40.850
And you can see that
roughly the time required

00:56:40.850 --> 00:56:43.085
to assemble parts
of the genome is

00:56:43.085 --> 00:56:45.460
linear in the amount of genome
sequence that you give it.

00:56:50.460 --> 00:56:59.290
So these assemblers were
favored early on in the days

00:56:59.290 --> 00:57:03.040
of short-read assembly in part
because they were so efficient.

00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:05.395
And typically in
some of the projects,

00:57:05.395 --> 00:57:06.747
you have very high coverage.

00:57:06.747 --> 00:57:08.580
And so you wind up with
graphs that actually

00:57:08.580 --> 00:57:11.980
have a huge number of
edges between nodes.

00:57:11.980 --> 00:57:15.300
And this can be
summarised in terms

00:57:15.300 --> 00:57:17.530
of a graph that simply
annotates the edges

00:57:17.530 --> 00:57:21.750
with the number of instances.

00:57:21.750 --> 00:57:25.920
And so you have a weighted graph
on the right-hand side, which

00:57:25.920 --> 00:57:31.660
is easier in some sense to
trace because we can now

00:57:31.660 --> 00:57:36.745
begin to eliminate low-coverage
edges as potential anomalies.

00:57:40.740 --> 00:57:43.780
But the essential idea is to
trace these graphs to produce

00:57:43.780 --> 00:57:45.840
the ultimate genome sequence.

00:57:45.840 --> 00:57:48.480
And in order to
do so, we may need

00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:51.550
to do some error correction.

00:57:51.550 --> 00:57:56.570
So we talked earlier about the
idea that if we have an error,

00:57:56.570 --> 00:58:00.060
we're going to actually produce
a portion of the graph that

00:58:00.060 --> 00:58:03.540
hangs off into outer space.

00:58:03.540 --> 00:58:07.910
And we can cut these
dead-end tips of the graph

00:58:07.910 --> 00:58:13.060
off if they are low coverage
because they presumably

00:58:13.060 --> 00:58:15.740
correspond to errors.

00:58:15.740 --> 00:58:19.540
If we get an error in
the middle of a read,

00:58:19.540 --> 00:58:22.860
we can wind up with a so-called
bubble in the graph, which

00:58:22.860 --> 00:58:25.300
once again is low coverage.

00:58:25.300 --> 00:58:31.800
And we can get rid of these
bubbles in a similar fashion.

00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:36.650
And it's also possible to get
chimeric edges of the graph.

00:58:36.650 --> 00:58:39.730
And those can be caused
by errors as well.

00:58:39.730 --> 00:58:43.591
And we can clip those edges.

00:58:43.591 --> 00:58:45.590
So there are different
kinds of error correction

00:58:45.590 --> 00:58:46.548
we can do in the graph.

00:58:46.548 --> 00:58:48.280
These are all quite heuristic.

00:58:48.280 --> 00:58:51.030
Each assembler has its
own set of heuristics

00:58:51.030 --> 00:58:54.370
for how to deal
with graph anomalies

00:58:54.370 --> 00:59:01.890
and how to eliminate edges in
the graph to permit assembly.

00:59:01.890 --> 00:59:05.880
But these are getting
rid of dead-end tips

00:59:05.880 --> 00:59:08.630
and popping bubbles and
getting rid of chimeric edges

00:59:08.630 --> 00:59:11.240
are important things to
consider for any assembler.

00:59:14.800 --> 00:59:18.160
So the limitations
of these graphs

00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:20.770
are the idea that
we're immediately

00:59:20.770 --> 00:59:26.640
splitting these reads into this
k-mer representation, which

00:59:26.640 --> 00:59:29.210
is destroying information.

00:59:29.210 --> 00:59:33.460
And in order to
overcome this, one

00:59:33.460 --> 00:59:36.170
of the things that people have
done in these De Bruijn graph

00:59:36.170 --> 00:59:42.520
assemblers is to take
the original reads

00:59:42.520 --> 00:59:45.380
and to map them back
on to the graph.

00:59:45.380 --> 00:59:46.955
So when you're
attempting to trace

00:59:46.955 --> 00:59:48.580
the path through the
graph, what you do

00:59:48.580 --> 00:59:49.871
is you take the original reads.

00:59:49.871 --> 00:59:52.102
You thread them
through the graph.

00:59:52.102 --> 00:59:53.560
And you know that
the original read

00:59:53.560 --> 00:59:56.390
represents contiguous
genome sequence.

00:59:56.390 --> 00:59:58.470
So it provides you with
a path through the graph

00:59:58.470 --> 00:59:59.520
that you know is good.

01:00:02.430 --> 01:00:05.100
People have been
doing this in part

01:00:05.100 --> 01:00:08.380
because they didn't want to
go to the full overlap graph

01:00:08.380 --> 01:00:10.890
implementation
because of the cost.

01:00:10.890 --> 01:00:15.140
But I think that these overlap
graph implementations now

01:00:15.140 --> 01:00:18.230
are sufficiently sophisticated
that I personally

01:00:18.230 --> 01:00:20.710
would use them instead of a
De Bruijn graph assembler.

01:00:23.610 --> 01:00:29.580
And so the trade off
really centers around

01:00:29.580 --> 01:00:36.070
speed and space versus accuracy.

01:00:36.070 --> 01:00:42.400
So we can look at some
example assemblers

01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:45.210
and look at their performance.

01:00:45.210 --> 01:00:48.444
But before I do that and
we leave De Bruijn graphs,

01:00:48.444 --> 01:00:50.610
are there any other questions
about De Bruijin graph

01:00:50.610 --> 01:00:51.110
assemblers?

01:00:53.570 --> 01:00:54.480
AUDIENCE: I have one.

01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:55.563
PROFESSOR: Yeah, question.

01:00:55.563 --> 01:00:57.340
AUDIENCE: How long
is k typically?

01:00:57.340 --> 01:00:59.090
PROFESSOR: We're going
to talk about that.

01:00:59.090 --> 01:01:04.260
The k typically is somewhere
around 60-- something

01:01:04.260 --> 01:01:08.834
like that-- Somewhere
in that neighborhood.

01:01:08.834 --> 01:01:10.500
It's actually-- it
has to be odd, right?

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:14.340
So 61, 57-- something like that.

01:01:14.340 --> 01:01:15.050
Good question.

01:01:15.050 --> 01:01:17.585
Any other questions about
De Bruijin graph assemblers?

01:01:25.150 --> 01:01:32.670
So once again returning
to over our architecture,

01:01:32.670 --> 01:01:34.230
we have these reads.

01:01:34.230 --> 01:01:37.310
We need to produce contigs.

01:01:37.310 --> 01:01:40.430
In the case of
overlap graphs, we're

01:01:40.430 --> 01:01:42.130
going to trace the
overlap graphs.

01:01:42.130 --> 01:01:43.825
In the case of De
Bruijn graphs, we're

01:01:43.825 --> 01:01:45.283
going to trace the
De Bruijn graph.

01:01:45.283 --> 01:01:49.980
For scaffolding, we can use
the read pairs to put scaffolds

01:01:49.980 --> 01:01:52.340
back together again.

01:01:52.340 --> 01:01:57.540
And here is some comparison
of the performance

01:01:57.540 --> 01:01:59.290
of these various assemblers.

01:01:59.290 --> 01:02:05.640
So the first assembler--
SGA-- is an overlap layout

01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:08.280
consensus-style assembler.

01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:11.160
Velvet/Abyss and SOAPdenovo
are all De Bruijn,

01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:12.274
graph-based assemblers.

01:02:12.274 --> 01:02:13.940
So these are all
contemporary assemblers

01:02:13.940 --> 01:02:17.190
that people use for
assembling genomes.

01:02:17.190 --> 01:02:18.870
An important metric
for assemblers

01:02:18.870 --> 01:02:22.560
is something called N50,
which is the size of a contig

01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:28.740
or scaffold where at that length
or larger 50% of the bases

01:02:28.740 --> 01:02:31.600
are present in scaffolds
of that length.

01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:36.340
So, for example, for SGA, they
say that scaffold N50 size

01:02:36.340 --> 01:02:41.390
is 26.3 kilobases, which
means that in scaffolds

01:02:41.390 --> 01:02:44.790
of length 26.3
kilobases or larger,

01:02:44.790 --> 01:02:47.760
half of the bases
of the assembly lie.

01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:52.700
So the larger the N50 is,
the larger the scaffolds

01:02:52.700 --> 01:02:54.670
are that cover things.

01:02:54.670 --> 01:02:58.090
And you want larger and
larger scaffolds or contigs

01:02:58.090 --> 01:03:01.290
so that you have fewer
gaps in your assembly.

01:03:01.290 --> 01:03:07.350
So the N50 number is a
principle comparison metric

01:03:07.350 --> 01:03:10.510
when one is thinking
about assemblers.

01:03:10.510 --> 01:03:16.540
So in this particular case,
for SGA the overlap metric

01:03:16.540 --> 01:03:21.480
was that the reads had to
overlap by at least 75 bases

01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:23.300
or more.

01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:25.100
And these were
100-base pair reads.

01:03:25.100 --> 01:03:26.690
You can see the
details on the read

01:03:26.690 --> 01:03:29.260
data on the bottom line there.

01:03:29.260 --> 01:03:32.790
So as long as the reads
overlap by 75 bases,

01:03:32.790 --> 01:03:35.840
they were put
together in the graph.

01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:37.650
And the De Bruijn
graph assemblers

01:03:37.650 --> 01:03:43.590
each had their own
optimum number for k.

01:03:43.590 --> 01:03:46.050
And the way that you tune
these parameters is you

01:03:46.050 --> 01:03:50.040
run the assembler on
a range of k values.

01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:56.290
And you see which k value
produced the assembly

01:03:56.290 --> 01:03:59.280
with the highest N50.

01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:02.060
And you pick that k.

01:04:02.060 --> 01:04:04.120
Can anybody think
of a reason why

01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:06.290
it is that although
these are all

01:04:06.290 --> 01:04:09.360
roughly in the same ballpark,
different assemblers might have

01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:15.245
different k values given that
the underlying technology is

01:04:15.245 --> 01:04:15.828
quite similar?

01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:24.630
Any guesses about
what is going on here?

01:04:32.990 --> 01:04:35.480
Well, we know that the
differences in the assemblers

01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:38.560
really are rooted in the
way that they are processing

01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:41.500
the graphs and the way that
they are simplifying them.

01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:43.970
And therefore,
one has to imagine

01:04:43.970 --> 01:04:47.590
that the differences lie in the
post-processing of the graph

01:04:47.590 --> 01:04:52.780
once it's built and that
certain assemblers like larger k

01:04:52.780 --> 01:04:53.330
values.

01:04:53.330 --> 01:04:57.590
Whereas other ones can
tolerate smaller k values.

01:04:57.590 --> 01:05:00.750
And you can see if we look
at the running statistics

01:05:00.750 --> 01:05:06.820
for these, that the
performance of SGA

01:05:06.820 --> 01:05:09.120
if you look at the
reference bases covered

01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:11.790
by contigs greater
than one kilobase

01:05:11.790 --> 01:05:14.470
is roughly comparable to
all the other assemblers.

01:05:14.470 --> 01:05:18.270
But its mismatch
performance is much better.

01:05:18.270 --> 01:05:22.550
That is the other assemblers
are producing-- well,

01:05:22.550 --> 01:05:24.920
I take it back except
for SOAPdenovo.

01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:27.830
But it does quite a
good job at correcting

01:05:27.830 --> 01:05:29.830
reads in coming up with
the correct sequence.

01:05:32.730 --> 01:05:36.030
The last lines however tell the
story about running time, which

01:05:36.030 --> 01:05:38.940
is that the overlap
consensus assembler is taking

01:05:38.940 --> 01:05:43.340
41 hours of CPU time for
C. elegans genome assembly.

01:05:43.340 --> 01:05:47.760
Whereas the other assemblers,
the De Bruijn assembler

01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:48.840
are running much faster.

01:05:52.270 --> 01:05:58.790
So the thing that I
wanted to emphasize today

01:05:58.790 --> 01:06:03.750
was that once you have
the final graph whether it

01:06:03.750 --> 01:06:07.130
be an overlap graph
or a De Bruijn graph,

01:06:07.130 --> 01:06:12.110
which represents possible
ways of putting back together

01:06:12.110 --> 01:06:14.910
again the jigsaw
puzzle, it still

01:06:14.910 --> 01:06:18.530
is an art to be able to
build an assembler that

01:06:18.530 --> 01:06:21.530
uses appropriate heuristics
to trace the graph

01:06:21.530 --> 01:06:24.850
to come up with a
genome sequence.

01:06:24.850 --> 01:06:27.560
And I think another
lesson is that repeats

01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:29.740
are very problematic.

01:06:29.740 --> 01:06:34.300
With short reads, we really
cannot resolve repeats exactly.

01:06:34.300 --> 01:06:39.020
As a consequence, when we think
about any reference genome

01:06:39.020 --> 01:06:42.840
that we're dealing
with, if we consider

01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:45.844
the size of the reads that were
used to assemble that genome,

01:06:45.844 --> 01:06:47.260
then we need to
be mindful of what

01:06:47.260 --> 01:06:49.070
that tells us about
whether or not

01:06:49.070 --> 01:06:51.540
the repeat structure that
we're observing in the genome

01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:53.970
is really an accurate
rendition of what's

01:06:53.970 --> 01:06:57.170
going on in the genome itself.

01:06:57.170 --> 01:06:59.840
And finally, I think
that we've talked today

01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:03.470
about the problem of
assembling genomes

01:07:03.470 --> 01:07:07.070
from a set of reads
that represent

01:07:07.070 --> 01:07:13.150
a uniform, single individual
albeit with possibilities

01:07:13.150 --> 01:07:15.250
of differences of
alleles between mom

01:07:15.250 --> 01:07:18.810
and dad in a diploid organism.

01:07:18.810 --> 01:07:21.200
However, environmental
sequencing

01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:25.410
where one takes up sea
water or other samples

01:07:25.410 --> 01:07:27.330
and sequences all
the organisms in it

01:07:27.330 --> 01:07:31.650
and then attempts to assemble
those organisms de novo

01:07:31.650 --> 01:07:33.260
admits the
possibility that there

01:07:33.260 --> 01:07:37.290
are many different genomes
that you're considering.

01:07:37.290 --> 01:07:39.340
And that, of course,
creates a whole new set

01:07:39.340 --> 01:07:40.920
of research problems,
which I think

01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:45.130
are unsolved in part
because of the read links

01:07:45.130 --> 01:07:47.800
that we're currently
dealing with.

01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:50.460
Are there any final
questions about assembly?

01:07:54.360 --> 01:07:54.940
OK, great.

01:07:54.940 --> 01:07:57.310
Well, we will see
you then on Thursday

01:07:57.310 --> 01:08:01.040
where we will talk about
ChIP-seq and IDR analysis.

01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:02.550
Until then, have
a great Wednesday.

01:08:02.550 --> 01:08:04.470
Thank you very much.
