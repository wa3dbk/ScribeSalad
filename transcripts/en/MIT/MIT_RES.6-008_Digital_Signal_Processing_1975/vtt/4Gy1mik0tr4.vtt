00:00:47.901 --> 00:00:49.400
ALAN OPPENHEIM: In
the last lecture,

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.220
we began the discussion
of the computation

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.470
of the discrete
Fourier transform.

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:59.270
And in particular, we developed
a flow graph for one algorithm.

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.010
The algorithm that we
talked about last time,

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.330
which is referred to as
the decimation in time

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.570
form of the fast Fourier
transform algorithm,

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:14.420
was derived by decomposing
the original sequence

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.100
into subsequences.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.470
First, two subsequences
consisting of the even numbered

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.950
points and the odd
numbered points,

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.080
implementing an N-over-2-point
DFT on the even numbered points

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.190
and an N-over-2-point DFT
on the odd numbered points,

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.510
and then combining those results
in an appropriate way to obtain

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.350
the discrete Fourier transform
of the overall sequence.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.690
And we saw, first
of all, that there

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.290
was a computational efficiency
that resulted from doing this.

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.670
And furthermore, we
recognized that we

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.640
could continue
this decomposition

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.790
and thereby achieve an
even greater efficiency.

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.370
In particular, with N
expressed as a power of 2,

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.360
we could continue decomposing
the N-over-2-point DFTs

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.220
into N-over-4-point DFTs,
the N-over-4-point DFTs

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.650
into N-over-8-point
DFTs, et cetera.

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.020
The flow graph
that resulted when

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:23.180
we did this was the flow
graph indicated here,

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.870
which is the one that
we derived last time.

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.270
It consists essentially of a
set of butterfly computations--

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.450
what we refer to
as butterflies--

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.910
a multiplication on
the bottom branch

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.670
of the butterfly at the
input to the butterfly,

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.610
and then an addition
and subtraction.

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.570
And that basically is
the type of computation

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.260
that follows throughout
the flow graph.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.500
Now, this is a flow
graph representing

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.800
the computation of the
discrete Fourier transform.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.610
And what is important
about the flow graph

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.110
are the nodes and the
connections between the nodes

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.960
and the transmittances
on the branches

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.080
that connect the nodes together.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:18.140
However, the flow graph in
the form that is depicted here

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.660
suggests a strategy
for organizing

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.500
the computation of the DFT.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.780
In particular, what we recognize
is that the flow graph in this

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:35.720
form tends, in a natural
way, to suggest organizing

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.910
the computation corresponding
to a computation of an input

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.060
array-- a computation
on an input array--

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:50.150
computing a second array at
this stage, from these points,

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.840
computing this array,
and from these points,

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.940
finally computing the
DFT output points.

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:06.420
If we do that and we in
fact think of these points

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.530
as corresponding to
sequential memory registers,

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.840
then we know, first of
all, that the input points

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.519
would be stored sequentially,
not in their normal order,

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:23.880
but in fact, in
some altered order.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.380
And as you'll see
in a few minutes,

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.170
what this order corresponds
to and will be referred

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:33.290
to as is bit reversed order.

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:34.860
However, an additional
point that I'd

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.930
like to make first
about this flow graph,

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.020
and that is that
it corresponds--

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.870
when thought of as a
procedure for organizing

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.340
the computation--

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.910
corresponds to an
in-place computation

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.410
of the discrete
Fourier transform.

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.890
Now, what I mean by
that is the following.

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:57.750
Let's suppose that we
think of this set of points

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:02.370
as corresponding to
sequential registers in memory

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.820
and we'd like to compute
from this set of points

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:11.010
this second array that is
the set of points here.

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:14.400
What we notice is that
because of the butterfly

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.360
structure of this
computation, it

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.740
is these two points that are
used to compute these two

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.960
points in the next array.

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.270
These points are used
to compute these two

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.210
points in the next
array, et cetera,

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:37.200
so that in fact, we can organize
the computation by implementing

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.580
the computation required
on these two input points,

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:46.170
storing the results in a
corresponding set of memory

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:50.490
locations, which in fact
could be the original memory

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.850
locations from which we
took these data points.

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:56.360
The reason for that
is that once we've

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:00.850
used these two data points,
we don't need them any longer.

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:03.560
And so the result
of this butterfly

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:08.010
we could in fact store back in
the original memory locations.

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:13.020
And a few minutes of reflection
on this flow graph in general

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:17.220
would indicate that this is
true throughout the computation.

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.920
It's clearly true in
going from the first stage

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:21.990
to the second stage.

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:25.740
In proceeding from this
stage to the next stage,

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:30.900
we see again, for example in
computing these two points,

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:34.380
the only input points
that we use are these two.

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:36.630
So again we could
think of storing

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:40.470
the result of this computation
for this butterfly,

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:45.190
for example, back in the
original memory locations.

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:51.840
So if we think of nodes on
the same horizontal line

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:56.850
as corresponding to
identical memory registers,

00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:01.080
then we see that with
the computation organized

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:04.080
in the way that this
flow graph suggests,

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:08.190
that in fact the computation
can be done in place.

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:12.900
And we'll see that with
some other alternative forms

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:16.200
of the FFT algorithm, some
alternative forms of this flow

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:20.130
graph, there perhaps
are other advantages,

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:22.380
but for some of the
other flow graphs,

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:26.190
the computation can no
longer be done in-place.

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:29.400
So first of all, this
flow graph represents

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:33.300
an in-place algorithm.

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:38.560
Second of all, the input points
are in some altered order,

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:42.000
although the DFT
output points come out

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.040
in what is normal order.

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:46.980
That is, sequential order if
we think of these as sequential

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:48.180
registers.

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:52.560
Well, let's examine in a little
more detail what the order is

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:56.760
that is being generated here.

00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:05.990
If we simply look at
the memory registers

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:11.200
and the corresponding data index
from the previous flow graph,

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:15.350
in storage registers 0
we're storing x of 0,

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:18.310
in storage register 1
we're storing x of 4,

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:21.730
storage register 2, x
of 2, and et cetera.

00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:24.640
These are the storage
register locations.

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:27.960
These are the data indices.

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:33.120
If we write the storage
register locations in binary

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:37.169
and we write the data index
in binary, what we see,

00:08:37.169 --> 00:08:41.100
interestingly enough,
is that the data index

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:47.730
is the bit reversed counterpart
of the storage register index.

00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:52.950
So here, for example, we
have 001, storage register 1.

00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:57.720
Here we have 100,
which is data index 4.

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.690
And this continues
on throughout.

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:06.240
110 is storage register
6, bit reversed is 011,

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:09.100
which is data index 3.

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:15.690
Now, it's not accidental that
this developed in such a way

00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:19.920
that the data is in fact
stored in a bit reversed order.

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:24.030
The reason for that basically
is because of the way

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:28.710
in which we originally
sorted the sequence

00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:31.170
into the even numbered
points and the odd numbered

00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:34.350
points, then the even numbered
of the even numbered points,

00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:38.340
and the odd numbered of the
even numbered points, et cetera.

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:47.030
In particular, suppose that we
considered a tree to carry out

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:50.510
the sorting that we
implemented in breaking

00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:54.520
the original sequence
up into subsequences.

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:58.430
Well, we started with
the original sequence

00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:03.790
and we divided that into two
subsequences, one corresponding

00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:06.490
to the even numbered points,
the second corresponding

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:08.960
to the odd numbered points.

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:13.360
If you look at the binary
representation of the data

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:17.440
index, you can identify
the even numbered points

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:22.940
by the points for which the
least significant binary bit is

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:25.900
a 0 and the odd numbered
points for which the least

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:29.450
significant binary bit is a 1.

00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:33.760
So we divided the original
sequence into two subsequences.

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:37.990
The top half all had 0 as
the least significant bit.

00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:42.270
The bottom half all had 1 as
the least significant bit.

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:45.070
Well, then for the
even numbered points

00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:48.190
we wanted to divide those into
the even numbered of the even

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:50.980
numbered and the odd numbered
of the even numbered.

00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:52.220
How would we do that?

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:54.730
Well, we would do
that by examining

00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:57.730
the next least significant bit.

00:10:57.730 --> 00:11:02.410
If that's a 0, then we
would identify the data

00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:05.380
as being an even numbered
of the even numbered points.

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:07.750
If it's a 1, it's
an odd numbered

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:09.700
of the even numbered points.

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:14.380
So this data was sorted
as we've indicated here.

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:17.110
And then, of course,
we continue on looking

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:20.950
at the bits from the
right to the left.

00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:24.370
So sorting, then we could
sort in the order that

00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:29.090
resulted by constructing a
tree, as I've indicated here,

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:34.940
and examining the bits
from the right to the left.

00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:39.000
Suppose that we wanted
instead to sort the data,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.500
not as I've indicated
here, but in normal order.

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:45.980
In other words, we
have a bucket of data.

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:51.110
We want to sort the data so
that the data index comes out

00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:52.490
in normal order.

00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:56.180
How would we do that with a
similar type of tree structure?

00:11:56.180 --> 00:12:01.370
Well, to decide whether
the data index is

00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:03.890
in the top half
or the bottom half

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:06.380
we would look at the
most significant bit.

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:08.880
If the most
significant bit is a 0,

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:12.410
then the data is in the top
half of the entire set of data.

00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:14.690
And if the most
significant bit is a 1,

00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:17.390
the data is in the bottom half.

00:12:17.390 --> 00:12:20.810
Next, we would proceed to the
second most significant bit.

00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:24.020
If the second most
significant bit is a 0,

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:27.530
then we fall either into
the top half of the top half

00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:29.810
or the top half of
the bottom half.

00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:33.470
And we continue on like that
going through a tree exactly

00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:36.890
identical to this,
but examining the bits

00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:41.420
for sorting in normal order from
the most significant bit down

00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:43.470
to the least significant bit.

00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:48.500
So it is basically that in
sorting the data as we sorted

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:54.080
it to develop the flow
graph that we developed,

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:57.800
we examined the bits in
exactly the reverse order

00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:59.780
that we would examine
the bits if we wanted

00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:01.640
to sort the data normally.

00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:06.560
And consequently what results
is data that's sorted in bit

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:07.500
reversed order.

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:17.440
Incidentally, speaking of
things being bit reversed,

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:23.690
the view graph as I first
got it back from drafting I

00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:26.720
thought you might
enjoy looking at.

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:29.342
And if you find
your mind wandering

00:13:29.342 --> 00:13:30.800
during the rest of
the lecture, you

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:33.440
might try to figure out exactly
what happened with this view

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:35.030
graph.

00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:38.330
The first inclination is that
I simply have it turned around,

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:42.020
so we can try that.

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:43.580
Well, that doesn't quite do it.

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:45.950
So maybe we should turn it over.

00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:47.760
And that doesn't quite do it.

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:51.860
And in fact, I haven't yet
been able to figure out

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:56.090
a way of sorting this particular
view graph in any normal order

00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:59.000
and I'd be curious as to
whether you can figure out

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.710
a way to straighten it out.

00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:05.660
Well, in any case,
what we have then is

00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:09.290
a sorting of the original data--

00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:12.640
returning now to the flow
graph that we saw previously--

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:15.240
a sorting of the
original data in bit

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:22.250
reversed order and the output
resulting in normal order.

00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:24.650
Well, of course this
isn't the only way

00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:29.250
to organize the computation of
the discrete Fourier transform.

00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:34.400
And in fact, an important
aspect of the flow graph

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:38.090
is as I stressed previously
that what counts about the flow

00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:42.350
graph are the nodes and the
way they're connected and not

00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:45.980
the way the flow graph
is laid out in a sheet.

00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:48.290
When it's laid
out in a sheet, we

00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:51.920
were able to apply some
additional interpretation

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:57.260
having to do with a way of
organizing the computation

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.450
from stage to stage.

00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:04.100
But it's important to recognize
that if you take this flow

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:09.650
graph, roll it up in a ball,
as long as the right points are

00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:11.900
connected to the
right points, then

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:14.690
it still represents
a computation

00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:16.890
of the discrete
Fourier transform.

00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:21.320
So in particular, we are free
to rearrange this flow graph

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:23.990
in any way that we
would like to as long

00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:28.740
as we don't change the
connections between the notes.

00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:33.120
Well, one possible thought is
to rearrange the flow graph

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:37.860
so that we avoid this problem
of bit reversal on the input.

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:42.540
We can think of
rearranging these lines

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:49.360
so that the input is changed
to an input in normal order.

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:51.660
And one way of
doing that, in fact,

00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:55.920
is to simply take all
of the horizontal lines

00:15:55.920 --> 00:16:02.180
and rearrange them so that
the data is sorted correctly.

00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:04.290
So we would leave
this line where

00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:07.710
it is, we would take this
line and move it up to here,

00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:11.610
this line would then stay where
it is, this line would move up,

00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:14.430
and they would continue
to be rearranged.

00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:18.610
The input would be
then in normal order,

00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:21.840
the output, of course,
would be disturbed,

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:24.840
and we could anticipate
exactly how it's

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:26.520
going to be disturbed, in fact.

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:32.320
The output then will come
out in bit reversed order.

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:40.760
That flow graph is then
as I've indicated here.

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:44.740
And this then corresponds
to a rearrangement

00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:46.960
of the previous
flow graph, where

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:51.040
we have rearranged the
computation so that the input

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:54.300
is now in normal order.

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:59.090
The way in which we rearranged
it, the output then comes out

00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:01.400
in bit reversed order.

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:04.910
Incidentally, on most of
the following view graphs,

00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:10.430
I have indicated a reference to
the figure in the text, which

00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:14.339
this view graph corresponds
to, because in fact, many

00:17:14.339 --> 00:17:16.339
of these flow graphs will
be going through quite

00:17:16.339 --> 00:17:18.170
a number of flow graphs.

00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:21.680
Many of them look
very similar, so I

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:24.020
thought perhaps a reference
to the figure in the text

00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:28.230
will help you keep
them organized.

00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:34.280
So now we have a modification
of the decimation

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:37.990
in time form of
the FFT algorithm,

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:41.970
which is such that
if we now think

00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:45.990
of this as the procedure for
organizing the computation,

00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:49.360
the input is now
in normal order,

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:52.560
the output is in
bit reversed order.

00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:56.760
Have we destroyed the fact
that the original computation

00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:58.830
was an in-place computation?

00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:01.590
Well, in fact, we
haven't, because if we

00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:06.150
look at this now the way
that it's organized, again,

00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:10.590
thinking of this as
sequential memory registers,

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:16.200
then, again, if we, for
example, select this butterfly,

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:19.680
the computation of
these two points

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:23.970
requires only these
two input points.

00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:26.220
So once we have used
these two points,

00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:30.390
we can store them back in the
original memory locations.

00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:34.020
What makes the flow
graph correspond

00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:37.230
to an in-place
computation is the fact

00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:40.170
that the output nodes
of the butterfly

00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:45.720
are horizontally adjacent to the
input nodes of the butterfly.

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:48.780
If that property of the
flow graph is destroyed,

00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:53.040
then the flow graph will
no longer correspond

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:55.920
to an in-place
computation if we think

00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:59.400
of all nodes on the
same horizontal line

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:04.320
as corresponding to
identical memory registers,

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:08.100
or equivalently, that
vertical nodes correspond

00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:11.700
to sequential memory registers.

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:13.980
Well, there are a
variety of other ways

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:16.860
in which we can rearrange
this flow graph.

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:19.740
We can, of course,
modify the flow graph

00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:27.010
so that we have not only
normal order at the input,

00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:31.000
but so that we also have
normal order at the output.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.600
And we can do that
simply by demanding it.

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:36.750
In other words, by
rearranging these nodes,

00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:39.690
keeping these nodes in normal
order, rearranging these

00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:44.610
nodes so that they also
correspond to normal order.

00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:49.080
And the flow graph that
results in that case

00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:52.250
is the one that
I've indicated here.

00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:57.720
So this is now the
decimation in time form

00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:01.020
of the algorithm
with the input sorted

00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:06.840
in normal order and the output
also sorted in normal order.

00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:11.300
The computation still is
represented by butterflies,

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:13.340
but the butterflies
are distorted.

00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:16.460
In other words, each
of the butterflies

00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:21.950
no longer corresponds
to the computation

00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:26.980
of horizontally adjacent
nodes in the flow graph.

00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:31.960
So in fact, this
computation is no longer

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:34.620
an in-place computation.

00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:37.290
Well, is it an in-place
computation from this array

00:20:37.290 --> 00:20:38.340
to this one?

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:42.330
As it happens, it is in the
computation of the first array,

00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:47.350
the reason being that in each
of the butterflies, again,

00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:49.110
the output nodes
are horizontally

00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:51.060
adjacent to the input nodes.

00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:55.230
But that property is
lost after this array.

00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:58.440
And proceeding from this
array to this array,

00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:02.700
we see that to compute
these two points--

00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:05.580
let's take this
one and this one--

00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:10.530
we need this point
and this point.

00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:13.617
So we couldn't store then
this answer back in here

00:21:13.617 --> 00:21:15.200
because we're going
to need this point

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:18.030
to compute some other
output points, et cetera.

00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:22.790
So this flow graph in this
form has the disadvantage

00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:26.870
that the in-place computational
aspects of the flow graph

00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:29.990
are lost although the
input is in normal order

00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:33.530
and the output is
in normal order.

00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:35.540
It has another
disadvantage incidentally,

00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:39.860
and that is that the indexing is
somewhat difficult in contrast

00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:42.650
to the two flow graphs
that we've talked about

00:21:42.650 --> 00:21:46.640
so far where the indexing
strategy is relatively

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:50.960
straightforward
from stage to stage.

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:53.510
Now, there's another
rearrangement

00:21:53.510 --> 00:22:04.290
of this flow graph which
has some advantages and also

00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:06.240
some disadvantages.

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:09.960
First, let me return to
the original flow graph

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:13.290
that we began with, which
consisted of the input sorted

00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:21.010
in bit reversed order and the
output sorted in normal order.

00:22:21.010 --> 00:22:24.240
The indexing in
this flow graph is

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:28.290
relatively straightforward
in that you should notice

00:22:28.290 --> 00:22:31.170
that as you proceed
from stage to stage,

00:22:31.170 --> 00:22:35.010
the width of the butterflies
continues to double.

00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:36.690
So here the width
of the butterfly

00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:40.890
is 1, here the width
of the butterfly is 2--

00:22:40.890 --> 00:22:42.540
or the height of the butterfly--

00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:46.040
here the height of
the butterfly is 4.

00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:48.690
If we were computing a
larger order transform,

00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:51.870
then that procedure
would continue.

00:22:51.870 --> 00:23:00.070
But as you can imagine, if
we were implementing this

00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:04.630
on a computer or with
special purpose hardware,

00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:07.480
because of the fact that
the data separation as we

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:11.350
compute each butterfly
increases or changes as we

00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:14.560
go from stage to
stage, what is required

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:17.060
is random access memory.

00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:23.320
We require random access
memory because in each array

00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:27.250
we are not accessing data
from sequential registers.

00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:29.740
We are going from this
array to this one.

00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:32.680
After that, in
computing a butterfly,

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:37.360
we no longer are accessing
sequential registers.

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:41.300
There is, however, a
modification of this algorithm

00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:47.350
which is useful in the sense
that it permits the computation

00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:50.320
without random access
memory and in particular

00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:53.980
is organized so that it can
utilize sequential memory,

00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:58.810
although it does not correspond
to an in-place computation.

00:23:58.810 --> 00:24:04.760
And that form of the algorithm,
I have indicated here,

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:08.980
is a form of the
algorithm that originally

00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:11.920
was proposed by singleton.

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:17.380
This then is a form of the
decimation in time algorithm.

00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:19.810
It's a rearrangement
of the flowchart

00:24:19.810 --> 00:24:25.630
so that sequential memory can be
used rather than random access

00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:27.260
memory.

00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:30.190
Let me point out first
of all that the input is

00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:34.040
in bit reversed order, the
output is in normal order,

00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:37.300
and now let me explain
in a little more detail

00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:42.520
why this flow graph allows
the use of sequential memory

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:44.870
rather than random
access memory.

00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:49.300
First of all, let me indicate
that the organization

00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:54.010
of this flow graph is
identical from stage to stage.

00:24:54.010 --> 00:24:58.600
In other words, if you think
of how this piece of the flow

00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:01.790
graph looks in computing
the first stage,

00:25:01.790 --> 00:25:04.180
it is exactly the same
with regard to data

00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:07.720
access as computing
this stage is

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:10.510
in relation to
the one before it,

00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:12.520
and this continues on through.

00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:16.030
So as opposed to the other
forms of the algorithm,

00:25:16.030 --> 00:25:18.370
the indexing is
identical from stage

00:25:18.370 --> 00:25:21.940
to stage in this form
of the algorithm.

00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:25.600
Now, to utilize sequential
memory-- sequential memory

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:29.200
might be disk memory or drum
memory or shift register

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:30.890
memory, for example.

00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:35.530
Generally, bulk memory is
sequential memory rather than

00:25:35.530 --> 00:25:37.270
random access.

00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:42.890
Let's think of the original
data first shuffled

00:25:42.890 --> 00:25:46.580
in bit reversed
order and then stored

00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:48.710
in two separate memories.

00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:51.380
Let's call them M
sub A and M sub B.

00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:53.150
The first half of
the data is stored

00:25:53.150 --> 00:25:58.370
in memory A. The second half of
the data is stored in memory B.

00:25:58.370 --> 00:26:02.030
And then let's permit two
additional sequential memory

00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:07.220
registers, memories
M sub C and M sub D

00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:10.430
for storing the output
of the computation.

00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:15.390
Then the computation would
proceed essentially as follows.

00:26:15.390 --> 00:26:19.640
We would access the first two
data points from memory A,

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:25.010
use those to compute the
first point in this array,

00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:30.770
store that in memory C, and use
that to compute the first point

00:26:30.770 --> 00:26:33.590
in the second half of
this array and store

00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:38.570
that in memory D. Next, we
would access the next two input

00:26:38.570 --> 00:26:43.220
points from memory
A, add those--

00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:45.860
we would do the required
computation-- store

00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:51.560
the result in the next
location in memory A,

00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:55.070
also store the second
half of the butterfly

00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:59.540
output in the second
register in memory D.

00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:04.790
So as we proceed along, we
access the first two points

00:27:04.790 --> 00:27:07.730
from memory A then the next
two points from memory A,

00:27:07.730 --> 00:27:11.610
storing in memory
C and memory D.

00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:14.540
When we have gone through
the first half of the data,

00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:18.710
we now access the data from
the second input memory,

00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:24.950
memory B, the first two points,
do the required computation,

00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:29.800
and store in the next
sequential registers in memory C

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:32.060
and memory D, et cetera.

00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:34.700
So the strategy
in this case, then

00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:43.240
is that the input is stored half
in memory A, half in memory B.

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:46.030
The data is first
accessed from memory A

00:27:46.030 --> 00:27:51.490
and we alternately put
results in memories C and D.

00:27:51.490 --> 00:27:56.490
When we finish with memory A,
we then proceed to memory B,

00:27:56.490 --> 00:27:59.140
access data sequentially,
and continue

00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:04.030
to store the results
alternating in memory C and D.

00:28:04.030 --> 00:28:07.660
Now that gives us the
result at this stage.

00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:11.410
To compute the next stage,
we now start with the memory

00:28:11.410 --> 00:28:17.140
C and D as the inputs and store
the results of the computation

00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:21.140
back into memories A
and B. So in a sense,

00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:23.680
you can think of
the computation then

00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:28.255
as involving four memory, four
separate sequential memories,

00:28:28.255 --> 00:28:31.690
A, B, C, and D. We
start with A and B,

00:28:31.690 --> 00:28:38.110
flush the data into memory C and
D, then flush the results back.

00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:40.870
And in fact, you can
think of the computation

00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:43.870
much the same way
as a slinky toy

00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:48.160
where you bounce the data back
and forth between these two

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:49.580
sets of sequential memories.

00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:55.860
That then is a form of
the computation which

00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:57.830
is not an in-place computation.

00:28:57.830 --> 00:29:00.840
And furthermore, the
input is bit reversed,

00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:03.400
although the output
is in normal order,

00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:06.600
and it has the
advantage, though,

00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:09.780
that the indexing is
identical from stage to stage

00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:14.460
and consequently can utilize
sequential memory rather

00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:17.810
than requiring
random access memory.

00:29:17.810 --> 00:29:22.580
Well, that then completes the
discussion of the decimation

00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:24.890
in time form of the algorithm.

00:29:24.890 --> 00:29:28.490
There are, of course, a number
of other variations on this

00:29:28.490 --> 00:29:32.520
and some of them are
discussed in the text.

00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:37.140
What I'd like to proceed to now
is a slightly different form

00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:41.550
of FFT algorithms
which are really

00:29:41.550 --> 00:29:45.030
derived on a somewhat different
basis than the decimation

00:29:45.030 --> 00:29:47.040
in time form of the algorithms.

00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:49.830
But we'll see as
we finally continue

00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:53.820
the discussion that there
is a very close relationship

00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:56.550
between the decimation
in time algorithms

00:29:56.550 --> 00:30:00.150
as we've just talked about and
the class of algorithms which

00:30:00.150 --> 00:30:02.070
I would now like
to introduce, which

00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:08.150
are the decimation in frequency
forms of the FFT algorithm.

00:30:08.150 --> 00:30:12.680
Well, in particular,
the notion in deriving

00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:18.740
the decimation and frequency
forms of the FFT algorithm

00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:22.490
is, essentially, rather
than breaking the input up

00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:25.660
into the even numbered and
the odd numbered points,

00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:29.960
organize the computation so that
we compute separately the even

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:33.620
numbered and odd
numbered output points.

00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:38.840
In particular, let's look
again at the general form

00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:41.630
for the discrete
Fourier transform x of k

00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:47.270
given by this sum and let's
consider decomposing this

00:30:47.270 --> 00:30:51.740
into a sum over the first
half of the input points

00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:56.480
and a sum over the second
half of the input points.

00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:59.120
Well, the sum over the
second half of the input

00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:04.460
points we can rearrange somewhat
differently by essentially

00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:07.040
implementing a
substitution of variables

00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:12.440
so that the index on the sum
is changed to an index from 0

00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:15.270
to N over 2 minus 1.

00:31:15.270 --> 00:31:19.340
And if we do that, the
sum that results then,

00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:22.430
the expression that
results, is W sub N

00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:27.620
to the N over 2 k times the sum
of x of n plus capital N over 2

00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:30.260
times W sub N to the nk.

00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:33.770
And you can easily check
that this is correct.

00:31:33.770 --> 00:31:37.610
For example, for little n
equal to capital N over 2

00:31:37.610 --> 00:31:42.080
here, we have x of
capital N over 2 W sub N

00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:44.390
to the capital N over 2 k.

00:31:44.390 --> 00:31:48.590
Here, for little n equals 0,
we get W sub N to the capital

00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:54.210
N over 2 k times x
of capital N over 2,

00:31:54.210 --> 00:31:56.130
and this term becomes 1.

00:31:56.130 --> 00:32:00.300
Just simply a
substitution of variables.

00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:07.290
Well, we recognize this term,
W sub n to the N over 2 k,

00:32:07.290 --> 00:32:11.280
is equal to minus 1.

00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:13.950
And consequently,
then we can rewrite

00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:17.730
this as I've
indicated here, x of k

00:32:17.730 --> 00:32:24.960
is equal to a sum from n equals
0 to N over 2 minus 1 of x of n

00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:27.150
plus minus 1 to the k--

00:32:27.150 --> 00:32:31.230
k being the index on the DFT--

00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:36.580
times x of n plus capital
N over 2 W sub N to the nk.

00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:41.320
Well, it's tempting to look at
this and say kind of in analogy

00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:42.850
with the decimation in time--

00:32:42.850 --> 00:32:45.850
the steps we took in the
decimation time algorithm,

00:32:45.850 --> 00:32:49.480
that this is an
N-over-2-point DFT.

00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:52.510
It is a sum from 0
to N over 2 minus 1,

00:32:52.510 --> 00:32:56.905
it's a modified input sequence,
but it's not, in fact,

00:32:56.905 --> 00:32:58.930
an N-over-2-point DFT.

00:32:58.930 --> 00:33:05.200
And the reason that it isn't is
that this is W sub N to the nk

00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:08.320
whereas if it was an
N-over-2-point DFT,

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:14.170
this would be W sub
capital N over 2 to the nk.

00:33:14.170 --> 00:33:21.040
However, let's look at these DFT
points for two separate cases,

00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:25.830
one being that for which
the index, the output index,

00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:30.970
is even and the second for
which the output index is odd.

00:33:30.970 --> 00:33:33.580
The output index
is even, then we

00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:38.350
can think of that as indexing
through the DFT points

00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:44.290
with an argument x of 2r,
where r ranges from 0 to N

00:33:44.290 --> 00:33:46.240
over 2 minus 1.

00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:52.540
And we then have this sum since
k is even, minus 1 to the k

00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:56.800
is positive and we have
then this sum that I've

00:33:56.800 --> 00:34:01.630
indicated here,
whereas for k odd,

00:34:01.630 --> 00:34:08.139
we choose an index 2r plus 1,
where again r ranges from 0

00:34:08.139 --> 00:34:10.820
to N over 2 minus 1.

00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:15.190
And because k is odd,
what results in the sum

00:34:15.190 --> 00:34:19.580
is a subtraction rather
than an addition.

00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:22.780
And then we have
substituting in also.

00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:26.560
We have W sub capital N to the
little n times W sub capital

00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:29.610
N to the 2rn.

00:34:29.610 --> 00:34:33.750
Now, finally, we can take
advantage of the fact

00:34:33.750 --> 00:34:38.370
that W sub N to the 2rn
can be written in terms

00:34:38.370 --> 00:34:41.159
of W sub capital N over 2.

00:34:41.159 --> 00:34:45.900
In particular, W sub
capital N to the 2rn

00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:51.150
is equal to W sub capital
N over 2 to the rn.

00:34:51.150 --> 00:34:56.130
And that follows as it did
and we utilize that fact also

00:34:56.130 --> 00:34:59.400
in deriving the decimation in
time form of the algorithm.

00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:01.560
It follows simply
by substituting

00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:07.020
in to the expression
for W sub capital N.

00:35:07.020 --> 00:35:13.520
Finally utilizing
this, we recognize

00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:17.930
that for the
computation of the DFT

00:35:17.930 --> 00:35:24.350
for that the output index
even, the computation

00:35:24.350 --> 00:35:29.660
can be reduced to a sum of a
sequence g of n, where g of n

00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:34.430
is the sum of the first half and
the last half of the input data

00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:35.930
points.

00:35:35.930 --> 00:35:39.580
That multiplied by W sub
capital N over 2 to the rn.

00:35:42.130 --> 00:35:47.920
Well, this is now an
N-over-2-point discrete Fourier

00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:49.180
transform.

00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:55.570
It involves N-over-2-points and
the powers of W involved are

00:35:55.570 --> 00:35:58.750
the appropriate
powers of W for--

00:35:58.750 --> 00:36:02.355
or rather the W is involved
is the appropriate W

00:36:02.355 --> 00:36:05.590
for an N-over-2-point DFT.

00:36:05.590 --> 00:36:09.540
That's indicated by
this subscript N over 2.

00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:13.380
So this is to compute
the even numbered points.

00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:15.720
To compute the odd
numbered points,

00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:18.540
we have a similar expression.

00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:25.200
We have the sum of h of n
times W sub capital N to the n,

00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:30.460
and that times W sub N over
2 to the rn, where h of n

00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:35.160
is the difference between the
first half of the data points

00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:38.360
and the last half
of the data points.

00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:41.430
So basically, following
this strategy,

00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:46.210
what this says is that we can
compute the discrete Fourier

00:36:46.210 --> 00:36:50.420
transform by forming
a subsequence,

00:36:50.420 --> 00:36:54.620
which is the sum of the first
and last half of the points,

00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:58.970
and computing the
N-over-2-point DFT of that,

00:36:58.970 --> 00:37:02.720
and then forming a sequence,
which is the difference

00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:06.290
of the first and the last
half of the input points,

00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:10.640
multiplying that by W sub
capital N to the little n,

00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:16.270
and computing the
N-over-2-point DFT of that.

00:37:16.270 --> 00:37:20.920
And if you count up the
number of operations involved,

00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:23.010
multiplications
and additions, you

00:37:23.010 --> 00:37:26.440
will find that there is
exactly the same computational

00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:29.470
efficiency implied
in this decomposition

00:37:29.470 --> 00:37:31.910
as there was as we went
through the decimation

00:37:31.910 --> 00:37:35.800
in time form of the algorithm.

00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:42.040
So this then is the basis for
the decimation in time form

00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:50.560
of the computation and it
basically states that we would

00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:56.890
compute the discrete Fourier
transform by first forming

00:37:56.890 --> 00:38:02.440
a subsequence, which
we denoted as g,

00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:06.400
which we obtain by adding the
first half of the input points

00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:09.100
to the last half of
the input points,

00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:14.340
and implementing an
N-over-2-point DFT of that

00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:20.080
to obtain the even
numbered output points.

00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:24.480
And then we would subtract the
first half of the input points

00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:27.360
from the last half
of the input points,

00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:34.140
multiply that subsequence,
h, by successive powers of W,

00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:38.580
compute an N-over-2-point
DFT of that,

00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:44.530
and the result would then be
the odd numbered output points.

00:38:44.530 --> 00:38:46.800
Well, just as we did
with the decimation

00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:51.790
in time form of the algorithm,
we can continue this procedure.

00:38:51.790 --> 00:38:56.040
In other words, we can decompose
the N-over-2-point DFTs

00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:59.940
into N-over-4-point DFTs
by adding the first half

00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:03.030
of the input points here to
the last half, et cetera.

00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:06.030
As we proceed
through, we would then

00:39:06.030 --> 00:39:09.570
develop a flow graph in
which we would compute first

00:39:09.570 --> 00:39:12.030
the even numbered of the
even numbered output points

00:39:12.030 --> 00:39:16.230
and then the odd numbered of
the even numbered output points,

00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:17.700
et cetera.

00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:20.670
So you can imagine that as
we proceed through this,

00:39:20.670 --> 00:39:22.950
we'll get a flow graph.

00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:25.140
Similar in many respects
to the flow graph

00:39:25.140 --> 00:39:26.730
that we developed
for the decimation

00:39:26.730 --> 00:39:30.570
in time form of the algorithm,
and furthermore, the flow graph

00:39:30.570 --> 00:39:33.600
as it naturally
develops this way will

00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:41.880
result in data, the DFT output,
sorted in a bit reversed order.

00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:47.370
So continuing on then, here
is the decomposition with

00:39:47.370 --> 00:39:53.520
the N-over-2-point DFTs broken
into N-over-4-point DFTs,

00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:57.930
and we are now computing the
even numbered of the even

00:39:57.930 --> 00:40:00.800
numbered output points first.

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:05.970
The N-over-4-point DFTs, if we
consider the specific case of N

00:40:05.970 --> 00:40:11.263
equals 8, the N-over-4-point
DFTs are just simply 2-point

00:40:11.263 --> 00:40:17.850
DFTs, which involve, as they did
in the decimation in time form

00:40:17.850 --> 00:40:22.350
of the algorithm, just simply
a computation involving

00:40:22.350 --> 00:40:25.050
an addition and a subtraction.

00:40:25.050 --> 00:40:28.650
In other words, just
a simple butterfly.

00:40:28.650 --> 00:40:32.250
So the resulting
flow graph based

00:40:32.250 --> 00:40:36.360
on pursuing this strategy
through the entire computation

00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:40.020
is as I've indicated
here, which is

00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:43.860
one form of the
decimation in frequency

00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:46.400
form of the algorithm.

00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:50.550
Notice that the input
is in normal order,

00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:55.560
the output is in bit reversed
order, the flow graph

00:40:55.560 --> 00:40:59.580
as it developed here,
again, if we think

00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:05.010
of it as a
computational strategy,

00:41:05.010 --> 00:41:08.190
a strategy for organizing
the computation,

00:41:08.190 --> 00:41:13.500
again, corresponds to
an in-place computation.

00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:21.230
It's an in-place computation
because output nodes

00:41:21.230 --> 00:41:25.130
for a butterfly are horizontally
adjacent to the input

00:41:25.130 --> 00:41:27.950
nodes of the butterfly.

00:41:27.950 --> 00:41:30.500
In many respects,
in fact, it looks

00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:35.600
somewhat like the decimation
in time form of the algorithm

00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:39.560
when we sorted things such that
the input was in normal order

00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:43.010
and the output was in
bit reversed order.

00:41:43.010 --> 00:41:46.130
In fact, there is a
difference between this class

00:41:46.130 --> 00:41:50.480
of algorithms and the decimation
in time form of the algorithm.

00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:54.410
One difference that I would
just draw your attention to

00:41:54.410 --> 00:42:01.340
quickly is the fact that the
butterflies in the decimation

00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:03.170
in frequency form
of the algorithm,

00:42:03.170 --> 00:42:05.630
as we've just been
talking about it,

00:42:05.630 --> 00:42:09.640
involve additions
and subtractions,

00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:12.700
and the multiplication
by powers of W

00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:16.840
is implemented on the
output of the butterfly.

00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:24.260
Whereas for the decimation in
time form of the algorithm,

00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:28.890
the multiplication by a power of
W was implemented at the input

00:42:28.890 --> 00:42:33.660
to the butterfly followed by
an addition and subtraction.

00:42:33.660 --> 00:42:39.110
So in fact, the decimation
and frequency form

00:42:39.110 --> 00:42:43.310
of the algorithm as
we've just developed it

00:42:43.310 --> 00:42:45.950
is somewhat different
than the decimation

00:42:45.950 --> 00:42:48.830
in time form of the algorithm.

00:42:48.830 --> 00:42:52.820
As we'll see as we continue
in the next lecture,

00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:57.020
there are modifications of
this form of the algorithm

00:42:57.020 --> 00:42:58.820
just as there were
for the decimation

00:42:58.820 --> 00:43:00.950
in time form of the algorithm.

00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:04.040
And we'll also see
that in fact there

00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:09.770
is a very close relationship
between these two

00:43:09.770 --> 00:43:13.580
forms of the algorithm, the
relationship being suggested

00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:18.320
by properties of flow graphs
that we've discussed in some

00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:21.740
of the previous lectures.

00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:27.140
So at this point, then we
have concluded our discussion

00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:31.010
of the decimation in time
forms of the algorithm,

00:43:31.010 --> 00:43:34.310
we've introduced the
decimation in frequency form

00:43:34.310 --> 00:43:35.690
of the algorithm.

00:43:35.690 --> 00:43:38.240
In the next lecture,
what I would like to do

00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:43.040
is continue on a discussion
of the decimation in frequency

00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:48.890
forms, in particular discussing
alternative forms which

00:43:48.890 --> 00:43:50.750
are similar to the
alternative forms

00:43:50.750 --> 00:43:52.580
that we discussed for
decimation in time.

00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:54.430
Thank you.
