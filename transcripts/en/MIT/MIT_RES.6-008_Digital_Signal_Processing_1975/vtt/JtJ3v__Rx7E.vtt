ALAN OPPENHEIM: In the
last several lectures,

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.970
we've considered a
number of procedures

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:06.610
for designing digital
filters for the class

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.730
of infinite impulse
response filters.

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.880
And the two primary
design techniques

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.120
that we considered, in
fact, the two useful design

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.240
techniques that we developed,
were the techniques

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.190
which we refer to as
impulse invariance, and also

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.400
the bilinear transformation.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.180
You recall, hopefully, that
both of these techniques

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:37.560
are techniques that correspond
to mapping a continuous time

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.120
or analog filter to
a digital filter.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.660
What I'd like to
do in this lecture

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.860
is consider an
example of the design

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.180
of a digital low-pass filter
using each of these techniques,

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.900
using impulse invariance and
the bilinear transformation.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.740
And hopefully this will give
you a better feeling for how

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.080
both of these techniques work.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:09.050
The class of analog filters
that I would like to use

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.200
are the class of so-called
analog Butterworth filters,

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.970
which are a useful
class of lowpass analog

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.525
and digital filters, and also
a relatively simple class.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.360
To first of all, define
the class of analog filters

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.270
that we're considering,
they are the class

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.550
of analog Butterworth filters.

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:39.970
And this class of filters is
defined by the analog system

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:45.820
function H sub a of j omega
magnitude squared of the form

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:51.910
1 over 1 plus j omega divided
by j omega sub c to the 2N.

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.750
Now, there are two parameters
in this expression.

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.370
One is what's referred to often
as the cutoff frequency, omega

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:01.720
sub c.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.600
And the second is the
order of the filter,

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.720
namely N. Let me
remind you that we're

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.660
looking at here an expression
for the squared magnitude

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:11.970
function.

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.910
And so we have a 2N here.

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.610
But in fact, N is
what corresponds

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.490
to the order of the filter.

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:24.000
Well, if we look at
this frequency response

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.390
characteristic, we observe
that at omega equal to 0,

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:35.180
the gain or the magnitude
squared is equal to unity.

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:41.810
At omega equal to omega sub c,
the j's of course cancel out.

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.610
At omega equal to omega sub c,
this term then is equal to 1,

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.660
and we have for the magnitude
squared function, a half.

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.210
Or for the magnitude
function, which

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:56.810
is what we're looking
at here, 1 divided

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.910
by the square root of 2.

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.820
So at omega equal
to omega sub c,

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:06.410
an analog Butterworth filter has
a magnitude which is down by 1

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:08.570
over the square root of 2.

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:11.510
And the other important
characteristic

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:17.000
is that the frequency response
is a monotonic function

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.589
of capital Omega.

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:23.720
So that as capital Omega
increases from 0 to infinity,

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.180
the magnitude or the
frequency response

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.990
is a monotonic function.

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.250
Well, we observed that the
cutoff frequency, the parameter

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:39.500
omega sub c, adjusts in a
sense where we might divide

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.480
the frequency characteristic
into passband, transition band,

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.530
and stopband.

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.090
We have another parameter,
which is the parameter

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.540
N, the order of the filter.

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:55.220
And basically the effect
that the parameter N has

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:00.500
is to affect the shape of this
frequency response in the sense

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:06.590
that if capital N is larger,
the frequency response tends

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:12.650
to be flatter longer, so that
for a larger N than what I've

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.590
drawn with the black curve,
the frequency response might

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:21.150
look more like this and
then drop off sharper.

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:25.500
Whereas if capital N
is smaller, then it

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.350
will be less flat
in the passband

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:30.430
and drop off more slowly.

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:34.760
So in fact, the way
that I've drawn it here,

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:38.480
this is the behavior of the
frequency response curve

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:44.780
as the parameter
capital N increases.

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:47.630
So, the higher the
order of the filter,

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:52.040
the sharper the
drop from what we

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:56.270
could consider as a passband
region into a stopband region.

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:59.870
And obviously then, the
sharper the filter we want,

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:04.430
the higher order
filter we would design.

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:07.880
Now, to look at
the pole 0 pattern

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:13.470
or the 0 pattern really
of the Butterworth filter,

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:19.070
we can convert this expression
into an expression relating

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:22.160
the magnitude squared
function expressed

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:26.240
in terms of the Laplace
transform variable s.

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:31.250
And so this expression
corresponds to the product

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:36.500
H sub a of s times H sub a
of minus s, evaluated at s

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:41.840
equals j omega, in
which case the j omega

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:46.755
is what corresponds to s, and
so H sub a of s times H sub

00:06:46.755 --> 00:06:51.590
a of minus s is of
the form 1 over 1 plus

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:58.650
s divided by j omega sub
c raised to the 2N power.

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:05.040
Well, what we recognize is
that this expression has poles,

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.200
if we solve this equation.

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:10.470
This expression has poles
at of course the roots

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:15.690
of the denominator polynomial
or at s sub p equal to minus 1

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:19.830
to the over 2N
times j omega sub c.

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:23.040
That's simply solving the
equation with this denominator

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:26.830
polynomial equal to 0.

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:30.460
Well, we can see
more specifically

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:34.990
where these poles
lie in the s plane

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:40.870
by recognizing that these
are the 2N roots of minus 1.

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:44.020
And then we have a
j, which corresponds

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:48.700
to e to the j pi over 2.

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:52.810
So we can rewrite this
expression for the poles

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:59.450
as s sub p equal to e
to the j pi over 2N.

00:08:03.336 --> 00:08:09.450
That's one of the roots of
minus 1, plus k times 2 pi

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:11.380
where k is an integer.

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:14.790
This generates the
roots of minus 1.

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:17.310
We need to multiply by
j, and we can do that

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:20.220
by multiplying by e to
the j pi over 2, which

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:25.680
is equal to j times omega sub
c, which is the cutoff frequency

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:28.680
parameter for the
Butterworth filter.

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:32.370
So this then specifies
where the pole locations

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:34.470
are for the Butterworth filter.

00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:38.940
For example, if we
consider the case,

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:45.570
let's say with n equal to
3, k let's say equal to 0.

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:49.105
That says then that
we have a pole at e

00:08:49.105 --> 00:08:56.300
to the j pi divided by 6,
e to the j pi over 6, times

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:58.320
e to the j pi over 2.

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:01.670
In other words, we have
a pole in the s plane

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:05.570
at an angle of pi
over 6 plus pi over 2,

00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:08.870
which corresponds
to this location.

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:14.750
Then we'll have poles
distributed in angle

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:18.410
around a circle in the
s plane, distributed

00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:22.400
in an angle where the
angular spacing is pi over 3.

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:28.010
The pi over 3 arising from
a consideration of 2 pi k

00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:32.930
divided by 2N, where in
this case, N is equal to 6.

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:39.100
So these poles are distributed
equally spaced in angle

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:42.070
on a circle in the s plane.

00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:45.810
For N equal to 3, the
angular spacing is pi over 3.

00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:50.500
For k equal to 0 that first
pole corresponds to this one,

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:53.040
and then we continue around.

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:56.640
Now these are poles
distributed on a circle, which

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:59.910
tends to look like the z plane.

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:03.360
But I stress that what
we're talking about here

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:04.410
is the s plane.

00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:07.830
In particular, we're talking
about the analog frequency

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:12.730
response design as the class
of analog Butterworth filters,

00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:15.630
which we're then going to
map to digital filters.

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:18.840
So this is a circle
in the s plane.

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:21.870
It's often referred to as
the Butterworth circle.

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:28.320
And it has a radius which
is equal to omega sub c.

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:33.240
In designing an analog
Butterworth filter then,

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:38.720
the procedure is to
appropriately choose

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:41.490
the parameters omega
sub c and capital

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:45.840
N. Those are the parameters of
the analog Butterworth filter.

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:52.530
And then from the poles
distributed on the Butterworth

00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:58.240
circle, this gives us the pole
locations for the product,

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:04.970
H sub a of s times
H sub a of minus s.

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:09.500
We can then simply associate
with the transfer function

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:11.180
H sub a of s.

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:13.490
The poles in the
left half plane,

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:18.200
to generate a stable filter,
and then the ones which

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:21.740
are contributed by the
factor H sub a of minus s

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:26.200
are the corresponding image
poles in the right half plane.

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:31.800
The procedure then is to design
a squared magnitude function.

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:33.810
Talking about a
Butterworth filter,

00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:36.375
we choose these
parameters omega sub c

00:11:36.375 --> 00:11:39.300
and N. That tells us where
the poles are located

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:42.150
on the Butterworth circle.

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:46.320
From the pole locations for
the squared magnitude function,

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:50.700
then we can factor that into
H sub a of s times H sub

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:53.760
a of minus s, by
choosing the poles that

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:56.820
fall in the left half
plane, to give us

00:11:56.820 --> 00:12:01.631
a causal, stable analog filter.

00:12:01.631 --> 00:12:02.130
All right.

00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:05.970
Well, that is an analog filter.

00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:07.830
What we would like
to talk about is

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:10.500
the design of a digital filter.

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:13.140
And the procedure that
we're going to go through

00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:18.600
is to choose a set of specs
for the digital filter,

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:22.230
and then decide on what the
corresponding specifications

00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:25.170
should be for the analog filter,
depending on whether we're

00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:29.130
using impulse invariance or
the bilinear transformation,

00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:32.640
design the analog
filter, and then map

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:36.300
the result to a
digital filter using

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:39.300
one of those two techniques.

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:44.070
So let's choose a set of
digital filter specifications

00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:50.490
for a digital lowpass
filter with a passband which

00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:55.710
occurs for frequencies
now in the digital domain,

00:12:55.710 --> 00:13:03.150
for frequencies below 0.2 pi,
and a stopband region that

00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:07.050
occurs for frequencies
greater than 0.3 pi,

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:10.110
and the transition band then,
of course, is the region

00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:13.370
in between those.

00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:20.060
So, we would like to design
a digital filter, which

00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:24.020
stays within some limits
in this passband region,

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:28.670
drops below some limit, delta
sub s in the stopband region.

00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:32.810
And we'll choose as the
limits in the passband,

00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:37.100
unity for the upper limit and 1
minus delta sub p for the lower

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:38.390
limit.

00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:42.860
Where delta 1 minus
delta sub p might not

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:47.100
and in fact it won't turn out to
be 1 over the square root of 2,

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:50.390
in other words, this
cutoff frequency

00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:54.725
will not necessarily correspond
to the parameter omega sub

00:13:54.725 --> 00:13:57.850
c for the Butterworth filter.

00:13:57.850 --> 00:13:58.350
All right.

00:13:58.350 --> 00:14:01.950
Well, so let's choose a
set of specifications.

00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:05.250
The ones that I've chosen
are the requirement

00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:11.970
that the frequency response
characteristic be within 1db

00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:14.340
of unity in the passband.

00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:17.160
In other words, the requirement
that 1 minus deltas sub

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:20.970
p be greater than or
equal to minus 1db.

00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:26.080
So this deviation
must be less than 1db.

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:28.800
And then the requirement
that in the stopband

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:31.260
the frequency response
characteristic

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:35.550
is below minus 15db.

00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:38.580
In other words, the
stopband attenuation

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:45.090
for frequencies greater than 0.3
pi is greater than minus 15db.

00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:48.270
It's further down
than minus 15db.

00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:52.500
So delta sub s is less than
or equal to minus 15db.

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:55.980
The one other specification
that we'll impose,

00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:59.220
or in fact, it's really
a consequence that

00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:02.070
will result from using
a Butterworth filter,

00:15:02.070 --> 00:15:07.800
is the fact that the frequency
characteristic is monotonic.

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:12.030
So we have the passband
edge, the stopband edge,

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:15.330
the passband ripple
or deviation,

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:18.700
and the stopband
ripple or deviation.

00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:24.240
And we can, of course,
rewrite these specifications

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:30.240
in terms of requirements on the
transfer function or frequency

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:36.420
response, the magnitude
of the frequency response.

00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:41.760
The requirement that the
deviation be less than 1db

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:45.510
in the passband is
the requirement then

00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:49.680
that 20 log to the base 10 of
the magnitude of the frequency

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:51.030
response--

00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:53.270
that's the deviation db--

00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:58.425
be greater than or equal to
minus 1, or that the magnitude

00:15:58.425 --> 00:16:03.650
be greater than or equal
to 10 to the minus 0.05.

00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:06.960
And of course, we wanted
also to be less than unity,

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:09.110
and that's an implied condition.

00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:11.210
So it must be less
than unity, and it

00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:14.740
must be greater than or
equal to 10 to the minus 0.05

00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:19.100
for frequencies
from 0 to 0.2 pi.

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:21.560
So in particular,
since it's monotonic,

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:28.280
we'll impose that condition
at the frequency point 0.2 pi,

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:30.520
corresponding to the
end of the stopband

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:33.590
and the beginning of
the transition band.

00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:36.770
The second condition
that we impose

00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:40.980
is the condition
that by the time

00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:45.340
we get to omega
equal to 0.3 pi, we

00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:49.780
would like the frequency
response to be down at least 15

00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:52.810
db, and more if possible.

00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:56.300
But the condition
is that the 20 log

00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:59.980
to the base 10 of the magnitude
at omega equal to 0.3 pi

00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:04.310
must be less than or
equal to minus 15.

00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:07.720
So this says we must be
further down than 15 db,

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:11.433
or we can translate that into
a condition on the magnitude,

00:17:11.433 --> 00:17:13.599
so that the magnitude of
that frequency is less than

00:17:13.599 --> 00:17:18.790
or equal to 10 to
the minus 0.75.

00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:22.319
Well, let's consider two--

00:17:22.319 --> 00:17:25.589
we want to consider
two design procedures.

00:17:25.589 --> 00:17:30.360
Let's first consider the impulse
invariant design procedure,

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:34.590
in which case we would like to
convert these specifications

00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:40.800
on the digital filter to
corresponding specifications

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:44.050
on the analog filter.

00:17:44.050 --> 00:17:47.500
Now, we know that
from discussions

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:52.120
that we've had previously that
if we have an analog frequency

00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:57.130
response and we apply impulse
invariance to the impulse

00:17:57.130 --> 00:18:01.630
response, the digital
frequency response consists

00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:05.920
of the analog frequency
response scaled in frequency so

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:09.940
that capital Omega is equal
to little omega divided

00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:16.775
by capital T. And then
that scaled replica of H

00:18:16.775 --> 00:18:23.950
sub a added to itself delayed
by little omega equal to 2 pi, 4

00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:24.790
pi, et cetera.

00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:28.210
That is multiples of 2 pi.

00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:36.220
So, that means then that
the digital filter is scaled

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:39.310
repeated replicas of
the analog filter,

00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:44.380
and so we would choose
the analog filter

00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:48.760
to have similar specifications
to the digital filter,

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:53.830
but with the corresponding
frequency parameters dictated

00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:57.610
by this transformation, capital
Omega equal to little omega,

00:18:57.610 --> 00:19:05.260
divided by capital T. Well, that
of course neglects aliasing,

00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:08.980
and in fact as we go through
the impulse invariant design,

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:11.890
we'll initially
neglect aliasing.

00:19:11.890 --> 00:19:17.800
And a rationale for doing this
or a reason why, in fact, it's

00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:20.770
not unreasonable to
do that, will emerge

00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:22.439
as we go through the example.

00:19:22.439 --> 00:19:23.980
So for the time
being, in fact, we're

00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:27.310
going to neglect
aliasing, so that we'll

00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:31.030
think of the analog and
digital frequency responses

00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:34.450
as simply related by this
substitution of frequency

00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:37.210
variable, capital Omega
equal to little omega

00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:40.480
divided by capital T.

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:49.230
Well, that leads us then to
the analog frequency response

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:52.720
which I've depicted here.

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:57.220
We had a factor of 1 over
capital T in the amplitude

00:19:57.220 --> 00:20:00.230
of this expression.

00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:03.340
So for the digital
filter to result

00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:06.970
with an amplitude
of unity at dc,

00:20:06.970 --> 00:20:11.425
we would scale the analog
frequency response by capital

00:20:11.425 --> 00:20:18.620
T. So the important values
then in capital Omega

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:23.870
are the ones corresponding to
little omega equal to 0.2 pi,

00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:27.290
or since capital Omega is
equal to little omega divided

00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:33.170
by capital T. We have a passband
edge occurring at capital

00:20:33.170 --> 00:20:36.310
Omega equal to 0.2
pi over capital T,

00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:42.250
and a stopband edge equal
to 0.3 pi over capital T.

00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:46.660
At this passband edge,
according to the specifications

00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:49.600
on the digital
filter that we want,

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:53.530
we would like the frequency
response for frequencies

00:20:53.530 --> 00:20:54.500
below this--

00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:56.560
In other words,
in the passband--

00:20:56.560 --> 00:21:00.130
to be between capital T
and capital T times 10

00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:02.080
to the minus 0.05.

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:04.630
That's the guarantee that
we have less than 1 db

00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:06.610
ripple in the passband.

00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:10.000
And for frequencies
greater than 0.3 pi,

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.940
we would like to be
below capital T times 10

00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:14.950
to the minus 0.75.

00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:19.330
That's the guarantee that
we're down 15 db or more

00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:21.880
in the stopband.

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:26.620
The way I've drawn it here,
I've implied that I will exactly

00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:29.980
meet the specifications
at the passband edge,

00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:31.690
and exactly meet
the specifications

00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:33.550
at the stopband edge.

00:21:33.550 --> 00:21:39.550
You can imagine, of course,
that if I did that and then

00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:44.350
converted to a digital filter
using impulse invariance

00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:48.340
that there would be an
effect due to aliasing, which

00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:51.610
in fact would result
in my not meeting

00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:55.450
exactly the specifications
at the stopband edge.

00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:59.870
And that's a point that we'll
deal with in a few minutes.

00:21:59.870 --> 00:22:02.740
All right, well now we
have our specifications.

00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:06.220
Let me incidentally
point out that there's

00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:10.990
this parameter capital T
that we're carrying around.

00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:15.730
And as I'll justify partly
on the basis of this example,

00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:20.510
the parameter capital T is
an irrelevant parameter.

00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:22.810
It's a parameter
that will disappear.

00:22:22.810 --> 00:22:26.800
We'll carry it through with
us for this one example.

00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:29.800
But for other
examples and problems

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:33.340
that you work through
the study guide,

00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:35.320
you should have
absorbed the fact

00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:38.080
that capital T is irrelevant,
and in fact capital

00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:40.720
T can be chosen equal to unity.

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:43.120
But let's carry it
through in this example,

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:47.300
and just see how it disappears.

00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:47.800
All right.

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:53.710
Well, so we want the
analog Butterworth filter

00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:56.360
meaning these specifications.

00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:59.830
And we want it at
omega equal to 0

00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:03.460
to have a gain magnitude squared
function to be T squared,

00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:06.100
so that the magnitude
is T. So here we

00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:11.590
have the form then of the
analog Butterworth filter.

00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:15.310
And in order to meet
these specifications

00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:20.930
at this frequency and this one,
we then have two equations.

00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:24.650
One equation says
that at capital Omega

00:23:24.650 --> 00:23:28.680
equal to 0.2 pi
over capital T, we

00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:35.450
would like the value of
the magnitude function

00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:38.480
to be T times 10
to the minus 0.05,

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:41.450
which implies that
this denominator should

00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:46.438
be equal to 10 to the 0.1.

00:23:46.438 --> 00:23:50.160
Second of all, at the
stopband frequency,

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:54.510
0.3 pi divided by
capital T, the fact

00:23:54.510 --> 00:24:00.480
that we want the magnitude to
be T times 10 to the minus 0.75

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:05.410
implies the magnitude squared
is of course the square of that.

00:24:05.410 --> 00:24:12.300
And we want then the denominator
to be equal to 10 to the 1.5.

00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:15.500
So we have two points that
we're trying to nail down.

00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:20.020
We have two parameters,
omega sub c and N.

00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:22.330
From these two points that
we're trying to nail down,

00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:24.520
we get two equations.

00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:28.510
And we can now solve these
equations for our parameters,

00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:31.690
omega sub c and capital N.

00:24:31.690 --> 00:24:35.200
Well, if we do that, and it's
a little tedious to do it,

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:37.150
let me point out
incidentally since we're

00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:39.940
trying to keep track
of this capital T,

00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:44.080
that capital T drops
down into the numerator

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:49.300
and so, in fact, we can solve
for capital N and omega sub

00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:51.910
c times capital
T. In other words,

00:24:51.910 --> 00:24:55.570
we can just move this
down here algebraically.

00:24:55.570 --> 00:24:58.990
And so we have then instead
of the parameter omega sub c,

00:24:58.990 --> 00:25:03.730
we have the parameter omega
sub c times capital T.

00:25:03.730 --> 00:25:07.090
If you grind through
these two equations,

00:25:07.090 --> 00:25:12.640
what results is a value for N
equal to 5.8858 and probably

00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:14.170
some other digits.

00:25:14.170 --> 00:25:20.130
And omega sub c capital
T equal to 0.70474.

00:25:20.130 --> 00:25:24.220
And we could imagine
that at this point

00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:31.130
we're done, except
that the parameter N

00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:35.410
corresponding to the order
of the filter, of course,

00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:38.000
has to be an integer.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:43.000
So, what that means is that
we can't use the value of N

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.920
as I've indicated here.

00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:47.790
We need an integer value.

00:25:47.790 --> 00:25:51.500
Also if we were to round
this down or truncate

00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:55.860
it down to a choice
of N equal to 5,

00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:58.410
then since the
order is lower you

00:25:58.410 --> 00:26:00.480
can imagine that the
filter characteristics

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:02.200
won't be as good.

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:06.540
In other words, we're not going
to meet these specifications.

00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:12.600
So the other choice then is to
use instead of this value of N,

00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:15.540
use a value of N equal to 6.

00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:21.190
In other words, round up
to the next integer value.

00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:26.550
And if we do that then
these two equations

00:26:26.550 --> 00:26:30.010
will no longer be satisfied.

00:26:30.010 --> 00:26:32.590
We're now using a
higher order filter

00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:35.550
than these equations
would dictate.

00:26:35.550 --> 00:26:37.380
Of course, we're using
an integer order,

00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:39.120
because that's what we need.

00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:44.710
We're using a
sixth order filter.

00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:51.040
And what that means is that
if we choose N equal to 6,

00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:56.130
we can satisfy this equation,
or we can satisfy this equation,

00:26:56.130 --> 00:26:57.850
but we can't satisfy
both of them.

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:03.570
Well, which one
should we try to meet

00:27:03.570 --> 00:27:07.440
and which one should we exceed?

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:09.840
Well, we know that
with impulse invariance

00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:14.460
there is the issue of aliasing.

00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:17.850
And so in fact, in
impulse invariant design

00:27:17.850 --> 00:27:22.530
it will often happen that
although we design exactly

00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:25.370
to meet the stopband
specifications,

00:27:25.370 --> 00:27:27.030
the stopband
specifications won't

00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:29.400
be met because of aliasing.

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:33.500
Consequently, given the
flexibility that we have,

00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:36.870
due to the fact that we can
actually implement a higher

00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:38.610
order filter than
these equations

00:27:38.610 --> 00:27:42.420
dictate, to compensate
for aliasing

00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:47.580
we can exceed the
stopband specifications

00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:51.840
and meet exactly the
passband specifications.

00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:56.940
So if we substitute
for N, N equals 6

00:27:56.940 --> 00:28:03.280
into this equation
that then requires

00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:07.180
that omega sub c T be
such that we exactly

00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:11.950
meet the passband
specifications, in which case

00:28:11.950 --> 00:28:13.600
this equation won't be met.

00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:15.970
In fact, what will
happen at the stopband

00:28:15.970 --> 00:28:19.240
edge is that the
stopband specifications

00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:21.490
will be exceeded.

00:28:21.490 --> 00:28:27.580
If we do this, then we
have for the equation

00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:31.210
that we solve for
omega sub c T from,

00:28:31.210 --> 00:28:37.150
the equation which specified the
passband edge, which is where

00:28:37.150 --> 00:28:39.310
we're going to meet the specs.

00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:45.370
And what results then is for
omega sub c T, this value,

00:28:45.370 --> 00:28:48.490
rather than the previous
value that had been obtained

00:28:48.490 --> 00:28:51.670
from the two equations.

00:28:51.670 --> 00:28:55.490
Well, from these
parameters then,

00:28:55.490 --> 00:29:00.060
we have that omega sub c is
0.7032 divided by capital T.

00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:05.610
We can substitute these
parameters into the form

00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:09.285
for the squared magnitude
function, H sub a of s times H

00:29:09.285 --> 00:29:12.660
sub a of minus s,
and actually it's

00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:16.620
this raised to the 2N,
which is the 2 times

00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:19.530
sixth power, which
is the 12th power.

00:29:19.530 --> 00:29:24.420
So this then is the form for
the analog squared magnitude

00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:27.100
function.

00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:30.700
Now notice that the
parameter capital T still

00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:32.050
hasn't disappeared.

00:29:32.050 --> 00:29:32.770
We still have it.

00:29:32.770 --> 00:29:35.020
We have it there,
and we have it here.

00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:39.270
But notice that when we
substitute in for omega sub c,

00:29:39.270 --> 00:29:41.590
this number divided
by capital T if you

00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:45.340
track through that
algebra, capital T

00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:50.200
reappears in this expression
as a multiplier on s.

00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:53.770
That is we had 0.7032
divided by capital T.

00:29:53.770 --> 00:29:56.620
That gets reflected back
up into this numerator,

00:29:56.620 --> 00:29:59.650
so that we have s
times capital T. Well,

00:29:59.650 --> 00:30:02.800
let's see what that means.

00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:06.500
Suppose that capital
T were equal to 1.

00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:12.060
And we got an analog impulse
response, H sub a of T,

00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:14.790
or the system
function H sub a of s.

00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:21.960
If instead we
reinserted capital T

00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:24.880
and considered H
sub a of s times

00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:31.610
capital T multiplied
by capital T

00:30:31.610 --> 00:30:34.760
that impulse response would
be related to this one

00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:37.046
by simply a time scaling.

00:30:37.046 --> 00:30:38.420
In other words,
this one would be

00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:44.660
replaced by H sub a of t
divided by capital T. Well,

00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:49.280
let's look at this and ask
what happens when we sample it

00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:52.910
at samples spaced by capital T.

00:30:52.910 --> 00:30:55.850
So, we look at this
impulse response

00:30:55.850 --> 00:30:59.230
with T replaced
by n times capital

00:30:59.230 --> 00:31:02.932
T, as we've specified here.

00:31:02.932 --> 00:31:05.015
And we observe that no
matter what we pick capital

00:31:05.015 --> 00:31:08.750
T to be that
parameter disappears.

00:31:08.750 --> 00:31:11.990
Because little t
equal to n times

00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:15.380
capital T gives
us samples H sub a

00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:19.730
of n, which are exactly the
same samples that we would

00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:23.600
get no matter how we chose
the parameter capital T,

00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:26.240
or equivalently whether or
not we chose the parameter

00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:30.020
capital T equal to unity.

00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:32.570
I think that it requires
a little reflection

00:31:32.570 --> 00:31:35.240
to absorb this point.

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:39.980
It's basically tied to the fact
that the frequency response

00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:42.440
is specified for
the digital filter,

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:44.420
not for the analog filter.

00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:46.940
And specifying the
frequency response

00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:49.160
for the digital
filter, in effect,

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:55.340
specifies capital Omega
times capital T. Well,

00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:59.480
I leave it to you to
think about this a little.

00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:03.880
But the important point is
that, in fact this parameter

00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:07.940
T, if we specify
the filter in terms

00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:11.270
of digital specifications,
this parameter capital T

00:32:11.270 --> 00:32:14.760
is really irrelevant.

00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:15.260
All right.

00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:20.190
Well, so here is
our analog design.

00:32:20.190 --> 00:32:26.190
And we can obtain H
sub a of s from this,

00:32:26.190 --> 00:32:28.320
according to the
method that we talked

00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:30.720
about previously taking
the left half plane

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:33.120
poles of this expression.

00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:35.730
Converting those
to a digital filter

00:32:35.730 --> 00:32:39.300
by using the transformation
that we discussed

00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:42.030
in the previous two
lectures, expanding,

00:32:42.030 --> 00:32:45.300
for example, in terms
of residues and poles,

00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:49.380
and then applying the impulse
invariant transformation.

00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:59.160
And if we do that, what results
is a digital lowpass filter,

00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:02.280
which was the lowpass filter
that we set out to design.

00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:06.330
And let me just show how
those specifications,

00:33:06.330 --> 00:33:09.510
or how that design comes out.

00:33:09.510 --> 00:33:14.040
So this, for the example that
we've been talking about,

00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:20.220
is a graph of the frequency
response characteristics.

00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:24.570
Here is the magnitude as a
function of digital frequency

00:33:24.570 --> 00:33:25.920
omega.

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:29.130
And here is the same
frequency response

00:33:29.130 --> 00:33:32.180
plotted in terms of db.

00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:37.340
And we see that we had
in the specifications

00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:45.400
a passband edge at 0.2 pi,
a stopband edge at 0.3 pi.

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:51.190
At 0.2 pi we asked that
the gain be down by 1db.

00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:55.840
And of course, it's hard to tell
exactly that we're down 1db,

00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:57.640
but in fact we are.

00:33:57.640 --> 00:34:01.930
At omega equal to 0.3
pi, our specification

00:34:01.930 --> 00:34:07.900
was that we wanted
to be down by 15 db.

00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:10.810
In fact, we overcompensated,
because of the fact

00:34:10.810 --> 00:34:14.650
that we had to round the order
of the filter up to an integer

00:34:14.650 --> 00:34:15.860
value.

00:34:15.860 --> 00:34:20.360
And you can see, in fact, that
if you look at this carefully,

00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:25.929
we exceed the specifications
of 0.3 pi by a little bit.

00:34:25.929 --> 00:34:30.460
In other words, we're down
by a little more than 15 db.

00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:32.620
In fact, for this
particular filter

00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:35.980
you can imagine that the
effective aliasing is, in fact,

00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:37.239
rather minimal.

00:34:37.239 --> 00:34:42.340
Because this frequency response,
by the time we get out to pi

00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:43.870
is essentially 0.

00:34:43.870 --> 00:34:48.014
Here we're down to minus 75 db.

00:34:48.014 --> 00:34:49.389
And that's, of
course, the amount

00:34:49.389 --> 00:34:52.040
that would get aliased back in.

00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:55.960
So this is the resulting filter
frequency characteristics

00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:59.560
for the impulse
invariant design where

00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:06.840
we exceed slightly the
stopband edge specifications.

00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:10.050
Now, the next thing
that I'd like to go onto

00:35:10.050 --> 00:35:14.430
is the corresponding
design, the design

00:35:14.430 --> 00:35:17.100
or the corresponding
Butterworth filter,

00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:19.770
now using the bilinear
transformation

00:35:19.770 --> 00:35:23.280
rather than using
impulse invariance.

00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:29.160
I remind you that the basic
idea with the bilinear

00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:34.770
transformation, as we've
discussed in the last lectures,

00:35:34.770 --> 00:35:44.790
is that we basically choose
the analog specifications

00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:48.330
by pre-warping the
critical frequencies

00:35:48.330 --> 00:35:53.730
for the digital filter through
the nonlinear distortion

00:35:53.730 --> 00:35:57.970
curve corresponding to the
bilinear transformation.

00:35:57.970 --> 00:36:01.839
So, we would start here
for the digital filter.

00:36:01.839 --> 00:36:04.380
Of course, here we're talking
about a monotonic filter rather

00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:05.940
than one that ripples.

00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:09.420
But we have a passband
edge at 0.2 pi,

00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:12.120
a stopband edge at 0.3 pi.

00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:14.850
We reflect those
critical frequencies

00:36:14.850 --> 00:36:18.090
through the arctangent
curve to obtain

00:36:18.090 --> 00:36:21.090
the corresponding
critical frequencies

00:36:21.090 --> 00:36:25.320
for the analog
Butterworth filter.

00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:27.990
When the analog Butterworth
filter is designed,

00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:31.770
we then obtain the
digital Butterworth filter

00:36:31.770 --> 00:36:35.700
by transforming this filter
back through the bilinear

00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:38.390
transformation.

00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:47.070
So, let's look at how
this design works then.

00:36:47.070 --> 00:36:52.590
We have, as we've just
reflected on that curve,

00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:58.680
we begin with the digital
frequency specifications,

00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:02.310
reflect those through the
bilinear warping curve

00:37:02.310 --> 00:37:07.590
to the analog specifications,
and consequently

00:37:07.590 --> 00:37:09.840
the critical frequencies--

00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:13.650
and let me emphasize
first of all that

00:37:13.650 --> 00:37:16.500
just as with impulse
invariance, you

00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:18.600
can show that the
parameter capital

00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:21.090
T is an irrelevant parameter.

00:37:21.090 --> 00:37:24.690
We could, in fact, carry
it all the way through.

00:37:24.690 --> 00:37:28.680
And what would happen is that
we would find that no matter

00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:33.600
what we chose capital T to
be, the digital filter design

00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:35.920
that resulted would
be exactly the same.

00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:39.330
So in fact, for this example
I'll work through it simply

00:37:39.330 --> 00:37:41.900
with capital T equal to 1.

00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:42.400
All right.

00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:47.070
With capital T equal
to 1, we reflect

00:37:47.070 --> 00:37:51.390
these critical frequencies
into this passband frequency

00:37:51.390 --> 00:37:54.060
edge and this stopband edge.

00:37:54.060 --> 00:37:57.900
And consequently,
the analog filter--

00:37:57.900 --> 00:38:01.290
this is the analog filter--

00:38:01.290 --> 00:38:05.640
the analog filter that
we design is one that

00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:08.340
meets these specifications.

00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:14.100
And consequently we have,
again, the two equations

00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:19.840
that say that at
the passband edge,

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:25.730
we want the magnitude to
be within 1db of unity.

00:38:25.730 --> 00:38:28.930
And at the stopband edge,
we want the magnitude

00:38:28.930 --> 00:38:34.940
to be less than, down
by more than 15 db.

00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:36.830
And the two
equations that result

00:38:36.830 --> 00:38:40.580
are these, exactly the same as
we had in the impulse invariant

00:38:40.580 --> 00:38:45.150
case, except that the
frequencies are different.

00:38:45.150 --> 00:38:49.820
So now substituting in for the
form of the analog Butterworth

00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:54.710
filter into these expressions,
and setting this up

00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:59.210
for equality in
these expressions,

00:38:59.210 --> 00:39:03.650
what results then are
the two equations which

00:39:03.650 --> 00:39:08.390
are identical to
the two equations

00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:11.030
that we had for the
impulse invariant design,

00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:17.930
except that the frequencies at
which the passband and stopband

00:39:17.930 --> 00:39:23.620
edges of the analog Butterworth
filter fall are different.

00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:27.050
They're different because of the
warping of the bilinear curve,

00:39:27.050 --> 00:39:29.670
or the pre-warping
that we have to apply.

00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:32.660
So, these are the two equations.

00:39:32.660 --> 00:39:40.700
And if we solve these two
equations for capital N,

00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:45.840
the resulting value for capital
N is 5.3 and some digits.

00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:48.350
Notice incidentally
that it's less

00:39:48.350 --> 00:39:51.020
than it was for the
impulse invariant design.

00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:53.270
And in general that's
a characteristic

00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:55.310
of the bilinear transformation.

00:39:55.310 --> 00:40:00.452
But so it's less, but
it is not an integer.

00:40:00.452 --> 00:40:01.910
So the first thing
we can ask again

00:40:01.910 --> 00:40:04.940
is, could we just simply
truncate this down or round it

00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:07.850
down to the nearest integer
value, in other words,

00:40:07.850 --> 00:40:09.380
N equals 5.

00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:11.750
But of course if
we did that, then

00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:14.390
we wouldn't be able
to pick omega sub c,

00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:17.510
so that these equations
were satisfied or so

00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:20.970
that the specifications
were met or exceeded.

00:40:20.970 --> 00:40:26.510
So in fact, we need to choose,
we have to choose N equal to 6.

00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:30.830
We have to choose the next
highest integer value.

00:40:30.830 --> 00:40:34.550
Choosing N equal to 6,
we then have the choice

00:40:34.550 --> 00:40:38.990
of exactly satisfying
this equation,

00:40:38.990 --> 00:40:42.440
or exactly satisfying
this equation, or in fact

00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:44.150
not satisfying
either one of them,

00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:47.780
but playing back and
forth between the two.

00:40:47.780 --> 00:40:51.050
Well let's do it in
a particular way.

00:40:51.050 --> 00:40:55.250
We can, for example,
exactly meet

00:40:55.250 --> 00:40:57.830
the stopband specifications.

00:40:57.830 --> 00:41:01.110
In other words, we can use
N equals 6 in this equation,

00:41:01.110 --> 00:41:04.400
and solve for omega
sub c, in which case

00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:08.540
the passband specifications
will be exceeded.

00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:10.770
Recall that in the
impulse invariant design

00:41:10.770 --> 00:41:12.630
we did it the other way around.

00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:16.580
We met exactly the passband
specifications, in which case

00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:19.250
the stopband specs
were exceeded.

00:41:19.250 --> 00:41:21.380
But there we had a good
reason for doing that.

00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:24.920
The reason that we did that
is because we knew in advance

00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:29.270
that in any case the passband
specs wouldn't be met exactly,

00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:31.340
because of the
effect of aliasing.

00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:33.110
For the bilinear
transformation, we

00:41:33.110 --> 00:41:35.180
don't have a problem
with aliasing.

00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:40.130
So, in fact, we're free to play
with this flexibility in a more

00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:41.881
general way.

00:41:41.881 --> 00:41:42.380
All right.

00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:46.750
Well, in any case then if
we meet the stopband specs,

00:41:46.750 --> 00:41:49.320
substituting N equals
6 in this equation,

00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:53.030
and solving for omega
sub c; we end up

00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:58.910
with a value for omega
sub c, which is 0.76622.

00:41:58.910 --> 00:42:03.590
And so this then gives us
the parameters omega sub c

00:42:03.590 --> 00:42:09.530
and N for the analog
Butterworth filter.

00:42:09.530 --> 00:42:12.770
We can then use
those specifications,

00:42:12.770 --> 00:42:15.790
again to generate
the pole pattern

00:42:15.790 --> 00:42:20.060
for the squared magnitude
function H sub a

00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:23.480
of s times H sub a of minus s.

00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:30.820
Factor this by choosing the left
half plane poles in s plane,

00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:34.810
and then mapping this function
to a digital filter using

00:42:34.810 --> 00:42:36.760
the bilinear transformation.

00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:42.340
And let's now look at how this
filter comes out as compared

00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:49.060
with the digital Butterworth
filter that we obtained

00:42:49.060 --> 00:42:52.090
by using impulse invariance.

00:42:52.090 --> 00:42:59.710
Well again, I have a display of
the magnitude of the frequency

00:42:59.710 --> 00:43:03.105
response and also
the gain in db.

00:43:05.770 --> 00:43:08.020
From what you may
recall from the curve

00:43:08.020 --> 00:43:12.010
that I showed previously,
this looks roughly the same.

00:43:12.010 --> 00:43:16.900
It's a monotonic
filter and drops off.

00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:19.780
It's down by some
amount at 0.2 pi,

00:43:19.780 --> 00:43:24.820
and the stopband is at 0.3 pi.

00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:27.250
In particular, according
to the specifications,

00:43:27.250 --> 00:43:32.860
we wanted this to be down by
no more than 1db at 0.2 pi.

00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:38.710
Well, it's hard again to say
that this is 1db or less.

00:43:38.710 --> 00:43:41.560
But if we look at
0.3 pi, we can see

00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:48.160
that this is in fact
exactly down by 15 db.

00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:51.700
And that's the way
that we designed it.

00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:55.750
We designed it to exactly
meet the stopband cutoff

00:43:55.750 --> 00:43:59.280
and exceed the passband cutoff.

00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:03.960
And then the frequency response
continues on from there.

00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:06.570
It's interesting, in fact,
to compare the design

00:44:06.570 --> 00:44:11.130
that we got from the bilinear
transformation with the design

00:44:11.130 --> 00:44:14.860
that we got previously
with impulse invariance.

00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:20.350
And let me do that by
superimposing the two of them.

00:44:20.350 --> 00:44:22.500
So that the one that
I'm putting on now

00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:26.400
is the impulse invariant
design, and let

00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:30.372
me just lay them on
top of each other.

00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:37.006
OK.

00:44:37.006 --> 00:44:40.030
You can see incidentally
that looking at the frequency

00:44:40.030 --> 00:44:43.540
response on a magnitude
plot there, in fact,

00:44:43.540 --> 00:44:44.830
are some differences.

00:44:44.830 --> 00:44:47.170
This line has gotten
a little thicker.

00:44:47.170 --> 00:44:50.140
That is, the two don't
exactly superimpose.

00:44:50.140 --> 00:44:53.350
But you can't really
see the differences.

00:44:53.350 --> 00:44:58.060
Whereas you can when we look
at this on a logarithmic plot.

00:44:58.060 --> 00:45:01.810
In particular, this is
the frequency response

00:45:01.810 --> 00:45:05.720
that corresponded to the
bilinear transformation.

00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:07.960
This is the frequency
response that corresponded

00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:10.270
to impulse invariance.

00:45:10.270 --> 00:45:14.050
And this is, in general,
a characteristic

00:45:14.050 --> 00:45:17.610
of the use of the
bilinear transformation.

00:45:17.610 --> 00:45:21.280
It's a result essentially
of the frequency distortion,

00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:25.360
because we've
taken the frequency

00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:29.590
axis and the continuous
time frequency axis.

00:45:29.590 --> 00:45:32.470
As you run along it
at a constant rate,

00:45:32.470 --> 00:45:39.400
it gets compressed more and
more along the digital frequency

00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:40.120
axis.

00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:41.140
That wasn't well said.

00:45:41.140 --> 00:45:44.920
But what I really mean to
say is as we walk along here

00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:48.850
at a constant rate, the farther
we walk, the faster we're

00:45:48.850 --> 00:45:51.200
running along the j omega axis.

00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:57.970
And that's why, in fact, the use
of the bilinear transformation

00:45:57.970 --> 00:46:03.580
on a lowpass filter will
give better attenuation

00:46:03.580 --> 00:46:07.030
at the higher frequencies
than impulse invariance will.

00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:09.220
And I don't know
if you can really

00:46:09.220 --> 00:46:18.400
see the fact that the
passband specs were exceeded

00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:20.990
for the bilinear design.

00:46:20.990 --> 00:46:24.250
In fact, when you look at these
view graphs in the study guide,

00:46:24.250 --> 00:46:28.420
I think you'll see that
for impulse invariance

00:46:28.420 --> 00:46:32.440
the curve is slightly lower
than it is for the bilinear

00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:34.810
transformation

00:46:34.810 --> 00:46:36.400
OK well, look.

00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:43.750
This is a simple example that
hopefully at least illustrates

00:46:43.750 --> 00:46:46.960
for you the basic
procedure involved

00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:51.460
in carrying through a design
of an infinite impulse response

00:46:51.460 --> 00:46:55.600
filter using impulse
invariance and the bilinear

00:46:55.600 --> 00:46:57.610
transformation.

00:46:57.610 --> 00:47:01.840
There are other examples that
are considered in the text.

00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:08.900
There is a discussion of
digital Chebyshev filters,

00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:11.660
in other words digital
designs beginning

00:47:11.660 --> 00:47:13.850
from an analog Chebyshev filter.

00:47:13.850 --> 00:47:15.350
And you'll also
have an opportunity

00:47:15.350 --> 00:47:20.235
to carry through some
designs in the study guide.

00:47:20.235 --> 00:47:24.040
A point that I would
like to mention briefly

00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:26.540
is that most of the
discussion, in fact

00:47:26.540 --> 00:47:29.260
all of the discussion
that we've gone through,

00:47:29.260 --> 00:47:33.410
has focused entirely
on lowpass filters.

00:47:33.410 --> 00:47:36.310
In fact, the
discussion generalizes

00:47:36.310 --> 00:47:41.030
in a fairly straightforward
way to bandpass, bandstop,

00:47:41.030 --> 00:47:43.000
highpass, et cetera filters.

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:47.530
In particular, as is discussed
in some detail in the text,

00:47:47.530 --> 00:47:51.400
there are a class of
frequency transformations

00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:54.430
that allow lowpass
designs to get

00:47:54.430 --> 00:48:00.010
converted to bandstop, bandpass,
highpass, et cetera designs.

00:48:00.010 --> 00:48:05.980
So this concludes our
discussion of design procedures

00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:10.380
for recursive or
infinite impulse response

00:48:10.380 --> 00:48:11.860
digital filters.

00:48:11.860 --> 00:48:17.470
In the next lecture I'll discuss
the design of finite impulse

00:48:17.470 --> 00:48:20.830
response filters,
and in particular

00:48:20.830 --> 00:48:25.330
introduce a number of
designs, one of which

00:48:25.330 --> 00:48:28.020
corresponds to a class
of algorithmic designs.

00:48:28.020 --> 00:48:30.500
Thank you.

00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:33.250
