ALAN OPPENHEIM: Well,
in the last lecture

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.130
we introduced the z transform.

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.860
In this lecture, I'd
like to go backwards.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.630
That is, I'd like to introduce
the inverse z transform

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:11.510
and demonstrate some of its
properties with a few examples.

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:17.210
To begin with, let me remind you
of the z transform relationship

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.970
as we talked about it
in the last lecture.

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.970
The z transform X of
z of a sequence x of n

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:33.130
is given by the sum of x of
n times z to the minus n.

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.710
The inverse z
transform, of course,

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.120
is the relationship,
or the set of rules,

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:45.970
that allow us to obtain x
of n the original sequence

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.850
from its z transform, x of z.

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.570
There are a variety
of methods that

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.130
can be used for implementing
the inverse z transform.

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.610
Some of them are somewhat
informal methods.

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.660
And others, one in particular
which we'll talk about,

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.229
is a somewhat formal method.

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.350
To begin with, an
informal method

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.020
and a method that,
in fact, most of us

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.290
tend to use the most
often is a method

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:25.350
that we could refer to as the
inspection method for computing

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.350
the inverse z transform.

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.770
Basically, the
inspection method says

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:37.230
if we've computed a z
transform from a sequence,

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.630
then by looking at
that z transform,

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.130
we can recognize more or less
by inspection the sequence

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.400
that that z transform came from.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.360
For example, we have
worked several times now

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.300
the computation
of the z transform

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.640
of an exponential
sequence, which

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.290
is a right sided sequence,
and gotten is the answer,

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.550
or the z transform, 1 over 1
minus a z to the minus one,

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.870
with a region of convergence
for the magnitude of z greater

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.790
than the magnitude of a.

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.910
Consequently, having
worked that example,

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.550
if I now present you with
this z transform and ask you

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.280
what sequence generated it.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.470
One way of doing that,
obviously, is by inspection.

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.850
By recognizing that
this sequence generates

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.230
that z transform.

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.050
Another example that
we've worked several times

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:47.630
now is the exponential
sequence, which is left sided.

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.630
That is 0 for n
greater than zero,

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.990
generating the same
ratio of polynomials

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:57.170
as in the right
sided exponential,

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.390
but with a region
of convergence which

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.330
is the interior of
a circle rather than

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.310
in this case where the
region of convergence

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.430
is the exterior of a circle.

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.050
And in fact, it was the
comparison between these two z

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.870
transforms that
caused us to focus

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.000
in the last lecture
on the importance

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.200
of the region of convergence.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:24.660
So this is one method, which
I emphasize again is in fact,

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.480
one of the most common methods.

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.500
That is, just simply recognizing
the z transform as something

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.560
that we've computed
previously from a sequence.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.640
And that obviously also
as you work more examples,

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:43.400
you build up a larger list
of sequences and z transforms

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.140
which pairs what
you can recognize.

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:55.520
The second method for computing
the inverse z transform

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:03.200
is based on the fact that the
z transform relationship is

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.340
basically a power series in z.

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:13.710
That is, if we look back here
at the z transform expression,

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:18.470
this is essentially a power
series relationship which

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:22.880
expands x of z in powers of z.

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.990
Consequently, given
a z transform,

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:31.250
if we can expand it in
terms of powers of z,

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:35.330
then we can pick off the
coefficients in that expansion

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:39.530
as values of the
sequence x of n.

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:43.470
For example, let's
take the sequence,

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:48.622
sorry the z transform x of z,
which is 1 over 1 minus a z

00:05:48.622 --> 00:05:50.830
to the minus 1.

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.700
Or we can rewrite it
as z over z minus a.

00:05:54.700 --> 00:06:00.400
Now this of course
is a z transform

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:04.690
whose inverse we know how
to compute by inspection.

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:07.470
However, we can also
compute the inverse z

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:14.040
transform by expanding this
expression in a power series.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:19.500
Let's divide 1 by 1
minus a z to the minus 1,

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.390
and then recognize
the coefficients

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:26.530
in that expansion as values
of the sequence X of n.

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:28.540
So carrying that out.

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:33.180
We have 1 divided into 1 is 1.

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:38.730
Multiplying back we have 1
minus a z to the minus 1.

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:43.780
Subtracting we then
have a z to the minus 1.

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:50.122
Dividing by 1 we then have
a times z to the minus 1.

00:06:50.122 --> 00:06:55.380
Multiplying down again,
we have a z to the minus 1

00:06:55.380 --> 00:07:00.130
minus a squared
z to the minus 2.

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:05.740
Subtracting we have a
squared z to the minus 2.

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:11.650
Dividing by 1 we have a
squared z to the minus 2.

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:16.360
And if we continue this, we'll
generate terms 1, a times

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:21.500
z to the minus 1, a squared
times z to the minus 2,

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:28.670
a cubed times z to the
minus 3, et cetera.

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:32.800
This series will continue with
an infinite number of terms.

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:40.180
And we can recognize then this
as the expansion of x of z

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:44.770
in the form the sum of x
n times z to the minus n.

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:51.550
Consequently, we can recognize
that apparently x of n

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:56.290
is 1 at n equal zero, a at
n equals 1, a squared at n

00:07:56.290 --> 00:08:01.070
equals 2, a cubed
at n equals 3, etc.

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:04.730
Of course, there
are lots of ways

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:10.070
of expanding a function
like this in a power series.

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:15.200
For example, if I simply reverse
the order of these two terms

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:19.850
and carried out the division,
this isn't the series I'd get.

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:24.800
What I'd get instead is the
series, which is minus a

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:28.970
to the minus 1 times z,
minus a to the minus 2 times

00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:34.710
z squared, minus a to the
minus 3 times z cubed, etc.

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:38.640
In that case, if this
was the expansion,

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:41.640
then what I would have to
recognize as the sequence

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:46.790
corresponding to this is
the sequence which is 0 at n

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:48.560
equals zero.

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:53.240
It has no terms of the form z
to the minus a positive power.

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:57.890
So apparently, it's all 0
for n greater than zero.

00:08:57.890 --> 00:09:02.810
And it's minus a to the minus
1 at n equals minus 1, minus a

00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:06.260
to the minus 2 at n
equals minus 2, etc.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:12.140
So in fact, for this example,
I could expand this either

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:18.550
in this power series, or I could
expand it in this power series.

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:23.410
Well, which power series
is the right power series?

00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:27.620
We know in fact that given
just this ratio of polynomials,

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:31.330
there are several choices
for the sequence that it

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:35.550
corresponds to depending on
the region of convergence.

00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:40.620
If I associate as the
region of convergence

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:45.240
the magnitude of z greater
than the magnitude of a,

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:49.940
then it's this power
series that converges.

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:52.740
And this power series diverges.

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:54.620
So for that region
of convergence,

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:58.220
that is with the
magnitude of z greater

00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:01.730
than the magnitude of a as
the region of convergence,

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:03.590
this is the power series.

00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:08.600
And consequently, the
answer is a to the n times

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:11.840
u of n, which of course
is consistent with what

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:14.900
we know already or equivalently
consistent with the inspection

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:16.380
method.

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:19.380
On the other hand, if
the region of convergence

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:24.810
was the magnitude of z less
than the magnitude of a,

00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:28.620
then it's this power
series that converges.

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:30.570
And consequently
in that case, we

00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:35.040
get a left sided sequence, which
again is consistent with what

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:37.350
we know either from
the inspection method

00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:39.180
or equivalently
from the examples

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:42.150
that we've worked before.

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:46.680
One obvious drawback
to the power series

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:49.440
is the fact that
when we generate

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:52.590
the inverse z
transform this way,

00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:57.360
we get the values in the
sequence as individual terms.

00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:03.210
That is, we generate x
of n not in closed form.

00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:05.450
We generate it as a sequence.

00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:07.160
For simple sequences
of course, we

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:10.610
can recognize a closed
form form for that.

00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:12.880
But in more complicated
cases, we can't.

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:17.200
All right.

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:21.260
A third method for
generating the inverse z

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:26.090
transform is
basically an extension

00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:28.970
of the inspection
method, which allows

00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:34.700
us to take a more complicated z
transform expression and expand

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:42.390
it out in terms of terms that
we can recognize by inspection.

00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:46.490
And this method I'll
refer to as the method

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:50.700
based on the partial
fraction expansion.

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:53.910
I assume that some
of you are familiar

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:57.480
with the partial fraction
expansion in general

00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:59.700
for a rational function.

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:02.970
But in case you're not or
in case you're rusty on it,

00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:06.690
let me just quickly review
what the partial fraction

00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:07.960
expansion consists of.

00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:17.330
Let's consider the general
function of a variable,

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:20.540
I'll take as a complex
variable x, which

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:24.200
is a rational function in x.

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:28.280
It is one polynomial in
the numerator divided

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:31.370
by a denominator polynomial.

00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:35.210
And let me remark incidentally
that you shouldn't confuse

00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:38.810
this x with the
sequence values x of n

00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:40.520
that we've been referring to.

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:45.490
This is simply some
arbitrary complex number,

00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:48.570
or complex variable.

00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:55.650
Now I can in general expand
the rational function

00:12:55.650 --> 00:13:03.000
in terms of an expansion
of a form which,

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.490
at least under certain
simple conditions,

00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:12.520
is a sum of terms of
the form of a constant,

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:21.380
Rk divided by x minus
xk, where the x minus xk

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:26.690
are the roots of the
denominator polynomial q of x.

00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:32.860
And these coefficients are
referred to as the residues.

00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:40.290
Now to expand this rational
function in this form

00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:45.420
without additional terms, I need
to apply the restriction, which

00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:48.910
I'll do for the purposes
of this lecture,

00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:52.570
that the order of the
numerator polynomial

00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:56.330
is less than the order of
the denominator polynomial,

00:13:56.330 --> 00:14:00.490
and that in addition,
there are no multiple order

00:14:00.490 --> 00:14:02.890
roots of the
denominator polynomial.

00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:07.510
In other words, the denominator
polynomial is n-th order,

00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:11.290
then the n roots of the
denominator polynomial

00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:13.570
are distinct.

00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:17.980
In the text, there is the
more general discussion

00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:20.380
of the partial
fraction expansion

00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:22.810
when the order of
the numerator is

00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:25.720
greater than or equal to
the order of the denominator

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:28.000
or if there are
multiple order roots.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.530
The essential ideas of
course don't change.

00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:34.480
It's just the mechanics of
implementing the expansion

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:36.100
in the form of the expansion.

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:39.580
So for this lecture we'll
assume that the expansion simply

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:41.340
has terms of this form.

00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:47.430
And this then is referred
to as the partial fraction

00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:51.560
expansion of f of x.

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:55.640
Now how do we get
the coefficients Rk

00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:57.950
in the expansion?

00:14:57.950 --> 00:15:03.450
Well essentially by
recognizing that if we

00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:10.680
multiply f of x by one of
the denominator factors,

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:19.870
say x minus xr, and evaluate
that product of x equals xr.

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:23.890
Then relating that
to this sum, as I've

00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:30.430
indicated here, when
k is equal to r,

00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:34.460
these two factors cancel out.

00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:37.730
When k is not equal
to r, then when

00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:45.060
I substitute x equals xr in
here, then this term vanishes.

00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:50.620
So basically then, what
happens inside this sum is

00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:56.720
that the term inside
this sum is equal to 0

00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:03.950
for k not equal to r, and
it's equal to capital Rr, that

00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:14.090
is the residue at the pole, x
equals xr when k is equal to r.

00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:17.120
So consequently,
there's only one term

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:20.960
left in this sum,
which is capital Rr.

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:25.910
And therefore the residues,
that is capital Rr,

00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:34.900
can be obtained by multiplying
f of x by x minus xr,

00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:38.960
evaluating the result
at x equals xr.

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:41.480
And the resulting
number is the residue

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:46.550
of f of x at the
pole x equals xr.

00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:51.020
That's for the case
of simple order

00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:55.430
poles, that is first order roots
of the denominator polynomial.

00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:58.040
And also for the case when
the order of the numerator

00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:01.820
polynomial is less than or equal
to the order of the denominator

00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:03.470
polynomial.

00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:07.520
And just store away for later,
because I want to refer back

00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:10.260
to this point,
that in particular,

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:12.440
when there are
multiple order poles,

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:16.010
the evaluation of the residue
is somewhat more complicated.

00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:17.930
In particular it
involves computing

00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:19.760
some derivatives, et cetera.

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:23.069
And the more the higher the
multiplicity of the pole,

00:17:23.069 --> 00:17:25.260
the more complicated it is.

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:28.099
And that's a point that
will sneak back at us

00:17:28.099 --> 00:17:30.590
toward the end of the lecture.

00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:35.640
Now this of course is for a
general rational function.

00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:40.890
Let's apply this now to
the inverse z transform.

00:17:40.890 --> 00:17:45.370
Well, we know that
the z transform--

00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:47.940
well let's restrict
ourselves to the case

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:52.260
where the z transform is
a rational function of z

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:55.030
or z to the minus 1.

00:17:55.030 --> 00:18:00.130
And consequently we
can, referring back

00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:04.390
to the general notion of the
partial fraction expansion,

00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:08.330
either think of the
variable z as what

00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:12.100
we're calling x over
there, in which case

00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:17.170
we have an expansion of
the z transform in the form

00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:24.130
of the sum on k of ak
divided by z minus little ak,

00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:27.520
where the little ak's are
the poles, and the capital

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:30.550
Ak's are the residues.

00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:37.360
Alternatively, if we interpret
z to the minus 1 as x, then

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:43.070
we can expand x of z in the
form of some other residues

00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:52.050
Bk divided by z to the minus 1
minus some coefficient, little

00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:52.950
bk.

00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:57.000
Or we can rewrite that
as capital Bk divided

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.940
by 1 minus ak z to the minus 1.

00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:05.280
So here we're
expanding in terms of--

00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:08.880
we're treating the z transform
as a rational function in z.

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:10.590
Here we're treating
the z transform

00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:15.090
as a rational function
in z to the minus 1.

00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:18.150
So what does the
method consist of?

00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:22.920
Well the method consists
of expanding x of z

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:26.190
in terms of simple
terms like this,

00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:28.650
and then using the
inspection method

00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:33.600
to recognize what the
inverse transform is for each

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:35.670
of the individual terms.

00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:38.730
To get the final sequence
then, we add those up.

00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:41.040
That is, we've expressed
the z transform

00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:43.990
as a sum of simple factors.

00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:46.910
So the sequence, the
original sequence,

00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:50.220
we can express as the
sum of the inverse z

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:53.850
transform obtained by the
expect inspection method

00:19:53.850 --> 00:19:56.600
of each of the
individual factors.

00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:57.100
All right.

00:19:57.100 --> 00:20:00.330
Let's just work a simple
example to show you

00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:03.960
what the mechanics are of
this and how it works out.

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:10.980
Let's take an example where
x of z is 1 over 1 minus 1/2

00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:16.470
z to the minus 1 times 1
minus 1/4 z to the minus 1

00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:19.050
with a region of
convergence which

00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:23.990
I'll take as the magnitude
of z greater than a half.

00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:25.610
This has two poles of course.

00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:29.360
One at z equals 1/2, the
other at z equals 1/4.

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:32.940
And the region of convergence
is outside the outermost pole.

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:36.590
So what we expect to get
is a right sided sequence.

00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:40.350
And let's work this
one by treating

00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:46.110
the variable x in our previous
discussion as z to the minus 1.

00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:48.900
And obviously, it doesn't
matter which one we use.

00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:52.110
Although it turns out
actually that depending

00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:54.450
on how you pick it,
you either end up

00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:56.790
with a numerator
polynomial whose order

00:20:56.790 --> 00:20:59.360
is greater than the denominator
polynomial, or the other way

00:20:59.360 --> 00:20:59.860
around.

00:21:02.651 --> 00:21:03.150
OK.

00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:09.880
Well, so we want then to
expand this z transform

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:14.700
in terms of a sum of factors.

00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:18.510
And let's just rewrite
this to make things

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:26.930
a little clearer by multiplying
denominator and numerator by 2,

00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:30.830
by minus 2 rather, and
then also by minus 4.

00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:36.260
We can simply rewrite this as 8
divided by z to minus 1 minus 2

00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:39.110
times z to the minus 1 minus 4.

00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:44.240
So that it's more in the form
of x minus a constant times

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:47.960
x minus another constant.

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:48.560
All right.

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:53.480
Well, so here then we
have the z transform

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:55.640
that we want to expand
in a partial fraction

00:21:55.640 --> 00:22:01.310
expansion in terms of
treating z to the minus 1

00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:06.210
as the complex variable
x in the expansion.

00:22:06.210 --> 00:22:10.460
We have two poles, two roots
of the denominator polynomial,

00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:13.680
one at z to the minus
1 equals 2, the other

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:16.260
at z the minus 1 equals 4.

00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:18.660
So we need to
calculate the residues

00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:20.930
at each of those roots.

00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:26.510
To calculate the residue at
z to the minus 1 equals 2,

00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:27.650
what are the steps?

00:22:27.650 --> 00:22:34.810
Well, we multiply this by
z to the minus 1 minus 2.

00:22:34.810 --> 00:22:38.890
That is, x minus 2 where
x we're interpreting as z

00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:40.960
to the minus 1.

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:49.700
And then evaluate the result
at z to the minus 1 equals 2.

00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:57.550
Well obviously of course, this
term cancels out that term.

00:22:57.550 --> 00:23:00.490
And we want to do that before
we substitute z to the minus 1

00:23:00.490 --> 00:23:02.260
equals 2.

00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:04.360
And then substituting
z to the minus 1

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:10.390
equals 2, we get minus 2 left
over in the denominator divided

00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:11.500
into eight.

00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:17.480
And that's equal to minus 4.

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:21.320
So the residue then
at z to the minus 1

00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:26.650
equals 2 is equal to minus 4.

00:23:26.650 --> 00:23:30.320
Similarly, to calculate
the residue at the root

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:35.020
z to the minus 1 equals
4, we multiply by z

00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:37.470
to the minus 1 minus 4.

00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:41.440
Then these two terms
will cancel out.

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:44.410
Evaluate the resulting
expression at z to the minus 1

00:23:44.410 --> 00:23:46.060
equals 4.

00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:50.350
So we have 4 minus 2
is 2 and to 8 is 4.

00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:53.800
And the residue then at z
to the minus 1 equals 4,

00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:57.010
the residue is equal to 4.

00:23:57.010 --> 00:24:02.080
Consequently, the partial
fraction expansion for x of z,

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:09.850
for this x of z, is
minus 4, minus 4, over z

00:24:09.850 --> 00:24:18.500
to the minus 1 minus 2 plus 4
over z to the minus 1 minus 4.

00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:20.710
Well finally, let's
just put this back

00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:25.630
in a form that is more the
form that we're used to looking

00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:28.106
at the z transform in.

00:24:28.106 --> 00:24:32.450
In particular multiplying
this piece, numerator

00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:37.430
and denominator, by minus 1/2,
we get 2 over 1 minus 1/2 z

00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:39.960
to the minus 1.

00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:44.280
Here, multiplying numerator
and denominator by minus 1/4,

00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:50.320
we get minus 1 over 1
minus 1/4 z to the minus 1.

00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:54.540
And now we've broken x of z
into a form that allows us

00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:57.420
to use the inspection method.

00:24:57.420 --> 00:25:00.510
That is, we can
recognize from this--

00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:03.360
remember that the
region of convergence

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:06.250
was outside a circle.

00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:09.090
So we want to interpret
the region of convergence

00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:11.430
to be the same here.

00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:19.830
So consequently for this piece
we end up with 2 times 1/2

00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:24.810
to the n times u of n.

00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:27.760
That's an n.

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:36.370
And for this piece we end up
with minus 1 times a quarter

00:25:36.370 --> 00:25:40.490
to the n times u of n.

00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:48.380
So by breaking x of z into a
sum of components, simple terms,

00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:51.910
we were then able to apply
the inspection method

00:25:51.910 --> 00:25:58.090
to each one of those to get
the resulting z transform

00:25:58.090 --> 00:26:02.110
in a closed form expression,
or at least the sum

00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:03.975
of some closed form expression.

00:26:06.481 --> 00:26:06.980
All right.

00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:10.910
So that then is
basically an extension

00:26:10.910 --> 00:26:13.010
of the inspection method.

00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:17.260
When the inspection method
by itself doesn't work,

00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:21.340
it's usually the partial
fraction expansion method

00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:25.780
that one uses, perhaps
also in conjunction

00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:28.960
with some properties of
the z transform, which

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:34.640
is something that will be going
into more in the next lecture.

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:40.340
Now finally, there is a
somewhat more formal way

00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:44.360
of evaluating the
inverse z transform.

00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:48.410
And in some cases, it's
important to actually use

00:26:48.410 --> 00:26:52.520
this to explicitly evaluate
the inverse z transform.

00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:57.110
In other cases, it's important
to make reference to the more

00:26:57.110 --> 00:27:00.920
formal inverse
transform relationship

00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:04.400
to discuss properties of
the inverse z transform.

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:08.570
So sometimes the formal
inverse transform

00:27:08.570 --> 00:27:11.270
is computationally useful.

00:27:11.270 --> 00:27:14.840
In other cases, it's
useful in proving

00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:16.970
theorems or
developing properties

00:27:16.970 --> 00:27:19.360
or something of the sort.

00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:22.990
Well this method, the
final method and the most

00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:28.360
formal method, is the
method that I refer to here

00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:32.330
as contour integration.

00:27:32.330 --> 00:27:36.170
And let me basically
hand it to you.

00:27:36.170 --> 00:27:39.830
That is, rather than go
through a derivation,

00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:44.180
let me just simply state
what the inverse z transform

00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:46.190
relationship is.

00:27:46.190 --> 00:27:50.640
In the text there is
a derivation of this.

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:54.460
And so for the purposes
of the lecture itself,

00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:56.040
let me just presented.

00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:57.580
Any objections?

00:27:57.580 --> 00:27:59.480
No.

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:06.500
So and then also work through
at least one example to show you

00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:09.199
what the mechanics are.

00:28:09.199 --> 00:28:11.240
It's another nice thing
about videotape lectures,

00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:12.734
there are never any objection.

00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:15.900
OK.

00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:17.160
Well, here it is.

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:19.020
This is the inverse z transform.

00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:19.950
What does it say?

00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:28.540
It says the sequence x of n is
1 over 2 pi j times a contour

00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:33.460
integral, which I'll return to
in a second, of x of z times

00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:37.530
z to the n minus 1 dz.

00:28:37.530 --> 00:28:40.260
If you're not used to looking
at an inverse transform

00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:42.180
relationship like
this, let me just

00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:47.700
indicate that it's
surprising how easy it

00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:50.400
is to verify that, in
fact, this is the inverse z

00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:54.180
transform relationship,
basically using the Cauchy

00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:56.270
residue theorem.

00:28:56.270 --> 00:28:58.620
But this is it.

00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:02.170
This is, of course,
a complex function.

00:29:02.170 --> 00:29:04.540
This is a complex integral.

00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:08.290
And the important
thing to straighten out

00:29:08.290 --> 00:29:11.680
is this contour c.

00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:19.210
The contours c is a closed
contour in the z plane

00:29:19.210 --> 00:29:21.970
which encircles the origin.

00:29:21.970 --> 00:29:23.700
So it's a closed contour.

00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:24.780
It encircles the origin.

00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:28.840
It's like a circle that
goes around the origin,

00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:31.180
with another very
important condition on it.

00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:35.050
Which is that it lies inside
the region of convergence

00:29:35.050 --> 00:29:36.520
of x of z.

00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:39.490
Well, that's not surprising,
because the region

00:29:39.490 --> 00:29:43.480
of convergence for x of z is the
only place where we're allowed

00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:45.670
to stick in values for z.

00:29:45.670 --> 00:29:49.980
So obviously quote,
we're not allowed

00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:54.930
to look at values of this
integrand except where x of z

00:29:54.930 --> 00:29:57.970
makes sense, that is except
in the region of convergence.

00:29:57.970 --> 00:30:01.020
So obviously then, we have
to evaluate this integral

00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:03.750
considering only values
of z inside the region

00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:06.660
of convergence.

00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:10.490
So contour c is a closed
contour in the z plane,

00:30:10.490 --> 00:30:14.060
encircles the origin, and
it lies inside the region

00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:16.360
of convergence.

00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:20.440
Now for x of z, a
rational function of z,

00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:23.610
which are the cases
we've been talking about,

00:30:23.610 --> 00:30:28.400
this entire integrand
is a rational function.

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:34.010
And consequently, a contour
integral of this type

00:30:34.010 --> 00:30:41.830
can be simply evaluated
using the notion of residues.

00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:45.380
I'll state, and hopefully
this is a property

00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:49.400
of complex contour integrals
that you're familiar with,

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:56.130
that the integral of a
rational function of that type,

00:30:56.130 --> 00:30:59.880
the integral itself is 2 pi j
times the sum of the residues

00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:02.900
inside the contour.

00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:07.640
And that 2 pi j cancels
out as 1 over 2 pi j.

00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:10.250
And consequently,
x of n is simply

00:31:10.250 --> 00:31:15.740
the sum of the residues of x
of z times z to the n minus 1

00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:19.950
at the poles inside
the contour c.

00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:21.540
The poles of what?

00:31:21.540 --> 00:31:26.610
The poles not of x and
z only, but the poles

00:31:26.610 --> 00:31:28.680
of the entire integrand.

00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:32.400
That is, x of z multiplied
by z to the n minus 1.

00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:37.100
Important point, which it's
important to keep in mind.

00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:39.950
The integral or the residues
that we're looking at

00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:43.970
are the residues, not
just of x of z, but x of z

00:31:43.970 --> 00:31:46.280
multiplied by z
to the n minus 1.

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:52.920
Another statement,
just tuck it away,

00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:58.850
is that this is valid for
both n greater than zero

00:31:58.850 --> 00:32:02.860
and equal to zero
and n less than 0.

00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:06.460
We'll see in a minute that
for n greater than zero,

00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:09.490
it might be easier to evaluate
than for n less than 0,

00:32:09.490 --> 00:32:11.290
depending on the example.

00:32:11.290 --> 00:32:14.710
But tuck away the fact
that this expression is

00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:17.590
a valid expression,
no matter whether n

00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:21.980
is positive or negative
or of course zero.

00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:22.480
All right.

00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:26.170
Let's look at the mechanics
of evaluating the inverse z

00:32:26.170 --> 00:32:28.360
transform this way.

00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:35.410
Let's return to the example x
of z equals 1 over 1 minus 1/2 z

00:32:35.410 --> 00:32:39.160
to the minus 1 with a
region of convergence

00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:42.810
the magnitude of z
greater than 1/2.

00:32:42.810 --> 00:32:46.680
And by the way,
by now if there's

00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:49.260
one thing you should have
gotten out of these lectures,

00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:51.990
it certainly should be
to be able to recognize

00:32:51.990 --> 00:32:54.540
what the inverse z
transform of this is.

00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:59.310
It's an example that I guess we
bounced around so many times.

00:32:59.310 --> 00:32:59.880
All right.

00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:05.240
Let's look at this z transform.

00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:11.280
First, let's just look
at x of z in the z plane.

00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:13.280
Here's the z plane.

00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:18.750
We have a pole at z equals 1/2.

00:33:18.750 --> 00:33:23.700
And we have a 0
at z equals zero.

00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:25.380
Here's the unit circle.

00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:27.840
And in green, what
I've indicated

00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:31.430
is the region of convergence.

00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:33.340
Now to do the
contour integration,

00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:35.710
it's not just x of z
that we're looking at.

00:33:35.710 --> 00:33:40.390
It's x of z times z to
the n minus 1 equals

00:33:40.390 --> 00:33:45.070
z to the n over z minus 1/2.

00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:49.070
Incidentally, what
is the contour

00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:54.770
of integration look like then
the z plane for this example?

00:33:54.770 --> 00:33:58.820
It's a closed contour inside
the region of convergence

00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:00.590
and encircling the origin.

00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:08.989
So for example, it's a
contour that looks like this.

00:34:08.989 --> 00:34:12.679
And incidentally,
it is and I don't

00:34:12.679 --> 00:34:18.020
think I stress this before, it's
a counter-clockwise contour.

00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:21.600
So this is the contour c.

00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:24.480
It's a counterclockwise contour.

00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:27.900
As I've drawn it, I didn't
draw a very good circle,

00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:29.730
partly because I can't.

00:34:29.730 --> 00:34:33.030
But in fact, it also
emphasizes the fact

00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:34.530
that it doesn't
have to be a circle.

00:34:34.530 --> 00:34:37.889
It just has to be closed, inside
the region of convergence,

00:34:37.889 --> 00:34:39.630
and circling the origin.

00:34:39.630 --> 00:34:43.150
And a counterclockwise contour.

00:34:43.150 --> 00:34:43.750
All right.

00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:48.940
How many poles of x of z times
z to the n minus 1 are there?

00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:50.889
That is, how many
places are there

00:34:50.889 --> 00:34:53.590
that we have to
evaluate residues?

00:34:53.590 --> 00:34:55.750
Well let's look,
first of all, at n

00:34:55.750 --> 00:34:59.550
greater than or equal to 0.

00:34:59.550 --> 00:35:02.070
This doesn't
introduce any poles.

00:35:02.070 --> 00:35:06.750
This introduces one
pole equals 1/2.

00:35:06.750 --> 00:35:11.410
So we only need to evaluate
the residue of this at this one

00:35:11.410 --> 00:35:15.270
pole that is at z equals 1/2.

00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:20.010
So we want to compute the
residue then of x of z times

00:35:20.010 --> 00:35:25.630
z to the n minus
1 at z equals 1/2.

00:35:25.630 --> 00:35:29.500
So that z to the
n over z minus 1/2

00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:35.310
multiplied by z minus 1/2
evaluated and z equals 1/2.

00:35:35.310 --> 00:35:38.690
These two cancel out.

00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:44.110
And we end up with
simply 1/2 to the n.

00:35:44.110 --> 00:35:49.420
So for n greater than or equal
to 0, the sequence x of n

00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:53.600
is just a half to the n.

00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:57.470
So that's part of
the result. Now we

00:35:57.470 --> 00:36:04.030
have to get the inverse z
transform for n less than zero.

00:36:04.030 --> 00:36:07.960
Well for n less than 0, again
of course we have 1 pole

00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:10.830
and z equal to 1/2.

00:36:10.830 --> 00:36:15.550
But now, remember that
we had this factor, which

00:36:15.550 --> 00:36:18.080
was z to the n.

00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:23.660
And for n negative that
introduces poles at the origin.

00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:27.120
And in fact it,
introduces n poles.

00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:32.600
So for n less than 0, we
have not only this pole,

00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:36.530
but we have n poles
at z equals 0.

00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:38.000
That's a problem.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.270
Because now we're going to
have to evaluate the residues

00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:44.420
and each of these poles.

00:36:44.420 --> 00:36:48.650
And the more negative value of n
we're trying to get x of n for,

00:36:48.650 --> 00:36:51.950
the worse it gets, because
the higher the multiplicity

00:36:51.950 --> 00:36:54.100
of the pole.

00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:54.600
All right.

00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:58.030
But look, we've seen
this example before.

00:36:58.030 --> 00:37:03.190
We know that x of n
is 1/2 to the n for n

00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:06.540
greater than or equal to 0
and it's 0 for n less than 0.

00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:10.000
As we knew that from other times
that we've worked this example.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.000
So obviously, there
must be some easy way

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:17.260
to get the fact that x of
n, in fact for this example,

00:37:17.260 --> 00:37:20.391
is 0 for n less than 0.

00:37:20.391 --> 00:37:20.890
All right.

00:37:20.890 --> 00:37:24.960
Let's take a look at
a way, an easy way.

00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:28.830
Here we have, again, the
inverse z transform. x of n

00:37:28.830 --> 00:37:33.330
is 1 over 2 pi j times
this contour integral.

00:37:33.330 --> 00:37:37.620
And let's simply make a
substitution of variables.

00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:40.980
Let's make the
substitution of variables z

00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:46.590
equal to p to the minus 1, in
which case z to the n minus 1

00:37:46.590 --> 00:37:51.800
is equal to p to
the minus n plus 1.

00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:57.225
Which means incidentally
that with z equal to r e

00:37:57.225 --> 00:38:03.890
to of the j theta, p, this new
variable, is 1 over r times

00:38:03.890 --> 00:38:07.170
e to the minus j theta.

00:38:07.170 --> 00:38:10.070
So now we want to make the
substitution of variables

00:38:10.070 --> 00:38:13.080
in this contour integral.

00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:18.280
Well, let's see-- dz is
minus p to the minus 2,

00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:21.120
just differentiating this.

00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:23.940
Well, I'll let you go through
the algebra on your own.

00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:27.090
But if you take this
substitution of variables,

00:38:27.090 --> 00:38:31.860
stuff it into that contour
integral, then the result

00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:38.120
that we end up with is that
x of n is equal to minus 1

00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:41.450
over 2 pi j, the minus
coming from the fact

00:38:41.450 --> 00:38:46.250
that dz is minus p to
the minus 2 times dp.

00:38:46.250 --> 00:38:48.200
That's that minus sign.

00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:53.930
x of 1 over p times p to
the minus n minus 1 dp.

00:38:53.930 --> 00:38:56.420
And what happens to the contour?

00:38:56.420 --> 00:39:02.400
Well the contour previously was,
let's say r e to the j theta.

00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:04.700
Let's take it as a
circular contour.

00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:10.190
So the contour now is 1 over
r e to the minus j theta.

00:39:10.190 --> 00:39:13.070
That means as one
consequence that

00:39:13.070 --> 00:39:14.960
our old
counter-clockwise contour

00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:17.900
turns into a clockwise contour.

00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:20.630
So that's what I've
indicated here.

00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:23.720
But we also have
this minus sign.

00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:27.470
And we can use that
minus sign to change

00:39:27.470 --> 00:39:29.490
the direction of the contour.

00:39:29.490 --> 00:39:34.610
So if we change the contour back
to a counterclockwise contour,

00:39:34.610 --> 00:39:36.860
get rid of the minus sign.

00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:39.740
Then finally we have
the expression x of n

00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:44.330
is 1 over 2 pi j times the
contour integral of capital X

00:39:44.330 --> 00:39:49.070
of 1 over p p to the
minus n minus 1 dp.

00:39:49.070 --> 00:39:51.680
And what is this contour now?

00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:57.560
Well if the old contour C was
circular with a radius of r,

00:39:57.560 --> 00:40:04.350
this contour c prime is a circle
with a radius of 1 over r.

00:40:04.350 --> 00:40:08.595
Well let's just look at what
this substitution of variable z

00:40:08.595 --> 00:40:13.280
to 1 over p did as
a matter of fact.

00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:17.450
Here I've illustrated
the z plane.

00:40:17.450 --> 00:40:21.726
Here I've illustrated
the p plane.

00:40:21.726 --> 00:40:27.150
The unit circle in the z plane,
when I replace z by 1 over p,

00:40:27.150 --> 00:40:30.840
turns again into the unit
circle in the p plane,

00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:34.610
because the unit circle is
where the magnitude of z is 1.

00:40:34.610 --> 00:40:38.760
And if I take the reciprocal of
that, the magnitude is still 1.

00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:41.970
The important thing is what
happened to this contour.

00:40:41.970 --> 00:40:46.290
Well this contour got converted
if it was outside the unit

00:40:46.290 --> 00:40:51.720
circle into a new contour which
is inside the unit circle.

00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:56.400
And in fact, in general,
stuff that was in here,

00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:58.800
the inside of the
unit circle, is

00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:03.960
going to end up outside the
unit circle in the p plane.

00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:09.750
And things that were outside
the unit circle in the z plane

00:41:09.750 --> 00:41:14.310
are going to end up inside the
unit circle in the p plane.

00:41:14.310 --> 00:41:18.270
This transformation simply takes
stuff outside the unit circle

00:41:18.270 --> 00:41:21.000
and folds it inside
the unit circle,

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.890
takes things inside
the unit circle

00:41:22.890 --> 00:41:25.080
and folds them outside
the unit circle.

00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:29.011
And it's just simply a
substitution of variables.

00:41:29.011 --> 00:41:29.510
All right.

00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:31.660
Now with this
substitution of variables,

00:41:31.660 --> 00:41:37.077
let's return to the example
that we've been working.

00:41:40.350 --> 00:41:41.365
We have our example.

00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:49.430
x of z is 1 over 1 minus
1/2 z to the minus 1,

00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:52.950
the magnitude of z
greater than 1/2.

00:41:52.950 --> 00:41:55.890
We want to replace
z by 1 over p.

00:41:55.890 --> 00:42:00.020
So we want x of 1 over p.

00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:03.590
x of 1 over p, then simply
replacing z to the minus 1

00:42:03.590 --> 00:42:09.040
by p, is 1 over 1
minus 1/2 times p.

00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:10.930
If this was true
for the magnitude

00:42:10.930 --> 00:42:14.230
of z greater than
1/2, then this is

00:42:14.230 --> 00:42:17.530
true for the magnitude
of p less than 1/2.

00:42:17.530 --> 00:42:23.090
So we get minus 2
divided by p minus 2.

00:42:23.090 --> 00:42:27.640
If we look at this
in the p plane,

00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:31.690
we have then a pole
in the p plane.

00:42:31.690 --> 00:42:34.660
The pole in the z plane
was at z equals 1/2.

00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:40.470
So the pole in the p
plane is at p equals 2.

00:42:40.470 --> 00:42:43.610
That's now outside
the unit circle.

00:42:43.610 --> 00:42:46.520
The region of convergence,
now, is inside

00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:49.220
the circle of radius 2.

00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:52.550
And where is the contour
of integration c prime?

00:42:52.550 --> 00:42:56.960
Well that now is inside
the circle of radius 2.

00:42:56.960 --> 00:43:00.440
For example, let's draw it here.

00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:04.900
So this is now the
contour c prime.

00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:06.220
All right.

00:43:06.220 --> 00:43:11.710
We want finally to evaluate
the inverse z transform,

00:43:11.710 --> 00:43:17.340
or the inverse p
transform, by looking

00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:24.091
at the residues of x of 1 over p
times p to the minus n minus 1.

00:43:24.091 --> 00:43:30.900
The residues of that at
its roots, at its poles,

00:43:30.900 --> 00:43:36.610
that are inside the contour
of integration c prime.

00:43:36.610 --> 00:43:43.770
Well, for n less than 0, we
have one pole at p equals 2.

00:43:43.770 --> 00:43:49.470
And for n negative, this
will contribute no poles.

00:43:49.470 --> 00:43:56.610
Therefore, there are no roots
of this inside this contour.

00:43:56.610 --> 00:44:01.970
And consequently, the contour
integral is obviously zero.

00:44:01.970 --> 00:44:07.090
So x of n is equal to
zero for n less than 0.

00:44:07.090 --> 00:44:11.080
Now for greater
than or equal to 0,

00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:15.500
we have one pole at p equals 2.

00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:20.240
But then because of this factor,
p to the minus n minus 1,

00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:25.680
we have n plus 1
poles at p equals 0.

00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:29.210
So now it seems like for n
greater than or equal to 0,

00:44:29.210 --> 00:44:30.710
we're back where
we started from.

00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:34.662
Because now we have these
multiple order poles at p

00:44:34.662 --> 00:44:35.980
equals 0.

00:44:35.980 --> 00:44:37.917
What do we do about that?

00:44:37.917 --> 00:44:39.750
Well, we don't have to
do anything about it.

00:44:39.750 --> 00:44:44.010
Because we already considered
the case for n greater than

00:44:44.010 --> 00:44:46.250
or equal to 0.

00:44:46.250 --> 00:44:49.550
In that case, we didn't run
into multiple order poles

00:44:49.550 --> 00:44:50.690
at the origin.

00:44:50.690 --> 00:44:52.700
We used the substitution
of variables,

00:44:52.700 --> 00:44:56.600
z equals 1 over p to
basically avoid that problem

00:44:56.600 --> 00:44:59.870
and to get the answer
for n less than 0.

00:44:59.870 --> 00:45:02.700
So consequently, the
answer that we get,

00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:07.580
which we finally know to be
the right answer in fact,

00:45:07.580 --> 00:45:12.890
is that x of n is equal
to 0 for n less than zero.

00:45:12.890 --> 00:45:17.330
And as we worked out before,
x of n is equal to 1/2

00:45:17.330 --> 00:45:21.260
to the n for n greater
than or equal to 0.

00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:33.300
Or finally, x of n is equal
to 1/2 to the n times u of n.

00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:33.800
All right.

00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:36.370
That's an example we've
worked out now three times.

00:45:36.370 --> 00:45:40.581
And three times we got the same
answer, so it must be right.

00:45:40.581 --> 00:45:41.080
All right.

00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:45.720
Well this roughs
out the inverse z

00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:49.830
transform, several methods
for getting the inverse z

00:45:49.830 --> 00:45:51.730
transform.

00:45:51.730 --> 00:45:55.900
Obviously, to become fluent
with the inverse z transform

00:45:55.900 --> 00:45:59.410
requires working
a lot of examples.

00:45:59.410 --> 00:46:02.230
And you know where
you going to have

00:46:02.230 --> 00:46:03.790
all those examples to work.

00:46:03.790 --> 00:46:06.100
That is, in the study guide.

00:46:06.100 --> 00:46:09.940
And you'll find as I
stressed previously,

00:46:09.940 --> 00:46:14.530
that as you work more and
more examples, what you find

00:46:14.530 --> 00:46:16.690
in computing
inverse z transforms

00:46:16.690 --> 00:46:19.330
is that more and
more frequently,

00:46:19.330 --> 00:46:22.970
you're able to
recognize the answer.

00:46:22.970 --> 00:46:27.920
Well, in the next lecture,
we'll complete the discussion

00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:29.630
of the z transform.

00:46:29.630 --> 00:46:32.270
In particular, we'll
among other things

00:46:32.270 --> 00:46:35.240
present some properties
of the z transform, which

00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:40.010
also by the way, help us in
computing inverse z transforms.

00:46:40.010 --> 00:46:42.620
And so in the next
lecture, we'll

00:46:42.620 --> 00:46:46.280
be continuing the topic
of the z transform,

00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:47.960
and in fact
concluding the topic.

00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:49.810
Thank you.
