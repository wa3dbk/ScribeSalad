00:00:48.636 --> 00:00:50.260
ALAN OPPENHEIM: Last
time we introduced

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.940
the notion of digital
networks and the general topic

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.470
of digital network theory.

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.550
There, of course, are
lots of directions

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.100
that that discussion
can proceed in,

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.140
but during this
set of lectures, we

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.580
won't be talking in any more
detail about the general issues

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.370
of digital network theory.

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.600
In this lecture and
the next lecture,

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.120
I would like to consider, in
particular, some of the more

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.560
common structures that
are used for implementing

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.240
digital filters--

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.030
first for the case of infinite
impulse response filters,

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.590
which we'll discuss in this
lecture, and then in the next

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:38.260
lecture some of the more common
structures for finite impulse

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.840
response digital filters.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:47.830
To begin the discussion, let's
consider the most general form,

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.070
once again, for the
transfer function

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.570
of a digital filter
where we are assuming

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.080
that the system function H of
z is a rational function in z

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.338
to the minus 1.

00:02:02.338 --> 00:02:05.950
We recall from our
previous discussions

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.000
that a rational transfer
function of this form

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.600
corresponds to a linear
constant coefficient difference

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.020
equation, and in particular,
the difference equation

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.570
corresponding to
this system function

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.440
is the difference equation
that I've indicated here.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.890
The coefficients in the
numerator corresponding

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.770
to the polynomial
that represents

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.920
the 0's of the
transfer function are

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.310
identical to the
coefficients applied

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.950
to the delayed
values of the input,

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.280
and the coefficients in the
denominator corresponding

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.910
to the coefficients for
the polynomial representing

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.690
the poles are the
same coefficients,

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.280
which, in the
difference equation,

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.740
correspond to the
weights applied

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.560
to delayed values of the output.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.880
So this is the general
form of a transfer function

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.480
for assuming that the system
is representable by a linear

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.060
constant coefficient
difference equation,

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.290
and the difference equation
corresponding to this transfer

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.160
function is as I've
indicated here.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.440
Incidentally, let me stress as
I indicated in the last lecture

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.400
that our assumption will be
throughout these discussions

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:33.910
that we are discussing--
considering a causal system.

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.090
In other words, the
region of convergence

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.120
that we would associate
with this transfer function

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.400
is the region of
convergence that would

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.390
correspond to a causal system.

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.420
In other words, the
region of convergence

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.080
is outside the outermost pole.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:55.230
There are a variety of ways in
which we can rewrite a transfer

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.480
function of this form.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.780
One possible way of writing
this transfer function

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.050
is as I've indicated
at the bottom.

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.260
That is an expression
corresponding

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.510
to the product of
two functions--

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.020
the first representing
the polynomial

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.620
for the 0's, and the
second representing

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.529
the polynomial for the poles.

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:22.860
What this suggests is
that we can imagine

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.030
implementing this system by
implementing a system which

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:32.090
realizes this transfer
function, and cascading that--

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:33.930
the cascade leading
to the product

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.550
of the system functions--

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.510
cascading that with a system
that implements this system

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.200
function.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.150
What that corresponds
to in the implementation

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.880
of the difference
equation is first

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.000
implementing in terms of
multipliers, delays, and adders

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.460
as we talked about last time--

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.790
implementing first
the linear combination

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:02.830
of the weighted
delayed input values,

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.420
and then using that as
the input to a system

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:10.600
which implements the weighted
delayed output values.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:17.370
So implementing this system
function with this function

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:22.710
first in cascade with this
corresponds to implementing

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:26.010
this difference
equation where we

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:36.840
can imagine denoting this
first sum as x1 of n--

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.870
implementing x1 of n--

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.450
implementing the
function x1 of n,

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:45.690
and then using that as the
input to a system which

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:48.720
is represented by the
difference equation y of n

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.580
equals x1 of n plus this sum.

00:05:52.580 --> 00:06:01.250
Carrying that out, the
digital network that results

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:06.000
is as I've indicated
here, where we have,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.990
first of all, the
linear combination

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:13.080
of weighted delayed
input values.

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:18.230
So here is x of n, x of n
minus 1, x of n minus 2,

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:20.600
down through x of
n minus capital

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.530
N, where I'm assuming
in drawing this

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:28.820
that capital M is
equal to capital N.

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:36.680
This first block then implements
this summation to form x1 of n,

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:42.500
and then the second system
which this has cascaded with

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.680
has as an input
x1 of n and added

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.200
to it weighted delayed
values of the output.

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.630
So here is y of
n, y of n minus 1,

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:55.250
down through y of
n minus capital N.

00:06:55.250 --> 00:07:00.200
We see the coefficients a1,
a2, through a sub capital N.

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:05.450
Clearly in this implementation
this block corresponds

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:08.270
to implementing the
zeros of the system,

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:12.080
and this block corresponds
to implementing

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:13.640
the poles of the system.

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:19.340
So as we've factored the
transfer function into the 0's

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:22.460
followed by the poles,
we have this system

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:25.910
implementing the 0's followed
by this system implementing

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:28.080
the poles.

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.680
Well, this, of course,
is one implementation

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:34.340
of the difference equation,
but in fact, there

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:38.660
are a variety of ways in which
we can manipulate the transfer

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:41.990
function, or, equivalently,
in which we can manipulate

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:46.490
the difference equation, which
will lead to other structures

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:49.490
for implementing the system
besides the structure

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:51.680
that I've indicated here.

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:56.330
Well, let's consider one simple
way of manipulating this system

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:59.510
to generate another structure.

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:04.220
We recognize this as
two systems in cascade.

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:08.150
They both implement linear
shift invariant systems,

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:10.680
and we know that two
linear shift invariant

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:15.260
systems in cascade can be
cascaded in either order

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.270
without affecting
the overall transfer

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:19.430
function of the system.

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:22.880
So we can imagine just
simply breaking the system

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:26.030
at this point,
interchanging the order

00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:28.550
in which these two
systems are cascaded,

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:30.560
and obviously what
that leads to is

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:34.470
a second implementation of
the same difference equation.

00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:36.289
That implementation
in particular,

00:08:36.289 --> 00:08:40.640
whereas this one has the zeros
first followed by the poles--

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:43.130
interchanging the
order of those two

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:46.050
will result in the
poles implemented first,

00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:48.560
followed by the
0's, and the system

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:53.660
that results is what I've
indicated on this next view

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:55.380
graph.

00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:59.030
So this system is
identical to the other one.

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:01.820
It's clearly identical in
terms of the overall transfer

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:04.460
function, and what
I've done simply

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:10.220
is just to interchange the order
in which the 0's and the poles

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:13.120
are implemented.

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:17.080
Well, that manipulation
that is breaking that system

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:20.830
and interchanging the order in
which the systems are cascaded

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:24.280
can be interpreted in terms
of either a manipulation

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:27.460
on the transfer function or a
manipulation on the difference

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:31.360
equation, and to indicate
what that corresponds

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:40.050
to let's return to the
general difference equation

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:43.320
as we had it on the
first view graph--

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:45.990
the transfer
function, where now,

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:49.920
rather than cascading this
system first and this system

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:53.220
second, we've simply
interchanged the order in which

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:55.650
those two systems are cascaded.

00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:58.140
That's interpreting
this operation in terms

00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:00.660
of the transfer function.

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:03.900
To interpret it in terms
of the difference equation

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:09.180
is slightly more involved,
but basically and very quickly

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:13.350
what it involves is first
implementing the difference

00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:18.000
equation in which we consider
that the input is just x of n

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:24.060
rather than a weighted sum of
delayed x of n's to implement

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:28.020
to implement the output y1 of n.

00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:31.350
And then since the input is,
in fact, a linear combination

00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:34.560
of weighted delayed inputs,
the corresponding output

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:38.190
is the same linear combination
of weighted delayed outputs.

00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:41.760
That essentially is derived
from using properties

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:43.890
of linear shift
invariant systems

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:47.690
that we talked about and
some of the early lectures.

00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:53.350
Well, returning to
the network that

00:10:53.350 --> 00:11:00.010
resulted by interchanging the
order of these two systems, one

00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:01.970
of the questions we
can ask, of course,

00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:05.020
is whether there
is any advantage

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:08.320
to implementing this system
rather than implementing

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:10.750
the first system
that we derived.

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:13.090
And in answering that,
one thing that we

00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:18.160
notice about this system is that
there are two parallel branches

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:23.420
here with corresponding delays.

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:25.350
Now, what does that mean?

00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:29.780
Well, if we consider this
output to be y1 of n--

00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:33.780
it's the y1 of n that we had
defined in the previous slide--

00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:37.140
the value appearing
here is y1 of n minus 1,

00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:40.396
but the value appearing
here is y1 of n minus 1.

00:11:40.396 --> 00:11:44.790
The value appearing here is y1
of n minus 2 and appearing here

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:46.740
is y1 of n minus 2.

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:51.180
And in fact, following this
chain down, what we observe

00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:55.200
is that the output of this
delay is exactly the same

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.780
as the output of this delay.

00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:01.470
Well, if that's the case,
then in fact there obviously,

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:03.660
if we think about
an implementation,

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:09.420
is no reason to separately
store this delayed output

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:12.310
and this delayed output
since they're the same.

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:16.470
In other words, we can
collapse these delays together,

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:19.110
and the network
that results when

00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:25.440
we do that is the network that
I indicate here, where all

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:29.010
that I've done in going from
the previous network to this one

00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:32.520
is simply collapse
the delays together,

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:35.040
taking advantage of the
fact that their outputs

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:37.240
were identical.

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:39.990
Now, in drawing a
network, of course,

00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:44.760
it doesn't particularly
matter whether we conserve

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:47.520
z to the minus 1's or
equivalently whether we

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:51.000
collapse a network when we
can take advantage of the fact

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.090
that the output of two
delays is the same,

00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:56.550
but clearly in terms
of implementation

00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:59.940
of a digital filter either
in terms of a program

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:02.670
or in terms of special
purpose hardware,

00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:08.400
obviously clearly there's
an advantage to reducing

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:12.090
the number of delay registers
that are required, because you

00:13:12.090 --> 00:13:15.600
see each z to the
minus 1 that appears

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:19.900
in the structure requires
in the implementation

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:23.590
a register to store the value--

00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:27.080
in other words, to hold
it for the next iteration.

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:31.240
So in this structure, as
it's implemented here,

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:35.500
we have n delay
registers, where again I'm

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:40.120
assuming that capital M was
equal to capital N. There are

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:43.570
N delay registers, whereas
in the first network

00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:45.310
that we generated--

00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:49.030
the network corresponding to the
0's first and then the poles--

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:52.150
the there were two
M delay registers.

00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:59.100
In general, a digital
filter structure

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:01.614
that has the minimum
number of delay

00:14:01.614 --> 00:14:03.780
registers-- and you can
show that the minimum number

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:07.050
required is the
greater of M or N,

00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:10.080
or since we're
considering M equal to N,

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:14.010
the minimum number
is N. The structure

00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:16.350
that has only that
minimum number

00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:18.720
and no more is
generally referred

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:21.220
to as a canonic structure.

00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:24.610
So the structure that
I've indicated here

00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:26.490
is a canonic structure.

00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:30.960
It has the minimum
number of delays,

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:33.720
but in fact, it's not the
only canonic structure.

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:37.890
There are a large variety
of canonic structures,

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:40.740
and in fact, there's
a canonic structure

00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:43.620
that is similar to
the first structure

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:48.150
that we derived in the
sense that it also has--

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:52.950
is implemented with the 0's
first, followed by the poles.

00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:56.490
Let me remind you again that
this system as it's implemented

00:14:56.490 --> 00:15:00.120
is basically a cascade
of the system poles.

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:03.600
Those are the a's--

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:06.270
or the polynomial
that this implements

00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:08.100
corresponds to the poles--

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:12.390
followed by an implementation of
the 0's, and it's the b's that

00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:14.490
control the 0's.

00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:17.700
Well, to generate
another canonic structure

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:21.540
we can take advantage
of a theorem

00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:25.290
that, in fact, is a very
powerful theorem in dealing

00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:26.860
with filter structures--

00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:28.980
the theorem, which
is referred to

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:32.400
as the transposition theorem.

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:35.730
What the transposition
theorem says

00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:42.570
is that, if we have a network
that implements a transfer

00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:48.140
function, and if we simply
reverse the direction of all

00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:53.690
of the branches in the
network and we interchange

00:15:53.690 --> 00:15:58.080
the input and the
output, then the transfer

00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:02.660
function that results
is exactly the same.

00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:06.280
So it says take the network,
reverse the direction

00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:09.640
of the branches, put the
input where the output was,

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:12.640
take the output
where the input was,

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:16.930
and what you find is that the
transfer function of the system

00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:19.380
is exactly the same.

00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:21.750
Well, let me illustrate
this theorem.

00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:24.180
We won't incidentally
prove the theorem,

00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:29.100
although in the notes in the
text at the end of the chapter

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:33.510
there, in fact, is a proof
of the transposition theorem,

00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:36.400
but let me illustrate the
transposition theorem--

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:39.060
first with a simple
example that makes it

00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:41.850
appear to be a trivial
theorem, and then

00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:45.060
with another example
that suggests

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:48.360
that perhaps the theorem is less
obvious than it would at first

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:50.320
appear.

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:52.900
Well, to illustrate the
transposition theorem,

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:55.810
let's begin with
a simple network--

00:16:55.810 --> 00:16:58.670
just a simple first
order network,

00:16:58.670 --> 00:17:03.160
two coefficient branches
and a delay branch.

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:09.310
The transposition theorem
says that we want first of all

00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:14.990
to reverse the direction
of all of the branches.

00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:17.200
So this branch gets
turned around, again,

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:19.300
with a gain of unity.

00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:22.390
This branch gets turned
around with a gain of c.

00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:25.595
This branch gets turned
around with a gain of a.

00:17:25.595 --> 00:17:29.140
The delay branch
is turned around.

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:33.970
This branch, which has a gain
of unity, is turned around.

00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:38.620
Put the input where the output
was, and take the output

00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:41.310
from where the input was.

00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:46.950
So the transpose of this
network is the network

00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:51.980
that I've indicated here,
and now of course we

00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:55.070
can redraw this
network by putting

00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:59.900
the input on the left hand
side and taking the output

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:00.980
on the right hand side.

00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:03.110
That is taking the
same network and just

00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:06.020
flipping it over-- flipping
it over because we tend

00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:08.120
to have a convention that
the input is coming in

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:12.320
from the left and the output
is going out at the right.

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:14.990
If we do that, just
taking this network

00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:17.840
and simply flipping
it over, we have

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:21.860
x of n coming in
through a unity gain.

00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:25.380
This delay has now ended
up on the left hand side,

00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:27.890
and you can verify in
a straightforward way

00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:30.500
that these branches are
now correct if we just take

00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:32.810
this network and flip it over.

00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:37.670
And is it true that the transfer
function of this network

00:18:37.670 --> 00:18:42.160
is identical to the transfer
function of this network?

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:44.530
Well, you should be able
to see by inspection

00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:46.400
that in fact it is true.

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:49.360
In fact, if you compare
this network to this one,

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:50.750
what's the only difference?

00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:54.850
The only difference is that this
delay, instead of being here,

00:18:54.850 --> 00:18:58.810
ended up on the other side of
the coefficient multiplier.

00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:02.320
And obviously since
these two in cascade

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:04.610
implement a times
z to the minus 1,

00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:07.900
it doesn't matter whether
I do the multiplication

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:11.170
by a first and then
delay or the reverse.

00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:18.320
So applying the transposition
theorem to this simple example,

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:20.950
we see that obviously
for this example

00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:23.320
the transposition theorem works.

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:30.730
Well, let's try it on a slightly
more complicated example

00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:34.960
not to verify that it works,
but just again to emphasize

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:38.380
how the transposition
is implemented.

00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:45.260
Here I have an example in which
I have a canonic first order

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:46.310
system.

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:50.200
This implements
one 0 and one pole.

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:52.420
Here is the
implementation of the pole

00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:55.220
and the implementation of the 0.

00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:58.250
This, in fact, is the
first order counterpart

00:19:58.250 --> 00:20:03.350
of the canonic structure that I
showed several view graphs ago.

00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:07.070
And so it's one pole,
and that's implemented

00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:09.350
through this loop,
one 0, and that's

00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:12.130
implemented through this loop.

00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:14.440
And these, of course,
are unity gain

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:17.210
since I put no
amplitude on them.

00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:19.600
And now to apply the
transposition theorem

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:24.420
to this network, again, we
interchange the-- we reverse

00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:27.130
the direction of
all of the arrows,

00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:31.250
and you can see that I've done
that in all of these branches.

00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:33.590
The delay is likewise reversed.

00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:38.460
The a is reversed,
and the b is reversed.

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:41.600
I put the input in
where the output was.

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:45.020
I take the output out
where the input was,

00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:47.420
and then the
transposition theorem

00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:51.890
says that this first
order system implements

00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:55.280
exactly the same transfer
function as this first order

00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:57.530
system does.

00:20:57.530 --> 00:21:03.020
Well, again, we can redraw
this by taking again the input

00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:04.880
at the left hand
side, the output

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:08.270
at the right hand side that
corresponds to just taking

00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:10.015
this and flipping it over.

00:21:10.015 --> 00:21:12.380
In fact, I could do that
by taking the view graph

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:16.460
and just flipping it
over, and the result then,

00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:20.360
just flipping this
over, is the system

00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:22.700
that I've indicated here--

00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:25.520
x of n in at the left
hand side, y of n

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:27.360
out at the right hand side.

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:30.260
And now in comparing
these two there

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:32.510
are some changes
that took place.

00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:35.120
In particular, we notice
that the direction

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:40.290
of the delayed
branch is reversed.

00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:44.840
Furthermore, whereas this system
implemented the pole first

00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:50.420
followed by the 0, this
system implements the 0 first,

00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:52.540
followed by the pole.

00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:54.310
Is this still a
canonic structure?

00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:56.200
Well, of course it's
a canonic structure

00:21:56.200 --> 00:22:01.390
because it only has one
delay, and obviously, in fact,

00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:04.360
transposing a network
couldn't possibly

00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:07.250
affect the number of
delays in the network

00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:09.610
so that, if we begin
with a canonic structure

00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:12.010
and apply the transposition
theorem to it,

00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:15.670
we must end up with a
canonic structure also.

00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:17.470
Well, it shouldn't be obvious--

00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:21.100
or, at least it isn't
obvious to me by inspection--

00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:25.450
that this system and this
system have the same transfer

00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:27.850
function, but in
fact you can verify

00:22:27.850 --> 00:22:31.150
that in a very simple
and straightforward way

00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:34.450
by simply calculating what the
transfer functions of these two

00:22:34.450 --> 00:22:36.640
systems are.

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:43.240
Well, returning then to the
general canonic structure

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:50.840
that we had, we can generate
a second canonic structure

00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:56.720
by applying the transposition
theorem to this structure.

00:22:56.720 --> 00:23:00.680
That is reversing the
directions of all of the arrows,

00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:04.310
putting the input in here, and
taking the output out there,

00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:07.610
and then to keep our convention
of the input in at the left,

00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:09.440
the output out at
the right, flip

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:14.270
that over to generate a second
canonic structure, which

00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:16.980
is the transpose
of this structure.

00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:22.430
And if we do that, the
two changes to focus on

00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:26.060
is that the direction of the
delayed branches is reversed,

00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:30.780
and furthermore, the system
will implement the 0's first,

00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:32.420
followed by the poles.

00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:36.860
In fact, the
network that results

00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:42.390
is what I've indicated here.

00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:47.790
This is then the transposed
version of the structure

00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:53.070
that I just showed on
the last view graph.

00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:55.110
The 0's are implemented here.

00:23:55.110 --> 00:23:57.810
The poles are implemented
here, and the direction

00:23:57.810 --> 00:24:00.090
of the delayed
branches is reversed,

00:24:00.090 --> 00:24:04.890
but again, this is a
canonic form structure.

00:24:04.890 --> 00:24:09.240
So some structures are
canonic form, and some aren't.

00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:11.160
The first one, in
fact, that we developed

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:14.760
wasn't canonic form in the
sense that it had more delays

00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:17.160
than were absolutely necessary.

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:19.560
The last two structures
that we've shown

00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:22.500
are canonic form structures
in that they have

00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:24.660
the minimum number of delays.

00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:27.750
All of these
structures are referred

00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:31.800
to as direct form structures--

00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:36.120
direct form because
they are structures

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:40.800
that involve as
coefficients in them

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:45.300
the same coefficients that
are present in the difference

00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:48.160
equation describing
the overall system.

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:51.960
Recall again that these were the
coefficients in the difference

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:55.830
equation which were applied
to the delayed values

00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:58.680
of the input, and these were the
coefficients in the difference

00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:03.090
equation that were applied to
delayed values of the output.

00:25:03.090 --> 00:25:06.930
And this structure and
the other structures

00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:09.450
involving the
coefficients in that form

00:25:09.450 --> 00:25:15.320
are often referred to as
direct form structures.

00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:19.130
Well, these structures are fine
for implementing the difference

00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:23.060
equation, although there
are other structures--

00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:25.430
actually there are essentially
an infinite variety

00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:29.000
of structures, but there are
some other structures that

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:35.660
in some situations are better
to use than the direct form

00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:38.360
structures, and two
of the more common,

00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:42.890
which I'd like to introduce
now, are the cascade structure

00:25:42.890 --> 00:25:47.600
and the parallel structure.

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:53.360
The cascade structure
is developed basically

00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:57.800
by factoring the transfer
function of the system

00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:01.040
into a product of second
order sections or second order

00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:02.150
factors.

00:26:02.150 --> 00:26:05.750
In particular, we have,
again, the general form

00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:07.520
of the transfer function--

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:11.680
H of z as the numerator
polynomial for the 0's,

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:15.830
a denominator polynomial
for the poles.

00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:18.460
We can factor the
numerator polynomial

00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:22.330
into a product of first order
polynomials and the denominator

00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:26.560
polynomial into a product
of first order polynomials.

00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:30.160
In general, of course, these
factors will be complex,

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:33.250
and these factors
will be complex.

00:26:33.250 --> 00:26:38.020
We can combine together the
complex conjugate 0 pairs

00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:40.510
and the complex
conjugate pole pairs

00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:44.200
so that in fact as a
general cascade form

00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:48.700
it's often convenient to think
of a factorization of each

00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:52.570
of these polynomials into
second order polynomials rather

00:26:52.570 --> 00:26:55.420
than first order polynomials.

00:26:55.420 --> 00:26:59.260
Carrying that out, we end
up with a representation

00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:05.110
of the transfer function in a
form as I've indicated here--

00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:08.950
a second order numerator
polynomial and a second order

00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:11.860
denominator polynomial,
and, of course,

00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:14.590
it's the product
of these that we

00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:17.140
use to implement
this overall transfer

00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:20.380
function with some
constant multiplier

00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:24.610
out in front, which is required
essentially because we've

00:27:24.610 --> 00:27:27.580
normalized these polynomials
to have a leading

00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:30.610
coefficient of unity.

00:27:30.610 --> 00:27:36.070
Well, first of all, why
might we want to do this?

00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:40.270
There actually are a variety
of reasons for perhaps wanting

00:27:40.270 --> 00:27:43.390
to consider an implementation
of the transfer function

00:27:43.390 --> 00:27:47.080
in terms of a cascade
of lower order

00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:51.040
systems than the general
n-th order system.

00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:53.170
One of the more
common reasons, which

00:27:53.170 --> 00:27:55.940
I'll have more to
say about actually

00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:58.270
at the end of the
next lecture, but I'd

00:27:58.270 --> 00:28:00.510
like to at least
allude to it now,

00:28:00.510 --> 00:28:05.110
is the fact that any time
we implement a system

00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:09.310
on a digital computer or with
special purpose hardware we're

00:28:09.310 --> 00:28:14.020
faced with the problem that
these coefficients can't

00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:16.420
be represented exactly.

00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:19.870
If we have, let's say, an
18 bit fixed point register,

00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:23.260
we're restricted to
truncating or rounding

00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:26.110
these coefficients to 18 bits.

00:28:26.110 --> 00:28:29.500
If we implement a filter and
special purpose hardware,

00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:31.780
we might want the
coefficient registers

00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:35.380
to be as low as 4, or
5, or 6, or 10 bits.

00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:39.010
Obviously, the more
bits, the more expensive

00:28:39.010 --> 00:28:42.010
the hardware implementation is.

00:28:42.010 --> 00:28:46.030
And the statement which
I'll make and justify

00:28:46.030 --> 00:28:49.360
in a little more detail at
the end of the next lecture

00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:54.460
is that, if I implement
the poles of the system

00:28:54.460 --> 00:29:00.670
through a high order polynomial,
errors in the coefficients

00:29:00.670 --> 00:29:04.240
lead to large errors in
the pole locations as

00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:08.530
compared with an implementation
of the poles in terms

00:29:08.530 --> 00:29:10.420
of low order polynomials.

00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:12.430
That is, basically
the sensitivity

00:29:12.430 --> 00:29:16.840
of pole locations to
errors in the coefficients

00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:20.710
is higher the higher the
order of the polynomial.

00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:25.120
Consequently, if that indeed
is an issue for the filter

00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:29.470
implementation,
then it is better

00:29:29.470 --> 00:29:34.000
to implement a system as
a cascade of lower order

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.580
systems or lower
order polynomials

00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:41.080
then as one large
high order polynomial.

00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:44.410
So factoring this
transfer function

00:29:44.410 --> 00:29:50.230
into a cascade of second order
sections, what this leads

00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:54.970
to is an implementation
of the system as a cascade

00:29:54.970 --> 00:29:58.960
of second order
systems, and we, again,

00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:01.780
have the choice of
implementing each second order

00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:05.830
section in a variety
of ways corresponding

00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:10.660
to the various direct forms that
we've talked about previously.

00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:18.280
One implementation, which
is a canonic direct form,

00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:21.760
is the implementation
that I indicate here,

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:28.030
where this is alpha 1,1,
the coefficient alpha 1,1,

00:30:28.030 --> 00:30:30.040
the coefficient beta 1,1.

00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:32.860
It's a little hard to see where
each of these coefficients

00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:38.350
goes, but this is a canonic
form implementation of a second

00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:41.620
order section that has
two poles and two 0's.

00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:46.180
So as I've implemented it, I've
implemented it with the poles

00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:50.380
first, followed by
the 0's, and then this

00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:55.570
is one second order piece that's
in cascade with the next pole 0

00:30:55.570 --> 00:30:59.740
pair, with the next
pole 0 pair, et cetera.

00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:03.970
So this is a cascade of
second order sections,

00:31:03.970 --> 00:31:08.980
and, of course, I can generate
other cascade forms was

00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:12.490
one possibility by just simply
applying the transposition

00:31:12.490 --> 00:31:17.830
theorem to this cascade, and
basically what would result

00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:20.710
is that each of
these delay branches

00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:23.980
would be reversed in
direction, and the 0's

00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:27.280
would be implemented first,
followed by the poles.

00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:29.930
Generally what's meant though
by the cascade structure,

00:31:29.930 --> 00:31:33.460
and you can see again that
there are a variety of cascade

00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:35.260
structures depending
on how you choose

00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:37.840
to implement the pole 0 pairs--

00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:40.120
what is generally meant
by the cascade structure

00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:44.410
or a cascade structure is an
implementation of the transfer

00:31:44.410 --> 00:31:48.910
function is a cascade
of second order sections

00:31:48.910 --> 00:31:51.130
where the second order
sections can be implemented

00:31:51.130 --> 00:31:54.470
in a variety of ways.

00:31:54.470 --> 00:32:02.130
Another structure which is like
the cascade structure in that

00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:06.250
it implements the poles in
terms of low order sections,

00:32:06.250 --> 00:32:08.880
but is different in
the way effectively

00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:13.470
that it realizes the zeros is
the so-called parallel form

00:32:13.470 --> 00:32:15.840
structure.

00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:22.404
And the parallel form structure
can be implemented by--

00:32:22.404 --> 00:32:28.170
can be derived by
expanding the transfer

00:32:28.170 --> 00:32:31.800
function of the system in
terms of a partial fraction

00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:33.960
expansion.

00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:39.960
That is, we can expand this
transfer function in terms of--

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:42.750
and let's assume first
of all the capital

00:32:42.750 --> 00:32:45.570
M is less than capital
N. If capital M were less

00:32:45.570 --> 00:32:48.930
than capital N, we
can expand this simply

00:32:48.930 --> 00:32:55.920
as a sum of residues together
with first order poles,

00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:59.350
or in general since
the poles are complex,

00:32:59.350 --> 00:33:04.620
we can imagine factoring this
in terms of first order terms

00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:09.740
corresponding to the real
poles, and then second order

00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:13.220
terms where we combine together
first order terms which

00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:16.550
are complex conjugates so
that we have second order

00:33:16.550 --> 00:33:19.450
terms of this form.

00:33:19.450 --> 00:33:22.290
If capital M is
less than capital N,

00:33:22.290 --> 00:33:24.600
those are the only
two kinds of terms

00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:28.290
that would result in a
partial fraction expansion.

00:33:28.290 --> 00:33:32.510
If capital M is greater
than or equal to capital N,

00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:36.660
then we'll have additional
terms corresponding simply

00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:40.932
to weighted powers
of z to the minus 1.

00:33:40.932 --> 00:33:45.900
Now, as in the cascade form,
generally the parallel form

00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:48.450
structure is
considered to be one

00:33:48.450 --> 00:33:53.310
where even if we
have real poles we

00:33:53.310 --> 00:33:55.830
combine two of the
real poles together

00:33:55.830 --> 00:33:59.250
to implement the system in
terms of second order sections.

00:33:59.250 --> 00:34:03.690
If we do that, then the parallel
form expansion for the transfer

00:34:03.690 --> 00:34:07.240
function is what
I've indicated here,

00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:10.080
where combining two terms
of this form together,

00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:15.670
or, equivalently, looking
at expansions of this form,

00:34:15.670 --> 00:34:20.940
we have a numerator polynomial
implementing a single 0

00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:25.290
and a denominator polynomial
implementing two poles.

00:34:25.290 --> 00:34:28.500
And then depending on whether
M is greater than capital N

00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:30.659
or not, there might
be additional terms

00:34:30.659 --> 00:34:36.030
involving simple weighted
values of z to the minus--

00:34:36.030 --> 00:34:39.300
weighted powers of
z to the minus 1.

00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:43.620
Let me stress that there are
some differences between this

00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:45.960
and the cascade form obviously.

00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:48.900
One of the differences
is that the sections used

00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:53.159
for implementing the
filter consist of one 0

00:34:53.159 --> 00:34:58.770
plus two poles,
and then the output

00:34:58.770 --> 00:35:02.490
is formed not as a cascade
of sections of that type,

00:35:02.490 --> 00:35:07.885
but as a sum of the outputs of
sections of that type since H

00:35:07.885 --> 00:35:12.420
of z here is expressed as a
sum of second order sections,

00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:14.130
whereas in the
cascade form it is

00:35:14.130 --> 00:35:18.270
expressed as a product
of second order sections.

00:35:18.270 --> 00:35:23.990
Well, the general filter
structure that results I've

00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:26.540
indicated here for
the case in which we

00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:29.640
have three second
order sections,

00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:33.890
and again, I'm assuming that
capital M is equal to capital N

00:35:33.890 --> 00:35:37.250
so that we have one branch,
which is just simply

00:35:37.250 --> 00:35:38.900
a coefficient branch.

00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:41.990
If capital M was one
more than capital N,

00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:45.570
we would have in addition
to that one delay branch.

00:35:45.570 --> 00:35:49.580
And then we have
second order sections

00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:52.160
as I've indicated here,
but the second order

00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:57.590
sections implement only a
single 0 and a pair of poles--

00:35:57.590 --> 00:36:01.980
a single 0 and a pair of poles.

00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:06.060
Now, why might you want
to use a parallel form

00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:11.730
implementation instead of a
cascade form implementation?

00:36:11.730 --> 00:36:14.410
Well, there actually
are several reasons.

00:36:14.410 --> 00:36:17.520
One of the most common,
in fact, though,

00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:22.950
is that sometimes in applying
filter design techniques

00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:29.040
the filter design
parameters are automatically

00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:31.260
generated in a parallel form.

00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:34.110
That is, rather
than being generated

00:36:34.110 --> 00:36:38.010
either as a ratio of polynomials
or as poles and 0's, it

00:36:38.010 --> 00:36:41.640
might be generated in terms
of residues and poles.

00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:44.400
In that case, of course,
it's very straightforward

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:48.090
to go to a parallel form
implementation rather than

00:36:48.090 --> 00:36:50.790
a cascade form implementation.

00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:53.550
Basically the difference
between the two forms

00:36:53.550 --> 00:36:57.390
is that the cascade
form implements

00:36:57.390 --> 00:37:02.640
in terms of low order sections
poles and 0's of the system,

00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:08.340
whereas the parallel form
implementation is effectively

00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:12.192
an implementation of the
system in terms of the poles.

00:37:12.192 --> 00:37:14.400
The poles are controlled in
the same way as they were

00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:18.960
in the cascade structure, but
poles and residues rather than

00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:21.690
poles and 0's.

00:37:21.690 --> 00:37:23.730
Again, with the
parallel form structure,

00:37:23.730 --> 00:37:26.190
we can generate other
parallel form structures

00:37:26.190 --> 00:37:29.850
by considering other ways of
implementing the second order

00:37:29.850 --> 00:37:30.510
sections.

00:37:30.510 --> 00:37:34.200
One possibility is to apply
the transposition theorem,

00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:36.930
and in fact, there are other
implementations of second order

00:37:36.930 --> 00:37:41.430
sections, and so we can
talk about a variety

00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:44.610
of parallel form structures,
but generally when

00:37:44.610 --> 00:37:48.840
we refer to a parallel form or
the parallel form structures,

00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:51.360
we generally mean a
parallel realization

00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:54.390
of poles in terms of
second order sections

00:37:54.390 --> 00:37:57.060
and a weighting applied that
correspond to the residues.

00:37:59.590 --> 00:38:04.420
Now, the topic of
digital filter structures

00:38:04.420 --> 00:38:08.320
is, in fact, a very
complicated topic.

00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:11.710
There are a lot of
other filter structures

00:38:11.710 --> 00:38:15.670
which can be used for
implementing recursive filters,

00:38:15.670 --> 00:38:19.540
or non-recursive filters, or
a finite impulse response,

00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:21.910
or infinite impulse response.

00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:25.180
There are structures referred
to as continued fraction

00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:25.870
structures.

00:38:25.870 --> 00:38:29.320
There are structures referred
to as interpolation structures.

00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:31.930
There are structures referred
to as lattice structures,

00:38:31.930 --> 00:38:34.360
and ladder
structures, et cetera.

00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:38.060
There are a large variety
of structures, and in fact,

00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:43.120
one of the very important
issues currently is the design

00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:45.580
and development of
structures and the comparison

00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:50.260
of structures in particular
focusing on the trade-offs--

00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:52.300
that is, the advantages
and disadvantages--

00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:54.720
between various structures.

00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:56.860
The structures that
I've introduced here--

00:38:56.860 --> 00:39:00.160
that is, the direct form,
the canonic form, cascade,

00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:01.540
and parallel--

00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:06.100
are the most common
structures which are used.

00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:08.500
They, in fact, tend
to hold up very well

00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:13.270
and seem to be for
a variety of reasons

00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:16.600
some of the more
advantageous structures.

00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:22.240
While I've presented this
discussion from a general point

00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:27.100
of view and tended to focus
on infinite impulse response

00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:30.790
transfer functions,
obviously these structures

00:39:30.790 --> 00:39:35.620
can be applied to finite impulse
response or infinite impulse

00:39:35.620 --> 00:39:37.600
response systems.

00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:40.180
In the next lecture,
I'd like to continue

00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:45.550
the discussion of structures
by focusing specifically

00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:48.370
on finite impulse
response systems

00:39:48.370 --> 00:39:54.400
and directing our attention to
some specific structures that

00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:57.040
apply only to find
an impulse response

00:39:57.040 --> 00:40:00.460
and take advantage of
some particular aspects

00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:02.640
of finite impulse
response systems.

00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:04.390
Thank you.
