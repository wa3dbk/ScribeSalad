00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.430
The last lecture we consider
some basic structures

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.760
for infinite impulse
response and actually also

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.660
for finite impulse
response systems.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.170
In this lecture, I would
like to focus specifically

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.930
on finite impulse response
systems and indicate, to show,

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.380
that for that class
of systems, there

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.980
are some structures
that specifically

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.370
exploit properties of
FIR, or finite impulse

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.990
response, systems.

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.090
First of all, let's
consider the general form

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.170
of a finite impulse
response system.

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.720
One of the characteristics of a
finite impulse response system,

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.520
of course, is the fact that
the impulse response has

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.850
only a finite number
of nonzero samples,

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.460
or equivalently the system
function involves a sum only

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:49.900
over a finite range.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.290
So the system function in
general for a finite impulse

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.410
response system is of this form.

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.440
And the difference
equation for this system

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.880
is that the form of a sum from
k will 0 to capital N minus 1

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:10.550
of h of k, the unit sample
response, x of n minus k.

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.190
We've stressed the
fact, of course,

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.010
in a variety of the
earlier lectures,

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.490
that the difference equation
for a finite impulse response

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.150
system, in fact, corresponds
to the convolution

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.170
sum for finite impulse
response systems,

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.470
or the coefficients in
the difference equation

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.690
are, in fact, the values of
the unit sample response.

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.090
Now, for a finite
impulse response system

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.260
we can, of course, talk about
the same types of structures

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.200
that we talked about
in a previous lecture.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.090
For example, we can generate
a direct form structure

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.150
from the difference
equation, or equivalently

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.300
from the z transform.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.620
And we see that the direct
form structure corresponds

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:05.470
to generating a weighted
combination of delayed inputs

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.860
where the weighting coefficients
are the values in the unit

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.270
sample response h of n.

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.130
So for a general
direct form structure,

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:20.980
we have x of n, x of n minus 1
at the output of this delay, x

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:27.130
of n minus 2, et cetera, x of
n minus 1 multiplied by h of 1,

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.990
x of n multiplied by h of
0, down through the chain.

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:34.660
The results added
up at the output

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.770
to produce the
overall output y of n.

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:42.190
So this is what would
correspond to applying

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.860
the notion of a
direct form structure

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.290
to a finite impulse
response system.

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.490
Likewise, we could talk
about a transposed form

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:52.840
of this network.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.040
We could also talk about
a cascade form realization

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.480
of a finite impulse
response filter,

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.380
simply by factoring
this into a product,

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.060
not a poles and zeros,
because, of course,

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.440
there aren't poles for a
finite impulse response system,

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.110
but as a cascade
of zeros, either

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.100
implemented as first or
second order sections.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.620
Something to give some
thought to incidentally

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.610
is whether for a finite
impulse response system

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:24.790
you can generate a
parallel form structure

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:28.960
like the parallel form structure
that we talked about last time.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.540
The answer to that,
in fact, is no.

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.460
And it's tied to
the fact that an FIR

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.650
system doesn't have any poles.

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.750
Although as we'll see
later on in this lecture,

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:44.170
there is a structure that is
of the form of a parallel form

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:47.380
for implementing FIR systems.

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.810
So the first point
then is that we

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:53.650
can apply many of the ideas
of the previous lecture

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.290
to FIR systems.

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:01.060
But in addition, there are some
properties of some FIR systems

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:05.350
that lead to some specific
network structures that

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.710
in general can't be used
for implementing IIR,

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.960
or recursive, systems.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.040
The first of these that
I'd like to talk about

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:19.960
is directed specifically
toward the implementation

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.300
of linear phase FIR systems.

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.510
Now recall from
several lectures ago--

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:31.795
and we've again raised this
point a number of times--

00:05:31.795 --> 00:05:37.450
that one of the differences
between IIR and FIR systems

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:42.130
is that because of the fact that
the impulse response of an FIR

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:46.830
system is a finite
length, those systems

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:50.730
can in fact be designed to
have exactly linear phase,

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:53.400
whereas the corresponding
statement of course

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.850
is not true for the case of
infinite impulse response

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:59.510
systems.

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:04.760
In particular, a linear phase
finite impulse response system

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:09.480
is one for which the values
in the unit sample response

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:13.550
satisfy a certain symmetry
condition, namely the symmetry

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:16.490
condition as I've
indicated it here,

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:22.250
h of n equal to h of capital
N minus 1 minus little n,

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:26.720
where capital N is the length
of the finite length impulse

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.520
response.

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:34.310
For example, a finite, a linear
phase FIR impulse response

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:38.670
as one example might look,
as I've indicated here,

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:42.980
where I've drawn it for
capital N equal to 9.

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:48.590
And this symmetry
property says that h of 0,

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:52.370
if I substitute n equals 0,
is equal to h of capital N

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:55.370
minus 1, or h of 8.

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:58.700
And we can see that that's
the symmetry that we have.

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:02.390
And then likewise, the
linear phase property

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:06.230
says that as I go through
the impulse response

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:09.110
from both ends, I
see identical values

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:11.570
so that these values
are identical.

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:13.080
Then these values are identical.

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:14.900
Then these values are identical.

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:19.700
These, and, of course, this
one is identical to itself.

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:26.480
And that then is the general
symmetry of a linear phase FIR

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:27.260
impulse response.

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:35.810
Well, in fact, to stress once
again that the phase is indeed

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:41.180
linear, we can consider
generating a unit sample

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:45.800
response or impulse response
h1 of n, which corresponds

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:49.280
to this unit sample
response shifted

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:55.740
so that it's centered around
the origin, in which case h of n

00:07:55.740 --> 00:08:00.570
is equal to h1 of n
plus capital N minus 1.

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:09.060
Or in this case, h of n is h1
of n shifted to the right by 4.

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:14.130
And consequently, the
frequency response

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:18.330
for this system, or the Fourier
transform of the unit sample

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:22.620
response is the Fourier
transform of the unit sample

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:27.400
response of this system
multiplied by e to the j omega

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:30.270
capital N minus 1 over 2.

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:34.200
That is just due to the fact
that these two unit sample

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:38.500
responses are related to
each other by a linear shift.

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:41.850
Now, this unit sample
response is even.

00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:44.670
That is it's even
about n equals 0.

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:47.940
And consequently,
its Fourier transform

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:51.810
is a real function of omega.

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:54.390
So this is real.

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:57.180
And consequently,
the phase associated

00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:02.760
with the causal system h of n
is just simply this linear phase

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:06.420
term, e to the j omega
N minus 1 over 2.

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:10.020
So this is an
argument, again, that

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:13.470
stresses the fact that
if the unit sample

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:17.580
response has this symmetry,
then the phase of the system

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:19.470
is linear.

00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:22.440
Now, how can we exploit
this in the implementation

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:27.070
of finite impulse
response systems?

00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:31.950
Well, let's look, first of
all, at the general expression

00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:34.260
for the z transform
of the system,

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:40.280
h of z given by a sum of
h of n z to the minus n.

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:44.460
And essentially the idea
in exploiting this symmetry

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:49.020
for the implementation
of FIR systems

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:54.630
is to take advantage of the
fact that because roughly half

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:58.540
of the values in h
of n are identical,

00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:03.100
we should be able to implement
the system with essentially

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:05.350
only half the
number of multiplies

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:10.360
that would be required in
a more general FIR system.

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:13.270
Well, to show how
this works, let's

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:16.030
work through this
for the case where

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:18.460
we assume that
capital N, the number

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:24.130
of non-zero points in the
unit sample response, is even.

00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:27.430
In the previous example, we'd
considered capital N odd.

00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:29.110
Here, in working
through this let's

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:30.710
assume that capital N is even.

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:33.100
And a similar
derivation would apply

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:37.920
and has gone through in
the text for capital N odd.

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:43.400
OK, well, we can express
the transfer function h of z

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:48.130
as a sum from n equals 0
to capital N over 2 minus 1

00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:51.500
of h of n z to the minus n--

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:57.050
those are the first half points,
the first half of the non-zero

00:10:57.050 --> 00:10:58.280
points--

00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:01.010
plus the sum over
the second half

00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:04.670
of the non-zero points from
capital N over 2 to capital

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:06.350
N minus 1.

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:08.750
And basically where
we want to get to

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:14.030
is to exploit the fact that
these points are numerically

00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:17.420
equal to these, except
that the index runs

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:19.400
in the other direction.

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:24.620
Well to develop that formally,
let's manipulate this sum

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:28.280
by using a substitution
of variables.

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:31.790
In particular, let's make
the substitution of variables

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:37.190
that r is equal to capital
N minus 1 minus little n,

00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:45.240
or equivalently that little n
is equal to capital N minus 1

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:47.520
minus r.

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:50.820
If we do that,
then changing this

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:56.220
to a summation on r, where
we have that little n

00:11:56.220 --> 00:12:00.300
is equal to capital N over 2,
little n equal to capital N

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:05.070
over 2, r is equal to
capital N over 2 minus 1,

00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:07.840
as I've indicated here.

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:10.380
And when little n is equal
to capital N minus 1,

00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:14.520
little r is equal to 0.

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:19.000
So this gets converted
to a sum from r equals 0

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.450
to capital N over 2 minus 1.

00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:26.040
h of what was n, which
is now capital N minus 1

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:28.770
minus r substituted in here.

00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:33.210
And then capital N minus 1
minus r again substituted

00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:35.370
for little n.

00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:38.120
Basically, what we've
done is reduce this

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:41.700
to a sum over the same
limits as we have here

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:45.900
and with the indices running
in the opposite direction.

00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:50.730
And now, we can recognize
that because of the symmetry

00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:52.770
property, because of
the fact that we're

00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:56.970
talking about a linear
phase system, h of capital

00:12:56.970 --> 00:13:05.530
N minus 1 minus r
is equal to h of r.

00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:08.020
That's the symmetry
property that

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:13.100
corresponds to stating that
the system is linear phase.

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:16.170
All right, well, so here
we have a sum from n

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:18.160
equals 0 to N over 2 minus 1.

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:20.480
Some things involving h of n.

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:24.560
Here we have a sum from r
equals 0 to N over 2 minus 1,

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:27.870
some things involving h of r.

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:29.900
This index of
summation, of course,

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:31.590
is just a dummy variable.

00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:35.570
And we can change it back to
n if we want to, which we do.

00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:40.340
So rewriting these two sum,
in particular rewriting

00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:44.540
this one in terms now
of a summation on n,

00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:47.810
this becomes the
sum from n equals 0

00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:52.790
to capital N over 2 minus 1, h
of n z to the minus capital N

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:55.480
minus 1 minus little n.

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:59.090
This sum, of course,
stays the same.

00:13:59.090 --> 00:14:02.420
And now, because we
have h of n appearing

00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:06.320
in both of these sums, we
can combine this together

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:13.730
into a single summation, from 0
to N over 2 minus 1 of h of n,

00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:17.260
the values in the
unit sample response,

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:21.190
times z to the minus n
plus z to the minus capital

00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:24.880
N minus 1 minus little n.

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:31.140
Notice now that we only
have in this summation

00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:33.810
half the terms that
we had originally.

00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:36.190
In other words,
there are capital N

00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:39.630
over 2 different
coefficients that we're

00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:44.220
using, whereas in the
direct form implementation,

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:46.710
there were capital N
coefficients that we

00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:47.610
were using.

00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:52.530
And here, we're exploiting the
symmetry in the coefficients.

00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:54.620
Well, let's see
what this implies

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:57.610
in terms of a filter structure.

00:14:57.610 --> 00:15:00.870
Here, I've simply
rewritten, again,

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:05.420
the general form for the
transfer function assuming

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:09.230
that the system is linear phase,
as we've just previously worked

00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:09.860
out.

00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:14.720
This is just simply a rewrite
of the previous expression.

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:17.030
And let's look at
this, for example,

00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:21.230
I had assumed that that
capital N was even.

00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:23.770
So let's choose as
an example capital

00:15:23.770 --> 00:15:29.600
N equal to 8, in which case this
expression becomes a sum from n

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:36.710
equals 0 to 3, h of n, z to the
minus n plus z to the minus--

00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:40.160
capital N minus 1 is
7, so minus 7 minus n.

00:15:43.050 --> 00:15:47.550
Well, how many delays are
involved in implementing

00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:50.220
this system function?

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:56.700
Apparently, there are seven
delays involved whether or not

00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:58.290
the system is linear phase.

00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:01.230
And that shouldn't be
surprising because the length

00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:04.700
of the impulse
response is still 8.

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:08.120
So seven delays in
general are required,

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:12.770
but only four
coefficients are required.

00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:15.980
And to see what structure
is implied by this,

00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:21.140
we recognize that h
of z is constructed

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:26.900
by summing a system which
corresponds to a delay.

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:31.650
Looking at this expression
for n equal 0, no delay.

00:16:31.650 --> 00:16:36.440
n equal 0 substituted in gives
us a transfer function of 1.

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:41.015
Plus a delay with n equal
0 substituted in of 7.

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:48.110
The output of those two delays
added together and multiplied

00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:55.310
by h of 0, and consequently, if
we consider a chain of delays

00:16:55.310 --> 00:16:59.780
as I've drawn here,
we have the output

00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:04.550
before we go through
any delays added

00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:09.550
to the output from
the seventh delay--

00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:13.339
that's looking at this
expression for n equal 0--

00:17:13.339 --> 00:17:23.770
and the result of that
summation multiplied by h of 0

00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:27.630
to form the first
term in this sum.

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:31.180
To form the next term in
the sum for n equals 1,

00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:36.000
we have the output of
one delay plus the output

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.640
from the 7th minus 1th delay.

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:40.680
That is the 6th delay.

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:45.970
So we have this output, the
output from the first delay,

00:17:45.970 --> 00:17:48.870
and this output, the
output from the 6th delay.

00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:59.620
And now that is multiplied
by h of 1 coefficient, which

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:04.810
is h of 1, to form the
next term in the sum.

00:18:04.810 --> 00:18:09.310
And if we go through the
remaining terms in the sum,

00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:12.010
we have the output from the
2nd delay and the output

00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:16.520
from the 5th delay
added together.

00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:20.940
That multiplied by h of 2.

00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:26.120
The output from the 3rd
delay and the output

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:30.990
from the 4th delay
added together

00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:34.440
and that multiplied by h of 3.

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:37.690
That forms the individual
terms in this sum.

00:18:37.690 --> 00:18:41.260
And now we want finally
to add those together.

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:45.480
So we can simply
add those together

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:55.670
at their outputs to
form the output y of n.

00:18:55.670 --> 00:19:00.070
So here is a structure
which implements

00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:05.650
a finite impulse response system
of order 8, or of length 8.

00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:08.080
It involves seven
delays, which of course

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:10.270
the direct form also involves.

00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:12.520
But the important
aspect of it is

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:16.600
that it involves only half
the number of multiplies

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:20.500
that the direct form
would normally require.

00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:23.320
Taking advantage of the fact
that it's a linear phase system

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:26.500
then, we're able to
implement the system

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:28.160
with half the
number of multiplies

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:31.370
than would be
required in general.

00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:33.550
All right, so this
is one structure.

00:19:33.550 --> 00:19:37.750
I stress again that it's not the
only structure for implementing

00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:39.490
a linear phase system.

00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:43.570
Clearly, we can generate
another structure, linear phase

00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:47.380
structure, by simply applying
the transposition theorem

00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:48.370
to this structure.

00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:51.550
And we would end up with a
transposed configuration.

00:19:51.550 --> 00:19:53.900
And an example of that
is shown in the text.

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:55.520
I won't bother going through it.

00:19:55.520 --> 00:20:00.490
But the important aspect here is
that we were able to exploit--

00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:03.200
in the case a finite
impulse response systems

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:07.120
we're able to exploit the
linear phase characteristics

00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:09.880
of the system, if we're
talking about a system that

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:10.630
is linear phase.

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:20.840
The second structure that is
peculiar to find an impulse

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:26.660
response systems and in some
instances has some advantages

00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:31.130
is a structure that is often
referred to as a frequency

00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:32.870
sampling structure.

00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:35.870
The reason for that being
that the coefficients

00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:40.490
in the structure correspond
to samples of the frequency

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:42.140
response of the system.

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:43.580
And I'll indicate
in a few minutes

00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:46.340
why that might be an advantage.

00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:50.000
But first let's look at
what the specific structure

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.690
is that's involved.

00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:55.900
A frequency sampling
structure is

00:20:55.900 --> 00:21:02.700
derived by essentially
implementing the system,

00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:05.940
or inquiry as to what the
implementation would be,

00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:09.870
if we specify the system in
terms, rather than of the unit

00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:15.510
sample response, of the discrete
Fourier transform coefficients.

00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:20.910
We recall, and I hope that this
is second nature to you by now,

00:21:20.910 --> 00:21:24.130
in general we have a
unit sample response.

00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:26.380
This is a finite
impulse response system.

00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:28.650
So this is a finite
length sequence.

00:21:28.650 --> 00:21:32.730
So we can describe it in
terms of it's discrete Fourier

00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:34.020
transform.

00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:36.420
And the discrete Fourier
transform coefficients

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:39.390
are referred to as h of k.

00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:42.780
Or we can describe
it as we can describe

00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:46.560
almost all sequences in
terms of its z transform,

00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:50.890
or a system in terms
of its system function.

00:21:50.890 --> 00:21:54.030
The z transform is the
sum of h of n times

00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:56.590
e to the minus, n
as it always is.

00:21:56.590 --> 00:22:02.530
And the unit sample
response can be

00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:05.740
expressed in terms of
the discrete Fourier

00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:10.000
transform coefficients
in terms of the sum of H

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.510
of k W sub N to the minus n k.

00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:16.640
We have the 1/N out in front.

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:21.400
And again, this term
R sub capital N then

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:26.170
to just simply truncate h
of n after capital N points.

00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:30.250
That is to extract one period
from the periodic function

00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:32.470
that this sum generates.

00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:37.770
Now, we can substitute
h of n expressed

00:22:37.770 --> 00:22:44.850
in terms of its discrete Fourier
transform into this expression.

00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:48.000
The R sub N of n will
disappear because we're only

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.730
summing from n equal 0
to capital N minus 1.

00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:56.040
And if we substitute
this in here

00:22:56.040 --> 00:23:00.570
and interchange the order in
which we evaluate the sums,

00:23:00.570 --> 00:23:02.940
then the resulting
expression for the z

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:05.760
transform for the
system function

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:12.510
is the sum from K equal 0 to
N minus 1 of the DFT values.

00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:18.750
And this term and this term
are involved in the sum on n.

00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:22.950
And they result in the sum from
0 to capital N minus 1 of z

00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:27.210
to the minus 1, W
capital N to the minus k.

00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:29.910
That raised to the n-th power.

00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:32.370
Well, this is the
kind of summation

00:23:32.370 --> 00:23:35.160
that we've been carrying out
again and again, particularly

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:38.400
in talking about finite
length sequences.

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:42.870
And hopefully, this is
another kind of summation

00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:46.050
that by now you carry
around in your hip pocket.

00:23:46.050 --> 00:23:49.035
It's the sum from 0
to capital N minus 1

00:23:49.035 --> 00:23:51.150
of something of the
form alpha to the n,

00:23:51.150 --> 00:23:53.730
where the alpha
happens to be that.

00:23:53.730 --> 00:24:01.996
And that sums up to 1 minus z
to the minus capital N times--

00:24:01.996 --> 00:24:06.320
let's see, 1 minus z
to the minus capital N

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:13.490
and actually W sub capital
N to the minus k capital N.

00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:16.720
That is it sums up
to this alpha raised

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:22.190
to the capital N-th power
divided by 1 minus W sub N

00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:25.980
to the minus k times
z to the minus 1.

00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:31.340
Well, what does W sub capital
N to any integer multiple

00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:32.870
of capital N?

00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:35.180
That's just simply
equal to unity.

00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:37.320
So this term disappears.

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:39.030
And we end up simply
with 1 minus z

00:24:39.030 --> 00:24:42.770
to the minus n divided by this.

00:24:42.770 --> 00:24:46.970
All right, so combining
this together,

00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:54.710
we can then express h of z as 1
minus z to the minus capital N,

00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:58.490
we have this 1/N, which we
have to account for somehow,

00:24:58.490 --> 00:25:02.930
and then finally a sum from
0 to N minus 1 of H of k,

00:25:02.930 --> 00:25:05.095
divided by this factor.

00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:13.400
And so this is an expression for
the z transform of the system,

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:16.010
or the transfer function
of the system, where

00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:18.530
the coefficients
in that expression

00:25:18.530 --> 00:25:23.210
are the discrete Fourier
transform values H of k.

00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:25.140
The discrete Fourier
transform values,

00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:28.060
as we've stressed
several times, in fact

00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:34.640
are samples on the unit
circle of the z transform.

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:39.110
So these coefficients,
the H of k's are

00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:42.050
in effect samples
of the frequency

00:25:42.050 --> 00:25:43.530
response of the system.

00:25:43.530 --> 00:25:46.610
In other words, they
are frequency samples.

00:25:46.610 --> 00:25:49.910
And consequently, the
structure that this implies

00:25:49.910 --> 00:25:55.330
is usually referred to as a
frequency sampling structure.

00:25:55.330 --> 00:25:59.950
Well, let's look at what
the specific structure is.

00:25:59.950 --> 00:26:04.060
We can view this as a cascade
of the system that implements

00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:08.200
this term in cascade
with the system that

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:11.620
implements this summation.

00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:15.730
This term is simply
implemented by a gain

00:26:15.730 --> 00:26:20.660
of unity in the
forward direction,

00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:25.130
and then a gain of minus
z to the minus capital N--

00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:28.035
I happen to have the arrow here
in the reverse direction, which

00:26:28.035 --> 00:26:28.535
is wrong.

00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:34.530
This is as an arrow, again,
in the forward direction.

00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:37.590
That just simply implements
the system, 1 minus z

00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:40.876
to the minus capital N.

00:26:40.876 --> 00:26:44.430
And that I guess makes
enough of a mess out of it,

00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:47.940
so that hopefully you
can at least see what

00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:49.770
direction that arrow goes in.

00:26:49.770 --> 00:26:53.070
This then implements that piece.

00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:56.220
To implement this
sum, well, this sum

00:26:56.220 --> 00:27:00.550
implies a parallel
combination of systems,

00:27:00.550 --> 00:27:03.960
each system implementing
one of these pieces.

00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:07.320
So if we look at this,
say, for k equal 0,

00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:12.764
we have a coefficient of 0 as
I've indicated here and a pole.

00:27:12.764 --> 00:27:13.680
And where is the pole?

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:19.290
Well, the pole for k equal 0
is at W sub N to the minus 0.

00:27:19.290 --> 00:27:22.440
For k equal to 1, it's
at W sub N to the minus 1

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:24.090
and on through.

00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:28.110
So the system that
implements this sum is then

00:27:28.110 --> 00:27:32.670
a parallel combination
of first order poles,

00:27:32.670 --> 00:27:35.730
where the coefficient
in the feedback path

00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:38.800
is W sub N to the minus k.

00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:42.390
And the gain in
the forward path,

00:27:42.390 --> 00:27:45.510
which can be placed either
before or after the pole,

00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:48.990
are the frequency
samples H of 0, H of 1,

00:27:48.990 --> 00:27:52.369
down through H of n minus 1.

00:27:52.369 --> 00:27:53.910
And then, of course,
we have the gain

00:27:53.910 --> 00:27:57.150
of 1/N, which has
to go someplace.

00:27:57.150 --> 00:28:02.090
And for now, let's just
leave it at the end.

00:28:02.090 --> 00:28:05.090
I stress also that
these, of course,

00:28:05.090 --> 00:28:11.870
are complex poles, because
W sub N to an integer power

00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:13.670
is in general complex.

00:28:13.670 --> 00:28:15.590
We can, of course,
redraw this structure

00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:19.550
by combining complex
conjugate poles together.

00:28:19.550 --> 00:28:24.570
And the structure that results
is indicated in the text.

00:28:24.570 --> 00:28:26.720
I won't bother to do that here.

00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:30.110
But there are a couple of points
about this structure that I'd

00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:33.960
like to draw your attention to.

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:37.710
First of all, we started with a
finite impulse response system.

00:28:40.330 --> 00:28:44.140
Obviously, we've ended up with a
finite impulse response system.

00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:49.150
But the system appears
to have some poles in it.

00:28:49.150 --> 00:28:51.460
That is its a
recursive structure,

00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:55.150
and it has in fact
capital N poles

00:28:55.150 --> 00:28:58.630
involved in the implementation,
although presumably

00:28:58.630 --> 00:29:03.140
the overall system
function has only zeros.

00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:06.290
Well, how can that be?

00:29:06.290 --> 00:29:11.100
Very simply because if
you look at this term,

00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:16.330
this term has capital N
zeros equally distributed

00:29:16.330 --> 00:29:19.870
around the unit circle in angle.

00:29:19.870 --> 00:29:23.980
And in fact, a zero
is occurring exactly

00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:27.310
at the location where
each of these poles occur.

00:29:27.310 --> 00:29:32.890
So that, in fact, this
piece in cascade with this

00:29:32.890 --> 00:29:37.870
cancels out this feedback
loop, or this pole simply

00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:42.130
cancels out one of the
zeros from this term.

00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:45.220
This one cancels out
another zero and on down

00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:46.630
through the chain.

00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:50.680
So in the overall system
function, there are no poles.

00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:52.330
There are only zeros.

00:29:52.330 --> 00:29:55.930
And what happens in
effect is that these poles

00:29:55.930 --> 00:29:58.870
are used to cancel out
different zeros appearing

00:29:58.870 --> 00:30:00.790
in this first path.

00:30:00.790 --> 00:30:02.650
That suggests one
of the problems,

00:30:02.650 --> 00:30:05.440
in fact, with the frequency
sampling structure

00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:11.500
because it requires poles, as
I've drawn it here actually

00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:13.570
on the unit circle--

00:30:13.570 --> 00:30:15.860
in an actual
implementation obviously

00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:18.250
that would be slightly
of the unit circle--

00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:21.400
but it involves
implementing poles

00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:25.530
to cancel out the zeros
appearing in this term 1 minus

00:30:25.530 --> 00:30:27.400
z to the minus n.

00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:32.540
And that has some drawbacks
from a number of points of view.

00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:34.720
In fact, it has some drawbacks--

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:36.640
we won't analyze
this, but it turns out

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:39.970
to be true that due
to finite register

00:30:39.970 --> 00:30:42.670
length effects there
are some drawbacks.

00:30:42.670 --> 00:30:45.400
But there are also
some advantages

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:47.870
to this kind of structure.

00:30:47.870 --> 00:30:51.370
And the advantages
in some situations

00:30:51.370 --> 00:30:54.580
outweigh the disadvantage,
the main disadvantage,

00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:58.870
of canceling out zeros with
poles or poles with zeroes.

00:30:58.870 --> 00:31:01.660
One of the first advantages
is that the coefficients

00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:06.770
that are involved involve
frequency samples.

00:31:06.770 --> 00:31:12.130
Now, in many situations what
we would like to implement

00:31:12.130 --> 00:31:16.360
is a system in which perhaps a
large number of the frequency

00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:19.180
samples happen to be zero.

00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:21.010
Imagine for example,
implementing

00:31:21.010 --> 00:31:25.420
a very narrow band, low
pass or bandpass, filter

00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:28.270
and specifying the
filter in such a way

00:31:28.270 --> 00:31:32.260
that the frequency samples
in-band are non-zero

00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:36.340
and the frequency samples out
of band are equal to zero.

00:31:36.340 --> 00:31:39.280
In that case, most
of the coefficients

00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:42.280
are coefficients which
are zero coefficients.

00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:45.580
And consequently, there will
be only a few of these paths

00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:49.540
that we have to implement,
so that in that situation

00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:54.130
where perhaps a large number
of frequency samples are zero--

00:31:54.130 --> 00:31:57.640
in fact, the number of
multiplications involved

00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:01.180
in implementing the system, and
in fact, the number of delays

00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:03.550
involved in
implementing the system,

00:32:03.550 --> 00:32:07.270
might be significantly reduced.

00:32:07.270 --> 00:32:11.290
Another advantage to a
frequency sampling structure

00:32:11.290 --> 00:32:17.590
is the fact that it is basically
a parallel form structure.

00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:22.330
And that can be exploited
in terms of implementation

00:32:22.330 --> 00:32:26.830
of a large number of filters, or
in terms of the implementation

00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:28.510
of a filter bank.

00:32:28.510 --> 00:32:33.410
Let me state more specifically
what I mean by that.

00:32:33.410 --> 00:32:38.980
In this system function,
this piece and this piece,

00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:43.150
except for the H of k's,
are tied only to the fact

00:32:43.150 --> 00:32:45.430
that the unit sample
response of the system

00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:50.120
is of length capital N.
So that if I implement

00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:54.960
a large number of systems whose
impulse response is of length

00:32:54.960 --> 00:33:00.410
capital N, the systems will
look identical from the input

00:33:00.410 --> 00:33:04.970
up to the point where I do the
multiplication by the frequency

00:33:04.970 --> 00:33:06.740
samples.

00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:09.800
Consequently, if I were to
implement a large number of

00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:12.230
filters simultaneously.

00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:16.640
I can use in common for
all of those systems

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:19.550
the part of this
structure from the input

00:33:19.550 --> 00:33:23.510
to the output of the poles.

00:33:23.510 --> 00:33:26.390
And then simply draw
off those outputs,

00:33:26.390 --> 00:33:30.320
multiply by the required
frequency samples,

00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:33.860
sum the outputs, and that
implements the filter.

00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:37.100
Consequently, I'm able
to share among all

00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:39.770
of the filters in
the filter bank

00:33:39.770 --> 00:33:45.590
these delays, these delays, and
the multiplications by powers

00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:49.640
of W. And the only
additional coefficients

00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:53.000
and the only additional
pieces that come in that

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.580
differ between the filters
and the filter bank

00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:59.620
are the coefficients that I
multiply these outputs by.

00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:01.520
I need to multiply
by the coefficients

00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:04.070
and then form the
linear combination.

00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:10.010
So that then are the two
primary advantages to frequency

00:34:10.010 --> 00:34:11.630
sampling structures.

00:34:11.630 --> 00:34:14.000
And in fact, frequency
sampling structures

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.010
have found application
primarily for those two reasons.

00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:27.000
Well, there are lots
of other structures

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.750
that one can talk about,
both for a finite impulse

00:34:30.750 --> 00:34:34.330
response an infinite
impulse response systems.

00:34:34.330 --> 00:34:37.380
And as I stressed at the
end of the last lecture,

00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:40.230
the discussion of
structures in general

00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:45.989
and the kinds of structures that
can be generated is very vast.

00:34:45.989 --> 00:34:51.179
In fact, it seems that new
structures are generated faster

00:34:51.179 --> 00:34:53.610
than they can be evaluated.

00:34:53.610 --> 00:34:57.480
And I would like to
terminate the discussion

00:34:57.480 --> 00:35:01.470
of specific structures with just
the ones that I've shown you

00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:04.800
in the previous
lecture and the ones

00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:07.050
that I've shown for finite
impulse response systems

00:35:07.050 --> 00:35:09.440
in this lecture.

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:13.280
To conclude that discussion
of digital networks

00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:15.950
and digital filter
structures, I'd

00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:19.310
like to focus
finally on just a few

00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:22.490
of the issues, one
primarily, involved

00:35:22.490 --> 00:35:25.940
in the comparison of
filter structures.

00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:28.790
Now we've talked about
different structures.

00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:31.250
One of the things
that obviously is true

00:35:31.250 --> 00:35:34.400
is that from a strictly
mathematical point of view,

00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:37.520
all of these structures,
different ways of implementing

00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:40.340
the same transfer
function, obviously

00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:42.980
implement the same
transfer function.

00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:46.670
That is algebraically
or theoretically,

00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:51.110
all of the structures from
an input output point of view

00:35:51.110 --> 00:35:52.670
are indistinguishable.

00:35:52.670 --> 00:35:56.820
In other words, they generate
the same transfer function.

00:35:56.820 --> 00:35:58.610
On the other hand,
there are a variety

00:35:58.610 --> 00:36:02.060
of issues when one considers
the practical implementation

00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:08.900
of digital filters that have
to be considered in choosing

00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:11.330
different filter structures.

00:36:11.330 --> 00:36:15.620
One of them I suggested last
time to be the number of delays

00:36:15.620 --> 00:36:16.160
involved.

00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:19.970
And we saw the difference
between non-canonic and canonic

00:36:19.970 --> 00:36:22.460
form structures.

00:36:22.460 --> 00:36:23.960
Delays mean registers.

00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:26.450
And registers mean hardware.

00:36:26.450 --> 00:36:28.400
In talking about
linear phase filters,

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:32.420
we saw that if we exploit the
linear phase property, then

00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:34.670
we can reduce the number
of multiplications

00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:36.860
involved by half.

00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:42.140
And multiplications, again, mean
hardware or speed or something

00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:45.840
of that sort in terms
of the implementation.

00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:47.870
Another common
characteristic that

00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:50.900
can be focused on in
comparing structures

00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:54.350
is what you could
refer to as modularity.

00:36:54.350 --> 00:36:57.050
It's particularly important
in hardware implementation

00:36:57.050 --> 00:36:59.780
of digital filters,
where perhaps you

00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:04.370
would like your structure
to have stages in it that

00:37:04.370 --> 00:37:08.570
are identical, so that
the implications in terms

00:37:08.570 --> 00:37:11.930
of the hardware are that
a section or sections can

00:37:11.930 --> 00:37:16.910
be multiplexed and therefore
used over and over again.

00:37:16.910 --> 00:37:20.510
And another issue,
which is the one

00:37:20.510 --> 00:37:23.450
that I'd like to direct
our attention to finally

00:37:23.450 --> 00:37:27.140
are the effect of
finite register

00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:31.640
length on the characteristics
of the system.

00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:35.110
And these characteristics,
or the finite register length

00:37:35.110 --> 00:37:39.260
effects, in fact, are very
heavily dependent on the filter

00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:41.720
structures that are used.

00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:44.780
There are two kinds of finite
register length effects.

00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:47.330
One of them has to
do with the fact

00:37:47.330 --> 00:37:52.220
that arithmetic in
a digital filter,

00:37:52.220 --> 00:37:55.610
specifically in a
recursive digital filter,

00:37:55.610 --> 00:37:58.880
has to be done, of course,
with finite register length,

00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:00.980
and it has to be truncated.

00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:05.540
In other words, multiplications,
the result of B bits times B

00:38:05.540 --> 00:38:07.730
bits results in 2B bits.

00:38:07.730 --> 00:38:11.060
If this goes on indefinitely,
obviously the register length

00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:12.710
grows indefinitely.

00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:18.680
And so the results
of arithmetic have

00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:20.630
to be truncated or rounded.

00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:24.230
And this generates some
noise or essentially

00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:27.230
noise in the filter output.

00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:31.700
And the second thing is
the fact that coefficients

00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:35.480
have to be represented in
finite register length.

00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:37.760
That is coefficients
or parameters

00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:39.410
have to be truncated.

00:38:39.410 --> 00:38:42.230
What I would like to do
in closing the lecture

00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:45.410
is just briefly
give you a glimpse

00:38:45.410 --> 00:38:49.730
into some of the issues of
the coefficient, or parameter,

00:38:49.730 --> 00:38:55.640
quantization and not delve
any in any more detail

00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:59.870
into the relatively complex
issue of finite register length

00:38:59.870 --> 00:39:01.130
effects.

00:39:01.130 --> 00:39:05.540
But let's focus just a
little bit, just a little,

00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:10.720
on the effects of
parameter quantization.

00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:14.650
In particular, we have, of
course, the general form

00:39:14.650 --> 00:39:18.850
for a system function as a
ratio of polynomials in z

00:39:18.850 --> 00:39:23.500
to the minus 1, where the
denominator polynomial,

00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:25.630
as we've been writing
it, is of the form

00:39:25.630 --> 00:39:31.820
1 minus the sum of a sub
k times z to the minus k.

00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:36.260
Well, let's imagine that
what we would like to do

00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:42.830
or that it's reasonable to tie
the investigation of H of z

00:39:42.830 --> 00:39:48.620
in terms of parameter errors
to the accuracy, with which

00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:52.800
the poles of the transfer
function can be placed.

00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:57.740
We can express this polynomial,
the denominator polynomial,

00:39:57.740 --> 00:40:01.260
in factored form, where, of
course, each of the factors

00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:06.000
involves the poles of
the system explicitly.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:10.210
And now as we talk about
implementing this system,

00:40:10.210 --> 00:40:14.220
the coefficients in the
denominator polynomial,

00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:17.370
and in the numerator
polynomial also,

00:40:17.370 --> 00:40:21.420
have errors due to the fact
that they have to be represented

00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:23.980
in a finite register length.

00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:29.920
So we can represent that as the
coefficient that we actually

00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:32.800
arrive at is the
coefficient that we really

00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:35.800
want plus some error.

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:38.800
And consequently,
the pole location,

00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:41.920
the location of each of
the poles, the i-th pole,

00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:48.880
for example, is where we
want it plus some deviation.

00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:51.750
Now, we can examine
what this deviation

00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:58.080
is by essentially assuming
that the variation

00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:01.590
in these parameters is small.

00:41:01.590 --> 00:41:05.070
And expressing
this error in terms

00:41:05.070 --> 00:41:10.470
of the partial derivatives of
the pole locations expressed

00:41:10.470 --> 00:41:13.320
in terms of the
coefficients a sub k.

00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:17.340
In other words, we can
express the movement

00:41:17.340 --> 00:41:23.220
of the pole in terms of the
movement of the coefficients

00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:26.730
as a sum of the
partial derivative

00:41:26.730 --> 00:41:30.262
of the pole, the
i-th pole-- that's

00:41:30.262 --> 00:41:32.220
the one we're talking
about here-- with respect

00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:35.070
to the k-th coefficient
times the error

00:41:35.070 --> 00:41:37.810
in the k-th coefficient.

00:41:37.810 --> 00:41:39.540
Well, this can be
tracked through--

00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:40.950
and this is done in the text.

00:41:40.950 --> 00:41:42.750
I won't go through the algebra--

00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:47.790
but basically, the result is
that this partial derivative

00:41:47.790 --> 00:41:51.450
can be expressed in this form
where the important thing

00:41:51.450 --> 00:41:55.680
to focus on is that what's
involved in the denominator

00:41:55.680 --> 00:42:01.390
is the product of the difference
in the pole locations.

00:42:01.390 --> 00:42:04.530
Let's assume, for example,
that all of the poles

00:42:04.530 --> 00:42:09.450
are clustered inside a
circle of radius epsilon.

00:42:09.450 --> 00:42:12.600
In other words, the largest
distance between the poles

00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:14.780
is epsilon.

00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:20.010
What that says then is that
when we substitute that

00:42:20.010 --> 00:42:23.760
in for this expression,
the absolute value

00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:28.380
of the change in the pole
location with respect

00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:34.110
to a change in the coefficient
has in the denominator epsilon

00:42:34.110 --> 00:42:36.220
raised to the n-th power.

00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:38.000
Well, what does that mean?

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:43.280
What it means is that if
the poles are clustered

00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:48.000
within a radius within a
circle of radius epsilon,

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:53.260
for any given pole the higher
the order of the polynomial

00:42:53.260 --> 00:42:55.680
that we use to
implement the pole,

00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:59.400
the greater the sensitivity of
the pole location with respect

00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:00.990
to the coefficient.

00:43:00.990 --> 00:43:05.790
So this says that
if we implement

00:43:05.790 --> 00:43:07.980
the poles of the system,
or when we implement

00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:10.530
the poles of the
system, it obviously

00:43:10.530 --> 00:43:15.630
is better to implement the
poles through a lower order

00:43:15.630 --> 00:43:19.591
polynomial rather than through
a higher order polynomial.

00:43:19.591 --> 00:43:21.340
What does this mean
in terms of the filter

00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:23.410
structures we've
been talking about?

00:43:23.410 --> 00:43:26.920
It means basically that the
direct form structures are

00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:32.500
the most sensitive, that the
cascade form structures are

00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:36.370
certainly less sensitive than
the direct form structure,

00:43:36.370 --> 00:43:38.950
and the parallel form
structure in terms

00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:41.260
of the implementation
of the poles

00:43:41.260 --> 00:43:43.360
have the same type
of hypersensitivity

00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:45.850
as the cascade form
and likewise are less

00:43:45.850 --> 00:43:49.450
sensitive than the direct form.

00:43:49.450 --> 00:43:53.180
Even in the cascade
form structure,

00:43:53.180 --> 00:43:55.300
though, there's
some flexibility.

00:43:55.300 --> 00:43:59.650
And there are some
issues with regard to how

00:43:59.650 --> 00:44:01.330
the poles are implemented.

00:44:01.330 --> 00:44:05.470
And let me close the
lecture by just giving you

00:44:05.470 --> 00:44:09.310
some indication of what some
of the-- in particular what two

00:44:09.310 --> 00:44:11.067
of the possibilities might be.

00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:22.380
Based on the discussion that
we've just gone through,

00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:26.520
the indication is that we
would want to implement,

00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:29.130
or it might be it advantageous
from the point of view

00:44:29.130 --> 00:44:35.010
of parameter quantization, to
implement a system as a cascade

00:44:35.010 --> 00:44:38.940
or parallel combination of
first or second order sections.

00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:41.760
And let's make them
second order sections.

00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:45.540
Let's look once again
at the implementation

00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:49.090
of a simple second
order pole pair.

00:44:49.090 --> 00:44:52.140
I've neglected the
implementation of the zeros.

00:44:52.140 --> 00:44:54.630
But clearly the point
that I'm about to make

00:44:54.630 --> 00:44:57.270
extends also for
the implementation

00:44:57.270 --> 00:44:59.970
of two poles and two zeros.

00:44:59.970 --> 00:45:03.270
Here, I have
implemented in what we

00:45:03.270 --> 00:45:07.680
had referred to as direct form,
a second order section which

00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:11.220
we might use in a cascade
form or parallel form

00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:16.140
realization, which
implements the complex pole

00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:22.790
pair at radius r, an angle
plus, and minus theta.

00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:26.980
In the actual implementation
of a cascade or parallel form

00:45:26.980 --> 00:45:30.730
structure using a second
order section of this form,

00:45:30.730 --> 00:45:33.730
it is these
coefficients that are

00:45:33.730 --> 00:45:39.140
quantized to fit within
a finite register length.

00:45:39.140 --> 00:45:41.060
We see then that
the quantization

00:45:41.060 --> 00:45:45.080
of the coefficients for
this particular network form

00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:48.800
corresponds to quantizing
the parameter r squared

00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:53.850
and quantizing the
parameter 2r cosine theta.

00:45:53.850 --> 00:46:00.640
What this implies in the
z-plane is that for, let's say,

00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:03.720
a choice of register length
for this particular case

00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:09.920
equal to 3, for 3-bit
register length, the pole

00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:14.140
locations which can be
implemented with that system

00:46:14.140 --> 00:46:18.700
are restricted to fall at the
intersection of the grid points

00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:22.000
that I've indicated
here due to the fact

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:26.050
that quantization of the
parameter r cosine theta

00:46:26.050 --> 00:46:31.900
implies that we must lie
along lines equally spaced

00:46:31.900 --> 00:46:33.980
along the horizontal axis.

00:46:33.980 --> 00:46:37.630
Recall that r cosine theta is
just the real part of the pole

00:46:37.630 --> 00:46:39.190
location.

00:46:39.190 --> 00:46:41.100
And quantization
of the parameter r

00:46:41.100 --> 00:46:45.310
squared corresponds
to the requirement

00:46:45.310 --> 00:46:48.880
that the poles must
lie along circles,

00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:53.260
which are spaced according to
the quantization of r square.

00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:57.760
So the realizable pole positions
with a second order section

00:46:57.760 --> 00:47:02.890
in the form that I indicated
on the previous slide

00:47:02.890 --> 00:47:06.880
are given by the constellation,
or by the intersection

00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:11.150
of the grid points,
that we have shown here.

00:47:11.150 --> 00:47:17.810
Another possible implementation
for a second order pole pair

00:47:17.810 --> 00:47:22.040
is the so-called coupled
form implementation.

00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:25.760
I won't justify
here by inspection

00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:30.560
that the transfer function is
given by the same expression as

00:47:30.560 --> 00:47:34.190
for the direct form structure
that I showed previously,

00:47:34.190 --> 00:47:35.970
but, in fact, it is.

00:47:35.970 --> 00:47:38.970
And the poles in
this case fall at,

00:47:38.970 --> 00:47:42.290
again, are equal to e
to the j theta and r

00:47:42.290 --> 00:47:44.516
e to the minus j theta.

00:47:44.516 --> 00:47:50.720
But now, the coefficients we see
are r cosine theta and r sine

00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:51.850
theta.

00:47:51.850 --> 00:47:57.340
Quantization of r cosine theta
implies, as it did previously,

00:47:57.340 --> 00:48:00.590
that the poles must lie
along lines equally spaced

00:48:00.590 --> 00:48:02.390
along the horizontal axis.

00:48:02.390 --> 00:48:04.910
Quantization of r
sine theta implies

00:48:04.910 --> 00:48:08.390
that the poles must line
along lines equally spaced

00:48:08.390 --> 00:48:11.270
along the vertical,
or imaginary, axes.

00:48:11.270 --> 00:48:18.080
And so for that case, the choice
of realizable pole positions

00:48:18.080 --> 00:48:21.920
are governed by the
constellation of grid points

00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:23.840
that I've indicated here.

00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:29.510
So this is just simply,
this last issue,

00:48:29.510 --> 00:48:32.870
is just simply an
introduction to the fact

00:48:32.870 --> 00:48:37.310
that even given the notion that
the cascade form structure is

00:48:37.310 --> 00:48:39.620
better than the
direct form structure,

00:48:39.620 --> 00:48:43.610
there are additional issues
involved in specifically

00:48:43.610 --> 00:48:48.590
how to implement a pole pair,
or a pole zero combination

00:48:48.590 --> 00:48:52.990
in order to account for
parameter quantization effects.

00:48:52.990 --> 00:48:55.510
There are lots of
remaining issues,

00:48:55.510 --> 00:48:57.640
as you'll see in
the text, related

00:48:57.640 --> 00:49:01.300
to both the issues of
digital filter structures

00:49:01.300 --> 00:49:06.380
and the effects of parameter
and arithmetic finite register

00:49:06.380 --> 00:49:08.570
length effects, which
we won't be going

00:49:08.570 --> 00:49:10.740
into in this set of lectures.

00:49:10.740 --> 00:49:14.720
But you should at least be aware
be aware of their existence.

00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:17.840
In the next several
lectures, we'll

00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:21.350
begin on a new topic,
namely a discussion

00:49:21.350 --> 00:49:25.610
of some of the issues
involved in the design

00:49:25.610 --> 00:49:27.090
of digital filters.

00:49:27.090 --> 00:49:27.820
Thank you.

00:49:27.820 --> 00:49:31.170
