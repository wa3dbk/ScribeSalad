ALAN OPPENHEIM:
Throughout these lectures,

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.330
we have been considering the
analysis and the implementation

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:07.200
of discrete time linear
shift invariant systems,

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.670
or what we've been referring
to as digital filters.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.920
In this lecture, I
would like to begin

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.840
the discussion of the
design of digital filters.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.660
Now the rationale
for digital filters

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.160
is exactly the same as
it is for analog filters.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:31.080
In particular, we have taken
advantage several times

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.010
of the important
property of linear shift

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:39.960
in variance systems that complex
exponentials are eigenfunctions

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.880
of this class of systems.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.810
In other words, then with a
complex exponential input,

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.450
the output is a
complex exponential

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.500
of the same complex frequency
multiplied by the system

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.080
function H v to the j omega.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.830
Or equivalently, with
a sinusoidal input,

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.710
the output is
likewise sinusoidal

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.250
with the same frequency but
with a change in amplitude

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.100
and with a change in phase.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.380
Now what this property of
linear shift invariant systems

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.610
permits us to consider
is the separation

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.230
of signals that have been
added when these signals occupy

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.870
different frequency bands.

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.520
Specifically, we can
consider a signal composed

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.470
of the sum of two signals,
one of which we want,

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.240
the other of which
we don't want,

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.850
or we would like to suppress.

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.390
And if those two signals are
in different frequency bands--

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.820
in other words, their spectra
occupy different segments

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:54.180
of the frequency axis, then we
can choose the system function

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.210
for the linear shift
invariant system

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:01.680
so that it is unity in
the band of frequencies

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.580
that we want to keep and at
0 in the band of frequencies

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.590
that we want to reject.

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.560
That of course, is
exactly the same notion

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:16.000
as we have in continuous time
or analog systems or filters.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.620
So for example, if we
had a signal, which

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.000
was the sum of two components,
one of which was low frequency,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.580
and that we wanted to keep,
and the other of which

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.910
was high frequency and
that we wanted to suppress,

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.800
then we can consider
extracting the wanted signal

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.000
with a system whose
frequency response ideally

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.120
is unity at the
low frequency end

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.480
and at zero at the
high frequency end,

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.000
or after some cutoff frequency,
which I've denoted by omega sub

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.270
P.

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.790
So this then is
one type of filter

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.070
and one class of
filtering problems,

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:58.710
generally, what we
would refer to as

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:01.050
frequency selective filters.

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.380
We've illustrated that
here with the example

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.090
of a low-pass filter.

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.400
But of course there are
other kinds of frequency

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.430
selective filters--

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.140
for example,
high-pass, band-pass,

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:17.240
band-stop, multiple
band filters, et cetera.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:21.329
Furthermore, the
filtering problem,

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.790
both digital and
analog, is of course,

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:28.230
not restricted to just simply
frequency selective filters.

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:33.240
We can think of problems-- we
can talk about a wide variety

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.920
of problems, in fact--

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.950
where the frequency
characteristics

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:42.240
that are desired are not
piecewise constant as they

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.420
are in the frequency
selective filter case,

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:51.570
but might be non-piecewise
constant such as, for example,

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.100
with the case of a
differentiator, in which case

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.620
the desired frequency
characteristic is

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.460
in fact, linear with frequency,
or in the inverse filtering

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:06.230
problem where the desired
frequency characteristic is

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:09.350
in general of a somewhat
arbitrary shape.

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:11.360
And so in this
more general sense,

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.450
the filtering problem
can be thought

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:18.080
of in terms of
the implementation

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.200
of a linear shift
invariant system

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:25.520
with a specified frequency
response characteristic

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.370
that we wish to achieve.

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:33.060
To carry out the discussion,
all the discussion that

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.270
will be carrying out today
and in fact throughout most

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.420
of these lectures on
digital filter design,

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:44.265
I'll relate primarily to
frequency selective filters

00:05:44.265 --> 00:05:46.900
and in fact, to
low-pass filters,

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:51.000
although it's important to keep
in mind that the digital filter

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.940
problem, the digital
filter design problem,

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:58.600
is not restricted to just
that class of filters.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:02.920
Well, for the case of an
ideal low-pass filter,

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.950
or a low-pass filter, this
is the desired frequency

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:07.360
characteristic.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.400
And so what's the problem?

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:14.380
Well, we have seen in
the last several lectures

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:18.520
that for the implementation
of digital filters,

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:24.520
it's particularly convenient to
have a filter or a system whose

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:30.010
system function is representable
as a rational function of z,

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:33.520
or equivalently whose
input-output characteristic

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:39.190
can be related by means of a
linear constant coefficient

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:41.430
difference equation.

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:44.800
A linear constant coefficient
difference equation,

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.310
or a rational system
function, can't

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:52.420
achieve exactly an ideal
low-pass filter characteristic

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:55.870
as we have here, and in
general can't achieve

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:59.410
any ideal frequency
selective characteristic

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:02.530
where the transition
from one band to another

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:06.640
is as abrupt as we would
like it to be ideally.

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:12.190
So in fact, what's
required is to approximate

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:14.960
this ideal frequency
characteristic,

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:18.460
and the approximation
of the ideal frequency

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:23.320
characteristic, and the
design of a rational transfer

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:26.350
function to implement
that approximation

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:31.700
is what the digital filter
design problem is about.

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:35.800
So whereas we talk ideally
about a filter characteristic,

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:39.250
as I've indicated
here, in fact, we

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:43.480
have to allow some deviation
from this ideal characteristic

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:51.760
so that we would permit as an
example a frequency response,

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:55.410
rather than being
unity in the passband,

00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:58.180
to deviate from
unity by some amount.

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:02.690
And let's designate that
by say, delta sub P,

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:05.680
denoting a passband deviation.

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:08.320
So that in fact where
we might specify

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:12.770
is a filter which
in the passband,

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:15.520
in the band of frequencies
that we wish to pass,

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:18.010
rather than being
exactly unity, is

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:22.390
constrained in the
interval between unity

00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:25.940
and 1 minus delta sub P.

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:31.190
Similarly, we might permit
the frequency characteristics,

00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:37.309
rather than requiring them to be
exactly 0 in a stopband region.

00:08:37.309 --> 00:08:41.240
We might permit the frequency
characteristic to deviate

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:45.575
from 0 by some amount which
we can denote as delta sub

00:08:45.575 --> 00:08:51.560
S, which is the stopband
deviation, in which case

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:56.735
we would ask that the filter
fall between 0 and delta sub

00:08:56.735 --> 00:09:01.400
S, that is that the filter
that we actually design

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:06.150
be restricted to
this frequency range.

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:09.410
And finally recognizing
that in reality we

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:13.070
can't achieve a discontinuity in
the frequency response as sharp

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:16.940
as I've indicated here,
we would permit also

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:20.900
a transition region.

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:27.760
That is, we would permit
a region, after which

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:31.660
the frequency characteristic
must be below delta sub S,

00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:34.420
and before which the
frequency characteristic must

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:37.420
be between 1 and 1
minus delta sub P,

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:41.140
but allowing a region for
it to make the transition

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:44.130
from the passband
to the stopband.

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:48.990
So these are the kinds of
specifications on a filter.

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:52.620
And a typical kind of
characteristic then

00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:54.780
that might result
is a filter perhaps

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:58.920
that ripples between
these limits 1 and 1

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:01.620
minus delta sub P
in the passband,

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:06.840
and then makes the transition
into a stopband region

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:11.160
and perhaps wiggles around
in the stopband region,

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:15.720
sometimes perhaps touching
the limits and sometimes not.

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:20.950
So what the digital filter
design problem is then,

00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:24.390
is given a set of
specifications on the filter,

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:27.570
recognizing that we can
implement an ideal filter,

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:29.490
but in fact allowing
some deviation

00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:31.180
from the ideal filter.

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:33.600
The digital filter
design problem

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:39.900
is then to design a rational
transfer function, which

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:45.180
approximates in some sense,
this ideal filter maintaining

00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:50.100
the specifications of passband
and stopband deviation

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:52.290
that we've imposed
on the problem.

00:10:54.900 --> 00:11:00.300
Now, there are several
classes of design techniques

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:02.950
that we can consider.

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:05.360
The first class of
design techniques,

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:08.660
which in fact, we won't
be talking much about,

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:12.860
is the class that I've referred
to as analytical design

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:13.950
techniques.

00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:18.740
Basically what I mean by that
are design techniques that

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:23.720
permit the approximation of the
ideal frequency characteristic.

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:28.550
The approximation is carried out
through an analytical procedure

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:33.410
and results in a closed
form transfer function.

00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:36.290
That in fact is a
very common class

00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:43.170
of techniques for continuous
time or analog filter design.

00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:47.880
And that leads us to the second
class of design techniques,

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:50.070
namely the class of
design techniques

00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:54.500
that I refer to as
mapping continuous time

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:56.910
to discrete time.

00:11:56.910 --> 00:11:59.280
Well, why in the world
would we ever want a map

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:02.960
from continuous time
to discrete time?

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:08.440
Well, the reason, very
simply, is that a lot of work.

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:13.720
And a lot of results have
developed for the design

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:16.915
of continuous time filters.

00:12:16.915 --> 00:12:19.510
And in fact, a lot
of these procedures

00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:21.070
are analytical procedures.

00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:23.590
They lead to
analytical, or they lead

00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:27.310
to closed form designs and
their analytical procedures that

00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:28.930
can be used.

00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:34.270
Now, if it's possible
to map those designs

00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:38.350
to digital designs, then
in fact, that's something

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:41.290
we should do simply
to take advantage

00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:44.290
of the kinds of results that
have been worked out previously

00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:48.290
in the design of analog filters.

00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:50.220
An important point
to keep in mind,

00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:56.556
however, is that we don't
mean by this approximating

00:12:56.556 --> 00:13:00.030
an analog filter with
a digital filter.

00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:02.640
That's not the objective, that's
a point that we've stressed

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:03.870
throughout these lectures.

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:07.710
Our objective is not to
approximate an analog filter

00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:09.240
with a digital filter.

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:14.100
But if in fact, we can
utilize analog designs

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:16.560
in designing digital
filters, then that's

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:17.640
something we should do.

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:19.710
And in fact, there
are some procedures

00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:24.470
that allow us to do this
that are very successful.

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:27.590
The third class of
design techniques

00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:30.860
are what are referred
to as algorithmic

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:34.010
or computer-aided
design techniques.

00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:39.230
And the basic idea
here is that there

00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:42.230
are a variety of
algorithmic procedures,

00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:48.070
iterative procedures that we
can go through to carry out

00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:50.110
the digital filter design.

00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:55.780
And we'll see a brief
discussion of a number of these

00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:59.350
in the next several lectures,
both for infinite impulse

00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:04.030
response filters and for finite
impulse response filters.

00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:07.270
Now, in fact on the issue
of infinite impulse response

00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:10.420
and finite impulse
response, it turns out

00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:15.430
that it's convenient
to separate the design

00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:18.880
issues for infinite
impulse response

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:22.210
and for finite impulse
response filters.

00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:24.820
There are techniques for
the finite impulse response

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:28.780
case that are not applicable to
the infinite impulse response

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:30.970
case, and vice versa.

00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:34.540
And consequently, as we talk
about digital filter design

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:37.060
techniques, we'll
be talking first

00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:40.690
about the design of
infinite impulse response,

00:14:40.690 --> 00:14:43.420
or what we alternatively
refer to as

00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:46.780
recursive digital
filters, and then we'll

00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:50.320
talk separately about
some design procedures

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:55.430
for finite impulse response or
non-recursive digital filters.

00:14:55.430 --> 00:15:03.580
So for this lecture, and
in fact for this lecture

00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:07.450
and the next lecture, and in
fact for this and the next two

00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:10.300
lectures, we'll be
focusing entirely

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:14.020
on the design of
infinite impulse response

00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:15.334
digital filters.

00:15:15.334 --> 00:15:16.750
And in the lecture
following that,

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:20.050
we'll consider some design
procedures for finite impulse

00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:22.660
response filters.

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:26.980
All right, well, the
first class of procedures,

00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:30.190
design techniques that
I'd like to discuss,

00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:34.480
are ones related to mapping
from continuous time

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:35.860
to discrete time--

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:42.220
that is, taking analog
filter design techniques

00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:47.180
and utilizing them for the
design of digital filters.

00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:51.220
So the procedure
basically is that we're

00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:55.040
mapping from continuous
time to discrete time.

00:15:55.040 --> 00:16:01.310
We have a continuous time
system function, H sub a of S,

00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:04.770
which is the Laplace transform
of the impulse response,

00:16:04.770 --> 00:16:09.380
H sub a of T, the H
standing for analog.

00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:15.170
And we'd like to map that
to a digital filter transfer

00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:18.320
function, H of z,
or equivalently

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:23.570
map the impulse response
to a digital filter unit

00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:26.180
sample response, H of n.

00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:29.270
And we'd like to do this,
of course, in such a way

00:16:29.270 --> 00:16:34.790
that if this was a good filter
in the analog domain, then

00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:39.390
this will be a good filter
in the digital domain.

00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:43.740
Well, of course in designing
digital filters by implementing

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:47.340
and mapping of the type
that we're talking about,

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:49.680
there are some
obvious restrictions

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:52.440
that we would like
to impose, one

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:58.710
of which is that we would like
the behavior of H sub a of S,

00:16:58.710 --> 00:17:02.460
the analog system
function, on the j omega

00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:10.940
axis to map to a corresponding
behavior on the unit circle.

00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:15.339
The point, of course,
is that an analog system

00:17:15.339 --> 00:17:21.130
function or an analog filter, an
analog frequency response, when

00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:23.319
we talk about the
frequency response,

00:17:23.319 --> 00:17:27.040
we're looking in the
s-plane on the j omega axis.

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:31.810
And for the digital
filter, it is the behavior

00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:34.270
of the system function
on the unit circle

00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:38.020
that dictates what the
frequency response is like.

00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:41.500
If the analog filter has a
good frequency response--

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:45.710
in other words, it has a good
behavior on the j omega axis--

00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:48.280
that's what we would
like to have mapped over

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:54.380
to a good behavior in the
z-plane on the unit circle.

00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:57.550
So this then is
the first condition

00:17:57.550 --> 00:17:59.500
that we would like to impose.

00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:02.590
And a second condition that
it's reasonable to impose

00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:08.350
is that a stable
analog system function

00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:12.830
mapped to a stable
digital system function.

00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:15.560
In other words, we'd
like to be confident

00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:18.290
that our design
procedure is such

00:18:18.290 --> 00:18:21.230
that if we had a
good analog filter

00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:24.770
and it was stable, that
when we were all done,

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:27.860
we would end up with a good
digital filter that was also

00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:28.970
stable.

00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:33.050
So these, then, are two
of the conditions that

00:18:33.050 --> 00:18:36.590
are basic to any
design procedure that

00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:41.350
maps from continuous
time to discrete time.

00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:47.420
Well, there are a number of
procedures that are available.

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:50.230
One of the first
that tends to come

00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:53.740
to mind when you think of
mapping a continuous time

00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:56.920
filter to a discrete
time filter is

00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:59.470
to approximate in
some sense, let's

00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:03.100
say the differential equation
for the analog filter,

00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:07.760
by simply replacing the
derivatives by differences.

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:10.690
So the first method that
I'd like to talk about

00:19:10.690 --> 00:19:18.220
is a method which corresponds
to going from the analog filter

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:22.720
to the digital filter
by mapping differentials

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:25.450
in the analog domain
to differences

00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:27.940
in the digital domain.

00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:31.900
And let me tell you in
advance that what we'll see,

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:35.500
in fact, is that although
this is intuitively

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:39.220
one of the first methods
that tends to come to mind,

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:42.820
that in fact, it is not a
particularly good method

00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:46.730
in terms of the basic
guidelines that we've set down.

00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:49.480
But let's go through
the method anyway.

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:54.080
Here we have an analog system
function, H sub a of S.

00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:57.830
And the corresponding
differential equation,

00:19:57.830 --> 00:20:02.120
the filter then is described in
terms of a linear combination

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:06.140
of derivatives of the output
equal to a linear combination

00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:09.390
of derivatives of the input.

00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:13.400
Now we want to convert
this in some way

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:15.880
to a difference equation.

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:25.820
And so we can consider replacing
y sub a of t by y of n,

00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:29.270
y of n, of course is the
output of the digital filter,

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:33.980
in such a way that the
derivative, a first derivative

00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:39.510
sampled at t equal
to n times T gets

00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:42.870
replaced by the first
difference of the output

00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:45.030
of the digital filter.

00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:47.790
Where the first
difference I'm defining

00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:50.490
as the first forward difference.

00:20:50.490 --> 00:20:55.710
That is, y of n plus 1
minus y of n divided by T.

00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:58.530
So the idea here is
basically to say, well

00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:00.390
look, I can generate
a difference

00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:03.540
equation from this
differential equation

00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:07.530
by replacing the
derivatives by differences--

00:21:07.530 --> 00:21:09.630
in the particular case
I'm talking about,

00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:11.370
by forward differences.

00:21:11.370 --> 00:21:13.500
And what will result is
a difference equation,

00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:18.240
and consequently what also
results is a digital filter.

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:21.930
Incidentally, I'm
talking about this here

00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:25.980
for the case of forward
differences in the text

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:29.336
to see the contrast.

00:21:29.336 --> 00:21:31.710
We talk about a
similar procedure,

00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:34.350
but with the use of backward
differences rather than

00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:37.370
forward differences.

00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:41.420
All right, well let's see,
in fact, what happens then.

00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:45.530
We want to replace
a first derivative

00:21:45.530 --> 00:21:48.080
by a first forward difference.

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:49.970
More generally,
what we would want

00:21:49.970 --> 00:21:57.560
to replace a k-th derivative by
is the k-th forward difference,

00:21:57.560 --> 00:21:59.750
where the k-th
forward difference

00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:02.090
is defined iteratively.

00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:05.510
In other words, the k-th
forward difference of y of n

00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:08.300
is the first forward
difference of the k

00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:11.510
minus first forward
difference of y of n.

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:14.120
Simply the k-th
forward difference

00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:16.670
to correspond to
the k-th derivative

00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:20.840
is the first difference
implemented over and over

00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:23.870
and over again, k times.

00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:29.870
So what results then by
making this substitution,

00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:33.000
is that the differential
equation that we had,

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.650
which was a linear
combination of the derivatives

00:22:36.650 --> 00:22:40.340
of y of t equal to a linear
combination of the derivatives

00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:44.420
of x of t, that's replaced by
the same linear combination

00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:49.700
of the k-th difference of y of
n equal to the corresponding

00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:55.650
linear combination of the
k-th differences of x of n.

00:22:55.650 --> 00:23:00.510
And this then is a
difference equation,

00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:04.620
because of the fact that each
of these differences, each

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:07.440
of these four differences, or
the k-th forward difference,

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:09.850
involves differences of y of n.

00:23:09.850 --> 00:23:12.540
That is why even
plus 1 minus y of n

00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:17.760
So this is a difference equation
derived from the differential

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:20.850
equation by replacing
the k-th derivative

00:23:20.850 --> 00:23:23.690
by the k-th forward difference.

00:23:23.690 --> 00:23:28.100
Well let's see what this
means in terms of the mapping

00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:31.790
from the s-plane to the z-plane.

00:23:31.790 --> 00:23:36.170
First of all, let me remind
you that in the continuous time

00:23:36.170 --> 00:23:41.540
domain, the Laplace transform
of the derivative of a time

00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:46.860
function is equal to s times the
Laplace transform of the time

00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:47.360
function.

00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:51.690
That is, the operation of
differentiation in the Laplace

00:23:51.690 --> 00:23:57.470
transform domain gets carried
over to a multiplication by s.

00:23:57.470 --> 00:24:00.590
Similarly, we can look
at the z transform

00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:04.880
of the first difference,
the z transform

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:07.580
of the first difference,
y of n plus 1 minus y

00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:11.990
of n divided by T, simply by
applying the properties of z

00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:15.950
transforms, results
in z minus 1 divided

00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:21.590
by T times the z
transform of y of n.

00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:26.930
So the operation of taking the
first difference corresponds

00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:32.090
to multiplying the z transform
by z minus 1 divided by T.

00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:34.520
So in the continuous
time domain,

00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:38.090
the derivative corresponded
to multiplication by s.

00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:41.210
In the z transform
domain, first differencing

00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:43.850
corresponded to
multiplication by z minus 1

00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:47.930
divided by T. And it's
straightforward to show

00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:54.110
that, in fact, the k-th
forward difference corresponds

00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:57.680
to multiplying by z
minus 1 over t to the k.

00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:01.070
And we know that the k-th
derivative corresponds

00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:03.980
to multiplication by s to the k.

00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:07.970
So if you track that through,
put that into the difference

00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:11.870
equation, and obtain
the system function

00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:14.120
for the digital
system, and compare it

00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:19.770
with the system function for
the analog system, what you see

00:25:19.770 --> 00:25:26.090
resulting is that the operation
of replacing differentials

00:25:26.090 --> 00:25:32.330
by differences corresponds
to obtaining the transfer

00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:36.680
function of the digital
filter from the transfer

00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:41.120
function of the analog
filter by the substitution

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:46.950
s equal to z minus
1 divided by T.

00:25:46.950 --> 00:25:50.160
So it's basically
a mapping then,

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:54.720
S being replaced by
z minus 1 over T,

00:25:54.720 --> 00:26:00.510
or equivalently, z is
equal to 1 plus s times T.

00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:03.750
First point then is that
this technique in fact

00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:08.490
corresponds to a mapping from
the s-plane to the z-plane,

00:26:08.490 --> 00:26:13.420
with s replaced by
a function of z.

00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:16.120
Well, let's see what
this mapping is, in fact,

00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:20.410
and decide whether it satisfies
the objectives that we

00:26:20.410 --> 00:26:23.270
set down before.

00:26:23.270 --> 00:26:25.850
Here is a picture
of the s-plane,

00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:28.520
and here's the j omega axis.

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:33.860
Below we have the z-plane,
the imaginary axis, real axis,

00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:36.210
and the unit circle.

00:26:36.210 --> 00:26:41.090
And the first question
is, what does the j omega

00:26:41.090 --> 00:26:45.650
axis in the s-plane
map to in the z-plane?

00:26:45.650 --> 00:26:48.950
Well, we substitute
s equals j omega,

00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:55.310
so that z is equal to
1 plus j omega times T.

00:26:55.310 --> 00:26:59.870
Consequently, the j
omega axis in the s-plane

00:26:59.870 --> 00:27:06.170
for this particular method maps
to this line in the z-plane.

00:27:06.170 --> 00:27:07.580
Well, is that good?

00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:10.490
No, it's not good,
because it says

00:27:10.490 --> 00:27:15.840
that if we saw a good filter as
we ran up and down this axis,

00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:20.510
we would see a good filter as
we run up and down this line.

00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:25.540
However, where we are interested
in the filter characteristics

00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:28.820
ending up are on
the unit circle,

00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:31.850
which in fact, are only
close to this line when

00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:36.290
we're in the vicinity
of z equal to 1.

00:27:36.290 --> 00:27:40.250
So in fact, the first
condition that we wanted

00:27:40.250 --> 00:27:43.910
isn't satisfied, namely
the j omega axis does not

00:27:43.910 --> 00:27:47.710
get mapped to the unit circle.

00:27:47.710 --> 00:27:53.480
Furthermore, stable analog
filters do not necessarily

00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:55.830
map to stable digital filters.

00:27:55.830 --> 00:28:02.310
For example, if we had a pole,
let's say in the s-plane there,

00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:07.020
then it would fall in the
z-plane, let's say there.

00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:08.160
Well, that's all right.

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:12.480
That's a stable pole,
stable analog filter mapping

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:14.840
to a stable digital filter.

00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:20.430
However, here's an even
more stable analog filter.

00:28:20.430 --> 00:28:26.220
And if this pole is negative
enough, then in fact,

00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:29.250
it falls outside the unit
circle in the z-plane,

00:28:29.250 --> 00:28:33.750
and consequently the digital
filter will be unstable.

00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:36.630
That incidentally is
a well-known property

00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:40.200
in numerical analysis
of forward differences--

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:43.630
that is, the notion that forward
differences are unstable.

00:28:43.630 --> 00:28:45.750
And this is one
way of seeing that

00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:47.760
by interpreting it
in terms of a mapping

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:50.300
from the s-plane to the z-plane.

00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:55.880
We know incidentally that at
least in an intuitive sense,

00:28:55.880 --> 00:29:01.970
it's reasonable to imagine
that if we pick samples

00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:06.800
of a continuous time signal
close enough together, that

00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:08.870
at least intuitively
we ought to be

00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:14.120
able to approximate a
derivative by a difference.

00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:18.650
And in fact, that fits in
with the kinds of things

00:29:18.650 --> 00:29:21.686
that we've been seeing here
in the following sense.

00:29:21.686 --> 00:29:26.060
If we very highly oversample
the signal, much higher

00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:28.670
than the Nyquist
rate, then in fact,

00:29:28.670 --> 00:29:33.140
the portion of the z-plane
where the signal spectrum falls

00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:37.940
is the portion of the z-plane
around in the vicinity of z

00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:40.010
equal to 1.

00:29:40.010 --> 00:29:42.590
And you can see
that in that case,

00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:45.770
that portion of
the unit circle is

00:29:45.770 --> 00:29:48.560
pretty close to
this line which was

00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:53.420
the mapping from the j
omega axis into the z-plane.

00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:58.160
And so consequently, if we
oversample rather extensively,

00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:02.300
then we can, in fact, map,
more or less, our analog

00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:04.370
filter to a digital filter.

00:30:04.370 --> 00:30:07.900
But in fact, in the
more usual case,

00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:11.930
the digital signal spectrum
occupies the entire unit

00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:12.860
circle.

00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:15.570
And clearly away from
the regions equals 1,

00:30:15.570 --> 00:30:18.650
the unit circle deviates
rather dramatically

00:30:18.650 --> 00:30:20.960
from this vertical line.

00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:26.030
All right, so this is a
method then of filter design,

00:30:26.030 --> 00:30:31.370
which didn't satisfy either
one of our initial guidelines.

00:30:31.370 --> 00:30:35.510
Namely, it didn't map the j
omega axis to the unit circle.

00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:40.520
And also, it didn't map
a stable analog filter

00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:43.560
to a stable digital filter.

00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:49.010
Well, let's go on to a second
method, which is better

00:30:49.010 --> 00:30:51.020
in both of those respects.

00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:54.080
And this is a method
that is commonly

00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:59.000
referred to as the method
of impulse invariance.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:03.800
And again, it's a filter
design method, which

00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:07.700
intuitively is very reasonable.

00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:11.240
The basic idea of
impulse invariance

00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:18.570
is to convert an analog
filter to a digital filter,

00:31:18.570 --> 00:31:20.660
simply by choosing
the unit sample

00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:23.390
response of the
digital filter to be

00:31:23.390 --> 00:31:26.540
equally spaced
samples of the impulse

00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:28.950
response of the analog filter.

00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:32.140
So the unit sample
response h of n

00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:36.260
is chosen to be equally
spaced samples, samples spaced

00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:42.260
by T, equally spaced samples of
the analog or continuous time

00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:44.720
filter.

00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:52.180
Well, in at least one sense,
we can see that this certainly

00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:54.580
leads to a good filter.

00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:59.200
And that is, if we had
a continuous time analog

00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:04.180
filter that had good impulse
response characteristics,

00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:08.350
then those good impulse
response characteristics

00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:11.620
would be carried over to the
digital filter unit sample

00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:12.200
response.

00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:15.970
For example, if we were
interested in a filter

00:32:15.970 --> 00:32:19.900
with very low ringing or
very short impulse response,

00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:23.170
then if we had an analog filter
with those characteristics,

00:32:23.170 --> 00:32:26.800
then the digital filter would
likewise have good impulse

00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:29.600
response characteristics.

00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:31.930
However we've been phrasing
most of our discussion

00:32:31.930 --> 00:32:35.230
in terms of frequency
response characteristics,

00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:37.870
we know from the
discussion of sampling

00:32:37.870 --> 00:32:42.040
that we had a number of lectures
ago that periodic sampling

00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:48.040
of this type results
in a frequency response

00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:53.860
for the digital system,
which is basically

00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:56.440
an aliased version
of the frequency

00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:58.900
response for the analog system.

00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:04.510
That is, the digital frequency
response is given by the sum

00:33:04.510 --> 00:33:07.180
that I've indicated
here, which consists

00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:10.690
of scaled replicas
of the Fourier

00:33:10.690 --> 00:33:19.510
transform of the analog filter,
repeated over and over again

00:33:19.510 --> 00:33:24.760
with a spacing in
little omega of 2 pi.

00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:28.090
Well, let's take a look at
that in a little more detail.

00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:39.830
Here we have the analog
frequency response.

00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:42.860
And let's say that
we're considering

00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:45.020
this for the case of a
low-pass filter, which

00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:48.140
is what we've tended to
focus on in this lecture.

00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:51.560
So that if we had an
analog low-pass filter,

00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:55.910
cutoff frequency between minus
omega sub a and plus omega sub

00:33:55.910 --> 00:34:04.400
a, then in forming the digital
filter frequency response,

00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:10.520
we first want to form h sub
a of j omega divided by T,

00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:16.219
and then shift that in omega
by integer multiples of 2 pi

00:34:16.219 --> 00:34:18.210
and add up those results.

00:34:18.210 --> 00:34:20.719
So the first step
is the scaling,

00:34:20.719 --> 00:34:27.320
basically replacing Omega
by omega divided by T,

00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:32.120
in which case plotted
as a function of omega,

00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:36.889
the cutoff frequency is
then omega sub a T and minus

00:34:36.889 --> 00:34:44.540
omega sub a T, so that this
step results in a linear scaling

00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:48.739
of the frequency
axis so that Omega

00:34:48.739 --> 00:34:53.179
is replaced by
omega divided by T.

00:34:53.179 --> 00:34:57.800
The second step then
is to add together

00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:02.930
replicas of this analog
frequency response separated

00:35:02.930 --> 00:35:06.620
in omega by integer
multiples of 2 pi.

00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:09.260
And that's what
I've indicated here.

00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:12.470
Of course, this periodically
repeats over and over again,

00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:17.210
but I've sketched it just
from minus 2 pi to plus 2 pi.

00:35:17.210 --> 00:35:22.040
We have the factor 1 over T
out in front for the amplitude.

00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:25.640
But an important
aspect of this is

00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:29.600
that we have in going from
the analog frequency variable

00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:33.770
to the digital frequency
variable, a linear scaling

00:35:33.770 --> 00:35:36.080
in the frequency axis.

00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:37.760
That doesn't show
up particularly

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:40.370
for a piecewise constant
frequency characteristic

00:35:40.370 --> 00:35:41.750
as I have here.

00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:46.580
But generally, if I had
some complicated shape, then

00:35:46.580 --> 00:35:51.320
when I convert to h sub
a of j omega over T,

00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:54.120
that basic shape
will be preserved.

00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:58.970
And it will only be
distorted by a linear scaling

00:35:58.970 --> 00:36:00.530
in the frequency axis.

00:36:00.530 --> 00:36:03.020
And that is an
important advantage

00:36:03.020 --> 00:36:07.820
of the technique of
impulse invariance.

00:36:07.820 --> 00:36:11.120
Now there are some
problems, one in particular.

00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:13.810
And this is the major problem.

00:36:13.810 --> 00:36:17.750
And that is that as
I've drawn this example,

00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:21.800
we've considered an analog
filter whose frequency response

00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:23.990
is strictly bandlimited.

00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:28.070
And so of course there is
no aliasing that results.

00:36:28.070 --> 00:36:32.180
But more generally, the kind
of frequency characteristic

00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:40.580
that we would have would
look perhaps like this,

00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:44.780
as an approximation, admittedly
a somewhat crude approximation,

00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:47.390
to this ideal low-pass filter.

00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:51.440
In which case, as we
add up the replicas

00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:56.690
of the scaled frequency
response, then we in general

00:36:56.690 --> 00:36:59.450
will have interference
or aliasing

00:36:59.450 --> 00:37:02.090
between different
terms in this sum.

00:37:02.090 --> 00:37:06.170
So that in that case, while we
start with an analog frequency

00:37:06.170 --> 00:37:10.790
characteristic that's desirable,
the resulting digital frequency

00:37:10.790 --> 00:37:14.960
characteristic will
be distorted somewhat

00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:18.590
because of the
aliasing that results

00:37:18.590 --> 00:37:22.830
due to the separate terms that
are added together in this sum.

00:37:22.830 --> 00:37:28.790
And one of the important aspects
of implementing an impulse

00:37:28.790 --> 00:37:31.700
invariant filter
design, then, is

00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:34.760
to in some way account
for and hopefully

00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:37.640
minimize the effect
of this aliasing.

00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:42.770
All right, so with the
impulse invariant method,

00:37:42.770 --> 00:37:48.680
one of the important advantages
of impulse invariance

00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:53.360
is the fact that it tends
to preserve good time domain

00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:54.470
characteristics.

00:37:54.470 --> 00:37:59.100
That is, the impulse response
characteristics were preserved.

00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:06.570
And also, it provides
a linear scaling

00:38:06.570 --> 00:38:09.960
from analog frequency
to digital frequency

00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:14.790
so that if we had an analog
filter with a very complicated

00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:17.430
frequency response,
then we could

00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:20.370
be assured that the
corresponding digital filter

00:38:20.370 --> 00:38:25.240
except for aliasing would
have that same shape,

00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:29.600
but only with a linear
scaling of the frequency axis.

00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:31.710
It should be pointed
out incidentally

00:38:31.710 --> 00:38:36.840
that impulse invariance
doesn't imply step invariance,

00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:39.030
and you'll see this
in the problems

00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:41.190
that you work through
the study guide.

00:38:41.190 --> 00:38:44.580
Impulse invariance does not
imply step invariance so

00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:48.360
that in fact, if it was the
step response characteristics

00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:52.260
that we wanted to preserve,
then the technique here

00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:53.490
isn't what we would use.

00:38:53.490 --> 00:38:55.170
We would use a
modified technique,

00:38:55.170 --> 00:38:57.860
which would be not impulse
invariance, but step

00:38:57.860 --> 00:39:00.000
invariance.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.650
Well, let's finally look
at what impulse invariance

00:39:04.650 --> 00:39:09.330
means in terms of a mapping
from the s-plane to the z-plane.

00:39:09.330 --> 00:39:11.640
Let's look at it in a
slightly different way

00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:14.350
than we've looked at it here.

00:39:14.350 --> 00:39:21.420
And we can do that by expressing
the analog system function

00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:25.950
in a partial fraction expansion,
in terms of a sum of factors

00:39:25.950 --> 00:39:26.670
of this form.

00:39:26.670 --> 00:39:33.480
So we have residues A sub k,
poles s at s equals s of k,

00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:35.580
and we're expressing
the system function

00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:39.640
as a linear combination
of terms of this form.

00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:41.350
If there are
multiple order poles,

00:39:41.350 --> 00:39:43.720
this expression is
slightly more complicated.

00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:48.010
And what I'm about to say can
be generalized to that case.

00:39:48.010 --> 00:39:51.670
But let's consider it here just
for the case of simple poles,

00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:53.620
so that the system
function in fact

00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:57.750
can be expanded out in
the form that I have here.

00:39:57.750 --> 00:40:01.530
All right, well, if this is
the analog system function,

00:40:01.530 --> 00:40:06.710
then you should recall that
the analog impulse response--

00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:09.720
that is, the inverse
Laplace transform of this--

00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:14.790
is the sum of exponentials
with amplitudes

00:40:14.790 --> 00:40:17.580
A sub k, the same
amplitudes as we

00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:22.950
have here, and complex
exponentials e to s sub k.

00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:29.400
And this should be a t,
not a T. That is time, t.

00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:32.560
So this then is the form
of the impulse response,

00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:35.730
which corresponds to
this system function.

00:40:35.730 --> 00:40:40.230
And now the impulse
invariant method says,

00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:43.950
replace this by a
unit sample response

00:40:43.950 --> 00:40:46.590
for the digital filter,
which is obtained

00:40:46.590 --> 00:40:52.170
by replacing t by
n times T. That is,

00:40:52.170 --> 00:40:55.710
obtaining the unit sample
response of the digital filter

00:40:55.710 --> 00:41:00.840
by sampling the impulse response
of the analog filter, in which

00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:07.140
case we get the sum of
A sub k, E to s of k.

00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:13.420
And now time, t, is
replaced by n times T.

00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:18.000
A sampled unit step, a
sampled analog unit step,

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:22.080
results in a discrete
time unit step.

00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:24.930
And so consequently,
the unit sample response

00:41:24.930 --> 00:41:28.950
that we end up with is A
sub k, the same coefficients

00:41:28.950 --> 00:41:33.750
as we had here, e to the
s sub k, n times T times

00:41:33.750 --> 00:41:35.910
the unit step.

00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:39.450
Well, we can write that in
a slightly different way.

00:41:39.450 --> 00:41:43.920
We can write that as
the sum of A sub k,

00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:48.390
and some factor, e to the
s sub k T is what it is.

00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:52.860
Some factor raised to the n-th
power times the unit step.

00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:56.430
And consequently we can
write down by inspection

00:41:56.430 --> 00:42:00.660
the z transform or system
function that corresponds

00:42:00.660 --> 00:42:02.880
to this unit sample response.

00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:09.330
In particular, it is H of
z equal to the sum of A sub

00:42:09.330 --> 00:42:15.780
k, times 1 minus 8, e the s
of k times T z to the minus 1,

00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:20.401
that's simply by inspection
of this expression.

00:42:20.401 --> 00:42:20.900
All right.

00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:25.870
Well, so we started
with an analog system

00:42:25.870 --> 00:42:32.010
function of this form, these
coefficients in these poles.

00:42:32.010 --> 00:42:35.130
We ended up with a
digital system function

00:42:35.130 --> 00:42:38.820
of this form, the same
coefficients, and poles

00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:42.290
instead of at s sub k, as
they were in the analog case,

00:42:42.290 --> 00:42:46.260
at e to the s sub k T.

00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:51.690
So this says then that the
impulse invariant method

00:42:51.690 --> 00:42:57.660
maps a pole in the s-plane
which was at s sub k, maps

00:42:57.660 --> 00:43:02.430
it to a pole in the
z-plane at z equal

00:43:02.430 --> 00:43:07.200
to e to the s sub
k, T. Well, does

00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:10.500
that mean that impulse
invariance is basically

00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:14.940
a method which maps
s to z according

00:43:14.940 --> 00:43:17.700
to this transformation.

00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:19.550
Well no, it doesn't do that.

00:43:19.550 --> 00:43:23.000
What it does is it maps
the poles in the s-plane

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:27.630
to poles in the z-plane
according to this mapping.

00:43:27.630 --> 00:43:29.220
The other thing
that it preserves

00:43:29.220 --> 00:43:32.400
are these coefficients,
the coefficients A sub k,

00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:34.380
that is the residues
of the poles.

00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:36.960
So it maintains the
residues of the poles.

00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:41.610
It maps the poles according
to z equals e to the st.

00:43:41.610 --> 00:43:45.220
The 0s, by the way,
in general will not

00:43:45.220 --> 00:43:48.130
come out to have
been mapped according

00:43:48.130 --> 00:43:51.530
to the same mappings equals
e to the st. In other words,

00:43:51.530 --> 00:43:56.320
if we had a 0 at s equals s
sub 0, as we'll see actually

00:43:56.320 --> 00:44:00.160
in an example that we'll work
next time, the 0 in the z-plane

00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:05.620
will not come out, will not come
out at z equals e to the s 0 T.

00:44:05.620 --> 00:44:08.180
The poles are mapped
according to that mapping,

00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:09.820
and the residues are preserved.

00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:13.070
And that is essentially what
defines the impulse invariant

00:44:13.070 --> 00:44:15.520
mapping.

00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:18.880
Well, we had our two
initial guidelines.

00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:21.970
One is that we want the
behavior on the j omega

00:44:21.970 --> 00:44:28.150
axis to map to the behavior in
the digital domain on the unit

00:44:28.150 --> 00:44:29.620
circle.

00:44:29.620 --> 00:44:32.200
Does the impulse
invariant method do that?

00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:36.670
Well, it does, except for
the effect of aliasing.

00:44:36.670 --> 00:44:42.130
But basically, it is the
analog frequency response

00:44:42.130 --> 00:44:45.610
that dictates what the
digital frequency response is.

00:44:45.610 --> 00:44:48.940
And so in that sense,
impulse invariance

00:44:48.940 --> 00:44:51.040
satisfies that objective.

00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:54.210
The second question is
whether it maintains

00:44:54.210 --> 00:44:56.260
the ability of the filter.

00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:58.350
And the answer there
also is that it does,

00:44:58.350 --> 00:45:00.280
so we can see that very easily.

00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:06.140
In particular, if we have an
analog pole with a real part

00:45:06.140 --> 00:45:09.030
sigma sub k, an
imaginary part omega sub

00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:15.440
k, then the digital pole, the
pole of the digital filter,

00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:20.756
maps to z sub k equal
to e to the s sub k T,

00:45:20.756 --> 00:45:28.670
e to the j omega sub k T.
And the magnitude of this

00:45:28.670 --> 00:45:34.040
is equal to of course, the
product of the magnitudes.

00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:38.390
The magnitude of
this term is unity.

00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:41.940
So all that we care about is
the magnitude of the sigma

00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:46.930
sub k T. Well, if the
analog filter is stable,

00:45:46.930 --> 00:45:49.060
sigma sub k is negative.

00:45:49.060 --> 00:45:51.960
If sigma sub k is negative,
then either the sigma

00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:55.590
sub k T has a
magnitude less than 1.

00:45:55.590 --> 00:46:01.430
So consequently, if the real
part of s sub k is less than 0,

00:46:01.430 --> 00:46:05.300
negative, then the
magnitude of z sub k,

00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:09.210
the magnitude of the
pole is less than 1.

00:46:09.210 --> 00:46:15.620
So this in fact is a digital
filter design technique that

00:46:15.620 --> 00:46:19.900
has a number of advantages.

00:46:19.900 --> 00:46:24.010
And in fact, it's a very
useful design technique.

00:46:24.010 --> 00:46:29.390
It's one of the standard digital
filter design techniques.

00:46:29.390 --> 00:46:33.680
In the next lecture,
I will briefly

00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:38.810
present an example of an impulse
invariant design, just simply

00:46:38.810 --> 00:46:41.660
to remind you actually
again of the fact

00:46:41.660 --> 00:46:45.650
that aliasing is an issue,
number one, and number two,

00:46:45.650 --> 00:46:49.730
that it maps poles according
to z equals z to the st,

00:46:49.730 --> 00:46:51.170
but not 0s.

00:46:51.170 --> 00:46:54.110
In fact, the 0s end
up someplace else.

00:46:54.110 --> 00:46:57.230
And in addition in
that lecture, we'll

00:46:57.230 --> 00:47:02.450
talk about another design
technique, which is likewise

00:47:02.450 --> 00:47:05.060
one of the classical
digital filter design

00:47:05.060 --> 00:47:09.080
methods, which is referred to
as the bilinear transformation.

00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:11.690
And the lecture
following that then I

00:47:11.690 --> 00:47:17.030
will show some examples
of some digital filter

00:47:17.030 --> 00:47:20.870
designs, using both impulse
invariance and the bilinear

00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:22.510
transformation to compare them.

00:47:22.510 --> 00:47:24.260
Thank you.
