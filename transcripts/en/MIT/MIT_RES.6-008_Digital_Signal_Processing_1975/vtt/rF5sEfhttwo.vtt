00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.410
ALAN OPPENHEIM: Hi.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.420
So it turns out that
you guys missed out

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.210
on some of the best parts
of these lectures, which

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.940
is all the kibitzing that
goes on in back of the cameras

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.090
just before they get started.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.490
Well, in the last lecture,
we stressed the equivalence

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.060
of finite length and
periodic sequences.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.790
In particular, as
hopefully you recall,

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:28.400
we talked about a finite
length sequence, x of n,

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.040
which was of length
capital N. In other words,

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:39.380
it's equal to 0, except in the
range 0 to capital N minus 1.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.240
We stressed also the fact that
if the sequence is considered

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.360
a finite length
capital N, then it

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.990
can also be considered of
longer length than that,

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.530
or equivalently the statement
that it's a finite length

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.220
doesn't imply that some of the
values in the interval 0 to N

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.720
minus 1 can't also be 0.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.910
In relating a finite
length sequence

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.740
to a periodic sequence, we
generated a periodic sequence,

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.090
x tilde of n, by simply
repeating the finite length

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.770
sequence over and over again
with a period of capital

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:24.500
N. That is x of n was added to
itself, shifted by capital N,

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.190
shifted by 2 capital N,
shifted by 3 capital N.

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.960
And because of the fact
that it's a finite length,

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.120
there is no interference
between each

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.450
of these individual
replicas of x of n.

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.330
The result then is
a periodic sequence,

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.770
one period of which corresponds
to the finite length sequence.

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.190
Well, we'll have
occasion frequently

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.430
to refer to this
periodic sequence

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.420
in describing the
finite length sequence.

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.130
And consequently it's
convenient to use

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.640
a slightly different
notation than the summation

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.440
that we've been using.

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.590
In particular, we
can rewrite this

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.600
as the periodic
sequence, x tilde

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:15.370
of n, equal to x of
n modulo capital N.

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:22.410
That is x of n modulo capital
N, in other words, the argument

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:28.860
of x of n is little n taken
modulo capital N. Another way

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.760
of writing that notationally
which is convenient,

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.230
is just to simply express
that as a double parentheses

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.260
with a subscript
capital N, so that this

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:46.530
means x of n, the argument
n, taken modulo capital N.

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.570
So, you can see then
that as little n varies

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.260
over the interval 0
to capital N minus 1,

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:01.650
we see the finite length
sequence x of n as little n

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:08.340
is equal to capital N. Capital
N taken modulo, capital N is 0.

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.760
So we'll see x of 0 back again.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.840
And as little n varies
in the range capital N

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.850
to 2 capital N minus 1.

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.730
That argument taken
modulo N again

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:25.830
repeats the values of x
of n the range n equals 0

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.410
to capital N minus 1.

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.680
Expressing it this way or
equivalently expressing it

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.910
this way, as I stressed before
in the previous lecture,

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:40.610
corresponds to taking the
finite length sequence, x of n,

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.660
and simply wrapping it
around the circumference

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.310
of a cylinder.

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.230
As we run around the
circumference of the cylinder,

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:52.610
we see x of n repeated
over and over again.

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:56.660
Likewise, we were able to
get back to the finite length

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.930
sequence from the
periodic sequence

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.410
by simply multiplying by
a rectangular sequence,

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:06.860
in other words extracting
a single period.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.740
A single period of
the periodic sequence

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:14.610
corresponds to the finite length
sequence that we began with.

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.730
In the last lecture we then
introduced the discrete Fourier

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:22.890
series of x tilde of n,
and the discrete Fourier

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:27.360
series coefficients we denoted
as capital X tilde of k,

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.090
and chose to interpret
them, as you recall,

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:36.420
as a periodic sequence, periodic
in k with a period of capital

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:41.760
N. The discrete Fourier
series representation, just

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:45.210
to summarize it
again for you, we've

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:49.530
rewritten here that is a
sum of complex exponentials

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:54.000
harmonically related
generate x tilde of n.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.840
And the Fourier series
coefficients, capital X tilde

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:01.450
of k were given by
this expression.

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:04.500
And I stress again
the fact that we

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.760
chose to interpret the
Fourier series coefficients

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:10.620
as a periodic sequence.

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:14.890
And it didn't particularly
matter, because in any case

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:17.670
we only use a single
period of that

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:23.370
in constructing the periodic
sequence, x tilde of n.

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:25.650
Now in this lecture,
what we'd like to do

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:29.640
is apply the idea of
the discrete Fourier

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:33.960
series and the similarity
or basically the equivalence

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.930
of finite length and
periodic sequences

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:42.240
to a Fourier series
representation of finite length

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.800
sequences.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:48.450
And basically the
idea is that we

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:51.120
can convert the
finite length sequence

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.560
to a periodic sequence.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.340
We've seen how to do that,
and go back and forth.

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:59.730
Generate a Fourier series
representation for that,

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:03.210
and then simply interpret the
Fourier series coefficients

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:06.870
as what we'll call the
discrete Fourier transform

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:09.780
of the finite length sequence.

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:13.590
So, the discrete
Fourier transform then

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:18.080
is given by the
sum from n equals 0

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:22.140
to capital N minus
1 of x of n times

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:28.260
w sub capital N to the nk,
corresponding to the fact

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:36.060
that if we generate a
periodic sequence from x of n,

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:40.290
we can recognize that in this
summation for the Fourier

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:43.410
series coefficients,
in fact, we only

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:47.940
use one period of x
tilde of n anyway.

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:53.484
So that we could simply replace
in here x tilde of n by x of n.

00:07:53.484 --> 00:07:54.900
And of course,
since the summation

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:57.570
runs from 0 to
capital N minus 1,

00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:00.610
we can't tell the difference.

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:07.080
This then is by definition
the discrete Fourier transform

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:12.030
of the finite length
sequence, x of n.

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:18.220
And it is denoted by x of k.

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:21.460
It corresponds to the
Fourier series coefficients

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:26.170
of the periodic equivalent
sequence for x of n,

00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:29.530
except that it is
useful to maintain

00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:33.580
the duality between the time
domain and frequency domain

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:37.169
by interpreting the
Fourier transform,

00:08:37.169 --> 00:08:40.510
the discrete Fourier transform
to be a finite length

00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:44.275
sequence, since the sequence
that we're computing

00:08:44.275 --> 00:08:47.500
the Fourier transform
from likewise

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:50.630
starts as a finite
length sequence.

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:52.490
Well, that's straightforward.

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:57.700
It just simply involves taking
the Fourier series coefficients

00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:03.210
for k in the range 0
to capital N minus 1,

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:08.450
and simply setting them
to 0 outside that range.

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:12.320
In other words, the
discrete Fourier transform,

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:18.020
x of k of a finite
length sequence x of n,

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:23.500
is equal to the Fourier
series coefficients

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:28.950
of the periodic
equivalent of x of n

00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:32.400
multiplied by a
rectangular sequence

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:34.150
to extract a single period.

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:40.800
We can likewise then get the
Fourier series coefficients

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:44.910
from the discrete Fourier
transform, x of k,

00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:48.240
by simply periodically
repeating x

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:53.220
of k with a period of capital
N. Or equivalently, we

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:58.410
can write that the Fourier
series coefficients, x tilde

00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:04.110
of k, are equal to the discrete
Fourier transform values

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:10.890
with the argument taken modulo
capital N. This corresponds

00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:15.150
to simply periodically
repeating capital X of k,

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:19.020
like wrapping capital X of
k around the circumference

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:22.290
of a cylinder, running around
the circumference again

00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:23.590
and again.

00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:28.200
And what we see are the
Fourier series coefficients.

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:32.640
Now perhaps this sounds a
little involved or intricate.

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:35.290
The idea is really very simple.

00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:40.590
It just simply is that the
discrete Fourier transform

00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:43.380
corresponds to
the Fourier series

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:48.270
coefficients for the periodic
equivalent of the finite length

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:49.530
sequence.

00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:52.450
And to maintain the
duality, in this case,

00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:55.710
we choose to simply extract one
period of the Fourier series

00:10:55.710 --> 00:11:00.840
coefficients so that now we
have a finite length sequence.

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:04.345
Its discrete Fourier transform
is likewise a finite length

00:11:04.345 --> 00:11:04.845
sequence.

00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:11.930
And the properties of the
discrete Fourier transform,

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:15.420
as we'll see, the
differences in the properties

00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:17.430
between this and the
Fourier transforms

00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:21.690
we've talked about in previous
lectures are related very

00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:26.100
closely to the implied
periodicity in the sequence

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:30.690
or in the discrete
Fourier transform.

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:32.250
Before discussing
the properties,

00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:37.800
however, it's useful to relate
the discrete Fourier transform

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:41.820
to the Z transform, as we've
talked about it previously.

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:47.740
In particular, here we
have the Fourier transform,

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:54.330
the discrete Fourier transform
relationship, capital X of k

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:58.650
is the sum from n equals
capital N minus 1 of x of n,

00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:01.290
w sub N to the nk.

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:08.610
Although that has to be
multiplied by R sub n of k

00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:11.490
to extract a single period.

00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:15.400
The inverse discrete Fourier
transform relationship

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:20.660
then is the inverse
Fourier series relationship

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:25.500
1 over capital N the sum
x sub k w sub of capital

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:27.930
N to the minus nk.

00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:31.500
And again, since we're
no longer talking

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:35.280
about a periodic sequence,
it's necessary to extract

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:44.190
one period, this multiplied
by R sub capital N of n.

00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:46.470
On the other hand,
the Z transform

00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:51.580
of the finite length sequence
is the sum of x of n times

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:54.090
z to the minus n.

00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:56.010
In general, of course,
the sum running

00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:58.560
from minus infinity
to plus infinity,

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:01.680
but because this is a
finite length sequence,

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:08.175
this is a sum from n equals
0 to capital N minus 1,

00:13:08.175 --> 00:13:11.430
because of the fact
that the sequence x of n

00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:17.530
is 0 outside the range n equals
zero to capital N minus 1.

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:22.710
Well, to relate the Z transform
to the discrete Fourier

00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:29.100
transform, we simply need
to compare this expression

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:31.360
with this expression.

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:34.530
And what we see,
ignoring for a moment

00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:40.440
the capital R sub N of k,
that these two expressions are

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:48.900
equal if we pick z equal to w
sub capital N to the minus k.

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:54.120
So the discrete Fourier
transform coefficients

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:58.500
are equal to the
Z transform, if we

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:08.100
choose z equal to w sub
capital N to the minus k,

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:13.340
and look at this for
values of k equal to 0,

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:18.116
1, up through capital N minus 1.

00:14:18.116 --> 00:14:22.970
What that says then, is that
the discrete Fourier transform

00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:26.270
corresponds to samples
of the Z transform;

00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:27.740
and where are those samples?

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:30.950
Well, those samples
are on the unit circle.

00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:35.930
Because the magnitude
of w is equal to 1.

00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:39.260
And for example, if we
chose the case were capital

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:44.660
N was equal to 8, then we would
find that the discrete Fourier

00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:49.370
transform coefficients fall
at points on the unit circle,

00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:55.550
equally spaced in angle with
eight points around the unit

00:14:55.550 --> 00:15:01.080
circle; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:02.430
I did it right.

00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:07.560
So these are equally-spaced
points around the unit circle.

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:12.540
For capital N equal to 8, then
the discrete Fourier transform

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:17.040
corresponds to sampling the
Z transform at these eight

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:18.960
points.

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:22.650
And then the only effect that
this capital R sub N of k

00:15:22.650 --> 00:15:27.090
has is that it requires
that we interpret this

00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:31.052
as a finite length sequence,
the set of eight values,

00:15:31.052 --> 00:15:33.510
rather than running around,
and around, and around the unit

00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:37.100
circle over and over again.

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:41.260
So, we have then the
discrete Fourier transform.

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:44.830
We have the notion that the
discrete Fourier transform

00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:46.720
really is nothing different.

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:50.020
It's exactly the same as
the discrete Fourier series,

00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:52.180
except that it's one period
of a discrete Fourier

00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:54.220
series extracted.

00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:58.240
And furthermore, it
corresponds to sampling

00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:01.810
the Z transform at
equally-spaced points

00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:04.000
around the unit circle.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.220
Apparently because of the
fact that the sequence

00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:09.580
is finite length, from
that set of samples

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:14.350
we're able to get back
exactly the sequence x of n.

00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:16.780
That isn't obviously
true, in general.

00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:19.390
If we had an arbitrary
x of n, and we

00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:22.420
sampled a Z transform
around the unit circle,

00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:26.530
in general we wouldn't be
able to get x of n back again.

00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:28.840
But if x of n is
a finite length,

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:32.500
then we are able
to obtain x of n

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:36.890
from the samples
of its Z transform.

00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:37.390
OK.

00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:40.000
Well, I'd like now
to look at some

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.190
of the properties of the
discrete Fourier transform.

00:16:44.190 --> 00:16:46.870
Again, there are
lots of properties

00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:48.020
that we can talk about.

00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:50.860
I'll focus on a
few, and primarily

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:54.070
what I want to focus
on is the difference

00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:58.000
between the properties for
the discrete Fourier transform

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.940
and the properties for
the Fourier transform

00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:05.079
or the Z transform as we
have been talking about them

00:17:05.079 --> 00:17:07.660
over the last several lectures.

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:14.560
Well, let's look first of
all at the shifting property.

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:19.119
And let me stress that
all of the properties,

00:17:19.119 --> 00:17:21.880
as we go through them,
as we present them

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:24.220
for the discrete
Fourier transform,

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:29.440
will relate to the
corresponding property

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:33.100
for the periodic equivalent
of the finite length sequence.

00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:36.700
So when we want to ask what
happens to the discrete Fourier

00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:40.780
transform when we do such
and such to the sequence,

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:44.440
the basic idea that
basically what we want to ask

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:47.740
is what happens to the
Fourier series coefficients

00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:52.310
for the periodic equivalent of
that finite length sequence.

00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:52.810
All right.

00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:56.500
Let's talk about the
shifting property.

00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:59.560
We have a sequence, x of n.

00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:05.020
It has a discrete Fourier
transform capital X of k.

00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:07.960
And then we have the
periodic equivalent

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:10.630
of x of n, x tilde of n.

00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:15.070
And it has a discrete
Fourier series coefficients,

00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:19.870
which are the periodic extension
of the discrete Fourier

00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:22.780
transform.

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:26.140
Well, the shifting property
that we want to introduce then

00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:29.350
corresponds to the
finite length sequence

00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:34.460
which is implied by shifting
the periodic sequence, x tilde

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:36.770
of n.

00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:41.650
We know that if we shift the
periodic sequence, x tilde

00:18:41.650 --> 00:18:47.850
of n plus m, the Fourier
series coefficients

00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:52.680
that we get are x
tilde of k multiplied

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:57.330
by a complex exponential w
sub capital N to the minus km.

00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:03.720
So the shifting property that
we want to introduce then

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:07.410
for the discrete
Fourier transform,

00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:12.450
corresponds to extracting
shifting x of n in such a way

00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:14.820
that it corresponds
to extracting

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:19.890
one period of the shifted
periodic sequence, x

00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:21.780
tilde of n.

00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:28.140
If we do that, if we extract
one period of x1 tilde of n

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:30.960
to get a finite
length sequence back,

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:36.130
then we get a discrete
Fourier transform,

00:19:36.130 --> 00:19:38.370
which corresponds to
extracting one period

00:19:38.370 --> 00:19:40.930
of this periodic sequence.

00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:44.880
And that then is simply the
original discrete Fourier

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:49.560
transform capital X of k
multiplied again by w sub

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:52.800
capital N to the minus km.

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:55.080
Now this shifting that
we're talking about

00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:57.660
is a little different
than the kind

00:19:57.660 --> 00:20:01.530
of shifting that we've been
doing normally in the Fourier

00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:03.540
transform and Z transform.

00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:04.890
And it has to be.

00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:07.140
Because we're talking
about a sequence

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:09.330
that's a finite length.

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:14.050
That is it's 0 outside the
range, 0 to capital N minus 1.

00:20:14.050 --> 00:20:18.780
And if we just simply shift
that sequence linearly,

00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:22.800
then we're going to end up with
a sequence that no longer is 0

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:25.780
outside the range 0
to capital N minus 1.

00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:27.420
So there's a slightly
different kind

00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:29.910
of shifting that
we're talking about.

00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:32.710
It's referred to as
a circular shift.

00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:37.800
and I'd like to illustrate what
that shifting corresponds to

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:39.460
by referring to one
of the view graphs.

00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:51.240
Here I have a sequence, x of
n, which is a finite length.

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:57.870
So it's nonzero only in the
region of the blue values.

00:20:57.870 --> 00:21:02.760
And to generate the shifted,
quote, "shifted" version

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:07.410
of x of n, we first generated
the periodic sequence,

00:21:07.410 --> 00:21:09.750
x tilde of n.

00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:12.990
So this is the periodic
replica or equivalent

00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:15.270
of this finite length sequence.

00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:17.820
So we simply have this
period repeated over here,

00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:20.700
repeated here, repeated
there, et cetera.

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:24.540
It was this sequence
that we shift.

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:31.000
So for example, if we shifted
to the left by two values,

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.370
we then have this periodic
sequence shifted to the left

00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:37.530
by two values.

00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:43.230
But to recover, to extract one
period again in the range 0

00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:49.200
to capital N minus 1, we
want to extract this period

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:51.570
of this periodic sequence.

00:21:51.570 --> 00:21:56.220
That's what the function
capital R sub capital N of n

00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:57.480
does for us.

00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:04.410
And the result then is this one
period extracted, and the rest

00:22:04.410 --> 00:22:06.550
of the sequence, 0.

00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:10.350
Now, we could of course, when
we go through this shifting,

00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:13.350
carry ourselves through
all of these steps.

00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:16.020
But there's a more
straightforward way

00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:19.080
to look at how you get
this sequence directly

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:21.030
from this one.

00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:25.620
You can see that we
could have interpreted

00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:31.140
the change from here to here,
either by linearly shifting

00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:34.560
this sequence or
by taking each one

00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:39.600
of the periods in this sequence
and circularly shifting.

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:42.450
As this shifts to the
left, taking points

00:22:42.450 --> 00:22:45.900
as they drop out of this
period and recirculating them

00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:47.790
around to the beginning
of the period,

00:22:47.790 --> 00:22:50.170
or to the side of the period.

00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:54.780
Well, you can see that that's
in essence, what we got here.

00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:57.550
And in fact, it's in
essence, what we get here.

00:22:57.550 --> 00:23:03.450
This corresponds not to
a linear shift of x of n,

00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:08.670
but to a circular
shift of x of n.

00:23:08.670 --> 00:23:11.970
As we shift this sequence
to the left by two

00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:17.970
values, instead of just simply
having these points drop off

00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:21.930
the end of this period
from 0 to n minus 1,

00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:24.670
we wrap them around
to the other side

00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:27.960
so that they come
in over here instead

00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:30.840
of wrapping around there.

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:35.490
Now one way to look at
this is to think of x of n,

00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:37.530
again as we've
been trying to do,

00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:41.280
wrapped around the
circumference of a cylinder.

00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:43.650
And what we've done
in the kind of shift

00:23:43.650 --> 00:23:46.260
that we're talking
about here, is

00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:51.060
just simply rotated the cylinder
by two points, rather than

00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:53.280
the usual kind of
linear shift where

00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:56.220
we have the sequence stretched
out in a straight line

00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:58.980
and we shift the
sequence linearly.

00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:00.960
Here we have a circular shift.

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:03.360
Think of the sequence wrapped
around the circumference

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:08.100
of a cylinder, and the cylinder
just rotated by two points

00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:13.290
so that the result is that the
two points that are shifted out

00:24:13.290 --> 00:24:15.855
of this window between
0 and n minus 1

00:24:15.855 --> 00:24:19.290
get shifted in from
the other side.

00:24:19.290 --> 00:24:24.480
Notationally a way to say that
is as I've done here, really

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:27.450
what this expression
corresponds to is

00:24:27.450 --> 00:24:31.500
that we started with x of n.

00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:33.960
We formed the periodic
replica of that

00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:35.790
using the modular
notation that we

00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:38.400
introduced at the
beginning of the lecture.

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:43.960
Shift that by two points, and
then extract a single period.

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:46.020
So this is a long way--

00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:48.180
well I guess it's really
a short way of going

00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:49.860
through all these steps.

00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:55.290
But it's the idea and not
the mathematical formalism

00:24:55.290 --> 00:24:56.940
that's important.

00:24:56.940 --> 00:25:01.560
Think of this as a circular
shift of this finite length

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:07.390
sequence inside the interval
0 to capital N minus 1.

00:25:07.390 --> 00:25:07.890
OK.

00:25:07.890 --> 00:25:15.000
So this then is our
shifting property.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:20.740
I've rewritten it in a
slightly different way here,

00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:24.490
corresponding to using the
modular sort of notation.

00:25:24.490 --> 00:25:28.907
That is the statement is that
a circular shift of x of n--

00:25:28.907 --> 00:25:31.240
and that's what all this means
is just simply a circular

00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:33.130
shift--

00:25:33.130 --> 00:25:36.910
has as its discrete
Fourier transform

00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:40.390
the original discrete
Fourier transform multiplied

00:25:40.390 --> 00:25:43.390
by this complex exponential.

00:25:43.390 --> 00:25:45.430
Because of the fact
that we've interpreted

00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:50.770
the discrete Fourier transform
as a finite length sequence,

00:25:50.770 --> 00:25:53.440
we have again a duality
between the time domain

00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:55.330
and the frequency domain.

00:25:55.330 --> 00:25:59.260
In particular, if we
apply a circular shift

00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:03.930
to the discrete Fourier
transform values,

00:26:03.930 --> 00:26:06.240
the resulting finite
length sequence

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:09.540
is the original finite
length sequence multiplied

00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:12.310
by a complex exponential.

00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:16.140
Well, the details of the algebra
involved in working this out

00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:17.760
aren't important right now.

00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:19.950
You'll have plenty
of opportunity

00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:24.780
to look at those at your
leisure in the text,

00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:28.300
also to work some of
this in the study guide.

00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:33.180
The important concept right now,
the important thing to cement,

00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:37.530
is the notion of a circular
shift of a finite length

00:26:37.530 --> 00:26:38.910
sequence.

00:26:38.910 --> 00:26:41.640
And think of it as the
finite length sequence

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:45.570
as it shifts, points that
come outside the interval 0

00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:48.030
to capital N minus
1, wrap around

00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:49.320
and come in on the other side.

00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:55.080
Now we also have
symmetry properties

00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:58.830
for the discrete Fourier
transform, which are basically

00:26:58.830 --> 00:27:01.800
a consequence of the
symmetry properties

00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:05.100
for the discrete Fourier series.

00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:07.230
I'll remind you that
for the discrete Fourier

00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:12.570
series, for a periodic
sequence that's real,

00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:15.390
we had the symmetry
property that

00:27:15.390 --> 00:27:18.840
said that the real part of the
Fourier series coefficients

00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:20.280
are even.

00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:22.540
And we wrote that
in a couple of ways.

00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:26.070
One of which was to
state that x sub R of k

00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:31.320
is equal to x sub R
of capital N minus k.

00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:35.370
And the imaginary part of the
Fourier series coefficients

00:27:35.370 --> 00:27:36.300
are odd.

00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:42.780
That is they're equal to minus
x sub I of capital N minus k.

00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:48.265
Well, the discrete
Fourier transform

00:27:48.265 --> 00:27:51.240
is one period of the
discrete Fourier series.

00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:54.210
And consequently, this
implies the same type

00:27:54.210 --> 00:27:58.740
of symmetry properties for the
discrete Fourier transform,

00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:01.790
keeping in mind again that we
want to relate these properties

00:28:01.790 --> 00:28:04.510
just to a single period.

00:28:04.510 --> 00:28:07.320
So we have the discrete
Fourier transform.

00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:11.050
Again, we'll assume
that x of n is real.

00:28:11.050 --> 00:28:16.090
And the statement then, implied
by simply extracting one period

00:28:16.090 --> 00:28:18.640
out of the discrete
Fourier series,

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:22.660
is that the real part of the
discrete Fourier transform

00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:28.420
coefficients are equal to
one period extracted out

00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:35.860
of the periodic sequence,
which is x sub R of N minus k,

00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:38.170
repeated over and over again.

00:28:38.170 --> 00:28:40.480
Periodically that's what
the modular notation

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:43.300
did for us, one period
extracted out of that

00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:46.750
that's what this rectangular
window does for us.

00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:49.840
And we have a similar
type of statement

00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:51.880
about the imaginary part.

00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:53.470
This is basically
a statement that

00:28:53.470 --> 00:29:00.640
says that the real part is even,
if we interpret even correctly.

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:07.850
And the imaginary part is odd,
if we interpret odd correctly.

00:29:07.850 --> 00:29:10.880
And in particular,
the interpretation

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:13.040
is a little different
than the way

00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:16.850
we've been talking about
even and odd sequences.

00:29:16.850 --> 00:29:19.730
Well, to see what
this expression means,

00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:21.050
it looks a little involved.

00:29:21.050 --> 00:29:22.940
It's got some
modular things in it,

00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:25.790
and multiplying by a
rectangular window.

00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:29.570
But that's mainly
notational formalism.

00:29:29.570 --> 00:29:31.670
And what these two
expressions are saying

00:29:31.670 --> 00:29:34.570
are very straightforward.

00:29:34.570 --> 00:29:40.290
Let's look, for example,
at what this implies for k

00:29:40.290 --> 00:29:45.930
equal to 0 or for k equal to 1.

00:29:45.930 --> 00:29:52.390
For k equal to 0, we have x sub
R of capital N modulo capital

00:29:52.390 --> 00:29:58.140
N, or equivalently up here
we have capital X sub R of 0

00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:06.310
is X sub R of N minus 0 modulo
capital N times R sub N of 0.

00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:09.720
Well, R sub N of 0,
according to the way

00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:14.490
that we've defined this
rectangular window, is unity.

00:30:14.490 --> 00:30:18.400
And what is all this equal to?

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:24.470
Well, it's capital N modulo
capital N, which is 0.

00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:26.530
In other words,
this argument at 0,

00:30:26.530 --> 00:30:29.680
this simply is a
trivial statement

00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:34.180
that says that X Sub R of
0 is equal to X sub R of 0.

00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:38.770
And that really doesn't
tell us too much.

00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:41.500
For k equal to 1, we
add that X sub R of 1

00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:45.810
is X sub R of capital N
minus 1 modulo capital

00:30:45.810 --> 00:30:49.340
N times R sub capital N of 1.

00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:53.200
This again is unity.

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:56.200
And since capital N
minus 1 is in the range 0

00:30:56.200 --> 00:31:00.220
to capital N minus 1
that taken, modulo N

00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:08.480
is just simply X sub R
of capital N minus 1.

00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:13.350
So what this says is X sub R
of 0 is equal to X sub R of 0.

00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:17.780
So as X sub R of 1 is equal
to X sub R of N minus 1.

00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:21.160
And if we repeated this, we'd
find X sub R of 2 equal to X

00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:23.140
sub R of N minus 2.

00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:25.630
And that's in the context
of the discrete Fourier

00:31:25.630 --> 00:31:31.750
transform, what we mean by the
Fourier transform being even.

00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:34.480
So as an example,
here we have what

00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:39.250
can correspond to a real part.

00:31:39.250 --> 00:31:44.400
And we have X sub R of k.

00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:50.665
We have X sub R of 1 equal to
X sub R of capital N minus 1.

00:31:50.665 --> 00:31:59.110
Well, that says that this
value is equal to that value.

00:31:59.110 --> 00:32:03.280
X sub R of 2 equal to
X sub R of N minus 2.

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:08.290
That says that this value
is equal to that value.

00:32:11.090 --> 00:32:14.480
And likewise this value
is equal to this one.

00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:17.720
This one is equal to
that one, et cetera.

00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:21.680
In a similar way, we have
a statement that tells us

00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:27.390
that the imaginary part is
odd in exactly the same sense.

00:32:27.390 --> 00:32:30.140
In other words that
there's a symmetry

00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:35.330
as we look at the imaginary
part coming in from both sides

00:32:35.330 --> 00:32:36.770
of the sequence.

00:32:36.770 --> 00:32:38.600
Incidentally, I've
indicated here

00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:42.950
by a dotted line
what would correspond

00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:48.360
to the periodic extension
of this set of DFT values.

00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:51.500
In other words, this would be
this one repeated over again.

00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:54.710
And if we were thinking of
the discrete Fourier series,

00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:58.280
this would just be
periodic replicas.

00:32:58.280 --> 00:32:59.930
Although in fact,
the discrete Fourier

00:32:59.930 --> 00:33:02.570
transform, since
we've interpreted it

00:33:02.570 --> 00:33:06.530
as a finite length sequence,
the discrete Fourier transform

00:33:06.530 --> 00:33:11.010
would have 0 values
on both ends of this.

00:33:11.010 --> 00:33:11.510
All right.

00:33:11.510 --> 00:33:15.440
So the corresponding symmetry
for the imaginary part

00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:25.180
says that if we look at the
imaginary part at n equals 1,

00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:29.170
then that's equal to minus
the imaginary part at capital

00:33:29.170 --> 00:33:31.480
N minus 1.

00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:34.810
If we look at the imaginary
part at n equals 2,

00:33:34.810 --> 00:33:38.170
then that's equal to
minus the imaginary part

00:33:38.170 --> 00:33:41.600
at capital N minus 2.

00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:45.130
In other words, there
is an antisymmetry

00:33:45.130 --> 00:33:47.680
as we look at the
imaginary part coming

00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:49.510
in from both ends of the period.

00:33:49.510 --> 00:33:52.510
So that's the kind of
evenness and oddness

00:33:52.510 --> 00:33:55.240
that we're talking
about when we talk

00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:58.270
about the symmetry properties
for the discrete Fourier

00:33:58.270 --> 00:33:59.950
transform.

00:33:59.950 --> 00:34:02.920
In other words, it's an
even function in the sense

00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:08.110
that as we come in from the
two ends, we see a symmetry.

00:34:08.110 --> 00:34:09.100
The real part is even.

00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:10.810
The imaginary part
is odd, in the sense

00:34:10.810 --> 00:34:12.670
that we see an antisymmetry.

00:34:12.670 --> 00:34:14.710
As we come in from the
two ends of the period.

00:34:18.270 --> 00:34:19.949
OK.

00:34:19.949 --> 00:34:23.190
That is just a
simple introduction

00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:27.550
to the symmetry properties.

00:34:27.550 --> 00:34:31.060
We have also as we've
talked about with

00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:35.080
our other transforms,
the convolution property.

00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:40.150
And the convolution property
relates very heavily

00:34:40.150 --> 00:34:44.690
to the type of
convolution that we

00:34:44.690 --> 00:34:49.380
were talking about for the
discrete Fourier series.

00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:56.449
What we want to ask is, what
is the sequence, finite length

00:34:56.449 --> 00:35:02.840
sequence x3 of n, whose
discrete Fourier transform is

00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:07.790
the product of the discrete
Fourier transform of x1 of n,

00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:13.110
and the discrete Fourier
transform of x2 of n.

00:35:13.110 --> 00:35:19.350
Well, we know what the sequence
is, the periodic sequence is,

00:35:19.350 --> 00:35:22.380
whose discrete Fourier
series is the product

00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:26.010
of the discrete Fourier series
of the periodic equivalent

00:35:26.010 --> 00:35:31.820
of x1 of n and the periodic
equivalent of x2 of n.

00:35:31.820 --> 00:35:34.520
And this sequence
must just simply

00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:40.280
be one period extracted
from x3 tilde of n.

00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:45.740
In other words, x3 of n is equal
to x3 tilde of n multiplied

00:35:45.740 --> 00:35:49.530
by a rectangular sequence.

00:35:49.530 --> 00:35:55.760
Well, we know how to form
from the last lecture,

00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:59.660
the convolution that
corresponds to multiplying

00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:02.180
the discrete Fourier
series together.

00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:07.560
And that convolution was the
periodic sequences x1 tilde

00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:13.940
of m and x2 tilde of
n minus m, summed over

00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:19.915
one period that is from m
equals 0 to capital N minus 1.

00:36:19.915 --> 00:36:22.380
Well, the finite
length sequence,

00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:25.520
x3 of n that corresponds
to the product of these two

00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:30.020
discrete Fourier
transforms, corresponds then

00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:36.470
to extracting a single period
from this periodic sequence,

00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:42.140
in other words, multiplying
this by R sub capital N of n.

00:36:44.930 --> 00:36:48.140
So this then is the
kind of convolution

00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:51.710
that results from multiplying
the discrete Fourier

00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:56.720
transforms together, or we could
write this in a different way.

00:36:56.720 --> 00:37:00.320
We can express this
periodic sequence

00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:04.790
using our modular notation
in terms of x1 of m,

00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:10.760
as x1 of m taken
modulo capital N.

00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:15.800
And this periodic sequence
is x2 of n minus m

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:19.550
that argument taken
modulo capital N.

00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:23.490
Well, we can take one
additional step here,

00:37:23.490 --> 00:37:26.330
which may or may not be useful.

00:37:26.330 --> 00:37:29.900
Observe that we
only use values of m

00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:33.290
in this expression in
the interval from 0

00:37:33.290 --> 00:37:35.550
to capital N minus 1.

00:37:35.550 --> 00:37:38.330
So in fact, although this
is a periodic sequence,

00:37:38.330 --> 00:37:40.580
we're only using
one period of it.

00:37:40.580 --> 00:37:49.970
So this piece is
equivalently x1 of m.

00:37:49.970 --> 00:37:51.530
And what is this?

00:37:51.530 --> 00:37:56.000
Well, think back to the
kind of circular shifting

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:59.630
that we were talking about doing
with finite length sequences.

00:37:59.630 --> 00:38:02.750
What this basically
corresponds to doing

00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:07.250
is applying not a
linear shift to x2 of n,

00:38:07.250 --> 00:38:10.610
but a circular shift,
flipping x2 and applying

00:38:10.610 --> 00:38:14.180
a circular shift to x2 of n.

00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:16.190
And then of course,
this is just in here

00:38:16.190 --> 00:38:19.670
to allow us to extract
a single period.

00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:22.670
This then corresponds
to what we'll

00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:28.670
refer to as a circular
convolution of this sequence,

00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:33.710
or rather the sequence x1 of n,
and the finite length sequence

00:38:33.710 --> 00:38:35.860
x2 of n.

00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:39.110
It's a circular convolution.

00:38:39.110 --> 00:38:42.960
And notationally we'll
denote that as x1

00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:45.590
of n, circularly
convolved, keeping

00:38:45.590 --> 00:38:49.100
track of what the
circumference of this cylinder

00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:53.270
is that we're wrapping the
finite-length sequences around,

00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:56.660
circularly convolved, an
endpoint circular convolution

00:38:56.660 --> 00:38:59.300
with x2 of n.

00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:02.180
Now, I wouldn't
expect at this point

00:39:02.180 --> 00:39:06.440
that what this circular
convolution is in detail,

00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:09.170
I wouldn't expect
that to be very clear.

00:39:09.170 --> 00:39:11.930
We have some modular
notation in there,

00:39:11.930 --> 00:39:13.500
and we're multiplying by this.

00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:15.830
And there was some periodic
something somewhere,

00:39:15.830 --> 00:39:19.550
and where did we
extract the period.

00:39:19.550 --> 00:39:21.750
A lot of our attention
at this point,

00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:24.710
and in fact through most
of the next lecture,

00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:28.940
is going to be focused on
interpreting and getting

00:39:28.940 --> 00:39:33.290
a feeling for what the
circular convolution means.

00:39:33.290 --> 00:39:35.990
There are lots of
pictures that I'll

00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:39.800
try to suggest to
help in forming

00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:42.980
an idea of circular convolution.

00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:46.790
Let me just offer
one now and show you

00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:52.280
a simple example of circular
convolution, with the notion

00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:55.580
that in the next lecture we'll
be focusing almost entirely

00:39:55.580 --> 00:39:57.410
on what circular
convolution means

00:39:57.410 --> 00:40:01.141
in relation to linear
convolution, et cetera.

00:40:01.141 --> 00:40:01.640
But look.

00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:03.800
Here's what this means.

00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:05.870
First of all, linear
convolution, what do we do?

00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:07.970
We have two sequences.

00:40:07.970 --> 00:40:09.890
They're laid out flat.

00:40:09.890 --> 00:40:14.120
We do a linear convolution by
flipping one of the sequences,

00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:16.820
and then shifting the
two sequences linearly

00:40:16.820 --> 00:40:19.820
with relation to each
other, multiplying

00:40:19.820 --> 00:40:22.700
and adding up the values
from minus infinity

00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:25.100
to plus infinity.

00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:27.500
The circular
convolution basically

00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:32.180
corresponds to wrapping
one of the sequences

00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:35.180
around the circumference
of a cylinder,

00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:38.360
taking the other sequence,
flipping it, wrapping

00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:42.050
that around the circumference
of another cylinder,

00:40:42.050 --> 00:40:45.020
putting the two cylinders
inside each other,

00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:48.920
and then the shifting as
we change the value of n

00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:51.980
can be thought of as
rotating one of the cylinders

00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:57.590
inside the other, multiplying
the sequence values together,

00:40:57.590 --> 00:41:00.860
and then adding that
product around the cylinder.

00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:05.850
That is adding from m equals
0 to capital N minus 1.

00:41:05.850 --> 00:41:08.480
And what this thing
does basically,

00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:11.840
since it extracts one period
of a periodic sequence,

00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:14.990
it corresponds
essentially to just simply

00:41:14.990 --> 00:41:19.550
cutting the cylinder and laying
the answer around flat again.

00:41:19.550 --> 00:41:22.130
That's the notion of
circular convolution,

00:41:22.130 --> 00:41:24.590
and it results from
the fact that we're

00:41:24.590 --> 00:41:28.550
thinking of the arguments
in the convolution taken

00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:31.130
modulo capital N.

00:41:31.130 --> 00:41:35.360
Well, let's just look at a
simple example with the idea

00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:39.540
that as we go on to
the next lecture,

00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:43.460
we'll be concentrating some more
on the interpretation of what

00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:44.990
circular convolution means.

00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:51.480
All right.

00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:56.340
Here we have a sequence x1 of m.

00:41:56.340 --> 00:42:00.900
Remember that in the
circular convolution,

00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:04.320
we're summing over an index m.

00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:07.680
So here we have x1 of m.

00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:10.230
Here we have x2 of m.

00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:18.430
And what we want to form
is x2 of n minus m taken

00:42:18.430 --> 00:42:23.110
modulo capital N.
So first of all,

00:42:23.110 --> 00:42:30.090
here we have x2 of minus
m, modulo capital N.

00:42:30.090 --> 00:42:33.970
And what that corresponds
to is flipping x2 of m,

00:42:33.970 --> 00:42:40.690
flipping it over, and then
repeating it periodically.

00:42:40.690 --> 00:42:44.740
And the periodic replicas
I've designated here

00:42:44.740 --> 00:42:48.130
with dashed lines, so
that we focus completely

00:42:48.130 --> 00:42:53.240
on the interval 0 to
capital N minus 1.

00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:56.050
So in fact, notice that
we could have thought

00:42:56.050 --> 00:43:02.230
of flipping this modulo
capital N by first flipping

00:43:02.230 --> 00:43:04.600
it, and then taking
the values over here,

00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:08.300
and just simply replacing
them on the right-hand side.

00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:12.610
In other words, it's these
values that ended up over here.

00:43:12.610 --> 00:43:15.310
When we flip this sequence,
of course, the value at 0

00:43:15.310 --> 00:43:20.560
stays where it is, and the
rest of those values end

00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:23.905
up again in the range
0 to capital N minus 1,

00:43:23.905 --> 00:43:26.800
but flipped over.

00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:29.590
If we shift this
periodic sequence

00:43:29.590 --> 00:43:36.545
by one value to the left,
then what we have is--

00:43:39.290 --> 00:43:42.230
sorry, shift it by one
value to the right,

00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:46.460
then we end up with
this periodic sequence.

00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:51.032
Again, concentrate on the
range 0 to capital N minus 1,

00:43:51.032 --> 00:43:55.580
and you can see that
that is a circular shift

00:43:55.580 --> 00:44:02.180
of one point of one period
of this periodic sequence.

00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:04.010
In other words,
if you circularly

00:44:04.010 --> 00:44:07.100
shift this to the
right, that point

00:44:07.100 --> 00:44:10.460
comes back in on the other side.

00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:13.490
Here is the same thing shifted.

00:44:13.490 --> 00:44:16.400
Again, another point,
so we can think

00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:19.970
of having taken this one period,
shifting it to the right,

00:44:19.970 --> 00:44:23.390
and this point comes back
in again on the other side.

00:44:23.390 --> 00:44:26.120
Of course, the way we're
really getting it is--

00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:27.680
or another way to
think of it is--

00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:31.400
it's the corresponding value
from the next period over that

00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:32.720
gets shifted in.

00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:35.210
But I'd prefer
now that you begin

00:44:35.210 --> 00:44:40.500
thinking of it as a circular
shift of just that one period.

00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:43.040
So, you can see
that as we continue

00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:47.990
changing the value of
n, then this one period

00:44:47.990 --> 00:44:49.910
gets circularly shifted.

00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:51.590
This value will
end up over here,

00:44:51.590 --> 00:44:55.070
then this value will end
up over here, et cetera.

00:44:55.070 --> 00:44:59.570
Well, if we carry out the
convolution of x1 of m and x2

00:44:59.570 --> 00:45:03.340
of m, for example for
little n equals 1,

00:45:03.340 --> 00:45:06.830
we take this,
multiply it by that,

00:45:06.830 --> 00:45:12.390
and sum up the values in the
range 0 to capital N minus 1.

00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:14.480
Similarly for little
n equals 2, we

00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:17.810
take this and
multiply it by that,

00:45:17.810 --> 00:45:20.120
sum up the values in
the product in the range

00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:23.594
0 to capital N minus 1.

00:45:23.594 --> 00:45:27.320
One thing that you should be
able to see in this example

00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:31.610
is that the answer will
look quite a bit different

00:45:31.610 --> 00:45:34.550
than a linear
convolution of these two,

00:45:34.550 --> 00:45:40.640
because in fact, notice that
we're multiplying always by--

00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:42.260
let's call this amplitude 1.

00:45:42.260 --> 00:45:44.930
We're multiplying always by 1.

00:45:44.930 --> 00:45:49.820
And no matter how we circularly
shifted this one period,

00:45:49.820 --> 00:45:53.820
each value would still get
multiplied by the same amount.

00:45:53.820 --> 00:45:57.440
And consequently, the resulting
values in the convolution

00:45:57.440 --> 00:46:01.940
will be the sum of these values
no matter how much circular

00:46:01.940 --> 00:46:03.710
shifting that we do.

00:46:03.710 --> 00:46:07.670
So that for this particular
example, the convolution

00:46:07.670 --> 00:46:10.460
comes out to look like this.

00:46:10.460 --> 00:46:12.950
That is the values
in the convolution

00:46:12.950 --> 00:46:17.580
are constant over the range
0 to capital N minus 1.

00:46:17.580 --> 00:46:20.630
Then of course, we had this
either cutting the cylinder,

00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:22.520
if you want to look
at it that way,

00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:26.390
or multiplying it by
R sub capital N of n,

00:46:26.390 --> 00:46:30.930
and consequently we get
0 outside that range.

00:46:30.930 --> 00:46:31.430
All right.

00:46:31.430 --> 00:46:34.330
Well, what I would
hope at this point,

00:46:34.330 --> 00:46:37.790
I would certainly
expect that the idea

00:46:37.790 --> 00:46:41.420
of circular convolution
isn't totally clear.

00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:44.090
I would expect that a
little bit of the notion

00:46:44.090 --> 00:46:45.590
is coming out of the haze.

00:46:45.590 --> 00:46:50.840
That is the notion that things
are being shifted circularly

00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:52.760
to implement the convolution.

00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:55.190
That's the kind of
idea that I would hope

00:46:55.190 --> 00:46:57.920
is becoming somewhat clearer.

00:46:57.920 --> 00:47:05.270
And in the next lecture, what
I intend to focus on entirely

00:47:05.270 --> 00:47:09.980
is the additional interpretation
of circular convolution,

00:47:09.980 --> 00:47:13.910
with the hope that by the
end of the next lecture

00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:17.900
the notions of the circular
shifting and the difference

00:47:17.900 --> 00:47:21.770
between circular convolution
and linear convolution

00:47:21.770 --> 00:47:22.680
will be clear.

00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:24.400
Thank you.
