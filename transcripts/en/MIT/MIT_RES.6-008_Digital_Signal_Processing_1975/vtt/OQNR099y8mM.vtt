[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:49.542 --> 00:00:51.500
ALAN OPPENHEIM: Here we
demonstrate the effects

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.390
of sampling and
aliasing by using

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.430
this non-recursive
digital filter.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.500
Where as a digital
filter, it's simply

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.020
set up as an identity system.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.060
But we take
advantage of the fact

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.849
that it has a
sampler for the input

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:08.620
and a de-sampler for the output.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.090
To demonstrate the sampling
and aliasing effect,

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:14.770
we'll use a sinusoidal input.

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.330
And so on the oscilloscope,
what we have are two traces.

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.090
The top trace is
the input sinusoid.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.360
And the bottom trace
is the output sinusoid.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:31.180
And we know that we expect
that as the input sinusoidal

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.900
frequency is increased, the
output sinusoidal frequency

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.820
will likewise increase until we
get into the vicinity of half

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.880
the sampling frequency.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.310
In the vicinity of half the
sampling frequency, because

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.910
of the fact that the low pass
filter is not an ideal low pass

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.000
filter, we have
a beating effect.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.640
And we see the beating
effect evident here.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.110
Now if we were to increase
the input frequency

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.080
past the half the
sampling frequency,

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.470
even though the input
frequency would increase,

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.710
the output frequency would
decrease due to aliasing.

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.400
And let's illustrate that
by first moving back down

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.380
toward DC.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.080
And then using an
automatic sweep,

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.700
to sweep us from DC through
half the sampling frequency up

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.587
to the sampling frequency.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.310
And so here we get
in the vicinity

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.800
of half the sampling frequency.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.510
We see the beating effect.

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.950
Past that, the output
frequency decreases,

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.130
even though the input
frequency is increasing.

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.520
And now, let's illustrate
that once more.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.820
But in this case, let's
listen to the output

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.306
as well as watching the output.

00:02:47.306 --> 00:02:48.740
[HIGH PITCH FREQUENCY]

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:49.696
We hear it increase.

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.218
And then we hear the
output frequency decrease.

00:02:56.218 --> 00:02:58.166
[FREQUENCY STOPS]

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:13.970
What we see here is the impulse
response of the overall system.

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.900
And we observe, for one thing,
that it's a symmetrical impulse

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:18.530
response.

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.170
In other words, corresponds
to a linear phase filter.

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.320
We can also look at
the impulse response

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.820
before the de-sampling
low pass filter.

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.980
Lets take out the de-sampling
low pass filter slowly.

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.000
And what we observe is
basically the output

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.490
of the digital to
analog converter.

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:41.390
Which of course, is a staircase
or boxcar function, not

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:42.740
an impulse train.

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.560
In the real world, the
output of a D to A converter

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.510
generally is a boxcar
type of function.

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.440
We can put the de-sampling
filter back in now.

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.070
And notice that the effect
of the de-sampling filter

00:03:55.070 --> 00:04:01.130
is basically to smooth out
the rough edges in the boxcar

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:02.720
output from D to A converter.

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.910
Now what we'd like to illustrate
is the frequency response

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.280
of the equivalent
continuous time filter.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.730
And we can do that by
sweeping the filter

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:29.590
with a sinusoidal input.

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.070
So what we'll see in
this demonstration is

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.320
on the upper trace, the input
sinusoid, on the lower trace,

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.500
the output sinusoid.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.100
Using a 20 kilohertz sampling
rate and a sweep from 0

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.350
to 10 kilohertz, in
other words, a sweep

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:50.150
from 0 to effectively pi in
terms of the digital filter.

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.930
So what we'll
observe as the input

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.620
frequency increases is
that the output sinusoid

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.310
will have essentially constant
amplitude up to the cutoff

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.520
frequency of the filter,
and then approximately zero

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:04.900
amplitude past.

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.190
So let's now sweep the
filter frequency response.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:17.400
And there is the filter
cutoff frequency.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.660
Now we can also observe the
filter frequency responds

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.650
in several other ways.

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:29.110
One way in which
we can observe it

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.220
is by looking also
at the amplitude

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:37.420
of the output sinusoid as
a function of frequency

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.800
rather than as a
function of time.

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.180
And so we'll observe that
on the left hand scope.

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:44.680
While on the right
hand scope, we'll

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.460
have the same trace that we
just saw, namely two traces.

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:50.860
The upper trace is
the input sinusoid.

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:53.530
The lower trace is
the output sinusoid.

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:57.160
And in addition to observing
the frequency response,

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.310
let's also listen to
the output sinusoid

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:03.820
and observe the
attenuation in the output

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:06.160
as we go from the filter
passband to the filter

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:07.240
stopband.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.490
Again, a 20 kilohertz
sampling rate.

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:12.852
And a sweep range from
0 to 10 kilohertz.

00:06:12.852 --> 00:06:15.262
[HIGH PITCH FREQUENCY]

00:06:20.007 --> 00:06:21.840
Now of course, we're
in the filter stopband.

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:31.000
Now if we increase the sweep
range from 10 kilohertz to 20

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.540
kilohertz so that the sweep
range is equal to the sampling

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:37.330
frequency, in essence
that corresponds

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:41.830
to sweeping out the digital
filter from 0 to 2 pi.

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:44.050
And in that case,
we'll begin to see

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:46.960
some of the periodicity in
the digital filter frequency

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.020
response.

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:52.300
So let's do that now with a
20 kilohertz sampling rate

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:56.338
and a sweep range of
0 to 20 kilohertz.

00:06:56.338 --> 00:06:59.134
[HIGH PITCH FREQUENCY]

00:06:59.134 --> 00:07:07.860
And now we come near 2 pi we
get back into the passband.

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:12.330
And finally back to a 0
to 10 kilohertz sweep, so

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:16.620
that we're again sweeping
only from 0 to pi with regard

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:18.518
to the digital filter.

00:07:18.518 --> 00:07:20.474
[HIGH PITCH FREQUENCY]

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:32.670
OK, now what we would
like to demonstrate

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:35.950
is the effect of changing
the sampling frequency.

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:41.280
And we know that the effective
filter cutoff frequency is

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:44.550
tied to the sampling frequency.

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:47.910
And for this particular
filter, corresponds to a tenth

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:50.100
of the sampling frequency.

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:52.680
Consequently, if we double
the sampling frequency,

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:56.880
we should double the effective
filter passband width

00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:00.120
or double the filter
cutoff frequency.

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:02.460
And so let's do that now.

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:06.960
Again, a 0 to 10 kilohertz
sweep range, but a 40 kilohertz

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:09.870
sampling frequency.

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:11.710
[HIGH PITCH FREQUENCY]

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:16.160
And we should observe that the
filter cutoff frequency has now

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.290
doubled to 4 kilohertz.

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:25.380
Now let's begin to decrease
the filter sampling frequency.

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:28.010
So from 40, let's change
the sampling frequency

00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:30.240
to 20 kilohertz.

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:34.929
We should see the cutoff
frequency cut in half.

00:08:34.929 --> 00:08:37.429
[HIGH PITCH FREQUENCY]

00:08:43.429 --> 00:08:45.070
Now we can go even further.

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:48.010
We can cut the sampling
frequency down to 10 kilohertz.

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:51.150
And remember that the sweep
range is zero to 10 kilohertz.

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:54.660
So now we'll be
sweeping from 0 to 2 pi.

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:56.560
[HIGH PITCH FREQUENCY]

00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:06.650
So as we get close to 2 pi
we'll see the passband again.

00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:11.330
And now let's cut down the
sampling frequency even further

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:14.147
to 5 kilohertz.

00:09:14.147 --> 00:09:16.492
[SHORT HIGH PITCH FREQUENCY]

00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:20.210
Here we are at 2 pi.

00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:22.410
[HIGH PITCH FREQUENCY]

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:24.240
And then at 4 pi.

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:29.390
All right, so that
illustrates the effect

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:31.970
of changing the
sampling frequency.

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:34.460
Now let's conclude
this demonstration

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:37.280
of the effect of the sampling
frequency on the filter cutoff

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:42.200
frequency by carrying out some
filtering on some live audio.

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:48.530
What we'll watch, in this case,
is the output audio waveform

00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:52.370
as a function of time on
the single trace scope.

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:55.610
And also, we'll
listen to the output.

00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:58.850
We'll begin it with a 40
kilohertz sampling rate,

00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:01.790
then reduce that to 20
kilohertz, 10 kilohertz,

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:03.500
and then 5 kilohertz.

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:06.380
And in each of those cases,
the effective filter cutoff

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:10.170
frequency then is cut
in half from 4 kilohertz

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:14.580
to 2 kilohertz to 1 kilohertz
and then to 500 cycles.

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:17.480
So let's begin with a 40
kilohertz sampling frequency,

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:22.559
or an effective filter cutoff
frequency of 4 kilohertz.

00:10:22.559 --> 00:10:27.390
[MUSIC - SCOTT JOPLIN, "MAPLE
 LEAF RAG"]

00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:29.625
Now let's reduce
that to 20 kilohertz

00:10:29.625 --> 00:10:32.630
sampling frequency or
a 2 kilohertz filter.

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:40.400
Then a 10 kilohertz
sampling frequency.

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:48.410
And finally, a 5 kilohertz
sampling frequency

00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:53.120
corresponding to a 500 cycle
equivalent analog filter.

00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:00.040
All right, now let's
finally conclude

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:03.850
by returning to a little
higher quality ragtime

00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:08.820
by changing the sampling
frequency back to 40 kilohertz.
