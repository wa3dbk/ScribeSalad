ERIK DEMAINE: Today we continue
our theme of dynamic graphs.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.410
This is the second
of three lectures.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.390
And this will be the main
lecture about upper bounds

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:32.890
for general graphs.

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.900
Last class was about
link cut trees.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.810
And we saw, essentially,
how to solve

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.655
a problem called dynamic
connectivity, which

00:00:40.655 --> 00:00:42.280
is where you can
insert into lead edges

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.490
and you want to know
what's connected to what.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:46.990
For trees, we solved it.

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.600
We're going to solve it again
for trees in an easier way.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.790
Because we need a slightly
simpler data structure

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:56.260
we can augment in different
ways, called Euler-tour trees.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.800
And then we'll solve
trees, yet again,

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.900
in a setting where you
can only delete edges.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.780
Then we can get from log
n time to constant time.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.560
So we'll still talk about
trees for quite awhile.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.690
But then we'll finally
get to general graphs.

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.570
And we'll do a log squared n
solution for general graphs.

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.110
So just another log
factor more, you

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.484
can generalize from trees
to undirected graphs.

00:01:21.484 --> 00:01:23.650
And then I'll give you a
flavor of what's out there.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.665
Dynamic graphs is a big world.

00:01:25.665 --> 00:01:27.299
It has lots of results.

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.590
And I'll give you some idea
of what other problems have

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.770
been studied in dynamic graphs,
both undirected and directed.

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.960
Though for directed graphs,
things get pretty slow.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.640
Yeah, next class will be
about lower bounds, which

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.830
will prove that this log
stuff is actually necessary,

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:45.959
in case you were wondering.

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:47.500
Because a lot of
the time, we've been

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.620
able to get better
than log in this class.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.040
And dynamic graphs, you can't.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.650
They're log lower bounds.

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.280
So let's start out with a
definition of the problem.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.305
We'll be focusing, today, mostly
on this dynamic connectivity

00:02:00.305 --> 00:02:00.805
problem.

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:19.012
Maintain an undirected
graph subject to [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:19.012 --> 00:02:19.970
insertion and deletion.

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.665
And you can also insert and
delete degree-0 vertices.

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.870
But we're not really going
to worry about vertices.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.110
It's easy to add vertices
that have no edges to them.

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.525
Also easy to delete them.

00:02:39.525 --> 00:02:42.530
It'll be more about adding
and removing edges incident

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.020
to those vertices.

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:53.195
And then the query connectivity
query is given two vertices.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.420
Is there a v to w path?

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.400
So this is asking are
two vertices, v and w,

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.310
in the same connected component?

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.610
That's a strong query.

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.800
In some sense, a weaker query
is just to know globally,

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.930
is the graph connected?

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.260
That's another interpretation
of dynamic connectivity.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.850
It turns out, both
of these problems

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:25.059
are interesting and useful
for solving problems.

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:27.350
But they also turn out to
be, more or less, equivalent.

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:28.849
All the upper bounds
we know for one

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:30.510
apply to the other
and vice versa.

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.380
So it doesn't seem to make much
difference which kind of query

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:34.130
you want.

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:35.790
So might as well take both.

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.100
We'll focus on the v, w query.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.690
OK.

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.200
So that's the
problem, in general.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.490
And I want to introduce
some terminology,

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:53.060
like when we had partially
and full persistence,

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.530
there's also a partial
and full dynamicness.

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.800
A fully dynamic
data structure is

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:05.190
one where you can do inserts
and deletes of edges.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:15.473
And a partially
dynamic data structure

00:04:15.473 --> 00:04:17.264
is one where you can
do inserts or deletes.

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:25.650
So you can only do
inserts, or you can only

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.100
do deletes throughout the
lifetime of the data structure.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.350
And these have specific names.

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.391
Because usually you use
different data structures

00:04:33.391 --> 00:04:35.000
for just insertions
or just deletions.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.972
Just insertions is
called incremental.

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.093
And just deletions is
called decremental.

00:04:49.957 --> 00:04:52.040
The idea of
incremental algorithms

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.900
is definitely not a new one.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.010
But in dynamic graphs,
it always makes sense.

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.590
So in general, a
dynamic graph problem

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.320
is defined usually by insertion
and deletion of edges,

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.500
and either fully dynamic
or partially dynamic.

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.146
And then the query
is what can vary.

00:05:07.146 --> 00:05:09.020
We're going to focus on
connectivity queries.

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:10.850
But you could do others.

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:13.210
So this explains, for
decremental, we're

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.370
going to solve trees
in constant time.

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.040
For fully dynamic, we're
going to solve general graphs

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.040
in log squared n time.

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.095
I guess these three are sort
of the meat of the lecture.

00:05:30.095 --> 00:05:31.470
But before I go
into that, I want

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:34.920
to tell you where this dynamic
connectivity results fit

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:39.158
into the literature in general
on dynamic connectivity.

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:50.046
This is part of our survey, but
just on dynamic connectivity.

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:04.000
Well, for trees, this
is the best we know.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.680
This is the best,
possible really.

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:10.030
You can do log n in general,
and then decremental.

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:16.930
You can do constant.

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:20.200
We actually already know how to
do trees with lint cut trees.

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:23.560
It's not totally obvious,
but you can use links

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:27.010
to simulate edge insertions.

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:30.040
And you can use cuts to
simulate edge deletions.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:33.675
It's not totally obvious
because the link operation

00:06:33.675 --> 00:06:35.050
requires that one
of the vertices

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:37.660
is the root of its tree.

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:40.030
So that's not so trivial.

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:43.720
But we'll see an easy way to
do that in Euler-tour trees

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.610
later on.

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:47.360
So this we kind of
already know how to do.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.490
But we're going to see
another simpler way.

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:52.930
The constant time
amortized decremental

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:55.470
we're going to do today.

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:59.590
So we're also going
to do this today.

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:04.726
Incremental, I don't think it's
known, how to do constant time.

00:07:04.726 --> 00:07:06.100
But I'll tell you
another result.

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:07.630
You can get almost
constant time.

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:12.340
Another special type of
graph you could consider

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:13.450
is a plane graph.

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:15.670
This is a graph with
planar embedding.

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:18.670
So as you're inserting edges
or adding vertices and whatnot,

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:20.412
you say which face they live in.

00:07:20.412 --> 00:07:22.120
And so you have a
fixed planar embedding.

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:24.070
It's being constructed
as you go along.

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:26.590
These are easy to maintain.

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:28.082
You can get order log n.

00:07:28.082 --> 00:07:30.040
I guess, in some sense,
that generalizes trees.

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:33.820
Because they also have pretty
obvious planar embedding.

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:40.750
So that's something
you can do, in log n.

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:47.920
But the big question
is, for general graphs,

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:51.580
can you do log n per operation?

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:55.100
That's an open problem, probably
the central open problem

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:56.914
in dynamic connectivity.

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:09.070
But we're not so
far away from that.

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:11.130
As I said, you can
get log squared.

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:13.110
Let me say what the
log squared result is.

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:15.250
It's a little bit better
than just log squared.

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:18.150
You get log squared
update, but query

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:20.130
is actually sub logarithmic.

00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:26.400
You got a log n over
log log n query.

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:37.000
And another result is
you can do a little bit

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.049
better than log squared.

00:08:38.049 --> 00:08:45.750
You can do log times
log log n cube update.

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:50.470
So roughly log n update, but
there's some poly log log term.

00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:54.280
And query slows
down very slightly.

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:59.310
It becomes log n
over a log log log n.

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:08.060
Well, it'll sort of makes
sense why in a moment.

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:12.580
So the lowest update time known
is this one, log times log

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:14.710
log cubed.

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:21.160
Big open question is whether
you can get log for update,

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:23.160
and any kind of
reasonable query time.

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:26.650
But ideally, log for both.

00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:28.210
So that's for a fully dynamic.

00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:30.490
If I don't say any
otherwise, fully dynamic

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:34.840
is always the default.
Result, that's

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:36.520
the case you usually care about.

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:40.240
Cool.

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:46.990
But if you want
to do incremental,

00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:52.870
you can achieve an alpha bound.

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:55.930
Because incremental dynamic
connectivity is really

00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:58.580
the union find problem.

00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:01.300
Union find, you have a
bunch of sets of elements.

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:03.850
You can take two of them
and union them together.

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:06.040
Once they're unioned, they
can never be split apart.

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:07.570
And find is tell
me what set I'm in.

00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:10.390
So if I do find
on two vertices, I

00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:12.610
can find which connected
components there

00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:15.070
and check whether
they're the same.

00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:17.200
That will give me
connectivity query.

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:19.790
Insertion corresponds to
merging two connected components

00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:21.794
unless they were
already together.

00:10:21.794 --> 00:10:23.960
And it's known you can get
an alpha amortized bound.

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:26.782
And that's optimal
for that problem.

00:10:26.782 --> 00:10:28.240
So I guess that's
actually a theta.

00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:34.100
So that's sort of
well-known stuff.

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:39.250
It's a complicated analysis,
but already been done.

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:42.160
So in particular, that's,
I believe, the best way

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:46.120
we know how to solve incremental
connectivity in trees.

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:50.578
Though I'm curious whether you
can do constant incremental.

00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:59.022
Decremental, there's
essentially a log n solution.

00:10:59.022 --> 00:11:04.120
Not quite, but for dense graphs,
there's a log n solution.

00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:14.740
So I'm stating, instead
of a bound per operation,

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:17.230
this is a total bound.

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:19.150
Let's say you start
with an m-edge graph

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:20.860
and you delete all the edges.

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:24.180
Then you pay log
n for each edge.

00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:27.580
But you also have to pay
this n poly log n cost.

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:31.870
So if m is a bit bigger
than n, then this dominates.

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:33.220
And so it's log n per operation.

00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:34.960
But if you have a
sparse graph, it's

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:37.540
still poly log per operation.

00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:43.652
So decremental, we can kind
of get log for general graphs.

00:11:43.652 --> 00:11:45.610
Another goal you might
have is what if I wanted

00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:47.110
to get worse-case bounds?

00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:49.630
Everything I've said
so far is amortized.

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:51.910
If you want to get worse
case, not much is known.

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:59.290
Big open question is, can I
get a poly log updating query.

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:08.320
So it was actually a pretty big
breakthrough to get poly log

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:09.410
whatsoever.

00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:13.510
This first result
is from 2001 or so,

00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:16.060
after people have worked on
dynamic graphs for probably

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:16.940
a decade.

00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:19.860
So it took quite a while to
find this any kind of poly log.

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:22.030
That still hasn't
been made worse case.

00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:26.350
So the best results
are state of the art

00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:28.570
at the time, before
the poly log came out,

00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:32.800
which is square root of
n update, constant query.

00:12:40.806 --> 00:12:42.920
There's one other result
for worse case, which

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:45.340
is if you want to do an
incremental solution,

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:47.260
so you're just inserting edges.

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.640
Then there's a bound.

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:53.950
It's actually a whole trade off
between updates and queries.

00:12:53.950 --> 00:12:57.430
If you have updates
to take order x time,

00:12:57.430 --> 00:13:01.780
then you get queries that
take log n over log x time.

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:13.490
So log base x of n.

00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:14.450
And that's optimal.

00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:15.140
These are theta.

00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:18.080
There's matching lower bounds.

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:21.770
So this is again,
really union find.

00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:24.420
And so union find has
been well studied,

00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:27.740
even in the worse-case setting.

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:31.570
Can't do as well as
alpha, basically.

00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:32.810
OK.

00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:35.285
And then finally, I want
to talk about lower bounds.

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:47.380
So there are two
complementary results.

00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:50.270
But maybe first I'll
summarize by saying you need

00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:54.300
omega log n update or query.

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:58.320
One of them has to
be at least log n

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:00.303
to do dynamic connectivity.

00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:05.740
As you see, queries
can be sublogarithmic.

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:08.100
We don't know how to make
updates sublogarithmic

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:11.610
and get any
reasonable query time.

00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:15.240
But one of them has
to be at least log.

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:17.580
And here's the specific
theorems that imply that.

00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:38.467
That's actually similar to this
result, but not quite the same.

00:14:38.467 --> 00:14:40.300
Because there's a log
on the left-hand side.

00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:51.670
And these results hold
for amortized solutions.

00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:52.750
Whoops.

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:54.760
Key word's missing here.

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:56.140
This is an update bound.

00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:57.460
And this is a query bound.

00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:04.920
So these are basically
symmetric results.

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:07.980
Says if you have super
logarithmic update,

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:12.120
so you have some x bigger
than 1 times log n update,

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:14.940
then you get log n
over log x query.

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:16.050
That's a lower bound.

00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:18.450
If you have a super
logarithmic query,

00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:20.790
so let's say it's x
times larger than log n,

00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:25.440
then you need at least a log
n over log x update time.

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:30.870
So this result is
the one of relevance.

00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:35.630
Because we don't know any
sublogarithmic updates.

00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:37.240
But we do know
sublogarithmic queries.

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:39.720
So this is the
regime that we have,

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:42.510
essentially, matching
upper bounds.

00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:45.450
Let me show you.

00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:50.670
This result, this
result, and this result,

00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:54.220
even, are, in some sense,
tight against this trade-off,

00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:56.850
this update query trade-off.

00:15:56.850 --> 00:15:59.610
So this update is
log n times log n.

00:15:59.610 --> 00:16:01.260
So x is log n.

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:05.550
And over here we get
log n over log log n.

00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:07.590
So that's tight against that.

00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:11.570
Here, also, we have here
x is log log n cubed.

00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:15.100
So you take a log of log log n
cubed, you get log log log n.

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:17.950
So that's why there's a
log log log n down here.

00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:19.680
That's the best
you could hope for,

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:22.440
given that update time,
that's the best query

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:23.160
time you can get.

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:23.880
Same over here.

00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:28.302
Given an update time of root
n, well, of course, the best

00:16:28.302 --> 00:16:29.760
you can hope for
is constant query.

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:30.960
But indeed, it works out.

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:33.330
As you're taking log n
divided it by 1/2 log n,

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:35.430
you get constant.

00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:40.260
So these results, they
may sound suboptimal.

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:42.030
But a certain sense,
they're optimal.

00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:44.880
Of course, these are just single
points on the trade-off curve.

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:48.535
We still really care
about the situation of--

00:16:48.535 --> 00:16:50.280
where's the open
problem here-- log n

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:54.630
update and query, that
would still be ideal.

00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:57.450
But these are not as bad
as they look, is the point.

00:16:57.450 --> 00:16:59.370
Of course, it'd be better
if this wasn't a 3,

00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:00.740
it was only a 1.

00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:03.210
But they're still,
in a certain sense,

00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:07.540
tight against this, the
query bound that you get.

00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:10.050
Another open problem
here is whether this,

00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:13.230
the reverse situation,
is ever relevant.

00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:17.520
Can you have a
sublogarithmic update time

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:20.716
and get any poly log query time?

00:17:20.716 --> 00:17:22.049
So this is another open problem.

00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:29.240
Little o of log n query.

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:34.290
Sorry, little o of log n update,
and let's say poly log query.

00:17:38.525 --> 00:17:40.900
The lower bound kind of predicts
that something like this

00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:41.720
ought to exist.

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:43.210
But it may be it's
just impossible.

00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:46.978
And there's a different lower
bound that makes it impossible.

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:56.450
Some theta I wanted to add here.

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:04.350
OK.

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:06.390
Another fun thing
about this lower bound,

00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:08.670
is that it holds even if
your graphs are paths.

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:16.840
So in particular, that tells us
that this dynamic tree result

00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:21.570
that we covered last
class, say, you need log n.

00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:23.760
If you're going to do
both operations and log n,

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:26.730
that's optimal.

00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:28.790
Even if your trees
are paths, which

00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:30.570
is like the really easy case.

00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:33.190
And we're going to prove
this theorem next class.

00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:35.970
So if you want, that'll
be our last class,

00:18:35.970 --> 00:18:38.355
our last lower bound.

00:18:38.355 --> 00:18:39.540
That's next time.

00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:40.380
Tune in next time.

00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:43.410
But today we're going to
focus on upper bounds, namely

00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:46.880
these two and this one.

00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:56.532
So let's do them.

00:18:56.532 --> 00:18:58.975
The first one is
Euler-tour trees,

00:18:58.975 --> 00:19:03.180
which is another way
to do the log n bound.

00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:05.430
It's something we need.

00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:09.012
We'll need it for doing
the log squared solution,

00:19:09.012 --> 00:19:10.470
for a reason we'll
see in a moment.

00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:27.680
So Euler-tour tress go back
to 1995, Henzinger and King.

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:31.530
They're simpler dynamic
trees, simpler than link cut,

00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:34.560
even though they're newer.

00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:39.630
And the key difference
compared to link cut trees

00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:42.630
is that they let you
do stuff with subtrees

00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:45.519
of the tree instead
of paths of the tree.

00:19:45.519 --> 00:19:46.560
Link cut trees are great.

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:48.540
We could compute
the min or the max

00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:50.910
or the sum of a bunch
of weights on any path

00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:52.350
that we cared about.

00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:55.680
But for various reasons, we
want to do the same thing

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:56.410
on subtrees.

00:19:56.410 --> 00:19:58.890
And this turns out to be easier.

00:19:58.890 --> 00:20:02.640
So what do we do with
Euler-tour trees?

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:03.930
We take an Euler-tour.

00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:07.845
Remember Euler-tour from-- I
can never remember-- lecture 15.

00:20:07.845 --> 00:20:10.170
[LAUGHS]

00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:13.170
I don't quite remember
what that lecture was.

00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:14.580
When did we do Euler-tours?

00:20:18.164 --> 00:20:19.180
Well, doesn't matter.

00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:20.805
You remember the idea
of an Euler-tour.

00:20:20.805 --> 00:20:23.710
It was just walk around the
tree, do a depth for search,

00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:27.551
and keep track of every
time you visit a node.

00:20:27.551 --> 00:20:29.990
So you visit some
nodes multiple times.

00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:31.820
In general, the
degree of the node

00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:34.190
is the number of
times you visit it.

00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:37.220
Every edge gets
visited exactly twice.

00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:39.530
So it's the linear
number of visits total.

00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:48.360
I just want to take that
linear order of visits,

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:51.840
pull it out straight, store
that in a balanced binary search

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:52.590
tree.

00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:53.590
That's Euler-tour trees.

00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:54.630
They're very simple.

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:10.915
Store the node visits
by the Euler-tour,

00:21:10.915 --> 00:21:13.000
and a balanced
binary search tree.

00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:18.650
What's the order?

00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:21.590
We're storing them
in order by the order

00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:25.800
that the Euler-tour
visits, the visits.

00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:28.250
So this will be the left-most,
the min in the tree.

00:21:28.250 --> 00:21:29.750
This will be the
next and then next.

00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:31.708
So if you do an in-order
traversal of the tree,

00:21:31.708 --> 00:21:34.370
you should get the
visits in this order.

00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:37.400
This is, of course, a way to
balance a tree, in some sense.

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:39.107
I drew a balanced
tree as the thing

00:21:39.107 --> 00:21:40.190
we're trying to represent.

00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:42.800
But again, it could be a
totally unbalanced thing.

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:46.530
But when you do an Euler-tour,
you get order n visits.

00:21:46.530 --> 00:21:48.530
And you throw them into
a balanced binary search

00:21:48.530 --> 00:21:51.261
tree, it's balanced, of course.

00:21:51.261 --> 00:21:53.510
It's a bit of a weird thing,
because you're not really

00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:56.530
preserving the structure
in an obvious way.

00:21:56.530 --> 00:21:59.570
But there's one
more thing we store,

00:21:59.570 --> 00:22:02.960
which will let us do,
essentially, whatever we want.

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:12.730
Each node stores two
pointers into this structure

00:22:12.730 --> 00:22:15.740
to the first and last visit.

00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:24.200
So like this node has a
pointer to its first visit

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:27.980
and its last visit
along this structure.

00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:29.907
It doesn't keep track
of any middle visits.

00:22:29.907 --> 00:22:31.490
Because there could
be a lot of those.

00:22:31.490 --> 00:22:33.410
And we just want to have a
constant number of pointers.

00:22:33.410 --> 00:22:35.000
This is going to be a pointer
machine data structure

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.150
just like link cut trees.

00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:41.090
Let's see.

00:22:41.090 --> 00:22:43.760
How do we solve our operations,
inserting and deleting

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:45.770
of edges and connectivity?

00:22:45.770 --> 00:22:47.690
Actually, I'll start
with just phrasing it

00:22:47.690 --> 00:22:48.560
like link cut trees.

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:51.380
We can do most of the
link cut tree operations.

00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:53.899
Remember, there was a
find root, link and cut

00:22:53.899 --> 00:22:54.940
were our main operations.

00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:56.065
Than there was aggregation.

00:22:56.065 --> 00:22:57.785
But that will have to change.

00:22:57.785 --> 00:22:59.380
But if we want to do find root--

00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:05.910
so we're given one of these
balanced binary search trees.

00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:10.640
In it is the node v.
Well, actually, it's

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:13.560
a little weirder here.

00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:17.240
But we have some
node v in our tree.

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:19.980
And really, we have
our pointers into this.

00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:23.222
This is a balanced
binary search tree here.

00:23:23.222 --> 00:23:25.430
We have pointers to the
first and last visit in here.

00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:25.971
I don't care.

00:23:25.971 --> 00:23:27.640
Just take any visit,
anything in here,

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:32.150
just say the first visit of
v. Then walk up the tree.

00:23:32.150 --> 00:23:36.740
Then walk down the
tree on the left spine.

00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:38.600
That is the min.

00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:43.400
And that's going to be the
first visit of the root node.

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:47.570
And so this has a pointer,
in turn, to the root node.

00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:50.120
Boom, you found the
root of your tree.

00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:53.070
Again, we're maintaining
forest of trees.

00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:55.520
And so we just need to
find which tree v is in,

00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:57.200
walk up, walk down,
that's order log

00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:59.450
n, because this
thing is balanced,

00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:01.220
and we found the root.

00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:03.500
So that's easy.

00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:06.380
Turns out, the other
operations are not too easy

00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:10.430
if you can split and
concatenate your tree.

00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:11.480
So let's start with cut.

00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:17.420
We need a bigger diagram.

00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:33.760
So here's v. Here's the
parent of v. I'll call it w.

00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:34.840
Here's the edge.

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:39.790
And our goal, and
the cut operation

00:24:39.790 --> 00:24:45.890
is to delete that edge, separate
this tree from that tree.

00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:50.680
So what I need to do is
isolate this subtree of v.

00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:53.330
But conveniently, if you
think of the Euler-tour,

00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:56.050
the Euler-tour, it
does some stuff here.

00:24:56.050 --> 00:24:57.910
Eventually it follows this edge.

00:24:57.910 --> 00:25:00.700
Visits v for the
first time here.

00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:02.890
Then it visits all
the stuff down here.

00:25:02.890 --> 00:25:05.360
Then it visits v
for the last time.

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:07.990
Then it follows this edge
and then does other stuff.

00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:13.060
So the v subtree is a contiguous
interval of the Euler-tour.

00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:17.560
So we just cut it
open, cut it apart.

00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:22.450
So we split the BST at
the first and last visits

00:25:22.450 --> 00:25:29.110
to v, which is
exactly what we know.

00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:33.340
We have a pointer from v to
its first and last visits

00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:34.450
in the Euler-tour.

00:25:34.450 --> 00:25:35.520
So split the tree there.

00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:36.430
Split the tree there.

00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:38.800
You know split in a
binary search tree.

00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:43.420
You're given a particular
key value, let's say, x.

00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:47.050
And you split into
everything less than x,

00:25:47.050 --> 00:25:49.810
and everything great than
or equal to x, or something

00:25:49.810 --> 00:25:51.289
like that.

00:25:51.289 --> 00:25:52.330
That's a split operation.

00:25:52.330 --> 00:25:54.250
It can be done in
log n time, and pick

00:25:54.250 --> 00:25:56.350
your favorite balanced
binary search tree.

00:25:56.350 --> 00:25:58.150
Red-black trees, AVL
trees, they can all

00:25:58.150 --> 00:26:00.392
do this and maintain
balance in these two things.

00:26:00.392 --> 00:26:02.350
Even though they might
be very different sizes,

00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:07.612
they'll both be log height
relative to their own size.

00:26:07.612 --> 00:26:09.070
This is obviously
not quite enough.

00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:11.020
Because what we've
done is basically

00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:12.760
cut here and cut here.

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:14.650
Now we have three trees.

00:26:14.650 --> 00:26:18.250
We have the one we want
for v, v is subtree.

00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:20.950
That will correspond
to the Euler-tour

00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:22.360
of exactly that thing.

00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:24.730
So this is the represented
tree I'm talking about.

00:26:24.730 --> 00:26:28.990
And this is the balanced
binary search tree.

00:26:28.990 --> 00:26:31.400
But the rest of the
tree is in two parts.

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:33.490
There's the part
to the left of v,

00:26:33.490 --> 00:26:35.540
before we visited v, the
part after we visited

00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:37.570
v. Those we just have
to stick back together,

00:26:37.570 --> 00:26:38.620
so we concatenate them.

00:26:43.451 --> 00:26:43.950
Yeah.

00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:54.639
So I'll call them the before-v
tree and the after-v tree.

00:26:54.639 --> 00:26:56.930
There is actually a tiny
thing that has to happen here,

00:26:56.930 --> 00:26:58.070
which I just remembered.

00:26:58.070 --> 00:27:04.950
Which is we need, somewhere,
to delete one occurrence of w,

00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:07.130
of the parent of v.

00:27:07.130 --> 00:27:10.142
Because it used to be we
visit w, then we visit v,

00:27:10.142 --> 00:27:10.850
blah, blah, blah.

00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:12.080
Then we visit w again.

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:14.030
If we cut out this
part, we're going

00:27:14.030 --> 00:27:15.620
to have two visits
to w in a row.

00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:17.100
We really just want one visit.

00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:20.980
So this is a minor thing, but
we need to do a delete in there.

00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:22.990
So each of these is log n time.

00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:24.750
So the overall time is log n.

00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:25.400
Easy.

00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:31.060
This is a cut-and-paste kind
of argument, all pretty cheap.

00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:33.140
OK, now let's do link.

00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:40.140
Concatenate is the reverse
of split, by the way.

00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:41.790
You have two trees.

00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:43.650
All the things in
the left are smaller

00:27:43.650 --> 00:27:44.858
than all things in the right.

00:27:44.858 --> 00:27:47.430
You just want to
join them together

00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:51.060
like a very restrictive
kind of merge.

00:27:51.060 --> 00:28:00.450
So join, recall, is you have a
node v. And you want to make it

00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:02.414
a new child of w.

00:28:02.414 --> 00:28:05.350
w might have other children.

00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:09.060
It lives in some bigger tree.

00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:11.120
We want to add v
as a child of w.

00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:13.260
So we're assuming here
v is a root, for now.

00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:16.710
So what do we do?

00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:21.750
Sort of the same thing.

00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:25.260
We sort of know we want to
put v in here somewhere.

00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:27.690
It actually doesn't really
matter where we put it.

00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:30.750
We're not keeping track of
the order of nodes in here.

00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:33.060
So I'm going to simplify
my life and say,

00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:35.550
let's put v at the end.

00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:41.370
I want to make v the last
child of w, like this.

00:28:41.370 --> 00:28:45.009
So we can find the last
child, in some sense.

00:28:45.009 --> 00:28:46.800
After we visit the last
child, we come back

00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:49.170
and do the last visit to w.

00:28:49.170 --> 00:28:51.120
So I'm going to look
at the last visit of w,

00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:54.400
cut the tree open there,
and stick this part in.

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:56.880
Cut the Euler-tour
in half there.

00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:57.540
So split.

00:29:01.270 --> 00:29:07.550
w is tree at w's last visit.

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:14.140
Right?

00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:17.780
And then we do
omega concatenate.

00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:23.020
We're going to
concatenate, basically,

00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:25.960
before w's last visit.

00:29:31.370 --> 00:29:35.370
We're going to concatenate
a single occurrence of w.

00:29:35.370 --> 00:29:37.120
Because there's a new
occurrence of w now.

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:39.130
We do it before and after v.

00:29:39.130 --> 00:29:40.640
So we add another w.

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:46.660
Then we add v's
Euler-tour, v's BST,

00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:50.590
and then we do after
whatever used to be there

00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:54.160
after w's last visit.

00:29:54.160 --> 00:30:02.930
Let's say, after and
including that w visit.

00:30:05.690 --> 00:30:07.730
So just the symmetric
of this, here

00:30:07.730 --> 00:30:09.620
we had to delete
one occurrence of w.

00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:11.480
Here we have to add one back in.

00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:13.430
But you just cut, paste
in the thing you need,

00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:14.970
and rejoin everything.

00:30:14.970 --> 00:30:16.456
So again, very easy.

00:30:16.456 --> 00:30:18.455
It's a constant number
of log n time operations,

00:30:18.455 --> 00:30:22.830
if you can do split and
concatenate in log n time.

00:30:22.830 --> 00:30:26.060
So you see this, it's like wow,
why do we spend so much time

00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:27.470
with link cut trees?

00:30:27.470 --> 00:30:29.159
This is really easy.

00:30:29.159 --> 00:30:30.950
But they have their
different applications.

00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:32.630
If you want to compute
aggregates on paths

00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:33.921
you need to use link cut tress.

00:30:33.921 --> 00:30:35.270
It's the best we know.

00:30:35.270 --> 00:30:37.430
This structure will not
do aggregates on paths.

00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:39.920
But it will do
aggregates on subtrees.

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:42.680
Because subtrees are
represented by these intervals

00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:43.730
in the Euler-tour tree.

00:30:43.730 --> 00:30:46.180
So if you have a weight
on all the nodes in here,

00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:49.926
say, you can easily
find this interval

00:30:49.926 --> 00:30:51.050
and do a range query there.

00:30:51.050 --> 00:30:52.716
So you take the min
of all those things.

00:30:52.716 --> 00:30:55.490
If you have subtree
mins, you can

00:30:55.490 --> 00:30:59.210
take the min of log n
things and in log n time,

00:30:59.210 --> 00:31:02.840
compute the min in an
interval, or min over

00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:06.800
a subtree rooted at a node,
or max or sum, or whatever.

00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:09.820
So here you can do subtree
aggregation in log n time.

00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:13.370
And we're going to need that
for the log squared solution.

00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:20.990
One other thing I
wanted to maybe mention,

00:31:20.990 --> 00:31:21.890
here we did join.

00:31:21.890 --> 00:31:26.300
And join assumed that v
was the root of its tree.

00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:27.890
What if v is not
the root of its tree

00:31:27.890 --> 00:31:29.570
and we still want
to insert an edge?

00:31:29.570 --> 00:31:32.150
Because insert, when
we're maintaining

00:31:32.150 --> 00:31:35.440
an undirected graph,
there is no rootedness.

00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:37.377
That rootedness is just a tool.

00:31:37.377 --> 00:31:39.710
You could say at the first
step here, just root the tree

00:31:39.710 --> 00:31:43.520
somewhere so that we can
have a well-defined beginning

00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:44.774
and end to the Euler-tour.

00:31:44.774 --> 00:31:46.940
Of course, Euler-tour in
it's the most natural form,

00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:48.680
is actually a cycle.

00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:50.330
And it would only
have one visit here.

00:31:53.150 --> 00:31:54.800
So you can think of it that way.

00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:57.470
I'd still like to have the
two visits conceptually,

00:31:57.470 --> 00:32:02.240
because that makes even the
subtree rooted at the root

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:06.110
an interval between the
beginning and the end.

00:32:06.110 --> 00:32:07.940
But the nice thing
of the cycle view

00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:09.900
is if I wanted to
change who the root is,

00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:14.480
say I want this node to
be the root, that's just

00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:15.799
a cyclic shift of everything.

00:32:15.799 --> 00:32:18.340
It just means I want to start
the cycle here and end it here.

00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:24.390
So I'd basically duplicate this
copy of the vertex, singlify

00:32:24.390 --> 00:32:25.244
this one.

00:32:25.244 --> 00:32:26.160
There's only one copy.

00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:28.490
That's the constant number
of inserts and deletes.

00:32:28.490 --> 00:32:29.660
And now rotate.

00:32:29.660 --> 00:32:31.280
[LAUGHS]

00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:32.380
What does it rotate mean?

00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:34.680
Well, before it was
a sequential order,

00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:36.950
starting here, ending here.

00:32:36.950 --> 00:32:39.150
Now, I want it to be a
sequential order, say,

00:32:39.150 --> 00:32:44.200
starting here, continuing this
way, and then ending back here.

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:46.330
So if you look at what
that requires, maybe

00:32:46.330 --> 00:32:50.060
use another color,
I want this part.

00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:58.810
That's an interval of the old
tree, of the old sequence.

00:32:58.810 --> 00:33:01.970
And then I want this part.

00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:04.270
So there's two pieces
of the old tree.

00:33:04.270 --> 00:33:06.590
And I just want to
change their order.

00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:07.450
It's a cyclic shift.

00:33:07.450 --> 00:33:11.780
Cyclic shift is just a cut and
then a rejoin the other way.

00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:15.050
So I can reroute a tree
in log n time as well.

00:33:15.050 --> 00:33:19.280
So this is why, in this world,
join is equivalent to insert.

00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:20.890
If I want to do
a general insert,

00:33:20.890 --> 00:33:22.640
first I reroute v's tree.

00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:25.720
I do a cyclic shift with
one split one concatenate,

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:26.650
like this.

00:33:26.650 --> 00:33:28.120
And I get v to be the root.

00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:30.560
Then I can do the join.

00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:33.710
So again, constant number
of splits and concatenates.

00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:42.280
So it's another operation
we can do, in log in.

00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:44.336
Everything here is log n.

00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:49.140
Cool.

00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:51.840
Any questions about
Euler-tour trees.

00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:54.180
That's all I'll say about them.

00:33:54.180 --> 00:34:01.596
We will next move
on to next result.

00:34:01.596 --> 00:34:03.554
AUDIENCE: Can link cut
trees also do a reroute?

00:34:03.554 --> 00:34:06.010
ERIK DEMAINE: Can link cut
tress also do a reroute?

00:34:06.010 --> 00:34:07.270
I haven't thought about that.

00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:12.684
I would guess so.

00:34:12.684 --> 00:34:14.567
[LAUGHS]

00:34:14.567 --> 00:34:16.400
But it's going to require
some more thought.

00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:21.070
So let's see, link cut tree,
we can do a little aside here.

00:34:21.070 --> 00:34:24.070
Link cut tree, we
do an axis on v.

00:34:24.070 --> 00:34:27.130
So now we get that v is
up here, right at the root

00:34:27.130 --> 00:34:29.124
of the tree of oxx trees.

00:34:29.124 --> 00:34:31.540
Now we've got other trees of
[INAUDIBLE] trees hanging off

00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:33.159
here.

00:34:33.159 --> 00:34:35.664
But in particular, this
thing represents a path.

00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:41.860
It represents the
route to v path.

00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:43.389
It actually has no right child.

00:34:43.389 --> 00:34:48.460
So it's a little bit
emptier, like that.

00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:51.257
So now we want to flip things
around and say v is the root.

00:34:51.257 --> 00:34:52.840
We basically want
to reverse the order

00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:55.090
of all the nodes in this tree.

00:34:55.090 --> 00:34:57.760
So reversing the order of
nodes in a binary search tree,

00:34:57.760 --> 00:34:59.860
you can't regularly do.

00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:03.160
But if you augment your
data structure to say,

00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:06.250
I could basically mark
these nodes as all inverted,

00:35:06.250 --> 00:35:07.880
treat left as right
and right as left.

00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:10.180
It's basically the
dyslexic approach.

00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:13.570
You have a bit
saying from here down

00:35:13.570 --> 00:35:16.540
to here, mark
everything as dyslexic.

00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:18.032
And so you invert
left and right.

00:35:18.032 --> 00:35:19.990
So I think, with this
appropriate augmentation,

00:35:19.990 --> 00:35:25.200
you can reroute the
tree in log n time.

00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:28.200
But of course, there's
some details to check.

00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:30.700
It might even be that's in the
original link cut tree paper.

00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:32.170
But I don't remember offhand.

00:35:32.170 --> 00:35:34.449
So I'm pretty sure it
works, and therefore,

00:35:34.449 --> 00:35:35.740
gives you dynamic connectivity.

00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:37.656
But if it doesn't,
Euler-tour trees do it too.

00:35:37.656 --> 00:35:41.170
So we're covered either way.

00:35:41.170 --> 00:35:42.460
So that's Euler-tour trees.

00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:45.782
Next on our list is decremental
connectivity in trees.

00:35:45.782 --> 00:35:47.740
So we're going to solve
a weaker problem, which

00:35:47.740 --> 00:35:51.384
is just deletions only instead
of inserts and deletes.

00:35:51.384 --> 00:35:52.675
We're going to solve it faster.

00:35:55.300 --> 00:35:58.450
Constant time per operation.

00:35:58.450 --> 00:36:16.650
This is just a
fun little result.

00:36:16.650 --> 00:36:21.270
It's fun because it uses
some techniques we know.

00:36:21.270 --> 00:36:27.300
So bound is constant amortized,
assuming all edges get deleted.

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:36.780
We need to assume
this, essentially,

00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:39.460
because we're amortizing
against the future.

00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:43.710
So we need to get all
the way to the end.

00:36:43.710 --> 00:36:46.410
Overall, over n operations it's
going to take order n time.

00:36:49.050 --> 00:36:51.290
This is, again, a
series of refinements,

00:36:51.290 --> 00:36:53.520
or a bunch of pieces of
the solution that get

00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:57.540
combined together, not
a sequential algorithm.

00:36:57.540 --> 00:37:01.200
So the first observation is, of
course, we can do order log n.

00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:04.350
We know, now, maybe
two ways to do it.

00:37:04.350 --> 00:37:08.337
But you can use Euler-tour trees
and only do cuts, life is easy.

00:37:08.337 --> 00:37:10.170
Link cut trees, you
could also just do cuts.

00:37:10.170 --> 00:37:11.980
You don't even need rerouting.

00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:14.790
Rerouting was only for joins.

00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:16.060
So that may seem obvious.

00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:21.140
But how do we reduce
the log n to a constant?

00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:23.510
In general, in this class?

00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:24.935
AUDIENCE: Make up tables.

00:37:24.935 --> 00:37:27.650
ERIK DEMAINE: Indirection,
and maybe look up tables.

00:37:27.650 --> 00:37:28.440
Yep.

00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:31.858
How do we do
indirection in a tree?

00:37:31.858 --> 00:37:33.184
AUDIENCE: Leaf pruning?

00:37:33.184 --> 00:37:35.850
ERIK DEMAINE: Leaf
pruning, leaf trimming,

00:37:35.850 --> 00:37:37.540
whatever you want to call it.

00:37:37.540 --> 00:37:41.730
Should call it the Edward
Scissorhands approach,

00:37:41.730 --> 00:37:43.380
or something.

00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:45.420
So leaf trimming,
what I want to do

00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:51.540
is cut below
maximally deep nodes

00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:52.890
that are [INAUDIBLE] log n.

00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:04.536
Say with greater than
log n descendants.

00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:12.600
So we have our top tree.

00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:14.257
And then hanging
off some nodes here,

00:38:14.257 --> 00:38:15.840
we're going to have
some bottom trees.

00:38:23.150 --> 00:38:26.840
These each have, at
most, log n nodes.

00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:30.227
These have bigger than
log n nodes below them.

00:38:30.227 --> 00:38:32.060
So we can charge every
leaf in the structure

00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:34.950
to the log n nodes below it.

00:38:34.950 --> 00:38:42.320
And so up here we have at most,
sorry, n over log n leaves.

00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:43.580
Not nodes.

00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:46.610
Nodes could still be linear
if the graph is a path.

00:38:46.610 --> 00:38:49.850
But at most, n
over log n leaves.

00:38:49.850 --> 00:38:53.750
So we have, at most, n over
log n branching nodes up here.

00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:56.300
So what we need is a
structure for dealing

00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:59.120
with long paths in
the top, a structure

00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:02.180
for dealing with log n
size things down here,

00:39:02.180 --> 00:39:06.390
and a structure for
combining the paths together.

00:39:06.390 --> 00:39:09.620
And that's the easy part.

00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:12.080
If we treat each long
path as a single edge,

00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:15.056
basically, we look at
the compressed top tree,

00:39:15.056 --> 00:39:16.430
in the sense of
compressed tries.

00:39:16.430 --> 00:39:17.840
But it's now a tree
instead of a try.

00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:18.650
I guess it's a try.

00:39:18.650 --> 00:39:20.026
Whatever

00:39:20.026 --> 00:39:21.650
We look at the
compressed tree up here.

00:39:21.650 --> 00:39:23.780
That will have
size, n over log n.

00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:27.300
And then we can afford
to use structure one.

00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:27.800
Why?

00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:30.290
Because in some
sense, there only

00:39:30.290 --> 00:39:32.762
be n over log n
operations performed.

00:39:32.762 --> 00:39:34.970
So it's not a space issue
there we're trying to save.

00:39:34.970 --> 00:39:35.760
It's a time issue.

00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:37.260
So a little different
from the past.

00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:42.110
There are only n
over log n times

00:39:42.110 --> 00:39:43.640
that you can destroy
a path up here.

00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:45.667
Because there's only
n over log n paths.

00:39:45.667 --> 00:39:48.000
Each time you destroy a path,
I do an operation up here,

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:49.030
I pay log n.

00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:51.950
But if the total number of
operations n over log n,

00:39:51.950 --> 00:39:53.120
total cost is linear.

00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:56.670
So constant amortized
against the future.

00:39:56.670 --> 00:40:03.040
So I'm going to use structure
one on the compressed top tree.

00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:11.820
And what remains is what
I do in the bottom trees?

00:40:11.820 --> 00:40:13.050
What I do on the paths?

00:40:13.050 --> 00:40:15.297
And then how do I combine
all those results together?

00:40:15.297 --> 00:40:17.380
Let's first talk about how
to combine the results.

00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:19.650
There are a couple
of different cases.

00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:23.220
It So we're doing
a query on v, w,

00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:24.990
and we want to do
connectivity query.

00:40:27.630 --> 00:40:32.940
So it could be that v and w
are in the same bottom tree.

00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:37.860
In that case, we just need to
do a query within a bottom tree.

00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:42.540
So as long as we can solve
the bottom tree case quickly,

00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:43.650
we're happy.

00:40:43.650 --> 00:40:45.960
Constant time, I guess.

00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:49.700
That will turn out
to be pretty easy.

00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:51.990
That's the easy case.

00:40:51.990 --> 00:40:55.260
Otherwise they could be
in different bottom trees.

00:40:55.260 --> 00:41:02.430
So it could be v's down here and
w's in some other bottom tree.

00:41:02.430 --> 00:41:05.080
So then we have three
queries we need to do.

00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:06.570
One is like this.

00:41:06.570 --> 00:41:08.700
One is like this.

00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:11.880
We need to test the single
edge, but that's trivial.

00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:14.660
And then we need to
do a query in the top.

00:41:14.660 --> 00:41:16.300
Can you get from here to here?

00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:18.500
Now, these nodes are
a little bit special,

00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:19.500
because they are leaves.

00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:22.710
They will be at
the ends of paths.

00:41:22.710 --> 00:41:26.550
So this is really just a query
we can do using structure one.

00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:32.610
Because we take either an
entire path or no path at all.

00:41:32.610 --> 00:41:34.650
So we can look at
the compressed tree

00:41:34.650 --> 00:41:36.390
and that's enough,
because the leaves

00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:38.180
exist on the compressed tree.

00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:39.430
That's not always the case.

00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:42.390
A different situation is this.

00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:45.860
We might have, for example,
v up here, w up here,

00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:48.760
and v and w are not down here.

00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:50.200
So these are irrelevant.

00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:53.304
We just want to know, in the
top tree, can I get from v to w?

00:41:53.304 --> 00:41:54.720
Now, this is a
little more awkward

00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:58.380
because v is going
to live on some path.

00:41:58.380 --> 00:41:59.790
w is going to live on some path.

00:41:59.790 --> 00:42:02.220
But it might be in
the middle of a path.

00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:04.330
And so there's now three
queries we need to do.

00:42:04.330 --> 00:42:08.160
One is can I get to
the top of my path?

00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:11.290
And then can I get from
one path to the other?

00:42:11.290 --> 00:42:12.837
So these are
branching nodes here.

00:42:12.837 --> 00:42:14.420
And can I get from
this branching node

00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:15.330
to that branching node?

00:42:15.330 --> 00:42:16.500
It might not always be going up.

00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:17.750
Sometimes you have to go down.

00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:21.590
But point is, a constant number
of queries to path structures,

00:42:21.590 --> 00:42:22.830
to compressed structures.

00:42:22.830 --> 00:42:24.900
This is, again,
the one structure.

00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:28.596
And a constant number of
calls to a bottom structure

00:42:28.596 --> 00:42:29.970
will suffice to
answer the query.

00:42:29.970 --> 00:42:32.220
There's a few more cases
that I haven't drawn.

00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:35.406
If you could be half of
this and half of this.

00:42:35.406 --> 00:42:37.260
But it can all be
done, as long as we

00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:39.300
can solve bottom and paths.

00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:42.540
So let's solve paths
first, I think.

00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:45.900
Oh no, bottom trees, fine.

00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:49.260
So part 3 of the solution
is solve a bottom tree.

00:42:52.170 --> 00:42:54.210
Here we can do it in
constant worse case.

00:42:58.530 --> 00:43:01.740
So this is essentially
the lookup table thing,

00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:03.810
although it's a pretty
simple lookup table.

00:43:03.810 --> 00:43:08.860
What we do, bottom tree
has only log n nodes.

00:43:08.860 --> 00:43:12.480
So we can represent 1 bit
per node in a single word.

00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:18.930
And what we'll do, store
bit vector of which

00:43:18.930 --> 00:43:23.380
edges have been deleted.

00:43:27.750 --> 00:43:28.650
In what order?

00:43:28.650 --> 00:43:29.490
I don't really care.

00:43:29.490 --> 00:43:33.810
Just pick some fixed order
on the edges down here,

00:43:33.810 --> 00:43:35.790
and store the bits
in that order.

00:43:35.790 --> 00:43:37.840
And say every edge
knows its sequence.

00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:40.760
So you could do a depth first
search at the beginning,

00:43:40.760 --> 00:43:44.140
to label the edges in
some canonical order.

00:43:44.140 --> 00:43:46.440
And then every edge knows
what its bit position

00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:47.230
is in the vector.

00:43:47.230 --> 00:43:49.470
So when I go to
delete an edge, I just

00:43:49.470 --> 00:43:53.740
set that one bit
using an or operation.

00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:54.450
Cool.

00:43:54.450 --> 00:43:55.620
So I can delete edges.

00:43:55.620 --> 00:43:59.190
I can actually even insert edges
down here that used to exist.

00:43:59.190 --> 00:44:00.657
I could undelete an edge.

00:44:00.657 --> 00:44:02.490
But that only works in
the bottom structure.

00:44:02.490 --> 00:44:04.850
So not generally useful.

00:44:04.850 --> 00:44:07.510
OK, so it's clear how to do
an update, how to do a delete.

00:44:07.510 --> 00:44:08.730
I just mark a bit.

00:44:08.730 --> 00:44:10.212
How do I do a query?

00:44:10.212 --> 00:44:12.420
I want to know, given two
nodes, v and w, one of them

00:44:12.420 --> 00:44:14.250
could be the root of the tree.

00:44:14.250 --> 00:44:16.560
I want to know can
I get from v to w?

00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:19.340
Or there's only a single
path that might exist.

00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:24.460
So it's a matter of has any edge
along this path been deleted?

00:44:24.460 --> 00:44:32.580
So a general way to
write that is I have w.

00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:34.980
I look at v's path to the root.

00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:36.840
I look at w's path to the root.

00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:39.450
At some point,
we've reach the LCA.

00:44:39.450 --> 00:44:42.890
What I want to know is, have
any of these edges been deleted?

00:44:42.890 --> 00:44:44.160
If yes, I can't get there.

00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:45.780
If none of them have been
deleted, I can get there.

00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:46.950
It's an if and only if.

00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:49.980
I don't care about these
edges up here above the LCA.

00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:53.170
Because I only need to go
to the LCA and back down.

00:44:53.170 --> 00:44:55.170
So what do I do?

00:44:55.170 --> 00:45:07.916
Each vertex stores a bit
vector of its ancestors,

00:45:07.916 --> 00:45:09.750
of the ancestor edges.

00:45:17.740 --> 00:45:21.930
Well, ancestor edges
is kind of weird.

00:45:21.930 --> 00:45:26.790
It stores a bit vector
representing its path

00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:27.290
to the root.

00:45:31.372 --> 00:45:32.700
That's this red stuff.

00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:34.890
I want to know,
for vertex v, what

00:45:34.890 --> 00:45:38.760
are the edges along the path to
the root of this bottom tree?

00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:39.510
Just preprocessed.

00:45:39.510 --> 00:45:41.884
You can build this thing as
you do the depth first search

00:45:41.884 --> 00:45:42.570
and store it.

00:45:42.570 --> 00:45:45.220
Again, it's one word per vertex.

00:45:45.220 --> 00:45:48.962
So I can fit it
with constant space.

00:45:48.962 --> 00:45:50.880
It's constant space overhead.

00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:52.920
And now, if I have
two vertices, I

00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:55.950
take the XOR of those two paths.

00:45:55.950 --> 00:45:58.470
That will give me this part.

00:45:58.470 --> 00:46:03.250
And then I use that as a mask
into the bit vector, say,

00:46:03.250 --> 00:46:04.677
are any of these 1?

00:46:04.677 --> 00:46:05.385
How do I do that?

00:46:05.385 --> 00:46:06.420
I just mask.

00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:09.780
And if the result is the 0 word,
then I know none of them are 1.

00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:14.080
Otherwise, I know some edge
was deleted and I'm screwed.

00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:21.660
So I take XOR of v's
path and w's path.

00:46:25.710 --> 00:46:30.090
And then I mask this thing,
which stores which edges

00:46:30.090 --> 00:46:31.410
were deleted.

00:46:31.410 --> 00:46:35.270
And then I check whether
that word equals 0.

00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:37.564
If it equals 0, yes,
I can get there.

00:46:37.564 --> 00:46:39.230
If it doesn't equal
0, I can't get there

00:46:39.230 --> 00:46:41.230
because some edge was deleted.

00:46:41.230 --> 00:46:46.600
So very easy, because we can
fit log n bits in a word.

00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:51.770
OK, that's the bottom
tree structure.

00:46:51.770 --> 00:46:54.935
Next we need a path structure.

00:47:23.180 --> 00:47:26.960
Here we can use due constant
amortized with a similar trick.

00:47:30.650 --> 00:47:33.560
So here's our path.

00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:37.610
We're going to use,
essentially, indirection again.

00:47:37.610 --> 00:47:40.349
Again, we know how to
solve this in log n.

00:47:40.349 --> 00:47:42.890
When we have a sequential thing,
our usual way of indirection

00:47:42.890 --> 00:47:44.030
is to split into chunks.

00:47:47.850 --> 00:47:51.410
Each chunk here, I need
to be about log n in size.

00:47:51.410 --> 00:47:53.840
So I'll just make it
exactly log n in size.

00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:56.570
So there's n over log n chunks.

00:47:56.570 --> 00:47:59.330
So if I store a
summary vector, we

00:47:59.330 --> 00:48:01.880
can think of these
as being 0, 1, 0, 1,

00:48:01.880 --> 00:48:04.280
whatever, where the 1's mean
this edge has been deleted.

00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:06.300
0 means it hasn't been deleted.

00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:14.630
All right, let me write n over
log n chunks, each log n edges.

00:48:19.190 --> 00:48:21.720
And I'm going to store
each chunk as a bit vector.

00:48:28.180 --> 00:48:30.390
Bit vector has log n bits.

00:48:30.390 --> 00:48:31.620
w's at least log n.

00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:34.690
So I can do the same sort
of things I could do before.

00:48:34.690 --> 00:48:39.270
If I delete an edge, I just set
a 1 bit in the chunk vector.

00:48:42.990 --> 00:48:45.370
Now, that's good
for local queries.

00:48:45.370 --> 00:48:47.310
If I want to do a
long-distance query,

00:48:47.310 --> 00:48:51.690
I need to basically summarize,
are any of these edges deleted?

00:48:51.690 --> 00:48:53.535
If so, I'll put a 1 up here.

00:48:53.535 --> 00:48:54.660
Any of these edges deleted?

00:48:54.660 --> 00:48:57.000
If not, put a 0.

00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:59.340
And now, I want to
structure over-- this,

00:48:59.340 --> 00:49:02.490
you might call the summary
vector, like in [INAUDIBLE]..

00:49:02.490 --> 00:49:05.470
Done that before with
indirection as well.

00:49:05.470 --> 00:49:08.280
Now, this summary vector
has size n over log n.

00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:13.360
So I can afford to use our log
n solution that we started with.

00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:26.730
So use 1 on summary
vector of chunks.

00:49:26.730 --> 00:49:31.230
Because again, the first time
I set one of the bits in here,

00:49:31.230 --> 00:49:32.700
I have to do an update up here.

00:49:32.700 --> 00:49:33.600
But only then.

00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:36.409
Once it's been done once, I
don't have to update again.

00:49:36.409 --> 00:49:38.200
So there will only be
n over log n updates.

00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:40.510
So I can afford
log n per update.

00:49:40.510 --> 00:49:43.410
It'll still be linear time
total, constant per operation

00:49:43.410 --> 00:49:45.300
amortized.

00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:46.870
So this is my solution.

00:49:46.870 --> 00:49:52.440
If I have a query, let's say
I want to know between here

00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:57.000
and here, I first check, can
I get to the right endpoint

00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:58.200
locally?

00:49:58.200 --> 00:50:00.720
Which is a query
within the chunk.

00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:02.660
Which is again, I just
mask out these bits.

00:50:02.660 --> 00:50:04.494
I say and now do I
have the 0 vector?

00:50:04.494 --> 00:50:06.660
In which case, nothing I
care about has been deleted

00:50:06.660 --> 00:50:07.910
and I can get there?

00:50:07.910 --> 00:50:11.160
Or if I don't have the 0
vector, I can't get there.

00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:13.740
I want to know, can I get
to the left from here?

00:50:13.740 --> 00:50:16.020
Again it's a mask and
a check against 0.

00:50:16.020 --> 00:50:17.910
And then I want to
know, can I go over

00:50:17.910 --> 00:50:20.730
this interval of chunks?

00:50:20.730 --> 00:50:23.970
And that, I can use
the summary vector for.

00:50:23.970 --> 00:50:28.032
And again, that is a
mask of a subinterval,

00:50:28.032 --> 00:50:29.490
and then checking
whether it has 0.

00:50:29.490 --> 00:50:34.320
So I take the and of these
three results, and I'm done.

00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:36.137
That gives me a
query over a path.

00:50:36.137 --> 00:50:36.970
So it's kind of fun.

00:50:36.970 --> 00:50:38.860
We use two levels
of indirection.

00:50:38.860 --> 00:50:43.040
One to reduce the
number of leaves.

00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:44.910
And then these were
sort of trivial.

00:50:44.910 --> 00:50:48.900
And then within the structure,
we could only afford things

00:50:48.900 --> 00:50:50.400
on the non-branching
part, so we had

00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:51.649
to deal with paths separately.

00:50:51.649 --> 00:50:54.270
And there we use another
level of indirection.

00:50:54.270 --> 00:50:56.550
But in the end, we get
rid of all of our logs.

00:50:56.550 --> 00:51:02.270
And it's constant amortized
for deletions in a tree.

00:51:02.270 --> 00:51:04.360
Questions about that?

00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:09.250
That was our second
result. We have one more.

00:51:34.929 --> 00:51:36.470
Last result we're
going to talk about

00:51:36.470 --> 00:51:39.310
is log squared n
update, log over log log

00:51:39.310 --> 00:51:41.980
query, for general graphs.

00:51:41.980 --> 00:51:45.890
Finally, we graduate from
trees to general graphs.

00:52:24.100 --> 00:52:28.420
This is a result by Holm,
de Lichtenberg, and Thorup,

00:52:28.420 --> 00:52:32.740
2001 is the journal version.

00:52:32.740 --> 00:52:34.540
So we want to solve
dynamic connectivity.

00:52:34.540 --> 00:52:37.372
We want to understand,
in general,

00:52:37.372 --> 00:52:39.580
when two vertices are in
the same connected component

00:52:39.580 --> 00:52:40.780
or not.

00:52:40.780 --> 00:52:43.370
That sounds tricky.

00:52:43.370 --> 00:52:45.970
We're going to do that
in a pretty simple way

00:52:45.970 --> 00:52:47.080
at a high level.

00:52:47.080 --> 00:52:52.286
High level is, we want to
store a spanning forest.

00:52:52.286 --> 00:52:53.660
You know what a
spanning tree is.

00:52:53.660 --> 00:52:56.786
Spanning forest, well, your
graph might be disconnected.

00:52:56.786 --> 00:52:58.660
That's the whole point
of the data structure.

00:52:58.660 --> 00:53:01.344
If it's not disconnected,
you answer yes all the time.

00:53:01.344 --> 00:53:03.010
When it's disconnected
you say, OK, I'll

00:53:03.010 --> 00:53:04.640
have a spanning tree for
this connected component,

00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:06.473
spanning tree for every
connected component.

00:53:06.473 --> 00:53:08.770
Together we call that
a spanning forest.

00:53:08.770 --> 00:53:12.010
That's the maximal connectivity
you can get, but represented

00:53:12.010 --> 00:53:12.940
as a tree.

00:53:12.940 --> 00:53:14.740
Now, we have a great
way to represent

00:53:14.740 --> 00:53:17.710
trees, Euler-tour trees.

00:53:17.710 --> 00:53:21.010
And if you somehow connected
together two components,

00:53:21.010 --> 00:53:24.460
that is an insertion of an edge
in an Euler-tour structure.

00:53:24.460 --> 00:53:26.020
Great.

00:53:26.020 --> 00:53:28.600
So we can maintain all
these connected components

00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:31.750
and merge them if we
have to, using an insert

00:53:31.750 --> 00:53:33.790
in Euler-tour structure.

00:53:33.790 --> 00:53:35.659
And to do a connectivity query--

00:53:35.659 --> 00:53:38.200
I don't think I mentioned this--
you do find root on v and w,

00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:40.050
see whether they're
the same root.

00:53:40.050 --> 00:53:43.510
Because root is a canonical name
for the connected component.

00:53:43.510 --> 00:53:46.885
You can solve connectivity using
find root in constant time.

00:53:46.885 --> 00:53:51.270
Well, constant extra time,
log for the find root.

00:53:51.270 --> 00:53:52.900
OK, so everything looks great.

00:53:52.900 --> 00:53:53.890
I can connectivity.

00:53:53.890 --> 00:53:55.120
I can do insertion.

00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:57.730
What about deletion?

00:53:57.730 --> 00:54:02.080
If I delete an edge that is
not in my spanning forest,

00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:02.852
I'm happy.

00:54:02.852 --> 00:54:04.810
I have exactly the same
connectivity as before,

00:54:04.810 --> 00:54:07.180
as proved by the
spanning forest.

00:54:07.180 --> 00:54:09.040
The trouble is when I
delete an edge that's

00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:10.960
in the spanning forest.

00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:14.080
Then it's like, uh, maybe.

00:54:14.080 --> 00:54:17.420
So here's spanning
tree, whatever.

00:54:22.690 --> 00:54:27.280
And now let's say I
delete this edge here.

00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:29.440
Then there's a
couple possibilities.

00:54:33.147 --> 00:54:34.480
It was a graph, it's not a tree.

00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:35.620
So there could be
some other edge

00:54:35.620 --> 00:54:36.870
that connects those two trees.

00:54:36.870 --> 00:54:38.509
Then I have to find it.

00:54:38.509 --> 00:54:39.550
Oh, I'm going to find it.

00:54:39.550 --> 00:54:40.990
That's going to be annoying.

00:54:40.990 --> 00:54:42.490
Or it could be
there's no such edge.

00:54:42.490 --> 00:54:43.450
Then I'm fine.

00:54:43.450 --> 00:54:45.610
Then it's just a cut.

00:54:45.610 --> 00:54:47.050
But distinguishing
those two cases

00:54:47.050 --> 00:54:48.258
is going to be our challenge.

00:54:48.258 --> 00:54:50.950
And that's where we're going
to lose another log factor,

00:54:50.950 --> 00:54:53.189
but only another log factor.

00:54:53.189 --> 00:54:55.480
To only lose another log
factor, what we're going to do

00:54:55.480 --> 00:54:59.560
is not just store
one spanning forest.

00:54:59.560 --> 00:55:01.040
We will store the
spanning forest,

00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:03.910
but then we're going to
hierarchically decompose it

00:55:03.910 --> 00:55:08.110
and say, well, yeah,
there's this big tree.

00:55:08.110 --> 00:55:13.600
But some of the edges I'm going
to put in the next level down.

00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:14.560
Some I won't.

00:55:14.560 --> 00:55:17.890
So some subset of this forest
will be at the next level down.

00:55:17.890 --> 00:55:19.660
And there's going
to be log n levels.

00:55:19.660 --> 00:55:21.850
That's where we
lose our log factor.

00:55:21.850 --> 00:55:25.060
And the weird thing is,
there's no real reason

00:55:25.060 --> 00:55:29.200
to put things down, except we'll
use it as a charging scheme.

00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:32.740
We'll prove that an edge can
only go down log n levels.

00:55:32.740 --> 00:55:36.190
And then it has to get deleted
before it becomes relevant

00:55:36.190 --> 00:55:36.820
again.

00:55:36.820 --> 00:55:42.960
So it will let us charge
only log n times per edge.

00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:44.710
OK, that's about as
good as I can give you

00:55:44.710 --> 00:55:45.626
a high-level overview.

00:55:45.626 --> 00:55:48.040
Now we have to see the details.

00:55:48.040 --> 00:55:53.740
It's kind of amazing that
this works, but it does.

00:55:53.740 --> 00:55:57.320
So we're going to talk
about the level of an edge.

00:55:57.320 --> 00:56:01.970
This is not a
definition, per se.

00:56:01.970 --> 00:56:04.420
But it's a change in
quantity over time.

00:56:04.420 --> 00:56:06.520
As you do edge
deletions, some edges

00:56:06.520 --> 00:56:08.590
are going to decrease in level.

00:56:08.590 --> 00:56:13.060
They all start at log n.

00:56:13.060 --> 00:56:14.576
Log n is going to
be the top level.

00:56:14.576 --> 00:56:15.950
That's the whole
spanning forest.

00:56:19.390 --> 00:56:23.320
They will only decrease,
so it's monotone.

00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:25.840
And they can never get below 0.

00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:27.430
So we start at log n.

00:56:27.430 --> 00:56:28.960
They could go down.

00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:31.720
And the lowest value is 0.

00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:35.350
Now, Gi is my graph.

00:56:35.350 --> 00:56:40.105
And G is going to be the
subgraph of lower-level edges.

00:56:47.785 --> 00:56:52.210
It's going to say, level
less than or equal to i.

00:56:52.210 --> 00:56:54.730
So in particular, G log
n is the whole graph.

00:56:57.830 --> 00:57:00.530
So we always include
lower-level edges.

00:57:00.530 --> 00:57:03.490
So level 0 is going to
appear in all the Gi's.

00:57:03.490 --> 00:57:08.370
But if we look at G 0,
it's only level 0 edges.

00:57:08.370 --> 00:57:10.186
G1 is level 0 and 1.

00:57:10.186 --> 00:57:12.310
And so this is sort of a
hierarchical decomposition

00:57:12.310 --> 00:57:12.790
of the graph.

00:57:12.790 --> 00:57:14.498
We have fewer edges
at the bottom levels.

00:57:17.530 --> 00:57:19.450
And there's going to
be two key invariants

00:57:19.450 --> 00:57:22.530
we have over these structures.

00:57:22.530 --> 00:57:27.740
In variant one it's is going
to be every connected component

00:57:27.740 --> 00:57:30.135
of Gi is small.

00:57:43.711 --> 00:57:46.240
It's going to be size,
at most, 2 to the i.

00:57:51.140 --> 00:57:52.570
This is really
what's going to let

00:57:52.570 --> 00:57:54.160
us charge against something.

00:57:54.160 --> 00:57:56.680
Whenever you go down
a level, the max size

00:57:56.680 --> 00:57:59.740
of a connected component
goes down by a factor of 2.

00:57:59.740 --> 00:58:03.380
So at level 0, all
components have size 1.

00:58:03.380 --> 00:58:05.760
There are no edges at level 0.

00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:06.580
So I kind of lied.

00:58:06.580 --> 00:58:09.320
I guess the lowest level is 1.

00:58:09.320 --> 00:58:12.140
At level 1, you can
have two vertices.

00:58:12.140 --> 00:58:15.000
So there can be
isolated edges in Gi.

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:16.050
But that's it.

00:58:16.050 --> 00:58:20.500
You can't have a path of length
2 in G1, and so on up the tree.

00:58:20.500 --> 00:58:22.420
At G log n, you can
have the whole graph.

00:58:22.420 --> 00:58:24.010
Whole thing could be connected.

00:58:24.010 --> 00:58:27.100
But this will let us
charge to something

00:58:27.100 --> 00:58:28.510
as we go down in the tree.

00:58:31.240 --> 00:58:33.790
As we go down in
levels, I should say.

00:58:47.890 --> 00:58:52.900
So next thing we need is a
spanning forest for each Gi.

00:58:52.900 --> 00:58:56.050
Fi is going to be
spanning forest of Gi.

00:58:58.690 --> 00:59:03.550
So it's going to maintain the
connected components of Gi.

00:59:03.550 --> 00:59:06.300
And we're going to store that
using an Euler-tour tree.

00:59:13.355 --> 00:59:14.855
There's this issue
of pluralization.

00:59:14.855 --> 00:59:16.820
I'll say trees.

00:59:16.820 --> 00:59:18.710
Because Fi is disconnected.

00:59:18.710 --> 00:59:20.330
Each connected
component you use,

00:59:20.330 --> 00:59:23.390
you store using an
Euler-tour tree.

00:59:23.390 --> 00:59:27.200
Together, it's an Euler-tour
forest, I suppose.

00:59:27.200 --> 00:59:28.850
So that way we can do a query.

00:59:28.850 --> 00:59:30.530
And so given two
nodes, we can know

00:59:30.530 --> 00:59:34.040
whether they're in the same
connected component in Fi,

00:59:34.040 --> 00:59:38.390
just by saying whether they
live under the same root.

00:59:41.090 --> 00:59:43.050
Well, in particular,
that means that f

00:59:43.050 --> 00:59:45.940
log n, which is a
spanning forest of G log

00:59:45.940 --> 00:59:50.940
n, which is everything, that
will let me solve queries.

00:59:50.940 --> 00:59:55.780
This is the desired
spanning forest

00:59:55.780 --> 00:59:58.677
that will let me ask
connectivity queries.

00:59:58.677 --> 01:00:00.260
So all this
infrastructure is in order

01:00:00.260 --> 01:00:02.330
to support deletes efficiently.

01:00:02.330 --> 01:00:03.439
But queries are easy.

01:00:03.439 --> 01:00:04.730
We just look at the top forest.

01:00:04.730 --> 01:00:07.520
That's the one we want.

01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:10.400
OK, now second
invariant, this is

01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:12.082
where things get interesting.

01:00:15.938 --> 01:00:16.902
Variant 2.

01:00:19.552 --> 01:00:21.630
The forests have to nest.

01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:30.245
So F log n, of course,
has the most edges.

01:00:30.245 --> 01:00:32.420
F0 is going to have
the fewest edges.

01:00:32.420 --> 01:00:35.840
But I want them to be contained
in this nested structure.

01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:38.000
All this is saying is
that there's really only

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.495
one spanning forest, F log n.

01:00:40.495 --> 01:00:50.030
Fi is just F log n, but
restricted to the edges of Gi.

01:00:50.030 --> 01:00:52.730
So really we're trying
to represent this forest.

01:00:52.730 --> 01:00:55.130
But then, as we look
at lower levels,

01:00:55.130 --> 01:00:57.490
we just forget about
the higher-level edges.

01:00:57.490 --> 01:01:00.200
Restrict to the lower edges of
level less than or equal to i,

01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:01.791
that's our smaller force.

01:01:01.791 --> 01:01:04.040
This is, in some sense, the
hierarchical decomposition

01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:05.275
of the forest.

01:01:05.275 --> 01:01:07.430
Because there's really
only one forest.

01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:10.640
That would make our
lives way easier.

01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:15.440
Fun fact, is that that
forest, then, is actually not

01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:16.850
just any spanning forest.

01:01:16.850 --> 01:01:20.420
It's a minimum spanning
forest, with respect to level.

01:01:24.762 --> 01:01:26.720
You've probably heard of
minimum spanning tree.

01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:29.180
Minimum spanning forest
is just the analog

01:01:29.180 --> 01:01:31.060
for disconnected graphs.

01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:39.000
So we're defining the weight
of an edge to be it's level.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:42.460
And so F log n can't just
be any spanning forest.

01:01:42.460 --> 01:01:44.750
It has to prefer
lower-level edges.

01:01:44.750 --> 01:01:48.440
Otherwise, this nesting
structure won't be true.

01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:52.005
Now, that doesn't uniquely
define the forest or anything.

01:01:52.005 --> 01:01:53.630
Because maybe all
the levels are log n.

01:01:53.630 --> 01:01:56.840
And then every spanning forest
is a minimum spanning forest.

01:01:56.840 --> 01:02:00.890
But it's a constraint
on spanning forest.

01:02:00.890 --> 01:02:04.040
Cool Let's go over here.

01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:31.120
Let me quickly say how to do an
insert and how to do a query.

01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:33.340
These are really easy.

01:02:33.340 --> 01:02:34.970
Delete is really
where the action is,

01:02:34.970 --> 01:02:40.340
but just to make sure
we're on the same page,

01:02:40.340 --> 01:02:42.790
and to introduce a
little bit of notation,

01:02:42.790 --> 01:02:45.640
and say a little bit
about what we do.

01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:48.820
We are going to store
incidence lists, which

01:02:48.820 --> 01:02:53.260
is for every vertex, we
have a list of the incident

01:02:53.260 --> 01:02:55.570
edges in a linked list.

01:02:59.050 --> 01:03:00.930
So in constant time, we
can add our edge to v

01:03:00.930 --> 01:03:02.110
and w's incidence lists.

01:03:02.110 --> 01:03:06.250
That's not maintaining any
order or anything special.

01:03:06.250 --> 01:03:13.540
Then we also set the level
of the edge to the log n.

01:03:13.540 --> 01:03:16.937
That's what I said, every
edge starts at level log n.

01:03:16.937 --> 01:03:18.520
And then there's one
more thing, which

01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:31.720
is if v and w are
disconnected, and F log n,

01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:35.110
we can tell that because we
can do a connectivity query

01:03:35.110 --> 01:03:36.232
on F log n.

01:03:36.232 --> 01:03:37.690
We have that as an
Euler-tour tree.

01:03:37.690 --> 01:03:40.180
So we can see whether v and w
are in different components.

01:03:40.180 --> 01:03:41.800
If they are, we
have to merge them.

01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:43.750
So we merge them.

01:03:43.750 --> 01:03:47.849
We This is what you
call an edge insertion.

01:03:52.340 --> 01:03:55.390
So this is an Euler-tour
tree insertion,

01:03:55.390 --> 01:03:57.045
that we know how to do in log n.

01:03:57.045 --> 01:04:00.508
We reroute and we do a join.

01:04:00.508 --> 01:04:02.640
So that's cheap.

01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:04.640
And that's it.

01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:07.930
So insertion is easy to do
in log n time, actually.

01:04:07.930 --> 01:04:10.524
Its deletion that's
going to be painful.

01:04:10.524 --> 01:04:12.690
Actually, we're going to
charge through the inserts.

01:04:12.690 --> 01:04:14.648
So it'll be end up being
log squared amortized.

01:04:14.648 --> 01:04:17.770
But worst case, it's log n.

01:04:17.770 --> 01:04:19.244
Great.

01:04:19.244 --> 01:04:21.160
I want to say a little
bit about connectivity.

01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:24.100
Now we know how to solve
connectivity already.

01:04:24.100 --> 01:04:28.870
We do find root on v
and w and in log n time,

01:04:28.870 --> 01:04:31.450
we determine whether they're
in the same component.

01:04:31.450 --> 01:04:36.560
But I actually claimed--
it's maybe erased by now.

01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:37.170
Yeah.

01:04:37.170 --> 01:04:38.560
But I claim not to log n query.

01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:40.660
I claimed a log
over log log query.

01:04:40.660 --> 01:04:43.400
Turns out, that's
really easy to do.

01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:48.100
You just change the top
level minimum spanning forest

01:04:48.100 --> 01:04:49.720
slightly.

01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:57.940
So I want to make F log
n equal to a B-tree.

01:04:57.940 --> 01:04:59.880
Or actually, it's
a bunch of B-trees,

01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:05.290
one per connected component,
of branching factor log n.

01:05:08.475 --> 01:05:10.600
I guess it's a B-tree, so
I have to have some slop.

01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:13.600
Theta log n, let's say.

01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:16.720
Usually we said with
Euler-tour trees,

01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:19.090
it was a balanced
binary search tree.

01:05:19.090 --> 01:05:22.780
I'm going to make this
particular forest use a log n

01:05:22.780 --> 01:05:24.700
way, B-tree.

01:05:24.700 --> 01:05:26.560
This is going to
slow down updates.

01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:29.710
But it actually
speeds up queries.

01:05:29.710 --> 01:05:36.280
So to do a find root is
now a little bit easier.

01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:42.790
Find root should just
be log base log n of n,

01:05:42.790 --> 01:05:45.850
which is log n over log log n.

01:05:45.850 --> 01:05:48.250
Because find root, you just
need to go to your parent,

01:05:48.250 --> 01:05:49.660
to your parent, to your parent.

01:05:49.660 --> 01:05:50.390
Go to the top.

01:05:50.390 --> 01:05:52.840
And then you have to go
to the leftmost place.

01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:54.924
But it's easy, in a
B-tree, to always go

01:05:54.924 --> 01:05:55.840
to the leftmost place.

01:05:55.840 --> 01:05:57.130
If I had to do a
search within the node,

01:05:57.130 --> 01:05:58.360
that would be annoying.

01:05:58.360 --> 01:06:00.160
But going to the
leftmost, that's easy.

01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:03.190
So I only pay log over
log log for query,

01:06:03.190 --> 01:06:06.410
so I got my desired query time.

01:06:06.410 --> 01:06:08.620
And I claim the
update is kind of OK.

01:06:08.620 --> 01:06:11.530
Because it's slowed down, but
we're already going to pay

01:06:11.530 --> 01:06:13.090
log square eventually.

01:06:13.090 --> 01:06:14.470
And here we were doing log.

01:06:14.470 --> 01:06:20.080
So we don't need
to be that fast.

01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:23.160
Update is now going to be--

01:06:23.160 --> 01:06:29.290
let's see-- the
height of the tree

01:06:29.290 --> 01:06:31.120
times the branching factor.

01:06:34.230 --> 01:06:37.870
If we touch nodes in
a root-to-leaf path,

01:06:37.870 --> 01:06:39.310
there's log over
log log of them.

01:06:39.310 --> 01:06:41.309
For each one, we have to
rewrite the whole node.

01:06:41.309 --> 01:06:42.510
So we pay log.

01:06:42.510 --> 01:06:44.660
But this is less
than log squared.

01:06:49.970 --> 01:06:51.620
So this won't end up hurting us.

01:06:51.620 --> 01:06:54.205
Because we only do this
at the top forest level.

01:06:54.205 --> 01:06:55.580
We don't do it at
all the levels.

01:06:55.580 --> 01:06:56.996
If we did it at
all the levels, we

01:06:56.996 --> 01:07:00.290
would lose another log factor,
log over log log factor.

01:07:00.290 --> 01:07:02.960
But here, we do this
once at the top,

01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:04.520
pay log squared over log log.

01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:07.117
Then we have to update log n
other levels, each paying log.

01:07:07.117 --> 01:07:09.450
So we're already paying log
squared for the lower level.

01:07:09.450 --> 01:07:12.500
So if we increase the top
level a bit, not a big deal.

01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:18.230
So that's how you improve
connectivity queries slightly.

01:07:18.230 --> 01:07:19.760
And now, finally,
we get to deletes.

01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:24.188
This is the moment
you've been waiting for.

01:07:24.188 --> 01:07:27.812
How do we do a delete
in this structure?

01:07:27.812 --> 01:07:29.270
What are all these
levels good for?

01:07:42.860 --> 01:07:44.260
So we're deleting an edge e.

01:07:44.260 --> 01:07:48.260
Its endpoints are v and w.

01:07:48.260 --> 01:07:51.355
First thing we do is remove
e from the incidence list.

01:07:59.676 --> 01:08:01.300
If every edge stores
a pointer to where

01:08:01.300 --> 01:08:02.758
it lives in the
incidence list, you

01:08:02.758 --> 01:08:05.578
can do that deletion
in constant time.

01:08:05.578 --> 01:08:06.550
Great.

01:08:06.550 --> 01:08:14.530
So as I said, if e is
not in this forest--

01:08:21.670 --> 01:08:23.930
what if it's in a
lower level of forest?

01:08:27.220 --> 01:08:28.504
Oh, I see, right.

01:08:28.504 --> 01:08:29.810
I forgot.

01:08:29.810 --> 01:08:32.930
In variant two, variant two
says the forests are nested.

01:08:32.930 --> 01:08:36.040
So if it's in any forest, it's
going to be in the last one.

01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:37.540
So if it's not in
the last one, that

01:08:37.540 --> 01:08:39.160
means it's not in
any of the forests.

01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:40.076
That means we're done.

01:08:40.076 --> 01:08:41.240
We do nothing.

01:08:41.240 --> 01:08:43.492
That's the easy case.

01:08:43.492 --> 01:08:44.950
We didn't destroy
any connectivity,

01:08:44.950 --> 01:08:47.300
because the forests represent
maximal connectivity.

01:08:47.300 --> 01:08:48.939
They're spanning.

01:08:48.939 --> 01:08:52.120
But if it's in the forest,
then something changed.

01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:54.580
Then we need to determine,
like in this picture,

01:08:54.580 --> 01:08:56.229
is there a replacement edge?

01:08:56.229 --> 01:08:58.880
Or is there no replacement edge?

01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:01.009
In which case, when there's
no replacement edge,

01:09:01.009 --> 01:09:02.300
we basically don't do anything.

01:09:02.300 --> 01:09:06.859
We have to do a bunch of
deletes in the forests.

01:09:06.859 --> 01:09:11.500
But yeah, is that what
I want to say next?

01:09:11.500 --> 01:09:13.430
Yes, we always do that.

01:09:13.430 --> 01:09:14.830
We're going to delete e.

01:09:14.830 --> 01:09:15.760
We have to delete e.

01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:24.490
So we're going to recursively
delete it from f sub e dot

01:09:24.490 --> 01:09:31.814
level up to F log n. e
dot level is the earliest

01:09:31.814 --> 01:09:32.689
forest it appears in.

01:09:32.689 --> 01:09:34.355
And we have to delete
it from all those.

01:09:34.355 --> 01:09:37.770
Each of those is an Euler-tour
tree deletion, or cut.

01:09:37.770 --> 01:09:40.240
And so each of them pays log
n total cost log squared n.

01:09:40.240 --> 01:09:42.790
So this is where the log
squared's coming from.

01:09:42.790 --> 01:09:43.540
That's great.

01:09:43.540 --> 01:09:45.700
Now we've successfully
deleted the edge.

01:09:45.700 --> 01:09:48.609
But now we need to know,
is there a replacement?

01:09:48.609 --> 01:09:50.520
And at what level is
there a replacement?

01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:56.380
Now, we know by invariant
2, that there could be

01:09:56.380 --> 01:09:59.380
no replacement of lower level.

01:09:59.380 --> 01:10:03.300
The point is, this is a
minimum spanning tree.

01:10:03.300 --> 01:10:05.230
So e was the lowest
level edge that

01:10:05.230 --> 01:10:08.710
could connect the two sides,
these two connected components

01:10:08.710 --> 01:10:10.720
of the forest.

01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:15.160
So if there's any replacements
at e's level or higher,

01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:17.540
there might not be a
replacement at e dot level.

01:10:17.540 --> 01:10:18.940
But there might be a
replacement at a higher level.

01:10:18.940 --> 01:10:21.023
We want to find the smallest
level for which there

01:10:21.023 --> 01:10:21.970
is a replacement.

01:10:21.970 --> 01:10:24.130
That will preserve
invariant 2, that we

01:10:24.130 --> 01:10:26.890
have a minimum spanning forest.

01:10:26.890 --> 01:10:29.350
So that's what we're going
to do, loop over the levels

01:10:29.350 --> 01:10:32.500
to try to find a
replacement edge.

01:10:32.500 --> 01:10:37.090
So we're going to start
at e dot level, loop

01:10:37.090 --> 01:10:41.740
potentially up to log
n, call it a level i.

01:10:41.740 --> 01:10:46.270
Then I want to identify,
at level i, the two

01:10:46.270 --> 01:10:47.320
sides of the edge.

01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:58.810
Let Tv and Tw be the trees
of Fi, containing v and w,

01:10:58.810 --> 01:11:00.660
respectively.

01:11:00.660 --> 01:11:03.100
We just deleted the edge
connecting those two sides.

01:11:03.100 --> 01:11:07.310
So we know that they're in two
different trees, Tv and Tw.

01:11:07.310 --> 01:11:09.650
And one of them is
smaller than the other.

01:11:09.650 --> 01:11:15.100
I'd like to relabel v and
w so that the size of Tv

01:11:15.100 --> 01:11:17.410
is less than or equal
to the size of Tw, size,

01:11:17.410 --> 01:11:24.240
in terms of number of vertices
from there in the tree.

01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:27.780
So swapped v and w if necessary.

01:11:27.780 --> 01:11:28.890
Here's the fun thing.

01:11:28.890 --> 01:11:38.520
If we apply invariant
1, then we learn

01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:41.210
these sizes are not so big.

01:11:41.210 --> 01:11:43.320
Claim, at most, 2 to the i.

01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:45.130
As you realize it's
almost 2 to the i,

01:11:45.130 --> 01:11:48.050
you have to imagine the moment
before this deletion happened,

01:11:48.050 --> 01:11:50.120
before we deleted the edge.

01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:53.240
Because at that point, Tv and
Tw were actually one tree.

01:11:53.240 --> 01:11:55.120
They were connected by edge e.

01:11:55.120 --> 01:11:56.120
We've just deleted them.

01:11:56.120 --> 01:11:59.090
But the moment before we
deleted them, invariant 1 held.

01:11:59.090 --> 01:12:00.772
And so that was a
connected component.

01:12:00.772 --> 01:12:02.480
It should have size,
at most, 2 to the i.

01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:03.560
Now, we split it.

01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:04.820
But that's all we've done.

01:12:04.820 --> 01:12:07.560
So the sum of those sizes
has to be at most 2 to the i.

01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:10.760
Because that used to be
a connected component.

01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:12.050
Cool

01:12:12.050 --> 01:12:19.190
So that means that size of Tv
is 1/2 that, at most 2 to i

01:12:19.190 --> 01:12:19.990
minus 1.

01:12:19.990 --> 01:12:23.130
Because Tv is less
than or equal to Tw.

01:12:23.130 --> 01:12:26.980
So it's, at most,
1/2 of the total.

01:12:26.980 --> 01:12:29.682
So Tv is even smaller.

01:12:29.682 --> 01:12:31.140
In particular, what
that tells us--

01:12:31.140 --> 01:12:33.740
now we have Tv and Tw as
kind of separate components

01:12:33.740 --> 01:12:34.920
temporarily--

01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:38.640
we don't really know that
they're separate at level i.

01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:41.159
But we know at level i
minus 1 they are separate.

01:12:41.159 --> 01:12:43.200
At level i minus 1, there
is no replacement edge,

01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:46.050
by the minimum spanning
forest property.

01:12:46.050 --> 01:12:49.470
So what we could
do, at this point,

01:12:49.470 --> 01:12:52.740
is take Tv, take all of
the edges internal to Tv,

01:12:52.740 --> 01:12:55.860
and push them down
to level i minus 1.

01:12:55.860 --> 01:12:57.635
We could afford that.

01:12:57.635 --> 01:12:59.260
What do I mean by we
could afford that?

01:12:59.260 --> 01:13:01.166
We wouldn't destroy invariant 1.

01:13:01.166 --> 01:13:02.790
Because we're taking
2 to the i minus 1

01:13:02.790 --> 01:13:05.754
vertices, pushing
all those edges down.

01:13:05.754 --> 01:13:07.170
We don't have to
push all of them.

01:13:07.170 --> 01:13:09.110
We could push some
subset of the edges down.

01:13:09.110 --> 01:13:11.700
Whatever connectivity
component we make at that level

01:13:11.700 --> 01:13:14.325
will be of size at
most 2 to d, i minus 1,

01:13:14.325 --> 01:13:16.110
and so invariant 1
will be preserved.

01:13:18.730 --> 01:13:19.950
So great.

01:13:19.950 --> 01:13:25.220
We can afford in
this certain sense of

01:13:25.220 --> 01:13:40.702
"afford," to push all of Tv's
edges to level i minus 1.

01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:48.080
Great

01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:51.170
We don't actually
need to do this.

01:13:51.170 --> 01:13:54.470
But what we're going to do
is use it to pay for stuff.

01:14:02.150 --> 01:14:03.740
We have this scary
goal, which is

01:14:03.740 --> 01:14:06.686
we want to find is there
a replacement edge?

01:14:06.686 --> 01:14:08.810
I don't know a good way to
find a replacement edge,

01:14:08.810 --> 01:14:10.685
except to do, basically,
a depth first search

01:14:10.685 --> 01:14:12.680
and look at all the edges.

01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:15.090
That's going to
take a lot of time.

01:14:15.090 --> 01:14:17.030
But the good news
is, if we search

01:14:17.030 --> 01:14:21.020
from Tv, every edge
that's useless,

01:14:21.020 --> 01:14:23.244
we can just decrease its level.

01:14:23.244 --> 01:14:25.160
And whenever we decrease
the level of an edge,

01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:28.260
we basically get a
free coin to continue.

01:14:28.260 --> 01:14:30.290
So you get a free
life every time you

01:14:30.290 --> 01:14:32.750
push an edge down by one level.

01:14:32.750 --> 01:14:34.280
Because overall,
number of pushes

01:14:34.280 --> 01:14:40.550
can be number
insertions times log n.

01:14:40.550 --> 01:14:43.830
Because every edge can only
be pushed long n times.

01:14:43.830 --> 01:14:48.080
So whenever we push down an
edge, we get a free bonus life,

01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:50.330
so we can keep doing our search.

01:14:50.330 --> 01:14:52.325
So here's how the search works.

01:14:52.325 --> 01:14:57.335
I'm going to say, for each--

01:14:57.335 --> 01:15:00.620
this is a little bit
tricky to implement.

01:15:00.620 --> 01:15:02.900
I'm going to first tell
you what we want to do

01:15:02.900 --> 01:15:04.162
and why that's OK.

01:15:04.162 --> 01:15:05.870
And then we'll see
how we actually do it.

01:15:10.730 --> 01:15:14.280
So I want to search
from every vertex in Fv.

01:15:14.280 --> 01:15:17.470
I want to look at all the
outgoing edges from there

01:15:17.470 --> 01:15:20.612
of level i.

01:15:20.612 --> 01:15:22.070
Never mind how to
find those edges.

01:15:22.070 --> 01:15:25.610
Just pretend you could find
it in constant time per edge.

01:15:25.610 --> 01:15:27.920
It's going to be
log n time per edge.

01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:29.951
But that's OK.

01:15:29.951 --> 01:15:32.060
It's two cases.

01:15:32.060 --> 01:15:36.260
Either y is in Tw.

01:15:36.260 --> 01:15:39.320
Otherwise, y is
going to be in Tv.

01:15:42.440 --> 01:15:44.850
Because we have Tv here.

01:15:44.850 --> 01:15:46.700
We have Tw.

01:15:46.700 --> 01:15:50.240
We just deleted this edge, e.

01:15:50.240 --> 01:15:52.640
Sadly, we want to find
a replacement edge.

01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:56.210
So if we look at all the edges
coming out of a vertex in Tv,

01:15:56.210 --> 01:15:58.310
this is, I guess, x.

01:15:58.310 --> 01:16:00.710
It could be it's an edge
that stays within Tv.

01:16:00.710 --> 01:16:02.750
Or could be it's an
edge that goes to Tw.

01:16:02.750 --> 01:16:05.780
There are no other options,
because of our invariants.

01:16:05.780 --> 01:16:09.470
If it's in Tv, oh,
that's kind of annoying.

01:16:09.470 --> 01:16:11.430
Doesn't help us.

01:16:11.430 --> 01:16:14.960
But then we can just set
the level of that edge,

01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:20.072
e-prime, to be i minus 1.

01:16:20.072 --> 01:16:22.880
Because we can afford
to push all of these

01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:24.110
edges down by one level.

01:16:24.110 --> 01:16:26.480
So that pays for this
round of the loop.

01:16:30.587 --> 01:16:31.670
What about the other case?

01:16:31.670 --> 01:16:33.044
The other cases
is the good case.

01:16:33.044 --> 01:16:36.020
That means we've found a
replacement edge for e.

01:16:36.020 --> 01:16:38.260
If we have an edge
from Tv to Tw.

01:16:38.260 --> 01:16:41.880
And at level i, we did
these levels in order.

01:16:41.880 --> 01:16:42.690
Did I say that?

01:16:42.690 --> 01:16:44.930
Yeah, we're doing
levels in order.

01:16:44.930 --> 01:16:48.670
So if we can find this is the
lowest level replacement edge,

01:16:48.670 --> 01:16:49.960
so we do it.

01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:58.370
We insert that edge into
Fi using an Euler-tour tree

01:16:58.370 --> 01:17:00.100
insertion.

01:17:00.100 --> 01:17:02.500
And then we're done.

01:17:02.500 --> 01:17:05.260
So we stop the algorithm.

01:17:05.260 --> 01:17:07.180
The moment we find a
desired edge we're happy.

01:17:07.180 --> 01:17:08.638
Now, maybe there
are lots of edges.

01:17:08.638 --> 01:17:10.910
So we've got to stop when
we find the first one.

01:17:10.910 --> 01:17:13.810
Then we've restored our minimum
spanning forest property.

01:17:13.810 --> 01:17:17.650
We have maximal connectivity,
all these great things.

01:17:17.650 --> 01:17:19.300
As long as we
don't find an edge,

01:17:19.300 --> 01:17:22.400
we can push things down a
level and pay for this round.

01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:25.237
So it's constant time or log
n time to do the last step.

01:17:25.237 --> 01:17:27.820
But all the other steps are paid
for by the decrease in level.

01:17:31.870 --> 01:17:35.890
So the claim is overall,
we pay log squared n.

01:17:35.890 --> 01:17:38.860
Because we had to do log
squared n for these deletions.

01:17:38.860 --> 01:17:48.740
Plus log n times the
number of level decreases.

01:17:51.820 --> 01:17:53.030
That's for this step.

01:17:53.030 --> 01:17:56.972
I claim that each round
of this loop cost log n.

01:17:56.972 --> 01:17:58.430
So that's why we've
get log n times

01:17:58.430 --> 01:17:59.513
number of level decreases.

01:17:59.513 --> 01:18:02.150
But number of level
decreases is, at most,

01:18:02.150 --> 01:18:05.417
number of edge
insertions times log n.

01:18:05.417 --> 01:18:07.250
Because each edge can
only decrease in level

01:18:07.250 --> 01:18:10.290
log n times, by
definition of levels.

01:18:10.290 --> 01:18:12.320
And so we can charge to
the insert operations

01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:15.650
at a factor of log n.

01:18:15.650 --> 01:18:17.090
So there's two log n's here.

01:18:17.090 --> 01:18:20.500
So inserts now cost log
squared amortized as well.

01:18:20.500 --> 01:18:22.330
To deletes costs log
squared amortized.

01:18:22.330 --> 01:18:25.460
And we get log squared overall.

01:18:25.460 --> 01:18:28.760
One last issue though, which
is how do we do this step?

01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:31.370
Actually, there's another
step that's not so trivial,

01:18:31.370 --> 01:18:32.450
this one.

01:18:32.450 --> 01:18:35.540
We need to know the size
of Tv and the size of Tw.

01:18:35.540 --> 01:18:36.290
Well, that's easy.

01:18:36.290 --> 01:18:38.390
I just store subtree
sizes at every node.

01:18:38.390 --> 01:18:41.720
So then I look at
the root of the BST,

01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:44.270
and it tells me how
big that tree is.

01:18:44.270 --> 01:18:47.420
And so I can see which is
bigger and switch accordingly.

01:18:47.420 --> 01:18:48.980
But that's trivial.

01:18:48.980 --> 01:18:50.900
This one requires a
different augmentation

01:18:50.900 --> 01:18:54.840
for Euler-tour trees.

01:18:54.840 --> 01:18:56.480
And again, in both
of these situations,

01:18:56.480 --> 01:18:59.120
we're using the fact that we
can augment on subtrees, not

01:18:59.120 --> 01:18:59.700
on paths.

01:18:59.700 --> 01:19:02.910
That's why we need Euler-tour
trees, not link cut trees.

01:19:02.910 --> 01:19:06.405
So what we store in F--

01:19:06.405 --> 01:19:08.690
why did I write Fv?

01:19:08.690 --> 01:19:11.060
I mean Tv here.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:19.580
So in Fi-- this is for each i,
but at the forest at level i--

01:19:19.580 --> 01:19:22.970
what I'm going to store is at
every node in the Euler-tour

01:19:22.970 --> 01:19:28.830
tree, I want to know in the
subtree rooted in that node--

01:19:28.830 --> 01:19:31.430
so here's Euler-tour tree.

01:19:31.430 --> 01:19:35.405
Here's a node, v.
This is a tree in Fi.

01:19:35.405 --> 01:19:38.990
I want to know, in
this subtree, in here,

01:19:38.990 --> 01:19:46.180
is there any node that has a
level i edge incident to it?

01:19:46.180 --> 01:19:49.262
So I want to know, are
there any level i edges?

01:19:53.366 --> 01:19:54.990
If there aren't any
level i edges, then

01:19:54.990 --> 01:19:57.110
for the purposes
of this search, I

01:19:57.110 --> 01:19:58.930
should just skip that subtree.

01:19:58.930 --> 01:20:02.310
It's as if the
subtree was erased.

01:20:02.310 --> 01:20:03.340
So I have some tree.

01:20:03.340 --> 01:20:04.620
It has height log n overall.

01:20:04.620 --> 01:20:06.270
I erase some of the
subtrees according

01:20:06.270 --> 01:20:09.610
to this bit, which is an
easy thing to keep track of.

01:20:09.610 --> 01:20:13.670
It's an augmentation,
constant factor overhead.

01:20:13.670 --> 01:20:17.310
Then I basically want to
do an in-order traversal

01:20:17.310 --> 01:20:20.460
of this tree, but
skipping the stuff below.

01:20:20.460 --> 01:20:23.160
So I mean, one way to think of
it is you just repeatedly call

01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:26.047
successor, like successor
in a binary search tree.

01:20:26.047 --> 01:20:28.380
But whenever I see that there's
no level edges below me,

01:20:28.380 --> 01:20:30.900
I just skip.

01:20:30.900 --> 01:20:33.720
So in log n time you can
basically find the next place

01:20:33.720 --> 01:20:35.250
where there's an outgoing edge.

01:20:35.250 --> 01:20:37.080
I guess also, the
incidence lists

01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:40.090
have to be stored
separately for each level.

01:20:40.090 --> 01:20:42.270
So you can say, what are
your outgoing level i

01:20:42.270 --> 01:20:43.387
edges from a vertex?

01:20:43.387 --> 01:20:44.970
This lets you find
the vertex quickly,

01:20:44.970 --> 01:20:47.040
but then you have to
find the edges quickly.

01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:50.100
So the instance lists are not
just stored as one single link

01:20:50.100 --> 01:20:52.510
lists, one link list per level.

01:20:52.510 --> 01:20:53.850
But that's easy to do.

01:20:53.850 --> 01:20:56.450
So then from this, vertex we
can find all the outgoing level

01:20:56.450 --> 01:20:57.870
i edges.

01:20:57.870 --> 01:21:01.650
And we can do this
4 loop efficiently.

01:21:01.650 --> 01:21:05.705
And whenever it's
low, we get to charge.

01:21:05.705 --> 01:21:08.220
In the remaining
negative two minutes,

01:21:08.220 --> 01:21:11.142
let me tell you briefly
about other problems that

01:21:11.142 --> 01:21:11.850
have been solved.

01:21:11.850 --> 01:21:15.240
So this finishes log squared
n fully dynamic connectivity.

01:21:15.240 --> 01:21:17.550
I wasn't planning to spend
much time on this anyway.

01:21:17.550 --> 01:21:18.060
There are notes.

01:21:18.060 --> 01:21:19.470
If you're interested in
the specific problems,

01:21:19.470 --> 01:21:21.390
I'll just tell you
what the problems are.

01:21:21.390 --> 01:21:23.820
Generalization of connectivity
is k connectivity.

01:21:23.820 --> 01:21:26.730
I don't just want to know, is
there one path from v to w?

01:21:26.730 --> 01:21:30.450
I want to know are there k
disjoint paths from v to w?

01:21:30.450 --> 01:21:34.380
So they could be edge-disjoint
or vertex-disjoint paths,

01:21:34.380 --> 01:21:36.600
might be your goal.

01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:40.860
In that case, poly
log solutions are

01:21:40.860 --> 01:21:43.752
known for 2 connectivity
edge or vertex.

01:21:43.752 --> 01:21:46.210
This is the result, actually,
I used in my very first graph

01:21:46.210 --> 01:21:49.380
algorithms papers, where I first
learned about dynamic graphs.

01:21:49.380 --> 01:21:52.200
In log to the fourth n time,
you can maintain 2 edge

01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:54.480
connectivity.

01:21:54.480 --> 01:22:00.570
It's open for k equals
3, even, whether you

01:22:00.570 --> 01:22:02.130
can achieve that bound.

01:22:02.130 --> 01:22:04.560
So kind of lame.

01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:06.847
Another problem is
minimum spanning forest.

01:22:06.847 --> 01:22:09.180
So you don't just want to
maintain some spanning forest.

01:22:09.180 --> 01:22:10.680
Maybe you actually have
weights on the edges

01:22:10.680 --> 01:22:12.517
and you want the
minimum spanning for us.

01:22:12.517 --> 01:22:14.850
That it turns out, you can
solve with a couple extra log

01:22:14.850 --> 01:22:15.370
factors.

01:22:15.370 --> 01:22:19.996
So in log to the fourth
n time, with an extra log

01:22:19.996 --> 01:22:21.870
squared factor, you can
reduce to the problem

01:22:21.870 --> 01:22:22.860
of dynamic connectivity.

01:22:22.860 --> 01:22:24.359
And so log to the
forth overall, you

01:22:24.359 --> 01:22:27.409
can maintain minimum
spanning forest.

01:22:27.409 --> 01:22:28.950
Another problem is
planarity testing.

01:22:28.950 --> 01:22:32.150
You want to insert or delete
edges and, at all points,

01:22:32.150 --> 01:22:34.980
know whether your
graph is planar.

01:22:34.980 --> 01:22:38.850
And that, there's no great
results known for that.

01:22:38.850 --> 01:22:40.810
It's like n to the 2/3.

01:22:40.810 --> 01:22:44.430
Directed graphs,
things get really hard.

01:22:44.430 --> 01:22:46.844
There are two problems
I've surveyed here.

01:22:46.844 --> 01:22:47.760
There's probably more.

01:22:47.760 --> 01:22:49.410
But the most
fundamental questions

01:22:49.410 --> 01:22:52.260
are the analog of
connectivity is

01:22:52.260 --> 01:22:55.080
what I call dynamic
transitive closure, which

01:22:55.080 --> 01:22:58.680
means given two vertices,
v and w, I want to know,

01:22:58.680 --> 01:23:03.180
is there a directed path from
v to w instead of undirected?

01:23:03.180 --> 01:23:05.520
At the moment, a
bunch of results

01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:10.890
match a trade-off curve
which should be update times

01:23:10.890 --> 01:23:15.860
query is roughly m times n, a
number of edges times number

01:23:15.860 --> 01:23:16.830
of vertices.

01:23:16.830 --> 01:23:19.820
This is big.

01:23:19.820 --> 01:23:23.550
But there are a bunch of results
that achieve this trade-off.

01:23:23.550 --> 01:23:25.290
I don't think I'm
matching lower bound.

01:23:25.290 --> 01:23:28.920
But it's also open, whether
this entire trade-off

01:23:28.920 --> 01:23:30.330
curve could be achieved.

01:23:30.330 --> 01:23:32.700
There's various points on
the curve where you pay

01:23:32.700 --> 01:23:34.050
square root of n for an update.

01:23:34.050 --> 01:23:36.240
Then you pay like,
m times square root

01:23:36.240 --> 01:23:40.330
of n for the query or vice
versa, stuff like that.

01:23:40.330 --> 01:23:41.760
And then a harder
version of this

01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:43.135
is you have weights
on the edges.

01:23:43.135 --> 01:23:45.300
And now the query is
not just find a path,

01:23:45.300 --> 01:23:47.460
find the shortest path.

01:23:47.460 --> 01:23:50.470
This is what I call dynamic
all pairs shortest paths.

01:23:50.470 --> 01:23:51.960
This is even harder.

01:23:51.960 --> 01:23:56.040
There are some results where you
can do like, roughly, n squared

01:23:56.040 --> 01:23:58.110
time updates constant query.

01:23:58.110 --> 01:24:00.840
So it's maybe similar
type of trade-off curves,

01:24:00.840 --> 01:24:03.630
not really known.

01:24:03.630 --> 01:24:05.410
When all the weights
of the edges are 1,

01:24:05.410 --> 01:24:07.410
you just want to find the
shortest path in terms

01:24:07.410 --> 01:24:11.910
of the number of edges, you can
do not really that much better.

01:24:11.910 --> 01:24:13.740
Still, this is the product.

01:24:13.740 --> 01:24:17.160
But at least more of the
trade curve has been solved.

01:24:17.160 --> 01:24:21.512
So that's a quick overview of
dynamic graphs, more generally.

01:24:21.512 --> 01:24:23.720
Dynamic graphs come up all
over the place, obviously.

01:24:23.720 --> 01:24:27.302
You have network where the
links are changing, or Facebook,

01:24:27.302 --> 01:24:29.385
you want to maintain
connections but people friend

01:24:29.385 --> 01:24:30.900
and de-friend all the time.

01:24:30.900 --> 01:24:35.000
So you want to maintain whatever
structure you care about.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.310
Anyway, that's dynamic
graphs upper bounds.

01:24:37.310 --> 01:24:41.500
Next class will be
lower bounds, the log n.
