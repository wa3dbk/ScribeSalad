00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:21.860
ERIK DEMAINE: All right.

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.480
Today, we resume our theme of
memory hierarchy efficient data

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.680
structures.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.920
And last time, we saw
cache-oblivious b-trees,

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:37.400
which achieve log base B
of N for all operations--

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.410
insert, delete, search.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.110
And the cool part is
that we could do that

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.770
without knowing what B was.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.160
And it was basically
a binary search tree

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.310
stored in a funny order,
this van Emde Boas order,

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:01.040
with an ordered file
on the bottom, which

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.150
we left as a black box.

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:03.830
And today, we're
going to see how

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:05.810
to actually do ordered files--

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.960
in log squared N, data
moves per insert and delete.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.060
And then as a little
diversion, we'll

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.860
see a closer related
problem to this

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.160
is called list labeling,
which we needed in Lecture 1

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.100
and left it as a black
box for full persistence.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.030
We had this version tree
with full persistence,

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.140
and we needed to linearize
that version tree

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.810
into a bunch of numbers
so that we could then

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.824
compare whether one version
was an ancestor of another.

00:01:35.824 --> 00:01:38.240
And for that, we needed to be
able to store a linked list,

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.400
and insert and delete
in the linked list,

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.930
and be able to query, who is
this node in the linked list,

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.690
precede this node
in the linked list

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.035
in constant time per operation.

00:01:49.035 --> 00:01:54.109
So we'll also do that
today because it's time.

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:56.150
And then we're going to
do a completely different

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.070
cache-oblivious data structure.

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.670
That's interesting, mainly in
the way that it adapts to M,

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.350
not just B. So remember, B was
the size of a memory block.

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:07.850
When we fetch
something from memory,

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.050
we get the entire block of size
B. M was the size of the cache.

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.810
And so there were M over B
blocks in the cache of size

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.180
B. So that's what
we'll do today.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.395
I'm also going to need a claim--

00:02:27.332 --> 00:02:29.710
which we won't prove here--

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.270
that you can sort
cache-obliviously in N

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.920
over B log base N
over B of N over B.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.120
So I'm going to use this
as a black box today.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.203
And we're not going to
fill it in because it's not

00:02:41.203 --> 00:02:43.480
a data structure, and it's
a data structures class.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.340
To give you some feeling for
why this is the right bound

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.970
for sorting, if
you know M and B,

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:55.040
then the answer is M
over B way mergesort.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.290
So you all know
binary mergesort,

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.060
where you split into two parts.

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.160
If you split into M
over B parts and then do

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.950
an M over B way merge,
that's exactly what

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.390
a cache can handle.

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.320
It can read one block
from each of the lists

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.470
that it's trying to merge.

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.000
It has just enough
cache blocks for that.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.210
And then you do the merge
block by block, load new blocks

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:25.166
as necessary.

00:03:25.166 --> 00:03:26.790
That will give you
a linear time merge.

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.850
And so you'll get N over
B times log base M over B.

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.460
And it turns out the right
thing in here is N over B or N

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.520
is basically the same,
because it's inside the log.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.530
It's not a big deal.

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.090
So external memory wise,
that's how you do it.

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.450
You can do this
cache-obliviously in a similar

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:43.125
way to--

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.850
roughly speaking, in a
similar way to the way

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.070
we do b-trees,
where you're binary

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:54.060
searching in the
number of ways you

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.401
should divide your array into.

00:03:57.401 --> 00:03:59.150
I'm not going to get
into details on that.

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.860
We'll focus on
cache-oblivious priority

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.131
queues, which do a similar kind
of thing, but get it a dynamic.

00:04:06.131 --> 00:04:06.630
All right.

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.740
But before we go there, let's
do ordered file maintenance.

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.640
So let me first remind
you of the problem.

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:32.520
We want to store N
items in a file, which

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:41.040
think of as an array, size
order N. This constant's

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:46.170
bigger than 1, with
constant-sized gaps.

00:04:53.970 --> 00:05:06.030
And then-- I should
say in specified order,

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:09.330
subject to inserting and
deleting items in that order.

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:34.240
So this was the picture.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.070
We have an array.

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:42.680
We get to store some
objects in the array

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.180
and have these blank
cells in between.

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.040
But each of these gaps
has constant size.

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.420
Maybe these data items
are sorted, maybe not.

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:00.310
And then we're able
to say things like,

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:05.550
OK, insert a new
item 8 right after 7.

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:07.540
And so then you'd
like to do that.

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:12.910
Then you'd also, then, like to
say OK, now insert new item 9,

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:14.530
here.

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:17.500
And then this guy will
maybe get shifted over.

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.570
So 12 is over here.

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:22.257
This becomes blank, and then
you can fit the 9, and so on.

00:06:22.257 --> 00:06:24.340
You want to be able to do
insertions and deletions

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:25.810
like that quickly.

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:35.890
And quickly, here,
means whenever

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:38.440
we do an insert or delete,
we're going to rearrange items

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:39.180
in an interval.

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:46.360
And that interval is
going to be small--

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:50.060
log squared N amortized.

00:06:55.542 --> 00:06:57.300
That's all I need to say here.

00:07:00.689 --> 00:07:02.480
I guess we also want
to say that when we're

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:03.938
moving these items
in the interval,

00:07:03.938 --> 00:07:06.230
we can do it efficiently
cache-obliviously, because we

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:09.800
really want log
squared N divided by B.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:19.810
And we say that via constant
number of interleaved scans.

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:23.000
Scans, we know, as long as
there's a number of them

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.319
and your cache has at least a
constant size number of blocks,

00:07:26.319 --> 00:07:28.610
then interleave scans are
always going to be efficient.

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:32.150
You always get to divide
by B. But the focus

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:34.370
will be on making sure
the interval is small.

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:37.040
The rearrangement will actually
be very simple, so not too hard

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:37.540
to do.

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:49.310
So this will give us log squared
N over B amortized memory

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:51.080
transfers.

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:53.030
So that was the
black box we needed

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:56.120
to get cache-oblivious b-trees.

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:58.100
Remember, we got rid of
the square in the log

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:01.310
by using a level of indirection
that removed one of the logs.

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:03.260
So we got log N
over B. So we were

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.000
dominated by log
base B of N, which

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.240
is what we had for
the search over here.

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:10.670
So this is the step we need.

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:12.517
And this is a general
tool used in a bunch

00:08:12.517 --> 00:08:14.600
of different cache-oblivious
data structures, sort

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:16.910
of one of the first
cache-oblivious data structure

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:18.690
tools.

00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:21.090
It's pretty handy.

00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:23.170
It's actually much older
than cache-oblivious

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:25.200
or external memory models.

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:28.790
This results-- removing the
last line and this part,

00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:30.920
which makes it
efficient in this model.

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:34.159
Just thinking about moving
around intervals in a file

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:38.360
goes back to Itai,
Konheim, and Rodeh in 1981.

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:40.070
So it's pretty old.

00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:44.430
And then it was brought to the
cache-oblivious world in 2000,

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:48.740
right when this model
was getting started.

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:52.550
So that's the goal.

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:56.730
Now let me tell you how
this is going to work.

00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:58.980
So a rough idea is very simple.

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:01.370
You have your array.

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:05.550
And when you insert an
item, what we want to do

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:09.330
is find an interval
containing that item

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:12.860
of some reasonable
size that's not

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:15.800
too full and not too sparse.

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:18.089
If we can find--

00:09:18.089 --> 00:09:19.880
so like right here,
when we're inserting 9,

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:21.525
it looks really bad
right around there.

00:09:21.525 --> 00:09:23.150
And so there's, like,
too many elements

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:24.524
packed right around
that element.

00:09:24.524 --> 00:09:25.940
And that feels bad to us.

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:29.120
So we grow an interval around
it until we've got enough gaps.

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:31.400
And then we just evenly
redistribute the items

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.669
in that interval.

00:09:33.669 --> 00:09:35.460
So that's basically
what we're going to do.

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:37.550
We just have to
find the right size

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:39.510
interval to rearrange items in.

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:41.060
Then when we do
the rearrangement,

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:43.610
it's always going to be
evenly redistributing

00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:45.380
within the interval.

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:46.640
So that strategy is simple.

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.760
And to think about intervals
in a nice controlled way,

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:52.620
we're going to build
a binary tree--

00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:54.020
our good friend.

00:09:54.020 --> 00:10:02.510
So let me just draw
this binary tree.

00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:09.320
Now I need to do
something a little bit

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:12.470
special at the leaves.

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:17.750
I'm going to cluster
together log N items.

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:20.870
So down here is the array,
and all of this stuff

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:22.250
up here is conceptual.

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:23.580
We don't really build it.

00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:30.770
In my lecture notes, I
can just copy and paste

00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:33.960
and this is a lot easier.

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:37.565
So we have these chunks of
size theta log N at the bottom.

00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:45.050
I don't really care
what the constant is.

00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:46.250
1 is probably fine.

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:56.640
So this is the array
down here, and we're

00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:03.810
splitting every log N items,
or log N cells in the array.

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:06.520
And then we say, OK,
well conceptually build

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:07.770
a binary structure tree, here.

00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:11.100
And then this node
represents this interval.

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:14.930
And this node represents
this interval.

00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:17.730
Every node just represents the
interval of all its descendant

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:19.080
leaves.

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:23.040
We've seen this trick
over and over again.

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:25.030
But we're not going to
build any data structure

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:27.930
or have some augmentation
for each of these nodes.

00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:30.650
This is how we're going
to build the intervals.

00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:32.025
We're going to
start at the leaf.

00:11:32.025 --> 00:11:34.740
Let's say we want to
insert an item in here.

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:35.650
So we insert it here.

00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:38.155
If there's not room for it,
we're going to walk up the tree

00:11:38.155 --> 00:11:41.610
and say, OK, if this
interval is too dense,

00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:44.580
I'll look at this node and
its corresponding interval

00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:45.840
here to here.

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:49.170
If that's still too dense,
I'll walk up to the parent,

00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:52.020
and so look at this
interval from here to here,

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:55.320
and so on, until I find
that in the end, at most,

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:59.280
I redistribute the entire array.

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:02.610
And when I do that, I'll
just evenly redistribute.

00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:09.340
Let me write down the
algorithm for update.

00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:14.330
So for insert or
delete, same algorithm,

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:21.275
you update the leaf log N chunk.

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:28.990
You can do that just by
rewriting the entire chunk.

00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:30.740
We're trying to get a
log squared N bound,

00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:32.698
so we can afford to
rewrite it interval as size

00:12:32.698 --> 00:12:35.270
log N. So that's for free.

00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:41.210
So whatever leaf
contains the element

00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:42.560
you want to insert or delete.

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:50.510
And then we're going to
walk up the tree until we

00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:51.965
find a suitable interval.

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:10.470
And we're going to call
that node, or that interval,

00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:11.610
within threshold.

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:22.650
So let me define
within threshold.

00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:27.300
We're going to look at
the density of a node,

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:30.000
or an interval.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.840
And that's just going to be the
ratio of the number of elements

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:37.524
that are actually down there
versus the amount of slots

00:13:37.524 --> 00:13:38.940
in the array that
are down there--

00:13:42.052 --> 00:13:43.260
so just how much is occupied.

00:14:00.794 --> 00:14:01.710
So look at that ratio.

00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:04.180
If it's 100%, then there are
no blank cells down there.

00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:08.150
If it's 0%, then
everybody is blank.

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:09.900
So we don't want either
of those extremes.

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:11.670
We want something in between.

00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:14.010
And we're going to do that
by specifying thresholds

00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:16.230
on this density and
try to keep the density

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:18.710
within those thresholds.

00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:21.604
Let me let me define
those thresholds.

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:35.870
The fun part is that the density
thresholds that you maintain

00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:37.970
depend on which level you are.

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:45.530
Not, like, experience points,
but in which height of the tree

00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:46.190
you are.

00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:49.550
So down here, we don't really
care how well-distributed

00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:50.570
the leaves are.

00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:53.300
I mean, it can't
be 0% because then

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:54.920
that would be a really big gap.

00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:57.620
But it could be say
between 50% and 100%.

00:14:57.620 --> 00:14:59.300
It could be totally full.

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:02.150
And then once it's overflowing,
then we've got to go up.

00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:06.940
And the higher we go,
the stricter we get--

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:12.570
hopefully, yes-- strictest
at the top of the tree.

00:15:12.570 --> 00:15:24.800
So in general, if we have
a node of the depth, d,

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:32.810
then we want the density
to be at least 1/2

00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:36.530
minus 1/4 d over h.

00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:52.690
And we want the density to be at
most 3/4 plus 1/4 d over it h.

00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:59.165
So h, here, is the height
of this tree, which

00:15:59.165 --> 00:16:02.410
is going to be something
like log N minus log-log N.

00:16:02.410 --> 00:16:04.230
But it doesn't really matter.

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:06.620
This is depth 0,
depth 1, depth h.

00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:15.840
We just are linearly
interpolating between--

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:19.905
let's see, this is always
between 1/4 and 1/2--

00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:26.330
1/2 when this is 0,
1/4 when this is h.

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:28.790
So you get a 1/2 minus 1/4.

00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:35.960
And this one is always
in the range 3/4 to 1.

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:40.310
It's 3/4 when this is
0, and 1 when this is h.

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:42.622
So at the bottom--

00:16:42.622 --> 00:16:43.580
I was a little bit off.

00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:49.400
At the bottom, the leaf
level, when these are both h--

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:53.600
the density has to be at
least a 1/4 and at most, 100%.

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:55.430
And then at the root,
it's going to have

00:16:55.430 --> 00:17:00.410
to be between 1/2 and 3/4.

00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:03.110
So it's a narrower range.

00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:06.260
And the higher you go up,
the more narrow the range

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:08.459
on the density gets.

00:17:08.459 --> 00:17:11.000
And we do it just sort of in
the obvious linear interpolation

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.530
way.

00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:15.609
The not so obvious thing is that
this is the right way to do it.

00:17:15.609 --> 00:17:17.900
There's a lot of choices
for how to set these density

00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:18.550
thresholds.

00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:22.010
But we have to basically
maintain constant density

00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:24.170
everywhere because
we're trying to maintain

00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:25.859
gaps of constant size.

00:17:25.859 --> 00:17:28.334
So we don't have a
lot of flexibility.

00:17:28.334 --> 00:17:29.750
But it turns out,
this flexibility

00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:32.630
between two constants,
like 1/4 and 1/2

00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:37.020
is enough to give us
the performance we need.

00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:38.780
So let's see why.

00:17:41.662 --> 00:17:42.870
Let me finish this algorithm.

00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:45.680
We walk up the tree
until reaching a node

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:46.670
within threshold.

00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:48.260
Density is this.

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:49.780
Density threshold is this.

00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:51.830
So now we know within
threshold means.

00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:59.840
And then we evenly
rebalance or redistribute

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:08.270
all the descendant
elements in that interval

00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:09.410
that is within threshold.

00:18:18.629 --> 00:18:20.170
So what you need to
check is that you

00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:22.420
can do this with a
constant number of scans.

00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:24.220
It's not that hard.

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:25.570
Just read the elements in order.

00:18:25.570 --> 00:18:27.109
Write them out to
a temporary array,

00:18:27.109 --> 00:18:28.150
and then write them back.

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:30.980
Or if you're fancy,
you can do it in place.

00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:33.430
But you can just do it by
a constant number of scans

00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:34.180
through the array.

00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:41.920
Just compute what should
be the average gap

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:43.230
between the elements.

00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:44.230
Leave that many gaps.

00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:50.880
So the algorithm
is pretty simple

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:54.090
once you say, OK, I'm
going to grow intervals.

00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:56.776
Then maybe, you think OK,
I guess I'll grow intervals

00:18:56.776 --> 00:18:57.900
according to a binary tree.

00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:59.316
It's a little bit
more controlled.

00:18:59.316 --> 00:19:01.420
Probably don't have
to do it this way.

00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:04.800
You could just grow
them by a factor of 2,

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:06.090
just around your point.

00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:10.121
But it's easier to analyze in
the setting of a binary tree.

00:19:10.121 --> 00:19:12.120
And then once you're doing
that, the tricky part

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:13.600
is to set the
density thresholds.

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:15.210
But you fool around
and this seems

00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:18.870
to be the best way to do it.

00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:20.920
Now the question is,
why does this work.

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:27.310
How do we prove log squared
amortized interval size when we

00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:28.560
follow these dense thresholds?

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:30.990
Notice that we're
not keeping intervals

00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:34.350
within density at all times.

00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:38.100
I mean, the whole problem
is that things are not

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:40.220
within threshold
right at the start.

00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:44.340
And we have to walk up the tree
quite a ways, potentially--

00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:48.480
claim is only about log-log
N levels up the tree--

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:50.160
to find something
that's within density.

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:51.570
And then we can redistribute.

00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:55.470
And then we fix
everything below us.

00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:55.970
All right.

00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:57.450
Well, let's get to that.

00:20:11.864 --> 00:20:13.405
This is really the
direction we want.

00:20:13.405 --> 00:20:15.460
The thresholds are getting
tighter and tighter,

00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:16.950
more constrained as we go up.

00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:19.590
Because it means if
we walk up a lot,

00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:23.640
we, essentially, can pay for it
because we bring that interval

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:27.500
even farther within threshold.

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:33.400
So we have some node,
which is within threshold.

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:35.640
So we bring it into the
density thresholds of here.

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:38.280
If we look at the
children of that node,

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:42.930
their density
thresholds are smaller--

00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:44.460
sorry, are more relaxed.

00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:46.350
So if we bring this
node into threshold

00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:48.450
by rewriting all the
leaves down here,

00:20:48.450 --> 00:20:50.820
these nodes will not
only be within threshold,

00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:54.090
they'll be far within threshold.

00:20:54.090 --> 00:20:58.660
If you look at their ratios,
you know, their densities--

00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:01.714
the number of elements in there,
divided by the array slots.

00:21:01.714 --> 00:21:03.130
It's going to be
exactly the same.

00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:07.050
The density is equal
because we're uniformly

00:21:07.050 --> 00:21:08.226
distributing the items here.

00:21:08.226 --> 00:21:09.600
And there's some
rounding errors,

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:12.070
but other than rounding.

00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:14.670
And that's actually why we have
these leaves as size theta log

00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:16.350
N, so the rounding
doesn't bite us.

00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:21.450
We're evenly redistributing
so the density is equal

00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:22.550
everywhere.

00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:25.320
Left child had the same
density as the parent.

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:28.890
But if you look at the density
thresholds of the child,

00:21:28.890 --> 00:21:31.270
they will be more relaxed
compared to the parent.

00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:32.850
So if the parent is
within threshold,

00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:35.460
the child will be
far within threshold

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:40.790
by at least a d over
h additive amount.

00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:43.860
Sorry, 1 over h, because
their depths differ by 1.

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:45.960
If this is d, this
would be d plus 1.

00:21:51.480 --> 00:22:08.400
When we rebalance a
node, we put the children

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:09.900
far within threshold.

00:22:15.610 --> 00:22:22.380
Meaning, if we look at
the absolute difference

00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:26.280
between the density and
either the upper threshold

00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:35.580
or the lower threshold, that
will be, I guess, at least 1

00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:43.960
over 4h because we're
increasing d by 1.

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:49.470
And it's 1 over for 4h
for each step we take.

00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:53.460
OK so the children
are extra happy.

00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:55.890
We walked up here
because before--

00:22:55.890 --> 00:22:57.510
let's say we walked
up this path.

00:22:57.510 --> 00:23:00.150
So we walked from
the right child.

00:23:00.150 --> 00:23:03.390
We didn't stop here,
which means this node was

00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:06.420
was beyond threshold.

00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:13.020
But now we walked up and now
we fixed this entire interval.

00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:14.700
And now it's far
within threshold.

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:18.360
So before, you know, the
density minus the threshold

00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:20.610
went the wrong way,
had the wrong sign.

00:23:20.610 --> 00:23:24.370
Now we're good, and we're
good by at least a 1 over 4h.

00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:27.420
Now h, here, was the
height of the tree.

00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:32.940
It's log N minus log-log N. All
we need is that this is theta

00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:35.180
log N--

00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:44.220
sorry, theta 1 over log
N. h is theta log N.

00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:47.930
And this is a ratio--

00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:50.330
1 over log N--

00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:53.979
of the number of items
versus the number of slots.

00:23:53.979 --> 00:23:55.520
But we know the
number of slots we're

00:23:55.520 --> 00:24:02.030
dealing with is theta log N. And
so this is at least one item.

00:24:02.030 --> 00:24:07.340
This log N is designed
to balance the h, here.

00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:08.310
OK, cool.

00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:12.790
Let's go over here.

00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:21.870
So the idea is if we're
far within threshold,

00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:23.714
we can charge to those items.

00:24:23.714 --> 00:24:24.380
That's our goal.

00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:52.540
What we're interested
in-- if we just

00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:54.820
rebalanced this node, say x.

00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:58.390
We want to know when is the
next time x can be rebalanced?

00:24:58.390 --> 00:25:00.610
For x to have to be
rebalanced, that means,

00:25:00.610 --> 00:25:03.880
again, one of its children will
have to be out of threshold.

00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:06.520
And then we insert or
delete within that child.

00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:09.130
And then that
propagates up to x.

00:25:09.130 --> 00:25:11.459
But right now, the children
are far within threshold.

00:25:11.459 --> 00:25:13.000
So the question is,
how long would it

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.060
take for them to get
out of threshold again?

00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:18.610
Well, you'd have to change
the density by at least 1

00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:20.380
over an additive--

00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:23.800
1 over log N. If you
multiply by the size,

00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:26.664
it's the size of
the interval divided

00:25:26.664 --> 00:25:29.080
by log N. You've got to have
at least that many insertions

00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:29.800
or deletions.

00:25:32.650 --> 00:25:41.131
Before this node rebalances
again, one of its children

00:25:41.131 --> 00:25:42.130
must get out of balance.

00:25:47.890 --> 00:25:54.400
And so you must have
done at least the size

00:25:54.400 --> 00:26:03.460
of the interval
divided by theta log N

00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:10.570
updates for one of the children
to become out of balance again.

00:26:10.570 --> 00:26:11.890
Boom.

00:26:11.890 --> 00:26:14.290
So when this rebalance
happens again,

00:26:14.290 --> 00:26:18.350
we're going to charge to
those updates, which is good

00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:20.580
because the time it takes
us to do the rebalance

00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:21.860
is the size of the interval.

00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:30.340
We need to charge each of
these items log N times.

00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:43.130
So charge the
rebalance cost, which

00:26:43.130 --> 00:26:52.930
is the size of the
interval to these updates.

00:26:57.430 --> 00:26:58.930
And what we know
is that the updates

00:26:58.930 --> 00:27:00.070
are within the interval.

00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:16.460
So this looks like a log N
bound, which is not right.

00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:19.040
It should be a log
squared N bound.

00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:27.650
The idea is when we insert
into one of these leaves,

00:27:27.650 --> 00:27:32.180
we're simultaneously making this
node worse and this node worse

00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:34.760
and this node worse.

00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:36.500
Whenever we insert
a node, it belongs

00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:39.609
to log N intervals
that we care about.

00:27:39.609 --> 00:27:41.400
So in fact, not only
are we losing this log

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:44.915
N, because there aren't quite
enough items to charge to--

00:27:44.915 --> 00:27:46.790
the log N factor less.

00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:50.960
We're also charging to each item
another factor of log N times

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:53.898
because it lives in all
these different intervals.

00:28:03.610 --> 00:28:14.260
Each update gets charged at
most, h, which is order log

00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:14.990
N times.

00:28:20.770 --> 00:28:24.250
We looked at what
happens for node x,

00:28:24.250 --> 00:28:26.440
but we have to apply this
argument simultaneously

00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:27.940
for all nodes x.

00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:30.250
Fortunately, this
node versus this node,

00:28:30.250 --> 00:28:31.750
they don't share
any descendants.

00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:33.650
And so there's no
multiple charging.

00:28:33.650 --> 00:28:36.005
But node x and its
parent and grandparent

00:28:36.005 --> 00:28:38.890
and all its
ancestors, they're all

00:28:38.890 --> 00:28:40.240
talking about the same nodes.

00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:41.740
And so they will
multiple charge,

00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:43.540
but only by a factor
of log N. That's

00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:46.870
something we've seen a few
times, charging log N times,

00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:49.870
for every node in the
tree, like range trees

00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:52.720
having N log N space
in two dimensions.

00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:55.470
Same deal.

00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:58.960
So we've got size of the
interval divided by log N guys

00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:02.530
to charge to, which we multiply
charge log N times, so we get

00:29:02.530 --> 00:29:04.290
a log squared amortized bound.

00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:20.490
So this log N is hard to avoid
because we have a binary tree

00:29:20.490 --> 00:29:22.890
that's pretty natural.

00:29:22.890 --> 00:29:28.050
This log N, essentially,
comes from this h.

00:29:28.050 --> 00:29:30.461
The fact that we can only
go from one constant factor

00:29:30.461 --> 00:29:30.960
to another.

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:33.570
And we've got log N
different steps to make.

00:29:33.570 --> 00:29:37.860
We have to do 1 over log
N increment every step.

00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:39.630
That's the best we could afford.

00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:45.880
That's why these are evenly
spaced out in this linear way.

00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:49.200
But if we had a little more
space, we could do better.

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:52.194
So that's going to lead us to
this list labeling problem.

00:29:52.194 --> 00:29:53.610
But first, are
there any questions

00:29:53.610 --> 00:29:54.818
about order file maintenance?

00:29:54.818 --> 00:29:56.370
At this point, we are done.

00:29:56.370 --> 00:29:57.034
Yeah.

00:29:57.034 --> 00:29:59.492
AUDIENCE: Can you explain again
how is it that you get from

00:29:59.492 --> 00:30:02.547
the size of the interval
[INAUDIBLE] and that each--

00:30:02.547 --> 00:30:03.880
ERIK DEMAINE: This amortization?

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:05.899
AUDIENCE: Yeah, how you
got to the amortized.

00:30:05.899 --> 00:30:06.690
ERIK DEMAINE: Yeah.

00:30:06.690 --> 00:30:07.689
So let me explain again.

00:30:07.689 --> 00:30:10.710
So when we do rebalance
of an interval,

00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:12.252
the cost is the size
of the interval.

00:30:12.252 --> 00:30:14.543
We're trying to analyze, what
is the size the interval?

00:30:14.543 --> 00:30:16.270
Prove that is log
squared N. So we have

00:30:16.270 --> 00:30:18.420
this cost of size of interval.

00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:23.430
We're charging it to the
items which just got inserted

00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:25.350
or deleted into that interval.

00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:30.000
Before this node rebalances
again, but in general,

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.950
we're interested in the--

00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:34.710
we can afford to rebalance
every node at the beginning.

00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:38.010
And then whenever
a node rebalances--

00:30:38.010 --> 00:30:41.040
before it rebalances,
one of its children

00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:42.390
had to be out of whack.

00:30:42.390 --> 00:30:46.380
For one of its children
to be out of whack,

00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:47.880
there had to have
been an insertion

00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:52.740
of at least the size of the
interval divided by log N,

00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:54.432
because log was h.

00:30:54.432 --> 00:30:55.890
There's a slight
discrepancy, here.

00:30:55.890 --> 00:30:57.570
We're talking about
the size of the parent

00:30:57.570 --> 00:30:59.528
interval versus the size
of the child interval,

00:30:59.528 --> 00:31:01.560
but that's just a factor of 2.

00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:04.380
So that's incorporated
by this theta.

00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:07.830
So you could have a little
theta here, too, if you like.

00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:09.960
OK, so for the child
to be out of whack,

00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:12.870
we had to have done updates of
size interval divided by log N.

00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:15.610
So we charge this cost to them.

00:31:15.610 --> 00:31:18.690
And so we have to charge log
N to each of those items,

00:31:18.690 --> 00:31:20.644
each of those updates.

00:31:20.644 --> 00:31:22.060
And then there's
a second problem,

00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:26.190
which is everybody gets charged
by all of its ancestors.

00:31:26.190 --> 00:31:28.930
And it has log N ancestors.

00:31:28.930 --> 00:31:32.380
So in all, each update gets
charged at most log squared N

00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:33.170
times.

00:31:33.170 --> 00:31:36.130
So you get amortized
log squared per update.

00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:44.710
Other questions?

00:31:44.710 --> 00:31:45.310
Cool.

00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:46.480
So that's ordered files.

00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:48.620
Now we have b-trees.

00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:53.230
We can handle this log squared
N. That was OK for B trees,

00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:54.910
using a layer of indirection.

00:31:54.910 --> 00:31:59.470
But it's natural to wonder
whether you can do better.

00:31:59.470 --> 00:32:01.990
In general, the conjecture
is that for ordered files,

00:32:01.990 --> 00:32:03.220
you cannot do better.

00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:05.740
If this is your problem
setup, if you can only

00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:08.920
have constant sized gaps,
you need a linear size array.

00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:11.110
You need log squared
N interval updates,

00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:13.320
but no one's proved
that lower bound.

00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:15.670
So that's one open question.

00:32:15.670 --> 00:32:19.000
Another fun fact is
we did amortized,

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:23.080
but it's actually
possible to do worst case.

00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:24.250
It's complicated.

00:32:24.250 --> 00:32:31.690
Willard did it in 1992.

00:32:31.690 --> 00:32:34.330
But let's talk about
relaxing the problem.

00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:37.230
So instead of saying, well, the
array has to be linear size,

00:32:37.230 --> 00:32:39.090
what if we let it to be bigger?

00:32:39.090 --> 00:32:40.440
And then you can do better.

00:32:44.890 --> 00:32:47.830
And this is a problem
called list labeling.

00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:57.870
So I'm going to rephrase it,
but it's essentially the same

00:32:57.870 --> 00:32:59.550
as order file maintenance.

00:32:59.550 --> 00:33:04.959
It's a little bit
less restriction.

00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:36.170
So it's a dynamic
linked list problem,

00:33:36.170 --> 00:33:37.580
like we've seen before.

00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:48.580
And each node at all
times stores a label such

00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:59.290
that labels are always
monotone down the list.

00:34:02.650 --> 00:34:04.130
So think of it this way.

00:34:04.130 --> 00:34:06.070
We have a linked list.

00:34:11.355 --> 00:34:13.730
And all we're interested is
maintaining this linked list.

00:34:13.730 --> 00:34:16.780
So we want to be able to
say, OK, delete this item

00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:19.030
and update these pointers.

00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:23.290
Or maybe, insert a
new item over here.

00:34:23.290 --> 00:34:25.330
And so it's going to
be linked like that.

00:34:25.330 --> 00:34:28.389
And at all times in
this cell here, we're

00:34:28.389 --> 00:34:35.274
storing a number, 3, 7,
12, 14, 42, whatever.

00:34:35.274 --> 00:34:38.739
It could be any
integer, let's say.

00:34:38.739 --> 00:34:40.790
And we need that the
numbers are increasing order

00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:43.239
down the linked list.

00:34:43.239 --> 00:34:47.000
Now, I claim this is basically
the same as an ordered file

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:48.130
problem.

00:34:48.130 --> 00:34:50.620
Just think of this number as
being the index in the array

00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:52.250
that you store it.

00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:54.502
So this should be
strictly monotone--

00:34:57.280 --> 00:35:03.670
I guess, increasing
down the list.

00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:05.650
That means none of these
numbers are the same.

00:35:05.650 --> 00:35:08.350
So we can store the items--

00:35:08.350 --> 00:35:10.930
whatever data is
associated with this node--

00:35:10.930 --> 00:35:13.720
we can store that in
the array position 3,

00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:16.690
in the array position 7,
in the array position 12.

00:35:16.690 --> 00:35:22.114
When we insert, we have to find
a new label between 3 and 7.

00:35:22.114 --> 00:35:24.280
Now we're allowed to change
the labels dynamically--

00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:25.690
that's what makes
this possible--

00:35:25.690 --> 00:35:29.410
which corresponds to
moving items in the array.

00:35:29.410 --> 00:35:34.420
And the only difference is about
how this is physically done.

00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:37.150
With ordered file, you have
to physically move items

00:35:37.150 --> 00:35:37.900
in the array.

00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:43.030
Here, you just change a number
and that's moving the item.

00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:46.210
Where this gets interesting is
if you allow the label space--

00:35:46.210 --> 00:35:48.850
which is the storage
space of the array--

00:35:48.850 --> 00:35:50.770
to become super linear.

00:35:50.770 --> 00:35:53.650
With ordered files, it doesn't
really make a lot of sense

00:35:53.650 --> 00:35:56.530
to go super linear, at least,
not by more than a couple log

00:35:56.530 --> 00:36:00.340
factors because time is
always at least space.

00:36:00.340 --> 00:36:03.130
If you have a giant array,
you have to initialize it.

00:36:03.130 --> 00:36:05.380
And you can't afford to
initialize an array of, say,

00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:08.960
N squared size, if you're
trying to maintain N items.

00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:10.420
But in list labeling, you can.

00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:14.380
I mean, if you say all these
numbers are between 0 and N

00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:17.500
squared, that's no
big deal because you

00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:21.490
can represent a number up to
N squared, which is two log N

00:36:21.490 --> 00:36:22.400
bits.

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:25.207
So squaring the space is no
big deal for list labeling.

00:36:25.207 --> 00:36:27.290
It would be a big deal for
order file maintenance,

00:36:27.290 --> 00:36:28.600
so that's why we rephrase.

00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:31.840
But they're basically
the same problem--

00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:35.140
just a little less useful
for cache-oblivious stuff.

00:36:42.740 --> 00:36:45.089
Let me tell you what's
known about mislabelling.

00:36:56.825 --> 00:37:11.220
In terms of the amount of
label space you're given,

00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:13.810
and how good a running
time per update

00:37:13.810 --> 00:37:17.460
we can get, in terms
of best known results.

00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:21.390
So what we just saw
is that if you do--

00:37:21.390 --> 00:37:22.804
we just said linear space.

00:37:22.804 --> 00:37:24.720
But in fact, you can get
1 plus epsilon space.

00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:28.380
You can say, oh, I wouldn't want
to waste 1% of my storage space

00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:29.560
in the array.

00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:32.370
And if you set the
theta at the leaves,

00:37:32.370 --> 00:37:36.612
here, to the right value,
then you can just waste 1%

00:37:36.612 --> 00:37:38.070
and still maintain
an ordered file.

00:37:38.070 --> 00:37:40.910
I think this is cool from
a file system perspective.

00:37:40.910 --> 00:37:44.790
But in particular, it
gives us what we need.

00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:47.940
And if you go up
to N log N space,

00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:50.490
it doesn't seem
to help you much.

00:37:50.490 --> 00:37:54.015
The best we know is log
squared N. As I mentioned,

00:37:54.015 --> 00:37:58.830
it could be amortized
or worst case.

00:37:58.830 --> 00:38:01.520
If you bump up the space to
N to the 1 plus epsilon--

00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:04.056
so a little bit super linear--

00:38:04.056 --> 00:38:10.122
and anything polynomial, then
the best we know is log N.

00:38:10.122 --> 00:38:11.580
And there is actually
a lower bound

00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:15.130
for this result in
a particular model.

00:38:15.130 --> 00:38:18.960
So it seems pretty clear that--

00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:21.630
at least for these style
of data structures,

00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:24.150
the best you can do in
this situation is log N.

00:38:24.150 --> 00:38:27.370
But hey, log N is
better than log squared.

00:38:27.370 --> 00:38:31.050
And the other obvious bound is
if you have exponential space,

00:38:31.050 --> 00:38:34.122
you can do constant,
essentially.

00:38:34.122 --> 00:38:35.580
Because with
exponential space, you

00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:37.110
can just keep
bisecting the interval

00:38:37.110 --> 00:38:39.630
between two items
in constant time

00:38:39.630 --> 00:38:41.487
until you've inserted N items.

00:38:41.487 --> 00:38:43.570
And then you can rebuild
the whole data structure.

00:38:43.570 --> 00:38:46.560
So that's sort of
the trivial result.

00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:49.590
If you don't care about
how big these labels get--

00:38:49.590 --> 00:38:52.151
and how big they would
get is 2 to the N--

00:38:52.151 --> 00:38:53.400
then you can do constant time.

00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:55.690
That's really the only way
we know how to do constant.

00:38:58.650 --> 00:39:00.480
So the interesting
new result, here,

00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:03.360
that I'm talking about
is for polynomial space,

00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:05.370
we can get log N.

00:39:05.370 --> 00:39:09.260
And rough idea is you just
fixed these density intervals.

00:39:09.260 --> 00:39:12.480
Now you don't have to make it--

00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:15.090
I mean, you're still going
to be divided by h, here,

00:39:15.090 --> 00:39:17.530
but your spread
can be much bigger.

00:39:17.530 --> 00:39:19.680
So your densities no longer
have to be constants.

00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:21.720
Now we can afford a density--

00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:25.050
near the root, we can get
a density of like 1 over--

00:39:25.050 --> 00:39:27.660
actually, anywhere, we
can afford a density of 1

00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:31.980
over N. Because if we have N
squared slots and only N items

00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:35.810
to put in them, then a decent
density is 1 over N, in fact.

00:39:35.810 --> 00:39:37.340
It could also be constant.

00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:39.330
Constant would be all right.

00:39:39.330 --> 00:39:42.180
So we've got a big spread there,
from 1 over N to constant.

00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:45.260
And so we can afford to
take much bigger jumps here,

00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:53.650
of like 1 over N. And so that
gets rid of this log N factor,

00:39:53.650 --> 00:39:55.650
essentially.

00:39:55.650 --> 00:39:58.450
That was the rough sketch.

00:39:58.450 --> 00:40:05.950
I have written, here,
that the densities we use

00:40:05.950 --> 00:40:08.060
are no longer uniformly spaced.

00:40:08.060 --> 00:40:11.110
The 1 over alpha to the d.

00:40:11.110 --> 00:40:19.600
Alpha, here, is some constant
in the interval between 1 and 2.

00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:21.070
And d is the depth.

00:40:21.070 --> 00:40:24.130
So now we have exponentially
increasing densities

00:40:24.130 --> 00:40:28.660
which give you a big gap--

00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:32.320
no longer lose
this log N factor.

00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:34.990
So you do exactly the
same data structure,

00:40:34.990 --> 00:40:36.650
these different densities.

00:40:36.650 --> 00:40:39.010
Now you've got room to
fill in a whole bunch

00:40:39.010 --> 00:40:42.840
more densities when you
have, say, N squared space.

00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:46.420
And so you only get the log N
factor because of the number

00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:47.471
of ancestors of a node.

00:40:47.471 --> 00:40:48.970
And you lose the
other log N factor.

00:40:55.470 --> 00:40:59.640
Now let me tell you
about another problem

00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:00.620
building on this.

00:41:11.672 --> 00:41:15.324
So this is the list order
maintenance problem.

00:41:15.324 --> 00:41:17.240
And this is the problem
we saw in a Lecture 1.

00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:32.540
So here, same as before,
maintain a linked list,

00:41:32.540 --> 00:41:40.880
subject to, insert a
node at this location,

00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:46.835
delete a node at this
location, and order queries.

00:41:53.720 --> 00:42:00.110
Is node x before
node y in the list?

00:42:03.110 --> 00:42:06.410
This is what we needed to
support full persistence.

00:42:06.410 --> 00:42:07.535
You have a big linked list.

00:42:14.430 --> 00:42:16.760
And then if I give you
this node and this node,

00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:18.950
I want to know that this
node is before that node

00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:21.710
in the list in constant time.

00:42:21.710 --> 00:42:25.250
I claim that we can solve this
problem given our solutions

00:42:25.250 --> 00:42:28.250
to list labeling--

00:42:28.250 --> 00:42:31.840
not so obvious, how.

00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:33.784
List labeling is
great because it lets

00:42:33.784 --> 00:42:34.950
you do order queries, right?

00:42:34.950 --> 00:42:37.130
You just compare the two
labels and you instantly

00:42:37.130 --> 00:42:39.680
discover which is before which.

00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:41.840
And so if we could afford
log N time over there,

00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:43.820
we could just use this solution.

00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:45.420
And this is reasonable.

00:42:45.420 --> 00:42:48.140
But we really want constant
time per operation.

00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:49.880
Now if we do constant
time per operation

00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:52.410
and we use exponential
label space,

00:42:52.410 --> 00:42:54.310
this is not so good
because it means you need

00:42:54.310 --> 00:42:56.540
N bits to write down a label.

00:42:56.540 --> 00:42:58.940
So it's going to take,
like, linear time to modify

00:42:58.940 --> 00:43:02.000
or to compare two labels.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.540
This doesn't save you.

00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:05.870
We can afford to do this.

00:43:05.870 --> 00:43:08.900
This is only log
N bits per label.

00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:10.760
And we assume all
of our integers

00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:13.190
can store at least log N bits--

00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:16.740
something called
a Word RAM Model.

00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:19.970
And so we can afford
to store these labels,

00:43:19.970 --> 00:43:22.140
but we pay this log N time.

00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:24.560
So you've got to
remove a log N factor.

00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:25.750
How do we do that?

00:43:25.750 --> 00:43:28.610
Indirection-- just
like last class.

00:43:34.230 --> 00:43:35.710
Let's do that on this board.

00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:55.670
On the top, we're going to
store N over log N items

00:43:55.670 --> 00:44:11.680
using this list labeling with
label space, say, N squared.

00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:13.420
Any polynomial will do.

00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:15.560
And so this takes
log N per operation

00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:18.480
to do anything on these
N over log N items.

00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:20.030
And then at the
bottom, we have lots

00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:23.000
of little structures
of size log N.

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:25.910
And that's supposed to eat up
a factor of log N in our update

00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:27.130
time if we do it right.

00:44:35.030 --> 00:44:38.670
Actually, I can just do list
labeling down here as well.

00:44:38.670 --> 00:44:41.840
So if I'm only
storing log N items,

00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:44.960
then I can afford to use
the exponential solution--

00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:48.770
the trivial thing where I just
bisect all the labels until all

00:44:48.770 --> 00:44:50.480
the log items have changed.

00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:51.680
Then, rewrite them.

00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:56.000
Because 2 to the log N is only
N. So here, in each of these,

00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:04.370
I do a list labeling with
space 2 to the log N,

00:45:04.370 --> 00:45:06.800
also known as N.

00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:10.920
So these guys are constant
time to do anything in

00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:12.500
to maintain the labels.

00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:14.420
And to maintain levels up here--

00:45:14.420 --> 00:45:17.750
so to maintain, basically, each
of these N over log N guys,

00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:22.210
is one representative element
representing this entire group

00:45:22.210 --> 00:45:24.050
as N over log N of these groups.

00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:28.790
So this label
structure is supposed

00:45:28.790 --> 00:45:30.770
to distinguish the
different groups.

00:45:30.770 --> 00:45:34.340
And then the labels in here
are distinguishing the items

00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:35.270
within the group.

00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:41.620
Now this cost log N amortized
to keep what we need up here.

00:45:41.620 --> 00:45:44.180
But now if I want
the label of an item,

00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:49.030
I just take this label,
comma, this label.

00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:52.290
So if I have an item
here, for example,

00:45:52.290 --> 00:45:54.620
at first, I look at
the label of this block

00:45:54.620 --> 00:45:57.000
as stored by this
data structure.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.180
And then I look at the
label within the block.

00:45:59.180 --> 00:46:05.690
And so my composite
label is going

00:46:05.690 --> 00:46:12.020
to be an ordered pair of top
label, comma, the bottom label.

00:46:18.017 --> 00:46:19.600
This is kind of funny
because it looks

00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:22.030
like we're solving the list
labeling problem again,

00:46:22.030 --> 00:46:25.030
with now a space of N cubed.

00:46:25.030 --> 00:46:27.760
We've got N squared for
the first coordinate,

00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:29.471
and then N for the
second coordinate.

00:46:29.471 --> 00:46:30.970
So if you just
concatenate those two

00:46:30.970 --> 00:46:35.740
labels, that lives in a bigger
label space of size N cubed.

00:46:35.740 --> 00:46:38.520
And yet, I claim this
takes constant amortized

00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:40.750
and is not a solution
to list labeling.

00:46:40.750 --> 00:46:44.560
It's just a matter of, again,
how updates are performed.

00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:47.260
With order file maintenance, we
had to physically move items.

00:46:47.260 --> 00:46:49.330
With list labeling
problem, we had

00:46:49.330 --> 00:46:52.450
to modify the number
stored with each node.

00:46:52.450 --> 00:46:54.010
That's expensive.

00:46:54.010 --> 00:46:58.570
In this world, if we
change a label up here,

00:46:58.570 --> 00:47:00.970
we are basically
instantly-- say,

00:47:00.970 --> 00:47:04.450
we changed the label
corresponding to this group

00:47:04.450 --> 00:47:05.500
in here.

00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:09.070
We changed the label all of
these items in one operation.

00:47:09.070 --> 00:47:11.170
Or actually, it
takes log N time.

00:47:11.170 --> 00:47:14.060
And then we change the label
of all log N of these items.

00:47:14.060 --> 00:47:17.080
So that's why we get
constant amortized.

00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:18.440
So how does this work?

00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:20.230
If we insert a new
item, we stick it

00:47:20.230 --> 00:47:22.240
into one of these blocks.

00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:23.920
The block that it fits into.

00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:27.850
If this block gets too full,
more than, say, 1 times log N,

00:47:27.850 --> 00:47:29.260
then we split it in half.

00:47:29.260 --> 00:47:32.410
If it gets too sparse by
deletion, say, less than a 1/4

00:47:32.410 --> 00:47:35.080
log N, then we'll merge it
with one of its neighbors,

00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:36.550
and then possibly split.

00:47:36.550 --> 00:47:38.800
Each of those triggers a
constant number of operations

00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:39.900
up here.

00:47:39.900 --> 00:47:41.920
And so we pay log N,
but we only pay it

00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:45.850
when we've made theta log N
changes to one of these blocks.

00:47:45.850 --> 00:47:49.150
So we can charge this log N
cost to those log N updates.

00:47:49.150 --> 00:47:50.770
And so this turns into constant.

00:47:50.770 --> 00:47:52.670
This down here is
always constant.

00:47:52.670 --> 00:47:54.671
And so it's constant amortized.

00:48:02.530 --> 00:48:05.410
And if each of these
blocks remembers

00:48:05.410 --> 00:48:07.480
what the corresponding--

00:48:07.480 --> 00:48:09.370
and, basically, this
is a linked list, here.

00:48:09.370 --> 00:48:10.994
And then we have
linked list down here,

00:48:10.994 --> 00:48:12.400
and they have labels.

00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:15.940
And it's like a, what do you
call, a skip list with just two

00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:17.110
levels.

00:48:17.110 --> 00:48:18.820
And every node
here just remembers

00:48:18.820 --> 00:48:20.527
what its parent is up here.

00:48:20.527 --> 00:48:22.360
So if you want to know
your composite label,

00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:25.660
you just look at the bottom
label and then walk up.

00:48:25.660 --> 00:48:27.010
Look at the top label.

00:48:27.010 --> 00:48:29.140
Those are just stored
right there in the nodes.

00:48:29.140 --> 00:48:31.348
And so in constant time,
you can find your top label,

00:48:31.348 --> 00:48:32.200
your bottom label.

00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:35.210
Therefore, you can compare
two items in constant time.

00:48:35.210 --> 00:48:37.380
So this solves the problem
we needed in Lecture 1.

00:48:37.380 --> 00:48:37.879
Question?

00:48:37.879 --> 00:48:41.708
AUDIENCE: Sorry, why isn't it
the same as the N cubed label

00:48:41.708 --> 00:48:42.210
space?

00:48:42.210 --> 00:48:42.918
ERIK DEMAINE: OK.

00:48:42.918 --> 00:48:45.880
Why is it not same as N cubed
label space, which I claim

00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:47.770
has a lower amount of log N?

00:48:47.770 --> 00:48:50.650
The difference is
with list labeling,

00:48:50.650 --> 00:48:53.590
you have to explicitly change
the label of each items.

00:48:53.590 --> 00:48:55.990
And here, we're
basically computing

00:48:55.990 --> 00:48:58.492
the label of a node now becomes
a constant time algorithm.

00:48:58.492 --> 00:48:59.950
We're allowed to
look at the label,

00:48:59.950 --> 00:49:02.014
here, then walk up, then
look at the label, here.

00:49:02.014 --> 00:49:03.430
And by changing
the label up here,

00:49:03.430 --> 00:49:06.550
we change it simultaneously
for log N guys down there.

00:49:06.550 --> 00:49:09.400
So that's the big difference
between this list order

00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:13.000
maintenance problem from
the list labeling problem.

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:15.010
These were actually all
solved in the same paper

00:49:15.010 --> 00:49:16.540
by Dietz and Slater.

00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:20.200
But sort of successively--

00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:21.731
slightly relaxing
on a problem makes

00:49:21.731 --> 00:49:23.980
a huge difference in the
running time you can achieve.

00:49:23.980 --> 00:49:26.021
Obviously, we can't get
any better than constant.

00:49:26.021 --> 00:49:28.407
So we're done in--

00:49:28.407 --> 00:49:30.490
of course, then there's
external memory versions--

00:49:30.490 --> 00:49:36.350
but in terms of regular
data structures.

00:49:36.350 --> 00:49:41.200
And again, Willard made
it worst case constant.

00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:43.800
That's a lot harder.

00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:46.661
Other questions?

00:49:46.661 --> 00:49:47.160
Cool.

00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:52.260
So that does order file
maintenance and list labeling.

00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:55.210
And so next, we're going to
move to a very different data

00:49:55.210 --> 00:49:57.520
structure, which is
cache-oblivious priority queue.

00:50:09.912 --> 00:50:11.870
We haven't really done
any cache-oblivious data

00:50:11.870 --> 00:50:12.536
structures, yet.

00:50:12.536 --> 00:50:15.710
So it's time to return
to our original goal.

00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:21.820
We're not actually going
to use ordered files.

00:50:21.820 --> 00:50:23.800
Sadly, that was last lecture.

00:50:26.644 --> 00:50:30.550
So All of this was a
continuation of last lecture.

00:50:30.550 --> 00:50:32.770
Now we're going to do a
different data structure.

00:50:32.770 --> 00:50:34.270
It's going to adapt
to B, it's going

00:50:34.270 --> 00:50:36.170
to adapt to M. It's
cache-oblivious.

00:50:36.170 --> 00:50:38.080
And it achieves priority queue.

00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:40.120
Now remember, this
sorting bound--

00:50:44.830 --> 00:50:49.120
N over B log base M of N over
B This is our sorting bound.

00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:53.270
Then the priority queue bound
we want is this divided by N.

00:50:53.270 --> 00:50:57.520
So we want to be able to
do 1 over B log base M

00:50:57.520 --> 00:51:01.990
over B, N over b.

00:51:01.990 --> 00:51:05.920
Insert and delete
min, let's say.

00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:08.290
And this is an interesting
bound because it's usually

00:51:08.290 --> 00:51:10.060
much less than 1.

00:51:10.060 --> 00:51:11.990
It's a sub constant bound.

00:51:11.990 --> 00:51:14.740
This is going to
be a little o of 1,

00:51:14.740 --> 00:51:20.530
assuming this log is
smaller than this B.

00:51:20.530 --> 00:51:30.190
So it's a little o of
1 if, let's say, B is

00:51:30.190 --> 00:51:33.620
bigger than the log N, roughly.

00:51:33.620 --> 00:51:37.390
This would, in
particular, be enough.

00:51:37.390 --> 00:51:39.820
No pun intended-- be enough.

00:51:39.820 --> 00:51:43.030
So if our block size
is reasonably big--

00:51:43.030 --> 00:51:45.035
cache line is bigger
than log N, which

00:51:45.035 --> 00:51:48.550
is probably most likely
in typical caches

00:51:48.550 --> 00:51:49.900
and architectures--

00:51:49.900 --> 00:51:54.420
then this is more like 1
over B, never mind the log.

00:51:54.420 --> 00:51:57.970
And so we have to do B
operations in one step.

00:51:57.970 --> 00:52:00.250
And then to really
get the log right,

00:52:00.250 --> 00:52:10.690
we have to depend
on M, not just B.

00:52:10.690 --> 00:52:16.300
As I mentioned, that's the
bound we're going to achieve.

00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:18.700
We do need to make an
assumption about M and B

00:52:18.700 --> 00:52:20.420
and how they relate.

00:52:20.420 --> 00:52:31.250
So we're going to assume a
tall cache, which is M is,

00:52:31.250 --> 00:52:35.230
let's say, B to
the 1 plus epsilon.

00:52:35.230 --> 00:52:38.380
So it has to be substantially
bigger than B, not

00:52:38.380 --> 00:52:39.475
by a huge amount.

00:52:39.475 --> 00:52:40.600
It could be B squared.

00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:42.910
It could be B to the 1.1 power.

00:52:42.910 --> 00:52:45.242
But M is definitely
at least B. And I want

00:52:45.242 --> 00:52:46.450
it to be a little bit bigger.

00:52:46.450 --> 00:52:49.420
I want the number of
blocks to be not so tiny.

00:52:53.537 --> 00:52:54.370
Here's how we do it.

00:53:19.940 --> 00:53:22.670
I think I need a big picture.

00:53:29.260 --> 00:53:32.010
So the kind of funny thing about
cache-oblivious priority queues

00:53:32.010 --> 00:53:33.445
is we're not going to use trees.

00:53:36.190 --> 00:53:40.090
It's basically a bunch of
arrays in a linear order.

00:53:42.814 --> 00:53:45.670
In some ways, it's an
easier data structure.

00:53:45.670 --> 00:53:48.056
But it's definitely
more complicated.

00:53:52.030 --> 00:53:54.786
But, hey, it's
faster than b-trees.

00:53:54.786 --> 00:53:57.160
If you don't need to be able
to do searches-- if you just

00:53:57.160 --> 00:53:59.770
need to be able to delete
min, then priority queues

00:53:59.770 --> 00:54:01.810
are a lot faster than b-trees.

00:54:10.206 --> 00:54:11.330
Let me draw this.

00:54:24.420 --> 00:54:28.500
I want to try to draw
this pseudo-accurate size.

00:54:51.132 --> 00:54:53.230
The only part that's
inaccurate about this picture

00:54:53.230 --> 00:54:55.050
is the dot dot dots.

00:54:55.050 --> 00:54:56.100
Lets me cheat a little.

00:55:09.160 --> 00:55:19.440
So we have x to that
9/4, x to the 3/2 and x.

00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:24.260
This is sort of what the
levels are going to look like.

00:55:24.260 --> 00:55:26.510
So we have a linear
sequence of levels.

00:55:26.510 --> 00:55:32.090
They are increasing doubly
exponentially in size.

00:55:32.090 --> 00:55:34.840
If you look at what's
going on here--

00:55:38.137 --> 00:55:38.970
double exponential--

00:55:38.970 --> 00:55:39.926
AUDIENCE: Are those
exponentials the same as those?

00:55:39.926 --> 00:55:41.014
Or are they inverted?

00:55:41.014 --> 00:55:42.680
ERIK DEMAINE: It's
supposed to be this--

00:55:42.680 --> 00:55:47.400
so this is the top level,
and this is the bottom level.

00:55:51.100 --> 00:55:54.060
So at the top, we're going
to have something of size N.

00:55:54.060 --> 00:55:56.620
And at the bottom, we're going
to have something of a size C,

00:55:56.620 --> 00:55:57.770
constant.

00:55:57.770 --> 00:56:00.370
And what I've drawn is
the generic middle part.

00:56:00.370 --> 00:56:03.400
So we go from x, to x
to 3/2, to x to the 9/4.

00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:06.520
Or you could say x to the
9/4, down to x to the 3/2,

00:56:06.520 --> 00:56:12.040
down to x, according to
this exponential geometric

00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:13.610
progression, I guess.

00:56:13.610 --> 00:56:16.610
So that's how they go.

00:56:16.610 --> 00:56:18.970
So I mean, if it was
just exponential,

00:56:18.970 --> 00:56:21.580
it would be, like, N,
N over 2, N over 4.

00:56:21.580 --> 00:56:23.950
But we're doing--
in logarithms, we're

00:56:23.950 --> 00:56:25.200
changing by constant factors.

00:56:25.200 --> 00:56:28.120
So it's doubly exponential.

00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:30.700
And then each of the
levels is decomposed

00:56:30.700 --> 00:56:33.810
into top buffers and bottom--

00:56:33.810 --> 00:56:37.120
or, sorry, up buffers
and down buffers.

00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:39.820
And as you see, the
size of the top buffer

00:56:39.820 --> 00:56:43.600
is equal to the sum of the
sizes of the bottom buffers.

00:56:43.600 --> 00:56:48.920
So let me elaborate
on how this works.

00:56:48.920 --> 00:56:53.770
It's level x to the 3/2.

00:56:53.770 --> 00:56:56.500
We're going to, generically,
be looking at x to the 3/2.

00:56:56.500 --> 00:56:57.550
So I can easily go down.

00:56:57.550 --> 00:56:58.390
That's of size x.

00:56:58.390 --> 00:57:00.945
And up is x to the 9/4--

00:57:00.945 --> 00:57:01.445
easily.

00:57:04.660 --> 00:57:15.325
There's always one up
buffer of size x to the 3/2.

00:57:17.840 --> 00:57:19.850
So maybe some color.

00:57:22.410 --> 00:57:27.420
So this buffer, here,
is x to the 3/2.

00:57:27.420 --> 00:57:43.200
And then we also have up to x
to the 1/2 down buffers, each

00:57:43.200 --> 00:57:46.185
of size theta x.

00:57:49.750 --> 00:57:51.920
Each of these guys
has size theta x.

00:57:55.700 --> 00:58:00.382
And then the number of them
is, at most, x to the 1/2.

00:58:00.382 --> 00:58:01.840
And so you take
the product, that's

00:58:01.840 --> 00:58:04.810
x to 3/2, which is the
same as the up buffer.

00:58:04.810 --> 00:58:08.260
So that's the way
this cookie crumbles.

00:58:08.260 --> 00:58:12.460
That's how each of these guys
decomposes into little pieces.

00:58:12.460 --> 00:58:15.550
And so, in particular, this
up buffer, if you work it out,

00:58:15.550 --> 00:58:19.180
should be exactly the same
size as this down buffer.

00:58:19.180 --> 00:58:21.250
Maybe it's easier
to do these two.

00:58:21.250 --> 00:58:24.250
So this down buffer has size x.

00:58:24.250 --> 00:58:28.070
And if you have a structure size
x, the up buffer has size x.

00:58:28.070 --> 00:58:30.850
x of 3/2 has an up
buffer size of x 3/2.

00:58:30.850 --> 00:58:32.230
So this will be size x.

00:58:32.230 --> 00:58:35.220
And so these match.

00:58:35.220 --> 00:58:36.170
These are equal size.

00:58:36.170 --> 00:58:37.420
That's why I drew it this way.

00:58:40.630 --> 00:58:43.500
Now the dot dot dot hides the
fact that they're x to the 1/2

00:58:43.500 --> 00:58:44.000
of these.

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:45.422
So there's a lot
of down buffers.

00:58:45.422 --> 00:58:47.380
They're actually a lot
smaller than up buffers.

00:58:47.380 --> 00:58:50.040
But these two match in
size and these two match

00:58:50.040 --> 00:58:50.860
in size, and so on.

00:58:59.370 --> 00:59:02.040
OK, there's a small exception.

00:59:02.040 --> 00:59:04.940
I'd put theta x here.

00:59:04.940 --> 00:59:08.220
The exception is that the
very first down buffer

00:59:08.220 --> 00:59:10.890
might be mostly empty.

00:59:10.890 --> 00:59:13.890
So this one is not
actually data x.

00:59:13.890 --> 00:59:16.380
Each of these will be theta x.

00:59:16.380 --> 00:59:19.490
And this one over on the
left will be big O of x.

00:59:22.300 --> 00:59:25.139
Small typo in the notes, here.

00:59:31.010 --> 00:59:35.599
So if that's not sufficiently
messy, let me redraw it--

00:59:35.599 --> 00:59:36.640
make it a little cleaner.

01:00:00.060 --> 01:00:03.360
I want to look at two
consecutive levels

01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:06.260
and specify invariants.

01:00:12.001 --> 01:00:14.250
So after all, I'm trying to
maintain a priority queue.

01:00:14.250 --> 01:00:16.500
What the heck is this thing?

01:00:16.500 --> 01:00:18.630
The idea is that
towards the bottom,

01:00:18.630 --> 01:00:20.760
that's where the min is.

01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:22.950
That would seem good,
because at the bottom,

01:00:22.950 --> 01:00:24.330
you're constant size.

01:00:24.330 --> 01:00:26.175
I can diddle with the
thing of constant size

01:00:26.175 --> 01:00:28.500
if fits in a block
or if it's in cache.

01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:31.890
It takes me zero time to
touch things near the bottom.

01:00:31.890 --> 01:00:34.530
So as long as I always
keep the min down there,

01:00:34.530 --> 01:00:36.960
I can do fine min in zero time.

01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:39.450
And delete min will
also be pretty fast.

01:00:39.450 --> 01:00:41.910
I'm also going to insert
there, because I don't

01:00:41.910 --> 01:00:43.200
know where else to put it.

01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:45.630
I'd like the larger items
to be at near the top.

01:00:45.630 --> 01:00:48.060
I'd like the smaller items
to be near the bottom,

01:00:48.060 --> 01:00:51.480
but kind of hard to know,
when I insert an item,

01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:52.500
where it belongs.

01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:54.420
So I'll just start by
inserting at the bottom.

01:00:54.420 --> 01:00:58.500
And the idea is as I insert,
insert, insert down here,

01:00:58.500 --> 01:01:00.030
things will start to trickle up.

01:01:00.030 --> 01:01:03.970
That's what the up arrows mean,
that these items are moving up.

01:01:03.970 --> 01:01:08.570
And then down arrow items are
items that are moving down.

01:01:08.570 --> 01:01:09.820
Somehow this is going to work.

01:01:09.820 --> 01:01:11.930
So let me tell
you the invariants

01:01:11.930 --> 01:01:14.190
that will make this work.

01:01:14.190 --> 01:01:18.300
If you look at the down
buffers, they are sorted.

01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:19.920
Or I should say, all
the items in here

01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:23.010
are less than all the
items in here, and so on.

01:01:23.010 --> 01:01:27.270
But within each down
buffer, it's disordered.

01:01:27.270 --> 01:01:36.290
Then we also know this.

01:01:36.290 --> 01:01:38.580
All the items in the up
buffer in a given level--

01:01:38.580 --> 01:01:42.175
this is x to the 3/2, let's say.

01:01:42.175 --> 01:01:44.960
And this is x.

01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:50.930
All of the up items are larger
than all of the down items.

01:01:50.930 --> 01:01:53.805
I mean, it's just
an inequality here.

01:01:53.805 --> 01:01:55.430
So these guys are
basically in a chain.

01:01:55.430 --> 01:01:58.006
Again, the items in
here are not sorted.

01:01:58.006 --> 01:02:00.380
But all the items here are
bigger than all the items here

01:02:00.380 --> 01:02:01.610
are bigger than all
of the items here are

01:02:01.610 --> 01:02:02.901
bigger than all the items here.

01:02:02.901 --> 01:02:05.510
Now what about from
level to level?

01:02:05.510 --> 01:02:07.730
This is a little more subtle.

01:02:07.730 --> 01:02:10.880
What we know is this.

01:02:14.089 --> 01:02:16.380
So again, we know that all
the down buffers are sorted.

01:02:16.380 --> 01:02:17.796
And we know that
this down buffer,

01:02:17.796 --> 01:02:20.820
all these items come before
all this down buffer items.

01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:23.140
But these up buffer
items, we don't know yet,

01:02:23.140 --> 01:02:24.780
because they're still moving up.

01:02:24.780 --> 01:02:27.130
Now we know this.

01:02:27.130 --> 01:02:28.362
They need to move up.

01:02:28.362 --> 01:02:29.820
But we still don't
know how far up.

01:02:29.820 --> 01:02:32.028
We don't know how these
items compare to these items.

01:02:32.028 --> 01:02:34.590
Or these items could
have to go higher,

01:02:34.590 --> 01:02:38.260
could be they belong here,
or are here, who knows.

01:02:38.260 --> 01:02:41.280
So basically, the down buffers
are more or less sorted.

01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:43.440
And so the mins are going
to be down at the bottom.

01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:45.889
And the up buffer items, I
mean, they're still moving up.

01:02:45.889 --> 01:02:47.430
We don't know where
they belong, yet.

01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:49.054
But eventually they'll
find their place

01:02:49.054 --> 01:02:50.730
and start trickling down.

01:02:50.730 --> 01:02:53.001
Roughly speaking, an item
will go up for a while

01:02:53.001 --> 01:02:54.000
and then come back down.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.320
Although, that's
not literally true.

01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:56.070
It's roughly true.

01:03:01.100 --> 01:03:04.760
I should say something
about how we actually

01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:08.240
store this in memory, because
the whole name of the game

01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:10.720
is how you lay
things out in memory.

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:13.220
In cache-oblivious, that's all
you get to choose, basically.

01:03:13.220 --> 01:03:16.700
The rest is algorithm,
regular RAM algorithm.

01:03:16.700 --> 01:03:18.680
And all we do is store
the items in order,

01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:20.150
say, from bottom to top.

01:03:20.150 --> 01:03:22.400
So store the entire C
level, then the next level

01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:25.835
up, to store these items
as consecutive arrays.

01:03:25.835 --> 01:03:28.190
That's what we need to.

01:03:28.190 --> 01:03:30.800
Leave enough space for x to
the 1/2 down buffers, each

01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:32.260
at size theta x.

01:03:54.430 --> 01:03:59.840
So how do we do
inserts and deletes?

01:04:06.814 --> 01:04:10.330
Let's start with insert.

01:04:10.330 --> 01:04:13.695
As I mentioned, we want to start
by inserting in the bottom,

01:04:13.695 --> 01:04:15.320
until we run out of
room in the bottom.

01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:17.780
And then things
have to trickle up.

01:04:17.780 --> 01:04:19.583
So here's the basic algorithm.

01:04:32.770 --> 01:04:34.540
You look at the bottom level.

01:04:34.540 --> 01:04:38.030
You stick the item
into the up buffer.

01:04:38.030 --> 01:04:40.052
This is not necessarily
the right thing to do.

01:04:40.052 --> 01:04:41.760
So here, you stick it
into the up buffer.

01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:44.390
But these things are supposed
to be roughly sorted.

01:04:44.390 --> 01:04:46.780
So once you stick it there,
you say, oh, well maybe I

01:04:46.780 --> 01:04:48.080
have to go down here.

01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:48.901
Go down here.

01:04:48.901 --> 01:04:50.650
The point is the up
buffer is the only one

01:04:50.650 --> 01:04:52.750
I want to be growing in size.

01:04:52.750 --> 01:04:54.430
So I insert into the up buffer.

01:04:54.430 --> 01:04:57.370
And say, oh, potentially
I have to swap down here.

01:04:57.370 --> 01:04:58.490
Swap down here.

01:04:58.490 --> 01:04:59.740
I mean, this is constant size.

01:04:59.740 --> 01:05:03.370
I can afford to look at all
the items here in zero time

01:05:03.370 --> 01:05:05.620
and find out which
buffer it belongs to.

01:05:05.620 --> 01:05:07.840
As I move the item
down here, I swap.

01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:11.060
So I take the max item here
and move it up to here.

01:05:11.060 --> 01:05:13.510
Move the max item from
the next down buffer

01:05:13.510 --> 01:05:16.630
and propagate it up, so that
I keep these things in order.

01:05:22.530 --> 01:05:34.030
Swap into bottom down
buffers if necessary--

01:05:36.730 --> 01:05:38.110
or maybe, as necessary.

01:05:38.110 --> 01:05:39.909
You might have to
do a bunch of swaps.

01:05:39.909 --> 01:05:40.825
But it's all constant.

01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:47.230
And then the point
is the only buffer

01:05:47.230 --> 01:05:50.260
that got larger by one item was
the up buffer, because, here,

01:05:50.260 --> 01:05:52.480
we did swaps to preserve size.

01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:55.668
And if that overflows, then
we do something interesting.

01:05:59.580 --> 01:06:02.250
And something interesting
is called push.

01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:11.720
This is a separate team,
which I'll define now.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.040
So this is the
bottom level push.

01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:33.770
But I wanted to find the
generic level of push, which

01:06:33.770 --> 01:06:41.150
is we're going to be pushing
x elements into level x

01:06:41.150 --> 01:06:41.715
to the 3/2.

01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:51.150
So why is that?

01:06:51.150 --> 01:06:52.320
Check it out.

01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:56.104
If we're at level x and
our up buffer overflows,

01:06:56.104 --> 01:06:58.020
and we're trying to push
into the next level--

01:06:58.020 --> 01:06:59.970
that's level x to 3/2--

01:06:59.970 --> 01:07:05.435
then the up buffer that we're
trying to push has size x.

01:07:05.435 --> 01:07:09.180
The up buffer has the same
size as the level name.

01:07:09.180 --> 01:07:11.190
So if we're at level
x, this has size x.

01:07:11.190 --> 01:07:13.780
We're trying to push x items
up into the next thing.

01:07:18.215 --> 01:07:19.840
We're going to empty
out the up buffer.

01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:21.230
Send all those items up there.

01:07:24.330 --> 01:07:24.990
Cool.

01:07:24.990 --> 01:07:25.770
So what do we do?

01:07:25.770 --> 01:07:27.390
How do we do this push?

01:07:27.390 --> 01:07:31.590
First thing we do
is sort the items--

01:07:31.590 --> 01:07:33.570
those x items.

01:07:33.570 --> 01:07:36.300
This is where I need
the black box, which

01:07:36.300 --> 01:07:39.000
is that we can sort
N over B log base N

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.340
over B, N over B
cache-obliviously.

01:07:41.340 --> 01:07:45.480
So we're going to use that here.

01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:48.810
It's not hard, but I don't
want to spend time on it.

01:07:48.810 --> 01:07:54.480
Now the interesting bit
is how we do the push.

01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:57.000
The tricky part is we
have all these items,

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.479
we know that they're bigger
than all the items below them.

01:07:59.479 --> 01:08:00.770
Maybe, here's a better picture.

01:08:00.770 --> 01:08:02.370
We know these guys
need to go up.

01:08:02.370 --> 01:08:06.300
They're bigger than everything,
all the down items below us.

01:08:06.300 --> 01:08:07.800
But we don't know,
does it fit here?

01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:08.450
Here?

01:08:08.450 --> 01:08:08.950
Here?

01:08:08.950 --> 01:08:10.605
Or here?

01:08:10.605 --> 01:08:12.480
But we do know that
these things are ordered.

01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:14.850
And so if we sort these
items, then we can say,

01:08:14.850 --> 01:08:16.859
well, let's start
by looking here.

01:08:16.859 --> 01:08:18.990
Do any of these items
fit in this block?

01:08:18.990 --> 01:08:20.790
Just look at the max, here.

01:08:20.790 --> 01:08:23.850
And if these guys are
smaller than the max, here,

01:08:23.850 --> 01:08:24.819
then they belong here.

01:08:24.819 --> 01:08:26.430
So keep inserting there.

01:08:26.430 --> 01:08:29.279
Eventually, we'll get bigger
than the max, then we go here.

01:08:29.279 --> 01:08:30.649
Look at the max item, here.

01:08:30.649 --> 01:08:33.107
As long as we have items here
that are smaller than the max

01:08:33.107 --> 01:08:36.810
here, insert, insert,
insert, insert, and so on.

01:08:36.810 --> 01:08:39.396
And then when we're beyond
all of these-- maybe

01:08:39.396 --> 01:08:40.979
we're immediately
beyond all of these.

01:08:40.979 --> 01:08:42.359
We have to check, oh,
bigger than the max,

01:08:42.359 --> 01:08:44.100
bigger than the max,
bigger than the max.

01:08:44.100 --> 01:08:48.370
Then we put all the remaining
items into the up buffer.

01:08:48.370 --> 01:08:50.025
This is called distribution.

01:09:11.390 --> 01:09:14.670
So we're looking at
level x to the 3/2,

01:09:14.670 --> 01:09:17.103
and just scanning sequentially.

01:09:21.740 --> 01:09:25.340
Because we just sorted them,
we're scanning them in order.

01:09:25.340 --> 01:09:28.640
We visit the down
buffers in order.

01:09:38.460 --> 01:09:41.160
And insert into the appropriate
down buffer as we go.

01:09:43.740 --> 01:09:46.950
Now there's a little bit
that can happen, here.

01:09:46.950 --> 01:09:49.710
Our down buffers
have a limit in size.

01:09:49.710 --> 01:09:53.010
Down buffers are supposed to
have size theta x at level

01:09:53.010 --> 01:09:54.279
x the 3/2.

01:09:54.279 --> 01:09:57.480
So as we're inserting into here,
a down buffer might overflow.

01:09:57.480 --> 01:09:58.680
I've got theta slop, here.

01:09:58.680 --> 01:10:02.100
So when a down buffer overflows,
I just split it in half.

01:10:02.100 --> 01:10:04.254
I then make two down buffers.

01:10:04.254 --> 01:10:05.670
Well, actually,
it would be, like,

01:10:05.670 --> 01:10:07.440
here and right next to it.

01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:10.920
I'm going to maintain a
linked list of down buffers.

01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:14.470
And each of them will have
space for say, 2x items.

01:10:14.470 --> 01:10:19.140
But once I do a split,
they'll both be half full.

01:10:19.140 --> 01:10:40.670
So when a down buffer
overflows, split in half

01:10:40.670 --> 01:10:43.700
and maintain a linked
list of down buffers.

01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:51.700
Another thing that can happen
is when you increase the number

01:10:51.700 --> 01:10:54.230
down buffers, we have a limit
on how many down buffers

01:10:54.230 --> 01:10:55.190
we can have--

01:10:55.190 --> 01:10:57.680
up to x the 1/2 of them.

01:10:57.680 --> 01:11:00.380
So if we run out of down
buffers by splitting,

01:11:00.380 --> 01:11:03.000
then we need to start
using the up buffer.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:08.860
So maybe here, we split,
maybe, this buffer--

01:11:08.860 --> 01:11:10.805
is now too many
down buffers total.

01:11:10.805 --> 01:11:12.680
Then we'll just take
all the elements in here

01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:15.290
and stick them into the
up buffer, because that's

01:11:15.290 --> 01:11:18.030
where they belong.

01:11:18.030 --> 01:11:20.840
So when the number
of down buffers

01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:31.600
is too big, when that
number overflows,

01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:42.720
move the last down buffer
into the up buffer.

01:11:46.972 --> 01:11:49.180
So there's basically two
ways that elements are going

01:11:49.180 --> 01:11:50.470
to get into the up buffer.

01:11:50.470 --> 01:11:52.300
One way is that we run
out of down buffers,

01:11:52.300 --> 01:11:54.220
and so the last down
buffer starts getting

01:11:54.220 --> 01:11:56.632
promoted into the up buffer.

01:11:56.632 --> 01:11:58.090
The other possibility
is that we're

01:11:58.090 --> 01:12:01.460
inserting items that are
just really big in value.

01:12:01.460 --> 01:12:03.460
And if the items
that are getting

01:12:03.460 --> 01:12:05.230
promoted from here
into the next level

01:12:05.230 --> 01:12:07.430
just happen to be larger
than all these items,

01:12:07.430 --> 01:12:09.790
we will immediately start
inserting into the up buffer.

01:12:09.790 --> 01:12:11.830
But in general, we have to
look at this down buffer.

01:12:11.830 --> 01:12:12.538
Look at this one.

01:12:12.538 --> 01:12:16.300
Look at this one, then that one.

01:12:16.300 --> 01:12:18.070
That is insert and push.

01:12:18.070 --> 01:12:21.010
I think before I
talk about delete,

01:12:21.010 --> 01:12:23.170
I'd like to talk about the
analysis of just insert

01:12:23.170 --> 01:12:24.040
and push.

01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:25.720
Keep it simple.

01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:28.120
And then I'll briefly
tell you about deletion.

01:12:51.620 --> 01:12:52.550
Oh, I didn't say.

01:12:52.550 --> 01:12:53.210
Sorry.

01:12:53.210 --> 01:12:55.307
There's one more step,
which is the recursion.

01:12:57.990 --> 01:12:59.450
Running out a room, here.

01:12:59.450 --> 01:13:01.394
Maybe I'll go over here.

01:13:01.394 --> 01:13:02.435
This is nothing relevant.

01:13:11.112 --> 01:13:12.320
So I need to recurse somehow.

01:13:15.890 --> 01:13:18.740
At some point, inserting things
into the up offer, the up

01:13:18.740 --> 01:13:19.760
buffer might overflow.

01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:21.980
That's the one last thing
that could overflow.

01:13:21.980 --> 01:13:24.680
When that happens, I just
push it to the next level up.

01:13:52.030 --> 01:13:55.487
So as we do
insertions in here, we

01:13:55.487 --> 01:13:57.070
might start inserting
a lot into here.

01:13:57.070 --> 01:13:58.486
Eventually, this
will get too big.

01:13:58.486 --> 01:14:00.200
It's supposed to
have size x the 3/2.

01:14:00.200 --> 01:14:02.350
If it gets bigger than
that, take all these items

01:14:02.350 --> 01:14:05.620
and just recursively push
them up to the next level.

01:14:05.620 --> 01:14:08.010
And conveniently, that's
exactly the same size

01:14:08.010 --> 01:14:09.010
as we were doing before.

01:14:09.010 --> 01:14:11.690
Here, we did x into
level x to the 3/2.

01:14:11.690 --> 01:14:16.646
Next will be x to the 3/2 into
level x to the 9/4, and so on.

01:14:16.646 --> 01:14:18.020
Always the size
of the up buffer.

01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:25.300
So the claim is if we
look at the push at level

01:14:25.300 --> 01:14:26.260
x to the 3/2--

01:14:26.260 --> 01:14:29.680
which is what we
just described--

01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:31.990
and we ignore the recursion.

01:14:40.910 --> 01:14:51.560
Then the cost is x over B log
base M over B of x over B--

01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:54.590
so sorting bound on x items.

01:14:54.590 --> 01:14:57.800
So we spend that right away
in the very first step.

01:14:57.800 --> 01:15:00.050
We sort x items.

01:15:00.050 --> 01:15:04.592
So that costs x over B. It has
log base M over B of x over B.

01:15:04.592 --> 01:15:06.050
And the whole point
of the analysis

01:15:06.050 --> 01:15:09.380
is to show that this
distribution step doesn't cost

01:15:09.380 --> 01:15:11.120
any more than the sorting step.

01:15:14.180 --> 01:15:19.220
So let's prove this claim.

01:15:19.220 --> 01:15:23.120
And the first
observation-- maybe,

01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:24.830
don't even need to
write this down.

01:15:24.830 --> 01:15:27.392
So remember, with
cache-oblivious b-trees,

01:15:27.392 --> 01:15:28.850
we looked at a
level of detail that

01:15:28.850 --> 01:15:30.224
was sort of the
relevant one that

01:15:30.224 --> 01:15:33.830
straddled B. Now we
have this data structure

01:15:33.830 --> 01:15:36.800
and there's no longer recursive
levels in this picture.

01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:38.297
It's just a list.

01:15:38.297 --> 01:15:40.130
But one of the things
we said is that if you

01:15:40.130 --> 01:15:41.570
look at the very
small structures,

01:15:41.570 --> 01:15:44.120
those are free because
they just stay in cache.

01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:45.140
I'm going to assume--

01:15:45.140 --> 01:15:47.780
it's a little bit of a
bastardization of notation--

01:15:47.780 --> 01:15:52.310
assume that all the levels
up to M fit in cache.

01:15:52.310 --> 01:15:54.800
It's really up to, like,
size M over 2 or something,

01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:56.090
but let's just call it all.

01:15:56.090 --> 01:15:58.550
If x is less than
M, then you know

01:15:58.550 --> 01:16:01.610
all this stuff has size order
M. And so let's just say--

01:16:01.610 --> 01:16:04.400
by redefining what M is
by a constant factor--

01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:06.210
that just fits in cache.

01:16:06.210 --> 01:16:08.210
Because we can assume
whatever cache replacement

01:16:08.210 --> 01:16:11.090
strategy we want,
assume that these things

01:16:11.090 --> 01:16:13.530
stay in cache forever.

01:16:13.530 --> 01:16:20.600
So all of that bottom
stuff, size up to M,

01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:23.930
is permanently in cache
and costs zero to access.

01:16:23.930 --> 01:16:25.790
So those levels are for free.

01:16:25.790 --> 01:16:28.704
So it's all about when we
touch the upper levels.

01:16:28.704 --> 01:16:30.245
And, really, the
most important level

01:16:30.245 --> 01:16:32.180
would be the transition
from the things that

01:16:32.180 --> 01:16:35.270
fit in cache to the next level
up that does not fit in cache.

01:16:35.270 --> 01:16:36.920
That's going to
be the key level.

01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:44.020
But in general,
let's look at push.

01:16:44.020 --> 01:16:57.500
Or let's just assume x to
the 3/2 is bigger than M.

01:16:57.500 --> 01:17:00.530
Because we're looking at a
push at level x to the 3/2.

01:17:00.530 --> 01:17:04.970
And just by definition, if
it's less than M, it's free.

01:17:04.970 --> 01:17:06.701
Question?

01:17:06.701 --> 01:17:08.728
AUDIENCE: So how can
you assume that all

01:17:08.728 --> 01:17:11.471
of the things below
that particular size

01:17:11.471 --> 01:17:12.902
always stay in cache empty?

01:17:12.902 --> 01:17:15.630
So you're making assumptions
on the cache replacement?

01:17:15.630 --> 01:17:16.520
ERIK DEMAINE: I'm
making assumption

01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:18.645
on the cache replacement
strategy, which I actually

01:17:18.645 --> 01:17:19.940
made last lecture.

01:17:19.940 --> 01:17:22.850
So I said, magically
assume that we

01:17:22.850 --> 01:17:25.640
use optimal cache replacement.

01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:29.820
So whatever I choose, opt is
going to be better than that.

01:17:29.820 --> 01:17:30.740
So you're right.

01:17:30.740 --> 01:17:33.320
The algorithm doesn't get to
choose what stays in cache.

01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:35.660
But for analysis purposes,
I can say well, suppose

01:17:35.660 --> 01:17:36.951
all these things stay in cache.

01:17:36.951 --> 01:17:39.440
If I prove an upper
bound in that world,

01:17:39.440 --> 01:17:42.790
then the optimal
replacement will do better.

01:17:42.790 --> 01:17:46.850
And the LRU or FIFO
replacement will

01:17:46.850 --> 01:17:49.940
do within a constant
factor of that,

01:17:49.940 --> 01:17:52.280
again, by changing M
by a constant factor.

01:17:52.280 --> 01:17:54.830
So I'm freely throwing away
constant factors in my cache

01:17:54.830 --> 01:17:58.080
size, but then I will get
that these effectively

01:17:58.080 --> 01:17:58.960
stay in cache.

01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:04.010
FIFO or LRU will do that just
as well, or almost as well.

01:18:04.010 --> 01:18:05.740
Good question.

01:18:05.740 --> 01:18:08.465
So now we can just look at
the pushes above that level.

01:18:08.465 --> 01:18:10.590
And I really want to look
at this transition level,

01:18:10.590 --> 01:18:12.548
but we're going to have
to look at all of them.

01:18:12.548 --> 01:18:13.500
So let's do this.

01:18:13.500 --> 01:18:19.850
Now I also have tall
cache assumption.

01:18:19.850 --> 01:18:22.460
M is at least B to
the 1 plus epsilon.

01:18:22.460 --> 01:18:25.170
I actually want a somewhat
bigger assumption,

01:18:25.170 --> 01:18:29.120
which is that M is greater
than or equal to B squared.

01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:31.940
If it's not B squared,
you have to change

01:18:31.940 --> 01:18:35.780
this 3/2 and 9/4 and stuff
to be something a little bit

01:18:35.780 --> 01:18:36.860
bigger than 1.

01:18:36.860 --> 01:18:38.700
And it gets really messy
to write that down.

01:18:38.700 --> 01:18:41.579
So this data structure with
appropriate modification

01:18:41.579 --> 01:18:43.370
does work for other
tall cache assumptions,

01:18:43.370 --> 01:18:44.780
but let's just assume this one.

01:18:44.780 --> 01:18:47.750
So this means M over B
is at least B. That's

01:18:47.750 --> 01:18:49.940
sort of the clean statement.

01:18:49.940 --> 01:18:56.330
It's true for most caches also,
but this will be my assumption.

01:18:56.330 --> 01:18:57.640
OK.

01:18:57.640 --> 01:18:58.190
Cool.

01:18:58.190 --> 01:19:03.050
So if we just do some algebra.

01:19:03.050 --> 01:19:08.370
Claim is this is x is
greater than B to the 4/3.

01:19:08.370 --> 01:19:11.930
So that's just taking
this inequality,

01:19:11.930 --> 01:19:14.420
x the 3/2 is greater than
or equal to B squared

01:19:14.420 --> 01:19:16.670
and raising to
the exponent, 2/3.

01:19:16.670 --> 01:19:18.680
And so this turns
into x and this

01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:21.570
turns into B to the 2 times
2/3, which would be the 4/3.

01:19:21.570 --> 01:19:26.120
So x is quite a
bit bigger than B.

01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:30.800
In particular, this means that
x over B is bigger than 1,

01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:31.460
by a lot.

01:19:31.460 --> 01:19:35.120
But if we take ceiling's
on this, no big deal.

01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:37.751
So we don't have to
worry about the ceilings.

01:19:37.751 --> 01:19:38.250
All right.

01:19:38.250 --> 01:19:46.380
Now the claim is that the
distribution step costs--

01:19:46.380 --> 01:19:48.600
this is really the
interesting part--

01:19:48.600 --> 01:19:54.030
x over B plus x to the
1/2 memory transfers.

01:19:57.060 --> 01:19:58.050
OK.

01:19:58.050 --> 01:19:59.730
Why?

01:19:59.730 --> 01:20:03.590
Remember, up here we have
x to 1/2 down buffers

01:20:03.590 --> 01:20:04.565
that we're looking at.

01:20:04.565 --> 01:20:05.940
And we're visiting
them in order.

01:20:05.940 --> 01:20:08.100
We touch this down buffer.

01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:12.990
And really, we just care
about the max, here.

01:20:12.990 --> 01:20:15.540
And then we start writing
elements one by one.

01:20:15.540 --> 01:20:17.700
But if we write
elements one by one,

01:20:17.700 --> 01:20:20.231
the very first element we
write costs an entire memory

01:20:20.231 --> 01:20:20.730
transfer.

01:20:20.730 --> 01:20:22.300
We have to load in a block.

01:20:22.300 --> 01:20:25.300
But then we can fill that block
and then write out that block.

01:20:25.300 --> 01:20:28.270
So we get to write out
B items in one step.

01:20:28.270 --> 01:20:31.050
So we pay x to
the 1/2 because we

01:20:31.050 --> 01:20:35.862
have to touch the last
block of this down buffer,

01:20:35.862 --> 01:20:37.320
this down buffer,
this down buffer.

01:20:37.320 --> 01:20:39.840
And they're x to the
1/2 down buffers.

01:20:39.840 --> 01:20:41.400
So each one, we have to pay 1.

01:20:41.400 --> 01:20:42.150
That's this part.

01:20:42.150 --> 01:20:43.377
That's the expensive part.

01:20:43.377 --> 01:20:45.210
But then, once we're
actually writing items,

01:20:45.210 --> 01:20:48.900
if we stay here for a while,
that's basically for free.

01:20:48.900 --> 01:20:51.000
Overall, we're writing x items.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:55.920
And so to write them all will
only take x over B ceiling,

01:20:55.920 --> 01:20:58.290
sort of, over the
entire summation.

01:20:58.290 --> 01:21:02.700
But we have to pay 1 to start
out here, here, and here.

01:21:02.700 --> 01:21:05.610
So this is the real
amount of time.

01:21:05.610 --> 01:21:08.000
And I want to amortize
that, essentially.

01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:14.610
So there's two cases now.

01:21:14.610 --> 01:21:20.490
If x is greater than or equal
to B squared, then we're happy.

01:21:20.490 --> 01:21:23.100
x is greater than or
equal to B squared,

01:21:23.100 --> 01:21:27.510
then this term dominates.

01:21:27.510 --> 01:21:29.550
And so this is tinier.

01:21:29.550 --> 01:21:30.280
All right.

01:21:30.280 --> 01:21:35.010
Say, x is B cubed, then
this is x to the 3/2--

01:21:35.010 --> 01:21:36.360
sorry, this is the B to the 3/2.

01:21:36.360 --> 01:21:38.880
This is B squared,
so this is bigger.

01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:44.610
And so then the cost
is just x over B.

01:21:44.610 --> 01:21:46.800
And we're done, because
we needed to prove

01:21:46.800 --> 01:21:48.080
it's x over B times log.

01:21:48.080 --> 01:21:51.690
We had to do this to sort, but
this distribution will be free.

01:21:51.690 --> 01:21:55.740
Now that says all the
high levels are free.

01:21:55.740 --> 01:21:56.990
All the low levels are free.

01:21:59.394 --> 01:22:01.560
If you're less than B
squared, then your less than M

01:22:01.560 --> 01:22:02.354
and you're free.

01:22:02.354 --> 01:22:04.770
It's saying, if you're bigger
than B squared, you're free.

01:22:04.770 --> 01:22:07.710
But there's going to be one
level right in between where

01:22:07.710 --> 01:22:09.435
you're not really
bigger or smaller.

01:22:13.100 --> 01:22:20.770
So there's one level where it's
going to B to the 4/3 less than

01:22:20.770 --> 01:22:23.850
or equal to x less than
or equal to B squared,

01:22:23.850 --> 01:22:25.860
strictly less than.

01:22:25.860 --> 01:22:29.280
Because you're jumping in
this doubly exponential way,

01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:31.180
you might miss slightly.

01:22:31.180 --> 01:22:33.530
And so you're in between
these two levels.

01:22:36.920 --> 01:22:37.440
Why is this?

01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:40.530
Because we only know that x
to the 3/2 is less than M.

01:22:40.530 --> 01:22:44.400
We don't know that
x is less than M.

01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:46.662
So we have a bit of slot there.

01:22:52.790 --> 01:22:59.720
So then at this transition
point, what we do

01:22:59.720 --> 01:23:06.140
is say, OK, we can't afford
to store this whole-- x to 3/2

01:23:06.140 --> 01:23:07.760
is not less than M.
So we can't afford

01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:09.290
to store all this in the cache.

01:23:09.290 --> 01:23:12.825
But we can afford to store
the last block of this guy

01:23:12.825 --> 01:23:14.450
and the last block
of this guy, all the

01:23:14.450 --> 01:23:17.450
down buffers we can store
the last block in cache.

01:23:17.450 --> 01:23:19.340
Why?

01:23:19.340 --> 01:23:25.410
Because there's only
x to the 1/2 of them.

01:23:25.410 --> 01:23:28.230
And we know that x is
less than B squared.

01:23:28.230 --> 01:23:32.690
So if x is less than B
squared, x to the 1/2

01:23:32.690 --> 01:23:36.320
is less than B, which
is less than M over B

01:23:36.320 --> 01:23:40.560
because M is least B squared,
by tall cache assumption.

01:23:40.560 --> 01:23:43.505
So this is the number of blocks
that we can afford in cache.

01:23:43.505 --> 01:23:44.880
This is number of
blocks we want.

01:23:44.880 --> 01:23:47.220
I want 1 block
for each of these.

01:23:47.220 --> 01:23:49.610
So basically then,
this x to the one half

01:23:49.610 --> 01:23:53.520
term disappears for the
one transition level.

01:23:53.520 --> 01:23:56.380
So this is free.

01:23:56.380 --> 01:24:11.720
Because you can afford 1 block
per down buffer in cache.

01:24:11.720 --> 01:24:16.620
And so, again, we
get an x over B cost.

01:24:16.620 --> 01:24:19.100
So the distribution
is basically free.

01:24:19.100 --> 01:24:21.770
The hard part is the sorting.

01:24:21.770 --> 01:24:24.200
And then the idea
is that, well, OK--

01:24:24.200 --> 01:24:26.360
now this is one push.

01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:29.930
When we do an insert, that item
might get pushed many times,

01:24:29.930 --> 01:24:33.200
but basically can only
get pushed once per level.

01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:37.970
So you end up taking this cost
and summing it over all x.

01:24:37.970 --> 01:24:42.500
So if you look at an insertion,
amortize what you pay--

01:24:42.500 --> 01:24:45.170
or you look at the sum
over all these things.

01:24:48.680 --> 01:24:52.310
You get the sorting bound
on x-- summed over x where x

01:24:52.310 --> 01:24:54.470
is growing doubly exponential.

01:24:54.470 --> 01:24:56.900
And so this becomes a
geometric series, or even

01:24:56.900 --> 01:24:58.310
super geometric.

01:24:58.310 --> 01:25:01.190
And so you get--

01:25:01.190 --> 01:25:03.650
I guess I should look
at it per element.

01:25:03.650 --> 01:25:06.560
You look at the amortized
cost per element,

01:25:06.560 --> 01:25:08.780
so I get to divide by x.

01:25:08.780 --> 01:25:11.290
Because when I do a
push, I push x elements.

01:25:11.290 --> 01:25:12.980
So I get to divide by x, here.

01:25:12.980 --> 01:25:15.450
And then if an element
gets pushed to all levels,

01:25:15.450 --> 01:25:17.500
I have to sum over
all these x's.

01:25:17.500 --> 01:25:20.920
But you do this summation
and you get order--

01:25:20.920 --> 01:25:22.640
it's dominated by the last term.

01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:32.330
Sorry, this should be N.

01:25:32.330 --> 01:25:33.350
This is the fun part.

01:25:33.350 --> 01:25:35.630
We're taking logs, here,
but conveniently this

01:25:35.630 --> 01:25:38.660
was doubly exponential
growing, the x over B.

01:25:38.660 --> 01:25:41.900
So when we sum these
is singly exponential.

01:25:41.900 --> 01:25:44.020
So it's a geometric series.

01:25:44.020 --> 01:25:46.850
And so we are just dominated
by the last term, which

01:25:46.850 --> 01:25:48.890
is where we get log base
M over B of N over B.

01:25:48.890 --> 01:25:54.320
And this is our amortized
cost per insertion.

01:25:54.320 --> 01:25:56.460
Deletions are
basically the same.

01:25:56.460 --> 01:25:58.274
You just two pulls
instead of pushes.

01:25:58.274 --> 01:26:00.440
And you have, sort of, the
reverse of a distribution

01:26:00.440 --> 01:26:02.675
step-- in some
ways, even simpler.

01:26:02.675 --> 01:26:05.840
You don't have to do
this clever analysis.

01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:06.340
Question?

01:26:06.340 --> 01:26:07.974
AUDIENCE: Can you
explain, once again,

01:26:07.974 --> 01:26:11.173
how is it that you got the
distributed cost of x over B?

01:26:11.173 --> 01:26:12.891
So I understand
that every time, you

01:26:12.891 --> 01:26:15.703
need to pay that x to the
1/2 because you need to load.

01:26:15.703 --> 01:26:17.170
But where did the x over B come?

01:26:17.170 --> 01:26:17.900
ERIK DEMAINE: This
is essentially

01:26:17.900 --> 01:26:19.190
amortized per element.

01:26:19.190 --> 01:26:22.580
We're just paying 1 over B.
Once the block has been loaded--

01:26:22.580 --> 01:26:24.590
it's only after we
insert B items that we

01:26:24.590 --> 01:26:26.520
have to load another item.

01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:29.940
So that's why it's
x over B, here.

01:26:29.940 --> 01:26:31.021
Good.

01:26:31.021 --> 01:26:31.520
Question?

01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:34.364
AUDIENCE: Which buffers do
we keep sorted at all times?

01:26:34.364 --> 01:26:35.530
ERIK DEMAINE: Which buffer--

01:26:35.530 --> 01:26:36.350
AUDIENCE: Which buffers
do we keep sorted?

01:26:36.350 --> 01:26:38.891
ERIK DEMAINE: We're only going
to keep the very bottom buffer

01:26:38.891 --> 01:26:41.330
sorted at all times.

01:26:41.330 --> 01:26:42.830
So I mean, it doesn't
really matter.

01:26:42.830 --> 01:26:43.970
You don't even have
to keep those sorted,

01:26:43.970 --> 01:26:45.410
because you can afford
to look at all of them.

01:26:45.410 --> 01:26:47.048
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] I
think the upper levels when

01:26:47.048 --> 01:26:49.160
we're trying to figure
out where it goes?

01:26:49.160 --> 01:26:50.630
ERIK DEMAINE: What we do
need-- we don't need them

01:26:50.630 --> 01:26:51.350
in sorted order.

01:26:51.350 --> 01:26:55.130
But we need to know
where the max is, yeah.

01:26:55.130 --> 01:26:58.520
So I guess, maybe, maintain
a linked list of the items

01:26:58.520 --> 01:26:59.640
would be one way to do it.

01:26:59.640 --> 01:27:01.880
So the sort order is in there,
but they're not physically

01:27:01.880 --> 01:27:02.900
stored in sorted order.

01:27:02.900 --> 01:27:05.921
That would be a little bit
too much to hope for, I think.

01:27:05.921 --> 01:27:06.420
Yeah.

01:27:06.420 --> 01:27:07.919
We do need to keep
track of the max,

01:27:07.919 --> 01:27:11.110
but that's easy to do
as you're inserting.

01:27:11.110 --> 01:27:12.680
Cool.

01:27:12.680 --> 01:27:13.790
So that's priority queues.

01:27:13.790 --> 01:27:16.670
You can look at the
notes for deletions.
