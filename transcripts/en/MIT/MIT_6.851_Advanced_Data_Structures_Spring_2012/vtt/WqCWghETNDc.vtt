00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.092
ERIK DEMAINE: All right,
welcome back to 6.851.

00:00:25.092 --> 00:00:28.530
We continue our theme
of time travel today.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.776
Before I get started, I
wanted to briefly talk

00:00:30.776 --> 00:00:32.150
about the project,
which I forgot

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:33.650
to talk about in lecture one.

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.710
Project is sort of the focus of
your evaluation in the class,

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.380
other than problems
sets inscribing,

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.590
it's supposed to be
the bulk of the work.

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.110
Project can be
theoretical, trying

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:43.151
to solve an open problem.

00:00:43.151 --> 00:00:44.510
You don't have to succeed.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.968
If you want to do that, you
should come to the open problem

00:00:46.968 --> 00:00:47.480
sessions.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.590
Could be a survey of
things, especially not

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.500
covered in class, or not
covered in class in much detail.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.790
Look at a few papers.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.490
Could be an implementation of
one of these data structures.

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.890
A lot of the data structures
we're talking about here

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.056
have never been implemented.

00:01:02.056 --> 00:01:04.069
We don't know how well
they perform in practice,

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:05.300
and it'd cool to find out.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.216
Many of them have though,
so you should do one

00:01:07.216 --> 00:01:09.980
that hasn't been done already.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:11.840
Those are the main
project types.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.300
There will in a
month or so, there

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.280
will be a project proposal
deadline where you

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.750
have to pick what you're doing.

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.500
And then the project itself
is due last day of classes.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.200
And in the last
few lectures, there

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.457
will be project presentations.

00:01:25.457 --> 00:01:27.290
So you'll also have to
give a talk about it.

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:28.550
You can do group projects.

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.850
And for more people we
expect more stuff to be done,

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.210
that's all.

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.880
Otherwise unconstrained.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.340
So in time travel land,
I guess the most sort

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.450
of physically
realistic physics land,

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.567
if time travel is
branching universes

00:01:45.567 --> 00:01:47.150
where if you make a
change in the past

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:48.441
you get a totally new universe.

00:01:48.441 --> 00:01:50.370
That's full persistence.

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:51.772
That's last class.

00:01:51.772 --> 00:01:54.230
Today we're going to do the
more science fiction-y approach

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:57.769
to time travel, which
is you can-- like in

00:01:57.769 --> 00:01:58.560
Back to the Future.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.560
You can go back in
time, make a change,

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.690
and then return to the
present and see all the

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.750
intervening-- the result of
all the intervening things that

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.120
happen meanwhile.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.250
A fun example of this,
if you haven't seen it,

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.830
is the movie Time
Cop, where there's

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.810
this guy going back
in time, trying

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.810
to fight evil time travelers.

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.420
And when he returns
to the present,

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.820
sometimes, like the
whole time travel

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.140
service is starting to fail.

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.370
And there's this worry
that he'll never be

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:26.900
able to return to the present.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.240
So anyway, we want to do
that with the data structure.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.440
So this is the idea
of retroactivity.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.190
In general, we think of a data
structure as having a timeline.

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:52.520
We're going to maintain one
linear timeline of updates.

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.650
So here's time.

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:05.810
And the idea is, well, maybe at
time 0 you do an insert of 7.

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:11.600
And then at time 1, you
maybe did an insert of 3.

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.630
And then at time 2,
you did a delete-min.

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:19.960
OK, what's that spell?

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.200
Or, at the end you have--

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.810
right now, you'd have
just the element 7.

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.900
In general, every data structure
you can think of is this.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.590
Now normally, we're always
appending to the timeline

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.200
that's working in the present.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.900
You're doing operations
on the present.

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.300
But we'd like to allow--
with retroactive data

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.760
structures you can
go back in time, say

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.550
right at the beginning of
time, and say actually I

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:48.660
meant to put, at time minus 1, I
meant to do something insert 4.

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.050
Or actually, insert 2 would
be a little more interesting.

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.140
Insert 2 is interesting,
because that actually

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.990
changes what the delete-min
operation would have done.

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:58.460
And so I want to
go back in time,

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:01.040
do this, and then return to
the present, say what's my data

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.510
structure look like now.

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.990
I want to be able to do
the regular queries I can.

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:09.530
So let's say you can do
queries at the present.

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.420
This is now.

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.050
And you can do queries here.

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:21.890
And I want to be able to
add and remove operations.

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:30.650
Update operations at any time.

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.780
So that's what's called a
partially retroactive data

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.920
structure.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.620
So like persistence, we
have partial and full.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:51.410
So in general, we're going
to have insert at a given

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.525
time, a given update.

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:01.970
Delete the operation
at a given time.

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:02.800
And query.

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:15.290
And I'm going to
use capital letters

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:18.110
to denote retroactive operations
and lower case letters

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:19.470
to denote regular operations.

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:20.820
So it's intentional.

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:22.550
This is an uppercase insert.

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:23.850
This is a lowercase insert.

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:29.960
So we're inserting an insert
at time, the time before 0.

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.380
What exactly does
time mean here?

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:36.395
We're not going to work with
that too much directly today.

00:05:36.395 --> 00:05:38.270
You can think of them
as just being integers.

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:41.360
But it gets awkward if you just
keep inserting new operations

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:42.920
to do in between 1 and 2.

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.900
There aren't very many
integers between 1 and 2.

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.920
One easy solution to this is
use the order maintenance data

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:51.089
structure that we mentioned
in the last class, where

00:05:51.089 --> 00:05:52.880
you basically are
maintaining a linked list

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.600
and you're able to insert
new times in between any two

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:57.200
given times.

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.240
And you can still do order
queries in constant time.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.229
But I mean, if you
don't mind logs

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:04.520
you could just store the
times in a binary search tree.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.280
That's an easy way to do it.

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:12.410
We're not really going to
worry about that too much here.

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:14.120
What we're interested
here is how do we

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:17.600
maintain the sort
of side effects

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.210
of doing this operation
earlier in time,

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:23.540
computing all of this,
or chain reactions that

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:26.900
would have happened meanwhile,
sort of butterfly effect.

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:33.980
All right, I want to define
partial retroactivity

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:43.200
means queries are always
done at the present.

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:46.670
Let's say t equals
infinity or now.

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:48.790
This is what you might
call the Q model,

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:50.300
if you're a Star Trek fan.

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:52.479
You can exist in all time
simultaneously, do updates

00:06:52.479 --> 00:06:54.020
whenever you feel
like it, do queries

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:57.140
whenever you feel like it.

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:59.780
All right model clear.

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:02.040
Now as you might
expect, this is hard.

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:05.580
You can't always do
retroactivity super well.

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:08.900
But we'll talk about our
situations you can do well

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:10.940
and what you can do in general.

00:07:15.315 --> 00:07:20.833
Go to an easy case, which
is still fairly interesting.

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:29.720
Suppose you have
commutative updates,

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:36.672
meaning x followed by y is the
same thing as y followed by x.

00:07:36.672 --> 00:07:38.630
This would be great if
I could reorder updates,

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:41.600
because then I don't really care
about the sequence of updates,

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:45.470
as long as I'm only
querying the final results.

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:47.337
If I want to do an
update in the past--

00:07:47.337 --> 00:07:49.670
this would not be an example
of commutative-- delete-min

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:51.255
and insert are not commutative.

00:07:51.255 --> 00:07:54.770
But if I was just doing
insert and delete for example,

00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:58.787
delete 7, whatever,
then inserting 2 here

00:07:58.787 --> 00:08:00.620
is the same thing as
inserting 2 at the end,

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:03.230
as long as I'm only
querying the end.

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:06.640
So this would be an easy case
for partial retroactivity.

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:17.450
If my updates are commutative,
then inserting an operation

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:25.670
at time t is the same thing as
inserting that operation now,

00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:26.480
at the end of time.

00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:30.830
That's for inserts.

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:33.260
But if I want to
also be able to--

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:36.110
for retroactive inserts,
I should say, capital I.

00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:39.230
If I want to be able to
do retroactive deletes,

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:40.909
I need something else.

00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:41.900
I need some way--

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:45.950
I still want to only work
in the present, if I can.

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:48.680
And for that I need inversion.

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:49.820
I have invertible updates.

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:58.760
If there is some way to,
given an operation x,

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:02.190
compute a new operation x
inverse, that does the reverse,

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:04.610
and that's equivalent
to nothing,

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:08.450
then deleting an operation
is the same thing as doing

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:09.560
the inverse.

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:11.840
And if you have
also commutativity--

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:17.840
so I'm adding these two
constraints-- then delete t

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:27.091
some operation is the same thing
as inserting now that operation

00:09:27.091 --> 00:09:27.590
inverse.

00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:34.920
So that's-- if I have
both of these properties,

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:37.320
then partial
retroactivity is trivial.

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:40.810
I just do everything
in the present.

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:44.080
May not seem very exciting, but
it solves a bunch of problems

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:45.370
already for free.

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:48.220
So for example, hashing.

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:51.654
If you want a dynamic
hash table or dictionary,

00:09:51.654 --> 00:09:53.820
and you want to be able to
make retroactive changes,

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:56.236
it really doesn't matter whether
you make them in the past

00:09:56.236 --> 00:09:57.070
or in the present.

00:09:57.070 --> 00:10:00.130
I'm assuming a little bit here
that you don't, for example,

00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:03.070
clobber a key and write
to the same key twice.

00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:05.490
Then the order would matter.

00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:08.410
But if you store all copies of
all keys, then this is true.

00:10:10.936 --> 00:10:12.310
Slightly more
interesting, if you

00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:21.250
have an array with the
operation add delta

00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:22.480
to a given array element.

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.980
So if I had an assignment here,
then the order would matter.

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:29.000
But if I have only
addition or subtraction,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.180
that's fine, because
addition and subtraction

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:32.620
are commutative.

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:34.690
So I can do that.

00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:37.792
Not terribly exciting,
as you might imagine.

00:10:37.792 --> 00:10:40.000
We're going to get to much
more interesting examples.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.950
But a natural question here is
what about full retroactivity?

00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:46.780
So partial's nice.

00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:48.991
But if I have such
an easy setup,

00:10:48.991 --> 00:10:50.365
can I achieve full
retroactivity?

00:10:50.365 --> 00:10:53.530
It's not so obvious because
now working in the present,

00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:57.130
it's not correctly
reflecting the past.

00:10:57.130 --> 00:10:59.170
To do that, we need--

00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:01.210
we cannot do it in
general, we don't know how.

00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:05.230
But there is a situation
where we do know how.

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:07.285
First I'll define
a search problem.

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:14.080
The search problem is--

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:16.880
you've seen many
examples of this

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:19.460
in your algorithmic lifetime--

00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:22.960
I maintain a set S of objects--

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:24.820
we don't know what they are--

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:30.100
subject to insert, delete,
and some kind of search query.

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:42.250
And I want to focus in on the
types of queries we allow.

00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:45.940
So this in particular,
insert and delete

00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:47.770
are commutative and invertible.

00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:49.220
They are each other's inverses.

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:52.220
So n queries are queries.

00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:54.190
This is really just a
constraint on updates.

00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:57.041
So search problems fall
into this easy class.

00:11:57.041 --> 00:11:58.540
So in particular,
it covers hashing.

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:04.570
Fine, that's a general
class of problems.

00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:07.990
Here's a slightly less
general class of problems,

00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:11.180
which are sort of well-studied.

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:13.870
The old geometric data
structures literature.

00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:15.160
Decomposable search problems.

00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:22.060
This is a concept
from 1980 revitalized.

00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:23.920
I should mention this
retroactive paper

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:24.880
is pretty recent.

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:29.412
I think the journal
version appeared in 2007.

00:12:29.412 --> 00:12:32.269
I have 2003 and 2007 here.

00:12:32.269 --> 00:12:34.060
So those are the two
versions of the paper.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.640
So what's a decomposable
search problem?

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:44.020
Same thing, but the query
is of a particular flavor,

00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:47.170
has a particular structure.

00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:52.560
If I want to do a query on the
union of two sets, a and b,

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:55.480
it's the same thing as doing
the query on the two sets

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:58.030
individually and then combining
them with some function.

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:10.717
This is a constraint
on what the query is.

00:13:10.717 --> 00:13:11.800
The problem is still this.

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:14.290
I still want to do a
query on the entire set.

00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:18.220
But I just know this fact,
that if I could somehow

00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:19.930
solve the query
on smaller sets, I

00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:23.080
could combine them into the
union using this f function.

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:25.510
For some, let's say this can
be computed in constant time.

00:13:30.329 --> 00:13:31.870
That's a decomposable
search problem.

00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:35.492
For example, suppose I have
a set of points in the plane.

00:13:35.492 --> 00:13:37.450
And I want to know, given
a query point, what's

00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:39.160
the nearest point in my set?

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:43.210
So it would be dynamic
nearest neighbor.

00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:46.090
If I could compute the nearest
neighbor among one subset

00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:47.140
of the points, and
the nearest neighbor

00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:49.660
among a different subset, I can
compute the nearest neighbor

00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:52.240
among the union just by
taking the min of the two.

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:54.490
Doesn't matter whether
a and b overlap.

00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:56.650
That will still give
the right answer.

00:13:56.650 --> 00:13:58.720
Sort of a min over all things.

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:02.140
I have some other examples.

00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:04.550
Successor on a line.

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:06.220
If I'm given a
query point, I want

00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:09.190
to know what the next, the
nearest item after it is.

00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:12.850
That's sort of like
one-sided nearest neighbor.

00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:16.840
Yeah, point location, we'll
get to that in the future.

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:18.590
Don't want to time
travel too much.

00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:22.760
OK, so some property-- some
queries have this property.

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:23.260
Some don't.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:27.160
If they do-- and we have
commutative and invertability--

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:30.010
I claim full retroactivity
becomes easy.

00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:31.030
Relatively easy.

00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:33.140
Log factor overhead.

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:35.500
So that's what I
wanted to show you.

00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:43.270
Full retro for decomposable
search problems.

00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:50.470
Decomposable search
problems are automatically

00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:52.090
computed of an
invertible, so I don't

00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:54.410
need to write that constraint.

00:14:54.410 --> 00:15:01.110
In log-- I have n here,
but I think I mean m--

00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:01.610
overhead.

00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:06.790
It's a multiplicative factor.

00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:09.089
m here is the number of
retroactive operations

00:15:09.089 --> 00:15:09.630
you're doing.

00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:11.606
So it's the size
of the timeline.

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:22.150
OK, we're going to do that
via something called a segment

00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:29.012
tree, which was introduced
in the same paper that

00:15:29.012 --> 00:15:31.470
dealt with decomposable search
problems by Bentley and Saxe

00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:34.450
in 1980.

00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:36.850
They weren't thinking
about time travel.

00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:40.450
Retroactively their
result is useful.

00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:44.080
So what's a segment tree?

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:45.260
It's a tree.

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:48.490
Let me draw my favorite picture.

00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:51.020
Draw this many times in
this class, I'm sure.

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:59.440
I would like to build a balanced
binary search tree on time.

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:00.475
Leaves will be time.

00:16:03.490 --> 00:16:04.015
Here's time.

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:12.969
And the idea is, well, if I
have my operations, my updates--

00:16:12.969 --> 00:16:15.010
which are what the things
that live on time are--

00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:17.090
are inserts and deletes.

00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:19.780
And so if I look at an
element, at some point

00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:20.890
it might be inserted.

00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:22.556
At some point later
it might be deleted.

00:16:22.556 --> 00:16:25.240
I'm going to assume every
element is inserted and deleted

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:27.820
only once.

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:29.660
Otherwise, if it
happens multiple times,

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:31.910
think of them as
different elements.

00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:36.460
Then every element exists
for an interval of time.

00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:39.940
So for example, maybe
I have an element

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:42.880
that exists for this
interval of time.

00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:46.960
Maybe it gets inserted here
and then gets deleted here.

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:50.380
How should I represent
that interval in my tree?

00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:53.650
Let's call this element a.

00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:56.442
Well, if I draw a
complete binary tree,

00:16:56.442 --> 00:16:58.150
there there's an
obvious way to represent

00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:04.871
that interval, which is as the
union of these four intervals.

00:17:04.871 --> 00:17:06.579
If you think of this
node as representing

00:17:06.579 --> 00:17:08.750
the interval of
all of its leaves,

00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:11.140
descendant leaves, then
I could put a here.

00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:16.660
And I could put a here,
and here, and here.

00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:19.270
I do that for all my elements.

00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:21.640
This picture's going
to get messy quickly.

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:24.599
Let me just do one more example.

00:17:24.599 --> 00:17:31.880
So maybe I have an
element from here to here.

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:33.850
Then I'm going to
call that element b.

00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:36.010
Then I'll put b here.

00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:38.950
And I'll put b here.

00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:41.650
So always putting it
is as high as I can.

00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:44.330
I don't want to put b or a in
all the leaves it appears in,

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:46.330
because that would be a
linear number of leaves.

00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:47.950
If I do it like
this, there's only

00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:50.560
log n subtrees I care
about, representing

00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:57.000
the interval as a union of log
n subtree aligned intervals.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.090
OK, now the real picture is
slightly messier than this.

00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:03.670
I drew a nice,
complete, perfect tree.

00:18:03.670 --> 00:18:06.677
In reality, you're inserting
new operations in here.

00:18:06.677 --> 00:18:08.260
And so you've actually
got to maintain

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:09.843
this as a balanced
binary search tree.

00:18:09.843 --> 00:18:13.560
So use a red-black tree, AVL
tree, or pick your favorite.

00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:17.420
As long as it stays balanced,
you can still do this.

00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:19.870
It'll be a little less
obvious how to do rotations,

00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:22.660
but let's not worry about
rotations right now.

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:25.150
Now I want to do a query.

00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:26.200
What's a query look like?

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:28.300
Well, I care about
all the things done up

00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:29.170
to a certain time.

00:18:29.170 --> 00:18:31.990
Or really I care
about who exists.

00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:36.876
Let's say I want to do a
query on an array here.

00:18:36.876 --> 00:18:39.250
That's maybe not so exciting.

00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:43.060
Let's do a query here.

00:18:46.090 --> 00:18:49.510
I want to know at
this time who exists,

00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:51.970
and perform the
query on that time.

00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:54.340
So really, I'm asking
about everything

00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:58.930
done in this interval,
from the beginning of time

00:18:58.930 --> 00:19:01.430
to my query time t.

00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:06.550
So here's query of t.

00:19:06.550 --> 00:19:08.500
Now we don't know
what the query is.

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:10.380
We just know it's on the set.

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:14.720
And we know that is decomposable
in this way by a set union.

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:18.070
So the idea is, well I'll do the
query on this data structure,

00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:20.847
because that represents
whatever existed at that time.

00:19:20.847 --> 00:19:22.930
And then I'll do the query
on this data structure,

00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:24.555
because that represents
the things that

00:19:24.555 --> 00:19:25.930
existed before that.

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:32.240
That doesn't look so great.

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:36.550
OK, so I need to put
each element in log n

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:39.310
different nodes in
here, such that I

00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:42.280
can answer a query by looking
at log n different nodes.

00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:45.670
And a query is asking about
what are all the things that

00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:48.480
exist at this time.

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:50.310
So here it would be ab.

00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:51.810
Over here it would be nothing.

00:19:51.810 --> 00:19:54.884
Over here it would be nothing.

00:19:54.884 --> 00:19:56.357
Yeah?

00:19:56.357 --> 00:19:58.812
AUDIENCE: If you're
querying, the time

00:19:58.812 --> 00:20:00.776
correspond to
particular [INAUDIBLE]..

00:20:00.776 --> 00:20:03.250
Then you can query all
the data structures--

00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:05.900
ERIK DEMAINE: OK, maybe I was
just doing the queries wrong.

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:08.630
Good, I think
that's a good idea.

00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:12.080
I guess I'm asking about
querying this time.

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:13.850
So which node should I do?

00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:15.350
All the ancestors.

00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:21.920
I see.

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:24.880
Claim that does it.

00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:25.962
Gotta think about it.

00:20:25.962 --> 00:20:29.609
AUDIENCE: And then
you carry [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:29.609 --> 00:20:31.400
ERIK DEMAINE: That
definitely gets a and b.

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:32.260
That looks good.

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:34.180
All right, exercise to
prove that this works.

00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:40.150
I think that is right.

00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:42.640
So it's an asymmetry
between queries and updates.

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:48.550
For updates, you basically
partition the interval.

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:54.784
AUDIENCE: What happens to
a very short-lived element

00:20:54.784 --> 00:20:57.736
at the very end of
the time travel?

00:20:57.736 --> 00:21:13.030
[INAUDIBLE]

00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:14.530
ERIK DEMAINE: So
maybe this works.

00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:16.630
I'll think about
it offline and I'll

00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:18.580
send email if it doesn't work.

00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:21.670
But I think this is right.

00:21:21.670 --> 00:21:23.320
So for query, you walk up time.

00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:25.990
And I'm going to query each
of these data structures.

00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:28.270
Now this is a logarithmic
factor overhead,

00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:32.230
both in time and space, because
each element might be stored

00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:33.480
in log n different structures.

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:35.510
Or what are in these
nodes, by the way?

00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:38.535
That is your data structure,
the non-retroactive version.

00:21:38.535 --> 00:21:40.660
So we're storing the
non-radioactive data structure

00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:43.935
on these guys in order to--

00:21:43.935 --> 00:21:46.990
when I add-- if I
modify a's interval,

00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:48.490
I delete it from
all the places that

00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:51.340
used to be in and then
reinsert it into all the places

00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:51.940
it's now in.

00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:54.520
So I'm doing inserts
and deletes on log n

00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:58.330
of those non-retroactive
data structures.

00:21:58.330 --> 00:22:01.490
OK, and then I combine with
f which is constant time.

00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:05.211
So only log factor
overhead on the queries.

00:22:05.211 --> 00:22:07.390
OK, a little harder
than I thought.

00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:13.300
So full retro,
full retroactivity,

00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:16.324
but in this relatively
simple special case.

00:22:16.324 --> 00:22:17.740
Let's talk about
the general case.

00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:42.830
There's an obvious way to do
full retroactivity, which is--

00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:44.200
let's say partial retroactivity.

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:46.780
I want to know what
happened in the present.

00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:51.280
The obvious thing to do is write
down all the changes you made.

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:53.800
And then if you want to
make a retroactive change,

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:57.580
you roll back, do your change,
and then replay everything

00:22:57.580 --> 00:22:59.200
that happened meanwhile.

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:01.660
So this is the rollback method.

00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:31.450
So if I need to go back in time
by a factor of r, by r time

00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:34.930
units, I pay a factor
of r overhead in time.

00:23:34.930 --> 00:23:36.010
And space is reasonable.

00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:39.670
You just have to remember
everything that happened.

00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:41.340
This is pretty obvious.

00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:42.784
Also old.

00:23:42.784 --> 00:23:44.200
Unfortunately,
it's about the best

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:47.800
we can do in general,
depending on your exact model.

00:23:54.492 --> 00:23:55.670
So we add the lower bound.

00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:17.900
This is kind of a fun result
from a philosophy standpoint,

00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:20.142
philosophy of time travel.

00:24:20.142 --> 00:24:22.100
It's essentially saying
that Back to the Future

00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:23.360
is impossible.

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:25.610
I know, it's sad but true.

00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:28.850
And there's a good movie
about this called Retroactive.

00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:31.760
This is a very unknown
movie, from '97,

00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:37.667
or so, where they play through
this sequence of events.

00:24:37.667 --> 00:24:39.750
And then there's a time
machine which brings them,

00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:42.740
I forget, an hour into the past.

00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:44.510
And then they have to
relive those events.

00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:45.882
And they can make changes.

00:24:45.882 --> 00:24:47.840
But they have to spend
all that time until they

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:48.830
get to the time machine again.

00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:51.290
They still didn't get it
right, so they go back in time.

00:24:51.290 --> 00:24:54.140
And the movie repeats
like six times or so,

00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:55.660
until they finally get it right.

00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:59.030
Or I shouldn't, whatever,
forget the ending actually.

00:24:59.030 --> 00:25:03.020
So that's realistic in that
we know from persistence,

00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:05.150
we can remember the past.

00:25:05.150 --> 00:25:08.360
And we can jump back into the
past and then just relive it.

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:10.610
And maybe make
changes along the way.

00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:13.520
But the claim is you can't
do that any more efficiently

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:16.670
than replaying all of those
events, in the worst case,

00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:19.760
and I think even in real life.

00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:21.300
Should include the worst case.

00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:22.460
So let me tell you why.

00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:24.920
All we need to live
in our universe

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:28.460
for this lower bound to hold
is a very simple computer.

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:44.360
It's a computer with
two registers, x and y.

00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:45.530
They start at zero.

00:25:45.530 --> 00:25:46.520
AUDIENCE: Question.

00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:46.745
ERIK DEMAINE: Yeah?

00:25:46.745 --> 00:25:49.161
AUDIENCE: When you say that
the overhead can be necessary,

00:25:49.161 --> 00:25:51.520
does that mean that
it's sometimes not--

00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:54.194
ERIK DEMAINE: The can be is
relative to the data structure.

00:25:54.194 --> 00:25:55.610
So there is a data
structure where

00:25:55.610 --> 00:26:01.430
you're guaranteed to need
order r in the worst case.

00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:04.804
And probably the average case
in all sorts of bad things.

00:26:04.804 --> 00:26:06.470
Yeah, so there are
some data structures,

00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:09.780
like these ones, where
you can do better.

00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:13.564
And this is for
partial retroactivity.

00:26:13.564 --> 00:26:15.230
But then there are
some data structures,

00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:16.670
like the one I'm going
to describe to you,

00:26:16.670 --> 00:26:17.780
that you cannot do better.

00:26:21.707 --> 00:26:22.790
So here are my operations.

00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:25.230
I can set x to a value.

00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:29.600
I can add a value to y.

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:35.240
I can compute the product of
x and y and put it into y.

00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:41.350
And then I have a query,
which is what is y.

00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:45.160
So this is one of the simplest
computers ever designed.

00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:47.210
A very basic calculator.

00:26:47.210 --> 00:26:51.230
But it lets us do--

00:26:51.230 --> 00:26:53.390
Here's what the operations
I'm going to do.

00:26:53.390 --> 00:26:57.890
First operation-- this
is in order of time.

00:26:57.890 --> 00:27:01.220
First I will add a into y.

00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:04.420
Then I will compute the product.

00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:06.220
Then I will compute--

00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:08.675
then I will add a
and minus 1 to y.

00:27:08.675 --> 00:27:11.900
Then I will compute the product.

00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:16.671
And then at the end, I
will add a zero to y.

00:27:16.671 --> 00:27:17.420
What does that do?

00:27:21.090 --> 00:27:22.724
Mathematicians.

00:27:22.724 --> 00:27:24.890
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:24.890 --> 00:27:27.470
ERIK DEMAINE:
Polynomial evaluation.

00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:34.650
This is equivalent to
computing a n, x to the n--

00:27:34.650 --> 00:27:38.780
well, I guess capital X
to the n, a n minus 1,

00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:41.655
x to the n minus 1, a0.

00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:46.040
OK, I didn't set X
at the beginning.

00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:49.400
But whatever X was, this
sequence of operations

00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:50.820
will evaluate this polynomial.

00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:53.870
This is called Cramer's rule
for evaluating that polynomial.

00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:56.660
Just keep multiplying
by X in each round,

00:27:56.660 --> 00:28:00.130
adding on the next coefficient.

00:28:00.130 --> 00:28:01.760
OK, so the result--

00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:03.950
this I'm just going to
do at the beginning.

00:28:03.950 --> 00:28:06.020
It's like regular operations.

00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:13.250
And now I'm going to do
things like insert at time 0

00:28:13.250 --> 00:28:17.490
that X equals some value.

00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:18.560
I'm just going to keep--

00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:21.310
first I'll put it here, then
right after, then right after--

00:28:21.310 --> 00:28:22.580
keep doing those insertions.

00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:24.740
I completely change what X is.

00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:28.310
And so I change where I'm
evaluating this polynomial.

00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:30.950
And claim is you
really can't do that

00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:33.740
any faster than
reevaluating the polynomial.

00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:45.630
In a history independent
algebraic decision tree model--

00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:51.830
which I don't want to
define precisely, but maybe

00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:53.720
computation tree
would be better.

00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:57.740
Anyway, this is just you draw a
tree of all the possible things

00:28:57.740 --> 00:28:59.400
you could do.

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:02.750
And the things you can do are
additions, multiplications,

00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:07.690
subtractions, divisions,
all field operations.

00:29:07.690 --> 00:29:13.550
So for any field, this would
work with reals, would also,

00:29:13.550 --> 00:29:17.990
should work for
integers module LP.

00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:20.690
Any fields.

00:29:20.690 --> 00:29:25.910
And the interesting part is
independent of preprocessing

00:29:25.910 --> 00:29:29.090
of the coefficients, you can
stare at those coefficients

00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:31.040
however long you like.

00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:40.190
In the worst case, you need
mega n field operations,

00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:43.380
where n is the degree
of the polynomial.

00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:46.220
So this is a known
result from 2001.

00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:49.780
And so it tells you that each
of these retroactive operations,

00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:51.380
it's n time units in the past.

00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:53.600
And you need order n
time to complete it.

00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:55.550
Even though these
operations can be

00:29:55.550 --> 00:29:58.130
solved in constant time each.

00:29:58.130 --> 00:30:01.360
So it's a factor n loss.

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:04.300
Now this is a particular
model of computation.

00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:06.970
It implies something like an
integer or a random access

00:30:06.970 --> 00:30:10.120
machine, where you can have
arrays, I don't really care.

00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:11.920
But as long as the
way that you're

00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:14.950
manipulating these objects
are with field operations,

00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:17.470
you're in trouble.

00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:19.990
OK, but there are conceivably
other things you could do.

00:30:23.170 --> 00:30:24.880
If these numbers
are integers maybe

00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:26.800
I could split their
bits into parts

00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:28.294
and do crazy things with them.

00:30:28.294 --> 00:30:30.460
That's something we'll get
to later on in the class.

00:30:33.970 --> 00:30:37.654
Even then, you can't do so well.

00:30:37.654 --> 00:30:42.122
I guess I'll briefly tell
you this because there's

00:30:42.122 --> 00:30:43.330
an interesting lower balance.

00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:44.860
Oh sorry, interesting
open problem.

00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:58.720
Cell-probe model, something
we'll get into in a deeper way

00:30:58.720 --> 00:30:59.900
later on in this class.

00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:04.462
But it just says
how many objects,

00:31:04.462 --> 00:31:06.670
how many words of memory do
you need to read in order

00:31:06.670 --> 00:31:08.660
to solve your problem?

00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:10.930
So that's a lower bound on time.

00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:13.420
No matter how you're
computing with those numbers,

00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:15.790
how many of the objects,
how many of the integers

00:31:15.790 --> 00:31:17.727
do you need to read?

00:31:17.727 --> 00:31:19.810
Not necessarily just the
ai's You could split them

00:31:19.810 --> 00:31:22.420
into parts, do all
kinds of preprocessing,

00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:24.121
make a hash table,
build whatever

00:31:24.121 --> 00:31:25.120
data structure you want.

00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:29.050
How many words of that data
structure do you need to read?

00:31:29.050 --> 00:31:35.990
And the claim is at least square
root of r divided by log r.

00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:39.490
So roughly square root
of r, open problem,

00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:44.030
is can you get something
like r again in this model?

00:31:44.030 --> 00:31:47.169
So this is a very powerful
model, not at all realistic.

00:31:47.169 --> 00:31:49.210
But if you can prove a
lower bound in this model,

00:31:49.210 --> 00:31:53.530
then it holds basically all
models you could ever think of.

00:31:53.530 --> 00:31:55.570
So here's a data
structure-- or here's

00:31:55.570 --> 00:31:57.790
the proof of this lower bound.

00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:03.770
Data structure
maintains n words.

00:32:06.359 --> 00:32:07.900
I should say typically
in this class,

00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:14.460
a word is an integer
of let's say log n--

00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:15.790
I'll be more precise.

00:32:15.790 --> 00:32:17.650
w bits.

00:32:17.650 --> 00:32:18.880
w is at least log n.

00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:23.170
We'll talk about
this a lot more later

00:32:23.170 --> 00:32:26.390
in the class when we get
to integer data structures.

00:32:26.390 --> 00:32:30.850
But if you were wondering what
a word means, there it is.

00:32:30.850 --> 00:32:34.240
And the operations, the
updates you are allowed to do

00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:37.520
are arithmetic operations.

00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:40.450
So it's generalization
of this problem.

00:32:40.450 --> 00:32:43.540
You can do addition,
multiplication, division,

00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:46.341
just basic stuff.

00:32:46.341 --> 00:32:48.340
So that's the data structure
we're trying to do.

00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:52.420
And at the end you can query
what is the value of this word.

00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:54.910
And now what are we going to do?

00:32:54.910 --> 00:32:57.850
Before we did polynomial
evaluation in that model.

00:32:57.850 --> 00:33:01.660
Now what I'm going to
do is compute FFT, fast

00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:03.710
Fourier transform.

00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:05.180
If you know how
to do that great.

00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:07.510
If not, it's an n
log n algorithm.

00:33:07.510 --> 00:33:09.280
So it's an n log in
operations you do.

00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:12.200
I'm just going to write them
down as my sequence of updates.

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:15.340
At the end I have the
fast Fourier transform.

00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:18.280
And the retroactive
thing I'm going to do

00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:23.230
is set all of these words,
all the xi's, and name them.

00:33:23.230 --> 00:33:25.780
Which changes the input to
the fast Fourier transform.

00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:32.200
And it turns out that dynamic
fast Fourier transform,

00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:41.440
where changing one of the
words, xi, you can show,

00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:43.360
or it has been shown--

00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:45.190
we're not going to
prove this here--

00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:49.540
requires at least square
root of n cell-probes.

00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:53.674
So this is about--

00:33:53.674 --> 00:33:55.840
if you change one thing in
a fast Fourier transform,

00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:58.630
it doesn't change
everything, necessarily.

00:33:58.630 --> 00:34:01.330
But the claim is
that you need to look

00:34:01.330 --> 00:34:03.220
at least root n of
the things again,

00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:06.820
in order to figure out what
happened, how the FFT changed.

00:34:06.820 --> 00:34:09.610
So I mention this mostly
as an interesting question

00:34:09.610 --> 00:34:12.310
of whether you can come up
with a better lower bound

00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:13.750
in this data structure.

00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:16.030
Ideally taking some
existing lower bound,

00:34:16.030 --> 00:34:20.469
plugging it in to this kind
of retroactive framework,

00:34:20.469 --> 00:34:25.739
and getting what you want.

00:34:25.739 --> 00:34:27.310
Enough about the bad news.

00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:31.040
I want to go to
positive results again.

00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:33.520
So we had a very
simple thing here.

00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:35.020
Let's try something
that's somewhere

00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:38.980
in between, where there
are chain reactions,

00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:40.612
but it's not impossible.

00:34:40.612 --> 00:34:42.070
So in general, if
you're building--

00:34:42.070 --> 00:34:44.445
if you have a data structure
that represents an arbitrary

00:34:44.445 --> 00:34:46.594
computer, you're
basically hosed.

00:34:46.594 --> 00:34:48.010
If you have a data
structure where

00:34:48.010 --> 00:34:50.949
the operations can be
arbitrarily reordered, pretty

00:34:50.949 --> 00:34:51.699
easy.

00:34:51.699 --> 00:34:59.920
So our intermediate setting will
be priority queues, the example

00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:01.618
I showed at the very beginning.

00:35:10.250 --> 00:35:11.920
So on a priority
queue, I'm going

00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:15.836
to think about two operations,
insert and delete-min.

00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:22.480
This is interesting
because delete-min depends

00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:25.750
on what the current state is.

00:35:25.750 --> 00:35:27.760
So if I insert
something early on,

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:30.730
it can change every delete-min
that happens thereafter,

00:35:30.730 --> 00:35:34.120
and completely change what
happens at the end of the data

00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:36.820
structure.

00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:38.350
So the claim is
we can solve this

00:35:38.350 --> 00:35:46.030
with log n time per
operation, per partially

00:35:46.030 --> 00:35:47.727
retroactive operation.

00:35:51.710 --> 00:35:57.125
It's pretty good because
in this model, which--

00:35:57.125 --> 00:35:58.910
what model are we in here?

00:35:58.910 --> 00:36:02.430
I guess pointer machine
would be a reasonable model?

00:36:02.430 --> 00:36:05.540
Log n is the best you can
hope for a priority queue.

00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:08.560
I guess comparison model
is more relevant then.

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:10.290
So you can use priority
queues to sort.

00:36:10.290 --> 00:36:13.340
So log n is the best you can
do for regular priority queues.

00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:16.460
And so to do it also
partially retroactive

00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:19.460
is pretty interesting.

00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:22.260
How do we do this?

00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:25.730
Well, I don't want to draw
a picture of what these data

00:36:25.730 --> 00:36:26.660
structures look like.

00:36:33.230 --> 00:36:38.630
My picture is keyspace is
going to be the y-axis,

00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:40.730
and time is the x-axis.

00:36:43.410 --> 00:36:45.620
So if someone comes along
and does an insertion,

00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:49.916
they do the insertion at some
time with some key value.

00:36:49.916 --> 00:36:51.290
And so I'm going
to think of that

00:36:51.290 --> 00:36:53.373
as a rightward pointing
ray, because at that point

00:36:53.373 --> 00:36:55.940
that element exists.

00:36:55.940 --> 00:36:59.690
And if nothing happens, it
will exist for the end of time.

00:36:59.690 --> 00:37:02.030
The problem would be if
someone comes along and does

00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:02.790
a delete-min.

00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:08.004
A delete-min is going to be a
ray shooting up from infinity,

00:37:08.004 --> 00:37:09.920
because you always want
to delete the smallest

00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:10.880
possible thing.

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:12.920
So whatever this
ray hits first, that

00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:15.440
is the thing that gets deleted.

00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:16.250
So I want to keep--

00:37:16.250 --> 00:37:19.530
I want to draw all those
rays for the delete-mins.

00:37:19.530 --> 00:37:21.330
So this is a delete-min.

00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:27.410
And this is an insert.

00:37:27.410 --> 00:37:30.359
So I have rightward
rays for insertions.

00:37:30.359 --> 00:37:31.400
They start at some point.

00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:34.460
And I have upward
rays from infinity.

00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:37.400
In general, I'm going to
get a bunch of L shapes.

00:37:52.010 --> 00:37:55.400
And the L's will be non
crossing in a legitimate picture

00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:58.532
of an execution
of the algorithm.

00:37:58.532 --> 00:38:01.380
AUDIENCE: The vertical stuff is
when you're taking the min out?

00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:03.830
ERIK DEMAINE: Yeah the
vertical lines are delete-mins.

00:38:03.830 --> 00:38:05.494
They're coming from below.

00:38:05.494 --> 00:38:07.910
They're taking whatever the
smallest thing is that exists.

00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:10.760
So think about like
this time right here.

00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:13.980
Right now these four elements
are in the data structure.

00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:16.400
You do a delete-min, you
delete the smallest one.

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:18.150
So this guy dies.

00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:19.760
But the three others continue.

00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:22.800
Maybe there'll be some
elements that just exist.

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:24.110
They don't get deleted.

00:38:24.110 --> 00:38:25.490
So it's not entirely L's.

00:38:25.490 --> 00:38:28.370
That's sort of a
half of an L. So you

00:38:28.370 --> 00:38:30.950
might have some L's like that
that just go off to infinity.

00:38:33.770 --> 00:38:35.850
But everyone that's
in an L, this

00:38:35.850 --> 00:38:37.100
is the insertion that made it.

00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:39.014
These are the delete-mins
that deleted it.

00:38:39.014 --> 00:38:41.430
We're not going to do arbitrary
deletes, just delete-mins.

00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:44.110
It's hard enough.

00:38:44.110 --> 00:38:46.380
OK, problem clear?

00:38:46.380 --> 00:38:48.800
So I want to maintain this.

00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:55.850
Let me show you what goes wrong,
the hard part about this data

00:38:55.850 --> 00:38:57.680
structure.

00:38:57.680 --> 00:39:02.660
Let's say I do an insert here.

00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:04.100
New insertion.

00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:06.650
Well, that means that this
delete-min would have returned

00:39:06.650 --> 00:39:08.420
this guy instead of this one.

00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:11.141
So this one would actually
continue to exist.

00:39:11.141 --> 00:39:12.890
So then this delete-min
would have deleted

00:39:12.890 --> 00:39:15.110
this guy instead of that one.

00:39:15.110 --> 00:39:17.070
So this guy continues to exist.

00:39:17.070 --> 00:39:20.710
So this continues to the right.

00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:22.920
This starts exist
until this delete-min,

00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:24.870
and now this one exists.

00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:28.370
OK, and then this one
exists for the rest of time.

00:39:28.370 --> 00:39:31.640
In general, you do a
single retroactive insert,

00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:33.280
everything could change.

00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:35.510
Or a linear number
of guys could change.

00:39:39.302 --> 00:39:41.760
So if you want to maintain this
picture, you're in trouble.

00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:44.187
You get an omega r lower bound.

00:39:44.187 --> 00:39:46.020
So we're not going to
maintain this picture.

00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:47.686
But we're going to
keep it in our minds,

00:39:47.686 --> 00:39:51.030
vaguely, that we wanted to know
something like this picture.

00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:53.940
What we really need to know
is that this element now

00:39:53.940 --> 00:39:55.845
exists in the data structure.

00:39:55.845 --> 00:39:57.720
If I'm just doing partial
retroactivity, what

00:39:57.720 --> 00:40:01.120
I care about is who
exists at the end of time.

00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:04.500
So I'm doing an insert
at a given time t,

00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:08.290
with a given key x.

00:40:08.290 --> 00:40:11.840
And if life was good, you
know, if I was commutative,

00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:13.590
then that would be
equivalent to inserting

00:40:13.590 --> 00:40:15.130
that key x at the end of time.

00:40:15.130 --> 00:40:16.080
But it's not.

00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:17.550
Instead I have to
figure out what

00:40:17.550 --> 00:40:19.740
key gets inserted
at the end when

00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:21.450
I insert this key at this time.

00:40:21.450 --> 00:40:24.200
And similarly for
adding a delete-min.

00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:26.520
I won't try to draw that,
but exactly the same kind

00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:29.680
of chain reactions can happen.

00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:32.610
OK, so we're going to
do this in log n time.

00:40:53.850 --> 00:40:54.960
How do we do it?

00:41:01.130 --> 00:41:04.910
So I'm going to focus on the
insertion case, inserting--

00:41:04.910 --> 00:41:06.440
the double insertion case--

00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:09.166
inserting an insert operation.

00:41:09.166 --> 00:41:11.540
I guess I'm going to switch
notation and call the keys k,

00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:12.590
instead of x.

00:41:12.590 --> 00:41:13.340
It doesn't matter.

00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:24.200
OK, what I'd like
to know is that when

00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:28.712
I do this insertion, what gets
inserted into the final Q?

00:41:28.712 --> 00:41:30.170
I'm going to call
that Q now, being

00:41:30.170 --> 00:41:33.820
the the present, the future,
whatever you want to call it.

00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:46.245
I claim this is
what gets inserted.

00:41:53.530 --> 00:41:55.905
If you look at all the keys
that get deleted from now on,

00:41:55.905 --> 00:41:57.613
and you look at the
key you're inserting,

00:41:57.613 --> 00:41:59.100
you take the max
of all those, that

00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:00.960
will be the one that survives.

00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:02.640
That's pretty obvious.

00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:06.150
The annoying thing is this is
really hard to think about.

00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:08.730
Because who gets deleted
is something that

00:42:08.730 --> 00:42:10.560
is a chain reaction effect.

00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:13.134
What we'd really like to have
is the word inserted there,

00:42:13.134 --> 00:42:15.050
because we know what
things get inserted when.

00:42:15.050 --> 00:42:16.091
Those are the operations.

00:42:16.091 --> 00:42:18.700
We just maintain the list of
operations, we'd know that.

00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:21.510
Deleted is a lot
harder to think about.

00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:25.290
So we need a Lemma
that tells us--

00:42:25.290 --> 00:42:29.160
there's a nice equation that
simplifies this formula for us,

00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:31.030
or this computation.

00:42:31.030 --> 00:42:34.270
For that we need the
notion of a bridge.

00:42:34.270 --> 00:42:37.770
A very simple idea.

00:42:37.770 --> 00:42:45.150
A bridge at time
t is a time when

00:42:45.150 --> 00:42:47.160
everything that's
currently in the queue

00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:48.390
will finally be in the queue.

00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:56.040
So this is a bridge.

00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:57.630
This is a bridge.

00:42:57.630 --> 00:43:01.050
Because these elements
exist for the rest of time.

00:43:01.050 --> 00:43:03.610
This is a bridge.

00:43:03.610 --> 00:43:05.370
OK, these are basically--

00:43:05.370 --> 00:43:07.230
interesting stuff
happens between bridges.

00:43:07.230 --> 00:43:11.430
Bridges are the points of rest
when things are kind of boring.

00:43:11.430 --> 00:43:15.691
We'll need this for
the next statement.

00:43:18.867 --> 00:43:20.700
And the other claim is
it's easy to maintain

00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:21.616
where the bridges are.

00:43:21.616 --> 00:43:23.477
That's not a big surprise.

00:43:23.477 --> 00:43:25.560
Because there's no chain
reactions at the bridges.

00:43:40.330 --> 00:43:42.400
So if I have a time
t that I care about--

00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:45.370
I want to compute this
formula for time t--

00:43:45.370 --> 00:43:47.770
what I do is find
the preceding bridge.

00:43:47.770 --> 00:43:49.610
Call it t prime.

00:43:49.610 --> 00:43:53.002
This is like-- an
arbitrary time t like here,

00:43:53.002 --> 00:43:54.460
we're in the middle
of some action.

00:43:54.460 --> 00:43:55.918
I want to know what
that action is.

00:43:55.918 --> 00:43:58.850
So I want to go to the
preceding blue line.

00:43:58.850 --> 00:44:00.680
So that's t prime.

00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:04.750
If my query is here,
t prime will be there.

00:44:07.550 --> 00:44:14.800
Then, what I want to know is
this max of k prime where k

00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:23.157
prime is deleted after time t.

00:44:27.450 --> 00:44:30.564
I should say greater equal
to t, instead of after,

00:44:30.564 --> 00:44:31.480
a little more precise.

00:44:35.230 --> 00:44:42.660
Claim this equals the
max over all k prime

00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:45.760
not in the final queue,
because those guys obviously

00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:46.270
still exist.

00:44:50.050 --> 00:44:59.930
Where k prime is inserted
at time greater than

00:44:59.930 --> 00:45:02.940
or equal to t prime.

00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:05.930
So basically I can turn the word
deleted into the word inserted,

00:45:05.930 --> 00:45:07.930
if I change t to t prime.

00:45:07.930 --> 00:45:10.770
And I also have to exclude
the guys at the top.

00:45:10.770 --> 00:45:14.247
So we're looking at a
particular time like here.

00:45:14.247 --> 00:45:15.830
I want to know who
are the things that

00:45:15.830 --> 00:45:16.880
are deleted after that.

00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:17.844
Well, this is deleted.

00:45:17.844 --> 00:45:18.510
This is deleted.

00:45:18.510 --> 00:45:21.170
All these guys
are deleted after.

00:45:21.170 --> 00:45:23.807
I'm going to rewind to t
prime and say, well, you

00:45:23.807 --> 00:45:25.640
know there are these
guys that they survive.

00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:27.015
They obviously
don't get deleted.

00:45:27.015 --> 00:45:31.100
But if you ignore the guys
that end up in the final queue,

00:45:31.100 --> 00:45:33.795
the guys that get
deleted after time t

00:45:33.795 --> 00:45:36.170
are the same as the ones that
get inserted after t prime.

00:45:38.792 --> 00:45:39.500
That's the claim.

00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:42.230
Or actually, that set of
elements is not the same,

00:45:42.230 --> 00:45:43.910
but the max will be the same.

00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:45.384
That's all I care about.

00:45:45.384 --> 00:45:46.550
I only want to know the max.

00:45:46.550 --> 00:45:48.320
The max among all
the ones deleted here

00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:51.529
is this upper uppermost segment.

00:45:51.529 --> 00:45:53.570
And that's the same as
the max among all the guys

00:45:53.570 --> 00:45:54.960
that are inserted after here.

00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:57.560
So it's really just a
claim about this one being

00:45:57.560 --> 00:46:01.649
inserted after this bridge.

00:46:01.649 --> 00:46:02.690
I won't prove this Lemma.

00:46:02.690 --> 00:46:05.320
It's just, you think about
it for long enough, it

00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:06.770
becomes obvious.

00:46:06.770 --> 00:46:08.792
Leave it at that.

00:46:08.792 --> 00:46:10.250
Now we can do some
data structures,

00:46:10.250 --> 00:46:12.440
because now we have something
that we can reasonably

00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:13.148
hope to maintain.

00:46:21.220 --> 00:46:23.470
So maintaining
bridges, one thing--

00:46:27.170 --> 00:46:29.910
Yeah, actually kind
of an important thing.

00:46:32.469 --> 00:46:34.010
So here's where
we're going to store.

00:46:34.010 --> 00:46:38.040
We're going to store the current
Q as a balanced binary search

00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:39.620
tree.

00:46:39.620 --> 00:46:43.056
OK, that's not very exciting.

00:46:43.056 --> 00:46:45.450
Though the hard part
is to figure out how

00:46:45.450 --> 00:46:47.630
Q now is changing at each step.

00:46:47.630 --> 00:46:49.890
But this will allow us
to do arbitrary queries

00:46:49.890 --> 00:46:53.280
on the final result

00:46:53.280 --> 00:47:02.760
We want to store a balanced
binary search tree whose leaves

00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:04.230
represent insertions.

00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:10.455
So lowercase insertions.

00:47:10.455 --> 00:47:13.075
So that's all of the
rightward arrows.

00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:18.600
And they're are going
to be sorted by time.

00:47:23.270 --> 00:47:26.540
Not by a key value.

00:47:26.540 --> 00:47:29.160
OK, and I'm going to augment
that balanced binary search

00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:39.540
tree with a fun
value for every node

00:47:39.540 --> 00:47:41.190
in the balanced
binary search tree.

00:47:41.190 --> 00:47:44.820
I want to know max
of all the keys

00:47:44.820 --> 00:47:48.090
not currently in
the queue, or not

00:47:48.090 --> 00:47:50.582
presently in the queue
at the end of time.

00:47:50.582 --> 00:47:53.580
That changes is very slowly,
so this is easy to maintain.

00:47:57.510 --> 00:47:59.340
Among all the keys
that are inserted

00:47:59.340 --> 00:48:04.210
in the subtree rooted at x.

00:48:04.210 --> 00:48:08.220
OK, that's basically this
value, which I want to maintain,

00:48:08.220 --> 00:48:10.350
but split up over a subtree.

00:48:10.350 --> 00:48:12.240
And so that lets me
easily compute this value

00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:18.470
by taking the max of log n
of these values at any time.

00:48:18.470 --> 00:48:23.310
OK, then we store another
balanced binary search tree

00:48:23.310 --> 00:48:25.410
where the leaves
are all the updates.

00:48:31.610 --> 00:48:33.210
Again they will be
ordered by time.

00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:42.792
And they will be augmented.

00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:53.250
In each node, I'm going
to store a number which

00:48:53.250 --> 00:48:55.440
is 0 plus 1 or minus 1.

00:48:55.440 --> 00:48:58.950
It's going to be
0 for an insert.

00:49:01.587 --> 00:49:03.420
This is at the leaf
level because the leaves

00:49:03.420 --> 00:49:06.480
correspond to updates.

00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:11.940
If that key ends up
in the final queue.

00:49:11.940 --> 00:49:14.020
So those we just ignore.

00:49:14.020 --> 00:49:18.630
It's going to be plus 1 for
any other kind of insert.

00:49:21.300 --> 00:49:27.430
Inserting a key where
k is not in Q now.

00:49:27.430 --> 00:49:30.375
And it's going to be
minus 1 for a delete-min.

00:49:35.810 --> 00:49:37.470
I'm going to store this.

00:49:37.470 --> 00:49:41.435
And we're going to
have subtree sums.

00:49:45.330 --> 00:49:49.200
So this is fun
with augmentation.

00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:51.680
Why do I do all that?

00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:57.920
Because if I store
all these numbers,

00:49:57.920 --> 00:50:00.660
it becomes really easy
to detect bridges.

00:50:04.442 --> 00:50:05.434
I claim.

00:50:14.527 --> 00:50:15.360
AUDIENCE: Professor?

00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:16.151
ERIK DEMAINE: Yeah?

00:50:16.151 --> 00:50:19.099
AUDIENCE: So, what we're
looking for is basically

00:50:19.099 --> 00:50:23.874
we know how the cascade
went in any given--

00:50:23.874 --> 00:50:26.290
ERIK DEMAINE: We want to compute
how one of these cascades

00:50:26.290 --> 00:50:26.790
will end.

00:50:26.790 --> 00:50:29.325
AUDIENCE: And so we just always
maintain that information?

00:50:29.325 --> 00:50:31.700
ERIK DEMAINE: We're always
going to maintain what's here.

00:50:31.700 --> 00:50:33.820
We can't afford to
maintain this whole picture

00:50:33.820 --> 00:50:35.800
because it changes too much.

00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:36.960
But we want to--

00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:37.720
we're given this.

00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:39.520
We want to know the
result of the cascade,

00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:42.000
without having to do all
that stuff in the middle.

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:43.530
Yeah, that's our goal.

00:50:43.530 --> 00:50:46.040
And I claim-- this
is a lot of text.

00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:47.800
But I claim that
this information

00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:50.200
is enough to do
that in log n time.

00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:52.620
So let me try to convince you.

00:50:52.620 --> 00:50:55.470
AUDIENCE: So are you storing
several binary searches?

00:50:55.470 --> 00:50:57.960
ERIK DEMAINE: I'm storing three.

00:50:57.960 --> 00:51:00.370
I'm storing one that
represents the final result.

00:51:00.370 --> 00:51:02.920
I'm storing one that's just
looking at the insertions.

00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:05.360
I'm storing one that
looks at all the updates.

00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:07.780
I maintain all three, and
you can cross-link them

00:51:07.780 --> 00:51:10.700
all you want.

00:51:10.700 --> 00:51:18.910
OK, I claim a bridge
is now a prefix

00:51:18.910 --> 00:51:30.250
of updates summing to zero,
according to this measure.

00:51:30.250 --> 00:51:33.730
Because inserts and deletes,
when they all cancel out--

00:51:33.730 --> 00:51:37.990
and if we ignore the things
that finally end up there,

00:51:37.990 --> 00:51:41.200
the periods of rest,
when no one is active

00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:42.820
that will eventually
get deleted,

00:51:42.820 --> 00:51:46.420
that's exactly when everyone
to the left has been deleted

00:51:46.420 --> 00:51:48.080
or will survive to the end.

00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:52.540
So these guys counts as
zeros, so we ignore those.

00:51:52.540 --> 00:51:54.040
Each of these
corresponds to plus 1.

00:51:54.040 --> 00:51:55.980
Each of these
corresponds to a minus 1.

00:51:55.980 --> 00:51:58.460
So these have all
canceled out by now.

00:51:58.460 --> 00:52:00.670
And when this prefix
sum, which is everything

00:52:00.670 --> 00:52:05.170
up to a given point, is
zero, then that is a bridge.

00:52:05.170 --> 00:52:09.700
What this lets you do
is if you have some--

00:52:09.700 --> 00:52:12.070
you have this
binary search tree.

00:52:12.070 --> 00:52:15.160
You have some query time t,
which corresponds to a leaf.

00:52:15.160 --> 00:52:18.490
And now I want to know what
is the preceding bridge?

00:52:18.490 --> 00:52:22.150
I want to know t prime, the
bridge proceeding time t.

00:52:22.150 --> 00:52:24.820
Then basically I
walk up this tree

00:52:24.820 --> 00:52:26.700
and find the preceding moments--

00:52:26.700 --> 00:52:30.520
I actually have to first walk
down to compute all the sums.

00:52:30.520 --> 00:52:33.520
So hanging off on
the left of this path

00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:36.895
are all these times in the past.

00:52:36.895 --> 00:52:42.165
And I say well, if the sum of
all of those subtree sums, sum

00:52:42.165 --> 00:52:44.290
of all the values in those
leaves, if that's 0 then

00:52:44.290 --> 00:52:46.990
we're already at a bridge.

00:52:46.990 --> 00:52:49.990
If not, I basically compute
the preceding point where

00:52:49.990 --> 00:52:52.820
this sum up to that point is 0.

00:52:52.820 --> 00:52:54.940
And that should be
relatively obvious how to do.

00:52:54.940 --> 00:52:58.300
It's a regular kind of
walking up the tree.

00:52:58.300 --> 00:53:02.580
So log n time I can find
the preceding bridge.

00:53:07.450 --> 00:53:09.790
Because I have all
these subtrees sums

00:53:09.790 --> 00:53:19.300
I can do that by a tree walk.

00:53:19.300 --> 00:53:24.370
OK, then it just says
here, "And then you

00:53:24.370 --> 00:53:26.440
can compute the change to Qnow."

00:53:26.440 --> 00:53:29.410
How do we compute
the change to Qnow?

00:53:29.410 --> 00:53:32.950
We have to compute this
max of all the keys

00:53:32.950 --> 00:53:36.230
that are inserted
after time t prime.

00:53:36.230 --> 00:53:38.515
So this was the
tree of all updates.

00:53:41.290 --> 00:53:46.780
And we have another tree, which
is just the tree of insertions.

00:53:46.780 --> 00:53:48.880
And so if we
cross-link time-- so

00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:53.200
we find t prime, where
the prefix sum is zero.

00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:56.260
We map over to t prime here.

00:53:56.260 --> 00:53:58.210
And again we get a
root to leaf path.

00:53:58.210 --> 00:54:00.490
And now we look at all of
the elements hanging off

00:54:00.490 --> 00:54:03.082
the right side.

00:54:03.082 --> 00:54:04.540
Those are all the
elements that are

00:54:04.540 --> 00:54:06.430
inserted after time t prime.

00:54:06.430 --> 00:54:07.870
And I just take
the max of those.

00:54:07.870 --> 00:54:09.328
So I guess I didn't
write it, but I

00:54:09.328 --> 00:54:10.760
need to store our subtree--

00:54:10.760 --> 00:54:12.190
oh no, I store this.

00:54:12.190 --> 00:54:13.615
Right, this is what I want.

00:54:13.615 --> 00:54:14.990
For every subtree,
I want to know

00:54:14.990 --> 00:54:16.573
the max of the things
in that subtree,

00:54:16.573 --> 00:54:20.680
but ignoring the guys
that are in Qnow.

00:54:20.680 --> 00:54:25.550
I take all those maxes
on all those subtrees.

00:54:25.550 --> 00:54:36.190
And I can find what element
gets inserted into Qnow in log n

00:54:36.190 --> 00:54:37.159
time.

00:54:37.159 --> 00:54:39.450
Then, of course, I have to
update all this information.

00:54:39.450 --> 00:54:41.140
And I don't want
to spend any more

00:54:41.140 --> 00:54:44.170
time on this, no pun intended.

00:54:44.170 --> 00:54:46.750
You have to-- then Qnow changes.

00:54:46.750 --> 00:54:50.560
And so you've got to update all
these values and these values.

00:54:50.560 --> 00:54:53.830
But the claim is that you can
do all that in log n time.

00:54:53.830 --> 00:54:56.730
It's not hard.

00:54:56.730 --> 00:54:58.380
OK, that's priority queues.

00:54:58.380 --> 00:55:00.450
So I know that was a
little bit tedious.

00:55:00.450 --> 00:55:02.626
But this is sort of--

00:55:02.626 --> 00:55:04.750
it's not quite the coolest
thing we know how to do,

00:55:04.750 --> 00:55:06.800
but it was the first
cool thing we knew how

00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:08.190
to do in the retroactive world.

00:55:08.190 --> 00:55:11.400
It's this nice borderline
where it looks scary.

00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:13.680
There are linear-sized
chain reactions.

00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:18.840
Yet we can still deal
with them in log n time.

00:55:18.840 --> 00:55:24.000
So not quite the worst
case, but also not easy.

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:26.490
So in general, if you want
a retroactive data structure

00:55:26.490 --> 00:55:29.880
for your favorite
data structure,

00:55:29.880 --> 00:55:32.130
you're going to have to
think along these lines,

00:55:32.130 --> 00:55:36.600
see whether you can maintain
something reasonable.

00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:42.030
Let me tell you briefly about
other problems, other data

00:55:42.030 --> 00:55:44.350
structures that we've looked
at, and other people have

00:55:44.350 --> 00:55:44.850
looked at.

00:55:50.140 --> 00:55:55.830
So a simple one is a queue,
first in, first out first in,

00:55:55.830 --> 00:55:56.690
last out.

00:55:56.690 --> 00:55:58.020
One of those.

00:55:58.020 --> 00:56:00.390
I've got stacks too, probably.

00:56:00.390 --> 00:56:03.780
You can do constant time
partial retroactivity.

00:56:03.780 --> 00:56:09.584
Log n time full
retroactivity for a deque.

00:56:09.584 --> 00:56:12.000
I mentioned this last time
where you can insert and delete

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:13.680
from either end.

00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:21.220
We can do log n full
retroactivity for union-find.

00:56:24.360 --> 00:56:25.440
You have a bunch of sets.

00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:26.790
You want to be able
to take their union.

00:56:26.790 --> 00:56:29.380
And given an element you want
to know which set it's in.

00:56:29.380 --> 00:56:32.980
It's sometimes taught in 6046.

00:56:32.980 --> 00:56:38.316
The best thing we know is
log m fully retroactive.

00:56:41.970 --> 00:56:43.851
Priority queue we
already talked about.

00:56:43.851 --> 00:56:44.350
But--

00:56:44.350 --> 00:56:46.150
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:56:46.150 --> 00:56:49.565
ERIK DEMAINE: Is
there a question?

00:56:49.565 --> 00:56:51.854
Priority queue, we already
did partial retroactivity.

00:56:51.854 --> 00:56:53.520
But what if you want
full retroactivity?

00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:55.550
This is pretty much
an open problem.

00:56:55.550 --> 00:56:59.700
Best thing we know is square
root of m to m's log n.

00:56:59.700 --> 00:57:01.639
This is via-- we have
a general result that

00:57:01.639 --> 00:57:03.930
says if you have anything
that's partially retroactive,

00:57:03.930 --> 00:57:05.580
you can make it
fully retroactive

00:57:05.580 --> 00:57:09.180
at a huge cost of
square root of m factor.

00:57:09.180 --> 00:57:12.560
So you could take what we have,
make it fully retroactive.

00:57:12.560 --> 00:57:13.780
Full.

00:57:13.780 --> 00:57:16.365
AUDIENCE: Is there any
difference when you're

00:57:16.365 --> 00:57:19.387
talking about n [INAUDIBLE]

00:57:19.387 --> 00:57:20.970
ERIK DEMAINE: n, I
think it's supposed

00:57:20.970 --> 00:57:25.339
to be the current size
of the data structure.

00:57:25.339 --> 00:57:26.880
I'm not actually
sure what that means

00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:28.110
with a retroactive operation.

00:57:28.110 --> 00:57:30.510
I'll just make them all m's.

00:57:30.510 --> 00:57:33.250
I think that's safer.

00:57:33.250 --> 00:57:34.730
Other question or same one?

00:57:34.730 --> 00:57:38.780
OK good, thank you.

00:57:38.780 --> 00:57:41.237
OK, let me tell you about
the most important problem

00:57:41.237 --> 00:57:41.820
in this field.

00:57:44.730 --> 00:57:46.440
This is actually
what motivated us

00:57:46.440 --> 00:57:50.310
to define retroactivity,
which is a particular problem,

00:57:50.310 --> 00:57:51.750
retroactive successor.

00:57:51.750 --> 00:57:56.040
So successor problem is I want
to be able to insert and delete

00:57:56.040 --> 00:57:58.500
keys in one dimension.

00:57:58.500 --> 00:58:00.690
And given a query
key, I want to know

00:58:00.690 --> 00:58:02.640
what is the next key
greater or equal to it.

00:58:02.640 --> 00:58:04.181
This is something
you can do in log n

00:58:04.181 --> 00:58:06.580
time with a balanced
binary search tree.

00:58:06.580 --> 00:58:08.080
There's lots of
other ways to do it,

00:58:08.080 --> 00:58:10.050
which we will get to
later in this class.

00:58:10.050 --> 00:58:13.170
But what if I want to
do it fully retroactive?

00:58:13.170 --> 00:58:15.420
Partially retroactive
is really easy,

00:58:15.420 --> 00:58:20.100
because this is
a search problem.

00:58:20.100 --> 00:58:25.550
So I can definitely do log
m partial retroactivity.

00:58:28.540 --> 00:58:30.235
In fact, it is a--

00:58:30.235 --> 00:58:33.900
I just use a regular binary
search tree, or whatever.

00:58:33.900 --> 00:58:37.350
In fact, it is a
decomposable search problem.

00:58:37.350 --> 00:58:39.920
So I get full
retroactivity, no problem.

00:58:39.920 --> 00:58:41.760
But I pay a log
factor, so I get log

00:58:41.760 --> 00:58:45.870
squared m, full retroactivity.

00:58:45.870 --> 00:58:50.640
And so that's where we
left it, back in 2003.

00:58:50.640 --> 00:58:52.290
But there's a new
result, which is

00:58:52.290 --> 00:58:56.170
that you can actually get
log m without the square full

00:58:56.170 --> 00:58:58.680
retroactivity.

00:58:58.680 --> 00:59:03.370
This is a complicated result.
It's by Goran and Kaplan, 2009.

00:59:03.370 --> 00:59:06.060
It uses fun techniques like
fractional cascading, which

00:59:06.060 --> 00:59:11.400
is next lecture, and van Emde
Boas, which is lecture 11,

00:59:11.400 --> 00:59:14.560
and various other tools.

00:59:14.560 --> 00:59:17.790
So it's a little too
advanced to cover now.

00:59:17.790 --> 00:59:19.500
But it's cool.

00:59:19.500 --> 00:59:21.960
And it has lots of applications
in geometry, which we will

00:59:21.960 --> 00:59:23.580
be talking about next class.

00:59:23.580 --> 00:59:27.790
So hold your breath
for that, I guess.

00:59:27.790 --> 00:59:28.980
Yeah.

00:59:28.980 --> 00:59:32.640
I want to go to one
last topic, which

00:59:32.640 --> 01:00:28.330
is a different kind
of retro activity

01:00:28.330 --> 01:00:32.300
Nonoblivious retroactivity is
introduced by Acar, Blelloch,

01:00:32.300 --> 01:00:36.320
Tangwongsan in 2007.

01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:38.900
And it's basically
answering the question

01:00:38.900 --> 01:00:40.610
"What about my queries?"

01:00:40.610 --> 01:00:44.720
So we have this
timeline of updates.

01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:47.810
And we've done
various operations

01:00:47.810 --> 01:00:51.924
on our data structure,
which are the updates.

01:00:51.924 --> 01:00:53.840
And we've considered how
those can be changed.

01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:56.150
And then with queries, either
we're querying at the end

01:00:56.150 --> 01:00:57.282
or querying in the middle.

01:00:57.282 --> 01:00:59.240
But we're always getting
sort of instantaneous,

01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:03.200
as the timeline exists
right now, here's what

01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:05.120
the result of your query is.

01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:07.190
But what if I want to do--

01:01:07.190 --> 01:01:10.370
I mean, if I really-- normally
when I use a data structure,

01:01:10.370 --> 01:01:11.630
I do some updates.

01:01:11.630 --> 01:01:13.550
I do some queries.

01:01:13.550 --> 01:01:17.030
I do a combination
of these things.

01:01:17.030 --> 01:01:21.320
And to make life worse,
when I do a query,

01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:23.090
the result of that
query probably

01:01:23.090 --> 01:01:25.530
influences what updates
I do in the future.

01:01:25.530 --> 01:01:28.060
So real use, I'll just
call that the algorithmic

01:01:28.060 --> 01:01:29.543
use of a data structure.

01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:41.622
Results of queries
influence updates,

01:01:41.622 --> 01:01:42.830
what updates are going to do.

01:01:47.370 --> 01:01:52.557
OK, and now this gets a
little dicey, because what

01:01:52.557 --> 01:01:53.390
does influence mean?

01:01:53.390 --> 01:01:56.360
We don't know, because
that's the user somehow

01:01:56.360 --> 01:01:59.310
depends on these results.

01:01:59.310 --> 01:02:02.780
So nonoblivious retroactivity is
trying to deal with this issue.

01:02:02.780 --> 01:02:05.190
Can we get something reasonable?

01:02:05.190 --> 01:02:07.370
So what we'd like to
do is say, oh I now

01:02:07.370 --> 01:02:10.220
add an update over
here, retroactively.

01:02:10.220 --> 01:02:13.300
So their updates are
the same, in some sense.

01:02:13.300 --> 01:02:18.260
You can retroactively insert and
delete updates and queries now.

01:02:18.260 --> 01:02:21.980
I'd like to know well, did the
result of this query change?

01:02:21.980 --> 01:02:23.150
Maybe you can show--

01:02:23.150 --> 01:02:24.920
at the data structure
level we can tell

01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:27.260
did that query result change.

01:02:27.260 --> 01:02:30.980
Maybe this one changed,
but this one did not.

01:02:30.980 --> 01:02:32.510
What we'd like to
report to the user

01:02:32.510 --> 01:02:36.080
is what is the first
query that changed,

01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:38.790
because that's like the
first mistake that you made.

01:02:38.790 --> 01:02:40.640
Like oh you know,
retroactively oops

01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:43.610
I should have deposited
$100 back here.

01:02:43.610 --> 01:02:45.620
And then these
queries which we're

01:02:45.620 --> 01:02:48.200
checking whether the balance
was positive or negative,

01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:52.130
some of their results might
change, some of them might not.

01:02:52.130 --> 01:02:54.500
If they change, then
the algorithm has to--

01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:56.600
I mean, it doesn't have
to rerun these operations,

01:02:56.600 --> 01:02:59.000
because that's what
retroactivity buys for you.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:02.120
But it has to say, oh well,
now this query has changed.

01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:05.580
And then you have to rerun
the algorithm from that point.

01:03:05.580 --> 01:03:07.940
But not necessarily entirely.

01:03:07.940 --> 01:03:10.714
I mean, you look at
that and say, oh,

01:03:10.714 --> 01:03:12.380
did that query actually
change anything?

01:03:12.380 --> 01:03:14.120
This is now the algorithm.

01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:17.840
Oh yeah, instead of this
update here, I would have made

01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:20.060
a different update u prime.

01:03:20.060 --> 01:03:21.810
Well, that's good, we
know how to do that.

01:03:21.810 --> 01:03:23.610
That's a retroactive update.

01:03:23.610 --> 01:03:25.970
So I can delete this
operation retroactively

01:03:25.970 --> 01:03:27.775
and insert this one.

01:03:27.775 --> 01:03:29.900
So in general, what we
assume the algorithm does is

01:03:29.900 --> 01:03:32.810
it looks at the
first error, which is

01:03:32.810 --> 01:03:35.130
reported by our data structure.

01:03:35.130 --> 01:03:38.690
And then it then may
make various changes

01:03:38.690 --> 01:03:41.266
from that point onward,
but always monotonically

01:03:41.266 --> 01:03:42.640
left to right, as
if it was rerun

01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:47.670
in the algorithm, but just
changing what needed to change,

01:03:47.670 --> 01:03:49.860
until all the
errors are resolved.

01:03:49.860 --> 01:03:52.920
All the queries have been
corrected to the right answers.

01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:54.450
Then it can do
whatever it wants.

01:03:54.450 --> 01:03:57.860
Then it can do retroactive
operation anytime in the past.

01:03:57.860 --> 01:04:01.050
OK, so this is an assumption.

01:04:01.050 --> 01:04:15.150
Assume once there's an error,
that the algorithm makes

01:04:15.150 --> 01:04:26.220
changes, retroactive
updates, from left to right.

01:04:31.260 --> 01:04:41.460
And also going to assume that
it does it at times less than

01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:42.555
or equal to all errors.

01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:50.920
So in general, you
have a timeline.

01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:56.280
And then there are some errors
where bad queries were done.

01:04:56.280 --> 01:04:57.919
Naturally, you
would go right here

01:04:57.919 --> 01:04:59.460
and fix the first
error, because that

01:04:59.460 --> 01:05:01.540
may influence other errors.

01:05:01.540 --> 01:05:03.260
And maybe you have--

01:05:03.260 --> 01:05:04.770
so then you make that change.

01:05:04.770 --> 01:05:06.600
Maybe then that causes
some other changes

01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:09.370
right after or
somewhere in between.

01:05:09.370 --> 01:05:12.270
But then I don't want
to make a change here,

01:05:12.270 --> 01:05:14.610
because that would be
depending on this result, which

01:05:14.610 --> 01:05:15.290
was incorrect.

01:05:15.290 --> 01:05:17.280
So first you have to fix this.

01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:20.550
So you keep going to the right
and you visit all the stars.

01:05:20.550 --> 01:05:23.962
That's this assumption.

01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:28.920
This is a very different
kind of retroactivity.

01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:34.140
I would say it's more about
maintaining this exact picture

01:05:34.140 --> 01:05:38.160
of what's happening, but
being able to teleport over

01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:40.320
the uninteresting stuff.

01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:43.950
So in this picture, if
we're doing priority queues

01:05:43.950 --> 01:05:45.990
like this, when I
make this change,

01:05:45.990 --> 01:05:47.130
well, that query changes.

01:05:47.130 --> 01:05:48.310
That query changes.

01:05:48.310 --> 01:05:52.740
The delete-mins, the mins
that they're deleting change.

01:05:52.740 --> 01:05:54.150
So here they were just updates.

01:05:54.150 --> 01:05:57.057
But if there's also a query
here, which is what is the min,

01:05:57.057 --> 01:05:58.890
then all of these query
values would change.

01:06:02.420 --> 01:06:05.390
So you're forced
now to pay for that.

01:06:05.390 --> 01:06:07.520
So in some sense,
it gets easier.

01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:08.290
Let's say.

01:06:08.290 --> 01:06:11.210
For a lot of problems this kind
of retroactivity is easier.

01:06:11.210 --> 01:06:13.220
But for many problems,
it's also more useful.

01:06:13.220 --> 01:06:16.640
So their example is what if you
want to do a dynamic Dijkstra?

01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:18.130
So you have
Dijkstra's algorithm,

01:06:18.130 --> 01:06:21.120
and then you say, oh, actually
this edge weight was wrong.

01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:22.941
So you run Dijkstra's
algorithm once.

01:06:22.941 --> 01:06:24.940
You've got a priority
queue in there telling you

01:06:24.940 --> 01:06:26.740
which vertex is next.

01:06:29.251 --> 01:06:31.000
And now you say, OK,
I changed this weight

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.680
at the beginning of time.

01:06:32.680 --> 01:06:34.690
I don't want to have to
rerun Dijkstra entirely

01:06:34.690 --> 01:06:36.040
if nothing changes.

01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:38.240
Maybe that weight was
completely irrelevant.

01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:40.422
If you just do a
retroactive update and see

01:06:40.422 --> 01:06:42.880
did any of the query results
change, if they didn't change,

01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:44.421
then great you have
the right answer.

01:06:44.421 --> 01:06:46.090
If they did change,
the results change.

01:06:46.090 --> 01:06:48.970
And so you have to know
for every wrong query

01:06:48.970 --> 01:06:51.520
that oh, I really had to
change the shortest pathway.

01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:53.440
It's not this, it's now this.

01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:55.099
But hopefully,
you will only have

01:06:55.099 --> 01:06:56.890
to change a very small
amount if your graph

01:06:56.890 --> 01:06:58.900
didn't change in a big way.

01:06:58.900 --> 01:07:02.680
So it's hard to proof results
about that, but at least

01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:05.050
this would let you dynamize
almost any algorithm that's

01:07:05.050 --> 01:07:06.220
using the data structure.

01:07:06.220 --> 01:07:10.960
So it's easier, but useful for
that kind of transformation.

01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:16.420
OK, let me give you an example,
which is priority queues.

01:07:16.420 --> 01:07:20.679
There's a bunch of results in
their paper, but for symmetry.

01:07:20.679 --> 01:07:21.970
Tell you about priority queues.

01:07:21.970 --> 01:07:24.440
This will look completely
different, so don't worry.

01:07:27.150 --> 01:07:30.470
Operations-- well, the
visual picture is the same,

01:07:30.470 --> 01:07:33.950
but the data structuring is
all completely different.

01:07:33.950 --> 01:07:36.990
They can do all
these things in log m

01:07:36.990 --> 01:07:41.050
per retroactive operation.

01:07:41.050 --> 01:07:43.780
Now there's no notion
of full and partial.

01:07:43.780 --> 01:07:46.420
It's just nonoblivious
retroactivity.

01:07:46.420 --> 01:07:48.820
I didn't write it here, but
the data structure always

01:07:48.820 --> 01:07:52.255
maintains what is the
earliest error currently.

01:07:55.510 --> 01:08:02.570
Maintain the earliest
in time error.

01:08:02.570 --> 01:08:05.410
That error is a query that
used to return one result,

01:08:05.410 --> 01:08:09.180
now returns a new result.

01:08:09.180 --> 01:08:16.910
OK we have a similar picture.

01:08:16.910 --> 01:08:19.185
So I cheated-- I've changed
things a little bit.

01:08:19.185 --> 01:08:19.810
I didn't cheat.

01:08:19.810 --> 01:08:22.670
It's just a slight discrepancy.

01:08:22.670 --> 01:08:25.675
For retroactive, regular
retroactive, insert and

01:08:25.675 --> 01:08:27.050
delete-min were
more interesting,

01:08:27.050 --> 01:08:28.675
because then they
were chain reactions.

01:08:28.675 --> 01:08:31.279
In this world you don't have
to combine delete and min.

01:08:31.279 --> 01:08:33.890
You could consider
delete separate from min.

01:08:33.890 --> 01:08:36.632
Because now, updates are
allowed to depend on queries.

01:08:36.632 --> 01:08:38.090
So maybe you compute
a min and then

01:08:38.090 --> 01:08:40.010
you decide to delete that thing.

01:08:40.010 --> 01:08:42.439
If the min changes, well then,
the thing that got deleted

01:08:42.439 --> 01:08:43.229
might also change.

01:08:43.229 --> 01:08:45.560
That's the algorithm's choice.

01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:47.580
What to do.

01:08:47.580 --> 01:08:50.689
So in this new world of insert,
delete, and min, slightly more

01:08:50.689 --> 01:08:56.050
general, if you look at an item,
it gets inserted at some time.

01:08:56.050 --> 01:08:57.492
It might get deleted
at some time.

01:08:57.492 --> 01:08:59.075
Sometimes it might
go off to infinity,

01:08:59.075 --> 01:09:01.729
if it never gets deleted.

01:09:01.729 --> 01:09:07.290
OK, this is our new picture of
the priority queue over time.

01:09:07.290 --> 01:09:10.100
So again, this is the time axis.

01:09:10.100 --> 01:09:12.760
And this is the key value.

01:09:12.760 --> 01:09:14.310
So have some inserts, deletes.

01:09:14.310 --> 01:09:16.460
They're all corresponding
points in here.

01:09:16.460 --> 01:09:19.700
And then you have min queries,
which maybe I will draw in red.

01:09:22.649 --> 01:09:26.550
So min query would be
something like this.

01:09:26.550 --> 01:09:28.920
Give me what is the lowest
segment at this time.

01:09:34.100 --> 01:09:35.580
So that's my sequence
of operations

01:09:35.580 --> 01:09:37.706
is the projection onto
time, so there's this thing.

01:09:37.706 --> 01:09:38.705
Then there's this query.

01:09:38.705 --> 01:09:39.965
Then there's this insertion.

01:09:39.965 --> 01:09:41.090
Then there's this deletion.

01:09:41.090 --> 01:09:42.215
Then there's this deletion.

01:09:42.215 --> 01:09:43.215
Then there's this query.

01:09:43.215 --> 01:09:44.839
Min query, then
there's this insertion.

01:09:44.839 --> 01:09:45.910
Then there's this query.

01:09:45.910 --> 01:09:47.034
Then there's this deletion.

01:09:47.034 --> 01:09:49.479
You get the idea.

01:09:49.479 --> 01:09:51.240
But this is a way to
two-dimensionalize

01:09:51.240 --> 01:09:53.259
that picture.

01:09:53.259 --> 01:09:55.050
AUDIENCE: Can you delete
without the query?

01:09:55.050 --> 01:09:56.158
ERIK DEMAINE: Sorry?

01:09:56.158 --> 01:09:58.600
AUDIENCE: Can you delete
without the query?

01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:02.484
ERIK DEMAINE: You can delete
without a query in this model.

01:10:02.484 --> 01:10:03.900
Make our life a
little bit harder.

01:10:03.900 --> 01:10:07.690
Now what we need to support
are capital insert, and capital

01:10:07.690 --> 01:10:10.780
delete, retroactive insert
and delete, of all three

01:10:10.780 --> 01:10:11.646
of these operations.

01:10:11.646 --> 01:10:12.770
Before it was just updates.

01:10:12.770 --> 01:10:15.660
Now we can insert
and delete queries.

01:10:15.660 --> 01:10:17.180
A little harder to think about.

01:10:17.180 --> 01:10:20.270
But it can be done.

01:10:20.270 --> 01:10:22.264
So for example, let's just--

01:10:22.264 --> 01:10:23.680
I'm not going to
do all the cases,

01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:25.670
because there's a lot of them.

01:10:25.670 --> 01:10:30.580
Let's say I delete
this deletion.

01:10:30.580 --> 01:10:33.310
OK, that means that this
will just go to the right.

01:10:37.550 --> 01:10:41.620
OK, that's bad, because it
changes all of these queries.

01:10:41.620 --> 01:10:43.750
All of these queries
are now incorrect.

01:10:43.750 --> 01:10:46.090
We're just going to keep
the picture like this

01:10:46.090 --> 01:10:47.787
and remember that
there are errors.

01:10:47.787 --> 01:10:49.870
And we'll be able to
maintain at every moment what

01:10:49.870 --> 01:10:51.760
is the next error.

01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:55.000
The errors are these crossings.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:55.750
Crossings are bad.

01:10:55.750 --> 01:10:58.270
That means you have
the wrong picture.

01:10:58.270 --> 01:10:59.820
But we'll wait for
the algorithm--

01:10:59.820 --> 01:11:01.690
we'll tell the algorithm
this is the next crossing.

01:11:01.690 --> 01:11:04.148
And it's going to have to fix
it by say deleting that query

01:11:04.148 --> 01:11:05.230
and then reinserting it.

01:11:05.230 --> 01:11:06.760
Then it will get
the correct result.

01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:08.620
But it might do other
updates meanwhile.

01:11:08.620 --> 01:11:12.100
So let's not try to fix them
all now because they may change.

01:11:12.100 --> 01:11:14.950
Maybe they'll decide to
re-insert a deletion here

01:11:14.950 --> 01:11:17.565
to do that, and then erase
all of those crossings,

01:11:17.565 --> 01:11:20.210
if we're lucky.

01:11:20.210 --> 01:11:22.270
You might also
insert an insertion.

01:11:22.270 --> 01:11:24.640
That's basically the same
as deleting a deletion.

01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:26.220
You get a whole
bunch of crossings.

01:11:30.050 --> 01:11:32.680
Inserting an insertion
and deleting a deletion

01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:34.330
are about the same.

01:11:34.330 --> 01:11:36.880
So the other case is
inserting a deletion

01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:40.670
or deleting an insertion.

01:11:40.670 --> 01:11:44.200
So inserting a deletion.

01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:48.170
Let's say that I
insert a deletion here.

01:11:48.170 --> 01:11:51.220
So now suddenly this
thing ceases to exist.

01:11:51.220 --> 01:11:52.540
All of this is gone.

01:11:52.540 --> 01:11:54.280
We get not a crossing
error, but we

01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:56.494
get what I'll call a
floating air, which

01:11:56.494 --> 01:11:58.660
is that these guys are
currently returning something

01:11:58.660 --> 01:12:02.290
that there's no segment there.

01:12:02.290 --> 01:12:06.100
OK, so we can get crossing
errors and floating errors.

01:12:14.660 --> 01:12:16.660
I want to give you enough
of this data structure

01:12:16.660 --> 01:12:20.050
to show that actually you use
these data structures to solve

01:12:20.050 --> 01:12:22.247
it.

01:12:22.247 --> 01:12:24.455
So in that sense, it's
actually not that much easier.

01:12:24.455 --> 01:12:25.996
I said it was easier,
but we're going

01:12:25.996 --> 01:12:31.840
to need a retroactive successor
in order to solve this problem.

01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:34.295
OK, some variants.

01:12:46.836 --> 01:12:48.210
Man, who used this
colored chalk?

01:12:48.210 --> 01:12:49.170
It's so hard to erase.

01:13:03.740 --> 01:13:13.796
Let's say I want to maintain
the lowest leftmost crossing.

01:13:20.341 --> 01:13:22.590
So in this picture, where I
have a bunch of crossings,

01:13:22.590 --> 01:13:25.690
this is the one I want to
maintain, the bottom left one.

01:13:25.690 --> 01:13:27.450
Now there's a bit
of a subtlety here,

01:13:27.450 --> 01:13:29.984
which is do you do you
minimize y-coordinate

01:13:29.984 --> 01:13:30.900
and then x-coordinate?

01:13:30.900 --> 01:13:31.680
Or vice versa?

01:13:31.680 --> 01:13:33.263
It turns out these
are the same thing.

01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:40.590
I don't want to prove that here,
but because of this assumption

01:13:40.590 --> 01:13:44.110
that we're always proceeding
monotonically left to right,

01:13:44.110 --> 01:13:47.520
we have a nice invariant that if
you look at all the crossings,

01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:51.144
they involve segments that
start to the left of all errors.

01:13:51.144 --> 01:13:52.560
Because all the
changes we've made

01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:56.010
are to the left of all
errors by this property.

01:13:56.010 --> 01:13:57.660
And so it's really
just a whole bunch

01:13:57.660 --> 01:14:00.840
of rays coming in from
negative infinity on the left,

01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:03.630
and a whole bunch of rays
coming from minus infinity

01:14:03.630 --> 01:14:05.010
on the bottom.

01:14:05.010 --> 01:14:07.200
Sometimes the rays stop.

01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:08.860
But if you look at
where they cross,

01:14:08.860 --> 01:14:11.730
there's a uniquely defined
bottom left corner.

01:14:11.730 --> 01:14:16.482
OK, so that's this picture.

01:14:16.482 --> 01:14:21.090
Those rays might go different
amounts from either side,

01:14:21.090 --> 01:14:24.910
but there is a single
lower left corner.

01:14:24.910 --> 01:14:26.890
So we're going to maintain that.

01:14:26.890 --> 01:14:38.220
And we're also going to maintain
the leftmost floating point,

01:14:38.220 --> 01:14:44.330
floating error, on
each row separately.

01:14:44.330 --> 01:14:46.949
So in each horizontal
line, like here,

01:14:46.949 --> 01:14:48.990
we'll maintain that there's
a floating error here

01:14:48.990 --> 01:14:49.980
for this row.

01:14:49.980 --> 01:14:53.200
But we won't figure out
that one till later.

01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:55.880
That just saves the
work we have to do.

01:14:55.880 --> 01:15:06.360
OK, now let me show you an
operation let's do insert min.

01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:07.236
So I want to--

01:15:07.236 --> 01:15:08.610
I'm going to use
x for time here,

01:15:08.610 --> 01:15:10.680
because it's a little
bit more intuitive.

01:15:10.680 --> 01:15:12.660
X-coordinate is time.

01:15:12.660 --> 01:15:14.430
Suppose I want to
insert a query.

01:15:14.430 --> 01:15:17.580
This is actually an easy
case because there's

01:15:17.580 --> 01:15:19.056
no chain reactions here.

01:15:19.056 --> 01:15:21.680
It's going to be correct because
I'm doing the query right now.

01:15:21.680 --> 01:15:24.300
This is basically a
fully retroactive query.

01:15:24.300 --> 01:15:26.950
I'm adding a new
time, a new query,

01:15:26.950 --> 01:15:29.220
and I want to know what is
the first ray that I hit.

01:15:32.830 --> 01:15:33.760
How do I solve that?

01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:43.380
So what's going on here is
I'm basically manipulating

01:15:43.380 --> 01:15:46.020
these line segments.

01:15:46.020 --> 01:15:50.070
I mean, the red lines don't
really affect this query.

01:15:50.070 --> 01:15:51.337
They just might be incorrect.

01:15:51.337 --> 01:15:52.920
But I don't care if
they're incorrect.

01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:54.270
I just want to know
for this query, what

01:15:54.270 --> 01:15:55.186
is the lowest segment?

01:15:55.186 --> 01:15:56.560
So really, I have segments.

01:15:56.560 --> 01:15:57.510
They're changing.

01:15:57.510 --> 01:16:00.280
Inserting and deleting
endpoints of the segments.

01:16:00.280 --> 01:16:03.330
And I want to know
from below, what is

01:16:03.330 --> 01:16:05.190
the first segment that I hit?

01:16:05.190 --> 01:16:08.810
This is called
upward ray-shooting.

01:16:08.810 --> 01:16:10.620
Or vertical
ray-shooting, I guess,

01:16:10.620 --> 01:16:12.960
would be the normal
phrasing, but I want

01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:14.390
to be a little more specific.

01:16:14.390 --> 01:16:17.610
Not downward upward.

01:16:17.610 --> 01:16:18.975
Among dynamic segments.

01:16:22.589 --> 01:16:23.880
This is a well-studied problem.

01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:30.110
And conveniently, it can
be solved in log n time

01:16:30.110 --> 01:16:30.750
preparation.

01:16:30.750 --> 01:16:35.850
So you can modify segments and
do upward ray-shooting queries

01:16:35.850 --> 01:16:37.620
in log n type preparation.

01:16:37.620 --> 01:16:40.590
But you already knew that.

01:16:40.590 --> 01:16:42.630
Good, you're nodding your head.

01:16:42.630 --> 01:16:45.030
Because that is
retroactive successor,

01:16:45.030 --> 01:16:46.520
if you think about it.

01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:49.950
A retroactive insertion
operation in the past

01:16:49.950 --> 01:16:52.620
is like its fully
retroactive successor.

01:16:52.620 --> 01:16:55.260
That's this result.

01:16:55.260 --> 01:16:57.720
Inserting an insertion,
that's like creating

01:16:57.720 --> 01:16:59.670
a new left endpoint
point of a segment.

01:16:59.670 --> 01:17:02.230
Inserting a deletion is like
creating a new right endpoint.

01:17:02.230 --> 01:17:05.400
Deleting a deletion or
deleting an insertion,

01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:07.870
you could use that
to move the endpoint.

01:17:07.870 --> 01:17:12.600
So that's exactly dynamic
segments, horizontal segments.

01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:15.660
And then shooting a ray is--

01:17:15.660 --> 01:17:18.015
in general-- a general
ray-shooting query

01:17:18.015 --> 01:17:18.780
is like this.

01:17:18.780 --> 01:17:20.670
I can be not from
minus infinity,

01:17:20.670 --> 01:17:24.840
be at an arbitrary point, and
ask, what do I hit upward next?

01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:29.259
That is like at this time
doing a successor query.

01:17:29.259 --> 01:17:31.050
OK, now this is a
special kind of successor

01:17:31.050 --> 01:17:33.224
query, because it's always
from minus infinity.

01:17:33.224 --> 01:17:34.890
So you might be able
to solve it easier.

01:17:34.890 --> 01:17:39.610
But in particular, you can
solve it using this result.

01:17:39.610 --> 01:17:43.710
So regular retroactivity
helps you do nonoblivious

01:17:43.710 --> 01:17:45.828
retroactivity.

01:17:45.828 --> 01:17:46.328
Cool.

01:17:53.090 --> 01:17:54.860
We're out of time.

01:17:54.860 --> 01:18:00.686
So I will just say, the
other cases are similar.

01:18:00.686 --> 01:18:02.310
There's one other
thing you need to do,

01:18:02.310 --> 01:18:04.490
which is in addition
to upward ray-shooting,

01:18:04.490 --> 01:18:06.747
you have to do rightward
ray-shooting because

01:18:06.747 --> 01:18:07.580
of things like this.

01:18:07.580 --> 01:18:09.020
If I delete this
deletion, I want

01:18:09.020 --> 01:18:10.394
to know what do I hit next.

01:18:10.394 --> 01:18:11.810
So that's a rightward
ray-shooting

01:18:11.810 --> 01:18:13.730
among dynamic segments,
which all happen

01:18:13.730 --> 01:18:15.530
to start at minus infinity.

01:18:15.530 --> 01:18:20.050
So it's again-- it's dynamic
ray-shooting, or successor

01:18:20.050 --> 01:18:23.450
queries, but in x instead of y.

01:18:23.450 --> 01:18:25.310
So with those tricks,
you can do all

01:18:25.310 --> 01:18:27.410
of the cases of
inserting deleting,

01:18:27.410 --> 01:18:31.850
deleting insertions,
inserting, all combinations

01:18:31.850 --> 01:18:33.760
of those things.
