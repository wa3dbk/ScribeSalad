00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.670
ERIK DEMAINE: Today,
we continue our theme

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:24.217
on integer data structures.

00:00:24.217 --> 00:00:26.300
And we're going to cover
one data structure called

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.070
fusion trees, which introduces
a bunch of cool concepts using,

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.060
you might call bit tricks,
using the word level parallelism

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.329
to do lots of great things.

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:39.620
To do those great things we
need to do something called

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.040
sketching, which is essentially
taking w-bit integers

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.600
and making them
less than w-bits,

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.660
but still having enough
stuff that we care about.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.660
And then we can actually
compute those sketches

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.680
using integer multiplication
in a very clever way.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.520
And given a bunch of
these slightly less than w

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.610
bit numbers we can
compare several

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.700
for the price of one operation
as a parallel comparison.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.930
And then a particularly
nifty thing,

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.120
which is new this time I
haven't covered it before,

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.330
is how to compute
the leftmost 1 bit

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.790
in a w-bit integer in
constant time, all very cool.

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.040
And so we're going to
combine all these techniques

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.000
and get fusion trees.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.040
What do fusion trees
give us in the end?

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.620
Basically, the goal is to get
log base w of n, predecessor

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.050
and successor.

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.040
So we're again talking about
the predecessor problem.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:49.430
We did log of w last time with
van Emde Boas and y-fast tries.

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.430
So then with the two
of them together, we

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.750
get log w and log base w of n.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.400
The min of those
two things is always

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.470
at most root log n, but
sometimes much better

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:04.470
than that.

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.230
So fusion trees are
great when w is big,

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.250
van Emde Boas was good
when w was smallish.

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.510
Like poly log n, van
Emde Boas is optimal.

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:20.120
Here, we're thinking
about w being closer to n,

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.400
or maybe n to the
epsilon or something.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.950
Then we get constant time,
if it's n to the epsilon.

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.765
Anyway, the version we're
going to cover is static.

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:40.850
And it's linear space, and
it runs on the good old word

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.200
RAM, which you may
recall is regular C

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.504
operations on w-bit words.
w is at least log n,

00:02:48.504 --> 00:02:49.670
so you can do random access.

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.070
And anything else?

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.950
I think that's the
version we will cover.

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.230
And that is the original
version of Fredman and Willard,

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.410
and it was invented
in 1990, which

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.060
was one year after the
cold fusion debacle.

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.831
So this may be where
this name came from.

00:03:08.831 --> 00:03:11.330
There's other reasons it might
be called fusion trees, which

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.910
we'll get to.

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:15.024
Cool.

00:03:15.024 --> 00:03:16.940
So now, there's other
versions of fusion trees

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.450
which I will not cover, but
just so you know about them.

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.510
And in some sense we
will pseudo cover them.

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:30.526
There's a version
for an AC0 RAM.

00:03:30.526 --> 00:03:33.150
This is a model we
haven't talked about.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.800
It's another version of
a trans-dichotomous RAM,

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.110
somewhere off to the
side next to word RAM.

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.390
AC0 is a circuit model.

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:50.090
And it's basically any constant
depth circuit of unbounded fan

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.840
in and fan out.

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.920
And so in particular
what AC0 forbids

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.805
are operations like
multiplication.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.769
I think this used to be a
bigger deal than it is today.

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:14.060
I think multiplication used
to be in order of magnitude

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.610
slower than integer addition.

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:18.395
I checked on current
Intel architecture.

00:04:18.395 --> 00:04:20.480
It's about 3 times
slower than an addition,

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.660
because of pipelining a
lot of things get cheaper.

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.080
But in some theoretical
sense, multiplication

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.880
is worse than a lot
of other operations,

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.030
because you need to have
a log and depth circuit.

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.476
So you can't quite get
as much parallelism

00:04:34.476 --> 00:04:35.850
as you can with
integer addition.

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:36.830
If you don't know
about circuit models,

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.080
don't worry about it too much.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.260
But AC0 means no multiplication,
sort of simpler operations.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:43.930
The weird thing
about the AC0 RAM

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:49.010
is it lets you do weird things,
which are AC0, but are not

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.581
in C. So you could look
at the intersection of AC0

00:04:52.581 --> 00:04:54.830
RAM and word RAM, and that
would basically be word RAM

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.780
without multiplication.

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.090
But AC0 RAM allows
other operations

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.876
as long as there's some
circuit that can compute them.

00:05:01.876 --> 00:05:03.500
Sometimes they're
reasonable operations

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.860
like most significant set
bit is an AC0 operation.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.640
So, you don't have to do any
work to get this operation.

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.770
So, in some sense this
makes your life easier.

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.060
In other ways it makes
your life harder,

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:15.620
because there is
no multiplication

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.450
and we're going to
use multiplication

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.660
to compute sketches
and other things.

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.390
So it's both better and worse.

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:27.440
This is by Anderson
and others a few years

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.780
after the original fusion trees.

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:31.880
More interesting
is that there are--

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.690
so this is a version
of fusion trees.

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:38.990
More interesting are the dynamic
versions of fusion trees.

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:47.915
So there's one that
the first version--

00:05:47.915 --> 00:05:49.580
it's actually published later.

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.430
There's a general trick
for dynamizing static data

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:03.930
structures.

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:04.830
We actually saw one.

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.170
You may recall weight balanced
search trees was a way

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:09.870
to dynamize a static
data structure.

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:13.260
It turns out it doesn't work
so great on fusion trees.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:17.820
Because the time to build a
fusion tree is polynomial.

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:19.364
It's not linear.

00:06:19.364 --> 00:06:20.655
And so that's kind of annoying.

00:06:20.655 --> 00:06:22.530
You need polynomial time
to build this thing.

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:26.830
So weight balance is not enough
to slow down the rebuilds.

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:28.830
There's another structure,
which we won't cover,

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:30.770
called exponential search trees.

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:33.130
It has this log log n overhead.

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:37.465
But other than that, it gives
you a nice time dynamization.

00:06:37.465 --> 00:06:38.540
So these are updates.

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:46.370
There's another version
which uses hashing,

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:54.210
and achieves log base w
expected time for updates.

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:57.600
This is by Raman.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:04.350
And so this gives you matching
the fusion tree query bound,

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:06.960
you can do inserts and deletes,
the same amount of time

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.760
if you allow expected.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:13.110
And essentially the idea is to
do sketches more like hashing.

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:15.210
I mean, think of sketching
as just hashing down

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:16.720
to a smaller universe.

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.990
And in expectation
that will work well,

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:21.030
although it's open,
actually, whether you

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:24.870
can achieve this bound
with high probability.

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.800
So it's an interesting
open question.

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:37.269
So that's the various
versions of fusion trees.

00:07:37.269 --> 00:07:39.185
But we're going to just
cover the static ones,

00:07:39.185 --> 00:07:40.830
because they're
interesting enough.

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:45.880
Dynamic ones are not that
much harder than the regular.

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:48.780
So how do we achieve
log base w of n?

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:52.080
Well we've already seen B-trees
which achieve log base b of n.

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:54.060
So presumably it's
the same idea,

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:59.340
and indeed that's what we'll do.

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:07.520
What we want is a B-tree with
branching factor ideally w.

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:10.130
We can't quite achieve w though.

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:13.780
So it's going to be w to
some small constant power.

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:16.710
And 1/5 is the one that
I'll use in this lecture.

00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:21.150
You can improve it or
make it worse, up to you.

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:23.010
But any constant
up here will do.

00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:25.200
Because then log
base w to the 1/5

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:30.590
is going to be five
times log base w of n.

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:34.004
So we have a node.

00:08:34.004 --> 00:08:36.539
So it has branching
factor w to the 1/5.

00:08:40.526 --> 00:08:42.150
Then the height of
the tree, of course,

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:45.750
is theta log base w of n.

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:47.010
So that's all good.

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:49.230
But now what we need to
do is, doing a predecessor

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:53.520
search given a node, we need to
decide in constant time which

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:55.680
branch has our answer.

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:59.580
So normally in a B-tree you
would read in all these keys,

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:02.310
and then compare your
item to all of them,

00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:04.350
and then decide which way to go.

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:06.630
Because in a B-tree we can
read all of these items

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:08.400
in one operation.

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:10.236
Now here, is that possible?

00:09:10.236 --> 00:09:10.860
Think about it.

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:14.640
You've got each of these
keys is w bits long.

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:18.300
There's w to the 1/5 of them.

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:22.890
So the total number
of bits in the node

00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:29.460
to store all those keys is w to
the 1 plus 1/5, which is a lot.

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:32.280
There's no way you can read all
those bits in constant time.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.852
You can only read order
w bits in constant time.

00:09:34.852 --> 00:09:36.060
So we can't look at them all.

00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:39.060
Somehow, we still have to figure
out which way to go correctly

00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:40.450
in constant time.

00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:44.810
So this is the idea
of a fusion node.

00:09:54.310 --> 00:10:03.200
We need to be able to store k,
which is order w to the 1/5.

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:07.200
Keys, I'm going to
give them some names,

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:11.580
x0 up to xk minus 1.

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:13.220
Assume that they've
been presorted.

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:15.500
We can preprocess and
do all those things.

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:20.490
I'm going to go constant time,
predecessor and successor,

00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:23.940
and it's going to
be linear space,

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:27.800
and it's going to require
polynomial preprocessing.

00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:32.031
And this is the annoying part.

00:10:32.031 --> 00:10:33.405
If this was just
k preprocessing,

00:10:33.405 --> 00:10:35.430
it would be easy to make
fusion trees dynamic.

00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:38.610
But it's k to squared,
or k cubed or something,

00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:40.689
depending on how fancy you are.

00:10:40.689 --> 00:10:42.480
It's not known how to
do it in linear time.

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:47.000
So that's really our goal.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.220
If we can implement
fusion tree nodes

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:53.540
and do constant time predecessor
on this small value of n

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:56.361
basically, when n is
only w to the 1/5.

00:10:56.361 --> 00:10:57.860
If we can do constant
time for that,

00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:02.360
then by plugging in B-trees
we get the log base w of n

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:05.540
for arbitrary values of n.

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:08.340
So it's really all
about a single mode

00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:09.620
and doing that fast.

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:18.340
So, the rest of the
lecture will be about that.

00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:21.310
So, I want to introduce
this idea of sketching.

00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:24.340
And to do that
I'm going to think

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:29.740
about what it takes
to distinguish

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:31.360
this small number of keys.

00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:41.770
High level ideas, well
we've got w to the 1/5 keys.

00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:43.750
Each of them is w bits.

00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:47.120
Do you really need all
w bits for each of them?

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:48.430
It seems a little excessive.

00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:51.880
If there's only w to the 1/5,
you should only need about w

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:55.180
to the 1/5 bits of each
to distinguish them all.

00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:56.740
So that's the intuition.

00:11:56.740 --> 00:12:00.160
And indeed, you can
formalize that intuition

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:04.690
by viewing each of the keys
as a path in a binary tree.

00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:17.160
So this represents the
bit string 01011101.

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:18.640
0 means left.

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:20.710
1 means right.

00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:22.510
This is a transformation
we'll use a lot.

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:24.220
So maybe that's in your set.

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:30.260
Maybe this other bit
string is in your set.

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:34.438
Maybe this bit string--

00:12:34.438 --> 00:12:36.437
oh, I've got to make these
the same height which

00:12:36.437 --> 00:12:37.853
is a little challenging.

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:45.250
So maybe those are the three.

00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:48.400
Suppose you just have these
three bit strings, w bit

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:49.300
strings in your set.

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:52.900
So this is a tree of height w.

00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:58.250
Because each of the keys
has w bits, so maybe k is 3.

00:12:58.250 --> 00:12:59.781
And those are your three keys.

00:12:59.781 --> 00:13:00.280
OK.

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:03.730
The idea is, look at
the branching nodes.

00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:06.960
Where's a color?

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:11.860
So, you've got a branching node
here and a branching node here.

00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:14.170
Because there's
three leaves, there's

00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:16.730
only going to be
two branching nodes.

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:21.280
So the idea is, well I really
only care about these two bits.

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:23.620
Or it would be enough to
think about these two bits.

00:13:26.061 --> 00:13:26.560
OK.

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:29.200
Well, we'll look at this
more formally in a moment.

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:32.800
But by storing this bit,
I know whether the key

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:34.957
is over here on the left
or over here on the right.

00:13:34.957 --> 00:13:36.790
And then by storing
this bit, I don't really

00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:38.440
care about it for this word.

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:40.930
But it will distinguish
these two words.

00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:44.380
So if you just look at the bits
that contain branching nodes

00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:51.370
in this tri-view, then it's
enough to distinguish all

00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:53.080
of the xi's.

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:57.670
So this is x0, x1, x2.

00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:01.220
OK.

00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:04.430
Let me formalize
that a little bit.

00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:16.280
So we have k minus 1 branching
nodes in this height w

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:27.135
tree of the k keys.

00:14:27.135 --> 00:14:28.510
Because there's
k leaves, there's

00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:32.600
going to be k minus 1 branching
nodes, because the k leaves are

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:34.310
distinct.

00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:41.882
So this means there are at most,
k minus 1 levels containing

00:14:41.882 --> 00:14:42.590
a branching node.

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:43.340
It might be fewer.

00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:56.080
Maybe it's nice to add
in another key over here

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:57.030
on the left.

00:14:57.030 --> 00:14:59.800
I mean if I was lucky, there'd
be another key over here,

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:01.720
and then I'd be using
this bit and getting two

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:03.100
for the price of one.

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:06.731
If I'm less lucky, it
will be more like this.

00:15:06.731 --> 00:15:11.230
So here's another x value.

00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:13.720
And in this case, I care
about this branching node.

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:17.380
So I care about
another bit here.

00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:17.880
OK.

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:22.390
But if I have four keys, it
will be at most three bits

00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:24.680
corresponding to these levels.

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:27.640
So call these-- these
levels correspond to bits.

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:30.880
This is the first bit, second
bit, third bit, and so on.

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:33.180
This is the most
significant bit, next,

00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:37.310
and then the least
significant is at the bottom.

00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:46.720
So these levels correspond
to important bits.

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:47.650
That's the definition.

00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:55.500
And we're going to give
these bits a name, b0, b1,

00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:57.700
up to br minus 1.

00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:02.320
Those are bit indices saying
which bits we care about.

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:09.040
And we know that r is less than
k, and k is order w to the 1/5.

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:13.560
So there are only w to
the 1/5 important bits

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:17.050
overall among these k keys.

00:16:17.050 --> 00:16:20.170
So the idea is don't store
all w bits for all the keys.

00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:21.590
I mean you have to store them.

00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:22.780
But don't look at them.

00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:26.680
Just look at these
important bits for the keys.

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:28.180
And then life is good.

00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:31.720
Because there's only w
to the 1/5 bits per key.

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:34.250
There's only w to the 1/5 keys.

00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:45.280
And so the total number of
important bits among all k keys

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:46.310
is small.

00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:49.810
It's only w to the 2/5,
which is less than w.

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:51.520
So it fits in a single
word, and we can

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:52.840
look at this in constant time.

00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:57.100
So that seems like a good thing.

00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:05.050
Let me tell you what
properties this has.

00:17:05.050 --> 00:17:14.910
Let me also define the notion
of a perfect sketch of a word.

00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:22.750
x is going to be what
you get when you extract

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:30.130
bits b0 to br minus 1 from x.

00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:40.760
So in other words, this is a bit
string, an r-bit string who's

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:49.810
i-th bit equals bit bi of x.

00:17:49.810 --> 00:17:52.570
So you've got a bit
string which is x.

00:17:52.570 --> 00:17:55.910
You say, oh, the important
ones are this one, this one,

00:17:55.910 --> 00:17:57.390
this one, and this one.

00:17:57.390 --> 00:18:00.730
Inside here is
either a 0 or a 1.

00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:02.811
And there's other bits
which we don't care about,

00:18:02.811 --> 00:18:04.060
because they're not important.

00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:10.750
And we just compress
this to a 4-bit string.

00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:16.280
0110.

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:16.780
OK.

00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:18.275
This is sketch of x.

00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:24.250
And to be a little bit
more explicit about how I'm

00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:26.920
labeling things, this is b0.

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:30.730
This is b1, b2, and b3.

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:36.100
Because you number bits--

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:38.854
I think this is right,
we'll see later--

00:18:38.854 --> 00:18:41.020
we're going to number bits
from the right-hand side.

00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:45.090
This is 0-th bit, first
bit, second, third, fourth;

00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:48.450
which is the opposite of this
picture, unfortunately, sorry.

00:18:48.450 --> 00:18:51.670
This is a bit 0, bit 1, anyway.

00:18:51.670 --> 00:18:52.805
This will be convenient.

00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:03.414
So, that's perfect sketch.

00:19:03.414 --> 00:19:05.080
For now, I'm going
to assume that we can

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:07.150
compute this in constant time.

00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:12.715
This one answer is
it's an AC0 operation.

00:19:12.715 --> 00:19:15.200
That's not so obvious,
but it's true.

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:17.861
So on an AC0 RAM, you can just
say, oh, this is an operation.

00:19:17.861 --> 00:19:18.360
Right?

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:20.030
It's given one word.

00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:21.440
And, well OK.

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:23.810
It's given these
description of bit numbers,

00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:25.700
but those will also
fit in one word.

00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:29.256
And then does this
bit extraction.

00:19:29.256 --> 00:19:31.130
We're going to see a
reasonable way to do it.

00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:33.504
But for now, take that as an
unreasonable way to do this.

00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:47.365
So perfect sketch is
good, because it implies

00:19:47.365 --> 00:19:49.470
the following nice property.

00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:52.380
If you look at the
sketch of x0 that's

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:58.320
going to be less than the
sketch of x1, and so on,

00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:07.438
which is going to be less
than the sketch of xk minus 1.

00:20:07.438 --> 00:20:09.480
Sketch preserves order.

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:12.630
We assume that--
where do we have it?

00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:18.150
Over here, x0 is less than
x1, is less than xk minus 1.

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:22.260
And because we're
keeping all the bits

00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:24.660
where are these xi's
get distinguished,

00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:26.970
this one it doesn't matter
whether we kept here,

00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:28.290
it doesn't matter whether
we kept these guys.

00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:30.000
But in particular,
we keep the bits that

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.560
have all the branching nodes.

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:34.170
That will preserve
the order of the xi's.

00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:36.270
So we know that the
order of the xi's is

00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:37.890
preserved under sketching.

00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:40.700
The trouble is the following.

00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:47.240
Suppose you want to do a
search, a predecessor search.

00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:53.550
So, you're given some query q,
and you want to know where does

00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:55.380
q fit among the xi's.

00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:59.880
Because that will tell you
which child to visit from here.

00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:00.510
So, OK.

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:06.540
You compute a sketch
of q, seems reasonable,

00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:08.910
and move into sketch world.

00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:12.030
And now you try to
find where sketch of q

00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:13.729
fits among these guys.

00:21:13.729 --> 00:21:14.520
So you can do that.

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:16.490
And I claim you can do
that in constant time.

00:21:16.490 --> 00:21:18.690
It's again, an AC0 operation.

00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:22.170
But the nice thing is the
sketches all fit in one word.

00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:25.890
Also this single sketch fits
in one word, no big surprise

00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:27.850
there.

00:21:27.850 --> 00:21:29.790
So let's say you can
find where sketch of q

00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:32.100
fits among these items
in constant time.

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:35.970
The trouble is were the sketch
of q fits is not necessarily

00:21:35.970 --> 00:21:40.860
the same as where q
fits among the xi's.

00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:44.520
Because q was not involved
in the definition of sketch.

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:45.730
q is an arbitrary query.

00:21:45.730 --> 00:21:49.950
They come online, I mean
any word could be a query,

00:21:49.950 --> 00:21:51.180
not just the xi's.

00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:54.420
So you've set everything up
to distinguish all the xi's.

00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:58.920
But q is going to fall off
this tree at some point.

00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:01.200
And that kind of messes you up.

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:04.140
Because if q fell off here,
you don't have that bit.

00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:07.740
You won't notice
the q fit there.

00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:10.050
So we have to do some work.

00:22:10.050 --> 00:22:14.060
And this is what I
call de-sketchifying.

00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:20.790
And I like a big board.

00:22:45.541 --> 00:22:51.245
OK, let mean draw a some more
methodical and smaller example.

00:22:55.376 --> 00:22:57.660
I need to make it the
right number of levels.

00:23:23.789 --> 00:23:34.110
A little bigger than my usual
tree, and I'll get my red,

00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:35.895
actually maybe use two colors.

00:23:59.370 --> 00:24:02.750
So here's a real example.

00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:05.210
Now it has four keys.

00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:08.830
And here I'm in the lucky case,
where this is an important bit.

00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:14.090
And I get two for
the price of one.

00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:15.860
I cared about this
branching node,

00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:18.770
I cared about this
branching node,

00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:21.710
and so I only have to
door two bits in my sketch

00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:24.050
for these four nodes.

00:24:24.050 --> 00:24:25.580
In general, it
might be three bits.

00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:27.070
But this will just
make the point.

00:24:27.070 --> 00:24:29.660
So it's actually,
life is in some ways

00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:31.590
harder in this situation.

00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:32.090
OK.

00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:33.423
So what are my bit strings here?

00:24:33.423 --> 00:24:38.461
Over here I've got 0000, which
corresponds to always going

00:24:38.461 --> 00:24:38.960
left.

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:44.360
And I've got 0010.

00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:52.530
Over here I've
got 1100 and 1111.

00:24:52.530 --> 00:24:54.725
We drew these pictures
for van Emde Boas, right?

00:24:54.725 --> 00:24:57.680
The idea is we're
going to use some

00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:00.550
of the similar
perspectives at least.

00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:03.770
OK, but the important bits were
the very first, the leftmost

00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:05.150
bit I should say.

00:25:05.150 --> 00:25:12.810
And then two bits after
that, so these guys.

00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:25.197
And so the sketch here
is 11, 10, 01, and 00.

00:25:25.197 --> 00:25:27.280
And you can see this is
the minimal number of bits

00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:29.300
I need to keep them in order.

00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:29.860
But it does.

00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:30.717
It works.

00:25:30.717 --> 00:25:31.300
You can check.

00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:34.430
This works in general.

00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:34.930
OK.

00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:36.250
Now comes the query.

00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:40.420
I have a problematic
query I'd like to draw.

00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:45.760
And it is 0101, so 0-1-0-1.

00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:48.444
So here's my query queue.

00:25:48.444 --> 00:25:50.760
Let me draw these as white.

00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:57.120
Query is 0101.

00:25:57.120 --> 00:26:04.350
1 If we take the
sketch, we get 00.

00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:07.060
Those are the important bits.

00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:11.040
So if I search for
the query of 00,

00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:13.530
I will find that it
happens to match this key,

00:26:13.530 --> 00:26:16.220
or it matches the
sketch of this key.

00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:19.740
But that key is neither the
predecessor, nor the successor

00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:20.880
of that query.

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:22.140
So this is bad news.

00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:25.500
I find the predecessor in sketch
world, which is the red stuff,

00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:26.660
I get the wrong answer.

00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:29.910
In general, they could be
very far away from each other.

00:26:29.910 --> 00:26:32.815
Here, I've got it 1
away, but that's as big

00:26:32.815 --> 00:26:34.040
an example as I can draw.

00:26:37.162 --> 00:26:39.040
So, how do we deal with this?

00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:55.590
This is the de-sketchification.

00:26:55.590 --> 00:27:01.180
So when I do this query, I
end up finding this guy, x0.

00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:07.080
I claim that I can still use
that for something interesting.

00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:15.510
OK, let's say we
have a sketch of xi

00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:21.240
as the predecessor
of the sketch of q.

00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:23.640
And so sketch of q is
sandwiched between a sketch

00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:26.952
of xi and sketch of xi plus 1.

00:27:26.952 --> 00:27:28.410
First of all, we're
assuming that I

00:27:28.410 --> 00:27:30.000
can compute this
in constant time,

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.160
I can find where sketch of
q fits among these guys.

00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:34.245
Because it just fits into words.

00:27:34.245 --> 00:27:36.120
And for now, let's just
assume all operations

00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:37.710
on a constant number of
words are at constant time.

00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:38.880
We will see how to do this.

00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:41.150
This is parallel comparison.

00:27:41.150 --> 00:27:44.700
So you figure out
sketch of q fits here.

00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:48.300
I want to learn something about
where q fits among the xi's.

00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:51.130
It's obviously, these
may be the wrong answer.

00:27:51.130 --> 00:27:54.720
But I claim I can do
something useful by looking

00:27:54.720 --> 00:28:00.030
at the longest common
prefix of those words.

00:28:08.130 --> 00:28:12.990
So I want to compare q, not
sketch of q but the real value

00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:23.340
q, and either xi or xi plus 1.

00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:25.570
And what I want is the longest.

00:28:25.570 --> 00:28:28.890
So I look at the longest
common prefix of q and xi.

00:28:28.890 --> 00:28:32.040
I look at longest common
prefix of q and xi plus 1.

00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:34.950
Whichever of those
is the longest that's

00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:36.150
my longest common prefix.

00:28:36.150 --> 00:28:39.150
In the tree, it's the
longest common ancestor,

00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:41.090
or lowest common ancestor.

00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:44.160
OK.

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:46.680
So let's do it.

00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:49.440
We found that sketch of
q fit between, I guess,

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:51.600
these two guys, the
way I've written it

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:52.560
with the inequalities.

00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:56.190
It's between x0 here and x1.

00:28:56.190 --> 00:29:00.750
So in this case, the
lowest common ancestor

00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:03.810
of this node and q
is going to be here.

00:29:03.810 --> 00:29:06.420
Also this node and q
happens to also be here.

00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:09.900
So this is the lowest we can go.

00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:14.810
And what this means
is that these guys,

00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:16.950
they share the bit
string up to here.

00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:20.130
We were on the blue
substructure up till here.

00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:22.890
This was the node
where q diverged.

00:29:22.890 --> 00:29:26.880
We followed a pointer here
along a non-blue edge.

00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:28.180
That's where we made a mistake.

00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:30.330
So this lets us
find, in some sense,

00:29:30.330 --> 00:29:33.360
the first mistake, where
we fell off the tree.

00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:35.610
So that's where we
fell off the blue tree.

00:29:35.610 --> 00:29:38.040
That's useful information.

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:41.640
Because now we know, well,
we went to the right,

00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:44.880
whereas all the actual data is
over here in the left subtree.

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:47.730
There is no blue
stuff in the right.

00:29:47.730 --> 00:29:48.810
So that tells us a lot.

00:29:48.810 --> 00:29:51.530
If we want to now find
the predecessor of q,

00:29:51.530 --> 00:29:55.630
it's going to be whatever
is the max in this subtree.

00:29:55.630 --> 00:29:59.080
So, I just need to be able
to find the max over here.

00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:00.420
So this is the idea.

00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:03.300
Now there's two cases, depending
on whether we were in the right

00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:05.220
or in the left from that node.

00:30:10.650 --> 00:30:18.090
So let me write
this, find the node y

00:30:18.090 --> 00:30:25.680
where q fell off the blue tree.

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:29.070
So this node y, we can
think of as a bit number.

00:30:29.070 --> 00:30:31.820
Here the leftmost
bit was still on,

00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:34.500
but then the next bit was off.

00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:36.180
And so we look at--

00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:42.180
I'll call that bit y plus 1,
or maybe size of y plus 1.

00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:49.760
If that bit equals 1,
that's the picture we have.

00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:56.190
Then what I'm going to do
is set a new quantity e,

00:30:56.190 --> 00:30:57.190
which is going to be--

00:30:57.190 --> 00:30:58.560
this is a new word.

00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:02.280
It's going to be the bit
string y, followed by a 0,

00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:03.620
followed by lots of 1's.

00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:14.696
Whereas our bit string q had a
1 here, and fell off the tree.

00:31:14.696 --> 00:31:16.070
What we're instead
going to do is

00:31:16.070 --> 00:31:22.190
identify this node, the
rightmost node in this subtree.

00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:24.680
That's not necessarily an xi.

00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:26.330
But it's a thing.

00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:28.460
And then we're
going to do, again,

00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:35.630
this search and sketch space,
but now using e instead of q.

00:31:35.630 --> 00:31:38.720
If we do that,
what is this node?

00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:42.440
Let's label it, 0011.

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:47.069
If you look at the sketch
bits, this has a sketch of 01.

00:31:47.069 --> 00:31:48.860
So if I did a search
here, I would actually

00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:51.770
find that this is
the answer, and that

00:31:51.770 --> 00:31:53.900
actually is a predecessor of q.

00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:56.270
In general, this is
going to work well.

00:31:56.270 --> 00:32:00.684
Because essentially
some of these bits

00:32:00.684 --> 00:32:01.850
are going to be sketch bits.

00:32:01.850 --> 00:32:05.150
This one was not, and
we made a mistake there.

00:32:05.150 --> 00:32:05.940
We went right.

00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:07.022
We should have got left.

00:32:07.022 --> 00:32:09.230
These ones, some of them
are going to be sketch bits.

00:32:09.230 --> 00:32:10.460
Some of them are not.

00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:12.260
But whichever ones
get underlined,

00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:15.050
it's going to be a
1, which means we're

00:32:15.050 --> 00:32:16.760
going to do the right thing.

00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:20.370
We want the very rightmost
item in this tree.

00:32:20.370 --> 00:32:24.050
So if we always go right
whenever there's a sketch bit,

00:32:24.050 --> 00:32:26.570
and then do a search
in sketch space,

00:32:26.570 --> 00:32:30.240
we will find the rightmost
item in this tree.

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:32.480
So if we then do a
search on e, we're

00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:35.100
always going to get
the right answer.

00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:38.090
So in the end, we're going do
two searches in sketch space,

00:32:38.090 --> 00:32:41.930
once with q to find this
place where we fell off,

00:32:41.930 --> 00:32:47.720
then once with e where we
actually find the right answer.

00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:54.560
And there's a symmetric case,
which is if we went left and we

00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:56.930
should have gone right,
then we go right,

00:32:56.930 --> 00:32:58.190
and then we put a lot of 0's.

00:32:58.190 --> 00:33:00.420
Because then we want to
find the min in that tree.

00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:14.120
So, back to search, we
compute sketch of q.

00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:19.785
We find it among the
sketch of the xi's.

00:33:24.050 --> 00:33:27.120
This gives us this y.

00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:31.690
So we find the
longest common prefix,

00:33:31.690 --> 00:33:41.240
y equals longest common prefix
of q and xi or xi plus 1.

00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:55.346
Then we compute e, and then we
find sketch of e among sketch

00:33:55.346 --> 00:33:55.845
of xi's.

00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:05.700
And the claim is that the
predecessor and successor

00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:13.250
of sketch of e among sketch
of xi's equals the predecessor

00:34:13.250 --> 00:34:26.010
and successor of q, our
actual query, among the xi's.

00:34:38.669 --> 00:34:39.460
So this is a claim.

00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:40.340
It needs proof.

00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:43.790
But it's what I've been
arguing that e gives us

00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:44.780
the right structure.

00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:47.840
It fixes all the sketch bits
that are potentially wrong.

00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:50.480
We found the first sketch
bit that was wrong.

00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:51.763
We fixed that one.

00:34:51.763 --> 00:34:53.929
And then the remainder, as
long as we go all the way

00:34:53.929 --> 00:34:58.070
to the right, we'll find the
max, or in the other case

00:34:58.070 --> 00:34:59.840
we want to go all
the way to the left

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:01.970
because we want to find the min.

00:35:01.970 --> 00:35:04.060
So that's this claim.

00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:06.340
We find the predecessor
of sketch of e.

00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:10.530
Run the sketch of the xi's,
which is just this thing again.

00:35:10.530 --> 00:35:12.650
So again, we can do
it in constant time.

00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:14.390
Then we find--

00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:16.939
I mean I have to be a little
bit more precise here.

00:35:16.939 --> 00:35:18.980
Of course, we find the
predecessor and successor,

00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:20.090
we get a sketch of the xi.

00:35:20.090 --> 00:35:22.160
We have to undo that
sketch operation.

00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:24.830
Really the way to think of it
is predecessor and successor

00:35:24.830 --> 00:35:27.530
are really returning a rank.

00:35:27.530 --> 00:35:29.510
I want to know the
i that matters.

00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:36.155
So if it fits between sketch
of xi and sketch of xi plus 1,

00:35:36.155 --> 00:35:38.180
if sketch of e
fits between those,

00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:43.730
then I know that q will fit
between xi and xi plus 1,

00:35:43.730 --> 00:35:48.290
in terms of that rank, i,
the index in the array.

00:35:51.134 --> 00:35:53.170
So, that makes sense.

00:35:53.170 --> 00:35:59.970
This is the end of the--

00:35:59.970 --> 00:36:01.410
what's the right way to put it?

00:36:01.410 --> 00:36:04.330
This is the big picture
of fusion trees.

00:36:04.330 --> 00:36:09.070
At this point you should
believe that everything works.

00:36:09.070 --> 00:36:10.590
And overall, what are we doing?

00:36:10.590 --> 00:36:13.200
We're building a
w to the 1/5 tree.

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:16.587
It's not yet clear
why w to the 1/5.

00:36:16.587 --> 00:36:18.420
And so we have to
implement these nodes that

00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:20.114
only have w to the 1/5 keys.

00:36:20.114 --> 00:36:21.530
So we're looking
at a single node.

00:36:21.530 --> 00:36:23.610
And say, hey look,
there's a bunch of keys.

00:36:23.610 --> 00:36:25.380
Let's just look at
the important bits.

00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:27.630
That defines the
sketch operation.

00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:31.170
Now if we want to do a search,
we do this double search.

00:36:31.170 --> 00:36:35.370
We compute the sketch, find
the sketch among the sketches,

00:36:35.370 --> 00:36:39.270
find our mistake,
compute our proper query,

00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:42.690
compute the sketch of that, find
that sketch among the sketches,

00:36:42.690 --> 00:36:46.620
and then that index in the array
of sketches will be the correct

00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:51.910
index of our actual
query q among the xi's.

00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:53.370
Now, there are
several things left

00:36:53.370 --> 00:36:55.200
to be done in a reasonable way.

00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:58.530
One is how do we
compute sketches.

00:36:58.530 --> 00:37:00.210
How do we do this
kind of operation

00:37:00.210 --> 00:37:03.210
of taking the bits we care
about and bringing them

00:37:03.210 --> 00:37:06.220
all next to each other?

00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:08.250
Second thing is, how
do we do this find?

00:37:08.250 --> 00:37:10.260
This parallel comparison.

00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:12.990
So it's basically all
the bullets up here.

00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:15.960
We have how do we
do a sketch, how

00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:19.020
do we do parallel comparison
to find where one sketch fits

00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:22.720
among many sketches, and there's
also a most significant set

00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:23.220
bit.

00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:24.900
Where did we do that?

00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:28.267
In computing the
longest common prefix.

00:37:28.267 --> 00:37:29.850
So if you have two
bit strings and you

00:37:29.850 --> 00:37:32.779
want to know where
did they first differ,

00:37:32.779 --> 00:37:34.320
the natural way to
do that is compute

00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:37.170
the XOR, which gives you
all the differing bits.

00:37:37.170 --> 00:37:40.230
And then find the first
one bit from the left.

00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:43.650
So this is really most
significant set bit.

00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:50.010
So, we need that operation.

00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:56.610
So, we have our
work cut out for us.

00:37:56.610 --> 00:37:58.580
But the overall
picture of fusion trees

00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:00.740
should now be clear.

00:38:00.740 --> 00:38:03.090
It just remains to do
these three things.

00:38:03.090 --> 00:38:06.090
And this is where the
engineering comes in,

00:38:06.090 --> 00:38:09.010
I would say.

00:38:09.010 --> 00:38:11.620
Any questions about
the big picture?

00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:34.840
So, the first thing I'm
going to do is sketch.

00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:37.115
And as I've hinted at
in the outline here,

00:38:37.115 --> 00:38:38.740
we're not going to
do a perfect sketch.

00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:40.406
We're going to do an
approximate sketch.

00:38:43.810 --> 00:38:45.790
This will probably
be the most work

00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:47.059
among any of these operations.

00:38:47.059 --> 00:38:48.850
Parallel comparison is
actually quite easy.

00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:54.100
Sketching is, I think,
the biggest insight

00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:57.340
in Fusion trees.

00:38:57.340 --> 00:39:01.450
So, perfect sketch
takes just the bits

00:39:01.450 --> 00:39:03.092
you care about that we need.

00:39:03.092 --> 00:39:05.050
We only want to look at
the bits we care about.

00:39:05.050 --> 00:39:07.049
But it's easy to look at
the bits we care about.

00:39:07.049 --> 00:39:10.090
We can apply a mask, and just
AND out the bits we care about.

00:39:10.090 --> 00:39:12.040
Everything else we can zero out.

00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:12.670
So that's easy.

00:39:12.670 --> 00:39:16.480
The hard part is compression,
taking these four bits

00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:18.950
and making them four
consecutive bits.

00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:21.370
But they don't really
need to be consecutive.

00:39:21.370 --> 00:39:28.810
If I added in some 0's here
in a consistent pattern

00:39:28.810 --> 00:39:29.770
that would still work.

00:39:29.770 --> 00:39:31.769
I'd still preserve the
order among the sketches.

00:39:31.769 --> 00:39:33.225
And that's all I care about.

00:39:33.225 --> 00:39:35.350
And this is where I'm going
to use the slop I have.

00:39:35.350 --> 00:39:39.260
Because right now I
have w to the 1/5 keys.

00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:41.410
If I did perfect sketch,
the total number of bits

00:39:41.410 --> 00:39:42.970
would only be w to the 2/5.

00:39:42.970 --> 00:39:45.010
But I can go up to w.

00:39:45.010 --> 00:39:51.010
So what I'm going
to do is basically

00:39:51.010 --> 00:40:02.170
spread out the bits,
the important bits,

00:40:02.170 --> 00:40:15.480
in a predictable pattern
of length w to the 4/5.

00:40:19.690 --> 00:40:22.450
Predictable just means it
doesn't depend on what x is.

00:40:22.450 --> 00:40:28.120
So when there are extra 0's
here, you know that's fine.

00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:31.220
But there's always going to
be two 0's here, one 0 here,

00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:34.300
three 0's here, no
matter what x was.

00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:37.100
As long as it's predictable,
I'm going to preserve order.

00:40:37.100 --> 00:40:39.960
And as long as it's
length order w to the 4/5,

00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:42.176
if I take w to the
1/5 of them, that

00:40:42.176 --> 00:40:44.050
will still fit in a
constant number of words.

00:40:44.050 --> 00:40:47.390
Because it will be
order w bits total.

00:40:47.390 --> 00:40:49.020
So that's what I can afford.

00:40:49.020 --> 00:40:52.480
And now I'm going to do it.

00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:55.887
So here's how.

00:40:55.887 --> 00:40:57.470
First thing, as I
said, is we're going

00:40:57.470 --> 00:40:59.680
to mask the important bits.

00:41:04.509 --> 00:41:05.800
I just want the important bits.

00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:07.660
I should throw away
all the others.

00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:16.075
And so this is going to be x
prime equals x bit-wise AND.

00:41:25.171 --> 00:41:27.670
And here's where I'm going to
use the notation that the bits

00:41:27.670 --> 00:41:29.080
count from the right.

00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:32.920
I want the bi-th bit to
correspond to the value 2

00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:34.510
to the bi.

00:41:34.510 --> 00:41:37.730
This thing is just a bit string.

00:41:37.730 --> 00:41:41.920
It has 1's wherever
the important bits are.

00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:49.180
So if this is the
b0, b1, b2, and b3;

00:41:49.180 --> 00:41:52.000
I just want this bit string.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:55.360
I mean, you can think of this
as 1 shifted left bi times.

00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:57.950
So I get 1's in exactly
the positions I care about.

00:41:57.950 --> 00:42:00.010
And if I bit-wise AND
that with x it zeros out

00:42:00.010 --> 00:42:01.130
all the other bits.

00:42:01.130 --> 00:42:02.350
This is what we call masking.

00:42:05.950 --> 00:42:08.480
So that's the
obvious thing to do.

00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:14.100
And then the second
idea is multiplication.

00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:17.190
And it's just like, well, maybe
we could do it with a multiply,

00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:19.060
and then we'll just work it out.

00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:21.290
And the answer is yes, you
can do it with a multiply.

00:42:21.290 --> 00:42:24.480
So that I imagine
was the big insight

00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:29.520
was to see that multiplication
is a very powerful operation.

00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:32.975
So we're just going to do x
prime times some number m.

00:42:32.975 --> 00:42:35.100
And we're going to prove
that there exists a number

00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:37.660
m that does what we need.

00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:41.200
So I'm going to write this out
a little bit algebraically.

00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:44.890
So we can think about
what m might be.

00:42:44.890 --> 00:42:48.280
Now x prime only has
the important bits.

00:42:48.280 --> 00:43:00.620
So we can write that as a sum i
equals 0 to r minus 1 of xbi 2

00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:02.010
to the bi.

00:43:02.010 --> 00:43:04.500
So I am introducing
some notation here. xbi,

00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:08.840
is that important bit bi 1 or 0?

00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:15.090
This is just a de-reference of
the bit vector or a bit string.

00:43:15.090 --> 00:43:17.240
And so you multiply
that by that position.

00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:20.691
I mean this the definition
of binary notation, right?

00:43:20.691 --> 00:43:22.440
But we only care about
the important bits.

00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:23.910
Because only those are set.

00:43:23.910 --> 00:43:25.410
So that's x prime.

00:43:25.410 --> 00:43:28.440
And then we're
multiplying that by m.

00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:31.110
Now m could have any bit set.

00:43:31.110 --> 00:43:33.765
So I'm going to--

00:43:33.765 --> 00:43:35.265
but I'm going to
write it like this.

00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:58.670
I'm going to assume that
m only has r bits set,

00:43:58.670 --> 00:44:01.950
same as the number
of important bits,

00:44:01.950 --> 00:44:03.380
r is a number of important bits.

00:44:10.407 --> 00:44:11.740
But I don't know where they are.

00:44:11.740 --> 00:44:14.850
So I'm just going to suppose
they're at positions m0, m1,

00:44:14.850 --> 00:44:16.440
up to mr minus 1.

00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:20.730
I've got to find what these
mi's should be, or mj's.

00:44:20.730 --> 00:44:22.830
And now just taking
this product,

00:44:22.830 --> 00:44:25.980
so we can expand out the
product algebraically

00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:26.970
and see what we get.

00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:51.930
So, what's this product?

00:44:51.930 --> 00:44:56.200
Sum i equals 0 to
r minus 1 sum j

00:44:56.200 --> 00:45:00.770
equals 0 to r minus 1 of xbi--

00:45:04.452 --> 00:45:06.210
I mean just the
product of these.

00:45:06.210 --> 00:45:10.320
So 2 to the bi plus mj.

00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:12.480
That's the algebraic
product of those two things.

00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:13.938
That's why I wrote
it out this way.

00:45:13.938 --> 00:45:15.270
So I can see what's going on.

00:45:15.270 --> 00:45:17.070
The point is when you
do multiplication,

00:45:17.070 --> 00:45:21.140
you're doing these
pairwise products.

00:45:21.140 --> 00:45:22.770
Now the guys that
are going to survive

00:45:22.770 --> 00:45:25.890
are the ones where the
xbi's are 1, of course.

00:45:25.890 --> 00:45:28.590
But they survive
in multiple places.

00:45:28.590 --> 00:45:33.090
Essentially the mj's
shift all of those bits

00:45:33.090 --> 00:45:35.610
by various amounts.

00:45:35.610 --> 00:45:39.510
So it used to be at this
position, 2 to the bi.

00:45:39.510 --> 00:45:43.140
But now we're shifting
it by mj for all j.

00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:45.960
So some of those bits
might hit each other.

00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:46.770
Then they add up.

00:45:46.770 --> 00:45:48.150
That's really messy.

00:45:48.150 --> 00:45:49.830
We're going to avoid
that, and design

00:45:49.830 --> 00:45:53.750
the mj's so that all of
these values are unique.

00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:56.250
Therefore, bits
never hit each other.

00:45:56.250 --> 00:45:57.990
That's step one.

00:45:57.990 --> 00:46:02.130
And then furthermore, what we
care about or what we're trying

00:46:02.130 --> 00:46:08.160
to do is to get the xbi's to
appear in a nice little window,

00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:14.280
consecutive interval
of w to the 4/5 bits,

00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:15.780
somehow by setting the mj's.

00:46:15.780 --> 00:46:17.995
So let me tell you
the claim, which

00:46:17.995 --> 00:46:20.944
we will prove by induction.

00:46:25.790 --> 00:46:28.042
So we're given these bi's
that we can't control.

00:46:28.042 --> 00:46:29.250
Those are the important bits.

00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:44.790
And the claim is we can
choose the mi's such

00:46:44.790 --> 00:46:47.070
that three properties hold.

00:46:47.070 --> 00:46:59.790
First one is that bi plus mj
are distinct for all i and j.

00:46:59.790 --> 00:47:02.700
So that was that these bits
don't collide with each other.

00:47:02.700 --> 00:47:04.200
So there's no actual
summation here.

00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:05.730
These sums could
then be replaced

00:47:05.730 --> 00:47:08.564
by ORs, which makes
it very easy to keep

00:47:08.564 --> 00:47:10.230
track of where the
bits are going, if we

00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:12.540
can achieve this property.

00:47:12.540 --> 00:47:30.670
Property b is that it
turns out that the bits

00:47:30.670 --> 00:47:32.860
I'm going to end up
caring about our b0

00:47:32.860 --> 00:47:37.360
plus m0, b1 plus m1,
and general bi plus mi.

00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:40.330
In general, we have bi plus
mj for different values

00:47:40.330 --> 00:47:41.530
of i and j.

00:47:41.530 --> 00:47:43.540
I claim the ones I care
about are the ones where

00:47:43.540 --> 00:47:44.662
i and j are equal.

00:47:44.662 --> 00:47:46.120
So I'm going to
look at these bits,

00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:50.860
and in particular I want
them to appear in order

00:47:50.860 --> 00:47:51.976
in the bit string.

00:47:54.730 --> 00:47:57.376
And then third property--

00:47:57.376 --> 00:47:58.765
I need some more space--

00:48:01.570 --> 00:48:05.110
is that if I look at
the span of those bits,

00:48:05.110 --> 00:48:10.150
so I look at br minus
1 plus mr minus 1

00:48:10.150 --> 00:48:17.680
minus b0 plus m0 that is the
interval that these bits span.

00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:23.380
I want that to be order
r to the fourth power.

00:48:23.380 --> 00:48:27.130
Because r was w to the 1/5.

00:48:27.130 --> 00:48:29.710
So this would be
order w to the 4/5.

00:48:29.710 --> 00:48:32.121
That's what I need for
everything to fit in.

00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:37.810
So this is guaranteeing
that these bits

00:48:37.810 --> 00:48:41.510
are the sketch that I need.

00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:44.800
They appear in
order, and they don't

00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:48.092
span a very large interval,
just w to the 4/5.

00:48:48.092 --> 00:48:49.300
This is what I need to prove.

00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:53.695
If I can prove this, I
have approximate sketching.

00:48:53.695 --> 00:48:54.730
So let's prove it.

00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:21.510
Proof happens in two steps.

00:49:21.510 --> 00:49:23.010
First thing I'm
going to worry about

00:49:23.010 --> 00:49:25.890
is just getting
these guys distinct.

00:49:25.890 --> 00:49:28.840
Then I'll worry about
the order property.

00:49:28.840 --> 00:49:31.890
So here's how we
get them distinct.

00:49:31.890 --> 00:49:37.530
And these are going
to be the mi primes,

00:49:37.530 --> 00:49:39.010
not quite the mi's that we want.

00:49:42.450 --> 00:49:47.210
They're all going to be integers
less than r cubed, greater than

00:49:47.210 --> 00:49:51.810
or equal to 0, and they're
going to have the property

00:49:51.810 --> 00:50:06.030
that the bi's plus mj primes
are distinct mod r cubed.

00:50:06.030 --> 00:50:07.740
So this is a stronger
version of a.

00:50:07.740 --> 00:50:09.990
We really just need
them to be distinct.

00:50:09.990 --> 00:50:12.060
But to make it easier
for the other steps,

00:50:12.060 --> 00:50:15.298
we're going to force them
to be distinct mod r cubed.

00:50:18.390 --> 00:50:20.400
How do we do this?

00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:22.000
By induction.

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:31.716
So let's suppose that we've
picked m0 up to mt minus 1.

00:50:31.716 --> 00:50:35.650
So suppose by induction
that we've done that.

00:50:35.650 --> 00:50:38.640
And now our goal is
to pick mt prime.

00:50:41.970 --> 00:50:46.330
So how do we choose mt prime?

00:50:46.330 --> 00:50:49.970
Well, what can't it be?

00:50:49.970 --> 00:50:58.070
mt prime has to avoid
basically mi prime,

00:50:58.070 --> 00:51:03.611
and believe minus bj plus b--

00:51:03.611 --> 00:51:05.050
we're going to call it k?

00:51:05.050 --> 00:51:05.690
I guess so.

00:51:08.990 --> 00:51:12.550
If it avoids all
expressions like this,

00:51:12.550 --> 00:51:19.600
then mt prime plus bj
will be different from mi

00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:21.170
prime plus bk.

00:51:21.170 --> 00:51:23.980
In other words, all of these
things will be distinct.

00:51:23.980 --> 00:51:29.560
So it has to avoid
this modulo r cubed.

00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:31.910
If I can avoid all
of these things--

00:51:31.910 --> 00:51:34.300
so this is for all ijk--

00:51:38.010 --> 00:51:40.600
if I can choose mt prime
to avoid all those,

00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:43.260
then I'm happy.

00:51:43.260 --> 00:51:45.690
Because then these things
will continue to be distinct,

00:51:45.690 --> 00:51:47.700
and then I apply induction.

00:51:47.700 --> 00:51:50.320
Well, how many choices
are there for i, j, and k?

00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:55.116
For i, there's I
guess t choices.

00:51:55.116 --> 00:51:58.950
Because mi can be any
of the previous values.

00:51:58.950 --> 00:52:06.970
For j, let's call it r choices
for k, there's r choices.

00:52:06.970 --> 00:52:08.740
That's how many
important bits there are.

00:52:08.740 --> 00:52:11.815
So total number of
choices is tr squared.

00:52:14.410 --> 00:52:16.960
But t here is
always less than r.

00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:20.372
So this is going to
be less than r cubed.

00:52:20.372 --> 00:52:22.330
So that means there is
less than r cubed things

00:52:22.330 --> 00:52:23.560
we have to avoid.

00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:25.740
But I have r cubed
allowable choices

00:52:25.740 --> 00:52:27.100
on working modulo r cubed.

00:52:27.100 --> 00:52:30.020
So I just pick any one
that avoids the collision.

00:52:30.020 --> 00:52:33.340
This is basically deterministic
hashing, in a certain sense.

00:52:33.340 --> 00:52:35.680
We are choosing these
values deterministically

00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:39.231
to avoid collisions in
this simple hash function.

00:52:39.231 --> 00:52:39.730
OK.

00:52:39.730 --> 00:52:40.805
It takes time.

00:52:40.805 --> 00:52:43.180
It's going to take polynomial
time to compute this thing.

00:52:43.180 --> 00:52:45.329
And you can imagine if
you just plug in hashing,

00:52:45.329 --> 00:52:46.870
this will work with
some probability,

00:52:46.870 --> 00:52:47.745
and blah, blah, blah.

00:52:47.745 --> 00:52:50.590
But I want to make it always
work deterministically.

00:52:50.590 --> 00:52:54.681
Because we know what
the xi's are here.

00:52:54.681 --> 00:52:55.180
All right.

00:52:55.180 --> 00:52:56.930
So we've avoided collisions.

00:52:56.930 --> 00:52:57.880
There's enough space.

00:52:57.880 --> 00:52:59.110
That's all.

00:52:59.110 --> 00:53:00.540
That was step one.

00:53:00.540 --> 00:53:04.540
Step two, and this
will solve property a,

00:53:04.540 --> 00:53:06.154
even modulo r cubed.

00:53:06.154 --> 00:53:07.570
Now we have a
little bit of space.

00:53:07.570 --> 00:53:09.470
We're allowed to go
up to r to the fourth.

00:53:09.470 --> 00:53:12.560
And now we just need to
spread out these bits.

00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:17.200
So that's step two.

00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:21.520
Basically we're going to set
mi to be these values that we

00:53:21.520 --> 00:53:32.680
chose plus this weird thing,
w minus bi plus ir cubed

00:53:32.680 --> 00:53:42.810
rounded down to a
multiple of r cubed.

00:53:45.718 --> 00:53:50.360
So I guess you could put this
in parentheses if you want.

00:53:50.360 --> 00:53:55.400
Rough idea is, we want to
take mi prime plus ir cubed.

00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:57.780
Because these mi primes,
they're all values between 0,

00:53:57.780 --> 00:53:59.450
and r cubed minus 1.

00:53:59.450 --> 00:54:03.230
We got everything
working modulo r cubed.

00:54:03.230 --> 00:54:06.320
If we could just add ir
cubed to each of these values

00:54:06.320 --> 00:54:08.770
that we'll spread them out.

00:54:08.770 --> 00:54:10.810
Because each of these
values used to fall just

00:54:10.810 --> 00:54:12.250
in this tiny range ir cubed.

00:54:12.250 --> 00:54:15.940
So we can move the next
one to the next position,

00:54:15.940 --> 00:54:18.130
move the next one to the
next position, and so on.

00:54:18.130 --> 00:54:21.280
Spread them out to
the left by adding

00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:25.840
on multiples of r cubed, then
that will achieve property b.

00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:31.510
The annoying issue here is
we don't want to mess things

00:54:31.510 --> 00:54:33.230
up modulo r cubed.

00:54:33.230 --> 00:54:35.050
So we need to round
things down to be

00:54:35.050 --> 00:54:44.617
a multiple of r cubed so that
this is congruent to mi prime.

00:54:44.617 --> 00:54:45.450
That's what we want.

00:54:45.450 --> 00:54:47.520
We want it to stay
congruent to mod r cubed.

00:54:49.971 --> 00:54:52.470
Well, why do we need to round
down to a multiple of r cubed?

00:54:52.470 --> 00:54:54.690
We were adding on ir cubed.

00:54:54.690 --> 00:54:56.850
Well, it's not quite
mi that we care about.

00:54:56.850 --> 00:54:58.860
It's mi plus bi.

00:54:58.860 --> 00:55:02.260
Those are the bits that we
want to be nicely ordered.

00:55:02.260 --> 00:55:05.790
And so we kind of
need a minus bi here,

00:55:05.790 --> 00:55:10.030
so that when we take mi
plus bi, those cancel.

00:55:10.030 --> 00:55:12.990
But then bi is not a
multiple of r cubed.

00:55:12.990 --> 00:55:15.150
So you've got to do this
rounding down to r cubed.

00:55:15.150 --> 00:55:17.870
Also negative bi is
a negative number.

00:55:17.870 --> 00:55:19.920
And we can't really deal
with negative numbers.

00:55:19.920 --> 00:55:21.810
Because you can't go left of 0.

00:55:21.810 --> 00:55:25.080
So we have to add on this w
just to make things work out.

00:55:25.080 --> 00:55:27.720
So it's a little
messy, and I don't

00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:31.440
want to spend too much time
on why this formula works.

00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:33.750
But I think you have the
essence of what's working.

00:55:33.750 --> 00:55:36.150
This is just to avoid
negative numbers.

00:55:36.150 --> 00:55:43.200
This negative bi is so that when
you add it to mi that cancels.

00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:47.129
And so you get these
r cubes separations.

00:55:47.129 --> 00:55:48.920
In the end, let me draw
a picture, perhaps.

00:56:09.860 --> 00:56:17.520
In the end, if you look at the
bit space, so this is w bits.

00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:21.080
And you divide it up into
multiples of r cubed.

00:56:24.710 --> 00:56:30.360
All of the mi primes
are over here.

00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:31.670
So these are mi primes.

00:56:31.670 --> 00:56:33.420
You don't know in what
order or anything.

00:56:33.420 --> 00:56:36.003
They're just kind of randomly
in there, and chosen pretty much

00:56:36.003 --> 00:56:38.600
arbitrarily on the low
end of the spectrum,

00:56:38.600 --> 00:56:41.550
from 0 to r cubed minus 1.

00:56:41.550 --> 00:56:46.550
And then what we want
is for x0 plus m0

00:56:46.550 --> 00:56:50.540
to fall somewhere in this
range, and then x1 plus m1

00:56:50.540 --> 00:56:54.140
to fall somewhere in this
range, and x2 plus m2

00:56:54.140 --> 00:56:57.350
to fall somewhere in this range.

00:56:57.350 --> 00:57:00.620
If I do that, and it's
weird because the bits

00:57:00.620 --> 00:57:03.140
are numbered from
0 to the left here.

00:57:03.140 --> 00:57:06.680
Then I will have this property.

00:57:06.680 --> 00:57:10.070
I claim this
assignment does that.

00:57:10.070 --> 00:57:15.140
It's an exercise you can check
that indeed xi plus mi will

00:57:15.140 --> 00:57:16.250
fall in this range.

00:57:21.410 --> 00:57:24.620
So this gives us property b.

00:57:24.620 --> 00:57:26.680
It also gives us property c.

00:57:26.680 --> 00:57:29.120
Because we've been
fairly tight here.

00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:37.520
There's r of these guys, and
r of these intervals of size r

00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:38.380
cubed.

00:57:38.380 --> 00:57:40.580
And so the total
range of these bits

00:57:40.580 --> 00:57:43.040
is going to be r to the fourth.

00:57:43.040 --> 00:57:44.810
We started at x0 plus m0.

00:57:44.810 --> 00:57:49.790
We end at xr minus
1, plus, mr minus 1.

00:57:49.790 --> 00:57:52.530
That's going to
be somewhere here.

00:57:52.530 --> 00:57:55.050
But if you look at just
that interval of bits--

00:57:55.050 --> 00:58:01.560
so there are more bits actually
over here, in particular,

00:58:01.560 --> 00:58:04.040
because of this w bit part.

00:58:04.040 --> 00:58:08.650
This whole picture
basically starts at bit w.

00:58:08.650 --> 00:58:10.862
Then there's all
this stuff to 0.

00:58:10.862 --> 00:58:12.320
So this is a more
accurate picture.

00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:14.370
You're doing this
multiplication.

00:58:14.370 --> 00:58:15.500
Garbage happens here.

00:58:15.500 --> 00:58:16.970
We have no idea.

00:58:16.970 --> 00:58:18.194
Garbage happens here.

00:58:18.194 --> 00:58:18.860
We have no idea.

00:58:18.860 --> 00:58:21.390
Actually, garbage
happens all over here.

00:58:21.390 --> 00:58:23.990
But what we know
is that these bits

00:58:23.990 --> 00:58:27.350
are the bits we care about.

00:58:27.350 --> 00:58:31.010
These are the xi plus mi bits.

00:58:31.010 --> 00:58:35.930
If you look at xi plus
mi, they give you xbi.

00:58:35.930 --> 00:58:37.160
They exist in other places.

00:58:37.160 --> 00:58:41.410
But these bits will
have the important bits.

00:58:41.410 --> 00:58:44.240
Now the bits are also
all over everywhere else.

00:58:44.240 --> 00:58:45.770
But none of the
bits hit each other.

00:58:45.770 --> 00:58:49.490
So these bits remain
correct, because nothing else

00:58:49.490 --> 00:58:51.110
collides with it.

00:58:51.110 --> 00:58:55.270
And so if I just mask
out those bits, again,

00:58:55.270 --> 00:58:57.670
so I have to do another mask.

00:58:57.670 --> 00:58:59.830
I did one mask here.

00:58:59.830 --> 00:59:03.100
I did a multiplication, and
then I have to do another mask.

00:59:06.310 --> 00:59:08.330
So why don't I
write it over here?

00:59:08.330 --> 00:59:25.570
So we AND with sum i
equal 0 to r minus 1 of 2

00:59:25.570 --> 00:59:29.800
to the bi plus mi.

00:59:29.800 --> 00:59:32.330
Those are the circled bits.

00:59:32.330 --> 00:59:39.385
So if we grab those things,
and then we shift right by--

00:59:42.859 --> 00:59:45.081
why am I writing x?

00:59:45.081 --> 00:59:45.580
Sorry.

00:59:45.580 --> 00:59:46.480
These are all b's.

00:59:50.040 --> 00:59:53.180
Too many letters.

00:59:53.180 --> 00:59:56.730
We shift right by b0 plus m0.

00:59:56.730 --> 00:59:59.650
Because we don't care about
all those leading bits.

00:59:59.650 --> 01:00:01.320
So we shift this
over to the left.

01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:05.040
We did the mask, then we will
just have the important bits

01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:09.910
and they will occupy over here
an interval of size at most--

01:00:09.910 --> 01:00:12.330
I'll say order r to the fourth.

01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:18.330
Clear?

01:00:18.330 --> 01:00:20.710
So this is
approximate sketching.

01:00:20.710 --> 01:00:26.630
This is definitely a bit
complicated, but it works.

01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:28.150
Let me review briefly.

01:00:28.150 --> 01:00:31.890
So, our algorithm was simple.

01:00:31.890 --> 01:00:33.310
We have a bit string, x.

01:00:33.310 --> 01:00:34.900
We just want to get
the important bits

01:00:34.900 --> 01:00:38.950
and compress them to a thing
of size r to the fourth.

01:00:38.950 --> 01:00:41.350
So first of all, we threw away
all the non-important bits

01:00:41.350 --> 01:00:42.410
with this mask.

01:00:42.410 --> 01:00:43.460
That was easy.

01:00:43.460 --> 01:00:46.240
Then we just did an
arbitrary multiplication,

01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:49.120
and we proved that there
was a multiplication that

01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:50.660
avoided collision.

01:00:50.660 --> 01:00:54.760
So the sums basically
turned into ORs or XORs.

01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:57.420
I mean you never get two
1 bits hitting each other,

01:00:57.420 --> 01:00:59.230
so you don't have
to worry about that.

01:00:59.230 --> 01:01:02.360
And we did that with the
simple inductive argument.

01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:04.840
And then we also wanted
the bi's plus mi's

01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:06.450
to be linearly ordered.

01:01:06.450 --> 01:01:08.950
Because we need to preserve the
order of the important bits.

01:01:08.950 --> 01:01:11.800
We can't just permute them.

01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:14.410
And we needed them to
occupy a small range.

01:01:14.410 --> 01:01:16.249
And we did that
basically by adding

01:01:16.249 --> 01:01:17.290
ir cubed to each of them.

01:01:17.290 --> 01:01:19.206
But it was a little messy
and we had to add w,

01:01:19.206 --> 01:01:22.060
and blah-blah-blah.

01:01:22.060 --> 01:01:24.790
But in the end, we
got our important bits

01:01:24.790 --> 01:01:28.480
to be nicely spaced out
here by pretty much putting

01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:31.390
an r cubed in between each one.

01:01:31.390 --> 01:01:33.670
So those were our
bi plus mi bits.

01:01:33.670 --> 01:01:35.599
They occupied this range
of r to the fourth.

01:01:35.599 --> 01:01:37.390
We'll mask out all the
rest of the garbage.

01:01:37.390 --> 01:01:39.890
Because this multiplication
made a quadratic number of bits.

01:01:39.890 --> 01:01:43.360
We only want these r bits,
the r squared 1 bits in here.

01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:45.280
We'll mask away all the others.

01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:47.210
Take these bits,
shift them over.

01:01:47.210 --> 01:01:51.450
Now they occupy a nice interval
at the beginning size order r

01:01:51.450 --> 01:01:53.560
to the fourth.

01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:56.440
And that's our
approximate sketch.

01:01:56.440 --> 01:02:00.230
So sketch should only take
r, but we're being sloppy.

01:02:00.230 --> 01:02:02.230
With this multiplication
trick, the best we know

01:02:02.230 --> 01:02:03.646
is to get down to
r to the fourth.

01:02:03.646 --> 01:02:07.440
And that's good enough.

01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:10.400
And that's why I set everything
to w to the one fifth.

01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:12.640
Because this is w to the 4/5.

01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:14.960
We're going to have
w to the 1/5 of them.

01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:16.900
And so if you take
these sketches

01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:20.940
and you concatenate them, fuse
them together if you will,

01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:22.700
and that's fusion trees.

01:02:22.700 --> 01:02:28.690
Then the sketches of all of
the keys x0 up to xk minus 1

01:02:28.690 --> 01:02:31.980
will occupy order 1 words.

01:02:31.980 --> 01:02:36.180
Because it's order w bits, w
to the 4/5 times w to the 1/5.

01:02:39.730 --> 01:02:45.250
Which brings us to
parallel comparison.

01:02:45.250 --> 01:02:47.860
I have all of these
approximate sketches.

01:02:47.860 --> 01:02:50.620
So you could start forgetting
approximate sketching.

01:02:50.620 --> 01:02:53.410
Somehow, we get these
w to the 4/5 bits.

01:02:53.410 --> 01:02:56.050
We want to concatenate them
together, and then in parallel

01:02:56.050 --> 01:03:00.690
compare all of them
to the sketch of q.

01:03:00.690 --> 01:03:02.620
The sketch of the xi's
we can preprocess.

01:03:02.620 --> 01:03:04.420
We can actually
spend a lot of time

01:03:04.420 --> 01:03:06.057
finding the sketch function.

01:03:06.057 --> 01:03:07.890
But then we have to fix
the sketch function.

01:03:07.890 --> 01:03:10.610
We have to be able to compute
a sketch of q in constant time.

01:03:10.610 --> 01:03:11.680
That's what we just did.

01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:15.130
Sketch of q is one AND one
multiplication and another AND.

01:03:15.130 --> 01:03:17.530
So computing sketches is fast.

01:03:17.530 --> 01:03:20.110
That's the steps of
computing sketch of q.

01:03:20.110 --> 01:03:23.080
Now, next step is find it
among the sketch of the xi's.

01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:25.525
So this is the next thing
we want to make fast.

01:03:42.050 --> 01:03:43.494
It's actually pretty easy.

01:03:43.494 --> 01:03:45.410
You probably know you
can compare two integers

01:03:45.410 --> 01:03:47.400
by subtracting one
from the other.

01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:50.090
So we're just going to do
that, but in a clever way,

01:03:50.090 --> 01:03:53.390
so we can do k subtractions
for the price of one.

01:04:03.976 --> 01:04:08.600
I'm going to define the sketch
of a node to be 1 bit followed

01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:19.985
by the sketch of x0 dot, dot,
dot, 1 sketch of xk minus one.

01:04:19.985 --> 01:04:26.850
And I'm going to define a
sketch of q to the k-th power,

01:04:26.850 --> 01:04:32.385
so to speak, to be a 0 bit
followed by sketch of q, dot,

01:04:32.385 --> 01:04:36.530
dot dot, zero bit sketch of q.

01:04:39.860 --> 01:04:42.620
This is aligning
things, so that if I

01:04:42.620 --> 01:04:44.990
did this subtraction
and this one,

01:04:44.990 --> 01:04:48.770
I would basically be comparing
q with all the xi's at once.

01:04:52.490 --> 01:04:55.070
The point is these sketches--
this is the thing that

01:04:55.070 --> 01:04:57.110
fits in order 1 words.

01:04:57.110 --> 01:05:00.650
These sketches are
w to the 4/5 bits,

01:05:00.650 --> 01:05:02.690
and there's w to
the 1/5 of them.

01:05:02.690 --> 01:05:04.360
So this whole thing
is order w bits.

01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:06.350
So it fits in one word.

01:05:06.350 --> 01:05:07.850
This thing also.

01:05:07.850 --> 01:05:10.280
It happens to be the same
bits repeated many times

01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:13.310
but also it fits in one word.

01:05:13.310 --> 01:05:15.920
How do I compute this thing?

01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:19.330
I can do it with multiplication.

01:05:19.330 --> 01:05:33.600
It's sketch of q times
0000001, 000000001.

01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:36.990
So, ahead of time, I'll just
pre-compute this bit string

01:05:36.990 --> 01:05:43.010
that has 1's at the rightmost
slot for each of these k

01:05:43.010 --> 01:05:44.665
fields.

01:05:44.665 --> 01:05:46.790
If I just take that and
multiply it by sketch of q,

01:05:46.790 --> 01:05:48.330
then I get this.

01:05:48.330 --> 01:05:52.250
So this is easy to do
in one multiplication.

01:05:52.250 --> 01:05:55.530
Now, I take this thing
minus this thing.

01:05:59.450 --> 01:06:01.800
I take the difference.

01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:08.340
And the key thing is because
I put these 1 bits here, I'm

01:06:08.340 --> 01:06:09.600
taking this minus this.

01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:12.630
The point is either this 1 bit
will get borrowed when I do

01:06:12.630 --> 01:06:14.730
binary subtraction, or it won't.

01:06:14.730 --> 01:06:17.574
It gets borrowed when
this is bigger than this,

01:06:17.574 --> 01:06:18.990
otherwise it doesn't
get borrowed.

01:06:18.990 --> 01:06:22.740
So I'm going to
get either a 0 or 1

01:06:22.740 --> 01:06:24.510
here, and then
some garbage which

01:06:24.510 --> 01:06:30.430
I don't care about, and a 0 or
a 1 here, and then some garbage.

01:06:30.430 --> 01:06:34.110
And I'll just mask that out.

01:06:34.110 --> 01:06:44.760
I'm ANDing with 10000, 100000.

01:06:44.760 --> 01:06:49.650
And so I end up just with
01 bits and the rest 0's.

01:06:57.290 --> 01:07:00.440
And these bits,
if I get it right,

01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:12.410
it's 1 if the sketch
of q is less than

01:07:12.410 --> 01:07:15.250
or equal to the sketch of xi.

01:07:17.870 --> 01:07:26.560
And it's 0 if the sketch of q is
greater than the sketch of xi.

01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:29.150
Because when it's greater
that's when the borrow happens.

01:07:29.150 --> 01:07:30.860
And then the 1 turns into a 0.

01:07:30.860 --> 01:07:37.130
So 1's indicate the query is
too small or they're just right.

01:07:37.130 --> 01:07:40.370
And 0's indicate
that they're greater.

01:07:40.370 --> 01:07:43.220
Now the xi's were in order.

01:07:43.220 --> 01:07:46.500
So probably x0 is too small.

01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:48.530
And so this bit will
end up being a 0.

01:07:48.530 --> 01:07:50.340
Probably xk this
plus 1 is too big.

01:07:50.340 --> 01:07:51.920
So this bit will be a 1.

01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:54.680
In general, it's going to be
a monotone sequence of bits.

01:07:54.680 --> 01:07:58.940
If you look at these
bits, these 01 bits,

01:07:58.940 --> 01:08:01.940
they are going to be monotone.

01:08:01.940 --> 01:08:07.750
They'll be 0 for a while,
and then at some point

01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:10.120
they'll switch to being 1's.

01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:14.740
And that transition from 0 to
1 that's what we want to find.

01:08:14.740 --> 01:08:16.660
These keys are too small.

01:08:16.660 --> 01:08:18.020
These keys are too big.

01:08:18.020 --> 01:08:21.220
This key is just right.

01:08:21.220 --> 01:08:23.529
So we fit between--

01:08:23.529 --> 01:08:26.890
this would be position
i and position i plus 1.

01:08:26.890 --> 01:08:28.830
And we fit between
xi and xi plus 1.

01:08:28.830 --> 01:08:30.899
Well, not actually
xi and xi plus 1.

01:08:30.899 --> 01:08:35.014
We fit between sketch of
xi and sketch of xi plus 1.

01:08:35.014 --> 01:08:36.180
That's what we need to find.

01:08:36.180 --> 01:08:38.170
Now that is again the
problem of finding

01:08:38.170 --> 01:08:40.810
the most significant 1 bit.

01:08:40.810 --> 01:08:44.882
But in this case, I don't
need that operation.

01:08:44.882 --> 01:08:46.090
I can do it in a simpler way.

01:08:50.691 --> 01:08:51.899
But we're almost done, right?

01:08:51.899 --> 01:08:53.690
We've done all of this
parallel comparison.

01:08:53.690 --> 01:08:57.990
We just need to find that
transition between 0's and 1's.

01:08:57.990 --> 01:08:59.594
Turns out there's a
cool way to do it.

01:09:10.462 --> 01:09:21.600
The cool way is multiply that
word times our good friend,

01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:29.612
this thing, 000001, 000001.

01:09:29.612 --> 01:09:31.350
This is a little
harder to think about.

01:09:31.350 --> 01:09:35.399
But take this bit string
and multiply it by this.

01:09:35.399 --> 01:09:38.130
What that does is it
takes this string.

01:09:38.130 --> 01:09:38.760
It includes it.

01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:40.260
Because there's a 1 right there.

01:09:40.260 --> 01:09:44.399
It shifts it over by one field,
and includes it, shifts it over

01:09:44.399 --> 01:09:46.380
by another field, includes it.

01:09:46.380 --> 01:09:48.000
So this repeats this thing.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.760
And now collision happens,
because they're perfectly

01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:51.720
aligned.

01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:55.490
If these 1 bits ever hit each
other, they'll be summing.

01:09:55.490 --> 01:09:58.440
Now, some of them are
0, some of them are 1.

01:09:58.440 --> 01:10:01.200
Instead of computing
the position of the 0

01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:03.300
to 1 transition, we could
equivalently just count

01:10:03.300 --> 01:10:05.337
how many 1's are there.

01:10:05.337 --> 01:10:06.920
I mean that's counting
from the right,

01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:10.870
whereas this is counting of from
the left, whatever, same thing.

01:10:10.870 --> 01:10:13.020
So if I could count how
many 1's I'd be all set.

01:10:13.020 --> 01:10:21.460
And in this case, if
you look at right here,

01:10:21.460 --> 01:10:25.570
this will be the
number of 1's I claim.

01:10:25.570 --> 01:10:29.070
Because if this one was
there, it will stay there.

01:10:29.070 --> 01:10:31.860
And then all the other bits
get shifted over and fall

01:10:31.860 --> 01:10:34.380
right here on top of this bit.

01:10:34.380 --> 01:10:36.690
So as they get added up,
you'll get some carries

01:10:36.690 --> 01:10:38.460
and things will move over.

01:10:38.460 --> 01:10:39.930
But this is not very big.

01:10:39.930 --> 01:10:43.450
Because we're
talking about k bits.

01:10:43.450 --> 01:10:45.400
So this is only going
to be with log k.

01:10:47.811 --> 01:10:49.560
I mean there's tons
of room here before we

01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:51.622
get to the next shift.

01:10:51.622 --> 01:10:52.830
So I just look at these bits.

01:10:52.830 --> 01:10:53.550
I mask them out.

01:10:53.550 --> 01:10:54.570
I shift them over.

01:10:54.570 --> 01:10:57.340
And that gives me
the number of 1's.

01:10:57.340 --> 01:11:00.600
This is a cute way to count the
number of ones in a bit string

01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:03.330
when the bits are
spread out nicely.

01:11:03.330 --> 01:11:05.590
They have to be at least
log k away from each other.

01:11:05.590 --> 01:11:06.807
Otherwise you get collision.

01:11:06.807 --> 01:11:08.640
It doesn't work for an
arbitrary bit string.

01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:10.590
But for a bit string
like this, we're all set.

01:11:10.590 --> 01:11:12.090
We can count how
many 1's there are.

01:11:12.090 --> 01:11:16.500
Then we figure out where
this transition is.

01:11:16.500 --> 01:11:19.410
That is parallel comparison.

01:11:19.410 --> 01:11:27.422
One more thing to do, which
is most significant set bit.

01:11:33.800 --> 01:11:38.640
The place we needed this, was
we were taking the XOR of q

01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:39.824
with xi.

01:11:39.824 --> 01:11:41.490
And then we wanted
to find the first bit

01:11:41.490 --> 01:11:42.966
where they were differing.

01:11:42.966 --> 01:11:44.340
So after you take
the XOR, you've

01:11:44.340 --> 01:11:47.440
got some bit string
that looks like this.

01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:49.710
And you want to find
this bit, because that's

01:11:49.710 --> 01:11:51.180
the place you diverged.

01:11:51.180 --> 01:11:53.730
Then we would turn that to 0
and change the rest to 1's.

01:11:53.730 --> 01:11:56.852
That's easy to do if we
know where this bit is.

01:11:56.852 --> 01:11:58.560
And this is a generally
useful operation.

01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:03.720
It's used all over computer
science, I would say.

01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:06.750
So much so that most CPUs
have it as an instruction,

01:12:06.750 --> 01:12:10.130
so on Intel it's called CLZ.

01:12:10.130 --> 01:12:11.850
And it has many names.

01:12:11.850 --> 01:12:13.290
They're in the notes.

01:12:13.290 --> 01:12:15.390
Most compilers
provide this to you

01:12:15.390 --> 01:12:18.120
as an operation on
architectures that have it,

01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:20.035
otherwise they simulate it.

01:12:20.035 --> 01:12:21.660
They probably don't
simulate it as well

01:12:21.660 --> 01:12:22.972
as I'm going to tell you.

01:12:22.972 --> 01:12:24.930
Because we're going to
do this in constant time

01:12:24.930 --> 01:12:27.920
on a regular word RAM,
just C operations,

01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:31.620
which does not seem to have
made it into popular culture.

01:12:31.620 --> 01:12:36.600
It's slightly
complicated, which is why.

01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:38.624
But what's cool is
we're going to use--

01:12:38.624 --> 01:12:40.290
I'm going to do this
relatively quickly.

01:12:40.290 --> 01:12:42.000
Because I don't
have a ton of time.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:46.310
We're going to use all the
things that we just did again,

01:12:46.310 --> 01:12:47.020
quickly.

01:12:47.020 --> 01:12:49.710
Most of them just
as black boxes.

01:12:49.710 --> 01:12:51.010
All right.

01:12:51.010 --> 01:12:53.700
So, here's what
we're going to do.

01:12:53.700 --> 01:12:56.220
Maybe I should go somewhere new.

01:13:01.430 --> 01:13:03.857
So, I'm going to use sketches,
not approximate sketches,

01:13:03.857 --> 01:13:04.940
but I'm going to sketches.

01:13:04.940 --> 01:13:06.273
I'm going to use multiplication.

01:13:06.273 --> 01:13:08.430
I'm going to use
parallel comparison.

01:13:08.430 --> 01:13:10.930
And in some sense I'm going to
use most significant set bit.

01:13:10.930 --> 01:13:13.010
All of these things
I'm going to use

01:13:13.010 --> 01:13:15.438
to solve the most
significant set bit problem.

01:13:25.410 --> 01:13:26.390
So here's what we do.

01:13:26.390 --> 01:13:41.270
We split the word into root
w clusters of root w bits.

01:13:41.270 --> 01:13:41.990
Sound familiar?

01:13:41.990 --> 01:13:44.370
This is exactly what we
did in van Emde Boas.

01:13:44.370 --> 01:13:46.070
So van Emde Boas did
this recursively.

01:13:46.070 --> 01:13:47.360
We're going to do it once.

01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:49.890
We can only afford
constant time.

01:13:49.890 --> 01:13:51.170
So here's an example.

01:13:51.170 --> 01:14:03.590
x is 0101, 0000, 1000, 1101.

01:14:03.590 --> 01:14:05.660
So each of these is root w bits.

01:14:05.660 --> 01:14:07.712
There's root w of them.

01:14:07.712 --> 01:14:08.420
It's approximate.

01:14:08.420 --> 01:14:09.710
It doesn't it to be exactly.

01:14:09.710 --> 01:14:13.310
But we'll assume x is
a nice power of two,

01:14:13.310 --> 01:14:14.390
so that works cleanly.

01:14:18.140 --> 01:14:21.200
So the first thing, so what
the high level idea is I

01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:23.090
need to find the first
non-empty cluster.

01:14:23.090 --> 01:14:25.100
Here it happens to
be the first cluster.

01:14:25.100 --> 01:14:29.300
And then I need to find the
first 1 bit within the cluster.

01:14:29.300 --> 01:14:32.480
Hard part is finding the
first non-empty cluster.

01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:34.640
Actually, the hard
part or the messy part

01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:36.350
is finding which
clusters are empty

01:14:36.350 --> 01:14:37.580
and which clusters are not.

01:14:37.580 --> 01:14:38.690
This cluster is not empty.

01:14:38.690 --> 01:14:40.130
This cluster is empty.

01:14:40.130 --> 01:14:41.280
These are non-empty.

01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:45.740
So I want the summary
vector which is 1011.

01:14:45.740 --> 01:14:49.140
I claim if I can do that,
everything else is easy.

01:14:49.140 --> 01:14:56.660
So let's spend some time on
identifying non-empty clusters.

01:15:03.380 --> 01:15:11.000
First thing I do is I take x,
ANDed with this thing, which

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:25.400
I'm going to call F, 1000,
1000, 1000, 1000; F for first.

01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:29.270
So I'm just seeing which
of these first bits

01:15:29.270 --> 01:15:31.280
in each cluster are set.

01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:42.890
So the result is I get
0000, 0000, 1000, and 1000.

01:15:42.890 --> 01:15:46.190
So in particular that tells me
this cluster and this cluster

01:15:46.190 --> 01:15:49.837
are non-empty, because they
have the first bit set.

01:15:49.837 --> 01:15:51.170
What about all those other bits?

01:15:51.170 --> 01:15:53.629
Well, the other bits I'm going
to do in a different way.

01:15:53.629 --> 01:15:55.670
Just the first bits, I
need a little bit of room.

01:16:01.310 --> 01:16:03.290
I need this bit of room.

01:16:03.290 --> 01:16:05.790
I want to put these 1's in.

01:16:05.790 --> 01:16:09.290
So I've got to get rid of some
bits to make room for that.

01:16:09.290 --> 01:16:12.540
So this deals with
the first bits.

01:16:12.540 --> 01:16:13.940
Now I'm going to
clear those out.

01:16:13.940 --> 01:16:19.670
So I'm going to take x XOR this.

01:16:19.670 --> 01:16:23.210
And that will give me everything
with the first bits cleared.

01:16:23.210 --> 01:16:34.250
So I've got 0101,
0000, 0000, and 0101.

01:16:34.250 --> 01:16:36.500
These are the rest of the
bits I've got to figure out.

01:16:36.500 --> 01:16:39.260
This one is non-empty
and this one's non-empty.

01:16:39.260 --> 01:16:40.250
How do you do it?

01:16:40.250 --> 01:16:41.488
With subtraction.

01:16:58.920 --> 01:17:02.550
I take F minus that thing.

01:17:06.340 --> 01:17:09.800
This F has 1's, and they're
going to get borrowed.

01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:12.010
When I take F minus this,
this 1 will get borrowed

01:17:12.010 --> 01:17:13.540
because there's something here.

01:17:13.540 --> 01:17:15.582
This one will not get
borrowed because this is 0.

01:17:15.582 --> 01:17:17.623
This one will not get
borrowed because this is 0.

01:17:17.623 --> 01:17:20.200
This one will get borrowed
because there's something here.

01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:21.190
That's it.

01:17:21.190 --> 01:17:24.520
We're comparing
with 0 everything.

01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:29.050
So we're going to get, in
this case, 0 and some garbage,

01:17:29.050 --> 01:17:37.210
1 and 0's, 1, and 0
with some garbage.

01:17:37.210 --> 01:17:38.540
I just care about these bits.

01:17:38.540 --> 01:17:41.350
These are the bits that tell
me which ones were empty.

01:17:41.350 --> 01:17:42.340
The 0's are empty.

01:17:42.340 --> 01:17:44.230
The 1's are non-empty.

01:17:44.230 --> 01:17:46.020
So I do a mask.

01:17:46.020 --> 01:17:51.415
I get 0, and some 0's, 1 and
some 0's, 1 and some 0's 0

01:17:51.415 --> 01:17:53.930
and some 0's.

01:17:53.930 --> 01:17:54.850
OK.

01:17:54.850 --> 01:18:01.120
Then I do an XOR with F. Because
I really want 1 for these guys,

01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:03.340
and 0 for these guys.

01:18:03.340 --> 01:18:05.350
1 means it's not empty.

01:18:05.350 --> 01:18:06.460
0 means it's empty.

01:18:10.645 --> 01:18:11.650
I got that right.

01:18:11.650 --> 01:18:15.110
So I'm just inverting the 0
bits to 1 bits, and vice versa.

01:18:15.110 --> 01:18:17.112
So 1 means this one's not empty.

01:18:17.112 --> 01:18:18.320
1 means this one's not empty.

01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:20.340
Those are the non-empty guys.

01:18:20.340 --> 01:18:26.760
I take this and I OR
it with this thing.

01:18:29.819 --> 01:18:31.360
This was the thing
that told me which

01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:33.850
ones had that first bit set.

01:18:33.850 --> 01:18:37.909
So if I take the OR of those
two I learn, or any bit set.

01:18:37.909 --> 01:18:40.075
Because this was dealing
with all of the other bits.

01:18:48.150 --> 01:18:50.790
I threw away this bit,
but I had to remember

01:18:50.790 --> 01:18:51.870
that it was non-empty.

01:18:51.870 --> 01:18:52.370
OK.

01:18:52.370 --> 01:18:53.160
So I take that OR.

01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:55.920
Now, this tells me those
three blocks were not empty.

01:18:55.920 --> 01:18:57.550
This one was empty.

01:18:57.550 --> 01:19:01.440
So now here I have the
bits that I care about.

01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:03.420
Sadly they're spread out.

01:19:03.420 --> 01:19:05.190
I'd really like them compressed.

01:19:05.190 --> 01:19:06.360
So I do that with sketch.

01:19:09.130 --> 01:19:13.186
I want to compress them to 1011.

01:19:13.186 --> 01:19:15.150
It would fit in one
little thing here.

01:19:15.150 --> 01:19:16.180
Because this is root w.

01:19:16.180 --> 01:19:17.790
There's root w of them.

01:19:17.790 --> 01:19:19.740
Sadly, I can't use
approximate sketch.

01:19:19.740 --> 01:19:22.170
Because I don't
have enough space.

01:19:22.170 --> 01:19:24.210
This is w to the 1/2.

01:19:24.210 --> 01:19:27.420
If I used approximate
sketch I get w--

01:19:27.420 --> 01:19:31.410
I'd lose this factor of
4 and be bigger than w.

01:19:31.410 --> 01:19:34.490
I really need it to
be perfectly sketched.

01:19:34.490 --> 01:19:38.160
Conveniently, you can do
perfect sketch in this regime.

01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:40.004
Before the bi's were
arbitrary things.

01:19:40.004 --> 01:19:41.670
We had no idea how
they were spread out.

01:19:41.670 --> 01:19:47.700
Here bi is root w minus
1-- that's the first one--

01:19:47.700 --> 01:19:49.830
plus i times root w.

01:19:49.830 --> 01:19:54.750
They're nicely uniformly
spaced by i root w.

01:19:54.750 --> 01:19:55.560
In this case--

01:19:58.308 --> 01:20:00.270
I'm running out of time--

01:20:00.270 --> 01:20:09.792
I claim you can use mj equal to
w minus root w minus 1 minus j

01:20:09.792 --> 01:20:12.884
root w plus j.

01:20:12.884 --> 01:20:14.050
And I won't go to the proof.

01:20:14.050 --> 01:20:15.930
There's a sketch in the notes.

01:20:15.930 --> 01:20:19.620
If you do this, this is
a nice setting of mj.

01:20:19.620 --> 01:20:22.490
It turns out you will get bi--

01:20:22.490 --> 01:20:27.900
if we look at bi plus mi,
this cancels, this cancels,

01:20:27.900 --> 01:20:29.160
because i equals j.

01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:32.290
You're left with w plus j.

01:20:32.290 --> 01:20:35.890
So in other words, if
you look at bi plus mi,

01:20:35.890 --> 01:20:42.350
you get from bit w to bit
w plus root w minus 1.

01:20:42.350 --> 01:20:44.530
These bits will be exactly
the bits you care about.

01:20:44.530 --> 01:20:45.280
So you take those.

01:20:45.280 --> 01:20:46.690
You mask out the others.

01:20:46.690 --> 01:20:49.150
You shift it over to
the right, and you have

01:20:49.150 --> 01:20:50.800
exactly your perfect sketch.

01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:53.810
The thing you need to prove
here is that bi plus mj are all

01:20:53.810 --> 01:20:54.310
distinct.

01:20:54.310 --> 01:20:55.832
So there's no collisions.

01:20:55.832 --> 01:20:57.790
But in this case it's
easy to avoid collisions.

01:20:57.790 --> 01:21:00.070
You've got all your bits
nice and consecutive.

01:21:00.070 --> 01:21:02.640
Now you've got it
down to this thing.

01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:06.226
OK, not quite done though.

01:21:06.226 --> 01:21:08.290
Only one more minute.

01:21:08.290 --> 01:21:11.770
Let's say-- well,
that was step one.

01:21:11.770 --> 01:21:14.440
Identify non-empty clusters.

01:21:14.440 --> 01:21:17.770
Step two was sketch.

01:21:17.770 --> 01:21:24.490
Step three is find the
first non-empty cluster.

01:21:28.120 --> 01:21:31.710
I claim this is easy.

01:21:31.710 --> 01:21:34.150
So I take this sketch vector.

01:21:34.150 --> 01:21:37.040
It only has root w bits.

01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:39.760
So I use parallel comparison.

01:21:44.980 --> 01:21:46.180
What do I compare to?

01:21:46.180 --> 01:21:54.110
I'm going to compare many copies
of this thing to 0001, 0010,

01:21:54.110 --> 01:21:59.020
0100, 1000; the powers of 2.

01:21:59.020 --> 01:22:00.160
So I take this.

01:22:00.160 --> 01:22:04.300
I put them in a vector
like the sketch of a node.

01:22:04.300 --> 01:22:09.760
And I take the k, or I guess
root w copies of the sketch

01:22:09.760 --> 01:22:11.030
of the summary vector.

01:22:11.030 --> 01:22:12.700
That's this 1011.

01:22:12.700 --> 01:22:16.210
So I compare four copies
of this to each of these,

01:22:16.210 --> 01:22:19.150
and I learn which power
of 2 it is greater than.

01:22:19.150 --> 01:22:22.600
In other words, what is the
most significant set bit.

01:22:22.600 --> 01:22:27.252
That's why when I told you
how to do over here, when

01:22:27.252 --> 01:22:28.960
I told you how to do
parallel comparison,

01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:31.084
I didn't want to use
most significant bit

01:22:31.084 --> 01:22:31.750
as a subroutine.

01:22:31.750 --> 01:22:35.110
Because this is a subroutine
to most significant bit.

01:22:35.110 --> 01:22:37.937
Over here, we could just do
this multiplication and boom,

01:22:37.937 --> 01:22:39.520
we found what the
most significant set

01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:41.680
bit was as long as
there was room to fit

01:22:41.680 --> 01:22:43.090
all this stuff in a word.

01:22:43.090 --> 01:22:45.720
And because I've reduced
everything to size root w,

01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:48.314
and then only there's
w of these things

01:22:48.314 --> 01:22:50.230
to compare to, because
that's the width of one

01:22:50.230 --> 01:22:51.490
of these fields.

01:22:51.490 --> 01:22:52.534
This all fits in a word.

01:22:52.534 --> 01:22:53.950
I can do this
parallel comparison.

01:22:53.950 --> 01:22:57.580
Boom, I find the first 1 bit
in this bit string, which

01:22:57.580 --> 01:22:59.710
happens to be the first bit.

01:22:59.710 --> 01:23:04.820
That tells me that this cluster
is a cluster I care about.

01:23:04.820 --> 01:23:06.190
So I take those bits out.

01:23:06.190 --> 01:23:08.410
I mask them out,
shift them over,

01:23:08.410 --> 01:23:15.030
and I find the first
1 bit in that cluster.

01:23:15.030 --> 01:23:16.240
How do I do it?

01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:19.480
In exactly the same way,
clusters again, root w bits.

01:23:19.480 --> 01:23:21.310
I can use parallel
comparison to compare it

01:23:21.310 --> 01:23:23.680
to all these things
in constant time.

01:23:23.680 --> 01:23:26.140
I find where the
first 1 bit is there.

01:23:26.140 --> 01:23:33.700
And then I take this cluster
C, I take this bit D,

01:23:33.700 --> 01:23:40.150
and my answer is
C root w plus D.

01:23:40.150 --> 01:23:43.840
That is the final index of
the most significant 1 bit

01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:47.851
in constant time, using all
those fusion tricks once again.

01:23:47.851 --> 01:23:49.600
And that in the end
gives you fusion trees

01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:51.130
on a word RAM static.

01:23:54.030 --> 01:24:00.070
It's complicated, probably
impractical, but pretty cool.

01:24:00.070 --> 01:24:03.540
And we're going to use
these bit tricks again.
