00:00:21.364 --> 00:00:23.530
ERIK DEMAINE: All right,
today we continue our theme

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:25.480
of integer data structures.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.060
And today we're going to look
at priority queues instead

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.850
of the predecessor problem, so
something a little different.

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:33.980
Insert, delete, and find min.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.140
It turns out priority queues
are equivalent to sorting

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:54.022
in the sense that if you have,
normally they say f of n,

00:00:54.022 --> 00:00:56.230
but here we're going to
depend on both n and the word

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.170
size, priority queue.

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.530
Well then, of course you
get a sorting algorithm.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.420
Just insert everything
into the priority queue

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.560
and then find min delete,
find min delete, and so on.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.080
So that's the trivial
direction of the equivalence.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.550
But it turns out, both
of these are true.

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.060
If you have a sorting
algorithm with n times f time,

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.235
then you can convert it
into a priority queue

00:01:30.235 --> 00:01:37.280
that in the worst case every
operation takes only f of n, w.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.550
So that's the equivalence
as the result of Thorpe

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.890
from a few years ago, 2007.

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.180
Kind of a cool breakthrough.

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.730
There were earlier versions
that weren't quite as efficient

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.700
but this gives you perfect
efficiency, turning any sorting

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.050
algorithm into priority queue.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:54.610
Rough sketch of
the data structure

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.790
is you have a bunch of sorting
algorithms which you run now

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.730
and then to get little
parts of the input

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:02.810
in order to build an
overall priority queue.

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.990
But it's very complicated.

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.490
There was an entire
class project

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.699
on assimilating it
and understanding it.

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:13.010
It's a bit beyond what we
can cover in the class.

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.770
So I'm going to
take this as given

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.812
and tell you instead
about sorting algorithms

00:02:16.812 --> 00:02:19.270
because there's a major open
problem here which is, can you

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.470
sort n integers, n w bit
integers in a word ram's,

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.750
word size w in linear time.

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.524
We still don't know but we
have a bunch of results.

00:02:29.524 --> 00:02:30.940
In particular,
we're going to talk

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.460
about a couple
interesting cases where

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.070
we can get linear time sorting.

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.830
If you've seen radix sort you
know another interesting case

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.495
where linear time
sorting is possible.

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.560
Interesting open problem here.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.620
Can you get constant
time decrease key?

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.150
And ideally, also insertion?

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.594
But decrease key would be
handy because then this

00:02:58.594 --> 00:02:59.260
would be useful.

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.630
In this reduction if you
have a sorting algorithm,

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.550
like to get a priority queue
with constant time decrease

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:07.750
key, that would
have applications

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:08.750
to Dijkstra's algorithm.

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.960
Of course, if you can
sort in linear time

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.130
then everything can be
done in constant time.

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.430
So this is not the most
interesting open problem

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.400
but it would be a step
in that direction.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.900
Cool.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:26.365
So let me tell you some
bounds about sorting.

00:03:32.482 --> 00:03:38.556
So we have n w bit integers.

00:03:38.556 --> 00:03:40.180
And you take any of
these bounds divide

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:46.250
by n you get the priority queue
bound, the best that we know.

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:52.690
So of course, there's comparison
sorting, which takes n log n.

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:53.950
So that's an upper bound.

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.070
Trying to beat that.

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.610
Trying to get rid of the log.

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.300
There's a counting sort from
undergraduate algorithms.

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.320
That takes n plus u
time because you need

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.040
to build a table of size u.

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.215
You've got to zero out
all the initial counts

00:04:08.215 --> 00:04:11.320
so that requires order u time.

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:20.470
This is interesting when
the word size equals log n.

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.120
So that's a case of
potential interest,

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.740
because then 2 to
the w is just n.

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.760
So this is linear time.

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.880
But even if w is 2 log n,
radix or 1.1 times log n,

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.250
then this is bigger n log n.

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:34.820
So, not very good.

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:41.110
But we have radix sort,
which is a bit better.

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:49.310
And this is n times
w divided by log n.

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.320
If you do it right you
have some word size w,

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.190
you're using counting sort
for each digit in the radix.

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:01.780
So you can afford that the word
size of doing counting sort

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.010
to be exactly log n.

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.260
Which means you have your
overall word you're dividing

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.210
into chunks of size log n.

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.140
Each of them you can
do in linear time.

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:12.520
So the number of chunks you have
to do is w divided by log n.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:18.040
And this is linear if
w equals order log n.

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:24.010
Right, but only then.

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:28.882
So this buys you a little
bit, but still not great.

00:05:28.882 --> 00:05:30.590
OK, there's some other
sorting algorithms

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:33.860
we've implicitly seen because
we've seen Van Emde Boas.

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.010
I mean, any predecessor
data structure

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:37.760
gives you a priority
queue data structure.

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:42.530
Priority queues-- I didn't
write it, but I mentioned--

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:45.710
insert, delete, find min.

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:50.600
Find min is a weaker operation
than predecessor or successor.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:57.350
So we can take Van Emde Boas's
predecessor data structure

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:01.310
and convert it into a
sorting algorithm and we

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:07.160
get order n times log w.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.130
Now this is a little
bit tricky to compare.

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:12.560
Of course, log w
sounds better than w.

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.110
But there's just divided
by log n, which makes

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:18.620
it a little hard to compare.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:25.160
It turns out there's
another version.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:28.520
You can take this
sorting algorithm

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:33.520
and achieve a bound
of m log w over log n.

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.500
OK, so this is a slight
improvement in here.

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.200
It's similar to your
problem set this week.

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:43.850
This specific
problem was a problem

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:47.370
set in 2005 of this class.

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:48.920
So you can check
it out if you want

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:50.900
to see how to do this
slight improvement.

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:52.814
But now this is clearly
better than this

00:06:52.814 --> 00:06:54.230
because here we
have w over log n.

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:56.070
Here I've got a log in front.

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:58.540
So this is a win
over radex sort.

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:01.820
So Van Emde Boas, here's another
way in which is interesting.

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:05.830
It gives us a strict
improvement over radex sort.

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:14.020
And in particular,
actually both of these

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:22.310
are order n log log n if w
is not too big, poly log n.

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:28.130
This doesn't actually
matter but it's

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:30.710
clearly better than this one.

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:34.490
Again, if w is order log n
you get this to be linear.

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:38.600
But in particular, it says
overall you get n log log n up

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.300
to w being poly log.

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:44.450
OK, why do we care?

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:46.670
Because there's this
other nice algorithm,

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:51.260
signature sort, which
covers all large word sizes.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.570
And this is an algorithm
we will cover today.

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:01.520
It only works when w is
large, and large means

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:04.850
log to the 2 plus epsilon.

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:07.740
And this is no matter
what epsilon is.

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:10.250
In reality, it's probably
log squared times

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:12.140
log log n squared.

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:14.750
But be a little
sloppy and just say,

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:18.410
a little bit bigger
than log squared.

00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:20.640
And then it runs in linear time.

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:25.640
OK, so if you were graphing this
in your mind you've got time

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:28.430
and there's a nice bound
here which is order n.

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:32.960
Then we have everything's
above n log n.

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:35.200
Maybe here we have--

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.260
is hard to draw--

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.590
n log log n.

00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:42.630
This is asymptotic space,
which doesn't really exist,

00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:44.330
but you know what I mean.

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:49.475
And then this is the
word size versus log n.

00:08:49.475 --> 00:08:50.420
Wow, this is hard to--

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:51.800
this is a really weird picture.

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:53.840
I've never drawn this before.

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:58.080
So you know, initially in
a radex sort, OK log n.

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:04.125
We could get linear time
or order log n, great.

00:09:04.125 --> 00:09:05.750
What this is saying
is once you get out

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:10.520
to log the 2 plus epsilon
n you can also do linear.

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:13.180
And from here over
we have linear time.

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:15.840
And here over we
have linear time.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:18.635
So the question is what about
this middle range between log

00:09:18.635 --> 00:09:22.190
n and log to the 2 plus epsilon?

00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:27.530
Well, one thing we could do
is use Van Emde Boas sort,

00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:29.764
get an n log log n bound.

00:09:29.764 --> 00:09:32.180
And so that's one way to fill
in this range in the middle.

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:35.570
And that means overall you can
always sort n integers in n log

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:36.920
log n time.

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:39.620
If w is big you
use signature sort,

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:42.170
if w small use Van
Emde Boas sort.

00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:49.430
So this implies n
log log n for all w.

00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:51.080
So that's something.

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:53.724
It's not the best known.

00:09:53.724 --> 00:10:00.680
Let's see, first result in this
direction was by Han in 2001.

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:10.370
And it achieved this bound,
deterministic and in the ac 0

00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:14.390
ram, so without
using multiplication.

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:17.310
Which, I guess Van Emde
Boas doesn't either,

00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:19.760
unless I'm missing something.

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:21.750
But it got rid of
the randomisation

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:25.800
which is necessary to get
linear space in Van Emde Boas.

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:30.258
The current best
result on sorting

00:10:30.258 --> 00:10:34.330
is by Han and Thorpe in
2002, so a while ago.

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:42.150
They achieved n square
root log w over log n,

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:46.560
which is similar
to this bound, just

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:50.200
has an extra square root here.

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:52.680
So it's a little bit better
than Van Emde Boas sort.

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:53.850
It uses some clever tricks.

00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:54.910
It is randomized.

00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:03.840
So still the best deterministic
bound is n log log n,

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:09.790
And let's see, we can plug
that in for this range here.

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:16.050
And it will imply that
you get n square root log

00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:20.130
log n for all w.

00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:26.340
Because in particular,
if w is poly log n,

00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:28.560
then this is just log log n.

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:31.780
So you get this bound.

00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:35.050
Of course, for all w because
large w are already covered.

00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:39.176
So this sorting algorithm is a
little bit messy, and possibly

00:11:39.176 --> 00:11:40.050
not the right answer.

00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:42.540
I would conjecture you
can sort n integers

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:45.450
in linear time for all w.

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:46.815
But that is a big open problem.

00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:55.050
This is the current
state of the art.

00:11:55.050 --> 00:11:59.300
So this open question is
really about for small w

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:00.870
when w is poly
log n, or actually

00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:03.540
when it's between
log and poly log.

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:06.330
So to give you a piece
of the complete picture

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:08.934
I want to tell you
about signature sort.

00:12:08.934 --> 00:12:11.100
Because I think you have
to use different techniques

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:12.390
when w is small versus large.

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:15.540
We know that from fusion
trees and Van Emde Boas.

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:18.480
So I'll tell you about the
slightly large case when

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:21.090
w is at least log to
the 2 plus epsilon,

00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:22.600
how to get linear time.

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:23.710
And this is fun.

00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:25.950
It uses bit tricks, it
uses a lot of cool ideas,

00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:28.470
uses hashing, lots of things.

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:32.820
It also uses another sorting
algorithm called packed sort.

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:35.310
This doesn't fit in
the regular table

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:38.700
because it's for a situation
when more than one input

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:40.780
number fits in a word.

00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:43.290
So we're going to let b
denote the number of bits

00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:44.340
in the inputs.

00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:46.560
So we have b bit integers.

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:50.460
Then when w is at least
b times log n log log n,

00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:54.540
so you can fit log n log log
n integers in a single word,

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:56.982
then you can sort
them in linear time.

00:12:56.982 --> 00:12:59.190
So it's like your machine
is just a little bit bigger

00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:01.850
than what you'd need to
represent the integers,

00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:04.890
then all sorting can be
done in a linear time.

00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:08.580
And as you might imagine,
this log to the 2 plus epsilon

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:12.660
buys you a little bit of
room with some tricks,

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:15.350
namely hashing.

00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:19.140
Right, that's where we're going.

00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:21.187
And we'll use yet another
sorting algorithm,

00:13:21.187 --> 00:13:22.770
bitonic sort, which
you may have seen.

00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:25.840
It's a sorting network.

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:27.840
It's in CLRS up
to second edition,

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:29.617
but it got removed
from third edition.

00:13:29.617 --> 00:13:31.950
I guess they thought people
didn't use sorting networks,

00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:33.360
but we use sorting
networks here.

00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:39.690
Because it gives us parallel
sorting and the word ram

00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:43.290
is all about using the
parallelism in your word.

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:48.420
So, we'll get to those.

00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:53.300
I'm going to start at the top
level, which is signature sort.

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:55.050
And we're going to
leave things to be done

00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:57.420
and then pack sorting
will be one of them.

00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:59.670
And bitonic sorting will
be used in pack sorting.

00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:03.830
So it's a chain like this.

00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:05.580
Cool.

00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:10.770
So I'm going to
assume my signature

00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:15.990
sort that w is at least
log to 2 pulse epsilon n

00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:18.640
times log log n.

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:23.407
This is really just a change
in what epsilon means.

00:14:23.407 --> 00:14:25.240
If you're given some
particular epsilon make

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:26.906
it a little smaller,
then you can afford

00:14:26.906 --> 00:14:28.560
to add that log log factor.

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:32.260
This is just for convenience.

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:37.927
Now here's the idea.

00:14:37.927 --> 00:14:39.510
It's a pretty cool
idea I have to say.

00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:59.250
It's by Anderson
and others in 1998.

00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:01.896
OK, word size is big,
which is both good and bad.

00:15:01.896 --> 00:15:03.770
It means the numbers we
have to sort are big.

00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:07.600
They have a lot of bits in
them, way more than log n bits.

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:10.090
But also, we have
this powerful machine

00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:13.794
that can handle words
of very large size

00:15:13.794 --> 00:15:15.460
and do things and
constant time on them.

00:15:19.090 --> 00:15:21.160
I'd like to make some slop.

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:23.320
I want my words to be
bigger than my items,

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:26.410
so first few steps
are about doing that.

00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:30.340
The first idea is, well,
you've got this giant word

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:32.020
log to the 2 plus epsilon.

00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:34.840
So let's split it into chunks.

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:40.180
And the number of chunks
is log to the epsilon.

00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:44.200
So that means each chunk is--

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:45.710
well, it could be even bigger.

00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:48.020
So it's at least log squared n.

00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:51.510
But it could be bigger
than that because w

00:15:51.510 --> 00:15:53.572
is at least log to
the 2 plus epsilon.

00:15:53.572 --> 00:15:54.280
So we don't know.

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:57.330
These things are of size w
divided by log to the epsilon

00:15:57.330 --> 00:15:57.830
n.

00:15:57.830 --> 00:16:00.470
So it's at least log squared.

00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:04.970
OK, here's the crazy idea.

00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:07.480
We're thinking of our
number being divided

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:10.180
into these chunks, you
know, it's being represented

00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:15.070
in some base, 2 to the w
divided by log to the epsilon n.

00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:17.510
It's a bit of a mouthful.

00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:20.840
But think about these digits.

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:27.040
I claim if you look at a digit,
most values don't appear.

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:29.920
Because how many values
are there for a digit?

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:33.310
Well, it's at least 2
to the log squared n.

00:16:33.310 --> 00:16:34.220
That's a big number.

00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:36.610
That's way bigger
than polynomial and n.

00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:39.790
But how many different
digits are there?

00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:41.860
Well, there's n
numbers, each of them

00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:47.350
has log to the epsilon n
digits in it appearing.

00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:52.870
And so there's roughly a linear
number of digit values total.

00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:54.850
But the number of
possible digit values

00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:57.010
is 2 to the log log
squared n, which

00:16:57.010 --> 00:17:00.580
is huge, super polynomial.

00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:05.030
So most digit values don't
appear in our numbers.

00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:07.359
So what we're going to
do is hash the digit

00:17:07.359 --> 00:17:09.177
values to reduce their space.

00:17:09.177 --> 00:17:11.760
Because they're currently living
in a universe of 2 to the log

00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:14.444
squared n, but there's
only n times log

00:17:14.444 --> 00:17:16.089
to the epsilon n of them.

00:17:16.089 --> 00:17:23.200
So we should be able to reduce
to have a much smaller universe

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:24.970
using hashing.

00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:30.669
Maybe perfect hashing even.

00:17:30.669 --> 00:17:32.710
I mean, we don't have to
be too intelligent here.

00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:33.585
Tell you what we get.

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:46.120
What I'd like is to reduce
to a polynomial universe.

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:53.380
And another way to say that is
that the hash values are order

00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:54.240
log n bits.

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:57.140
So this lets us go to n
to the 10, or whatever,

00:17:57.140 --> 00:17:58.360
which is plenty of room.

00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:03.050
We take any universal
hash function,

00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:06.250
as soon as you get to
roughly n squared size,

00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:08.380
I mean the square of
the number of things,

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:10.750
by a birthday paradox, constant
probability none of them

00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:12.070
will hit each other.

00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:14.320
That was the second
level of perfect hashing.

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:17.140
We don't need two levels
here, just say OK, user order

00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:17.760
log n bits.

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:20.320
You can set this
to 100, whatever.

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:23.230
Then with high probability
you will not get collisions,

00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:25.300
so none of the chunks
will hit each other.

00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:27.880
So I'm omitting a step
here which is how to--

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:31.370
OK, I'm omitting a
couple of things here.

00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:36.130
One of them is I want to
do this in linear time.

00:18:36.130 --> 00:18:37.967
Everything has to
be in linear time.

00:18:37.967 --> 00:18:39.550
So one front part
is I have to compute

00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:43.210
the hash value of
all of these digits

00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:47.220
in a single word
in constant time.

00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:51.550
So a brief aside, how would
I compute a universal hash

00:18:51.550 --> 00:18:55.240
function of these digits
individually in constant time?

00:18:55.240 --> 00:19:02.230
Well, my personal favorite
universal hashing scheme

00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:03.940
is the multiplication method.

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:08.240
You just need to multiply
by a single value m

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:11.210
and then take it
modular something.

00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:20.690
So if I do
multiplication, I mean

00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:22.490
if you think of there
being something here,

00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:25.475
something here, something here,
something here, something here,

00:19:25.475 --> 00:19:30.481
m does multiply each
of these individually.

00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:36.200
Wow, that's a rough sketch.

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:38.240
I want to hash each of
these guys multiply,

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:40.220
them by the
multiplication method.

00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:42.800
This would work fine,
except you get overflows,

00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:44.340
which is a bit messy.

00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:47.210
So in fact, I'm going to have
to do it for the odd guys

00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:50.390
first, multiply them out, mask
out the bits I care about,

00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:53.600
then do it for the
even guys separately.

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:54.470
So it's a bit messy.

00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:58.700
But hand-wavy proof you can
compute the hash function

00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:00.230
of each of these
guys individually,

00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:02.100
but in constant time.

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:03.260
So that lets me do this.

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:04.640
You have to then
check for collisions,

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:05.723
which is kind of annoying.

00:20:05.723 --> 00:20:06.900
Let's not worry about that.

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:08.750
Set this really high,
very high probability,

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:11.900
there will be no collisions.

00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:13.640
Cool.

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:17.319
So at this point we have
mucked up all the digits.

00:20:17.319 --> 00:20:18.860
The annoying thing
about this hashing

00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:20.450
is we do not preserve order.

00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:26.840
It's a little weird for
a sorting algorithm not

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:28.670
preserve order.

00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:31.850
The whole point is to
put things in order.

00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:34.370
But it's going to be
useful nonetheless.

00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:36.740
And so each digit
has been mangled.

00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:38.570
Each digit is out of order.

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:40.910
But of course, the
sequence of digits

00:20:40.910 --> 00:20:45.800
has been preserved,
in some sense

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:47.730
So, what?

00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:50.300
Well, at this point
we can use packed

00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:52.640
sorting to sort what remains.

00:21:05.836 --> 00:21:08.670
In general packed
sorting can sort n

00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:13.680
b bit integers provided
b is small, so w

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:18.500
is at least b log n log log n.

00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:21.900
That's the theorem
of packed sorting.

00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:25.080
We're going to delay the
coverage of this result

00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:26.330
until later.

00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:36.830
And I claim that that applies
here because each chunk is now

00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:39.290
order log n bits.

00:21:39.290 --> 00:21:43.200
And there's log to
the epsilon n bits.

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:51.320
So b is theta log to
the 1 plus epsilon n.

00:21:51.320 --> 00:22:01.890
And w is at least log to the 2
plus epsilon times log log n.

00:22:01.890 --> 00:22:04.670
OK, so the ratio between
these is as needed.

00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:06.844
It's at least log
n times log log n.

00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:11.220
OK, so that's why this is good.

00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:13.250
There were these things
were huge before.

00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:15.330
We've compressed them a lot.

00:22:15.330 --> 00:22:18.560
They're at least log square,
now they're only log.

00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:21.265
And so now we can
apply packed sorting.

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:28.460
You can fit log times log
log items into one word.

00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:30.680
And that's going to make
sorting easy, somehow.

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:32.660
That's to be done.

00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:36.800
But now the question is,
suppose we had packed sorting,

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:37.760
how does this help you?

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:40.460
Because this does not sort
the original integers.

00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:42.290
It sorts these
integers that have

00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:45.140
all of their digits
permuted in some random way.

00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:49.070
We have no idea how the hash
function re-orders things.

00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:51.977
So we're not done
with signature sort.

00:22:51.977 --> 00:22:54.560
It's called signature sort, of
course, because of the hashing.

00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:57.390
You're taking signatures
of each of these digits.

00:22:57.390 --> 00:22:59.690
Another word for hashes.

00:22:59.690 --> 00:23:05.955
All right, next step is to
build a compressed trie.

00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:11.060
This is a term we
haven't used yet.

00:23:17.005 --> 00:23:18.380
So I'm going to
call these things

00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:21.890
that we sorted signatures.

00:23:21.890 --> 00:23:26.960
And how many people know
what a compressed trie is?

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:27.820
OK, no one.

00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:28.869
Wow, just a few.

00:23:28.869 --> 00:23:30.410
So you haven't seen
suffix trees yet.

00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:32.930
We're going to cover where
compressed tries come

00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:34.490
from in a couple
of lectures but we

00:23:34.490 --> 00:23:38.480
get to see them a little early
because they're cool and needed

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:41.640
in this algorithm.

00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:44.230
So first notion is
the notion of a trie.

00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:49.340
The word trie comes
from retrieval,

00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:51.870
from old days when
information retrieval was

00:23:51.870 --> 00:23:56.640
what's now called web
searching, or whatever.

00:23:56.640 --> 00:24:00.410
So it's now pronounced trie.

00:24:00.410 --> 00:24:02.630
It's just another word
for tree, but where

00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:06.530
the children of the tree
come from a fixed universe.

00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:13.285
We've been working
with tries all the time

00:24:13.285 --> 00:24:16.990
in pretty much every lecture
for the last n lectures,

00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:19.620
last w lectures, I don't
know, a lot of them.

00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:21.790
We said oh, OK, well
let's just consider

00:24:21.790 --> 00:24:24.261
the space of all possible keys.

00:24:24.261 --> 00:24:26.260
You know, I've drawn this
picture zillion times.

00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:28.630
Even when we weren't doing
Van Emde Boas, which actually

00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:30.970
stores all of these
things, we were

00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:32.740
thinking about fusion
trees like, oh yeah,

00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:34.690
so we're storing
this value, and we're

00:24:34.690 --> 00:24:37.660
storing this value,
and maybe this value.

00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:40.080
And we understand this
corresponds to a 0-bit.

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:41.250
These are 0 and 1 bits.

00:24:41.250 --> 00:24:43.560
This is a 1, 0, 1, whatever.

00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:47.030
So we understand how to convert
a bit string into this picture.

00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:49.750
This is what we
call a binary trie.

00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:51.560
I want to do the
same thing over here,

00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:53.350
except it's not a binary trie.

00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:56.320
Now each digit is giant
so we're going to have

00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:58.570
some huge branching factor.

00:24:58.570 --> 00:25:00.610
So it's going to be
more like a b-tree.

00:25:00.610 --> 00:25:03.280
The first node has a
whole bunch of children.

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:04.540
I'm not going to even--

00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:11.060
I mean, it's 2 to the w divided
by log to the epsilon n.

00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:13.440
That's the branching factor.

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:15.430
OK, it's big.

00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:19.570
That's the number of possible
values in the first digit.

00:25:19.570 --> 00:25:20.860
OK.

00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:27.190
So then maybe this child
has some node there.

00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:29.410
And maybe this one.

00:25:34.130 --> 00:25:37.205
Actually, sorry, I didn't
want to draw it that way.

00:25:37.205 --> 00:25:40.450
I have a specific trie
in mind, or part of it.

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:52.545
OK, I mean, trie is going
to look something like this.

00:25:52.545 --> 00:25:55.780
It's harder to draw, but
it's the larger than binary

00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:57.570
equivalent of this picture.

00:25:57.570 --> 00:26:01.370
This would be a trie.

00:26:01.370 --> 00:26:03.730
So let's think about a
particular situation.

00:26:03.730 --> 00:26:08.780
Which is, suppose we just have
two items in this structure.

00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:10.310
Then it's easier to draw.

00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:14.350
So let's suppose there's
some item over here, x1.

00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:16.510
There's some item over here, x2.

00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:19.402
Now, generic picture is they
share some common prefix.

00:26:19.402 --> 00:26:20.485
This is the common prefix.

00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:26.425
It's just to understand some
particular picture here.

00:26:26.425 --> 00:26:29.050
Then they diverge, and you know,
then they have their own digit

00:26:29.050 --> 00:26:30.034
values.

00:26:30.034 --> 00:26:32.200
In some sense, this is the
digit value we care about

00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:34.450
because it distinguishes them.

00:26:34.450 --> 00:26:39.850
So there's this idea of a
compressed trie, which cleans

00:26:39.850 --> 00:26:41.170
up this picture a little bit.

00:26:44.772 --> 00:26:46.730
The idea with the compress
trie is very simple.

00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:48.050
You draw this trie.

00:26:48.050 --> 00:26:53.350
So here, imagine I'm erasing all
the things that do not appear.

00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:55.220
Maybe all this is gone.

00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:57.530
So I'm just keeping this
part of the structure.

00:26:57.530 --> 00:27:00.140
Let's do it for the
binary case first.

00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:02.790
The idea in a compress
trie is very simple.

00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:10.619
I'm going to contract
every non-branching node

00:27:10.619 --> 00:27:11.285
into its parent.

00:27:21.930 --> 00:27:23.340
So what that means.

00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:28.950
So here I'm storing three
values: 0, 0, 1, 1; 0, 1,

00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:34.370
0, 0; and 0, 1, 1, 1.

00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:36.680
So some nodes are
non-branching, that's

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:39.605
this node, this
node, and this node.

00:27:39.605 --> 00:27:41.480
And the point is well,
why store those nodes?

00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:43.938
I mean, there was nothing being
distinguished at that node,

00:27:43.938 --> 00:27:45.380
so contract it.

00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:52.510
So the new picture if I
redrew this would be 0, 0, 1--

00:27:52.510 --> 00:27:55.010
sorry, also this
is non-branching.

00:27:55.010 --> 00:27:58.537
So in fact, I'm going
to contract this

00:27:58.537 --> 00:28:00.120
into its parent,
this into its parent.

00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:01.950
So this whole path,
this non-branching path

00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:06.140
will be left with a single edge
which I will label 0, 1, 1.

00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:08.570
But it's a single edge
in this structure.

00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:14.090
Over here we have an edge 1,
and now we have 0, 0 here,

00:28:14.090 --> 00:28:16.640
and 1, 1 here.

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:18.650
That is the compressed
trie representation

00:28:18.650 --> 00:28:20.660
of these three values.

00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:22.610
The nice thing
about this structure

00:28:22.610 --> 00:28:25.580
is every node is branching
except the leaves, which

00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:27.050
means the number
of nodes here is

00:28:27.050 --> 00:28:29.230
linear in the number of leaves.

00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:32.960
That's like twice the number
of leaves minus 1, roughly.

00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:35.930
I guess the root might
not be branching.

00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:37.510
It has no parent
to contract into.

00:28:37.510 --> 00:28:38.660
Whatever.

00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:41.612
But more and more
nodes, most 2n nodes.

00:28:41.612 --> 00:28:42.570
That's the binary case.

00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:47.010
Now over here what we do is in
the corresponding contracted

00:28:47.010 --> 00:28:49.180
try a picture of this thing.

00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:50.915
Let's see, it's a second edge.

00:28:50.915 --> 00:28:53.990
I'm going to put just a label
of 2 on this edge to say, well,

00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:54.950
I'm skipping this node.

00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:56.210
This guy is non-branching.

00:28:56.210 --> 00:28:59.840
So I want to get rid of it and
contract it into the parent.

00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:02.510
So now this corresponds
to two edges here.

00:29:02.510 --> 00:29:04.820
There are two digits, which
I could write the digits

00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:05.690
if I knew what they were.

00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:07.731
But particularly I want
to keep track of the fact

00:29:07.731 --> 00:29:11.100
that there exactly two of them.

00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:12.740
And then there's
a branching node.

00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:14.450
That one stays.

00:29:14.450 --> 00:29:17.040
But then I actually we'll go
straight to the leaves here.

00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:22.360
This will be x1 and x2.

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:24.265
And this will have
a lot of digits.

00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:29.000
OK, so some large
number written here.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.810
So that's the idea
with a compress trie.

00:29:31.810 --> 00:29:34.030
Now the nice thing
about a compress trie

00:29:34.030 --> 00:29:40.000
is they have linear size,
number of edges and vertices

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.220
is linear in the
number of leaves,

00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:45.760
which is the number of
values we have here.

00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:47.440
Another nice thing
about compress tries

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:49.060
is they preserve order.

00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:50.830
So if you look at the
order of the leaves

00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:54.287
down here it's the same as the
order of the leaves over here.

00:29:54.287 --> 00:29:55.870
We're not really
changing order, we're

00:29:55.870 --> 00:29:59.620
just making things a little
shorter to write down.

00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:00.820
Same thing over here.

00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:02.500
I mean, x1 appears
the left of x2.

00:30:18.130 --> 00:30:20.992
Say the order of the
leaves is preserved.

00:30:20.992 --> 00:30:22.700
The other cool thing
about compress tries

00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:25.120
is you can compute
them in linear time.

00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:28.360
But let me tell you why
we're drawing this picture.

00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:32.320
We've messed up all these
chunks, all these digits.

00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:34.730
What does that correspond
to in this picture?

00:30:34.730 --> 00:30:37.661
We've permuted all of the
children in this node.

00:30:37.661 --> 00:30:39.910
We've permuted all the
children in this node, permuted

00:30:39.910 --> 00:30:41.320
all the children in this node.

00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:44.020
But otherwise, the structure
of the tree is correct.

00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:46.000
What we wanted to
do was compute--

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.610
if we could compute the
compress trie representation

00:30:48.610 --> 00:30:53.020
of the original values just
having broken the integers

00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:55.919
into these pieces, then if we
had that trie we could just

00:30:55.919 --> 00:30:58.210
do an in order traversal,
find the order of the leaves,

00:30:58.210 --> 00:31:01.720
then we'd have the sorted
order of the integers.

00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:05.590
Instead what we've computed
is we didn't compute

00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:06.850
the correct compress trie.

00:31:06.850 --> 00:31:08.350
But we computed a
different compress

00:31:08.350 --> 00:31:12.220
trie where every node has
its children permuted.

00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:15.340
So all we need to do is put
the children within each node

00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:17.860
in the correct
order, then we would

00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:20.220
have the correct compress trie.

00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:22.490
OK, that's why we're doing this.

00:31:22.490 --> 00:31:27.400
But first, how do we compute a
compress trie in linear time?

00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:33.950
This is a simple
amortization argument.

00:31:48.887 --> 00:31:49.970
Remember what we're given.

00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:57.070
At this point we are given
the leaves in sorted order.

00:31:57.070 --> 00:31:59.870
We've just sorted our things
so all I'm trying to do

00:31:59.870 --> 00:32:02.970
is compute the trie of the
stuff above the things.

00:32:02.970 --> 00:32:06.406
OK, we're given the leaves of
the trie in the correct order.

00:32:06.406 --> 00:32:08.030
I just need to build
the compress trie.

00:32:08.030 --> 00:32:09.260
The reason I'm building
a compress trie

00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:10.635
is so I can do it
in linear time.

00:32:10.635 --> 00:32:15.780
Constructing the uncompressed
trie would take too long.

00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:17.690
OK, so how do we do this?

00:32:26.150 --> 00:32:29.030
We have our items xn in order.

00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:41.570
I want to just insert it
into the compress trie.

00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:45.080
So I start with an
empty compress trie.

00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:47.840
First thing I do is add x1,
so it's just a single leaf.

00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:50.210
Then I add x2 to the
trie, x3 to the trie.

00:32:50.210 --> 00:32:53.030
In general, I'll have computed--

00:32:53.030 --> 00:32:54.760
I'm going to draw a picture.

00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:58.060
How to draw a partial
trie, something like this.

00:32:58.060 --> 00:33:00.240
I've computed the left
part of trie already.

00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:03.080
All these x1's have been done.

00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:05.780
And now I need to
add on the next,

00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:09.930
say xi over here somewhere.

00:33:09.930 --> 00:33:12.860
So think of how that
would look in the trie.

00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:15.715
It has to come off
of the right side,

00:33:15.715 --> 00:33:17.090
I guess what would
you call this?

00:33:17.090 --> 00:33:19.550
The right spine of the tree.

00:33:19.550 --> 00:33:22.310
Some right most node over here.

00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:27.140
We want xi to be a new
to the right child.

00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:30.890
So one possible
picture is there was

00:33:30.890 --> 00:33:33.830
some node which had
some other children,

00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:37.100
maybe this one had xi minus 1.

00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:39.160
Maybe xi belongs over here.

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:43.700
Maybe this leads to xi
in the uncompressed trie.

00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:46.110
This could be a
potential picture.

00:33:46.110 --> 00:33:49.310
In the compress trie
this node either exists

00:33:49.310 --> 00:33:50.960
or got contracted.

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:55.250
If it exists maybe there
was a previous xi minus 2

00:33:55.250 --> 00:33:56.464
belongs over here.

00:33:56.464 --> 00:33:58.880
So we already had this node
because it distinguished these

00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:01.410
two xj's.

00:34:01.410 --> 00:34:03.000
To add the xi is really easy.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:07.820
I just add a node here and then
which points to a leaf of xi.

00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:10.760
So that could be one situation.

00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:13.480
The other situation is only
slightly more complicated.

00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:25.550
So the other
possibility is this node

00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:28.730
didn't exist in the compressed
trie, which means we jumped

00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:32.909
over it in the compress trie.

00:34:32.909 --> 00:34:35.210
Some number bigger
than 1 here, maybe you

00:34:35.210 --> 00:34:39.120
skipped three nodes, who knows.

00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:40.451
So now this node matters.

00:34:40.451 --> 00:34:41.450
It didn't matter before.

00:34:41.450 --> 00:34:44.570
Before it was non-branching, but
now we add xi, it's branching.

00:34:44.570 --> 00:34:48.909
All we do is update,
add this new guy,

00:34:48.909 --> 00:34:52.389
add the new pointer to xi.

00:34:52.389 --> 00:34:54.949
OK, so constant work.

00:34:54.949 --> 00:34:59.780
Great, constant work per xi
inserted, linear time overall.

00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:00.920
Not really.

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:02.510
I've cheated a little
bit here, which

00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:05.780
is how do we know what we're
going to do this operation.

00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:08.930
So the changes we make
is constant, that's fine.

00:35:08.930 --> 00:35:11.120
But how did I find that
this was the edge where

00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:13.100
I need to put xi in?

00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:14.990
You can't do it
in constant time,

00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:17.840
but we can do it in
constant amortized time.

00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:22.700
So what we're going to do
is start at the right most--

00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:26.690
that is not very red.

00:35:26.690 --> 00:35:29.965
Not a red chalk.

00:35:29.965 --> 00:35:32.210
Red chalk.

00:35:32.210 --> 00:35:35.630
We start at this leaf, the
rightmost leaf which you go

00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:37.380
going right most as possible.

00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:42.090
We're going to walk up the tree
until we find the right point.

00:35:42.090 --> 00:35:45.340
We're going to spend
linear time this path walk.

00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:47.532
OK, how could this
possibly be OK?

00:35:47.532 --> 00:35:49.990
I think you believe that I can
do it in linear time, right.

00:35:49.990 --> 00:35:51.870
Each point I see--

00:35:51.870 --> 00:35:53.660
what is my common prefix?

00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:55.470
Actually an easy way
is right up front.

00:35:55.470 --> 00:35:59.510
This thing right
here is xi minus 1.

00:35:59.510 --> 00:36:00.830
These are single integers.

00:36:00.830 --> 00:36:04.070
So I can just compute
their x or, find

00:36:04.070 --> 00:36:06.560
the most significant one bit,
which we did with the fusion

00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:08.180
tree lecture.

00:36:08.180 --> 00:36:12.890
And boom, I know where they
differ in bit position.

00:36:12.890 --> 00:36:14.630
By some rounding
I can figure out

00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:19.070
which chunk they differ
in, just by dividing,

00:36:19.070 --> 00:36:19.880
taking the ceiling.

00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:26.180
So I know the correct depth.

00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:30.170
And then these numbers tell
me how much depth I'm losing.

00:36:30.170 --> 00:36:32.480
As I walk up at some
point I'll discover,

00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:34.160
oops, I just jumped
over the depth

00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:36.120
I care about where they differ.

00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:38.480
And so at that point I
know to do that operation.

00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:43.280
So if there are k edges
here on the compress trie,

00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:48.390
I can do this in order k
time, k plus 1, let's say.

00:36:48.390 --> 00:36:50.090
Why is that OK?

00:36:50.090 --> 00:36:55.190
Because my potential
function, amortization

00:36:55.190 --> 00:37:03.045
is going to be the length
of the rightmost path.

00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:10.020
OK, before my rightmost
path was this thing.

00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:13.350
Afterwards, my rightmost path
is going to be this thing.

00:37:13.350 --> 00:37:17.270
So it got roughly k
shorter, k minus 1 shorter.

00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:19.710
OK, so I charged
this k plus 1 cost

00:37:19.710 --> 00:37:24.850
to a potential
decrease of k minus 1.

00:37:24.850 --> 00:37:28.250
And so the amortize
cost is only constant.

00:37:28.250 --> 00:37:29.670
Easy amortization.

00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:31.620
Another way to see
this is, overall

00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:34.050
we're basically doing it in
order traversal of the tree.

00:37:34.050 --> 00:37:37.080
So whenever we walk up we'll
never visit these nodes again,

00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:39.112
because then we go down
at a different place.

00:37:39.112 --> 00:37:41.070
OK, yeah, this guy we're
going to walk up again

00:37:41.070 --> 00:37:43.195
because in an in order
traversal we would have gone

00:37:43.195 --> 00:37:45.270
left and then come back
to it and then gone down.

00:37:45.270 --> 00:37:46.686
So overall we're
doing an in order

00:37:46.686 --> 00:37:51.140
traversal of the compress trie,
so it's linear time total.

00:37:56.271 --> 00:37:56.770
OK.

00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:02.084
Still not done though.

00:38:02.084 --> 00:38:03.750
What we have so far--
what have we done?

00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:06.450
We've taken our numbers,
we've split them into digits.

00:38:06.450 --> 00:38:09.870
We randomly permuted the
digits via hash function.

00:38:09.870 --> 00:38:12.660
That magically let us
sort them in linear time.

00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:15.900
Now we've built a compress
trie of that representation.

00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:19.290
The last thing to do is to
fix the order of the children

00:38:19.290 --> 00:38:20.760
from each node.

00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:23.130
The tree is correct
except for the order

00:38:23.130 --> 00:38:25.170
of the children in each node.

00:38:25.170 --> 00:38:30.060
So we've kind of sorted a little
bit, but haven't fully sorted.

00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:34.760
So that's the last step.

00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:39.320
And we're going to do
that with recursion.

00:38:43.430 --> 00:38:45.725
We're only going to recurse
a constant number of times.

00:38:48.410 --> 00:38:49.550
Recursively sort.

00:39:20.970 --> 00:39:24.890
OK, I'm going to walk
through this compress

00:39:24.890 --> 00:39:29.450
try trie we've built. And I
guess it looks more like this.

00:39:29.450 --> 00:39:33.877
And for each edge I'm going
to write down this key.

00:39:33.877 --> 00:39:35.460
First thing you're
going to write down

00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:36.720
is the ID of the node.

00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:42.260
Let's say the ID is the in order
traversal index of the node.

00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:43.380
OK, so boom.

00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:47.910
As we traverse the tree we can
just increment this counter.

00:39:47.910 --> 00:39:51.390
Then we also want--

00:39:51.390 --> 00:39:57.960
what I'm going to put in here
is the actual chunk value

00:39:57.960 --> 00:39:59.940
that's at the top of the node.

00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:02.700
So something like this,
or I guess this one.

00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:05.400
This one consists
of two chunk values.

00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:09.352
So it's called c1, for
chunk values, c1 and c2.

00:40:09.352 --> 00:40:11.310
It's the first chunk
value and the second chunk

00:40:11.310 --> 00:40:13.451
value, first digit
and the second digit.

00:40:13.451 --> 00:40:14.700
Just write down the first one.

00:40:18.062 --> 00:40:19.770
That's really the only
one we care about.

00:40:19.770 --> 00:40:21.936
The second one wasn't
branching so it's no big deal.

00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:26.240
OK, so there's some chunk value.

00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:30.380
Now, I don't want to write
down the signature chunk value.

00:40:30.380 --> 00:40:32.180
I don't want to write
down the hash value.

00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:37.040
I want the actual chunk,
original chunk not the hash.

00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:39.590
That's why I write
actual over here

00:40:39.590 --> 00:40:41.480
and then also, I'm
going to write down

00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:42.780
the index of the edge.

00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:46.240
So this is the second
edge, for example.

00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:49.560
OK, now this is in some
sense the wrong index.

00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:52.190
And what I want to compute
is where it's supposed to be.

00:40:52.190 --> 00:40:54.050
The edges have been permuted.

00:40:54.050 --> 00:40:56.090
So if I sort this
thing, I claim that I'll

00:40:56.090 --> 00:41:00.390
find that all the
desired permutations.

00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:02.060
OK, why?

00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:07.280
Because if I sort by
this triple, first thing

00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:10.760
I sort by is by node ID, then
I'm sorting by actual chunk

00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:12.119
value, then edge index.

00:41:12.119 --> 00:41:13.910
I don't care that I'm
sorting by it, that's

00:41:13.910 --> 00:41:15.870
just coming along for the ride.

00:41:15.870 --> 00:41:20.270
So what this tells
me is for each node

00:41:20.270 --> 00:41:23.150
it gives me the sorted value
of the actual chunks, not

00:41:23.150 --> 00:41:24.560
the hash chunks.

00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:28.160
And then it tells me the
order they used to be in.

00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:33.200
So this is a way to figure
out the sorted permutation

00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:34.250
of these things.

00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:35.954
This gives you the old index.

00:41:35.954 --> 00:41:37.370
And so once you've
sorted them you

00:41:37.370 --> 00:41:41.510
know that new correct
order is in order by chunk.

00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:43.040
And so this gives
you the inverse

00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:47.420
of the permutation over here,
of where each edge should be.

00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:52.670
So once I've done
this the last step is

00:41:52.670 --> 00:42:04.340
for each node permute
the edges as given

00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:07.190
by this inverse permutation.

00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:08.118
Questions?

00:42:08.118 --> 00:42:09.659
AUDIENCE: Can you
explain again that?

00:42:09.659 --> 00:42:11.330
You were basically
sorting three times.

00:42:11.330 --> 00:42:14.756
ERIK DEMAINE: No, I'm sorting
these single key values.

00:42:14.756 --> 00:42:16.880
The key value, the most
significant part of the key

00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:17.780
is this.

00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:19.340
The next most significant
part of the key is this.

00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:21.360
And the least significant
part of the key is this.

00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:23.276
So imagine concatenating
these things together

00:42:23.276 --> 00:42:24.400
into a single key value.

00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:26.540
Yeah, good question.

00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:29.270
What I'll talk about in a
moment, how big this key is.

00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:32.390
But if I sort by the
concatenation of those keys

00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:34.460
then what happens is
I'm sorting by this

00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:35.632
and then sorting by this.

00:42:35.632 --> 00:42:37.340
But really, I'm doing
one sort operation.

00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:39.620
This is one recursion.

00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:42.530
Other questions?

00:42:42.530 --> 00:42:44.200
OK.

00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:46.520
Do you see why this
gives us what we need?

00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:49.500
For every node we want
to sort all those chunks.

00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:51.806
And so this information
is just so we

00:42:51.806 --> 00:42:53.180
can keep track of
the permutation

00:42:53.180 --> 00:42:54.920
when we're just sorting
by value and not

00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:56.500
keeping the permutation.

00:42:56.500 --> 00:42:58.650
This let's us keep track of it.

00:42:58.650 --> 00:43:01.760
But our real goal is to
sort all the chunk values.

00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:04.430
And we add in the node
ID so that we just

00:43:04.430 --> 00:43:06.740
learn for every node what
we're supposed to do instead

00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:08.712
of globally what we need to do.

00:43:08.712 --> 00:43:10.670
Maybe you don't have to
do this but it's easier

00:43:10.670 --> 00:43:13.010
to keep the node ID in there.

00:43:13.010 --> 00:43:17.004
OK, how many bits
are in this key?

00:43:17.004 --> 00:43:18.920
So our whole point was
to make chunks small so

00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:20.169
that the keys were small.

00:43:20.169 --> 00:43:22.460
But I claim this will be a
little bit smaller than what

00:43:22.460 --> 00:43:23.730
we started with.

00:43:23.730 --> 00:43:26.300
So the node ID, well,
there's only n nodes,

00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:29.510
so this is log n bits.

00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:35.090
Chunk value is, I
guess, w divided by log

00:43:35.090 --> 00:43:38.630
to the epsilon n bits.

00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:42.070
Because there are a log
to the epsilon n chunks,

00:43:42.070 --> 00:43:44.240
so it's w divided by
log to the epsilon bits.

00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:50.390
The edge index, how many
different things were there?

00:43:54.822 --> 00:43:57.090
Is it also w divided
by log to the epsilon?

00:43:57.090 --> 00:43:59.524
I guess so.

00:43:59.524 --> 00:44:00.440
Depends how you count.

00:44:04.390 --> 00:44:06.800
Let me think for a second
how these edge indices should

00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:07.300
be stored.

00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:14.540
I think I'd like to
store the edge indices--

00:44:14.540 --> 00:44:20.150
I don't want to store
the absent down pointers.

00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:23.680
The way that I built this
tree, this compress trie,

00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:25.920
I was always adding
things to the right.

00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:28.554
So it's like OK,
I'm storing here.

00:44:28.554 --> 00:44:30.470
Here's the first child,
here's the next child,

00:44:30.470 --> 00:44:32.344
here's the next child,
here's the next child.

00:44:32.344 --> 00:44:33.450
I just keep appending on.

00:44:33.450 --> 00:44:35.570
It's like an array that you
can grow to the right, which

00:44:35.570 --> 00:44:37.460
you should know how to
do in constant time,

00:44:37.460 --> 00:44:39.168
even though linked
list is probably fine.

00:44:41.342 --> 00:44:42.800
If there are a
bunch of values here

00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:44.258
that are just null
pointers I don't

00:44:44.258 --> 00:44:46.470
want to store those
items in the array.

00:44:46.470 --> 00:44:50.360
So in fact, the maximum number
of children of a node is n.

00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:53.190
I mean, at the worst case you
have branching everywhere.

00:44:53.190 --> 00:45:03.050
So this is only log n bits to
store the index in that array.

00:45:03.050 --> 00:45:05.240
So it's an extra
level of compression.

00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:13.150
I guess I didn't mention
don't store null pointers,

00:45:13.150 --> 00:45:16.040
just skip them.

00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:19.510
And that's easy to do because
you're always just appending.

00:45:19.510 --> 00:45:24.300
And in the end what
do I need to do here?

00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:33.010
Step seven is in order
traversal of the compress trie.

00:45:37.180 --> 00:45:43.654
And I output all the
leaves I get in order.

00:45:43.654 --> 00:45:45.820
And the point is we computed
the compress trie which

00:45:45.820 --> 00:45:48.910
has the rough correct
topological structure.

00:45:48.910 --> 00:45:50.710
Then we fix the order
within each node,

00:45:50.710 --> 00:45:53.320
now we have the correctly
sorted compress trie.

00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:55.980
And so you're just doing
in order traversal, output

00:45:55.980 --> 00:45:57.610
the leave you get in order.

00:45:57.610 --> 00:46:00.690
Boom, we've sorted
all the items.

00:46:00.690 --> 00:46:01.315
A little crazy.

00:46:03.887 --> 00:46:06.220
So if all we need to do in
the end is in order traversal

00:46:06.220 --> 00:46:08.553
then it's fine we don't need
to store the null pointers.

00:46:08.553 --> 00:46:10.920
So we don't need to be able
to search in this trie,

00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:11.710
so this is enough.

00:46:14.590 --> 00:46:16.090
Clear?

00:46:16.090 --> 00:46:17.950
OK, the remaining
question is how

00:46:17.950 --> 00:46:19.970
expensive is this recursion?

00:46:19.970 --> 00:46:23.170
So I computed the number
of bits basically w

00:46:23.170 --> 00:46:27.020
divided by log to the
epsilon n, plus order log n.

00:46:27.020 --> 00:46:29.050
That order log n won't hurt us.

00:46:29.050 --> 00:46:32.660
Now, we started with
integers of size w,

00:46:32.660 --> 00:46:35.740
the total size here was w.

00:46:35.740 --> 00:46:39.850
Now we have integers that
their size is w divided

00:46:39.850 --> 00:46:40.910
by log to the epsilon n.

00:46:40.910 --> 00:46:41.868
So we've made progress.

00:46:45.010 --> 00:46:46.520
Cool.

00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:47.645
How much progress?

00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:54.210
Over here maybe.

00:47:01.710 --> 00:47:05.280
After, let's say, 1
over epsilon plus 1

00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:17.230
recursions we will
have reached b will

00:47:17.230 --> 00:47:27.110
have decreased to order log n.

00:47:27.110 --> 00:47:36.350
I guess, like 1 over epsilon
log n plus w over log

00:47:36.350 --> 00:47:39.800
to the 1 plus epsilon n.

00:47:47.480 --> 00:47:48.940
OK.

00:47:48.940 --> 00:47:50.850
Right, if we take
w and every time we

00:47:50.850 --> 00:47:54.630
divide by log to the epsilon n,
then after 1 over epsilon times

00:47:54.630 --> 00:47:57.700
we have divided by log
n, get rid of epsilon.

00:47:57.700 --> 00:47:59.910
Do it one more time,
we get w divided

00:47:59.910 --> 00:48:03.480
by log to the 1 plus epsilon n.

00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:05.720
And at this point
we're in good shape.

00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:11.700
If we get the size
of our integers

00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:15.360
to be only w divided by log
to the 1 plus epsilon n,

00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:18.450
then we can use packed sorting.

00:48:18.450 --> 00:48:20.310
Because packed sorting,
conveniently it's

00:48:20.310 --> 00:48:22.410
the black box at the
moment, says well,

00:48:22.410 --> 00:48:25.710
as long as w divided by b is
a little bigger than log n.

00:48:25.710 --> 00:48:28.260
So here we've made it quite
a bit bigger than log n.

00:48:28.260 --> 00:48:31.560
I mean, log to the 1
plus epsilon n bigger,

00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:33.270
then we can use packed sorting.

00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:44.550
Reach base case, and
then use packed sorting.

00:48:50.740 --> 00:48:53.210
OK, the only thing is
there's this log n.

00:48:53.210 --> 00:48:56.890
Now, epsilon is a constant here,
so 1 over epsilon is constant.

00:48:56.890 --> 00:48:58.740
So this is just order log n.

00:48:58.740 --> 00:49:00.280
Order log n doesn't hurt you.

00:49:00.280 --> 00:49:03.030
I mean, if this happened
to dominate this

00:49:03.030 --> 00:49:06.300
then you're saying your values
are order log n bits long,

00:49:06.300 --> 00:49:08.740
and so you use radex sort.

00:49:08.740 --> 00:49:10.612
So that's not going to dominate.

00:49:10.612 --> 00:49:12.070
In fact, you can
prove in this case

00:49:12.070 --> 00:49:14.528
it's not going to dominate. w
is at least log to the 2 plus

00:49:14.528 --> 00:49:15.500
epsilon.

00:49:15.500 --> 00:49:17.190
So you take w
divided by log to 1

00:49:17.190 --> 00:49:20.010
plus epsilon, that's
still at least log n.

00:49:20.010 --> 00:49:21.600
So this will always dominate.

00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:31.500
OK, so we did all
this work and all

00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:35.142
we did was reduce our word size
by a log to the epsilon factor.

00:49:35.142 --> 00:49:36.600
But that's enough,
because after we

00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:40.310
do that 1 over
epsilon plus 1 times

00:49:40.310 --> 00:49:42.990
the words are small enough,
or the items we're sorting

00:49:42.990 --> 00:49:45.750
are small enough, that we
can use packed sorting.

00:49:45.750 --> 00:49:47.700
And boom, we're done.

00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:52.140
OK, that is the beauty
of signature sort.

00:49:52.140 --> 00:49:54.780
Any questions about that?

00:49:54.780 --> 00:49:56.070
Definitely not easy.

00:49:59.020 --> 00:50:01.640
But, it works.

00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:04.594
The crazy idea is, well,
decompose into these digits.

00:50:04.594 --> 00:50:06.760
And when we decompose into
log to the epsilon digits

00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:08.270
because that would be enough.

00:50:08.270 --> 00:50:10.270
If we can get things down
to a single digit life

00:50:10.270 --> 00:50:12.460
would be easy.

00:50:12.460 --> 00:50:16.550
Which I guess is kind of
like Van Emde Boas, right.

00:50:16.550 --> 00:50:18.790
It's like our lower
bounds from last time.

00:50:18.790 --> 00:50:19.900
I don't know.

00:50:19.900 --> 00:50:22.960
If we can make it to only
one digit mattered then

00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:25.750
we could afford to do it because
each digit is quite a bit

00:50:25.750 --> 00:50:26.290
smaller.

00:50:26.290 --> 00:50:30.790
It's smaller by a factor
of log to the epsilon n.

00:50:30.790 --> 00:50:32.700
So we did that
splitting and then there

00:50:32.700 --> 00:50:36.200
was this observation that
most digit values aren't used.

00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:39.520
So if we hash then
things got a lot smaller.

00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:41.260
Then we can afford to pack sort.

00:50:41.260 --> 00:50:43.455
Except that hash didn't
preserve the order.

00:50:43.455 --> 00:50:44.830
How didn't it
preserve the order?

00:50:44.830 --> 00:50:46.660
Well, when you look
at the compress trie

00:50:46.660 --> 00:50:48.430
you see how it got messed up.

00:50:48.430 --> 00:50:50.210
Each node got messed
up individually,

00:50:50.210 --> 00:50:52.535
but overall the structure
of the trie was correct.

00:50:52.535 --> 00:50:54.910
So we did all this work to
get the structure of the trie.

00:50:54.910 --> 00:50:56.950
Then we had to fix
the node order.

00:50:56.950 --> 00:50:59.080
But that's really just
sorting a single digit.

00:50:59.080 --> 00:51:01.900
And yeah, we have to do it for
all nodes but you add them up.

00:51:01.900 --> 00:51:05.200
It's still only n items
that we need to sort.

00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:08.500
So I wrote that b went down.

00:51:08.500 --> 00:51:10.515
n stays the same.

00:51:10.515 --> 00:51:12.140
The number of things
we have to sort of

00:51:12.140 --> 00:51:15.375
stays the same, which is fine.

00:51:15.375 --> 00:51:17.190
We're not trying
to reduce n, we're

00:51:17.190 --> 00:51:19.030
just trying to reduce
the size of our items

00:51:19.030 --> 00:51:20.700
to be a little
bit smaller than w

00:51:20.700 --> 00:51:22.770
so then we can use
packed sorting.

00:51:22.770 --> 00:51:26.800
OK, I think I've gone over
this algorithm enough times.

00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:29.320
The next step is packed sorting.

00:51:32.290 --> 00:51:36.940
If we have integers that are
much smaller than our word,

00:51:36.940 --> 00:51:39.360
how do we sort in linear time?

00:51:39.360 --> 00:51:43.140
And this is going to be
essentially a fancy merge sort.

00:52:09.284 --> 00:52:10.575
This is done in the same paper.

00:52:26.560 --> 00:52:30.910
Before we said omega, I'm
going to essentially make omega

00:52:30.910 --> 00:52:32.057
a little bit bigger than 2.

00:52:32.057 --> 00:52:33.640
So I want to assume
that w is at least

00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:36.910
twice b plus 1 log n log log n.

00:52:36.910 --> 00:52:38.860
That's just to make
this convenient,

00:52:38.860 --> 00:52:42.042
but of course it doesn't really
matter what the constants are.

00:52:42.042 --> 00:52:43.750
This will make everything
fit in one word

00:52:43.750 --> 00:52:46.410
though, instead of a
constant number of words.

00:52:46.410 --> 00:53:03.000
OK, step zero of this
algorithm is the packing part.

00:53:07.260 --> 00:53:09.780
We can fit more than one
element into each word.

00:53:09.780 --> 00:53:12.060
So put them in.

00:53:12.060 --> 00:53:13.860
Now, we have linear
time overall.

00:53:13.860 --> 00:53:16.550
This is easy to do.

00:53:16.550 --> 00:53:17.940
You have some word already.

00:53:20.580 --> 00:53:23.940
Take those items, shift them
left or in the next item,

00:53:23.940 --> 00:53:25.530
shift them left or
in the next item,

00:53:25.530 --> 00:53:27.440
shift them left or
in the next item.

00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:30.460
OK, linear time.

00:53:30.460 --> 00:53:33.610
So in the end what it's
going to look like--

00:53:33.610 --> 00:53:36.810
oh, I also want to leave a 0
bit in between each of them.

00:53:36.810 --> 00:53:39.390
So we're going to have b.

00:53:39.390 --> 00:53:53.150
This is going to
be x1 here, x2, xn.

00:53:53.150 --> 00:53:55.171
Each of these is b bits long.

00:53:55.171 --> 00:53:56.420
And then we have one more bit.

00:53:58.940 --> 00:54:00.710
And in fact, the way
we set things up this

00:54:00.710 --> 00:54:02.074
is only half the word.

00:54:02.074 --> 00:54:03.740
So there's another
half over here, which

00:54:03.740 --> 00:54:06.470
is going to be all 0 for now.

00:54:06.470 --> 00:54:08.890
So we have one word contains--

00:54:08.890 --> 00:54:10.680
sorry, this is not n items.

00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:14.929
This is going to
be log n log log n.

00:54:14.929 --> 00:54:16.220
Can't fit them all in one word.

00:54:16.220 --> 00:54:18.194
That would make
life really easy.

00:54:18.194 --> 00:54:20.360
You can fit log n log log
n items in the first word.

00:54:20.360 --> 00:54:22.940
Then the next word
is the next log n

00:54:22.940 --> 00:54:25.260
log log n items and so on.

00:54:25.260 --> 00:54:26.480
Linear time to do that.

00:54:30.170 --> 00:54:33.472
Next step, this is an algorithm.

00:54:33.472 --> 00:54:34.430
It's not really a step.

00:54:34.430 --> 00:54:38.320
I should say these are
things that we're able to do,

00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:41.144
and we're going to combine
them in different ways.

00:54:41.144 --> 00:54:42.560
So the next thing
to observe, this

00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:46.070
is sort of a bottom
up perspective.

00:54:46.070 --> 00:54:48.320
So first thing we can do
is pack things into word.

00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:52.000
Next thing we can do is
merge two sorted words.

00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:55.670
Let's say they each have k items
and k is at most log n log log

00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:56.170
n.

00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:15.575
And I want to merge them into
one sorted word with two k

00:55:15.575 --> 00:55:16.075
elements.

00:55:18.970 --> 00:55:22.060
So I have two of these
things and I'll merge them

00:55:22.060 --> 00:55:25.244
in sorted order.

00:55:25.244 --> 00:55:27.160
And when I did this
packing, nothing's sorted.

00:55:27.160 --> 00:55:29.170
But don't worry about
that at the moment.

00:55:29.170 --> 00:55:31.690
Just if I had two
these words and suppose

00:55:31.690 --> 00:55:34.990
they were already
sorted, then I want

00:55:34.990 --> 00:55:39.610
to merge them and make
them still sorted.

00:55:39.610 --> 00:55:41.860
OK, I want x1 to be
less than x2 and so on.

00:55:44.470 --> 00:55:45.895
How much time?

00:55:45.895 --> 00:55:48.340
It'd be cool if you could
do this in constant time

00:55:48.340 --> 00:55:49.591
on a transdichotomous rem.

00:55:49.591 --> 00:55:51.340
You could do anything
on a constant number

00:55:51.340 --> 00:55:52.532
of words in constant time.

00:55:52.532 --> 00:55:54.240
We're not going to
achieve constant time,

00:55:54.240 --> 00:55:55.880
but we don't need to.

00:55:55.880 --> 00:55:57.960
We're going to do
order log k time.

00:56:01.235 --> 00:56:03.610
ERIK DEMAINE: This is the
hardest step of packed sorting,

00:56:03.610 --> 00:56:06.790
and I'm not going to tell
you how to do it until later.

00:56:06.790 --> 00:56:08.890
I will tell you, don't worry.

00:56:08.890 --> 00:56:13.210
But this is going to
require bitonic sorting.

00:56:13.210 --> 00:56:15.650
So I have to delay
it a little bit.

00:56:15.650 --> 00:56:17.320
Suppose you had that for now.

00:56:17.320 --> 00:56:19.030
Let me tell you how
the rest is easy.

00:56:25.900 --> 00:56:28.860
So many black boxes, but they're
all filled in in this lecture.

00:56:31.660 --> 00:56:37.060
OK, next thing you
might ask is, well,

00:56:37.060 --> 00:56:38.860
how do I get a sorted word?

00:56:38.860 --> 00:56:42.190
I see how to get a single word
that has log n log log n items.

00:56:42.190 --> 00:56:44.640
But how would I
sort those items?

00:56:44.640 --> 00:56:46.360
Use merge sort.

00:56:46.360 --> 00:56:47.410
Here's a merger.

00:56:47.410 --> 00:56:49.599
You have a way to
merge two sorted lists,

00:56:49.599 --> 00:56:51.140
so use merge sort,
that will give you

00:56:51.140 --> 00:56:53.270
a way to sort the whole thing.

00:56:53.270 --> 00:56:58.060
So I'm going to merge sort
k equals log n log log n

00:56:58.060 --> 00:57:06.300
items into one sorted word.

00:57:13.050 --> 00:57:15.690
So I start out with a
word that's unsorted.

00:57:15.690 --> 00:57:17.490
I do merge sort.

00:57:17.490 --> 00:57:19.884
And I sort them.

00:57:19.884 --> 00:57:21.550
So this is not the
whole sorting problem

00:57:21.550 --> 00:57:25.300
but it's the one
word sorting problem.

00:57:25.300 --> 00:57:27.060
So how long does this take?

00:57:27.060 --> 00:57:30.020
Well, it's usual
merge sort recurrence,

00:57:30.020 --> 00:57:34.095
but then it's plus how long
it takes me to split the word.

00:57:34.095 --> 00:57:35.470
Well, splitting
the word is easy,

00:57:35.470 --> 00:57:38.310
you just mask out the
low end or the high end

00:57:38.310 --> 00:57:40.140
and then maybe shift over.

00:57:40.140 --> 00:57:42.900
So in constant time I
can get the left half

00:57:42.900 --> 00:57:46.230
and the right half of the
array, which is the word.

00:57:46.230 --> 00:57:47.850
Then the hard part
is merging them.

00:57:47.850 --> 00:57:54.468
And merging them is 1,
and that takes log k.

00:57:54.468 --> 00:57:57.710
So this is step one.

00:57:57.710 --> 00:57:59.010
That's our merger.

00:57:59.010 --> 00:58:00.560
And so what does this solve to?

00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:03.600
Well, probably easiest to
draw the recursion tree.

00:58:03.600 --> 00:58:05.550
So at the root we pay log k.

00:58:05.550 --> 00:58:13.890
Then we have 2 times log
k over 2, log k over 2.

00:58:16.770 --> 00:58:20.160
So at this level
we're paying log k.

00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:26.280
At this level we're paying
2 log k minus 1, I guess.

00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:30.720
I'm just going to
call this maybe--

00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:33.480
yeah, I do need to do that.

00:58:33.480 --> 00:58:36.030
I mean everything is constant
size so you pay a constant.

00:58:36.030 --> 00:58:39.200
How many leaves are there
at the bottom level?

00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:42.260
k of them.

00:58:42.260 --> 00:58:44.090
OK, so at the root
we're paying log k,

00:58:44.090 --> 00:58:45.750
at the leaves we're paying k.

00:58:45.750 --> 00:58:47.310
This is roughly geometric.

00:58:47.310 --> 00:58:50.540
There's this minus 1,
but it's geometric enough

00:58:50.540 --> 00:58:54.210
and when you add up all these
levels it's dominated by k.

00:58:54.210 --> 00:58:56.872
So this ends up
being order k time.

00:58:59.450 --> 00:59:03.860
The minus 1 here turns
out not to matter much.

00:59:03.860 --> 00:59:04.710
Cool.

00:59:04.710 --> 00:59:08.110
So this linear time sorting
on log n log log n items.

00:59:08.110 --> 00:59:10.050
Everything it fits in a word.

00:59:10.050 --> 00:59:13.060
Cool, but we're not done yet.

00:59:13.060 --> 00:59:16.320
We need another level.

00:59:16.320 --> 00:59:19.455
The rest is pretty easy.

00:59:19.455 --> 00:59:21.010
It's just scaling up.

00:59:54.660 --> 00:59:56.540
OK, let's see.

00:59:56.540 --> 01:00:00.530
At this point we're going to
assume that all of our words

01:00:00.530 --> 01:00:02.150
are completely full.

01:00:02.150 --> 01:00:05.270
So this merging and stuff
was in order to fill up words

01:00:05.270 --> 01:00:07.310
and to make those words sorted.

01:00:07.310 --> 01:00:10.640
But once we've done that
for each cluster of log n

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:13.130
log log n items, now
we can assume each word

01:00:13.130 --> 01:00:14.650
is sorted and completely full.

01:00:14.650 --> 01:00:18.150
It has exactly k elements in it.

01:00:18.150 --> 01:00:25.540
So each of these r sorted
words has k elements.

01:00:25.540 --> 01:00:28.100
OK, so now the issue is
things don't fit in a word.

01:00:28.100 --> 01:00:30.410
And so now suppose they
fit in r sorted words.

01:00:30.410 --> 01:00:35.120
So supposed we've already made
a sorted list of r times k items

01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:38.720
which fit in r words,
each with k items in it.

01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:40.760
Then I want to take
two of these lists

01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:42.590
and merge them
together and get one

01:00:42.590 --> 01:00:44.620
sorted list of sorted words.

01:00:44.620 --> 01:00:50.570
So it's 2 rk items that are
distributed into 2r words,

01:00:50.570 --> 01:00:53.960
each of size k.

01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:57.750
How do I do that
merge in linear time?

01:00:57.750 --> 01:01:03.700
And I only need to do it
in r log k time, only.

01:01:03.700 --> 01:01:04.550
Yeah, question?

01:01:04.550 --> 01:01:08.860
AUDIENCE: I'm assuming k is
the number of items per word?

01:01:08.860 --> 01:01:12.230
ERIK DEMAINE: Yeah, k
is this from now on.

01:01:12.230 --> 01:01:16.129
And there are exactly
k elements per word.

01:01:16.129 --> 01:01:18.170
We've already filled up
the word so at this point

01:01:18.170 --> 01:01:19.320
we can assume that.

01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:21.427
AUDIENCE: But it's exactly
equal, not less than.

01:01:21.427 --> 01:01:22.260
ERIK DEMAINE: Right.

01:01:22.260 --> 01:01:23.132
AUDIENCE: Because in one--

01:01:23.132 --> 01:01:24.830
ERIK DEMAINE: Yeah, over here
it's less than or equal to.

01:01:24.830 --> 01:01:26.121
I know it's a little confusing.

01:01:26.121 --> 01:01:29.280
I use k for different--
call this k prime.

01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:33.080
OK, and at this point we've
filled up to this value of k.

01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:35.570
Now everything has exactly
log n log log n items.

01:01:35.570 --> 01:01:38.120
Thanks.

01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:40.070
OK, let's see.

01:01:42.650 --> 01:01:45.590
A regular merging algorithm
would take r times k time

01:01:45.590 --> 01:01:47.970
because they're r times k items.

01:01:47.970 --> 01:01:51.980
But we have this merger
over here, which will

01:01:51.980 --> 01:01:55.040
merge two words in log k time.

01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:58.250
So that's why it's
going to be r log k.

01:01:58.250 --> 01:01:59.300
What's the picture?

01:01:59.300 --> 01:02:00.450
Well, let me draw it.

01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:21.080
We have a list of words.

01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:24.040
A list of words.

01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:24.880
How do we merge?

01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:27.880
Well, we take the first
two words, merge them.

01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:30.620
When we merge them and we know
how to do this n log k time,

01:02:30.620 --> 01:02:33.220
that's step 1.

01:02:33.220 --> 01:02:34.954
When we merge them
we get two words,

01:02:34.954 --> 01:02:35.995
they just are now sorted.

01:02:39.100 --> 01:02:41.470
So we've got these
two guys sorted

01:02:41.470 --> 01:02:43.510
and then there's the rest.

01:02:43.510 --> 01:02:45.610
I'd like to say output
these and repeat,

01:02:45.610 --> 01:02:48.640
but that wouldn't
be quite correct.

01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:54.979
Well, these guys I can output
because I've got k items here,

01:02:54.979 --> 01:02:55.520
k items here.

01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:57.590
These are the k smallest
among all of them.

01:02:57.590 --> 01:03:00.340
Those must be the
overall smallest k items.

01:03:00.340 --> 01:03:02.050
Because I compared k with k.

01:03:02.050 --> 01:03:04.930
These higher k
items, I don't know.

01:03:04.930 --> 01:03:06.560
They might be good or bad.

01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:11.971
So I have to put this high part
back into one of these lists.

01:03:11.971 --> 01:03:13.720
You have to think a
little bit about which

01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:14.590
list to put it into.

01:03:14.590 --> 01:03:16.690
Turns out if you
look at the max item,

01:03:16.690 --> 01:03:19.357
say where did this come
from, list one or list two?

01:03:19.357 --> 01:03:20.440
You put it into that list.

01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:22.815
Let's say this
came from list two.

01:03:22.815 --> 01:03:25.970
And you put it back into
list two and then repeat.

01:03:25.970 --> 01:03:32.710
OK, so in log k time here
we have output k items.

01:03:32.710 --> 01:03:36.790
And so we end up with an r
log k running time overall.

01:03:36.790 --> 01:03:39.490
OK, so it's like
regular merge algorithm,

01:03:39.490 --> 01:03:43.420
except we use step
one to merge words,

01:03:43.420 --> 01:03:45.690
and then there's a
little bit of work.

01:03:45.690 --> 01:03:47.470
This is like old merging
algorithm, right?

01:03:47.470 --> 01:03:50.770
You take the min and
you put the max back in.

01:03:50.770 --> 01:03:55.040
Except now the max
is a whole word.

01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:58.030
OK that's how we merge.

01:03:58.030 --> 01:03:59.260
Now, why did we do a merger?

01:03:59.260 --> 01:04:01.770
Because next thing
we do is merge sort.

01:04:20.250 --> 01:04:22.160
And this is the
overall algorithm.

01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:23.070
It's one merge sort.

01:04:23.070 --> 01:04:24.750
We're going to use
this is the merger

01:04:24.750 --> 01:04:26.650
and we're going to use
this as the base case.

01:04:26.650 --> 01:04:30.110
So it's actually two recursive
levels of merge sort.

01:04:30.110 --> 01:04:33.390
Merge sort is recursive
within step four for a while,

01:04:33.390 --> 01:04:35.751
until we get down to the
level of a single word.

01:04:35.751 --> 01:04:38.250
Then we use this thing to deal
with things in a single word.

01:04:42.580 --> 01:04:49.230
So we end up with t of n
is 2 times t of n over 2

01:04:49.230 --> 01:04:55.890
plus n over k log k.

01:04:55.890 --> 01:05:00.000
And base case of
t of k is order k.

01:05:07.350 --> 01:05:08.670
Why is it all this?

01:05:08.670 --> 01:05:11.750
This thing is r.

01:05:15.450 --> 01:05:20.430
So we have r log k to do a
merge. r here is n over k.

01:05:20.430 --> 01:05:21.470
Why is it n over k?

01:05:24.250 --> 01:05:26.190
Because n is the
total number of items.

01:05:26.190 --> 01:05:29.190
We had r times k
items, so n equals rk.

01:05:29.190 --> 01:05:31.040
So r equals n over k.

01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:32.177
That's that.

01:05:32.177 --> 01:05:33.260
So this is our merge cost.

01:05:33.260 --> 01:05:38.160
This is the cost of 3,
this is the cost of 2.

01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:41.920
If we have only log
n log log n items,

01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:48.150
so k items, then we can
sort in linear time.

01:05:48.150 --> 01:05:50.332
So we just need to
solve this recurrence.

01:05:52.990 --> 01:05:56.820
Well, how's it going to work?

01:05:56.820 --> 01:06:00.770
It's going to be kind of like
merge sort, but not quite.

01:06:00.770 --> 01:06:01.270
Question?

01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:06.170
AUDIENCE: When you say-- so
you have-- it's definitely

01:06:06.170 --> 01:06:08.620
merging two lists
of sorted words

01:06:08.620 --> 01:06:11.070
into one sorted
list of two words.

01:06:11.070 --> 01:06:12.050
[INAUDIBLE]?

01:06:16.950 --> 01:06:18.910
You may have to do that, right?

01:06:21.232 --> 01:06:22.440
ERIK DEMAINE: Say that again.

01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:24.316
AUDIENCE: So you
have two sorted--

01:06:24.316 --> 01:06:27.425
two sorted lists
of R sorted words.

01:06:27.425 --> 01:06:28.800
ERIK DEMAINE: The
words are going

01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:31.530
to change, which elements are
in which words are changing.

01:06:31.530 --> 01:06:36.300
But that's thanks to
step one, for example.

01:06:36.300 --> 01:06:38.640
I mean, step one can
merge any two sorted words

01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:41.070
and make one sorted word.

01:06:41.070 --> 01:06:45.180
Or actually, one sorted word.

01:06:45.180 --> 01:06:48.360
In our case, we're going
to get two sorted words.

01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:49.840
That was the picture over here.

01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:51.510
I merge the two guys.

01:06:51.510 --> 01:06:54.720
I could represent it as one
word that's kind of double full,

01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:57.420
and then I can split
that into two words.

01:06:57.420 --> 01:06:59.190
So we again need
the split operation,

01:06:59.190 --> 01:07:04.620
but split is just a mask
these guys out and you

01:07:04.620 --> 01:07:05.760
get the high part.

01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:07.090
This is all 0.

01:07:07.090 --> 01:07:09.480
Then you shift it
over to the left,

01:07:09.480 --> 01:07:14.130
now you've got the high
word over the single word.

01:07:14.130 --> 01:07:17.230
So they're shuffling
within those two words,

01:07:17.230 --> 01:07:20.980
or within one word,
essentially, via this procedure,

01:07:20.980 --> 01:07:22.859
which we haven't covered.

01:07:22.859 --> 01:07:24.400
So everything is
going to mix around.

01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:27.064
But then there's the low
items and the high items.

01:07:27.064 --> 01:07:28.980
And so all the items in
here are less than all

01:07:28.980 --> 01:07:32.080
of the items in here.

01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:33.630
Other questions?

01:07:33.630 --> 01:07:34.980
Cool.

01:07:34.980 --> 01:07:37.150
So I need to solve
this recurrence.

01:07:37.150 --> 01:07:40.040
So let's draw another
recursion tree.

01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:42.250
That's the east way
to solve recurrences.

01:07:42.250 --> 01:07:44.970
Root is n over k log k.

01:07:44.970 --> 01:07:48.750
Next level down, see
n got divided by 2.

01:07:48.750 --> 01:07:57.690
So it's going to be 1/2 n over
k log k, 1/2 n over k log k,

01:07:57.690 --> 01:07:59.460
because the n gets divided by 2.

01:07:59.460 --> 01:08:01.410
So if I add up
everything on this level,

01:08:01.410 --> 01:08:04.080
I get n over k log k.

01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:06.870
And in general as I
go down, all levels

01:08:06.870 --> 01:08:10.080
are going to sum to this
same value, n over k log k.

01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:13.335
So up here we are going
to have a cost of n

01:08:13.335 --> 01:08:18.120
over k log k times
the number of levels.

01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:20.069
Now, this is where
it's a little tricky.

01:08:20.069 --> 01:08:22.080
It's not log n levels
like regular merge sort.

01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:25.010
We stop at level k.

01:08:25.010 --> 01:08:28.050
So it's going to
be log of n over k.

01:08:33.050 --> 01:08:35.370
That's the number
of levels we get to.

01:08:35.370 --> 01:08:40.939
Now at the leaf level finally
we have things of size order k,

01:08:40.939 --> 01:08:44.020
and we only pay order k.

01:08:44.020 --> 01:08:46.470
Great.

01:08:46.470 --> 01:08:48.915
And then how many
leaves are there?

01:08:48.915 --> 01:08:50.460
There's n over k leaves.

01:08:56.230 --> 01:08:56.729
OK.

01:08:56.729 --> 01:09:00.050
So, that's an order n cost.

01:09:00.050 --> 01:09:05.640
This is order k, that's
n over k, order n.

01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:08.715
What's this thing?

01:09:08.715 --> 01:09:09.779
Well, what's k?

01:09:09.779 --> 01:09:12.840
k was log n log log n.

01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:16.680
So this is n divided
by log n log log n.

01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:20.130
This, therefore, is
approximately log log n.

01:09:20.130 --> 01:09:22.330
So that log log n
cancels this one.

01:09:22.330 --> 01:09:26.065
This is approximately log n,
so that cancels with this one.

01:09:26.065 --> 01:09:29.340
So this is order n.

01:09:29.340 --> 01:09:32.104
That's why we
chose these values.

01:09:32.104 --> 01:09:34.229
So this n over k was not
actually that significant.

01:09:34.229 --> 01:09:35.700
We could have called that n.

01:09:35.700 --> 01:09:40.140
What is important is that this
recursion doesn't work when

01:09:40.140 --> 01:09:42.240
you get down to a single word.

01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:43.800
Can't do the same strategy.

01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:47.700
You need to use a different
merger for single words

01:09:47.700 --> 01:09:49.800
because here we have
to do bit tricks.

01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:51.180
For this merge
strategy we didn't

01:09:51.180 --> 01:09:53.305
have to do big tricks
because everything was bigger

01:09:53.305 --> 01:09:55.856
than a word.

01:09:55.856 --> 01:09:57.480
The reason why we
have these two levels

01:09:57.480 --> 01:10:01.050
is not to make the
time fast, it's just

01:10:01.050 --> 01:10:02.640
to make the algorithm work.

01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:05.880
I mean, to define the algorithm
there's within a word merging

01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:08.880
and over many words merging.

01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:11.910
The hard part is this one,
within a word merging.

01:10:11.910 --> 01:10:14.650
So that's our next goal.

01:10:14.650 --> 01:10:19.560
But if we could do that we
get linear time sorting for

01:10:19.560 --> 01:10:22.530
packed sorting when you can fit
log log log n things in a word.

01:10:22.530 --> 01:10:24.280
Any questions about
packed sorting?

01:10:27.180 --> 01:10:28.160
Good.

01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:33.800
So, last thing is how do
we merge two sorted words

01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:34.790
into one sorted word.

01:10:37.562 --> 01:10:39.770
And this is where we're
going to use bitonic sorting.

01:10:39.770 --> 01:10:42.394
See, it says right here, bitonic
sort for merging sorted words.

01:10:42.394 --> 01:10:45.500
Here we know what to do.

01:10:45.500 --> 01:10:47.048
Much easier in hindsight.

01:10:51.660 --> 01:10:53.660
So I'm going to take a
little diversion tell you

01:10:53.660 --> 01:10:56.405
about bitonic sorting, briefly.

01:11:01.240 --> 01:11:04.820
Because it's NCLRS I don't want
to spend too much time on it,

01:11:04.820 --> 01:11:07.740
but it is something we need.

01:11:07.740 --> 01:11:09.380
So you need to
know how it works.

01:11:14.310 --> 01:11:17.810
So first thing is the idea
of a bitonic sequence.

01:11:17.810 --> 01:11:26.150
This is going to be a cyclic
shift of a uni-modal sequence.

01:11:26.150 --> 01:11:32.900
So a non-decreasing plus
a non-increasing sequence.

01:11:36.110 --> 01:11:39.650
So I want non-decreasing
and then non-increasing.

01:11:39.650 --> 01:11:41.530
So this is a bitonic sequence.

01:11:41.530 --> 01:11:44.210
I think you know
what this means.

01:11:44.210 --> 01:11:46.920
Or it could be a
cyclic shift thereof.

01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:49.280
So I could, for example,
take this part here

01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:51.270
and shift it over to this side.

01:11:51.270 --> 01:11:55.220
So then I'd end up with
this, this, and this.

01:11:55.220 --> 01:11:56.606
This is also bitonic.

01:11:56.606 --> 01:11:57.980
or I could shift
this whole thing

01:11:57.980 --> 01:12:01.710
and put it over there
so I end up with that.

01:12:01.710 --> 01:12:03.470
That's also bitonic.

01:12:03.470 --> 01:12:06.890
So it basically has one
max, one min if you're

01:12:06.890 --> 01:12:08.630
reading it cyclically.

01:12:08.630 --> 01:12:10.882
One local max, one local min.

01:12:10.882 --> 01:12:13.090
Except, it's non-decreasing
so it's a little messier,

01:12:13.090 --> 01:12:16.230
but same thing.

01:12:16.230 --> 01:12:20.860
OK, let's go over here.

01:12:37.900 --> 01:12:39.870
So if you have a
bitonic sequence

01:12:39.870 --> 01:12:43.780
there's something called a
bitonic sorting network, which

01:12:43.780 --> 01:12:46.410
you can think of as a
parallel sorting algorithm,

01:12:46.410 --> 01:12:47.560
to sort such a thing.

01:12:47.560 --> 01:12:50.700
So it's almost
sorted, but not quite.

01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:52.620
And there's this
way of sorting them.

01:12:52.620 --> 01:12:57.900
So I'm going to draw a picture
to make it easier for me.

01:13:00.692 --> 01:13:02.400
It's a little more
annoying to write down

01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:03.450
the general algorithm.

01:13:03.450 --> 01:13:06.260
But so what I want to do,
suppose the number of elements

01:13:06.260 --> 01:13:07.014
is a power of 2.

01:13:07.014 --> 01:13:08.180
Here's what I'm going to do.

01:13:08.180 --> 01:13:12.059
First I compare the first
and the midway element.

01:13:12.059 --> 01:13:14.100
And then the next one with
the next one, and then

01:13:14.100 --> 01:13:16.800
the next one with the next one,
the next one with the next one.

01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:18.758
For each of these
comparisons I put those items

01:13:18.758 --> 01:13:20.080
in the correct order.

01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:22.250
So if I do that 3 versus
6, 3 is less than 6,

01:13:22.250 --> 01:13:24.800
so 3 stays here, 6 stays there.

01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:27.840
5 is bigger than 4 though,
so 4 comes over here,

01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:29.370
5 goes over here.

01:13:29.370 --> 01:13:35.430
Next is 7 versus 2, so 2 comes
over here, 7 comes over here.

01:13:35.430 --> 01:13:39.700
Nine versus 0, so 0 is
over here, 9 is over there.

01:13:39.700 --> 01:13:42.480
OK, that's an easy
set comparisons to do.

01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:45.710
The nice thing is you can
do all those in parallel.

01:13:45.710 --> 01:13:47.400
OK, just to check here.

01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:50.460
This was a monotone
increasing sub-sequence

01:13:50.460 --> 01:13:53.590
and then a monotone decreasing.

01:13:53.590 --> 01:13:57.270
Now, we have increasing
then decreasing.

01:13:57.270 --> 01:14:02.250
And then we have
decreasing then increasing.

01:14:02.250 --> 01:14:05.310
But if you look at the left
half or the right half,

01:14:05.310 --> 01:14:06.860
they are still bitonic.

01:14:06.860 --> 01:14:08.610
And that's an invariant.

01:14:08.610 --> 01:14:10.560
Bitonic will be preserved here.

01:14:10.560 --> 01:14:12.870
Also notice, all the
elements in the left

01:14:12.870 --> 01:14:14.870
are smaller than all the
elements in the right.

01:14:14.870 --> 01:14:16.620
That's not true for
an arbitrary sequence,

01:14:16.620 --> 01:14:18.328
but it will be true
for bitonic sequence.

01:14:18.328 --> 01:14:22.260
Essentially the max
is somewhere here

01:14:22.260 --> 01:14:25.050
and so it's going to
be spanned by some

01:14:25.050 --> 01:14:27.260
of these intervals, that max.

01:14:27.260 --> 01:14:29.760
And by spanning those intervals,
and in particular comparing

01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:31.504
that guy with
somebody on the right,

01:14:31.504 --> 01:14:32.920
the max will get
over to the right

01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:36.870
and then the rest of the
increasing and decreasing

01:14:36.870 --> 01:14:38.530
sub-sequences will follow.

01:14:38.530 --> 01:14:40.440
That's a very
hand-wavy argument.

01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:45.000
You can see CLRS for a
way to prove that OK, just

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:46.740
take it for granted now.

01:14:46.740 --> 01:14:48.420
Now, we recurse
on the two sides.

01:14:48.420 --> 01:14:52.320
So I compare 3 with 2, 4
with 0, I compare 6 with 7,

01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:53.510
and 6 with 9.

01:14:53.510 --> 01:14:54.990
So what do I get?

01:14:54.990 --> 01:14:56.760
2 is less than 3.

01:14:56.760 --> 01:14:58.570
0 is less than 4.

01:14:58.570 --> 01:15:02.450
Then I compare 6 with
7, so 6 less than 7.

01:15:02.450 --> 01:15:05.910
5 is less than 9.

01:15:05.910 --> 01:15:11.010
So now I've got four chunks,
this one, this one, this one,

01:15:11.010 --> 01:15:11.670
and this one.

01:15:11.670 --> 01:15:13.320
I recurse on each of them.

01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:18.110
So 0 is less than 2, 3 is
less than 4, 5 is less than 6,

01:15:18.110 --> 01:15:19.660
7 is less than 9.

01:15:19.660 --> 01:15:23.929
Now I have all my items in
sorted order, magically.

01:15:23.929 --> 01:15:25.470
OK, but if you
believe that invariant

01:15:25.470 --> 01:15:28.680
that the smallest
n over two items

01:15:28.680 --> 01:15:30.900
get to the left and the
larger n over two items

01:15:30.900 --> 01:15:34.740
get to the right, then by
induction this will sort them.

01:15:34.740 --> 01:15:37.431
Kind of like quick
sort in that sense.

01:15:37.431 --> 01:15:37.930
OK.

01:15:37.930 --> 01:15:39.600
The cool thing is I can
do all these in parallel,

01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:41.474
all these in parallel,
all these in parallel.

01:15:41.474 --> 01:15:46.140
So the total time is log k,
if I'm a parallel sorting

01:15:46.140 --> 01:15:48.030
algorithm or a sorting network.

01:15:48.030 --> 01:15:51.270
And log k is exactly
what I can afford.

01:15:51.270 --> 01:15:54.480
So the last thing to do is to
implement an operation like

01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:57.600
this, or like this-- this is
kind of the generic picture

01:15:57.600 --> 01:16:00.030
here--

01:16:00.030 --> 01:16:01.500
in constant time on a word ram.

01:16:13.380 --> 01:16:15.540
One other thing,
because I don't want

01:16:15.540 --> 01:16:17.010
to sort a bitonic sequence.

01:16:17.010 --> 01:16:17.890
That wasn't my goal.

01:16:17.890 --> 01:16:20.910
My goal was to merge
two sorted sequences.

01:16:20.910 --> 01:16:24.646
I have two sorted sequences,
I want to merge them.

01:16:24.646 --> 01:16:25.770
How do I make that bitonic?

01:16:28.460 --> 01:16:32.130
I just flip, like that.

01:16:32.130 --> 01:16:34.642
I take this sequence
and I reverse it.

01:16:34.642 --> 01:16:36.600
If I take a sorted sequence
and reverse it then

01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:37.391
it looks like this.

01:16:37.391 --> 01:16:39.600
And so then the
result is bitonic.

01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:41.850
Then I can use bitonic
sorting to sort it.

01:16:41.850 --> 01:16:43.950
So this is the merge
problem and I've just

01:16:43.950 --> 01:16:47.220
reduced it to bitonic sorting.

01:16:47.220 --> 01:16:48.060
Cool.

01:16:48.060 --> 01:16:52.610
Except, how do I
reverse a sequence

01:16:52.610 --> 01:16:56.770
in log k time on a word ram?

01:16:56.770 --> 01:16:57.480
Cute trick.

01:17:00.735 --> 01:17:04.950
If I have a word and it
has many items in it--

01:17:04.950 --> 01:17:07.042
that's our picture,
that's our set up here--

01:17:07.042 --> 01:17:09.000
and I want to reverse it
over all, what I'll do

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:12.990
is cut it in half, take all
these guys put them over here,

01:17:12.990 --> 01:17:15.870
take all these guys
put them over here.

01:17:15.870 --> 01:17:18.315
So I've got the right side--

01:17:18.315 --> 01:17:21.060
sorry, it's only four--

01:17:21.060 --> 01:17:22.480
cells over here.

01:17:22.480 --> 01:17:24.930
I've got the left
side over here.

01:17:24.930 --> 01:17:30.420
Then I recursively
reverse the sequence

01:17:30.420 --> 01:17:34.300
and recursively
reverse this sequence.

01:17:34.300 --> 01:17:37.220
And then I have the
reverse sequence.

01:17:37.220 --> 01:17:39.040
Right, this is a standard.

01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:42.220
One way to reverse items
is to do the big part

01:17:42.220 --> 01:17:43.830
and then recursively reverse.

01:17:43.830 --> 01:17:48.430
Then I will get, I mean
this is like ab reverse is

01:17:48.430 --> 01:17:51.180
equal to b reverse a reverse.

01:17:51.180 --> 01:17:52.570
Just a fun fact.

01:17:52.570 --> 01:17:55.180
So we're implementing that.

01:17:55.180 --> 01:17:56.810
Now how do I do this?

01:17:56.810 --> 01:17:59.860
Well, this is the thing I've
been talking about over here.

01:17:59.860 --> 01:18:02.764
You want to take the high part
you just mask that part out,

01:18:02.764 --> 01:18:03.680
shift it to the right.

01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:06.600
You want to take the low
part, just mask that part out.

01:18:06.600 --> 01:18:08.440
And so I can take
each of these parts

01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:10.330
individually, shift
this one to the left,

01:18:10.330 --> 01:18:12.610
shift this one to the
right, order them together,

01:18:12.610 --> 01:18:13.690
and I've reversed.

01:18:13.690 --> 01:18:16.000
So this takes constant time.

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.340
This is recursion but
the total number of steps

01:18:18.340 --> 01:18:23.770
will be order log k, which
is exactly what I can afford.

01:18:23.770 --> 01:18:26.260
So that's how I do
the reverse part.

01:18:26.260 --> 01:18:29.620
So if I want to merge, now
I have a bitonic sequence.

01:18:29.620 --> 01:18:35.080
Last thing to do is, how do
I do this bitonic comparison

01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:36.296
in constant time.

01:18:45.970 --> 01:18:47.665
So, that's next page.

01:18:52.734 --> 01:18:53.650
Here's a quick sketch.

01:19:01.740 --> 01:19:03.690
I'm going to try to draw
the generic picture.

01:19:03.690 --> 01:19:05.900
So the generic picture is
I have this thing which

01:19:05.900 --> 01:19:08.660
I call a, this thing
which I call b,

01:19:08.660 --> 01:19:11.960
and we basically want to compare
corresponding items in a and b.

01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:14.330
Though in fact, there's
another a over here and another

01:19:14.330 --> 01:19:15.320
b over here.

01:19:15.320 --> 01:19:18.110
In general, there are many
a's, many b's, but they appear

01:19:18.110 --> 01:19:19.580
in this nice periodic pattern.

01:19:19.580 --> 01:19:21.650
And so I'm just going
to look at one ab pair,

01:19:21.650 --> 01:19:24.500
but it's going to simultaneously
work for all of them

01:19:24.500 --> 01:19:26.186
with the same operations.

01:19:26.186 --> 01:19:27.560
So that's the dot,
dot, dot here.

01:19:27.560 --> 01:19:29.101
There's another a
and then another b,

01:19:29.101 --> 01:19:30.860
and another a and another b.

01:19:30.860 --> 01:19:32.810
So what do I do?

01:19:32.810 --> 01:19:40.760
First thing I do is
make 1aa, 1aa, 1aa.

01:19:40.760 --> 01:19:42.510
In other words, I
add in these 1 bits.

01:19:42.510 --> 01:19:46.555
Remember, we had zeros
there hanging out.

01:19:46.555 --> 01:19:48.230
That was when we were
going to use them.

01:19:48.230 --> 01:19:51.030
So I set them all to
ones in the a list.

01:19:51.030 --> 01:19:54.095
I take the b list, I just
shift it over and leave them

01:19:54.095 --> 01:19:54.595
as zeros.

01:20:00.300 --> 01:20:01.870
Time for bit tricks.

01:20:01.870 --> 01:20:05.160
Then I take this number, I
subtract it from this number.

01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:06.610
What do I get?

01:20:06.610 --> 01:20:10.140
I get zeros or ones for
whether this bit got

01:20:10.140 --> 01:20:12.030
borrowed, which tells
me whether little a is

01:20:12.030 --> 01:20:13.350
bigger than little b.

01:20:13.350 --> 01:20:14.440
Then I get some junk.

01:20:14.440 --> 01:20:15.300
And then I get 0, 1.

01:20:15.300 --> 01:20:16.320
Junk.

01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:17.310
So on.

01:20:17.310 --> 01:20:20.730
0, 1, junk.

01:20:20.730 --> 01:20:23.880
So 0 corresponds
to a being smaller

01:20:23.880 --> 01:20:26.720
than b, and 1 corresponds
to the reverse.

01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:27.800
OK, whatever.

01:20:27.800 --> 01:20:31.820
Then I do my usual masking,
just the 0, 1 bits,

01:20:31.820 --> 01:20:32.820
then there's some zeros.

01:20:36.640 --> 01:20:38.760
OK, here's a new trick
which we haven't seen yet.

01:20:38.760 --> 01:20:42.450
I'm going to shift this to the
right by two, or in general

01:20:42.450 --> 01:20:44.470
by the size of those items.

01:20:44.470 --> 01:20:48.810
So now I have 0, 1 here,
0, 1 here, 0, 1 here.

01:20:48.810 --> 01:20:50.880
Each of these bits
might be different.

01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:53.140
So I take this,
shift to the right.

01:20:53.140 --> 01:20:55.560
Now I subtract.

01:20:55.560 --> 01:20:57.400
What this gives me--

01:20:57.400 --> 01:21:00.690
so I'm taking 1,
0, 0, 0, minus 1.

01:21:00.690 --> 01:21:03.750
What I get is 0, 1, 1, 1.

01:21:03.750 --> 01:21:06.160
OK, in this case,
there's just two bits.

01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:07.230
Except it's not 1, 1.

01:21:07.230 --> 01:21:14.760
It's either 0, 0 or 1, 1.

01:21:14.760 --> 01:21:22.120
And then we have here 0, and
then 0, 0 or 1, 1, and so on.

01:21:22.120 --> 01:21:24.630
So now these are masks.

01:21:24.630 --> 01:21:28.410
The zeros correspond to
when the a's were smaller,

01:21:28.410 --> 01:21:31.020
the ones correspond to
when the b's are smaller.

01:21:31.020 --> 01:21:38.430
So if I take this [? added ?]
with this, I get the large b's.

01:21:38.430 --> 01:21:42.480
If I take this [? added ?]
with this, I get the small a's.

01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:45.630
Or one of some of
those combinations.

01:21:45.630 --> 01:21:48.240
The point is I take--

01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:51.895
I think here I
get the small a's.

01:21:55.080 --> 01:22:05.265
And then if I take this thing
and negate it and then mask it

01:22:05.265 --> 01:22:07.740
with this I get the small b's.

01:22:11.750 --> 01:22:13.120
And then I take this thing--

01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:14.950
I ran out of room.

01:22:14.950 --> 01:22:19.210
So I've got small
a's, small b's.

01:22:22.240 --> 01:22:25.450
I take this thing I shift it
over so I have small b's here.

01:22:29.020 --> 01:22:33.620
And then I OR these together,
I get all the smalls.

01:22:33.620 --> 01:22:36.940
OK, these are designed to
never conflict because I

01:22:36.940 --> 01:22:38.604
took the inversion here.

01:22:38.604 --> 01:22:40.770
So I get the smaller of the
a's, smaller of the b's.

01:22:40.770 --> 01:22:44.590
So now I put the smaller
things in the right order.

01:22:44.590 --> 01:22:48.170
I do exactly the same procedure
negated, and get the larges.

01:22:51.210 --> 01:22:54.530
And then I OR these
together and I get sorted.

01:22:57.430 --> 01:22:58.330
Well, not sorted.

01:22:58.330 --> 01:23:01.600
I get whatever bitonic
sort would have done.

01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:05.140
It's doing these pairwise
comparisons by doing this shift

01:23:05.140 --> 01:23:06.970
and it's putting things
in the right order.

01:23:06.970 --> 01:23:08.890
The small ones always
end up on the left,

01:23:08.890 --> 01:23:10.640
the large ones always
end up on the right.

01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:13.790
That's the definition of
the operation we want to do.

01:23:13.790 --> 01:23:16.769
Bitonic operated.

01:23:16.769 --> 01:23:19.060
And because we are just doing
shifts, and subtractions,

01:23:19.060 --> 01:23:21.610
and all these things, it works
even though there's not just

01:23:21.610 --> 01:23:23.830
one ab pair, but there's
a whole bunch of ab pairs.

01:23:23.830 --> 01:23:28.460
They will all be shifted, and
computed, and sorted together.

01:23:28.460 --> 01:23:31.210
It's a little hard
to visualize but this

01:23:31.210 --> 01:23:34.090
will do one bitonic operation
and a constant number

01:23:34.090 --> 01:23:35.890
of word ram operations.

01:23:35.890 --> 01:23:38.350
And so you pop out
all these stacks

01:23:38.350 --> 01:23:41.110
this gives us a merger, that
gives us packed sorting,

01:23:41.110 --> 01:23:45.130
and with packed sorting
we get signature sorting.

01:23:45.130 --> 01:23:47.351
Easy, right?

01:23:47.351 --> 01:23:49.600
All right, that's probably
one of the most complicated

01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:51.058
algorithms we'll
see in this class.

01:23:51.058 --> 01:23:53.230
But from that you get
a priority queue that

01:23:53.230 --> 01:23:56.110
runs in constant time provided
w is a little bigger than log

01:23:56.110 --> 01:23:57.010
squared n.

01:23:57.010 --> 01:23:58.560
Boom.
