00:00:25.719 --> 00:00:26.510
ERIK DEMAINE: Yeah.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.340
I'm going to talk
about I/O models.

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:29.840
Just to get a sense,
how many people

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.510
know a model called I/O model?

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.851
And how many people don't?

00:00:35.851 --> 00:00:36.600
It doesn't matter.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.990
I'm just curious.

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.210
As some of you may
know, I/O models

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:42.440
have a really rich history.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.030
And they're pretty fascinating.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.770
They are all central to this
problem of modeling the memory

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.210
hierarchy in a computer.

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.970
We have things like RAM
model of computation

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.390
where you can access anything at
the same price in your memory.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.040
But the reality of
computers is you

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.200
have things that are
very close to you that

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.030
are very cheap to
access, and you

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.630
have things that are very
far from you that are big.

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.090
You can get 3 terabyte
disks these days,

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.880
but are very slow to access.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.010
And one of the big
costs there is latency.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.000
Because here, the head has to
move to the right position,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.820
and then you can read
lots of data really fast.

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.460
The disk actually can
give you data very fast,

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.167
but the hard part is getting
started in reading stuff.

00:01:26.167 --> 00:01:28.250
And so this is the sort
of thing we want to model.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.190
These kinds of computers
have been around for decades,

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.820
as we'll see.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.528
And people have been
trying to model them

00:01:33.528 --> 00:01:36.050
in as clean a way as possible
that works well theoretically

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.920
and matches practice
in some ways.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.795
I have just some fun
additions to this slide.

00:01:41.795 --> 00:01:44.120
You can keep getting
bigger, go to the internet,

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.910
get to an exa- or a zettabyte.

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.620
You have to look up all
the words for these.

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.180
In the universe,
you've got about 10

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.250
to the 83 atoms, so maybe
roughly that many bits.

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.570
But I don't know if
there's a letter for them.

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.140
So how do we model this?

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.410
Well, there's a lot of models.

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:02.620
This is a partial list.

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.950
These are sort of the core
models that were around,

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.280
let's say, since
this millennium.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.820
So we start in 1972 and
work our way forward.

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.500
And I'm going to go
through all of these

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.030
in different levels of detail.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.270
There's a couple of
key features in a cache

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.467
that we want to model or
maybe a few key features.

00:02:23.467 --> 00:02:25.550
And then there's some
measure of simplicity, which

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:26.674
is a little hard to define.

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.690
The goal is to get all four
of these things at once.

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.750
And we get that more
or less by the end.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.545
So first section is on this
idealized two-level storage,

00:02:40.545 --> 00:02:44.930
which was introduced
by Bob Floyd in 1972.

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.220
This is what the first page
of the paper looks like.

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.200
It's probably typeset
on a typewriter

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.560
it looks like and underline,
good old days of computer

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.740
science, very early days
of computer science.

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.470
And this was published
in a conference

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.720
called The Complexity of
Computer Computations.

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.001
How many people have
heard of that conference?

00:03:06.001 --> 00:03:06.500
No one.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.999
Wow.

00:03:06.999 --> 00:03:07.880
There it is.

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.380
It's a kind of a
classic, because it

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.870
had Karp's original
paper on NP-completeness.

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.220
So you've definitely
read this paper.

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.884
But there are a lot of
neat papers in there

00:03:16.884 --> 00:03:19.550
and a panel discussion including
what should we call algorithms,

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:21.830
which is kind of a fun read.

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.190
So this is in the day when
one of the state of the art

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.650
computers was the PDP-11.

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.770
This is what PDP-11,
or one of them,

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:34.850
looks like by probably
owned by Bell Labs.

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:36.710
But Dennis Ritchie
and Ken Thompson's

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:39.590
the inventors of C and
Unix, working away there.

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:45.860
It has disks, each of which is
about 2 megabytes in capacity.

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:50.040
And it has internal memory which
was core memory at the time.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.360
So each of these is a little
circular magnetic core.

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.010
And it stores 1 bit.

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:56.930
And in total, there
are 8 kilobytes.

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.220
So you get a sense of
already this being an issue.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.060
And this is why they
wrote their paper.

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.560
So here's the model
they introduced,

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.000
a very simple model, maybe
the simplest we'll see.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.210
You have your CPU, which
can do local computation.

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:14.720
And then you have your
memory, which is very big.

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.810
But in particular, it's divided
into these blocks of size B.

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.390
So each block can
have up to B items.

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:23.720
And what you're allowed to
do in one block operation

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.754
is read two of the blocks.

00:04:26.754 --> 00:04:28.420
You can read all the
items in the block.

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:30.260
So let's say you
read these two items.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.764
You pick some subset of
those items to pick up.

00:04:33.764 --> 00:04:35.180
And then what
you're allowed to do

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.830
is store them somewhere else.

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.280
So you can pick some other
target block like this one

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.885
and copy those elements
to overwrite that block.

00:04:44.885 --> 00:04:46.760
I mean, there's no
computation in this model,

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.330
because he was just interested
in how you can permute items

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:51.950
in that world.

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.710
So simple model, but
you get the idea.

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.310
You can read two blocks, take
up to B items out of them,

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:59.310
stick them in here.

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.820
Here, we just ignore what
the order is within a block,

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.070
because we're assuming you
can just rearrange once you

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.050
read them in and spit them out.

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.270
So don't worry about the
order within the block.

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.300
It's more for every item,
which block is it in?

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.730
And we're assuming here
items are indivisible.

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.670
So here's the main
theorem of that paper.

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:22.000
If you're given N items and
you want to permute them into N

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.620
over B blocks, which means each
of those blocks is going to be

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.210
full-- let's say that's sort
of the most interesting case--

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:32.730
then you need to use N over
B log B block operations

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:37.540
even for a random permutation on
average with high probability.

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:41.680
So this is kind of nice
or kind of interesting,

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.950
because just to touch
those blocks requires

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:47.590
N over B block operations.

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:51.120
But there's an extra log
factor that starts to creep up,

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.711
which is maybe a little bit
surprising, less surprising

00:05:54.711 --> 00:05:57.210
to people who are familiar with
I/O models, but at the time,

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:58.377
very new.

00:05:58.377 --> 00:06:00.210
And I'm making a
particular assumption here,

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:01.110
but just a small thing.

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:02.490
I thought I'd go through
the proof of this theorem,

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.346
because it's fairly simple.

00:06:04.346 --> 00:06:05.970
It's going to use a
slightly simplified

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:09.010
model where, instead of copying
items, you actually move items.

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:11.160
So these guys would
disappear after you put them

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.017
in this new block.

00:06:12.017 --> 00:06:14.100
Because we're thinking
about permutation problems,

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:16.536
again, that doesn't
really change anything.

00:06:16.536 --> 00:06:17.910
You can just, for
every item, see

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:20.220
what path it follows to
ultimately get to its target

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:22.770
location, throw away
all the extra copies

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:25.020
and just keep that
one set of copies.

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.820
And that will still be a
valid solution in this model.

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:29.990
So how does the lower bound go?

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:32.010
It's a simple
potential argument.

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:36.540
You look at for
every pair of blocks,

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:39.270
how many items
are there in block

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:41.270
i that are destined for block j?

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:43.135
You want to move from
block i to block j.

00:06:43.135 --> 00:06:44.760
This is going to be
changing over time.

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.560
This is where they
currently are.

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:48.510
So that's nij.

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:51.630
You take and nij, log nij,
and sum that up over all

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:52.950
i's and j's.

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:54.610
That's the potential function.

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:58.920
And our goal is to
maximize that potential.

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:00.840
Because it's going to be--

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.310
for those familiar
with entropy--

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:03.400
negative entropy.

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:08.220
So it's going to be maximized
when all the items are

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:09.960
where they need to be.

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:12.510
This is when everything is
as clustered as possible.

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:14.280
You can only have a
cluster of size B,

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:18.430
because items can only be
up to B in the same place.

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:21.000
One way to see this, in
the target configuration,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.144
nii is B for all i.

00:07:23.144 --> 00:07:24.810
Everyone's where
they're supposed to be.

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:27.990
And so that potential gives
you the number of items

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:30.390
times log B. And this
is always, at most,

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:34.290
log B. And so that's the biggest
this could ever hope to get.

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:36.810
So our goal is to increase
entropy as much as possible.

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:38.310
And we're starting
with low entropy.

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:41.130
If you take a
random permutation,

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:43.620
you're trying to get the
expected number of guys

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:44.610
that are where they're
supposed to be.

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:46.151
It's very small,
because most of them

00:07:46.151 --> 00:07:49.350
are going to be destined
for some other block.

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:52.350
So we're starting with
the potential of linear.

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:56.730
We need to get to N log
B. And then the claim is

00:07:56.730 --> 00:08:00.960
that each block operation we
do can only increase potential

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:04.790
by, at most, B. And
so that gives us

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:06.930
this bound of the
potential we need

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:10.710
to get to minus the potential we
had divided by how much we can

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:15.510
decrease potential in each step,
which is basically N over B log

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:18.720
B minus a little O.

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.190
Why is this claim true?

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:21.300
I'll just sketch.

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:24.930
The idea is this fun fact,
the x plus y log x plus y

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:28.500
is, at most, x log x plus
y log y plus x plus y.

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:31.470
What this means is if
you have two clusters,

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:33.090
our goal is to sort
of cluster things

00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:36.615
together and make bigger groups
that are in the same place

00:08:36.615 --> 00:08:39.309
or in the correct place.

00:08:39.309 --> 00:08:41.400
So if you have two clusters
x log x and y log y

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.830
contributing to this
thing and you merge them,

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:46.020
then you now have
this potential.

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:49.710
And the claim is that could
have only gone up by x plus y.

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:52.740
And when you're moving B
items, the total number

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:55.200
of things you're moving
is B. So you can only

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.850
increase things by B.
So it was a quick sketch

00:08:57.850 --> 00:08:58.620
of this old paper.

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:03.810
It's a fun read, quite
clear, easy argument.

00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:07.110
So we proved this theorem that
you need at least N over B

00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:08.850
log B. But what is
the right answer?

00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:11.640
There's actually not a
matching upper bound.

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:14.670
Of course, for B at constant,
this is the right answer.

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:20.100
It's N, but that's
not so exciting.

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:21.900
On the upper bound
side, this paper

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:23.896
has almost matching lower bound.

00:09:23.896 --> 00:09:25.770
It's another log, but
not quite the same log,

00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:28.590
N over B log N over
B instead of log B.

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:30.480
And the rough idea
of how to do that--

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:30.960
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:32.168
ERIK DEMAINE: Yeah, question.

00:09:32.168 --> 00:09:34.377
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:34.377 --> 00:09:36.210
ERIK DEMAINE: I said a
tall disk assumption.

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:39.330
I'm assuming N over
B is greater than B.

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:41.640
The number of
blocks in your disk

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:44.036
is at least the size of a block.

00:09:44.036 --> 00:09:45.660
AUDIENCE: You needed
that in the proof?

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:47.701
ERIK DEMAINE: I needed
that in the proof I think.

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:55.214
Good question, Where
N over B log B.

00:09:55.214 --> 00:09:57.910
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:57.910 --> 00:09:58.930
ERIK DEMAINE: Yeah.

00:09:58.930 --> 00:09:59.560
Exactly.

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:00.893
Yeah, that's where I'm using it.

00:10:00.893 --> 00:10:02.800
Thanks.

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:06.210
Otherwise this expectation
doesn't work out.

00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:08.860
I mean, if you have one block,
for example, this will fail,

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:12.090
because you need
zero operations.

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:15.230
So there has to be some trade
off at the very small regime.

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:15.730
OK.

00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:18.400
So the way to get N
over B log N over B

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:20.950
is basically a radix sort.

00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:23.140
In one pass through
the data, you

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:28.060
can rewrite everything to
have the lower order bits of 0

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:30.100
before all the lower
order bits of 1.

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:33.940
So in N over B, you can sort
by each bit in the target

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:36.730
block ID of every item.

00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:38.712
And so you do log
of N over B things,

00:10:38.712 --> 00:10:40.420
because that's how
many blocks there are.

00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:41.836
And so this is how
many passes you

00:10:41.836 --> 00:10:44.500
need by a binary radix sort.

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:47.080
You can achieve that bound.

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:52.507
And the paper actually claims
that there's a lower bound.

00:10:52.507 --> 00:10:54.090
It's a little strange,
because there's

00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:55.660
a careful proof given for this.

00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:58.060
And then this claim just
says, "by information

00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:01.774
theoretic consideration--"
this is also true.

00:11:01.774 --> 00:11:03.190
This is in the
days when we didn't

00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:05.650
distinguish between
big O and big omega

00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:08.290
before [INAUDIBLE] paper.

00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:09.280
But this is not true.

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:11.210
And we'll see that
it's not true.

00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:15.220
It was settled about
14 years later.

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:17.720
So we'll see the right answer.

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:20.320
This is almost the right
answer, but it doesn't quite

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:22.180
work when B is very small.

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:24.850
And one way to see
that is when B is 1.

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:28.650
When B is 1, the right
answer is N, not N log N.

00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:32.814
So when B is less
than log N over B,

00:11:32.814 --> 00:11:34.480
then there's a slightly
different answer

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:35.910
which we'll get to later.

00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:37.740
But that was the early days.

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:42.100
There's some other fun quotes
from this paper foreshadowing

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:43.100
different things.

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:46.270
One is the word RAM model,
which is very common today,

00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:47.579
but not at the time.

00:11:47.579 --> 00:11:49.120
And it says, obviously,
these results

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:51.370
apply for distant drums,
which was probably

00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:53.078
what they were thinking
about originally,

00:11:53.078 --> 00:11:54.970
but also when the
pages, the blocks,

00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:57.404
are words of internal
memory and the records

00:11:57.404 --> 00:11:58.570
are the bits in those words.

00:11:58.570 --> 00:11:59.820
So this is a word RAM model.

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:05.537
Here, I said just ignore the
permutation within each block.

00:12:05.537 --> 00:12:07.120
But you can actually
do all the things

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:09.040
you need to do for
these algorithms using

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:12.800
shifts and logical or,
xor, and operations.

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:15.250
So all these algorithms work
in the word RAM model, too,

00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:17.440
which is kind of nifty.

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:20.230
Another thing is
foreshadowing, what

00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:22.660
we call the I/O model, which
we'll get to in a little bit.

00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:24.990
It says, "work is in progress."

00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:26.410
He got scooped, unfortunately.

00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:29.095
"Work is in progress--" unless
he meant by someone else--

00:12:29.095 --> 00:12:32.860
"attempting to study
the case where you

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:34.300
can store more than two pages."

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:37.060
Basically, this CPU can
hold two of these blocks,

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:41.920
and then write one back out, but
has no bigger memory than that.

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:43.720
or bigger cache.

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:46.150
So that's where we
were at the time.

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:50.010
Next, chapter in
this story is 1981.

00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:50.810
It's a good year.

00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:52.750
It was when I was born.

00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:55.690
And this is Hong
and Kung's paper.

00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:58.480
You've probably heard about
the red-blue pebble game.

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:01.690
And it's also a two-level
model, but now there's

00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:03.340
a cache in the middle.

00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:05.860
And you can remember
stuff for a while.

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:07.840
I mean, you can
remember up to M things

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:09.520
before you have
to kick them out.

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:11.720
The difference here is
there's no blocks anymore.

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:13.490
It's just items.

00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:15.490
So let me tell you a
little bit about the paper.

00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:17.500
This was the state of the
art in computing at the time.

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:19.458
The personal computer
revolution was happening.

00:13:19.458 --> 00:13:22.450
They had the Apple
II, TRS-80, VIC-20.

00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:25.660
All of these originally had
about 4 kilobytes of RAM.

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:28.910
And the disks could store
maybe, I don't know,

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:31.060
360 kilobytes or so.

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:34.302
But you could also connect a
tape and other crazy things.

00:13:34.302 --> 00:13:35.510
So, again, this was relevant.

00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:37.879
And that's the setting
they were writing this.

00:13:37.879 --> 00:13:38.920
They have this fun quote.

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:41.530
"When a large computation is
performed on a small device--"

00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:44.027
at that point, small devices
were becoming common--

00:13:44.027 --> 00:13:45.610
"you must decompose
those computations

00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:47.100
to subcomputations."

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:49.940
This is going to require a lot
of I/O. It's going to be slow.

00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:52.990
So how do we minimize I/O?

00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:57.700
So their model-- before I get
to this red-blue pebble game

00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:03.520
model, it's based on a vanilla
single color pebble game model

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:05.200
by a Hopcroft,
Paul, and Valiant.

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:07.780
This is the famous interrelation
between the time hierarchy

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:10.720
and space hierarchy paper.

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:14.380
And what they said is, OK,
let's think of the algorithm

00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:15.880
we're executing as a DAG.

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:18.370
We start with some
things that are inputs.

00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:22.960
And we want to compute stuff
that this computation depends

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:24.657
on having these two
values and so on.

00:14:24.657 --> 00:14:26.490
In the end, we want to
compute some outputs.

00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:29.920
So you can rewrite computation
in this kind of DAG form.

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:33.160
And we're going to model
the execution of that

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:35.110
by playing this pebble game.

00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:37.790
And so a node can
have pebbles on it.

00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:40.290
And for example, we could
put a pebble on this node.

00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:43.180
In general, we are allowed
to put a pebble on a node

00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:46.300
if all of its predecessors
have a pebble.

00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:49.390
And pebble is going to
correspond to being in memory.

00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:51.640
And we can also throw away
a node, because we can just

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:53.140
forget stuff.

00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:55.240
Unlike real life, you can
just forget whatever you

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:56.830
don't want to know any more.

00:14:56.830 --> 00:14:58.420
So you add a pebble.

00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:00.460
Let's say, now we
can add this pebble,

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:03.570
because its predecessor
has a pebble on it.

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:06.777
We can add this pebble over
here, add this pebble here.

00:15:06.777 --> 00:15:08.610
Now, we don't need this
information anymore,

00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:10.610
because we've computed
all the things out of it.

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:12.450
So we can choose to
remove that pebble.

00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:15.810
And now, we can add this one,
remove that one, add this one.

00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:20.340
You can check that I got all
these right, add this one,

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:23.669
remove that one, remove,
add, remove, remove.

00:15:23.669 --> 00:15:25.460
In the end, we want
pebbles on the outputs.

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:27.450
We start with pebbles
on the inputs.

00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:31.500
And in this case, their goal was
to minimize the maximum number

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:32.790
of pebbles over time.

00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:36.030
Here, there's up to four
pebbles at any one moment.

00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:40.020
That means you need
memory of size four.

00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:42.990
And they ended up proving
that any DAG can be executed

00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:45.360
using N over log N
maximum pebbles, which

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:47.260
gave this theorem time.

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:49.270
If you use t units of
time, you can fit in t

00:15:49.270 --> 00:15:52.980
over log t units of space,
which was a neat advance.

00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:55.906
But that's beside the point.

00:15:55.906 --> 00:15:57.780
This is where Hong and
Kung were coming from.

00:15:57.780 --> 00:15:58.904
They had this pebble model.

00:15:58.904 --> 00:16:01.410
And they wanted to use
two colors of pebbles, one

00:16:01.410 --> 00:16:06.030
to represent the shallower
level of the memory hierarchy

00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:10.150
in cache, and the other to say
that you're on disk somewhere.

00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:12.240
So red pebble is
going to be in cache.

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:13.320
That's the hot stuff.

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:15.150
And the blue pebbles
are our disk.

00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:17.370
That's the cold stuff.

00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:19.960
And, basically, the same rules--

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:21.930
when you're initially
placing a pebble,

00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:23.512
everything here has to be red.

00:16:23.512 --> 00:16:25.470
You can place a red pebble
if your predecessors

00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:26.384
have red pebbles.

00:16:26.384 --> 00:16:28.050
We start out with the
inputs being blue,

00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:29.560
so there are no red pebbles.

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:31.450
But for free-- or not for free.

00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:33.444
For unit cost, we can
convert any red pebble

00:16:33.444 --> 00:16:35.610
to a blue pebble or any
blue pebble to a red pebble.

00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:36.960
So let's go through this.

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:38.370
I can make that one red.

00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:40.080
And now, I can
make this one red.

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:40.889
Great.

00:16:40.889 --> 00:16:42.180
Now, I don't need it right now.

00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:45.925
So I'm going to make it blue,
meaning write it out to disk.

00:16:45.925 --> 00:16:47.699
I make this one red,
make this one red.

00:16:47.699 --> 00:16:48.990
Now, I can throw that one away.

00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:51.360
I don't need it
on cache or disk.

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:54.570
I can put that one
on disk, because I

00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:56.430
don't need it right now.

00:16:56.430 --> 00:17:00.300
I can bring that one
back in from cache,

00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:03.205
write this one out,
put that one onto disk,

00:17:03.205 --> 00:17:04.079
put that onto a disk.

00:17:04.079 --> 00:17:06.990
Now, we'll go over here,
read this back in from disk,

00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:09.460
finish off this
section over here.

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:13.805
And now, I can throw that away,
add this guy, throw that away.

00:17:13.805 --> 00:17:14.430
What do I need?

00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:15.846
Now, I can write
this out to disk.

00:17:15.846 --> 00:17:17.200
I'm done with the output.

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:18.866
Now, I've got to read
all these guys in,

00:17:18.866 --> 00:17:20.550
and then I can do this one.

00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:23.430
And so I needed a cache
size here of four.

00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:26.980
The maximum number of red
things at any moment was four.

00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:29.820
And I can get rid of those guys
and write that one to disk.

00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:32.460
And my goal is to get
the outputs all blue.

00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:33.960
But the objective
here is different.

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:37.650
Before, we were minimizing,
essentially, cache size.

00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:39.150
Cache size now is given to us.

00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:41.114
We say we have a
cache of size M.

00:17:41.114 --> 00:17:43.530
But now, what we count are the
number of reads and writes,

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:45.690
the number of switching
colors of pebbles.

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:48.895
That is the number I/Os.

00:17:48.895 --> 00:17:51.930
And so you can think of
this model as this picture

00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:53.010
I drew before.

00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:53.640
You have cache.

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:55.590
You can store up to M items.

00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:59.940
You can take any blue item.

00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:01.860
You could throw them
away, for example.

00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:04.380
I could move a red item
over here, turn it blue.

00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:06.480
That corresponds to
writing out to disk.

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:09.510
I can bring a blue item
back in to fill that spot.

00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:12.180
That corresponds to reading from
disk as long as, at all times,

00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:14.760
I have at most M red items.

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:18.100
And these are the same model.

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:20.640
So what Hong and
Kung did is look

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:24.120
at a bunch of different
algorithms, not problems,

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:26.160
but specific algorithms,
things that you

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:28.464
could compute in the DAG form.

00:18:28.464 --> 00:18:29.880
The DAG form is,
I guess you could

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:31.387
say, a class of algorithms.

00:18:31.387 --> 00:18:32.970
There's many ways
to execute this DAG.

00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:37.470
You could follow any
topological sort of this DAG.

00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:39.700
That's an algorithm
in some sense.

00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:44.940
And so what he's finding is the
best execution of these meta

00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:46.500
algorithms, if you will.

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:51.450
So that doesn't mean it's the
best way to do matrix vector

00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:52.080
multiplication.

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:54.450
But it says if you're following
the standard algorithm,

00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:57.380
the standard DAG that you get
from it or the standard FFT

00:18:57.380 --> 00:18:58.045
DAG--

00:18:58.045 --> 00:19:00.090
I guess FFT is
actually an algorithm--

00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:03.960
then the minimum number
of memory transfers

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:08.859
is this number of red
or blue recolorings.

00:19:08.859 --> 00:19:09.900
And so you get a variety.

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:14.130
Of course, the speed-ups,
relative to the regular RAM

00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:17.550
analysis versus this analysis is
going to be somewhere between 1

00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:23.306
and M, I guess for
most problems at least.

00:19:23.306 --> 00:19:25.680
And for some problems, like
matrix vector multiplication,

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:30.000
you get very good M odd even
transpositions [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.120
you get M. Matrix
multiplication, not quite

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:36.690
as good red M and FFT.

00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:38.792
Sorting was not analyzed
here, because sorting

00:19:38.792 --> 00:19:40.000
is many different algorithms.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:45.360
Just one specific algorithm
analyzed here, only log M.

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:47.760
So I don't want to go
through these analyzes,

00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:49.980
because a lot of them will
follow from other results

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:52.489
that we'll get to.

00:19:52.489 --> 00:19:54.030
So at this point,
we have two models.

00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:57.210
We have the idealized
two-level storage of Floyd.

00:19:57.210 --> 00:19:59.550
We have the red-blue pebble
game of Hong and Kung.

00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:02.130
This one models
caching, that you

00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:03.300
can store a bunch of things.

00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:04.466
But it does not have blocks.

00:20:04.466 --> 00:20:07.740
This one models blocking,
but it does not have a cache,

00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:10.020
or it has a cache
of constant size.

00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:12.690
So the idea is to
merge these two models.

00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:15.540
And this is the Aggarwal
and Vitter paper many of you

00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:17.160
have heard of, I'm sure.

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:21.135
It was in 1987, so six
years after Hong and Kung.

00:20:21.135 --> 00:20:22.960
It has many names.

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:25.609
I/O model is the
original, I guess.

00:20:25.609 --> 00:20:27.400
External Memory Model
is what I usually use

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:28.890
and a bunch of people here use.

00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:32.610
Disk Access Model has the nice
advantage of you can call it

00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:34.080
the DAM model.

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:38.400
And, again, our goal is to
minimize number of I/Os.

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:40.650
It's just a fusion
of the two models.

00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:44.100
Now, our cache has
blocks of size B.

00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:46.680
And you have M over B blocks.

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:49.840
And your disk is also
divided into blocks of size

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:52.350
B. We imagine it being as
large as you need it to be,

00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:54.690
probably about order N.

00:20:54.690 --> 00:20:56.230
And what can you do?

00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:58.980
Well, you can pick up
one of these blocks

00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:01.350
and read it in
from disk to cache,

00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:04.710
so kicking out whatever
used to be there.

00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:06.510
You can do computation
internally,

00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:10.350
change whatever these items
are for free, let's say.

00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:12.750
You could measure
time, but usually

00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:15.090
you just measure a number
of memory transfers.

00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:16.860
And then you can take
one of these blocks

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:18.780
and write it back out
to disk, kicking out

00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:20.310
whatever used to be there.

00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:23.020
So it's the obvious
hybrid of these models.

00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:26.354
But this turns out to
be a really good model.

00:21:26.354 --> 00:21:28.270
Those other two models,
they were interesting.

00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:28.894
They were toys.

00:21:28.894 --> 00:21:29.790
They were simple.

00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:33.605
This is basically as simple,
but it spawned this whole field.

00:21:33.605 --> 00:21:35.190
And it's why we're here today.

00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:39.090
So this is a really
cool model, let's say,

00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:40.389
tons of results in this model.

00:21:40.389 --> 00:21:41.430
It's interesting to see--

00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:43.967
I'm going to talk about
a lot of models today.

00:21:43.967 --> 00:21:46.050
We're sort of in the middle
of them at the moment.

00:21:46.050 --> 00:21:48.960
But only two have really
caught on in a big way

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:51.190
and have led to lots
and lots of papers.

00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:53.950
This is one of them.

00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:56.930
So let me tell you some basic
results and how to do them.

00:21:56.930 --> 00:22:02.880
A simple approach algorithmic
technique in external memory

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:04.290
is to scan.

00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:06.710
So here's my data.

00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:10.680
If I just want to read items in
order and stop at some point N,

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:13.710
then that cost me order N
over B memory transfers.

00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:14.340
That's optimal.

00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:15.548
I've got to read the data in.

00:22:15.548 --> 00:22:18.240
I can accumulate, add them
up, multiply them together,

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:19.650
whatever.

00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:22.230
One thing to be careful
with those is plus 1,

00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:24.180
or you could put
a ceiling on that.

00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:27.000
If N is a lot less and B, then
this is not a good strategy.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.930
But as long as N is
at least order B,

00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:33.030
that's really efficient.

00:22:33.030 --> 00:22:36.060
More generally, instead
of just one scan,

00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:39.270
you can run up to M
over B parallel scans.

00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:41.220
Because for a scan,
you really just need

00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:44.250
to know what is my
block currently.

00:22:44.250 --> 00:22:47.100
And we can fit M over
B blocks in our cache.

00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:50.940
And so we can advance
this scan a little bit,

00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:53.560
advance this scan a little
bit, advanced this one,

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:54.700
and go back and forth.

00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:57.845
In any kind of interleaving we
want of those M over B scans,

00:22:57.845 --> 00:22:59.220
some of them could
be read scans.

00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:00.270
Some of them could
be write scans.

00:23:00.270 --> 00:23:01.520
Some of them can go backwards.

00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:03.776
Some of them could go forwards,
a lot of options here.

00:23:03.776 --> 00:23:05.400
And in particular,
you can do something

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:07.860
like given a little
bit less than M

00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:09.840
over be lists of
total size N, you

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:11.070
can merge them all together.

00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:12.870
If they're sorted lists,
you can merge them

00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:17.661
into one sorted list in
optimal N over B time.

00:23:17.661 --> 00:23:20.160
So that's good.

00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:22.480
We'll use that in a moment.

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:23.010
Here

00:23:23.010 --> 00:23:26.610
I have a little bit of
a thought experiment,

00:23:26.610 --> 00:23:30.420
originally by Lars Arge
who will be speaking later.

00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:31.920
You know, is this
really a big deal?

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:34.720
Factor B doesn't sound so big.

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:35.250
Do I care?

00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:37.460
For example, suppose
I'm going to traverse

00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:41.340
a linked list in memory, but
it's actually stored on disk.

00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:43.230
Is it really important
that I sort that list

00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:46.950
and do a scan versus jumping
around random access?

00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:49.650
And this is back
of the envelope,

00:23:49.650 --> 00:23:51.750
just computing what
things ought to be.

00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:54.975
If you have about a gigabyte
of data, a block size of 32

00:23:54.975 --> 00:23:58.770
kilobytes, which is probably on
the small side, a 1 millisecond

00:23:58.770 --> 00:24:02.250
disk access time,
which is really fast,

00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:05.940
usually at least 2
milliseconds, then

00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:10.140
if you do things
in random order,

00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:13.020
on average every access is going
to require a memory transfer.

00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:17.100
That'll take about
70 hours, three days.

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:20.550
But if you do a scan, if
you presorted everything

00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:23.400
and you do a scan, then it
will only take you 32 seconds.

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:28.080
So it's just 8,000 in time
space is a lot bigger than we

00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:29.640
conceptualize.

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:33.060
And it makes things that were
impractical to do, say, daily,

00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:34.750
very practical.

00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:36.649
So that's why we're here.

00:24:36.649 --> 00:24:37.690
Let's do another problem.

00:24:37.690 --> 00:24:38.398
How about search?

00:24:38.398 --> 00:24:40.380
Suppose I have the
items in sorted order,

00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:42.309
and I want to do binary search.

00:24:42.309 --> 00:24:44.100
Well, the right thing
is not binary search,

00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:48.690
but B-way search, so log
base B of N. The plus 1

00:24:48.690 --> 00:24:50.310
is to handle the
case when B equals 1.

00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:52.830
Then you want log base 2.

00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:55.200
So we have our items.

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:58.230
We want to search, first,
why is this the right bound?

00:24:58.230 --> 00:24:59.607
Why is this optimal?

00:24:59.607 --> 00:25:01.440
You can do an information
theoretic argument

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:02.830
in the comparison
model, assuming

00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:04.800
you're just comparing items.

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:06.730
Then whenever you
read in a block--

00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:08.610
if the blocks have
already been sorted,

00:25:08.610 --> 00:25:10.320
you read in some block--

00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:13.440
what you learn from
looking at those B items

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:16.564
is where your query guy, x,
fits among those B items.

00:25:16.564 --> 00:25:18.480
You already know everything
about the B items,

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:19.950
how they relate to each other.

00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:21.180
But you learn where x is.

00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:24.840
So that gives you log of B
plus 1 bits of information,

00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:28.260
because there are B plus
1 places where x could be.

00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:30.300
And you need to figure
out log of N plus 1 bits.

00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:32.740
You want to know where x
fits among all the items.

00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:35.310
And so you divide log of N
plus 1 by log of B plus 1.

00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:39.510
That's log base b
plus 1 of N plus 1.

00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:40.716
So that's the lower bound.

00:25:40.716 --> 00:25:43.090
And the upper bound is, you
probably have guessed by now,

00:25:43.090 --> 00:25:44.130
is a B-tree.

00:25:44.130 --> 00:25:47.130
You just have B items
and the node sort

00:25:47.130 --> 00:25:49.620
of uniformly distributed
through the sorted list.

00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:52.440
And then once you
get those items,

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:54.930
you go to the appropriate
subtree and recurse.

00:25:54.930 --> 00:25:57.930
And the height of such a tree
is log base b plus 1 of N,

00:25:57.930 --> 00:25:59.162
and so it works.

00:25:59.162 --> 00:26:00.870
B-trees have the nice
thing, you can also

00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:03.870
do insertions and deletions
in the same amount of time.

00:26:03.870 --> 00:26:05.730
Though, that's no
longer so optimal.

00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:07.860
For searches, this
is the right answer.

00:26:10.369 --> 00:26:11.910
So, next thing you
might want to do--

00:26:11.910 --> 00:26:13.860
I keep saying,
assume it's sorted--

00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:16.030
I'd really like some
sorted data, please.

00:26:16.030 --> 00:26:19.009
So how do I sort my data?

00:26:19.009 --> 00:26:20.550
I think the Aggarwal
and Vitter paper

00:26:20.550 --> 00:26:26.040
has this fun quote about, today,
one fourth of all computation

00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:27.750
is sorting.

00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:29.820
Some machines are devoted
entirely to sorting.

00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:31.410
It's like the
problem of the day.

00:26:31.410 --> 00:26:32.580
Everyone was sorting.

00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:34.800
I assume people
still sort, but I'm

00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:38.710
guessing it's not the
dominant feature anymore.

00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:39.960
And it's a big deal, you know.

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:41.760
Can I sort within one
day, so that all the

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:45.390
stuff that I learned today
or all the transactions that

00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:48.450
happened today I
could sort them.

00:26:48.450 --> 00:26:51.060
So it turns out the
right answer for sorting

00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:53.520
bound is N over B log
base M over B of N over B.

00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:56.790
If you haven't seen that, it
looks kind of like a big thing.

00:26:56.790 --> 00:27:01.080
But those of us in the know
can recite that in our sleep.

00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:02.490
It comes up all over the place.

00:27:02.490 --> 00:27:04.470
Lots of problems are
as hard as sorting,

00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:07.170
and can be solved in
the sorting bound time.

00:27:07.170 --> 00:27:09.930
To go back to the
problem I was talking

00:27:09.930 --> 00:27:14.820
about with Floyd's model,
the permutation problem,

00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:16.050
I know the permutation.

00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:17.950
I know where things
are supposed to go.

00:27:17.950 --> 00:27:20.580
I just need to move
them there physically.

00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:22.870
Then it's slightly better.

00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:25.680
You have the sorting
bound, which is essentially

00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:26.860
what we had before.

00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:30.120
But in some cases, just doing
the naive thing is better.

00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:33.210
Sometimes it's better to just
take every item and stick it

00:27:33.210 --> 00:27:36.591
where it belongs in
completely random access.

00:27:36.591 --> 00:27:39.090
So you could always do it, of
course, in N memory transfers.

00:27:39.090 --> 00:27:42.030
And sometimes that is slightly
better than the sorting bound,

00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:45.020
because you don't
have the log term.

00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:48.260
And so that is the right
answer to Floyd's problem.

00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:50.900
He got the upper bound right.

00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:52.860
In his case, M over B is 3.

00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:57.350
So this is just log base 2.

00:27:57.350 --> 00:28:01.380
But he missed this one term.

00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:02.360
OK.

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:03.982
So why is the sorting
bound correct?

00:28:03.982 --> 00:28:05.690
I won't go through
the permutation bound.

00:28:05.690 --> 00:28:07.151
The upper bound's clear.

00:28:07.151 --> 00:28:08.900
Information, theoretically,
it's very easy

00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:12.365
to see why you can't do
better than the sorting bound.

00:28:12.365 --> 00:28:14.720
Let's set up a little
bit of ground rules.

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:19.190
Let's suppose that whatever
you have in cache, you sort it.

00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:19.936
Because why not?

00:28:19.936 --> 00:28:21.560
I mean, this is only
going to help you.

00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:23.510
And everything you
do in cache is free.

00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:25.460
So always keep the cache sorted.

00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:29.227
And to clean up the
information that's around,

00:28:29.227 --> 00:28:31.310
I'm going to first do a
pass where I read a block,

00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:34.110
sort the block, stick
it back out, and repeat.

00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:36.290
So each block is presorted.

00:28:36.290 --> 00:28:39.830
So there's no sorting
information inside a block.

00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:42.660
It's all about how blocks
compare to each other here.

00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:45.010
So when I read a block--

00:28:45.010 --> 00:28:47.780
let's say this is my cache,
and a new block comes in here--

00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:51.890
what I learn is where those B
items live among the M items

00:28:51.890 --> 00:28:53.097
that I already had.

00:28:53.097 --> 00:28:54.680
So it's just like
the analysis before,

00:28:54.680 --> 00:29:00.620
except now I'm reading B items
among M instead of one among B.

00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:04.160
And so the number of
possible outcomes for that

00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:06.350
is M plus b choose B.

00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:07.550
So you have M plus B things.

00:29:07.550 --> 00:29:10.490
And there's B of them
that we're saying

00:29:10.490 --> 00:29:14.210
which of the B in the order
came from the new block.

00:29:14.210 --> 00:29:16.340
You take log of that,
and you get basically

00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:20.150
B log M over B bits that
you learn from each step.

00:29:20.150 --> 00:29:22.730
And the total number of
bits we need to learn

00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:24.900
is N log N, as you know.

00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:28.490
But we knew a little bit of
bits from this presorting step.

00:29:28.490 --> 00:29:30.500
This is to clean this
up at the beginning.

00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:35.377
We already knew N log B bits,
because each of those B things

00:29:35.377 --> 00:29:35.960
was presorted.

00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:38.540
So we have B log B per
block each of them.

00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:39.740
There's N over B of them.

00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:42.800
So it's N log B.
So we need to learn

00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:45.650
N log N minus N log B bits.

00:29:45.650 --> 00:29:53.030
And in each step, which is a
log of N over B N log N over B--

00:29:53.030 --> 00:29:55.490
and in each step, we
learn B log M over B.

00:29:55.490 --> 00:29:57.230
So you divide those
two things, and you

00:29:57.230 --> 00:29:58.880
get N over B log
base M over B and N

00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:03.170
over B. It's a good exercise
in log rules and information

00:30:03.170 --> 00:30:03.670
theory.

00:30:03.670 --> 00:30:07.130
But now, you see it's
sort of the obvious bound

00:30:07.130 --> 00:30:11.670
once you check how many bits
you're learning in each step.

00:30:11.670 --> 00:30:12.230
OK.

00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:15.124
How do we achieve this bound?

00:30:15.124 --> 00:30:16.040
What's an upper bound?

00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:18.410
I'm going to show you
two ways to do it.

00:30:18.410 --> 00:30:21.450
The easy one is mergesort.

00:30:21.450 --> 00:30:23.330
To me, the conceptually
easiest is mergesort.

00:30:23.330 --> 00:30:25.790
They're actually
kind of symmetric.

00:30:25.790 --> 00:30:27.604
So you probably know
binary mergesort.

00:30:27.604 --> 00:30:30.020
You take your items, split
them in half, recursively sort,

00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:31.220
merge.

00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:35.180
But we know that we can
merge M over B sorted lists

00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:38.000
in linear time as
well in N over M time.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.602
So instead of doing
binary mergesort

00:30:39.602 --> 00:30:41.060
where we split in
half, we're going

00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:43.970
to split into M over
B equal sized pieces,

00:30:43.970 --> 00:30:46.640
recursively sort them
all, and then merge.

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:49.826
And the recurrence we
get from that, there is--

00:30:49.826 --> 00:30:52.080
did I get this right?

00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:52.580
Yeah.

00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:56.600
There's M over B sub-problems,
each of size a factor of M

00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:59.150
over B smaller than N.

00:30:59.150 --> 00:31:02.490
And then to do the merge,
we pay N over B plus 1.

00:31:02.490 --> 00:31:04.700
That won't end up mattering.

00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:07.250
To make this not matter,
we need to use a base

00:31:07.250 --> 00:31:11.540
case for this recurrence that's
not 1, but B. B will work.

00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:14.634
You could also do M, but
it doesn't really help you.

00:31:14.634 --> 00:31:16.550
Once we get down to a
single block, of course,

00:31:16.550 --> 00:31:18.580
we can sort in constant time.

00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:22.089
We read it and sort
it, write it back out.

00:31:22.089 --> 00:31:23.630
So you want to solve
this recurrence.

00:31:23.630 --> 00:31:25.880
Easy way is to draw
a recursion tree.

00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:28.400
At the root, you have
a problem of size N.

00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:30.830
We're paying N
over B to solve it.

00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:33.830
We have branching factor M
over B. And at the leaves,

00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:37.950
we have problems with size B.
Each of them has constant cost.

00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:41.570
I'm removing the big Os to
make this diagram both more

00:31:41.570 --> 00:31:42.980
legible and more correct.

00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:45.740
Because you can't use big Os
when you're using dot dot dot.

00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:47.810
So no big Os for you.

00:31:47.810 --> 00:31:49.410
So then use sum
these level by level,

00:31:49.410 --> 00:31:51.680
and you see we have
conservation of mass.

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:53.630
We have N things here.

00:31:53.630 --> 00:31:54.740
We still have N things.

00:31:54.740 --> 00:31:55.948
They just got distributed up.

00:31:55.948 --> 00:31:58.250
They're all being
divided by B linearity.

00:31:58.250 --> 00:32:00.662
You get N over B at every
level, including the leaves.

00:32:00.662 --> 00:32:02.120
Leaves you have to
check specially.

00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:03.770
But there are indeed
N over B leaves,

00:32:03.770 --> 00:32:06.380
because we stop
when we get to B.

00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:07.190
So you add this up.

00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:09.530
We just need to know how
many levels are there.

00:32:09.530 --> 00:32:12.890
One is log base M
over B of N over B.

00:32:12.890 --> 00:32:16.160
Because there's N over B leaves
branching factor M over B.

00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:19.490
So you multiply, done, easy.

00:32:19.490 --> 00:32:21.890
So mergesort is pretty cool.

00:32:21.890 --> 00:32:23.525
And this works really
well in practice.

00:32:23.525 --> 00:32:28.100
It revolutionized the
world of sorting in 1988.

00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:32.180
Here's a different approach, the
inverse, more like quicksort,

00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:34.430
the one that you know is
guaranteed to run [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:36.410
log N usually.

00:32:36.410 --> 00:32:37.940
Here, you can't do
binary quicksort.

00:32:37.940 --> 00:32:41.420
You do M over B root M
over B-way quicksort.

00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:46.480
The square root is necessary
just to do step one.

00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:50.150
So step one is I need to split.

00:32:50.150 --> 00:32:53.870
Now, I'm not splitting
my list into chunks.

00:32:53.870 --> 00:32:55.940
In the answer, in
the sorted answer,

00:32:55.940 --> 00:33:00.050
I need to find things that are
evenly spaced in the answer.

00:33:00.050 --> 00:33:01.070
That's the hard part.

00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:03.349
Then, usually, you find
the median to do this.

00:33:03.349 --> 00:33:05.390
But now, we have to find
sort of square root of M

00:33:05.390 --> 00:33:08.635
over B median-like elements
spread out through the answer.

00:33:08.635 --> 00:33:11.210
But we don't know the answer,
so it's a little tricky.

00:33:11.210 --> 00:33:13.550
Then once we have those
partition elements,

00:33:13.550 --> 00:33:14.840
we can just do it.

00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:19.067
This is the square root of
M over B-way scan again.

00:33:19.067 --> 00:33:20.150
You scan through the data.

00:33:20.150 --> 00:33:22.910
For each of them, you see how
it compares to the partition

00:33:22.910 --> 00:33:24.110
elements.

00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:25.470
There aren't very many of them.

00:33:25.470 --> 00:33:27.636
And then you write it out
to the corresponding list,

00:33:27.636 --> 00:33:31.240
and you get square root
of M over B plus 1 lists.

00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:33.730
And so that's efficient,
because it's just

00:33:33.730 --> 00:33:35.960
a scan or parallel scans.

00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:38.180
And then you recurse, and
there's no combination.

00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:40.040
There's no merging to do.

00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:41.540
Once you've got
them set up there,

00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:43.350
you recursively sort,
and you're done.

00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:46.790
So the recurrence is exactly
the same as mergesort.

00:33:46.790 --> 00:33:49.070
And the hard part is how do
you do this partitioning?

00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:51.162
And I'll just
quickly sketch that.

00:33:51.162 --> 00:33:53.120
This is probably the most
complicated algorithm

00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:56.330
in these slides.

00:33:56.330 --> 00:33:57.710
I'll tell you the algorithm.

00:33:57.710 --> 00:34:02.990
Exactly why it works is familiar
to if you know the Bloom

00:34:02.990 --> 00:34:07.090
at all, linear time
merging algorithm

00:34:07.090 --> 00:34:09.540
for regular internal memory.

00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:12.600
Here's what we're going to do.

00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:17.513
We're going to read in M items
into our cache, sort them.

00:34:17.513 --> 00:34:19.429
So that's a piece of the
answer in some sense.

00:34:19.429 --> 00:34:21.000
But how it relates
to the answer,

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.360
which subset of the answer
it is, we don't know.

00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:26.840
Sample that piece of
the answer like this.

00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:30.290
Every root M over B
items, take one guy.

00:34:30.290 --> 00:34:32.540
Spit that in an
output of samples.

00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:34.929
Do this over and over
for all the items--

00:34:34.929 --> 00:34:37.699
read in M, sort,
sample, spit out--

00:34:37.699 --> 00:34:39.770
you end up with this many items.

00:34:39.770 --> 00:34:43.167
This is basically a trick
to shrink your input.

00:34:43.167 --> 00:34:45.500
So now, we can do inefficient
things on this many items,

00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:47.690
because there aren't
that many of them.

00:34:47.690 --> 00:34:49.969
So what do we do?

00:34:49.969 --> 00:34:54.500
We just run the regular linear
time selection algorithm

00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:57.590
that you know and love
from algorithms class

00:34:57.590 --> 00:35:02.330
to find the right item.

00:35:02.330 --> 00:35:07.370
So if you were splitting
into four pieces,

00:35:07.370 --> 00:35:10.370
then you'd want the
25%, 50%, and 75%.

00:35:10.370 --> 00:35:12.684
You know how to do each
of those in linear time.

00:35:12.684 --> 00:35:14.100
And it turns out
if you re-analyze

00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:16.040
the regular linear
time selection, indeed,

00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:19.010
it runs in N over B
time in external memory.

00:35:19.010 --> 00:35:21.177
So that's great.

00:35:21.177 --> 00:35:23.510
But now, we're doing this
just repeatedly over and over.

00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:24.860
You find the 25%.

00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:25.670
You find the 50%.

00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:27.450
Each of them, you
spend linear time.

00:35:27.450 --> 00:35:29.300
But you multiply it out.

00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:31.400
You're only finding root
of M over B of them.

00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:35.799
Linear time, it's not N over
B, it's N divided by this mess.

00:35:35.799 --> 00:35:37.340
You multiply them
out, it disappears.

00:35:37.340 --> 00:35:39.860
You end up in
regular linear time,

00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:42.500
N over B. You find a
good set of partitions.

00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:45.041
Why this is a good set
is not totally clear.

00:35:45.041 --> 00:35:46.040
I won't justify it here.

00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:50.170
But it is good, so don't worry.

00:35:50.170 --> 00:35:51.710
OK.

00:35:51.710 --> 00:35:54.230
One embellishment to the
external memory model

00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:59.700
before I go on is to
distinguish not just saying,

00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:01.970
oh, well, every block
is equally good.

00:36:01.970 --> 00:36:04.370
You want to count how
many blocks you read.

00:36:04.370 --> 00:36:06.620
When you read one item,
you get the whole block.

00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:07.934
And you better use that block.

00:36:07.934 --> 00:36:09.350
But you can
furthermore say, well,

00:36:09.350 --> 00:36:11.960
it would be really good if I
read a whole bunch of blocks

00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:12.930
in sequence.

00:36:12.930 --> 00:36:15.650
There are lots of reasons
for this in particular.

00:36:15.650 --> 00:36:17.990
Disks are really good
at sequential access,

00:36:17.990 --> 00:36:19.220
because they're spinning.

00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:21.769
It's very easy to seek to
the thing right after you.

00:36:21.769 --> 00:36:23.810
First of all, it's easy
to read the entire track,

00:36:23.810 --> 00:36:25.018
the whole circle of the desk.

00:36:25.018 --> 00:36:29.110
And it's easy to
move that thing.

00:36:29.110 --> 00:36:31.370
So here's a model
that captures the idea

00:36:31.370 --> 00:36:35.756
that sequential block reads or
writes are better than random.

00:36:35.756 --> 00:36:37.130
So here's the idea
of sequential.

00:36:37.130 --> 00:36:44.600
If you read M items, so you read
M over B blocks in sequence,

00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:47.030
then each of those is considered
to be a sequential memory

00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:47.960
transfer.

00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:51.260
If you break that sequence, then
you're starting a new sequence.

00:36:51.260 --> 00:36:53.540
Or it's just random
access if you don't fall

00:36:53.540 --> 00:36:56.250
into a big block like this.

00:36:56.250 --> 00:36:58.650
So there's a couple of
results in this model.

00:36:58.650 --> 00:37:02.750
One is this harder version
of external memory.

00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:05.180
So one thing is
what about sorting?

00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:06.335
We just covered sorting.

00:37:06.335 --> 00:37:09.320
It turns out those are pretty
random access in the algorithms

00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:10.100
we saw.

00:37:10.100 --> 00:37:15.410
But if you use binary
mergesort, it is sequential.

00:37:15.410 --> 00:37:18.505
As you binary merge,
things are good.

00:37:18.505 --> 00:37:19.880
And that's,
essentially, the best

00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:22.070
you can do, surprisingly,
in this model.

00:37:22.070 --> 00:37:27.650
If you want the number of
random memory transfers

00:37:27.650 --> 00:37:29.900
to be little o of
the sorting bound--

00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:32.300
so you want more than
a constant fraction

00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:35.660
to be sequential--
then you need to use

00:37:35.660 --> 00:37:38.930
at least this much
total memory transfers.

00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:44.390
And so binary mergesort
is optimal in this model,

00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:47.780
assuming you want a reasonable
number of sequential axises.

00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:50.060
And the main point
of this paper was

00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:51.579
to solve suffix-tree
construction

00:37:51.579 --> 00:37:52.370
in external memory.

00:37:52.370 --> 00:37:54.740
And what they prove is
it reduces to sorting,

00:37:54.740 --> 00:37:56.000
essentially, and scans.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.740
And scans are good.

00:37:57.740 --> 00:38:00.170
So you get this
exact same trade-off

00:38:00.170 --> 00:38:04.210
for suffix-tree construction,
fair representation.

00:38:04.210 --> 00:38:08.391
I have to be careful, because so
many authors are in those room.

00:38:08.391 --> 00:38:08.890
Cool.

00:38:08.890 --> 00:38:10.727
So let's move on to
a different model.

00:38:10.727 --> 00:38:12.310
This is a model that
did not catch on.

00:38:12.310 --> 00:38:13.810
But it's fun for
historical reasons

00:38:13.810 --> 00:38:18.070
to see what it was about.

00:38:18.070 --> 00:38:20.960
You can see in here two issues.

00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:23.800
One is, what about a
deeper memory hierarchy?

00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:25.630
Two levels is nice.

00:38:25.630 --> 00:38:28.480
Yeah, in practice, two
levels are all that matter.

00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:31.420
But we should really
understand multiple levels.

00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:33.290
Surely, there's a
clean way to do that.

00:38:33.290 --> 00:38:36.190
And so there are a bunch of
models that try to do this.

00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:38.950
And by the end, we get
something that's reasonable.

00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:43.060
And HMM is probably one of
my favorite weird models.

00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:44.890
It's "particularly simple."

00:38:44.890 --> 00:38:47.670
This is a quote from
their own paper,

00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:48.910
not that they're boastful.

00:38:48.910 --> 00:38:49.870
It is a simple model.

00:38:49.870 --> 00:38:51.850
This is true.

00:38:51.850 --> 00:38:55.390
And it does model, in some
sense, a larger hierarchy.

00:38:55.390 --> 00:38:57.430
But the way it's
phrased initially

00:38:57.430 --> 00:39:01.290
doesn't look like this picture,
but they're equivalent.

00:39:01.290 --> 00:39:02.440
So it's a RAM model.

00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:05.150
So your memory is an array.

00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:09.490
If you want to access position
x in the array, you pay f of x.

00:39:09.490 --> 00:39:12.970
And in the original
definition, that's just log x.

00:39:12.970 --> 00:39:15.670
So what that corresponds to
is the first item is free.

00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:17.110
Second item costs 1.

00:39:17.110 --> 00:39:19.240
The next two items cost 2.

00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:20.800
The next four items cost 3.

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:23.230
The next eight items
cost 4, and so on.

00:39:23.230 --> 00:39:26.470
So it's exactly this
kind of memory hierarchy.

00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:27.820
And you can move items.

00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:28.490
You can copy.

00:39:28.490 --> 00:39:31.180
And you can do all the
things you can do in a RAM.

00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:34.560
So this is a pretty good
model of hierarchical memory.

00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:36.310
It's just a little hard.

00:39:36.310 --> 00:39:39.310
So, originally, they
defined it with log x

00:39:39.310 --> 00:39:42.730
based on this book, which is
the classic reference of VLSI

00:39:42.730 --> 00:39:44.050
at the time by Mead and Conway.

00:39:44.050 --> 00:39:47.380
It sort of revolutionized
teaching VLSI.

00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:49.990
And it has this
particular construction

00:39:49.990 --> 00:39:52.060
of a hierarchical RAM.

00:39:52.060 --> 00:39:54.200
I Don't know if RAMs are
actually built this way.

00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:57.100
But they have a
sketch of how to do it

00:39:57.100 --> 00:40:00.500
that achieves a
logarithmic performance.

00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:05.980
The deeper you are, you pay log.

00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:08.560
The bigger your
space is, you need

00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:11.940
to pay logarithmic to access it.

00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:12.460
OK.

00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:14.650
So here are the results
that they get in this model.

00:40:14.650 --> 00:40:15.816
I'm not going to prove them.

00:40:15.816 --> 00:40:18.970
Because, again, they follow
from the results in some sense.

00:40:18.970 --> 00:40:23.002
But you've got matrix
multiplication, FFT sorting,

00:40:23.002 --> 00:40:25.210
scanning, binary search, a
lot of the usual problems.

00:40:25.210 --> 00:40:31.150
You get kind of weird running
times, log, log, and so on.

00:40:31.150 --> 00:40:33.280
Here, it's a matter of
slow down versus speed

00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:36.864
up, because everything is going
to cost more than constant now.

00:40:36.864 --> 00:40:38.280
So you want to
minimize slowdowns.

00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:39.350
Sometimes you get constant.

00:40:39.350 --> 00:40:41.110
The worst slow down
you can get is log N,

00:40:41.110 --> 00:40:43.180
because everything you
can access in, at most,

00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:44.870
log N time in this model.

00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:49.870
But I would say setting f of
N to be log N doesn't really

00:40:49.870 --> 00:40:51.670
reveal what we care about.

00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:54.580
But in the same paper, they
give a better perspective

00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:56.150
of their own work.

00:40:56.150 --> 00:40:59.290
So they say, well, let's
look at the general case.

00:40:59.290 --> 00:41:00.890
Maybe log x isn't
the right thing.

00:41:00.890 --> 00:41:02.890
Let's look at an
arbitrary f of x.

00:41:02.890 --> 00:41:04.390
Well, you could
write an arbitrary f

00:41:04.390 --> 00:41:08.320
of x as a weighted sum
of threshold functions.

00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:10.300
I want to know is
x bigger than xi.

00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:12.910
If so, I pay wi.

00:41:12.910 --> 00:41:15.989
Well, that is just
like this picture.

00:41:15.989 --> 00:41:17.530
Any function can be
written like that

00:41:17.530 --> 00:41:19.390
if it's a discrete function.

00:41:19.390 --> 00:41:21.530
But you can also think
of it in this form

00:41:21.530 --> 00:41:23.530
if the xi's are sorted.

00:41:23.530 --> 00:41:26.410
After you get beyond
x0 items, you pay w0.

00:41:26.410 --> 00:41:31.010
After you get beyond x1 items
total, you pay w1, and so on.

00:41:31.010 --> 00:41:33.400
So this gives you an
arbitrary memory hierarchy

00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:35.134
even with growing
and shrinking sizes,

00:41:35.134 --> 00:41:36.550
which you'd never
see in practice.

00:41:36.550 --> 00:41:38.810
But this is the general case.

00:41:38.810 --> 00:41:40.630
And we are going to
assume here that f

00:41:40.630 --> 00:41:44.720
is polynomially bounded to make
these functions reasonable.

00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:47.230
So when you double the input,
you only change the output

00:41:47.230 --> 00:41:48.190
by a constant factor.

00:41:51.350 --> 00:41:52.610
OK.

00:41:52.610 --> 00:41:53.110
Fine.

00:41:53.110 --> 00:41:55.060
So we have to solve
this weighted sum.

00:41:55.060 --> 00:41:57.010
But let's just look
at one of these.

00:41:57.010 --> 00:41:59.284
This is kind of the
canonical function.

00:41:59.284 --> 00:42:00.950
The rest is just a
weighted sum of them.

00:42:00.950 --> 00:42:03.074
And if you assume this
polynomial bounded property,

00:42:03.074 --> 00:42:05.860
really it suffices
to look at this.

00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:12.430
So this is called
f sub M. We pay 1

00:42:12.430 --> 00:42:16.970
to access anything beyond
M. And we pay 0 otherwise.

00:42:16.970 --> 00:42:20.230
So they've taken general f
with this deep hierarchy,

00:42:20.230 --> 00:42:26.170
and they've reduced to this
model, the red-blue pebble

00:42:26.170 --> 00:42:28.232
game, which we've already seen.

00:42:28.232 --> 00:42:30.190
I don't know if they
mentioned this explicitly,

00:42:30.190 --> 00:42:32.440
but it's the same model again.

00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:35.350
And that's good, because
a lot of problems-- well,

00:42:35.350 --> 00:42:36.800
they haven't been
solved exactly.

00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:38.674
I would say, now, this
paper is the first one

00:42:38.674 --> 00:42:40.780
to really say, OK,
sorting, what's the best

00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:43.660
way I can sort in this model?

00:42:43.660 --> 00:42:45.030
And they get something.

00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:46.430
Do I have it here?

00:42:46.430 --> 00:42:47.060
Yeah.

00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:49.150
They aim for a
uniform optimality.

00:42:49.150 --> 00:42:51.700
This means there's
one algorithm that

00:42:51.700 --> 00:42:56.170
works optimally for this
threshold function no matter

00:42:56.170 --> 00:42:57.040
what M is.

00:42:57.040 --> 00:42:58.450
The algorithm
doesn't get to know

00:42:58.450 --> 00:43:00.340
M. You might say
the algorithm is

00:43:00.340 --> 00:43:04.800
oblivious to M. Sound familiar?

00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:05.960
So this is a cool idea.

00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:07.880
Of course, it does
not have blocking yet.

00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:10.160
But none of this
model has blocking.

00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:12.160
But they prove that if
you're uniformly optimal,

00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:16.010
if you work in the red-blue
pebble game model for all M

00:43:16.010 --> 00:43:17.810
with one algorithm,
then, in fact, you

00:43:17.810 --> 00:43:20.540
are optimal for all
f of x, which means,

00:43:20.540 --> 00:43:23.840
in particular for the deep
hierarchy, you also work.

00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:27.200
And they achieve tight bounds
for a bunch of problems here.

00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:29.270
You should recognize
all of these bounds

00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:32.030
are now, in some
sense, particular cases

00:43:32.030 --> 00:43:33.950
of the external memory bounds.

00:43:33.950 --> 00:43:35.482
So like sorting, you have this.

00:43:35.482 --> 00:43:37.940
Except there's no B. The B has
disappeared, because there's

00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:38.960
no B in this model.

00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:41.120
But, otherwise, it is N
over B log base M over B

00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:44.030
of N over B and so
on down the line.

00:43:44.030 --> 00:43:47.930
They said, oh, search here is
really bad, because caching

00:43:47.930 --> 00:43:49.310
doesn't really help for search.

00:43:49.310 --> 00:43:50.750
But blocks help for search.

00:43:50.750 --> 00:43:53.270
So when there's no B, these
are exactly the bounds

00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:55.160
you get for external memory.

00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:56.900
So I mean, some of
these were known.

00:43:56.900 --> 00:43:59.240
These were already
known by Hong and Kung,

00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:01.760
because it's the
same special case.

00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:04.379
And then the others followed
from external memory.

00:44:04.379 --> 00:44:05.420
But this is kind of neat.

00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:10.040
They're doing it in a somewhat
stronger sense, because it's

00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:14.000
uniform without knowing
M. So the uniformity

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:16.110
doesn't follow from this.

00:44:16.110 --> 00:44:17.240
But they get uniformity.

00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:20.930
And therefore, it
works for all f.

00:44:20.930 --> 00:44:22.860
OK.

00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:24.402
They had another
fun fact, which will

00:44:24.402 --> 00:44:25.776
look familiar to
those of you who

00:44:25.776 --> 00:44:28.050
know the cache-oblivious
model, which we'll get to.

00:44:28.050 --> 00:44:29.967
They have this
observation that while we

00:44:29.967 --> 00:44:32.550
have these algorithms that are
explicitly moving things around

00:44:32.550 --> 00:44:34.230
in our RAM, it
would be nice if we

00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:37.080
didn't have to write that down
explicitly in the algorithm.

00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:40.650
Could we just use least
recently used replacement,

00:44:40.650 --> 00:44:43.550
so move things forward?

00:44:43.550 --> 00:44:45.900
That works great if
you know what M is.

00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:49.490
Then you say, OK, if I need to
get something from out if here,

00:44:49.490 --> 00:44:50.670
I'll move it over here.

00:44:50.670 --> 00:44:53.190
And whatever was least
recently used, I'll kick out.

00:44:53.190 --> 00:44:55.020
And at this point,
this is just a couple

00:44:55.020 --> 00:44:56.280
of years prior to this paper.

00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:59.910
Sleator and Tarjan did the first
paper on competitive analysis.

00:44:59.910 --> 00:45:02.470
And they proved that
LRU or even first in,

00:45:02.470 --> 00:45:05.310
first out is good in the
sense that if you just

00:45:05.310 --> 00:45:08.330
double the size of your cache--

00:45:08.330 --> 00:45:09.870
oh, I got this backwards.

00:45:09.870 --> 00:45:13.290
TLRU of twice the
cache is, at most,

00:45:13.290 --> 00:45:15.540
TOPT of 1 times the cache.

00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:16.800
So the 2 should be over here.

00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:20.850
Great.

00:45:20.850 --> 00:45:24.180
And assuming you have a
polynomially bounded growth

00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:27.130
function, then this is only
losing a constant factor.

00:45:27.130 --> 00:45:27.630
OK.

00:45:27.630 --> 00:45:28.830
But we don't know what M is.

00:45:28.830 --> 00:45:31.271
This works for the
threshold function f sub m.

00:45:31.271 --> 00:45:33.270
But it doesn't work for
an arbitrary function f,

00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:35.330
or it doesn't work uniformly.

00:45:35.330 --> 00:45:36.700
And we want a uniform solution.

00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:37.830
And they gave one.

00:45:37.830 --> 00:45:39.619
I'll just sketch it here.

00:45:39.619 --> 00:45:41.535
The idea is you have
this arbitrary hierarchy.

00:45:41.535 --> 00:45:42.960
You don't really know.

00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:45.720
I'm going to assume
I do know what f is.

00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:47.600
So this is not uniform.

00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:49.530
It's achieved in
a different way.

00:45:49.530 --> 00:45:52.500
But I'm going to basically
rearrange the structure

00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:55.200
to be roughly
exponential to say, well,

00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:57.390
I'm going to measure
f of x as x increases.

00:45:57.390 --> 00:45:59.714
And whenever f of x
doubles, I'll draw a line.

00:45:59.714 --> 00:46:01.380
These are not where
the real levels are.

00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:02.790
It's just a conceptual thing.

00:46:02.790 --> 00:46:04.980
And then I do LRU
on this structure.

00:46:04.980 --> 00:46:08.100
So if I want to access
something here, I pull it out.

00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:08.940
I stick it in here.

00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:10.920
Whatever is least recently
used gets kicked out here.

00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:12.000
And whatever is
least recently used

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:13.550
gets kicked out
here, here, here.

00:46:13.550 --> 00:46:15.485
And you do a chain of LRUs.

00:46:15.485 --> 00:46:17.610
Then you can prove that is
within a constant factor

00:46:17.610 --> 00:46:21.830
of optimal, but you do
have to pay a startup cost.

00:46:21.830 --> 00:46:24.080
It's similar to move
to front analysis

00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:26.330
from Sleator and Tarjan.

00:46:26.330 --> 00:46:27.200
OK.

00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:30.590
Enough about HMM sort of.

00:46:30.590 --> 00:46:32.740
The next model is called BT.

00:46:32.740 --> 00:46:35.810
It's the same as HMM,
but they add blocks.

00:46:35.810 --> 00:46:39.020
But not the blocks that we know
from computer architecture,

00:46:39.020 --> 00:46:41.030
but a different
kind of block thing.

00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:43.040
It's kind of similar.

00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:45.800
Probably, [INAUDIBLE] constant
factors and not so different.

00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:50.312
So you have the old thing
accessing x costs f of x.

00:46:50.312 --> 00:46:51.770
But, now, you have
a new operation,

00:46:51.770 --> 00:46:53.950
which is I can copy
any interval, which

00:46:53.950 --> 00:46:57.110
would look something like
this, from x minus delta to x.

00:46:57.110 --> 00:47:00.260
And I can copy it to
y minus delta to y.

00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:05.210
And I pay the time to seek
there, f of max of x and y.

00:47:05.210 --> 00:47:06.920
Or you could do f
of x plus f of y.

00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:08.220
It doesn't matter.

00:47:08.220 --> 00:47:09.720
And then you pay plus delta.

00:47:09.720 --> 00:47:12.915
So you can move a big
chunk relatively quickly.

00:47:12.915 --> 00:47:15.290
You just pay once to get there,
and then you can move it.

00:47:15.290 --> 00:47:18.560
This is a lot more
reasonable than HMM.

00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:21.890
But it makes things a lot
messier is the short answer.

00:47:21.890 --> 00:47:24.969
Because-- here's a block move--

00:47:24.969 --> 00:47:26.510
these are the sort
of bounds you get.

00:47:26.510 --> 00:47:28.100
They depend now on f.

00:47:28.100 --> 00:47:31.280
And you don't get the
same kind of uniformity

00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:32.780
as far as I can tell.

00:47:32.780 --> 00:47:35.150
You can't just say,
oh, it works for all f.

00:47:35.150 --> 00:47:39.080
For each of these problems, this
is basically scanning or matrix

00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:40.430
multiplication.

00:47:40.430 --> 00:47:43.460
It doesn't matter much until f
of x gets really big, and then

00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:45.170
something changes.

00:47:45.170 --> 00:47:47.810
You Dot product, you
get log*, log, log, log,

00:47:47.810 --> 00:47:51.950
depending on whether your f
of x is log or subpolynomial

00:47:51.950 --> 00:47:53.450
or linear.

00:47:53.450 --> 00:47:55.130
So I find this kind
of unsatisfying.

00:47:55.130 --> 00:47:59.180
So I'm just going to move
on to MH, which is probably

00:47:59.180 --> 00:48:01.100
the messiest of the models.

00:48:01.100 --> 00:48:04.050
But in some sense, it's the
most realistic of the models.

00:48:04.050 --> 00:48:05.660
Here's the picture
which I would draw

00:48:05.660 --> 00:48:07.960
if someone asked me to draw
a general memory hierarchy.

00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:09.990
I have CPU connects to
this cache for free.

00:48:09.990 --> 00:48:12.140
It has blocks of size B0.

00:48:12.140 --> 00:48:16.250
And to go to the next memory,
it costs me some time, t0.

00:48:16.250 --> 00:48:20.180
And the blocks that I read here
of size B0, I write of size B0.

00:48:20.180 --> 00:48:22.070
So the transfers
here are size B0.

00:48:22.070 --> 00:48:24.030
And one has potentially
a different block size.

00:48:24.030 --> 00:48:26.030
It has a different
cache size, M1.

00:48:26.030 --> 00:48:27.620
And you pay.

00:48:27.620 --> 00:48:30.410
So these blocks are subdivided
into B0 sized blocks,

00:48:30.410 --> 00:48:31.700
which happen here.

00:48:31.700 --> 00:48:34.089
This is a generic multi-level
memory hierarchy picture.

00:48:34.089 --> 00:48:36.380
It's the obvious extension
of the external memory model

00:48:36.380 --> 00:48:38.960
to arbitrarily many levels.

00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:41.660
And to make it so
easy to program,

00:48:41.660 --> 00:48:43.660
all levels can be
transferring at once.

00:48:43.660 --> 00:48:48.500
This is realistic, but
hard to manipulate.

00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:52.610
And they thought, oh,
well, l parameters

00:48:52.610 --> 00:48:54.360
for an l-level
hierarchy is too many.

00:48:54.360 --> 00:48:58.340
So let's reduce it to two
parameters and one function.

00:48:58.340 --> 00:49:00.800
So assume that B [? does
?] grow exponentially,

00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:03.300
that these things grow
roughly the same way.

00:49:03.300 --> 00:49:04.940
with some aspect ratio alpha.

00:49:04.940 --> 00:49:06.260
And then the ti--

00:49:06.260 --> 00:49:08.092
this is the part
that's hard to guess--

00:49:08.092 --> 00:49:09.050
it grows exponentially.

00:49:09.050 --> 00:49:11.450
And then there's some f
of i, which we don't know,

00:49:11.450 --> 00:49:13.070
maybe it's log i.

00:49:13.070 --> 00:49:16.010
And because of that,
this doesn't really

00:49:16.010 --> 00:49:17.420
clean the model enough.

00:49:17.420 --> 00:49:20.600
You get bounds, which,
it's interesting.

00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:23.720
You can say as long as f of
i is, at most, something,

00:49:23.720 --> 00:49:26.120
then we get optimal bounds.

00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:29.190
But sometimes when f of
i grows, things change.

00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:31.280
And it's interesting.

00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:32.870
These algorithms
follow approaches

00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:35.570
that we will see in a
moment, divide and conquer.

00:49:35.570 --> 00:49:39.420
But it's hard to state
what the answers are.

00:49:39.420 --> 00:49:41.636
What's B4?

00:49:41.636 --> 00:49:42.760
I think that's just a typo.

00:49:42.760 --> 00:49:45.530
That should be blank.

00:49:45.530 --> 00:49:48.520
I mean, it's hard to
beat an upper bound of 1.

00:49:48.520 --> 00:49:50.810
It also seems wrong.

00:49:50.810 --> 00:49:53.280
Ignore that row.

00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:53.840
All right.

00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:58.430
Finally, we go to the
cache-oblivious model by Frigo,

00:49:58.430 --> 00:50:01.140
et al. in 1999.

00:50:01.140 --> 00:50:02.430
This is another clean model.

00:50:02.430 --> 00:50:07.000
And this is another of the two
models that really caught on.

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:10.400
It's motivated by all the
models you've just seen.

00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:13.310
And in particular, it picks up
on the other successful model,

00:50:13.310 --> 00:50:15.350
the External Memory
Model and says, OK,

00:50:15.350 --> 00:50:17.750
let's take External Memory
Model, exactly the same cost

00:50:17.750 --> 00:50:18.410
model.

00:50:18.410 --> 00:50:21.325
But suppose your algorithm
doesn't know B or M.

00:50:21.325 --> 00:50:23.450
And we're going to analyze
it in this model knowing

00:50:23.450 --> 00:50:24.230
what B and M is.

00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:26.690
But, really, one algorithm
has to work for all B and M.

00:50:26.690 --> 00:50:30.560
This is uniformity from the--

00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:33.170
I can't even remember
the model names--

00:50:33.170 --> 00:50:36.920
not UMH, but the HMM model.

00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:39.110
So it's taking that
idea, but applying it

00:50:39.110 --> 00:50:41.450
to a model that has blocking.

00:50:44.510 --> 00:50:47.750
So for this to be
meaningful, block transfers

00:50:47.750 --> 00:50:48.650
have to be automatic.

00:50:48.650 --> 00:50:51.174
Because you can't manually
move between here and here.

00:50:51.174 --> 00:50:53.090
In HMM, you could manually
move things around,

00:50:53.090 --> 00:50:55.040
because your memory is
just a sequential thing.

00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:56.570
But now, you don't
know where the cutoff

00:50:56.570 --> 00:50:57.710
is between cache and disks.

00:50:57.710 --> 00:50:59.750
So you can't manually
manage your memory.

00:50:59.750 --> 00:51:02.360
So you have to assume
automatic block replacement.

00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:04.950
But we already know
LRU or FIFOs only going

00:51:04.950 --> 00:51:06.350
to lose a constant factor.

00:51:06.350 --> 00:51:09.560
So that's cool.

00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:12.096
I like this model,
because it's clean.

00:51:12.096 --> 00:51:14.720
Also, in a certain sense, it's
a little hard to formalize this.

00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:17.840
But it works for changing B,
because it works for all B.

00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:20.450
And so you can imagine even
if B is not a uniform thing--

00:51:20.450 --> 00:51:23.830
like the size of tracks
on a disk are varying,

00:51:23.830 --> 00:51:26.500
because circles have
different sizes--

00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:29.230
it probably works
well in that setting.

00:51:29.230 --> 00:51:32.110
It also works if your cache
gets smaller, because you've

00:51:32.110 --> 00:51:34.600
got a competing process.

00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:38.470
It'll just adjust, because
the analysis will work.

00:51:38.470 --> 00:51:40.750
And the other fun thing
is even though you're

00:51:40.750 --> 00:51:43.240
analyzing on a two-level
memory hierarchy,

00:51:43.240 --> 00:51:46.850
it works on an arbitrary memory
hierarchy, this MH thing.

00:51:46.850 --> 00:51:48.850
This is a clean
way to tackle MH.

00:51:48.850 --> 00:51:54.040
You just need a
cache-oblivious solution.

00:51:54.040 --> 00:51:55.450
Cool.

00:51:55.450 --> 00:51:59.070
Because you can
imagine the levels

00:51:59.070 --> 00:52:01.570
to the left of something and
the levels to the right of some

00:52:01.570 --> 00:52:02.130
point.

00:52:02.130 --> 00:52:03.880
And the cache-oblivious
analysis tells you

00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:06.338
that the number of transfers
over this boundary is optimal.

00:52:06.338 --> 00:52:08.540
And if that's true
for every boundary,

00:52:08.540 --> 00:52:10.990
then the overall
thing will be optimal,

00:52:10.990 --> 00:52:15.040
just like for HMM uniformity.

00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:15.670
OK.

00:52:15.670 --> 00:52:17.740
Quickly some techniques
from cache-oblivious.

00:52:17.740 --> 00:52:20.050
I don't have much
time, so I will just

00:52:20.050 --> 00:52:21.220
give you a couple sketches.

00:52:21.220 --> 00:52:23.980
Scanning is one that generalizes
great from external memory.

00:52:23.980 --> 00:52:25.730
Of course, every
cache-oblivious algorithm

00:52:25.730 --> 00:52:27.070
is external memory also.

00:52:27.070 --> 00:52:29.980
So we should first try all the
external memory techniques.

00:52:29.980 --> 00:52:31.210
You can scan.

00:52:31.210 --> 00:52:33.204
You can't really do M
over B parallel scans,

00:52:33.204 --> 00:52:34.870
because you don't
know what M over B is.

00:52:34.870 --> 00:52:36.995
But you can do a constant
number of parallel scans.

00:52:36.995 --> 00:52:40.770
So you could at least
merge two lists.

00:52:40.770 --> 00:52:41.740
OK.

00:52:41.740 --> 00:52:44.980
Searching, so this is the
analog of binary search.

00:52:44.980 --> 00:52:48.987
You'd like to achieve log
base B of N query time.

00:52:48.987 --> 00:52:49.820
And you can do that.

00:52:49.820 --> 00:52:52.940
And this is in Harald
Prokop's master's thesis.

00:52:52.940 --> 00:52:55.900
So the idea is pretty cool.

00:52:55.900 --> 00:53:00.910
You imagine a binary search
tree built on the items.

00:53:00.910 --> 00:53:03.430
We can't do a B-way, because
we don't know what B is.

00:53:03.430 --> 00:53:05.740
But then we cut it
at the middle level,

00:53:05.740 --> 00:53:08.046
recursively store the
top part, and then

00:53:08.046 --> 00:53:09.670
recursively store
all the bottom parts,

00:53:09.670 --> 00:53:11.950
and get root N
chunks of size root

00:53:11.950 --> 00:53:15.610
N. Do that recursively, you get
some kind of lay out like this.

00:53:15.610 --> 00:53:17.290
And it turns out
this works very well.

00:53:17.290 --> 00:53:18.940
Because at some level
of the recursion,

00:53:18.940 --> 00:53:20.705
whatever B is-- it
doesn't know when

00:53:20.705 --> 00:53:21.830
you're doing the recursion.

00:53:21.830 --> 00:53:23.412
But B is something.

00:53:23.412 --> 00:53:25.120
And if you look at
the level of recursion

00:53:25.120 --> 00:53:27.536
where you straddle B here,
these things are size, at most,

00:53:27.536 --> 00:53:30.670
B. And the next level up
is size bigger than B.

00:53:30.670 --> 00:53:34.625
Then you look at a
root to leaf path here.

00:53:34.625 --> 00:53:36.250
It's a matter of how
many of these blue

00:53:36.250 --> 00:53:38.032
triangles do you visit.

00:53:38.032 --> 00:53:39.490
Well, the height
of a blue triangle

00:53:39.490 --> 00:53:41.590
is going to be
around half log B,

00:53:41.590 --> 00:53:44.500
because we're dividing in
half until we hit log B.

00:53:44.500 --> 00:53:47.800
So we might overshoot by a
factor of 2, but that's all.

00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:50.644
And we only have to pay 2
memory transfers to visit these.

00:53:50.644 --> 00:53:52.810
Because we don't know how
it's aligned with a block.

00:53:52.810 --> 00:53:55.520
but at most, it fits
in 2 blocks, certainly.

00:53:55.520 --> 00:53:57.940
It's stored consecutively
by the recursion.

00:53:57.940 --> 00:53:59.230
And so you divide.

00:53:59.230 --> 00:54:00.900
I mean, the height
of this thing,

00:54:00.900 --> 00:54:03.460
it's going to be log
base B of N times 2.

00:54:03.460 --> 00:54:04.250
We pay 2 each.

00:54:04.250 --> 00:54:06.702
So we get an upper bound of 4.

00:54:06.702 --> 00:54:07.660
Not as good as B-trees.

00:54:07.660 --> 00:54:10.270
B-trees get 1 times
log base B of N. Here,

00:54:10.270 --> 00:54:12.484
we get 4 times log base
B of N. This problem has

00:54:12.484 --> 00:54:13.150
been considered.

00:54:13.150 --> 00:54:17.900
The right answer is
log of e plus little o.

00:54:17.900 --> 00:54:18.880
And that is tight.

00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:22.370
You can't do better
than that bound.

00:54:22.370 --> 00:54:24.520
So cache-oblivious
loses a constant factor

00:54:24.520 --> 00:54:27.220
relative to external
memory for that problem.

00:54:27.220 --> 00:54:28.702
You can also make this dynamic.

00:54:28.702 --> 00:54:30.160
This is where a
bunch of us started

00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:33.880
getting involved in this world,
in cache-oblivious world.

00:54:33.880 --> 00:54:39.850
And this is a sketch of one of
the methods, I think this one.

00:54:39.850 --> 00:54:41.314
That's the one I usually teach.

00:54:41.314 --> 00:54:43.480
You might have guessed these
are from lecture notes,

00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:45.700
these handwritten things.

00:54:45.700 --> 00:54:47.300
I'll plug that in in a second.

00:54:47.300 --> 00:54:50.260
So sorting is trickier.

00:54:50.260 --> 00:54:51.760
There is an analog to mergesort.

00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:54.290
There is an analog
to distribution sort.

00:54:54.290 --> 00:54:55.600
They achieve the sorting bound.

00:54:55.600 --> 00:54:58.100
But they do need an assumption,
this tall-cache assumption.

00:54:58.100 --> 00:54:59.850
It's a little different
from the last one.

00:54:59.850 --> 00:55:01.720
This is a stronger
assumption than before.

00:55:01.720 --> 00:55:05.230
It says the cache is taller
than it is wide, roughly,

00:55:05.230 --> 00:55:07.600
up to some epsilon exponent.

00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:11.290
So this is saying M over B
is at least B to the epsilon.

00:55:11.290 --> 00:55:14.000
Most caches have that property,
so it's not that big a deal.

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:15.375
But you can prove
it's necessary.

00:55:15.375 --> 00:55:17.980
If you don't have it, you can't
achieve the sorting bound.

00:55:17.980 --> 00:55:20.320
You could also prove you cannot
achieve the permutation bound,

00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:21.569
because you can't do that min.

00:55:21.569 --> 00:55:26.170
You don't know which
is better, same paper.

00:55:26.170 --> 00:55:28.770
Finally, I wanted
to plug this class.

00:55:28.770 --> 00:55:31.420
It just got released
if you're interested.

00:55:31.420 --> 00:55:32.810
It's advanced data structures.

00:55:32.810 --> 00:55:35.602
There's video lectures
for free streaming online.

00:55:35.602 --> 00:55:37.810
There are three lectures
about cache-oblivious stuff,

00:55:37.810 --> 00:55:39.510
mostly on the data
structure side, because it's

00:55:39.510 --> 00:55:40.490
a data structures class.

00:55:40.490 --> 00:55:42.323
But if you're interested
in data structures,

00:55:42.323 --> 00:55:43.900
you should check it out.

00:55:43.900 --> 00:55:47.025
That is the end of my
summary of a zillion models.

00:55:47.025 --> 00:55:48.525
The ones to keep
in mind, of course,

00:55:48.525 --> 00:55:49.930
are external memory
and cache-oblivious.

00:55:49.930 --> 00:55:51.221
But the others are kind of fun.

00:55:51.221 --> 00:55:54.550
And you really see the
genesis of how this was

00:55:54.550 --> 00:55:56.170
the union of these two models.

00:55:56.170 --> 00:55:58.660
And this was sort of the
culmination of this effort

00:55:58.660 --> 00:56:02.170
to do multilevel in a clean way.

00:56:02.170 --> 00:56:05.380
So I learned a lot looking
at all these papers.

00:56:05.380 --> 00:56:06.410
Hope you enjoyed it.

00:56:06.410 --> 00:56:07.045
Thanks.

00:56:07.045 --> 00:56:11.005
[APPLAUSE]

00:56:11.005 --> 00:56:13.480
PROFESSOR: Are
there any questions?

00:56:13.480 --> 00:56:17.440
AUDIENCE: So all these are
order of magnitude bounds

00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:20.424
I'm wondering about
the constant factors.

00:56:20.424 --> 00:56:22.090
ERIK DEMAINE: Are you
guys going to talk

00:56:22.090 --> 00:56:23.920
about that in your final talk?

00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:28.370
Or who knows?

00:56:28.370 --> 00:56:31.780
Or Lars maybe also?

00:56:31.780 --> 00:56:33.490
Some of these papers
even evaluated

00:56:33.490 --> 00:56:36.790
that, especially these guys
that had the messy models.

00:56:36.790 --> 00:56:39.370
They were getting the
parameters of, at that time,

00:56:39.370 --> 00:56:41.890
[INAUDIBLE] 6,000 processor,
which is something I've

00:56:41.890 --> 00:56:44.830
actually used, so not so old.

00:56:44.830 --> 00:56:49.830
And they got very good
matching even at that point.

00:56:49.830 --> 00:56:54.100
I'd say external memory does
very good for modeling disk.

00:56:54.100 --> 00:56:56.830
I don't know if people
use it a lot for cache.

00:56:56.830 --> 00:56:58.420
No, I'm told.

00:56:58.420 --> 00:57:04.010
Cache-oblivious, it's a
little harder to measure.

00:57:04.010 --> 00:57:06.370
Because you're not trying
to tune to specific things.

00:57:06.370 --> 00:57:10.190
But in practice, it seems to
do very well for many problems.

00:57:10.190 --> 00:57:11.507
That's the short answer.

00:57:11.507 --> 00:57:13.006
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
it runs faster

00:57:13.006 --> 00:57:15.940
than [INAUDIBLE] cache aware.

00:57:15.940 --> 00:57:17.260
ERIK DEMAINE: Yeah.

00:57:17.260 --> 00:57:19.060
It does better than
our analysis said

00:57:19.060 --> 00:57:21.880
it should do in some sense,
because it's so flexible.

00:57:21.880 --> 00:57:23.710
And the reality is very messy.

00:57:23.710 --> 00:57:26.020
In reality, M is
changing, because there's

00:57:26.020 --> 00:57:29.710
all sorts of processes
doing useless work.

00:57:29.710 --> 00:57:31.780
And cache-oblivious
will adjust to that.

00:57:31.780 --> 00:57:35.069
And it's especially the
case in internal memory,

00:57:35.069 --> 00:57:35.860
in the cache world.

00:57:35.860 --> 00:57:38.770
Things are very messy and fussy.

00:57:38.770 --> 00:57:40.810
And the nice thing
about cache-oblivious

00:57:40.810 --> 00:57:42.560
is because you're not
specifically tuning,

00:57:42.560 --> 00:57:44.939
you have the potential to
not die when you mess up.

00:57:44.939 --> 00:57:46.397
AUDIENCE: I'd say
that's especially

00:57:46.397 --> 00:57:47.830
the case in the disk world.

00:57:47.830 --> 00:57:49.080
ERIK DEMAINE: Oh, interesting.

00:57:49.080 --> 00:57:50.320
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] But--

00:57:50.320 --> 00:57:51.880
ERIK DEMAINE: These
are the guys who know.

00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:54.171
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] people
have different [INAUDIBLE]

00:57:54.171 --> 00:57:55.150
ERIK DEMAINE: Yeah.

00:57:55.150 --> 00:57:56.184
They're both relevant.

00:57:56.184 --> 00:57:58.040
AUDIENCE: What's the future?

00:57:58.040 --> 00:57:59.462
This is history.

00:57:59.462 --> 00:58:00.170
ERIK DEMAINE: OK.

00:58:00.170 --> 00:58:03.020
Well, for the future, you should
go to the other talks, I guess.

00:58:03.020 --> 00:58:05.600
There's still lots of open
problems in both models.

00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:08.330
External memory, I guess,
graph algorithms and geometry

00:58:08.330 --> 00:58:11.020
are still the main topics
of ongoing research.

00:58:11.020 --> 00:58:13.130
Cache-oblivious is similar.

00:58:13.130 --> 00:58:14.930
At this point, I think--

00:58:14.930 --> 00:58:17.350
well, also geometry
is a big one.

00:58:17.350 --> 00:58:18.950
There's some external
memory results

00:58:18.950 --> 00:58:24.880
that have not yet been
cache-oblivified in geometry.

00:58:24.880 --> 00:58:25.931
AUDIENCE: Multicore.

00:58:25.931 --> 00:58:26.930
ERIK DEMAINE: Multicore.

00:58:26.930 --> 00:58:28.304
Oh, yeah, I forgot
to say I'm not

00:58:28.304 --> 00:58:31.327
going to talk about
parallel models here.

00:58:31.327 --> 00:58:32.660
Partly, because of lack of time.

00:58:32.660 --> 00:58:35.930
Also, that's probably
the most active--

00:58:35.930 --> 00:58:39.260
it's an interesting active
area of research, something

00:58:39.260 --> 00:58:42.830
I'm interested in particular.

00:58:42.830 --> 00:58:45.350
There are some results about
parallel cache-oblivious.

00:58:45.350 --> 00:58:49.460
And all of these papers
actually had parallelism.

00:58:49.460 --> 00:58:53.084
These had parallelism
in a single disk.

00:58:53.084 --> 00:58:55.000
There's another model
that has multiple disks.

00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:56.458
Those behave more
or less the same.

00:58:56.458 --> 00:58:58.759
You basically divide
everything by p.

00:58:58.759 --> 00:59:00.800
These models also tried
to introduce parallelism.

00:59:00.800 --> 00:59:04.130
Or there's a follow up
to UMH by these guys.

00:59:04.130 --> 00:59:06.680
So there is work
on parallel, but I

00:59:06.680 --> 00:59:08.750
think multicore or
cache-oblivious is probably

00:59:08.750 --> 00:59:11.044
the most exciting unknown
or still in progress stuff.

00:59:11.044 --> 00:59:12.460
AUDIENCE: Thank
the speaker again.

00:59:12.460 --> 00:59:13.360
ERIK DEMAINE: Thanks.

00:59:13.360 --> 00:59:17.910
