00:00:21.056 --> 00:00:25.280
ERIK DEMAINE: Welcome to 6.851
Advanced Data Structures.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.420
I am Erik Demaine.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.170
You can call me Erik.

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.600
We have two TAs, Tom
Morgan and Justin Zhang.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.900
Tom's back there.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.260
Justin is late.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.600
And this class is
about all kinds

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.567
of very cool data structures.

00:00:40.567 --> 00:00:42.650
You should have already
seen basic data structures

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.200
like balance binary
search trees and things

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.140
like that, log n
time to do wherever

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.060
you want in one dimension.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.310
And here we're going to turn
all those data structures

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.143
on their head and
consider them in all sorts

00:00:54.143 --> 00:00:56.930
of different models and
additional cool problems.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.630
Today we're going to talk about
time travel or temporal data

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.770
structures, where
you're manipulating time

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.510
as any good time
traveler should.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.940
Then we'll do geometry where
we have higher dimensional

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.620
data, more than one dimension.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.120
Then we'll look at
a problem called

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.900
dynamic optimality, which is,
is there one best binary search

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.642
tree that rules them all?

00:01:16.642 --> 00:01:19.100
Then we'll look at something
called memory hierarchy, which

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.580
is a way to model more realistic
computers which have cache

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.560
and then more cache
and then main memory

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.630
and then dish and all
these different levels.

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.580
How do you optimize for that?

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.770
Hashing is probably the most
famous, and most popular,

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.670
most used data structure
in computer science.

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.960
We'll do a little bit on that.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.050
Integers, when you know that
your data is integers and not

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.147
just arbitrary black boxes that
you can compare or do whatever,

00:01:42.147 --> 00:01:43.730
you can do a lot
better with integers.

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:45.140
You usually beat log n time.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.100
Often you can get constant time.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.130
For example, if you want
to do priority queues,

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.800
you can do square
root log log n time.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.100
That's the best
known randomized.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.010
Dynamic graphs, you have
a graph you want to store,

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.440
and the edges are being added
and maybe deleted, like you're

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:02.690
representing a social network.

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.040
And people are friending
and de-friending.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.081
You want to maintain some
interesting information

00:02:06.081 --> 00:02:07.760
about that graph.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.669
Strings, you have
a piece of text,

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:12.555
such as the entire
worldwide web.

00:02:12.555 --> 00:02:14.180
And you want to search
for a substring.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.540
How do you do that efficiently?

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.420
It's sort of the Google problem.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.540
Or you searching through
DNA for patterns, whenever.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.350
And finally succinct
data structures,

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.170
which is all about
taking what we normally

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.660
consider optimal
space or n space

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.440
and reducing it down to the very
bare minimum of bits of space.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.745
Usually if you want
to store something

00:02:32.745 --> 00:02:34.370
where there's 2 to
the n possibilities,

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.620
you want to get away
with n bits of space,

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.030
maybe plus square root of
n or something very tiny.

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.740
So that's the sync
data structures.

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.790
So that's an overview
of the entire class.

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.970
And these are sort of the
sections we'll be following.

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.930
Let me give you a quick
administrative overview

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.350
of what we're doing.

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:55.520
Requirements for the class--

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.317
I guess, first,
attending lecture.

00:02:58.317 --> 00:02:59.900
Obviously if you
don't attend lecture,

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:00.983
there'll be videos online.

00:03:00.983 --> 00:03:02.810
So that's resolvable.

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.000
But let me know if you're
not going to make it.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.410
We're going to have problems
sets roughly every week.

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.390
If you're taking the
class for credit,

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.500
they have a very simple rule
of one page in, one page out.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.290
This is more constraint on
us to write problems that

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:16.719
have easy or short answers.

00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:18.260
You probably need
to think about them

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.410
a little bit before they're
transparent, but then easy

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.060
to write up.

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.430
And then scribing lectures--
so we have a scribe for today,

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:27.580
I hope.

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:28.550
Here?

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.170
Yes, good.

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.210
So most of the
lectures have already

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:34.580
been scribed in some
version, and your goal

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.420
is to revise that scribe
notes that if you don't like

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.110
handwritten notes, which
are also online, then easier

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:44.320
for people to read.

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.160
Let's see.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.187
Listeners welcome.

00:03:46.187 --> 00:03:48.020
We're going to have an
open problem session.

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:49.230
I really like open problems.

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:50.730
I really like solving
open problems.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.540
So we've done this every time
this class has been offered.

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.790
So if you're interested in
also solving open problems,

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:56.910
it's optional.

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.480
I will organize-- in
a couple of weeks,

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.110
we'll have a weekly
open problem session

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.440
and try to solve
all the things that

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.080
push the frontier of
advanced data structures.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.810
So in classes, we'll see
the state of the art.

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.671
And then we'll change the state
of the art in those sessions.

00:04:15.671 --> 00:04:16.420
I think that's it.

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.920
Any questions about
the class before we

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.089
get into the fun stuff?

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:23.900
All right.

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.142
Let's do some time traveling.

00:04:27.142 --> 00:04:28.850
Before I get to time
traveling, though, I

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.420
need to define our
model of computation.

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:35.716
A theme in this class is that
the model of computation you're

00:04:35.716 --> 00:04:36.590
working with matters.

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.060
Models matter.

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.430
And there's lots of different
models of computation.

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:45.890
We'll see a few of the
main ones in this class.

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:48.580
And the starting
point, and the one

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:53.100
we'll be using throughout today,
is called a pointer machine.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:54.485
It's an old one from the '80s.

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.240
And it corresponds to
what you might think about

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.090
if you've done a lot of
object-oriented programming,

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.950
and before that,
structure-oriented programming,

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:05.760
I guess.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.660
So you have a bunch of nodes.

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:13.970
They have some fields in them,
a constant number of fields.

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.610
You can think of these
as objects or strucs

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:20.270
in c It used to be records
back in Pascal days,

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.170
so a lot of the papers
call them records.

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:24.170
You could just have a
constant number of fields.

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:25.300
You could think of
those numbered, labeled.

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.175
It doesn't really matter
because there's only

00:05:27.175 --> 00:05:28.550
a constant number of them.

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:32.240
Each of the fields could be
a pointer to another node,

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.550
could be a null pointer, or
could have some data in it.

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.760
So I'll just assume that
all my data is integers.

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:45.090
You can have a
pointer to yourself.

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:48.440
You can have a pointer over
here, whatever you want.

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:52.640
A pointer machine would
look something like this.

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:55.040
In any moment, this is the
state of the pointer machine.

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:59.300
So you think this as the memory
of your computer storing.

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.210
And then you have
some operations

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:03.660
that you're allowed to do.

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:07.800
That's the computation
part of the model.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.570
You can think of this
as the memory model.

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:13.100
What you're allowed to
do are create nodes.

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.705
You can say something
like, x equals new node.

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:24.990
You can, I don't
know, look at fields.

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:28.070
You can do x equals y.field.

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:33.560
You can set fields,
x.field equals y.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:37.400
You can compute on these
data, so you can add 5 and 7,

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.110
do things like that.

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:40.990
I'm not going to worry about--

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:43.700
I'll just write et cetera.

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:45.680
This is more a model
about how everything's

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.380
organized in memory, not so
much about what you're allowed

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:49.620
to do to the data items.

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:50.870
In this lecture, it
won't matter what

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:52.161
you're doing to the data items.

00:06:52.161 --> 00:06:53.930
We never touch them.

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:56.840
We just copy them around.

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:59.870
So am I missing anything?

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:01.100
Probably.

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:03.950
I guess you could destroy
nodes if you felt like it.

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:06.566
But we won't have
to today, because we

00:07:06.566 --> 00:07:07.940
don't want to
throw anything away

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:09.200
when you're time traveling.

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:10.100
It's too dangerous.

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:18.570
And then the one catch
here is, what are x and y?

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:21.280
There's going to be one
node in this data structure

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:24.184
or in your memory
called the root node.

00:07:24.184 --> 00:07:26.600
And you could think of that
as that's the thing you always

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:27.800
have in your head.

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:29.390
This is like your
cache, if you will.

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:31.348
It's just got a constant
number of things, just

00:07:31.348 --> 00:07:32.470
like any other node.

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:37.490
And x and y are
fields of the root.

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:42.530
So that sort of
ties things down.

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:45.200
You're always working
relative to the root.

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:50.030
But you can look at the data,
basically follow this pointer,

00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:53.040
by looking at the field.

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:55.850
You could set one
of these pointers--

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:58.160
I think I probably need
another operation here,

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:03.936
like x equals y.field1,
field2, that sort of thing,

00:08:03.936 --> 00:08:06.800
and maybe the reverse.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.200
But you can manipulate
all nodes sort

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:10.770
of via the root is the idea.

00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:12.710
You follow pointers,
do whatever.

00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:14.780
So pretty obvious,
slightly annoying

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:16.250
to write down formally.

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:18.710
But that is pointer machine.

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:26.320
And what we're going to
be talking about today

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:28.829
in time travel is
suppose someone

00:08:28.829 --> 00:08:31.120
gives me a pointer machine
data structure, for example,

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:33.510
balanced binary search
tree, linked list.

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:36.030
A lot of data structures,
especially classic data

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:39.192
structures, follow
pointer machine model.

00:08:39.192 --> 00:08:41.400
What we'd like to do is
transform that data structure

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:42.816
or make a new
pointer machine data

00:08:42.816 --> 00:08:45.120
structure that does
extra cool things,

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:47.470
namely travel through time.

00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:53.340
So that's what
we're going to do.

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:57.870
There's two senses of time
travel or temporal data

00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:02.200
structures that we're going
to cover in this class.

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:05.400
The one for today is
called persistence,

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:08.310
where you don't forget
anything, like an elephant.

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:11.471
And the other one
is retroactivity.

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.800
Persistence will be today.

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.260
Retroactivity is next class.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.670
Basically, these correspond
to two models of time travel.

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:24.176
Persistence is the branching
universe time travel model,

00:09:24.176 --> 00:09:25.800
where if you make a
change in the past,

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.350
you get a new universe.

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:29.460
You never destroy old universes.

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:33.255
Retroactivity is more
like Back to the Future,

00:09:33.255 --> 00:09:35.130
when you go back, make
a change, and then you

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:37.920
can return to the present
and see what happened.

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:39.710
This is a lot harder to do.

00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:42.150
And we'll work on
that next class.

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:46.360
Persistence is what
we will do today.

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:48.670
So persistence.

00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:01.810
The general idea of persistence
is to remember everything--

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:05.110
the general goal, I would say.

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:07.360
And by everything, I
mean different versions

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:08.800
of the data structure.

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:11.290
So you're doing data
structures in general.

00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:14.550
We have update operations
and query operations.

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:16.387
We're mainly concerned
about updates here.

00:10:16.387 --> 00:10:18.220
Every time you do an
update, you think of it

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:21.730
as taking a version of the data
structure and making a new one.

00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:23.800
And you never want to
destroy old versions.

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:26.230
So even though an update
like an insert or something

00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:29.230
changes the data structure, we
want to remember that past data

00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:30.770
as well.

00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:34.030
And then let's make
this reasonable.

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:37.791
All data structure operations
are relative to a specified

00:10:37.791 --> 00:10:38.290
version.

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:57.210
So an update makes and
returns a new version.

00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:08.750
So when you do an
insert, you specify

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:10.850
a version of your data
structure and the thing

00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:11.960
you want to insert.

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:13.850
And the output is a new version.

00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:16.550
So then you could insert into
that new version, keep going,

00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:20.210
or maybe go back to the
old version, modify that.

00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:22.450
I haven't said exactly
what's allowed here,

00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:25.460
but this is sort of
the general goal.

00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:30.950
And then there are four
levels of persistence

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:33.020
that you might want to get.

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:37.440
First level is called
partial persistence.

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:38.690
This is the easiest to obtain.

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:47.630
And in partial
persistence, you're

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:55.460
only allowed to update
the latest version, which

00:11:55.460 --> 00:12:01.670
means the versions
are linearly ordered.

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:03.770
This is the easiest
to think about.

00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:09.300
And time travel can easily get
confusing, so start simple.

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:14.780
We have a timeline of
various versions on it.

00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:17.420
This is the latest.

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:19.850
And what we can do is
update that version.

00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:23.750
We'll get a new version, and
then our latest is this one.

00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:27.950
What this allows is looking back
at the past to an old version

00:12:27.950 --> 00:12:29.282
and querying that version.

00:12:29.282 --> 00:12:31.490
So you can still ask questions
about the old version,

00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:33.830
if you want to be able to do
a search on any of these data

00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:34.329
structures.

00:12:34.329 --> 00:12:35.600
But you can't change them.

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:38.180
You can only change the
most recent version.

00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:39.470
So that's nice.

00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:44.690
It's kind of like time
machine on Mac, I guess.

00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:46.970
If you've ever seen the
movie Deja Vu, which is not

00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:48.636
very common, but it's
a good time travel

00:12:48.636 --> 00:12:51.500
movie, in the first half of
the movie, all they can do

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:52.550
is look back at the past.

00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:54.710
Later they discover
that actually they

00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:57.850
have a full persistence model.

00:12:57.850 --> 00:12:59.930
It takes a while
for dramatic effect.

00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:08.750
In full persistence, you can
update anything you want--

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:11.015
so update any version.

00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:24.200
and so then the
versions form a tree.

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:28.460
OK.

00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:30.200
So in this model,
maybe you initially

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:32.420
have a nice line of versions.

00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:34.860
But now if I go back to
this version and update it,

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:37.340
I branch, get a
new version here.

00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:40.400
And then I might keep modifying
that version sometimes.

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:41.660
Any of these guys can branch.

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:47.480
So this is why I call it the
branching universe model, when

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:49.685
you update your branch.

00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:54.380
So no version ever
gets destroyed here.

00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:56.720
Again, you can
query all versions.

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:59.360
But now you can also
update any version.

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:00.710
But you just make a new version.

00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:02.660
It's a totally new world.

00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:04.490
When I update this
version, this version

00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:06.410
knows nothing about all the--

00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:07.940
this doesn't know
about this future.

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:10.890
It's created its own future.

00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:14.310
There's no way to sort of
merge those universes together.

00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:16.910
It's kind of sad.

00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:22.220
That's why we have the
third level of persistence,

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:24.680
which lets us merge timelines.

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:27.940
It's great for lots
of fiction out there.

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:38.360
If you've seen the
old TV show Sliders,

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:40.660
that would be
confluent persistence.

00:14:50.830 --> 00:15:01.790
So confluent persistence,
you can combine two versions

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:03.110
to create a new version.

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:13.720
And in this case, again, you
can't destroy old versions.

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:16.260
In persistence, you
never destroy versions.

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:22.520
So now the versions form a
DAG, directed acyclic graph.

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:24.010
So now we're allowing--

00:15:24.010 --> 00:15:25.520
OK, you make some
changes, whatever.

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:30.274
You branch your universe,
make some changes.

00:15:30.274 --> 00:15:32.440
And now I can say, OK, take
this version of the data

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:35.510
structure and this version
and recombine them.

00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:38.730
Get a new version, and then
maybe make some more changes.

00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:40.654
OK, what does combine mean?

00:15:40.654 --> 00:15:42.320
Well, it depends on
your data structure.

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:44.420
A lot of data structures
have combine operations

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:48.029
like if you have linked lists,
you have two linked lists,

00:15:48.029 --> 00:15:49.070
you can concatenate them.

00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:50.180
That's an easy operation.

00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:51.721
Even if you have
binary search trees,

00:15:51.721 --> 00:15:53.750
you can concatenate
them reasonably easy

00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:56.670
and combine it into one
big binary search tree.

00:15:56.670 --> 00:15:59.060
So if your data structure
has an operation that

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:01.850
takes as input two
data structures,

00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:05.150
then what we're saying is now
it can take two versions, which

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:06.430
is more general.

00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:08.240
So I could take the
same data structure,

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:10.430
make some changes in
one way, separately make

00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:12.138
some changes in a
different way, and then

00:16:12.138 --> 00:16:14.660
try to concatenate them
or do something crazy.

00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:16.550
This is hard to
do, and most of it

00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:19.090
is an open problem
whether it can be done.

00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:21.590
But I'll tell you about it.

00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:24.860
Then there's another level
even more than confluent

00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:26.550
persistence.

00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:30.590
This is hard to interpret
in the time travel world,

00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:32.430
but it would be functional
data structures.

00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:34.130
If you've ever programmed
in a functional programming

00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:36.800
language, it's a little bit
annoying from an algorithm's

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:39.650
perspective, because it
constrains you to work

00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:43.220
in a purely functional world.

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:45.900
You can never modify anything.

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:46.400
OK.

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:49.220
Now, we don't want
to modify versions.

00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:49.830
That's fine.

00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:51.288
But in a functional
data structure,

00:16:51.288 --> 00:16:54.110
you're not allowed to
modify any nodes ever.

00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:55.720
All you can do is
make new notes.

00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:07.317
This is constraining,
and you can't always

00:17:07.317 --> 00:17:09.400
get optimal running times
in the functional world.

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:11.358
But if you can get a
functional data structure,

00:17:11.358 --> 00:17:13.300
you have all these
things, because you

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:14.259
can't destroy anything.

00:17:14.259 --> 00:17:16.216
If you can't destroy
nodes, then in particular,

00:17:16.216 --> 00:17:17.430
you can't destroy versions.

00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:19.930
And all of these things
just work for free.

00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:22.957
And so a bunch of
special cases are known,

00:17:22.957 --> 00:17:24.790
interesting special
cases, like search trees

00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:26.470
you can do in the
functional world.

00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:29.050
And that makes all
of these things easy.

00:17:29.050 --> 00:17:30.790
So the rest of this
lecture is going

00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:34.270
to be general techniques for
doing partial full persistence,

00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:36.250
what we know about
confluent, and what

00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:41.060
we know about functional,
brief overview.

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:44.680
Any questions about those
goals, problem definitions?

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:48.191
Yeah.

00:17:48.191 --> 00:17:50.834
AUDIENCE: I'm still confused
about functional, because--

00:17:50.834 --> 00:17:52.500
ERIK DEMAINE: What
does functional mean?

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:55.260
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:57.680
ERIK DEMAINE: Yeah, I
guess you'll see what--

00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:00.200
functional looks like all
the other things, I agree.

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:02.360
You'll see in a moment
how we actually implement

00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:03.380
partial and persistence.

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:07.490
We're going to be
changing nodes a lot.

00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:10.670
As long as we still
represent the same data

00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:13.040
in the old versions, we
don't have to represent it

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:14.164
in the same way.

00:18:14.164 --> 00:18:15.830
That lets us do things
more efficiently.

00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:17.720
Whereas in functional,
you have to represent

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:19.430
all the old versions
in exactly the way

00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:20.794
you used to represent them.

00:18:20.794 --> 00:18:22.460
Here we can kind of
mangle things around

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:23.585
and it makes things faster.

00:18:23.585 --> 00:18:25.490
Yeah, good question.

00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:29.882
So it seems almost the same,
but it's nodes versus versions.

00:18:29.882 --> 00:18:31.340
I haven't really
defined a version.

00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:34.580
But it's just that all the
queries answer the same way.

00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:38.580
That's what you need
for persistence.

00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:40.780
Other questions?

00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:43.620
All right.

00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:45.811
Well, let's do some
real data structures.

00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:51.310
We start with
partial persistence.

00:18:55.907 --> 00:18:56.740
This is the easiest.

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:02.080
For both partial and
full persistence,

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:06.400
there is the following result.
Any pointer machine data

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:19.660
structure, one catch with a
constant number of pointers

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:22.220
to any node--

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:24.310
so this is constant n degree.

00:19:27.726 --> 00:19:30.017
In a pointer machine, you
always have a constant number

00:19:30.017 --> 00:19:32.540
of pointers out
of a node at most.

00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:34.540
But for this result
to hold, we also

00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:37.280
need a constant number of
pointers into any node.

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:38.806
So this is an extra constraint.

00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:47.320
Can be transformed into
another data structure that

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:53.770
is partially persistent and does
all the things it used to do--

00:19:53.770 --> 00:19:56.362
so I'll just say, can be
made partially persistent.

00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:03.550
You have to pay something, but
you have to pay very little--

00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:12.550
constant amortized
factor overhead,

00:20:12.550 --> 00:20:21.860
multiplicative overhead
and constant amount

00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:30.290
of additive space per change
in the data structure.

00:20:30.290 --> 00:20:33.660
So every time you do a
modification in your pointer

00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:36.260
machine-- you set one of
the fields to something--

00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:37.830
you have to store that forever.

00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:39.980
So, I mean, this is the
best you could hope to do.

00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:43.250
You've got to store
everything that happened.

00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:45.760
You pay a constant
factor overhead, eh.

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:46.670
We're theoreticians.

00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:48.170
That doesn't matter.

00:20:48.170 --> 00:20:50.840
Then you get any data
structure in this world

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:53.270
can be made
partially persistent.

00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:54.026
That's nice.

00:20:54.026 --> 00:20:54.650
Let's prove it.

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:02.140
OK, the idea is pretty simple.

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:06.790
Pointer machines are all
about nodes and fields.

00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:09.820
So we just need to simulate
whatever the data structure is

00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:11.710
doing to those nodes
and fields in a way

00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:13.540
that we don't lose
all the information

00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:17.320
and we can still
search it very quickly.

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:21.190
First idea is to
store back pointers.

00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:24.872
And this is why we need the
constant n degree constraint.

00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:31.075
So if we have a node--

00:21:31.075 --> 00:21:32.610
how do I want to
draw a node here?

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:38.700
So maybe these are the
three fields of the node.

00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:42.930
I want to also store
some back pointers.

00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:48.480
Whenever there is a node
that points to this node,

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:50.670
I want to have a
back pointer that

00:21:50.670 --> 00:21:54.210
points back so I know where
all the pointers came from.

00:21:54.210 --> 00:21:57.600
If there's only p pointers,
then this is fine.

00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:00.960
There'll be p fields here.

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:03.879
So still constant, still in
the pointier machine model.

00:22:03.879 --> 00:22:05.670
OK, I'm going to need
some other stuff too.

00:22:08.670 --> 00:22:11.310
So this is a simple thing,
definitely want this.

00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:13.470
Because if my nodes
ever move around,

00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:15.172
I've got to update
the pointers to them.

00:22:15.172 --> 00:22:16.380
And where are those pointers?

00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:20.030
Well, the back pointers
tell you where they are.

00:22:20.030 --> 00:22:22.410
Nodes will still
be constant size,

00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:25.500
remain in pointer
machine data structure.

00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:26.340
OK.

00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:28.230
That's idea one.

00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:35.080
Idea two is this part.

00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:39.485
This is going to store
something called mods.

00:22:39.485 --> 00:22:44.020
It could stand for something,
but I'll leave it as mods.

00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:56.530
So these are two of the
fields of the data structure.

00:22:56.530 --> 00:23:01.480
Ah, one convenience here
is for back pointers,

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:04.840
I'm only going to store it for
the latest version of the data

00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:05.780
structure.

00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:16.810
Sorry.

00:23:16.810 --> 00:23:19.610
I forgot about that.

00:23:19.610 --> 00:23:21.397
We'll come back to that later.

00:23:21.397 --> 00:23:23.480
And then the idea is to
store these modifications.

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:25.730
How many modifications?

00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:29.610
Let's say up to p, twice p.

00:23:34.835 --> 00:23:38.640
p was the bound on the
n degree of a node.

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:43.870
So I'm going to allow 2p
modifications over here.

00:23:43.870 --> 00:23:45.450
And what's a
modification look like?

00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:50.770
It's going to consist
of three things--

00:23:50.770 --> 00:23:53.700
get them in the right order--

00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:56.850
the version in which
something was changed,

00:23:56.850 --> 00:24:02.830
the field that got changed,
and the value it go changed to.

00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:07.920
So the idea is that these
are the fields here.

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:09.870
We're not going to touch those.

00:24:09.870 --> 00:24:11.784
Once they're set to something--

00:24:11.784 --> 00:24:13.450
or, I mean, whatever
they are initially,

00:24:13.450 --> 00:24:15.370
they will stay that way.

00:24:15.370 --> 00:24:18.420
And so instead of actually
changing things like the data

00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:19.920
structure normally
would, we're just

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:21.810
going to add modifications
here to say, oh,

00:24:21.810 --> 00:24:25.410
well at this time, this field
changed to the value of 5.

00:24:25.410 --> 00:24:27.720
And then later on, it
changed to the value 7.

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:31.380
And then later on, this one
changed to the value 23,

00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:32.320
whatever.

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:36.292
So that's what
they'll look like.

00:24:36.292 --> 00:24:37.500
There's a limit to how many--

00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:40.920
we can only store a constant
number of mods to each node.

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:44.580
And our constant will be 2p.

00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:45.080
OK.

00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:46.220
Those are the
ideas, and now it's

00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:47.761
just a matter of
making this all work

00:24:47.761 --> 00:24:50.510
and analyzing that it's
constant amortized overhead.

00:24:53.260 --> 00:25:06.230
So first thing is if you
want to read a field,

00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:08.090
how would I read a field?

00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:09.020
This is really easy.

00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:15.920
First you look at what the
field is in the node itself.

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:17.831
But then it might
have been changed.

00:25:17.831 --> 00:25:19.580
And so remember when
I say read the field,

00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:21.600
I actually mean while
I'm given some version,

00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:24.655
v, I want to know what is the
value of this field at version

00:25:24.655 --> 00:25:28.280
v, because I want to be able
to look at any of the old data

00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:29.630
structures too.

00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:37.370
So this would be at
version v. I just

00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:38.840
look through all
the modifications.

00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:40.923
There's constantly many,
so it takes constant time

00:25:40.923 --> 00:25:43.730
to just flip through them
and say, well, what changes

00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:46.160
have happened up to version v?

00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:56.750
So I look at mods
with version less than

00:25:56.750 --> 00:25:59.450
or equal to v. That will be all
the changes that happened up

00:25:59.450 --> 00:26:00.770
to this point.

00:26:00.770 --> 00:26:02.060
I see, did this field change?

00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:03.710
I look at the latest one.

00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:07.250
That will be how I read
the field of the node, so

00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:08.517
constant time.

00:26:08.517 --> 00:26:10.850
There's lots of ways to make
this efficient in practice.

00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:13.730
But for our purposes,
it doesn't matter.

00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:16.010
It's constant.

00:26:16.010 --> 00:26:18.890
The hard part is how
do you change a field?

00:26:18.890 --> 00:26:22.427
Because there might not be
any room in the mod structure.

00:26:35.850 --> 00:26:44.525
So to modify, say we want to
set node.field equal to x.

00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:52.740
What we do is first
we check, is there

00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:54.270
any space in the mod structure?

00:26:54.270 --> 00:27:03.080
If there's any blank mods,
so if the node is not full,

00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:06.630
we just add a mod.

00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:13.106
So a mod will look
like now field x.

00:27:13.106 --> 00:27:15.810
Just throw that in there.

00:27:15.810 --> 00:27:17.650
Because right at this moment--

00:27:17.650 --> 00:27:19.560
so we maintain a time
counter, just increment

00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:21.930
it ever time we do a change.

00:27:21.930 --> 00:27:23.320
This field changed that value.

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:24.540
So that's the easy case.

00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:29.340
The trouble, of course,
is if the node is full--

00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:31.067
the moment you've
all been waiting for.

00:27:31.067 --> 00:27:33.150
So what we're going to do
here is make a new node.

00:27:33.150 --> 00:27:34.690
We've ran out of space.

00:27:34.690 --> 00:27:36.064
So we need to make a new node.

00:27:36.064 --> 00:27:38.730
We're not going to touch the old
node, just going to let it sit.

00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:40.530
It still maintains all
those old versions.

00:27:40.530 --> 00:27:43.230
Now we want a new node
that represents the latest

00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:44.970
and greatest of this node.

00:27:44.970 --> 00:27:45.490
OK.

00:27:45.490 --> 00:27:47.700
So make a new node.

00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:57.060
I'll call it node prime to
distinguish from node, where

00:27:57.060 --> 00:28:04.705
with all the mods, and this
modification in particular,

00:28:04.705 --> 00:28:05.205
applied.

00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:11.160
OK, so we make a new
version of this node.

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:15.370
It's going to have some
different fields, whatever

00:28:15.370 --> 00:28:18.730
was the latest version
represented by those mods.

00:28:18.730 --> 00:28:20.525
It's still going to
have back pointers,

00:28:20.525 --> 00:28:24.810
so we have to maintain
all those back pointers.

00:28:24.810 --> 00:28:26.400
And now the mod,
initially, is going

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:29.340
to be empty, because we
just applied them all.

00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:32.460
So this new node doesn't
have any recent mods.

00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:34.320
Old node represents
the old versions.

00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:37.935
This node is going to
represent the new versions.

00:28:37.935 --> 00:28:39.420
What's wrong with this picture?

00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:40.770
AUDIENCE: Update pointers.

00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:42.120
ERIK DEMAINE: Update pointers.

00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:43.890
Yeah, there's pointers
to the old version

00:28:43.890 --> 00:28:47.580
of the node, which are fine for
the old versions of the data

00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:48.259
structure.

00:28:48.259 --> 00:28:50.300
But for the latest version
of the data structure,

00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:53.560
this node has moved
to this new location.

00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:56.070
So if there are any old
pointers to that node,

00:28:56.070 --> 00:28:58.440
we've got to update them
in the current version.

00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:00.648
We have to update them to
point to this node instead.

00:29:00.648 --> 00:29:04.060
The old versions are fine, but
the new version is in trouble.

00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:06.120
Other questions or
all the same answer?

00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:06.791
Yeah.

00:29:06.791 --> 00:29:10.719
AUDIENCE: So if you wanted
to read an old version

00:29:10.719 --> 00:29:15.630
but you just have the
new version, [INAUDIBLE]?

00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:16.555
ERIK DEMAINE: OK--

00:29:16.555 --> 00:29:17.430
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:19.180
ERIK DEMAINE: The
question is essentially,

00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:22.059
how do we hold on to versions?

00:29:22.059 --> 00:29:24.600
Essentially, you can think of
a version of the data structure

00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:26.404
as where the root node is.

00:29:26.404 --> 00:29:27.570
That's probably the easiest.

00:29:27.570 --> 00:29:29.528
I mean, in general, we're
representing versions

00:29:29.528 --> 00:29:33.120
by a number, v. But we
always start at the root.

00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:35.077
And so you've given
the data structure,

00:29:35.077 --> 00:29:36.660
which is represented
by the root node.

00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:40.020
And you say, search
for the value 5.

00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:43.289
Is it in this binary
search tree or whatever?

00:29:43.289 --> 00:29:45.330
And then you just start
navigating from the root,

00:29:45.330 --> 00:29:49.560
but you know I'm inversion
a million or whatever.

00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:51.340
I know what version
I'm looking for.

00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:56.040
So you start with the root,
which never changes, let's say.

00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:58.320
And then you follow
pointers that

00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:00.060
essentially tell
you for that version

00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:01.380
where you should be going.

00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:03.780
I guess at the root version,
it's a little trickier.

00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:07.710
You probably want a little array
that says for this version,

00:30:07.710 --> 00:30:08.900
here's the root node.

00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:11.130
But that's a special case.

00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:11.670
Yeah.

00:30:11.670 --> 00:30:13.234
Another question?

00:30:13.234 --> 00:30:15.222
AUDIENCE: So on the
new node that you

00:30:15.222 --> 00:30:19.606
created, the fields that you
copied, you also have to have

00:30:19.606 --> 00:30:20.689
a version for them, right?

00:30:20.689 --> 00:30:22.180
Because [INAUDIBLE]?

00:30:26.670 --> 00:30:27.731
ERIK DEMAINE: These--

00:30:27.731 --> 00:30:30.190
AUDIENCE: Or do you
version the whole node?

00:30:30.190 --> 00:30:32.650
ERIK DEMAINE: Here we're
versioning the whole node.

00:30:32.650 --> 00:30:34.600
The original field
values represent

00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:37.940
what was originally there,
whenever this node was created.

00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:40.250
Then the mods specify what
time the fields change.

00:30:40.250 --> 00:30:44.200
So I don't think
we need times here.

00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:45.326
All right.

00:30:45.326 --> 00:30:47.200
So we've got to update
two kinds of pointers.

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:48.810
There's regular
pointers, which live

00:30:48.810 --> 00:30:52.140
in the fields, which are
things pointing to the node.

00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:53.640
But then there's
also back pointers.

00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:55.909
Because if this is
a pointer to a node,

00:30:55.909 --> 00:30:57.950
then there'll be a back
pointer back to the node.

00:30:57.950 --> 00:31:00.620
And all of those have to change.

00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:03.765
Conveniently, the back
pointers are easy.

00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:13.535
So if they're back
pointers to the node,

00:31:13.535 --> 00:31:14.910
we change them to
the node prime.

00:31:14.910 --> 00:31:16.080
How do we find
the back pointers?

00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:17.621
Well, we just follow
all the pointers

00:31:17.621 --> 00:31:21.330
and then there will be
back pointers there.

00:31:21.330 --> 00:31:23.040
Because I said we're
only maintaining

00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:25.650
backed pointers for
the latest version,

00:31:25.650 --> 00:31:28.299
I don't need to preserve
the old versions

00:31:28.299 --> 00:31:29.340
of those backed pointers.

00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:31.025
So I just go in
and I change them.

00:31:31.025 --> 00:31:33.150
It takes constant time,
because the constant number

00:31:33.150 --> 00:31:35.700
of things I point to, each
one as a back pointer.

00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:37.130
So this is cheap.

00:31:37.130 --> 00:31:39.210
There's no persistence here.

00:31:39.210 --> 00:31:41.940
That's an advantage of
partial persistence.

00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:44.370
The hard part is
updating the pointers

00:31:44.370 --> 00:31:45.684
because those live in fields.

00:31:45.684 --> 00:31:47.850
I need to remember the old
versions of those fields.

00:31:47.850 --> 00:31:49.564
And that we do recursively.

00:31:58.746 --> 00:32:00.120
Because to change
those pointers,

00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:01.170
that's a field update.

00:32:01.170 --> 00:32:02.940
That's something
exactly of this form.

00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:05.970
So that's the same operation
but on a different node.

00:32:05.970 --> 00:32:07.440
So I just do that.

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:08.760
I claim this is good.

00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:11.400
That's the end of the algorithm.

00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:12.540
Now we need to analyze it.

00:32:24.886 --> 00:32:25.760
How do we analyze it?

00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:26.260
Any guesses?

00:32:29.498 --> 00:32:30.500
AUDIENCE: Amortize it.

00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:32.208
ERIK DEMAINE: Amortized
analysis, exactly

00:32:32.208 --> 00:32:33.620
the answer I was looking for.

00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:34.580
OK.

00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:36.290
[INAUDIBLE] amortization.

00:32:36.290 --> 00:32:38.330
The most powerful
technique in amortization

00:32:38.330 --> 00:32:40.460
is probably the
potential method.

00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:42.370
So we're going to use that.

00:32:42.370 --> 00:32:44.360
There's a sort of more--

00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:47.990
you'll see a charging
argument in a moment.

00:32:50.914 --> 00:32:53.330
We want the potential function
to represent when this data

00:32:53.330 --> 00:32:55.300
structure is in a bad state.

00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:58.807
Intuitively, it's in a bad state
when a lot of nodes are full.

00:32:58.807 --> 00:33:00.890
Because then as soon as
you make a change in them,

00:33:00.890 --> 00:33:03.680
they will burst, and you have
to do all this crazy recursion

00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:04.580
and stuff.

00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:05.990
This case is nice and cheap.

00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:08.680
We just add a modification,
constant time.

00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:10.430
This case, not so nice
because we recurse.

00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:12.740
And then that's going
to cause more recursions

00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:16.040
and all sorts of
chaos could happen.

00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:20.030
So there's probably a few
different potential functions

00:33:20.030 --> 00:33:21.080
that would work here.

00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:23.150
And an old version
of these nodes I said

00:33:23.150 --> 00:33:25.070
should be the number
of full nodes.

00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:27.680
But I think we can make
life a little bit easier

00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:32.390
by the following.

00:33:32.390 --> 00:33:36.674
Basically, the total
number of modifications--

00:33:36.674 --> 00:33:39.800
not quite the total,
almost the total.

00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:49.760
So I'm going to do c times
the sum of the number of mods

00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:56.190
in latest version nodes.

00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:00.530
OK.

00:34:00.530 --> 00:34:02.984
So because we sort
of really only

00:34:02.984 --> 00:34:05.150
care about-- we're only
changing the latest version,

00:34:05.150 --> 00:34:07.070
so I really only
care about nodes that

00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:08.570
live in the latest version.

00:34:08.570 --> 00:34:09.659
What do I mean by this?

00:34:09.659 --> 00:34:11.909
Well, when I made
this new node prime,

00:34:11.909 --> 00:34:14.000
this becomes the new
representation of that node.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.690
The old version is dead.

00:34:15.690 --> 00:34:18.560
We will never change it again.

00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:21.080
If we're modifying, we will
never even look at it again.

00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:24.805
Because now everything
points to here.

00:34:24.805 --> 00:34:26.429
So I don't really
care about that node.

00:34:26.429 --> 00:34:27.690
It's got a ton of mods.

00:34:27.690 --> 00:34:30.380
But what's nice is that when
I create this new node, now

00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:31.882
the mod list is empty.

00:34:31.882 --> 00:34:33.840
So I start from scratch,
just like reinstalling

00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:34.870
your operating system.

00:34:34.870 --> 00:34:38.010
It's a good feeling.

00:34:38.010 --> 00:34:45.090
And so the potential goes down
by, I guess, c times 2 times p.

00:34:45.090 --> 00:34:49.764
When I do this change, potential
goes down by basically p.

00:34:49.764 --> 00:34:52.230
AUDIENCE: Is c any constant or--

00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:55.440
ERIK DEMAINE: c will be a
constant to be determined.

00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:57.180
I mean, it could be 1.

00:34:57.180 --> 00:34:58.770
It depends how you
want to define it.

00:34:58.770 --> 00:35:02.130
I'm going to use the CLRS
notion of amortized cost, which

00:35:02.130 --> 00:35:06.777
is actual cost plus
change in potential.

00:35:06.777 --> 00:35:08.610
And then I need a
constant here, because I'm

00:35:08.610 --> 00:35:12.850
measuring a running time versus
some combinatorial quantity.

00:35:12.850 --> 00:35:17.410
So this will be to match the
running time that we'll get to.

00:35:17.410 --> 00:35:17.990
OK.

00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:22.290
So what is amortized cost?

00:35:22.290 --> 00:35:24.920
There's sort of two
cases modification.

00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:28.440
There's the cheap case
and the not so cheap case.

00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:30.945
In general, amortized cost--

00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:37.920
in both cases, it's
going to be at most--

00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:39.810
well, first of all, we
do some constant work

00:35:39.810 --> 00:35:44.640
just to figure out all this
stuff, make copies, whatever.

00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:49.680
So that's some constant time.

00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:52.920
That's the part that I don't
want to try to measure.

00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:55.140
Then potentially,
we add a new mod.

00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:59.430
If we add a mod, that
increases the potential by c.

00:35:59.430 --> 00:36:02.070
Because we're just counting
mods, multiplying by c.

00:36:02.070 --> 00:36:04.702
So we might get plus 1 mod.

00:36:04.702 --> 00:36:06.160
This is going to
be an upper bound.

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:09.720
We don't always add 1, but
worst case, we always had 1,

00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:11.880
let's say.

00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:14.220
And then there's
this annoying part.

00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:16.500
And this might happen,
might not happen.

00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:20.340
So then there's a plus maybe.

00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:23.310
If this happens, we
decrease the potential

00:36:23.310 --> 00:36:26.310
because we empty out the
mods for that node in terms

00:36:26.310 --> 00:36:27.720
of the latest version.

00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:34.500
So then we get a negative
2cp, change in potential.

00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:42.120
And then we'd have to pay
I guess up to p recursions.

00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:51.520
Because we have to--

00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:53.360
how many pointers
are there to me?

00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:58.490
Well, at most p of them, because
there are at most p pointers

00:36:58.490 --> 00:36:59.270
to any node.

00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:03.350
OK.

00:37:03.350 --> 00:37:05.110
This is kind of a weird--

00:37:05.110 --> 00:37:06.510
it's not exactly algebra here.

00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:09.736
I have this thing, recursions.

00:37:09.736 --> 00:37:11.610
But if you think about
how this would expand,

00:37:11.610 --> 00:37:13.160
all right, this
is constant time.

00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:14.020
That's good.

00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:15.020
And then if we do this--

00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:16.160
I'll put a question mark here.

00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:16.868
It might be here.

00:37:16.868 --> 00:37:18.110
It might not.

00:37:18.110 --> 00:37:19.820
If it's not here, find constant.

00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:24.280
If it is here, then this gets
expanded into this thing.

00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:26.130
It's a weird way to
write a recurrence.

00:37:26.130 --> 00:37:30.540
But we get p times whatever
is in this right hand side.

00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:31.040
OK.

00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:33.440
But then there's this minus 2cp.

00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:36.560
So we're going to
get p times 2c here.

00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:37.850
That's the initial cost.

00:37:37.850 --> 00:37:40.040
So that will cancel with this.

00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:41.910
And then we might get
another recursion.

00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:43.910
But every time we get a
recursion, all the terms

00:37:43.910 --> 00:37:44.899
cancel.

00:37:44.899 --> 00:37:46.940
So it doesn't matter
whether this is here or not.

00:37:46.940 --> 00:37:49.610
You get 0, which is great.

00:37:49.610 --> 00:37:53.400
And you're left with
the original 2c.

00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:55.410
Constant.

00:37:55.410 --> 00:37:56.300
OK.

00:37:56.300 --> 00:37:59.120
[INAUDIBLE] potential functions
are always a little crazy.

00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:03.530
What's happening here is
that, OK, maybe you add a mod.

00:38:03.530 --> 00:38:05.150
That's cheap.

00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:08.150
But when we have to do this
work and we have to do this

00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:14.390
recursion-- this is up to
2p updates or recursions--

00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:17.270
we are charging it to the
emptying of this node.

00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:21.110
The number of mods
went from 2p down to 0.

00:38:21.110 --> 00:38:22.940
And so we're just
charging this update cost

00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:24.059
to that modification.

00:38:24.059 --> 00:38:26.600
So if you like charging schemes,
this is much more intuitive.

00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:28.500
But with charging schemes,
it's always a little careful.

00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:30.860
You have to make sure
you're not double charging.

00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:34.790
Here it's obvious that
you're not double charging.

00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:37.070
Kind of a cool and magical.

00:38:37.070 --> 00:38:42.010
This is a paper by
Driscoll, Sarnak, Sleator,

00:38:42.010 --> 00:38:43.820
Tarjan from 1989.

00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:45.620
So it's very early
days of amortization.

00:38:45.620 --> 00:38:47.760
But they knew how to do it.

00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:48.521
Question?

00:38:48.521 --> 00:38:50.504
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:50.504 --> 00:38:52.670
ERIK DEMAINE: What happens
if you overflow the root?

00:38:52.670 --> 00:38:54.753
Yeah, I never thought about
the root before today.

00:38:54.753 --> 00:38:57.350
But I think the way
to fix the root is

00:38:57.350 --> 00:39:02.780
just you have one big table
that says, for a given version--

00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:04.326
I guess a simple
way would be to say,

00:39:04.326 --> 00:39:06.200
not only is a version
a number, but it's also

00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:07.130
a pointer to the root.

00:39:07.130 --> 00:39:07.629
There we go.

00:39:07.629 --> 00:39:09.242
Pointer machine.

00:39:09.242 --> 00:39:11.450
So that way you're just
always explicitly maintaining

00:39:11.450 --> 00:39:15.110
the root copy or the pointer.

00:39:15.110 --> 00:39:18.710
Because otherwise,
you're in trouble.

00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:21.530
AUDIENCE: Then can you
go back to [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:21.530 --> 00:39:24.310
ERIK DEMAINE: So in order
to refer to an old version,

00:39:24.310 --> 00:39:26.750
you have to have the
pointer to that root node.

00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:29.336
If you want to do it just
from a version number,

00:39:29.336 --> 00:39:30.460
look at the data structure.

00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:31.450
Just from a version
number, you would

00:39:31.450 --> 00:39:33.249
need some kind of
lookup table, which

00:39:33.249 --> 00:39:34.540
is outside the pointer machine.

00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:36.280
So you could do it
in a real computer,

00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:39.210
but a pointer machine is
not technically allowed.

00:39:39.210 --> 00:39:40.570
So it's slightly awkward.

00:39:40.570 --> 00:39:42.400
No arrays are allowed
in pointer machines,

00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:43.483
in case that wasn't clear.

00:39:43.483 --> 00:39:44.274
Another question?

00:39:44.274 --> 00:39:48.720
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] constant
space to store for [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:54.294
And also, what if we have
really big numbers [INAUDIBLE]?

00:39:54.294 --> 00:39:56.710
ERIK DEMAINE: In this model,
in the pointer machine model,

00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:58.930
we're assuming that whatever
the data is in the items

00:39:58.930 --> 00:40:01.480
take constant space each.

00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:03.670
If you want to know about
bigger things in here,

00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:05.450
then refer to future lectures.

00:40:05.450 --> 00:40:06.910
This is time travel, after all.

00:40:06.910 --> 00:40:09.200
Just go to a future
class and then come back.

00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:11.920
[LAUGHS] So we'll get
there, but right now,

00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:15.121
we're not thinking
about what's in here.

00:40:15.121 --> 00:40:16.870
Whatever big thing
you're trying to store,

00:40:16.870 --> 00:40:19.810
you reduce it down to
constant size things.

00:40:19.810 --> 00:40:22.840
And then you spread them around
nodes of a pointer machine.

00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:25.250
How you do that, that's
up to the data structure.

00:40:25.250 --> 00:40:28.000
We're just transforming the
data structure to be persistent.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.458
OK, you could ask about other
models than pointer machines,

00:40:30.458 --> 00:40:34.530
but we're going to stick
to pointer machines here.

00:40:34.530 --> 00:40:36.220
All right.

00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:38.110
That was partial persistence.

00:40:38.110 --> 00:40:41.540
Let's do full persistence.

00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:42.370
That was too easy.

00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:48.970
Same paper does
full persistence.

00:40:48.970 --> 00:40:50.427
Systems That was just a warm up.

00:40:50.427 --> 00:40:52.510
Full persistence is actually
not that much harder.

00:40:55.070 --> 00:40:57.685
So let me tell you
basically what changes.

00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:05.550
There are two issues.

00:41:05.550 --> 00:41:09.440
One is that everything here
has to change and not by much.

00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:11.370
We're still going to
use back pointers.

00:41:11.370 --> 00:41:12.860
We're still going
to have my mods.

00:41:12.860 --> 00:41:15.026
The number of mods is going
to be slightly different

00:41:15.026 --> 00:41:16.910
but basically the same.

00:41:16.910 --> 00:41:19.327
Back pointers no longer just
refer to the latest version.

00:41:19.327 --> 00:41:21.410
We have to maintain back
pointers in all versions.

00:41:21.410 --> 00:41:22.970
So that's annoying.

00:41:22.970 --> 00:41:24.274
But hey, that's life.

00:41:24.274 --> 00:41:25.940
The amortization, the
potential function

00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:28.190
will change slightly
but basically not much.

00:41:30.850 --> 00:41:33.116
Sort of the bigger issue you
might first wonder about,

00:41:33.116 --> 00:41:35.240
and it's actually the most
challenging technically,

00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:37.490
is versions are
no longer numbers.

00:41:37.490 --> 00:41:39.140
Because it's not a line.

00:41:39.140 --> 00:41:41.247
Versions are nodes in a tree.

00:41:41.247 --> 00:41:42.830
You should probably
call them vertices

00:41:42.830 --> 00:41:45.121
in a tree to distinguish them
from nodes in the pointer

00:41:45.121 --> 00:41:46.580
machine.

00:41:46.580 --> 00:41:48.530
OK, so you've got
this tree of versions.

00:41:48.530 --> 00:41:53.930
And then versions are just
some point on that tree.

00:41:53.930 --> 00:41:57.020
This is annoying
because we like lines.

00:41:57.020 --> 00:41:58.770
We don't like trees as much.

00:41:58.770 --> 00:42:00.770
So what we're going to
do is linearize the tree.

00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:05.900
Like, when in doubt, cheat.

00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:13.880
How do we do this?

00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:15.310
With tree traversal.

00:42:15.310 --> 00:42:18.240
Imagine I'm going to draw
a super complicated tree

00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:19.370
of versions.

00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:21.660
Say there are three versions.

00:42:21.660 --> 00:42:22.807
OK.

00:42:22.807 --> 00:42:24.890
I don't want to number
them, because that would be

00:42:24.890 --> 00:42:26.330
kind of begging the question.

00:42:26.330 --> 00:42:30.530
So let's just call
them x, y, and z.

00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:34.384
All right.

00:42:34.384 --> 00:42:36.050
I mean, it's a directed
tree, because we

00:42:36.050 --> 00:42:37.464
have the older versions.

00:42:37.464 --> 00:42:38.880
This is like the
original version.

00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:39.754
And we made a change.

00:42:39.754 --> 00:42:42.690
We made a different change
on the same version.

00:42:42.690 --> 00:42:45.520
What I'd like to do is a
traversal of that tree,

00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:48.170
like a regular, as if you're
going to sort those nodes.

00:42:48.170 --> 00:42:53.420
Actually, let me use
color, high def here.

00:42:53.420 --> 00:42:55.820
So here's our
traversal of the tree.

00:42:59.030 --> 00:43:01.790
And I want to look at the
first and the last time I

00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:02.730
visit each node.

00:43:02.730 --> 00:43:05.360
So here's the first
time I visit x.

00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:09.250
So I'll write this is
the beginning of x.

00:43:09.250 --> 00:43:13.550
Capital X. Then this is
the first time I visit y,

00:43:13.550 --> 00:43:15.530
so it's beginning of y.

00:43:15.530 --> 00:43:19.070
And then this is the last time
I visit y, so it's the end of y.

00:43:19.070 --> 00:43:20.770
And then, don't care.

00:43:20.770 --> 00:43:24.800
Then this is the beginning of z.

00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:27.230
And this is the end of z.

00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:29.480
And then this is the end x.

00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:38.830
If I write those sequentially,
I get bxbyeybzez,

00:43:38.830 --> 00:43:42.400
because this is so easy, ex.

00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:45.530
OK, you can think of these
as parentheses, right?

00:43:45.530 --> 00:43:48.460
For whatever reason I chose b
and e for beginning and ending,

00:43:48.460 --> 00:43:50.360
but this is like open
parens, close parens.

00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:52.310
This is easy to
do in linear time.

00:43:52.310 --> 00:43:53.690
I think you all know how.

00:43:53.690 --> 00:43:55.066
Except it's not
a static problem.

00:43:55.066 --> 00:43:56.523
Versions are changing
all the time.

00:43:56.523 --> 00:43:57.500
We're adding versions.

00:43:57.500 --> 00:43:59.458
We're never deleting
versions, but we're always

00:43:59.458 --> 00:44:00.422
adding stuff to here.

00:44:00.422 --> 00:44:01.880
It's a little
awkward, but the idea

00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:05.840
is I want to
maintain this order,

00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:16.010
maintain the begin and
the end of each you

00:44:16.010 --> 00:44:17.315
might say subtree of versions.

00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:25.770
This string, from
bx to ex, represents

00:44:25.770 --> 00:44:29.820
all of the stuff in x's
subtree, in the rooted tree

00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:30.660
starting at x.

00:44:33.890 --> 00:44:34.930
How do I maintain that?

00:44:40.550 --> 00:44:42.009
Using a data structure.

00:44:56.490 --> 00:45:00.830
So we're going to use something,
a data structure we haven't yet

00:45:00.830 --> 00:45:02.210
seen.

00:45:02.210 --> 00:45:04.899
It will be in lecture 8.

00:45:04.899 --> 00:45:06.440
This is a time travel
data structure,

00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:10.280
so I'm allowed to do that.

00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:14.150
So order maintenance
data structure.

00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:16.970
You can think of this as
a magical linked list.

00:45:16.970 --> 00:45:19.520
Let me tell you what the
magical linked list can do.

00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:22.871
You can insert--

00:45:22.871 --> 00:45:24.620
I'm going to call it
an item, because node

00:45:24.620 --> 00:45:28.640
would be kind of confusing
given where we are right now.

00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:32.480
You can insert a new item in
the list immediately before

00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:34.850
or after a given item.

00:45:37.410 --> 00:45:37.910
OK.

00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:41.390
This is like a
regular linked list.

00:45:41.390 --> 00:45:44.750
Here's a regular linked list.

00:45:44.750 --> 00:45:48.290
And if I'm given a particular
item like this one,

00:45:48.290 --> 00:45:51.190
I can say, well, insert
a new item right here.

00:45:51.190 --> 00:45:51.721
You say, OK.

00:45:51.721 --> 00:45:52.220
Fine.

00:45:52.220 --> 00:45:57.060
I'll just make a new node and
relink here, relink there.

00:45:57.060 --> 00:45:58.190
Constant time, right?

00:45:58.190 --> 00:46:00.050
So in an order maintenance
data structure,

00:46:00.050 --> 00:46:01.940
you can do this
in constant time.

00:46:01.940 --> 00:46:02.900
Wow!

00:46:02.900 --> 00:46:05.180
So amazing.

00:46:05.180 --> 00:46:08.410
OK, catch is the second
operation you can do.

00:46:08.410 --> 00:46:09.410
Maybe I'll number these.

00:46:09.410 --> 00:46:10.970
This is the update.

00:46:10.970 --> 00:46:13.490
Then there's the query.

00:46:13.490 --> 00:46:17.990
The query is, what
is the relative order

00:46:17.990 --> 00:46:20.360
of two notes, of two items?

00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:27.090
x and y.

00:46:27.090 --> 00:46:29.980
So now I give you this
node and this node.

00:46:29.980 --> 00:46:32.420
And I say, which is to the left?

00:46:32.420 --> 00:46:34.030
Which is earlier in the order?

00:46:34.030 --> 00:46:36.070
I want to know, is x
basically less than y

00:46:36.070 --> 00:46:37.690
in terms of the
order in the list?

00:46:37.690 --> 00:46:41.136
Or is y less than x?

00:46:41.136 --> 00:46:42.760
And an order maintenance
data structure

00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:45.910
can do this in constant time.

00:46:45.910 --> 00:46:50.486
Now it doesn't look like your
mother's linked list, I guess.

00:46:50.486 --> 00:46:52.360
It's not the link list
you learned in school.

00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:54.700
It's a magical linked
list that can somehow

00:46:54.700 --> 00:46:55.810
answer these queries.

00:46:55.810 --> 00:46:56.510
How?

00:46:56.510 --> 00:46:58.770
Go to lecture 7.

00:46:58.770 --> 00:46:59.270
OK.

00:46:59.270 --> 00:47:03.174
Forward reference,
lecture 8, sorry.

00:47:03.174 --> 00:47:05.590
For now, we're just going to
assume that this magical data

00:47:05.590 --> 00:47:06.740
structure exists.

00:47:06.740 --> 00:47:09.340
So in constant
time, this is great.

00:47:09.340 --> 00:47:11.680
Because if we're maintaining
these b's and e's, we

00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:16.090
want to maintain the order
that these things appear in.

00:47:16.090 --> 00:47:17.620
If we want to create
a new version,

00:47:17.620 --> 00:47:20.410
like suppose we were
just creating version z,

00:47:20.410 --> 00:47:23.140
well, it used to be everything
without this bz, ez.

00:47:23.140 --> 00:47:27.215
And we'd just insert two
items in here, bz and ez.

00:47:27.215 --> 00:47:28.590
They're right next
to each other.

00:47:28.590 --> 00:47:30.820
And if we were given version
x, we could just say,

00:47:30.820 --> 00:47:34.300
oh, we'll look at ex and insert
two items right before it.

00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:36.069
Or you can put them
right after bx.

00:47:36.069 --> 00:47:37.610
I mean, there's no
actual order here.

00:47:37.610 --> 00:47:40.690
So it could have been y first
and then z or z first and then

00:47:40.690 --> 00:47:42.070
y.

00:47:42.070 --> 00:47:44.610
So it's really easy to add a
new version in constant time.

00:47:44.610 --> 00:47:47.590
You just do two of
these insert operations.

00:47:47.590 --> 00:47:50.680
And now you have this magical
order operation, which

00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:54.500
if I'm given two versions--

00:47:54.500 --> 00:47:56.800
I don't know, v and w--

00:47:56.800 --> 00:48:00.250
and I want to know is
v an ancestor of w,

00:48:00.250 --> 00:48:02.390
now I can do it
in constant time.

00:48:02.390 --> 00:48:09.700
So this lets me do a third
operation, which is, is version

00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:21.850
v an ancestor of version w?

00:48:21.850 --> 00:48:26.350
Because that's going to
be true if and only if bv

00:48:26.350 --> 00:48:37.195
is an ev nest around bw and ew.

00:48:39.710 --> 00:48:40.290
OK.

00:48:40.290 --> 00:48:41.920
So that's just three tests.

00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:43.980
They're probably not
all even necessary.

00:48:43.980 --> 00:48:45.390
This one always holds.

00:48:45.390 --> 00:48:50.670
But if these guys fit in between
these guys, then you know--

00:48:50.670 --> 00:48:54.810
now, what this tells us,
what we care about here,

00:48:54.810 --> 00:48:58.020
is reading fields.

00:48:58.020 --> 00:49:00.300
When we read a field,
we said, oh, we'll

00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:02.670
apply all the modifications
that apply to version

00:49:02.670 --> 00:49:04.510
v. Before that, that
was a linear order.

00:49:04.510 --> 00:49:06.900
So it's just all versions
less than or equal to v. Now

00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:10.800
it's all versions that are
ancestors of v. Given a mod,

00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:13.830
we need to know, does this
mod apply to my version?

00:49:13.830 --> 00:49:16.560
And now I tell you, I can
do that in constant time

00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:17.610
through magic.

00:49:17.610 --> 00:49:20.340
I just test these
order relations.

00:49:20.340 --> 00:49:24.360
If they hold, then that
mod applies to my version.

00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:27.360
So w's the version
we're testing.

00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:29.430
v is some version in the mod.

00:49:29.430 --> 00:49:32.070
And I want to know, am
descendant of that version?

00:49:32.070 --> 00:49:34.100
If so, the mod applies.

00:49:34.100 --> 00:49:36.630
And I update what the field is.

00:49:36.630 --> 00:49:39.030
I can do all pairwise ancestor
checks and figure out,

00:49:39.030 --> 00:49:43.200
what is the most recent
version in my ancestor history

00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:44.850
that modified a given field?

00:49:44.850 --> 00:49:47.080
That lets me read a
field in constant time.

00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:49.080
Constants are getting
kind of big at this point,

00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:50.040
but it can be done.

00:49:53.270 --> 00:49:54.550
Clear?

00:49:54.550 --> 00:49:56.850
A little bit of
a black box here.

00:49:56.850 --> 00:50:01.920
But now we've gotten
as far as reading.

00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:04.750
And we don't need
to change much else.

00:50:04.750 --> 00:50:11.780
So this is good news

00:50:11.780 --> 00:50:15.280
Maybe I'll give you
a bit of a diff.

00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:26.340
So full persistence,
fully persistent theorem--

00:50:26.340 --> 00:50:27.210
done.

00:50:27.210 --> 00:50:27.710
OK.

00:50:27.710 --> 00:50:30.080
Same theorem just
with full persistence.

00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:31.230
How do we do it?

00:50:31.230 --> 00:50:35.542
We store back pointers
now for all versions.

00:50:35.542 --> 00:50:36.870
It's a little bit annoying.

00:50:36.870 --> 00:50:40.832
But how many mods do we use?

00:50:40.832 --> 00:50:42.540
There's lots of ways
to get this to work,

00:50:42.540 --> 00:50:44.890
but I'm going to
change this number

00:50:44.890 --> 00:50:51.702
to 2 times d plus p plus 1.

00:50:51.702 --> 00:50:56.450
Wait, what's d? d is the
number of fields here.

00:50:56.450 --> 00:50:57.140
OK.

00:50:57.140 --> 00:50:59.150
We said it was
constant number fields.

00:50:59.150 --> 00:51:03.680
I never said what that constant
is. d for out degree, I guess.

00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:09.289
So p is in degree, max in
degree. d is max out degree.

00:51:09.289 --> 00:51:11.330
So just slightly more--
that main reason for this

00:51:11.330 --> 00:51:14.450
is because back pointers now
are treated like everyone else.

00:51:14.450 --> 00:51:17.434
We have to treat both the out
pointers and the in pointers

00:51:17.434 --> 00:51:18.350
as basically the same.

00:51:18.350 --> 00:51:19.880
So instead of p,
we have d plus p.

00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:23.231
And there's a plus
1 just for safety.

00:51:23.231 --> 00:51:28.330
It gets my amortization
to work, hopefully.

00:51:28.330 --> 00:51:29.320
OK.

00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:32.430
Not much else-- this
page is all the same.

00:51:32.430 --> 00:51:35.830
Mods are still, you give
versions, fields, values,

00:51:35.830 --> 00:51:36.620
reading.

00:51:36.620 --> 00:51:41.030
OK, well, this is no longer
less than or equal to v. But

00:51:41.030 --> 00:51:47.060
this is now with a version, sort
of the nearest version, that's

00:51:47.060 --> 00:51:50.660
an ancestor of v.

00:51:50.660 --> 00:51:52.719
That's what we were
just talking about.

00:51:52.719 --> 00:51:54.260
So that can be done
in constant time.

00:51:54.260 --> 00:51:57.400
Check it for all of
them, constant work.

00:51:57.400 --> 00:51:58.130
OK.

00:51:58.130 --> 00:52:00.490
That was the first part.

00:52:04.710 --> 00:52:07.160
Now we get to the hard
part, which is modification.

00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:08.410
This is going to be different.

00:52:08.410 --> 00:52:10.810
Maybe you I should just erase--

00:52:10.810 --> 00:52:13.690
yeah, I think I'll
erase everything,

00:52:13.690 --> 00:52:14.930
except the first clause.

00:52:24.270 --> 00:52:24.890
OK.

00:52:24.890 --> 00:52:26.910
If a node is not
full, we'll just

00:52:26.910 --> 00:52:28.460
add a mod, just like before.

00:52:28.460 --> 00:52:31.040
What changes is
when a node is full.

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:38.220
Here we have to do something
completely different.

00:52:38.220 --> 00:52:38.910
Why?

00:52:38.910 --> 00:52:41.070
Because if we just
make a new version

00:52:41.070 --> 00:52:45.050
of this node that has empty
mods, this one's still full.

00:52:45.050 --> 00:52:48.810
And I can keep modifying
the same version.

00:52:48.810 --> 00:52:52.830
This new node that I just erased
represents some new version.

00:52:52.830 --> 00:52:54.720
But if I keep modifying
an old version, which

00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:57.760
I can do in full persistence,
this node keeps being full.

00:52:57.760 --> 00:53:00.019
And I keep paying
potentially huge cost.

00:53:00.019 --> 00:53:02.310
If all the nodes were full,
and when I make this change

00:53:02.310 --> 00:53:04.764
every node gets
copied, and then I

00:53:04.764 --> 00:53:06.180
make a change to
the same version,

00:53:06.180 --> 00:53:07.388
every node gets copied again.

00:53:07.388 --> 00:53:09.860
This is going to take
linear time per operation.

00:53:09.860 --> 00:53:11.940
So I can't do the old strategy.

00:53:11.940 --> 00:53:15.304
I need to somehow make
this node less full.

00:53:15.304 --> 00:53:17.220
This is where we're
definitely not functional.

00:53:17.220 --> 00:53:19.050
None of this was
functional, but now I'm

00:53:19.050 --> 00:53:24.240
going to change an old node, not
just make a new one in a more

00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:25.860
drastic way.

00:53:25.860 --> 00:53:27.060
Before I was adding a mod.

00:53:27.060 --> 00:53:28.560
That's not a
functional operation.

00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:33.870
Now I'm actually going to remove
mods from a node to rebalance.

00:53:33.870 --> 00:53:43.050
So what I'd like to do is
split the node into two halves.

00:53:43.050 --> 00:53:43.550
OK.

00:53:43.550 --> 00:53:46.295
So I had some big
node that was--

00:53:46.295 --> 00:53:50.190
I'll draw it-- completely full.

00:53:50.190 --> 00:53:52.890
Now I'm going to make two nodes.

00:53:52.890 --> 00:53:53.820
Here we go.

00:53:59.020 --> 00:54:01.030
This one is going
to be half full.

00:54:01.030 --> 00:54:04.930
This one's going to
be half full of mods.

00:54:04.930 --> 00:54:05.460
OK.

00:54:05.460 --> 00:54:08.100
The only question left is, what
do I do with all these things?

00:54:12.150 --> 00:54:14.700
Basically what I'd like
to do is have the--

00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:18.720
on the one hand, I want
to have the old node.

00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:20.550
It's just where it used to be.

00:54:20.550 --> 00:54:23.820
I've just removed half of
the mods, the second half,

00:54:23.820 --> 00:54:25.710
the later half.

00:54:25.710 --> 00:54:26.740
What does that mean?

00:54:26.740 --> 00:54:27.420
I don't know.

00:54:27.420 --> 00:54:29.320
Figure it out.

00:54:29.320 --> 00:54:31.050
It's linearized.

00:54:31.050 --> 00:54:32.710
I haven't thought
deeply about that.

00:54:32.710 --> 00:54:36.300
Now we're going to make a
new node with the second half

00:54:36.300 --> 00:54:36.880
of the mods.

00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:41.640
It's more painful
than I thought.

00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:45.180
In reality, these mods represent
a tree of modifications.

00:54:45.180 --> 00:54:48.450
And what you need to do is
find a partition of that tree

00:54:48.450 --> 00:54:51.000
into two roughly equal halves.

00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:52.870
You can actually do a
one third, 2/3 split.

00:54:52.870 --> 00:54:57.049
That's also in a future lecture,
which whose number I forget.

00:54:57.049 --> 00:54:58.590
So really, you're
splitting this tree

00:54:58.590 --> 00:55:01.440
into two roughly
balanced halves.

00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:03.750
And so this 2 might actually
need to change to a 3,

00:55:03.750 --> 00:55:06.330
but it's a constant.

00:55:06.330 --> 00:55:07.590
OK.

00:55:07.590 --> 00:55:09.330
What I want is for
this to represent

00:55:09.330 --> 00:55:10.350
a subtree of versions.

00:55:10.350 --> 00:55:11.860
Let me draw the picture.

00:55:11.860 --> 00:55:15.180
So here's a tree of versions
represented by the old mods.

00:55:15.180 --> 00:55:18.580
I'd like to cut out a
subtree rooted at some node.

00:55:18.580 --> 00:55:21.540
So let's just assume
for now this has exactly

00:55:21.540 --> 00:55:22.890
half the nodes.

00:55:22.890 --> 00:55:25.470
And this has half the nodes.

00:55:25.470 --> 00:55:29.180
In reality, I think it
can be one third, 2/3.

00:55:29.180 --> 00:55:29.680
OK.

00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:32.930
But let's keep it convenient.

00:55:32.930 --> 00:55:34.750
So I want the new
node to represent

00:55:34.750 --> 00:55:37.630
this subtree and this node
to represent everything else.

00:55:37.630 --> 00:55:41.650
This node is as if this
stuff hasn't happened yet.

00:55:41.650 --> 00:55:44.714
I mean, so it represents all
these old versions that do not,

00:55:44.714 --> 00:55:45.880
that are not in the subtree.

00:55:45.880 --> 00:55:47.800
This represents all
the latest stuff.

00:55:47.800 --> 00:55:49.750
So what I'm going to
do is like before, I

00:55:49.750 --> 00:55:54.090
want to apply some
mods to these fields.

00:55:54.090 --> 00:55:58.320
And whatever minds were
relevant at this point, whatever

00:55:58.320 --> 00:56:02.610
had been applied, I apply
those to the fields here.

00:56:02.610 --> 00:56:06.900
And so that means I can
remove all of these mods.

00:56:06.900 --> 00:56:09.360
I only cared about these ones.

00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:11.220
Update these fields accordingly.

00:56:11.220 --> 00:56:14.040
I still have the other mods to
represent all the other changes

00:56:14.040 --> 00:56:16.030
that could be in that subtree.

00:56:16.030 --> 00:56:16.530
OK.

00:56:16.530 --> 00:56:33.255
So we actually split the tree,
and we apply mods to new nodes.

00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:40.050
Anything else I need to say?

00:56:42.542 --> 00:56:44.000
Oh, now we need to
update pointers.

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:45.124
That's always the fun part.

00:56:49.550 --> 00:56:50.530
Let's go over here.

00:57:05.300 --> 00:57:07.490
So old node hasn't moved.

00:57:07.490 --> 00:57:09.150
But this new node has moved.

00:57:09.150 --> 00:57:13.880
So for all of these
versions, I want

00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:18.020
to change the pointer that
used to point to old node

00:57:18.020 --> 00:57:20.806
should now point to new node.

00:57:20.806 --> 00:57:21.930
In this version, it's fine.

00:57:21.930 --> 00:57:23.150
It should still
point to old node,

00:57:23.150 --> 00:57:25.280
because this represents
all those old versions.

00:57:25.280 --> 00:57:28.170
But for the new version,
that version in the subtree,

00:57:28.170 --> 00:57:30.781
I've got to point here instead.

00:57:30.781 --> 00:57:31.280
OK.

00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:37.330
So how many pointers could
there be to this node

00:57:37.330 --> 00:57:38.850
that need to change.

00:57:38.850 --> 00:57:41.630
That's a tricky part
in this analysis.

00:57:41.630 --> 00:57:45.200
Think about it for a while.

00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:47.200
I mean, in this
new node, whatever

00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:50.222
is pointed to by either here or
here in the new node also has

00:57:50.222 --> 00:57:50.930
a return pointer.

00:57:50.930 --> 00:57:52.130
All pointers are bidirectional.

00:57:52.130 --> 00:57:54.338
So we don't really care
about whether they're forward

00:57:54.338 --> 00:57:54.926
or backward.

00:57:54.926 --> 00:57:56.300
How many pointers
are there here?

00:57:56.300 --> 00:57:59.360
Well, there's d here
and there's p here.

00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:01.280
But then there's also
some additional pointers

00:58:01.280 --> 00:58:02.750
represented over here.

00:58:02.750 --> 00:58:04.100
How many?

00:58:04.100 --> 00:58:06.890
Well, if we assume this
magical 50/50 split,

00:58:06.890 --> 00:58:12.920
there's right now d plus p plus
1 mods over here, half of them.

00:58:12.920 --> 00:58:16.100
Each of them might be a pointer
to some other place, which

00:58:16.100 --> 00:58:18.715
has a return pointer
in that version.

00:58:18.715 --> 00:58:23.690
So number of back pointers
that we need to update

00:58:23.690 --> 00:58:27.150
is going to be this, 2
times d 2 times p plus 1.

00:58:30.700 --> 00:58:41.850
So recursively update at
most 2 times d plus 2 times p

00:58:41.850 --> 00:58:44.840
plus 1 pointers to the node.

00:58:50.270 --> 00:58:52.550
The good news is this is
really only half of them

00:58:52.550 --> 00:58:54.850
or some fraction of them.

00:58:54.850 --> 00:58:57.417
It used to be--

00:58:57.417 --> 00:58:59.000
well, there were
more pointers before.

00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:00.290
We don't have to
deal with these ones.

00:59:00.290 --> 00:59:01.831
That's where we're
saving, and that's

00:59:01.831 --> 00:59:03.622
why this amortization works.

00:59:03.622 --> 00:59:06.080
Let me give you a potential
function that makes this work--

00:59:12.950 --> 00:59:23.760
is minus c times sum of the
number of empty mod slots.

00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:26.370
It's kind of the same
potential but before

00:59:26.370 --> 00:59:28.530
we had this notion of
dead and alive nodes.

00:59:28.530 --> 00:59:30.450
Now everything's alive
because everything

00:59:30.450 --> 00:59:31.980
could change at any moment.

00:59:31.980 --> 00:59:36.030
So instead, I'm going to
measure how much room I have

00:59:36.030 --> 00:59:37.134
in each node.

00:59:37.134 --> 00:59:38.550
Before I had no
room in this node.

00:59:38.550 --> 00:59:41.760
Now I have half the
space in both nodes.

00:59:41.760 --> 00:59:44.070
So that's good news.

00:59:44.070 --> 00:59:48.300
Whenever we have
this recursion, we

00:59:48.300 --> 00:59:56.630
can charge it to a
potential decrease.

00:59:56.630 --> 01:00:01.160
Fee goes down by--

01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:03.720
because I have a
negative sign here--

01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:13.740
c times, oh man, 2 times
d plus p plus 1, I think.

01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:15.780
Because there's d plus
p plus 1 space here,

01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:17.230
d plus p plus 1 space here.

01:00:17.230 --> 01:00:18.990
I mean, we added
one whole new node.

01:00:18.990 --> 01:00:20.820
And total capacity
of a node in mods

01:00:20.820 --> 01:00:23.610
is 2 times d plus p plus 1.

01:00:23.610 --> 01:00:26.010
So we get that times c.

01:00:26.010 --> 01:00:28.530
And this is basically
just enough,

01:00:28.530 --> 01:00:32.010
because this is 2 times
d plus 2 times p plus 2.

01:00:32.010 --> 01:00:34.140
And here we have a plus 1.

01:00:34.140 --> 01:00:39.690
And so the recursion gets
annihilated by 2 times d plus

01:00:39.690 --> 01:00:41.280
2 times p plus 1.

01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:43.440
And then there's one
c left over to absorb

01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:47.241
whatever constant cost there
was to do all this other work.

01:00:47.241 --> 01:00:51.570
So I got the constants
just to work,

01:00:51.570 --> 01:00:54.340
except that I cheated and it's
really a one third, 2/3 split.

01:00:54.340 --> 01:00:57.090
So probably all of these
constants have to change,

01:00:57.090 --> 01:00:58.102
such is life.

01:00:58.102 --> 01:01:01.490
But I think you get the idea.

01:01:01.490 --> 01:01:03.900
Any questions about
full persistence?

01:01:07.110 --> 01:01:10.200
This is fun stuff, time travel.

01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:11.426
Yeah?

01:01:11.426 --> 01:01:14.630
AUDIENCE: So in the first
half of the thing where

01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:16.583
the if, there's room
you can put it in.

01:01:16.583 --> 01:01:17.056
ERIK DEMAINE: Right.

01:01:17.056 --> 01:01:17.919
AUDIENCE: I have a
question about how

01:01:17.919 --> 01:01:19.421
we represent the version.

01:01:19.421 --> 01:01:23.016
Because before when we said
restore now [INAUDIBLE].

01:01:23.016 --> 01:01:25.920
It made more sense if now was
like a timestamp or something.

01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:26.670
ERIK DEMAINE: OK.

01:01:26.670 --> 01:01:31.470
Right, so how do we represent a
version even here or anywhere?

01:01:31.470 --> 01:01:34.230
When we do a modification, an
update, in the data structure,

01:01:34.230 --> 01:01:36.420
we want to return
the new version.

01:01:36.420 --> 01:01:39.810
Basically, we're going
to actually store

01:01:39.810 --> 01:01:41.042
the DAG of versions.

01:01:41.042 --> 01:01:43.250
And a version is going to
be represented by a pointer

01:01:43.250 --> 01:01:44.400
into this DAG.

01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:47.340
One of the nodes in this
DAG becomes a version.

01:01:47.340 --> 01:01:50.400
Every node in this DAG is
going to store a pointer

01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:53.640
to the corresponding b character
and a corresponding e character

01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:56.460
in this data
structure, which then

01:01:56.460 --> 01:01:57.924
lets you do anything you want.

01:01:57.924 --> 01:01:59.590
Then you can query
against that version,

01:01:59.590 --> 01:02:01.690
whether it's an ancestor
of another version.

01:02:01.690 --> 01:02:02.981
So yeah, I didn't mention that.

01:02:02.981 --> 01:02:04.230
Versions are nodes in here.

01:02:04.230 --> 01:02:06.647
Nodes in here have pointers
to the b's and e's.

01:02:06.647 --> 01:02:08.730
And vice versa, the b's
and e's have pointers back

01:02:08.730 --> 01:02:10.731
to the corresponding
version node.

01:02:10.731 --> 01:02:12.480
And then you can keep
track of everything.

01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:14.790
Good question.

01:02:14.790 --> 01:02:15.390
Yeah?

01:02:15.390 --> 01:02:16.270
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] question.

01:02:16.270 --> 01:02:17.150
Remind me what d is in this.

01:02:17.150 --> 01:02:19.108
ERIK DEMAINE: Oh, d was
the maximum out degree.

01:02:19.108 --> 01:02:26.970
It's the number of fields in
a node, as defined right here.

01:02:26.970 --> 01:02:29.701
Other questions?

01:02:29.701 --> 01:02:30.200
Whew.

01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:31.305
OK, a little breather.

01:02:31.305 --> 01:02:33.450
That was partial persistence,
full persistence.

01:02:33.450 --> 01:02:36.730
This is, unfortunately, the
end of the really good results.

01:02:36.730 --> 01:02:38.650
As long as we have
constant degree nodes,

01:02:38.650 --> 01:02:41.320
in and out degree,
we can do all.

01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:44.830
We can do for
persistence for free.

01:02:44.830 --> 01:02:47.080
Obviously there are practical
constants involved here.

01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:53.170
But in theory, you
can do this perfectly.

01:02:53.170 --> 01:02:54.830
Before we go on to
confluence, there

01:02:54.830 --> 01:02:58.210
is one positive result,
which is what if you

01:02:58.210 --> 01:03:00.615
don't like amortize bounds.

01:03:00.615 --> 01:03:02.740
There are various reasons
amortize bounds might not

01:03:02.740 --> 01:03:03.070
be good.

01:03:03.070 --> 01:03:04.861
Maybe you really care
about every operation

01:03:04.861 --> 01:03:08.740
being no slower than it was
except by a constant factor.

01:03:08.740 --> 01:03:11.500
We're amortizing here, so some
operations get really slow.

01:03:11.500 --> 01:03:14.110
But the others are all
fast to compensate.

01:03:14.110 --> 01:03:19.540
You can deamortize, it's called.

01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:30.280
You can get constant
worst case slowdown

01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:31.870
for partial persistence.

01:03:36.770 --> 01:03:44.260
This is a result of Garret
Brodle from the late '90s, '97.

01:03:44.260 --> 01:03:47.149
For full persistence--
so it's an open problem.

01:03:47.149 --> 01:03:48.940
I don't know if people
have worked on that.

01:03:55.801 --> 01:03:56.300
All right.

01:03:56.300 --> 01:03:59.515
So some, mostly good results.

01:03:59.515 --> 01:04:01.640
Let's move on to confluent
persistence where things

01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:03.606
get a lot more challenging.

01:04:17.511 --> 01:04:20.010
Lots of things go out the window
with confluent persistence.

01:04:20.010 --> 01:04:23.520
In particular, your
versions are now a DAG.

01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:25.650
It's a lot harder
to linearize a DAG.

01:04:25.650 --> 01:04:28.980
Trees are not that
far from pads.

01:04:28.980 --> 01:04:33.672
But DAGs are quite far
from pads, unfortunately.

01:04:33.672 --> 01:04:35.130
But that's not all
that goes wrong.

01:04:44.660 --> 01:04:50.060
Let me first tell you the
kind of end effect as a user.

01:04:50.060 --> 01:04:52.060
Imagine you have
a data structure.

01:04:54.830 --> 01:04:57.500
Think of it as a
list, I guess, which

01:04:57.500 --> 01:04:59.330
is a list of characters
in your document.

01:04:59.330 --> 01:05:03.410
You're using vi or Word,
your favorite, whatever.

01:05:03.410 --> 01:05:05.060
It's a text editor.

01:05:05.060 --> 01:05:06.680
You've got a string of words.

01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:09.785
And now you like to do
things like copy and paste.

01:05:09.785 --> 01:05:11.270
It's a nice operation.

01:05:11.270 --> 01:05:16.340
So you select an interval of
the string and you copy it.

01:05:16.340 --> 01:05:18.340
And then you paste
it somewhere else.

01:05:18.340 --> 01:05:21.950
So now you've got two
copies of that string.

01:05:21.950 --> 01:05:24.050
This is, in some
sense, what you might

01:05:24.050 --> 01:05:27.960
call a confluent
operation, because--

01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:30.470
yeah, maybe a cleaner way to
think of it is the following.

01:05:30.470 --> 01:05:31.910
You have your string.

01:05:31.910 --> 01:05:33.950
Now I have an operation,
which is split it.

01:05:33.950 --> 01:05:35.840
So now I have two strings.

01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:36.340
OK.

01:05:36.340 --> 01:05:38.298
And now I have an operation,
which is split it.

01:05:38.298 --> 01:05:40.770
Now I have three strings.

01:05:40.770 --> 01:05:41.270
OK.

01:05:41.270 --> 01:05:44.280
Now I have an operation
which is concatenate.

01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:47.330
So I can, for
example, reconstruct

01:05:47.330 --> 01:05:49.850
the original string-- actually,
I have the original string.

01:05:49.850 --> 01:05:51.940
No biggie.

01:05:51.940 --> 01:05:54.470
Let's say-- because
I have all versions.

01:05:54.470 --> 01:05:55.520
I never lose them.

01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:59.090
So now instead, I'm going to
cut the string here, let's say.

01:05:59.090 --> 01:06:03.710
So now I have this and this.

01:06:03.710 --> 01:06:06.620
And now I can do
things like concatenate

01:06:06.620 --> 01:06:10.010
from here to here to here.

01:06:10.010 --> 01:06:16.801
And I will get this
plus this plus this.

01:06:16.801 --> 01:06:17.300
OK.

01:06:17.300 --> 01:06:18.579
This guy moved here.

01:06:18.579 --> 01:06:20.870
So that's a copy/paste
operation with a constant number

01:06:20.870 --> 01:06:22.100
of splits and concatenates.

01:06:22.100 --> 01:06:23.810
I could also do cut and paste.

01:06:23.810 --> 01:06:26.720
With confluence, I can
do crazy cuts and pastes

01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:28.950
in all sorts of ways.

01:06:28.950 --> 01:06:29.910
So what?

01:06:29.910 --> 01:06:32.120
Well, the so what
is I can actually

01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:33.990
double the size of
my data structure

01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:36.050
in a constant number
of operations.

01:06:36.050 --> 01:06:38.270
I can take, for example,
the entire string

01:06:38.270 --> 01:06:40.031
and concatenate it to itself.

01:06:40.031 --> 01:06:41.780
That will double the
number of characters,

01:06:41.780 --> 01:06:43.740
number of elements in there.

01:06:43.740 --> 01:06:45.900
I can do that again
and again and again.

01:06:45.900 --> 01:06:51.380
So in u updates,
I can potentially

01:06:51.380 --> 01:06:53.000
get a data structure
size 2 to the u.

01:06:57.770 --> 01:06:58.610
Kind of nifty.

01:06:58.610 --> 01:07:00.350
I think this is why
confluence is cool.

01:07:00.350 --> 01:07:02.700
It's also why it's hard.

01:07:02.700 --> 01:07:03.900
So not a big surprise.

01:07:03.900 --> 01:07:08.130
But, here we go.

01:07:08.130 --> 01:07:13.490
In that case, the version DAG,
for reference, looks like this.

01:07:13.490 --> 01:07:16.180
You're taking the same
version, combining it.

01:07:16.180 --> 01:07:20.460
So here I'm assuming I have
a concatenate operation.

01:07:20.460 --> 01:07:24.240
And so the effect here,
every time I do this,

01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:25.140
I double the size.

01:07:44.210 --> 01:07:44.817
All right.

01:07:44.817 --> 01:07:46.900
What do I want to say about
confluent persistence?

01:07:46.900 --> 01:07:47.399
All right.

01:07:47.399 --> 01:07:53.200
Let me start with the
most general result, which

01:07:53.200 --> 01:08:04.340
is by Fiat and Kaplan in 2003.

01:08:04.340 --> 01:08:08.817
They define a notion called
effective depth of a version.

01:08:08.817 --> 01:08:09.900
Let me just write it down.

01:08:21.180 --> 01:08:24.870
It's kind of like
if you took this DAG

01:08:24.870 --> 01:08:30.113
and expanded it out to be a
tree of all possible paths.

01:08:30.113 --> 01:08:31.529
Instead of point
to the same node,

01:08:31.529 --> 01:08:33.330
you could just
duplicate that node

01:08:33.330 --> 01:08:35.260
and then have pointers
left and right.

01:08:35.260 --> 01:08:35.760
OK.

01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:38.218
So if I did that, of course,
this size grows exponentially.

01:08:38.218 --> 01:08:41.310
It explicitly represents the
size of my data structure.

01:08:41.310 --> 01:08:42.810
At the bottom, if
I have u things,

01:08:42.810 --> 01:08:45.960
I'm going to have 2 to the
u leaves at the bottom.

01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:49.080
But then I can easily
measure the number of paths

01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:50.500
from the root to
the same version.

01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:52.250
At the bottom, I still
label it, oh, those

01:08:52.250 --> 01:08:54.630
are all v. They're all the
same version down there.

01:08:54.630 --> 01:08:56.664
So exponential number
of paths, if I take log,

01:08:56.664 --> 01:08:58.080
I get what I call
effective depth.

01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:02.250
It's like if you somehow
could rebalance that tree,

01:09:02.250 --> 01:09:05.910
this is the best you
could hope to do.

01:09:05.910 --> 01:09:07.270
It's not really a lower bound.

01:09:07.270 --> 01:09:08.040
But it's a number.

01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:09.000
It's a thing.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:10.470
OK.

01:09:10.470 --> 01:09:17.370
Then the result they achieve
is that the overhead is

01:09:17.370 --> 01:09:19.790
log the number of
updates plus-- this

01:09:19.790 --> 01:09:22.290
is a multiplicative overhead,
so you take your running time.

01:09:22.290 --> 01:09:25.979
You multiply it by this.

01:09:25.979 --> 01:09:28.649
And this is a time
and a space overhead.

01:09:31.529 --> 01:09:34.260
So maximum effective depth
of all versions, maybe even

01:09:34.260 --> 01:09:39.100
sum of effective depths, but
we'll just say max to be safe.

01:09:39.100 --> 01:09:41.800
Sorry-- sum over
all the operations.

01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:43.129
This is per operation.

01:09:43.129 --> 01:09:44.670
You pay basically
the effective depth

01:09:44.670 --> 01:09:48.779
of that operation as a factor.

01:09:48.779 --> 01:09:51.330
Now, the annoying thing is if
you have this kind of set up

01:09:51.330 --> 01:09:54.720
where the size
grew exponentially,

01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:56.490
then number of paths
is exponential.

01:09:56.490 --> 01:09:59.220
Log of the number of
paths is linear in u.

01:09:59.220 --> 01:10:06.420
And so this factor could be
as much as u, linear slowdown.

01:10:06.420 --> 01:10:08.820
Now, Fiat and Kaplan argue
linear slowdown is not

01:10:08.820 --> 01:10:13.440
that bad, because if you weren't
even persistent, if you did

01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:18.410
this in the naive way of
just recopying the data,

01:10:18.410 --> 01:10:21.579
you were actually spending
exponential time to build

01:10:21.579 --> 01:10:22.620
the final data structure.

01:10:22.620 --> 01:10:23.619
It has exponential size.

01:10:23.619 --> 01:10:26.800
Just to represent it explicitly
requires exponential time,

01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:29.820
so losing a linear
factor to do u operations

01:10:29.820 --> 01:10:31.800
and now u squared time
instead of 2 to the u.

01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:35.190
So it's a big
improvement to do this.

01:10:35.190 --> 01:10:40.440
The downside of this approach is
that even if you have a version

01:10:40.440 --> 01:10:43.410
DAG that looks like this,
even if the size of the data

01:10:43.410 --> 01:10:46.402
structure is staying
normal, staying linear, so

01:10:46.402 --> 01:10:48.360
this potential, you could
be doubling the size.

01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:49.920
But we don't know what
this merge operation is.

01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:51.794
Maybe it just throws
away one of the versions

01:10:51.794 --> 01:10:53.220
or does something--

01:10:53.220 --> 01:10:55.230
somehow takes half
the nodes from one

01:10:55.230 --> 01:10:57.188
side, half the nodes from
the other side maybe.

01:10:57.188 --> 01:10:58.830
These operations
do preserve size.

01:10:58.830 --> 01:11:02.520
Then there's no great reason why
it should be a linear slowdown,

01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:03.671
but it is.

01:11:03.671 --> 01:11:04.170
OK?

01:11:04.170 --> 01:11:07.650
So it's all right but not great.

01:11:10.830 --> 01:11:13.560
And it's the best
general result we know.

01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:15.540
They also prove a lower bound.

01:11:21.420 --> 01:11:30.345
So lower bound is some effect
of depth, total bits of space.

01:11:37.230 --> 01:11:37.730
OK.

01:11:37.730 --> 01:11:40.020
What does this mean?

01:11:40.020 --> 01:11:42.170
So even if this
is not happening,

01:11:42.170 --> 01:11:44.150
the number of bits
of space you need

01:11:44.150 --> 01:11:45.800
in the worst case--
this does not

01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:47.810
apply to every data structure.

01:11:47.810 --> 01:11:49.790
That's one catch.

01:11:49.790 --> 01:11:52.070
They give a specific
data structure

01:11:52.070 --> 01:11:53.630
where you need this much space.

01:11:53.630 --> 01:11:57.050
So it's similar to
this kind of picture.

01:11:57.050 --> 01:11:58.940
We'll go into the details.

01:11:58.940 --> 01:12:00.860
And you need this much space.

01:12:00.860 --> 01:12:02.720
Now, this is kind of
bad, because if there's

01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:06.440
u operations, and each of these
is u, that's u squared space.

01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:09.395
So we actually need a
factor u blow up in space.

01:12:09.395 --> 01:12:11.290
It looks like.

01:12:11.290 --> 01:12:14.150
But to be more precise,
what this means is

01:12:14.150 --> 01:12:17.270
that you need omega e of
v space, and therefore

01:12:17.270 --> 01:12:27.830
time overhead per update, if--

01:12:27.830 --> 01:12:29.570
this is not written
in the paper--

01:12:29.570 --> 01:12:30.560
queries are free.

01:12:35.300 --> 01:12:40.400
Implicit here, they just want
to slow down and increase space

01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:43.310
for the updates you do,
which is pretty natural.

01:12:43.310 --> 01:12:46.870
Normally you think of queries
as not increasing space.

01:12:46.870 --> 01:12:49.600
But in order to construct
this lower bound,

01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:52.360
they actually do
this many queries.

01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:55.900
So they do e of v queries
and then one update.

01:12:55.900 --> 01:12:59.410
And they say, oh well, space
had to go up by an extra e of v.

01:12:59.410 --> 01:13:02.470
So if you only charge
updates for the space,

01:13:02.470 --> 01:13:04.120
then yes, you have
to lose potentially

01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:07.780
a linear factor, this effect
of death, potentially u.

01:13:07.780 --> 01:13:09.550
But if you also
charge the queries,

01:13:09.550 --> 01:13:13.270
it's still constant
in their example.

01:13:13.270 --> 01:13:18.100
So open question, for
confluent persistence,

01:13:18.100 --> 01:13:21.130
can you achieve
constant everything?

01:13:21.130 --> 01:13:27.160
Constant time and
space overheads,

01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:33.610
multiplicative
factor per operation,

01:13:33.610 --> 01:13:35.425
both updates and queries.

01:13:35.425 --> 01:13:37.300
So if you charge the
queries, potentially you

01:13:37.300 --> 01:13:38.980
could get constant everything.

01:13:38.980 --> 01:13:41.040
This is a relatively
new realization.

01:13:43.890 --> 01:13:47.325
And no one knows
how to do this yet.

01:13:47.325 --> 01:13:47.950
Nice challenge.

01:13:47.950 --> 01:13:50.530
I think maybe we'll work on that
in our first problem session.

01:13:50.530 --> 01:13:51.196
I would like to.

01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:54.770
Questions about that result?

01:13:54.770 --> 01:13:56.450
I'm not going to
prove the result.

01:13:56.450 --> 01:13:59.540
But it is a fancy
rebalancing of those kinds

01:13:59.540 --> 01:14:02.300
of pictures to get this log.

01:14:10.266 --> 01:14:12.390
There are other results
I'd like to tell you about.

01:14:32.630 --> 01:14:34.710
So brand new result--

01:14:34.710 --> 01:14:35.980
that was from 2003.

01:14:35.980 --> 01:14:38.300
This is from 2012--

01:14:38.300 --> 01:14:42.590
no, '11, '11, sorry.

01:14:42.590 --> 01:14:47.480
It's SOTO, which is in January,
so it's a little confusing.

01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:49.250
Is it '11?

01:14:49.250 --> 01:14:50.267
Maybe '12.

01:14:50.267 --> 01:14:51.350
Actually now I'm not sure.

01:14:51.350 --> 01:14:54.750
It's February already, right?

01:14:54.750 --> 01:14:56.870
A January, either this
year or last year.

01:15:00.310 --> 01:15:02.840
It's not as general
a transformation.

01:15:02.840 --> 01:15:05.330
It's only going to hold in
what's called a disjoint case.

01:15:05.330 --> 01:15:07.820
But it gets a very good bound--

01:15:07.820 --> 01:15:09.850
not quite constant,
but logarithmic.

01:15:09.850 --> 01:15:12.420
OK, logarithmic
would also be nice.

01:15:12.420 --> 01:15:17.075
Or log, log n, whatever n is.

01:15:17.075 --> 01:15:22.450
Pick your favorite n,
number of operations, say.

01:15:22.450 --> 01:15:22.950
OK.

01:15:25.700 --> 01:15:39.830
If you assume that confluent
operations are performed only

01:15:39.830 --> 01:15:46.070
on two versions with
no shared nodes--

01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:53.870
OK, this would be a way to
forbid this kind of behavior

01:15:53.870 --> 01:15:56.660
where I concatenate the
data structure with itself.

01:15:56.660 --> 01:15:58.520
All the nodes are common.

01:15:58.520 --> 01:16:01.840
If I guarantee that maybe I, you
know, slice this up, slice it,

01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:03.590
dice it, wherever, and
then re-emerge them

01:16:03.590 --> 01:16:06.230
in some other order, but
I never use two copies

01:16:06.230 --> 01:16:10.130
of the same piece, that
would be a valid confluent

01:16:10.130 --> 01:16:12.260
operation over here.

01:16:12.260 --> 01:16:13.880
This is quite a
strong restriction

01:16:13.880 --> 01:16:16.580
that you're not allowed.

01:16:16.580 --> 01:16:19.030
If you try to, who
knows what happens.

01:16:19.030 --> 01:16:19.980
Behavior's undefined.

01:16:19.980 --> 01:16:21.830
So won't tell you,
oh, those two versions

01:16:21.830 --> 01:16:22.871
have this node in common.

01:16:22.871 --> 01:16:24.600
You've got to make
a second copy of it.

01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:27.099
So somehow you have to guarantee
that control and operations

01:16:27.099 --> 01:16:29.270
never overlap.

01:16:29.270 --> 01:16:30.757
But they can be reordered.

01:16:33.740 --> 01:16:39.500
Then you can get
order log n overhead.

01:16:39.500 --> 01:16:40.850
n is the number of operations.

01:16:45.390 --> 01:16:46.970
I have a sketch
of a proof of this

01:16:46.970 --> 01:16:48.870
but not very much
time to talk about it.

01:16:48.870 --> 01:16:49.370
All right.

01:16:49.370 --> 01:16:51.570
Let me give you a quick picture.

01:16:51.570 --> 01:16:55.790
In general, the
versions form a DAG.

01:16:55.790 --> 01:17:00.950
But if you make this assumption,
and you look at a single node,

01:17:00.950 --> 01:17:03.620
and look at all the versions
where that node appears,

01:17:03.620 --> 01:17:05.210
that is a tree.

01:17:05.210 --> 01:17:07.370
Because you're not allowed
to remerge versions

01:17:07.370 --> 01:17:08.720
that have the same node.

01:17:08.720 --> 01:17:11.480
So while the big
picture is a DAG,

01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:15.090
the small picture of a
single guy is some tree.

01:17:17.504 --> 01:17:18.920
I'm drawing all
these wiggly lines

01:17:18.920 --> 01:17:20.000
because there are all
these versions where

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:21.560
the node isn't changing.

01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:23.300
This is the entire version DAG.

01:17:23.300 --> 01:17:26.540
And then some of these nodes--

01:17:26.540 --> 01:17:29.000
some of these versions,
I should say--

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.925
that node that we're
thinking about changes.

01:17:31.925 --> 01:17:33.860
OK, whenever it
branches, it's probably

01:17:33.860 --> 01:17:36.410
because the actual
node changed, maybe.

01:17:36.410 --> 01:17:37.470
I don't know.

01:17:37.470 --> 01:17:40.170
Anyway there are some dots
here where the version changed,

01:17:40.170 --> 01:17:41.960
some of the leaves,
maybe, that changed.

01:17:41.960 --> 01:17:44.420
Maybe some of them haven't yet.

01:17:44.420 --> 01:17:48.350
In fact, let's see.

01:17:48.350 --> 01:17:51.170
Here where it's change, it could
be that we destroyed the node.

01:17:51.170 --> 01:17:54.560
Maybe it's gone from the
actual data structure.

01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:56.542
But there still may
be versions down here.

01:17:56.542 --> 01:17:57.500
It's not really a tree.

01:17:57.500 --> 01:17:59.480
It's a whole DAG of
stuff down there.

01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:01.400
So that's kind of ugly.

01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:03.080
Where never the
node still exists,

01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:05.300
I guess that is an
actual leaf of the DAG.

01:18:05.300 --> 01:18:06.650
So those are OK.

01:18:06.650 --> 01:18:08.870
But as soon as I maybe
delete that node,

01:18:08.870 --> 01:18:11.610
then there can be a
whole subtree down there.

01:18:11.610 --> 01:18:12.110
OK.

01:18:12.110 --> 01:18:15.120
So now if you look at
an arbitrary version,

01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:17.580
so what we're thinking about
is how to implement reading,

01:18:17.580 --> 01:18:18.080
let's say.

01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:21.110
Reading and writing are
more or less the same.

01:18:21.110 --> 01:18:22.280
I give you a version.

01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:23.720
I give you a node, and
I give you a field.

01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:26.180
I want to know, what is the
value of that field, that node,

01:18:26.180 --> 01:18:27.810
that version?

01:18:27.810 --> 01:18:30.014
So now where could
a version fall?

01:18:30.014 --> 01:18:31.430
Well it has to be
in this subtree.

01:18:31.430 --> 01:18:33.990
Because the node has to exist.

01:18:36.950 --> 01:18:38.390
And then it's maybe a pointer.

01:18:38.390 --> 01:18:42.830
A pointer could be to
another node, which

01:18:42.830 --> 01:18:44.540
also has this kind of picture.

01:18:44.540 --> 01:18:46.460
They could be overlapping trees.

01:18:46.460 --> 01:18:48.140
In general, there
are three cases.

01:18:48.140 --> 01:18:51.110
Either you're lucky, and the
version you're talking about

01:18:51.110 --> 01:18:53.960
is a version where
the node was changed.

01:18:53.960 --> 01:18:58.470
In that case, the data is
just stored right there.

01:18:58.470 --> 01:18:59.125
That's easy.

01:18:59.125 --> 01:19:01.250
So you could just say, oh,
how did the node change?

01:19:01.250 --> 01:19:02.630
Oh, that's what the field is.

01:19:02.630 --> 01:19:05.190
OK, follow the pointer.

01:19:05.190 --> 01:19:08.210
A slightly harder
case it's a version

01:19:08.210 --> 01:19:09.590
in between two such changes.

01:19:09.590 --> 01:19:11.660
And maybe these are not updates.

01:19:11.660 --> 01:19:17.330
So I sort of want to know, what
was the previous version where

01:19:17.330 --> 01:19:21.650
this node changed
in constant time?

01:19:21.650 --> 01:19:22.620
It can be done.

01:19:22.620 --> 01:19:25.160
Not constant time,
actually, logarithmic time,

01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:28.120
using a data structure
called link-cut trees,

01:19:28.120 --> 01:19:31.010
another fun black
box for now, which

01:19:31.010 --> 01:19:36.171
we will cover in lecture
19, far in the future.

01:19:36.171 --> 01:19:36.670
OK.

01:19:39.884 --> 01:19:40.800
Well, that's one case.

01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:43.190
There's also the version
where maybe a version

01:19:43.190 --> 01:19:45.110
is down here in a subtree.

01:19:45.110 --> 01:19:48.340
I guess then the
node didn't exist.

01:19:48.340 --> 01:19:50.490
Well, all these
things can happen.

01:19:50.490 --> 01:19:51.800
And that's even harder.

01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:53.360
It's messy.

01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:59.720
They use another trick, which
is called fractional cascading,

01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:02.240
which I'm not even going to
try to describe what it means.

01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:04.190
But it's got a very cool name.

01:20:04.190 --> 01:20:06.080
Because we'll be
covering it in lecture 3.

01:20:06.080 --> 01:20:07.284
So stay tuned for that.

01:20:07.284 --> 01:20:09.450
I'm not going to say how
it applies to this setting,

01:20:09.450 --> 01:20:13.330
but it's a necessary
step in here.

01:20:13.330 --> 01:20:15.364
In the remaining
zero minutes, let

01:20:15.364 --> 01:20:17.780
me tell you a little bit about
functional data structures.

01:20:17.780 --> 01:20:20.005
[LAUGHTER]

01:20:20.900 --> 01:20:21.910
Beauty of time travel.

01:20:24.830 --> 01:20:31.130
Functional-- I just
want to give you

01:20:31.130 --> 01:20:33.590
some examples of things that
can be done functionally.

01:20:33.590 --> 01:20:35.798
There's a whole book about
functional data structures

01:20:35.798 --> 01:20:36.700
by Okasaki.

01:20:36.700 --> 01:20:38.180
It's pretty cool.

01:20:38.180 --> 01:20:42.320
A simple example
is balanced BSTs.

01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:44.600
So if you just want to get
log n time for everything,

01:20:44.600 --> 01:20:45.890
you can do that functionally.

01:20:45.890 --> 01:20:46.890
It's actually really easy.

01:20:46.890 --> 01:20:48.920
You pick your favorite balance
BST, like red black trees.

01:20:48.920 --> 01:20:51.260
You implement it top down so you
never follow parent pointers.

01:20:51.260 --> 01:20:52.710
So you don't need
parent pointers.

01:20:52.710 --> 01:20:57.710
So then as you make changes
down the tree, you just copy.

01:20:57.710 --> 01:20:58.995
It's called path copying.

01:20:58.995 --> 01:21:00.620
Whenever you're about
to make a change,

01:21:00.620 --> 01:21:02.070
make a copy of that node.

01:21:02.070 --> 01:21:05.450
So you end up copying all
the change nodes and all

01:21:05.450 --> 01:21:06.200
their ancestors.

01:21:06.200 --> 01:21:09.650
There's only log n of them,
so it takes log n time.

01:21:09.650 --> 01:21:10.500
Clear?

01:21:10.500 --> 01:21:11.500
Easy.

01:21:11.500 --> 01:21:12.620
It's a nice technique.

01:21:12.620 --> 01:21:14.600
Sometimes path copying
is very useful.

01:21:14.600 --> 01:21:16.170
Like link-cut
trees, for example,

01:21:16.170 --> 01:21:17.450
can be made functional.

01:21:17.450 --> 01:21:19.905
We don't know what they are,
but they're basically a BST.

01:21:19.905 --> 01:21:21.280
And you can make
them functional.

01:21:21.280 --> 01:21:23.291
We use that in a paper.

01:21:23.291 --> 01:21:23.790
All right.

01:21:23.790 --> 01:21:25.970
Deques.

01:21:25.970 --> 01:21:27.800
These are doubly ended queues.

01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:29.990
So it's like a stack and
a queue and everything.

01:21:29.990 --> 01:21:32.900
You can insert and delete from
the beginning and the end.

01:21:32.900 --> 01:21:34.730
People start to know
what these are now,

01:21:34.730 --> 01:21:35.980
because Python calls him that.

01:21:35.980 --> 01:21:41.090
But you can also
do concatenation

01:21:41.090 --> 01:21:43.310
with deques in constant
time per operation.

01:21:43.310 --> 01:21:44.150
This is cool.

01:21:44.150 --> 01:21:46.220
Deques are not very
hard to make functional.

01:21:46.220 --> 01:21:48.500
But you can do deques and
you can concatenate them

01:21:48.500 --> 01:21:51.980
like we were doing in the figure
that's right behind this board.

01:21:51.980 --> 01:21:53.690
Constant time split
is a little harder.

01:21:53.690 --> 01:21:56.870
That's actually one
of my open problems.

01:21:56.870 --> 01:22:01.580
Can you do lists with split and
concatenate in constant time--

01:22:01.580 --> 01:22:05.840
functionally or confluently,
persistently, or whatever?

01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:08.580
Another example-- oh, you
can do a mix of the two.

01:22:08.580 --> 01:22:12.390
You can get log n search in
constant time deque operations,

01:22:12.390 --> 01:22:14.870
is you can do tries.

01:22:14.870 --> 01:22:17.900
So a try is a tree
with a fixed topology.

01:22:17.900 --> 01:22:20.010
Think of it as a directory tree.

01:22:20.010 --> 01:22:21.530
So maybe you're
using Subversion.

01:22:21.530 --> 01:22:23.120
Subversion has time
travel operations.

01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:26.240
You can copy an entire
subtree from one version

01:22:26.240 --> 01:22:30.620
and stick it into a new
version, another version.

01:22:30.620 --> 01:22:32.685
So you get a version DAG.

01:22:32.685 --> 01:22:34.850
It's a confluently
persistent data structure--

01:22:34.850 --> 01:22:37.610
not implemented optimally,
because we don't necessarily

01:22:37.610 --> 01:22:38.240
know how.

01:22:38.240 --> 01:22:40.200
But there is one paper.

01:22:40.200 --> 01:22:43.910
This actually came from the open
problem section of this class

01:22:43.910 --> 01:22:45.590
four years ago, I think.

01:22:45.590 --> 01:22:49.520
It's with Eric Price
and Stefan Langerman.

01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:50.929
You can get very good results.

01:22:50.929 --> 01:22:52.970
I won't write them down
because it takes a while.

01:22:52.970 --> 01:22:56.450
Basically log the degree
of the nodes factor

01:22:56.450 --> 01:22:59.690
and get functional, and
you can be even fancier

01:22:59.690 --> 01:23:02.480
and get slightly better
bounds like log log the degree

01:23:02.480 --> 01:23:05.370
and get confluently persistent
with various tricks,

01:23:05.370 --> 01:23:07.530
including using all of
these data structures.

01:23:07.530 --> 01:23:09.800
So if you want to implement
subversion optimally,

01:23:09.800 --> 01:23:14.390
that is known how to be done but
hasn't actually been done yet.

01:23:14.390 --> 01:23:18.110
Because there are those
pesky constant factors.

01:23:18.110 --> 01:23:19.670
I think that's all.

01:23:19.670 --> 01:23:23.030
What is known about functional
is there's a log n separation.

01:23:23.030 --> 01:23:26.890
You can be log n
away from the best.

01:23:26.890 --> 01:23:30.230
That's the worst
separation known,

01:23:30.230 --> 01:23:33.012
between functional and just
a regular old data structure.

01:23:33.012 --> 01:23:34.220
It'd be nice to improve that.

01:23:34.220 --> 01:23:35.345
Lots of open problems here.

01:23:35.345 --> 01:23:38.140
Maybe we'll work
on them next time.
