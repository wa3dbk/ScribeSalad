00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:21.970
ERIK DEMAINE: All right.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.904
Today is all about the
predecessor problem, which

00:00:24.904 --> 00:00:27.070
is a problem we've certainly
talked about implicitly

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:28.540
with, say, binary search trees.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.940
You want to be able to
insert and delete into a set,

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:34.570
and compute the predecessor
and successor of any given key.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.115
So maybe define that formally.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.070
And this is not
really our first,

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.370
but it is an example of
an integer data structure.

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.980
And for whatever
reason, I don't brand

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.900
hashing as an integer
data structure,

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.384
just because it's its own beast.

00:01:01.384 --> 00:01:03.550
But in particular, today,
I need to be a little more

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.030
formal about the models of
computation we're allowing--

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.600
or I want to be.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.880
In particular, because, in the
predecessor problem, which is,

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:19.410
insert, delete,
predecessor, successor,

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.540
there are actually lower bounds
that say you cannot do better

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:23.950
than such and such.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.170
With hashing, there aren't
really any lower bounds,

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.086
because you can do
everything in constant time

00:01:28.086 --> 00:01:29.017
with high probability.

00:01:29.017 --> 00:01:30.850
So I mean, there are
maybe some lower bounds

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:31.990
on deterministic hashing.

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.080
That's harder.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.850
But if you allow randomization,
there's no real lower bounds,

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.710
whereas predecessor, there is.

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:46.566
And in general,
predecessor problem--

00:01:46.566 --> 00:01:48.670
the key thing I
want to highlight

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.500
is that we're maintaining
here a set of--

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:04.270
the set is called s
of n elements, which

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.890
live in some universe, U--

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.014
just like last time.

00:02:08.014 --> 00:02:10.180
When you insert, you can
insert an arbitrary element

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.900
of the universe.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:14.895
That probably shouldn't be an
s, or it will get thrown away.

00:02:14.895 --> 00:02:17.020
But the key thing is that
predecessor and successor

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.600
operate not just on
the [INAUDIBLE] in s,

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.000
but you can give it any key.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.390
It doesn't have to be in there.

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.475
And it will find the
previous key that is in s,

00:02:24.475 --> 00:02:26.350
or the next key that is in s.

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.280
So predecessor is
the largest key

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.030
that is less than or equal
to x that's in your set.

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:43.406
And successor is the
smallest that is larger--

00:02:43.406 --> 00:02:44.530
of course, if there is one.

00:02:48.675 --> 00:02:50.800
So those are the kinds of
operations we want to do.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.040
Now, we know how to do all of
this n log n time, no problem,

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.850
with binary search trees,
in the comparison model.

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.330
But I want to introduce two
more, say, realistic models

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.620
of computers, that ignore
the memory hierarchy,

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.620
but think about
regular RAM machines--

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.212
random access machines--
and what they can really do.

00:03:13.212 --> 00:03:15.670
And it's a model we're going
to be working on for the next,

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.780
I think, five lectures.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.630
So, important to
set the stage right.

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.267
So these are models for
integer data structures.

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.960
In general, we have
a unifying concept,

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:40.045
which is a word of
information, a word of data,

00:03:40.045 --> 00:03:41.690
a word of memory.

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.730
It's used all over the
place-- a word of input.

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.640
A word is the machine
theoretic sense,

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.790
not like the linguistic sense.

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.300
It's going to be
a w-bit integer.

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.790
And so this defines the
universe, which is--

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.910
I'm going to assume they're
all unsigned integers.

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.120
So this is 2 to the w minus one.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.000
Those are all the
unsigned integers

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.760
you can represent with w-bits.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.860
We'll also call this number,
2 to the w, little u.

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:16.060
That is the size of the
universe, which is capital U.

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.399
So this matches
notation from last time.

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:23.350
But I'm really highlighting how
many bits we have, which is w.

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.980
Now, here's where
things get interesting.

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.930
I'm going to get to
a model called a word

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.469
RAM, which is what you
might expect, more or less.

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:34.510
But before I get there I
want to define something

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.770
called transdichotomous RAM--

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.280
tough word to spell.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.360
It just means bridging
a dichotomy-- bridging

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.510
two worlds, if you will.

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.170
RAM is a random access machine.

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:54.294
I've certainly mentioned
the word RAM before.

00:04:54.294 --> 00:04:56.710
But now we're going to get a
little more precise about it.

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.360
So in general, in the
RAM, memory is an array.

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.530
And you can do random
access into the array.

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.580
But now, we're going to say,
the cells of the memory--

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:07.990
each slot in that array--

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:09.040
is a word.

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.540
Everything is
going to be a word.

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:14.887
Every input-- all these
x's are going to be words.

00:05:14.887 --> 00:05:15.970
Everything will be a word.

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.520
And in particular, the things
in your memory are words.

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:22.300
Let's say you have s of them.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.750
That's your space bound.

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.430
In general, in
transdichotomous RAM,

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:34.180
you can do any operation
that reads and writes

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:40.600
a constant number
of words in memory.

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:45.860
And in particular, you can do
random access to that memory.

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:52.225
But in particular, we use
words to serve as pointers.

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:59.665
Here's my memory of words.

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:05.460
Each of them is w bits--

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:12.040
so s of them, from, I
guess, 0 to s minus one.

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:17.170
And if you have, like,
the number 3 here,

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:21.610
that can be used as a pointer
to the third slot of memory.

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:24.910
One, two, three.

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:27.187
You can use numbers as
indexes into memory.

00:06:27.187 --> 00:06:29.270
So that's what I mean by,
words serve as pointers.

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:32.110
So particularly, you can
implement a pointer machine,

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:33.850
which-- no surprise--

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:39.760
but for this to work, we
need a lower bound on w.

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:44.440
This implies w has to be at
least log of the space bound.

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:47.560
Otherwise, you just can't
index your whole memory.

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.940
And if you've got s minus 1
things, this 2 to the w minus 1

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:53.880
better be at least s minus 1.

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.980
So we get this lower bound.

00:06:55.980 --> 00:07:03.621
So in particular, presumably, s
is at least your problem size,

00:07:03.621 --> 00:07:04.120
n.

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:05.880
If you're trying to
maintain n items,

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:08.670
you've got to store them.

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:12.420
So w is at least log n.

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:17.760
Now, this relation is
essentially a statement

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:18.930
bridging two worlds.

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:20.560
Namely, you have,
on the one hand,

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:24.045
your model of computation, which
has a particular word size.

00:07:24.045 --> 00:07:28.590
And in reality, we think of that
as being 32 or 64 or maybe 128.

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:31.230
Some fancy operations
on Intel machines,

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:34.650
you can do 128-bit or so.

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:36.210
And then there's
your problem size,

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:37.830
which we think of as an input.

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:39.810
Now, this is relating the two.

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:40.929
It's a little weird.

00:07:40.929 --> 00:07:43.470
I guess you could say it's just
a limitation for a given CPU.

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:46.100
There's only certain
problems you can solve.

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:49.687
But theoretically, it
makes a lot of sense

00:07:49.687 --> 00:07:50.520
to relate these two.

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:52.770
Because if you're
in a RAM, and you've

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:54.889
got to be able to
index your data,

00:07:54.889 --> 00:07:56.430
you need at least
that many bits just

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:58.860
to be able to talk
about all those things.

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:01.680
And so the claim is,
basically, machines

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.980
will grow to
accommodate memory size.

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:06.700
As memory size grows,
you'll need more bits.

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:11.894
Now, in reality, there's
only about 2 to 256--

00:08:11.894 --> 00:08:13.320
what do you call
them-- particles

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:15.250
in the known universe.

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:18.520
So word size probably
won't get that much bigger.

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:20.440
Beyond 256 should be OK.

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:23.610
But theoretically,
this is a nice way

00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:26.220
to formalize this claim
that word sizes don't

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:29.370
need to get too big unless
memories get gigantic.

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:32.400
So it may seem weird at
first, but it's very natural.

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:35.549
And all real world machines
have big enough words

00:08:35.549 --> 00:08:36.750
to accommodate that.

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:38.833
Word size could be bigger,
and that will give you,

00:08:38.833 --> 00:08:40.320
essentially, more parallelism.

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:42.789
But it should be
at least that big.

00:08:42.789 --> 00:08:43.289
All right.

00:08:43.289 --> 00:08:46.030
Enough proselytizing.

00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:52.350
That's the transdichotomous RAM.

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:54.060
The end.

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:56.220
And the word RAM is
a specific version

00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:04.230
of the transdichotomous
RAM, where

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:07.440
you restrict the operations
to c-like operations.

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:13.362
These are sort of the standard--

00:09:13.362 --> 00:09:14.820
they're instructions
on, basically,

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:18.850
all computers, except a few
risk architectures don't have

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:21.650
multiplication and division.

00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:26.191
But everything else
is on everything.

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:35.200
So these are the operators,
unless I missed one, in c.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:37.530
They're all in Python,
and pick your--

00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:38.565
most languages.

00:09:38.565 --> 00:09:42.696
You've got integer
arithmetic, including mod.

00:09:42.696 --> 00:09:46.230
You've got bitwise and,
bitwise or, bitwise x

00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:50.730
or, bitwise negation, and
shift left, and shift right.

00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:53.400
These we all view as
taking constant time.

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:59.700
They take one or two integer
inputs-- words as inputs.

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:01.120
They can compute an answer.

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:03.150
They write out another word.

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:05.771
Of course, there's also random
access-- array dereference,

00:10:05.771 --> 00:10:06.270
I guess.

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:12.110
So that's the word RAM.

00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:13.260
You restrict to
these operations.

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:14.460
Whereas transdichotomous
RAM, you

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:16.501
can do weird things, as
long as they only involve

00:10:16.501 --> 00:10:18.030
a constant number of words.

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:19.890
Word RAM-- it's
the regular thing.

00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:22.800
So this is basically
the standard model

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:25.350
that all integer data
structures use, pretty much.

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:28.200
If they don't use this
model, they have to say so.

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:31.590
Otherwise this model has become
accepted as the normal one.

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:33.930
It took several years
before people realized

00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:36.360
that's a good model--
good enough to capture

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:39.300
pretty much everything we want.

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:41.280
The cool thing
about word RAM is,

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:43.980
it lets you do things
on w-bits in parallel.

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:47.920
You can take the and of
w-bits, pairwise, all at once.

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:49.684
So you get some speed up.

00:10:49.684 --> 00:10:51.600
But it's a natural
generalization of something

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:52.683
like the comparison model.

00:10:52.683 --> 00:10:55.215
Comparison model-- I guess
I didn't write those.

00:10:55.215 --> 00:10:59.040
It's more operations-- less
than, greater than, and so on.

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:01.290
You can compare two
numbers in constant time,

00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:03.900
get a Boolean output
via, say, subtraction,

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:05.050
and computing the sine.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.230
And you think of comparisons
as taking constant time,

00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:14.850
so why not all of these things?

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:15.930
Cool.

00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:21.710
One more model-- this
is kind of a weird one.

00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:25.920
It's called cell
probe model, which

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:31.440
is, we just count
the number of memory

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:42.206
reads and writes that we
need to do to solve a data

00:11:42.206 --> 00:11:43.080
structure or a query.

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:44.905
Like, you you're
looking at predecessor,

00:11:44.905 --> 00:11:47.280
and you just want to know,
how much of the data structure

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:50.271
do I have to read in order to be
able to answer the predecessor

00:11:50.271 --> 00:11:50.770
problem?

00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:52.311
How much do I have
to write out to do

00:11:52.311 --> 00:11:55.140
an insertion, or whatever?

00:11:55.140 --> 00:12:00.480
And so in this model,
computation is free.

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:04.889
And this is kind of like
the external memory model,

00:12:04.889 --> 00:12:06.180
and the cache oblivious models.

00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:07.830
There, we were
measuring how many block

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:08.955
reads and writes there are.

00:12:08.955 --> 00:12:11.160
Here, our blocks are
actually our words.

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:14.397
So there is a bit of a relation,
except there's no real--

00:12:14.397 --> 00:12:16.230
you can either think
of there being no cache

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:17.130
here, because
you're just reading

00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:19.463
in a constant number of words,
doing something, spitting

00:12:19.463 --> 00:12:20.029
stuff out.

00:12:20.029 --> 00:12:21.570
Or in the cell probe
model, you could

00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:24.630
imagine there being an infinite
cache for this operation,

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:26.365
but no cache from
operation to operation.

00:12:26.365 --> 00:12:28.740
It's just, how much do I have
to [INAUDIBLE] information,

00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:31.190
theoretically, to solve a
particular predecessor problem?

00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:33.060
We'll deal with this
a lot in a couple

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:35.230
of lectures-- not quite yet.

00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:38.200
This model is just
used for lower bounds.

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:40.140
It's not a realistic
model, because you

00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:43.794
have to pay for computation
in the real world.

00:12:43.794 --> 00:12:45.210
But if you can
prove that you need

00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:47.520
to read at least a certain
number of words, then,

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:50.920
of course, you have to do at
least that many operations.

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:52.590
So it's nice for lower bounds.

00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:58.020
In general, we have this
sort of hierarchy of models,

00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:03.390
where this is the most
powerful, strongest,

00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:13.920
and below cell probe, we
have transdichotomous RAM,

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:20.100
then word RAM, then--
just to fit it in context,

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:21.330
what we've been doing--

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:25.620
below that is pointer
machine, and below that

00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:26.820
would be binary search tree.

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:28.445
I've mentioned before,
pointer machines

00:13:28.445 --> 00:13:30.240
are more powerful than
binary search tree.

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:32.281
And of course, we can
implement a pointer machine

00:13:32.281 --> 00:13:32.910
on a word RAM.

00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:35.112
So we have these relations.

00:13:35.112 --> 00:13:36.570
There are, of
course, other models.

00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:39.450
But this is a quick picture
of models we've seen so far.

00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:50.330
So now, we have this
notion of a word.

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:54.475
In the predecessor problem,
these elements are words.

00:13:57.090 --> 00:14:00.311
They're w-bit integers,
universe-defined.

00:14:00.311 --> 00:14:02.560
And we want to be able to
insert, delete, predecessor,

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:04.756
and successor over words.

00:14:04.756 --> 00:14:07.558
So that's our challenge.

00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:14.590
In the binary search
tree model, we

00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:16.690
know the answer to this
problem is theta log n.

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:19.690
In general, any
comparison-based data structure,

00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:22.310
you need theta log
n, in the worst case.

00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:24.710
It's an easy lower bound.

00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:28.240
But we're going to do better on
these other models in the word

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:30.040
RAM.

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:31.435
So here are some results.

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:40.840
First data structure is
called Van Emde Boas.

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:42.950
You might guess it
is by van Emde Boas--

00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:45.160
Peter.

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:46.900
It actually has a
couple other authors

00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:48.500
in some versions of
the papers, which

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:49.570
makes a little bit confusing.

00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:51.361
But for whatever reason,
the data structure

00:14:51.361 --> 00:14:54.340
is just named Van Emde Boas.

00:14:54.340 --> 00:15:03.770
And it achieves log
w per operation.

00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:05.350
I think I'll rewrite this.

00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:09.490
This is log log u per operation.

00:15:09.490 --> 00:15:12.250
But it requires u space.

00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:16.330
So think of u space as
being, like, for every item

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:19.360
in the universe I store,
yes or no, is it in the set?

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:24.700
So that's a lot of space, unless
n and u are not too different.

00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:27.310
But we can do better.

00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:29.020
But the cool thing
is the running time.

00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:30.970
This is really fast--

00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:33.040
log log u.

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:35.110
If you think about,
for example--

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:40.660
I don't know-- the universe
being polynomial in n,

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:43.300
or even if the universe
is something like--

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:45.460
polynomial in n is
the same as this--

00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:46.960
2 to the c log n.

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:49.650
You can go crazy and
say log to the c power--

00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:52.100
so, like, 2 to the log
to the fifth power.

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:55.540
All those things,
you take log twice.

00:15:55.540 --> 00:16:02.590
Then log log u becomes
theta log log n.

00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:11.545
So as long as your word
size is not insanely large,

00:16:11.545 --> 00:16:13.640
you're getting log
log n performance.

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:23.700
So in general, when, let's
say, w is is polylog n,

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:26.150
then we're getting this
kind of performance.

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:28.540
And I think on most computers,
w is polylogarithmic.

00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:30.490
We said it has to
be at least log.

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:32.670
It's also, generally, not
so much bigger than log.

00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:35.590
So log squared is probably
fine most of the time,

00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:39.680
unless you have a
really small problem.

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:40.680
OK, so cool.

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:41.770
But the space is giant.

00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:43.480
So how do we do
better than that?

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:46.700
Well, there's a
couple of answers.

00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:54.640
One is that you can achieve
log w with high probability,

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:58.660
and order n space.

00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:01.930
With a slight tweak, basically,
you combine Van Emde Boas

00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:05.876
plus hashing, and you get that.

00:17:05.876 --> 00:17:08.800
I don't actually know what the
reference is for this result.

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:14.349
It's been an exercise in
various courses, and so on.

00:17:14.349 --> 00:17:16.403
I can talk more
about that later.

00:17:16.403 --> 00:17:18.819
Then alternatively, there's
another data structure, which,

00:17:18.819 --> 00:17:20.740
in many ways, is simpler.

00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:22.240
It really embraces hashing.

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:23.980
It's called y-fast trees.

00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:26.904
It achieves the same
bounds-- so log w

00:17:26.904 --> 00:17:29.710
with high probability
and linear space.

00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:33.430
It's basically just a hash
table with some cleverness.

00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:34.240
So we'll get there.

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:35.781
Even though it's
simpler, we're going

00:17:35.781 --> 00:17:38.020
to start with this structure.

00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:40.210
Historically, this is
the way it happened--

00:17:40.210 --> 00:17:43.735
Van Emde Boas, then y-fast
trees, which are by Willard.

00:17:43.735 --> 00:17:45.670
And it'll be kind
of a nice finale.

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:53.480
There's another data structure
I want to talk about,

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:58.780
which is designed for the
case when w is very large--

00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:01.060
much bigger than polylog n.

00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:04.360
In that case, there's
something called fusion trees.

00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:09.301
And you can achieve
log base w of n--

00:18:09.301 --> 00:18:13.840
and, I guess, with high
probability and linear space.

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:18.190
The original fusion
trees are static.

00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:21.880
And you could just do log base
w of n deterministic queries.

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:24.430
But there's a later
version that dynamic,

00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:30.160
achieves this using hashing
for updates, insertions,

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:31.900
and deletions.

00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:32.560
Cool.

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:34.990
So this is an
almost upside-down--

00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:36.490
it's obviously
always an improvement

00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:41.890
over just log base 2 of n.

00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:44.430
But it's sometimes better and
sometimes worse than log w.

00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:48.490
In fact, it kind of makes
sense to take the min of them.

00:18:48.490 --> 00:18:50.780
When w is small, you
want to use log w.

00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:53.950
When w is big, you want
to use log base w of n.

00:18:53.950 --> 00:19:04.890
They're going to balance out
when w is 2 to the root log n--

00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:07.100
something like that.

00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:09.560
The easy thing is,
when these balance out

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:11.150
is when they're equal.

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:16.850
And that will be when this
is log n divided by log w.

00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:20.380
So when log w equals
log n divided by log w--

00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:22.250
let do that over here.

00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:27.870
log w is log n over log w.

00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:32.240
Then this is like saying
log squared w equals log n,

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:36.641
or log w is root log n.

00:19:36.641 --> 00:19:39.260
So I was right. w is
2 to the root log in,

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:40.352
which is a weird quantity.

00:19:40.352 --> 00:19:42.310
But the easy thing to
think about is this one--

00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:44.000
log w is root log n.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.610
And in that case, the running
time you get is root log n.

00:19:51.050 --> 00:19:52.880
So it's always, at most, this.

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:57.340
And the worst case is when
these things are balanced,

00:19:57.340 --> 00:20:00.290
or these two are the same, and
they both achieve root log n.

00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:02.780
But if w is smaller or
larger than this threshold,

00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:05.030
these structures will be
even better than root log n.

00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:06.446
But in particular,
it's a nice way

00:20:06.446 --> 00:20:09.380
to think about, oh, we're
doing sort of a square factor

00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:12.930
better than binary search trees.

00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:16.880
And we can do this high
probability in linear space.

00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:20.770
So that's cool.

00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:30.870
Turns out it's also
pretty much optimal.

00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:38.540
And that's not at all
obvious, and wasn't

00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:39.680
known for many years.

00:20:46.650 --> 00:20:50.880
So there's a cell
probe lower bound.

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:57.580
So these are all in
the word RAM model--

00:20:57.580 --> 00:20:58.670
all these results.

00:20:58.670 --> 00:21:01.236
The first one actually kind of
works in the pointer machine.

00:21:01.236 --> 00:21:02.360
I'll talk about that later.

00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:15.140
This lower bound's a
little bit messy to state.

00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:18.100
The bound is slightly
more complicated

00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:19.700
than what we've seen.

00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:22.160
But I'm going to restrict to
a special situation, which is,

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:24.660
if you have n polylog n space.

00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:27.470
So this is a lower bound
on static predecessor.

00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:30.200
All you need to do is solve
predecessor and successor,

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:31.790
or even just predecessor.

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:33.770
There's no inserts and deletes.

00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:37.250
In that case, if you use lots of
space, like u space, of course,

00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:39.110
you can do constant
time for everything.

00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:41.450
You just store all the answers.

00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:45.632
But if you want space that's
not much bigger than n--

00:21:45.632 --> 00:21:47.840
in particular, if you wanted
to be able to do updates

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:49.820
in polylog, this
is the most space

00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:51.830
you could ever hope to achieve.

00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:56.450
So assuming that, which
is pretty reasonable,

00:21:56.450 --> 00:22:00.050
there's a bound of the
min of two things--

00:22:00.050 --> 00:22:02.750
log base w of n,
which is fusion trees,

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:05.930
and, roughly, log w,
which is Van Emde Boas.

00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:07.820
But it's slightly
smaller than that.

00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:17.600
Yeah, pretty weird.

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:19.620
Let me tell you
the consequences--

00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:21.050
a little easier to think about.

00:22:21.050 --> 00:22:26.270
Van Emde Boas is going to be
optimal for the kind of cases

00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:30.360
we care about, which
is when w is polylog n.

00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:38.780
And fusion trees are
optimal when w is big.

00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:55.450
Square root log n log log n.

00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:59.870
OK-- a little messy.

00:22:59.870 --> 00:23:03.890
So there's this divided by
log of log w over log n.

00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:08.507
If w is polylog n, then this
is just order log log n.

00:23:08.507 --> 00:23:09.340
And so this cancels.

00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:10.612
This becomes constant.

00:23:10.612 --> 00:23:13.070
So in these situations, which
are the ones I mentioned over

00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:15.440
here, w is polylog
n, which is when

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:16.760
we get log log n performance.

00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:18.770
And that's kind of the
case we care about.

00:23:18.770 --> 00:23:21.320
Van Emde Boas is the
best thing to do.

00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:24.140
Turns out, this is
actually the right answer.

00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:26.670
You can do slightly better.

00:23:26.670 --> 00:23:27.830
It's almost an exercise.

00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:30.710
You can tweak Van Emde Boas and
get this slight improvement.

00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:33.600
But most word sizes, it
really doesn't matter.

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:36.420
You're not saving much.

00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:37.400
Cool.

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:39.050
So other than that
little factor,

00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:40.216
these are the right answers.

00:23:40.216 --> 00:23:41.960
You have to know
about Van Emde Boas.

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:43.460
You have to know
about fusion trees.

00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:45.380
And so this lecture is
about Van Emde Boas.

00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:48.890
Next lecture is
about fusion trees.

00:23:48.890 --> 00:24:05.040
This result is from 2006
and 2007, so pretty recent.

00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:07.100
So let's start a Van Emde Boas.

00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:40.049
Yeah.

00:24:40.049 --> 00:24:40.840
Let's dive into it.

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:44.160
I'll talk about
history a little later.

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:45.800
The central idea,
I guess, if you

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:49.530
wanted to sum up Van Emde
Boas in an equation, which

00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:52.980
is something we very rarely
get to do in algorithms,

00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:55.115
is to think about
this recurrence--

00:24:55.115 --> 00:25:00.430
T of u is T of square
root of u plus order 1.

00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:02.310
What does this solve to?

00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:05.470
log log u.

00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:10.080
All right, just
think of taking logs.

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:13.470
This is the same as
T of w equals T of w

00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:15.930
over 2 plus order 1.

00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:17.600
w is the word size.

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:19.470
And so this is log w.

00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:22.188
It's the same thing.

00:25:22.188 --> 00:25:25.410
If we could achieve
this recurrence, then--

00:25:25.410 --> 00:25:28.090
boom-- we get our
bound of log w.

00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:32.800
So how do we do it.

00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:45.480
We split the universe
into root u clusters,

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:48.290
each of size root u.

00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:59.940
OK, so, if here is our
universe, then I just

00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:03.090
split every square
root of u items.

00:26:03.090 --> 00:26:06.870
So each of these is root u long.

00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:09.132
The number of them
is square root of u.

00:26:09.132 --> 00:26:10.590
And then somehow,
I want to recurse

00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:14.460
on each of these clusters.

00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:16.400
And I only get to
recurse on one of them--

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:17.400
so a pretty simple idea.

00:26:34.550 --> 00:26:35.080
Yeah.

00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:36.621
So I'll talk about
how to actually do

00:26:36.621 --> 00:26:37.810
that recursion in a moment.

00:26:37.810 --> 00:26:39.309
Before I get there,
I want to define

00:26:39.309 --> 00:26:43.790
a sort of hierarchical
coordinate system.

00:26:43.790 --> 00:26:46.730
This is a new way of
phrasing it for me.

00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:48.790
So I hope you like it.

00:26:48.790 --> 00:26:52.510
If we have a word x, I
want to write it as two

00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:55.440
coordinates-- c and i.

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:57.470
I'm going to use
angle brackets, so it

00:26:57.470 --> 00:27:00.700
doesn't get too confusing. c
is which cluster you're in.

00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:03.970
So this is cluster 0, cluster
1, cluster 2, cluster three.

00:27:03.970 --> 00:27:05.820
i is your index
within the cluster.

00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:09.437
So this is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4,
5-- up to root u minus 1

00:27:09.437 --> 00:27:10.270
within this cluster.

00:27:10.270 --> 00:27:12.670
Then 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
up to root u minus 1

00:27:12.670 --> 00:27:15.220
with in this
cluster-- so the i is

00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:19.720
your index within the
cluster, like this,

00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:23.750
and c is which
cluster you are in.

00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:24.250
OK.

00:27:24.250 --> 00:27:25.540
Pretty simple.

00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:29.260
And there's easy
arithmetic to do this.

00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:33.430
c is x integer divide root u.

00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:38.200
And i is x integer mod root u.

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:41.560
I used Python notation here.

00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:44.517
So fine, I think
you all know this--

00:27:44.517 --> 00:27:45.100
pretty simple.

00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:47.230
And if I gave you
c and i, you could

00:27:47.230 --> 00:27:49.070
reconstruct x by just
saying, oh, well,

00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:52.600
that's c times root u plus i.

00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:55.690
So in constant time, you
can decompose a number

00:27:55.690 --> 00:27:56.950
into its two coordinates.

00:27:56.950 --> 00:27:59.581
That's the point.

00:27:59.581 --> 00:28:01.080
In fact, it's much
easier than this.

00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:02.950
You don't even
have to do division

00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:04.910
if you think of
everything in binary,

00:28:04.910 --> 00:28:06.580
which computers tend to do.

00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:16.560
So the binary perspective
is that x is a word.

00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:18.410
So it's a bunch of bits.

00:28:18.410 --> 00:28:25.000
0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0,
0, 1-- whatever.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:29.440
Divide that bit sequence
in half, and then this part

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:32.920
is c, this part is i.

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:35.740
And if you assume that
w is a power of 2,

00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:37.012
these two are identical.

00:28:37.012 --> 00:28:38.470
If they're not a
power of 2, you've

00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:40.600
got to round a little bit here.

00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:42.470
It doesn't matter.

00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:46.190
But you can use this definition
instead of this one either way.

00:28:46.190 --> 00:28:48.430
So in this case, c is--

00:28:48.430 --> 00:28:54.100
ooh, boy-- x shifted
right, w over 2, basically.

00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:58.100
So this w over 2--

00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:00.220
w over 2.

00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:04.220
The whole thing is w bits.

00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:07.150
So if I shift right, I get
rid of the low order bits,

00:29:07.150 --> 00:29:08.240
if I want.

00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:10.120
i is slightly more annoying.

00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:18.070
But I can't do it
as an and with one

00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:24.690
shifted left w over 2 minus 1.

00:29:24.690 --> 00:29:26.290
That's probably
how you do it in c.

00:29:26.290 --> 00:29:27.190
I don't know if
you're used to this.

00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:29.470
But if I take it a 1 bit,
I shift it over to here,

00:29:29.470 --> 00:29:30.310
and I subtract 1.

00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:31.900
Then I get a whole
bunch of 1 bits.

00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:34.660
And then you mask
with that bit pattern.

00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:36.850
So I'm masking with 1, 1, 1, 1.

00:29:36.850 --> 00:29:38.890
Then I'll just get
the low order bits.

00:29:38.890 --> 00:29:40.900
Computers do the
super fast-- way

00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:42.610
faster than integer division.

00:29:42.610 --> 00:29:44.830
Because this is just
like routing bits around.

00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:47.770
So this is easy to
do on a typical CPU.

00:29:47.770 --> 00:29:49.720
And this will be much
faster than this code,

00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:53.440
even though looks like
more operations, typically.

00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:54.010
All right.

00:29:54.010 --> 00:29:54.940
So fine.

00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:58.090
The point is, I can
decompos x into c and i.

00:29:58.090 --> 00:30:01.410
Of course, I can
also do the reverse.

00:30:01.410 --> 00:30:06.355
This would be c shifted
left w over 2, ord with i.

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:11.920
It's a slight diversion.

00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:15.400
Now, I can tell you
the actual recursion,

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:19.240
and then talk about
how to maintain it.

00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:24.580
So we're going to define
a recursive Van Emde Boas

00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:32.280
structure of size
u and word size w.

00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:39.670
And what it's going
to look like is,

00:30:39.670 --> 00:30:48.830
we have a bunch of clusters,
each of size square root of u.

00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:56.747
So this represents the
first root u items.

00:30:56.747 --> 00:30:58.330
This represents the
next root u items.

00:30:58.330 --> 00:31:01.100
This represents the last
root u items, and so on.

00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:03.710
So that's the obvious
recursion from this.

00:31:03.710 --> 00:31:05.540
So this is going to
be a Van Emde Boas

00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:07.850
structure of size root u.

00:31:07.850 --> 00:31:09.980
And then we also
have a structure

00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:14.930
up top, which is called
the summary structure.

00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:19.250
And the idea is, it represents,
for each of these clusters,

00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:21.620
is the cluster empty or not?

00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:24.620
Does this cluster
have any items in it?

00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:25.770
Yes or no.

00:31:25.770 --> 00:31:28.940
If yes, then the
name of this cluster

00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:31.340
is in the summary structure.

00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:33.950
So notice, by this
hierarchical decomposition,

00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:37.340
the cluster number
and the index are

00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:40.020
valid names of items
within these substructures.

00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:43.977
And basically we're going to use
the i part to talk about things

00:31:43.977 --> 00:31:44.810
within the clusters.

00:31:44.810 --> 00:31:46.640
And we're going to use the
c part to talk about things

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:47.848
within the summary structure.

00:31:47.848 --> 00:31:50.280
They're both numbers between
0 and root u minus 1.

00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:54.170
And so we get this perspective.

00:31:54.170 --> 00:31:54.830
All right.

00:31:54.830 --> 00:32:01.730
So formally, or some
notation, cluster i--

00:32:01.730 --> 00:32:05.300
so we're going to have
an array of clusters.

00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:10.470
It is Van Emde Boas thing
of size square root u,

00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:15.620
and word size w over 2.

00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:19.100
This is slightly weird,
because the machine, of course,

00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:20.630
its word size remains w.

00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:22.890
It doesn't get smaller
as you recurse.

00:32:22.890 --> 00:32:24.890
We're not going to try
to spread the parallelism

00:32:24.890 --> 00:32:26.950
around or whatever.

00:32:26.950 --> 00:32:28.700
But this is just a
notational convenience.

00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:31.340
I want to say the
word size conceptually

00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:34.040
goes down to w over 2, so
that this definition still

00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:35.270
makes sense.

00:32:35.270 --> 00:32:38.480
Because as I look at a
smaller part of the word,

00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:41.690
in order to divide it in
half, I have to shift right

00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:42.950
by a smaller amount.

00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:47.330
So that's the w that I'm
passing into the structure.

00:32:47.330 --> 00:32:52.710
OK, and then v dot
summary is same thing.

00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:58.110
It's also Van Emde Boa's
thing of size root u.

00:32:58.110 --> 00:33:01.550
Then the one other clever idea,
which makes all of this work,

00:33:01.550 --> 00:33:05.040
is that we store the minimum
element in v dot min.

00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:13.144
And we do not store
it recursively.

00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:27.080
So there's also one item here,
size 1, which is the min.

00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:28.530
It's just stored
off to the side.

00:33:28.530 --> 00:33:30.590
It doesn't live in
these structures.

00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:33.204
Every other item
lives down here.

00:33:33.204 --> 00:33:35.120
And furthermore, if one
of these is not empty,

00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:38.750
there's also a
corresponding item up here.

00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:43.880
This turns out to be crucial
to make a Van Emde Boas work.

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:46.850
And then v dot
max, we also need--

00:33:46.850 --> 00:33:48.382
but it can be
stored recursively.

00:33:48.382 --> 00:33:50.090
So just think of it
as a copy of whatever

00:33:50.090 --> 00:33:52.632
the maximum element is.

00:33:52.632 --> 00:33:54.590
OK, so in constant time,
we can compute the min

00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:55.520
and compute the max.

00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:56.150
That's good.

00:33:56.150 --> 00:33:59.840
But then I claim also in log
w time-- log log u time--

00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:02.492
we can do insert, delete,
predecessor, successor.

00:34:08.889 --> 00:34:09.770
So let's do that.

00:34:22.380 --> 00:34:24.040
This data structure--
the solution

00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:26.364
is both simple and
a little bit subtle.

00:34:26.364 --> 00:34:28.030
And so this will be
one of the few times

00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:30.250
I'm going to write
explicit pseudocode-- say

00:34:30.250 --> 00:34:33.400
exactly how to maintain
this data structure.

00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:35.320
It's short code, which is good.

00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:38.739
Each algorithm is
only a few lines.

00:34:38.739 --> 00:34:40.301
But every line matters.

00:34:40.301 --> 00:34:42.550
So I want to write them down
so I can talk about them.

00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:49.030
And with this new
hierarchical notation,

00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:52.460
I think it's even easier
to write these down.

00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:54.690
Let's see how I do.

00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:10.934
OK, so we'll start with
the successor code.

00:36:10.934 --> 00:36:12.350
Predecessor is,
of course, metric.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:31.624
And it basically has two cases.

00:36:31.624 --> 00:36:33.540
There's a special case
in the beginning, which

00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:36.270
is, if the thing you're
querying happens to be less

00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:38.670
than the minimum of the
whole thing, then of course,

00:36:38.670 --> 00:36:40.572
the minimum is the successor.

00:36:40.572 --> 00:36:42.780
This has to be done specially,
because the min is not

00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:43.987
stored recursively.

00:36:43.987 --> 00:36:45.570
And so you've got
to check for the min

00:36:45.570 --> 00:36:48.251
every single level
of the recursion.

00:36:48.251 --> 00:36:49.500
But that's just constant time.

00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:50.334
No big deal.

00:36:50.334 --> 00:36:51.750
Then the interesting
things is, we

00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:54.420
have recursions in both sides--

00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:58.150
in both cases-- but only one.

00:36:58.150 --> 00:37:00.380
The key is, we want
this recurrence--

00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:05.820
T of u is 1 times T of
root u plus order 1.

00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:07.460
That gives us log log u.

00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:12.760
If there was a 2 here, we would
get log u, which is no good.

00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:13.560
We want the one.

00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:16.810
So in one case, we call
successor on a cluster.

00:37:16.810 --> 00:37:18.630
In the other case,
we call successor

00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:22.230
on the summary structure.

00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:24.840
But we don't want to do both.

00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:27.900
So let's just think about,
intuitively, what's going on.

00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:29.420
We've got this--

00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:31.200
I guess I can do it
in the same picture.

00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:34.710
We've got this summary
and a bunch of clusters.

00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:36.870
And let's say you want
to compute, what's

00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:39.040
the successor of this item?

00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:40.830
So via this
transformation, we compute

00:37:40.830 --> 00:37:44.100
which cluster it lives in and
where it is within the cluster.

00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:45.040
That's i.

00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:46.560
So it's some item here.

00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:49.650
Now, it could be the successor
is inside the same cluster.

00:37:49.650 --> 00:37:51.870
Maybe there's an
item right there.

00:37:51.870 --> 00:37:54.330
Then want to recurse in here.

00:37:54.330 --> 00:37:57.090
Or it could be, it's
in some future cluster.

00:38:00.570 --> 00:38:02.910
Let's do the first case.

00:38:02.910 --> 00:38:08.190
If, basically, we are less than
the max of our own cluster,

00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:12.064
that means that the
answer is in there.

00:38:12.064 --> 00:38:13.980
Figure out what the max
is in this structure--

00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:18.780
the rightmost item in s
that's inside this cluster c.

00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:21.300
This is c.

00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:25.845
If our index is less than the
max's index, then if we recurse

00:38:25.845 --> 00:38:28.219
in here, we will find an answer.

00:38:28.219 --> 00:38:29.760
If we're bigger than
the max, then we

00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:31.051
won't find an answer down here.

00:38:31.051 --> 00:38:32.770
We have to recurse
somewhere else.

00:38:32.770 --> 00:38:34.890
So that's what we do.

00:38:34.890 --> 00:38:37.500
If we're less than
the max, then we just

00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:42.090
recursively find the successor
of our index within cluster c.

00:38:42.090 --> 00:38:45.630
And we have to add
on the c in front.

00:38:45.630 --> 00:38:47.460
Because successor
within this cluster

00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:50.370
will only give an index
within the cluster.

00:38:50.370 --> 00:38:54.620
And we have to prepend this
c part to give a global name.

00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:56.070
OK, so that's case 1.

00:38:56.070 --> 00:38:57.520
Very easy.

00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:01.590
The other case is where we're
slightly clever, in some sense.

00:39:01.590 --> 00:39:06.630
We say, OK, well, if there's no
successor within the cluster,

00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:08.040
maybe it's in the next cluster.

00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:09.660
Of course, that one might
be empty, in which case,

00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:10.480
it's in the next cluster.

00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:13.050
But that one might be empty,
so look at the next cluster.

00:39:13.050 --> 00:39:15.630
We need to find, what is
the next non-empty cluster?

00:39:15.630 --> 00:39:19.020
For that, we use the
summary structure.

00:39:19.020 --> 00:39:22.230
So we go up to position c here.

00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:25.400
We say, OK, what is the next
non-empty structure after c?

00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:27.950
Because we know that's
going to be where

00:39:27.950 --> 00:39:30.187
our answer lives for successor.

00:39:30.187 --> 00:39:31.770
So that's going to
give us, basically,

00:39:31.770 --> 00:39:36.750
a pointer to one of these
structures-- c prime, which--

00:39:36.750 --> 00:39:38.249
all these guys are empty.

00:39:38.249 --> 00:39:39.790
And so there's no
successor in there.

00:39:39.790 --> 00:39:43.150
The successor is then the
min in this structure.

00:39:43.150 --> 00:39:44.160
So that's all we do.

00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:48.130
Compute the successor of c
in the summary structure.

00:39:48.130 --> 00:39:51.900
And then, in that
cluster, c prime,

00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:54.240
find the min, which
takes constant time,

00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:59.060
and then prepend c prime to
that to get a global name.

00:39:59.060 --> 00:40:01.320
And that's our successor.

00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:01.970
Yeah, question.

00:40:01.970 --> 00:40:05.864
AUDIENCE: Could you repeat
why min is not recursive?

00:40:05.864 --> 00:40:07.238
Because looking
at this, it looks

00:40:07.238 --> 00:40:10.368
like all these smaller
[INAUDIBLE] trees have

00:40:10.368 --> 00:40:12.715
[INAUDIBLE]

00:40:12.715 --> 00:40:13.590
ERIK DEMAINE: Ah, OK.

00:40:13.590 --> 00:40:14.295
Sorry.

00:40:14.295 --> 00:40:16.505
The question is, why is
the minimum not recursive?

00:40:16.505 --> 00:40:18.380
The answer to that
question is not yet clear.

00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:19.890
It will have to
do with insertion.

00:40:19.890 --> 00:40:22.060
But I think what
exactly this means,

00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:25.440
I maybe didn't state
carefully enough.

00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:28.020
Every Van Emde Boas
structure has a min--

00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:29.460
stores a min.

00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:32.080
In that sense, this is done--

00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:34.320
that's funny-- not
so recursively.

00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:36.180
But every one stores it.

00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:38.850
The point is that
this item doesn't

00:40:38.850 --> 00:40:40.740
get put into one
of these clusters

00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:42.670
recursively-- just the item.

00:40:42.670 --> 00:40:44.310
But each of these
has its own min,

00:40:44.310 --> 00:40:46.620
which is then not stored
at the next level down.

00:40:46.620 --> 00:40:48.720
And each of those has
its own min, which is not

00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:50.190
stored at the next level down.

00:40:50.190 --> 00:40:52.444
Think of this as kind
of like a little buffer.

00:40:52.444 --> 00:40:54.360
The first time I insert
it into the structure,

00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:55.568
I just stick it into the min.

00:40:55.568 --> 00:40:57.787
I don't touch anything else.

00:40:57.787 --> 00:40:59.870
You'll see when we get to
the insertion algorithm.

00:40:59.870 --> 00:41:02.430
But it sort of slows
things down from trickling.

00:41:02.430 --> 00:41:07.126
AUDIENCE: So putting that min,
is that what prevents from--

00:41:07.126 --> 00:41:09.000
ERIK DEMAINE: That will
prevent the insertion

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.051
from doing two recursions
instead of one.

00:41:11.051 --> 00:41:12.300
So we'll see that in a moment.

00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:15.379
At this point, just
successor is very clear.

00:41:15.379 --> 00:41:17.920
This would work whether the min
is stored recursively or not.

00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:20.440
But we need to know what the
min is of every structure,

00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:23.382
and we need to know the
max of every structure.

00:41:23.382 --> 00:41:25.840
At this point, you could just
say that min and max could be

00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:27.610
copies-- no big deal--

00:41:27.610 --> 00:41:28.550
and we'd be happy.

00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:31.294
And of course, predecessor
does the same thing.

00:41:31.294 --> 00:41:33.710
So the slight cleverness here
is that we use the min here.

00:41:33.710 --> 00:41:36.640
This could have been a successor
operation with minus infinity

00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:37.840
as the query.

00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:40.120
But that would be
two recursions.

00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:41.137
We can only afford one.

00:41:41.137 --> 00:41:42.970
Fortunately, it's the
min item that we need.

00:41:42.970 --> 00:41:45.740
So we're done with successor.

00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:46.870
That was the easy case--

00:41:46.870 --> 00:41:47.800
or the easy one.

00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:50.710
Insert is slightly harder.

00:41:50.710 --> 00:41:53.065
Delete is just slightly messier.

00:41:53.065 --> 00:41:54.570
It's basically the
same as insert.

00:41:59.610 --> 00:42:03.790
So insert-- let me
write the code again.

00:43:17.170 --> 00:43:20.340
Insertion also has
two main cases.

00:43:20.340 --> 00:43:22.620
There's this case,
and the other case.

00:43:22.620 --> 00:43:23.850
But there's no else here.

00:43:23.850 --> 00:43:25.650
This happens in both cases.

00:43:25.650 --> 00:43:27.900
And then there's some just
annoying little details

00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:28.800
at the beginning.

00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:31.410
Just like over here, we had to
check for the min specially,

00:43:31.410 --> 00:43:34.170
here, we've got to
update the min and max.

00:43:34.170 --> 00:43:37.836
And there's a special case,
which I haven't mentioned yet.

00:43:37.836 --> 00:43:44.700
v dot min-- special case is,
it will be this value, none,

00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:48.480
if the whole structure is empty.

00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:52.740
So this is the obvious way to
tell whether a structure is

00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:54.247
empty and has no min.

00:43:54.247 --> 00:43:55.830
Because if there's
any items in there,

00:43:55.830 --> 00:43:57.810
there's going to be
one in the min slot.

00:43:57.810 --> 00:44:00.410
So first thing we do is
check, is our structure empty?

00:44:00.410 --> 00:44:04.710
If it's empty, the min and the
max become the inserted item.

00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:06.050
We're done.

00:44:06.050 --> 00:44:07.410
So that's the easy case.

00:44:07.410 --> 00:44:11.820
We do not store it
recursively in here.

00:44:11.820 --> 00:44:14.580
That's what this means.

00:44:14.580 --> 00:44:17.894
This element does not get
stored in any of the clusters.

00:44:17.894 --> 00:44:20.310
If it's not the very first
item, or it's not the min item,

00:44:20.310 --> 00:44:24.520
then we're going to recursively
insert it into a cluster.

00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:29.130
So if we have x in
cluster c, we always

00:44:29.130 --> 00:44:36.840
insert index i into cluster
c, except if it's the min.

00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:39.480
Now, it could be where a
structure is non-empty.

00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:40.612
There is a min item there.

00:44:40.612 --> 00:44:41.820
But we are less than the min.

00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:43.650
In that case, we're the new
min, and we just swap those.

00:44:43.650 --> 00:44:45.733
And now, we have to
recursively insert the old min

00:44:45.733 --> 00:44:47.680
into the rest of the structure.

00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:49.290
So that's a simple case.

00:44:49.290 --> 00:44:50.930
Then we also have
to update v dot max,

00:44:50.930 --> 00:44:51.930
just in the obvious way.

00:44:51.930 --> 00:44:55.869
This is the easy way to
maintain v dot max in variant,

00:44:55.869 --> 00:44:56.910
that is the maximum item.

00:44:56.910 --> 00:45:00.240
OK, now we have the two cases.

00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:02.100
I mean, this is really
the obvious thing

00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:03.870
to get to do insertion.

00:45:03.870 --> 00:45:06.900
We have to update the
summary structure, meaning,

00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:10.020
if the cluster that we are
inserting into-- cluster c--

00:45:10.020 --> 00:45:13.330
is empty, that means it was not
yet in the summary structure.

00:45:13.330 --> 00:45:14.500
We need to put it in there.

00:45:14.500 --> 00:45:17.190
So we just insert c
into v dot summary--

00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:18.370
pretty obvious.

00:45:18.370 --> 00:45:24.044
And in all cases, we insert
our item into cluster c.

00:45:24.044 --> 00:45:25.710
This looks bad,
however, because there's

00:45:25.710 --> 00:45:27.820
two recursions in some cases.

00:45:27.820 --> 00:45:29.880
If this if doesn't hold,
it's one recursion.

00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:30.930
Everything's fine.

00:45:30.930 --> 00:45:34.320
So if the cluster was
already in use, great.

00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:35.770
This is one recursion.

00:45:35.770 --> 00:45:37.370
This is constant work.

00:45:37.370 --> 00:45:38.550
We're done.

00:45:38.550 --> 00:45:40.800
The worry is, if the
cluster was empty

00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:44.670
before, then this insertion
is a whole recursion.

00:45:44.670 --> 00:45:48.010
That's scary, because we can't
afford a second recursion.

00:45:48.010 --> 00:45:50.310
But it's all OK.

00:45:50.310 --> 00:45:53.160
Because if we do
this recursion, that

00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:56.250
means that this cluster
was empty, which means,

00:45:56.250 --> 00:45:59.910
in this recursion, we fall
into this very first case.

00:45:59.910 --> 00:46:01.950
That structure,
it's min is none.

00:46:01.950 --> 00:46:03.750
That's what we just checked for.

00:46:03.750 --> 00:46:06.572
If it's none, we do
constant work and stop.

00:46:06.572 --> 00:46:10.250
So everything's OK.

00:46:10.250 --> 00:46:13.170
If we recursed in the
summary structure,

00:46:13.170 --> 00:46:15.060
this recursion will be
a shallow recursion.

00:46:15.060 --> 00:46:16.290
It just does one thing.

00:46:16.290 --> 00:46:23.340
You could actually put this
code into this if case,

00:46:23.340 --> 00:46:25.050
and make this an else case.

00:46:25.050 --> 00:46:26.814
That's another way
to write the code.

00:46:26.814 --> 00:46:28.480
But this will be a
very short recursion.

00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:30.580
So either you just
do this recursion,

00:46:30.580 --> 00:46:32.160
which could be
expensive, or you just

00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:34.470
do this one, in which case,
we know this one was cheap.

00:46:34.470 --> 00:46:36.790
If this happens, we know
this will take constant time.

00:46:36.790 --> 00:46:39.660
So in both cases, we
get this recursion--

00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:43.200
square root of u plus constant.

00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:45.086
And so we get log
log u insertion.

00:46:48.507 --> 00:46:49.590
Do you want to see delete?

00:46:49.590 --> 00:46:51.410
I mean, it's basically
the same thing.

00:46:51.410 --> 00:46:53.995
It's in the notes.

00:46:53.995 --> 00:46:55.620
I mean, you do the
obvious thing, which

00:46:55.620 --> 00:46:57.919
is, you delete in the cluster.

00:46:57.919 --> 00:46:59.460
And then if it became
empty, you also

00:46:59.460 --> 00:47:02.550
have to delete in the
summary structure.

00:47:02.550 --> 00:47:05.510
So there's, again, a chance
that you do two recursions.

00:47:05.510 --> 00:47:08.130
But-- OK, I'm talking about it.

00:47:08.130 --> 00:47:10.920
Maybe I'll write a
little bit of the code.

00:47:17.672 --> 00:47:19.130
I think I won't
write all the code,

00:47:19.130 --> 00:47:20.450
though-- just the main stuff.

00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:31.130
So if we want to
delete, then basically,

00:47:31.130 --> 00:47:36.800
we delete in cluster c, index i.

00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:44.510
And then if the cluster
has become empty

00:47:44.510 --> 00:47:49.970
as a result of
that, then we have

00:47:49.970 --> 00:47:53.870
to delete cluster c from
the summary structure,

00:47:53.870 --> 00:47:56.240
so that our predecessor and
successor queries actually

00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:56.930
still work.

00:48:04.132 --> 00:48:05.590
OK, so that's the
bulk of the code.

00:48:05.590 --> 00:48:07.256
I mean, that's where
the action happens.

00:48:07.256 --> 00:48:09.190
And the worry would be,
in this if case, we're

00:48:09.190 --> 00:48:12.400
doing two recursive deletes.

00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:16.300
The claim is, if we
do this second delete,

00:48:16.300 --> 00:48:19.930
which is potentially expensive--
this one was really cheap--

00:48:19.930 --> 00:48:23.429
the claim is that emptying
a Van Emde Boas structure

00:48:23.429 --> 00:48:24.970
takes constant time--
like, if you're

00:48:24.970 --> 00:48:26.841
deleting the last element.

00:48:26.841 --> 00:48:27.340
Why?

00:48:27.340 --> 00:48:29.760
Because when you're
deleting the last element,

00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:32.260
it's in the min right here.

00:48:32.260 --> 00:48:35.020
Everything below it-- all
the recursive structures--

00:48:35.020 --> 00:48:36.670
will be empty if
there's only one item,

00:48:36.670 --> 00:48:37.919
because it will be right here.

00:48:37.919 --> 00:48:39.970
And you can check that
from the insertion.

00:48:39.970 --> 00:48:43.390
If it was empty, all we did was
change v dot min and v dot max.

00:48:43.390 --> 00:48:45.690
So the inverse, which
I want right here,

00:48:45.690 --> 00:48:48.350
is just to clear out v
dot min and v dot max.

00:48:48.350 --> 00:48:52.630
So if this ends up happening,
this only took constant time.

00:48:52.630 --> 00:48:55.570
You don't have to recurse when
you're deleting the last item.

00:48:55.570 --> 00:48:59.000
So in either case, you're really
only doing one deep recursion.

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:01.870
So you get the same recurrence,
and you get log log u.

00:49:01.870 --> 00:49:04.390
So for the details,
check out the notes.

00:49:04.390 --> 00:49:09.250
I want to go to other
perspectives of Van Emde Boas.

00:49:09.250 --> 00:49:11.110
This is one way
to think about it.

00:49:11.110 --> 00:49:14.260
And amusingly, and this is
probably the most taut way

00:49:14.260 --> 00:49:16.540
to do Van Emde Boas.

00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:19.120
It's, in CLRS,
described this way,

00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:21.967
because in 2001, when
I first came here,

00:49:21.967 --> 00:49:24.550
I presented Van Emde Boas like
this in an undergrad algorithms

00:49:24.550 --> 00:49:26.930
class with more details.

00:49:26.930 --> 00:49:29.500
You guys are grads, so I did
it like three times faster

00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:34.497
than I would in 6046.

00:49:34.497 --> 00:49:36.080
So now, it's in
textbooks and whatnot.

00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:37.640
But this is not
how Van Emde Boas

00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:39.832
presented this data
structure-- just out

00:49:39.832 --> 00:49:40.790
of historical interest.

00:49:40.790 --> 00:49:44.401
This is a way that I believe
was invented by Michael Bender

00:49:44.401 --> 00:49:46.400
and Martin Farach-Colton,
who are the co-authors

00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:48.080
on "Cache-oblivious B-trees."

00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:49.730
And around 2001,
they were looking

00:49:49.730 --> 00:49:52.680
at lots of old data structures
and simplifying them.

00:49:52.680 --> 00:49:54.800
And I think this is a
very clean, simple way

00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:56.429
to think about Van Emde Boas.

00:49:56.429 --> 00:49:58.220
But I want to tell you
the other way, which

00:49:58.220 --> 00:50:02.600
is the way it originally
appeared in their papers.

00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:05.840
There's actually three
papers by van Emde

00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:09.260
Boas about this structure.

00:50:09.260 --> 00:50:10.640
Many papers appear twice--

00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:12.770
once in a conference,
once in a journal--

00:50:12.770 --> 00:50:15.350
this one, there's
three relevant papers.

00:50:15.350 --> 00:50:18.105
There's conference
version, journal version.

00:50:18.105 --> 00:50:20.480
The only weird thing there is
that the conference version

00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:22.150
has one author-- van Emde Boas.

00:50:22.150 --> 00:50:24.130
The journal version
has three authors--

00:50:24.130 --> 00:50:28.135
van Emde Boas,
Kaas, and Zijlstra.

00:50:28.135 --> 00:50:30.260
And they're acknowledged
in the conference version,

00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:32.990
so I guess they
helped even more.

00:50:32.990 --> 00:50:35.540
In particular, they, I think,
implemented this data structure

00:50:35.540 --> 00:50:36.180
for the first time.

00:50:36.180 --> 00:50:37.554
It's a really easy
data structure

00:50:37.554 --> 00:50:38.860
to implement, and very fast.

00:50:41.370 --> 00:50:43.400
Then there's a third
paper by van Emde Boas

00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:47.010
only in a journal which
improves the space a little bit.

00:50:47.010 --> 00:50:50.860
So we'll see a little
bit what that's about.

00:50:50.860 --> 00:50:52.610
But what I like about
both of these papers

00:50:52.610 --> 00:51:00.140
is they offer a simpler way
to get log log u, successor,

00:51:00.140 --> 00:51:01.490
predecessor.

00:51:01.490 --> 00:51:04.490
Let's not worry about insertions
and deletions for a little bit,

00:51:04.490 --> 00:51:08.990
and take what I'll call
the simple tree view.

00:51:14.660 --> 00:51:18.150
So I'm going to draw a picture--

00:51:18.150 --> 00:51:21.760
0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0--

00:51:27.780 --> 00:51:29.720
OK.

00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:36.200
This is what we call a bit
vector, meaning, here's

00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:38.510
item zero, item one, item two.

00:51:38.510 --> 00:51:42.195
And here is u minus 1.

00:51:42.195 --> 00:51:45.470
And I'll put a 1 if that
element is in my set, and a 0

00:51:45.470 --> 00:51:47.280
otherwise.

00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:51.680
OK, so one is in the set, nine--

00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:55.190
I think-- is in the set,
10, and 15 are in the set.

00:51:58.597 --> 00:51:59.930
I kind of want to maintain this.

00:51:59.930 --> 00:52:00.980
This is, of course,
easy to maintain

00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:02.146
by insertions and deletions.

00:52:02.146 --> 00:52:03.740
I just flip a bit on or off.

00:52:03.740 --> 00:52:05.760
But I want to be able
to do successor queries.

00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:07.850
And if I want the
successor of, say, this 0,

00:52:07.850 --> 00:52:08.744
finding the next 1--

00:52:08.744 --> 00:52:10.160
I don't want to
have to walk down.

00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:12.890
That would take order
u time-- very bad.

00:52:12.890 --> 00:52:15.290
So obvious thing to do is
build a tree on this thing.

00:52:20.990 --> 00:52:25.265
And I'm going to put in here
the or of the two children.

00:52:25.265 --> 00:52:27.140
Every node will store
the or of its children.

00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:32.990
And then keep building the tree.

00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:49.400
Now we have a binary tree,
with bits on the vertices.

00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:51.500
And I claim, if
I want to compute

00:52:51.500 --> 00:52:54.020
the successor of this
item, I can do it

00:52:54.020 --> 00:52:58.290
in a pretty natural way
in the log log u time.

00:52:58.290 --> 00:53:03.850
So keep in mind, this
height here is w--

00:53:03.850 --> 00:53:04.350
log u.

00:53:07.610 --> 00:53:09.270
So I need to achieve log w.

00:53:09.270 --> 00:53:12.740
So of course, you could try
just walking down this tree,

00:53:12.740 --> 00:53:14.660
or walking up and
then back down.

00:53:14.660 --> 00:53:17.510
That would take order w time.

00:53:17.510 --> 00:53:19.340
That's the obvious BST approach.

00:53:19.340 --> 00:53:21.600
I want to do log w.

00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:22.360
So how do I do it?

00:53:22.360 --> 00:53:27.626
I'm going to binary
search on the height.

00:53:27.626 --> 00:53:29.920
How could I binary
search on the height?

00:53:29.920 --> 00:53:33.340
Well, what I'd really like
to do, in some sense--

00:53:33.340 --> 00:53:37.570
if I look at the path of
this node to the route--

00:53:37.570 --> 00:53:40.940
where is my red chalk?

00:53:40.940 --> 00:53:43.710
So here's the path to the root.

00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:50.540
These bits are saying, is
there anybody down here?

00:53:50.540 --> 00:53:52.870
That's what the or gives you.

00:53:52.870 --> 00:53:55.540
So it's like the
summary structure.

00:53:55.540 --> 00:53:59.590
If I want to search for this
guy-- well, if I walked up,

00:53:59.590 --> 00:54:01.660
eventually, I find a 1.

00:54:01.660 --> 00:54:04.180
And that's when I find
the first nearby element.

00:54:04.180 --> 00:54:06.220
Now, in this case it's
not the successor I find.

00:54:06.220 --> 00:54:08.110
It's really the
predecessor I found.

00:54:08.110 --> 00:54:11.320
When you get to the first one--
the transition from 0 to 1--

00:54:11.320 --> 00:54:12.730
you look at your sibling--

00:54:12.730 --> 00:54:15.250
the other child of that one.

00:54:15.250 --> 00:54:19.210
And down in this subtree, there
will be either the predecessor

00:54:19.210 --> 00:54:20.274
or the successor.

00:54:20.274 --> 00:54:21.940
In this case, we've
got the predecessor,

00:54:21.940 --> 00:54:23.460
because it was to the left.

00:54:23.460 --> 00:54:25.140
We take the max
element in there,

00:54:25.140 --> 00:54:27.081
and that's the
predecessor of this item.

00:54:27.081 --> 00:54:29.080
If instead, we had found
this was our first one,

00:54:29.080 --> 00:54:30.856
then we look over
here, take the min--

00:54:30.856 --> 00:54:32.230
there's, of course,
nothing here.

00:54:32.230 --> 00:54:35.110
But in that situation,
the min over there

00:54:35.110 --> 00:54:36.670
would be our successor.

00:54:36.670 --> 00:54:39.220
So we can't guarantee
which one we find.

00:54:39.220 --> 00:54:42.130
But we will find either the
predecessor or the successor

00:54:42.130 --> 00:54:45.410
if we could find the first
transition from 0 to 1.

00:54:45.410 --> 00:54:47.470
And we can do that
via binary search,

00:54:47.470 --> 00:54:49.596
because this string is monotone.

00:54:49.596 --> 00:54:51.220
It's a whole bunch
of zeros for awhile,

00:54:51.220 --> 00:54:52.761
and then once you
get a 1, it's going

00:54:52.761 --> 00:54:54.730
to continue to be 1,
because those are or.

00:54:54.730 --> 00:54:55.880
That one will propagate up.

00:55:18.090 --> 00:55:21.210
So this is the new idea to
get log log u, predecessor,

00:55:21.210 --> 00:55:25.376
successor is to--

00:55:25.376 --> 00:55:34.555
let's say-- any root-to-leaf
path is monotone.

00:55:34.555 --> 00:55:37.090
It's 0 for awhile, and
then it becomes 1 forever.

00:55:40.550 --> 00:55:44.890
So we should be able to
binary search for the 0

00:55:44.890 --> 00:55:46.236
to 1 transition.

00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:57.470
And it either looks like
this, or it looks like this.

00:55:57.470 --> 00:56:04.745
So our query was somewhere
down here in the 0 part.

00:56:04.745 --> 00:56:06.370
I'm assuming that
our query is not a 1.

00:56:06.370 --> 00:56:08.990
Otherwise, it's an
immediate 0 to 1 transition.

00:56:08.990 --> 00:56:10.410
And that's a special case.

00:56:10.410 --> 00:56:11.770
It's easy to deal with.

00:56:11.770 --> 00:56:17.190
And then there's
the other tree--

00:56:17.190 --> 00:56:19.450
the sibling of x--

00:56:19.450 --> 00:56:22.810
the other child of the 1.

00:56:22.810 --> 00:56:25.870
And in this case, we
want to take the min.

00:56:25.870 --> 00:56:28.240
And that will give us
our successor of x.

00:56:31.540 --> 00:56:34.219
And in this case, we want
to take the max over here,

00:56:34.219 --> 00:56:36.010
and that will give us
the predecessor of x.

00:56:41.110 --> 00:56:42.860
So as long as we have
minimax of subtrees,

00:56:42.860 --> 00:56:44.690
this is constant time.

00:56:44.690 --> 00:56:47.480
We find either the
predecessor or the successor.

00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:49.400
Now, how do we
get the other one?

00:56:49.400 --> 00:56:50.330
Pretty easy.

00:56:50.330 --> 00:56:54.140
Just store a linked list
of all the items, in order.

00:56:54.140 --> 00:56:57.980
So I'm going to store a pointer
from this one to this one,

00:56:57.980 --> 00:56:59.390
and vice versa--

00:56:59.390 --> 00:57:01.020
and this one or this one.

00:57:01.020 --> 00:57:04.210
This is actually really
easy to maintain.

00:57:04.210 --> 00:57:07.394
Because when you insert,
if you can compute

00:57:07.394 --> 00:57:08.810
the predecessor
and the successor,

00:57:08.810 --> 00:57:10.280
you can just stick it
in the linked list.

00:57:10.280 --> 00:57:11.100
That's really easy.

00:57:11.100 --> 00:57:13.260
We know how to do
that in constant time.

00:57:13.260 --> 00:57:15.770
So once you do this, it's
enough to find one of them,

00:57:15.770 --> 00:57:17.270
as long as you know
which one it is.

00:57:17.270 --> 00:57:18.830
Because then you just
follow a pointer--

00:57:18.830 --> 00:57:19.990
either a forward or
a backward pointer--

00:57:19.990 --> 00:57:21.060
and you get the other one.

00:57:21.060 --> 00:57:22.268
So whichever one you wanted--

00:57:22.268 --> 00:57:24.350
you find both the
predecessor and successor

00:57:24.350 --> 00:57:26.690
at the cost of
finding either one.

00:57:26.690 --> 00:57:30.170
So that's a cute little trick.

00:57:30.170 --> 00:57:34.610
This is hard to maintain,
dynamically, at the moment.

00:57:34.610 --> 00:57:37.670
But this is, I think,
where the Van Emde Boas

00:57:37.670 --> 00:57:39.080
structure came from.

00:57:39.080 --> 00:57:42.830
It's nice to think about
it in the tree view.

00:57:42.830 --> 00:57:51.320
So we get log log you u,
predecessor, and successor.

00:57:54.260 --> 00:57:58.040
I should say what this relies on
is the ability to binary search

00:57:58.040 --> 00:57:59.750
on any route-to-node path.

00:57:59.750 --> 00:58:03.740
Now, there aren't enough
pointers to do that.

00:58:03.740 --> 00:58:04.680
So you have a choice.

00:58:04.680 --> 00:58:07.520
Either you realize,
oh, this is a bunch

00:58:07.520 --> 00:58:09.990
of bits in a
complete binary tree,

00:58:09.990 --> 00:58:14.090
so I can store them
sequentially in array.

00:58:14.090 --> 00:58:18.050
And given a particular node
position in that array,

00:58:18.050 --> 00:58:20.660
I can compute, what is
the second ancestor,

00:58:20.660 --> 00:58:23.970
or the fourth ancestor or
whatever, in constant time.

00:58:23.970 --> 00:58:26.330
I just do some arithmetic
and I can compute from here

00:58:26.330 --> 00:58:27.205
where to go to there.

00:58:27.205 --> 00:58:29.630
It's like the regular old
heaps, but a little bit

00:58:29.630 --> 00:58:31.255
embellished, because
you have to divide

00:58:31.255 --> 00:58:33.540
by a larger power of two,
not just one of them.

00:58:33.540 --> 00:58:36.000
So that's one way to do it.

00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:39.310
So in a RAM, that
all works fine.

00:58:39.310 --> 00:58:42.145
When van Emde Boas wrote this
paper, though, the RAM didn't--

00:58:42.145 --> 00:58:43.490
it kind of existed.

00:58:43.490 --> 00:58:45.590
It just wasn't as
well-developed then.

00:58:45.590 --> 00:58:49.520
And the hot thing at the
time was the pointer machine,

00:58:49.520 --> 00:58:52.310
or I guess at that point, they
called it the Pascal machine,

00:58:52.310 --> 00:58:53.690
more or less.

00:58:53.690 --> 00:58:55.280
Pascal does have arrays.

00:58:55.280 --> 00:58:59.660
And the funny thing is, Van
Emde Boas does use arrays,

00:58:59.660 --> 00:59:01.220
but mostly it's pointers.

00:59:01.220 --> 00:59:03.840
And you can get rid of the
arrays from their structure.

00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:07.040
And essentially, in
the end, Van Emde Boas,

00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:10.744
as presented like this,
is in a pointer machine.

00:59:10.744 --> 00:59:12.410
Let me tell you a
little bit about that.

00:59:16.440 --> 00:59:28.040
So original Van Emde Boas, which
I'll call stratified trees--

00:59:28.040 --> 00:59:30.980
that's what he called it--

00:59:30.980 --> 00:59:35.520
is basically this tree structure
with a lot more pointers.

00:59:35.520 --> 00:59:39.500
So in particular, each leaf--

00:59:39.500 --> 00:59:42.000
or every node,
actually, let's say--

00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:54.080
stores a pointer to 2
to the ith ancestor,

00:59:54.080 --> 01:00:02.123
where i is 0, 1, up to log w.

01:00:02.123 --> 01:00:04.590
Because it was the
2 to the-- here.

01:00:04.590 --> 01:00:08.047
So once you get the
ancestor immediately

01:00:08.047 --> 01:00:10.130
above me, two steps above
me, four steps above me,

01:00:10.130 --> 01:00:11.880
eight steps above me,
that's what I really

01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:13.700
need to do this binary search.

01:00:13.700 --> 01:00:16.094
The first thing I
need is halfway up.

01:00:16.094 --> 01:00:17.510
And then if I have
to go down, I'm

01:00:17.510 --> 01:00:19.310
going to need a
quarter of the way up.

01:00:19.310 --> 01:00:21.800
And if I have to go down, I
want an eighth of the way up.

01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:25.110
Whenever I go up, from-- if
I decide, oh, this is a 0.

01:00:25.110 --> 01:00:26.432
I've got to go above here.

01:00:26.432 --> 01:00:27.890
Then I do the same
thing from here.

01:00:27.890 --> 01:00:29.970
I want to go halfway
up from here--

01:00:29.970 --> 01:00:30.830
from this node.

01:00:30.830 --> 01:00:36.140
So as long as every node knows
how to go up by any power of 2,

01:00:36.140 --> 01:00:36.800
we're golden.

01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:39.396
We can do a binary search.

01:00:39.396 --> 01:00:41.270
The trouble with this
is, it increases space.

01:00:41.270 --> 01:00:47.560
This is u log w space, which
is a little bit bigger than u.

01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:50.060
And the original van Emde Boas
paper, conference and journal

01:00:50.060 --> 01:00:51.830
version, achieves this bound--

01:00:51.830 --> 01:00:53.210
not u.

01:00:53.210 --> 01:00:55.790
Little historical fun fact--

01:00:55.790 --> 01:00:58.250
not terribly well known.

01:00:58.250 --> 01:00:58.790
Cool.

01:00:58.790 --> 01:01:01.235
So that's stratified trees.

01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:08.100
Anything else?

01:01:08.100 --> 01:01:08.600
All right.

01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:09.680
Stratified tree.

01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:10.730
Right.

01:01:10.730 --> 01:01:13.547
At this point, we have fast
search, but slow update let.

01:01:13.547 --> 01:01:15.130
Me tell you about
updates in a second.

01:01:15.130 --> 01:01:16.080
Yeah, question.

01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:19.002
AUDIENCE: So once you do binary
search to find the first 1,

01:01:19.002 --> 01:01:22.910
how do you walk
back down the tree--

01:01:22.910 --> 01:01:24.400
ERIK DEMAINE: Oh,
I didn't mention,

01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:26.360
but also, every node
stores min and max.

01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:36.950
So that lets me do the
teleportation back down.

01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:39.570
Every node knows the min
and the max of its subtree.

01:01:39.570 --> 01:01:40.070
Right.

01:01:40.070 --> 01:01:42.917
One more thing I was
forgetting here--

01:01:42.917 --> 01:01:44.750
when I say, this a lot
of pointers to store.

01:01:44.750 --> 01:01:47.330
You can't store them
all in one node.

01:01:47.330 --> 01:01:50.220
And in the van Emde Boas
paper, it's stored in an array.

01:01:50.220 --> 01:01:51.470
But it doesn't really
need that its an array.

01:01:51.470 --> 01:01:53.120
It could just as well
be a linked list.

01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:56.600
And that's how you
get pointer machine.

01:01:56.600 --> 01:01:59.486
So this could be linked list.

01:01:59.486 --> 01:02:01.610
And then this whole thing
works in pointer machine,

01:02:01.610 --> 01:02:03.230
which is kind of neat.

01:02:03.230 --> 01:02:07.479
And it's a little weird,
because if you used a comparison

01:02:07.479 --> 01:02:09.770
pointer machine, where all
you can do is compare items,

01:02:09.770 --> 01:02:12.110
there's a lower bound of
log n, because you only

01:02:12.110 --> 01:02:14.780
have branching factor constant.

01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:18.620
But here, the formulation of
the problem is, when I say,

01:02:18.620 --> 01:02:20.480
give me the successor
of this, I actually

01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:23.967
give you a pointer to this item.

01:02:23.967 --> 01:02:26.300
And then from there, you can
do all this jumping around,

01:02:26.300 --> 01:02:28.520
and find your
predecessor or successor.

01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:30.830
So in this world, you
need at least u space,

01:02:30.830 --> 01:02:32.555
even to be able to
specify the input.

01:02:35.290 --> 01:02:37.750
So that's kind of a limitation
of the pointer machine.

01:02:37.750 --> 01:02:39.958
And you can actually show
in the pointer machine log,

01:02:39.958 --> 01:02:46.070
log u is optimal for any
predecessor data structure

01:02:46.070 --> 01:02:47.510
in the pointer machine.

01:02:47.510 --> 01:02:53.567
So there's a matching lower
bound log log u in this model.

01:02:53.567 --> 01:02:54.650
And you need to use space.

01:02:54.650 --> 01:02:56.020
So it's not very exciting.

01:02:56.020 --> 01:02:58.120
What we like is the word RAM.

01:02:58.120 --> 01:03:00.070
There, we can reduce space to n.

01:03:00.070 --> 01:03:03.400
And that's what I want
to do next, I believe--

01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:04.780
almost next.

01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:08.380
One more mention--
actual stratified trees--

01:03:08.380 --> 01:03:11.110
here, we got query
fast, update slow.

01:03:11.110 --> 01:03:13.990
Stratified trees actually
do update fast, as well.

01:03:13.990 --> 01:03:17.710
Essentially, it's this idea,
plus you don't recursively

01:03:17.710 --> 01:03:20.290
store the min, which,
of course, makes

01:03:20.290 --> 01:03:21.900
all these bits no
longer accurate,

01:03:21.900 --> 01:03:23.740
as it gets much messier.

01:03:23.740 --> 01:03:26.800
But in the end, it's doing
exactly the same thing

01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:28.175
as this recursion.

01:03:28.175 --> 01:03:30.100
In fact, you can
draw the picture.

01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:35.870
It is this part up here--

01:03:35.870 --> 01:03:37.330
the top half of the tree--

01:03:37.330 --> 01:03:38.130
this is summary.

01:03:41.110 --> 01:03:46.408
And each of these bottom
halves is a cluster.

01:03:46.408 --> 01:03:51.820
And there's root u
clusters down here.

01:03:51.820 --> 01:03:53.500
So those are smaller structures.

01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:57.610
And there's one root u sized
Van Emde Boas structure, which

01:03:57.610 --> 01:03:58.900
is a summary structure.

01:03:58.900 --> 01:04:02.617
These bits here is the
bit vector representation

01:04:02.617 --> 01:04:03.700
of the summary structures.

01:04:03.700 --> 01:04:05.283
It's, is there anyone
in this cluster?

01:04:05.283 --> 01:04:08.597
Is there anyone in this
cluster, and so on?

01:04:08.597 --> 01:04:10.930
This, of course, also looks
a lot like the Van Emde Boas

01:04:10.930 --> 01:04:11.650
layout.

01:04:11.650 --> 01:04:14.137
Take a binary tree, cut
it in half, do the top,

01:04:14.137 --> 01:04:15.220
recursively do the bottom.

01:04:15.220 --> 01:04:17.428
So that's why it was called
the Van Emde Boas layout,

01:04:17.428 --> 01:04:18.791
is this picture.

01:04:18.791 --> 01:04:20.290
But if you take
this tree structure,

01:04:20.290 --> 01:04:22.039
and then you don't
recursively store mins,

01:04:22.039 --> 01:04:24.880
and then the bits are not
quite accurate, it's messy.

01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:26.769
And so stratified
trees-- you should

01:04:26.769 --> 01:04:28.060
try to read the original paper.

01:04:28.060 --> 01:04:28.870
It's a mess.

01:04:28.870 --> 01:04:31.640
Whereas this code--
pretty clean.

01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:33.280
And so once you
say, oh, I'm just

01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:35.440
going to store all these
clusters as an array

01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:37.540
and not worry about
keeping track of the tree,

01:04:37.540 --> 01:04:39.620
it actually gets a lot easier.

01:04:39.620 --> 01:04:43.090
And that was the
Bender/Farach-Colton cleaning

01:04:43.090 --> 01:04:44.920
up, which never
appeared in print.

01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:48.380
But it's appeared in the lecture
notes all over the place--

01:04:48.380 --> 01:04:50.700
and now CLRS.

01:04:50.700 --> 01:04:51.940
Cool.

01:04:51.940 --> 01:04:53.656
I want to tell you
about two more things.

01:04:53.656 --> 01:04:55.030
It's actually
going to get easier

01:04:55.030 --> 01:04:57.989
the more time we spend
with this data structure.

01:05:21.970 --> 01:05:24.790
All right.

01:05:24.790 --> 01:05:27.970
Let me draw a box.

01:05:27.970 --> 01:05:31.930
At this point, we've seen a
clean way to get Van Emde Boas.

01:05:31.930 --> 01:05:34.570
And we've seen a
cute way in a tree

01:05:34.570 --> 01:05:37.240
to get search fast,
but update slow.

01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:39.280
I want to talk a
little more about that.

01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:41.200
Let's suppose I have
this data structure.

01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:46.120
It's achieves log w
query, which is fast,

01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:50.590
but it only achieves w
update, which is slow.

01:05:50.590 --> 01:05:52.270
How do you update the structure?

01:05:52.270 --> 01:05:54.010
You update one
bit at the bottom,

01:05:54.010 --> 01:05:56.980
and then you've got to update
all the bits up the path.

01:05:56.980 --> 01:05:59.590
So you spend w time to
do an update over here.

01:06:02.410 --> 01:06:05.680
If updates are slow, I just
want to do less updates.

01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:07.570
We have a trick for
doing this, which

01:06:07.570 --> 01:06:10.630
is, you put little things
down here of size theta w.

01:06:16.810 --> 01:06:19.810
And then only one item
from here gets promoted

01:06:19.810 --> 01:06:21.490
into the top structure.

01:06:21.490 --> 01:06:26.860
We only end up having n over
w items up here, and about 1

01:06:26.860 --> 01:06:29.050
over w as many updates.

01:06:29.050 --> 01:06:31.930
If I want to do an
insertion, I do a search here

01:06:31.930 --> 01:06:33.880
to figure out which
of these little--

01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:39.370
I'll call these "chunks--" which
little chunk it belongs in.

01:06:39.370 --> 01:06:41.800
I do an insert there.

01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:43.360
If that structure
gets too big-- it's

01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:45.730
bigger than, say, 2
times w, or 4 times w,

01:06:45.730 --> 01:06:48.516
whatever-- then I'll split it.

01:06:48.516 --> 01:06:50.765
And if I delete from something,
and it gets too small,

01:06:50.765 --> 01:06:53.330
I'll merge with the
neighbor, or maybe re-split--

01:06:53.330 --> 01:06:55.580
just like B-trees.

01:06:55.580 --> 01:06:58.820
We've done this
many times, by now.

01:06:58.820 --> 01:07:01.490
But only when it
splits, or I do a merge,

01:07:01.490 --> 01:07:03.050
do I have to do
an update up here.

01:07:03.050 --> 01:07:05.540
Only when the set
of chunks changes do

01:07:05.540 --> 01:07:07.790
I need to do a single
insertion or deletion

01:07:07.790 --> 01:07:10.100
up here-- or a constant number.

01:07:10.100 --> 01:07:15.860
So this update time goes
down by a factor of w.

01:07:15.860 --> 01:07:18.567
But I have to pay whatever
the update cost is here.

01:07:18.567 --> 01:07:20.150
So what I do with
this data structure?

01:07:20.150 --> 01:07:21.530
I don't want use Van
Emde Boas, because this

01:07:21.530 --> 01:07:22.580
could be a very big universe.

01:07:22.580 --> 01:07:23.205
Who knows what?

01:07:23.205 --> 01:07:26.360
I use the binary search tree.

01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:28.250
Here, I can afford a
binary search tree,

01:07:28.250 --> 01:07:30.610
because then it's only log w.

01:07:30.610 --> 01:07:32.914
log w is the bound
we're trying to get.

01:07:32.914 --> 01:07:34.580
So you can do these
binary search trees.

01:07:34.580 --> 01:07:35.490
It's trivial.

01:07:35.490 --> 01:07:37.970
Just do insert, delete, search.

01:07:37.970 --> 01:07:39.994
Everything will be log w.

01:07:39.994 --> 01:07:42.410
So if I want to do a search,
I search through here, which,

01:07:42.410 --> 01:07:44.476
conveniently, is
already fast-- log w--

01:07:44.476 --> 01:07:46.850
and then I do a search through
here, which is also log w.

01:07:46.850 --> 01:07:47.445
So it's nice and balanced.

01:07:47.445 --> 01:07:48.530
Everything's log w.

01:07:51.632 --> 01:07:53.840
If I want to do an insertion,
I do an insertion here.

01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:56.090
If it splits, I do
an insertion here.

01:07:56.090 --> 01:08:00.470
But that order w update
cost, I charge to the order

01:08:00.470 --> 01:08:02.660
w updates I would have
had to do in this chunk

01:08:02.660 --> 01:08:04.700
before it got split.

01:08:04.700 --> 01:08:08.060
So this our good friend
indirection, a technique we

01:08:08.060 --> 01:08:09.800
will use over and
over in this class.

01:08:09.800 --> 01:08:14.450
It's very helpful when you're
almost at the right bound.

01:08:14.450 --> 01:08:17.479
And that's actually in the
follow-up van Emde Boas paper.

01:08:17.479 --> 01:08:20.520
A similar indirection
trick is in there.

01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:31.370
So we can charge the
order w update in top to--

01:08:31.370 --> 01:08:33.020
that's the cost of the update--

01:08:33.020 --> 01:08:38.180
to the order w updates
that have actually

01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:42.740
been performed in the bottom.

01:08:42.740 --> 01:08:44.600
Because when
somebody gets split,

01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:47.330
it's nice in its average
state-- or when it gets merged,

01:08:47.330 --> 01:08:48.640
it's going to be close
to its average state.

01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:50.598
You have to do a lot of
insertions or deletions

01:08:50.598 --> 01:08:54.630
to get it out of whack, and
cause a split or a merge.

01:08:54.630 --> 01:08:56.000
So-- boom.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:01.700
This means the
updates become log w.

01:09:01.700 --> 01:09:04.130
Searches are also log w.

01:09:04.130 --> 01:09:07.550
So we've got Van Emde
Boas again, in a new way.

01:09:07.550 --> 01:09:11.127
Bonus points-- if you
take this structure--

01:09:14.330 --> 01:09:16.950
even this structure, if we
did it in the array form--

01:09:16.950 --> 01:09:17.450
great.

01:09:17.450 --> 01:09:18.890
It was order u space.

01:09:18.890 --> 01:09:20.750
If we did it with
all these pointers,

01:09:20.750 --> 01:09:22.708
and we wanted a pointer
machine data structure,

01:09:22.708 --> 01:09:25.589
we needed u log w space.

01:09:25.589 --> 01:09:28.130
But this indirection trick, you
can also get rid of the log w

01:09:28.130 --> 01:09:30.160
in space factor.

01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:31.340
It's a little less obvious.

01:09:31.340 --> 01:09:33.020
But you take this--

01:09:33.020 --> 01:09:34.859
here, we reduced n
by a factor of w.

01:09:34.859 --> 01:09:37.420
You can also reduce
u by a factor of w.

01:09:37.420 --> 01:09:38.420
I'll just wave my hands.

01:09:38.420 --> 01:09:39.500
That's possible.

01:09:39.500 --> 01:09:41.510
So u gets a little bit smaller.

01:09:41.510 --> 01:09:44.120
And so when we
pay u log w space,

01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:46.040
if you got smaller
by a factor of w,

01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:48.689
this basically disappears.

01:09:48.689 --> 01:09:50.580
So you get, at
most, order u space.

01:09:53.210 --> 01:09:54.390
But order u is not order n.

01:09:54.390 --> 01:09:56.550
I want order n space, darn it.

01:09:56.550 --> 01:10:01.400
So let's reduce space.

01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:04.015
As I said, this is going
to get easier and easier.

01:10:04.015 --> 01:10:06.390
By the end, we will have very
little of a data structure.

01:10:06.390 --> 01:10:10.150
But still, we'll have log log u.

01:10:10.150 --> 01:10:13.860
And you thought this was
easy, but wait, there's more.

01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:19.410
Right now, we have two
ways to get log log u--

01:10:19.410 --> 01:10:22.950
query and order u space.

01:10:22.950 --> 01:10:25.170
There's the one I'm
erasing, and there's

01:10:25.170 --> 01:10:28.410
this-- take this tree structure
with the very simple pointers.

01:10:28.410 --> 01:10:29.867
Add indirection.

01:10:29.867 --> 01:10:31.950
So admittedly, it's more
complicated to implement.

01:10:31.950 --> 01:10:33.526
But conceptually,
it's super simple.

01:10:33.526 --> 01:10:35.400
It's like, do this
obvious tree binary search

01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:36.930
on the level thing.

01:10:36.930 --> 01:10:40.080
And then add indirection,
and it fixes all your bounds,

01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:41.670
magically.

01:10:41.670 --> 01:10:43.600
So conceptually, very simple--

01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:47.850
practically, you definitely
want to do this-- much simpler.

01:10:47.850 --> 01:10:51.225
Now, what about saving space?

01:10:54.420 --> 01:10:56.820
Very simple idea--
which, I think,

01:10:56.820 --> 01:11:01.560
again, comes from Michael
Bender and Martin Farach-Colton.

01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:05.490
Don't store empty structures.

01:11:05.490 --> 01:11:09.620
So in this picture, we had
an array of all the clusters.

01:11:09.620 --> 01:11:13.200
But a cluster could be
entirely empty, like this one--

01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:15.470
this entirely empty cluster.

01:11:15.470 --> 01:11:16.440
Don't store it.

01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:18.110
It's a waste.

01:11:18.110 --> 01:11:20.710
If you store them all, you're
going to spend order u space.

01:11:20.710 --> 01:11:22.130
If you don't store them all--

01:11:22.130 --> 01:11:23.780
just don't store
the empty ones--

01:11:23.780 --> 01:11:25.210
I claim your order n space.

01:11:25.210 --> 01:11:27.910
Done.

01:11:27.910 --> 01:11:30.350
So I'm going back to
the structure I erased.

01:11:30.350 --> 01:11:33.110
Ignore the tree
perspective for awhile.

01:11:33.110 --> 01:11:39.440
Don't store empty clusters.

01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:41.960
OK, now, this sounds easy.

01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:44.090
But in reality, it's a
little bit more annoying.

01:11:44.090 --> 01:11:47.640
Because we wanted to have
an array of clusters.

01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:51.260
So we could quickly
find the cluster.

01:11:51.260 --> 01:11:52.810
If you store an
array, you're going

01:11:52.810 --> 01:11:54.650
to spend at least
square rot of u space.

01:11:54.650 --> 01:11:56.720
Because at the very
beginning, you say,

01:11:56.720 --> 01:11:58.040
here are my root u clusters.

01:11:58.040 --> 01:11:59.748
Now, some of them
might be null pointers.

01:11:59.748 --> 01:12:03.980
But I can't afford to store
that entire array of clusters.

01:12:03.980 --> 01:12:05.410
So don't use an array.

01:12:05.410 --> 01:12:06.980
Use a perfect hash table.

01:12:10.730 --> 01:12:13.990
So v dot cluster, instead
of being an array,

01:12:13.990 --> 01:12:18.650
is now, let's say, a
dynamic perfect hashing.

01:12:18.650 --> 01:12:21.250
And I'm going to use the
version which I did not present.

01:12:21.250 --> 01:12:23.750
The version I presented,
which used universal hashing,

01:12:23.750 --> 01:12:26.270
was order 1 expected.

01:12:26.270 --> 01:12:30.410
But I said that it can be
constant with high probability

01:12:30.410 --> 01:12:31.040
per operation.

01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:34.070
It's a little bit stronger.

01:12:34.070 --> 01:12:35.540
So now, everything's fine.

01:12:35.540 --> 01:12:37.880
If I do an index
v dot cluster c,

01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:41.120
that's still constant time,
with high probability now.

01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:45.940
And I claim this structure
is now order n's space.

01:12:45.940 --> 01:12:47.540
Why is it order n's space?

01:12:47.540 --> 01:12:56.510
By simple amortization--
charge each table entry in that

01:12:56.510 --> 01:13:01.250
hash table to the
min of the cluster.

01:13:06.924 --> 01:13:08.340
We're only storing
non-empty ones.

01:13:08.340 --> 01:13:11.840
So if one of these guys
exists in the hash table,

01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:13.670
we had to store a
pointer to it, then

01:13:13.670 --> 01:13:16.100
that means the summary
structure is non-zero.

01:13:16.100 --> 01:13:17.990
It means this guy is not empty.

01:13:17.990 --> 01:13:19.810
So it has an item in its min.

01:13:19.810 --> 01:13:22.820
Charge the space up here to
store the pointer to that min

01:13:22.820 --> 01:13:23.810
guy.

01:13:23.810 --> 01:13:27.200
Then each item-- each min item--

01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:28.880
only gets charged once.

01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:32.380
Because it only has one parent
that has a pointer to it.

01:13:32.380 --> 01:13:33.980
So you only charge once.

01:13:33.980 --> 01:13:38.290
And therefore-- charge
and table entry--

01:13:43.010 --> 01:13:45.050
only charge each element once.

01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:50.910
And that's all your space.

01:13:50.910 --> 01:13:53.310
So it's order n space.

01:13:53.310 --> 01:13:56.250
Done.

01:13:56.250 --> 01:13:57.050
Kind of crazy.

01:13:57.050 --> 01:14:00.180
I guess, if you want, there's
also the pointer to the summary

01:14:00.180 --> 01:14:00.680
structure.

01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:02.290
You could charge
that to your own min.

01:14:02.290 --> 01:14:03.581
And then you're charging twice.

01:14:03.581 --> 01:14:07.290
But it's constant per item.

01:14:07.290 --> 01:14:08.517
So this is kind of funny.

01:14:08.517 --> 01:14:10.850
Again, it doesn't appear in
print anywhere, except maybe

01:14:10.850 --> 01:14:12.920
as an exercise in CLRS now.

01:14:12.920 --> 01:14:16.760
But you get linear
order n space,

01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:18.890
just by adding hashing
in the obvious way.

01:14:18.890 --> 01:14:23.180
Now, for whatever reason,
Willard didn't see this,

01:14:23.180 --> 01:14:25.160
or wanted to do his
own thing, and so he

01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:30.409
found another way to do
order n space log log u query

01:14:30.409 --> 01:14:30.950
with hashing.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:35.570
Well, I guess, also,
you had to think

01:14:35.570 --> 01:14:36.780
of it in this simple form.

01:14:36.780 --> 01:14:38.510
It's harder to do
this in the tree.

01:14:38.510 --> 01:14:39.800
It can be done, I think.

01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:42.530
But this is a simpler view
than the tree, I think.

01:14:42.530 --> 01:14:45.320
And then boom-- order n space.

01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:48.140
But it turns out there's
another way to do it.

01:14:48.140 --> 01:14:49.820
This is a completely
different way

01:14:49.820 --> 01:14:52.940
to do Van Emde Boas-- actually,
not that completely different.

01:14:52.940 --> 01:14:58.613
It's another way to
do this with hashing.

01:15:02.690 --> 01:15:06.140
And we're going to start with
what's called x-fast trees,

01:15:06.140 --> 01:15:08.510
and then we will modify
it to get y-fast trees.

01:15:08.510 --> 01:15:11.882
That's Willard's terminology.

01:15:11.882 --> 01:15:15.560
OK, so x-fast trees
is, store this tree,

01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:18.060
but don't store the zeros.

01:15:18.060 --> 01:15:21.590
So don't store zeros.

01:15:21.590 --> 01:15:27.530
Only store the ones in the-- we
call this the simple tree view.

01:15:27.530 --> 01:15:29.030
This is why I, in
particular, wanted

01:15:29.030 --> 01:15:30.655
to tell you about
the simple tree view,

01:15:30.655 --> 01:15:33.320
because it is really
what x fast trees do.

01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:35.330
So what do I mean by
only store the ones?

01:15:35.330 --> 01:15:41.280
Well, each of these
ones has sort of a name.

01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:42.590
What is the name of this item?

01:15:42.590 --> 01:15:43.580
Its name is one--

01:15:43.580 --> 01:15:46.227
or in other words, 0, 0, 0, 1.

01:15:46.227 --> 01:15:47.810
Each of these nodes,
you can think of,

01:15:47.810 --> 01:15:49.580
what is the path to get here?

01:15:49.580 --> 01:15:52.730
Like, the path to get
to this one is 1, 0, 0.

01:15:52.730 --> 01:15:53.450
1 means right.

01:15:53.450 --> 01:15:54.800
0 means left.

01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:56.960
Those names give you
the binary indicator

01:15:56.960 --> 01:16:00.860
of where that node is in
the tree, in some sense.

01:16:00.860 --> 01:16:13.316
So store the ones as binary
strings in a hash table--

01:16:17.260 --> 01:16:19.270
again, a dynamic
perfect hash table.

01:16:19.270 --> 01:16:22.150
Let's say I can get constant
with high probability.

01:16:22.150 --> 01:16:23.860
OK.

01:16:23.860 --> 01:16:26.280
And if you're a
little concerned--

01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:29.290
so what this means--
the ones are exactly

01:16:29.290 --> 01:16:32.050
the prefixes of the paths
to each of the items.

01:16:32.050 --> 01:16:33.280
This was item one.

01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:37.420
And so I want to store this
one, which is empty string,

01:16:37.420 --> 01:16:40.120
this one, which is 0, this
one, which is 00, this one,

01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:44.060
which is 000, this
one, which is 0001.

01:16:44.060 --> 01:16:49.600
So I take 0001, which is
the item I want to store.

01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:51.970
And there's all
these prefixes, which

01:16:51.970 --> 01:16:54.310
are the items I want to store.

01:16:54.310 --> 01:16:56.290
And for this really
to make sense,

01:16:56.290 --> 01:16:58.180
you also need the
length of the string.

01:16:58.180 --> 01:17:01.810
Strings of different lengths
should be in different worlds.

01:17:01.810 --> 01:17:03.790
So the way, actually,
x-fast trees originally

01:17:03.790 --> 01:17:05.500
did it in the paper is,
have a different hash

01:17:05.500 --> 01:17:07.124
table for strings of
different lengths.

01:17:07.124 --> 01:17:09.310
So that's probably an easier
way to think about it.

01:17:09.310 --> 01:17:11.770
You store all the items
themselves in a hash table.

01:17:11.770 --> 01:17:13.330
You store all the
prefixes of all

01:17:13.330 --> 01:17:16.240
but the last bit in a
separate hash table,

01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:20.120
all but the last two bits in a
separate hash table, and so on.

01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:22.560
Now, what does this let you do?

01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:24.220
It lets you do this--

01:17:24.220 --> 01:17:28.162
binary search for the
0 to 1 transition.

01:17:30.760 --> 01:17:32.440
What we did here was--

01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:35.470
I look at the bit, is it 0 or 1?

01:17:35.470 --> 01:17:38.200
Instead of doing that, you do
a query into the hash table,

01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:39.760
and say, is it in
the hash table?

01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:42.900
It's in the hash table
if and only if it is one.

01:17:42.900 --> 01:17:44.980
So looking at a bit in
this conceptual tree

01:17:44.980 --> 01:17:47.350
is the same thing as
checking for containment

01:17:47.350 --> 01:17:48.760
in this hash table.

01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:52.630
But now, we don't have to
store the zeros, which is cool.

01:17:55.930 --> 01:18:04.600
We can now do search,
predecessor or successor, fast,

01:18:04.600 --> 01:18:11.650
in log w time, via
this old thing.

01:18:11.650 --> 01:18:15.080
Again, you have to have min
and max pointers, as well.

01:18:15.080 --> 01:18:17.039
So in this hash table,
you store the min

01:18:17.039 --> 01:18:18.205
and the max of your subtree.

01:18:21.030 --> 01:18:22.960
Or actually, from
a 1, you actually

01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:25.270
need the max of
the left subtree,

01:18:25.270 --> 01:18:27.170
and you need the min
of the right subtree.

01:18:27.170 --> 01:18:30.190
But it's a constant amount
of information per thing.

01:18:30.190 --> 01:18:36.190
This is not perfect, however,
in that it uses nw space.

01:18:38.920 --> 01:18:40.840
And also, updates are slow.

01:18:40.840 --> 01:18:42.775
It's order w updates.

01:19:01.540 --> 01:19:02.650
But we're almost there.

01:19:02.650 --> 01:19:06.520
Because we have fast
queries, slow updates, not

01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:07.990
optimal space.

01:19:07.990 --> 01:19:09.340
Take this.

01:19:09.340 --> 01:19:11.955
Add indirection-- done.

01:19:11.955 --> 01:19:12.955
And that's y-fast trees.

01:19:17.950 --> 01:19:20.660
y-fast trees-- you
take x-fast trees,

01:19:20.660 --> 01:19:25.470
you add this
indirection right here,

01:19:25.470 --> 01:19:33.266
and you get log w per
operation order and space.

01:19:33.266 --> 01:19:34.950
Of course, this is
a high probability

01:19:34.950 --> 01:19:37.740
because we're using hashing.

01:19:37.740 --> 01:19:40.290
Because we have a
factor w bad here,

01:19:40.290 --> 01:19:41.400
we have factor w bad here.

01:19:41.400 --> 01:19:42.390
You divide by w.

01:19:42.390 --> 01:19:43.770
You're done.

01:19:43.770 --> 01:19:48.360
Up here, you have n over w
space. n over w times w is n.

01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:51.360
Queries, just like
before, remain log w.

01:19:51.360 --> 01:19:53.040
But now-- boom--

01:19:53.040 --> 01:19:56.160
updates, we pay log w
because of the binary search

01:19:56.160 --> 01:19:59.035
trees at the bottom,
but pretty cool.

01:19:59.035 --> 01:20:00.840
Isn't that neat?

01:20:00.840 --> 01:20:02.190
I've never seen this before.

01:20:02.190 --> 01:20:04.690
OK, I've seen x-fast
trees and y-fast trees.

01:20:04.690 --> 01:20:06.690
But it's really just the same--

01:20:06.690 --> 01:20:09.990
we're taking Van Emde Boas,
looking at it in the tree view.

01:20:09.990 --> 01:20:11.699
You can see where
Willard got this stuff.

01:20:11.699 --> 01:20:14.073
It's like, oh, man I really
want to store all these bits,

01:20:14.073 --> 01:20:15.300
but hey, it's way too big.

01:20:15.300 --> 01:20:17.280
Just don't store the zeros.

01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:19.260
That means we should
use a hash table.

01:20:19.260 --> 01:20:22.770
Ah , hash table just gives you
whether the bit is in or out.

01:20:22.770 --> 01:20:24.480
Great.

01:20:24.480 --> 01:20:25.749
Now use indirection.

01:20:25.749 --> 01:20:27.540
And indirection was
already floating around

01:20:27.540 --> 01:20:29.220
as a concept at the time--

01:20:29.220 --> 01:20:30.560
slightly different parameters.

01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:32.970
Van Emde Boas had
his own indirection

01:20:32.970 --> 01:20:38.187
to reduce the space
from u times log w to u.

01:20:38.187 --> 01:20:40.020
But Willard did it,
and-- boom-- it got down

01:20:40.020 --> 01:20:43.140
to n space in this way.

01:20:43.140 --> 01:20:45.700
But as you saw, you can also do
it directly to Van Emde Boas.

01:20:45.700 --> 01:20:47.304
All these ideas can
be interchanged.

01:20:47.304 --> 01:20:48.720
You can combine
any data structure

01:20:48.720 --> 01:20:50.220
you want with any
space saving trick

01:20:50.220 --> 01:20:51.810
you want, with
indirection, if you

01:20:51.810 --> 01:20:55.290
need to, to speed things up
and reduce space a little bit.

01:20:55.290 --> 01:20:57.190
So there's many,
many ways to do this.

01:20:57.190 --> 01:20:59.230
But in the end, you get
log w per operation,

01:20:59.230 --> 01:21:00.750
and order n space.

01:21:00.750 --> 01:21:02.070
And that sort of result one.

01:21:02.070 --> 01:21:04.530
And it's probably the most
useful predecessor data

01:21:04.530 --> 01:21:05.487
structure, in general.

01:21:05.487 --> 01:21:07.320
But next time, we'll
see fusion trees, which

01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:10.730
are good for when w is huge.
