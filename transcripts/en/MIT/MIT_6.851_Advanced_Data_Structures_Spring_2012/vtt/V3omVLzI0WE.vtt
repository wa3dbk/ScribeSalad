00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:21.930
ERIK DEMAINE: All right.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.530
Today we start a new section
in advanced data structures,

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.480
and it's data structures
for memory hierarchy.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.820
So the idea here is while
almost all data structures think

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.000
about memory as a flat thing.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.180
And in the RAM model,
you've got a giant array.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.970
You can access the i-th
element in your giant array

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:43.730
in constant time.

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.430
The memory hierarchy,
you admit the reality

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.080
of almost all computers
since, I don't know, '80s,

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.760
which have caches.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:01.410
The idea is you have
your CPU connected

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.769
with a very high bandwidth
channel to a relatively

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.730
small cache, which is
connected via a relatively

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:14.610
narrow bandwidth channel
to a really big memory.

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.680
And in real computers,
this keeps going.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.050
You've got level 1 cache,
then level 2 cache,

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.740
then level 3 cache maybe, then
main memory, then disk, then

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.480
network, whatever.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.460
Usually the disk has a cache.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.420
So you have this
very deep hierarchy,

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.830
which is typically growing
exponentially in size,

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.850
and also growing exponentially
in slowness, in latency.

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.640
So you'd like to
design data structures

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.180
that most of the time are
working at the cache level,

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.100
because that's really fast.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.720
And as little as
possible, you'd like

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.250
to go to the deeper levels.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.350
So we're going to define
two models for working

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.925
with memory hierarchies.

00:01:56.925 --> 00:02:00.270
The first model is called
the external memory model.

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.940
It's also called the I/O model.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.110
It's also called the
Disk Access Model,

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.760
I think just so that it could
be called the DAM model.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.130
I usually call it the
external memory model.

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.650
And this is sort of
the simplest model.

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.154
It's also the most well
studied, I would say.

00:02:26.154 --> 00:02:28.320
And it's going to relate
closely to the other models

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.614
that we're going to look at.

00:02:29.614 --> 00:02:31.405
And the idea with the
external memory model

00:02:31.405 --> 00:02:34.380
is, yeah, OK, a
real computer has

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.320
many levels in this hierarchy.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.500
But let's just focus on the last
one and the next to last one,

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.230
because typically that last
one is going to be way,

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.789
way slower than all the others.

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:47.580
And so you really want
to minimize how many

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.560
memory transfers happen here.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:58.410
So I want to count the number
of memory transfers between two

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:59.550
levels.

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.010
And so this model just
thinks about two levels.

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.730
I'll call them cache and disk.

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.240
We think of disk as
infinite and slow.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.500
We think of cache as not only
fast, but infinitely fast.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.950
It takes zero time to
access something in cache.

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.200
All we're thinking
about is how many

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.350
transfers between the left
and right have to happen.

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.870
So computation here is free.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.730
Access over here is free.

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.440
And we just pay for this.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.820
That's the external
memory model.

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.361
You can also think about running
time, make sure running time

00:03:32.361 --> 00:03:34.950
is still optimal and that will
guarantee this part's good.

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.250
But usually the hard part
is to minimize this part,

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.530
minimize number of
memory transfers.

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.380
Now, to make this problem
really interesting,

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.340
we need to add one
more assumption.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.190
And this is also the
case in practice,

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.900
that when you request--

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.760
when you transfer an
item from disk to cache,

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.010
you get not just that
item, but entire block

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.830
of items at the same speed.

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:03.960
So in fact, disk
we're going to think

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:07.830
of as divided into blocks.

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:15.810
Block size here is B, capital B.

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.430
Also over here, caches are
divided into blocks of size B.

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.930
And we have a limited
number of them.

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:30.900
We're going to suppose we
have M over B cache lines

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.000
they're usually called
at the cache level.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.510
And so the total
size of the cache

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.900
is M. M stands for memory.

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:39.120
Sorry.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.700
This notation is
slightly confusing

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.130
for historical reasons,
but that's the way it is.

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:45.210
So B is block size.

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.920
M is cache size,
total cache size.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.670
There's M over B
blocks of size B. Disk

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.769
has infinitely many
blocks of size B.

00:04:53.769 --> 00:04:55.310
There's lots of
motivations for this.

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.850
But basically, the main cost
you're paying here is latency.

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.400
You have to send
a request and then

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.720
the answer has to come back.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.170
Think of that as the disk
is far away from the CPU.

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:09.815
And so it takes a long time
for the request to get there

00:05:09.815 --> 00:05:11.110
and for the data to get back.

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:12.300
So if you're sending
data back, you

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.850
might as well send-- it's just
as fast to send a lot of data

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:16.450
as a little bit of data.

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:18.680
In fact, typically you
set this block size

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:22.550
that the amount of time it
takes for data to arrive

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:26.270
equals the latency to
balance those two costs.

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:27.740
With disk it's
especially the case,

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:30.020
because you have this latency
of moving the disk head.

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:31.936
Once you move the disk
head, you might as well

00:05:31.936 --> 00:05:34.310
read the entire track,
the entire circle of that

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:35.780
if you're dealing
with hard drives.

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.210
It's just as fast once
the head gets there.

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:42.710
OK.

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:44.000
So that's the model.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
And so now we want to minimize
the number of block memory

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.757
transfers this happens.

00:05:48.757 --> 00:05:50.840
And the blocks make things
a lot more interesting,

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:52.610
because that means
when you read an item,

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:55.310
you really want to use all
the items right around it

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:57.391
soon, before it gets
kicked out of cache.

00:05:57.391 --> 00:05:58.765
Obviously, cache
is limited size,

00:05:58.765 --> 00:06:00.223
so when you bring
something, you've

00:06:00.223 --> 00:06:01.430
got to kick something out.

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:03.770
That's the block
replacement strategy.

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.510
In the external memory model,
you can do whatever you want.

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:10.970
You have full control
over this cache.

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:13.460
So let's see.

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.880
Let me write some
obvious bounds.

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:22.900
And then I'll tell you some of
the main results in this model.

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:25.520
So number of memory transfers
is what we care about.

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:37.070
And it's going to be at most
the running time on a RAM,

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:40.610
so this is a comparison
between two models.

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:44.810
At most, every operation you
do on a RAM data structure

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:46.220
incurs one memory transfer.

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:47.840
That would be the worst case.

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.820
So that's what we want to beat.

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:52.400
There's also a lower bound.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:07:03.110
So this is also at least the
number of cell probes divided

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:06.170
by B. I think we've talked
briefly about the cell probe

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:09.360
model, I think in
retroactive data structures.

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:13.210
Cell probe model is this
model where all you count is--

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:14.930
you just count how
many words did I

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:18.710
have to read in order to do
this data structure operation?

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:20.390
So computation is free.

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:24.620
We just count number of
word reads from memory.

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:28.140
So it's a lower bound
on RAM data structures.

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:32.480
And in this model, we're only
counting memory accesses,

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:35.480
but where cell probes
you count word numbers,

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:37.300
here we're counting blocks.

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:41.180
And so at best, we can
improve by a factor of B.

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:42.860
So this is a lower bound.

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:45.170
This is an upper bound,
so there's roughly a slop

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:46.730
of a factor of B here.

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:50.030
We want to do closer to
this bound than this bound.

00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:51.460
This is the obvious thing.

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:54.120
Want to get down to
here whenever we can.

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:59.980
So let me give you
some examples of that,

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:04.340
so sort of a bunch of basic
results in this model.

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:22.670
Result 0 is scanning, so
if I have an array of items

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:27.290
and I just want to,
say, add them all up

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:30.740
or do a linear scan to search
for something, anything that

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:33.440
involves accessing
them in order,

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:42.179
this will cost I guess
ceiling of N over B.

00:08:42.179 --> 00:08:46.880
If the array has size N,
number of blocks in that array

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:53.310
is ceiling of N over B. And so
that's how many block accesses

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:53.810
it costs.

00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:59.110
So the annoying part
here is the ceiling.

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:02.520
If N is smaller than B,
then this is not great.

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:06.110
I mean, you have to pay one
memory read, so it's optimal.

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:08.540
But anyway, that's scanning.

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:09.861
Pretty boring.

00:09:09.861 --> 00:09:12.110
Slightly more interesting,
although not that much more

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:13.610
interesting, is search trees.

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.920
If you want to be able
to search for an item

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:24.054
in this external memory model--

00:09:24.054 --> 00:09:25.970
in this external memory
model, what do you do?

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:41.240
B-trees, conveniently
named B-trees.

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:47.060
We want the branching
factor of a B-tree

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:50.860
to be B. Anything
that's theta B will do,

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:52.530
but exactly B is great.

00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:54.320
If you can read all
of these pointers

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:58.400
and read all of these key
values, if that fits in B,

00:09:58.400 --> 00:09:59.330
then we're happy.

00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:06.990
So yeah, typically we assume
the branching factor here

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:08.210
is like B plus 1.

00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:13.970
So in particular,
if B is 1, you still

00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:15.630
have a branching
factor of 2, just

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:18.680
to make it a reasonable tree.

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:20.750
And so now in a
constant number of block

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:24.020
reads you can read all the
data you need to decide

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:25.850
which child pointer you follow.

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:28.340
You follow that child
pointer, and so it

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:36.620
takes log base B plus
1 of N to do a search.

00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:43.700
This is counting
memory transfers.

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:45.350
So this is not as
big an improvement.

00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:47.870
Here, we've improved by
a factor of B roughly.

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:52.640
Here we're improving by a
factor of basically log B.

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:56.630
So not as good as you might
hope to do, dividing by B,

00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:58.370
but it turns out
this is optimal.

00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:04.730
You need log base
B plus 1 of N to do

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:12.270
a search in comparison model.

00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:24.740
In the same way, you
need log base 2 of N time

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:26.830
to do a search in
the comparison model,

00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:29.019
in this model you
need log base B of N.

00:11:29.019 --> 00:11:31.060
Let me talk a little bit
about the proof of that.

00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:38.810
It's a pretty simple
information theoretic argument.

00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:46.300
So we prove this lower bound.

00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:47.450
The idea is the following.

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:51.220
You want to figure
out among N items

00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:55.780
here where your item fits.

00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:58.040
Let's say it fits right here.

00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:02.380
So you want to know it's between
this element and this element.

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:04.450
How many bits of
information is that?

00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:08.380
Well, there's I guess N plus
1 different outcomes of where

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:10.540
your item could fit.

00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:13.280
If you allow it to exactly
match, it's maybe twice that.

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:20.770
But there's theta N
options for your answer.

00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:28.806
And so if you take logs, that
is log N bits of information.

00:12:32.356 --> 00:12:33.730
And this is how
you normally show

00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:35.337
that you need log N comparison.

00:12:35.337 --> 00:12:37.420
You need log N comparisons
because each comparison

00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:41.230
could at most give you one
bit of information, yes or no.

00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:43.750
And there's log N bits to
get, so that's the lower bound

00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:45.310
in binary search.

00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:47.260
But now we're in this
model where we're not

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:48.910
counting comparisons,
even though we're

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:50.140
in the comparison model.

00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:52.570
We're counting number
of block transfers.

00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:59.560
So when I read in some data,
I get B items from my array,

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:02.050
or from something.

00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:10.440
So when I do a block read, all
I can do in the comparison model

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:14.710
is compare my item to
everything that I read,

00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:16.810
so you might as well
compare all of them.

00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:29.080
But the information you learn
is only log B plus 1 bits,

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:33.010
because what you learn is among
these B items, where do I fit?

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:39.870
And in the best case,
that is log of B

00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:42.530
plus 1 bits of information.

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:46.160
It could be worse, if these
guys are not well distributed

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:47.780
among your N items.

00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:48.530
It's at most that.

00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:56.750
And so you take the ratio
and you need log N over log B

00:13:56.750 --> 00:14:00.590
plus 1 block reads.

00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:08.115
And that's log
base B plus 1 of N.

00:14:08.115 --> 00:14:08.990
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:09.320
ERIK DEMAINE: Yeah.

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:10.263
Question?

00:14:10.263 --> 00:14:13.530
AUDIENCE: Why is that you
learn log B plus 1 bits when

00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:14.410
you [INAUDIBLE]?

00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:15.410
ERIK DEMAINE: All right.

00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:17.180
So the claim is, in
the comparison model,

00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:21.500
you compare your item
to everyone in here.

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:26.840
But if your array is presorted,
then all you're learning is--

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:28.730
I mean, information
theoretically,

00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:33.420
all your learning is where your
item fits among these B items.

00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:39.680
So there's order B options of
where you fit, and so only log

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:44.570
B bits of information there.

00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:47.750
You might consider
this a vague argument.

00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:49.460
You can do a more
formal version of it.

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:55.380
But I like the information
theoretic perspective.

00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:55.890
Cool.

00:14:55.890 --> 00:15:01.170
So that's the best thing you
can do for search in this model.

00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:03.720
Now, you might also wonder
about insertions and deletions.

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:05.910
B-trees support insertions
and deletions in log

00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:09.730
base B plus 1 of N time,
but that is not optimal.

00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:12.180
We can do better.

00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:22.976
So for example, if
you want to sort,

00:15:22.976 --> 00:15:26.985
the right answer for
sorting is this crazy bound.

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:35.970
N over B, which is
really good, that's

00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:40.920
linear time in this model, times
log base M over B of N over B.

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:44.492
This is a slight-- this is
roughly log base M of N.

00:15:44.492 --> 00:15:48.730
The over B's don't make
too big a difference.

00:15:48.730 --> 00:15:50.910
So this is an improvement.

00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:53.870
Normally sorting takes
N log N with a base 2.

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:57.540
We're improving the base of the
log to M over B instead of 2.

00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:01.770
And we're improving the overall
running time by a factor of B.

00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:04.930
So this is actually a
really big improvement.

00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:10.050
We're going faster than the
RAM time divided by a B,

00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:12.102
because to sort in
the cell probe model

00:16:12.102 --> 00:16:13.060
just takes linear time.

00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:14.010
You read all the data.

00:16:14.010 --> 00:16:14.580
You sort it.

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:16.980
You put it back.

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:22.050
So we can't quite get N over
B, but we get this log factor.

00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:23.250
So this is really good.

00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:27.210
And it's something that would
not result from using B-trees.

00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:30.590
This is a little funny,
because in regular RAM model,

00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:35.059
if you insert everything into
a balanced binary search tree,

00:16:35.059 --> 00:16:36.600
then do an in order
traversal, that's

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:38.820
an optimal sorting algorithm.

00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:40.320
It gives you N log N.

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:42.192
Here, it's not optimal.

00:16:42.192 --> 00:16:43.650
You throw everything
into a B-tree,

00:16:43.650 --> 00:16:46.971
you get N times log
base B of N. So there's

00:16:46.971 --> 00:16:47.970
two things that are bad.

00:16:47.970 --> 00:16:50.840
One is that the base of
the log is slightly off.

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:54.810
It's B versus M over B.
That's not so big a deal.

00:16:54.810 --> 00:16:59.400
The big thing is it's
N over B versus N.

00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:04.959
We don't want to pay N. We want
to pay N over B. There's also

00:17:04.959 --> 00:17:07.500
a matching lower bound in the
comparison model, which we will

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:08.760
not cover here.

00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:17.280
By next lecture, we'll know
how to do sorting optimally.

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:19.260
First, I want to tell
you about a bunch

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:24.975
of different ways or different
problems and results.

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:33.930
So a funny problem,
which actually does

00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:37.350
arise in practice, but
it's interesting just

00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:40.350
to think about,
instead of sorting--

00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:41.880
sorting is I give you an array.

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:43.290
I don't know what order it's in.

00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:44.998
You have to find the
right order and then

00:17:44.998 --> 00:17:46.380
put it into the right order.

00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:49.110
There's an easier problem,
which is called permuting.

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:50.070
I give you an array.

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:52.890
I give you a permutation
that I'd like to do.

00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:55.980
I just want you to
move the items around.

00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:59.872
So you don't need to do any
comparisons to get here.

00:17:59.872 --> 00:18:01.080
I tell you what the order is.

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:03.420
You just have to
physically move the items.

00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:06.690
This is harder than it
sounds, because when you read,

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:09.510
you read blocks of items
in the original order.

00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:12.720
And so it's hard to just do
an arbitrary permutation.

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:14.190
And there's two
obvious algorithms.

00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:17.575
One is you could
sort your items.

00:18:17.575 --> 00:18:19.440
So you could go to
every item in order

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:25.140
and just write down its desired
number in the new permutation,

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:26.880
write down the permutation.

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:28.110
Then run a sorting algorithm.

00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:31.890
That will take N over B log
base M over B of N over B.

00:18:31.890 --> 00:18:36.452
Or the other obvious algorithm
is to take the first item,

00:18:36.452 --> 00:18:38.910
put it where it belongs in the
array, take the second item,

00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:41.260
put it where it
belongs in the array,

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:42.740
in a new copy of the array.

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:46.020
And that will take at
most N memory transfers,

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:48.534
each one a completely
separate memory transfer.

00:18:48.534 --> 00:18:49.950
And the claim is
the optimal thing

00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:52.150
to do is the min of those two.

00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:54.780
So you just check
how does N and B

00:18:54.780 --> 00:19:00.460
and M compare, do the better
of the two algorithms.

00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:02.940
Again, there's a lower bound.

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:05.340
In a model called the
indivisible model,

00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:10.710
which is assuming that
each word of your data

00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:13.000
doesn't get cut into subwords.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.580
So this is assuming--

00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:20.370
the lower bound assuming
your words do not get cut up.

00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:26.930
I believe it's still unsolved
whether you could do better

00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:28.332
otherwise.

00:19:28.332 --> 00:19:32.790
The last result in this
model I wanted to talk about

00:19:32.790 --> 00:19:34.470
is called buffer trees.

00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:36.660
Buffer trees are pretty cool.

00:19:39.619 --> 00:19:41.160
They're essentially
a dynamic version

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:44.640
of sorting, which
is what we lack--

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:46.360
what B-trees do not give you.

00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:11.680
So they achieve
the sorting bound

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:16.759
divided by N per operation,
so this is optimal.

00:20:16.759 --> 00:20:18.550
I haven't told you what
the operations are.

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:19.550
The amount is amortized.

00:20:19.550 --> 00:20:22.720
It has to be amortized,
because this bound is typically

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:24.610
little o of 1.

00:20:24.610 --> 00:20:26.920
Think of this as 1 over
B. There's a log factor.

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:30.550
But assuming that log factor is
smaller than B, which is often

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:32.690
the case, this is
in order 1 over B.

00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:35.560
It's a little o of 1 cost,
which is a little fun.

00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:37.675
But of course, every
real cost is an integer.

00:20:37.675 --> 00:20:40.540
It's an integer number
of block transfers.

00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:45.510
But amortized, you can
get a little o of 1 bound.

00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:51.185
And what it lets you do is
delayed queries and batch

00:20:51.185 --> 00:20:51.685
updates.

00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:06.030
So I can do an insert
and I can a delete.

00:21:06.030 --> 00:21:07.720
I can do many of them.

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:09.870
And then I can do a query
against the current data

00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:11.160
structure.

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:14.107
I want to know, I don't know,
the successor of an item.

00:21:14.107 --> 00:21:15.690
But I don't get the
answer right then.

00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:17.880
It's delayed.

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:18.930
The query will sit there.

00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:20.346
Eventually the
data structure will

00:21:20.346 --> 00:21:22.590
decide to give me an answer.

00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:24.960
Or it may just never
give me an answer.

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:27.612
But then there's a new operation
at the end, which is flush,

00:21:27.612 --> 00:21:29.820
which is give me all the
answers to all the questions

00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:31.080
that I asked.

00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:33.820
And the flush takes
this much time.

00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:36.720
So if you do N operations
and then say flush,

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:39.240
then it doesn't
take any extra time.

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:40.944
It's going to cost
one sort of pass

00:21:40.944 --> 00:21:43.110
through the entire data
structure, one sorting step.

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:46.790
Yeah.

00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:53.670
The one thing you can get for
free is a zero-cost find min.

00:21:58.300 --> 00:21:59.020
All right.

00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:02.074
So buffer tree, you can do
find min instantaneously.

00:22:02.074 --> 00:22:03.490
It maintains the
min all the time.

00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:05.470
So this lets you do
a priority queue.

00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:09.430
You can do insert and delete
min in this much time online.

00:22:13.886 --> 00:22:15.760
But if you want to do
other kinds of queries,

00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:19.000
then they're slow to answer.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.046
You get the answer much later.

00:22:21.046 --> 00:22:22.713
So this is a dynamic
version of sorting.

00:22:22.713 --> 00:22:24.254
It lets you do
sorting in particular.

00:22:24.254 --> 00:22:26.530
It let's you do priority
queues, other great things.

00:22:26.530 --> 00:22:28.860
We will see not
quite a buffer tree

00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:31.960
but another data structure
achieving similar bounds

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:34.695
in the next lecture.

00:22:34.695 --> 00:22:36.070
Today's lecture
is actually going

00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:38.980
to be about B-trees, which
seems kind of boring,

00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:40.810
because we already
know how to do B-trees.

00:22:40.810 --> 00:22:43.480
But we're going to do them
in another model, which

00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:47.020
is the cache-oblivious model.

00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:48.520
So let me tell you
about that model.

00:23:06.376 --> 00:23:07.090
All right.

00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:09.925
So the cache-oblivious
model is much newer.

00:23:09.925 --> 00:23:14.050
It's from 1999.

00:23:14.050 --> 00:23:18.910
And it's from MIT
originally, Charles Leiserson

00:23:18.910 --> 00:23:21.820
and his students
invented it back then,

00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:24.970
in the context of
6406, I believe.

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:29.650
And it's almost the same as
this external memory model.

00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:33.520
There's one change, which is
that the algorithm doesn't

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:35.020
know what B or M is.

00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:49.290
Now, this is both awkward
and cool at the same time.

00:23:49.290 --> 00:23:54.230
So the assumption is that
the computer looks like this.

00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:55.490
The algorithm has no--

00:23:55.490 --> 00:23:57.320
and the algorithm
knows that fact,

00:23:57.320 --> 00:24:01.340
but it doesn't know what the
parameters of the cache are.

00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:03.590
Doesn't know how the
memory is blocked.

00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:07.250
Now, as a consequence, it cannot
manually say, read this block,

00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:08.480
write this block.

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:11.090
It can't decide which
block to kick out.

00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:14.270
This is going to be more
like a typical algorithm.

00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:17.810
I mean, the algorithm will look
like a regular RAM algorithm.

00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:19.780
It's going to say
read this word,

00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:25.550
write this word to memory,
do an addition, whatever.

00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:34.580
So algorithm looks
like a RAM algorithm.

00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:36.719
But the analysis is
going to be different.

00:24:41.610 --> 00:24:44.964
So this is convenient,
because algorithms--

00:24:44.964 --> 00:24:46.880
I mean, how you implement
an algorithm becomes

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:48.200
much clearer in this model.

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:51.170
And this is-- now we're going
to assume that the cache is

00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:52.782
maintained automatically.

00:24:57.980 --> 00:25:02.150
In particular, the way
that blocks are replaced

00:25:02.150 --> 00:25:03.380
becomes automatic.

00:25:07.490 --> 00:25:10.010
So the assumption is when
you read a word from memory,

00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:11.330
the entire block comes over.

00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:13.880
You just don't know
how much data that is.

00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:15.500
And when something
gets kicked out,

00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:18.410
the entire block gets kicked
out and written to memory.

00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:20.120
But you don't get
to see how that's

00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:24.800
happening, because you don't
know anything about B or M.

00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:26.990
We need to assume something
about this replacement

00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:27.950
strategy.

00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:29.990
And in the
cache-oblivious model,

00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:32.225
we assume that it is optimal.

00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:38.570
This is an offline
notion, saying

00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:40.100
what block we're
going to kick out

00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:43.140
is the one that will be
used farthest in the future,

00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:45.500
so this is very hard to
implement in practice,

00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:47.170
because you need a crystal ball.

00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:50.900
But good news is, you
could use something

00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:54.820
like LRU, Least Recently Used,
kick that guy out, or even

00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:58.010
a very simple algorithm,
first in, first out.

00:25:58.010 --> 00:25:59.870
The most recent--
the oldest block

00:25:59.870 --> 00:26:02.960
that you brought in is
the one that you kick out.

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:05.810
These are actually
very close to optimal.

00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:16.160
They're constant
competitive against or given

00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:17.420
a cache of twice the size.

00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:25.910
So this is from the early
days of competitive analysis.

00:26:25.910 --> 00:26:29.460
It says if I compare offline
optimal with a cache size M

00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:30.660
versus--

00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:32.890
or let's say offline
optimal with a cache size

00:26:32.890 --> 00:26:35.940
M over 2, versus
LRU or FIFO, which

00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:38.700
are online algorithms
on a cache of size M,

00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:43.140
then this cost will be at
most I think twice this cost.

00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:45.320
Now, the good news is, you
look at all these bounds,

00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:48.870
you change M by a factor
of 2, nothing changes.

00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:51.600
Assuming everything is
at least some constant,

00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:54.570
and M and B are not
super super close,

00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:58.650
then changing M by a factor of
2 doesn't affect these bounds.

00:26:58.650 --> 00:27:02.550
These ones don't even have M in
them, so it's not a big deal.

00:27:02.550 --> 00:27:06.107
So we're going to assume
this basically for analysis.

00:27:06.107 --> 00:27:07.440
It's not really that big a deal.

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:09.365
You could also analyze
with these models.

00:27:09.365 --> 00:27:10.740
The point is
they're all the same

00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:17.040
within a constant factor for
the algorithms we care about.

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:18.225
What other fun things?

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:25.320
If you have a good,
cache-oblivious algorithm,

00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:28.800
it's good simultaneously
for all B and M.

00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:29.890
That's the consequence.

00:27:29.890 --> 00:27:32.970
So whereas B-trees for
example, need to know B,

00:27:32.970 --> 00:27:35.700
they need to have the right
branching factor for your value

00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:39.600
of B, the cache-oblivious
model, you have to have--

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:41.790
your data structure
has to be correct,

00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:46.140
has to be optimized for all
values of B and all values of M

00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:47.940
simultaneously.

00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:50.280
So this has some
nice side effects.

00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:53.820
In particular, you
essentially adapt

00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:59.460
to different values of B and
M. So two nice side effects

00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:03.090
of that are that if you have a
multi-level memory hierarchy,

00:28:03.090 --> 00:28:06.450
each level has its
own B and its own M.

00:28:06.450 --> 00:28:08.034
If you use a
cache-oblivious algorithm

00:28:08.034 --> 00:28:10.200
and all of those caches are
maintained automatically

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:12.840
using one of these
strategies, then

00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:16.080
you optimize the number of--
maybe I should draw a picture.

00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:22.770
Here's a multi-level
memory hierarchy.

00:28:22.770 --> 00:28:25.509
You optimize the number
of memory transfers

00:28:25.509 --> 00:28:26.550
between these two levels.

00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:28.200
You optimize the number
of memory transfers

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:30.390
between these two levels,
between these two levels,

00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:32.460
and between these two levels.

00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:34.530
So you optimize everything.

00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:35.790
Each of them has some--

00:28:35.790 --> 00:28:39.875
if you just think of this as
one big level versus this level

00:28:39.875 --> 00:28:43.350
or versus all the
levels to the right,

00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:47.190
then that has some B
and some M. And you're

00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:50.520
minimizing the number of
memory transfers here.

00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:54.930
Also, if B and M are changing,
lots of situations for that.

00:28:54.930 --> 00:28:57.780
If you have multiple programs
running at the same time,

00:28:57.780 --> 00:28:59.466
then your cache size
might effectively

00:28:59.466 --> 00:29:00.840
go down if they're
really running

00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:05.610
in parallel on the same
computer, or pseudo-parallel.

00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:06.950
Block size could change.

00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:09.480
If you think of a disk
and your block size

00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:12.242
is the size of your track,
then closer to the center,

00:29:12.242 --> 00:29:13.200
the tracks are smaller.

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:16.687
Closer to the rim of the
disk then blocks are bigger.

00:29:16.687 --> 00:29:19.020
All these things basically
in the cache-oblivious model,

00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:21.450
you don't care, because
it will just work.

00:29:21.450 --> 00:29:23.010
Now, there's no
nice formalization

00:29:23.010 --> 00:29:24.930
of adapting to changing
values of B and M.

00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:27.150
That's kind of an
open problem to make

00:29:27.150 --> 00:29:28.712
explicit what that means.

00:29:28.712 --> 00:29:31.170
But we're going to assume in
the cache-oblivious models you

00:29:31.170 --> 00:29:34.664
have one fixed B, one fixed
M, analyze relative to that.

00:29:34.664 --> 00:29:37.080
But of course, that analysis
applies simultaneously to all

00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:38.750
B's and all M's.

00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:43.990
And so it feels like you adapt
optimally, whatever that means.

00:29:47.064 --> 00:29:48.730
In some sense, the
most surprising thing

00:29:48.730 --> 00:29:52.600
about the cache-oblivious
world is that it's possible.

00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:56.200
You can work in this
model and get basically

00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:58.520
all of these results.

00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:02.080
So let me go over these results.

00:30:24.184 --> 00:30:26.850
So in the cache-oblivious model,
of course scans are still good.

00:30:26.850 --> 00:30:32.520
Scans didn't assume anything
about block size here,

00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:34.170
except in the analysis.

00:30:34.170 --> 00:30:36.450
Scanning was just
a sequential read.

00:30:36.450 --> 00:30:40.594
In general, we can do
constant number of scans.

00:30:40.594 --> 00:30:41.760
Some of them can go to left.

00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:43.200
Some of them could
go to the right.

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:44.070
Some of them could be reading.

00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:45.530
Some of them could be writing.

00:30:45.530 --> 00:30:47.070
That's the general form of scan.

00:30:47.070 --> 00:30:51.560
But all of that will take
order N over B ceiling.

00:30:59.670 --> 00:31:00.350
OK.

00:31:00.350 --> 00:31:00.850
Search.

00:31:05.010 --> 00:31:07.290
This is what we're going
to be focused on today.

00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:19.890
You can achieve order log
base B plus 1 of N search,

00:31:19.890 --> 00:31:20.820
insert, and delete.

00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:32.929
Just like B-trees, but
without knowing what B is.

00:31:32.929 --> 00:31:34.470
We're going to do
most of that today.

00:31:37.451 --> 00:31:37.950
What's next?

00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:38.937
Sorting.

00:31:38.937 --> 00:31:40.395
Sorting, you can
do the same bound.

00:31:43.050 --> 00:31:44.260
That we'll see next lecture.

00:31:55.430 --> 00:31:56.830
OK.

00:31:56.830 --> 00:31:59.170
Next is permuting.

00:32:07.690 --> 00:32:10.380
Here there's actually a
negative result, which

00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:14.080
is that you can't do the min.

00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:17.815
It doesn't say exactly
what you can do.

00:32:17.815 --> 00:32:19.440
In particular, we
can certainly permute

00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:21.030
as quickly as we can sort.

00:32:21.030 --> 00:32:23.100
And we can permute--

00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:25.260
we can achieve this
min in a weird sense,

00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:28.130
in that we can achieve N and
we can achieve the sorting

00:32:28.130 --> 00:32:30.720
bound for permutation in
the cache-oblivious model,

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:32.580
either one, but
not both with min

00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:35.430
around them, because to
know which one to apply,

00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:37.660
you need to know how
B and M relate to N,

00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:39.222
and you don't here.

00:32:39.222 --> 00:32:40.680
And so there's a
lower bound saying

00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:42.360
you really can't
achieve this bound,

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:44.640
even up to constant factors.

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:48.460
But it doesn't explicitly
say anything more than that.

00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:49.770
So a little awkward.

00:32:49.770 --> 00:32:52.650
Fortunately, permuting
isn't that big a deal.

00:32:52.650 --> 00:32:55.200
And most of the time
the sorting bound

00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:58.770
is much faster than the
end bound, so not so bad.

00:32:58.770 --> 00:33:00.810
But slightly awkward.

00:33:00.810 --> 00:33:02.310
So there's some
things you can't do.

00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:04.800
This was the first negative
result in cache-oblivious.

00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:08.460
Another fun negative result
is actually in search trees.

00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:12.690
You might ask, what is
this constant factor here

00:33:12.690 --> 00:33:15.570
in front of the log
base B plus 1 of N?

00:33:15.570 --> 00:33:20.010
And for B-trees, the constant
factor is essentially 1.

00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:28.360
You get 1 times log
base B plus 1 of N.

00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:29.910
In cache-oblivious
world, you can

00:33:29.910 --> 00:33:33.870
prove that 1 is unattainable
and the best possible

00:33:33.870 --> 00:33:40.450
constant factor is log base
2 of e, which was like 1.44.

00:33:40.450 --> 00:33:42.780
So that is the right
answer for the constant.

00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:46.140
Today we'll get a
constant here of 4.

00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:47.030
This is for search.

00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:53.490
But 4 has since been improved
to 1.44, so a tiny separation

00:33:53.490 --> 00:33:56.550
there between cache-oblivious
and external memory.

00:33:59.470 --> 00:34:01.500
Let's see.

00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:02.400
One more thing.

00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:24.090
Continuing over here
is priority queue.

00:34:26.810 --> 00:34:31.469
Cache-oblivious we can
do in the optimal time

00:34:31.469 --> 00:34:48.050
1 over B log base M
over B of N over B.

00:34:48.050 --> 00:34:51.080
Only catch with
that result is it

00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:54.215
assumes something called
the tall cache assumption.

00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:07.280
Let's see what I
want to say here.

00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:19.270
We'll say M is omega B
to the 1 plus epsilon.

00:35:19.270 --> 00:35:21.580
That's an ugly-looking omega.

00:35:26.690 --> 00:35:29.870
Certainly M is at least B.
If you have one cache line,

00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:32.330
you have M equal
B. But we'd like

00:35:32.330 --> 00:35:36.350
M to be a little bit bigger than
B. We'd like the cache to be--

00:35:36.350 --> 00:35:39.620
if M was at least B squared,
then the height of the cache

00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:42.080
would be at least as big as
the width of the cache, hence

00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:43.367
tall cache.

00:35:43.367 --> 00:35:45.200
But we don't even need
M equal to B squared.

00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:47.210
Just M to the--

00:35:47.210 --> 00:35:51.510
M equaling B to the
1.001 would be enough.

00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:52.985
Then you can get this result.

00:35:52.985 --> 00:35:56.240
And there's a theorem that
shows for cache-oblivious

00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:58.730
you need to assume this
tall cache assumption.

00:35:58.730 --> 00:36:03.010
You cannot achieve
this bound without it.

00:36:03.010 --> 00:36:08.760
But this is usually true for
real caches, so life is good.

00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:09.260
All right.

00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:13.060
So that's a quick summary
of cache-oblivious results.

00:36:13.060 --> 00:36:14.260
Any questions about those?

00:36:17.090 --> 00:36:24.950
Then we proceed into achieving
search trees log base B of N

00:36:24.950 --> 00:36:27.760
performance cache-obliviously.

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:29.729
Make it interesting,
because external memory,

00:36:29.729 --> 00:36:31.520
we already know how to
do it with a B-tree.

00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:44.166
So we did both models,
cache-oblivious B-tree

00:36:44.166 --> 00:36:45.390
is what remain.

00:36:51.890 --> 00:36:54.290
This was the first result
in cache-oblivious data

00:36:54.290 --> 00:36:55.490
structures.

00:36:55.490 --> 00:36:58.600
I'm going to start with
the static problem.

00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:10.805
Cache-oblivious
static search trees.

00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:20.420
This was actually in a MEng
thesis here by Harold Prokop.

00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:23.690
So the idea is very simple.

00:37:23.690 --> 00:37:26.060
We can't use B-trees because
we don't know what B is,

00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:28.640
so we'll use binary
search trees.

00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:31.490
Those have served
us well so far.

00:37:31.490 --> 00:37:36.085
So let's use a balanced
binary search tree.

00:37:36.085 --> 00:37:37.850
And because it's
static, might as well

00:37:37.850 --> 00:37:41.747
assume it's a perfect
balanced binary search tree.

00:37:41.747 --> 00:37:42.830
Let me draw one over here.

00:37:58.610 --> 00:38:00.053
I'll draw my favorite one.

00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:15.960
So how do you search in
a binary search tree?

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:18.150
Binary search.

00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:19.950
Our algorithm is fixed.

00:38:19.950 --> 00:38:23.130
So the only
flexibility we have is

00:38:23.130 --> 00:38:29.070
how we map this tree into the
sequential order in memory.

00:38:29.070 --> 00:38:31.800
Memory is an array.

00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:33.750
So for each of
these nodes, we get

00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:37.320
to assign some
order, some position

00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:40.080
in the array of memory.

00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:43.950
And then each of these
child pointers, that

00:38:43.950 --> 00:38:46.610
changes where they point to.

00:38:46.610 --> 00:38:48.180
And now
cache-obliviously, you're

00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:50.730
going to follow some
root to leaf path.

00:38:50.730 --> 00:38:52.320
You don't know which one.

00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:56.460
All of them are visiting
nodes in some order,

00:38:56.460 --> 00:38:58.260
which looks pretty random.

00:38:58.260 --> 00:38:59.760
In the array of
memory, it's going

00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:05.040
to be some sequence like this.

00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:07.380
We would like the
number of blocks

00:39:07.380 --> 00:39:12.160
that contain those nodes to
be relatively small somehow.

00:39:16.510 --> 00:39:17.820
So that's the hard part.

00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:19.680
Now, you could try level order.

00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:22.950
You could try in order,
pre order, post order.

00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:25.560
All of them fail.

00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:29.460
The right order is something
called van Emde Boas order.

00:39:44.980 --> 00:39:47.730
So let's say there are N nodes.

00:39:47.730 --> 00:39:53.910
What we're going to
do is carve the tree

00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:56.190
at the middle level of edges.

00:40:05.110 --> 00:40:08.720
So we have a tree like this.

00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:10.470
We divide in the middle.

00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:15.750
Leaves us with the top
part and many bottom parts.

00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:19.290
There's going to be about
square root of N nodes

00:40:19.290 --> 00:40:23.560
in each of these little
triangles, roughly speaking.

00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:25.410
The number of
triangles down here

00:40:25.410 --> 00:40:28.150
is going to be roughly
square root of N--

00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:31.605
I think I have written here
square root of N plus 1.

00:40:31.605 --> 00:40:34.740
It's a little overestimate,
because I multiply those two

00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:35.910
numbers, it's bigger than N.

00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:37.212
But it's roughly that.

00:40:37.212 --> 00:40:38.670
If there were root
N nodes up here,

00:40:38.670 --> 00:40:41.670
then there would be square
root of N plus 1 children,

00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:44.220
and square root of N
plus 1 things down there.

00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:49.140
So roughly, root N different
things, each of size root N.

00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:56.630
Then what we do is
recursively lay out

00:40:56.630 --> 00:41:05.280
all those triangles of
size roughly squared of N,

00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:09.160
and then concatenate.

00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:12.690
It's a very simple idea.

00:41:12.690 --> 00:41:15.700
Let's apply it to this tree.

00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:21.690
So I split in the middle
level and I recursively

00:41:21.690 --> 00:41:25.530
lay out this triangle up here--

00:41:25.530 --> 00:41:27.090
draw it as a box.

00:41:27.090 --> 00:41:28.770
Then I recursively lay out this.

00:41:28.770 --> 00:41:33.630
Then I recursively lay out
this and this and this.

00:41:33.630 --> 00:41:36.550
So up here, I mean,
to lay this out,

00:41:36.550 --> 00:41:39.410
I would again split
in the middle level,

00:41:39.410 --> 00:41:43.050
lay out this piece, so this
guy will go first, then

00:41:43.050 --> 00:41:45.180
this one, then this one.

00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:48.960
Now I'll go over and recursively
do this, so it's 4, 5, 6.

00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:58.346
Then this one, 7, 8, 9,
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.

00:41:58.346 --> 00:42:00.220
That is the order in
which I store the nodes.

00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:03.700
And I claim that's a good order.

00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:07.650
For example, if B equals
3, this looks really good,

00:42:07.650 --> 00:42:11.750
because then all of these
nodes are in the first block.

00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:15.300
And so I get to choose which
of these four children trees

00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:16.290
I should look at.

00:42:16.290 --> 00:42:19.490
I mean, I happen to go
here and then maybe here.

00:42:19.490 --> 00:42:23.340
I look at those two nodes,
look at their keys to decide,

00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:26.070
oh, I should go
into this branch.

00:42:26.070 --> 00:42:29.460
But I only pay one
memory transfer

00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:31.390
to look at all those nodes.

00:42:31.390 --> 00:42:34.110
So this looks like a tree
tuned for B equals 3.

00:42:34.110 --> 00:42:37.047
But it turns out it's tuned
for all B's simultaneously,

00:42:37.047 --> 00:42:38.130
if we do this recursively.

00:42:38.130 --> 00:42:40.684
It's hard to draw
a small example

00:42:40.684 --> 00:42:42.100
where you see all
the B's at once,

00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:45.885
but that's the best I can do.

00:42:45.885 --> 00:42:46.385
OK.

00:42:58.030 --> 00:43:01.250
Let's analyze this thing.

00:43:01.250 --> 00:43:04.310
So the order of
the nodes is clear.

00:43:04.310 --> 00:43:07.480
If you know what the van
Emde Boas data structure is,

00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:09.040
then you know why
it's called this.

00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:13.360
Otherwise, see lecture
10 or so in the future.

00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:16.490
Forget exactly where
we're covering it.

00:43:16.490 --> 00:43:18.550
So this order was not
invented by van Emde Boas,

00:43:18.550 --> 00:43:20.830
but it looks very similar
to something else that

00:43:20.830 --> 00:43:23.650
was invented by van Emde
Boas, so we call it that.

00:43:23.650 --> 00:43:26.560
But that's the name
of a guy, Peter.

00:43:29.170 --> 00:43:30.820
Analysis.

00:43:30.820 --> 00:43:31.872
Order's clear.

00:43:31.872 --> 00:43:32.830
The algorithm is clear.

00:43:32.830 --> 00:43:35.840
We follow our root to leaf path.

00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:41.860
What we claim is any root to
leaf path and any value of B,

00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:47.170
the number of blocks visited
is order log base B of N.

00:43:47.170 --> 00:43:54.190
So to do that, in the analysis
we get to know what B is.

00:43:54.190 --> 00:43:56.140
The algorithm didn't know.

00:43:56.140 --> 00:44:01.420
Algorithm here doesn't know
B and doesn't need to know B.

00:44:01.420 --> 00:44:05.070
But to analyze it, to prove
an order log base B of N,

00:44:05.070 --> 00:44:10.240
we need to know what B is.

00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:15.640
So while the algorithm
recurses all the way down,

00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:19.540
keeps dividing these blocks
into smaller and smaller pieces,

00:44:19.540 --> 00:44:21.320
we're going to look
at a particular level

00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:23.170
of that recursion.

00:44:23.170 --> 00:44:25.045
I'm going to call that
a level of detail.

00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:39.240
Say I call it straddling B.

00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:41.340
So my picture is going
to be the following.

00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:53.100
These little triangles are
going to be size less than B.

00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:58.490
But these big triangles are
size greater than or equal to B.

00:44:58.490 --> 00:45:00.000
OK.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:11.780
At some level of recursion
that happens, by monotonicity,

00:45:11.780 --> 00:45:12.280
I guess.

00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:23.540
I could keep going.

00:45:23.540 --> 00:45:26.662
I mean, this tree is going
to have substantial height.

00:45:26.662 --> 00:45:28.120
I don't really know
how tall it is,

00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:31.465
or that's sort of
the central question.

00:45:31.465 --> 00:45:32.590
Draw in some pointers here.

00:45:35.110 --> 00:45:36.630
But just look at--

00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:39.319
if you subdivide all
the big triangles

00:45:39.319 --> 00:45:41.110
until you get to these
small triangles that

00:45:41.110 --> 00:45:43.840
are size less than B,
then you stop recursing.

00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:46.810
Now, the algorithm, of course,
will recursively lay that out.

00:45:46.810 --> 00:45:49.210
But what we know, we
recursively lay things out

00:45:49.210 --> 00:45:52.540
and then we concatenate, meaning
the recursive layouts remain

00:45:52.540 --> 00:45:54.130
consecutive.

00:45:54.130 --> 00:45:56.740
We never like
interleave two layouts.

00:45:56.740 --> 00:45:59.410
So however this thing is laid
out, we don't really care,

00:45:59.410 --> 00:46:03.770
because at that point it's
going to be stored in memory,

00:46:03.770 --> 00:46:05.059
which is this giant array.

00:46:05.059 --> 00:46:06.850
It's going to be stored
in interval of size

00:46:06.850 --> 00:46:13.190
less than B. So at worst,
where are the block boundaries?

00:46:13.190 --> 00:46:16.960
Maybe draw that in red.

00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:20.440
Block boundaries are size B. We
don't know exactly how they're

00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:21.220
interspersed.

00:46:21.220 --> 00:46:25.040
Let's say these are
the block boundaries.

00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:28.990
So it could be that this little
subarray falls into two blocks,

00:46:28.990 --> 00:46:32.440
but at most two blocks.

00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:38.710
So the little triangles
of size less than B

00:46:38.710 --> 00:46:43.705
live in at most
two memory blocks.

00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:52.660
So to visit each of
these little triangles,

00:46:52.660 --> 00:46:55.260
we only spend two
memory reads at most.

00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:03.270
So all that's left is to
count how many of those

00:47:03.270 --> 00:47:11.565
little triangles do we need to
visit on a root to leaf path?

00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:18.150
I claim that's going
to be log base B of N.

00:47:18.150 --> 00:47:24.657
So I guess the first question
is, what is the height of one

00:47:24.657 --> 00:47:25.740
of these little triangles?

00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:31.230
Well, we start with
a tree of height

00:47:31.230 --> 00:47:34.594
log N. Then we divide it in
half and we divide it in half

00:47:34.594 --> 00:47:35.510
and divide it in half.

00:47:35.510 --> 00:47:38.430
And we take floors and
ceilings, whatever.

00:47:38.430 --> 00:47:41.940
But we repeatedly divide
the height in half.

00:47:41.940 --> 00:47:44.580
And we stop whenever the
number of nodes in there

00:47:44.580 --> 00:47:47.730
is less than B. So that
means the height is going

00:47:47.730 --> 00:47:52.950
to be theta log B.
In fact, it's going

00:47:52.950 --> 00:47:59.460
to be in the range
1/2 log B to log B,

00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:01.200
probably with a paren that way.

00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:05.744
Doesn't really matter, because
you stop as soon as you hit B.

00:48:05.744 --> 00:48:07.660
You're dividing the
height in half repeatedly.

00:48:07.660 --> 00:48:11.700
You might overshoot
by at most a half.

00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:12.930
That's it.

00:48:12.930 --> 00:48:14.970
So height is log B.

00:48:14.970 --> 00:48:17.730
So if we look along
a root to leaf path,

00:48:17.730 --> 00:48:19.410
each of these
things we visit, we

00:48:19.410 --> 00:48:24.470
make vertical progress
log B, theta log B.

00:48:24.470 --> 00:48:28.270
And the total vertical progress
we need to make is log N,

00:48:28.270 --> 00:48:32.535
and so it's log N
divided by log B.

00:48:32.535 --> 00:48:48.690
So I guess 4 times log
N, 2 log N over log B.

00:48:48.690 --> 00:48:51.350
Triangles, we reach a leaf.

00:48:54.074 --> 00:48:56.920
It's total progress we
need to make divided by 1/2

00:48:56.920 --> 00:49:01.200
log B here, progress
per triangle.

00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:04.820
So we get 2 times log base B of
N. And then for each triangle,

00:49:04.820 --> 00:49:07.100
we have to pay 2
memory reads, so

00:49:07.100 --> 00:49:16.430
this implies at most 4 log
base B of N memory transfers.

00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:24.020
And I implicitly assumed
here that B is not 1.

00:49:24.020 --> 00:49:29.710
Otherwise, need a B plus
1 here to be interesting.

00:49:29.710 --> 00:49:33.810
So long as B isn't 1,
then it doesn't matter.

00:49:33.810 --> 00:49:34.310
OK.

00:49:34.310 --> 00:49:36.680
So that's the log base B of
N analysis, actually really

00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:37.196
simple.

00:49:37.196 --> 00:49:38.570
Essentially what
we're doing here

00:49:38.570 --> 00:49:44.720
is binary searching on B in a
kind of weird way, using divide

00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:46.210
and conquer and recursion.

00:49:46.210 --> 00:49:48.320
So we say, well, maybe
B is the whole thing,

00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:51.090
then B equals N. Then we
don't have to do anything.

00:49:51.090 --> 00:49:52.500
Everything fits in a block.

00:49:52.500 --> 00:49:55.460
Otherwise, let's imagine
dividing here and supposing

00:49:55.460 --> 00:50:01.240
B is root N, and then
we need two accesses.

00:50:01.240 --> 00:50:04.640
But B might be smaller than
that, so we keep recursing,

00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:05.480
keep going down.

00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:07.550
And because we're dividing
in half each time--

00:50:09.780 --> 00:50:10.280
sorry.

00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:11.863
We're not binary
searching on B. We're

00:50:11.863 --> 00:50:15.830
binary searching on log
B, which is the height

00:50:15.830 --> 00:50:19.037
of a tree with B nodes in it.

00:50:19.037 --> 00:50:20.870
And that's exactly what
we can afford to do.

00:50:20.870 --> 00:50:22.190
And conveniently, it's
all we need to do,

00:50:22.190 --> 00:50:24.080
because to get log
base B of N correct,

00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:25.865
you only need to
get log B correct up

00:50:25.865 --> 00:50:26.740
to a constant factor.

00:50:29.510 --> 00:50:32.210
All right.

00:50:32.210 --> 00:50:34.080
Now, that was the easy part.

00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:36.540
Now the hard part is
to make this dynamic.

00:50:36.540 --> 00:50:38.270
This is where
things get exciting.

00:50:38.270 --> 00:50:41.022
This works fine
for a static tree.

00:50:41.022 --> 00:50:42.230
And this is how we do search.

00:50:42.230 --> 00:50:47.660
But we can't do inserts and
deletes in this world easily.

00:50:47.660 --> 00:50:50.395
But I'll show you how
to do it nonetheless.

00:51:05.450 --> 00:51:07.995
So this is what's called
a cache-oblivious B-tree.

00:51:15.350 --> 00:51:17.840
We're going to do
it in five steps.

00:51:20.350 --> 00:51:21.950
And the first step,
unfortunately,

00:51:21.950 --> 00:51:25.800
is delayed until next lecture,
so I need a black box.

00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:29.310
It's a very useful black box.

00:51:29.310 --> 00:51:32.840
It's actually one that we've
briefly talked about before,

00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:33.965
I think in the time travel.

00:51:40.939 --> 00:51:42.480
If you remember, in
time travel there

00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:44.396
was one black box, which
we still haven't seen

00:51:44.396 --> 00:51:47.080
but we will do finally
next lecture, which

00:51:47.080 --> 00:51:48.739
was you can insert
into a linked list

00:51:48.739 --> 00:51:50.530
and then given two
items in the linked list

00:51:50.530 --> 00:51:52.321
know which one comes
before which other one

00:51:52.321 --> 00:51:54.850
in constant time per operation.

00:51:54.850 --> 00:51:57.220
Closely related to that is
a slightly different problem

00:51:57.220 --> 00:51:58.900
called order file maintenance.

00:51:58.900 --> 00:52:01.840
Here's what it lets you do.

00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:08.320
You can store N elements,
N words in specified order,

00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:12.026
so just like it's a linked list.

00:52:12.026 --> 00:52:13.650
But we don't store
it as a linked list.

00:52:13.650 --> 00:52:18.745
We want to store it in
an array of linear size.

00:52:25.510 --> 00:52:27.890
So there's going to be some
blank spots in this array.

00:52:27.890 --> 00:52:32.410
We've got N items, an array
of size, say 2N or 1.1 times

00:52:32.410 --> 00:52:35.590
N, anything like
that will suffice.

00:52:35.590 --> 00:52:41.860
The rest, we call them
gaps, gaps in the array.

00:52:41.860 --> 00:52:47.250
And the updates-- so this is
physically what you have to do.

00:52:47.250 --> 00:52:50.320
You can change this
set of elements

00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:55.300
by either deleting an element
or inserting an element

00:52:55.300 --> 00:52:57.430
between two given elements.

00:53:09.776 --> 00:53:11.650
So this is just like
the linked list updates.

00:53:11.650 --> 00:53:13.358
I can delete somebody
from a linked list.

00:53:13.358 --> 00:53:15.640
I can insert a new item
in between two given

00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:16.930
items in the linked list.

00:53:16.930 --> 00:53:21.430
But now it has to be stored in
a physical array of linear size.

00:53:21.430 --> 00:53:24.370
Now, we can't do this
in constant time.

00:53:24.370 --> 00:53:45.320
But what we can do is
move elements around.

00:54:04.231 --> 00:54:04.730
OK.

00:54:04.730 --> 00:54:06.600
So let me draw a picture.

00:54:28.980 --> 00:54:31.080
So maybe we have
some elements here.

00:54:35.940 --> 00:54:38.880
They could be in sorted
order, maybe not.

00:54:42.590 --> 00:54:45.720
There are some gaps in between.

00:54:45.720 --> 00:54:50.235
I didn't mention it, but all
gaps will have constant size.

00:54:54.460 --> 00:54:58.710
So this will be
constant-sized gaps.

00:54:58.710 --> 00:55:02.250
And we're able to do things
like insert a new item

00:55:02.250 --> 00:55:04.140
right after 42.

00:55:04.140 --> 00:55:06.590
Let's say we insert 12.

00:55:06.590 --> 00:55:09.930
So 12, we could put it
right here, no problem.

00:55:09.930 --> 00:55:14.470
Now maybe we say insert
right after 42 the number 6.

00:55:14.470 --> 00:55:17.009
And we're like, oh,
there's no room to put 6.

00:55:17.009 --> 00:55:18.300
So I've got to move some stuff.

00:55:18.300 --> 00:55:23.100
Maybe I move 12 over here
and then I put 6 here.

00:55:23.100 --> 00:55:27.966
And then I say, OK, now insert
right after 42 the number 7.

00:55:27.966 --> 00:55:30.960
And you're like, uh-oh.

00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:37.920
I could move these guys over one
and then put 7 here, and so on.

00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:39.300
Obvious algorithm to do this.

00:55:39.300 --> 00:55:43.020
Takes linear time, linear
number of shifts in order

00:55:43.020 --> 00:55:44.400
to do one insertion.

00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:48.970
Claim is you can do an insertion
in log squared amortized.

00:55:48.970 --> 00:55:49.776
It's pretty cool.

00:55:49.776 --> 00:55:51.150
So worst case,
you'll still going

00:55:51.150 --> 00:55:52.740
to need to shift everybody.

00:55:52.740 --> 00:55:54.600
But just leaving
constant-sized gaps

00:55:54.600 --> 00:55:57.000
will be enough to reduce
amortized costs to log squared.

00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:58.916
And this is conjectured
optimal, though no one

00:55:58.916 --> 00:56:00.850
knows how to prove that.

00:56:00.850 --> 00:56:02.370
And that's order
file maintenance.

00:56:02.370 --> 00:56:04.380
Now, we're going to assume
this is a black box.

00:56:04.380 --> 00:56:08.430
Next lecture, we'll
actually do it.

00:56:08.430 --> 00:56:12.450
But I want to first
show you how it

00:56:12.450 --> 00:56:15.430
lets us get cache-oblivious
dynamic B-trees.

00:56:21.270 --> 00:56:23.535
Log base B of N,
insert, delete, search.

00:56:32.520 --> 00:56:34.115
OK.

00:56:34.115 --> 00:56:36.240
We're going to use an
ordered file maintenance data

00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:41.910
structure to store our keys,
just stick them in there.

00:56:41.910 --> 00:56:44.100
Now, this is good--

00:56:44.100 --> 00:56:46.726
well, it's really not
good for anything,

00:56:46.726 --> 00:56:48.330
although it's a starting point.

00:56:48.330 --> 00:56:51.000
It can do updates in
log squared of N--

00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:52.710
I didn't mention this part--

00:56:52.710 --> 00:56:55.110
in a constant number of scans.

00:56:55.110 --> 00:56:58.230
So think of these as
this kind of shift.

00:56:58.230 --> 00:57:01.980
I have to scan left to
right, copy 23 to the left,

00:57:01.980 --> 00:57:04.560
42 to the left, and so on.

00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:07.510
Scans are things we
know how to do fast in N

00:57:07.510 --> 00:57:09.990
over B memory transfers.

00:57:09.990 --> 00:57:12.075
So if you're going
to do log squared--

00:57:12.075 --> 00:57:14.880
if you're going to update
an interval log squared guys

00:57:14.880 --> 00:57:16.890
using constant
number of scans, this

00:57:16.890 --> 00:57:22.920
will take log squared N
over B memory transfers.

00:57:30.370 --> 00:57:31.570
Not quite the bound we want.

00:57:31.570 --> 00:57:33.440
We want log base B of N.

00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:36.220
This could be larger or
smaller than log base B of N.

00:57:36.220 --> 00:57:39.160
It depends how big B is.

00:57:39.160 --> 00:57:40.930
But don't worry
about it for now.

00:57:40.930 --> 00:57:43.210
This is still-- at
least it's poly log.

00:57:43.210 --> 00:57:45.300
Updates are kind
of vaguely decent.

00:57:45.300 --> 00:57:47.410
We'll improve them later.

00:57:47.410 --> 00:57:50.830
On the other hand, search
is really bad here.

00:57:50.830 --> 00:57:52.650
I mean, we're
maintaining the items--

00:57:52.650 --> 00:57:55.150
I didn't mention it, but we
will actually maintain the items

00:57:55.150 --> 00:57:55.997
in sorted order.

00:57:55.997 --> 00:57:57.580
So yeah, you could
do a binary search.

00:57:57.580 --> 00:57:59.830
But binary search is really
bad cache-obliviously,

00:57:59.830 --> 00:58:01.621
because most of the
time you'll be visiting

00:58:01.621 --> 00:58:04.360
a new block until the very end.

00:58:04.360 --> 00:58:07.510
So binary search-- this
is a fun exercise--

00:58:07.510 --> 00:58:12.670
is log N minus log B. We
want log N divided by log B.

00:58:12.670 --> 00:58:14.290
So we can't use binary search.

00:58:14.290 --> 00:58:18.580
We need to use van Emde
Boas layouts, this thing.

00:58:18.580 --> 00:58:20.200
So we just plug these together.

00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:22.690
We take this static
search tree and stick it

00:58:22.690 --> 00:58:26.000
on top of an ordered file
maintenance data structure.

00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:32.980
So here we have a van Emde
Boas layout static tree

00:58:32.980 --> 00:58:37.980
on top of this thing,
which is an ordered file.

00:58:41.980 --> 00:58:43.344
And we have cross-linking.

00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:50.580
Really here we have gaps.

00:58:50.580 --> 00:58:52.590
And we don't store
the gaps up here.

00:58:52.590 --> 00:58:53.380
Or do we?

00:58:53.380 --> 00:58:53.880
Yeah, sure.

00:58:53.880 --> 00:58:54.950
We do, actually.

00:58:54.950 --> 00:58:56.010
Store them all.

00:58:56.010 --> 00:58:57.360
Put it all in there.

00:58:57.360 --> 00:58:57.860
All right.

00:58:57.860 --> 00:58:59.568
I'm going to have an
actual example here.

00:59:14.100 --> 00:59:30.760
Let's do it 3 slash
7, 9 slash 16, 21, 42.

00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:47.850
OK.

00:59:47.850 --> 00:59:49.080
Cross-links between.

00:59:49.080 --> 00:59:50.250
I won't draw all of them.

00:59:50.250 --> 00:59:53.210
Then we store all the
data up here as well.

00:59:58.860 --> 01:00:01.130
And then the internal
nodes here are

01:00:01.130 --> 01:00:03.990
going to store the max
of the whole subtree.

01:00:03.990 --> 01:00:05.565
So here the max is 3.

01:00:05.565 --> 01:00:15.510
Here the max is 9,
16, 42, 42, and 9.

01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:20.934
If I store the max of every
subtree, then at the root.

01:00:20.934 --> 01:00:23.350
If I want to decide should I
go left or should I go right,

01:00:23.350 --> 01:00:25.282
I look at the max
of the left subtree

01:00:25.282 --> 01:00:26.740
and that will let
me know whether I

01:00:26.740 --> 01:00:29.020
should go left or right.

01:00:29.020 --> 01:00:31.780
So now I can do binary search.

01:00:31.780 --> 01:00:33.870
I do a search up here.

01:00:33.870 --> 01:00:35.650
I want to do a search,
I search the tree.

01:00:35.650 --> 01:00:38.620
This thing is laid
out just like this.

01:00:38.620 --> 01:00:46.980
And so we pay log base B of
N to search up here, plus 1,

01:00:46.980 --> 01:00:48.350
if you want.

01:00:48.350 --> 01:00:51.230
And then we get to a
key and we're done.

01:00:51.230 --> 01:00:52.810
That's all we wanted to know.

01:00:52.810 --> 01:00:55.090
So search is now good.

01:00:55.090 --> 01:00:58.250
Updates, two problems.

01:00:58.250 --> 01:01:01.892
One is that updating just
this bottom part is slow.

01:01:01.892 --> 01:01:03.850
Second problem is if I
change the bottom thing,

01:01:03.850 --> 01:01:06.620
now I have to change
the top thing.

01:01:06.620 --> 01:01:08.500
But let's look at
that part first.

01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:10.780
It's not so bad to update--

01:01:10.780 --> 01:01:14.330
I mean, this structure stays
the same, unless N doubles.

01:01:14.330 --> 01:01:17.020
Then we rebuild the
entire data structure.

01:01:17.020 --> 01:01:19.160
But basically, this
thing will stay the same.

01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:21.580
It's just data is moving
around in this array.

01:01:21.580 --> 01:01:23.620
And we have to
update which values

01:01:23.620 --> 01:01:24.977
are stored in this structure.

01:01:24.977 --> 01:01:26.560
The layout of the
structure, the order

01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:28.180
of the nodes, that
all stays fixed.

01:01:28.180 --> 01:01:29.680
It's just the numbers
that are being

01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:31.360
written in here that change.

01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:34.300
That's the cool idea.

01:01:34.300 --> 01:01:41.490
So that's step 2.

01:01:41.490 --> 01:01:42.510
Let's go to step 3.

01:01:52.650 --> 01:01:54.880
I actually kind of wanted
that exact picture.

01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:55.760
That's OK.

01:01:58.940 --> 01:02:01.520
I need to specify
how updates are done.

01:02:05.610 --> 01:02:08.180
So let's say I want
to do an insertion.

01:02:12.070 --> 01:02:14.950
If I want to insert a new
key, I search for the key.

01:02:14.950 --> 01:02:17.830
Maybe it fits between 7 and 9.

01:02:17.830 --> 01:02:20.680
Then I do the insertion
in the bottom structure

01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:21.835
in the ordered file.

01:02:21.835 --> 01:02:24.190
So we want to insert 8.

01:02:24.190 --> 01:02:25.960
These guys move around.

01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:29.180
Then I have to propagate
that information up here.

01:02:29.180 --> 01:02:31.210
And the key thing
I want to specify

01:02:31.210 --> 01:02:34.950
is an update does a search.

01:02:34.950 --> 01:02:39.220
Then it updates
the ordered file.

01:02:39.220 --> 01:02:44.830
That's going to take
log squared N over B.

01:02:44.830 --> 01:02:47.950
And then we want to
propagate changes

01:02:47.950 --> 01:03:02.660
into the tree in post-order,
post-order traversal.

01:03:02.660 --> 01:03:05.660
That's the one thing
I wanted to specify,

01:03:05.660 --> 01:03:09.270
because it actually matters in
what order I update the item.

01:03:09.270 --> 01:03:11.820
So for example, suppose
I move 9 to the right

01:03:11.820 --> 01:03:14.720
and then I insert 8 here.

01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:18.440
So then this thing--

01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:22.930
let's do it, what changes
in that situation.

01:03:22.930 --> 01:03:27.140
9 will change to
an 8 here, which

01:03:27.140 --> 01:03:29.600
means this value has
to change to an 8

01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:32.630
and this value needs
to change to an 8.

01:03:32.630 --> 01:03:35.570
And this one I can't
quite update yet,

01:03:35.570 --> 01:03:37.460
because I need to
do the other tree.

01:03:37.460 --> 01:03:43.010
So here I change
this value to a 9.

01:03:43.010 --> 01:03:45.470
This one doesn't
change, so this is OK.

01:03:45.470 --> 01:03:46.700
This is OK.

01:03:46.700 --> 01:03:48.000
This is OK.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.210
Just taking the maxes
as I propagate up.

01:03:50.210 --> 01:03:53.330
So the red things are the
nodes that I touch and compute

01:03:53.330 --> 01:03:53.900
the maxes of.

01:03:53.900 --> 01:03:55.983
And the order I did it was
a post-order traversal.

01:03:55.983 --> 01:03:57.830
I need to do a post-order
traversal in order

01:03:57.830 --> 01:03:59.270
to compute maxes.

01:03:59.270 --> 01:04:01.130
I need to know what
the max of this subtree

01:04:01.130 --> 01:04:04.240
is and this subtree before I can
re-compute the max of the root.

01:04:06.860 --> 01:04:09.100
So it's really the
obvious algorithm.

01:04:09.100 --> 01:04:11.050
Now, the interesting
part is the analysis.

01:04:19.590 --> 01:04:21.662
So searches we've
already analyzed.

01:04:21.662 --> 01:04:23.120
We don't need to
do anything there.

01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:29.790
That's log base B of N.

01:04:29.790 --> 01:04:32.532
But updates are the
interesting thing to analyze.

01:04:43.860 --> 01:04:49.380
And again we're going to look
at the level of detail that

01:04:49.380 --> 01:04:53.070
straddles B, just like before.

01:05:01.490 --> 01:05:03.350
So let me draw a good picture.

01:05:20.182 --> 01:05:21.890
I'm going to draw it
slightly differently

01:05:21.890 --> 01:05:23.098
from how I drew it last time.

01:05:40.341 --> 01:05:40.840
OK.

01:05:44.525 --> 01:05:45.900
What I'm drawing
here is actually

01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:48.510
the bottom of the tree.

01:05:48.510 --> 01:05:50.760
So a real tree is like this.

01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:52.820
And I'm looking at
the bottom, where

01:05:52.820 --> 01:05:54.570
the leaves are, because
I care about where

01:05:54.570 --> 01:05:56.960
I connect to this ordered file.

01:05:56.960 --> 01:05:59.700
So there's the ordered
file at the bottom.

01:05:59.700 --> 01:06:01.945
And I'm refining each
triangle recursively

01:06:01.945 --> 01:06:03.570
until they're size
less than B. They're

01:06:03.570 --> 01:06:06.900
going to be somewhere
between root B and B.

01:06:06.900 --> 01:06:13.344
These big triangles
are bigger than B. OK.

01:06:13.344 --> 01:06:15.360
So that's where I want
to look at things.

01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:19.015
Now, when we update
in the ordered file,

01:06:19.015 --> 01:06:19.890
we have this theorem.

01:06:19.890 --> 01:06:22.990
It says you move
elements in an interval.

01:06:22.990 --> 01:06:24.600
So what changes is an interval.

01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:27.960
The interval has size
log squared N amortized.

01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:33.900
So we are updating
some interval here,

01:06:33.900 --> 01:06:35.220
maybe something like this.

01:06:39.450 --> 01:06:44.509
And so all of these
items change, let's say.

01:06:44.509 --> 01:06:46.050
Now, this is not
going to be too big.

01:06:46.050 --> 01:06:47.850
It's going to be log
square N amortized.

01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:55.660
And all of the
ancestors of those nodes

01:06:55.660 --> 01:06:58.090
have to be updated, potentially.

01:06:58.090 --> 01:07:01.150
So all these guys are
going to get updated.

01:07:01.150 --> 01:07:05.770
Some of this tree, this
path, all of this stuff

01:07:05.770 --> 01:07:09.070
is going to get updated,
some of this stuff,

01:07:09.070 --> 01:07:10.930
the path up to here.

01:07:10.930 --> 01:07:14.760
The path up to the root
gets updated, in general,

01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:16.220
and all these nodes get touched.

01:07:16.220 --> 01:07:20.680
Now, I claim that's cheap, no
more expensive than updating

01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:23.442
down here.

01:07:23.442 --> 01:07:24.150
Let's prove that.

01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:46.950
OK.

01:07:46.950 --> 01:07:50.110
First issue is, in what order
do I visit the nodes here?

01:07:50.110 --> 01:07:52.960
I want to think about
this post-order.

01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:57.170
Maybe I'll use another
color to draw that.

01:07:57.170 --> 01:08:00.760
So let's say we start
by updating this guy.

01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:03.000
We update this value.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:03.910
Then we go--

01:08:03.910 --> 01:08:06.220
I'm doing a post-order
traversal, this tree.

01:08:06.220 --> 01:08:08.050
Once I've completely
finished here,

01:08:08.050 --> 01:08:14.350
I can go up here, maybe go up
here, visit over down this way,

01:08:14.350 --> 01:08:16.080
fix all the maxes here.

01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:18.220
Then I go up, fix
all the maxes here,

01:08:18.220 --> 01:08:20.229
fix all the maxes, the maxes.

01:08:20.229 --> 01:08:24.170
When I come up, then I can fix
the maxes up here, and so on.

01:08:24.170 --> 01:08:24.670
OK.

01:08:24.670 --> 01:08:26.459
Think about that order.

01:08:26.459 --> 01:08:28.209
If you just look at
the big picture, which

01:08:28.209 --> 01:08:30.949
is which triangles are
we visiting, what we do

01:08:30.949 --> 01:08:33.490
is we visit this triangle, then
this one, then this triangle,

01:08:33.490 --> 01:08:36.580
then this one, then this
triangle, then this one.

01:08:36.580 --> 01:08:38.080
I guess this is
the better picture.

01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:40.580
This triangle, left one,
this triangle, next child,

01:08:40.580 --> 01:08:43.970
this parent, next child,
this parent, next child.

01:08:43.970 --> 01:08:46.990
And when we're done, we go
over to the next big triangle.

01:08:46.990 --> 01:08:49.240
Within a big
triangle, we alternate

01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:51.550
between two small triangles.

01:08:51.550 --> 01:08:57.279
As long as we have
four blocks of cache,

01:08:57.279 --> 01:08:58.899
this will be good,
because there's

01:08:58.899 --> 01:09:01.267
at most two blocks for
this little triangle,

01:09:01.267 --> 01:09:03.100
at most two blocks for
this little triangle.

01:09:03.100 --> 01:09:04.750
So jumping back and
forth between these

01:09:04.750 --> 01:09:07.479
is basically free.

01:09:07.479 --> 01:09:12.640
So we assume-- white chalk.

01:09:17.170 --> 01:09:22.130
We assume that we have at
least four blocks of cache.

01:09:22.130 --> 01:09:37.840
Post-order traversal alternates
between two little triangles.

01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:40.460
So this part is free.

01:09:40.460 --> 01:09:42.609
The only issue is, how
many little triangles

01:09:42.609 --> 01:09:44.560
do I need to load overall?

01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:49.819
Sorry.

01:09:49.819 --> 01:09:52.149
I should say I'm just looking
at the little triangles

01:09:52.149 --> 01:09:54.640
in the bottom two levels.

01:09:54.640 --> 01:10:02.041
So this is in the
bottom two levels.

01:10:02.041 --> 01:10:02.540
Sorry.

01:10:02.540 --> 01:10:03.581
I forgot to mention that.

01:10:03.581 --> 01:10:06.880
As soon as you go outside
the bottom big triangle,

01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:08.380
let's not think about it yet.

01:10:08.380 --> 01:10:10.610
Worry about that later.

01:10:10.610 --> 01:10:12.930
So just looking at these
bottom two levels that I drew,

01:10:12.930 --> 01:10:14.565
we're just doing
this alternation.

01:10:14.565 --> 01:10:16.690
And so the only issue is,
how many little triangles

01:10:16.690 --> 01:10:18.320
do I have to load?

01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:22.390
So there could be these guys.

01:10:22.390 --> 01:10:25.650
These guys are good, because
I'm touching all these nodes.

01:10:25.650 --> 01:10:28.030
The number of nodes
here was bigger than B,

01:10:28.030 --> 01:10:30.910
so if I take this divided
by B in the ceiling,

01:10:30.910 --> 01:10:33.400
the ceiling doesn't hurt me,
because the overall size is

01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:34.915
bigger than B.

01:10:34.915 --> 01:10:36.790
These guys I have to be
a little bit careful.

01:10:36.790 --> 01:10:39.250
Here the ceiling might
hurt me, because I only

01:10:39.250 --> 01:10:40.370
read some of these nodes.

01:10:40.370 --> 01:10:41.870
It may be much less
than B. It could

01:10:41.870 --> 01:10:46.240
be as low as root B. I divide
by B, take the ceiling, I get 1,

01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:49.870
so I have to pay 1 at the
beginning, 1 at the end.

01:10:49.870 --> 01:10:53.710
But in between, I
get to divide by B.

01:10:53.710 --> 01:10:58.420
So the number of little
triangles in the bottom two

01:10:58.420 --> 01:11:13.720
levels that I visit is going to
be 1 plus log squared N over B

01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:15.140
amortized.

01:11:15.140 --> 01:11:18.010
The size of the interval
is log squared N amortized,

01:11:18.010 --> 01:11:20.650
so this would be if I'm perfect.

01:11:20.650 --> 01:11:23.270
But I get a plus 1 because
of various ceilings.

01:11:27.070 --> 01:11:34.720
And also, the number
of blocks is the same,

01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:36.400
because each of these
little triangles

01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:40.780
fits inside at most two blocks.

01:11:40.780 --> 01:11:43.830
So it's going to be order 1
plus log squared N over B.

01:11:43.830 --> 01:11:44.330
OK.

01:11:44.330 --> 01:11:51.940
So I can touch all
those in this much time,

01:11:51.940 --> 01:11:54.610
because I assume that I can
alternate between two of them

01:11:54.610 --> 01:11:55.630
quickly.

01:11:55.630 --> 01:11:58.030
And once I finish one
of these leaf blocks,

01:11:58.030 --> 01:12:01.990
I never touch it again, so I
visit each block essentially

01:12:01.990 --> 01:12:06.830
only once as long as
my cache is this big.

01:12:06.830 --> 01:12:07.330
Cool.

01:12:07.330 --> 01:12:09.038
So that deals with
the bottom two levels.

01:12:09.038 --> 01:12:11.680
I claim the bottom two
levels only pay this.

01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:14.200
And we were already paying that
to update the ordered file,

01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:16.140
so it's no worse.

01:12:16.140 --> 01:12:20.620
Now, there's the levels above
this one that we can't see.

01:12:20.620 --> 01:12:24.090
I claim that's also OK.

01:12:24.090 --> 01:12:24.960
Sorry.

01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:35.260
Also need number of memory
transfers is equal to that.

01:12:35.260 --> 01:12:35.760
OK.

01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:37.050
One more part of the argument.

01:12:51.010 --> 01:12:56.000
Levels above the bottom two.

01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:01.930
Nice thing about the
levels above the bottom two

01:13:01.930 --> 01:13:07.281
is there aren't
too many triangles.

01:13:07.281 --> 01:13:07.780
All right.

01:13:07.780 --> 01:13:09.571
Well, there aren't too
many nodes involved.

01:13:09.571 --> 01:13:11.260
Let's see.

01:13:11.260 --> 01:13:15.730
So down here, there were
like log squared N nodes.

01:13:15.730 --> 01:13:17.470
There was a lot of nodes.

01:13:17.470 --> 01:13:20.530
Once I go up two levels,
how many of these nodes

01:13:20.530 --> 01:13:22.230
can there be, these roots?

01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:29.020
Well, it was log
squared N at the bottom.

01:13:29.020 --> 01:13:32.300
And then I basically shaved
off a factor of B here,

01:13:32.300 --> 01:13:35.380
so the number of these roots
is at most log squared N

01:13:35.380 --> 01:13:40.150
over B. That's small.

01:13:40.150 --> 01:13:42.610
For those nodes, I could
afford to do an entire memory

01:13:42.610 --> 01:13:44.110
transfer for every single node.

01:13:47.150 --> 01:13:51.950
So the number of nodes
that need updating--

01:13:51.950 --> 01:14:02.110
these are ancestors--
is order log squared

01:14:02.110 --> 01:14:07.507
N over B. That's the number
of leaves down there.

01:14:07.507 --> 01:14:09.340
At some point, you reach
the common ancestor

01:14:09.340 --> 01:14:10.390
of those leaves.

01:14:10.390 --> 01:14:14.390
That tree-- so here,
draw a big picture.

01:14:14.390 --> 01:14:18.190
Here's the bottom two layers.

01:14:21.340 --> 01:14:22.360
We're shaving that off.

01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:31.690
Up here, the number of nodes
here, these roots that we're

01:14:31.690 --> 01:14:36.340
dealing with, that's the
log squared N over B.

01:14:36.340 --> 01:14:38.920
So if we build a
tree on those nodes,

01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:41.440
total number of nodes
in here is only log

01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:45.640
squared N over B times 2,
because it's a binary tree.

01:14:45.640 --> 01:14:47.890
But then there's also
these nodes up here.

01:14:47.890 --> 01:14:50.240
This is potentially log N nodes.

01:14:53.099 --> 01:14:54.640
So number of nodes
that need updating

01:14:54.640 --> 01:15:00.520
is at most this plus log
N. So what's going on here

01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:04.330
is we first analyzed
the bottom two layers.

01:15:04.330 --> 01:15:07.000
That was OK because of
this ordering thing,

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.910
that we're only dealing
with two triangles at once

01:15:09.910 --> 01:15:13.020
and therefore we pay
this size divided by B,

01:15:13.020 --> 01:15:14.320
log squared N over B.

01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:17.290
Then there's the common
ancestors of those nodes.

01:15:17.290 --> 01:15:20.790
That forms a little binary tree
of size log squared N over B.

01:15:20.790 --> 01:15:23.270
For these nodes,
this triangle up

01:15:23.270 --> 01:15:26.740
here, we can afford to pay one
memory transfer for every node,

01:15:26.740 --> 01:15:31.720
so we don't care that we're
efficient up here, which is--

01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:34.035
I mean, well, let's not
worry about whether we are.

01:15:34.035 --> 01:15:35.125
It doesn't matter.

01:15:35.125 --> 01:15:48.100
So for these nodes, we pay at
most one memory transfer each.

01:15:48.100 --> 01:15:50.410
And so we pay at most log
squared N over B for them.

01:15:50.410 --> 01:15:53.950
That's fine, because we
already paid that much.

01:15:53.950 --> 01:15:55.780
And finally, we have
to pay for these nodes

01:15:55.780 --> 01:15:59.170
up here, which are from the
common ancestors of these guys

01:15:59.170 --> 01:16:00.212
up to the root.

01:16:00.212 --> 01:16:02.170
That has length at most
log N. Could be smaller

01:16:02.170 --> 01:16:05.120
if this was a big interval.

01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:15.970
So for these guys, we pay
order log base B of N. Why?

01:16:15.970 --> 01:16:18.740
Because this is a
root to node path.

01:16:18.740 --> 01:16:20.260
And this is the static analysis.

01:16:20.260 --> 01:16:22.720
We already know that
following a root to node path

01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:25.810
we pay at most log base B of N.

01:16:25.810 --> 01:16:28.440
So we pay log base
B of N plus log

01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:31.810
squared N over B for this, plus
log squared N over B for this,

01:16:31.810 --> 01:16:36.730
plus log squared N over
B for the ordered file.

01:16:36.730 --> 01:16:41.650
So overall running
time for an update

01:16:41.650 --> 01:16:49.780
is log base B of N plus
log squared N over B.

01:16:49.780 --> 01:16:51.460
We actually paid log
base B of N twice,

01:16:51.460 --> 01:16:53.530
once to do the initial search.

01:16:53.530 --> 01:16:56.190
I said an update first
has to search for the key.

01:16:56.190 --> 01:16:57.490
Then it updates the order file.

01:16:57.490 --> 01:17:00.160
That's where we've paid the
first log squared N over B.

01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:02.980
And then to propagate all
the changes up the tree,

01:17:02.980 --> 01:17:05.710
we pay log squared N
over B for this part,

01:17:05.710 --> 01:17:07.870
and then another log base
B of N for this part.

01:17:10.410 --> 01:17:10.910
OK.

01:17:10.910 --> 01:17:14.080
That's updates with a bad bound.

01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:15.890
It turns out we're almost there.

01:17:15.890 --> 01:17:18.043
So at this point we
have searches optimal,

01:17:18.043 --> 01:17:20.376
because searches are just
searching through the van Emde

01:17:20.376 --> 01:17:20.920
Boas thing.

01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:22.300
That's log base B of N.

01:17:22.300 --> 01:17:25.180
Updates, not quite optimal.

01:17:25.180 --> 01:17:27.885
I mean not quite matching
a B-tree, I should say,

01:17:27.885 --> 01:17:30.010
because it's not an optimal
bound we're aiming for.

01:17:30.010 --> 01:17:32.070
We're just aiming for B-trees.

01:17:32.070 --> 01:17:36.010
We'd want to get this
bound, same as searching.

01:17:36.010 --> 01:17:39.580
But we have this
extra term, which

01:17:39.580 --> 01:17:43.690
if B is small, for
example if B is log N,

01:17:43.690 --> 01:17:46.890
this term will be
bigger than this one.

01:17:46.890 --> 01:17:50.160
The breakpoint is when B
equals log n times log log N.

01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:51.700
So for small B, we're not happy.

01:17:51.700 --> 01:17:54.650
And we want to be happy
for all B's simultaneously.

01:17:54.650 --> 01:17:57.240
So I want to fix this.

01:17:57.240 --> 01:18:00.990
We're going to fix it
using a general technique,

01:18:00.990 --> 01:18:04.420
great technique,
called indirection.

01:18:04.420 --> 01:18:08.880
So this is step 5, indirection.

01:18:12.310 --> 01:18:14.800
The idea is simple.

01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:20.880
We want to use the
previous data structure

01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:26.380
on N over log N items.

01:18:26.380 --> 01:18:29.250
And, well, we need to store N
items, so where do we put them?

01:18:29.250 --> 01:18:31.060
On the bottom.

01:18:31.060 --> 01:18:35.370
So I'm going to have theta
log N nodes down here,

01:18:35.370 --> 01:18:39.040
theta log N nodes next to them--

01:18:39.040 --> 01:18:41.550
or items, I should say.

01:18:41.550 --> 01:18:44.500
Theta log N.

01:18:44.500 --> 01:18:45.290
OK.

01:18:45.290 --> 01:18:48.840
And then one of these items,
let's say the min item,

01:18:48.840 --> 01:18:50.310
gets stored in this tree.

01:18:50.310 --> 01:18:53.730
The min item over here
gets stored in this tree.

01:18:53.730 --> 01:18:58.840
The min item here
gets stored up here.

01:18:58.840 --> 01:18:59.360
OK.

01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:00.705
So this item only--

01:19:00.705 --> 01:19:02.810
the data structure
we just developed,

01:19:02.810 --> 01:19:05.990
I only store N over
log N of the items.

01:19:05.990 --> 01:19:08.180
The rest that fit in
between those items

01:19:08.180 --> 01:19:09.830
are stored down here.

01:19:09.830 --> 01:19:12.800
Now I use standard
B-tree tricks, actually.

01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:16.470
If I want to do an insertion,
how do I do a search?

01:19:16.470 --> 01:19:18.200
I follow a root to leaf path.

01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:21.500
And then I do a linear scan
of this entire structure.

01:19:21.500 --> 01:19:23.780
How much does it cost to
do a linear scan of log N?

01:19:23.780 --> 01:19:28.770
Only log N divided by B. This
is smaller than log base B of N,

01:19:28.770 --> 01:19:32.551
so the hard part of search
is the log base B of N.

01:19:32.551 --> 01:19:33.050
OK.

01:19:33.050 --> 01:19:33.980
How do I do an update?

01:19:33.980 --> 01:19:35.450
Well, first, I
search for the guy.

01:19:35.450 --> 01:19:38.210
I find the block that it
fits into and just insert

01:19:38.210 --> 01:19:41.180
into that block.

01:19:41.180 --> 01:19:42.320
Done.

01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:45.170
As long as this block
doesn't get too big,

01:19:45.170 --> 01:19:47.060
how do I insert into a block?

01:19:47.060 --> 01:19:48.970
Rewrite the entire block.

01:19:48.970 --> 01:19:49.970
It's a scan.

01:19:49.970 --> 01:19:52.190
It only takes log
N over B, so it's

01:19:52.190 --> 01:19:54.740
basically free to rewrite
this entire block every time

01:19:54.740 --> 01:19:59.210
as long as it has size at most
log N. If it gets too full,

01:19:59.210 --> 01:20:03.340
then I split it into two
parts that are half-full.

01:20:03.340 --> 01:20:06.560
So in general, each
of these blocks

01:20:06.560 --> 01:20:14.294
will maintain the size to be
between 1/4 log N and log N.

01:20:14.294 --> 01:20:15.710
So if it gets
bigger than log N, I

01:20:15.710 --> 01:20:17.840
split into two guys of 1/2 size.

01:20:17.840 --> 01:20:20.120
If it gets smaller
than 1/4 log N,

01:20:20.120 --> 01:20:22.430
then I'll merge it with
one of its neighbors

01:20:22.430 --> 01:20:25.637
and then possibly
have to re-split it.

01:20:25.637 --> 01:20:27.470
Or you can think of it
as stealing neighbors

01:20:27.470 --> 01:20:29.090
from your siblings.

01:20:29.090 --> 01:20:31.190
That's what you do in B-trees.

01:20:31.190 --> 01:20:33.620
But with a constant number
of merges and splits,

01:20:33.620 --> 01:20:36.000
you can restore the property
that these guys have

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:39.110
sizes very close to
1/2 log N. And so

01:20:39.110 --> 01:20:41.030
if they end up getting
full, that means

01:20:41.030 --> 01:20:42.440
you inserted 1/2 log N items.

01:20:42.440 --> 01:20:43.940
If they ended up
getting empty, that

01:20:43.940 --> 01:20:48.170
means you deleted
1/4 log N items.

01:20:48.170 --> 01:20:51.890
And so in both cases, you
have log N items to charge to.

01:20:51.890 --> 01:20:53.870
Whenever you do an
update up here--

01:20:53.870 --> 01:20:55.640
so we update up here
every time we split

01:20:55.640 --> 01:20:57.740
or merge down here,
because this guy has

01:20:57.740 --> 01:21:01.070
to keep track of the blocks,
not the items in the blocks.

01:21:01.070 --> 01:21:06.320
So we effectively
slow down the updates

01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:21.210
in the top structure
by a factor log N,

01:21:21.210 --> 01:21:24.720
which is great, because
we take this update bound

01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:29.070
and we get to divide it by log
N, which removes this square.

01:21:29.070 --> 01:21:31.020
So we end up with--

01:21:34.410 --> 01:21:40.770
so we used to have log base B
of N plus log squared N over B.

01:21:40.770 --> 01:21:45.030
We get to divide
that by log N, plus

01:21:45.030 --> 01:21:50.310
we have to do this
part at the bottom.

01:21:50.310 --> 01:21:55.650
Plus we're doing log N
over B at the bottom.

01:21:55.650 --> 01:21:59.850
So basically, this log
cancels with this square,

01:21:59.850 --> 01:22:01.650
so this is log N over B as well.

01:22:01.650 --> 01:22:04.260
This thing gets even
smaller, so we end up

01:22:04.260 --> 01:22:07.980
being able to do
updates in log N over B.

01:22:07.980 --> 01:22:09.870
Not really though,
because at the beginning,

01:22:09.870 --> 01:22:12.369
we have to do a search to figure
out where to do the update.

01:22:12.369 --> 01:22:13.950
If you knew where
you had to update,

01:22:13.950 --> 01:22:15.120
you could update
a little faster.

01:22:15.120 --> 01:22:16.495
You could update
in log N divided

01:22:16.495 --> 01:22:18.420
by B. If you don't
know where to update,

01:22:18.420 --> 01:22:23.430
you've got to spend log base
B of N to search initially.

01:22:23.430 --> 01:22:25.170
But that's the fun part.

01:22:25.170 --> 01:22:27.030
We can now update
this data structure

01:22:27.030 --> 01:22:30.090
fast, just with this one layer
of indirection with log N

01:22:30.090 --> 01:22:32.736
chunks at the bottom, speeding
this data structure up

01:22:32.736 --> 01:22:34.110
by a factor of
log N for updates.

01:22:34.110 --> 01:22:35.401
Searches don't take any longer.

01:22:35.401 --> 01:22:37.400
You just pay this
extra term, which

01:22:37.400 --> 01:22:40.334
was already much smaller than
what we were paying before.

01:22:40.334 --> 01:22:41.280
Phew.

01:22:41.280 --> 01:22:44.460
That's cache-oblivious
B-trees, other than ordered

01:22:44.460 --> 01:22:47.420
file maintenance, which
we'll do next class.
