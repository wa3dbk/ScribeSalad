00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.240
PROFESSOR: All right today we
begin a topic dear to my heart.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.430
It's a problem that's
still pretty open,

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.840
but I've worked on a lot.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.400
Dynamic optimality.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.850
Central question here is, is
there one binary search tree

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.310
that's at least as good as
all other binary search trees?

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.580
Is there one binary search
tree to rule them all?

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.230
It's kind of a
fundamental question.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.980
Goes back to the '80s.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.580
In particular splay trees, which
you have probably seen before.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.080
We'll review them briefly here.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.820
And there's a lot of
technology built up,

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.670
which we'll talk about this
lecture and next lecture,

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.050
about how to tackle
this problem.

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.310
It's still active
area of research.

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:06.580
So before I get to-- well
the central question here is,

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:13.500
is there one best
binary search tree?

00:01:16.634 --> 00:01:19.050
It's a natural question because
we use binary search trees

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.591
all the time.

00:01:19.591 --> 00:01:21.510
Already in this class,
probably every lecture,

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.190
we've used a binary
search tree for something.

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:30.880
And we all know how to do order
log in balanced binary search

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:31.380
trees.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.940
And the question becomes,
is this the best you can do?

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:59.260
To make this more formal
of a problem, well, yeah.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:05.340
I want to define binary search
tree as a model of computation.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.640
OK we've talked about
pointer machine model.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.930
Binary search tree model is
a more restricted version

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:11.980
of pointer machine.

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.920
So it's less than
pointer machine.

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.940
Just so it's clear what
the name of this game is,

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:30.820
we require the data to be
stored in a binary search

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.525
tree as it's keys.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.550
And then we allow
basic operations.

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.910
Let me make sure I
get the right list.

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.930
You can follow
pointers, and we're

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.140
going to assume our BST
has left triad pointers,

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.270
right triad pointers,
and parent pointers.

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.370
You can do each of
these in constant time.

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.850
And then the interesting one,
interesting thing you can do,

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.210
is rotate a node and its parent.

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.960
So sure you've seen
rotations before.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.410
If this is my node
x, and I do rotate

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:43.070
x, it's going to be my
definition of rotation,

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:44.840
x moves to the root.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.770
It's in this case because x
is to the right of it's parent

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:51.870
it remains now to the
right of it's, what

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:52.940
now becomes it's child.

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.250
These sub-trees come
along for the ride.

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.280
This preserves the binary
search tree property.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.564
And you could get
back by rotating y.

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.547
OK by this definition
of rotate we

00:04:08.547 --> 00:04:10.130
don't need to
distinguish between left

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.230
and right rotations.

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.490
We always name the child and
it's parent is well defined.

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:17.190
That's who we rotate with.

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.010
So it's just flipping this edge.

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.120
So these are the operations
you can do, and in this model

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.190
really the only thing
you can do is a search.

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.650
Suppose I want to
search for a key.

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:38.300
The model is to do a search I
start at the root of the tree,

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:39.620
of the binary search tree.

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:40.670
I can do these walks.

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:42.500
I could do rotations.

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.930
And I must visit--

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:55.970
if I'm going to search for x,
must visit the node with key

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.160
equal to x.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.290
And we're going to assume
throughout these lectures

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:01.850
that searches are
always successful.

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:04.557
You're only searching for
keys that are in the tree.

00:05:04.557 --> 00:05:06.140
Doesn't make that
much of a difference

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:08.000
if you're searching for keys
that are not in the tree.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.880
Think of it as searching for the
predecessor or the successor.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.146
Not a big deal.

00:05:12.146 --> 00:05:13.520
And so for
simplicity, we're just

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.820
going to assume
successful searches.

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:19.790
We're also going to assume
no insertions and deletions

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:24.020
in this model, because they just
make problem a little messier.

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.690
Some papers have considered
insertions and deletions,

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:28.670
and to the large extent
things just work.

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:31.150
So, we're going to
focus on searches.

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.740
Searches is interesting
enough for this problem.

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.380
Suppose I have n items.

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:37.730
Now the model is clear.

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:40.067
I store them in a
binary search tree.

00:05:40.067 --> 00:05:41.900
These are the only
things I'm allowed to do.

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:50.630
Could I imagine beating log n?

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:54.860
Well, no in the worst case.

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.630
This is best possible
in the worst case.

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:04.310
Why?

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:06.850
Because your tree has
to have depth at least

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:10.550
log n if you're going to store
n things, and if it's binary.

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:12.895
So your adversary could
always be, could always just

00:06:12.895 --> 00:06:14.270
look at your tree
and say, Oh I'm

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:18.214
going to pick anybody who's
a log in depth or lower,

00:06:18.214 --> 00:06:19.880
and if you're going
to start at the root

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:21.447
and walk left and
right to get there,

00:06:21.447 --> 00:06:23.030
you're going to have
to pay log n time

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:27.010
every single, every
single operation.

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:29.010
So actually there's a lot
of sequences, in fact,

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:29.635
most sequences.

00:06:29.635 --> 00:06:32.870
You take an average sequence,
this will be the case.

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:36.840
But we'll see formal ways
to prove that next class.

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:38.720
But, easy adversary
argument tells you

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:42.210
you need to go down,
log n in the worst case.

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:48.180
But, that's the worst case.

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:50.150
The name of the game
in dynamic optimality

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:53.660
is to consider every case
separately, and do as

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:55.070
well as you can all the time.

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:58.190
In general, the answer
to this question is that,

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:00.350
is log n best possible?

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:03.519
Depends on the access sequence.

00:07:03.519 --> 00:07:05.060
Depends on what
you're searching for.

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:23.310
So, let's say we're, to
make things a little clean,

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:26.640
let's assume that the
key is we're storing are

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:30.132
the numbers,
integers, one up to n.

00:07:30.132 --> 00:07:31.590
So in particular
there's n of them.

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:33.630
And really we just
care about their order,

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:37.080
so I'm going to relabel
them to be one up to n.

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:46.620
And say we search for x 1
first, then we search for x 2,

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:51.060
and so on, up to x m.

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:54.300
So, these indices
are time, basically.

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:57.350
Over time, and you can
plot this if you like.

00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:59.900
Here is time.

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:02.440
Here is space.

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:07.830
So at the first time
unit we search at x 1,

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:11.100
then some other place,
then some other place.

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:15.590
We can have repeats, whatever.

00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:16.380
OK.

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:19.440
Some search sequences
are going to be slow,

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.630
they're going to require
log n time per access.

00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:23.970
In particular, if I always,
if the adversary chooses

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:27.180
x i to be the deepest node
in the tree repeatedly.

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:29.475
But some search sequences
are going to be fast.

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:37.049
Any suggestions, if you don't
have the notes in front of you,

00:08:37.049 --> 00:08:42.344
of access sequences that we
can do in less than log n

00:08:42.344 --> 00:08:43.135
time per operation.

00:08:43.135 --> 00:08:46.150
Let's A constant.

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:48.410
There's a lot of possible
answers, I think.

00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:55.210
Yeah?

00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:57.170
AUDIENCE: N divided by two.

00:08:57.170 --> 00:08:59.180
PROFESSOR: N divided by two.

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:01.070
What do you mean.

00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:04.939
AUDIENCE: Like it's
going to be [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:04.939 --> 00:09:06.980
PROFESSOR: Oh, if you're
searching for the median

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:08.680
in a perfectly balanced tree?

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:10.959
Yeah, that's true.

00:09:10.959 --> 00:09:13.250
So if you're always searching
for the root of the tree,

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:17.120
in particular, that's
going to be good.

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:19.430
That's hard to, that
depends on the tree though.

00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:21.710
I'd like a particular
access sequence

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:27.450
that I can always serve
as well, with some tree.

00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:28.830
AUDIENCE: n order walk.

00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:29.840
PROFESSOR: n order walk.

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:31.620
Yeah, good.

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:37.440
So this has a name.

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:38.850
Sequential access property.

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:51.200
If you want to access the
elements in order, so one

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:56.520
through n, this should only
cost constant amortized.

00:10:02.737 --> 00:10:04.570
Because for any tree
you can do and in order

00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:06.220
walk in linear time.

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:10.690
And so per search, if you're
careful about how you do this,

00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:14.860
now this is not totally obvious
in the model that I've set up,

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:17.690
because I said search
always starts at the root.

00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:20.260
If you let your search
start where you left off,

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.570
then you can definitely do this.

00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:24.760
It turns out you can
assume this or not,

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:26.350
it doesn't make a difference.

00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:27.607
That's maybe a fun exercise.

00:10:27.607 --> 00:10:29.440
But if, you can essentially
reroute the tree

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:31.842
to be wherever you left off.

00:10:31.842 --> 00:10:34.250
I'm not going to
prove that here.

00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:38.920
OK, but in particular, some
trees have this property.

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:39.610
Some don't.

00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:42.068
I mean if you use a red black
tree, and you search for one,

00:10:42.068 --> 00:10:43.780
then search for two,
then search for n,

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:45.610
you're not going to
get constant amortized,

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:47.750
because it doesn't
realize this is happening.

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:51.616
But if you're clever, of
course, this can be achieved.

00:10:51.616 --> 00:10:52.990
Easy way to see
how to achieve it

00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:57.500
is, this is your
binary search tree.

00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:00.160
You access one, then
you do a rotation

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:01.920
with the right child of one.

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:05.350
So then you have this
binary search tree,

00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:09.970
and then you access two,
and then you do a rotation.

00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:14.710
This is basically a
way to make a deck.

00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:18.880
View a, use a link, simulate a
linked list in a binary search

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:20.260
tree.

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:24.860
OK, so it definitely can be
done by some binary search tree.

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:28.305
A stronger version of the
sequential access property,

00:11:28.305 --> 00:11:32.800
it's a little more interesting,
is dynamic finger property.

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:35.740
This is something that should
hold for every access sequence,

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:38.200
and it gives you a measure
of how expensive an access

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:39.820
sequence is.

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:43.240
So we're doing x
one x two up to x m.

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:50.350
And we say, if we
measure the key distance

00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:53.770
between our current access,
x i and the previous access,

00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:55.290
x i minus 1.

00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:59.500
If that equals k,
then ideally we

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:03.670
should be able to do log
k amortize per operation.

00:12:06.184 --> 00:12:07.600
So in the worst
case this is going

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:12.940
to be log n, but if I look
at my space-time diagram

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:17.950
here, if for example, if
I do sequential access,

00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:21.850
then this number is always one,
and so I get constant time.

00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:26.920
If I do something like this,
where my spatial distance is

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:28.930
not changing too much,
and this is the reason

00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:31.060
I numbered the keys like this.

00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:33.700
What I really mean is, in
the sorted order of the keys,

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:35.410
how do the ranks differ.

00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:37.720
But if I number the
keys one through n,

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:40.589
that's just their
absolute difference.

00:12:40.589 --> 00:12:42.130
So anything like
this, dynamic finger

00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:45.874
properly tells you
you're doing well.

00:12:45.874 --> 00:12:48.290
Dynamic finger property can
be achieved by a binary search

00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:51.540
tree, but it's quite difficult
as you might imagine.

00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:56.400
Or it's difficult, let's say
not necessarily super hard.

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:58.980
If you don't need to do it in
a binary search tree model,

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:01.290
an easy way to do
it is with what's

00:13:01.290 --> 00:13:02.490
called a level linked tree.

00:13:04.849 --> 00:13:06.390
So a level link tree
looks like this,

00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:08.940
and I add pointers
between adjacent nodes

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:10.282
in the same level.

00:13:10.282 --> 00:13:11.990
This is a pointer
machine data structure,

00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:14.340
it's not a binary search
tree, because binary search

00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:18.120
trees we only allowed to do walk
left, walk right, walk parent,

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:20.470
But it's an easy way
to do dynamic finger.

00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:23.400
You start from
somewhere, you basically

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:27.630
walk up to the right level,
move over, walk back down,

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:33.840
and you can do a search for x
i from x i minus one relatively

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:34.470
quickly.

00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:36.720
It turns out this can be
stimulated by a binary search

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:38.970
tree, but we won't
go into it here.

00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:42.040
Lots of fun puzzles here.

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:50.190
Let's move on to some
more bounds or properties.

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:01.890
So, next property is called
the entropy property,

00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:04.010
or entropy bound.

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:17.310
And it says if key k appears
p sub k fraction of the time,

00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:26.640
then I'd like to achieve
a bound of entropy p

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:31.290
k log one over p
k per operation.

00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:34.072
This is, everything here
today will be amortized.

00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:39.905
So, if you haven't seen
entropy, that's the definition.

00:14:39.905 --> 00:14:41.970
It's the entropy of
this distribution.

00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:44.040
We're thinking of
these as probabilities,

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:46.870
although they're not
really probabilities.

00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:51.150
They're, because this is
over a particular sample.

00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:54.670
We have this sequence x1 to x
n, There's no randomness here,

00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:56.610
but we just measure
what is the fraction,

00:14:56.610 --> 00:14:59.380
what is sort of the observed
probability for each of these x

00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:00.210
i's.

00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:03.120
And then just say,
what is the, what

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:04.620
is the entropy of
that distribution?

00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:06.870
In the worst case
it's log n, if say

00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:09.640
everybody's equally likely,
everyone's accessed once,

00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:11.730
or the same number of times.

00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:14.130
But if it's highly
skewed, like if only one

00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:16.479
element is accessed, the
entropy will be constant.

00:15:16.479 --> 00:15:18.270
If a small number of
elements are accessed,

00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:19.311
entropy will be constant.

00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:24.090
So this can be
achieved, and in fact,

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:27.270
if you disallow
rotations, so if I change

00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:29.700
the model to forbid
rotations, all I get to do

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:31.740
is set up some
binary search tree,

00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:34.460
and then I have to walk left,
walk right, walk parent,

00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:37.680
from in that binary
search tree to do this.

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:39.900
So if I get to
see the x i's then

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:43.020
I get to build a
binary search tree.

00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:45.210
One binary search tree.

00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:47.160
This is what's called
the static optimal, when

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:50.310
you're not allowed to change the
tree as you're doing searches.

00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:52.730
Entropy is the best
bound you can get.

00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:57.990
And roughly speaking, key k
appears at height, or depth,

00:15:57.990 --> 00:16:01.470
log one over p k in the
tree, maybe plus one.

00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:06.480
And you can show there's always
a tree where every node ends up

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:08.580
at depth log one over p k.

00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:13.470
Again, not hard, but
we won't do it here.

00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:19.030
OK, a related property,
it's called the working set

00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:19.530
property.

00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:30.120
Little bit harder to state.

00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:06.290
For each search we
do x i, we're going

00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:10.970
to see when that's some key,
when was the last time that key

00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:12.180
was accessed.

00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:19.215
So, in our space-time diagram
we have some access at time i,

00:17:19.215 --> 00:17:21.980
we want to look backwards
in time to the last time

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:24.319
that key was accessed.

00:17:24.319 --> 00:17:30.860
Say that was, well some other
time j, and in this interval

00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:36.560
we want to know, how many
distinct keys were accessed.

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:41.060
So it's at most, i
minus j, but maybe there

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:44.340
were some repeated accesses,
we only count those as one.

00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:46.970
So how many different
keys were accessed

00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:48.500
during that time interval?

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:52.260
Claim is, we only have
to pay log of that.

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:54.880
So what this means, what this
implies, is in particular,

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:59.690
if you're only accessing say
k different elements at all,

00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:01.380
and you ignore all
the other elements,

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:03.867
then you'll only pay
log k per operation.

00:18:03.867 --> 00:18:05.450
That's why it's sort
of a working set.

00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:06.825
If you're focusing
your attention

00:18:06.825 --> 00:18:10.430
on k elements for a
while, you only pay log k.

00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:12.860
But in general, for any access
sequence you can compute,

00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:14.360
what is the working
set costs, which

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:17.540
is you sum over all
the i's of log t i,

00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:19.940
that is your total cost
for the access sequence.

00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:23.470
Divide by n, that's
the amortized cost.

00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:24.920
OK?

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:26.390
That's another
nice property, not

00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:30.240
so obvious is that working
set implies the entropy bound,

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:33.350
so this is a stronger property.

00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:36.800
I guess dynamic finger
implies sequential access,

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:40.950
but there's no relation between
working set and dynamic finger.

00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:43.760
In fact, they're kind of
transposes of each other.

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:46.030
Working set is
about, if you access

00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:49.520
a key that was accessed
recently, then it's fast.

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:51.470
Dynamic finger is
saying, if you access

00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:56.330
a key that is close in space
to the previous access,

00:18:56.330 --> 00:18:59.240
so here we're looking
at a key and basically

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:01.880
in the very previous
time step we're

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:04.400
looking at how far
away it was vertically,

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:07.100
here we're looking at how
far away it was horizontally.

00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:09.680
So they're almost
duals of each other.

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:12.200
Be nice if you could
have one property that

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:15.710
included both dynamic
finger and working set.

00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:17.810
I should mention, again
this is not obvious

00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:19.700
how to do it with a
binary search tree,

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:21.570
but it can be done.

00:19:21.570 --> 00:19:22.840
Leave it at that.

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:25.220
We'll see eventually
some trees that have it.

00:19:28.586 --> 00:19:29.960
For now I just
want to cover what

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:32.940
are the conceivable
goals we should aim for.

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:36.230
All right, log n is too easy, so
we need more challenging goals.

00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:41.870
So the next property,
it was introduced,

00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:48.710
this is we're getting into
more recent territory, 2001,

00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:50.870
it's called the
unified property.

00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:54.770
Natural name, and it tries
to unify dynamic finger

00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:57.560
with working set.

00:19:57.560 --> 00:19:59.330
And the rough idea
is, that if you

00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:02.630
access a key that
is close in space

00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:05.300
to a key that was
accessed recently in time,

00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:08.010
then your access should be fast.

00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:11.225
So, here's the formal statement.

00:20:56.790 --> 00:21:00.210
So here's the unified bound.

00:21:00.210 --> 00:21:03.060
Let's draw a picture.

00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:11.740
So here we're accessing
x i at time i, sorry j.

00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:14.430
Change of notation.

00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:14.930
Time j.

00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:18.260
We want to evaluate
the cost of x j,

00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:22.840
and we're basically
going to look in--

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:26.750
I guess one way to think
of it is this cone.

00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:31.010
90 degree cone, where
these are 45 degree angles.

00:21:31.010 --> 00:21:33.590
And if there's something--

00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:37.310
and look at the first thing
that you hit in that cone.

00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:38.960
Is that the right
way to think of it?

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:41.150
Maybe not.

00:21:41.150 --> 00:21:44.810
It's like you're growing a box,
this is probably more accurate,

00:21:44.810 --> 00:21:47.012
and you find the first key
that you hit in that box.

00:21:47.012 --> 00:21:48.470
It's a little more
subtle than that

00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:50.980
because we're only
counting distinct keys,

00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:55.130
and let's say you find this
key, and this key is good

00:21:55.130 --> 00:22:03.470
because it's temporal distance,
this time, is only this big.

00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:05.600
It's spatial distance
is only this big.

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:08.600
What we're going to
pay is, log of the sum

00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:11.996
of the spatial distance,
and the temporal distance.

00:22:11.996 --> 00:22:13.370
And temporal
distance is measured

00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:16.640
as the number of distinct keys
accessed in this time interval.

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:23.810
So, as long as there is some
key in the recent past that

00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:28.040
is close in space, you take
the min over all such keys,

00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:29.810
magically a unified
structure has

00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:33.050
to find what is the
most recent close item

00:22:33.050 --> 00:22:35.860
and search from there,
and achieve log of that.

00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:38.960
There's a plus 2 just to make
sure if these things are zero,

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:41.180
you still get a constant.

00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:44.390
Always have to
pay constant time.

00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:46.970
OK, so that's a
unified property.

00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:51.380
Fairly natural generalization of
dynamic finger and working set.

00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:54.270
I mean you could change this
plus to a product or a max,

00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:55.727
doesn't make a difference.

00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:00.380
Yeah.

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:01.760
Sadly we don't
know whether there

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:05.720
is any binary search tree that
achieves the unified property.

00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:09.020
What we know is that
this can be done,

00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:15.140
this property can be achieved
by a pointer machine data

00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:18.001
structure, which is more
powerful than a binary search

00:23:18.001 --> 00:23:18.500
tree.

00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:29.060
But we don't know whether
it's possible to achieve

00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:32.390
by a binary search tree.

00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:36.470
Best bound so far, is
that you can achieve

00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:39.170
this bound plus log log n.

00:23:39.170 --> 00:23:41.725
So as long as this
never gets too small,

00:23:41.725 --> 00:23:44.430
as long as this quantity
never gets smaller than log n,

00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:47.066
then this thing will be
log log n, and it's fine.

00:23:47.066 --> 00:23:48.690
But in particular,
if this is constant,

00:23:48.690 --> 00:23:51.670
then it's only achieving
log log n, so it's not--

00:23:51.670 --> 00:23:55.230
there's an additive log
log n per operation loss.

00:23:55.230 --> 00:23:57.430
That's the best binary
search, unified binary search

00:23:57.430 --> 00:23:57.929
tree known.

00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:04.090
OK, so this is all good.

00:24:04.090 --> 00:24:08.030
And this is sort of where the,
what we call analytic bounds,

00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:10.610
here ends.

00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:12.002
There are various attempts to--

00:24:12.002 --> 00:24:13.460
in general we want
to characterize,

00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:17.720
what is the optimal
thing we could hope for.

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:19.640
When can we do
better than log n?

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:21.140
These are all
specific cases where

00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:22.848
we can do better than
log n, but it's not

00:24:22.848 --> 00:24:24.520
a complete characterization.

00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:27.410
There are sequences that
have large unified bound,

00:24:27.410 --> 00:24:29.165
but have no--

00:24:31.730 --> 00:24:33.740
yet they can be
accessed more quickly

00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:35.624
by the optimal
binary search tree.

00:24:35.624 --> 00:24:37.540
And so, while it would
be nice to characterize

00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:41.780
with some clean algebraic,
whatever, most of the work,

00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:43.970
beyond what I've
told you about here,

00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:46.400
is just trying to
figure out what opt is.

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:50.259
Instead of trying to write
it down, try to compute it.

00:24:50.259 --> 00:24:51.800
Instead of trying
to define something

00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:53.690
that happens to
match the optimal,

00:24:53.690 --> 00:24:56.100
let's just go for optimal.

00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:58.433
And this is the notion
of dynamic optimality.

00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:04.090
And in modern
terminology this would

00:25:04.090 --> 00:25:09.860
be called constant
competitive, but the paper then

00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:13.145
introduced dynamic optimality
preceded competitive analysis,

00:25:13.145 --> 00:25:15.980
so it has another name.

00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:19.550
What we'd like, is that
the total cost of all

00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:22.530
your accesses, so this
is like amortized cost,

00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:26.920
is within a constant
factor of the optimal.

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:29.240
What's the optimal?

00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:33.080
This is the-- over all
binary search trees,

00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:35.720
I mean to be precise I should
talk about binary search tree

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:39.500
algorithms, meaning you specify
somehow how to do a search,

00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:41.900
and it may involve
rotations and walks.

00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:44.510
So, you know, it could
be red black tree,

00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:46.700
it could be an AVL tree,
could be a [? BB ?] alpha

00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:49.640
tree, anything that can be
implemented in this way.

00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:52.330
Those are all kind of boring.

00:25:52.330 --> 00:25:55.850
More sophisticated is
something like a splay tree.

00:25:55.850 --> 00:25:59.915
Ideally, you take
the min over all--

00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:06.710
min over all binary
search tree algorithms.

00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:13.820
The cost of that algorithm, on
that access sequence x, and you

00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:15.740
want the total cost
of your algorithm

00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:19.760
on x to be within a constant
factor of the optimal algorithm

00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:20.780
on x.

00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:23.610
x is a vector.

00:26:23.610 --> 00:26:26.540
So this is what you call
the offline optimal,

00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:29.600
because here you basically get
to choose the binary search

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:33.800
tree algorithm to
be customized to x,

00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:40.310
and yet somehow you want to
achieve dynamic optimality.

00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:43.970
Open question, is this possible?

00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:57.330
And, of course, we're only
interested in online solutions.

00:26:57.330 --> 00:26:59.432
So, you want to build a
binary search tree that

00:26:59.432 --> 00:27:00.890
doesn't know the
future, it doesn't

00:27:00.890 --> 00:27:02.750
know what accesses
are to come, but it

00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:06.020
has to be within a constant
factor of the offline solution

00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:07.928
that does know.

00:27:07.928 --> 00:27:10.160
And we don't know
whether this is possible.

00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:12.530
Another interesting
question, is whether it's

00:27:12.530 --> 00:27:17.634
possible for a pointer
machine, because save

00:27:17.634 --> 00:27:19.550
for the unified property
we know how to get it

00:27:19.550 --> 00:27:21.980
for a pointer machine.

00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:23.730
And there's two versions
of this question.

00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:25.970
You can consider, is
there a pointer machine

00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:28.096
that matches the optimal
binary search tree,

00:27:28.096 --> 00:27:30.470
or you could ask, is there a
pointer machine that matches

00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:31.779
the optimal pointer machine.

00:27:31.779 --> 00:27:34.070
That's a little less defined,
although there are some--

00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:36.528
I have some ideas on how to
define that problem, maybe will

00:27:36.528 --> 00:27:37.460
work on it.

00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:41.360
But all versions of this
problem are open, basically.

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:43.580
So, this may seem
rather depressing.

00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:46.472
What else am I going to do
for a lecture and a half?

00:27:46.472 --> 00:27:48.680
But actually, there's a lot
of study of this problem,

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:50.013
and we do know some good things.

00:27:50.013 --> 00:27:56.907
For example, we can get
log log n competitive.

00:28:00.890 --> 00:28:02.540
So, not within a
constant factor,

00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:06.480
but we can get within a log
log n factor of the optimal.

00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:07.785
So, that's pretty good.

00:28:07.785 --> 00:28:11.644
An easy result is to
get log n competitive.

00:28:11.644 --> 00:28:13.310
Any balanced binary
search tree is log n

00:28:13.310 --> 00:28:16.070
competitive, because best case
you could hope for is constant,

00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:18.160
the worst case you
can hope for is log n.

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:19.962
So at least within
the log factor,

00:28:19.962 --> 00:28:21.420
but we can do
exponentially better.

00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:24.560
We'll do that next class.

00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:31.820
Before we go there, I want to
tell you about two structures,

00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:36.110
to binary search trees that
we conjecture are dynamically

00:28:36.110 --> 00:28:38.030
optimal, but we can't prove it.

00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:03.890
So first one, and the classic
one, is splayed trees.

00:29:03.890 --> 00:29:06.790
I don't want to spend too
much time on splay trees,

00:29:06.790 --> 00:29:09.920
but just to let you know what
they are if you don't already

00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:11.270
know.

00:29:11.270 --> 00:29:14.900
If you want to search
for x, you search for x.

00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:17.750
You do a binary search
for x in the tree.

00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:19.930
You locate x, and then you--

00:29:19.930 --> 00:29:24.270
splay trees always
move x to the root.

00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:27.230
So, this is what we call
a self-adjusting tree.

00:29:27.230 --> 00:29:30.170
It changes the structure of
the tree as you do searches,

00:29:30.170 --> 00:29:34.160
not just when you're
doing updates,

00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:36.570
and there are two cases.

00:29:36.570 --> 00:29:39.200
If you look at x, and its
parent and its grandparent,

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:40.650
if they're oriented
the same way.

00:29:40.650 --> 00:29:44.180
So, here it's two left pointers,
could be two right pointers.

00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:46.850
Then you flip them.

00:29:46.850 --> 00:29:57.660
So we rotate y, and then rotate
x, so it's in this model.

00:29:57.660 --> 00:30:02.660
And we get x y z
in the other order.

00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:04.610
There's pretty much
only one way to move

00:30:04.610 --> 00:30:06.170
x to the root in that picture.

00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:17.255
Then the other case is
the zigzag case, y, w, x.

00:30:20.330 --> 00:30:22.890
So, here the two parent pointers
are in different directions,

00:30:22.890 --> 00:30:24.530
one is left, one is right.

00:30:24.530 --> 00:30:26.520
There's a symmetric picture.

00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:29.760
In this case, we rotate
in the other order.

00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:32.900
So, we rotate x, and
then we rotate y.

00:30:35.930 --> 00:30:44.465
And in that case you get x
nice, x, w, y, and the subtrees

00:30:44.465 --> 00:30:45.015
hang off.

00:30:45.015 --> 00:30:46.640
I'm not labeling the
subtrees, but they

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:50.940
have to be labeled in the
same order, left to right.

00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:52.130
OK, this is splay trees.

00:30:52.130 --> 00:30:56.360
You do this for x. x is
the thing you search for,

00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:58.460
now x is up here,
then you repeat.

00:30:58.460 --> 00:31:01.410
You look at it's two parents,
it's one of these two cases,

00:31:01.410 --> 00:31:03.650
you do the appropriate
two rotations.

00:31:03.650 --> 00:31:05.662
Until x is either the
root, and you're done,

00:31:05.662 --> 00:31:07.370
or it's one child from
the root, and then

00:31:07.370 --> 00:31:09.036
you do one rotation
to make it the root.

00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:14.120
Seems simple enough.

00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:17.290
It's slightly more sophisticated
than an algorithm known as move

00:31:17.290 --> 00:31:19.780
to root, which is just
rotate x, rotate x,

00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:22.450
rotate x, which would
eventually propagate it up.

00:31:22.450 --> 00:31:24.190
Move to root is a
really bad algorithm.

00:31:24.190 --> 00:31:26.770
It can show its can be a
factor of square root of n.

00:31:26.770 --> 00:31:30.760
It can be square root of n per
operation if you're unlucky.

00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:34.510
Splay trees are always, at most
log n amortized per operation,

00:31:34.510 --> 00:31:36.310
although that's
not at all obvious.

00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:39.670
Rough intuition, is if you
look at the path, the route

00:31:39.670 --> 00:31:44.740
to x path, half of the nodes,
at most half of the nodes

00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:47.650
go down when you splay.

00:31:47.650 --> 00:31:49.030
So why is that?

00:31:49.030 --> 00:31:52.250
Here, see y stays
at the same level.

00:31:52.250 --> 00:31:55.150
z goes down, but x goes up.

00:31:55.150 --> 00:32:00.710
Here, w stays at the same level,
x goes up, y goes down by one,

00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:04.060
x goes up by two, so you might
call that a net improvement.

00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:06.940
But in general you don't
mess up the path too much.

00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:09.320
Half the items stay
where they are,

00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:12.400
and so it's something
like your bisecting--

00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:14.155
if you repeatedly
search for x, well

00:32:14.155 --> 00:32:16.090
I'm not really searching
for x, but if you repeatedly

00:32:16.090 --> 00:32:17.673
search for things
in that path, you're

00:32:17.673 --> 00:32:19.550
kind of cutting the path
and half repeatedly.

00:32:19.550 --> 00:32:23.710
It'll look kind of logarithmic,
that's a very vague argument.

00:32:23.710 --> 00:32:25.930
And in the advanced
algorithms, it's

00:32:25.930 --> 00:32:27.790
proved why this is
log n amortized.

00:32:27.790 --> 00:32:28.707
Question?

00:32:28.707 --> 00:32:35.180
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:38.350
PROFESSOR: Rotate x, rotate
x, I think you're right.

00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:42.390
Yeah, y would go
somewhere else, thanks.

00:32:42.390 --> 00:32:48.580
Yeah, so here it looks like
move to root, here it doesn't.

00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:52.430
Good, and there's lots of
things known about splay trees.

00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:56.580
So for example, they satisfy
the sequential access property.

00:32:56.580 --> 00:33:00.380
There's an entire paper,
combinatoric on 1985 Tarjan

00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:03.860
I believe, proving splay trees
have the sequential access

00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:04.460
property.

00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:08.120
Not at all obvious,
but it's true.

00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:10.040
They have the
working set property,

00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:12.400
and therefore they have
the entropy property.

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:14.154
That's in the original
splay tree paper.

00:33:14.154 --> 00:33:15.320
It's not that hard to prove.

00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:17.840
Once you prove log n, with
a little bit more effort

00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:19.550
you can prove the
working set property.

00:33:19.550 --> 00:33:21.890
We won't do it here.

00:33:21.890 --> 00:33:26.660
It's a cool amortization.

00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:29.690
Splay trees also have the
dynamic finger property.

00:33:29.690 --> 00:33:33.410
This is a series of two
papers, over 100 pages long.

00:33:33.410 --> 00:33:34.660
Very difficult to prove.

00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:36.620
In general, splay trees
are hard to work with,

00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:39.392
because it's hard to keep
track of what's going on.

00:33:39.392 --> 00:33:40.850
You can define
potential functions,

00:33:40.850 --> 00:33:43.070
and that will prove this,
and with a lot of effort

00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:44.480
it will prove this.

00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:46.430
We don't know whether
splay trees satisfy

00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:48.364
the unified property,
and more to the point,

00:33:48.364 --> 00:33:50.780
we don't know whether splay
trees are dynamically optimal.

00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:53.900
This is the big question, and
in the original splay tree paper

00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:56.210
it asked this question,
are splay trees

00:33:56.210 --> 00:33:57.590
dynamically optimal.

00:33:57.590 --> 00:34:01.700
Still open, I wish I knew
the answer, but we don't.

00:34:05.390 --> 00:34:08.139
So what the rest of today's
lecture is going to be about

00:34:08.139 --> 00:34:12.747
is a geometric view, which
I've kind of been hinting

00:34:12.747 --> 00:34:14.830
at with this picture, but
it's, there's more to it

00:34:14.830 --> 00:34:18.580
than just plot the
points of searches.

00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:21.159
There's a way, not only to
see what the searches are,

00:34:21.159 --> 00:34:24.902
but to see what the binary
search tree algorithm is.

00:34:24.902 --> 00:34:26.860
So, at this point binary
search tree algorithms

00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:28.090
are kind of abstract.

00:34:28.090 --> 00:34:29.980
I mean, we've kind
of drawn pictures,

00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:31.810
and how to do
specific cases, you

00:34:31.810 --> 00:34:34.850
know how red black
trees or something work.

00:34:34.850 --> 00:34:36.790
But, you know, it's
complicated to write down

00:34:36.790 --> 00:34:37.789
one of these algorithms.

00:34:37.789 --> 00:34:41.050
How would we think
about all of them?

00:34:41.050 --> 00:34:43.120
What would you think
about the optimal one?

00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:45.940
Turns out there's a geometric
view, in which it's actually

00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:48.790
very easy to see what
the algorithm is,

00:34:48.790 --> 00:34:50.500
but it takes a
little bit of work

00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:52.750
to prove that it's
the right thing.

00:34:52.750 --> 00:34:57.820
And it suggests a totally
obvious offline optimal

00:34:57.820 --> 00:35:00.850
algorithm, which we
don't know is optimal,

00:35:00.850 --> 00:35:03.940
but we think is offline optimal.

00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:10.150
It's like the obvious thing
to do, which we'll get to,

00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:12.100
and we can actually
make it online.

00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:14.350
So, this is-- this
gives us a binary search

00:35:14.350 --> 00:35:17.110
tree that is so
obviously optimal,

00:35:17.110 --> 00:35:20.440
where splay trees is kind
of vaguely feels good,

00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:23.275
this is really obvious,
yet we can't prove it.

00:35:23.275 --> 00:35:26.710
So it's like we're one step
closer, but not quite there.

00:35:29.594 --> 00:35:30.760
So that's where we're going.

00:35:56.550 --> 00:35:59.250
So this geometric view was
the topic of [? Deion ?]

00:35:59.250 --> 00:36:01.740
[? Harmon's ?] PhD
thesis, here at MIT.

00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:04.717
And it's also with John Iacono,
[? Danielle ?] [? Caine, ?] who

00:36:04.717 --> 00:36:07.050
was an undergrad here, and
[? Mihal ?] [? Piotrowski, ?]

00:36:07.050 --> 00:36:09.450
who was an undergrad
and a PhD here.

00:36:09.450 --> 00:36:13.890
It was published
three years ago, 2009.

00:36:13.890 --> 00:36:17.130
So, here's the idea.

00:36:17.130 --> 00:36:21.780
Access sequence, this is the
sequence of searches you do.

00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:26.970
That's very easy, you just
map it to the set of points

00:36:26.970 --> 00:36:29.910
where, I guess I'm going
to switch things on you.

00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:33.030
Sorry about that.

00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:38.280
X-axis is going to be space,
y-axis is going to be time.

00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:40.470
And I'm going to look at a
specific example of this.

00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:47.150
Sort of pinwheel.

00:36:47.150 --> 00:36:49.820
Four accesses at--
the first time

00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:52.640
we access key three, then
we access key one, then

00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:54.680
key four, then key two.

00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:57.710
We've been drawing this
picture throughout the lecture.

00:36:57.710 --> 00:37:02.090
Now the interesting part, is
if you look at a binary search

00:37:02.090 --> 00:37:06.870
tree that actually
accesses these elements,

00:37:06.870 --> 00:37:08.900
here's the exciting part.

00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:14.360
We're going to map this
to a point set, which

00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:29.570
is which nodes get
touched during a search,

00:37:29.570 --> 00:37:30.800
during each search.

00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:40.530
OK, this is the fun part.

00:37:40.530 --> 00:37:41.730
So, what does touched mean?

00:37:41.730 --> 00:37:45.205
I erased the model, but in
general with a binary search

00:37:45.205 --> 00:37:47.080
tree, we only have one
pointer into the tree.

00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:49.890
It starts at the root, it
can go left, it can go right,

00:37:49.890 --> 00:37:51.570
it can go to the parent.

00:37:51.570 --> 00:37:53.820
Every node that gets
visited during-- it

00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:55.980
can do rotations,
every node that

00:37:55.980 --> 00:38:01.590
gets visited by walking, that's
what I call a touched node.

00:38:01.590 --> 00:38:03.070
Just look at all of them.

00:38:03.070 --> 00:38:05.175
So for example,
in this picture--

00:38:11.260 --> 00:38:14.920
color-- suppose,
maybe we're lucky,

00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:17.090
and key three is at the root.

00:38:17.090 --> 00:38:20.390
So that's the only
thing I touch.

00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:22.772
If that's the case,
when I access one,

00:38:22.772 --> 00:38:23.980
it's definitely not the root.

00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:29.310
So, in particular, I definitely
have to have touched that node.

00:38:29.310 --> 00:38:36.370
And I'm just going to fill
in a reasonable choice.

00:38:36.370 --> 00:38:40.310
I happen to know, this is
a valid binary search tree.

00:38:40.310 --> 00:38:42.910
Not so obvious, but
you can find one.

00:38:42.910 --> 00:38:45.320
I'm using here, the
greedy algorithm actually,

00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:46.690
I'm cheating.

00:38:46.690 --> 00:38:49.460
We'll get to what that is.

00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:52.060
But in general, some point
sets, like this point set,

00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:53.500
are not valid.

00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:56.020
There's no binary search tree
that has this touch pattern.

00:38:56.020 --> 00:38:57.790
You just can't jump
around, teleport,

00:38:57.790 --> 00:39:01.490
without getting somewhere.

00:39:01.490 --> 00:39:02.740
But, this one is valid.

00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:04.029
So, which ones are valid?

00:39:04.029 --> 00:39:05.320
Oh sorry I need one more point.

00:39:08.726 --> 00:39:10.600
Which ones are valid,
which ones are invalid?

00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:12.160
How did I know that
that was invalid,

00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:14.150
and now this one is valid?

00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:16.440
Well, there's a
theorem tell you.

00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:19.870
Then what I was just doing
there will become clear.

00:39:36.970 --> 00:39:41.940
So, I want to know when is
the point set a valid BST

00:39:41.940 --> 00:39:47.850
execution, and I claim
it is, if and only

00:39:47.850 --> 00:40:07.530
if, in every rectangle
spanned by two points

00:40:07.530 --> 00:40:26.160
not on a common horizontal
or vertical line,

00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:28.650
in every rectangle, there
there's another point.

00:40:37.710 --> 00:40:39.390
So, let me draw a picture.

00:40:39.390 --> 00:40:41.200
I have some point set.

00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:43.200
We'll look at this
one in a moment.

00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:44.940
In general, I take
any two points

00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:47.640
that are not horizontally
or vertically aligned,

00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:50.187
that spans a rectangle.

00:40:50.187 --> 00:40:52.020
In other words, the
rectangle with those two

00:40:52.020 --> 00:40:53.850
as opposite corners.

00:40:53.850 --> 00:40:56.082
There's got to be another
point in there, somewhere.

00:40:56.082 --> 00:40:57.915
Could be on the boundary,
could be interior.

00:41:00.490 --> 00:41:02.770
OK, in fact, you can
pump this a little bit.

00:41:02.770 --> 00:41:05.880
So once I find some point,
let's say on the interior,

00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:09.480
then my picture looks like this.

00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:12.970
Maybe I'll just
draw it as a circle.

00:41:12.970 --> 00:41:14.670
Well, here's another rectangle.

00:41:14.670 --> 00:41:16.500
That one has to have
a point inside it.

00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:18.090
Here's another
rectangle, that one

00:41:18.090 --> 00:41:20.410
has to have a point inside it.

00:41:20.410 --> 00:41:25.590
You could keep going, until you
know maybe I'd put one here,

00:41:25.590 --> 00:41:27.760
maybe I put one here.

00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:30.000
OK if I update the
picture then, I still

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:33.410
have a little
rectangle like that,

00:41:33.410 --> 00:41:36.600
little rectangle like that,
little rectangle like this.

00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:38.760
At this point, this point
is no longer involved

00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:41.749
in any rectangles
essentially, because there's

00:41:41.749 --> 00:41:43.290
no rectangle between
these two points

00:41:43.290 --> 00:41:45.480
because they're
horizontally aligned.

00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:50.490
I could finish this off,
finally, by adding points,

00:41:50.490 --> 00:41:52.350
let's say at the corners.

00:41:52.350 --> 00:41:55.860
Once I add points at the
corners this will be satisfied.

00:41:55.860 --> 00:41:59.715
We call this property
arborally satisfied.

00:41:59.715 --> 00:42:01.770
Gotta look up the spelling.

00:42:01.770 --> 00:42:06.420
Arboral satisfaction.

00:42:06.420 --> 00:42:10.170
Arboral means having
to do with a tree.

00:42:10.170 --> 00:42:13.560
OK, so this is saying that
point set is treelike,

00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:15.570
if it has this property.

00:42:15.570 --> 00:42:17.490
OK this picture is
getting a little messy,

00:42:17.490 --> 00:42:23.460
but if I have any monotone path,
like this, this is satisfied.

00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:27.420
If you look at any rectangle,
say this one, it has points--

00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:29.170
other points in it.

00:42:29.170 --> 00:42:31.580
OK, if I look at, I
don't know, this one,

00:42:31.580 --> 00:42:32.910
it has another point in it.

00:42:32.910 --> 00:42:35.493
But look at this one, that one
doesn't count because it's just

00:42:35.493 --> 00:42:36.420
a vertical line.

00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:39.055
So it has to have non-zero area.

00:42:39.055 --> 00:42:41.970
If you look at any two
points, this one and this one,

00:42:41.970 --> 00:42:44.340
they span a rectangle, there's
another point in there.

00:42:44.340 --> 00:42:46.030
So, monotone paths are good.

00:42:46.030 --> 00:42:47.040
This point set.

00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:50.900
If I drew it correctly, is good.

00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:54.480
I look at any rectangle here,
it's got another point in it.

00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:02.670
Takes some practice to be able
to see all the rectangles,

00:43:02.670 --> 00:43:04.134
but check it.

00:43:04.134 --> 00:43:05.300
Eventually this one is good.

00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:06.341
This one's obviously bad.

00:43:06.341 --> 00:43:08.940
It has lots of wrecked-- we
call these empty rectangles,

00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:12.480
unsatisfied rectangles, that
have no extra points in them.

00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:15.772
So, this is a valid BST
execution, this is not.

00:43:15.772 --> 00:43:17.980
Let's prove this theorem
it's actually not that hard.

00:43:31.470 --> 00:43:33.740
The consequence
of the theorem, is

00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:37.440
it tells us what we need to do.

00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:39.440
We are given a
point set like this,

00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:42.960
we want a point set like this.

00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:47.510
We can define the cost
of a binary search tree

00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:49.640
to be how many
nodes does it touch.

00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:52.890
That's within a constant factor
of how many operations you do.

00:43:52.890 --> 00:43:54.920
If you don't want to,
it's pointless to touch

00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:56.930
a node more than a
constant number of times.

00:43:56.930 --> 00:43:58.220
You can prove that.

00:43:58.220 --> 00:44:02.060
So, really we just care about
how many nodes get touched.

00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:05.360
So, what we want to do is find
a minimum superset of this point

00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:08.150
set that is satisfied.

00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:10.230
We're given a set to
represent or access

00:44:10.230 --> 00:44:12.042
sequence that is not satisfied.

00:44:12.042 --> 00:44:14.000
We need to act-- we need
to touch those points.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:16.400
That's the definition of search.

00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:19.010
And now we'd just like to also
touch some other points that

00:44:19.010 --> 00:44:19.760
make it satisfied.

00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:24.050
This is a geometric
interpretation of dynamic opt.

00:44:24.050 --> 00:44:27.152
Can you find the
offline optimal, is--

00:44:27.152 --> 00:44:28.610
what's the minimum
number of points

00:44:28.610 --> 00:44:33.560
to add in order to make your
point set arborally satisfied.

00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:35.600
We don't know whether
that problem is NP hard.

00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:37.400
Probably it is.

00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:40.069
We don't know how to compute it.

00:44:40.069 --> 00:44:41.860
We don't know how to
find a constant factor

00:44:41.860 --> 00:44:44.690
approximation, unfortunately.

00:44:44.690 --> 00:44:45.882
Yeah?

00:44:45.882 --> 00:44:50.450
AUDIENCE: So, this is for and
access sequence, so every time

00:44:50.450 --> 00:44:53.399
corresponds to just
seeking like one

00:44:53.399 --> 00:44:54.690
individually thing in the tree?

00:44:54.690 --> 00:44:55.410
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:44:55.410 --> 00:44:56.210
AUDIENCE: OK, that
makes more sense.

00:44:56.210 --> 00:44:58.080
PROFESSOR: Yes, so the input--

00:44:58.080 --> 00:45:01.370
there is a unique
thing, a key, that

00:45:01.370 --> 00:45:03.060
gets accessed at each time.

00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:07.250
So if you draw any horizontal
line, in the input point

00:45:07.250 --> 00:45:09.560
set there's only one point
in each horizontal line.

00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:12.680
There can be multiple points
in each vertical line, which

00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:15.436
would mean that key gets
accessed more than one time.

00:45:15.436 --> 00:45:17.060
That's the obvious
interpretation terms

00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:19.435
of binary search tree, turns
out you don't need to assume

00:45:19.435 --> 00:45:20.780
either of those things.

00:45:20.780 --> 00:45:22.790
You could allow a
sort of multi-search,

00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:26.870
where I say during this round
you have to access key 5 and 7,

00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:28.730
I don't care in what order.

00:45:28.730 --> 00:45:31.010
Whereas normally I say,
you have access key 5,

00:45:31.010 --> 00:45:32.544
then you have to access key 7.

00:45:32.544 --> 00:45:33.960
You could do a
multi-search, where

00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:36.920
there's multiple
points in a single row.

00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:39.260
All of the things I'll say
work, it doesn't really

00:45:39.260 --> 00:45:41.450
make a difference as the claim.

00:45:41.450 --> 00:45:45.740
You could also assume that no
key is accessed more than once,

00:45:45.740 --> 00:45:47.270
so then there's only one--

00:45:47.270 --> 00:45:48.860
those would be the
opposite extreme.

00:45:48.860 --> 00:45:51.809
You can assume there's
only one key per column.

00:45:51.809 --> 00:45:53.600
That turns out not to
make much difference.

00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:55.700
If there's multiple keys
in the same position,

00:45:55.700 --> 00:45:58.220
just spread them out
a little and you'll

00:45:58.220 --> 00:46:00.960
get roughly the same cost.

00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:02.186
So, good question.

00:46:02.186 --> 00:46:03.560
But in the natural
interpretation

00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:05.268
there's one per row,
multiple per column,

00:46:05.268 --> 00:46:06.980
but it doesn't,
neither one matters.

00:46:09.855 --> 00:46:10.355
OK.

00:46:14.210 --> 00:46:17.360
So this becomes the problem,
go from this to this,

00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:20.630
with a minimum number
of added points.

00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:24.130
We do know a log log n
approximation to that problem.

00:46:24.130 --> 00:46:26.540
That's the best we know.

00:46:26.540 --> 00:46:29.000
You just take this
binary search tree,

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:33.170
and apply this transformation,
and it tells you

00:46:33.170 --> 00:46:34.640
if you have a
binary search tree,

00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:37.022
you can turn it into a way
to satisfy a point set.

00:46:37.022 --> 00:46:39.230
But this is actually the
best approximation algorithm

00:46:39.230 --> 00:46:40.460
that we know.

00:46:40.460 --> 00:46:44.060
But as you'll see, the geometric
view offers a lot of insight.

00:46:44.060 --> 00:46:45.870
Gives us a lot of
power, and in some sense

00:46:45.870 --> 00:46:49.710
we use it to construct this.

00:46:49.710 --> 00:46:53.485
OK, so let's prove the theorem.

00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:02.660
So there's two directions.

00:47:02.660 --> 00:47:04.670
We'll start with
the easy direction.

00:47:04.670 --> 00:47:06.620
If you have a
binary search tree,

00:47:06.620 --> 00:47:09.404
then it must be
arborally satisfied.

00:47:09.404 --> 00:47:10.820
Then we'll have
to do the reverse,

00:47:10.820 --> 00:47:13.190
actually build a binary search
tree out of a point set.

00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:17.120
That's kind of the harder step.

00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:19.670
So, let's say we
have two points.

00:47:22.610 --> 00:47:27.860
Let's say this is that
time i, we access key x,

00:47:27.860 --> 00:47:31.610
and this one is at time
j, we access key y.

00:47:31.610 --> 00:47:33.340
Let's suppose y
is greater than x,

00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:35.990
there's the symmetric picture.

00:47:35.990 --> 00:47:38.270
We want to argue that
there is some other point

00:47:38.270 --> 00:47:42.010
in this rectangle.

00:47:42.010 --> 00:47:51.050
OK, here's the plan, let a be
the lowest common ancestor of x

00:47:51.050 --> 00:47:52.700
and y.

00:47:52.700 --> 00:47:57.110
x is a key, y is a key,
they are nodes in the tree.

00:47:57.110 --> 00:47:58.670
This is a changing quantity.

00:47:58.670 --> 00:48:01.050
As the tree wiggles
around those rotations,

00:48:01.050 --> 00:48:02.830
the least common
ancestor changes.

00:48:02.830 --> 00:48:05.911
But at every time,
there is, it has

00:48:05.911 --> 00:48:07.160
some of these common ancestor.

00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:10.250
Might be x, might be y,
might be some other node.

00:48:10.250 --> 00:48:11.840
OK?

00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:13.550
I want to look at
a couple of things.

00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:34.200
Let's say, right before
x is touched at time i,

00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:37.620
or I guess right before time i
would be the proper phrasing.

00:48:41.970 --> 00:48:47.250
So we're at this moment, I
want to know does a equal x?

00:48:51.730 --> 00:48:58.090
If a does not equal
x, then I'm going

00:48:58.090 --> 00:49:02.240
to use the point a comma i.

00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:02.800
OK?

00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:07.870
Least common ancestor has the
property that x is less than

00:49:07.870 --> 00:49:10.420
or equal to a, is less
than or equal to y.

00:49:10.420 --> 00:49:12.250
Common ancestor,
least common ancestor

00:49:12.250 --> 00:49:15.760
will be between x and y.

00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:17.870
And we also know that
it's an ancestor of x,

00:49:17.870 --> 00:49:19.030
and it's an ancestor of y.

00:49:19.030 --> 00:49:22.550
So, if you're going to
touch x, you must touch a.

00:49:22.550 --> 00:49:26.260
If you're going to touch
y, you must touch a.

00:49:26.260 --> 00:49:30.520
So a comma i is going to
be some point here, which

00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:32.410
is what we need.

00:49:32.410 --> 00:49:41.080
Except, if a equals x, sorry,
what the heck did I do?

00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:42.070
Transposed again.

00:49:42.070 --> 00:49:49.748
OK, this is time i, time
j, x, y, sorry about that.

00:49:49.748 --> 00:49:54.550
OK, here's time i, here is a.

00:49:54.550 --> 00:49:59.035
So, if a does not equal
x, we know at time i,

00:49:59.035 --> 00:50:00.910
we must access
all ancestor of x,

00:50:00.910 --> 00:50:04.030
we must touch all ancestors
of x, before we touch x.

00:50:04.030 --> 00:50:06.130
Therefore, this is
a point and we're

00:50:06.130 --> 00:50:09.295
done, unless a equals
x at this time,

00:50:09.295 --> 00:50:10.670
because then it's
the same point.

00:50:10.670 --> 00:50:12.336
We didn't get a third
point, we at least

00:50:12.336 --> 00:50:15.880
need to find some different
point other than these two.

00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:17.620
OK, so that would be good.

00:50:17.620 --> 00:50:23.140
We can-- so it must actually be
that at this time, at time i,

00:50:23.140 --> 00:50:25.450
a is right here.

00:50:25.450 --> 00:50:27.030
Let's then look at time j.

00:50:32.110 --> 00:50:36.370
Same deal, at time j,
here's y that gets access.

00:50:36.370 --> 00:50:38.620
We must also access a.

00:50:38.620 --> 00:50:41.740
Now it could be its equal to y,
or it could be somewhere else.

00:50:41.740 --> 00:50:45.250
It could be here, or
could be still here.

00:50:45.250 --> 00:50:48.730
In those cases we're
happy, but this one also

00:50:48.730 --> 00:50:51.190
could have been at the corner.

00:50:51.190 --> 00:50:57.700
The case we're not happy is when
b equals x, sorry, a equals y.

00:50:57.700 --> 00:51:00.310
Getting my letters mixed up.

00:51:00.310 --> 00:51:02.230
As long as a does
not equal y, then

00:51:02.230 --> 00:51:05.512
we can use the point a
comma j, that must be,

00:51:05.512 --> 00:51:06.970
these are always
in your execution,

00:51:06.970 --> 00:51:10.420
and if a does not equal y, then
we're, that's a third point

00:51:10.420 --> 00:51:13.130
and we're done.

00:51:13.130 --> 00:51:17.454
So we're left with one more
case, which is that at time i,

00:51:17.454 --> 00:51:25.450
a is here, here's a, and
at time j, a is here.

00:51:25.450 --> 00:51:28.720
Question is, what
happened in between?

00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:29.510
a changed.

00:51:32.130 --> 00:51:37.560
For a to change, something
in here has to get rotated.

00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:40.950
That's the [? clam. ?] I mean
here's the picture, you have a,

00:51:40.950 --> 00:51:46.890
actually-- picture is
at the beginning a is x.

00:51:46.890 --> 00:51:51.960
So, here we have x, and then
y is an ancestor, sorry,

00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:55.320
y is a descendant of
x, because this is a.

00:51:55.320 --> 00:51:57.150
And then somehow we
have to transition

00:51:57.150 --> 00:51:59.190
to the reverse picture,
which is that y is

00:51:59.190 --> 00:52:03.550
the least common ancestor, x.

00:52:03.550 --> 00:52:08.460
And for this to happen, somebody
here has to get rotated.

00:52:08.460 --> 00:52:10.500
I guess, in particular x.

00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:16.120
At some point x had to
overtake y, had to be moved up.

00:52:16.120 --> 00:52:19.170
So, at some point x was
rotated, and that would

00:52:19.170 --> 00:52:20.340
correspond to a point here.

00:52:23.030 --> 00:52:32.310
So else x must be
rotated at some time

00:52:32.310 --> 00:52:37.110
k, where k is between i and j.

00:52:47.710 --> 00:52:51.420
And if we set it up right, I
guess because here a was still

00:52:51.420 --> 00:53:00.340
x, and here a is y, then it
must be strictly between.

00:53:03.700 --> 00:53:06.250
Maybe like this would
be what we want.

00:53:09.110 --> 00:53:13.620
And so then we use
the point k comma x.

00:53:19.886 --> 00:53:21.050
Is that more or less clear?

00:53:24.522 --> 00:53:25.480
This was the easy case.

00:53:28.570 --> 00:53:30.790
I guess it depends
what you consider easy.

00:53:30.790 --> 00:53:33.980
Here we're just, we're
given a search tree

00:53:33.980 --> 00:53:38.810
and the short version is, look
at the least common ancestor.

00:53:38.810 --> 00:53:42.460
It's got to move around at
some point, or not, either way

00:53:42.460 --> 00:53:44.450
you're happy.

00:53:44.450 --> 00:53:46.420
So the least common
ancestor gives you

00:53:46.420 --> 00:53:48.650
the points you care about.

00:53:48.650 --> 00:53:51.820
So for that we just needed the
least common ancestor idea.

00:53:51.820 --> 00:53:53.470
For the other
direction, if we're

00:53:53.470 --> 00:53:55.270
given a point set
that corresponds

00:53:55.270 --> 00:53:58.510
to, that has this
satisfaction property,

00:53:58.510 --> 00:54:02.207
we have to somehow build from
scratch a binary search tree.

00:54:02.207 --> 00:54:04.540
How the heck are we going to
build a binary search tree?

00:54:04.540 --> 00:54:08.845
Well, with treaps.

00:54:37.370 --> 00:54:39.350
So, this is the other direction.

00:54:46.520 --> 00:54:52.356
Treap is a portmanteau
of tree and heap.

00:54:52.356 --> 00:54:56.180
Underline it
correctly, tree, heap.

00:54:56.180 --> 00:55:01.160
So, it's simultaneously a binary
search tree and a min heap,

00:55:01.160 --> 00:55:03.110
in this case.

00:55:03.110 --> 00:55:05.200
It's a binary search tree
because it has to be.

00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:07.790
It's a binary search
tree on the keys.

00:55:07.790 --> 00:55:12.170
It's going to be heap on
a different set of values.

00:55:12.170 --> 00:55:22.400
So, binary search tree on
the keys, and it's heap

00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:32.420
ordered, min heap
ordered, by next access.

00:55:35.625 --> 00:55:38.000
I didn't say I was going to
give you an online algorithm,

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:40.280
this is an offline algorithm.

00:55:40.280 --> 00:55:44.060
So it looks-- if
I look at a key,

00:55:44.060 --> 00:55:48.350
and it's going to be accessed
next, it better be at the root.

00:55:48.350 --> 00:55:50.730
Next access will
always be at the root,

00:55:50.730 --> 00:55:51.730
if you're heap ordered.

00:55:51.730 --> 00:55:54.050
If you're a min
heap by next access.

00:55:54.050 --> 00:55:56.150
This is great, that
means the thing you're

00:55:56.150 --> 00:55:57.650
searching for is
always at the root,

00:55:57.650 --> 00:56:00.860
and it's basically
free to touch.

00:56:00.860 --> 00:56:03.295
But you may choose
to touch other nodes.

00:56:03.295 --> 00:56:05.870
And in fact, we're told
how to touch notes.

00:56:05.870 --> 00:56:07.550
We're given a pattern
that says, well,

00:56:07.550 --> 00:56:10.820
at this time you have-- you
will touch this node, this node,

00:56:10.820 --> 00:56:12.650
and this node.

00:56:12.650 --> 00:56:16.437
By that definition, this
one will be at the root,

00:56:16.437 --> 00:56:18.020
but you're going to
touch these nodes,

00:56:18.020 --> 00:56:20.750
and possibly you
could rotate them.

00:56:20.750 --> 00:56:22.460
Change the tree.

00:56:22.460 --> 00:56:24.650
You'll have to, actually,
because next access

00:56:24.650 --> 00:56:26.510
time is constantly changing.

00:56:26.510 --> 00:56:28.490
And as soon as you
access an item,

00:56:28.490 --> 00:56:31.040
it's next access goes in
sometime in the future,

00:56:31.040 --> 00:56:34.010
possibly infinity, and so you'd
like to start pushing it down

00:56:34.010 --> 00:56:34.510
in the tree.

00:56:37.420 --> 00:56:39.420
So, what we need to
do is show that we

00:56:39.420 --> 00:56:41.920
can maintain-- it's always going
to be a binary search tree,

00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:43.600
because we only do rotations.

00:56:43.600 --> 00:56:46.480
We have to somehow use rotations
to maintain this heap order

00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:52.240
property, and only touch
the nodes that we're

00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:53.920
supposed to touch.

00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:57.380
That's the challenge.

00:56:57.380 --> 00:57:02.350
So, I should mention, this is
not a uniquely defined tree.

00:57:02.350 --> 00:57:05.440
Usually treaps are unique,
if you specify a key order,

00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:06.980
and you specify a
heap order, there

00:57:06.980 --> 00:57:10.840
is exactly one tree that
satisfies both of them.

00:57:10.840 --> 00:57:13.720
But here it's not quite
unique, because the next access

00:57:13.720 --> 00:57:17.210
time-- there are many keys that
are going, sorry, next touch.

00:57:20.770 --> 00:57:23.020
Next touch time.

00:57:23.020 --> 00:57:29.410
So, for example, at this
moment all three of these nodes

00:57:29.410 --> 00:57:32.610
are going to be accessed
at the same time.

00:57:32.610 --> 00:57:34.975
And so you don't
know, or I'm not

00:57:34.975 --> 00:57:37.600
specifying how they're supposed
to be heap ordered in the tree.

00:57:37.600 --> 00:57:41.270
Just break ties arbitrarily,
it doesn't matter.

00:57:41.270 --> 00:57:43.450
OK.

00:57:43.450 --> 00:57:53.800
So, let's look at a time i.

00:57:53.800 --> 00:57:57.670
When we reach that
time i, the nodes

00:57:57.670 --> 00:58:10.266
to touch form and connected
subtree containing the root.

00:58:13.620 --> 00:58:15.820
Because according to
heap order, they're all,

00:58:15.820 --> 00:58:17.530
they all want to be at the root.

00:58:17.530 --> 00:58:23.440
So we break ties arbitrarily,
somehow, you know all the nodes

00:58:23.440 --> 00:58:27.280
that we're supposed to touch,
live in some connected subtree

00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:30.300
of the root.

00:58:30.300 --> 00:58:34.870
Sorry, some connected
subtree containing the root.

00:58:34.870 --> 00:58:40.420
Everything down here has
a later next touch time,

00:58:40.420 --> 00:58:45.060
and so they're below, by
definition of heap order.

00:58:45.060 --> 00:58:47.729
OK, now one of these is the
one we actually want to access.

00:58:47.729 --> 00:58:50.020
But we need to touch all of
them, so touch all of them,

00:58:50.020 --> 00:58:50.811
you know, navigate.

00:58:50.811 --> 00:58:52.420
Walk left, right, whatever.

00:58:52.420 --> 00:58:55.360
The big question is, what
should we change this tree into?

00:58:55.360 --> 00:59:01.930
I'd like to change it to
some other top structure.

00:59:01.930 --> 00:59:03.520
I can't touch
anything down here,

00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:05.790
I'm only allowed to
touch these points.

00:59:05.790 --> 00:59:09.507
I only want to
rotate these somehow.

00:59:09.507 --> 00:59:11.590
There's a convenient
theorem, if you have one tree

00:59:11.590 --> 00:59:13.256
and you want to convert
it into another,

00:59:13.256 --> 00:59:15.970
you can always do it in a
linear number of rotations.

00:59:15.970 --> 00:59:18.130
So, rotations are basically
free and this model,

00:59:18.130 --> 00:59:20.650
it's just about how
many nodes we touch.

00:59:20.650 --> 00:59:22.270
We're told which nodes to touch.

00:59:22.270 --> 00:59:25.120
We want to somehow rearrange
them to restore this heap order

00:59:25.120 --> 00:59:26.030
property.

00:59:26.030 --> 00:59:26.530
Right?

00:59:26.530 --> 00:59:28.090
As soon as we touch
all these nodes,

00:59:28.090 --> 00:59:31.810
their next touch time will
be sometime in the future.

00:59:31.810 --> 00:59:34.700
We need to rearrange the
tree to still be heap ordered

00:59:34.700 --> 00:59:37.000
by that new next touch time.

00:59:39.600 --> 00:59:42.250
OK, here's what we do.

00:59:45.731 --> 00:59:47.230
I mean there's only
one thing to do.

00:59:49.870 --> 00:59:54.610
Rearrange those nodes in
this connected subtree

00:59:54.610 --> 01:00:04.240
to be a local treap by
the new next touch time.

01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:11.680
These are the only nodes to
get a new next touch time,

01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:15.970
so it's more or less unique
how to rearrange them.

01:00:15.970 --> 01:00:17.260
Do that.

01:00:17.260 --> 01:00:20.430
Now the hard part is to argue
that the whole thing is now

01:00:20.430 --> 01:00:20.930
a treap.

01:00:24.140 --> 01:00:29.210
Why was it enough to
only modify these nodes?

01:00:29.210 --> 01:00:32.510
Maybe you set one of these nodes
to have a very large next touch

01:00:32.510 --> 01:00:35.199
time, so it's got to be
really deep down there.

01:00:35.199 --> 01:00:37.740
And you can't afford to push it
down deep, because you're not

01:00:37.740 --> 01:00:40.200
allowed to touch
any of these nodes.

01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:44.370
Looks worrisome, but
turns out, it just works.

01:00:47.390 --> 01:00:55.350
So, if there were a failure,
picture would be like this.

01:00:55.350 --> 01:00:59.290
We rearrange these nodes
perfectly, in particular,

01:00:59.290 --> 01:01:01.720
let's look at some
node x that has a child

01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:03.900
y, that was not touched.

01:01:03.900 --> 01:01:06.690
So x was touched, all of
it's ancestors were touched,

01:01:06.690 --> 01:01:09.390
but y was not touched.

01:01:09.390 --> 01:01:12.867
So we know that the
next touch time of x

01:01:12.867 --> 01:01:15.450
is greater than or equal to the
next touch time of its parent,

01:01:15.450 --> 01:01:17.730
of it's ancestor,
up to the root.

01:01:17.730 --> 01:01:20.850
The worry would be that
the next touch time of x

01:01:20.850 --> 01:01:23.720
is greater than the
next touch time of y.

01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:38.802
So suppose next touch of x is
greater than next touch of y.

01:01:38.802 --> 01:01:41.385
This would be a problem, because
then you would not be a heap.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:02:17.850
So, claim is we get an
unsatisfied rectangle

01:02:17.850 --> 01:02:20.940
based on x and it's next touch
time, and y and it's next touch

01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:21.720
time.

01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:24.030
So let's draw the picture.

01:02:24.030 --> 01:02:30.540
Here's time, here's
space, I'm going

01:02:30.540 --> 01:02:34.950
to assume by symmetry x
is to the left of y and

01:02:34.950 --> 01:02:38.970
[? keyspace, ?] and
now we're supposing

01:02:38.970 --> 01:02:42.375
the next touch time of y is
earlier than the next touch

01:02:42.375 --> 01:02:43.050
time of x.

01:02:43.050 --> 01:02:45.820
So it looks like this.

01:02:45.820 --> 01:02:53.730
So this is next touch time of
x, this is the next time of y,

01:02:53.730 --> 01:03:00.041
and I claim that there are
no other points in here.

01:03:00.041 --> 01:03:02.040
That would be a contradiction,
because we assume

01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:03.240
that the thing is satisfied.

01:03:10.650 --> 01:03:16.350
To prove this, I need to go back
a little bit to the definition,

01:03:16.350 --> 01:03:16.890
over here.

01:03:20.955 --> 01:03:22.830
There are actually a
couple of different ways

01:03:22.830 --> 01:03:26.550
to think about satisfaction,
which I was getting at here,

01:03:26.550 --> 01:03:28.140
but I didn't solidify.

01:03:28.140 --> 01:03:29.820
So, I said OK, if
you have two points

01:03:29.820 --> 01:03:31.690
and that rectangle
is satisfied, there

01:03:31.690 --> 01:03:35.980
is some point, possibly in the
interior, in that rectangle.

01:03:35.980 --> 01:03:39.870
But if it's interior,
then I can keep going.

01:03:39.870 --> 01:03:45.840
If I keep going, in the end I
can conclude that not only is

01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:47.730
this rectangle
non-empty, but there

01:03:47.730 --> 01:03:52.880
has to be a point on
one of these two sides,

01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:54.867
because if I choose
any other point,

01:03:54.867 --> 01:03:55.950
I get a smaller rectangle.

01:03:55.950 --> 01:03:58.860
Eventually, I have to get one
on one of those two sides.

01:03:58.860 --> 01:04:01.242
Could be at the
corner, or this corner,

01:04:01.242 --> 01:04:03.450
but one of those two sides
has to have a point on it.

01:04:03.450 --> 01:04:06.789
Also, one of these two sides
has to have a point on it.

01:04:06.789 --> 01:04:08.330
It could be both of
these constraints

01:04:08.330 --> 01:04:12.300
are met at once by having
one point in the corner.

01:04:12.300 --> 01:04:14.760
Well that's a somewhat stronger
formulation, but equivalent

01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:18.120
formulation of the
satisfaction property.

01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:23.160
So in particular over
here, it should be the case

01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:26.100
that there's a point,
either here or here,

01:04:26.100 --> 01:04:28.410
and there should be a
point, either here or here.

01:04:28.410 --> 01:04:30.360
I claim that one of
those is violated.

01:04:45.649 --> 01:04:47.940
You think I'd know this stuff,
I wrote the paper, but--

01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:54.090
it's all these subtle
details, easy to get wrong.

01:04:54.090 --> 01:05:00.040
I think what I want
to look at is, now,

01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:03.580
which is the moment we're
drawing this diagram, versus

01:05:03.580 --> 01:05:06.010
the next time of y.

01:05:06.010 --> 01:05:09.100
Sorry, so this is x comma now.

01:05:11.354 --> 01:05:13.020
That's what my diagram
looks like there,

01:05:13.020 --> 01:05:15.070
so I think that's what I mean.

01:05:15.070 --> 01:05:16.150
So ignore this picture.

01:05:20.190 --> 01:05:23.830
What we learn, what we know
is the next access to x,

01:05:23.830 --> 01:05:25.194
is sometime in the future.

01:05:25.194 --> 01:05:26.360
That's what we're told here.

01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:30.460
Next touch of x is greater
than next touch of y.

01:05:30.460 --> 01:05:35.580
So next touch of x is up here,
which means this is empty.

01:05:35.580 --> 01:05:40.011
OK, if that's empty,
this better not be empty.

01:05:40.011 --> 01:05:42.010
All right that's what we
claim, one of these two

01:05:42.010 --> 01:05:44.830
has to have a point in it.

01:05:44.830 --> 01:05:47.440
This one's empty, so
this better not be empty,

01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:48.670
but I claim this is empty.

01:05:48.670 --> 01:05:53.401
Suppose it's not, suppose it
is, suppose it's not empty--

01:05:53.401 --> 01:05:56.460
Wait, no, one of these.

01:05:56.460 --> 01:06:00.850
Suppose it's not empty, should
be the correct scenario.

01:06:00.850 --> 01:06:03.460
Look at the left most
point in this range.

01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:10.725
This guy.

01:06:15.620 --> 01:06:19.620
It's a point between x and
y, in terms of key value.

01:06:19.620 --> 01:06:23.870
So, in this picture,
where could it be?

01:06:23.870 --> 01:06:29.470
Where are the points between
x and y in this diagram?

01:06:29.470 --> 01:06:31.861
They have to be in
the left subtree of y.

01:06:31.861 --> 01:06:32.360
Right?

01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:34.827
The only points in a binary
search-- if x and y are--

01:06:34.827 --> 01:06:37.160
if y is a child of x, the
only points in the binary tree

01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:40.640
that are between x and y,
or the left subtree of y,

01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:43.400
or there's a symmetric case,
but in this picture left subtree

01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:44.870
of y.

01:06:44.870 --> 01:06:45.970
But I put an x here.

01:06:45.970 --> 01:06:48.500
That means that whoever
we're looking at,

01:06:48.500 --> 01:06:52.760
some point between x and y,
has to be in this top tree.

01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:55.310
Contradiction, done, OK?

01:06:55.310 --> 01:06:58.130
If this guy is in there,
then y was also in there,

01:06:58.130 --> 01:07:01.554
which meant there
was a point here,

01:07:01.554 --> 01:07:03.470
and that's what we're
assuming did not happen.

01:07:03.470 --> 01:07:04.928
This is supposed
to be an interface

01:07:04.928 --> 01:07:07.550
between inside the
set of touched nodes,

01:07:07.550 --> 01:07:10.740
and outside the set
of touched nodes.

01:07:10.740 --> 01:07:14.090
So there can't be
any points in here,

01:07:14.090 --> 01:07:17.686
which means this is empty, which
means you weren't satisfied.

01:07:17.686 --> 01:07:19.310
OK, maybe I should
write down the words

01:07:19.310 --> 01:07:21.110
to go with that argument, but--

01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:34.770
So, this part is empty by
next touch of x being greater

01:07:34.770 --> 01:07:37.530
than next touch of y.

01:07:37.530 --> 01:07:45.180
And this part is empty
else, or it's empty

01:07:45.180 --> 01:08:03.960
because any key
between x and y is

01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:18.189
in the left subtree of
y, which would imply

01:08:18.189 --> 01:08:28.930
if it's touched then so is y.

01:08:28.930 --> 01:08:32.450
But y cannot be
touched, by assumption.

01:08:32.450 --> 01:08:34.960
So that's the end of that proof.

01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:38.137
A little bit longer,
but hopefully

01:08:38.137 --> 01:08:39.470
it's pretty clear at this point.

01:08:39.470 --> 01:08:40.778
Question?

01:08:40.778 --> 01:08:43.148
AUDIENCE: Can't
there be something

01:08:43.148 --> 01:08:45.810
like a descendent of x,
but an ancestor of y,

01:08:45.810 --> 01:08:49.034
instead of being in
a subtree with y?

01:08:49.034 --> 01:08:50.450
PROFESSOR: Would,
so you could say

01:08:50.450 --> 01:08:51.884
it could be in between here.

01:08:51.884 --> 01:08:54.050
It could be a descendant
of x, but an ancestor of y,

01:08:54.050 --> 01:08:56.810
but we're assuming here that
this was a child relation.

01:08:56.810 --> 01:08:58.310
y was a child of x.

01:08:58.310 --> 01:08:59.394
This was a--

01:08:59.394 --> 01:09:01.536
I didn't say that
at the beginning.

01:09:01.536 --> 01:09:03.410
On a claim that's a
global treap, if it's not

01:09:03.410 --> 01:09:06.710
a global treap, there is
some edge that's violated,

01:09:06.710 --> 01:09:08.340
that does not have
heap order property.

01:09:08.340 --> 01:09:11.180
So assuming this was
an edge, x is OK,

01:09:11.180 --> 01:09:13.609
it was in the local
treap, y somehow

01:09:13.609 --> 01:09:16.100
is going to be bad, because
it's next touch time was,

01:09:16.100 --> 01:09:16.970
should be higher.

01:09:16.970 --> 01:09:18.050
Should be above.

01:09:18.050 --> 01:09:19.008
Other question?

01:09:19.008 --> 01:09:21.000
AUDIENCE: So that
[INAUDIBLE] you drew,

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:25.980
and all the everything in that
subtree root that gets taken

01:09:25.980 --> 01:09:26.976
to--

01:09:26.976 --> 01:09:28.968
Like the picture on
the right is also,

01:09:28.968 --> 01:09:30.462
it's the same subtree right?

01:09:30.462 --> 01:09:32.479
But after you change
their [INAUDIBLE]

01:09:32.479 --> 01:09:34.340
PROFESSOR: These two subtrees
have the same set of nodes,

01:09:34.340 --> 01:09:35.756
they've just been
rotated somehow.

01:09:35.756 --> 01:09:38.926
AUDIENCE: OK, but then
how do you-- but didn't

01:09:38.926 --> 01:09:41.524
we change the next touch times
of all the nodes in there?

01:09:41.524 --> 01:09:43.472
So how you do know if
the root is still going

01:09:43.472 --> 01:09:45.420
to be some guy in that subtree?

01:09:48.850 --> 01:09:50.189
PROFESSOR: Buy this argument.

01:09:50.189 --> 01:09:53.340
So the question is
say, after we do this,

01:09:53.340 --> 01:09:55.860
we make some root,
which is going,

01:09:55.860 --> 01:09:58.110
the root is going to
be among all the nodes

01:09:58.110 --> 01:10:02.280
that just got touched now, who
is going to be touched next?

01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:03.720
That's who we put at the root.

01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:07.050
And the claim is, that
is globally the node that

01:10:07.050 --> 01:10:08.100
will be touched next.

01:10:08.100 --> 01:10:08.800
Why?

01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:11.220
By this argument.

01:10:11.220 --> 01:10:15.360
If there were some other node
down here that has a smaller

01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:18.655
next access time, then--

01:10:22.947 --> 01:10:24.780
but we know that it was
heap ordered before,

01:10:24.780 --> 01:10:26.500
so all of these guys
are heap ordered.

01:10:26.500 --> 01:10:28.680
So, this guy would
then have the minimum.

01:10:28.680 --> 01:10:30.150
And then we look
at that interface,

01:10:30.150 --> 01:10:32.900
and the claim is by the
satisfaction property,

01:10:32.900 --> 01:10:35.306
actually this point should
have been in the set.

01:10:35.306 --> 01:10:36.930
So, what this tells
you is the guy that

01:10:36.930 --> 01:10:38.970
has to be accessed
next, in particular,

01:10:38.970 --> 01:10:41.340
must be in your set.

01:10:41.340 --> 01:10:42.819
Must be touched now.

01:10:46.950 --> 01:10:48.810
Kind of magical.

01:10:48.810 --> 01:10:51.180
Well actually, it's because
they're tie-breaking

01:10:51.180 --> 01:10:53.690
I think, that this works out.

01:10:53.690 --> 01:10:55.454
Anyway, another question?

01:10:55.454 --> 01:10:59.406
AUDIENCE: So, like when you're
rearranging the [INAUDIBLE]

01:10:59.406 --> 01:11:04.800
in the sort of subtree
on top [INAUDIBLE]

01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:06.800
PROFESSOR: Yeah, we're
doing this transformation

01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:09.389
of the top tree into the
local tree by rotations.

01:11:09.389 --> 01:11:09.930
I mentioned--

01:11:09.930 --> 01:11:12.674
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
It's always--

01:11:12.674 --> 01:11:14.090
PROFESSOR: Right,
so we're staying

01:11:14.090 --> 01:11:16.548
within the binary search tree
model, and in particular then

01:11:16.548 --> 01:11:18.054
we stay a binary search tree.

01:11:18.054 --> 01:11:19.220
So, we can't mess things up.

01:11:19.220 --> 01:11:21.260
And there's a nice theorem that
if you have two binary search

01:11:21.260 --> 01:11:23.000
trees on the same,
keys there's a way

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.280
to get there with the
linear number of rotates,

01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:28.130
so that's for free.

01:11:28.130 --> 01:11:31.790
So, our new cost model
is just to count points.

01:11:31.790 --> 01:11:34.580
The cost of this access is
one, the cost of this access

01:11:34.580 --> 01:11:37.070
is two, two, three.

01:11:37.070 --> 01:11:40.370
If we just count how
many nodes are touched,

01:11:40.370 --> 01:11:43.550
then the cost of the
binary search tree

01:11:43.550 --> 01:11:48.830
is equal to the cost of
the minimum satisfied

01:11:48.830 --> 01:11:50.270
superset of your point.

01:11:50.270 --> 01:11:52.760
So this is the problem now.

01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:56.390
Sadly we don't know how
to solve the problem.

01:11:56.390 --> 01:12:01.080
We do know some things.

01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:03.822
I don't think I'll go
through an example of this,

01:12:03.822 --> 01:12:04.780
it's not very exciting.

01:12:04.780 --> 01:12:08.180
You could run
through this picture,

01:12:08.180 --> 01:12:10.250
and see how the binary
[? structure ?] changes.

01:12:10.250 --> 01:12:11.708
Actually the binary
[? structure ?]

01:12:11.708 --> 01:12:14.360
won't change it all here, so
it's a little anticlimactic

01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:15.030
of an example.

01:12:15.030 --> 01:12:18.200
You can see it in the notes.

01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:25.540
I want to get to the greedy
algorithm, so let's go here.

01:12:34.850 --> 01:12:35.898
Last bullet.

01:13:14.860 --> 01:13:18.540
The idea is to imagine
your points are added one

01:13:18.540 --> 01:13:20.700
at a time, bottom up.

01:13:24.060 --> 01:13:25.680
So I'm going to do
the same example.

01:13:25.680 --> 01:13:27.780
First we add this point.

01:13:27.780 --> 01:13:29.730
That's a satisfied set, done.

01:13:29.730 --> 01:13:50.230
In general add necessary points
on the same row as the search.

01:13:50.230 --> 01:13:51.760
OK, there's nothing to add here.

01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:53.910
Next point we add is over here.

01:13:53.910 --> 01:13:56.170
I've got the orientation
correct, yeah.

01:13:56.170 --> 01:13:59.060
So this was three, this was one.

01:13:59.060 --> 01:14:00.340
Is this satisfied?

01:14:00.340 --> 01:14:02.937
No, there's a bad
rectangle here.

01:14:02.937 --> 01:14:05.020
There's two obvious ways
to satisfy the rectangle,

01:14:05.020 --> 01:14:07.550
I could add a point here,
or I could add a point here.

01:14:07.550 --> 01:14:09.800
I'm going to add a point
here, because that's the row,

01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:10.720
this is current time.

01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:14.050
OK, it's like a
sweep line algorithm.

01:14:14.050 --> 01:14:18.721
We go up, next
point is over here.

01:14:18.721 --> 01:14:20.890
That's the Next
position to sweep line.

01:14:20.890 --> 01:14:22.840
Now there's a bad rectangle.

01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:24.420
We fix it by adding this point.

01:14:27.010 --> 01:14:29.950
Now we're good, all
rectangles are satisfied.

01:14:29.950 --> 01:14:33.490
Next level is,
there's a point here.

01:14:33.490 --> 01:14:35.440
Now there's two bad rectangles.

01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:38.170
This one, I'm going
to add a point here,

01:14:38.170 --> 01:14:40.976
and this one, I'm going
to add a point here.

01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:46.620
Now we're good.

01:14:46.620 --> 01:14:49.740
And that should be
what I did here.

01:14:49.740 --> 01:14:50.240
Yeah.

01:14:52.619 --> 01:14:54.160
So that's how I
found that point set,

01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:57.540
and in general claim is
this is a good algorithm.

01:14:57.540 --> 01:15:01.320
It seems, in fact,
pretty obvious.

01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:04.260
There was a choice of
course, we could satisfy

01:15:04.260 --> 01:15:05.940
this corner or this corner.

01:15:05.940 --> 01:15:09.330
Or some monotone
path in between.

01:15:09.330 --> 01:15:11.010
But the claim would be that--

01:15:15.510 --> 01:15:17.460
doesn't make that
big a difference.

01:15:17.460 --> 01:15:18.970
Doing things later
is always better.

01:15:18.970 --> 01:15:20.550
It's kind of a lazy property.

01:15:20.550 --> 01:15:22.614
Or you could think of this--

01:15:22.614 --> 01:15:24.030
Originally actually
this algorithm

01:15:24.030 --> 01:15:26.160
goes back in tree land.

01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:29.041
And in tree land, if you follow
through this reduction, which

01:15:29.041 --> 01:15:30.540
we did, you know
if you convert this

01:15:30.540 --> 01:15:33.750
into a treap, what
this is saying is,

01:15:33.750 --> 01:15:36.510
look you search for an
item, you follow a path.

01:15:36.510 --> 01:15:39.150
Take all the nodes on
the path that you follow,

01:15:39.150 --> 01:15:41.700
rearrange them optimally
for the future,

01:15:41.700 --> 01:15:45.690
build a heap based on the next
access time, next touch time,

01:15:45.690 --> 01:15:48.270
whenever that happens to be.

01:15:48.270 --> 01:15:51.060
Next access time
actually, in that case.

01:15:51.060 --> 01:15:55.200
That is equivalent
to this algorithm.

01:15:55.200 --> 01:15:57.457
That seems like the right
thing to do offline.

01:15:57.457 --> 01:16:00.040
You visit your item, you do the
minimum amount you have to do,

01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:01.680
which is following
the search path.

01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:04.590
You rearrange those items to
be optimal for the future.

01:16:04.590 --> 01:16:07.020
It's an offline algorithm,
seems like a really good one.

01:16:07.020 --> 01:16:08.610
The only thing
it's missing out on

01:16:08.610 --> 01:16:10.920
is maybe you should
go off the path

01:16:10.920 --> 01:16:13.962
and bring other guys
closer to the root.

01:16:13.962 --> 01:16:16.170
But if you believe, which
we don't know how to prove,

01:16:16.170 --> 01:16:17.503
if you believe that there's no--

01:16:17.503 --> 01:16:19.140
it doesn't really
buy you anything

01:16:19.140 --> 01:16:22.290
to go off the path now,
you can always do it later,

01:16:22.290 --> 01:16:26.500
then this algorithm
is optimal offline.

01:16:26.500 --> 01:16:28.000
And in terms of the
point set it's--

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:29.749
in the point set of
view it's kind of nice

01:16:29.749 --> 01:16:31.360
because it almost
looks online, right.

01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:33.510
You only have to
look at each time

01:16:33.510 --> 01:16:37.080
and add the points at
that time that are useful,

01:16:37.080 --> 01:16:38.490
in terms of the past.

01:16:38.490 --> 01:16:41.444
You only had to satisfy
the rectangles of the past.

01:16:41.444 --> 01:16:43.110
So this is where
things get interesting,

01:16:43.110 --> 01:16:46.100
because in terms of a tree
view, with this transformation,

01:16:46.100 --> 01:16:48.810
this looks like an
offline tree because it

01:16:48.810 --> 01:16:49.890
needs to know the future.

01:16:49.890 --> 01:16:52.270
And it does if you
want to build a heap.

01:16:52.270 --> 01:16:54.360
OK, but if you look
at in the geometric

01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:56.640
view, suddenly it looks
online, because you're only

01:16:56.640 --> 01:16:58.306
looking at the points
and all the points

01:16:58.306 --> 01:16:59.940
you've accessed in the past.

01:16:59.940 --> 01:17:04.050
So, in fact, there's a
way to make this online.

01:17:08.550 --> 01:17:11.329
This is where things
get interesting.

01:17:11.329 --> 01:17:12.870
There is a transformation
that if you

01:17:12.870 --> 01:17:17.100
have an online satisfying
point set, meaning you

01:17:17.100 --> 01:17:19.410
can decide what points to
add based only on the past,

01:17:19.410 --> 01:17:21.480
not on the future.

01:17:21.480 --> 01:17:23.770
So it's a fancier version
of this transformation,

01:17:23.770 --> 01:17:27.460
you get an actual online
binary search tree.

01:17:27.460 --> 01:17:33.510
So, this algorithm goes
back to the '90s I think.

01:17:33.510 --> 01:17:37.440
Actually '88, it's in a
thesis 1988 as rediscovered

01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:42.630
by my PhD adviser in 2000.

01:17:42.630 --> 01:17:45.754
It's totally natural
algorithm, but they thought

01:17:45.754 --> 01:17:46.920
it was an offline algorithm.

01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:49.260
With this view, it's
an online algorithm.

01:17:49.260 --> 01:17:51.930
Let me quickly convince
you, or sketch to you,

01:17:51.930 --> 01:17:54.450
how we make this online.

01:17:54.450 --> 01:18:01.647
So we do the same thing, except
we don't know how to heapify,

01:18:01.647 --> 01:18:03.480
because we don't know
the next access times.

01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:05.025
But we know whatever
we touch, it's

01:18:05.025 --> 01:18:06.990
some connected
subtree of the root.

01:18:06.990 --> 01:18:08.040
We know what we touch.

01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:10.230
We touch whatever greedy
tells us to touch.

01:18:10.230 --> 01:18:12.699
We'll touch all
these guys, whatever.

01:18:12.699 --> 01:18:13.740
How do we rearrange them?

01:18:13.740 --> 01:18:15.090
We don't rearrange them.

01:18:15.090 --> 01:18:18.300
We store them into something
called a split tree.

01:18:21.090 --> 01:18:23.340
Split tree has the
feature, it's a tree.

01:18:23.340 --> 01:18:27.930
Binary search tree, and if
you ask for some item x,

01:18:27.930 --> 01:18:31.230
you can move x to the root.

01:18:31.230 --> 01:18:33.750
So then you have a
left subtree of x,

01:18:33.750 --> 01:18:37.410
right subtree of x,
and then delete x,

01:18:37.410 --> 01:18:40.260
and now you're left with
things that are less than x,

01:18:40.260 --> 01:18:42.170
and things that
are greater than x.

01:18:42.170 --> 01:18:44.550
Things are greater than x.

01:18:44.550 --> 01:18:47.280
And you can do all this
in constant amortize time.

01:18:51.030 --> 01:18:53.610
This is what we need,
if you think about here.

01:18:53.610 --> 01:18:56.460
I'm going to take all these
items that were touched,

01:18:56.460 --> 01:18:59.280
throw them into a split tree.

01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:02.430
My resulting structure will
be a tree of split trees.

01:19:02.430 --> 01:19:05.450
So think of it as, when
I touch all these items

01:19:05.450 --> 01:19:07.200
I just sort of throw
them all in the root,

01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:09.540
but that root is
represented by a split tree.

01:19:09.540 --> 01:19:12.180
And then hanging off here, there
are other split trees which

01:19:12.180 --> 01:19:16.290
may have several keys in them.

01:19:16.290 --> 01:19:19.350
When I do, when I
now touch a node,

01:19:19.350 --> 01:19:22.170
you can show that if I'm
trying to touch some node here,

01:19:22.170 --> 01:19:23.880
I can't just magically
touch a node here.

01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:25.670
I've got to, I had
to have followed

01:19:25.670 --> 01:19:28.170
in the actual tree, whatever
the optimal tree is,

01:19:28.170 --> 01:19:30.722
I had to follow some
route to leave path.

01:19:30.722 --> 01:19:32.430
So in fact, the
predecessor and successor

01:19:32.430 --> 01:19:36.390
here had to have been touched
before I touched this one.

01:19:36.390 --> 01:19:40.280
Which means I'm going
to split those nodes.

01:19:40.280 --> 01:19:44.200
So, when I actually-- this
is basically lazy evaluation.

01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:46.780
When I actually access
something in here,

01:19:46.780 --> 01:19:48.550
that means I want to
pull it to the root.

01:19:48.550 --> 01:19:51.520
I wanted to pretend that
it was at the root, that's

01:19:51.520 --> 01:19:53.860
what the treap would have done.

01:19:53.860 --> 01:19:56.620
So basically pull it
up, be a root, split,

01:19:56.620 --> 01:19:59.020
because now there's
two structures left

01:19:59.020 --> 01:20:00.850
where I don't know
their orders, but I

01:20:00.850 --> 01:20:03.880
know that this item was first.

01:20:03.880 --> 01:20:05.269
And so I end up with--

01:20:05.269 --> 01:20:07.060
I don't actually remove
it, but I remove it

01:20:07.060 --> 01:20:11.570
from the split trees, so
I make it look like this.

01:20:11.570 --> 01:20:14.790
And here's the guy where I
wanted to access something.

01:20:14.790 --> 01:20:17.250
So, I split this root
into two split trees,

01:20:17.250 --> 01:20:19.900
and I have an
individual node up here.

01:20:19.900 --> 01:20:21.730
If I can do this in
constant amortize time,

01:20:21.730 --> 01:20:24.140
it's as if this node was at
the root in the first place.

01:20:24.140 --> 01:20:26.970
And so I simulate this
perfect treap order,

01:20:26.970 --> 01:20:29.530
but using a data
structure, split trees,

01:20:29.530 --> 01:20:31.622
which can actually be solved.

01:20:31.622 --> 01:20:32.830
How do you solve split trees?

01:20:32.830 --> 01:20:37.110
You just do the obvious
thing, more or less.

01:20:37.110 --> 01:20:39.610
Ideas, you know red
black trees, take

01:20:39.610 --> 01:20:41.470
your favorite balanced
binary search tree,

01:20:41.470 --> 01:20:45.620
red black trees work fine.

01:20:45.620 --> 01:20:48.160
If you're given a node,
you can split there.

01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:51.670
You basically just
carve it in half.

01:20:51.670 --> 01:20:53.170
How much does it cost to split?

01:20:53.170 --> 01:20:55.210
Well if you're a
little bit clever,

01:20:55.210 --> 01:20:57.887
let me go to a
board of cleverness.

01:21:00.259 --> 01:21:01.800
The one thing we
have to optimize for

01:21:01.800 --> 01:21:03.425
is, what if you're
splitting like right

01:21:03.425 --> 01:21:05.760
here, very close to the left?

01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:08.580
If you're clever,
you'll search from here,

01:21:08.580 --> 01:21:11.040
and cut off this part in
time basically proportional

01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:13.190
to the height of that tree.

01:21:13.190 --> 01:21:15.180
OK, you might get some
propagation up here,

01:21:15.180 --> 01:21:17.722
but that's very small amortized.

01:21:17.722 --> 01:21:19.680
OK, on the other hand,
if you search over here,

01:21:19.680 --> 01:21:22.600
you'd like to spend only
time proportional to this.

01:21:22.600 --> 01:21:27.060
So in general, if you just
search in parallel here,

01:21:27.060 --> 01:21:29.570
you can split in--

01:21:29.570 --> 01:21:34.410
let's say this has size n one,
and the rest has size n two.

01:21:34.410 --> 01:21:41.710
You can split in order log
the min of n one and n two.

01:21:41.710 --> 01:21:44.220
And you can show that if you
just-- that's straightforward

01:21:44.220 --> 01:21:46.210
splitting, that's
really easy to do.

01:21:46.210 --> 01:21:48.930
You can show that that
implies constant amortized,

01:21:48.930 --> 01:21:51.330
because either you're cutting
off a very little nibble

01:21:51.330 --> 01:21:53.310
and the cost is small,
or you're cutting things

01:21:53.310 --> 01:21:55.650
more or less in half, but
that can't happen very much.

01:21:55.650 --> 01:21:59.130
Then you charge to the fact
that log n is going down by one,

01:21:59.130 --> 01:22:03.400
and overall you get a linear
cost to splitting nodes.

01:22:06.070 --> 01:22:07.134
It's an amortization.

01:22:07.134 --> 01:22:09.300
Now the trouble is this is
not a binary search tree.

01:22:09.300 --> 01:22:10.841
How in the heck do
I have to pointers

01:22:10.841 --> 01:22:12.330
that in parallel search?

01:22:12.330 --> 01:22:14.880
Well you have to take these
two halves of the tree

01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:17.310
and interleave them to make
them a binary search tree.

01:22:17.310 --> 01:22:21.210
It's kind of awkward, but just
put it, mash it all together.

01:22:21.210 --> 01:22:24.350
Fold it in half, basically
and turn it upside down,

01:22:24.350 --> 01:22:25.974
and you've got a
binary search tree.

01:22:25.974 --> 01:22:27.390
So there's some
messy stuff there,

01:22:27.390 --> 01:22:29.580
but that's just a
hand-wavy argument

01:22:29.580 --> 01:22:32.400
that you can make greedy online.

01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:35.280
Next class we'll talk about
lower bounds, which almost

01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:36.630
proved the greedy is optimal.

01:22:36.630 --> 01:22:38.630
But not quite.
