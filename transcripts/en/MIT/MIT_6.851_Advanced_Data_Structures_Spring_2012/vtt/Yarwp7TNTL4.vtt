00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.870
ERIK DEMAINE: All right,
welcome to my last lecture

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:26.880
for the semester.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.090
We finish our coverage
of dynamic graphs,

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.439
and also our coverage
of lower bounds.

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.940
We saw one big lower
bound in this class

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.502
in the cell probe model.

00:00:37.502 --> 00:00:39.210
You may recall cell
probe model, you just

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.500
count how many cells
of memory do you touch.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.680
You want to prove a
lower bound on that.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.180
And today we're going to prove
a cell probe from lower bound

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.570
on dynamic connectivity,
which is a problem we've

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.030
solved a few different times.

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.920
Our lower bound
will apply even when

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.920
each of the connected components
of your graph are just a path.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.600
And so in particular, they
imply matching lower bounds

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.665
for dynamic trees.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.120
So here is the theorem
we'll be proving today.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:27.270
You want to insert
and delete edges,

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:35.970
and do connectivity queries
between pairs of vertices, vw.

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.720
I want to know is there
a path from v to w,

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.490
just like we've
been considering.

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:52.320
These require omega log
n, time for operation.

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.990
This is the max of
updating, query times has

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.860
to be at least log n
time per operation,

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:16.170
even if the connected
components are paths, and even

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.958
amortized, and even randomized.

00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:23.700
Although I'm not going to
prove of all of these versions,

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.130
I won't prove the
amortized version.

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.280
I'm going to prove a worst
case log and lower bound,

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.930
it's just a little more work to
prove an amortized lower bound.

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.460
But same principles.

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:41.500
And so that's going to be
today, is proving this theorem.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.640
It's not a short
proof, but it combines

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.580
a bunch of relatively
simple ideas,

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.060
and ends up being pretty
clean overall, piece-by-piece,

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.810
but there's just a bunch of
pieces, as we will get to.

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.600
Key concept is an
idea introduced

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.140
in this paper, which is
to build a balanced binary

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.190
tree over time, over
your access sequence.

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.600
And argue about different
subtrees within that tree.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.520
This is a paper that maybe
came out of this class,

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.500
in some sense, it was by
Mihai Patrascu and myself.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.510
Back when Mihai
was an undergrad,

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.966
I think he'd just
taken this class.

00:03:23.966 --> 00:03:25.590
But at that point
the class didn't even

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:26.923
cover dynamic connectivity, so--

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.535
and time here is cell probes.

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.050
So this is a very
strong model, it

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.570
implies a lower bound on ram,
and implies a lower bound

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:42.840
on pointer machine.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.380
We know matching
upper bounds for trees

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.990
on a pointer machine
link/cut trees

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:50.560
in [INAUDIBLE] to our trees.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.790
It's kind of fun that this lower
bound even applies to paths,

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.740
because most of the
work in link/cut trees

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.914
is about decomposing
your tree into paths.

00:03:57.914 --> 00:04:00.330
And so what this is saying is
even if that's done for you,

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.720
and you just need to be able
to take paths, and concatenate

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:10.380
them together by adding edges,
then maintaining the find root

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.080
property so that you can
do connectivity queries,

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.550
even that requires log n time.

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:19.350
So converting a tree into
a path is basically free,

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.010
the hard part is
maintaining the paths.

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.830
So let's prove a theorem.

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.030
The lower bound,
we get to choose

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.550
what access sequence
we think is bad.

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:37.170
And so we're going to come
up with a particular style

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:42.703
of graph, which looks
like the following.

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:55.190
Graph is going to be--

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:57.530
the vertices are going to
be a root n by root n grid.

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.950
And we're going to--

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:06.300
these guys are in,
what did I call them?

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:07.280
Groups?

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.340
Columns.

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.160
Columns is a good name.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:15.620
These are columns of
the matrix, or vertices.

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.760
And what I'd like to have is
between consecutive columns,

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.140
I want to have a
perfect matching

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.232
between these vertices.

00:05:23.232 --> 00:05:28.580
So could be, I don't know, this
edge, this edge, this edge,

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:29.554
and that edge.

00:05:29.554 --> 00:05:31.970
And I also want a perfect match
between these two columns,

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:39.950
so maybe this one, this
one, this one, this one.

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:46.340
And you can have some
boring things too.

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:47.180
Something like that.

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:53.815
So between every pair of
columns is a perfect matching,

00:05:53.815 --> 00:05:54.815
meaning perfect pairing.

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:01.370
OK, this of course results
in a collection of paths,

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:02.660
square root of n paths.

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.970
You can start at any
vertex on the left,

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:07.420
and you'll have a unique
way to go to the right.

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:13.430
And so that's path 1, this
is path 2, this is path 3,

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:16.070
and this is path 4.

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:20.720
And so if I-- an
interesting query.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.450
Well, an interesting query is
something like I want to know,

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:26.877
is this vertex
connected to this one?

00:06:26.877 --> 00:06:28.460
And it's not so easy
to figure it out,

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:31.490
because you have to sort
of walk through this path

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:32.349
to figure that out.

00:06:32.349 --> 00:06:34.640
We're going to think of each
of these perfect matchings

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:41.060
as defining a permutation on the
vertices, on the column really.

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:43.940
So you start with the
identity permutation,

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:46.480
and then some things get
swapped around, that's pi 1.

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.750
Something gets swapped
around again, that's pi 2.

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:51.170
Somethings get swapped
around here, that's pi 3.

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:57.500
And then this position would
be pi 3 of pi 2 of pi 1

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:01.940
of vertex 4.

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:05.960
We call this vertex 4.

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:09.200
Or row, row 4.

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.990
So in some sense, we have
to compose permutations.

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:20.132
I'll call this pi 1, circle
pi 2, circle pi 3 of 4.

00:07:20.132 --> 00:07:21.590
And we're going to
show, basically,

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:24.470
composing permutations is
tough when you can change

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:26.630
those permutations dynamically.

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:28.340
So what we're going
to do is a series

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:37.130
of block operations,
which change or query

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:39.660
entire permutations.

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:45.470
So here, an update is going to
be a whole bunch of insertions

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:48.230
and deletions of edges.

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:53.966
Basically, what we want to
do is set pi i equal to pi.

00:07:53.966 --> 00:07:57.380
So that's what update
of i comma pi does.

00:07:57.380 --> 00:08:00.110
It changes an entire
perfect matching

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:02.914
to be a specified permutation.

00:08:02.914 --> 00:08:03.830
So how do you do that?

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:05.300
Well, you delete
all the edges that

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:06.841
are in the existing
permutation, then

00:08:06.841 --> 00:08:08.940
you insert all the new edges.

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:15.200
So this can be done in square
root of n edge deletions

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:15.980
and insertions.

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:26.460
So it's a bulk update of
square root of n operations.

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:28.920
And so this could only
make our problem easier,

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:30.980
because we're given
square root of n updates

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:33.360
that we all need to do at once.

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.850
So you could amortize
over them, you

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:38.520
could do lots of
different things,

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:42.059
but we're sure that won't help.

00:08:42.059 --> 00:08:45.300
And then we have a
query, and the query

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:49.609
is going to be a
little bit weird,

00:08:49.609 --> 00:08:51.900
and it's also going to make
the proof a little bit more

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:53.400
awkward.

00:08:53.400 --> 00:09:03.570
But what it asks is if I look at
the composition of pi j, from 1

00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:05.630
up to i.

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:07.622
This is 1.

00:09:07.622 --> 00:09:12.660
So I want to know is that
composition equal to pi?

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:13.680
Yes or no?

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:18.720
This is what I'll call verify
sum, sum meaning composition.

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:21.210
But the sum terminology comes
from a different problem,

00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:22.890
which we won't
talk about directly

00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:25.140
here, called partial sums.

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:27.240
Partial sums is
basically this problem,

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:29.580
you can change
numbers in an array,

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:33.440
and you can compute the
prefix sum from 1 up to i.

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:36.780
Here we're not computing it.

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:37.950
Why are we not computing it?

00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:41.370
Because actually figuring out
what pi 3, or pi 2 of pi 1

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:45.330
is of something is
tricky in this setting.

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:48.120
The operations we're given
are, given two vertices,

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:51.510
are they connected by a path?

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:56.989
So to figure out the other end
of this path, that requires--

00:09:56.989 --> 00:09:59.280
I mean, it's hard to figure
out where the other end is.

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:02.010
If I told you is it this one?

00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:05.280
Then I can answer that question
with just a connectivity query.

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:09.490
So verify sum can be done
with order square root

00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:12.715
of n connectivity queries.

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:22.770
Whereas computing the sum could
not be, as far as we know.

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:25.980
If I tell you what that
composition is supposed to be,

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:29.280
I can check does 4 go to 1?

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:30.610
Yes or no?

00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:32.670
Does 3 go to 3?

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:33.370
Yes or no?

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:35.520
Does 2 go to 4?

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:36.110
Yes or no?

00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:37.780
Does 1 go to 2?

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:38.490
Yes or no?

00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:41.910
So with 4 queries, I can
check whether the permutation

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:44.790
is what it is.

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:47.060
If any of those fail,
then I return no.

00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:53.400
So the way this proceeds is
first we proved a lower bound

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:56.880
on partial sums,
which is computing

00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:01.260
this value when you're not
told what the answer is.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.801
And then we extended that,
and we'll do such a proof here

00:11:03.801 --> 00:11:04.300
today.

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:06.466
First, we're going to prove
a lower bound on the sum

00:11:06.466 --> 00:11:09.030
operation, which is
computing this value that's

00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:14.640
on our outline over
here, sum lower bound.

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:17.580
And then we'll extend that and
make the argument a little bit

00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:20.940
more complicated, then we'll
get an actual connectivity lower

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:23.740
bound, a lower
bound on verify sum.

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:26.010
OK, but obviously
if we can prove

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:29.490
that these operations
take a long time to do,

00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:33.150
we can prove that these original
operations take a long time

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:34.410
to do.

00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:46.700
So what we claim is that
square root of n updates,

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:58.260
these block updates plus square
of n verify some queries,

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:12.220
require root n times
root n log n cell probes.

00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:22.360
I guess this is the
amortized claim.

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:25.070
So if I want to do root n
updates and root n queries,

00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:27.590
and I take root n times
root n times log n--

00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:29.750
funny way of writing n log n--

00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:32.436
cell probes, then
if I divide through,

00:12:32.436 --> 00:12:33.810
I want the amortized
lower bound,

00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:36.770
I lose one of these
root ns, because I'm

00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:38.030
doing different operations.

00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:40.330
I lose another root n,
because each of these updates

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:41.705
corresponds to
root n operations.

00:12:41.705 --> 00:12:43.370
Each of the verify
sums corresponds

00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:44.660
to root n operations.

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:48.080
So overall per operation,
per original operation

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:50.660
of edge deletion insertion
or connectivity query,

00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:52.440
I'm paying log n per operation.

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:57.474
So if I can prove this claim,
then I get this theorem.

00:12:57.474 --> 00:12:59.020
All clear?

00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:02.039
So now we've reduced the problem
to these bulk operations,

00:13:02.039 --> 00:13:04.080
we'll just be thinking
about the bulk operations,

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:05.160
update verify sum.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.320
We won't think about
edge deletion insertions

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:09.041
and connectivity
queries anymore.

00:13:14.794 --> 00:13:15.294
OK.

00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:20.600
So this is just sort
of the general set up

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:22.650
of what the graphs are
going to look like.

00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:25.460
And now I'm going to tell
you what sequence of updates

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:28.840
and verify sums we're actually
going to do that are bad.

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:31.520
This is the bad access sequence.

00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:42.642
And this is actually something
we've seen before in lecture 6,

00:13:42.642 --> 00:13:44.225
I think, the binary
search tree stuff.

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:51.575
We're going to look at
the bit reversal sequence.

00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:03.830
So you may recall a
bit reversal sequence.

00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:14.580
You take binary numbers in
order, reverse the bits.

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:28.370
So this becomes 000, 100, 010,
110, 001, 101, 011, and 111.

00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:33.620
So those are the
reversed strings.

00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:35.970
And then you reinterpret
those as regular numbers.

00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:43.244
So this is 0, 4,
2, 6, and then it

00:14:43.244 --> 00:14:45.160
should be the same thing,
but the odd version.

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:49.100
So I have 1, 5, 3, 7.

00:14:51.926 --> 00:14:56.270
OK, I claimed, I think
probably didn't prove,

00:14:56.270 --> 00:15:00.760
that this bit reversal sequence
has a high Wilber lower bound.

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:04.890
And so any binary search tree
accessing items in this order

00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:06.470
requires log n per operation.

00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:08.130
And we want log n
per operation here,

00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:10.430
so it seems like a
good choice, why not?

00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:13.580
So we're going to follow
this access sequence.

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:15.170
And sorry, I've
changed notation here,

00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:18.320
we're going to number
the permutations from 0

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:21.710
to root n minus 1 now.

00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:24.270
And assume root n
is a power of 2,

00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:27.140
so the bit reversal
sequence is well defined.

00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:34.940
And then we are going to do
two things for each such i.

00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:37.538
We're going to do a
verify sum operation.

00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:51.642
Actually maybe it is
starting at 1, I don't know.

00:15:51.642 --> 00:15:53.330
It doesn't matter.

00:15:53.330 --> 00:16:06.250
And then we'll do an update

00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:09.010
OK, so let's see.

00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:11.860
This pi random is just a
uniform random permutation,

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:15.400
it's computed fresh every time.

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:20.380
So we're just re-randomizing
pi i in this operation.

00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:22.300
Before we do that,
we're checking

00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:25.600
that the sum, the composition
of all the permutations up

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:28.750
to position i, is what it is.

00:16:28.750 --> 00:16:31.300
So this is the
actual value here,

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:35.390
and we're verifying that
that is indeed the sum.

00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:39.100
So this will always return yes.

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:41.750
But data structure
has to be correct.

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:45.050
So it needs to really verify
that that is the case.

00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:48.100
There's the threat that maybe
we gave the wrong answer here,

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:50.170
and it needs to double
check that that is indeed

00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:51.190
the right answer.

00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:54.140
It may seem a little weird,
but we'll see why it works.

00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:56.410
So this is the bad
access sequence.

00:16:56.410 --> 00:17:03.540
Just do a query, do an update
in this weird order in i.

00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:11.230
OK, and big idea is to
build a nice balanced binary

00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:14.109
tree over time.

00:17:18.079 --> 00:17:26.514
So we have on the ground
here 0, 4, 2, 6, 1, 5, 3, 7.

00:17:26.514 --> 00:17:31.000
And when I write 5, I
mean verify sum of 5,

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.820
and update permutation 5.

00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:36.010
And then we can build
a binary tree on that.

00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:43.660
And for each node
in this tree, we

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:45.790
have the notion
of a left subtree,

00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:48.010
and we have the notion
of a right subtree.

00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:49.990
And cool thing about
bit reversal sequence

00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:52.960
is this nice self-similarity.

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:55.330
If you look at the left
subtree of any node

00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:58.630
and the right subtree of any of
node, those items interleave.

00:17:58.630 --> 00:18:00.910
If you look at the sorted
order, it's 1 on the left,

00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:03.190
3 on the right, 5 on the
left, 7 on the right.

00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:04.687
They always
perfectly interleave,

00:18:04.687 --> 00:18:06.520
because this thing is
designed to interleave

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:09.310
at every possible level.

00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:12.190
So that's the fact
we're going to use.

00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:18.670
We're going to analyze each node
separately, and talk about what

00:18:18.670 --> 00:18:22.690
information has to be
carried from the left subtree

00:18:22.690 --> 00:18:24.340
to the right subtree.

00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:27.100
In particular, we're
interested in the updates being

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:29.410
done on the left subtree,
because here we change pi 1,

00:18:29.410 --> 00:18:31.150
we change pi 5.

00:18:31.150 --> 00:18:33.300
And the query's being
done on the right subtree,

00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:36.610
because here we
query 3, we query 7.

00:18:36.610 --> 00:18:39.310
When we query 3, that
queries everything,

00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:40.690
all the permutations, up to 3.

00:18:40.690 --> 00:18:43.380
It's a composition of
all permutations up to 3.

00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:45.287
So in particular it involves 1.

00:18:45.287 --> 00:18:47.620
So the claim is going to be
that the permutation that we

00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:51.220
set in 1 has to be carried
over to this query.

00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:54.670
And similarly, a
changing permutation 5

00:18:54.670 --> 00:18:55.990
will affect the query for 7.

00:18:55.990 --> 00:19:00.550
Also query, the update for 1,
will affect the query for 7.

00:19:00.550 --> 00:19:02.950
So we need to formalize
that little bit.

00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:12.230
So here is the claim.

00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:28.760
For every node in
the tree, say it

00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:35.400
has l leaves in its subtree--

00:19:42.742 --> 00:19:47.430
This should be a comma and
this should be a colon.

00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:51.060
Here's what we say.

00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:54.960
During the right subtree
of v, so right subtree

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:57.850
corresponds to an
interval of time.

00:19:57.850 --> 00:20:00.750
So we're talking about
those operations done

00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:06.270
during the right subtree
of v. Claim is we must

00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:11.190
do omega l root n cell probes--

00:20:15.898 --> 00:20:19.275
sorry, expected cell probes.

00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:24.490
We are using some
randomness here, right?

00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:27.350
We said we're going to
update each permutation

00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:28.730
to a random value,
so we can only

00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:31.577
make claims about the
expected performance.

00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:36.549
Fine.

00:20:36.549 --> 00:20:38.090
But that's actually
a stronger thing,

00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:41.150
it implies a lower bound, even
for randomized algorithms.

00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:42.960
So if you can randomize
your input set.

00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:49.640
And then not just
any cell probes,

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:55.490
but they're cell probes
that read cells last written

00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:56.555
during the left subtree.

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:12.690
So this is what I was saying
at a high level before.

00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:16.350
We're looking at
reads over here,

00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:19.440
to cells that are
written over here.

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:22.140
Because we claim the
updates over here

00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:24.750
have to store some
information that is--

00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:29.134
whatever the updates that happen
over here influence the queries

00:21:29.134 --> 00:21:30.050
that happen over here.

00:21:30.050 --> 00:21:31.841
So these queries have
to read the data that

00:21:31.841 --> 00:21:33.630
was written over here.

00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:36.990
And specifically, we're
claiming at least l root n

00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:40.140
cell probes have to
be read over here,

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:42.420
from cells that were written--

00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:45.870
that were basically just
written in the left subtree.

00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:50.490
If we could prove this, then
we get our other claim--

00:21:50.490 --> 00:21:54.450
this one over here, that root
n updates, and root n verifies

00:21:54.450 --> 00:21:57.900
sums that require
this much time.

00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:01.290
The difference
is-- well, here we

00:22:01.290 --> 00:22:03.900
have an l, for an l leaf tree.

00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:07.710
And so what I'd like to
do is sum this lower bound

00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:09.390
over every node in the tree.

00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:12.625
I need to check that
that is valid to do.

00:22:12.625 --> 00:22:13.740
So let's do that.

00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:28.530
OK, for every node
v, we are claiming

00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:30.900
there's a certain number of
reads that happen over here,

00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:33.030
that correspond to
writes over here.

00:22:33.030 --> 00:22:35.490
But let's say you
look at the parent

00:22:35.490 --> 00:22:37.184
of v, which is over here.

00:22:37.184 --> 00:22:38.850
This thing is also
in the right subtree,

00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:40.680
and we're claiming there's
some number of reads

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:43.180
on the right subtree, that read
things that are written over

00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:43.710
on the left.

00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:45.960
The worry would be that
the reads we counted here,

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:47.640
we also count at
the next level up.

00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:49.723
We don't want to double
count in our lower bounds.

00:22:49.723 --> 00:22:53.796
If we're able to sum them up,
we can't be double counting.

00:22:53.796 --> 00:22:55.170
But the claim is
we're not double

00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:57.870
counting, because if you
look at any particular--

00:22:57.870 --> 00:23:02.990
any read-- so here's time, and
suppose you do a read here.

00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:05.534
You're reading a cell that was
written sometime in the past,

00:23:05.534 --> 00:23:07.950
if it was never written, it's
a not very interesting read,

00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:09.780
it communicates no information.

00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:13.410
So there's some write
in the past that changed

00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:15.420
the cell that's just read.

00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:18.390
And we are going
to count this read

00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:23.827
at a particular node, namely
the lca of those two times.

00:23:23.827 --> 00:23:25.410
So if you look at
the lca of the times

00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:27.890
of the reads and the writes,
that is the single note

00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:29.755
that we'll think
about that read that

00:23:29.755 --> 00:23:31.380
happened in the right
subtree, that was

00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:33.400
written in the left subtree.

00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:45.465
So no double counting, because
we only count at the lca.

00:23:48.496 --> 00:23:50.370
The other thing that we
need to be able to do

00:23:50.370 --> 00:23:52.270
is, because this is an
expected lower bound,

00:23:52.270 --> 00:23:53.760
we need linearity
of expectation.

00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:57.300
But expectation is indeed
linear, so we're all set.

00:24:01.755 --> 00:24:03.860
OK, so all that's left
is a little bit of common

00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:07.260
[INAUDIBLE] if we take l
root n, where l is the size

00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:10.290
of the subtree
below a given node,

00:24:10.290 --> 00:24:13.350
we sum that up over all nodes,
and it's a balanced binary

00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:15.260
search tree--

00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:18.870
or a balanced binary tree, I
should say, not a search tree.

00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:20.170
What do we get?

00:24:20.170 --> 00:24:24.370
Well, every leaf appears
in log n subtrees.

00:24:24.370 --> 00:24:30.740
So we get the total size of
the tree times log n for this,

00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:32.490
and we get another
root n over here.

00:24:32.490 --> 00:24:35.550
The total size of
the tree is root n.

00:24:35.550 --> 00:24:40.980
So we get this root
n log n, that's

00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:42.570
when you sum up the l part.

00:24:42.570 --> 00:24:46.170
Then everything gets
multiplied by root n,

00:24:46.170 --> 00:24:47.820
and that becomes
our lower bound,

00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:51.790
and that's exactly
what we need over here.

00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:55.256
So now this claim is done.

00:24:55.256 --> 00:24:57.000
Maybe I should do a check mark.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.660
Provided we can
prove this claim.

00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:01.360
So now our goal is
to prove this thing.

00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:03.520
And now we're in a
more local world,

00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:06.210
looking at a single node,
counting reads over here,

00:25:06.210 --> 00:25:08.007
the corresponding
rights over there.

00:25:08.007 --> 00:25:09.840
And then you just add
up those lower bounds,

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:10.980
you get what you want.

00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:12.480
So this is where
the log comes from,

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:14.370
because it's a balanced tree.

00:25:14.370 --> 00:25:17.160
And there's log n levels in
a balanced tree, that's where

00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:18.870
we're getting our lower bound.

00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:21.450
The root n's are just keeping
track of the size of the things

00:25:21.450 --> 00:25:22.641
we're manipulating.

00:25:26.852 --> 00:25:30.170
All right.

00:25:30.170 --> 00:25:34.730
So it remains to
prove this claim.

00:25:38.170 --> 00:25:39.790
Prove that claim,
we get that claim,

00:25:39.790 --> 00:25:40.998
and then we get this theorem.

00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:08.585
So proof of claim.

00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:18.860
We're going to do an
information theoretic

00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:21.950
argument, so let me set it up.

00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:24.050
It's again, it's
making this claim

00:26:24.050 --> 00:26:26.180
I said before, that
the permutations that

00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:27.830
get written over
here somehow have

00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:29.750
to be communicated to
the queries over here,

00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:33.380
because they matter.

00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:36.670
Because the permutations
that get said over here

00:26:36.670 --> 00:26:39.290
changed the answers to
all the queries over here,

00:26:39.290 --> 00:26:42.860
because of the interleaving
between left and right.

00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:45.710
So how are we going
to formalize that?

00:26:45.710 --> 00:26:57.950
Well, left subtree
does l/2 updates

00:26:57.950 --> 00:27:06.614
with l/2 random permutations,
uniform random permutations,

00:27:06.614 --> 00:27:08.030
because every node
does an update.

00:27:10.910 --> 00:27:13.760
And so the information
theoretic idea

00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:25.790
is that if we were to somehow
encode those permutations,

00:27:25.790 --> 00:27:34.720
That encoding must
use omega l log l--

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:35.220
l?

00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:36.630
No, I'm sorry.

00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:39.020
It's not right.

00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:45.905
Off by some root n factors
here, l root n log n.

00:27:45.905 --> 00:27:48.380
OK, each permutation
must take root n

00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:51.470
log root n bits to encode.

00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:53.270
If you have a
random permutation,

00:27:53.270 --> 00:27:56.030
expected number of bits have
a very high probability.

00:27:56.030 --> 00:27:57.530
Almost every
permutation requires

00:27:57.530 --> 00:27:59.484
root n log root n bits.

00:27:59.484 --> 00:28:01.400
I'm not going to worry
about constant factors,

00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:04.197
put an omega here, so the
root n turns into an n.

00:28:04.197 --> 00:28:05.780
And then we've got
l over two of them,

00:28:05.780 --> 00:28:09.691
so again, ignoring constant
factors, that's l root n log n

00:28:09.691 --> 00:28:10.190
bits.

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:17.510
And this is just
information, theoretic fact,

00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:19.490
our common [INAUDIBLE]
theory fact.

00:28:19.490 --> 00:28:25.460
And once we know that,
the idea is let's

00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:28.010
find an encoding that's
better than this,

00:28:28.010 --> 00:28:29.680
and get a contradiction.

00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:31.430
Of course we shouldn't
get a contradiction

00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:33.530
unless this claim is false.

00:28:33.530 --> 00:28:36.110
So either this claim is
true and we're happy,

00:28:36.110 --> 00:28:38.240
but if somehow the
word not enough cell

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:40.940
reads on the right, that
did things that were written

00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:43.550
on the left, then
we will, from that,

00:28:43.550 --> 00:28:48.590
get a smaller encoding of
the update permutations

00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:50.330
that happen on the left.

00:28:50.330 --> 00:28:51.830
If we could somehow
do that, then we

00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:55.130
can get a contradiction, and
therefore conclude the claim

00:28:55.130 --> 00:28:57.770
is in fact true.

00:28:57.770 --> 00:29:15.800
So, if the claim fails, we'll
find a smaller encoding, which

00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:17.442
will give us a contradiction.

00:29:24.050 --> 00:29:32.260
All right, so let's set up
this problem a little bit more.

00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:34.900
I'm going to--
because we're really

00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:39.460
just interested in this subtree
v stuff on the left, stuff

00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:42.420
on the right, but this of course
lives in a much bigger tree,

00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:44.320
there's stuff that
happens over here.

00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:46.870
This I will call the past.

00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:51.160
I'm just going to assume we
know everything about the past.

00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:55.090
Everything to the
left of the subtree,

00:29:55.090 --> 00:29:56.530
we can assume that we know.

00:29:56.530 --> 00:29:59.420
When I say we know,
what do we know?

00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:02.020
We know all the updates, we know
all the queries that happen,

00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:04.220
and we know, at this
moment in particular,

00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:06.790
what is the state of
the data structure.

00:30:06.790 --> 00:30:09.760
Because this claim has
nothing to do with this stuff,

00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:12.850
it's all about reads here that
corresponds to writes here.

00:30:12.850 --> 00:30:15.610
So we can just assume we know
everything up to this point.

00:30:15.610 --> 00:30:18.946
In our encoding,
this is a key point.

00:30:18.946 --> 00:30:21.160
One way to say this in
a probabilistic sense

00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:23.680
is we're conditioning on
what happened over here

00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:25.820
on the left, what
updates happened.

00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:28.450
And if we can prove that
whatever we need to happen here

00:30:28.450 --> 00:30:31.150
holds no matter what
the condition is,

00:30:31.150 --> 00:30:33.190
then it will hold overall.

00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:35.800
So that's probabilistic
justification

00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:40.420
for why we can assume
we know the past OK.

00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:48.312
So then our goal
is to encode, this

00:30:48.312 --> 00:30:50.020
is a little bit
different from this goal.

00:31:07.050 --> 00:31:10.700
What we really want to do is
encode the update permutations

00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:12.825
on the left.

00:31:12.825 --> 00:31:14.450
That's a little
awkward to think about,

00:31:14.450 --> 00:31:17.030
because this is a claim
about how many probes

00:31:17.030 --> 00:31:18.800
happen on the right.

00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:20.690
So instead, what
we're going to do

00:31:20.690 --> 00:31:24.200
is encode the query
permutations on the right.

00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:27.230
So there are updates over here,
that's what we want to encode,

00:31:27.230 --> 00:31:29.590
but we're instead going to
encode the queries over here.

00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:32.480
I claim if you know what
the results of the queries

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:35.480
were over here,
then you know what

00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:38.470
the updates were over there.

00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:41.560
Basically because of this
interleaving property.

00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:43.945
So I can write that down
a little more formally.

00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:57.730
So if we look at
time here, over,

00:31:57.730 --> 00:31:59.020
let's say this is v's subtree.

00:32:03.510 --> 00:32:07.500
Then what we have are
a sequence of updates

00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:09.490
and a sequence of queries.

00:32:13.354 --> 00:32:18.955
These are queries,
and these are updates.

00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:24.790
This is what the
sequence looks like--

00:32:24.790 --> 00:32:28.770
sorry, this is v's subtree,
this is the pi is, I should say.

00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:34.700
I mean, these operations are
all happened during time,

00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:38.436
but now I'm sorting by i.

00:32:38.436 --> 00:32:41.239
A little confusing.

00:32:41.239 --> 00:32:43.030
There are two orders
to think about, right?

00:32:43.030 --> 00:32:46.820
There's the sequence
over time, we're

00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:48.470
now looking at
such a left subtree

00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:51.230
where we do say 1, 5, and 3, 7.

00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:53.690
What that means-- so you're
imagining here, this is 1,

00:32:53.690 --> 00:32:55.580
this is 5, this is 3, this is 7.

00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:58.240
Here we're sorted by the
value written down there,

00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:00.770
we're sorting by the i,
the pi i that they're

00:33:00.770 --> 00:33:03.080
changing or querying.

00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:13.130
And so all the read things
are in the right subtree of v.

00:33:13.130 --> 00:33:23.090
And all the updates are
in the left subtree of v.

00:33:23.090 --> 00:33:24.539
This is the
interleaving property

00:33:24.539 --> 00:33:25.580
that I mentioned earlier.

00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:32.180
So I claim that if I encode
the results of the queries,

00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:35.990
namely I encode
these permutations,

00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:37.220
these are like summary--

00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:37.970
partial sums.

00:33:37.970 --> 00:33:41.480
These are prefixed sums
of the permutation list.

00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:43.970
Then I can figure out
what the updates were.

00:33:43.970 --> 00:33:44.900
Why?

00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:48.470
Because if I figure out
what this query, what

00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:50.000
it's permutation
is, that's the sum

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.110
of all of these permutations.

00:33:52.110 --> 00:33:55.250
Now only one of them
changed in the left subtree,

00:33:55.250 --> 00:33:58.190
the rest all are in the past.

00:33:58.190 --> 00:34:01.580
They were all set before
this time over here,

00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:04.640
and I know everything about
the past, I'm assuming.

00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:07.730
So most of these I already
know, the one thing I don't know

00:34:07.730 --> 00:34:13.010
is this one, but I claim
if I know this sum,

00:34:13.010 --> 00:34:15.770
and I know all the others,
then I can figure out

00:34:15.770 --> 00:34:17.239
what this one is, right?

00:34:17.239 --> 00:34:20.469
It's slightly awkward to
do, if I give you this,

00:34:20.469 --> 00:34:29.960
I give you the sum of pi j from
j equals 0 to i, or something.

00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:33.320
I've got to--

00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:37.719
I want to strip away all
these, strip away all these.

00:34:37.719 --> 00:34:44.659
So I'm going to multiply by
sum of pi j inverses over here,

00:34:44.659 --> 00:34:48.350
and multiply by sum pi j--

00:34:48.350 --> 00:34:50.760
when I say multiply,
I mean compose.

00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:53.060
Sum pi j inverse is
here, maybe let's not

00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:54.870
worry about the
exact indices here.

00:34:54.870 --> 00:34:58.220
But the point is, this
is all in the past,

00:34:58.220 --> 00:35:01.700
and this is all in the past,
so I know all these pi js,

00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:03.750
I know they're inverses.

00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:05.750
So if I have this
total sum, and I right

00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:07.340
multiply with these
inverses, left

00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:10.400
multiply with these inverses,
I get the one that I want.

00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:19.190
This gives me some particular pi
k, if I set the indices right.

00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:22.760
OK?

00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:26.330
So if I know this query, I
figure out what this update is.

00:35:26.330 --> 00:35:29.480
Now once I know what this update
is, and I know this query, then

00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:33.440
in this sum, I know everything
except this one thing.

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:35.740
And so by using
the same trick, I

00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:37.280
can figure out what
this update is.

00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:39.230
So now I know the
first two updates,

00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:41.000
if I then know the
answer to this query,

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:42.200
I can figure out
what this update is.

00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:43.190
If I know the answer
to this query,

00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:44.231
I can figure this update.

00:35:44.231 --> 00:35:46.060
Because they're
perfectly interleaved,

00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:49.290
I only need to reconstruct
one update at a time.

00:35:49.290 --> 00:35:50.360
So if I'm given--

00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:54.260
if I've somehow encoded
all of the queries results,

00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:58.430
all of these prefix sums,
and I'm given the past,

00:35:58.430 --> 00:36:01.490
then I can reconstruct
what all the updates were.

00:36:01.490 --> 00:36:05.570
So that's basically saying
these two are the same issue.

00:36:05.570 --> 00:36:08.420
If I can encode the verified
sums in the right subtree,

00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:11.180
using less than l
root n log n bits,

00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:13.330
then I'll get a contradiction,
because it implies

00:36:13.330 --> 00:36:15.170
that from that
same encoding, you

00:36:15.170 --> 00:36:17.630
can also decode the
update permutations

00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:20.459
in the left subtree.

00:36:20.459 --> 00:36:21.250
So that's our goal.

00:36:24.761 --> 00:36:25.260
OK.

00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:33.592
So we'd like to prove
this for verify sum.

00:36:33.592 --> 00:36:35.050
But the first thing
I'm going to do

00:36:35.050 --> 00:36:39.640
is consider an easier
problem, which is sum.

00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:43.740
So suppose, basically, this
was not an input to the query.

00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:47.820
Suppose the query was,
what is the sum of i?

00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:48.750
Like this.

00:36:48.750 --> 00:36:52.360
I just want-- this is
the partial sum problem.

00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:54.360
I'm given an index
i, I want to know

00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:58.080
what is the permutation
from pi 0 up to pi i.

00:36:58.080 --> 00:36:59.720
Now that is not--

00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:01.720
that doesn't correspond
to dynamic connectivity,

00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:03.010
it's a new problem.

00:37:03.010 --> 00:37:05.051
We'll first prove a lower
bound for that problem,

00:37:05.051 --> 00:37:07.545
and then we'll put the
verify word back in.

00:37:07.545 --> 00:37:14.660
OK, so that's-- we're now
here at sum lower bound.

00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:15.620
Where should I go?

00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:21.269
Different-- so this is a lower
bound on the operation sum,

00:37:21.269 --> 00:37:23.560
as opposed to here, where
we're adding up lower bounds.

00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:27.490
Sorry for the
conflation of terms.

00:37:27.490 --> 00:37:30.170
Let's go here.

00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:50.730
So I'll call this a warm up.

00:37:58.690 --> 00:38:02.150
Suppose a query
is sum of i, which

00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:08.290
is supposed to give you this
prefix sum of pi j again,

00:38:08.290 --> 00:38:09.980
sum means composition.

00:38:13.060 --> 00:38:19.560
So this is going to be
relatively easy to prove,

00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:22.230
but it's not the problem
we actually want to solve,

00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:25.660
we'll use it to then
solve the real problem.

00:38:25.660 --> 00:38:28.390
And this is the order in which
we actually solve things.

00:38:28.390 --> 00:38:31.200
First, we prove a lower
bound of partial sums.

00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:34.500
OK, so let me give
you some notation,

00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:38.910
so we can really
get at this claim.

00:38:38.910 --> 00:38:42.630
Reading on the right,
writing on the left.

00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:44.580
So let r be all
the cells that are

00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:51.270
read during the right subtree,
which is an interval of time.

00:38:54.150 --> 00:38:59.130
And let w be the cells
written in the left subtree.

00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:14.440
OK, so what we're
talking about over here

00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:17.645
is that r intersects
w, those are cells that

00:39:17.645 --> 00:39:19.270
are read during the
right subtree, that

00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:22.420
were at some point written
during the left subtree,

00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:23.506
should be large.

00:39:23.506 --> 00:39:24.880
So we want to
prove a lower bound

00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:26.777
on the size of r intersect w.

00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:34.090
So if the lower
bound doesn't hold,

00:39:34.090 --> 00:39:37.880
that means that r intersect
w is relatively small.

00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:40.550
So imagine a situation where
r intersect w is very small,

00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:42.010
there's not very
much information

00:39:42.010 --> 00:39:44.380
passed from the left subtree
to the right subtree.

00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:46.630
If r intersect w is
small, then presumably I

00:39:46.630 --> 00:39:49.732
can afford to write it
down, I can encode it.

00:39:49.732 --> 00:39:51.940
So that's what we're going
to do, and we'll compute--

00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:55.350
we'll figure out that this is
indeed something we can afford.

00:39:55.350 --> 00:40:00.050
I'm going to encode r
intersect w explicitly.

00:40:00.050 --> 00:40:05.470
Meaning-- and this is a
set of cells in memory.

00:40:05.470 --> 00:40:07.480
So for every cell, I'm
going to write down

00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:12.310
what it's address is, and what
the contents of the cell are.

00:40:12.310 --> 00:40:18.850
So write down the
addresses and the contents

00:40:18.850 --> 00:40:20.720
for every such cell.

00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:23.830
So how many bits does that take?

00:40:23.830 --> 00:40:30.115
I'm going to say that it's r
intersect w times log n bits.

00:40:33.250 --> 00:40:35.830
Here's where I need to
mention an assumption.

00:40:35.830 --> 00:40:39.920
I'm assuming that the address
space is order log n bits long,

00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:42.280
that's like saying that the
space of your data structure

00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:44.050
is order--

00:40:44.050 --> 00:40:46.160
is polynomial in n.

00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:49.000
And if you want any hope of
having a reasonable update

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.594
time, you need to have
polynomial space at most.

00:40:51.594 --> 00:40:54.010
So assuming polynomial space,
each of those addresses only

00:40:54.010 --> 00:40:56.140
takes order log n
bits to write down.

00:40:56.140 --> 00:41:00.417
The contents, let's say,
also take order log n bits

00:41:00.417 --> 00:41:01.000
to write down.

00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:08.880
OK, so fine.

00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:12.412
That's-- I mean, yeah.

00:41:12.412 --> 00:41:14.370
We don't really need to
make those assumptions,

00:41:14.370 --> 00:41:20.140
I don't think, but we will for
here to keep things simple.

00:41:20.140 --> 00:41:22.740
So if r intersect w is
small, meaning smaller

00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:28.470
than this thing, then this will
be small, smaller than l root

00:41:28.470 --> 00:41:29.238
log n.

00:41:32.516 --> 00:41:33.450
OK.

00:41:33.450 --> 00:41:38.040
So on the other hand, we know
that every encoding should

00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:41.360
take l root n log n bits.

00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:44.190
And so this will
be a contradiction,

00:41:44.190 --> 00:41:47.670
although we haven't quite
encoded what we need yet,

00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:50.250
or we haven't proved
that, but we're getting

00:41:50.250 --> 00:41:51.390
to be at the right point.

00:41:51.390 --> 00:41:55.890
These log ns are going
to cancel in a moment.

00:41:55.890 --> 00:41:59.010
So what we need to do is,
I claim this is actually

00:41:59.010 --> 00:42:00.790
enough to encode what we need.

00:42:00.790 --> 00:42:10.100
And so all that's left is a
decoding algorithm for the sum

00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:12.970
queries in the right subtree.

00:42:20.710 --> 00:42:22.960
So how are we going to do that?

00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:24.750
So this is my encoding,
these are the bits

00:42:24.750 --> 00:42:26.340
that I have written down.

00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:29.580
So now what I
know, as a decoder,

00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:32.590
is I know everything
about the past.

00:42:32.590 --> 00:42:34.390
I don't know what
these updates are,

00:42:34.390 --> 00:42:36.600
that's my whole goal, to
figure out what they are.

00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:38.730
I don't know what the
results of the queries

00:42:38.730 --> 00:42:41.050
are, but magically, I
know that r intersect w.

00:42:41.050 --> 00:42:42.030
Well, not magically.

00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:45.670
I wrote it down, kept
track on a piece of paper.

00:42:45.670 --> 00:42:47.580
So that's what I know.

00:42:47.580 --> 00:42:51.030
And so the idea
is, well, somebody

00:42:51.030 --> 00:42:53.550
gave us a data structure,
tells you how to do an update,

00:42:53.550 --> 00:42:55.090
tells you how to do a query.

00:42:55.090 --> 00:42:58.557
Let's run the query
algorithms over here.

00:42:58.557 --> 00:43:00.390
Run that query, run
that query, or whatever.

00:43:03.270 --> 00:43:05.310
It's a little hard to
run them, because we

00:43:05.310 --> 00:43:08.130
don't know what happened
in this intermediate part.

00:43:08.130 --> 00:43:12.430
But I claim r intersect w tells
us everything we need to know.

00:43:12.430 --> 00:43:23.220
So the decoding algorithm is
just simulate sum queries,

00:43:23.220 --> 00:43:24.942
simulate that algorithm.

00:43:35.780 --> 00:43:38.380
And let's go up here.

00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:55.680
How do we simulate
that algorithm?

00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:58.870
Well, the algorithm
makes a series of cell

00:43:58.870 --> 00:44:03.580
reads, and maybe writes, but
really we care about the reads.

00:44:03.580 --> 00:44:05.565
Writes are pretty
easy to simulate.

00:44:21.590 --> 00:44:23.470
There are three cases for reads.

00:44:23.470 --> 00:44:25.870
It could be that the thing
you're trying to read

00:44:25.870 --> 00:44:27.340
was written in
the right subtree,

00:44:27.340 --> 00:44:29.650
it could be that it was
written in the left subtree,

00:44:29.650 --> 00:44:31.730
or it could be it was
written in the past,

00:44:31.730 --> 00:44:36.177
before we got to v subtree.

00:44:36.177 --> 00:44:38.260
Now we don't necessarily
know which case we're in,

00:44:38.260 --> 00:44:40.890
but I claim we'll be
able to figure it out.

00:44:40.890 --> 00:44:45.789
Because any cells that are
written in the right subtree,

00:44:45.789 --> 00:44:47.830
we've just been running
the simulation algorithm,

00:44:47.830 --> 00:44:50.140
so every time we do
it right, we just

00:44:50.140 --> 00:44:51.460
can store it off to the side.

00:44:51.460 --> 00:44:54.250
So when we're doing
simulations, we

00:44:54.250 --> 00:44:57.100
don't need that the
simulation takes low space.

00:44:57.100 --> 00:44:59.750
We just need that the input--
these decoding algorithms

00:44:59.750 --> 00:45:01.291
doesn't have to be
low space, we just

00:45:01.291 --> 00:45:02.830
need that the
encoding was small.

00:45:02.830 --> 00:45:05.010
We've already made
the encoding small.

00:45:05.010 --> 00:45:06.400
And so the decoding
algorithm can

00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:08.290
spend lots of time
and space, we just

00:45:08.290 --> 00:45:10.540
need to show that decoding
algorithm can recover

00:45:10.540 --> 00:45:11.790
what it's supposed to recover.

00:45:11.790 --> 00:45:13.430
It's like a
compression algorithm,

00:45:13.430 --> 00:45:15.160
to show there's some
way to decompress,

00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:17.160
could take arbitrarily
amount of time and space.

00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:20.020
So when we're simulating
the right subtree,

00:45:20.020 --> 00:45:23.725
and we simulate not only the sum
queries, but also the updates.

00:45:27.370 --> 00:45:30.100
So whatever gets written
during that simulation,

00:45:30.100 --> 00:45:33.610
we just store it, and so
it's easy to reread it.

00:45:33.610 --> 00:45:36.250
If it was written
in the left subtree,

00:45:36.250 --> 00:45:38.245
well, that is r intersect w.

00:45:40.990 --> 00:45:42.910
And we've written
down r intersect w.

00:45:42.910 --> 00:45:44.470
So we can detect
that this happened,

00:45:44.470 --> 00:45:47.000
because we look
at r intersect w,

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:48.970
we see, oh that
word was in there,

00:45:48.970 --> 00:45:51.220
that address was
in there, and so

00:45:51.220 --> 00:45:55.120
we read the contents
from the encoding.

00:45:55.120 --> 00:46:00.420
If it was in the
past, it's also easy.

00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:03.100
We already know it.

00:46:03.100 --> 00:46:07.690
OK, so basically what we do--

00:46:07.690 --> 00:46:09.880
what the simulation algorithm
is doing is it says,

00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:12.460
OK, let's assume
that main memory was

00:46:12.460 --> 00:46:14.477
whatever it was at this point.

00:46:14.477 --> 00:46:17.060
That data structure, I mean we
know everything about the past,

00:46:17.060 --> 00:46:18.768
so we know what the
data structure looked

00:46:18.768 --> 00:46:20.710
like at this moment, store that.

00:46:20.710 --> 00:46:23.530
Update all of the cells
that are in r intersect

00:46:23.530 --> 00:46:26.050
w given by our encoding.

00:46:26.050 --> 00:46:28.520
And then just run the algorithm.

00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:31.480
So we're sort of jumping
into this moment in time

00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:34.360
with a slightly
weird data structure.

00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:37.244
It's not the correct
data structure.

00:46:37.244 --> 00:46:39.160
It's not what the data
structure will actually

00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:41.470
look like at this point,
but it's close enough.

00:46:41.470 --> 00:46:44.530
Because anything
that's read here,

00:46:44.530 --> 00:46:46.300
either was written
here, in which case

00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:48.960
it's correct, or was
written here, in which case

00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:53.250
it's correct because
r intersect w had it.

00:46:53.250 --> 00:46:56.290
Or isn't it written
here, in which case--

00:46:56.290 --> 00:46:59.060
maybe it's always correct.

00:46:59.060 --> 00:46:59.560
No, no.

00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:01.120
See there could be
some writes that

00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:04.397
happened here, where there's no
corresponding read over here.

00:47:04.397 --> 00:47:06.730
So the data structure may
have been changed in ways here

00:47:06.730 --> 00:47:10.430
that don't matter for this
execution of the right subtree.

00:47:10.430 --> 00:47:13.300
So any rights that happened
here to some cell probe,

00:47:13.300 --> 00:47:15.496
to some cell, where that
cell is not read over here,

00:47:15.496 --> 00:47:16.870
we don't care
about, because they

00:47:16.870 --> 00:47:18.820
don't affect the simulation.

00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:20.830
So we have a good
enough data structure

00:47:20.830 --> 00:47:23.440
here, it may not be
completely accurate,

00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:26.170
but it's accurate enough
to run these queries.

00:47:26.170 --> 00:47:28.760
Once we run the queries,
the queries output the sums.

00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:31.450
That's what we're assuming in
this warm up, we run the query,

00:47:31.450 --> 00:47:33.160
we get the sum.

00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:35.302
Once I have that sum,
as I argued before,

00:47:35.302 --> 00:47:37.510
once you know what the
results of these queries were,

00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:41.680
I can figure out what the
arguments to the updates were,

00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:44.810
by doing that inverse
multiplication stuff.

00:47:44.810 --> 00:47:47.090
So that's actually it.

00:47:47.090 --> 00:47:51.650
What this implies is that this
is a correct encoding, which

00:47:51.650 --> 00:47:56.360
means that this order,
r intersect w times log

00:47:56.360 --> 00:48:02.690
n bits that we use to encode,
must be at least this big.

00:48:02.690 --> 00:48:04.580
Because we know any
encoding is going

00:48:04.580 --> 00:48:10.005
to require at least that
many bits, l root n log n.

00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:16.280
And so the log ns
cancel, and we're

00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:20.060
left with r intersect
w is at least l root n.

00:48:20.060 --> 00:48:24.102
And this is exactly the quantity
we cared about for this claim.

00:48:24.102 --> 00:48:29.450
So same thing, r intersect
w is at least l root n.

00:48:29.450 --> 00:48:31.090
OK, so warm up done.

00:48:31.090 --> 00:48:33.960
Any questions about the warm up?

00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:35.870
So in this weird
problem, which does not

00:48:35.870 --> 00:48:39.040
correspond to
dynamic connectivity,

00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:43.190
because it's this other problem,
prefix sums computation.

00:48:43.190 --> 00:48:46.190
We get the intended lower bound,
you need log n per operation.

00:48:46.190 --> 00:48:50.710
Or you need root n log
n per block operation.

00:48:50.710 --> 00:48:52.670
OK, but this is not
what we really want,

00:48:52.670 --> 00:48:55.490
we really want a lower
bound on verify sum.

00:48:55.490 --> 00:48:59.060
Where you're given as an
argument the permutation that

00:48:59.060 --> 00:49:00.980
we're talking about over here.

00:49:00.980 --> 00:49:06.170
So this goal is not the
right goal for verify sum,

00:49:06.170 --> 00:49:07.040
in some sense.

00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:08.675
Well, sort of the right goal.

00:49:08.675 --> 00:49:10.550
It's a little awkward
though, because they're

00:49:10.550 --> 00:49:12.980
given as inputs to the queries.

00:49:12.980 --> 00:49:17.240
So what is there to encode?

00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:21.230
Well, we can still set
it up in a useful way.

00:49:21.230 --> 00:49:23.650
Same goal, slightly restated.

00:49:42.230 --> 00:49:46.200
So this is the last step
to verify sum lower bound.

00:50:06.830 --> 00:50:08.232
So here's the set up.

00:51:05.010 --> 00:51:07.190
OK, so slightly
different set up here.

00:51:07.190 --> 00:51:10.670
Here I assumed that
we just knew the past.

00:51:10.670 --> 00:51:13.250
I also basically assumed
these two things,

00:51:13.250 --> 00:51:16.814
that we didn't know what
the update permutations were

00:51:16.814 --> 00:51:18.230
in the left subtree,
and we didn't

00:51:18.230 --> 00:51:20.090
know what the answers
to the queries

00:51:20.090 --> 00:51:21.609
were in the right subtree.

00:51:21.609 --> 00:51:23.150
Now I'm going to
assume we don't even

00:51:23.150 --> 00:51:25.100
know what we're passing
into the queries,

00:51:25.100 --> 00:51:27.860
because that is the information
we're trying to figure out.

00:51:27.860 --> 00:51:29.630
These two things are
basically the same,

00:51:29.630 --> 00:51:31.381
if you knew all the
update permutations,

00:51:31.381 --> 00:51:33.380
you could figure out all
the query permutations.

00:51:33.380 --> 00:51:35.060
If you knew all the
query permutations,

00:51:35.060 --> 00:51:37.101
you could figure out all
the update permutations.

00:51:37.101 --> 00:51:39.590
That's what we argued
over here, it's

00:51:39.590 --> 00:51:43.520
enough to figure out
query permutations,

00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:46.070
then we could figure out
the update permutations.

00:51:46.070 --> 00:51:49.410
It's just a little more
awkward, because now there

00:51:49.410 --> 00:51:50.900
are arguments to queries.

00:51:50.900 --> 00:51:53.336
And so if we did this
simulation, right?

00:51:53.336 --> 00:51:54.710
We'd simulate--
we don't know how

00:51:54.710 --> 00:51:57.251
to simulate the query algorithm,
because it's supposed to be,

00:51:57.251 --> 00:51:59.300
given the argument,
which is what

00:51:59.300 --> 00:52:01.294
we're trying to figure out.

00:52:01.294 --> 00:52:06.460
So we can't simulate
the query algorithm.

00:52:06.460 --> 00:52:08.440
It's kind of annoying,
but otherwise

00:52:08.440 --> 00:52:10.166
the set up is roughly the same.

00:52:10.166 --> 00:52:11.790
The one thing we know
is that the query

00:52:11.790 --> 00:52:15.130
is supposed to return
yes, because if you

00:52:15.130 --> 00:52:17.620
look at this bad
access sequence,

00:52:17.620 --> 00:52:20.980
it is designed to
always return yes.

00:52:20.980 --> 00:52:24.855
So that is a thing we know,
but we don't know the arguments

00:52:24.855 --> 00:52:26.980
to the updates on the left,
we don't know arguments

00:52:26.980 --> 00:52:28.240
to the updates on the right.

00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:29.781
We'll assume we know
everything else,

00:52:29.781 --> 00:52:31.630
basically, up to this time.

00:52:31.630 --> 00:52:33.940
Again, this is a
probabilistic statement,

00:52:33.940 --> 00:52:38.410
that conditioned on the past,
conditioned on the queries

00:52:38.410 --> 00:52:40.210
on the left, which
probably don't matter,

00:52:40.210 --> 00:52:43.480
conditioned on the updates on
the right, which do matter,

00:52:43.480 --> 00:52:46.900
but they're sort of irrelevant
to this r intersect w issue.

00:52:46.900 --> 00:52:48.400
Conditioned on all
those things will

00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:51.400
prove that the expected number
of operations you need to--

00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:55.510
or expected encoding
size, for this problem,

00:52:55.510 --> 00:52:58.750
is at least what it is,
l root n log n bits.

00:52:58.750 --> 00:53:01.720
And from that lower
bound, you can then

00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:06.640
take the sum over all possible
setups, over all conditions.

00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:09.580
And that implies a lower
bound on the overall setting

00:53:09.580 --> 00:53:12.088
without these assumptions.

00:53:12.088 --> 00:53:13.520
OK?

00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:16.630
So all I'm saying
is in this set up,

00:53:16.630 --> 00:53:19.236
it still takes a lot of bits
to encode these updates,

00:53:19.236 --> 00:53:20.860
because we don't have
the queries which

00:53:20.860 --> 00:53:22.587
would tell us the answers.

00:53:22.587 --> 00:53:24.670
So we get a lower bound
on encoding these updates,

00:53:24.670 --> 00:53:26.290
or a lower bound on
encoding these queries,

00:53:26.290 --> 00:53:27.944
because we assume
we don't know them.

00:53:27.944 --> 00:53:29.860
The rest of the-- all
the remaining operations

00:53:29.860 --> 00:53:34.320
don't tell us enough about this.

00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:35.720
OK.

00:53:35.720 --> 00:53:37.790
So how the heck are
we going to do--

00:53:37.790 --> 00:53:40.730
prove a lower bound in
this setting, when we can't

00:53:40.730 --> 00:53:43.624
simulate the query algorithm?

00:53:43.624 --> 00:53:45.290
There's one cool idea
to make this work.

00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:55.050
You may recall our last
cell probe lower bound

00:53:55.050 --> 00:53:56.340
for the predecessor problem.

00:54:00.570 --> 00:54:03.150
Use this idea of
round elimination.

00:54:03.150 --> 00:54:06.190
The idea with round
elimination was--

00:54:06.190 --> 00:54:09.470
Alice is sending a message,
Bob was sending a response.

00:54:09.470 --> 00:54:11.300
But that first m--
we set things up,

00:54:11.300 --> 00:54:14.240
we set up the problem so the
first message sent by Alice

00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:18.350
had, on average, less than
1-bit of information to Bob,

00:54:18.350 --> 00:54:20.120
or very little
information to Bob.

00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:23.120
And so what Bob could
do is basically guess

00:54:23.120 --> 00:54:24.800
what that message was.

00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:27.470
And that would be accurate
with some probability.

00:54:27.470 --> 00:54:28.910
Now here, we're
not quite allowed

00:54:28.910 --> 00:54:30.050
to do that, we're
not allowed to change

00:54:30.050 --> 00:54:31.550
the accuracy of our
results, because

00:54:31.550 --> 00:54:33.860
of our particular setting.

00:54:33.860 --> 00:54:38.600
So we can't afford to just
guess by flipping coins

00:54:38.600 --> 00:54:41.510
what we were supposed to know.

00:54:41.510 --> 00:54:43.340
What we're supposed
to know here is--

00:54:43.340 --> 00:54:45.470
we're trying to simulate
a query operation,

00:54:45.470 --> 00:54:46.970
and so we need to
know the argument,

00:54:46.970 --> 00:54:48.760
that whole permutation
to the queries.

00:54:48.760 --> 00:54:50.950
It's hard to run it
without that permutation.

00:54:50.950 --> 00:54:52.880
So instead of guessing
by flipping coins,

00:54:52.880 --> 00:54:54.920
we're going to guess in
the dynamic programming

00:54:54.920 --> 00:54:58.310
sense, which is we're going
to try all the possibilities.

00:54:58.310 --> 00:55:02.990
Run the simulation over
all possible queries,

00:55:02.990 --> 00:55:05.231
all possible second
arguments to the query.

00:55:05.231 --> 00:55:06.980
We don't know what the
presentation is, so

00:55:06.980 --> 00:55:08.480
just try them all.

00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:14.180
Cool thing is, only one
argument here should return yes.

00:55:14.180 --> 00:55:16.710
That's the one
we're looking for.

00:55:16.710 --> 00:55:18.140
So if you try them
all, find which

00:55:18.140 --> 00:55:21.844
one says yes, we'll be done.

00:55:21.844 --> 00:55:25.670
So this is called
the decoding idea.

00:55:31.460 --> 00:55:45.240
Simulate verify sum of
i comma pi, for all pi.

00:55:45.240 --> 00:55:48.794
And take the one that returns
yes, that is our permutation.

00:55:48.794 --> 00:55:51.210
And so if we figure out what
those query permutations are,

00:55:51.210 --> 00:55:53.376
then we figure out what the
update permutations are,

00:55:53.376 --> 00:55:57.360
and we get our lower
bounds just like before.

00:55:57.360 --> 00:55:59.940
OK.

00:55:59.940 --> 00:56:02.940
This is easier said than
done, unfortunately.

00:56:02.940 --> 00:56:08.446
We'd like to run the
simulation just like here, so

00:56:08.446 --> 00:56:09.570
simulate inquiry algorithm.

00:56:09.570 --> 00:56:11.669
They said, OK, still
the case, that if you're

00:56:11.669 --> 00:56:13.710
reading a cell that's
either in the left subtree,

00:56:13.710 --> 00:56:16.800
in the right subtree,
or in the past.

00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:19.680
And we said this was
easy, this was known.

00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:25.260
And the hard part is this
case, because if we're

00:56:25.260 --> 00:56:28.320
running this query,
and it reads something

00:56:28.320 --> 00:56:30.090
that was written in
the left subtree,

00:56:30.090 --> 00:56:33.600
it may not be in r intersect w.

00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:35.894
Why is that?

00:56:35.894 --> 00:56:36.810
Little puzzle for you.

00:56:39.810 --> 00:56:42.670
So we're running one of
these queries for sum pi.

00:56:42.670 --> 00:56:45.430
And I claim that when we read
something in the left subtree,

00:56:45.430 --> 00:56:49.422
we don't know if it's in r
intersect w, it might not be.

00:56:59.754 --> 00:57:01.360
Let's see if we're
on the same page.

00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:07.640
So r is the set of cells
read during the right subtree

00:57:07.640 --> 00:57:11.740
when executing these operations.

00:57:11.740 --> 00:57:12.240
OK?

00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:16.180
But what we're doing now is
simulating some executions

00:57:16.180 --> 00:57:19.210
that didn't necessarily happen.

00:57:19.210 --> 00:57:21.400
We're doing a verify
sum of i comma pi,

00:57:21.400 --> 00:57:23.260
but in the bad
access sequence, we

00:57:23.260 --> 00:57:24.910
did verify sum of
i comma something

00:57:24.910 --> 00:57:28.150
specific, not any pi,
but the correct pi.

00:57:28.150 --> 00:57:31.420
So we only ran the
yes verify sums,

00:57:31.420 --> 00:57:33.910
and that's what r is
defined with respect to.

00:57:33.910 --> 00:57:35.410
r is the set of
things that get read

00:57:35.410 --> 00:57:38.050
during these operations,
where the verify sum is always

00:57:38.050 --> 00:57:38.590
output yes.

00:57:38.590 --> 00:57:42.070
If you now run a verify
sum where the answer is no,

00:57:42.070 --> 00:57:46.390
it may read stuff that the other
verify sum didn't read maybe.

00:57:46.390 --> 00:57:48.820
Shouldn't matter,
but it's awkward,

00:57:48.820 --> 00:57:51.890
because now it's not just r
intersect w we need to encode.

00:57:51.890 --> 00:57:55.630
We need to encode
some more stuff.

00:57:55.630 --> 00:57:57.760
It's basically a
new r prime that

00:57:57.760 --> 00:58:01.180
may happen during these
reads, and we just

00:58:01.180 --> 00:58:02.680
can't afford to
encode that r prime,

00:58:02.680 --> 00:58:04.388
because it's not the
thing we care about.

00:58:04.388 --> 00:58:06.880
We care about what happens in
the actual access sequence,

00:58:06.880 --> 00:58:10.130
not in this
arbitrary simulation.

00:58:10.130 --> 00:58:15.361
So this is the annoying thing.

00:58:15.361 --> 00:58:15.860
Trouble.

00:58:21.700 --> 00:58:28.780
If you look at an incorrect
query, meaning the wrong pi,

00:58:28.780 --> 00:58:33.930
this is like a no
query, the output's no.

00:58:33.930 --> 00:58:39.040
Reads some different
set of cells, r

00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:42.770
prime, which isn't
the same thing as r.

00:58:42.770 --> 00:58:49.300
And so if-- we have
some good news, which

00:58:49.300 --> 00:58:52.150
is if we can somehow
detect that this happened,

00:58:52.150 --> 00:58:58.270
that we read something that
is in r prime, but not r,

00:58:58.270 --> 00:59:00.880
then the answer must be no.

00:59:05.950 --> 00:59:11.019
So that's our saving
hope, is that either we're

00:59:11.019 --> 00:59:13.060
reading something at r
intersect w, in which case

00:59:13.060 --> 00:59:15.460
it's been written down,
we know how to do it.

00:59:15.460 --> 00:59:20.230
What's not written there, and
if it's not written there,

00:59:20.230 --> 00:59:23.950
then it should be, hopefully,
in r prime minus r.

00:59:23.950 --> 00:59:27.320
So the answer should be no.

00:59:27.320 --> 00:59:29.620
Maybe.

00:59:29.620 --> 00:59:31.330
Slight problem,
though, because we

00:59:31.330 --> 00:59:34.780
used r intersect w to
detect what case we were in.

00:59:34.780 --> 00:59:36.610
If we were in r
intersect w, then

00:59:36.610 --> 00:59:40.160
we knew we should read
from those encoded cells.

00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:43.810
If we weren't, we were either
in the past or in the right

00:59:43.810 --> 00:59:45.850
subtree, these things
were easy to detect,

00:59:45.850 --> 00:59:48.850
because they got written
during the simulation.

00:59:48.850 --> 00:59:50.580
But we need to
distinguish between--

00:59:50.580 --> 00:59:52.780
did we read something that
was in the left subtree,

00:59:52.780 --> 00:59:56.710
or did we read something
that was known?

00:59:56.710 --> 00:59:59.440
This is a little tricky, because
this gets at exactly the issue.

00:59:59.440 --> 01:00:01.390
Left subtree might
write some stuff that

01:00:01.390 --> 01:00:04.330
didn't get read by verify sum.

01:00:04.330 --> 01:00:07.790
So now you go to read
it, you need to know,

01:00:07.790 --> 01:00:12.610
am I reading something that
was not in r intersect w?

01:00:12.610 --> 01:00:18.130
And therefore-- Yeah.

01:00:18.130 --> 01:00:21.270
Basically the issue
is, is it in w?

01:00:21.270 --> 01:00:23.480
If it's in w, but
not in r intersect w,

01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:26.320
then I know the answer
is no, and I should stop.

01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:30.450
If it's not in w though, that
means it was in the known past,

01:00:30.450 --> 01:00:32.500
and then I should continue.

01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:35.320
How do I know if I
should stop or continue?

01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:41.030
So this is the tricky part.

01:00:41.030 --> 01:00:49.730
We can't tell whether
there's the weird notation.

01:00:49.730 --> 01:00:58.240
We want to know whether r is
in w minus r or past minus r

01:00:58.240 --> 01:01:00.400
intersect w.

01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:02.994
OK, we can tell whether
it's in r intersect w,

01:01:02.994 --> 01:01:03.910
if it is, we're happy.

01:01:03.910 --> 01:01:06.100
If it's not in r
intersect w, it could

01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:08.490
be that's because it was
just in some past thing we

01:01:08.490 --> 01:01:12.340
were reading, that didn't
get read otherwise.

01:01:12.340 --> 01:01:14.590
Or it could be we're
reading something

01:01:14.590 --> 01:01:16.720
that was written in
the left subtree,

01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:18.770
but not read in
the right subtree.

01:01:18.770 --> 01:01:21.850
So in this case,
we want to abort.

01:01:21.850 --> 01:01:25.735
And in this case, it's known,
and so we just continue.

01:01:30.322 --> 01:01:32.280
So that's what the
simulation would like to do,

01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:35.292
if we could distinguish
between these two cases.

01:01:35.292 --> 01:01:37.500
But right now, we can't
distinguish between these two

01:01:37.500 --> 01:01:40.600
cases, because we don't
have enough information.

01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:44.240
So we're going to make our
encoding a little bit bigger.

01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:45.240
What we're going to do--

01:01:48.888 --> 01:02:06.030
this is here-- is
encode a separator

01:02:06.030 --> 01:02:15.736
for r minus w and w minus r.

01:02:15.736 --> 01:02:21.130
So let's-- over here.

01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:38.280
What does this mean?

01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:45.030
Separators going to call, called
S. So I want this picture,

01:02:45.030 --> 01:02:52.420
r minus w sits inside
S. And w minus r

01:02:52.420 --> 01:02:59.327
sits outside S. This is
my universe of cells.

01:02:59.327 --> 01:03:01.660
These are the things that are
read in the right subtree,

01:03:01.660 --> 01:03:03.742
but not written in
the left subtree.

01:03:03.742 --> 01:03:05.200
Those are the things
I care about--

01:03:07.870 --> 01:03:10.390
well, no quite this,
the other ones.

01:03:10.390 --> 01:03:13.210
So things that are read in
the right subtree and that

01:03:13.210 --> 01:03:16.840
are not written in the last,
this is the past essentially,

01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:18.820
that's useful over there.

01:03:18.820 --> 01:03:22.190
Over here, I have
w minus r, these

01:03:22.190 --> 01:03:24.190
are things that are written
in the left subtree,

01:03:24.190 --> 01:03:25.690
but not read in
the right subtree.

01:03:25.690 --> 01:03:27.356
These are the things
that I worry about,

01:03:27.356 --> 01:03:29.830
because those ones I need to
detect that that was changed,

01:03:29.830 --> 01:03:35.510
and say whoops, you must
have an answer of no.

01:03:35.510 --> 01:03:36.010
OK?

01:03:36.010 --> 01:03:38.557
So I can't afford to
store these sets exactly,

01:03:38.557 --> 01:03:40.390
so I'm going to approximate
them, by saying,

01:03:40.390 --> 01:03:43.840
well, let's store the
separator out here.

01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:49.000
And if you're in S, then you're
definitely not in w minus r.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:53.470
If you're definitely not in
w minus r, then you can run--

01:03:53.470 --> 01:03:56.290
you can treat it
as if it was known.

01:03:56.290 --> 01:04:00.080
OK, so if you're in
s, this would be--

01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:03.240
why don't I write it here.

01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:05.200
For the decoding
algorithm, if you

01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:14.730
want to read a cell
that is written,

01:04:14.730 --> 01:04:24.160
or last written in the
right subtree, in the past,

01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:27.870
these are the two easy case.

01:04:27.870 --> 01:04:30.350
Sorry-- I don't want to
write what's in the past,

01:04:30.350 --> 01:04:33.080
because the whole point is to
figure out what's in the past.

01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:35.360
The other easy case is
if it's in r intersect w,

01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:37.332
then it's written down for us.

01:04:37.332 --> 01:04:38.365
So this is encoded.

01:04:40.930 --> 01:04:45.280
This is easy, because during the
simulation we did those rights,

01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:46.870
and so we know what they were.

01:04:46.870 --> 01:04:50.020
r intersect w, we've written
down, so it's easy to know.

01:04:50.020 --> 01:04:52.600
Then the other cases
are either you're in S,

01:04:52.600 --> 01:05:00.790
or you're not in S. OK.

01:05:00.790 --> 01:05:05.800
I claim if you're in S,
you must be in the past,

01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:09.340
that cell must have been
written in the past,

01:05:09.340 --> 01:05:13.120
and so you know
what the value was.

01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:15.550
And so you can continue
writing the simulation,

01:05:15.550 --> 01:05:17.474
just like in this situation.

01:05:19.830 --> 01:05:22.330
The other situation is you're
not in S, then you don't know,

01:05:22.330 --> 01:05:24.820
it could have been written
or might not have been.

01:05:24.820 --> 01:05:30.180
But what you know is that
you're definitely not in r.

01:05:30.180 --> 01:05:32.100
Because if you're
not in r minus w,

01:05:32.100 --> 01:05:36.050
and you're not in r intersect
w, then you're not in r.

01:05:36.050 --> 01:05:41.060
If you're not in r, then
we're in this situation.

01:05:41.060 --> 01:05:42.810
If you read something
not in r, that means

01:05:42.810 --> 01:05:45.150
you're running the wrong query.

01:05:45.150 --> 01:05:47.850
Because the correct
query does r--

01:05:47.850 --> 01:05:49.590
only reads from r.

01:05:49.590 --> 01:05:56.970
So if you're not an S,
you must not be in r.

01:05:56.970 --> 01:06:01.560
And so in this case, you
know you can abort and try

01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:02.660
the next pi.

01:06:02.660 --> 01:06:04.890
So we're going to do
this for all pi, run

01:06:04.890 --> 01:06:09.194
the simulation according to
this way of reading cells.

01:06:09.194 --> 01:06:11.610
At the end, the queries are
either going to say yes or no,

01:06:11.610 --> 01:06:16.950
or it may abort early.

01:06:16.950 --> 01:06:18.840
So if it says no
or it aborts early,

01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:21.360
then we know that
was not the right pi.

01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:24.960
Only one of them can say yes,
that tells us what the pi is,

01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:27.810
that tells us what
the queries were.

01:06:27.810 --> 01:06:30.240
Once we know what the queries
were in the right subtree,

01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:33.012
we can use the same
multiplying by inverses trick,

01:06:33.012 --> 01:06:35.220
figure out what the updates
were in the left subtree.

01:06:35.220 --> 01:06:41.250
But those permutations
require l root n log n bits.

01:06:41.250 --> 01:06:43.770
Which used to be on this
board, it's been erased now.

01:06:43.770 --> 01:06:46.470
That's what we use
for this argument.

01:06:46.470 --> 01:06:48.270
And so what we get
is overall, encoding

01:06:48.270 --> 01:06:52.822
must use l root n log n bits.

01:06:52.822 --> 01:06:55.740
OK, but our encoding's
a little bit bigger now.

01:06:55.740 --> 01:06:59.190
The big issue is how do
we store the separator?

01:06:59.190 --> 01:07:01.860
We need to do store this
separator with very few bits,

01:07:01.860 --> 01:07:06.160
otherwise we haven't
really proved anything.

01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:07.800
We want encoding to be small.

01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:19.320
So we get that the
encoding must use

01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:28.170
omega l root n log n bits
in expectation, because this

01:07:28.170 --> 01:07:30.630
is a valid decoding
algorithm, it will figure out

01:07:30.630 --> 01:07:32.422
what the permutations were.

01:07:32.422 --> 01:07:34.130
And they require at
least this many bits,

01:07:34.130 --> 01:07:38.160
so encoding must use this
many bits in expectation.

01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:40.740
Now the question is how many
bits does the encoding use?

01:07:40.740 --> 01:07:42.360
Then we'll get either
a contradiction

01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:44.550
or we'll prove the claim.

01:07:47.142 --> 01:07:48.960
So let's go over here.

01:08:23.830 --> 01:08:27.330
So here's a fun fact
about separators.

01:08:27.330 --> 01:08:30.779
I'm not going to prove
it fully, but I'm

01:08:30.779 --> 01:08:33.792
going to rely on
some hashing ability.

01:08:36.630 --> 01:08:38.790
So given some universe
U, in this case

01:08:38.790 --> 01:08:42.270
it's going to be the cells
in our data structure.

01:08:42.270 --> 01:08:44.715
But speak a little bit more
generally of the universe U,

01:08:44.715 --> 01:08:47.800
I have some number m,
which is our set size.

01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:53.580
And what we're interested in
is in defining our separator

01:08:53.580 --> 01:08:54.960
family.

01:08:54.960 --> 01:08:58.930
Kind of like a family of hash
functions, closely related,

01:08:58.930 --> 01:08:59.790
in fact.

01:08:59.790 --> 01:09:07.320
Call it S. And it's going
to work for size m sets.

01:09:13.510 --> 01:09:20.229
And so S is a separator family
if, for any two sets, A and B,

01:09:20.229 --> 01:09:32.259
in the universe of size,
at most, m, and disjoint.

01:09:32.259 --> 01:09:35.529
So A intersect B
is the empty set.

01:09:35.529 --> 01:09:38.380
So of course what we're thinking
about here is r minus w,

01:09:38.380 --> 01:09:39.279
and w minus r.

01:09:39.279 --> 01:09:41.380
These are two subsets
of the universe.

01:09:41.380 --> 01:09:44.510
Hopefully they're not too big,
because if this one is huge,

01:09:44.510 --> 01:09:46.240
that means you read
a huge amount of data

01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:47.080
in the right subtree.

01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:49.621
If this one is huge, it meant
you wrote a huge amount of data

01:09:49.621 --> 01:09:50.960
in the left subtree.

01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:53.770
And then we get lower
bounds in an easier way.

01:09:53.770 --> 01:09:56.550
Or they're not so big, let's
say they're size at most m.

01:09:56.550 --> 01:09:59.470
They're disjoint for sure,
by definition, r minus w's

01:09:59.470 --> 01:10:01.110
disjoint from w minus r.

01:10:01.110 --> 01:10:02.983
It removes the intersection.

01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:08.760
So that's our set up.

01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:10.390
Then, what we
want, is that there

01:10:10.390 --> 01:10:15.580
is some set C in the
separator family,

01:10:15.580 --> 01:10:29.590
such that A is contained in
C, and B is outside of C.

01:10:29.590 --> 01:10:33.580
So B is in the universe minus C.
So this is exactly our picture

01:10:33.580 --> 01:10:38.890
from before, we have
A. A contains C,

01:10:38.890 --> 01:10:41.230
and we have B over on the right.

01:10:41.230 --> 01:10:45.840
And this is the whole universe
U, and so B is outside of C,

01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:51.832
A is entirely inside C. OK.

01:10:51.832 --> 01:10:54.040
This is what we want to
exist, because if a separator

01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:58.090
family exists, then we know
whatever our r minus w, and w

01:10:58.090 --> 01:11:00.630
minus r sets were, as long
as they're not too big,

01:11:00.630 --> 01:11:02.320
they're definitely
disjoint, we can

01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:05.170
find one of these separators
that encodes what we need

01:11:05.170 --> 01:11:10.930
to encode, which is the set C.
Which is called s over there.

01:11:10.930 --> 01:11:11.740
Cool.

01:11:11.740 --> 01:11:12.640
How do we encode it?

01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:14.240
Well, if the number--

01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:20.260
if the size of the separator
family is something,

01:11:20.260 --> 01:11:24.640
then we need log of that bits
to write down the separator set.

01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:28.490
So as long as this is
small, we're happy.

01:11:28.490 --> 01:11:50.150
So let me tell you what's
to know about separators

01:11:50.150 --> 01:12:02.450
There exists a separator family
S, with size of S at most 2

01:12:02.450 --> 01:12:09.497
to the order m
plus log log U. Now

01:12:09.497 --> 01:12:11.330
this is getting into
an area that we haven't

01:12:11.330 --> 01:12:13.740
spent a lot of time on, but--

01:12:13.740 --> 01:12:15.170
so I'm going to
give you a sketch

01:12:15.170 --> 01:12:16.211
of a proof of this claim.

01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:22.910
Relying on perfect
hash functions.

01:12:22.910 --> 01:12:27.170
So the idea is the following,
we want to know, basically,

01:12:27.170 --> 01:12:30.070
which elements are in A,
which elements are in B.

01:12:30.070 --> 01:12:32.270
But it's kind of annoying
to do that, it can't start

01:12:32.270 --> 01:12:34.290
that for all universe elements.

01:12:34.290 --> 01:12:37.235
So if we could just find a
nice perfect hash function that

01:12:37.235 --> 01:12:39.110
maps the elements of a
and the elements would

01:12:39.110 --> 01:12:40.926
B to different slots
in some hash table,

01:12:40.926 --> 01:12:43.550
then for every slot in the hash
table we could say, is it in A,

01:12:43.550 --> 01:12:45.050
or is it in B?

01:12:45.050 --> 01:12:49.580
Now if you are not in A union
B and you hash somewhere,

01:12:49.580 --> 01:12:52.260
you'll get some bit, who
knows what that that stores.

01:12:52.260 --> 01:12:53.420
I don't care.

01:12:53.420 --> 01:12:55.670
For the things
outside of A union B,

01:12:55.670 --> 01:12:58.580
they could be in C or not
in C, I don't really care.

01:12:58.580 --> 01:13:01.460
And so all I care about
is if A and B have

01:13:01.460 --> 01:13:04.170
no collisions
between each other,

01:13:04.170 --> 01:13:06.650
I don't want any A thing
to hash to B thing.

01:13:06.650 --> 01:13:09.840
Then I can store a bit in
every cell in the hash table,

01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:13.749
and that will tell me, in
particular, A versus B.

01:13:13.749 --> 01:13:16.040
And then the rest of the
items are somehow categorized,

01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:18.350
but I don't care how
they're categorized.

01:13:18.350 --> 01:13:21.710
So we're going to use
this fact that there

01:13:21.710 --> 01:13:28.340
is a set of perfect hash
functions of the same size.

01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:45.680
Sorry, that should be H. This
is what's really true, size of H

01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:51.094
is 2 the order m
plus log log U. OK,

01:13:51.094 --> 01:13:52.760
I'm not going to prove
this, but this is

01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:54.250
about succinct hash functions.

01:13:54.250 --> 01:13:56.450
It may be hard to find
such a hash family,

01:13:56.450 --> 01:13:58.655
but the claim is
that they exist.

01:13:58.655 --> 01:14:01.030
Or it's hard to find the hash
function of the family that

01:14:01.030 --> 01:14:03.200
has no collisions,
but the guarantee

01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:07.580
is, as long as you have,
in total, two items,

01:14:07.580 --> 01:14:10.850
out of your universe
of size U, you

01:14:10.850 --> 01:14:13.160
can get a collision-free
hash function,

01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:17.450
2 to the order m plus log log U.

01:14:17.450 --> 01:14:18.080
OK.

01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:20.630
So this is going to--

01:14:20.630 --> 01:14:21.130
Yeah.

01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:29.900
Maps, say A union B, to
an order m sized table.

01:14:34.040 --> 01:14:36.920
And here, there
are no collisions.

01:14:41.570 --> 01:14:45.680
So then what we also
store is an A or B

01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:51.130
bit for each table entry.

01:15:02.690 --> 01:15:03.970
So that's our encoding.

01:15:03.970 --> 01:15:07.810
We store a perfect
hash function, that's

01:15:07.810 --> 01:15:17.830
going to cost log H bits
for this part, and log of H

01:15:17.830 --> 01:15:20.980
is just m plus log
log U. And then

01:15:20.980 --> 01:15:25.000
we're going to store this A or
B bit for every table entry.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.070
Number of table
entries is order m,

01:15:27.070 --> 01:15:33.430
so this is going to take
2 to the order m bits.

01:15:33.430 --> 01:15:37.029
Or sorry, not-- sorry, in term
of bits, its order m bits,

01:15:37.029 --> 01:15:37.570
I should say.

01:15:40.870 --> 01:15:45.100
In terms of functions,
it's 2 to the order m

01:15:45.100 --> 01:15:48.520
possible choices
for this bit vector.

01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:52.360
And so the easy way is to
just sum up these bits,

01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:54.910
you use log of H bits
plus order m bits.

01:15:54.910 --> 01:15:58.000
This already had an order m
term, and so you get this.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:03.880
The log of S is order
m plus log log U.

01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:06.610
So that's the end of
proof sketch of the claim.

01:16:06.610 --> 01:16:09.010
If you believe perfect hash
functions can be written down

01:16:09.010 --> 01:16:12.100
in a small way, then we're done.

01:16:12.100 --> 01:16:16.060
Now first with separators,
now let's apply this separator

01:16:16.060 --> 01:16:21.280
theorem claim to this setting.

01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:23.530
So now we can compute
the size of our encoding,

01:16:23.530 --> 01:16:26.290
our encoding involved
writing down r intersect w.

01:16:26.290 --> 01:16:30.310
That takes r intersect w
times log n, just like before.

01:16:30.310 --> 01:16:35.050
It also involves writing
down the separator.

01:16:35.050 --> 01:16:40.960
Separator takes order
m bits, m is r plus w.

01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:43.657
Things that are--
it's order r plus w.

01:16:43.657 --> 01:16:44.740
These are all the things--

01:16:44.740 --> 01:16:46.960
I'm trying to write
down r minus w and w

01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:50.090
minus r, so that you add
up those sizes, basically r

01:16:50.090 --> 01:16:51.130
plus w.

01:16:51.130 --> 01:16:57.010
Plus log log U. U
is some small thing,

01:16:57.010 --> 01:17:00.066
size of memory, number
of cells in memory.

01:17:00.066 --> 01:17:01.690
We're assuming that
polynomials, so you

01:17:01.690 --> 01:17:08.270
take log log of a polynomial,
that's like log log n.

01:17:08.270 --> 01:17:10.790
So let's finish this off.

01:17:16.250 --> 01:17:25.790
So before this was our
equation, r intersect w times

01:17:25.790 --> 01:17:27.920
log n, that was the
size of our encoding.

01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:29.050
We still have that term.

01:17:34.110 --> 01:17:40.560
Sorry, r intersect w,
size of that, times log n.

01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:41.860
So we still do that.

01:17:46.600 --> 01:17:50.950
Now we also pay,
for this separator,

01:17:50.950 --> 01:17:57.130
we're going to pay r plus
w, that's the m part.

01:17:57.130 --> 01:18:00.790
Plus log log n.

01:18:00.790 --> 01:18:04.180
This is the number of
bits in our encoding.

01:18:04.180 --> 01:18:07.750
And I claim, or what
we've proved over here,

01:18:07.750 --> 01:18:11.560
is that any encoding must
use l root n log n bits.

01:18:14.340 --> 01:18:17.040
So this thing must be
at least this thing.

01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:19.190
So we have a little
bit more work to prove.

01:18:19.190 --> 01:18:20.870
There are now two cases.

01:18:20.870 --> 01:18:22.600
It depends-- there's basically--

01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:25.760
and log log n is
unlikely to dominate.

01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:29.150
We're doing a block
operation on root n things,

01:18:29.150 --> 01:18:32.480
probably need to use at
least log log n steps.

01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:34.100
So it's not really relevant.

01:18:34.100 --> 01:18:38.930
What will dominate is either
this term, as it used to,

01:18:38.930 --> 01:18:40.500
or this term.

01:18:40.500 --> 01:18:44.450
These are two different cases,
call them case one, case two.

01:18:44.450 --> 01:18:50.930
In case two, r plus w is
at least l root n log n.

01:18:50.930 --> 01:18:52.810
That's the lower bound we want.

01:18:52.810 --> 01:19:02.610
If we can-- in case two, r
plus w is omega l root n log n.

01:19:02.610 --> 01:19:05.030
What that means is in this
subtree, the amount of reading

01:19:05.030 --> 01:19:06.920
we did in the right
subtree, plus the amount

01:19:06.920 --> 01:19:08.780
of writing we did
in the left subtree,

01:19:08.780 --> 01:19:11.120
is at least l root n log n.

01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:13.430
That's our goal over here.

01:19:13.430 --> 01:19:15.300
We want to prove--

01:19:15.300 --> 01:19:18.650
sorry, it's a previous
claim, that's by now erased.

01:19:18.650 --> 01:19:20.060
Is the easier
claim, we just want

01:19:20.060 --> 01:19:23.900
to show that the total amount
of time spent in v's subtree

01:19:23.900 --> 01:19:25.550
is at least log n per operation.

01:19:25.550 --> 01:19:27.410
We're doing l root
n things here.

01:19:27.410 --> 01:19:29.880
So this is a ton of
reading and writing.

01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:32.120
So in that case, we're
happy, because we get

01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:33.980
an actual lower bound on time.

01:19:33.980 --> 01:19:37.520
Otherwise, we don't-- I
mean, these are actual reads

01:19:37.520 --> 01:19:40.920
and writes, or total
number of reads and writes.

01:19:40.920 --> 01:19:43.620
Here we're getting--
in the other case,

01:19:43.620 --> 01:19:51.860
we get r intersect w log
n is at least l root n log

01:19:51.860 --> 01:19:53.960
n, just like before.

01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:57.600
So again, the log ns cancel.

01:19:57.600 --> 01:19:59.750
So here we lose
the log n factor,

01:19:59.750 --> 01:20:02.600
but it's OK,
because this is only

01:20:02.600 --> 01:20:04.350
talking about r intersect w.

01:20:04.350 --> 01:20:06.536
This we use the LCA
charging, to say, well,

01:20:06.536 --> 01:20:07.910
if you look at a
particular read,

01:20:07.910 --> 01:20:09.830
it's only gets
charged by the LCA.

01:20:09.830 --> 01:20:12.140
So then we can afford
to sum up large amounts.

01:20:12.140 --> 01:20:13.370
So it's a little bit weird.

01:20:13.370 --> 01:20:15.579
In this situation, we add
up all the lower bounds.

01:20:15.579 --> 01:20:17.120
Each of them doesn't
give us a log n,

01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:19.620
but in aggregate, we get a log
n, because every leaf appears

01:20:19.620 --> 01:20:21.200
in log n levels.

01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:23.820
In this case, we don't need to
aggregate, because we just say,

01:20:23.820 --> 01:20:25.910
well, the number of
operations in the subtree

01:20:25.910 --> 01:20:28.880
is at least log n per operation.

01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:31.040
This time spent,
cell probe's done,

01:20:31.040 --> 01:20:32.789
is at least log n per operation.

01:20:32.789 --> 01:20:35.330
So in that case, we don't need
to sum the lower bounds, which

01:20:35.330 --> 01:20:36.380
is done.

01:20:36.380 --> 01:20:38.690
So in either case, we're happy.

01:20:38.690 --> 01:20:40.940
Little weird, because you
could have a mix of cases,

01:20:40.940 --> 01:20:44.300
one vertex v could
be in case two,

01:20:44.300 --> 01:20:46.940
then you just ignore
all the things below it.

01:20:46.940 --> 01:20:49.197
The rest of the tree
might be in case one,

01:20:49.197 --> 01:20:50.780
but you can mix and
match one and two,

01:20:50.780 --> 01:20:55.400
as long as you don't use a
one below a two, you're OK,

01:20:55.400 --> 01:20:56.840
you won't double count.

01:20:56.840 --> 01:20:58.910
And so in either
case, we're happy,

01:20:58.910 --> 01:21:02.870
we get a log n lower bound,
either on time per operation,

01:21:02.870 --> 01:21:06.860
or on this kind of
time per operation.

01:21:06.860 --> 01:21:09.850
Add up all those lower bounds,
you get log n per operation,

01:21:09.850 --> 01:21:12.950
or get root n log n per
block operation, which

01:21:12.950 --> 01:21:18.850
implies log n per insert delete
edge, or connectivity query.

01:21:18.850 --> 01:21:23.750
And that proves right
there, more or less on time.

01:21:23.750 --> 01:21:25.970
You can use the same
technique to do a trade off

01:21:25.970 --> 01:21:27.730
between updates and queries.

01:21:27.730 --> 01:21:30.540
This is just log n,
worst case of the two.

01:21:30.540 --> 01:21:32.750
I mentioned what the
bound was last time.

01:21:32.750 --> 01:21:34.640
Same trick works, you
just do more updates

01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:36.469
than queries, or more
queries than updates.

01:21:36.469 --> 01:21:38.260
So we get link/cut
trees are optimal, other

01:21:38.260 --> 01:21:39.627
[? tour ?] trees are optimal.

01:21:39.627 --> 01:21:41.585
And we've got lots of
other points on the trade

01:21:41.585 --> 01:21:43.730
off curve, as you may
recall last class.

01:21:43.730 --> 01:21:47.900
Like our log squared update is
optimal for a log over log log

01:21:47.900 --> 01:21:50.120
query.

01:21:50.120 --> 01:21:53.950
And that's the end of
dynamic graphs, the end

01:21:53.950 --> 01:21:56.517
of advanced data structures.

01:21:56.517 --> 01:21:58.100
Hope you had a fun
time, we got to see

01:21:58.100 --> 01:21:59.520
lots of different topics.

01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:01.830
And I hope you'll enjoy
watching on the videos,

01:22:01.830 --> 01:22:04.580
and let me know if you have
any comments, send an email

01:22:04.580 --> 01:22:06.890
or whatever.

01:22:06.890 --> 01:22:08.090
Yay.

01:22:08.090 --> 01:22:09.940
