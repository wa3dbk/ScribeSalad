00:00:20.475 --> 00:00:21.850
PROFESSOR: So I'll
briefly review

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:24.560
what we were doing last time.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.747
We are gradually
developing the structure

00:00:28.747 --> 00:00:30.080
that we need for thermodynamics.

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:40.730
And the first thing that we
did was to state that it wholly

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:46.070
depends on the existence
of equilibrim--

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.460
is the first and foremost
thing that we need to know,

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.590
is that the objects that we
are studying in thermodynamics

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.180
are in equilibrium.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.370
And once they're
in equilibrium, we

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.310
can characterize them
by a set of properties.

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.330
So there's a list of
coordinates that I

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.160
would have the list here.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.460
And we saw that
since we will also

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.690
need to think in terms of
mechanical work, a good place

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.420
to start-- and since we are
familiar with mechanical

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.480
coordinates-- is to enumerate
here the mechanical coordinates

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.730
that we would describe
the system with.

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:29.080
And we said that we could,
in principal, characterize

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.910
or divide those
coordinates in the form

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:37.750
of some generalized
displacements

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.910
and the corresponding
conjugate forces.

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.960
And typically, the displacements
are extensive proportional

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.320
to the size of your system.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.280
The forces are intensive.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.330
And the work is related to
the product of those two

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.600
in some fashion.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.340
One of the things that
I will do throughout

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.010
is to emphasize that one of
the main materials that we

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.960
are going to look at, and
illustrate the concept with,

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:08.585
is the gas.

00:02:08.585 --> 00:02:12.220
And in particular,
the version of the gas

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.330
that is the ideal gas.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.120
But forgetting the ideal
part for the time being,

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.060
the coordinates that we use
to describe the gas with

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.330
is V and pressure.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.360
And actually, we
saw that in order

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.830
to ultimately be consistent
with how we will define work,

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.670
it is good to think
of minus pressure

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.110
as the appropriate force.

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.960
And so basically, then if I want
to characterize the equilibrium

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.940
state of a gas, I
need, for example,

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.670
to specify where I
lie in this P-V plane.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.230
OK so that's the
first thing to know.

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.280
But then we also realize
that mechanical coordinates

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.880
are insufficient to describe
the properties of the systems

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.480
that we encounter.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.110
For example, if we are
thinking in terms of a spring

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.980
and we pull on
the spring-- so we

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.220
are looking at the relationship
between displacement

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.060
and the force-- the result
that we get how easy it

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.830
is to pull on this depends
on something else--

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:23.640
depends on temperature.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.460
So somehow, we need to
include these properties that

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:31.690
have to do with heat
and heat transfer

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.400
in order to have a complete
description of systems

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.160
that are in equilibrium.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.460
And so going along
that direction,

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:42.370
we started with the Zeroth Law.

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.050
And the statement
of the Zeroth Law

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.440
was the transitivity
of equilibrium--

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.170
if two objects
are in equilibrium

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.310
with each other they are--
two objects are in equilibrium

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.690
with a third object,
they're also in equilibrium

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.250
with each other.

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.270
And we saw that
what that means, is

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:03.170
that once I am at some point
in this coordinate space,

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.210
I know that there
exists some function.

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:07.930
I don't know its
functional form.

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.730
This empirical temperature
and being in equilibrium

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.260
means that there is
this important function

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.810
of the coordinates
of the first system

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.510
equal to some other functional
or form potentially,

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.130
depending on the coordinates
of the second system.

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:33.650
And this empirical temperature
has to be the same.

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.490
We said that this is kind
of like being on a scale,

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.740
and having a balance
between different things,

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.230
and then they are in
balance with each other.

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:46.800
So we know that there's
something like mass.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.860
Now, when we describe this
in the context of the gas,

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.890
we noted that for all gases in
the limit that they are dilute,

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:01.960
the isotherms-- the places that
would correspond in this case

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.240
to always being in
contact with the object

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.620
is at a fixed temperature,
form these hyperboles.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:15.020
So the isotherms in
the limit of dilute

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.925
are of the form PV is
proportional to time span.

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.170
We can call that theta.

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:28.110
We can use that, even, to
define the ideal gas temperature

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.450
scale, provided that we
choose some proportionality

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:34.880
coefficient which
was selected so

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.910
that the temperature
of water, ice,

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:42.330
steam, coexistent at
a particular value.

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:46.370
OK, so that's the specific
property of the ideal gas

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:50.250
as far as its
temperature is concerned.

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:56.830
The next thing that
we did was to look

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:02.250
at how changes are carrying a
system, a particular system.

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:07.710
And we found that if you take
the system from one location

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:12.190
in its coordinate space
to another location,

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:17.730
do it in a manner that does not
involve the exchange of heat.

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:20.170
So basically, you
idealize this thing

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:24.390
and isolate it from
any other source--

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:26.370
that the amount of
work-- and we can then

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:29.180
calculate mechanical work--
the amount of mechanical work

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.640
that you do is only a function
of the initial and final

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.890
states, and does
not depend on how

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:42.020
you supply the work that
produces this, et cetera.

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:47.390
And so that immediately reminded
us of conservation of energy,

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:54.710
and a suggestion that there
exists this function that

00:06:54.710 --> 00:07:00.720
depends on where you are in this
coordinate representation that

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:04.900
gives the total energy
content of the system.

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:08.630
What was important
was that, of course,

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:15.950
we want to relax the condition
of making changes over which

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:19.880
there is no heat
exchange to the system.

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:25.000
And more generally then,
we said that the changes

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.080
that we obtain in energy are
the sum of the two components--

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:33.500
the amount of work
that you do on it,

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:38.780
and that we know how to measure
from our various mechanical

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:40.490
prescriptions.

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:44.120
But if there is a shortcoming
from the internal energy

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:47.940
function that we had
constructed previously,

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:51.320
and the work that we compute
for a particular process,

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:54.530
we say that in
that process, there

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:57.930
was some heat that
went into the system.

00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:00.640
And it is, again,
important to state

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:06.030
that this dE really only depends
on the initial and final state.

00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:09.110
So this depends on state.

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:12.620
While these things-- that's
why we put a bar on them--

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:15.290
depend on the particular
path that we take.

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:24.400
Now again, if you
ask, well, what can

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:28.040
we say in this context
for the ideal gas?

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:38.640
And there is the very
nice experiment by Joule

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:45.570
where he said, let's
isolate our gas, let's say,

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:48.830
into two chambers.

00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:53.870
These are kind of rigid
balls, very nicely isolated

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:55.830
from the environment.

00:08:55.830 --> 00:09:03.150
Initially, the gas is confined
completely onto one side.

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:06.792
So let's say that the
initial state is over here,

00:09:06.792 --> 00:09:09.530
with this volume.

00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:12.670
And then we release this.

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:16.010
And so the gas goes and expands.

00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:17.625
And we wait sufficiently.

00:09:17.625 --> 00:09:19.150
We wait sufficiently.

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:21.650
Ultimately, we're
settled to a place,

00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:25.911
let's say over here--
the final state.

00:09:25.911 --> 00:09:29.090
Now, it's important
to say that I

00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:33.520
don't know the intermediate
state of this transformation.

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:36.070
So I can't say that
somewhere between t

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:38.380
equals to zero when
I open the valve,

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:41.830
and t goes to infinity where
the whole thing is settled.

00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:44.255
Zero and infinity points I know.

00:09:44.255 --> 00:09:48.495
In between, I can't
really have an idea

00:09:48.495 --> 00:09:50.810
of where to put my system.

00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:54.780
It is at non-equilibrium
by construction.

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:57.830
But this is a process
that by definition I

00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:00.640
follow the path
along which there

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:05.790
was no input either in
the form of work or heat

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:06.510
into the system.

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:08.300
It was isolated.

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:11.470
So all I know for sure is
that however amount of energy

00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:15.200
I had initially is
what I have finally.

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:18.790
The observation of
Joule was that if we

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:22.160
do this for the case
of a dilute gas,

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:25.760
I start with some
initial temperature Ti.

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:28.080
I go to some final temperature.

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:30.600
But that final
temperature is the same

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:32.600
as the initial temperature.

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:35.660
And that is actually
why I put both

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:39.390
of these points on
the same isotherm

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:41.240
that I had drawn before.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.897
So although I don't know
anything about the in

00:10:43.897 --> 00:10:48.890
between points, I know that this
is the property of the system.

00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:52.660
And essentially,
we know, therefore,

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:56.090
that although in
principle I can write E

00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:58.960
as a function of
P and V, it must

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:02.650
be only a function
of the product PV,

00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:05.790
because it only-- P
changes in the process.

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:07.270
V changes in the process.

00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:09.960
But PV remains constant.

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:12.600
Or if you like, E
is really a function

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:16.180
of T, which is related
to the product.

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:21.900
And sorry about being kind
of inconsistent with using T

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:23.410
and theta for temperature.

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:28.430
OK, any questions?

00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:33.160
So this is kind of recap
of what we were doing.

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:36.820
All right, now, it
would be good if we

00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:39.370
can construct this
function somehow--

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:41.330
at least theoretically, even.

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:45.410
And you would say, well,
if I had this spring,

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:48.090
and I didn't know whether it
was a Hookean or a nonlinear

00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:52.500
spring, what I could do
is I could pull on it,

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:55.770
calculate what the force
is, and the displacement,

00:11:55.770 --> 00:12:01.450
and integrate f dx and
use the formula that quite

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:07.670
generally, the mechanical
work is sum over i,

00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:09.000
let's say Ji dxi.

00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:13.690
Now, of course you
know that I can only

00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:16.210
do this if I pull
it on this spring

00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:20.150
sufficiently slowly, so
that the work that I do

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:24.010
goes into changing the
internal energy of the spring.

00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:27.150
And then that would be
a contribution to dE.

00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:29.990
If I do that rapidly, then
it will send this spring

00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:31.040
into oscillation.

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:36.730
I have no idea, again,
where the system

00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:40.020
is in the intermediate stages.

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:43.780
So I can use this
kind of formula

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:47.760
if, in this type of
diagram that indicates

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:52.220
the state of the system, I
proceed sufficiently slowly

00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:54.780
so that I can put points
that corresponding

00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:57.120
to all intermediate states.

00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:04.340
And so that's for things that
are sufficiently slow and close

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:08.500
to equilibrium that
we call quasistatic.

00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:16.430
And so in principal, I guess
rather than opening this

00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:21.600
immediately, I could
have put a slow piston

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:25.110
here, change its position
slowly, so that at each stage

00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:28.120
I can calculate where
I am on the PV diagram.

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:32.660
And I could have calculated
what the work is, and used

00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:37.290
this formula to calculate
the contribution of the work

00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:40.800
to the change in
internal energy.

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:46.930
OK, now I said that
it would be ideal--

00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:50.070
and what we would like
to do, ultimately--

00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:56.524
is to have a similar
formula for dQ.

00:13:56.524 --> 00:14:05.030
And if we look by analogy,
we see that for W,

00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:07.440
you have J's times the X's.

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:09.940
The forces are the
things that tell us

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:13.170
whether systems are in
equilibrium with each other.

00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:16.590
So two-- if I have,
let's say, a piston

00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:18.960
separating two parts
of the gas, the piston

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:20.950
will not move one
direction or the other

00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:22.540
if the pressure
from one direction

00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:25.550
is the same as the pressure
from the other direction.

00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:29.470
So mechanical equilibrium
tells us that J's are the same.

00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:33.000
And it suggests that
if I want to write

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.850
a similar type of formula for
heat, that the thing that I

00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:41.980
should put here is temperature
or empirical temperature, which

00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:45.490
is, again, a measure
of thermal equilibrium.

00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:48.700
And then the question
that would immediately

00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:52.180
jump onto you is, what
is the conjugate that I

00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:54.880
have put for the displacement?

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:57.130
And you know
ultimately that it is

00:14:57.130 --> 00:14:59.360
going to end up to be entropy.

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:03.940
And so the next part of
the story is to build that.

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:08.349
And we're going to do that
through the Second Law

00:15:08.349 --> 00:15:09.098
of Thermodynamics.

00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:18.130
Any questions?

00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:19.119
Yes.

00:15:19.119 --> 00:15:21.410
AUDIENCE: I mean, this is
kind of a semantics question,

00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:24.130
but what always confuses
me in thermodynamics

00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:27.780
when we talk about quasistatic
is, I mean, if it isn't

00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:32.450
quasistatic, introductory
formation of [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:34.770
doesn't really give a
means to address it.

00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:38.250
So we have to rely on the
fact that it's quasistatic.

00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:40.370
And the only way
we could check it

00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:42.530
is to assume that what
we're already saying is true

00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:43.970
will be true.

00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:47.960
So I guess my question is,
in the context of a spring,

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:50.130
like, there's
obviously-- there exists

00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:54.374
a physical threshold at which--
that's not infinitely slow,

00:15:54.374 --> 00:15:56.290
and which you can get a
reasonable measurement

00:15:56.290 --> 00:15:58.540
if you're doing an experiment.

00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:01.180
PROFESSOR: So in
all of these things,

00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:06.360
I would sort of resort to some
kind of a limiting procedure.

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:10.290
So you could, for example, pull
the spring at some velocity,

00:16:10.290 --> 00:16:12.910
and figure out what
the amount of work is,

00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:15.400
and gradually reduce
that velocity,

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:18.990
and hope that the formula--
the values-- that you get

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:22.610
are converging to something
as you go to low velocity.

00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:25.060
I don't think there's
actually a threshold velocity,

00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:28.140
kind of implied that if you
are slower than something, then

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:29.290
it would work.

00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:32.910
I think it really only works
in the limit of zero velocity.

00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:38.110
And so if you like,
that's kind of procedure

00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:40.480
you would use to define
derivatives, right?

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:44.800
So you can't say what's the
meaning of velocity in physics.

00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:51.580
So, but it is an idealization.

00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:54.180
I said at the beginning
that the very-- actually, I

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:55.930
would say that
more fundamentally,

00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:58.440
the thing that is
really an idealization

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:00.690
is this adiabatic walls.

00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:03.080
Even the concept
of equilibrium--

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:05.960
what do we see around us
that we are absolutely

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:07.780
100% sure in equilibrium?

00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:08.970
Nothing is.

00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:12.339
The fate of the universe is that
all of our atoms and molecules

00:17:12.339 --> 00:17:15.599
are going to separate out
and go to infinity, if it

00:17:15.599 --> 00:17:16.495
expands forever.

00:17:16.495 --> 00:17:16.994
Right?

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:28.610
OK, Second Law--
all right, so again,

00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:31.620
we want to sort of
set our minds back

00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:33.720
to where these laws
were developed,

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:35.720
which is in the 18th century.

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:42.510
And the thing that was of
importance at that time

00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:46.440
was sort of Industrial
Revolution-- get things moving.

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:50.390
You need energy, and you
would get energy from coal,

00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:54.730
and so you need to
convert heat to work.

00:17:54.730 --> 00:18:00.160
And this conversion of heat
to work is important to you.

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:07.440
So typical thing that you
have for your coal engine

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:11.380
is you have something
that is a source of heat.

00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:16.090
So there's, for example, a
fire that you're burning.

00:18:16.090 --> 00:18:23.490
You have some kind
of a machine that

00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:27.280
has components, such as a
piston, that is being heated.

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:30.610
And during this process,
you extract a certain amount

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:34.950
of heat from your fire.

00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:37.100
And then typically,
you realize that you

00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:44.590
will be releasing a
certain amount of energy

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:47.920
back to the atmosphere,
causing pollution.

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:52.110
So there is a coal sink.

00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:54.500
But in the process,
you will be extracting

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:57.970
a certain amount of work.

00:18:57.970 --> 00:19:02.770
And what you want
to do is to make

00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:04.840
the best use of this set up.

00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:10.930
So you're concerned
with efficiency,

00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:15.160
which is defined to
be the amount of work

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:20.190
that you're going to extract
out of a certain amount of heat

00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:27.180
that you expend in
your coal, or whatever.

00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:31.800
And again, based on
conservation of energy,

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:40.380
we expect that this W to be
less than QH by an amount

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:43.390
that you are setting
to the exhaust.

00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:47.980
And because of that, this
eta has to be less than

00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:50.415
or equal to 1, in principal.

00:19:55.440 --> 00:20:05.050
Now, another device that is
using the same rough principles

00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:07.475
is the same thing
going in reverse,

00:20:07.475 --> 00:20:08.475
which is a refrigerator.

00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:21.740
So in order to
cool this room, you

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:26.120
use electricity or
some other means

00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:34.120
of doing work on a machine whose
job it is to extract heat out

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:35.010
of the room.

00:20:37.690 --> 00:20:40.362
So let's say this is our room.

00:20:40.362 --> 00:20:44.550
We want to extract the heat.

00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:47.400
But of course, that heat
has to go somewhere.

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:51.860
So this has to have
some kind of exhaust

00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:58.020
putting this again to the
atmosphere or somewhere.

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:04.380
So how good is this
thing performing?

00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:10.040
So there is a measure of the
performance-- figure of merit,

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:13.590
if you like, for
this-- which we will

00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:20.560
label by omega, which is
how much heat you were

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:26.520
able to remove from the room
given some amount of work

00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:28.590
or energy that was put in.

00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:37.180
And again, because of
conservation, this W

00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:39.140
is going to be QH minus QC.

00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:47.240
Now, this particular
number, which

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:50.850
is a useful measure of how
well your refrigerator works,

00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:53.160
has no particular constraint.

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:54.390
It can be less than 1.

00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:56.290
It can be larger than 1.

00:21:56.290 --> 00:22:00.350
So again, you want it to
be as large as possible,

00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:03.960
and in principle, it
can be 200-- whatever.

00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:15.760
So clearly, already
these are very much

00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:18.410
idealizations of some
complicated process

00:22:18.410 --> 00:22:20.520
that is going on.

00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:22.900
And the thing that
is interesting

00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:27.740
is that you can take
a look at how well you

00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:31.500
are able to do these
processes, and then

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:34.820
make this equation
that we wrote up here

00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:37.880
to be an exact
differential form.

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:42.160
So how you do that is an
interesting thing that I think

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:45.310
is worth repeating
and exploring.

00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:50.750
And essentially, you do
that by formulating things

00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:52.760
that are possible
or not possible

00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:55.060
through the Second
Law, and then doing

00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:57.760
some mathematical manipulations.

00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:02.480
And we will use two
formulations of the Second Law

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:05.070
due to Kevin and Clausius.

00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:11.710
So I will indicate them
either by K for Kelvin--

00:23:11.710 --> 00:23:15.260
so Kelvin's statement
of the Second Law

00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:32.230
is the following-- no process
is possible whose sole result

00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:42.770
is complete conversion
of heat to work.

00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:55.810
So what that is, is a statement
about how good an engine

00:23:55.810 --> 00:23:57.150
you can make.

00:23:57.150 --> 00:24:01.030
He says that you cannot make
an engine that takes a certain

00:24:01.030 --> 00:24:04.910
amount of heat and completely
makes it to work without having

00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:07.770
any waste QC.

00:24:07.770 --> 00:24:18.070
So basically, it says that
there is no ideal engine,

00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:21.549
and that your eta has
to be less than 1.

00:24:27.910 --> 00:24:31.020
There is a second
variant of this,

00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:37.640
which is due to Clausius-- says
that no process is possible

00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:53.520
whose sole result is transfer
of heat from cold to hot.

00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:07.800
So if you want to make
an ideal refrigerator,

00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:10.680
what you want to do is
to extract more and more

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:16.520
QC for less and less
W. So the ideal version

00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:20.240
would be where essentially,
the limit of zero

00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:23.940
work, you would still
be able to transfer heat

00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:28.335
from the room to the outside
and get an ideal refrigerator.

00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:36.126
And Clausius says that
it's not possible.

00:25:36.126 --> 00:25:44.860
So these are two statements
of the Second Law.

00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:49.670
There are other versions and
statements of the Second Law,

00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:56.870
but these are kind of most close
to this historical perspective.

00:25:56.870 --> 00:26:00.710
And then the question is,
well, which one of them

00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:02.010
do you want to use?

00:26:02.010 --> 00:26:06.060
And since I will be
kind of switching

00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:08.660
between using one
or the other, it

00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:11.270
would be good if I can
show that they really

00:26:11.270 --> 00:26:13.660
are the same statement,
and I'm really

00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:16.920
not making use of two
different statements when

00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:20.400
I use one or the
other alternative.

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:27.610
So what I really want to do is
to show that these are really,

00:26:27.610 --> 00:26:30.180
logically, the same statement.

00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:33.670
And essentially,
what that means is

00:26:33.670 --> 00:26:39.010
that the two statements
are equivalent.

00:26:39.010 --> 00:26:43.584
And two statements are
equivalent to each other

00:26:43.584 --> 00:26:49.950
if one of them being
incorrect-- which I've indicated

00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:56.540
by K with a bar on it-- implies
that the other one is correct,

00:26:56.540 --> 00:27:01.930
and simultaneously,
the other way around.

00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:10.360
And since this does not take
more than a few minutes,

00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:15.790
and is a nice exercise, I
think it's worth showing this.

00:27:15.790 --> 00:27:20.790
So let's say that
somebody came to you

00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:24.770
and said that I have
constructed a machine that

00:27:24.770 --> 00:27:27.040
violates Clausius.

00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:30.430
We'll call that K bar.

00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:32.490
So what does that machine do?

00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:43.060
What that machine does
is it converts heat, Q,

00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:49.870
completely to work, without
needing to exhaust anything.

00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:54.155
So this W is this Q, and
there's no exhaust machine.

00:27:54.155 --> 00:27:56.890
He says, OK I have this machine.

00:27:56.890 --> 00:28:03.160
I say, OK, what I will do
is I will use that work

00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:05.490
to run a refrigerator.

00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:08.320
So I connect that
to a refrigerator.

00:28:13.270 --> 00:28:27.040
And that work will be used to
take heat, QC, out of some room

00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:31.490
and exhaust it to
the atmosphere.

00:28:31.490 --> 00:28:36.220
And I will choose
the exhaust location

00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:38.900
to be the same as
the source of heat

00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:45.596
that I had for my
anti-Kelvin machine.

00:28:45.596 --> 00:28:46.095
OK?

00:28:49.810 --> 00:28:55.386
So then if you look at how
the sum of these two machines

00:28:55.386 --> 00:29:03.590
is operating together, from
the perspective of looking

00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:05.930
at the sum of the two
machines, the work

00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:08.030
is just an internal operation.

00:29:08.030 --> 00:29:09.640
You don't really care.

00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:15.230
So as far as the net thing is
concerned, what you're seeing

00:29:15.230 --> 00:29:20.330
is that there is no work
involved externally.

00:29:20.330 --> 00:29:21.770
It's all internal.

00:29:21.770 --> 00:29:23.590
But what is happening
is that you're

00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:31.390
pulling QC out of the room,
and exhausting, presumably,

00:29:31.390 --> 00:29:38.310
what you have here-- QH
minus Q to the other side.

00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:42.295
This, again, by conservation of
energy must be the same as QC,

00:29:42.295 --> 00:29:44.090
right?

00:29:44.090 --> 00:29:48.990
So if you have a machine
that violates Kelvin,

00:29:48.990 --> 00:29:53.090
you connect it to a
refrigerator, and what you have

00:29:53.090 --> 00:29:56.520
is a machine that transfers
heat from a cold-air

00:29:56.520 --> 00:30:01.870
to a hot-air body,
and violates Clausius.

00:30:01.870 --> 00:30:07.440
So that's the first part
we have established.

00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:09.610
And to establish
the second part,

00:30:09.610 --> 00:30:19.230
let's say that we have a
machine that violates Clausius.

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:29.880
And this machine takes a
certain amount of heat, Q,

00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:36.670
from the room, and deposits
it to the hotter outside.

00:30:36.670 --> 00:30:40.990
What we will do
immediately is to take

00:30:40.990 --> 00:30:48.040
some of this heat that has
been generated by this machine

00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:57.240
and use it in a regular engine
to create some amount of work.

00:30:57.240 --> 00:31:02.200
And then this has to take
an amount of heat QH,

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:08.060
deposit an amount of heat, QC,
which we will select to be,

00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:12.760
essentially, the temperature
or the room from which

00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:16.880
the anti Clausius
machine is operating.

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:20.020
And then we will run this
engine several times,

00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:24.010
or fractions of times, et
cetera, and the other machine

00:31:24.010 --> 00:31:32.160
several times, ensuring that
QC is the same as Q. That

00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:38.230
is, the engine puts
out as much dumped heat

00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:43.330
as this anti-Clausius machine
is extracting from the room.

00:31:43.330 --> 00:31:50.550
Then if you look at the
combined system, what

00:31:50.550 --> 00:31:58.280
we see is that the combined
system is doing the following--

00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:00.540
this was equivalent to this.

00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:08.110
This is equivalent
to a combined system

00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:10.640
that does a certain
amount of work.

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:14.010
So there is a W
that is coming out.

00:32:14.010 --> 00:32:17.620
There is no heat
exchange with the room,

00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:20.690
because we ensured that these
two heats are completely

00:32:20.690 --> 00:32:21.940
balanced.

00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:24.080
So you can sort of think
of them as something

00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:27.210
that is internal to
this bigger machine.

00:32:27.210 --> 00:32:29.920
And so what is happening
is that there's

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:35.550
a certain amount of heat, QH
minus Q that is taken here

00:32:35.550 --> 00:32:39.890
that has to be equal to W,
by conservation of energy.

00:32:39.890 --> 00:32:42.400
And we have converted
heat entirely

00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:47.100
to work, violating
Kelvin's statement.

00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:49.984
So basically, we
have proved this.

00:33:27.552 --> 00:33:28.135
Any questions?

00:33:32.190 --> 00:33:34.920
OK, one more step-- there
is actually a couple

00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:39.805
more steps left before we get to
construct our entropy function.

00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:45.090
And the next step is
the Carnot Engine.

00:33:53.950 --> 00:33:58.570
So this is yet another
one of these idealizations

00:33:58.570 --> 00:34:02.220
that-- again, theoretical
construct, which you

00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:05.570
can try to approach as in
some limiting procedure.

00:34:08.219 --> 00:34:18.139
A Carnot engine is any engine
with the following properties--

00:34:18.139 --> 00:34:43.380
that is, one, reversible,
two, operates in a cycle,

00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:56.219
and three, all inputs--
all heat inputs--

00:34:56.219 --> 00:35:00.990
outputs at two temperatures.

00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:16.680
OK, so let's go
through the conditions.

00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:24.780
Reversible implies
that at any stage,

00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:30.810
if I change the directions
of inputs and outputs,

00:35:30.810 --> 00:35:33.230
it will just go backward.

00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:50.573
So can go forward, backward,
by reversing inputs, outputs.

00:35:56.850 --> 00:36:04.700
And so again, think of
the case of our spring

00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:09.430
that we were pushing
back and forth.

00:36:09.430 --> 00:36:15.690
In order for it to have this
property of reversibility,

00:36:15.690 --> 00:36:22.300
I should not only do it pulling
down and up sufficiently slowly

00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:26.230
so that at each stage, I
can define its tension,

00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:28.910
but also as far
as its connection

00:36:28.910 --> 00:36:32.430
to the outside world, I have
to do it frictionlessly,

00:36:32.430 --> 00:36:36.290
so that if I were to reverse
the direction of the force

00:36:36.290 --> 00:36:40.290
that I have, it will either go
forward or backward, reversing

00:36:40.290 --> 00:36:41.990
the path that it has.

00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:45.270
If there is any friction
that is involved,

00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:48.270
then I cannot do that.

00:36:48.270 --> 00:36:51.530
So essentially,
this reversibility

00:36:51.530 --> 00:36:58.760
is some kind of a generalization
of the frictionless condition

00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:00.105
that we would use in mechanics.

00:37:05.870 --> 00:37:07.330
The cycle part is easy.

00:37:10.910 --> 00:37:14.460
Essentially, it says
that the start and end

00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:15.400
points are the same.

00:37:24.430 --> 00:37:30.920
And it kind of harks
back to this statement

00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:35.240
that is part of either
one of these formulations

00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:38.630
of the Second Law--
that is the net result

00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:41.010
or sole result is something.

00:37:41.010 --> 00:37:43.710
So we want the
engine to essentially

00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:47.020
be back to where it
was, so that when

00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:49.820
we are looking at changes
that are involved,

00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:52.450
we say, OK, the engine is
not part of the equation.

00:37:52.450 --> 00:37:55.560
It is where it was
at the beginning

00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:59.490
and at the end of the cycle.

00:37:59.490 --> 00:38:05.110
Now there's something
that I didn't emphasize,

00:38:05.110 --> 00:38:09.900
but I was-- and actually,
I was not really using,

00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:13.170
but you may have
thought I was using--

00:38:13.170 --> 00:38:18.070
is that in all of these
pictures that I drew,

00:38:18.070 --> 00:38:21.990
I said there is a hot place
and there's a cold place.

00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:26.000
Now, I didn't specify
exactly what these are,

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:29.820
and whether this corresponds
to a particular temperature.

00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:33.700
Now, for the case of the Carnot
engine, I have to be precise.

00:38:33.700 --> 00:38:37.820
I have to say that this is
always at one temperature.

00:38:37.820 --> 00:38:40.480
This is always at the
other temperature.

00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:46.450
So these Carnot engines
are defined implicitly

00:38:46.450 --> 00:38:49.280
with two temperature
labels corresponding

00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:53.640
to the hot part
and the cold part.

00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:56.320
In principle, everything
else that I talked about

00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:59.066
could have had a
range of temperatures.

00:38:59.066 --> 00:39:01.710
But the Carnot engine says,
OK, just two temperatures.

00:39:07.370 --> 00:39:11.820
OK, so for the Carnot
engine, if I can now

00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:18.910
draw a diagram that would
be kind of straight line

00:39:18.910 --> 00:39:21.170
version of what I had before.

00:39:21.170 --> 00:39:27.700
And the Carnot engine will be
extracting a certain amount

00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:33.100
of heat, QH, from
here, QC from here,

00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:36.150
doing a certain amount of work.

00:39:36.150 --> 00:39:40.910
And since it is reversible, I
could actually run it backward.

00:39:40.910 --> 00:39:47.890
I could have W. I
could have QH, QC,

00:39:47.890 --> 00:39:50.290
and it would work
as a refrigerator.

00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:10.780
Now, it is good to have
at least one example--

00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:15.590
that such a theoretical
construct as a Carnot engine

00:40:15.590 --> 00:40:20.120
can be made based on
things that we have so far.

00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:24.060
And we can be
explicit, and show that

00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:26.386
for the case of the ideal gas.

00:40:37.010 --> 00:40:44.950
So we said that a gas I
can represent in equivalent

00:40:44.950 --> 00:40:48.230
by a point in the
pressure-volume diagram.

00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:56.580
So let's say that
what is the working

00:40:56.580 --> 00:40:59.870
substance of this
Carnot engine is a gas.

00:40:59.870 --> 00:41:04.420
And part of this
whole story is that it

00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:09.010
should be working between two
isotherms-- the TH and TC.

00:41:09.010 --> 00:41:11.490
But we've already
established that we

00:41:11.490 --> 00:41:16.460
can have isotherms for the
ideal gas that correspond

00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:22.300
to these curves that
correspond to PV as constant.

00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:25.490
So I could really choose
one of the isotherms

00:41:25.490 --> 00:41:28.110
that we discussed before
corresponds to TH.

00:41:28.110 --> 00:41:30.530
One corresponds to TC.

00:41:30.530 --> 00:41:40.740
And I can imagine taking a gas
whose initial state is point A,

00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:47.810
and expanding it while
maintaining it at this isotherm

00:41:47.810 --> 00:41:54.360
TH, and ending up
at some point B.

00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:58.920
So as I'm expanding this,
let's say we have put this gas.

00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:02.510
I have this piston
that contains this gas.

00:42:02.510 --> 00:42:06.500
My TH and TC
correspond to two baths

00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:09.630
that correspond to, if you
like, lakes-- a temperature

00:42:09.630 --> 00:42:11.480
TH, lakes at temperature TC.

00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:14.890
I took my piston, put
it into the hot bath,

00:42:14.890 --> 00:42:18.550
make it expand up to some point.

00:42:18.550 --> 00:42:21.160
And in the process,
there is certainly

00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:25.610
a certain amount of heat that
will go into the system, QH.

00:42:28.530 --> 00:42:36.260
So I have taken QH
out of the hot source.

00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:39.290
Now, next thing
that I want to do

00:42:39.290 --> 00:42:44.092
is to take this, and put
it into the colder lake.

00:42:44.092 --> 00:42:49.340
But what the process is,
is I have to do it in a way

00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:52.270
that there is no heat exchange.

00:42:52.270 --> 00:42:57.850
So I have to find the path
that goes from the hot bath

00:42:57.850 --> 00:43:02.150
to the cold path-- to
point C, some point C--

00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:03.430
without any heat involved.

00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:08.280
We'll have to ask
how that's possible,

00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:11.040
and what's the
structure of that path.

00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:14.480
Once I'm in the
colder bath, then I

00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:21.280
can expand my gas
up to some point D.

00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:25.620
And clearly, I have to choose
this point D sufficiently

00:43:25.620 --> 00:43:30.160
precisely so that
then, when I take

00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:35.520
my gas from the cool to
the original hot position,

00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:40.620
I end up at precisely the
location that I started,

00:43:40.620 --> 00:43:42.480
so that I have
completed a cycle.

00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:47.040
So it's necessary
that I should be

00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:52.580
able to construct these
two paths, BC and DA, that

00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:55.340
correspond to no heat exchange.

00:43:55.340 --> 00:43:58.940
And somehow I'm sure that
I can complete this cycle.

00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:13.210
So the paths BC
and DA are called

00:44:13.210 --> 00:44:20.820
adiabats, or adiabatic
paths, in the sense

00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:23.980
that this is what
you would get if you

00:44:23.980 --> 00:44:30.840
put your system in a container
with these adiabatic walls that

00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:33.580
allows no exchange of heat.

00:44:33.580 --> 00:44:37.500
Now clearly, I also want to
do this sufficiently slowly

00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:39.910
so that infinitesimally,
I can draw

00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:42.510
this path as a series of points.

00:44:42.510 --> 00:44:46.180
And so I don't want to do what
was in the Joule expansion

00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:50.160
experiment, and suddenly
expand the whole thing.

00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:52.150
I have to do it
sufficiently slowly

00:44:52.150 --> 00:44:57.890
so that the conditions of this
Carnot engine are satisfied.

00:44:57.890 --> 00:45:00.570
So along these paths,
what do I know?

00:45:00.570 --> 00:45:04.550
By definition dQ is 0.

00:45:04.550 --> 00:45:12.990
And dQ is dE minus
dW along those paths.

00:45:12.990 --> 00:45:16.790
And since I'm performing these
paths sufficiently slowly,

00:45:16.790 --> 00:45:23.440
I can write the W
as PdV minus PdV.

00:45:32.090 --> 00:45:36.170
Now, what you will show
in the problem set is

00:45:36.170 --> 00:45:40.680
that I don't need to make any
assumption about the functional

00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:47.855
form of energy on P and V. Just
knowing that I'm describing

00:45:47.855 --> 00:45:52.310
a system that is characterized
by two coordinates, P and V,

00:45:52.310 --> 00:45:56.320
is sufficient for you to
construct these curves.

00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:58.360
Turns out that if you
have more than two

00:45:58.360 --> 00:46:01.080
coordinates-- three or four
coordinates-- at this time

00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:03.640
you don't know that you
will be able to do so.

00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:06.750
But we're sticking with this.

00:46:06.750 --> 00:46:10.610
For simplicity, I'm going
to choose this-- the form

00:46:10.610 --> 00:46:14.675
that I have for the ideal gas,
which I know that it's really

00:46:14.675 --> 00:46:18.540
a function only
of the product PV.

00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:21.640
This is what we had used before.

00:46:21.640 --> 00:46:25.650
And again, so as to
simplify the algebra,

00:46:25.650 --> 00:46:31.175
I will use the form that is
applicable to a monoatomic gas.

00:46:35.290 --> 00:46:38.050
And this-- I really have
no reason to do this,

00:46:38.050 --> 00:46:40.270
except that I want to be
able to get through this

00:46:40.270 --> 00:46:43.085
in two minutes with the algebra.

00:46:43.085 --> 00:46:47.220
So I will write the
energy to be 3/2 PV.

00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:51.590
So then for that particular
choice, what I have here

00:46:51.590 --> 00:46:57.210
is d of 3/2 PV plus PdV.

00:46:57.210 --> 00:47:09.420
And that's 3/2 PdV plus
V, 3/2 VdP plus PdV,

00:47:09.420 --> 00:47:19.600
which is 5/2 PdV
plus 3/2 VdP is 0.

00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:22.280
And you can
rearrange that easily

00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:35.030
to dP over P plus
5/3 dV over V is 0.

00:47:35.030 --> 00:47:40.470
And this is simply the
derivative of log of PV

00:47:40.470 --> 00:47:43.700
to the power of 5/3.

00:47:43.700 --> 00:47:49.010
And since this
derivative is 0, you

00:47:49.010 --> 00:47:53.920
know that along the curves that
correspond to no heat exchange,

00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:58.600
you have something like
PV to the power of gamma--

00:47:58.600 --> 00:48:08.620
in this case, gamma being
5/3-- that is some constant.

00:48:11.730 --> 00:48:16.695
So after you have done your
expansion, all you need is to,

00:48:16.695 --> 00:48:19.910
in this diagram, go
continuously along the path

00:48:19.910 --> 00:48:24.720
that corresponds to this
formula that we have indicated.

00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:27.330
And this formula
describes a path

00:48:27.330 --> 00:48:30.230
that is distinct
from the isotherm.

00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:32.350
So you start from somewhere.

00:48:32.350 --> 00:48:34.400
You start along some path.

00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:38.750
You are guaranteed to hit the
other isotherm at some point.

00:48:38.750 --> 00:48:40.410
You start from the
starting point.

00:48:40.410 --> 00:48:41.840
You go backward.

00:48:41.840 --> 00:48:44.950
You're guaranteed to hit
the isotherm at some point.

00:48:44.950 --> 00:48:46.490
And then you join
those two points,

00:48:46.490 --> 00:48:48.420
and you've completed your cycle.

00:48:48.420 --> 00:48:54.340
And so you know that, at least
for the case of the ideal gas,

00:48:54.340 --> 00:48:57.100
or actually for any
two-coordinate system,

00:48:57.100 --> 00:49:00.870
you can construct
a cardinal cycle.

00:49:00.870 --> 00:49:06.070
That is, put your material,
go through a cycle that

00:49:06.070 --> 00:49:10.240
is reversible with all heat
exchanges at two temperatures

00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:10.740
only.

00:49:32.490 --> 00:49:37.464
OK, now why is this
idealization even useful?

00:49:37.464 --> 00:49:40.140
Well, we said that
this Carnot engine

00:49:40.140 --> 00:49:48.160
is stamped by really two
temperatures-- TH and TC.

00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:53.180
And the following
theorem is important,

00:49:53.180 --> 00:50:06.410
which says that of all
engines operating only

00:50:06.410 --> 00:50:14.900
between TH and TC, the Carnot
engine is most efficient.

00:50:27.700 --> 00:50:31.440
So we are going to move
away from this idealization

00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:34.955
that we've made, but so
far, only in one small step.

00:50:34.955 --> 00:50:38.390
That is, we are still going
to assume that all heat

00:50:38.390 --> 00:50:43.470
exchanges are done
between TH and TC.

00:50:43.470 --> 00:50:47.270
OK, and so let's
say that we have

00:50:47.270 --> 00:50:56.320
some kind of an engine which
does not have to be reversible.

00:50:56.320 --> 00:51:00.080
So because it does not
have to be reversible,

00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:05.270
it's not a Carnot engine, but
otherwise, operates completely

00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:07.100
between these two points.

00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:14.000
So it takes, let's say,
heat QH prime, QC prime,

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:21.210
and does a certain
amount of work W.

00:51:21.210 --> 00:51:26.250
And so somebody
comes and says, I've

00:51:26.250 --> 00:51:30.860
constructed this engine
that is actually very good.

00:51:30.860 --> 00:51:33.590
It's better than
your Carnot engine.

00:51:33.590 --> 00:51:35.650
I say, no, that's not possible.

00:51:35.650 --> 00:51:37.380
And the way that I
will prove it to you

00:51:37.380 --> 00:51:42.280
is as follows-- I will take
the output of your engine,

00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:46.950
connect it to a Carnot engine,
and since the Carnot engine

00:51:46.950 --> 00:51:53.460
can be run backward, it
will act as a refrigerator

00:51:53.460 --> 00:51:57.390
and extract heat and
deposit heat precisely

00:51:57.390 --> 00:52:02.530
at the two temperatures that
your engine is operating.

00:52:02.530 --> 00:52:08.050
So if somebody looks at the
combination of these two,

00:52:08.050 --> 00:52:10.830
what do they see?

00:52:10.830 --> 00:52:14.100
The thing that they
see for the combination

00:52:14.100 --> 00:52:16.980
is that there is
some entity that

00:52:16.980 --> 00:52:20.870
is operating between TH and TC.

00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:23.400
And there is some
internal amount of work

00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:26.440
that is going on, and you
don't care about that.

00:52:26.440 --> 00:52:31.970
But there is a certain amount
of heat, QH prime minus QH that

00:52:31.970 --> 00:52:35.050
becomes QC prime minus QC.

00:52:40.300 --> 00:52:43.260
Now here we invoke Clausius.

00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:51.740
Clausius says that if you
see heat going between two

00:52:51.740 --> 00:52:56.720
temperatures, it could have only
gone from the direction hotter

00:52:56.720 --> 00:53:01.300
to colder, which means
that this amount of heat

00:53:01.300 --> 00:53:03.420
has to be positive.

00:53:03.420 --> 00:53:08.550
QH prime should be
greater than QH.

00:53:08.550 --> 00:53:14.550
So this is why Clausius-- we
know that this has to be case.

00:53:19.350 --> 00:53:29.050
So then what I can do, is I can
divide both expressions by W.

00:53:29.050 --> 00:53:31.330
And then invert this thing.

00:53:31.330 --> 00:53:34.840
And if I invert it, the
inequality gets inverted.

00:53:34.840 --> 00:53:42.560
So I get that W over QH
prime is less than W over QH.

00:53:42.560 --> 00:53:48.020
And the left-hand
side is the efficiency

00:53:48.020 --> 00:53:50.630
of my non-Carnot engine.

00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:55.190
And the right-hand side is the
efficiency of my Carnot engine.

00:53:55.190 --> 00:53:59.200
Carnot And what I've shown
is that the efficiency

00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:01.900
of the non-Carnot engine
has to be less than

00:54:01.900 --> 00:54:04.140
or equal to the efficiency
of the Carnot engine.

00:54:07.840 --> 00:54:16.360
OK, now, the next step
is the following--

00:54:16.360 --> 00:54:36.690
that all Carnot engines
operating between TH and TC

00:54:36.690 --> 00:54:37.740
have the same efficiency.

00:54:49.470 --> 00:54:55.620
And the statement is, suppose
I have two different Carnot

00:54:55.620 --> 00:54:58.690
engines-- Carnot engine
one and Carnot engine two.

00:54:58.690 --> 00:55:01.150
I can use one to run
the other one backward,

00:55:01.150 --> 00:55:04.840
and I would get that the
efficiency of Carnot engine one

00:55:04.840 --> 00:55:07.610
is less than or equal to Carnot
engine two, or the other way

00:55:07.610 --> 00:55:10.750
around-- that two is less
than or equal to one.

00:55:10.750 --> 00:55:12.520
And hence, the
only possibility is

00:55:12.520 --> 00:55:17.990
that they are the same, which
is actually interesting,

00:55:17.990 --> 00:55:20.740
because I told you that
Carnot engines are stamped

00:55:20.740 --> 00:55:25.330
by two temperatures, TH and TC.

00:55:25.330 --> 00:55:28.390
And what it says
is that they all

00:55:28.390 --> 00:55:31.510
have an efficiency that
is a function, therefore,

00:55:31.510 --> 00:55:33.710
of these two temperatures only.

00:55:33.710 --> 00:55:37.260
It cannot depend on whether I
constructed my Carnot engine

00:55:37.260 --> 00:55:40.920
out of an ideal gas.

00:55:40.920 --> 00:55:43.260
I constructed it
out of a rubber band

00:55:43.260 --> 00:55:48.040
that I was pulling or pushing,
or any other substance

00:55:48.040 --> 00:55:51.360
in the world that
you can think about,

00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:55.720
as long as that substance I can
construct some kind of a Carnot

00:55:55.720 --> 00:56:01.200
cycle, irrespective of what the
coordinate systems are, what

00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:03.710
the isotherms look
like, et cetera.

00:56:03.710 --> 00:56:07.130
Just working between two
temperatures and two isotherms

00:56:07.130 --> 00:56:11.140
tells me that this
reversible cycle

00:56:11.140 --> 00:56:15.740
will have this efficiency
relating the amount of work

00:56:15.740 --> 00:56:18.550
and the amount of heat
that these exchange as you

00:56:18.550 --> 00:56:19.950
go around.

00:56:19.950 --> 00:56:22.190
OK?

00:56:22.190 --> 00:56:26.340
Now, that's important
because previously we

00:56:26.340 --> 00:56:28.770
wanted to define
our temperature.

00:56:28.770 --> 00:56:33.260
And we had to rely on
some property of the gas.

00:56:33.260 --> 00:56:37.290
We said OK, empirically we
observe that for the gas,

00:56:37.290 --> 00:56:39.940
you have this relationship
that when it is dilute,

00:56:39.940 --> 00:56:45.170
PV is proportional to T and we
use that property of the gas

00:56:45.170 --> 00:56:49.105
to construct our ideal
gas temperature scale.

00:56:49.105 --> 00:56:54.260
Well, that's OK, but it
relies on some observations

00:56:54.260 --> 00:56:57.430
additionally to everything
else that we had.

00:56:57.430 --> 00:57:01.470
Whereas now we have the
means to define temperatures

00:57:01.470 --> 00:57:03.760
irrespective of any material.

00:57:03.760 --> 00:57:06.555
This is much more of
a universal quantity.

00:57:06.555 --> 00:57:08.670
It' doesn't depend
on any substance,

00:57:08.670 --> 00:57:10.640
any particular structure.

00:57:10.640 --> 00:57:14.130
So it's a much
better way to rely

00:57:14.130 --> 00:57:17.190
for constructing a
temperature scale.

00:57:17.190 --> 00:57:22.060
So in some sense, at
least theoretically,

00:57:22.060 --> 00:57:24.690
we are going to abandon
our previous temperature

00:57:24.690 --> 00:57:27.565
scale based on properties
of the ideal gas,

00:57:27.565 --> 00:57:31.717
and reconstruct the temperature
scale based on this.

00:57:31.717 --> 00:57:32.300
Any questions?

00:57:36.050 --> 00:57:37.610
OK.

00:57:37.610 --> 00:57:42.530
So this is what will be called
the thermodynamic temperature

00:57:42.530 --> 00:57:43.030
scale.

00:57:50.020 --> 00:57:56.540
And what it amounts
to is that somehow I

00:57:56.540 --> 00:58:01.100
use the efficiency
between two temperatures

00:58:01.100 --> 00:58:04.960
or vice versa-- use that
there are two temperatures.

00:58:04.960 --> 00:58:07.500
Let's say one of them is
a reference temperature.

00:58:07.500 --> 00:58:11.570
I derive the temperature
of the other one

00:58:11.570 --> 00:58:14.470
by the maximum efficiency
of all engines that

00:58:14.470 --> 00:58:16.660
can operate between
the reference

00:58:16.660 --> 00:58:20.150
temperature and the temperature
that I wish to measure.

00:58:20.150 --> 00:58:21.790
It's T.

00:58:21.790 --> 00:58:24.330
But that means I--
before doing that, I

00:58:24.330 --> 00:58:27.340
need to know at least something,
or some kind of a postulate

00:58:27.340 --> 00:58:31.230
about the structure of this
function of two variables.

00:58:31.230 --> 00:58:35.580
And I cannot write any
arbitrary function.

00:58:35.580 --> 00:58:39.870
It has to satisfy certain
properties and symmetries.

00:58:39.870 --> 00:58:44.430
And I can see what
those properties are

00:58:44.430 --> 00:58:49.320
by putting a couple of
these engines in series.

00:58:49.320 --> 00:58:53.490
So let's imagine that we
have a structure where

00:58:53.490 --> 00:58:57.120
I have the highest
temperature T1,

00:58:57.120 --> 00:59:04.270
and intermediate temperature T2,
and the lowest temperature T3.

00:59:04.270 --> 00:59:09.790
And I put one Carnot engine
to operate between these two

00:59:09.790 --> 00:59:14.510
temperatures, and one to operate
between these temperatures.

00:59:14.510 --> 00:59:18.350
And the first one is
going to take heat

00:59:18.350 --> 00:59:20.374
that I will called Q1.

00:59:25.370 --> 00:59:32.650
And release a heat that I will
call Q2, in the process doing

00:59:32.650 --> 00:59:37.960
a certain amount of work that
I will call W between 1 and 2.

00:59:37.960 --> 00:59:44.820
Now what I will do is I will use
the entirety of that heat, Q2,

00:59:44.820 --> 00:59:50.240
to run the second Carnot
engine to temperature T3,

00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:54.670
reducing here the
amount of heat, Q3,

00:59:54.670 --> 00:59:56.895
and doing a certain
amount of work-- W23.

01:00:00.210 --> 01:00:03.580
Clearly what I want
to do is to say

01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:09.610
that when I look at the
combination of these things,

01:00:09.610 --> 01:00:15.110
what happens at temperature
2 is an intermediate.

01:00:15.110 --> 01:00:19.780
And the whole thing is
equivalent to a Carnot engine

01:00:19.780 --> 01:00:22.570
operating between T1 and T3.

01:00:22.570 --> 01:00:26.830
Again, the whole
thing is reversible,

01:00:26.830 --> 01:00:29.140
operates between
two temperatures,

01:00:29.140 --> 01:00:30.720
and since each
one of them can be

01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:33.660
made to go back to where
they started, is a cycle.

01:00:33.660 --> 01:00:37.764
So the whole thing is really
equivalent to another Carnot

01:00:37.764 --> 01:00:48.770
engine that takes
Q1, deposits Q3, does

01:00:48.770 --> 01:00:51.810
a certain amount
of work, W13, which

01:00:51.810 --> 01:00:54.752
is the sum of W12 plus W23.

01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:02.670
So clearly, these two
different perspectives

01:01:02.670 --> 01:01:05.870
on the same operation
will constrain

01:01:05.870 --> 01:01:09.350
some-- give some
constraint between the form

01:01:09.350 --> 01:01:11.420
of the functions that
will be describing

01:01:11.420 --> 01:01:13.940
the efficiencies
of Carnot engines.

01:01:13.940 --> 01:01:17.270
So let's follow
that mathematically.

01:01:17.270 --> 01:01:22.910
OK, so the first
one-- what do we have?

01:01:22.910 --> 01:01:24.940
By conservation
of energy, I have

01:01:24.940 --> 01:01:31.510
that Q2 is-- so this
is-- let me be precise.

01:01:31.510 --> 01:01:44.100
This is Carnot engine 1-- tells
me that Q2 is Q1 minus W12.

01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:46.240
All right, so how
much heat I have here

01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:48.680
is the difference between
this and the amount of work

01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:51.830
that I did--
conservation of energy.

01:01:51.830 --> 01:01:58.110
W12 is the efficiency times Q.
That was how it was defined.

01:01:58.110 --> 01:02:04.140
So it is 1 minus the efficiency
operating between T1 and T2

01:02:04.140 --> 01:02:05.870
times Q1.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.530
What do we know about
Carnot engine number 2?

01:02:14.260 --> 01:02:17.200
Carnot engine
number 2 says that I

01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:22.920
can look at Q3 as being
the difference between Q2

01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:26.340
minus the work that
is done over here.

01:02:26.340 --> 01:02:30.910
The work is related to the
heat through multiplying

01:02:30.910 --> 01:02:37.070
by the efficiency that is
operating between T2 and T3.

01:02:37.070 --> 01:02:41.690
And if I substitute for Q2
from the first equation, what

01:02:41.690 --> 01:02:42.250
do I get?

01:02:42.250 --> 01:02:47.120
I will get Q2 being Q1,
1 minus efficiency T1,

01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:50.970
T2, multiplying by the
second bracket that

01:02:50.970 --> 01:02:53.590
is 1 minus efficiency T2 T3.

01:03:02.300 --> 01:03:08.180
But I can also look at the
composite Carnot engine-- that

01:03:08.180 --> 01:03:12.330
is the sum total
of them represented

01:03:12.330 --> 01:03:15.030
by the diagram on the right.

01:03:15.030 --> 01:03:18.190
And what that states-- just
writing the whole thing

01:03:18.190 --> 01:03:26.270
same way-- is that this
Q3 is the same as Q1

01:03:26.270 --> 01:03:33.690
minus this amount of W13,
which is the same thing as Q1,

01:03:33.690 --> 01:03:37.528
1 minus the efficiency
between T1 and T3.

01:03:41.930 --> 01:03:46.170
So suddenly you see that
I have two equations that

01:03:46.170 --> 01:03:55.920
relate Q3 and Q1-- essentially
two formulations of this ratio.

01:03:55.920 --> 01:04:08.330
And what that says is that the
efficiency functions calculated

01:04:08.330 --> 01:04:11.930
between pairs of
temperatures, when

01:04:11.930 --> 01:04:16.480
we look at triplet of them,
have to be related by 1 minus

01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:23.200
efficiency between T1 and T3 is
1 minus efficiency between T1

01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:28.582
and T2, 1 minus efficiency
between T2 and T3.

01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:37.080
So when we are constructing
our temperature scale

01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:41.350
based on properties of
this efficiency function,

01:04:41.350 --> 01:04:44.210
we better choose and
efficiency function

01:04:44.210 --> 01:04:46.890
that satisfies this equality.

01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:54.580
And very roughly again, where
did this type of equality

01:04:54.580 --> 01:04:57.550
come from?

01:04:57.550 --> 01:05:05.940
It originated in the fact that
this 1 minus eta was the ratio

01:05:05.940 --> 01:05:08.810
of two Q's.

01:05:08.810 --> 01:05:12.250
This was the ratio
of Q2 over Q1,

01:05:12.250 --> 01:05:14.860
and then the other
one was Q1 over Q3,

01:05:14.860 --> 01:05:16.360
and you would
multiply them, and you

01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:19.520
would get Q2 over Q3, et cetera.

01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:22.790
And that gives you
a hint as to how

01:05:22.790 --> 01:05:25.290
you should construct
this function

01:05:25.290 --> 01:05:28.420
to satisfy the
property that you want.

01:05:28.420 --> 01:05:37.210
If I write the function as the
ratio of some function of T2

01:05:37.210 --> 01:05:40.580
divided by some
function of T1, it

01:05:40.580 --> 01:05:43.380
would cancel in
precisely the same way

01:05:43.380 --> 01:05:46.080
that when you were
multiplying Q2's and Q1's,

01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:48.330
the cancellations occur.

01:05:48.330 --> 01:05:49.580
OK?

01:05:49.580 --> 01:05:54.960
So what I need to
do is to postulate

01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:58.870
that this is of this form.

01:05:58.870 --> 01:06:02.970
And then actually, I'm
free to choose any function

01:06:02.970 --> 01:06:06.620
or form for F that I want.

01:06:06.620 --> 01:06:09.830
So here we need to
make a convention.

01:06:09.830 --> 01:06:12.790
And the convention
that we make--

01:06:12.790 --> 01:06:19.740
so this is-- this
was not required--

01:06:19.740 --> 01:06:22.200
is that this is really the
functional form is linear.

01:06:25.500 --> 01:06:29.090
So this defines for you the
thermodynamic temperature

01:06:29.090 --> 01:06:29.590
scale.

01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:39.390
Yes.

01:06:39.390 --> 01:06:41.890
AUDIENCE: Yes, the
part, the step right

01:06:41.890 --> 01:06:46.650
before the convention, where
you wrote F of T1 over T1,

01:06:46.650 --> 01:06:51.446
is this also an assumption,
or is it a necessity?

01:06:54.870 --> 01:07:00.080
PROFESSOR: I'm,
let's say, 99.9% sure

01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:02.790
that it's a
mathematical necessity.

01:07:02.790 --> 01:07:11.270
I can't-- at this stage, think
of precisely how to make that--

01:07:11.270 --> 01:07:13.810
actually, yes, I
can make that rigor.

01:07:13.810 --> 01:07:20.700
So essentially think of writing
this in the following way-- 1

01:07:20.700 --> 01:07:31.220
minus eta of T1 and T2 equals
to 1 minus eta of T1 and T3,

01:07:31.220 --> 01:07:35.940
1 minus eta of T2 and T3.

01:07:35.940 --> 01:07:36.932
OK?

01:07:36.932 --> 01:07:40.410
The left-hand side
depends on T1 and T2.

01:07:40.410 --> 01:07:44.810
The right-hand side is the
ratio of two functional forms

01:07:44.810 --> 01:07:49.080
involving T1 and T2 precisely
as you have over here,

01:07:49.080 --> 01:07:53.510
as long as you regard
T3 to be some arbitrary

01:07:53.510 --> 01:07:56.460
parameter or constant.

01:07:56.460 --> 01:07:57.300
OK?

01:07:57.300 --> 01:07:59.422
So that's the proof.

01:08:03.278 --> 01:08:07.640
All right, unfortunately,
it's like doing magic.

01:08:07.640 --> 01:08:12.269
Once you reveal the trick, it
becomes not so interesting.

01:08:12.269 --> 01:08:14.077
Yes.

01:08:14.077 --> 01:08:15.702
AUDIENCE: Does that
mean more precisely

01:08:15.702 --> 01:08:20.927
if we assumed that
T2 and T1 using F

01:08:20.927 --> 01:08:23.790
are empirical
temperatures, and we define

01:08:23.790 --> 01:08:28.616
the different temperature to
be F [INAUDIBLE] 2, something

01:08:28.616 --> 01:08:29.588
like that?

01:08:32.100 --> 01:08:37.540
PROFESSOR: OK, what I wanted to
say next maybe answers to that.

01:08:37.540 --> 01:08:39.859
So why don't I give that
answer first, and then

01:08:39.859 --> 01:08:41.210
come back to you?

01:08:41.210 --> 01:08:45.540
Is that so far, we have
defined two temperatures.

01:08:45.540 --> 01:08:48.420
There is the thermodynamic
temperature scale

01:08:48.420 --> 01:08:55.000
based on these efficiencies and
there is one other statement,

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:59.000
which is that this only
defines the ratios.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:02.180
So I need to also pick
a reference temperature.

01:09:07.260 --> 01:09:10.649
And for reference temperature,
I pick the temperature

01:09:10.649 --> 01:09:16.229
of the coexistence
of ice, steam, water,

01:09:16.229 --> 01:09:20.710
to be 273.16 degrees
K, which is what

01:09:20.710 --> 01:09:23.300
I have for the ideal gas scale.

01:09:23.300 --> 01:09:25.340
Because if I don't
do that, I only

01:09:25.340 --> 01:09:29.279
know things up to some
proportionality constant.

01:09:29.279 --> 01:09:35.590
If I say that I pick that
reference temperature, then

01:09:35.590 --> 01:09:41.330
in principle what I could do
is, if somebody gives me a bath,

01:09:41.330 --> 01:09:45.620
I can run a Carnot
engine between that bath

01:09:45.620 --> 01:09:49.210
of unknown temperature
and this reference point,

01:09:49.210 --> 01:09:53.330
calculate the efficiency,
1 minus the efficiency,

01:09:53.330 --> 01:09:56.510
use this ratio--
273.16-- and I have

01:09:56.510 --> 01:09:59.590
the temperature
of my new object.

01:09:59.590 --> 01:10:02.470
So we've completed that
thermodynamic temperature

01:10:02.470 --> 01:10:03.460
scale.

01:10:03.460 --> 01:10:07.160
If I understood correctly
the question that was posed,

01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:12.260
is, well, what about the
empirical temperature?

01:10:12.260 --> 01:10:20.120
And I was going to answer
something different, which

01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:22.060
is not really what
you were asking.

01:10:22.060 --> 01:10:25.922
So maybe you can repeat
your question one more time.

01:10:25.922 --> 01:10:30.610
AUDIENCE: If the, all
of our computations

01:10:30.610 --> 01:10:35.295
where we assume that instead
of T's, there are some thetas.

01:10:35.295 --> 01:10:36.416
PROFESSOR: Right.

01:10:36.416 --> 01:10:41.960
AUDIENCE: And which means
that we use the [INAUDIBLE]

01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:45.710
at last we define the
thermodynamic temperature,

01:10:45.710 --> 01:10:47.502
it seems to have more precise.

01:10:47.502 --> 01:10:48.460
PROFESSOR: That's fine.

01:10:48.460 --> 01:10:53.400
So you're saying that what I
did with the Zeroth Law was

01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:58.350
to state that for somebody that
exists in thermal equilibrium

01:10:58.350 --> 01:11:02.600
with a bath, I can
characterize it with the theta.

01:11:02.600 --> 01:11:04.840
And I can go through
the whole argument

01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:07.450
that I had over here
by constructing,

01:11:07.450 --> 01:11:12.040
let's say, Carnot
engines that operate

01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:16.480
between empirical temperatures
defined as theta H and theta C.

01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:19.610
And nowhere in the
process have I given you

01:11:19.610 --> 01:11:23.850
a number for what theta H and
theta C is up to this point.

01:11:23.850 --> 01:11:27.680
And at this point, I
defined efficiency,

01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:30.040
which I have established
is only a function

01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:33.110
of the empirical temperature
operating between two

01:11:33.110 --> 01:11:37.380
isotherms, as some way
through this process

01:11:37.380 --> 01:11:40.660
and this definition, giving
an actual numerical value.

01:11:40.660 --> 01:11:42.408
So that's fine.

01:11:42.408 --> 01:11:43.356
Yes.

01:11:43.356 --> 01:11:47.622
AUDIENCE: So should you also
define temperature [INAUDIBLE]

01:11:47.622 --> 01:11:50.735
with ideal gas and
infinite expansion?

01:11:50.735 --> 01:11:51.360
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:56.340
AUDIENCE: And doesn't it define
what convention for effective

01:11:56.340 --> 01:11:58.252
we need to pick here?

01:12:01.190 --> 01:12:05.050
So for all the definitions to
be consistent with each other?

01:12:05.050 --> 01:12:07.600
PROFESSOR: OK, so now that
becomes a different question.

01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:09.880
So I think the
first question was,

01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:13.430
let's not define any temperature
scale up to this point.

01:12:13.430 --> 01:12:16.480
And this is the first time that
we define a temperature scale.

01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:17.980
Now, your question
is the one that I

01:12:17.980 --> 01:12:20.230
wanted to originally
answer, so thank you

01:12:20.230 --> 01:12:22.420
for the question, which
is that I actually

01:12:22.420 --> 01:12:26.210
did define for you a temperature
scale through some property

01:12:26.210 --> 01:12:27.670
of the ideal gas.

01:12:27.670 --> 01:12:31.080
And indeed, that
property of the ideal gas

01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:34.710
I implicitly used here in
the shape of the isotherms

01:12:34.710 --> 01:12:38.540
that I had and
constructing this energy

01:12:38.540 --> 01:12:41.430
functional in this fashion.

01:12:41.430 --> 01:12:44.880
Now you say well,
OK, you defined

01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:46.530
temperature two different ways.

01:12:46.530 --> 01:12:48.980
Are they consistent
with each other?

01:12:48.980 --> 01:12:51.520
And you will have
a problem set that

01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:54.160
will ask the following
question-- let's

01:12:54.160 --> 01:13:01.120
run an ideal gas Carnot cycle
between ideal gas temperatures

01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:05.540
theta H and theta C. OK?

01:13:05.540 --> 01:13:08.860
Now you can-- and I
have drawn for you

01:13:08.860 --> 01:13:11.810
the form of this Carnot cycle.

01:13:11.810 --> 01:13:16.420
Using PdV, you can calculate
what amount of work

01:13:16.420 --> 01:13:19.050
goes into this at
different stages.

01:13:19.050 --> 01:13:22.640
And the net work would be
the area of this cycle.

01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:26.180
So W would give you
the area of the cycle.

01:13:26.180 --> 01:13:29.810
You can calculate what QH is.

01:13:29.810 --> 01:13:31.940
And you can calculate
the efficiency

01:13:31.940 --> 01:13:38.810
of this as a function
theta H and theta C.

01:13:38.810 --> 01:13:41.930
And what you will find, if
you do things correctly,

01:13:41.930 --> 01:13:48.770
is that using all of these
definitions for the shapes

01:13:48.770 --> 01:13:51.510
of these isotherms,
you can calculate

01:13:51.510 --> 01:13:53.150
what the efficiency is.

01:13:53.150 --> 01:13:54.910
And the answer for
your efficiency

01:13:54.910 --> 01:13:57.370
will come out to be
theta H minus theta

01:13:57.370 --> 01:14:01.500
C divided by theta H, which is
precisely what you would have

01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:04.780
expected based on
the Carnot cycle.

01:14:04.780 --> 01:14:07.860
So then you can
establish that the ratio

01:14:07.860 --> 01:14:11.910
of theta H to theta C
defined through the ideal gas

01:14:11.910 --> 01:14:16.160
temperature scale is the same
as the ratio of the temperatures

01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:18.640
if you had defined
through the thermodynamic.

01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:23.300
So the two scales, once
you set the same point

01:14:23.300 --> 01:14:26.210
for both of them,
become identical.

01:14:31.580 --> 01:14:34.540
Other questions?

01:14:34.540 --> 01:14:42.690
OK, so we went
through all of this

01:14:42.690 --> 01:14:48.970
in order to ultimately
get back to the story

01:14:48.970 --> 01:14:53.320
that I was constructing at the
beginning of the lecture, which

01:14:53.320 --> 01:15:01.950
was that I'd like to have the
form ultimately for my energy.

01:15:01.950 --> 01:15:04.300
I want to construct the energy.

01:15:04.300 --> 01:15:07.550
And if I was looking only
at mechanical systems,

01:15:07.550 --> 01:15:09.920
and there was no
temperature in the world,

01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:14.300
I would construct it
as sum over i Ji dxi.

01:15:14.300 --> 01:15:16.550
But I know that
that's not enough,

01:15:16.550 --> 01:15:19.120
because there are processes
by which I can change

01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:23.650
the state by not doing any
mechanical work-- go from one

01:15:23.650 --> 01:15:26.460
point in the diagram to
another point in the diagram.

01:15:26.460 --> 01:15:29.860
So there must be something else.

01:15:29.860 --> 01:15:33.600
Now we said that it kind
of makes a lot of sense

01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:38.140
that something else should be
something like a temperature.

01:15:38.140 --> 01:15:40.670
And before that,
really, the only thing

01:15:40.670 --> 01:15:44.440
that we had that was
a form of temperature

01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:48.040
was the ideal gas temperature,
or the empirical temperature

01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:50.330
that we had defined
through the Zeroth Law.

01:15:50.330 --> 01:15:55.710
And neither of them had any
nice connection to heat.

01:15:55.710 --> 01:15:58.330
Through this Carnot
engines, et cetera you

01:15:58.330 --> 01:16:02.400
have established some kind of
a connection between heats,

01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:04.250
temperatures, et cetera.

01:16:04.250 --> 01:16:06.305
And that's why this
thermodynamic temperature

01:16:06.305 --> 01:16:08.210
scale is useful.

01:16:08.210 --> 01:16:10.890
It is independent
of any material.

01:16:10.890 --> 01:16:13.820
And it's really the T
that I should put here.

01:16:13.820 --> 01:16:18.250
And so the next question
is, what should I put here?

01:16:18.250 --> 01:16:22.970
And that will also come
through the Second Law.

01:16:22.970 --> 01:16:27.100
I will develop that mostly
the next time around,

01:16:27.100 --> 01:16:31.620
but I'll give you in the next
two or three minutes a preview.

01:16:31.620 --> 01:16:36.850
So the statement that we
had was that the efficiency

01:16:36.850 --> 01:16:40.190
of any engine is less than
the Carnot engine, right?

01:16:40.190 --> 01:16:44.200
So let's imagine that we
have some kind of a exchange

01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:48.070
process going between TH and TC.

01:16:48.070 --> 01:16:51.330
And there is some
engine-- I don't

01:16:51.330 --> 01:16:58.930
know what that engine is--
that takes heat QH here, QC

01:16:58.930 --> 01:17:01.400
here, and does a
certain amount of work.

01:17:04.590 --> 01:17:14.990
Now I know that W
over QH is less than

01:17:14.990 --> 01:17:19.140
or equal to 1 minus TH over TC.

01:17:22.960 --> 01:17:28.347
And W is really the same
thing as QH minus QC.

01:17:32.010 --> 01:17:34.912
So actually, I could
also have written this

01:17:34.912 --> 01:17:43.380
as 1 minus QC over QH is
less than 1 minus TC over TC.

01:17:43.380 --> 01:17:50.826
I can eliminate the 1,
and rearrange things, yes?

01:17:50.826 --> 01:17:52.820
AUDIENCE: It's TC over TH.

01:17:52.820 --> 01:17:55.550
PROFESSOR: 1 minus TC over
TH, thank you very much.

01:17:58.910 --> 01:18:05.890
Yes, and if you ever
forget-- not that I forgot--

01:18:05.890 --> 01:18:11.440
I miswrote-- but something to
remember is that ultimately,

01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:18.370
I was kind of hinting this--
if you ever forget Q's are

01:18:18.370 --> 01:18:21.960
proportional to T's.

01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:30.260
So what I have is that ideally,
QH will be proportional to TH.

01:18:30.260 --> 01:18:32.940
QC will be proportional to TC.

01:18:32.940 --> 01:18:34.710
So the difference
between them would

01:18:34.710 --> 01:18:37.270
be proportional to
the differences.

01:18:37.270 --> 01:18:41.110
Also, that means that if I were
to rearrange this slightly,

01:18:41.110 --> 01:18:57.450
what I would get is that QH
over TH plus minus QC over TC

01:18:57.450 --> 01:18:58.641
has to be negative.

01:19:01.530 --> 01:19:05.710
So this is just a rearrangement
of the whole thing.

01:19:05.710 --> 01:19:10.350
But this rearrangement--
I wrote this as minus

01:19:10.350 --> 01:19:16.980
QC so as to look at things from
the perspective of the engine.

01:19:16.980 --> 01:19:20.850
So the engine is something
that goes through a cycle.

01:19:20.850 --> 01:19:24.920
As part of that cycle,
it does some work.

01:19:24.920 --> 01:19:27.460
But what this
expression has to do

01:19:27.460 --> 01:19:31.030
is the heat that
goes into the system.

01:19:31.030 --> 01:19:34.770
So I can regard minus
QC as the heat that

01:19:34.770 --> 01:19:40.220
goes into the engine coming from
a reservoir of temperature TC,

01:19:40.220 --> 01:19:42.290
QH going through
the engine, coming

01:19:42.290 --> 01:19:46.530
from a reservoir
of temperature TH.

01:19:46.530 --> 01:19:49.500
And you have a
relation such as this

01:19:49.500 --> 01:19:53.310
because the efficiency
of any type of engine

01:19:53.310 --> 01:19:57.240
has to be less than this
efficiency of the Carnot engine

01:19:57.240 --> 01:20:01.090
that is stamped by the
corresponding temperatures.

01:20:01.090 --> 01:20:03.900
OK, now this is kind of limited.

01:20:03.900 --> 01:20:08.550
And in order to be able to
construct a general formula,

01:20:08.550 --> 01:20:12.140
we need to be able
to make statements

01:20:12.140 --> 01:20:16.640
that's are relevant to
arbitrary complex cycles

01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:20.440
and complex behaviors.

01:20:20.440 --> 01:20:25.960
So what we will
start next time is

01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:29.110
to prove something
that ultimately

01:20:29.110 --> 01:20:31.880
will allow us to
quantify entropy.

01:20:31.880 --> 01:20:38.650
It's called Clausius'
Theorem, which

01:20:38.650 --> 01:20:44.310
states the following-- imagine
some kind of a generalization

01:20:44.310 --> 01:20:49.845
of your engine that takes place
in some multidimensional space.

01:20:49.845 --> 01:20:53.220
So rather than really
thinking about an engine,

01:20:53.220 --> 01:20:56.730
I want to think
about some substance.

01:20:56.730 --> 01:21:00.630
This was an ideal gas run
through some nice cycle.

01:21:00.630 --> 01:21:03.250
But I want to think
about some substance that

01:21:03.250 --> 01:21:07.140
is described by multiple
coordinate system.

01:21:07.140 --> 01:21:11.768
I take the system
from some point A,

01:21:11.768 --> 01:21:15.440
and the only requirement
that I place on it

01:21:15.440 --> 01:21:18.590
is that ultimately,
I do something,

01:21:18.590 --> 01:21:23.070
and I come back to
A. So it is a cycle.

01:21:23.070 --> 01:21:26.340
What I don't even
require is that this

01:21:26.340 --> 01:21:31.590
is a quasistatic process, so
that the intermediate stages

01:21:31.590 --> 01:21:35.820
are well-defined in
this coordinate space--

01:21:35.820 --> 01:21:42.560
OK, so for any arbitrary
cyclic transformation.

01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:47.110
OK, now this
transformation-- we'll do

01:21:47.110 --> 01:21:51.770
is that at various stages--
just like that simple example--

01:21:51.770 --> 01:21:53.500
we'll do work on
the environment,

01:21:53.500 --> 01:21:55.370
take work from the environment.

01:21:55.370 --> 01:21:58.330
But most importantly
from our perspective,

01:21:58.330 --> 01:22:03.300
there will be heat
input into the system

01:22:03.300 --> 01:22:07.290
at various stages of the cycle.

01:22:07.290 --> 01:22:11.410
And I'm going to look at it
from the perspective of what

01:22:11.410 --> 01:22:14.850
goes into the system,
just like in this engine.

01:22:14.850 --> 01:22:18.320
So sometimes maybe this
dQ is negative-- means

01:22:18.320 --> 01:22:21.250
that the system is
really releasing heat,

01:22:21.250 --> 01:22:25.360
just like this engine
was releasing the heat.

01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:29.690
Now, Clausius' Theorem
says that if you integrate

01:22:29.690 --> 01:22:34.120
all around the cycle,
these elements of heat

01:22:34.120 --> 01:22:39.430
that you input to the system
throughout various stages

01:22:39.430 --> 01:22:44.980
of the cyclic transformation,
and divide them by some T.

01:22:44.980 --> 01:22:51.300
And this is kind of something
that needs definition.

01:22:51.300 --> 01:22:54.200
And S is supposed to
parametrize the cycle.

01:22:54.200 --> 01:22:58.580
Let's say S goes from 0 to 1
as you go across the cycle.

01:22:58.580 --> 01:23:00.790
Generalizing that is negative.

01:23:04.330 --> 01:23:08.090
Next time, we will see if this
system is non-equilibrium,

01:23:08.090 --> 01:23:11.850
what exactly I mean
by this T of S.

01:23:11.850 --> 01:23:16.690
And we will see, somehow,
that once I define this,

01:23:16.690 --> 01:23:19.470
by doing part of
this, I can actually

01:23:19.470 --> 01:23:24.610
define an entropy function
integral from A to B dQ over S,

01:23:24.610 --> 01:23:30.020
and complete the definition of
what needs to be put for the Q

01:23:30.020 --> 01:23:36.450
in order to give you an
expression for T. OK.
