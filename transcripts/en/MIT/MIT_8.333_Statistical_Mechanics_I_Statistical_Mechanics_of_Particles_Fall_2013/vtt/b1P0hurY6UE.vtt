00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:21.890
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.330
Let's start.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.470
So last lecture, what we
talked about was limitations

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.280
of classical
statistical mechanics,

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.180
and what I will
contrast with what

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.860
I will talk about today,
which is new version.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.320
The old version of
quantum mechanics,

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.770
which was based on the
observation originally from

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.680
Planck, and then
expanded by Einstein,

00:00:51.680 --> 00:01:01.220
that for a harmonic
oscillator, a frequency omega,

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.850
the energies cannot
take all values.

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.010
But values that are multiples of
the frequency of the oscillator

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.220
and then some integer n.

00:01:17.094 --> 00:01:19.890
What we did with
this observation

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.820
to extract thermal
properties was to simply say

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.600
that we will
construct a partition

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.870
function for the
harmonic oscillator

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:34.382
by summing over all of the
states of e to the minus beta e

00:01:34.382 --> 00:01:38.860
n according to the
formula given above.

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:44.100
Just thinking that
these are allowed states

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.600
of this oscillator-- and
this you can very easily do.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.660
It starts with the
first term and then

00:01:53.660 --> 00:02:01.930
it's a algebraic series, which
will give you that formula.

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.720
Now, if you are sitting
at some temperature t,

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.990
you say that the
average energy that you

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:16.090
have in your system, well,
the formula that you have is

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:22.170
minus the log z by the beta,
which if I apply to the z

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.010
that I have about, essentially
weighs each one of these

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.170
by these Boltzmann weights
by the corresponding energy

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.910
and sums them.

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.740
What we do is we get,
essentially, the contribution

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.660
of the ground state.

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:44.390
Actually, for all intents and
purposes, we can ignore this,

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:45.870
and, hence, this.

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.090
But for completion,
let's have them around.

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.960
And then from what is
in the denominator,

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.520
if you take derivative
with respect to beta,

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.330
you will get a factor
of h bar omega.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:04.010
And then this factor of 1 minus
e to the minus beta h bar.

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.190
Actually, we then additional
e to the minus beta

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.642
h bar omega in here.

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.860
Now, the thing that
we really compare to

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.540
was what happens if we were to
take one more derivative to see

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.870
how much the heat
capacity is that we

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.760
have in the harmonic oscillator.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.070
So basically taking an average
of the raw formula with respect

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.680
to temperature, realizing
that these betas are

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.970
inverse temperatures.

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.896
So derivatives with
respect to t will

00:03:46.896 --> 00:03:48.437
be related to
derivative with respect

00:03:48.437 --> 00:03:52.370
to beta, except that I've will
get an additional factor of 1

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.770
over k bt squared.

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:58.190
So the whole thing I
could write that as kb

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:07.500
and then I had the h bar
omega over kt squared.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.570
And then from these factors,
I had something like e

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:20.275
to the minus e to the
h bar omega over kt.

00:04:20.275 --> 00:04:25.860
E to the h bar omega
over kt minus 1 squared.

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:36.830
So if we were to plug
this function, the heat

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:44.570
capacity in its natural
unit that are this kb, then

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:51.390
as a function of
temperature, we get behavior

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:54.740
that we can actually
express correctly

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.160
in terms of the combination.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.870
You can see always
we get temperature

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.110
in units of kb over h bar omega.

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:06.260
So I can really plug
this in the form of, say,

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:10.897
kt over h bar omega,
which we call t

00:05:10.897 --> 00:05:12.355
to some characteristic
temperature.

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:22.090
And the behavior that we have
is that close to 0 temperatures,

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:24.450
you go to 0
exponentially, because

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:27.690
of essentially the ratio
of these exponentials.

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:31.010
We leave one exponential
in the denominator.

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:34.668
So the gaps that you have
between n equals to 0

00:05:34.668 --> 00:05:39.410
and n equals to 1
translates to behavior

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:42.730
of that at low temperatures
is exponentially

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:45.230
decaying to leading order.

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:55.040
Then, eventually, at
high temperatures,

00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:01.260
you get the classical result
where you saturate to 1.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:05.380
And so you will
have a curve that

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:10.350
has a shift from one
behavior to another behavior.

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:15.320
And the place where
this transition occurs

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:19.220
is when this combination
is of the order of 1.

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:23.030
I'm not saying it's precisely
1, but it's of the order of 1.

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:25.324
So, basically, you have
this kind of behavior.

00:06:28.782 --> 00:06:31.260
OK?

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.740
So we use this curve
to explain the heat

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:39.160
capacity of diatomic gas,
such as the gas in this room,

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:44.800
and why at room temperature, we
see a heat capacity in which it

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.380
appears that the vibrational
degrees of freedom are frozen,

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:50.640
are not contributing anything.

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:54.500
While at temperatures above
the characteristic vibrational

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:57.392
frequency, which for a
gas is of the order of 10

00:06:57.392 --> 00:07:00.940
to the 3 degrees
k, you really get

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:02.680
energy in the
harmonic oscillator

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.120
also in the vibrations.

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.530
And the heat capacity
jumps, because you

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:08.240
have another way
of storing energy.

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:27.510
So the next thing that we asked
was whether this describes also

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:31.990
heat capacity of a solid.

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:38.860
So basically, for
the diatomic gas,

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:42.870
you have two atoms that
are bonded together

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:44.360
into a molecule.

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:47.520
And you consider the
vibrations of that.

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:51.830
You can regard the
solid as a huge molecule

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:54.560
with lots of atoms
joined together.

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.720
And they have vibrations.

00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:00.830
And if you think about all of
those vibrations giving you

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:03.550
something that is
similar to this,

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:06.240
you would conclude that the
heat capacity of a solid

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:09.690
should also have this
kind of behavior.

00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:12.440
Whereas we noted
that in actuality,

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:20.820
the heat capacity of a solid
vanishes much more slowly

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:23.230
at low temperatures.

00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:26.740
And the dependence
at low temperatures

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:28.560
is proportional to t cubed.

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:36.590
So at the end of
last lecture, we

00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:42.820
gave an explanation for
this, which I will repeat.

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:48.000
Again, the picture is that the
solid, like a huge molecule,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.910
has vibrational modes.

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:53.560
But these vibrational
modes cover a whole range

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:56.150
of different frequencies.

00:08:56.150 --> 00:09:04.630
And so if you ask, what
are the frequencies omega

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:20.510
alpha of vibrations of a
solid, the most natural way

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:23.640
to characterize
them is, in fact,

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:29.970
in terms of a wave vector k
that indicates a direction

00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:35.270
for the oscillatory wave that
you set up in the material.

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:47.420
And depending on k, you'll
have different frequencies.

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:54.150
And I said that, essentially,
the longest wave length

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:58.180
corresponding to k equals to
0 is taking the whole solid

00:09:58.180 --> 00:09:59.340
and translating it.

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:03.570
Again, thinking back about the
oxygen molecule, the oxygen

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:06.000
molecule, you have
two coordinates.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.560
It's the relative coordinate
that has the vibration.

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:13.500
And you have a center of mass
coordinate that has no energy.

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:16.030
If you make a molecule
more and more complicated,

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:18.480
you will have more modes,
but you will always

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:22.480
have the 0 mode that
corresponds to the translation.

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:25.010
And that carries over
all the way to the solid.

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:28.500
So there is a mode that
corresponds to translations--

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:31.420
and, in fact, rotations--
that would carry

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:37.940
no energy, and corresponds,
therefore, to 0 frequency.

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:42.690
And then if you start to make
long wavelength oscillations,

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:45.980
the frequency is
going to be small.

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:49.460
And, indeed, what we know
is that we tap on the solid

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:51.830
and you create
sound waves, which

00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:56.360
means that the low-frequency
long wavelength

00:10:56.360 --> 00:11:00.050
modes have a dispersion
relation in which omega

00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:02.090
is proportional to k.

00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:06.340
We can write that as
omega is v times k, where

00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:10.600
v is the velocity of
the sound in the solid.

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:16.230
Now, of course, the shortest
wave length that you can have

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:20.540
is related to the separation
between the atoms in the solid.

00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:23.190
And so, basically,
there's a limit

00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:27.300
to the range of k's that
you can put in your system.

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:29.570
And this linear
behavior is going

00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:34.170
to get modified once you get
towards the age of the solid.

00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:39.100
And the reason I
have alpha here is

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:42.390
because you can have
different polarizations.

00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:45.480
There are three different
possible polarizations.

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:47.820
So in principle,
you will have three

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:51.080
of these curves in
the system hard.

00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:59.720
And these curves could
be very complicated

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:01.980
when you get to the
edge of [INAUDIBLE] zone

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:05.790
and you have to solve
a big dynamical matrix

00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:09.060
in order to extract what
the frequencies are,

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:13.370
if you want to have
the complete spectrum.

00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:17.770
So the solid is a collection of
these harmonic oscillators that

00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:20.180
are, in principle,
very complicated.

00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:26.070
But we have the following.

00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:28.545
So I say, OK, I
have all of these.

00:12:28.545 --> 00:12:31.400
And I want to calculate
at a given temperature

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:34.480
how much energy I
have put in the solid.

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:38.690
So this energy that I
have put in the vibrations

00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:43.180
at some temperature t, assuming
that these vibrations are

00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:47.610
really a collection
of these oscillators.

00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:52.930
Well, what I have to do is
to add up all of these terms.

00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:56.820
There's going to be adding up
all of the h bar omega over 2s

00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:58.920
for all of these.

00:12:58.920 --> 00:12:59.420
OK?

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:02.500
That will give me something
that I will simply call e 0,

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:04.330
because it doesn't
depend on temperature.

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:06.950
Presumably will exist
at 0 temperature.

00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:09.380
And I can even fold
into that whatever

00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:13.300
the value of the potential
energy of the interactions

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:16.670
between the particles
is at 0 temperature.

00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:20.690
What I'm interested in really
is the temperature dependence.

00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:24.500
So I basically take the
formula that I have over there,

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:28.060
and sum over all of
these oscillators.

00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:31.220
These oscillators are
characterized by polarization

00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:33.780
and by the wave vector k.

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:39.560
And then I have, essentially,
h bar omega alpha

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:48.750
of k divided by e to the beta
h bar omega alpha of k minus 1.

00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:53.440
So I have to apply that formula
to this potentially very

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:57.320
complicated set of frequencies.

00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:01.720
The thing is, that according
to the picture that I have over

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:06.920
here, to a 0 order
approximation,

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:10.540
you would say that
the heat capacity is 1

00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:15.190
if you are on this side,
0 if you're on that side.

00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:18.790
What distinguishes
those two sides

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:22.860
is whether the frequency in
combination with temperature

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:25.670
is less than or larger than 1.

00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:31.150
Basically, low frequencies
would end up being here.

00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:33.610
High frequencies would
end up being here.

00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:36.040
And would not contribute.

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:41.150
So for a given temperature,
there is some borderline.

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:45.310
That borderline would
correspond to kt over h bar.

00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:49.630
So let me draw where
that borderline is.

00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:52.600
Kt over h bar.

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:55.770
For a particular temperature,
all of these modes

00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:57.930
are not really contributing.

00:14:57.930 --> 00:15:00.550
All of these modes
are contributing.

00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:03.660
If my temperature
is high enough,

00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:05.880
everything is contributing.

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:09.600
And the total number
of oscillators is 3 n.

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:10.810
It's the number of atoms.

00:15:10.810 --> 00:15:13.490
So essentially, I
will get 3 n times

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:15.790
whatever formula
I have over there.

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:18.010
As a come further
and further down,

00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:20.400
there's some kind of
complicated behavior

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:23.600
as I go through this
spaghetti of modes.

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:27.140
But when I get to low
enough structures,

00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:29.110
then, again, things
become simple,

00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:33.020
because I will only be
sensitive to the modes that

00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:37.260
are described by this
a omega being vk.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:38.040
OK?

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:44.980
So if I'm interested
in t going to 0,

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:48.055
means less than some
characteristic temperature

00:15:48.055 --> 00:15:50.890
that we have to define shortly.

00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:56.270
So let's say, replace this
with t less than some theta

00:15:56.270 --> 00:16:00.140
d that I have to
get for you shortly,

00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:06.930
then I will replace this
with e 0 plus sum over alpha

00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:16.520
and k of h bar v alpha
k e to the beta h bar e

00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:21.890
alpha k minus 1.

00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:22.390
OK?

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:32.080
Now, for simplicity,
essentially I

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:33.700
have to do three different sums.

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:36.300
All of them are the
same up to having

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:40.700
to use different values of
v. Let's just for simplicity

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:45.850
assume that all of the
v alphas are the same v,

00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:48.570
so that I really have
only one velocity.

00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:51.200
There's really no difficulty
in generalizing this.

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:55.140
So let's do this for
simplicity of algebra.

00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:58.360
So if I do that, then
the sum over alpha

00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:00.420
will simply give
me a factor of 3.

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:03.390
There are three possible
polarizations, so I put a 3

00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:05.720
there.

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:08.500
And then I have to do
the summation over k.

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:11.640
Well, what does the
summation over k mean?

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:16.440
When I have a small molecule
for the, let's say, three

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:19.119
or four atoms, then
I can enumerate

00:17:19.119 --> 00:17:21.980
what the different
vibrational states are.

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:27.520
As I go to a large
solid, I essentially

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:32.930
have modes that are
at each value of k,

00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:35.040
but, in reality,
they are discrete.

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:38.400
They are very, very, very,
very finely separated

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:41.390
by a separation that
is of the order of 2

00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:45.110
pi over the size of the system.

00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:49.580
So to ensure that eventually
when you count all of the modes

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:51.550
that you have here,
you, again, end up

00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:56.010
to have of the
order of n states.

00:17:56.010 --> 00:18:00.330
So if that's the case,
this sum, really I

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:04.930
can replace with an integral,
because going from one point

00:18:04.930 --> 00:18:07.320
to the next point does
not make much difference.

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:12.070
So I will have an
integral over k.

00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:15.850
But I have to know how
densely these things are.

00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:19.120
And in one direction
it is 2 pi over l.

00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:21.840
So the density would
be l over 2 pi.

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:23.850
If I look at all
three directions,

00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:26.180
I have to multiply all of them.

00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:28.990
So I will get v
divided by 2 pi cubed.

00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:32.670
So this is the usual
density of states.

00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:39.250
And you go to description
in terms of wave numbers,

00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:42.280
or, later on, in
terms of momentums.

00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:49.071
And what we have here is
this integral h bar v k e

00:18:49.071 --> 00:18:53.352
to the beta h bar v k minus 1.

00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:58.960
OK?

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:03.100
So let's simplify this
a little bit further.

00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:04.880
I have e 0.

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:05.730
I have 3v.

00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:12.650
The integrand only depends
on the magnitude of k,

00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:15.610
so I can take advantage
of that spherical symmetry

00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:22.140
and write this as 4 pi k squared
v k divided by this 8 pi cubed.

00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:31.200
What I can do is I
can also introduce

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:36.270
a factor of beta here,
multiplied by k t.

00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:39.530
Beta k t is 1.

00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:45.890
And if I call this
combination to be x, then what

00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:54.560
I have is k b t x
e to the x minus 1.

00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:02.995
Of course, k is simply
related to x by k

00:20:02.995 --> 00:20:17.970
being x kt over h bar v.

00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:20.700
And so at the next
level of approximation,

00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:25.210
this k squared v k I will write
in terms of x squared v x.

00:20:25.210 --> 00:20:26.550
And so what do I have?

00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:29.080
I have e 0.

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:33.965
I have 3v divided
by 2 pi squared.

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:42.040
Because of this factor of
kt that I will take outside

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:44.890
I have a kt.

00:20:44.890 --> 00:20:47.270
I have a k squared
vk that I want

00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:49.350
to replace with x squared v x.

00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:51.640
And that will give me
an additional factor

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:56.970
of kv over h bar v cubed.

00:20:56.970 --> 00:21:01.020
And then I have an
integral 0 to e 0 v

00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:06.930
x x cubed e to the x minus 1.

00:21:13.035 --> 00:21:17.470
Now, in principle, when I
start with this integration,

00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:23.670
I have a finite range
for k, which presumably

00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:27.680
would translate into
a finite range for x.

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:31.880
But in reality none of
these modes is contributing,

00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:34.430
so I could extend the
range of integration

00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:38.300
all the way to infinity,
and make very small error

00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:40.460
at low temperatures.

00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:43.100
And the advantage of
that is that then this

00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:47.160
becomes a definite integral.

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:50.110
Something that you
can look up in tables.

00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:54.083
And its value is in fact
pi to the fourth over 15.

00:21:57.870 --> 00:22:02.090
So substituting that over
there, what do we have?

00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:12.900
We have that the energy is
e 0 plus 3 divided by 15,

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:17.530
will give me 5, which
turns the 2 into a 10.

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:23.990
I have pi to the fourth
divided by pi squared,

00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:28.450
so there's a pi squared
that will survive out here.

00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:31.515
I have a kt.

00:22:31.515 --> 00:22:39.990
I have kt over h bar v cubed.

00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:41.980
And then I have a
factor of volume.

00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:46.280
But volume is proportional
to the number of particles

00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:50.180
that I have in the system
times the size of my unit cell.

00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:52.760
Let's call that a cubed.

00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:57.230
So this I can write
this as l a cubed.

00:22:57.230 --> 00:23:00.900
Why do I do that is because
when I then take the derivative,

00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:05.250
I'd like to write the heat
capacity per particle.

00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:12.726
So, indeed, if I now take the
derivative, which is de by dt,

00:23:12.726 --> 00:23:18.210
the answer will be
proportional to n and kv.

00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:22.000
The number of particles
and this k v, which

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:28.460
is the function, the
unit of heat capacities.

00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:32.180
The overall dependence
is t to the fourth.

00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:35.800
So when I take derivatives,
I will get 4t cubed.

00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:43.830
That 4 will change the 1 over
10 to 2 pi squared over 5.

00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:49.360
And then I have the
combination kvt h bar

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:54.540
v, and that factor of a
raised to the third power.

00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:57.950
So the whole thing is
proportional to t cubed.

00:23:57.950 --> 00:24:04.090
And the coefficient I will
call theta d for [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:04.090 --> 00:24:11.695
And theta d I have calculated
to be h bar v over a h

00:24:11.695 --> 00:24:14.790
bar v a over k t.

00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:17.276
No, h bar v over a k t.

00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:35.520
So the heat capacity
of the solid

00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:38.960
is going to be proportional,
of course, to n k b.

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:42.620
But most importantly, is
proportional to t cubed.

00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:46.480
And t cubed just came
from this argument

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:48.860
that I need low omegas.

00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:51.310
And how many things
I have at the omega.

00:24:51.310 --> 00:24:55.180
How many frequencies do I
have that are vibrating?

00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:57.550
The number of those
frequencies is essentially

00:24:57.550 --> 00:25:01.760
the size of a cube in k space.

00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:07.040
So it goes like this-- maximum
k cubed in three dimensions.

00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:09.970
In two dimensions, it will
be squared and all of that.

00:25:09.970 --> 00:25:14.110
So it's very easy to figure out
from this dispersion relation

00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:17.180
what the low temperature
behavior of the heat capacity

00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:18.350
has to be.

00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:21.990
And you will see that this
is, in fact, predictive,

00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:24.930
in that later on
in the course, we

00:25:24.930 --> 00:25:29.300
will come an example of where
the heat capacity of a liquid,

00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:34.610
which was helium, was observed
to have this t cubed behavior

00:25:34.610 --> 00:25:38.635
based on that Landau immediately
postulated that there should be

00:25:38.635 --> 00:25:42.290
a phonon-like dispersion
inside that superfluid.

00:25:44.970 --> 00:25:45.470
OK.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.980
So that's the story of the
heat capacity of the solid.

00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:55.770
So we started with a molecule.

00:25:55.770 --> 00:26:00.470
We went from a molecule
into an entire solid.

00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:04.480
The next step that what
I'm going to do is I'm

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:08.140
going to remove the solid
and just keep the box.

00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:16.720
So essentially, they
calculation that I

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:19.530
did, if you think
about it, corresponded

00:26:19.530 --> 00:26:24.000
to having some kind
of a box, and having

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.820
vibrational modes
inside the box.

00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:31.670
But let's imagine that
it is an empty box.

00:26:31.670 --> 00:26:36.170
But we know that even in
empty space we have light.

00:26:36.170 --> 00:26:39.960
So within an empty
box, we can still

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:43.420
have modes of the
electromagnetic field.

00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:51.590
Modes of electromagnetic
field, just like the modes

00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:54.930
of the solid, we
can characterize

00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:58.790
by the direction along
which oscillations travel.

00:27:01.490 --> 00:27:08.220
And whereas for the atoms in the
solid, they have displacement

00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:13.170
and the corresponding momentum
for the electromagnetic field,

00:27:13.170 --> 00:27:15.580
you have the electric field.

00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:19.130
And its conjugate is
the magnetic field.

00:27:19.130 --> 00:27:21.720
And these things
will be oscillating

00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:23.310
to create for you a wave.

00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:31.390
Except that, whereas for
the solid, for each atom

00:27:31.390 --> 00:27:33.410
we had three
possible directions,

00:27:33.410 --> 00:27:37.965
and therefore we had three
branches, for this, since e

00:27:37.965 --> 00:27:40.690
and b have to be
orthogonal to k,

00:27:40.690 --> 00:27:42.710
you really have only
two polarizations.

00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:55.520
But apart from that,
the frequency spectrum

00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:58.270
is exactly the same
as we would have

00:27:58.270 --> 00:28:01.290
for the solids at low
temperature replacing

00:28:01.290 --> 00:28:07.090
to v that we have with
the speed of light.

00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:12.060
And so you would say, OK.

00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:16.570
If I were to calculate
the energy content that

00:28:16.570 --> 00:28:21.740
is inside the box,
what I have to do

00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:28.160
is to sum over all of the
modes and polarizations.

00:28:31.150 --> 00:28:35.550
Regarding each one of these
as a harmonic oscillator,

00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:38.430
going through the system
of quantizing according

00:28:38.430 --> 00:28:41.860
to this old quantum mechanics,
the harmonic oscillators,

00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:44.660
I have to add up the energy
content of each oscillator.

00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:53.920
And so what I have is
this h bar omega of k.

00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:58.470
And then I have
1/2 plus 1 over e

00:28:58.470 --> 00:29:02.910
to the beta h bar
omega of k minus 1.

00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:08.890
And then I can do exactly
the kinds of things

00:29:08.890 --> 00:29:12.880
that I had before,
replacing the sum over k

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:16.280
with a v times an integral.

00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:19.370
So the whole thing
would be, first of all,

00:29:19.370 --> 00:29:22.960
proportional to v, going
from the sum over k

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:24.610
to the integration over k.

00:29:27.410 --> 00:29:33.570
I would have to add all of
these h bar omega over 2s.

00:29:33.570 --> 00:29:37.290
Has no temperature dependence,
so let me just, again, call it

00:29:37.290 --> 00:29:39.150
some e 0.

00:29:39.150 --> 00:29:40.800
Actually, let's
call it epsilon 0,

00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:44.820
because it's more like
an energy density.

00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:48.850
And then I have the sum
over all of the other modes.

00:29:48.850 --> 00:29:50.200
There's two polarisations.

00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:54.260
So as opposed to the three
that I had before, I have two.

00:29:54.260 --> 00:30:00.150
I have, again, the
integral over k of 4 pi k

00:30:00.150 --> 00:30:04.600
squared v k divided
by 8 pi cubed, which

00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:08.370
is part of this density
of state calculation.

00:30:08.370 --> 00:30:17.030
I have, again, a
factor of h bar omega.

00:30:17.030 --> 00:30:21.500
Now, I realize that
my omega is ck.

00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:25.130
So I simply write
it as h bar ck.

00:30:25.130 --> 00:30:30.850
And then I have e to the
beta h bar ck minus 1.

00:30:37.490 --> 00:30:44.710
So we will again allow this
to go from 0 to infinity.

00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:47.010
And what do we get?

00:30:47.010 --> 00:30:55.890
We will get v epsilon 0 plus,
well, the 8 and 8 cancel.

00:30:55.890 --> 00:30:59.570
I have pi over pi squared.

00:30:59.570 --> 00:31:01.640
So pi over pi cubed.

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:03.445
So it will give me
1 over pi squared.

00:31:07.170 --> 00:31:10.175
I have one factor of kt.

00:31:13.310 --> 00:31:16.460
Again, when I
introduce here a beta

00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:20.279
and then multiply by kt,
so that this dimension,

00:31:20.279 --> 00:31:21.320
this combination appears.

00:31:25.330 --> 00:31:29.305
Then I have, if I were to
change variable and call

00:31:29.305 --> 00:31:33.730
this the new variable,
I have factor

00:31:33.730 --> 00:31:39.010
of k squared dk, which
gives me, just as

00:31:39.010 --> 00:31:43.870
before over there, a factor
of kt over h bar c cubed.

00:31:49.150 --> 00:31:53.710
And then I have
this integral left,

00:31:53.710 --> 00:32:01.780
which is the 0 to infinity v
x x cubed e to the x minus 1,

00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:06.194
which we stated is pi
to the fourth over 15.

00:32:11.810 --> 00:32:19.130
So the part that is dependent
on temperature, the energy

00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:24.450
content, just as in this case,
scales as t to the fourth.

00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:31.540
There is one part
that we have over here

00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:35.975
from all of the 0s, which
is, in fact, an infinity.

00:32:39.540 --> 00:32:44.260
And maybe there is some
degree of worry about that.

00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:49.940
We didn't have to worry about
that infinity in this case,

00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:55.420
because the number of modes that
we had was, in reality, finite.

00:32:55.420 --> 00:33:01.190
So once we were to add up
properly all of these 0 point

00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:04.050
energies for this, we would
have gotten a finite number.

00:33:04.050 --> 00:33:07.540
It would have been large, but
it would have been finite.

00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:11.990
Whereas here, the difference
is that there is really

00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:14.170
no upper cut-off.

00:33:14.170 --> 00:33:21.780
So this k here, for a solid,
you have a minimum wavelength.

00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:25.710
You can't do things shorter than
the separation of particles.

00:33:25.710 --> 00:33:30.860
But for light, you can have
arbitrarily short wavelength,

00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:34.690
and that gives you this
infinity over here.

00:33:34.690 --> 00:33:37.310
So typically, we ignore that.

00:33:37.310 --> 00:33:40.640
Maybe it is related to the
cosmological constant, et

00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:41.540
cetera.

00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:46.090
But for our purposes, we are not
going to focus on that at all.

00:33:46.090 --> 00:33:48.150
And the interesting
part is this part,

00:33:48.150 --> 00:33:52.110
that proportional
to t to the fourth.

00:33:52.110 --> 00:33:55.090
There are two SOP
calculations to this

00:33:55.090 --> 00:33:58.280
that I will just give
part of the answer,

00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:00.110
because another
part of the answer

00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:05.730
is something that you
do in problem sets.

00:34:05.730 --> 00:34:09.989
One of them is that what we
have here is an energy density.

00:34:09.989 --> 00:34:12.260
It's proportional to volume.

00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:14.989
And we have seen
that energy densities

00:34:14.989 --> 00:34:17.770
are related to pressures.

00:34:17.770 --> 00:34:20.134
So indeed, there is a
corresponding pressure.

00:34:23.030 --> 00:34:26.139
That is, if you're
at the temperature t,

00:34:26.139 --> 00:34:33.190
this collection of vibrating
electromagnetic fields

00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:37.429
exerts a pressure on the
walls of the container.

00:34:37.429 --> 00:34:44.120
This pressure is related
to energy density.

00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:49.870
The factor of 1/3 comes because
of the dispersion relation.

00:34:49.870 --> 00:34:52.620
And you can show that in
one of the problem sets.

00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:54.719
You know that already.

00:34:54.719 --> 00:34:56.400
So that would say
that you would have,

00:34:56.400 --> 00:35:00.200
essentially, something
like some kind of p 0.

00:35:02.930 --> 00:35:07.860
And then something that
is proportional to t

00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:09.190
to the fourth.

00:35:09.190 --> 00:35:12.760
So I guess the correspondent
coefficient here

00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:28.200
would be p squared divided by
45 kt kt over h bar c cubed.

00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:31.620
So there is radiation
pressure that

00:35:31.620 --> 00:35:33.790
is proportional to temperature.

00:35:33.790 --> 00:35:38.160
The hotter you make this box,
the more pressure it will get

00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:40.560
exerted from it.

00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:42.730
There is, of course,
again this infinity

00:35:42.730 --> 00:35:45.140
that you may worry about.

00:35:45.140 --> 00:35:48.640
But here the problem
is less serious,

00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:51.280
because you would
say that in reality,

00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:53.980
if I have the wall
of the box, it

00:35:53.980 --> 00:35:57.740
is going to get pressure
from both sides.

00:35:57.740 --> 00:36:00.437
And if there's an infinite
pressure from both sides,

00:36:00.437 --> 00:36:01.145
they will cancel.

00:36:01.145 --> 00:36:04.390
So you don't have
to worry about that.

00:36:04.390 --> 00:36:06.450
But it turns out
that, actually, you

00:36:06.450 --> 00:36:10.470
can measure the consequences
of this pressure.

00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:16.450
And that occurs when rather
than having one plate,

00:36:16.450 --> 00:36:19.380
you have two plates
that there are

00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:22.940
some small separation apart.

00:36:22.940 --> 00:36:25.040
Then the modes of
radiation that you

00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:29.830
can fit in here because of the
quantizations that you have,

00:36:29.830 --> 00:36:34.470
are different from the modes
that you can have out here.

00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:39.160
So that difference, even from
the 0 point fluctuations--

00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:42.840
the h bar omega over
2s-- will give you

00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:46.700
a pressure that pushes
these plates together.

00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:50.280
That's called a Casimir
force, or Casimir pressure.

00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:54.520
And that was predicted
by Casimir in 1950s,

00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:59.150
and was measured experimentally
roughly 10 years ago

00:36:59.150 --> 00:37:03.070
to high precision, matching
the formula that we had.

00:37:03.070 --> 00:37:06.050
So sometimes, these
infinities have

00:37:06.050 --> 00:37:09.330
consequences that you
have to worry about.

00:37:09.330 --> 00:37:12.580
But that's also to
indicate that there's

00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:16.250
kind of modern physics to this.

00:37:16.250 --> 00:37:20.590
But really it was the
origin of quantum mechanics,

00:37:20.590 --> 00:37:24.580
because of the other aspect
of the physics, which

00:37:24.580 --> 00:37:29.200
is imagine that again
you have this box.

00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:32.760
I draw it now as
an irregular box.

00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:37.740
And I open a hole of
size a inside the box.

00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:41.990
And then the radiation that
was inside at temperatures t

00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:46.400
will start to go out.

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:48.070
So you have a hot box.

00:37:48.070 --> 00:37:49.350
You open a hole in it.

00:37:49.350 --> 00:37:52.450
And then the radiation
starts to come out.

00:37:52.450 --> 00:37:58.103
And so what you will have
is a flux of radiation.

00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:08.390
Flux means that this it energy
that is escaping per unit area

00:38:08.390 --> 00:38:11.320
and per unit time.

00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:18.010
So there's a flux, which
is per area per time.

00:38:18.010 --> 00:38:21.610
It turns out that
that flux-- and this

00:38:21.610 --> 00:38:25.750
is another factor,
this factor of 1/3

00:38:25.750 --> 00:38:29.030
that I mentioned--
is related the energy

00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:34.500
density with a
factor of 1 c over 4.

00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:39.730
Essentially, clearly the
velocity with which energy

00:38:39.730 --> 00:38:43.210
escaping is proportional to c.

00:38:43.210 --> 00:38:47.760
So you will get more
radiation flux the larger c.

00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:50.470
The answer has to be
proportional to c.

00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:53.250
And it is what is
inside that is escaping,

00:38:53.250 --> 00:38:56.350
so it has to be proportional
to the energy density

00:38:56.350 --> 00:39:02.270
that you have inside, some
kind of energy per unit volume.

00:39:02.270 --> 00:39:08.000
And the factor of 1/4 is one
of these geometric factors.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.920
Essentially, there's two
factors of cosine of theta.

00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:13.960
And you have to do an average
of cosine squared theta.

00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:18.720
And that will give you
the additional 1/4.

00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:19.770
OK?

00:39:19.770 --> 00:39:23.620
But rather than
looking-- so this

00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:26.700
would tell you that there is an
energy that is streaming out.

00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:29.510
That is, the net value
is proportional to t

00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:30.820
to the fourth.

00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:35.040
But more interestingly,
we can ask

00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:39.880
what is the flux per wavelength?

00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:42.980
And so for that, I can
just go back to the formula

00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:46.260
before I integrated
over k, and ask

00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:51.440
what is the energy density
in each interval of k?

00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:56.350
And so what I have to do is to
just go and look at the formula

00:39:56.350 --> 00:40:00.190
that I have prior to doing
the integration over k.

00:40:00.190 --> 00:40:02.720
Multiply it by c over 4.

00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:04.130
What do I have?

00:40:04.130 --> 00:40:09.460
I have 8 pi divided
by 8 pi cubed.

00:40:09.460 --> 00:40:14.550
I have a factor of k squared
from the density of states.

00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:23.270
I have this factor of h bar c
k divided by e to the beta h

00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:25.350
bar c k minus 1.

00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:38.190
So there's no analogue of
this, because I am not doing

00:40:38.190 --> 00:40:41.220
the integration over k.

00:40:41.220 --> 00:40:45.470
So we can simplify some
of these factors up front.

00:40:45.470 --> 00:40:49.000
But really, the story is
how does this quantity

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:53.970
look as the function
of wave number, which

00:40:53.970 --> 00:40:57.500
is the inverse of wave
length, if you like.

00:40:57.500 --> 00:41:02.480
And what we see is that when
k goes to 0, essentially,

00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:05.740
this factor into
the beta h bar ck

00:41:05.740 --> 00:41:08.210
I have to expand
to lowest order.

00:41:08.210 --> 00:41:12.430
I will get beta h bar c k,
because the 1 disappears.

00:41:12.430 --> 00:41:15.160
H bar ck is cancelled, so
the answer is going to be

00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:17.070
proportional to inverse beta.

00:41:17.070 --> 00:41:20.840
It's going to be proportional
to kt and k squared.

00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:25.830
So, essentially, the low
k behavior part of this

00:41:25.830 --> 00:41:32.650
is proportional to k squared
c, of course, and kt.

00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:43.300
However, when I go to
the high k numbers,

00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:46.190
the exponential will
kill things off.

00:41:46.190 --> 00:41:49.740
So the large k part
of this is going

00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:51.370
to be exponentially small.

00:41:55.570 --> 00:41:59.580
And, actually, the curve will
look something like this,

00:41:59.580 --> 00:42:02.400
therefore.

00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:08.770
It will have a maximum around
the k, which presumably

00:42:08.770 --> 00:42:17.100
is of the order of
kt over h bar c.

00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:26.410
So basically, the
hotter you have,

00:42:26.410 --> 00:42:29.990
this will move to the right.

00:42:29.990 --> 00:42:34.060
The wavelengths
will become shorter.

00:42:34.060 --> 00:42:39.890
And, essentially, that's the
origin of the fact that can you

00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:45.200
heat some kind of material, it
will start to emit radiation.

00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:48.720
And the radiation will be
peaked at some frequency that

00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:52.210
is related to its temperature.

00:42:52.210 --> 00:42:56.910
Now, if we didn't have
this quantization effect,

00:42:56.910 --> 00:43:01.960
if h bar went to 0,
then what would happen

00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:07.720
is that this k squared kt
would continue forever.

00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:08.380
OK?

00:43:08.380 --> 00:43:10.590
Essentially, you
would have in each one

00:43:10.590 --> 00:43:13.470
of these modes of
radiation, classically,

00:43:13.470 --> 00:43:15.610
you would put a kt of energy.

00:43:15.610 --> 00:43:19.520
And since you could have
arbitrarily short wavelengths,

00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:23.170
you would have infinite
energy at shorter and shorter

00:43:23.170 --> 00:43:24.080
wavelengths.

00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:26.370
And you would have this
ultraviolet catastrophe.

00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:33.750
Of course, the
shape of this curve

00:43:33.750 --> 00:43:38.490
was experimentally known towards
the end of the 19th century.

00:43:38.490 --> 00:43:42.020
And so that was the basis
of thinking about it,

00:43:42.020 --> 00:43:43.980
and fitting an
exponential to the end,

00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:47.980
and eventually deducing
that this quantization

00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:50.900
of the oscillators would
potentially give you

00:43:50.900 --> 00:43:52.375
the reason for this to happen.

00:43:57.610 --> 00:44:01.060
Now, the way that I
have described it,

00:44:01.060 --> 00:44:05.430
I focused on having a cavity
and opening the cavity,

00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:08.720
and having the energy go out.

00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:12.260
Of course, the
experiments for black body

00:44:12.260 --> 00:44:13.870
are not done on cavities.

00:44:13.870 --> 00:44:17.430
They're done on some piece
of metal or some other thing

00:44:17.430 --> 00:44:18.580
that you heat up.

00:44:18.580 --> 00:44:21.730
And then you can look at the
spectrum of the radiation.

00:44:21.730 --> 00:44:24.590
And so, again, there
is some universality

00:44:24.590 --> 00:44:29.070
in this, that it is not so
sensitive to the properties

00:44:29.070 --> 00:44:31.650
of the material,
although there are

00:44:31.650 --> 00:44:34.010
some emissivity and
other factors that

00:44:34.010 --> 00:44:36.900
multiply the final result.

00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:38.820
So the final result,
in fact, would

00:44:38.820 --> 00:44:42.860
say that if I were to
integrate over frequencies,

00:44:42.860 --> 00:44:53.340
the total radiation flux,
which would be c over 4 times

00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:57.190
the energy density
total, is going

00:44:57.190 --> 00:44:59.070
to be proportional
to temperature

00:44:59.070 --> 00:45:01.730
to the fourth power.

00:45:01.730 --> 00:45:16.010
And this constant in front
is the Stefan-Boltzmann,

00:45:16.010 --> 00:45:23.570
which has some particular
value that you can look up,

00:45:23.570 --> 00:45:28.066
units of watts per area
per degrees Kelvin.

00:45:33.870 --> 00:45:40.300
So this perspective
is rather macroscopic.

00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:44.970
The radiated energy is
proportional to the surface

00:45:44.970 --> 00:45:46.720
area.

00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:50.130
If you make things
that are small,

00:45:50.130 --> 00:45:53.610
and the wavelengths that you're
looking at over here become

00:45:53.610 --> 00:45:56.160
compatible to the
size of the object,

00:45:56.160 --> 00:45:59.160
these formulas break down.

00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:04.000
And again, go forward
about 150 years or so,

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:08.120
there is ongoing research--
I guess more 200 years--

00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:11.430
ongoing research on--
no, 100 and something--

00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:18.550
ongoing research on how these
classical laws of radiation

00:46:18.550 --> 00:46:22.340
are modified when you're dealing
with objects that are small

00:46:22.340 --> 00:46:25.011
compared to the wavelengths
that are emitted, etc.

00:46:35.002 --> 00:46:35.585
Any questions?

00:46:38.950 --> 00:46:47.810
So the next part of the story
is why did you do all of this?

00:46:47.810 --> 00:46:51.400
It works, but what
is the justification?

00:46:54.960 --> 00:47:00.960
In that I said there was
the old quantum mechanics.

00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:06.840
But really, we want to have
statements about quantum

00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:11.050
systems that are not
harmonic oscillators.

00:47:11.050 --> 00:47:14.890
And we want to be able
to understand actually

00:47:14.890 --> 00:47:18.540
what the underlying
basis is in the same way

00:47:18.540 --> 00:47:21.190
that they understand
how we were doing things

00:47:21.190 --> 00:47:25.420
for classical
statistical mechanics.

00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:28.660
And so really, we
want to look at how

00:47:28.660 --> 00:47:32.564
to make the transition
from classical to quantum

00:47:32.564 --> 00:47:33.480
statistical mechanics.

00:47:39.850 --> 00:47:44.910
So for that, let's
go and remind us.

00:47:44.910 --> 00:47:47.010
Actually, so
basically the question

00:47:47.010 --> 00:47:49.920
is something like
this-- what does

00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:53.810
this partition function mean?

00:47:53.810 --> 00:47:57.110
I'm calculating
things as if I have

00:47:57.110 --> 00:47:59.590
these states that are
the energy levels.

00:47:59.590 --> 00:48:05.080
And the probabilities are e
to the minus beta epsilon n.

00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:06.320
What does that mean?

00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:09.640
Classically, we knew
the Boltzmann rates

00:48:09.640 --> 00:48:12.390
had something to do with
the probability of finding

00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:17.500
a particle with a particular
position and momentum.

00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:20.340
So what is the
analogous thing here?

00:48:20.340 --> 00:48:23.570
And you know that in
new quantum mechanics,

00:48:23.570 --> 00:48:26.830
the interpretation of many
things is probabilistic.

00:48:29.350 --> 00:48:32.490
And in statistical
mechanics, even classically

00:48:32.490 --> 00:48:35.610
we had a probabilistic
interpretation.

00:48:35.610 --> 00:48:40.020
So presumably, we want to
build a probabilistic theory

00:48:40.020 --> 00:48:43.580
on top of another
probabilistic theory.

00:48:43.580 --> 00:48:46.480
So how do we go
about understanding

00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:49.950
precisely what is
happening over here?

00:48:49.950 --> 00:48:53.840
So let's kind of
remind ourselves

00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:58.400
of what we were doing in the
original classical statistical

00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:01.740
mechanics, and try to
see how we can make

00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:03.930
the corresponding
calculations when

00:49:03.930 --> 00:49:06.900
things are quantum mechanical.

00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:11.210
So, essentially, the
probabilistic sense

00:49:11.210 --> 00:49:15.150
that we had in classical
statistical mechanics

00:49:15.150 --> 00:49:18.790
was to assign probabilities
for micro states, given

00:49:18.790 --> 00:49:21.950
that we had some knowledge
of the macro state.

00:49:21.950 --> 00:49:39.350
So the classical
microstate mu was a point

00:49:39.350 --> 00:49:44.368
which was a collection of
p's and q's in phase space.

00:49:51.690 --> 00:50:01.000
So what is a quantum microstate?

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:01.500
OK.

00:50:01.500 --> 00:50:13.160
So here, I'm just going to jump
several decades ahead, and just

00:50:13.160 --> 00:50:14.570
write the answer.

00:50:14.570 --> 00:50:17.560
And I'm going to
do it in somewhat

00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:21.369
of a more axiomatic way,
because it's not up to me

00:50:21.369 --> 00:50:22.660
to introduce quantum mechanics.

00:50:22.660 --> 00:50:25.190
I assume that you
know it already.

00:50:25.190 --> 00:50:28.010
Just a perspective
that I'm going to take.

00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:40.020
So the quantum microstate
is a complex unit vector

00:50:40.020 --> 00:50:40.880
in Hilbert space.

00:50:47.810 --> 00:50:49.440
OK?

00:50:49.440 --> 00:51:00.770
So for any vector space, we can
choose a set of unit vectors

00:51:00.770 --> 00:51:02.710
that form an orthonormal basis.

00:51:09.028 --> 00:51:13.630
And I'm going to use
this bra-ket notation.

00:51:13.630 --> 00:51:20.580
And so our psi, which is
a vector in this space,

00:51:20.580 --> 00:51:25.680
can be written in
terms of its components

00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:30.160
by pointing to the different
directions in this space,

00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:37.790
and components that I will
indicate by this psi n.

00:51:37.790 --> 00:51:40.650
And these are complex.

00:51:45.500 --> 00:51:51.810
And I will use the
notation that psi n

00:51:51.810 --> 00:51:55.630
is the complex
conjugate of n psi.

00:51:58.980 --> 00:52:06.480
And the norm of this I'm going
to indicate by psi psi, which

00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:12.260
is obtained by summing over
all n psi psi n star, which

00:52:12.260 --> 00:52:17.280
is essentially the
magnitude of n psi squared.

00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:20.190
And these are unit vectors.

00:52:20.190 --> 00:52:23.240
So all of these states
are normalized such

00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:25.960
that psi psi is equal to 1.

00:52:31.130 --> 00:52:32.260
Yes.

00:52:32.260 --> 00:52:35.397
AUDIENCE: You're not
allowing particle numbers

00:52:35.397 --> 00:52:36.770
to vary, are you?

00:52:36.770 --> 00:52:38.150
PROFESSOR: At this stage, no.

00:52:38.150 --> 00:52:40.820
Later on, when we do
the grand canonical,

00:52:40.820 --> 00:52:43.850
we will change
our Hilbert space.

00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:00.220
OK?

00:53:00.220 --> 00:53:03.030
So that's one concept.

00:53:03.030 --> 00:53:06.820
The other concept,
classically, we measure things.

00:53:06.820 --> 00:53:08.690
So we have classical observable.

00:53:17.100 --> 00:53:23.720
And these are
functions all of which

00:53:23.720 --> 00:53:27.750
depend on this p and
q in phase space.

00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:36.510
So basically, there's
the phase space.

00:53:36.510 --> 00:53:39.270
We can have some
particular function,

00:53:39.270 --> 00:53:42.670
such as the kinetic energy--
sum over i pi squared

00:53:42.670 --> 00:53:46.220
over 2 n-- that's an
example of an observable.

00:53:46.220 --> 00:53:49.920
Kinetic energy, potential
energy, anything that we like,

00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:52.440
you can classically
write a sum function

00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:54.880
that you want to
evaluate in phase space,

00:53:54.880 --> 00:53:57.740
given that you are at some
particular point in phase

00:53:57.740 --> 00:54:02.720
space, the state of your system,
you can evaluate what that is.

00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:10.850
Now in quantum
mechanics, observables

00:54:10.850 --> 00:54:29.260
are operators, or matrices, if
you like, in this vector space.

00:54:29.260 --> 00:54:30.650
OK?

00:54:30.650 --> 00:54:37.310
So among the
various observables,

00:54:37.310 --> 00:54:39.210
certainly, are things
like the position

00:54:39.210 --> 00:54:41.760
and the momentum
of the particle.

00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:43.670
So there are presumably
matrices that

00:54:43.670 --> 00:54:47.850
correspond to
position and momentum.

00:54:47.850 --> 00:54:52.830
And for that, we look
at some other properties

00:54:52.830 --> 00:54:56.650
that this classical
systems have.

00:54:56.650 --> 00:55:03.210
We had defined classically
a Poisson bracket,

00:55:03.210 --> 00:55:10.940
which was a sum over all
alphas d a by d q alpha

00:55:10.940 --> 00:55:21.145
d b by d p alpha minus the a
by the p alpha b d by the q f.

00:55:21.145 --> 00:55:21.645
OK?

00:55:24.500 --> 00:55:29.210
And this is an
operation that you

00:55:29.210 --> 00:55:33.050
would like to, and happens
to, carry over in some sense

00:55:33.050 --> 00:55:37.220
into quantum mechanics.

00:55:37.220 --> 00:55:40.000
But one of the
consequence of this

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:45.470
is you can check if I pick
a particular momentum, key,

00:55:45.470 --> 00:55:52.840
and a particular coordinate,
q, and put it over here, most

00:55:52.840 --> 00:55:57.140
of the time I will get 0,
unless the alphas match

00:55:57.140 --> 00:56:00.540
exactly the p q's
that I have up there.

00:56:00.540 --> 00:56:02.940
And if you go through
this whole thing,

00:56:02.940 --> 00:56:08.610
I will get something like
that is like a delta i j.

00:56:08.610 --> 00:56:10.610
OK.

00:56:10.610 --> 00:56:16.590
So this structure somehow
continues in quantum mechanics,

00:56:16.590 --> 00:56:22.050
in this sense that the matrices
that correspond to p and q

00:56:22.050 --> 00:56:33.240
satisfy the condition
that p i and q j,

00:56:33.240 --> 00:56:38.200
thinking of two matrices,
and this is the commutator,

00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:50.786
so this is p i q j minus q j
p i is h bar over i delta h.

00:56:57.570 --> 00:57:04.710
So once you have the matrices
that correspond to p and q,

00:57:04.710 --> 00:57:11.370
you can take any function of p
and q that you had over here,

00:57:11.370 --> 00:57:16.510
and then replace the p's and
q's that appear in, let's say,

00:57:16.510 --> 00:57:20.020
a series expansion, or an
expansion of this o in powers

00:57:20.020 --> 00:57:24.840
of p and q, with corresponding
matrices p hat and q hat.

00:57:24.840 --> 00:57:28.980
And that way, you will construct
a corresponding operator.

00:57:28.980 --> 00:57:32.240
There is one subtlety that
you've probably encountered,

00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:34.480
in that there is
some symmetrization

00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:38.130
that you have to do before
you can make this replacement.

00:57:40.770 --> 00:57:42.070
OK.

00:57:42.070 --> 00:57:45.386
So what does it mean?

00:57:45.386 --> 00:57:51.130
In classical theory, if
something is observable

00:57:51.130 --> 00:57:52.720
the answer that you
get is a number.

00:57:52.720 --> 00:57:53.220
Right?

00:57:53.220 --> 00:57:56.180
You can calculate what
the kinetic energy is.

00:57:56.180 --> 00:57:59.030
In quantum mechanics,
what does it

00:57:59.030 --> 00:58:03.600
mean that observable
is a matrix?

00:58:03.600 --> 00:58:06.530
The statement is
that observables

00:58:06.530 --> 00:58:15.210
don't have definite values,
but the expectation value

00:58:15.210 --> 00:58:22.310
of a particular observable
o in some state pi

00:58:22.310 --> 00:58:26.340
is given by psi o psi.

00:58:26.340 --> 00:58:31.010
Essentially, you take the vector
that correspond to the state,

00:58:31.010 --> 00:58:34.520
multiply the matrix on
it, and then sandwich it

00:58:34.520 --> 00:58:36.850
with the conjugate
of the vector,

00:58:36.850 --> 00:58:38.365
and that will give
you your state.

00:58:38.365 --> 00:58:43.880
So in terms of elements
of some particular basis,

00:58:43.880 --> 00:58:47.610
you would write this
as a sum over n and m.

00:58:47.610 --> 00:58:53.200
Psi n n o m m psi.

00:58:57.280 --> 00:59:02.820
And in that particular
basis, your operator

00:59:02.820 --> 00:59:04.630
would have these
matrix elements.

00:59:07.160 --> 00:59:10.970
Now again, another
property, if you're

00:59:10.970 --> 00:59:13.630
measuring something
that is observable,

00:59:13.630 --> 00:59:17.200
is presumably you will
get a number that is real.

00:59:17.200 --> 00:59:21.450
That is, you expect this
to be the same thing

00:59:21.450 --> 00:59:24.790
as its complex conjugate.

00:59:24.790 --> 00:59:27.940
And if you follow
this condition,

00:59:27.940 --> 00:59:34.490
you will see that that reality
implies that n o m should

00:59:34.490 --> 00:59:41.940
m o n complex conjugate,
which is typically written

00:59:41.940 --> 00:59:46.039
as the matrix being its
Hermitian conjugate,

00:59:46.039 --> 00:59:46.830
or being Hermitian.

00:59:51.190 --> 00:59:54.510
So all observables
in quantum mechanics

00:59:54.510 --> 00:59:58.665
would correspond to Hermitian
operators or matrices.

01:00:01.761 --> 01:00:02.260
OK.

01:00:04.810 --> 01:00:06.730
There's one other
piece, and then we

01:00:06.730 --> 01:00:14.430
can forget about axioms.

01:00:14.430 --> 01:00:19.950
We have a classical
time evolution.

01:00:26.930 --> 01:00:30.530
We know that the particular
point in the classical phase

01:00:30.530 --> 01:00:33.410
space changes as a
function of time, such

01:00:33.410 --> 01:00:40.440
that q i dot is
plus d h by d p i.

01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:46.190
P i dot is minus d h by d q i.

01:00:46.190 --> 01:00:49.920
By the way, both of these
can be written as q i

01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:55.630
and h Poisson bracket and
p i and h Poisson bracket.

01:00:55.630 --> 01:01:01.720
But there is a particular
function observable, h,

01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:07.660
the Hamiltonian, that derives
the classical evolution.

01:01:07.660 --> 01:01:13.800
And when we go to
quantum evolution,

01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:19.480
this vector that we have in
Hilbert space evolves according

01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:26.550
to i h bar d by dt
of the vector psi

01:01:26.550 --> 01:01:30.716
is the matrix that we
have acting on psi.

01:01:34.900 --> 01:01:36.541
OK.

01:01:36.541 --> 01:01:37.040
Fine.

01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:40.584
So these are the
basics that we need.

01:01:40.584 --> 01:01:45.880
Now we can go and do
statistical descriptions.

01:01:53.100 --> 01:02:04.540
So the main element that we
had in constructing statistical

01:02:04.540 --> 01:02:07.666
descriptions was deal
with a macrostate.

01:02:15.850 --> 01:02:18.440
We said that if I'm
interested in thinking

01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:22.760
about the properties of
one cubic meter of gas

01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:25.960
at standard temperature
and pressure,

01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:29.340
I'm not thinking about a
particular point in phase

01:02:29.340 --> 01:02:32.020
space, because
different gases that

01:02:32.020 --> 01:02:35.300
have exactly the same
macroscopic properties would

01:02:35.300 --> 01:02:38.100
correspond to many, many
different possible points

01:02:38.100 --> 01:02:42.060
in this phase space that are
changing as a function of time.

01:02:42.060 --> 01:02:47.850
So rather than thinking
about a single microstate,

01:02:47.850 --> 01:02:50.740
we talked about an ensemble.

01:02:50.740 --> 01:03:00.280
And this ensemble had a whole
bunch of possible microstates.

01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:02.340
In the simplest
prescription, maybe we

01:03:02.340 --> 01:03:06.280
said they were all
equally likely.

01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:09.560
But, actually, we could even
assign some kind of probability

01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:10.060
to them.

01:03:13.740 --> 01:03:19.430
And we want to know what to do
with this, because then what

01:03:19.430 --> 01:03:24.130
happened was from
this description,

01:03:24.130 --> 01:03:31.150
we then constructed a
density which was, again,

01:03:31.150 --> 01:03:36.170
some kind of a probability
in phase space.

01:03:36.170 --> 01:03:38.690
And we looked at
its time evolution.

01:03:38.690 --> 01:03:42.140
We looked at the averages
and all kinds of things

01:03:42.140 --> 01:03:45.250
in terms of this density.

01:03:45.250 --> 01:03:50.340
So the question is, what
happens to all of this

01:03:50.340 --> 01:03:55.070
when we go to
quantum descriptions?

01:03:55.070 --> 01:03:55.930
OK.

01:03:55.930 --> 01:03:58.700
You can follow a lot of that.

01:03:58.700 --> 01:04:04.640
We can, again, take the example
of the one cubic meter of gas

01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:07.430
at standard temperature
and pressure.

01:04:07.430 --> 01:04:11.380
But the rather than describing
the state of the system

01:04:11.380 --> 01:04:13.750
classically, I can
try to describe it

01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:15.930
quantum mechanically.

01:04:15.930 --> 01:04:18.140
Presumably the quantum
mechanical description

01:04:18.140 --> 01:04:21.930
at some limit becomes equivalent
to the classical description.

01:04:21.930 --> 01:04:28.005
So I will have an
ensemble of states.

01:04:30.820 --> 01:04:33.940
I don't know which
one of them I am in.

01:04:33.940 --> 01:04:35.360
I have lots of boxes.

01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:39.710
They would correspond to
different microstates,

01:04:39.710 --> 01:04:41.480
presumably.

01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:45.790
And this has,
actually, a word that

01:04:45.790 --> 01:04:48.010
is used more in the
quantum context.

01:04:48.010 --> 01:04:50.400
I guess one could use it
in the classical context.

01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:53.570
It's called a mixed state.

01:04:53.570 --> 01:04:57.270
A pure state is one
you know exactly.

01:04:57.270 --> 01:05:00.740
Mixed state is, well,
like the gas I tell you.

01:05:00.740 --> 01:05:03.430
I tell you only the
macroscopic information,

01:05:03.430 --> 01:05:06.340
you don't know much about
microscopically what it is.

01:05:06.340 --> 01:05:09.470
If these are possibilities,
and not knowing

01:05:09.470 --> 01:05:11.510
those possibilities,
you can say that it's

01:05:11.510 --> 01:05:14.960
a mixture of all these states.

01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:16.830
OK.

01:05:16.830 --> 01:05:21.490
Now, what would I use,
classically, a density for?

01:05:21.490 --> 01:05:24.700
What I could do is
I could calculate

01:05:24.700 --> 01:05:34.530
the average of some observable,
classically, in this ensemble.

01:05:34.530 --> 01:05:37.990
And what I would do
is I would integrate

01:05:37.990 --> 01:05:43.470
over the entirety of the six
n-dimensional phase space

01:05:43.470 --> 01:05:47.850
the o at some particular
point in phase space

01:05:47.850 --> 01:05:51.540
and the density at that
point in phase space.

01:05:51.540 --> 01:05:56.920
And this average I
will indicate by a bar.

01:05:56.920 --> 01:06:03.770
So my bars stand for
ensemble average,

01:06:03.770 --> 01:06:08.100
to make them distinct from
these quantum averages

01:06:08.100 --> 01:06:11.880
that I will indicate
with the Bra-Kets.

01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:14.180
OK?

01:06:14.180 --> 01:06:20.880
So let's try to do the analogue
of that in quantum states.

01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:25.740
I would say that, OK, for a
particular one of the members

01:06:25.740 --> 01:06:28.410
of this ensemble,
I can calculate

01:06:28.410 --> 01:06:30.410
what the expectation value is.

01:06:33.260 --> 01:06:37.310
This is the
expectation value that

01:06:37.310 --> 01:06:42.800
corresponds to this observable
o, if I was in a pure state psi

01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:44.620
alpha.

01:06:44.620 --> 01:06:48.370
But I don't know
that I am there.

01:06:48.370 --> 01:06:52.780
I have a probability,
so I do a summation

01:06:52.780 --> 01:06:54.850
over all of these states.

01:06:54.850 --> 01:06:58.660
And I will call that expectation
value ensemble average.

01:07:03.930 --> 01:07:07.770
So that's how
things are defined.

01:07:07.770 --> 01:07:11.280
Let's look at this in
some particular basis.

01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:19.780
I would write this as a sum
over alpha m and n p alpha psi

01:07:19.780 --> 01:07:28.350
alpha m m o n n psi alpha.

01:07:28.350 --> 01:07:33.060
So, essentially, writing
all of these psis

01:07:33.060 --> 01:07:38.290
in terms of their components,
just as I had done above.

01:07:38.290 --> 01:07:39.920
OK.

01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:44.080
Now what I want to do
is to reorder this.

01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:48.350
Do the summation
over n and m first,

01:07:48.350 --> 01:07:50.380
the summation over alpha last.

01:07:50.380 --> 01:07:52.395
So what do I have?

01:07:52.395 --> 01:07:57.670
I have m o n.

01:07:57.670 --> 01:08:06.850
And then I have a sum over
alpha of p alpha n psi alpha

01:08:06.850 --> 01:08:07.810
psi alpha n.

01:08:14.290 --> 01:08:23.359
So what I will do, this quantity
that alpha is summed over--

01:08:23.359 --> 01:08:26.939
so it depends on the
two indices n and m.

01:08:26.939 --> 01:08:28.550
I can give it a name.

01:08:28.550 --> 01:08:31.430
I can call it n rho m.

01:08:35.550 --> 01:08:41.600
If I do that, then this o
bar average becomes simply--

01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:43.819
let's see.

01:08:43.819 --> 01:08:50.560
This summation over n gives
me the matrix product o rho.

01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:54.790
And then summation over m gives
me the trace of the product.

01:08:54.790 --> 01:08:57.221
So this is the trace of rho o.

01:08:59.987 --> 01:09:02.300
OK?

01:09:02.300 --> 01:09:09.850
So I constructed
something that is

01:09:09.850 --> 01:09:16.260
kind of analogous
to the classical use

01:09:16.260 --> 01:09:20.930
of the density in phase space.

01:09:20.930 --> 01:09:23.850
So you would multiply
the density and the thing

01:09:23.850 --> 01:09:28.310
that you wanted to
calculate the observable.

01:09:28.310 --> 01:09:31.290
And the ensemble
average is obtained

01:09:31.290 --> 01:09:34.710
as a kind of summing over
all possible what values

01:09:34.710 --> 01:09:37.550
of that product in phase space.

01:09:37.550 --> 01:09:40.729
So here, I'm doing
something similar.

01:09:40.729 --> 01:09:45.109
I'm multiplying this
o by some matrix row.

01:09:45.109 --> 01:09:52.370
So, again, this I can think
of as having introduced

01:09:52.370 --> 01:09:55.630
a new matrix for an operator.

01:09:55.630 --> 01:09:57.510
And this is the density matrix.

01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:12.910
And if I basically
ignore, or write it

01:10:12.910 --> 01:10:16.610
in basis-independent
form, it is obtained

01:10:16.610 --> 01:10:20.620
by summing over all
alphas the alphas,

01:10:20.620 --> 01:10:23.710
and, essentially,
cutting off the n and m.

01:10:23.710 --> 01:10:31.710
I have the matrix that I would
form out of state alpha by,

01:10:31.710 --> 01:10:35.370
essentially, taking the
vector and its conjugate

01:10:35.370 --> 01:10:41.710
and multiplying rows and columns
together to make a matrix.

01:10:41.710 --> 01:10:44.790
And then multiplying or
averaging that matrix

01:10:44.790 --> 01:10:48.270
over all possible
values of the ensemble--

01:10:48.270 --> 01:10:52.640
elements of the ensemble--
would give me this density.

01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:59.060
So in the same way
that any observable

01:10:59.060 --> 01:11:07.200
in classical mechanics goes
over to an operator in quantum

01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:10.920
mechanics, we find that
we have another function

01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:13.260
in phase space-- this density.

01:11:13.260 --> 01:11:17.320
This density goes over to the
matrix or an operator that

01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:18.770
is given by this formula here.

01:11:21.330 --> 01:11:26.958
It is useful to enumerate
some properties of the density

01:11:26.958 --> 01:11:27.458
matrix.

01:11:44.940 --> 01:11:55.150
First of all, the density
matrix is positive definite.

01:11:55.150 --> 01:11:56.492
What does that mean?

01:11:56.492 --> 01:12:01.430
It means that if you
take the density matrix,

01:12:01.430 --> 01:12:07.780
multiply it by any state
on the right and the left

01:12:07.780 --> 01:12:12.780
to construct a number, this
number will be positive,

01:12:12.780 --> 01:12:16.570
because if I apply it to the
formula that I have over there,

01:12:16.570 --> 01:12:19.750
this is simply sum
over alpha p alpha.

01:12:19.750 --> 01:12:25.910
Then I have phi psi
psi alpha, and them

01:12:25.910 --> 01:12:29.440
psi alpha psi, which is
its complex conjugate.

01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:34.690
So I get the norm of that
product, which is positive.

01:12:34.690 --> 01:12:39.140
All of the p alphas are
positive probabilities.

01:12:39.140 --> 01:12:43.890
So this is certainly
something that is positive.

01:12:43.890 --> 01:12:50.780
We said that anything that
makes sense in quantum mechanics

01:12:50.780 --> 01:12:51.850
should be Hermitian.

01:12:55.720 --> 01:12:58.630
And it is easy to check.

01:12:58.630 --> 01:13:02.350
That if I take this
operator rho and do

01:13:02.350 --> 01:13:06.010
the complex conjugate,
essentially what happens

01:13:06.010 --> 01:13:08.540
is that I have to
take sum over alpha.

01:13:08.540 --> 01:13:11.520
Complex conjugate of p
alpha is p alpha itself.

01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:14.270
Probabilities are real numbers.

01:13:14.270 --> 01:13:19.940
If I take psi alpha psi alpha
and conjugate it, essentially

01:13:19.940 --> 01:13:21.510
I take this and put it here.

01:13:21.510 --> 01:13:23.450
And I take that and
put it over there.

01:13:23.450 --> 01:13:24.985
And I get the same thing.

01:13:24.985 --> 01:13:26.620
So it's the same thing as rho.

01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:32.706
And, finally, there's
a normalization.

01:13:41.720 --> 01:13:48.170
If, for my o over here in
the last formula, I choose 1,

01:13:48.170 --> 01:13:52.790
then I get the
expectation value of 1

01:13:52.790 --> 01:13:57.050
has to be the trace of rho.

01:13:57.050 --> 01:14:00.250
And we can check that
the trace of rho,

01:14:00.250 --> 01:14:02.760
essentially, is
obtained by summing over

01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:08.960
all alpha p alpha, and the dot
product of the two psi alphas.

01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:13.280
Since any state in
quantum mechanics

01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:17.660
corresponds to a unit
vector, this is 1.

01:14:17.660 --> 01:14:21.532
So I get a sum over
alpha of p alphas.

01:14:21.532 --> 01:14:24.280
And these are
probabilities assigned

01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:25.830
to the members of the ensemble.

01:14:25.830 --> 01:14:28.060
They have to add up to 1.

01:14:28.060 --> 01:14:30.010
And so this is like this.

01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:40.960
So the quantity that
we were looking at,

01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:46.600
and built, essentially, all of
our later classical statistical

01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:50.500
mechanics, on is this density.

01:14:50.500 --> 01:14:54.630
Density was a probability
in phase space.

01:14:54.630 --> 01:14:56.810
Now, when you go to
quantum mechanics,

01:14:56.810 --> 01:14:58.360
we don't have phase space.

01:14:58.360 --> 01:15:00.650
We have Hilbert space.

01:15:00.650 --> 01:15:03.680
We already have a
probabilistic theory.

01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:07.450
Turns out that this
function, which

01:15:07.450 --> 01:15:10.240
was the probability in
phase space classically,

01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:15.080
gets promoted to this matrix,
the density matrix, that has,

01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:17.990
once you take traces and
do all kinds of things,

01:15:17.990 --> 01:15:21.020
the kinds of properties that
you would expect the probability

01:15:21.020 --> 01:15:22.660
to have classically.

01:15:22.660 --> 01:15:26.200
But it's not really
probability in the usual sense.

01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:28.810
It's a matrix.

01:15:28.810 --> 01:15:31.060
OK.

01:15:31.060 --> 01:15:37.350
There is one other thing
element of this to go through,

01:15:37.350 --> 01:15:44.450
which is that
classically, we said

01:15:44.450 --> 01:15:49.670
that, OK, I pick
a set of states.

01:15:49.670 --> 01:15:52.170
They correspond to some density.

01:15:52.170 --> 01:15:55.960
But the microstates are
changing as a function of time.

01:15:55.960 --> 01:15:59.510
So the density was changing
as a function of time.

01:15:59.510 --> 01:16:07.190
And we had Liouville's
theorem, which

01:16:07.190 --> 01:16:15.625
stated that d rho by d t
was the Poisson bracket

01:16:15.625 --> 01:16:17.810
of the Hamiltonian with rho.

01:16:20.860 --> 01:16:24.700
So we can quantum
mechanically ask,

01:16:24.700 --> 01:16:28.630
what happens to
our density matrix?

01:16:28.630 --> 01:16:33.290
So we have a matrix rho.

01:16:33.290 --> 01:16:38.400
I can ask, what is the time
derivative of that matrix?

01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:44.870
And, actually, I will
insert the i h bar here,

01:16:44.870 --> 01:16:51.130
because I anticipate
that, essentially,

01:16:51.130 --> 01:16:56.820
rho having that form, what I
will have is sum over alpha.

01:16:56.820 --> 01:17:06.870
And then I have i h bar d by
dt acting on these p alpha psi

01:17:06.870 --> 01:17:08.560
alpha psi f.

01:17:11.080 --> 01:17:15.860
So there rho is sum over alpha
p alpha psi alpha psi alpha.

01:17:15.860 --> 01:17:19.110
Sum over alpha p alpha
I can take outside.

01:17:19.110 --> 01:17:23.520
I h bar d by dt acts
on these two psis

01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:26.590
that are appearing a
complex conjugates.

01:17:26.590 --> 01:17:30.180
So it can either, d by dt,
act on one or the other.

01:17:30.180 --> 01:17:33.240
So I can write this
as sum over alpha p

01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:45.320
alpha i h bar d by dt acting
on psi alpha psi alpha, or i,

01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:56.466
or psi alpha, and then i h bar d
by dt acting on this psi alpha.

01:18:02.370 --> 01:18:08.060
Now, i h bar d by
dt psi alpha, we

01:18:08.060 --> 01:18:13.620
said that, essentially, the
quantum rule for time evolution

01:18:13.620 --> 01:18:16.490
is i h bar d by dt
of the state will

01:18:16.490 --> 01:18:21.656
give you is governed by h
times acting on psi alpha.

01:18:24.830 --> 01:18:31.220
If I were to take the complex
conjugate of this expression,

01:18:31.220 --> 01:18:35.690
what I would get
is minus i h bar

01:18:35.690 --> 01:18:39.020
d by dt acting on
psi that is pointing

01:18:39.020 --> 01:18:42.080
the other way of our
complex conjugation

01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:49.770
is h acting on the psi
in the opposite way.

01:18:49.770 --> 01:19:05.493
So this thing is minus psi
alpha with h f acting on it.

01:19:09.270 --> 01:19:10.520
OK.

01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:22.020
So then I can write the whole
thing as h-- for the first term

01:19:22.020 --> 01:19:24.230
take the h out front.

01:19:24.230 --> 01:19:28.140
I have a sum over
alpha p alpha psi alpha

01:19:28.140 --> 01:19:37.000
psi alpha, minus, from this
complex conjugation-- here, h

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:40.740
is completely to the right--
I have a sum over alpha

01:19:40.740 --> 01:19:45.380
p alpha psi alpha psi alpha.

01:19:45.380 --> 01:19:46.969
And then we have h.

01:19:49.690 --> 01:19:51.825
Now, these are again
getting rho back.

01:19:56.463 --> 01:20:04.490
So what I have established
is that i h bar, the time

01:20:04.490 --> 01:20:08.420
derivative of this
density matrix,

01:20:08.420 --> 01:20:15.800
is simply the commutator
of the operators h and o.

01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:31.140
So what we had up here was the
classical Liouville theorem,

01:20:31.140 --> 01:20:35.050
relating the time derivative
of the density in phase space

01:20:35.050 --> 01:20:37.860
to the Poisson bracket with h.

01:20:37.860 --> 01:20:41.430
What we have here is the
quantum version, where

01:20:41.430 --> 01:20:45.220
the time derivative
of this density matrix

01:20:45.220 --> 01:20:47.580
is the commutator of rho with h.

01:20:52.340 --> 01:20:59.550
Now we are done, because what
did we use this Liouville for?

01:20:59.550 --> 01:21:04.290
We used it to deduce that if
I have things that are not

01:21:04.290 --> 01:21:10.090
changing as a function of time,
I have equilibrium systems,

01:21:10.090 --> 01:21:12.590
where the density is invariant.

01:21:12.590 --> 01:21:14.180
It's the same.

01:21:14.180 --> 01:21:21.490
Then rho of equilibrium not
changing as a function of time

01:21:21.490 --> 01:21:27.440
can be achieved by simply
making it a function of h.

01:21:27.440 --> 01:21:32.940
And, more precisely, h
and conserved quantities

01:21:32.940 --> 01:21:36.100
that have 0 Poisson
bracket with h.

01:21:43.700 --> 01:21:47.330
How can I make the
quantum density matrix

01:21:47.330 --> 01:21:50.810
to be invariant of time?

01:21:50.810 --> 01:21:54.440
All I need to do is to ensure
that the Poisson bracket

01:21:54.440 --> 01:21:58.350
of that density with
the Hamiltonian is 0.

01:21:58.350 --> 01:22:01.300
Not the Poisson
bracket, the commutator.

01:22:01.300 --> 01:22:04.560
Clearly, the commutator
of h with itself is 0.

01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:07.510
Hh minus hh is 0.

01:22:07.510 --> 01:22:12.390
So this I can make
a function of h,

01:22:12.390 --> 01:22:15.270
and any other kind
of quantity also

01:22:15.270 --> 01:22:18.610
that has 0 commutator with h.

01:22:18.610 --> 01:22:22.100
So, essentially, the quantum
version also applies.

01:22:22.100 --> 01:22:26.810
That is, the quantum
version of rho equilibrium,

01:22:26.810 --> 01:22:30.350
I can make it by
constructing something

01:22:30.350 --> 01:22:34.420
that depends on
the Hilbert space

01:22:34.420 --> 01:22:36.460
through the dependence
of the Hamiltonian

01:22:36.460 --> 01:22:41.730
and on the Hilbert space and any
other conserved quantities that

01:22:41.730 --> 01:22:45.436
have 0 commutator also
with the Hamiltonian.

01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:53.130
So now, what we
will do next time

01:22:53.130 --> 01:22:55.900
is we can pick and choose
whatever rho equilibrium

01:22:55.900 --> 01:22:56.680
we had before.

01:22:56.680 --> 01:22:59.560
Canonical e to the minus beta h.

01:22:59.560 --> 01:23:02.930
We make this matrix to
be e to the minus beta h.

01:23:02.930 --> 01:23:06.710
Uniform anything, we
can just carry over

01:23:06.710 --> 01:23:10.160
whatever functional dependence
we had here to here.

01:23:10.160 --> 01:23:13.240
And we are ensure
to have something

01:23:13.240 --> 01:23:16.280
that is quantum
mechanically invariant.

01:23:16.280 --> 01:23:21.120
And we will then interpret
what the various quantities

01:23:21.120 --> 01:23:25.620
calculated through that
density matrix and the formulas

01:23:25.620 --> 01:23:29.060
that we described actually.

01:23:29.060 --> 01:23:30.575
OK?
