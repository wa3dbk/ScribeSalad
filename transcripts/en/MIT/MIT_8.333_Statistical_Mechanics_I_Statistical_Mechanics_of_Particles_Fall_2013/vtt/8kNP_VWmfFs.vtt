00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.680
PROFESSOR: So we've been
developing the procedure

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.610
to describe a quantum gas
of identical particles.

00:00:38.335 --> 00:00:39.460
That's our non-interacting.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.390
So what does that mean?

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.940
Is that we are thinking
about the Hamiltonian

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.860
for a system of N particles.

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.240
If they are not
interacting, it can

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.990
be written as the sum
of the contributions

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.590
for the individual particles.

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.750
And if they are
identical, it's basically

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.360
the same particle
for each one of them.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.600
Same Hamiltonian for
each one of them.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.840
OK?

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.420
How do we handle these?

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.870
Well, if you regard this
as a quantum problem,

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.400
for a single particle--
so for each one

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.680
of these Hamiltonians-- we
can find the eigenstates.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.790
So there's a bunch of states
that say label by k because we

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.300
are ultimately have in
mind the plane waves that

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:41.040
describe gas particles in a box.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.540
And there is corresponding
energy levels

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.020
for the single
particles, epsilon k.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.180
And the single particle
spectrum can therefore

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:58.230
can be described by a bunch
of energies, a lot of energy

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.980
levels, with
different values of k

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:06.790
and different allowed
discretized energies.

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.390
Now, when we want to describe
a case of N particles

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.930
that are
non-interacting, we said

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.250
that we could, in
principle, pick one k here,

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.550
one k here, one k here.

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.580
And if we are
dealing with bosons,

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.500
potentially more than
one at each side.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.550
And so the state would
then be described

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:36.190
by a bunch of
occupation numbers Nk.

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.890
And this Nk will be 0 or 1 if
you are talking about fermions,

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.280
but any integer if you
are talking about bosons.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.900
So this eta being
plus or minus was

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.162
used to distinguish
appropriate symmetrization

00:02:49.162 --> 00:02:50.120
or anti-symmetrization.

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.820
Now, once we have a
state such as this,

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:02.110
clearly the N
particle hamintonium

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.385
acting on a state
that is symmetrized

00:03:05.385 --> 00:03:09.180
with these bunch of
occupation numbers

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.900
will give us back this state.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.830
The energy that we
would be getting

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.890
is summing over all
possible k values, epsilon k

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:25.850
times the number of occurrance
of that in this state.

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:27.970
Again, multiplying
this state back.

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:39.400
Of course, we have a constraint
that the number of particles

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.070
matches the sum of the
occupation numbers.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.600
So then we said,
OK, this is just

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.930
a description of the state
that they want to describe,

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.600
or the set of states
that represent

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.950
this system of identical
non-interacting partners

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:05.960
in quantum mechanics.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.700
So the next stage, we want to
do some kind of first statistics

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.100
for them.

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.830
And we had seen that
basically, in order

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:19.320
to assign appropriate statistics
in case of quantum systems,

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.670
we have to deal with
a density matrix.

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:26.660
And we saw that in the
canonical representation,

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.480
the density matrix
is complicated

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.850
and amounts to some kind of
interaction among particles.

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.930
Although there is no
interaction at this level,

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.620
the symmetrization or
anti-symmetrization

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.960
create states that are
intermixed in a manner that

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.080
appears as if you
have an interaction.

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.850
We found that, however,
we could get rid of that

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:59.960
by going to the grand canonical
ensemble where we would trade

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.440
in the constraint that
the number of particles

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.820
is fixed with a
chemical potential.

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:14.150
And in this ensemble, we
found that the density matrix

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.320
is diagonal in this
representation.

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.090
So the diagonal
elements can be thought

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:25.620
of as the probability of one of
these occupation number sets.

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:32.400
And so the probability of a
particular set of occupations

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.690
in this grand
canonical prescription

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:40.680
is proportional to e
to the beta-- of course

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:46.860
we have mu if we are going to
this grand canonical ensemble--

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:53.610
minus epsilon k,
and then we had Nk.

00:05:53.610 --> 00:06:00.720
So the probability that
a particular one of these

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:06.360
is occupied Nk times in this
grand canonical prescription

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.180
is simply an exponential.

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:12.280
And of course, the
different k levels

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.440
are completely
independent of each other.

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.900
So the probability factor
arises in this fashion.

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:22.200
Of course, as any probability,
we have to normalize this.

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:26.120
Normalization is appropriate.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.560
We call the grand canonical
partition function

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.640
and will be different
whether we are dealing

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:34.460
with boson statistics
or fermion statistics.

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:43.880
Actually, because we have
a structure such as this,

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:47.330
Q is going to be the
product of the normalization

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:50.290
of each individual one.

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:55.705
And therefore, log
of Q is going to be

00:06:55.705 --> 00:06:58.970
a sum of the
contributions that I

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:02.960
would get for the normalization
of each individual ones.

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:06.150
And of course, the log
of whatever normalization

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:09.280
I have for the individual one.

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:16.780
If I have the case of a fermions
where Nk gets 0 or 1 as the two

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:19.700
possibilities, then
the normalization

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:24.510
will be simply 1 plus
this exponential.

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:28.773
And I choose to write that
as z e to the minus beta

00:07:28.773 --> 00:07:34.566
epsilon of k where
I have introduced z

00:07:34.566 --> 00:07:36.900
to be e to the beta mu.

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:40.030
Because this combination
occurs all the time,

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:44.270
I don't want to
keep repeating that.

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:47.570
So this was for the
case of fermions.

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:52.630
For the case of bosons where
N goes 0, 1, 2, 3, et cetera,

00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:55.180
this is a geometric series.

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:59.250
For the geometric
series, when I sum it,

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:01.910
I would get 1 over this factor.

00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:06.910
So when I take the log I
will have a minus sign here.

00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:10.290
And I can put the
Boson and Fermi cases

00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:14.290
together by simply putting
a factor of minus eta

00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:18.990
here so that I have the plus
for the case of fermions

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:22.724
and the minus for
the case of bosons.

00:08:22.724 --> 00:08:25.610
OK?

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:30.000
So this is one thing
that we will be using.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.370
The other thing is that
this is the probability

00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:38.299
for this level having a
certain occupation number.

00:08:38.299 --> 00:08:43.441
In k we can always ask,
what is the average of Nk?

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:52.290
And from this probability it is
easy to calculate the average.

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:55.100
And the answer, again,
can be collapsed

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:59.160
into one expression for the
case of bosons and fermions

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:07.600
as 1 over z inverse e to the
beta epsilon of k minus eta

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:11.800
encompassing both
fermions and bosons.

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:23.760
So these results give some idea
both at the microscopic level--

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:28.060
in terms of occupation numbers
of these different levels--

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:31.090
and macroscopic level a
grand partition function

00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:34.130
from which we can
construct thermodynamics.

00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:36.030
Actually, full
probability, again,

00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:39.560
in this ensemble which we
can transform in principle

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:43.410
and get density matrices,
et cetera, in other basis.

00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:45.940
But these are the
kinds of things

00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:51.390
that we can do for any
interacting Hamiltonian.

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:54.390
OK?

00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:58.370
Now, what I said over
here was that I'm actually

00:09:58.370 --> 00:09:59.905
interested in the case of a gas.

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:07.670
So let's again think
about the type of gas

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:10.660
such as the one in this
room that we are interested.

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:14.070
And again, to make a
contrast with something

00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:16.370
that we may want
to do later, let's

00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:19.090
emphasize that it is a
non-relativistic gas.

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:35.530
So the Hamiltonian H is
essentially free particle

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:39.100
in a box of volume
V, the thing that we

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:41.090
have been using
all the time, just

00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:44.160
the kinetic energy of
a one particle state.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:48.170
And for that we know that
the single particle energy

00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:53.090
levels are characterized
by a vector k.

00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:55.330
As three components, in fact.

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:59.600
And h bar squared
over 2mk squared.

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:02.590
And we've discussed what
the discretization of k

00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:06.070
is appropriate to
the size of the box.

00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:07.500
We won't go over that.

00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:13.590
So again, maybe it is
important to mention

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:17.630
that because of the
discretizatoin of the k values,

00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:20.145
the spacing between
possible values of k

00:11:20.145 --> 00:11:23.270
are 2 pi over l
in each direction.

00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:25.510
And ultimately
what we want to do

00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:33.280
is to replace these sums over
k's in the limit of large boxes

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:35.620
with integrals over k.

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:41.790
So these go over to an
integral over k times

00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:45.920
the density factor that you
get in going from the sum

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:50.490
to the integral, which is 2
pi cubed times the volume.

00:11:55.050 --> 00:12:01.020
I will introduce one
other factor here,

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:04.710
which is that when we
are talking about quantum

00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:10.010
particles and
bosons and fermions,

00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:16.050
they are typically assigned
also another state--

00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:19.790
another parameter-- that
characterizes their spin.

00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:23.430
And depending on the
possible values of spin,

00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:27.270
you will have g
copies of the system.

00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:32.680
And this g will be related
to the quantum spin--

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:38.020
to the formula 2s 1-- so
that when you have fermions,

00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:42.440
typically s is half integer and
this will be an even number.

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:46.730
Whereas for bosons it
will be an odd number.

00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:48.720
So that's, again,
something that we've seen.

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:51.610
You just, essentially
says multiply everything

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:53.021
by some factor of g.

00:12:55.970 --> 00:12:57.720
Now if I go through
this procedure

00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:01.180
that I have outlined
here, I will ultimately

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:05.015
get the grand partition
function of the gas-- which

00:13:05.015 --> 00:13:08.210
as we will see is related
to its pressure-- in terms

00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:10.790
of the chemical potential.

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:13.950
Throughout the course we've seen
that the more interesting thing

00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:18.120
to look at is how things depend
on density rather than chemical

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:19.290
potential.

00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:25.180
So I'd better use this result
to get what the density is.

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:26.475
How do I do that?

00:13:26.475 --> 00:13:31.780
Well, once I have determined
what the chemical potential is,

00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:34.150
the average number
of particles will

00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:38.360
be the sum over and the
average occupation numbers

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:40.070
that I have in all
of these states.

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:47.630
And according to the
prescription that we have over

00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:51.980
here, in the limit of a
large box, this sum over k

00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:58.820
becomes gV intergral d
cubed k 2 pi Q. Ultimately

00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:01.540
I will divide by
V so I will have

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:04.050
the formula for the density.

00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:06.600
And what is Nk?

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:08.300
Well, I have the formula for Nk.

00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:13.590
It is 1 over z
inverse e to the beta.

00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:17.700
Epsilon k is h bar
squared k squared over 2m,

00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:19.480
and then I have a minus 8.

00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:22.960
OK?

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:31.390
So if I divide through by V,
really I will have the density.

00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:39.590
Get rid of this V. But I
have to do that integral.

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:46.070
Now for this and a
lot of other things,

00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:50.680
you can see that always I
will have sums or integrations

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:53.560
over the combination that
appears in the exponent

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:58.390
and enhances dimension list
which is beta epsilon of k.

00:14:58.390 --> 00:15:00.380
So let me introduce
a new variable.

00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:06.410
Let me call x to be the
combination beta h bar squared

00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:08.560
k squared over 2m.

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:12.420
So I'm going to call this
e to the x, if you like.

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:16.975
So I have changed
variables from k to x.

00:15:16.975 --> 00:15:24.540
k in terms of x is simply square
root of 2m inverse of beta--

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:30.130
which is kt-- divided
by h bar squared.

00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:32.910
But I took a square
root so it's just h bar.

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:38.190
Times x to the 1/2.

00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:40.900
OK?

00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:49.590
Now, I realize that h bar
is in fact h divided by 2pi.

00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:52.740
So the 2pi I can put
in the numerator.

00:15:55.930 --> 00:16:00.710
And then I remember that
actually the combination h

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:04.540
divided by square
root of 2pi mkt,

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:08.470
I was calling these
thermal wavelength lambda.

00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:12.570
And k should have the dimensions
of an inverse landscape,

00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:15.195
so that's the appropriate
thing to choose.

00:16:15.195 --> 00:16:17.220
So what do I get?

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:19.850
I take a square
root of pi inside

00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:25.000
and I'm left with 2 square root
of pi divided by this parameter

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.280
lambda x to the 1/2.

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:34.020
Again, for later
clarity, let's make

00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:40.650
sure we remember
this was our lambda.

00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:45.370
So this is the
variable k that I need.

00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:49.660
In fact, for the--
for the integration

00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:53.640
I have to also make
a change in dk.

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:58.830
So I not that dk, if I
take a derivative here,

00:16:58.830 --> 00:17:05.030
I will get x-- 1/2x to the minus
1/2 becomes root pi over lambda

00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:06.740
x to the minus 1/2 dx.

00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:15.700
Actually, the factor
that I need over here

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:20.710
is dk-- d cubed
k over 2pi cubed.

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:26.359
Now everything only depends
on the magnitude of k.

00:17:26.359 --> 00:17:30.260
So I will take advantage
of spherical symmetry,

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:39.950
write d cubed k as 4pi k
squared dk divided by 8pi cubed.

00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:43.700
And then I substitute
from k squared and dk

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:47.120
above in terms of this x.

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:52.610
So I will have a 1 over 2pi
squared from this division.

00:17:52.610 --> 00:18:00.600
k squared is simply 4pi
over lambda squared x.

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:02.870
This is k squared.

00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:10.860
dk is root pi over lambda
x to the minus 1/2 dx.

00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:16.990
So you can see lots
of things cancel out

00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:21.410
and the answer is going
to be x to the 1/2

00:18:21.410 --> 00:18:25.930
dx divided by lambda cubed.

00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:33.230
And what is left from all
of these pi's et cetera,

00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:38.130
is a factor of square
root of pi over 2.

00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:41.160
Or 2 in the numerator or
a square root of pi over 2

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:43.940
in the denominator.

00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:46.160
OK?

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:50.305
So if I do these set
of changes that I

00:18:50.305 --> 00:18:52.460
have on the right
part of the board,

00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:54.330
what do I have for density?

00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:58.470
The density becomes simply g.

00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:02.500
I have this integral
over k that I

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:11.930
have recast as an integral
that is x to the 1/2 dx.

00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:16.950
Let me pull out the factor of
lambda cubed on the outside.

00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:20.340
So I have g over lambda cubed.

00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:25.450
I will pull out to that
factor of root pi over 2

00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:27.500
that I had before.

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:29.670
And then I have
the integral from 0

00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:32.910
to infinity dx x to the 1/2.

00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:36.820
Actually, let me write
it in this fashion.

00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:39.840
dx x to the 1/2.

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:43.500
And in the denominator,
what do I have?

00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:48.390
I have z universe
into the x minus 8.

00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:59.750
So we did all of these and
we ended up with an integral

00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:02.430
that we don't recognize.

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:06.600
So what we are going to do is
to pretend that we recognize it

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:08.450
and give it a name.

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:09.240
All right?

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:23.210
So we define a set of functions
f sub m of variable z.

00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:29.320
Once I do the integration over
x, I will get a function of z.

00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:34.120
So that function of z
I will call fm of z.

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:39.060
But clearly I have a different
fm if I have eta minus 1 or eta

00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:41.930
plus 1 for bosons of fermions.

00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:44.080
So there is two
classes of things.

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:46.030
What's this m?

00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:47.180
OK.

00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:51.460
So here I had the
integral x to the 1/2.

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:55.120
It turns out that you will get
a whole bunch of these integrals

00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:57.980
where the [INAUDIBLE] that
is out front in the numerator

00:20:57.980 --> 00:20:59.700
is different.

00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:04.680
So I will generalize this x to
the 1/2, this 1/2 to something

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:07.400
that I'll call it m minus 1.

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:13.440
And then I have z inverse
e to the x minus eta.

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:17.470
And if these normalized
so that what is in front

00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:19.855
is 1 over m minus 1 factorial.

00:21:26.604 --> 00:21:27.600
OK?

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:30.350
So these are very
important functions.

00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:32.250
Everything we will
do later on we

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:34.390
will be expressing in
terms of these functions.

00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:42.060
Now, clearly what is happening
here corresponds to m minus 1

00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:48.580
being equal to 1/2
or m being 3/2.

00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:51.426
What is this normalization?

00:21:51.426 --> 00:21:56.230
Well, for the normalization,
if this is 1/2

00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:59.450
I would need 1/2 factorial.

00:21:59.450 --> 00:22:03.070
And if you go and look at
the various definitions

00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:07.430
that we have for the gamma
function or the factorial,

00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:11.580
you can check that 1/2
factorial is root pi over 2.

00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:14.560
And, indeed, we saw
this already when

00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:17.910
we wrote the expression
for the surface area

00:22:17.910 --> 00:22:21.246
in general dimensions
that involved

00:22:21.246 --> 00:22:24.470
factorial function
appearing as fractions.

00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:27.000
And in order to get the
right result in two or three

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.330
dimensions, you can
check that this root

00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:33.830
pi over 2 for 1/2
factorial is correct.

00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:38.670
So, indeed, I already have
this root pi over 2 over here.

00:22:38.670 --> 00:22:40.840
It was properly normalized.

00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:43.490
So the whole thing
here can be written

00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:51.270
as n is g over lambda
cubed f 3/2 eta of z.

00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:53.560
That is the expression
that relates

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:58.720
the density to the chemical
potential or this communication

00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:03.350
e to the beta mu, which
is z or the fugacity

00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:05.930
is simply this nice formula.

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:10.740
OK?

00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:22.540
But what we want is
to calculate something

00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:25.020
like the pressure for the gas.

00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:29.880
Well, let me remind you that
log Q, essentially, quite

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:35.430
generally, log Q comes
from normalizing something

00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:41.580
that is like mu times the
total number of particles

00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:45.100
minus the energy-- you can
kind of read that from here--

00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:50.820
and then there would be TS
from the number of states.

00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:53.810
This was the general
formula that we had.

00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:59.660
And when we substitute for
a system that is extensive,

00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:08.410
where E for a gas is
mu n plus TS minus PV,

00:24:08.410 --> 00:24:11.980
we see that the log of
the partition function

00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:14.250
is simply the
combination beta PV.

00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:20.785
Of course, again, this
pressure as a function

00:24:20.785 --> 00:24:23.860
of density or chemical
potential would be different

00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:26.070
whether we are thinking
about bosons of fermions.

00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:32.440
But it can be calculated
from the kind of sum

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:34.920
that we have over here.

00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:37.060
So let's do that.

00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:42.150
So I have beta P
which is something

00:24:42.150 --> 00:24:47.290
like log Q divided
by V. Is obtained

00:24:47.290 --> 00:24:52.620
by doing this sum over k
over V. And so what do I get?

00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:56.780
I will get-- first of all,
I have the minus eta sum

00:24:56.780 --> 00:25:01.130
over k [INAUDIBLE]
with g integral

00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:06.900
over k divided by 2pi cubed.

00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:11.310
The volume factor cancels
because I divided by volume.

00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:20.020
I have log of 1 minus eta z
e to the minus beta-- again,

00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:23.820
h bar squared k
squared over 2m--

00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:27.950
are the energy that
I'm dealing with.

00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:28.621
OK?

00:25:28.621 --> 00:25:29.120
Fine.

00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:32.276
What do we do with this?

00:25:32.276 --> 00:25:35.310
We make the same
change of variables

00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:39.450
that we have over
here from k to x.

00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:47.040
So then I would have minus
eta d cubed k over 2pi cubed

00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:53.590
gets replaced with this 2
over root pi lambda cubed.

00:25:56.750 --> 00:26:02.272
And then I have the
integral 0 to infinity dx

00:26:02.272 --> 00:26:11.827
x to the 1/2 log of 1 minus
eta z e to the minus x.

00:26:16.210 --> 00:26:18.160
Huh.

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:20.314
It seems like-- yes?

00:26:20.314 --> 00:26:22.409
AUDIENCE: What happened
to your factor g?

00:26:22.409 --> 00:26:22.950
PROFESSOR: G?

00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:23.810
Good question.

00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:27.590
Anything else?

00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:35.590
So I was hoping
to have integrals

00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:39.270
that are all expressible in
terms of this-- these set

00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:42.620
of functions that I defined.

00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:45.530
This log does not fall
into this category.

00:26:45.530 --> 00:26:48.050
Should I define something else?

00:26:48.050 --> 00:26:50.010
Well, the answer
is no because I can

00:26:50.010 --> 00:26:53.300
make that integral
look like this

00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:57.590
by simbly doing an
integration by parts.

00:26:57.590 --> 00:27:09.810
So we do integrate by parts
in which case what I do

00:27:09.810 --> 00:27:14.890
is I take a derivative
of this and I

00:27:14.890 --> 00:27:18.350
take an integral
of x to the 1/2.

00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:23.910
Integral of x to the 1/2
becomes x to the 3/2 over 3/2.

00:27:23.910 --> 00:27:27.351
There is, of course,
a minus sign involved.

00:27:27.351 --> 00:27:32.132
So this minus becomes plus eta.

00:27:32.132 --> 00:27:35.210
Make sure I have
the g this time.

00:27:35.210 --> 00:27:41.010
2 over root pi lambda cubed.

00:27:41.010 --> 00:27:46.810
I have the integral
from 0 to infinity dx.

00:27:46.810 --> 00:27:50.540
x to the 1/2 became
x to the 3/2.

00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:52.990
The 3/2 I will bring out front.

00:27:52.990 --> 00:27:55.300
So I have 1 over 3/2 here.

00:27:58.030 --> 00:28:01.480
And then I have to take the
derivative of this function.

00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:04.180
What's the derivative
of the log?

00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:10.810
It is 1 over the argument of
the log times the derivative

00:28:10.810 --> 00:28:14.820
of the argument of
the log which is minus

00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:17.770
eta z, the derivative
of e to the minus x,

00:28:17.770 --> 00:28:19.320
which is e to the minus x.

00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:21.720
And this minus becomes plus.

00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:26.670
OK?

00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:30.540
So let's arrange
things a little bit.

00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:37.350
I can get rid of these etas
because eta squared will be 1.

00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:38.850
What is the answer, therefore?

00:28:38.850 --> 00:28:44.900
It is g over lambda cubed.

00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:47.420
That's fine.

00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:52.270
If root pi over 2
is 1/2 factorial,

00:28:52.270 --> 00:28:57.000
and I multiply 1/2 factorial
with 3/2, what I will get

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.670
is 1 over 3/2 factorial.

00:29:00.670 --> 00:29:06.040
Because n factorial is n
times n minus 1 factorial.

00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:07.700
And then, what do I have?

00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:10.546
I have 0 to infinity dx.

00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:20.710
x to the 3/2, divide the
numerator and denominator by z

00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:28.060
e to the minus x and you get z
inverse e to the x minus eta.

00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:32.670
And lo and behold, we have
a function of the variety

00:29:32.670 --> 00:29:37.310
that we had defined on the
board corresponding to n minus 1

00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:41.180
being 3/2 or n being 5/2.

00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:46.790
So what we have here is
that beta P, depending

00:29:46.790 --> 00:29:49.500
on whatever statistics
we are dealing with,

00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:57.432
is g over lambda
cubed f 5/2 eta of z.

00:30:04.390 --> 00:30:05.258
Yes?

00:30:05.258 --> 00:30:08.130
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:08.130 --> 00:30:09.090
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:30:09.090 --> 00:30:11.510
So what you have to
do is always ensure

00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:14.080
what is happening to
the boundary terms.

00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:16.630
Boundary terms will
be a product of x

00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:21.290
to the 3/2 and this factor.

00:30:21.290 --> 00:30:27.270
At x equals to 0, x to the 3/s
will ensure that you are 0.

00:30:27.270 --> 00:30:29.960
At x goes to infinity,
the exponential

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:32.640
will ensure that you're to 0.

00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:34.830
So the boundary
terms are important

00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:36.880
and indeed you
have to check them.

00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:39.440
And you can check
that they are 0.

00:30:43.390 --> 00:30:44.616
OK?

00:30:44.616 --> 00:30:48.350
AUDIENCE: I think the factor
that multiples x to the 3/2

00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:50.590
is [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:52.222
But it's-- the
argument still holds.

00:30:52.222 --> 00:30:53.680
PROFESSOR: The
argument still holds

00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:58.370
because as x goes to infinity,
e to the minus x goes to 0.

00:30:58.370 --> 00:31:00.320
Log of 1 is 0.

00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:02.600
In fact, you can ask,
how does it go to 0?

00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:04.690
It goes to 0 exponentially.

00:31:04.690 --> 00:31:08.300
Exponentially it
will [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:08.800
Yes.

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:10.008
Thank you for the correction.

00:31:18.330 --> 00:31:18.830
OK?

00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:22.130
All right.

00:31:22.130 --> 00:31:26.720
There's one other thing
that we can take a look at.

00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:28.770
The total energy.

00:31:28.770 --> 00:31:29.830
OK.

00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:33.240
So the energy in each
one of these states

00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:35.680
is given by that formula.

00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:39.640
So if I ask, what is the total
expectation value of energy?

00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:43.980
And again, in
thermodynamics we expect

00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:48.040
the extensive quantities such
as the energy should have,

00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:50.650
in an aerodynamic sense,
well defined values

00:31:50.650 --> 00:31:53.440
so I won't write the
expectation value.

00:31:53.440 --> 00:32:03.020
Is going to be a sum
over k Nk epsilon k.

00:32:03.020 --> 00:32:07.320
And this will depend on the
statistics that I'm looking at.

00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:11.670
And what I will have is
that this will go over

00:32:11.670 --> 00:32:21.220
to an integral over k divided
by 2pi cubed multiplied g

00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:28.160
and multiplied by
V. I have epsilon

00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:33.730
of k which is h bar
squared k squared over 2m.

00:32:33.730 --> 00:32:36.840
The expectation
value of N, which

00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:43.900
is z inverse e to the minus
beta-- sorry-- z inverse

00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:49.556
e to the plus beta h bar squared
k squared over 2m minus 8.

00:32:56.230 --> 00:32:56.730
OK?

00:32:59.550 --> 00:33:08.090
So the simplest way to do this
is to first of all divide by V.

00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:11.960
So I can define
an energy density.

00:33:15.770 --> 00:33:20.030
Actually, since I'm
going to change variables

00:33:20.030 --> 00:33:23.740
to this combination
that is x, I notice

00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:27.690
that up to a factor of
betas the numerator is x.

00:33:27.690 --> 00:33:33.070
So let me actually calculate
the combination beta e over V.

00:33:33.070 --> 00:33:37.080
That only depends on
this combination x.

00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:38.200
So what is it?

00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:43.360
It is g-- the integral
over k, I know

00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:46.090
how to replace it
with something that

00:33:46.090 --> 00:33:54.295
involves x-- is going to give
me 2 over root pi lambda cubed.

00:33:54.295 --> 00:33:59.970
Integral 0 to infinity dx.

00:33:59.970 --> 00:34:04.440
From the change of variables,
I have x to the 1/2.

00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:07.300
But I introduced
one factor of x here

00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:12.590
because I have this energy
factor in the numerator.

00:34:12.590 --> 00:34:16.010
So that changes this
to x to the 3/2.

00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:19.214
And then again, I have z
inverse e to the x minus 8.

00:34:22.179 --> 00:34:22.679
OK?

00:34:25.659 --> 00:34:29.230
So if is one of the integrals
that we have defined.

00:34:29.230 --> 00:34:34.989
In fact, it is exactly what I
have above for the pressure,

00:34:34.989 --> 00:34:39.630
except that I don't have the
factor of 3/2 that appeared

00:34:39.630 --> 00:34:44.850
nicely to give the
right normalization.

00:34:44.850 --> 00:34:51.920
So what I conclude is
that this quantity is

00:34:51.920 --> 00:35:09.199
in fact g over lambda cubed
times 3/2 of f 5/2 eta of z.

00:35:12.691 --> 00:35:13.191
OK?

00:35:18.190 --> 00:35:21.060
But they are exactly
the same functions

00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:22.595
for energy and pressure.

00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:30.480
So you can see
that, irrespective

00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:33.740
of what the chemical
potential is doing,

00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:40.110
I can state that for the quantum
system e is always 3/2 PV.

00:35:42.970 --> 00:35:49.110
Of course, we have seen
this expression classically.

00:35:49.110 --> 00:35:50.950
Now what happens
quantum mechanically

00:35:50.950 --> 00:35:52.930
is that the pressure
starts to vary

00:35:52.930 --> 00:35:55.440
in some complicated
way with density.

00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:58.720
But what we learn is
that energy will also

00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:02.810
vary in the same complicated
way with density,

00:36:02.810 --> 00:36:10.310
such that always this
formula EV 3/2 PV is valid.

00:36:10.310 --> 00:36:12.900
There is some nice
symmetry reason

00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:16.025
for why that is the
case that you explore

00:36:16.025 --> 00:36:17.930
in one of the problems
that you will see.

00:36:22.311 --> 00:36:22.810
OK?

00:36:25.830 --> 00:36:31.850
So these are the
characteristics.

00:36:31.850 --> 00:36:34.790
In some sense we have
solved the problem

00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:39.670
because we know both density
and pressure in terms

00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:41.840
of chemical potential.

00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:44.770
So all we need to do
is to invert this, get

00:36:44.770 --> 00:36:47.750
the chemical potential
as a function of density,

00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:49.780
insert it in the
formula for pressure

00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:52.420
and we have pressure as
a function of density.

00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:55.610
But since these are
kind of implicit

00:36:55.610 --> 00:37:00.190
through these f
functions, we don't quite

00:37:00.190 --> 00:37:02.480
know what that means.

00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:05.900
So the next stage
is to really study

00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:10.270
how these f functions
behave and how

00:37:10.270 --> 00:37:15.920
we can relate their behaviors
to dependence on density.

00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:20.110
And we will see that we have to
distinguish between low density

00:37:20.110 --> 00:37:23.090
and high density regimes.

00:37:23.090 --> 00:37:25.230
What does it mean?

00:37:25.230 --> 00:37:27.780
Well, you can see that both
have players on the right hand

00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:30.650
side is dimensionless.

00:37:30.650 --> 00:37:33.390
The only dimension
full combination

00:37:33.390 --> 00:37:36.970
that we have here is
N-- well, we can make it

00:37:36.970 --> 00:37:41.850
dimensionless by multiplying
by lambda cubed over g.

00:37:41.850 --> 00:37:46.180
So it turns out
that whether or not

00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:48.930
you see things that are
classical or things that

00:37:48.930 --> 00:37:51.510
are very quantum
mechanical depend

00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:53.270
on this degeneracy factor.

00:37:56.070 --> 00:38:00.780
Which, within our context of
statistical physics of gases,

00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:03.400
we define to be
the communication N

00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:04.810
lambda cubed over g.

00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:11.890
And we will regain
classical behaviors

00:38:11.890 --> 00:38:15.040
when degeneracy
is small, density

00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:18.680
is small enough such that
d is much less than 1.

00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:21.320
We will see totally
new behavior that

00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:24.990
is appropriate to quantum
mechanics in other limit

00:38:24.990 --> 00:38:27.852
where [? d ?] becomes large.

00:38:27.852 --> 00:38:29.710
OK?

00:38:29.710 --> 00:38:42.770
So this distinguishes classical
versus quantum behavior.

00:38:48.540 --> 00:38:53.700
Now, we expect to regain
classical behavior

00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:56.360
in the limit of
very low densities.

00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:58.460
That's what we've
been kind of saying

00:38:58.460 --> 00:39:02.050
from the very first lecture
that low density gas has

00:39:02.050 --> 00:39:06.440
this ideal behavior
where PV is Nkt.

00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:09.980
And, therefore, let's
focus on the limit

00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:14.950
where V is much less than
1, which is classical.

00:39:18.290 --> 00:39:31.530
And since d is f
3/2 eta of z, we

00:39:31.530 --> 00:39:37.420
need the behavior of the
function when it is small--

00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:39.830
and I'll show you
[INAUDIBLE] consistently

00:39:39.830 --> 00:39:45.030
that the function is small
when it's argument is small.

00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:49.420
So we'll see that d
less than 1 implies

00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:53.035
or is implied by z
being less than 1.

00:39:55.770 --> 00:39:57.400
OK?

00:39:57.400 --> 00:40:00.275
So let's take a look at
one of these functions,

00:40:00.275 --> 00:40:07.400
fm eta z, 1 over m
minus 1 factorial, 0

00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:11.980
to infinity dx, x
to the m minus 1,

00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:15.110
z universe e to the x minus 1.

00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:24.730
And I'd like to explore the
limit of this when z is small.

00:40:24.730 --> 00:40:28.140
So that's currently not very
good because I have z inverse.

00:40:28.140 --> 00:40:32.300
So what I will do is I will
multiply by z e to the minus

00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:35.790
x both numerator
and denominator.

00:40:35.790 --> 00:40:41.480
So I will have m minus
1 factorial integral 0

00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:46.550
to infinity dx x
to the n minus 1.

00:40:46.550 --> 00:40:50.300
I have z e to the minus x.

00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:54.560
I have-- oops, there
was an eta here.

00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:59.981
1 minus eta z e to the minus x.

00:40:59.981 --> 00:41:00.480
OK?

00:41:02.990 --> 00:41:05.850
Then I say, well, the
thing that is appearing

00:41:05.850 --> 00:41:10.350
in the denominator,
I can write as a sum

00:41:10.350 --> 00:41:12.990
of a geometric series
in powers of z.

00:41:12.990 --> 00:41:15.750
And that's, after all,
what I'm attempting to do,

00:41:15.750 --> 00:41:18.390
make an expansion
in powers of z.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:26.620
It starts with z to the minus x.

00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:31.180
And 1 over 1 minus
eta z to the minus

00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:38.300
x I can write as the sum alpha
going from 0 to infinity of eta

00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:41.980
z e to the minus x raised
to the power of [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:41.980 --> 00:41:46.390
This geometric series sums
to what I have over there.

00:41:46.390 --> 00:41:48.510
OK?

00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:51.830
Let's rearrange
this a little bit.

00:41:51.830 --> 00:41:57.090
I will take the sum
over alpha outside.

00:41:57.090 --> 00:42:02.320
Well, I notice that actually
I have here, this first term,

00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:04.810
which is different from
this by a factor of eta.

00:42:04.810 --> 00:42:10.280
So let me multiply by an
eta and get another eta.

00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:13.600
And then I have a sum
that starts from 1

00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:23.280
to infinity of eta z e to the
minus x to the power of alpha.

00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:27.400
So I have eta z to
the power of alpha.

00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:29.410
I have one other eta here.

00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:42.080
And then I have the integration
over x, x to the m minus 1.

00:42:46.140 --> 00:42:48.690
I didn't write e to the
minus x to the alpha

00:42:48.690 --> 00:42:51.480
because I pulled it
out the integration.

00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:54.514
I will write it now. e
to the minus alpha x.

00:42:57.720 --> 00:43:01.438
And I didn't write 1
over n minus 1 factor.

00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:14.080
Now, once more, this is an
integration that you have seen.

00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:17.240
The result of doing
integral dx x to the m

00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:21.440
minus 1 e to the minus x is
simply m minus 1 factorial.

00:43:26.010 --> 00:43:28.270
Except that it is
not e to the minus

00:43:28.270 --> 00:43:31.160
x but it's e to
the minus alpha x.

00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:34.280
I can rescale
everything by alpha

00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:38.078
and I will pull out a
factor of alpha to there.

00:43:38.078 --> 00:43:39.560
OK?

00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:41.700
So what do we have?

00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:48.100
We have that fm eta of z
as a [? power series ?]

00:43:48.100 --> 00:43:55.340
representation, alpha
running from 1 to infinity,

00:43:55.340 --> 00:44:00.040
z to the alpha divided
by alpha to the m.

00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:04.690
It's an alternating series
that starts with plus

00:44:04.690 --> 00:44:07.760
and then becomes a
minus, et cetera.

00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:10.440
So if I were to
explicitly write this,

00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:12.350
you will see how nice it is.

00:44:12.350 --> 00:44:19.860
It is z plus eta z squared
2 to the m plus z cubed 3

00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:24.800
to the m plus eta z
to the 4 4 to the m.

00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:28.820
And you can see why it is such a
nice thing that really deserves

00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:30.800
to have a function
named after it.

00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:34.080
So we call that nice
series [? to  Vf. ?]

00:44:41.930 --> 00:44:46.250
Now, for future reference,
note the following.

00:44:46.250 --> 00:44:51.340
If I take a derivative of
this function with respect

00:44:51.340 --> 00:44:56.290
to z-- its argument-- then
in this power series, say,

00:44:56.290 --> 00:45:00.020
z to the 4 becomes 4z cubed.

00:45:00.020 --> 00:45:02.880
4 will cancel one of
the 4's that I have here

00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:05.290
and it becomes 4
to the m minus 1.

00:45:05.290 --> 00:45:07.840
This becomes 3 to the m minus 1.

00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:10.070
So you can see that
the coefficients that

00:45:10.070 --> 00:45:15.230
were powers of m become
powers of m minus 1.

00:45:15.230 --> 00:45:18.290
Numerator has gone
down by one factor.

00:45:18.290 --> 00:45:21.160
So let's multiply by z.

00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:23.880
So the numerator is
now what it was before.

00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:27.020
The denominators, rather than
being raised to the power of m,

00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:29.520
are raised to the
power of m minus 1.

00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:36.030
So clearly, this is the
same thing as fm minus 1.

00:45:36.030 --> 00:45:41.110
So basically these functions
have this nice character

00:45:41.110 --> 00:45:42.400
that they are like a ladder.

00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:44.860
You take a derivative
of one and you

00:45:44.860 --> 00:45:48.623
get the one that is
indexed by one less.

00:45:53.053 --> 00:45:53.553
OK?

00:46:03.413 --> 00:46:06.371
AUDIENCE: Is there a factor
of eta that comes out to be

00:46:06.371 --> 00:46:09.225
[INAUDIBLE].

00:46:09.225 --> 00:46:10.475
PROFESSOR: In the derivatives?

00:46:10.475 --> 00:46:15.692
AUDIENCE: I mean, it seems to
me that there's an eta-- like,

00:46:15.692 --> 00:46:16.650
in that relation that--

00:46:16.650 --> 00:46:17.816
PROFESSOR: In this relation?

00:46:17.816 --> 00:46:18.560
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:19.143
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:46:19.143 --> 00:46:21.620
So let's do it by step.

00:46:21.620 --> 00:46:28.420
If I take a
derivative, divide dz,

00:46:28.420 --> 00:46:35.700
I get 1 plus eta z squared
z 2 to the m minus 1 plus

00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:40.460
z squared' 3 to the m minus 1.

00:46:40.460 --> 00:46:44.845
Then I multiply by
z, this becomes z,

00:46:44.845 --> 00:46:47.500
this becomes z squared,
this becomes z cubed.

00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:49.210
And you can see
that the etas are

00:46:49.210 --> 00:46:52.969
exactly where they should be.

00:46:52.969 --> 00:47:03.749
AUDIENCE: Would you explain
why the index of summation

00:47:03.749 --> 00:47:04.868
starts from--

00:47:04.868 --> 00:47:05.493
PROFESSOR: One?

00:47:05.493 --> 00:47:06.200
AUDIENCE: --one.

00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:06.930
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:47:06.930 --> 00:47:11.220
So let's take a look
at this function.

00:47:11.220 --> 00:47:15.060
You can see there is a z
inverse in the denominator.

00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:19.290
So I made it into a z here.

00:47:19.290 --> 00:47:26.640
So you can see that if z is very
small, if will start with z.

00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:27.140
All right?

00:47:27.140 --> 00:47:28.740
Now what happened here?

00:47:28.740 --> 00:47:32.090
I wrote this as a sum
of geometric series.

00:47:32.090 --> 00:47:37.050
I pulled out this factor of
z that was in the numerator,

00:47:37.050 --> 00:47:42.480
and the denominator I wrote as
a series that starts with 0.

00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:45.190
But then there is
this z out front.

00:47:45.190 --> 00:47:49.790
I pulled this z e to the
minus x in front here

00:47:49.790 --> 00:47:52.600
and then it starts with 1.

00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:55.030
I could have written it--
I can put this in here

00:47:55.030 --> 00:47:57.740
and write it as alpha
plus 1 with alpha

00:47:57.740 --> 00:47:59.235
starting from 0, et cetera.

00:47:59.235 --> 00:48:00.640
Or I can write it [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:04.360
Or, alternatively, you can
say, let's put the eta here

00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:05.770
and eta here.

00:48:05.770 --> 00:48:08.540
And then I see that this is
the geometric series where

00:48:08.540 --> 00:48:12.309
the first term is this z
to the minus x [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:19.294 --> 00:48:19.794
OK?

00:48:25.300 --> 00:48:31.230
So I want to erase this
board but keep this formula.

00:48:31.230 --> 00:48:33.826
So let me erase it
and then rewrite it.

00:48:46.410 --> 00:48:52.991
So this I will rewrite as
N lambda q over g, which

00:48:52.991 --> 00:48:59.170
is my degeneracy factor,
is f 3/2 eta of z.

00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:09.260
And in the limit
where z goes to small,

00:49:09.260 --> 00:49:13.950
I can use the expansion
that I just derived,

00:49:13.950 --> 00:49:20.840
which is z plus eta z squared
2 to the-- what is it--

00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:25.620
3/2 plus z cubed.

00:49:25.620 --> 00:49:30.870
3 to the 3/2 and so forth.

00:49:30.870 --> 00:49:35.130
You can see that precisely
because as z goes to 0,

00:49:35.130 --> 00:49:38.860
this series goes to
0, that smallness of z

00:49:38.860 --> 00:49:41.994
is the same thing or implied
by the smallness of z.

00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:50.140
But that z is equal to d
only at the lowest order.

00:49:50.140 --> 00:49:52.010
So what happens
at higher orders,

00:49:52.010 --> 00:49:58.990
z-- inverting this-- is d minus
eta z squared 2 to the 3/2 plus

00:49:58.990 --> 00:50:05.390
z cubed 3 to the
3/2, and so forth.

00:50:05.390 --> 00:50:10.370
And we saw this when I
was doing the calculation

00:50:10.370 --> 00:50:14.660
for the interacting gas, that
clearly to lowest order z

00:50:14.660 --> 00:50:19.200
equals to d, if I want
to get the next order,

00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:22.150
I substitute the result
of the previous order

00:50:22.150 --> 00:50:23.770
into this expression.

00:50:23.770 --> 00:50:27.680
So z I substitute
for d, I will d

00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:35.150
minus eta d squared 2 to the
3/2 as the first contribution.

00:50:35.150 --> 00:50:37.470
And then something that
is order of d cubed.

00:50:40.340 --> 00:50:44.120
And if I want the answer
to the d cubed order,

00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:47.310
I take this whole thing that
is that order of d squared

00:50:47.310 --> 00:50:49.830
and substitute in this series.

00:50:49.830 --> 00:50:51.310
And so what do I get?

00:50:51.310 --> 00:50:59.620
I will get d minus
eta 2 to the 3/2,

00:50:59.620 --> 00:51:03.560
square of z-- which is the
square of this quantity--

00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:08.690
square of this quantity
is d squared minus twice

00:51:08.690 --> 00:51:10.960
the product of these two terms.

00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:17.030
So I have twice eta
d cubed 2 to the 3/2.

00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:21.310
And then square of this term,
but that's order of e to the 4.

00:51:21.310 --> 00:51:23.180
I don't care for that.

00:51:23.180 --> 00:51:32.410
And then I have, from here,
plus d cubed 3 to the 3/2

00:51:32.410 --> 00:51:34.880
ignoring terms of the
order of d to the 4th.

00:51:37.700 --> 00:51:39.590
OK?

00:51:39.590 --> 00:51:43.320
So z is--

00:51:43.320 --> 00:51:48.677
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] z equals
d minus and the d [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:48.677 --> 00:51:49.552
PROFESSOR: Ah, great.

00:51:49.552 --> 00:51:50.070
Thank you.

00:51:50.070 --> 00:51:50.570
Minus.

00:51:53.650 --> 00:51:54.501
Minus.

00:51:54.501 --> 00:51:55.001
Good.

00:51:58.370 --> 00:52:04.195
Saves me having to go back later
when the answer doesn't match.

00:52:04.195 --> 00:52:04.695
OK.

00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:09.076
Fine.

00:52:09.076 --> 00:52:11.720
Now let's organize terms.

00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:14.050
The lowest order I have d.

00:52:14.050 --> 00:52:17.280
At order of d
squared I have still

00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:25.470
just this one term, minus eta
d squared over 2 to the 3/2.

00:52:25.470 --> 00:52:29.050
We knew that was the correct
result at order of d squared.

00:52:29.050 --> 00:52:32.330
At order of d cubed
I have two terms.

00:52:32.330 --> 00:52:35.240
One is the product
of these two terms.

00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:39.500
The etas disappear,
minus 2, and this

00:52:39.500 --> 00:52:42.870
will give me 2 over
9 which is 1/4.

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:53.180
And from other part, I have
1 over 3 to the 3/1 d cubed.

00:52:53.180 --> 00:52:57.210
And I haven't calculate things
at order of d to the 4th.

00:53:01.410 --> 00:53:03.370
OK?

00:53:03.370 --> 00:53:04.600
Fine.

00:53:04.600 --> 00:53:08.120
So we have calculated
in a power series

00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:11.990
that we can go to
whatever order you like.

00:53:11.990 --> 00:53:14.790
This is z which is related
to chemical potential

00:53:14.790 --> 00:53:16.990
as a function of
this degeneracy that

00:53:16.990 --> 00:53:19.810
is simply related to density.

00:53:19.810 --> 00:53:23.760
Now, the formula for the
pressure is up there.

00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:36.150
It is that eta P is g over
lambda cubed f 5/2 eta of z.

00:53:39.130 --> 00:53:40.310
Right?

00:53:40.310 --> 00:53:43.940
So reorganizing
this a little bit,

00:53:43.940 --> 00:53:47.470
the dimensionless
form is beta P lambda

00:53:47.470 --> 00:53:52.812
cubed over g f 5/2 eta of z.

00:53:52.812 --> 00:53:56.440
f 5/2 we can make an expansion.

00:53:56.440 --> 00:54:04.610
It is z plus eta z squared
2 to the 5/2 plus z cubed 3

00:54:04.610 --> 00:54:09.130
to the 5/2 and so forth.

00:54:09.130 --> 00:54:13.500
For z I substitute
from the line above.

00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:25.710
So I have d minus eta d squared
2 to the 3/2 plus 1/4 minus 1

00:54:25.710 --> 00:54:30.500
over 3 to the 3/2 d cubed.

00:54:30.500 --> 00:54:32.630
So that's the first term.

00:54:32.630 --> 00:54:40.250
The next term is eta 2
to the 5/2 z squared.

00:54:40.250 --> 00:54:44.610
So I have to square what is
up here and here keeping terms

00:54:44.610 --> 00:54:47.450
to order of d cubed.

00:54:47.450 --> 00:54:48.460
So what do I have?

00:54:48.460 --> 00:54:56.630
I have d squared from
squaring this term.

00:54:56.630 --> 00:54:59.590
And a term that is twice the
product of these two terms.

00:54:59.590 --> 00:55:02.420
That's the only term
that is order of d cubed.

00:55:02.420 --> 00:55:09.650
So I have minus 2 eta
2 to the 3/2 d cubed.

00:55:13.220 --> 00:55:16.120
And finally, z cubed
over 3 to the 5/2

00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:21.590
would be d cubed
over 3 to the 5/2.

00:55:21.590 --> 00:55:23.020
And I haven't
calculated anything

00:55:23.020 --> 00:55:24.940
at all of d to the 4th.

00:55:28.300 --> 00:55:29.910
OK?

00:55:29.910 --> 00:55:30.715
So what do I have?

00:55:30.715 --> 00:55:34.675
I have that beta P
lambda cubed over g.

00:55:37.240 --> 00:55:40.360
Well, you can see
that everything

00:55:40.360 --> 00:55:44.590
is going to be proportional
to d d squared d cubed.

00:55:44.590 --> 00:55:49.280
So let's put out the factor of d
which is m lambda cubed over g.

00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:55.510
So this is just one factor
of d that I have pulled out.

00:55:55.510 --> 00:56:03.780
So that then I start with 1,
and then the next correction

00:56:03.780 --> 00:56:09.730
I have an eta d squared
2 to the 3/2 here,

00:56:09.730 --> 00:56:15.770
eta d squared 2 to the 5/2
here with opposite sign.

00:56:15.770 --> 00:56:19.080
So this is twice
bigger than that.

00:56:19.080 --> 00:56:24.350
So the sum total of them would
be minus eta divided by 2

00:56:24.350 --> 00:56:29.090
to the 5/2 times d
squared-- one factor

00:56:29.090 --> 00:56:33.820
of d I have out front-- the
other factor I will write here

00:56:33.820 --> 00:56:35.158
and lambda cubed over g.

00:56:38.370 --> 00:56:44.820
And then at order of d cubed,
I have a bunch of terms.

00:56:44.820 --> 00:56:53.360
I have a 1/4 here, and from
the product of these terms,

00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:59.740
I will have etas disappear,
I have 2 divided by 2

00:56:59.740 --> 00:57:03.900
to the 8/2 which is 2
to the 4th which is 16.

00:57:03.900 --> 00:57:08.830
So the product of these things
will give me a minus 1/8.

00:57:08.830 --> 00:57:13.130
I have 1/4 minus
1/8 I will get 1/8.

00:57:16.300 --> 00:57:18.605
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:57:18.605 --> 00:57:19.530
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:57:19.530 --> 00:57:26.150
And then we have minus
3-- 1 over 3 to the 1/2

00:57:26.150 --> 00:57:29.050
and this 3 to the 5/2.

00:57:29.050 --> 00:57:31.200
This is three times
larger than this.

00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:34.050
This is 3 over 3 to the 5/2.

00:57:34.050 --> 00:57:36.350
Subtract one of
them, I will be left

00:57:36.350 --> 00:57:41.836
minus 2 divided by
3 to the 5/2 [? N ?]

00:57:41.836 --> 00:57:45.440
lambda cubed over g squared.

00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:46.210
And so forth.

00:57:49.010 --> 00:57:54.310
So you can see that the
form that we have is beta

00:57:54.310 --> 00:57:58.540
P-- the pressure--
starts with density.

00:57:58.540 --> 00:58:02.440
I essentially divide it
through by lambda q over g.

00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:07.640
I start with the
ideal gas result, n,

00:58:07.640 --> 00:58:11.960
and then I have a correction
that is order of n squared.

00:58:11.960 --> 00:58:17.200
I can write it as B2 n squared.

00:58:17.200 --> 00:58:20.020
In view up our
[INAUDIBLE] co-efficients.

00:58:20.020 --> 00:58:29.380
And we see that our B2 is
minus eta times-- sorry.

00:58:29.380 --> 00:58:41.360
Minus eta 2 to the 5/2
times n lambda cubed over g.

00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:47.190
Remember that B2s, et cetera,
had dimensions of volume.

00:58:47.190 --> 00:58:51.190
So if the volume is
provided by lambda cubed,

00:58:51.190 --> 00:58:55.490
it is an additional factor.

00:58:55.490 --> 00:58:59.060
For fermions it's a
positive pressure.

00:58:59.060 --> 00:59:02.340
So the pressure goes up because
fermions repel each other.

00:59:02.340 --> 00:59:04.440
For bosons it is negative.

00:59:04.440 --> 00:59:06.940
Bosons attract each other.

00:59:06.940 --> 00:59:09.770
And we have actually
calculated this.

00:59:09.770 --> 00:59:13.260
We did a calculation
of the canonical form

00:59:13.260 --> 00:59:16.490
where we had the one
exchange corrections.

00:59:16.490 --> 00:59:19.280
And if you go back to the
notes or if you remember,

00:59:19.280 --> 00:59:22.500
we had calculated
precisely this.

00:59:22.500 --> 00:59:25.380
But then I said that
if I went and tried

00:59:25.380 --> 00:59:28.370
to calculate the
next correction using

00:59:28.370 --> 00:59:30.570
the canonical
formulation, I would

00:59:30.570 --> 00:59:32.900
have to keep track
of diagrams that

00:59:32.900 --> 00:59:36.450
involve three exchanges
and all kinds of things

00:59:36.450 --> 00:59:38.080
and it was complicated.

00:59:38.080 --> 00:59:40.030
But in this way of
looking at things,

00:59:40.030 --> 00:59:45.520
you can see that we can very
easily compute the [INAUDIBLE]

00:59:45.520 --> 00:59:47.880
co-efficients and higher orders.

00:59:47.880 --> 00:59:49.490
In particular, the
third [INAUDIBLE]

00:59:49.490 --> 00:59:58.660
co-efficient we compute to be
1/8 minus 2 3 to the 5/2 lambda

00:59:58.660 --> 01:00:02.390
cubed over g squared.

01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:05.350
And you can keep
going and calculate

01:00:05.350 --> 01:00:07.540
higher and higher
order corrections.

01:00:10.869 --> 01:00:11.660
AUDIENCE: Question.

01:00:11.660 --> 01:00:12.620
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:00:12.620 --> 01:00:16.225
AUDIENCE: So if you're doing
this expansion for the z being

01:00:16.225 --> 01:00:16.745
close to 0--

01:00:16.745 --> 01:00:17.370
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:00:17.370 --> 01:00:19.286
AUDIENCE: --it appears
that chemical potential

01:00:19.286 --> 01:00:20.490
is a large negative number.

01:00:20.490 --> 01:00:22.020
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:00:22.020 --> 01:00:24.580
AUDIENCE: What
kind of interaction

01:00:24.580 --> 01:00:28.240
does it imply between our
grand canonical and [INAUDIBLE]

01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:30.240
and the system from
which it takes particles?

01:00:34.740 --> 01:00:37.990
Because chemical potential
represents energy threshold

01:00:37.990 --> 01:00:40.237
for the particle to
move from there to--

01:00:40.237 --> 01:00:40.820
PROFESSOR: OK.

01:00:40.820 --> 01:00:47.650
So as you say, it corresponds
to being large and negative.

01:00:47.650 --> 01:00:52.940
Which means that,
essentially, I think

01:00:52.940 --> 01:00:57.550
the more kind of physical way
of looking at it is-- this z

01:00:57.550 --> 01:01:01.980
is e to the beta mu-- is
the likelihood of grabbing

01:01:01.980 --> 01:01:04.800
and adding one particle
to your system.

01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:09.470
And what we have is that this
is much, much less than 1.

01:01:09.470 --> 01:01:11.610
And the way to
achieve that is to say

01:01:11.610 --> 01:01:16.080
that it is very hard to extract
and bring in other particle

01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:18.510
from whatever
reservoir you have.

01:01:18.510 --> 01:01:20.840
And because it is
so hard that you

01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:24.020
have such low density of
particles in the system

01:01:24.020 --> 01:01:25.000
that you have.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:30.390
So for example, if you are in
vacuum and you put a surface,

01:01:30.390 --> 01:01:33.360
and some atoms from
the surface detach

01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:36.390
and form a gas in
your container,

01:01:36.390 --> 01:01:39.140
the energetics of
binding those atoms

01:01:39.140 --> 01:01:42.760
to the substrate particles
was huge and few of them

01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:43.510
managed to escape.

01:01:50.980 --> 01:01:51.480
OK?

01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:04.250
All right.

01:02:04.250 --> 01:02:06.600
But this is only one limit.

01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:09.990
And this is the limit
that we already knew.

01:02:09.990 --> 01:02:13.450
We are really interested
in the other limit

01:02:13.450 --> 01:02:16.000
where we are quantum dominated.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.900
And clearly we want
to go to the limit

01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:22.930
where the argument
here is not small.

01:02:22.930 --> 01:02:26.650
I have to include a large
number of terms in this series.

01:02:26.650 --> 01:02:28.500
And then I have to
figure out what happens.

01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:32.960
I mean, how do I have
to treat the cases where

01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:41.970
I want to solve this equation
and the left hand side, d, is

01:02:41.970 --> 01:02:44.360
a large number?

01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:49.820
So how can I make the value
of the function large?

01:02:49.820 --> 01:02:53.263
What does that imply about
argument of the function?

01:02:53.263 --> 01:02:54.170
OK?

01:02:54.170 --> 01:02:57.070
So different functions
will become large

01:02:57.070 --> 01:03:00.080
for different values
of the argument.

01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:04.510
And as we will show
for the case of bosons,

01:03:04.510 --> 01:03:08.485
these functions become large
where the argument becomes 1.

01:03:08.485 --> 01:03:12.450
Whereas, for fermions, they
become large when the argument

01:03:12.450 --> 01:03:15.020
itself becomes very large.

01:03:15.020 --> 01:03:17.910
So the behavior of these
functions is very different.

01:03:17.910 --> 01:03:19.610
When they become
large they become

01:03:19.610 --> 01:03:21.765
large at different
points when we

01:03:21.765 --> 01:03:24.550
are thinking about
bosons and fermions.

01:03:24.550 --> 01:03:26.370
And because of
that, at this stage

01:03:26.370 --> 01:03:29.600
I have to separately
address the two problems.

01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:32.530
So up to here, the
high temperature limit,

01:03:32.530 --> 01:03:35.160
we sort of started
from the same point

01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:38.550
and branched off slightly by
going into boson and fermion

01:03:38.550 --> 01:03:39.500
direction.

01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:41.090
But when I go to
the other limit,

01:03:41.090 --> 01:03:44.050
I have to discuss the
two cases separately.

01:03:44.050 --> 01:03:48.452
So let's start with
the case of fermions.

01:04:12.860 --> 01:04:23.510
So degenerate-- degenerating
a sense of d being larger

01:04:23.510 --> 01:04:27.820
than 1 rather than
character flaws.

01:04:27.820 --> 01:04:31.380
So what do we do in this limit?

01:04:34.370 --> 01:04:39.450
So what I need to know is to
look at one of these functions.

01:04:39.450 --> 01:04:49.460
So let's say d n lambda
cubed over g is f 3/2 minus

01:04:49.460 --> 01:04:56.970
of z which is 1 over this
1/2 factorial integral 0

01:04:56.970 --> 01:05:03.590
to infinity dx x to the 1/2.

01:05:03.590 --> 01:05:05.840
And here I have a
plus because I'm

01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:09.300
looking at the fermionic
version of these.

01:05:09.300 --> 01:05:14.230
I have z inverse e to the
x and I can write that as e

01:05:14.230 --> 01:05:18.652
to the x minus log z.

01:05:18.652 --> 01:05:19.152
OK?

01:05:24.350 --> 01:05:30.400
Now, essentially, if I look
at this function-- actually,

01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:37.370
let's look at the function
that is just 1 over e

01:05:37.370 --> 01:05:46.450
to the x minus log z plus
1 as a function of x.

01:05:46.450 --> 01:05:51.510
What does it do in the
limit where z is large?

01:05:51.510 --> 01:05:56.370
In the limit where z is large,
log z is also very large.

01:05:56.370 --> 01:06:00.990
And then what I
have is something

01:06:00.990 --> 01:06:06.300
that if x is much less
than log z-- essentially,

01:06:06.300 --> 01:06:11.600
this factor will
be 0 and I have 1.

01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:15.540
Whereas if x is much
greater than log z,

01:06:15.540 --> 01:06:19.880
then this is exponentially large
quantity and I will have 0.

01:06:19.880 --> 01:06:24.540
So basically, at
around log z, this

01:06:24.540 --> 01:06:28.480
switches from being very
close to 0 to being 1.

01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:32.740
Indeed, that x equals
2 log z is exactly 1/2.

01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:34.960
So here is 1/2.

01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:37.440
It is switching very rapidly.

01:06:40.850 --> 01:06:43.770
And you can see
that, essentially,

01:06:43.770 --> 01:06:48.210
the value of the function
depends on the combination

01:06:48.210 --> 01:06:51.030
x minus log z.

01:06:51.030 --> 01:06:54.960
So if I were to make
log z much larger,

01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:59.390
I'm essentially transporting
this combination

01:06:59.390 --> 01:07:02.750
without changing its shape,
either in one direction

01:07:02.750 --> 01:07:05.220
or the other direction.

01:07:05.220 --> 01:07:07.450
OK?

01:07:07.450 --> 01:07:11.430
And if I go to the limit,
essentially that log z is

01:07:11.430 --> 01:07:16.290
very large, I will have 1
for a huge distance and then,

01:07:16.290 --> 01:07:20.080
at some point, I
would switch to 0.

01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:25.300
And what I'm doing, therefore,
is to essentially approximately

01:07:25.300 --> 01:07:32.680
integrating from 0 to
log z x to the 1/2 dx.

01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:39.531
Which would give me x to the
3/2-- sorry, log z to the 3/2

01:07:39.531 --> 01:07:40.030
over 3/2.

01:07:45.190 --> 01:07:46.750
And you can see
that I can repeat

01:07:46.750 --> 01:07:50.870
this for any other
value of m here.

01:07:50.870 --> 01:07:54.690
I would be integrating
x to the m minus 1.

01:07:54.690 --> 01:08:00.930
So you would conclude that the
limit as z is much, much larger

01:08:00.930 --> 01:08:08.390
than 1, of one of these
functions fm minus of z,

01:08:08.390 --> 01:08:12.890
is obtained by integrating
0 to log z dx x to the m.

01:08:12.890 --> 01:08:15.630
I will get another
factor of log z.

01:08:15.630 --> 01:08:20.439
And then I will get
log z to the power

01:08:20.439 --> 01:08:24.359
of m divided by 1
over m multiplying

01:08:24.359 --> 01:08:26.960
by 1 over m minus 1 factorial.

01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:28.390
It will give me m factorial.

01:08:35.020 --> 01:08:40.590
Now, of course there will
be correction to this

01:08:40.590 --> 01:08:44.510
because this function
would be equal to this

01:08:44.510 --> 01:08:49.029
if I was integrating
a step function.

01:08:49.029 --> 01:08:50.630
And I don't have
a step function.

01:08:50.630 --> 01:08:53.350
I have something that
gradually vanishes.

01:08:53.350 --> 01:08:56.460
Although, the interval
over which it vanishes

01:08:56.460 --> 01:09:00.180
is scaling much
smaller than log z.

01:09:00.180 --> 01:09:04.510
So what you can do, is you
can do some manipulations

01:09:04.510 --> 01:09:08.899
and calculate corrections
to this formula that

01:09:08.899 --> 01:09:14.250
become significant as log
z is not exactly infinite

01:09:14.250 --> 01:09:16.390
but becomes smaller and smaller.

01:09:16.390 --> 01:09:20.450
It turns out that that will
generate for you a series that

01:09:20.450 --> 01:09:23.340
is inverse powers of log z.

01:09:23.340 --> 01:09:27.760
And in fact, inverse
even powers of log z.

01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:31.760
So that the next term will fall
off as 1 over log z squared.

01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:36.390
The next term will fall off
as 1 over z to the fourth

01:09:36.390 --> 01:09:39.609
and so forth.

01:09:39.609 --> 01:09:43.350
And the coefficient of
the first one-- and I

01:09:43.350 --> 01:09:46.550
show you this in the notes,
how to calculate it--

01:09:46.550 --> 01:09:50.800
is pi squared over
6 times m m minus 1.

01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:53.082
The coefficient of
the next term is

01:09:53.082 --> 01:10:02.730
7 pi to the fourth 360 m m
minus 1, m minus 2, m minus 3.

01:10:02.730 --> 01:10:05.740
And there's a formula
for subsequent terms

01:10:05.740 --> 01:10:08.740
in the series, how
they are generated.

01:10:08.740 --> 01:10:11.940
And this thing is known as
the Sommerfeld expansion.

01:10:23.083 --> 01:10:23.583
OK?

01:10:28.030 --> 01:10:38.290
So, essentially, if you
plot as a function of z one

01:10:38.290 --> 01:10:43.670
of these fm minuses of
z's, what we have according

01:10:43.670 --> 01:10:48.110
to the previous
expansion, as you go to z

01:10:48.110 --> 01:10:52.350
equals to 0 you have
a linear function z.

01:10:52.350 --> 01:10:55.240
And then the next correction
is minus z squared.

01:10:55.240 --> 01:10:57.920
You start to bend
in this direction.

01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:00.540
And then you have higher
order corrections.

01:11:00.540 --> 01:11:04.340
What we see, that at larger
values, it keeps growing.

01:11:04.340 --> 01:11:07.850
And the growth at
larger values is this.

01:11:07.850 --> 01:11:12.815
So here you have z minus z
squared 2 to the power of m.

01:11:12.815 --> 01:11:18.150
Out here you have log z
to the m over m factorial.

01:11:18.150 --> 01:11:22.980
And then this corrections
from the Sommerfeld expansion.

01:11:22.980 --> 01:11:24.710
OK?

01:11:24.710 --> 01:11:28.700
And so once we
have that function,

01:11:28.700 --> 01:11:33.630
which is the right hand
side of this equality,

01:11:33.630 --> 01:11:39.440
for a particular density we are
asking, what is the value of z?

01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:45.210
And at low densities we are
evaluating solutions here.

01:11:45.210 --> 01:11:49.250
At high values of
density we are picking up

01:11:49.250 --> 01:11:52.250
solutions on this other.

01:11:52.250 --> 01:11:54.270
OK?

01:11:54.270 --> 01:11:58.810
So let's imagine that we
are indeed in that limit.

01:11:58.810 --> 01:12:01.250
So what do we have?

01:12:01.250 --> 01:12:13.360
We have that n lambda
cubed over g is log z

01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:18.240
to the 3/2 over 3/2 factorial.

01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:21.080
That's the leading term.

01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:26.920
Sub-leading term is 1
plus pi squared over 6.

01:12:26.920 --> 01:12:29.870
m, in our case, is 3/2.

01:12:29.870 --> 01:12:35.480
m minus 1 would be 1/2
divided by log z squared.

01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:36.850
I will stop at this order.

01:12:36.850 --> 01:12:40.120
That's all we will need.

01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:45.670
And so I will use this to
calculate z as a function n.

01:12:45.670 --> 01:12:48.090
Again, same procedure as before.

01:12:48.090 --> 01:12:50.610
I can invert this
and write this as log

01:12:50.610 --> 01:12:58.905
z being 3/2 factorial
n lambda cubed over g.

01:12:58.905 --> 01:13:01.170
so I multiplied by this.

01:13:01.170 --> 01:13:06.580
I have to raise to the 2/3
power-- the inverse of 3/2.

01:13:06.580 --> 01:13:09.260
I take this combination
to the other side.

01:13:09.260 --> 01:13:11.250
So I have 1.

01:13:11.250 --> 01:13:17.440
This becomes plus pi
squared over 8 1 over log z

01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:21.280
squared raised to
the minus 2/3 power

01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:24.157
because I had to take
it to the other side.

01:13:28.447 --> 01:13:28.947
OK.

01:13:32.790 --> 01:13:40.270
So at the lowest order,
what I need to do

01:13:40.270 --> 01:13:46.100
is to calculate log z from the
zeroed order term and then,

01:13:46.100 --> 01:13:52.220
at the next order, substitute
that value of log z in here

01:13:52.220 --> 01:13:54.740
and get the next correction.

01:13:54.740 --> 01:13:59.024
So the lowest order correction
will tell me that log z---

01:13:59.024 --> 01:14:03.470
which, remind you,
is simply beta mu--

01:14:03.470 --> 01:14:09.100
is this combination
raised to the 2/3 power.

01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:13.280
What is that communication?

01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:14.580
3/2 factorial.

01:14:14.580 --> 01:14:20.860
3/2 factorial we saw
was 3/2 1/2 factorial--

01:14:20.860 --> 01:14:25.220
which was root pi over 2--
so this is 3/2 factorial.

01:14:25.220 --> 01:14:32.990
I have n over g.

01:14:32.990 --> 01:14:34.800
Oh, sorry. n lambda cubed.

01:14:37.490 --> 01:14:43.170
So write it in this
fashion. n over g.

01:14:43.170 --> 01:14:46.905
And then I have lambda cubed.

01:14:49.470 --> 01:14:55.450
Let me put this to the 2/3
power because lambda cubed

01:14:55.450 --> 01:14:59.180
to the 2/3 power is
simply lambda squared.

01:14:59.180 --> 01:15:02.560
And lambda squared is
going to be h squared

01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:06.560
divided by 2 pi mkT.

01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:07.848
So this is lambda cubed.

01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:13.270
What I'm going to do
is notice that one

01:15:13.270 --> 01:15:17.890
of these h over 2pi's is
in fact already an h bar.

01:15:17.890 --> 01:15:20.340
I'd like to write
the result in terms

01:15:20.340 --> 01:15:25.510
of h bar squared divided by 2m.

01:15:25.510 --> 01:15:29.380
The 1 over kT I
can write as beta.

01:15:29.380 --> 01:15:32.800
Ultimately, it is my intention
to cancel that beta which

01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:37.200
is the 1 over kT in the
beta that I have out here.

01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:41.180
And I get the value for mu.

01:15:41.180 --> 01:15:42.600
OK?

01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:50.340
To go from h squared over
2pi to h bar squared over 2m,

01:15:50.340 --> 01:15:54.320
I need a factor of 4pi squared.

01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:59.200
Those 4pi squared I will
put out front in here.

01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:05.600
And they will change the result
to something that is like this.

01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:12.270
It is n over g is going
to be remaining there.

01:16:12.270 --> 01:16:19.240
I have pi by the time it
gets in front over here

01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:20.950
becomes pi to the 3/2.

01:16:20.950 --> 01:16:27.450
Pi to the 3/2 multiplied by pi
to the 1/2 becomes pi squared.

01:16:27.450 --> 01:16:30.490
You can convince yourself
that the factors of 2

01:16:30.490 --> 01:16:33.740
and all of those things
manage to give you

01:16:33.740 --> 01:16:41.090
something that is 6pi squared
n over g to the 2/3 power.

01:16:41.090 --> 01:16:42.230
Yes?

01:16:42.230 --> 01:16:44.886
AUDIENCE: So when [INAUDIBLE]
chemical potential

01:16:44.886 --> 01:16:46.840
as no temperature [INAUDIBLE].

01:16:46.840 --> 01:16:47.780
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

01:16:47.780 --> 01:16:52.183
When you go to 0 temperature,
the chemical potential

01:16:52.183 --> 01:16:55.750
of a Fermi gas
goes to a constant

01:16:55.750 --> 01:16:58.320
that you have actually
seen-- and I just

01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:02.580
was about to make it clear
to you what that constant is.

01:17:02.580 --> 01:17:08.490
So we get that limit as
essentially this T goes

01:17:08.490 --> 01:17:13.550
to 0, which is another way of
achieving the combination n

01:17:13.550 --> 01:17:16.020
lambda cubed over
g goes to infinity.

01:17:16.020 --> 01:17:18.620
When T goes to 0,
lambda goes to infinity,

01:17:18.620 --> 01:17:21.980
this combination becomes large.

01:17:21.980 --> 01:17:25.530
Canceling the betas,
the limit of mu

01:17:25.530 --> 01:17:30.000
is something that potentially
in solid state courses

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.750
you have seen as
the fermion energy.

01:17:32.750 --> 01:17:38.160
And the fermion energy
is h bar squared over 2m.

01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:42.340
Some Fermi momentum squared.

01:17:42.340 --> 01:17:45.780
And hopefully the
Fermi momentum is

01:17:45.780 --> 01:17:51.092
going to come out to be 6pi
squared n over g to the 1/3.

01:17:51.092 --> 01:17:55.290
And one way that you usually
get your Fermi momentum is

01:17:55.290 --> 01:17:57.705
you say that, what
I need to do is

01:17:57.705 --> 01:18:04.460
to fill up all of this state
up to some value of kf.

01:18:04.460 --> 01:18:07.182
And the number of
states that there are

01:18:07.182 --> 01:18:10.680
is the volume of the
sphere- 4pi over 3k

01:18:10.680 --> 01:18:15.650
f cubed, of course times the
volume times the degeneracy

01:18:15.650 --> 01:18:19.310
coming from spins if I have
multiple possibilities.

01:18:19.310 --> 01:18:22.840
And this should give
me the total number n.

01:18:37.540 --> 01:18:39.970
Ah.

01:18:39.970 --> 01:18:41.980
I made some big mistake here.

01:18:41.980 --> 01:18:43.626
Can somebody point it out to me?

01:18:49.340 --> 01:18:54.080
How do we calculate Fermi
momentum and Fermi [INAUDIBLE]?

01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:56.100
Not coming out
the answer I want.

01:18:56.100 --> 01:18:58.157
AUDIENCE: One [INAUDIBLE]
is a sphere, right?

01:18:58.157 --> 01:18:58.740
PROFESSOR: No.

01:18:58.740 --> 01:19:00.219
It's a sphere.

01:19:00.219 --> 01:19:01.698
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:19:01.698 --> 01:19:03.180
PROFESSOR: Thank you.

01:19:03.180 --> 01:19:04.770
Divide by density of state.

01:19:04.770 --> 01:19:09.880
I multiplied by the V but I
forgot the 2pi cubed here.

01:19:09.880 --> 01:19:11.120
OK?

01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:16.100
So when you divide 4pi
divided by 8pi cubed,

01:19:16.100 --> 01:19:19.980
you will have 2pi
squared times 3,

01:19:19.980 --> 01:19:25.850
which will give you 6pi squared.

01:19:25.850 --> 01:19:28.520
n over V is the density.

01:19:28.520 --> 01:19:31.130
Divided by g.

01:19:31.130 --> 01:19:38.680
So you can see that we
get the right result.

01:19:38.680 --> 01:19:39.180
Yes?

01:19:39.180 --> 01:19:41.540
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] cubed.

01:19:41.540 --> 01:19:43.110
PROFESSOR: f cubed.

01:19:43.110 --> 01:19:44.670
Yes.

01:19:44.670 --> 01:19:45.493
That's right.

01:19:45.493 --> 01:19:48.934
So kf is 1/3 of that.

01:19:48.934 --> 01:19:50.656
Let's go step by step.

01:19:50.656 --> 01:19:55.870
A is 6pi squared n
over g to the 1/3.

01:19:55.870 --> 01:20:02.290
kf squared would be the
2/3 power [? of g. ?] Yes?

01:20:02.290 --> 01:20:04.460
AUDIENCE: So you said that
this is the lowest order

01:20:04.460 --> 01:20:06.069
term for the chemical potential.

01:20:06.069 --> 01:20:06.860
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

01:20:06.860 --> 01:20:07.360
Yes.

01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:10.370
AUDIENCE: But aren't there
going to be maybe a second order

01:20:10.370 --> 01:20:12.290
temperature dependent term?

01:20:12.290 --> 01:20:13.160
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:20:13.160 --> 01:20:17.780
So when we substitute
that formula in here,

01:20:17.780 --> 01:20:21.140
we will find the value of
the chemical potential.

01:20:21.140 --> 01:20:23.440
So I will draw it
for you and then

01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:25.630
recalculate the result later.

01:20:25.630 --> 01:20:27.680
So this is the
chemical potential

01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:32.960
of the Fermi system as a
function of its temperature.

01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:35.280
What did we establish so far?

01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:37.195
We established that
at zero temperature

01:20:37.195 --> 01:20:40.480
it is in fact epsilon f.

01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:42.790
We had established that
at high temperature--

01:20:42.790 --> 01:20:44.740
this was the discussion
we had before-- it's

01:20:44.740 --> 01:20:45.990
large and negative.

01:20:45.990 --> 01:20:48.830
It is down here.

01:20:48.830 --> 01:20:52.090
So indeed the behavior
of the chemical potential

01:20:52.090 --> 01:20:55.830
of the Fermi gas as a
function of temperature

01:20:55.830 --> 01:20:58.200
is something like this.

01:20:58.200 --> 01:21:03.420
And so the chemical potential at
zero temperature is epsilon f.

01:21:03.420 --> 01:21:08.290
As you go to finite temperature,
it will get reduced by a factor

01:21:08.290 --> 01:21:10.925
that I will just calculate.

01:21:10.925 --> 01:21:12.830
OK?

01:21:12.830 --> 01:21:19.050
So if I now substitute
this result in here

01:21:19.050 --> 01:21:21.350
to get the next
correction, what do I have?

01:21:21.350 --> 01:21:21.850
OK.

01:21:21.850 --> 01:21:25.090
So this zero to order
term we established

01:21:25.090 --> 01:21:28.965
is the same thing
as beta epsilon f.

01:21:31.550 --> 01:21:38.480
And then the next order term
will be 1 plus-- this log

01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:42.850
z is going to be small--
minus 2/3 times this

01:21:42.850 --> 01:21:46.455
is going to give me
minus pi squared over 6.

01:21:49.880 --> 01:21:50.860
Right?

01:21:50.860 --> 01:21:53.970
And then I have 1
over log z squared.

01:21:53.970 --> 01:21:59.830
One over log z is simply
1 over beta epsilon f

01:21:59.830 --> 01:22:08.880
which is the same thing as
kT over epsilon f squared So

01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:16.780
what we see is that the
chemical potential starts

01:22:16.780 --> 01:22:22.310
to be epsilon f and then it
starts to go down parabolically

01:22:22.310 --> 01:22:25.180
in temperature.

01:22:25.180 --> 01:22:30.300
And the first correction is of
the order of kT over epsilon f.

01:22:30.300 --> 01:22:34.110
Not surprisingly,
it will go to 0

01:22:34.110 --> 01:22:42.040
at the value T that is off the
order of epsilon f over kT.

01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:44.310
So the chemical potential
of the Fermi gas

01:22:44.310 --> 01:22:45.850
actually changes sign.

01:22:45.850 --> 01:22:48.890
It's negative and large
at high temperature,

01:22:48.890 --> 01:22:50.810
it goes to the
Fermi energy which

01:22:50.810 --> 01:22:54.820
is positive at low temperatures.

01:22:54.820 --> 01:23:00.270
So once we know this behavior
or the chemical potential,

01:23:00.270 --> 01:23:04.810
we can calculate what the
energy and pressure on.

01:23:04.810 --> 01:23:07.630
And again, at zero
temperature you

01:23:07.630 --> 01:23:10.360
will have some energy which
comes from filling out

01:23:10.360 --> 01:23:15.430
this Fermi C. And then we
will get corrections to energy

01:23:15.430 --> 01:23:19.030
and pressure that
we can calculate

01:23:19.030 --> 01:23:21.970
using the types of
formulas that we have that

01:23:21.970 --> 01:23:27.180
relate pressure and
energy to f 5/2 of z.

01:23:27.180 --> 01:23:30.420
And so we can start to
calculate the corrections

01:23:30.420 --> 01:23:33.940
that you have to
completely Fermi sphere.

01:23:33.940 --> 01:23:35.750
And how those
corrections give you,

01:23:35.750 --> 01:23:38.690
say, the linear heat
capacity is something

01:23:38.690 --> 01:23:41.046
that we will derive next time.
