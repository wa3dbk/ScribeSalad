00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:28.555
PROFESSOR: Last time, we looked
at the case of a Bose gas,

00:00:28.555 --> 00:00:31.240
and we found that there
was this condensation

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.895
phenomena into the ground state.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.850
Let's go over it one more time.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.420
So the idea was
that when you have

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.350
a Bose system, the occupation
of the different one-particle

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:54.210
states, which you can specify
for a non-interacting system

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.990
in the grand canonical
ensemble, these entities

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:03.240
are independent for each one
of the one-particle states

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.340
and have a form that is related
to the chemical potential

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:16.890
and the energy of these states
through this form, epsilon

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.880
[? kd ?] in the
one-particle state,

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.100
and z standing for e to the
beta mu, chemical potential

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.950
divided by temperature.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.110
OK?

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.140
Now, if we go and look
at this in the limit

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.110
where z is much
less than 1, which

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.530
is appropriate to
high temperatures

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.390
or when the case where the
gas is mostly classical,

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.680
you can expand this.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.160
You can see that in
the lowest order,

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.270
it is z e to the minus
beta epsilon of k.

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.840
So it looks like a
standard Boltzmann weight

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.540
that we would use in classical
statistical mechanics.

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.440
But then there are
higher order terms.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.415
And in particular there
would be a correction

00:02:05.415 --> 00:02:10.130
that is e to the minus
beta epsilon of k squared

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:15.270
and so forth that would
modify this result.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.910
But I think this is
something that I mentioned.

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.790
If you look at a form such
as this at high temperatures,

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.970
it's like a Boltzmann weight.

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.470
So the state that has
this lowest energy,

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.040
in this case if we
say epsilon of k

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.640
is h bar squared k squared
over 2m corresponding to k

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.360
equals to 0 for
the lowest energy,

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:46.244
has the highest mean
occupation number of weight.

00:02:46.244 --> 00:02:47.690
OK?

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.060
Now that is always the case.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.310
This is a function
that, as epsilon of k

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.610
becomes larger, no matter
whether you expand it or not,

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.790
becomes less and less.

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.310
The other limit that
is of interest to us

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.370
is how big can z be?

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:12.890
We said that the largest it
can be is when it approaches 1.

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.340
And when it is 1, this
quantity, the occupation number,

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.750
is e to the beta
epsilon of k minus 1.

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.650
Again, something that is
largest as k becomes smaller,

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.050
and you go to the lowest energy.

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.560
But there is the difficulty that
the one energy that corresponds

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.450
to k equals to 0, if I
look at this formula,

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.300
it is 1 divided by 0.

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.970
It just doesn't
make too much sense.

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.130
Now, of course, we
said that typically we

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:54.490
don't want to work
in this variable.

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:56.730
We want to figure out
things as a function

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.580
of the number of particles or
the number of particles divided

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:06.220
by volume density, which is
a nice intensive quantity.

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.720
OK?

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.010
So typically, what should we do?

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.650
We said that in the
grand canonical ensemble,

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:19.930
N is the sum over k
these expectation values.

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.060
I should really put
an average here,

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.820
but we said that in the
thermodynamic sense,

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.580
fluctuations being of the
order of square root of N,

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.074
we are going to ignore.

00:04:29.074 --> 00:04:30.490
So this is what
you would normally

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.530
call the number that
we have in the system.

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:41.240
And then you have to replace
this sum in the limit

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.420
where we have a large
system with an integral.

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:51.540
So we have the integral
d cubed k 2 pi cubed V.

00:04:51.540 --> 00:05:00.230
And then we have this N of k,
which is 1 over z inverse e

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:03.710
to the beta epsilon
of k minus 1.

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:13.040
Now if I go like I did in
the line above to the limit

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:17.650
where z is much less
than 1, then the integral

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:25.670
that I have to do is
simply the integral of z e

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:29.840
to the minus beta epsilon k
h bar squared k squared 2m.

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:34.290
We know what this is.

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:37.520
This is simply, up
to a factor of z,

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.680
these are the integrals
that have given me

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.745
these factors of 1
over lambda cubed.

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:48.890
Actually, there's
the factor of V

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:51.004
here, so it is V
over lambda cubed.

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:57.790
So normally, you would
then solve for z,

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:04.760
and you would find that z is
the density times lambda cubed.

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:08.450
And this is a formula that we
have seen a number of times,

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:14.356
that the chemical potential
is kt log of n lambda cubed.

00:06:14.356 --> 00:06:16.690
OK?

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:17.190
Fine.

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:19.140
But now we are interested
in the other limit.

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:26.791
Now in the other limit,
we have this difficulty

00:06:26.791 --> 00:06:32.430
that this quantity, if I look
at it as a function of z,

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:34.140
this is the quantity
that we would

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:40.420
call f-- it is
related to f 3/2 of z.

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:48.080
So this is going to be 1 over
lambda cubed f 3/2 plus of z.

00:06:48.080 --> 00:07:00.560
It's a function that increases
with z up to the limiting value

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.240
that we are allowed to have,
which is at z equals to 1.

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:08.380
It's a function that starts
linearly, as we have discussed,

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:14.360
but then up here, it comes to
a finite value of zeta 3/2.

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:17.990
OK?

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:26.030
So basically, we know that when
I evaluate this for finite z,

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:28.730
I'm less than where I was here.

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:33.650
So this is certainly less
than 1 over lambda cubed zeta

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:36.970
of 3/2, the limiting value
that we have over here.

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:42.730
So now I have a difficulty.

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:50.710
This function over here,
I can only make it so big.

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:53.670
But I need to make
it big enough so

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:57.740
that I can put enough particles,
the total number of particles

00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:00.200
that I have in the system.

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:02.720
So what is happening over here?

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:09.490
What is happening is that when
I make this density larger

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:13.730
and larger, ultimately
when I hit this point at z

00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:17.470
equals to 1, as
we have discussed

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:23.160
there is an uncertainty as to
what happens to this expression

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:26.600
when z is equal to 1,
and you are at this state

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:30.020
that corresponds
to k equals to 0.

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:30.520
Right?

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:33.559
I don't know how many
things are over there.

00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:36.400
So I can have, in
principle, the freedom

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:41.380
to take advantage of the fact
that I don't know what 1 over 0

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:47.950
is to call that the number
that I need to make up

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:51.342
the difference between
here and there.

00:08:51.342 --> 00:08:53.440
OK?

00:08:53.440 --> 00:09:02.460
And so, in principle,
when z goes to 1,

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:09.670
then this becomes 1 over lambda
cubed, or V over lambda cubed,

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:14.130
zeta of 3/2, obtained
by essentially

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:17.290
doing the integration
with z equals to 1,

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:21.280
evaluating it at
this possible limit.

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:25.580
And then whatever
is left, I will

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:29.560
put in the k equals to 0 state.

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:30.610
OK?

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:35.070
And you will say, well, what
does that explicitly mean?

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:44.910
Well, what it means is that
I'm really evaluating things

00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:50.620
at the value of z that
is extremely close to 1

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:54.290
so that in the thermodynamic
limit where N goes to infinity

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:57.240
I wouldn't know the difference.

00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:01.240
But it is really something
that vanishes only

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:05.120
in that thermodynamic limit
of N going to infinity.

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:09.510
And we saw that if I kind
of look at the occupation

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:15.050
number of the k equals
to 0 state, what it is

00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:27.220
is z inverse, which is e to
the minus beta mu minus 1.

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:31.250
And if I'm in the limit
where z is very small,

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:36.650
or beta mu is-- sorry, z
is very much close to 1

00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:41.430
or beta mu is very small,
then I can expand this.

00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:47.930
And this becomes approximately,
when mu goes to 0,

00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:49.718
minus 1 over beta mu.

00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:55.230
OK?

00:10:55.230 --> 00:11:00.130
And I want this
to be the N0, what

00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:05.040
is left over when I subtract
from the total number

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:11.520
the amount that I can put
in to the ground state.

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:13.010
OK?

00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:17.820
And so you can see that this is
a quantity that is extensive.

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:21.130
It is proportional to
the number of particles.

00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:26.670
And mu is the inverse of
that, so it is infinitesimal.

00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:31.480
And if I choose that value
of mu that is, essentially,

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:35.540
pushing z infinitesimally
close to 1,

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:41.088
then I can ensure that I have
a finite occupation over there.

00:11:41.088 --> 00:11:43.020
OK?

00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:44.150
So what does it mean?

00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:50.220
If I could actually look at
these occupation numbers,

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:58.070
then I am at temperatures
less than Tc of n.

00:11:58.070 --> 00:12:00.010
And we saw that
basically we could

00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:03.300
get what the temperature
is when this happens

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:11.180
by equating this combination
g over lambda cubed,

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:15.090
in principle, over-- I
had said g equals to 1.

00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:18.220
I could repeat it
with g not equal to 1.

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:26.210
And n, which is g over
lambda cubed zeta of 3/2,

00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:29.640
rather than f 3/2 plus,
this defines for me

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:33.345
this temperature Tc of n.

00:12:33.345 --> 00:12:36.180
OK?

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:42.060
Now, if I could look at
the occupation numbers

00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:46.070
when I was at temperature less
than Tc, what would I see?

00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:52.520
I would see that the occupation
number as a function of k

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:56.230
is exactly the form that we
have over here with z equals

00:12:56.230 --> 00:13:07.830
to 1, 1 over e to the
beta epsilon of k minus 1.

00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:11.870
But then at k
equals to 0, which I

00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:16.370
can indicate by some
kind of delta function,

00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:20.360
I have everybody else,
which is this N minus

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:22.910
V over lambda cubed zeta of 3/2.

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:28.090
OK?

00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:34.200
Actually, let's remember
that our k and momentum

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:36.650
are related to each other.

00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:42.620
So rather than asking
what the density is

00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:46.360
as a function of this
label k, I can maybe

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:49.350
ask what the density
is for things

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:52.390
that have different momentum P.

00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:54.250
And according to
this formula, it

00:13:54.250 --> 00:14:00.000
is going to be beta P squared
over 2m, this kind of modified

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.140
version of the Boltzmann weight,
and a delta function at P

00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:08.220
equals to 0 there.

00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:12.340
The rest of the
particles are up here.

00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:17.070
Now, when people
saw the signature

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:22.080
of Bose-Einstein condensation,
it was precisely this.

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:29.910
So this is the figure
that shows this

00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:34.420
from the experiment of
Eric Cornell and group,

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:39.920
and you see two thermometers.

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:43.420
They are cooling the
temperature of this gas

00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:46.740
of atoms that is
confined in a trap.

00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:48.390
The way that they
are cooling it is

00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:52.570
that they are evaporating away
the high energy particles.

00:14:52.570 --> 00:14:55.460
And then the rest
of the particles

00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:58.780
are cooled down because they
thermalize, and the highest

00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:00.970
energy is always removed.

00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:03.285
But in the process,
the density in the trap

00:15:03.285 --> 00:15:05.760
is also being reduced.

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:12.660
And if the density goes down,
then Tc of n will also go down.

00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:16.780
So what is plotted over here
on the right thermometer

00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:21.450
is the Tc of n that you would
calculate from that formula.

00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:24.160
And on the right
thermometer is actually

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:27.000
the temperature of the
particles in the gas.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.660
And you can see that
right at some point, then

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:35.390
the Tc of the particles in
the gas goes below Tc of n.

00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:38.220
And what is being plotted
over here is as follows.

00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:39.740
So you have the
particles that are

00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:44.180
in the trap at some temperature.

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:49.250
We remove the trap, and then the
particles are going to escape.

00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:51.330
The particles that
have zero momentum

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:53.410
are going to stay
where they are.

00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:55.480
The particles that
have large momentum

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:57.370
are going to go further away.

00:15:57.370 --> 00:16:00.570
So let's say after one
second you take a picture.

00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:03.910
And what you see over
here from the picture

00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:06.930
is over here there
are the particles that

00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:09.655
had most momentum
and ran further away.

00:16:09.655 --> 00:16:12.000
While at the center,
you see the particles

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.640
that had small momentum.

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:17.270
You can see that always,
even at high temperature,

00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:19.910
the zero momentum is the peak.

00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:24.190
But once you go below
this condition of Tc of n,

00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:28.650
in addition to the normal
peak that is over here,

00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:32.210
you get some additional
peak that is appearing at P

00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:35.130
equals to 0, which is
the condensation that you

00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:39.005
have into that one single state.

00:16:39.005 --> 00:16:39.505
OK?

00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:50.560
The other thing that I started
to do last time but let's

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:54.090
complete and finish
today is I wanted

00:16:54.090 --> 00:17:00.080
to show you the heat
capacity of this system.

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:00.580
OK.

00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:01.690
So how do we do that?

00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:05.240
So the first
formula that we had,

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:09.869
the one that I used over here
if I were to divide by V,

00:17:09.869 --> 00:17:15.050
is that the density, in general,
is given by g over lambda

00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:18.970
cubed f 3/2 plus of z.

00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:24.609
OK?

00:17:24.609 --> 00:17:29.480
And we said that if
z goes to 1, then I

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:32.770
have to interpret that
appropriately that this

00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:37.570
is really just excited
states, and there's

00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:41.020
going to be a separation
into the ground

00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:43.340
state and the excited states.

00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:48.660
So there is really two portions
of n when we are below Tc.

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:49.210
OK?

00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:52.010
But then there is also
a formula for pressure.

00:17:52.010 --> 00:18:00.480
Beta P was g over
lambda cubed f 5/2 of z.

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:06.680
Again, these f's we had
defined-- f plus m minus 1 of z

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:11.120
was 1 over m minus 1
factorial integral 0

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:17.470
to infinity dx x to the m
minus 1 z inverse e to the x

00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:20.000
plus 1-- minus 1.

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:24.740
OK?

00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:29.730
Fine.

00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:33.920
But in order to calculate
the heat capacity,

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:36.520
I need to work with the energy.

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:38.560
And we said that,
quite generally,

00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:41.610
whether you have
classical system,

00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:47.000
quantum gas, bosons, fermions,
the energy and pressure

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:52.680
are related simply by this
formula, which is ultimately

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:58.470
a consequence of the scaling of
the energy being proportional

00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:03.230
to momentum squared
that we have over there.

00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:05.280
OK?

00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:10.900
So let's look at this formula.

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:11.620
What do I have?

00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:19.020
For T that is less than Tc
of n, my z is equal to 1.

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:22.820
Pressure comes
entirely from particles

00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:24.900
that are moving around.

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:29.040
So although the density
breaks into two components,

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:31.970
in principle I guess I would
say that the pressure also

00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:34.190
breaks into two components.

00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:38.230
But the component that
is at k equals to 0

00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:39.410
is not moving around.

00:19:39.410 --> 00:19:43.180
It is not giving you any
contribution to the pressure.

00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:44.035
So what do we?

00:19:44.035 --> 00:19:50.460
We have P is kt, taking
the beta to the other side.

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:56.860
I have g over lambda cubed, and
then this f plus evaluated at z

00:19:56.860 --> 00:20:02.860
equals to 1, which is
this zeta function of 5/2.

00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:03.470
OK?

00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:05.210
So fine.

00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:08.490
So what do I have for energy?

00:20:08.490 --> 00:20:15.260
Energy is going to be at
3/2 V times this formula,

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:21.870
kd T g over lambda
cubed zeta 5/2.

00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:30.590
And I noticed that lambda, being
h square root of 2 pi mk T,

00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:33.950
scales like T to the minus 1/2.

00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:37.870
So 1 over lambda cubed
scales like T to the 3/2 plus

00:20:37.870 --> 00:20:40.890
this is something that's
scaling like T to the 5/2.

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:49.030
And this is simply proportional
to the volume and temperature

00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:50.780
to the [INAUDIBLE] fifth power.

00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:54.460
It knows nothing
about the density.

00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:55.010
Why?

00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:59.650
Because if you were at the
same temperature and volume,

00:20:59.650 --> 00:21:02.020
put more particle
in the system, all

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:04.630
of those additional
particles would go over here,

00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:10.370
would make no contribution
to pressure or to energy.

00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:12.420
You wouldn't see them.

00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:16.450
So once you have this, the heat
capacity at constant volume,

00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:24.860
dE by dT, is simply 5 over
2T of whatever energy is.

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:41.300
And there is a reason that
I write it in this fashion.

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:43.810
So what you would
say is that if I

00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:50.030
were to plot the heat
capacity at constant volume

00:21:50.030 --> 00:21:56.040
as a function of
temperature, well,

00:21:56.040 --> 00:22:01.646
it's natural units are
of the order of kB.

00:22:01.646 --> 00:22:05.800
You can see that this T and
this T I can cancel out.

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:08.280
So I have something
that has units of kB.

00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:11.940
It is extensive
proportional to volume.

00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:17.600
I can really certainly
write it in this fashion.

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:24.090
And what I have
is that the curve

00:22:24.090 --> 00:22:27.881
behaves like T to the 3/2.

00:22:27.881 --> 00:22:31.130
So this is proportional
to T to the 3/2.

00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:41.530
And presumably, this behavior
continues all the way

00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:48.820
until the temperature at
which this system ceases

00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:51.610
to be a Bose-Einstein
condensate.

00:22:51.610 --> 00:22:55.530
So the low temperature form of
the heat capacity's calculation

00:22:55.530 --> 00:22:58.840
is very simple.

00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:01.530
Now, at very high
temperatures, we

00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:09.090
know that the heat capacity is
going to be 3/2 N kT, right?

00:23:09.090 --> 00:23:16.190
So ultimately, I know that if
I go to very high temperatures,

00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:23.300
my heat capacity is
going to be 3/2 N,

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:28.530
if I divide it by [? kB. ?] OK?

00:23:28.530 --> 00:23:32.080
Now, there is a reason
that I drew this line

00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:35.160
over here less
than the peak here.

00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:44.030
Well, in order to calculate
the heat capacity on this side,

00:23:44.030 --> 00:23:46.860
we'll have to do a
little bit more work.

00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:54.980
You can no longer assume
that z equals to 1.

00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:58.580
z is something
that is less than 1

00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:02.790
that is obtained by
solving N equals to g over

00:24:02.790 --> 00:24:07.050
lambda cubed f 3/2 plus of z.

00:24:07.050 --> 00:24:08.770
OK?

00:24:08.770 --> 00:24:12.200
But I can still presumably
use these formulae.

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:17.670
I have that the
energy is 3/2 PV.

00:24:17.670 --> 00:24:25.760
So I have V kT times--
what is the thing

00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:27.400
that I have on the
right-hand side?

00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:31.940
It is g over lambda cubed,
just as I have over here

00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:38.130
except that I have to
put f 5/2 plus of z.

00:24:38.130 --> 00:24:41.100
OK?

00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:44.800
And if I want to calculate
the heat capacity, what

00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:46.700
I need to do is to
take a derivative

00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:51.020
of the energy with
respect to temperature.

00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:55.790
And then I notice, well,
again, right like I had before,

00:24:55.790 --> 00:24:58.996
whatever appears here is
proportional to T to the 5/2.

00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:04.950
So when I take a derivative
with respect to temperature,

00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:10.850
I essentially get 5/2 this
whole quantity divided by T.

00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:14.300
So just like I had over
here, I will write the result

00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:22.220
as 3/2 V kT g over lambda cubed.

00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:31.290
And then I have the 5/2 1
over T of f 5/2 plus of z.

00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:39.380
But you say that's the
wrong way of doing things

00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:45.680
because in addition to this
combination out front be

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:50.300
explicitly proportional
to T to the 5/2 power,

00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:55.230
this factor z here is implicitly
a function of temperature

00:25:55.230 --> 00:25:59.380
because it is related to density
through that formula N equals

00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:04.450
to g over lambda
cubed f 5/2 plus of z.

00:26:04.450 --> 00:26:07.760
So you should not forget to
take the derivative of what

00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:11.660
is over here with
respect to T. OK?

00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:15.110
So what do I get when I take a
derivative of this with respect

00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:16.110
to T?

00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:22.230
Well, the argument
is not T, it is z.

00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:25.740
So I will have to
take a dz by dT,

00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:31.100
and then the derivative of
f 5/2 with respect to z.

00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:33.500
And we saw that one
of the characteristics

00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:35.860
of these functions
was that when we

00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:39.270
took the derivative
of each one of them,

00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:42.170
we generated one with
a lower argument.

00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:46.270
So the derivative would
be f 3/2 plus of z.

00:26:46.270 --> 00:26:49.200
But in order to have this
[? latter ?] property,

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:54.900
I had to do a z d by
dz, and so I essentially

00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:59.160
need to restore
this 1 over z here.

00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:05.140
So you can see that, really,
the difference between what

00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:10.830
I had at low temperatures
and high temperatures,

00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:15.110
at low temperatures this was
just a number that I was using

00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:17.400
over here, zeta of
5/2, and I didn't

00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:19.407
have to bother about
this other term.

00:27:22.270 --> 00:27:27.000
Now, we can figure out what
the behavior of this term

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:31.350
is certainly at
small z because we

00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:34.920
have the expansion of
these functions at small z.

00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:40.000
And if you do sufficient
work, you will find-- well,

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.280
first of all, at the
largest values of z-- sorry,

00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:46.790
at the smallest
value, z going to 0,

00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:52.150
you can confirm that the heat
capacity in units of N kB

00:27:52.150 --> 00:27:54.060
is simply 3/2.

00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:57.900
So you will come to
this line over here,

00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:02.610
and then the first correction
that you calculate you'll find

00:28:02.610 --> 00:28:06.220
is going to take you
in that direction.

00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:09.730
Actually, if you do the
calculation for bosons

00:28:09.730 --> 00:28:11.960
and fermions at
high temperatures,

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:14.890
you can convince yourself
that while bosons

00:28:14.890 --> 00:28:18.615
will go in this direction,
fermions, the heat capacity,

00:28:18.615 --> 00:28:22.610
will start to go in
the other direction.

00:28:22.610 --> 00:28:25.950
But OK, so you
have this behavior.

00:28:25.950 --> 00:28:28.080
And then what we
haven't established

00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:31.440
and the reason that I'm still
doing all of this algebra

00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:34.850
is that, OK, this
curve is going up,

00:28:34.850 --> 00:28:37.990
where is it going to end up?

00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:40.540
Is it going to
end up here, here,

00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:43.790
or right where this curve hits?

00:28:43.790 --> 00:28:45.080
OK?

00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:48.180
And what I will show
you is that this

00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:54.290
has to end up right
at this point.

00:28:54.290 --> 00:29:00.440
And actually, in order to
show that, all we need to do

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:06.540
is to figure out what these
terms do when I evaluate them

00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:09.660
at z equals to 1.

00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:12.690
And because these
things are telling

00:29:12.690 --> 00:29:16.105
me what is happening as I am
approaching to this point,

00:29:16.105 --> 00:29:19.360
the question that I ask is,
what is the limiting behavior

00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:23.800
of this function as I
get to z equals to 1?

00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:26.070
But the limiting value
of this one I know.

00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:28.340
It is precisely what
I want over here.

00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:31.110
It is zeta of 5/2.

00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:36.572
So I have to somehow show
you that this next term is 0.

00:29:36.572 --> 00:29:41.580
Well, this next term,
however, depends on dz by dT.

00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:44.110
How can I get that?

00:29:44.110 --> 00:29:47.170
Well, all of these things
are done under the conditions

00:29:47.170 --> 00:29:50.040
where the volume is fixed,
or the number of particles

00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:52.390
is fixed, if the
density is fixed.

00:29:52.390 --> 00:29:58.090
So z and T are related
through the formula that

00:29:58.090 --> 00:30:03.450
says N over V, which
is the density,

00:30:03.450 --> 00:30:09.260
is g over lambda
cubed f 3/2 plus of z.

00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:10.520
OK?

00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:14.450
So if I take the system and
I change its temperature,

00:30:14.450 --> 00:30:17.540
while keeping the number
of particles, volume,

00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:20.300
fixed so that the
density is fixed,

00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:25.270
if I take d by dT on both
sides, on the other side

00:30:25.270 --> 00:30:29.550
I'm assuming that I'm doing the
calculations under conditions

00:30:29.550 --> 00:30:31.970
where the density
does not change.

00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:34.740
And then what do
I have over here?

00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:38.030
I have to take the temperature
derivative of this.

00:30:38.030 --> 00:30:40.180
There's an implicit
derivative here

00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:44.280
since this is T to the
3/2 proportionately.

00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:52.150
So when I take a derivative,
I will get 3 over 2T,

00:30:52.150 --> 00:30:59.030
and then I will have
f 3/2 plus of z.

00:30:59.030 --> 00:31:03.550
But then I have to take
the derivative that

00:31:03.550 --> 00:31:06.565
is implicit in the
dependence on z here.

00:31:06.565 --> 00:31:14.250
And that's going to
be identical to this,

00:31:14.250 --> 00:31:17.960
except that when I take
a derivative of f 3/2,

00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:23.660
I will generate f 1/2 of z.

00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:25.030
OK?

00:31:25.030 --> 00:31:29.690
So since the left-hand
side is equal to 0,

00:31:29.690 --> 00:31:31.850
I can immediately
solve for this,

00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:39.590
and I find that T
dz by dT 1 over z

00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:51.920
is minus 3/2 f 3/2 plus of z
divided by f 1/2 plus of z.

00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:54.360
OK?

00:31:54.360 --> 00:32:02.370
So essentially, what I can do
is I can multiply through by T.

00:32:02.370 --> 00:32:07.740
So this T will get rid of this
T. I can bring a T, therefore,

00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:09.320
here.

00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:12.930
And this combination
over here I can

00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:21.510
replace from what I have there
with minus 3/2 f 3/2 plus of z

00:32:21.510 --> 00:32:24.226
divided by f 1/2 half plus of z.

00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:30.990
Why is any of this useful?

00:32:30.990 --> 00:32:35.340
Well, it immediately gives
the answer that I need.

00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:37.130
Why?

00:32:37.130 --> 00:32:44.290
Because f 1/2 is the
derivative of this function.

00:32:44.290 --> 00:32:46.590
And you can see that
I drew it so that it

00:32:46.590 --> 00:32:50.620
has infinite derivative
when z hits 1.

00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:55.930
And we had indeed said that
this function zeta of m, which

00:32:55.930 --> 00:32:59.640
is the limit of this
when z goes to 1,

00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:03.160
only exists for m
that is larger than 1,

00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:07.840
and it is divergent for
m that is less than 1.

00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:15.590
So when z hits 1, this
thing goes to infinity,

00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:18.720
and the fraction disappears.

00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:22.490
And so basically, the
additional correction

00:33:22.490 --> 00:33:26.680
that you have beyond this
becoming zeta of 5/2,

00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:30.290
which is what we have
over here, vanishes.

00:33:30.290 --> 00:33:35.870
So I have shown that, indeed,
whatever this curve is doing,

00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:43.080
it will hit that point
exactly at Tc of n

00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:46.830
at the same height as the
low temperature curve.

00:33:46.830 --> 00:33:51.090
And you can do a certain
amount of work and algebra

00:33:51.090 --> 00:33:56.450
to show that it goes
there with a finite slope.

00:33:56.450 --> 00:33:59.020
So that's the shape
of the heat capacity

00:33:59.020 --> 00:34:02.317
curve for the
Bose-Einstein condensate.

00:34:02.317 --> 00:34:03.150
AUDIENCE: Professor?

00:34:03.150 --> 00:34:03.850
PROFESSOR: Yes?

00:34:03.850 --> 00:34:08.929
AUDIENCE: So it seems that
f 1/2 goes to infinity,

00:34:08.929 --> 00:34:10.967
but it's [? on ?] the
half, so it is half

00:34:10.967 --> 00:34:12.950
comes from the [INAUDIBLE] 3.

00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:13.449
So--

00:34:13.449 --> 00:34:14.240
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:16.850
AUDIENCE: --you have higher
dimensional system, then

00:34:16.850 --> 00:34:19.520
it seems that [INAUDIBLE] won't
vanish there. [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:22.739 --> 00:34:26.320
PROFESSOR: So if you have a
higher dimensional system,

00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:28.320
indeed the situation
would be different.

00:34:32.659 --> 00:34:36.170
And I guess the borderline
dimension would need to be--

00:34:36.170 --> 00:34:40.261
since this is a V
over 2 minus 1--

00:34:40.261 --> 00:34:41.909
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:41.909 --> 00:34:44.239
PROFESSOR: V over
2 minus 1 being 1,

00:34:44.239 --> 00:34:46.775
which is the borderline,
will give you a dc of 4.

00:34:46.775 --> 00:34:49.040
So something else
happens above 4.

00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:49.830
Yes?

00:34:49.830 --> 00:34:53.870
AUDIENCE: So it seems that
the nature of this phase

00:34:53.870 --> 00:34:56.400
transition, indeed it
changes with the dimension.

00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:57.400
PROFESSOR: Exactly, yes.

00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:59.014
The nature of this
phase transition

00:34:59.014 --> 00:35:00.138
does depend on [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:11.860
Good.

00:35:14.811 --> 00:35:15.310
OK?

00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:24.026
So we will come back to
this heat capacity curve

00:35:24.026 --> 00:35:27.120
a little bit later
because I want

00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:31.630
to now change directions
and not talk about

00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:37.650
Bose-Einstein condensation
anymore, but about a phenomena

00:35:37.650 --> 00:35:41.297
that is much more
miraculous in my view,

00:35:41.297 --> 00:35:42.380
and that is superfluidity.

00:35:55.590 --> 00:36:02.350
So the first thing that is
very interesting about helium

00:36:02.350 --> 00:36:05.110
is its phase diagram.

00:36:05.110 --> 00:36:11.460
So we are used to
drawing phase diagrams

00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:15.700
as a function of
pressure and temperature,

00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:21.020
which have a separation
between a liquid and a gas

00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:23.780
that terminates at
a critical point.

00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:29.780
So we have seen something
like this many times, where

00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:33.355
you have on the low
pressure/high temperature

00:36:33.355 --> 00:36:35.810
side a gas.

00:36:35.810 --> 00:36:39.186
On the higher pressure/lower
temperature side,

00:36:39.186 --> 00:36:41.170
you have a liquid.

00:36:41.170 --> 00:36:46.390
And they terminate, this line
of coexistence between the two

00:36:46.390 --> 00:36:48.690
of them, at a critical point.

00:36:48.690 --> 00:36:52.990
And for the case of
helium, the critical point

00:36:52.990 --> 00:36:57.660
occurs roughly at
5.2 degrees Kelvin

00:36:57.660 --> 00:36:59.570
and something like
2.6 atmospheres.

00:37:03.784 --> 00:37:04.750
OK?

00:37:04.750 --> 00:37:11.650
So far, nothing different from,
say, liquid water, for example,

00:37:11.650 --> 00:37:16.110
and steam, except that
for all other substances,

00:37:16.110 --> 00:37:19.140
when we cool it at the
low enough temperatures,

00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:24.140
we go past the triple point,
and then we have a solid phase.

00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:28.450
For the case of
helium, it stays liquid

00:37:28.450 --> 00:37:32.270
all the way down
to 0 temperature.

00:37:32.270 --> 00:37:34.990
If you put sufficiently
high pressure on it,

00:37:34.990 --> 00:37:37.300
ultimately it will
become a solid.

00:37:41.570 --> 00:37:45.570
But at normal pressures--
so this maximal pressure

00:37:45.570 --> 00:37:50.210
is something of the
order of 26 atmosphere.

00:37:50.210 --> 00:37:54.600
For pressures that are
less than 26 atmosphere,

00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:58.530
you can cool the liquid all
the way down to 0 temperature,

00:37:58.530 --> 00:38:02.100
and it stays happily a liquid.

00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:06.340
So let's think about
why that is the case.

00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:11.510
Well, why do things typically
become solids anyway?

00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:15.110
The reason is that if I
think about the interaction

00:38:15.110 --> 00:38:20.310
that I have between two objects,
two atoms and molecules,

00:38:20.310 --> 00:38:23.750
we have discussed
this in connection

00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:28.470
with condensation
before that what

00:38:28.470 --> 00:38:33.690
we have is that at
very large separations

00:38:33.690 --> 00:38:36.450
there is a van der
Waals' attraction.

00:38:36.450 --> 00:38:42.400
Typically, the dipole
moments of these atoms

00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:45.900
would be fluctuating, and the
fluctuations would somehow

00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:48.170
align them temporarily
in the manner

00:38:48.170 --> 00:38:51.220
that the energy can be reduced.

00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:55.625
At very short distances, the
electronic clouds will overlap,

00:38:55.625 --> 00:38:59.710
and so you would have
something such as this.

00:38:59.710 --> 00:39:04.590
And then, typically, you
will have the function that

00:39:04.590 --> 00:39:08.628
joins them and look
something like this.

00:39:08.628 --> 00:39:10.970
OK?

00:39:10.970 --> 00:39:15.380
And this is no different
for the case of helium.

00:39:15.380 --> 00:39:20.620
You have here essentially
a hard core appearing

00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:25.220
at the distance that is of
the order of 2.6 angstroms.

00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:28.240
There is a minimum that is
of the order of 3 angstroms.

00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:36.685
Now, the depth of this potential
is not very big for helium.

00:39:36.685 --> 00:39:43.270
It is only of the order
of, say, 9 degrees Kelvin.

00:39:43.270 --> 00:39:49.930
And the reason is that the
strength of this van der Waals'

00:39:49.930 --> 00:39:54.700
attraction is proportional
to the polarizability that

00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:57.310
scales typically with
the number of electrons

00:39:57.310 --> 00:39:59.080
that you have in your atom.

00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:01.730
And so it is, in
fact, proportional

00:40:01.730 --> 00:40:06.010
to your atomic number squared.

00:40:06.010 --> 00:40:10.140
And with the
exception of hydrogen,

00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:13.000
this is going to be
the smallest value

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:16.360
that you are going to get for
the van der Waals' attraction.

00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:21.070
And hydrogen does not count
because it forms a molecule.

00:40:21.070 --> 00:40:24.890
So helium does not
form a molecule.

00:40:24.890 --> 00:40:27.685
You have these [? balls. ?]
They have these attractions.

00:40:27.685 --> 00:40:30.020
Now, typically
things become solid

00:40:30.020 --> 00:40:32.750
as you go to 0
temperature is because you

00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:36.130
can find the minimum energy
in which you put everybody

00:40:36.130 --> 00:40:39.240
at the minimum
energy separation.

00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:40.450
So you form a lattice.

00:40:40.450 --> 00:40:43.430
Everybody is around
this separation,

00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:47.680
and they're all happy and that
solid minimizes the energy.

00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:52.530
So why doesn't helium
do the same thing?

00:40:52.530 --> 00:40:55.200
Maybe it should just do
it at a lower temperature

00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:57.680
because the scale
of this is lower.

00:40:57.680 --> 00:40:59.350
Again, the reason
it doesn't do that

00:40:59.350 --> 00:41:02.070
is because of quantum mechanics.

00:41:02.070 --> 00:41:05.510
Because you can
say that, really,

00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:11.200
I cannot specify exactly where
the particle are because that

00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:13.550
would violate quantum mechanics.

00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:16.650
There has to be some
uncertainty delta x.

00:41:19.590 --> 00:41:22.380
And associated
with delta x there

00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:25.950
is going to be some kind of
a typical momentum, which

00:41:25.950 --> 00:41:28.490
is h bar over delta x.

00:41:28.490 --> 00:41:32.240
And there will be
some contribution

00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:35.230
to the kinetic
energy of particles

00:41:35.230 --> 00:41:41.140
due to this uncertainty in
delta x that is of this form.

00:41:41.140 --> 00:41:47.540
And if I make the
localization more precise,

00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:51.910
I have to pay a higher
cost in kinetic energy.

00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:54.940
Well, presumably the
scale of the energies

00:41:54.940 --> 00:41:59.960
that I can tolerate and still
keep these things localized

00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:08.780
is of the order of this
binding energy, which

00:42:08.780 --> 00:42:13.980
is of the order of, as we
said, 9 or 10 degrees Kelvin.

00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:16.263
Let's say 10 degrees Kelvin.

00:42:16.263 --> 00:42:16.763
OK?

00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:24.260
Now, the other property
that distinguishes helium

00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:29.870
from krypton and, let's say,
all the other noble gases

00:42:29.870 --> 00:42:33.370
is that its mass is very small.

00:42:33.370 --> 00:42:37.880
So because this mass is small,
this uncertainty in energy

00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:40.346
becomes comparatively larger.

00:42:40.346 --> 00:42:41.260
OK?

00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:44.590
And so if you put the
mass of the helium here

00:42:44.590 --> 00:42:48.450
and you use this
value of 10 degrees

00:42:48.450 --> 00:42:51.600
K converted to the
appropriate energy units,

00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:55.280
you ask what kind
of a delta x would

00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:58.090
be compatible with this
kind of binding energy,

00:42:58.090 --> 00:43:00.230
you find that the
delta x that you get

00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:08.140
is of the order
of 0.5 angstroms.

00:43:08.140 --> 00:43:09.630
OK?

00:43:09.630 --> 00:43:13.470
So basically, you cannot
keep this in the bottom

00:43:13.470 --> 00:43:17.410
of the potential if you have
uncertainty that is of this

00:43:17.410 --> 00:43:19.330
order.

00:43:19.330 --> 00:43:27.220
So the atoms of helium cannot
form a nice lattice and stay

00:43:27.220 --> 00:43:32.500
in order because that registry
would violate the quantum

00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:33.860
uncertainty principle.

00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:35.350
They are moving around.

00:43:35.350 --> 00:43:37.860
And so you have
a system that has

00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:41.790
been [? melted ?] due
to quantum fluctuations

00:43:41.790 --> 00:43:45.050
rather than thermal
fluctuations.

00:43:45.050 --> 00:43:47.060
OK?

00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:52.500
So that's all nice,
except that something

00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:56.370
does happen when
you cool helium.

00:43:56.370 --> 00:44:00.870
And actually, it is interesting
that helium provides us

00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:05.060
not only with one liquid that
persists all the way to 0

00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:09.480
temperature, but two
liquids because helium

00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:10.370
has two isotopes.

00:44:14.978 --> 00:44:19.010
There is helium-4, which
is the abundant one,

00:44:19.010 --> 00:44:27.304
and there is helium-3, which is
a much less available isotope.

00:44:27.304 --> 00:44:31.470
But the number of
protons being different

00:44:31.470 --> 00:44:37.290
in the nucleus of these means
that helium-4 is a boson,

00:44:37.290 --> 00:44:38.870
while helium-3 is fermion.

00:44:42.730 --> 00:44:47.450
So we have the opportunity to
observe both a Bose system that

00:44:47.450 --> 00:44:50.260
is liquid at low
temperature and a Fermi

00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:53.210
liquid at [INAUDIBLE]
temperatures.

00:44:53.210 --> 00:44:55.380
Now, the case of
the Fermi liquid

00:44:55.380 --> 00:44:59.180
is not really that
different in principle

00:44:59.180 --> 00:45:02.065
from the Fermi liquid of
the electrons in copper

00:45:02.065 --> 00:45:03.630
that we already discussed.

00:45:03.630 --> 00:45:05.910
There are some subtleties.

00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:09.780
In the case of the
bosons, [? well, ?]

00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:12.660
we saw that for bosons
there is potentially

00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:15.970
this kind of phase transition.

00:45:15.970 --> 00:45:21.640
In reality, what
happens is that helium

00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:25.090
has a transition
between two forms

00:45:25.090 --> 00:45:27.900
of the liquid at
a temperature that

00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:32.870
is of the order of
2.18 degrees Kelvin.

00:45:32.870 --> 00:45:39.795
So we can call this helium
I and this helium II,

00:45:39.795 --> 00:45:46.990
OK, two different forms of the
helium-4 liquid that you have.

00:45:46.990 --> 00:45:50.473
So how was this
seen experimentally?

00:46:00.630 --> 00:46:04.410
I kind of told you how
in these experiments

00:46:04.410 --> 00:46:07.110
of the Bose-Einstein
condensation,

00:46:07.110 --> 00:46:10.510
part of the way that
they cooled the system

00:46:10.510 --> 00:46:14.530
was to remove the
high-energy particles,

00:46:14.530 --> 00:46:17.300
and the remaining
particles cooled down.

00:46:17.300 --> 00:46:20.810
So that's the common
method that actually people

00:46:20.810 --> 00:46:22.720
use for cooling various things.

00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:28.890
It's called evaporative--
evaporative cooling.

00:46:33.450 --> 00:46:38.285
And for the case of helium, it
is actually reasonably simple

00:46:38.285 --> 00:46:39.720
to draw what it is.

00:46:42.690 --> 00:46:53.890
You have a bath that is full
of helium that is reasonably

00:46:53.890 --> 00:46:59.000
nicely thermally isolated
from the environment.

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:03.560
So you want to cool it,
remove the energy from it.

00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:10.760
And the thing that you do
is you pump out the gas.

00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:13.240
OK?

00:47:13.240 --> 00:47:22.670
So this is a coexistence
because this part

00:47:22.670 --> 00:47:26.760
up here on top of the
liquid helium is not vacuum.

00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:34.050
What happens is that there
is evaporation of helium,

00:47:34.050 --> 00:47:38.600
leaving the liquid and
going into the gas.

00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:43.350
And once they are in the
gas, they are pumped out.

00:47:43.350 --> 00:47:47.520
But every time you
grab a helium from here

00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:51.530
to put it into the gas,
you've essentially taken it

00:47:51.530 --> 00:47:55.780
from down here and
moved it to infinity,

00:47:55.780 --> 00:47:59.460
so you lose this amount
of binding energy.

00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:02.020
It's called latent heat.

00:48:02.020 --> 00:48:04.840
Essentially, this
is the latent heat,

00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:08.440
and it is actually of
the order of 7 degrees

00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:10.890
Kelvin because
typically it has to be

00:48:10.890 --> 00:48:14.750
the depth of the typical
positions of these particles.

00:48:14.750 --> 00:48:15.510
OK?

00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:20.080
So for each atom
that you pump out,

00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:22.880
you have reduced
the total energy

00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:27.040
that you have in the liquid,
and the liquid cools down.

00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:29.500
And what is the trajectory?

00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:34.810
You always actually remain
on this coexistence line.

00:48:34.810 --> 00:48:36.140
The pressure is changing.

00:48:36.140 --> 00:48:37.670
The temperature is lowering.

00:48:37.670 --> 00:48:40.840
But you're always remaining
on the coexistence

00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:44.220
of the gas and liquid line.

00:48:44.220 --> 00:48:47.880
So you follow what is
happening over here,

00:48:47.880 --> 00:48:51.560
and you find that as you
are approaching here,

00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:57.320
suddenly this system
starts to bubble up.

00:48:57.320 --> 00:49:02.670
It is just like having a
kettle that is boiling.

00:49:02.670 --> 00:49:05.860
Indeed, it is, again, in
like the case of kettle,

00:49:05.860 --> 00:49:09.650
there are these bubbles that
are carrying the steam that

00:49:09.650 --> 00:49:12.140
is going to go over here
and being pulled out,

00:49:12.140 --> 00:49:14.480
and so it is bubbling.

00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:19.100
And then suddenly, [INAUDIBLE]
heat 2.18 degrees Kelvin,

00:49:19.100 --> 00:49:22.680
and the whole thing quiets down.

00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:26.242
And below that, it stays quiet.

00:49:26.242 --> 00:49:28.830
And so let's see if
we can show that.

00:49:40.031 --> 00:49:41.760
We saw the phase diagram.

00:49:52.810 --> 00:49:54.605
So this is the liquid.

00:49:57.385 --> 00:49:59.486
Let's see if we can
get the sound also.

00:49:59.486 --> 00:50:00.152
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

-[INAUDIBLE].

00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:04.396
This rapid [INAUDIBLE]
evaporates [INAUDIBLE]

00:50:04.396 --> 00:50:08.300
helium cools, until at 2
degrees above absolute 0,

00:50:08.300 --> 00:50:10.672
a dramatic transformation
takes place.

00:50:13.636 --> 00:50:14.624
Suddenly, we see--

00:50:14.972 --> 00:50:16.180
PROFESSOR: Everything quiets.

00:50:16.180 --> 00:50:19.391
--[INAUDIBLE] stops and that the
surface of the liquid helium is

00:50:19.391 --> 00:50:21.194
completely still.

00:50:21.194 --> 00:50:23.652
The temperature is actually
being lowered even further now,

00:50:23.652 --> 00:50:25.460
but nothing is happening.

00:50:25.460 --> 00:50:28.582
Well, this is really one
of the great phenomenon

00:50:28.582 --> 00:50:31.827
in 20th-century physics.

00:50:31.827 --> 00:50:32.410
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:50:32.410 --> 00:50:38.695
I'll show you this movie
at the next lecture.

00:50:41.220 --> 00:50:43.970
But this is just a
segment of it that

00:50:43.970 --> 00:50:50.040
shows the important property
of this fluid, helium II, which

00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:51.270
is the superfluid.

00:50:51.270 --> 00:50:54.850
So now you're above the
temperature it was boiling,

00:50:54.850 --> 00:50:56.560
but it quieted down.

00:50:56.560 --> 00:50:58.600
You can see that
the fluid started

00:50:58.600 --> 00:51:01.390
to go through the
capillaries that

00:51:01.390 --> 00:51:03.460
were at the bottom of this.

00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:07.510
So at the bottom of this glass
there were fine capillaries.

00:51:07.510 --> 00:51:11.380
As long as you were up
here, the capillaries

00:51:11.380 --> 00:51:14.690
were sufficient to
keep the fluid above.

00:51:14.690 --> 00:51:18.370
Once you went below,
the fluid went through

00:51:18.370 --> 00:51:21.060
as if there is no resistance.

00:51:21.060 --> 00:51:25.690
And that's the
superfluid property.

00:51:25.690 --> 00:51:28.331

superconductivity were baffling

[END PLAYBACK]

00:51:30.239 --> 00:51:34.010
PROFESSOR: OK, we'll
go back to that later.

00:51:34.010 --> 00:51:38.090
So let's list some
of the properties

00:51:38.090 --> 00:51:41.705
of this superfluid state.

00:52:03.020 --> 00:52:04.850
OK.

00:52:04.850 --> 00:52:12.140
So what this last
experiment showed

00:52:12.140 --> 00:52:16.175
is that it appears to
have zero viscosity.

00:52:21.350 --> 00:52:24.940
So what's the way that
you would calculate

00:52:24.940 --> 00:52:27.770
the viscosity of a fluid?

00:52:27.770 --> 00:52:35.660
And one way to sort
of do that relies on

00:52:35.660 --> 00:52:41.550
like what we had over
here, passing the fluid

00:52:41.550 --> 00:52:44.720
through some pore or capillary.

00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:46.500
In the case of this
experiment, you

00:52:46.500 --> 00:52:50.500
have to really make this
capillary extremely fine

00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:53.990
so that practically
nothing will go through it.

00:52:53.990 --> 00:52:55.770
But this could be
a quite general way

00:52:55.770 --> 00:53:01.120
of measuring viscosity
of some fluid.

00:53:01.120 --> 00:53:04.710
So you have some fluid.

00:53:04.710 --> 00:53:09.330
You can measure its
viscosity by trying

00:53:09.330 --> 00:53:14.650
to pass it through a
capillary by exerting pressure

00:53:14.650 --> 00:53:19.580
on one side and measuring,
in essence, the difference

00:53:19.580 --> 00:53:23.340
between the two pressures
that you have on the two sides

00:53:23.340 --> 00:53:27.005
as a measure of the force
that you are exerting on this.

00:53:27.005 --> 00:53:30.790
And once you do that,
then these pistons enhance

00:53:30.790 --> 00:53:33.660
the velocity--
sorry, the fluid, are

00:53:33.660 --> 00:53:37.430
moving through with
some kind of velocity.

00:53:37.430 --> 00:53:43.100
And some measure of
viscosity, after you

00:53:43.100 --> 00:53:46.780
divide by various things that
have dimensions of length

00:53:46.780 --> 00:53:49.980
and pressure, et
cetera, would be related

00:53:49.980 --> 00:53:54.275
to the velocity
divided by delta P--

00:53:54.275 --> 00:53:58.470
is to achieve the same velocity,
how much pressure difference

00:53:58.470 --> 00:54:00.990
you have to put.

00:54:00.990 --> 00:54:05.680
Now, for this experiment
of superfluid helium,

00:54:05.680 --> 00:54:10.500
you'll find that essentially
you can get a finite velocity

00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:14.240
by typically infinitesimal
pressure difference.

00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:19.520
So when you try to use this
method to calculate viscosity,

00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:24.210
you find that, to whatever
precision you can measure,

00:54:24.210 --> 00:54:28.130
essentially this value of eta
is not distinguishable from 0.

00:54:30.660 --> 00:54:31.670
OK?

00:54:31.670 --> 00:54:32.521
Yes?

00:54:32.521 --> 00:54:36.369
AUDIENCE: The way you defined
it, it would be infinity?

00:54:36.369 --> 00:54:39.480
PROFESSOR: Then I
probably defined it--

00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:47.730
[? no? ?] Delta P goes to 0 for
a finite V. Yes, so viscosity--

00:54:47.730 --> 00:54:49.230
AUDIENCE: So what
you're essentially

00:54:49.230 --> 00:54:51.194
writing is the
Reynolds number, yeah?

00:54:51.194 --> 00:54:52.126
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:54:52.126 --> 00:54:52.667
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:55:02.500 --> 00:55:04.820
PROFESSOR: All right?

00:55:04.820 --> 00:55:07.460
But there is another
experiment that

00:55:07.460 --> 00:55:16.050
appears to indicate that
there is a finite viscosity,

00:55:16.050 --> 00:55:20.070
and that is a famous experiment
due to Andronikashvili.

00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:31.815
And basically, this is
the other experiment.

00:55:31.815 --> 00:55:40.950
You imagine that you put your
fluid inside a container.

00:55:40.950 --> 00:55:49.320
And then you insert in this
container a set of plates,

00:55:49.320 --> 00:55:52.670
could be copper plates
or something else,

00:55:52.670 --> 00:55:54.900
that are stacked on
top of each other.

00:55:59.076 --> 00:56:06.366
So essentially, you have a
stack of these plates that

00:56:06.366 --> 00:56:11.730
have a common axis,
and there's a rod

00:56:11.730 --> 00:56:14.870
that is going through them.

00:56:14.870 --> 00:56:24.930
And what you created here
is a torsional oscillator

00:56:24.930 --> 00:56:30.220
in the sense that this rod
that holds all of these things

00:56:30.220 --> 00:56:35.780
together has a particular
preferred orientation.

00:56:35.780 --> 00:56:45.670
And if you start, let's
say-- well, it may or may not

00:56:45.670 --> 00:56:55.290
have a particular orientation--
but if you start to rotate it,

00:56:55.290 --> 00:57:00.050
it will certainly have
a moment of inertia that

00:57:00.050 --> 00:57:08.830
resists the rotation that is
coming from all of the plates

00:57:08.830 --> 00:57:11.550
if it was in vacuum.

00:57:11.550 --> 00:57:15.900
So if I could measure the moment
of inertia of these objects,

00:57:15.900 --> 00:57:19.800
either through torsion
or some other mechanism,

00:57:19.800 --> 00:57:21.840
if it is a torsional
oscillator I

00:57:21.840 --> 00:57:24.530
could figure out what
the frequency is.

00:57:24.530 --> 00:57:27.000
If I knew the
[? spinning ?] constant

00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:30.920
that wants to bring the angle
to some particular value,

00:57:30.920 --> 00:57:33.600
I would divide that by
the moment of inertia.

00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:36.400
The square root of that
would give me the frequency.

00:57:36.400 --> 00:57:40.390
So the frequency is a measure
of the moment of inertia.

00:57:40.390 --> 00:57:42.380
So if I had this
thing in vacuum,

00:57:42.380 --> 00:57:44.050
I could figure out
what the moment

00:57:44.050 --> 00:57:47.310
of inertia of all
of the plates was.

00:57:47.310 --> 00:57:55.340
Now, if I add the fluid to this,
then as I start to rotate this,

00:57:55.340 --> 00:57:59.480
some of the fluid will
certainly move with the plates.

00:57:59.480 --> 00:58:02.120
And so the moment of inertia
that you would measure

00:58:02.120 --> 00:58:04.840
in the presence of
the fluid is larger

00:58:04.840 --> 00:58:07.920
than it is in the
absence of fluid.

00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:11.500
And that additional
moment of inertia

00:58:11.500 --> 00:58:15.270
tells you about how much of
the fluid is, in some sense,

00:58:15.270 --> 00:58:19.200
stuck to the plates, and that's
another different measure

00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:21.650
of the viscosity.

00:58:21.650 --> 00:58:22.890
OK?

00:58:22.890 --> 00:58:29.560
So if we sort of look
at this experiment,

00:58:29.560 --> 00:58:36.200
we would imagine that if I
measure the moment of inertia

00:58:36.200 --> 00:58:44.130
as a function of
temperature, something

00:58:44.130 --> 00:58:47.770
should happen when I hit Tc.

00:58:47.770 --> 00:58:54.420
Above Tc, I'm getting some value
that is measuring, essentially,

00:58:54.420 --> 00:58:58.470
the moment of inertia of
the plates plus the fluid

00:58:58.470 --> 00:59:01.580
that is moving
around, [? we do. ?]

00:59:01.580 --> 00:59:05.400
But what happens
when you hit Tc?

00:59:05.400 --> 00:59:11.050
If the superfluid doesn't
care about things around it,

00:59:11.050 --> 00:59:14.020
you would imagine that this
would drop down to the value

00:59:14.020 --> 00:59:17.270
that it has in vacuum.

00:59:17.270 --> 00:59:20.350
In reality, what it does
is something like this.

00:59:23.090 --> 00:59:26.170
So it does go to
the value that you

00:59:26.170 --> 00:59:31.750
would have in vacuum but
only at 0 temperature.

00:59:31.750 --> 00:59:38.280
So at any finite
temperature we know Tc.

00:59:38.280 --> 00:59:44.220
There is indeed some
fraction of the superfluid

00:59:44.220 --> 00:59:48.660
that is trapped by these plates.

00:59:48.660 --> 00:59:50.472
So what's happening?

00:59:50.472 --> 00:59:52.600
OK, so this is one [INAUDIBLE].

00:59:56.150 --> 01:00:02.330
The other property-- maybe I
will squeeze it somewhere here.

01:00:27.590 --> 01:00:30.230
There are a whole
bunch of things

01:00:30.230 --> 01:00:35.150
that indicate that there is a
coupling between temperature

01:00:35.150 --> 01:00:42.471
and mechanical properties,
so-called thermo-mechanical

01:00:42.471 --> 01:00:42.970
couplings.

01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:57.990
What you find in this
experiment, where

01:00:57.990 --> 01:01:01.730
the fluid spontaneously
goes, let's

01:01:01.730 --> 01:01:05.620
say, from this
side to this side,

01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:09.080
so the direction
is like this, is

01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:11.680
that when you measure
the temperatures

01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:13.890
you will find that the
temperature of this one

01:01:13.890 --> 01:01:19.540
goes up, and the temperature
of this one goes down.

01:01:19.540 --> 01:01:28.380
So somehow the motion led to
some temperature differences.

01:01:28.380 --> 01:01:31.830
A dramatic one that, again,
maybe we'll show in the movie

01:01:31.830 --> 01:01:34.540
next time is the
fountain effect.

01:01:38.540 --> 01:01:42.300
What you do is you--
let's imagine that,

01:01:42.300 --> 01:01:49.010
again, you have a vat of
helium, and inside of it

01:01:49.010 --> 01:01:55.010
you put a tube that is,
let's say, shaped like this.

01:01:55.010 --> 01:02:03.930
And you have the fluid that
is occupying everything here.

01:02:03.930 --> 01:02:10.160
Then inside this tube,
you put some material

01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:13.280
that is a good absorber of
heat, such as, let's say,

01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:18.770
a piece of carbon, and
then you shine laser

01:02:18.770 --> 01:02:24.380
on it so that this
thing becomes hot.

01:02:24.380 --> 01:02:28.380
So in this case, the
temperature goes up,

01:02:28.380 --> 01:02:34.740
and what you find happens
is that the fluid will

01:02:34.740 --> 01:02:37.500
start to shoot up
here like a fountain.

01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:40.270
It's called the fountain
effect because of that.

01:02:40.270 --> 01:02:45.640
And essentially, whereas
here pressure was converted

01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:50.130
to temperature, here
temperature, the heating,

01:02:50.130 --> 01:02:52.460
gets converted to pressure.

01:02:52.460 --> 01:02:54.440
So this is like-- I
don't know if you've ever

01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:57.610
done this, where you put
your hand under water,

01:02:57.610 --> 01:03:01.160
and if you squeeze your hand
and the water shoots up.

01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:05.080
So it's kind of putting pressure
here, causing a fountain that

01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:07.860
is shooting up like that.

01:03:07.860 --> 01:03:08.360
OK?

01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:13.890
So there is this coupling
between temperature

01:03:13.890 --> 01:03:19.000
and-- actually, this issue
of boiling-not boiling

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:22.910
is also a manifestation of a
coupling between temperature

01:03:22.910 --> 01:03:26.200
and mechanical properties, which
is whether the fluid is boiling

01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:28.160
or not boiling.

01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:30.470
OK?

01:03:30.470 --> 01:03:36.820
So given everything that we
have been talking about so far,

01:03:36.820 --> 01:03:40.755
it is tempting to
imagine that there

01:03:40.755 --> 01:03:44.600
is a connection
between all of this

01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:51.010
and the Bose-Einstein
condensation.

01:03:51.010 --> 01:03:52.010
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:03:52.010 --> 01:03:54.885
PROFESSOR: Yes?

01:03:54.885 --> 01:03:59.998
AUDIENCE: Do superfluids have
no vorticity or can they?

01:04:04.390 --> 01:04:06.710
PROFESSOR: Yes, they
can have vorticity,

01:04:06.710 --> 01:04:08.520
but it is of a special kind.

01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:11.210
It is quantized vorticity.

01:04:11.210 --> 01:04:16.950
And so what you can certainly do
is you can take a vat of helium

01:04:16.950 --> 01:04:20.040
and set it into
rotation, and then you

01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:23.679
will create vortex lines
inside this superfluid.

01:04:23.679 --> 01:04:24.220
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:04:24.220 --> 01:04:26.370
I was wondering if
there was an analogy

01:04:26.370 --> 01:04:30.280
to superconductivity
and magnetic fields.

01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:33.480
PROFESSOR: The analog of the
magnetic field is the rotation.

01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:34.195
AUDIENCE: Right.

01:04:34.195 --> 01:04:34.820
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:04:34.820 --> 01:04:35.361
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:04:35.361 --> 01:04:36.824
PROFESSOR: So in
that sense, yes.

01:04:40.993 --> 01:04:41.493
OK?

01:04:44.950 --> 01:04:47.130
OK.

01:04:47.130 --> 01:04:59.520
So similarities between BEC,
Bose-Einstein Condensation,

01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:00.780
and superfluidity.

01:05:11.130 --> 01:05:19.350
I would say that perhaps the
most important one, although I

01:05:19.350 --> 01:05:21.850
guess at the beginning of
the story they didn't know

01:05:21.850 --> 01:05:31.410
this one, is that helium-3,
which is a fermion,

01:05:31.410 --> 01:05:43.030
does not become superfluid
around this same temperature

01:05:43.030 --> 01:05:46.060
of 2 degrees Kelvin,
which is where

01:05:46.060 --> 01:05:47.570
helium-4 becomes superfluid.

01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:52.860
What is special about
this is, well, you

01:05:52.860 --> 01:06:00.990
would say that once you
have mass and density,

01:06:00.990 --> 01:06:04.660
you can figure out what the
Bose-Einstein temperature is.

01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:09.620
You had this formula
that was n lambda

01:06:09.620 --> 01:06:15.350
cubed is equal to zeta of 3/2.

01:06:15.350 --> 01:06:23.820
So that gives you some
value of kB Tc being h

01:06:23.820 --> 01:06:32.320
squared 2 pi mass of helium,
and then you have a zeta of 3/2

01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:33.520
and n somewhere.

01:06:36.390 --> 01:06:55.990
3-- I guess this n-- oops,
n-- yeah, it's correct-- n h

01:06:55.990 --> 01:07:05.510
cubed 2 pi m kB Tc to the
3/2 being zeta of 3/2.

01:07:05.510 --> 01:07:16.874
So 2 pi m kB Tc is
proportional to n zeta of 3/2

01:07:16.874 --> 01:07:19.530
to the 2/3 power.

01:07:19.530 --> 01:07:21.230
OK.

01:07:21.230 --> 01:07:28.570
So I had a picture here, which
was the typical attraction

01:07:28.570 --> 01:07:30.000
potential.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:33.330
The typical separation
of helium atoms

01:07:33.330 --> 01:07:36.700
is something like 3.6 angstroms.

01:07:36.700 --> 01:07:41.050
How do I know that is because
the density I can figure out

01:07:41.050 --> 01:07:45.390
is typically 1 over the
volume per particle,

01:07:45.390 --> 01:07:51.460
and this volume per particle
is roughly 3.6 angstroms cubed.

01:07:51.460 --> 01:07:55.050
It's something like
46.2 angstrom cubed.

01:07:55.050 --> 01:07:58.660
So I can put that
value of n over here.

01:07:58.660 --> 01:08:01.280
I know what the
mass of helium is.

01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:05.010
And I can figure
out what this Tc is,

01:08:05.010 --> 01:08:11.490
and I find that Tc is 3.13
degrees K. You say, well, it's

01:08:11.490 --> 01:08:17.970
not exactly the 2 pi and
something that we had.

01:08:17.970 --> 01:08:22.520
But given that we completely
ignored the interactions

01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:25.660
that we have between this,
and this is the result

01:08:25.660 --> 01:08:27.930
that we have for
[? point ?] particles

01:08:27.930 --> 01:08:32.319
of mass m with no interactions,
this is actually very good.

01:08:32.319 --> 01:08:35.660
You would say, OK, this is
roughly in the right range.

01:08:35.660 --> 01:08:38.340
And presumably if
I were to include

01:08:38.340 --> 01:08:42.620
the effects of
interactions, potentially I

01:08:42.620 --> 01:08:46.204
will get an interaction,
temperature,

01:08:46.204 --> 01:08:48.819
that is roughly correct.

01:08:48.819 --> 01:08:53.540
So this is another reason.

01:08:53.540 --> 01:09:00.430
The third reason is that
you have automatically,

01:09:00.430 --> 01:09:04.330
when you are talking about the
Bose-Einstein condensation,

01:09:04.330 --> 01:09:07.910
a relationship between
pressure and temperature.

01:09:07.910 --> 01:09:09.950
So remember the
formula that we had

01:09:09.950 --> 01:09:11.790
for the Bose-Einstein
condensation,

01:09:11.790 --> 01:09:16.189
beta P was something,
where P is kT

01:09:16.189 --> 01:09:22.470
1 over lambda cubed
zeta of 5/2, right?

01:09:22.470 --> 01:09:25.479
So once you specify
the temperature,

01:09:25.479 --> 01:09:28.970
you've also specified
the pressure.

01:09:28.970 --> 01:09:31.410
They go hand in hand.

01:09:31.410 --> 01:09:35.370
So then you can start to explain
a lot of these phenomena,

01:09:35.370 --> 01:09:39.109
such as here you
increase the temperature,

01:09:39.109 --> 01:09:42.359
pressure had to go up, and
it was the increased pressure

01:09:42.359 --> 01:09:43.569
than did that.

01:09:43.569 --> 01:09:46.304
It kind of tells you
something about what

01:09:46.304 --> 01:09:49.729
is going on in this
experiment over here,

01:09:49.729 --> 01:09:54.310
where the temperature goes up
where you have higher pressure.

01:09:54.310 --> 01:09:58.120
It actually also
explains why things

01:09:58.120 --> 01:10:02.250
stop bubbling when you
go into the superfluid.

01:10:02.250 --> 01:10:04.960
Because let's back
out and think of why

01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:09.515
things are bubbling when you put
your kettle on top of the oven.

01:10:09.515 --> 01:10:14.000
And the reason is that there
are variations in temperature.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:17.600
There could be a local
hotspot over here,

01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:20.770
and in this local
hotspot, eventually there

01:10:20.770 --> 01:10:25.580
will a bubble that forms,
and the bubble goes away.

01:10:25.580 --> 01:10:32.400
Why is it that it forms here
is because heat gets spread out

01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:34.370
through diffusion.

01:10:34.370 --> 01:10:40.180
If I strike a match or even
if I have a blow torch here,

01:10:40.180 --> 01:10:43.750
you won't feel the
heat for some time.

01:10:43.750 --> 01:10:49.410
But if I do this, you
hear my hand clapping

01:10:49.410 --> 01:10:51.060
much more rapidly.

01:10:51.060 --> 01:10:57.920
So pressure gets transmitted
very efficiently through sound,

01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:01.870
whereas heat goes very
slowly through diffusion.

01:11:01.870 --> 01:11:06.710
And that's why when you
boil something, essentially

01:11:06.710 --> 01:11:11.880
you will have the diffusion of
heat, local hotspots, bubbles.

01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:18.740
But if temperature changes are
connected to pressure changes,

01:11:18.740 --> 01:11:21.760
then for the superfluid,
having a local hotspot

01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:23.770
is like doing this.

01:11:23.770 --> 01:11:26.800
It creates immediately
a pressure change,

01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:29.926
and pressure changes
are rapidly taken away.

01:11:29.926 --> 01:11:33.380
And that's why this
could also explain

01:11:33.380 --> 01:11:34.610
what's going on over here.

01:11:38.370 --> 01:11:45.350
So I think this number two was
first noted by Fritz London.

01:11:45.350 --> 01:11:49.330
Maybe we'll talk about that
a bit more next time around.

01:11:49.330 --> 01:11:55.630
Based on all of
these similarities,

01:11:55.630 --> 01:12:02.200
Laszlo Tisza, who
spent many years at MIT

01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:08.100
after being in Europe,
proposed the two-fluid model.

01:12:14.390 --> 01:12:16.790
So again, roughly
inspired by what

01:12:16.790 --> 01:12:21.570
we saw for the case of the
Bose-Einstein condensate,

01:12:21.570 --> 01:12:23.950
we saw that for the
Bose-Einstein condensate,

01:12:23.950 --> 01:12:27.940
below Tc you had to
make a separation

01:12:27.940 --> 01:12:33.970
for the number of things that
were in the ground state,

01:12:33.970 --> 01:12:37.280
k equals to 0, and
all of the others

01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:40.180
that were in the
higher excited states.

01:12:40.180 --> 01:12:44.130
Pressure, heat
capacity, everything

01:12:44.130 --> 01:12:48.950
came from the excited component,
whereas the component that

01:12:48.950 --> 01:12:53.230
was at the k equals to 0 state
was not making any contribution

01:12:53.230 --> 01:12:55.300
to these phenomena.

01:12:55.300 --> 01:12:58.860
So what he proposed
was that somehow,

01:12:58.860 --> 01:13:03.870
again, similarly when you
are in the superfluid,

01:13:03.870 --> 01:13:06.670
you really have two
components, two fluids

01:13:06.670 --> 01:13:08.790
that are in coexistence.

01:13:08.790 --> 01:13:11.800
There is a superfluid
component, and there

01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:15.130
is a normal component.

01:13:15.130 --> 01:13:22.030
And as you change temperature,
these two components

01:13:22.030 --> 01:13:24.570
get converted to each other.

01:13:24.570 --> 01:13:28.000
So just like the case of the
Bose-Einstein condensate,

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:31.800
it is not like you have
so many of this fluid, so

01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:33.460
many of that fluid.

01:13:33.460 --> 01:13:37.170
These two things are
always interchanging.

01:13:37.170 --> 01:13:40.920
And then what is happening
in this experiment,

01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:45.600
presumably, is that the
superfluid component

01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:50.450
goes through, the normal
component leaves behind.

01:13:50.450 --> 01:13:54.140
The superfluid component is the
component that, in some sense,

01:13:54.140 --> 01:13:57.550
has less entropy, is
at lower temperature.

01:13:57.550 --> 01:14:00.990
So when it goes here,
it cools down this part.

01:14:00.990 --> 01:14:04.890
This part then goes
up in temperature.

01:14:04.890 --> 01:14:09.900
Again, there is no way that you
can push all of the superfluid

01:14:09.900 --> 01:14:13.410
here and have normal here
because these things get

01:14:13.410 --> 01:14:14.040
converted.

01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:17.520
So some amount of superfluid
goes through here.

01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:20.160
Some amount gets converted
from the normal back

01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:21.000
to the superfluid.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:24.120
So there is this exchange
that is constantly

01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:26.170
taking place in the system.

01:14:26.170 --> 01:14:32.260
And so on the basis of
this model and having

01:14:32.260 --> 01:14:36.070
different velocities for
the normal and superfluid

01:14:36.070 --> 01:14:41.940
component, Tisza could explain
a number of these things.

01:14:41.940 --> 01:14:44.750
OK?

01:14:44.750 --> 01:14:59.240
So I will mention some
important differences

01:14:59.240 --> 01:15:03.750
at the end of this lecture
and leave their resolution

01:15:03.750 --> 01:15:05.030
for next.

01:15:05.030 --> 01:15:10.470
So while those were similarities
between BEC and superfluidity,

01:15:10.470 --> 01:15:12.280
there are very
important differences.

01:15:31.780 --> 01:15:36.080
One important
observation immediately

01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:46.880
is that if I try to compress
superfluid helium or normal

01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:48.230
helium, it doesn't matter.

01:15:48.230 --> 01:15:50.810
It is just like
trying to compress

01:15:50.810 --> 01:15:53.222
any other fluid such as water.

01:15:53.222 --> 01:15:58.300
It does not like to be squeezed.

01:15:58.300 --> 01:16:05.900
So helium liquid is
approximately, of course

01:16:05.900 --> 01:16:20.710
not entirely,
incompressible, while BEC, we

01:16:20.710 --> 01:16:24.770
saw that the pressure is only
a function of temperature.

01:16:24.770 --> 01:16:28.020
It doesn't know anything
about the density.

01:16:28.020 --> 01:16:35.610
So you can change the density.

01:16:35.610 --> 01:16:37.870
All of the additional
particles will

01:16:37.870 --> 01:16:39.740
go to go to the k
equals to 0 state.

01:16:39.740 --> 01:16:41.780
It doesn't really care.

01:16:41.780 --> 01:16:44.110
So BEC is infinitely
compressible.

01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:54.490
And of course,
this is immediately

01:16:54.490 --> 01:16:56.830
a manifestation of
the interactions.

01:17:00.990 --> 01:17:04.880
In the case of the BEC, we
didn't put any interactions

01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:05.920
among the particles.

01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:09.840
We can put as many of them as
we like into the single state k

01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:11.210
equals to 0.

01:17:11.210 --> 01:17:14.370
Of course, real heliums,
they have the self-avoiding--

01:17:14.370 --> 01:17:16.464
the interaction between them.

01:17:16.464 --> 01:17:18.130
They cannot go
[? through ?] each other.

01:17:18.130 --> 01:17:20.760
So that's an
important difference.

01:17:24.830 --> 01:17:41.400
Number 2 is that detailed
shapes/ T dependences of heat

01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:47.970
capacity and density of the
superfluid part are different.

01:17:51.260 --> 01:17:53.150
OK.

01:17:53.150 --> 01:17:58.640
So I have up there what
the heat capacity of a BEC

01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:01.100
should look like.

01:18:01.100 --> 01:18:07.720
Now, people have measured
the heat capacity of helium

01:18:07.720 --> 01:18:12.410
as a function of temperature,
and something does indeed

01:18:12.410 --> 01:18:16.350
happen at Tc.

01:18:16.350 --> 01:18:21.310
And what you find the shape
is is something like this.

01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:33.300
It goes to 0, and then it
does something like this.

01:18:33.300 --> 01:18:37.780
And so while it doesn't look
that different from what

01:18:37.780 --> 01:18:42.400
I have up there, except that
when you look at the behavior

01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:45.770
down here, at the
transition, over there

01:18:45.770 --> 01:18:47.790
it went to a finite value.

01:18:47.790 --> 01:18:49.995
Here it diverges as a log.

01:18:56.700 --> 01:19:01.460
So when you go to Tc, it
actually goes to infinity.

01:19:01.460 --> 01:19:03.760
And because of the
shape that this has,

01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:06.130
this is sometimes called
the lambda transition.

01:19:12.760 --> 01:19:17.560
Now, there's lots of issues
about interesting things

01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:20.090
happening at the
transition, and we

01:19:20.090 --> 01:19:23.050
won't be able to resolve that.

01:19:23.050 --> 01:19:25.910
But one thing that we should
be able to figure out,

01:19:25.910 --> 01:19:29.150
based on what we know
already, is the behavior

01:19:29.150 --> 01:19:31.900
as things go to 0 temperature.

01:19:31.900 --> 01:19:34.950
And I said that for the
Bose-Einstein condensate,

01:19:34.950 --> 01:19:38.680
the temperature dependence
is T to the 3/2.

01:19:38.680 --> 01:19:43.050
What is important is
that for the superfluid,

01:19:43.050 --> 01:19:45.750
it is actually
proportional to T cubed.

01:19:50.020 --> 01:19:53.930
And T cubed, if you
go back in the course,

01:19:53.930 --> 01:19:57.890
is a signature of what
was happening for phonons.

01:19:57.890 --> 01:19:59.860
So Landau looked
at this and said

01:19:59.860 --> 01:20:03.430
there must be some kind of a
phonon-like excitation going

01:20:03.430 --> 01:20:09.085
on, which is different from this
case [INAUDIBLE] excitations

01:20:09.085 --> 01:20:12.710
that we have.

01:20:12.710 --> 01:20:17.000
The other thing that
we had was that if we

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:23.560
look at the fraction that is
in-- let's say the density that

01:20:23.560 --> 01:20:30.910
is in the k equals to 0 state as
a function of temperature, what

01:20:30.910 --> 01:20:38.850
happens for the
superfluid-- sorry,

01:20:38.850 --> 01:20:41.370
what happens for the
Bose-Einstein condensate--

01:20:41.370 --> 01:20:43.110
for the Bose-Einstein
condensate,

01:20:43.110 --> 01:20:47.250
let's use the
green-- essentially,

01:20:47.250 --> 01:20:56.380
the curve will come down to Tc
linearly, and then it goes up,

01:20:56.380 --> 01:21:01.580
and it reaches its
asymptotic value.

01:21:01.580 --> 01:21:06.050
From this result, the
fraction that is excited,

01:21:06.050 --> 01:21:09.130
the difference to 1
is proportional to 1

01:21:09.130 --> 01:21:10.130
over lambda cubed.

01:21:10.130 --> 01:21:12.060
So this goes like T to the 3/2.

01:21:16.100 --> 01:21:20.820
You can ask whether what was
observed in the Andronikashvili

01:21:20.820 --> 01:21:24.870
experiment, eventually
this measure

01:21:24.870 --> 01:21:29.930
also, the fraction that is
in the superfluid component

01:21:29.930 --> 01:21:34.290
or excited states, does
this curve match that curve?

01:21:34.290 --> 01:21:38.350
But if I take this curve and
put it over here, first of all,

01:21:38.350 --> 01:21:40.770
down here it is different.

01:21:40.770 --> 01:21:45.980
It goes like Tc minus T to the
2/3 power rather than linear

01:21:45.980 --> 01:21:48.600
that you have over here.

01:21:48.600 --> 01:21:50.790
That, again, is less
[? worry ?] than the fact

01:21:50.790 --> 01:21:54.265
that over here it goes
to 0 proportional to T

01:21:54.265 --> 01:21:56.380
to the fourth.

01:21:56.380 --> 01:21:58.564
Again, something that
needs explanation.

01:22:03.410 --> 01:22:07.500
And finally, I will
write down one statement,

01:22:07.500 --> 01:22:11.130
and then maybe we'll
explain next time,

01:22:11.130 --> 01:22:20.800
is that BEC with the
spectrum of excitations,

01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:29.020
which is k squared over
2m, cannot be superfluid.

01:22:32.020 --> 01:22:38.592
There is an interesting reason
for that that we will explain.

01:22:38.592 --> 01:22:43.190
And indeed, we'll see
that having excitations

01:22:43.190 --> 01:22:47.180
that are [INAUDIBLE] like is
compatible with superfluidity.

01:22:47.180 --> 01:22:49.890
This kind of excitation is not.

01:22:49.890 --> 01:22:55.100
So why is that, et cetera,
we'll talk about next time.
