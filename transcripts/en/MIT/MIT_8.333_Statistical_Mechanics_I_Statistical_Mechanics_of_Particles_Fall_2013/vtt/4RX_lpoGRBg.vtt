00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.150
PROFESSOR: This is 8.333
Statistical Mechanics.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.530
And I'll start by telling you
a little bit about the syllabus

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:32.970
before going through the
structure of the course.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.120
So what I have written
here is a, kind of,

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:45.660
rough definition of statistical
mechanics from my perspective.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.320
And the syllabus
is a guide to how

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.480
we are going to
approach this object.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.270
So let's take a look at
the syllabus over there.

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.100
So the first thing that
you're going to focus on

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.620
is, what is it that
you're trying to describe?

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.960
And these are the
equilibrium properties

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.120
that are described
best through what

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.040
I've been doing
section one, which

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.960
has to do with thermodynamics.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.430
You'll start today
with thermodynamics.

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.700
Basically, it's a
phenomenological approach,

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.630
so you essentially
look at something,

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.070
as kind of a black
box, without knowing

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.160
what the ingredients
are, and try

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:32.560
to give some kind of
description of how it's

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.600
function and properties change.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.710
And these can be captured, for
the case of thermal properties

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.760
of matter through the laws of
thermodynamics, which we will

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.740
set out in this first section,
which will roughly take us

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.560
the first four
lectures of the course.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.270
Then I said that
statistical mechanics

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.010
is a probabilistic approach.

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:59.700
So we need to establish what
the language of probability is.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.980
And that can be the
topic for the second two

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.130
and half lectures of the course.

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.280
It is something that is less
physics-y, but since the topic

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.286
itself has to deal
with probabilities,

00:02:14.286 --> 00:02:17.770
it is very important,
from my perspective,

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:23.510
to set out the language and
the properties of systems

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.890
that are described
probabilistically.

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.020
Separately, we'll devote a
couple of lectures to do so.

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.060
And in particular,
it is very important

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.750
that the laws of
probability, kind of,

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.860
simplify when you're
dealing with a large number

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.560
of variables, as captured,
for example, by what we

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.850
call the central limit theorem.

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.000
So you can see that the
third element of this course,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.540
which is the law
of large numbers,

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.230
is inherent also to what
simplification you will

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.630
see in the section
on probability.

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.510
And feeds back
very much into how

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.410
statistical mechanics
is developed.

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.180
But then we said large
number of degrees of freedom.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.800
So what are these
degrees of freedom?

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.440
Well, this is now taking
a different perspective.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.480
For us in
thermodynamics, when you

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.130
look at the system
as a black box,

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:29.320
and try to develop laws
based on observations,

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.970
we say that well, from the
perspective of physics,

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.270
we know that this box
contains atoms and molecules.

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:37.240
And these atoms
and molecules are

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:42.690
following very specific laws,
either from Newtonian mechanics

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.250
or quantum mechanics.

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.550
And so if we know everything
about how atoms and molecules

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.840
behave, then we should
be able to derive

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.290
how large collections
of them behave.

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.110
And get the laws
of thermodynamics

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.750
as a consequence of these
microscopic degrees of freedom

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.540
and their dynamics.

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.020
And so that's what
we will discuss

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:08.640
in the third part
of the course that

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.080
is devoted to kinetic theory.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.660
We will see that even at that
stage, it is beneficial to,

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:19.399
rather than follow individual
particles in a system,

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:21.670
to adopt a
probabilistic approach,

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:25.200
and think about densities,
and how those densities evolve

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.920
according to
Liouville's Theorem.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.450
And what we will try
to also establish

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:35.000
is a very distinct
difference that

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.970
exists between
thermodynamics, and where

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:38.830
things are
irreversible and going

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.730
one direction, and Newtonian,
or quantum mechanics,

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:45.160
where things are
reversible in time.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.150
And we'll see that really
it's a matter of adapting

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.100
the right perspective in
order to see that these two

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.270
ways of looking
at the same system

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.950
are not in contradiction.

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:01.290
So having established
these elements,

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:07.070
we will then finally
be in the place

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:11.700
where we can discuss
statistical mechanics in terms

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:17.680
of some postulates about
how probabilities behave

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.580
for systems that
are in equilibrium.

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.490
And how based on
those postulates,

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:26.020
we can then derive all
the laws of thermodynamics

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.410
and all the properties of
thermodynamics systems.

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:31.920
That they're ordained
while observations

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:36.100
and phenomenological
theories before.

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:38.785
Now initially, in
section four, we

00:05:38.785 --> 00:05:42.690
will do that in the context of
classical systems-- description

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:46.870
of particles following
classical laws of motion.

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:48.950
And, again, as a
first simplification,

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:52.930
we will typically deal with
non-interacting systems,

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:54.420
such as ideal gas.

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:57.060
And make sure that we
understand the properties

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.570
of this important
fundamental system

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:03.500
from all possible perspectives.

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:08.860
Then in section five, we will
go on to more realistic systems

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:12.210
where there are interactions
among these particles.

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:15.040
And there are two ways to
then deal with interactions.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:18.220
You can either go by the
way of perturbation theory.

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:21.130
We can start with ideal
system and add a little bit

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:23.970
of interaction, and see
how that changes things.

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:28.300
And we develop some elements of
graphical perturbation theories

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:29.920
in this context.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.840
Or, you can take
another perspective,

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:35.020
and say that because of the
presence of interactions,

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:38.270
the system really adopts
a totally different type

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:39.410
of behavior.

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:41.570
And there's a perspective
known as mean field

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:43.940
theory that allows
you to do that.

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:46.510
Then see how the
same system can be

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:48.740
present in different
phases of matter,

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:52.830
such as liquids and gas,
and how this mean field

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:56.110
type of prescription
allows you to discuss

00:06:56.110 --> 00:07:00.360
the transitions between the
different types of behavior.

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:04.920
Eventually, you will go on,
towards the last quarter

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:09.430
of the course, rather than the
classical description of matter

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:12.890
to a quantum description of the
microscopic degrees of freedom.

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:17.090
And we will see how the
differences and similarities

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:19.210
between quantum
statistical mechanics,

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:21.870
classical statistical
mechanics, emerge.

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:23.860
And just, historically,
of course,

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:27.660
radius macroscopic properties
of the matter, the black body

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:30.100
laws, or heat
capacities, have been

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:33.120
very important in
showing the limitations

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.860
of classical description
of matter, and the need

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:40.730
to have something else, such
as the quantum description.

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:44.070
We will not spend too much
time, more than three lectures,

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:48.380
on the sort of principles of
quantum statistical mechanics.

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:52.040
The place where quantum
statistical mechanics shows

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:56.360
its power is in dealing with
identical particles, which

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:59.590
classically, really
are kind of not

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:03.090
a very well-defined concept,
but quantum-mechanically, they

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:06.450
are very precisely defined,
what identical particles mean.

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:09.270
And there are two classes--
fermions and bosons--

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:15.310
and how even if there's no
interaction between them,

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:20.430
quantum statistics leads to
unusual behavior for quantum

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:24.260
systems of identical particles,
very distinct for fermions

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.330
and for bosons.

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:31.120
So that's a rough syllables of
how the course will be arranged

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:34.720
over the next 25, 26 lectures.

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:37.320
Any questions about what
we're going to cover?

00:08:41.669 --> 00:08:45.940
OK, then let's go here.

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:52.140
So I will be
teaching the course.

00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:58.630
My research is in
condensed matter theory

00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:01.420
and statistical physics.

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:04.510
So this is a subject
that I like very much.

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:09.420
And I hope to impart
some of that love

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:10.960
of statistical physics to you.

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:14.080
And why it is an
interesting topic.

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.950
Lectures and recitations
will be conducted

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:20.020
in this room, Monday,
Wednesday, Friday.

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:22.750
And you ask, well, what does
it mean that both lectures

00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:24.745
and recitations are here?

00:09:24.745 --> 00:09:28.500
Well, for that you will have
to consult the timetable.

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.660
And that's probably
the most important part

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:32.000
of this web page.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.520
And it tells you, for
example, that the first five

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:37.360
events for the
course are all going

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:40.610
to be lectures Monday,
Wednesday, Friday of next week.

00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:44.130
And the first recitation will
come up on Monday, September

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:45.640
the 16th.

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:48.360
And the reason for that
is that the first problem

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:51.620
set will be due on the 18th.

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:58.320
And I will arrange for you to
have six recitations on the six

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:03.370
events that are before the due
dates of those problem sets.

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:06.770
Also indicated here is
the due dates, naturally,

00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:08.240
of the problem sets.

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:12.620
And although I had indicated
that this will be handed out

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:15.230
tomorrow, the first
problem set is already

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:17.750
available on the
web, so you can start

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:20.260
going to take a look at that.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:23.610
And eventually, also
on the web page,

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:27.600
will be posted the solutions.

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:30.620
And the first one
will be posted here.

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:32.740
Of course, it's
not available yet.

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:33.970
Surprisingly.

00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:38.010
Once the due date has passed
on the date that is indicated,

00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:40.560
the solutions will be posted.

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:45.810
Also indicated here is that
there will be various tests.

00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:48.620
The first test will
fall on October 2.

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:50.820
And another time
and recitations will

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:53.520
take place are
prior to the tests.

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.360
So there is actually
three tests,

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:57.060
and there will be
three citations

00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:59.460
that will take
place before that.

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:05.220
And, ultimately, at the end,
there will be a final exam.

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:06.940
It's date I don't know yet.

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:10.640
So I just randomly put it
on the Monday of the week

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:12.940
where the final
exams will be held.

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:16.950
And once the actual date is
announced by the registrar,

00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:19.960
I will make sure that
I put the correct date

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:22.720
and place in this place.

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:31.600
OK, so that's the arrangement
of the various lectures

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:33.660
and recitations.

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:39.800
In addition to me,
the teaching staff

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:48.170
consists of Max [? Imachaov ?]
and Anton Goloborodko.

00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:51.780
Anton is here, sitting
at that extreme corner.

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:53.465
Max, I believe, is now in Paris.

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:04.340
OK, both of them work
on biological systems

00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:07.360
that use a lot of statistical
physics content to them.

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:10.860
So maybe they will tell you
some interesting problems

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:14.200
related to that in
the recitations.

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:17.520
At this point in time, they
have both set their office hours

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:21.550
to be Thursday, 3:00 to
5:00, in their lab, which

00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:26.490
is close to where the
medical facilities are.

00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:29.210
If you find that inconvenient,
you could potentially

00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:32.280
change that, or you
could get in touch

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:37.130
with either the
TAs, or myself, when

00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:40.540
you want to have
specific time to meet us.

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:44.420
Otherwise, I have indicated
my own availability

00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:47.930
to be the half hours
typically after lectures

00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:50.040
on Monday, Wednesdays,
and Fridays.

00:12:56.340 --> 00:13:00.840
One other set of
important things to note

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:04.970
is how the course is organized.

00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:10.400
So I already mentioned to you
what the syllabus of the course

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:11.390
is.

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:15.950
I indicated where and when
the lectures and recitations

00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:17.900
are going to take place.

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:21.450
This is the web page that I
have been surfing through.

00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:25.300
And all of the material will
be posted through the web page,

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:28.260
so that's where you have to go
for problem sets, solutions,

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.710
et cetera.

00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:32.030
Also, grades.

00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:36.150
And, in particular,
I have my own system

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:39.750
of posting the
grades, for which I

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:42.010
need a pseudonym
from each one of you.

00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:45.640
So if you could all go
through this checking online,

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:47.860
indicate your name,
your email address,

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:50.540
and choose a pseudonym,
which I emphasize

00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:53.540
has to be different
from your real name.

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:58.140
And if it is your real name,
I have to randomly come up

00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:02.580
with something like "forgot to
put pseudonym" or something.

00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:07.250
I cannot have your real
name followed by the grades.

00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:08.790
OK?

00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:14.270
I'll discuss anonymous
comments, et cetera, later on.

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:17.220
As you will see,
I will hand out,

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:21.030
through the web page, extensive
lecture notes covering

00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:23.480
all of the material
that I talk about.

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:26.870
So in principle, you
don't need any textbooks.

00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:31.830
You can refer to the notes and
what you write in the lectures.

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:35.480
But certainly, I--
some people like

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:38.270
to have a book sitting
on their bookshelf.

00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:41.060
So I have indicated
a set of books

00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:43.330
that you can put
on your bookshelf.

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:45.840
And hopefully consult
for various topics

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:47.340
at different stages.

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:49.770
And I will, through
the problem sets,

00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:53.320
indicate what are
good useful chapters

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:55.430
or parts of these books
to take a look at.

00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:03.330
Now how is the grade for
the course constructed?

00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:06.900
An important part of it is
through this six problem sets

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:07.970
that we mentioned.

00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:11.520
So each one of them
will count for 5%,

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:15.980
for a total of 30% going towards
the contribution of the problem

00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:16.710
sets.

00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:21.840
I have no problem with
you forming study groups,

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:26.070
as long as each person, at the
end, writes their own solution.

00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:29.540
And I know that if you look
at around sufficiently,

00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:33.400
you can find solutions from
previous years, et cetera,

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:35.540
but you will really
be cheating yourself.

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:37.640
And I really bring
your attention

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:42.520
to the code of honor that
is part of the MIT integrity

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:44.940
handbook.

00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:49.940
We have indicated,
through the schedule page,

00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:53.680
the timeline for this
six problem sets are due.

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:56.410
They are typically
due at 5:00 PM

00:15:56.410 --> 00:15:59.150
on the date that is
indicated on that page,

00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:00.940
and also on the problem set.

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:04.990
And the physics department
will set up a Dropbox,

00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:07.350
so you can put the
problem set there,

00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:09.410
or you can bring it to
the lecture on the date

00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:10.200
that it is due.

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:12.540
That's also acceptable.

00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:17.150
There is a grey area of
about a day or so sometime,

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:21.160
between when the problem set is
due and when the solutions are

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:22.360
posted.

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:25.850
If problem sets are handed
in during that gray area,

00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:28.930
they will count
towards final 50%,

00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:32.120
rather than full
towards the grade.

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:35.600
Unless you sort of write
to me a good excuse

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:40.130
that I can give
you an extension.

00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:43.370
Now every now and then,
people encounter difficulties,

00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:46.030
some particular week you are
overwhelmed, or whatever,

00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:48.750
and you can't do the
particular problem set,

00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:52.270
and they ask me for an
excuse of some form.

00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:55.690
And rather than doing that,
I have the following metric.

00:16:55.690 --> 00:16:57.490
That is, each one
of these problem

00:16:57.490 --> 00:17:00.180
sets you will find that
there's a set of problems

00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:03.090
that are indicated as optional.

00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:04.349
You can do those problems.

00:17:04.349 --> 00:17:07.690
And they will be graded
like all the other problems.

00:17:07.690 --> 00:17:13.180
And in case, at
some later time, you

00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:15.290
didn't hand in some
problem set, or you

00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:17.990
miss half of the
problem set, et cetera,

00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:20.540
what you did on these
optional problems

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:24.930
can be used to make up your
grade, pushing it, eventually,

00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:27.680
up to the 30% mark.

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:30.020
If you don't do any of
the optional problems,

00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:31.650
you just do the
required problem,

00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:35.740
you will correctly you
will reach the 30% mark.

00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:39.950
If you do every single problem,
including optional ones,

00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:45.550
you will not get more than
30%, so the 30% is upper-bound.

00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:46.930
So there's that.

00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:48.600
Then you have the
three tests that

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:53.100
will be taking place during
the lecture time, 2:30 to 4:00,

00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:53.980
here.

00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:58.980
Each one of them will count
15%, so that's another 45%.

00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:02.470
And the remaining 25%
will be the final exam

00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:05.780
that will be scheduled
in the finals week.

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:13.000
So basically, that's the way
that the grades are made up.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:18.860
And the usual definition of
what grades mean-- typically,

00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:20.360
we have been quite generous.

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:23.280
I have to also indicate
that things will not

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:24.960
be graded on a curve.

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:27.580
So that's a MIT policy.

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:31.950
And there are some
links here to places

00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:35.330
that you can go to if you
encounter difficulties

00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:37.880
during the semester.

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:41.330
So any questions about the
organization of the course?

00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:49.960
OK, so let's see
what else we have.

00:18:55.040 --> 00:19:01.400
OK, course outline and
schedule, we already discussed.

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:09.370
They're likely to be
something that are unexpected,

00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:11.026
or some things that
have to be changed.

00:19:11.026 --> 00:19:12.400
Every now and then
there is going

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:17.900
to be a hurricane almost with
probability, close to one.

00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:20.580
We will have a hurricane
sometime during the next month

00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:21.320
or so.

00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:24.950
We may have to postpone
a particular lectures

00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:25.760
accordingly.

00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:28.600
And then the information about
that will be posted here.

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:31.320
Currently, the only
announcement is

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:33.620
what I had indicated
to you before.

00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:35.900
Please check in
online indicating

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:38.130
that you are taking
this course, and what

00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:41.260
your pseudonym is going to be.

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:43.540
OK?

00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:47.640
I give you also the
option, I would certainly

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:50.490
welcome any questions that
you may have for me here.

00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:52.310
Please feel free to interrupt.

00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:56.350
But sometimes people, later
on, encounter questions.

00:19:56.350 --> 00:19:59.640
And for whatever
reason, it may be

00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:01.920
question related to the
material of the course.

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:05.860
It may be related to when
various things are due,

00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:09.910
or it may be there is some wrong
notation in the problem set

00:20:09.910 --> 00:20:14.120
or whatever, you can
certainly anonymously send

00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:16.360
this information to me.

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:20.310
And I will try to respond.

00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:26.380
And anonymous responses will be
posted and displayed web page

00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:27.190
here.

00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:30.100
Currently there is
none, of course.

00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:34.220
And, finally,
something that-- OK,

00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:40.060
so there's a web page where
the problems will be posted.

00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:44.330
And I want to emphasize that
the web page where the solutions

00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:48.570
are posted, you may see
that you cannot get to it.

00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:52.120
And the reason would be that you
don't have an MIT certificate.

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:56.770
So MIT certificates are
necessary to reach the solution

00:20:56.770 --> 00:20:57.950
page.

00:20:57.950 --> 00:21:01.640
And also they are
necessary to reach

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:05.770
the page that is
devoted to tests.

00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:09.390
And actually there is
something about the way

00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:13.490
that I do these three in-class
tests that is polarizing.

00:21:13.490 --> 00:21:16.840
And some people very
much dislike it.

00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:19.270
But that's the way it
is, so let me tell you

00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:21.660
how it's going to be conducted.

00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:26.530
So you will have this one and
a half hour [INAUDIBLE] test.

00:21:26.530 --> 00:21:30.850
And I can tell you, that
the problems from the test

00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:35.800
will be out of this collection
that I already posted here.

00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:40.940
So there is a
collection of problems

00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:43.170
that is posted on this page.

00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:45.400
And furthermore, the
solutions are posted.

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:48.320
So there's a version of
this that is with solution.

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:51.320
So the problems will be
taken from this, as well

00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:54.080
as the problem sets that you
have already encountered--

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:56.530
[INAUDIBLE] solution is posted.

00:21:56.530 --> 00:21:59.775
So if you are familiar
with this material,

00:21:59.775 --> 00:22:02.380
it should be no problem.

00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:06.930
And that's the way the first
three tests this will go.

00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:11.500
The final will be, essentially,
a collection of new problems

00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:14.140
that are variants of things
that you've seen, but will not

00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:16.980
be identical to those.

00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:20.260
OK, so where is my cursor?

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:30.760
And finally, as I
indicated, the grades

00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:33.080
will be posted according
to your pseudonym.

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:36.810
So as time goes on, this
table will be completed.

00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:42.560
And the only other thing to
note is that there's actually

00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:47.090
going to be lecture notes
for the various materials,

00:22:47.090 --> 00:22:49.550
starting from the
first lecture, that

00:22:49.550 --> 00:22:52.877
will be devoted
to thermodynamics.

00:22:52.877 --> 00:22:53.460
Any questions?

00:22:58.135 --> 00:22:59.105
OK.

00:22:59.105 --> 00:23:01.961
So let me copy that
first sentence,

00:23:01.961 --> 00:23:03.960
and we will go on and
talk about thermodynamics.

00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:38.016
The phenomenological description
of equilibrium properties

00:23:38.016 --> 00:23:39.660
of microscopic systems.

00:23:54.570 --> 00:23:55.770
And get rid of this.

00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:23.490
One thing that I
should have emphasized

00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:28.610
when I was doing the syllabus is
that I expect that most of you

00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:31.790
have seen
thermodynamics, have done

00:24:31.790 --> 00:24:34.040
in a certain amount of
statistical mechanics,

00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:35.300
et cetera.

00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:39.230
So the idea here
is really to bring

00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:42.180
the diversity of
backgrounds that you have,

00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:45.090
for our graduate students, and
also I know that our students

00:24:45.090 --> 00:24:49.030
from other departments, more or
less in line with each other.

00:24:49.030 --> 00:24:51.020
So a lot of these
things I expect

00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:53.680
to be, kind of, review
materials, or things

00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:55.080
that you have seen.

00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:59.480
That's one reason that we kind
of go through them rapidly.

00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:01.580
And hopefully,
however, there will

00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:06.900
be some kind of logical
systematic way of thinking

00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:10.380
about the entirety of them
that would be useful to you.

00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:13.980
And in particular,
thermodynamics, you say,

00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:16.090
is an old subject, and
if you're ultimately

00:25:16.090 --> 00:25:18.390
going to derive the
laws of thermodynamics

00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:23.260
from some more precise
microscopic description,

00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:25.970
why should we go
through this exercise?

00:25:25.970 --> 00:25:28.220
The reason is that
there is really

00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:31.120
a beautiful example
of how you can

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:34.020
look at the system
as a black box,

00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:36.860
and gradually, based
on observation,

00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:40.040
build a consistent
mathematical framework

00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:41.870
to describe its properties.

00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:45.690
And it is useful
in various branches

00:25:45.690 --> 00:25:47.690
of science and physics.

00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:52.120
And kind of a more 20th century
example that I can think of

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:54.700
is, Landau's approach
to superconductivity

00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:58.710
and superfluidity, where without
knowing the microscopic origin

00:25:58.710 --> 00:26:01.490
of that, based on
kind of phenomenology,

00:26:01.490 --> 00:26:04.690
you could write down
very precise description

00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:07.346
of the kinds of things
that superconductors

00:26:07.346 --> 00:26:10.410
and superfluids could manifest.

00:26:10.410 --> 00:26:15.680
So let's sort of put
yourselves, put ourselves,

00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:19.500
in the perspective of how
this science of thermodynamics

00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:20.720
was developed.

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:25.520
And this is at the time
where Newtonian mechanics had

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:26.930
shown its power.

00:26:26.930 --> 00:26:30.020
It can describe orbits of
things going around the sun,

00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:31.720
and all kinds of other things.

00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:36.400
But that description,
clearly, does not

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:42.380
apply to very simple things like
how you heat up a pan of water.

00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:45.605
So there's some elements,
including thermal properties,

00:26:45.605 --> 00:26:47.930
that are missing from
that description.

00:26:47.930 --> 00:26:49.860
And you would like to
complete that theory,

00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:53.590
or develop a theory, that
is able to describe also

00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:55.800
heat and thermal properties.

00:26:55.800 --> 00:27:01.220
So how do you go about that,
given that your perspective is

00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:04.050
the Newtonian prescription?

00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:08.490
So first thing to
sort of a, kind of,

00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:12.510
parse among all of these
elements, is system.

00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:16.420
So when describing
Newtonian mechanics,

00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:18.730
you sort of idealize,
certainly you

00:27:18.730 --> 00:27:22.810
realize that Newtonian mechanics
does not describe things

00:27:22.810 --> 00:27:24.320
that we see in everyday world.

00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:26.420
You kind of think
about point particle

00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:29.310
and how a point particle
would move in free space.

00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:36.680
And so let's try to do a similar
thing for our kinds of systems.

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:40.080
And the thing that is
causing us some difficulty

00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:43.370
is this issue of heat.

00:27:43.370 --> 00:27:48.520
And so what you can do
is you can potentially

00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:58.440
isolate your system thermally
by, what I would call,

00:27:58.440 --> 00:27:59.480
adiabatic laws.

00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:09.280
Basically say that there's
these things, such as heat,

00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:12.370
that goes into the system
that causes difficulty for me.

00:28:12.370 --> 00:28:14.230
So let's imagine in
the same that I'm

00:28:14.230 --> 00:28:16.900
thinking of the point
particle, that whatever

00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:21.350
I have is isolated from
the rest of the universe,

00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:25.030
in some kind of box that
does not allow heat transfer.

00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:32.080
This is to be opposed with
walls that we would like

00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:39.590
to eventually look at, which
do allow heat transfer.

00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:41.510
Let me choose a different color.

00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:43.410
Let's say green.

00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:52.970
So ultimately, I want to
allow the exchange of whatever

00:28:52.970 --> 00:28:54.960
this heat is in
thermal properties

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:58.720
to go and take place
with my system.

00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:01.360
OK?

00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:04.420
Now, this is
basically isolation.

00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:13.460
The next element is to
wait for your system

00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:14.690
to come to equilibrium.

00:29:14.690 --> 00:29:23.740
be You realize that when
you, for example, start

00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:25.140
with something
that is like this,

00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:28.520
you change one of the walls
to allow heat to go into it.

00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:30.720
Then the system
undergoes some changes.

00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:34.010
Properties that you're
measuring are not

00:29:34.010 --> 00:29:37.300
well-defined over some
period where these changes

00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:40.270
taking place, but if
you wait sufficiently,

00:29:40.270 --> 00:29:42.670
then they relax to
some new values.

00:29:42.670 --> 00:29:45.690
And then you can start
making measurements.

00:29:45.690 --> 00:29:55.120
So this is when
properties don't change.

00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:59.220
And the key here is
observation time.

00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:01.900
This is part of
the phenomenology,

00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:03.500
because it is not precise.

00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:05.700
I can't tell you how
long you have to wait.

00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:08.370
It depends on the system
under consideration.

00:30:08.370 --> 00:30:11.680
And some systems come
to equilibrium easily,

00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:13.910
some take a long time.

00:30:13.910 --> 00:30:17.650
So what are the properties
that you can measure?

00:30:17.650 --> 00:30:23.600
Once things have settled down
and no longer change with time,

00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:28.200
you can start to measure
various properties.

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:31.435
The ones that are very
easy for you to identify

00:30:31.435 --> 00:30:35.670
are things that are associated
with mechanical work,

00:30:35.670 --> 00:30:37.720
or mechanical properties.

00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:45.660
And, for example, if you have
a box that contains a gas,

00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:49.640
you can immediately see well,
what's the volume of the gas?

00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:51.950
You can calculate
what pressure it

00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:54.670
is exerting on its environment.

00:30:54.670 --> 00:30:56.270
So this is for a gas.

00:30:56.270 --> 00:30:58.970
You could have, for
example, a wire.

00:30:58.970 --> 00:31:02.090
If you have a wire, you
could calculate, rather than

00:31:02.090 --> 00:31:04.740
its volume, its
length and the force

00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:06.940
with which you are pulling it.

00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:10.980
It could be something
like a magnet.

00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:14.830
And you could put some kind
of a magnetic field on it,

00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:17.740
and figure out what
the magnetization is.

00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:21.810
And this list of mechanical
properties goes on.

00:31:21.810 --> 00:31:24.700
But you know that that's
not the end of the story.

00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:29.380
You kind of expect that there
are additional things that

00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:32.400
have to do with thermal
aspects that you

00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:34.330
haven't taken into account.

00:31:34.330 --> 00:31:37.570
And as of yet, you don't
quite know what they are.

00:31:37.570 --> 00:31:41.970
And you have to gradually
build upon those properties.

00:31:41.970 --> 00:31:45.580
So you have a system.

00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:48.160
These are kind of the
analogs of the coordinates

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:49.900
and potentially
velocities that you

00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:52.210
would have for any
Newtonian particles.

00:31:52.210 --> 00:31:56.990
A way of describing
your idealized system.

00:31:56.990 --> 00:32:03.330
And then you want to find rules
by which these coordinates are

00:32:03.330 --> 00:32:05.870
coevolving, or doing
things together.

00:32:05.870 --> 00:32:14.150
And so for that you
rely on observations,

00:32:14.150 --> 00:32:17.039
and construct laws
of thermodynamics.

00:32:26.150 --> 00:32:30.700
All right so this is
the general approach.

00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:32.890
And once you follow
this, let's say,

00:32:32.890 --> 00:32:36.290
what's the first thing
that you encounter?

00:32:36.290 --> 00:32:40.530
You encounter what is
encoded to the zeroth law.

00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:46.190
What's the zeroth law?

00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:50.540
The zeroth law is the
following statement,

00:32:50.540 --> 00:33:02.210
if two systems-- let's call
them A and B-- are separately

00:33:02.210 --> 00:33:18.940
in equilibrium with C--
with a third system-- then

00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:20.620
they are in equilibrium
with each other.

00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:37.700
This is sort of this
statement that the property

00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:41.765
of equilibrium has the
character of transitivity.

00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:59.310
So what that means, pictorially,
is something like this.

00:34:02.670 --> 00:34:15.040
Suppose I have my two boxes,
A and B. And the third system

00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:19.960
that we're calling C.
And we've established

00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:23.690
that A and B are separately
in thermal equilibrium with C,

00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:28.949
which means that we have
allowed exchange of heat

00:34:28.949 --> 00:34:33.610
to take place between A
and C, between B and C,

00:34:33.610 --> 00:34:36.564
but currently, we
assume nothing--

00:34:36.564 --> 00:34:42.050
or we assume that B and C are
not connected to each other.

00:34:42.050 --> 00:34:44.210
The statement of
the law is that if I

00:34:44.210 --> 00:34:57.650
were to replace this red with
green, so that I have also

00:34:57.650 --> 00:35:02.700
exchange that is going
on between A and B,

00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:04.870
then nothing happens.

00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:07.450
A and B are already
in equilibrium,

00:35:07.450 --> 00:35:11.960
and the fact that you open
the possibility of exchange

00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:15.730
of heat between them
does not change things.

00:35:15.730 --> 00:35:20.060
And again, this is this
consequence of transitivity.

00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:24.030
And one of its kind of
important implications

00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:27.230
ultimately is that
we are allowed now

00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:32.480
based on this to add one more
coordinate to this description

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:34.810
that you have.

00:35:34.810 --> 00:35:38.730
That coordinate is the
analog of temperature.

00:35:38.730 --> 00:35:47.460
So this transitivity really
implies the existence

00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:49.620
of some kind of
empirical temperature.

00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:57.160
And you may say well, this
is such an obvious thing,

00:35:57.160 --> 00:35:59.140
there should be transitivity.

00:35:59.140 --> 00:36:01.580
Well, I want to
usually give people

00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:05.960
examples that transitivity
is not a universal property,

00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:06.960
by as follows.

00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:10.390
Suppose that within
this room, there

00:36:10.390 --> 00:36:13.240
is A who wants to
go on a date with C,

00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:15.930
and B who wants to
go on a date with C.

00:36:15.930 --> 00:36:19.190
I'm pretty sure that it's not
going to be the property that A

00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:25.530
wants to go through the
date with B. It's 20%.

00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:26.040
All right.

00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:34.080
So let's see how
we can ensure this.

00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:40.400
So we said that if some system
has reached equilibrium,

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:42.440
it has some set of coordinates.

00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:44.260
Let's call them
A1, A2, et cetera.

00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:45.430
There's some number of them.

00:36:45.430 --> 00:36:46.660
We don't know.

00:36:46.660 --> 00:36:50.040
Similarly, here, we
have C1, C2, et cetera.

00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:55.130
And for B, we have B1, B2.

00:36:55.130 --> 00:37:03.200
Now what does it mean that I
have equilibrium of A and B?

00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:09.010
The implication is that if
I have a system by itself,

00:37:09.010 --> 00:37:11.130
I have a bunch of
possible coordinates.

00:37:11.130 --> 00:37:13.610
I can be anywhere in
this coordinate space.

00:37:13.610 --> 00:37:16.440
And if I separately
have system C,

00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:18.420
I have another bunch
of coordinates.

00:37:18.420 --> 00:37:21.700
And I can be anywhere in
this coordinate space.

00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:26.150
But if I force A and B to come
together and exchange heat

00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:29.420
and reaches equilibrium,
that is a constraint,

00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:32.820
which means that this set of
coordinates of the two cannot

00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:34.660
be independently varied.

00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:38.980
There has to be some functional
relationship between them,

00:37:38.980 --> 00:37:43.750
which we can, for example,
cast into this form.

00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:46.270
So equilibrium, one
constraint, one kind

00:37:46.270 --> 00:37:48.310
of mathematical relation.

00:37:48.310 --> 00:37:51.470
Similarly, equilibrium
of-- this was A

00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:57.510
and C, B and C-- would
give us some other function

00:37:57.510 --> 00:38:07.080
BC of coordinates of B and
coordinates of C equal to 0.

00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:09.730
OK?

00:38:09.730 --> 00:38:15.540
So there is one
thing that I can do.

00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:21.960
I can take this expression
and recast it, and write it

00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:25.160
as let's say, the first
coordinate that describes

00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:29.500
C is some other function,
which I will call big F

00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:36.600
AC of coordinates of
A. And all coordinates

00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:41.650
of C, except the first
one that I have removed.

00:38:41.650 --> 00:38:44.130
Yes?

00:38:44.130 --> 00:38:47.810
AUDIENCE: When you
put that function F

00:38:47.810 --> 00:38:50.500
AC or all the coordinates of
A, and all the coordinates of C

00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:56.480
being zero, is that
[? polynomy ?] always going

00:38:56.480 --> 00:39:00.170
to be true for the first law,
or do you just give an example?

00:39:07.340 --> 00:39:10.130
PROFESSOR: It will
be always true

00:39:10.130 --> 00:39:14.360
that I have some set
of coordinates for 1,

00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:18.200
some set of coordinates
with 2, and equilibrium

00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:20.460
for the two sets
of coordinates is

00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:24.010
going to be expressible in
terms of some function that

00:39:24.010 --> 00:39:26.230
could be arbitrarily
complicated.

00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:29.240
It may be that I
can't even write this,

00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:33.220
but I have to graph it,
or some kind of place

00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:34.410
in the coordinates space.

00:39:34.410 --> 00:39:36.250
So what I mean is
the following, you

00:39:36.250 --> 00:39:38.560
can imagine some
higher dimensional

00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:41.440
space that is spanned
by As and the Cs.

00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:44.160
And each point, where the
things are in equilibrium,

00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:49.150
will be some-- you can put a
cross in this coordinate space.

00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:52.000
And you can span
the various places

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.910
where equilibration takes place.

00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:57.490
And you will have a
surface in this space.

00:39:57.490 --> 00:40:00.280
And that surface potential you
can describe mathematically

00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:02.354
like this.

00:40:02.354 --> 00:40:03.260
OK?

00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:06.300
And similarly, I can
do the same thing.

00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:09.540
And pick out coordinate
C1 here, and write it

00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:22.020
as F BC of A1, A2, and C2,
C3-- sorry, this is B1, B2.

00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:26.020
Actually, this brings me, this
question, to maybe one point

00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:27.190
that I should make.

00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:31.270
That sometimes during this
course, I will do things,

00:40:31.270 --> 00:40:33.130
and maybe I will
even say that I do

00:40:33.130 --> 00:40:36.330
things that are physically
rigorous, but maybe not

00:40:36.330 --> 00:40:38.460
so mathematically.

00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:42.240
And one example of this is
precisely this statement.

00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:44.010
That is, if you
give a mathematician

00:40:44.010 --> 00:40:45.610
and there is a
function like this.

00:40:45.610 --> 00:40:48.329
And then you pick one,
C1, and you write it

00:40:48.329 --> 00:40:49.870
as a function of
all the others, they

00:40:49.870 --> 00:40:53.230
say, oh, how do know that
that's even possible, that this

00:40:53.230 --> 00:40:55.010
exists?

00:40:55.010 --> 00:40:57.030
And generally, it isn't.

00:40:57.030 --> 00:40:59.860
A simple example would
be A squared plus C

00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:04.590
squared equals to zero,
then C's multiple valued.

00:41:04.590 --> 00:41:08.390
So the reason this
is physically correct

00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:11.940
is because if we set up
this situation, and really

00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:13.790
these very physical
quantities, I

00:41:13.790 --> 00:41:17.540
know that I dialed my
C1 to this number here,

00:41:17.540 --> 00:41:19.560
and all of the other
things adjusted.

00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:22.160
So this is kind
of physically OK,

00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:25.420
although mathematically, you
would have to potentially do

00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:30.490
a lot of [INAUDIBLE] to
arrive at this stage.

00:41:30.490 --> 00:41:31.870
OK.

00:41:31.870 --> 00:41:36.870
So now if I have to put all
of those things together,

00:41:36.870 --> 00:41:40.540
the fact that I have
equilibrium of A and B,

00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:46.460
plus equilibrium
of B and C, then

00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:50.170
implies that there
is eliminating

00:41:50.170 --> 00:41:52.890
C1 between these
two, some function

00:41:52.890 --> 00:41:57.120
that depends on the coordinates
of A and coordinates of C,

00:41:57.120 --> 00:42:00.870
starting from the second one,
equal to some other function.

00:42:00.870 --> 00:42:04.090
And these functions
could be very different,

00:42:04.090 --> 00:42:07.420
coordinates of B
and coordinates of C

00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:09.820
starting from the second one.

00:42:09.820 --> 00:42:10.350
Yes?

00:42:10.350 --> 00:42:12.562
AUDIENCE: Do you need A
and C on the left there?

00:42:12.562 --> 00:42:14.353
PROFESSOR: A and C,
and B and C. Thank you.

00:42:19.183 --> 00:42:20.640
OK?

00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:24.410
So this, everything that
we have worked out here,

00:42:24.410 --> 00:42:27.350
really concerns
putting the first part

00:42:27.350 --> 00:42:32.870
of this equation in
mathematical form.

00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:35.730
But this statement--
in mathematical form--

00:42:35.730 --> 00:42:38.830
but given the first part
of this statement, that

00:42:38.830 --> 00:42:41.900
is, the second part
of the statement, that

00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:47.710
is that I know that if I remove
that red and make it green,

00:42:47.710 --> 00:42:51.330
so that heat can exchange, for
the same values of A and B,

00:42:51.330 --> 00:42:54.880
A and B are in equilibrium, so I
know that there is a functional

00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:56.200
form.

00:42:56.200 --> 00:43:03.150
So this is equilibrium
of A and B, implies

00:43:03.150 --> 00:43:07.910
that there is this function
that we were looking at before,

00:43:07.910 --> 00:43:13.400
that relates
coordinates of A and B

00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:15.430
that constrains the
equilibrium that

00:43:15.430 --> 00:43:19.880
should exist
between A and B. OK.

00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:23.650
So the first part of the
statement of the zeroth law,

00:43:23.650 --> 00:43:27.210
and the second part of the
statement of the zeroth law

00:43:27.210 --> 00:43:31.910
can be written mathematically
in these two forms.

00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:37.920
And the nice part
about the first part

00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:41.300
is that it says that the
equilibrium constraint that I

00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:44.930
have between A's and
B's can mathematically

00:43:44.930 --> 00:43:49.730
be kind of spread out into some
function on the left that only

00:43:49.730 --> 00:43:52.180
depends on the
coordinates of A, and some

00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:59.300
function on the right that only
depends on coordinates of B.

00:43:59.300 --> 00:44:02.210
So that's important,
because it says

00:44:02.210 --> 00:44:07.760
that ultimately the
equilibration between two

00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:11.680
objects can be
cast mathematically

00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:13.760
as having some kind
of a function--

00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:16.700
and we don't know anything about
the form of that function--

00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:20.540
that only depends on
the coordinates of A.

00:44:20.540 --> 00:44:25.420
And equilibration
implies that there exists

00:44:25.420 --> 00:44:28.260
some other function
that only depends

00:44:28.260 --> 00:44:30.420
on the coordinates
of the other one.

00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:35.130
And in equilibrium, those
two functional forms

00:44:35.130 --> 00:44:37.330
have to be the same.

00:44:37.330 --> 00:44:44.010
Now, there's two ways of getting
to this statement from the two

00:44:44.010 --> 00:44:46.850
things that I have
within up there.

00:44:46.850 --> 00:44:50.610
One of them is to choose some
particular reference system

00:44:50.610 --> 00:44:54.450
for C. Let's say
your C is seawater

00:44:54.450 --> 00:44:57.490
at some particular
set of conditions.

00:44:57.490 --> 00:45:01.190
And so then, these
are really constants

00:45:01.190 --> 00:45:03.795
that are appropriate
to see water.

00:45:03.795 --> 00:45:06.710
And then you have
chosen a function that

00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:10.340
depends on variables of A, of
course of some function of B.

00:45:10.340 --> 00:45:12.550
Or you can say,
well, I can replace

00:45:12.550 --> 00:45:14.710
this seawater by something else.

00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:18.220
And irrespective
of what I choose,

00:45:18.220 --> 00:45:22.500
A and B, there by our definition
in equilibrium with each other,

00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:27.650
no matter what I did with C. Or
some various range of C things

00:45:27.650 --> 00:45:31.670
that I can do, maintaining this
equilibrium between A and B.

00:45:31.670 --> 00:45:34.350
So in that perspective,
the C variables

00:45:34.350 --> 00:45:35.870
are dummy coordinates.

00:45:35.870 --> 00:45:38.560
So you should be able
to cancel them out

00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:40.800
from the two sides
of the equation,

00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:44.910
and get some kind
of a form like this.

00:45:44.910 --> 00:45:47.980
Either way, what
that really means

00:45:47.980 --> 00:45:55.740
is that if I list all of
the coordinates of, say, A,

00:45:55.740 --> 00:46:01.930
and I put it, say, in
equilibrium with a bath that

00:46:01.930 --> 00:46:04.650
is at some particular
temperature,

00:46:04.650 --> 00:46:07.580
the coordinates of A
and B are constrained

00:46:07.580 --> 00:46:11.020
to lie in some particular
surface that would correspond

00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:13.680
to that particular theta.

00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:19.670
And if I have
another system for B,

00:46:19.670 --> 00:46:23.270
the isotherm could have
completely different for that

00:46:23.270 --> 00:46:24.750
data.

00:46:24.750 --> 00:46:27.800
But any time A and B
are in equilibrium,

00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:30.555
they would be lying
on the isotherm that

00:46:30.555 --> 00:46:33.350
would correspond
to the same fate.

00:46:33.350 --> 00:46:36.580
Now, again, a mechanical
version of this,

00:46:36.580 --> 00:46:40.210
that is certainly
hopefully demystifies

00:46:40.210 --> 00:46:43.890
any mystification that may
remain, is to think a scale.

00:46:47.890 --> 00:46:50.050
You have something
A on this scale.

00:46:50.050 --> 00:46:51.830
And you have something
C on this scale.

00:46:51.830 --> 00:46:53.355
And the scale is balanced.

00:46:53.355 --> 00:46:59.390
You replace A with B, and
B and C are in balance,

00:46:59.390 --> 00:47:02.220
then you know that A and B are
in balance with each other.

00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:04.450
And that implies
that, indeed, there

00:47:04.450 --> 00:47:08.552
is a property of the objects
that you put on the balance.

00:47:08.552 --> 00:47:10.010
You can either
think of it as mass,

00:47:10.010 --> 00:47:12.980
or more appropriately,
the gravitational force

00:47:12.980 --> 00:47:16.190
that they experience,
that they need.

00:47:16.190 --> 00:47:17.290
The thing is balanced.

00:47:17.290 --> 00:47:19.090
The forces are equal.

00:47:19.090 --> 00:47:21.230
So it's essentially
the same thing.

00:47:21.230 --> 00:47:23.520
Now having established
this, then you

00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:27.150
want to go and figure
out what the formula is

00:47:27.150 --> 00:47:31.320
that relates the property
that needs to be balanced,

00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:34.120
which is maybe the mass or the
gravitational force in terms

00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:36.530
of density, volume, et cetera.

00:47:36.530 --> 00:47:38.400
So that's what you
would like to do here.

00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:43.520
We would like to be able
to relate this temperature

00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:46.510
function to all the other
coordinates of the system,

00:47:46.510 --> 00:47:48.087
as we're going to.

00:47:48.087 --> 00:47:48.670
Any questions?

00:47:53.450 --> 00:47:54.858
Yes?

00:47:54.858 --> 00:47:58.211
AUDIENCE: So how did [INAUDIBLE]
that there is the isotherm?

00:47:58.211 --> 00:48:01.570
Is it coming from the
second conclusion?

00:48:01.570 --> 00:48:02.310
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:48:02.310 --> 00:48:08.320
So what we have said is
that when two objects are

00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:13.170
in equilibrium, this
function is the same between.

00:48:13.170 --> 00:48:17.270
So let's say that we
pick some kind of a vat--

00:48:17.270 --> 00:48:19.190
like, it could be a lake.

00:48:19.190 --> 00:48:21.930
And we know that
the lake is so big

00:48:21.930 --> 00:48:24.710
that if you put something
in equilibrium with that,

00:48:24.710 --> 00:48:28.520
it's not extracting too much
heat or whatever from the lake

00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:33.390
can change its
temperature function.

00:48:33.390 --> 00:48:37.300
So we put our system
in equilibrium

00:48:37.300 --> 00:48:40.420
with the lake, which is
at some particular fixed

00:48:40.420 --> 00:48:41.130
value of theta.

00:48:41.130 --> 00:48:45.520
And we don't know what theta
is, but it's a constant.

00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:48.560
So if I were to fiddle
around with the system

00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:51.080
that I put in the lake--
I change its volume,

00:48:51.080 --> 00:48:53.600
I change its length,
I do something--

00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:55.850
and it stays in equilibrium
with the length,

00:48:55.850 --> 00:48:58.210
there is some function
of the coordinates

00:48:58.210 --> 00:49:01.160
of that system that
is equal to theta.

00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:07.320
So again, in general,
I can make a diagram

00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:12.790
that has various coordinates
of the system, A1, A2, A3.

00:49:12.790 --> 00:49:18.460
And for every combination
that is that this theta,

00:49:18.460 --> 00:49:20.700
I will put a point here.

00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:24.410
And in principle, I can
vary these coordinates.

00:49:24.410 --> 00:49:27.120
And this amounts
to one constraint

00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:30.160
in however many
dimensional space I have.

00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:34.170
So if we span some
kind of a surface--

00:49:34.170 --> 00:49:35.925
so if you're in three
dimension, there

00:49:35.925 --> 00:49:37.605
would be a two
dimensional surface.

00:49:37.605 --> 00:49:38.980
If you're in two
dimension, there

00:49:38.980 --> 00:49:42.950
would be a line that would
correspond to this constraint.

00:49:42.950 --> 00:49:45.480
Presumably, if I change
the lake with something

00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:47.860
else, so that theta
changes, I will

00:49:47.860 --> 00:49:51.685
be prescribing some other curve
and some other surface in this.

00:49:51.685 --> 00:49:58.415
Now these are surfaces
in coordinate space of A.

00:49:58.415 --> 00:50:02.880
In order to be in equilibrium
with an entity at the fixed

00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:07.320
value of theta, they prescribe
some particular surface

00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:10.765
in the entire coordinate space
and they're called isotherms.

00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:18.560
OK?

00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:20.740
Actually, let's
state that a little

00:50:20.740 --> 00:50:26.840
bit further, because
you would like

00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:31.020
to give a number to
temperature, so many degrees

00:50:31.020 --> 00:50:33.820
Celsius, or Fahrenheit,
or whatever.

00:50:33.820 --> 00:50:36.700
So how do you do that?

00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:45.670
And one way to do that is to
use what is called the ideal gas

00:50:45.670 --> 00:50:49.330
temperature space--
the ideal gas scale.

00:50:54.520 --> 00:50:58.040
So you need some
property at this stage

00:50:58.040 --> 00:51:02.870
in order to construct
a temperature scale.

00:51:02.870 --> 00:51:07.810
And it turns out that a
gas is a system that we

00:51:07.810 --> 00:51:11.550
keep coming back
to again and again.

00:51:11.550 --> 00:51:15.670
So as I go through the various
laws of thermodynamics,

00:51:15.670 --> 00:51:18.260
I will mention
something special that

00:51:18.260 --> 00:51:23.100
happens to this law for
the case of this ideal gas.

00:51:23.100 --> 00:51:25.160
And actually, right
now, define also

00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:27.940
what I mean by the ideal gas.

00:51:27.940 --> 00:51:31.740
So we said that a
gas, in general, you

00:51:31.740 --> 00:51:37.710
can define through
coordinates P and V.

00:51:37.710 --> 00:51:42.140
So if I put this
gas in a piston,

00:51:42.140 --> 00:51:47.990
and I submerge this piston,
let's say in a lake,

00:51:47.990 --> 00:51:53.270
so that it is always at whatever
temperature this lake is.

00:51:53.270 --> 00:51:57.500
Then I can change
the volume of this,

00:51:57.500 --> 00:52:00.080
and measure what the pressure
is, or change the pressure,

00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:02.180
and figure out
what the volume is.

00:52:02.180 --> 00:52:08.180
And I find out that there is
a surface in this space where

00:52:08.180 --> 00:52:11.850
this curve that corresponds
to being equilibrium

00:52:11.850 --> 00:52:15.780
with this [? leaves-- ?] this
is the measure of the isotherm.

00:52:15.780 --> 00:52:21.850
Now the ideal gas law is that
when I go to the limit there,

00:52:21.850 --> 00:52:27.430
V goes to infinity,
or P goes to zero.

00:52:27.430 --> 00:52:31.130
So that the whole thing
becomes very dilute.

00:52:31.130 --> 00:52:33.290
No matter what
gas you put here--

00:52:33.290 --> 00:52:35.400
whether it's argon,
oxygen, krypton,

00:52:35.400 --> 00:52:43.020
whatever-- you find that in this
limit, this shape of this curve

00:52:43.020 --> 00:52:47.220
is special in the sense
that if you were to increase

00:52:47.220 --> 00:52:49.310
the volume by a factor
of two, the pressure

00:52:49.310 --> 00:52:51.670
will go down by a
factor of two, such

00:52:51.670 --> 00:52:53.740
that the product
PV is a constant.

00:52:58.160 --> 00:53:01.650
And again, this is
only true in the limit

00:53:01.650 --> 00:53:04.980
where either V goes to
infinity or P goes to 0.

00:53:04.980 --> 00:53:07.770
And this is the property
that all gases have.

00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:13.390
So you say OK, I will use that.

00:53:13.390 --> 00:53:17.000
Maybe I will define what
the value of this product

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:20.260
is to be the temperature.

00:53:20.260 --> 00:53:24.290
So if I were to replace
this bath with a bath that

00:53:24.290 --> 00:53:28.430
was hotter than this product
for the same amount of gas,

00:53:28.430 --> 00:53:30.590
for the same wire,
would be different.

00:53:30.590 --> 00:53:33.726
And I would get a
different constant.

00:53:33.726 --> 00:53:35.520
You maybe still want a number.

00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:40.400
So what you say is
that the temperature

00:53:40.400 --> 00:53:51.340
of the system in degrees
Kelvin is 273 times 16.

00:53:51.340 --> 00:54:04.030
The limit of PV, as V goes
to infinity of your system,

00:54:04.030 --> 00:54:10.300
divided by the limit
of the same thing

00:54:10.300 --> 00:54:18.240
at the triple point
of water [? iced. ?]

00:54:22.070 --> 00:54:24.620
So what does that mean?

00:54:24.620 --> 00:54:29.090
So you have this
thing by which you

00:54:29.090 --> 00:54:31.330
want to measure temperature.

00:54:31.330 --> 00:54:33.860
You put it in contact
with the system-- could

00:54:33.860 --> 00:54:37.510
be a bath of water,
could be anything, yes?

00:54:37.510 --> 00:54:39.310
You go through this
exercise and you

00:54:39.310 --> 00:54:42.510
calculate what this product is.

00:54:42.510 --> 00:54:44.830
So you have this product.

00:54:44.830 --> 00:54:48.870
Then what you do is
you take your system,

00:54:48.870 --> 00:54:52.800
and you put it in a case
that there are icebergs,

00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:54.320
and there's water,
and there will

00:54:54.320 --> 00:54:58.610
be some steam that will
naturally evaporate.

00:54:58.610 --> 00:55:02.080
So you calculate the
same product of PV

00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:05.380
in this system that
is the triple point

00:55:05.380 --> 00:55:07.720
of ice water, et cetera.

00:55:07.720 --> 00:55:11.810
So you've measured one product
appropriate to your system,

00:55:11.810 --> 00:55:14.380
one product appropriate
to this reference

00:55:14.380 --> 00:55:19.290
point that people have set, and
then the ratio of those things

00:55:19.290 --> 00:55:22.340
is going to give you the
temperature of the system

00:55:22.340 --> 00:55:24.130
that you want to measure.

00:55:24.130 --> 00:55:27.740
This is clearly a very
convoluted way of doing things,

00:55:27.740 --> 00:55:31.150
but it's a kind of
rigorous definition of what

00:55:31.150 --> 00:55:34.470
the ideal gas
temperature scale is.

00:55:34.470 --> 00:55:38.300
And it depends on this
particular property

00:55:38.300 --> 00:55:44.290
of the diluted gases that the
production of PV is a constant.

00:55:44.290 --> 00:55:49.880
And again, this number
is set by definition

00:55:49.880 --> 00:55:53.930
to be the temperature of the
triple point of the ice water

00:55:53.930 --> 00:55:54.430
gas.

00:56:08.670 --> 00:56:10.634
OK.

00:56:10.634 --> 00:56:11.300
Other questions?

00:56:13.930 --> 00:56:14.820
All right.

00:56:14.820 --> 00:56:20.360
So this is now time to
go through the first law.

00:56:24.070 --> 00:56:28.470
Now I'll write again
this statement,

00:56:28.470 --> 00:56:31.690
and then we'll start to
discuss what it really means.

00:56:31.690 --> 00:56:56.250
So if the state of an otherwise
adiabatically isolated system

00:56:56.250 --> 00:57:14.750
is changed by work,
the amount of work

00:57:14.750 --> 00:57:22.900
is only function of
initial and final points.

00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:32.740
OK.

00:57:32.740 --> 00:57:36.270
So let's parse what
that means and think

00:57:36.270 --> 00:57:38.000
about some particular example.

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:42.575
So let's imagine that we
have isolated some system.

00:57:46.570 --> 00:57:49.740
So that it's not
completely boring,

00:57:49.740 --> 00:57:52.380
let's imagine that
maybe it's a gas.

00:57:52.380 --> 00:57:56.590
So it has P and V as
some set of coordinates.

00:57:56.590 --> 00:58:00.470
Let's say that we put some
kind of a spring or wire in it,

00:58:00.470 --> 00:58:01.730
so we can pull on it.

00:58:01.730 --> 00:58:04.030
And we can ask how
much we pulled,

00:58:04.030 --> 00:58:07.410
and what is the
length of this system.

00:58:07.410 --> 00:58:09.530
Maybe we even put
a magnet in it,

00:58:09.530 --> 00:58:15.080
so we have magnetization
that we can measure

00:58:15.080 --> 00:58:19.070
if we were to pass
some kind of a current

00:58:19.070 --> 00:58:21.630
and exert some kind
of magnetic field.

00:58:21.630 --> 00:58:24.520
So there's a whole
bunch of coordinates

00:58:24.520 --> 00:58:30.420
that I'm completely familiar
with from doing my mechanics

00:58:30.420 --> 00:58:32.760
courses and
electromagnetic courses.

00:58:32.760 --> 00:58:38.880
So I know various ways to do
mechanical work on this system.

00:58:38.880 --> 00:58:43.630
So the system is
otherwise isolated,

00:58:43.630 --> 00:58:48.640
because I don't really know how
to handle this concept of heat

00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:52.380
yet, but I certainly have no
problems with mechanical work.

00:58:52.380 --> 00:58:57.320
And so what I do is, I imagine
that it is initially isolated.

00:58:57.320 --> 00:59:01.570
What I do is therefore, I
have some-- in this case,

00:59:01.570 --> 00:59:03.780
six dimensional
coordinate space.

00:59:03.780 --> 00:59:06.940
I'm will only draw
two out of the six.

00:59:06.940 --> 00:59:12.640
And I start some initial
point, let's call it I.

00:59:12.640 --> 00:59:16.380
And then I start doing various
types of things to this.

00:59:16.380 --> 00:59:19.270
I could, for example,
first pull on this,

00:59:19.270 --> 00:59:21.110
so that the length
changes, changes

00:59:21.110 --> 00:59:24.810
the current, put
pressure so that

00:59:24.810 --> 00:59:26.840
the volume changes, et cetera.

00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:29.385
At the end of this story,
I'm at some other point

00:59:29.385 --> 00:59:32.250
that I will call F.

00:59:32.250 --> 00:59:36.980
Now I could have performed
this change from the initial

00:59:36.980 --> 00:59:41.610
to the final state
through one set of changes

00:59:41.610 --> 00:59:44.640
taking place one
after the other.

00:59:44.640 --> 00:59:48.350
But maybe I will change that,
and I will perform things

00:59:48.350 --> 00:59:50.880
in a different way.

00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:52.380
So there's path number 1.

00:59:52.380 --> 00:59:53.820
Then there's path number 2.

00:59:53.820 --> 00:59:56.260
And there's huge number
of different paths

00:59:56.260 --> 00:59:59.990
that I can, in
principle, take in order

00:59:59.990 --> 01:00:04.720
to change between the
initial and final points

01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:08.540
by playing around with the
mechanical coordinates that

01:00:08.540 --> 01:00:10.190
describe the system.

01:00:10.190 --> 01:00:14.290
I always ensure that,
initially, I was in equilibrium,

01:00:14.290 --> 01:00:18.230
so I could know exactly what the
value of these parameters are.

01:00:18.230 --> 01:00:21.830
And finally, I wait until
I have reached equilibrium.

01:00:21.830 --> 01:00:25.050
So again, I know
what this things are.

01:00:25.050 --> 01:00:29.000
And I know what
mechanical work is.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.250
And I can calculate
along each one

01:00:31.250 --> 01:00:35.520
of these paths, the
net amount of work.

01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:37.392
The work is delivered
in different ways--

01:00:37.392 --> 01:00:39.350
through the magnetic
field, through the pulling

01:00:39.350 --> 01:00:41.530
of the spring, to the
hydrostatic pressure,

01:00:41.530 --> 01:00:44.180
et cetera-- but
ultimately, when I add up

01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:46.450
all of the increments
of the work,

01:00:46.450 --> 01:00:51.150
I will find that all of them
will give you the same delta

01:00:51.150 --> 01:00:56.180
W, irrespective of the path.

01:00:56.180 --> 01:00:57.410
OK.

01:00:57.410 --> 01:00:59.140
Now this reminds me
of the following,

01:00:59.140 --> 01:01:07.310
that if I'm rolling a
ball on top of a hill.

01:01:07.310 --> 01:01:09.410
And there is no friction.

01:01:09.410 --> 01:01:11.550
The amount of work
that I do in order

01:01:11.550 --> 01:01:15.450
to take it from here to here,
irrespective of the path

01:01:15.450 --> 01:01:17.540
that I take on the
hill, it really

01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:20.380
is a function of the
difference in potential energy

01:01:20.380 --> 01:01:23.240
between the final
and initial points.

01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:26.610
So it's the same type of thing.

01:01:26.610 --> 01:01:31.520
Rather than moving these
coordinates on a hill,

01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:35.740
I am moving them in
this set of parameters

01:01:35.740 --> 01:01:38.100
that thermodynamically
describe the system,

01:01:38.100 --> 01:01:40.120
but I see the same
thing that I would

01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:45.080
see in the absence of friction
for rolling a ball of the hill.

01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:47.290
And immediately, I
would deduce here

01:01:47.290 --> 01:01:49.690
that there is this
potential energy,

01:01:49.690 --> 01:01:51.720
and the amount of
work that I have

01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:53.820
to do to roll this off
the hill is the difference

01:01:53.820 --> 01:01:57.330
between the potential energy
between the two points.

01:01:57.330 --> 01:02:02.260
So here, similarly, I would
say that this delta W--

01:02:02.260 --> 01:02:07.890
I define it to be the difference
between some function that

01:02:07.890 --> 01:02:11.430
is called the internal
energy-- that depends

01:02:11.430 --> 01:02:13.440
on the final set of coordinates.

01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:15.980
And there's a whole
bunch of them.

01:02:15.980 --> 01:02:18.390
Think of them in some
pictorial context.

01:02:18.390 --> 01:02:21.560
Minus what you have initially.

01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:31.790
So in the same sense that
the zeroth law allowed

01:02:31.790 --> 01:02:36.940
me to construct some
function of coordinates that

01:02:36.940 --> 01:02:39.910
was relevant to
thermal equilibrium,

01:02:39.910 --> 01:02:43.910
the first law allows me
to define another function

01:02:43.910 --> 01:02:46.165
of coordinates, which
is this internal energy.

01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:56.870
Of course, the internal energy
is the remnant of the energy

01:02:56.870 --> 01:02:59.030
that we know in
mechanical systems

01:02:59.030 --> 01:03:00.830
to be conserved quantity.

01:03:00.830 --> 01:03:02.750
And this is the
statement of fact.

01:03:02.750 --> 01:03:07.110
So far, nothing surprising.

01:03:07.110 --> 01:03:10.920
Now the real content
of the first law

01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:13.620
is when we violate
this condition.

01:03:13.620 --> 01:03:20.290
So essentially, what we do is
we replace the adiabatic walls

01:03:20.290 --> 01:03:30.850
that were surrounding our
very same system with walls

01:03:30.850 --> 01:03:34.640
that allow the exchange of heat.

01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:38.690
And I do exactly the
same set of changes.

01:03:38.690 --> 01:03:41.410
So maybe in one
case I stretch this,

01:03:41.410 --> 01:03:43.310
and then I change the
volume, et cetera.

01:03:43.310 --> 01:03:46.500
I do exactly the
same set of changes

01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:50.160
that I did in this case,
I try to repeat them

01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:52.840
in the presence of
diathermic walls,

01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:57.430
go from the same initial
state to the same final state.

01:03:57.430 --> 01:03:59.020
So the initial
state is the same.

01:03:59.020 --> 01:04:02.220
The final state, I
postulate to be the same.

01:04:02.220 --> 01:04:05.990
And what is observed
is that, in this case,

01:04:05.990 --> 01:04:14.860
the diathermic walls--
which allow heat exchange--

01:04:14.860 --> 01:04:18.170
that the amount of work
that you have to do

01:04:18.170 --> 01:04:22.280
is not equal to the
change in internal energy.

01:04:25.684 --> 01:04:26.184
OK?

01:04:30.100 --> 01:04:37.460
Now you really believe that
energy is a good quantity.

01:04:37.460 --> 01:04:42.260
And so at this stage, you
make a postulate, if you like,

01:04:42.260 --> 01:04:45.690
it's the part of the corollary
of the first law that

01:04:45.690 --> 01:04:48.850
allows you to define
exactly what heat is.

01:04:48.850 --> 01:04:51.740
So you're gradually defining
all of the things that

01:04:51.740 --> 01:04:55.310
were missing in the
original formulation.

01:04:55.310 --> 01:05:03.340
You define this heat
input to the system

01:05:03.340 --> 01:05:13.270
to be the difference in
energy that you expected,

01:05:13.270 --> 01:05:15.570
minus the amount
of work that you

01:05:15.570 --> 01:05:19.920
did in the presence
of these walls.

01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:21.820
OK?

01:05:21.820 --> 01:05:22.560
Yes?

01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:26.506
AUDIENCE: If we need the first
law to the point of heat--

01:05:26.506 --> 01:05:27.130
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:05:27.130 --> 01:05:31.542
AUDIENCE: --how did we define
[? adiabatic ?] used in--

01:05:31.542 --> 01:05:32.250
PROFESSOR: Right.

01:05:32.250 --> 01:05:35.270
AUDIENCE: --first law
and the zeroth law?

01:05:35.270 --> 01:05:37.860
PROFESSOR: As I said,
it's an idealization.

01:05:37.860 --> 01:05:40.270
So it's, in the same sense
that you can say well,

01:05:40.270 --> 01:05:43.600
how would you define
Newtonian mechanics

01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:47.310
that force is proportional to
mass times acceleration, what

01:05:47.310 --> 01:05:50.150
is the experimental
evidence for that?

01:05:50.150 --> 01:05:52.980
You can only do that really
when you go to vacuum.

01:05:52.980 --> 01:05:55.920
So what you can do
is you can gradually

01:05:55.920 --> 01:06:00.620
immerse your particle into
more and more dilute systems,

01:06:00.620 --> 01:06:03.910
and see what is the limiting
behavior in that sense.

01:06:03.910 --> 01:06:06.350
You can try to do
something similar here.

01:06:06.350 --> 01:06:08.610
You can imagine that
you put your system

01:06:08.610 --> 01:06:12.760
in some kind of a glass,
double glass, container,

01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:15.980
and you gradually pump
out all of the gas

01:06:15.980 --> 01:06:17.910
this is between the two of them.

01:06:17.910 --> 01:06:20.280
So that, ultimately,
you arrive at vacuum.

01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:22.080
You also have to
mirror things, so there

01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:24.760
is no radiation
exchange, et cetera.

01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:27.800
So gradually, you can try
to experimentally reach

01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:30.710
that idealization
and see what happens.

01:06:30.710 --> 01:06:33.220
But essentially, it
is certainly correct

01:06:33.220 --> 01:06:36.630
that any statement that I
make about adiabatic walls

01:06:36.630 --> 01:06:37.900
is an isolation.

01:06:37.900 --> 01:06:40.202
But it's an isolation
in the same sense

01:06:40.202 --> 01:06:41.660
that when you think
about the point

01:06:41.660 --> 01:06:42.910
particle in Newton's laws.

01:06:48.881 --> 01:06:49.380
OK?

01:06:57.540 --> 01:06:59.830
Let's go a little bit
further with this.

01:07:09.490 --> 01:07:23.260
So we have that in
differential form,

01:07:23.260 --> 01:07:29.310
if I go from one point
in coordinate space

01:07:29.310 --> 01:07:31.870
that describes the
system in equilibrium,

01:07:31.870 --> 01:07:34.660
where energy's defined
to a nearby point,

01:07:34.660 --> 01:07:38.700
I can calculate what the value
of the change in this energy

01:07:38.700 --> 01:07:40.070
function is.

01:07:40.070 --> 01:07:44.230
And I can say that
there is a quantity, dE,

01:07:44.230 --> 01:07:46.730
that depends on a whole
bunch of coordinates that

01:07:46.730 --> 01:07:47.530
define the system.

01:07:50.140 --> 01:07:54.730
And what the first law
says is that if you

01:07:54.730 --> 01:07:57.840
try to operationally make
this change from one point

01:07:57.840 --> 01:08:02.250
to another point, you have to
supply work through the system,

01:08:02.250 --> 01:08:05.820
or you have to supply
heat through the system.

01:08:05.820 --> 01:08:10.760
And we write them in this form.

01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:13.435
And what this D
and d bar-- and we

01:08:13.435 --> 01:08:19.000
will encounter this many times
in future also and define

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:22.020
them better-- is that E
is a function of state.

01:08:22.020 --> 01:08:25.380
It depends on where you are
in this parameter space.

01:08:25.380 --> 01:08:30.260
So in the same sense that maybe
you have a function of x and y,

01:08:30.260 --> 01:08:33.520
could be like x
squared plus 3x y,

01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:37.149
I can define what dE is
in terms of the x and y.

01:08:37.149 --> 01:08:40.890
So that's where I
have this quantity.

01:08:40.890 --> 01:08:45.979
But dW and dQ depend on
precisely how this system

01:08:45.979 --> 01:08:48.410
was made to go
from here to here.

01:08:48.410 --> 01:08:52.430
And you can sort of go between
how much contribution to dE

01:08:52.430 --> 01:08:55.569
comes from here or from
there, by certainly say,

01:08:55.569 --> 01:08:57.529
changing the
properties of the walls

01:08:57.529 --> 01:09:01.319
from being adiabatic to
being diathermal, et cetera.

01:09:01.319 --> 01:09:06.630
So these quantities really, as
opposed to this quantity that

01:09:06.630 --> 01:09:09.109
depends on stage,
these quantities

01:09:09.109 --> 01:09:12.084
depend on path, the
conditions by which you

01:09:12.084 --> 01:09:13.819
implement a particular change.

01:09:18.819 --> 01:09:23.870
Now there is a desire, and
it's very important for us

01:09:23.870 --> 01:09:27.569
to actually construct
what this function is.

01:09:27.569 --> 01:09:31.540
You want to, sort of, know
what the energy function

01:09:31.540 --> 01:09:33.600
for, let's say, a
mechanical system is.

01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:36.744
In a potential, you want
to know what the form of E

01:09:36.744 --> 01:09:39.439
is and then you can do
a lot of things with it.

01:09:39.439 --> 01:09:45.090
So how do we construct that
for our thermodynamics system?

01:09:45.090 --> 01:09:47.689
Again, we can
idealize things and go

01:09:47.689 --> 01:09:52.434
to processes that are
so-called, quasi-static.

01:09:59.690 --> 01:10:07.640
Which effectively means
slow, or slow enough,

01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:12.750
to maintain equilibrium.

01:10:15.850 --> 01:10:18.240
And the general
idea is, suppose I

01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:23.110
wanted to calculate what the
potential energy of a spring

01:10:23.110 --> 01:10:28.960
is, or what the potential energy
of a particle rolling on a hill

01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:34.290
is, well, one way that I could
do that is I could, let's say,

01:10:34.290 --> 01:10:39.180
pull on this sufficiently
slowly, so that as I'm pulling

01:10:39.180 --> 01:10:43.630
this by a certain amount,
the spring does not

01:10:43.630 --> 01:10:45.570
start to vibrate.

01:10:45.570 --> 01:10:48.890
And so the force that
I'm exerting externally,

01:10:48.890 --> 01:10:53.430
is really the force that
is internal to the spring.

01:10:53.430 --> 01:10:56.360
If I really push it
to rapidly, the spring

01:10:56.360 --> 01:10:58.090
will start to oscillate.

01:10:58.090 --> 01:11:01.370
There's really no relation
now between the external force

01:11:01.370 --> 01:11:04.300
that, let's say, is in uniform
value and the internal force

01:11:04.300 --> 01:11:05.810
that is oscillating.

01:11:05.810 --> 01:11:08.190
I don't want to do that
because when that happens

01:11:08.190 --> 01:11:11.760
I don't know where I am
in this coordinate space.

01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:13.970
I want to do things
sufficiently slowly

01:11:13.970 --> 01:11:17.500
so that I go from here
to here here-- every time

01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:23.220
I am on this plane that defines
my properties in equilibrium.

01:11:23.220 --> 01:11:26.630
If I do that, then I can
calculate the amount of work,

01:11:26.630 --> 01:11:32.850
and for the case
of the spring, it

01:11:32.850 --> 01:11:35.450
would be the force
times extension.

01:11:35.450 --> 01:11:37.370
And so we generalize
that, and we

01:11:37.370 --> 01:11:42.620
say that if I have multiple ways
of doing work on the system,

01:11:42.620 --> 01:11:45.560
there is the analog of
the change in length

01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:49.820
of the spring-- that is the
displacement of the spring,

01:11:49.820 --> 01:12:03.790
if you like-- multiplied by
some generalized force that

01:12:03.790 --> 01:12:05.179
is conjugate to that.

01:12:11.050 --> 01:12:15.850
And indeed,
mechanically, you would

01:12:15.850 --> 01:12:21.300
define the conjugate
variables by differentiation.

01:12:21.300 --> 01:12:23.830
So if you, for example,
know the potential energy

01:12:23.830 --> 01:12:26.250
of the spring as a
function of its length,

01:12:26.250 --> 01:12:29.420
you take a derivative and
you know what the force is.

01:12:29.420 --> 01:12:32.570
So this is essentially
writing that relationship

01:12:32.570 --> 01:12:35.230
for the case of the
spring, generalize

01:12:35.230 --> 01:12:37.280
to multiple coordinates.

01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:43.330
And we can make a table of
what these displacements are

01:12:43.330 --> 01:12:47.450
and the corresponding
coordinates for the types

01:12:47.450 --> 01:12:49.580
of systems that we are
likely to encounter.

01:13:01.150 --> 01:13:03.250
So what is x?

01:13:03.250 --> 01:13:05.220
What is j?

01:13:05.220 --> 01:13:08.010
And the first thing
that we mentioned

01:13:08.010 --> 01:13:10.620
was the case of the wire.

01:13:10.620 --> 01:13:14.860
And for the wire we can-- the
displacement of the length

01:13:14.860 --> 01:13:16.860
is important, and the
conjugate variable

01:13:16.860 --> 01:13:20.450
is the force with which
you are pulling on this.

01:13:20.450 --> 01:13:25.380
In the first problem set, you
will deal-- in the first test

01:13:25.380 --> 01:13:29.880
preparation, you will deal
with the case of film.

01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:33.856
And for the film, what you
do is you change the area,

01:13:33.856 --> 01:13:35.230
or if you have a
balloon, you can

01:13:35.230 --> 01:13:37.870
blow on the balloon, and the
surface area of the balloon

01:13:37.870 --> 01:13:38.860
changes.

01:13:38.860 --> 01:13:41.730
And there's a corresponding
conjugate variable

01:13:41.730 --> 01:13:44.405
to that which is called
the surface tension.

01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:52.150
This is essentially the same
thing, going from one dimension

01:13:52.150 --> 01:13:53.900
to two dimension.

01:13:53.900 --> 01:13:56.690
And if I were to go
one dimension higher,

01:13:56.690 --> 01:14:02.410
in the case of the gas, I
have the volume of the box.

01:14:02.410 --> 01:14:06.330
And I went through this
just for the notation

01:14:06.330 --> 01:14:09.620
that the hydrostatic
pressure of the work

01:14:09.620 --> 01:14:13.840
is defined to be
minus p w-- minus PBV.

01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:14.480
Sorry.

01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:20.050
pW is minus PVV, as opposed to,
say, the force of the spring,

01:14:20.050 --> 01:14:21.570
that is FDL.

01:14:21.570 --> 01:14:23.600
It's just, again,
matter of definition

01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:27.050
and how we define the
sign of the pressure.

01:14:27.050 --> 01:14:31.720
And for the case of the magnet
that we also briefly mentioned,

01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:34.850
we have here MDB.

01:14:34.850 --> 01:14:39.720
The one thing that you
can see is the trend

01:14:39.720 --> 01:14:43.020
that all of these
quantities, if you

01:14:43.020 --> 01:14:46.920
make the size of your system
twice as big, these quantities

01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:49.240
will get proportionately bigger.

01:14:49.240 --> 01:14:50.420
So they're called extensive.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:58.830
Whereas the force and all the
other quantities are intensive.

01:15:04.070 --> 01:15:08.540
So what we've established
is that if we focus only

01:15:08.540 --> 01:15:11.990
on these types of
transformations, that

01:15:11.990 --> 01:15:18.430
don't include heat, we can
relate the change in energy

01:15:18.430 --> 01:15:20.500
directly to dW.

01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:24.590
And the dW, we can write
as the sum over i Ji dxi.

01:15:28.290 --> 01:15:33.520
Now in order to really
get dE, in general,

01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:35.280
I have to add to this dQ.

01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:45.366
And so really the
question that we have is,

01:15:45.366 --> 01:15:50.480
is there some kind
of analog of dW

01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:54.130
that we can write down for dQ?

01:15:54.130 --> 01:15:58.250
And if you think about it,
if you have two springs that

01:15:58.250 --> 01:16:01.360
are in equilibrium, so
that the thing does not

01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:04.435
go one way or the other,
the force exerted from one

01:16:04.435 --> 01:16:07.190
is the same as the force
exerted on the other.

01:16:07.190 --> 01:16:10.490
So in equilibrium, mechanical
equilibrium forces,

01:16:10.490 --> 01:16:14.100
pressures, et cetera,
are generally the same.

01:16:14.100 --> 01:16:17.340
And we've established that when
you are in thermal equilibrium,

01:16:17.340 --> 01:16:19.550
temperatures are the same.

01:16:19.550 --> 01:16:23.840
So we have a very good
guess that we should really

01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:27.640
have temperature appearing here.

01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:31.020
And then the question that
we'll sort of build on

01:16:31.020 --> 01:16:33.720
is what is the analog
of the quantity

01:16:33.720 --> 01:16:34.998
that we have to put here.

01:16:44.090 --> 01:16:50.760
Let me finish by telling
you one other story that

01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:53.600
is related to the ideal gas.

01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:56.840
I said that for every
one of these laws,

01:16:56.840 --> 01:17:02.460
we can kind of come up with
a peculiar feature that

01:17:02.460 --> 01:17:05.330
is unique to the case
of the ideal gas.

01:17:05.330 --> 01:17:08.460
And there is a property
related to its energy

01:17:08.460 --> 01:17:11.610
that we will shortly explore.

01:17:11.610 --> 01:17:16.970
But let me first say what the
consequence of these kinds

01:17:16.970 --> 01:17:20.450
of relations for
measurable quantities

01:17:20.450 --> 01:17:24.650
that we can already
try to deduce are.

01:17:24.650 --> 01:17:30.800
So one thing that you
can relate to heat,

01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:35.855
and properties of particular
material, is the heat capacity.

01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:43.720
So what you can do is you
can take your material

01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:48.670
and put some amount
of heat into it.

01:17:48.670 --> 01:17:52.050
And ask, what is the
corresponding change

01:17:52.050 --> 01:17:54.087
in temperature?

01:17:54.087 --> 01:17:55.420
That would be the heat capacity.

01:17:58.050 --> 01:18:02.050
Now this bar that
we have over here,

01:18:02.050 --> 01:18:09.420
tells me that this quantity--
which we will denote on C--

01:18:09.420 --> 01:18:16.460
will depend on the path
through which the heat is

01:18:16.460 --> 01:18:17.910
added to the system.

01:18:17.910 --> 01:18:22.760
Because we've established that,
depending on how you add heat

01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:25.140
to the system, the
change that you

01:18:25.140 --> 01:18:28.410
have in the coordinate
space is going

01:18:28.410 --> 01:18:30.220
to be distinct potentially.

01:18:30.220 --> 01:18:32.220
Actually, we establish
the other way

01:18:32.220 --> 01:18:35.300
that for a given change
in the coordinate system,

01:18:35.300 --> 01:18:37.340
the amount of the
Q depends on path,

01:18:37.340 --> 01:18:40.370
so they're kind of
equivalent statements.

01:18:40.370 --> 01:18:49.880
So if I'm dealing with a gas,
I can add the heat to it,

01:18:49.880 --> 01:18:52.780
at least among many
other possibilities,

01:18:52.780 --> 01:18:54.590
in two distinct ways.

01:18:54.590 --> 01:19:01.190
I can do this at constant
volume or at constant pressure.

01:19:01.190 --> 01:19:05.030
So if I think about
the coordinate space

01:19:05.030 --> 01:19:08.800
of the gas, which
is PV, and I start

01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:11.720
from some particular
point, I can either

01:19:11.720 --> 01:19:14.420
go along a path like
this, or I can go along

01:19:14.420 --> 01:19:17.630
the path like this, depending
on which one of these quantities

01:19:17.630 --> 01:19:20.310
I keep fixed.

01:19:20.310 --> 01:19:25.060
So then in one
case what I need is

01:19:25.060 --> 01:19:29.650
the change in Q
at constant v, dT.

01:19:29.650 --> 01:19:33.078
In the other case, this
change in Q, a constant P, dT.

01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:39.220
Now a consequence
of the first law

01:19:39.220 --> 01:19:48.735
is that I know that dQ's
are related to dE minus dW.

01:19:48.735 --> 01:19:52.870
And dW for the gas is minus PdV.

01:19:52.870 --> 01:19:56.030
So I can write it
in this fashion.

01:19:56.030 --> 01:20:00.760
Divided by dT, and in one
case, done at constant V,

01:20:00.760 --> 01:20:05.680
and in the other case,
done at constant p.

01:20:10.110 --> 01:20:12.620
The distinction
between these two paths

01:20:12.620 --> 01:20:18.090
immediately becomes clear,
because along the paths where

01:20:18.090 --> 01:20:21.500
the volume is kept
constant, there

01:20:21.500 --> 01:20:29.430
is no mechanical work that is
done along the this path, yes?

01:20:29.430 --> 01:20:32.470
And so this contribution is 0.

01:20:32.470 --> 01:20:35.360
And you have the
result that this

01:20:35.360 --> 01:20:39.960
is going to be related
to the change in energy

01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:43.270
with temperature at
constant V, whereas here you

01:20:43.270 --> 01:20:48.010
have the change in energy,
in temperature at constant P,

01:20:48.010 --> 01:20:53.426
plus P dV by dT at constant P.

01:20:53.426 --> 01:20:58.220
So there is some additional
manipulations of derivatives

01:20:58.220 --> 01:21:04.420
that is involved, but
rather than looking

01:21:04.420 --> 01:21:13.460
at that in the general case,
I will follow the consequence

01:21:13.460 --> 01:21:17.410
of that for a particular
example, which

01:21:17.410 --> 01:21:20.130
is ideal gas expansion.

01:21:27.070 --> 01:21:31.020
So as this is an observation
called Joule's experiment.

01:21:31.020 --> 01:21:36.140
I take a gas that is
adiabatically isolated

01:21:36.140 --> 01:21:38.010
from its environment.

01:21:38.010 --> 01:21:43.880
I connect it, also maintaining
adiabatic isolation

01:21:43.880 --> 01:21:45.880
to another chamber.

01:21:45.880 --> 01:21:49.070
And initially all
of the gas is here,

01:21:49.070 --> 01:21:51.920
and this chamber is empty.

01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:59.247
And then I remove this, and
the gas goes and occupies

01:21:59.247 --> 01:21:59.830
both chambers.

01:22:03.170 --> 01:22:06.570
Observation, there
is some temperature

01:22:06.570 --> 01:22:11.090
initially in this system
that I can measure.

01:22:11.090 --> 01:22:15.240
Finally, I can measure the
temperature of this system.

01:22:15.240 --> 01:22:17.522
And I find that the two
temperatures are the same.

01:22:24.610 --> 01:22:27.180
In this example,
since the whole thing

01:22:27.180 --> 01:22:32.080
was adiabatically
isolated, that the Q is 0.

01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:36.130
There is no mechanical work
that done on the system,

01:22:36.130 --> 01:22:41.260
so delta W is also 0.

01:22:41.260 --> 01:22:45.880
And since delta is
the same, I conclude

01:22:45.880 --> 01:22:53.880
that delta E is the
same for this two cases.

01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:56.840
Now, in principle,
E is a function

01:22:56.840 --> 01:23:00.500
of pressure and volume.

01:23:00.500 --> 01:23:04.590
And pressure and volume
certainly changed very much

01:23:04.590 --> 01:23:09.010
by going from that
place to another place.

01:23:09.010 --> 01:23:10.290
OK, so let's follow that.

01:23:10.290 --> 01:23:15.630
So E we said is a function
of pressure and volume.

01:23:15.630 --> 01:23:18.760
Now since I know that
for the ideal gas,

01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:21.530
the product of pressure
and volume is temperature,

01:23:21.530 --> 01:23:25.040
I can certainly exchange
one of these variables

01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:26.240
for temperature.

01:23:26.240 --> 01:23:28.000
So I can write,
let's say, pressure

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:31.790
to be proportional to
temperature over volume.

01:23:31.790 --> 01:23:34.720
And then rewrite
this as a function

01:23:34.720 --> 01:23:36.280
of temperature and volume.

01:23:39.400 --> 01:23:45.410
Now I know that in this
process the volume changed,

01:23:45.410 --> 01:23:48.500
but the temperature
did not change.

01:23:48.500 --> 01:23:52.390
And therefore, the internal
energy that did not change

01:23:52.390 --> 01:23:55.540
can only be a function
of temperature.

01:23:55.540 --> 01:23:58.840
So this Joule expansion
experiment immediately

01:23:58.840 --> 01:24:02.390
tells me that while internal
energy, in principle,

01:24:02.390 --> 01:24:05.570
is a function of P
and V, it is really

01:24:05.570 --> 01:24:07.590
a function of the
product of P and V,

01:24:07.590 --> 01:24:09.050
because the product
of P and V, we

01:24:09.050 --> 01:24:12.380
established to be
proportional to temperature.

01:24:12.380 --> 01:24:13.420
OK?

01:24:13.420 --> 01:24:17.340
So now if I go and look
at these expressions,

01:24:17.340 --> 01:24:21.830
I can see that these, dE by
dT, and irrespective of V and P

01:24:21.830 --> 01:24:25.660
is the same thing, because E
only depends on temperature.

01:24:25.660 --> 01:24:31.075
And since V is-- we know that PV
is proportional to temperature,

01:24:31.075 --> 01:24:37.950
a constant P, dV by dT
is the same as V over T.

01:24:37.950 --> 01:24:41.550
And so if I look at the
difference between those two

01:24:41.550 --> 01:24:46.470
expressions, what I find
is that this part cancels.

01:24:46.470 --> 01:24:52.520
This part gives me the value
of this product, PV over T,

01:24:52.520 --> 01:24:55.900
which we said is a constant.

01:24:55.900 --> 01:25:00.450
And it is certainly depends
on the amount of gas

01:25:00.450 --> 01:25:02.630
that you have.

01:25:02.630 --> 01:25:05.880
And so you can pick a
particular amount of gas.

01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:08.175
You can experimentally
verify this phenomenon,

01:25:08.175 --> 01:25:11.710
that the difference of heat
capacity along these two paths

01:25:11.710 --> 01:25:13.160
is a constant.

01:25:13.160 --> 01:25:17.880
That constant is the same
for the same amount of gas

01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:21.210
for different types of
argon, krypton, et cetera.

01:25:21.210 --> 01:25:24.030
And since it is
proportional, eventually

01:25:24.030 --> 01:25:28.000
to the amount of matter,
we will ultimately

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:32.520
see that it can be set to
be the number of particles

01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:36.770
making up the gas in some
constant of proportionality

01:25:36.770 --> 01:25:41.070
that we will identify later
in statistical physics

01:25:41.070 --> 01:25:42.920
is the Boltzmann
parameter, which

01:25:42.920 --> 01:25:49.257
is 1.43 times 10 to the
minus 23 or whatever it is.

01:25:53.240 --> 01:25:56.065
All of this depends
partly on the definition

01:25:56.065 --> 01:25:58.890
that you made of temperature.

01:25:58.890 --> 01:26:03.630
What we will do next
time is to review

01:26:03.630 --> 01:26:06.310
all of this, because I've went
through them a little bit more

01:26:06.310 --> 01:26:14.390
rapidly, and try to identify
what the conjugate variable is

01:26:14.390 --> 01:26:17.790
that we have to put
for temperature,

01:26:17.790 --> 01:26:22.380
so that we can write the form of
dE in a more symmetric fashion.

01:26:22.380 --> 01:26:23.889
Thank you.
