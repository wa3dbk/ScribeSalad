00:00:20.082 --> 00:00:21.040
PROFESSOR: Let's start.

00:00:23.962 --> 00:00:24.545
Any questions?

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:39.810
We've been gradually building
up thermodynamics, culminating

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:46.420
in what I call the most
important fundamental relation,

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:54.770
which was the E is
T dS plus Ji dxi.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.750
And essentially
we said that this

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.865
was some statement of
conservation of energy.

00:01:06.865 --> 00:01:11.250
where there's a heat component
that goes into the system,

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.310
and there's a work component.

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.530
And actually, we ended up
breaking the work component

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:26.100
into a mechanical part
and a chemical part,

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.580
which we wrote as
mu alpha dN alpha.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:36.170
I guess if I don't
write the sums,

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.640
the summation
convention is assumed.

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:48.460
Now, this gave us an idea of
what a thermodynamic system is,

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.380
in the sense of how many
coordinates do we need in order

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.010
to place the system
in equilibrium

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.530
somewhere in some
coordinate space.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.880
And we said that we can just
count the number of variables

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.090
that we have on this side.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.830
And indeed, for
the case of energy,

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:11.720
the natural set of variables
would be S, x, and N.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.650
And given some place in
the coordinate system that

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.490
is S, x, and N, you
could find a point that

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.946
corresponds to that
thermodynamic equilibrium

00:02:23.946 --> 00:02:24.445
state.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.830
Now, having gotten this
fundamental relation,

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.160
we can manipulate and write
it in different fashion.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.050
And in particular,
for example, you

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:48.000
can write the S is dE by
dT, minus Ji dxi over T,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:56.660
minus mu alpha dN alpha over
T. So you could in principle

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.670
express everything rather than
in terms of entropy-- which

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.500
in some circumstances may not
be the right variable-- in terms

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.010
of the energy content of
the system and the variables

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.030
that you need in order to
make work type of changes

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.070
on the system.

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.700
And we saw that other
versions of it is possible.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.350
So for example, we
could rearrange.

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.210
Rather than looking
at E, we could

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:28.630
look at E minus TS, the
quantity that we call F.

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.450
And then dF would look very
much like the original equation.

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.475
Rather than T dS, we
would get minus S dT.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.910
And clearly, for
this quantity F,

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:54.250
the natural variables
are T, x, and N.

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.140
And there were other
types of these functions

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.360
that we construct.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:07.810
So basically at this stage, we
have a formula that tells us

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.390
how to navigate our way
in this space of things

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.230
that are in equilibrium.

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:18.050
And by taking various
derivatives of equilibrium

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:19.870
functions with
respect to each other,

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.210
we can express other ones.

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.820
And via this methodology, we can
relate to many different things

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.310
to each other and have
mathematical relations

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.750
between physical observables.

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.020
So following up on
that, we then ask

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:43.030
what are some other mathematical
forms that we can look at.

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.770
And one set of forms
followed from extensivity.

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.150
And we saw that if we were
under circumstances such

00:04:53.150 --> 00:05:00.900
that we were to multiply all
of the extensive variables

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:05.280
by some factor-- 2, 3,
whatever-- and the energy

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:12.270
content would increase
by that same factor,

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:18.250
then we could in fact
integrate the equation

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:22.400
and drop the d's and
write it in this fashion--

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:30.393
TS Jx plus mu N, regarding
these as kind of vectors.

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:39.320
And importantly, that told us
that the intensive variables

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.830
were not independent
of each other.

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:52.980
And you had relationship that
you-- S dT plus Ji xi dJi

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:57.110
plus N alpha d mu alpha is 0.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:04.400
And last time, I
did one calculation

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.600
using this Gibbs-Duhem
relation that I repeat.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.150
And that was for a gas isotherm.

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.370
Isotherm corresponds
to dT goes to 0.

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:26.870
And the analogue of hydrostatic
work for a gas was minus P

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:32.840
for J. So this becomes
minus V dP plus N d mu.

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:36.560
If you have one
component, it goes to 0.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.090
And we said that this
gives us the relationship

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:42.520
along an isotherm.

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:53.260
So for a fixed T, d
mu by dP is V over N.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:54.970
I'll come back to that shortly.

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:03.760
Towards the end
of last lecture, I

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:06.300
mentioned that we
can get a number

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:15.920
of other so-called
Maxwell relations

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:21.960
by noting that mixed
second derivatives are

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:25.370
independent of the order
of taking derivatives.

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:33.780
So that if you have some df
of x and y written as df by dx

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:42.490
at constant y dx, plus df
by dy at constant x dy,

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:45.330
then the order of the
second derivatives, which

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:48.670
would be obtained
by taking either

00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:51.410
a derivative of the
first term with respect

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:54.440
to y or the second term
with respect to x--

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:55.750
doesn't matter which order.

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:10.870
So let's start with
our initial equation.

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:14.370
And for simplicity,
let's think of cases

00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:17.100
where we have a fixed
number of particles

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:25.597
so that we can write
dE as T dS plus Ji dxi.

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:34.190
So this looks like this dF
that I wrote before for you.

00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:45.350
And I can identify temperature
as dE by dS at constant x,

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:53.510
and each one of the forces Ji
as dE by dxi at constant S.

00:08:53.510 --> 00:09:02.470
And all of the J's that are
not equal to i kept fixed.

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:06.160
And then, since the
second derivative

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:10.880
is irrespective of order, I
can form the second derivative

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:17.440
with respect to the combination
S xi into a different fashion.

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:21.820
I can either take a derivative
over here-- I already

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:25.650
have derivative with
respect to S giving me T,

00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:36.440
so I will get dT by dxi,
essentially at constant S--

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:40.400
or I can take the
derivative of this object.

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:44.940
I already have the x derivative,
so I take the S derivative.

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:50.800
So I have dJi with respect
to S at constant x.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:10:02.275
So this is an example
of the Maxwell relation.

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:13.130
And just to remind
you, we can always

00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:15.820
invert these derivatives.

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:20.440
So I can invert this
and say that actually,

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:24.130
if I had wondered how
the entropy changes

00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:29.810
as a function of a force such
as pressure at constant x,

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:36.040
it would be related to how
the corresponding displacement

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:39.930
to the force changes as a
function of temperature.

00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:44.570
So you would have a relationship
between some observable

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:48.100
such as how the length
of a wire changes

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:50.880
if you change
temperature rapidly,

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:55.560
and how the entropy would change
as a function of pressure,

00:10:55.560 --> 00:11:00.340
or corresponding force,
whatever it may be.

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:07.220
Now, what I would like to
remind you is that the best

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:10.570
way to sort of derive
these relationships

00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:13.680
is to reconstruct
what kind of second

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:15.360
derivative or mixed
derivative you

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:19.370
want to have to give
you the right result.

00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:21.260
So for example, say
somebody told me

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:28.350
that I want to calculate
something similar-- dS by dJ,

00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:29.920
let's say at
constant temperature.

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:34.625
How do I calculate that?

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:41.700
A nice way to calculate
that is if I somehow

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:48.490
manipulate so that S appears
as a first derivative.

00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:53.900
Now, S does not appear as
a first derivative here,

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:57.180
but certainly appears as
a first derivative here.

00:11:57.180 --> 00:12:00.300
So who says I have to take
E as a function of state?

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:03.250
I can look at the
second derivative of F.

00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:08.870
So if I look at F,
which is E minus TS--

00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:10.830
and actually, I don't
even need to know

00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:15.140
what the name of this entity is,
whether it's F, G, et cetera.

00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:22.540
All I know is that it will
convert this to minus S dT--

00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:26.920
the TS that I don't want,
so that S appears now

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:30.120
as a first derivative.

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:33.130
Now I want to take a
derivative of S with respect

00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:42.370
to J. If I just stop here, the
next term that I would have

00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:43.305
is Ji dxi.

00:12:46.015 --> 00:12:50.820
And the natural way that I would
construct a second derivative

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:54.390
would give me dS
with respect to xi.

00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:57.185
But I want the S
with respect to Ji.

00:12:57.185 --> 00:13:00.650
So I say, OK, I'll do
this function instead.

00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:02.350
As I said, I don't
really care what

00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:04.570
the name of these functions is.

00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:06.830
This will get
converted to xi dJ.

00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:15.200
Now I can say there is
this first derivative-- d o

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:21.990
minus S with respect
to Ji at constant T

00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:27.990
is the same thing as d
of minus y with respect

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:42.110
to T at constant J. So I can
get rid of the minus sign

00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:44.700
if I want, and I have
the answer that I want.

00:13:44.700 --> 00:14:03.570
It is dxi by dT at constant
J-- at constant-- yeah, T-- J.

00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:06.410
And you can go and construct
anything else that you like.

00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:14.170
Let me, for example,
try to construct

00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:18.520
this entity we
already calculated.

00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:20.870
So let's see.

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:27.350
What can I say about d mu by
dP at constant temperature,

00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:35.230
and I want to calculate
that via a Maxwell relation?

00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:36.030
So what do I know?

00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:43.250
I know that dE is
T dS minus pdV.

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:45.130
Good.

00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:47.740
Oh, I want to have
mu in the play,

00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:49.520
so now I have to add mu dN.

00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:59.070
That's good, because I have
mu as a first derivative.

00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:01.600
I have it over here.

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:05.320
But I have P as a
first derivative,

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:09.740
whereas I want P to appear as
the work element, something

00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:11.550
like dP.

00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:18.530
So what I will do is I will
make this d of E plus pV.

00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:28.166
This converts this to
plus V dP plus mu dN.

00:15:28.166 --> 00:15:32.840
That's fine, except that
when I do things now,

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:36.440
I would have calculated
things at constant S.

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:39.420
And I want to calculate
things at constant T.

00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:40.870
That's not really important.

00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:45.660
I do a minus ST. This
becomes minus S dT.

00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:49.890
And then I have a
function of state--

00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:53.110
I don't care what
it's called-- that has

00:15:53.110 --> 00:16:00.910
the right format for me
to identify that d mu

00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:08.710
by dP at constant N and T,
along an isotherm of a fixed

00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:17.640
number of particles,
is the same thing as dV

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:28.970
by dN at constant PN T. So
that's my Maxwell relation.

00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:31.215
So why didn't I get this result?

00:16:35.576 --> 00:16:36.806
Did I make a mistake?

00:16:41.476 --> 00:16:43.464
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:43.464 --> 00:16:44.955
PROFESSOR: Louder.

00:16:44.955 --> 00:16:47.950
AUDIENCE: Is this valid
for extensive systems?

00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:50.440
PROFESSOR: Yes, this is
valid for extensive system.

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:54.860
I used extensively in
the relation of this.

00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:58.540
And here, I never
used extensivity.

00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:01.130
But if I have a system that
I tell you its pressure

00:17:01.130 --> 00:17:05.270
and temperature, how
is its volume related

00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:07.270
to the number of particles?

00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:09.280
I have a box in this room.

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:12.950
I tell you pressure and
temperature are fixed.

00:17:12.950 --> 00:17:16.750
If I make the box twice as big,
number of particles, volume

00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:18.169
will go twice as big.

00:17:18.169 --> 00:17:22.740
So if I were to
apply extensivity,

00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:25.665
I would have to conclude that
this is the same thing as V

00:17:25.665 --> 00:17:28.202
over N, and I would
be in agreement

00:17:28.202 --> 00:17:29.160
with what I had before.

00:17:35.262 --> 00:17:35.845
Any questions?

00:17:40.471 --> 00:17:40.970
Yes.

00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:43.136
AUDIENCE: What about the
constraint of constant PN T

00:17:43.136 --> 00:17:44.677
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:17:44.677 --> 00:17:45.260
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:47.570
Actually, constraint
of constant PN T

00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:50.700
is important because
we said that said there

00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:56.088
it is a kind of
Gibbs-Duhem relation.

00:17:56.088 --> 00:17:59.360
And the Gibbs-Duhem
relation tells me

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:13.252
for the case of the gas that
the S dT minus V dP plus N d mu

00:18:13.252 --> 00:18:14.860
is 0.

00:18:17.650 --> 00:18:19.920
And that constraint
is the one that

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:25.700
tells me that once you have
set P and T, which are the two

00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:30.820
variables that I have specified
here, you also know mu.

00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:35.150
That is, you know all
the intensive quantities.

00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:39.050
So once you set PN T-- the
constraints over there--

00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:40.800
really, the only thing
that you don't know

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:44.070
is how big the system is.

00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:46.620
And that's what's the condition
that I used over here.

00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:51.820
But it is only-- so
let me re-emphasize

00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:56.570
it this way-- I
will write dV by dN

00:18:56.570 --> 00:19:01.990
is the same thing as V over
N, only if I have PN T here.

00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:06.840
If I had here PN S, for example,
I wouldn't be able to use this.

00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:31.625
I was going to
build this equation

00:19:31.625 --> 00:19:34.472
to say, look at the
elements of this.

00:19:34.472 --> 00:19:38.530
This part we got
from the first law,

00:19:38.530 --> 00:19:43.010
the temperature we got
from the zeroth law,

00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:50.480
and this we got from the
second law, which is correct,

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:54.040
but it leaves out
something, which

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:58.820
is that what the second
law had was things

00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:01.890
going some particular direction.

00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:09.490
And in particular, we had
that for the certain changes

00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:19.680
that I won't repeat, the change
in entropy to be positive.

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:22.540
So when you are in
equilibrium, you

00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:27.750
have this relationship between
equilibrium state functions.

00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:30.430
But in fact, the second
law of thermodynamics

00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:34.320
tells you a little
bit more than that.

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:37.390
So the next item that
we are going to look at

00:20:37.390 --> 00:20:40.610
is, what are the
consequences of having

00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:44.240
underlying this equality
between functions

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:48.280
of state some kind of an
inequality about certain things

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:51.690
being possible and things
not being possible?

00:20:51.690 --> 00:20:54.119
And that relates to
stability conditions.

00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:10.190
And I find it easier to
again introduce to you these

00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:14.960
stability conditions by thinking
of a mechanical analogue.

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:26.950
So let's imagine that you
have some kind of a spring,

00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:32.240
and that this spring has some
kind of a potential energy

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:37.620
that I will call phi as a
function of the extension x.

00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:46.420
And let's say that it's
some non-linear function

00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:48.421
such as this.

00:21:48.421 --> 00:21:52.290
There is no reason why we
should use a hook and spring,

00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:53.460
but something like this.

00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:59.650
Now, we also discussed
last time what

00:21:59.650 --> 00:22:07.680
happens if I were to pull
on this with some force J.

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:09.640
So I pull on this.

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:12.780
As a result, presumably
it will no longer

00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:16.510
be sitting at x, because
what I need to do

00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:21.090
is to minimize something else--
the function that we call H--

00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:25.630
which was the potential
energy of the spring

00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:29.120
plus the entity that
was exerting the force.

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:32.500
So if I were to make it
in the vertical direction,

00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:35.680
you can imagine this as
being the potential energy

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:38.720
of the mass that was
pulling on the spring.

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:47.630
So what that means is
that in the presence of J,

00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:51.400
what I need to do is
to find the x that

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:52.790
minimizes this expression.

00:22:55.780 --> 00:23:05.500
Once essentially the kinetic
energy has disappeared,

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:09.950
my spring stops oscillating
and goes to a particular value.

00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:13.700
And mathematically,
that corresponds

00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:18.920
to subtracting a linear
function from this.

00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:21.270
Actually, what
will it look like?

00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:26.680
Let's not make this go flat,
but go up in some linear fashion

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:30.008
so that at least I can
draw something like this.

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:37.670
So what I need to do
is to minimize this.

00:23:37.670 --> 00:23:43.140
So I find that for
a given J, I have

00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:55.490
to solve d phi dx equals J.
But especially if you have

00:23:55.490 --> 00:24:00.306
a spring that has the kind of
potential that I drew for you,

00:24:00.306 --> 00:24:05.170
you start increasing
the-- so basically,

00:24:05.170 --> 00:24:08.460
what it says is that
you end up at the place

00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:13.260
where the slope is
equal to the derivative

00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:15.430
of the potential function.

00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:18.300
What happens if you start
increasing this slope,

00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:21.490
if it is a non-linear type
of thing, at some point

00:24:21.490 --> 00:24:24.050
you can see it's impossible.

00:24:24.050 --> 00:24:27.470
Essentially, it's like
a very flat noodle.

00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:31.950
You pull on it too much and then
it starts to expand forever.

00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:37.170
So essentially, this thing that
we are looking for a minimum,

00:24:37.170 --> 00:24:39.210
ultimately also
means that you need

00:24:39.210 --> 00:24:43.320
to have a condition on
the second derivative.

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:49.210
d2 phi by dx squared better
be positive actually,

00:24:49.210 --> 00:24:54.830
I have to take d2
H y dx squared.

00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:56.615
I took one derivative
to identify

00:24:56.615 --> 00:25:01.600
where the location of
the best solution is.

00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:03.590
If I take a second
derivative, this

00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:06.880
became essentially the
J. J is a constant.

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:11.080
It only depends on
the potential energy.

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:16.870
So it says independent of
the force that you apply.

00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:22.720
You know that if the shape of
the potential energy is given,

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:25.370
the only places
that are accessible

00:25:25.370 --> 00:25:27.690
are the kinds of
places where you

00:25:27.690 --> 00:25:30.080
take the second
derivative and the second

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:32.390
has a particular sign.

00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:36.900
So this portion of the
curve is in principle

00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:38.860
physically accessible.

00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:42.920
The portion that corresponds
to essentially changing

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:45.900
the curvature and going the
other way, there's no way,

00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:48.720
there's no force
that you can put

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:51.815
that would be able to access
those kinds of displacements.

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:59.040
So there is this
convexity condition.

00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:02.640
This was for one variable.

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:09.500
Now suppose you have multiple
variables-- x2, x3, et cetera.

00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:11.260
So you will have
the potential energy

00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:14.500
as a function of many variables.

00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:19.330
And the condition that you have
is that the second derivative

00:26:19.330 --> 00:26:26.450
of the potential with respect
to all variables, which forms--

00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:31.430
and if there are n variables,
this would be an n by n matrix.

00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:34.850
This matrix is
positive definite.

00:26:34.850 --> 00:26:37.710
What that means is
that if you think

00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:42.590
of this as defining for you
the bottom of a potential,

00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:46.710
in whatever direction
you go, this

00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:50.370
would describe the change
of potential for you.

00:26:50.370 --> 00:26:53.110
The first order
change you already

00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:58.490
set to 0 because of the force J.
The second order change better

00:26:58.490 --> 00:26:59.250
be positive.

00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:07.512
So this is the condition that
you would have for stability,

00:27:07.512 --> 00:27:08.720
quite generally mechanically.

00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:20.590
And again, this
came from the fact

00:27:20.590 --> 00:27:24.070
that if you were
to exert a force,

00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:27.240
you would change the energy
by something like J delta

00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:32.080
x, which is certainly the
same thing that we have here.

00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:39.140
This is just one component
that I have been focusing on.

00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:41.860
And so ultimately,
I'm going to try

00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:46.000
to generalize that to this form.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.510
But one thing that I don't
quite like in this form

00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:57.410
is that I'm focusing too
much on the displacements.

00:27:57.410 --> 00:28:01.350
This is written appropriately
using this form.

00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:04.900
And we have seen over
here that whether or not

00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:09.430
I express things in terms
of the displacements

00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:14.150
or in terms of entropy,
temperature, conjugate forces,

00:28:14.150 --> 00:28:16.890
et cetera, these are
all equivalent ways

00:28:16.890 --> 00:28:20.310
of describing the
equilibrium system.

00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:23.440
So I'm going to do a
slight manipulation of this

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:27.090
to make that symmetry between
forces and displacements

00:28:27.090 --> 00:28:29.020
apparent.

00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:31.350
So the generalization
of this expression

00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:35.060
that we have over
here is that once I

00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:38.010
know the potential
energy, the force

00:28:38.010 --> 00:28:41.620
in this multi-component
space is df by dxi.

00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:48.870
So in this multi-component
space, I have some J,

00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:52.310
and there's a corresponding x.

00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:54.950
They're related by this.

00:28:54.950 --> 00:29:00.710
Now, if I were to
make a change in J,

00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:04.370
there will be a change in the
position of the equilibrium.

00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:08.145
And I can get that by
doing a corresponding cange

00:29:08.145 --> 00:29:10.290
in the derivative.

00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:13.270
The corresponding
change in the derivative

00:29:13.270 --> 00:29:17.550
is the second derivative
of phi with respect

00:29:17.550 --> 00:29:29.470
to xi xj delta xj, sum
over J. So what I'm saying

00:29:29.470 --> 00:29:34.040
is that this is a
condition that relates

00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:37.760
the position to the forces.

00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:40.370
If I make a slight
change in the force,

00:29:40.370 --> 00:29:44.090
there will be a corresponding
slight change in the position.

00:29:44.090 --> 00:29:48.650
And the changes in the
position and the force given

00:29:48.650 --> 00:29:51.970
by this equilibrium condition
are related by this formula.

00:29:54.890 --> 00:30:00.370
Now, you can see that that
sum is already present here.

00:30:00.370 --> 00:30:02.650
So I can rewrite
the expression that

00:30:02.650 --> 00:30:07.310
is over here using that
formula as delta xi delta

00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:10.960
Ji, sum over i--
better be positive.

00:30:17.730 --> 00:30:23.260
So this expression is slightly
different and better way

00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:27.430
of writing essentially the same
convexity condition, stability

00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:29.930
condition, but in a
manner that treats

00:30:29.930 --> 00:30:33.710
the displacements and
the forces equivalently.

00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:41.230
And I'm going to
apply that to this

00:30:41.230 --> 00:30:44.320
and say that in
general, there will

00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:47.310
be more ways of
manipulating the energy

00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:51.360
of a thermodynamic system, and
that having the system reach

00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:59.890
to equilibrium requires
the generalization of this

00:30:59.890 --> 00:31:06.540
as a delta T delta S, plus
sum over i delta Ji delta xi,

00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:10.260
plus sum over alpha,
delta mu alpha,

00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:13.040
delta N alpha-- to be positive.

00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:26.620
And you may say I didn't
really derive this for you

00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:31.120
because I started from
mechanical equilibrium

00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:33.370
and stability condition
and generalized

00:31:33.370 --> 00:31:35.680
to the thermodynamic one.

00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:43.220
But really, if you go back
and I use this condition

00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:48.140
and do manipulations that
are compatible to this,

00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:52.800
you will come up with exactly
this stability condition.

00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:54.740
And I have that in the notes.

00:31:54.740 --> 00:31:58.410
It is somewhat more
mathematically complicated

00:31:58.410 --> 00:32:00.590
than this, because the
derivatives involve

00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:03.720
additional factors
of 1 over T. And you

00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:06.680
have to do slightly more
work, but you will ultimately

00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:08.580
come with the same expression.

00:32:14.995 --> 00:32:15.495
OK?

00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:23.620
You say, why is that of any use?

00:32:26.290 --> 00:32:28.320
It is possible
that you've already

00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:32.276
seen a particular use
of this expression.

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:44.390
Let's look at the case
of a gas-- one component.

00:32:44.390 --> 00:32:46.710
You would say that the
condition that we have

00:32:46.710 --> 00:32:54.165
is that delta T delta S minus
delta P delta V plus delta mu

00:32:54.165 --> 00:32:57.100
delta N has to be positive.

00:33:02.030 --> 00:33:03.710
Let's even be simpler.

00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:07.320
Look at the case
where delta T is 0,

00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:11.850
delta N equals to 0, which
means that I have a fixed

00:33:11.850 --> 00:33:15.740
amount of gas at a
particular temperature.

00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:18.430
So I could have,
for example, a box

00:33:18.430 --> 00:33:20.670
in this room which
is in equilibrium

00:33:20.670 --> 00:33:24.260
at the same temperature as
the temperature of the room.

00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:27.260
But its volume I'm
allowed to adjust

00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:30.260
so that the pressure changes.

00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:34.990
So in that process, at a
particular temperature,

00:33:34.990 --> 00:33:42.385
I will be finding a particular
curve in the pressure volume

00:33:42.385 --> 00:33:42.885
space.

00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:50.710
And the reason that I
drew this particular way

00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:55.600
is because I have the condition
that minus dP dV better

00:33:55.600 --> 00:34:03.060
be positive, so that if I
have P as a function of V,

00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:13.690
then I know that dP
is dP by dV delta V.

00:34:13.690 --> 00:34:20.440
And if the product
dP dV is positive,

00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:26.620
then this derivative dP
by dV has to be negative.

00:34:26.620 --> 00:34:29.469
This has to be a
decreasing function.

00:34:29.469 --> 00:34:31.560
And another way
of saying that is

00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:41.090
that the compressibility--
kappa T, which is minus 1

00:34:41.090 --> 00:34:47.400
over V, the inverse of this
dV by dP at constant T--

00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:49.300
has to be positive.

00:34:56.620 --> 00:35:00.800
So this is a curve where
dP by dV is negative.

00:35:04.970 --> 00:35:06.060
Fine, you say.

00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:08.350
Nothing surprising about that.

00:35:08.350 --> 00:35:11.530
Well, it turns out that
if you cool the gas,

00:35:11.530 --> 00:35:14.070
the shape of this
isotherm can change.

00:35:14.070 --> 00:35:17.500
It can get started.

00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:20.580
And there is a critical
isotherm at which

00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:23.770
you see a condition such
as this, where there's

00:35:23.770 --> 00:35:30.000
a point where the curve
comes with 0 slope.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:33.700
So you say that for that
particular critical isotherm

00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:38.620
occurring at TC, if I were
to make this expansion,

00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:41.232
the first term in
this expansion is 0.

00:35:44.850 --> 00:35:48.090
You say, OK, let's continue and
write down the second term--

00:35:48.090 --> 00:35:53.950
1/2 d2 P by dV squared
at constant P times

00:35:53.950 --> 00:35:54.700
delta V squared.

00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:02.130
Now the problem is
that if I multiply this

00:36:02.130 --> 00:36:07.710
by delta V-- which would have
made this into delta V squared

00:36:07.710 --> 00:36:10.600
and then this into
delta V cubed--

00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:12.770
I have a problem
because delta V can

00:36:12.770 --> 00:36:14.600
be both positive or negative.

00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:17.610
I can go one direction
or the other direction.

00:36:17.610 --> 00:36:21.680
And a term that is a
cubic can change sign--

00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:24.500
can sometimes be positive,
can sometimes be negative,

00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:27.670
depending on the sign of that.

00:36:27.670 --> 00:36:31.750
And that is disallowed
by this condition.

00:36:31.750 --> 00:36:36.090
So that would say that if
an analytical expression

00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:41.550
for the expansion exists, the
second derivative has to be 0.

00:36:41.550 --> 00:36:44.900
And then you would have
to go to the next term-- d

00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:48.440
cubed P dV cubed.

00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:53.280
And then delta V-- you would
normally write delta V cubed,

00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:56.070
but then I've multiplied by
delta V on the other side.

00:36:56.070 --> 00:36:58.250
We'd have delta V to the fourth.

00:36:58.250 --> 00:37:01.970
Delta V to the fourth you would
say is definitely positive.

00:37:01.970 --> 00:37:04.970
Then I can get things done
by having to make sure

00:37:04.970 --> 00:37:08.810
that the third
derivative is negative.

00:37:08.810 --> 00:37:12.600
And you say, OK, exactly
what have you done here?

00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:14.620
What you have done
here is you've

00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:18.460
drawn a curve that
locally looks like a cubic

00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:20.240
with the appropriate sign.

00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:24.280
And so that's certainly
true that if you

00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:30.570
have an isotherm there the
compressibility diverges,

00:37:30.570 --> 00:37:34.100
you have a condition
on second derivatives.

00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:38.880
And you probably have used this
for calculating critical points

00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:41.620
of van der Waals
and other gases.

00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:44.390
And we will do that ourselves.

00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:49.280
But it's actually not the
right way to go about,

00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:52.860
because when you go and look
at things experimentally

00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:56.850
with sufficient detail, you find
that these curves at this point

00:37:56.850 --> 00:37:58.700
are not analytic.

00:37:58.700 --> 00:38:00.960
They don't admit a
Taylor expansion.

00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:03.660
So while this
condition is correct,

00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:06.590
that the shape should
be something like this,

00:38:06.590 --> 00:38:09.167
it is neither cubic
nor a fifth power,

00:38:09.167 --> 00:38:10.750
but some kind of a
non-analytic curve.

00:38:15.931 --> 00:38:18.770
AUDIENCE: Could you
repeat last statement?

00:38:18.770 --> 00:38:20.260
PROFESSOR: That
statement, in order

00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:22.280
to fully understand
and appreciate,

00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:24.220
you have to come
to next term, where

00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:26.150
we talk about phase transitions.

00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:28.820
But the statement
is that the shape

00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:33.000
of the function in the
vicinity of something like this

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:37.430
is delta P is
proportional to delta V

00:38:37.430 --> 00:38:42.420
to some other gamma that is
neither 3 nor 5 nor an integer.

00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:46.590
It is some number
that experimentally

00:38:46.590 --> 00:38:51.660
has been determined to be of
the order of, I don't know, 4.7.

00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:56.430
And why it is 4.7 you have to
do a lot of interesting field

00:38:56.430 --> 00:38:57.770
theory to understand.

00:38:57.770 --> 00:39:01.424
And hopefully, you'll come next
semester and I'll explain it.

00:39:01.424 --> 00:39:06.680
AUDIENCE: So your point is
that gamma is not [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:11.460
PROFESSOR: Gamma is not-- so
the statement is, in order

00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:18.470
for me to write this
curve as something delta V

00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:21.060
plus some other thing--
delta V Squared--

00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:25.320
plus some other
thing-- delta V cubed--

00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:29.610
which we do all the time,
there is an inherent assumption

00:39:29.610 --> 00:39:34.090
that an analytical expansion
is possible around this point.

00:39:34.090 --> 00:39:40.255
Whereas if I gave you a
function y that is x to the 5/3,

00:39:40.255 --> 00:39:44.126
around x of 0, you cannot
write a Taylor series for it.

00:39:51.541 --> 00:39:52.040
OK?

00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:10.470
Essentially, this
stability condition

00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:15.820
tells you a lot of things about
signs of response functions.

00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:18.590
In the case of
mechanical cases, it

00:40:18.590 --> 00:40:21.160
is really that if
you have a spring,

00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:27.860
you better have a force
constant that is positive,

00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:31.630
so that when you pull on it,
the change in displacement

00:40:31.630 --> 00:40:33.840
has the right sign.

00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:36.050
It wants to be contracted.

00:40:36.050 --> 00:40:39.050
And similarly here,
you are essentially

00:40:39.050 --> 00:40:40.820
compressing the gas.

00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:46.890
There's a thermal analogue of
that sine which is worth making

00:40:46.890 --> 00:40:48.690
sure we know.

00:40:48.690 --> 00:40:51.500
Let's look at the
case where we have

00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:52.895
a fixed number of particles.

00:40:56.620 --> 00:41:02.480
And then what we would
have is that our dE

00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:07.940
is T dS plus Ji dxi.

00:41:11.250 --> 00:41:17.100
I am free to choose
any set of variables.

00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:20.760
The interesting set of
variables-- well, OK.

00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:29.550
So then stability implies
that delta T delta

00:41:29.550 --> 00:41:36.500
S plus delta Ji delta xi with
the sum over i is positive.

00:41:39.390 --> 00:41:41.640
Now, I can take a look
at this expression

00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:46.120
and choose any set of variables
to express these changes

00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:47.176
in terms of.

00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:58.300
So I'm going to choose for my
variables temperature and xi.

00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:01.750
You see, the way that
I've written it here,

00:42:01.750 --> 00:42:06.810
S, T, J, x appear
completely equivalently.

00:42:06.810 --> 00:42:08.720
I could have chosen
to express things

00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:15.900
in terms of S and
J, T and J, S and x.

00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:18.215
But I choose to use T and x.

00:42:20.890 --> 00:42:22.440
All right, so what
does that mean?

00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:28.258
It means that I write my
delta S in terms of dS

00:42:28.258 --> 00:42:38.180
by dT at constant x dT,
plus dS by dxi at constant T

00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:42.910
and other xj not
equal to i, delta xi.

00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:51.960
I also need an expression
for delta Ji here.

00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:58.620
so my delta Ji
would be dJi by dT

00:42:58.620 --> 00:43:05.810
at constant x, delta T,
plus dJi with respect

00:43:05.810 --> 00:43:12.100
to xj at constant T, an
appropriate set of J's,

00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:18.450
delta xi-- delta xj.

00:43:24.510 --> 00:43:26.000
Sum over J implicit here.

00:43:29.580 --> 00:43:34.320
I substitute these--
delta S and delta J--

00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:38.420
in the general form of
the stability condition

00:43:38.420 --> 00:43:43.440
to get constraints
applicable to combinations

00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:46.810
involving delta T and delta x.

00:43:46.810 --> 00:43:52.786
So I have to multiply
delta S with delta T.

00:43:52.786 --> 00:44:00.480
I have to multiply delta
Ji with delta xi here.

00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:00.980
Yes?

00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:04.330
AUDIENCE: So here,
J is not equal to i.

00:44:04.330 --> 00:44:07.940
And then which one is J?

00:44:07.940 --> 00:44:09.640
[INAUDIBLE]

00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:10.350
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:44:10.350 --> 00:44:18.920
So let's say that I have S
that is a function of-- I

00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:22.790
have x1 and x2.

00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:25.810
So here, I would
have derivatives

00:44:25.810 --> 00:44:29.970
dS by dx1 times delta x1.

00:44:29.970 --> 00:44:35.160
I would have derivatives
dS by dx2 times delta x2.

00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:37.960
In both cases, T is kept fixed.

00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:44.230
In this case, additionally,
x2 is kept fixed.

00:44:44.230 --> 00:44:47.780
In this case, additionally,
x1 is kept fixed.

00:44:47.780 --> 00:44:48.440
That's all.

00:44:54.490 --> 00:44:56.600
OK?

00:44:56.600 --> 00:44:58.570
So let's do that multiplication.

00:44:58.570 --> 00:45:05.450
We multiply a delta T here and
we get dS by dT at constant x,

00:45:05.450 --> 00:45:06.475
delta T squared.

00:45:09.350 --> 00:45:22.900
We get here a term which is
delta T delta xi, multiplying

00:45:22.900 --> 00:45:27.980
dS by dxi at constant
T, and the others

00:45:27.980 --> 00:45:31.320
that I don't bother to write.

00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:35.310
But I note that I will
get another term that

00:45:35.310 --> 00:45:44.160
is delta xi delta t from the
second term, whose coefficient

00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:51.080
is dJi by dT at constant x.

00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:53.100
And I group those
two terms together.

00:45:56.670 --> 00:46:01.610
And finally, we have
the last term here,

00:46:01.610 --> 00:46:17.450
which is delta xi delta
xj, dJi by dxj, constant T.

00:46:17.450 --> 00:46:23.040
And the constraint for all
of these stability conditions

00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:25.460
that I have written,
I have to be

00:46:25.460 --> 00:46:27.730
in the minimum of a potential.

00:46:27.730 --> 00:46:31.180
Any deviation that
I make better lead

00:46:31.180 --> 00:46:35.780
to an increase in this
combination, which

00:46:35.780 --> 00:46:39.000
is kind of equivalent
to being at the minimum

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.370
of some kind of
potential energy.

00:46:41.370 --> 00:46:43.150
If you do some
manipulations, this

00:46:43.150 --> 00:46:45.990
is also equivalent to
being at the maximum

00:46:45.990 --> 00:46:47.490
of some entropy function.

00:46:52.390 --> 00:47:00.950
Now, let's look at that
manipulation a little bit.

00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:03.800
Now, I happen to know
that this form will

00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:05.970
simplify a little bit.

00:47:05.970 --> 00:47:09.520
And that's why I chose this
combination of variables.

00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:13.240
And the simplification
that will happen

00:47:13.240 --> 00:47:17.390
is that this entity is 0.

00:47:17.390 --> 00:47:22.940
So let me show you
why that entity is 0.

00:47:22.940 --> 00:47:28.670
And that relies on one of
these Maxwell relationships

00:47:28.670 --> 00:47:30.160
that I had.

00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:33.170
So let's find the
Maxwell relation that

00:47:33.170 --> 00:47:39.710
is applicable to dS by
dxi at constant T, which

00:47:39.710 --> 00:47:40.890
is what I have over here.

00:47:43.430 --> 00:47:53.580
OK, let's again start with
dE being T dS plus ji dxi.

00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:55.220
I'm at fixed number
of particles.

00:47:55.220 --> 00:47:57.640
I don't need to write
the other term-- UDN.

00:48:00.410 --> 00:48:04.270
Unfortunately here, S is
not the first derivative.

00:48:04.270 --> 00:48:09.150
So what I will do is I
will look at E minus TS.

00:48:09.150 --> 00:48:12.170
That's going to turn
this into minus S dT.

00:48:14.890 --> 00:48:15.860
Good.

00:48:15.860 --> 00:48:20.370
Ji dxi is exactly what I want
because this will tell me

00:48:20.370 --> 00:48:25.610
something about the
derivative in this fashion.

00:48:25.610 --> 00:48:36.230
dS by dxi at constant
T is equal to what?

00:48:36.230 --> 00:48:41.880
It's taking the things
in this fashion,

00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:48.700
which is dJi by
dT at constant x.

00:48:51.581 --> 00:48:52.080
Good.

00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:57.710
So I can see that the sum
total of these two terms is 0.

00:48:57.710 --> 00:49:00.880
And that's exactly
what I have here.

00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:03.670
So this is 0 by
Maxwell relation.

00:49:35.090 --> 00:49:35.590
OK?

00:49:35.590 --> 00:49:36.810
OK

00:49:36.810 --> 00:49:42.310
So having set that to
0, I have two terms.

00:49:42.310 --> 00:49:49.360
One of them is this entity
that goes with delta T squared.

00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:55.710
And the other is this entity--
sum over i and J, delta xi,

00:49:55.710 --> 00:50:03.650
delta xj, dJi, dxj,
constant T. And this--

00:50:03.650 --> 00:50:11.210
for any choice of delta x's
and delta T's-- for any choice,

00:50:11.210 --> 00:50:12.850
it better be positive.

00:50:15.470 --> 00:50:18.840
So in particular,
given this nice form

00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:21.570
that I have over
here, I can certainly

00:50:21.570 --> 00:50:26.710
choose all of the delta x's
to be 0, because I do things

00:50:26.710 --> 00:50:31.710
at constant displacement.

00:50:31.710 --> 00:50:35.730
And then what I have
is that the whole thing

00:50:35.730 --> 00:50:41.290
is proportional to delta T
squared and some coefficient.

00:50:41.290 --> 00:50:43.958
So that coefficient
better be positive.

00:50:49.220 --> 00:50:53.500
So entropy should always
be an increasing function

00:50:53.500 --> 00:50:58.450
of temperature at
constant displacement.

00:50:58.450 --> 00:51:03.380
And the consequence of that is
that heat capacities measure

00:51:03.380 --> 00:51:06.290
at constant displacement.

00:51:06.290 --> 00:51:14.768
So this is the
heat capacity-- Cx.

00:51:14.768 --> 00:51:20.030
The general definition is
you put some amount of heat

00:51:20.030 --> 00:51:24.480
into the system at
constant displacement.

00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:27.680
So I have to specify
the procedure

00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:30.270
by which heat is
applied to the system

00:51:30.270 --> 00:51:36.710
and see how much this
temperature changes.

00:51:36.710 --> 00:51:39.870
I can in principle do this
sufficiently stability

00:51:39.870 --> 00:51:43.210
so I can measure precisely
the changes in temperature

00:51:43.210 --> 00:51:44.910
infinitesimally.

00:51:44.910 --> 00:51:47.670
And then I can use
the relationship

00:51:47.670 --> 00:51:54.310
between dQ and reversible
heat-- so dS at constant x dT.

00:51:56.830 --> 00:52:05.500
And dS by dT at constant
x is precisely the entity

00:52:05.500 --> 00:52:12.970
that we have looked
at-- to be positive.

00:52:17.170 --> 00:52:26.300
So in the same way that a spring
is stable-- if you pull on it,

00:52:26.300 --> 00:52:29.490
its extension should
increase a little bit.

00:52:29.490 --> 00:52:32.980
And so the coefficient
that relates

00:52:32.980 --> 00:52:35.680
the change in
displacement corresponding

00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:39.810
to the change in force has
to be positive for stability.

00:52:39.810 --> 00:52:44.840
Heat capacities must have
this positivity in the sense

00:52:44.840 --> 00:52:48.210
that if you add
heat to a system,

00:52:48.210 --> 00:52:52.310
its temperature should go up.

00:52:52.310 --> 00:52:56.710
It it went the other way, it
would actually also violate

00:52:56.710 --> 00:52:59.450
the second law of
thermodynamics.

00:52:59.450 --> 00:52:59.950
Yes?

00:52:59.950 --> 00:53:02.360
AUDIENCE: I'm a bit confused
about the J notation

00:53:02.360 --> 00:53:04.288
that we used.

00:53:04.288 --> 00:53:06.216
The initial equation
that we start

00:53:06.216 --> 00:53:13.990
has only-- it deals with i,
but where does J come from?

00:53:13.990 --> 00:53:16.860
PROFESSOR: This equation.

00:53:16.860 --> 00:53:17.510
Which equation?

00:53:17.510 --> 00:53:20.450
Up here?

00:53:20.450 --> 00:53:24.290
AUDIENCE: So index J is
just a dummy variable?

00:53:27.170 --> 00:53:33.130
[INAUDIBLE] that dE
equals T dS equals Ji dSi.

00:53:33.130 --> 00:53:35.450
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:53:35.450 --> 00:53:35.950
Fine.

00:53:35.950 --> 00:53:40.050
So let's start from here.

00:53:40.050 --> 00:53:45.790
And part of the confusion is
that I'm not really consistent.

00:53:45.790 --> 00:53:50.700
Whenever I write an
index that is repeated,

00:53:50.700 --> 00:53:56.790
there is a so-called
summation convention

00:53:56.790 --> 00:53:59.760
that you may have seen
in quantum mechanics

00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:04.390
and other courses which
says that the index that

00:54:04.390 --> 00:54:07.230
is repeated twice
is summed over.

00:54:07.230 --> 00:54:12.600
So when I write ai bi, using
the summation convention, what

00:54:12.600 --> 00:54:19.565
I mean is, sum over all
possible values of i, ai, bi.

00:54:19.565 --> 00:54:22.490
So what I meant
here is that there

00:54:22.490 --> 00:54:26.250
may be multiple ways of
doing work on the system.

00:54:26.250 --> 00:54:28.600
So there could be pressure,
there could be spring,

00:54:28.600 --> 00:54:30.590
there could be magnetic work.

00:54:30.590 --> 00:54:35.070
And if I do mechanical
work on the system,

00:54:35.070 --> 00:54:38.910
the change in energy is the
sum total of all different ways

00:54:38.910 --> 00:54:41.830
to do mechanical
works, plus the heat

00:54:41.830 --> 00:54:43.750
that is supplied to the system.

00:54:43.750 --> 00:54:47.030
So that's statement number one.

00:54:47.030 --> 00:54:50.210
Now, I did something
else here, which

00:54:50.210 --> 00:54:54.050
is that when I take a derivative
of a function that depends

00:54:54.050 --> 00:54:59.630
on multiple variables-- so
f depends on x1, x2, x3,

00:54:59.630 --> 00:55:10.920
xn-- then if I look
at the change in this,

00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:14.050
any one of these
variables can change

00:55:14.050 --> 00:55:17.380
by an amount that is dxi.

00:55:17.380 --> 00:55:19.640
And if the second
variable changes,

00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:21.830
there is a corresponding
contribution,

00:55:21.830 --> 00:55:26.020
which is df with respect
to the second variable.

00:55:26.020 --> 00:55:30.050
And I have to add all of
these things together.

00:55:30.050 --> 00:55:35.410
So if I'm again
inconsistent, this

00:55:35.410 --> 00:55:39.200
is really what I
mean, that when you

00:55:39.200 --> 00:55:43.180
do a change in a function
of multiple variables,

00:55:43.180 --> 00:55:47.410
you would write it
as dxi, df by dxi.

00:55:47.410 --> 00:55:50.120
If you use the
summation convention,

00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:54.180
I have to really sum
over all possibilities.

00:55:54.180 --> 00:55:59.650
Now, suppose I took one of
these things, like df by dx3.

00:56:02.340 --> 00:56:05.290
So it's one of the
derivatives here.

00:56:05.290 --> 00:56:08.910
And I took another derivative,
or I looked at the change

00:56:08.910 --> 00:56:10.670
in this function.

00:56:10.670 --> 00:56:15.470
This function depends also
on variables x1 through xn.

00:56:15.470 --> 00:56:22.700
So I have to look at the sum
over all changes with respect

00:56:22.700 --> 00:56:28.350
to xj of df by dx3 delta xj.

00:56:30.960 --> 00:56:36.230
So you can see that
automatically, I

00:56:36.230 --> 00:56:38.620
have kind of assumed
some of these things

00:56:38.620 --> 00:56:42.320
as I write things rapidly.

00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:49.200
And if it is not clear, you have
to spend a little bit of time

00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:53.850
writing things more in
detail, because it's

00:56:53.850 --> 00:56:56.550
after all kind of
simple algebra.

00:56:56.550 --> 00:56:58.507
Yes, did I make another mistake?

00:56:58.507 --> 00:56:59.006
Yes?

00:56:59.006 --> 00:57:00.880
AUDIENCE: Oh, not
a mistake, just--

00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:01.587
PROFESSOR: Yes?

00:57:01.587 --> 00:57:03.670
AUDIENCE: When you were
talking about mechanicals,

00:57:03.670 --> 00:57:05.005
you had a non-linear spring.

00:57:05.005 --> 00:57:06.954
You start pulling on it.

00:57:06.954 --> 00:57:09.120
At some point, it
just increases.

00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:12.188
PROFESSOR: If it is a non-linear
spring, yes, that's right.

00:57:12.188 --> 00:57:15.082
AUDIENCE: Can you provide
example of thermodynamic system

00:57:15.082 --> 00:57:21.262
which, upon some
threshold action upon it,

00:57:21.262 --> 00:57:21.970
becomes unstable?

00:57:38.910 --> 00:57:41.550
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:57:41.550 --> 00:57:44.540
I think I more or
less had that example.

00:57:44.540 --> 00:57:47.800
Let's try to develop it
a little bit further.

00:57:47.800 --> 00:57:54.665
So I said that typically, if
I look at the pressure volume

00:57:54.665 --> 00:57:58.705
isotherms of a gas, it
looks something like this.

00:58:01.480 --> 00:58:04.870
And I told you that
there is actually

00:58:04.870 --> 00:58:11.140
some kind of a critical isotherm
that looks something like this.

00:58:11.140 --> 00:58:12.950
And you may ask,
well, what do things

00:58:12.950 --> 00:58:16.900
look below that for
lower temperatures?

00:58:16.900 --> 00:58:19.180
And again, you
probably know this,

00:58:19.180 --> 00:58:21.310
is that this is the
temperature below which

00:58:21.310 --> 00:58:27.600
you have a transition to
liquid gas coexistence.

00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:31.090
And so the isotherms
would look like that.

00:58:31.090 --> 00:58:35.850
Now, it turns out that while
these are true equilibrium

00:58:35.850 --> 00:58:39.830
things-- you would have
to wait sufficiently long

00:58:39.830 --> 00:58:44.140
so that the system
explores these isotherms--

00:58:44.140 --> 00:58:47.590
it is also possible
in certain systems

00:58:47.590 --> 00:58:50.340
to do things a little
bit more rapidly.

00:58:50.340 --> 00:58:53.810
And then when you
go below, you will

00:58:53.810 --> 00:58:59.010
see a kind of remnant of that
isotherm which kind of looks

00:58:59.010 --> 00:58:59.620
like this.

00:59:02.700 --> 00:59:09.450
So that isotherm would
have portions of it

00:59:09.450 --> 00:59:17.600
that don't satisfy these
conditions of stability.

00:59:17.600 --> 00:59:21.170
And the reason that you still
get some remnant of it--

00:59:21.170 --> 00:59:22.430
not quite the entire thing.

00:59:22.430 --> 00:59:24.150
You get actually
some portion here,

00:59:24.150 --> 00:59:28.590
some portion here-- is because
you do things very rapidly

00:59:28.590 --> 00:59:31.110
and the system
does not have time

00:59:31.110 --> 00:59:33.910
to explore the
entire equilibrium.

00:59:33.910 --> 00:59:37.910
So that's one example
that I can think

00:59:37.910 --> 00:59:40.920
of where some remnants
of something that

00:59:40.920 --> 00:59:47.060
is like that non-linear
noodle takes place.

00:59:47.060 --> 00:59:49.665
But even the non-linear
noodle, you cannot really see

00:59:49.665 --> 00:59:50.570
in equilibrium.

00:59:50.570 --> 00:59:53.140
You can only see it
when you're pulling it.

00:59:53.140 --> 00:59:55.710
And you can see that
it is being extended.

00:59:55.710 --> 00:59:59.430
There is no equilibrium that
you can see that has that.

00:59:59.430 --> 01:00:04.070
So if I want to find an analogue
of that non-linear noodle

01:00:04.070 --> 01:00:09.250
showing instability, I'd better
find some near-equilibrium

01:00:09.250 --> 01:00:10.145
condition.

01:00:10.145 --> 01:00:12.770
And this is the near-equilibrium
condition that I can think of.

01:00:19.620 --> 01:00:22.920
There are a number of cases.

01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:29.010
And essentially, you've
probably heard hysteresis

01:00:29.010 --> 01:00:32.230
in magnets and things like that.

01:00:32.230 --> 01:00:35.250
And by definition,
hysteresis means

01:00:35.250 --> 01:00:38.970
that for the same
set of conditions,

01:00:38.970 --> 01:00:42.630
you see multiple
different states.

01:00:42.630 --> 01:00:46.200
So not both of them can
be or multiple of them

01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:48.020
can be in equilibrium.

01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:50.270
And over some
sufficient time scale,

01:00:50.270 --> 01:00:53.520
you would go from one
behavior to another behavior.

01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:58.310
But if you explore the vicinity
of the curves that correspond

01:00:58.310 --> 01:01:01.460
to these hysteretic
behavior, you

01:01:01.460 --> 01:01:05.160
would see the signatures
of these kinds

01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:07.120
of thermodynamic instabilities.

01:01:22.790 --> 01:01:25.530
There was one other part
of this that maybe I

01:01:25.530 --> 01:01:29.730
will write a little bit
in more detail, given

01:01:29.730 --> 01:01:30.750
the questions that were.

01:01:30.750 --> 01:01:40.260
Asked It is here I looked
at this general condition

01:01:40.260 --> 01:01:43.190
for the case where
the delta x's were 0.

01:01:45.810 --> 01:01:48.180
Let's look at the same
thing for the case

01:01:48.180 --> 01:01:52.490
where delta T equals
to 0, because then I

01:01:52.490 --> 01:02:02.470
have the condition that
the Ji by the xj, delta xi,

01:02:02.470 --> 01:02:05.240
delta xj should be positive.

01:02:08.150 --> 01:02:12.170
And this was done at constant T.

01:02:12.170 --> 01:02:20.380
And to be more explicit, there
is a sum over i and J in here.

01:02:24.190 --> 01:02:29.210
So if I'm doing things
at constant temperature,

01:02:29.210 --> 01:02:35.780
I really have the analogue
of the instability condition.

01:02:35.780 --> 01:02:42.370
What I have here, it is
the same thing as this one.

01:02:42.370 --> 01:02:48.780
And if you think about this
in a little bit more detail--

01:02:48.780 --> 01:02:52.250
let's say I have
something like a gas.

01:02:55.190 --> 01:02:58.730
We have two ways of
doing work on the system.

01:02:58.730 --> 01:03:01.460
I have dJ1 by dx1.

01:03:01.460 --> 01:03:04.245
I have dJ2 by dx2.

01:03:04.245 --> 01:03:07.610
I have dJ1 by dx2.

01:03:07.610 --> 01:03:10.820
I have dj2 by dx1.

01:03:10.820 --> 01:03:14.680
Essentially, this object,
there are four of them.

01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:20.830
And those four I can put
into something like this.

01:03:20.830 --> 01:03:24.210
And the statement
that I have written

01:03:24.210 --> 01:03:27.900
is that this 2 by
2 matrix, if it

01:03:27.900 --> 01:03:33.390
acts on the displacement delta
x1 delta x2 on the right,

01:03:33.390 --> 01:03:38.640
and then gets contracted on the
left by the same vector delta

01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:42.990
x1, delta x2, for any
choice of the vector delta

01:03:42.990 --> 01:03:48.030
x1 delta x2, this
better be positive.

01:03:48.030 --> 01:03:52.000
This is for two, but in
general, this expression

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.960
is going to be valid
for any number.

01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:06.190
Now, what are the constraints
that a matrix must satisfy

01:04:06.190 --> 01:04:10.490
so that irrespective of the
choice of this displacement,

01:04:10.490 --> 01:04:13.070
you will get a positive result?

01:04:13.070 --> 01:04:16.295
Mathematically, that's caused
a positive definite matrix.

01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:27.260
So one of the conditions that
is certainly immediately obvious

01:04:27.260 --> 01:04:32.470
is that if I choose the case
where delta x2 is 0, then

01:04:32.470 --> 01:04:34.710
the diagonal term
that corresponds

01:04:34.710 --> 01:04:38.020
to that entity
better be positive.

01:04:38.020 --> 01:04:41.780
So a matrix is positive
definite if for every one

01:04:41.780 --> 01:04:45.120
of the diagonal elements,
I have this condition.

01:04:49.490 --> 01:04:53.140
So this is actually something
that we already saw.

01:04:53.140 --> 01:04:55.110
In the case of the
gas, this would

01:04:55.110 --> 01:04:58.970
be something like minus dP by
dV at constant temperature--

01:04:58.970 --> 01:04:59.980
be positive.

01:04:59.980 --> 01:05:03.450
This is the nature of
these isotherms always

01:05:03.450 --> 01:05:07.395
going one way that
I was drawing.

01:05:07.395 --> 01:05:08.390
AUDIENCE: Question.

01:05:08.390 --> 01:05:09.360
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:12.720
AUDIENCE: You're not summing
over alpha now, are you?

01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:13.680
Or are you--

01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:14.970
PROFESSOR: Yes, I'm not.

01:05:14.970 --> 01:05:17.000
And I don't know how
to write. [LAUGHS]

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:20.660
Let's call it delta J1, x1.

01:05:24.130 --> 01:05:29.720
So all diagonal elements
must be positive,

01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:31.920
but that's not enough.

01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:36.640
So I can write a matrix that
has only positive elements

01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:40.920
along the diagonal, but
off-diagonal elements such

01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:43.610
that the combination
will give you

01:05:43.610 --> 01:05:49.210
negative values of
this culmination

01:05:49.210 --> 01:05:53.070
for appropriate choices
of delta x1 and delta x2.

01:05:53.070 --> 01:05:55.310
The thing that
you really need is

01:05:55.310 --> 01:06:03.226
that all eigenvalues
must be positive.

01:06:08.090 --> 01:06:12.720
It is not that easy to
write down mathematically

01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:18.000
in general what that means
in terms of multiple response

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:19.760
functions.

01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:23.620
That's why this
form of writing is

01:06:23.620 --> 01:06:25.510
much more compact and effective.

01:06:25.510 --> 01:06:29.490
It basically says, no matter
what combination of elements

01:06:29.490 --> 01:06:32.780
you choose, you are at the
bottom of the potential.

01:06:32.780 --> 01:06:35.310
You should not be able
to go away from it.

01:06:38.125 --> 01:06:39.616
AUDIENCE: So the
second statement

01:06:39.616 --> 01:06:42.610
is necessary and
sufficient condition?

01:06:42.610 --> 01:06:47.580
PROFESSOR: This statement is
necessary but not sufficient.

01:06:47.580 --> 01:06:50.810
This statement is
equivalent to the meaning

01:06:50.810 --> 01:06:53.230
of what is a positive
definite matrix.

01:06:53.230 --> 01:06:54.320
It is sufficient.

01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:55.510
Yes?

01:06:55.510 --> 01:06:58.080
AUDIENCE: Is there any
physical interpretation

01:06:58.080 --> 01:07:00.370
to diagonalizing that matrix?

01:07:04.750 --> 01:07:08.010
PROFESSOR: It depends on
the kind of the formations

01:07:08.010 --> 01:07:09.210
that you make.

01:07:09.210 --> 01:07:12.880
Like if I was really
thinking about a gas

01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:16.970
where I allow some exchange
with the surface or something

01:07:16.970 --> 01:07:21.310
else so that delta
N is not equal to 0,

01:07:21.310 --> 01:07:24.590
the general form of this
matrix in the case where

01:07:24.590 --> 01:07:27.280
I have pressure volume would
be something like this.

01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:29.860
I would have minus dP by dV.

01:07:29.860 --> 01:07:32.740
I would have d mu by dN.

01:07:32.740 --> 01:07:36.700
I would have dP by dN.

01:07:36.700 --> 01:07:40.360
I would have d mu by dV.

01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:45.500
And I would have to make sure
that this matrix is positive

01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:49.670
definite, so I know certainly
that the compressibility

01:07:49.670 --> 01:07:51.440
by itself has to be positive.

01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:54.720
d mu by dN also
has to be positive.

01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:57.820
But if I allow
changes both in volume

01:07:57.820 --> 01:08:00.590
and the number of
particles, then because

01:08:00.590 --> 01:08:04.720
of these off-diagonal terms,
I have additional constraints.

01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:07.080
So for appropriate
changes, it is

01:08:07.080 --> 01:08:10.180
sufficient to look at
the diagonal terms.

01:08:10.180 --> 01:08:14.786
But for the entire set of
possible transformations,

01:08:14.786 --> 01:08:17.800
it's not.

01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:19.572
Yes?

01:08:19.572 --> 01:08:22.893
AUDIENCE: If you look at
different ways to do the work

01:08:22.893 --> 01:08:25.760
on the system-- so in
this case, change volume,

01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:31.870
change number of particles,
if you're saying forces have

01:08:31.870 --> 01:08:36.609
different dimensions, and
if diagonalization of these

01:08:36.609 --> 01:08:41.010
metrics corresponds to inventing
some new ways of acting

01:08:41.010 --> 01:08:45.890
on the system which are a linear
combination of old ways like

01:08:45.890 --> 01:08:48.330
change volume a little
and change particles--

01:08:48.330 --> 01:08:51.810
PROFESSOR: Change the
number of particles, yes.

01:08:51.810 --> 01:08:56.020
AUDIENCE: Those are pretty
weird manipulations,

01:08:56.020 --> 01:08:58.760
in terms of how to
physically explain

01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:00.747
what is diagonalization matrix.

01:09:00.747 --> 01:09:01.330
PROFESSOR: OK.

01:09:04.330 --> 01:09:06.220
There is a question
of dimensions,

01:09:06.220 --> 01:09:07.930
and there's a
question of amount.

01:09:07.930 --> 01:09:09.630
So maybe what you
are worried about

01:09:09.630 --> 01:09:16.140
is that if I make one them
volume and the other pressure,

01:09:16.140 --> 01:09:18.399
one is extensive,
one is intensive,

01:09:18.399 --> 01:09:20.090
and the response
functions would have

01:09:20.090 --> 01:09:23.689
to carry something that
is proportional to size.

01:09:23.689 --> 01:09:25.439
But then there are
other conditions,

01:09:25.439 --> 01:09:28.710
let's say, where all of the
variables are intensive.

01:09:28.710 --> 01:09:31.939
And then it's moving
around in the space that

01:09:31.939 --> 01:09:36.060
is characterized, let's say, by
pressure and chemical potential

01:09:36.060 --> 01:09:38.560
from one point to another point.

01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:43.620
And there is some generalized
response that you would have,

01:09:43.620 --> 01:09:46.100
depending on which
direction you go to.

01:09:46.100 --> 01:09:48.810
So essentially,
I could certainly

01:09:48.810 --> 01:09:52.640
characterize various
thermodynamic functions

01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:55.050
in this space P mu.

01:09:55.050 --> 01:10:00.720
And what I know is that I cannot
write any function in this

01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:04.140
two-parameter space that
would be consistent with

01:10:04.140 --> 01:10:07.460
the thermodynamic
principles of stability.

01:10:07.460 --> 01:10:12.110
I have to have some
kind of convexity.

01:10:12.110 --> 01:10:16.070
So certainly, what
typically-- let's say again,

01:10:16.070 --> 01:10:21.070
going back to my favorite
example here-- what people do

01:10:21.070 --> 01:10:25.020
and what we will
do later on is we

01:10:25.020 --> 01:10:29.650
specify that you have
some particular pressure

01:10:29.650 --> 01:10:33.370
and volume of an
interacting gas.

01:10:33.370 --> 01:10:35.810
And there is no way
that we can calculate

01:10:35.810 --> 01:10:41.080
the thermodynamic properties
of that system exactly.

01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:43.640
We try to construct
a free energy

01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:47.250
as a function of
these variables.

01:10:47.250 --> 01:10:50.900
And that free energy
will be approximate based

01:10:50.900 --> 01:10:52.630
on some ideas.

01:10:52.630 --> 01:10:58.650
And then we will see that that
free energy that I construct

01:10:58.650 --> 01:11:04.390
in some places will violate
the conditions of stability.

01:11:04.390 --> 01:11:08.280
And then I know that that free
energy that I constructed,

01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:12.930
let's say on the assumption
that the box that I have

01:11:12.930 --> 01:11:16.520
is uniformly covered
by some material,

01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:18.500
that assumption is violated.

01:11:18.500 --> 01:11:21.105
And maybe what has happened
is that part of the volume

01:11:21.105 --> 01:11:24.310
is a liquid and part
of the volume is gas.

01:11:24.310 --> 01:11:28.770
So we will do precisely
that exercise later on.

01:11:28.770 --> 01:11:31.080
We will choose a
pair of variables.

01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:36.750
We will try to construct a
free energy function out.

01:11:36.750 --> 01:11:40.590
We make the assumption that
the box is uniformly occupied

01:11:40.590 --> 01:11:42.490
with the gas at some density.

01:11:42.490 --> 01:11:46.230
Based on that, we estimate its
energy, entropy, et cetera.

01:11:46.230 --> 01:11:49.280
We construct a free
energy function out.

01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:54.810
And then we will see that
that energy function violates

01:11:54.810 --> 01:11:58.760
the compressibility
condition at some point.

01:11:58.760 --> 01:12:01.870
So we know that, oh,
we made a mistake.

01:12:01.870 --> 01:12:04.914
The assumption that it is
uniformly occupying this box

01:12:04.914 --> 01:12:05.414
is wrong.

01:12:12.530 --> 01:12:15.730
All right, any other questions?

01:12:15.730 --> 01:12:16.811
Yes?

01:12:16.811 --> 01:12:18.644
AUDIENCE: One of the
things that confuses me

01:12:18.644 --> 01:12:21.328
about thermodynamics
in general is

01:12:21.328 --> 01:12:23.768
the limits of its applicability.

01:12:23.768 --> 01:12:25.720
We think of it as
being very general,

01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:27.184
applying to many
different systems.

01:12:30.577 --> 01:12:33.116
For example, if we
had two bar magnets

01:12:33.116 --> 01:12:35.170
and we had the north pole
close to the south pole

01:12:35.170 --> 01:12:37.559
of the other one, and I
thought of the magnetic field

01:12:37.559 --> 01:12:39.890
in between, is it
conceivable to think

01:12:39.890 --> 01:12:41.850
of that as a
thermodynamic system?

01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:47.300
PROFESSOR: You can
think of the magnet

01:12:47.300 --> 01:12:51.440
as a thermodynamic system.

01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:55.070
And you can certainly
look at two of them,

01:12:55.070 --> 01:12:59.320
including the electromagnetic
field that surrounds them.

01:12:59.320 --> 01:13:01.640
And there would be
some conditions,

01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:04.800
like if you were to jiggle
these things with respect

01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:08.370
to each other-- and you would
maintain the entire thing

01:13:08.370 --> 01:13:12.630
in a box that prevented escape
of electromagnetic waves

01:13:12.630 --> 01:13:15.540
or heat to the outside--
that eventually

01:13:15.540 --> 01:13:19.430
this jiggling of the two magnets
will lead to their coming

01:13:19.430 --> 01:13:23.610
to equilibrium but at
a higher temperature.

01:13:23.610 --> 01:13:25.090
So this is what I'm saying.

01:13:25.090 --> 01:13:30.260
So imagine that you have-- let's
for simplicity think of, again,

01:13:30.260 --> 01:13:32.820
one big magnet that
you don't move,

01:13:32.820 --> 01:13:40.220
and one small magnet here that
you externally jiggle around.

01:13:40.220 --> 01:13:44.000
And then you remove
the source of work.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:45.730
You wait for a while.

01:13:45.730 --> 01:13:47.410
And then you find
that after a while,

01:13:47.410 --> 01:13:50.470
this thing comes
to an equilibrium.

01:13:50.470 --> 01:13:55.490
You ask, where did that
kinetic energy go to?

01:13:55.490 --> 01:13:58.560
You had some kinetic energy
that you had set into this,

01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:00.790
and the kinetic
energy disappeared.

01:14:00.790 --> 01:14:03.470
And I assume that
there are conditions

01:14:03.470 --> 01:14:09.240
that the kinetic energy could
not have escaped from this box.

01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:11.120
So the only thing that
could have happened

01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:14.305
is that that kinetic
energy heated up

01:14:14.305 --> 01:14:18.440
the air of the box, the
magnet, or whatever you have.

01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:23.370
So thermodynamics is applicable
in that sense to your system.

01:14:23.370 --> 01:14:27.220
Now, if you ask me, is
it applicable to having

01:14:27.220 --> 01:14:33.580
a single electron spin
that is polarized because

01:14:33.580 --> 01:14:35.935
of the magnetic field
and some condition

01:14:35.935 --> 01:14:40.950
that I set it to oscillate,
then it's not applicable,

01:14:40.950 --> 01:14:44.470
because then I know some
quantum mechanical rules that

01:14:44.470 --> 01:14:45.750
govern this.

01:14:45.750 --> 01:14:47.570
There may be in
some circumstances

01:14:47.570 --> 01:14:51.780
some conservation law that says
this with oscillate forever.

01:14:51.780 --> 01:14:53.720
If it doesn't oscillate
forever, there's

01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:55.690
presumably a
transition matrix that

01:14:55.690 --> 01:14:59.620
says it will admit a particular
photon of a particular energy.

01:14:59.620 --> 01:15:02.830
And I have to ask what
happened to that photon.

01:15:02.830 --> 01:15:07.210
So what we will see later
on is that thermodynamics

01:15:07.210 --> 01:15:12.730
is very powerful, but it's
not a fundamental theory

01:15:12.730 --> 01:15:14.750
in this sense that
the quantum mechanics

01:15:14.750 --> 01:15:16.990
that governs the spins.

01:15:16.990 --> 01:15:20.300
And the reason that this works
for the case of the magnet

01:15:20.300 --> 01:15:24.060
is because the magnet has
billions of spins in it--

01:15:24.060 --> 01:15:27.100
billions and billions
of spins, or whatever.

01:15:27.100 --> 01:15:32.870
So it is the of large
numbers that ultimately

01:15:32.870 --> 01:15:38.550
allows you to translate
the rules of motion

01:15:38.550 --> 01:15:41.590
into a well-defined
theory that is

01:15:41.590 --> 01:15:42.980
consistent with thermodynamics.

01:15:45.556 --> 01:15:47.681
AUDIENCE: I know that my
question seemed off-topic.

01:15:47.681 --> 01:15:50.141
But the reason why I asked
about this particular system

01:15:50.141 --> 01:15:53.040
is because I would
think that it doesn't

01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:55.330
have a positive compressibility.

01:15:55.330 --> 01:16:00.960
Like if you pull the two
magnets apart very slowly,

01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:04.320
the force pulling them
together decreases

01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:06.610
instead of increasing
like with the rubber band.

01:16:11.998 --> 01:16:12.660
PROFESSOR: OK.

01:16:12.660 --> 01:16:18.460
It may be that you have to
add additional agents in order

01:16:18.460 --> 01:16:20.150
to make the whole system work.

01:16:20.150 --> 01:16:24.390
So it may be that the
picture that I had in mind

01:16:24.390 --> 01:16:26.330
was that you have
the magnet that

01:16:26.330 --> 01:16:28.230
is being pushed up and down.

01:16:28.230 --> 01:16:31.570
And I really do put
a number of springs

01:16:31.570 --> 01:16:35.570
that make sure there exists
an equilibrium position.

01:16:35.570 --> 01:16:38.800
If there is no mechanical
equilibrium position,

01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:43.900
then the story is not whether
or not to thermodynamic applies.

01:16:43.900 --> 01:16:47.590
It's a question of whether or
not there is an equilibrium.

01:16:47.590 --> 01:16:52.400
So in order for me to
talk about thermodynamics

01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:56.590
I need to know that there
is an eventual equilibrium.

01:16:56.590 --> 01:17:00.520
and that's why I actually recast
the answer to your question,

01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:03.560
eventually getting rid of
the kinetic energy of this

01:17:03.560 --> 01:17:06.190
so that I have a system
that is in equilibrium.

01:17:06.190 --> 01:17:09.790
If there are things that
are not in equilibrium,

01:17:09.790 --> 01:17:10.930
all bets are off.

01:17:10.930 --> 01:17:14.420
Thermodynamics is the science of
things that are in equilibrium.

01:17:22.689 --> 01:17:23.355
Other questions?

01:17:26.140 --> 01:17:31.960
All right, so there is only one
minor part of our description--

01:17:31.960 --> 01:17:35.240
rapid survey of
thermodynamics-- that is left.

01:17:35.240 --> 01:17:38.190
And that's the third
law of thermodynamics

01:17:38.190 --> 01:17:45.270
and that has to do something
with the behavior of things

01:17:45.270 --> 01:17:48.220
as you go towards
the limit of the zero

01:17:48.220 --> 01:17:50.670
of thermodynamic temperature.

01:17:50.670 --> 01:17:57.890
And I think we will spend maybe
10, 15 minutes next lecture

01:17:57.890 --> 01:18:01.210
talking about the third
law of thermodynamics.

01:18:01.210 --> 01:18:03.750
Probably from my
perspective, that

01:18:03.750 --> 01:18:07.000
is enough time with
respect towards the time

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.720
we spend on the other
laws of thermodynamics,

01:18:09.720 --> 01:18:12.690
because as I will
emphasize to you also,

01:18:12.690 --> 01:18:15.760
the third law of
thermodynamics is in some sense

01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:17.870
less valid than the others.

01:18:17.870 --> 01:18:20.230
It's certainly correct
and it is valid.

01:18:20.230 --> 01:18:24.730
It is just that its validity
rests on other things than what

01:18:24.730 --> 01:18:26.660
I was emphasizing
right now, which

01:18:26.660 --> 01:18:29.850
is the large number
of degrees of freedom.

01:18:29.850 --> 01:18:31.940
You could have a large
number of degrees

01:18:31.940 --> 01:18:34.200
of freedom in a world
that is governed

01:18:34.200 --> 01:18:38.090
by classic laws of physics, and
the third law of thermodynamics

01:18:38.090 --> 01:18:39.520
would be violated.

01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:41.730
So it is a condition
that we live

01:18:41.730 --> 01:18:45.610
in a world that is governed by
quantum mechanics that tells us

01:18:45.610 --> 01:18:49.670
about the third law, as
we will discuss next time.
