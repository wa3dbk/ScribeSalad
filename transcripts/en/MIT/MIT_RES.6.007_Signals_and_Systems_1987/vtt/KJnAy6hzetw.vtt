[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:42.327 --> 00:00:45.850
PROFESSOR: I'm Al Oppenheim, and
I'd like to welcome you to

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.260
this videotape course on
signals and systems.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.810
Signals, at least as an informal
definition, are

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.820
functions of one or more
independent variables that

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.460
typically carry some type
of information.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.950
Systems, in our setting,
would typically be

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.860
used to process signals.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.740
One very common example of a
signal might be, let's say, a

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.130
speech signal.

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.670
And you might think of the air
pressure as a function of

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.920
time, or perhaps the electrical
signal after it

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.580
goes through the microphone
transducer as a function of

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.150
time, as representing
the speech signal.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.120
And we might see a typical
speech signal looking

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.990
something like I've
indicated here.

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.310
It's a function of time, in
this particular case.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.970
And the independent variable,
being time, is, in fact,

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.290
continuous.

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.780
And so a signal like this, we
will typically be referring to

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.570
as a continuous time signal.

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.180
Now, it also, for this
particular example, is a

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.470
function of one independent
variable.

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:06.660
And that will be referred to
as a one-dimensional signal

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.470
corresponding to the fact that
there's only one independent

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.890
variable instead of several
independent variables.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.696
So the speech signal is an
example of a continuous time,

00:02:18.696 --> 00:02:19.946
one-dimensional signal.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.990
Now, signals can, of course,
be multi-dimensional.

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.740
And they may not have, as their
independent variables,

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.130
time variables.

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.000
One very common example
are the examples

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.080
represented by images.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.340
Images, as signals, we might
think of as representing

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.020
brightness, as it varies
in a horizontal

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.500
and vertical direction.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.720
And so the brightness as a
function of these two spatial

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.990
variables is then a
two-dimensional signal.

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:07.460
And the independent variables
would typically be continuous,

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:09.730
but of course they're
not time variables.

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.690
And incidentally, it's worth
just commenting that very

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.950
often, simply for convenience,
we'll have a tendency to refer

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.230
to the independent variables
when we talk about signals as

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.170
time variables, whether or not
they really do represent time.

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.690
Well, let me illustrate one
example of an image.

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:37.790
And this is a picture of J. B.
J. Fourier, who, perhaps, more

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.240
than anyone else, is responsible
for the elegance

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.260
and beauty of a lot of the
concepts that we'll be talking

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.780
about throughout this course.

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.470
And when you look at this, in
addition to seeing Fourier

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.720
himself, you should recognize
that what you're looking at is

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.530
basically a signal which is
brightness as a function of

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.400
the horizontal and vertical
spatial variables.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:08.960
As another example of an image
as a signal, let's look at an

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.610
aerial photograph.

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:16.040
This is an aerial photograph
taken over a set of roads,

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.019
which you can more or less
recognize in the picture.

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:23.600
And one of the difficulties with
this signal is that the

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.430
road system is somewhat obscured
by cloud cover.

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.990
And what I'll want to show later
as an example of what a

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.340
system might do to such a
signal, in terms of processing

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:41.540
it, is an attempt to at least
compensate somewhat for the

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:44.900
cloud cover that's represented
in the photograph.

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.140
Although in terms of the
detailed analysis that we go

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:52.550
through during the course, our
focus of attention is pretty

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.810
much restricted to
one-dimensional signals.

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.940
In fact, we will be using
two-dimensional signals, more

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.390
specifically images, very often
to illustrate a variety

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:06.090
of concepts.

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.400
Now, speech and images are
examples of what we've

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.250
referred to as continuous-time
signals in that they are

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:18.990
functions of continuous
variables.

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.380
An equally important class of
signals that we will be

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:27.170
concentrating on in the course
are signals that are

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:33.750
discrete-time signals, where by
discrete-time, what we mean

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:38.770
is that the signal is a
function of an integer

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:44.570
variable, and so specifically
only takes on values at

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:48.150
integer values of
the argument.

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:52.820
So here is a graphical
illustration of a

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:54.540
discrete-time signal.

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:58.290
And discrete-time signals arise
in a variety of ways.

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:04.040
One very common example that
is seen fairly often is

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:08.440
discrete-time signals in the
context of economic time

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:13.250
series, for example, stock
market analysis.

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:17.810
So what I show here is one
very commonly occurring

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:21.220
example of a discrete-time
signal.

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:25.330
It represents the weekly
stock market index.

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:30.390
The independent variable in this
case is the week number.

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:34.780
And we see what the stock market
is doing over this

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:37.830
particular period as
a function of the

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:38.830
number of the week.

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:41.550
And, of course, along
the vertical axis

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:44.800
is the weekly index.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.660
Incidentally, this particular
period was

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:49.925
not chosen at random.

00:06:49.925 --> 00:06:54.260
It In fact captures a very
interesting aspect of stock

00:06:54.260 --> 00:07:00.640
market history, namely the stock
market crash in 1929,

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:05.180
which, in fact, is represented
by the behavior of this

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:08.720
discrete-time signal,
or sequence, in

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:09.810
this particular area.

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:12.960
So this dramatic dip, in
fact, is the stock

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:16.610
market crash of 1929.

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:21.340
Well, the Dow Jones weekly
average is an example of a

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:24.520
one-dimensional discrete-time
signal.

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:29.150
And just as with continuous
time, we had not just

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:31.810
one-dimensional but
multi-dimensional signals,

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:35.950
likewise we have
multi-dimensional signals in

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:41.870
the discrete-time case where,
in that case, then, the

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:43.900
discrete-time signal that
we're talking about, or

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:48.160
sequence, is a function of
two integer variables.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:52.230
And as one example, this might,
let's say, represent a

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:58.330
spatial antenna array where this
is array number in, let's

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:01.730
say, the horizontal direction,
and this is array number in

00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:03.550
the vertical direction.

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:06.070
Both classes of signals,
continuous-time and

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:10.100
discrete-time, as I've
indicated, are very important.

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:14.300
And it should be emphasized
that the importance of

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:17.680
discrete-time signals and
associated processing

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:22.490
continues to grow in large part
because of the current

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:27.400
and emerging technologies that
permit, basically, the

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:32.900
processing of continuous-time
signals by first converting

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:36.309
them to discrete-time signals
and processing them with

00:08:36.309 --> 00:08:37.990
discrete-time systems.

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:42.429
And that, in fact, is a topic
that we will discuss in a fair

00:08:42.429 --> 00:08:44.710
amount of detail later
on in the course.

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:51.620
Let's now our attention
to systems.

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:58.190
And as I indicated, a system
basically processes signals.

00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:02.830
And they have, of course,
inputs and outputs.

00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:06.670
And depending on whether we're
talking about continuous time

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:11.340
or discrete time, the system
may be a continuous-time

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:14.130
system or a discrete-time
system.

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:18.030
So in the continuous-time case,
I indicate here an input

00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:23.050
x(t) and an output y(t) If
we were talking about a

00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:27.790
discrete-time system, I would
represent the input in terms

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:32.170
of a discrete-time variable,
and, of course, the output in

00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:36.050
terms of a discrete-time
variable also.

00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:40.700
Now, in very general terms,
systems are hard to deal with

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:45.530
because they are defined very
broadly and very generally.

00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:49.770
And in dealing with systems and
analyzing them, what we

00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:55.060
will do is attempt to exploit
some very specific, and as

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:59.410
we'll see, very useful
system properties.

00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:04.160
To indicate what I mean and how
things might be split up,

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:07.660
we could talk about systems, and
will talk about systems,

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:10.300
that are linear.

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:14.090
And we could divide systems,
basically, into systems that

00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:20.510
are either linear or nonlinear,
and we will, and

00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:24.590
also divide systems into systems
that are what we'll

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:29.420
refer to as time-invariant
or time-varying systems.

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:33.320
And these aren't terms that
we've defined yet, of course,

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:37.160
but we will be defining in
the course very shortly.

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:40.640
And while, in some sense, this
division represents all

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:45.260
systems, and this does, too,
the focus of the course is

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:49.040
really going to be principally
on linear,

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:50.860
time-invariant systems.

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:55.560
So it's basically these systems
that we will be

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:57.120
focusing on.

00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:00.692
And we'll be referring to
those systems as linear,

00:11:00.692 --> 00:11:04.880
time-invariant systems.

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:08.100
Well, as a brief glimpse at some
of the kinds of things

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:14.140
that systems can do, let me
illustrate, first in a

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:17.570
one-dimensional continuous-time
context, and

00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:21.840
then later with a discrete-time
example, one

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:27.020
example of some processing
of signals with

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:28.540
an appropriate system.

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:32.630
The particular example that I
want to illustrate relates to

00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:35.740
the restoration of
old recordings.

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:38.960
And this is some work that was
done by Professor Thomas

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:43.190
Stockham, who is at the
University of Utah, and work

00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:46.800
that he had done a number of
years ago relating to the fact

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:53.380
that in old recordings, for
example in Caruso recordings,

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:57.380
the recording was done through
a mechanical horn, and the

00:11:57.380 --> 00:11:59.990
characteristics of the
horn tended to

00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:01.860
vary from day to day.

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:04.900
And because of the
characteristics of the horn,

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:08.190
the recording tended to have a
muffled quality, something

00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:12.360
like this, sort of the sense
that you would get if you were

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:15.120
speaking through a megaphone.

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:20.360
What Professor Stockham did
was develop a system to

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:25.260
process these old recordings
in such a way that a lot of

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:28.650
the characteristics and
distortion due to that

00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:30.710
recording system was removed.

00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:34.870
So I'd like to illustrate that
as one example of some signal

00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:38.790
processing with an appropriate
continuous-time system.

00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:43.400
And what you'll hear is
a two-track recording.

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:47.830
On the first track is the
original, unrestored Caruso

00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:52.130
recording, and on the second
track is the result of the

00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:53.280
restoration.

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:56.910
And so as I switch back and
forth from channel one to

00:12:56.910 --> 00:13:00.890
channel two, we'll be switching
from the original to

00:13:00.890 --> 00:13:02.280
the restored.

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:06.330
We'll begin the tape by
playing the original.

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:10.170
And then, as it proceeds,
we'll switch.

00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:12.350
So we'll begin on channel one.

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:19.300
[MUSIC PLAYING, MUFFLED]

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:21.640
That's the original recording.

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:22.600
And switch now to
the processed.

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:31.970
[MUSIC PLAYING, CLEARER]

00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:37.850
Now let's switch back,
back to the original.

00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:48.020
Back to the restoration.

00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:58.030
And once again, back
to the original.

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:09.500
And presumably and hopefully,
what you heard was that in the

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:13.830
restoration, in fact, a lot of
the muffled characteristics of

00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:19.470
the original recording were
compensated for or removed.

00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:22.480
Now one of the interesting
things that happened, in fact,

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:26.620
in the work that Professor
Stockham did is that in the

00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:28.060
process of the restoration--

00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:30.160
and perhaps you heard this--

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:33.020
in the process of the
restoration, in fact, some of

00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:37.580
the background noise on the
recording was emphasized.

00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:43.310
And so he processed the signal
further in an attempt to

00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:45.350
remove that background noise.

00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:48.250
And with that particular
processing, the processing was

00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:51.060
very highly nonlinear.

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:54.980
A very interesting thing
happened, which was that not

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:59.060
only in that processing was the
background noise removed,

00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:02.180
but somewhat surprisingly,
also the

00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:03.630
orchestra was removed.

00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:08.240
And let me just play that now
as an example of some very

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:11.930
sophisticated processing with
a nonlinear system.

00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:17.515
What you'll hear on channel one
is the restoration as we

00:15:17.515 --> 00:15:19.320
had just played it.

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:23.610
When I switch to channel two,
it will be after the

00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:27.986
processing with an attempt to
remove the orchestra and the

00:15:27.986 --> 00:15:30.060
background noise.

00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:31.310
Channel one now.

00:15:38.696 --> 00:15:41.691
And now the noise and
orchestra removed.

00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:46.293
Back to channel one.

00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:02.085
And finally, once again, with
the orchestra removed.

00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:15.950
So that's an example
of processing of a

00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:19.280
continuous-time signal
with a corresponding

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:21.160
continuous-time system.

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:25.800
Now I'd like to illustrate an
example of some processing on

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:27.600
a discrete-time signal.

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:30.730
And I'd like to do that in the
context of the example that I

00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:33.260
showed before of a discrete-time
signal, which

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:38.660
was the Dow Jones Industrial
weekly stock market index.

00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:44.880
I had shown it before, as I've
shown it here again, over a

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:49.550
period of slightly more than a
year, where this is the number

00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:53.630
of weeks and this is
the weekly index.

00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:58.640
And to illustrate some of the
processing, what I'd like to

00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:03.020
do is show the stock market
index, the weekly index, over

00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:07.750
a much longer time period, in
particular, the weekly index

00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:10.119
over a 10 year period.

00:17:10.119 --> 00:17:12.290
And that's what I show here.

00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:19.329
So what this covers is
roughly 1927 to 1937.

00:17:19.329 --> 00:17:22.950
And in this case, although this
is still a discrete-time

00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:26.319
signal, just simply for the
purposes of display, what

00:17:26.319 --> 00:17:31.010
we've done is to essentially
connect the dots and draw a

00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:34.550
continuous curve through the
points so that this picture

00:17:34.550 --> 00:17:37.110
isn't filled up with a lot
of vertical lines.

00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:42.050
So this is the discrete-time
sequence that represents the

00:17:42.050 --> 00:17:46.970
weekly Dow Jones Index over
a 10 year period.

00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:53.250
And here, by the way, again,
is the crash of 1929.

00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:56.990
It's interesting to note, by
the way, that actually the

00:17:56.990 --> 00:18:02.050
disaster in the stock market
wasn't so much the 1929 crash

00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:04.780
but the long downward trend
that followed that.

00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:10.430
And you can see that here by
filtering through, by eye, the

00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:13.220
rapid variations in the index.

00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:17.160
And what you see is this
smooth downward trend

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:23.000
followed, eventually,
by an upward trend.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.800
Now, this issue of looking at
something like this, looking

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:33.180
at a sequence, and following
the smoother parts of it,

00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:37.950
namely the long term trends, is,
in fact, something that is

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:40.470
done quite typically
with economic

00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:42.325
time series like this.

00:18:42.325 --> 00:18:47.560
And in particular, what's done
is to smooth it, or average

00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:53.820
over some time period, to
emphasize the slow variations

00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:56.750
and de-emphasize the
rapid variations.

00:18:56.750 --> 00:19:01.070
And that, in fact, is processing
that is done with a

00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:02.560
discrete-time system.

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:06.660
So when you hear referred to,
let's say, in stock market

00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:11.070
reports, a 51-day moving
average, that, in fact, is

00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:15.630
processing the stock market
index with a particular

00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:17.460
discrete-time system.

00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:21.960
The result of doing that on
this particular example

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:25.090
generates a smooth version
of the curve,

00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:27.040
which I overlay here.

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:34.330
And the overlay, then, is really
attempting to track the

00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:37.600
smoother variations and
de-emphasize the more rapid

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:39.370
variations.

00:19:39.370 --> 00:19:42.930
Let me just slightly offset that
so that the difference

00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:44.680
stands out a little more.

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:51.230
And so here you see what is
the original weekly index.

00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:56.280
And this is the result of
processing that sequence with

00:19:56.280 --> 00:20:00.990
an appropriate system
to apply smoothing.

00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:04.110
And in fact, what it is
is a moving average.

00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:08.330
And so here again, you can see,
in the smoother curve,

00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:12.800
this general downward trend
up until this time period,

00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:17.620
followed by, eventually,
a recovery.

00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:23.560
Well, we've seen an example with
a continuous-time signal,

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:26.070
the Caruso recording, an example
of the discrete-time

00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:28.900
signal, this stock
market index.

00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:33.810
And what I'd also like to show
is a third example, which is

00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:38.320
the result of some processing on
an image, in particular the

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:40.720
image that we talked about
before, which was the aerial

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:45.000
photograph that had the problem
of some cloud cover.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:50.570
So once again, what we see here
is the original aerial

00:20:50.570 --> 00:20:53.770
photograph with the
cloud cover.

00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:58.260
And some processing was applied
to this using a system

00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:02.520
which, in fact, was both
nonlinear and quote

00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:06.280
"time-varying," or, in the
case of these independent

00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:10.520
variables, we would refer to
it as spatially-varying.

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:16.100
And the result of applying that
processing is shown in

00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:18.590
the adjoining picture.

00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:24.350
And what we see there is
hopefully a reasonable attempt

00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:26.890
to compensate for
the cloud cover.

00:21:26.890 --> 00:21:31.080
And this, by the way, was some
work that was done by

00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:37.150
Professor Lim at MIT, and has
been very successful type of

00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:40.160
processing for aerial
photographs.

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:44.480
I should say, also, that this
particular example is one

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:49.670
where, although the original
signal was a signal that is

00:21:49.670 --> 00:21:52.790
continuous-time, that is, the
independent variables are

00:21:52.790 --> 00:21:57.080
continuous, as they are in a
spatial, aerial photograph, in

00:21:57.080 --> 00:22:01.180
fact, for the processing, that
picture was first converted to

00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:05.050
a sequence through a process
called sampling, which we'll

00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:06.620
be talking about later.

00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:09.180
And then the processing,
in fact, was done

00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:10.430
on a digital computer.

00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:19.340
Well, these then are some
examples of the use of some

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:25.490
systems to process some signals,
both in continuous

00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:30.290
time and discrete time, for
one-dimensional signals and

00:22:30.290 --> 00:22:34.190
for multi-dimensional signals.

00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:38.580
And as I've referred to systems,
we've thought of them

00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:42.310
as one big block with an
appropriate, or associated,

00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:43.990
input and output.

00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:47.530
And as we'll be getting into
in the first part of the

00:22:47.530 --> 00:22:52.320
course, very often, systems are
interconnected together

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:54.100
for a variety of reasons.

00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:56.010
Some of the kinds of
interconnections that we'll

00:22:56.010 --> 00:23:02.300
talk about are connecting
systems in what are called

00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:06.080
series, or cascade
interconnections, parallel

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:09.930
interconnections, feedback
interconnections.

00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:14.590
And feedback interconnections,
in fact, are very interesting,

00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:18.160
very important, and very useful,
and will be a major

00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:21.340
topic toward the end
of the course.

00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:27.280
Feedback, as you may or may not
know, comes into play in a

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:31.250
variety of situations, for
example, in amplifier design,

00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:36.770
as we'll talk about, feedback
plays an important role.

00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:42.310
In a situation where you have
a basically unstable system,

00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:45.320
feedback is often used to
stabilize the system.

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:49.520
And feedback interconnections
of systems in that sense are

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:53.020
very often used in high
performance aircraft, which

00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:56.830
are inherently unstable, and
are stabilized through this

00:23:56.830 --> 00:23:59.770
kind of interconnection.

00:23:59.770 --> 00:24:03.760
Just to give you a little sense
of this without going

00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:08.970
into any of the details, what
I'd like to show you is an

00:24:08.970 --> 00:24:15.490
excerpt from a lecture that
we'll be seeing toward the end

00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:20.340
of the course relating to the
analysis of feedback systems

00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:22.100
and the uses of feedback.

00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:25.880
And this is in the context of
what's referred to as the

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:29.670
inverted pendulum, which is
a system that's basically

00:24:29.670 --> 00:24:32.790
unstable, and feedback
interconnections are used to

00:24:32.790 --> 00:24:34.340
stabilize it.

00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:39.720
The idea, as you'll see in this
brief clip, is that there

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:44.220
is a cart that's moving on
a track with a rod that's

00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:45.880
pivoted at the base.

00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:49.500
And so that system, in the
absence of anything, is

00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:52.390
unstable in that the rod
would tend to fall.

00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:57.510
And as we go into in detail in
the lecture later, we use

00:24:57.510 --> 00:25:01.000
feedback to position
the cart under the

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.680
pendulum to balance it.

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:07.730
And in fact, that balancing
can be done even when we

00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:10.690
modify the system in a
variety of ways, as

00:25:10.690 --> 00:25:11.970
you'll see in this clip.

00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:15.850
So let's take a look at that,
remembering that this is just

00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:19.340
a brief excerpt from a
longer discussion.

00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:19.700
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:25.460
I can change the overall system
even further by, let's

00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:28.810
say, for example, pouring
a liquid in.

00:25:28.810 --> 00:25:32.870
And now, let me also comment
that I've changed the physics

00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:36.800
of it a little bit because the
liquid can slosh around a

00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:37.160
little bit.

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:40.170
It becomes a little more
complicated a system, but as

00:25:40.170 --> 00:25:43.080
you can see, it still
remains balanced.

00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:45.560
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:48.090
As you'll see when we get
to it, by the way, that

00:25:48.090 --> 00:25:51.290
demonstration was a
lot of fun to do.

00:25:51.290 --> 00:25:56.090
Now, in talking about signals
and systems as we go through

00:25:56.090 --> 00:26:01.360
the course, there are several
domains, two in particular,

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:05.850
that we will find convenient
for the analysis and

00:26:05.850 --> 00:26:10.070
representation of signals
and systems.

00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:17.100
One is the time domain, which
is what we tend to think of,

00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:21.910
and which we have kind of been
focusing on in the discussion

00:26:21.910 --> 00:26:23.950
so far in this lecture.

00:26:23.950 --> 00:26:28.890
But equally important is what's
referred to as the

00:26:28.890 --> 00:26:34.220
frequency domain as a
representation for signals,

00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:37.630
and as a means for analysis
for systems.

00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:40.600
And in the context of
the frequency domain

00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:44.750
representation, some of the
kinds of ideas and topics that

00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:50.270
we'll be exploring are the
Fourier Transform, and the

00:26:50.270 --> 00:26:55.930
Laplace Transform, and a
discrete-time counterpart of

00:26:55.930 --> 00:26:59.140
the Laplace Transform, which
is the z-Transform.

00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:02.080
The Fourier Transform discussion
we'll get into

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:03.990
fairly early in the course.

00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:08.110
And the Laplace Transform and
z-Transform represent

00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:11.200
extensions of the Fourier
transform, and we'll be

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:14.520
getting into that later
in the course.

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:18.550
Just initially to think about
the time domain and frequency

00:27:18.550 --> 00:27:21.610
domain, you might think,
for example, of

00:27:21.610 --> 00:27:23.490
a note being played.

00:27:23.490 --> 00:27:28.800
And the time-domain
representation would be how

00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:32.250
the sound pressure,
as a function

00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:34.330
of time, would change.

00:27:34.330 --> 00:27:37.560
And the frequency-domain
representation would

00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:40.960
correspond to a representation
of the frequency

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:43.440
content of the note.

00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:46.720
And, in fact, what I'd like to
do is illustrate that and

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:51.720
those two domains simultaneously
by playing a

00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:53.370
glockenspiel note.

00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:58.220
What you'll hear is the note
repeated several times over.

00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:02.490
And at the same time, you'll see
two displays, one on the

00:28:02.490 --> 00:28:05.950
left representing the time
domain display a

00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:08.820
representation of the signal,
and the one on the right

00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:11.650
representing the frequency
domain.

00:28:11.650 --> 00:28:13.350
So let's look at that.

00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:16.130
And you'll hear the note
and simultaneously

00:28:16.130 --> 00:28:17.380
see these two displays.

00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:25.850
So there's the note on the
left, the time waveform.

00:28:25.850 --> 00:28:30.285
And on the right, what we see
is the frequency content, in

00:28:30.285 --> 00:28:34.900
particular, indicating the fact
that there are several

00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:36.420
harmonic lines in the tone.

00:28:54.540 --> 00:29:00.410
Well, what I've gone through in
this lecture represents a

00:29:00.410 --> 00:29:04.450
brief overview of signals
and systems.

00:29:04.450 --> 00:29:08.340
And beginning with the next
lecture, we will be much more

00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:13.950
specific and precise, first
discussing some basic signals,

00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:16.880
and then talking about
systems, and system

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:20.860
properties, and how
to exploit them.

00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:26.890
As one final comment that I'd
like to make in this lecture,

00:29:26.890 --> 00:29:34.640
I'd like to emphasize at the
outset that the taped lectures

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:38.180
represent only one component
of the course.

00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:42.690
And equally important will be
both the textbook and the

00:29:42.690 --> 00:29:44.670
video course manual.

00:29:44.670 --> 00:29:49.140
In particular, it's important
not only to be viewing the

00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:55.470
tapes, but simultaneously, or
in conjunction with that,

00:29:55.470 --> 00:29:59.510
doing the appropriate reading
in the textbook and also

00:29:59.510 --> 00:30:02.500
working through the problems
carefully in the

00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:04.940
video course manual.

00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:08.830
In a course like this, you
basically only get out of it

00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:10.630
as much as you put into it.

00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:14.900
The hope is that if you put the
right amount of time and

00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:18.910
effort into it, you'll find the
course to be educational

00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:19.720
and interesting.

00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:22.250
And I certainly hope that
that will be the case.

00:30:22.250 --> 00:30:23.500
Thank you.
