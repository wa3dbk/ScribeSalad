[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:55.444 --> 00:00:58.610
PROFESSOR: Last time, we began
the discussion of the

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.240
z-transform.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.110
As with the Laplace transform
in continuous time, we

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.190
developed it as a
generalization

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.000
of the Fourier transform.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.230
The expression that we got for
the z-transform is the sum

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.050
that I indicate here.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.750
We also briefly talked about
an inverse z-transform

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.320
integral and some other informal
methods of computing

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.660
the inverse z-transform.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.220
But we focused in particular
on the relationship between

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.090
the z-transform and the Fourier
transform, pointing

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.800
out first of all that the
z-transform, when we choose

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.590
the magnitude of
z equal to 1--

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.440
so the magnitude of z of the
form e to the j omega--

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.150
just simply reduces
to the Fourier

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.210
transform of the sequence.

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.160
Then, in addition, we explored
the z-transform for z, a more

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.640
general complex number.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.390
In the discrete time z-transform
case, we expressed

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:12.130
that complex number in polar
form as r e to the j omega,

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:17.800
and recognize that the
z-transform expression in fact

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.900
corresponds to the Fourier
transform of the sequence

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.400
exponentially weighted.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.610
Because of the exponential
weighting, the z-transform

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.100
converges for some values of
r corresponding to some

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.320
exponential waiting, and perhaps
not for others, and

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:44.890
that led to a notion which
corresponded to the region of

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.180
convergence associated
with the z-transform.

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.680
We talked some about properties
of the region of

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.230
convergence, particularly
in relation to

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.900
the pole-zero pattern.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.090
Now, they z-transform has a
number of important and useful

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.780
properties, just as the Laplace
transform does.

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.580
As one part of this lecture,
what we'll want to do is

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.440
exploit some of these properties
in the context of

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.930
systems described by linear
constant coefficient

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.360
difference equations.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.660
These particular properties that
play an important role in

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.280
that context are the properties

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.570
that I indicate here.

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.500
In particular, there is--

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.780
as with continuous time--

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.500
a linearity property that tells
us that the z-transform

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.870
of a linear combination of
sequences is the same linear

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.140
combination of the z-transforms,
a shifting

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:50.580
property that indicates that
the z-transform of x of n

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:56.740
shifted is the z transform of x
of n multiplied by a factor

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:59.780
z to the minus n 0.

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:06.120
Then the convolution property
for which the z-transform of a

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.500
convolution of sequences is the
product of the associated

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.250
z-transforms.

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.769
With all of these properties, of
course, there is again the

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:21.760
issue of what the associated
region of convergence is in

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.840
comparison with the region
of convergence of

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.500
the original sequences.

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.040
That is an issue that's
addressed somewhat more in the

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.730
text and let's not
go into it here.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:40.890
With the convolution property,
the convolution property as in

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:45.220
continuous time, of course,
provides a mechanism for

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.750
dealing with linear time
invariant systems.

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.640
In particular, in the time
domain a linear time invariant

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.980
system is described through
convolution--

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:00.610
namely, the output is the
convolution of the input and

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.770
the impulse response.

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.810
Because of the convolution
property associated with the

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:11.590
z-transform, the z-transform
of the output is the

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:15.650
z-transform of the input
times the z-transform

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:17.580
of the impulse response.

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:22.410
Again, very much the same as
what we had in continuous time

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:26.590
and also what we had in the
context of the discussion with

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:29.410
the Fourier transform.

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:32.290
In fact, because of the
relationship between the

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:37.280
z-transform and the Fourier
transform, the z-transform of

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.690
the impulse response evaluated
on the unit circle--

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:44.570
in other words, for the
magnitude of z equal to 1--

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:47.620
in fact corresponds
to the frequency

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.060
response of the system.

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:53.400
More generally, when we talk
about the z-transform of the

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:58.300
impulse response, we will refer
to it as the system

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.225
function associated
with the system.

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:06.030
Now, the convolution property
and these other properties, as

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:09.740
I indicated, we will find
useful in talking about

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:13.260
systems which are described by
linear constant coefficient

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:18.460
difference equations, and in
fact, we'll do that shortly.

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:25.320
But first what I'd like to do is
to continue to focus on the

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:29.270
system function for linear time
invariant systems, and

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:33.350
make a couple of comments that
tie back to some things that

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:38.280
we said in the last lecture
relating to the relationship

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:43.510
between the region of
convergence of a system, or--

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:47.080
I'm sorry, the region of
convergence of a z-transform--

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:54.040
and the issue of where that is
in relation to the poles of

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.290
the z-transform.

00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:00.260
In particular, we can draw some
conclusions tying back to

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:05.780
that discussion about the pole
locations of the system

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:11.810
function in relation to whether
the system is stable

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:15.510
and whether the system
is causal.

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:19.960
In particular, recall from one
of the early lectures way back

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:25.830
when that stability for a system
corresponded to the

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:28.500
statement that the
impulse response

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:31.450
is absolutely summable.

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:35.640
Furthermore, when we talked
about the Fourier transform,

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:42.220
the Fourier transform of a
sequence converges if the

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:44.500
sequence is absolutely
summable.

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:50.630
So in fact, the condition for
stability of a system and the

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:53.540
condition for convergence of the
Fourier transform of its

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:58.820
impulse response are the same
condition, namely absolute

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:00.900
summability.

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:02.750
Now what does this mean?

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:07.870
What it means is that if the
Fourier transform converges,

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:11.140
that means that the z-transform
converges on the

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:13.640
unit circle.

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:18.200
Consequently, if the system
is stable, then the system

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:22.500
function, the z-transform or
the impulse response, must

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:25.210
also converge on the
unit circle.

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:28.610
In other words, the impulse
response must have a Fourier

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:31.160
transform that converges.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:36.549
So for a stable system, then,
the region of convergence of

00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:39.450
the system function must
include the unit

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:42.620
circle in the z-plane.

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:50.080
So we see how stability relates
to the location of the

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:54.450
region of convergence, and we
can also relate causality to

00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:55.670
the region of convergence.

00:08:55.670 --> 00:09:01.850
In particular, we know that if
a system is causal, then the

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:05.980
impulse response
is right-sided.

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:08.250
For a sequence that's
right-sided, the region of

00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:12.060
convergence of its z-transform
must be outside

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:15.110
the outermost pole.

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:18.800
So for causality, the region of
convergence of the system

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:21.710
function must be outside
the outermost pole.

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:25.350
For stability, the region of
convergence must include the

00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:30.150
unit circle, and we can also
then draw from that the

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:34.840
conclusion that if we have a
system that's causal unstable,

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:39.430
then all poles must be inside
the unit circle because of the

00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:41.130
fact that the poles must--

00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:44.420
because of the fact that the
region of convergence must be

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:47.480
outside the outermost
pole and has to also

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:49.910
include the unit circle.

00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:55.780
So for example, if we had let's
say a system with a

00:09:55.780 --> 00:10:05.840
system function as I indicate
here with the algebraic

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:09.930
expression for the system
function being the expression

00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:13.810
that I indicate here with the
pole at z equals a third and

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:18.290
another pole at z equals 2
and a zero at the origin.

00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:24.210
If, in fact, the system was
causal, corresponding to an

00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:28.050
impulse response that's
right-sided, this then would

00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:34.050
be the region of convergence
of the system function.

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:38.220
Alternatively, if I knew that
the system was stable, then I

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:40.910
know that the region of
convergence must include the

00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:45.080
unit circle, and so this would
be then the region of

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:46.640
convergence.

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:53.690
And what you might now want to
ask yourselves is if instead

00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:57.980
the region of convergence for
the system function is this,

00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:00.570
then is the system causal?

00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:02.390
That's the first question.

00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:06.340
The second question is
is the system stable?

00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:08.840
Remembering that for causality,
the region of

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:12.150
convergence must be outside the
outermost pole, and for

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:16.540
stability it must include
the unit circle.

00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:25.200
Now what I'd like to do is look
at the properties of the

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:29.430
z-transform, and in particular
exploit these properties in

00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:33.850
the context of systems that
are described by linear

00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:36.930
constant coefficient difference
equations.

00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:40.230
The three basic properties that
play a key role in that

00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:44.980
discussion are the linearity
property, the shifting

00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:49.860
property, and the convolution
property.

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:52.430
These, then, are the properties

00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:55.380
that I want to exploit.

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:59.740
So let's do that by first
looking at a first order

00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:02.480
difference equation.

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:06.310
In the case of a first order
difference equation, which

00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:09.170
I've written as I
indicate here--

00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:11.930
no terms on the right hand side,
but we could have terms

00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:13.860
of course, in general--

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:17.900
y of n minus ay of n minus
1 equals x of n.

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:24.630
We can use the linearity
property, so that if we take

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:28.570
the z-transform of both sides of
this expression, that will

00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:32.110
then be the z-transform of this
term plus the z-transform

00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:34.180
of this term.

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:39.790
So using those properties and
together with the shifting

00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:44.010
property, the property that
tells us that the z-transform

00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:49.110
of y of n minus 1 is z to the
minus 1 times the z-transform

00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:53.520
of y of n, we then convert the
difference equation to an

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:55.400
algebraic expression.

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:58.940
And we can solve this algebraic
expression for the

00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:02.600
z-transform of the output
in terms of the

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:06.100
z-transform of the input.

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:11.820
Now what we know from the
convolution property is that

00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:15.670
for a system, the z-transform
of the output is the system

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:18.440
function times the z-transform
of the input.

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:24.720
So this factor that we have,
then, must correspond to the

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:29.260
system function, or equivalently
the z-transform

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:32.360
of the impulse response
of the system.

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:36.200
In fact, then, if we have this
z-transform, we could figure

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:41.560
out what the impulse response of
the system is by computing

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:45.730
or determining what the inverse
z-transform, except

00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:52.590
for the fact that expression is
an algebraic expression and

00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:55.940
doesn't yet totally specify
the z-transform because we

00:13:55.940 --> 00:14:00.210
don't yet know what the region
of convergence is.

00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:02.670
How do we get the region
of convergence?

00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:05.320
Well, we have the same issue
here as we had with the

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:06.980
Laplace transform--

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:13.440
namely, the point that the
difference equation tells us,

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:17.340
in essence, what the algebraic
expression is for the system

00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:22.080
function, but doesn't specify
the region of convergence.

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:26.910
That is specified by either
explicitly, because one way or

00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:30.590
another we know what the
impulse response is, or

00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:33.940
implicitly, because we know
certain properties of the

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:40.130
system, such as causality
and or stability.

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:46.030
If I, let's say, imposed on this
system, in addition to

00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:55.580
the difference equation, the
condition of causality, then

00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:59.530
what that requires is that
the impulse response be

00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:03.700
right-sided or the region of
convergence be outside the

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:05.330
outermost pole.

00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:09.350
So, for this example that would
require, then, that the

00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:12.940
region of convergence correspond
to the magnitude of

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:18.190
z greater than the
magnitude of a.

00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:21.670
What you might think about is
whether I would get the same

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:25.960
condition if I required
instead that

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:29.310
the system be stable.

00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:31.500
Furthermore, you could think
about the question of whether

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:35.480
I could specify or impose on
this system that it be both

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:37.090
stable and causal.

00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:39.760
The real issue-- and let me
just kind of point to it--

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:43.970
is that the answer to those
questions relate to whether

00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:46.730
the magnitude of a is less than
1 or the magnitude of a

00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:48.160
is greater than 1.

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.810
If the magnitude of a is less
than 1 and I specify

00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:57.320
causality, that will also mean
that the system is stable.

00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:02.170
In any case, given this region
of convergence, then the

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:06.340
impulse response is the inverse
transform of that

00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:08.780
z-transform, which is a
to the n times u of n.

00:16:11.490 --> 00:16:15.680
Now let's look at a second order
equation, and there's a

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:17.470
very similar strategy.

00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:21.430
For the second order equation,
the one that I've picked is of

00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:24.700
this particular form, and I've
written the coefficients

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:28.270
parametrically as I indicate
here for a specific reason,

00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:29.880
which we'll see shortly.

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:32.870
Again, I can apply the
z-transform to this

00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:38.580
expression, and I've skipped an
algebraic step or two here.

00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:42.970
When I do this, then, again I
use the linearity property and

00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:46.790
the shifting property, and I
end up with this algebraic

00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:47.890
expression.

00:16:47.890 --> 00:16:54.240
If I now solve that to express
y of z in terms of x of z and

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:58.790
a function of z, then
this is what I get

00:16:58.790 --> 00:17:00.040
for the system function.

00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:06.970
So this is now a second order
system function, and we'll

00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:12.960
have two zeroes at the origin
and it will have two poles.

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:17.339
Again, there's the question of
what we assume about the

00:17:17.339 --> 00:17:18.349
region of convergence--

00:17:18.349 --> 00:17:20.240
I haven't specified that yet.

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:25.990
But if we, let's say, assume
that the system is causal,

00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:29.050
which I will tend to do, then
that means that the region of

00:17:29.050 --> 00:17:32.830
convergence is outside
the outermost pole.

00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:34.080
Now, where are the poles?

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:38.920
Well, let me just kind
of indicate that if--

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:40.010
and you can verify this

00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:43.250
algebraically at your leisure--

00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:52.680
that if the cosine theta term is
less than 1, then the roots

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:56.110
of this polynomial
will be complex.

00:17:56.110 --> 00:18:00.570
And in fact, the poles
are at r e to the

00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:02.740
plus or minus j theta.

00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:08.970
So for cosine theta less than 1,
then the poles are complex,

00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:13.960
and the complex poles at an
angle theta and with a

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:18.070
distance from the origin equal
to the parameter r.

00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:21.550
In fact, let's just
look at that.

00:18:21.550 --> 00:18:27.640
What I show here is the
pole zero pattern.

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:34.490
Assuming that r is less than
1, and that cosine theta is

00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:40.300
less than 1, and we have a
complex pole pair shown here--

00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:44.210
now if we assume that the system
was causal, that means

00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:48.240
that the region of convergence
is outside these poles.

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:51.300
That would then include the unit
circle, which means that

00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:54.290
the system is also stable.

00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:57.370
In fact, as long as the reach
of convergence includes the

00:18:57.370 --> 00:19:02.850
unit circle, we can also talk
about the frequency response

00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:03.680
of the system--

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:05.240
namely, we can evaluate
the system

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:08.500
function on the unit circle.

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:13.270
We, in fact, evaluated the
Fourier transform associated

00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:16.660
with this pole zero
pattern last time.

00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:21.210
Recall that the frequency
response, then, is one that

00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:26.620
has a resonant character with
the resonant peak being

00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:33.010
roughly in the vicinity of the
angle of the pole location.

00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:36.490
As the parameter r varies--
let's say, as r gets smaller--

00:19:36.490 --> 00:19:38.710
this peak tends to broaden.

00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:41.980
As r gets closer to
1, the resonance

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:43.230
tends to get sharper.

00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:55.100
This is now a look at the
z-transform, and we see very

00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:59.000
strong parallels to the
Laplace transform.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.920
In fact, throughout the
course, I've tried to

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:03.700
emphasize--

00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:05.590
and it just naturally
happens--

00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:10.370
that there are very strong
relationships and parallels

00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:14.890
between continuous time
and discrete time.

00:20:14.890 --> 00:20:19.940
In fact, at one point we
specifically mapped from

00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:22.960
continuous time to discrete
time when we talked about

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:27.460
discrete time processing of
continuous time signals.

00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:32.760
What I'd like to do now is turn
our attention to another

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:38.000
very important reason for
mapping from continuous time

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.600
to discrete time, and in the
process of doing this, what

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:46.670
we'll need to do is exploit
fairly heavily the insight,

00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:51.210
intuition, and procedures that
we've developed for the

00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:55.150
Laplace transform and
the z-transform.

00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:59.540
Specifically, what I would like
to begin is a discussion

00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:06.530
relating to mapping continuous
time filters to discrete time

00:21:06.530 --> 00:21:12.260
filters, or continuous time
system functions to discrete

00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:14.410
time system functions.

00:21:14.410 --> 00:21:17.170
Now, why would we
want to do that?

00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:21.130
Well, there are at least several
reasons for wanting to

00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:25.140
map continuous time filters
to discrete time filters.

00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:29.940
One, of course, is the fact that
in some situations what

00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:34.140
we're interested in doing is
processing continuous time

00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:38.220
signals with discrete
time systems--

00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:45.050
or, said another way, simulate
continuous time systems with

00:21:45.050 --> 00:21:46.690
discrete time systems.

00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:49.530
So it would be natural in a
setting like that to think of

00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:53.500
mapping the desired continuous
time filter to a

00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:55.840
discrete time filter.

00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:58.480
So that's one very important
context.

00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:02.880
There's another very important
context in which this is done,

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:11.650
and that is in the context or
for the purpose of exploiting

00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:16.180
established design procedures
for continuous time filters.

00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:18.440
The point is the following.

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:22.240
We may or may not be processing
a sample continuous

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:25.260
time signal with our discrete
time filter-- it may just be

00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:28.630
discrete time signals that
we're working with.

00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:34.460
But in that situation, still,
we need to design the

00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:38.280
appropriate discrete
time filter.

00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:46.300
Historically, there is a very
rich history associated with

00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:50.290
design of continuous
time filters.

00:22:50.290 --> 00:22:54.860
In many cases, it's possible
and very worthwhile and

00:22:54.860 --> 00:23:00.790
efficient to take those designs
and map them to

00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:04.880
discrete time designs to use
them as discrete time filters.

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:08.650
So, another very important
reason for talking about the

00:23:08.650 --> 00:23:13.120
kinds of mappings that we will
be going into is to simply

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:16.800
take advantage of what has been
done historically in the

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:18.050
continuous time case.

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:26.160
Now, if we want to map
continuous time filters to

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:31.330
discrete time filters, then in
continuous time, we're talking

00:23:31.330 --> 00:23:34.820
about a system function
and an associated

00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:37.840
differential equation.

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:43.230
In discrete time, there is the
corresponding system function

00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:46.105
and the corresponding
difference equation.

00:23:49.170 --> 00:23:53.960
Basically what we want to do is
generate from a continuous

00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:59.640
time system in some way a
discrete time system that

00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:05.650
meets an associated set of
desired specifications.

00:24:05.650 --> 00:24:09.530
Now, there are certain
constraints that it's

00:24:09.530 --> 00:24:13.410
reasonable and important to
impose on whatever kinds of

00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:15.940
mappings we use.

00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:19.230
Obviously, we want a mapping
that will take our continuous

00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:21.900
time system function
and map it to a

00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:24.780
discrete time system function.

00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:28.210
Correspondingly in the time
domain, there is a continuous

00:24:28.210 --> 00:24:32.520
time impulse response that
maps to the associated

00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:35.610
discrete time impulse
response.

00:24:35.610 --> 00:24:37.710
These are more or
less natural.

00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:41.310
The two that are important and
sometimes easy to lose sight

00:24:41.310 --> 00:24:45.450
of are the two that
I indicate here.

00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:50.970
In particular, if we are mapping
a continuous time

00:24:50.970 --> 00:24:55.130
filter with, let's say, a
desired or desirable frequency

00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:59.680
response to a discrete time
filter and we would like to

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:03.360
preserve the good qualities of
that frequency response as we

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:09.460
look at the discrete time
frequency response, then it's

00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:14.680
important what happens in the
s-plane for the continuous

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:19.860
time filter along the j omega
axis relate in a nice way to

00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:24.310
what happens in the z-plane
around the unit circle,

00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:29.170
because it's this over here that
represents the frequency

00:25:29.170 --> 00:25:33.440
response in continuous time
and this contour over here

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:36.570
that represents the frequency
response in discrete time.

00:25:36.570 --> 00:25:38.090
So that's an important
property.

00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:41.100
We want to kind of the
j omega axis to

00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:44.370
map to the unit circle.

00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:49.160
Another more or less natural
condition to impose is a

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:53.960
condition that if we are assured
in some way that our

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:59.400
continuous time filter is
stable, then we would like to

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:02.510
concentrate on design procedures
that more or less

00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:07.550
preserve that and will give
us stable digital filters.

00:26:07.550 --> 00:26:11.150
So these are kind of reasonable
conditions to

00:26:11.150 --> 00:26:13.150
impose on the procedure.

00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:16.960
What I'd like to do in the
remainder of this lecture is

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:22.040
look at two common procedures
for mapping continuous time

00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:25.370
filters to discrete
time filters.

00:26:25.370 --> 00:26:28.020
The first one that I want to
talk about is one that, in

00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:35.210
fact, is very frequently used,
and also one that, as we'll

00:26:35.210 --> 00:26:40.990
see for a variety of reasons,
is highly undesirable.

00:26:40.990 --> 00:26:44.930
The second is one that is also
frequently used, and as we'll

00:26:44.930 --> 00:26:50.280
see is, in certain situations,
very desirable.

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:53.830
The first one that I want to
talk about is the more or less

00:26:53.830 --> 00:27:00.260
intuitive simple procedure
of mapping a differential

00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:04.790
equation to a difference
equation by simply replacing

00:27:04.790 --> 00:27:07.265
derivatives by differences.

00:27:09.890 --> 00:27:13.870
The idea is that a derivative is
more or less a difference,

00:27:13.870 --> 00:27:16.390
and there's some dummy parameter
capital T that I've

00:27:16.390 --> 00:27:19.720
thrown in here, which I won't
focus too much on.

00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:24.870
But in any case, this seems
to have some plausibility.

00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:27.730
If we take the differential
equation and do this with all

00:27:27.730 --> 00:27:32.410
the derivatives, both in terms
of y of t and x of t, what

00:27:32.410 --> 00:27:36.560
we'll end up with is a
difference equation.

00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:42.540
Now what we can use are the
properties of the Laplace

00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:45.920
transform and the z-transform
to see what this means in

00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:47.440
terms of a mapping--

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:50.940
in particular, using the
differentiation property for

00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:52.390
Laplace transforms.

00:27:52.390 --> 00:27:56.970
In the Laplace transform domain,
we would have this.

00:27:56.970 --> 00:28:02.400
Using the properties for the
z-transform, the z-transform

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:04.740
of this expression
would be this.

00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:09.950
So, in effect, what it says is
that every place in the system

00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:12.370
function or in the differential
equation that we

00:28:12.370 --> 00:28:16.460
would be multiplying by s when
Laplace transformed.

00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:18.000
In the difference equation,
we would be

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.070
multiplying by this factor.

00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:26.840
In fact, what this means is
that the mapping from

00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:32.000
continuous time to discrete time
corresponds to taking the

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:38.200
system function and replacing
s wherever we see it by 1

00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:43.110
minus z to the minus 1 over
capital T. So if we have a

00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:47.400
system function in continuous
time and we map it to a

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:51.220
discrete time system function
this way by replacing

00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:55.700
derivatives by differences,
then that corresponds to

00:28:55.700 --> 00:29:01.390
replacing s by 1 minus z to the
minus 1 over capital T.

00:29:01.390 --> 00:29:06.190
Now we'll see shortly what this
mapping actually means

00:29:06.190 --> 00:29:09.980
more specifically in relating
the s-plane to the z-plane.

00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:13.370
Let me just quickly, because I
want to refer to this, also

00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:16.670
point to another procedure
very much like backward

00:29:16.670 --> 00:29:20.910
differences which corresponds
to replacing derivatives not

00:29:20.910 --> 00:29:23.770
by the backward differences
that I just showed, but by

00:29:23.770 --> 00:29:25.640
forward differences.

00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:29.600
In that case, then, the
mapping corresponds to

00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:36.030
replacing s by z to the minus
1 over capital T. It looks

00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:39.270
very similar to the
previous case.

00:29:39.270 --> 00:29:43.330
So there the relationship
between these system functions

00:29:43.330 --> 00:29:44.860
is what I indicate here.

00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:53.590
Let's just take a look at what
those mappings correspond to

00:29:53.590 --> 00:29:56.730
when we look at this
specifically in the s-plane

00:29:56.730 --> 00:29:59.250
and in the z-plane.

00:29:59.250 --> 00:30:04.920
What I show here is the s-plane,
and of course it's

00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:07.350
things on the left half of the
s-plane, poles on the left

00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:10.350
half of the s-plane that would
guarantee stability.

00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:14.340
It's the j omega axis the tells
us about the frequency

00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:21.630
response, and in the z-plane
it's the unit circle that

00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:24.490
tells us about the frequency
response.

00:30:24.490 --> 00:30:27.560
Things inside the unit circle,
or poles inside the unit

00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:30.170
circle, that guarantee
stability.

00:30:30.170 --> 00:30:35.310
Now the mapping from s-plane to
the z-plane corresponding

00:30:35.310 --> 00:30:40.660
to replacing derivatives by
backward differences in fact

00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:48.140
can be shown to correspond to
mapping the j omega axis not

00:30:48.140 --> 00:30:51.780
to the unit circle, but to the
little circle that I show

00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:55.230
here, which is inside
the unit circle.

00:30:55.230 --> 00:30:58.550
The left half of the
s-plane maps to the

00:30:58.550 --> 00:31:00.430
inside of that circle.

00:31:00.430 --> 00:31:01.210
What does that mean?

00:31:01.210 --> 00:31:06.500
That means that if we have a
really good frequency response

00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:11.150
characteristic along this
contour in the s-plane, we'll

00:31:11.150 --> 00:31:13.270
see that same frequency
response

00:31:13.270 --> 00:31:14.910
along this little circle.

00:31:14.910 --> 00:31:17.030
That's not the one that
we want, though--

00:31:17.030 --> 00:31:20.420
we would like to see that same
frequency response around the

00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:22.080
unit circle.

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:26.960
To emphasize this point even
more-- suppose, for example,

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:33.230
that we had a pair of poles in
our continuous time system

00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:36.000
function that looked
like this.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:42.610
Then, where they're likely to
end up in the z-plane is

00:31:42.610 --> 00:31:45.050
inside the unit circle,
of course.

00:31:45.050 --> 00:31:50.080
But if the poles here are close
to the j omega axis,

00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:53.930
that means that these poles will
be close to this circle,

00:31:53.930 --> 00:31:58.320
but in fact might be very far
away from the unit circle.

00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:01.530
What would happen, then, is
that if we saw in the

00:32:01.530 --> 00:32:06.220
continuous time filter a very
sharp resonance, the discrete

00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:08.900
time filter in fact might very
well have that resonance

00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:12.660
broadened considerably because
the poles are so far away from

00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:14.500
the unit circle.

00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:19.530
Now, one plus with this method,
and it's about the

00:32:19.530 --> 00:32:25.570
only one, is the fact that the
left half of the s-plane maps

00:32:25.570 --> 00:32:30.110
inside the unit circle-- in
fact, inside a circle inside

00:32:30.110 --> 00:32:32.250
the unit circle, and so
stability is always

00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:33.870
guaranteed.

00:32:33.870 --> 00:32:36.170
Let me just quickly mention,
and you'll have a chance to

00:32:36.170 --> 00:32:38.910
look at this a little more
carefully in the video course

00:32:38.910 --> 00:32:42.960
manual, that for forward
differences instead of

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:51.120
backward differences, this
contour in the s-plane maps to

00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:56.380
a line in the z-plane, which is
a line tangent to the unit

00:32:56.380 --> 00:33:01.250
circle, and in fact is the
line that I showed there.

00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:05.890
So not only are forward
differences equally bad in

00:33:05.890 --> 00:33:09.270
terms of the issue of whether
they map from the j omega axis

00:33:09.270 --> 00:33:13.440
to the unit circle, but they
have a further difficulty

00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:19.360
associated with them, which is
the difficulty they may not

00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:21.505
and generally don't guarantee
stability.

00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:29.840
Now, that's one method, and one,
as I indicated, that's

00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:35.600
often used partly
because it seems

00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:37.510
so intuitively plausible.

00:33:37.510 --> 00:33:40.960
What you can see is that by
understanding carefully the

00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:44.500
issues and the techniques of
Laplace and z-transforms, you

00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:48.280
can begin to see what some of
the difficulties with those

00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:50.450
methods are.

00:33:50.450 --> 00:33:54.080
The next method that I'd like
to talk about is a method

00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:57.000
that, in fact, is very
commonly used.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:01.360
It's a very important, useful
method, which kind of can be

00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:06.330
motivated by thinking along
the lines of mapping the

00:34:06.330 --> 00:34:11.630
continuous time filter to a
discrete time filter in such a

00:34:11.630 --> 00:34:15.580
way that the shape of the
impulse response is

00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:16.620
preserved--

00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:20.989
and, in fact, more specifically
so that the

00:34:20.989 --> 00:34:26.590
discrete time impulse response
corresponds to samples of the

00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:28.960
continuous time impulse
response.

00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:32.800
And this is a method that's
referred to as impulse

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:35.260
invariance.

00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:40.790
So what impulse invariance
corresponds to is designing

00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:46.100
the filter in such a way that
the discrete time filter

00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:51.550
impulse response is simply
a sample version of the

00:34:51.550 --> 00:34:57.200
continuous time filter impulse
response with a sampling

00:34:57.200 --> 00:35:01.450
period which I denote here as
capital T. That will turn into

00:35:01.450 --> 00:35:06.350
a slightly confusing parameter
shortly, and perhaps carried

00:35:06.350 --> 00:35:08.270
over into the next lecture.

00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:11.900
Hopefully, we'll get that
straighted out, though, within

00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:14.030
those two lectures.

00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:18.680
Remembering the issues of
sampling, the discrete time

00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:22.970
frequency response, then since
the frequency responses the

00:35:22.970 --> 00:35:27.180
Fourier transform of the impulse
response is related to

00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:31.950
the continuous time impulse
response as I indicate here,

00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:41.130
what this says is that it
is the superposition of

00:35:41.130 --> 00:35:46.600
replications of the continuous
time frequency response,

00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:51.440
linearly scaled in frequency
and shifted and

00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:53.120
added to each other.

00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:56.830
It's the same old sort of
shifting, adding, or aliasing

00:35:56.830 --> 00:35:58.430
issue-- the same sampling
issues that

00:35:58.430 --> 00:36:01.740
we've addressed before.

00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:04.690
This equation will help us
understand what the frequency

00:36:04.690 --> 00:36:06.290
response looks like.

00:36:06.290 --> 00:36:11.560
But in terms of an analytical
procedure for mapping the

00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:14.540
continuous time system function
to a discrete time

00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:20.020
system function, we can see
that and develop it in the

00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:22.200
following way.

00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:27.000
Let's consider the continuous
time system function expanded

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:30.250
in a partial fraction
expansion.

00:36:30.250 --> 00:36:33.320
And just for convenience, I'm
picking first order poles--

00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:44.540
this can be generalized multiple
order poles, and we

00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:45.730
won't do that here.

00:36:45.730 --> 00:36:48.200
The same basic strategy
applies.

00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:54.120
If we expand this in a partial
fraction expansion, and we

00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:57.210
look at the impulse response
associated with this-- we know

00:36:57.210 --> 00:36:59.940
how to take the inverse of
Laplace transform of this,

00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:03.280
where I'm just naturally
assuming causality throughout

00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:05.490
the discussion--

00:37:05.490 --> 00:37:09.070
the continuous time impulse
response, then, is the sum of

00:37:09.070 --> 00:37:14.610
exponentials with these
amplitudes and at these

00:37:14.610 --> 00:37:17.910
complex exponential
frequencies.

00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:21.570
Now, impulse invariance
corresponds to sampling this,

00:37:21.570 --> 00:37:26.090
and so the discrete time impulse
response is simply a

00:37:26.090 --> 00:37:29.700
sampled version of this.

00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:33.720
The A sub k, of course,
carries down.

00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:35.440
We have the exponential--

00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:39.340
we're sampling at t equals
n capital T, and so we've

00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:43.550
replaced that here, and then
the unit step to truncate

00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:46.550
things for negative time.

00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:50.360
Let's manipulate this further,
and eventually what we want to

00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:52.530
get is a relationship--

00:37:52.530 --> 00:37:53.230
a mapping--

00:37:53.230 --> 00:37:58.360
from the continuous time to
the discrete time filter.

00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:04.380
We have this step, and we can
rewrite that now as I show

00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:08.860
here, just simply taking this
n outside, and we have e to

00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:13.770
the s sub k capital T. Now this
is of the form the sum of

00:38:13.770 --> 00:38:19.100
terms like A sub k times
is beta to the n.

00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:23.750
We can compute the z-transform
of this, and the z-transform

00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:26.840
that we get I show here--

00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:30.680
it's simply A sub k over 1 minus
e to the s sub k capital

00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:36.700
T z to the minus 1, simply
carrying this term or this

00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:39.720
parameter down.

00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:42.750
So we started with a continuous
time system

00:38:42.750 --> 00:38:46.800
function, which was a sum of
terms like A sub k over s

00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:49.730
minus s sub k-- the poles
were at s sub k.

00:38:49.730 --> 00:38:54.200
We now have the discrete time
filter in this form.

00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:57.110
Consequently, then, this
procedure of impulse

00:38:57.110 --> 00:39:03.400
invariance corresponds to
mapping the continuous time

00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:07.840
filter to a discrete time filter
by mapping the poles in

00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:10.080
the continuous time filter.

00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:15.870
According to this mapping, the
continuous time filter pole at

00:39:15.870 --> 00:39:20.530
s sub k gets mapped to a pole
e to the s sub k capital T,

00:39:20.530 --> 00:39:27.280
and the coefficients A
sub k are preserved.

00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:31.210
That, then, algebraically, is
what the procedure of impulse

00:39:31.210 --> 00:39:34.960
invariance corresponds to.

00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:39.630
Let's look at how we interpret
some of this in

00:39:39.630 --> 00:39:42.180
the frequency domain.

00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:49.020
In particular, we have the
expression that tells us how

00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:54.700
the discrete time frequency
response is related to the

00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:57.470
continuous time frequency
response.

00:39:57.470 --> 00:40:02.570
This is the expression that we
had previously when we had

00:40:02.570 --> 00:40:05.490
talked about issues
of sampling.

00:40:05.490 --> 00:40:07.910
So that means that we would
form the discrete time

00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:12.460
frequency response by taking the
continuous time 1, scaling

00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:17.100
it in frequency according to
this parameter capital T, and

00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:21.190
then adding replications
of that together.

00:40:21.190 --> 00:40:26.890
So if this is the continuous
time frequency response, just

00:40:26.890 --> 00:40:30.460
simply an ideal low-pass filter
with a cutoff frequency

00:40:30.460 --> 00:40:36.400
of omega sub c, then the
frequency scaling operation

00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:42.130
would keep the same basic shape
but linearly scale the

00:40:42.130 --> 00:40:47.600
frequency axis so that we now
have omega sub c times T. Then

00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:52.060
the discrete time frequency
response would be a

00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:57.400
superposition of these added
together at multiples of 2 pi

00:40:57.400 --> 00:41:00.190
in discrete time frequency.

00:41:00.190 --> 00:41:03.350
So that's what we have here--

00:41:03.350 --> 00:41:06.245
so this is the discrete time
frequency response.

00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:11.810
This looks very nice-- it looks
like impulse invariance

00:41:11.810 --> 00:41:15.610
will take the continuous time
frequency response, just

00:41:15.610 --> 00:41:18.470
simply linearly scale the
frequency axis, and

00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:21.210
incidentally periodically
repeat it.

00:41:21.210 --> 00:41:24.360
We know that for an ideal
low-pass filter,

00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:25.670
that looks just fine.

00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:28.940
In fact, for a band-limited
frequency response,

00:41:28.940 --> 00:41:31.300
that looks just fine.

00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:35.355
But we know also that any time
that we're sampling--

00:41:35.355 --> 00:41:38.210
and here we're sampling
the impulse response--

00:41:38.210 --> 00:41:42.210
we have an effect in the
frequency domain or the

00:41:42.210 --> 00:41:44.440
potential for an affect
an effect that

00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:46.710
we refer to as aliasing.

00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:52.810
So in fact, if instead of the
ideal low-pass filter we had

00:41:52.810 --> 00:41:56.030
taken a filter that was an
approximation to a low-pass

00:41:56.030 --> 00:42:01.510
filter, then the corresponding
frequency scale version would

00:42:01.510 --> 00:42:03.590
look as I've shown here.

00:42:03.590 --> 00:42:08.390
And now as we add these
together, then what we will

00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:13.070
have is some potential for
distortion corresponding to

00:42:13.070 --> 00:42:17.530
the fact that these replications
overlap, and what

00:42:17.530 --> 00:42:19.660
that will lead to is aliasing.

00:42:22.330 --> 00:42:26.720
So some things that we can say
about impulse invariance is

00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:29.270
that we have an algebraic
procedure--

00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:32.370
and I'll illustrate with another
example shortly--

00:42:32.370 --> 00:42:35.200
for taking a continuous time
system function and mapping it

00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:37.680
to a discrete time
system function.

00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:44.290
It has a very nice property in
terms of mapping, the mapping

00:42:44.290 --> 00:42:48.910
from the frequency axis in
continuous time due to the

00:42:48.910 --> 00:42:50.190
unit circle--

00:42:50.190 --> 00:42:53.750
namely, to a first
approximation.

00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:57.900
As long as there's no aliasing,
the mapping is just

00:42:57.900 --> 00:43:01.200
simply a linear scaling of the
frequency axis, although there

00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:02.910
may be some aliasing.

00:43:02.910 --> 00:43:06.640
That means, of course, that this
method can only be used

00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:09.810
if the frequency response that's
being mapped, or if the

00:43:09.810 --> 00:43:13.300
system that's being mapped,
has a frequency response

00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:15.300
that's approximately
low-pass--

00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:16.940
it has to be approximately
band-limited.

00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:23.970
Then what we have is some of
potential distortion, which

00:43:23.970 --> 00:43:26.540
comes about because
of aliasing.

00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:30.660
Also because of the mapping, the
fact that poles at s sub k

00:43:30.660 --> 00:43:36.290
get mapped to poles at e to the
s sub k capital T, if the

00:43:36.290 --> 00:43:39.960
analog or continuous time
filter is stable--

00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:43.050
meaning that the real part
of s sub k is negative--

00:43:43.050 --> 00:43:47.240
then the discrete time filter
is guaranteed to be stable.

00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:51.220
In other words, the magnitude of
z sub k will be guaranteed

00:43:51.220 --> 00:43:53.060
to be less than 1.

00:43:53.060 --> 00:43:56.300
I'm assuming, of course, in that
discussion that we are

00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:58.730
always imposing causality
on the systems.

00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:06.030
To just look at the algebraic
mapping a little more

00:44:06.030 --> 00:44:09.650
carefully, let's take
a simple example.

00:44:09.650 --> 00:44:15.130
Here is an example of a system,
a continuous time

00:44:15.130 --> 00:44:21.690
system, where I simply have a
resident pole pair with an

00:44:21.690 --> 00:44:26.000
imaginary part along the
imaginary axis of omega sub r

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:28.660
and a real part of
minus alpha.

00:44:28.660 --> 00:44:34.650
And so the associated system
function then is just the

00:44:34.650 --> 00:44:39.110
expression which incorporates
the two poles, and I've put in

00:44:39.110 --> 00:44:42.850
a scale factor of
2 omega sub r.

00:44:42.850 --> 00:44:47.160
And now to design the discrete
time filter using impulse

00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:49.990
invariance, you would carry
out a partial fraction

00:44:49.990 --> 00:44:53.690
expansion of this, and that
partial fraction expansion is

00:44:53.690 --> 00:44:55.990
shown below.

00:44:55.990 --> 00:44:59.550
We have a pole at minus alpha
minus j omega r and at minus

00:44:59.550 --> 00:45:02.130
alpha plus j omega r.

00:45:02.130 --> 00:45:07.430
And to determine the discrete
time filter based on impulse

00:45:07.430 --> 00:45:10.640
invariance, we would map the
poles and preserve the

00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:14.480
coefficients a sub k, referred
to as the residues.

00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:18.740
And so the discrete time filter
that we would end up

00:45:18.740 --> 00:45:25.560
with as a system function,
which I indicate here--

00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:30.870
and we have, as I said,
preserved the residue, and the

00:45:30.870 --> 00:45:34.820
pole is now at a to the minus
alpha T, e to the minus j

00:45:34.820 --> 00:45:40.020
omega sub r T. That's one term,
and the other term in

00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:44.950
the sum has a pole at the
complex conjugate location.

00:45:44.950 --> 00:45:50.090
If we were to add these two
factors together, then what we

00:45:50.090 --> 00:45:57.420
would get is both poles
and a 0 at the origin.

00:45:57.420 --> 00:46:04.270
In fact, then, the pole is
defined by its angle, and this

00:46:04.270 --> 00:46:15.050
angle is e to the j omega sub
r capital T, and by its

00:46:15.050 --> 00:46:24.030
radius, and this radius is e to
the minus alpha capital T.

00:46:24.030 --> 00:46:28.310
Now we can look at the frequency
response associated

00:46:28.310 --> 00:46:31.600
with that, and let's
just do that.

00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:40.730
For the original continuous time
frequency response, what

00:46:40.730 --> 00:46:45.900
we have is simply a resonant
character, as I've shown here.

00:46:45.900 --> 00:46:50.730
And if we map this using impulse
invariance, which we

00:46:50.730 --> 00:46:56.920
just did, the resulting
frequency response that we get

00:46:56.920 --> 00:46:59.670
is the frequency response
which I indicate.

00:46:59.670 --> 00:47:03.920
We see that that's basically
identical to the continuous

00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:09.430
time frequency response, except
for a linear scaling in

00:47:09.430 --> 00:47:13.510
the frequency axis, if you just
compare the dimensions

00:47:13.510 --> 00:47:21.210
along which the frequency axis
is shown except for one minor

00:47:21.210 --> 00:47:25.500
issue, which is particularly
highlighted when we look at

00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:30.180
the frequency response at
higher frequencies.

00:47:30.180 --> 00:47:35.140
What's the reason why those two
curves don't quite follow

00:47:35.140 --> 00:47:38.980
each other at higher
frequencies?

00:47:38.980 --> 00:47:41.790
Well, the reason is aliasing.

00:47:41.790 --> 00:47:44.980
In other words, what's happened
is that in the

00:47:44.980 --> 00:47:50.320
process so applying impulse
invariance, the frequency

00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:53.770
response of the original
continuous time filter is

00:47:53.770 --> 00:47:57.540
approximately preserved, except
for some distortion,

00:47:57.540 --> 00:48:01.420
that distortion corresponding
to aliasing.

00:48:01.420 --> 00:48:06.000
Well, just for comparison,
let's look at what would

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:08.490
happen if we took the
same example--

00:48:08.490 --> 00:48:10.710
and we're not going to work
it through here carefully.

00:48:10.710 --> 00:48:15.100
We're not work it through it
all, not even not carefully.

00:48:15.100 --> 00:48:19.560
If we took the same example and
mapped it to a discrete

00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:22.720
time filter by replacing
derivatives by backward

00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:28.200
differences, what happens in
that case is that we get a

00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:32.030
frequency response that
I indicate here.

00:48:32.030 --> 00:48:36.720
Notice that the resonance in the
original continuous time

00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:41.020
filter is totally lost.

00:48:41.020 --> 00:48:44.950
In fact, basically the character
of the continuous

00:48:44.950 --> 00:48:47.510
time frequency response
is lost.

00:48:47.510 --> 00:48:48.410
What's the reason?

00:48:48.410 --> 00:48:49.920
Well, the reason goes
back to the

00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:51.810
picture that I drew before.

00:48:51.810 --> 00:48:58.920
The continuous time filter had a
pair of resident poles close

00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:00.830
to the j omega axis.

00:49:00.830 --> 00:49:03.850
When those get mapped using
backward differences, they end

00:49:03.850 --> 00:49:07.850
up close to this little circle
that's inside the unit circle,

00:49:07.850 --> 00:49:10.700
but in fact for this example,
are far away

00:49:10.700 --> 00:49:11.950
from the unit circle.

00:49:16.350 --> 00:49:20.320
So far we have one useful
technique for mapping

00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:23.600
continuous time filters to
discrete time filters.

00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:27.160
In part to highlight some
of the issues, I focused

00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:31.780
attention also on some not
so useful methods--

00:49:31.780 --> 00:49:35.410
namely, mapping derivatives
to forward or backward

00:49:35.410 --> 00:49:37.630
differences.

00:49:37.630 --> 00:49:43.360
Next time what I would like
to do is look at impulse

00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:46.470
invariance for another
example--

00:49:46.470 --> 00:49:51.360
namely, the design of a
Butterworth filter, and I'll

00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:54.970
talk more specifically about
what Butterworth filters are

00:49:54.970 --> 00:49:57.550
at the beginning of
that lecture.

00:49:57.550 --> 00:50:01.170
Then, in addition, what we'll
introduce is another very

00:50:01.170 --> 00:50:05.600
useful technique, which has
some difficulties which

00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:11.360
impulse invariance doesn't have,
but avoids the principal

00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:13.480
difficulty that impulse
invariance does have--

00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:14.950
namely, aliasing.

00:50:14.950 --> 00:50:19.880
That method is referred to the
bilinear transformation, which

00:50:19.880 --> 00:50:24.090
we will define and utilize
next time.

00:50:24.090 --> 00:50:25.340
Thank you.
