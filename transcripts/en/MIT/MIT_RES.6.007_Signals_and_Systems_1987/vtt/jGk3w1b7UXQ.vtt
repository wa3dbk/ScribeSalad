00:00:59.745 --> 00:01:02.330
PROFESSOR: in the last
lecture, we discussed

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.370
sinusoidal and real and complex
exponential signals

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.110
both for continuous time
and discrete time.

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.520
And those signals will form very
important building blocks

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.100
when we return to a discussion
of Fourier

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.540
analysis in a later lecture.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.830
In today's lecture, I'd like to
introduce some additional

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.480
basic signals, specifically
the unit step and

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.830
unit impulse signal.

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.760
Let's begin with discrete time
and the discrete-time unit

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.820
step and unit impulse.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.740
The discrete-time unit step is
a sequence as I've indicated

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:50.570
here, specifically a sequence
which is 0 for negative values

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:56.520
of its argument, and equal to
1 for positive values of its

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.970
argument and 0.

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:06.230
So mathematically, the unit
step sequence is 1 for n

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:10.460
greater than or equal to 0
and 0 for n less than 0.

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.730
The unit impulse sequence,
likewise, is defined in a

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.430
straightforward way.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:25.630
The unit impulse sequence is a
sequence which is 0 for all

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:31.210
values of its argument
except for n = 0.

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.520
So the unit step and unit
impulse sequence are defined

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.210
in a straightforward
way mathematically.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:42.430
And in fact, they are also
related to each other in a

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.170
straightforward way
mathematically.

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.050
Specifically, the unit impulse
can be related to the unit

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:55.590
step through the relationship
that I've indicated here--

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:01.000
delta of n, the unit impulse,
equal to a unit step minus the

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.740
unit step delayed.

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.930
So mathematically, the
relationship is what is

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.075
referred to as a first
difference.

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.330
And to see the validity of this
expression, we can simply

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:24.380
look at the unit step and
its delayed version.

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.400
So here, we show the
unit step, u[n].

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.060
Here, we show the unit
step delayed by 1.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.890
So it's 0 for n less
than or equal to 0.

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.700
And clearly, if we subtract
the delayed step from the

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:49.350
original unit step, everything
subtracts out except at n = 0,

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.070
at which point the difference
is equal to 1.

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:55.540
And so the difference
between u[n]

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.430
and u[n-1]

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.180
is simply the unit impulse,
sometimes incidentally also

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:03.880
referred to as the
unit sample.

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:12.500
Now, in a similar way, we can
express the unit step in terms

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:13.550
of the unit impulse.

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:16.579
And there are several
ways of doing this.

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:21.110
One way is through a
relationship referred to as a

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:23.080
running sum.

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.740
What I mean by that is the
following expression.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:37.960
If we think of forming the sum
from minus infinity up to some

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:45.620
value n of a unit impulse or
unit sample, then this running

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:50.480
sum, in fact, is equal
to the unit step.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:55.000
And we can see that in a fairly
straightforward way, by

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.260
simply observing that in this
expression, when n is less

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.750
than 0, there's nothing
accumulated in the sum.

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.530
And we can see that graphically

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:09.880
as I've shown here.

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.530
So for n less than 0,
so we accumulate no

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:14.340
terms in the sum.

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:20.800
Whereas for n greater than 0, we
accumulate 1 non-zero value

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:26.900
in the sum, namely the value of
the unit sample at n = 0.

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:30.520
So we have, then, one
expression for the

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.700
relationship between the unit
step and the unit sample.

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:41.810
We can also develop another
relationship by observing in

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:46.460
essence that if we look at the
unit step sequence, as I've

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:51.850
returned to here, we can, in
effect, think of the unit step

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:56.890
sequence as a succession
of unit impulses,

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:00.320
one following another.

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:14.270
So if we consider forming a sum
of delayed impulses, as I

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:18.430
indicate mathematically here,
and as I indicate graphically

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:24.680
down below, we have an impulse
here at n = 0 and an impulse

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:30.160
here at n = 1, an impulse here
at n = 2, et cetera.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:34.930
And when we continue to add
these up, then what they add

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:39.740
up to is the unit
step sequence.

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:43.840
And so mathematically, then,
that would correspond to an

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:48.640
impulse at n = 0 plus an impulse
at n = 1 plus an

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:50.960
impulse at n = 2, et cetera.

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:57.980
Now, in continuous time, we
have a very more or less

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:00.270
similar situation.

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:05.330
We will find it equally useful
to talk about a unit step

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:08.540
continuous-time signal
and a unit impulse

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:10.550
continuous-time signal.

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:16.670
Let's begin with the
continuous-time unit step.

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:22.090
The continuous-time unit step
function is graphically

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:24.870
indicated as I've shown here.

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:30.850
It's a time function which
is 0 for t less than 0.

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:34.360
And it's 1 for t
greater than 0.

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:38.970
And so mathematically, what
it corresponds to is u[t]

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:44.720
t defined as a time function
which is 0 for t less than 0,

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:48.250
1 for t greater than 0.

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:53.710
Now, an obvious question is,
what happens at t = 0?

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:56.890
And the difficulty here-- which
is not a difficulty that

00:07:56.890 --> 00:07:59.360
arises in the discrete-time
case--

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:03.550
is that at t = 0, the units
step function is in fact

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:06.770
discontinuous, which generates
a variety of

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:08.460
mathematical problems.

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:14.350
And one can define the unit step
at t = 0 in a variety of

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:19.020
ways, but the essential point is
that the unit step function

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:21.220
is discontinuous.

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:25.190
So in effect, what we need to
do is think of the unit step

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:29.980
function as the limit of
a continuous function.

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:34.549
And so we can define a function,
which I specify here

00:08:34.549 --> 00:08:38.480
as u_delta(t) (u sub
delta of t).

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:44.420
And u_delta(t) is a time
function which is 0 for t less

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:49.950
than 0, linearly increases
to time delta which would

00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:52.720
correspond to this
break point, and

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:55.450
then 1 following that.

00:08:55.450 --> 00:09:01.620
And so we can think then of the
discontinuous unit step as

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:08.350
the limiting form of u_delta(t)
as delta goes to 0.

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:13.880
Now, we also want to define
a unit impulse function.

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:16.880
And it had a fairly
straightforward definition in

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:17.840
discrete time.

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:22.130
In continuous time, things get
slightly more difficult.

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:25.370
And to motivate the definition,
let me return to

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:28.980
the discrete-time definition--

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:33.130
or rather, the discrete-time
relationship between the unit

00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:37.010
step and the unit impulse
function.

00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:44.660
In discrete time, we saw that
the unit impulse function is

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:50.790
the first difference of the
unit step function.

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:56.400
Well, similarly in continuous
time, we can talk about an

00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:02.560
impulse function, which is the
first derivative of a unit

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:05.030
step function.

00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:09.320
So the unit impulse, as we
want to define it, is the

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:11.850
derivative of the unit step.

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:15.640
Of course, we just finished
discussing the fact that the

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:21.710
unit step function is, in fact,
discontinuous at t = 0.

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:26.960
But we can think of its
derivative as related to this

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:29.840
approximation to
the unit step.

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:34.310
And specifically, we will think
of the continuous-time

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:42.540
impulse as the derivative of
u_delta(t) as delta goes to 0.

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:47.590
So to define the unit impulse,
we think of the derivative of

00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:51.950
this approximation to the unit
step and then observe what

00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:55.440
happens as delta goes to 0.

00:10:55.440 --> 00:11:04.270
We have, then, the definition
of the unit impulse function

00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:09.100
more or less formally defined as
the first derivative of the

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:17.320
unit step, or thought of as
the limiting form of the

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:22.360
derivative of the approximation
to the unit step

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:27.380
in the limit, as delta,
the duration of the

00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:29.210
discontinuity, goes to 0.

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:35.780
Well, let's look at that.

00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:42.820
If we think about the derivative
of u_delta(t), the

00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:47.230
derivative, of course, is
0 for t less than 0.

00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:51.270
It's equal to a constant during
this linear slope, and

00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:55.220
then, it's 0 for t greater
than delta.

00:11:55.220 --> 00:12:01.070
So the derivative of u_delta(t)
will then be as

00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:04.000
I've indicated here.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.110
And it's simply a rectangle with
a height, which is 1 /

00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:13.260
delta, and a width, which
is equal to delta.

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:17.460
And observe that no matter what
the value of delta is,

00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:22.260
the area is always equal to 1.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:27.340
Now, as we let delta go to 0,
what happens is that the width

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:30.270
of the rectangle gets smaller,
the height of the rectangle

00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:33.900
gets bigger, the area
still remains 1.

00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:38.210
As delta goes to 0, of course,
the width goes to 0, and the

00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:40.470
height goes to infinity.

00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:48.550
And graphically, we choose to
depict that as an arrow, where

00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:53.240
the arrow indicates the fact
that we have an impulse

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:58.890
occurring at t = 0, and the
height of the impulse is used

00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:03.380
to represent what the area
of the impulse is.

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:06.350
And in this case, since we took
the derivative of a unit

00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:10.010
step, the height
is equal to 1.

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:19.360
So the impulse has 0 width,
infinite height, area 1.

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:24.060
It's mathematically not terribly
comfortable because

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:27.310
what we've done is taken the
derivative of the unit step,

00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:30.970
which has a discontinuity at the
origin, and there's some

00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:33.780
mathematical difficulties
in doing that.

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:37.700
We'll in fact return to another
interpretation of the

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:43.990
impulse later to emphasize some
of the discomfort with

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:45.460
the impulse.

00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:49.820
I remember something that Sam
Mason used to say that his

00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:52.990
students said about
the unit impulse.

00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:56.810
His definition was the unit
impulse is something that's so

00:13:56.810 --> 00:14:00.470
small every place I can't see
it except at one point where

00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:01.870
it's so big I can't see it.

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:04.090
In other words, I
can't see it at.

00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:10.440
Well, accept some informality
with the unit impulse function

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:15.410
in the continuous time case, and
generally, we'll see that

00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:17.505
we won't get into particular
difficulty.

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:25.230
OK, now the impulse is the
derivative of the step.

00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:29.510
We saw in the discrete-time case
that the step could be

00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:32.952
recovered from the impulse
through a running sum.

00:14:32.952 --> 00:14:36.250
In continuous time, if the
impulse is the derivative of a

00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:39.900
step, we would more or less
reasonably expect that the

00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:43.420
step would be like an integral
of the impulse.

00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:45.370
And indeed, that's true.

00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:52.350
In fact, mathematically the
relationship is that the unit

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:59.340
step function in continuous time
is the running integral

00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:02.230
of the unit impulse function.

00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:07.330
And so it's the integral from
minus infinity up to time t,

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:13.900
where t is the argument at which
we're examining u(t).

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:20.270
And so, just as with the
discrete-time case, if we are

00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:24.580
looking at t less than 0,
there's no area accumulated in

00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:25.780
the integral.

00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:29.620
If we're looking at t greater
than 0, then we accumulate the

00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:31.255
area under the impulse.

00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:43.160
OK, now we'll shortly be
returning to a further

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:48.390
discussion on use of impulses
and step functions.

00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:52.580
And in particular, what we'll
see is that they provide a

00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:58.300
very convenient and powerful
mechanism for describing a

00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:01.900
particular class of systems
referred to as linear

00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:04.650
time-invariant systems.

00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:07.710
To lead up to that discussion,
which will be the principal

00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:12.470
focus of the next lecture, let's
for the remainder of

00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:15.980
this lecture talk about systems
in general and then

00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:17.860
some properties of systems.

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:23.380
And as the lecture proceeds, the
specific properties that I

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:26.085
want to get to are properties
of linearity and time

00:16:26.085 --> 00:16:28.010
invariance.

00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:31.820
So let's first talk about
systems in general.

00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:36.850
And a system in general, in its
most general definition,

00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:41.770
is simply a transformation from
an input signal to an

00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:43.840
output signal.

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:48.360
So in a continuous-time
case, we would have a

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:53.740
continuous-time system,
the input, x[t],

00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:56.140
and the output, y[t].

00:16:56.140 --> 00:17:00.410
And the box, in essence,
is used to denote a

00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:02.600
transformation from x[t]

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:04.740
to y[t].

00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:09.079
And sometimes, we'll also use a
shorthand notation along the

00:17:09.079 --> 00:17:14.240
lines of indicating that the
input, x[t], is transformed to

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:17.700
the output, y[t].

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:21.540
Now, we have exactly the same
kind of definition in the

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:23.349
discrete-time case.

00:17:23.349 --> 00:17:27.020
In the discrete-time case,
of course, the inputs are

00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:31.000
sequences, and the outputs
are sequences.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.450
And our shorthand notation
is similar.

00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:39.280
Often when we talk about
systems, we'll want to talk

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:41.380
about interconnections
of systems.

00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:45.080
And we'll see again in later
lectures that interconnections

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:48.080
become very important
and powerful.

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:53.660
And in the way of introducing
terminology, let me introduce

00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:56.490
the terminology for a few
basic and important

00:17:56.490 --> 00:17:59.840
interconnections of systems.

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:07.230
The first is what's referred to
as a cascade of systems, or

00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:11.110
sometimes as a series
interconnection of systems.

00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:14.720
And putting two systems in
cascade, as I've indicated

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:19.860
here, means taking the output
of one system--

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:21.780
let's say system 1--

00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:25.890
and using that as the input to
the second system, which I've

00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:27.880
denoted as system 2.

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:34.420
So in this cascade with system
1 first and system 2 second,

00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:37.740
we have the output of system
1 going into the

00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:40.710
input of system 2.

00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:46.000
Now, we could, of course, take
those two systems and cascade

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.570
them in the reverse order.

00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:52.630
Namely, take the output of
system 2 and put it into the

00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:54.650
input of system 1.

00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:56.995
And I've indicated that here.

00:18:56.995 --> 00:19:00.330
And we have system 2 first
in the cascade

00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:04.440
followed by system 1.

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:09.370
It's important to keep in mind
that in general, for general

00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:13.480
systems, the order in which
you cascade the systems is

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:15.440
very important.

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:19.640
And in fact, the overall system
transformation will be

00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:22.710
different depending on which
system came first and which

00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:24.840
system came second.

00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:29.130
For example, if system 1 was,
let's say, a system for which

00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:35.390
the output doubles the input,
and system 2, the output is

00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:39.550
the square root of the input,
clearly doubling first and

00:19:39.550 --> 00:19:43.080
then taking the square root is
different than taking the

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:46.680
square root first and
then doubling.

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:52.570
Now, kind of amazingly, what
we'll see again when we get to

00:19:52.570 --> 00:19:55.140
this issue of linearity
and time invariance--

00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:58.340
which are a class of systems
that we'll focus in on--

00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:02.640
somewhat amazingly, it turns
out that for that specific

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:07.480
class of systems, the overall
system transformation is

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:09.680
independent of the
order in which

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:12.280
the systems are cascaded.

00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:16.280
And we'll see that, of course,
in more detail later on.

00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:19.110
All right, well, that's
a cascade or a series

00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:20.970
interconnection.

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:24.240
Let's look at another
interconnection, which is a

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:27.270
parallel interconnection
of systems.

00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:33.110
And here, what's meant by the
interconnection is that the

00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:39.220
input is fed simultaneously
into system 1

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:42.260
and into system 2.

00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:47.410
And then, the outputs of these
two systems are added to give

00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:50.900
the overall system output.

00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:57.670
Now, in this particular case,
in contrast to a cascade, no

00:20:57.670 --> 00:21:02.710
matter what the systems are, it
turns out that a parallel

00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:06.520
combination, the order
in which they're

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:09.740
put in parallel is--

00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:13.660
the overall transformation is
independent of the order.

00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:16.230
And of course, that follows
from the fact that we're

00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:18.460
simply adding up outputs.

00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:22.120
And the outputs can be added
in any order because of the

00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:25.000
fact that addition doesn't care
in which order you're

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.840
adding things up.

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:30.880
OK, so that's the parallel
interconnection.

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:35.460
And let's look at one more
interconnection, which is

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:39.320
what's referred to as a feedback
interconnection.

00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:43.530
And this, again, is an
interconnection that will

00:21:43.530 --> 00:21:47.320
become a very important topic
much later in the course.

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:51.940
But let me just indicate at this
point what I mean by it.

00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:55.000
What a feedback interconnection
means is that

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:05.090
we have one system, system 1,
with an input and an output.

00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:09.710
The output of system 1 is the
output of the overall system.

00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:16.120
And that output is fed
into system 2.

00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:22.260
The output of system 2 is then
added to the input to the

00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:23.860
overall system.

00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:27.790
So in essence, what happens in
a feedback interconnection is

00:22:27.790 --> 00:22:29.910
we have one system.

00:22:29.910 --> 00:22:35.410
The output of that system is
fed back through system 2,

00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:37.290
added to the overall input.

00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:40.770
And then, that sum is what forms
the input of system 1.

00:22:40.770 --> 00:22:45.870
And we'll see that there are
lots of uses for feedback and,

00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:49.680
of course, also lots of ways
that feedback gets in the way.

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:53.700
In fact, probably some of you
are already familiar with some

00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:55.580
of the issues in feedback--

00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:57.910
for example, in audio
systems or whatever.

00:22:57.910 --> 00:23:01.750
But this will be a topic that
we'll devote a considerable

00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:05.580
amount of time to later
in the course.

00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:10.170
And then, of course, there are
lots of other interconnections

00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:12.640
of systems.

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:15.900
And as the course progresses,
we'll see lots of ways in

00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:19.270
which systems get interconnected
both in series

00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:22.700
and in parallel and feedback
interconnections, et cetera,

00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:28.040
to achieve a wide variety
of things.

00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:33.720
Now, what I've said so far
relates to systems in general.

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:37.240
And you can't say much about
systems when you try to treat

00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:39.470
them in their most
general form.

00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:44.845
So it's useful and important to
focus in on properties that

00:23:44.845 --> 00:23:47.160
a system may or may not have.

00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:51.730
So what I'd like to do now is
turn our attention to system

00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:53.000
properties.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.120
And we'll define a
number of them.

00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:59.220
Some of them, we'll want
to impose on a system.

00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:02.460
Some of them, we may not want
to impose on a system.

00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:08.810
But as things progress, we'll
tend to find it useful to ask

00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:10.540
whether a system
does or doesn't

00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:13.200
have a certain property.

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:18.640
Well, let's begin with a
property which I refer to here

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:20.690
as memoryless.

00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:26.540
And what I mean by a system
being memoryless is that the

00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:35.590
output at any given time, t_0,
depends only on the input at

00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:36.550
the same time.

00:24:36.550 --> 00:24:41.560
And so what I'm suggesting is
that a memoryless system is

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:48.320
one for which the output at a
specific time depends only on

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:50.520
the input at that time.

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:56.080
And that statement is true, or
that definition applies, both

00:24:56.080 --> 00:25:03.130
for continuous time, as I've
indicated here, and also for

00:25:03.130 --> 00:25:05.390
discrete time, as I've
indicated here.

00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:10.670
And so we have a similar
definition in discrete time,

00:25:10.670 --> 00:25:16.650
that the system is memoryless
if the output at any given

00:25:16.650 --> 00:25:20.750
time depends only on the
input at that time.

00:25:23.490 --> 00:25:27.000
Well, I have a number
of examples here.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.760
Let's look at the first example
in which the output is

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:33.520
the square of the input.

00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:39.170
And that is a possible system
either in continuous time or

00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:40.680
discrete time.

00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:45.410
And that system, as you would
expect, is commonly referred

00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:48.670
to a squarer.

00:25:48.670 --> 00:25:53.480
And since the square of a signal
at any time depends

00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:58.220
only on the value of the signal
at that time, clearly a

00:25:58.220 --> 00:26:01.190
squarer is a memoryless
system.

00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:06.870
So in fact, we can indicate
here that this system is

00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:08.120
memoryless.

00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:15.980
Another important system is
what is referred to as an

00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:17.230
integrator.

00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:26.460
The output is equal to the
integral of the input.

00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:31.240
Here, as I've indicated it,
it's not just integrating

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:35.100
x(t), but it's integrating
the square of x(t).

00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:40.610
And whether we square before
we integrate or not, the

00:26:40.610 --> 00:26:46.060
essential point is that since
we're integrating the input,

00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:50.800
the value of the output at any
time is an accumulation of

00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:52.900
past history of the input.

00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:55.690
Well, an accumulation
of past history in

00:26:55.690 --> 00:26:57.580
essence implies memory.

00:26:57.580 --> 00:27:04.580
To get the output at a given
time requires the input over

00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:08.330
an interval, specifically for
longer than that time.

00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:12.340
So this system, in fact,
is not memoryless.

00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:21.970
And now, I have a third
system defined here.

00:27:21.970 --> 00:27:26.530
The third system is a system,
a discrete-time system, in

00:27:26.530 --> 00:27:34.210
which the output is equal to
the input but not quite.

00:27:34.210 --> 00:27:36.190
The output at some time--
let's say for

00:27:36.190 --> 00:27:38.690
example at n = 0--

00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:44.260
is equal to the input at one
time sample, or instant, or

00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:47.260
value of the index
before that.

00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:52.930
And so this, in fact, is a
system for which the output is

00:27:52.930 --> 00:27:57.930
simply the input delayed or
shifted by one sample.

00:27:57.930 --> 00:28:05.610
So this system is referred
to as a unit delay.

00:28:05.610 --> 00:28:10.190
And now, the question is, is
that system memoryless?

00:28:12.830 --> 00:28:16.530
Well, the output depends
only on the input--

00:28:16.530 --> 00:28:20.530
the output at any instant
depends only on the input at

00:28:20.530 --> 00:28:22.130
one instant.

00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:27.960
But since it depends on an
instant prior to the time at

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:30.040
which we're looking, or
different than the time at

00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:33.310
which we're looking, it violates
the definition of

00:28:33.310 --> 00:28:35.950
memoryless that we introduced.

00:28:35.950 --> 00:28:40.350
And so, in fact, the unit delay
is a system that has

00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:43.990
memory, and so let's
indicate that here.

00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:50.120
So this is not a memoryless
system because of the fact

00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:52.540
that there is 1 unit of delay.

00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:54.800
And in essence, delay
requires memory.

00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:04.500
OK, so that's the issue of
memory and memoryless systems.

00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:10.080
Let's now turn to another
property which a system may or

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:14.155
may not have, the property
referred to as invertibility.

00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:21.330
Now, essentially what
invertibility means is that

00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:25.120
given the output of the system,
you can figure out

00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:27.140
uniquely what the input was.

00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:30.740
That's one definition
for invertibility.

00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:34.640
Said another way, invertibility
means that given

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:37.100
the output, there's only
one input that

00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:38.180
could have caused it.

00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:43.180
That's another common definition
for invertibility.

00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:46.700
Another way of looking at it is,
in fact, to look at it in

00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:50.275
the context of a cascade
of systems.

00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:55.810
So let's consider a system.

00:29:55.810 --> 00:30:03.490
And here is a system which I
refer to as system A. And this

00:30:03.490 --> 00:30:06.260
could be continuous-time
or discrete-time.

00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:11.270
It has an input, x_1(t) or
x_1[n], depending on whether

00:30:11.270 --> 00:30:13.200
it's continuous-time or
discrete-time that we're

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:18.760
talking about, and an
associated output.

00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:24.970
And here, we have system
B with its

00:30:24.970 --> 00:30:29.510
associated input and output.

00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:34.490
And now, let's put these
two systems in cascade.

00:30:34.490 --> 00:30:40.040
So we'll take the output of
system 1 and feed it into the

00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:43.280
input of system 2--

00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:48.590
or system B. So the output of
system A goes into the input

00:30:48.590 --> 00:30:56.625
of system B. And if system A is
invertible and system B is

00:30:56.625 --> 00:31:04.030
its inverse, then the
consequence is that the output

00:31:04.030 --> 00:31:10.730
of system B is equal to
the input of system A.

00:31:10.730 --> 00:31:15.560
Now, I know there are a lot
of inputs and outputs and

00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:17.080
inverses in there.

00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:22.050
But essentially, what we mean by
what I've just said is that

00:31:22.050 --> 00:31:30.160
if we have system A and it's
invertible, and if we cascade

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:37.650
it with its inverse, system B,
then the overall cascade of

00:31:37.650 --> 00:31:43.710
these two systems is simply
what's referred to as the

00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:45.110
identity system.

00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:52.280
And the identity system is
simply a system which if you

00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:56.280
put a signal into it, you get
the same signal out of it.

00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:59.200
In other words, the overall
system is no

00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:00.830
transformation at all.

00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:07.330
And clearly, of course, for
a system to be able to be

00:32:07.330 --> 00:32:11.400
cascaded with another system
to generate the identity

00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:15.920
system requires that the first
system, system A, be

00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:18.250
invertible.

00:32:18.250 --> 00:32:23.730
So let's look at
some examples.

00:32:23.730 --> 00:32:30.090
If we had system A as I've
indicated here, where now the

00:32:30.090 --> 00:32:36.980
output is the running integral
of the input--

00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:39.420
and remember that we saw the
running integral when we

00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:42.990
talked about the relationship
between steps and impulses--

00:32:42.990 --> 00:32:45.970
if this happened to be
an impulse, then the

00:32:45.970 --> 00:32:48.640
output would be a step.

00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:54.790
This system is referred to, of
course, as an integrator since

00:32:54.790 --> 00:33:01.180
the output is the running
integral of the input.

00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:09.570
And the integrator, in fact,
is an invertible system.

00:33:09.570 --> 00:33:14.450
And its inverse is a system for
which the output is the

00:33:14.450 --> 00:33:16.350
derivative of the input.

00:33:16.350 --> 00:33:22.700
So the inverse of system A, if
system A is an integrator, is

00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:27.970
a system for which the output is
equal to the derivative of

00:33:27.970 --> 00:33:32.360
the input which, not
surprisingly, is referred to

00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:35.515
as a differentiator.

00:33:40.870 --> 00:33:46.690
So an integrator
is invertible.

00:33:46.690 --> 00:33:50.270
Its inverse is a
differentiator.

00:33:50.270 --> 00:33:52.810
What you might want to think
about is the question of

00:33:52.810 --> 00:33:56.550
whether a differentiator
is invertible.

00:33:56.550 --> 00:34:00.130
Now, to answer that, what you
would ask yourself is, if you

00:34:00.130 --> 00:34:02.390
always knew what the derivative
of the signal is,

00:34:02.390 --> 00:34:06.410
would you necessarily know
what the signal was?

00:34:06.410 --> 00:34:10.090
In other words, if you have a
differentiator and you have

00:34:10.090 --> 00:34:12.060
the output of the
differentiator, could you

00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:14.550
always figure out what
the input was?

00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:17.429
If you could, the system
would be invertible.

00:34:17.429 --> 00:34:21.639
If you couldn't, the system
would not be invertible.

00:34:21.639 --> 00:34:24.060
So you might just want
to think about that.

00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:26.630
I guess I won't tell
you right now.

00:34:26.630 --> 00:34:32.260
But I'm sure that you'll think
about that more, particularly

00:34:32.260 --> 00:34:36.760
with the guidance of
the video manual.

00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:41.639
OK, well let's look at
one last system.

00:34:41.639 --> 00:34:48.000
I've indicated here a system
for which the output is

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.620
related to the input
through this curve.

00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:56.800
And what I mean by this curve,
which wasn't done quite as

00:34:56.800 --> 00:35:04.210
well as I might have, is that
the output is equal to the

00:35:04.210 --> 00:35:06.530
square of the input.

00:35:06.530 --> 00:35:13.070
So this system is our squarer
as we talked about before.

00:35:13.070 --> 00:35:17.510
We saw previously, or discussed
the fact previously,

00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:22.315
that the squarer is a
memoryless system.

00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:30.440
And now the question is, is a
squarer an invertible system?

00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:35.020
Well, the question then is, if
you're given the square of a

00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:37.990
signal, can you figure out
what the signal is?

00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:42.800
And as I'm sure you've already
suspected, the answer to that

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:47.030
is no, because obviously if
the signal was negative or

00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:49.540
positive, you wouldn't be able
to figure that out after

00:35:49.540 --> 00:35:50.820
you've squared.

00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:55.085
So in fact, the squarer
is not invertible.

00:35:57.670 --> 00:36:00.650
All right, so we've introduced
several properties.

00:36:00.650 --> 00:36:04.260
And by the way, as we've gone
through it, also introduced

00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:07.190
some systems that will
turn out to be useful

00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:09.100
and important systems.

00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:13.930
And now, let's continue with
some other properties.

00:36:13.930 --> 00:36:18.720
A property that we'll find
useful to make reference to,

00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:21.610
from time to time, and will,
in fact, play a fairly

00:36:21.610 --> 00:36:26.130
important role in a variety of
discussions during the course,

00:36:26.130 --> 00:36:30.830
is a property which is referred
to as causality.

00:36:30.830 --> 00:36:36.410
Now, in essence what causality
means is the following.

00:36:36.410 --> 00:36:41.930
A system is set to be causal if,
as one way of saying it,

00:36:41.930 --> 00:36:45.340
it only responds when
you kick it.

00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:49.450
Is another way of saying it, its
response at any time only

00:36:49.450 --> 00:36:54.020
depends on values of the input
prior to that time.

00:36:54.020 --> 00:36:58.110
So a causal system, both
continuous time and discrete

00:36:58.110 --> 00:37:04.320
time, is defined sometimes
as a system which has the

00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:10.470
property that the output at any
time depends only on the

00:37:10.470 --> 00:37:15.520
input prior or equal
to that time.

00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:19.220
Essentially what we're saying
is that the system can't

00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:22.550
anticipate future inputs.

00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:27.450
And so that, in fact, is another
possible definition

00:37:27.450 --> 00:37:32.930
for causality, that the system
is causal if it can't

00:37:32.930 --> 00:37:36.490
anticipate future inputs.

00:37:36.490 --> 00:37:39.110
Finally, an alternative
way of saying it

00:37:39.110 --> 00:37:42.630
mathematically is as follows.

00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:50.920
If I have two signals, x_1(t)
and x_2(t), with their

00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:58.070
associated outputs, y_1(t) and
y_2(t), then a system is said

00:37:58.070 --> 00:38:03.870
to be causal if and only if it
has the property that if those

00:38:03.870 --> 00:38:08.520
two inputs are identical up
until some time, then the

00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:12.300
outputs are identical up
until the same time.

00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:18.060
So if we have two signals that
are exactly the same up until

00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:22.050
some time and perhaps do
something different later on,

00:38:22.050 --> 00:38:26.980
causality requires that the
outputs not anticipate the

00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:31.150
fact that those inputs are at
some future time going to do

00:38:31.150 --> 00:38:32.330
something different.

00:38:32.330 --> 00:38:36.140
And that, in fact, is the most
useful mathematical definition

00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:37.620
of causality.

00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:43.830
And of course, I've written that
here for continuous time.

00:38:43.830 --> 00:38:52.050
And the same definition of
causality also applies for

00:38:52.050 --> 00:38:53.300
discrete time.

00:38:55.520 --> 00:39:00.560
OK, well let's look
at an example.

00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:06.290
Let's take an example which
is a system which is the

00:39:06.290 --> 00:39:09.380
following discrete-time
system.

00:39:09.380 --> 00:39:17.980
The output at any given time
is the sum of x[n], x[n]

00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:20.270
delayed, and x[n]

00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:22.800
anticipated.

00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:27.570
And this is, in fact, a system
that's very useful and

00:39:27.570 --> 00:39:30.735
referred to as a
moving average.

00:39:34.210 --> 00:39:41.720
And so if we think of a moving
average, if we have here a

00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:44.510
sequence, x[n]

00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:45.880
and x[n]

00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:53.770
with other values going off in
both directions, for any

00:39:53.770 --> 00:39:57.680
value, n_0, at which we're
computing the output--

00:39:57.680 --> 00:40:01.050
and this is y[n], the output--

00:40:01.050 --> 00:40:10.040
we take x[n 0], x[n 0-1],
and x[n 0+1].

00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:14.590
And so to form that moving
average, we would take these

00:40:14.590 --> 00:40:19.580
three values and combine them
together, adding them and then

00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:23.540
dividing by 3 to get that.

00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:27.100
Well, is the system causal?

00:40:27.100 --> 00:40:31.360
One way to answer that is to
determine whether the output

00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:34.890
at any given time depends on
future values of the input.

00:40:34.890 --> 00:40:38.370
And clearly, if you look at
this, what you see is that the

00:40:38.370 --> 00:40:43.940
output at time n_0 depends both
on past values and on

00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:46.290
future values.

00:40:46.290 --> 00:40:50.890
As opposed to another moving
average, which I've indicated

00:40:50.890 --> 00:40:55.100
here, where I simply
shifted the values

00:40:55.100 --> 00:40:57.210
that I combined together.

00:40:57.210 --> 00:41:01.490
And in this case, because of the
way in which I picked the

00:41:01.490 --> 00:41:09.270
values, the output depends on
the value at n_0, the value at

00:41:09.270 --> 00:41:14.380
n_0 - 1, and the value
at n_0 - 2.

00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:16.160
So y[n 0]

00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:23.430
would depend here on x[n 0],
x[n 0-1], and x[n 0-2].

00:41:23.430 --> 00:41:31.210
And so in this case, the
system is not causal.

00:41:31.210 --> 00:41:36.660
And in this case, the
system is causal.

00:41:39.250 --> 00:41:42.900
All right, now let's turn to
another system property, the

00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:45.975
property referred
to as stability.

00:41:48.650 --> 00:41:53.730
Now, there are lots of
definitions of stability, and

00:41:53.730 --> 00:41:57.720
some of them get very
mathematical and formal.

00:41:57.720 --> 00:42:01.180
But we've chosen, and what we'll
use as our definition of

00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:04.100
stability, is what's called
bounded-input

00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:07.000
bounded-output stability.

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:11.610
And essentially, the definition
is that a system is

00:42:11.610 --> 00:42:16.880
stable if and only if for
every bounded input, the

00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:18.650
output is bounded.

00:42:18.650 --> 00:42:23.180
So the notion is if you have a
system and the input never

00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:29.520
gets above some finite value,
then stability requires that

00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:33.600
the output also stay within
some bounded values.

00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:36.150
And I'm sure that stability
and instability are things

00:42:36.150 --> 00:42:40.030
that you're kind of informally
familiar with.

00:42:40.030 --> 00:42:45.840
Let me just emphasize the point
with something that I

00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:50.410
borrowed actually from
my son with some

00:42:50.410 --> 00:42:53.360
reluctance on his part.

00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:57.170
If we, for example, take a
system like this, which is in

00:42:57.170 --> 00:43:01.140
essence a pendulum, this system
as I'm holding it here

00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:05.040
is stable because if I put in
a bounded input, which is a

00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:09.170
displacement, the output, which
is the movement of it,

00:43:09.170 --> 00:43:11.680
remains bounded.

00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:15.510
Now on the other hand, if I
put the system like this,

00:43:15.510 --> 00:43:18.200
which is, in fact, what's
referred to as an inverted

00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:22.990
pendulum, although we could
conceivably get this to

00:43:22.990 --> 00:43:27.550
balance, just a slight
displacement because of the

00:43:27.550 --> 00:43:30.050
fact that the pendulum
is inverted, a slight

00:43:30.050 --> 00:43:35.130
displacement and the output
becomes unbounded.

00:43:35.130 --> 00:43:37.630
Now, an interesting thing with
the inverted pendulum, by the

00:43:37.630 --> 00:43:42.560
way, which I'm sure all of you,
if you were anything like

00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:46.150
me, were intrigued with as a
kid, was the notion that you

00:43:46.150 --> 00:43:50.920
could take an inverted pendulum
and in effect turn it

00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:55.360
back into a stable system by
using what I'm doing right

00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:58.730
now, which is feedback.

00:43:58.730 --> 00:44:03.200
What I've done in that case is
I've stabilized the system by

00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:06.390
using feedback, visual
feedback, from

00:44:06.390 --> 00:44:08.830
my eye to my hand.

00:44:08.830 --> 00:44:11.070
And in fact, one of the very
important things that we'll

00:44:11.070 --> 00:44:13.850
see about feedback when we talk
about feedback systems

00:44:13.850 --> 00:44:16.670
much later in the course is
that one of their very

00:44:16.670 --> 00:44:22.330
important applications is in
stabilizing unstable systems.

00:44:22.330 --> 00:44:25.960
By the way, one of their
problems is that if not used

00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:30.370
correctly, it can destabilize
stable systems.

00:44:30.370 --> 00:44:32.720
OK, well let's continue on with

00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:36.160
our property of stability.

00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:40.950
I have here, again, the example
of an integrator.

00:44:40.950 --> 00:44:46.380
And as I indicate here, if we
have an integrator and we put

00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:50.900
a step function into it or a
step signal into it, the

00:44:50.900 --> 00:44:55.330
output is what's referred
to as a ramp signal.

00:44:55.330 --> 00:44:58.240
It linearly increases.

00:44:58.240 --> 00:45:01.860
Now, the question is,
is a ramp unbounded?

00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:03.680
The input is bounded.

00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:05.580
The step input is bounded.

00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:10.590
The ramp is unbounded because
if you try to establish any

00:45:10.590 --> 00:45:15.820
bound on it, you can always go
out far enough in time so that

00:45:15.820 --> 00:45:18.430
the output will exceed
that bound.

00:45:18.430 --> 00:45:24.320
So in fact, the integrator
is not stable.

00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:34.960
OK, now finally, I'd like to
turn to two properties that

00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:39.180
we'll make considerable use of
as the course goes on, the

00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:42.630
properties of time invariance
and linearity.

00:45:45.210 --> 00:45:52.630
Time invariance, in essence,
says that the system doesn't

00:45:52.630 --> 00:45:56.360
really care what you
call the origin.

00:45:56.360 --> 00:46:00.430
In other words, it says if you
take the input and you shift

00:46:00.430 --> 00:46:04.370
it in time, all that you've done
is taken the output and

00:46:04.370 --> 00:46:07.630
shifted it in time by
the same amount.

00:46:07.630 --> 00:46:12.680
Somewhat more formally as I've
indicated here, if in

00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:16.270
continuous time we have an
input, x(t), which generate an

00:46:16.270 --> 00:46:22.990
output, y(t), then time
invariance requires that if

00:46:22.990 --> 00:46:26.820
the input is shifted by any
amount of time, the output is

00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:29.610
shifted by the same
amount of time.

00:46:29.610 --> 00:46:33.560
And exactly the same applies
in discrete time.

00:46:36.370 --> 00:46:41.340
For example, if we have a system
which is a system I've

00:46:41.340 --> 00:46:45.170
shown here, which by the way is
the system that we talked

00:46:45.170 --> 00:46:48.930
about previously to go from
a step sequence--

00:46:48.930 --> 00:46:51.940
I'm sorry, from an impulse
sequence to a step sequence.

00:46:51.940 --> 00:46:53.880
We called it a running sum.

00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:57.890
And actually, what it's also
often called is an

00:46:57.890 --> 00:46:59.450
accumulator.

00:46:59.450 --> 00:47:04.580
What it does is accumulate
past values of the input.

00:47:04.580 --> 00:47:10.590
Well, is the accumulator
time-invariant?

00:47:10.590 --> 00:47:13.080
The best way to establish that
is to work through the

00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:17.880
equations and verify that it
either does or doesn't satisfy

00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:20.920
the formal definition
of time invariance.

00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:26.130
Informally, if you think about
it, it makes intuitive sense

00:47:26.130 --> 00:47:30.640
that the accumulator is
time-invariant because if

00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:35.620
you're accumulating values and
if you delay the values that

00:47:35.620 --> 00:47:40.010
you're putting into the
accumulator, then the

00:47:40.010 --> 00:47:42.880
associated values that come
out will be delayed by the

00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:43.550
same amount.

00:47:43.550 --> 00:47:47.930
The accumulator doesn't care
really if you shift the input.

00:47:47.930 --> 00:47:51.730
It'll just simply shift
the associated output.

00:47:51.730 --> 00:47:55.630
But more generally, if you're
trying to test time

00:47:55.630 --> 00:47:58.940
invariance, it's important to
return to the definition.

00:47:58.940 --> 00:48:01.690
And that's what you're required
to do in the examples

00:48:01.690 --> 00:48:06.140
in the video manual.

00:48:06.140 --> 00:48:10.700
OK, well, I indicate
another example.

00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:14.130
We had the example of
an accumulator.

00:48:14.130 --> 00:48:20.430
Here's another example which, in
fact, as we'll see later is

00:48:20.430 --> 00:48:23.500
a system which is a modulator.

00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:26.820
The output is the input,
modulated.

00:48:26.820 --> 00:48:32.840
And although you might think at
first that this system is

00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:40.330
time invariant, in fact it is
not, because the input shifted

00:48:40.330 --> 00:48:46.240
generates an output which is
the input shifted times the

00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:49.180
same modulation function.

00:48:49.180 --> 00:48:55.170
Whereas if we were to take the
output of the system, we have

00:48:55.170 --> 00:49:03.220
x(t) is the input, then what
that would correspond to is

00:49:03.220 --> 00:49:10.220
sin(t-t_0) * x(t-t_0).

00:49:10.220 --> 00:49:13.770
And since these two are
not equal, this

00:49:13.770 --> 00:49:18.190
system is not time invariant.

00:49:18.190 --> 00:49:22.000
And this is an example that
often causes a slight amount

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:27.030
of difficulty because it seems
like when you look

00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:29.180
at it ought to be.

00:49:29.180 --> 00:49:33.480
And so I strongly encourage you,
in the context of working

00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:37.860
problems in the manual, that you
think very carefully about

00:49:37.860 --> 00:49:42.030
this and at least believe
that what I told you

00:49:42.030 --> 00:49:44.690
is the right answer.

00:49:44.690 --> 00:49:48.500
OK, now the final property that
I want to introduce today

00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:52.580
is the property of linearity.

00:49:52.580 --> 00:49:58.290
And linearity is defined in a
manner similar for continuous

00:49:58.290 --> 00:50:00.790
time and discrete time.

00:50:00.790 --> 00:50:07.090
And what it says is that if
we have some inputs with

00:50:07.090 --> 00:50:13.300
associated outputs, let's say
x_1(t) and x_2(t), then a

00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:19.930
system is linear if it has the
property that the output to a

00:50:19.930 --> 00:50:24.000
linear combination of those
inputs is the same linear

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:27.250
combination of the associated
outputs.

00:50:27.250 --> 00:50:32.650
And so that's what I've
indicated here, that if we now

00:50:32.650 --> 00:50:36.290
put into the system a linear
combination of those inputs,

00:50:36.290 --> 00:50:40.610
then for linearity, we require
that the output is the same

00:50:40.610 --> 00:50:42.320
linear combination.

00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:47.110
And exactly the same applies
in discrete time.

00:50:47.110 --> 00:50:50.960
And you can show from this
definition that if a system is

00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:54.930
linear with two inputs, then
it's linear in terms of an

00:50:54.930 --> 00:50:58.330
arbitrary number of inputs.

00:50:58.330 --> 00:51:01.280
I have a number of examples.

00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:07.410
And these are examples that,
again, I ask you to think

00:51:07.410 --> 00:51:11.250
about as you look at
the video manual.

00:51:11.250 --> 00:51:12.940
Just to suggest the answer--

00:51:12.940 --> 00:51:16.420
well, not to suggest but to
tell you the answer, the

00:51:16.420 --> 00:51:19.400
integrator as we have
here is linear.

00:51:23.550 --> 00:51:26.890
This system in which the output
is double the input

00:51:26.890 --> 00:51:30.570
plus a constant, you would
kind of think it's linear

00:51:30.570 --> 00:51:33.030
because it's a straight line.

00:51:33.030 --> 00:51:35.780
But one has to be careful.

00:51:35.780 --> 00:51:40.630
And in fact, as it turns out,
this is not linear.

00:51:40.630 --> 00:51:43.950
There is a qualifier attached
to it because it has a

00:51:43.950 --> 00:51:47.470
property referred to as
incrementally linear, which is

00:51:47.470 --> 00:51:51.590
discussed somewhat
more in the text.

00:51:51.590 --> 00:51:57.340
And finally, we have a system
which is the squarer that I've

00:51:57.340 --> 00:51:59.980
indicated again here.

00:51:59.980 --> 00:52:03.830
And squaring it is definitely
not a linear operation.

00:52:07.080 --> 00:52:12.200
OK, so what we've done, then,
is to introduce a number of

00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:15.570
properties of systems.

00:52:15.570 --> 00:52:19.370
And we've also, by the way, as
I've stressed previously, as

00:52:19.370 --> 00:52:23.090
we've gone along introduced also
a number of important and

00:52:23.090 --> 00:52:25.730
useful systems, like the
accumulator, the integrator,

00:52:25.730 --> 00:52:29.550
the differentiator, et cetera.

00:52:29.550 --> 00:52:33.110
What we'll see is that the
properties of linearity and

00:52:33.110 --> 00:52:38.640
time invariance in particular
become central and important

00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:40.260
properties.

00:52:40.260 --> 00:52:45.930
And in the next lecture, what
we'll show is that with

00:52:45.930 --> 00:52:51.890
systems that are linear and
time-invariant, the use of the

00:52:51.890 --> 00:52:55.310
impulse function, both in
continuous time and discrete

00:52:55.310 --> 00:53:00.150
time, provides an
extraordinarily important and

00:53:00.150 --> 00:53:04.300
useful mechanism for
characterizing those systems.

00:53:04.300 --> 00:53:05.550
Thank you.
