00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.510
PROFESSOR: In the last several
lectures, we've talked about a

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.930
generalization of the
continuous-time Fourier

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.490
transform and a very similar
strategy also applies to

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.610
discrete-time, and that's what
we want to begin to deal with

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.750
in today's lecture.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.400
So what we want to talk about
is generalizing the Fourier

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.650
transform, and what this will
lead to in discrete-time is a

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.380
notion referred to as
the z-transform.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.810
Now, just as in continuous-time,
in

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.670
discrete-time the Fourier
transform corresponded to a

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.830
representation of a sequence
as a linear combination of

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.750
complex exponentials.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.430
So this was the synthesis
equation.

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:46.810
And, of course, there is the

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.100
corresponding analysis equation.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.310
And as you recall, and as is the
same for continuous-time,

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.300
the reason that we picked
complex exponentials was

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.900
because of the fact that they
are eigenfunctions of linear

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.730
time-invariant systems.

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:09.229
In other words, if you have a
complex exponential into a

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.560
linear time-invariant system,
the output is a complex

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.820
exponential.

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:19.620
And the change in complex
amplitude, which corresponds

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.150
to the frequency response, in
fact is what led to the

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.640
definition of the Fourier
transform.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.070
In particular, it is the Fourier
transform of the

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.610
impulse response.

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.450
Well, that set of notions is,
more or less, identical to the

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.410
way we motivated the Laplace
transform in the

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.030
continuous-time case, in the
Fourier transform in the

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.680
continuous-time case.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.710
And just as in continuous-time,
there are a

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:55.050
set of signals more general than
the complex exponentials,

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.760
which are also eigenfunctions
of linear

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.420
time-invariant systems.

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.810
In particular, in discrete-time,
if we had

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.790
instead of an exponential e to
the j omega n, we had a more

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:16.220
general complex number z, that
the signal z to the n is also

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.090
an eigenfunction of a linear
time-invariant system for any

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.630
particular z.

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.770
So we can see that by
substituting that into the

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.580
convolution sum and recognizing,
again, very

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.820
strongly paralleling the
continuous-time argument, that

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:42.670
we can rewrite this factor as
z to the n z to the minus k.

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:48.960
And because of the fact that
it's a sum on k and this term

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.460
doesn't depend on k, we can
take that term out.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:57.010
And the conclusion is that if
we have z to the n as an

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:04.640
input, that the output is of the
same form times a factor

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.980
which depends on z.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.630
But of course, doesn't depend
on k because that is summed

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.260
out as we form the summation.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:18.149
So, in fact, this summation
corresponds to a complex

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:26.490
number, which we'll denote as H
of z, where z will represent

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.750
a more general complex number.

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:34.870
Namely, z is r e to the j omega,
r being the magnitude

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.020
of this complex number
and omega, of

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.530
course, being the angle.

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:46.950
So for a linear time-invariant
system, a more general complex

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:51.900
exponential sequence of this
form generates as an output a

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.990
complex exponential sequence of
the same form with a change

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:00.480
in amplitude which we're
representing as H of z,

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.010
recognizing the fact that it's
going to be a function of what

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:06.080
that complex number is.

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:11.150
And this amplitude factor is
given by this summation.

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:18.130
And it is this summation which
is defined as the z-transform

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:22.100
of the sequence H of n.

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.240
Now, let me stress that--

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.650
and I'll continue to stress this
as the lecture goes on.

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:33.260
That much of what we've said is
directly parallel to what

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.790
we said in the continuous-time
case.

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:41.310
And what we've simply done
is to expand from complex

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:46.060
exponentials with a purely
imaginary exponent, complex

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:50.950
exponential time functions or
sequences of that form, to

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:56.990
ones that have more general
complex exponential factors.

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:03.830
Now, we have a mapping here from
the impulse response to

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:08.660
the amplitude or the eigenvalue
associated with

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:14.320
that input, and this mapping is
what is referred to as the

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.130
z-transform.

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:21.120
So H of z is, in fact,
the z-transform

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.060
of the impulse response.

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:27.010
And if we consider applying
this mapping as we did in

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:30.420
continuous-time in a similar
argument, applying this

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:35.490
mapping to a sequence whether
or not it corresponds to the

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:39.180
impulse response or a linear
time-invariant system, that

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:46.270
leads then to the z-transform of
a general sequence x of n.

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:51.410
The z-transform being defined
by this relationship.

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:56.460
And again, notationally, we'll
often represent a time

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:00.740
function and a z-transform
through a shorthand notation,

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:06.690
just indicating that x of z is
the z-transform of x of n.

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.750
So we've kind of motivated the
development in a manner

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:14.760
exactly identical to
what we had done

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:16.570
with the Laplace transform.

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:19.010
Kind of the idea that if you
look at the eigenvalue

00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:23.620
associated with a linear
time-invariant system, that

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:29.220
essentially generates a mapping
between the sequence--

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:33.750
system impulse response
and a function of z.

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:36.690
And that corresponds to the
z-transform here, it

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:39.020
corresponded to the Laplace
transform in the

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:41.760
continuous-time case.

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:46.850
That same argument is also the
kind of argument that we use

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:51.200
to lead us into the Fourier
transform originally.

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:57.400
And once again, what you would
expect is that the z-transform

00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:00.170
has a very close and important
relationship

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:01.810
to the Fourier transform.

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:06.730
And indeed, that relationship
turns out to be, more or less,

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:11.630
identical to the relationship
between the Laplace transform

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:15.400
and the Fourier transform
in continuous-time.

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.650
Well, let's look at
the relationship.

00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:23.240
First of all, what we recognize
is that if we

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:30.960
compare the Fourier transform
expression for a sequence and

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:36.299
the z-transform expression for
the same sequence that they

00:08:36.299 --> 00:08:39.750
involve, essentially,
the same operations.

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:47.230
And in fact, since z is of the
form r e to the j omega, if we

00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:52.300
want this sum to look like this
sum, then that would mean

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:56.900
that we would choose z equal
to e to the j omega.

00:08:56.900 --> 00:09:01.740
Said another way, the
z-transform, when z is e to

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:04.990
the j omega, is going to reduce

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:07.900
to the Fourier transform.

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:12.290
So we have a relationship like
the one, again, that we had

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:15.140
between the Laplace transform
and the Fourier transform in

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:16.710
continuous-time.

00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:22.020
Namely that for a certain set
of values of the complex

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:26.220
variable, the transform, the
z-transform, reduces to the

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:28.470
Fourier transform.

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:32.970
So if we have x of z, the
z-transform, and we look at

00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:40.100
that for z equal to e to the j
omega, and z equal to e to the

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:43.850
j omega is similar to saying
that we're looking at that for

00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:46.840
the magnitude of z equal to 1.

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:49.740
We're specifically choosing
r equal to 1, which is the

00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:52.050
magnitude of z.

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:54.550
Then this is equal
to the Fourier

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:57.290
transform of the sequence.

00:09:57.290 --> 00:10:02.580
So the z-transform for z equal
to e to the j omega is the

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:07.020
Fourier transform,
and so this then

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:11.290
corresponds to x of omega.

00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:12.540
Namely, the Fourier transform.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.510
Well, we now have ourselves in a
similar situation, again, to

00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:22.840
what we had when we talked about
the Laplace transform.

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:28.050
Namely, a notational
awkwardness, or inconvenience,

00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:30.510
which we can resolve by simply

00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:33.840
redefining some of our notation.

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:36.960
In particular, the awkwardness
relates to the fact that

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:40.990
whereas we've been writing our
Fourier transforms this way,

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:46.620
as x of omega, if we were to
express x of z and look at it,

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:48.510
it's equal to e to
the j omega.

00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:52.320
We end up with the independent
variable being e to the j

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:56.240
omega rather than omega.

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:58.920
Well, in fact, the Fourier
transform is

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:00.020
a function of omega.

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:02.620
It's also a function of
e to the j omega.

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:06.620
And now what we can see is that
given the fact that we

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:12.310
want to generalize the Fourier
transform to the z-transform,

00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:17.870
it's convenient now to use as
notation for the Fourier

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:22.120
transform x of z with z equal
to e to the j omega.

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:25.030
Namely, our Fourier transforms
will now be written as I've

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:26.640
indicated here.

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:31.970
So just summarizing that, our
new notation is that the

00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:37.980
independent variable on the
Fourier transform is now going

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:42.480
to be expressed as e to the j
omega rather than as omega.

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:47.320
It's a minor notational change,
but I recognize the

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:51.630
fact that it's somewhat
confusing initially, and takes

00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:55.200
a few minutes to sit down and
just get it straightened out.

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:56.580
It's very similar
to what we did

00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:58.440
with the Laplace transform.

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:02.560
But let me draw your attention
to the fact that in the

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:06.090
Laplace transform, the
independent variable that we

00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:11.520
ended up with in talking about
the Fourier transform is

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:14.640
different than what we're
ending up with here.

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:18.160
In particular, before we
had j omega, now we

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:21.430
have e to the j omega.

00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:27.350
And the reason for that is
simply that whereas in

00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:29.530
continuous time we were talking
about functions of the

00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:34.530
form e to the st, now we're
talking about sequences of the

00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:38.100
form z to the n.

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:41.940
So we have one relationship
between the Fourier transform

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:43.060
and the z-transform.

00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:47.330
Namely, the fact that for the
magnitude of z equal to 1, the

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:53.390
z-transform reduces to the
Fourier transform.

00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:56.690
Now, in the Laplace transform,
we also had another important

00:12:56.690 --> 00:13:03.250
relationship and observation,
which was the fact that the

00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:07.100
Laplace transform
was the Fourier

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:11.870
transform of x of t modified.

00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:12.970
And how was it modified?

00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:18.270
It was modified by multiplying
by a decaying or growing

00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:21.210
exponential, depending on what
the real part of s is.

00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:23.820
Well, we have a very similar
situation with the

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:25.430
z-transform.

00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:31.560
In particular, in addition to
the fact that the z-transform

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:34.910
for z equal to e to the j omega
reduces to the Fourier

00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:39.670
transform, we'll see that the
z-transform for other values

00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:45.330
of z is the Fourier transform
of the sequence with an

00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:46.800
exponential weighting.

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:50.180
And let's see where
that comes from.

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:53.620
Here we have the general
expression for the

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:55.230
z-transform.

00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:59.680
And recognizing that z is a
complex number which we're

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:05.440
expressing in polar form as r e
to the j omega, substituting

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:10.400
that in, this summation now
becomes x of n, r e to the j

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:12.240
omega to the minus n.

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:17.355
We can factor out these two
terms, r to the minus n and e

00:14:17.355 --> 00:14:19.670
to the minus j omega n.

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:26.060
And combining the r to the minus
n with x of n and the e

00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:30.130
to the minus j omega n being
treated separately, what we

00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:35.530
end up with is the summation
that I have here.

00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:39.840
Well, what this says is that
the z-transform, which is

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:46.430
this, at z equal to r e to the
j omega, is in fact the

00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:53.200
Fourier transform of what?

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:58.670
It's the Fourier transform
of x of n multiplied by r

00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:00.610
to the minus n.

00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:06.200
So that is the expression
that we have here.

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:10.150
And in continuous-time, we had
the Laplace transform as the

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:15.710
Fourier transform of x of t
e to the minus sigma t.

00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:18.820
Here we have the Fourier
transform of x of n r

00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:21.790
to the minus n.

00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:25.095
Now, something to just reflect
on for a minute is--

00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:31.980
because it tends to cause a
little bit of problem with the

00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:35.640
algebra later on if you're
attention isn't drawn to it,

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:39.670
is that we're talking about
multiplying x of n times r to

00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:41.410
the minus n.

00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:50.120
The question is, for r greater
than 1, does r to the minus n

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:55.220
increase exponentially as n
increases or does it decrease?

00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:57.670
We're talking about
r to the minus n.

00:15:57.670 --> 00:16:00.860
If r is greater than 1, if
the magnitude of r is

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:01.370
greater than 1.

00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:04.760
For example, if it's equal
to 2, r to the minus n

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:06.800
is 1/2 to the n.

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:10.440
And so, in fact, that decreases
exponentially.

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:14.900
Or more generally, the larger
r is, the faster r to the

00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:17.930
minus n decays with
increasing n.

00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:28.490
Well, let's just look at some
examples of the z-transform.

00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:33.930
And examples that I've picked,
again, are examples directly

00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:34.820
out of the text.

00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:40.900
And so the details of the
algebra you can look at more

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:44.280
leisurely as you sit
with the textbook.

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:48.200
Let's consider, first of all, an
exponential sequence x of n

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:50.960
equals a to the n times
the unit step.

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:56.460
So 0 for negative time and an
exponential for positive time.

00:16:56.460 --> 00:17:00.060
And the Fourier transform,
as we've seen in earlier

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:05.210
lectures, is 1 over 1 minus
a e to the minus j omega.

00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:08.540
But this doesn't always
converge.

00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:12.210
In particular, for convergence
of the Fourier transform, we

00:17:12.210 --> 00:17:14.810
would require absolute
summability of

00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:16.770
the original sequence.

00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:20.319
And that, in turn, requires
that the magnitude of a be

00:17:20.319 --> 00:17:22.250
less than 1.

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:25.730
So the Fourier transform is
this, provided that the

00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:28.140
magnitude of a is less than 1.

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:31.530
And what is the Fourier
transform if the magnitude of

00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:34.330
a is not less than 1?

00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:36.380
Well, the answer is
that, in that

00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:37.630
case, it doesn't converge.

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:42.740
Now, let's look at
the z-transform.

00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:47.770
The z-transform is the sum from
minus infinity to plus

00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:54.420
infinity of a to the
n z to the minus n

00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:56.480
times the unit step.

00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:59.130
The unit step will change
the lower limit to 0.

00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:01.460
So it's the sum from
0 to infinity.

00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:08.720
And this is of the form
a times z to the

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:11.490
minus 1 to the n.

00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:14.740
So we're summing from 0 to
infinity a times z to the

00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:16.360
minus 1 to the n.

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:22.320
That sum is 1 over 1 minus
a z to the minus 1.

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:29.000
But in order for that sum to
converge, we require that the

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:35.710
magnitude of a times z to the
minus 1 be less than 1.

00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:43.320
Now, the z-transform is the
Fourier transform of the

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:48.090
sequence a to the n times
r to the minus n.

00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:55.530
And this statement about the
z-transform converging is

00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:58.710
exactly identical to the
statement that what we're

00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:04.280
requiring is that the magnitude
of a times r to the

00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:11.350
minus 1 be less than 1, where
this represents the

00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:17.440
exponential factor that we have
that in effect is applied

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:21.800
to the sequence, so that the
Fourier transform becomes the

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:23.430
z-transform.

00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:27.560
And so, if we put this
condition, we can interpret

00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:32.100
this condition in exactly the
same way that we interpret the

00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:36.920
condition on convergence of
the Fourier transform.

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:44.230
So from what we've worked out
here then, what we have is the

00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:50.160
z-transform of a to the n times
u of n is 1 over 1 minus

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:53.600
a z to the minus 1.

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:58.940
That works for any value of a
provided that we pick the

00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:01.550
value of z correctly.

00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:05.120
In particular, we have to
pick the set of values

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:07.900
of z, so that what?

00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:11.870
So that the magnitude of a
times z to the minus 1

00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:13.590
is less than 1.

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:17.640
Or equivalently, so that the
magnitude of z is greater than

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:20.040
the magnitude of a.

00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:25.260
So associated with the
z-transform of this sequence

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:29.890
is this algebraic expression,
and this set of values on z

00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:32.820
for which that algebraic
expression is valid.

00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:38.600
And just as with the Laplace
transform, this range of

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:44.430
values is referred to as the
region of convergence of the

00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:45.680
z-transform.

00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:52.950
Now, again, as we saw with the
Laplace transform, it's

00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:58.590
important to recognize that in
specifying or having worked

00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:02.870
out the z-transform of a
sequence, it's not just the

00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:07.160
algebraic expression, but also
the region of convergence

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:11.700
that's required to uniquely
specify it.

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:15.420
To emphasize that further,
here is Example

00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:17.500
10.2 from the text.

00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:20.910
And if you work that one
through, what you find is

00:21:20.910 --> 00:21:26.190
that, algebraically, the
z-transform of this sequence

00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:30.770
is 1 over 1 minus a
z to the minus 1.

00:21:30.770 --> 00:21:34.240
Identical algebraically to
what we had up here.

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:42.360
But now with a region of
convergence, which is the

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:45.640
magnitude of z less than
the magnitude of a.

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:49.470
In contrast to this example,
where the region of

00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:53.040
convergence was the magnitude
of z greater than the

00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:56.160
magnitude of a.

00:21:56.160 --> 00:22:01.170
So again, it requires not just
the algebraic expression, but

00:22:01.170 --> 00:22:06.230
also requires a specification of
the region of convergence.

00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:12.380
And also, as with the Laplace
transform, it's convenient in

00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:19.870
looking at the z-transform
to represent it

00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:22.330
in the complex plane.

00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:25.710
In this case, the complex
plane referred to as the

00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:28.790
z-plane, whereas in
continuous-time when we talked

00:22:28.790 --> 00:22:31.400
about the Laplace transform,
it was the s-plane.

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:34.660
z, of course, because z is the
complex variable in terms of

00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:37.910
which we're representing
the z-transform.

00:22:37.910 --> 00:22:44.090
So we will be representing the
z-transform in terms of

00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:48.400
representations in the complex
plane, real part

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:50.530
and imaginary part.

00:22:50.530 --> 00:22:54.630
But I've also identified
a circle here.

00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:56.830
And you could wonder,
well, what's the

00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:59.750
significance of the circle?

00:22:59.750 --> 00:23:05.710
Recall that in the discussion
that we just came from, when

00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:09.380
we talked about the relationship
between the

00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:13.460
z-transform and the Fourier
transform, the z-transform

00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:16.290
reduces to the Fourier transform
when the magnitude

00:23:16.290 --> 00:23:19.620
of z is equal to 1.

00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:21.420
The magnitude of z
equal to 1 in the

00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:23.610
complex plane is a circle.

00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:28.880
And that circle, in fact,
is a circle of radius 1.

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:33.370
And so it's on this contour
in the z-plane that the

00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:38.820
z-transform reduces to the
Fourier transform.

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:40.760
And we'll see some additional
significance of

00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:43.550
that as we go along.

00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:47.010
Just again to emphasize the
relationships and differences

00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:51.150
with continuous-time, with the
Laplace transform it's the

00:23:51.150 --> 00:23:56.430
behavior in the s-plane on the
j omega axis that corresponds

00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:58.440
to the Fourier transform.

00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:02.440
Here it's the behavior on the
unit circle where the

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:07.570
z-transform corresponds to
the Fourier transform.

00:24:07.570 --> 00:24:08.930
Now, we'll be talking--

00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:12.460
as we did with the Laplace
transform, we'll be talking

00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:18.140
very often about transforms
which are rational, and

00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:23.820
rational transforms as we'll
see, represent systems which

00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:25.960
are characterized by linear
constant coefficient

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:27.700
difference equations.

00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:35.510
And so for the rational
z-transforms, we'll again find

00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:38.530
it convenient to use a
representation in terms of

00:24:38.530 --> 00:24:40.870
poles and zeroes
in the z-plane.

00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:45.420
So let's look at our example
as we've worked it out

00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:47.920
previously, Example 10.1.

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:54.170
And with this sequence, the
z-transform is 1 divided by 1

00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:56.360
minus a z to the minus 1.

00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:59.350
And we happen to have written
it as a function of z

00:24:59.350 --> 00:25:00.950
to the minus 1.

00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:06.200
Clearly, we can rewrite this by
multiplying numerator and

00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:09.900
denominator by z, and this would
equivalently then be z

00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:13.470
divided by z minus a.

00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:19.220
And so if we were to represent
this through a pole-zero plot,

00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:22.370
we would have a 0 at the origin
corresponding to this

00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:27.340
factor and a pole at z equals
a corresponding to the

00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:29.270
denominator factor.

00:25:29.270 --> 00:25:34.730
And so the pole-zero pattern for
this is then a pole at z

00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:40.190
equal to a and a 0
at the origin.

00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:44.415
Now, let me just comment quickly
about the fact that we

00:25:44.415 --> 00:25:48.440
had written this as 1 over 1
minus a z to the minus 1, and

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:51.730
that seems kind of strange
because perhaps we should have

00:25:51.730 --> 00:25:54.160
multiplied through by z.

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:58.350
Let me just indicate that as
you'll see as you work

00:25:58.350 --> 00:26:03.680
examples, it's very typical for
the z-transform to come

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:06.910
out as a function of
z to the minus 1.

00:26:06.910 --> 00:26:11.820
And so very typically, you'll
get to recognize that things

00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:15.980
will be expressed in terms of
factors involving terms like 1

00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:20.380
minus a z to the minus 1, rather
than factors of the

00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:23.320
form z minus a.

00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:28.740
Well, here is the one example
that we had referred to.

00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:33.910
And if we consider another
example, the other example,

00:26:33.910 --> 00:26:40.780
which was example 10.2 consists
of an algebraic

00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:43.640
expression as I indicate here.

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:47.660
But its region of validity is
the magnitude of z less than

00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:49.240
the magnitude of a.

00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:53.850
And that corresponds to the
same pole-zero plot, but a

00:26:53.850 --> 00:26:59.230
region of convergence which
is inside this circle.

00:26:59.230 --> 00:27:05.400
Whereas, in the previous case,
with the pole-zero plot, we

00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:09.010
had a region of convergence
which was for the magnitude of

00:27:09.010 --> 00:27:11.740
z greater than the
magnitude of a.

00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:15.610
So these two examples, this one
and the other one, have

00:27:15.610 --> 00:27:18.350
exactly the same pole-zero
pattern and they're

00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:22.530
distinguished by their region
of convergence.

00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:29.210
Now, notice incidentally that
in this particular case, the

00:27:29.210 --> 00:27:32.810
region of convergence includes
the unit circle provided that

00:27:32.810 --> 00:27:35.240
the magnitude of a
is less than 1.

00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:41.470
And so, in fact, that would say
that the sequence has a

00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:43.460
Fourier transform
that converges.

00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:47.410
Namely, with the magnitude
of z equal to 1.

00:27:47.410 --> 00:27:52.020
Whereas, in this example, the
region of convergence does not

00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:54.140
include the unit circle.

00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:57.540
And so, in fact, we cannot
look at x of z for the

00:27:57.540 --> 00:27:59.570
magnitude of z equal to 1.

00:27:59.570 --> 00:28:03.850
And so this example, with the
magnitude of a less than 1,

00:28:03.850 --> 00:28:07.950
does not have a Fourier
transform that converges.

00:28:07.950 --> 00:28:12.160
Well, assuming that the
magnitude of a is less than 1

00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:16.010
and the Fourier transform
converges, we can, in fact,

00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:22.080
look at the Fourier transform
by observing what happens as

00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:24.460
we go around the unit circle.

00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:26.910
We had seen this with the
Laplace transform in terms of

00:28:26.910 --> 00:28:31.010
observing what happened as we
move along the j omega axis.

00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:39.620
And here again, we can use the
vectors as we trace out the

00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:41.060
unit circle.

00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:43.790
And in particular, what we would
be looking at in this

00:28:43.790 --> 00:28:51.510
case is the ratio of the zero
vector to the pole vector.

00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:53.960
For example, if we were looking
at the magnitude of

00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:58.120
the z-transform, the magnitude
of the z-transform would be

00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:02.520
the ratio of the length of this
vector to the length of

00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:04.200
this vector.

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:08.130
And to observe the Fourier
transform, we would observe

00:29:08.130 --> 00:29:13.090
how those vectors change in
length as we move around the

00:29:13.090 --> 00:29:15.030
unit circle.

00:29:15.030 --> 00:29:18.030
And as we move around the unit
circle, what we would trace

00:29:18.030 --> 00:29:21.730
out in terms of the ratio of the
lengths of those vectors

00:29:21.730 --> 00:29:23.835
is the Fourier transform.

00:29:26.910 --> 00:29:36.690
Well, let's focus on that also
in the context of a slightly

00:29:36.690 --> 00:29:37.855
different z-transform.

00:29:37.855 --> 00:29:43.260
In the z-transform here as we'll
see in a later lecture,

00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:45.800
is the z-transform associated
with a second

00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:48.070
order difference equation.

00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:52.460
It has a denominator factor
which has two poles

00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:54.810
associated with it.

00:29:54.810 --> 00:30:00.730
And so here, if we assumed that
the Fourier transform of

00:30:00.730 --> 00:30:05.360
the associated sequence
converged, then again we would

00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:08.080
look at the behavior
of this as we moved

00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:10.040
around the unit circle.

00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:14.730
And the ratio of the lengths
of the appropriate vectors

00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:19.060
would describe for us the
frequency response.

00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:21.220
I'm sorry, the Fourier
transform.

00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:27.800
So the Fourier transform
magnitude would consist of the

00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:32.830
ratio of the lengths of the zero
vectors divided by the

00:30:32.830 --> 00:30:34.930
lengths of the pole vectors.

00:30:34.930 --> 00:30:39.350
And one thing that we observe
is that as we move in

00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:44.290
frequency omega in the vicinity
of this pole, this

00:30:44.290 --> 00:30:49.260
pole vector, in fact, reaches
a minimum length.

00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:54.170
That would mean that it's
reciprocal would be maximum.

00:30:54.170 --> 00:30:57.290
And then, as we sweep past,
the lengths of these two

00:30:57.290 --> 00:30:58.380
vectors would increase.

00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:02.040
The zero vectors, of course,
would retain the same length

00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:05.940
no matter where we were
on the unit circle.

00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:08.500
So, in fact, if we looked
at the Fourier transform

00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:12.320
associated with this pole-zero
pattern, if this was, for

00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:20.760
example, represented the
z-transform of the impulse

00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:24.220
response or a linear
time-invariant system, the

00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:27.040
corresponding frequency response
would be what I

00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:28.970
plotted out below.

00:31:28.970 --> 00:31:31.810
And so it would peak.

00:31:31.810 --> 00:31:35.560
And in fact, where it would peak
is in the vicinity of the

00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:42.220
frequency location of the pole
as I indicate up here.

00:31:45.950 --> 00:31:51.530
So as we sweep past this pole
then, in fact, this Fourier

00:31:51.530 --> 00:31:52.560
transform .

00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:54.550
Peaks.

00:31:54.550 --> 00:31:59.060
Well, this notion of looking at
the frequency response as

00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:04.210
we move around the unit circle
is a very important notion.

00:32:04.210 --> 00:32:06.610
And it's important to recognize
it's the unit circle

00:32:06.610 --> 00:32:10.060
we're talking about here,
whereas before we were talking

00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:12.740
about the j omega axis.

00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:18.470
And to emphasize this further,
let me just show this example.

00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:22.900
And in fact, the previous
example with the computer

00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:26.730
displays, so that we can see the
frequency response as it

00:32:26.730 --> 00:32:31.100
sweeps out as we go around
the unit circle.

00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:36.350
So here we have the pole-zero
pattern for the

00:32:36.350 --> 00:32:38.640
second order example.

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:42.780
And to generate the Fourier
transform, we want to look at

00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:46.360
the behavior of the pole and
zero vectors as we move around

00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:47.970
the unit circle.

00:32:47.970 --> 00:32:51.200
So first, let's display
the vectors.

00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:55.030
And here we have them displayed
to the point

00:32:55.030 --> 00:32:58.250
corresponding to
zero frequency.

00:32:58.250 --> 00:33:03.750
And the magnitude of the Fourier
transform will be, as

00:33:03.750 --> 00:33:06.650
we discussed, the magnitude of
the length of the zero vector

00:33:06.650 --> 00:33:08.380
is divided by the
magnitude of the

00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:10.580
length of the pole vectors.

00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:14.760
Shown below will be the
Fourier transform.

00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:18.440
And we have the Fourier
transform displayed here from

00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:23.300
0 to 2 pi, rather than from
minus pi to pi as it was

00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:25.640
displayed in the transparency.

00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:29.130
Because of the periodicity of
the Fourier transform, both of

00:33:29.130 --> 00:33:32.440
those are equivalent.

00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:38.400
Now we're sweeping away from
omega equals 0 and the lengths

00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:40.590
of the pole vectors
have changed.

00:33:40.590 --> 00:33:43.100
And that, of course,
generates a change

00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:46.390
in the Fourier transform.

00:33:46.390 --> 00:33:51.530
And as we continued the
process further, if we

00:33:51.530 --> 00:33:57.440
increase frequency, as we sweep
closer to the location

00:33:57.440 --> 00:34:02.060
of the pole, the pole vector
decreases in length

00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:03.370
dramatically.

00:34:03.370 --> 00:34:07.400
And that generates a residence
in the Fourier transform, very

00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:11.040
similar to what we saw
in continuous-time.

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:16.875
Now as we continue to sweep
further, what will happen is

00:34:16.875 --> 00:34:19.949
that that pole vector
will begin to

00:34:19.949 --> 00:34:22.050
increase in length again.

00:34:22.050 --> 00:34:25.300
And so, in fact, the magnitude
of the Fourier

00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:28.730
transform will decrease.

00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:32.889
And we see that here
as we sweep toward

00:34:32.889 --> 00:34:35.250
omega equal to pi.

00:34:35.250 --> 00:34:39.830
Now, notice in this process that
the length of the zero

00:34:39.830 --> 00:34:44.929
vectors has stayed the same
because of the fact that the

00:34:44.929 --> 00:34:49.429
zeroes are at the origin, and no
matter where we are in the

00:34:49.429 --> 00:34:52.420
unit circle, the length of
those vectors is unity.

00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:55.650
So they don't influence in this
example the magnitude,

00:34:55.650 --> 00:34:59.420
but they would, of course,
influence the phase.

00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:02.600
Now we want to continue sweeping
from omega equal to

00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:04.960
pi around to 2 pi.

00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:08.280
And because of the symmetry in
the Fourier transform, what we

00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:12.310
will see in the magnitude is
identical to what we would see

00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:16.880
if we swept from omega equal
to pi back clockwise to

00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:19.630
omega equals 0.

00:35:19.630 --> 00:35:23.670
In particular now, as we're
increasing frequency, notice

00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:27.550
that the length of the pole
vector associated with the

00:35:27.550 --> 00:35:30.740
lower half plane pole
is decreasing.

00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:35.370
And so, in fact, that
corresponds to generating a

00:35:35.370 --> 00:35:39.540
resonance as we sweep
past that pole

00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:42.630
location as we are here.

00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:46.380
And then finally, that pole
vector increases in length as

00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:49.760
we begin to approach omega
equal to 2 pi.

00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:53.700
Or equivalently, as we approach
omega equal to 0.

00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:05.610
Now finally, let's also look
at the Fourier transform

00:36:05.610 --> 00:36:08.670
associated with the first
order example that we

00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:11.370
discussed earlier
in the lecture.

00:36:11.370 --> 00:36:16.140
And so what we'll want to look
at is the Fourier transform as

00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:18.990
the pole and zero
vectors change.

00:36:18.990 --> 00:36:22.150
Once again, the Fourier
transform will be displayed on

00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:25.950
a scale from 0 to 2 pi, a
frequency scale from 0 to 2

00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:29.060
pi, rather than minus
pi to pi.

00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:32.600
And we want to observe the pole
and zero vectors as we

00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:34.010
sweep around the unit circle.

00:36:38.670 --> 00:36:42.420
We display first the pole
and zero vectors at

00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:44.960
omega equal to 0.

00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:52.140
And as the frequency increases,
the pole vector

00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:53.910
increases in length.

00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:57.640
The zero vector, since the zero
is at the origin, will

00:36:57.640 --> 00:37:00.190
have constant length
no matter where we

00:37:00.190 --> 00:37:01.430
are on the unit circle.

00:37:01.430 --> 00:37:04.470
Although it would affect the
phase, which we are not

00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:06.000
displaying here.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:09.520
And so the principle effect, the
only effect really on the

00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:12.540
magnitude, is due to
the pole vector.

00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:17.470
As the frequency continues to
increase, the pole vector

00:37:17.470 --> 00:37:21.890
increases in length,
monotonically in fact.

00:37:21.890 --> 00:37:25.190
And so that means that the
magnitude of the Fourier

00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:30.700
transform will decrease
monotonically until we get

00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:33.030
past omega equal to pi.

00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:48.910
Here we are now at omega
equal to pi.

00:37:48.910 --> 00:37:54.360
And when we continue sweeping
past this frequency around to

00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:59.860
2 pi, then we will see basically
the same curve swept

00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:01.320
out in reverse.

00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:04.210
Since because of the symmetry,
again, of the Fourier

00:38:04.210 --> 00:38:10.190
transform magnitude, sweeping
from pi to 2 pi is going to be

00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:13.740
equivalent with regard to the
magnitude to sweeping

00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:17.400
from pi back to 0.

00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:21.730
And so now the pole vector
begins to decrease in length

00:38:21.730 --> 00:38:25.140
and correspondingly, the
magnitude of the Fourier

00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:29.070
transform will increase.

00:38:29.070 --> 00:38:33.130
And that will continue until we
get around to omega equal

00:38:33.130 --> 00:38:36.265
to 2 pi, which is equivalent,
of course, to

00:38:36.265 --> 00:38:38.020
omega equal to 0.

00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:41.430
And obviously, if we continue
to sweep around again, we

00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:46.500
would simply trace out other
periods associated with the

00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:47.750
Fourier transform.

00:38:55.550 --> 00:39:00.270
Well, that hopefully gives you
kind of some feel for the

00:39:00.270 --> 00:39:02.760
notion of sweeping around
the unit circle.

00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:06.430
And of course, you can see that
because the circle is

00:39:06.430 --> 00:39:09.520
periodic as we go around and
around, of course, what we'll

00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:13.130
get is a periodic Fourier
transform, which is the way

00:39:13.130 --> 00:39:16.990
Fourier transforms are
supposed to be.

00:39:16.990 --> 00:39:26.830
Now, just as with the Laplace
transform, the region of

00:39:26.830 --> 00:39:30.780
convergence of the z-transform,
as we've seen in

00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:36.240
this example, is a very
important part of the

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:39.430
specification of the
z-transform.

00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:42.690
And we can, in talking about
sequences and their

00:39:42.690 --> 00:39:46.100
transforms, either specify
the region of convergence

00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:49.730
implicitly, or we can specify
it explicitly.

00:39:49.730 --> 00:39:52.870
We can, for example, say what
it is, as let's say the

00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:56.020
magnitude of z being greater
than the magnitude of a.

00:39:56.020 --> 00:40:00.830
Or we can recognize that the
region of convergence has

00:40:00.830 --> 00:40:06.020
certain constraints associated
with certain properties of the

00:40:06.020 --> 00:40:07.480
time function.

00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:14.370
And in particular, there are
some important properties of

00:40:14.370 --> 00:40:20.060
the region of convergence which
allow us, given that we

00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:23.540
know certain characteristics of
the time function, to then

00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:26.440
identify the region of
convergence by looking at the

00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:27.940
pole-zero pattern.

00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:32.420
For example, we recognize that
the region of convergence does

00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:37.800
not contain any poles because of
the fact that at poles, the

00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:42.010
z-transform, in fact, blows up
and, of course, can't converge

00:40:42.010 --> 00:40:44.060
at that point.

00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:48.480
Furthermore, the region of
convergence consists of a ring

00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:52.420
in the z-plane centered
about the origin.

00:40:52.420 --> 00:40:55.750
Recall that with the Laplace
transform, the region of

00:40:55.750 --> 00:40:59.220
convergence consisted of
strips in the s-plane.

00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:04.380
With the z-transform, the region
of convergence consists

00:41:04.380 --> 00:41:07.880
of a ring, basically because of
the fact that the region of

00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:12.490
convergence is dependent
on the magnitude of z.

00:41:12.490 --> 00:41:14.990
Whereas, with the Laplace
transform, the region of

00:41:14.990 --> 00:41:18.310
convergence was dependent
on the real part of s.

00:41:18.310 --> 00:41:21.510
The fact that it's the magnitude
of z says, in

00:41:21.510 --> 00:41:25.580
effect, that all values of z
that have the same magnitude

00:41:25.580 --> 00:41:27.350
lie on a circle.

00:41:27.350 --> 00:41:29.900
And so the region of convergence
you would expect

00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:36.420
to be a concentric ring
in the z-plane.

00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:40.000
Furthermore, as we've already
talked about and exploited

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:44.130
actually, convergence of the
Fourier transform is

00:41:44.130 --> 00:41:47.720
equivalent to the statement that
the region of convergence

00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:49.530
includes the unit circle
in the z-plane.

00:41:52.130 --> 00:41:57.420
Now, we can also associate the
region of convergence with

00:41:57.420 --> 00:42:01.700
issues about whether the
sequence is of finite duration

00:42:01.700 --> 00:42:04.610
or right-sided or left-sided.

00:42:04.610 --> 00:42:09.920
And let me sort of quickly
indicate again what the style

00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:12.550
of the argument is.

00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:17.840
If we have a finite duration
sequence, so that the sequence

00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:20.580
is absolutely summable, and
therefore has a Fourier

00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:25.590
transform that converges, then
because of the fact that it's

00:42:25.590 --> 00:42:30.210
0 outside some interval,
I can multiply it by an

00:42:30.210 --> 00:42:35.070
exponentially decaying
sequence or by an

00:42:35.070 --> 00:42:37.340
exponentially growing
sequence.

00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:41.170
And since I'm only doing this
over a finite interval, no

00:42:41.170 --> 00:42:45.030
matter how I choose that
exponential, we'll end up with

00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:47.130
an absolutely summable
product.

00:42:47.130 --> 00:42:51.610
So if x of n is a finite
duration, then in fact the

00:42:51.610 --> 00:42:56.590
region of convergence is the
entire z-plane, possibly with

00:42:56.590 --> 00:42:58.935
the exception of the
origin or infinity.

00:43:01.820 --> 00:43:06.490
On the other hand, if the
sequence is a right-sided

00:43:06.490 --> 00:43:12.390
sequence, then we have to be
careful that we don't multiply

00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:17.290
by an exponential that grows
too fast for positive time.

00:43:17.290 --> 00:43:22.300
Or equivalently, we might have
to choose the exponential so

00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:26.720
that it decays sufficiently
fast for positive time.

00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:31.240
As a consequence of that, for a
right-sided sequence, if we

00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:36.730
have a value which is in the
region of convergence, as long

00:43:36.730 --> 00:43:40.950
as I multiply by exponentials
that decay faster than that

00:43:40.950 --> 00:43:47.020
for positive time, then I'll
also have convergence.

00:43:47.020 --> 00:43:50.630
In other words, all finite
values of z for which the

00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:53.710
magnitude of z is greater than
this, so that the exponentials

00:43:53.710 --> 00:43:56.760
die off even faster will also
be in the region of

00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:59.300
convergence.

00:43:59.300 --> 00:44:01.810
If we combine that statement
with the fact that there are

00:44:01.810 --> 00:44:05.320
no poles in the region of
convergence, then we end up

00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:07.150
with a statement similar
to what we had

00:44:07.150 --> 00:44:09.000
with the Laplace transform.

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:14.430
Here, the statement is that if
the sequence is right-sided,

00:44:14.430 --> 00:44:19.160
then the region of convergence
has to be outside the

00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:20.560
outermost pole.

00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:23.610
Essentially, because it has to
be outside someplace and can't

00:44:23.610 --> 00:44:24.860
include any poles.

00:44:27.220 --> 00:44:36.110
Finally, if we have a left-sided
sequence, then if

00:44:36.110 --> 00:44:39.230
we have a value which is in the
region of convergence, all

00:44:39.230 --> 00:44:42.390
values for which the magnitude
of z is less than that will

00:44:42.390 --> 00:44:44.630
also be in the region
of convergence.

00:44:44.630 --> 00:44:48.680
Or if x of z is rational, then
the region of convergence must

00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:51.130
be inside the innermost pole.

00:44:51.130 --> 00:44:56.610
And finally, if we have a
two-sided sequence, then

00:44:56.610 --> 00:45:00.130
there's kind of a balance
between the exponential factor

00:45:00.130 --> 00:45:01.590
that we use.

00:45:01.590 --> 00:45:05.980
And so in that case, then the
region of convergence will be

00:45:05.980 --> 00:45:09.880
a ring in the z-plane, and
essentially will extend

00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:12.880
outward to a pole and
inward to a pole.

00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:19.700
So if we had an algebraic
expression, let's say as we

00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:28.150
have here, then we could
associate with that a region

00:45:28.150 --> 00:45:30.980
of convergence outside
this pole.

00:45:30.980 --> 00:45:34.770
And that would correspond to
a right-sided sequence.

00:45:34.770 --> 00:45:40.010
Or we can associate with it a
region of convergence, which

00:45:40.010 --> 00:45:45.120
is inside the innermost pole.

00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:48.440
And that would correspond to
a left-sided sequence.

00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:53.890
And the third and only other
possibility is a region of

00:45:53.890 --> 00:45:58.330
convergence which lies between
these two poles.

00:45:58.330 --> 00:46:02.980
And that would then correspond
to a two-sided sequence.

00:46:02.980 --> 00:46:05.070
And notice incidentally because
of where I've placed

00:46:05.070 --> 00:46:08.700
these poles, that this is the
only one for which the region

00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:11.130
of convergence includes
the unit circle.

00:46:11.130 --> 00:46:14.670
In other words, it's the only
one for which the Fourier

00:46:14.670 --> 00:46:17.220
transform converges.

00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:19.830
OK, now we've moved through
that fairly quickly.

00:46:19.830 --> 00:46:24.560
And I've emphasized the fact
that it parallels very closely

00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:27.570
what we did with the
Laplace transform.

00:46:27.570 --> 00:46:32.140
What I'd like to do is just
conclude with a discussion of

00:46:32.140 --> 00:46:37.600
how we get the time function
back again when we have the

00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:42.150
z-transform including its
region of convergence.

00:46:42.150 --> 00:46:45.780
Well, we can, first of all,
develop a more or less formal

00:46:45.780 --> 00:46:46.580
expression.

00:46:46.580 --> 00:46:50.910
And the algebra for this is gone
through in the text, and

00:46:50.910 --> 00:46:53.300
you went through something
similar to this with the

00:46:53.300 --> 00:46:56.510
Laplace transform in the
video course manual.

00:46:56.510 --> 00:46:59.350
So I won't carry through
the details.

00:46:59.350 --> 00:47:04.130
But basically, what we can use
to develop a formal expression

00:47:04.130 --> 00:47:08.320
is the fact that the z-transform
is the Fourier

00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:11.550
transform of the sequence
exponentially weighted.

00:47:11.550 --> 00:47:16.550
So we can apply the inverse
transform to that, and that

00:47:16.550 --> 00:47:19.720
gives us not x of n, but x of
n exponentially weighted.

00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:24.540
And if we track that through,
then what we'll end up with is

00:47:24.540 --> 00:47:26.020
an expression.

00:47:26.020 --> 00:47:28.950
After we've taken care of a
few of the epsilons and

00:47:28.950 --> 00:47:33.410
deltas, we'll end up with an
expression that expresses

00:47:33.410 --> 00:47:41.000
formally the sequence x of n in
terms of the z-transform,

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:43.830
where this, in fact, is a
contour integral in the

00:47:43.830 --> 00:47:45.390
complex plane.

00:47:45.390 --> 00:47:49.300
And so there's a formal
expression, just as there's a

00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:52.280
formal expression for the
Laplace transform.

00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:58.900
But in fact, the more typical
procedure is to use

00:47:58.900 --> 00:48:03.630
essentially transformed pairs
that we know together with the

00:48:03.630 --> 00:48:07.350
idea of using a partial
fraction expansion.

00:48:07.350 --> 00:48:15.460
So if we had a z-transform as
I indicate here, and if we

00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:21.120
expand it out in a partial
fraction expansion, then we

00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:26.580
can recognize, as we did in a
similar style with the Laplace

00:48:26.580 --> 00:48:27.860
transform--

00:48:27.860 --> 00:48:33.090
we can recognize that each
term, together with the

00:48:33.090 --> 00:48:38.450
identified region of convergence
corresponds to an

00:48:38.450 --> 00:48:40.240
exponential factor.

00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:44.420
And so this term, together with
the fact we know that the

00:48:44.420 --> 00:48:49.960
magnitude of z must be greater
than 2, allows us to recognize

00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:54.800
this as similar to
the Example 10.1.

00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:58.800
And in particular then, the
sequence associated with that

00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:00.970
is what I indicate here.

00:49:00.970 --> 00:49:04.230
And for the second term,
the sequence is

00:49:04.230 --> 00:49:06.070
what I indicate here.

00:49:06.070 --> 00:49:11.260
So what we're simply doing is
using the fact that we've

00:49:11.260 --> 00:49:15.850
worked out the example going one
direction before, and now

00:49:15.850 --> 00:49:19.350
we use that together with the
partial fraction expansion to

00:49:19.350 --> 00:49:23.240
get the individual sequences
back again, and

00:49:23.240 --> 00:49:24.720
then add them together.

00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:27.790
There's one other method which
I'll just point to, which is

00:49:27.790 --> 00:49:31.370
also elaborated on a little
more in the text.

00:49:31.370 --> 00:49:35.860
But it's kind of the idea of
developing the inverse

00:49:35.860 --> 00:49:42.570
z-transform by recognizing that
this z-transform formula,

00:49:42.570 --> 00:49:46.900
in fact, is a power series.

00:49:46.900 --> 00:49:54.130
So if we take x of z and expand
it in a power series,

00:49:54.130 --> 00:49:59.640
then we can pick off the
values of x of n by

00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:01.350
identifying the individual

00:50:01.350 --> 00:50:02.945
coefficients in this expansion.

00:50:06.070 --> 00:50:11.780
And so by simply doing long
division, for example, we can

00:50:11.780 --> 00:50:14.750
also get the inverse
transform.

00:50:14.750 --> 00:50:17.650
And that, by the way,
is very useful.

00:50:17.650 --> 00:50:23.330
Particularly if we want to get
the inverse z-transform for a

00:50:23.330 --> 00:50:27.700
z-transform expression,
which is not rational.

00:50:27.700 --> 00:50:30.330
Now we've moved through
this fairly quickly.

00:50:30.330 --> 00:50:33.080
On the other hand, I've stressed
that it's very

00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:36.220
similar to what we went through
for the Laplace

00:50:36.220 --> 00:50:41.320
transform, except for a very
important difference.

00:50:41.320 --> 00:50:44.390
The principal difference really
being that with the

00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:48.580
Laplace transform, it was the
j omega axis in the s-plane

00:50:48.580 --> 00:50:51.300
that we focused attention on
when we were thinking about

00:50:51.300 --> 00:50:52.970
the Fourier transform.

00:50:52.970 --> 00:50:56.230
Here, the unit circle
in the z-plane plays

00:50:56.230 --> 00:50:58.580
an important role.

00:50:58.580 --> 00:51:01.900
What we'll see when we continue
this in the next

00:51:01.900 --> 00:51:07.250
lecture is that there are
properties of the z-transform,

00:51:07.250 --> 00:51:10.630
just as there were properties
of the Laplace transform.

00:51:10.630 --> 00:51:16.910
And those properties allow us
to develop and exploit the

00:51:16.910 --> 00:51:21.860
z-transform in the context of
systems describable by linear

00:51:21.860 --> 00:51:24.250
constant coefficient difference
equations.

00:51:24.250 --> 00:51:28.420
So in the next lecture, we'll
focus on some properties of

00:51:28.420 --> 00:51:31.970
the z-transform, and then we'll
see how to use those

00:51:31.970 --> 00:51:37.030
properties to help us in getting
further insight and

00:51:37.030 --> 00:51:38.870
working with systems
describable

00:51:38.870 --> 00:51:40.580
by difference equations.

00:51:40.580 --> 00:51:41.830
Thank you.
