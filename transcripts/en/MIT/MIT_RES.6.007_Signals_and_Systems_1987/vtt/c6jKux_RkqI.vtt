00:00:55.306 --> 00:00:57.270
PROFESSOR: Over the past
several lectures, we've

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.880
developed a representation for
linear time-invariant systems.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.500
A particularly important set of
systems, which are linear

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.700
and time-invariant, are those
that are represented by linear

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.240
constant-coefficient
differential equations in

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.950
continuous time or linear
constant-coefficient

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.630
difference equations
in discrete time.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.780
For example, electrical circuits
that are built, let's

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.300
say, out of resistors,
inductors, and capacitors,

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.780
perhaps with op-amps, correspond
to systems

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.150
described by differential
equations.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.690
Mechanical systems with
springs and dashpots,

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.010
likewise, are described by
differential equations.

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.300
And in the discrete-time case,
things such as moving average

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.470
filters, digital filters, and
most simple kinds of data

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.840
smoothing are all linear
constant-coefficient

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.110
difference equations.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:55.180
Now, presumably in a previous
course, you've had some

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:00.260
exposure to differential
equations for continuous time,

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.000
and their solution using
notions like particular

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.220
solution, and homogeneous
solution, initial

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.380
conditions, et cetera.

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.760
Later on in the course, when
we've developed the concept of

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.450
the Fourier transform after
that, the Laplace transform,

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.500
we'll see some very efficient
and useful ways of generating

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.160
solutions, both for
differential

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.010
and difference equations.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.620
At this point, however, I'd like
to just introduce linear

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.020
constant-coefficient
differential equations and

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.130
their discrete-time
counterpart.

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.890
And address, among other things,
the issue of when they

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.650
do and don't correspond to
linear time-invariant systems.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.420
Well, let's first consider
what I refer to as an

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.010
nth-order linear
constant-coefficient

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.270
differential equation, as
I've indicated here.

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.350
And what it consists of is
a linear combination of

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.560
derivatives of the system
output, y(t), equal to a

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.660
linear combination of
derivatives of the system

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.300
input x(t).

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.470
And it's referred to as a
constant-coefficient equation,

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.550
of course, because the
coefficients are constant.

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.670
In other words, not assumed
to be time-varying.

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:25.200
And it's referred to as linear
because it corresponds to a

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.820
linear combination of these
derivatives, not because it

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.620
corresponds to a
linear system.

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.910
And, in fact, as we'll see,
or as I'll indicate, this

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.340
equation may or may
not, in fact,

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.410
correspond to a linear system.

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:47.500
In the discrete-time case, the
corresponding equation is a

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.710
linear constant-coefficient
difference equation.

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:55.650
And that corresponds to, again,
a linear combination of

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.370
delayed versions of the output
equal to a linear combination

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.630
of delayed versions
of the input.

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.590
This equation is referred to an

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.290
nth-order difference equation.

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.750
The n referring to the number
of delays of the output

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.690
involved, just as an Nth-order
differential equation, the n

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.230
or the order of the equation
refers to the number of

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:21.050
derivatives of the output.

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:25.150
Now, let's first begin with
linear constant-coefficient

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.170
differential equations.

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:34.290
And the basic point of the
solution for the differential

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:40.300
equations is the fact that if
we've generated some solution,

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.600
which I refer to here as y_p(t),
some solution to the

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:49.890
equation for a given input,
then, in fact, we can add to

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:55.750
that solution any other solution
which satisfies

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.910
what's referred to as the
homogeneous equation.

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:06.620
So in fact, this differential
equation by itself is not a

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.300
unique specification
of the system.

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:15.360
If I have any solution, then I
can add to that solution any

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.950
other solution which satisfies
the homogeneous equation, and

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:22.140
the sum of those two will
likewise be a solution.

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:24.630
And that's very straightforward
to verify.

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.770
By simply substituting into the
differential equation, the

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:33.910
sum of a particular and the
homogeneous solution, and what

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:38.180
you'll see is that the
homogeneous contribution, in

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.950
fact, goes to zero by definition
of what we mean by

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:44.670
the homogeneous equation.

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:48.430
Now, the homogeneous solution
for a linear

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:53.290
constant-coefficient
differential equation is of

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:58.030
the form that I indicate
at the bottom.

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:07.230
And it typically consists of a
sum of N complex exponentials.

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:11.650
And the constants are
undetermined by

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:14.000
the equation itself.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.240
And this form for the
homogeneous solution, in

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:23.860
essence, drops out of examining
the homogeneous

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:28.890
equation, where if we assume
that the form of the

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:34.210
homogeneous solution is a
complex exponential with some

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:38.570
unspecified amplitude and
unspecified exponent.

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:43.580
If we substitute this into our
homogeneous equation, we end

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:46.510
up with the equation that
I've indicated here.

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:50.780
The factor A and the e^(st) can
in fact be canceled out,

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:56.110
and we find that that equation
is satisfied

00:06:56.110 --> 00:07:02.160
for N values of s.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:06.540
And that's true no matter what
choice is made for these

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:07.890
coefficients.

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:12.510
And the essential consequence
of all of that is that the

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:16.660
homogeneous solution is of
the form that I indicated

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:18.160
previously.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:26.010
Namely it consists of a sum of
N complex exponentials, where

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:29.720
the coefficients, the N
coefficients, attach to each

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:33.320
of those complex exponential
is undetermined or

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.980
unspecified.

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:39.710
So what this says is that in
order to obtain the solution

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:41.360
for a linear
constant-coefficient

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:44.750
differential equation, we need
some kind of auxiliary

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:49.760
information that tells us
is how to obtain these N

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:51.690
undetermined constants.

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:55.550
And there are variety of ways
of specifying this auxiliary

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:57.930
information or auxiliary
conditions.

00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:02.250
For example, in addition to
the differential equation,

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:10.000
what I can tell you is the value
of the output and N - 1

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.300
of its derivatives, at some
specified time, t_0.

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:20.590
And so the differential equation
together with the

00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:25.020
auxiliary information, the
initial conditions, then lets

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:28.760
you determine the total
solution, which namely lets

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:31.750
you determine these
previously-unspecified

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:35.130
coefficients in the homogeneous
solution.

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:39.120
Now, depending on how the
auxiliary information is

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:42.350
stated or what auxiliary
information is available, the

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:47.080
system may or may not correspond
to a linear system,

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:49.360
and may or may not correspond
to a linear

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:51.880
time-invariant system.

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:55.180
One essential condition for it
to correspond to a linear

00:08:55.180 --> 00:09:01.110
system is that the initial
conditions must be 0.

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:06.550
And one can see the reason for
that, if we refer back to the

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:10.090
previous lecture in which we saw
that for a linear system,

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:13.090
if we put 0 in, we get 0 out.

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:17.560
So if x(t), the input, is
0, the output must be 0.

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:20.710
And so that, in essence, tells
us that, at least for the

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:26.220
system to be linear, these
initial conditions must be 0.

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:33.380
Now, beyond that, if we want
the system to be causal and

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:38.890
linear and time-invariant, then
what's required on the

00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:42.840
initial conditions is that they
be consistent with what's

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:46.520
referred to as initial rest.

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:53.770
Initial rest says that the
output must be 0 up until the

00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:56.910
time that the input
becomes non-zero.

00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:59.590
And we can see, of course, that
that's consistent with

00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:03.150
the notion of causality,
as we talked about in

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:04.730
the previous lecture.

00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:10.400
And it's relatively
straightforward to see that if

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:14.920
the system is causal and linear
and time-invariant,

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:18.810
that will require
initial rest.

00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:23.600
It's somewhat more difficult
to see that if we specify

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:27.410
initial rest, then that, in
fact, is sufficient to

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:31.040
determine that the system is
both causal and linear and

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:32.100
time invariant.

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:35.730
But the essential point then
is that it requires initial

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:40.500
rest for both linearity
and causality.

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:46.360
OK, well, let's look at an
example, and let's take the

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:52.580
example of a first-order
differential equation, as I've

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:54.470
indicated here.

00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:58.623
So we have a first-order
differential equation, dy(t) /

00:10:58.623 --> 00:11:03.350
dt + ay(t) is the input x(t).

00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:07.360
And let's first look at what
the homogeneous solution of

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:08.500
this equation is.

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:13.370
And so, we consider the
homogeneous equation, namely

00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:17.600
the equation that specifies
solutions, which would

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:20.650
correspond to 0 input.

00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:27.180
We, in essence, guess, or impose
a solution of the form.

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:31.590
The homogeneous solution is an
amplitude factor times a

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:33.450
complex exponential.

00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:38.390
Substituting this into the
homogeneous equation, we then

00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:40.860
get the equation that
I've indicated here.

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:45.780
What you can see is that in this
equation, I can cancel

00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:50.530
out the amplitude factor and
this complex exponential.

00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:56.590
So let's just cancel those out
on both sides of the equation.

00:11:56.590 --> 00:12:02.340
And what we're left with is an
equation that specifies what

00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:04.760
the complex exponent must be.

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:08.110
In particular, for the
homogeneous solution, s must

00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:12.060
be equal to -a, and so finally,
our homogeneous

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:16.380
solution is as I've
indicated here.

00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:23.150
Now, let's look at the solution
for a specific input.

00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:25.990
Let's consider, for example,
an input which is

00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:28.000
a scaled unit step.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.530
And although I won't work out
the solution in detail and

00:12:31.530 --> 00:12:36.510
perhaps using what you've worked
on previously, you know

00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:39.805
how to carry out the
solution for that.

00:12:39.805 --> 00:12:44.950
A solution with a step input is
what I've indicated here: a

00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:47.060
scalar, 1 minus an exponential,

00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:48.540
times a unit step.

00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:51.430
And you can verify that simply
by substituting into the

00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:53.170
differential equation.

00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:56.930
Now, we know that there's
a family of solutions.

00:12:56.930 --> 00:13:02.620
In other words, any solution
with a homogeneous solution

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:04.990
added to it, is, again,
a solution.

00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:08.670
And so if we consider the
solution that I just

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:13.160
indicated, we generate the
entire family of solutions by

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:17.440
adding a homogeneous solution
to it, and so this then

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:21.400
corresponds to the entire family
of solutions, where the

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:27.640
constant A is unspecified so
far, and needs to be specified

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:31.470
through some type of auxiliary
conditions.

00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:36.640
Now, a class of auxiliary
conditions is the condition of

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:41.310
initial rest, which as I
indicated before, is

00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:44.830
equivalent to the statement that
the system is causal and

00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:46.900
linear and time-invariant.

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:52.080
And in that case, for the
initial rest condition, we

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:56.660
would then require in this
equation above that this

00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:59.710
constant be equal to 0.

00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:04.860
And so finally, the response
to a scaled step--

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:07.730
if the system is to correspond
to a causal linear

00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:12.760
time-invariant system, is then
just this term, namely, a

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:18.870
constant times 1 minus an
exponential, times the step.

00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:23.060
Now, if the system is a linear
time-invariant system, it can,

00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:26.260
as we know, be described through
its impulse response.

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:30.420
And as you've worked out
previously in the video course

00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:34.730
manual, for a linear
time-invariant system, the

00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:36.480
impulse response is the

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:38.750
derivative of the step response.

00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:41.730
And just to quickly remind
you of where that

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:43.960
result comes from.

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:48.020
In essence, we can consider
two linear time-invariant

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:51.770
systems in cascade, one a
differentiator, the other the

00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:55.060
system that we're talking
about described by the

00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:56.850
differential equation.

00:14:56.850 --> 00:15:01.700
And a step in here then
generates an impulse into our

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:04.600
system, and out comes the
impulse response.

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:07.100
Well, just using the fact that
these are both linear

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:10.840
time-invariant systems, and they
can be cascaded in either

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:15.970
order, then means that if we
have the step response to our

00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:20.380
system, and that goes through
the differentiator, what must

00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:24.570
come out, again, is the
impulse response.

00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:27.380
So differentiating the
step response, we

00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:29.310
get the impulse response.

00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:33.240
Here again, is the step response
as we just worked it

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:35.990
out, this time for
a unit step.

00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:40.760
If we differentiate, we have
then, since the step response

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:44.120
is the product of two terms, the
derivative of a product is

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:45.940
the sum of the derivatives.

00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:49.640
And carrying that algebra
through, and using the fact

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:54.350
that the derivative of the step
is an impulse, finally we

00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:59.180
come down to this statement
for the impulse response.

00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:01.820
And then recognizing
that this is a time

00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:03.970
function times an impulse.

00:16:03.970 --> 00:16:07.800
And we know that if a time
function times an impulse

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:14.160
takes on the value at the time
that the impulse occurs, then

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:18.390
this term is simply 0.

00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:22.140
And the impulse response
then finally is an

00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:24.420
exponential of this form.

00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:28.390
And this is the decaying
exponential for a-positive,

00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:31.640
it's a growing exponential
for a-negative.

00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:38.480
And recall that, as we talked
about previously, a linear

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:42.400
time-invariant system is stable
if its impulse response

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:44.610
is absolutely integrable.

00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:49.760
For this particular case, this
impulse response is absolutely

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:56.250
integrable provided that the
exponential factor a is

00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:59.290
greater than 0.

00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:04.700
Okay, so what we've seen then is
the impulse response for a

00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:07.230
system described by a linear
constant-coefficient

00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:10.829
differential equation, where in
addition, we would impose

00:17:10.829 --> 00:17:15.069
causality, linearity, and
time-invariance, essentially,

00:17:15.069 --> 00:17:19.619
through the initial conditions
of initial rest.

00:17:19.619 --> 00:17:23.609
Now, pretty much the same kinds
of things happen with

00:17:23.609 --> 00:17:27.079
difference equations as we've
gone through with

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:29.740
differential equations.

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:33.820
In particular, again, let me
remind you of the form of an

00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:35.640
Nth order linear constant

00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:37.760
coefficient difference equation.

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:40.820
It's as I indicate here.

00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:44.390
And, again, a linear
combination, this time of

00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:48.220
delayed versions of the output
equal to a linear combination

00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:51.520
of delayed versions
of the input.

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:57.210
Once again, difference equation
is not a complete

00:17:57.210 --> 00:18:00.310
specification of the system
because we can add to the

00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:03.820
response any homogeneous
solution.

00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:07.500
In other words, any solution
that satisfies the homogeneous

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:12.230
equation and the sum of those
will also satisfy the original

00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:13.910
difference equation.

00:18:13.910 --> 00:18:21.500
So if we have a particular
response that satisfies the

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:27.070
difference equation, then adding
to that any response

00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:32.680
that is a solution to the
homogeneous equation will also

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:36.640
be a solution to the
total equation.

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:41.470
The homogeneous solution, again,
is of the form of a

00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:44.650
linear combination
of exponentials.

00:18:44.650 --> 00:18:48.300
Here, we have the homogeneous
equation.

00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:53.390
As with differential equations,
we can guess or

00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:58.010
impose solutions of the form
A times an exponential.

00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:01.780
When we substitute this into the
homogeneous equation, we

00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:05.830
then end up with the equation
that I've indicated here.

00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:15.580
We recognize again that A, the
amplitude, and z^n, this

00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:19.310
exponential factor,
cancel out.

00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:27.000
And so this equation is
satisfied for any values of z

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.310
that satisfy this equation.

00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:34.310
And there are N roots,
z_1 through z_N.

00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:38.830
And so finally, the form for the
homogeneous solution is a

00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:44.240
linear combination of capital N
exponentials, where capital

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:46.930
N is the order of
the equation.

00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:49.400
With each of those exponentials,
the amplitude

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:53.220
factor is undetermined and needs
to be determined in some

00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:58.630
way through the imposition of
appropriate initial conditions

00:19:58.630 --> 00:19:59.880
or boundary conditions.

00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:07.370
So the general form then for the
solution to the difference

00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:13.590
equation is a sum of
exponentials plus any

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:15.830
particular solution.

00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:20.730
It's through auxiliary
conditions that we determine

00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:23.150
these coefficients.

00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:28.420
We have N undetermined
coefficients and, so we

00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:31.850
require N auxiliary
conditions.

00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:37.520
For example, some set of values
of the output at N

00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:41.210
distinct instance of time.

00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:44.200
Now this was the same as with
differential equations.

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:46.640
In the case of differential
equations, we talked about

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:50.510
specifying the value of the
output and its derivatives.

00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:53.270
And there, we indicated
that for

00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:56.890
linearity, what we required--

00:20:56.890 --> 00:21:00.740
for linearity, what we required
is that the auxiliary

00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:02.580
conditions be 0.

00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:05.830
And the same thing applies
here for the same reason.

00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:09.350
Namely, if the system is to be
linear, then the response, if

00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:13.440
there's no input, must
be equal to 0.

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:19.200
In addition, what we may want
to impose on the system is

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:22.290
that it be causal, and
in addition to linear

00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:28.320
time-invariant, and what that
requires, again, is that the

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:32.220
auxiliary conditions be
consistent with initial rest,

00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:37.690
namely, that if the input is 0
prior to some time, then the

00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:42.680
output is 0 prior to
the same time.

00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:47.240
So we've seen a very direct
parallel so far between

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:52.210
differential equations and
difference equations.

00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:55.930
In fact, one difference between
them that, in some

00:21:55.930 --> 00:22:00.140
sense, makes difference
equations easier to deal with

00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:04.000
in some situations, is that in
contrast to a differential

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.980
equation, a difference equation,
if we assume

00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:13.580
causality, in fact is an
explicit input-output

00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:15.080
relationship for the system.

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:18.670
Now, let me show you
what I mean.

00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:22.130
Let's consider the nth-order
difference equation, as I've

00:22:22.130 --> 00:22:23.490
indicated here.

00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:28.590
And let's assume that we're
imposing causality so that the

00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:33.000
output can only depend on prior
values of the input, and

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.730
therefore, aren't prior
values of the output.

00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:41.450
Well, we can simply rearrange
this equation solving for y[n]

00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:44.680
the leading term, with k = 0.

00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:47.660
Taking all of the other terms
over to the right side of the

00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:54.740
equation, and we then have a
recursive equation, namely, an

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:59.070
equation that expresses the
output in terms of prior

00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:03.850
values of the input, which is
this term, and prior values of

00:23:03.850 --> 00:23:05.640
the output.

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:10.050
And so if, in fact, we have this
equation running, then

00:23:10.050 --> 00:23:13.800
once it started, we know how to
compute the output for the

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:16.740
next time instant.

00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:19.170
Well, how do we get
it started?

00:23:19.170 --> 00:23:22.240
The way we get it started,
of course, is through the

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:26.240
appropriate set of initial
conditions or boundary

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:27.300
conditions.

00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:30.760
And, if for example, we assume
initial rest corresponding to

00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:35.360
a causal linear time-invariant
system, then if the input is 0

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:39.560
up until some time, the output
must be 0 up until that time.

00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:43.390
And that, in essence, helps us
get the equation started.

00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:48.150
Well, let's look at this
specifically in the context of

00:23:48.150 --> 00:23:50.160
a first-order difference
equation.

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:55.510
So let's take a first-order
difference equation, as I've

00:23:55.510 --> 00:23:57.560
indicated here.

00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:00.650
And so, we have an equation
that tells us that y[n]

00:24:00.650 --> 00:24:03.920
- ay[n-1]

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:06.750
= x[n].

00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:10.970
Now, if we want this to
correspond to a causal linear

00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:16.780
time-invariant system, we impose
initial rest on it.

00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:21.550
We can rewrite the first-order
difference equation by taking

00:24:21.550 --> 00:24:24.280
the term involving y[n-1]

00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:25.945
over two the right hand
side of the equation.

00:24:28.450 --> 00:24:33.560
Now, this gives us a recursive
equation that expresses the

00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:38.500
output in terms of the input and
past values of the output.

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:43.610
And since we've imposed
causality, and if we're

00:24:43.610 --> 00:24:46.820
talking about a linear
time-invariant system, we can

00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:50.350
now inquire as to what the
impulse response is.

00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:53.120
And we know, of course, the
impulse response tells us

00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:56.910
everything that we need to
know about the system.

00:24:56.910 --> 00:25:02.990
So let's choose an input,
which is an impulse.

00:25:02.990 --> 00:25:07.070
So the impulse response
is delta[n]

00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:09.040
corresponding to the x[n]

00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:13.490
up here, plus a delta of--

00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:15.880
this should be h[n-1].

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:17.970
And let me just correct that.

00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:20.640
This is h[n-1].

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:24.270
So we have the impulse
response as delta[n]

00:25:24.270 --> 00:25:25.520
plus a times h[n-1].

00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:33.235
Now, from initial rest, we know
that since the input,

00:25:33.235 --> 00:25:37.620
namely an impulse, is 0 for
n less than 0, the impulse

00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:42.410
response is likewise 0
for n less than 0.

00:25:42.410 --> 00:25:45.620
And now, let's work
out what h[0]

00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:46.870
is.

00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:52.900
Well, h of 0, with n
= 0, is delta[0]

00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:55.940
plus a times h[n-1].

00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:56.950
h[n-1]

00:25:56.950 --> 00:25:58.010
is 0.

00:25:58.010 --> 00:25:59.600
And so, h[0]

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:01.440
is equal to 1.

00:26:05.490 --> 00:26:09.030
Now that we have h[0], we
can figure out h[1]

00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:12.340
by running this recursive
equation.

00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:14.640
So h[1]

00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:21.360
is delta[1], which is 0, plus
a times h[0], which we just

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:22.820
figured out is 1.

00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:24.410
So, h[1]

00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:26.120
is equal to a.

00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:29.380
And if we carry this through,
we'll have h[2]

00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:34.180
equal to a^2, and this
will continue on.

00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:37.660
And in fact, what we can
recognize by looking at this

00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:41.860
and how we would expect these
terms to build, we would see

00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:46.120
that the impulse response, h[n],
in fact, is of the form

00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:50.630
a^n times u[n].

00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:56.080
And we also can recognize then
that this corresponds to a

00:26:56.080 --> 00:27:02.890
stable system, if and only if
the impulse response, which is

00:27:02.890 --> 00:27:05.640
what we just figured out, if
and only if the impulse

00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:08.150
response is absolutely
summable.

00:27:08.150 --> 00:27:12.820
And what that will require is
that the magnitude of a be

00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:14.070
less than 1.

00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:21.110
Now, we imposed causality,
linearity, and

00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:25.750
time-invariance, and generated
a solution recursively.

00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:29.590
And now, of course, if we want
to generate the more general

00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:33.880
set of solutions to this
difference equation, we can do

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:38.650
that by adding all of the
homogeneous solutions, namely,

00:27:38.650 --> 00:27:42.860
all the solutions that satisfy
the homogeneous equation.

00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:46.230
So here, we have the
causal linear

00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:49.330
time-invariant impulse response.

00:27:49.330 --> 00:27:55.220
In fact, with an impulse input,
all of the possible

00:27:55.220 --> 00:28:00.380
solutions are that impulse
response plus

00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:02.500
the homogeneous solutions.

00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:06.620
The homogeneous solution is the
solution that satisfies

00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:09.660
the homogeneous equation.

00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:14.960
That will, in general, be of the
form an amplitude factor

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:19.950
times an exponential factor, and
if we substitute this into

00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:24.610
this equation, then we see that
the homogeneous equation

00:28:24.610 --> 00:28:30.480
is satisfied for any values of
a and any values of z that

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:33.780
satisfy this equation.

00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:36.180
Again, as we did with
differential equations, the

00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:39.960
factor A cancels out.

00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:43.870
And also, in fact, I can
cancel out a z^n

00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:48.100
there and a z^n here.

00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:52.420
And so what we're left with is a
statement that tells us then

00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:58.890
that the homogeneous solution is
of the form a(z^n), for any

00:28:58.890 --> 00:29:05.180
value of A and any value of z
that satisfies this equation.

00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:10.200
And that value of z, in
particular, is z equal to a.

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:14.620
So the homogeneous solution
then is any exponential of

00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:17.080
this form with any
amplitude factor.

00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:20.670
And so, the family of solutions,
with an impulse

00:29:20.670 --> 00:29:25.800
input is the solution
corresponding to the system

00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:29.810
being causal, linear, and
time-invariant, plus the

00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:32.010
homogeneous term.

00:29:32.010 --> 00:29:36.950
If we impose causality,
linearity, and time-invariance

00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:41.430
on the system, then of course,
that additional exponential

00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:43.170
factor will be 0.

00:29:43.170 --> 00:29:45.400
In other words, A
is equal to 0.

00:29:48.970 --> 00:29:54.450
Now, we've seen the differential
equations and

00:29:54.450 --> 00:29:59.880
difference equations in terms
of the fact that there are

00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:04.040
families of solutions, and in
order to get causality,

00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:07.350
linearity, and time-invariance
requires imposing a particular

00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:10.930
set of initial conditions,
namely, imposing initial rest

00:30:10.930 --> 00:30:12.480
on the system.

00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:17.310
Let's now look at the difference
equation and then

00:30:17.310 --> 00:30:20.540
later, the differential
equation, interpreted in block

00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:23.190
diagram terms.

00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:27.790
Now, the difference equation,
as I just simply repeated

00:30:27.790 --> 00:30:30.780
here, is y[n]

00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:31.690
= x[n]

00:30:31.690 --> 00:30:37.360
+ ay[n-1], where I've taken the
delayed term over to the

00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:39.440
right hand side of
the equation.

00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:42.200
So, in effect, what
I'm imposing on

00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:44.460
this system is causality.

00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:47.990
I'm assuming that if I know the
past history of the input

00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:52.190
and the output, I can determine
the next value of

00:30:52.190 --> 00:30:53.860
the output.

00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:58.600
Well, we can, in fact, draw a
block diagram that represents

00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:00.130
that equation.

00:31:00.130 --> 00:31:03.140
The equations says,
we take x[n]

00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:07.890
for any given value of n, say
n0, whatever value we're

00:31:07.890 --> 00:31:09.980
computing the output for.

00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:15.850
We take the input at that time,
and add to it the factor

00:31:15.850 --> 00:31:21.390
a times the output value that
we calculated last time.

00:31:21.390 --> 00:31:27.880
So if we have x[n], which is
our input, and if we have

00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:34.160
y[n], which is our output, we,
in fact, can get y of n by

00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:41.290
taking the last value of y[n],
indicated here by putting y[n]

00:31:41.290 --> 00:31:52.070
through a delay, multiplying
that by the factor a, and then

00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:59.930
adding that result
to the input.

00:31:59.930 --> 00:32:05.430
And the result of doing
that is y[n].

00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:09.750
So the way this block diagram
might be interpreted, for

00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:16.720
example, as an algorithm is to
say that we take x[n], add to

00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:20.680
it a times the previous
value the output.

00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:24.160
That sum gives us the current
value of the output, which we

00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:29.440
then put out of the system,
and also put into a delay

00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:33.630
element, or basically, into a
storage register, to use on

00:32:33.630 --> 00:32:35.980
the next iteration
or recursion.

00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:37.580
Now, how do we get
this started?

00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:40.680
Well, we know that the
difference equation requires

00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:42.500
initial conditions.

00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:47.560
And, in fact, the initial
conditions correspond to what

00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:52.210
we store in the delay register
when this block diagram or

00:32:52.210 --> 00:32:55.300
equation initially starts up.

00:32:55.300 --> 00:33:01.380
OK Now, let's look at this for
the case of difference

00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:03.275
equations more generally.

00:33:06.650 --> 00:33:13.360
So, what we've said is that we
can calculate the output by

00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:18.460
having previous values of the
input, previous values of the

00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:22.270
output, and forming the
appropriate linear

00:33:22.270 --> 00:33:23.850
combination.

00:33:23.850 --> 00:33:27.550
So let's just build up the more
general block diagram

00:33:27.550 --> 00:33:28.960
that would correspond to this.

00:33:31.870 --> 00:33:35.900
And what it says is that we want
to have a mechanism for

00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:40.130
storing past values of the
input, and a mechanism for

00:33:40.130 --> 00:33:41.930
storing past values
of the output.

00:33:41.930 --> 00:33:47.400
And I've indicated that on
this figure, so far, by a

00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:55.610
chain of delay elements,
indicating that what the

00:33:55.610 --> 00:34:02.090
output of each delay is, is the
input delayed by one time

00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:05.050
instant or interval.

00:34:05.050 --> 00:34:09.560
And so what we see down this
chain of delays are delayed

00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:13.010
replications of the input.

00:34:13.010 --> 00:34:19.159
And what we see on the other
chain is delayed replications

00:34:19.159 --> 00:34:20.409
of the output.

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:26.139
Now, the difference equation
says that we want to take

00:34:26.139 --> 00:34:31.150
these, and multiply them by the
appropriate coefficients,

00:34:31.150 --> 00:34:33.909
the coefficients in the
difference equation, and so,

00:34:33.909 --> 00:34:37.690
we can do that as I've
indicated here.

00:34:37.690 --> 00:34:42.880
So now, we have these delay
elements, each multiplied by

00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:46.090
the appropriate coefficients
on the input, and by

00:34:46.090 --> 00:34:50.139
appropriate coefficients
on the output.

00:34:50.139 --> 00:34:56.300
Those are then summed together,
and so we now will

00:34:56.300 --> 00:35:00.330
sum these and will sum these.

00:35:00.330 --> 00:35:03.990
After we've summed these, we
want to add those together.

00:35:03.990 --> 00:35:07.200
And there's a factor of
1 / a_0 that comes in.

00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:11.300
And so that then generates
our output.

00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:16.690
And so this, in fact, then
represents a block diagram,

00:35:16.690 --> 00:35:20.370
which is a general block diagram
for implementing or

00:35:20.370 --> 00:35:22.670
representing a linear
constant-coefficient

00:35:22.670 --> 00:35:25.060
difference equation.

00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:28.190
Now, if you think about what
it means in terms of, let's

00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:31.530
say, a computer algorithm or a
piece of hardware, in fact,

00:35:31.530 --> 00:35:34.670
this block diagram is a recipe
or algorithm for doing the

00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:36.410
implementation.

00:35:36.410 --> 00:35:41.680
But it's important to recognize,
even at this point,

00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:45.980
that it's only one of many
possible algorithms or

00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:48.990
implementations for this
difference equation.

00:35:48.990 --> 00:35:57.280
Just for example, I can consider
that equation for

00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:59.320
that block diagram.

00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:03.290
And here, I've re-drawn it.

00:36:03.290 --> 00:36:05.630
So here, are once again.

00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:09.140
I have the same block diagram
that we just saw.

00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:13.810
And I can recognize, for
example, that this, in

00:36:13.810 --> 00:36:19.620
essence, corresponds to two
linear time-invariant systems

00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:22.180
in cascade.

00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:26.540
Now, that assumes, of course,
that my initial conditions are

00:36:26.540 --> 00:36:30.020
such that the system is,
in fact, linear.

00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:33.480
And that, in turn, requires that
we're assuming initial

00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:35.300
rests, namely, before
the input does

00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:37.880
anything other than 0.

00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:41.030
There are just 0 values stored
in the registers.

00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:43.710
But assuming that it corresponds
to a linear

00:36:43.710 --> 00:36:48.640
time-invariant system, this
is a cascade of two linear

00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:50.540
time-invariant invriant
systems.

00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:52.990
We know that two linear
time-invariant systems can be

00:36:52.990 --> 00:36:55.160
cascaded in either order.

00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:59.090
So, in particular, I can
consider breaking this cascade

00:36:59.090 --> 00:37:03.820
here, and moving this block
over to the other side.

00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:05.520
And so let's just do that.

00:37:08.610 --> 00:37:16.160
And when I do, I then have this
combination of systems,

00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:19.370
and, of course, you can ask
what advantage there is to

00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:24.570
doing that, and the advantage
arises because of the fact

00:37:24.570 --> 00:37:31.990
that in this form, exactly what
is stored in these delays

00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:35.120
is also stored in these
delay registers.

00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:38.270
In other words, it's this
intermediate variable--

00:37:38.270 --> 00:37:39.500
whatever it is--

00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:42.850
down this chain of the delays
and down this chain of delays,

00:37:42.850 --> 00:37:47.150
and so, in fact, I can collapse
those delays into a

00:37:47.150 --> 00:37:49.000
single chain of delays.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:53.790
And the network that I'm left
with is the network that I

00:37:53.790 --> 00:37:57.930
indicate on this view graph,
where what I've done is to

00:37:57.930 --> 00:38:01.980
simply collapse that double
chain of delays into a single

00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:04.580
change of delays.

00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:10.180
Now, one can ask, well, what's
the advantage to doing that?

00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:13.020
And one advantage, simply
stated, is that when you think

00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:16.160
in terms of an implementation
of a difference equation, a

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:21.340
delay corresponds to a storage
register, a memory location,

00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:24.980
and by simply using the fact
that we can interchange the

00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:27.200
order in which linear
time-invariant systems are

00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:30.030
cascaded, we can reduce
the amount of memory

00:38:30.030 --> 00:38:31.280
by a factor of 2.

00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:40.570
Now, an essentially similar
procedure can also be used for

00:38:40.570 --> 00:38:44.910
differential equations, in terms
of implementation using

00:38:44.910 --> 00:38:47.590
block diagrams or the
interpretation of

00:38:47.590 --> 00:38:50.350
implementations using
block diagrams.

00:38:50.350 --> 00:38:52.380
And let me first do that--

00:38:52.380 --> 00:38:56.840
rather than in general-- let me
first do it in the context

00:38:56.840 --> 00:39:00.870
of a specific example.

00:39:00.870 --> 00:39:06.830
So let's consider a linear
constant-coefficient

00:39:06.830 --> 00:39:10.790
differential equation, as I've
indicated here, and I have

00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:13.930
terms on the left side and
terms on the right side.

00:39:13.930 --> 00:39:19.870
And with the differential
equation, let's consider

00:39:19.870 --> 00:39:22.800
taking all the terms over
to the right side of the

00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:26.030
equation, except
for the highest

00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:28.950
derivative in the output.

00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:33.250
Next, we integrate both sides
of the equation so that when

00:39:33.250 --> 00:39:35.540
we're done, we end up with
on the left side of the

00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:37.480
equation with y(t).

00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:40.480
On the right side of the
equation with the appropriate

00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:42.700
number of integrations.

00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:46.170
And so the integral equation
that we'll get for this

00:39:46.170 --> 00:39:52.410
example y(t), the output, is
x(t) plus b, the scale factor

00:39:52.410 --> 00:39:56.370
times the integral of the input,
and minus a, that scale

00:39:56.370 --> 00:39:59.480
factor, times the integral
of the output.

00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:05.600
So to form the output in the
block diagram terms, we form a

00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:09.140
linear combination of the input,
a scaled integral of

00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:12.970
the input, and a scaled integral
of the output, all of

00:40:12.970 --> 00:40:14.820
that added together.

00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:20.540
So we need, in addition to
the input, we need the

00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:22.070
integral of the input.

00:40:22.070 --> 00:40:25.250
And so this box indicates
an integrator.

00:40:25.250 --> 00:40:28.260
In addition to the output,
we need the

00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:30.670
integral of the output.

00:40:30.670 --> 00:40:38.490
And now, to form y(t), we
multiply the integrated input

00:40:38.490 --> 00:40:41.540
by the scale factor, b.

00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:49.860
And add that to x(t), and we
take the integrated output,

00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:57.330
multiply it by -a, and add
to that the result of the

00:40:57.330 --> 00:41:00.530
previous addition, and according
to the integral

00:41:00.530 --> 00:41:05.180
equation, then that
forms the output.

00:41:05.180 --> 00:41:09.580
So just as we did with the
difference equation, we've

00:41:09.580 --> 00:41:12.330
converted the differential
equation to an integral

00:41:12.330 --> 00:41:17.200
equation, and we have a block
diagram form very similar to

00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:20.100
what we had in the case of
the difference equation.

00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:24.160
Now, the initial conditions,
of course, are tied up in,

00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:27.430
again, how these integrators
are initialized.

00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:30.980
Assuming that we impose initial
rest on the system, we

00:41:30.980 --> 00:41:33.710
can think of the overall
system as a linear

00:41:33.710 --> 00:41:37.740
time-invariant system, and it's
a cascade of one linear

00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:40.470
time-invariant system
with a second.

00:41:40.470 --> 00:41:47.190
So we can, in fact, break
this, and consider

00:41:47.190 --> 00:41:49.620
interchanging the order
in which these

00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:51.520
two systems are cascaded.

00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:54.580
And so I've indicated
that down below.

00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:58.840
Here, I've simply taken
the top block diagram,

00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:01.920
interchanged the order
in which the

00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:05.590
two systems are cascaded.

00:42:05.590 --> 00:42:09.490
And here, again, we can ask what
the advantages to this,

00:42:09.490 --> 00:42:12.090
as opposed to the
previous one.

00:42:12.090 --> 00:42:14.830
And what you can see, just as
we saw with the difference

00:42:14.830 --> 00:42:18.790
equation, is that now,
the integrators--

00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:19.780
both integrators--

00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:21.730
are integrating the
same thing.

00:42:21.730 --> 00:42:27.170
In particular, the input to this
integrator and the input

00:42:27.170 --> 00:42:30.210
to this integrator
are identical.

00:42:30.210 --> 00:42:34.660
So in fact, rather than using
this one, we can simply tap

00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:36.970
off from here.

00:42:36.970 --> 00:42:40.660
We can, in fact, remove this
integrator, break this

00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:45.610
connection, and tap
in at this point.

00:42:45.610 --> 00:42:49.910
And so what we've done then, by
interchanging the order in

00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:53.420
which the systems are cascaded,
is reduced the

00:42:53.420 --> 00:42:56.730
implementation to the
implementation with a single

00:42:56.730 --> 00:42:58.060
integrator.

00:42:58.060 --> 00:43:01.830
Very much similar to what we
talked about in the case of

00:43:01.830 --> 00:43:03.630
the difference equation.

00:43:03.630 --> 00:43:07.600
Now, let's just, again, with the
integral equation or the

00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:13.270
differential equation, look at
this somewhat more generally.

00:43:13.270 --> 00:43:17.360
Again, if we take the
differential equation, the

00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:20.480
general differential equation,
integrate it a sufficient

00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:23.740
number of times to convert it
to an integral equation.

00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:28.320
We would then have this
cascade of systems.

00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:33.000
And again, if we assume initial
rest, so that these

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:36.520
are both linear time-invariant
systems, we can interchange

00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:38.610
the order in which
they're cascaded.

00:43:38.610 --> 00:43:45.990
Namely, take the second system,
and move it to precede

00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:48.220
the first system.

00:43:48.220 --> 00:43:51.890
And then what we recognize is
that the input to this chain

00:43:51.890 --> 00:43:54.530
of integrators and this
chain of integrators

00:43:54.530 --> 00:43:56.220
is exactly the same.

00:43:56.220 --> 00:44:00.320
And so, in fact we can collapse
these together using

00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:02.310
only one chain of integrators.

00:44:02.310 --> 00:44:07.890
And the system that we're left
with then is a system that

00:44:07.890 --> 00:44:09.730
looks as I've indicated here.

00:44:09.730 --> 00:44:14.890
So we have now just a single
chains of integrators instead

00:44:14.890 --> 00:44:18.330
of the two sets of
integrators.

00:44:18.330 --> 00:44:21.670
So we've seen that the situation
is very similar here

00:44:21.670 --> 00:44:24.510
as it was in the case of the
difference equation.

00:44:24.510 --> 00:44:26.900
Again, why do we want
to cut the number of

00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:28.310
integrators in half?

00:44:28.310 --> 00:44:32.140
Well, one reason is because
integrators, in effect,

00:44:32.140 --> 00:44:33.710
represent hardware.

00:44:33.710 --> 00:44:38.155
And if we have half as many
integrators, then we're using

00:44:38.155 --> 00:44:39.410
half as much hardware.

00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:44.440
Well, let me just conclude by

00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:47.550
summarizing a number of points.

00:44:47.550 --> 00:44:50.340
I indicated at the beginning
that linear

00:44:50.340 --> 00:44:52.690
constant-coefficient
differential equations and

00:44:52.690 --> 00:44:57.060
difference equations will play
an important role as linear

00:44:57.060 --> 00:45:01.490
time-invariant systems
throughout this course and

00:45:01.490 --> 00:45:04.160
throughout this set
of lectures.

00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:09.210
I also stressed the fact that
differential or difference

00:45:09.210 --> 00:45:13.990
equations, by themselves, are
not a complete specification

00:45:13.990 --> 00:45:18.190
of the system because of the
fact that we can add to any

00:45:18.190 --> 00:45:21.970
solution a homogeneous
solution.

00:45:21.970 --> 00:45:26.080
How do we specify the
appropriate initial conditions

00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:28.270
to ensure--

00:45:28.270 --> 00:45:30.260
how do we specify the
appropriate initial conditions

00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:34.250
to ensure that the system is
linear and time-invariant?

00:45:34.250 --> 00:45:39.110
Well, the auxiliary information,
namely, the

00:45:39.110 --> 00:45:45.100
initial conditions associated
with the system being causal,

00:45:45.100 --> 00:45:47.790
linear, and time-invariant
are the

00:45:47.790 --> 00:45:50.630
conditions of initial rest.

00:45:50.630 --> 00:45:54.130
And, in fact, for most of the
course, what we'll be

00:45:54.130 --> 00:45:57.200
interested in are systems that
are in fact, causal, linear,

00:45:57.200 --> 00:45:58.420
and time-invariant.

00:45:58.420 --> 00:46:01.150
And so we will, in fact, be
assuming initial rest

00:46:01.150 --> 00:46:03.640
conditions.

00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:09.670
Now, as I also indicated,
there are a variety of

00:46:09.670 --> 00:46:12.580
efficient procedures for solving
differential and

00:46:12.580 --> 00:46:15.560
difference equations that we
haven't yet addressed.

00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:18.990
And beginning with the next
set of lectures, we'll be

00:46:18.990 --> 00:46:22.510
talking about the Fourier
Transform and much later in

00:46:22.510 --> 00:46:26.470
the course, what's referred to
as the Laplace Transform for

00:46:26.470 --> 00:46:30.070
continuous time and the
Z-transform for discrete time.

00:46:30.070 --> 00:46:34.030
And what we'll see is that with
the Fourier Transform and

00:46:34.030 --> 00:46:37.300
later with the Laplace and
Z-transform, we'll have a

00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:42.480
number of efficient and very
useful ways of generating the

00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:48.000
solution for differential and
difference equations under the

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.705
assumption that the system
is causal, linear, and

00:46:50.705 --> 00:46:52.510
time-invariant.

00:46:52.510 --> 00:46:56.020
Also, we'll see in addition
to the block diagram

00:46:56.020 --> 00:46:58.510
implementations of these systems
that we've talked

00:46:58.510 --> 00:47:04.170
about so far, we'll see a
number of other useful

00:47:04.170 --> 00:47:07.880
implementations that exploit
a variety of properties

00:47:07.880 --> 00:47:10.870
associated with Fourier and
Laplace Transforms.

00:47:10.870 --> 00:47:12.120
Thank you.
