00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.190
PROFESSOR: We concluded the
last lecture with the

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:59.960
statement of the sampling
theorem.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.090
And just as a quick reminder,
the sampling theorem said that

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:10.170
if we have a continuous-time
signal and we have equally

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.460
spaced samples of that signal,
sampled at a sampling period,

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.860
which I indicate is capital
T and if x of t is

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.810
band-limited-- in other words,
the Fourier transform is zero

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.750
outside some band where omega
sub m is the highest

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:35.480
frequency-- then under the
condition that the sampling

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.010
frequency, which is 2 pi divided
by the period, is

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.770
greater than twice the
highest frequency.

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.520
The original signal is uniquely
recoverable from the

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.350
set of samples.

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.990
And the sampling theorem
essentially was derived by

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.100
observing or using the notion
that sampling could be done by

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.830
multiplication or modulation
with an impulse train.

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.900
And the sampling theorem
developed by examining the

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.060
consequence of the modulation
property in the context of the

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.940
Fourier transform.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:19.370
In particular, if we have
our signal x of t and if

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:25.200
multiplied by an impulse train
to give us a sampled signal--

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.570
another impulse train whose
values or areas are samples of

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:36.220
the original time function, as
I indicate here-- then in

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.120
fact, if we examine this
equation or equivalently,

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.770
bringing x of t inside this sum,
if we examine either of

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.200
these equations in the frequency
domain, the Fourier

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:57.210
transform of x of p of t is the
convolution of the Fourier

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.410
transform of the original
signal and the Fourier

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.600
transform of the
impulse train.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.110
Now the impulse train is
a periodic signal.

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.850
It's Fourier transform.

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.950
Therefore, as we talked about
with Fourier transforms is

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.880
itself an impulse train.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.860
And when we do this convolution,
then using the

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.020
fact that the Fourier transform,
the impulse train

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.480
is an impulse train.

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.100
The result of this convolution,
then tells us

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:33.540
that the Fourier transform of
the sample signal or the

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.610
impulse train, which represents
the samples, is a

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:43.220
sum of frequency-shifted
replications of the Fourier

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.030
transform of the original
signal.

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.040
So mathematically, that's
the relationship.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.760
It essentially says that after
sampling or modulation with an

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.210
impulse train, the resulting
spectrum is the original

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:02.510
spectrum added to itself,
shifted by integer multiples

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.550
of the sampling frequency.

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:06.740
Well, let's see that
as we did last

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.280
time in terms of pictures.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:14.240
And again, to remind you of the
basic picture involved, if

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.980
we have an original signal with
a spectrum as I indicated

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.600
here-- where it's band-limited
with the highest frequency

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:28.030
omega sub m-- and if the time
function is sampled so that in

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.630
the frequency domain we convolve
this spectrum with

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:38.990
the spectrum shown below, which
is the spectrum of the

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:45.260
impulse train, the convolution
of these two is then the

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:51.600
Fourier transform or spectrum
of the sample time function.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.750
And so that's what we
end up with here.

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.480
And then as you recall, to
recover the original time

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:03.790
function from this-- as long as
these individual triangles

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:09.890
don't overlap--to recover it
just simply involves passing

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:13.820
the impulse train through a
low-pass filter, in effect

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:18.800
extracting just one of
these replications of

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.430
the original spectrum.

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:29.880
So the overall system then for
doing the sampling and then

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.940
the reconstruction of the
original signal from the

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:37.600
samples, consists of multiplying
the original time

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.070
function by an impulse train.

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:45.990
And that gives us then
the sampled signal.

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:51.380
The Fourier transform I show
here of the original signal

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:55.520
and after modulation with the
impulse train, the resulting

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:01.510
spectrum that we have is that
replicated around integer

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:04.460
multiples of the sampling
frequency.

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:09.440
And then finally, to recover
the original signal or to

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:14.470
generate a reconstructed signal,
we then multiply this

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:19.100
in the frequency domain by the
frequency response of an ideal

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:20.700
low-pass filter.

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:25.820
And what that accomplishes for
us then is recovering the

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:28.290
original signal.

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:31.560
Now in this picture, an
important point that I raised

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:35.370
last time, relates to the
fact that in doing the

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:39.270
reconstruction--well we've
assumed-- is that in

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:45.840
replicating these individual
versions of the original

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:49.710
signal, those replications
don't overlap and so by

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:52.340
passing this through a low-pass
filter in fact, we

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:54.970
can recover the original
signal.

00:06:54.970 --> 00:07:00.560
Well, what that requires is that
this frequency, omega sub

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:05.420
m, be less than this
frequency.

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:12.310
And this frequency is omega
sub s minus omega sub m.

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:16.850
And so what we require is that
the frequency omega sub m be

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:20.530
less than omega sub s
minus omega sub m.

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:24.600
Or equivalently, what we require
is that the sampling

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:29.450
frequency be greater than twice
the highest frequency in

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:32.190
the original signal.

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:38.360
Now, if in fact that condition
is violated, then we end up

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:40.950
with a very important effect.

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:44.840
And that effect is referred
to as aliasing.

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:52.150
In particular, if we look back
at our original example--we

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:57.010
are here-- we were able to
recover our original spectrum

00:07:57.010 --> 00:07:59.710
by low-pass filtering.

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:05.860
If in fact the sampling
frequency is not high enough

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:10.680
to avoid aliasing, then what
happens in that case is that

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:17.480
the individual replications of
the Fourier transform of the

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:23.210
original signal overlap and what
we end up with is some

00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:24.500
distortion.

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:27.920
As you can see, if we try to
pass this through a low-pass

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:32.650
filter to recover the original
signal, in fact we won't

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:36.070
recover the original signal
since these individual

00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:38.059
replications have overlapped.

00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:42.370
And this is the case where omega
sub s minus omega sub m

00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:44.810
is less than omega sub s.

00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:48.040
In other words, the sampling
frequency is not greater in

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:52.110
this case than twice the
highest frequency.

00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:56.370
So what happens here then is
that in effect, higher

00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:59.880
frequencies get folded down
into lower frequencies.

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:02.390
What would come out of the
low-pass filter is the

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:04.960
reflection of some higher
frequencies into lower

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:06.380
frequencies.

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:10.030
As I suggested a minute
ago, that effect is

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:12.290
referred to as aliasing.

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:15.970
And in order to both understand
that term better

00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:20.540
and to understand in fact the
effect better, it's useful to

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:25.310
examine this a little more
closely for the specific

00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:27.760
example of a sinusoidal
signal.

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:29.500
So let's concentrate on that.

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:36.490
And what we want to look at is
the effect of aliasing when

00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:39.920
our input signal is a
sinusoidal signal.

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:44.750
Now to do that, what I want
to show shortly is a

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:47.690
computer-generated movie
that we've made.

00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:51.650
And let's first walk through a
few frames of it to give you--

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:57.490
first of all, to set up our
notation and to suggest what

00:09:57.490 --> 00:10:00.530
it is that we're trying
to demonstrate.

00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:06.250
Well, what we have is
an input signal-- is

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:07.490
a sinusoidal signal.

00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:12.720
And the spectrum or Fourier
transform of that is an

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:15.840
impulse in the frequency
domain at the

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:18.190
frequency of the sinusoid.

00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:22.380
We then have samples of that and
when we sample that-- and

00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:25.250
for this particular example,
it's sampled at 10 kilohertz--

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:31.980
this spectrum is then replicated
at multiples of the

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:33.640
sampling frequency.

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:36.590
And I haven't shown negative
frequencies here, but the

00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:42.040
contribution due to the negative
frequency is at 10

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:46.620
kilohertz minus the
input sinusoid.

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:51.320
We then carry out a
reconstruction with an ideal

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:52.490
low-pass filter.

00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:55.980
And the ideal low-pass filter
is set at half the sampling

00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:58.450
frequency or 5 kilohertz.

00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:06.410
So what we have then is the
input signal x of t and the

00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:09.840
impulse train x of p of t.

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:15.100
And then the reconstructed
signal is the output from the

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:21.120
low-pass filter which I
denote as x of r of t.

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:26.320
Now as the input frequency x of
t increases, this impulse

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:30.110
moves up in frequency,
but this impulse

00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:32.120
moves down in frequency.

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:35.440
And so let's just look at a
few frames as the input

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:37.190
frequency increases.

00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:43.290
So we have here a case where the
input frequency has moved

00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:46.760
up close to 5 kilohertz.

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:52.260
As we continue further, these
two impulses will cross and

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:56.120
what we'll end up with, as
I indicated, is aliasing.

00:11:56.120 --> 00:12:00.650
So here now is a case where
we have aliasing.

00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:04.710
The replication of the negative
frequency has crossed

00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:08.710
into the passband of the filter
and the reconstructed

00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:13.910
sinusoid will now be the
frequency associated with this

00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:18.980
impulse rather than the
frequency associated with the

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:20.520
original sinusoid.

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:27.240
And to dramatize that even
further, here is the example

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:31.600
where now the input frequency
has moved up close to 10

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:36.840
kilohertz, but what comes out
of the low-pass filter is a

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:38.760
much lower frequency.

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:42.200
And in fact, you can see that
here is the reconstructed

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:46.600
sinusoid, whereas here we
have the input sinusoid.

00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:53.010
Well, now what I'm going to want
to do is demonstrate this

00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:56.910
as I indicated with a
computer-generated movie.

00:12:56.910 --> 00:13:05.380
And what we'll see is the effect
of reconstructing from

00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:10.590
the samples using a low-pass
filter for an input which

00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:12.910
changes in frequency and with a

00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:15.730
sampling rate of 10 kilohertz.

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:19.050
And what we'll see in the first
part of this movie is

00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:23.530
the input x of t and the
reconstructed signal x of r of

00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:27.290
t without explicitly showing
the samples.

00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:30.270
And then, at a later point,
we'll also show this and

00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:33.380
indicate that in fact the
samples of those two are

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:37.580
equal, even though they
themselves are not.

00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:42.260
So at the top, we'll have the
input sinusoid without showing

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:43.840
the samples.

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:48.510
And its Fourier transform is
an impulse in the frequency

00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:50.500
domain as we've indicated.

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:55.670
And if we sample it, that
impulse then gets replicated.

00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:59.700
And so its samples, in
particular, will have a

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:03.500
Fourier transform not only with
an impulse at the input

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:06.595
sinusoidal frequency,
but also at 10

00:14:06.595 --> 00:14:09.260
kilohertz minus that frequency.

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:13.330
Now for the reconstruction, we
passed the samples through an

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:14.690
ideal low-pass filter.

00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:18.620
I picked the cutoff frequency of
the low-pass filter at half

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:21.530
the sampling frequency,
namely 5 kilohertz.

00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:25.810
And here, what we see is that
the output reconstructed

00:14:25.810 --> 00:14:29.540
signal in fact matches in
frequency the input signal.

00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:34.380
Now as we change the input
frequency, the reconstructed

00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:41.010
sinusoid is identical until we
get to an input frequency,

00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:44.480
which exceeds half the
sampling frequency.

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:48.760
At that point we have aliasing
and while the input frequency

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:52.990
is increasing, the output
frequency in fact is

00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:56.920
decreasing because that's what's
inside the passband of

00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:58.960
the filter.

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:01.310
Now let's sweep it back.

00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:04.630
And as the input frequency
decreases, the output

00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:08.440
frequency increases until
there's no aliasing and now

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:11.410
the output reconstructed signal
is equal to the input.

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:18.670
So we've sampled a signal and
then reconstructed the signal

00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:20.240
from the samples.

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:24.740
And keep in mind, that given a
set of samples, there are lots

00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:26.980
of continuous curves
that we can thread

00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:28.640
through the set of samples.

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:32.650
The one that we picked, of
course, is the one consistent

00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:35.900
with the assumption about
the signal bandwidth.

00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:40.130
In particular, we've
reconstructed the signal whose

00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:44.430
spectrum falls within the
passband of the filter.

00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:49.570
Now what I'd like to show is
the same reconstruction and

00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:53.290
input as I showed before, but
now let's look at the samples

00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:57.920
and what we'll see is that when
there's aliasing, even

00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:02.420
though the output-- the
reconstructed signal-- is not

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:04.690
identical to the input.

00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:08.420
In fact it's consistent with
the input samples that is

00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:11.620
sampling the reconstructed
signal.

00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:14.110
It gives a set of samples
identical to the samples of

00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:17.920
the input and it's just that the
interpolation in between

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:21.565
those samples is an
interpolation consistent with

00:16:21.565 --> 00:16:24.690
the assumed bandwidth of
the input based on

00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:25.940
the sampling theorem.

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:31.080
So let's now look at that with
the samples also shown along

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:33.760
with the sinusoid.

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:37.320
So at the top, we have the input
sinusoid together with

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:38.480
its samples.

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:40.890
The bottom trace is the Fourier
transform of the

00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:42.860
sampled waveform.

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:47.260
The middle trace is the
reconstructed sinusoid

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:48.970
together with its samples.

00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:52.200
And notice, of course, that the
samples of the input or

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:55.830
reconstructed signal
are identical.

00:16:55.830 --> 00:17:01.820
And also the input sinusoidal
frequency and the output

00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:04.900
sinusoidal frequency
are identical.

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:09.510
And we now increase the
frequency at the input.

00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:13.150
The reconstructed sinusoid
tracks the input in frequency

00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:16.970
and, of course, the samples
of the two are identical.

00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:20.829
The interpolation in between
the samples is identical

00:17:20.829 --> 00:17:25.200
because of the fact that the
input frequency is still less

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:26.490
than half the sampling
frequency.

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:35.460
And so, as long as the input is
frequency is less than half

00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:38.570
the sampling frequency, not
only will the samples be

00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:42.550
identical, but also the
reconstructed continuous

00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:45.725
waveform will match the
input waveform.

00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:59.880
Now when we get to half the
sampling frequency, we're just

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:01.440
on the verge of aliasing.

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:05.680
This isn't aliasing quite yet,
but any increase in the input

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:09.870
frequency will now generate
aliasing.

00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:13.460
We now have aliasing, the output
frequency is lower than

00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:15.840
the input frequency,
but notice that

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:19.640
the samples are identical.

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:23.410
Now the low-pass filter is
interpolating in between those

00:18:23.410 --> 00:18:27.600
samples with a sinusoid that
falls within the passband of

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:31.260
the low-pass filter, which no
longer matches the frequency

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:34.140
of the input sinusoid.

00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:37.420
But the important point is
that even when we have

00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:42.290
aliasing, the samples of the
reconstructed waveform are

00:18:42.290 --> 00:18:47.290
identical to the samples of
the original waveform.

00:18:47.290 --> 00:18:51.340
And notice that as the input
frequency increases, in fact

00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:55.280
the interpolated output, the
reconstructed output has

00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:58.270
decreased in frequency.

00:18:58.270 --> 00:19:01.895
Now as the input frequency
begins to get closer to 10

00:19:01.895 --> 00:19:07.020
kilohertz-- in fact your eye
tends to also interpolate

00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:12.770
between the samples with a
frequency that is lower than

00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:13.910
the input frequency.

00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:16.800
And that's particularly
evident here.

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:21.050
Notice that the input samples
in fact look like they would

00:19:21.050 --> 00:19:25.310
be associated with a much lower
frequency sinusoid, than

00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:28.630
in fact was the sinusoid
that generated them.

00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:32.010
The lower-frequency sinusoid
in fact corresponds to the

00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:34.070
reconstructed one.

00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:38.650
Now as we sweep back down, the
aliasing eventually disappears

00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:40.450
and the output sinusoid
tracks the

00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:41.760
input sinusoid in frequency.

00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:47.820
So we've seen the effect of
aliasing for sinusoidal

00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:50.170
signals in terms of waveforms.

00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:53.270
Now let's hear how it sounds.

00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:59.760
Now what we have for this
demonstration is an oscillator

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:02.330
and a sampler.

00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:06.460
And the output of the sampler
goes into a low-pass filter.

00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:12.240
So the input from the oscillator
goes into the

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:16.930
sampler and the output of
the sampler goes into

00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:18.840
the low-pass filter.

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:23.600
The sampler frequency
is 10 kilohertz.

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:28.880
And so the low-pass filter has
a cutoff frequency as I

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:32.740
indicate here, of 5 kilohertz.

00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:39.740
And what we'll listen to is the
reconstructed output as

00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:44.280
the oscillator input
frequency varies.

00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:48.850
And recall that what should
happen is that when the

00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:52.340
oscillator input frequency gets
past half the sampling

00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:56.600
frequency, we should
hear aliasing.

00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:58.430
So we'll start the oscillator
at 2 kilohertz.

00:20:58.430 --> 00:20:59.460
[OSCILLATOR SOUND
IN BACKGROUND]

00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:02.420
PROFESSOR: And keep in mind that
what you see on the dial

00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:04.960
is the input frequency,
what you hear

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:06.850
is the output frequency.

00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:09.880
As long as the input frequency
is less than half the sampling

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:13.220
frequency-- in other words, 5
kilohertz -- the reconstructed

00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:17.150
signal sounds identical
to the input.

00:21:17.150 --> 00:21:20.660
Now at 5 kilohertz, we're
right on the verge of

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:24.505
aliasing, and when we increase
the input frequency past 5

00:21:24.505 --> 00:21:27.330
kilohertz, the reconstructed
frequency

00:21:27.330 --> 00:21:29.370
in fact will decrease.

00:21:29.370 --> 00:21:33.740
So as we move, for example, from
5 kilohertz up to let's

00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:36.440
say, 6 kilohertz.

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:41.450
6 kilohertz in fact gets
aliased down to, what?

00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:45.580
It gets aliased down
to 4 kilohertz.

00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:52.190
So 6 kilohertz at the input is
4 kilohertz at the output.

00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:55.630
Now, if we move up even further,
7 kilohertz at the

00:21:55.630 --> 00:22:02.380
input gets aliased down to 3
kilohertz at the output.

00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:07.540
So that, then is an audio
demonstration of aliasing.

00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:12.680
So to summarize, if we sample a
signal and then reconstruct

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:16.020
from the samples using a
low-pass filter, as long as

00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:18.770
the sampling frequency is
greater than twice the highest

00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:22.300
frequency in the signal we
reconstruct exactly.

00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:25.900
If on the other hand, the
sampling frequency is too low,

00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:27.160
less than twice the highest

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:30.310
frequency, then we get aliasing.

00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:34.270
In other words, higher
frequencies get folded or

00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:37.220
reflected down into lower
frequencies as they come

00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:40.430
through the low-pass filter.

00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:44.560
Now, one of the common
applications of the whole

00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:49.880
concept of sampling is the use
of sampling to convert a

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:55.080
continuous-time signal into a
discrete-time signal to carry

00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:59.460
out what's often referred to as
discrete-time processing of

00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:01.690
continuous-time signals.

00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:05.810
And this in fact is something
that we'll be talking about in

00:23:05.810 --> 00:23:07.520
a fair amount of detail,
beginning

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:09.290
with the next lecture.

00:23:09.290 --> 00:23:14.270
But let me indicate that for
that kind of processing,

00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:17.710
essentially what happens, is
that we begin with the

00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:21.970
continuous-time signal and
convert it to a discrete-time

00:23:21.970 --> 00:23:25.930
signal, carry out the
discrete-time processing, and

00:23:25.930 --> 00:23:29.200
then convert back to
continuous-time.

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:33.770
And the conversion from a
continuous-time signal to a

00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:39.240
discrete-time signal in fact,
is done by exploiting

00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:44.160
sampling, specifically by
sampling the continuous-time

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:49.210
signal with an impulse train
and then converting the

00:23:49.210 --> 00:23:54.600
impulse train into a sequence
in a matter that I'll talk

00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:57.790
about in more detail
next time.

00:23:57.790 --> 00:24:01.800
Now in doing that-- of course,
as you can imagine-- it's

00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:05.480
important since we want an
accurate representation of the

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:08.850
original continuous-time signal,
to choose the sampling

00:24:08.850 --> 00:24:12.800
frequency, to very carefully
avoid aliasing.

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:16.560
And so in fact, in that context
and in many other

00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:19.890
contexts, aliasing is something
that we're very

00:24:19.890 --> 00:24:21.750
eager to avoid.

00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:25.880
However, it's also important
to understand that aliasing

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:27.410
isn't all bad.

00:24:27.410 --> 00:24:30.560
And there are some very specific
contexts in which

00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:36.230
aliasing is very useful and
very heavily exploited.

00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:42.280
One example of a very useful
context of aliasing is when

00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:45.820
you want to look at things that
happen at frequencies

00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:48.550
that you can't look at, for
one reason or another.

00:24:48.550 --> 00:24:51.800
And sampling and aliasing is
used to map those into lower

00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:52.950
frequencies.

00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:56.930
One very common example of
that is the use of the

00:24:56.930 --> 00:25:03.340
stroboscope which was invented
by Dr. Harold Edgerton at MIT.

00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:07.810
And sometime earlier, in fact
we had the opportunity to

00:25:07.810 --> 00:25:12.180
visit Dr. Edgerton's laboratory
at MIT and see some

00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:13.590
examples of this.

00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:17.535
So I'd like to-- as a conclusion
to this lecture--

00:25:17.535 --> 00:25:22.195
take you on a visit to the
strobe lab at MIT.

00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:28.200
In the lecture-- in discussing
aliasing-- we've stressed the

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:31.380
fact that in most situations,
it's something that

00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:33.950
we'd like to avoid.

00:25:33.950 --> 00:25:38.340
However, right now we're at MIT,
in Strobe Alley as it's

00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:42.860
called, on the way to visit
the laboratory of my MIT

00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:45.850
colleague, Professor Harold
Edgerton, where in fact

00:25:45.850 --> 00:25:49.430
aliasing is an everyday
occurrence.

00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:54.970
Basically, the idea is the
following-- that if in fact

00:25:54.970 --> 00:25:58.600
you want to make measurements
at frequencies that, for one

00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:03.480
reason or another, you can't
measure, then sampling and,

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:07.140
consequently, aliasing can
be used to bring those

00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:09.770
frequencies down into
a frequency range

00:26:09.770 --> 00:26:12.200
that you can measure.

00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:18.230
Well, Professor Edgerton alias
Doc Edgerton invented the

00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:20.700
stroboscope for exactly
that reason.

00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:23.460
And, kind of, the idea
is the following.

00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:26.720
The eye, essentially, is a
low-pass filter and so there

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:31.590
are things that happen at
frequencies above which your

00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:33.650
eye can track.

00:26:33.650 --> 00:26:39.800
And by sampling with light
pulses, sampling in time, what

00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:44.430
in effect you're able to do is
sample in such a way that

00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:48.810
higher frequencies get aliased
down to lower frequencies so

00:26:48.810 --> 00:26:51.660
that, in fact, your eye
can track them.

00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:57.390
So let's take a look inside
the lab and in fact see an

00:26:57.390 --> 00:27:00.600
illustration of this strobe
and some of its effects.

00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:10.260
Let me introduce you to my MIT
colleague, Doc Edgerton.

00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:13.760
Also by the way, this is a great
place for kids of all

00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:17.710
ages and so my daughter,
Justine, insisted on coming

00:27:17.710 --> 00:27:19.580
along to also help out.

00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:22.600
Doc, maybe we could begin with
you just saying a little bit

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:26.160
about what the strobe is and
what some of the history is?

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:28.950
DR. HAROLD EDGERTON: Sure, it's
a very simple application

00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:30.390
of intermittent light.

00:27:30.390 --> 00:27:36.960
And this is a xenon lamp that
flashes in a controlled rate

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:39.840
depending on this knob which
Justine's going to turn.

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:43.740
And we're going to look at
a motor that's driving an

00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:46.050
unbalanced weight to set
up some [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:46.050 --> 00:27:48.420
oscillations in the spring.

00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:50.456
I'll turn on the motor.

00:27:50.456 --> 00:27:51.932
I'll turn on the strobe.

00:27:51.932 --> 00:27:53.182
[STROBOSCOPE SOUND
IN BACKGROUND]

00:28:10.136 --> 00:28:12.838
DR. HAROLD EDGERTON: Just
get the right range.

00:28:12.838 --> 00:28:15.295
All right, Justine, turn that
now, until it stops.

00:28:17.905 --> 00:28:20.710
See that, Justine, the frequency
is that the light,

00:28:20.710 --> 00:28:22.890
which corresponds to the
frequency of the motor.

00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:25.820
And it's a little less or a
little more, when you lean to

00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:27.380
go forward to backwards.

00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:29.480
PROFESSOR: Doc, maybe
we could turn this

00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:30.560
strobe off for minute.

00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:38.230
And let me point out, by the
way, the fact that when we're

00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:40.770
looking at this without the
strobe on, what we're seeing

00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:43.560
essentially are frequencies
that our eye can't track.

00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:48.170
So we can't see the motor
turning and we can't really

00:28:48.170 --> 00:28:49.930
see other than with a blur.

00:28:49.930 --> 00:28:52.190
We can't see the movement
of the spring.

00:28:52.190 --> 00:28:54.770
And so I guess, your point is
that when we put the strobe

00:28:54.770 --> 00:28:59.070
on, we're essentially
sampling this.

00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:03.950
And now we brought this down to
a frequency that our eye is

00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:06.080
able to track.

00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:13.210
In fact, I guess if we turn the
incandescent light off,

00:29:13.210 --> 00:29:18.600
what we'll be able to really
bring out are the alias

00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:19.220
frequencies.

00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:23.010
So now, what we're looking
at in fact are the alias

00:29:23.010 --> 00:29:24.430
frequencies.

00:29:24.430 --> 00:29:26.430
The spring, of course, is moving
a lot faster than we

00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:27.640
see it, isn't that right?

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:29.640
DR. HAROLD EDGERTON:
Yes, it's going

00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:32.781
approximately 30 times a second.

00:29:32.781 --> 00:29:36.150
The motor is going far from
30 times a second.

00:29:36.150 --> 00:29:39.150
I will speed this up while I hit
the next mode, where I get

00:29:39.150 --> 00:29:41.105
a figure 8 out of this thing.

00:29:41.105 --> 00:29:42.310
You want to see that now?

00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:44.542
PROFESSOR: Yeah, great.

00:29:44.542 --> 00:29:47.500
DR. HAROLD EDGERTON:
[INAUDIBLE]

[MACHINE NOISE GETS LOUDER]

00:30:01.330 --> 00:30:03.660
PROFESSOR: So what we'll be
seeing now is essentially a

00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:04.995
second harmonic, is it?

00:30:04.995 --> 00:30:07.590
DR. HAROLD EDGERTON: Yes, that's
the second harmonic.

00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:09.960
PROFESSOR: Justine, you think
you could make that spring

00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:13.890
dance around a little bit by
changing the strobe frequency?

00:30:13.890 --> 00:30:15.247
DR. HAROLD EDGERTON: Yeah, you
need to go around that way.

00:30:15.247 --> 00:30:17.190
You go around this way.

00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:18.340
PROFESSOR: Hey, that's
really neat.

00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:20.820
Let's turn the lights
back on if we can.

00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:22.400
DR. HAROLD EDGERTON: Tomorrow
[INAUDIBLE]

00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:24.790
it's periodic, it has
to be periodic.

00:30:24.790 --> 00:30:27.090
PROFESSOR: And what's
interesting now, if we look at

00:30:27.090 --> 00:30:31.280
this in a-- let's see, can you
flip this strobe off again?

00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:33.580
DR. HAROLD EDGERTON: Sure.

00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:35.370
DR. HAROLD EDGERTON: Notice,
Justine, when we look at the

00:30:35.370 --> 00:30:37.790
spring now, all that we
can see is a blur.

00:30:37.790 --> 00:30:40.890
And you really can't see--
because your eye can't track

00:30:40.890 --> 00:30:42.580
it, you can't see
things happening

00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:45.650
spatially in frequency.

00:30:45.650 --> 00:30:48.250
You said, by the way, that
this was originally

00:30:48.250 --> 00:30:50.190
demonstrated at the
World's Fair.

00:30:50.190 --> 00:30:52.540
DR. HAROLD EDGERTON: This
particular instrument was made

00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:55.370
the World's Fair in Chicago--
not the last one, but the one

00:30:55.370 --> 00:30:55.900
before that.

00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:56.225
PROFESSOR: Wow.

00:30:56.225 --> 00:30:59.268
DR. HAROLD EDGERTON: It was
a--you see it all scratched up

00:30:59.268 --> 00:31:01.900
because it's a--
the [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:04.880
use this thing is to
break the springs.

00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:09.080
Because of the uses, you try to
find the parts that fail.

00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:09.510
PROFESSOR: I see.

00:31:09.510 --> 00:31:11.210
You put them under stress
and fatigue and--

00:31:11.210 --> 00:31:12.946
DR. HAROLD EDGERTON: If I run
this for half an hour and so,

00:31:12.946 --> 00:31:15.010
the spring will break.

00:31:15.010 --> 00:31:19.000
And they work on automobiles,
they run them

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.175
until something vibrates.

00:31:20.175 --> 00:31:22.172
Then they find out what
the part is and what

00:31:22.172 --> 00:31:24.300
frequency it is.

00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:26.670
PROFESSOR: Well let's--by the
way, I bet you run this for a

00:31:26.670 --> 00:31:28.486
lot more than half an
hour in this state.

00:31:28.486 --> 00:31:29.320
DR. HAROLD EDGERTON: Oh, yeah,
we've broken many, many

00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:33.100
springs in this thing--
and it's continuous.

00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:36.680
We experiment, try
new things on it.

00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:39.200
PROFESSOR: Maybe we could look
at a couple of other things.

00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:40.570
How about the fan?

00:31:40.570 --> 00:31:41.070
Maybe--

00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:42.905
DR. HAROLD EDGERTON: Sure, I'll
plug this fan and this is

00:31:42.905 --> 00:31:44.886
a classic experiment
for the strobe.

00:31:44.886 --> 00:31:45.690
[MACHINE NOISE STOPS]

00:31:45.690 --> 00:31:46.680
DR. HAROLD EDGERTON:
That's a good idea.

00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:47.946
Get that thing off.

00:31:47.946 --> 00:31:50.562
Makes too much noise.

00:31:50.562 --> 00:31:52.825
PROFESSOR: Guess, we move
that over here.

00:31:52.825 --> 00:31:55.750
DR. HAROLD EDGERTON: This is
just an ordinary electric fan,

00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:58.720
but it has a mark on one
blade, so that you can

00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:00.810
identify it.

00:32:00.810 --> 00:32:02.060
We'll plug it in, get
it up to speed.

00:32:09.410 --> 00:32:11.650
PROFESSOR: This looks like a fan
that was also demonstrated

00:32:11.650 --> 00:32:14.775
in the World's Fair,
a few years ago.

00:32:14.775 --> 00:32:16.025
DR. HAROLD EDGERTON: Yeah,
could've been.

00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:20.700
There was a movie Quicker'n
a Wink had this

00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:22.170
thing in there and--

00:32:22.170 --> 00:32:24.790
PROFESSOR: With this very fan?

00:32:24.790 --> 00:32:26.090
DR. HAROLD EDGERTON:
Well, one like it.

00:32:26.090 --> 00:32:28.220
It was loaned to MGM.

00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:35.900
And Pete Smith, he said he
wanted me to throw out a

00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:37.030
custard pie into it.

00:32:37.030 --> 00:32:40.680
I said, no, I'm a serious
scientist.

00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:44.730
So he says, let's compromise
on the egg.

00:32:44.730 --> 00:32:47.820
So we dropped an egg into it and
you would see a high-speed

00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:49.780
movie of the egg dropping.

00:32:49.780 --> 00:32:52.090
No, not with the strobe, but
with this [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:52.090 --> 00:32:54.065
PROFESSOR: That was with the
high-speed photography.

00:32:54.065 --> 00:32:56.860
DR. HAROLD EDGERTON: High-speed
movies, yeah.

00:32:56.860 --> 00:32:59.080
PROFESSOR: So again, I guess,
without the strobe, when we

00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:04.470
look at it, what we're looking
at are frequencies that are

00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:06.020
much higher than the
eye can follow.

00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:09.750
And now, with the strobe on,
you can see both the alias

00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:12.470
frequency and you can also see
the original frequency because

00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:15.970
we had the incandescent
light on.

00:33:15.970 --> 00:33:20.210
Let's turn down the background
light again.

00:33:20.210 --> 00:33:22.580
And then, really all that we're
able to see are the

00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:25.770
aliasing frequencies.

00:33:25.770 --> 00:33:30.650
And I guess when we see more
than one mark, that means that

00:33:30.650 --> 00:33:32.910
we're actually running it at--

00:33:32.910 --> 00:33:34.330
DR. HAROLD EDGERTON: Four times
the speed of the fan.

00:33:34.330 --> 00:33:35.870
PROFESSOR: --four times the
speed the fan, yeah.

00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:38.140
DR. HAROLD EDGERTON: You see
a little variation in the--

00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:38.515
PROFESSOR: Oh, yeah.

00:33:38.515 --> 00:33:38.650
Right.

00:33:38.650 --> 00:33:39.990
DR. HAROLD EDGERTON: It's
because the blades aren't

00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:41.050
exactly the same.

00:33:41.050 --> 00:33:42.450
PROFESSOR: Actually, this
gives me a chance to

00:33:42.450 --> 00:33:46.780
illustrate another important
point related to the lecture.

00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:50.210
Let's see, can we bring it down
to a frequency so that we

00:33:50.210 --> 00:33:51.620
only get one mark?

00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:52.870
DR. HAROLD EDGERTON: Sure.

00:33:56.171 --> 00:33:58.540
You may miss this because
it's too lowered to just

00:33:58.540 --> 00:34:00.550
one blade there now.

00:34:00.550 --> 00:34:02.580
PROFESSOR: So the way we have
it now, we've essentially

00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:05.800
aliased the fan's speed down
so that it's just a little

00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:07.950
higher than DC.

00:34:07.950 --> 00:34:11.380
And now, I'm right at DC.

00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:14.810
And now, if I go down just a
little further, in fact it

00:34:14.810 --> 00:34:17.770
looks like the fan is
turning backwards.

00:34:17.770 --> 00:34:22.159
And if you think of this in the
context of aliasing, it's

00:34:22.159 --> 00:34:25.670
like the two impulses in
the frequency domain

00:34:25.670 --> 00:34:26.929
have crossed over.

00:34:26.929 --> 00:34:30.540
And what you get in effect, if
you analyze it mathematically,

00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:32.770
is you get a phase reversal.

00:34:32.770 --> 00:34:37.870
And it wasn't until I first
understood about aliasing, by

00:34:37.870 --> 00:34:40.790
the way, Doc, that I understood
why when I went to

00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:44.420
Western movies, every once in
a while you'd see the wagon

00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:46.570
wheels turning backwards.

00:34:46.570 --> 00:34:49.600
Then there's the wagon wheels
of the Western movie going

00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:51.600
backwards, I guess.

00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:53.879
And, Justine, why don't
you see if you can--

00:34:53.879 --> 00:34:54.980
DR. HAROLD EDGERTON: Too
much flicker there.

00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:57.460
Why don't you bring it up
so you get two marks.

00:34:57.460 --> 00:34:59.740
PROFESSOR: See if you can bring
the frequency up so that

00:34:59.740 --> 00:35:00.990
you get two marks.

00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:04.060
DR. HAROLD EDGERTON: You
turn that, Justine.

00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:08.100
Grab right ahold of that and
give it a big twist.

00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:09.350
You went past it.

00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:14.320
They're not regular there now.

00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:14.910
Here we are.

00:35:14.910 --> 00:35:16.150
Now hold it right there.

00:35:16.150 --> 00:35:19.290
Put your finger on there,
hold the dial.

00:35:19.290 --> 00:35:21.200
It's flashing twice per
revolution now, Al.

00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:23.620
PROFESSOR: I guess another thing
that this demonstrates

00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:27.500
is something that I've heard a
long time ago, which is that

00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:30.850
you should never use a power saw
with a fluorescent light

00:35:30.850 --> 00:35:32.940
because the fluorescent light
gives you a little bit of a

00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:36.230
strobe effect and you could
actually convince yourself

00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:39.670
that that's standing still and
make the mistake of trying to

00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:40.870
put your finger between
the blades.

00:35:40.870 --> 00:35:42.850
DR. HAROLD EDGERTON: You want to
stick your finger in there?

00:35:42.850 --> 00:35:44.330
PROFESSOR: No, I don't think
I want to try it.

00:35:44.330 --> 00:35:45.290
How about you, Justine?

00:35:45.290 --> 00:35:45.800
What do you think?

00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:47.910
Is that standing still
or is that moving?

00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:49.800
DR. HAROLD EDGERTON: She
knows it's going.

00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:53.140
We won't let her get
close to that fan.

00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:56.580
PROFESSOR: Actually if we turn
the lights back on again, what

00:35:56.580 --> 00:35:59.470
that will let us see once again
is that we can see both

00:35:59.470 --> 00:36:03.240
the alias frequencies when we
do that and we can also see

00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:08.070
the higher frequencies because
of the incandescent lighting.

00:36:08.070 --> 00:36:12.010
Maybe what we can do now
is take a look at

00:36:12.010 --> 00:36:13.260
some other fun things.

00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:16.160
And one I guess I'm curious
about is the disk that you

00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:17.870
have over there.

00:36:17.870 --> 00:36:22.120
Doc, maybe you can tell
us what we have here?

00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:22.610
DR. HAROLD EDGERTON: Sure, Al.

00:36:22.610 --> 00:36:26.530
This is a disk to show how you
can get motion pictures out of

00:36:26.530 --> 00:36:29.240
a series of still pictures.

00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:31.970
This circle is repeated
12 times.

00:36:31.970 --> 00:36:35.820
The white dot goes from the
outer part of it on this side

00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:37.600
to the inner part
on the other.

00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:40.740
If I flash one time per
revolution on this, you'll see

00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:42.315
it exactly as it is.

00:36:42.315 --> 00:36:46.060
But if I skip one picture each
time, then you get the

00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:48.930
relative motion of this ball.

00:36:48.930 --> 00:36:52.030
Well, the object is to show the
ball rotating either this

00:36:52.030 --> 00:36:54.490
way or that way depending on
whether the strobe was going

00:36:54.490 --> 00:36:56.506
faster or slower
than the other.

00:36:59.110 --> 00:37:01.970
This way motion pictures were
developed hundred years ago,

00:37:01.970 --> 00:37:03.140
long before photography.

00:37:03.140 --> 00:37:05.580
They drew pictures of
people in different

00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:07.180
poses, animated pictures.

00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:07.930
Like to see it run?

00:37:07.930 --> 00:37:09.230
PROFESSOR: Yeah, great.

00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:13.090
It's actually, the title, kind
of, is "Aliasing Can Be Fun."

00:37:13.090 --> 00:37:14.340
DR. HAROLD EDGERTON:
That's right.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:20.015
Let me get it up to speed.

00:37:20.015 --> 00:37:22.480
On the way up, you get a lot
of different, sort of,

00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:24.160
patterns as it goes through.

00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:27.513
When it eventually reaches its
speed, which is about 1,100

00:37:27.513 --> 00:37:31.400
per minute, you'll
see it stop.

00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:33.550
PROFESSOR: And the background
blur, basically at the high

00:37:33.550 --> 00:37:37.530
frequencies that the eye can't
follow and then, kind of,

00:37:37.530 --> 00:37:41.520
superimposed on that again, we
can see the frequencies that

00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:42.530
are aliased down.

00:37:42.530 --> 00:37:44.306
And that's what the
eye can follow.

00:37:44.306 --> 00:37:46.320
DR. HAROLD EDGERTON: Right now,
we have one flash per

00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:49.145
revolution, so you can see the
part of the disk that's

00:37:49.145 --> 00:37:51.790
illuminated with the strobe
exactly as if it

00:37:51.790 --> 00:37:53.015
was standing still.

00:37:53.015 --> 00:37:57.260
Now if I increase the frequency,
so they skip one

00:37:57.260 --> 00:37:59.780
circle, then you get
the illusion

00:37:59.780 --> 00:38:01.300
that, that dot is moving.

00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:04.960
PROFESSOR: In fact, let's really
enhance the revolution,

00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:09.100
let's turn the incandescent
lights off again.

00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:11.690
And now, now what we see
really are the alias

00:38:11.690 --> 00:38:13.780
frequencies.

00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:15.510
What do you think
of this Justine?

00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:17.310
JUSTINE: Neat.

00:38:17.310 --> 00:38:19.190
DR. HAROLD EDGERTON: It
looks like magic.

00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:22.517
I still have great joy in
watching this thing, though

00:38:22.517 --> 00:38:23.770
it's so simple.

00:38:23.770 --> 00:38:25.420
PROFESSOR: Now, while we're
watching this, something also

00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:31.780
I might point out for the
lecture--for the course-- is

00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:34.620
that actually there really are
two sampling frequencies that

00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:35.100
we're seeing.

00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:37.190
One is the strobe, which is the

00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:38.910
strobe that you're running.

00:38:38.910 --> 00:38:42.290
The other is the inherent frame
rate for the TV, that's

00:38:42.290 --> 00:38:44.400
running at 30 frames a second.

00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:47.070
And that's one of the reasons,
by the way, that people

00:38:47.070 --> 00:38:51.750
watching this on the video
course are in fact seeing a

00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:56.690
flicker or a beating or
modulation between the two

00:38:56.690 --> 00:38:59.060
unsynchronized frame rates.

00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:00.450
DR. HAROLD EDGERTON: I'll run
the frequencies of the strobe

00:39:00.450 --> 00:39:04.195
up, so we get two of
them in there.

00:39:04.195 --> 00:39:05.660
You keep watching,
we had all these

00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:06.910
other interesting patterns.

00:39:09.235 --> 00:39:09.700
There's two now.

00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:12.360
And I'll make the two bounce
on each other.

00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:21.640
You get all these patterns
for free.

00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:24.225
You design a disk to show one
thing and then when you run

00:39:24.225 --> 00:39:26.480
it, you find all the
other patterns.

00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:29.000
PROFESSOR: I think it would be
a terrific homework problem

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.310
for the video course, to have
them all sit down and analyze

00:39:32.310 --> 00:39:34.130
all the frequencies that
they're seeing and what

00:39:34.130 --> 00:39:35.140
they're being aliased to.

00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:35.760
What do you think of that?

00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:37.670
DR. HAROLD EDGERTON:
That's a good idea.

00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:40.780
As a teacher, I love
to give quizzes.

00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:42.410
Find out whether the students
are listening.

00:39:42.410 --> 00:39:44.000
PROFESSOR: I think that'll chase
a few people away from

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:45.190
the course, that's
what I like--

00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:47.900
DR. HAROLD EDGERTON: No, it
attracts them because you get

00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:51.540
involved in these optical
things, there's no limit on

00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:54.380
what you can do.

00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:56.960
PROFESSOR: Let's bring the
incandescent lights back up

00:39:56.960 --> 00:39:59.880
again, just to remind everybody
that in back of all

00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:03.920
these are some frequencies that
are a lot higher than the

00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:05.640
ones that we begin to get the

00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:07.100
impression that we're watching.

00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:09.270
DR. HAROLD EDGERTON: It's just
a motor running at constant

00:40:09.270 --> 00:40:11.440
speed with a pattern on it.

00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:17.110
PROFESSOR: Doc, I have to say
that there aren't many people

00:40:17.110 --> 00:40:19.700
I know that have as much fun
in their work as you do.

00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:21.805
DR. HAROLD EDGERTON: Well,
I'm a lucky man.

00:40:21.805 --> 00:40:25.260
PROFESSOR: Well, what I'd like
to do now, maybe, is take a

00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:26.950
look at one last experiment,
if you could.

00:40:26.950 --> 00:40:27.870
DR. HAROLD EDGERTON: Sure.

00:40:27.870 --> 00:40:32.290
PROFESSOR: And what I'd like to
do is go take a look at, I

00:40:32.290 --> 00:40:35.310
guess, what sometimes is called
the--well, not the

00:40:35.310 --> 00:40:37.320
water drop experiment-- what's
the name of the--

00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:38.080
DR. HAROLD EDGERTON: You mean
the Double Piddler Hydraulic

00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:39.710
Happening Machine?

00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:40.750
PROFESSOR: That's the one
I was thinking of.

00:40:40.750 --> 00:40:42.970
Let's take a look over there.

00:40:42.970 --> 00:40:43.680
DR. HAROLD EDGERTON: Come
on, Justine, let's go

00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:44.930
and turn on the water.

00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:51.990
PROFESSOR: So, Doc, this is
the--what did you call it

00:40:51.990 --> 00:40:54.370
DPHHM for Double Piddler
Hydraulic Happening Machine?

00:40:57.590 --> 00:41:00.000
Got it.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.110
DR. HAROLD EDGERTON: It looks
like a continuous

00:41:01.110 --> 00:41:02.620
stream, but it's not.

00:41:02.620 --> 00:41:04.365
It's a pump over there.

00:41:04.365 --> 00:41:07.480
It's pumping 60 pulses
a second.

00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:09.680
The water is coming
out in spurts.

00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:13.790
PROFESSOR: So actually, again
it's the 60 pulses a second

00:41:13.790 --> 00:41:15.000
your eye can't follow.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:16.910
DR. HAROLD EDGERTON: Your eye's
no good at 60 a second.

00:41:16.910 --> 00:41:18.450
PROFESSOR: Basically
looks like a blur.

00:41:18.450 --> 00:41:20.850
DR. HAROLD EDGERTON: It is a
blur, a nice juicy blur.

00:41:20.850 --> 00:41:22.100
Now we put the strobe on.

00:41:27.970 --> 00:41:31.270
PROFESSOR: So again, I guess
we have this essentially

00:41:31.270 --> 00:41:32.390
aliased down.

00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:34.060
And again with the incandescent
light, you can

00:41:34.060 --> 00:41:39.210
see both the high frequency
and the alias frequency.

00:41:39.210 --> 00:41:43.930
And let's see, I guess that's
what the frequency close to DC

00:41:43.930 --> 00:41:47.480
and we can adjust it so
that it's stopped.

00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:48.640
DR. HAROLD EDGERTON: All right,
make the water go up.

00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:51.410
PROFESSOR: And then we can
actually make it go up.

00:41:51.410 --> 00:41:53.950
DR. HAROLD EDGERTON: Of course,
nobody believes that.

00:41:53.950 --> 00:41:57.580
PROFESSOR: Yeah, in fact, let me
just again, to stress this

00:41:57.580 --> 00:41:59.110
point to the class.

00:41:59.110 --> 00:42:02.930
The idea here of the phase
reversal-- of course, you can

00:42:02.930 --> 00:42:05.990
see it in the time domain-- you
just think about when the

00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:08.040
flashes of light come.

00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:12.770
But if you think of these
impulses that we have in the

00:42:12.770 --> 00:42:16.580
frequency domain and we're
aliasing as we change the

00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:19.540
sampling frequency, what happens
is that these impulses

00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:23.390
cross over and what that means
is that we get a phase

00:42:23.390 --> 00:42:28.270
reversal depending on which
phases are associated with

00:42:28.270 --> 00:42:31.130
which side of DC so that's
kind of the idea

00:42:31.130 --> 00:42:32.380
of the phase reversal.

00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:36.150
Let's turn the--

00:42:36.150 --> 00:42:37.710
DR. HAROLD EDGERTON: Well, we
tried to have Justine put her

00:42:37.710 --> 00:42:39.090
finger in between
those two drops.

00:42:39.090 --> 00:42:40.090
PROFESSOR: Yeah, let's turn the

00:42:40.090 --> 00:42:41.990
incandescent light off first.

00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:42.260
And--

00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:43.610
DR. HAROLD EDGERTON: Take
one finger out now.

00:42:43.610 --> 00:42:45.460
Put it right in between
those two drops.

00:42:45.460 --> 00:42:46.330
PROFESSOR: Justine,you think
you can do that?

00:42:46.330 --> 00:42:47.420
DR. HAROLD EDGERTON: Better
get on the other side.

00:42:47.420 --> 00:42:49.525
Use your other hand, so
they can see with it.

00:42:49.525 --> 00:42:50.330
You can--

00:42:50.330 --> 00:42:52.620
PROFESSOR: Think you can get
your finger in there?

00:42:52.620 --> 00:42:55.530
PROFESSOR: Whoop, there's water
there all the time.

00:42:55.530 --> 00:42:56.790
PROFESSOR: Well I
don't know, Doc.

00:42:56.790 --> 00:43:00.520
It seems to me if we-- can't
we just adjust this so that

00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:02.030
the dots just go through
each other?

00:43:02.030 --> 00:43:03.230
DR. HAROLD EDGERTON: Sure.

00:43:03.230 --> 00:43:05.038
PROFESSOR: Now if the dots can
do it, Justine, how come you

00:43:05.038 --> 00:43:06.490
can't get your finger
in there?

00:43:06.490 --> 00:43:06.720
JUSTINE: I don't know.

00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:08.060
PROFESSOR: Why don't you
try that once more?

00:43:10.910 --> 00:43:12.020
I guess not.

00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:13.030
DR. HAROLD EDGERTON: No,
that's one thing you

00:43:13.030 --> 00:43:14.450
can't do with it.

00:43:14.450 --> 00:43:18.080
PROFESSOR: Well let's bring the
lights back up and again,

00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:23.480
just to stress the point, here
we are at DC, here we are at a

00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:28.580
frequency that's just a little
above DC, and we can go back

00:43:28.580 --> 00:43:31.560
down to DC and we can actually
get a phase reversal.

00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:34.850
And I guess, if we do this long
enough, we can empty out

00:43:34.850 --> 00:43:36.580
the whole ocean and
put it back in

00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:37.490
wherever it comes from.

00:43:37.490 --> 00:43:37.950
Isn't that right?

00:43:37.950 --> 00:43:39.010
DR. HAROLD EDGERTON: And we
caution the students when they

00:43:39.010 --> 00:43:40.370
run this, not to run
it too long--

00:43:40.370 --> 00:43:40.480
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:41.820
DR. HAROLD EDGERTON: We've
got the bucket here.

00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:42.730
PROFESSOR: You have
to be careful--

00:43:42.730 --> 00:43:43.200
DR. HAROLD EDGERTON: --and
it's been a while since

00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:45.130
somebody believes me.

00:43:45.130 --> 00:43:47.130
PROFESSOR: Well, I don't know
about them, but I guess I

00:43:47.130 --> 00:43:48.862
believe you, Doc.

00:43:48.862 --> 00:43:50.580
DR. HAROLD EDGERTON: I'll put
a little more pressure on so

00:43:50.580 --> 00:43:53.876
we get little more interesting
patterns.

00:43:53.876 --> 00:43:57.200
Little patterns or surface
tension that's pulling in

00:43:57.200 --> 00:43:58.450
things together.

00:44:01.250 --> 00:44:04.412
We have these machines, they're
all over the place.

00:44:04.412 --> 00:44:05.990
They're a lot of fun.

00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:07.790
PROFESSOR: Well, Doc, this
is really terrific.

00:44:07.790 --> 00:44:14.410
I think that this whole idea of
using aliasing and strobes

00:44:14.410 --> 00:44:17.430
and the kinds of things
that you do with

00:44:17.430 --> 00:44:19.050
them are just fantastic.

00:44:19.050 --> 00:44:22.630
And we really appreciate the
chance to come in here and see

00:44:22.630 --> 00:44:23.432
the demonstration.

00:44:23.432 --> 00:44:24.750
DR. HAROLD EDGERTON: Well,
that's the whole game.

00:44:24.750 --> 00:44:25.680
We've [? been happy to use ?]

00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:29.660
them for years and probably will
for many years to come.

00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:32.970
PROFESSOR: So as I emphasized
at the beginning, in lots of

00:44:32.970 --> 00:44:36.490
situations aliasing can, in
fact, be very useful.

00:44:36.490 --> 00:44:40.020
Also what this demonstrates is
that particularly when you

00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:43.470
have a colleague, like Doc
Edgerton, aliasing and for

00:44:43.470 --> 00:44:45.260
that matter science, in
general, can be an

00:44:45.260 --> 00:44:46.130
awful lot of fun.

00:44:46.130 --> 00:44:47.670
DR. HAROLD EDGERTON: Thanks
for coming in.

00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:48.920
PROFESSOR: Thanks a lot, Doc.

00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:49.370
DR. HAROLD EDGERTON:
See you again.

00:44:49.370 --> 00:44:50.580
PROFESSOR: And thank
you, Justine.

00:44:50.580 --> 00:44:51.830
JUSTINE: You're welcome.

00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:58.610
PROFESSOR: Well, I have to say
that visit was an awful lot of

00:44:58.610 --> 00:45:03.450
fun for me and for Justine and
in fact, for the whole camera

00:45:03.450 --> 00:45:04.850
crew that was there.

00:45:04.850 --> 00:45:08.330
And hopefully, all of you at
some point will also have a

00:45:08.330 --> 00:45:12.130
chance to visit at
Strobe Alley.

00:45:12.130 --> 00:45:16.480
Well, hopefully what we've gone
through today gives you a

00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:20.680
good feeling for the concepts
of sampling and aliasing and

00:45:20.680 --> 00:45:23.540
both, why it might be useful
and why we might

00:45:23.540 --> 00:45:25.910
want to avoid it.

00:45:25.910 --> 00:45:29.260
In the next lecture, we'll
continue on the

00:45:29.260 --> 00:45:31.200
discussion of sampling.

00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:34.840
And in particular, what I'll
be talking about is the

00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:39.020
interpretation of the
reconstruction process not in

00:45:39.020 --> 00:45:42.930
the frequency domain, but in a
time domain and interpretation

00:45:42.930 --> 00:45:46.950
specifically associated with the
concept of interpolating

00:45:46.950 --> 00:45:48.450
between the samples.

00:45:48.450 --> 00:45:51.970
We'll then proceed from there
to a discussion as I've

00:45:51.970 --> 00:45:57.070
alluded to in several lectures
of what I've referred to as

00:45:57.070 --> 00:46:01.150
discrete-time processing of
continuous-time signals, very

00:46:01.150 --> 00:46:04.560
heavily exploiting the
concept and issues

00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:06.110
associated with sampling.

00:46:06.110 --> 00:46:07.360
Thank you.
