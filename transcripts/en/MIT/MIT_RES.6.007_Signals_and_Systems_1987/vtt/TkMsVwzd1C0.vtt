00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.900
PROFESSOR: Over the last several
lectures, we developed

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:03.320
the Fourier representation for
continuous-time signals.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.760
What I'd now like to do
is develop a similar

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.230
representation for
discrete-time.

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.940
And let me begin the discussion
by reminding you of

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.280
what our basic motivation was.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.780
The idea is that what we wanted
to do was exploit the

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.640
properties of linearity and
time invariance for linear

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.330
time-invariant systems.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.860
So in the case of linear
time-invariant systems, the

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:38.650
basic idea was to consider
decomposing the input as a

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.730
linear combination
of basic inputs.

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:46.620
And then, because of linearity,
the output could be

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.960
expressed as a linear
combination of corresponding

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:59.610
outputs where psi sub i is the
output due to phi sub i.

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.440
So basically, what we attempted
to do was decompose

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.710
the input, and then reconstruct
the output through

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:13.620
a linear combination of the
outputs to those basic inputs.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.020
We then focused on the notion
of choosing the basic inputs

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.890
with two criteria in mind.

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.900
One was to choose them so that a
broad class of signals could

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.020
be constructed out of
those basic inputs.

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:35.000
And the second was to choose the
basic inputs, so that the

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.800
response to those was
easy to compute.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.570
And as you recall, one
representation that we ended

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:47.050
up with, with those basic
criteria in mind, was the

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.500
representation through
convolution.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.610
And then in beginning the
discussion of the Fourier

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.980
representation of
continuous-time signals, we

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:01.880
chose as another set of basic
inputs complex exponentials.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:07.860
So for continuous-time, we chose
a set of basic inputs

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.380
which were complex
exponentials.

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.470
The motivation there was the
fact that the complex

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.950
exponentials have what
we refer to as the

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:20.940
eigenfunction property.

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.190
Namely, if we put complex
exponentials into our

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:29.540
continuous-time systems, then
the output is a complex

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.830
exponential of the same
form with only a

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.980
change in complex amplitude.

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.450
And that change in complex
amplitude is what we referred

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:48.930
to as the frequency response
of the system.

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.040
And also, by the way, as it
developed later, that

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.470
frequency response, as you
should now recognize from this

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.380
expression, is in fact the
Fourier transform, the

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.120
continuous-time Fourier
transform of the system

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.170
impulse response.

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.790
And the notion of decomposing
a signal as a linear

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:15.960
combination of these complex
exponentials is what, first

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:19.260
the Fourier series
representation, and then later

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.130
the Fourier transform
representation

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:22.680
corresponded to.

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:28.390
And finally, to remind you of
one additional point, the fact

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.370
is that because of
the eigenfunction

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.640
property, the response--

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.580
once we have decomposed the
input as a linear combination

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.920
of complex exponentials, the
response to that linear

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:44.820
combination is straightforward
to compute once we know the

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:50.110
frequency response because of
the eigenfunction property.

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:54.790
Now, basically the same strategy
and many of the same

00:04:54.790 --> 00:05:00.120
ideas work in discrete-time,
paralleling almost exactly

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.390
what happened in
continuous-time.

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:05.180
So the similarities between
discrete-time and

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.690
continuous-time are
very strong.

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.710
Although as we'll see, there are
a number of differences.

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:15.460
And it's important as we go
through the discussion to

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:20.210
illuminate not only the
similarities, but obviously

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:22.160
also the differences.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.800
Well, let's begin with the
eigenfunction property, and

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:31.900
let me just state that just as
in continuous-time, if we

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.580
consider a set of basic signals,
which are complex

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.770
exponential rules, then
discrete-time linear time-m

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:45.390
invariant systems have the
eigenfunction property.

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:50.200
Namely, if we put a complex
exponential into the system,

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.970
the response is a complex
exponential at the same

00:05:53.970 --> 00:06:00.270
complex frequency, and simply
multiplied by an appropriate

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:03.620
complex factor, or constant.

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:11.510
And just as we did in
continuous-time, we will be

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:15.980
referring to this complex
constant, which is a function,

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:19.910
of course, the frequency of the
complex exponential input.

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:24.400
We'll be referring to this as
the frequency response.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.980
And although it's not
particularly evident at this

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:32.020
point, as the discussion
develops through this lecture,

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:36.620
what in fact will happen is
very much paralleling

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:38.340
continuous-time.

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:43.990
This particular expression, in
fact, will correspond to what

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:48.550
we'll refer to as the Fourier
transform, the discrete-time

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:52.030
Fourier transform of the system
impulse response.

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:55.190
So there, of course, there's a
very strong parallel between

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:58.330
continuous time and
discrete time.

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:02.750
Now, just as we did in
continuous-time, let's begin

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:07.720
the discussion by first
concentrating on periodic--

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:11.010
the representation through
complex exponentials of

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:16.030
periodic sequences, and then
we'll generalize that

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:18.270
discussion to the
representation

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:20.570
of aperiodic signals.

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:26.190
So let's consider first a
periodic signal, or in

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:28.900
general, signals which
are periodic.

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:33.530
Period denoted by capital N.
And then, of course, the

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:39.610
fundamental frequency is 2
pi divided by capital N.

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:45.200
Now, we can consider
exponentials which have this

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:50.390
as a fundamental frequency, or
which are harmonics of that,

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:53.880
and that would correspond
to the class of complex

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:59.290
exponentials of the form
e to the jk omega 0 n.

00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:06.610
So these complex exponentials
then, as k varies, are complex

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:11.930
exponentials that are
harmonically related, all of

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:16.730
which are periodic with the
same period capital N.

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:19.680
Although the fundamental
period is

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:20.960
different for each of these.

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:26.150
Each of them being related
by an integer amount.

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:29.830
Now, again, just as we did in
continuous time, we can

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:34.390
consider attempting to build our
periodic signal out of a

00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:36.780
linear combination of these.

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:43.280
And so we consider a periodic
signal, which is a weighted

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:48.060
sum of these complex
exponentials.

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:50.980
And, of course, this
periodic signal--

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:52.420
this is a periodic signal.

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:56.460
This can be verified, more or
less, in a straightforward way

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:58.150
by substitution.

00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:00.950
And, of course, one of the
things that we'll want to

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:04.930
address shortly is how broad a
class of signals, again, can

00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:07.310
be represented by this sum?

00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:10.730
And another question obviously
will be, how do we determine

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:13.860
the coefficients a sub k?

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:20.010
However, before we do that, let
me focus on an important

00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:23.210
distinction between
continuous-time and

00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:26.950
discrete-time in the context of
these complex exponentials

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:30.420
and this representation.

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:34.140
When we talked about complex
exponentials and sinusoids

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:38.100
early in the course, one of the
differences that we saw

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:42.380
between continuous-time and
discrete-time is that in

00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:46.990
continuous-time, as we vary the
frequency variable, we see

00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:52.100
different complex exponentials
as omega varies.

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:56.580
Whereas, in discrete-time, we
saw, in fact, that there was a

00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:57.750
periodicity.

00:09:57.750 --> 00:10:03.670
Or said another way, it's
straightforward to verify that

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:08.880
if we think of this class
of complex exponentials.

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:17.490
That, in fact, if we consider
varying k by adding to it

00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:23.670
capital N, where capital N is
the period of the fundamental

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:25.690
complex exponential.

00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:33.700
Then in fact, if we replace k by
k plus capital N, we'll see

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:38.810
exactly the same complex
exponentials over again.

00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:39.690
Now, what does that say?

00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:43.430
What it says is that if I
consider this class of complex

00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:52.790
exponentials, as k varies from
0 through capital N minus 1,

00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:56.050
we will see all of the ones
that there are to see.

00:10:56.050 --> 00:10:58.060
There aren't anymore.

00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:03.160
And so, in fact, if we can
build x of n out of this

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:08.600
linear combination, then we
better be able to do it as k

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:16.230
varies from 0 up to N minus 1.

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:20.990
Because beyond that, we'll
simply see the same complex

00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:22.870
exponentials over again.

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:27.670
So, for example, if k takes on
the value capital N, that will

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:31.630
be exactly the same complex
exponential as if

00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:34.300
k is equal to 0.

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:41.070
So in fact, this sum ranges
only over capital N of the

00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:43.430
distinct complex exponentials.

00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:47.100
Let's say, for example, from
0 to capital N minus 1 .

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:52.130
Although, in fact, since these
complex exponentials repeat in

00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:57.450
k, I could actually consider
instead of from 0 to N minus

00:11:57.450 --> 00:12:01.240
1, I could consider from
1 to N, or from 2 to

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:03.800
N plus 1, or whatever.

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:09.260
Or said another way, in this
representation, I could

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:16.310
alternatively choose k outside
this range, thinking of these

00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:20.430
coefficients simply as
periodically repeating in k

00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:24.660
because of the fact that these
complex exponentials

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:27.580
periodically repeat in k.

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:31.130
So, in fact, in place of this
expression, it will be common

00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:35.080
in writing the Fourier series
expression to write it as I've

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:38.910
indicated here, where the
implication is that these

00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:44.260
Fourier coefficients
periodically repeat as k

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:47.350
continues to repeat outside
the interval from

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:49.370
0 to N minus 1.

00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:54.520
And so this notation, in fact,
says that what we're going to

00:12:54.520 --> 00:13:02.270
use is k ranging over one
period of this periodic

00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:04.590
sequence, which is the Fourier
series coefficients.

00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:13.330
So the expression that we have
then for the Fourier series

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:15.280
I've repeated here.

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:18.360
And the implication
now is that the

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:20.650
a sub k's are periodic.

00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:22.820
They periodically repeat
because, of course, these

00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:25.150
exponentials periodically
repeat.

00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:29.490
This indicates that we only
use them over one period.

00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:33.930
And now we can inquire as
to how we determine the

00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:36.120
coefficients a sub k.

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:39.480
Well, we can formally go through
this much as we did in

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:41.550
the continuous-time case.

00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:45.070
And we do, in fact, do that in
the text, which involves

00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:48.310
substituting some sums and
interchanging the orders of

00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:49.790
summation, et cetera.

00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:54.020
But let me draw your attention
to the fact that this, in

00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:59.290
fact, can be thought of as
capital N equations and

00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:02.210
capital N unknowns.

00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:08.100
In other words, we know x of n
over a period, and so we know

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:12.280
what the left-hand side of this
is for capital N values.

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:16.070
And we'd like to determine
these constants a sub k.

00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:18.860
Well, it turns out that there
is a nice convenient

00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:21.050
closed-form expression
for that.

00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:26.060
And, in fact, if we evaluate
the closed-form expression

00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:29.860
through any of a variety of
algebraic manipulations, we

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:35.290
end up then with the
analysis equation.

00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:39.150
And the analysis equation, which
tells us how to get the

00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:47.080
coefficients a sub k from x of n
is what I've indicated here.

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:53.020
And so this tells us how from
x of n to get the a sub k's.

00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:58.140
And, of course, the first
equation tells us how x of n

00:14:58.140 --> 00:15:01.120
is built up out of
the a sub k.

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:05.520
Notice incidentally that there
is a strong duality between

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:07.050
these two equations.

00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:11.590
And that's a duality that we'll
return to, actually

00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:13.750
toward the end of the
next lecture.

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:16.340
Now, there is a real difference
between the way

00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:19.630
those equations look and the
way the continuous-time

00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:21.540
Fourier series looked.

00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:26.650
In the continuous-time case,
let me remind you that it

00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:31.630
required an infinite number of
coefficients to build up this

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:33.800
continuous-time function.

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:37.720
And so this was not simply a
matter of identifying how to

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:41.180
invert capital N or a finite
number of equations and a

00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:44.280
finite number of unknowns.

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:51.210
And the analysis equation was
an integration as opposed to

00:15:51.210 --> 00:15:55.510
the synthesis equation,
which is a summation.

00:15:55.510 --> 00:15:59.400
So there is a real difference
there between the

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:01.960
continuous-time and
discrete-time cases.

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:06.560
And the difference arises, to
a large extent, because of

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:09.480
this notion that in
discrete-time, the complex

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:16.050
exponentials are periodic
in their frequency.

00:16:16.050 --> 00:16:21.470
So we have then to summarize the
synthesis equation and the

00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:27.210
analysis equation for the
discrete-time Fourier series.

00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:32.250
Again, x of n, our original
signal is periodic.

00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:35.400
And, of course, the complex
exponentials

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:38.230
involved are periodic.

00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:40.680
They're periodic
obviously in n.

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:43.530
But in contrast to
continuous-time,

00:16:43.530 --> 00:16:46.370
these repeat in k.

00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:51.070
In other words, as k omega 0
goes outside a range that

00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:53.500
covers a 2 pi interval.

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:57.570
And because of that, we're
imposing, in a sense, the

00:16:57.570 --> 00:17:00.450
interpretation that
the a sub k's are

00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:02.820
likewise a periodic sequence.

00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:07.890
And in fact, if we look at the
analysis equation, as we let k

00:17:07.890 --> 00:17:14.010
vary outside the range from 0
to N minus 1, what you can

00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:18.680
easily verify by substitution in
here is that this sequence

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:22.030
will, in fact, periodically
repeat.

00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:26.300
So to underscore the difference
between the

00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:30.320
continuous-time and
discrete-time cases, we have

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:33.730
this periodicity in the time
domain, and that's a

00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:38.200
periodicity that is, of course,
true in discrete-time

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:43.520
and it's also true in
continuous-time if we replace

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:48.820
the integer variable by the
discrete-time time variable.

00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:53.620
And we also, in discrete-time,
have this periodicity in k, or

00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:55.430
in k omega 0.

00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:58.700
And correspondingly, a
periodicity in the Fourier

00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:00.240
coefficients.

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:06.980
And that is a set of properties
that does not

00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:10.300
happen in continuous-time.

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:15.520
And it is that that essentially
leads to all of

00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:18.650
the important differences
between discrete-time Fourier

00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:21.390
representations and
continuous-time Fourier

00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:24.250
representations.

00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:29.430
Now, just quickly, let me draw
your attention to the issue of

00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:33.400
convergence and when a sequence
can and can't be

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:35.370
represented, et cetera.

00:18:35.370 --> 00:18:39.620
And recall that in the
continuous-time case, we

00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:44.530
focused on convergence in the
context either of conditions,

00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:48.310
which I referred to as square
integrability, or another set

00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:51.510
of conditions, which were the
Dirichlet conditions.

00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:55.310
And there was this issue about
when the signal does and

00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:58.480
doesn't converge at
discontinuities, et cetera.

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:02.330
Let me just simply draw your
attention to the fact that in

00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:07.470
the discrete-time case, what we
have is the representation

00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:12.620
of the periodic signal
as a sum of a

00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:14.750
finite number of terms.

00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:17.350
This represents capital
N equations

00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:19.850
and capital N unknowns.

00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:24.980
If we consider earth the partial
sum, namely taking a

00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:31.640
smaller number of terms, then
simply what happens is as the

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:36.480
number of terms increases to the
finite number required to

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:41.620
represent x of n, we simply end
up with the partial sum

00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:44.160
representing the finite
[? length ?] sequence.

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:48.600
What all that boils down to
is the statement that in

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:53.090
discrete-time there really are
no convergence issues as there

00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:55.670
were in continuous-time.

00:19:55.670 --> 00:20:00.260
OK, well let's look at an
example of the Fourier series

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:03.390
representation for a
particular signal.

00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:06.420
And the one that I've picked
here is a simple one.

00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:14.430
Namely, a constant, a sine
term, and a cosine term.

00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:17.860
Now, for this particular
example, we can expand this

00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:22.720
out directly in terms of complex
exponentials and

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:26.710
essentially recognize this as a
sum of complex exponentials.

00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:33.370
It's examined in more detail
in Example 5.2 in the text.

00:20:33.370 --> 00:20:37.920
And if we look at the Fourier
series coefficients, we can

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:41.430
either look at it in terms of
real and imaginary parts or

00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:44.160
magnitude and angle.

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:48.260
On the left side here, I have
the real part of the Fourier

00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:50.150
coefficients.

00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:55.480
And let me draw your attention
to the fact that I've drawn

00:20:55.480 --> 00:21:01.330
this to specifically illuminate
the periodicity of

00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:04.360
the Fourier series coefficients
with a period of

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:05.570
capital N.

00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:08.740
So here are the Fourier
coefficients.

00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:12.920
And, in fact, it's this line
that represents the DC, or

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:17.510
constant term, and these two
lines that represent the

00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:19.160
cosine term.

00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:23.540
And of course, these are the
three terms that are required.

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:27.500
Or equivalently, this one,
this one, and this one.

00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:29.960
And then because of the
periodicity of the Fourier

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:34.140
series coefficients, this simply
periodically repeats.

00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:39.150
So here is the real part
and below it I show

00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:41.390
the imaginary part.

00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:45.560
And in the imaginary part,
incidentally let me draw your

00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:53.090
attention to the fact that it's
this term and this term

00:21:53.090 --> 00:21:56.760
in the imaginary part that
represent the sinusoid.

00:21:56.760 --> 00:22:00.280
Whereas it's the symmetric terms
in the real part the

00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:03.110
represent the cosine.

00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:07.580
OK, let's look at
another example.

00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:12.420
This is another example from the
text, and one that we'll

00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:18.000
be making frequent reference to
in this particular lecture.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:24.090
And what it is, is
a square wave.

00:22:24.090 --> 00:22:27.940
And I've expressed the Fourier
series coefficients, which are

00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:30.340
algebraically developed
in the text.

00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:35.000
I've expressed the Fourier
series coefficients as samples

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.616
of an envelope function.

00:22:38.616 --> 00:22:43.120
And so I've expressed it as
samples of this particular

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:46.120
function, which is referred
to as a sin

00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:49.020
nx over sin x function.

00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:52.850
And let me just compare it to
a continuous-time example,

00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:57.980
which is the continuous-time
square wave, where with the

00:22:57.980 --> 00:23:02.840
continuous-times square wave the
form of the Fourier series

00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:08.490
coefficients was as samples of
what we refer to as a sin x

00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:11.050
over x function.

00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:15.820
Now, the sin nx over sin x
function, which is the

00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:19.000
envelope of the Fourier series
coefficients for the

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:24.260
discrete-time periodic square
wave plays the role--

00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:26.490
and we'll see it very often
in discrete-time--

00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:31.080
that sin x over x does
in continuous-time.

00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:33.180
And, in fact, we should
understand right from the

00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:37.500
beginning that the sin x over
x envelope couldn't possibly

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:40.820
be the envelope of the
discrete-time Fourier series

00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:42.220
coefficients.

00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:47.600
And one obvious reason is
that it is not periodic.

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:50.540
What we require, of course, from
the discussion that I've

00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:53.530
just gone through is
periodicity of the

00:23:53.530 --> 00:23:54.340
coefficients.

00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:58.150
And then consequently, also
periodicity of the envelope in

00:23:58.150 --> 00:23:59.710
the discrete-time case.

00:23:59.710 --> 00:24:03.910
So once again, if we look back
at the algebraic expression

00:24:03.910 --> 00:24:08.440
that I have, it's samples of
the sin nx over sine x

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:13.130
function that represent the
Fourier series coefficients of

00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:16.160
this periodic square wave.

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:24.650
Now, in the representation in
the continuous-time case, we

00:24:24.650 --> 00:24:29.710
essentially had used the concept
of an envelope to

00:24:29.710 --> 00:24:33.320
represent the Fourier series
coefficients, and the notion

00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:35.990
that the Fourier series
coefficients were samples of

00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:36.710
an envelope.

00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:41.500
And that is the same notion
that we'll be using in

00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:43.110
discrete-time.

00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:49.560
So again for this square wave
example, then what we have is

00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:54.520
an envelope function, the sin
nx over sin x envelope

00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:59.720
function for a particular
value of the period.

00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:04.280
Here indicated with a period
of 10 samples.

00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:08.530
These samples of this envelope
function would then represent

00:25:08.530 --> 00:25:12.340
the Fourier series
coefficients.

00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:19.280
If we increased the period, then
we would simply have a

00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:23.910
finer spacing on the samples
of the envelope function to

00:25:23.910 --> 00:25:26.500
get the Fourier series
coefficients.

00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:32.380
And likewise, if we increase the
period still further, what

00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:37.260
we would have is an even
finer spacing.

00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:40.970
So actually, as the period
increases, and recall we used

00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:43.810
this in continuous-time also.

00:25:43.810 --> 00:25:47.700
As the period increases, we can
view the Fourier series

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:50.540
coefficients as samples
of an envelope.

00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:54.970
And as the period increases,
the sample spacing

00:25:54.970 --> 00:25:56.860
gets finer and finer.

00:25:56.860 --> 00:26:00.500
And in fact, as the period
goes off essentially to

00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:04.380
infinity, the samples of the
envelope, in effect, become

00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:06.140
the envelope.

00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:10.460
And recall also that this was
essentially the trick that we

00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:16.850
used in continuous-time to allow
us to develop or utilize

00:26:16.850 --> 00:26:21.590
the Fourier series to provide a
representation of aperiodic

00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:24.410
signals as a linear combination
of complex

00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:26.490
exponentials.

00:26:26.490 --> 00:26:35.220
In particular, what we did in
the continuous-time case when

00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:41.280
we had an aperiodic signal was
to consider constructing a

00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:44.500
periodic signal for which
the aperiodic

00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:47.110
signal was one period.

00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:52.200
And then we developed the notion
that since the periodic

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:58.310
signal has a Fourier series, and
since as the period of the

00:26:58.310 --> 00:27:02.760
periodic signal increases and
goes to infinity, the periodic

00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:06.520
signal represents the
aperiodic signal.

00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:09.930
Then, essentially, the Fourier
series provides us with a

00:27:09.930 --> 00:27:11.740
representation.

00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:14.770
Now, we can do exactly
the same thing in the

00:27:14.770 --> 00:27:16.420
discrete-time case.

00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:19.780
The statement is exactly the
same, except that in the

00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:24.530
discrete-time case, instead of t
as the independent variable,

00:27:24.530 --> 00:27:29.450
we simply make exactly the same
statement, but with our

00:27:29.450 --> 00:27:31.730
discrete-time variable n.

00:27:31.730 --> 00:27:37.560
So the basic notion then in
representing a discrete-time

00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:46.960
aperiodic signal is to first
construct a periodic signal.

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:50.450
Here we have the aperiodic
signal.

00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:54.340
We construct a periodic signal
by simply periodically

00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:58.840
replicating the aperiodic
signal.

00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:04.890
The periodic signal and the
aperiodic signal are identical

00:28:04.890 --> 00:28:07.310
for one period.

00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:12.120
And as the period goes off to
infinity, it's the Fourier

00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:16.810
series representation of the
periodic signal that provides

00:28:16.810 --> 00:28:21.050
a representation of the
aperiodic signal.

00:28:21.050 --> 00:28:30.450
Again, to return to the example
that we have been kind

00:28:30.450 --> 00:28:31.780
of working through
this lecture.

00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:34.730
Namely, the periodic
square wave.

00:28:34.730 --> 00:28:38.970
If we have an aperiodic signal,
which is a rectangle,

00:28:38.970 --> 00:28:42.330
and we construct a
periodic signal.

00:28:42.330 --> 00:28:44.130
And now we consider
letting this

00:28:44.130 --> 00:28:46.570
period increase to infinity.

00:28:46.570 --> 00:28:51.320
We would first have this set
of samples of the envelope.

00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:55.820
As the period increases, we
would decrease the sample

00:28:55.820 --> 00:28:58.660
spacing to this set
of samples.

00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:03.140
As the period increases further,
it would be this set

00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:04.970
of samples.

00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:08.850
And as the period goes off to
infinity, it's every point on

00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:10.050
the envelope.

00:29:10.050 --> 00:29:13.440
In fact, what the representation
of the

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:18.380
aperiodic signal is,
is the envelope.

00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:20.670
OK, well, so that's
the basic notion.

00:29:20.670 --> 00:29:23.650
It's no different than
what we did in the

00:29:23.650 --> 00:29:25.580
continuous-time case.

00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:30.770
And mathematically, it develops
in very much the same

00:29:30.770 --> 00:29:35.590
way as in the continuous-time
case.

00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:42.130
Specifically, here is our
representation through the

00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:47.550
Fourier series of the--

00:29:47.550 --> 00:29:51.760
here is a representation through
the envelope function.

00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:56.500
And this is the Fourier series
synthesis equation where the

00:29:56.500 --> 00:30:02.660
equation below tells us how we
get these Fourier coefficients

00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:05.970
or the envelope from x of n.

00:30:05.970 --> 00:30:08.860
Now, x tilde of n is the
periodic signal.

00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:11.990
And we know that over one
period, which is the only

00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:16.080
interval over which we use it,
in fact, this is identical to

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:17.980
the aperiodic signal.

00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:22.610
And so, in fact, we can rewrite
this equation simply

00:30:22.610 --> 00:30:27.630
by substituting in instead
of x tilde, the original

00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:29.540
aperiodic signal.

00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:33.950
And now we can use infinite
limits on this sum.

00:30:33.950 --> 00:30:38.180
And what we would want to
examine, mathematically, is

00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:46.950
what happens to the top equation
as we let the period

00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:49.250
go off to infinity?

00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:53.090
And what happens is exactly
identical, mathematically, to

00:30:53.090 --> 00:30:54.580
continuous-time.

00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:56.970
I won't belabor the details.

00:30:56.970 --> 00:31:01.980
Essentially it's this sum that
goes to an integral.

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:05.590
Omega 0, which is the
fundamental frequency, is

00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:06.940
going towards 0.

00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:10.100
In fact, becomes the
differential in the integral.

00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:13.200
And in the second equation,
of course, this then

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:15.210
becomes x of omega.

00:31:15.210 --> 00:31:19.980
And as N goes to infinity then,
what the Fourier series

00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:25.020
becomes is the Fourier transform
as summarized by the

00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:27.610
bottom two equations.

00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:33.490
So although there is a little
bit of mathematical trickery.

00:31:33.490 --> 00:31:36.900
Or let's not call it trickery,
but subtlety, to be tracked

00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:38.330
through in detail.

00:31:38.330 --> 00:31:43.300
The important conceptual thing
to think about is this notion

00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:46.760
that we take the aperiodic
signal, form a periodic

00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:49.230
signal, let the period
go off to infinity.

00:31:49.230 --> 00:31:52.920
In which case, the Fourier
series coefficients become

00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:54.630
these envelopes functions.

00:31:54.630 --> 00:31:56.910
And incidentally,
mathematically, one of the

00:31:56.910 --> 00:31:59.890
sums ends up going
to an integral.

00:31:59.890 --> 00:32:05.690
So what we have then is the
discrete-time Fourier

00:32:05.690 --> 00:32:11.210
transform, which is a
representation of

00:32:11.210 --> 00:32:13.080
an aperiodic signal.

00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:17.920
And we have the synthesis
equation, which I show as the

00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:21.470
top equation on this
transparency.

00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:27.940
And this is the integral that
the Fourier series synthesis

00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:32.800
equation went to as the period
went off to infinity.

00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:36.730
And we have the corresponding
analysis equation, which is

00:32:36.730 --> 00:32:41.180
shown below, where this tells
us the Fourier transform.

00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:44.890
In effect, the envelope or the
Fourier series coefficients of

00:32:44.890 --> 00:32:47.250
that periodic signal.

00:32:47.250 --> 00:32:53.550
And here represented in terms
of the aperiodic signal.

00:32:53.550 --> 00:32:56.215
So we have the analysis
equation

00:32:56.215 --> 00:32:58.710
and synthesis equation.

00:32:58.710 --> 00:33:03.160
There are a number of
things to focus on

00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:03.980
as you look at this.

00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:06.450
And we'll talk about some of its
properties actually in the

00:33:06.450 --> 00:33:07.150
next lecture.

00:33:07.150 --> 00:33:11.120
But some of the points that I'd
like you to think about

00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:16.700
and focus on is the fact that
now there is somewhat of an

00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:20.420
imbalance or lack of duality
between the time domain and

00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:21.890
frequency domain.

00:33:21.890 --> 00:33:24.530
x of n, which is our
aperiodic signal,

00:33:24.530 --> 00:33:27.350
is of course, discrete.

00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:32.100
It's Fourier transform, x of
omega, is a function of a

00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:33.320
continuous variable.

00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:36.870
Omega is a continuous
variable.

00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:41.420
That is essentially what
represents the envelope.

00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:46.060
Also, in the time domain
x of n is aperiodic.

00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:49.270
It's not a periodic function.

00:33:49.270 --> 00:33:52.440
However, in the frequency
domain, remember that the

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:55.960
Fourier series coefficients
were always periodic.

00:33:55.960 --> 00:34:00.090
Well, this envelope function
then is also periodic with a

00:34:00.090 --> 00:34:03.820
period in omega of 2 pi.

00:34:03.820 --> 00:34:07.820
Once again, the reason for the
periodicity, it all stems back

00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:12.449
to the fact that when we talk
about complex exponentials--

00:34:12.449 --> 00:34:15.199
and recall back to the
early lectures.

00:34:15.199 --> 00:34:19.300
In discrete-time, as the
frequency variable covers a

00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:25.980
range of 2 pi, when you proceed
past that range, you

00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:28.610
simply see the same complex
exponentials

00:34:28.610 --> 00:34:30.350
over and over again.

00:34:30.350 --> 00:34:33.300
And so obviously, anything that
we do with them would

00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:37.480
have to be periodic in that
frequency variable.

00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:42.480
All right, notationally, we'll,
again, represent the

00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:44.520
discrete-time Fourier
transform pair

00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:46.179
as I indicated here.

00:34:46.179 --> 00:34:49.980
And since it's a complex
function of frequency may, on

00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:54.530
occasion, want to either
represent it in rectangular

00:34:54.530 --> 00:34:59.180
form as I indicate in this
equation, or in polar form as

00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:02.040
I indicate in this equation.

00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:04.930
Let's look at an example.

00:35:04.930 --> 00:35:10.590
And, of course, one example that
we can look at is the one

00:35:10.590 --> 00:35:14.480
that has kind of been tracking
us through this lecture, which

00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:18.260
is the example of a rectangle.

00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:24.130
Now, the rectangle, if we refer
back to our argument of

00:35:24.130 --> 00:35:26.720
how we get a Fourier
representation for an

00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:30.550
aperiodic signal, we would form
a periodic signal where

00:35:30.550 --> 00:35:31.620
this is repeated.

00:35:31.620 --> 00:35:34.110
And that's our square
wave example.

00:35:34.110 --> 00:35:36.740
As the period goes to infinity,
the Fourier

00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:40.370
transform of this is represented
by the envelope of

00:35:40.370 --> 00:35:44.140
those Fourier series
coefficients, and that was our

00:35:44.140 --> 00:35:48.210
sin nx over sin x function,
which in this particular case,

00:35:48.210 --> 00:35:54.320
for these particular numbers, is
sin 5 omega over 2 divided

00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:57.890
by sin omega over 2.

00:35:57.890 --> 00:36:02.490
And notice, of course,
as we would expect--

00:36:02.490 --> 00:36:07.800
notice that this is a periodic
function of the frequency

00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:13.830
variable omega repeating, of
course, with a period of 2 pi.

00:36:13.830 --> 00:36:17.680
Whereas, in the time domain,
the function was not a

00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:19.020
periodic function,
it's aperiodic.

00:36:22.750 --> 00:36:26.170
Now, let's look at
another example.

00:36:26.170 --> 00:36:31.880
Let's look at an example which
is another signal that has

00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:34.780
kind of popped its head up
from time to time as the

00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:36.720
lectures have gone along.

00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:40.110
A signal which is another
aperiodic signal, which is a

00:36:40.110 --> 00:36:47.010
decaying exponential of this
form with the factor a chosen

00:36:47.010 --> 00:36:49.890
between 0 and 1.

00:36:49.890 --> 00:36:54.670
And you can work out the algebra
at your leisure.

00:36:54.670 --> 00:36:58.220
Basically, if we substitute
into the Fourier transform

00:36:58.220 --> 00:37:02.830
analysis equation, it's this
sum that we evaluate.

00:37:02.830 --> 00:37:07.665
Because we have a unit step here
which shuts this off for

00:37:07.665 --> 00:37:11.250
n less than 0, we can change
the limits on the sum.

00:37:11.250 --> 00:37:16.790
This then corresponds to the sum
over an infinite number of

00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:19.160
terms of a geometric series.

00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:23.690
And that, as we've seen before,
is 1 divided by 1

00:37:23.690 --> 00:37:27.340
minus a e to the
minus j omega.

00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:32.610
So let's look at what
that looks like.

00:37:32.610 --> 00:37:40.100
Here then we have, again, the
expression in the time domain

00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:43.330
and the expression in the
frequency domain.

00:37:43.330 --> 00:37:47.580
And let's, in particular, focus
on what the magnitude of

00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:49.960
the Fourier transform
looks like.

00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:54.790
It's as we show here.

00:37:54.790 --> 00:37:59.380
And for the particular values
of a that I pick, namely

00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:03.460
between 0 and 1, it's
larger at the origin

00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:05.340
than it is at pi.

00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:09.090
And then, of course,
it is periodic.

00:38:09.090 --> 00:38:12.080
And the periodicity is inherent
in the Fourier

00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:16.150
transform in discrete-time, so
we really might only need to

00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:21.160
look at this either from minus
pi to pi, or from 0 to 2 pi.

00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:24.710
The periodicity, of course,
would imply what the rest of

00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:27.900
this is for other
values of omega.

00:38:27.900 --> 00:38:31.290
Let me also draw your attention
while we're on it to

00:38:31.290 --> 00:38:33.900
the fact that--

00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:38.960
observe that if a were, in
fact, negative, then this

00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:42.700
value would be less
than this value.

00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:47.090
And in fact, for a negative, the
magnitude of the frequency

00:38:47.090 --> 00:38:51.630
response would look like this
except shifted by an amount in

00:38:51.630 --> 00:38:54.380
omega equal to pi.

00:38:54.380 --> 00:38:59.050
And this example will come up
and play an important role in

00:38:59.050 --> 00:39:03.650
our discussion next time, so
try to keep it in mind.

00:39:03.650 --> 00:39:06.710
And in fact, work it out
more carefully between

00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:08.220
now and next time.

00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:12.800
And also, if you have a chance,
focus on this issue of

00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:18.500
how it looks with a positive as
compared with a negative.

00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:23.860
Now, we developed the Fourier
transform by beginning with

00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:25.370
the Fourier series.

00:39:25.370 --> 00:39:29.350
We did that in continuous-time
also.

00:39:29.350 --> 00:39:32.920
What I'd like to do now, just as
we did in continuous-time,

00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:38.800
is now absorb the Fourier series
within the broader

00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:41.540
framework of the Fourier
transform.

00:39:41.540 --> 00:39:44.360
And there are two relationships
between the

00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:48.000
Fourier series and the Fourier
transform, which are identical

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:54.250
to relationships that we had in
the continuous-time case.

00:39:54.250 --> 00:40:00.980
Let me remind you that in
continuous-time we had the

00:40:00.980 --> 00:40:09.290
statement that if we have a
periodic signal, that in fact

00:40:09.290 --> 00:40:12.040
the Fourier series coefficients
of that periodic

00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:19.340
signal is proportional to
samples of the Fourier

00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:23.140
transform of one period.

00:40:23.140 --> 00:40:28.510
Well, in fact, let me remind you
flows easily from all the

00:40:28.510 --> 00:40:33.210
things that we built up so far,
because of the fact that

00:40:33.210 --> 00:40:36.670
the Fourier transform
essentially, by definition, of

00:40:36.670 --> 00:40:44.600
the way we developed it, is
what we get as the Fourier

00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:48.780
series coefficients, as we focus
on one period, and then

00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:51.050
let the period go
off to infinity.

00:40:51.050 --> 00:40:55.510
Well, looking at one period, the
Fourier transform of that

00:40:55.510 --> 00:40:59.490
then is the envelope of the
Fourier series coefficients.

00:40:59.490 --> 00:41:05.610
And so in continuous-time, we
have this relationship.

00:41:05.610 --> 00:41:10.500
And in discrete-time, we
have precisely the same

00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:16.240
relationship, except that here
we're talking about an integer

00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:20.090
variable as opposed to the
continuous variable, and a

00:41:20.090 --> 00:41:28.440
period of capital N as opposed
to a period of t0.

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:38.720
OK, so once again, if we return
to our example, or if

00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:40.790
we return to a periodic
signal.

00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:46.240
If we have a periodic signal
and we consider the Fourier

00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:52.100
transform of one period, the
Fourier series coefficients of

00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:56.880
this periodic signal are,
in fact, samples--

00:41:56.880 --> 00:42:01.800
as stated mathematically in the
bottom equation, samples

00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:07.340
of the Fourier transform
of one period.

00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:11.180
So x of omega is the Fourier
transform of one period.

00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:13.760
a sub k's are the Fourier series
coefficients of the

00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:15.350
periodic signal.

00:42:15.350 --> 00:42:19.190
And this relationship simply
says they're related except

00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:23.030
for scale factor through
samples along

00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:25.820
the frequency axis.

00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:33.370
And, of course, we saw this
in the context of

00:42:33.370 --> 00:42:36.350
our square wave example.

00:42:36.350 --> 00:42:42.080
In the square wave example, we
have a periodic signal, which

00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:45.690
is a periodic square wave.

00:42:45.690 --> 00:42:51.800
And the Fourier transform
of one period, in fact,

00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:54.790
represents the envelope.

00:42:54.790 --> 00:42:57.180
And here we have the
envelope function.

00:42:57.180 --> 00:43:02.520
Represents the envelope of the
Fourier series coefficients.

00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:05.710
And the Fourier series
coefficients are samples.

00:43:08.390 --> 00:43:14.460
So what we have then is a
relationship back to the

00:43:14.460 --> 00:43:18.120
Fourier series coefficients
from the Fourier transform

00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:21.750
that tells us that for a
periodic signal now, the

00:43:21.750 --> 00:43:23.420
periodic signal--

00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:27.170
the Fourier series coefficients
are related, are

00:43:27.170 --> 00:43:31.920
samples of the Fourier transform
of one period.

00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:36.830
Now, finally, to kind of bring
things back in a circle and

00:43:36.830 --> 00:43:40.100
exactly identical to what we
did in the continuous-time

00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:46.400
case, we can finally absorb
the Fourier series in

00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:47.310
discrete-time.

00:43:47.310 --> 00:43:50.480
We can absorb it into
the framework

00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:53.300
of the Fourier transform.

00:43:53.300 --> 00:44:00.800
Now, remember or recall how we
did that when we tried to do a

00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:04.970
similar sort of thing
in continuous-time.

00:44:04.970 --> 00:44:11.430
In continuous-time, what we
essentially did is to develop

00:44:11.430 --> 00:44:15.040
that, more or less,
by definition.

00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:18.150
We have a periodic signal.

00:44:18.150 --> 00:44:20.800
The periodic signal is
represented through a Fourier

00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:24.360
series and Fourier series
coefficients.

00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:27.570
Essentially what I pointed
out at that time

00:44:27.570 --> 00:44:30.180
was that if we define--

00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:33.780
take it as a definition, the
Fourier transform of the

00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:39.220
periodic signal as an impulse
train where the amplitudes of

00:44:39.220 --> 00:44:42.640
the impulses are proportional
to the Fourier series

00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:44.680
coefficients.

00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:50.430
If we take that impulse train
representation and simply plug

00:44:50.430 --> 00:44:58.460
it into the Fourier transform
synthesis equation, what we

00:44:58.460 --> 00:45:04.860
end up with is the Fourier
series synthesis equation.

00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:17.320
So in continuous-time, we had
used this definition of the

00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:20.060
continuous-time Fourier
transform

00:45:20.060 --> 00:45:22.610
of a periodic signal.

00:45:22.610 --> 00:45:27.670
And again, in discrete-time,
it's simply a matter of using

00:45:27.670 --> 00:45:30.110
exactly the same expression.

00:45:30.110 --> 00:45:35.400
And using, instead, the
appropriate variables related

00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:38.430
to discrete-time rather than
the variables related to

00:45:38.430 --> 00:45:39.810
continuous-time.

00:45:39.810 --> 00:45:43.120
So in discrete-time, if we have
a periodic signal, the

00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:47.150
Fourier transform of that
periodic signal is defined as

00:45:47.150 --> 00:45:53.290
an impulse train where the
amplitudes of the impulses are

00:45:53.290 --> 00:45:57.500
proportional to the Fourier
series coefficients.

00:45:57.500 --> 00:46:00.660
If this expression is
substituted into the synthesis

00:46:00.660 --> 00:46:05.340
equation for the Fourier
transform, that will simply

00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:08.440
then reduce to the synthesis
equation

00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:11.240
for the Fourier series.

00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:17.310
So once more returning to our
example, which is the square

00:46:17.310 --> 00:46:19.170
wave example that we've
carried through these

00:46:19.170 --> 00:46:23.780
lectures, or through this
lecture, we can see that

00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:25.870
really what we're talking
about really is

00:46:25.870 --> 00:46:27.120
a notational change.

00:46:30.740 --> 00:46:35.290
Here is the periodic signal and
below it are the Fourier

00:46:35.290 --> 00:46:39.330
series coefficients, where
I've removed the envelope

00:46:39.330 --> 00:46:43.420
function and just indicate the
amplitudes of the coefficients

00:46:43.420 --> 00:46:46.610
indexed, of course, on the
coefficient number.

00:46:46.610 --> 00:46:49.550
And so this represents
a bar graph.

00:46:49.550 --> 00:46:52.760
And if instead of talking
about the Fourier series

00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:59.040
coefficients, what I want to
talk about is the Fourier

00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:03.300
transform, the Fourier
transform, in essence,

00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:08.450
corresponds to simply redrawing
that using impulses

00:47:08.450 --> 00:47:14.420
and using an axis that is
essentially indexed on the

00:47:14.420 --> 00:47:18.910
fundamental frequency omega 0,
rather than on the Fourier

00:47:18.910 --> 00:47:20.433
series coefficient number k.

00:47:23.884 --> 00:47:31.540
OK, so to summarize,
what we've done is

00:47:31.540 --> 00:47:34.190
to pretty much parallel--

00:47:34.190 --> 00:47:38.290
somewhat more quickly, the kind
of development that we

00:47:38.290 --> 00:47:41.970
went through for continuous-time
representation

00:47:41.970 --> 00:47:45.070
through complex exponentials,
paralleled that for the

00:47:45.070 --> 00:47:47.390
discrete-time case.

00:47:47.390 --> 00:47:51.340
And pretty much the conceptual
underpinnings of the

00:47:51.340 --> 00:47:55.230
development are identical
in discrete-time and in

00:47:55.230 --> 00:47:56.480
continuous-time.

00:47:58.750 --> 00:48:04.510
We saw that there are some
major differences, or

00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:06.700
important differences between
continuous-time and

00:48:06.700 --> 00:48:08.560
discrete-time.

00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:11.240
And the difference, essentially

00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:14.080
relates to two aspects.

00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:18.790
One aspect is the fact that in
discrete-time, we have a

00:48:18.790 --> 00:48:22.690
discrete representation in the
time domain, whereas the

00:48:22.690 --> 00:48:25.020
independent variable in the
frequency domain is a

00:48:25.020 --> 00:48:26.750
continuous variable.

00:48:26.750 --> 00:48:30.860
Whereas in continuous-time for
the Fourier transform, we had

00:48:30.860 --> 00:48:35.120
a duality between the time
domain and frequency domain.

00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:38.170
The other very important
difference tied back to the

00:48:38.170 --> 00:48:41.310
difference between complex
exponentials, continuous-time

00:48:41.310 --> 00:48:43.050
and discrete-time.

00:48:43.050 --> 00:48:45.980
In continuous-time, complex
exponentials, as you vary the

00:48:45.980 --> 00:48:52.940
frequency, generate distinct
time functions.

00:48:52.940 --> 00:48:56.500
In discrete-time, as you vary
the frequency, once you've

00:48:56.500 --> 00:49:01.120
covered a frequency interval of
2 pi, then you've seen all

00:49:01.120 --> 00:49:02.240
the ones there are to see.

00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:03.680
There are no more.

00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:09.610
And this, in effect, imposes a
periodicity on the Fourier

00:49:09.610 --> 00:49:13.390
domain representation of
discrete-time signals.

00:49:13.390 --> 00:49:15.710
And some of those differences
and, of course, lots of the

00:49:15.710 --> 00:49:20.380
similarities will surface,
both as we use this

00:49:20.380 --> 00:49:26.120
representation and as we develop
further properties.

00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:30.290
In the next lecture, what
we'll do is to focus in,

00:49:30.290 --> 00:49:33.540
again, on the Fourier transform,
the discrete-time

00:49:33.540 --> 00:49:39.050
Fourier transform, develop
or illuminate some of the

00:49:39.050 --> 00:49:42.770
properties of the Fourier
transform, and then see how

00:49:42.770 --> 00:49:46.850
these properties can be used
for a number of things.

00:49:46.850 --> 00:49:49.360
For example, how the properties
as they were in

00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:55.280
continuous-time can be used to
efficiently generate the

00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:58.430
solution and analyze linear
constant coefficient

00:49:58.430 --> 00:49:59.950
difference equations.

00:49:59.950 --> 00:50:03.680
And then beyond that, the
concepts of filtering and

00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:05.090
modulation.

00:50:05.090 --> 00:50:09.220
And both the properties and
interpretation, which will

00:50:09.220 --> 00:50:12.750
very strongly parallel the kinds
of developments along

00:50:12.750 --> 00:50:14.650
those lines that we did
in the last lecture.

00:50:14.650 --> 00:50:15.900
Thank you.
