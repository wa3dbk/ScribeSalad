00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.190
PROFESSOR: In this lecture we
begin a discussion of the

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.860
topic of modulation, which is,
among other things, a very

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.160
important topic in
practical terms.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.400
For example, it forms the
cornerstone for many

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.280
communication systems.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.290
And also, as we'll see as these
lectures go along, a

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.380
particular form of modulation
referred to as pulse amplitude

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.350
modulation, and eventually
impulse modulation or impulse

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.930
train modulation, forms a very
important bridge between

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.670
continuous time signals and
discrete time signals.

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.590
Now in general terms what
we mean when we refer to

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.280
modulation is the notion of
using one signal to vary a

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.110
parameter of another signal.

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.510
For example, a sinusoidal signal
has three parameters,

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.520
amplitude, frequency,
and phase.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.920
And we could think, for example,
of using one signal

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.080
to vary, let's say,
the amplitude of

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.730
a sinusoidal signal.

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:08.259
And what that leads to is a
notion, which we'll develop in

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.300
some detail, referred to
as sinusoidal amplitude

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.780
modulation, and would correspond
to a sinusoidal

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.670
signal, referred to as the
carrier, and it's amplitude

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.700
being varied on the basis
of another signal.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.800
Now alternatively we could think
of varying either the

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.790
frequency or the phase of a
sinusoidal signal, again with

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.200
another signal.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.850
And what that leads to is
another very important notion,

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.480
which is referred to sinusoidal
frequency

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.850
modulation, where essentially
it's the frequency of a

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.850
sinusoid that's changing
depending on the signal that's

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.460
we're using to modulate
the sinusoid.

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:03.200
Now sinusoidal amplitude,
frequency, and phase

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.950
modulation are extremely
important topics and ideas in

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.570
the context of communication
systems.

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.800
One of the reasons is that if
you want to transmit a signal,

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.880
let's say for example a voice
signal, the voice signal that

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.980
you're listening to now.

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.320
If you try to transmit that over
long distances, because

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.740
of the frequencies involved
the medium that you use to

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.530
transmit it won't carry
it long distances.

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.030
The idea then is to essentially
take that signal,

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.760
like a voice signal, use
it to modulate a much

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.980
higher-frequency signal,
and then transmit that

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.510
higher-frequency signal over a
medium that essentially can

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.060
support long-distance
transmission at those

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.420
frequencies.

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.240
Then at the other end of course,
the voice information,

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:57.480
or whatever else the information
is, is taken off.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.370
Now also, a notion that that
leads to, and we'll be

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:06.140
developing in some detail,
is the idea that you can

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:11.940
simultaneously transmit more
than one signal by in essence

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.000
taking several voice signals or
other signals, using them

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.279
to modulate either the frequency
or amplitude of

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:23.750
sinusoidal signals at different
frequencies, adding

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:24.940
all those together--

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.330
that's a process called
multiplexing--

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.040
and then at the other end of
the transmission system,

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.570
taking those sinusoidal
signals apart.

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:37.610
And then extracting the
envelope or frequency

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.910
modulation information to get
back to the voice signal or

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.630
other information-carrying
signal.

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:50.420
So that's one of the very
important ways in which

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:54.670
sinusoidal modulation is used
in communication systems.

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:59.100
And what we'll see, in
particular as we go through

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:04.980
today's lecture, is that
sinusoidal amplitude

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:10.630
modulation, follows in a fairly
straightforward way

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:14.250
from the properties of the
Fourier transform that we've

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.920
developed in some of the
earlier lectures.

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:22.520
So our focus in today's lecture
will be on sinusoidal

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.580
amplitude modulation
in continuous time.

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.740
In the next lecture we'll
consider the same set of

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.950
notions related to discrete
time, and also a concept

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:36.040
referred to as pulse amplitude
modulation.

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:39.690
And all of these follow, in a
very straightforward way, from

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:43.470
the modulation property for
the Fourier transform.

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:47.460
Issues of frequency and phase
modulation are a little more

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:48.760
difficult to analyze.

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.570
But many of the techniques that
we've developed in the

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:57.190
previous lectures also provide
important insights into

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:58.930
frequency and phase
modulation.

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:04.060
And some of this is developed
in more detail in the book.

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:09.050
So what I'd like to do is focus,
for now, on the concept

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:12.520
of amplitude modulation.

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:18.270
And as I indicated, there are
several kinds of carrier

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:22.010
signals on which the
modulation can be

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:23.460
superimposed.

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:27.230
The basic structure for an
amplitude modulation system is

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:30.870
one in which there is the
modulating signal, let's say

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:34.400
for example, voice, and a
carrier signal-- what's

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.560
referred to as the carrier.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.550
And then of course the resulting
output is the

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:41.640
modulated output.

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:45.890
Now to analyze this, since we
have multiplication in the

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:49.350
time domain, we know from the
property of the Fourier

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:51.920
transform that we've developed
previously--

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.750
the modulation property--

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:57.900
that multiplication in the time
domain corresponds to

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:00.550
convolution in the
frequency domain.

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:04.890
And it's this basic property
or equation that lets us

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:09.420
analyze, in some detail in fact,
the notions of amplitude

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:11.590
modulation.

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:15.240
As we go through this lecture
and the next lecture, we'll be

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:18.920
talking, as I indicated, about
several different types of

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.700
carrier signals.

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:24.910
One is what's referred
to as pulse carriers.

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:28.390
And that leads to, among other
things, the concept of pulse

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:30.220
amplitude modulation.

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:34.050
That will be deferred until
the next lecture.

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:39.720
In today's lecture what I'll
focus on is first, the case of

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:43.240
a complex exponential carrier,
second, the case

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.210
of sinusoidal carrier.

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:48.490
And in fact the complex
exponential carrier and

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:51.770
sinusoidal carrier are obviously
very closely

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:56.710
related, since the complex
exponential carrier is, in

00:07:56.710 --> 00:08:00.350
effect, two sinusoidal
carriers.

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:04.900
One for the real part and one
for the imaginary part.

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:08.700
So let's first begin the
discussion of amplitude

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:12.840
modulation by considering a
complex exponential carrier,

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:14.900
and then moving on to
a discussion of

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:18.490
a sinusoidal carrier.

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:26.930
So the issue then is that we
have a signal, x of t.

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:29.060
It's multiplied by a carrier.

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:31.860
And the carrier that we're
considering is a carrier

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:39.919
signal, c of t, of the form
e to the j omega c t

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:42.030
plus theta sub c.

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:45.430
That's the form of our
carrier signal.

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:52.110
And what we can first analyze
is what the resulting signal

00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:55.870
or spectrum is at the output
of the modulator.

00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:59.870
Well, we can do that by
concentrating on the

00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:01.650
modulation property.

00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:06.820
And let's consider, just as a
general form for a spectrum,

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:14.220
what I've indicated here for the
Fourier transform of the

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:18.260
input signal or modulating
signal, X of omega.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:22.650
And so this is intended
to represent the

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:25.760
spectrum of x of t.

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:29.140
And then the carrier signal,
since it's a single complex

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:35.340
exponential, has a Fourier
transform which is an impulse

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:37.300
in the frequency domain.

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:42.450
And the amplitude of the impulse
is 2 pi e to the j

00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:46.310
theta sub c, where we notice
that the complex amplitude

00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:50.110
incorporates the phase
information.

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:54.690
So now if we multiply in the
time domain, we convolve in

00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:55.920
the frequency domain.

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:59.850
And as you know, convolving a
signal with an impulse just

00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:03.380
shifts that signal to the
location of the impulse.

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:07.400
And so as a consequence of
taking care of various

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:13.250
factors, what we end up with is
a spectrum that is centered

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:18.660
at the carrier frequency
omega sub c.

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:25.330
So what this says is that if we
have a signal, x of t, and

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:31.040
we use it to modulate a complex
exponential carrier in

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:34.570
the frequency domain, what we've
simply done is to take

00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:39.760
the original spectrum and
shift it in frequency.

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:43.340
So that what was originally at
zero frequency is now centered

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:44.590
around the carrier frequency.

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:50.160
We've now modulated, in effect,
to a higher frequency.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:53.180
Things are happening in a
higher-frequency band.

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:57.200
And the next question is, how do
we demodulate, or in other

00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:02.540
words, how do we get the
original signal back?

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:05.210
Of course one way that we
can think of doing it,

00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:09.790
particularly in the context of
this specific carrier, if we

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:14.660
look back at the top equation we
have, as the result of the

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:19.470
modulation, x of t times c of
t, where c of t is this.

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:24.370
And we could consider, for
example, just simply dividing

00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:26.530
the modulator output by this.

00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:29.790
Or equivalently, taking the
modulated output and

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:37.170
multiplying by e to the minus
j omega c t plus theta c.

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:40.790
Let's track that through in
terms of the spectra.

00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:46.020
We have, again, the spectrum
of the output of the

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:49.130
modulator, which is the original
spectrum shifted up

00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:51.530
to the carrier frequency.

00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:58.130
We have, below that, the
spectrum of e to the minus j

00:11:58.130 --> 00:12:01.050
omega c t plus theta c.

00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:06.440
And if we now convolve this
with this, that results in

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:09.300
simply shifting this spectrum--
except for an issue

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:10.750
of a scale factor--

00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:14.430
shifting this spectrum back
down to the origin.

00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:17.560
So convolving these two
together, the spectrum that we

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:20.740
end up with is that.

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:25.370
So we can track this through
in the frequency domain.

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:28.900
In the frequency domain it says
shift the spectrum up.

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:32.430
When you want to demodulate,
shift the spectrum back down.

00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:35.780
And alternatively, we can look
at it algebraically in the

00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:36.320
time domain.

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:40.010
And what it says is, if you
multiply by e to the plus j

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:44.150
omega c t, then when you want to
get back, multiply by e to

00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:46.920
the minus j omega c t.

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:51.280
Now one question that you could
conceivably be asking

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:55.730
is, if we're talking about
practical systems and not

00:12:55.730 --> 00:13:01.890
simply mathematics, does it make
sense in the real world

00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:06.530
to consider using a complex
exponential carrier?

00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:11.300
And the answer to that,
in fact, is yes.

00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:16.460
That very often in practical
systems one considers using a

00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:20.640
carrier which in fact is
a complex exponential.

00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:22.890
Well, a complex exponential
is complex.

00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:25.440
There's a square root of
minus one in there.

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:27.590
And you could ask well,
how do we get a square

00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:29.170
root of minus one?

00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:31.970
And the answer is
fairly simple.

00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:37.030
Let's look again at the
modulator, which we have here.

00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:40.980
And in effect, what that says
is we want to multiply a

00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:45.840
real-valued signal by e to the
j omega c t plus theta c.

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:51.030
Now, we can equivalently use
Euler's relationship to break

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:54.650
this down into a cosine
and sine term.

00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:57.660
And so what that means in terms
of an implementation,

00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:07.140
equivalently, is modulating x
of t onto a cosine carrier.

00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:10.850
And that then gives
us the real part

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:12.830
of the complex output.

00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:17.780
And modulating it onto a
sinusoidal carrier--

00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:20.340
these two being 90 degrees
out of phase--

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:23.500
and that gives us the
imaginary part.

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:27.010
And so in effect, this is
the complex signal.

00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:30.440
If we just simply think of
hanging a tag on here that

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:34.500
says square root of minus 1,
or j, and we appropriately

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:38.210
combine complex signals
following the rules of complex

00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:39.110
arithmetic.

00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:42.020
And indeed, that's exactly the
way things are done in the

00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:43.010
real world.

00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:48.660
A complex signal is simply a
set of two real signals.

00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:54.220
And of course, if we look at the
spectra involved, we have

00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:56.690
here the real part and
the imaginary part

00:14:56.690 --> 00:14:59.990
of the complex output.

00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:05.330
If we again refer back to the
original spectrum, X of omega,

00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:10.580
and the modulated spectrum which
I show down here, the

00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:16.030
original spectrum shifted up
to the carrier frequency.

00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:20.610
In effect we're building
this out of two lines.

00:15:20.610 --> 00:15:25.870
One line representing the
real part of that.

00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:29.610
And the real part in the time
domain corresponds to the even

00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:31.290
part in the frequency domain.

00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:37.680
And so with the output of the
cosine modulator, we have a

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:40.750
spectrum that looks like this.

00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:47.120
And the output along the
imaginary branch has a

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:50.310
spectrum that looks like this.

00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:54.690
Recall in the top branch that
this, for positive frequencies

00:15:54.690 --> 00:15:57.210
was positive, and was
positive here.

00:15:57.210 --> 00:16:00.260
And so in effect when you add
them, this portion of the

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.490
spectrum will cancel out.

00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:10.360
So in effect, what we're doing
is building the complex signal

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:11.850
out of two real signals.

00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:16.710
Or we're building the spectrum
of the complex signal out of

00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:20.745
separate lines that represent
the even and the odd parts.

00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:29.640
Now, there are lots of
applications of amplitude

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:30.910
modulation.

00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:33.390
And we'll be seeing a number of
these as we go through the

00:16:33.390 --> 00:16:34.420
discussion.

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:39.660
What I'd like to do is just
indicate briefly one now,

00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:44.560
which is an application that in
fact surfaces fairly often

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:49.540
in the context of a complex
exponential carrier.

00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:58.440
And that is the notion of using
modulation to permit the

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:03.550
application of a very well
designed and implemented

00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:08.240
low-pass filter to be used as
a band-pass filter and in

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:10.520
fact, as a set of band-pass
filters.

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:11.680
And here's the idea.

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:18.230
The idea is if we have
a fixed filter--

00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:19.990
let's say we have a signal.

00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:24.359
And we want to think of a
filter, which we want to move

00:17:24.359 --> 00:17:28.640
along the signal, one way to
do it is to somehow have

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:30.950
filters that move along
the signal.

00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:34.870
The other possibility is to keep
the filter fixed and let

00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:39.250
the signal move in frequency
in front of the filter.

00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:42.540
Let me be a little
more specific.

00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:47.860
Suppose that we have
a signal, x of t.

00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:52.500
And we modulate it with a
complex exponential carrier

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:56.490
with a carrier frequency,
omega c.

00:17:56.490 --> 00:18:01.020
And the output of that is then
processed with a low-pass

00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:06.910
filter and then we demodulate
the result.

00:18:06.910 --> 00:18:12.770
Then what we've done is to take
the spectrum of the input

00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:18.440
signal, shift it, pull out
what is now around low

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:22.200
frequencies, and then shift that
part of the spectrum back

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:24.190
to where it belongs.

00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:28.900
So if we look at that in terms
of actually tracking through

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:34.180
the spectra, we would have
initially a spectrum for the

00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:40.050
original signal, which I show
at the top as X of omega.

00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:44.750
After modulating or shifting
that spectrum up to a center

00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:49.530
frequency of omega c, we then
have what I indicate here.

00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:53.490
And the dotted line corresponds
to the pass band

00:18:53.490 --> 00:18:55.430
of the low-pass filter.

00:18:55.430 --> 00:19:00.590
Well, the result of low-pass
filtering rejects all the

00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:04.970
spectrum except the part
around low frequencies.

00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:10.260
And the next step is then
to demodulate this.

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:14.640
And so in effect, demodulating
will shift this spectrum back

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:17.490
to where it originally
came from.

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:22.710
And so that result will be
what I show in the final

00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:25.680
result, which is here.

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:31.140
And what we can see is that
this is equivalent.

00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:36.170
If we can look back at the top
spectrum, this is equivalent

00:19:36.170 --> 00:19:41.070
to having extracted, with a
band-pass filter, a section

00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:43.860
out of this part of
the spectrum.

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:47.840
So in terms of tracking through
the spectrum and

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:54.240
looking at the equivalent
filtering operation, then what

00:19:54.240 --> 00:20:00.470
we accomplished was to pull out
this part of the spectrum

00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:03.950
using a low-pass filter
and modulation.

00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:07.770
But equivalently what we
implemented was a band-pass

00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:10.750
filter as I indicated here.

00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:14.030
Now of course, a signal with
this spectrum, since the

00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:17.030
spectrum is not conjugate
symmetric, we know that this

00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:20.620
signal does not correspond
to a real-valued signal.

00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:24.400
Equivalently this filter doesn't
correspond to a filter

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:26.990
whose impulse response
is real.

00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:32.140
If we add another step to this,
which is to take the

00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:36.290
real part of the output, then by
taking the real part of the

00:20:36.290 --> 00:20:40.550
output we would be taking the
even part of the spectrum

00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:43.080
associated with that
complex signal.

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:47.860
And the equivalent filter that
we would end up with then is

00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:52.250
the filter that I indicate
at the bottom, which is a

00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:54.950
band-pass filter.

00:20:54.950 --> 00:21:00.750
Now just to reiterate a point
that I made earlier.

00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:03.860
A question, of course, is why
would you go to this trouble?

00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:06.520
Why not just build a
band-pass filter?

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:13.300
And one of the reasons is that
it's often much easier to

00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:17.920
build a fixed filter, a filter
with a fixed-center frequency,

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:21.680
for example a low-pass filter,
than it is to build a filter

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:25.030
that has variable components
in it so that when you vary

00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:28.920
them the filter's center
frequency shifts around.

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:31.880
Now, if you want to look at
the energy in a signal in

00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:35.450
different frequency bands, then
you'd like to look at it

00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:37.660
through different filters.

00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:41.390
And so the idea here, which is
really the basis for many

00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:45.810
spectrum analyzers, is to build
a really good quality

00:21:45.810 --> 00:21:50.320
low-pass filter and then use
modulation, which is often

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:51.260
easier to implement.

00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:56.470
Use modulation to shift the
signal essentially in front of

00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:57.720
the filter.

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:05.600
So we've worked our way through
modulation with a

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:08.350
complex exponential carrier.

00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:13.090
And what we saw, among other
things with a complex

00:22:13.090 --> 00:22:17.340
exponential carrier,
is that what it

00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:23.260
corresponds to is two branches.

00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:28.130
One being modulation with
a cosine, and the other,

00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:29.570
modulation with a sine.

00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:34.340
And so in the real world, or
in a practical system,

00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:37.610
modulation of the complex
exponential carrier really

00:22:37.610 --> 00:22:41.930
would be accomplished with
modulation with a sinusoidal

00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:47.330
carrier, and in particular with
sinusoidal carriers that

00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:50.660
are in quadrature, as it's
referred to, or equivalently

00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:54.170
90 degrees out of phase.

00:22:54.170 --> 00:23:00.750
Well, in fact sinusoidal
modulation, in other words,

00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:04.970
modulation using only a
sinusoidal carrier, very often

00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:10.020
is used in its own right not
only for generating a complex

00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:17.060
exponential carrier, but
as a carrier by itself.

00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:21.370
Let's look at what the
consequences of modulation

00:23:21.370 --> 00:23:23.500
with a sinusoidal carrier are.

00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:26.830
And in particular work through,
again, what the

00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:32.410
spectra are and how we get the
original signal back again.

00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:39.150
So we are talking about a
carrier signal which is simply

00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:42.920
a sinusoidal signal
with some phase.

00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:48.650
And of course we can write that
as the sum of two complex

00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:51.460
exponential signals.

00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:56.500
And so now, when we apply the
modulation property we have

00:23:56.500 --> 00:24:01.190
the original spectrum, which
I show here, X of omega.

00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:05.340
And that's convolved with the
spectrum of the carrier.

00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:07.310
And the spectrum of the
carrier, in this

00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:10.520
case, is two impulses.

00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:16.270
One at plus omega c, and
one at minus omega c.

00:24:16.270 --> 00:24:19.510
And the amplitudes of these
incorporate the phase.

00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:25.620
And later on in the lecture,
and in subsequent lectures,

00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:30.500
I'll have a tendency to drop the
theta sub c, just to keep

00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:33.820
the notation and algebra a
little cleaner, but for now

00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:35.340
I've incorporated it.

00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:41.040
And so now when we apply the
modulation property, what we

00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:46.270
will do is convolve this
spectrum with this spectrum,

00:24:46.270 --> 00:24:50.060
and the result is that the
spectrum of the original

00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:55.690
signal gets replicated at
both omega sub c and at

00:24:55.690 --> 00:24:57.460
minus omega sub c.

00:24:57.460 --> 00:25:00.800
And the resulting spectrum at
the output of the modulator,

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:03.540
then, is the spectrum
that I show here.

00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:09.930
Now the question,
of course, is--

00:25:09.930 --> 00:25:12.990
so now what's happened is that
with a sinusoidal carrier,

00:25:12.990 --> 00:25:16.710
we've moved the spectrum
to both plus omega c

00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:18.870
and minus omega c.

00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:22.570
And now if we want to get the
original signal back again,

00:25:22.570 --> 00:25:26.480
what we would like to do somehow
is move that spectrum

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:29.500
back down to the origin.

00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:32.050
Now in the case of a complex
exponential,

00:25:32.050 --> 00:25:33.020
that was easy to do.

00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:35.910
We'd shifted one up, we'd
just shift it back down.

00:25:35.910 --> 00:25:41.320
Let's see what happens if we
attempt to demodulate by again

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:45.960
multiplying by the same
sinusoidal carrier.

00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:55.690
So let's examine what happens
if we now take our modulated

00:25:55.690 --> 00:26:03.600
signal and, again, modulate it
onto the same sinusoidal

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:08.010
carrier to generate
the output w of t.

00:26:08.010 --> 00:26:14.340
If we look at the spectra, we
have the modulated spectrum

00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:16.940
which we had initially.

00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:21.300
And we now want to convolve
that, again, with the spectrum

00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:23.470
of the carrier signal.

00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:26.840
The spectrum of the carrier
signal, I indicate here.

00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:30.350
And if you track through the
convolution, which is fairly

00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:34.870
straightforward, then what
happens as you convolve this

00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:43.270
with this is you end up with a
composite spectrum, which is

00:26:43.270 --> 00:26:48.730
what I've indicated on the
bottom curve, and has the

00:26:48.730 --> 00:26:52.990
spectrum of the original signal,
x of t, replicated in

00:26:52.990 --> 00:26:54.220
three places.

00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:58.920
One is at minus 2 omega sub c.

00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:00.960
One is around the origin.

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:05.980
And one is shifted up to twice
the carrier frequency.

00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:08.150
Well it's this piece
that we want.

00:27:08.150 --> 00:27:12.480
If we could eliminate everything
else and keep this,

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:18.360
then that would correspond to
the spectrum of the original

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:20.020
signal, x of t.

00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:21.410
How do we do that?

00:27:21.410 --> 00:27:26.870
Well, we know how to eliminate
part of the spectrum and keep

00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:27.990
another part of the spectrum.

00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:29.320
That's called filtering.

00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:35.440
So what we would do is put the
result of this through a

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:37.035
low-pass filter.

00:27:37.035 --> 00:27:39.480
The low-pass filter route would
retain the part of the

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:44.720
spectrum around DC and eliminate
the remaining part

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:45.330
of the spectrum.

00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:49.090
So we would keep this part and
eliminate the part of the

00:27:49.090 --> 00:27:51.410
spectrum that we
have over here.

00:27:51.410 --> 00:27:54.490
And let me just draw your
attention to the fact that,

00:27:54.490 --> 00:27:59.190
because of the way the algebra
works out, the amplitude of

00:27:59.190 --> 00:28:01.950
this replication of the spectrum
is half what the

00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:04.320
original spectrum was.

00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:09.660
And that means that ideally, to
keep scale factors correct,

00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:14.890
we would choose the amplitude of
this to be 2, to scale this

00:28:14.890 --> 00:28:18.150
back up to 1.

00:28:18.150 --> 00:28:23.140
So what we have is the modulator
and demodulator.

00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:30.010
And just to summarize, for the
case of a sinusoidal carrier

00:28:30.010 --> 00:28:33.860
as opposed to a complex
exponential carrier, the

00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:39.060
modulator is just as it is in
the complex exponential case.

00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:44.560
It's multiplication with the
sinusoidal carrier, with

00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:47.190
frequency, omega c, and
phase, theta sub c.

00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:57.740
In the demodulator we would
take the modulated signal,

00:28:57.740 --> 00:29:00.820
modulate it again with the
same carrier signal--

00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:03.740
and as we'll see later, it's
important to keep the same

00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:06.100
phase relationship.

00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:11.870
This result is not yet quite
the demodulated signal.

00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:17.090
We need to process that with a
low-pass filter that extracts

00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:21.550
the part of the spectrum around
DC and throws away the

00:29:21.550 --> 00:29:24.560
upper part of the spectrum that
gets generated in the

00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:26.770
second modulation process.

00:29:26.770 --> 00:29:32.380
And the resulting output is the
original signal, x of t.

00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:37.490
What we've done then is
we've taken x of t.

00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:41.120
We've modulated it
onto a carrier.

00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:43.380
And then we've taken that
modulated signal and we've

00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:45.360
figured out how to
get back x of t.

00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:49.545
And of course one could ask,
well, if you start with x of t

00:29:49.545 --> 00:29:52.470
and you want to get x of t back
again, why bother going

00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:53.160
through all that?

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:55.980
Why not just use x of t at the
beginning and at the end?

00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:59.300
And obviously there are
lots of reasons

00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:01.880
as I indicated before.

00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:06.060
And just to reiterate
what they are.

00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:10.540
The notion, often, is that what
you'd like to do is shift

00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:14.330
the signal into a different
frequency band for

00:30:14.330 --> 00:30:19.370
transmission over some medium
that is more matched to that

00:30:19.370 --> 00:30:22.090
frequency band than the
frequency range of the

00:30:22.090 --> 00:30:23.440
original signal.

00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:27.280
Also, as I alluded to, is the
notion that you can take lots

00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:29.460
of signals and transmit them

00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:32.650
simultaneously over one channel--

00:30:32.650 --> 00:30:35.400
whether the channel is a wire,
a microwave link, a satellite

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:36.650
link, or whatever--

00:30:36.650 --> 00:30:40.430
again, using the idea
of modulation.

00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:45.460
And what that process
is referred to as is

00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:46.680
multiplexing.

00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:49.270
And let me just quickly
indicate what that

00:30:49.270 --> 00:30:53.280
multiplexing process
corresponds to.

00:30:53.280 --> 00:31:00.560
We could think, for example,
of taking one signal and

00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:06.760
modulating in it onto one
carrier with one carrier

00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:12.280
frequency, taking a second
signal, modulating it onto a

00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:16.690
different carrier frequency,
taking a third signal and

00:31:16.690 --> 00:31:20.940
modulating it onto a third
carrier frequency, et cetera.

00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:26.520
And if we choose these carrier
frequencies appropriately,

00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:30.380
then we can add all
those together--

00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:33.540
and do it in such a way that
the spectra don't overlap--

00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:38.920
and end up with one broader band
signal that incorporates

00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:45.070
the information simultaneously
in all of those signals.

00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:49.690
So just to illustrate that
in the frequency domain.

00:31:49.690 --> 00:31:56.890
What we have are our three
spectra, Xa, Xb, and Xc.

00:31:56.890 --> 00:32:01.020
And we would, for example,
take this spectrum and

00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:05.780
modulate it to a carrier
frequency, omega sub a.

00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:09.140
We can take this spectrum and
modulate it to a carrier

00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:14.600
frequency, omega sub b, where
omega sub b is chosen so that

00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:18.140
when we add these two together
they don't overlap, so that

00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:20.640
they can eventually
be separated out.

00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:24.380
And then we can do the same
thing with the third signal,

00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:27.990
and put that in a frequency
range over here, being careful

00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:30.330
that none of those overlap.

00:32:30.330 --> 00:32:32.720
And when we add all those
together, the composite

00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:36.890
spectrum is what I show here.

00:32:36.890 --> 00:32:43.430
And as you can see, essentially,
by doing

00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:46.280
appropriate band-pass filtering
we can pull out

00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:50.710
whatever part of the spectrum
we choose to, and then

00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:53.020
demodulate that in the
appropriate way.

00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:55.740
And of course we can do this,
not just with three signals,

00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:59.140
but perhaps with tens or
hundreds of signals.

00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:03.460
So that's a process that is
typically referred to as

00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:04.380
multiplexing.

00:33:04.380 --> 00:33:08.130
And as I've described it here,
it's referred to as

00:33:08.130 --> 00:33:10.460
frequency-division
multiplexing.

00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:14.030
That is, dividing the frequency
band into cells and

00:33:14.030 --> 00:33:19.560
plunking different signals
into each one of those.

00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:23.650
And so if we want now to recover
one of those channels

00:33:23.650 --> 00:33:27.250
in a frequency-division
multiplex system, as I

00:33:27.250 --> 00:33:31.060
indicated, we would
first demultiplex.

00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:35.590
Demultiplexing corresponding to
pulling out the appropriate

00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:40.020
channel with a band-pass
filter.

00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:45.190
And after demultiplexing, we
would then demodulate.

00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:50.510
And we would demodulate with the
carrier appropriate to the

00:33:50.510 --> 00:33:52.340
channel that we've pulled out.

00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:56.800
And the demodulation, of course,
involves multiplying

00:33:56.800 --> 00:34:00.790
by the carrier and doing
appropriate low-pass filtering

00:34:00.790 --> 00:34:03.510
to finally get the
signal back.

00:34:03.510 --> 00:34:13.850
And frequency-division
multiplexing is the type of

00:34:13.850 --> 00:34:18.679
multiplexing that's used, for
example, in typical broadcast

00:34:18.679 --> 00:34:22.090
AM radio systems, where
all the channels are

00:34:22.090 --> 00:34:23.780
superimposed together.

00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:26.520
And it's your home radio
receiver that does the

00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:29.760
appropriate demultiplexing
and demodulating.

00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:32.800
And of course, you can see that
not only is modulation an

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:36.830
important part of that, but as
I alluded to in the last

00:34:36.830 --> 00:34:40.750
lecture, filtering also becomes
important part of

00:34:40.750 --> 00:34:42.000
these practical systems.

00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:51.070
Now, the kind of amplitude
modulation that I've talked

00:34:51.070 --> 00:34:57.310
about so far is what's referred
to as synchronous

00:34:57.310 --> 00:34:58.880
modulation.

00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:04.060
And the reason for the term
synchronous is that what's

00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:10.520
implied in these systems is a
synchronization between the

00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:12.550
transmitter and receiver.

00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:19.200
In particular, in the system as
we've talked about it, the

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:29.010
modulator and the demodulator
have a synchronization in both

00:35:29.010 --> 00:35:30.790
frequency and phase.

00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:33.630
The phase here is indicated
as theta sub c.

00:35:33.630 --> 00:35:39.860
And if we take a look at the
demodulator, the demodulator

00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:44.980
has phase of theta sub c.

00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:50.620
And in general, there's the
issue of whether we can

00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:53.480
maintain that synchronization
between the modulator and

00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:54.830
demodulator.

00:35:54.830 --> 00:36:00.160
And so what we want to examine
now, more generally, is what

00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:03.750
the consequence might be, and
the solution to the resulting

00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:09.300
problems, if we don't have
synchronization between the

00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:11.380
modulator and demodulator.

00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:14.070
Synchronization in
terms of phase.

00:36:14.070 --> 00:36:18.260
And there also is another
problem, which is the issue of

00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:21.230
synchronization in frequency.

00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:23.840
That's examined more
in the text.

00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:26.330
And what I'll focus on here
is just the issue of

00:36:26.330 --> 00:36:28.900
synchronization in phase, to
give you some sense of what

00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:31.920
the issue is.

00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:35.240
So now what we want to look at
is what happens if we have a

00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:43.580
modulator with phase, theta sub
c, and a demodulator where

00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:47.440
the phase, instead of being
theta sub c, is some other

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:51.280
phase, phi sub c.

00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:56.260
And if you track through the
details and the algebra, then

00:36:56.260 --> 00:37:02.040
what you'll find is that the
output of the low-pass filter,

00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:07.650
rather than being x of t, the
signal that we want, is x of t

00:37:07.650 --> 00:37:10.660
multiplied by a scale factor.

00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:13.340
And the scale factor is the
cosine of the phase

00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:14.790
difference.

00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:18.910
Now one could ask, OK well,
what's the big deal about

00:37:18.910 --> 00:37:19.790
scale factor?

00:37:19.790 --> 00:37:21.930
If it's too small we'll make it
big, it it's too big we'll

00:37:21.930 --> 00:37:23.680
make it small.

00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:25.000
But there are several points.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:28.600
One is, notice, for example,
that if the phase difference

00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:32.750
between the modulator and
demodulator is 90 degrees,

00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:36.920
then the output of the
demodulator is zero.

00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:39.970
Or if it isn't quite
90 degrees, the

00:37:39.970 --> 00:37:41.580
amplitude might be small.

00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:44.300
And the implication would be
that if there's other noise it

00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:46.980
gets injected in the system,
the signal-to-noise

00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:49.120
ratio is very low.

00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:55.430
Now even worse is the issue
that if there's a phase

00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:58.220
difference, but the exact
phase difference isn't

00:37:58.220 --> 00:38:01.990
maintained, so that the
modulator and demodulator kind

00:38:01.990 --> 00:38:05.990
of fade in and out of phase,
then the output of the

00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:14.240
demodulator is x of t multiplied
by a time-varying

00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:16.740
fading term, which is the
cosine of the phase

00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:17.500
difference.

00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:21.080
Well what that means,
essentially, is that if you

00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:26.470
use this kind of system to do
the demodulation, then what

00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:31.860
you need to be careful about is
maintaining synchronization

00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:35.560
in phase, and also in frequency,
between the

00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:39.470
modulator and the demodulator.

00:38:39.470 --> 00:38:44.200
Now there are alternatives
to this.

00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:48.590
And the alternative is what's
referred to as asynchronous

00:38:48.590 --> 00:38:50.420
demodulation.

00:38:50.420 --> 00:38:54.530
And let me indicate what the
idea behind asynchronous

00:38:54.530 --> 00:38:57.760
demodulation is.

00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:01.190
Now, recall that what we've done
in amplitude modulation

00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:06.040
is to take the carrier signal
and vary its amplitude with

00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:09.070
the signal that eventually
we want to get back.

00:39:09.070 --> 00:39:12.530
So if we look at the
amplitude-modulated waveform,

00:39:12.530 --> 00:39:16.880
it might typically look
as I indicate here.

00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:22.910
And we're trying to get
back the envelope.

00:39:22.910 --> 00:39:26.060
Well, one could imagine
building a circuit, or

00:39:26.060 --> 00:39:28.450
designing a device, which
in some sense

00:39:28.450 --> 00:39:30.490
will track the envelope.

00:39:30.490 --> 00:39:36.550
And a common circuit to do
that is a fairly simple

00:39:36.550 --> 00:39:41.750
circuit consisting of a diode
and a resistor and capacitor

00:39:41.750 --> 00:39:43.230
in parallel.

00:39:43.230 --> 00:39:48.580
The idea being that the
capacitor charges up as this

00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:50.920
waveform moves up to its peak.

00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:55.690
And then as the waveform drops
down, the capacitor discharges

00:39:55.690 --> 00:39:56.760
through the resistor.

00:39:56.760 --> 00:39:59.520
And it kind of tracks
the envelope.

00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:03.740
In fact, the kind of output that
we would get is the type

00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:07.150
of behavior that I've
indicated here.

00:40:07.150 --> 00:40:13.090
And then that is a type
of demodulation.

00:40:13.090 --> 00:40:15.570
It's a demodulation that
doesn't require

00:40:15.570 --> 00:40:19.470
synchronization between the
modulator and demodulator.

00:40:19.470 --> 00:40:25.400
And it's fairly inexpensive
to build.

00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:30.660
But it has, obviously, some
tradeoffs associated with it.

00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:34.580
Well, to indicate where the
tradeoff comes from, or where

00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:39.210
the issue surfaces, notice
that what we're doing is

00:40:39.210 --> 00:40:43.420
tracking the envelope of
the sinusoidal signal.

00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:46.110
And we're calling that, or we're
assuming that that is

00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:50.010
our original signal, x of t.

00:40:50.010 --> 00:40:56.300
Well, suppose that x of t, the
original signal, is sometimes

00:40:56.300 --> 00:40:59.090
positive and sometimes
negative.

00:40:59.090 --> 00:41:03.490
What might we see as we look
at the output of the

00:41:03.490 --> 00:41:04.590
demodulator?

00:41:04.590 --> 00:41:07.950
Well, the output of the
demodulator would follow the

00:41:07.950 --> 00:41:11.570
envelope down, and then
it would follow the

00:41:11.570 --> 00:41:13.940
envelope back up again.

00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:17.090
In other words, what it would
tend to generate is a

00:41:17.090 --> 00:41:20.680
full-wave rectified version of
the signal that you were

00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:22.610
really trying to get back.

00:41:22.610 --> 00:41:24.970
Now, there's a simple
solution to this.

00:41:24.970 --> 00:41:30.290
The simple solution is to make
sure that the signal that is

00:41:30.290 --> 00:41:33.510
the modulating signal, x of
t, never goes negative.

00:41:33.510 --> 00:41:38.460
So if it happens to-- a voice
signal tends to go negative.

00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:42.570
If it happens to, we can simply
add a constant to it,

00:41:42.570 --> 00:41:44.540
add a large enough constant,
so that it

00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:46.670
always stays positive.

00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:49.840
Well let's look at that.

00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:52.845
What we want to do then, if
we're considering asynchronous

00:41:52.845 --> 00:42:03.090
demodulation, is to take our
original signal, x of t, and

00:42:03.090 --> 00:42:07.960
add to it a constant, where
the constant is made large

00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:13.300
enough so that we're sure that
this is a positive signal.

00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:15.410
And incidentally, let me just
draw your attention to the

00:42:15.410 --> 00:42:19.870
fact that I'm now suppressing
the phase on the carrier

00:42:19.870 --> 00:42:24.280
signal, since the phase is not
important to the argument and

00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:28.550
it's just some additional
notation to carry around.

00:42:28.550 --> 00:42:32.040
So the idea then, is add
a constant to x of t.

00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:36.530
Notice that if we just take this
term and expand it out

00:42:36.530 --> 00:42:41.940
into two terms, x of t cosine
omega c t plus a times cosine

00:42:41.940 --> 00:42:47.690
omega c t, then in block diagram
terms we can represent

00:42:47.690 --> 00:42:50.430
that as I've shown here.

00:42:50.430 --> 00:42:56.090
And so it would correspond to
modulating the signal, x of t,

00:42:56.090 --> 00:43:01.430
onto the carrier, omega sub c
t, and also injecting some

00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:05.500
carrier with an amplitude,
A. And the output of the

00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:08.920
modulator is then the
sum of those two.

00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:14.610
And depending on exactly what
this value A is will influence

00:43:14.610 --> 00:43:16.610
what the envelope
will look like.

00:43:16.610 --> 00:43:21.140
And I indicate below,
two possibilities.

00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:26.110
One is where I've made A fairly
large, and one is where

00:43:26.110 --> 00:43:29.350
I've made A significantly
smaller.

00:43:29.350 --> 00:43:34.010
And there are both positive and
negative issues associated

00:43:34.010 --> 00:43:36.860
with whether A is too large
or A is too small.

00:43:36.860 --> 00:43:49.300
For example, if A is large in
relation to the amplitude of

00:43:49.300 --> 00:43:53.360
the signal, then this envelope
tends to be very flat.

00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:56.510
And it tends to be easy to
track it with that simple

00:43:56.510 --> 00:44:03.450
diode RC circuit, as compared
with the case down here.

00:44:03.450 --> 00:44:09.060
On the other hand, there is a
price that you pay for this

00:44:09.060 --> 00:44:10.660
kind of envelope.

00:44:10.660 --> 00:44:13.350
And the price that you pay is
perhaps best seen in the

00:44:13.350 --> 00:44:15.720
frequency domain.

00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:19.650
If we look in the frequency
domain, here is

00:44:19.650 --> 00:44:22.620
our original spectrum.

00:44:22.620 --> 00:44:27.450
Here is the spectrum at the
output of the modulator.

00:44:27.450 --> 00:44:31.030
And the impulse that occurs
here corresponds to the

00:44:31.030 --> 00:44:33.370
carrier that's injected.

00:44:33.370 --> 00:44:37.510
The larger A is, the more
carrier is injected.

00:44:37.510 --> 00:44:41.900
The more carrier that's
injected, the easier it is for

00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:45.960
the envelope detector
to demodulate.

00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:49.360
So one can ask, why not
just put a lot in?

00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:54.670
Well, the obvious answer
is that it's not an

00:44:54.670 --> 00:44:58.130
information-carrying
part of the signal.

00:44:58.130 --> 00:45:01.670
And so in some sense it
represents an inefficiency in

00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:04.890
transmission, because what
you're transmitting is power,

00:45:04.890 --> 00:45:08.820
energy, that doesn't have
any information

00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:09.900
associated with it.

00:45:09.900 --> 00:45:13.120
It's simply the injection
of a carrier to make the

00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:18.770
demodulation for an asynchronous
demodulator--

00:45:18.770 --> 00:45:23.630
to make the demodulation
easier.

00:45:23.630 --> 00:45:25.340
And so there's this tradeoff.

00:45:25.340 --> 00:45:29.590
And in fact, one represents
the tradeoff and the

00:45:29.590 --> 00:45:32.230
associated parameters very
often in terms of percent

00:45:32.230 --> 00:45:40.240
modulation, where the percent
modulation is essentially the

00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:45.280
ratio of the maximum signal
level to the amplitude of the

00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:47.380
injected carrier.

00:45:47.380 --> 00:45:52.750
And depending on whether the
modulation's very high or very

00:45:52.750 --> 00:45:57.670
low, the tradeoff is that
the transmission is more

00:45:57.670 --> 00:45:59.800
inefficient and it takes
more energy, but the

00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:01.190
demodulator is simpler.

00:46:01.190 --> 00:46:04.910
Or the demodulator is more
complicated but the

00:46:04.910 --> 00:46:06.840
transmission is simpler.

00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:09.780
Now, there are situations where
you might very well want

00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:10.720
to use one or the other.

00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:16.670
For example, in home radio
you're often willing to

00:46:16.670 --> 00:46:21.610
transmit a lot of power so that
you can have inexpensive

00:46:21.610 --> 00:46:24.100
consumer-oriented receivers.

00:46:24.100 --> 00:46:26.790
On the other hand, in satellite
communication you're

00:46:26.790 --> 00:46:31.070
willing to pay a very high price
for the modulators and

00:46:31.070 --> 00:46:34.620
demodulators, but it's the
amount of power that's

00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:37.010
transmitted that's
at a premium.

00:46:37.010 --> 00:46:41.120
And so in one case, satellite
communication, you would use

00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:43.890
synchronous modulation
and demodulation.

00:46:43.890 --> 00:46:46.090
Whereas in typical
consumer-oriented

00:46:46.090 --> 00:46:54.000
broadcasting, you would use
an asynchronous system and

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.980
transmit more power, even if
it's inefficient, so that the

00:46:56.980 --> 00:47:00.470
demodulator can be simpler.

00:47:00.470 --> 00:47:06.400
Now, in the asynchronous system,
as we've indicated,

00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:09.970
there's one source of
inefficiency, which is this

00:47:09.970 --> 00:47:11.900
injection of the carrier.

00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:16.930
There also is a somewhat
different issue, related to

00:47:16.930 --> 00:47:21.120
inefficiency in sinusoidal
amplitude modulation.

00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:26.710
And it's an inefficiency that is
separate from the issue of

00:47:26.710 --> 00:47:28.850
synchronous versus asynchronous
systems.

00:47:28.850 --> 00:47:31.760
In other words, it's not
associated with the injection

00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:35.410
of the carrier, it's a
very different issue.

00:47:35.410 --> 00:47:38.140
Let me indicate what that is.

00:47:38.140 --> 00:47:44.050
Let's look again at the spectrum
of x of t, which I've

00:47:44.050 --> 00:47:45.960
indicated here.

00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:54.600
And in a sinusoidal amplitude
modulation system, we would

00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:58.650
center it around plus and minus
the carrier frequency.

00:47:58.650 --> 00:48:02.500
Now, notice that in the original
system we occupy a

00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:07.490
frequency spectrum that's 2
times omega sub M. By the time

00:48:07.490 --> 00:48:11.450
we've shifted it, thinking
of positive and negative

00:48:11.450 --> 00:48:15.660
frequencies, we've used
up twice as much of

00:48:15.660 --> 00:48:17.950
the frequency spectrum.

00:48:17.950 --> 00:48:22.300
Well you could say, OK, let's
just shift this up this way

00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:24.470
and get rid of this part.

00:48:24.470 --> 00:48:25.860
That's of course what
the complex

00:48:25.860 --> 00:48:27.860
exponential carrier did.

00:48:27.860 --> 00:48:31.360
And the issue there is that
now you've got to transmit

00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:35.110
both a real part and
an imaginary part.

00:48:35.110 --> 00:48:39.190
So what you can think about, and
ask, is if you still want

00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:43.760
to transmit a real-valued
signal, how can you somehow

00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:47.540
remove the inefficiency or
redundancy in the spectrum?

00:48:47.540 --> 00:48:52.750
Well, notice that what we have
is this spectrum moved here,

00:48:52.750 --> 00:48:55.090
and moved here.

00:48:55.090 --> 00:49:02.180
And we could imagine building
real-valued signal by

00:49:02.180 --> 00:49:06.770
eliminating what I refer to here
as the lower sideband out

00:49:06.770 --> 00:49:11.210
of the positive frequencies, and
the lower sideband out of

00:49:11.210 --> 00:49:13.710
the negative frequencies.

00:49:13.710 --> 00:49:18.650
And in effect, what we've done
is taken just the positive

00:49:18.650 --> 00:49:22.510
frequencies here, shifted
them there, the negative

00:49:22.510 --> 00:49:24.460
frequencies here, and
shifted them here.

00:49:24.460 --> 00:49:29.000
And the resulting spectrum
is what I indicate below.

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:32.840
Well, this is what
is often done.

00:49:32.840 --> 00:49:37.020
And what it's referred to
as is single sideband.

00:49:37.020 --> 00:49:40.790
What we've done is kept the
upper sideband, in this

00:49:40.790 --> 00:49:42.050
particular case.

00:49:42.050 --> 00:49:46.390
We could alternatively think
of putting this system

00:49:46.390 --> 00:49:52.760
together where we retain the
lower sideband instead of the

00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:54.250
upper sideband.

00:49:54.250 --> 00:49:59.870
And in either case, what we've
removed is an inefficiency in

00:49:59.870 --> 00:50:01.760
transmission of the signal.

00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:05.380
Namely we have a real-valued
signal, but it only requires

00:50:05.380 --> 00:50:10.710
as much total bandwidth, in
terms of the frequencies in

00:50:10.710 --> 00:50:14.480
which there's energy present,
as the original signal.

00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:16.190
Well how do we do this?

00:50:16.190 --> 00:50:18.160
There are a variety of ways.

00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:22.810
And there's one procedure that
is discussed in more detail in

00:50:22.810 --> 00:50:26.160
the text, which uses what's
referred to as a 90 degree

00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:27.690
phase splitter.

00:50:27.690 --> 00:50:30.720
The simplest way, at least
conceptually, is to think

00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:33.420
about doing it with filtering.

00:50:33.420 --> 00:50:39.810
And the idea simply is that if
we have our modulated signal--

00:50:39.810 --> 00:50:41.810
here's the spectrum of
the modulated signal.

00:50:41.810 --> 00:50:44.780
And if that modulated signal
is simply put through a

00:50:44.780 --> 00:50:51.740
high-pass filter, then the
result will be to eliminate

00:50:51.740 --> 00:50:56.240
the lower sideband, if we choose
the high-pass filter to

00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:59.530
have a characteristic
as I indicate here.

00:50:59.530 --> 00:51:03.820
So this, conceptually, is a
very sharp cutoff filter.

00:51:03.820 --> 00:51:06.810
And what it eliminates are
the lower sidebands.

00:51:06.810 --> 00:51:11.770
And the resulting spectrum
is what we have below.

00:51:11.770 --> 00:51:17.870
And this in fact is really
the basic idea behind

00:51:17.870 --> 00:51:20.130
single-sideband transmission.

00:51:20.130 --> 00:51:22.180
Again, there's a tradeoff.

00:51:22.180 --> 00:51:26.280
It's clearly more efficient
than double-sideband

00:51:26.280 --> 00:51:32.770
transmission, but also has the
complication, or additional

00:51:32.770 --> 00:51:35.760
issue, that the modulator
becomes a little more

00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:39.240
complicated because you need
this filtering operation, or

00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:41.770
some equivalent operation,
to get rid of

00:51:41.770 --> 00:51:43.020
the unwanted sideband.

00:51:46.730 --> 00:51:52.050
Well, this is a fairly quick
tour through a variety of

00:51:52.050 --> 00:51:53.990
issues related to modulation.

00:51:53.990 --> 00:51:58.180
And it really is just the tip
of the iceberg, obviously.

00:51:58.180 --> 00:52:02.180
Modulation in the context of
sinusoidal modulation, as

00:52:02.180 --> 00:52:06.710
we've talked about, has a
lot of detailed issues

00:52:06.710 --> 00:52:09.030
associated with it.

00:52:09.030 --> 00:52:14.220
It's important to recognize, and
to be somewhat pleased by

00:52:14.220 --> 00:52:19.030
the fact, that not only with the
mathematical foundations

00:52:19.030 --> 00:52:24.130
that we've developed can we
understand the basics of

00:52:24.130 --> 00:52:25.610
sinusoidal amplitude
modulation.

00:52:25.610 --> 00:52:32.190
But what you'll find if you dig
into this somewhat deeper

00:52:32.190 --> 00:52:35.940
that the basic background that
we built up so far--

00:52:35.940 --> 00:52:38.190
the mathematical tools--

00:52:38.190 --> 00:52:42.080
are really pretty much what
you need for a much deeper

00:52:42.080 --> 00:52:44.505
understanding of all of
the issues involved.

00:52:47.180 --> 00:52:51.800
So from what might have seemed
like a fairly abstract

00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:54.920
mathematical property associated
with the Fourier

00:52:54.920 --> 00:53:00.460
transform, we've begun to
develop what should give you

00:53:00.460 --> 00:53:05.000
the sense of some important
practical considerations.

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:09.770
And as we'll see the next
lecture, very much the same

00:53:09.770 --> 00:53:15.350
kinds of notions apply for
discrete time, sinusoidal, and

00:53:15.350 --> 00:53:19.000
complex exponential amplitude
modulation.

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:23.060
And also as I indicated at the
beginning of the lecture, in

00:53:23.060 --> 00:53:27.120
the next lecture we'll also talk
about what's referred to

00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:28.770
as pulse amplitude modulation.

00:53:28.770 --> 00:53:30.770
It's a different kind
of carrier.

00:53:30.770 --> 00:53:36.260
And what that will lead to,
among other things, is a very

00:53:36.260 --> 00:53:43.540
important bridge between the
notions of continuous time and

00:53:43.540 --> 00:53:45.080
the notions of discrete time.

00:53:45.080 --> 00:53:46.330
Thank you.
