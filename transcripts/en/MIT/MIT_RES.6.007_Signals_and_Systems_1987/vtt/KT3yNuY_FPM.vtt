00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.990
PROFESSOR: Well, today, we have
a chance to put away the

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.970
equations and have some fun.

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.370
With me is Professor Sandy Hill
from the University of

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:13.970
Massachusetts at Amherst.

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.870
And Sandy, maybe you could just
give us a quick tour of

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:18.860
what we have here.

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:19.590
SANDY HILL: OK.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.070
We'll be dealing with about
four instruments today.

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.800
Two of them generate signals,
and two of them display and

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.400
analyze signals.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.180
The first, and perhaps simplest,
is simply an RC

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.440
audio generator, that will put
out a variety wave shapes.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.510
And we'll look at that
in a moment.

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.340
Over to the right is a device
that will allow us to study

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.590
amplitude modulation and the
various flavors of it.

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.950
Down below is a standard
oscilloscope to look at the

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.850
signals in the time domain so
we can see their shape.

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.790
And then, finally the spectrum
analyzer will analyze the

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.750
signal into its Fourier
components.

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.250
And we'll display those, so you
get to see the spectral

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.650
content of a signal.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.490
PROFESSOR: Now, we'll be seeing
all of these in a fair

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.760
amount of detail as we go
through the demonstrations.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.770
But maybe we can begin just
with the signal generator.

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.030
SANDY HILL: OK, let's
look quickly at the

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.390
various buttons involved.

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.730
There's a lot of flexibility
with this device.

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.590
The top three buttons here allow
us to change from one

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.530
simple wave form to another one,
a sine wave, a triangle

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.330
wave, a square wave.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.490
And right below it is a button
that will allow us to change

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.390
the size of the signal.

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.290
Moving over towards the left,
we can change the DC offset

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.790
which varies the signal,
the level upon

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.550
which the signal rides.

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.390
PROFESSOR: And we'll be using
that actually when we

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.090
demonstrate amplitude
modulation.

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.540
SANDY HILL: That's right And
then finally, there's a way of

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.350
changing the frequency of the
signal, either changing it by

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.770
a factor of 10 or a vernier
adjustment, if you want very

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.850
specific adjustments, very
delicate changes.

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:54.190
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.090
So maybe we can just vary some
of this and see what a little

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.040
bit of it looks like.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.870
SANDY HILL: All right.

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.130
What we have displayed at this
point is the effect of pushing

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.300
the sine wave button.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.060
And so displayed down here
is a 500 Hertz sine wave.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.240
In fact, let's listen to that.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.490
PROFESSOR: Great.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.790
SANDY HILL: And the scope is
said to have one millisecond

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.260
for each division here.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.900
By varying the amplitude
knob can make the sine

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.410
wave smaller or larger.

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.010
The ear isn't too sensitive
to that.

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.400
By changing the DC offset,
it simply rides

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.515
on a different level.

00:03:29.515 --> 00:03:32.260
It's like putting a
battery in series.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.360
And changing the frequency,
you get a very perceptible

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.230
change, a lower frequency.

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.570
It takes longer to sweep
through a period.

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:44.256
Higher frequency, it takes
a shorter amount of time.

00:03:44.256 --> 00:03:48.060
And also, we can change the wave
shape itself from a sine

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.890
wave to a triangle wave--

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.840
and you notice that has
a richer sound to it--

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.210
and then finally to a square
wave, which is an even

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:00.510
brighter sound.

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.640
PROFESSOR: And actually, as you
realize from the previous

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.980
lectures, with the triangle and
square wave with the same

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.740
fundamental as the sine wave,
the richness comes in because

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:17.880
of the higher harmonics in the
Fourier series representation.

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.790
OK, well let's go back
to the sine wave.

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.770
And we'll use that to take
a closer look at

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.190
the spectrum analyzer.

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.720
SANDY HILL: OK.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.140
PROFESSOR: We'll look at a block
diagram of the spectrum

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:32.190
analyzer shortly, but first
let's just look at a few quick

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.360
things to get a feel for it.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.970
We have, of course,
the time domain

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.890
display of the sine wave.

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:44.230
And the spectrum analyzer gives
us a frequency domain

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:46.450
analysis and display.

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:52.540
And the vertical axis
is the amplitude.

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.070
The horizontal axis
is frequency.

00:04:55.070 --> 00:05:00.150
And as it's set currently, the
frequency axis goes from DC--

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:01.150
zero--

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:02.480
up to 2 kilohertz.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.620
And that, of course,
can be varied on

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.950
the spectrum analyzer.

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:10.120
And since we have a sine wave
input, we get, as we would

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.820
expect, a line spectrum,
corresponding to the frequency

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:15.160
of the sine wave.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.970
Now, in fact, we can measure
that frequency because the

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:23.840
spectrum analyzer has a cursor
associated with it, which I've

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.600
just enabled.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.900
And this line is the
cursor line.

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.480
There is a read out for the
frequency and a read out for

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.500
the amplitude.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.390
And let's position
the cursor on the

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:40.320
frequency of the sine wave.

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:44.520
And we're getting close.

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:49.530
And there we are at the
frequency of the sine wave.

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:53.350
And we can read out, in fact,
that it's 500 cycles.

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:55.260
And this is the amplitude.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.910
And, of course, you could verify
the frequency also in

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:01.900
the time domain display,
simply by measuring the

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:05.690
frequency or the period.

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:08.310
SANDY HILL: This is set at
still one millisecond per

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:08.940
centimeter.

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:10.330
So that is 500 Hertz.

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:11.640
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:16.330
Well now maybe what we can
do is vary the frequency.

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.950
Let's vary the frequency of
the sine wave generator.

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:20.030
Maybe also listen to it?

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:21.110
SANDY HILL: I'll turn
on the tone.

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:23.130
Yep.

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:25.550
OK, I'll make the frequency
higher.

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:26.330
And you'll see a

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.810
correspondence in the time domain.

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:33.040
The frequency clearly goes up,
and that line of the spectrum

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.560
also migrates up away
from the cursor.

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:37.690
PROFESSOR: OK, and let me just
point out again that this is

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:38.610
the cursor line.

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:40.680
This isn't the spectra line.

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:46.560
And this is the frequency
content of the sine wave.

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.230
SANDY HILL: We can also change
the amplitude of that line by

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:53.240
making the sine wave
itself smaller.

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.880
And you notice the intensity
of it goes--

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:57.420
PROFESSOR: While you do that,
let me just position the

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:01.790
cursor if I can on
the sine wave.

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:04.880
And now as you vary the
amplitude, we should, in fact,

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:08.685
see this vary.

00:07:08.685 --> 00:07:10.641
SANDY HILL: Well,
that's right.

00:07:10.641 --> 00:07:11.130
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:15.460
Now as Sandy varied the
frequency, he did it slowly

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:19.590
and we saw the line move
as a single line.

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:21.500
Maybe now, Sandy, you
could vary the

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:22.970
frequency more rapidly.

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:29.583
And what will happen is that, in
fact, what we'll get if I--

00:07:29.583 --> 00:07:31.865
SANDY HILL: There'll be
a spreading as we go--

00:07:31.865 --> 00:07:33.430
PROFESSOR: Let me turn
the cursor off.

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:37.870
And what we'll see is a
spreading of the line, so that

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:39.840
the frequency content
is richer.

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.770
And, in fact, the analysis of
this is considerably more

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:43.560
complicated.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:48.050
It corresponds to frequency
modulation, where Sandy is now

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:49.175
the modulating signal.

00:07:49.175 --> 00:07:49.910
SANDY HILL: That's right.

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:53.890
PROFESSOR: And we won't really
be going into issues of

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:57.870
frequency modulation in any
more detail in this

00:07:57.870 --> 00:07:58.710
demonstration.

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:00.670
SANDY HILL: Right.

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:03.240
PROFESSOR: OK, well now let's
go to the overhead projector

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:05.460
and take a look at a
block diagram of

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:06.710
the spectrum analyzer.

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:14.040
The specific spectrum analyzer
that we're using in the

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:18.420
demonstration is made by
Rockland Systems, referred to

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:22.320
as the Rockland Systems
Model FFT 512.

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:29.980
And basically, the idea is to
sample the incoming wave form,

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:33.919
convert that into digital form,
and then the spectrum,

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:38.929
in fact, is computed digitally
using a microprocessor.

00:08:38.929 --> 00:08:45.330
So the overall system block
diagram first consists of a

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:48.280
system which is a
low pass filter.

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:54.100
And this low pass filter is
used in advance of the

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:59.580
sampling process to basically
reduce the artifacts that are

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:01.470
introduced due to sampling.

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:05.490
And although we haven't talked
yet about sampling and the

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:09.200
associated artifacts, basically,
as we'll see in the

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:14.480
upcoming lectures, in order to
sample a wave form and convert

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:17.870
it into digital form, it
requires that the wave form

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:19.990
first be low pass filtered.

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:24.440
So this low pass filter is
referred to-- and will be in

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:25.280
later lectures--

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:27.800
as an anti-aliasing filter.

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:32.840
And this low pass filtered wave
form is then converted to

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:34.750
a sequence.

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:39.730
And so a sequence is generated
for which the sequence values

00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:46.590
are simply samples of the
low pass filtered input.

00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:50.620
This low pass filtered
input is then put

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:52.340
into digital memory.

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:56.730
Basically, a time block of it
is put into digital memory,

00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:59.620
and so that's what we
have down here.

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:02.340
Here is the sequence.

00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:06.520
The sequence is put into
digital memory.

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:11.470
And then an arithmetic processor
computes for the

00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:13.770
samples in this memory.

00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:18.430
It computes the Fourier
transform or the spectrum.

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:22.810
And after the spectrum is
computed and put either into

00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:26.860
the same or a different memory,
that is then put

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:31.560
through a conversion process
back to a continuous time

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:37.210
signal, and finally, put out on
the display that we've been

00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:39.000
seeing in the demonstration.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.190
And so this is just indicative
of the display.

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:46.900
So basically, the idea then
is that the input

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:49.410
wave form comes in.

00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:53.950
It's filtered and sampled and
captured on a block basis, put

00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:58.480
into a digital memory, and then,
a digital computer or

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:02.250
microprocessor computes
the Fourier transform.

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:05.530
And then that Fourier transform
is what we see on

00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:06.930
the display.

00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:10.840
So what we're computing, of
course, are samples of the

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:12.830
Fourier transform.

00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:16.040
And so, for example, if the
input-- let's say--

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:20.680
was a rectangular pulse whose
Fourier transform is of the

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:24.030
form of a sine(x) over x
function, what we would, in

00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:28.700
fact, see on the display are
samples of that at discrete

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:29.900
frequencies.

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:36.140
Or if as we have an input which
is a square wave, what

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:40.560
will generate through the
spectrum analyzer are the

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:45.760
Fourier series coefficients or
equivalently, the harmonics

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:48.720
associated with the
square wave.

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:53.950
OK, well, let's now go back to
the equipment and look at the

00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:55.200
spectrum analyzer.

00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:01.640
We'll look at the square wave
through the spectrum analyzer

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:06.040
shortly, but first what we have
is what we saw before,

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:07.920
which is the sine wave.

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:12.450
And just to point out, again,
the fact that the sine wave

00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:16.550
spectrum, of course, is just a
single line corresponding to

00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:19.080
the fundamental frequency.

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:24.070
And here we have a frequency
scale now that goes from 0 to

00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:25.640
5 kilohertz.

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:29.680
And this is then the 500
cycle sine wave.

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:35.240
And, in fact, we can flip the
cursor on and I happen to just

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:37.110
magically have it positioned
correctly.

00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:41.530
And we see that it's a
500 cycle sine wave.

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:43.030
SANDY HILL: Might be
interesting, Al, to go and

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:45.770
look at a richer set of signals,
such as the triangle

00:12:45.770 --> 00:12:48.730
wave and the square wave--
things that are conveniently

00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:50.650
on the signal generator
itself.

00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:54.000
I'll switch over to
a square wave now.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.340
And what you see is
all the harmonics

00:12:57.340 --> 00:13:00.064
coming up, being displayed.

00:13:00.064 --> 00:13:02.460
PROFESSOR: OK, it's actually
interesting to point out, I

00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:07.460
think, that the square wave,
as we know, is an

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:08.940
odd harmonic function.

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:14.470
And so, in fact, the even
harmonics are missing in the

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:15.220
square wave.

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:17.030
So this is the fundamental.

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:20.320
This is the third harmonic,
fifth harmonic, et cetera.

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:24.940
And then the amplitude of
the square wave decays

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:27.870
proportional to 1 over f, which
is the kind of analysis

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:30.000
that we've gone through in
looking at Fourier series.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.150
SANDY HILL: Right, and if we
switch to the triangle wave,

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:36.730
instead of their decaying as 1
over f, the harmonics decay as

00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:37.800
1 over f squared.

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:39.980
And you see they drop off
much more quickly.

00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:41.310
PROFESSOR: And again,
of course, it's an

00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:43.020
odd harmonic signal.

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:47.730
And so the even numbered
harmonics are missing.

00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:52.450
And maybe just to kind of
emphasize the point, we can

00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:55.720
show the sine wave again and
the square wave again.

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:59.360
SANDY HILL: We'll go through
from the most bland to the

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:01.510
richer to the richest.

00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:02.750
PROFESSOR: OK, and it's
really kind of

00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:03.750
interesting and dramatic--

00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:04.650
SANDY HILL: It's
fun to do that.

00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:06.130
PROFESSOR: --to see the
harmonics pop in.

00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:07.900
SANDY HILL: While we're at the
square wave, let me fiddle

00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:10.100
with the frequency of the square
wave, and we can see

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:13.970
the duality of the time
and frequency domains.

00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:16.480
That is, as you compress things
in the time domain,

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:19.920
such as this, going to a higher
frequency square wave,

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:22.620
the harmonics wonder further
away from each other.

00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:25.950
SANDY HILL: So this is
the fundamental.

00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:28.810
The second harmonic
is missing.

00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:30.290
This is the third harmonic.

00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:31.730
And of course, the fifth.

00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:34.290
SANDY HILL: And as we take this
to an extreme by going to

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:37.500
very low repetition rate
square waves, all those

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:43.370
harmonics come scurrying in and
cluster together near DC.

00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:45.265
PROFESSOR: Kind of fun with
Fourier transforms.

00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:53.170
Well, speaking of time and
frequency scaling, recall that

00:14:53.170 --> 00:14:57.280
we had demonstrated time and
frequency scaling previously

00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:59.880
with the glockenspiel.

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:03.840
And what we had done there was
to record a particular

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:08.110
glockenspiel note, and
then we played that

00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:10.870
back at half speed.

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:14.880
And what we had done in that
case is expanded things in

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:17.740
time, consequently compress
them in frequency.

00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:24.800
And so, comparing that with a
note an octave lower than we

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:27.340
saw that, in fact, the
time scaling had led

00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:29.010
to a frequency scaling.

00:15:29.010 --> 00:15:33.330
And then we also played the same
note back at twice speed.

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:36.120
And in that case, the
frequencies were all scaled up

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:37.010
by a factor of 2.

00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:40.800
And again, we illustrated that
by comparing with the

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:43.660
glockenspiel note a
full octave up.

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:46.890
Now when we did that, we didn't
actually look at the

00:15:46.890 --> 00:15:49.600
time wave forms or spectra.

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:52.230
And having the equipment that we
have here gives us kind of

00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:54.420
a nice opportunity to do that.

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:59.110
So what I have is the tape that
we had originally made of

00:15:59.110 --> 00:16:01.810
the glockenspiel, the original
note that we recorded.

00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:05.670
And what we'll do is look at the
spectrum of that, and then

00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:10.560
compare that spectrum when we
play the tape at half speed

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:13.540
and also play it
at twice speed.

00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:16.240
So let's play the tape.

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:22.160
And what we have is the
glockenspiel right now

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:26.540
displayed on a frequency scale
from 0 to 5 kilohertz.

00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:31.210
Let's just change that to
zero to 10 kilohertz.

00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:33.620
So here is this spectrum.

00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:36.950
Over here we have the
time wave form.

00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:40.740
And here is then the first
spectral line, and we can see

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:44.710
where that is by setting
up the cursor.

00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:48.290
And magically, once again, I
have the cursor positioned at

00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:49.650
just the right spot.

00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:55.120
The first spectral line
is at 1.775 kilohertz.

00:16:55.120 --> 00:17:00.590
And so this is the spectrum
then of the original

00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:02.881
glockenspiel note.

00:17:02.881 --> 00:17:03.320
All right.

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:07.890
Let's stop the tape
and rewind it.

00:17:07.890 --> 00:17:13.660
And now what we want to do is
play that back at half speed.

00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:16.849
Played at half speed,
the frequencies

00:17:16.849 --> 00:17:18.599
should be scaled down.

00:17:18.599 --> 00:17:22.560
And, in particular then the
first spectra line should be

00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:24.760
at a lower frequency.

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:27.730
So let's play that now.

00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:29.320
SANDY HILL: There are really
very complicated signals,

00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:30.200
aren't they?

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:32.760
PROFESSOR: They really are.

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:37.580
Here we have the first
spectral line.

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:41.690
And we can compare that with the
first spectral line that

00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:46.570
we had before which was
at 1.775 kilohertz.

00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:51.030
And, once again, you see that
the time wave form over here

00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:55.800
has been scaled by
a factor of 2.

00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:59.210
So, once again, we see that
time and frequency scaling

00:17:59.210 --> 00:18:00.820
really works.

00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:05.340
Incidentally as Sandy pointed
out, and rightfully so, the

00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:10.200
glockenspiel really is a pretty
complicated signal, as

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:13.870
a graduate student and I found
out when we were preparing the

00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:16.120
original glockenspiel demo.

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:18.380
SANDY HILL: Speaking of
complicated signals, one of my

00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:20.760
favorites is to look
at speech.

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:23.810
I set this up so that what's
coming into my microphone is

00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:26.780
indeed what you're going to
see on the two screens.

00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:29.660
The telephone company thinks of
speech, basically in terms

00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:32.100
of bandwidth, that it extends
from about 300

00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:33.930
Hertz to 3,300 Hertz.

00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:35.880
But, as we'll see in the
spectrum analyzer, there's a

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:37.720
lot of leakage outside
of that.

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:40.860
The telephone company just
filters out everything outside

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:43.130
of that and things of that
as a speech signal.

00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:46.220
So it doesn't have the high
fidelity that you might have

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:47.630
on high fire equipment.

00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:51.800
As we look at the scope, again,
the time wave form is

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:55.460
extremely complicated, seems to
have some periodicities in

00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:57.670
it, although they're
short-lived, and then it goes

00:18:57.670 --> 00:19:00.120
on to some other
periodic chunk.

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:02.950
And over in the frequency
domain, you can see as we

00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:08.020
extend from 0 to 10 kilohertz,
that as I speak, there are

00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:11.750
trenchants that have spectral
content in them, covering that

00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:12.990
entire band.

00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:14.460
I can try some simpler
signals.

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:17.550
A whistle is almost a sinusoid,
but as you'll see

00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:19.170
isn't terribly sinusoidal.

00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:22.920
[HIGH-PITCHED WHISTLE]

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:24.310
That's the best I can do.

00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:28.176
I can sing, a little bit
embarrassedly, a B,

00:19:28.176 --> 00:19:28.670
[HIGH-PITCHED]

00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:30.220
Boo, and things like that.

00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:32.720
PROFESSOR: They don't
ask me to, Sandy.

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:35.440
SANDY HILL: And then different
vowel sounds have a lot of

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:40.280
energy in, like the letter A.
(SUNG) A. Whereas some of the

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:42.800
others are very impulsive,
like--

00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:43.210
[HISSING]

00:19:43.210 --> 00:19:45.540
Or puh and tuh.

00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:48.160
And it's a little hard to grab
them at the right time.

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:51.390
But what's fascinating is just
to stare at equipment like

00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:54.410
this and try different speech
sounds, and you begin to get

00:19:54.410 --> 00:19:58.300
sort of a sense of the
complicated nature of them.

00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:02.040
PROFESSOR: OK, well that's a
look at some spectra signals.

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:08.780
And now what we'd like to focus
on is the modulator and

00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:12.215
talk a little bit about
modulation and demodulation

00:20:12.215 --> 00:20:13.800
and demonstrate it.

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:18.510
And let's begin that by first
taking a look at a block

00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:20.940
diagram of the modulator
system.

00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:27.260
Well, as we've discussed in a
previous lecture, amplitude

00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:32.790
modulation basically consists of
multiplying the modulating

00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:36.900
signal by an appropriate
carrier, illustrated here, as

00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:41.870
we've seen previously, for the
case of a sinusoidal carrier.

00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:45.930
And then, specifically for
sinusoidal amplitude

00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:51.580
modulation, we may or may not
inject some carrier signal--

00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:53.660
A times the carrier.

00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:59.610
Or equivalently, if we look at
the modulated output, the

00:20:59.610 --> 00:21:03.800
injection of the carrier is
equivalent, mathematically, to

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:07.310
simply adding a DC offset
or a constant to

00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:09.250
the modulating signal.

00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:14.490
And, as you recall when we
talked about this, the idea of

00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:19.310
injecting a carrier or not is
related to the issue of

00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:22.860
whether or not we want to do
synchronous or asynchronous

00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:24.290
demodulation.

00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:27.540
The asynchronous demodulation
corresponding to the simple

00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:30.050
use of an envelope detector.

00:21:30.050 --> 00:21:34.250
And to remind you of the wave
forms that are involved,

00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:38.230
again, I show two that
we saw previously.

00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:44.360
And for the case, this is for
one value of the amount of

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:45.720
carrier that's injected.

00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:50.170
And this is for an amount of
carrier injected that's less.

00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:54.560
And this, in fact, corresponds
to what we refer to as 50%

00:21:54.560 --> 00:22:00.020
modulation, and this is the
case of 100% modulation.

00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:04.810
Well, the modulating system
that we're using in this

00:22:04.810 --> 00:22:08.630
demonstration is basically
of the form that

00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:10.160
we're indicating here.

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:16.020
And a simple block diagram for
it is more or less identical

00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:17.820
to what we just saw.

00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:22.400
Specifically, the modulating
signal is

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:25.010
multiplied by the carrier.

00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:29.300
And there also is the capability
of injecting some

00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:33.420
additional carrier, meaning
adding it to the output of

00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:34.430
this product.

00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:38.900
And so the modulated output can
have a variable percent

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:39.770
modulation--

00:22:39.770 --> 00:22:44.000
the percent modulation being
changed, depending on how we

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.690
set this variable gain.

00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:50.450
Now, in addition to sinusoidal
modulation--

00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:53.980
in fact, for the particular
system that we're using, we

00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:56.350
have somewhat more
flexibility.

00:22:56.350 --> 00:22:59.340
We can use, in addition to a
sinusoidal carrier at this

00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:04.640
point, we can alternatively
choose a square wave carrier

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:07.540
or a triangular carrier.

00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:10.600
And, as we'll indicate in a
moment when we illustrate

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:14.280
this, there are some specific
advantages to using, for

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:17.300
example, a square
wave carrier.

00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:21.890
So this is a somewhat simplified
version of--

00:23:21.890 --> 00:23:26.730
or rather block diagram of the
modulating system that we're

00:23:26.730 --> 00:23:27.950
demonstrating.

00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:32.010
The external modulating input
here, a choice of carrier with

00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:35.100
also the capability for
injecting some additional

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:37.350
carrier into the output.

00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:39.490
OK, now let's go back
to the equipment and

00:23:39.490 --> 00:23:42.100
take a look at this.

00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:45.290
Well, Sandy, maybe to begin,
you can just point out what

00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:47.800
some of the controls are
on the modulator box.

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:50.180
SANDY HILL: OK, there
are some interesting

00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:52.230
points to look at here.

00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:54.860
This is an input for
an external signal.

00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:57.330
We'll be taking a signal right
out of the signal generator

00:23:57.330 --> 00:23:58.670
and putting it in here.

00:23:58.670 --> 00:24:01.960
And that will be the signal
that will be modulated,

00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:03.560
according to the carrier.

00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:06.450
The carrier is generated
internally in this device.

00:24:06.450 --> 00:24:08.870
And there are several ways
of controlling it.

00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:12.170
One is the amount of
carrier injection.

00:24:12.170 --> 00:24:16.410
One is the wave form of the
carrier itself-- and this is

00:24:16.410 --> 00:24:19.530
typically sinusoidal in the
broadcast industry, but others

00:24:19.530 --> 00:24:21.710
are interesting to
look at as well.

00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:24.110
The output that will be
displaying on both the

00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:27.310
spectrum analyzer and scope
comes out here.

00:24:27.310 --> 00:24:30.580
And then farther over to the
left, there are some knobs for

00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:33.440
changing the frequency of
the carrier signal.

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:37.340
PROFESSOR: OK, let me also
just point out again for

00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:40.780
emphasis that changing the
carrier level, as we've talked

00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:43.800
about, is mathematically
equivalent to changing the DC

00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:45.990
level of the modulating
signal.

00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:49.545
And that's also what affects the
percent modulation as we

00:24:49.545 --> 00:24:51.320
had just discussed.

00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:56.930
Now what we have set up is a
sinusoidal modulating signal

00:24:56.930 --> 00:24:59.050
and a sinusoidal
little carrier.

00:24:59.050 --> 00:25:04.120
And, as usual, we have the time
wave form displayed here.

00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:06.840
And so this is the
modulated signal.

00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:10.070
And then on the spectrum
analyzer, we have

00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:11.870
the spectral display.

00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:14.750
And this is the carrier
signal.

00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:16.620
That's the carrier frequency.

00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:21.070
And these side bands then
correspond to the side bands

00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:23.270
associated with the
modulating signal.

00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:27.730
So this is the spectrum of the
total modulated output, right?

00:25:27.730 --> 00:25:28.480
SANDY HILL: Right.

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:30.990
It's interesting to vary some
of these parameters.

00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:33.560
You can see the sinusoidal
modulating

00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:34.970
shape at this point.

00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:39.010
Let me switch that to
a triangular shape.

00:25:39.010 --> 00:25:42.500
And, again, it's a little hard
to sink in both the modulating

00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:45.150
signal and the carrier, so you
see the carrier kind of

00:25:45.150 --> 00:25:47.630
wondering by, but there it is.

00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:49.950
Another thing that can be varied
is the amplitude of the

00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:50.950
modulating signal.

00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:52.280
I'll make it smaller--

00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:54.960
you'll see the side
bands go away--

00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:58.070
until finally we have a pure
sinusoidal carrier--

00:25:58.070 --> 00:26:00.040
as I bring them back in.

00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:01.440
Again, this is triangular.

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:04.160
There would be harmonics there
that maybe they're a little

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:06.560
hard to see in the spectrum
analyzer.

00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:10.570
I'll go back first to a square
wave modulating signal, which

00:26:10.570 --> 00:26:14.630
is, again, you can see the
square wave on top and one on

00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:15.740
the bottom.

00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:18.480
PROFESSOR: And so all of this,
then, represents side bands.

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:19.050
Is that--

00:26:19.050 --> 00:26:19.330
SANDY HILL: That's right.

00:26:19.330 --> 00:26:23.450
Those are the side bands due to
the square wave modulation.

00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:26.130
Going back to the simplest,
the sinusoidal carrier.

00:26:26.130 --> 00:26:30.330
Another thing we can do is to
vary the frequency of the

00:26:30.330 --> 00:26:32.790
sinusoidal signal that's
modulating it.

00:26:32.790 --> 00:26:34.890
I'll make it higher.

00:26:34.890 --> 00:26:37.650
And you'll notice that the side
bands wander away from

00:26:37.650 --> 00:26:40.230
the carrier signal
in the spectrum.

00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:43.130
The spectrum, the carrier signal
of that, doesn't have a

00:26:43.130 --> 00:26:46.040
frequency that's changing
as I do this.

00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:48.900
It's just the width of
the band, due to

00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:49.990
the modulating signal.

00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:51.350
PROFESSOR: So this
is the carrier.

00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:52.740
And these are the side bands.

00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:53.280
SANDY HILL: That's right.

00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:56.570
Now as we go out very far, those
side bands get gobbled

00:26:56.570 --> 00:26:58.215
up by the carrier itself.

00:26:58.215 --> 00:27:01.510
I'll come back to a nice
reasonable point there.

00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:09.060
PROFESSOR: OK, now, we can
change also the carrier

00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:13.790
frequency and, as Sandy's
indicated, various parameters.

00:27:13.790 --> 00:27:17.690
Now let me just point out, since
I didn't previously,

00:27:17.690 --> 00:27:21.380
that the frequency scale that
we're looking at here is a

00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:24.790
frequency scale out
to 20 kilohertz.

00:27:24.790 --> 00:27:28.770
And we had talked about--
or Sandy had indicated--

00:27:28.770 --> 00:27:33.210
that we can change the
carrier signal shape.

00:27:33.210 --> 00:27:38.550
And let me change the carrier
signal from a sine wave to a

00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:39.970
square wave.

00:27:39.970 --> 00:27:43.190
Now you haven't seen any change
on this particular

00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:47.680
display , but let me change
the frequency scale.

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:54.060
And what you see now is the
modulating signal showing up

00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:58.090
around harmonics associated
with the carrier.

00:27:58.090 --> 00:28:03.100
And those harmonics will go
away when we go back to a

00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:04.630
sinusoidal carrier.

00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:06.300
SANDY HILL: This is actually
called a ring modulator.

00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:09.600
It's very simple to multiply
a signal by a square wave.

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:11.220
It's just a chopping process.

00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:13.770
And so a square wave carrier
signal is very

00:28:13.770 --> 00:28:15.380
convenient to generate.

00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:19.676
And then you simply filter out
the higher order harmonics.

00:28:19.676 --> 00:28:21.660
PROFESSOR: Right, I'll
go back to the

00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:23.850
scale that we had before.

00:28:23.850 --> 00:28:28.160
And Sandy had also commented
that we can

00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:31.190
change the carrier level.

00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:33.870
And let's do that on
the modulator box.

00:28:33.870 --> 00:28:38.140
We could do that either by
changing a DC offset on the

00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:40.700
modulating signal or by changing
the amount of carrier

00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:41.950
that's injected.

00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:46.170
And as we decrease the amount
of carrier, in fact, going

00:28:46.170 --> 00:28:49.550
down to no carrier at all
or almost no carrier.

00:28:49.550 --> 00:28:51.280
That's suppressed carrier.

00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:55.340
We have only the two side bands
and the signal is now

00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:58.320
highly over-modulated.

00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:05.390
We bring the carrier back up and
when we do that, then we

00:29:05.390 --> 00:29:11.350
are reducing the percent
modulation and simultaneously

00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:15.420
obviously related to that is
changing the carrier level.

00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:21.230
Now I had indicated in previous
lectures that

00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:24.270
reducing the carrier is
efficient in terms of power

00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:30.250
transmission, but requires a
synchronous demodulator,

00:29:30.250 --> 00:29:34.730
whereas if there's carrier
injected, as we have here, so

00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:36.200
that we're not over-modulating--

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:38.700
the percent modulation
is less than 100--

00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:42.180
then because of the shape of the
time wave form, as you can

00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:47.480
see here, you can do the
demodulation with a more or

00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:50.520
less simple envelope detector.

00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:54.500
And in fact, a envelope detector
of the type that

00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:57.720
we've talked about before is
exactly what is used in AM

00:29:57.720 --> 00:30:01.560
radios, because of the fact
that it's so inexpensive.

00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:05.650
And so here the power
transmitted required is

00:30:05.650 --> 00:30:09.800
higher, but the demodulator,
based on using an envelope

00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:12.280
detector, is considerably
simpler.

00:30:15.150 --> 00:30:18.900
Well, speaking of AM radios,
what we'd like to now

00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:24.030
demonstrate is modulation and
demodulation with an AM radio,

00:30:24.030 --> 00:30:27.710
which Sandy happens
to have here.

00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:31.670
And let's see, I guess, what
you're going to do, Sandy, is

00:30:31.670 --> 00:30:32.815
take it apart for us, right?

00:30:32.815 --> 00:30:33.070
SANDY HILL: Right.

00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:34.930
I've taken off the back.

00:30:34.930 --> 00:30:39.260
And I'm just now going to slip
out the guts of it all, and

00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:42.940
try and set it up so you can see
it conveniently, such as

00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:44.846
right there.

00:30:44.846 --> 00:30:47.140
PROFESSOR: Now, this is your
daughter's radio that you

00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:47.750
promised to give back.?

00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:50.480
SANDY HILL: I would say was
my daughter's radio.

00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:53.250
And now let's start attaching
clip leads, because what we're

00:30:53.250 --> 00:30:56.480
going to want to do is to be
able to see the signals coming

00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:57.580
out of the radio.

00:30:57.580 --> 00:31:00.890
We want to see both the audio
and then the modulated signal

00:31:00.890 --> 00:31:02.800
and try and see them on
the oscilloscope.

00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:05.005
So I'll start setting
that up now.

00:31:05.005 --> 00:31:05.700
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:06.760
Let me--

00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:11.220
while you're doing that-- also
just comment that the kind of

00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:13.790
AM radio that we're looking
at here is called a

00:31:13.790 --> 00:31:15.350
superheterodyne receiver.

00:31:15.350 --> 00:31:19.380
And the way that it does the
demodulation is not exactly

00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:20.950
the way we've talked about
it in the lectures.

00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:22.320
It's very close.

00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:25.770
The idea is this the RF signal,
the radio frequency

00:31:25.770 --> 00:31:29.790
signal, first gets modulated
down to what's called an IF

00:31:29.790 --> 00:31:32.320
stage-- the intermediate
frequency stage.

00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:36.840
And then it's that signal that
goes to an envelope detector

00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:39.280
of the type we've talked
about to generate

00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:41.930
the demodulated signal.

00:31:41.930 --> 00:31:45.900
So, I guess what Sandy has
some probes on are the RF

00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:48.540
input and a ground--

00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:49.260
SANDY HILL: That's right.

00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:50.960
The red lead here is a ground.

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:53.650
It's common for both the signals
we'll be looking at.

00:31:53.650 --> 00:31:54.520
This is at the audio.

00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:56.660
We're actually looking at the
signal going directly into the

00:31:56.660 --> 00:31:58.720
speaker across these
two leads.

00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:01.810
And then this probe down here,
which I found by hunting and

00:32:01.810 --> 00:32:05.740
pecking, is the IF signal, the
intermediate frequency signal,

00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:08.490
with a station on it that I'll
now try and get something that

00:32:08.490 --> 00:32:09.380
sounds reasonable.

00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:12.146
[RADIO FEEDBACK]

00:32:12.146 --> 00:32:12.610
SANDY HILL: OK.

00:32:12.610 --> 00:32:13.710
A little sports.

00:32:13.710 --> 00:32:15.755
PROFESSOR: Never quite know what
you're going to get when

00:32:15.755 --> 00:32:16.910
you turn this on.

00:32:16.910 --> 00:32:18.160
SANDY HILL: That's
right, you don't.

00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:23.960
Make some adjustments there.

00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:27.500
And what you can see right
here is the audio signal.

00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:31.480
I'll give it a little
bit more game.

00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:34.510
And this is the actual
intermediate frequency,

00:32:34.510 --> 00:32:36.380
modulated by the audio.

00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:39.010
And there's a correspondence
between them that goes by

00:32:39.010 --> 00:32:42.180
awfully fast, but I think it's
pretty simple to see.

00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:45.550
PROFESSOR: So basically the top
trace is the envelope of

00:32:45.550 --> 00:32:46.170
the bottom right.

00:32:46.170 --> 00:32:47.000
SANDY HILL: That's right.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.860
This is what comes out of
the envelope detector.

00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:52.800
And this is the signal into the
envelope detector, in this

00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:55.930
particular radio.

00:32:55.930 --> 00:32:59.850
What I'd like to do for a last
experiment is what we've been

00:32:59.850 --> 00:33:00.700
doing at this point--

00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:02.470
I'll turn this off
for a moment--

00:33:02.470 --> 00:33:05.190
is we're taking something that's
coming in over the

00:33:05.190 --> 00:33:08.350
airwaves, as they used to say,
and we're simply viewing it.

00:33:08.350 --> 00:33:10.690
What I'd like to do now is
generate our own radio

00:33:10.690 --> 00:33:13.390
frequency signal, tune it
up so this radio is

00:33:13.390 --> 00:33:15.160
going to hear it--

00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:16.300
whatever that means--

00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:18.710
and display it here.

00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:23.170
What we're going to do then is
use the audio oscillator,

00:33:23.170 --> 00:33:26.710
along with the amplitude
modulator.

00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:30.060
And we're going to take from the
output now the lead here.

00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:32.020
And this will act
as the antenna.

00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:34.900
This device was not designed
to put out a lot of power.

00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:37.550
But fortunately we don't have a
lot of distance to go over.

00:33:37.550 --> 00:33:40.480
What I'm going to do is turn
myself into an antenna--

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:43.250
I'm basically 150 pounds
of salt water--

00:33:43.250 --> 00:33:46.380
and when I touch this, the
signal coming in here, which

00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:49.550
is radiating a little from the
wire, is going to suddenly

00:33:49.550 --> 00:33:52.150
radiate from my whole body and
hopefully will be enough

00:33:52.150 --> 00:33:53.450
to be picked up.

00:33:53.450 --> 00:33:58.130
So what I'll do is I'm going
to turn this on--

00:33:58.130 --> 00:33:59.800
excuse the noise.

00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:02.850
Now I've set this up so it's
tuned to a particular radio

00:34:02.850 --> 00:34:04.900
station, and I hope
I can find it now.

00:34:07.850 --> 00:34:09.100
It takes a little fussing.

00:34:14.179 --> 00:34:15.429
That's not it.

00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:19.710
That sounds like it now.

00:34:19.710 --> 00:34:22.210
OK.

00:34:22.210 --> 00:34:25.929
PROFESSOR: So this gets billed
as Sandy Hill, human antenna.

00:34:25.929 --> 00:34:27.580
SANDY HILL: That's right.

00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:30.920
What you're looking at here is
I've got the antenna at this

00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:33.630
point, and what we're going
to do is you're

00:34:33.630 --> 00:34:35.110
seeing the audio signal.

00:34:35.110 --> 00:34:37.980
This is coming from the signal
generator up here.

00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:42.699
And this is the intermediate
frequency signal again.

00:34:42.699 --> 00:34:45.389
You can hear it's much stronger
when my body becomes

00:34:45.389 --> 00:34:47.250
the antenna.

00:34:47.250 --> 00:34:48.909
And I'll leave it
on for a second.

00:34:48.909 --> 00:34:51.872
And I can switch to
square wave--

00:34:51.872 --> 00:34:54.199
doesn't look much like
a square wave.

00:34:54.199 --> 00:34:56.590
Various things.

00:34:56.590 --> 00:34:59.780
There's significant distortion,
because of all the

00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:02.290
transformations that the signal
is going through.

00:35:02.290 --> 00:35:06.870
But it does indeed work, and
we're picking up a frequency

00:35:06.870 --> 00:35:09.360
that the radio is tuned to.

00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:10.170
And that's it.

00:35:10.170 --> 00:35:13.590
PROFESSOR: So Sandy has
now been modulated and

00:35:13.590 --> 00:35:14.080
demodulated.

00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:16.280
SANDY HILL: That's right.

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:19.090
PROFESSOR: Well, hopefully, all
the things that we've gone

00:35:19.090 --> 00:35:23.800
through in the process of this
tape and this set of

00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:27.250
demonstrations gives you a feel
for at least some of the

00:35:27.250 --> 00:35:30.920
things that we've talked about
so far in the course.

00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:35.430
And Sandy, I'd really like to
thank you for joining us, for

00:35:35.430 --> 00:35:38.260
sharing your insights with us,
as well as sharing your

00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:38.940
equipment with us.

00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:39.300
Thanks a lot.

00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:40.210
SANDY HILL: It was a treat.

00:35:40.210 --> 00:35:41.460
Thank you.
