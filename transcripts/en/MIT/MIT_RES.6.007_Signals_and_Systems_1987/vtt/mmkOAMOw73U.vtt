00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.940
PROFESSOR: In the last lecture,
we discussed discrete

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.760
time processing of continuous
time signals.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.069
And, as you know, the basis for
that arises essentially

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:06.150
out of a sampling theorem.

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.240
Now in that context, and also
in its own right, another

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.850
important sampling issue is the
sampling of discrete time

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.640
signals, in other words, the
sampling of a sequence.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.000
One common context in which this
arises, for example, is,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.690
if we've converted from a
continuous time signal to a

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:32.150
sequence, and we then carry out
some additional filtering,

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.260
then there's the possibility
that we can resample that

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.460
sequence, and as we'll see as we
go through the discussion,

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.300
save something in the way
of storage or whatever.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.800
So discrete time sampling, as
I indicated, has important

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.930
application in a context
referred to here, namely

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.830
resampling after discrete
time filtering.

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.370
And closely related to that,
as we'll indicate in this

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:04.270
lecture, is the concept of using
discrete time sampling

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.740
for what's referred to as
sampling rate conversion.

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:15.220
And also closely associated with
both of those ideas is a

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.120
set of ideas that I'll bring
up in today's lecture,

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.980
referred to as decimation and
interpolation of discrete time

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.420
signals or sequences.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.550
Now the basic process for
discrete time sampling is the

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.720
same as it is for continuous
time sampling.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.880
Namely, we can analyze it and
set it up on the basis of

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.330
multiplying or modulating a
discrete time signal by an

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.430
impulse train, the impulse train
essentially, or pulse

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.140
train, pulling out sequence
values at the times that we

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.950
want to sample.

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:58.400
So the basic block diagram for
the sampling process is to

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.430
modulate or multiply the
sequence that we want to

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.520
sample by an impulse train.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:11.380
And here, the impulse train has
impulses spaced by integer

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.160
multiples of capital N.
This then becomes

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.170
the sampling period.

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.010
And the result of that
modulation is then the sample

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.230
sequence x of p of n.

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.250
So if we just look at what a
sequence and a sampled version

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:33.750
of that sequence might look
like, what we have here is an

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.220
original sequence x of n.

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.790
And then we have the sampling
impulse train, or sampling

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.120
sequence, and it's the
modulation or product of these

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.840
two that gives us the sample
sequence x of p of n.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.090
And so, as you can see,
multiplying this by this

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.640
essentially pulls out of the
original sequence sample

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.740
values at the times that
this pulse train is on.

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.330
And of course here, I've drawn
this for the case where

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:12.570
capital N, the sampling
period, is equal to 3.

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:18.540
Now the analysis of discrete
time sampling is very similar

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.579
to the analysis of continuous
time sampling.

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:24.100
And let's just quickly
look through the

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.990
steps that are involved.

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:28.380
We're modulating or

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.430
multiplying in the time domain.

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.870
And what that corresponds to in
the frequency domain is a

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.330
convolution.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:43.020
And so the spectrum of the
sampled sequence is the

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.710
periodic convolution of the
spectrum of the sampling

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.700
sequence and the
spectrum of the

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.210
sequence that we're sampling.

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:59.680
And since the sampling sequence
is an impulse train,

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.500
as we know, the Fourier
transform of an impulse train

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.560
is itself an impulse train.

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.500
And so this is the Fourier
transform of

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.990
the sampling sequence.

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:17.340
And now, finally, the Fourier
transform of the resulting

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:23.080
sample sequence, being the
convolution of this with the

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.300
Fourier transform of the
sequence that we're sampling,

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:32.090
gives us then a spectrum which
consists of a sum of

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:35.370
replicated versions of the
Fourier transform of the

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.970
sequence that we're sampling.

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:40.940
In other words, what we're
doing, very much as we did in

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:44.790
continuous time, is, through the
sampling process when we

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:49.460
look at it in the frequency
domain, taking the spectrum of

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:53.190
the sequence there were sampling
and shifting it and

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:54.540
then adding it in--

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.470
shifting it by integer
multiples of

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:58.900
the sampling frequency.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.620
In particular, looking back
at this equation, what we

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:09.120
recognize is that this term, k
times 2 pi over capital N, is

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:14.460
in fact an integer multiple
of the sampling frequency.

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:17.260
And the same thing
is true here.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:23.080
This is k times omega sub s,
where omega sub s, the

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:30.580
sampling frequency, is 2 pi
divided by capital N.

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:34.720
All right, so now let's look at
what this means pictorially

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:37.520
or graphically in the
frequency domain.

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:42.110
And as you can imagine, since
the analysis and algebra is

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:45.740
similar to what happens in
continuous time, we would

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:49.410
expect the pictures to more or
less be identical to what

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:51.570
we've seen previously
for continuous time.

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:53.660
And indeed that's the case.

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:58.890
So here we have the spectrum
of the signal

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:00.460
that's we're sampling.

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:04.160
This is its Fourier transform,
with an assumed highest

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:08.700
frequency omega sub m, highest
frequency over a 2pi range, or

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:10.810
over a range of pi, rather.

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:18.520
And now the spectrum of the
sampling signal is what I show

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:22.680
below, which is an impulse train
with impulses occurring

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:27.260
at integer multiples of the
sampling frequency.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:31.930
And then finally, the
convolution of these two is

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:35.760
simply this one replicated
at the

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:37.910
locations of these impulses.

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:41.610
And so that's finally
what I show below.

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:46.770
And here I made one particular
choice for

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:48.460
the sampling period.

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:54.760
This in particular corresponds
to a sampling period which is

00:07:54.760 --> 00:08:00.570
capital N equal to 3.

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:04.520
And so the sampling frequency,
omega sub s, is

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:07.210
2pi divided by 3.

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:16.060
Now when we look at this, what
we recognize is that we have

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:20.060
basically the same issue here as
we had in continuous time,

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:25.730
in the sense that when these
individual replications of the

00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:30.600
Fourier transform, when the
sampling frequency is chosen

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:34.370
high enough so that they don't
overlap, then we see the

00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:37.539
potential for being able to
get one of them back.

00:08:37.539 --> 00:08:40.659
On the other hand, when they
do overlap then what we'll

00:08:40.659 --> 00:08:43.309
have is aliasing, in particular,
discrete time

00:08:43.309 --> 00:08:46.460
aliasing, much as we had
continuous time aliasing in

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:48.030
the continuous time case.

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:53.330
Well notice in this picture
that what we have is we've

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:59.370
chosen this picture so that
omega sub s minus omega sub m

00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:04.360
is greater than omega sub m, or
equivalently, so that omega

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:11.890
sub s is greater than
2 omega sub m.

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:15.240
And so with omega sub s greater
than 2 omega sum m,

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:17.600
that corresponds to
this picture.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:23.330
Whereas, if that condition is
violated then, in fact, the

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:27.160
picture that we would have is
a picture that looks like.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:32.030
And in this picture, the
individual replications of the

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:36.700
Fourier transform of the
original signal overlap.

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:41.770
And we can no longer recover the
Fourier transform of the

00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:43.000
original signal.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.390
And this, just as it was in
continuous time, is referred

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:50.860
to as aliasing.

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:54.870
Now let's look more closely at
the situation in which there

00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:56.120
is no aliasing.

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:07.280
So in that case, what we have is
a Fourier transform for the

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:13.980
sampled signal, which is as
I indicated here, and the

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:17.380
Fourier transform for the
original signal, as I indicate

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:18.710
at the top.

00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:22.190
And the question now is
how do we recover this

00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:23.590
one from this one.

00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:27.340
Well, the way that we do that,
just as we did in a continuous

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:31.010
time case, is by a low
pass filtering.

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:34.520
In particular, processing in
the time domain or in the

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:40.590
frequency domain, this with an
ideal low pass filter has the

00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:46.080
effect of extracting that part
of the spectrum that in fact

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:53.400
we identify with the original
signal that we began with.

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:57.470
So what we see, again, is
that the process is

00:10:57.470 --> 00:10:58.460
very much the same.

00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:01.170
As long as there's no aliasing,
we can recover the

00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:06.150
original signal by ideal
low pass filtering.

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:13.290
So the overall system is, just
to reiterate, a system which

00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:20.400
consists of modulating the
original sequence with a pulse

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:22.960
train or impulse train.

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:27.160
And then that is going
to be processed

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:30.370
with a low pass filter.

00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:34.140
The spectrum of the original
signal x of n

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:36.770
is what I show here.

00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:40.020
The spectrum of the sampled
signal, where I'm drawing the

00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:43.830
picture on the assumption that
the sampling period is 3, is

00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:47.470
now what's indicated, where
these are replicated, where

00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:50.320
the original spectrum
is replicated.

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:56.740
This is now processed through
a filter which, for exact

00:11:56.740 --> 00:12:01.220
reconstruction, is an ideal
low pass filter.

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:04.820
And so we would multiply this
spectrum by this one.

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:08.980
And the result, after doing
that, will generate a

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:11.890
reconstructed spectrum
which, in fact, is

00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:14.300
identical to the original.

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:21.450
So the frequency domain
picture is the same.

00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:24.740
And what we would expect then
is that the time domain

00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:26.110
picture would be the same.

00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:29.380
Well, let's in fact look
at the time domain.

00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:34.780
And in the time domain, what we
have is an analysis more or

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:38.340
less identical to what we
had in continuous time.

00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:41.360
We of course have
the same system.

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:45.260
And in the time domain,
we are multiplying

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.550
by an impulse train.

00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:54.340
Consequently, the sample
sequence is an impulse train

00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:58.820
whose values are samples of x
of at integer multiples of

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:05.310
capital N. For the
reconstruction, this is now

00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:10.220
processed through an ideal
low pass filter.

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:11.610
And that implements a

00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:13.900
convolution in the time domain.

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:17.700
And so the reconstructed signal
is the convolution of

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:22.720
the sample sequence and the
filter impulse response.

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:26.010
And expressed another way,
namely writing out the

00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:29.250
convolution as a sum, we
have this expression.

00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:34.010
And so it says then that the
reconstruction is carried out

00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:41.430
by replacing the impulses
here, these impulses, by

00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:44.460
versions of the filter
impulse response.

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:53.360
Well, if the filter is an ideal
low pass filter, then

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:58.020
that corresponds in the time
domain to sine nx over sine x

00:13:58.020 --> 00:13:58.840
kind of function.

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:03.570
And that is the interpolation
in between the samples to do

00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:05.800
the reconstruction.

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:10.870
Also, as is discussed somewhat
in the text, we can consider

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:14.680
other kinds of interpolation,
for example discrete time zero

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:18.640
order hold or discrete time
first order hold, just as we

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:20.420
had in continuous time.

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:23.530
And the issues and analysis for
the discrete times zero

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:28.170
order hold and first order hold
are very similar to what

00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:30.950
they were in continuous time--
the zero order hold just

00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:34.340
simply holding the value until
the next sampling instant, and

00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:38.160
the first order hold carrying
out linear interpolation in

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:39.410
between the samples.

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:49.610
Now in this sampling process,
if we look again at the wave

00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:53.910
forms involved, or sequences
involved, the process

00:14:53.910 --> 00:15:01.090
consisted of taking a sequence
and extracting from it

00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:03.980
individual values.

00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:08.560
And in between those values,
we have sequence

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:10.930
values equal to 0.

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:18.030
So what we're doing in this
case is retaining the same

00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:21.950
number of sequence values and
simply setting some number of

00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:24.980
them equal to 0.

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:28.380
Well, let's say, for example,
that we want

00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:29.930
to carry out sampling.

00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:32.200
And what we're talking
about is a sequence.

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:36.170
And let's say this sequence is
stored in a computer memory.

00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:40.150
As you can imagine, the notion
of sampling it and actually

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:44.250
replacing some of the values
by zero is somewhat

00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:44.790
inefficient.

00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:47.550
Namely, it doesn't make sense
to think of storing in the

00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:50.900
memory a lot of zeros, when in
fact those are zeros that we

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:52.460
can always put back in.

00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:54.670
We know exactly what
the values are.

00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:57.920
And if we know what the sampling
rate was in discrete

00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:00.760
time, then we would know
when and how to put

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:03.070
the zeros back in.

00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:07.700
So actually, in discrete time
sampling, what we've talked

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:10.710
about so far is really
only one part or

00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:12.610
one step in the process.

00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:16.190
Basically, the other step is to
take those zeros and just

00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:18.820
throw them away because we could
put them in any time we

00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:22.790
want to and really only retain,
for example in our

00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:26.800
computer memory or list of
sequence values or whatever,

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:30.830
only retain the non-zero
values.

00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:34.540
So that process and the
resulting sequence that we end

00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:39.020
up with is associated with a
concept called decimation.

00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:42.050
What I mean by decimation
is very simple.

00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:47.200
What we're doing is, instead of
working with this sequence,

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:50.190
we're going to work with
this sequence.

00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:55.440
Namely, we'll toss out the
zeros in between here and

00:16:55.440 --> 00:17:00.270
collapse the sequence down only
to the sequence values

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:03.860
that are associated with
the original x of n.

00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:07.839
Now, in talking about a
decimated sequence, we could

00:17:07.839 --> 00:17:12.450
of course do that directly from
this step down to here,

00:17:12.450 --> 00:17:15.890
although again in the analysis
it will be somewhat more

00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:20.650
convenient to carry that out
by thinking, at least

00:17:20.650 --> 00:17:23.839
analytically, in terms
of a 2-step process--

00:17:23.839 --> 00:17:27.079
one being a sampling process,
then the other being a

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:28.079
decimation.

00:17:28.079 --> 00:17:32.930
But basically, this is a
decimated version of that.

00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:38.040
Now for the grammatical purists
out there, the word

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:40.620
decimation of course means
taking every tenth one.

00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:43.910
The implication is not that
we're always sampling with a

00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:45.220
period of 10.

00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:49.650
The idea of decimating is to
pick out every nth sample and

00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:53.390
end up with a collapsed
sequence.

00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:59.410
Let's now look at a little bit
of the analysis and understand

00:17:59.410 --> 00:18:02.870
what the consequence is in
the frequency domain.

00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:07.690
In particular what we want to
develop is how the Fourier

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:12.000
transform of the decimated
sequence is related to the

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.060
Fourier transform of the
original sequence or the

00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:16.540
sample sequence.

00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:19.125
So let's look at this in
the frequency domain.

00:18:21.730 --> 00:18:28.040
So what we have is a decimated
sequence, which consists of

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:32.250
pulling out every capital
Nth value of x of n.

00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:36.080
And of course that's the same as
we can either decimate x of

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:40.710
n or we can decimate
the sample signal.

00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:45.960
Now in going through this
analysis, I'll kind of go

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:49.520
through it quickly because again
there's the issue of

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:51.170
some slight mental gymnastics.

00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:55.400
And if you're anything like I
am, it's usually best to kind

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:58.390
of try to absorb that by
yourself quietly, rather than

00:18:58.390 --> 00:19:00.410
having somebody throw
it at you.

00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:03.640
Let me say, though, that the
steps that I'm following here

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:06.090
are slightly different
than the steps that

00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:07.120
I use in the text.

00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:11.250
It's a slightly different way of
going through the analysis.

00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:13.790
I guess you could say for one
thing that if we've gone

00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:16.560
through it twice, and it comes
out the same, well of course

00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:18.930
it has to be right.

00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:24.760
Well anyway, here we have then
the relationship between the

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:29.320
decimated sequence, the original
sequence, and the

00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:30.990
sampled sequence.

00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:34.260
And we know of course that the
Fourier transform of the

00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:38.560
sample sequence is just
simply this summation.

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:43.320
And now kind of the idea in the
analysis is that we can

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:51.020
collapse this summation by
recognizing that this term is

00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:55.420
only non-zero at every
nth value.

00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:58.200
And so if we do that,
essentially making a

00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:02.260
substitution of variables with
n equal to small m times

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:06.260
capital N, we can turn this
into a summation on m.

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:09.160
And that's what I've
done here.

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:13.170
And we've just simply used the
fact that we can collapse the

00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:18.340
sum because of the fact that
all but every nth value is

00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:20.080
equal to zero.

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:23.110
So this then is the Fourier
transform all

00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:25.590
of the sampled signal.

00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:29.920
And now if we look at the
Fourier transform of the

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:34.800
decimated signal, that Fourier
transform, of course, is this

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:38.680
summation on the decimated
sequence.

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:41.480
Well, what we want to look at is
the correspondence between

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:43.790
this equation and the
one above it.

00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:47.780
So we want to compare this
equation to this one.

00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:51.460
And recognizing that this
decimated sequence is just

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:59.070
simply related to the sample
sequence this way, these two

00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:02.960
become equal under a
substitution of variables.

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:09.090
In particular, notice that if
we replace in this equation

00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:14.650
omega by omega times capital
N, then these two equations

00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:16.740
become equal.

00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:20.180
So the consequence of that,
then, what it all boils down

00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:27.625
to and says, is that the
relationship between the

00:21:27.625 --> 00:21:30.360
Fourier transform of the
decimated sequence and the

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:34.680
Fourier transform of the sampled
sequence is simply a

00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:38.540
frequency scaling corresponding
to dividing the

00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:41.350
frequency axis by capital N.

00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:44.040
So that's essentially
what happens.

00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:45.680
That's really all that's
involved in

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:47.420
the decimation process.

00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:50.180
And now, again, let's look
at that pictorially

00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:52.550
and see what it means.

00:21:52.550 --> 00:21:55.780
So what we want to look at, now
that we've looked in the

00:21:55.780 --> 00:22:00.540
time domain in this particular
view graph, we now want to

00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:04.470
look in the frequency domain.

00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:11.620
And in the frequency domain,
we have, again, the Fourier

00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:17.470
transform of the original
sequence and we have the

00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:23.350
Fourier transform of the
sampled sequence.

00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:28.490
And now the Fourier transform
of the decimated sequence is

00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:35.030
simply this spectrum with a
linear frequency scaling.

00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:38.450
And in particular, it simply
corresponds to multiplying

00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:44.150
this frequency axis by capital
N. And notice that this

00:22:44.150 --> 00:22:48.840
frequency now, 2 pi over capital
N, that frequency ends

00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:55.800
up getting rescaled to
a frequency of 2 pi.

00:22:55.800 --> 00:23:00.980
So in fact now, in the
rescaling, it's that this

00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:07.200
point in the decimation gets
rescaled to this point.

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:10.480
And correspondingly, of course,
this whole spectrum

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:11.650
broadens out.

00:23:11.650 --> 00:23:14.770
Now we can also look at
that in the context of

00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:16.010
the original spectrum.

00:23:16.010 --> 00:23:19.130
And you can see that the
relationship between the

00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:22.020
original spectrum and the
spectrum of the decimated

00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:27.730
signal corresponds to simply
linearly scaling this.

00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:32.740
But it's important also to
keep in mind that that

00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:37.330
analysis, that particular
relationship, assumes that

00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:38.850
we've avoided aliasing.

00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:41.870
The relationship between the
spectrum of the decimated

00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:46.050
signal and the spectrum of the
sample signal is true whether

00:23:46.050 --> 00:23:47.700
or not we have aliasing.

00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:51.820
But being able to clearly
associate it with just simply

00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:56.480
scaling of this spectrum of the
original signal assumes

00:23:56.480 --> 00:24:00.380
that the spectrum of the
original signal, the shape of

00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:03.950
it, is preserved when we
generate the sample signal.

00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:11.870
Well, when might discrete time
sampling, and for that matter,

00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:14.080
decimation, be used?

00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:18.450
Well, I indicated one context in
which it might be useful at

00:24:18.450 --> 00:24:19.710
the beginning of this lecture.

00:24:19.710 --> 00:24:22.320
And let me now focus in
on that a little more

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:23.570
specifically.

00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:33.450
In particular, suppose that we
have gone through a process in

00:24:33.450 --> 00:24:39.730
which the continuous time signal
has been converted to a

00:24:39.730 --> 00:24:41.810
discrete time signal.

00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:44.200
And we then carry out
some additional

00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:45.690
discrete time filtering.

00:24:45.690 --> 00:24:49.060
So we have a situation where
we've gone through a

00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:52.710
continuous to discrete
time conversion.

00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:56.470
And after that conversion,
we carry out some

00:24:56.470 --> 00:24:58.035
discrete time filtering.

00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:03.940
And in particular, in going
through this part of the

00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:09.990
process, we choose the sampling
rate for going from

00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:13.710
the continuous time signal to
the sequence so that we don't

00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:15.750
violate the sampling theorem.

00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:19.500
Well let's suppose, then, that
this is the spectrum of the

00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:22.380
continuous time signal.

00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:27.170
Below it, we have the spectrum
of the output of the

00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:31.200
continuous to discrete
time conversion.

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:36.090
And I've chosen the sampling
frequency to be just high

00:25:36.090 --> 00:25:38.560
enough so that I
avoid aliasing.

00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:47.220
Well that then is the lowest
sampling frequency I can pick.

00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:51.860
But now, if we go through some
additional low pass filtering,

00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:53.580
then let's see what happens.

00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:59.790
If I now low pass filter the
sequence x of n, then in

00:25:59.790 --> 00:26:03.340
effect, I'm multiplying
the sequence

00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:06.490
spectrum by this filter.

00:26:06.490 --> 00:26:10.470
And so the result of that,
the product of the filter

00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:14.380
frequency response and the
Fourier transform of x of n

00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:20.130
would have a shape somewhat
like I indicate below.

00:26:20.130 --> 00:26:25.490
Now notice that in this
spectrum, although in the

00:26:25.490 --> 00:26:31.490
input to the filter this entire
band was filled up, in

00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:38.380
the output of the filter, there
is a band that in fact

00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:40.190
has zero energy in it.

00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:45.310
So what I can consider doing is
taking the output sequence

00:26:45.310 --> 00:26:49.590
from the filter and in fact
resampling it, in other words

00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:53.520
sampling it, which would be more
or less associated with a

00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:56.230
different sampling rate
for the continuous

00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:58.560
time signals involved.

00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:02.830
So I could now go through a
process which is commonly

00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:05.900
referred to as down sampling
that is lowering

00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:07.270
the sampling rate.

00:27:07.270 --> 00:27:10.570
When we do that, of course,
what's going to happen is that

00:27:10.570 --> 00:27:13.690
in fact this spectral
energy will now fill

00:27:13.690 --> 00:27:16.110
out more of the band.

00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:21.950
And for example, if this was a
third, then in fact if I down

00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:25.470
sampled by a factor of three,
then I would fill up the

00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:27.400
entire band with this energy.

00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:29.870
But since I've done some
additional low pass filtering,

00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:34.260
as I indicate here, there's
no problem with aliasing.

00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:38.230
If I had, let's say, down
sampled by a factor of three

00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:40.880
and I'm now taking that signal
and converting it back to a

00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:45.430
continuous time signal, then
of course the way I can do

00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:51.170
that is by simply running my
output clock for the discrete

00:27:51.170 --> 00:27:52.760
to continuous time converter.

00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:56.600
I can run my output clock
at a third the rate

00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:58.380
of the input clock.

00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:00.250
And that, in effect,
takes care of the

00:28:00.250 --> 00:28:01.500
bookkeeping for me.

00:28:03.930 --> 00:28:11.000
So here we have now the notion
of sampling a sequence, and

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.250
very closely tied in with that,
the notion of decimating

00:28:14.250 --> 00:28:19.000
a sequence, and related to both
of those, the notion of

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.630
down sampling, that is changing
the sampling rates so

00:28:22.630 --> 00:28:25.880
that, if we were trying this
in with continuous time

00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:30.170
signals, we've essentially
changed our clock rate.

00:28:30.170 --> 00:28:35.030
And we might also want to, and
it's important to, consider

00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:36.800
the opposite of that.

00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:41.140
So now a question is what's the
opposite of decimation.

00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:45.080
Suppose that we had a sequence
and we decimate it.

00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:49.470
Thinking about it as a 2-step
process, that would correspond

00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:52.170
to first multiplying by an
impulse train, where there are

00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:56.920
bunch of zeros in there, and
then choosing, throwing away

00:28:56.920 --> 00:29:00.880
the zeros and keeping only the
values that are non-zero,

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:03.370
because the zeros we can
always recreate.

00:29:03.370 --> 00:29:06.570
Well, in fact, the inverse
process is very specifically a

00:29:06.570 --> 00:29:10.955
process of recreating the
zeros and then doing the

00:29:10.955 --> 00:29:12.860
desampling.

00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:22.610
So in the opposite operation,
what we would do is undo the

00:29:22.610 --> 00:29:24.890
decimation step.

00:29:24.890 --> 00:29:28.330
And that would consist of
converting the decimated

00:29:28.330 --> 00:29:35.790
sequence back to an impulse
train and then processing that

00:29:35.790 --> 00:29:42.470
impulse train by an ideal low
pass filter to do the

00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:46.500
interpolation or reconstruction,
filling in the

00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:51.610
values which, in this impulse
train, are equal to zero.

00:29:51.610 --> 00:29:53.640
So we now have the two steps.

00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:56.490
We take the decimated sequence
and we expand it

00:29:56.490 --> 00:29:58.950
out, putting in zeros.

00:29:58.950 --> 00:30:03.380
And then we desample that by
processing it through a low

00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:05.150
pass filter.

00:30:05.150 --> 00:30:12.680
So just kind of looking at
sequences again, what we have

00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:18.360
is an original sequence,
the sequence x of n.

00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:23.510
And then the sample sequence
is simply a sequence which

00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:26.100
alternates, in this particular
case, those

00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:28.300
sequence values was zero.

00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:35.610
Here what we're assuming is that
the sampling period is 2.

00:30:35.610 --> 00:30:40.160
And so every other value
here is equal to zero.

00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:45.350
The decimated sequence then is
this sequence, collapsed as I

00:30:45.350 --> 00:30:48.400
show in the sequence above.

00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:52.960
And so it's, in effect, time
compressing the sample

00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:57.160
sequence or the original
sequence so that we throw out

00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:59.890
the sequence values which
were equal to zero

00:30:59.890 --> 00:31:02.500
in the sample sequence.

00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:06.270
Now in recovering the original
sequence from the decimated

00:31:06.270 --> 00:31:09.400
sequence, we can think
of a 2-step process.

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:15.640
Namely, we spread this out
alternating with zeros, and

00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:18.050
again, keeping in mind that
this is drawn for the case

00:31:18.050 --> 00:31:19.950
where capital N is 2.

00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:23.630
And then finally, we interpolate
between the

00:31:23.630 --> 00:31:28.700
non-zero values here by going
through a low pass filter to

00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:32.240
reconstruct the original
sequence.

00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:36.650
And that's what we show finally
on the bottom curve.

00:31:36.650 --> 00:31:39.730
So that's what we would see
in the time domain.

00:31:39.730 --> 00:31:43.950
Let's look at what we would see
in the frequency domain.

00:31:43.950 --> 00:31:48.860
In the frequency domain, we
have to begin with the

00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:52.020
sequence on the bottom, or the
spectrum on the bottom, which

00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:56.400
would correspond to the
original spectrum.

00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:59.710
Then, through the sampling
process, that is periodically

00:31:59.710 --> 00:32:00.910
replicated.

00:32:00.910 --> 00:32:04.990
Again, this is drawn on the
assumption that the sampling

00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:09.870
frequency is pi or the sampling
period is equal to 2.

00:32:09.870 --> 00:32:12.480
And so this is now replicated.

00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:17.310
And then, in going from this
to the spectrum of the

00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:23.990
decimated sequence, we would
rescale the frequency axis so

00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:29.590
that the frequency pi now gets
rescaled in the spectrum for

00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:34.090
the decimated sequence to a
frequency which is 2 pi.

00:32:34.090 --> 00:32:36.900
And so this now is
the spectrum of

00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:38.970
the decimated sequence.

00:32:38.970 --> 00:32:44.990
If we now want to reconvert to
the original sequence we would

00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:49.210
first intersperse in the
time domain with zeros,

00:32:49.210 --> 00:32:54.910
corresponding to compressing
in the frequency domain.

00:32:54.910 --> 00:32:58.610
This would then be low
pass filtered.

00:32:58.610 --> 00:33:02.680
And the low pass filtering would
consist of throwing away

00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:06.600
this replication, accounting
for a factor which is the

00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:10.630
factor capital N, and extracting
the portion of the

00:33:10.630 --> 00:33:16.680
spectrum which is associated
with the spectrum of the

00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:20.110
original signal which
we began with.

00:33:20.110 --> 00:33:24.420
So once again, we have
decimation and interpolation.

00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:30.150
And the decimation can be
thought of as a time

00:33:30.150 --> 00:33:34.250
compression that corresponds to
a frequency expansion then.

00:33:34.250 --> 00:33:37.890
And the interpolation process
is then just the reverse.

00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:45.130
Now there are lots of situations
in which decimation

00:33:45.130 --> 00:33:48.980
and interpolation and discrete
time sampling are useful.

00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:52.390
And one context that I just
want to quickly draw your

00:33:52.390 --> 00:33:56.480
attention to is the use of
decimation and interpolation

00:33:56.480 --> 00:34:00.030
in what is commonly referred
to as sampling rate

00:34:00.030 --> 00:34:01.480
conversion.

00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:05.710
What the basic issue and
sampling rate conversion is is

00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:10.650
that, in some situations, and
a very common one is digital

00:34:10.650 --> 00:34:15.330
audio, a continuous time
signal is sampled.

00:34:15.330 --> 00:34:18.850
And those sampled values
are stored or whatever.

00:34:18.850 --> 00:34:22.699
And kind of the notion is that,
perhaps when that is

00:34:22.699 --> 00:34:26.530
played back, it's played back
through a different system.

00:34:26.530 --> 00:34:31.350
And the different system has a
different assumed sampling

00:34:31.350 --> 00:34:33.480
frequency or sampling period.

00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:36.630
So that's kind of the
issue and the idea.

00:34:36.630 --> 00:34:41.090
We have, let's say, a continuous
time signal which

00:34:41.090 --> 00:34:45.070
we've converted to a sequence
through a sampling process

00:34:45.070 --> 00:34:48.830
using an assumed sampling
period of T1.

00:34:48.830 --> 00:34:54.420
And these sequence values may
then, for example, be put into

00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:55.710
digital storage.

00:34:55.710 --> 00:34:59.360
In the case of a digital audio
system, it may, for example,

00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:01.720
go onto a digital record.

00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:06.660
And it might be the output of
this that we want to recreate.

00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:11.350
Or we might in fact follow
that with some additional

00:35:11.350 --> 00:35:14.120
processing, whatever that
additional processing is.

00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:17.400
And I'll kind of put a question
mark in there because

00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:21.030
we don't know exactly
what that might be.

00:35:21.030 --> 00:35:25.900
And then, in any case, the
result of that is going to be

00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:30.540
converted back to a continuous
time signal.

00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:36.470
But it might be converted
through a system that has a

00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:40.660
different assumed
sampling period.

00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:44.950
And so a very common issue, and
it comes up as I indicated

00:35:44.950 --> 00:35:50.190
particularly in digital audio,
a very common issue is to be

00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:55.490
able to convert from one assumed
sampling period, T1,

00:35:55.490 --> 00:35:58.660
our sampling frequency,
to another

00:35:58.660 --> 00:36:00.780
assumed sampling period.

00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:02.120
Now how do we do that?

00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:07.460
Well in fact, we do that by
using the ideas of decimation

00:36:07.460 --> 00:36:09.140
and interpolation.

00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:14.110
In particular, if we had, for
example, a situation where we

00:36:14.110 --> 00:36:19.180
wanted to convert from a
sampling period, T1, to a

00:36:19.180 --> 00:36:24.210
sampling period which was twice
as long as that, then

00:36:24.210 --> 00:36:29.340
essentially, we're going to take
the sequence and process

00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:32.710
it in a way that would, in
effect, correspond to assuming

00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:36.190
that we had sampled at half
the original frequency.

00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:37.440
Well how do we do that?

00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:40.210
The way we do it is we take the
sequence we have and we

00:36:40.210 --> 00:36:43.460
just throw away every
other value.

00:36:43.460 --> 00:36:47.370
So in that case, we would then,
for this sampling rate

00:36:47.370 --> 00:36:51.560
conversion, down sample
and decimate.

00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:54.770
Or actually, we might not go
through this step formally.

00:36:54.770 --> 00:36:57.520
We might just simply decimate.

00:36:57.520 --> 00:37:02.590
Now we might have an alternative
situation where in

00:37:02.590 --> 00:37:05.680
fact the new sampling period, or
the sampling period of the

00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:09.230
output, is half the sampling
period of the input,

00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:13.670
corresponding to an assumed
sampling frequency, which is

00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:15.550
twice as high.

00:37:15.550 --> 00:37:20.010
And in that case, then., we
would go through a process of

00:37:20.010 --> 00:37:21.000
interpolation.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:25.730
And in particular, we would up
sample and interpolate by a

00:37:25.730 --> 00:37:27.780
factor of 2 to one.

00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:31.090
So in one case, we're
simply throwing

00:37:31.090 --> 00:37:32.260
away every other value.

00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:34.080
In the other case, what we're
going to do is take our

00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:37.630
sequence, put in zeros, put it
through a low pass filter to

00:37:37.630 --> 00:37:39.470
interpolate.

00:37:39.470 --> 00:37:43.300
Now life would be simple if
everything happened in simple

00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:45.070
integer amounts like that.

00:37:45.070 --> 00:37:49.690
A more common situation is that
we may have an assumed

00:37:49.690 --> 00:37:55.250
output sampling period
which is 3/2 of the

00:37:55.250 --> 00:37:57.250
input sampling period.

00:37:57.250 --> 00:38:00.530
And now the question is what are
we going to do to convert

00:38:00.530 --> 00:38:04.520
from this sampling period
to this sampling period.

00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:09.850
Well, in fact, the answer to
that is to use a combination

00:38:09.850 --> 00:38:13.090
of down sampling and up
sampling, or up sampling and

00:38:13.090 --> 00:38:17.470
down sampling, equivalently
interpolation and decimation.

00:38:17.470 --> 00:38:21.900
And for this particular case,
in fact, what we would do is

00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:28.630
to first take the data, up
sample by a factor of 2, and

00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:33.370
then down sample the result
of that by a factor of 3.

00:38:33.370 --> 00:38:37.290
And what that would give us is
a sampling rate conversion,

00:38:37.290 --> 00:38:42.750
overall, of 3/2, or a sampling
period conversion of 3/2.

00:38:42.750 --> 00:38:45.730
And more generally, what you
could think of is how you

00:38:45.730 --> 00:38:51.240
might do this if, in general,
the relationship between the

00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:54.090
input and output sampling
periods was some rational

00:38:54.090 --> 00:38:56.190
number p/q.

00:38:56.190 --> 00:39:00.350
And so in fact, in many systems,
in hardware systems

00:39:00.350 --> 00:39:04.370
related to digital audio, very
often the sampling rate

00:39:04.370 --> 00:39:07.160
conversion, most typically the
sampling rate conversion, is

00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:12.570
done through a process of up
sampling or interpolating and

00:39:12.570 --> 00:39:15.280
then down sampling by
some other amount.

00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:23.970
Now what we've seen, what we
talked about in a set of

00:39:23.970 --> 00:39:29.830
lectures, is the concepts
of sampling a signal.

00:39:29.830 --> 00:39:32.640
And what we've seen is that the
signal can be represented

00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:35.140
by samples under certain
conditions.

00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:38.240
And the sampling that we've been
talking about is sampling

00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:39.020
in the time domain.

00:39:39.020 --> 00:39:41.920
And we've done that for
continuous time and we've done

00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:45.150
it for discrete time.

00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:49.450
Now we know that there is some
type of duality both

00:39:49.450 --> 00:39:52.600
continuous time and discrete
time, some type of duality,

00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:55.240
between the time domain
and frequency domain.

00:39:55.240 --> 00:40:01.220
And so, as you can imagine, we
can also talk about sampling

00:40:01.220 --> 00:40:07.720
in the frequency domain and
expect that, more or less, the

00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:11.640
kinds of properties and analysis
will be similar to

00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:15.400
those related to sampling
in the time domain.

00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:21.020
Well I want to talk just briefly
about that and leave

00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:24.810
the more detailed discussion
to the text and

00:40:24.810 --> 00:40:26.550
video course manual.

00:40:26.550 --> 00:40:29.980
But let me indicate, for
example, one context in which

00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:32.370
frequency domain sampling
is important.

00:40:32.370 --> 00:40:38.220
Suppose that you have a signal
and what you'd like to measure

00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:41.770
is its Fourier transform,
its spectrum.

00:40:41.770 --> 00:40:46.130
Well of course, if you want to
measure it or calculate it,

00:40:46.130 --> 00:40:49.150
you can never do that exactly
at every single frequency.

00:40:49.150 --> 00:40:50.630
There are too many frequencies,
namely, an

00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:52.280
infinite number of them.

00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:55.670
And so, in fact, all that you
can really calculate or

00:40:55.670 --> 00:41:00.920
measure is the Fourier transform
at a set of sample

00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:02.170
frequencies.

00:41:02.170 --> 00:41:06.570
So essentially, if you are going
to look at a spectrum,

00:41:06.570 --> 00:41:09.950
continuous time or discrete
time, you can only really look

00:41:09.950 --> 00:41:11.060
at samples.

00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:15.210
And a reasonable question to
ask, then, is when does a set

00:41:15.210 --> 00:41:19.500
of samples in fact tell you
everything that there is to

00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:23.450
know about the Fourier
transform.

00:41:23.450 --> 00:41:27.100
That, and the answer to that, is
very closely related to the

00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:31.140
concept of frequency
domain sampling.

00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:33.770
Well, frequency domain sampling,
just to kind of

00:41:33.770 --> 00:41:37.900
introduce the topic, corresponds
and can be

00:41:37.900 --> 00:41:44.300
analyzed in terms doing
modulation in the frequency

00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:48.280
domain, very much like the
modulation that we carried out

00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:51.160
in the time domain for
time domain sampling.

00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:57.440
And so we would multiply the
Fourier transform of the

00:41:57.440 --> 00:42:02.200
signal whose spectrum is
to be sampled by an

00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:05.060
impulse train in frequency.

00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:10.520
And so shown below is what
might be a representative

00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:13.660
spectrum for the input signal.

00:42:13.660 --> 00:42:19.550
And the spectrum, then for the
signal associated with the

00:42:19.550 --> 00:42:23.760
frequency domain sampling,
consists of multiplying the

00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:27.670
frequency domain by this
impulse train.

00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:32.950
Or correspondingly, the Fourier
transform of the

00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:39.430
resulting signal is an impulse
train in frequency with an

00:42:39.430 --> 00:42:42.670
envelope which is the
original spectrum

00:42:42.670 --> 00:42:45.420
that we were sampling.

00:42:45.420 --> 00:42:48.360
Well, this of course is
what we would do in

00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:49.620
the frequency domain.

00:42:49.620 --> 00:42:52.560
It's modulation by
an impulse train.

00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:55.690
What does this mean in
the time domain?

00:42:55.690 --> 00:42:57.070
Well, let's see.

00:42:57.070 --> 00:42:59.690
Multiplication in the time
domain is convolution in the

00:42:59.690 --> 00:43:01.220
frequency domain.

00:43:01.220 --> 00:43:04.210
Convolution in the frequency
domain is multiplication--

00:43:04.210 --> 00:43:04.880
I'm sorry.

00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:07.700
Multiplication in the frequency
domain, then, is

00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:09.660
convolution in the
time domain.

00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:12.490
And in fact, the process
in the time domain is a

00:43:12.490 --> 00:43:14.120
convolution process.

00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:22.020
Namely, the time domain signal
is replicated at integer

00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:26.840
amounts of a particular time
associated with the spacing in

00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:29.050
frequency under which
we're doing the

00:43:29.050 --> 00:43:31.340
frequency domain sampling.

00:43:31.340 --> 00:43:39.590
So in fact, if we look at this
in the time domain, the

00:43:39.590 --> 00:43:46.170
resulting picture corresponds
to an original signal whose

00:43:46.170 --> 00:43:50.150
spectrum or Fourier transform
we've sampled.

00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:53.980
And a consequence of the
sampling is that the

00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:58.220
associated time domain signal
is just like the original

00:43:58.220 --> 00:44:02.490
signal, but periodically
replicated, in time now, not

00:44:02.490 --> 00:44:07.020
frequency, but in time, at
integer multiples of 2 pi

00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:12.720
divided by the spectral sampling
interval omega 0.

00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:18.050
And so this then is the time
function associated with the

00:44:18.050 --> 00:44:20.630
sample frequency function.

00:44:20.630 --> 00:44:24.640
Now, that's not surprising
because what we've done is

00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:27.750
generated an impulse
train and frequency

00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:29.660
with a certain envelope.

00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:32.460
We know that an impulse train
in frequency is the Fourier

00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:36.340
transform of a periodic
time function.

00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:39.180
And so in fact, we have a
periodic time function.

00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:43.240
We also know that the envelope
of those impulses--

00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:46.500
we know this from way back when
we talked about Fourier

00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:47.670
transforms--

00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:49.560
the envelope, in fact,
is the Fourier

00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:51.060
transform of one period.

00:44:51.060 --> 00:44:54.400
And so all of this, of course,
fits together as it should in

00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:56.620
a consistent way.

00:44:56.620 --> 00:45:02.340
Now given that we have this
periodic time function whose

00:45:02.340 --> 00:45:05.460
Fourier transform is the samples
in the frequency

00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:10.250
domain, how do we get back the
original time function?

00:45:10.250 --> 00:45:17.070
Well, with time domain sampling,
what we did was to

00:45:17.070 --> 00:45:21.370
multiply in the frequency domain
by a gate, or window,

00:45:21.370 --> 00:45:24.060
to extract that part
of the spectrum.

00:45:24.060 --> 00:45:29.080
What we do here is exactly the
same thing, namely multiply in

00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:34.650
the time domain by a time window
which extracts just one

00:45:34.650 --> 00:45:38.280
period of this periodic signal,
which would then give

00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:42.930
us back the original signal
that we started with.

00:45:42.930 --> 00:45:48.550
Now also let's keep in mind,
going back to this time

00:45:48.550 --> 00:45:52.400
function and the relationship
between them, then again,

00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:56.090
there is the potential, if this
time function is too long

00:45:56.090 --> 00:46:00.780
in relation to 2 pi divided by
omega 0, there's the potential

00:46:00.780 --> 00:46:02.420
for these to overlap.

00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:06.880
And so what this means is that,
in fact, what we can end

00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:11.320
up with, if the sample spacing
and the frequency is not small

00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:15.100
enough, what we can end up
with is an overlap in the

00:46:15.100 --> 00:46:17.530
replication in the
time domain.

00:46:17.530 --> 00:46:21.220
And what that corresponds to
and what it's called is, in

00:46:21.220 --> 00:46:23.200
fact, time aliasing.

00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:27.590
So we can have time aliasing
with frequency domain sampling

00:46:27.590 --> 00:46:30.440
just as we can have
frequency aliasing

00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:33.440
with time domain sampling.

00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:37.730
Finally, let me just indicate
very quickly that, although

00:46:37.730 --> 00:46:41.780
we're not going through this in
any detail, the same basic

00:46:41.780 --> 00:46:44.820
idea applies in discrete time.

00:46:44.820 --> 00:46:50.280
Namely, if we have a discrete
time signal and if the

00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:55.870
discrete time signal is a finite
length, if we sample

00:46:55.870 --> 00:47:01.260
its Fourier transform, the time
function associated with

00:47:01.260 --> 00:47:05.980
those samples is a periodic
replication.

00:47:05.980 --> 00:47:11.270
And we can now extract, from
this periodic signal, the

00:47:11.270 --> 00:47:16.080
original signal by multiplying
by an appropriate time window,

00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:19.660
the product of that giving
us the reconstructed time

00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:21.630
function as I indicate below.

00:47:24.730 --> 00:47:29.100
So we've now seen a little bit
of the notion of frequency

00:47:29.100 --> 00:47:31.690
domain sampling, as well as
time domain sampling.

00:47:31.690 --> 00:47:34.440
And let me stress that, although
I haven't gone into

00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:38.800
this in a lot of detail,
it's important.

00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:40.510
It's used very often.

00:47:40.510 --> 00:47:43.020
It's naturally important
to understand it.

00:47:43.020 --> 00:47:46.550
But, in fact, there is so much
duality between the time

00:47:46.550 --> 00:47:49.460
domain and frequency domain,
that a thorough understanding

00:47:49.460 --> 00:47:53.270
of time domain sampling just
naturally leads to a thorough

00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:55.520
understanding of frequency
domain sampling.

00:47:58.810 --> 00:48:01.680
Now we've talked a lot
about sampling.

00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:06.840
And this now concludes our
discussion of sampling.

00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:10.170
I've stressed many times in the
lectures associated with

00:48:10.170 --> 00:48:16.020
this that sampling is a very
important topic in the context

00:48:16.020 --> 00:48:19.440
of our whole discussion, in part
because it forms such an

00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:22.520
important bridge between
continuous time and discrete

00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:23.890
time ideas.

00:48:23.890 --> 00:48:27.150
And your picture now should kind
of be a global one that

00:48:27.150 --> 00:48:31.060
sees how continuous time and
discrete time fit together,

00:48:31.060 --> 00:48:33.395
not just analytically,
but also practically.

00:48:36.510 --> 00:48:42.560
Beginning in the next lecture,
what I will introduce is the

00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:46.740
Laplace transform and, beyond
that, the Z transform.

00:48:46.740 --> 00:48:51.460
And what those will correspond
to are generalizations of the

00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:52.930
Fourier transform.

00:48:52.930 --> 00:48:55.730
So we now want to turn our
attention back to some

00:48:55.730 --> 00:48:59.270
analytical tools, in particular
developing some

00:48:59.270 --> 00:49:03.830
generalizations of the Fourier
transform in both continuous

00:49:03.830 --> 00:49:05.780
time and discrete time.

00:49:05.780 --> 00:49:11.140
And what we'll see is that those
generalizations provide

00:49:11.140 --> 00:49:16.510
us with considerably enhanced
flexibility in dealing with

00:49:16.510 --> 00:49:21.210
and analyzing both signals and
linear time invariant systems.

00:49:21.210 --> 00:49:22.460
Thank you.
