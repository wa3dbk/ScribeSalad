00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:23.520
PROFESSOR: So, our first
question here is about

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.550
limiting reactants.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.620
So, that's something you will
encounter in your review

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.410
reading for the sections, that
kind of review -- what we hope

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.220
you have picked up from high
school or will pick up quickly

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:34.780
by doing some review.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.140
So, how about we have everyone
take ten more seconds on the

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:59.090
clicker question, get your
final answer in here.

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.460
All right.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.230
So, let's see what we have.

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.240
All right, so it looks like
we weren't showing the

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:08.700
percentages here, but it looks
like hopefully most of you

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.990
were able to get the correct
answer of H2 being the

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.220
limiting reactant.

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.060
It looks like we're still
figuring out -- this room was

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.930
just renovated, we're still
working out exactly how the

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:19.870
electronics work.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:21.910
So, normally we'll see a
percentage of how many of you

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.600
got it, but I'm going to say it
was probably about 95% got

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.610
the answer right.

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.420
So, good job there.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.590
If you didn't get the answer
right -- we'll send these

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:31.860
questions to your TA, so any
time you get a clicker

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.340
question wrong and you're
confused, bring it up in the

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.080
next recitation section
and you'll be able

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.650
to discuss it there.

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.480
So, starting in, we can switch
over to the to the notes now.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.050
When we left off on Wednesday,
what we had really been doing

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.480
is trying to give you an
overview of all of the

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.850
different topics that
we're going to be

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.200
going over this semester.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.400
And also, to make a couple of
those connections between the

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.430
principles we're learning, and
some of the exciting research

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.060
that's going on at MIT in the
Chemistry Department, and

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.170
also, to give you the idea that
we are going to be trying

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.040
to make these connections
between the chemistry and

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.880
things like human health
or medicine.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.600
So, now we get to actually take
a step back and start at

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.560
the beginning, because before we
can talk about some of the

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.250
more complex issues, which
involve interactions between

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.590
molecules reacting or even
when we're talking about

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.490
individual molecules -- the
bonds that form between

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.670
individual atoms -- before any
of that we actually need to

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.390
establish a way that we're going
to describe and think

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.590
about how an individual
atom behaves.

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.980
And the way that we'll do this
is starting with talking about

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:48.070
the discovery of the electron
and the nucleus here.

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.660
Once we go through that, we
will be able to talk about

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.880
describing an atom using
classical physics.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.560
So, once we have an atom and a
nucleus, what we'll try to do

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.290
is apply the classical
mechanics to

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.310
explain how that behaves.

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.080
What we'll find is that this
fails, and once this fails

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.710
we're going to need
another option.

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:13.640
Luckily for us, we have quantum
mechanics, which we'll

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.280
be talking about for the
next few lectures, and

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.470
we'll dive into that.

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.280
We might get a chance to
introduce it today, but

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.780
certainly in next class we'll
be introducing this new kind

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.790
of mechanics that's going
to allow to describe

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:24.620
the behavior of atoms.

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.990
So, I want to point out that it
makes a lot of sense for us

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:32.460
to start with the discovery of
the electron and the nucleus,

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.020
because it really highlights
one of the big issues that

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:38.460
comes up in all chemistry
research that you do, and that

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:43.190
is how do we actually study,
or in this case, how do we

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:47.590
discover atoms or sub-particles
that we actually

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:48.820
can't see at all.

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.400
And there are lots of solutions
that chemists come

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.400
up with -- there's always new
techniques that allow us to do

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.560
this, and these are just some
of the first, and we'll go

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.680
through them in a little
bit of detail here.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.370
So, this all starts, in terms
of putting it in its

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.190
historical context at the turn
of the Century, we said we'd

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.410
start right in on the
20th Century of

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:09.620
where chemistry was.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.230
And where we where at the start
of the 20th Century in

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.450
the late 1890's is that we were
at a place where there

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.380
was great confidence in our
understanding of the universe,

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.710
and our understanding of
how all matter worked.

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:24.600
So, people in the chemistry
community and in the physics

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.690
community had this general
feeling that the theoretical

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.650
structure of the entire universe
was pretty well

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:31.620
understood.

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.435
And they had this feeling
because there had just been

00:04:34.435 --> 00:04:38.300
this huge boon of discovery,
of scientific advances that

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.040
included Newtonian mechanics,
it included Dalton's atomic

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.080
theory of matter, also
thermodynamics and classical

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.130
electromagnetism.

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:49.090
So, you can understand they
really felt quite confident at

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.080
this time that we could explain
everything that was

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.070
going on, and in fact, a really
telling quote from the

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.740
time was said by a professor at
the University of Chicago,

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.760
and what he said is, "Our future
discoveries must be

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.430
looked for in the sixth
decimal place."

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:10.700
So, basically what he's saying
here is we pretty much

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:13.870
understand what's going on,
there's nothing new to really

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:19.380
discover, all we need to do is
measure things more precisely.

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:24.900
So, that's not exactly the case,
and we're going to start

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.040
in at the point where right
around this time of great

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:31.590
confidence of feeling all has
been conquered, there are some

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:34.610
observations and discoveries
that are made that completely

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:36.170
break down these theories.

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:39.780
For example, in terms of the
atomic theory of matter, at

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.900
the time at the turn of the
Century, the understanding was

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:47.020
that atoms were the most basic
constituent of matter, meaning

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.790
you couldn't break atoms up into
anything smaller -- that

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:51.150
was it, you're done.

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.570
And with using Newtonian
mechanics, it was assumed

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:58.210
since this type of mechanics
worked so well to describe

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:00.355
everything we could see, it
could even describe the

00:06:00.355 --> 00:06:03.390
universe and planets, that, of
course, we could use Newtonian

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:07.310
mechanics to describe how an
electron -- actually, we

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:09.400
didn't even know about an
electron here, but how atoms

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:14.310
behaved, and it turns out this
is not the case, and the first

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:18.030
step in discovering this is not
the case, was accomplished

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:21.620
by J.J. Thomson, and J.J.
Thomson is credited for

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:24.230
discovering the electron.

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:28.590
He was a physicist in England,
and what his laboratory was

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:32.970
studying is something called
cathode rays, and cathode rays

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:36.150
are simply rays that are emitted
when you have a high

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:39.970
voltage difference between
two electrodes.

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:45.000
So, if you look at this set up,
what he did when he was

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.440
studying these rays is he had
an evacuated tube, which is

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.904
schematically shown here, where
it's evacuated of all

00:06:50.904 --> 00:06:55.260
it's air and filled instead just
with hydrogen gas, and he

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.740
had this high voltage difference
between an anode

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:01.200
and a cathode, and he actually
put a little hole in the anode

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:04.760
here, so these cathode rays that
were produced could shoot

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:08.340
out of the cathode and actually
could be detected as

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:11.850
this luminescent spot on
a detector screen.

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:14.020
So, lots of people were studying
cathode rays at the

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:17.320
time -- one reason is they
actually gave off this bright

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:19.580
glow -- if you put them in an
evacuated glass tube, you got

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:22.780
these crazy patterns
and glowing colors.

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:25.730
So, for that reason
it was a very hot

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:27.680
issue in terms of research.

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:30.870
But also, no one really knew
what these were and Thomson

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:34.960
was seeking to figure out some
more properties of them, and

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:38.150
he had the theory that maybe
they were actually charged

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:41.410
particles of some sort, and
others had proposed this in

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:43.790
the past, but they didn't really
have an experimental

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:44.780
set up to test it.

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:47.370
And that's what Thomson did.

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:50.680
And what we did was he put two
detection plates on either

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:55.240
side of these cathode rays,
and when he put a voltage

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.710
difference between these two
plates, he wanted to see if he

00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:00.380
could actually bend the rays and
test if they're actually

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:01.620
charged or not.

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:04.035
So, when the voltage difference
between the plates

00:08:04.035 --> 00:08:07.440
is zero, or when we just don't
have the plates there at all,

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:10.450
the cathode rays are not bent,
they just go right in a

00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:15.000
straight line, and they can be
detected on this screen.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.260
When he actually cranked up the
voltage between these two

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.850
plates, what he saw was really
amazing to him, which is that

00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:24.880
he actually was able to bend
these rays -- this had never

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:28.550
been observed before in any
capacity, and he was able to

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:31.660
detect on his screen that there
was this deflection, and

00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:33.730
he could even measure
the degree of the

00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:35.840
deflection that he had.

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:38.880
So, we know now that we have
charged particles.

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:41.620
Are these negatively or
positively charged, based on

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:41.800
this evidence?

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:43.580
STUDENT: Negatively.

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:44.400
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's right.

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:48.300
So, what we have here, cathode
rays we now know are

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:51.270
negatively charged particles.

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:56.290
And, in fact, he named these
negatively charged particles.

00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:59.140
Does anyone know what
he named them?

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:01.520
No, not electrons --
very good guess.

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:03.140
He named them corpuscles.

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:05.750
Has anyone heard
of corpuscles?

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:07.080
A little bit.

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:10.420
Yeah, so it was later named that
these particles were, in

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:13.120
fact, electrons, and that's
what they are.

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:15.920
J.J. Thomson continued to call
them corpuscles for many,

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:18.040
many, many years after everyone
else called them

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:21.010
electrons, but I'm sure no one
minded because he did, in

00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:22.680
fact, discover them.

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:25.900
And he was actually able to find
out more than just that

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:27.670
these were charged.

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:29.940
From classical electromagnetism,
he could

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:33.400
actually relate the degree of
deflection that he saw to the

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:36.970
charge and the mass
of the particles.

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:41.210
So, using that he could say that
delta x, and we'll put

00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:43.670
sub-negative, because we know
now that these are negative

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:53.370
particles, is proportional to
the charge on that particle

00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:55.230
over m, which is the mass.

00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:59.540
So, we have e being equal to
the charge of the negative

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:05.100
particles, and m, of course,
is equal to the

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:08.990
mass of those particles.

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:13.910
So, Thomson didn't stop here,
he actually continued

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:16.150
experimenting with different
voltages.

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:21.050
And what he found was if he
really, really ramped the

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:25.200
voltage up between those two
plates, he could actually

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.810
detect something else.

00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:30.310
And what he could detect here is
that there was this little

00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:33.630
spot of luminescence that he
could see on the screen that

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:37.520
was barely deflected at all --
certainly in comparison to how

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:39.530
strongly this first particle
was deflected.

00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:44.220
The second particle was
deflected almost not at all.

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:47.150
But what he could tell from
the fact that there was a

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:49.550
second particle at all, and the
fact that it was in this

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:53.100
direction, is that in addition
to his negative particle, he

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:56.390
also, of course, had a positive
particle that was

00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:58.690
within this stream of rays
that were coming out.

00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:02.590
So, of course, he can use the
same relationship for the

00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:08.640
positive particle, so delta
x now of the positive is

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:14.960
proportional to the charge on
the positive particle all over

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:18.910
the mass of the positive
particle.

00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:21.880
So, this is interesting
for several reasons.

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:26.680
What did he manage to pull out
information-wise from using

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:28.020
these two relationships?

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:31.290
And actually to do this, he made
a few more observations.

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:33.950
The first, which I just stated,
is that the deflection

00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:37.620
of that negative particle was
just far and away more

00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:39.950
extreme, much, much larger
than that of

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:42.360
the positive particle.

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:45.770
The other assumption that he
made here is that the charge

00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:47.870
on the two particles
was equal.

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:49.700
So, how could he know that
the charge on the two

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:51.020
particles was equal?

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:53.120
And actually he couldn't exactly
know it -- it was a

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:56.920
very good assumption that he
made, and he could make the

00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:00.110
assumption because he, in fact,
did know that what he

00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:02.890
started with was this
hydrogen gas.

00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:04.900
So, he was starting
with hydrogen.

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:08.900
If some negative particle was
popping out from the hydrogen,

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:13.020
then what he must be left with
is h-plus, and since hydrogen

00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:17.040
itself is neutral, the h-plus
and the electron had to add up

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:18.220
to be a neutral charge.

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:21.020
So, that means the charges of
the two pieces, the positive

00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:23.760
and negative particle,
must be equal in

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:27.250
terms of absolute charge.

00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:30.820
So, using this relationship, he
could then actually figure

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:35.130
out by knowing, which he knows
how much each of them were

00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:40.820
deflected, he could now try to
think about whether or not he

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:44.300
could make some relationship
between the masses -- between

00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:48.510
the mass of the positive and
the negative particle.

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:53.150
So, this relationship he was
looking at was starting with

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:58.720
the deflection, and the absolute
distance that the

00:12:58.720 --> 00:12:59.830
particles were deflected.

00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:03.660
So, what he could set that equal
to is he knows what x is

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:07.090
proportional to in terms of
the negative particle, so

00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:12.360
that's just the absolute value
of the charge over the mass of

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:13.510
the negative particle.

00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:20.340
He could divide all of that by
the absolute value of the

00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:24.450
charge of the positive particle,
all over the mass of

00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:26.780
the positive particle.

00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:29.640
And as we said, he made the
assumption that those two

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:32.350
charges were equal, so
we can go ahead and

00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:34.190
cross those right out.

00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:37.130
So, what that told him was if
he knew the relationship

00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:40.400
between how far they were each
displaced, he could also know

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:41.150
something about the

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:44.180
relationship of the two masses.

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:48.130
So essentially, there was an
inversely proportional

00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:51.960
relationship between how far the
particles were displaced,

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:56.450
and what the mass of the two
particles turned out to be.

00:13:56.450 --> 00:14:00.290
So, because he, of course,
observed that the negative

00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:02.990
particle travelled -- it was
deflected much, much further

00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:06.710
by those plates, what he could
also assume and make the

00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:11.490
conclusion of is that the mass
of that negative particle is

00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:13.450
actually larger or smaller?

00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:15.100
STUDENT: Smaller.

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:19.210
PROFESSOR: Much, much smaller,
exactly, then the mass of the

00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:20.440
positive particle.

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:23.620
So essentially, what he found
here is the relationship

00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:28.080
between the mass of an electron
and the mass of the

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:31.090
rest of the atom, the rest of
the hydrogen atom there, which

00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:32.740
is an ion in this case.

00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:36.940
And, in fact, it's so much
smaller, it's close to 2,000

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:41.480
times smaller, that we can
make the assumption that

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:44.480
essentially the electrons
take up no mass.

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:47.140
I mean they take up a teeny
bit, but essentially, when

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:50.390
we're thinking about the set up
of the atom, we don't have

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:53.070
to account for them as using
up a lot of the mass we're

00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:55.610
discussing.

00:14:55.610 --> 00:15:00.360
So, Thomson came up with a
model for the atom due to

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:03.370
this, and this is called the
Plum Pudding model of the

00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:08.600
atom, and he was, as we said,
English, so plum pudding is

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:10.100
kind of a British food.

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:13.360
Has anyone here ever
had plum pudding?

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:14.240
A couple of people.

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:14.860
Okay.

00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:17.880
I've never even seen it, so
that's good -- you must be

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:19.660
better travelled than I.

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:23.170
So, the idea that he had here
was he treated the whole of

00:15:23.170 --> 00:15:34.480
the atom as sort of this
positive pudding, so the

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:37.480
majority of the atom was just
kind of this goopy, positive

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:40.340
stuff that you could think
about, and within the pudding,

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:44.280
he had all these negative
charges, which were the

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:48.910
electrons, and they were the
raisins or the plums that were

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:50.230
in the pudding.

00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:54.500
So this was a revolutionary
model of an atom when we

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:57.070
thought of the fact that before
this experiment, the

00:15:57.070 --> 00:15:59.600
understanding was an atom could
not be divisible into

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:03.040
smaller parts, and now here we
are with subatomic particles

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:08.500
with electrons, and this
wonderful Plum Pudding model.

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:10.880
So, for those of you that
haven't actually had plum

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:13.080
pudding, which myself
is included, I threw

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:15.050
a picture up here.

00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:18.020
This was my first glance at plum
pudding, and I guess you

00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:22.280
can see that this must be that
positive part -- most of the

00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:25.660
plums are within that, and you
can see all these little

00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:29.750
raisins or plums in here, that
would be that negative charge.

00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:32.850
So, that already was a big
advancement from where the

00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:34.370
understanding was at the time.

00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:37.990
We already moved way forward and
completely revolutionizing

00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:40.550
the understanding of an atom in
that there's something in

00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:44.380
an atom -- it's not the smallest
thing there is.

00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:47.950
However, as you know, we
didn't stop at the plum

00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:50.460
pudding model, which is good,
because it's a little goofy,

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:53.870
so it's nice to move on from
that and move on we did.

00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:58.180
About 10 to 15 years later,
another physicist, Ernest

00:16:58.180 --> 00:17:02.820
Rutherford, actually put this
plum pudding model to test,

00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:06.170
and he did it through studies
that he'd been doing on

00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:08.670
radiation that was emitting
something

00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:11.460
called alpha particles.

00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:14.940
So, Rutherford, some of you may
recognize that name, is a

00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:18.820
very famous physicist who made
a lot of contributions in

00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:20.610
terms of radioactivity.

00:17:20.610 --> 00:17:23.080
When he was studying these
alpha particles, he was

00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:25.290
actually the first person to
identify the difference

00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:28.530
between different types of
particles that radioactive

00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:30.400
materials emit.

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:34.030
And he got this particular
material that he was studying,

00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:37.150
radium bromide from his good
friend, Marie Curie, who,

00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:42.650
obviously, also was a leader,
really the leader in figuring

00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:45.350
out much of how radioactive
materials work.

00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:47.850
She has two Nobel Prizes
for her work

00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:50.360
in radioactive materials.

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:53.540
And something that maybe many
of you think, which I know I

00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:57.120
always think when I hear about
radioactivity studies in the

00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:01.195
early 1900's, is oh, my gosh,
this sounds really dangerous,

00:18:01.195 --> 00:18:04.470
right, they're using radium
bromide, and this is pretty

00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:06.720
dangerous radioactive
material.

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:10.300
So, for those of you that don't
know radium is extremely

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:14.640
radioactive, even in the range
of radioactivity, and one of

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:17.250
the major problems with it is
that if it does get in your

00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:21.020
body, the radium is treated
as calcium in your body.

00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:23.910
So, you can imagine what happens
as it gets deposited

00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:28.330
into your bones, which is not
the ideal situation after a

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:30.390
long day in the lab.

00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:33.650
So, this is really a pretty
dangerous situation that's

00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:35.080
always interesting
to point out.

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:37.410
He got this from Marie Curie --
you can imagine they used

00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:39.410
the postal service, I'm not sure
how else they would have

00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:41.380
transferred it to each other.

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:44.320
So, it really brings
up some issues.

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:48.540
The first thing I did when I
heard that is actually look up

00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:53.080
to see how, in fact, Ernest
Rutherford did die in 1937,

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:54.430
and you'll be happy to know,
it actually wasn't from

00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:57.610
radiation poisoning or from bone
cancer, so that's really

00:18:57.610 --> 00:19:03.880
good that that worked out okay
for him, and that he did get

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:07.010
to, sort of safely, at least
end his life before the

00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:08.190
radiation ended it.

00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:10.960
But it's really interesting
the studies that he did do

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:13.430
with radium bromide, and he was

00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:15.340
studying the alpha particles.

00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:18.280
And what was known about alpha
particles at the time is that

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:20.230
they were these charged
particles and that they were

00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:21.460
very heavy.

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:23.950
Does anyone know more than what
Rutherford knew at the

00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:27.590
time, what alpha particles
actually are?

00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:28.380
Yeah, good.

00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:30.940
So, they're actually helium
atoms, helium ions.

00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:35.060
And this wasn't really important
for the studies, it

00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:37.720
didn't matter that didn't know
what they are, but it's nice

00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:41.390
to kind of know now -- that we
do know what they were using.

00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:44.820
And he was doing quite a
few studies with them.

00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:48.840
One experiment that he was doing
is detecting the number

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:52.160
of particles that were being
emitted by this radium bromide

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:54.920
as a rate, so he would measure
the number of particles per

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:58.580
minute that the radium
bromide was emitting.

00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:02.570
And what he used was a detector
here, so he here

00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:04.760
could detect how many
particles were

00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:06.250
hitting this detector.

00:20:06.250 --> 00:20:10.340
He had actually developed this
detector with a postdoc by the

00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:11.170
name of Hans Geiger.

00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:14.430
Does that name ring a bell?

00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:15.020
STUDENT: Geiger counter.

00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:15.410
PROFESSOR: Um-hmm,
a Geiger counter.

00:20:15.410 --> 00:20:20.750
So, this, in fact, is my very
schematic representation of a

00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:21.730
Geiger counter.

00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:24.320
For those of you don't know what
that is, it's simply an

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:29.430
instrument that counts
radioactive particles in the

00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:33.110
air, and now that you're at MIT,
you'll all have a chance

00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:35.250
to see one first hand, if you're
ever in any of the

00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:38.370
labs, especially in the
chemistry or bio labs.

00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:42.160
As carefully as people work with
radioactivity here, and

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:45.000
using often much, much safer
radioactive materials than

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.860
radium bromide, and using them,
and special hoods, and

00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:50.100
having special procedures,
they still do a lot of

00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:52.040
checking with these Geiger
counters to make sure

00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:53.340
everything's safe.

00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:55.870
You'll actually see a man
walking around with one,

00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:58.450
sometimes in the halls, just
kind of like this -- you hear

00:20:58.450 --> 00:21:01.650
that click, click, click.

00:21:01.650 --> 00:21:05.160
That's a good sound, it means
low levels of radiation.

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:08.770
He'll walk by your hood, so
click by your hood --

00:21:08.770 --> 00:21:11.060
I always get a little nervous
when he walked by my hood, I

00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:14.250
don't know why, I never worked
with radioactive material.

00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:16.500
But I was convinced
I'd hear the

00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:18.320
click-click-click-click-click,
which is what tells you you're

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:20.240
in trouble.

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:22.780
So, I've never heard the
click-click-click-click-click,

00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:25.400
and we might bring a Geiger
counter in here some time

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:28.440
later in the semester so we can
check all of you out, and

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:31.730
hopefully we won't hear any
when we do that either.

00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:33.990
So, one thing that he discovered
with this detector

00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:37.090
initially, and he was the first
to discover this, is

00:21:37.090 --> 00:21:40.700
that radioactive material,
including radium bromide, have

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:45.350
a characteristic rate that they
emit, radioactive decay.

00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:48.250
So basically they're decaying
at a constant rate, which

00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:53.820
means, of course, that you can
figure out how old things are

00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:56.050
by seeing how much
they've decayed.

00:21:56.050 --> 00:21:58.480
So, he was really the first
person to discover you could

00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:02.690
do this, which was used to make
the first somewhat close

00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:04.490
approximation of the
age of the earth.

00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:07.860
So that's a pretty exciting
set of experiments he did.

00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:10.215
But one thing that he wanted
to do specific to

00:22:10.215 --> 00:22:13.580
understanding the atom, and
using these alpha particles,

00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:16.800
these heavy-charged particles,
was to test if this Plum

00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:21.370
Pudding model actually fit
what he could observe.

00:22:21.370 --> 00:22:24.710
So, what he did was he first
recorded the count rate of

00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:28.440
radium bromide before it's going
through any kind of a

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:31.250
plum pudding atom, and he found
that it had a count rate

00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:36.190
of 132,000 alpha particles per
minute were being detected by

00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:39.480
this Geiger counter.

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:43.310
He then set up a situation where
he put a very, very thin

00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:47.620
piece of gold foil right in what
would be in the stream of

00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:49.120
the alpha particles.

00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:53.010
So, it was only 10 to the
negative, 9 meters thick, so

00:22:53.010 --> 00:22:56.320
about one nanometer, so that's
really thin, it's thinner than

00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:57.500
a strand of hair.

00:22:57.500 --> 00:23:00.410
So you can imagine, we actually
don't need to think

00:23:00.410 --> 00:23:03.060
of it as a piece of gold foil,
it might be easier to think of

00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:05.680
it as a couple of
layers of atoms.

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:09.960
So basically he's trying to put
some atoms in the way of

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:12.000
the alpha particle.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.340
And what he would expect is if
this Plum Pudding model is

00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:20.450
true, nothing's really going
to happen to the particles,

00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:22.470
right, they should go straight
through, because if they hit

00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:24.140
an electron, those
are so small.

00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:27.510
We figured out the mass is so
tiny that it shouldn't really

00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:29.310
deflect them very much.

00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:33.240
And, of course, all that's left
is this positive pudding.

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:35.560
So that's not going to
do anything either.

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:38.855
And what he found when he did
this experiment, was that the

00:23:38.855 --> 00:23:45.950
count rate with still 132,000
counts per minute.

00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:49.570
So, what he could conclude thus
far was that this was

00:23:49.570 --> 00:23:52.360
really consistent with the
Plum Pudding model.

00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:56.300
All of his heavily-charged alpha
particles were going

00:23:56.300 --> 00:24:00.340
right through this thin
layer of gold atoms.

00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:02.710
So, you might think that he
would stop his experiments

00:24:02.710 --> 00:24:05.660
here, and maybe he would have,
but as I mentioned, he did

00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:08.410
have a postdoc working with
him by the name of Geiger.

00:24:08.410 --> 00:24:13.380
He also had an undergraduate, we
could say maybe even a UROP

00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:18.420
working with him, and this was
by the name of Marsden was the

00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:19.250
name of this UROP.

00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:23.740
And Rutherford realized, you
know I have these two people

00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:26.750
that are very excited to work on
this project, I don't need

00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:27.810
to spend time doing it.

00:24:27.810 --> 00:24:30.440
Maybe it's not the best way for
me to spend time looking

00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:33.760
to see if I can find any
bounced-back particles since

00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:35.770
all the particles are
accounted for.

00:24:35.770 --> 00:24:38.600
But, you know, this
undergraduate's very eager to

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:41.710
do it, let's let
him have a try.

00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:45.060
And something you might find in
your UROP experience is you

00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:47.820
have a unique advantage as an
undergraduate, which is that

00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:50.880
there's not a lot of pressure
to actually make a huge

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:53.770
discovery or necessarily
accomplish a great amount.

00:24:53.770 --> 00:24:56.330
You have a little more pressure
in grad school, but

00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:58.610
sometimes that means when
you're an undergrad your

00:24:58.610 --> 00:25:01.790
advisor will decide to put you
on projects that maybe when

00:25:01.790 --> 00:25:03.990
you look at them seem
a little bit silly.

00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:08.130
So this project was, let's see
if we can detect any alpha

00:25:08.130 --> 00:25:11.770
particles by making a detector
that swings around.

00:25:11.770 --> 00:25:14.150
So, some people might say,
why are we doing this?

00:25:14.150 --> 00:25:17.660
We know we started with a
132,000 alpha particles.

00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:21.330
We detected a 132,000
alpha particles.

00:25:21.330 --> 00:25:23.010
What are we even looking for?

00:25:23.010 --> 00:25:25.280
We have to build this whole new
detector, is this really

00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:26.790
the best use of my time?

00:25:26.790 --> 00:25:29.050
As an undergrad, you don't have
to worry about it, you're

00:25:29.050 --> 00:25:30.420
just worried about learning.

00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:33.370
You can take these big risks of
time, and if at the end of

00:25:33.370 --> 00:25:35.960
the day there's nothing to
detect, you still know how to

00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:37.050
build a detector.

00:25:37.050 --> 00:25:39.820
So, keep that in mind if
you're not over-the-top

00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:42.260
excited about the prospects
of some of your research.

00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:43.900
You might be surprised
at what you find out.

00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:47.340
And this is exactly what
happened with Marsden who

00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:50.170
discovered that when he shot
the alpha particles at the

00:25:50.170 --> 00:25:54.600
gold foil, he detected something
on his detector that

00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:59.000
click, click, click went
a little bit faster.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.460
So, what he detected was that
there were 20 alpha particles

00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:03.910
per minute.

00:26:03.910 --> 00:26:05.360
Does that sound significant?

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:08.490
It depends, right?

00:26:08.490 --> 00:26:11.140
So hopefully, the first
experiment he did, which I

00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:13.980
know that they certainly did
do was maybe it's just

00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:15.080
background noise, right?

00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:18.510
So, they took away that gold
foil and said is just the

00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:20.710
alpha particles hitting
it some other way?

00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:21.710
And no, it wasn't.

00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:24.500
When he took away the gold
foil, the count rate

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:26.990
went down to zero.

00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:31.280
If he switched from gold to
let's say iron, he also tried

00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:33.830
platinum, a number of different
foils, he found that

00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:38.780
they count rate, it still was 20
alpha particles per minute.

00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:41.970
So, this is an absolutely
outstanding discovery, even

00:26:41.970 --> 00:26:44.920
though, if we think about it,
what is the probability that

00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:46.720
this happened, how often
did this happen?

00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:48.420
It actually almost happened
not at all.

00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:51.230
We can figure out exactly what
the probability of this

00:26:51.230 --> 00:26:54.890
backscattering was just by
dividing the count rate of the

00:26:54.890 --> 00:26:57.950
number particle that were
backscattered divided by the

00:26:57.950 --> 00:27:00.170
count rate of the incident
particles.

00:27:00.170 --> 00:27:03.730
So essentially, we just
have 20, and our 20

00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:06.440
is divided by 132,000.

00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:10.266
So, we end up with a not so
large probability of 2 times

00:27:10.266 --> 00:27:14.250
10 to the negative 4.

00:27:14.250 --> 00:27:17.910
But still, we can't even
overstate how exciting this

00:27:17.910 --> 00:27:19.080
discovery was.

00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:22.440
Rutherford, the advisor here,
he had a lot of good things

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:25.150
happen in his life,
as I mentioned.

00:27:25.150 --> 00:27:28.370
He was the person responsible
for being able to first date

00:27:28.370 --> 00:27:29.600
the age of our earth.

00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:31.150
That's a pretty nice thing.

00:27:31.150 --> 00:27:34.270
He was also married, he had a
child, which I hear is very

00:27:34.270 --> 00:27:36.930
nice, very exciting, also.

00:27:36.930 --> 00:27:41.680
But yet, when he saw this one
single experiment from this

00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:46.480
undergraduate, he described this
as the most incredible

00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:50.460
event that had ever happened
to him in his life.

00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:54.150
So, this was a pretty
big deal.

00:27:54.150 --> 00:27:57.490
We won't tell his daughter.

00:27:57.490 --> 00:28:00.530
And he gave a very good analogy
in saying, "It was

00:28:00.530 --> 00:28:04.810
almost as incredible as if you'd
fired a 15 inch shell at

00:28:04.810 --> 00:28:09.440
a piece of tissue paper, and
it came back and hit you."

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:11.680
And that really illustrates
what's happening here, because

00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:17.880
if we think of the Plum
Pudding model, it's

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:21.100
essentially this very thin film,
right, there's nothing

00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:24.270
that should hit if we send alpha
particles through it.

00:28:24.270 --> 00:28:25.990
But what we actually
have is that

00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:27.880
something's bouncing back.

00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:29.910
So, what happened is Rutherford
needed to come up

00:28:29.910 --> 00:28:34.620
with a new model for the atom
with several interpretations

00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:37.870
that came out of these
experiments, and some of these

00:28:37.870 --> 00:28:41.880
interpretations were that, of
course, we now know that these

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:44.580
gold atoms, they must be mostly
empty, and the reason

00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:47.340
that we know that they must be
mostly empty is because all

00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:51.710
but 20 of these 132,000
particles

00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:53.430
went all the way through.

00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:55.270
So they weren't hitting
anything, we're dealing with

00:28:55.270 --> 00:28:57.990
mostly empty space.

00:28:57.990 --> 00:29:02.390
But he also realized that when
they did hit something, what

00:29:02.390 --> 00:29:07.110
they hit what unbelievably
massive, but also that that

00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:11.160
mass was concentrated into this
very, very small space.

00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:14.460
So eventually, this is what we
have come to call the nucleus

00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:15.970
of an atom.

00:29:15.970 --> 00:29:18.770
And the nucleus name was used
as an analogy to the nucleus

00:29:18.770 --> 00:29:22.220
of a cell, so in some ways that
makes it easier to see

00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:24.190
the connection, but I think it
can also be a little bit

00:29:24.190 --> 00:29:27.360
confusing for maybe 7th graders
that are learning both

00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:30.270
at the same time, that this
nucleus acts very different

00:29:30.270 --> 00:29:33.270
from a nucleus in a cell,
although, of course, there

00:29:33.270 --> 00:29:36.930
many of them in the
nucleus of a cell.

00:29:36.930 --> 00:29:39.510
There are some other things that
Rutherford was able to

00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:40.030
figure out.

00:29:40.030 --> 00:29:43.670
One is the diameter of the
nucleus, and that turns out to

00:29:43.670 --> 00:29:47.210
be 10 to the negative
14 meters.

00:29:47.210 --> 00:29:50.820
If we think about the size of
a typical cell -- excuse me,

00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:52.380
now I'm getting confused
about nuclei.

00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:55.970
If we think of the size of a
typical atom, we would say

00:29:55.970 --> 00:29:58.170
that would be about 10 to
the negative 10 meters.

00:29:58.170 --> 00:30:02.480
So, we can see the diameter
of a nucleus is absolutely

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:05.110
smaller, really concentrating
that mass into

00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:06.490
a very small space.

00:30:06.490 --> 00:30:08.080
So, you might be asking
how did he

00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:09.420
actually figure that out?

00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:11.150
We'll do the calculation
ourselves.

00:30:11.150 --> 00:30:14.300
In fact, we'll do the whole
experiment ourselves, minus

00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:17.290
the radioactivity in just a
minute, so we'll be able to

00:30:17.290 --> 00:30:19.120
answer that question for you.

00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:21.410
He also figured out that
the charge of the

00:30:21.410 --> 00:30:24.350
nucleus was a plus ze.

00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:28.100
This makes sense intuitively as
well, because z is just the

00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:29.240
atomic number.

00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:32.210
So, let's say we have an atomic
number of 3, that means

00:30:32.210 --> 00:30:35.670
we have 3 electrons, so we
better hope to get our neutral

00:30:35.670 --> 00:30:40.220
atom that we have a charge
of plus 3 in the nucleus.

00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:42.240
So, I mentioned at the
beginning, while he was

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:45.920
working with this radium
bromide, that I was very

00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:49.740
relieved to see that it did
not kill him to do these

00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:50.270
experiments.

00:30:50.270 --> 00:30:53.110
However, I think I will share
with you that the cause of his

00:30:53.110 --> 00:30:57.370
death was, in fact, related to
his research here, even though

00:30:57.370 --> 00:30:58.900
it was a little more
tangled up.

00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:01.630
So, what happened, of course,
after he discovered the

00:31:01.630 --> 00:31:04.670
nucleus, not surprising, he won
a Nobel Prize for this --

00:31:04.670 --> 00:31:06.300
I would hope that he would.

00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:09.510
And in addition to winning a
Nobel Prize, he was also

00:31:09.510 --> 00:31:12.200
knighted, which was a nice
bonus for someone born in

00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:14.660
England, that's a great thing
to happen to them.

00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:17.590
The problem that he ran into is
at some point a little bit

00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:20.920
later in his life, he had a
hernia which was a pretty

00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:23.620
standard case, but what he
was going to need was an

00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:24.980
operation on it.

00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:28.880
And the glitch came that at
least at the time, if you were

00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:34.320
a knight, you could only be
operated on by a doctor that

00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:36.300
was also titled.

00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:39.870
So, Rutherford had a little bit
of waiting to do for that

00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:42.940
doctor to show up, and it turns
out the wait was too

00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:45.830
long, and he actually passed
away because he discovered the

00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:48.030
nucleus and got a Noble Prize
and became knighted.

00:31:48.030 --> 00:31:51.630
So, it's still dangerous.

00:31:51.630 --> 00:31:54.560
If that opportunity comes up
for you, maybe you want to

00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:57.150
check into the policies of how
that works with the doctor

00:31:57.150 --> 00:31:58.070
situation now.

00:31:58.070 --> 00:32:01.380
Hopefully they've cleared
it up a little bit.

00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:04.820
So, what we want to do now is
see if we can understand how

00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:06.930
this backscattering
experiment worked.

00:32:06.930 --> 00:32:10.510
So, we will do our own
backscattering experiment.

00:32:10.510 --> 00:32:12.970
And we'll ask you to imagine
a few things.

00:32:12.970 --> 00:32:18.170
First is that we have this mono
layer of gold particles.

00:32:18.170 --> 00:32:23.300
So let's see if Professor
Drennan is able

00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:24.160
to help us out here.

00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:32.340
Oh, great.

00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:35.820
So, that is her daughter, Sam
that you see strapped to the

00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:45.440
chest, and Dr. Patti Christie
helping us out here.

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:45.890
All right.

00:32:45.890 --> 00:32:48.400
So, we'll move this up to the
front in just a minute, but

00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:50.920
I'm going to explain how this
experiment works, and we'll do

00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:54.360
the calculation first before
the excitement breaks out.

00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:57.480
But I'm sure you can easily see
how these styrofoam balls

00:32:57.480 --> 00:33:01.250
could, in fact, be a mono
layer of gold nuclei.

00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:07.570
We have 266, as some of you
might know who saw me counting

00:33:07.570 --> 00:33:09.700
ping-pong balls the other
day in office hours.

00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:13.680
We have 266 ping-pong balls, and
we need someone, hopefully

00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:16.160
you, to be some radioactive
material that are going to be

00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:19.110
emitting these ping-pong
balls.

00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:21.460
And when the time comes, in just
a minute, I'll ask the

00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:26.240
TAs to come down and hand these
out very quickly to you,

00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:27.800
so we can do this experiment.

00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:31.040
But first, let's go through how
we're going to determine

00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:34.210
what Rutherford determined,
which was he was interested in

00:33:34.210 --> 00:33:36.320
knowing, which we said
what the diameter

00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:38.320
of the nuclei were.

00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:40.150
So, we're going to do the same
thing and figure out the

00:33:40.150 --> 00:33:51.710
diameter of these styrofoam
balls here, and we can do it

00:33:51.710 --> 00:33:57.300
by using the relationship
of how many backscatter.

00:33:57.300 --> 00:34:00.600
So, if we think about the
probability of backscattering,

00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:04.440
which is the exact same thing
that we saw Rutherford

00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:08.670
calculate, using the 20
divided by 132,000.

00:34:08.670 --> 00:34:11.790
But in our case, the probability
of backscattering

00:34:11.790 --> 00:34:20.400
is going to be the number of
balls that backscatter, and

00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:25.740
that's going to be divided
by the total number

00:34:25.740 --> 00:34:26.990
of ping-pong balls.

00:34:26.990 --> 00:34:28.600
So, do you remember
what that was?

00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:30.180
STUDENT: 266.

00:34:30.180 --> 00:34:31.030
PROFESSOR: 266.

00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:32.510
Good information retention.

00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:33.570
All right.

00:34:33.570 --> 00:34:36.580
So, we have the probability
here.

00:34:36.580 --> 00:34:40.970
So, in terms of the number of
balls scattered over the

00:34:40.970 --> 00:34:47.770
total, we can also relate the
probability to the area of all

00:34:47.770 --> 00:34:56.440
of those nuclei divided
by the total area that

00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:59.760
the atoms take up.

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:02.710
Right, this makes a lot of
sense, because if the entire

00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:05.930
atom was made up of nuclei,
then we would have 100%

00:35:05.930 --> 00:35:09.340
probability of hitting one of
these nuclei and having things

00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:10.490
bounce back.

00:35:10.490 --> 00:35:14.020
So, here we have the area of
the nuclei we'll figure out

00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:17.260
adding those all together versus
the space of all of the

00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:18.710
atoms put together.

00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:22.600
So, not only did Professor
Sayer, who's in the Chemistry

00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:25.690
Department who put together this
contraption for all of

00:35:25.690 --> 00:35:31.220
you, not only did she magnify
the size of these gold nuclei,

00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:34.160
but she actually had to smoosh
all of these atoms closer

00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:35.740
together then they normally
would be.

00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:39.530
If, in fact, a gold nucleus was
this size here, we would

00:35:39.530 --> 00:35:42.540
need to use another lecture hall
in order to find a place

00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:45.110
to put this nucleus
right here.

00:35:45.110 --> 00:35:47.180
This is a little bit of a
tricky experiment, so we

00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:49.340
decided we'll just smoosh it all
in, and we'll actually be

00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:51.620
able to account for it, because
we'll take into

00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:56.000
account the area of all
of those atoms.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.750
I think this board does not
like to go by itself.

00:35:58.750 --> 00:35:59.780
All right.

00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:04.670
So we can figure out what that
is, the area of all of the

00:36:04.670 --> 00:36:11.550
nuclei is going to be the number
of nuclei times the

00:36:11.550 --> 00:36:16.170
area per nucleus, and we're
going to talk about the

00:36:16.170 --> 00:36:20.780
cross-section here to
keep it simple.

00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:25.110
And all of that is divided
by the area of the

00:36:25.110 --> 00:36:26.680
atoms, which is 1 .

00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:33.770
39 meters squared, measuring
that space there.

00:36:33.770 --> 00:36:37.190
So, the number of nuclei, if we
were to sit and count these

00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:41.390
as well, is 119.

00:36:41.390 --> 00:36:47.350
So, we'll multiply that by just
pi, r squared, to get

00:36:47.350 --> 00:36:50.962
that cross-section, and divide
all of that by 1 .

00:36:50.962 --> 00:36:54.310
39 meters squared.

00:36:54.310 --> 00:36:58.450
So, what we have here is a
relationship that can tell us

00:36:58.450 --> 00:37:01.520
what the probability of
backscattering is, but what we

00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:05.470
want to pull out, since we can
experimentally measure what

00:37:05.470 --> 00:37:08.250
the probability is, what we need
to pull out is the radius

00:37:08.250 --> 00:37:14.190
or the diameter of these
nuclei, so we can just,

00:37:14.190 --> 00:37:17.690
instead of solving for p, we can
switch it around and solve

00:37:17.690 --> 00:37:19.020
for the radius.

00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:21.640
So, that's going to be equal to
the probability raised to

00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:21.995
the 1/2 times 6 .

00:37:21.995 --> 00:37:28.790
098 times 10 to the
negative 2 meters.

00:37:28.790 --> 00:37:35.380
So, actually, just for
discussion sake, it makes a

00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:39.070
little more sense for us to talk
about the diameter, so

00:37:39.070 --> 00:37:41.040
that's just twice the radius.

00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:43.780
So, once we figure out what
our probability of

00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:48.010
backscattering is, we'll just
raise that to the 1/2, and

00:37:48.010 --> 00:37:50.720
we'll multiply that by 12 .

00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:54.080
20 centimeters.

00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:54.350
All right.

00:37:54.350 --> 00:37:57.580
So now all we have to do is
figure out this probability of

00:37:57.580 --> 00:37:58.760
backscattering.

00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:02.870
We know we need to divide by
266, but what we need you to

00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:06.160
help us with is to figure out
this top number here and see

00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:08.600
how many particles are
going to backscatter.

00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:13.650
So, if the TAs can come up
and quickly hand out

00:38:13.650 --> 00:38:21.520
1 particle to everyone.

00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:25.385
And a few people will need to
throw 2, if you feel like you

00:38:25.385 --> 00:38:31.360
have particularly good aim.

00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:43.390
PROFESSOR: So, as you're getting
your ping-pong balls

00:38:43.390 --> 00:38:46.960
-- do not throw them yet.

00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:48.960
Let me explain to you
what constitutes

00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:49.830
a backscatter event.

00:38:49.830 --> 00:38:54.570
So, it'll be considered a
backscatter event if your

00:38:54.570 --> 00:38:58.090
ping-pong ball hits
one of the nuclei.

00:38:58.090 --> 00:39:00.410
It's not going to be a
backscatter event if your

00:39:00.410 --> 00:39:03.800
ping-pong ball hits
the frame or these

00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:05.990
strings, or the top part.

00:39:05.990 --> 00:39:09.360
So, in a few minutes, not now,
we're going to ask you to

00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:11.960
stand up, and you can kind of
come over more toward the

00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:15.280
center of the room if you want,
and aim your ping-pong

00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:19.110
ball at the lattice here, follow
the ping-pong ball with

00:39:19.110 --> 00:39:24.220
your eye, and discover, watching
it, whether it's a

00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:27.040
backscatter -- it hits one of
the nuclei and bounces back

00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:30.570
towards you, or if it goes
through, and also if your

00:39:30.570 --> 00:39:33.920
ping-pong ball doesn't land
anywhere in the vicinity of

00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:37.190
this at all, then keep
that in mind.

00:39:37.190 --> 00:39:40.440
And then at the end of the
experiment we'll ask you what

00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:42.940
happened to your ping-pong ball,
and you'll let us know,

00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:46.520
and we can calculate the number
of backscatter events.

00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:50.880
Are there any questions
before we get started?

00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:53.030
Raise your hand if you don't
if you don't have a

00:39:53.030 --> 00:40:12.000
ping-pong ball yet.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:20.480
Any questions before
we get started?

00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:21.150
All right.

00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:23.020
So, we'll come around and
get ping-pong balls

00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:24.130
to the rest of you.

00:40:24.130 --> 00:40:27.360
Those of you who have your
ping-pong balls can now begin

00:40:27.360 --> 00:41:25.070
the experiment.

00:41:25.070 --> 00:41:25.350
[EXPERIMENTING]

00:41:25.350 --> 00:41:25.590
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:41:25.590 --> 00:41:26.850
Any last shots?

00:41:26.850 --> 00:41:36.800
There we go.

00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:37.270
All right.

00:41:37.270 --> 00:41:40.060
So, it looks like we were a
little bit successful, I saw

00:41:40.060 --> 00:41:42.730
some backbouncing.

00:41:42.730 --> 00:41:46.040
We were going to have a clicker
slide on how many

00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:48.030
bounced back, but it looks like
we're having a little

00:41:48.030 --> 00:41:49.350
technical difficulty
with that.

00:41:49.350 --> 00:41:51.750
So, what I'll ask is can you
stand up if you had your

00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:58.390
particle bounce back?

00:41:58.390 --> 00:42:01.420
All right, so let's count
how many we have here.

00:42:01.420 --> 00:42:04.860
So, 13 backscattered.

00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:24.190
TAs, if you can maybe pick up
these ping-pong balls for me.

00:42:24.190 --> 00:42:26.270
I'm sure it would be very
amusing if I fell, but I'd

00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:27.700
rather not.

00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:32.620
All right, so, we have
13 divided by 266.

00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:40.320
All right, MIT students, who
has a calculator on them?

00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:42.370
Actually, I should probably do
it as well, so I know I'm

00:42:42.370 --> 00:42:49.280
hearing correctly.

00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:51.690
So, are you getting 0 .

00:42:51.690 --> 00:42:56.710
0489 or so?

00:42:56.710 --> 00:42:57.770
All right.

00:42:57.770 --> 00:42:59.460
So, we've got our probability.

00:42:59.460 --> 00:43:02.900
We can go ahead and plug that
in, take the square root of

00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:06.840
it, multiply it by 12 .

00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:08.450
2.

00:43:08.450 --> 00:43:15.090
What are you getting
for your diameters?

00:43:15.090 --> 00:43:16.410
Yup, that's what I got, too.

00:43:16.410 --> 00:43:16.900
All right.

00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:20.670
So, we have 2 .

00:43:20.670 --> 00:43:26.140
70 for our diameter, and
that's in centimeters.

00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:28.310
So, we actually did a pretty
good job here.

00:43:28.310 --> 00:43:31.880
It turns out that the diameter
is actually 2 .

00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:33.550
5 centimeters.

00:43:33.550 --> 00:43:37.470
So, good job, experiment well
done, plus we were not exposed

00:43:37.470 --> 00:43:41.350
to radioactivity, which
is a bonus.

00:43:41.350 --> 00:43:45.460
So, this is exactly how
Rutherford did discover that

00:43:45.460 --> 00:43:52.740
these particles were present
and made this new model for

00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:56.080
the atom that we now know has
both a nucleus, and we know

00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:58.840
the size, and also
has electrons.

00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:01.910
So, to finish up today, we won't
get through all of it.

00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:04.830
But the next thing we can
actually talk about is now

00:44:04.830 --> 00:44:09.130
that we know we have an atom
that has a nucleus, let's say

00:44:09.130 --> 00:44:12.480
somewhere in the center, and
it has electrons around it,

00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:16.090
thinking on our most simple
example, which is hydrogen, we

00:44:16.090 --> 00:44:20.580
have a nucleus and an electron
that have to hang together in

00:44:20.580 --> 00:44:23.470
the atom in some way, and we
need to think about well how

00:44:23.470 --> 00:44:25.950
can we describe how atoms
behave, and specifically, how

00:44:25.950 --> 00:44:32.230
do we describe how any single
atom stays together where the

00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:34.690
two are associated, but at
the same time they don't

00:44:34.690 --> 00:44:37.070
immediately collapse
into themselves.

00:44:37.070 --> 00:44:40.930
So, what we can do is try
using the classical

00:44:40.930 --> 00:44:44.820
description of the atom and
see where this takes us.

00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:48.240
So, if we think about the force
that occurs between a

00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:52.840
positively and a negatively
charged particle, what we have

00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:56.680
is essentially a Coulomb force,
so we can describe this

00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:59.310
as a force of attraction.

00:44:59.310 --> 00:45:03.660
We can use the Coulomb force law
to explain this where we

00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:06.050
can describe the force
as a function of r.

00:45:06.050 --> 00:45:08.670
So, let's think about what
we're saying here.

00:45:08.670 --> 00:45:11.610
We're describing the force
that's holding these two

00:45:11.610 --> 00:45:16.260
particles together, and it's
related to the charge of each

00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:20.380
of the particles, where e is
the absolute value of an

00:45:20.380 --> 00:45:22.050
electron's charge.

00:45:22.050 --> 00:45:25.080
So, an electron has a charge of
negative e, we've written

00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:28.950
here, and the nucleus has
a charge of positive e.

00:45:28.950 --> 00:45:32.460
And then we have r, which is
simply the distance between

00:45:32.460 --> 00:45:33.830
the two charges.

00:45:33.830 --> 00:45:38.020
And what we see is that the
force is inversely related to

00:45:38.020 --> 00:45:41.200
the distance between
the two charges.

00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:43.910
And we can simplify this
expression as saying negative

00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:47.700
e squared over 4 pi, epsilon
nought r squared.

00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:51.580
Epsilon nought is a constant,
it's something you might see

00:45:51.580 --> 00:45:52.890
in physics as well.

00:45:52.890 --> 00:45:55.450
Essentially for our purposes
here, you can just think of it

00:45:55.450 --> 00:45:57.260
as a conversion factor.

00:45:57.260 --> 00:46:00.390
What we need to do is get rid
of the Coulomb tag that we

00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:03.470
have -- that's how we measure
our electron charges --

00:46:03.470 --> 00:46:08.780
charge, and so we use this
epsilon nought quite often,

00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:11.950
this permativity constant
of a vacuum to make that

00:46:11.950 --> 00:46:12.380
conversion.

00:46:12.380 --> 00:46:18.450
And I'll just point out here
also, this is a conversion

00:46:18.450 --> 00:46:21.120
factor you'll use quite
frequently -- many of you,

00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:24.060
quite on accident, will memorize
it as you use it over

00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:25.000
and over again.

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.080
But I do want to point out
that you don't have to

00:46:27.080 --> 00:46:29.690
memorize it for any exams in
this class, we will give you a

00:46:29.690 --> 00:46:32.920
sheet that has all the needed
constants that you're going to

00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:35.990
use on there, so save up that
brain space for other

00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:38.280
information. ah

00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:42.540
So, we can use Coulomb's force
law, and we can think about

00:46:42.540 --> 00:46:43.530
these different scenarios.

00:46:43.530 --> 00:46:46.140
So, when you come in on Monday,
we're going to start

00:46:46.140 --> 00:46:48.120
off, you can think for the
weekend -- you probably only

00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:50.610
need to think for a second about
what happens when r goes

00:46:50.610 --> 00:46:54.590
to infinity, but that's where
we'll start on Monday.

00:46:54.590 --> 00:46:58.080
And let me just suggest to all
of you also, that you get

00:46:58.080 --> 00:46:59.970
those problem sets started
this weekend.

00:46:59.970 --> 00:47:03.570
You should absolutely finish,
at least through part a this

00:47:03.570 --> 00:47:06.220
weekend, and save part
b for next week.

00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:08.860
So, have a great weekend.
