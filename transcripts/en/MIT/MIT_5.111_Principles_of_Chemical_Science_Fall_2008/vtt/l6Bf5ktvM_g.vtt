00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:21.270
PROFESSOR: --

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.750
10 seconds to answer the
first clicker question.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.590
As you can see we're having
another competition today, so

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.680
see if you can beat out Justin's
recitation and get

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.130
the most correct today.

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:38.310
So, this is a topic from Friday,
which is asking us

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:39.900
which of the following
molecules are

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.490
free radical species.

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.840
OK.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.460
So it looks like most and you
got it, that it's o h.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.560
Let's quickly go over why that
is just in case you weren't

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.110
one of that 74%.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.640
So, if we're looking at o h
versus c o, what are we

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.890
looking at to decide if we
have a radical here?

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.180
Valence electrons.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.130
So we have 6 plus 1 in terms
of o h, that's 7, versus

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.020
having 4 plus 6, which is 10.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.800
Specifically, what
do we look for in

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:12.740
terms of valence electrons?

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.930
Odd numbers.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:20.440
So, we have a radical here with
o h, whereas we have an

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.280
even number of valence electrons
for c o, so that's

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.110
not a radical, in terms of
what we know how to think

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.920
about so far, which is using
our Lewis structures to

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:29.990
determine that.

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.390
All right.

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.600
So that's a little review from
Friday, let's move on to

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.570
today's lecture.

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.390
In terms of what we're going
to be talking about today,

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.650
we're going to finish up with
talking about polar covalent

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.480
bonds, and finish up
with discussing the

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.880
idea of polar molecules.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.370
And then we'll move on to start
talking about well, we

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.140
know how to draw our Lewis
structures, how can we use

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.800
those Lewis structures to think
about the actual shapes

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.950
of molecules.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.130
So, first thinking about our
polar covalent bonds.

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.240
What we had established is if we
have a case where we have a

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.440
covalent bond, but there's
unequal sharing of electrons

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.890
between the two atoms, namely
because they have different

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.660
electronegativities, what we see
is we have a polar bond or

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.640
a polar covalent bond where one
of the atoms is going to

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.420
pull away more of the electron
density from that bond, giving

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.420
it that partial negative charge
where the other atom is

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.670
going to end up with a partial
positive charge.

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.050
In terms of thinking about
well, what do we call a

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.640
covalent bond versus a polar
covalent bond versus a purely

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.870
ionic bond, it turns out that
the distinction is a little

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.920
bit fuzzy, it's not a clear
line, but in terms of talking

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.760
about things in general, and
especially in thinking about

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.670
problems for this course, what
we're going to say is if you

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.380
have an electronegativity or chi
difference between the two

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.350
atoms that is greater than 0 .

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.430
4, and less than 1 .

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.710
7, and we're talking about the
Pauling electronegativity

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:01.280
scale here, which is what's
used throughout your book.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.010
If you have a difference in
electronegativity anywhere in

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.030
that range, we'll have what we
call a polar covalent bond

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.650
between those two atoms.

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.900
So, for example, if we compare
the chi values for hydrogen

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.190
versus carbon, we see
they only have a

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.990
difference of 0.4 .

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:19.730
0.4 is not greater than 0.4 .

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.910
So we would not call this a c h
bond, we would not say it's

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.080
polar covalent, we would
just call it covalent.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.490
In contrast, if we talk about
a carbon oxygen bond, now we

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:34.680
have a chi difference of 0.8 ,
so that is greater than 0.4 ,

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.880
so we'll call carbon oxygen
bond polar covalent.

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.870
We can extend this idea of
talking about these polar

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.330
covalent bonds to thinking
about an entire molecule.

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.080
I'm sure you've all heard of
the term a polar molecule

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.150
versus a non-polar molecule, and
essentially, when we talk

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.450
about having a polar molecule,
what we're saying is that

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.030
there's is a net non-zero
dipole moment

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.720
within the whole molecule.

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.200
So essentially, what we have
to do is combine all of the

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.320
individual bonds to think about
the molecule as a whole.

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:10.530
So, let's take an example of
carbon dioxide here, or c o 2.

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.130
Very soon in the lecture you'll
learn how to predict

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.160
shapes based on Lewis
structures.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.560
So you will quickly see that
this is a linear molecule.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.610
We can think about the
2 bonds within it.

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:25.260
There's two carbon oxygen bonds,
and we know that there

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.600
is a dipole in that
bond, which is

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.550
going toward the oxygen.

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.830
Remember, in chemistry we always
draw the arrow, we're

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.000
always interested in what those
electrons are doing.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.560
So if we draw in the bond
dipoles, and you can draw

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.980
these into your notes, you want
to draw an arrow towards

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:42.750
the oxygen in each case.

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.220
But we're not just interested
here in thinking about do we

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.430
have a polar bond, we actually
want to know in general do we

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:49.540
have a polar molecule.

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.100
So, looking at c o 2 as a whole,
do you think we have a

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:56.330
polar or a non-polar
molecule here?

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.530
Non-polar.

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.700
OK, very good for all of you
that said non-polar.

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.340
The reason it's non-polar is
we simply have two equal

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.870
vectors in opposite directions,
so they cancel

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:05.810
each other out.

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.640
The net effect is that
we have a 0 dipole

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:13.360
moment in the c o molecule.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.180
In contrast, we can
look at h 2 o.

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.570
H 2 o actually has this bent
shape, and again, we'll see

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:22.860
very soon and how to predict
that h 2 o has a bent shape,

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.300
that water is bent.

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.490
And again, we do have dipole
moments -- we have bonds where

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.310
there is a polar bond and we
should point our arrow toward

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:34.200
the oxygen, because electron
density is being pulled from

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.220
the hydrogen atoms
to the oxygen.

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:40.730
And again, we can cancel some
of these vectors out, but we

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:45.200
still have a net dipole moment
that is going to be going up

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.660
if we think about combining
these 2 vectors here.

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:52.390
So, what we would say, which
is what we know from

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:54.910
everything we've always
heard, which is that

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:57.040
water is a polar molecule.

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.780
So, this is a great
way to think about

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:00.280
molecules in general.

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:05.290
It's very easy to think about
if those vectors cancel each

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:07.870
other out or if they're additive
when we're talking

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:13.810
about just single bonds, so we
have two atoms or if we have

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:17.180
just three atoms, as we do
in these cases here.

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:19.955
But it turns out, a lot of the
molecules we consider are

00:06:19.955 --> 00:06:21.960
actually much, much,
much larger than

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.690
just a couple of atoms.

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:27.360
So we can't often think about
canceling all the different

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.550
vectors out.

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:30.720
And in general, when we're
talking about these really

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.820
large molecules, whether
they're large organic

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:35.950
molecules or we're talking about
proteins, which can have

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:39.130
thousands of atoms in them,
instead of adding up all those

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:42.690
individual polar bonds, what
we do is we talk about the

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:45.610
number of polar groups that it
will have in the molecule.

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:48.120
So we can think about a protein,
for example, as

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:51.160
having a lot of different polar
groups or one that has

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.410
not too many polar
side groups.

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:56.330
That's one way you hear people
talking about proteins, and

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:59.650
that has a lot to do with their
solubility in water, and

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:02.030
also about how the protein's
going to fold.

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:04.970
But let's look at a little bit
about less complicated example

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:07.440
than a protein with thousands
of different atoms.

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:10.130
Let's instead consider a couple
of vitamins here, which

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:13.090
instead have a few dozen
different atoms in them.

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:17.990
Specifically, let's look at
vitamin A and vitamin B9.

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:26.940
Does anyone know another
name for vitamin B9?

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:30.710
I don't think I hear it -- does
anyone say folic acid.

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:34.220
It's also sometimes called
vitamin M. It's one of the

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:36.860
vitamin B9 vitamins, there's
actually other forms of

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:39.900
vitamin B9, but this is
one of the big ones

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:41.170
that you hear about.

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:43.680
Hopefully you're all very
familiar with folic acid,

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:46.280
because it's an important
vitamin to take, especially if

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:48.530
you're a woman, especially if
there's any chance you ever

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:52.050
might become pregnant in any
kind of near future time, by

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:56.070
accident or on purpose.

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:59.920
And the reason for this is
because folic acid deficiency

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:03.480
in pregnant women leads to
neural tube defects in babies,

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:07.960
and your brain develops very,
very, very early in pregnancy,

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:10.580
the brain of an embryo.

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:13.100
So it turns out that a lot of
women don't realize they're

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:16.870
pregnant while the fetus' brain
is developing, and if

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:19.090
these women are not getting
enough folic acid, you can end

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:21.900
up with spina bifida, which is
an absolutely devastating and

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:25.870
very preventable disease or
other neural tube defects.

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:27.990
So hopefully, if you're not
familiar with folic acid,

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:31.210
you'll become familiar at least
within the next 10 or 15

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:33.990
years or so before you're
thinking about maybe, on

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:36.560
purpose, becoming pregnant
at some time.

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:39.440
Vitamin A you probably all
heard about growing up,

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:41.700
getting enough of your carrots
so you can see at night.

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:44.670
Vitamin A is important
for eye health.

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:46.660
But just looking at the
structure of these two

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:49.390
molecules, knowing what we
know so far about general

00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:52.210
chemistry, we can already say
a lot about how these are

00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:53.910
going to function the body
or how they'll be

00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:55.170
treated in the body.

00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:58.310
And specifically, let's take a
look at which of these two

00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:01.580
molecules has more polar bonds
and see what that tells us.

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:05.580
So take a look at your two
structures and tell me which

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:10.130
has, between folic acid and
vitamin A, more polar groups

00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:19.570
within the vitamin.

00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:21.910
And this should go pretty
quickly since you don't need

00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:24.800
to have an exact number, we're
just looking and glancing and

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:25.730
seeing which has more.

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:39.300
So let's take 10 seconds
on this.

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:39.780
All right, great.

00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:43.260
So most you said folic acid or
vitamin B9, so let's switch

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.630
back to our notes and
take a look at why.

00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:49.290
So vitamin B9 has more
polar bonds.

00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:52.100
It's very easy to see, once I
highlight, that it's not even

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:53.520
a close call at all.

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:57.150
We have a bunch of different
polar bonds in B9 versus just

00:09:57.150 --> 00:10:01.300
one in vitamin A. Remember, the
c h bond we're not calling

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:04.080
polar covalent because it only
has an electronegativity

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:07.820
difference of 0.4 between
the two atoms.

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:11.100
So what we know is that vitamin
B9, folic acid, is

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:12.600
more polar.

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:16.370
Remember, we also just said that
water is polar, so would

00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:20.700
we say that B9 is water
or fat soluble?

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:23.760
It's going to be water soluble
-- everyone knows the saying,

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:25.980
"like dissolves like."
B9 is going to

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:27.810
be very water soluble.

00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:30.240
This actually is very important
if you think about

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:31.250
taking your vitamins.

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:34.220
This means if it's water
soluble, any vitamins that are

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:35.970
water soluble, and now you
should to be able to look at

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:38.780
the structure of any vitamin and
tell me, for example, that

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:41.510
vitamin C is water soluble,
that folic

00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:42.760
acid is water soluble.

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:45.090
If you take these vitamins, what
happens is that they're

00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:48.340
very quickly and easily excreted
into your urine.

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:51.040
So, for example, some people
like to take mega doses of

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:54.360
vitamin C. What really happens
is that you have a mega dose

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:56.570
of vitamin C in your urine,
it doesn't stick around

00:10:56.570 --> 00:10:57.960
long in your body.

00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:00.210
So it doesn't help and
just take all of your

00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:01.550
vitamin C at once.

00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:03.990
That's why it's important to eat
balanced meals throughout

00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:06.960
the day, you need to be getting
a constant supply of

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:08.510
these water soluble vitamins.

00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:11.000
The same is for folic acid, you
can't just take it once a

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.950
month, you need to be taking it
regularly in order that you

00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:16.800
keep the stores up in your body,
otherwise you're going

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:19.480
to excrete it, you're going to
get rid of it very quickly.

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:22.490
In contrast, if we think about
vitamin A, is this going to be

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:25.550
water soluble or fat soluble?

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:27.900
Yup, so this is the fat
soluble vitamin.

00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:31.440
Vitamin E is another big one
that's fat soluble that gets a

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:36.890
lot of press in terms of being
an important vitamin to take.

00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:39.570
We can think about what it means
when a vitamin is fat

00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:41.470
soluble instead of
water soluble.

00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:43.860
Well, now it's not going to get
excreted out of our body

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:47.020
so quickly, so we actually can
build up amounts of vitamin A

00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:50.640
vitamin E, for example, but that
can also pose a problem

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:53.580
if you think about biologically
what's happening.

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:56.110
And up here I just show two
different supplements that I

00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:57.020
found on the internet.

00:11:57.020 --> 00:12:00.950
This is One A Day vitamin, it
has about 100% of what you

00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:02.220
need of everything.

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:05.340
And then this vitamin is one
that I found that's supposed

00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:07.790
to really help you with your
eye health, if you have bad

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:10.880
vision instead of glasses, they
suggest that you try this

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:12.060
vitamin here.

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:15.420
And what you can see is that it
has five times your daily

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:19.870
value of vitamin A, and 13 times
what you need of vitamin

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:22.870
E. Is this a good idea?

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:23.580
No.

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:26.670
Basically, you are just building
up more and more and

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:29.890
more of these fat soluble
vitamins into your body.

00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:32.070
And there have been studies that
have come out recently

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:34.920
trying to look at the health
benefits of vitamin E, and in

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:37.320
some of these studies they give
these mega doses, and

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:40.120
instead what they find is
increased bleeding in these

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:43.420
patients, an increase in overall
different types of

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:45.530
death that can be happening.

00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:48.150
You want to take your vitamins,
it's very important,

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:49.900
but you don't want it just
build up, and you want to

00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:52.830
think about is the vitamin that
I'm going and getting 800

00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:56.610
times what I need a day, is that
a water soluble vitamin

00:12:56.610 --> 00:12:59.145
or a fat soluble vitamin, and
using your chemistry, you

00:12:59.145 --> 00:13:01.310
should be able to very quickly
take a quick look at that

00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:04.540
structure and figure out what
kind of a vitamin that is.

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:05.200
All right.

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:08.190
So that's just one reason we
would want to be able to think

00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:10.920
about polarity is thinking about
whether something is

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:13.790
very water soluble or not.

00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:16.740
Let's think about some other
things that have to do with

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:19.390
polarity and then can tell us
a lot of other information.

00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:22.670
So let's move on to talking
about the shapes of molecules.

00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:26.350
And the shapes of molecules is
very important for a number of

00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:28.810
different properties when we're
thinking about chemical

00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:32.010
reactions and reactions that
take place in the body.

00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:35.090
When we talk about shapes of
molecules, we're talking about

00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:37.690
the geometry of that molecule.

00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:40.450
And the geometry influences
all of its different

00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:43.970
properties, including things
like melting point or boiling

00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:45.580
point, it's reactivity.

00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:48.640
We just saw when talking about
polar molecules, that it

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:51.380
influences whether or
not the molecule

00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:54.440
itself is polar or apolar.

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:57.580
It's also really important when
we talk about biology.

00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:00.020
Shape is particularly important
when you think about

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:04.380
enzymes having an active site
where a molecule needs to fit

00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:06.875
perfectly into the active
site, it does that

00:14:06.875 --> 00:14:08.180
because of its shape.

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:11.190
A quick example that we can
think about is with sucrose.

00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:14.610
Does anyone know what
sucrose is?

00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:17.780
It's just table sugar -- sucrose
is that crystal in

00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:22.870
sugar that we hopefully use in
most of our sugar intake as

00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:23.290
sweeteners.

00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:26.660
A lot of times we use corn
syrup, which is often not

00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:30.350
sucrose and which tends to be
not always as good for us,

00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:32.900
although anything in too much
excess is obviously a

00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:34.020
non-ideal situation.

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:37.910
But in order for us to use the
energy from sucrose, sucrose

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:40.450
is made up of two individual
sugar monomers.

00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:42.620
It's made up of a monomer of
glucose and one of fructose, a

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:46.890
6 and a 5 membered ring, so in
order for our body to use it,

00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:49.010
we need to break it into
with its monomers.

00:14:49.010 --> 00:14:51.800
And if we that, we can do it by
what's called hydrolysis --

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:54.770
sucrose and water breaks down
into its two monomers, now our

00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:56.060
body can use it.

00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:58.940
The problem is this process
takes on the order of 10 or

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:02.460
maybe 100 years in order for us
to get enough of the sugar

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:03.520
broken down.

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:06.410
That's why we need an enzyme
molecule, and the enzyme in

00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:08.200
our body is called sucrase.

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:12.340
Sucrase breaks down sucrose, it
catalyzes that reaction, so

00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:13.720
it happens very quickly.

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:17.460
And the key is, and here's a
ball and stick shape of what

00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:18.470
sucrose looks like.

00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:21.550
It needs to fit exactly
into that active site.

00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:24.750
When it does, it combines into
the enzyme, the enzyme can

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:29.470
then catalyze the hydrolysis or
the breaking apart of those

00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:32.800
two individual monomers into
its separate pieces.

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:36.160
And then it let's go of the
glucose and the fructose, and

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:39.050
we get our enzyme back again,
and something else combined

00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:40.690
into that active site.

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:44.180
So, this is one very simple
example of why molecular shape

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:45.190
is very important.

00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:48.100
A lot of times you're thinking
about small molecules

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:50.410
interacting with proteins or
interacting with other

00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:52.580
molecules, and you want to think
about the shape of that

00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:55.590
molecule to think about how that
interaction is going to

00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:57.740
take place.

00:15:57.740 --> 00:16:01.240
So what we're going to use to
think about molecular shape or

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:05.680
molecular geometry is what's
called valence shell electron

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:08.040
repulsion or vsper theory.

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:10.410
And this theory is very
convenient for us to be

00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:13.410
thinking about because we are
now masters of drawing Lewis

00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:16.680
structures, and vesper theory is
based on Lewis structures,

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:20.450
and also the principle that when
we have valence electron

00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:22.950
pairs, they're going to
repel each other.

00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:26.220
This make sense any time you
have negatively-charged

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:28.720
electrons, you want to get them
as far away from each

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:29.960
other as possible
because they're

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:32.730
all negatively charged.

00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:35.600
And the other principle is that
the geometry around that

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:38.260
central atom, which you've
identified as the central atom

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.690
in the Lewis structure, is
going to be such that it

00:16:40.690 --> 00:16:44.550
minimizes the repulsion between
those either bonding

00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:48.530
electrons or the
electron pairs.

00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:50.810
So when we talk about vsper
there's a special nomenclature

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:57.420
that we do use, and in vsper we
have a -- does anyone know

00:16:57.420 --> 00:16:59.410
what a means in vsper theory?

00:16:59.410 --> 00:17:04.320
It's a central atom.

00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:09.030
What about x?

00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:11.790
So this is actually the
bonding, any bonding

00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:13.320
atom you call x.

00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:18.530
And then we have e, which
is equal to lone pairs.

00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:21.840
So e is a lone pair -- e is not
a lone pair electron, so

00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:28.100
if you have two electrons,
that's one lone pair.

00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:28.400
All right.

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:30.750
So there are some guidelines
that we use when we're coming

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:32.350
up with these vsper
geometries.

00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:35.490
The first thing we talk about is
the steric number, which we

00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:37.880
use to predict what that
geometry will be.

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:40.400
When we're talking about steric
number, all we're

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:44.340
talking about is adding together
the number we have of

00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:47.590
bonded atoms, plus the
number of lone pairs.

00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:50.580
So, essentially were just adding
x to e and that gives

00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:52.440
us our steric number.

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:56.540
So, for example, if we look at
this molecule, which is a x 2

00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:59.820
e, what is the steric
number here?

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:03.400
Yeah, it's 3, so we have
a steric number of 3.

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:05.950
Something that I want to point
out is that we could have a

00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:10.850
different molecule, which is
also a x 2 e, but in this case

00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:14.490
we have a double bond between
the central atom and one of

00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:17.950
the x atoms here, and what I
want to point out is in vsper

00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:21.680
theory we treat bonds as bonds,
we don't worry about if

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:23.440
they're single or they're double
or they're triple.

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:27.710
So again, we call this a x 2
e, this again, has a steric

00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:28.960
number of 3.

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:32.820
So what's important in terms of
vsper theory is the number

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:35.620
of atoms bonded to
a central atom.

00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:38.560
What's not important is the
types of bonds that we're

00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:41.830
dealing with.

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:44.950
A few other guidelines I want to
mention is first of all, to

00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:46.760
think about resonance
structures.

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:49.350
So on Friday we were talking
about the chromate anion, and

00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:52.870
we said that here are two of its
resonance structures here,

00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:55.030
but that we could actually
draw four more resonance

00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:59.320
structures, and I just want to
point out when you take a

00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:01.860
molecule that has many different
resonance structures

00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:05.730
and you want to draw its vsper,
it's Lewis structure

00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:09.940
and its vsper geometry, you
can take any single one of

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:12.340
those resonance structures, it
doesn't matter, you'll all end

00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:14.990
up with the same geometry.

00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:17.610
And lastly, if we're talking
about a molecule that has more

00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:20.420
than one central atom, which is
what we're very, very often

00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:22.810
doing, you need to deal with
each one separately.

00:19:22.810 --> 00:19:27.480
So for example, with methanol
here, we have a carbon, which

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:30.290
is a central atom, and we also
have an oxygen, which is a

00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:33.880
central atom, you need to talk
about the geometry separately,

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:35.330
we don't talk about
the geometry

00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:38.840
of the entire molecule.

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:41.740
So, let's go ahead and look at
some of these vsper examples,

00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:45.110
and Professor Drennan is going
to help demonstrate what some

00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:48.350
of these are with some
models here.

00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:50.870
So the first case we're going
to talk about is without any

00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:53.830
lone pairs -- this is the most
straightforward case.

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:58.070
And our first case that we can
have is a x 3, which is going

00:19:58.070 --> 00:20:02.170
to have a linear shape, and that
will have a bond angle of

00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:07.080
a 180 degrees.

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:09.190
The next case that we can
talk about is trigonal

00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:11.740
planar or a x 3.

00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:14.090
Now, you do need to know
these geometry, you

00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:15.130
need to know the names.

00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:16.880
A lot of them are very
easy to remember.

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:20.590
I expect not too many of you
will get linear incorrect.

00:20:20.590 --> 00:20:22.670
Also, trigonal planar,
pretty easy.

00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:26.140
Trigonal, it has 3 atoms around
the central atom and

00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:27.240
the molecule is planar.

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:34.850
PROFESSOR: So, what is the bond
angle for this geometry?

00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:35.340
120.

00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:36.540
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:36.830
Great.

00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:41.700
So, next we can think about a x
4, and this is what's called

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:43.510
a tetrahedral geometry.

00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:45.870
If you're trying to remember
this name you can think of

00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:48.600
each of those bonding atoms
as being in the corner of

00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:49.930
tetrahedron.

00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:53.230
One thing I want to point out is
you're seeing some notation

00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:56.250
we haven't used before in this
class where you have a wedge

00:20:56.250 --> 00:20:58.965
coming out at you, and you also
have a dashed line to one

00:20:58.965 --> 00:21:00.150
of those bonds.

00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:03.350
Any time you see a wedge in a
Lewis structure, it means that

00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:05.280
it's coming out at you -- it's
either coming out of the

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:07.620
screen or it's coming
out of your paper.

00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:10.670
And any time you see a dashed
line here, which might be

00:21:10.670 --> 00:21:13.725
easier to see in your notes,
that means that the bond is

00:21:13.725 --> 00:21:17.190
actually going into the page or
into the screen or into the

00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:17.470
blackboard.

00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:24.140
PROFESSOR: And what are the
angles for a tetrahedral?

00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:26.310
PROFESSOR: All right,
so they're 1 0 9 .

00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:26.550
5.

00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:27.320
Pretty close.

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:30.420
So that's as far away as those
bonds can get from each other

00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:31.730
would be 109 .

00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:33.910
5 degrees.

00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:37.600
The next case we
have is a x 5.

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:40.560
That is what we call trigonal
bipyramidal.

00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:43.850
Again, we have trigonal, because
we have those 3 bonds

00:21:43.850 --> 00:21:47.700
in the center, and if you can
picture putting walls between

00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:50.360
all those bonds, you can see
there's a pyramid on the top

00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:52.300
and a pyramid on the bottom,
so bipyramidal.

00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:55.820
PROFESSOR: And there are 2 sets
of angles here, what are

00:21:55.820 --> 00:22:00.380
the angles for equatorial
atoms?

00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:01.230
120.

00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:02.220
And then for axial?

00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:02.650
90.

00:22:02.650 --> 00:22:07.770
PROFESSOR: And again, axial,
those are just the ones in the

00:22:07.770 --> 00:22:09.740
axis, and equatorial
if you put your

00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:12.360
globe around the equator.

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:15.960
So the last case we
have is a x 6.

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:21.740
A x 6 is what we call octahedral
-- you can picture

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:24.510
each of those bonded atoms as
a corner of an octahedron.

00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:27.920
PROFESSOR: And what are
the angles in this,

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:28.810
this one set of angles?

00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:30.370
90.

00:22:30.370 --> 00:22:30.790
PROFESSOR: Great.

00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:32.290
So, 90 degrees.

00:22:32.290 --> 00:22:34.090
All right.

00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:37.110
So this is all straightforward
when we're just thinking about

00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:39.720
different molecular shapes that
don't have any lone pairs

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:42.600
in them, but once we start
having lone pairs, we now need

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:44.570
to think about how those
lone pairs are going

00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:47.180
to affect the geometry.

00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:50.980
But before we do that, let's
talk about some examples of

00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:52.920
molecules without lone pairs.

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:56.340
So the first case is what we saw
at the beginning of class,

00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:59.990
carbon dioxide, and we said that
that was linear, and now

00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:05.250
we know why it's linear -- it
has a formula of a x 2, and an

00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:07.410
s n number of 2.

00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:13.250
And that's a bond angle
of 180 degrees.

00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:17.850
So, you can tell us about
borane, borane is a x 3.

00:23:17.850 --> 00:23:20.420
PROFESSOR: And what
is the geometry?

00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:23.910
And the angle?

00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:25.910
120.

00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:29.600
Feel free to yell out very
loudly, we want people in

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:34.184
OpenCourseWare to hear the
answers coming from the room.

00:23:34.184 --> 00:23:34.810
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:23:34.810 --> 00:23:37.960
So the next case we're going
to look at is c h 4 or

00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:40.690
methane, and let's do a clicker
question here to make

00:23:40.690 --> 00:23:43.980
sure everyone is remembering
these geometries.

00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:46.640
And this should be very quick,
and try to not turn the page

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:49.380
back one, and tell us in
10 seconds here what

00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:50.510
the geometry is.

00:23:50.510 --> 00:24:06.480
98%, that is a new record.

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:07.410
Very good.

00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:07.620
Tetrahedral.

00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:12.420
PROFESSOR: All right, while I'm
holding carbon dioxide in

00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:15.540
one hand and methane in the
other hand, I just want to do

00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:18.910
an additional plug for the
energy debate tonight.

00:24:18.910 --> 00:24:21.980
So there will be representatives
from both

00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:24.660
presidential campaigns that
are going to be there to

00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:25.670
answer questions.

00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:28.870
And I'm not sure of the exact
format, I'm not sure whether

00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:31.490
all audience members are
going to be able to ask

00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:33.310
questions or not.

00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:35.000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be
there, I'm supposed to be

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.890
giving a talk actually,
ironically, about energy at

00:24:38.890 --> 00:24:40.770
the same time.

00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:43.610
But if I can't make it and
you're allowed to ask

00:24:43.610 --> 00:24:46.560
questions, I'd like you to
ask a question for me.

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:50.530
So, my lab looks at enzymes that
remove carbon monoxide

00:24:50.530 --> 00:24:52.400
and carbon dioxide from
the environment.

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:55.320
And I have an energy initiative
grant to do this,

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:58.750
because MIT recognizes that an
important part of any energy

00:24:58.750 --> 00:25:01.910
initiative is thinking about
lowering pollutants and

00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:03.630
greenhouse gases.

00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:07.040
So, I heard on Thursday at the
debate when Governor Sarah

00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:10.140
Palin was asked directly if
she really doesn't think

00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:12.570
there's any connection between
global warming and any

00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:15.850
man-made activities, that she
said, well, you know, it could

00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:19.690
be just regular temperature
fluctuations, and she doesn't

00:25:19.690 --> 00:25:21.820
want to point any fingers.

00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:23.520
So, she's not quite sure.

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:26.760
I also learned on Thursday that
she will head the energy

00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:30.530
initiative in a McCain/Palin
White House.

00:25:30.530 --> 00:25:34.180
So, if you go to this debate,
I would like you to ask what

00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:37.890
is your plan for sequestering
carbon dioxide and other

00:25:37.890 --> 00:25:39.310
greenhouse gases.

00:25:39.310 --> 00:25:41.840
You can ask both candidates,
and please let me know what

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:44.400
the answer is, because I think
that's a really important

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:46.600
question -- here we have carbon
dioxide, here we have

00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:48.200
methane, we need to be thinking

00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:50.930
about greenhouse gases.

00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:52.810
PROFESSOR: You can also throw
in the question that you do

00:25:52.810 --> 00:25:54.170
know this is tetrahedral
and 109 .

00:25:54.170 --> 00:26:00.760
5 degrees -- show your chemistry
knowledge here.

00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:02.990
All right, and let's keep
showing that we know our

00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:08.300
geometries, let's
look at p c l 5.

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:12.240
PROFESSOR: And what
is geometry here?

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:12.820
Yup.

00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:15.960
And the angles?

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:18.700
120 and 90.

00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:22.520
PROFESSOR: So, 120 equatorial,
and 90 axial.

00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:28.450
And last we have s f 6.

00:26:28.450 --> 00:26:29.990
PROFESSOR: So, what is
the geometry here?

00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:31.040
Octahedral.

00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:31.370
And angle?

00:26:31.370 --> 00:26:31.550
90.

00:26:31.550 --> 00:26:37.270
PROFESSOR: All right, so there's
our set of examples,

00:26:37.270 --> 00:26:41.020
one for each for those shapes
or geometries that have no

00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:42.240
lone pairs.

00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:44.600
And now let's think a little
bit about once we do have

00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:46.820
molecules with lone pairs.

00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:49.840
And the biggest point to keep
in mind when we're comparing

00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:53.580
lone pair electrons with bonding
electrons or electrons

00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:56.850
in bonds, is that when you have
electrons in bonds they

00:26:56.850 --> 00:27:00.060
have less spatial distribution
than lone pairs.

00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:03.340
So that's just a way of saying
that electrons and bonds, they

00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:05.930
take up less space.

00:27:05.930 --> 00:27:09.060
So, when we think about lone
pair electrons, they're taking

00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:11.830
up more space and this means
that they're going to

00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:15.660
experience more repulsion in
thinking about the lone pair

00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:19.220
electrons with either other lone
pair electrons or with

00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:20.310
bonding electrons.

00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:22.400
So let's think a second
about the order that

00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:23.520
this will be in.

00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:26.240
The biggest repulsion we would
feel is if we have two

00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:29.640
different lone pair electrons
or lone pairs.

00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:31.660
They're going to have
the most repulsion.

00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:34.700
In the middle is if we're
talking about a lone pair with

00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:36.050
a bonding pair.

00:27:36.050 --> 00:27:38.640
And then the least repulsion
is going to be between two

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:43.870
bonds or two bonding
pairs of electrons.

00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:46.650
So, let's look at an example
of where this comes up.

00:27:46.650 --> 00:27:49.780
So the first example I'm going
to talk about is a molecule

00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:53.810
that has the geometry of a
seesaw shape, and once we get

00:27:53.810 --> 00:27:56.160
to having Professor Drennan
actually show you that shape,

00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:57.480
you will never forget.

00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:59.240
See-saw, that's going to
be one of the easy

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:00.790
geometries to remember.

00:28:00.790 --> 00:28:03.350
But the first thing that we need
to consider in terms of

00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:08.380
the shape, which starts, if you
picture first of all, and

00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:11.380
these models sometimes don't
quite stay together, we could

00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:13.400
actually have two different
possibilities.

00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:16.790
The first is the idea that we
could have an axial lone pair,

00:28:16.790 --> 00:28:19.520
and the second is the
possibility that we could have

00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:21.370
an equatorial lone pair.

00:28:21.370 --> 00:28:23.980
And we could consider both, and
we should be able to use

00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:26.710
our vsper principles to think
about which one is actually

00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:27.860
going to happen.

00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:31.710
So if we think about having an
axial lone pair here, that

00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:34.210
would mean that these lone pair
electrons are going to be

00:28:34.210 --> 00:28:38.030
within 90 degrees of three
different loan pairs, and

00:28:38.030 --> 00:28:40.693
actually we'll see later, it
will be more than 90 because

00:28:40.693 --> 00:28:42.220
they're actually going
to push them down.

00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:44.990
But in terms of considering
how many bonding electron

00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:49.090
pairs they'll repel strongly,
what we care about is anything

00:28:49.090 --> 00:28:51.040
within 90 degrees initially.

00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:53.850
So, what we would see with the
axial lone pair is that we

00:28:53.850 --> 00:28:56.460
have three lone pairs
that we're going to

00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:59.040
very strongly repel.

00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:01.940
Now would you tell me, if we
think about an equatorial lone

00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:07.120
pair, how many different bonding
electrons or a bonding

00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:10.570
pairs that will strongly
repel if we have an

00:29:10.570 --> 00:29:11.750
equatorial lone pair?

00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:15.280
So you might need to look at
your notes to actually compare

00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:31.040
these two before you submit
your answer up here.

00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:31.270
All right.

00:29:31.270 --> 00:29:45.010
Let's take 10 seconds on that.

00:29:45.010 --> 00:29:47.540
OK, strong showing with the
clicker questions today.

00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:51.450
It's going to be a tight race
for clicker competition.

00:29:51.450 --> 00:29:53.730
It's correct that the equatorial
is, in fact, has

00:29:53.730 --> 00:29:58.330
two, only two that it
strongly repels.

00:29:58.330 --> 00:30:00.860
So, actually it's probably
easier to look at Professor

00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:02.920
Drennan's model here
to see that.

00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:06.980
So it's where the equatorial
lone pair is that is the

00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:10.320
actual seesaw geometry.

00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:13.610
PROFESSOR: So, how many of you
had seesaws in playgrounds

00:30:13.610 --> 00:30:15.650
when you were growing up?

00:30:15.650 --> 00:30:16.290
Oh, a lot of people.

00:30:16.290 --> 00:30:18.300
I know that they're not
considered totally safe

00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:20.800
anymore, so some of them
are going away.

00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:25.120
So this is seesaw.

00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:32.660
Now you should never
forget it.

00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:35.100
PROFESSOR: All right, so seesaw,
we've got seesaw.

00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:38.470
Just to point out a
few more shapes.

00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:42.750
We took one out, we replaced one
bond with a lone pair in

00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:43.190
terms of seesaw.

00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:46.650
If we have a x 3 e
2 now we have two

00:30:46.650 --> 00:30:49.190
equatorial lone pairs.

00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:50.210
This is called the T-shaped

00:30:50.210 --> 00:30:51.220
PROFESSOR: T-shaped.

00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:55.290
PROFESSOR: See, these aren't
too hard to remember the

00:30:55.290 --> 00:30:58.160
geometries, the geometry
names.

00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:02.920
And we also can think about
if we have a x 4 e 2.

00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:06.030
So now in order to get our lone
pairs as far away from

00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:08.340
each other as possible, they're
going to be on the

00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:15.760
axial position, and this is
called square planer.

00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:18.190
PROFESSOR: So, this is easy to
remember, square, also planar.

00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:22.530
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:31:22.530 --> 00:31:24.900
So, let's talk a little bit
now about what the actual

00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:27.950
angles are between bonds
when now we have

00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:29.710
these lone pairs present.

00:31:29.710 --> 00:31:33.540
And remember, what we said is
when we have a lone pair of

00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:36.390
electrons, they actually are
going to have more repulsion

00:31:36.390 --> 00:31:40.160
than if we just have
a c h bond or a

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:41.990
bonded pair of a electrons.

00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:46.230
So essentially what that means
is that in molecules that have

00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:49.195
lone pair electrons, so for
example, if we look at n h 3

00:31:49.195 --> 00:31:53.580
or ammonia versus methane here,
and Professor Drennan is

00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:55.900
showing those models
to you here.

00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:59.570
What you end up seeing is
actually that the bonding

00:31:59.570 --> 00:32:04.400
angle in n h 3 between the
n h bonds is smaller.

00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:08.470
And you can't see it with these
models because these are

00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:10.530
not actual lone pairs.

00:32:10.530 --> 00:32:12.580
But if they were actually
repelling each other, they

00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:16.510
would be pushing those bonds as
far away as possible, and

00:32:16.510 --> 00:32:18.340
instead of being 109 .

00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:21.680
5, you'd see that the
angle is now 106 .

00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:22.290
7.

00:32:22.290 --> 00:32:24.680
So it's a smaller angle between
bonds, because you

00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:26.580
have more repulsion from
those lone pairs

00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:29.830
pushing those bonds down.

00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:32.860
We can also think about the
influence of atomic size in

00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:34.390
terms of this effect.

00:32:34.390 --> 00:32:37.560
So first of all, what happens to
atomic size as you go down

00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:39.680
the periodic table?

00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:41.950
Good, it increases.

00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:45.830
So we have size increasing as we
go down the periodic table.

00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:48.370
Phosphorous is right underneath
nitrogen on the

00:32:48.370 --> 00:32:50.370
periodic table, so phosphorous
is going to

00:32:50.370 --> 00:32:51.900
be bigger than nitrogen.

00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:54.900
In terms of picturing what
happens with those lone pairs,

00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:57.690
when we have a larger atom, the
orbitals are also going to

00:32:57.690 --> 00:33:00.290
be larger, they can take
up more space.

00:33:00.290 --> 00:33:04.370
That means these electrons, this
lone pair electrons are

00:33:04.370 --> 00:33:06.240
going to take up more space.

00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:09.800
This means they're going to
push away those bonding

00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:11.580
electrons even more.

00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:14.150
So would you expect the
bond to be larger or

00:33:14.150 --> 00:33:16.040
smaller for p h 3?

00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:17.300
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:18.850
PROFESSOR: It's going
to be smaller.

00:33:18.850 --> 00:33:22.130
So, what we see is that angles
between bonded atoms actually

00:33:22.130 --> 00:33:25.990
decrease as you go down a column
on the periodic table.

00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:29.910
So the actual angles for p h 3
are now going to be really

00:33:29.910 --> 00:33:32.320
quite a bit smaller,
they're 93 .

00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:38.130
3 degrees.

00:33:38.130 --> 00:33:38.430
All right.

00:33:38.430 --> 00:33:42.140
So let's create a list for
ourselves in terms of all the

00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:45.300
geometries that we can have now
that we're dealing with

00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:46.950
lone pairs.

00:33:46.950 --> 00:33:49.740
One thing I want to point out
in terms of remembering the

00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:52.410
names of the different
geometries, when you're naming

00:33:52.410 --> 00:33:55.690
a geometry, the geometry name,
for example, when we looked at

00:33:55.690 --> 00:33:59.910
square planar, we're only
actually naming where the

00:33:59.910 --> 00:34:02.400
bonds are, where actual
atoms are.

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:05.020
The name doesn't really depend
on the lone pairs.

00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:07.810
And also, when you draw a
geometry, you don't always

00:34:07.810 --> 00:34:10.710
have to draw the lone pairs in,
but you have to remember

00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:13.910
that the lone pairs are very
much affecting the angles

00:34:13.910 --> 00:34:17.020
within your molecule and
also the actual shape.

00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:20.310
So, for example, let's start
talking about different types

00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:22.120
that have lone pairs in it.

00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:26.530
First of all, thinking about a
x 2 e, so we have one lone

00:34:26.530 --> 00:34:31.530
pair, and the geometry here is
bent, and I want you, thinking

00:34:31.530 --> 00:34:35.160
about lone pair repulsion, to
tell us what you think the

00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:44.160
angle between these bonds
are going to be?

00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:59.040
And let's take 10
seconds on that.

00:34:59.040 --> 00:34:59.650
OK, good.

00:34:59.650 --> 00:35:01.940
75%, that's not bad.

00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:07.920
Let's think about why.

00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:11.830
It's going to be less than 120
degrees, because we know that

00:35:11.830 --> 00:35:16.550
normally in a trigonal planar
situation, we have an angle of

00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:17.890
120 degrees.

00:35:17.890 --> 00:35:21.520
And since lone pairs are going
to cause more repulsion, we're

00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:25.060
actually pushing down these
two bonds here closer

00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:27.840
together, so what we end up
seeing is that they're going

00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:30.580
to be less than 120 degrees.

00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:35.110
And it depends on the actual
molecule what the exact angles

00:35:35.110 --> 00:35:37.570
are going to be, so you never
have to learn the exact angles

00:35:37.570 --> 00:35:39.940
in terms of lone pair electrons,
you just need to be

00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:42.170
able to tell us if the bond
angle is going to be less than

00:35:42.170 --> 00:35:44.870
120 degrees.

00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:49.250
So let's look at another example
here, a x 3 with one

00:35:49.250 --> 00:35:50.920
lone pair, e.

00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:53.170
This is called trigonal
pyramidal.

00:35:53.170 --> 00:35:56.810
Again, you have trigonal because
there's three atoms

00:35:56.810 --> 00:35:58.800
bonded to the central
atom, and this looks

00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:02.050
like a pyramid here.

00:36:02.050 --> 00:36:03.660
PROFESSOR: So, what would
the angle of this be?

00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:04.326
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:04.326 --> 00:36:09.680
PROFESSOR: I think I heard it.

00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:10.860
PROFESSOR: I think so, too.

00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:13.290
Less than 109 .

00:36:13.290 --> 00:36:14.960
5.

00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:18.500
Let's take another example,
a x 2 e 2.

00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:19.560
This is also bent.

00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:22.280
Tell us what the geometry -- we
told you the geometry, tell

00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:24.530
us what the bond angle
is going to be

00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:25.780
between these bonds.

00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:30.780
So, let's take 10
seconds on this.

00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:38.780
Let's re-poll F 4.

00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:52.690
So 10 seconds again.

00:36:52.690 --> 00:36:53.620
All right.

00:36:53.620 --> 00:36:57.230
In about 10 seconds, Darcy,
in 10 seconds we'll

00:36:57.230 --> 00:36:59.310
hit the next side.

00:36:59.310 --> 00:37:09.130
OK, so it's less than 109 .

00:37:09.130 --> 00:37:10.910
5 degrees now.

00:37:10.910 --> 00:37:15.680
So some of you wrote that it was
less than 120 degrees, and

00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:18.730
we can think about if we switch
back to the class notes

00:37:18.730 --> 00:37:20.700
the difference here.

00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:24.330
So even though, so this is now
going to be less than 109 .

00:37:24.330 --> 00:37:28.680
5, if we looked at the case we
had bent in the first case,

00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:31.920
that started with 120 and one
of those bonds was replaced

00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:35.730
with a lone pair, but now we
have two lone pairs here, so

00:37:35.730 --> 00:37:38.450
now what we're going to see is
that the two bents are not, in

00:37:38.450 --> 00:37:39.090
fact, equal.

00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:42.540
The bent where you started with
the tetrahedral shape is

00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:44.530
actually going to be
less than 109 .

00:37:44.530 --> 00:37:48.660
5, and Professor Drennan can
maybe show us that with the

00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:49.590
models here.

00:37:49.590 --> 00:37:52.340
PROFESSOR: It's a little had to
see, actually, between the

00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:59.826
two, but I think it's easier
to see on this, that if you

00:37:59.826 --> 00:38:03.970
consider the sort of starting
place for the two, if you look

00:38:03.970 --> 00:38:07.900
at the bottom set and you put
orbitals, so it also depends

00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:09.410
on your starting geometry.

00:38:09.410 --> 00:38:15.470
It can be bent if take off these
bonds on the top, but it

00:38:15.470 --> 00:38:18.890
depends on what the starting
geometries were.

00:38:18.890 --> 00:38:20.970
And so you will go with your
starting geometry,

00:38:20.970 --> 00:38:22.200
if it was 109 .

00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:23.670
5, it'll be less than that.

00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:26.450
If it's 120, then it's
less than that.

00:38:26.450 --> 00:38:28.050
PROFESSOR: So, this is a good
case of where, even when you

00:38:28.050 --> 00:38:30.310
have the geometry the same, you
need to think about how

00:38:30.310 --> 00:38:32.700
many lone pairs you're dealing
with in your molecule, and

00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:35.530
think about what would the
geometry be if I just pictured

00:38:35.530 --> 00:38:38.480
those lone pairs in there as
bonds and then push them even

00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:41.550
closer together so that it's
less than that actual angle.

00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:48.340
OK, let's talk about a x 4 e,
and that is what we call the

00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:49.450
seesaw shape.

00:38:49.450 --> 00:38:54.620
PROFESSOR: And so, what
difference in angles are you

00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:55.060
going to have?

00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:58.100
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:58.100 --> 00:38:58.390
PROFESSOR: Yup.

00:38:58.390 --> 00:39:02.640
PROFESSOR 2: So, two sets again,
one is less than 120,

00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:05.630
and one is going to
be less than 90.

00:39:05.630 --> 00:39:09.650
So, let's look at a x 3 e 2,
you'll notice there's a lot

00:39:09.650 --> 00:39:12.140
more combinations we can get
to once we're talking about

00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:13.630
lone pairs.

00:39:13.630 --> 00:39:17.460
This is called T-shaped, and we
had briefly discussed that

00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:21.270
but not mention what the
angles would be.

00:39:21.270 --> 00:39:22.730
PROFESSOR: So, what angle
would you have here?

00:39:22.730 --> 00:39:25.240
Yup.

00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:26.300
PROFESSOR: All right, great.

00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:28.320
Less than 90 degrees.

00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:34.300
So, we'll start a new page here
and talk about a x 2 e 3,

00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:41.270
and we'll let you tell us
what this geometry is.

00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:44.420
Yup, so I hear a lot of
linear out there.

00:39:44.420 --> 00:39:47.460
And you need to keep in mind
we give the names based on

00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:50.430
where the actual bonds are, not
where the lone pairs are,

00:39:50.430 --> 00:39:52.840
even though the lone pairs, of
course, affect the structure

00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:54.470
in the geometry.

00:39:54.470 --> 00:39:56.110
PROFESSOR: The angle?

00:39:56.110 --> 00:39:58.290
STUDENT: 180.

00:39:58.290 --> 00:39:58.860
PROFESSOR: Yup, 180.

00:39:58.860 --> 00:40:02.170
PROFESSOR: So, it's exactly
180 here, not less than.

00:40:02.170 --> 00:40:08.850
PROFESSOR: So, for a x 5 e, what
we have here is called

00:40:08.850 --> 00:40:09.620
square pyramidal.

00:40:09.620 --> 00:40:13.790
This is square because of the
four square at the bottom of

00:40:13.790 --> 00:40:16.310
your pyramid, then you can
picture the pyramid as you go

00:40:16.310 --> 00:40:17.080
to the top.

00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:21.990
PROFESSOR: And so what angles
would you have here?

00:40:21.990 --> 00:40:22.170
Yup, less than 90.

00:40:22.170 --> 00:40:26.230
PROFESSOR: So, less
than 90, great.

00:40:26.230 --> 00:40:32.770
All right, there are more.

00:40:32.770 --> 00:40:35.430
So, our next combination that
we can think about is if we

00:40:35.430 --> 00:40:40.800
have four bonded atoms and two
lone pairs, a x 4 e 2, that's

00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:42.710
going to be called
square planar.

00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:47.490
PROFESSOR: So, again, we have
square and it's planar.

00:40:47.490 --> 00:40:49.870
And so what are your
angles here?

00:40:49.870 --> 00:40:51.340
Yup, exactly 90.

00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:58.350
PROFESSOR: So next let's
look at a x 3 e 3.

00:40:58.350 --> 00:41:01.660
This is what we call T-shape,
this is also T-shape.

00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:08.560
PROFESSOR: And angle here?

00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:13.260
PROFESSOR: Yup, I think we heard
less than, it's less

00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:14.750
than 90 degrees.

00:41:14.750 --> 00:41:20.510
And let's look at a x 2 e 4, and
again, you guys can tell

00:41:20.510 --> 00:41:24.230
us what this geometry
is, first of all.

00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:25.220
Yup, it's linear.

00:41:25.220 --> 00:41:28.542
So, we have lots of different
ways we can get to a linear

00:41:28.542 --> 00:41:29.820
molecule, some of which have
lots of lone pairs, some of

00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:31.880
which have no lone
pairs at all.

00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:37.490
This is linear and
a 180 degrees.

00:41:37.490 --> 00:41:37.740
All right.

00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:40.770
So we'll do just a few examples
to show you some

00:41:40.770 --> 00:41:42.890
actual molecules that have
these geometries.

00:41:42.890 --> 00:41:45.540
We won't go through all of
them, because as we saw,

00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:47.670
there's lots of different
combinations we can have once

00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:49.910
we start getting into
lone pairs.

00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:53.800
The first we'll look at is water
here, and water is a

00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:57.320
good one to look at because we
had seen that at the beginning

00:41:57.320 --> 00:41:58.560
of class here when
we were talking

00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:00.800
about all polar molecules.

00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:03.860
When we talk about the formula
type of water, what when you

00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:07.330
say the formula type is?

00:42:07.330 --> 00:42:09.050
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:09.050 --> 00:42:11.350
PROFESSOR: A x 2 e 2,
that's correct.

00:42:11.350 --> 00:42:14.400
And what is the geometry
of water?

00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:16.250
It's bent.

00:42:16.250 --> 00:42:19.170
So what we saw at the beginning
of class is water is

00:42:19.170 --> 00:42:21.550
bent and now you can see why and
should be able to predict

00:42:21.550 --> 00:42:22.570
that yourself.

00:42:22.570 --> 00:42:25.200
I just want to mention that if
you look, and depending on the

00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:28.250
edition of the book you have,
in one edition it's called

00:42:28.250 --> 00:42:30.530
bent, in the other edition
it's called angular.

00:42:30.530 --> 00:42:33.590
We'll call it bent, but just
remember that bent and

00:42:33.590 --> 00:42:37.190
angular, they're the
same geometry.

00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:41.200
Let's look at another
example, s f 4.

00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:43.370
And here it is drawn here.

00:42:43.370 --> 00:42:49.560
What is the formula
type for s f 4?

00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:52.540
I think I heard it, a x 4 e.

00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:55.230
And the geometry?

00:42:55.230 --> 00:42:56.720
Seesaw, good.

00:42:56.720 --> 00:42:59.510
All right, we never get seesaw
wrong, that's the easy

00:42:59.510 --> 00:43:02.360
give-away one.

00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:05.870
All right, what about b r f 3?

00:43:05.870 --> 00:43:08.620
This is the shape here.

00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:13.560
What is the geometry for b f 3
-- the original geometry, not

00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:17.230
the new geometry here?

00:43:17.230 --> 00:43:18.210
What was that?

00:43:18.210 --> 00:43:19.620
STUDENT: T.

00:43:19.620 --> 00:43:21.300
PROFESSOR: T-shaped,
that's right.

00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:30.930
B f 3 is T-shaped.

00:43:30.930 --> 00:43:35.620
All right, so let's
look at xenon f 2.

00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:39.890
That's going to have a formula
type of a x 2 e 3, if we

00:43:39.890 --> 00:43:43.520
actually look at the Lewis
structure here.

00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:47.090
So if you think about what the
geometry is, and you should

00:43:47.090 --> 00:43:49.460
just be able to look at this
and see, what would you say

00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:52.350
the geometry of xenon f 2 is?

00:43:52.350 --> 00:43:53.950
STUDENT: Linear.

00:43:53.950 --> 00:43:55.230
PROFESSOR: Linear, good.

00:43:55.230 --> 00:43:55.710
All right.

00:43:55.710 --> 00:44:01.690
And let's try one more here,
which is a x 4 e 2, or a xenon

00:44:01.690 --> 00:44:06.110
f 4 -- very explosive,
but a good example.

00:44:06.110 --> 00:44:08.050
STUDENT: Square planar.

00:44:08.050 --> 00:44:10.000
PROFESSOR: Square planar,
all right, great.

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:14.550
So, in general, when we think
about vsper theory, even

00:44:14.550 --> 00:44:17.430
though it doesn't talk about or
tell us anything about the

00:44:17.430 --> 00:44:20.420
energies of these different
shapes, it's very useful in

00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:22.990
making a first approximation
and coming very close to

00:44:22.990 --> 00:44:26.810
thinking about what the actual
shapes of molecules are.

00:44:26.810 --> 00:44:28.810
So one thing I want to point
out in terms of what you're

00:44:28.810 --> 00:44:32.660
responsible for is you should
be able to fill out one of

00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:37.090
these charts with only seeing
the labels up here -- tell us

00:44:37.090 --> 00:44:40.430
the formula type, tell us the
steric number, tell us the

00:44:40.430 --> 00:44:43.190
geometry, you should be able to
draw the Lewis structure,

00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:45.200
you already know how to
do that, and also

00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:47.020
talk about the angles.

00:44:47.020 --> 00:44:50.900
So, as you finish up your
problem-set, you can, I think

00:44:50.900 --> 00:44:53.220
now, get through just
about all of it.

00:44:53.220 --> 00:44:55.720
You can do now this part
with the geometry.

00:44:55.720 --> 00:44:57.970
So, we'll see you on Wednesday
-- we're going to get out a

00:44:57.970 --> 00:44:59.940
little bit early today.
